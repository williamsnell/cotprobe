<think>
Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a particle moving in a circle. Let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on circular motion, but I'll take it slow.

So the problem says the particle is moving in a circle with a radius of 10 meters. At a certain instant, its speed is 10 m/s and it's increasing at a rate of 10 m/s². They're asking for the angle between the velocity and acceleration vectors.

Hmm, I remember that in circular motion, there are two components of acceleration: tangential and centripetal. The tangential acceleration is related to the change in speed, while the centripetal comes from the change in direction of the velocity.

Wait, the velocity vector is always tangent to the circle, pointing in the direction the particle is moving. The acceleration vector, though, has these two components. The tangential acceleration is along the tangent, same direction as velocity if speeding up, opposite if slowing down. The centripetal acceleration is directed towards the center of the circle, perpendicular to the velocity.

So the angle between velocity and acceleration would depend on the directions of these components. Since velocity is tangential, and centripetal is towards the center, the centripetal acceleration is perpendicular to velocity. But the tangential acceleration is in the same direction as velocity if it's speeding up or opposite if slowing down.

In this problem, the speed is increasing, so the tangential acceleration is in the same direction as the velocity. So the acceleration vector has two components: one in the direction of velocity (tangential) and one perpendicular to it (centripetal).

So the angle between them would be the angle between the tangential and centripetal components. Since these are perpendicular, wait, no. Wait, the centripetal component is directed towards the center, which is perpendicular to the tangent. Let me visualize: the velocity is along the tangent, and the acceleration has a part along the tangent (same direction as velocity) and another part perpendicular to it, pointing towards the center. So the angle between velocity and acceleration would be the angle between the velocity and the resultant acceleration vector.

Wait no, the acceleration vector is the sum of the tangential and centripetal components. So the resultant acceleration is a vector that's the combination of these two, which are perpendicular. So the angle between the velocity (which is tangential) and the acceleration would be determined by the directions of these two.

Wait, velocity is along the tangent. The acceleration has a tangential component in the same direction as velocity (since it's speeding up) and a centripetal component perpendicular to velocity, towards the center. So the acceleration vector is in the direction that's a combination of these two, making some angle with the velocity.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to calculate using vectors. Let's model this.

Velocity v is tangential, so its direction is along the tangent. Let's say it's along the positive x-axis for simplicity, so v is (v, 0), where v = 10 m/s.

The acceleration a has two components: a_t (tangential) and a_c (centripetal). a_t is along the tangent, same as v, so it's positive x direction. a_c is towards the center, so if the circle is centered at the origin, and the particle is moving along the positive x-axis, the center would be at (radius, 0) if the particle is at (radius, 0) at that instant. Wait, actually, when the particle is moving along the positive x, the center is at (radius, 0) if the particle is at (radius, 0), but that's when the circle is centered at the origin. Wait, perhaps it's better to model the velocity as along the positive y-axis, so the center is at (0, radius). Hmm, maybe that's complicating it. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to model the velocity as along the positive x-axis, and the center is at (0, 0), so the radius is 10 meters. Wait, no, that's not right. If the particle is moving in a circle of radius 10 meters, when its velocity is along the positive x-axis, the center must be at (10, 0), because the radius is in the direction perpendicular to the velocity. Wait, no, actually, in circular motion, the velocity is tangent to the circle, so the radius is directed from the center to the particle's position, and is perpendicular to the velocity. So if the velocity is along the positive x-axis at a point, the radius must be pointing in the positive y direction (if the center is above the x-axis) or negative y direction (if it's below). Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to model the velocity as pointing along the positive x-axis. Then, the center is at (0,10), because the radius is 10 meters. So the centripetal acceleration is directed towards the center, which would be in the positive y direction. So the centripetal acceleration a_c is (0, a_c), and the tangential acceleration a_t is along the velocity, which is (a_t, 0). So the total acceleration a is (a_t, a_c).

So the velocity vector v is (10, 0). The acceleration vector a is (a_t, a_c). Wait, but no, the centripetal acceleration is directed towards the center, so if the particle is moving along positive x, the center is at (0,10), so the centripetal acceleration is (0, -10) because the acceleration is towards the center. Wait no, wait: if the particle is at (10,0) moving along positive x, then the center is at (0,0), so the radius is from (0,0) to (10,0), so the centripetal acceleration is directed towards the center, which is (-10,0), so in the negative x direction. Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me think again. The centripetal acceleration is always directed towards the center of the circle. So if the particle is moving in a circle, at any point, the velocity is tangent to the circle. The center is at a point that's the radius away from the particle's position. So if the particle is at a point where its velocity is along the positive x-axis, then the center must be at (r,0) where r is the radius. Wait, no, no. Let me model it:

Imagine a circle centered at (0,0). The particle is at (10,0), moving along the positive x direction (tangent at that point). So the velocity vector is (10,0) m/s. The centripetal acceleration is towards the center, so from (10,0) to (0,0), which is in the negative x direction. So the centripetal acceleration is (-a_c, 0).

Meanwhile, the tangential acceleration a_t is along the velocity direction because the speed is increasing. So a_t is in the positive x direction.

So the total acceleration a is the vector sum of a_t (positive x) and a_c (negative x component? Wait, no. Wait, centripetal acceleration is towards the center. So if the particle is moving along positive x at (10,0), the center is at (0,0), so the centripetal acceleration is (-10 m/s², 0) if a_c is 10 m/s². Wait, no, because acceleration is in the direction towards the center, which is to the left, so negative x direction. So a_c is ( - (v²)/r , 0 ).

Wait, but wait, the formula for centripetal acceleration is a_c = v² / r, directed towards the center. So in this case, v is 10 m/s, r is 10 m, so a_c = (10)^2 / 10 = 10 m/s². So the centripetal acceleration is 10 m/s² towards the center, which is in the negative x direction.

So the acceleration vector a is the sum of the tangential acceleration (a_t) and the centripetal acceleration (a_c). Since the speed is increasing, a_t is in the same direction as velocity, which is positive x. So a_t is positive.

Given that the problem states the speed is increasing at 10 m/s². So a_t is 10 m/s² in the positive x direction.

Wait, wait no. Wait, the speed is increasing at 10 m/s². So the tangential acceleration a_t is 10 m/s² in the same direction as velocity, which is positive x.

So the acceleration vector a is (a_t, 0) for the tangential part and (-a_c, 0) for the centripetal. Wait, no, the centripetal acceleration is in the negative x direction, so a_c is (-10, 0) because a_c is 10 m/s² towards the center (which is left, negative x).

Wait, but wait, the centripetal acceleration is (v²)/r towards the center. So a_c = (10)^2 /10 =10 m/s². So the centripetal acceleration is directed towards the center, which is in the negative x direction for this setup. So the acceleration vector a is a_t (10 m/s² in +x) plus a_c (-10 m/s² in x). So a = (10, 0) + (-10, 0) = (0,0). That can't be right because then the acceleration would be zero, which contradicts the problem statement.

Wait, that can't be. Did I make a mistake here?

Wait, no, the problem states that the speed is increasing at 10 m/s². So a_t is 10 m/s². The centripetal acceleration is 10 m/s² as well. So if the particle is moving along positive x and the center is at (0,0), then a_c is -10 m/s² in x. So a_t is +10 in x, a_c is -10 in x. So the total acceleration would be (10 + (-10) ) in x, which is zero. But that's not possible because the acceleration can't be zero. So where did I go wrong?

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the direction of the centripetal acceleration. Let me make sure. The velocity is along the tangent, which is positive x. The center is at (0,0), so the radius from (10,0) to (0,0) is along negative x. Thus, the centripetal acceleration is towards the center, which is negative x direction. So a_c is in negative x.

But the tangential acceleration is in the direction of velocity, which is positive x. So a_t is in positive x.

So then, a_t is +10 m/s², a_c is -10 m/s². Adding them, the x-component is 10 -10 = 0. So the acceleration would have only a y-component? That can't be right because I'm not considering the centripetal direction correctly.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. The centripetal acceleration is not along the x-axis. Wait, no, in this scenario, the particle is at (10,0), moving along positive x, so the centripetal acceleration is towards the center at (0,0), which is along negative x. So the a_c is along negative x.

But if a_t is 10 m/s² along positive x, and a_c is 10 m/s² along negative x, then the x-components would cancel each other, leading to zero acceleration in x. But that's only if a_t equals a_c. But in the problem, a_t is 10 m/s², and a_c is (v²)/r = 100/10 =10 m/s². So a_c is 10 m/s² towards the center, which is negative x.

So the acceleration vector a would be a_t (10,0) plus a_c (-10,0), which gives (0,0). That can't be right because then the acceleration is zero, which contradicts the problem. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, maybe the centripetal acceleration isn't in the same line as the velocity. Wait, no, in this setup, the centripetal acceleration is along the radius, which is perpendicular to the velocity. Wait, no, if the velocity is along the tangent, the radius is perpendicular to it, so the centripetal acceleration is perpendicular to the velocity. So in my earlier setup, the velocity is along positive x, the radius is along negative x, but wait, that's not perpendicular. Wait, no, wait: the radius is from the center to the particle, which is along negative x in this case, and the velocity is along positive x. So the radius is along negative x, and the velocity is along positive x, so they are in opposite directions, which are colinear, not perpendicular. That can't be right.

Ah, I see my mistake. The radius is from the center to the particle's position, and the velocity is tangent to the circle, so the velocity is perpendicular to the radius. Therefore, if the particle is at (10,0), moving along positive x, the radius is along negative x. So the velocity is along positive x, which is perpendicular to the radius (negative x). So the centripetal acceleration is along the radius, which is negative x. So the centripetal acceleration is in the same direction as the radius vector, which is towards the center.

So in this setup, the velocity is along positive x, and the centripetal acceleration is along negative x. But the tangential acceleration is along positive x because the speed is increasing.

So, the acceleration vector is the sum of the tangential and centripetal components.

Wait, but wait, the velocity is along positive x, and the centripetal acceleration is along negative x. But the tangential acceleration is along positive x. So the total acceleration a is a_t (positive x) plus a_c (negative x). So a = (a_t, 0) + (a_c, 0) where a_c is negative. So in this case, a_t is 10 m/s², a_c is -10 m/s² because centripetal acceleration is 10 m/s² towards the center (negative x). So a = (10 -10, 0) = (0, 0). That can't be right because that would imply zero acceleration.

But the problem states that the speed is increasing at 10 m/s², which is the tangential acceleration. So where's the mistake?

Oh wait, perhaps I messed up the centripetal acceleration. The centripetal acceleration is (v²)/r, which is 10²/10=10 m/s². So a_c is 10 m/s² towards the center. So if the particle is moving along positive x, the center is at (0,0), so the centripetal acceleration is along negative x, so a_c is (-10, 0).

The tangential acceleration a_t is 10 m/s² in the positive x direction. So the acceleration vector is a = a_t + a_c = (10, 0) + (-10, 0) = (0, 0). That can't be right because the acceleration can't be zero. So I must have made a wrong assumption in the setup.

Wait, no, the particle is moving in a circle, so the acceleration can't be zero. So perhaps I made a mistake in the direction of the centripetal acceleration.

Wait, perhaps the centripetal acceleration is not in the same line as the tangential acceleration. Wait, because the centripetal acceleration is always perpendicular to the velocity, which is along the tangent. So in this case, if the velocity is along positive x, the centripetal acceleration should be in the perpendicular direction, which would be positive y or negative y. Wait, that makes more sense. Because in circular motion, the centripetal acceleration is directed towards the center, which is perpendicular to the velocity, not along the radius. Oh wait, no, the radius is from the center to the particle, which is perpendicular to the velocity, so the centripetal acceleration is along the radius, which is perpendicular to the velocity.

Wait, I think I confused myself earlier. Let me clarify: the velocity is always tangent to the circle, and the radius is from the center to the particle, which is perpendicular to the velocity. So, for a particle moving along positive x, the radius is pointing in the positive y direction (if the center is above the x-axis) or negative y. Wait, no, if the center is at (0,0) and the particle is at (0,10), moving along positive x, then the radius is along positive y, and the velocity is along positive x, which is perpendicular. So in that case, the centripetal acceleration is along the radius, which is positive y. So the acceleration would have a component along positive y (centripetal) and a component along positive x (tangential, since speed is increasing).

So in this setup, the velocity is (10,0). The tangential acceleration a_t is along positive x, so (10,0). The centripetal acceleration a_c is towards the center, which is at (0,0) from (0,10), so it's along negative y, because the particle is at (0,10), so the radius points downward. Wait, no, if the particle is moving along positive x, then its position is (0,10), and the center is at (0,0). So the radius is from (0,0) to (0,10), which is along positive y. So the centripetal acceleration is towards the center, so from (0,10) to (0,0), which is along negative y. So a_c is (0, -10).

So the acceleration vector a is (a_t, a_c) = (10, -10). So a = (10, -10).

The velocity vector v is (10,0).

So the angle between v and a is the angle between (10,0) and (10, -10).

To find the angle between two vectors, we can use the dot product formula:

cosθ = (v · a) / (|v| |a|)

v · a = (10)(10) + (0)(-10) = 100 + 0 = 100.

|v| = sqrt(10^2 + 0^2) = 10.

|a| = sqrt(10^2 + (-10)^2) = sqrt(100 + 100) = sqrt(200) = 10√2.

So cosθ = 100 / (10 * 10√2) ) = 100/(100√2) ) = 1/√2 ≈ 0.7071.

So θ = arccos(1/√2) = 45 degrees.

Wait, but the options include 45°, which is option F.

Wait, but let me double-check my setup. Earlier, I thought the centripetal acceleration was along negative x, but that led to a problem. So in this correct setup, the centripetal acceleration is along negative y, so the acceleration vector is (10, -10), and the velocity is (10, 0). The angle between them is 45 degrees below the x-axis, which is 45 degrees.

So the angle between velocity and acceleration is 45 degrees, so the answer should be F: 45°.

Wait, but wait, the problem says the speed is increasing at 10 m/s², so a_t is 10 m/s² in the direction of velocity. The centripetal acceleration is a_c = v²/r = (10)^2/10=10 m/s², directed towards the center, which is perpendicular to velocity. So the angle between velocity (tangential) and acceleration (which has both tangential and centripetal components) is 45 degrees.

Yes, that makes sense.
</think>

In circular motion, the velocity vector is tangent to the circle, and the acceleration vector has two components: tangential and centripetal. The tangential acceleration \( a_t \) is responsible for changes in the speed and is directed along the tangent, while the centripetal acceleration \( a_c \) is directed toward the center of the circle and is perpendicular to the velocity.

Given:
- Radius \( r = 10 \, \text{m} \)
- Speed \( v = 10 \, \text{m/s} \)
- Tangential acceleration \( a_t = 10 \, \text{m/s}^2 \) (since the speed is increasing)
- Centripetal acceleration \( a_c = \frac{v^2}{r} = \frac{10^2}{10} = 10 \, \text{m/s}^2 \)

The velocity vector \( \vec{v} \) is along the tangent, and the acceleration vector \( \vec{a} \) is the vector sum of \( a_t \) (along the tangent) and \( a_c \) (toward the center, perpendicular to the tangent). To find the angle \( \theta \) between \( \vec{v} \) and \( \vec{a} \), we use the dot product formula:

\[
\cos\theta = \frac{\vec{v} \cdot \vec{a}}{|\vec{v}| |\vec{a}|}
\]

Assume \( \vec{v} \) is along the positive \( x \)-axis: \( \vec{v} = (10, 0) \). The acceleration vector \( \vec{a} \) has components:
- \( a_t = 10 \, \text{m/s}^2 \) along the \( x \)-axis
- \( a_c = 10 \, \text{m/s}^2 \) toward the center (negative \( y \)-axis)

Thus, \( \vec{a} = (10, -10) \).

Now calculate:
- \( \vec{v} \cdot \vec{a} = (10)(10) + (0)(-10) = 100 \)
- \( |\vec{v}| = \sqrt{10^2 + 0^2} = 10 \)
- \( |\vec{a}| = \sqrt{10^2 + (-10)^2} = \sqrt{200} = 10\sqrt{2} \)

\[
\cos\theta = \frac{100}{10 \cdot 10\sqrt{2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \implies \theta = \arccos\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right) = 45^\circ
\]

Thus, the angle between the velocity and acceleration vectors is **45°**.

**Answer:** F
