Okay, so I have this physics problem about strings and their frequencies. Hmm. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I remember that the frequency of a vibrating string depends on several factors: tension, length, mass, and the material. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula, so I'll try to recall.

Wait, I think the formula for the frequency of a string is given by the equation f = (1/(2L)) * sqrt(T/μ), where:
- f is the frequency,
- L is the length of the string,
- T is the tension,
- μ is the linear mass density (mass per unit length).

Right, so both strings are 100 cm long, which is 1 meter. But their masses are different. The first string has a mass of 4 grams, and the second has 1 gram. They're under the same tension, so T is the same for both.

The first string's frequency is 250 vibrations per second. I need to find the frequency of the second string under the same tension.

Since the length L is the same for both, I can set up a ratio between the two frequencies. Let me denote f1 as the frequency of the first string and f2 as the frequency of the second string.

So, f1 = (1/(2L)) * sqrt(T/μ1)
And f2 = (1/(2L)) * sqrt(T/μ2)

If I take the ratio f2/f1, the (1/(2L)) and T terms will cancel out, leaving me with sqrt(μ1/μ2). Wait, no, wait. Let me see: f2/f1 = sqrt(μ2/μ1). Because when you take the ratio, the sqrt(T) terms cancel, and the μ is in the denominator inside the square root.

Wait, let me correct that. The formula is f = (1/(2L)) * sqrt(T/μ). So f is proportional to 1/sqrt(μ). So if μ increases, frequency decreases, and vice versa.

So f2/f1 = sqrt(μ1/μ2). Wait no, let me do it carefully. Let's write:

f1 = (1/(2L)) * sqrt(T/μ1)
f2 = (1/(2L)) * sqrt(T/μ2)

Dividing f2 by f1: (f2)/(f1) = sqrt( (T/μ2) ) / sqrt( (T/μ1) ) ) = sqrt( (μ1)/(μ2) )

Because sqrt(a/b) is sqrt(a)/sqrt(b), so when you flip, it's sqrt(b/a) when inverted.

Wait, let me rearrange it correctly. Let me take f2/f1:

(f2)/(f1) = [sqrt(T/μ2)] / [sqrt(T/μ1)] ) = sqrt( (T/μ2) / (T/μ1) ) ) = sqrt( (μ1)/(μ2) )

Because T cancels in numerator and denominator inside the square root.

So f2 = f1 * sqrt( μ1 / μ2 )

Wait, but μ is mass per unit length. The first string has mass 4 grams, so μ1 is 4g/m. The second string has mass 1g, so μ2 is 1g/m. So μ1 is 4 times μ2.

Wait, wait. Let me compute μ1 and μ2 correctly. The first string is 100 cm (1m) long, mass 4 grams. So μ1 = 4g/m. The second string is same length, 100 cm, mass 1g, so μ2 = 1g/m.

So μ1 = 4 * μ2. Because 4 grams is four times 1 gram.

So putting that into the ratio: f2 = f1 * sqrt( μ1 / μ2 ) = f1 * sqrt(4μ2 / μ2) )= f1 * sqrt(4) = f1 * 2.

Wait, but wait. Because μ1 is 4g/m, and μ2 is 1g/m. So μ1/μ2 = 4/1 =4. So sqrt(4) is 2. So f2 = f1 * 2. Since f1 is 250 vps, f2 would be 500 vps.

Wait, but that's option E. So the correct answer is E:500vps.

But wait, let me think again. Because I might have the ratio inverted. Because if μ increases, frequency decreases, since f is inversely proportional to sqrt(μ). So when μ2 is smaller than μ1, f2 should be higher than f1.

Wait, let me check again. The formula is f = (1/(2L)) * sqrt(T/μ). So for the same T and L, f is inversely proportional to sqrt(μ). So if μ increases, f decreases. So a string with lower μ (lighter) will have higher frequency.

In this case, the second string is lighter, so its frequency should be higher than 250 vps. Wait, but according to my earlier calculation, it's 500 vps, which is higher. So that makes sense.

But wait, in my earlier step, I think I might have made a mistake in the ratio calculation.

Let me redo the ratio.

f2 / f1 = sqrt(μ1 / μ2 )

Because the formula is f proportional to 1/sqrt(μ). So if μ1 is larger than μ2, f1 would be smaller than f2.

Wait, no. Let me think: If μ increases, f decreases. So if μ2 is smaller than μ1, then f2 should be higher than f1.

In the problem, the first string has μ1=4g/m, the second μ2=1g/m. So μ2 is less than μ1, so f2 should be higher than f1=250.

So using the ratio f2/f1 = sqrt(μ1/μ2) = sqrt(4/1) = 2. So f2=250 * 2 =500 vps.

Which is option E. Hmm, that's correct.

Wait, but wait another way. Let me calculate μ for each.

μ1 = 4g/m = 0.004 kg/m. Because 1g is 0.001 kg. So 4g is 0.004 kg.

μ2 =1g/m =0.001 kg/m.

Then, the formula for frequency is f = (1/(2L)) * sqrt(T/μ)

Since L is same, and T is same, then f is inversely proportional to sqrt(μ).

So f ∝ 1/sqrt(μ). So f2 = f1 * (μ1/μ2)^0.5.

Which is f1 * sqrt(μ1/μ2) = 250 * sqrt(4/1) =250*2=500.

Yes, that's correct.

So the answer should be E:500vps.

The frequency of a vibrating string is given by the formula:

\[
f = \frac{1}{2L} \sqrt{\frac{T}{\mu}}
\]

where \( f \) is the frequency, \( L \) is the length of the string, \( T \) is the tension, and \( \mu \) is the linear mass density (mass per unit length). Since both strings have the same length (\( L = 100 \, \text{cm} \)) and are under the same tension (\( T \)), the frequency is inversely proportional to the square root of the linear mass density (\( \mu \)):

\[
f \propto \frac{1}{\sqrt{\mu}}
\]

For the first string, \( \mu_1 = \frac{4 \, \text{g}}{100 \, \text{cm}} = 0.04 \, \text{g/cm} \), and its frequency is \( f_1 = 250 \, \text{vps} \). For the second string, \( \mu_2 = \frac{1 \, \text{g}}{100 \, \text{cm}} = 0.01 \, \text{g/cm} \). The ratio of the frequencies is:

\[
\frac{f_2}{f_1} = \sqrt{\frac{\mu_1}{\mu_2}} = \sqrt{\frac{4}{1}} = 2
\]

Thus, \( f_2 = 2 \times f_1 = 2 \times 250 = 500 \, \text{vps} \).

The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{E}
\]
