Okay, so I've got this question about scheduling jobs on a single processor to minimize the average completion time. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the problem states that at time 0, there are five jobs available. Their service times are 25, 15, 5, 3, and 2 time units. I need to find the minimum average completion time, and the options are given as A through J.

I remember that in scheduling theory, the Shortest Processing Time (SPT) first algorithm is optimal for minimizing the average completion time. That makes sense because processing shorter jobs first reduces the waiting time for all subsequent jobs, which should lower the overall average.

So, the first thing I should do is sort the jobs in increasing order of their service times. Let me list them out:

Original service times: 25, 15, 5, 3, 2.

Sorting them from shortest to longest: 2, 3, 5, 15, 25.

Now, I'll calculate the completion times for each job in this order. The completion time of a job is the time at which it finishes execution. Since there's only one processor, each job starts right after the previous one finishes.

Let's go step by step:

1. First job: service time 2. Completion time is 2.
2. Second job: service time 3. It starts at 2, so completion time is 2+3=5.
3. Third job: service time 5. Starts at 5, so finishes at 5+5=10.
4. Fourth job: service time 15. Starts at 10, finishes at 10+15=25.
5. Fifth job: service time 25. Starts at 25, finishes at 25+25=50.

Now, I'll list the completion times: 2, 5, 10, 25, 50.

Next, I need to compute the average completion time. To find the average, I'll sum all the completion times and divide by the number of jobs, which is 5.

Sum = 2 + 5 + 10 + 25 + 50.

Calculating the sum: 2+5=7; 7+10=17; 17+25=42; 42+50=92.

So, the total is 92. Now, average is 92 divided by 5, which is 18.4. Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see 18.4. Hmm, maybe I should represent it as a fraction.

92 divided by 5 is 92/5, which is 18.4. Let me check the options again. Option G is 92/5, which is exactly what I have.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Job 1: completion at 2. Correct.
Job 2: starts at 2, ends at 5. Correct.
Job 3: starts at 5, ends at 10. Correct.
Job 4: starts at 10, ends at 25. Correct.
Job 5: starts at 25, ends at 50. Correct.

Summing them: 2+5=7, +10=17, +25=42, +50=92. Yes, that's correct.

So the average is 92/5, which is option G.

Wait, but let me check the options again to make sure. The options are:

A: 40
B:10
C:76/5
D:100/5
E:60
F:208/5
G:92/5
H:30
I:20
J:50

Yes, option G is 92/5. So that's the correct answer.
</think>

The minimum average completion time is achieved by scheduling jobs in increasing order of their service times using the SPT algorithm. The completion times are 2, 5, 10, 25, and 50. The average is 92/5, which corresponds to option G.

Answer: G
