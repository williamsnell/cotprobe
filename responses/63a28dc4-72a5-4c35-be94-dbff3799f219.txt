Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about pricing policies, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand it.

The question is asking which pricing policy results in setting a price higher than the competitive price in an industry. The options are A through I, each representing a different pricing strategy.

First, I should probably go through each option one by one and understand what each pricing policy entails. Let's list them out:

A: Competitive pricing
B: Penetration pricing
C: Cost-plus pricing
D: Dual pricing
E: Value-based pricing
F: Transfer pricing
G: Predatory pricing
H: Collusive pricing
I: Bundle pricing

Alright, now I'll try to remember or think through each of these.

Starting with A: Competitive pricing. From what I recall, competitive pricing is when a company sets its prices based on what competitors are charging. So, the price is about the same as what others in the industry are offering. It's about matching or sometimes slightly adjusting based on differentiation. So, this probably doesn't result in a higher price than competitors because it's based on their prices.

B: Penetration pricing. Penetration pricing is when a company sets a low initial price to enter a market quickly and gain market share. The idea is to attract a lot of customers, so the price is lower than competitors. So this would be lower, not higher, so B is out.

C: Cost-plus pricing. This method adds a markup to the cost to ensure a profit. The markup can vary, but the main idea is to cover costs and make a profit. However, it doesn't directly consider competitors' prices. So if a competitor's price is lower, this could result in a higher price, but I'm not certain. I'll keep this in mind but check other options too.

D: Dual pricing. Dual pricing is when a company charges different prices to different customers for the same product. For example, students might get a discount. But this doesn't necessarily make the price higher than the competitive price overall; it just varies among customers. So maybe not the answer, but I'm not sure yet.

E: Value-based pricing. This approach sets prices based on the perceived value to the customer, not just cost or competition. If customers see a lot of value, they might pay a higher price. So this could potentially set a price higher than competitors if the value is high enough. This seems like a possible candidate.

F: Transfer pricing. This is more common in multinational companies and refers to pricing goods or services transferred between divisions or subsidiaries. It's often used for tax purposes and isn't really about external customer pricing. So probably not relevant here.

G: Predatory pricing. This is when a company sets prices very low, even below cost, to drive competitors out of the market. Once competitors are gone, they can raise prices. So this is a lower price initially but not a high one. So G is not the answer.

H: Collusive pricing. This occurs when companies agree to set prices together, effectively acting like a monopoly. So they set prices higher than competitive because they're colluding to fix prices, maybe above the market rate. This sounds like it could be the answer because it's about setting prices higher than the competitive level by agreement.

I: Bundle pricing. This is when products are sold together as a package, sometimes at a discount. For example, buying a phone with a service plan. But this depends on how it's structured. It might not necessarily result in a higher price, unless the bundle is priced high. But I'm not sure if this is the intended answer.

So, let's evaluate the options again. The question is which policy results in a price higher than competitive.

- A: Competitive, so same as others. Not higher.
- B: Penetration, lower.
- C: Cost-plus, could be higher or lower depending on costs and markup relative to competitors.
- D: Dual, varies, not necessarily higher overall.
- E: Value-based, could be higher if value is high, but depends on the market.
- H: Collusive, yes, because companies agree to set higher prices together.

Wait, but in competitive industries, collusion is illegal in many places, so maybe the question is more theoretical. But regardless, if they collude, they can set higher prices. So H seems like a possible correct answer.

But wait, another thought: Cost-plus (C) doesn't directly compare to competitors. If a company's costs are higher than competitors', adding a markup could result in a higher price. So if the industry's competitive price is based on lower costs, then C could result in a higher price.

So, which one is it? The question is which policy results in a higher price than the competitive price.

If a company uses cost-plus, they might set a price higher than competitors if their costs are higher or if the markup is higher. But it's not guaranteed because sometimes companies might adjust based on the market.

On the other hand, collusive pricing is a deliberate agreement to set prices above the competitive level, so that's a sure way. Therefore, H would be the correct answer.

Alternatively, value-based pricing (E) could also result in a higher price if the perceived value is high enough, but it depends on customer perception. The question is about which policy results in a higher price, so E could be a contender.

But the question is about the policy that "results in establishment of a price to external customers higher than the competitive price". So collusive pricing is about setting prices together, which would be higher than the competitive (non-collusive) price.

Alternatively, transfer pricing (F) is internal, so not relevant here.

So, I think H: Collusive pricing is the correct answer.

The question asks which pricing policy results in setting a price higher than the competitive price in an industry. After analyzing each option:

- **A: Competitive pricing** aligns with competitors' prices, not higher.
- **B: Penetration pricing** sets lower prices to gain market share.
- **C: Cost-plus pricing** may result in higher prices if costs or markup are higher than competitors.
- **D: Dual pricing** varies prices among customers but doesn't guarantee a higher price overall.
- **E: Value-based pricing** can set higher prices if perceived value is high.
- **F: Transfer pricing** is internal and irrelevant to external customer pricing.
- **G: Predatory pricing** sets low prices to drive competitors out, not higher.
- **H: Collusive pricing** involves agreements to set higher prices together, ensuring a price above competitive levels.
- **I: Bundle pricing** depends on structure and may not guarantee a higher price.

While **C: Cost-plus pricing** and **E: Value-based pricing** could result in higher prices, **H: Collusive pricing** directly involves setting prices above competitive levels through agreements. Therefore, the correct answer is:

H
