Question:

A user enters a Web address in a browser, and a request for a file is sent to a Web server. Which of the following best describes how the file is sent to the user?

Options:

A: The server attempts to connect directly to the user's computer. If the connection is successful, the entire file is sent. If the connection is unsuccessful, an error message is sent to the user.
B: The file is broken into packets for transmission. The user's browser must request each packet randomly until all packets are received.
C: The server compresses the file into a single packet for transmission. The user's browser decompresses the packet upon receipt.
D: The server repeatedly attempts to connect directly to the user's computer until a connection is made. Once the connection is made, the entire file is sent.
E: The file is broken into packets for transmission. The packets must be reassembled upon receipt.
F: The file is broken into packets for transmission. The user's browser must request each packet in order until all packets are received.
G: The server sends each packet to the user's computer, which must confirm receipt of each packet before the next one is sent.
H: The file is sent in separate sections, which are downloaded sequentially by the user's browser.
I: The server sends the file in a continuous stream to the user's browser, which buffers the stream for viewing.
J: The server sends the entire file in one large transmission to the user's browser.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how a file is sent from a web server to a user's browser when they enter a web address. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that when you type a URL into a browser, the browser sends a request to the web server. The server then sends back the requested file. But how exactly does that happen?

I think about how data is transmitted over the internet. I've heard terms like packets, TCP/IP, HTTP, etc. So, the server doesn't just send the entire file at once, right? Because the internet is a network of many computers, and data is broken down into smaller parts to manage transmission more efficiently.

Looking at the options:

Option A: The server tries to connect directly. If successful, sends the entire file. If not, sends an error. That sounds a bit off because servers don't typically make direct connections; clients initiate connections. So the server might not connect directly but waits for the client to connect.

Option B: File is broken into packets, and the browser requests each randomly. Hmm, I don't think browsers request packets randomly. It's more about ordered delivery because the file needs to be assembled correctly.

Option C: Compressed into a single packet. That's unlikely because large files can't fit into one packet. Plus, compression might happen, but transmission in a single packet isn't standard for most files.

Option D: Server repeatedly tries to connect until it works, then sends the file. Again, the server doesn't initiate connections; the client does via a three-way handshake in TCP.

Option E: Packets are sent and reassembled. This makes sense because data is sent in packets, which are then put back together by the receiver. So the browser gets all the packets and then reconstructs the file.

Option F: Browser requests each packet in order. I'm not sure about this. The browser might request the file as a whole, and the server sends it as packets, but the browser doesn't request each packet individually. The server breaks it into packets on its own.

Option G: Each packet is sent with confirmation before the next. That's how TCP worksâ€”acknowledgments are sent to ensure packets are received. So the server sends a packet, waits for an ACK, then sends the next.

Option H: Sent in separate sections downloaded sequentially. This sounds similar to E, but maybe without reassembling. But I think the browser does reassemble the packets, so E might be better.

Option I: Continuous stream buffered for viewing. That's how streaming works, but most files aren't streamed; they're downloaded first. Though some content like videos might stream.

Option J: Sent as one large transmission. Not possible for large files due to network constraints and packet size limits.

So, the correct process is that the file is broken into packets. The server sends these packets, and the browser receives them, then reassembles them to form the original file. So option E seems correct because it mentions packets and reassembling upon receipt.

Wait, but option G also mentions packets and confirmation. But does the browser request each packet? No, the server sends the packets, and the browser doesn't have to request each one. The server uses TCP, which handles this with ACKs, so the server sends packets, and the browser acknowledges them. But the question is about how the file is sent, not the protocol details. So the best answer is E because it's about breaking into packets and reassembling.

The correct answer is E: The file is broken into packets for transmission. The packets must be reassembled upon receipt. This is because data transmission over the internet typically involves breaking files into smaller packets, which are then sent and reassembled by the receiver.

Answer: E
