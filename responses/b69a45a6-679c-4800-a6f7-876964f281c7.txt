Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about blood samples and what's higher after someone eats breakfast. Let me break it down step by step.

The question says a 45-year-old man had his blood taken after breaking his overnight fast with three slices of toast and a boiled egg. We need to compare the concentration of certain substances in his blood after breakfast versus before.

First, I should think about what happens when someone eats after fasting. Fasting usually means the body has been using stored energy, like glycogen and fat. Once you start eating, especially carbohydrates, the body processes them into glucose, which affects various hormones and substances in the blood.

Let me look at each option:

A: Cholesterol. I know that cholesterol levels can vary, but I'm not sure if they'd spike immediately after a meal. Maybe after a high-fat meal, but toast and egg aren't super high in fat. I think cholesterol might increase, but I'm not certain it's the highest here.

B: Lactate. Lactate is produced during anaerobic respiration, usually when muscles are working hard. After eating, especially carbs, the body's insulin levels go up, which can promote lactate conversion to glucose. Not sure if lactate would be higher after eating, maybe not.

C: Glucose. This seems obvious. After eating, especially carbs like toast, blood glucose should rise. Before breakfast, during fasting, glucose levels are lower. So after eating, glucose should be higher.

D: Ketone bodies. These are produced when the body breaks down fat for energy, typically when fasting or on a low-carb diet. If someone just ate, especially carbs, the body doesn't need to use as much fat, so ketone bodies might decrease. So their concentration would be lower after breakfast.

E: Glycogen. Glycogen is stored in the liver and muscles. After eating, the body converts excess glucose into glycogen. But blood levels of glycogen aren't really measured directly because it's stored. So this might not be the right answer.

F: Pyruvate. Pyruvate is a product of glycolysis, the breakdown of glucose. After eating, more glucose is available, so more glycolysis occurs, leading to higher pyruvate. But is it higher than before? I think so, but I'm not sure if it's the highest compared to others.

G: Non-esterified fatty acids (NEFAs). These are free fatty acids in the blood. During fasting, the body releases more fats into the bloodstream. After eating, especially carbs, insulin is released which tends to lower NEFAs because the body is using glucose instead. So NEFAs would be lower after breakfast.

So, the options that would likely be higher after breakfast are C (glucose) and F (pyruvate). But I'm more confident about glucose. Let me think again. When you eat, especially carbs, the blood glucose rises, which is why diabetics check their blood sugar after meals. Pyruvate is a step in glucose metabolism, so it would rise, but perhaps not as significantly as glucose itself.

Therefore, the correct answer should be C: Glucose.

After considering the effects of eating breakfast on blood components, the concentration of glucose will be higher after breakfast due to the intake of carbohydrates. 

Answer: C
