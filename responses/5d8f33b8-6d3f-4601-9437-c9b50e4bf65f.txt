Okay, so I have this physics problem here about an elevator and determining the tension in the cables. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my mechanics, but let me think this through.

The question is asking which values are needed to find the tension in the cables pulling the elevator. The options are A through J, each with different combinations of mass, velocity, height, acceleration, and friction.

Alright, I remember that tension in a cable can be calculated using Newton's second law. The basic idea is that the net force on an object is equal to its mass times acceleration (F=ma). In the case of an elevator, the forces involved are the tension from the cable pulling up and the gravitational force pulling down.

So, the equation would be T - mg = ma, where T is tension, m is mass, g is acceleration due to gravity, and a is the elevator's acceleration. From this, I can solve for tension: T = m(g + a).

Wait, but does this require knowing the velocity or height? Let me think. The equation I have doesn't involve velocity or height directly. Velocity might come into play if acceleration isn't given, but in this problem, acceleration is probably known because the elevator is rising. So maybe I don't need velocity or height.

Wait, but what if I don't know the acceleration? Then I might need to calculate it, which could involve velocity and the time it took to change velocity, like acceleration a = (v_f - v_i)/t. But the question is about what values are needed to determine the tension, not how to find acceleration.

So, if I already have the acceleration, then I only need mass and acceleration. Because T = m(g + a). But wait, the options don't have just mass and acceleration. Let me look at the options again.

Option G is mass and acceleration. That would fit if acceleration is known. But wait, in the equation, g is a constant, so maybe I don't need to include it as a separate variable. The problem is about the elevator's values, so perhaps g is known and not part of the variables we need to provide.

Wait, but the question is about the values for the elevator, not the environment. So maybe mass and acceleration are sufficient because the gravitational acceleration is a known constant. So then the necessary values are mass and acceleration.

Looking at the options, option G is mass and acceleration. So that would be the answer. But wait, let me check other options. Option I is mass, acceleration, and friction. But if there's friction involved, that would affect the tension. But the problem doesn't mention friction, so I don't think we need to consider it unless it's part of the setup.

Wait, the equation I had earlier was T = m(g + a). So I don't think friction is involved here unless the problem is more complex. Since the problem doesn't mention friction, I can probably ignore it.

So, the only variables needed are mass and acceleration. So the correct answer should be G: Mass and acceleration.

To determine the tension in the cables pulling an elevator, we use Newton's second law: \( T - mg = ma \), where \( T \) is tension, \( m \) is mass, \( g \) is gravitational acceleration (a constant), and \( a \) is the elevator's acceleration. Rearranging gives \( T = m(g + a) \). This equation shows that only mass and acceleration are needed to calculate tension. Other variables like velocity, height, or friction aren't required for this calculation.

Answer: G
