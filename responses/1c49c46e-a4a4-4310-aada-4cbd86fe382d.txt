Question:

The height (in meters) of a shot cannonball follows a trajectory given by $h(t) = -4.9t^2 + 14t - 0.4$ at time $t$ (in seconds). As an improper fraction, for how long is the cannonball above a height of $6$ meters?

Options:

A: \frac{5}{12}
B: \frac{7}{14}
C: \frac{14}{7}
D: \frac{12}{7}
E: \frac{5}{7}
F: \frac{6}{7}
G: \frac{7}{5}
H: \frac{9}{7}
I: \frac{7}{12}
J: \frac{8}{7}

Okay, so I've got this problem about a cannonball's height over time, and I need to find out for how long it's above 6 meters. The equation given is h(t) = -4.9t² + 14t - 0.4. Hmm, right. Since the question is about when the cannonball is above 6 meters, I think I need to find the times when h(t) equals 6 and then figure out the duration between those times.

Let me start by setting up the equation:

-4.9t² + 14t - 0.4 = 6.

Wait, no, actually, I should subtract 6 from both sides to set the equation to zero because I need to solve for when h(t) is greater than 6. So:

-4.9t² + 14t - 0.4 - 6 = 0.

Simplifying that, it becomes:

-4.9t² + 14t - 6.4 = 0.

Hmm, but working with decimals can be a bit messy, especially since the options are fractions. Maybe I should convert 4.9 into a fraction. Oh, right, 4.9 is 49/10. So, let me rewrite the equation using fractions to make it easier:

-(49/10)t² + 14t - 6.4 = 0.

Wait, 6.4 is 64/10, so maybe I can multiply every term by 10 to eliminate the denominators. Let's see:

Multiplying each term by 10:

-49t² + 140t - 64 = 0.

That looks better. Now I have a quadratic equation: -49t² + 140t -64 = 0. I can multiply both sides by -1 to make the coefficient of t² positive, which might make it easier to factor or use the quadratic formula. So:

49t² -140t +64 = 0.

Alright, now I'll use the quadratic formula. The quadratic formula is t = [140 ± sqrt( (-140)^2 - 4*49*64 )]/(2*49).

Calculating the discriminant first: D = (-140)^2 -4 *49 *64.

140 squared is 19600. Then, 4*49 is 196, and 196 *64. Let me compute that: 196 * 64. Hmm, 200*64 is 12800, minus 4*64=256, so 12800-256=12544. So D = 19600 - 12544 = 7056.

Now, sqrt(7056). Let me think. 84 squared is 7056 because 80² is 6400, 85² is 7225, so yes, 84²=7056. So sqrt(D)=84.

So now, t = [140 ±84]/(2*49) = [140 ±84]/98.

Calculating both roots:

First root: (140 +84)/98 = 224/98. Let's simplify that: both divided by 14? 224 ÷14=16, 98 ÷14=7. So 16/7.

Second root: (140 -84)/98 = 56/98. Simplifying: both divided by 14. 56 ÷14=4, 98 ÷14=7. So 4/7.

So the two times when the cannonball is at 6 meters are t=4/7 seconds and t=16/7 seconds.

Now, the cannonball is above 6 meters between these two times, so the duration is 16/7 - 4/7 = 12/7 seconds.

Wait, but let me double-check. That would be the time between when it reaches 6 meters on the way up and when it comes back down. So yes, 12/7 seconds is the time it's above 6 meters.

Looking at the options, option D is 12/7. So that should be the answer.

The cannonball is above 6 meters between t=4/7 and t=16/7 seconds, so the duration is 12/7 seconds.

Answer: D
