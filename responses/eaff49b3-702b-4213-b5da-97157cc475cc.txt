Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the answer to this insurance question. Let me read it again and think through it step by step.

The question says: During a riot, Mr. Winter's car was overturned causing $346.50 in damage. He had $50-deductible collision insurance, but no comprehensive coverage. The question is, how much will the insurance company pay him?

Hmm, I remember that collision insurance typically covers property damage or injuries to people. But wait, in this case, the insurance is only $50 deductible. So, does that mean the insurance company will only cover up to the deductible, which is $50, or the full amount?

Wait, no. No, I think collision coverage covers up to a certain amount, which in this case is $50. So the insurance company will pay the first $50 of the damage, and the rest is out of pocket for the insured.

Wait, but wait, let me think. The insurance is $50 deductible, so the insurance company will pay $50, and Mr. Winter's insurance will have to pay the rest. So the insurance company would pay $50, and Mr. Winter would have to pay $346.50 - $50 = $296.50. So the company's payment is $50.

Looking at the options, option A is $296.50, but that's the amount Mr. Winter has to pay. Wait, no. The options are how much the insurance company will pay. So the insurance company will pay $50, which is option B.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again: The insurance covers up to a certain amount. If the damage is $346.50 and the deductible is $50, then the insurance company pays $50, and the rest is out of pocket for him. So the insurance company's payment is $50.

Looking at the options, option A is $296.50, which is the amount he would have to pay. Option B is $50, which is exactly what the insurance would pay. So the correct answer should be B.

Wait, but sometimes insurance policies can have different deductibles. Let me make sure. The question says it's a $50 deductible. So yes, the insurance covers $50, so the company's payment is $50. So the answer is B.
