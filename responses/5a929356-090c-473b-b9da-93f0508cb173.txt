Okay, so I have this physics problem to solve, and I want to make sure I understand it correctly. Let me read it again.

The question is about an electric dipole consisting of two point charges. Each charge is 4.0 nC, and they're equal but opposite. They're separated by a distance of 2.0 cm. I need to find the electric field strength at the point midway between them. The options are A through J, and I need to choose the correct one.

Hmm, I remember that an electric dipole consists of two equal and opposite charges separated by some distance. The electric field at the midpoint... wait, what's the direction of the field there?

So, the setup: two charges, +4.0 nC and -4.0 nC, separated by 2 cm. The midpoint is 1 cm away from each charge. Now, the electric field due to a point charge is given by E = k*q / r², where k is Coulomb's constant (8.988×10^9 N·m²/C²), q is the charge, and r is the distance from the charge.

At the midpoint, each charge will create an electric field. But I need to consider the direction of each field. The positive charge will create an electric field pointing away from it, and the negative charge will create a field pointing towards it. Since the midpoint is between the two, the fields from each charge will point in opposite directions.

Wait, so if I'm at the midpoint, the positive charge is to one side, negative to the other. The field due to the positive charge at the midpoint would point away from it, which would be towards the negative charge. Similarly, the field due to the negative charge would point toward it, which is also towards the positive charge's side. So both fields are in the same direction? No, wait. Let me visualize this.

Imagine the two charges are placed along a line, say along the x-axis. Let's set the positive charge at x= -1 cm and the negative at x= +1 cm, so the midpoint is at x=0. The electric field at x=0 due to the positive charge (at x=-1 cm) is calculated as k*(4e-9 C)/(0.01 m)^2. The direction: since the charge is positive, the field at x=0 would point away from it, which is towards the positive x direction. Similarly, the negative charge at x=+1 cm would create a field at x=0 pointing towards it, which is also towards the positive x direction. Oh wait, both fields add up because they're in the same direction.

Wait, no. Actually, no. Let me double-check. If I'm at the midpoint between them, the positive charge at x=-1 cm: the field it creates at x=0 points away, which is towards +x. The negative charge at x=+1 cm: the field it creates at x=0 points toward itself (since negative charges attract), which is also towards -x direction. Wait, no. Wait, no. The field from the negative charge at x=0 would point towards the negative charge. So the negative charge is at x=+1 cm, so the field at x=0 would point towards it, which is in the positive x direction. So both fields point in the positive x direction. So they add together.

Wait, that can't be right. Let me think again. Let's say the positive charge is on the left, negative on the right. The field from the positive charge at the midpoint (which is to the right of the positive charge) points away from positive, towards the right. The field from the negative charge at the midpoint (which is to the left of the negative charge) points towards the negative, so also towards the right. So both fields point in the same direction, so they add.

So the total electric field at the midpoint is the sum of the two individual fields, since they're in the same direction.

But wait, wait a minute. I might be confusing the directions. Let me draw a diagram.

Positive charge (+q) at x=0, negative (-q) at x=2d. The midpoint is at x=d. The field at x=d due to +q is E1 = kq/(d²), pointing towards +x (since +q is on the left). The field at x=d due to -q is E2 = k*(-q)/(d²) but wait no, the formula for E is k*q/r², but the direction is determined by the sign. So for -q, the field at x=d would point towards the negative charge, which is to the right. So both E1 and E2 are in the same direction, right? So yes, they add.

Wait, no. Let me clarify. The formula for E is E = k*q/r² * direction. So for +q, the direction is away from it, which at x=d is to the right. For -q, the direction is towards it, which at x=d is to the right. So both E1 and E2 point to the right. So E_total = E1 + E2.

Wait, but wait. Both charges are the same magnitude, so E1 = E2 = (k*q)/(d)^2, but since d is 1 cm, which is 0.01 m.

So each E is k*4e-9 C / (0.01 m)^2.

So E_total = 2*(k*4e-9)/(0.01)^2.

Wait, is that correct? Because both charges contribute the same magnitude but same direction, so yes, adding.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me think again. If I have two equal and opposite charges arranged symmetrically, the electric field at the midpoint is actually zero. Because the field from each charge would be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. Wait, that can't be right because in this case, both fields are in the same direction.

Wait, no, I think I'm getting confused. Let me try again.

Suppose the two charges are +q and -q, separated by distance 2d. The midpoint is at d from each.

At the midpoint, the field from +q is pointing away from +q, which is towards the midpoint's position. Let's say the +q is on the left, so the field at the midpoint (which is in the middle) due to +q points to the right. The field due to -q at the midpoint points towards the -q, which is to the right as well. So both E1 and E2 are in the same direction, so E_total = E1 + E2.

Wait, that would mean E_total is twice the field from one charge. But that can't be right because I thought the field at the midpoint might be zero. So which is it?

Wait, let me think about the direction again. Let's set the positive charge at x= -d and the negative at x= +d, so the midpoint is at x=0. The field from +q at x=0 is pointing towards +x (since +q is at x=-d, so field at x=0 is away from +q, which is to the right, +x). The field from -q at x=0 is pointing towards -q, which is at x=+d, so the field at x=0 is towards +x as well. So both fields are in the same direction. So E_total = E1 + E2.

Wait, but that would make the field strength add up. So each E is (k*q)/(d²), so two of them would be 2kq/(d²).

But wait, what's the value of d here? The separation is 2 cm, so d is 1 cm, which is 0.01 m.

So q is 4.0 nC, which is 4e-9 C.

So let's compute E for each charge first.

E1 = k*q/(d²) = (8.988e9 N·m²/C²) * (4e-9 C) / (0.01 m)^2.

Calculating numerator: 8.988e9 *4e-9 = (8.988 *4) * 1e0 = 35.952.

Denominator: (0.01)^2 = 0.0001.

So E1 = 35.952 / 0.0001 = 359520 V/m.

Since E_total is twice that, because both fields add up, E_total = 2 * 359520 = 719040 V/m.

Wait, but that's 7.1904e5 V/m, which is approximately 7.2 × 10^5 V/m. Looking at the options, option C is 7.2 × 10^5 V/m. So that would be the answer.

But wait, I thought earlier that the field at the midpoint is zero. Where did I go wrong? Oh, wait, no. I think I might have confused it with the electric potential. The potential at the midpoint of a dipole is actually zero, because the potentials from each charge cancel out. But the electric field is not zero there because the fields add up.

Wait, no, wait again. No, that's not correct. Let me think carefully.

In an electric dipole, the potential at the midpoint is indeed zero because the potential from each charge is equal in magnitude but opposite in sign. But the electric field is not zero. Wait, no, I think I'm getting this mixed up.

Wait, no. Let me correct this. The electric field at the midpoint of a dipole is not zero. Let me think again.

Wait, in an electric dipole, the field at the midpoint is maximum. Wait, no, wait: the dipole field varies with position. The field along the axis of the dipole has a certain behavior, but the midpoint is a special point.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing it with the case where the dipole is considered as two point charges, and the midpoint is between them. So let me think again.

Each charge creates a field at the midpoint. Since the charges are opposite, each field is in the same direction, so they add. So the total field is twice the field from one charge.

Wait, but that's what I calculated earlier, leading to option C.

But wait, I think I made a mistake in the direction. Let me confirm again.

Positive charge on the left, negative on the right. At the midpoint, the field from the positive charge points to the right. The field from the negative charge points to the left. Oh wait, no. Because the negative charge's field points toward itself. So if the negative charge is on the right, the field at the midpoint points to the right. Because the midpoint is to the left of the negative charge, so the field points towards the negative charge, which is to the right.

Wait no, the midpoint is exactly between the two charges. So for the negative charge, the field at the midpoint points towards it, which is to the right. For the positive charge, the field points away, which is to the right. So both fields are to the right, adding up. So the total field is 2*(kq/d²).

So now, let's compute that.

k = 8.988e9 N·m²/C²,

q = 4.0 nC = 4.0e-9 C,

d = 1 cm = 0.01 m.

E_single = (8.988e9) * (4e-9) / (0.01)^2.

Calculating numerator: 8.988e9 *4e-9 = (8.988 *4) * 1e0 = 35.952.

Denominator: (0.01)^2 = 0.0001.

So E_single = 35.952 / 0.0001 = 359520 V/m.

E_total = 2 * 359520 = 719040 V/m, which is 7.1904e5 V/m, approximately 7.2e5 V/m.

Looking at the options, option C is 7.2 × 10^5 V/m, so that's the answer.

But wait, I'm a bit confused because I remember that the electric field at the midpoint of a dipole is not zero but twice that of a single charge. But let me make sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the direction. Wait, let me think: if the midpoint is exactly between two equal and opposite charges, then the electric fields from each charge at that point are in opposite directions, so they would cancel each other out. Wait, that can't be. Because the positive charge's field points to the right, and the negative's points to the left, then they would cancel.

Wait, no, wait again. No, I think I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, the positive charge is at position x=-d, the negative at x=+d. Midpoint at x=0.

The electric field at x=0 due to +q is pointing away from +q, which is towards +x (to the right). The electric field at x=0 due to -q is pointing towards -q, which is at x=+d, so the field is also towards +x (to the right). So both fields are in the same direction.

So E_total = E1 + E2 = 2*(kq/(d²)).

Wait, but that would make the field non-zero. So that's correct.

Wait, but I thought that the electric field at the midpoint is zero because the fields cancel. Hmm, maybe I was confusing it with the potential. The potential at the midpoint is zero, but the electric field isn't.

Wait, potential is a scalar quantity. So at the midpoint, the potential due to +q is kq/d, and due to -q is -kq/d. They add up to zero.

But electric field is a vector. Each field at the midpoint is kq/(d²) in the same direction, so they add.

So E_total is 2*(kq/(d²)).

So that brings me back to the calculation: 7.2e5 V/m, which is option C.

But wait, looking back at the options, option D is zero. So why would that be an option? Perhaps I'm making a mistake in the direction.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the direction. Let me think again.

If the positive charge is on the left, negative on the right. The midpoint is in between.

The field from the positive charge at the midpoint is towards the right (since it's positive, field lines go away from it, so at midpoint, to the right).

The field from the negative charge at the midpoint is towards the negative charge, which is on the right, so that's also to the right.

So both fields are in the same direction, so they add up.

So E_total = 2*(kq/(d²)).

So calculation: k=8.988e9, q=4e-9 C, d=0.01 m.

So E_single = (8.988e9)(4e-9)/(0.01)^2.

Calculate numerator: 8.988e9 *4e-9 = (8.988 *4) *1e0 = 35.952.

Denominator: 0.01^2 = 0.0001.

So E_single = 35.952 / 0.0001 = 359520 V/m.

E_total = 2 * 359520 = 719040 V/m, which is 7.19e5 V/m. Rounded to two significant figures, it's 7.2e5 V/m, which matches option C.

Wait, but the options list C as 7.2e5 V/m, which is correct.

So the answer should be option C.
</think>

The problem involves an electric dipole consisting of two equal and opposite point charges, each with a magnitude of 4.0 nC, separated by a distance of 2.0 cm. The goal is to determine the electric field strength at the midpoint between the charges.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Electric Field from a Point Charge**: The electric field due to a point charge is given by:
   \[
   E = \frac{kq}{r^2}
   \]
   where \(k = 8.988 \times 10^9 \, \text{N·m}^2/\text{C}^2\), \(q\) is the charge, and \(r\) is the distance from the charge.

2. **Setup**: The two charges are \(+4.0 \, \text{nC}\) and \(-4.0 \, \text{nC}\), separated by \(2.0 \, \text{cm}\). The midpoint is \(1.0 \, \text{cm}\) (or \(0.01 \, \text{m}\)) from each charge.

3. **Direction of Electric Fields**:
   - The field due to the positive charge at the midpoint points away from it, i.e., to the right.
   - The field due to the negative charge at the midpoint points toward it, i.e., also to the right.
   - Since both fields point in the same direction, they add up.

4. **Electric Field Calculation**:
   - For one charge:
     \[
     E_{\text{single}} = \frac{(8.988 \times 10^9)(4.0 \times 10^{-9})}{(0.01)^2} = 359,520 \, \text{V/m}
     \]
   - Total field at the midpoint:
     \[
     E_{\text{total}} = 2 \times E_{\text{single}} = 2 \times 359,520 = 719,040 \, \text{V/m} \approx 7.2 \times 10^5 \, \text{V/m}
     \]

5. **Conclusion**: The electric field at the midpoint is not zero because the fields from both charges add up in the same direction. The calculated value matches option C.
