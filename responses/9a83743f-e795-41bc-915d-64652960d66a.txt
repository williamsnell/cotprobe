Okay, so I have this problem about a spring-mass-damper system, and I need to find the mass m that maximizes the amplitude of the steady-state response when an external force is applied. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to work through it step by step.

First, the problem states that the spring is stretched 6 inches by a mass of 8 pounds. Wait, but mass is usually in slugs in the English system, right? Because weight is in pounds. So maybe I should convert the weight to mass. Oh, right, weight W equals mass m times gravity g. So m = W/g. I think g is 32 ft/s², so m = 8 lb / 32 ft/s² = 0.25 slugs. Wait no, wait, the initial setup might not require that because they later replace the mass with m, so probably the initial 8 lb is the weight, and the spring is stretched 6 inches (which is 0.5 ft) by that weight. So using Hooke's law, F = kx. So k = F/x. F here is the weight, which is 8 lb, and x is 0.5 ft. So k = 8 / 0.5 = 16 lb/ft. Got that, k is 16.

Next, the system has a damping constant of 0.25 lb·s/ft. So the damping coefficient c is 0.25. The external force is 4 cos(2t) lb. We're to replace the initial mass (which is 0.25 slugs, as calculated) with a mass m, and find the m that maximizes the amplitude of the steady-state response.

I remember that the amplitude of the steady-state response for a forced oscillator is given by a certain formula involving the damping ratio and the frequency of the force. The formula is something like (F0 / k) divided by sqrt((1 - (ωn²/ω)^2)^2 + (2ζωn/ω)^2), where ζ is the damping ratio, ωn is the natural frequency, and ω is the forcing frequency.

Wait, let me get this straight. The amplitude M is given by M = (F0 / k) / sqrt( (1 - (ωn²/ω²))² + (2ζ ωn ω)^2 ). Wait, no, maybe I have the terms a bit mixed up. Let's think. The standard formula is M = (F0 / k) / sqrt( (ωn² - ω²)^2 + (2ζ ωn ω)^2 ). Because the denominator is the square of the imaginary part plus the real part squared, which is the magnitude squared of the denominator in the transfer function.

Wait, no, actually, I think the formula is M = (F0 / (k)) * 1 / sqrt( (ωn² - ω²)^2 + (2ζ ωn ω)^2 ). So that's the amplitude.

But wait, in this case, the damping ratio ζ is c/(2√(km)). So ζ depends on m because the mass is variable here. Our goal is to find m that maximizes M.

So, M is proportional to 1 over the square root of ( (ωn² - ω²)^2 + (2ζ ωn ω)^2 ). To maximize M, we need to minimize the denominator. So the denominator is (ωn² - ω²)^2 + (2ζ ωn ω)^2.

But wait, let's find ωn. The natural frequency ωn is sqrt(k/m). So ωn = sqrt(k/m). Let me compute k; earlier I found k=16 lb/ft.

The external force is 4 cos(2t), so the forcing frequency ω is 2 rad/s.

So, let's write the denominator in terms of m.

Denominator D = (k/m - ω²)^2 + (2ζ ωn ω)^2.

But since ζ = c/(2√(k m)) ), so 2ζ ωn = (c/(2√(k m))) ) * 2 sqrt(k/m) ) = (c/(√(k m))) * sqrt(k/m) ) = c/(m).

Wait, let me check that again. 2ζ ωn = 2*(c/(2√(k m))) ) * sqrt(k/m) ) = (c/(√(k m))) ) * sqrt(k/m) ) = c/(m). So 2ζ ωn = c/m.

So, the second term in the denominator becomes (c/m * ω)^2.

So, D = (k/m - ω²)^2 + (c ω / m )^2.

Substituting the known values: k=16, c=0.25, ω=2.

So D = (16/m - 2²)^2 + (0.25 * 2 / m )^2.

Simplify:

16/m - 4 is (16 -4m)/m, so squared is (16-4m)^2 / m².

The second term is (0.5/m)^2 = 0.25/m².

So D = [ (16 -4m)^2 + 0.25 ] / m².

So D = [ (256 - 128m + 16m²) + 0.25 ] / m² = (16m² -128m +256.25 ) / m².

So the denominator in M is sqrt(D), so M is proportional to 1/sqrt(D), which is m / sqrt(16m² -128m +256.25).

To maximize M, we need to minimize D, which is (16m² -128m +256.25)/m².

Alternatively, since D is proportional to (16m² -128m +256.25)/m², we can consider the expression inside as a function f(m) = 16m² -128m +256.25.

We can find the minimum of f(m) with respect to m.

Since f(m) is a quadratic in m, it opens upwards (since the coefficient of m² is positive), so the minimum occurs at m = -b/(2a) where a=16, b=-128.

So m = 128/(2*16) = 128/32 = 4.

Wait, that's 4 slugs. So the minimum of f(m) occurs at m=4. So the denominator D is minimized at m=4, which would make M maximized.

So the mass m that maximizes the amplitude is 4 slugs. Looking at the options, F is 4 slugs.

The problem involves finding the mass \( m \) that maximizes the amplitude of the steady-state response for a spring-mass-damper system under an external force. The key steps are:

1. **Determine the spring constant \( k \):**  
   Using Hooke's law, \( F = kx \), where \( F = 8 \, \text{lb} \) and \( x = 6 \, \text{in} = 0.5 \, \text{ft} \).  
   \( k = \frac{F}{x} = \frac{8}{0.5} = 16 \, \text{lb/ft} \).

2. **Express the amplitude formula:**  
   The amplitude \( M \) is given by:  
   \[
   M = \frac{F_0 / k}{\sqrt{(1 - (\omega_n^2 / \omega^2))^2 + (2 \zeta \omega_n \omega)^2}}
   \]  
   where \( \omega_n = \sqrt{k/m} \), \( \zeta = \frac{c}{2 \sqrt{k m}} \), \( c = 0.25 \, \text{lb·s/ft} \), and \( F_0 = 4 \, \text{lb} \), \( \omega = 2 \, \text{rad/s} \).

3. **Simplify the denominator:**  
   Substituting \( \zeta \) and \( \omega_n \), the denominator becomes:  
   \[
   D = \frac{(16/m - 4)^2 + (0.25 \cdot 2 / m)^2}{m^2}
   \]  
   Simplifying further:  
   \[
   D = \frac{(16 - 4m)^2 + 0.25}{m^2}
   \]

4. **Minimize the denominator \( D \):**  
   The expression inside \( D \) is a quadratic function of \( m \):  
   \[
   f(m) = 16m^2 - 128m + 256.25
   \]  
   The minimum of \( f(m) \) occurs at \( m = \frac{128}{2 \cdot 16} = 4 \, \text{slugs} \).

Thus, the mass \( m \) that maximizes the amplitude is **4 slugs**.
