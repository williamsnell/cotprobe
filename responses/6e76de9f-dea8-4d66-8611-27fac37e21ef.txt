Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about solid angles. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question is: The solid angle subtended by an area of 2400 cm² on the surface of a sphere of diameter 1.2 m is... and then there are several options given. I need to figure out which one is correct.

First, I remember that a solid angle is a measure of how large an object appears to an observer from a certain point. In the case of a sphere, the solid angle depends on the area of the surface and the radius of the sphere.

Wait, the formula for solid angle Ω is something like Ω = A / r², right? Because I think solid angle is the area divided by the square of the radius. But wait, that's when the area is a spherical cap, I think. Or maybe it's when the area is a differential element. Hmm, I need to be careful here.

Wait, actually, solid angle can be calculated using the formula Ω = A / r², where A is the area of the surface on the sphere, and r is the radius of the sphere. But I'm not entirely sure if that's the correct formula. Maybe I should think about it more carefully.

Alternatively, I remember that the solid angle in steradians (the SI unit) is given by the formula Ω = (A) / r², but only when the area is a part of a sphere. So in this case, the area of 2400 cm² is a section of the sphere's surface. So yes, I think that formula applies here.

Alright, so let me get the values right. The diameter of the sphere is given as 1.2 meters. So the radius r would be half of that, which is 0.6 meters. Let me convert that to centimeters because the area is given in cm². Since 1 meter is 100 cm, 0.6 meters is 60 cm. So r = 60 cm.

The area A is 2400 cm². So plugging into the formula Ω = A / r², I get Ω = 2400 cm² / (60 cm)².

Calculating the denominator first: 60 squared is 3600 cm². So Ω = 2400 / 3600. Let me do that division. 2400 divided by 3600 is the same as 2/3, because 2400 is two-thirds of 3600. So Ω = 2/3 steradians.

Wait, but wait a second. The formula I used assumes that the area is a spherical cap, right? Because the solid angle formula applies to a spherical surface. So in this problem, the area is part of the sphere's surface, so the formula should be applicable.

Let me check the units again. The area is in cm², and the radius is in cm, so when I square the radius, the units are cm², and the area is cm², so the units cancel out, leaving a dimensionless quantity, which is what solid angle is. So that's correct.

So Ω = 2/3 steradians. Looking at the options, option G is 2/3, so that must be the correct answer.

The solid angle Ω is calculated using the formula Ω = A / r². Given the area A = 2400 cm² and the sphere's radius r = 0.6 m = 60 cm, we find Ω = 2400 / (60)² = 2400 / 3600 = 2/3 steradians. 

Answer: G
