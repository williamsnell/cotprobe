Question:

Jacob and Sons Plumbing bought a forklift for $10,000. The forklift is expected to last 5 years, and to have a residual value of $3,000. Jacob wishes to use the straight line depreciation method, while his sons wish to use the sum-of-the-years'-digits method. What will the difference in the depreciation allowances be for the third year?

Options:

A: $600
B: zero
C: $500
D: $150
E: $400
F: $200
G: $250
H: $300
I: $350
J: $100

Okay, so I've got this question about depreciation methods, and I need to figure out the difference in the depreciation allowances for the third year between straight line and sum-of-the-years'-digits methods. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the company bought a forklift for $10,000. It's expected to last 5 years, and the residual value is $3,000. So, the depreciable amount is the cost minus the residual value. That would be $10,000 minus $3,000, which equals $7,000. This $7,000 is the total amount that will be depreciated over the 5 years.

Now, let's look at the straight line method first. Straight line is the simplest; you take the depreciable amount and divide it by the useful life. So, $7,000 divided by 5 years is $1,400 per year. That means each year, including the third year, depreciation is $1,400.

Next, the sum-of-the-years'-digits method. I remember this method is an accelerated depreciation method, so more of the cost is expensed in the earlier years. The way it works is by calculating a numerator for each year which is (remaining years of service). So for a 5-year asset, the digits would be 5,4,3,2,1. Summing these gives 15.

The depreciable amount is still $7,000. So each year's depreciation is calculated as (remaining years) divided by the sum (15) multiplied by the depreciable amount.

Let me calculate the depreciation for each year using SYD.

Year 1: 5/15 *7000 = (5*7000)/15 = 35,000/15 ≈ $2,333.33
Year 2: 4/15 *7000 = 28,000/15 ≈ $1,866.67
Year 3: 3/15 *7000 = 21,000/15 = $1,400
Year 4: 2/15 *7000 ≈ $933.33
Year 5: 1/15 *7000 ≈ $466.67

Wait a minute, so in the third year, the depreciation using SYD is $1,400. That's the same as the straight line method. So the depreciation for the third year under both methods is $1,400 each. Therefore, the difference would be zero.

Wait, but let me double-check. Did I make a mistake? Because I thought SYD gives higher depreciation in the earlier years, but in the third year, it's the same as straight line.

Let me recalculate the third year's SYD depreciation. The formula is (remaining years) which in year 3 would be 3 (since it's the third year of a 5-year asset). So (3/15)*7000 = 3*466.6667 = $1,400. Yes, that's correct.

So both methods give $1,400 in the third year. Therefore, the difference is zero. So the answer should be option B: zero.

The depreciation for the third year under both methods is $1,400, so the difference is zero.

Answer: B
