Okay, so I have this question about accounting terms, and I need to figure out what the difference between assets and liabilities is called. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that in accounting, there's something called the accounting equation, which is Assets = Liabilities + Equity. So, if I rearrange that, the difference between assets and liabilities would be Equity. Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me make sure.

Alternatively, I think the term might be Net Worth. Because sometimes I've heard Net Worth referred to as the value of a company, which is assets minus liabilities. So is Net Worth the same as Equity? Or are they different?

Wait, no, in the equation, Equity is equal to Assets minus Liabilities. So the difference between assets and liabilities is Equity. But Net Worth is another term for the same thing, right? So maybe both D and J could be correct, but looking at the options, D is Net Worth and J is equity.

Wait, the question is asking what the difference is called. So the difference between assets and liabilities is Equity, which is also known as Net Worth. So both D and J could be correct, but looking at the options, I need to see which one is the direct term.

Wait, let me double-check. In the accounting equation, Assets = Liabilities + Equity. So, rearranged, Equity = Assets - Liabilities. So the difference is Equity. But Net Worth is another term for the same thing, especially when referring to a company's value. So maybe the answer is J: equity.

Wait, but some people might refer to it as Net Worth. So is the question asking for the term used in accounting? Or is it more about the direct difference?

Looking at the options, D is Net Worth and J is equity. So both are correct, but the question is about the difference between assets and liabilities. So the direct term would be equity, which is J. Net Worth is a broader term that can include other aspects, but in accounting, the immediate difference is equity.

So I think the answer is J: equity.

The difference between assets and liabilities is called equity. In the accounting equation, Assets = Liabilities + Equity, which means Equity = Assets - Liabilities. While Net Worth is another term often used interchangeably with equity, the direct term for the difference is equity.
