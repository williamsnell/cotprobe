Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let me read it again: "In the absence of air resistance, a ball of mass m is tossed upward to reach a height of 20 m. At the 10-m position, halfway up, the net force on the ball is..." and then there are several options to choose from.

Hmm, right. So the ball is thrown straight up, and we're looking at the net force acting on it when it's at 10 meters. Since air resistance isn't a factor, the only force involved should be gravity, right? Because without air resistance, there's no other force like drag acting on it.

Wait, but I remember that when an object is moving, the net force is mass times acceleration (F=ma). So in this case, the acceleration would be due to gravity. Oh, right! The acceleration is g, which is approximately 9.8 m/sÂ² downward. But wait, the question is about the net force. So the net force should be mass times acceleration due to gravity.

Let me think about this again. At any point in the ball's motion after it's been thrown upward, the only force acting on it is gravity pulling it down. So at 10 meters, which is halfway up, the net force should just be mg downward, right?

But wait, wait a second. The ball is moving upward when it's at 10 meters. Does that affect the net force? No, because net force depends on acceleration, not velocity. So even though it's moving upward, the acceleration is still -g (negative because it's downward). So F_net = m * a = m * (-g). The magnitude is mg, so the net force is mg downward.

So looking at the options, option I is mg. That should be the correct answer. Let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Oh, wait, the question says "net force on the ball." Since we're neglecting air resistance, the only force is gravity. So yeah, mg is the net force. No other forces are acting on it, so the answer must be I.

The only force acting on the ball in the absence of air resistance is gravity, which is mg downward. Therefore, the net force at 10 meters is mg.
