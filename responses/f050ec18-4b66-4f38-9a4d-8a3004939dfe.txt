Question:

A shopper suffered injuries to her back and legs when she slipped on a loose piece of carpeting in a hallway connecting a department store and a cafeteria. The shopper brought suit against the owner of the entire building. The owner claimed that since he leased the cafeteria, he no longer retained any control over the connecting hallway. If the shopper offers into evidence the fact that two days after the accident, the owner had the hallway carpet re-laid, the court should rule that the evidence is

Options:

A: admissible, because it shows the owner's responsibility for maintaining safe conditions.
B: inadmissible, because the owner's actions after the accident do not pertain to the conditions at the time of the accident.
C: inadmissible, because it is evidence of a good deed by the owner after the accident.
D: inadmissible, because it is speculation about the owner's control over the hallway.
E: admissible, because it proves the owner had the power to make changes in the hallway.
F: admissible, because it shows that the owner retained ownership and control.
G: admissible, because it demonstrates the owner's negligence in not maintaining the hallway previously.
H: admissible, because it is relevant to the issue of the owner's knowledge of the unsafe condition.
I: inadmissible, because the evidence is irrelevant to the accident.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this legal question about evidence admissibility. Let me read through the scenario again. 

A shopper slipped on loose carpeting in a hallway connecting a department store and a cafeteria. She sued the building owner, who claims he leased the cafeteria and no longer has control over the hallway. The shopper is trying to admit evidence that two days after the accident, the owner had the hallway carpet re-laid.

I remember that in tort law, especially premises liability, the question often revolves around whether the defendant had control or ownership of the area where the injury occurred. If the owner leased the cafeteria but still had control over the hallway, maybe he's liable.

The key here is the evidence of the owner re-laying the carpet after the accident. I think about whether this action is admissible. The options suggest different reasons for admissibility or inadmissibility.

Option A says it's admissible because it shows the owner's responsibility. That sounds plausible because if he took action afterward, maybe he had control.

Option B says it's inadmissible because the actions after the accident don't pertain to the time of the accident. That makes sense too because actions after the fact usually aren't used to establish liability for the condition at the time.

Option E suggests it's admissible because it proves power to make changes. Maybe so, but I'm not sure if that's the main issue here.

Option F says it's about ownership and control. If he could make changes, like re-laying the carpet, that might show he had control, making him liable.

Option H says it's relevant to knowledge of unsafe conditions. If he fixed it after, maybe he knew about the issue, but I'm not sure if that's the case.

Wait, but the owner claims he no longer had control. So the shopper is trying to prove he did have control. If he took action afterward, maybe that shows he had authority over the area. But is this evidence about his actions after the accident relevant to his control at the time?

I think the general rule is that subsequent remedial measures are inadmissible to prove negligence or liability. They can be used for other purposes, like showing repair methods, but not to prove the condition at the time. So the fact that he fixed it afterward doesn't necessarily mean he was responsible for maintaining it before.

So the correct ruling would be that the evidence is inadmissible because it's about actions after the accident, which don't pertain to the condition at the time. That would align with option B.

But wait, another angle: sometimes subsequent actions can show ownership or control. If he had the hallway carpet replaced, does that indicate he had control? Maybe, but I think that's a stretch. The main point is that subsequent actions are not for establishing liability for the prior condition.

Therefore, the court should rule the evidence inadmissible because it doesn't pertain to the condition at the time of the accident. So the answer would be option B.

The evidence of the owner re-laying the carpet two days after the accident is inadmissible because it concerns actions taken after the incident and does not pertain to the conditions at the time of the accident. 

Answer: B
