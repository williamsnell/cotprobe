Question:

In 1989 scientists from Norway discovered that there are far more viruses in oceans lakes, and streams than previously believed. How many viruses did they find that a milliliter of natural water might contain?

Options:

A: up to 5000000
B: up to 2500000
C: up to 500000000
D: up to 1000000000
E: up to 250000000
F: up to 50000
G: up to 500
H: up to 25000
I: up to 250
J: up to 7500000

Okay, so I need to figure out the correct answer to this question about how many viruses are in a milliliter of natural water according to the 1989 discovery by Norwegian scientists. I remember that before this, it was thought that there weren't that many viruses in water, but the study changed that perception.

Let me think about what I know. I've heard that the ocean and other water bodies have a high concentration of viruses, but I'm not exactly sure of the numbers. The options given are A through J, with numbers ranging from just a few hundred up to billions. 

Wait, I think the number was in the millions. So the options like F, G, H, I, which are much lower, might not be right. Those are in the thousands or hundreds, which seems too low for what I've heard. The higher numbers like A, B, C, D, E, J are in the millions to billions.

I remember reading something about a high number, but I'm not sure if it's 5 million, 25 million, 50 million, or more. Let me try to recall. I think the study found that there are about 10^6 to 10^8 viruses per liter in marine water. Wait, but the question is per milliliter, not per liter. Oh, right, because 1 liter is 1000 milliliters. So if it's 10^6 per liter, that's 1,000,000 per liter, which would be 1,000 per milliliter. But that seems too low, so maybe I'm mixing up the numbers.

Wait, no, perhaps I got it wrong. I think the numbers were much higher. Maybe it's up to 10^7 per milliliter? That would be 10 million per mL. Let me check the options. Option A is 5,000,000, which is 5 million. Option B is 2.5 million. Option J is 7.5 million. Option E is 250 million, which is 250,000,000, and that seems too high. Option C is 500 million, D is 1 billion, which is 1,000 million. 

I think the correct number was around 5 million per mL, so option A. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because another thought comes to mind. I recall that a study found about 10^6 to 10^8 viruses per liter, which translates to 1,000 to 100,000 per mL. Hmm, that doesn't align with the options given. Maybe I'm miscalculating.

Wait, perhaps the study found up to 5 million per mL. Let me think again. If it's 5 million, that's option A. Alternatively, I've heard that some sources say up to 10 million per mL, but that's not one of the options. The closest is J at 7.5 million. Alternatively, maybe the correct number is 5 million. 

Alternatively, perhaps the study found up to 50 million per mL, which would be option J, but I'm not sure. Wait, I think the actual figure I remember is around 5 million per mL, so option A. Or maybe it's higher. Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to think of another approach.

I know that prior to this study, it was believed that there were fewer viruses in water, but the discovery showed a much higher concentration. So the number must be significantly higher than what was previously thought. If the options include up to 5 million, 25 million, 500 million, etc., I think the correct answer is A: up to 5,000,000. Because I remember reading that in a milliliter, there could be millions of viruses. So I'll go with A.

The correct answer is A: up to 5,000,000.
