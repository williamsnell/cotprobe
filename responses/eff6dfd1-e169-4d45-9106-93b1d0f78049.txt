Okay, so I have this question about whether aggressiveness is instinctual, and I need to choose the correct option from A to J. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the question is asking about the general contentions regarding whether aggressiveness is instinctual. I know that instinctual behaviors are those that are innate, not learned, and are typically present in all members of a species. Examples include things like a bird building a nest or a cat pouncing on prey.

Now, looking at the options:

A: Aggressiveness is determined by genetic inheritance alone. So this is saying it's all genetics, no environment. But I remember that behavior is usually a mix of both nature and nurture. So maybe this is too extreme.

B: Aggressiveness has no instinctual basis in man. That would mean it's all learned, but I think some argue that aggression has an evolutionary basis, so this might not be right.

C: Aggressiveness is purely instinctual. Again, this seems too absolute. I don't think anything is purely instinctual because environment plays a role too.

D: Aggressiveness is a response only to immediate environmental stimuli. That sounds like it's saying it's all learned or a reaction to the here and now, but I think there's more to it than that.

E: Aggressiveness is an exclusively human trait. No, animals show aggressive behavior too, like in the wild for territory or mating.

F: Aggressiveness can be completely eradicated through education. That seems unlikely. Education can influence behavior, but complete eradication? Probably not, since there's likely an instinctual component.

G: Aggressiveness is a complex interaction between innate tendencies and learned responses. This makes sense because most behaviors are a mix of both. Innate factors influence it, but environment and learning shape how it's expressed.

H: Aggressiveness is solely based on learned responses. Similar to option A, this is too absolute. It ignores the genetic and evolutionary aspects.

I: Aggressiveness is a seasonal behavior. I don't think that's the case. Seasonal behaviors are more like migration or hibernation, not something like aggression which can occur year-round.

J: Aggressiveness emerges only in the absence of societal structures. That seems backwards. Societies have rules against aggression, but I think people can be aggressive even in structured societies, so this might not be correct.

So, putting it together, the correct answer should be G because it acknowledges both innate and learned aspects. It's a balanced view, which aligns with what I know about human behavior.

The correct answer is G: Aggressiveness is a complex interaction between innate tendencies and learned responses.

Answer: G
