Question:

A researcher tests the problem solving skills of twenty 10-year-old, twenty 20-year-old, and twenty 30-year-old participants for a study on age and problem solving. What research method is this researcher using?

Options:

A: survey
B: experimental
C: case study
D: stage
E: correlation
F: cross-sectional
G: longitudinal
H: sequential
I: ethnographic
J: developmental

Okay, so I've got this question about research methods, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let me read it again.

The question says a researcher tested the problem-solving skills of three groups: twenty 10-year-olds, twenty 20-year-olds, and twenty 30-year-olds. The study is about age and problem-solving. I need to pick the research method used from the options given.

Hmm, the options are A to J, and I remember some of these from my psychology class. Let's list them out:

A: survey
B: experimental
C: case study
D: stage
E: correlation
F: cross-sectional
G: longitudinal
H: sequential
I: ethnographic
J: developmental

Wait, I think the question is about the design of the study. So, the researcher is comparing three age groups at the same time, right? They're testing each group once, not following them over time.

If they were following the same group over years, that would be longitudinal. But here, it's three different groups, each representing different age points. So that sounds like a cross-sectional study. Cross-sectional means looking at different groups at one point in time.

Let me think about the other options. Experimental usually involves manipulating variables and control groups, which doesn't seem to be the case here. It's more of an observational study comparing groups. Correlation would be looking for a relationship between variables, but this is more about comparing groups on a test.

Case study is in-depth on a single case, not groups. Ethnographic is about cultural settings, which isn't indicated here. Sequential might involve phases, but I'm not sure how that applies. Developmental could relate to age, but I think cross-sectional is more specific here.

So, the method is cross-sectional because it's comparing different age groups at one time.

The researcher is comparing three age groups (10, 20, and 30 years old) at the same time to assess their problem-solving skills. This approach involves examining different groups at one point in time, which fits the definition of a cross-sectional study. 

Answer: F
