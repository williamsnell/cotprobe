Okay, so I have this question about finding the mode or modes of a sample. The sample given is 6, 7, 7, 3, 8, 5, 3, 9. The options are from A to J, and I need to figure out which one is correct.

First, I remember that the mode is the number that appears most frequently in a data set. If no number repeats, then there's no mode. If two numbers have the same highest frequency, then there are two modes, making it bimodal. 

Let me list out the numbers and count how many times each appears. 

Starting with 6: I see it once. Then 7 appears twice. Next, 3 appears twice as well. 8 is once, 5 is once, and 9 is once. 

So, the counts are:
- 3: 2 times
- 7: 2 times
- All others: 1 time each.

Since both 3 and 7 appear twice, which is more than any other number, they are both modes. That means the data set is bimodal, with modes 3 and 7.

Now looking at the options, option I is "3 and 7," which matches what I found. Let me check the other options to make sure I'm not missing anything. 

Option A says no mode, but that's not true because 3 and 7 both appear more than once. Option C says 7 only, but 3 also appears twice, so that's incorrect. Option I is the correct choice.

The mode is the number that appears most frequently. Here, both 3 and 7 appear twice, making them the modes.

Answer: I
