Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about lithic technology. The question is asking for the name of the lithic technology found in the Arctic that includes wedge-shaped cores, micro-blades, bifacial knives, and burins. The options are A through J, each representing a different complex.

First, I need to recall what each of these complexes is known for. I remember that lithic technologies are categorized based on the stone tools and methods used by prehistoric peoples. Let me go through each option one by one.

Starting with option A: Ahrensburg Complex. I think this is associated with the Ahrensburgian culture, which dates back to the Upper Paleolithic in Europe. They were known for their stone tools, possibly including points and blades, but I'm not sure if they were specifically in the Arctic or used micro-blades extensively.

Option B: Solutrean Complex. The Solutreans were a prehistoric culture in the Iberian Peninsula, known for their advanced stone tool techniques, including the production of thin, leaf-shaped points. They were not in the Arctic, so probably not this one.

Option C: Aurignacian Complex. The Aurignacian is associated with the earliest modern humans in Europe, known for their blade technology and possibly the production of tools like scrapers and points. But again, I don't think this is specific to the Arctic.

Option D: Nenana Complex. Nenana is a term I've heard in the context of Alaska. I believe the Nenana Complex refers to stone tools found in the interior of Alaska, possibly dating back to the late Pleistocene. They might have used wedge-shaped cores and micro-blades, which fits part of the question. I think this could be the right answer.

Option E: Gravettian Complex. The Gravettians were another Upper Paleolithic culture in Europe, known for their Venus figurines and stone tools, but again, not particularly linked to the Arctic regions.

Option F: Clovis Complex. The Clovis culture is famous for their large projectile points in North America, especially during the Paleoindian period. They were more associated with big game hunting and are found in various regions, including parts of the US, but I don't think they're specifically linked to the Arctic with the tools mentioned.

Option G: Denali Complex. Denali is a mountain in Alaska, but I'm not sure if there's a lithic complex named after it. It doesn't ring a bell as a specific archaeological term related to tools.

Option H: Mousterian Complex. The Mousterian is associated with the Neanderthals, found across Europe and the Near East. They used tools like scrapers, points, and stone cores, but again, not specific to the Arctic.

Option I: Magdalenian Complex. This is another Upper Paleolithic culture, known for their art and tools, primarily in Europe. They were into hunting and produced tools like harpoons and fish hooks, but not specifically the Arctic.

Option J: Folsom Complex. The Folsom culture is known for their distinctive projectile points in the Great Plains of North America. They were contemporaries with the Clovis culture but not in the Arctic.

So, putting this together, the question is about an Arctic lithic technology. The Nenana Complex (D) is associated with Alaska, which is in the Arctic. Their tools include wedge-shaped cores, which are used to produce micro-blades. Additionally, they made bifacial knives and burins, which are multi-functional tools. This fits the description given in the question.

I think the answer is D: Nenana Complex.

The correct answer is the Nenana Complex, which is associated with the Arctic region and features the tools described.

Answer: D
