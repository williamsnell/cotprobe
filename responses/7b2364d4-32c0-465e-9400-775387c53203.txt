Alright, so I have this question about a sporting event held annually on Memorial Day weekend. The options are A through J, and I need to figure out which one is correct. Let me think through each option one by one.

First, I remember that Memorial Day is a US holiday, typically observed on the last Monday in May. It's a day to remember those who died in military service. Some big events happen around that time, but I'm not sure which sport it is.

Looking at the options:

A: FIFA World Cup. I think the World Cup is a major international soccer tournament, but I don't recall it happening every year on Memorial Day. I believe it's held every four years, during the summer.

B: Stanley Cup Finals. That's the NHL's championship, part of the ice hockey season. From what I remember, the Stanley Cup usually happens in the late spring or early summer, but I'm not certain if it's specifically on Memorial Day weekend.

C: Wimbledon. That's the tennis grand slam event held in London. I know it's in late June or early July, not in May, so probably not this one.

D: World Series. That's Major League Baseball's championship. I think the World Series is usually in late September or early October, so not around Memorial Day.

E: Iditarod. That's the dog sled race in Alaska, right? It's held in March, so not in May.

F: Daytona 500. That's a big NASCAR event, the first race of the season. I'm pretty sure it's held in February, so not Memorial Day.

G: Super Bowl. That's the NFL championship, usually held in early February, so definitely not in May.

H: The Masters. That's the famous golf tournament, part of the PGA Tour. I think it's held in April, not May.

I: Kentucky Derby. Oh, wait! The Kentucky Derby is a horse racing event, and I remember hearing it's held on the first Saturday in May. Memorial Day is typically around the end of May, so the Kentucky Derby is earlier than that.

J: Indianapolis 500. That's the IndyCar race, a big event. I think it's held in May, but I'm not sure of the exact date. Wait, I think it's on the Sunday before Memorial Day weekend, so maybe that's it.

Wait, so if Memorial Day is on a Monday, the Indy 500 is the weekend before. So the event is the Sunday before Memorial Day. That would make the Indy 500 the one held annually on that weekend. Alternatively, the Kentucky Derby is on the first Saturday in May, which could be a few weeks earlier.

So, considering that, the correct answer is probably J: Indianapolis 500. Because it's traditionally held on the Sunday before Memorial Day. I'm pretty sure the Kentucky Derby is earlier, so it doesn't coincide with Memorial Day weekend itself. The Indy 500 is the one that's part of the Memorial Day weekend activities.

The correct answer is J: Indianapolis 500, as it is traditionally held on the Sunday before Memorial Day weekend.
