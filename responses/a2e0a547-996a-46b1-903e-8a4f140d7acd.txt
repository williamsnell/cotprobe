Okay, so I have this logic problem here, and I need to figure out which proposition is an immediate consequence of the given premises. Let's break it down step by step.

The premises are:

1. U ⊃ W
2. W ⊃ (X ≡ ~Y)
3. (X ≡ ~Y) ⊃ Z
4. ~Z

And the options are from A to J. I need to see which one follows directly from these premises in one step.

First, I'll try to understand each premise. 

Premise 1: If U is true, then W must be true. So U implies W.

Premise 2: If W is true, then (X ≡ ~Y) is true. That is, W implies that X is equivalent to not Y.

Premise 3: If (X ≡ ~Y) is true, then Z must be true. So (X ≡ ~Y) implies Z.

Premise 4: Z is not true, so ~Z is given.

Now, looking at the premises, I can see that they form a chain of implications. Let me try to link them together.

From 1, U → W. From 2, W → (X ≡ ~Y). From 3, (X ≡ ~Y) → Z. So combining these, U → W → (X ≡ ~Y) → Z. So effectively, U → Z.

Wait, but the fourth premise is ~Z. So if U leads to Z, and Z is not the case, then U must be false. Because if U were true, Z would have to be true, but Z is false. So U cannot be true, so U must be false. Therefore, ~U is true.

So from the premises, we can conclude that ~U is an immediate consequence. Let me check the options for ~U.

Looking at the options, option D is ~U. So that's a candidate.

But let me make sure there aren't other options that also follow immediately. Let's see:

Option A: ~W ∨ Z. Hmm, can we derive this? Well, from premise 4, ~Z is given. So ~Z is true. Now, in classical logic, anything can imply true, so ~W ∨ Z is equivalent to Z ∨ ~W. Since Z is false, ~W must be true for the disjunction to hold. Wait, no, because ~Z is given, but Z is false. So from premise 3, (X ≡ ~Y) → Z. Since Z is false, the implication would be that (X ≡ ~Y) must be false (because if the antecedent is true, the consequent must be true, which it isn't). So (X ≡ ~Y) is false. Which means X and ~Y are not equivalent. So that could lead to something, but I'm not sure if that directly gives us ~W ∨ Z.

Alternatively, let's consider modus tollens. Premise 3 is (X ≡ ~Y) → Z. Premise 4 is ~Z. So by modus tollens, we can conclude ~(X ≡ ~Y). That would make option I: (X ≡ ~Y) ∨ Z. Since (X ≡ ~Y) is false, but Z is also false, so this is a bit tricky. Wait, no, (X ≡ ~Y) ∨ Z is equivalent to ~(~(X ≡ ~Y) ∧ ~Z), which is the same as ~(X ≡ ~Y) → Z, which is the same as premise 3. But since we have ~Z, I think we can derive ~(X ≡ ~Y), so option I would be (X ≡ ~Y) ∨ Z, which is equivalent to Z ∨ ~(X ≡ ~Y). Since ~(X ≡ ~Y) is true, option I is true. So I is also a valid conclusion. But is it immediate? Let me see.

Wait, but we have four premises. So step-by-step reasoning: From premises 1,2,3,4.

Premise 1: U→W

Premise 2: W→(X≡~Y)

Premise 3: (X≡~Y)→Z

Premise 4: ~Z

So from 3 and 4, using modus tollens, we get ~(X≡~Y). That's immediate. So option I is (X≡~Y) ∨ Z, which is the same as Z ∨ (X≡~Y). Since Z is false, and (X≡~Y) is false (because we derived ~(X≡~Y)), so Z is false, but (X≡~Y) is false, so Z∨(X≡~Y) is false ∨ false = false. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, wait. Wait, if (X≡~Y) is false, then (X≡~Y) ∨ Z is equivalent to Z ∨ something that's false. But Z is false, so the whole disjunction would be false. So option I would be false, which can't be a conclusion. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here.

Wait, no. Let me think again. If (X≡~Y) is false, then (X≡~Y) ∨ Z is equivalent to Z ∨ something false, which is Z's truth value. Since Z is false, (X≡~Y) ∨ Z is false. So option I is false. So I can't conclude I is true.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think differently. Since we have (X≡~Y) → Z (premise 3), and ~Z (premise 4), by modus tollens, we can conclude ~(X≡~Y). So that's option I's antecedent being false. But option I is (X≡~Y) ∨ Z. Since (X≡~Y) is false and Z is false, the disjunction is false. So option I is not a valid conclusion.

Wait, but that can't be right. Because if (X≡~Y) is false, then (X≡~Y) ∨ Z is equivalent to Z ∨ false, which is Z. Since Z is false, the whole thing is false. So option I is false, so it can't be the conclusion. So I must have made a mistake in thinking that I is a conclusion.

Wait, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's go back. The question is which proposition is an immediate consequence. So immediate means in one step. So let's see each option.

Option D is ~U. How do we get ~U? Well, from premises 1 to 3, we have U→W→(X≡~Y)→Z. So U→Z. Given that ~Z is a premise, we can infer that U must be false. Because if U were true, Z would have to be true, but Z is false. So by modus tollens on U→Z and ~Z, we get ~U. So that's a valid step, and it's immediate.

So option D is ~U, which is an immediate consequence.

Are there other options that are immediate? Let's check.

Option B: U → Z. Because from premises 1,2,3, we have U→W→(X≡~Y)→Z, so U→Z. So that's another conclusion. So option B is U→Z. So that's also an immediate consequence because it's derived by chaining the implications.

Wait, but is that an immediate consequence? Because each step is one step, but chaining multiple premises would be multiple steps. Wait, in propositional logic, can you chain implications in one step? I think each implication is a single step, but combining them would require multiple steps. So for example, from U→W and W→(X≡~Y), you can derive U→(X≡~Y) in one step using hypothetical syllogism. Similarly, then from that and (X≡~Y)→Z, you can derive U→Z. But that would be two steps: first, from 1 and 2, get U→(X≡~Y), then from that and 3, get U→Z. So B would require two steps, but the question is asking for an immediate consequence, which is one step.

So B would not be immediate, but D is immediate because from U→Z and ~Z, you can get ~U in one step using modus tollens.

Wait, no. Wait, U→Z is not a single step; it's derived from three premises. So the immediate consequence would be something derived from just one premise and another statement.

Wait, let me clarify. In propositional logic, an immediate consequence is a conclusion that can be derived from the premises in a single inference step. So each inference step uses one or two premises, depending on the rule.

So for example, from U→W and W→(X≡~Y), using hypothetical syllogism, you can derive U→(X≡~Y) in one step. Similarly, from that and (X≡~Y)→Z, you can derive U→Z in another step. So U→Z would take two steps, but ~U from U→Z and ~Z would be one step.

Wait, but the question is about immediate consequences of the given premises. So perhaps the premises include all four, so you can use any combination. So let's see:

From premise 4: ~Z.

From premise 3: (X≡~Y) → Z.

Using modus tollens on 3 and 4: So if (X≡~Y) is true, then Z is true, but Z is false, so (X≡~Y) must be false. So we get ~(X≡~Y). That's option I: (X≡~Y) ∨ Z. Wait, no, option I is (X≡~Y) ∨ Z. Wait, but we have ~(X≡~Y), which is equivalent to ~(X) ∨ ~~~Y, which is ~X ∨ Y. Hmm, not sure if that's directly helpful.

Wait, but (X≡~Y) is equivalent to (X→~Y) ∧ (~Y→X). So if (X≡~Y) is false, then at least one of those implications is false. But perhaps that's more detailed than needed.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for the answer that's directly entailed in one step.

So let's list the possible immediate inferences:

1. From U→W and W→(X≡~Y), we can get U→(X≡~Y) via hypothetical syllogism. That's one step.

2. From U→(X≡~Y) and (X≡~Y)→Z, we can get U→Z via hypothetical syllogism. That's another step.

3. From U→Z and ~Z, we can get ~U via modus tollens. That's a third step.

But the question is which proposition is an immediate consequence. So the first step gives us U→(X≡~Y), which isn't one of the options. The second step gives us U→Z, which is option B. But that's two steps away, so not immediate.

Alternatively, perhaps from premise 4, ~Z, and premise 3, (X≡~Y)→Z, we can derive ~(X≡~Y) in one step. So that's option I? Wait, option I is (X≡~Y) ∨ Z, which is equivalent to Z ∨ (X≡~Y). Since we have ~(X≡~Y), that would make (X≡~Y) false, so Z ∨ false is Z, which is false. So option I is false, so it can't be the conclusion. So perhaps I made a mistake here.

Wait, no. Let me think again. If we have (X≡~Y)→Z, and ~Z, then by modus tollens, we can conclude ~(X≡~Y). So that's option I's antecedent being false. But option I is (X≡~Y) ∨ Z. Since (X≡~Y) is false and Z is false, the disjunction is false. So option I is not true, so it's not a valid conclusion. So that can't be the answer.

Wait, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's look at the options again.

Option D is ~U. As I thought earlier, from U→Z and ~Z, we can get ~U. So that's one step using modus tollens. So that's immediate.

So the answer should be D: ~U.
</think>

The premises given are:

1. \( U \supset W \)
2. \( W \supset (X \equiv \neg Y) \)
3. \( (X \equiv \neg Y) \supset Z \)
4. \( \neg Z \)

We need to determine which proposition is an immediate consequence of these premises.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **From Premise 3 and Premise 4**:  
   Premise 3 states \( (X \equiv \neg Y) \supset Z \), and Premise 4 states \( \neg Z \). Using modus tollens, we can conclude \( \neg (X \equiv \neg Y) \). This means \( X \equiv \neg Y \) is false.

2. **From Premise 2 and the result above**:  
   Premise 2 states \( W \supset (X \equiv \neg Y) \). Since \( X \equiv \neg Y \) is false, if \( W \) were true, the implication \( W \supset (X \equiv \neg Y) \) would be false. Therefore, \( W \) must also be false: \( \neg W \).

3. **From Premise 1 and \( \neg W \)**:  
   Premise 1 states \( U \supset W \). If \( U \) were true, \( W \) would also have to be true (as \( U \supset W \)). However, we have already established that \( W \) is false (\( \neg W \)). Therefore, \( U \) must be false: \( \neg U \).

### Conclusion:
The immediate consequence of the given premises is \( \neg U \), which corresponds to **Option D**.
