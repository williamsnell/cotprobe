Okay, so I've got this problem here about molecules with two energy levels and their populations at different temperatures. Hmm, let me think. The question says that each molecule has two nondegenerate energy levels separated by 6000 cm⁻¹. They measured the populations and found that there are exactly 8 times more molecules in the ground state than in the upper state. I need to find the temperature of the collection.

Wait, I remember that the population distribution between energy levels is given by the Boltzmann distribution. Right, the formula is something like the ratio of the populations is equal to the exponential of the energy difference over (k*T), where k is Boltzmann's constant and T is the temperature.

So, the ratio of the ground state (lower energy) to the excited state (upper energy) is 8:1. So the ratio N1/N2 = 8. Since the energy levels are nondegenerate, their statistical weights are 1 each, so that part doesn't affect the ratio.

The energy difference ΔE is given as 6000 cm⁻¹. But wait, energy in terms of wavenumbers. I think I need to convert that into energy in terms of Joules or something compatible with k. Because Boltzmann's constant k is in J/K.

Wait, I remember that 1 cm⁻¹ corresponds to energy E = h c / λ, but in terms of wavenumbers, it's E = h c * (cm⁻¹). Oh wait, cm⁻¹ is actually the reciprocal of the wavelength in cm. So each wavenumber (cm⁻¹) times Planck's constant h and the speed of light c gives energy. So the energy difference ΔE is 6000 cm⁻¹, so E = h c * (6000 cm⁻¹).

Alternatively, I think there's a shortcut because often in such problems, the energy is considered as E = hc * (wavenumber). So using E = hc * (cm⁻¹) gives the energy in Joules.

But let's get the exact relation. Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s, and the speed of light c is about 3 x 10^8 m/s. But wait, the wavenumber is in cm⁻¹, so I should convert cm to meters. 1 cm is 0.01 meters, so 1 cm⁻¹ is 100 m⁻¹. So, E = h * c * wavenumber (in m⁻¹). So for 6000 cm⁻¹, that's 6000 * 100 = 6 x 10^5 m⁻¹.

Wait, no, wait. No, the wavenumber in cm⁻¹ is already per cm. So, 6000 cm⁻¹ is 6000 per cm. So to convert to m⁻¹, it's 6000 * 100 = 6e5 m⁻¹. So E = h * c * (6e5 m⁻¹).

Let me compute that. h is 6.626e-34 J·s, c is 3e8 m/s. So E = 6.626e-34 * 3e8 * 6e5. Let me compute that step by step.

6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m. Then multiply by 6e5 m⁻¹: 1.9878e-25 * 6e5 = 1.1927e-19 J. So ΔE ≈ 1.1927e-19 J per molecule.

But wait, I think I might have made a mistake in units. Because another approach is to remember that 1 cm⁻¹ corresponds to about 1.986e-23 J. So 6000 cm⁻¹ would be 6000 * 1.986e-23 J. Let me calculate that: 6000 * 1.986e-23 = 1.1916e-19 J, which matches what I got earlier. Good.

Now, the Boltzmann factor says that N1/N2 = e^(ΔE/(k*T)), but wait, actually, no. The ratio N_upper/N_lower is e^(-ΔE/(k T)), because the upper state is higher in energy, so the lower state has more population.

Wait, no, wait: the general formula is N_i/N_j = (g_i/g_j) * e^(-(E_i - E_j)/(k T)). Since the ground state is lower energy, E_ground = E1, E_upper = E2, so E2 - E1 = ΔE. So N1/N2 = (g1/g2) * e^(-ΔE/(k T))).

Since the levels are nondegenerate, g1 = g2 = 1, so N1/N2 = e^(-ΔE/(k T)). But the problem says N1 is 8 times N2, so N1/N2 = 8. So 8 = e^(-ΔE/(k T)).

Wait, but that would give 8 = e^(-ΔE/(k T)), but that would imply that ΔE is negative, which doesn't make sense. So perhaps I should think about it as N2/N1 = e^(-ΔE/(k T)), because N2 is the upper state. Wait, no, the ratio N1/N2 is 8, which is greater than 1, so N1 is more populated than N2. So the ratio N1/N2 = e^(ΔE/(k T))? Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing up the signs.

Wait, let's get the formula right. The correct formula is N_i/N_j = (g_i/g_j) * exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k T) ). So if i is the ground state (E1) and j is the excited state (E2), then E_i - E_j = E1 - E2 = -ΔE, where ΔE = E2 - E1.

So N1/N2 = (g1/g2) * exp( - (E1 - E2)/(k T) ) = exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ) because E1 < E2, so E2 - E1 = ΔE, and E1 - E2 = -ΔE. So N1/N2 = exp(ΔE/(k T)).

Wait, because E_i is E1, E_j is E2. So E_i - E_j = E1 - E2 = -ΔE. So N1/N2 = exp( - (E1-E2)/(k T) ) = exp(ΔE/(k T)).

So that makes sense because if ΔE is positive, then the exponent is positive, and N1/N2 is greater than 1, which matches the problem statement that N1 is 8 times N2.

So now, 8 = exp(ΔE/(k T)).

Taking natural logarithm on both sides: ln(8) = ΔE/(k T).

So T = ΔE/(k * ln(8)).

So I can compute T as ΔE divided by (k multiplied by ln(8)).

I have ΔE as about 1.1916e-19 J.

k is Boltzmann's constant, approximately 1.380649e-23 J/K.

So let's compute ln(8): ln(8) is about 2.079.

So T = (1.1916e-19 J) / (1.380649e-23 J/K * 2.079).

Compute denominator: 1.380649e-23 * 2.079 ≈ 2.867e-23 J/K.

So T ≈ 1.1916e-19 / 2.867e-23 ≈ (1.1916 / 2.867) * 1e4.

Compute 1.1916 / 2.867 ≈ 0.4153.

So 0.4153 * 1e4 = 4153 K.

Looking at the options, F is 4152 K, which is very close. So the correct answer should be F.

The problem involves determining the temperature of a collection of molecules where the population ratio between the ground state and the upper energy state is 8:1. Using the Boltzmann distribution, the ratio of populations is given by:

\[
\frac{N_1}{N_2} = e^{\Delta E / (k T)}
\]

Here, \( \Delta E = 6000 \, \mathrm{cm}^{-1} \), which is converted to energy using \( E = h c \cdot \text{wavenumber} \). This yields \( \Delta E \approx 1.1916 \times 10^{-19} \, \mathrm{J} \). The ratio \( N_1/N_2 = 8 \) implies:

\[
8 = e^{\Delta E / (k T)}
\]

Taking the natural logarithm:

\[
\ln(8) = \frac{\Delta E}{k T}
\]

Rearranging for \( T \):

\[
T = \frac{\Delta E}{k \cdot \ln(8)}
\]

Substituting \( \Delta E = 1.1916 \times 10^{-19} \, \mathrm{J} \), \( k = 1.380649 \times 10^{-23} \, \mathrm{J/K} \), and \( \ln(8) \approx 2.079 \):

\[
T = \frac{1.1916 \times 10^{-19}}{1.380649 \times 10^{-23} \cdot 2.079} \approx 4153 \, \mathrm{K}
\]

The closest option is F: 4152 K.
