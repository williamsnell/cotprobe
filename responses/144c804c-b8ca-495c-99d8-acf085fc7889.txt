Okay, so I have this problem here: I need to find the least possible positive integer value of n such that the square root of 18 times n times 34 is an integer. Hmm, let me try to break this down.

First, the expression inside the square root is 18 * n * 34. I think I should write that out: √(18 * n * 34). I know that for a square root to be an integer, the expression inside must be a perfect square. So, 18 * n * 34 needs to be a perfect square.

Let me factor each number to see what's going on. 18 can be broken down into prime factors: 18 = 2 * 3^2. And 34 is 2 * 17. So when I multiply them together with n, I get:

18 * 34 = (2 * 3^2) * (2 * 17) = 2^2 * 3^2 * 17.

So the expression inside the square root becomes 2^2 * 3^2 * 17 * n. Since we want this to be a perfect square, each prime factor must have an even exponent.

Looking at the factors we have so far: 2^2 is already even, 3^2 is even, but 17 is only to the first power, which is odd. So, to make the entire product a perfect square, n must provide another factor of 17 to make 17^2. Wait, but is that all?

Wait, let me think again. The expression is 2^2 * 3^2 * 17 * n. So the primes involved are 2, 3, and 17. For each prime, their exponents need to be even. Let's check each:

- 2: exponent is 2, which is even.
- 3: exponent is 2, even.
- 17: exponent is 1, which is odd.

So to make the entire product a perfect square, the exponent of 17 must be even. Therefore, n must contribute at least one 17 to make it 17^2. So n should be 17?

Wait, but wait a second. Let me make sure I haven't missed any other primes. Suppose n has other prime factors besides 17. For example, if n has a prime factor that's not 2, 3, or 17, then we'd have to include that as well to make the exponent even. But since we're looking for the smallest possible n, the minimal n would be just the one that makes the existing exponents even.

So n needs to provide another 17, right? So n =17. Let me check that.

If n=17, then 18 * 34 *17 = 18 * (34*17) = 18 * 578. Wait, let me compute that.

Wait, no, 34 *17 is 578, right? Because 30*17=510 and 4*17=68, so 510+68=578. Then 18 *578. Hmm, let me calculate that.

18 *578: 10*578=5780, 8*578=4624. So 5780 + 4624 = 10,404. Is 10,404 a perfect square? Let me check what's the square root of 10,404.

I know that 100^2=10,000, so 102^2=10,404 because 102*102: 100*100=10,000, 100*2=200, 2*100=200, 2*2=4. So 10,000 + 200 + 200 +4=10,404. Yep, that's correct. So √10,404=102, which is an integer.

So n=17 works. But wait, is there a smaller n that could work? Let me see.

If n=17, then the exponents are 2^2 *3^2 *17^2, which is a perfect square. If n were smaller, say n=2, then 18*2*34=18*68. Let me calculate that: 18*60=1080, 18*8=144, so 1080+144=1224. Is 1224 a perfect square? Let's see, 34^2=1156, 35^2=1225. Oh, 1224 is just 1 less than 35^2, so it's not a perfect square. So n=2 doesn't work.

What about n=1? Then 18*1*34=612. Is 612 a perfect square? 24^2=576, 25^2=625, so no.

n=3: 18*3=54, 54*34=1836. Is 1836 a perfect square? 42^2=1764, 43^2=1849, so no.

n=4: 18*4=72, 72*34=2448. 49^2=2401, 50^2=2500, so no.

n=6: 18*6=108, 108*34=3672. 60^2=3600, 61^2=3721, so no.

n=17 is the next option. So that's the smallest n. Wait, but the options include 17 as option F. So the answer must be F:17.

Wait, but let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in considering n=17. Are there any other factors I missed?

Wait, 18*34=612. So 612 is 2^2 *3^2 *17. So to make 612*n a perfect square, the product must have even exponents for all primes. So 2^2 is fine, 3^2 is fine, 17 is to the first power, so n must have 17 to make it 17^2. So n=17 is indeed the smallest.

The least possible positive integer value of \( n \) is 17, as it makes the expression inside the square root a perfect square.

Answer: F
