Okay, so I've got this problem about finding the voltage across a linear time-varying inductor. Let me try to unpack this step by step. 

The inductance is given as L(t) = L0(t + tanh t). Wait, no, wait a second. Oh, wait, actually, the expression is L(t) = L0(t + tanh t)? Hmm, no, wait. No, because tanh t is a hyperbolic function, and when t is time, that might complicate things. Or maybe it's L(t) = L0 multiplied by (t + tanh t). Oh wait, no, actually, looking again, I think it's L(t) = L0 (t + tanh t), but wait, that doesn't make much sense dimensionally because t would have units of time, and tanh t is dimensionless. So maybe I misread it. Let me check the original question again. Oh, wait, no, the question says L(t) = L0 (t + tanh t). Hmm, that's a bit odd because tanh t would be a unitless term, and t would have units of time. So adding them would be mixing units, which isn't possible. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the expression. Oh wait, perhaps it's L(t) = L0 (t + tanh t), but that would imply L0 has units of inductance per time, which might be the case, but it's a bit unusual. Alternatively, perhaps it was a typo, and it's L(t) = L0 (t + tanh t), but that's what it says. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps it's L(t) = L0 multiplied by (t + tanh t) as in a function of t. Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's L(t) = L0 (t + tanh t), which would be a time-varying inductance that starts at L0 when t=0, since tanh(0)=0, so L(0)=L0*(0 + 0) = 0, wait that can't be right. Wait, no, because when t=0, tanh(0)=0, so L(0) would be L0 * (0 + 0) = 0? That seems odd. Maybe I'm misinterpreting the expression. Alternatively, perhaps it's L(t) = L0(t + tanh t), but that seems off. Wait, perhaps the expression is L(t) = L0 multiplied by (t + tanh t), but maybe that's correct. Alternatively, maybe it's a typo, and it's L(t) = L0 (tanh t), but I'll proceed with what's given.

The current through the inductor is i(t) = cos(ωt). We need to find the voltage across it.

I remember that for an inductor, the voltage is given by v(t) = L di/dt + (dL/dt) i(t). Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, no. Actually, the voltage across an inductor is given by v(t) = L(t) * di/dt + (dL/dt) * i(t). Because the inductance is changing with time, so there's a term from the rate of change of inductance multiplied by the current.

So let me write that down:

v(t) = d/dt (1/2 L(t) i(t)^2 ) ? No, that's the energy. Oh no, wait, the voltage is v(t) = L(t) * (di/dt) + i(t) * (dL/dt). Yes, that's correct. Because when inductance changes with time, the voltage has two contributions: one from the changing current through the inductance, and another from the change in inductance itself multiplied by the current.

So first, I'll compute di/dt. i(t) is cos(ωt), so di/dt is -ω sin(ωt).

Next, I'll compute dL/dt. L(t) = L0 (t + tanh t), so dL/dt is L0 (1 + sech² t). Because the derivative of tanh t is sech² t. So yes, dL/dt = L0 (1 + sech² t).

Putting it all together:

v(t) = L(t) * di/dt + i(t) * dL/dt

= L0 (t + tanh t) * (-ω sin(ωt)) + cos(ωt) * L0 (1 + sech² t)

Hmm, wait, but looking at the options, I don't see any term with (t + tanh t) multiplied by sin(ωt). Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options:

Option C: U(t) = L0 (1 + sech²t) cosωt - ω L0 (t + tanht) sinωt

Option D: U(t) = L0 (1 - sech²t) cosωt - ω L0 (t + tanht) sinωt

Option B: U(t) = L0 (1 + sech²t) cosωt + ω L0 (t + tanht) sinωt

Wait, but in my calculation, I have:

v(t) = [L0 (t + tanh t)] * (-ω sinωt) + [L0 (1 + sech²t)] cosωt

So that's = L0 (1 + sech²t) cosωt - ω L0 (t + tanh t) sinωt

Which matches option C.

Wait, but looking back, the options are labeled as A to J, and option C is:

C: U(t) = L0 (1 + sech²t)cosωt - ω L0 (t + tanht) sinωt

Yes, that's exactly what I got.

So the answer should be option C.
</think>

The voltage across the inductor is calculated using the formula \( v(t) = L(t) \frac{di}{dt} + i(t) \frac{dL}{dt} \). Substituting \( i(t) = \cos(\omega t) \) and \( L(t) = L_0 (t + \tanh t) \), we find \( \frac{di}{dt} = -\omega \sin(\omega t) \) and \( \frac{dL}{dt} = L_0 (1 + \text{sech}^2 t) \). Combining these gives the voltage expression matching option C.
