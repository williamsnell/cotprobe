Okay, so I have this question about child development and attachment. The question is about the adaptive response of a six-month-old who shows distress when an attachment figure leaves. The options are A through J. Let me try to break this down.

First, I need to remember what each of these terms means. I know that attachment theory is about how infants form bonds with their caregivers. The key term here is the child's reaction when the attachment figure leaves. So, the question is asking about the specific response, which is distress, when the person they're attached to leaves.

Let me go through each option:

A: Reactive attachment disorder (RAD). I think RAD is a disorder where a child doesn't form secure attachments and might show Indifferent or resistant behavior. It's usually due to severe neglect or abuse. But the question is about a normal adaptive response, so maybe not RAD.

B: Separation anxiety. This sounds familiar. Separation anxiety is when a child gets anxious when separated from a caregiver. It's a normal part of development, usually peaking around 6-8 months, which fits the six-month-old. So this seems like a strong candidate.

C: Stranger anxiety. That's when a child is wary of strangers, usually around 6-12 months. It's a different kind of anxiety, not specifically about separation from an attachment figure. So this might not be the right answer.

D: Avoidant attachment. Avoidant attachment is one of the insecure attachment styles. Children with avoidant attachment might avoid seeking comfort from a caregiver and show little emotion when the caregiver leaves. But the question is about the child showing distress, so avoidant attachment doesn't fit because the child wouldn't necessarily show distress; they might be more detached.

E: Secure attachment. Secure attachment is when a child feels confident that their caregiver will return and uses the caregiver as a "secure base." While secure attachment is a good thing, the question is about the response when the attachment figure leaves, which is more about the anxiety that comes from the separation, not the secure base itself.

F: Ambivalent attachment. Ambivalent or resistant attachment is another insecure style. These children may show distress when the caregiver leaves but also have difficulty being comforted upon reunion. It's a bit similar, but the question is about an adaptive response, which might imply a more typical reaction rather than an insecure one.

G: Attachment anxiety. I'm not as sure about this one. I think attachment anxiety could be a general term, but maybe it's more specific to something else. Separation anxiety might be a more precise term.

H: Object permanence. That's about understanding that objects exist even when they're out of sight. It's a cognitive development milestone, not really about attachment or separation.

I: Dependent attachment. This might refer to being overly dependent, but I'm not sure if this is a standard term in attachment theory. More likely, it's about the child's anxiety when separated.

J: Disorganized attachment. This is another attachment style, often seen in children who experienced early trauma. They might show conflicting behaviors, like approaching the caregiver but then avoiding. But again, the question is about a six-month-old's adaptive response, which would be a typical reaction, not an insecure one.

Putting it all together, the key is the child's distress when the attachment figure leaves. Separation anxiety (B) fits perfectly because it's the normal reaction to being separated from a primary caregiver. Stranger anxiety (C) is about strangers, not the caregiver leaving. Avoidant and ambivalent are attachment styles, which are more about the pattern of behavior rather than the anxiety response itself. 

So I think the answer is B: separation anxiety.

The correct answer is B: separation anxiety. This is the normal reaction a six-month-old might have when their attachment figure leaves, characterized by distress. 

Answer: B
