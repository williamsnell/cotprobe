Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about finding the energy stored in the electrostatic field between two concentric conducting spheres. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. 

The problem states that there are two spheres: one with radius R and the other with 2R. Both have charges of magnitude Q but opposite signs. So, one must be positively charged, and the other negatively. 

Wait, I remember that when dealing with the energy stored in an electric field, especially for conductors, there's a formula involving the capacitance. The energy U is given by U = Q²/(2C), where C is the capacitance. Right, so I need to find the capacitance of this system first.

But wait, these are concentric spheres. I think the formula for the capacitance of a single sphere is C = 4πε₀ R. But wait, here we have two concentric spheres. How does that work? Oh, right! When you have two concentric conducting spheres, the capacitance is determined by the outer sphere's radius and the charge configuration.

Wait, no. Let me correct myself. The inner sphere has charge +Q, and the outer sphere has charge -Q. Since the spheres are conductors, the charges will distribute themselves on the surfaces. The inner sphere's charge induces an equal and opposite charge on the inner surface of the outer sphere. Similarly, the outer sphere's charge would have induced a charge on the inner sphere, but wait, no, the inner sphere is already conducting and isolated, so it's just +Q. Or maybe I should think of it as a system where the inner has +Q, and the outer has -Q, making the total charge zero? Hmm, but the way capacitance works in such a setup.

Wait, I think the capacitance of two concentric spheres is given by C = (4πε₀) * (R * 2R)/(2R - R) )? No, that doesn't seem right. Or is it more about the potential difference between them?

Alternatively, I remember that for a single sphere of radius R, the capacitance is C = 4πε₀ R. But for two concentric spheres, the capacitance is C = 4πε₀ * (R * 2R)/(2R - R) )? Wait, no, that might be for a spherical capacitor. Oh, right! A spherical capacitor consists of two concentric conducting spheres, with radii R_inner and R_outer. The capacitance is C = 4πε₀ * (R_inner * R_outer)/(R_outer - R_inner).

Yes, that's the formula I was thinking of. So here, R_inner is R, and R_outer is 2R. Plugging those in, C = 4πε₀ * (R * 2R)/(2R - R) ) = 4πε₀ * (2R²)/(R) ) = 4πε₀ * 2R = 8πε₀ R.

Wait, wait. Let me double-check that calculation. R_outer is 2R, R_inner is R. So C = (4πε₀) * (R)(2R) / (2R - R) ) = (4πε₀) * (2R²) / R ) = 4πε₀ * 2R. So yeah, C = 8πε₀ R.

Now that I have the capacitance, the energy stored is U = Q²/(2C). Substituting C, U = Q²/(2*(8πε₀ R)) ) = Q²/(16πε₀ R). 

Looking at the options, let's see. Option D is Q²/(16πε₀ R), which matches my calculation. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the capacitance formula.

Wait, another thought: sometimes the formula for the energy stored in a capacitor is U = (1/2) Q V, where V is the potential difference. Alternatively, for a system with two charges, maybe I should think about the work done in bringing the charges from infinity to their positions. But since these are conductors, the capacitance approach should be more straightforward.

Alternatively, calculating the potential difference between the two spheres. The potential at the outer sphere (radius 2R) due to the inner sphere (radius R) with charge Q is V = Q/(4πε₀ R). Since the outer sphere has charge -Q, the potential at the outer sphere would be -Q/(4πε₀ (2R)). Wait, but the potential on the outer sphere is due to both the inner charge and the outer charge. Hmm, but since the outer sphere is a conductor, the potential across it is the same everywhere, so the potential difference between the two spheres is V_outer - V_inner.

Wait, the inner sphere has charge +Q, so the potential at the outer sphere (2R) due to this charge is Q/(4πε₀ (2R)). The outer sphere's charge is -Q, which contributes a potential of -Q/(4πε₀ (2R)) at the surface of itself, but wait, no, the potential inside a conductor is constant. So the potential at the outer sphere is due to both charges.

Wait, maybe I'm complicating this. The potential on the surface of the inner sphere is V_inner = Q/(4πε₀ R). The potential on the surface of the outer sphere is V_outer = Q/(4πε₀ (2R)) + (-Q)/(4πε₀ (2R)). Wait, but that would be zero, which can't be right. No, that approach is wrong because the outer sphere's charge is -Q, which would affect the potential at infinity as well, but since the outer sphere is a conductor, the potential inside it is the same as on its surface, and the inner sphere's potential is determined by its charge.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the entire system as a capacitor where the inner sphere is one plate and the outer is the other. The capacitance C is 4πε₀ (R * 2R)/(2R - R) ) = 8πε₀ R, as before. So U = Q²/(2C) = Q²/(16πε₀ R), which is option D.

Wait, but wait another moment. Let me make sure about the potential difference. The potential at the inner sphere is higher than the outer. The potential difference V is V_inner - V_outer. Since the inner sphere has +Q, V_inner = Q/(4πε₀ R). The outer sphere has -Q, so the potential at the outer sphere due to the inner charge is Q/(4πε₀ (2R)), and the potential due to its own charge is -Q/(4πε₀ (2R)). But wait, the outer sphere's own charge doesn't contribute to the potential difference between the two spheres because it's a conductor; the potential is the same everywhere on it. So the potential difference is just the potential at the inner sphere minus the potential at the outer due to the inner charge, plus the potential at the outer due to the outer charge? Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, the potential difference V between the two spheres is the potential at the inner sphere minus the potential at the outer sphere, which is (Q/(4πε₀ R)) - [Q/(4πε₀ (2R)) + (-Q)/(4πε₀ (2R)] )? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the outer sphere's charge would make the potential at infinity different, but in this case, it's a conductor, so the potential is continuous.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to stick with the capacitance approach. Since the capacitance is C = 8πε₀ R, then U = Q²/(2C) = Q²/(16πε₀ R), which is option D. So I'm confident that D is the correct answer.

The energy stored in the electrostatic field between two concentric conducting spheres can be determined using the capacitance formula. The capacitance of a spherical capacitor with inner radius \( R \) and outer radius \( 2R \) is given by:

\[
C = 4\pi \epsilon_0 \frac{R \cdot (2R)}{2R - R} = 8\pi \epsilon_0 R
\]

The energy stored in the system is then calculated using the formula \( U = \frac{Q^2}{2C} \), substituting the capacitance:

\[
U = \frac{Q^2}{2 \cdot (8\pi \epsilon_0 R)} = \frac{Q^2}{16\pi \epsilon_0 R}
\]

This matches option D.
