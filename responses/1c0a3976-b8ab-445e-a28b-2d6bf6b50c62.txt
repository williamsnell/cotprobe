Okay, so I've got this difference equation to solve. The equation is y[n] - (5/6)y[n-1] + (1/6)y[n-2] = 3^n, and the initial conditions are y[-1] = 0 and y[-2] = 0. The question asks me to find y[n] using the sum of the steady-state and homogeneous solutions. The answer choices are from A to J, and I need to pick the correct one.

First, I remember that to solve a linear difference equation with constant coefficients, I should split it into homogeneous and particular (steady-state) solutions. So, the general solution is y[n] = y_h[n] + y_p[n].

Starting with the homogeneous part: the homogeneous equation is y[n] - (5/6)y[n-1] + (1/6)y[n-2] = 0. To find the homogeneous solution, I'll set up the characteristic equation. The characteristic equation is obtained by assuming a solution of the form r^n. Plugging that in, we get:

r^n - (5/6)r^{n-1} + (1/6)r^{n-2} = 0.

Dividing both sides by r^{n-2} (assuming r ≠ 0), we get the characteristic equation:

r^2 - (5/6)r + (1/6) = 0.

Now, I need to solve this quadratic equation. Multiplying all terms by 6 to eliminate fractions:

6r^2 - 5r + 1 = 0.

Using the quadratic formula, r = [5 ± sqrt(25 - 24)] / (12) = [5 ± sqrt(1)] / 12. So, the roots are (5 +1)/12 = 6/12 = 1/2, and (5-1)/12 = 4/12 = 1/3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is:

y_h[n] = A*(1/2)^n + B*(1/3)^n,

where A and B are constants to be determined.

Next, I need to find the particular solution, y_p[n]. The nonhomogeneous term is 3^n. Since 3 is not a root of the characteristic equation (the roots are 1/2 and 1/3), I can try a particular solution of the form y_p[n] = C*3^n.

Plugging y_p[n] into the original equation:

C*3^n - (5/6)C*3^{n-1} + (1/6)C*3^{n-2} = 3^n.

Factor out 3^{n-2}:

3^{n-2} [C*9 - (5/6)C*3 + (1/6)C] = 3^n.

Simplify inside the brackets:

C*9 - (5/6)C*3 = C*(9 - (5/2)) = C*(13/2).

Then, (1/6)C remains. So, the bracket becomes (13/2)C + (1/6)C. Let's compute that:

(13/2 + 1/6) C = (39/6 + 1/6) C = (40/6) C = (20/3) C.

So, the equation becomes 3^{n-2}*(20/3) C = 3^n.

3^{n-2} is 3^n / 9, so:

(20/3) C * (3^n /9 ) = (20 C / 27) 3^n.

Set this equal to the right-hand side, which is 3^n. So:

(20 C / 27) 3^n = 3^n.

Divide both sides by 3^n:

20C/27 = 1 → C = 27/20.

So, the particular solution is y_p[n] = (27/20) 3^n.

Now, the general solution is y[n] = y_h[n] + y_p[n] = A*(1/2)^n + B*(1/3)^n + (27/20)3^n.

Next, I need to apply the initial conditions to find A and B. But wait, the initial conditions given are y[-1] = 0 and y[-2] = 0. Hmm, that's a bit tricky because usually, initial conditions are given for n=0, 1, etc. But in this case, they are given for negative n. I need to handle that carefully.

Let me write the general solution again:

y[n] = (27/20)3^n + A*(1/2)^n + B*(1/3)^n.

But I need to find A and B using y[-1] = 0 and y[-2] = 0.

Wait, but the homogeneous solution includes terms like (1/2)^n and (1/3)^n. For n = -1 and n = -2, these terms become (1/2)^{-1} = 2 and (1/2)^{-2}=4, and similarly for (1/3)^{-1}=3, (1/3)^{-2}=9.

So, let's plug n = -1 into the general solution:

y[-1] = (27/20)3^{-1} + A*(1/2)^{-1} + B*(1/3)^{-1} = 0.

Simplify each term:

3^{-1} = 1/3 → (27/20)(1/3) = 9/20.

(1/2)^{-1} = 2 → A*2.

(1/3)^{-1} = 3 → B*3.

So, equation becomes:

9/20 + 2A + 3B = 0.

Similarly, plug n = -2 into the general solution:

y[-2] = (27/20)3^{-2} + A*(1/2)^{-2} + B*(1/3)^{-2} = 0.

3^{-2}=1/9 → (27/20)(1/9)= 3/20.

(1/2)^{-2}=4 → A*4.

(1/3)^{-2}=9 → B*9.

So, equation becomes:

3/20 + 4A + 9B = 0.

Now, I have two equations:

1) 2A + 3B = -9/20.

2) 4A +9B = -3/20.

Let me write them more clearly:

Equation 1: 2A + 3B = -9/20.

Equation 2: 4A +9B = -3/20.

I can solve this system using substitution or elimination. Let's use elimination. Let's multiply Equation 1 by 2 to get:

4A +6B = -18/20.

Now, subtract Equation 2 from this:

(4A +6B) - (4A +9B) = (-18/20) - (-3/20).

Which simplifies to:

-3B = (-15)/20 → -3B = -3/4.

So, B = (-3/4)/(-3) = 1/4.

Now, plug B=1/4 into Equation 1:

2A + 3*(1/4) = -9/20 → 2A + 3/4 = -9/20.

Convert 3/4 to 15/20, so:

2A +15/20 = -9/20 → 2A = (-9/20 -15/20) = -24/20 = -6/5.

Thus, A = (-6/5)/2 = -3/5.

So, A = -3/5 and B=1/4.

Now, substituting back into the general solution:

y[n] = (27/20)3^n - (3/5)(1/2)^n + (1/4)(1/3)^n.

Looking at the options, option C is y[n] = (27/20)3^n - (3/5)(1/2)^n + (1/4)(1/3)^n.

Wait, but let me check the options again. Option C is as I have here. So the correct answer should be option C.

The solution involves finding the homogeneous and particular solutions. The homogeneous part yields roots 1/2 and 1/3, leading to a homogeneous solution. The particular solution is found using the method of undetermined coefficients, resulting in a particular term proportional to 3^n. Applying initial conditions to the general solution gives the constants A and B, leading to the final answer.
