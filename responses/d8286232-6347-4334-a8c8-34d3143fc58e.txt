Okay, so I have this question about what 'new economics' refers to, and I need to choose the correct option from A to J. I'm not too familiar with the term, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that in economics, there are different schools of thought like Keynesian and monetarist. Keynesian economics focuses on demand-side measures, like government spending to stimulate the economy, while monetarist emphasizes controlling the money supply. There's also classical economics, which is more about free markets and minimal government intervention.

The term 'new economics' isn't something I've heard in a specific context before, so I'll have to consider the options given. Let's go through each one.

Option A says it's policies that focus solely on supply-side measures. I know supply-side economics is about reducing taxes and regulations to encourage production. But 'new economics' as a broader term doesn't seem to fit just one approach; it's probably more inclusive.

Option B suggests it's a synthesis of Keynesian and monetarist positions. That makes sense because sometimes economic theories combine elements from different schools. Keynesians and monetarists have had debates, but in practice, many modern policies blend both approaches. So this could be a possible answer.

Option C talks about returning to classical theories. If 'new economics' were about going back, it wouldn't really be 'new.' I think it's more likely to be a newer synthesis rather than a return.

Option D is about focusing on monetary policy. While monetarism does focus on money supply, I don't think 'new economics' is just about that. It's probably a broader term.

Option E emphasizes psychological aspects. Behavioral economics does study economic behavior from a psychological perspective, but I'm not sure if that's what 'new economics' refers to. It might be part of it, but I'm not certain.

Option F is about interdisciplinary studies, combining economics with engineering or biology. That sounds more like a specific field within economics rather than what 'new economics' generally means.

Option G suggests it rejects both Keynesian and monetarist positions. I don't recall a major school that does that; most modern approaches blend elements from both.

Option H says it's the latest theories. That's a bit vague. 'Latest' could mean anything, and without context, it's hard to pin down.

Option I is about environmental sustainability. Green economics or ecological economics might fit here, but I'm not sure if that's what 'new economics' is commonly referred to as.

Option J is about applying economics to digital currencies. That seems too specific; probably not the general meaning.

Putting this together, the most plausible answer is B. 'New economics' as a synthesis of Keynesian and monetarist positions. It combines elements from both, which is a common approach in modern macroeconomics. I think that's the correct choice.
