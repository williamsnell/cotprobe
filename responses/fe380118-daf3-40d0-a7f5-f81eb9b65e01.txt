Alright, so I'm trying to figure out the percentage of 8-year-old children in Ethiopia who reported physical punishment by teachers in the past week in 2009. The options are A through J, with numbers ranging from 8% to 98%, so I need to think about what the likely answer is.

First, I remember that Ethiopia has had issues with school discipline, and physical punishment by teachers is unfortunately not uncommon in many parts of the world. However, I'm not exactly sure about the exact percentage for 2009. I think I've read something about this before, maybe from a report or a study.

I recall that some African countries have higher rates of physical punishment in schools, sometimes due to cultural norms or lack of resources. Ethiopia, being a large country with diverse regions, might have varying statistics. But I'm not sure if it's as high as 58% or 68%, which are some of the higher options.

Wait, I think there was a study done around that time, maybe by UNICEF or another organization, that looked into child discipline practices. If I remember correctly, the percentage was in the higher range but not extremely high. Let me thinkâ€”options like 48%, 58%, or even 68% are possibilities. 

I also remember that sometimes these studies might report that a significant portion of children experience physical punishment. So 48% seems plausible. Alternatively, I might be confusing it with another country's data. I'm not entirely certain, but I'll go with my initial thought that the percentage was around 48%.
