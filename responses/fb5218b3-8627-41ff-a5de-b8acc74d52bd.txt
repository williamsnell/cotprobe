Question:

What is wrong in the following array declaration? int my _ array (200);

Options:

A: The datatype for the array elements is not specified
B: The array is not initialized
C: The array size is too large
D: The semicolon is missing at the end of the declaration
E: The array size should be a constant expression
F: The array size must be defined after the variable name
G: The number of subscripts is not enclosed in square brackets

Answer:

Okay, so I've got this question about an array declaration in C, and I need to figure out what's wrong with it. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The code given is: int my _ array (200);

Hmm, wait, I notice that the variable name is written as my _ array. Oh, right, in C, variable names can't have spaces, but underscores are allowed. So that part seems okay, except I'm thinking maybe it's a typo because of the two underscores. Or maybe I misread it. Wait, no, the user wrote my _ array, which is two underscores? Or maybe it's a typo, but I think in C, it's allowed. So the naming isn't the issue here.

Looking at the structure, it's declared as int my_array(200);. Wait, no, the code is written as int my _ array (200);. Oh wait, no, in C, when you declare an array, you have to use square brackets. So the correct syntax should be int my_array[200];. But in the given code, it's using parentheses instead, like a function call. So that's probably the main issue.

So the problem is that the array size isn't enclosed in square brackets. Instead, it's using parentheses, which is incorrect for array declarations. So the error is that the subscript isn't enclosed in square brackets.

Looking at the options, option G says: The number of subscripts is not enclosed in square brackets. That must be the correct answer.

Wait, let me check the other options to make sure I'm not missing anything:

A: The datatype for the array elements is not specified. No, because it's int, so the datatype is specified.

B: The array is not initialized. Well, in C, you don't have to initialize arrays at declaration, so that's not an error.

C: The array size is too large. Well, 200 is a reasonable size, and in C, the size just needs to be a compile-time constant, so it's okay.

D: The semicolon is missing. No, the semicolon is present at the end.

E: The array size should be a constant expression. Yes, the size must be a constant, but in the given code, 200 is a constant, so that's not the issue here.

F: The array size must be defined after the variable name. No, the syntax is int name[size];, so that's correct.

So the main issue is the use of parentheses instead of square brackets. So option G is the correct answer.
</think>

The issue with the array declaration `int my _ array (200);` is that the array size should be enclosed in square brackets, not parentheses. The correct syntax is `int my_array[200];`, making option G the correct answer.

Answer: G
