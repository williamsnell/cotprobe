Okay, so I've got this question about insurance coverage after a car accident. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the scenario: Frank Lincoln's car had a blow-out, causing it to swerve and hit John Martin's car. Leon Taylor was a passenger in Martin's car and had medical expenses of $6,251. John Martin himself had medical bills totaling $75. Lincoln has a 5/10 bodily injury insurance policy. The question is asking how much his insurance company will pay.

Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on insurance terms, but I think I remember that the numbers in the policy usually represent the limits per person and per accident. So a 5/10 policy would mean $5,000 per person and $10,000 per accident, right? Wait, no, wait—actually, in some cases, it's per person and per occurrence, but I might be mixing things up. Let me think again.

Wait, no, more accurately, a 5/10 policy is usually written as $5,000 per person and $10,000 per accident. So the first number is the per-person coverage, and the second is the maximum per accident, which covers all individuals involved.

In this case, there are two people: Leon Taylor and John Martin. Leon's bills are $6,251, and John's are $75. So the total medical expenses for both are $6,251 + $75 = $6,326.

Now, the insurance policy is 5/10, so per person, the limit is $5,000. But wait, does that mean each person's claim is capped at $5,000, or is it that the total per accident can't exceed $10,000, regardless of how many people are involved?

I think it's the latter. The 5/10 policy means up to $5,000 per person injured, but the total for the accident can't exceed $10,000. So if multiple people are injured, their individual payments are each up to $5,000, but the total across all can't go beyond $10,000.

So Leon's claim is $6,251, which is more than $5,000. John's claim is $75, which is under $5,000. So for Leon, the insurance would pay up to $5,000, and for John, they'd pay the full $75. Adding those together, the total paid would be $5,000 + $75 = $5,075.

Wait, but wait a second. Another thought—maybe the 5/10 policy is structured as $5,000 per person and $10,000 per accident. So each person can claim up to $5k, but the total across all claims can't exceed $10k. So in this case, Leon's claim is $6,251, which exceeds $5k, but the insurance would only pay $5k for him. John's claim is $75, so they pay that. So the total would be $5,075, which is under the $10k limit. So the insurance company would pay $5,075 in total.

Looking at the options, option G is $5,075. So that's the answer.

Wait, but another angle: sometimes, the per-person limit is the first number, and the per-accident is the second. So 5/10 would be $5k per person and $10k per accident. So if each person's claim is under $5k, the total is under $10k. But since Leon's claim is over $5k, the insurance would only pay $5k for him, and John's $75. So total is $5,075. So yes, G.

The insurance policy is a 5/10, meaning $5,000 per person and up to $10,000 per accident. Leon's claim is $6,251, exceeding the $5,000 per-person limit, so the insurance pays $5,000 for him. John's claim is $75, which is fully covered. The total payment is $5,075, which is under the $10,000 accident limit. 

Answer: G
