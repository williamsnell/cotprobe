Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about the major noneconomic argument for pure capitalism. The question is asking what the major noneconomic argument is, given that the major economic argument is maximum economic efficiency. The options are from A to J.

First, I need to understand what pure capitalism is. Pure capitalism, or laissez-faire capitalism, is an economic system where the government intervention is kept to a minimum. The main idea is that free markets and individual freedoms drive economic growth and efficiency.

The question is about the noneconomic argument, so I'm looking for something that's not related to the economy but is a reason people support capitalism. The economic argument is efficiency, so the noneconomic one would be something else, perhaps related to personal freedoms, rights, or social aspects.

Looking at the options:

A: Capitalism results in single authority. Hmm, that sounds more like a critique, maybe pointing towards a lack of regulation, but I'm not sure if this is a major argument in favor.

B: Capitalism ensures job security. Wait, isn't job security more of a concern in mixed economies or socialism? Pure capitalism might have less job security because companies can hire and fire more freely, so this might not be a strong argument.

C: Capitalism fosters cultural diversity. Maybe, but I'm not sure how directly that's tied as a major argument. It's possible but not the first that comes to mind.

D: Capitalism promotes personal freedom. That makes sense. In pure capitalism, individuals have more freedom to make their own economic choices without government interference. Personal freedom is a strong noneconomic reason.

E: Capitalism encourages moral responsibility. I'm not sure. While some might argue that, it's not as directly a major point as personal freedom.

F: Capitalism provides a platform for technological innovation. That's more of an economic argument because innovation drives growth and efficiency. So it's economic, not noneconomic.

G: Capitalism leads to wealth equality. Actually, pure capitalism can lead to wealth inequality, so this is probably a negative point, not a supporting argument.

H: Capitalism improves international relations. I don't think this is a major argument. International relations are influenced by many factors, not just economic systems.

I: Capitalism enhances individual creativity. This is possible, as free markets allow people to pursue their creative ideas, but again, it's more about the economic outcomes than a noneconomic reason.

J: Capitalism supports sustainable environmental practices. This is more of a modern critique, as pure capitalism might prioritize growth over environmental protection, so this is probably not a supporting argument.

So, the options boil down to D and maybe C or I. But D, promoting personal freedom, seems like a strong noneconomic argument. It's about individual liberties and not being restricted by government control, which is a key tenet of pure capitalism.

Therefore, the major noneconomic argument is D: Capitalism promotes personal freedom.

The major noneconomic argument for pure capitalism is that it promotes personal freedom, as individuals have the liberty to make their own economic choices without government interference.

Answer: D
