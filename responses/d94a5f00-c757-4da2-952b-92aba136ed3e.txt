Question:

The dorsal root of a nerve leading to the leg of a rat is severed. How will this affect the rat? How would the effect vary if the ventral root were severed instead?

Options:

A: Severing either the dorsal or ventral root will result in the rat's inability to regenerate the affected nerve.
B: Severing the dorsal root will prevent sensory impulses from reaching the brain, resulting in loss of sensation and reflex action. Severing the ventral root will prevent motor impulses from reaching the muscles, resulting in inability to move the affected limb.
C: Severing either root will have no effect on the rat.
D: Severing the ventral root will cause the rat to lose control over its body temperature regulation in the affected limb.
E: Severing the dorsal root will result in increased motor function in the affected limb, while severing the ventral root will lead to increased sensitivity to pain.
F: Severing the ventral root will enhance the rat's ability to move the affected limb.
G: Severing the dorsal root will enhance the rat's sense of touch.
H: Severing the dorsal root will improve the rat's coordination and balance, while severing the ventral root will lead to a loss of muscular strength.
I: Severing the ventral root will result in the loss of sensation in the affected limb, while severing the dorsal root will not affect the limb's functionality.
J: Severing the dorsal root will cause paralysis in the affected limb, whereas severing the ventral root will have no significant effect on the rat's limb function.

Okay, so I've got this question about the effects of severing the dorsal or ventral roots of a nerve leading to a rat's leg. I'm a bit rusty on my neuroanatomy, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that each spinal nerve has both a dorsal (posterior) and a ventral (anterior) root. The dorsal root is sensory, right? So it's responsible for transmitting sensory information from the body to the central nervous system, which includes the brain. The ventral root, on the other hand, is motor—it carries signals from the central nervous system to the muscles and glands, controlling movement.

So if the dorsal root is severed, the sensory pathway is disrupted. That means the brain won't receive any sensory information from that part of the body. So the rat would lose sensation in the affected leg. But wait, what about reflex actions? Reflexes are quick responses that don't go through the brain. For example, the knee-jerk reflex. Those are handled by the spinal cord. So if the sensory part is cut, the reflex might not happen because the signal can't get to the motor part. So the rat would lose both sensation and the ability to perform reflex actions in that limb.

Now, what if the ventral root is severed? That's the motor part. So the muscles won't receive the signals from the brain or spinal cord. That would mean the rat can't move the affected limb—it would be paralyzed. But wait, what about sensory functions? The sensory part (dorsal root) is still intact, so the rat would still feel things, but couldn't move in response.

Looking at the options, let's go through them one by one.

Option A: Both roots severed cause inability to regenerate. I don't think that's right. Nerve regeneration is possible, though it's limited, and it's more about the type of injury than just severing the root. So probably not A.

Option B: Severing dorsal root prevents sensory impulses, so loss of sensation and reflex. Ventral prevents motor, so can't move. That matches what I was thinking. So B seems correct.

Option C: No effect? No way. Both have significant functions, so C is wrong.

Option D: Ventral root affects body temperature? Not sure. Ventral is motor, maybe autonomic, but body temp is controlled by other systems. Not sure, but D doesn't seem right.

Option E: Dorsal increases motor function? No, if you cut the sensory, motor should be fine unless the motor is also affected. Wait, but E says increased motor when dorsal is cut, which doesn't make sense. Cutting the sensory shouldn't affect motor unless they're both in the same nerve. But in reality, each nerve has both roots but serves different functions. So E is probably wrong.

Option F: Ventral severed enhances movement? No, because cutting the motor root would stop movement. So F is wrong.

Option G: Dorsal enhances touch? If you cut the sensory root, you lose touch, not enhance it. So G is incorrect.

Option H: Dorsal improves coordination, ventral loses strength. Wait, if the motor root is cut (ventral), the muscles can't get signals, so strength would be lost. But if the sensory is cut (dorsal), coordination might be affected because the brain isn't getting feedback. So H might have some truth, but I'm not certain. Let me think. Coordination relies on both sensory and motor inputs. But the question is about the immediate effect. So if the motor is cut, you can't move, so strength is lost. If sensory is cut, you lose reflexes but maybe coordination is less, but the option says 'improve coordination' which doesn't make sense. So H is probably wrong.

Option I: Ventral causes loss of sensation? No, that's the opposite. Ventral is motor, so severing it would affect movement, not sensation. So I is wrong.

Option J: Dorsal causes paralysis? No, because cutting the sensory root shouldn't paralyze; it's the motor that does. So J is wrong.

So the correct answer must be option B.

The question involves understanding the roles of the dorsal and ventral roots of spinal nerves in a rat. The dorsal root is sensory, transmitting information from the body to the central nervous system, while the ventral root is motor, controlling muscle movements. Severing the dorsal root disrupts sensory pathways, leading to loss of sensation and reflexes, as reflexes rely on sensory input processed by the spinal cord. Severing the ventral root disrupts motor pathways, causing paralysis of the affected limb, though sensation would remain intact.

Analyzing the options, option B correctly describes the effects: severing the dorsal root results in loss of sensation and reflexes, while severing the ventral root causes inability to move the limb. Other options either conflate the roles of the roots or propose incorrect effects.

Answer: B
