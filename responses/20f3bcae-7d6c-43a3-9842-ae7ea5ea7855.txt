Okay, so I have this probability problem here, and I need to find the density function of Y, where Y is X squared, and X has a given density function. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the original density function is f(X) = 1/(π(1 + X²)) for all real numbers X. So, X can be any real number, positive or negative. That means the distribution of X is symmetric around zero because if you plug in -X, you get the same value as for X. So, the density is even, which might be useful later.

Now, Y is defined as X squared, so Y is always non-negative. That makes sense because squaring any real number can't give a negative result. So, the support for Y is y > 0.

I remember that when dealing with transformations of random variables, especially when Y is a function of X, I should use the method of transformation or perhaps the cumulative distribution function (CDF) technique. Since Y is X squared, maybe the transformation method is the way to go.

Let me recall the transformation method. If Y = g(X), and g is monotonic in the neighborhood of X, then the density function of Y can be found using the formula:

h(y) = f(g^{-1}(y)) * |d/dy [g^{-1}(y)]|

But in this case, Y = X², which is not one-to-one over the entire real line because both positive and negative X can give the same Y. So, I think I need to account for both possibilities.

Alternatively, I could use the CDF method. The CDF of Y, H(y), is the probability that Y ≤ y, which is the same as P(X² ≤ y). That simplifies to P(-sqrt(y) ≤ X ≤ sqrt(y)). Since the density is symmetric, I can compute this as twice the integral from 0 to sqrt(y) of f(x) dx.

Wait, let me write that down:

H(y) = P(Y ≤ y) = P(X² ≤ y) = P(-sqrt(y) ≤ X ≤ sqrt(y)) = 2 * ∫ from 0 to sqrt(y) of f(x) dx.

Since f(x) is 1/(π(1 + x²)), the integral becomes 2/(π) ∫ from 0 to sqrt(y) [1/(1 + x²)] dx.

The integral of 1/(1 + x²) dx is arctan(x). So, evaluating from 0 to sqrt(y) gives arctan(sqrt(y)) - arctan(0). Arctan(0) is 0, so it's arctan(sqrt(y)).

Therefore, H(y) = 2/(π) * arctan(sqrt(y)).

Now, to find the density h(y), I need to take the derivative of H(y) with respect to y.

So, h(y) = dH/dy = (2/π) * d/dy [arctan(sqrt(y))].

Let me compute that derivative. The derivative of arctan(u) with respect to u is 1/(1 + u²), and then I need to multiply by the derivative of u with respect to y, where u = sqrt(y).

So, d/dy [arctan(sqrt(y))] = [1/(1 + (sqrt(y))²)] * (1/(2 sqrt(y))).

Simplifying (sqrt(y))² is just y, so the denominator becomes 1 + y. So, it's 1/(1 + y) multiplied by 1/(2 sqrt(y)).

Putting it all together, h(y) = (2/π) * [1/(1 + y)] * [1/(2 sqrt(y))].

The 2 in the numerator and denominator cancels out, leaving h(y) = 1/(π (1 + y) sqrt(y)).

Wait, let me check that algebra again. 2/(π) multiplied by 1/(2 sqrt(y)) gives (2 * 1)/(π * 2 sqrt(y)) = 1/(π sqrt(y)). So, h(y) = [1/(π sqrt(y))] * [1/(1 + y)].

Which is h(y) = 1/(π sqrt(y) (1 + y)).

Alternatively, I can write that as 1/(π sqrt(y) (1 + y)).

Looking at the options, I need to see which one matches this expression.

Let me look at the options:

Option B: h(y) = [2 / {π√y (1 + y)}] for y > 0, else 0.

Option I: h(y) = [1 / {2π√(1 + y)} ] for y >0, else 0. Hmm, no, wait. Let me check again.

Wait, the options might have LaTeX formatting, so I need to parse them correctly.

Option B: h(y) = [2 / {π√y(1 + y)}] for y > 0 and =0 otherwise.

Option I: h(y) = [1 / {2π√(1 + y)}] for y >0 and=0 otherwise.

Wait, no, looking back, the options are:

Looking at the options again:

Option B: h(y) = [2 / {π√y(1 + y)}] for y > 0 and=0 otherwise.

Option I: h(y) = [1 / {2π√(1 + y)}] for y>0 and=0 otherwise.

Wait, no, looking back at the original options:

Looking again, the options are:

A: h(y) = [2 / {π(1 + sqrt(y))}] for y > 0 and =0 otherwise.

B: h(y)= [2 / {π√y(1 + y)}] for y>0 and=0 otherwise.

C: h(y) = [1 / {π(1 + y²)}] for y>0 and=0 otherwise.

D: h(y) = [1 / {2π(1 + sqrt(y))}] for y>0 and=0 otherwise.

E: h(y) = [1 / {2π(1 + y²)}] for y>0 and=0 otherwise.

F: h(y)= [e^(-y) / {2π√(1 + y)}] for y>0 and=0 otherwise.

G: h(y)=[1 / {π√y(1 + y)}] for y>0 and=0 otherwise.

H: h(y)=[1 / {π(2 + sqrt(y))}] for y>0 and=0 otherwise.

I: h(y)= [1 / {2π√y(1 + y)}] for y>0 and=0 otherwise.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me re-express my derived h(y):

h(y) = 1/(π sqrt(y) (1 + y)).

So, that's 1/(π (1 + y) sqrt(y)).

Looking at the options:

Option B is 2/(π sqrt(y) (1 + y)).

Option G is 1/(π sqrt(y) (1 + y)).

Option I is 1/(2π sqrt(y) (1 + y)).

Wait, no. Let me check each option carefully.

Option B: 2 / [π sqrt(y) (1 + y)].

Option G: 1 / [π sqrt(y) (1 + y)].

So, my derived h(y) is 1/(π sqrt(y)(1+y)).

That matches exactly with option G.

Wait, but earlier when I did the calculation, I thought I had 1/(π sqrt(y)(1+y)), which is option G. But I thought I had 1/(π sqrt(y)(1+y)), which is option G.

Wait, but looking back, in my calculation, I had:

h(y) = (2/π) * [1/(1 + y)] * [1/(2 sqrt(y))] = (2/π) * (1/(2 sqrt(y)(1 + y))) )= 1/(π sqrt(y)(1 + y)).

Yes, that's correct. So, option G is h(y)= [1 / {π√y(1 + y)}] for y>0 and 0 otherwise.

But wait, looking again, option B is 2/(π sqrt(y)(1 + y)).

Wait, did I make a mistake in the calculation? Let me check again.

H(y) = 2/(π) * arctan(sqrt(y)).

Then, h(y) = dH/dy = 2/π * [1/(1 + (sqrt(y))^2)] * (1/(2 sqrt(y))).

Because d/dy arctan(u) = (1/(1 + u²)) * du/dy, where u = sqrt(y), so du/dy = 1/(2 sqrt(y)).

So, h(y) = (2/π) * [1/(1 + y)] * [1/(2 sqrt(y))] = (2/π) * (1)/(2 sqrt(y)(1 + y)) )= (1)/(π sqrt(y)(1 + y)).

So, that's correct. So, the correct h(y) is 1/(π sqrt(y)(1 + y)).

Looking back at the options:

Option G: h(y) = [1 / {π√y(1 + y)}] for y>0 and=0 otherwise.

Yes, that's option G.

Wait, but earlier I thought I was looking at option B, but no. So, the correct answer should be option G.
</think>

The density function of Y is derived by transforming the given density of X. Using the transformation method, Y = X² implies Y is non-negative. By computing the CDF of Y and differentiating, the resulting density function simplifies to h(y) = 1/(π√y(1 + y)) for y > 0. This matches option G.
