Okay, so I've got this problem about a circle's equation, and I need to find the sum of the center coordinates and the radius. Hmm, let me try to remember how to do this. I think it involves rewriting the equation into the standard form of a circle, which is (x - a)^2 + (y - b)^2 = r^2, where (a, b) is the center and r is the radius.

The given equation is x² + 12y + 57 = -y² - 10x. I should probably move all the terms to one side to make it easier to work with. Let me add y² and 10x to both sides to get rid of the negatives on the right. That would give me x² + 10x + y² + 12y + 57 = 0.

Wait, no, I think I messed up. Let me check that again. The original equation is x² +12y +57 = -y² -10x. So if I add y² and 10x to both sides, it should be x² +10x + y² +12y +57 = 0. Yes, that's right.

Now I need to complete the square for both x and y terms. Let's group them. So, x² +10x and y² +12y. 

Starting with the x terms: x² +10x. To complete the square, I take half of 10, which is 5, and square it to get 25. So, I'll add and subtract 25. But wait, I can't just add numbers to one side without balancing, so I have to add 25 to both sides as well.

For the y terms: y² +12y. Half of 12 is 6, and squaring that gives 36. So, I add 36 to complete the square here too. Again, I have to add 36 to both sides.

Let me write this out step by step.

Starting equation after moving terms:
x² +10x + y² +12y +57 = 0

Now, complete the square for x and y:

x² +10x +25 -25 + y² +12y +36 -36 +57 = 0

Wait, maybe it's better to rearrange as:

(x² +10x) + (y² +12y) = -57

Now, add the squares to both sides:

(x² +10x +25) + (y² +12y +36) = -57 +25 +36

Calculating the right side: -57 +25 is -32, then +36 gives 4. So the equation becomes:

(x +5)^2 + (y +6)^2 = 4

Wait, let me double-check the signs. The standard form is (x - a)^2 + (y - b)^2 = r^2. So in this case, it's (x +5)^2 which is (x - (-5))^2, and (y +6)^2 which is (y - (-6))^2. So the center (a, b) is (-5, -6), right? And the radius squared is 4, so r is 2.

Now, the question asks for a + b + r. So a is -5, b is -6, and r is 2. Adding them together: -5 + (-6) + 2 = (-5 -6) +2 = -11 +2 = -9.

Wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the calculations. Let me go through the steps again.

Original equation: x² +12y +57 = -y² -10x.

Bring all terms to left: x² +10x + y² +12y +57 = 0.

Completing the square:

x² +10x: add (10/2)^2=25.

y² +12y: add (12/2)^2=36.

So, add 25 and 36 to both sides:

x² +10x +25 + y² +12y +36 = 0 +25 +36.

Left side becomes (x+5)^2 + (y+6)^2 = 61.

Wait, that's not matching what I had before. Wait, 0 +25 +36 is 61, so equation is (x+5)^2 + (y+6)^2 = 61. But that would make the radius sqrt(61), which is about 7.81. But earlier I thought it was 4. Did I make a mistake earlier?

Oh no, I think I messed up the moving of terms. Let me check the initial step again.

Original equation: x² +12y +57 = -y² -10x.

Bring all terms to left by adding y² and 10x to both sides:

x² +10x + y² +12y +57 = 0.

Wait, that's correct. Now, moving on.

So, x² +10x + y² +12y = -57.

Now, completing the square for x: take 10, half is 5, square 25. So add 25.

For y: 12, half is 6, square 36. Add 36.

So, add 25 and 36 to both sides.

Left side becomes (x+5)^2 + (y+6)^2.

Right side: -57 +25 +36.

Calculate: -57 +25 is -32, then +36 is 4.

So equation is (x+5)^2 + (y+6)^2 = 4.

So center is at (-5, -6), radius is sqrt(4)=2.

So a + b + r = (-5) + (-6) +2 = -9.

Wait, but when I did it the second time, I thought I had 61 on the right, but that was a miscalculation. No, no, the correct right side is 4, because -57 +25 is -32, plus 36 is +4. So yes, radius is 2.

So the sum is -5 -6 +2 = -9.

Looking back at the options, option J is -9. So the answer should be J.

The equation is rewritten and completed to the square, revealing the center (-5, -6) and radius 2. Summing these gives -9.

Answer: J
