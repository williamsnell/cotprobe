Okay, so I have this economics question about how the Japanese economy expanding affects U.S. net exports, the value of the dollar, and the value of the yen. I need to figure out the correct answer from options A to J. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I remember that when an economy expands, it usually means that the country is growing, so people might be buying more goods and services. Japan's economy expanding probably means Japanese consumers and businesses are buying more stuff.

Now, the question is about the impact on U.S. net exports. Net exports are calculated as exports minus imports. If Japan is expanding, they might be importing more from the U.S. because they have more money to spend. So, if the U.S. is exporting more to Japan, that would increase U.S. net exports. Wait, but net exports could also be affected by other factors like the exchange rate.

Next, the value of the dollar and the yen. I think when a country's economy is doing well, its currency might strengthen because more people want to invest in it. So if Japan's economy is expanding, maybe the yen would appreciate (increase in value) because investors have more confidence in Japan.

But how does that affect the U.S. dollar? If the yen is getting stronger, the dollar might get weaker relative to the yen. Because when the yen appreciates, the dollar's value decreases against it. So the dollar's value would decrease.

Wait, but let me think again. If the U.S. exports more to Japan because Japan is expanding, that would mean more U.S. goods are sold in Japan. So U.S. exports increase. But net exports are exports minus imports. If the U.S. is importing more from Japan as well, because Japan is producing more and maybe their goods are cheaper or more desirable, then net exports might not increase as much. Hmm, this is confusing.

Alternatively, maybe the expansion of Japan's economy increases their demand for U.S. goods, which would boost U.S. exports, leading to an increase in U.S. net exports. But I'm not entirely sure.

As for the currencies: If Japan's economy is expanding, their central bank might not need to干预 as much, so the yen could appreciate. A stronger yen would make U.S. goods more expensive for Japan, potentially reducing U.S. exports. Wait, that might lower net exports. So that's conflicting with my earlier thought.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about the balance of payments. If Japan is expanding, they might buy more from the U.S., increasing U.S. exports. That would increase U.S. net exports. But if the yen appreciates, the dollar would depreciate. Because when the yen is stronger, each yen can buy fewer dollars, so the dollar's value goes down.

Wait, let's use an example. Suppose before, 1 yen was equal to 0.01 dollars (so 100 yen = 1 dollar). If the yen appreciates, maybe 1 yen equals 0.015 dollars (so 66.67 yen = 1 dollar). Now, the dollar has depreciated because each dollar buys fewer yen. So the dollar's value decreases.

So, in this scenario, U.S. net exports would increase because Japan is buying more U.S. goods due to their expansion. The yen's value increases, and the dollar's value decreases.

Wait, but I'm getting conflicting thoughts. Let me try to outline the steps:

1. Japan's economy expands → higher income → higher demand for imports, including from the U.S.
2. Higher demand for U.S. goods → U.S. exports increase.
3. U.S. net exports = exports - imports. If exports go up and imports stay the same or go up less, net exports increase.
4. Now, the effect on currencies: Japan's higher income might lead to higher demand for U.S. goods, but also, if Japan's economy is strong, their currency (yen) might appreciate because investors want to hold yen assets.
5. When yen appreciates, the price of U.S. goods in yen terms becomes more expensive. Wait, no—if the yen is stronger, each dollar buys fewer yen, so U.S. goods in yen terms are cheaper? Or more expensive?

Wait, let me think about exchange rates. If the yen appreciates against the dollar, that means 1 yen can buy more dollars. So the dollar depreciates. So, from the U.S. perspective, their goods become cheaper in Japan because the yen is stronger. So U.S. exports to Japan would increase, which is good for net exports.

So, putting it together:

- U.S. net exports increase because they export more to Japan.
- The yen's value increases (appreciates).
- The dollar's value decreases (depreciates).

Wait, but let me check if that's correct. If the yen appreciates, the exchange rate (yen per dollar) increases. So, for example, if it was 100 yen per dollar, and it appreciates to 120 yen per dollar, that means the yen has weakened, right? Because now it takes more yen to buy a dollar. Wait, no, that's depreciation of the yen. So I think I got that wrong earlier.

Wait, exchange rates can be confusing. The exchange rate is usually quoted as foreign currency per domestic currency. So, for example, USD/JPY is dollars per yen. If USD/JPY increases, that means the dollar is appreciating against the yen, or the yen is depreciating.

Wait, no. If USD/JPY increases from 100 to 120, that means each dollar buys more yen. So the dollar has appreciated, and the yen has depreciated.

In the initial scenario, Japan's economy is expanding. If Japan is doing well, investors might buy more yen, causing the yen to appreciate (so USD/JPY would decrease, meaning yen is stronger). So yen appreciates, dollar depreciates.

So, if yen appreciates, USD/JPY goes down. So the dollar's value decreases (it's weaker), and the yen's value increases.

So, in this case:

- U.S. net exports: increase because Japan is importing more from the U.S.
- Value of the dollar: decrease (because it's weaker)
- Value of the yen: increase (because it's stronger)

Looking back at the options, I need to match these three.

Looking at the options:

A: Decrease     Increase     Decrease → No, because net exports increase.

B: Increase     Increase     Increase → Dollar increases? No, it should decrease.

C: Decrease     No Change     Increase → No, net exports increase.

D: Increase     Increase     Decrease → Dollar increases? No.

E: Decrease     Decrease     Increase → No.

F: No Change     Increase     Decrease → No.

G: Increase     Decrease     Increase → Yes, this matches.

H: Increase     No Change     Decrease → No.

I: Decrease     Increase     Increase → No.

J: Decrease     Decrease     Decrease → No.

So the correct option is G: Increase     Decrease     Increase.

As the Japanese economy expands, it leads to an increase in U.S. net exports because Japan's higher income levels and demand for imports, including U.S. goods, rise. The value of the yen increases (appreciates) due to stronger investor confidence in Japan, while the value of the dollar decreases (depreciates) as the yen becomes stronger relative to the dollar.

Answer: G
