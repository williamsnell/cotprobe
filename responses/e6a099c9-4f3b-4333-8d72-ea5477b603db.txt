Okay, so I have this question about coloring the faces of a cube with three colors, and I need to find out how many distinct ways there are, considering rotations. Hmm, I remember something about group theory and Burnside's lemma from my studies, but I'm not super confident. Let me think this through step by step.

First, without considering rotations, the number of ways to color the cube would be 3^6, since each of the six faces can be colored with any of the three colors. That's 729 ways. But of course, many of these are equivalent under rotation, so I need to account for that.

I think Burnside's lemma is the way to go here. The lemma states that the number of distinct colorings is equal to the average number of colorings fixed by each element of the rotation group. So I need to find all the symmetry operations of the cube and determine how many colorings each symmetry fixes.

The cube's rotation group consists of all the rotations that map the cube onto itself. Let me list the types of rotations:

1. The identity rotation: doing nothing. This obviously fixes all possible colorings, so it contributes 3^6 = 729.

2. Rotations about an axis through the centers of opposite faces. There are three axes (x, y, z), and for each axis, we can rotate by 90°, 180°, or 270°. So that's 3 rotations per axis, times 3 axes, totaling 9 non-identity rotations here.

3. Rotations about an axis through opposite edges. These are 180° rotations. There are six such axes, each contributing one non-identity rotation. So 6 rotations.

4. Rotations about an axis through opposite vertices. These axes go through two opposite vertices and can be rotated by 120° and 240°. There are four such axes, each contributing two non-identity rotations. So 4 axes × 2 rotations = 8 rotations.

Let me add these up: 1 (identity) + 9 (face) + 6 (edge) + 8 (vertex) = 24 elements in the rotation group. Yeah, that's right because the cube has 24 rotational symmetries.

Now, I need to calculate the number of colorings fixed by each type of rotation.

Starting with the identity: as I said, all 729 colorings are fixed.

Next, face rotations. Let's take a 90° rotation about the z-axis. For a coloring to be fixed under this rotation, the four side faces (front, right, back, left) must all be the same color. The top and bottom can be any color. So, the number of fixed colorings here would be 3 (for the four side faces) × 3 (top) × 3 (bottom) = 3^3 = 27. Wait, no, wait. Because when you rotate 90°, each face in the cycle must be the same color. So the four side faces form a cycle, so they must all be the same color. The top and bottom are fixed, so their colors can be anything. So for each 90° rotation, fixed colorings are 3 (for the four sides) × 3 (top) × 3 (bottom) = 3^3 = 27. Wait, but that's for a 90° rotation. But what about 180° and 270°?

Wait, let me think again. For a 180° rotation about a face axis, the four side faces are paired into two pairs (front-back and left-right). So each pair must be the same color. So each pair can be any color, but the two pairs can be different. So for the four side faces, they must be colored in two colors, each pair having the same color. So the number of colorings fixed by a 180° rotation is 3 (for front-back) × 3 (for left-right) × 3 (top) × 3 (bottom) = 3^4 = 81? Wait, no, that can't be right because that's more than the total colorings. Wait, no, wait. No, wait, because each face is a separate entity. Let me clarify.

Wait, when you rotate 180° around the face axis, each face is mapped to another face. For example, front goes to back, left goes to right, etc. So for a coloring to be fixed, front must equal back, left must equal right, but top and bottom can be any color. So the four side faces must be such that front=back and left=right. So the four side faces have two independent color choices: front/back can be any color, left/right can be any color. So the number of fixed colorings is 3 (front/back) × 3 (left/right) × 3 (top) × 3 (bottom) = 3^4 = 81. Wait, but that's for a 180° rotation.

Wait, but wait, when you rotate 180°, each face is swapped with its opposite. So for a coloring to be fixed, the color of each face must equal the color of the face it's swapped with. So for a 180° rotation about a face axis, front must equal back, left must equal right, and top must equal bottom. So that's three pairs, each pair must be the same color. So the number of fixed colorings is 3^3 = 27. Oh, I see where I went wrong earlier. So 3 choices for front/back, 3 for left/right, 3 for top/bottom: 3×3×3=27.

Wait, but in the 90° case, the four side faces form a cycle of four. So each of the four must be the same color. So that's 3 choices for the four sides, and then 3 for top and 3 for bottom, so 3×3×3=27 as well. Wait, but 90° and 270° are similar in that they both cycle four faces. So each 90° rotation (and 270°, which is equivalent to three 90° rotations) fixes 3^3=27 colorings.

So for each face rotation axis (three axes), the rotations are 90°, 180°, 270°. So for each axis, 90° and 270° contribute 27 fixed colorings each, and 180° contributes 27 as well. So each face rotation contributes 27 fixed colorings.

Wait, no: let's see. For each face axis:

- 90° rotation: four side faces must be same color. So fixed colorings: 3 (sides) × 3 (top) × 3 (bottom) = 27.

- 180° rotation: front=back, left=right, top=bottom. So fixed colorings: 3×3×3 = 27.

- 270° rotation: same as 90°, but in the opposite direction. So again, four sides must be same color, so 27 fixed colorings.

So each face rotation (three axes, each with three rotations: 90°, 180°, 270°) contributes 3×27=81 fixed colorings. Wait, no, no. Wait, for each rotation, the number of fixed colorings is as above. So for each of the nine face rotations (three axes, three rotations each), the fixed colorings are 27 each. So total fixed colorings from face rotations: 9×27=243.

Wait, but that can't be right because when you add up all the fixed colorings from all group elements, you have to sum them up and divide by the group size (24) to get the average, which should be the number of distinct colorings.

Wait, let me proceed step by step. Let me categorize each type of rotation and compute the fixed colorings for each type.

1. Identity rotation: fixes all colorings. So 3^6 = 729.

2. 90° and 270° rotations about face axes: Each such rotation has four side faces in a cycle. So for a coloring to be fixed, all four must be the same color. So the number of fixed colorings is 3 (for the four sides) × 3 (top) × 3 (bottom) = 27. There are 6 such rotations (three axes, each with two non-180° rotations: 90° and 270°).

3. 180° rotations about face axes: As above, front=back, left=right, top=bottom. So three pairs, each pair same color. So 3^3=27. There are 3 such rotations (one per face axis).

4. 180° rotations about edge axes: These rotations swap two pairs of opposite faces. For example, imagine rotating around an axis through the midpoints of front and back faces. Wait, no, wait: no, edge axes go through midpoints of opposite edges. So a rotation of 180° around such an axis swaps the top and bottom faces, and swaps the left and right faces, while keeping the front and back fixed? Wait, no, maybe I'm confusing this.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to think about how the faces are permuted under each rotation.

Wait, another approach: when you rotate 180° about an edge axis, it swaps two pairs of opposite faces. For example, imagine rotating the cube 180° around an axis that goes through the midpoints of the top and bottom edges. This would swap front with back, left with right, and top with bottom. Wait, no, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps it swaps front with back, left with right, but top and bottom stay the same. Hmm, I'm getting confused. Let me think: when you rotate 180° around an edge axis, each face is moved to another face. Let me consider the cube with faces labeled front, back, left, right, top, bottom.

Wait, perhaps an edge axis goes through the midpoints of front-top and back-bottom edges, for example. Rotating 180° around that axis would swap front with back, top with bottom, and left with right. Wait, no, perhaps that's not correct. Alternatively, maybe it swaps front and back, and top and bottom, while left and right are swapped. Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of how the faces are permuted.

Alternatively, perhaps a 180° rotation around an edge axis will cause two pairs of opposite faces to swap. So for example, front and back are swapped, left and right are swapped, but top and bottom remain the same. Or maybe front and back are swapped, top and bottom are swapped, and left and right are swapped. Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to consider that a 180° rotation about an edge axis will result in each face being mapped to another face. So for a coloring to be fixed, each face must be the same color as the face it's mapped to. So for example, if front is mapped to back, then front and back must be the same color. Similarly, left and right must be the same color, and top and bottom must be the same color. So in this case, the number of fixed colorings would be 3^3 = 27, same as the 180° face rotations.

Wait, but this might not always be the case. Maybe in some edge rotations, only two pairs are swapped, but the others remain fixed. Wait, no, because all faces are involved in the rotation. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think: for a 180° edge rotation, each face is either mapped to another face or stays the same. Let me take a specific example. Suppose the rotation axis goes through the midpoints of the top and bottom edges on the front and back faces. So when you rotate 180°, the front face swaps with the back face, the top face swaps with the bottom face, and the left and right faces swap as well. So all three pairs are swapped. So for the coloring to be fixed, front=back, top=bottom, left=right. So three pairs, each must be same color. So 3^3 = 27 fixed colorings.

Wait, but I'm not 100% sure about this. Alternatively, maybe the edge rotation only affects two pairs and leaves two faces fixed. Hmm, perhaps I should look for another approach.

Wait, maybe I can find the cycle structure of the permutation induced by each rotation on the faces. For Burnside's lemma, the number of fixed colorings under a permutation is 3^k, where k is the number of cycles in the permutation.

So let's consider each type of rotation and find the number of cycles in the face permutation.

1. Identity: each face is a cycle of length 1. So 6 cycles. So fixed colorings: 3^6 = 729.

2. 90° face rotation: the four side faces form a single cycle of length 4, and the top and bottom are fixed. So the permutation has one cycle of length 4 and two cycles of length 1. So total cycles: 3. So fixed colorings: 3^3 = 27.

3. 180° face rotation: the four side faces form two cycles of length 2 each (front-back and left-right), and top and bottom are fixed. So cycles: two cycles of length 2 and two cycles of length 1. So total cycles: 4. Fixed colorings: 3^4 = 81? Wait, no, that can't be right because earlier I thought it was 27. Wait, no, perhaps I made a mistake here.

Wait, no, wait: When you rotate 180° around a face axis, the front and back faces are swapped, and the left and right faces are swapped. So front and back form a 2-cycle, left and right form another 2-cycle, top and bottom are each fixed (1-cycles). So the permutation has two 2-cycles and two 1-cycles. So total cycles: 2 + 2 = 4. Therefore, fixed colorings are 3^4 = 81. But earlier I thought it was 27. Hmm, that's contradictory. So where did I go wrong?

Wait, perhaps I confused the effect of the rotation. Let me think again: when you rotate 180° about the face axis, each face is either fixed or swapped with another face. So front swaps with back, left swaps with right, top swaps with bottom. So each of these three pairs must have the same color. So front=back, left=right, top=bottom. So that's three pairs, each can be colored independently. So the number of fixed colorings is 3 × 3 × 3 = 27.

Wait, but according to the cycle index approach, it's 3^4=81. There's a contradiction here. Which one is correct?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the cycle structure. Let me model this more carefully. Let's say we have a cube with faces front (F), back (B), left (L), right (R), top (T), bottom (Bot). When you rotate 180° around the z-axis (through top and bottom), the permutation is F→B, B→F, L→R, R→L, T stays T, Bot stays Bot. So the cycles are (F B)(L R)(T)(Bot). So that's two 2-cycles and two 1-cycles, totaling four cycles. So the number of fixed colorings should be 3^4=81. But earlier reasoning suggested that front must equal back, left=right, top=bottom, which would be 3^3=27. So which is it?

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the rotation. If front and back are swapped, then for the coloring to be fixed, F must equal B. Similarly, L must equal R, and T must equal Bot. So the number of constraints is three: F=B, L=R, T=Bot. So the number of colorings is 3^3=27, not 3^4=81.

Wait, but according to the cycle index approach, each cycle can be colored independently. So for each cycle, all the faces in that cycle must have the same color. So in this case, the two 2-cycles (F-B and L-R) and two 1-cycles (T and Bot). So for each 2-cycle, the two faces must have the same color. So for the F-B cycle, F and B must be same color, which is 3 choices. Similarly, L and R must be same color, 3 choices. T is fixed, so 3 choices, and Bot is fixed, 3 choices. So total fixed colorings: 3 × 3 × 3 × 3 = 81. But that contradicts the earlier reasoning where I thought it's 3^3=27.

Wait, but that can't be, because if T and Bot are fixed, they can be colored independently. So in that case, the four cycles (two 2-cycles and two 1-cycles) would allow each to be colored independently, leading to 3^4=81. But according to the earlier logic, T and Bot are fixed, so their colors can be anything, which would mean they can vary independently, leading to 3^4=81. But earlier I thought that T and Bot must be the same color, which is not the case. Wait, no, in a 180° rotation around the z-axis (face axis), T and Bot are fixed, meaning they don't move; thus, their colors can remain as they are. So if T is red and Bot is blue, after rotation, T is still red and Bot is still blue. So their colors don't have to be the same. Therefore, the fixed colorings under this rotation would require F=B, L=R, but T and Bot can be any color, including different ones. So the number of fixed colorings is 3 (F=B) × 3 (L=R) × 3 (T) × 3 (Bot) = 3^4=81.

Wait, but that contradicts my earlier thought where I thought it would be 27. So which is correct?

Wait, let me take a simple example. Suppose I color F and B as red, L and R as blue, T as green, and Bot as yellow. If I rotate 180° around the z-axis, F goes to B, which is red, so same color. L goes to R, which is blue. T stays green, Bot stays yellow. So this coloring is fixed. So in this case, T and Bot are different colors, and the coloring is fixed. So yes, the number of fixed colorings is indeed 3^4=81.

So earlier reasoning where I thought it's 27 was wrong. The correct number is 81. So I must have made a mistake earlier.

Wait, but that changes the calculation significantly. So let me correct that.

So for the face rotations:

- Identity: 729.

- 90° and 270° rotations (each face axis has two such rotations): each has cycle structure (4-cycle + 2 fixed faces). So number of cycles: 1 (4-cycle) + 2 (fixed) = 3 cycles. So fixed colorings: 3^3=27 per rotation. There are 6 such rotations (3 axes × 2 rotations each).

- 180° face rotations: each has two 2-cycles and two 1-cycles, so 4 cycles. Fixed colorings: 3^4=81 per rotation. There are 3 such rotations.

Wait, but earlier I thought the 180° rotations fixed 27 colorings, but now it's 81. That's a big difference. Let me confirm with another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I should model each rotation's effect on the cube and count the fixed colorings accordingly.

For face rotations:

1. 90° and 270°: As before, four side faces must be same color. So 3 choices for them, and 3 each for top and bottom. So 3 × 3 × 3 = 27.

2. 180°: The four side faces are swapped in two 2-cycles, so front=back and left=right. So 3 choices for front/back, 3 for left/right, and top and bottom can be any color, 3 each. So 3 × 3 × 3 × 3 = 81.

So that's correct.

Now, moving on to the edge rotations: 180° rotations about an axis through the midpoints of opposite edges.

Let's consider the cycle structure here. Suppose the rotation axis goes through the midpoints of the front-top and back-bottom edges. Rotating 180° swaps front with back, top with bottom, and left with right. So each face is swapped with another face. So the permutation has three 2-cycles: (F B)(T Bot)(L R). So each 2-cycle requires the two faces to be the same color. So number of fixed colorings is 3^3=27.

Wait, but according to the cycle index approach, the number of cycles is three 2-cycles, so number of colorings is 3^3=27.

But wait, earlier I thought that for a face 180° rotation, it's 81, and for edge 180° rotations, it's 27. Let me confirm with an example.

Suppose we have a coloring where F=B, T=Bot, L=R. Then, any rotation that swaps these pairs will leave the coloring unchanged. So for an edge rotation, the three pairs must each be same color, leading to 3^3=27 fixed colorings.

So for each edge rotation, fixed colorings: 27.

There are six edge rotations (each axis through midpoints of opposite edges, and each has one non-identity rotation: 180°). So 6 rotations × 27 = 162.

Now, vertex rotations: 120° and 240° rotations about an axis through opposite vertices.

Each such rotation cycles three faces around one vertex and three faces around the opposite vertex.

For example, imagine rotating 120° around the axis through the top-front-right and bottom-back-left vertices. This would cycle the top, front, and right faces, and similarly cycle the bottom, back, and left faces in the opposite direction.

So the permutation would consist of two 3-cycles: (T F R)(Bot B L). So each 3-cycle requires all three faces in the cycle to have the same color.

Therefore, for a coloring to be fixed under this rotation, T=F=R and Bot=B=L. So each 3-cycle must be monochromatic. So the number of fixed colorings is 3 (for T=F=R) × 3 (for Bot=B=L) = 9.

Each vertex rotation (120° and 240°) contributes 9 fixed colorings. There are eight such rotations (four axes, each with two rotations: 120° and 240°).

So now, let's sum up all the fixed colorings:

- Identity: 1 × 729 = 729.

- Face rotations (90° and 270°): 6 rotations × 27 = 162.

- Face rotations (180°): 3 rotations × 81 = 243.

- Edge rotations (180°): 6 rotations × 27 = 162.

- Vertex rotations (120° and 240°): 8 rotations × 9 = 72.

Now, add them all up:

729 (identity) + 162 (face 90/270) + 243 (face 180) + 162 (edge 180) + 72 (vertex) = 

Let me calculate step by step:

729 + 162 = 891.

891 + 243 = 1134.

1134 + 162 = 1296.

1296 + 72 = 1368.

Now, according to Burnside's lemma, the number of distinct colorings is the total fixed colorings divided by the order of the group, which is 24.

So 1368 ÷ 24 = ?

Let me compute that:

24 × 57 = 1368, because 24 × 50 = 1200, 24 ×7=168; 1200+168=1368.

So 1368 ÷24=57.

Wait, that's one of the options. Looking back at the options:

A:81, B:45, C:60, D:36, E:57, F:63, G:100, H:27, I:90, J:72.

So the answer is E:57.
</think>

To determine the number of distinct ways to color the faces of a cube with three colors up to rotation, we use Burnside's lemma. The cube has 24 rotational symmetries, and we calculate the number of colorings fixed by each symmetry:

1. **Identity rotation (1 element):** Fixes all 3⁶ = 729 colorings.

2. **90° and 270° rotations about face axes (6 elements):** Each rotation fixes 3³ = 27 colorings.

3. **180° rotations about face axes (3 elements):** Each rotation fixes 3⁴ = 81 colorings.

4. **180° rotations about edge axes (6 elements):** Each rotation fixes 3³ = 27 colorings.

5. **120° and 240° rotations about vertex axes (8 elements):** Each rotation fixes 3² = 9 colorings.

Summing the fixed colorings:
- Identity: 729
- Face rotations (90°, 270°): 6 × 27 = 162
- Face rotations (180°): 3 × 81 = 243
- Edge rotations (180°): 6 × 27 = 162
- Vertex rotations (120°, 240°): 8 × 9 = 72

Total fixed colorings = 729 + 162 + 243 + 162 + 72 = 1368.

Applying Burnside's lemma:
\[
\text{Distinct colorings} = \frac{\text{Total fixed colorings}}{\text{Order of the group}} = \frac{1368}{24} = 57.
\]
