Okay, so I have this question about the diffusion rates of inert gases—Ar, He, and Kr—under standard temperature and pressure. I'm a bit rusty on my gas laws, but I'll try to think it through.

I remember that the rate of diffusion of gases is related to their molar masses. The lighter the gas, the faster it diffuses. I think it's Graham's law that talks about this. Graham's law states that the rate of effusion (which is similar to diffusion) is inversely proportional to the square root of the molar mass. So the formula is Rate ∝ 1/√(Molar Mass). 

Let me jot down the molar masses of each gas. Argon (Ar) has a molar mass of about 39.95 g/mol, Helium (He) is much lighter at 4.0026 g/mol, and Krypton (Kr) is around 83.798 g/mol. So He is the lightest, then Ar, then Kr.

Wait, no. Wait, He is much lighter than Ar and Kr. So their rates should be in the order He > Ar > Kr. Because the lighter the gas, the higher the rate.

So the rates should be highest for He, then Ar, then Kr. So when looking at the options, the rates should be in that order, with He having the largest value, Ar next, Kr the smallest.

Now, let me look at the options to find which one fits this pattern. Each option lists three numbers, presumably the rates for Ar, He, Kr. Wait, no—the question says "the relative rates at which inert gases, Ar, He, and Kr diffuse." Wait, does that mean the order is Ar, He, Kr? So the numbers in each option are for Ar, He, Kr. So the order in each triplet is Ar:He:Kr.

Wait, but wait, the options are presented as A to J, each with three numbers. For example, option A is 0.1002 : 0.3002 : 0.4002. So I think the first number is Ar, the second He, third Kr? Or maybe the other way around. Wait, no, the question says 'the relative rates at which inert gases, Ar, He, and Kr diffuse.' So the order in the triplet is Ar, then He, then Kr. So in each option, the first number is Ar's rate, second He's, third Kr's.

So, for example, option B is 0.3582 : 0.4582 : 0.0582. Hmm. Let's see. Wait, that would mean Ar's rate is 0.3582, He's 0.4582, Kr's 0.0582. That makes sense because He is faster than Ar, which is faster than Kr. So He's rate is higher, Kr's lower. That aligns with the expected He > Ar > Kr.

Wait, but wait. Let me check each option to see which fits the expected order.

Option A: 0.1002 : 0.3002 : 0.4002. So He is 0.3002, Ar is 0.1002, Kr is 0.4002. That can't be right because Kr is heavier than Ar, so Kr should have a lower rate than Ar. But here Kr's rate is higher than Ar's. So this is incorrect.

Option B: 0.3582 : 0.4582 : 0.0582. So He is 0.4582 (highest), Ar is 0.3582, Kr is 0.0582 (lowest). That makes sense. He is fastest, then Ar, then Kr. So this might be correct.

Option C: 0.2582 : 0.4998 : 0.3092. He is highest, then Kr is higher than Ar? Because 0.3092 is Kr, which is higher than Ar's 0.2582. That's incorrect because Kr should be lower than Ar. So this is wrong.

Option D: 0.1582 : 0.6008 : 0.2092. He is highest, Ar is 0.1582, Kr is 0.2092. So Kr's rate is higher than Ar's, which is wrong because Kr is heavier. So D is incorrect.

Option E: 0.1582 : 0.4998 : 0.1092. He is highest (0.4998), Ar is 0.1582, Kr is 0.1092. That's correct because He > Ar > Kr. But wait, the numbers: He is about 3.16 times faster than Ar, which aligns with the square roots. Let me think about the actual molar masses.

Wait, using Graham's law, the rate ratio is inversely proportional to the square root of molar mass. So Rate ∝ 1/√M.

Let's compute the square roots:

He: 4.0026 → sqrt ≈ 2.00065
Ar: 39.95 → sqrt ≈ 6.321
Kr: 83.798 → sqrt ≈ 9.154

So the rates should be inversely proportional to these. So the rate ratios would be:

He rate : Ar rate : Kr rate = 1/2.00065 : 1/6.321 : 1/9.154 ≈ 0.4998 : 0.1582 : 0.1092.

Wait, but wait, that's if we're taking the inverse. So if He is the fastest, the ratios would be He : Ar : Kr = 1/2 : 1/6.321 : 1/9.154 ≈ 0.5 : 0.158 : 0.109. So when multiplied by a common factor, say k, the rates would be in the order He > Ar > Kr.

So looking at option E: 0.1582 : 0.4998 : 0.1092. Wait, no, that can't be because He's rate is the second number. So in E, the order is Ar:He:Kr. Wait, no, earlier I thought the order is Ar, He, Kr. So in E, the first number is Ar's rate, second He's, third Kr's.

So E is Ar:0.1582, He:0.4998, Kr:0.1092. That fits He > Ar > Kr.

Wait, but looking back at the options, let me check:

Option E: .1582 : .4998 : .1092. So Ar is 0.1582, He 0.4998, Kr 0.1092. That's correct because He is higher than Ar, which is higher than Kr.

Wait, but earlier I thought option B also fit, but let me check the actual ratios. Let me compute the ratios based on molar masses.

The rate of diffusion is inversely proportional to sqrt(M). So the rates should be He : Ar : Kr = 1/sqrt(4) : 1/sqrt(40) : 1/sqrt(84).

Compute each:

He: 1/2 = 0.5

Ar: 1/sqrt(40) ≈ 1/6.3246 ≈ 0.1581

Kr: 1/sqrt(84) ≈ 1/9.165 ≈ 0.1090

So the rates should be He : Ar : Kr ≈ 0.5 : 0.1581 : 0.1090.

But the question is about the relative rates, so the actual values are not as important as the ratio.

Now, looking at the options, which triplet has the largest number for He, medium for Ar, and smallest for Kr.

Option E: 0.1582 (Ar), 0.4998 (He), 0.1092 (Kr). So that's Ar:0.1582, He:0.4998, Kr:0.1092. So the ratios are He is about 3.16 times Ar (since 0.4998 / 0.1582 ≈ 3.16), which is the square of 1.778, which is close to sqrt(3.16) ≈ 1.778, but wait, actually, 3.16 is (approx) (2^2), since 2 is sqrt(4), so the ratios are as expected.

Wait, but looking at option E, the first number is Ar's rate, which is 0.1582, He is 0.4998, Kr is 0.1092. So the order is He > Ar > Kr, which is correct.

Wait, but earlier I thought option B was correct, but I might have made a mistake.

Option B: 0.3582 : 0.4582 : 0.0582. So Ar:0.3582, He:0.4582, Kr:0.0582. So He is higher than Ar, which is higher than Kr. That's correct, but the numbers don't align with the expected ratios.

Wait, according to the molar mass ratios, He should be about 3.16 times faster than Ar. So if Ar's rate is 0.1582, He's should be around 0.4998, which is exactly what option E has. So option E is correct.

Wait, but earlier I thought option B might be correct, but I think I was confused. Let me double-check.

Yes, option E's numbers match the expected ratios. So the correct answer should be option E.
</think>

The relative diffusion rates of inert gases are inversely proportional to the square roots of their molar masses, as per Graham's law. Helium (He) has the lowest molar mass, so it diffuses the fastest. Argon (Ar) is heavier than He but lighter than Krypton (Kr), so it diffuses at a medium rate. Krypton, being the heaviest, diffuses the slowest. Among the options, only option E correctly reflects this order with the rates for Ar, He, and Kr as 0.1582, 0.4998, and 0.1092, respectively.

Answer: E
