Question:

Which of the following explanations best fits the fallacy of ignorance of refutation?

Options:

A: asserting an argumentative opponent has taken an easily defeated position, which the opponent has not really taken, defeating the position, and acting as if you've done significant damage to that person's overall argument.
B: causing confusion during refutation because of a real or feigned lack of the ability to engage in refutation
C: characterizing an opposing argument in such a way to make it or its consequences appear to be ridiculous
D: arguing an action should be taken based only on the need to be loyal to someone or to a group

Alright, I'm trying to figure out which explanation best fits the fallacy of ignorance of refutation. Let's break it down.

First, I need to understand what "ignorance of refutation" means. From what I remember, a fallacy is a mistake in reasoning. Ignorant usually means being unaware or uninformed, so "ignorance of refutation" likely involves not knowing or ignoring how to properly refute an argument.

Looking at the options:

Option A: This talks about an opponent taking an easily defeated position they haven't actually taken. So, the arguer defeats a straw man version, thinking they've done significant damage. That sounds like a straw man fallacy, not necessarily about ignoring refutation.

Option B: This is about causing confusion because the person can't engage in refutation, either because they lack ability or pretend to. This seems more about avoiding actual engagement, which might relate to the fallacy because if you can't refute properly, you might misrepresent the argument or avoid it.

Option C: Characterizing an opposing argument to make it look ridiculous. That's the ad absurdum fallacy, I think. It's about making the argument seem silly, not about ignoring how to refute it.

Option D: Arguing based on loyalty rather than evidence. That's more about appeal to emotion or authority, not refutation.

So, the fallacy of ignorance of refutation probably involves someone who doesn't engage properly with the opponent's argument. They might misrepresent it or avoid addressing it, perhaps because they don't know how. Option B says the person can't engage, causing confusion, which fits the idea of ignoring how to refute. Alternatively, Option A is about attacking a position the opponent hasn't taken, which is a straw man.

Wait, but the question is about the fallacy of ignoring the refutation. So, maybe it's when someone doesn't address the actual argument because they don't know how, leading them to either misrepresent it or avoid it. That aligns with Option B, where the confusion arises from a lack of engagement.

Alternatively, maybe it's when someone presents a weak version of the opponent's argument to easily refute it, which is what Option A describes. But that's more the straw man fallacy.

I'm a bit confused now. Let me think again. Ignorance of refutation would mean the arguer doesn't properly refute the opponent's point. So, they might either not address it at all, or misrepresent it as an easy target. So, Option A is about misrepresenting the opponent's position to defeat it easily, which is a straw man, not exactly ignoring refutation.

Option B is about causing confusion because they can't engage. Maybe that's a better fit for the fallacy, as they're ignoring the proper way to refute by being unable or unwilling to do so, leading to confusion.

Wait, another angle: the fallacy of ignoring refutation could mean that the arguer doesn't consider possible counterarguments. So, they don't refute at all, perhaps because they're unaware of how to do it. That would fit with Option B, where they can't engage properly, leading to confusion.

I think I'm leaning towards Option B as the best fit.

The fallacy of ignorance of refutation involves failing to properly address or refute an opponent's argument, often due to a lack of understanding or ability. Among the options, B best captures this by describing how confusion arises from a real or feigned inability to engage in refutation.

Answer: B
