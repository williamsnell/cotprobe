Question:

What are the implications of the Hardy-Weinberg Law?

Options:

A: The Hardy-Weinberg Law only applies to small, isolated populations
B: The Hardy-Weinberg Law assumes that mating is non-random and typically assortative based on genotype.
C: The Hardy-Weinberg Law predicts that all alleles will eventually reach an equal frequency in a stable population.
D: The Hardy-Weinberg Law indicates that natural selection cannot occur in real populations.
E: The Hardy-Weinberg Law suggests that mutation rates are the primary driver of evolution in large populations.
F: The Hardy-Weinberg Law implies that genetic drift has a negligible effect on allele frequencies.
G: The Hardy-Weinberg Law states that gene frequencies change from generation to generation
H: The Hardy-Weinberg Law applies strictly to populations with a high rate of gene flow and migration.
I: The Hardy-Weinberg Law states that in a population at equilibrium, both gene and genotype frequencies remain constant from generation to generation.
J: The Hardy-Weinberg Law predicts the extinction of recessive genes over time

Okay, so I have this question about the Hardy-Weinberg Law and its implications. I'm a bit rusty on my genetics, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that the Hardy-Weinberg Law is a fundamental principle in population genetics. It basically gives us an idea of how allele and genotype frequencies change in a population. The law states that in a population meeting certain conditions, these frequencies will remain constant from generation to generation.

Wait, what are those conditions again? I think they include things like no mutation, random mating, no gene flow, a large population size, and no natural selection. Oh right, because if any of these factors are present, they can cause changes in allele frequencies, which would violate the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.

So the question is asking about the implications of this law. Let's look at the options.

Option A: The Hardy-Weinberg Law only applies to small, isolated populations. Hmm, I don't think that's right. Because the law applies when certain conditions are met, regardless of population size. In fact, small populations might not meet the conditions because of genetic drift and other factors, but the law itself isn't limited to small populations. So A is probably incorrect.

Option B: The law assumes non-random mating. Wait, no, the opposite. The Hardy-Weinberg model assumes random mating. If mating is non-random (like assortative), the model doesn't hold. So B is wrong.

Option C: Predicts all alleles will reach equal frequency. No, that's not what the law says. The law says that frequencies will stay the same if the conditions are met, but it doesn't predict that they'll equalize. They might not be equal to begin with. So C is incorrect.

Option D: Indicates natural selection can't occur. That's not true. The law assumes no natural selection. So if natural selection is happening, the population isn't in H-W equilibrium. But the law doesn't say selection can't occur; it just says under its assumptions, selection isn't a factor. So D is wrong.

Option E: Mutation rates drive evolution. The H-W law ignores mutation rates because it assumes no mutation. So E is incorrect; the law doesn't talk about mutation as the main driver.

Option F: Genetic drift has a negligible effect. Well, genetic drift is a factor that can change allele frequencies, especially in small populations. The H-W law assumes no drift. So if there's drift, the law doesn't hold. But F says the law implies that drift has a negligible effect. Actually, the law assumes it doesn't happen, but in reality, drift does affect populations. So F is not correct.

Option G: States that gene frequencies change from generation to generation. Wait, no. The law says that if certain conditions are met, frequencies remain constant. So G is incorrect because the law implies no change under its conditions.

Option H: Applies to populations with high gene flow. The H-W law applies when there's no gene flow. So H is wrong. High gene flow would violate the assumption.

Option I: States that in equilibrium, both gene and genotype frequencies remain constant. Yes, that's exactly what the law states. When a population is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the allele and genotype frequencies don't change from generation to generation. So I is correct.

Option J: Predicts extinction of recessive genes. No, the law doesn't predict that. Recessive genes can stay in the population as carriers. They won't go extinct unless certain conditions cause it, but the law itself doesn't say that. So J is incorrect.

So putting it all together, the correct answer is I.

The Hardy-Weinberg Law provides a framework for understanding allele and genotype frequencies in populations under specific conditions. The law states that these frequencies will remain constant from generation to generation if there is no mutation, random mating, no gene flow, a large population size, and no natural selection. Among the options provided, the correct implication is that in a population at equilibrium, both gene and genotype frequencies remain constant. 

Answer: I
