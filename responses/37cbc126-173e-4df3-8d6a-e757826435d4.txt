Okay, so I've got this question about E. coli cells and ribosomes. Hmm, let's see what it's asking. I'll try to break it down step by step.

The question says there are about 25,000 ribosomes in an E. coli cell. The structural proteins of these ribosomes are to be stretched out end to end as fully extended polypeptide chains. I need to find out how many times this long chain could encircle the E. coli cell. 

So, first, I should figure out the total length of all the proteins from the ribosomes. Then, I'll find out the circumference of the E. coli cell and see how many times the protein length fits into that circumference.

Let's start by gathering the given data:

- Number of ribosomes: 25,000
- Ribosome diameter: 180 Ångströms (which is 180 x 10^-10 meters)
- Specific gravity of ribosomes: 1.0 (but I'm not sure how this is relevant yet)
- Percentage of protein in ribosomes: 40%
- E. coli cell diameter: 1 micrometer (1e-6 meters)

Wait, so I'm dealing with proteins in the ribosomes. Each ribosome has some protein, but only 40% of its mass is protein. So, I need to calculate the total protein mass, then find out how much that protein contributes in length when stretched out.

But wait, proteins are made of amino acids, and each amino acid contributes a certain length when the protein is stretched out. However, I don't have the molecular weight of the proteins, so maybe I should approach it differently. Alternatively, perhaps I can calculate the volume of the proteins and then relate that to the length when stretched.

Wait, another approach: since each ribosome has a certain diameter, maybe the volume of a single ribosome can help me find out the volume of protein in it, then find the total length when all proteins are stretched.

Wait, but perhaps it's better to think in terms of the mass of the proteins. So, let's see:

Each ribosome's mass can be calculated from its volume and specific gravity. The specific gravity is 1.0, meaning it's the same as water. So, the density is 1 g/cm³.

First, calculate the volume of a single ribosome. Since it's a sphere, volume is (4/3)πr³. The diameter is 180 Å, so radius is 90 Å, which is 90e-10 meters or 9e-9 meters. Wait, wait, 1 Å is 1e-10 meters, so 180 Å is 180e-10 m, so radius is 90e-10 m.

So, volume V = (4/3)π*(90e-10)^3.

But wait, maybe it's easier to convert to centimeters because density is in g/cm³. Let's convert the radius to cm. 1 m = 100 cm, so 90e-10 meters is 90e-10 * 100 cm = 9e-8 cm. Wait, no: 1 meter is 100 cm, so 1e-10 m is 1e-8 cm. So 90e-10 m is 90e-10 * 100 cm = 9e-8 cm? Wait that doesn't make sense. Wait, wait, 1 m = 1e2 cm, so 1e-10 m = 1e-10 * 1e2 cm = 1e-8 cm. So 90e-10 m is 90e-10 * 1e2 cm = 9e-8 cm. So radius r = 9e-8 cm.

So volume V = (4/3)π*(9e-8 cm)^3.

Compute that:

V = (4/3) * π * (729e-24) cm³ ≈ (4/3) * 3.1416 * 729e-24 ≈ 4 * 3.1416 * 243e-24 ≈ let's compute 4 * 3.1416 ≈ 12.5664. Then multiply by 243e-24: 12.5664 * 243e-24 ≈ 3,053e-24 cm³, which is 3.053e-21 cm³.

Wait, maybe I should calculate it more accurately. Let me compute (9e-8)^3: 9^3 is 729, so (9e-8)^3 = 729e-24 cm³. Multiply by 4/3 π: 729e-24 * (4/3)*π ≈ 729e-24 * 4.1888 ≈ 729 * 4.1888 ≈ let's see, 700*4.1888 is about 2932.16, and 29*4.1888≈121.475, so total about 3053.635e-24 cm³, which is 3.053635e-21 cm³.

So each ribosome's volume is approximately 3.05e-21 cm³. Since specific gravity is 1.0, the mass is equal to the volume in grams, because density (g/cm³) is 1.0 g/cm³. So mass of one ribosome is 3.05e-21 grams.

But only 40% of that mass is protein. So the protein mass per ribosome is 0.4 * 3.05e-21 g = 1.22e-21 grams.

Now, the total number of ribosomes is 25,000, so total protein mass is 25,000 * 1.22e-21 g = 3.05e-17 grams.

Wait, that seems really small. Let me double-check the steps so far.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in units. Let me go back. The diameter is 180 Å, which is 180e-10 meters. Converting that to centimeters, since 1 m = 100 cm, 180e-10 m = 180e-10 * 100 cm = 18e-8 cm. So radius is 9e-8 cm, correct.

Volume calculation: (4/3)π*(9e-8)^3. Yes, correct. So 9e-8 cubed is 729e-24 cm³. Multiply by 4/3 π: yes, 4/3 π is about 4.1888. So 729e-24 * 4.1888 ≈ 3.05e-21 cm³ per ribosome.

Mass per ribosome: 3.05e-21 grams (since density is 1 g/cm³). Protein mass is 40% of that: 0.4 * 3.05e-21 ≈ 1.22e-21 grams per ribosome.

Total protein mass: 25,000 * 1.22e-21 g = 3.05e-17 grams.

Wait, but wait, 25,000 is 2.5e4. So 2.5e4 * 1.22e-21 = 3.05e-17 g. That's 3.05e-17 grams total.

Now, the next step: how long would all that protein be when stretched out as a polypeptide chain?

Proteins are made of amino acids, each contributing a certain length. The average length per amino acid can be approximated. Let's think: the length of a polypeptide chain is roughly the number of amino acids multiplied by the length per amino acid.

Each amino acid is typically about 10-15 Angstroms in length when in a chain. Let's take an average of 12 Å per amino acid for simplicity, but I'll have to check if that's a reasonable assumption.

So, first, find the total number of amino acids in all the proteins.

Total protein mass is 3.05e-17 grams. The average molecular weight of an amino acid is about 110 g/mol (I remember that the average is around there, maybe a bit higher). So, the number of moles of protein is mass divided by molecular weight.

Number of moles = 3.05e-17 g / 110 g/mol ≈ 2.77e-19 mol.

Each mole has Avogadro's number of molecules, 6.022e23. So the total number of amino acids is 2.77e-19 mol * 6.022e23 molecules/mol ≈ 1.67e5 amino acids.

Wait, that's 167,000 amino acids in total.

Each amino acid contributes about 12 Å to the length, so total length L = 1.67e5 * 12e-10 meters.

Wait, 12 Å is 12e-10 meters. So:

L = 1.67e5 * 12e-10 m = 2.004e-5 meters.

Wait, that's 2.004e-5 meters, which is 2.004e-5 * 1e6 micrometers, which is 20.04 micrometers.

But wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check the calculations again.

Wait, let's recalculate the number of amino acids:

Total protein mass = 3.05e-17 grams.

Average molecular weight per amino acid: 110 g/mol.

Number of moles = 3.05e-17 / 110 ≈ 2.77e-19 mol.

Number of amino acids = 2.77e-19 * 6.022e23 ≈ 1.67e5.

Yes, that's correct. So 167,000 amino acids.

Each amino acid contributes about 10 Å on average, so let's take 10e-10 meters per amino acid.

Wait, perhaps I should use a more precise value. The length between two adjacent amino acids in a polypeptide chain is roughly the size of the alpha-carbon, which is about 3-4 Å, but when considering the entire side chain, it's more like 10-15 Å. Let me go with an average of 12 Å as I did before.

So L = 1.67e5 amino * 12e-10 m/a.a. = 2.004e-5 meters, which is 20.04 micrometers.

Wait, but wait, 1e-5 meters is 10 micrometers. So 2.004e-5 m is 20.04 micrometers.

Now, the E. coli cell is a sphere with a diameter of 1 micrometer, so its circumference is π * diameter = π * 1e-6 m ≈ 3.1416e-6 meters, which is 3.1416 micrometers.

So the total length of the protein chain is 20.04 micrometers.

How many times can this chain encircle the cell? That's the total length divided by the circumference of the cell.

Number of times N = 20.04 micrometers / 3.1416 micrometers ≈ 6.38 times.

Wait, that's only about 6 times. But the answer options are all in the order of 1e4 times, which is way higher than 6. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Hmm, where did I go wrong? Let me retrace.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the number of amino acids. Let me recheck.

Total protein mass is 3.05e-17 grams.

If each amino acid is, say, 110 g/mol, then number of moles is 3.05e-17 / 110 = 2.77e-19 mol.

Number of amino acids = 2.77e-19 * 6.022e23 ≈ 1.67e5. That seems correct.

Wait, but maybe the length per amino acid is much longer than 12 Å. Alternatively, perhaps I miscalculated the protein mass.

Wait, wait another thought: the volume of the ribosome is 3.05e-21 cm³, which is 3.05e-21 * 1e6 μL (since 1 cm³ is 1e6 μL), but maybe that's not relevant.

Wait, perhaps I confused grams with something else. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the calculation of the volume of the ribosome. Let me redo that.

Volume V = (4/3)πr³, where r is 9e-8 cm (since 90 Å = 9e-8 cm? Wait, no, wait, 1 Å is 1e-8 cm. Because 1 m = 100 cm, so 1e-10 m = 1e-8 cm. So 90 Å is 90e-10 m = 9e-9 m. Wait, but when converting to cm, 9e-9 m = 9e-9 * 100 cm = 9e-7 cm. So radius r = 9e-8 cm? Wait, no, that's not right. Let me compute it correctly.

Wait, 1 meter is 100 centimeters, so 1e-10 meters is 1e-10 * 100 cm = 1e-8 cm. So 180 Å is 180e-10 m = 180e-8 cm. So diameter is 180e-8 cm, so radius is 90e-8 cm = 9e-7 cm. Wait, no: 180e-8 cm is the diameter, so radius is 90e-8 cm = 9e-7 cm.

Wait, I think I messed up the earlier conversion. Let me correct that.

So radius r = 90e-8 cm. Because 180 Å is 180e-10 meters, which is 180e-8 cm. So radius is half that, so 90e-8 cm.

So volume V = (4/3)π*(90e-8 cm)^3.

Compute (90e-8)^3: 90^3 is 729,000. So (90e-8)^3 = 729,000e-24 cm³ = 7.29e5 * 1e-24 cm³ = 7.29e-19 cm³.

Wait, that's 7.29e-19 cm³ per ribosome.

So the volume of each ribosome is 7.29e-19 cm³. Since density is 1 g/cm³, mass is volume in grams: 7.29e-19 grams per ribosome.

Protein mass per ribosome is 40% of that: 0.4 * 7.29e-19 = 2.916e-19 grams.

Total protein mass for 25,000 ribosomes: 25,000 * 2.916e-19 g = 7.29e-15 grams.

Wait, that's 7.29e-15 grams. That's 7.29e-15 g.

Wait, that's 7.29e-15 grams. Now, converting to kilograms would be 7.29e-18 kg, but I think grams are fine here.

Now, number of moles of protein: mass / molecular weight. Let's take 110 g/mol as before.

Number of moles = 7.29e-15 g / 110 g/mol ≈ 6.627e-17 mol.

Number of amino acids: 6.627e-17 mol * 6.022e23 molecules/mol ≈ 3.99e7 amino acids.

Wait, that's 39,900,000 amino acids. That's a lot more than before. So earlier I had 1.67e5, but now it's 3.99e7. So I must have made a mistake in the volume calculation earlier.

Wait, yes, I see where I went wrong. Earlier, I thought the radius was 9e-8 cm, but it's actually 90e-8 cm (since 90 Å is 90e-10 m = 90e-8 cm). So the volume calculation was wrong before. Now, with the correct volume, the protein mass comes out to 7.29e-15 grams instead of 3.05e-17 grams.

So with the corrected volume, let's proceed.

Number of amino acids: 3.99e7.

Each amino acid contributes about 10 Å to the length, so total length L = 3.99e7 * 10e-10 m/a.a. = 3.99e7 * 1e-9 m = 3.99e-2 m, which is 39.9 millimeters.

Wait, 39.9 mm is 39,900 micrometers.

Now, the E. coli cell has a diameter of 1 micrometer, so its circumference is π * 1e-6 m = approximately 3.1416e-6 meters, which is 3.1416 micrometers.

So the number of times the protein chain can encircle the cell is L / circumference.

N = 39,900 micrometers / 3.1416 micrometers ≈ 12,700 times.

Looking at the options, option E is 1.76e4, which is 17,600, and option I is 1.0e4, option J is 2.0e4.

Wait, my calculation gives around 12,700, which is approximately 1.27e4. Let me check the options again:

Options:

A: 2.10 ×10^4
B: 1.26 ×10^4
C: 0.80 ×10^4
D:3.50 ×10^4
E:1.76 ×10^4
F:3.00 ×10^4
G:4.00 ×10^4
H:2.54 ×10^4
I:1.00 ×10^4
J:2.00 ×10^4

Wait, 12,700 is 1.27e4, which is very close to option B: 1.26 ×10^4.

Hmm, perhaps I made a slight miscalculation. Let me redo the steps with more precise numbers.

Let me recalculate the number of amino acids:

Total protein mass: 7.29e-15 grams.

Number of moles = 7.29e-15 g / 110 g/mol = 6.627e-17 mol.

Number of amino acids = 6.627e-17 mol * 6.022e23 = 6.627e-17 * 6.022e23 = let's compute:

6.627 * 6.022 ≈ 39.9 (since 6 *6=36, 0.627*6=3.762, 6*0.022=0.132, 0.627*0.022≈0.0138; total approx 36 +3.762 +0.132 +0.0138 ≈ 39.907).

So 39.907e6 amino acids, approximately 3.99e7.

Each amino acid is 10 Å: 10e-10 m.

So total length L = 3.99e7 * 10e-10 m = 3.99e-3 m = 3.99 mm.

Wait, wait, that can't be right. Wait, 3.99e7 * 10e-10 m = 3.99e-3 meters, which is 3.99 mm. Hmm, but earlier I thought it was 39.9 mm, which would be 3.99 cm, but that's wrong. Wait, no, 3.99e-3 meters is 3.99 millimeters. Wait, I think I made a mistake in the exponent.

Wait, 3.99e7 amino acids * 10e-10 m/a.a. = 3.99e7 * 1e-9 m = 3.99e-2 m, which is 39.9 mm. Wait, no, 1e-9 m is 1 nm, so 10e-10 m is 1e-9 m.

Wait, 3.99e7 * 1e-9 m = 3.99e-2 m, which is 39.9 mm. Oh, okay, that's correct.

Now, the E. coli cell's circumference is π * d = π * 1e-6 m = 3.1416e-6 m, which is 3.1416 micrometers.

So the number of times the chain can wrap around is L / circumference.

L is 39.9 mm = 39,900 micrometers.

Circumference is ~3.1416 micrometers.

So N = 39,900 / 3.1416 ≈ 12,700 times, which is 1.27e4.

Looking at the options, option B is 1.26e4, which is very close. So I think the correct answer is B.
</think>

To determine how many times the structural proteins of 25,000 ribosomes in an E. coli cell could encircle the cell when stretched out, the following steps were taken:

1. **Volume of a Single Ribosome**:  
   The ribosome is assumed to be spherical with a diameter of 180 Å (180 × 10⁻¹⁰ m). The radius is 90 Å, or 9 × 10⁻¹⁰ m. Converting to centimeters (1 m = 100 cm), the radius is 9 × 10⁻⁸ cm.  
   The volume of a sphere is given by:  
   \[
   V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3
   \]  
   Substituting \( r = 9 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{cm} \):  
   \[
   V = \frac{4}{3} \pi (9 \times 10^{-8})^3 = \frac{4}{3} \pi (729 \times 10^{-24}) \approx 3.05 \times 10^{-21} \, \text{cm}^3
   \]

2. **Mass of a Single Ribosome**:  
   The specific gravity of the ribosome is 1.0 g/cm³, so its mass equals its volume in grams:  
   \[
   \text{Mass of one ribosome} = 3.05 \times 10^{-21} \, \text{g}
   \]  
   Since 40% of the ribosome's mass is protein:  
   \[
   \text{Protein mass per ribosome} = 0.4 \times 3.05 \times 10^{-21} = 1.22 \times 10^{-21} \, \text{g}
   \]

3. **Total Protein Mass**:  
   With 25,000 ribosomes:  
   \[
   \text{Total protein mass} = 25,000 \times 1.22 \times 10^{-21} = 3.05 \times 10^{-17} \, \text{g}
   \]

4. **Number of Amino Acids**:  
   Assuming an average molecular weight of 110 g/mol for amino acids:  
   \[
   \text{Moles of protein} = \frac{3.05 \times 10^{-17} \, \text{g}}{110 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 2.77 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{mol}
   \]  
   Using Avogadro's number (\( 6.022 \times 10^{23} \, \text{molecules/mol} \)):  
   \[
   \text{Total amino acids} = 2.77 \times 10^{-19} \times 6.022 \times 10^{23} \approx 1.67 \times 10^5
   \]

5. **Total Length of the Protein Chain**:  
   Assuming each amino acid contributes 12 Å (12 × 10⁻¹⁰ m) to the length:  
   \[
   \text{Total length} = 1.67 \times 10^5 \times 12 \times 10^{-10} = 2.004 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{m} = 20.04 \, \mu\text{m}
   \]

6. **Circumference of the E. coli Cell**:  
   The cell is a sphere with a diameter of 1 μm, so its circumference is:  
   \[
   C = \pi d = \pi \times 1 \, \mu\text{m} \approx 3.1416 \, \mu\text{m}
   \]

7. **Number of Encirclements**:  
   The number of times the protein chain can encircle the cell is:  
   \[
   N = \frac{\text{Total length}}{\text{Circumference}} = \frac{20.04 \, \mu\text{m}}{3.1416 \, \mu\text{m}} \approx 6.38
   \]

However, recalculating with corrected values for the ribosome's volume and protein mass yielded a total protein length of approximately 39.9 mm (39,900 μm). Dividing this by the cell's circumference (~3.1416 μm) gives:  
\[
N = \frac{39,900 \, \mu\text{m}}{3.1416 \, \mu\text{m}} \approx 12,700 \, \text{times} = 1.27 \times 10^4
\]

This value aligns closely with option **B: 1.26 × 10⁴**.

**Answer:** B
