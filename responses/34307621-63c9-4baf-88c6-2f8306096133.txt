Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about the Upper Paleolithic period and what indicates advancements in human intellect. Hmm, let me think about what I remember from my studies. The Upper Paleolithic is known for a bunch of significant developments, right? I'm trying to recall the key points.

The question is asking which option most strongly indicates advances in human intellect. So I'm looking for something that shows increased cognitive abilities or creativity. Let me go through the options one by one.

Option A: Construction of permanent dwellings. I think that's more associated with the Neolithic period, when people started farming and settled down. But the Upper Paleolithic was still a time of hunter-gatherers, so maybe they didn't build permanent homes. Not sure, but I think this might not be the best choice.

Option B: Invention of the wheel. Wait, the wheel was invented much later, like in the Bronze Age, right? So that's probably not Upper Paleolithic. They were using stone tools, not wheels for transportation.

Option C: Parietal and mobiliary art. Oh, right! This refers to cave paintings and portable art like carved figures. The Upper Paleolithic is famous for things like the Lascaux cave paintings in France. This definitely shows advanced thinking, creativity, and symbolic behavior, which are indicators of intellectual advancement. This seems like a strong candidate.

Option D: Creation of writing systems. Writing came much later too, like in the Bronze Age or even later. The Upper Paleolithic people didn't have writing; they used symbols and art, not written language. So this isn't it.

Option E: Development of pottery. Pottery started in the Neolithic as well, I think. Maybe some early forms in the late Upper Paleolithic, but it's not the most definitive sign of intellect compared to art.

Option F: Domestication of plants and animals. That's the Neolithic Revolution again, so not Upper Paleolithic.

Option G: New stone-tool technologies. Upper Paleolithic is known for tools like the Aurignacian, Gravettian, and Solutrean industries, which were more advanced than earlier stone tools. But is this the strongest indicator of intellect? While tool use is important, maybe the art is a better indicator of abstract thinking.

Option H: Acquisition of non-local raw materials. This shows some trade or planning, but I'm not sure if it's the strongest indicator of intellect compared to art.

Option I: Increased use of fire. Early humans had controlled use of fire, but this was probably established earlier, so maybe not the peak of Upper Paleolithic advancements.

Option J: Changes in settlement patterns. Again, more associated with the shift towards settled life in the Neolithic, so perhaps not the best fit.

So, putting it all together, the invention of advanced stone tools (G) is a big deal and shows technical skills, but parietal and mobiliary art (C) seems to best represent a leap in cognitive abilities, like abstract thought and symbolic expression. So I think C is the best answer.

The Upper Paleolithic period is marked by significant advancements in human intellect, particularly evidenced by the development of art. Parietal and mobiliary art, such as cave paintings and portable sculptures, reflects a capacity for abstract thought, creativity, and symbolic expression, which are strong indicators of intellectual progress. While other options like new stone-tool technologies (G) and changes in settlement patterns (J) are notable, they are either less directly tied to intellectual advancement or more associated with later periods. Therefore, the most indicative achievement is the creation of art.

Answer: C
