The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

This question refers to the following information.
"We have witnessed for more than a quarter of a century the struggles of the two great political parties for power and plunder, while grievous wrongs have been inflicted upon the suffering people. We charge that the controlling influences dominating both these parties have permitted the existing dreadful conditions to develop without serious effort to prevent or restrain them. Neither do they now promise us any substantial reform. They have agreed together to ignore, in the coming campaign, every issue but one. They propose to drown the outcries of a plundered people with the uproar of a sham battle over the tariff, so that capitalists, corporations, national banks, rings, trusts, watered stock, the demonetization of silver and the oppressions of the usurers may all be lost sight of. They propose to sacrifice our homes, lives, and children on the altar of mammon; to destroy the multitude in order to secure corruption funds from the millionaires.
"Assembled on the anniversary of the birthday of the nation, and filled with the spirit of the grand general and chief who established our independence, we seek to restore the government of the Republic to the hands of 'the plain people,' with which class it originated. We assert our purposes to be identical with the purposes of the National Constitution; to form a more perfect union and establish justice, insure domestic tranquillity, provide for the common defence, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty for ourselves and our posterity."

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which option best explains why the Populist Party was successful in 1892. I remember that the Populist movement, especially the Populist Party, was mainly a response to issues faced by farmers and rural people in the late 19th century. 

Looking at the platform they provided, it talks about the struggles of the two great political parties, which I think were the Democratic and Republican parties. They were blaming these parties for not addressing the problems of the people. The platform mentions things like economic exploitation, corporate greed, and the control by big banks and trusts. So, the Populists were against the concentration of wealth and power in the hands of a few.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: The gold standard. I'm not sure, but the Populists were against the gold standard because they wanted more money in circulation, which would help farmers pay off their debts. So, maybe the failure of the gold standard affected their success, but I'm not certain if it was the main cause.

Option B: The Great Depression of the 1890s. Wait, the Great Depression was in the 1930s, so that's way after 1892. So B is probably incorrect.

Option C: Rise of labor unions in the industrial North. The Populists did support labor, but their base was more in the South and West, especially among farmers. Labor unions were more in the North, so I'm not sure if that's the main cause of their success.

Option D: Prohibition movement. Prohibition was more about alcohol, and the Populists were involved in that, but I don't think that was their main issue. Their main focus was on economic reforms and fighting corporate power.

Option E: Westward migration slowing after the Civil War. I'm not sure about this. Slowed migration might affect the economy, but I don't recall it being a direct cause of the Populists' success.

Option F: Expansion of railroads in the West. Railroads did help in some ways, like transporting goods, but they were also controlled by big corporations, which the Populists opposed. So maybe railroad expansion led to more issues that the Populists addressed, contributing to their success.

Option G: Western farmers resisting mechanization and government interference. Mechanization was probably making farming more efficient, but maybe it also led to economic changes that hurt small farmers. If they resented this, they might have supported the Populists who wanted to regulate big businesses.

Option H: Growth of corporate power and banking interests inspired rural activists. This sounds directly related. The Populists were against the monopolies and banks, so if corporate power was growing, that would push rural people to seek political reform, aligning with the Populists.

Option I: Conservation and National Parks. That seems more like a later movement, maybe with the Progressive era or even later. The Populists focused more on economic issues than conservation.

Option J: Discontent with the Federal Reserve System. The Federal Reserve was established in 1913, so in 1892 it didn't exist yet. So J can't be correct.

So narrowing it down, the key issues were corporate power, banking interests, and economic problems facing farmers. The Populists were formed to address these. So option H says that the growth of corporate power and banking interests inspired rural activists to push for reform, which directly led to the Populists' success. That makes sense because the platform clearly talks about fighting against these big interests.

Wait, but what about option F, the railroads? The railroads were part of the corporate power they were opposing. So maybe F is a contributing factor, but H is more general about corporate power and banking, which seems broader and more directly tied to their platform.

So the most direct cause would be H: the growth of corporate power and banking interests inspired rural activists to lobby for political reform.

The Populist Party's success in 1892 was most directly caused by the growth of corporate power and banking interests, which inspired rural activists to push for political reform. The Populists focused on addressing issues like economic exploitation, corporate greed, and the concentration of wealth, as evident in their platform. While other factors like railroad expansion and mechanization played roles, the broader issue of corporate dominance was the key driver of their success.

Answer: H
