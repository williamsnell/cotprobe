Alright, I'm trying to figure out the correct answer to this multiple-choice question about evidence law, specifically regarding a defendant's ability to introduce evidence of their good character in a securities fraud trial. Let me break down the problem step by step.

The scenario is that a man is on trial for securities fraud and takes the stand to testify in his own defense. During direct examination, his attorney wants to present evidence of his good character. The prosecution objects, and we need to determine which statement is correct regarding this situation.

First, I remember that in criminal trials, the rules of evidence dictate when and how character evidence can be introduced. I think the Federal Rules of Evidence (FRE) are relevant here, especially FRE 405. I recall that under FRE 405(a), when a party offers evidence of a witness's character, they can do so by testimony about the witness's reputation or by testimony in the form of specific instances of the witness's conduct. However, this is when the character is being attacked or defended through a witness's testimony.

In this case, the defendant is the one testifying, so the defense attorney is trying to introduce evidence of the defendant's good character. But I also remember that there's a rule about when the defendant can introduce such evidence. I think it's related to whether the defendant has opened the door to character evidence by introducing it first.

Wait, no—that's more about the timing. Let me think again. For a defendant testifying in their own behalf, can they introduce evidence of their good character to show they wouldn't commit the crime charged? I believe that under FRE 405(b), a party may prove the contents of a character trait by introducing specific instances of conduct if the opposing party has attacked the character of the witness by introducing evidence or argument. So the defendant can't just bring up their good character out of the blue; the prosecution has to attack their character first.

In this question, the prosecution hasn't attacked the defendant's character yet. The defense attorney is offering evidence of good character during direct examination. The prosecution objects. So, the defendant is trying to introduce evidence of good character without the prosecution having done so first. I think the rule is that the defendant can't do that. They can only bring up specific instances if the prosecution has already attacked their character.

Looking at the options, let's go through them one by one.

Option A: The defendant may introduce evidence to show good moral character. Hmm, but I thought the defendant can't introduce evidence of good character unless the prosecution has attacked it first. So this might not be correct.

Option B: The defendant may not introduce evidence to show honesty because character evidence is inadmissible. Wait, that doesn't sound right. I think character evidence is admissible, but perhaps in certain circumstances. Maybe this option is incorrect because it's a blanket statement that it's inadmissible, which isn't the case.

Option C: The defendant may introduce evidence of his past good deeds. That sounds similar to specific instances of conduct, which is allowed under FRE 405(a) if the character is attacked. But if the prosecution hasn't attacked, can the defendant bring this up? I think not.

Option D: The defendant may introduce evidence to show honesty. Again, without the prosecution attacking first, the defendant can't introduce this.

Option E: The defendant may introduce evidence to show truthfulness. Truthfulness is a specific trait, but I'm not sure if that's allowed unless the prosecution has attacked first. I think the same rule applies as with honesty.

Option F: The defendant may not introduce evidence of truthfulness unless it is inquired into on cross-examination. Wait, if the defendant is testifying, maybe they can bring up their own truthfulness without the prosecution initiating the topic. But I'm not certain.

Option G: The defendant may not introduce evidence of good character unless the prosecution first attacks his character. This aligns with what I was thinking earlier—it's about whether the prosecution has attacked the character first. So the defendant can't bring it up unless the prosecution does.

Option H: The defendant may not introduce evidence to show honesty unless it is inquired into on cross-examination. I'm not sure if cross-examination is the trigger or if it's about the prosecution attacking the character.

Option I: The defendant may introduce evidence to show dishonesty. That seems contradictory because the defendant would want to show good character, not bad. So this is probably incorrect.

Putting it all together, the correct rule is that the defendant cannot introduce evidence of their good character unless the prosecution has first attacked their character. So the correct statement is Option G: The defendant may not introduce evidence of good character unless the prosecution first attacks his character.
