Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. It's about calculating the force on an alpha particle when it's passing by a gold atomic nucleus at a certain distance. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

First, I remember that when charged particles are close to each other, they exert an electrostatic force on each other. Coulomb's Law comes into play here. Coulomb's Law states that the force between two charges is proportional to the product of their charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. The formula is F = k * |q1 * q2| / r², where k is Coulomb's constant.

So, the alpha particle and the gold nucleus are both charged. I need to figure out their charges. An alpha particle is a helium nucleus, which has a charge of +2e, where e is the elementary charge. Gold's atomic number is 79, so a gold nucleus has a charge of +79e. Wait, no, wait. Oh right, the alpha particle has a charge of +2e because it's two protons, and the gold nucleus has 79 protons, so its charge is +79e.

But wait, in the problem, the alpha particle is passing the gold nucleus. So, are we considering the force between the alpha and the gold nucleus? Yes, that's right. So both are positive charges, so the force will be repulsive. But since the question just asks for the magnitude, the direction doesn't matter here.

Next, I need to plug the numbers into Coulomb's Law. Let me list out the values:

- Charge of alpha particle (q1): +2e
- Charge of gold nucleus (q2): +79e
- Distance (r): 0.00300 Ångströms. Wait, I need to convert that into meters because the standard unit for distance in Coulomb's Law is meters. I remember that 1 Ångström is 1e-10 meters. So 0.00300 Å is 3e-13 meters. Let me double-check that: yeah, 0.003 * 1e-10 m = 3e-13 m.

Coulomb's constant (k) is approximately 8.988e9 N·m²/C².

Now, the charges: e is approximately 1.602e-19 coulombs. So q1 is 2 * 1.602e-19 C, and q2 is 79 * 1.602e-19 C.

Let me calculate that:

q1 = 2 * 1.602e-19 = 3.204e-19 C
q2 = 79 * 1.602e-19 ≈ 126.558e-19 C, which is 1.26558e-17 C.

Wait, no, 79 * 1.602 is let me calculate it accurately. 70 * 1.602 is 112.14, and 9 *1.602 is 14.418, so total 112.14 +14.418= 126.558. So yes, q2 is 126.558e-19 C, which is 1.26558e-17 C.

Wait, wait, no, 79 *1.602e-19 is 79 *1.602 = 126.558, so 126.558e-19 C, which is 1.26558e-17 C. Right.

So now, plugging into F = k * |q1 q2| / r².

Let me compute each part step by step.

First, compute q1 * q2: (3.204e-19 C) * (1.26558e-17 C) 

Wait, 3.204e-19 * 1.26558e-17 is equal to (3.204 * 1.26558) * 1e-36.

Calculating 3.204 * 1.26558:

3 * 1.26558 is about 3.79674, plus 0.204 * 1.26558. Let me compute that:

0.2 *1.26558=0.253116, 0.004*1.26558≈0.00506232. So total 0.253116+0.00506232=0.25817832. So total 3.79674 +0.25817832 ≈4.05491832.

So q1*q2 ≈4.05491832e-36 C².

Now, r is 3e-13 meters, so r² is (3e-13)^2 =9e-26 m².

So the denominator r² is 9e-26.

Now, putting it all together: F = (8.988e9) * (4.05491832e-36) / (9e-26)

First, compute numerator: 8.988e9 *4.05491832e-36.

Let me compute 8.988 *4.05491832. Let's approximate that.

8 *4.0549 is about 32.4392, and 0.988 *4.0549 ≈4.007.

So total approx 32.4392 +4.007=36.446.

But more accurately, 8.988 *4.05491832 = ?

Let me compute 8 *4.05491832=32.43934656.

0.988 *4.05491832= Let's compute 4.05491832 *1 =4.05491832, subtract 0.012 *4.05491832.

0.012 *4.05491832 ≈0.04865901984.

So 4.05491832 - 0.04865901984 ≈3.0062593.

So total 32.43934656 +3.0062593 ≈35.44560586.

So 8.988e9 *4.05491832e-36 =35.44560586e-27, because 1e9 *1e-36=1e-27.

So numerator is approximately 3.544560586e-26 N·m²/C² * C² → N·m².

Wait, no, wait, the units would be (N·m²/C²) * (C²) → N·m², but then we divide by m², so units become N.

Wait, perhaps I should just proceed with the calculation.

So F = (35.44560586e-26) / (9e-26)

Wait, because 35.4456e-26 divided by 9e-26 is (35.4456 /9) * (e-26 /e-26) ) → approximately 3.9384 *1 =3.9384.

Wait, 35.4456 /9 is 3.9384.

So F ≈3.9384 N.

Wait, but that seems way too high because looking at the options, the highest is J: 0.705 N.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me go through the steps again.

Wait, maybe I messed up the exponents. Let me recheck.

Wait, the numerator after multiplying k and q1*q2:

k =8.988e9 N·m²/C².

q1*q2=3.204e-19 C * 1.26558e-17 C =3.204 *1.26558 = let's compute that more accurately.

3.204 *1.26558.

Let me compute 3 *1.26558=3.79674.

0.204 *1.26558: 0.2 *1.26558=0.253116, 0.004 *1.26558=0.00506232. So total 0.253116 +0.00506232=0.25817832.

So total q1*q2 =3.79674 +0.25817832=4.05491832e-36 C².

Then, k*(q1*q2)=8.988e9 *4.05491832e-36 = let's compute 8.988 *4.05491832 first.

8.988 *4.05491832:

Let me compute this using a calculator approach.

4.05491832 * 8 =32.43934656
4.05491832 *0.988 = let's compute 4.05491832 *1 =4.05491832, minus 4.05491832 *0.012.

4.05491832 *0.012 =0.04865901984.

So 4.05491832 -0.04865901984 ≈4.0062593.

So total is 32.43934656 +4.0062593 ≈36.44560586.

So 8.988e9 *4.05491832e-36 =36.44560586e-27.

Wait, because 1e9 *1e-36=1e-27.

So 36.44560586e-27 is 3.644560586e-26.

Now, dividing by r² which is (3e-13)^2=9e-26 m².

So F=3.644560586e-26 /9e-26 = (3.644560586 /9) * (1e-26 /1e-26) = 0.404951176 *1 =0.404951176 N.

Hmm, that's approximately 0.405 N.

Looking at the options, option F is 0.405 N, and option H is 0.509 N, etc.

So the force is about 0.405 N, which is option F.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations because I might have made a mistake in the exponents earlier.

Wait, so k =8.988e9 N·m²/C².

q1=2e=3.204e-19 C.

q2=79e=126.558e-19 C=1.26558e-17 C.

So q1*q2=3.204e-19 *1.26558e-17= (3.204 *1.26558) *1e-36=4.0549e-36 C².

Multiply by k: 8.988e9 *4.0549e-36 = (8.988 *4.0549) *1e-27.

8.988 *4.0549 ≈36.445, so 36.445e-27.

Then divide by r²: (3e-13)^2=9e-26.

So F=36.445e-27 /9e-26 = (36.445 /9) * (e-27 /e-26) )=4.0494 * 0.1 =0.40494 N.

Yes, so approximately 0.405 N, which is option F.

The force on an alpha particle passing by a gold nucleus at a distance of $0.00300 \, \text{Å}$ is calculated using Coulomb's Law:  
\[
F = k \cdot \frac{|q_1 \cdot q_2|}{r^2}
\]  
where:  
- \( q_1 = +2e = 3.204 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C} \) (alpha particle charge)  
- \( q_2 = +79e = 1.26558 \times 10^{-17} \, \text{C} \) (gold nucleus charge)  
- \( r = 0.00300 \, \text{Å} = 3 \times 10^{-13} \, \text{m} \)  
- \( k = 8.988 \times 10^9 \, \text{N·m}^2/\text{C}^2 \)  

First, calculate \( q_1 \cdot q_2 = (3.204 \times 10^{-19}) \cdot (1.26558 \times 10^{-17}) = 4.0549 \times 10^{-36} \, \text{C}^2 \).  
Then, \( k \cdot q_1 \cdot q_2 = (8.988 \times 10^9) \cdot (4.0549 \times 10^{-36}) = 3.64456 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{N·m}^2 \).  
Next, \( r^2 = (3 \times 10^{-13})^2 = 9 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{m}^2 \).  
Finally, \( F = \frac{3.64456 \times 10^{-26}}{9 \times 10^{-26}} \approx 0.405 \, \text{N} \).  

Thus, the force is approximately **0.405 N**, corresponding to option **F**.
