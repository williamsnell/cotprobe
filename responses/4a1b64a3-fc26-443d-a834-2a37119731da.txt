Okay, so I have this question here about cities and their size relative to others in a country. The question is asking what a city is called if it's more than twice as large as the next biggest city. The options are A through J, and I need to pick the right one.

Let me think. I remember that there's a term related to the size hierarchy of cities. I think it's something like a primate city. I'm not entirely sure, but I recall that a primate city is the largest in a country and significantly bigger than the others. For example, in some countries, the capital is the primate city because it's way bigger than any other city. So if a city is more than twice as large as the next, that fits the definition of a primate city.

Wait, let me check the other options to make sure. Option A is global city. I think a global city is more about its influence on a global scale, like New York or London, not necessarily about being the largest in the country. Option B is dominant city, which sounds similar, but I'm not sure if that's the exact term used in geography. Option C is primate city, which I'm more confident about. Option D is metropolitan city, which refers to a large urban area, but not specifically about being the largest in the country. Option E is superior city, which sounds a bit vague. Option F is magnified city, which I don't think is a standard term. Option G is colossal city, which just describes size, not the relative size compared to others. Option H is megalopolis, which I think refers to a large urban complex made up of multiple cities, like the Boston-Washington area. Option I is world leader city, again more about global influence. Option J is giant city, which is just a big city but not necessarily the largest in its country.

So, putting it all together, the term that fits is primate city. The city being more than twice as large as the next largest supports this because primate cities are defined by their dominance in size and often function. So the answer should be C.

The correct answer is C: primate city. This term describes a city that is significantly larger than the next largest city in a country, often dominating its region.

Answer: C
