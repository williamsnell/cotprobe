Okay, so I've got this question about whether a certain set of functions is sequentially compact. The set in question is F(x) = ∫₀ˣ f(t) dt where f is in M, and M is the set of bounded functions on [0,1]. The first part is asking if this set F is sequentially compact, and then I have to choose between options 1 to 4 for the theorem used.

First, I need to recall what sequential compactness means. In the context of function spaces, a set is sequentially compact if every sequence of functions in the set has a convergent subsequence. For spaces like C[0,1], which is the space of continuous functions on [0,1] with the uniform norm, the Arzelà-Ascoli theorem is the usual tool to determine compactness. The theorem states that a subset of C[0,1] is compact if it is closed, bounded, and equicontinuous.

So, let's think about the set F. Each F is defined as the integral of f from 0 to x, where f is bounded. Since f is bounded, the integral F will be absolutely continuous, which implies that F is continuously differentiable with derivative f, which is bounded. So F is uniformly continuous because its derivative is bounded and continuous (since f is in M, which is bounded, but wait, M is just bounded functions, not necessarily continuous. Hmm, that's a point to consider.)

Wait, M is the set of bounded functions in C[0,1]. So f is continuous and bounded on [0,1]. So F(x) is the integral of f, which makes F not only absolutely continuous but also continuously differentiable with F’=f. Since f is bounded, F’ is bounded, so F is Lipschitz continuous, which implies uniform continuity.

Now, to check if F is sequentially compact, I need to see if every sequence in F has a convergent subsequence. Using Arzelà-Ascoli, I can check the conditions: boundedness, equicontinuity, and maybe closedness.

First, are the functions F(x) bounded? Since f is bounded, say |f(t)| ≤ M for all t, then |F(x)| = |∫₀ˣ f(t) dt| ≤ ∫₀ˣ |f(t)| dt ≤ M x ≤ M. So F(x) is bounded by M, which is the bound on f. But M can vary for different f in M, but in this case, M is the set of all such f, so perhaps the bound isn't uniform across all F? Wait, no, because for each f, F is bounded by the integral up to x=1, which would be bounded by the sup norm of f. But since M is the set of all bounded f, their sup norms can be arbitrary. Wait, but F is constructed for each f, so each F is an antiderivative of f, which is bounded because f is bounded.

But wait, the set F is constructed from all f in M. So each F is in C[0,1], and we need to see if the set {F} is bounded in C[0,1]. The sup norm of F is the maximum of |F(x)| on [0,1], which is ≤ M, where M is the bound on f. But M can be any positive number because f is just any bounded function in C[0,1]. So actually, the functions F could have arbitrarily large bounds. Therefore, the set {F} is not uniformly bounded in C[0,1]. That would mean it's not bounded, so by the Arzelà-Ascoli theorem, it's not necessarily compact.

Wait, but wait. Maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again. Each F is constructed from a specific f in M. So for each f, F is the integral of f. The question is whether the set {F | f ∈ M} is sequentially compact. So we're considering all possible F's generated by all f's in M, which are bounded and continuous.

But if f can have an arbitrarily large bound, then F(x) can also have arbitrarily large values. For example, take f_n(t) = n for t in [0,1], but wait, no, because f must be in C[0,1], so f_n(t) = n for all t would not be continuous unless it's constant. Wait, no, a constant function is continuous, but if we take f_n(t) = n for t ∈ [0,1], then F_n(x) = ∫₀ˣ n dt = n x. The sup norm of F_n is n, which goes to infinity as n increases. So the set {F} is not bounded in C[0,1] because the sup norm can be as large as we want. Therefore, the set {F} is not bounded, so it can't be compact because compact sets in C[0,1] are closed, bounded, and equicontinuous.

Wait, but the question is about sequential compactness, which in this case is the same as compactness because of the completeness of C[0,1]. So if the set is not bounded, it's not compact, hence the answer to the first part is no, so 0.

Now, the second part is about which theorem can be used. The options are 1. Arzelà-Ascoli, 2. Riesz, 3. Banach fixed point, 4. None.

I think Arzelà-Ascoli is the relevant theorem here because it's about compactness in C[0,1]. The Riesz representation theorem is about dual spaces, Banach fixed point is about contractions, which doesn't apply here. So the correct theorem would be 1, but wait, earlier I concluded that the set isn't compact because it's not bounded. But the question is, can we use Arzelà-Ascoli to prove it? Well, if the set isn't compact, then using Arzelà-Ascoli would show it's not compact, but the answer is about whether the set is sequentially compact, which it isn't, and the theorem that can be used is Arzelà-Ascoli to show it's not compact.

Wait, but the question says "it can be proved using" one of the theorems. So if the answer is no, and the theorem used is Arzelà-Ascoli, then the second part would be 1. But earlier I thought the set isn't compact, so the first part is 0, and the theorem used is 1. So the answer would be [0,1].

Wait, but the options don't have [0,1]. Let me check the options again. The options are A to J, each a list of two numbers. So for example, option H is [0,4], which would mean the set is not compact (0) and the theorem used is none of the above (4).

Wait, but I thought the set isn't compact because it's not bounded, so the first part is 0. For the theorem, I thought Arzelà-Ascoli (1) would be used to show it's not compact. So the answer would be [0,1], but looking at the options, option F is [1,0], which is the opposite. Option H is [0,4], which would mean the theorem is none of the above. But I thought Arzelà-Ascoli can be used to show it's not compact because it's not equicontinuous or not bounded.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me reevaluate. The set F is {∫₀ˣ f(t)dt | f ∈ M}. Each F is absolutely continuous, with derivative f, which is bounded. So F is Lipschitz, hence uniformly continuous. Now, for equicontinuity, since all F have derivatives bounded by the same bound as f. But wait, f can have different bounds. For example, f_n could have bound n, leading F_n to have derivative n, so F_n is n-Lipschitz. So the set {F} is not equicontinuous because the Lipschitz constants can be arbitrarily large. Therefore, by Arzelà-Ascoli, the set is not compact because it's not equicontinuous.

So, using Arzelà-Ascoli, we can show it's not compact, so the answer to the first part is 0, and the theorem used is 1. So the answer is [0,1], but looking at the options, option F is [1,0], which doesn't fit. Wait, no, option E is [1,1], which would mean yes and Arzelà-Ascoli, but that's not correct because the set isn't compact.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the first part. Maybe the set is compact. Let me think again. If f is in M, which is bounded, then F(x) = ∫₀ˣ f(t)dt. The set F is then the set of all such integrals. Now, if f is bounded, say |f(t)| ≤ K for all t, then |F(x)| ≤ K x ≤ K. So F is bounded by K. Also, F is Lipschitz with constant K, so equicontinuous. So if we consider all F's with the same bound K, then they form a compact set by Arzelà-Ascoli. But M is the set of all bounded f's, so K can vary. So the set F is the union over all K of these compact sets. But the union of infinitely many compact sets isn't necessarily compact.

Wait, but the question is whether the set F is sequentially compact. If the set isn't bounded, then it's not compact. But earlier I thought that for each f, F is bounded, but the set of all F's isn't bounded because K can be any positive number. So the set {F} isn't bounded in C[0,1], hence not compact.

Therefore, the first answer is 0 (no, it's not compact), and the theorem used is Arzelà-Ascoli (1). So the answer would be [0,1], but looking at the options, I don't see that. Wait, option E is [1,1], which is yes and Arzelà-Ascoli, which is incorrect. Option H is [0,4], meaning no and none of the above. But I thought Arzelà-Ascoli can be used to show it's not compact. So perhaps the correct answer is [0,1], but that's not among the options. Wait, let me check the options again.

Options:
A: [0,2]
B: [0,3]
C: [1,3]
D: [0,1]
E: [1,1]
F: [1,0]
G: [1,2]
H: [0,4]
I: [1,4]
J: [0,0]

Wait, option D is [0,1], which is the answer I thought. So the correct answer would be D: [0,1]. But earlier I thought that the set isn't compact because it's not bounded, so first part 0, and the theorem used is Arzelà-Ascoli, so second part 1. So the answer is [0,1], which is option D.
</think>

The set F is not sequentially compact because it's not bounded in C[0,1]. The Arzelà-Ascoli theorem shows this by demonstrating the lack of equicontinuity due to unbounded derivatives. 

Answer: [0,1]

The correct option is D: [0,1].
