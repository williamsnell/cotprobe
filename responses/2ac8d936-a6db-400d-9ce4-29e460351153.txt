Okay, so I have this question about total utility and when it's maximized regarding sardines. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on microeconomics, but let me think.

The question is asking about the point where total utility is maximized when purchasing sardines. The options are A through J. I remember that utility maximization is a key concept in consumer theory. So, the idea is that consumers make choices to maximize their own satisfaction, which is their utility.

Wait, I think it has something to do with marginal utility and marginal cost. Oh right, the marginal utility per dollar. But wait, in this question, I don't see any mention of dollars, so maybe it's a simpler case where cost is just the quantity purchased.

So, the basic rule is that a consumer should buy more of a good until the marginal utility of the next unit equals the marginal cost (or price) of that unit. Because if the marginal utility (the additional satisfaction from one more unit) is higher than the marginal cost (the additional expense), it's worth buying more. But once they're equal, that's the point of maximum utility.

Looking at the options, option E says marginal utility is zero. That doesn't sound right because if marginal utility is zero, you wouldn't gain any satisfaction from another unit, so you'd stop. But usually, when marginal utility equals marginal cost, that's when you stop. So that would be when the additional satisfaction equals the additional cost.

Wait, looking back, option I says marginal utility equals marginal cost. Oh, that's probably the right one. Because when the extra benefit (marginal utility) equals the extra cost (marginal cost), that's the point where total utility is maximized. Any more than that, and the cost outweighs the benefit, so you stop.

Other options: Option A is total cost equals total benefit. That's more like break-even, but not necessarily where utility is maximized. Option B is marginal benefit equals marginal cost, but in economics, marginal benefit is the same as marginal utility. So B and I are similar, but I think B is phrased differently. Wait, marginal benefit is the same as marginal utility, but the question is about when total utility is maximized. So I think it's when marginal utility equals marginal cost, which is option I.

Option C is consumer surplus zero. Consumer surplus is the difference between what you're willing to pay and what you actually pay. If it's zero, you're paying exactly what you're willing, but that doesn't directly relate to utility maximization. Option D is distributive efficiency, which is about fairness in distribution, not utility maximization. Option F is consumer demand at its highest, but demand is a curve, not a point. G is price at lowest point, which might affect purchasing but not directly utility. H is production cost at minimum, which is a producer's concern, not the consumer's. J is marginal cost zero, which would mean the item is free, but that's not realistic here.

So, putting it together, the correct answer should be option I: marginal utility equals marginal cost.

The total utility from sardines is maximized when the additional satisfaction (marginal utility) from consuming one more unit equals the additional cost (marginal cost) of that unit. This ensures that the consumer is optimizing their purchase decision by balancing the benefits and costs of each additional unit.
