Question:

Explain why the average fixed cost curve (AFC) slopes down-ward throughout, while the average variable cost curve (AVC) slopes down at first, but then turns upward.

Options:

A: The AFC slopes downward due to a decrease in demand for the product, while the AVC slopes upward from the start due to increasing variable costs.
B: The AFC slopes upward as quantity increases
C: The AFC slopes downward because it represents the spread of fixed costs over an increasing number of units, while the AVC initially decreases due to a fixed proportion of inputs and then increases as variable input prices rise.
D: The AVC turns upward due to an increase in fixed inputs
E: The AFC slopes downward as quantity increases because of increased efficiency in production, while the AVC initially decreases due to underutilization of variable inputs and then increases because of market forces.
F: The AFC slopes downward because as quantity increases, the average fixed cost per unit decreases. The AVC slopes down at first due to fuller utilization of the fixed inputs and the extension of specialization but then turns upward due to the law of diminishing returns.
G: The AFC remains constant throughout because it is independent of output, and the AVC slopes downward indefinitely as economies of scale are realized.
H: The AFC slopes downward because as quantity increases, the total fixed cost is spread over more units. The AVC initially falls due to technological advances, but then rises because of increased labor costs.
I: The AVC always slopes downwards
J: Both the AFC and AVC slope downward as quantity increases due to continuous improvements in production technology and efficiency.

Okay, so I have this economics question about average fixed cost (AFC) and average variable cost (AVC) curves. Hmm, I remember from my studies that these curves have specific shapes, but I need to think through why.

First, the question is asking why the AFC curve slopes downward throughout, while the AVC curve slopes downward at first and then turns upward. Let me break this down.

I think about what AFC and AVC represent. AFC is fixed costs divided by the quantity produced. Fixed costs are things like rent, salaries, or machinery that don't change with the level of production. So as you produce more units, the same fixed cost is spread over more units, which means the average fixed cost per unit decreases. That makes the AFC curve slope downward because as quantity increases, AFC decreases. So that explains why AFC slopes downward.

Now, for AVC. AVC is variable costs divided by quantity. Variable costs change with production levels. At first, as production increases, variable costs per unit might decrease because of factors like increased efficiency, better division of labor, or perhaps because fixed inputs are being used more effectively. This would cause AVC to slope downward initially. But then, at some point, the law of diminishing returns kicks in. Diminishing returns happen when adding more variable inputs (like labor or materials) results in smaller increases in output. So, beyond a certain point, each additional unit of production costs more because the marginal product of the variable inputs starts to decrease. This causes AVC to start increasing after a certain quantity. Therefore, the AVC curve slopes downward at first and then turns upward.

Looking at the options, I need to find the one that matches this reasoning.

Option C says: AFC slopes downward because fixed costs are spread over more units. AVC initially decreases due to fixed input proportions and then increases as variable costs rise. That sounds right because it's talking about spreading fixed costs and then variable costs increasing due to diminishing returns.

Option F: AFC slopes down because total fixed cost is spread over more units. AVC slopes down due to specialization and then up due to diminishing returns. That also makes sense, but I think the reason AVC initially decreases is more about spreading variable costs and perhaps increasing marginal product before diminishing returns set in.

Wait, let me think again. AVC initially slopes down because of increasing returns to scale or perhaps because of more efficient use of fixed factors. But as production increases beyond a certain point, the marginal cost starts to increase because each additional unit becomes more expensive due to the law of diminishing marginal returns. So, AVC first decreases and then increases.

Option C says AVC initially decreases due to a fixed proportion of inputs and then increases as variable input prices rise. Hmm, that might not be the exact reason. It's more about the marginal cost increasing, not necessarily variable input prices rising.

Option F says AVC slopes down due to fuller utilization of fixed inputs and specialization, then up due to diminishing returns. That seems better because it's about utilizing fixed inputs and then the law of diminishing returns.

Wait, the question says why does AVC slope down first and then up. So, the correct reasoning is that at low levels of production, as you increase output, AVC decreases because you're using your fixed factors more efficiently, and perhaps because of increasing specialization. But after a point, adding more variable inputs leads to diminishing marginal returns, so AVC starts to increase.

So, looking at the options again.

Option C: AFC slopes down because fixed costs spread over more units. AVC initially decreases due to fixed proportion of inputs and then increases as variable input prices rise. Hmm, the variable input prices may not necessarily rise; it's more about the marginal cost increasing due to diminishing returns.

Option F: AFC slopes down because total fixed cost is spread over more units. AVC slopes down due to specialization and extension, then up due to diminishing returns. That seems correct.

Wait, but in my notes, I remember that AVC initially decreases because of the spreading of fixed costs and then increases because of diminishing marginal returns. Or is it that AVC is only about variable costs, so the initial decrease is due to more efficient use of variable inputs and then the increase is due to diminishing returns.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up things. Let's clarify:

AFC = Total Fixed Cost / Quantity. As Q increases, AFC decreases because TFC is fixed.

AVC = Total Variable Cost / Quantity. TVC increases with Q, but the rate at which it increases (marginal cost) initially might be decreasing, then increasing.

So, the shape of AVC is due to the change in marginal cost. Initially, as production increases, each additional unit might require less variable cost per unit because of more efficient use of fixed factors (like setting up a production line more efficiently as you make more units). This would cause AVC to slope downward. Then, as production keeps increasing, the marginal cost starts to increase due to diminishing returns, causing AVC to slope upward.

So, the initial decrease in AVC is because of more efficient use of fixed factors, perhaps leading to lower average variable costs per unit. Then, as you hit the point where adding more variable inputs (like labor) leads to diminishing marginal product, the AVC starts to increase.

Looking back at the options, which one matches this?

Option F: AFC slopes down because of spreading fixed costs. AVC slopes down due to specialization and extension, then up due to diminishing returns. That seems correct.

Option C: AVC slopes down because of fixed proportion of inputs, then up due to rising variable input prices. That might not be as accurate because variable input prices don't necessarily rise; it's more about the marginal cost increasing.

Therefore, the correct answer is F.
</think>

The average fixed cost (AFC) curve slopes downward because fixed costs are spread over an increasing number of units as production increases, leading to a decrease in the average fixed cost per unit. On the other hand, the average variable cost (AVC) curve initially slopes downward due to factors like increased specialization and more efficient use of fixed inputs, which reduce the average variable cost per unit. However, as production continues to increase, the law of diminishing returns comes into play, causing marginal costs to rise and the AVC curve to slope upward.

F: The AFC slopes downward because as quantity increases, the average fixed cost per unit decreases. The AVC slopes down at first due to fuller utilization of the fixed inputs and the extension of specialization but then turns upward due to the law of diminishing returns.
