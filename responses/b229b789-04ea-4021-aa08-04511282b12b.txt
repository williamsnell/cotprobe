Okay, so I have this economics question here about productivity and wage guidelines. Let me try to break it down. The question says that productivity is increasing by a uniform 2 percent in all industries. I need to figure out what the wage guideline should be to hold inflation at 6 percent. The options are from A to J, and I'm supposed to pick one.

Hmm, I remember that productivity increases usually affect the economy in terms of costs and prices. If productivity goes up, that means each worker is producing more. So, if wages increase, but productivity is also increasing, the cost per unit might not go up as much because each worker is more efficient.

Wait, inflation is about the general increase in prices. So if the inflation target is 6%, that probably relates to the price level. Now, the wage guideline is about how much wages should increase. If wages go up too much, that could lead to higher prices because businesses might pass on the costs to consumers. But productivity increases can offset some of that because each worker is more productive, so maybe the wage increase doesn't have to be as high.

I think there's a formula or a concept here. Let me recall. There's something about the relationship between productivity growth, wage increases, and price increases. I think it's related to the idea that if productivity increases by a certain percentage, and you want to keep inflation at a target level, the wage increase should be adjusted accordingly.

So, if productivity increases by 2%, that could allow for a wage increase without causing too much inflation. Because the same amount of goods can be produced with more efficiency, so the cost per unit goes down. So, if wages go up by 2%, but productivity also goes up by 2%, the real wage increase is zero because the same wage buys the same amount of goods. But wait, the question is about holding inflation at 6%.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the overall price level. If the wage increases by a certain percentage, and productivity increases by another, the net effect on prices would be the difference. Because higher wages would tend to increase costs, but higher productivity would lower them.

So, if inflation is to be 6%, that's the price level increase. The wage increase plus the productivity increase should equal the inflation target. Or wait, maybe it's the other way around. Let me think.

Suppose productivity increases by 2%. That means that each worker's output is 2% higher. If wages increase by x%, then the cost per unit of output would increase by (x% - 2%). Because the same wage divided by a higher productivity would mean lower cost per unit. So, for the price to increase by 6%, the cost per unit needs to increase by 6%.

Wait, no, that might not be right. Let me clarify. The price level is influenced by the cost of production. If wages go up, that's a cost, which would tend to increase prices. But if productivity goes up, each worker is producing more, so the cost per unit goes down. So, the net effect on prices would be the increase in wages minus the increase in productivity.

So, if we want the price level to increase by 6%, then the wage increase minus productivity increase should equal 6%.

Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Because higher productivity lowers the cost per unit, so if wages increase by x%, and productivity by 2%, the cost per unit increases by (x% - 2%). We want this to cause the price to increase by 6%, so x% - 2% = 6%? That would mean x = 8%.

Wait, that can't be right because if productivity is increasing by 2%, and wages by 8%, then the cost per unit would go up by 6%, leading to a 6% price increase. That seems to fit.

Alternatively, maybe it's the other way around. Let me think again. Productivity increase means each worker is more efficient. So, if productivity increases by 2%, the same amount of goods can be produced with 2% less labor cost. So, if wages go up by x%, but productivity by 2%, then the overall cost increase would be x% - 2%.

If we set x% - 2% = 6%, then x is 8%. So, the wage guideline should be an 8% increase. Looking at the options, F is 8%.

Wait, but let me double-check. Suppose without any productivity increase, if wages go up by 8%, that would directly cause prices to go up by 8%, assuming all costs are labor. But since productivity is increasing by 2%, the cost per unit only goes up by 6% (8% - 2%). Therefore, prices increase by 6%, which is the target. So yes, the wage guideline should be 8%.

The correct answer is **F: 8%**. 

To hold inflation at 6%, the wage increase should account for the productivity gain. If productivity increases by 2%, and wages increase by 8%, the cost per unit rises by 6% (8% - 2%), matching the inflation target.
