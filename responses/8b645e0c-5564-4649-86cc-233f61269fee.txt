Okay, so I have this problem about an astronomical telescope. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my optics, but let me try to work through it step by step.

The question says the objective lens has a focal length of 40 cm. Oh right, the objective is the big lens at the front that gathers light. Then it mentions an f-number of f/5. Wait, f-number is usually f/(2L), where L is the diameter, right? So for a telescope, the f-number is the focal length divided by the diameter of the objective. So f-number here is f/5, which means f/(5) = focal length divided by diameter.

Let me write that down: f-number = F/D = f/5. So F is 40 cm, so 40/D = 40/5? Wait, no, that would mean D=5 cm? Because 40 divided by D equals 40/5, which is 8. Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing up. Let me think again.

Wait, the f-number is F/D. So F is given as 40 cm, and the f-number is (f/5), which probably means the f-number is 5, because f-number is F/D. Wait no, wait. The f-number is given as f/5, which probably means F/D = f/5. Wait, that's confusing. Let me clarify.

Wait, the f-number is calculated as F/D, where F is the focal length and D is the diameter. So if the f-number is (f/5), does that mean F/D = (f/5)? Or maybe it's given as an f-number of 5, because f-number is typically denoted as f/N where N is the number, like f/8, f/4, etc. So in this case, the f-number is 5. So F/D = 5. So F is 40 cm, so 40/D =5 → D=40/5=8 cm. So the diameter D of the objective is 8 cm.

Wait, but then the problem says for parallel rays, the exit pupil has a diameter of 2 cm. Hmm, the exit pupil diameter. I remember that for a telescope, the exit pupil is given by D/E, where E is the eyepiece's diameter. Wait, no, wait. The exit pupil is the diameter of the beam exiting the eyepiece, which is given by the formula exit pupil diameter = (D * f_e) / F, where f_e is the focal length of the eyepiece. Or perhaps another approach.

Wait, the exit pupil diameter is the diameter of the light beam leaving the eyepiece, and for a telescope, it's given by D * (f_e)/(F), where F is the objective focal length, and f_e is the eyepiece focal length. So exit pupil diameter = (D * f_e) / F.

But wait, I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, the exit pupil diameter is calculated as D / (M), where M is the angular magnification. Because the angular magnification M is given by M = F/f_e, so the exit pupil would be D / (F/f_e) ) = D * f_e / F. So that matches the earlier formula.

So given that the exit pupil diameter is 2 cm, and D (objective diameter) is 8 cm, we can set up the equation:

Exit pupil diameter = (D * f_e) / F → 2 = (8 * f_e) / 40.

Let me solve for f_e:

2 = (8 * f_e) /40 → 2 *40 =8 * f_e → 80=8 f_e → f_e=10 cm. So the eyepiece focal length is 10 cm.

Wait, but let me check again. Alternatively, maybe the exit pupil diameter is given by the formula D / (M), where M is the magnification. Because M is F/f_e, so D/(M) would be D * f_e / F, which is the same as before.

So exit pupil is 2 cm, which equals (8 * f_e) /40 → 8 f_e =80 → f_e=10 cm. So the eyepiece focal length is 10 cm.

Now, the angular magnification M is given by M = F/f_e. F is 40 cm, f_e is 10 cm → M=40/10=4x. Wait, but wait, no, that can't be right. Because in a telescope, the angular magnification is given by M = F/f_e, but when used with the exit pupil, sometimes the magnification is considered with the eye's near point, but perhaps in this problem, we're just considering the basic magnification without considering the eye's correction.

Wait, no, the angular magnification formula for a telescope is M = F/f_e, where F is the objective's focal length, and f_e is the eyepiece's focal length. So with F=40 cm and f_e=10 cm, M=40/10=4x. So the magnification is 4x.

Wait, but looking at the options, none of them have 4x and 10 cm except option D: 4x, 10 cm. But wait, let me check my calculations again.

Wait, the f-number is F/D = 5. So F=40, so D=8 cm. Exit pupil diameter is 2 cm. So 2 = (8 * f_e) /40 → f_e= (2 *40)/8 = 10 cm. So eyepiece focal length is 10 cm.

So M = 40/10 =4x. So the magnification is 4x and eyepiece focal length 10 cm. So that's option D.

But wait, looking at the options, option D is 4x, 10 cm. But wait, let me check again because I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula for the exit pupil.

Wait another approach: the exit pupil is the image of the objective's aperture as seen by the eyepiece. So the exit pupil diameter is equal to the objective diameter multiplied by the eyepiece's magnification (but inverse?), wait no. Maybe another way: The exit pupil diameter is D * (f_e) / F.

Wait, let me think again. The exit pupil is the diameter of the beam after the eyepiece. So when you look through the eyepiece, the beam's diameter is determined by the objective's diameter and the eyepiece's focal length.

The formula is indeed exit pupil diameter = (D * f_e) / F. So 2 cm = (8 cm * f_e) /40 cm → 2 = (8 f_e)/40 → 8 f_e =80 → f_e=10 cm. So that's correct.

So the eyepiece focal length is 10 cm, and the magnification is 40/10 =4x. So the answer would be 4x, 10 cm, which is option D.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D is 4x, 10 cm. But let me check the options again.

Wait, options:

A:5x,8cm

B:7x,8cm

C:10x,4cm

D:4x,10cm

E:2x,20cm

F:6x,12cm

G:8x,5cm

H:3x,15cm

I:5x,20cm

J:6x,10cm

So option D is 4x and 10 cm, which matches our calculation.

Wait, but wait a second. I'm a bit confused because I remember that the angular magnification is also sometimes given by M = (F)/(f_e) * (1 + f_e/D). No, wait, that's for a different consideration, perhaps when the exit pupil isn't at infinity. But in this problem, we're probably assuming that the exit pupil is at the near point, but I think the basic formula M = F/f_e is sufficient here.

So I think the correct answer is option D: 4x, 10 cm.

The objective lens has a focal length \( F = 40 \, \text{cm} \) and an \( f \)-number of \( f/5 \). The \( f \)-number is given by \( F/D \), where \( D \) is the diameter of the objective. Setting \( F/D = 5 \), we find \( D = 40/5 = 8 \, \text{cm} \).

The exit pupil diameter is given as \( 2 \, \text{cm} \). The exit pupil diameter is related to the objective diameter \( D \), the objective focal length \( F \), and the eyepiece focal length \( f_e \) by the formula:

\[
\text{Exit pupil diameter} = \frac{D \cdot f_e}{F}.
\]

Substituting the known values:

\[
2 = \frac{8 \cdot f_e}{40}.
\]

Solving for \( f_e \):

\[
2 \cdot 40 = 8 \cdot f_e \implies 80 = 8 \cdot f_e \implies f_e = 10 \, \text{cm}.
\]

The angular magnification \( M \) of the telescope is given by:

\[
M = \frac{F}{f_e}.
\]

Substituting \( F = 40 \, \text{cm} \) and \( f_e = 10 \, \text{cm} \):

\[
M = \frac{40}{10} = 4x.
\]

Thus, the angular magnification is \( 4x \), and the eyepiece focal length is \( 10 \, \text{cm} \), corresponding to option **D**.

D: 4x, 10 cm
