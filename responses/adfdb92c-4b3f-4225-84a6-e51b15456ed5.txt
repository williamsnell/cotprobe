Okay, so I've got this problem: In how many ways can 7 people be seated at 5 identical round tables, each with at least 1 person. Hmm, alright, let's break this down. I'm a bit rusty on combinatorics, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

First, I remember that when arranging people around round tables, the number of ways is related to circular permutations. For a single table with n people, the number of ways is (n-1)! because rotations are considered the same. But here, we have multiple tables, and they're identical. So, I think I need to consider both the distribution of people into the tables and the arrangements around each table.

The problem says there are 5 identical tables. Since each table must have at least one person, we're looking to partition 7 people into 5 groups, each with at least 1 person. That sounds like a partition problem. But since the tables are identical, the order of the groups doesn't matter. So, I think this is similar to finding the number of ways to partition 7 distinguishable objects into 5 indistinct, non-empty subsets. Wait, no, actually, the tables are identical, so the order doesn't matter, but each group is a size that can vary.

So, the first step is probably to find the number of ways to split 7 people into 5 groups where each group has at least 1 person. That's the same as finding the number of integer solutions to the equation x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 + x5 = 7, where each xi ≥ 1. But since the tables are identical, the order of the groups doesn't matter, so we need to count the number of partitions of 7 into exactly 5 parts, each at least 1.

Wait, but in combinatorics, the number of partitions of n into k parts is given by the Stirling numbers of the second kind, S(n, k). So, S(7,5) would give the number of ways to partition 7 distinguishable objects into 5 non-empty indistinct subsets.

Right, so that's the first part. Once we have the partitions, for each partition, we need to calculate the number of ways to arrange the people around the tables. Since each table is round, each group of size m_i contributes (m_i - 1)! ways.

So, the total number of arrangements would be S(7,5) multiplied by the product of (m_i -1)! for each group, but wait, no, because the tables are identical, the order of the groups doesn't matter, so we just need to sum over all possible partitions, compute the product for each, and then sum them up.

Wait, but actually, the formula I'm thinking of is that the number of ways to seat n distinguishable people around k indistinguishable circular tables is equal to the sum over all partitions of n into k parts of [ (m1-1)! * (m2-1)! * ... * (mk-1)! ] multiplied by the multinomial coefficient for that partition.

Wait, no, perhaps a better approach is to use the formula for the number of ways to seat n people around k identical tables: it's the sum of (n! / (m1! m2! ... mk! )) * product of (mi -1)! ) for each partition into parts m1, m2, ..., mk. But since the tables are identical, each distinct partition is counted once.

Alternatively, I think the formula is n! multiplied by the sum over all partitions into k parts of [ product of (mi -1)! ] divided by (m1! m2! ... mk! ). Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, let me think again. The number of ways to split n people into k groups of sizes m1, m2, ..., mk (where the order of the groups matters) is given by n! / (m1! m2! ... mk! ). But since the tables are identical, the order doesn't matter, so we have to divide by the number of permutations of the groups, which is k! if all group sizes are distinct. But in our case, group sizes might not be distinct, so we have to account for that.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to use the formula for the number of ways to seat n distinguishable people around k identical circular tables, each with at least one person: it's equal to S(n,k) multiplied by the product of (mi -1)! for each group in the partition, but since the tables are identical, each partition is counted once, so it's the sum over all partitions of n into k parts of [ (m1-1)! (m2-1)! ... (mk-1)! ) ].

Wait, no, perhaps the formula is the sum of [ (n! / (m1! m2! ... mk! )) * (m1-1)! (m2-1)! ... (mk-1)! ) ] for each partition into k parts. Simplifying that, it's n! multiplied by the sum over all partitions into k parts of [ product of (mi -1)! / mi! ].

But that seems complicated. Alternatively, I think the formula is the sum over all partitions into k parts of [ (n! / (m1! m2! ... mk! )) * product of (mi -1)! ) ].

Wait, let's take an example. Suppose n=3, k=2. The partitions are (2,1). The number of ways should be S(3,2)=3. For each partition, the number of arrangements is (2-1)! * (1-1)! = 1 * 1 = 1. So total is 3 * 1 =3. Let me check: the possible ways are seating two people at one table and one at another. Since tables are identical, the number is indeed 3.

But wait, let me compute it using the formula: For each partition (2,1), the number is (3! / (2!1! )) * (1! * 0! ) = (6 / 2) * (1*1) = 3 *1=3. Yes, that works.

So the general formula is sum over all partitions into k parts of [ n! / (m1! m2! ... mk! ) * (m1-1)! (m2-1)! ... (mk-1)! ) ].

Which simplifies to sum over all partitions into k parts of [ n! * product of ( (mi -1)! / mi! ) ) ].

But (mi -1)! / mi! = 1/mi. So the formula becomes sum over all partitions into k parts of [ n! * product of (1/mi) ) ].

Wait, that can't be right because for n=3, k=2, it gives 6 * (1/2 * 1/1) )= 6*(1/2)=3, which is correct. So yes, the formula would be n! multiplied by the sum over all partitions into k parts of [ product of 1/mi ].

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think of it as:

The number of ways is equal to the sum of (n! / (m1! m2! ... mk! )) * (m1-1)! (m2-1)! ... (mk-1)! ) for each partition into k parts.

Which simplifies to sum [ n! * product ( (mi -1)! ) / product (mi! ) ) ] = sum [ n! * product (1/mi) ) ]

So, for each partition into k parts, compute n! multiplied by the product of 1/mi for each part, then sum all these.

So, in our problem, n=7, k=5. So we need to find all partitions of 7 into exactly 5 parts, each at least 1, and for each, compute 7! * (1/m1 * 1/m2 * ... * 1/m5 ), then sum all these.

Wait, but that seems a bit tedious, but manageable.

First, let's list all partitions of 7 into exactly 5 parts, each at least 1. Since 5 parts, each at least 1, the minimum sum is 5, so 7-5=2 to distribute as additional 2 across 5 parts, each can get 0 or more. So the partitions would be the integer solutions where m1 ≥ m2 ≥ ... ≥ m5 ≥1 and sum to 7.

Let me list them:

The possible partitions are:

1. 3,1,1,1,1: sum is 3+1+1+1+1=7.

2. 2,2,1,1,1: sum is 2+2+1+1+1=7.

Are there any others? Let's see: 4,1,1,1,0 is invalid since each must be at least 1. 2,2,2,1,0 is also invalid. Wait, no, since we have exactly 5 parts, each ≥1, so the maximum any part can be is 3, because 3+1+1+1+1=7.

Wait, another possible partition: 3,2,1,1,0 is invalid. So, the only possible partitions into 5 parts are:

- 3,1,1,1,1

- 2,2,1,1,1

Are there any others? Let's see: 2,1,1,1,2 is same as 2,2,1,1,1. So no, only those two.

Wait, but wait, 3,1,1,1,1 and 2,2,1,1,1 are the only possible partitions into 5 parts.

So, now for each partition, compute 7! * (1/m1 * 1/m2 * ... * 1/m5 ).

First, for partition (3,1,1,1,1):

m1=3, m2=1, m3=1, m4=1, m5=1.

So product is (1/3) * (1/1)^4 = 1/3.

So term is 7! * (1/3) = 5040 * (1/3) = 1680.

Second partition (2,2,1,1,1):

m1=2, m2=2, m3=1, m4=1, m5=1.

Product is (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/1)^3 = (1/2)^2 *1 = 1/4.

Term is 7! * (1/4) = 5040 * 1/4 = 1260.

So total number of ways is 1680 + 1260 = 2940.

Wait, but that can't be right because the options given are up to 300, so 2940 is way higher than any option. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, where did I go wrong? Let me check.

Wait, perhaps I misunderstood the problem. The tables are identical, so we might need to consider that when the group sizes are the same, the number of distinct arrangements is less. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the formula I used is incorrect. Let me think again.

Another approach: The number of ways to seat n distinguishable people around k identical circular tables, each with at least one person, is given by the sum over all partitions of n into k parts of [ (n! / (m1! m2! ... mk! )) * product of (mi -1)! ) ].

So, for each partition, the number of ways is (n! / (m1! m2! ... mk! )) * (m1-1)! (m2-1)! ... (mk-1)! ).

Simplify this:

(n! / (m1! m2! ... mk! )) * (m1-1)! (m2-1)! ... (mk-1)! ) = n! * product [ (mi -1)! / mi! ) ] for each i.

Which is n! * product [ 1/mi ] for each i.

So, for each partition, it's 7! multiplied by the product of 1/mi for each part.

Now, for the two partitions:

1. Partition (3,1,1,1,1):

product = 1/3 * 1/1 * 1/1 * 1/1 * 1/1 = 1/3.

Term = 5040 * (1/3) = 1680.

2. Partition (2,2,1,1,1):

product = (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/1)^3 = 1/(2*2) = 1/4.

Term = 5040 * 1/4 = 1260.

So total ways = 1680 + 1260 = 2940.

But the options given are much lower, up to 300. So I must have made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcounting because the tables are identical, so when group sizes are the same, the arrangements are considered the same. But in my calculation, I'm treating each partition as distinct, but maybe I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is different. Let me think: The number of ways to seat n people around k identical tables is equal to the Stirling numbers of the second kind, S(n,k), multiplied by (n-1)! / (n - k)! ), but I'm not sure.

Wait, no, I think I'm mixing up concepts. Let's try another approach.

The problem is similar to counting the number of ways to partition 7 people into 5 circularly arranged groups, where the order of the groups doesn't matter.

The formula for the number of ways to partition n distinguishable objects into k indistinct circularly arranged subsets is given by:

1/k! * sum over all partitions into k parts of [ (n! / (m1! m2! ... mk! )) * product of (mi -1)! ) ]

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is S(n,k) * (n-1)!.

Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think differently.

Each circular arrangement around a table can be considered as a cyclic permutation. For a group of size m, there are (m-1)! ways to arrange them.

So, the total number of ways to arrange n people into k circular tables, where the tables are distinguishable, is equal to the sum over all partitions into k parts of [ (n! / (m1! m2! ... mk! )) * product of (mi -1)! ) ].

But since the tables are identical, we need to divide by k! if all group sizes are distinct. But in our case, group sizes may not be distinct, so it's more complicated.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

The number of ways is equal to the sum over all partitions into k parts of [ (n! / (m1! m2! ... mk! )) * product of (mi -1)! ) ] divided by the number of symmetries, which depends on the number of groups of the same size.

Wait, this is getting too complicated. Maybe I should look for another way.

Wait, let me think of it as first assigning people to the tables, then arranging them around the tables.

Since the tables are identical, the order of the tables doesn't matter. So, the number of ways is equal to the number of ways to partition the people into groups, multiplied by the number of arrangements around each table.

But since the tables are identical, we have to consider the partitions where the order of the groups doesn't matter.

So, the number of ways is the sum over all partitions of 7 into 5 parts of [ (number of ways to assign people to that partition) * (number of circular arrangements for each group) ].

The number of ways to assign people to a specific partition (m1, m2, ..., m5) is 7! / (m1! m2! ... m5! ), and the number of circular arrangements per group is (m1-1)! (m2-1)! ... (m5-1)!.

So, for each partition, the term is [7! / (m1! m2! ... m5! )] * [ (m1-1)! (m2-1)! ... (m5-1)! ) ].

Which simplifies to 7! * product [ (mi -1)! / mi! ) ] = 7! * product [1/mi].

So, for each partition, compute 7! * (1/m1 * 1/m2 * ... * 1/m5).

Now, let's compute this for each partition:

Partition 1: (3,1,1,1,1)

Product: 1/3 * 1/1 * 1/1 * 1/1 * 1/1 = 1/3.

Term: 5040 * (1/3) = 1680.

Partition 2: (2,2,1,1,1)

Product: (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/1) * (1/1) * (1/1) = 1/4.

Term: 5040 * 1/4 = 1260.

Total ways: 1680 + 1260 = 2940.

But the options are up to 300, so I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcounting because the tables are identical. So, when the group sizes are the same, the groups are indistinct, so I need to adjust for that.

In the case where group sizes are the same, the number of distinct partitions is less because swapping groups of the same size doesn't create a new arrangement.

So, for example, in the partition (2,2,1,1,1), there are two groups of size 2 and three groups of size 1. The number of ways to assign people to this partition is 7! / (2! 2! 1! 1! 1! ) * (1/2! ) because the two groups of size 2 are indistinct, and the three groups of size 1 are indistinct.

Wait, no, perhaps the formula should account for the number of ways to partition into groups where some groups are the same size. So, the number of distinct partitions is given by the multinomial coefficient divided by the product of the factorials of the counts of each group size.

So, for the partition (2,2,1,1,1), the number of distinct ways is [7! / (2! 2! 1! 1! 1! ) ] / [ (2! ) (3! ) ] where 2! accounts for the two groups of size 2 and 3! accounts for the three groups of size 1.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me try to recall the formula for the number of distinct partitions into groups when there are groups of the same size.

The number of ways to partition a set of n elements into groups of sizes m1, m2, ..., mk, where there are duplicates in the group sizes, is given by:

n! / ( (m1! m2! ... mk! ) * (c1! c2! ... cr! ) )

where ci is the number of groups of each size. For example, if group sizes are [2,2,1,1,1], then c1=3 (three groups of size 1), c2=2 (two groups of size 2). So the number of distinct partitions would be 7! / ( (2!^2 * 1!^3 ) * (2! * 3! ) ).

Wait, maybe that's the correct approach. So, for each partition, the number of ways is [n! / (m1! m2! ... mk! ) ] divided by the product of the factorials of the counts of each group size.

So, for the partition (3,1,1,1,1):

Group sizes: one group of size 3, four groups of size 1.

Number of distinct partitions: 7! / (3! 1!^4 ) / (1! * 4! ), because there's 1 group of size 3 and 4 groups of size 1.

Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Let me think again.

The number of ways to partition into groups where there are c1 groups of size m1, c2 groups of size m2, etc., is given by:

n! / ( (m1!^c1 c1! ) (m2!^c2 c2! ) ... )

So, for example, in the partition (3,1,1,1,1), we have one group of size 3 and four groups of size 1. So c1=1 (for size 3), c2=4 (for size 1).

Thus, the number of distinct partitions is 7! / (3!^1 * 1!^4 ) / (1! * 4! ), because for each group size, we divide by (mi! )^ci and then by ci! for the permutations of the groups.

Wait, let me make sure. The formula is:

Number of ways = [ n! / ( (m1! )^c1 * (m2! )^c2 * ... ) ] / ( c1! * c2! * ... )

So for the partition (3,1,1,1,1):

Number of ways = [7! / (3! * (1! )^4 ) ] / (1! * 4! )

Compute this:

7! = 5040

3! =6, (1! )^4=1, so denominator is 6*1=6.

So numerator: 5040 /6 = 840.

Then divide by (1! *4! )=1*24=24.

So 840 /24=35.

So for this partition, the number of ways is 35.

Now, for each group, we have to arrange them around the tables. Each group of size mi has (mi-1)! arrangements.

So for the group of size 3: (3-1)! =2! =2.

For each group of size 1: (1-1)! =0! =1.

So total arrangements per partition is 2 * 1^4 =2.

Thus, total ways for this partition: 35 * 2 =70.

Similarly, for the second partition (2,2,1,1,1):

Group sizes: two groups of size 2, three groups of size 1.

Number of ways to partition: [7! / (2!^2 * 1!^3 ) ] / (2! *3! )

Compute numerator:

7! =5040

2!^2=4, 1!^3=1, so denominator is 4*1=4.

5040 /4=1260.

Divide by (2! *3! )=2*6=12.

1260 /12=105.

Now, for each group, arrangements:

Each group of size 2: (2-1)! =1.

Each group of size 1: 1.

So total arrangements per partition: 1^2 *1^3 =1.

Thus, total ways for this partition: 105 *1=105.

Adding both partitions: 70 +105=175.

So the total number of ways is 175, which corresponds to option I.

The problem involves determining the number of ways to seat 7 people at 5 identical round tables, each with at least one person. To solve this, we consider the partitions of 7 into exactly 5 parts and calculate the arrangements for each partition.

### Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Identify Partitions**:  
   The partitions of 7 into 5 parts (each ≥1) are:
   - **Partition 1**: (3,1,1,1,1)
   - **Partition 2**: (2,2,1,1,1)

2. **Calculate Number of Ways for Each Partition**:  
   For each partition, compute the number of distinct ways to assign people and arrange them around the tables.

   - **Partition (3,1,1,1,1)**:
     - **Number of Assignments**:  
       Use the formula:  
       \[
       \frac{7!}{3! \cdot 1!^4} \div (1! \cdot 4!) = \frac{5040}{6} \div 24 = 840 \div 24 = 35
       \]
     - **Arrangements**:  
       Each group of size 3 has \( (3-1)! = 2! = 2 \) arrangements.  
       Each group of size 1 has \( (1-1)! = 1 \) arrangement.  
       Total arrangements: \( 2 \times 1^4 = 2 \).  
       Total ways: \( 35 \times 2 = 70 \).

   - **Partition (2,2,1,1,1)**:
     - **Number of Assignments**:  
       Use the formula:  
       \[
       \frac{7!}{(2!)^2 \cdot 1!^3} \div (2! \cdot 3!) = \frac{5040}{4} \div 12 = 1260 \div 12 = 105
       \]
     - **Arrangements**:  
       Each group of size 2 has \( (2-1)! = 1 \) arrangement.  
       Each group of size 1 has \( 1 \) arrangement.  
       Total arrangements: \( 1^2 \times 1^3 = 1 \).  
       Total ways: \( 105 \times 1 = 105 \).

3. **Sum the Results**:  
   Add the total ways from both partitions:  
   \[
   70 + 105 = 175
   \]

### Final Answer:
The number of ways is **175**, corresponding to option **I**.

Answer: I
