Okay, so I'm trying to solve this genetics problem here. Let me read it again and think through it step by step.

The question says: A dominant trait has a fitness of 0.6. The frequency in a population of this trait is 1 in 8,000. What is the mutation rate? The options are from A to J, with various values.

Hmm, I remember that mutation rates are often discussed in the context of allele frequencies and selection pressures. I think this might relate to mutation-selection balance. The mutation rate (u) and selection coefficient (s) are involved in determining the equilibrium frequency of a deleterious allele.

Wait, the fitness here is 0.6. Fitness is usually defined as 1 - s, where s is the selection coefficient against the allele. So if the fitness is 0.6, that means s = 0.4. Because 1 - s = 0.6 implies s = 0.4.

But wait, this is about a dominant trait. So if the trait is dominant, the heterozygote and the homozygote would express the same phenotype. So perhaps the fitness applies to both the heterozygote and the recessive homozygote? Or maybe the dominant homozygote is the one with fitness 0.6. Wait, no, usually the dominant allele is the advantageous one, but in this case, the fitness is lower than 1, so it's actually a deleterious allele. So perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, the trait is dominant, but the fitness is 0.6, which is less than 1. So the dominant allele is at a disadvantage. That's a bit confusing because usually dominant alleles are more fit. But maybe in this scenario, the dominant allele is deleterious.

So, in any case, the allele frequency is given. The frequency of the dominant trait is 1 in 8,000. But wait, allele frequency is usually denoted as q or p, depending on whether it's the recessive or dominant. Wait, if the dominant allele is at frequency q, then q = 1/8000 = 0.000125. Because 1 in 8,000 is 1/8000, which is 0.000125 or 1.25e-4.

But wait, sometimes the allele frequency is given as the frequency of the dominant phenotype. Since it's a dominant trait, the phenotype frequency would be higher than the allele frequency. Because both heterozygotes and dominant homozygotes show the dominant trait. So if the question says the frequency of the trait is 1/8000, that's the phenotype frequency, not the allele frequency.

Wait, that's a crucial point. So if the trait frequency is q² + 2pq (if the dominant allele is A and recessive a), but wait, no—if the trait is dominant, the frequency of the dominant phenotype is p² + 2pq, where p is the frequency of the dominant allele A, and q is the recessive allele a. Wait, no—wait, actually, p is the frequency of A and q is the frequency of a. So the dominant phenotype (A_) would be p² + 2pq. But if the trait is rare, perhaps the frequency is low, so maybe it's the recessive phenotype that's more common. Wait, but the question says the dominant trait is at frequency 1 in 8000, which is very low, so the dominant phenotype is rare. That would suggest that the dominant allele is rare and deleterious, which makes sense given the fitness is 0.6.

Wait, but wait—if the dominant allele is at a frequency of q, then the dominant phenotype frequency is q² + 2q(1 - q), which simplifies to q² + 2q - 2q² = 2q - q². Since q is small (1/8000 is 0.000125), q² is negligible, so the dominant phenotype frequency is approximately 2q. So if the phenotype frequency is 1/8000, then q ≈ (1/8000)/2 = 1/(16000) = 0.0000625, or 6.25e-5.

Wait, that's a key point. So the allele frequency q is approximately half the phenotype frequency when q is small. So if the trait frequency is 1/8000, then q ≈ 1/(2*8000) = 1/16000 = 6.25e-5.

Now, mutation-selection balance comes into play. The equilibrium frequency of a deleterious allele is given by q ≈ u/(hs), where h is the dominance coefficient. Wait, but I might be mixing up the formulas. Let me think.

In mutation-selection balance for a recessive allele, the equilibrium frequency is q ≈ u/(s), because the recessive allele only affects fitness in the homozygote. But for a dominant allele, the selection acts on the heterozygote as well, depending on the dominance. Wait, but in this case, the fitness is 0.6 for the dominant trait—so perhaps the fitness is for the dominant homozygote, and the heterozygote would have a fitness somewhere in between.

Wait, no, the problem states the fitness of the dominant trait is 0.6. So perhaps the fitness of the dominant allele is 0.6, which would imply that the selection coefficient s is 0.4. So the fitness of the AA genotype is 0.6, and perhaps the Aa genotype has a fitness higher than that if the trait is dominant. Wait, that can't be. If the dominant trait has lower fitness, then perhaps both AA and Aa have the same fitness. Or maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, perhaps the fitness given is for the dominant homozygote. So in that case, the selection coefficient s would be 0.4, as fitness is 0.6.

But I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to structure this.

The formula for mutation-selection balance for a dominant allele (where the heterozygote is also selected against) is q ≈ u/(h s), where h is the dominance coefficient. If the allele is completely dominant (h=1), then the heterozygote has the same fitness as the homozygote. So in that case, the equilibrium frequency q ≈ u/(h s).

Wait, but for a dominant deleterious allele, the selection against it occurs in both the heterozygote and the homozygote. So the equilibrium frequency would be when the input of new mutations is balanced by the removal of the allele via selection.

The formula I think is q = u / (h s). But I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, for a completely dominant allele, the heterozygote has the same fitness as the homozygote. So the fitness of AA is 1 - s, and Aa is also 1 - s. Then, the equilibrium frequency would be q ≈ u/(h s), but with h=1, so q = u/s.

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident. Let me think again.

In mutation-selection balance, the equilibrium frequency of a deleterious allele is q ≈ u/(h s), where h is the dominance coefficient. If the allele is recessive (h=0), then q ≈ u/s. If it's dominant (h=1), then q ≈ u/(s).

In this problem, the fitness of the dominant trait is 0.6, which is lower than 1, so it's deleterious. If the dominant allele is completely dominant, then both AA and Aa have fitness 0.6, meaning s=0.4. So the selection coefficient s = 0.4.

But wait, the frequency of the dominant trait (phenotype) is 1/8000. So the dominant phenotype frequency is q² + 2pq ≈ 2q (since q is small). So q ≈ (1/8000)/2 = 1/(16000) = 6.25e-5.

Now, using mutation-selection balance, q ≈ u/(h s). But I'm not sure what h is here. If the dominant allele is completely dominant, then h=1. So q = u/(s). So u = q * s.

Wait, wait. If q is the frequency of the dominant allele A, and the fitness of AA and Aa is 0.6, then s=0.4. So the equilibrium condition is q = u/(h s). But if the allele is completely dominant, h=1. So q = u/(s). So u = q * s.

Wait, but q is 6.25e-5, s=0.4. So u = 6.25e-5 * 0.4 = 2.5e-5.

Looking at the options, option A is 2.5 × 10^-5. So that's the answer.

Wait, but I should make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the steps. Let me recap.

1. Dominant trait's fitness is 0.6 → s=0.4 (since 1 - s = 0.6).
2. Phenotype frequency of dominant trait is 1/8000. Since the dominant phenotype is A_ (AA and Aa), and q is small, phenotype frequency ≈ 2q → q ≈ 1/(2*8000) = 6.25e-5.
3. Mutation-selection balance: q ≈ u/(h s). Assuming h=1 (completely dominant), q = u/(s) → u = q * s.
4. u = 6.25e-5 * 0.4 = 2.5e-5 → option A.
</think>

The problem involves determining the mutation rate for a dominant trait with a fitness of 0.6 and a frequency of 1 in 8,000. 

1. **Fitness and Selection Coefficient**: The fitness of the dominant trait is 0.6, implying the selection coefficient \( s = 1 - 0.6 = 0.4 \).

2. **Phenotype Frequency and Allele Frequency**: The dominant phenotype frequency is given as \( \frac{1}{8000} \). For a rare dominant allele, the phenotype frequency is approximately \( 2q \) (where \( q \) is the allele frequency). Thus, \( q \approx \frac{1}{2 \times 8000} = \frac{1}{16000} = 6.25 \times 10^{-5} \).

3. **Mutation-Selection Balance**: The equilibrium frequency of a deleterious allele is given by \( q = \frac{u}{h s} \), where \( h \) is the dominance coefficient. Assuming complete dominance (\( h = 1 \)), the formula simplifies to \( q = \frac{u}{s} \). Rearranging for \( u \), we get \( u = q \times s \).

4. **Calculating Mutation Rate**: Substituting \( q = 6.25 \times 10^{-5} \) and \( s = 0.4 \), the mutation rate is:
   \[
   u = (6.25 \times 10^{-5}) \times 0.4 = 2.5 \times 10^{-5}.
   \]

Thus, the mutation rate is \( 2.5 \times 10^{-5} \), corresponding to option **A**.
