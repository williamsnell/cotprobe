Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about pricing strategies, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me break it down step by step.

The question is asking where the price is set low relative to the competition to gain market share. The options given are A through J, each with a different pricing strategy.

First, I'll try to remember what each term means. I'll go through them one by one.

Option A: Captive product pricing. I think this refers to when a company sets its price in a way that it captures a market segment of its own. So, it's not about low prices relative to competitors, but instead about capturing a specific group of customers. So probably not this one.

Option B: High-low pricing. I'm not too sure about this. High-low is when a company sets a high price and then lowers it over time as they learn more about the market. I think it's more about negotiating prices over a period, not necessarily setting a low price relative to competition.

Option C: Price skimming. That sounds like it's a technique where a company charges a low price to test a product, then gradually increases it as they see demand. But I'm not sure if this is a strategy where you set a low price relative to competitors. Maybe not.

Option D: Value added pricing. This is when the price includes the cost of materials and labor, plus the value the company adds to the product. It's more about covering all costs and adding profit. So probably not the correct answer.

Option E: Penetration pricing. Oh, I remember this! Penetration pricing is when a company sets a low initial price to gain market share quickly. By offering a cheap product, they can attract customers and then increase the price later. So this seems to fit the description given in the question.

Option F: Premium pricing. I think premium pricing is when a product is priced significantly higher than competitors, giving it an exclusive status. So that's setting a high price, not low, relative to competitors. So F isn't the answer.

Option G: Cost-plus pricing. This is when the price is set by adding a markup to the cost. It's more about covering expenses and making a profit, not about setting a low price to gain market share. So G isn't the answer.

Option H: Economy pricing. I'm not too certain, but I think this term refers to setting a low price to attract customers, similar to penetration pricing. So maybe E is the answer, but I need to confirm.

Option I: Psychological pricing. This is when a product is priced at a level that seems unfair to consumers, based on psychological factors. It's a bit more of a marketing technique, not a pricing strategy aimed at gaining market share. So I don't think it's the correct term.

Option J: Competitive pricing. This seems like the opposite of what the question is asking. Competitive pricing is when a price is set close to another company's, which is the opposite of low relative to competitors. So J is probably not the answer.

Putting it all together, the term where the price is low relative to competition to gain market share is penetration pricing, which is option E. So I think the correct answer is E.

The correct answer is E: Penetration pricing. This strategy involves setting a low initial price to quickly gain market share by attracting customers and then increasing the price later. 

Answer: E
