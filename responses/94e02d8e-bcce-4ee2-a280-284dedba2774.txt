Okay, so I have this question about electric fields and force on a test charge. Hmm, let's try to break it down. 

The question is asking for the direction a positive test charge should move to experience maximum opposing or aiding force in the given electric field. The electric field E is given as E = -x a_x + y a_y + 3 a_z. Oh wait, so E is a vector with components in x, y, and z directions.

I remember that the force on a charge in an electric field is F = q E, where q is the charge and E is the electric field. Since the test charge is positive (q > 0), the force direction is the same as the electric field direction. But wait, the question isn't directly about the force direction; it's about the direction to move the charge to experience maximum opposing or aiding force. Hmm.

Wait, I think I need to consider the displacement direction. The force experienced by the charge is F = q (E · u) u, where u is the direction vector. Or wait, no. Oh right, the force is F = q E, but when considering movement, the work done by the electric field is F · d, which would be q E · d. So the maximum force would relate to the direction of the electric field.

Wait, but the question is about the direction of movement. So, the force experienced is F = q E. But since E is given, the direction of maximum force would be in the direction of E for aiding, and opposite for opposing.

Wait, no. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The force on the charge is proportional to E. So if the charge moves in the direction of E, the force would aid its motion. If it moves opposite, the force would oppose. But wait, no, because the force is F = q E, so the force is in the direction of E for positive charges. So if the charge is moved in the direction of E, the force is aiding; if against, opposing.

Wait, but the question is about the direction to move the charge, so to experience maximum opposing or aiding force. So the maximum force would be when the displacement direction (u) is aligned with E for aiding, because F would be qE * |u|, but wait, no, because F is just qE regardless of movement direction. Wait, but maybe I'm thinking of power or work. Wait, perhaps it's about the component of E in the direction of movement.

Wait, no, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The force magnitude is |q| |E|, and the direction is the same as E for positive charges. So the maximum force would be when the movement is in the direction of E (for aiding) and against for opposing. But wait, the force is a vector, so the direction of the force is fixed by E. So if the charge moves in the direction of E, the force is aiding; if opposite, opposing.

Wait, but the question is asking for the direction vector that the charge should move in to experience maximum opposing or aiding force. So the direction of movement (u) would determine whether the force aids or opposes the motion.

Wait, but the force is F = q E. So the direction of F is along E. So if the charge is moved in the direction of E, the force is aiding (same direction as motion). If moved opposite, force opposes.

But wait, the question is about the direction vector. So to get maximum aiding force, the displacement should be in the direction of E. For maximum opposing, in the opposite direction.

Wait, but E is given as E = -x a_x + y a_y + 3 a_z. So E has components in x, y, and z. So the direction vector u is E normalized. So first, I need to find the magnitude of E.

Wait, but wait. The point where the charge is at (1,3,-1). So E at that point is E = -1 a_x + 3 a_y +3 a_z. Because E is a function of position, right? Oh wait, wait, the given E is E = -x a_x + y a_y + 3 a_z. So at the point (1,3,-1), E would be E = (-1) a_x + 3 a_y +3 a_z. So E = (-1,3,3).

So the vector E at that point is (-1,3,3). The direction of maximum aiding force would be in the direction of E, so the unit vector in E's direction. Similarly, maximum opposing would be in the opposite direction, -E.

So first, let's find the unit vector in the direction of E. The vector E is (-1,3,3). The magnitude |E| is sqrt( (-1)^2 +3^2 +3^2 ) = sqrt(1 +9 +9) = sqrt(19) ≈ 4.3589.

So the unit vector u is E / |E| = (-1/sqrt(19), 3/sqrt(19), 3/sqrt(19)).

But wait, looking at the options, the options have positive components. So perhaps the direction is in the direction of E or opposite.

Wait, the options are given as A through J, each with two vectors, probably for (a) and (b).

Wait, but let me compute the components.

Compute each component:

-1/sqrt(19) ≈ -0.229

3/sqrt(19) ≈ 0.688

3/sqrt(19)≈ 0.688

So the unit vector is (-0.229, 0.688, 0.688). So this is the direction for maximum aiding force.

Wait, but wait. The unit vector is in the direction of E, so for part (a), maximum opposing force would be in the opposite direction, which is (0.229, -0.688, -0.688).

So looking at the options, let's see which option has these directions.

Looking at the options:

Option H: -0.229a_x + 0.688a_y + 0.688a_z, 0.229a_x -0.688a_y -0.688a_z.

Wait, the first vector is (-0.229, 0.688, 0.688), which is our E direction. The second is the opposite, which would be the direction for maximum opposing.

So for part (a), maximum opposing force would be in the direction opposite to E, so the unit vector would be (0.229, -0.688, -0.688).

Wait, but the way the question is phrased: part (a) is maximum opposing force, which would be when the movement is opposite to E. So the direction vector is (0.229, -0.688, -0.688), which is the second part of option H.

Wait, but option H is: first vector for (a), second for (b). Let me check option H.

Option H: (-0.229a_x + 0.688a_y + 0.688a_z), and (0.229a_x -0.688a_y -0.688a_z).

Wait, so the first vector is (-0.229, 0.688, 0.688), which is the direction of E, so movement in this direction would experience maximum aiding force, which would be part (b). The second vector in H is (0.229, -0.688, -0.688), which is opposite to E, so movement in this direction would experience maximum opposing force, which is part (a). 

Wait, but the question asks for (a) maximum opposing and (b) maximum aiding. So for part (a), the direction is the second vector of H, and part (b) is the first vector of H. So looking at the options, option H provides the correct vectors for (a) and (b). 

So the answer should be option H.

To determine the direction in which a positive test charge should move to experience maximum opposing or aiding force in the given electric field, we first calculate the electric field at the point (1, 3, -1). The electric field is given as:

\[
\mathbf{E} = -x \mathbf{a}_x + y \mathbf{a}_y + 3 \mathbf{a}_z
\]

At the point (1, 3, -1), substituting \(x = 1\), \(y = 3\), and \(z = -1\), we get:

\[
\mathbf{E} = -1 \mathbf{a}_x + 3 \mathbf{a}_y + 3 \mathbf{a}_z
\]

The magnitude of \(\mathbf{E}\) is:

\[
|\mathbf{E}| = \sqrt{(-1)^2 + 3^2 + 3^2} = \sqrt{1 + 9 + 9} = \sqrt{19}
\]

The unit vector in the direction of \(\mathbf{E}\) is:

\[
\hat{\mathbf{u}} = \frac{\mathbf{E}}{|\mathbf{E}|} = \left(-\frac{1}{\sqrt{19}}, \frac{3}{\sqrt{19}}, \frac{3}{\sqrt{19}}\right)
\]

Approximating the components:

\[
\hat{\mathbf{u}} \approx (-0.229, 0.688, 0.688)
\]

For maximum aiding force, the charge should move in the direction of \(\mathbf{E}\), which is \((-0.229, 0.688, 0.688)\). For maximum opposing force, the charge should move in the opposite direction, which is \((0.229, -0.688, -0.688)\).

Examining the options, option H provides the correct vectors:

- First vector: \(-0.229 \mathbf{a}_x + 0.688 \mathbf{a}_y + 0.688 \mathbf{a}_z\) (direction of \(\mathbf{E}\), aiding force).
- Second vector: \(0.229 \mathbf{a}_x - 0.688 \mathbf{a}_y - 0.688 \mathbf{a}_z\) (opposite direction of \(\mathbf{E}\), opposing force).

Thus, the correct answer is:

**H**

H
