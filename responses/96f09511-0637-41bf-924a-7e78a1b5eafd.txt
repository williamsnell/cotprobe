Alright, so I have this problem here: I need to find the shortest distance from the curve xy = 8 to the origin. The options are given as A through J, with various numerical values. Let me think through how to approach this.

First, I remember that the distance from a point to the origin can be found using the distance formula. If I have a point (x, y), the distance to the origin (0,0) is sqrt(x² + y²). So the problem is asking for the minimum value of sqrt(x² + y²) where the point (x, y) lies on the curve xy = 8.

Hmm, maybe I can use calculus for this. Since the square root function is increasing, the minimum of sqrt(x² + y²) will occur at the same point where x² + y² is minimized. So I can instead minimize the function f(x, y) = x² + y² subject to the constraint that xy = 8.

To solve this, I can use the method of Lagrange multipliers, which is a strategy for finding the local maxima and minima of a function subject to equality constraints. Alternatively, since the constraint is given by xy = 8, I can express y in terms of x and substitute it into the distance formula, then find the minimum with respect to x alone.

Let me try the substitution method because it might be simpler. From the equation xy = 8, I can solve for y: y = 8/x. Now, substituting this into the distance squared function (to avoid dealing with the square root, which complicates differentiation), I get f(x) = x² + (8/x)².

So f(x) = x² + 64/x². Now, I need to find the value of x that minimizes this function. To do that, I'll take the derivative of f(x) with respect to x and set it equal to zero.

Let's compute f'(x): the derivative of x² is 2x, and the derivative of 64/x² is 64*(-2)/x³, which simplifies to -128/x³. So f'(x) = 2x - 128/x³.

Setting f'(x) = 0: 2x - 128/x³ = 0. Let's solve for x.

Multiply both sides by x³ to eliminate the denominator: 2x * x³ - 128 = 0 => 2x⁴ - 128 = 0.

Simplify: 2x⁴ = 128 => x⁴ = 64 => x² = sqrt(64) => x² = 8. Wait, no, x⁴ = 64, so x² = sqrt(64) = 8? Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, because x⁴ is (x²)². So x⁴ = 64 implies x² = sqrt(64) which is 8, but actually, sqrt(64) is 8, but wait, no.

Wait, x⁴ = 64. So taking the square root of both sides gives x² = sqrt(64) = 8. So x² = 8, which means x = sqrt(8) or x = -sqrt(8). But since distance is positive, I can consider x positive because the curve xy=8 is symmetric in all four quadrants, but the closest point will be in the first quadrant where x and y are positive.

So x = sqrt(8) = 2*sqrt(2). Now, substituting back into y = 8/x, y = 8/(2*sqrt(2)) = 4/sqrt(2) = (4*sqrt(2))/2 = 2*sqrt(2).

So the point on the curve is (2*sqrt(2), 2*sqrt(2)). Now, the distance from this point to the origin is sqrt( (2√2)^2 + (2√2)^2 ) = sqrt( 8 + 8 ) = sqrt(16) = 4.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is 4. But wait, I thought the shortest distance would be sqrt(8), which is 2*sqrt(2), which is option B. Hmm, did I make a mistake here?

Wait, let me double-check. The distance squared is x² + y². We found that x = 2√2, y = 2√2, so x² = (2√2)^2 = 8, and same for y². So 8 + 8 = 16, so the distance is sqrt(16) = 4. So that's correct, but wait, another approach: maybe I can use the AM-GM inequality.

Wait, another way to approach this: since xy=8, and we want to minimize x² + y². Let me use substitution again. Let me denote y = 8/x, so x² + (8/x)^2 = x² + 64/x². Let me set t = x², so the function becomes t + 64/t. The minimum of t + 64/t occurs when the derivative with respect to t is zero. The derivative is 1 - 64/t². Setting to zero: 1 - 64/t² = 0 => t² = 64 => t = 8, since t is positive. So t = 8, so x² = 8, so x = 2√2. Then y = 8/(2√2) = 2√2, same as before. So the distance is sqrt(8 + 8) = sqrt(16) = 4. So that's consistent.

Wait, but earlier I thought the answer would be 2√2, which is option B. But according to this, it's 4, which is option A. So which is it?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the distance. Let me check again. If x = 2√2, then x² is (2√2)^2 = 4*2 = 8. Similarly, y² is also 8. So total is 16, sqrt(16) is 4. So the distance is indeed 4, which is option A.

Wait, but another way to think about this: the curve xy=8 is a hyperbola. The shortest distance from the origin to this hyperbola would be along the line that is perpendicular to the hyperbola at that point. Alternatively, perhaps using calculus of variations or parametric equations, but I think the substitution method is correct.

Alternatively, maybe using Lagrange multipliers. Let me try that.

We can set up the Lagrangian function L(x, y, λ) = x² + y² - λ(xy - 8). Taking partial derivatives:

∂L/∂x = 2x - λy = 0
∂L/∂y = 2y - λx = 0
∂L/∂λ = -(xy - 8) = 0

From the first equation: 2x = λy => λ = 2x/y
From the second equation: 2y = λx => substituting λ from above: 2y = (2x/y) * x => 2y = 2x² / y
Multiply both sides by y: 2y² = 2x² => y² = x² => y = ±x. Since we're considering the first quadrant, y = x.

Substituting into the constraint xy = 8: x * x = 8 => x² = 8 => x = 2√2, so y = 2√2 as before. Then the distance is sqrt( (2√2)^2 + (2√2)^2 ) = sqrt(8 + 8) = sqrt(16) = 4.

So again, the answer is 4, which is option A.

Wait, but I'm confused because earlier I thought the minimum might be 2√2. Let me check with specific points. For example, if x=2, then y=8/2=4. The distance is sqrt(4 + 16) = sqrt(20) ≈ 4.47, which is more than 4.

If x=√8, which is 2√2, then y=2√2, and distance is 4, which is less than 4.47. So that seems correct.

Alternatively, if x=4, y=2. Distance is sqrt(16 +4 )= sqrt(20), same as before.

Wait, but what if x approaches infinity? Then y approaches zero, and the distance approaches infinity. Similarly, as x approaches zero, y approaches infinity, distance also approaches infinity. So the minimal point must be somewhere in between, which we found at x=2√2, giving distance 4.

So the correct answer should be A:4.

The shortest distance from the curve \( xy = 8 \) to the origin is found by minimizing the distance function \( \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \). Substituting \( y = \frac{8}{x} \) into the distance formula and minimizing, we find the minimum occurs at \( x = 2\sqrt{2} \) and \( y = 2\sqrt{2} \), giving a distance of 4.
