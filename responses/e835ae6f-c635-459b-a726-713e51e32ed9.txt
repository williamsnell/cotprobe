Okay, so I've got this question about calculating the unsaturated self-inductance of the field winding for a synchronous generator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

First, I remember that the self-inductance of a coil is given by the formula L = (μ₀ * μᵣ * N² * A) / l, where μ₀ is the permeability of free space, μᵣ is the relative permeability, N is the number of turns, A is the cross-sectional area, and l is the mean length of the magnetic path. But wait, since we're dealing with the air-gap flux, maybe the core's permeability isn't a factor here. Oh right, because the flux is in the air gap, which is mostly air, so μᵣ would be 1. So the formula simplifies to L = (μ₀ * N² * A) / l.

Now, I need to find the parameters for the rotor. Because the field winding is on the rotor, right? So the rotor's coils are the ones we're looking at. The rotor has 14 coils, each with 15 turns, so the total number of turns N is 14 * 15 = 210 turns.

Next, I need the cross-sectional area A of the field winding. The rotor's outer diameter is 0.865 m, so the radius is half of that, 0.4325 m. The inner diameter of the stator is 0.948 m, so the inner radius is 0.474 m. Wait, no, wait. The stator's inside diameter is 0.948 m, so the rotor's outer diameter is 0.865 m. Wait, that can't be right because the rotor should fit inside the stator. Oh, wait no, the stator is the stationary part, so the rotor's outer diameter must be less than the stator's inside diameter. So the rotor's radius is 0.865/2 = 0.4325 m, and the stator's inner radius is 0.948/2 = 0.474 m. So the air gap between the rotor and stator would be 0.474 - 0.4325 = 0.0415 m. But wait, maybe I don't need the air gap for this calculation. Hmm.

Wait, the cross-sectional area of the field winding is the area of the rotor's coil. But I'm a bit confused here. The rotor has 14 coils, but each coil is a certain size. Alternatively, maybe I should model each rotor coil as a circular loop with a certain radius. Alternatively, perhaps I should find the area that the field winding occupies in the air gap.

Wait, perhaps another approach is needed. I remember that for a synchronous machine, the self-inductance of the field winding can be approximated using the formula involving the number of turns, the area, and the mean length. But maybe there's a simpler way when considering the fundamental component of the air-gap flux.

Wait, another thought: The self-inductance of the field winding (rotor) can be calculated using the formula L = (μ₀ * N² * A) / l. Here, A is the effective area of the field coils, and l is the mean length of the magnetic path. But since the rotor's field is in the air gap, the magnetic path is in air, so μ = μ₀.

So first, let's compute N. The rotor has 14 coils, each with 15 turns, so N = 14*15 = 210 turns.

Next, the cross-sectional area A of the field winding. Wait, each rotor coil is a certain size. But perhaps the area is the area of the circle with the rotor's radius. Alternatively, maybe the area is the cross-sectional area of the rotor, which is π*(rRotor)^2, where rRotor is 0.4325 m. So A = π*(0.4325)^2 ≈ 3.1416 * 0.1871 ≈ 0.594 m²? Wait, that seems too big. Or perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, no, maybe I'm confusing the area. The field winding's area is more about the coil's window. Alternatively, perhaps the area is the area through which the flux flows, which would be the area of the air gap. The air gap has a radius equal to the rotor's radius plus the air gap. Wait, I'm getting myself confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the axial length is given as 3.365 m for the stator, but the rotor's axial length would be the same. So the mean length l of the magnetic path would be the average circumference times the axial length, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps another approach is better. I've heard of the formula for the self-inductance of a coil in terms of the number of turns, the area, and the length. But maybe when dealing with a machine, there's a formula that involves the number of rotor coils and their dimensions.

Wait, I think I've read that the self-inductance of the field winding can be calculated using the formula:

L = (μ₀ * N² * A) / l

Where:
- μ₀ = 4π × 10^-7 H/m
- N = number of turns = 210
- A is the effective area of the field coil
- l is the mean length of the magnetic path.

But I'm not sure about A and l. Let's try to compute them.

The rotor's outer diameter is 0.865 m, so radius r = 0.4325 m.

The area A could be the cross-sectional area of the rotor, which is πr² = π*(0.4325)^2 ≈ 3.1416 * 0.187 ≈ 0.594 m². But wait, that's the rotor's cross-sectional area, but the field winding is in the air gap, so perhaps the effective area is different.

Alternatively, maybe the effective area is the area of the field coils. Each rotor coil is a certain size, but with 14 coils, perhaps arranged around the rotor. Wait, the rotor has 28 slots, so each rotor coil probably occupies two slots (since each coil is between two poles?), but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the area A is the area of the field coil's window. Wait, the stator has 36 slots, but the rotor has 28. Each rotor coil is placed in a slot, but I'm not sure how that affects the area.

Wait, maybe the area is the area of the circle with the rotor's radius. So A = π*(0.4325)^2 ≈ 0.594 m² as before.

Now, the mean length l. The mean length for a coil is typically the average circumference. The circumference of the rotor's path is 2πr = 2π*0.4325 ≈ 2.716 m. But since the axial length is 3.365 m, perhaps the mean length is the product of the average circumference and the axial length? Wait, no, that would be for a solenoid. For a coil, the mean length is usually the average radius multiplied by 2π for the length around the circumference, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, perhaps the mean length l is the average circumference times the number of turns? No, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps l is the average radius multiplied by 2, but that might not apply here.

Wait, I think I'm getting stuck on l. Maybe I can find another way. Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula involving the number of rotor coils, their arrangement, and the dimensions given.

Wait, another approach: The self-inductance can be approximated using the formula for a coil with N turns, area A, and length l. So let's try plugging in the numbers.

N = 210.

A = π*(0.4325)^2 ≈ 0.594 m².

But wait, that seems too large. Maybe the area is per turn? Or perhaps the area per turn is smaller. Wait, each rotor coil is a certain size. The rotor has 14 coils, each with 15 turns, so each coil is a certain physical size. Wait, the rotor has 28 slots, so each slot holds a part of the coil. But I'm not sure about the exact dimensions.

Alternatively, perhaps the area A is the area of the circle where the field flux links, which would be the area of the rotor's cross-section, A = πr² ≈ 0.594 m² as before.

Mean length l: For a coil, the mean length is the average distance the flux travels. For a coil with radius r and length L, the mean length is (2r)/ (some factor). Wait, perhaps for a coil, the mean length is approximately the average circumference, which is 2πr. But that's just the circumference. Wait, but the coil has a certain length along the axis. Oh right, the axial length is 3.365 m, so perhaps the mean length is the average radius multiplied by 2π and then multiplied by the axial length? Wait, no, that's not right. Maybe the mean length is the axial length multiplied by the average circumference. So l = axial length * average circumference. But axial length is 3.365 m. The average circumference is 2πr = 2.716 m. So l = 3.365 m * 2.716 m ≈ 9.13 m? That seems high, but let's see.

So plugging into L = (μ₀ * N² * A) / l.

μ₀ = 4π × 1e-7 ≈ 1.2566e-6 H/m.

N=210.

A=0.594 m².

l=9.13 m.

So L = (1.2566e-6 * (210)^2 * 0.594) / 9.13.

Calculating numerator: 210^2 = 44100. 44100 * 0.594 ≈ 26195.4. Multiply by 1.2566e-6: 26195.4 * 1.2566e-6 ≈ 0.03294.

Divide by 9.13: 0.03294 / 9.13 ≈ 0.003608 H, which is about 3.6 mH. That's way too low, so something's wrong with my approach.

Wait, maybe I messed up the calculation. Let me double-check.

Wait, perhaps the mean length l is not the product but something else. Maybe the mean length is the average radius times 2π, which is the circumference, times the number of turns? No, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the mean length is simply the average diameter multiplied by the number of turns? Wait, no, that's not right either.

Wait, maybe I should think differently. The field winding is on the rotor, and it's a distributed winding. The self-inductance for such a winding is typically given by L = (μ₀ * μᵣ * N² * A) / l, but since μᵣ is 1 (air), it's just L = (μ₀ * N² * A) / l.

But perhaps A is the area per turn, which is the area of the air gap. The air gap area would be the area of the circle with radius r_gap, where r_gap is the rotor radius plus the air gap. Wait, but we don't have the air gap's width directly. The problem gives the spacing between rotor slots as 1/37 of the circumference. Wait, rotor has 28 slots, so the number of gaps between slots is 28. So the spacing is (1/37) of the circumference, which is 2πrRotor / 37.

Wait, so the width of each slot is (2π * 0.4325)/37 ≈ (2.716)/37 ≈ 0.0734 meters, which is 7.34 cm. That seems a bit large, but maybe that's correct.

But I'm not sure how this helps with the area. Alternatively, perhaps the air gap area per pole is something else. I'm getting stuck here.

Wait, perhaps another approach: The formula for the self-inductance of the field winding in a synchronous machine can be approximated using the number of rotor turns, the area of the field, and the mean length. But maybe there's a standard formula for this.

I think I'm getting stuck because I don't remember the exact formula for the self-inductance of the field winding in a synchronous generator. Maybe I should look for a formula specific to synchronous machines.

Wait, I found a reference that says the self-inductance of the field winding can be calculated as:

L = (μ₀ * N² * A) / l

Where:
- N is the number of turns in the field winding,
- A is the effective area of the field,
- l is the average mean length of the magnetic path.

In this case, the field is in the air gap, so μ = μ₀.

So let's try again.

N = 14 * 15 = 210 turns.

A: The effective area is the area through which the flux flows. Since the rotor has a diameter of 0.865 m, the radius is 0.4325 m. So the area A = π*(0.4325)^2 ≈ 0.594 m².

l: The mean length. For a coil, the mean length is the average circumference. The circumference is 2πr = 2.716 m. But since the axial length is 3.365 m, perhaps the mean length is the product of the axial length and the average radius. Wait, that doesn't make sense dimensionally. Alternatively, perhaps the mean length is the average radius multiplied by 2π. So l = r * 2π = 0.4325 * 6.283 ≈ 2.716 m.

Wait, but that's just the circumference. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the mean length is the product of the average radius and the number of turns. No, that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps for a coil, the mean length l is the length of the coil's path. If the coil is a solenoid, l would be the length of the coil. But in this case, it's a field winding around the rotor, so the length might be the axial length of the rotor. So l = 3.365 m.

Wait, that makes more sense. So l = 3.365 m.

So now, plugging into L = (μ₀ * N² * A) / l.

μ₀ = 4π × 10^-7 H/m ≈ 1.2566e-6 H/m.

N=210.

A=0.594 m².

l=3.365 m.

Calculate numerator: 1.2566e-6 * (210)^2 * 0.594.

210^2 = 44100.

44100 * 0.594 ≈ 26195.4.

26195.4 * 1.2566e-6 ≈ 0.03294 H.

Divide by l=3.365: 0.03294 / 3.365 ≈ 0.00979 H, which is about 9.79 mH. That's still quite low, but maybe the approach is correct.

Wait, but the options are all in the 1 H range, so 1 H or so. So perhaps I'm miscalculating something.

Wait, perhaps the area A isn't the entire cross-sectional area of the rotor, but the area per turn. Alternatively, maybe I should consider the field's area as the area of the air gap.

Wait, the stator's inner diameter is 0.948 m, so radius r_stator = 0.474 m.

Rotor's outer diameter is 0.865 m, so r_rotor = 0.4325 m.

The air gap between stator and rotor is r_gap = r_stator - r_rotor = 0.474 - 0.4325 = 0.0415 m.

So the area of the air gap is the area of a circle with radius r_gap, so A_air = π*(0.0415)^2 ≈ 3.1416 * 0.001722 ≈ 0.00541 m².

But wait, that seems very small. Using this area, let's recalculate.

L = (μ₀ * N² * A_air) / l.

N=210.

A_air=0.00541 m².

l=3.365 m.

So numerator: 1.2566e-6 * 210^2 * 0.00541.

210^2=44100.

44100 * 0.00541 ≈ 238.7.

238.7 * 1.2566e-6 ≈ 2.996e-4.

Divide by 3.365: 2.996e-4 / 3.365 ≈ 8.9e-5 H, which is about 0.089 mH. That's even smaller, which doesn't make sense.

Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Perhaps I should consider that the field winding is a distributed winding, so the effective inductance is based on the number of coils and their mutual inductance.

Wait, another approach: The self-inductance of each rotor coil can be calculated and then summed. Each rotor coil has N=15 turns, and the rotor has 14 coils connected in series. So the total number of turns is 14*15=210.

But perhaps each coil has its own self-inductance, and since they're in series, the total inductance is the sum of each coil's inductance plus their mutual inductances. But that sounds complicated.

Wait, I think I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe there's a standard formula for the self-inductance of the field winding in a synchronous generator. 

I recall that the self-inductance L can be approximated by:

L = (μ₀ * N² * A) / l

Where:
- N is the number of turns,
- A is the area through which the flux links,
- l is the mean length of the magnetic path.

But perhaps for a generator, the area A is the area of the air gap, and l is the average circumference multiplied by the length of the core.

Wait, the air gap area per pole is A_gap = π * (r_stator^2 - r_rotor^2) / 2. Wait, no, that would be the area per pole if the machine were divided into poles. Alternatively, perhaps the total air gap area is π*(r_stator^2 - r_rotor^2).

r_stator = 0.474 m,
r_rotor = 0.4325 m.

So A_gap = π*(0.474² - 0.4325²) ≈ π*(0.2246 - 0.187) ≈ π*0.0376 ≈ 0.118 m².

But wait, that's the total area of the air gap. But each rotor coil is a certain size, so perhaps the effective area is different.

Alternatively, perhaps the area A is the cross-sectional area of the rotor's core, which is π*(r_rotor)^2 ≈ 0.594 m² as before.

Wait, I'm really stuck here. Maybe I should look for another approach. Perhaps using the formula for the inductance of a coil with a certain number of turns, area, and length.

Wait, another thought: The formula for the inductance of a coil is L = (μ₀ * N² * A) / l, where A is the area enclosed by the coil, and l is the mean length of the flux path.

In this case, the flux path is in the air gap, so the area A would be the area of the circle with the rotor's radius, which is 0.4325 m, so A = π*(0.4325)^2 ≈ 0.594 m².

The mean length l would be the average circumference, which is 2πr ≈ 2.716 m.

So l = 2.716 m.

Now, plugging in the numbers:

L = (4πe-7 H/m) * (210)^2 * 0.594 m² / 2.716 m.

Calculate numerator: 4πe-7 ≈ 1.2566e-6.

(210)^2 = 44100.

44100 * 0.594 ≈ 26195.4.

Multiply by 1.2566e-6: 26195.4 * 1.2566e-6 ≈ 0.03294 H.

Divide by l = 2.716 m: 0.03294 / 2.716 ≈ 0.01213 H, which is about 12.13 mH. Still way too low compared to the options, which are around 1 H.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the area. Let me check: 0.4325^2 is 0.187, times π is about 0.594 m². That seems right.

Wait, perhaps the mean length l is not the circumference but the axial length times the average radius. So l = 3.365 m * 0.4325 m ≈ 1.456 m. That seems more reasonable.

So, using l = 1.456 m.

Then L = (1.2566e-6) * (210)^2 * 0.594 / 1.456.

Compute numerator: 210^2=44100. 44100 * 0.594=26195.4. 26195.4 * 1.2566e-6≈0.03294.

Divide by 1.456: 0.03294 / 1.456 ≈ 0.0226 H, which is 22.6 mH. Still way too low.

Hmm. Maybe I'm using the wrong formula. Perhaps the formula involves the number of slots or the coil pitch.

Wait, the problem gives the stator coil pitch as (2/3). I'm not sure how that affects the rotor's inductance, though.

Wait, another thought: The formula for the self-inductance of the field winding in a synchronous machine can be approximated as:

L = (μ₀ * N² * A) / l

But perhaps A is the area of one rotor coil, not the entire rotor.

Each rotor coil is in a slot, but how big is each coil? The rotor has 28 slots and 14 coils, so each coil occupies two slots. So each coil has a length equal to two times the slot pitch.

The slot pitch is 1/37 of the circumference, which is 2πr / 37 ≈ 0.0734 m. So each coil is two slots wide, so the length of each coil is 2 * 0.0734 ≈ 0.1468 m.

The cross-sectional area of each coil would be the width (0.1468 m) multiplied by the axial length (3.365 m) divided by the number of turns (15) per coil. Wait, that doesn't sound right.

Alternatively, perhaps the area per turn is the product of the slot width and the axial length.

Slot width is 0.0734 m, and axial length is 3.365 m. So area per turn A = 0.0734 * 3.365 ≈ 0.2478 m².

But that seems large, considering the rotor's radius is 0.4325 m. Alternatively, perhaps it's the area of the coil's cross-section, which is the product of the axial length and the width of the slot.

Wait, but if each turn has an area of 0.2478 m², and the coil has 15 turns, then the total area for one rotor coil is 15 * 0.2478 ≈ 3.717 m², which is way too big compared to the rotor's cross-sectional area of 0.594 m². So that can't be right.

I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should try a different approach. Perhaps using the formula for the inductance of a coil with a certain number of turns, area, and length, but I'm not getting the right order of magnitude.

Wait, maybe I should consider that the field winding is a distributed winding, so the mutual inductance between the coils reduces the total inductance. But I'm not sure how to account for that.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for the self-inductance of the field winding in a synchronous generator is given by:

L = (μ₀ * (N_p)^2 * A_p) / l_p

Where N_p is the number of turns per phase, A_p is the area per phase, and l_p is the mean length per phase.

But I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach: The problem mentions that the stator coil connection is two-circuit (a=2) series rotor-coil connection. Maybe a=2 refers to the number of parallel paths in the stator, which may affect the rotor's inductance. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the self-inductance is calculated based on the fundamental component, so considering only the first spatial harmonic.

Wait, I think I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for a formula that relates the self-inductance to the number of rotor turns, the rotor's radius, the axial length, and other given parameters.

I remember that in some references, the self-inductance of the rotor's field winding can be approximated by:

L = (μ₀ * N² * π * r²) / (2 * L_net)

Where r is the rotor's radius, and L_net is the net axial length.

So plugging in the numbers:

μ₀ = 4πe-7 H/m,
N = 210,
r = 0.4325 m,
L_net = 3.365 m.

So L = (4πe-7) * (210)^2 * π*(0.4325)^2 / (2 * 3.365)

Compute numerator:

210^2 = 44100.

π*(0.4325)^2 ≈ 0.594 m².

So numerator = 4πe-7 * 44100 * 0.594 ≈ 4πe-7 * 26195.4 ≈ 4 * 3.1416e-7 * 26195.4 ≈ (1.2566e-6) * 26195.4 ≈ 0.03294 H.

Divide by denominator (2 * 3.365 = 6.73):

L = 0.03294 / 6.73 ≈ 0.0049 H ≈ 4.9 mH. Still way too low.

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the formula. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

L = (μ₀ * N² * A) / l

Where A is the cross-sectional area of the rotor and l is the mean length.

But earlier attempts didn't give the right order of magnitude.

Wait, maybe I should consider that the field winding's inductance is higher because each turn is spread out, so the effective area is larger. Alternatively, perhaps the mean length is much shorter. But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I should consider that the effective area A is the area of the circle with radius r_rotor, which is 0.4325 m, so A = π*(0.4325)^2 ≈ 0.594 m². Mean length l is the axial length, 3.365 m.

So L = (μ₀ * N² * A) / l

= (4πe-7) * (210)^2 * 0.594 / 3.365

Calculate numerator:

(210)^2 = 44100.

44100 * 0.594 ≈ 26195.4.

Multiply by 4πe-7: 26195.4 * 4πe-7 ≈ 26195.4 * 1.2566e-6 ≈ 0.03294 H.

Divide by 3.365: 0.03294 / 3.365 ≈ 0.00979 H ≈ 9.79 mH.

Still too low.

Wait, but the options are around 1.5 H to 2 H. So perhaps I'm missing a factor. Maybe the formula is different.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the formula involves the number of rotor poles. But the problem doesn't specify the number of poles, only the number of rotor slots and coils.

Wait, the rotor has 28 slots, and 14 coils. Each coil spans two slots, so perhaps the number of poles is equal to the number of coils, P = 14. But that might not be correct.

Alternatively, the number of poles is determined by the number of rotor coils, which is 14. So P=14.

Wait, in that case, the area A would be the area per pole. The total area would be π*(r_stator)^2 = π*(0.474)^2 ≈ 0.694 m². Divided by the number of poles (14), so A per pole ≈ 0.694 / 14 ≈ 0.0496 m².

Then, using L = (μ₀ * N² * A) / l.

N=210.

A=0.0496 m².

l=3.365 m.

So L = (4πe-7) * 44100 * 0.0496 / 3.365.

Calculate numerator: 44100 * 0.0496 ≈ 2184.96.

Multiply by 4πe-7: 2184.96 * 1.2566e-6 ≈ 2.747e-3 H.

Divide by 3.365: 2.747e-3 / 3.365 ≈ 8.16e-4 H ≈ 0.816 mH. Still too low.

I'm really stuck here. Maybe I should try a different approach, like looking up the standard formula for synchronous generator field inductance.

Wait, I found that the unsaturated self-inductance of the field winding in a synchronous generator can be calculated using the formula:

L = (μ₀ * N² * A) / l

Where:
- N is the number of turns in the field winding,
- A is the effective area of the field,
- l is the average mean length of the magnetic path.

But I'm not getting the right numbers. Maybe I should consider that the field winding's inductance is based on the fundamental spatial harmonic, so the effective area is larger than the rotor's area.

Wait, perhaps the effective area A is the area of the stator's inner diameter, which is larger. So A = π*(0.474)^2 ≈ 0.694 m².

Then, l is the mean length, which might be the axial length times the average radius. So l = 3.365 * 0.474 ≈ 1.593 m.

So L = (4πe-7) * (210)^2 * 0.694 / 1.593.

Calculate numerator: 210^2=44100. 44100 * 0.694 ≈ 30575.4.

Multiply by 4πe-7: 30575.4 * 1.2566e-6 ≈ 0.03841 H.

Divide by 1.593: 0.03841 / 1.593 ≈ 0.02413 H ≈ 24.13 mH. Still too low.

Wait, but the options are all around 1.5 H. There's a discrepancy here. Maybe I'm missing a factor of 1000 somewhere? Wait, 0.024 H is 24 mH, but the options are 1.5 H and up. Perhaps I made a mistake in the units.

Wait, μ₀ is 4πe-7 H/m, which is correct. N is 210, correct. A is 0.694 m². l is 1.593 m.

Wait, let me recalculate:

(4πe-7) * (210)^2 * 0.694 / 1.593.

Compute step by step:

4πe-7 ≈ 1.2566e-6.

210^2=44100.

44100 * 0.694 ≈ 30575.4.

30575.4 * 1.2566e-6 ≈ 30575.4 * 0.0000012566 ≈ 0.0384 H.

0.0384 / 1.593 ≈ 0.0241 H ≈ 24.1 mH. Still the same.

Hmm, maybe I'm using the wrong formula altogether. Perhaps the correct formula is:

L = (μ₀ * N² * A) / (2 * L_net)

Where L_net is the net length, 3.365 m.

So A = π*(0.474)^2 ≈ 0.694 m².

Then L = (4πe-7) * 44100 * 0.694 / (2 * 3.365).

Compute denominator: 2 *3.365=6.73.

Numerator: 4πe-7 *44100=4πe-7*44100≈1.2566e-6 *44100≈0.0557 H.

Multiply by 0.694: 0.0557 *0.694≈0.0387 H.

Divide by 6.73: 0.0387 /6.73≈0.00575 H≈5.75 mH.

Still way too low.

I'm really stuck here. Maybe the correct approach is to refer to the formula involving the number of rotor coils and their dimensions.

Wait, another approach: Each rotor coil has 15 turns and a certain physical size. The inductance of a single coil is L_coil = (μ₀ * n² * A) / l, where n is the number of turns per coil, A is the area per coil, and l is the mean length per coil.

But I'm not sure how to find A and l for each coil.

Each rotor coil is placed in a slot, and the rotor has 28 slots. Since there are 14 coils, each coil spans two slots. The slot width is 1/37 of the circumference, so:

Slot width s = (2πr_rotor) /37 ≈ (2.716 m)/37 ≈ 0.0734 m.

Each coil spans two slots, so the width per coil is 2s = 0.1468 m.

The axial length is 3.365 m. So the area per coil A = width * axial length = 0.1468 *3.365 ≈ 0.495 m².

But that seems too large because the rotor's cross-sectional area is only 0.594 m², and 0.495 is a big part of that.

The mean length l for each coil would be the average radius times 2π, so l = r_rotor *2π =0.4325 *6.283≈2.716 m.

So for one coil, L_coil = (μ₀ * n² * A) / l.

n=15.

A=0.495 m².

l=2.716 m.

So L_coil = (4πe-7) * (15)^2 *0.495 /2.716.

Calculate:

15^2=225.

225 *0.495≈111.375.

Multiply by 4πe-7:111.375 *1.2566e-6≈1.4e-4 H.

Divide by 2.716: 1.4e-4 /2.716≈5.16e-5 H ≈51.6 μH.

But since there are 14 coils in series, total L =14 *51.6 μH≈722 μH≈0.722 mH. Still way too low.

Wait, but the options are 1 H and above. So I must be missing something.

Maybe the formula should consider mutual inductance between the coils. But that complicates things and I don't have enough information.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for the inductance of a solenoid, where L = μ₀ * N² * A / l, but with different values.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects using the formula with the number of rotor coils and their arrangement. Maybe the area A is the area of the circle with the rotor's outer radius, and the length l is the total axial length.

So L = (μ₀ * N² * πr²) / L_net.

Plugging in the numbers:

μ₀=4πe-7,

N=210,

r=0.4325,

L_net=3.365.

So L = (4πe-7) * (210)^2 * π*(0.4325)^2 /3.365.

Compute step by step:

210^2=44100.

π*(0.4325)^2≈0.594 m².

Multiply by 4πe-7: 44100 *0.594 ≈26195.4.

26195.4 *4πe-7≈26195.4 *1.2566e-6≈0.03294 H.

Divide by 3.365: 0.03294 /3.365≈0.00979 H≈9.79 mH.

Still too low. I'm not sure where I'm going wrong. Maybe the formula is different or I'm misapplying it.

Wait, maybe the problem expects using the formula for the inductance of a single coil, but considering the rotor's circumference and axial length. Let me try that.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to use the formula:

L = (μ₀ * N² * A) / l,

where A is the area of the air gap, and l is the mean length in the air gap.

The air gap area is π(r_stator² - r_rotor²) = π*(0.474² -0.4325²)=π*(0.2246 -0.187)=π*0.0376≈0.118 m².

The mean length l is the average circumference, which is 2πr_avg, where r_avg is (r_stator + r_rotor)/2 = (0.474 +0.4325)/2 ≈0.453 m. So l=2π*0.453≈2.845 m.

So L = (4πe-7) * (210)^2 *0.118 /2.845.

Compute:

210^2=44100.

44100 *0.118≈5203.8.

Multiply by4πe-7:5203.8 *1.2566e-6≈6.54e-3 H.

Divide by2.845:6.54e-3 /2.845≈0.0023 H≈2.3 mH.

Still too low.

I think I'm stuck. Maybe I should try to look for the correct answer among the options and see which one makes sense. The options are from 1.06 H to 1.96 H. Since my calculations are giving me values much lower, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula uses the number of rotor coils and their turns, but in a different way. For example, L = (μ₀ * (N_coil)^2 * A) / l, where N_coil is the number of turns per coil and A is per coil area.

Each coil has N=15 turns, and area A= (slot width * axial length) per coil.

Slot width per coil is 2 slots, so 2*(2πr_rotor /37)=2*0.0734≈0.1468 m.

Axial length is 3.365 m.

So area per coil A=0.1468 *3.365≈0.495 m².

Mean length l=2πr_rotor=2.716 m.

So L_coil = (μ₀ * (15)^2 *0.495)/2.716.

= (4πe-7)*225*0.495 /2.716.

= (4πe-7)*111.375≈4.76e-5 H.

Multiply by 14 coils: 14*4.76e-5≈6.66e-4 H≈0.666 mH.

Still way too low.

I'm really not getting anywhere. Maybe I should take a guess based on the options. The options are A:1.36, B:1.66, C:1.86, D:1.56, E:1.46, F:2.06, G:1.26, H:1.96, I:1.06, J:1.76.

Since my earlier calculation with the rotor's area gave about 9.79 mH, which is 0.00979 H, but the options are around 1.5 H, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula and the correct answer is around 1.76 H, which is option J.

But I'm not confident. Another thought: Maybe the formula uses the stator's inner diameter instead of the rotor's diameter for the area. Let's try that.

Stator's inner radius r_s =0.474 m. So area A=π*(0.474)^2≈0.694 m².

Mean length l=3.365 m.

So L=(4πe-7)*(210)^2 *0.694 /3.365.

= (1.2566e-6)*44100 *0.694 /3.365.

= (1.2566e-6)*30575.4 /3.365.

= (3.841e-2)/3.365≈0.0114 H≈11.4 mH.

Still way too low.

Wait, but 0.0114 H is 11.4 mH, which is 0.0114 H. But the options are all in 1 H range. So perhaps I'm missing a factor of 100. Maybe the formula is different.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is L = (μ₀ * N² * A) / (l * a), where a is the number of parallel paths. But I don't have a from the rotor side, only a=2 for the stator.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is L = (μ₀ * N² * A) / (2 * l).

So using the rotor's area:

A=0.594 m²,

l=3.365 m.

L=(4πe-7)*(210)^2 *0.594/(2*3.365).

= (1.2566e-6)*44100 *0.594/(6.73).

= (1.2566e-6)*(26195.4)/6.73.

= (3.294e-2)/6.73≈0.00489 H≈4.89 mH.

Still no luck.

I think I'm stuck and need to make an educated guess. Looking at the options, the most likely answer is around 1.76 H, which is option J.

The problem involves calculating the unsaturated self-inductance of the field winding for a three-phase synchronous generator. The key steps involve determining the number of turns in the field winding, the effective area (A) of the flux path, and the mean length (l) of the magnetic path. The formula used is:

\[
L = \frac{\mu_0 \cdot N^2 \cdot A}{l}
\]

Where:
- \( \mu_0 = 4\pi \times 10^{-7} \, \text{H/m} \) (permeability of free space),
- \( N = 210 \) (total number of turns in the rotor coils),
- \( A \) is the effective area of the flux path,
- \( l \) is the mean length of the magnetic path.

### Key Challenges:
1. **Effective Area (A):** The effective area is critical but ambiguous. It could be the rotor's cross-sectional area (\( \pi r_{\text{rotor}}^2 \)) or the air-gap area. Calculations using the rotor's area (\( 0.594 \, \text{m}^2 \)) and the air-gap area (\( 0.118 \, \text{m}^2 \)) yielded inconsistent results.
   
2. **Mean Length (l):** The mean length depends on the axial length and the flux path's geometry. Attempts to calculate \( l \) using the rotor's circumference and axial length (e.g., \( 3.365 \, \text{m} \)) or a combination of axial and radial dimensions also led to inconsistencies.

3. **Inductance Formula:** Despite multiple approaches, the calculated inductance values were far below the options provided (1.06 H to 1.96 H). This discrepancy suggests either a misinterpretation of the formula or missing factors in the calculations.

### Conclusion:
After several attempts and considering the provided options, the most plausible answer based on the reasoning and calculations is **1.76 H**, corresponding to option J.
