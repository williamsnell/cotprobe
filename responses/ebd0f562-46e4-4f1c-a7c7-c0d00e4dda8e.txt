D: 353.8 K
E: 299.2 K

Okay, so I've got this problem about a platinum-resistance thermometer. Hmm, I remember that these thermometers work based on the change in resistance with temperature. The problem says that the resistance is 9.20 ohms when it's in a triple-point cell, and then it's 12.40 ohms somewhere else. I need to find the temperature it shows in that second situation.

Wait, the triple-point cell is probably a standard reference point. I think the triple point of water is 273.16 K, right? So that's the temperature when the resistance is 9.20 ohms. So that's our reference point.

I need to find the temperature when the resistance is 12.40 ohms. I remember there's a formula for the resistance of platinum thermometers. Oh yeah, it's something like R = R0 * (1 + α(T - T0)), where R0 is the resistance at a reference temperature T0, α is the temperature coefficient, and T is the temperature we want to find.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact formula. Alternatively, maybe it's R = R0 + α * (T - T0) * R0? Or is it R = R0 (1 + α (T - T0))? I think it's the latter. So R is proportional to 1 + alpha times (T - T0).

But wait, I don't know the value of alpha. Hmm, maybe I can calculate it using the given data. Because I have R0 as 9.20 ohms at T0=273.16 K, and another R at some T. But wait, the problem doesn't give another data point. Wait, no, the second resistance is when it's placed elsewhere, but I don't have its temperature. So maybe I should use a standard formula or a known table for platinum resistance thermometers.

Wait, I think the IEC standard for platinum resistance thermometers defines the relationship between resistance and temperature. The formula is R = R0 (1 + 0.00390832 + 0.0000005772 (T - 273.15)), where R0 is the resistance at 273.15 K. Alternatively, sometimes it's approximated as R = R0 (1 + α (T - T0)), where α is about 0.00392 per Kelvin. Or maybe 0.003908?

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to think. The triple-point cell is 273.16 K, so I'll take T0 as 273.16 K, R0 as 9.20 ohms. When the resistance is 12.40 ohms, what's T?

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the linear approximation. So the change in resistance is 12.40 - 9.20 = 3.20 ohms. The fraction is 3.20 / 9.20 ≈ 0.3478. So if I can find the temperature increase corresponding to this fraction, I can add it to 273.16 K.

But I need to know the alpha value for platinum. I think the standard alpha for platinum is about 0.00392 per Kelvin. So alpha ≈ 0.00392 K⁻¹.

So using R = R0 (1 + alpha (T - T0)). Let's rearrange to solve for T.

R = R0 (1 + alpha (T - T0)) → (R/R0) = 1 + alpha (T - T0) → T = T0 + (R/R0 - 1)/alpha.

Plugging in the numbers: R = 12.40, R0=9.20.

R/R0 = 12.40 /9.20 ≈ 1.3478.

So (1.3478 - 1) = 0.3478.

Divide by alpha: 0.3478 / 0.00392 ≈ let's calculate that.

0.3478 / 0.00392 ≈ 88.7647.

So T ≈ 273.16 K + 88.7647 ≈ 361.9247 K. Hmm, but none of the options are exactly that. Wait, looking at the options, F is 368.1 K, which is higher, and D is 353.8 K, which is lower. Wait, maybe my alpha is wrong.

Wait, perhaps the alpha is 0.00390832 per Kelvin, as per the IEC standard. Let me try that.

So alpha = 0.00390832.

So (R/R0 -1) = 12.40/9.20 -1 = 0.3478 as before.

Then (0.3478) / 0.00390832 ≈ let's compute that.

0.3478 / 0.00390832 ≈ 89.01 K.

So T = 273.16 + 89.01 ≈ 362.17 K. Hmm, again, none of the options match exactly. The closest option is F: 368.1 K, but that's about 6 K higher.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in using the formula. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is different. Oh wait, wait, the correct formula for the platinum resistance is R = R0 (1 + a(T - T0)) + (a²/2)(T - T0)^2, but that's the more precise version. But maybe for small temperature ranges, the linear approximation is sufficient.

Alternatively, maybe I should use the inverse approach. Let me check the options. The options given are A: 404.8 K, B: 273.16 K, C:345.2, D:353.8, E:299.2, F:368.1, G:390.7, H:400.3, I:330.5, J:312.0.

Wait, perhaps I should check the change in resistance. So from 9.20 to 12.40 is an increase of (12.40 /9.20) = 1.3478.

Wait, if I use the formula T = T0 + (R - R0)/(R0 * α).

Wait, wait, R0 is 9.20 at T0=273.16. So (R - R0) is 3.20 ohms. So (3.20)/(9.20 * α). Let me recalculate with alpha=0.00390832.

So 3.20 / (9.20 * 0.00390832) = 3.20 / (0.03614) ≈ 88.55 K. So T ≈ 273.16 + 88.55 ≈ 361.71 K. Still not matching any option.

Wait, maybe the problem is using a different alpha value. Alternatively, perhaps it's using the 1968 Callendar-Van Dommelen equation, which is R = R0 (1 + a(T - T0) + b (T - T0)^2).

But without knowing the exact coefficients, this might be complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the linear approximation with a specific alpha.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the α value of 0.00392 per K. Let me try that again.

So alpha=0.00392. (12.40/9.20 -1) = 0.3478. 0.3478 / 0.00392 ≈ 88.76 K. So T=273.16 +88.76=361.92 K. Again, no option matches.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating. Let me redo the division: 0.3478 divided by 0.00392.

0.00392 × 88 = 0.345, because 0.00392 * 80=0.3136, 0.00392*8=0.03136, total 0.34496. So 88 gives 0.34496, which is a bit less than 0.3478. So 88 gives 0.34496, 89 gives 0.34888 (0.00392*89=0.34888). So 0.3478 is between 88 and 89, closer to 88.75.

So 88.75 K added to 273.16 gives 361.91 K. So I'm getting around 362 K, but the options don't have that. The closest is F: 368.1 K, which is higher by about 6 K.

Hmm, maybe I'm using the wrong approach. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the inverse, using the reciprocal formula. Alternatively, maybe the formula is R = R0 * (1 + a (T - T_ref)), where T_ref is 0°C (273.15 K), and a is 0.00392.

Wait, perhaps the given options are using a different alpha. Alternatively, maybe the problem uses a different reference point.

Wait, perhaps the formula is R = R0 (1 + a (T - T_ref)), where T_ref is 0°C, which is 273.15 K. So in that case, if R0 is 9.20 ohms at T_ref, then when R is 12.40, we can compute T.

Let me compute delta R: 12.40 -9.20=3.20 ohms.

So delta R = 3.20 ohms.

So delta R / R0 = 3.20 /9.20 ≈ 0.3478.

Assuming linearity, delta T = delta R / (R0 * a).

So delta T = 0.3478 / a.

If a is 0.00392, then delta T ≈ 88.76 K, as before.

So T = 273.16 +88.76 ≈ 361.92 K.

Hmm, not matching any option.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the inverse method. Maybe the formula is R = R0 + a * (T - T0) * R0.

Wait, that would be R = R0 (1 + a (T - T0)).

Which is the same as before. So maybe I'm not making a mistake there.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the 1968 equation, which includes a quadratic term. Let me think: R = R0 (1 + a (T - T0) + b (T - T0)^2).

But without knowing 'b', I can't compute it. So perhaps the problem expects me to use the linear approximation, assuming a is 0.00392.

Wait, perhaps I should check the options again. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, 12.40 /9.20 = 1.3478. Then 1.3478 -1 = 0.3478.

Divide by 0.00392: 0.3478 /0.00392 ≈ 88.76.

So T=273.16+88.76=361.92 K. Hmm.

Looking at the options, F is 368.1 K, which is about 6 K higher. Maybe I miscalculated something.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses a different alpha. For example, if alpha is 0.003908, then:

0.3478 /0.003908 = let's compute. 0.003908 *89=0.348 approx, so 89. So T=273.16+89=362.16 K. Still not matching.

Wait, maybe the problem uses a different approach. Alternatively, perhaps the question is reversed. Wait, when the resistance is 9.20, it's at 273.16 K. So when resistance increases, temperature increases. So 12.40 is higher, so temperature should be higher than 273.16.

Looking at the options, D is 353.8 K, which is about 80 K higher. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should check another approach. Maybe using the ratio method.

The formula is T = T0 + (R - R0)/(R0 * a).

So T = 273.16 + (12.40-9.20)/(9.20 * 0.00392).

So numerator is 3.20. Denominator is 9.20 *0.00392=0.036144.

3.20 /0.036144 ≈88.55 K.

So T=273.16+88.55=361.71 K.

Still not matching any options.

Wait, maybe the problem is using a different alpha. Let me think. Another possible alpha is about 0.0039 per K. Let me calculate with a=0.0039.

So 0.3478 /0.0039 ≈89.18 K. So T=273.16+89.18≈362.34 K.

Still not matching options.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but that's unlikely because the options are given. Alternatively, maybe I should check the calculation again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial formula. Another possibility is that the formula is R = R0 (1 + a (T - T_ref)), where T_ref is 0°C, but sometimes the formula is written as R = R0 (1 + a (T - T0)), where T0 is the temperature at R0.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula as R = R0 (1 + a (T - T0)), where T0 is 273.16 K.

So, R =9.20*(1+ a (T -273.16)).

At R=12.40, 12.40=9.20*(1+ a (T -273.16)).

Divide both sides by 9.20: 12.40/9.20=1 + a (T-273.16).

12.40/9.20=1.3478.

So, 1.3478-1=0.3478 =a (T-273.16).

So, (T-273.16)=0.3478/a.

If a=0.00392, then T=273.16 + 0.3478/0.00392 ≈ 273.16 +88.76≈361.92 K.

Hmm, same result.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to use a different alpha. Let me check the standard values.

Wait, I found that the Callendar-Van Dommelen equation for platinum is:

R = R0 [ 1 + 0.00390832 (T - 273.15) + 0.0000005772 (T - 273.15)^2 ]

But without the quadratic term, using only the linear part:

R ≈ R0 (1 + 0.00390832 (T - 273.15)).

So using this, let's compute.

12.40 =9.20 * [1 + 0.00390832 (T -273.15)].

Divide both sides by 9.20: 12.40/9.20 ≈1.3478.

So, 1.3478 =1 + 0.00390832 (T -273.15).

Subtract 1: 0.3478 =0.00390832 (T-273.15).

Divide both sides: (0.3478)/(0.00390832) ≈88.98 K.

So, T=273.15 +88.98≈362.13 K.

Still not matching any option.

Wait, the options are A:404.8, B:273.16, C:345.2, D:353.8, E:299.2, F:368.1, G:390.7, H:400.3, I:330.5, J:312.0.

Hmm, the closest is F:368.1, which is about 6 K higher than my calculation. Did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Wait, maybe I should check the calculation again. 0.3478 /0.00390832.

Let me compute this:

0.3478 ÷ 0.00390832.

Well, 0.00390832 × 88 =?

0.00390832 ×80=0.3126656

0.00390832 ×8=0.03126656

Total: 0.3126656 +0.03126656=0.34393216.

So 88 gives 0.34393216, which is less than 0.3478.

The difference is 0.3478 -0.34393216=0.00386784.

Now, 0.00386784 /0.00390832 ≈ approximately 0.99.

So, 88 +0.99≈88.99.

So, delta T is approximately 88.99 K.

So T=273.15 +88.99=362.14 K.

Still not matching any option.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different alpha. Let me try a=0.003908.

Then, 0.3478 /0.003908 ≈88.99 K.

Same result.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different reference temperature. Maybe T0 is 0°C (273.15 K), but the problem says triple-point cell is 273.16 K. Close enough.

Wait, maybe the problem uses a different formula, perhaps R = R0 + a (T - T0) R0.

Which is the same as R = R0 (1 + a (T - T0)).

Same as before.

Hmm. Maybe the problem is using an alpha of 0.00392, giving T=361.92 K. Since none of the options match, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the problem is using the reciprocal. Let me think: maybe the formula is R = R0 (1 + a (T - T0)), but perhaps the problem is using the inverse, like T = T0 + (R - R0)/(R0 a).

Which is the same as before.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the W curve or another method, but without more data, I can't compute that.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the options and see which one, when plugged into the formula, gives R=12.40.

Let me take option D:353.8 K.

Compute R: R=9.20*(1 +0.00390832*(353.8-273.15)).

353.8-273.15=80.65 K.

0.00390832 *80.65≈0.315.

So 1 +0.315=1.315.

9.20 *1.315≈12.098 ohms. Hmm, but the given R is 12.40, so it's lower than that.

So option D would give R≈12.098, which is less than 12.40.

Next, option F:368.1 K.

368.1-273.15=94.95 K.

0.00390832 *94.95≈0.3707.

1 +0.3707=1.3707.

9.20*1.3707≈12.57 ohms. Hmm, that's a bit higher than 12.40.

So 12.57 is higher than 12.40, but closer than D.

Wait, the desired R is 12.40. So let's see:

At T=361.92 K, R≈12.40.

But none of the options match. So perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but that's unlikely.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the alpha value. Let me try a=0.00392.

So for option F, T=368.1 K.

368.1-273.16=94.94 K.

0.00392 *94.94≈0.3717.

1 +0.3717=1.3717.

9.20 *1.3717≈12.57 ohms.

Hmm, still higher than 12.40.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is D:353.8 K.

Let me compute R for D:353.8 K.

353.8-273.16=80.64 K.

0.00392 *80.64≈0.3162.

1+0.3162=1.3162.

9.20 *1.3162≈12.098 ohms. Still lower than 12.40.

Wait, maybe I should try a higher alpha. Let's say alpha=0.0038 per K.

Then, delta T=0.3478/0.0038≈91.526 K.

So T=273.16 +91.526≈364.686 K. Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different approach, like the platinum resistance thermometer tables. I think at 373 K (100°C), the resistance is about 13.2 ohms. Wait, but our R is 12.40, which is lower, so temperature should be lower than 373 K.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but that can't be. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the inverse formula, R = R0 (1 + a (T - T0)), but with T0=0 K, which doesn't make sense. Or maybe T0 is different.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is R = R0 * (1 + a (T - T0)), where T0 is the temperature at R0, which is 273.16 K.

Wait, perhaps I should try to compute using another method. Let me consider the ratio of resistances.

The ratio R/R0 = 12.40/9.20=1.3478.

If I take the logarithm, but I don't think that applies here.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the approximation that R is proportional to T, but that's only true at very low temperatures, which isn't the case here.

Wait, perhaps I should check the options again. Let me compute the R for each option using the formula R =9.20*(1+0.00390832*(T-273.15)).

Option D:353.8 K.

T=353.8: 353.8-273.15=80.65 K.

0.00390832 *80.65≈0.315.

So R=9.20 *1.315≈12.098 ohms. Not 12.40.

Option F:368.1 K.

368.1-273.15=94.95 K.

0.00390832 *94.95≈0.3707.

R=9.20 *1.3707≈12.57 ohms. Hmm, higher than 12.40.

So perhaps the correct temperature is between D and F.

Wait, maybe the correct answer is not listed. But since the options are given, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different alpha, such as 0.00392 per K. Let me try that.

For option D:353.8 K.

353.8-273.16=80.64 K.

0.00392 *80.64≈0.3162.

R=9.20*(1.3162)=12.098. Still lower than 12.40.

For option F:368.1 K.

368.1-273.16=94.94 K.

0.00392 *94.94≈0.3717.

R=9.20 *1.3717≈12.57 ohms.

Hmm, still higher.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but given the options, the closest higher value is F:368.1 K, which gives R≈12.57. But the desired R is 12.40, which is between D and F.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is D:353.8 K, which gives R≈12.098, but that's lower than 12.40. Alternatively, perhaps I should choose the closest option, which would be D:353.8 K, but that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem has a typo, and the correct answer isn't listed, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I should try a different approach. Let me compute the temperature that would give R=12.40 using the formula.

Using R=9.20*(1 +0.00390832*(T-273.15))=12.40.

So 1 +0.00390832*(T-273.15)=12.40/9.20≈1.3478.

So 0.00390832*(T-273.15)=0.3478.

So T-273.15=0.3478/0.00390832≈88.98 K.

So T=273.15+88.98≈362.13 K.

Looking at the options, the closest is F:368.1 K, but that's about 6 K higher. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me try again.

0.3478 divided by 0.00390832.

Let me compute this as 0.3478 ÷ 0.00390832.

0.00390832 *88 = 0.34393216.

0.3478 -0.34393216=0.00386784.

0.00386784 /0.00390832≈0.99 (approximately).

So total delta T=88 +0.99=88.99 K.

So T=273.15 +88.99=362.14 K.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to use a different formula, such as the inverse. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the reciprocal of R.

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Resistance increases with temperature in platinum.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula R = R0 + a (T - T0) * R0, which is the same as R = R0 (1 +a (T-T0)).

So I think I'm correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the 1968 equation, which includes a quadratic term. Let me try that.

The 1968 equation is:

R = R0 [1 + 0.00390832 (T - 273.15) + 0.0000005772 (T - 273.15)^2 ]

So let's compute for T=362.14 K.

(T-273.15)=88.99 K.

Compute 0.00390832 *88.99≈0.3478.

Compute 0.0000005772*(88.99)^2.

88.99^2≈7919.7.

0.0000005772 *7919.7≈0.00457.

So total multiplier: 1 +0.3478 +0.00457≈1.35237.

So R=9.20 *1.35237≈12.44 ohms. Hmm, that's very close to 12.40. So T≈362.14 K.

But the options don't have that. The closest option is F:368.1 K, which would give R≈12.57, as calculated before.

Wait, but with the quadratic term, the R is 12.44 at T=362.14 K. The desired R is 12.40, which is a bit lower. So perhaps the actual T is a bit lower than 362.14 K.

Let me compute for T=362 K.

(T-273.15)=88.85 K.

0.00390832 *88.85≈0.3474.

0.0000005772*(88.85)^2.

88.85^2≈7895.3.

0.0000005772 *7895.3≈0.00456.

Total multiplier:1 +0.3474 +0.00456≈1.35196.

R=9.20*1.35196≈12.43 ohms. Still higher than 12.40.

Wait, perhaps I need to find T where R=12.40.

So,

12.40 =9.20 [1 +0.00390832*(T-273.15) +0.0000005772*(T-273.15)^2 ]

Divide both sides by 9.20:

12.40/9.20≈1.3478 =1 +0.00390832 x +0.0000005772 x^2, where x=T-273.15.

So,

0.00390832 x +0.0000005772 x^2 =0.3478.

This is a quadratic equation: 0.0000005772 x² +0.00390832 x -0.3478=0.

Multiply all terms by 1e6 to eliminate decimals:

0.5772 x² +3908.32 x -347800=0.

Wait, perhaps it's better to use the quadratic formula.

a=0.0000005772.

b=0.00390832.

c= -0.3478.

The quadratic equation is ax² +bx +c=0.

The solution is x = [-b ± sqrt(b² -4ac)]/(2a).

Compute discriminant D= b² -4ac.

b²= (0.00390832)^2≈0.00000001527.

4ac=4 *0.0000005772*(-0.3478)=4 *(-0.0000005772 *0.3478)=4*(-0.0000002007)= -0.0000008028.

So D=0.00000001527 +0.0000008028=0.00000081807.

sqrt(D)=sqrt(0.00000081807)= approximately 0.0009044.

So,

x = [-0.00390832 ±0.0009044]/(2*0.0000005772).

We take the positive root because x is positive (temperature above 273.15).

So,

x = (-0.00390832 +0.0009044)/(2*0.0000005772).

Compute numerator: -0.00390832 +0.0009044= -0.00300392.

Wait, that gives a negative x, which can't be right. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the signs.

Wait, the equation is ax² +bx +c=0, where c is -0.3478.

So,

x = [-b ± sqrt(b² -4ac)]/(2a).

So,

x = [-0.00390832 ± sqrt(0.00000081807)]/(2*0.0000005772).

So,

x = [-0.00390832 ±0.0009044]/(0.0000011544).

Taking the positive root:

x= (-0.00390832 +0.0009044)/0.0000011544 ≈ (-0.00300392)/0.0000011544 ≈ -2598 K. That's impossible.

Taking the other root:

x= (-0.00390832 -0.0009044)/0.0000011544 ≈ (-0.00481272)/0.0000011544 ≈-4166 K. Also impossible.

Wait, that can't be right. I must have made a mistake in calculating the discriminant.

Wait, let me recalculate D.

D= b² -4ac.

b=0.00390832 → b²= (0.00390832)^2=0.00000001527.

a=0.0000005772.

c= -0.3478.

So,

4ac=4 *0.0000005772 * (-0.3478)=4*(-0.0000002007)= -0.0000008028.

So,

D=0.00000001527 - (-0.0000008028)=0.00000081807.

Yes, that's correct.

So sqrt(D)=0.0009044.

So,

x = [-0.00390832 ±0.0009044]/(2*0.0000005772).

Wait, 2a=2*0.0000005772=0.0000011544.

So,

First possibility: x = (-0.00390832 +0.0009044)/0.0000011544.

-0.00390832 +0.0009044= -0.00300392.

Divided by 0.0000011544: x≈-2598 K. Impossible.

Second possibility: x= (-0.00390832 -0.0009044)/0.0000011544.

-0.00481272/0.0000011544≈-4166 K. Also impossible.

Wait, that can't be right. So perhaps the quadratic term doesn't significantly affect the result, and the linear approximation holds. So the correct temperature is around 362 K, but that's not listed.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but the closest is D:353.8 K, which gives R≈12.098, which is lower than 12.40. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is F:368.1 K, which gives R≈12.57, which is higher than 12.40.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but given the options, the closest higher option is F:368.1 K.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Maybe the problem uses a different alpha value, perhaps 0.00392 per K.

Wait, let me try that.

Using alpha=0.00392, then:

x= (0.3478)/0.00392≈88.76.

So T=273.16+88.76≈361.92 K.

Again, not matching any option.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is not listed. But the options are given, so perhaps I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the reciprocal formula. Let me think: R = R0 (1 + a (T - T0)).

Wait, perhaps I should compute the temperature for each option and see which one gives R=12.40.

Option D:353.8 K.

Using alpha=0.00390832.

R=9.20*(1 +0.00390832*(353.8-273.15)).

353.8-273.15=80.65 K.

0.00390832 *80.65≈0.315.

So R=9.20*1.315≈12.098 ohms.

Not 12.40.

Option F:368.1 K.

368.1-273.15=94.95 K.

0.00390832 *94.95≈0.3707.

R=9.20 *1.3707≈12.57 ohms.

Hmm.

Option G:390.7 K.

390.7-273.15=117.55 K.

0.00390832 *117.55≈0.458.

R=9.20*(1.458)=13.38 ohms. Higher than 12.40.

Option H:400.3 K.

400.3-273.15=127.15 K.

0.00390832 *127.15≈0.496.

R=9.20 *1.496≈13.77 ohms.

Too high.

Option I:330.5 K.

330.5-273.15=57.35 K.

0.00390832 *57.35≈0.223.

R=9.20 *1.223≈11.24 ohms. Lower than 12.40.

Option J:312.0 K.

312.0-273.15=38.85 K.

0.00390832 *38.85≈0.1516.

R=9.20 *1.1516≈10.56 ohms. Lower.

Option C:345.2 K.

345.2-273.15=72.05 K.

0.00390832*72.05≈0.281.

R=9.20 *1.281≈11.8 ohms. Still lower.

Option E:299.2 K.

299.2-273.15=26.05 K.

0.00390832 *26.05≈0.1017.

R=9.20 *1.1017≈10.11 ohms. Lower.

Option A:404.8 K.

404.8-273.15=131.65 K.

0.00390832 *131.65≈0.514.

R=9.20*1.514≈13.93 ohms. Way higher.

So the only option that gives R close to 12.40 is F:368.1 K, which gives R≈12.57, and D:353.8 K, which gives R≈12.098.

Since 12.40 is between these two, perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but among the options, the closest is D:353.8 K.

Wait, but 12.40 is closer to 12.57 (F) than to 12.098 (D). The difference between 12.40 and 12.098 is 0.302, while between 12.40 and 12.57 is 0.17. So perhaps the correct answer is F:368.1 K.

But according to my calculations, the correct temperature is around 362 K, which isn't listed. So perhaps the intended answer is D:353.8 K, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation, and the correct answer is D:353.8 K.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different alpha value. Let me try alpha=0.0038 per K.

Then, delta T=0.3478/0.0038≈91.526 K.

So T=273.16+91.526≈364.686 K.

Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the inverse of the formula, such as T = T0 + (R/R0 -1)/alpha.

Which is what I did earlier.

Hmm.

After all this, I think the correct answer is not listed, but given the options, the closest higher value is F:368.1 K. However, I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D:353.8 K, but that gives a lower R.

Wait, perhaps I should check the problem again. The problem states that the resistance is 9.20 ohms in the triple-point cell, which is 273.16 K. When the resistance becomes 12.40 ohms, what temperature does it show?

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula R = R0 (1 + a (T - T_ref)), where T_ref is 0°C (273.15 K), and a is 0.00392 per K.

Let me compute T for R=12.40.

delta R/R0= (12.40-9.20)/9.20=3.20/9.20≈0.3478.

delta T=0.3478/0.00392≈88.76 K.

So T=273.16+88.76≈361.92 K.

Still not matching any option.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is D:353.8 K, which would give R≈12.098, but that's lower than 12.40. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is F:368.1 K, which is 6 K higher, giving R≈12.57.

Since the problem expects me to choose from the options, and my calculation gives around 362 K, but the options don't have that, perhaps the intended answer is D:353.8 K.

But I'm not sure. Another possibility is that the problem uses a different alpha, such as 0.003908 per K, leading to T=362.14 K, which is still not listed.

Given the options, I'll have to choose the closest one, which is F:368.1 K, but I'm not fully confident.
</think>

The problem involves determining the temperature corresponding to a resistance of 12.40 ohms for a platinum-resistance thermometer, given that its resistance is 9.20 ohms at the triple-point cell temperature of 273.16 K. The relationship between resistance and temperature for platinum thermometers is typically expressed as:

\[
R = R_0 (1 + \alpha (T - T_0))
\]

where \( R_0 = 9.20 \, \Omega \), \( T_0 = 273.16 \, \text{K} \), and \( \alpha \) is the temperature coefficient of resistance. Using the linear approximation with \( \alpha \approx 0.00390832 \, \text{K}^{-1} \), the temperature \( T \) is calculated as:

\[
T = T_0 + \frac{R - R_0}{R_0 \cdot \alpha}
\]

Substituting \( R = 12.40 \, \Omega \), \( R_0 = 9.20 \, \Omega \), and \( \alpha = 0.00390832 \, \text{K}^{-1} \):

\[
T = 273.16 + \frac{12.40 - 9.20}{9.20 \cdot 0.00390832} \approx 273.16 + 88.98 \approx 362.14 \, \text{K}
\]

This calculated temperature of approximately \( 362.14 \, \text{K} \) does not match any of the provided options. To identify the closest match, the resistance corresponding to each option was calculated using the formula \( R = R_0 (1 + \alpha (T - T_0)) \). The results are as follows:

- **Option D (353.8 K):** \( R \approx 12.098 \, \Omega \) (lower than 12.40)
- **Option F (368.1 K):** \( R \approx 12.57 \, \Omega \) (higher than 12.40)

Since \( 12.40 \, \Omega \) lies between these two values, the closest higher match is **Option F (368.1 K)**. Although the exact match is not listed, this is the most reasonable choice based on the given options.

**Answer: F**
