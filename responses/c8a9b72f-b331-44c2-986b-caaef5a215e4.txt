Question:

It has been estimated that each square meter of the earth's surface supports 1 × 10^7 g of air above it. If air is 20% oxygen (O_2, molecular weight = 32 g/mole) by weight, approximately how many moles of O_2 are there above each square meter of the earth?

Options:

A: 8 × 10^4 moles
B: 7 × 10^5 moles
C: 1 × 10^5 moles
D: 2.5 × 10^4 moles
E: 2 × 10^6 moles
F: 3 × 10^4 moles
G: 5 × 10^3 moles
H: 6 × 10^4 moles
I: 1.5 × 10^5 moles
J: 4 × 10^4 moles

Okay, so I have this problem here about figuring out how many moles of O₂ are above each square meter of the Earth. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these calculations, but I'll give it a shot.

First, the problem says that each square meter supports 1 × 10^7 grams of air. Right, so that's the total mass of air above one square meter. Then, it mentions that air is 20% oxygen by weight. So, I think I need to find out how much of that 1e7 grams is oxygen and then convert that mass into moles.

Wait, oxygen here is O₂, and its molecular weight is given as 32 grams per mole. Okay, that's important because I'll need that to convert grams to moles.

Alright, let me outline the steps:

1. Find the mass of oxygen in the air above one square meter.
2. Convert that mass into moles using the molecular weight of O₂.

Starting with step one: the total mass of air is 1e7 grams. Since 20% is oxygen, I can calculate 20% of 1e7 grams. So, 20% is the same as 0.2 in decimal. Multiplying that by 1e7 grams gives me the mass of O₂.

Let me do that calculation: 0.2 * 1e7 = 2e6 grams. So, there are 2,000,000 grams of O₂ above each square meter.

Now, onto step two: converting grams to moles. The molecular weight of O₂ is 32 g/mol. So, I divide the mass of O₂ by the molecular weight to get moles.

So, 2e6 grams / 32 grams per mole. Let me compute that. 2,000,000 divided by 32. Hmm, let's see: 32 goes into 2000 six times because 32*62=1984. Wait, perhaps a better way is to simplify the division.

Alternatively, 2e6 divided by 3.2e1 (since 32 is 3.2e1). Let me write it as exponents: 2e6 / 3.2e1 = (2/3.2) * 1e(6-1) = (0.625) * 1e5 = 6.25e4 moles. Wait, 6.25 × 10^4 moles.

Looking at the options, let's check which one matches. The options are A:8e4, B:7e5, C:1e5, D:2.5e4, E:2e6, F:3e4, G:5e3, H:6e4, I:1.5e5, J:4e4.

Hmm, 6.25e4 is close to option H, which is 6e4. But wait, maybe I should double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

Wait another thought: 32 grams per mole is for O₂. So, each mole is 32 grams. So 2e6 grams divided by 32 grams per mole is indeed 62,500 moles, which is 6.25e4. So that's 6.25 × 10^4, which is approx 6e4 when considering significant figures, perhaps. But let me see the options more carefully.

Looking at the options, H is 6 × 10^4, which is 60,000. That's pretty close to my calculation. Alternatively, maybe I should check if I did the percentage correctly.

Wait, 20% is O₂, so 0.2 times total mass. Yes, that's correct. So I think my calculation is right.

Wait, but wait a second—could there be a miscalculation in the division? Let me do 2e6 /32 again.

2,000,000 divided by 32. Let me compute it step by step.

32 × 60,000 = 1,920,000. Because 32 × 60,000 is 32 * 6e4 = 1.92e6. So 60,000 moles would be 1.92e6 grams. But we have 2e6 grams, which is 80,000 grams more. So, 80,000 /32 = 2,500. So 60,000 +2,500 = 62,500, which is 6.25e4. So that's 62,500 moles.

Looking back at the options, H is 6e4, which is 60,000. The next higher option is I, which is 1.5e5, but that's way higher. So 6.25e4 isn't one of the options exactly, but H is 6e4, which is the closest. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the problem's data.

Wait, the problem says each square meter supports 1e7 grams of air, which is 10,000,000 grams. 20% of that is 2,000,000 grams of O₂. Molecular weight of O₂ is 32 g/mol, so 2e6 / 32 = 62,500 mol. So that's 6.25e4.

Looking again at the options, I see option H is 6e4, which is 6 × 10^4. So that would be 60,000. So 62,500 is closer to 6e4 than to 7e4, which is option B. So the answer must be H:6e4.

Wait, but wait another thing: perhaps the problem is using a different approach. Let me think if I missed any steps.

Wait, the question is about the number of moles of O₂, which I think I correctly calculated. 20% of the air is O₂, and then converted to moles. Yeah, I think that's right.

So the correct answer should be H:6 × 10^4 moles.
</think>

To determine the number of moles of O₂ above each square meter, we start by calculating the mass of O₂. Given that each square meter supports 1 × 10^7 g of air and air is 20% oxygen, the mass of O₂ is 0.2 × 1 × 10^7 = 2 × 10^6 g. Using the molecular weight of O₂ (32 g/mol), we convert this mass to moles: 2 × 10^6 g ÷ 32 g/mol = 6.25 × 10^4 moles. Among the options, the closest value is H: 6 × 10^4 moles.

Answer: H
