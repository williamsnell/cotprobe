Okay, so I've got this question about the capacitance of a cable when its length is doubled. Hmm, I remember that capacitance has something to do with the ability to store electrical energy, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact details when it comes to how length affects it.

Wait, I think capacitance in a cable depends on the formula for a capacitor. The formula for capacitance is C = ε₀ * εᵣ * A / d, right? Where ε₀ is the vacuum permittivity, εᵣ is the relative permittivity of the material between the plates, A is the area of the plates, and d is the distance between them. But wait, that's for a parallel plate capacitor. How does that apply to a cable or a transmission line?

Oh, right, in the case of a cable, like a coaxial cable, the capacitance formula is a bit different. The formula for capacitance in a coaxial cable is C = (ε₀ * εᵣ * L) / ln(b/a), where L is the length of the cable, and a and b are the radii of the inner and outer conductors, respectively. So the capacitance is proportional to the length L.

Wait, so if the length L doubles, then the capacitance C would also double, because C is directly proportional to L. So if you double the length, the capacitance doubles. That makes sense because capacitance depends on the geometry of the cable, and increasing the length would mean more area for the electric field to act upon, thus increasing the capacity to store charge.

Let me think again. So the original formula is C = (some constants) multiplied by L. So if L becomes 2L, then C becomes 2C. So the capacitance would double. So the correct answer should be that the capacitance is doubled.

Looking at the options: Option D is "doubled." So yeah, that's the right choice.

The capacitance of a cable, particularly a coaxial cable, is directly proportional to its length. When the length is doubled, the capacitance also doubles. 

Answer: D
