Okay, so I need to find the shortest path from node 1 to node 14 in this undirected graph. The edges are given as E = {<0,1>, <1,3>, <0,3>, <3,4>, <0,4>, <1,2>, <2,5>, <2,7>, <2,6>, <6,7>, <6,10>, <5,8>, <10,9>, <5,10>, <6,8>, <7,8>, <6,9>, <7,10>, <8,10>, <9,11>, <9,12>, <9,13>, <13,12>, <13,11>, <11,14>}.

Hmm, first, I should probably sketch the graph or at least visualize the connections to get a better idea. Let's list out the nodes and their connections.

Starting from node 1:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0 and 3 and 2.

Let's see each node's neighbors:

- Node 0: connected to 1, 3, 4.
- Node 1: connected to 0, 3, 2.
- Node 2: connected to 1, 5, 7, 6.
- Node 3: connected to 1, 0, 4.
- Node 4: connected to 0, 3.
- Node 5: connected to 2, 8, 10.
- Node 6: connected to 2, 7, 8, 9, 10.
- Node 7: connected to 2, 6, 8, 10.
- Node 8: connected to 5, 6, 7, 10.
- Node 9: connected to 6, 10, 11, 12, 13.
- Node 10: connected to 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
- Node 11: connected to 9, 13, 14.
- Node 12: connected to 9, 13.
- Node 13: connected to 9, 12, 11.
- Node 14: connected to 11.

Wait, node 14 is only connected to node 11. So to reach 14, the path must end at 11, then go to 14.

So the problem is to get from 1 to 11 first, then to 14.

Looking at the options, let's see which paths reach 11 first and then go to 14.

Looking at option A: [1,2,7,8,10,9,11,14]. That's a possible path.

Option B: [1,2,5,10,6,9,11,14]. Also possible.

Option C: [1,3,0,4,2,6,9,11,14]. That's longer.

Option D: [1,2,5,8,10,14]. Wait, but 10 is connected to 9, which is connected to 11, then 14. So D's path ends at 10, but 10 isn't connected to 14. So D is incorrect.

Option E: [1,2,7,6,8,10,9,11,14]. That's a longer path but valid.

Option F: [1,3,4,0,2,5,8,10,9,11,14]. That's even longer.

Option G: [1,0,3,2,5,8,9,11,14]. That seems shorter than F but let's check if it's possible.

Option H: [1,3,4,0,2,6,9,11,14]. Also possible.

Option I: [1,0,4,3,2,7,10,9,11,14]. That's longer.

Option J: [1,2,6,9,11,14]. That's a possible path.

Wait, J's path is 1-2-6-9-11-14. Let me check if each step is connected.

1 connected to 2: yes.

2 connected to 6: yes.

6 connected to 9: yes.

9 connected to 11: yes.

11 connected to 14: yes.

So J's path is valid and has 5 steps. Let's compare.

Looking back, the edges are undirected, so any path can go either way.

Now, I need to find the shortest path. So let's count the number of steps in each option.

Option A: 7 steps (from 1 to 14 via 7 nodes in between).

Option B: 7 steps.

Option J: 5 steps (1-2-6-9-11-14). That's shorter.

Wait, but is J's path correct? Let's see:

1 connected to 2: yes.

2 connected to 6: yes.

6 connected to 9: yes.

9 connected to 11: yes.

11 connected to 14: yes.

That's correct. So J's path is 5 steps, which is shorter than the others.

Wait, but looking at the options, are there any options with fewer steps than J? Let me check the other options.

Option D was [1,2,5,8,10,14], but 10 isn't connected to 14. So D is invalid.

Option B: [1,2,5,10,6,9,11,14]. That's 7 steps. So J's path is shorter.

Wait, but how many edges are in J's path? From 1 to 2 (1), 2 to 6 (2), 6 to 9 (3), 9 to 11 (4), 11 to 14 (5). So 5 edges, meaning 6 nodes, but the path list has 6 elements (1-2-6-9-11-14). So it's correct.

Is there a path with fewer steps? Let me think.

Another possible path: 1-2-5-8-6-9-11-14. But that's longer.

Alternatively, 1-2-7-6-9-11-14: that's 6 steps, which is longer than J's 5.

Wait, J's path is the shortest so far. Let me check other options.

Option E: [1,2,7,6,8,10,9,11,14] has 8 steps.

So J's path is the shortest. So the answer should be J.

The shortest path from node 1 to node 14 is [1, 2, 6, 9, 11, 14], which has 5 edges and is the shortest among the given options.
