Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about world leaders who were assassinated, and I need to figure out the correct answer. The options are from A to J, each with a different leader. Let me go through each one by one and see which one fits.

Starting with option A: Ferdinand Marcos. I remember that Marcos was the Philippine president, and I think he was more known for the Marcos regime and the declaration of martial law. But was he assassinated? I'm not sure. I think he died in exile in Hawaii, maybe of natural causes. So probably not A.

Option B: Neville Chamberlain. He was the British Prime Minister during the late 1930s, famous for his appeasement policies towards Hitler. I don't recall him being assassinated. He died in 1940, but I think it was from natural causes, maybe cancer. So B is likely not the answer.

Option C: Margaret Thatcher. She was the UK's first female Prime Minister. I remember she was a significant figure, but I don't think she was assassinated. She died in 2013, probably from a stroke or something. So C is out.

Option D: Lee Kuan Yew. He was the founding father of Singapore, Prime Minister for many years. I think he passed away in 2015 from complications related to diabetes. No assassination there, so D is not the answer.

Option E: Winston Churchill. He was a British Prime Minister during WWII. He was a very famous leader, and I don't think he was assassinated. He died in 1965, and I believe it was from a stroke. So E is not it.

Option F: Fidel Castro. He was the Cuban leader for decades. I remember hearing that he died in 2016, but I'm not sure about the circumstances. Wait, wasn't he a target of several assassination attempts by the CIA, but did he actually get assassinated? I think he died of natural causes, like a heart attack. So F might not be the answer.

Option G: Golda Meir. She was the Prime Minister of Israel. I think she was assassinated. Wait, no, I recall she died of cancer in 1978. So G is not the correct choice.

Option H: Muammar Gaddafi. He was the Libyan leader, and I think he was captured and killed during the Libyan civil war in 2011. But was it an assassination or just killed in combat? I think it was more like a capture and then execution by rebels. So maybe H isn't the right answer because it wasn't a targeted assassination by someone else, but rather killed in conflict.

Option I: Indira Gandhi. She was the Prime Minister of India. I definitely remember that she was assassinated. She was shot by her Sikh bodyguards in 1984. That's a clear case of assassination, so I think I is the correct answer.

Option J: Nelson Mandela. He was a South African leader, former president, and Nobel Peace laureate. He died in 2013 of natural causes, specifically from a lung infection. So J is not the answer.

So going through each option, the only one who was assassinated is Indira Gandhi, option I.

The correct answer is I: Indira Gandhi, as she was assassinated in 1984.
