Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about neuroticism and its effects later in life. I'm a bit rusty on my psychology, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I need to understand what neuroticism is. From what I remember, neuroticism is one of the big five personality traits. It's related to a person's susceptibility to negative emotions like anxiety, depression, and stress. High neuroticism means someone is more likely to experience these emotions more frequently and intensely.

The question is asking what an increase in neuroticism later in life strongly predicts. So, the options are A to J. Let's go through them one by one.

Option A: Decreased stress levels. Wait, that doesn't make sense. If someone becomes more neurotic, they're probably more stressed, not less. So A is probably not the right answer.

Option B: Increased social activity. I'm not too sure, but I think neuroticism might actually lead to less social activity because being more anxious or stressed could make someone less likely to engage socially. So B might not be right.

Option C: Mortality. Hmm, I've heard that some studies link high levels of neuroticism to poorer health outcomes. Maybe higher neuroticism could lead to increased mortality? That's a possibility.

Option D: Independence. I'm not sure about this one. Does neuroticism make someone more or less independent? Maybe it's the other way around because high neuroticism might lead to more dependency due to anxiety or depression. So D might not be the answer.

Option E: Increase in creativity. I'm not sure about the link here. Some theories suggest that higher emotional states can fuel creativity, but I'm not certain if neuroticism specifically leads to increased creativity. It's possible, but I'm not confident.

Option F: Cognitive decline. I think there's some research suggesting that higher neuroticism might be associated with cognitive decline in older age. Stress and anxiety can affect brain health, so maybe F is a strong contender.

Option G: Better decision making skills. That seems unlikely. High neuroticism is linked with negative emotions, which can impair decision-making. So G probably isn't correct.

Option H: Loss of social support. If someone becomes more neurotic, maybe they push people away, leading to less social support. That could be a possibility, but I'm not certain if it's the strongest predictor compared to other options.

Option I: Improved memory. No, that doesn't make sense. Stress and anxiety can actually impair memory, so I would think memory gets worse, not better. So I is probably wrong.

Option J: Physical strength. That seems unrelated. High neuroticism might affect mental health, but physical strength? I don't think so. So J is out.

Now, considering all the options, the strongest contenders seem to be C (Mortality) and F (Cognitive decline). I've read before that neuroticism is associated with various health issues. For example, people who are more neurotic might engage in unhealthy behaviors, have weaker immune systems, or have higher levels of chronic stress, all of which can contribute to earlier mortality.

But wait, cognitive decline is also a possibility. High neuroticism could lead to more stress, which is known to affect cognitive functions like memory and decision-making. So maybe F is correct.

But I'm a bit torn. I think the answer is either C or F. Let me think about the context of the question. It says "later in life," so cognitive decline in older age is a common concern. Studies have shown that higher neuroticism in older adults is linked to cognitive decline. So maybe F is the right answer.

Alternatively, mortality might be more directly linked. Some studies have found that higher neuroticism is associated with increased risk of death, possibly due to cardiovascular issues or other stress-related illnesses.

But I'm not entirely certain. I think I'll go with F: Cognitive decline because the question seems to focus on mental health outcomes rather than overall mortality, but I'm not 100% sure.

The question asks what an increase in neuroticism later in life strongly predicts. Neuroticism is a personality trait associated with susceptibility to negative emotions like anxiety and stress. After analyzing the options:

- **A, B, D, E, G, H, I, J**: These options are unlikely because neuroticism typically correlates with negative emotional states and impaired mental health, not decreased stress, increased social activity, independence, creativity, better decision-making, improved memory, or physical strength.

- **C (Mortality)**: Some studies link high neuroticism to poorer health outcomes, potentially increasing mortality risk.

- **F (Cognitive decline)**: Research suggests that higher neuroticism in older adults is associated with cognitive decline due to stress and anxiety affecting brain health.

While both C and F are plausible, the focus on mental health outcomes in the question makes **F: Cognitive decline** the most likely answer.

Answer: F
