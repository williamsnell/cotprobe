Question:

As punishment for bad behavior during recess, Mrs. Busywork asked her class to multiply 10 by $\frac{1}{3}$ five times. John, however, notices that it is possible to multiply 10 by a single fraction and still get the same answer as the other students. What is this single fraction?

Options:

A: \frac{1}{243}
B: \frac{1}{2}
C: \frac{1}{729}
D: \frac{1}{100}
E: \frac{1}{3}
F: \frac{1}{27}
G: \frac{1}{68}
H: \frac{1}{64}
I: \frac{1}{125}
J: \frac{1}{81}

Okay, so I need to figure out this problem where Mrs. Busywork asked her class to multiply 10 by 1/3 five times. John noticed he could just multiply by a single fraction and get the same answer. I need to find what that single fraction is.

First, let me understand what's happening. Multiplying by 1/3 five times is the same as multiplying 10 by (1/3) five times in a row. So, that's 10 * (1/3) * (1/3) * (1/3) * (1/3) * (1/3). Wait, how does that work?

I remember that when you multiply fractions together, you can combine them by multiplying the numerators and denominators. So, (1/3) multiplied by itself five times would be (1^5)/(3^5). Let me calculate that.

1^5 is just 1, right? And 3^5 is 3*3*3*3*3. Let's compute that step by step. 3*3 is 9, then 9*3 is 27, 27*3 is 81, and 81*3 is 243. So, 3^5 is 243. So, (1/3)^5 is 1/243.

So, the class is doing 10 multiplied by 1/243. That would be 10*(1/243) = 10/243.

Now, John found a single fraction that, when multiplied by 10, gives the same result. So, we're looking for a fraction x such that 10 * x = 10/243.

To find x, I can set up the equation 10 * x = 10/243. To solve for x, I divide both sides by 10. So, x = (10/243) / 10. Dividing by 10 is the same as multiplying by 1/10, so x = (10/243) * (1/10) = (10*1)/(243*10) = 10/2430.

Simplifying 10/2430, both numerator and denominator are divisible by 10. So, 10 รท10=1 and 2430 รท10=243. So, x=1/243.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is 1/243. So, that's the fraction John would use.

Let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. The original problem is multiplying by 1/3 five times, which is (1/3)^5 =1/243. So, 10*(1/243) is indeed the same as 10 multiplied five times by 1/3. So, John's single fraction is 1/243, which is option A.

I don't think I made any errors here. The steps seem straightforward: exponentiation of the fraction, simplifying, and solving for x. So, yeah, the answer should be A.

The correct answer is A: \frac{1}{243}.
