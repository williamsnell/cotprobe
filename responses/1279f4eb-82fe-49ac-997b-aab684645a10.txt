Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about developmental models of intelligence. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question is asking which construct is NOT pertinent to developmental models on intelligence. The options are A to J. I remember that developmental models are theories that explain how intelligence develops over time. They typically focus on how intelligence changes as people age, the factors that influence it, and the components that make up intelligence.

Let me go through each option one by one.

A: Triarchic theory of intelligence. I think this is by Robert Sternberg. The triarchic theory breaks down intelligence into three parts: analytical, creative, and practical. It's more about the types of intelligence rather than the developmental aspects, but I'm not sure if it's considered a developmental model. Maybe it's more of a structure of intelligence.

B: Multiple intelligences theory. Howard Gardner's theory here. He proposed that there are multiple types of intelligence, like linguistic, logical-mathematical, etc. This is also about the structure of intelligence, categorizing different types, but not necessarily about how intelligence develops over time. So maybe not a developmental model.

C: Cognitive development theory. This sounds like Jean Piaget's theory. He focused on how children develop cognitive abilities through stages. Definitely a developmental model because it's all about how intelligence and thinking develop at different ages.

D: The positive manifold. I'm not exactly sure about this one. The term "positive manifold" refers to the positive correlations between various cognitive tests, suggesting a general intelligence factor (g). This is more related to psychometric theories, like the idea of g theory. I'm not sure if it's part of a developmental model. It might be a concept used in understanding the structure of intelligence but not necessarily how it develops.

E: G theory. This is Charles Spearman's theory, where 'g' stands for general intelligence. It's about the idea that all cognitive abilities are correlated because they share a common underlying factor. This is more about the structure or factors within intelligence, not necessarily the development over time.

F: Emotional intelligence theory. This deals with the ability to recognize and manage emotions. It's about a different aspect of intelligence, not cognitive development in the traditional sense. So perhaps this isn't part of the developmental models focused on cognitive growth.

G: Primary mental ability theory. Raymond Cattell proposed this. He suggested that intelligence consists of eight primary abilities, like verbal comprehension and spatial visualization. This is about the structure of intelligence, categorizing different abilities, not about development over time.

H: Fluid and crystallized intelligence theory. This is by Jean Piaget and later expanded by others. Fluid intelligence is the ability to think logically and solve novel problems, while crystallized intelligence is the accumulation of knowledge and experience. This definitely relates to how intelligence develops as people age, so it's a developmental model.

I: Investment theory. This is by Richard C. Atkinson and David H. Snow. It suggests that intelligence is built through investments in resources and processes, like education and practice. It's about how intelligence can be developed and grown, so it's a developmental model.

J: Information processing theory. This theory looks at how people process information, like memory, attention, and problem-solving. It's about the mechanisms of intelligence and how they develop, so definitely a developmental model.

Now, the question is which one is NOT pertinent to developmental models. Developmental models focus on how intelligence changes and grows over time. So, looking at the options, I need to find the one that doesn't fit into explaining or modeling the development of intelligence.

Option A: Triarchic theory isn't really about development; it's about the structure. Same with B (Multiple Intelligences), G (Primary mental abilities), E (G theory), and D (Positive manifold). These are more about the structure or factors within intelligence rather than development over time.

But wait, the question is about the only construct that's not pertinent. So which one is not part of any developmental model?

Looking again: C is Piaget's theory, which is definitely developmental. H is fluid and crystallized, which is developmental. I is investment theory, which is about growth. J is information processing, which is about mechanisms of intelligence and their development.

So the ones that are not developmental would be A, B, D, E, F, G. But the question is asking for the one that's not pertinent. So which of these is not part of any developmental model.

Wait, the options are to pick the one that's not related. So, which of these theories is not about development?

Emotional intelligence theory (F) is about a different kind of intelligence, not cognitive development, so it's not part of the developmental models focused on cognitive growth. Similarly, Triarchic theory and Multiple Intelligences are about types, not development.

Wait, but the question is about developmental models on intelligence. So which of these constructs is not related to the development aspect.

The positive manifold (D) is more about the structure and the g factor, not about how intelligence develops. So it's not part of a developmental model.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to think again.

The positive manifold is the idea that all cognitive tests are positively correlated, implying a general intelligence factor. This is part of psychometric theory, not specifically about development. So it's not a construct used in developmental models. So the answer would be D?

Wait, but the options also include F: Emotional intelligence theory, which is not about cognitive development either. So why is F not considered a developmental model? Because it's about a different aspect of intelligence.

But the question is about which is NOT pertinent to developmental models on intelligence. So any theory that doesn't focus on how intelligence develops would be the answer.

So among the options, the ones that are not about development would include A, B, D, E, F, G. But the question is asking for the only one, so perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, the options are A-J, and the question is about which construct is not relevant to developmental models. So the correct answer is the one that isn't part of any model explaining intelligence development.

Emotional intelligence (F) isn't part of the cognitive developmental models. The positive manifold (D) is a statistical concept in psychometrics, not a developmental theory. So which one is the correct answer?

Wait, the question is about the only construct that is not pertinent. So perhaps F is the correct answer because it's about a different type of intelligence, not the cognitive development models. Alternatively, the positive manifold (D) is not a theory about development.

I'm a bit stuck here. Let me see the options again.

The question is about developmental models on intelligence. So the models that explain how intelligence develops. Which of these constructs is not part of that.

Triarchic theory (A) is about the structure, not development. Multiple intelligences (B) same. Cognitive development (C) is definitely a developmental model. The positive manifold (D) is more about the structure. G theory (E) is about the general factor. Emotional intelligence (F) is a different type. Primary mental abilities (G) is about structure. Fluid and crystallized (H) is developmental. Investment theory (I) is about growth. Information processing (J) is about mechanisms.

So the constructs that are not about development are A, B, D, E, F, G. But the question is asking for the only one. So perhaps the answer is F because it's about emotional intelligence, which isn't part of the cognitive developmental models.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is D, the positive manifold, because it's a statistical concept used in psychometrics, not a developmental theory.

Wait, the options are looking for the construct that is not part of any developmental model. So the correct answer would be F: Emotional intelligence theory.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. I think the answer is F because it's not about cognitive development but about a different aspect. Alternatively, D could be the answer because it's a statistical model, not a theory of development.

I'm a bit torn, but I think the answer is F: Emotional intelligence theory because it's not part of the models that explain cognitive development.

The question asks which construct is not pertinent to developmental models of intelligence. Developmental models focus on how intelligence changes and grows over time. Let’s analyze the options:

- **A: Triarchic theory of intelligence**  
  This theory by Robert Sternberg categorizes intelligence into analytical, creative, and practical components. It focuses on the structure of intelligence rather than its development.

- **B: Multiple intelligences theory**  
  Howard Gardner proposed this theory, which identifies various types of intelligence (e.g., linguistic, logical-mathematical). It is more about the structure of intelligence than its development.

- **C: Cognitive development theory**  
  Jean Piaget’s theory explains how cognitive abilities develop through stages. This is a clear example of a developmental model.

- **D: The positive manifold**  
  This concept refers to the positive correlations between cognitive tests, suggesting a general intelligence factor (g). It is a statistical construct used in psychometric theory, not a developmental model.

- **E: G theory**  
  Spearman’s g theory focuses on the general factor of intelligence. It is about the structure of intelligence, not its development.

- **F: Emotional intelligence theory**  
  This theory, which focuses on emotional awareness and regulation, is not part of cognitive developmental models.

- **G: Primary mental ability theory**  
  Raymond Cattell proposed this theory, which categorizes intelligence into primary abilities like verbal comprehension. It is about the structure of intelligence, not its development.

- **H: Fluid and crystallized intelligence theory**  
  This theory by Piaget and others explains how intelligence changes over time, making it a developmental model.

- **I: Investment theory**  
  Richard Atkinson and David Snow’s theory suggests that intelligence grows through investments in resources and processes, making it a developmental model.

- **J: Information processing theory**  
  This theory examines the mechanisms of intelligence, such as memory and problem-solving, and how they develop. It is a developmental model.

Among these, **F: Emotional intelligence theory** stands out as it is not focused on cognitive development but rather on a different aspect of intelligence. While **D: The positive manifold** is also not a developmental model, the question specifies identifying the **only construct** that is not pertinent. Therefore, the answer is **F**.

Answer: F
