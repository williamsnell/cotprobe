Question:

The owner of a large family estate decided to sell the property. The owner entered into a valid written brokerage agreement with a real estate broker. According to terms of the agreement, the broker promised to undertake best efforts to sell the estate for a purchase price of not less than $1,250,000. The contract also provided that the broker was to be paid a commission of 5 percent on the gross sale price following the consummation of the sale and transfer of title. The brokerage agreement was effective for a period of two months. One month later, the broker notified the owner that she had found a buyer who wanted to purchase the property for $1,500,000. That same day, the broker handed the owner a real estate sales contract, signed by the buyer, in which the buyer agreed to pay $1,500,000 for the purchase of the estate. The owner investigated the buyer and discovered he had sufficient funds to purchase the estate. However, the owner changed his mind and decided not to sell the property. He told the broker that he would not sign the agreement. In addition, the owner told the broker that he was canceling their brokerage agreement because he was withdrawing the estate from the market. The owner also refused to pay the broker any commission. If the broker now sues the owner for breach of contract, which of the following, if anything, is the broker's proper measure of recovery?

Options:

A: $75,000, or the commission equivalent of 5 percent on the sale of the property for$1,500,000, plus punitive damages for breach of contract.
B: Nothing, because the owner has the right to withdraw the property from the market at any time.
C: $75,000, or the commission equivalent of 5 percent on the sale of the property for$1,500,000, since all conditions precedent to the owner's duty to pay the commission were fulfilled when the broker produced a buyer who was ready, willing and able to perform.
D: The broker can seek recovery for any expenses incurred during the process of finding a buyer.
E: Nothing, because a condition precedent, namely the consummation of the sale and transfer of title, has failed to occur.
F: $75,000, or the commission equivalent of 5 percent on the sale of the property for$1,500,000, since the consummation condition to the owner's duty to pay the commission was excused by the owner's refusal without cause to accept the buyer's offer and perform the land sale contract.
G: Quantum meruit for the reasonable value for services rendered in obtaining a buyer for the property.
H: $75,000, or the commission equivalent of 5 percent on the sale of the property for$1,500,000, since the broker had obtained a buyer who was willing and able to purchase at a price higher than the minimum set in the brokerage agreement.
I: $62,500, or the commission equivalent of 5 percent on the original minimum sale price of the property for $1,250,000, since the broker had fulfilled her duty by finding a potential buyer.
J: A court injunction forcing the owner to complete the sale, thus entitling the broker to the full commission.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this real estate law question. Let me read through it carefully.

The situation is that an owner of a large family estate decided to sell and entered a brokerage agreement with a real estate broker. The agreement is written and valid. The broker promised to sell the estate for at least $1,250,000 and would be paid 5% commission on the gross sale price once the sale is consummated and title is transferred. The agreement was effective for two months.

One month later, the broker found a buyer willing to pay $1,500,000. She gave the owner a sales contract signed by the buyer. The owner checked and the buyer had enough funds. But the owner decided not to sell, didn't sign the agreement, told the broker he's canceling the brokerage agreement, and refused to pay commission.

The question is: what can the broker recover if she sues?

Looking at the options, I need to determine the proper measure of recovery.

First, I think about the terms of the brokerage agreement. The broker is supposed to find a buyer who's ready, willing, and able to buy at the price. She did that here. The buyer was ready and had the funds. So the condition for the commission is probably met because the broker fulfilled her part.

But the owner refused to sign the contract and canceled the agreement. So the sale didn't happen because the owner backed out.

In real estate brokerage agreements, typically, the broker is entitled to a commission if they find a buyer who is ready, willing, and able, even if the sale doesn't go through because the seller refuses. The reason is that the condition for payment (obtaining such a buyer) was fulfilled.

However, some agreements might tie the commission to the sale actually closing. Here, the agreement says the commission is due upon consummation. So if the sale doesn't happen because the owner refuses, does that mean the commission is owed or not?

I recall that in some cases, even if the sale doesn't go through due to the seller's actions, the broker can still recover the commission because they've substantially performed by finding a buyer. This is sometimes referred to as "earnest performance."

Looking at the options:

Option C says the broker can recover 5% of $1.5M, which is $75k, because the conditions (finding a buyer) were met. It mentions that all conditions precedent were fulfilled when the broker produced the buyer. So this seems to align with the idea that once the buyer is found, the owner's duty to pay arises.

Option E says nothing because the sale didn't consummate. But that depends on whether the condition is deemed to have been fulfilled when the buyer was found. Some courts hold that the condition is met once the buyer is ready and able, even if the sale doesn't happen because the seller refuses.

Option F suggests the commission is owed because the consummation condition is excused by the owner's refusal. So the argument here is that the owner didn't fulfill their part, so the condition for commission payment (sale happening) is excused, and the commission is still owed because the broker did their part.

Option C and F both argue for $75k, but they base it on different reasoning. C says all conditions were met when the buyer was produced, while F says the condition was excused because the owner refused without cause.

I think the key is whether the condition for payment is that the sale must close, or whether the condition is that the broker finds a buyer. In many cases, the broker's obligation is fulfilled by producing a buyer, and the seller's obligation to pay arises from that. So even if the sale doesn't close because the seller backs out, the commission is owed.

Therefore, option C seems correct because it states that all conditions precedent were fulfilled when the broker produced the buyer. The owner's refusal doesn't negate the broker's right to the commission once the buyer was found and the conditions were met.

Other options: Option E argues that because the sale didn't happen, nothing is owed. But that's not the case if the conditions are met by the broker's efforts. Option F is also possible but focuses on the owner's refusal, which might not be the main issue if the condition is already met by the buyer's offer.

So I think the answer is C.

The correct answer is C: $75,000, or the commission equivalent of 5 percent on the sale of the property for $1,500,000, since all conditions precedent to the owner's duty to pay the commission were fulfilled when the broker produced a buyer who was ready, willing and able to perform.

**Answer: C**
