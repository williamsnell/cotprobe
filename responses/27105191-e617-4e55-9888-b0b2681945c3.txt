Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about calculating the work required to charge a capacitor. Hmm, I remember capacitors store electrical energy, right? The question says it's a 10 microfarad capacitor being charged to 100 volts. I need to find out how much work is needed for that.

Wait, work done in charging a capacitor... I think the formula for the energy stored in a capacitor is something like E equals half of capacitance multiplied by voltage squared. So E = ½ C V². Yeah, that sounds right. I've seen that formula before.

Let me plug in the numbers. The capacitance C is 10 microfarads. Oh wait, micro is 10^-6, so that's 10e-6 farads. Voltage V is 100 volts. So substituting, E = 0.5 * 10e-6 * (100)^2.

Let me compute that step by step. First, 100 squared is 10,000. Then multiply by 10e-6. So 10,000 *10e-6 = 0.1. Then multiply by 0.5, so 0.05. So E is 0.05 joules. That should be the energy stored, which is the work done to charge it.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.05 J. So that should be the correct answer. Let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. 10e-6 is 0.00001, multiplied by 10 gives 0.0001, then times 100^2 which is 10,000. Wait, no, wait. Wait, 10e-6 * 10^4 is 10e-6 *10000= 0.1. Oh wait no, 10e-6 is 1e-5, but wait no, 10 microfarads is 10e-6 F. So 10e-6 * 10^4 = 10e-6 *1e4 = 1e-2, which is 0.01. Oh wait, wait, wait. Let me calculate it again properly.

Wait, 100 volts squared is 10^4. So 10e-6 farads times 10^4 volts squared is 10e-6 *1e4 = 10e-2, which is 0.1. Then half of that is 0.05. Yeah, so 0.05 J. So option B is correct.

The work required to charge the capacitor is calculated using the formula \( E = \frac{1}{2} C V^2 \). Substituting \( C = 10 \, \mu F = 10 \times 10^{-6} \, F \) and \( V = 100 \, V \), we get \( E = 0.5 \times 10 \times 10^{-6} \times (100)^2 = 0.05 \, J \). 

Answer: B
