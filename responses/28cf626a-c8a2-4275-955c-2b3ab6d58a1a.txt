Question:

Light from a laser falls on a pair of very narrow slits separated by 0.5 micrometer, and bright fringes separated by 1.0 millimeter are observed on a distant screen. If the frequency of the laser light is doubled, what will be the separation of the bright fringes?

Options:

A: 0.25 mm
B: 0.75 mm
C: 3.0 mm
D: No change in the separation of bright fringes
E: 0.5 mm
F: 2.5 mm
G: 1.25 mm
H: 1.5 mm
I: 1.0 mm
J: 2.0 mm

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the double slit experiment. Hmm, I remember that when light passes through two narrow slits, it creates an interference pattern on a screen. The bright fringes are where the light waves constructively interfere. 

The question says that the slits are separated by 0.5 micrometers. Wait, micrometers are millionths of a meter, right? So that's 0.5 x 10^-6 meters. The bright fringes are 1.0 mm apart, which is 1.0 x 10^-3 meters. 

Now, the frequency of the laser light is doubled. I need to find out what happens to the separation between the bright fringes. The options are A to J, and the answer should be one of them.

I think the formula for the fringe separation (Δy) is given by Δy = (λL)/d, where λ is the wavelength, L is the distance from the slits to the screen, and d is the separation between the slits. Oh wait, I'm not sure about the exact formula. Wait, I think it's Δy = (mλL)/d, but for the first bright fringe, m is 1, so it's λL/d. But wait, the formula for fringe separation is usually Δy = (λ L) / d. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The formula for the position of the m-th bright fringe is y_m = (m λ L) / d. So the separation between two consecutive bright fringes would be the difference between y_{m+1} and y_m, which is ( (m+1)λL/d ) - (m λ L/d ) ) = λ L / d. So the fringe separation is λ L / d. 

But wait, in this problem, they're asking about the separation when the frequency is doubled. So the wavelength λ would change because frequency and wavelength are inversely related (λ = c/f, where c is the speed of light). So if the frequency doubles, the wavelength becomes half.

Wait, so initially, the separation is Δy_initial = λ_initial L / d. After doubling the frequency, the wavelength becomes λ_new = λ_initial / 2. So the new separation Δy_new = (λ_initial / 2) * L / d = (λ_initial L / d ) * (1/2) = Δy_initial / 2.

So if the initial separation was 1.0 mm, then the new separation would be 0.5 mm. Looking at the options, that's option E: 0.5 mm.

Wait, but let me double-check. The formula for fringe spacing is indeed Δy = λ L / d. Because when frequency increases, wavelength decreases. So if frequency doubles, λ halves, so Δy should halve. So the initial spacing is 1.0 mm, so after doubling frequency, it's 0.5 mm. So the answer should be E.

The separation between bright fringes in a double-slit experiment is given by the formula Δy = (λL)/d, where λ is the wavelength of the light, L is the distance to the screen, and d is the slit separation. When the frequency of the laser light is doubled, the wavelength λ is halved because λ = c/f. Therefore, the new fringe separation Δy_new = (λ/2) * L / d = Δy_initial / 2. Since the initial separation is 1.0 mm, the new separation is 0.5 mm.

Answer: E
