Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. The question is about net ionic equations when solutions of NH4Br and AgNO3 are mixed. Hmm, I remember that net ionic equations show the actual reaction that occurs in a solution, excluding the spectator ions. 

First, I'll write down the formulas of the compounds involved. NH4Br is ammonium bromide, so it dissociates into NH4+ and Br- ions. AgNO3 is silver nitrate, which dissociates into Ag+ and NO3- ions. When these two solutions are mixed, the cations and anions can potentially swap partners, forming new compounds.

So, the possible combinations would be NH4+ and NO3- from NH4Br and AgNO3, and Ag+ and Br- from the same. Wait, but when they mix, the cations from each solution (NH4+ and Ag+) could pair with the anions from the other solution (Br- and NO3-). So, the possible products would be NH4NO3 and AgBr.

Now, I need to check if these products are soluble or not. I remember the solubility rules: nitrates are generally soluble, so NH4NO3 would dissolve. What about AgBr? Silver compounds are usually soluble, but wait, bromide with silver—I think AgBr is actually insoluble. Because I remember that most silver halides (like AgCl, AgBr, AgI) are insoluble. So AgBr would precipitate out as a solid.

So the reaction would be the formation of AgBr(s) and NH4NO3(aq). Now, writing the ionic equation: when NH4Br and AgNO3 dissolve, they dissociate completely. So NH4Br → NH4+ + Br-, AgNO3 → Ag+ + NO3-. When mixed, the ions present are NH4+, Br-, Ag+, and NO3-.

The possible double displacement reaction would swap the ions: NH4+ and NO3- form NH4NO3, and Ag+ and Br- form AgBr. But since NH4NO3 is soluble, it stays dissociated, while AgBr precipitates. So the net ionic equation should only include the formation of the precipitate.

Looking at the options, option I is Ag+ (aq) + Br- (aq) → AgBr(s). That makes sense because that's the actual reaction happening. The other ions are spectators here. So the net ionic equation is option I.

The net ionic equation involves the formation of AgBr(s) when NH4Br and AgNO3 are mixed. The correct answer is I.
