Alright, I need to figure out the correct answer to this question. The question is about the case of the former Soviet Union and how it supports Kerr et al.'s (1960) claim. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I should recall what Kerr et al.'s claim was. I think their work was about the relationship between industrial technology and political structures. I remember something about how advanced industrial technology might require certain political structures to function effectively.

The question is asking which option aligns with their claim when looking at the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union was a totalitarian regime, right? So I should focus on options that relate to totalitarian regimes and industrial technology.

Looking at the options:

A: Advanced industrial technology strengthens the power of totalitarian regimes. Hmm, that could make sense because the Soviet Union had significant industrialization under a totalitarian government. Maybe having advanced tech made the regime stronger.

B: Communist societies disperse power between economic classes. I don't think that's right because the USSR was centrally controlled, not dispersed.

C: Democratic governments hinder advanced tech. That seems off because many democracies have advanced tech, so Kerr's point might not support this.

D: Tech has no impact. I don't think so; Kerr probably argued it does have an impact.

E: Totalitarian regimes discourage a ruling elite. Wait, the opposite might be true. Totalitarian regimes usually have a strong ruling elite, like the Communist Party in the USSR.

F: Communist societies are more likely to adopt advanced tech. The USSR did adopt a lot of industrial tech, but I'm not sure if Kerr's claim is specifically about adoption or structure.

G: Totalitarian regimes maintain power with advanced tech. That sounds plausible. The idea is that having advanced industry helps the regime stay in power by providing resources, infrastructure, etc.

H: Democratic governments serve a ruling elite. Maybe, but the question is about the Soviet Union, which was not democratic.

I: Totalitarian regimes are incompatible with advanced tech. That doesn't fit because the USSR was both totalitarian and had advanced tech.

J: Communist societies disperse power between political parties. No, the USSR was a one-party state.

So, considering Kerr's argument, I think they might have argued that advanced industrial technology requires a strong, centralized government to manage it, which fits with totalitarian regimes. So option G says that totalitarian regimes are more likely to maintain power with the help of advanced industrial technology. That makes sense because the Soviet Union used its industrial capabilities to strengthen its control.

Wait, but Kerr's claim was more about how advanced technology necessitates a certain kind of political structure. I think he said that advanced tech can't exist without some form of centralized planning, which totalitarian regimes provide. So the Soviet case supports that idea because they had the tech and a centralized regime.

So the correct answer should be G.
