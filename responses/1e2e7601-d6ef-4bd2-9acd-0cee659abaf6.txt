Okay, so I'm trying to solve this balloon problem. Let me read it again carefully.

We have two balloons at the same temperature, same volume, and same porosity. Both are filled to a pressure of 4 atmospheres. One balloon has 16 kg of oxygen, the other 1 kg of hydrogen. The oxygen balloon leaks down to ½ atmosphere in 1 hour. The question is, how long will it take for the hydrogen balloon to reach ½ atm?

Hmm, I think this has to do with how gases leak. Since both are under the same conditions, maybe the rate of leakage depends on the type of gas. Let me think about gas laws.

I remember that Graham's Law of Effusion says that the rate of effusion is inversely proportional to the square root of the molar mass. So lighter gases effuse faster. But wait, in this case, the balloons are leaking because of their porosity, so maybe it's about how quickly each gas escapes through the pores.

So the rate of pressure loss depends on the molecular weight. Since hydrogen is lighter than oxygen, it should leak faster. But how does that translate into time?

Wait, both balloons start at 4 atm. They leak until they reach ½ atm. So the pressure drops by a factor of 8 (4 to 0.5 is 8 times less). But I'm not sure if that's directly applicable. Maybe I should think in terms of the mass loss over time.

Alternatively, perhaps I should model this as a first-order process. The pressure decreases exponentially with time. The rate constant might be related to the molar mass. Let me think.

The formula for pressure over time in a leaking balloon can be modeled by P(t) = P0 * e^(-kt), where k is the rate constant. But since the mass is involved, maybe k is proportional to the molar mass or inversely proportional.

Wait, if the balloon is losing gas, the rate of mass loss depends on the molar mass and the pressure. Alternatively, the rate of pressure decrease might be faster for lighter gases because they effuse more quickly.

Let me try to set up the equations. The initial pressure is P0 = 4 atm. The final pressure is P = ½ atm.

For the oxygen balloon, it takes 1 hour to go from 4 atm to ½ atm. Let's find out how the pressure changes over time.

Assuming the leak follows a first-order process, the pressure drops as P = P0 * e^(-kt). So for the oxygen balloon:

½ = 4 * e^(-k_o * 1h)
Divide both sides by 4: ½ /4 = 1/8 = e^(-k_o * 1h)
Take natural log: ln(1/8) = -k_o * 1h
So ln(1/8) is -ln(8), so k_o = ln(8) per hour.

Wait, ln(8) is about 2.079. So k_o ≈ 2.079 per hour.

Now, for hydrogen, the same process would apply, but with a different k_h because hydrogen effuses faster. Since hydrogen is lighter, its rate constant k_h should be higher than k_o, because it's leaking faster.

Wait, wait. Actually, Graham's Law says that the rate of effusion is inversely proportional to sqrt(M), so rate ∝ 1/sqrt(M). So for the same time, the amount of gas that escapes (and thus the pressure drop) would be proportional to 1/sqrt(M).

But in the exponential model, the rate constant k is related to the effusion rate. Alternatively, maybe the time taken is inversely proportional to the square root of the molar mass, since a lighter gas would take less time to lose the same pressure drop.

Wait, let's think differently. The time taken for the pressure to drop to ½ atm depends on how quickly the gas is leaking. So if hydrogen leaks faster, it'll take less time to reach the same pressure.

So the oxygen takes 1 hour to drop from 4 to ½ atm. Now, what's the ratio of their molar masses?

Molar mass of O2 is about 32 g/mol (since O is 16, so O2 is 32). Molar mass of H2 is about 2 g/mol.

So the molar mass ratio is 32 / 2 = 16. So sqrt(16) is 4. So the rate of effusion of H2 is 4 times that of O2 (since rate is inversely proportional to sqrt(M)).

Wait, but if the rate of effusion is higher for H2, that means it's losing gas faster. So the time taken for H2 to reach the same pressure drop would be shorter.

Wait, but in the exponential model, the time constant is inversely proportional to the rate of change. So if H2 effuses faster, it would reach the desired pressure quicker.

Wait, perhaps the time taken for the pressure to drop by the same factor is inversely proportional to the square root of the molar mass. Because a lighter gas (lower M) would have a higher effusion rate, so same pressure drop in less time.

Alternatively, perhaps the time is inversely proportional to the square root of the molar mass, so t ∝ 1/sqrt(M).

So for O2, time is t_o = 1 hour, M_o = 32 g/mol.

For H2, M_h = 2 g/mol.

So t_h = t_o * sqrt(M_o / M_h) = 1 hour * sqrt(32/2) = sqrt(16) = 4.

Wait, that gives t_h = 4 hours, which is longer than O2, which doesn't make sense because H2 should leak faster. So maybe I inverted it.

Wait, perhaps t is inversely proportional to the square root of M. Because if M is smaller, t is smaller.

So t_h = t_o * sqrt(M_o / M_h) = 1 * sqrt(32/2) = sqrt(16) = 4. But that would mean H2 takes 4 hours, which is longer, which contradicts. So perhaps I have the ratio wrong.

Wait, maybe the time taken is inversely proportional to the rate of effusion. Since rate H2 is higher, time would be lower.

Wait, let's approach it differently. The rate of pressure decrease depends on the effusion rate. Since the pressure drop is exponential, the time constant is related to the effusion rate.

The rate of effusion (r) is proportional to (P * A * sqrt(T/(M))) ), where A is area, T temp, M molar mass.

But since the balloons are same volume and same porosity, the area and other factors might be the same. So the rate of effusion would be proportional to P * sqrt(1/M). 

Wait, but in the exponential model, the rate of pressure change is dP/dt = -k P, where k is a constant. So k would be proportional to sqrt(1/M), since effusion rate is higher for lower M.

So for O2, k_o = some constant * sqrt(1/M_o)

For H2, k_h = same constant * sqrt(1/M_h)

So k_h = k_o * sqrt(M_o / M_h)

Because sqrt(1/M_h) = sqrt(M_o/(M_h M_o)) )? Wait, maybe I should compute the ratio.

k_h / k_o = sqrt( (1/M_h) / (1/M_o) ) ) = sqrt(M_o/M_h)

Because M_o is 32, M_h is 2, so sqrt(32/2) = sqrt(16) =4.

So k_h = 4 * k_o.

Now, the pressure drops follow P(t) = P0 e^(-k t)

For O2: ½ =4 e^(-k_o * 1h)

So ½/4 = 1/8 = e^(-k_o)

ln(1/8) = -k_o → k_o = ln(8) ≈ 2.079 per hour.

For H2, same P0 and same P(t), so ½ =4 e^(-k_h t_h)

We can write this as:

½ =4 e^(-4 k_o t_h )

Wait, because k_h =4 k_o. So substituting:

½ =4 e^(-4 k_o t_h )

But from O2, we have ½ =4 e^(-k_o *1h). So:

Divide the two equations:

(½)/(½) = [4 e^(-4 k_o t_h)] / [4 e^(-k_o *1h) ]

Simplify: 1 = e^(-4 k_o t_h + k_o *1h )

Take ln: 0 = -4 k_o t_h + k_o *1h

→ 4 k_o t_h = k_o *1h

Divide both sides by k_o: 4 t_h =1h → t_h =1h /4 = 15 minutes.

Wait, so the hydrogen balloon would take 15 minutes to drop to ½ atm. Looking at the options, option G is 15 min.

So the answer is G:15 min.

The problem involves two balloons, one filled with oxygen (16 kg) and the other with hydrogen (1 kg), both initially at 4 atm and leaking to ½ atm. The goal is to determine how long it takes for the hydrogen balloon to reach ½ atm, given that the oxygen balloon takes 1 hour.

Using the exponential decay model for pressure, \( P(t) = P_0 e^{-kt} \), the rate constant \( k \) is related to the molar mass \( M \) through effusion rates. Hydrogen, being lighter, effuses faster, leading to a higher \( k \) and shorter time to reach ½ atm.

The molar mass ratio is \( \sqrt{M_{\text{O}_2}/M_{\text{H}_2}} = \sqrt{32/2} = 4 \). This means the hydrogen balloon's rate constant \( k_{\text{H}_2} = 4k_{\text{O}_2} \).

Using the exponential decay equation for both balloons:
- For oxygen: \( \frac{1}{2} = 4 e^{-k_{\text{O}_2} \cdot 1} \), solving gives \( k_{\text{O}_2} = \ln(8) \approx 2.079 \, \text{per hour} \).
- For hydrogen: \( \frac{1}{2} = 4 e^{-4k_{\text{O}_2} t_h} \).

Substituting \( k_{\text{O}_2} \) into the hydrogen equation:
\[
\frac{1}{2} = 4 e^{-4 \cdot 2.079 \cdot t_h}
\]
Simplifying:
\[
\ln(1/8) = -4 \cdot 2.079 \cdot t_h \implies t_h = \frac{1}{4} \, \text{hour} = 15 \, \text{minutes}.
\]

Thus, the hydrogen balloon takes 15 minutes to reach ½ atm.
