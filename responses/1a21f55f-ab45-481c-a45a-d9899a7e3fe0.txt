Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully and understanding what's being asked.

Alright, the problem is about a circular platform that's rotating. The platform weighs 500 pounds and has a diameter of 12 feet. So, its radius must be half of that, which is 6 feet. It's initially rotating at 30 revolutions per minute (rpm) on a vertical shaft. Then, a 150-pound man who was sitting on the edge of the platform starts running along the edge with a constant speed of 12 feet per second relative to the disk. He's running in the same direction as the disk is moving. The question is asking for the final angular speed of the disk after the man starts running.

Hmm, okay. So this seems like a conservation of angular momentum problem. Because when the man starts moving, he's applying a torque relative to the center, which should affect the rotation of the platform. Since there are no external torques mentioned, the total angular momentum of the system (platform + man) should remain constant.

Wait, but wait a second. The platform is initially rotating at 30 rpm. Then the man starts running in the same direction. I need to calculate the initial angular momentum and the final angular momentum, then set them equal because angular momentum is conserved.

First, let me note down all the given values:

- Weight of platform (W_p) = 500 lb
- Diameter = 12 ft → Radius (r) = 6 ft
- Initial angular velocity (ω_initial) = 30 rpm
- Weight of man (W_m) = 150 lb
- Man's speed relative to disk (v) = 12 ft/s (same direction as rotation)

I need to find the final angular velocity (ω_final) after the man starts running.

Wait, but wait. The platform's initial rotation is 30 rpm, but when the man starts running, he's adding to the system's angular momentum. But wait, actually, he's part of the system, so his motion affects the total angular momentum.

Wait, but the problem says the man is running at 12 ft/s relative to the disk. So, his speed relative to the ground would be the disk's speed plus his speed relative to the disk, I think. Or maybe not, because the disk is rotating, so his speed relative to the ground is the sum of the disk's tangential speed and his running speed relative to the disk. But I need to be careful here.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of angular momentum. Let's model the platform and the man as two separate objects, each contributing to the total angular momentum.

First, let's convert the initial angular velocity from rpm to rad/s because the answer options are in rad/s.

30 rpm is 30 revolutions per minute. Since one revolution is 2π radians, and there are 60 seconds in a minute, so:

ω_initial = 30 * (2π rad) / 60 s = π rad/s ≈ 3.1416 rad/s.

So, ω_initial ≈ 3.14 rad/s.

Now, the platform's moment of inertia (I_p) is needed. Since it's a solid disk, the moment of inertia is (1/2) m r². But wait, the problem gives the weight of the platform in pounds, not mass. Hmm, so I need to convert pounds to mass in slugs. Because in the English system, mass is in slugs, and weight in pounds.

So, mass of platform, m_p = W_p / g, where g is the acceleration due to gravity, which is 32.174 ft/s².

m_p = 500 lb / 32.174 ft/s² ≈ 15.533 slugs.

Similarly, the man's mass, m_m = 150 lb / 32.174 ≈ 4.661 slugs.

Now, the moment of inertia for the platform: I_p = (1/2) * m_p * r².

r is 6 ft, so r² = 36 ft².

I_p = 0.5 * 15.533 slug * (6 ft)^2 = 0.5 * 15.533 * 36 ≈ 0.5 * 15.533 ≈ 7.7665 * 36 ≈ 280.8 slug·ft².

Wait, but let me double-check that calculation. 15.533 * 36 = approximately 559.188, then multiplied by 0.5 gives 279.594 slug·ft². Let me just keep it as approximately 279.6 slug·ft².

Now, the man is sitting on the edge, so his moment of inertia is I_m = m_m * r². Because for a point mass, I = m r².

I_m = 4.661 slug * (6 ft)^2 = 4.661 * 36 ≈ 167.8 slug·ft².

So, the total initial moment of inertia is I_initial = I_p + I_m ≈ 279.6 + 167.8 ≈ 447.4 slug·ft².

The initial angular momentum (L_initial) is I_initial * ω_initial.

L_initial = 447.4 * 3.1416 ≈ let's calculate that.

But wait, the man starts running, so his moment of inertia changes. Wait no, actually, the man's motion is such that his velocity relative to the platform is 12 ft/s in the same direction as the rotation. So his velocity relative to the ground is the platform's tangential speed plus 12 ft/s.

Wait, but no. Wait, because the platform is rotating, the man's speed relative to the ground is the platform's angular velocity multiplied by the radius plus his running speed relative to the platform.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The man is on the edge of the platform, so his speed relative to the platform is 12 ft/s in the same direction as the platform's rotation. So his speed relative to the ground is the platform's tangential speed plus 12 ft/s.

So, the platform's initial angular velocity is ω_initial = 30 rpm = π rad/s ≈ 3.1416 rad/s.

The initial tangential speed of the platform at the edge is v_platform_initial = ω_initial * r = 3.1416 * 6 ≈ 18.8496 ft/s.

When the man starts running, his speed relative to the platform is 12 ft/s in the same direction, so his speed relative to the ground is v_man = v_platform_initial + 12 ft/s = 18.8496 + 12 = 30.8496 ft/s.

Wait, but that's his speed relative to the ground. But I think I'm overcomplicating it. Alternatively, perhaps I should model the man's angular momentum as he moves.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to model the angular momentum before and after.

Initially, the platform is rotating with some angular velocity ω_initial, and the man is at rest relative to the platform, so his angular velocity is the same as the platform's. So his initial angular velocity is ω_initial.

After he starts running, his angular velocity relative to the platform is the same as before, but his speed relative to the ground is higher. Wait, no, that's not correct. Because he's running in the same direction as the rotation, his angular velocity relative to the ground will be higher than the platform's.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of his angular velocity after starting to run. Let me denote the final angular velocity of the platform as ω_final. Then, the man's speed relative to the platform is 12 ft/s. So his speed relative to the ground is v_man = ω_final * r + 12 ft/s.

Wait, no. Wait, the man is moving at 12 ft/s relative to the platform in the same direction as the platform's rotation. So, his speed relative to the ground is v_man = (ω_final * r) + 12 ft/s.

But wait, the platform's angular velocity after the man starts running is ω_final. So the man's speed relative to the platform is 12 ft/s in the same direction as the platform's rotation, so his speed relative to the ground is (ω_final * r) + 12 ft/s.

But I'm trying to model the system's angular momentum. So the platform's angular velocity is ω_final, and the man's angular velocity is also ω_final, but his speed relative to the ground is higher because he's moving faster.

Wait, but no, perhaps it's better to model the system's angular momentum before and after.

Wait, initially, the system (platform + man) has angular momentum L_initial = I_p * ω_initial + I_m * ω_initial.

Because the man was at rest relative to the platform, so he had the same angular velocity as the platform.

So, L_initial = (I_p + I_m) * ω_initial.

After the man starts running, the platform's angular velocity changes to ω_final. The man's movement affects the system's angular momentum because he's now moving faster relative to the platform.

Wait, but since there are no external torques, the total angular momentum should remain the same. So, L_initial = L_final.

So, L_final = I_p * ω_final + I_m * ω_final + something else? Wait, no, because the man's motion is now such that his velocity relative to the ground is higher. Wait, perhaps I should model his angular momentum after.

Wait, let me think again. Initially, both platform and man are rotating with ω_initial, so their angular velocities are the same. So the total angular momentum is (I_p + I_m) * ω_initial.

After the man starts running, the platform's angular velocity is ω_final. The man's angular velocity relative to the platform is 12 ft/s / r. Because his speed relative to the platform is 12 ft/s tangential, so his angular velocity relative to the platform is v / r = 12 / 6 = 2 rad/s. But since he's running in the same direction as the platform's rotation, his angular velocity relative to the ground is ω_final + 2 rad/s.

Wait, no. Because the platform's angular velocity is ω_final, so the man's speed relative to the platform is 12 ft/s, which is v = r * (ω_man_relative). So ω_man_relative = v / r = 12 / 6 = 2 rad/s. So his angular velocity relative to the ground is ω_final + 2 rad/s.

Wait, but that would mean his angular velocity is higher than the platform's. But that can't be right because if he's running in the same direction, his angular velocity relative to the ground should be higher than the platform's. So, his angular momentum would contribute more.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me think again.

The key is that the man's velocity relative to the platform is 12 ft/s. So, his velocity relative to the ground is platform's tangential speed plus his speed relative to the platform. So, v_man = v_platform + v_relative.

v_platform is ω_final * r, and v_relative is 12 ft/s.

So, v_man = ω_final * r + 12 ft/s.

But his angular velocity relative to the ground is v_man / r = (ω_final * r + 12) / r = ω_final + 12/r.

Since r is 6 ft, 12/6 = 2 rad/s. So, his angular velocity relative to the ground is ω_final + 2 rad/s.

Wait, but that's his angular velocity. So, his angular momentum is I_m * (ω_final + 2), and the platform's angular momentum is I_p * ω_final.

So, the total angular momentum after the man starts running is:

L_final = I_p * ω_final + I_m * (ω_final + 2).

But since angular momentum is conserved, L_initial = L_final.

So,

(I_p + I_m) * ω_initial = I_p * ω_final + I_m * (ω_final + 2).

Expanding the right-hand side:

I_p * ω_final + I_m * ω_final + I_m * 2.

Which is (I_p + I_m) * ω_final + 2 I_m.

So, the equation becomes:

(I_p + I_m) * ω_initial = (I_p + I_m) * ω_final + 2 I_m.

Rearranging terms:

(I_p + I_m) (ω_initial - ω_final) = 2 I_m.

So,

ω_initial - ω_final = (2 I_m) / (I_p + I_m).

So,

ω_final = ω_initial - (2 I_m) / (I_p + I_m).

Hmm, okay.

Now, I need to compute I_p and I_m.

Earlier, I calculated I_p as approximately 279.6 slug·ft², and I_m as 167.8 slug·ft².

So, I_p + I_m ≈ 279.6 + 167.8 ≈ 447.4 slug·ft².

2 I_m ≈ 2 * 167.8 ≈ 335.6 slug·ft².

So,

ω_final = ω_initial - (335.6) / (447.4).

Compute (335.6 / 447.4):

≈ 0.7506.

So,

ω_final ≈ 3.1416 rad/s - 0.7506 rad/s ≈ 2.391 rad/s.

Looking at the options, option B is 2.39 rad/s. So that's the answer.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I should model the system's angular momentum.

Alternatively, considering that the man's running adds angular momentum to the system. Wait, but no, because the system's angular momentum is conserved if there are no external torques. So, when the man starts running, the platform's angular velocity will decrease because the man is effectively adding angular momentum in the same direction, but since he's part of the system, it's a bit more involved.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the change in angular momentum. The man's running causes a redistribution of angular momentum between the platform and himself. So, the platform's angular momentum decreases as the man's increases, but the total remains the same.

Wait, but in my earlier approach, I set up the equation correctly, I think. Let me go through it again.

The initial angular momentum is (I_p + I_m) * ω_initial.

After the man starts running, the platform has angular velocity ω_final, and the man has angular velocity ω_final + 2 rad/s (as calculated earlier).

So, L_final = I_p * ω_final + I_m * (ω_final + 2).

Set L_initial = L_final:

(I_p + I_m) ω_initial = I_p ω_final + I_m ω_final + 2 I_m.

Which simplifies to:

(I_p + I_m) ω_initial = (I_p + I_m) ω_final + 2 I_m.

So, (I_p + I_m)(ω_initial - ω_final) = 2 I_m.

Then,

ω_final = ω_initial - (2 I_m)/(I_p + I_m).

Plugging in the numbers:

I_p ≈ 279.6, I_m ≈ 167.8.

So,

2 I_m = 335.6.

I_p + I_m = 447.4.

335.6 / 447.4 ≈ 0.7506.

So,

ω_final ≈ 3.1416 - 0.7506 ≈ 2.391 rad/s.

Which matches option B: 2.39 rad/s.

So, I think that's correct.
</think>

The problem involves a rotating platform and a man running on its edge, requiring the use of conservation of angular momentum. The initial angular velocity of the platform is converted to radians per second, and the moments of inertia for the platform and the man are calculated. The man's running speed relative to the platform introduces a change in the system's angular momentum distribution. By setting the initial and final angular momenta equal and solving for the final angular velocity, the result is approximately 2.39 rad/s.
