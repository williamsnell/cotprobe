Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the wavelength of the sound emitted by a standard 440 Hz tuning fork. Hmm, I remember that the speed of sound in air is a key factor here. Wait, the speed of sound at room temperature, like around 20°C, is approximately 343 meters per second. But wait, the answer options are in feet, so I need to convert that speed into feet per second.

Let me think, 1 meter is about 3.28084 feet. So multiplying 343 m/s by 3.28084 gives me the speed in feet per second. Let me calculate that roughly. 343 * 3 is 1029, and 0.28084 * 343 is approximately 96.5, so adding those together gives around 1125.5 feet per second. I think that's close enough.

Now, the formula for wavelength is speed divided by frequency. The tuning fork is 440 cycles per second, which is 440 Hz. So I divide 1125.5 ft/s by 440 Hz. Let me do that division. 1125 divided by 440... Let's see, 440 times 2 is 880, subtract that from 1125, which leaves 245. 245 divided by 440 is about 0.556. So adding that to 2 gives approximately 2.556 feet. Wait, but the options are given in approximations. Option G is 2.5 ft (approx.), which seems right. But I'm a bit confused because sometimes the speed of sound is taken as 340 m/s, which would give a slightly lower value. Let me check that again.

At 340 m/s, converting to feet: 340 * 3.28084 ≈ 1114.68 ft/s. Divided by 440 Hz gives 1114.68 / 440 ≈ 2.533 feet, which is about 2.5 ft. So yes, option G is the correct answer.

The wavelength is calculated using the speed of sound (approximately 1125.5 ft/s) divided by the frequency (440 Hz), resulting in about 2.5 feet. 

Answer: G
