Question:

Explain how an unconditional branch instruction is specified in an APL program.

Options:

B: A forward slash (/) followed by a number or a label
C: A left pointing arrow followed by a number or a label
D: An exclamation mark followed by a number or a label
E: A right pointing arrow followed by a number or a label
F: A single colon followed by a number or a label

Okay, so I have this question about APL programming, and I need to figure out the answer. The question is about how an unconditional branch instruction is specified in an APL program. The options are A through J, each with different symbols followed by a number or a label.

First, I should recall what I know about APL. APL is a programming language known for its unique set of symbols and its right-to-left execution order. I remember that control structures in APL often use certain symbols to represent different operations.

Unconditional branches are instructions that transfer control to a different part of the program without any condition. In other words, the program will always jump to the specified label or line number regardless of what's happening.

Now, thinking about the symbols in APL. I know that the right arrow (→) is used for branch operations. I believe it's called the "branch" symbol. So, when you want to make an unconditional branch, you use the right arrow followed by the target label or line number. For example, something like →label or →123 would be an unconditional branch.

Looking at the options:

A: Caret (^) followed by a number or label. I think ^ is used for exponentiation in APL, not branching.

B: Forward slash (/) is used for division or as a function, not branching.

C: Left arrow (←) is the assignment operator, so that's not for branching.

D: Exclamation mark (!) is used for logical NOT, I think.

E: Right arrow (→) seems correct, as I recall it being the branch symbol.

F: Single colon (:) I'm not sure about. Maybe for defining functions or something else.

G: Question mark (?) is used in some contexts, perhaps for I/O or other functions.

H: Backslash (\) is used for enclose or other operations.

I: Percentage sign (%) might be used in some dialects, but I don't think it's standard for branching.

J: Double colon (::) is used for defining classes in some languages, but in APL, it's probably not relevant here.

So, putting it all together, the unconditional branch in APL is specified using the right pointing arrow followed by a number or a label. That would be option E.

The unconditional branch instruction in APL uses the right pointing arrow symbol followed by a number or label.
