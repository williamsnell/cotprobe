Okay, so I've got this question about a congenital disorder that affects leptin secretion. Hmm, I remember that leptin is a hormone involved in regulating energy expenditure and appetite. Let me think about what happens when leptin isn't working properly.

Wait, I think leptin is produced by fat cells and it signals to the brain to control how much you eat and how much energy you burn. If someone doesn't produce enough leptin or their body doesn't respond to it, that could mess up their metabolism.

I remember reading about a condition called leptin deficiency. Oh right, people with leptin deficiency tend to be very hungry and have a high appetite. They also don't burn energy efficiently, which would lead to weight gain. So, they might end up being obese.

But wait, there's another angle. I think in some cases, like with congenital leptin deficiency, the body doesn't produce leptin at all. This can cause the person to eat a lot, leading to obesity. But also, leptin has other functions, like regulating thyroid hormones. So without leptin, maybe the thyroid doesn't work properly, leading to hypothyroidism.

What about growth? Leptin also plays a role in growth and puberty. If leptin is deficient, growth might be stunted because the body isn't getting the right signals to develop normally. So, the person might have abnormal growth.

Looking at the options, let's see. Option C says obesity, abnormal growth, hypothyroidism, hyperinsulinaemia. Wait, hyperinsulinaemia? If you're obese, you might have insulin resistance, but in some cases, like early stages, maybe the body produces more insulin because it's trying to manage high blood sugar. Or wait, in obesity, type 2 diabetes is common, which involves insulin resistance, but hyperinsulinaemia is high insulin levels, which is more like type 1? Hmm, maybe I'm getting that mixed up.

Wait, another thought. Leptin also affects insulin secretion. If leptin is low, the body might produce more insulin because it's not getting the signal to balance it. Or maybe in the case of leptin deficiency, the body doesn't respond to insulin properly, leading to higher insulin levels. Or maybe it's the opposite. I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

Looking at the options again. Option B says obesity, excess energy intake, normal growth, and hypoinsulinaemia. Wait, hypoinsulinaemia would mean low insulin, which doesn't sound right if the person is obese because typically, in obesity, you have insulin resistance, leading to higher insulin levels before diabetes sets in.

Option C has hyperinsulinaemia. If leptin is low, perhaps the body's sensitivity to insulin decreases, leading to higher insulin production to maintain normal blood sugar. Or maybe without leptin, the body doesn't process glucose properly, so insulin levels go up. I'm not sure, but I think that in some cases, leptin helps regulate insulin sensitivity. So if leptin is low, insulin resistance could develop, leading to higher insulin levels to compensate.

Putting it together, the disorder would cause obesity because of increased eating and decreased energy expenditure. Abnormal growth because leptin affects growth hormones. Hypothyroidism because leptin influences thyroid function. And hyperinsulinaemia because the body isn't using insulin efficiently, so it produces more.

So looking back at the options, option C seems to fit: Obesity, abnormal growth, hypothyroidism, hyperinsulinaemia.

The correct answer is C. The disorder causes obesity due to increased energy intake and decreased energy expenditure. Abnormal growth occurs because leptin regulates growth and puberty. Hypothyroidism results from leptin's role in thyroid function. Hyperinsulinaemia is likely due to insulin resistance, as the body produces more insulin to compensate for high blood sugar levels.

Answer: C
