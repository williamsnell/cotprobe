Okay, so I need to figure out the answer to the question about the emblem on Peter Fonda's leather jacket in 'Easy Rider'. Hmm, I remember watching the movie a while back, but I'm not entirely sure about the details. Let me think more carefully.

First, I know that 'Easy Rider' is a classic 1960s film. Peter Fonda plays the character Wyatt, right? He's a biker, so his jacket would have some kind of emblem that's significant. The options given are A through J, so I need to go through them one by one.

Option A is a motorcycle wheel. That seems a bit too generic because many bikers would have something related to their bike, but I don't recall seeing a wheel on his jacket. It's possible, but I'm not certain.

Option B is a peace symbol. The 60s were all about peace, love, and rebellion. I think the main characters in 'Easy Rider' are pretty into the hippie lifestyle, so a peace symbol makes sense. I remember seeing some symbols on their jackets, but I'm not sure if it's the peace sign or something else.

Option C is a star-spangled banner, which is the American flag. The movie does have a lot of imagery about freedom and the American West, but I'm not sure if that's the emblem on the jacket. Maybe, but I'm not certain.

Option D is two white doves. Doves symbolize peace, which ties back to the 60s again. I don't recall seeing doves on the jacket, though. Maybe on another character's gear, but not Peter Fonda's.

Option E is the American flag. Wait, I think I might have mixed up the options. So E is the American flag, and C is the star-spangled banner, which is the same thing. So maybe E is correct? But I'm not sure if it's the peace symbol or the flag.

Option F is a Harley-Davidson logo. Since the characters ride Harleys, maybe they have the logo on their jackets. I think they do have some Harley elements, but I'm not sure if it's the emblem on the back or just a patch somewhere else.

Option G is a bald eagle. That's a common symbol in American culture, but I don't remember seeing that on the jacket. Maybe on a helmet or another part of their gear, but not the back of the jacket.

Option H is a red rose. That seems more like a romantic or individual symbol. I don't think that's it because the movie's themes are more about the journey and freedom.

Option I is a pair of dice. That's actually a symbol I remember seeing. I think that's on the jacket. Wait, wasn't it a pair of dice? Or was it something else? I'm a bit confused now.

Option J is a skull and crossbones. That's a common biker emblem, but I don't recall seeing that on Peter Fonda's jacket. It might be on another character's, but not his.

Wait, I think I'm mixing up the details. Let me try to visualize the scene. Peter Fonda's character, Wyatt, has a jacket with a specific emblem. I'm pretty sure it's not the peace symbol because the main symbol in the movie that stands out is the American flag. Or was it the peace symbol?

Wait, no, the famous scene where they have the flag on their vests. Oh, but the question is about the back of the leather jacket. So maybe it's the American flag. Or perhaps the pair of dice. I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, maybe the emblem is the peace symbol. I think I remember seeing a peace sign on his jacket. But I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, the pair of dice is another possibility because I think that's a biker symbol, like for a club or something.

Wait, in the movie, the main characters have a lot of symbolic items. The American flag is a big part of the movie's imagery, especially when they ride into the desert waving it. But I don't think it's on the back of the jacket. Maybe it's on the vest or somewhere else.

Alternatively, the pair of dice is a common biker emblem, like the Wild Hogs or something. I think that's what it is. So the emblem on the back is a pair of dice, which is option I.

Wait, but I'm not entirely certain. Another thought: the main symbol I remember is the peace sign. Or maybe it's the American flag. I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, let me think again. The movie's opening scene shows them burning money, which ties into the peace and love theme. The peace symbol is more associated with the counterculture movement, which the characters are part of. So maybe the emblem is the peace symbol, which is option B.

But earlier, I thought it was the pair of dice. Now I'm confused. I think I need to decide based on what I remember more clearly.

I think the correct answer is the pair of dice. So the emblem is a pair of dice, which is option I.
