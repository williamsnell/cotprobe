Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this economics question about Keynes and his views on government intervention and the market economy. The question is whether Keynes was against the market economy because he supported government intervention, given that classical and neoclassical theorists usually opposed such intervention.

First, I remember that classical economists like Adam Smith believed in the invisible hand and minimal government involvement. Neoclassical or marginalist economists also generally support free markets. Keynes, on the other hand, was different because he focused a lot on government intervention, especially during economic downturns.

The question is asking if Keynes was against the market economy because he supported government intervention. So, I need to see what the options say.

Looking at the options:

A: Keynes supported a market economy with equal government and private enterprise control. Hmm, that sounds like a mixed economy, which I think is correct. Keynes didn't want to abolish the market; he wanted the government to play a role alongside private enterprise.

B: Keynes was completely against government intervention. No, that's the opposite. Keynes actually advocated for more government intervention.

C: Keynes believed in a completely free private enterprise economy. Again, no. He was against completely free because he saw the need for government action.

D: Only minor tweaks. I don't think so. Keynesian policies often involve significant government spending and regulation to manage the economy.

E: Intervention only in times of war or crisis. While he supported intervention during crises, he also believed in ongoing policies to stabilize the economy, not just during wars or emergencies.

F: Mixed economy with minimal roles. No, because Keynes wanted a stronger government role, not minimal.

G: Pure government-run economy. That's more like socialism or centrally planned economies, which isn't what Keynes advocated.

H: Abolish private ownership. No, Keynes didn't aim for that; he wanted to support the market with government help.

I: Replace the market system. No, he wanted to stabilize it, not replace it.

J: Stabilize the market economy. Yes, that sounds right. Keynes wanted the government to step in to prevent extreme fluctuations, like in the Great Depression, but he didn't want to eliminate the market system entirely.

So putting it all together, the correct answer should be A or J. But wait, option A says equal control between government and private enterprise, which might be a bit strong. Keynes supported a mixed economy where the government plays a significant role but doesn't take over completely. Option J says he aimed to stabilize the market, which aligns with his policies of using fiscal and monetary policies to manage economic cycles.

Wait, but option A is about equal control. I'm not sure if "equal" is the right term. Keynes probably supported the market but with more government intervention when needed, not necessarily equal control. So maybe J is better. He aimed to stabilize, not to have equal control. So the answer is J.

The question asks whether Keynes was against the market economy because he supported government intervention. Keynes advocated for a mixed economy where the government plays a role in stabilizing the market, particularly during economic downturns, rather than replacing the market system entirely. 

Analyzing the options, the correct answer is:

J: Keynes aimed to stabilize the market economy.

The answer is J.
