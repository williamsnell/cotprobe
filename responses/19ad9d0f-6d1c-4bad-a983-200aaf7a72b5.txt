Okay, so I have this problem about calculating the heat of fusion of sucrose. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

Alright, the question says that at 25°C, sucrose and water form an ideal solution. The solubility is 6.2 molal. I need to find the heat of fusion of sucrose. They also give the molecular weight of sucrose as 342, its melting point is 200°C, and the heat of fusion of water is 1400 cal/mole.

Wait, so what do I know about heat of fusion? Heat of fusion is the energy required to melt a solid at its melting point. It's usually given per mole of the substance. So, I think I need to calculate the heat required to melt sucrose, considering the solution's properties.

Since the solution is ideal, I can probably use Raoult's Law or something related to colligative properties. But wait, the problem gives solubility, which is the number of moles of solute per solvent. Here, it's 6.2 molal, which means 6.2 moles of sucrose per 1000 grams of water.

Oh, right! The solubility at 25°C is given, but the melting point is 200°C. So, I'm not sure if the solubility is relevant here. Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the solubility to find the heat of fusion. Or maybe it's about using the solution's properties to find the heat of fusion. Alternatively, perhaps it's a phase change problem where the heat of fusion relates to the solution's melting point.

Wait, another approach: The heat of fusion (ΔH_fus) is the energy required to melt one mole of a solid. For pure substances, this is straightforward, but since we're dealing with a solution, maybe the freezing point depression or something similar is involved. But wait, the problem gives the melting point of sucrose as 200°C, which is higher than water's 0°C. So, perhaps when sucrose is dissolved in water, the solution's melting point is lower? Or maybe the problem isn't directly about that.

Alternatively, maybe the heat of fusion is calculated using the solubility and the heat of solution. Wait, the heat of solution is the energy change when a solute dissolves. But the problem gives the heat of fusion of water, which is 1400 cal/mole. Wait, water's heat of fusion is 1400 cal/mol, which I know is correct because I remember water's heat of fusion is about 80 cal/g, and since water is about 18g/mol, 80*18 is 1440, which rounds to 1400 cal/mol. So that part checks out.

Wait, but how does this relate to sucrose's heat of fusion? Hmm. Maybe the problem is about using the solubility and the heat of solution to find the heat of fusion. Or perhaps it's about the phase change at the melting point.

Wait, another thought: When a solute is dissolved in a solvent, the solution's freezing point decreases. The formula is ΔTf = Kf * m, where Kf is the freezing point depression constant, m is molality of solute. But wait, I'm not sure if that's directly applicable here because we're looking for the heat of fusion, not the freezing point change.

Wait, maybe the problem is simpler. The heat of fusion of a solution can be calculated using the formula: ΔH_fus = (mass of solute * heat of fusion of solute) + (mass of solvent * heat of fusion of solvent). But I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Alternatively, perhaps the solution's heat of fusion is a weighted average based on the mole fractions.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to outline what I know:

- Sucrose is the solute, water is the solvent.
- Solubility is 6.2 molal, meaning 6.2 moles of sucrose per 1000g of water.
- Molecular weight of sucrose is 342 g/mol. So, 6.2 moles is 6.2 * 342 = let's calculate that: 6 * 342=2052, 0.2*342=68.4, total 2120.4 grams of sucrose per 1000g water.
- The total mass of solution is 1000g + 2120.4g = 3120.4g.
- Mole fraction of sucrose: moles_sucrose / (moles_sucrose + moles_water).

Moles of sucrose: 6.2 mol.

Moles of water: 1000g / 18g/mol ≈ 55.556 mol.

So mole fraction of sucrose, X_suc = 6.2 / (6.2 +55.556) ≈ 6.2 /61.756 ≈ 0.1004.

Similarly, X_water = 55.556 /61.756 ≈ 0.900.

Now, the heat of fusion for the solution would involve both components. The formula for the heat of fusion of a solution is ΔH_fus = X_suc * ΔH_fus,suc + X_water * ΔH_fus,water.

Wait, but the problem is to find the heat of fusion of sucrose, not the solution. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the solubility to find the heat of solution, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The question asks for the heat of fusion of sucrose, given its melting point and the solubility, along with the heat of fusion of water.

Wait, maybe the problem is using the solubility to find the mole fraction, and then using that to find the heat of fusion. Alternatively, perhaps the heat of fusion of the solution is being considered, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach: The heat of fusion for the solution would be the sum of the heat of fusions of the components multiplied by their mole fractions. But since the solution is ideal, perhaps we can use this approach.

So, the heat of fusion for the solution (ΔH_fus_solution) = X_suc * ΔH_fus,suc + X_water * ΔH_fus,water.

But I don't know ΔH_fus_solution, so maybe that's not helpful.

Wait, perhaps the problem is giving the solubility at 25°C, but the melting point of sucrose is 200°C. So maybe the solution's melting point is being considered, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the solubility to find the heat of solution, which is the enthalpy change when the solute dissolves. The heat of solution is typically calculated using the formula ΔH_sol = ΔH_fus,solvent + n * ΔH_fus,solute - Q, where Q is the heat released or absorbed during dissolution. But I'm not sure if that's applicable here.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of the basic approach. The heat of fusion is the energy needed to melt one mole of a solid. So, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the heat of fusion of sucrose, given its molecular weight and the heat of fusion of water, but I'm not sure how the solubility and molecular weight come into play.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the solubility to find the number of moles in a certain amount of solution, and then using that to calculate the heat of fusion. But I'm not seeing the connection.

Wait, another idea: Maybe the problem is about calculating the heat of solution when the solution is formed, but that's about dissolution, not fusion.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the solubility to find the mole fraction, and then using the mole fraction to find the heat of fusion based on the solution's properties. But I'm not clear on how that would work.

Wait, maybe I should look for a formula that relates solubility, molecular weight, and heat of fusion. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula for the freezing point depression, but that relates to the molality and Kf, not directly to the heat of fusion.

Wait, perhaps the heat of fusion of the solution can be calculated using the formula ΔH_fus_solution = (mass_suc * ΔH_fus,suc + mass_water * ΔH_fus,water) / (mass_suc + mass_water). But again, I don't know the solution's heat of fusion, so that's not helpful.

Wait, maybe I'm making this too complicated. Let me try to think differently. The problem gives the solubility as 6.2 molal, which is moles of solute per kg of solvent. The molecular weight of sucrose is 342 g/mol. So, 6.2 moles would weigh 6.2 * 342 = let's calculate that: 6*342=2052, 0.2*342=68.4, so total 2120.4 grams. That's 2.1204 kg of sucrose in 1 kg of water.

But how does that help with the heat of fusion? Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the heat of fusion is related to the energy needed to melt the solution, but I'm not sure. Maybe the heat of fusion for the solution is being considered, and the formula is ΔH_fus_solution = (n_suc * ΔH_fus,suc + n_water * ΔH_fus,water) / (n_suc + n_water). 

So, let's compute that. n_suc is 6.2 moles, n_water is 1000g / 18g/mol ≈55.556 moles.

So, ΔH_fus_solution = (6.2 * ΔH_fus,suc + 55.556 * 1400) / (6.2 +55.556).

But I don't know ΔH_fus_solution, so maybe this isn't the way.

Wait, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the heat of fusion of sucrose, given that the solution's properties are known, but I'm not seeing the direct link.

Wait, another angle: The heat of fusion of a solution can be calculated using the formula:

ΔH_fus = (mass_sucrose * ΔH_fus,suc + mass_water * ΔH_fus,water) / (mass_sucrose + mass_water)

But again, without knowing ΔH_fus for the solution, I can't find ΔH_fus,suc.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the fact that the solution is ideal, so the heat of fusion is a weighted average based on the mole fractions. So, using the formula:

ΔH_fus_solution = X_suc * ΔH_fus,suc + X_water * ΔH_fus,water.

But without knowing ΔH_fus_solution, I can't solve for ΔH_fus,suc.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for another approach. Perhaps the problem is using the solubility to find the number of moles in a certain mass of solution, and then using that to find the heat of fusion.

Wait, another thought: The heat of fusion for a solution can be found using the formula:

ΔH_fus = (mass_suc * ΔH_fus,suc + mass_water * ΔH_fus,water) / (mass_suc + mass_water)

But I don't have ΔH_fus for the solution. So maybe that's not it.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply giving extra information, and the heat of fusion of sucrose can be found using the molecular weight and the heat of fusion of water. But I'm not sure how.

Wait, maybe the problem is expecting me to calculate the heat of solution and then relate it to the heat of fusion. The heat of solution (ΔH_solution) is the enthalpy change when the solute dissolves. It can be calculated using the formula:

ΔH_solution = ΔH_fus,solvent + n * ΔH_fus,solute - Q,

where Q is the heat absorbed or released during dissolution. But without knowing ΔH_solution or Q, I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating and the problem is simply expecting me to calculate the heat of fusion of sucrose using the given data without involving the solubility. But that seems unlikely because the solubility is provided.

Wait, maybe the problem is using the solubility to find the mole fraction, and then using that to find the heat of fusion. Let me try that.

Earlier, I calculated the mole fraction of sucrose as approximately 0.1004. So, X_suc ≈ 0.1.

The formula for the heat of fusion of the solution would then be:

ΔH_fus_solution = X_suc * ΔH_fus,suc + X_water * ΔH_fus,water.

But without knowing ΔH_fus_solution, I can't find ΔH_fus,suc.

Wait, unless the problem assumes that the heat of fusion of the solution is the same as that of water, which doesn't make sense because adding a solute should change it.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the heat of fusion of the solution, but the question says "heat of fusion of sucrose", so that's not it.

Wait, another approach: The heat of fusion of the solution can be calculated using the formula:

ΔH_fus = (n_suc * ΔH_fus,suc + n_water * ΔH_fus,water) / (n_suc + n_water)

So, plugging in the numbers:

n_suc =6.2 mol,

n_water =55.556 mol,

ΔH_fus,water =1400 cal/mol,

ΔH_fus,suc = ?

So,

ΔH_fus_solution = (6.2 * ΔH_fus,suc + 55.556 *1400 ) / (6.2 +55.556)

But I don't know ΔH_fus_solution. So perhaps the problem is requiring me to use another approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the solution's melting point is 200°C, same as sucrose's. But that can't be right because adding a solute usually lowers the melting point.

Wait, maybe the problem is using the solubility to find the mole fraction and then using that mole fraction in the heat of fusion formula. But I'm still stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to calculate the heat of solution and then relate it to the heat of fusion. But I'm not seeing the connection.

Wait, maybe the problem is simpler than I'm making it. Let me think again. The heat of fusion is the energy needed to melt one mole of the substance. Since the solubility is given, perhaps the problem is asking for the heat of solution, but the question says heat of fusion, so that's not it.

Wait, perhaps the problem is giving the solubility to find the number of moles in the solution, but I'm not sure how that relates to the heat of fusion.

Wait, another idea: Maybe the heat of fusion is being calculated using the solubility and the heat of fusion of water, but I'm not seeing the direct formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula for the heat of solution in terms of the heat of fusion. For example, when a solute dissolves, it may go through melting (fusion) and then mixing. So, the heat of solution could be related to the heat of fusion of the solute and the solvent.

Wait, the heat of solution (ΔH_solution) is given by:

ΔH_solution = ΔH_fus,solvent + n * ΔH_fus,solute - Q,

where Q is the heat from the dissolution process.

But without knowing ΔH_solution or Q, I can't proceed.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the fact that the solution is ideal and thus, the heat of solution is zero, implying that the heat of fusion is the same as that of the solvent. But that doesn't make sense because the solute's heat of fusion would still be significant.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the heat of fusion of the solution, not the pure substance. But the question is about sucrose's heat of fusion, so that's not it.

Hmm, I'm going in circles here. Maybe I should try to look up similar problems or think about the concepts involved.

Wait, another angle: The heat of fusion of a solution can be calculated using the formula:

ΔH_fus_solution = (mass_suc * ΔH_fus,suc + mass_water * ΔH_fus,water) / (mass_suc + mass_water)

But again, without knowing ΔH_fus_solution, I can't find ΔH_fus,suc.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the solubility to find the mass of sucrose in a certain amount of solution, then using that to find the heat of fusion. For example, 6.2 molal means 6.2 moles in 1 kg of water. So, 6.2 *342 g = 2120.4g sucrose in 1000g water. Total solution mass is 3120.4g.

But without knowing the heat of fusion of the solution, I can't proceed.

Wait, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the heat of fusion of sucrose using the given data, but I'm not sure. Maybe the molecular weight is a red herring, or perhaps it's used to find the number of moles in a given mass.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the solubility to find the mole fraction and then using that in the calculation of the heat of fusion. But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I should try to approximate. The options are between 3000 and 4100 calories. Water's heat of fusion is 1400 cal/mol. Sucrose is a larger molecule. So its heat of fusion would be higher.

Wait, but wait, sucrose is a solid with a higher melting point (200°C) than water (0°C). So, the heat of fusion should be higher than water's. So, options are from 3000 to 4100. So, looking at the options, I'm thinking it's in that range.

But how to calculate it? Maybe the problem is using the solubility and the heat of solution to find the heat of fusion. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula where the heat of fusion of the solution is a weighted average, but without knowing the solution's heat of fusion, I can't find the solute's.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the fact that the solution's heat of fusion is the same as that of water because it's an ideal solution. That doesn't make sense because the presence of sucrose would change the heat of fusion.

Wait, maybe the problem is simpler than I'm making it. Maybe it's just asking to calculate the heat of fusion based on the given data, perhaps using the molecular weight and other factors. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: The heat of fusion is the energy needed to melt one mole of the substance. For sucrose, which has a molecular weight of 342 g/mol, the molar mass is 342 g/mol. The heat of fusion is typically in cal/mol or J/mol. Given that water's heat of fusion is 1400 cal/mol, perhaps the problem is expecting me to find a similar value for sucrose, but adjusted for molecular weight or something else.

Wait, but the options are all higher than 3000 cal/mol, which is about 3 kcal/mol. Water's is 1.4 kcal/mol, so perhaps the answer is higher because sucrose is a larger molecule, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the problem is using the formula where the heat of fusion of the solution is the sum of the heat of fusions of the components multiplied by their mole fractions. So, ΔH_fus_solution = X_suc * ΔH_fus,suc + X_water * ΔH_fus,water.

But without knowing ΔH_fus_solution, I can't solve for ΔH_fus,suc.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the fact that the solution's heat of fusion is the same as that of the pure solvent, but that's not correct. I'm stuck.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to use the solubility to find the number of moles and then use that to find the heat of fusion. For example, 6.2 molal is 6.2 moles per kg of water. So, for 1 kg of water, 6.2 moles of sucrose are dissolved. The heat of fusion would then be 6.2 * ΔH_fus,suc, but I'm not sure how that helps.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the fact that the heat of solution is equal to the heat of fusion of the solute. But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I should give up and make an educated guess. The options are from 3000 to 4100 cal/mol. Water is 1400, so perhaps sucrose's is higher. Looking at the options, perhaps 3650 (A), 3750 (B), etc.

Wait, another thought: The heat of fusion can be calculated using the formula ΔH_fus = T_m * ΔS_fus, where ΔS_fus is the entropy of fusion. But without knowing the entropy change, I can't use this.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the solubility to find the molar concentration and then relate that to the heat of fusion. But I'm not seeing the connection.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the fact that the solution is ideal to apply Raoult's Law, but I'm not sure how that relates to heat of fusion.

I'm really stuck here. Maybe I should consider that the heat of fusion of the solution is the sum of the heat of fusions of the components multiplied by their mole fractions. So,

ΔH_fus_solution = (6.2 * ΔH_fus,suc + 55.556 * 1400) / (6.2 +55.556)

But I don't know ΔH_fus_solution. So perhaps the problem is expecting me to assume that the solution's heat of fusion is the same as that of water, which would be 1400 cal/mol. But that doesn't make sense because the solution would have a different heat of fusion.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the molecular weight to scale the heat of fusion. For example, since sucrose has a molecular weight of 342, maybe the heat of fusion is 342 * some factor. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is using the solubility to find the number of moles and then multiply by the heat of fusion of water. But that seems off.

Wait, another angle: The heat of fusion of a solution can be calculated using the formula:

ΔH_fus = (n_suc * ΔH_fus,suc + n_water * ΔH_fus,water) / (n_suc + n_water)

Assuming that the solution's heat of fusion is known, but I don't have that value.

Wait, perhaps the problem is expecting me to use the fact that the solution's melting point is the same as sucrose's, which is 200°C, but that's not correct because the presence of solute usually lowers the melting point.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the solubility to find the mole fraction, and then using that mole fraction in the calculation of the heat of fusion. For example, X_suc ≈0.1, so ΔH_fus,suc would be higher than water's.

Wait, but without more data, I can't proceed. I think I'm stuck and need to make an educated guess.

Given that the options are in the range of 3000-4100 cal/mol, and knowing that the heat of fusion increases with molecular weight and melting point, I'm leaning towards option B: 3750 cal/mol or option H: 3800 cal/mol. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: The heat of fusion is also related to the enthalpy change when the solid is melted. For a solution, the heat of fusion would be the sum of the heat required to melt each component. So, perhaps the formula is:

ΔH_fus = n_suc * ΔH_fus,suc + n_water * ΔH_fus,water.

But without knowing ΔH_fus, I can't solve for ΔH_fus,suc.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the fact that the solution's heat of fusion is the same as that of the solvent, but that's not correct. Alternatively, maybe the problem is using the solvent's heat of fusion as the basis, but I'm not sure.

I think I've exhausted all my options. I'll have to make a guess. Looking at the options, I think the correct answer is B:3750 cal/mol.
</think>

The problem involves calculating the heat of fusion of sucrose given its molecular weight, solubility, and the heat of fusion of water. The solubility of sucrose is 6.2 molal, meaning 6.2 moles of sucrose dissolve in 1000 g of water. The molecular weight of sucrose is 342 g/mol, and the heat of fusion of water is 1400 cal/mol. 

To find the heat of fusion of sucrose, the approach involves considering the heat of fusion of the solution as a weighted average of the heat of fusion of sucrose and water, based on their mole fractions. The mole fraction of sucrose is calculated as:

\[
X_{\text{suc}} = \frac{6.2}{6.2 + 55.556} \approx 0.1004
\]

Using the formula for the heat of fusion of the solution:

\[
\Delta H_{\text{fus}}^{\text{solution}} = X_{\text{suc}} \cdot \Delta H_{\text{fus,suc}} + X_{\text{water}} \cdot \Delta H_{\text{fus,water}}
\]

However, without knowing the heat of fusion of the solution, directly solving for the heat of fusion of sucrose is not possible. Given the options and the reasoning that sucrose's heat of fusion should be higher than water's due to its larger molecular weight and higher melting point, an educated guess is made. Among the provided options, the most plausible answer is **3750 cal/mol**.

Answer: B
