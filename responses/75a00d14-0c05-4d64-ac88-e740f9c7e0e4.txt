Okay, so I have this question about Yiddish and I need to figure out which word means "covenant." The options are A: Haggadah, B: Halakhah, C: Brit, and D: Bris. Hmm, I'm not very familiar with Yiddish terms, but I remember some from my studies.

First, I'll try to recall what each term means. Haggadah sounds familiar; I think it's related to the Passover story. Yeah, the Haggadah is the text recited during the Seder meal, so that's probably not covenant. 

Halakhah rings a bell as well. I believe that refers to Jewish law or the legal aspects of Judaism. So that's more about laws and regulations rather than a covenant. So B is probably not the answer.

Brit and Bris are both options. I know that in some contexts, Brit refers to circumcision, but wait, isn't Bris also a term related to that? Oh, wait, in Hebrew, Bris is the term for circumcision, which is a covenant between God and Abraham. So in Yiddish, the term would likely be Bris because it directly relates to the covenant.

Wait, but sometimes Brit is used too. Let me think. Brit can mean "covenant" in general, like the covenant between God and the people. But in Yiddish, I think Bris is the more common term, especially when referring to the circumcision covenant. Alternatively, maybe Brit is the Hebrew term and Bris is the Yiddish version. Or perhaps they are both used but in different contexts.

Alternatively, I might be mixing up terms. Let me try to break it down. The covenant between God and Abraham is called Brit in Hebrew, and Bris is the circumcision itself, which is a sign of that covenant. But in Yiddish, perhaps the term used is Brit as well. Or maybe Bris is the Yiddish term for covenant, especially in the context of the circumcision.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me try to remember. In Yiddish, the word for covenant is Bris because it's derived from the Hebrew Brit, which means both "covenant" and " circumcision." So in Yiddish, Bris is used for the covenant, especially the one with Abraham. So the answer is D: Bris.

The word for covenant in Yiddish is **Bris**, which comes from the Hebrew term **Brit**. Bris specifically refers to the covenant between God and Abraham, often associated with circumcision as a sign of that covenant.
