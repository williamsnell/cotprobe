Okay, so I have this question about the proportion of babies with identifiable abnormalities at birth. I'm not exactly sure about the exact number, but I'll try to think through it. 

First, I remember that birth defects are a significant public health issue. I think the rate is somewhere around 1-2% of all births. Wait, 1% would be 1 in 100, right? Because 1% of 100 is 1. So that's option A. But I'm not 100% certain. 

Let me think again. I've heard that about 3% of babies have some kind of birth defect. That would be roughly 1 in 33, but that's not one of the options. Hmm, maybe it's a broader category, including both major and minor abnormalities. Or perhaps the question is referring to severe abnormalities only. 

Wait, another angle: when I've read statistics before, it's often stated that about 2% of newborns have a significant birth defect. So 2% would be 1 in 50, which is option B. But I'm a bit confused because sometimes the numbers vary based on the source. 

Alternatively, maybe it's 1 in 10, which is 10%, but that seems high. I don't think 10% of babies are born with abnormalities. That would be too high. So probably not D. 

Let me consider some other possibilities. I think the most commonly cited figure is around 1-2%, which would correspond to options A (1 in 100) or B (1 in 50). Since 2% is 1 in 50, that's B. But I'm not entirely sure if the question is including all abnormalities or just the major ones. 

Wait, another thought: the March of Dimes reports that about 1 in 33 babies are born with a birth defect. That's approximately 3%, which isn't exactly an option here. The closest option is B, 1 in 50, which is 2%. So maybe the question is using a rounded figure, or it's based on older data. 

I'm a bit torn between A and B. If the proportion is 1%, that's 1 in 100 (A). If it's 2%, that's 1 in 50 (B). I think the correct answer is B, 1 in 50, because I've heard 2% cited more often in some contexts. But I'm not 100% confident. 

Wait, maybe I should think about the options again. The options are A:1/100, B:1/50, etc. So if it's 1%, that's A. If it's 2%, B. I think the correct proportion is around 2%, so B would be the answer.
