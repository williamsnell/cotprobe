Alright, so I've got this mass transfer problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. Okay, the question is about removing carbon dioxide from an aqueous solution using an air stream. The setup involves a wetted wall column, and I need to find the gas-phase mass transfer coefficient and the mass flux at a certain point.

First, let me jot down what's given. The air is flowing at 3.0 ft/sec, and the column has an internal diameter of 3 inches. The operating conditions are 10 atm and 80°F. At the specific point in the column, the CO2 concentration in the air is 1 mole percent, and in the water, it's 0.5 mole percent.

I remember that for mass transfer in such systems, especially in packed columns or wetted wall columns, the mass transfer coefficient is often calculated using the film theory or the method of stages. Since it's a wetted wall column, I think film theory might be applicable here.

The mass transfer coefficient (k) in the gas phase can be found using the formula derived from the film theory, which is k = (2 * D * v) / (1 - φ), where D is the diffusion coefficient, v is the kinematic viscosity, and φ is the fraction of the velocity that's eddy diffusion. Wait, no, that might not be exactly right. Alternatively, another approach is to use the analogy between momentum and mass transfer, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the Sherwood number approach. The Sherwood number (Sh) is used to relate the mass transfer coefficient to the Reynolds and Schmidt numbers. The formula is Sh = (k * L) / (D * κ), where L is the characteristic length, D is the molecular diffusivity, and κ is the thermal conductivity. But I'm not sure if that's the right path because I don't have all the necessary properties at 80°F and 10 atm.

Alternatively, for a wetted wall column, the mass transfer coefficient can be calculated using the formula:

k = (u * d / (1 - φ)) * (1 - (φ / (1 - φ)))

Wait, maybe that's not it either. Let me think differently. In a wetted wall column, the mass transfer coefficient is often found using the equation:

k = (2 * u * d) / (1 + φ)

But I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should look for a simpler approach, like using the relation between the concentration difference and the mass flux.

Wait, the problem asks for both the mass transfer coefficient and the mass flux. I think mass flux (J) is given by J = k * (y2 - y1), where y2 and y1 are the concentrations in the gas phase at two points, perhaps the entering and exiting concentrations. But in this case, they give the concentration at a point in the column, so maybe it's a single point calculation.

Wait, no. The question states that at that point, the air has 1 mole% CO2 and the water has 0.5 mole%. So perhaps the concentration gradient is between these two points. But how does that translate into the mass transfer coefficient?

Alternatively, maybe I should consider the overall mass transfer rate equation. The mass flux J can be expressed as J = (k * (y_air - y_water)) / (1 - (y_water / y_air)). Wait, no, that might not be correct. Alternatively, perhaps it's J = k * (y_gas - y_liquid) / (1 - (y_liquid / y_gas)), but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the mass transfer coefficient k is often calculated using the equation based on the velocity and the diffusion coefficient. But I don't have the diffusion coefficient for CO2 in air at 80°F and 10 atm. Alternatively, perhaps I can use an empirical correlation.

Wait, perhaps for a wetted wall column, the mass transfer coefficient can be estimated using the formula:

k = (u * d) / (1 + (u * d / v))

Where u is the velocity, d is the diameter, and v is the kinematic viscosity. But I'm not sure if that's the correct formula.

Wait, let me think again. The gas-phase mass transfer coefficient (k) can be calculated using the formula:

k = (2 * u * d) / (1 + (u * d / v))

But I'm not certain about the exact formula. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is k = (u * d) / (1 + (u * d / v)), but again, I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should first calculate the Reynolds number to determine if the flow is laminar or turbulent, which might help in choosing the right correlation for k.

The Reynolds number (Re) is given by Re = (u * d) / v, where u is the velocity, d is the diameter, and v is the kinematic viscosity of air at the given conditions.

Wait, the diameter is 3 inches, which is 0.25 feet. The velocity u is 3.0 ft/s.

So Re = (3 ft/s * 0.25 ft) / v. But I need the kinematic viscosity v at 80°F and 10 atm. I might need to estimate this.

At standard conditions (1 atm), the kinematic viscosity of air at 80°F is approximately 0.374 ft²/s. But since the pressure is higher (10 atm), the density increases, so the viscosity would increase as well. Wait, kinematic viscosity is dynamic viscosity divided by density. At higher pressure, both dynamic viscosity and density increase, but their ratio might change.

Alternatively, perhaps the effect is small, and we can approximate v as similar to standard conditions. Let me proceed with v ≈ 0.374 ft²/s for 80°F.

So Re = (3 * 0.25) / 0.374 ≈ 0.75 / 0.374 ≈ 2.005. So Re is about 2, which is well below the critical Reynolds number for transition (around 2100 for pipe flow), so the flow is laminar.

In laminar flow, the mass transfer coefficient can be estimated using the formula for a wetted wall column. I think for laminar flow, the coefficient is given by:

k = (2 * u * d) / (1 + (u * d / v)) )

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's:

k = (u * d) / (1 + (u * d / v))

Wait, let me see. Another formula I've heard about is the Higbie's penetration theory, which might be applicable here. For a wetted wall column, Higbie's theory gives the mass transfer coefficient as:

k = (u * d) / (1 + (u * d / v))

So let's calculate that.

u = 3 ft/s, d = 0.25 ft, v = 0.374 ft²/s.

So u*d = 3 * 0.25 = 0.75 ft²/s.

Then u*d / v = 0.75 / 0.374 ≈ 2.005.

So 1 + (u*d/v) = 1 + 2.005 ≈ 3.005.

So k = (3 * 0.25) / 3.005 ≈ 0.75 / 3.005 ≈ 0.2496 ft/s.

Wait, that seems low. But wait, the units don't match because the options are in ft/hr, not ft/s.

So to convert ft/s to ft/hr, multiply by 3600.

0.2496 ft/s * 3600 ≈ 899 ft/hr, which is about 900 ft/hr. But looking at the options, the highest is 93 ft/hr, so that can't be right. I must have made a mistake.

Wait, that can't be correct because the options are much lower. Maybe I used the wrong formula.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for the mass transfer coefficient in a packed column, such as the one involving the height of the packing and the liquid velocity, but that doesn't seem applicable here since it's a wetted wall.

Wait, perhaps I should recall that the mass transfer coefficient is often given in terms of the velocity and the diameter, perhaps using a different approach. Alternatively, perhaps I'm confusing the mass transfer coefficient with the convective mass transfer term.

Wait, another approach: the mass flux J can be calculated using J = k * (y_gas - y_water) / (1 - y_water/y_gas), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's J = k * (y_gas - y_water) * (1 - (y_water / y_gas)).

Wait, perhaps I should think about the equilibrium relation. The mass transfer is driven by the concentration difference between the gas and liquid phases. Assuming that the solution is well-mixed and at equilibrium, the concentration in the liquid is related to that in the gas by the partition coefficient.

But the problem gives the concentrations at a particular point, so maybe I can relate the mass flux from that.

Alternatively, perhaps the mass flux is simply J = k * (y_gas - y_water) / (1 - y_water/y_gas), but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me look for another approach. The problem gives the concentrations in the gas and liquid, so maybe I can find the driving force and then relate it to the mass transfer coefficient.

The driving force for mass transfer is the difference in partial pressures or mole fractions between the gas and liquid. Assuming that the liquid is in equilibrium with the gas, the driving force would be the difference between the gas-phase and liquid-phase concentrations.

So the mass flux J would be k * (y_gas - y_water) / (1 - y_water/y_gas). Wait, that seems a bit off.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is J = k * (y_gas - y_water) * (1 - (y_water / y_gas)).

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

The mass flux (J) is given by J = k * (y2 - y1), where y2 is the concentration in the gas phase at the point of interest, and y1 is the concentration in the liquid. But wait, that can't be right because the units don't match. Alternatively, perhaps it's J = k * (y_gas - y_water) / (1 - (y_water / y_gas)).

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula:

J = k * (y_gas - y_water) / (1 - (y_water / y_gas))

But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think about the units. The mass transfer coefficient k has units of (length/time), and the concentrations are mole fractions, which are dimensionless. So the mass flux J would have units of (mole fraction * length/time), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps J has units of (mass)/(area*time), which would be lb_mol/(ft²·hr), as in the options.

Wait, maybe I should consider the overall mass balance. The mass flux J is the rate at which CO2 is transferred per unit area. So J = k * (y_gas - y_water) / (1 - y_water/y_gas). Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the concentration difference first. The gas has 1 mole% CO2, and the water has 0.5 mole%. So the difference is 0.5 mole%.

But mole fractions are involved, so perhaps the driving force is (y_gas - y_water) = 0.01 - 0.005 = 0.005.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact expression for J.

Alternatively, perhaps the mass flux J is given by J = (k * (y_gas - y_water)) / (1 - y_water/y_gas).

Plugging in the numbers: y_gas = 0.01, y_water = 0.005.

So y_water/y_gas = 0.005 / 0.01 = 0.5.

So 1 - 0.5 = 0.5.

So J = k * (0.005) / 0.5 = k * 0.01.

But I don't know J yet, so this doesn't help directly.

Wait, but another approach: perhaps I should first calculate the mass transfer coefficient k using the flow conditions, and then use it to find the mass flux.

Earlier, when I tried using Higbie's formula, I got k ≈ 0.2496 ft/s, which converts to about 899 ft/hr. But the options are much lower, so perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, maybe I should use the formula for k in a packed column, where k = (u * d) / (1 + (u * d / v)).

Wait, let's recalculate that.

u = 3 ft/s, d = 0.25 ft, v = 0.374 ft²/s.

u*d = 3 * 0.25 = 0.75 ft²/s.

u*d / v = 0.75 / 0.374 ≈ 2.005.

So 1 + (u*d/v) = 3.005.

k = (3 * 0.25) / 3.005 ≈ 0.75 / 3.005 ≈ 0.2496 ft/s.

Convert to ft/hr: 0.2496 * 3600 ≈ 899 ft/hr. But the options don't go that high. So perhaps I'm using the wrong formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is k = (u * d) / (1 + (u * d / v)) * (some factor). Or maybe I'm using the wrong approach.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula for the mass transfer coefficient in terms of the Sherwood number. The Sherwood number for internal flow in a pipe is given by:

Sh = (Re * Sc) / (1 + (Re * Sc / 300))

Where Re is Reynolds number, Sc is Schmidt number.

The Schmidt number Sc is (μ / (ρ D)), where D is the molecular diffusivity of CO2 in air.

But I don't have D, so maybe I can find it. Alternatively, perhaps I can estimate D for CO2 in air at 80°F and 1 atm. But wait, the pressure is 10 atm, which might affect the diffusivity.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the given data to find D. Hmm, but without more information, this might be tricky.

Alternatively, perhaps I can look up typical values. At 25°C and 1 atm, D_CO2 in air is about 0.16 cm²/s. But at higher temperatures, it increases. Let's estimate D at 80°F (27°C) as maybe 0.18 cm²/s. But I'm not sure.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should think differently. The problem gives the concentrations, so perhaps I can find the mass flux directly using the concentration difference and flow rate.

Wait, the mass flux J is the amount of CO2 transferred per unit area per unit time. So J = (k * (y_gas - y_water)) / (1 - (y_water / y_gas)).

But without knowing k, I can't find J. Alternatively, maybe I can find k using the flow rate and then find J.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the mass transfer coefficient using the given data. Let me see.

Wait, another approach: the mass transfer coefficient can be found using the formula:

k = (u * d) / (1 + (u * d / v)).

Which, as before, gives k ≈ 0.2496 ft/s, which is 899 ft/hr. But none of the options are close to that, so I must be making a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should check the units again. Kinematic viscosity v is in ft²/s. Let me confirm the value of v at 80°F.

At standard conditions (1 atm, 60°F), the kinematic viscosity of air is about 0.374 ft²/s. At 80°F, it's higher. Wait, no, higher temperatures decrease viscosity. So at 80°F, v would be lower than 0.374 ft²/s. Let me check: the kinematic viscosity of air at 80°F (27°C) is approximately 0.374 * (27/60) ≈ 0.167 ft²/s? Wait, that doesn't make sense because viscosity usually decreases with temperature, but the exact scaling might not be linear. Alternatively, perhaps I should look up the exact value.

Wait, perhaps I can use the ideal gas law to find the molar volume, which might help in finding the diffusivity, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should proceed with the assumption that the mass transfer coefficient is given by the formula k = (u * d) / (1 + (u * d / v)).

Using v = 0.374 ft²/s, we get k ≈ 0.2496 ft/s, which is 899 ft/hr. That's not matching any options, so perhaps I'm using the wrong approach.

Wait, perhaps the formula for k is different. Another formula I've heard is for a packed column, where k = (u * d) / (1 + (u * d / v)), but perhaps this is for liquid flow, not gas.

Wait, in this case, the air is the gas phase, so perhaps the formula is adapted for the gas. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for the gas-phase mass transfer coefficient as k = (u * d) / (1 + (u * d / v_gas)).

Wait, but I'm using the same v for air, so perhaps that's correct.

Alternatively, maybe I should use the mass flux formula J = (u * d * D) / (1 + (u * d / v)) * (y_gas - y_water).

But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the mass flux J is the product of the molar flow rate and the concentration difference.

The molar flow rate in the gas phase is (u * A), where A is the cross-sectional area, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps J is given by J = (u * (y_gas - y_water)) / (1 - y_water/y_gas).

But without knowing k, I can't compute J directly.

Wait, perhaps I should look for an example problem. Let's think: If the concentrations are 1% and 0.5%, then the driving force is 0.5%. The velocity is 3 ft/s, diameter 3 inches.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the mass flux J first, then find k.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to use an approximate value for k based on typical values for such columns.

Looking at the options, the mass transfer coefficients are around 80-90 ft/hr, and the mass fluxes are around 1.6 to 2.2 lb mole/hr·ft².

Wait, perhaps I should calculate J using the given concentrations and flow rate, then find k.

The flow rate is 3 ft/s, and the diameter is 3 inches (0.25 ft), so the cross-sectional area A = π*(0.25/2)^2 ≈ π*(0.125)^2 ≈ 0.0491 ft².

The volumetric flow rate Q = u * A = 3 * 0.0491 ≈ 0.1473 ft³/s.

Concentration in air is 1 mole%, so the molar flow rate of CO2 is (0.01) * Q * (density of air at 10 atm and 80°F) * molecular weight of CO2.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the density. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the ideal gas law to find the molar flow rate.

At 10 atm and 80°F, the density of air can be calculated. The ideal gas equation is PV = nRT, so density ρ = (P * M) / (R * T), where M is molar mass.

But since we're dealing with concentrations, perhaps I can find the molar flow rate as (concentration) * (volumetric flow rate).

Wait, but I'm getting stuck again.

Alternatively, perhaps the mass flux J is given by J = (u * (y_gas - y_water)) / (1 - y_water/y_gas).

So y_gas = 0.01, y_water = 0.005.

So (y_gas - y_water) = 0.005.

(1 - y_water/y_gas) = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5.

So J = (3 ft/s) * (0.005) / 0.5 = 3 * 0.01 = 0.03 lb mole/(ft²·s).

Convert to lb mole/(ft²·hr): 0.03 * 3600 ≈ 108 lb mole/(ft²·hr). But that's way higher than the options, so I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I forgot to consider the molecular weight or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula J = k * (y_gas - y_water) / (1 - y_water/y_gas).

But without knowing k, I can't find J.

Wait, maybe I should reverse-engineer using the options. Let's see.

Suppose the correct answer is option I: 89 ft/hr and 1.83 lb mole/hr·ft².

If k is 89 ft/hr, which is 89/3600 ≈ 0.0247 ft/s.

Then J = k * (y_gas - y_water) / (1 - y_water/y_gas) = 0.0247 * (0.005) / 0.5 = 0.0247 * 0.01 = 0.000247 lb mole/(ft²·s).

Wait, that's 0.000247 * 3600 ≈ 0.89 lb mole/(ft²·hr), which is not matching the option's 1.83.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing a factor because of molecular weight or molar flow rate.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the molar flow rate of the gas and the concentration difference.

The molar flow rate in the gas phase is (u * A) * (P / (R * T)).

At 10 atm, which is 1013.27 kPa, but let's convert to psi for easier calculation. Wait, 1 atm is 14.7 psi, so 10 atm is 147 psi. But maybe it's easier to use absolute pressure in psia.

Alternatively, using the ideal gas law in consistent units.

R is 10.732 ft·lb/(lb mole·°R).

Temperature is 80°F, which is 460 + 80 = 540 °R.

So the molar flow rate n_dot = (u * A) * (P / (R * T)).

u = 3 ft/s, A = π*(0.25/2)^2 ≈ 0.0491 ft².

P = 10 atm = 10 * 14.715 psi = 147.15 psi.

But R is in ft·lb/(lb mole·°R), so I need to convert pressure to lb/in².

Wait, 1 psi = 1 lb/in², and 1 ft² = 144 in², so 1 psi = (1 lb/in²) / (144 in²/ft²) )= lb/(in²·ft²) )? Wait, maybe I'm complicating.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the relation n_dot = (u * A * P) / (R * T), where P is in absolute pressure.

So n_dot = (3 ft/s * 0.0491 ft²) * (147.15 psi) / (10.732 ft·lb/(lb mole·°R) * 540 °R).

Wait, let's compute this step by step.

First, u*A = 3 * 0.0491 ≈ 0.1473 ft³/s.

n_dot = (0.1473 ft³/s) * (147.15 psi) / (10.732 * 540).

But I'm not sure about the units here. Let me check the units:

R is 10.732 ft·lb/(lb mole·°R).

So P is in psi, which is lb/in². To convert to lb/ft², multiply by 144 (since 1 ft² = 144 in²).

So P = 147.15 psi = 147.15 * 144 lb/ft² ≈ 21231 lb/ft².

So n_dot = (0.1473 ft³/s) * (21231 lb/ft²) / (10.732 ft·lb/(lb mole·°R) * 540 °R).

Compute denominator: 10.732 * 540 ≈ 5809.68.

So n_dot ≈ (0.1473 * 21231) / 5809.68 ≈ (3122.0) / 5809.68 ≈ 0.537 lb mole/s.

So the molar flow rate is 0.537 lb mole/s.

Now, the mass flux J is the molar flow rate multiplied by the concentration difference.

Wait, but J is the rate of transfer per unit area. Alternatively, perhaps J is (n_dot) * (y_gas - y_water) / (1 - y_water/y_gas).

So J = 0.537 lb mole/s * (0.005) / 0.5 ≈ 0.537 * 0.01 = 0.00537 lb mole/(ft²·s).

Wait, that doesn't seem right because the area is already accounted for in n_dot.

Alternatively, perhaps J is (n_dot) * (y_gas - y_water) / (1 - y_water/y_gas).

So J = 0.537 lb mole/s * (0.005) / 0.5 ≈ 0.537 * 0.01 = 0.00537 lb mole/(ft²·s).

Convert to lb mole/(ft²·hr): 0.00537 * 3600 ≈ 19.33 lb mole/(ft²·hr). But the options are around 1.6 to 2.2, so this is way off. I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the molar flow rate is per unit area. Wait, n_dot is the total molar flow rate, so perhaps I should find the molar flux, which is n_dot / A.

Wait, n_dot = 0.537 lb mole/s, and A = 0.0491 ft².

So molar flux = n_dot / A = 0.537 / 0.0491 ≈ 10.93 lb mole/(ft²·s).

Then, J = (y_gas - y_water) / (1 - y_water/y_gas) * molar flux.

So J = (0.005 / 0.5) * 10.93 ≈ 0.01 * 10.93 ≈ 0.1093 lb mole/(ft²·s).

Convert to lb mole/(ft²·hr): 0.1093 * 3600 ≈ 393.5 lb mole/(ft²·hr). That's way too high; the options are around 1.6-2.2.

This suggests that I'm making a mistake in calculating n_dot. Perhaps I should re-express the molar flow rate correctly.

Wait, another approach: the molar flow rate in the gas phase is given by:

n_dot = (u * A) * (P / (R * T)) * (M_air / M_CO2)

Wait, no, because the concentration is in mole percent, so perhaps I don't need to consider molecular weights.

Alternatively, perhaps the molar flow rate of CO2 is n_dot_CO2 = (u * A) * (P / (R * T)) * (y_gas).

So y_gas is 0.01, so:

n_dot_CO2 = 3 ft/s * 0.0491 ft² * (10 atm) / (10.732 ft·lb/(lb mole·°R) * 540 °R) * 0.01.

But 10 atm = 147.15 psi = 147.15 * 144 lb/ft² ≈ 21231 lb/ft².

So n_dot_CO2 = 3 * 0.0491 * 21231 / (10.732 * 540) * 0.01.

Compute numerator: 3 * 0.0491 ≈ 0.1473; 0.1473 * 21231 ≈ 3122 lb/(s·ft).

Denominator: 10.732 * 540 ≈ 5809.68.

So n_dot_CO2 ≈ (3122 / 5809.68) * 0.01 ≈ 0.537 * 0.01 ≈ 0.00537 lb mole/s.

That's the total molar flow rate of CO2 in the gas phase. Now, the mass flux J is the rate at which CO2 is transferred per unit area.

So J = n_dot_CO2 / A = 0.00537 lb mole/s / 0.0491 ft² ≈ 0.1094 lb mole/(ft²·s).

Convert to lb mole/(ft²·hr): 0.1094 * 3600 ≈ 393.8 lb mole/(ft²·hr). Again, way too high.

This suggests that my approach is wrong. Maybe I'm confusing the driving force or the way J is calculated.

Wait, perhaps I should go back to the original approach and calculate k using Higbie's formula, then use that to find J.

Earlier, I calculated k ≈ 899 ft/hr, which is way higher than the options. But none of the options are that high, so perhaps I'm using the wrong formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula for k is different. Another formula I found is:

k = (u * d) / (1 + (u * d / v))

Using u=3 ft/s, d=0.25 ft, v=0.374 ft²/s.

u*d = 0.75 ft²/s.

u*d/v ≈ 0.75 / 0.374 ≈ 2.005.

So 1 + 2.005 = 3.005.

k = (3 * 0.25) / 3.005 ≈ 0.75 / 3.005 ≈ 0.2496 ft/s.

Convert to ft/hr: 0.2496 * 3600 ≈ 899 ft/hr.

But the options don't have this value. The closest is option A: 90, but that's only 90 ft/hr, which is way lower than my calculation.

Wait, perhaps I'm using the wrong formula for k. Another approach is to use the empirical relation for a wetted wall column, which might involve the velocity and the diameter differently.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula:

k = (u * d) / (1 + (u * d / v)) * (1 - φ), where φ is the fraction of the velocity that's turbulent.

But I don't have φ, so I can't use this.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is k = (u * d) / (1 + (u * d / v)).

Wait, that's the same as before, giving k ≈ 0.2496 ft/s = 899 ft/hr.

But this doesn't match any options. Therefore, perhaps I'm missing something in the problem statement.

Wait, the problem states that the column is a wetted wall column, which might imply that the liquid is flowing downward, but the gas is upward. However, in this problem, the air is the flowing phase, so perhaps it's a gas-liquid contact in a column where the liquid is not necessarily flowing.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the mass transfer coefficient is the same as the convective mass transfer term, which is given by k = u * d / (1 + (u * d / v)).

But again, that gives the same result.

Wait, perhaps the problem is in units. Let me check again.

Kinematic viscosity v at 80°F is about 0.374 ft²/s. But wait, that's at 1 atm. At higher pressures, the density increases, so kinematic viscosity decreases because v = μ/ρ. So at 10 atm, v would be lower than 0.374 ft²/s.

Wait, perhaps that's the key. If the pressure is 10 atm, the density is higher, so v is lower. Let me estimate v at 10 atm.

At 80°F and 1 atm, v ≈ 0.374 ft²/s.

Density of air at 1 atm: ρ = (P * M) / (R * T). M is molar mass of air ≈ 29 lb_mol.

At 1 atm, P = 14.7 psi = 14.7 lb/in² = 14.7 * 144 lb/ft² = 2116.8 lb/ft².

R = 10.732 ft·lb/(lb mole·°R).

T = 80 + 460 = 540 °R.

So ρ = (2116.8 lb/ft²) * (29 lb_mol) / (10.732 * 540) ≈ (2116.8 * 29) / (5809.68) ≈ 61387.2 / 5809.68 ≈ 10.56 lb_mol/ft³.

At 10 atm, P = 147.15 psi = 147.15 * 144 ≈ 21231 lb/ft².

So ρ = (21231 * 29) / (10.732 * 540) ≈ (615,  let me compute numerator: 21231 * 29 ≈ 615, let me compute 21231 * 29: 21231 * 30 = 636,930; subtract 21231 → 636,930 - 21,231 = 615,699.

Denominator: 10.732 * 540 ≈ 5809.68.

So ρ ≈ 615,699 / 5809.68 ≈ 105.6 lb_mol/ft³.

At 1 atm, v = 0.374 ft²/s.

At 10 atm, since v = μ/ρ, and μ (dynamic viscosity) increases with pressure, but more significantly, ρ increases, so v decreases.

But without knowing μ, it's hard to calculate v exactly. Alternatively, perhaps v scales inversely with pressure, since v = μ/ρ, and if μ increases linearly with pressure, but ρ also increases, perhaps v decreases by a factor of (P1/P2).

But this is speculative. Alternatively, perhaps I can estimate v at 10 atm as v = v1 * (P1 / P2).

At 1 atm, v1 = 0.374 ft²/s.

At 10 atm, P2 = 10 * P1, so v = 0.374 / 10 ≈ 0.0374 ft²/s.

Using v = 0.0374 ft²/s.

Now, recalculate k:

u*d = 3 * 0.25 = 0.75 ft²/s.

u*d / v = 0.75 / 0.0374 ≈ 20.05.

So 1 + (u*d/v) = 21.05.

k = (3 * 0.25) / 21.05 ≈ 0.75 / 21.05 ≈ 0.0356 ft/s.

Convert to ft/hr: 0.0356 * 3600 ≈ 128 ft/hr. Still not matching the options.

Wait, that's even lower than before, so perhaps this approach isn't correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use a standard value for k, perhaps around 85-90 ft/hr, and then find J accordingly.

Looking at the options, option E has k=85 and J=1.75.

If k=85 ft/hr, which is 85/3600 ≈ 0.0236 ft/s.

Then, J = k * (y_gas - y_water) / (1 - y_water/y_gas).

So y_gas = 0.01, y_water=0.005.

(y_gas - y_water)=0.005.

(1 - y_water/y_gas)=0.5.

So J = 0.0236 * (0.005 / 0.5) = 0.0236 * 0.01 = 0.000236 lb mole/(ft²·s).

Convert to lb mole/(ft²·hr): 0.000236 * 3600 ≈ 0.85 lb mole/(ft²·hr). But the option E has J=1.75, so this doesn't match.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the molar flow rate.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate J using the formula J = (u * (y_gas - y_water)) / (1 - y_water/y_gas).

So u=3 ft/s, (y_gas - y_water)=0.005, (1 - 0.5)=0.5.

So J = 3 * 0.005 / 0.5 = 0.03 lb mole/(ft²·s).

Convert to lb mole/(ft²·hr): 0.03 * 3600 = 108 lb mole/(ft²·hr). But that's way higher than the options.

I'm clearly making a mistake somewhere. Perhaps the problem is intended to use a simpler approach, like assuming that k is given by some standard value based on the flow conditions, without calculating it from first principles.

Looking at the options, the mass transfer coefficients are around 85-93 ft/hr, and the mass fluxes are around 1.6-2.2 lb mole/hr·ft².

Perhaps I should pick option E: 85 ft/hr and 1.75 lb mole/hr·ft².

But without a clear calculation path, this is a guess. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the mass flux J is given by J = (u * (y_gas - y_water)) / (1 - y_water/y_gas) * (1/(1 + (u*d)/v)).

Wait, using u=3, d=0.25, v=0.374:

(u*d)/v ≈ 2.005.

So 1/(1 + 2.005) ≈ 0.333.

Then J = 3 * 0.005 / 0.5 * 0.333 ≈ (0.03) * 0.333 ≈ 0.01 lb mole/(ft²·s) → 36 lb mole/(ft²·hr). Still not matching.

This is getting too time-consuming, and I'm not making progress. I think I'll have to make an educated guess based on the options and the calculations I've done.

Given that the calculated k is around 899 ft/hr, but the options are much lower, perhaps the intended approach was to use a simplified formula or to consider that the driving force is small, leading to a lower k.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option I: 89 ft/hr and 1.83 lb mole/hr·ft².

But without a clear calculation path, I'm not confident. Another way is to look for the option where J is calculated using the given k and concentrations.

For example, option I: k=89 ft/hr = 89/3600 ≈ 0.0247 ft/s.

J = k * (y_gas - y_water) / (1 - y_water/y_gas) = 0.0247 * 0.005 / 0.5 ≈ 0.000247 lb mole/(ft²·s) → 0.000247 * 3600 ≈ 0.89 lb mole/(ft²·hr). But option I's J is 1.83, so perhaps I missed a factor of 2.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the driving force is (y_gas - y_water) = 0.005, and the denominator is (1 + (y_water/y_gas)) = 1.5, but that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is J = k * (y_gas - y_water) * (1 - y_water/y_gas).

So J = 0.0247 * 0.005 * 0.5 ≈ 0.00006175 lb mole/(ft²·s) → 0.222 lb mole/(ft²·hr). Doesn't match.

I'm stuck. I'll have to make an educated guess. Given that my initial k calculation gave around 900 ft/hr, but the options are lower, perhaps the intended answer is option I: 89 ft/hr and 1.83 lb mole/hr·ft².

But another approach: perhaps the mass flux is found using J = (u * (y_gas - y_water)) / (1 - y_water/y_gas) → 3 * 0.005 / 0.5 = 0.03 lb mole/(ft²·s) = 108 lb mole/(ft²·hr). But none of the options match this. So perhaps I'm missing a factor related to molecular weight.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the molecular weight of CO2, which is 44 g/mol or 0.044 lb_mol/lb.

Wait, but I'm not sure how that fits in here. Maybe the mass flux is in lb_mol, so I don't need to adjust for molecular weight.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula J = (k * (y_gas - y_water)) / (1 - y_water/y_gas).

If I take k=85 ft/hr (option E), then J= (85/3600) * 0.005 / 0.5 ≈ 0.0236 * 0.01 ≈ 0.000236 lb mole/(ft²·s) → 0.85 lb mole/(ft²·hr). But option E's J is 1.75, which is double. So perhaps I missed a factor of 2 somewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the area is in square feet, and the velocity is in ft/s, so perhaps I need to adjust for that. But I'm not sure.

Given the time I've spent and the confusion, I'll have to make a guess. I think the intended answer is option I: 89 ft/hr and 1.83 lb mole/hr·ft².

The problem involves calculating the gas-phase mass transfer coefficient (k) and the mass flux (J) for CO₂ removal in a wetted wall column. The given data includes an air flow velocity of 3.0 ft/s, a column diameter of 3 inches, and concentrations of 1 mole% CO₂ in the air and 0.5 mole% in the water at 10 atm and 80°F. 

To determine k, Higbie's penetration theory was considered, which uses the formula:

\[
k = \frac{u \cdot d}{1 + \frac{u \cdot d}{v}}
\]

where \( u = 3 \, \text{ft/s} \), \( d = 0.25 \, \text{ft} \), and \( v \) is the kinematic viscosity of air. At 80°F, \( v \) was approximated as \( 0.374 \, \text{ft}^2/\text{s} \). Substituting these values:

\[
u \cdot d = 3 \cdot 0.25 = 0.75 \, \text{ft}^2/\text{s}
\]
\[
\frac{u \cdot d}{v} = \frac{0.75}{0.374} \approx 2.005
\]
\[
k = \frac{0.75}{1 + 2.005} \approx 0.2496 \, \text{ft/s} \, \text{(or 899 ft/hr)}.
\]

However, this value is much higher than the options provided, suggesting a potential error in the approach or assumptions. Adjustments were made by considering the effect of pressure on kinematic viscosity, but the results still did not align with the options. 

For the mass flux \( J \), the formula:

\[
J = k \cdot \frac{y_{\text{gas}} - y_{\text{water}}}{1 - \frac{y_{\text{water}}}{y_{\text{gas}}}}
\]

was used, where \( y_{\text{gas}} = 0.01 \) and \( y_{\text{water}} = 0.005 \). Despite multiple recalculations, the derived values for \( k \) and \( J \) did not match the options exactly. 

Given the complexity and the mismatch between calculated and provided values, an educated guess was made based on the closest matching option, considering potential simplifications or approximations in the problem setup.
