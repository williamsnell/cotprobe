Okay, so I have this problem where I'm given three variables a, b, and c. The problem states that a + b + c equals 6, ab + ac + bc equals 5, and abc equals -12. I need to find a³ + b³ + c³. Hmm, I remember there's a formula that relates these sums to the cubes. Let me try to recall.

I think the formula is something like a³ + b³ + c³ equals (a + b + c)³ minus 3 times (a + b + c)(ab + ac + bc) plus 3 times abc. Wait, or was it minus 3 times (ab + ac + bc) times something else? Maybe I should write it down step by step.

So, the formula I remember is:
a³ + b³ + c³ = (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + ac + bc) + 3abc.

Let me double-check that. I think that's right because when you expand (a + b + c)^3, you get a³ + b³ + c³ plus 3(a + b)(b + c)(a + c), which might relate to the other terms. Alternatively, maybe it's better to look up the correct identity, but since I can't do that right now, I'll proceed with what I think.

Given that, I can plug in the values I have from the problem.

First, let's compute each part step by step.

Given:
a + b + c = 6
ab + ac + bc = 5
abc = -12

Compute (a + b + c)^3:
6^3 = 216.

Next, compute 3(a + b + c)(ab + ac + bc):
3 * 6 * 5 = 3*30 = 90.

Then, compute 3abc:
3 * (-12) = -36.

Now, putting it all together:
a³ + b³ + c³ = 216 - 90 + (-36) ?

Wait, no, wait. Let me make sure I substitute correctly. The formula is:

a³ + b³ + c³ = (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + ac + bc) + 3abc.

So plugging in the numbers:

= 216 - 3*(6)*(5) + 3*(-12)
= 216 - 90 - 36.

Wait, because 3*(6)*(5) is 90, and 3*(-12) is -36.

So 216 minus 90 is 126, then minus 36 is 90.

Wait, but 216 - 90 is 126, then 126 - 36 is 90. So that would make a³ + b³ + c³ equal to 90.

Looking at the options, option F is 90. So that should be the answer.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the formula. Another way to think about it is that sometimes the formula is written as a³ + b³ + c³ - 3abc = (a + b + c)(a² + b² + c² - ab - bc - ac). But I'm not sure if that's helpful here, though.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute each term step by step. Let me try another approach to confirm.

I know that a³ + b³ + c³ can also be written as (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + ac + bc) + 3abc. So that's the same formula I used earlier.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the signs. Let me re-examine the formula. Maybe it's a³ + b³ + c³ = (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + ac + bc) + 3abc. Let me check that.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the expansion of (a + b + c)^3. Let me try expanding it:

(a + b + c)^3 = a³ + b³ + c³ + 3a²b + 3a²c + 3ab² + 3ac² + 3b²c + 3bc² + 6abc.

Hmm, that seems complicated. Alternatively, another way to write it is:

(a + b + c)^3 = a³ + b³ + c³ + 3(a + b)(b + c)(a + c). Wait, maybe that's not the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use the formula I have and just check my calculation again.

So, let's compute each term again:

(a + b + c)^3 = 6^3 = 216.

3(a + b + c)(ab + ac + bc) = 3 * 6 * 5 = 90.

3abc = 3*(-12) = -36.

Now, plugging into the formula:

a³ + b³ + c³ = 216 - 90 + (-36) ?

Wait, no, the formula is:

a³ + b³ + c³ = (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + ac + bc) + 3abc.

So that's 216 - 90 + (-36). Wait, no, because the formula is 216 minus 90, then plus (-36). So 216 - 90 is 126, and 126 - 36 is 90.

So the result is 90, which is option F.

Wait, but let me think again. Did I make any mistake in the signs? Because sometimes when I'm subtracting negative numbers, it's easy to get confused.

Wait, the formula is:

a³ + b³ + c³ = (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + ac + bc) + 3abc.

So, substituting:

= 216 - 3*(6)*(5) + 3*(-12)
= 216 - 90 - 36
= 216 - 126
= 90.

Yes, that seems correct. So the answer should be 90, which is option F.

The formula to find \( a^3 + b^3 + c^3 \) is:

\[
a^3 + b^3 + c^3 = (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + ac + bc) + 3abc
\]

Substituting the given values:
- \( a + b + c = 6 \)
- \( ab + ac + bc = 5 \)
- \( abc = -12 \)

Compute each term:
1. \( (a + b + c)^3 = 6^3 = 216 \)
2. \( 3(a + b + c)(ab + ac + bc) = 3 \times 6 \times 5 = 90 \)
3. \( 3abc = 3 \times (-12) = -36 \)

Plugging into the formula:
\[
a^3 + b^3 + c^3 = 216 - 90 - 36 = 90
\]

The answer is F.
