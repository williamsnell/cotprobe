Okay, so I need to find the mode of the given sample, which is the set of numbers: 14, 16, 21, 19, 18, 24, and 17. Hmm, let me remember what the mode is. From what I recall, the mode of a data set is the value that appears most frequently. 

So, first, I should probably list out all the numbers and see which one occurs the most. Let me write them down again to check: 14, 16, 21, 19, 18, 24, 17. Wait, that's seven numbers, and each seems to be unique. Let me count how many times each appears.

Starting with 14: that's just once. Then 16: also once. 21 appears once, 19 once, 18 once, 24 once, and 17 once. Oh, so each number occurs exactly once. 

Wait, but the definition of mode is the number that appears more frequently than others. If all numbers appear the same number of times, then technically, there is no mode because none of them stand out as the most frequent. But sometimes, people might consider all numbers as modes if they're equally frequent, but in that case, it's called multimodal. However, in many cases, especially in basic statistics, if all elements are equally frequent, the data set is said to have no mode.

Looking at the options provided, option A is "no mode." That must be the correct answer because none of the numbers repeat. So, the mode doesn't exist here.

The mode is the value that appears most frequently. In the given sample, all numbers appear exactly once, so there is no mode.

Answer: A
