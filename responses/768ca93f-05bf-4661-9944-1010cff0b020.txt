Okay, so I've got this question about trees in graph theory. The question is asking how many distinct directed trees can be constructed from an undirected tree with 100 nodes. Hmm, I remember that trees are connected acyclic graphs, and when they're undirected, they have no direction on their edges. But when you make them directed, you assign a direction to each edge.

Wait, so the question is about taking an undirected tree and turning it into a directed tree. I think a directed tree, or a directed graph, has edges with specific directions. But wait, in trees, there's a root, right? So for a directed tree, one node is the root, and all edges point away from it. Or wait, no, sometimes edges can point in any direction, but there's a single root and a parent-child structure.

Wait, no, maybe I should think about it differently. An undirected tree can be converted into a directed tree by choosing a root and orienting all edges away from the root. But wait, the question is about how many distinct directed trees can be made from one undirected tree. So each possible root would give a different directed tree, right? Because the direction of the edges depends on the root.

Wait, no, that's not right. Because when you choose a root, you assign directions based on that root, but the same undirected tree can have multiple directed versions based on different roots. So for each undirected tree, the number of directed trees is equal to the number of possible roots, which is equal to the number of nodes. Because each node can be the root, and from each root, you direct the edges accordingly.

Wait, but wait a second. If the undirected tree has n nodes, then the number of possible directed trees would be n times the number of possible root assignments, but actually, each root gives exactly one directed tree. Because once you pick a root, the direction of the edges is uniquely determined as away from the root towards the children. So for each node as root, you get a unique directed tree.

So for an undirected tree with n nodes, the number of distinct directed trees is n. Because each node can be the root, leading to a different directed tree where edges point away from the root.

Wait, but that seems too simple. Let me think again. Suppose I have a simple tree with 3 nodes: A connected to B, and A connected to C. The undirected tree can be directed in two ways based on choosing A as root, B as root, or C as root.

Wait, no, if A is the root, then the edges are A→B and A→C. If B is the root, then the edges would be B→A and A→C, because from B's perspective, A is the parent, and C is a child of A. Similarly, if C is the root, edges are C→A and A→B. So each choice of root gives a different directed tree. So for n=3, the number of directed trees is 3.

Wait, but in that case, the number is n, which is 3. But wait, the options given for the question with n=100 don't include 100 as the answer. Wait, looking back, the options are A:9900, B:10000, C:250, D:1000, E:150, F:99, G:50, H:500, I:200, J:100.

So option J is 100, which would fit if the answer is n=100, but I'm not sure if that's correct.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. The question says, "How many distinct directed trees can be constructed from an undirected tree with 100 nodes?" So perhaps it's considering all possible orientations of the edges, not just those with a single root.

Wait, no, in a directed tree, I think it's an arborescence, meaning all edges are directed away from a single root. So for each undirected tree, the number of directed trees is equal to the number of possible roots, which is n. So for 100 nodes, it's 100.

But wait another thought: in an undirected tree, each edge can be directed in two ways. So for a tree with m edges, the total number of possible directed versions would be 2^m. But wait, that would be if each edge can be directed independently. But in a tree, the structure matters because it's connected and acyclic.

Wait no, that's not correct because the question is about directed trees, which are more structured. A directed tree (or arborescence) requires that all edges are directed away from a single root. So each arborescence corresponds to choosing a root and directing all edges away from it. So the number of arborescences is equal to the number of possible roots, which is n.

So for n=100, the answer would be 100, which is option J.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because previously I thought that each edge's direction is determined by the root, but perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again.

In an undirected tree, each edge is between two nodes. When you choose a root, say node R, then for each edge, the direction is determined as from the parent to the child. So each edge's direction is fixed once the root is chosen. Therefore, each root choice leads to exactly one directed tree, and each directed tree corresponds to exactly one root.

So the number of directed trees is equal to the number of possible roots, which is n. So for n=100, the answer is 100, which is option J.

The question asks how many distinct directed trees can be constructed from an undirected tree with 100 nodes. A directed tree, or arborescence, requires all edges to be directed away from a single root. For each undirected tree, the number of possible directed trees is equal to the number of nodes, as each node can serve as the root, leading to a unique directed tree. Therefore, for 100 nodes, the number of distinct directed trees is 100.

Answer: J
