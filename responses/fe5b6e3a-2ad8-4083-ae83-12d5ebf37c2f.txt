The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

Owner has a property in fee simple absolute. He executes a deed to Friend with the words "To Friend for life and then to the heirs of Owner." Under common law principles the conveyance to the heirs is not effective. Thus, the deed would result in a life estate to Friend with a reversion back to Owner. That result is due to what common law doctrine?

Options:

A: The doctrine of eminent domain
B: The rule of survivorship
C: The rule of destructibility of contingent remainders
D: The rule in Shelly's case
E: The doctrine of escheat
F: The doctrine of concurrent ownership
G: The doctrine of worthier title
H: The rule of lapse
I: The rule against perpetuities
J: The doctrine of adverse possession

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about property law, specifically dealing with common law doctrines related to deeds and estates. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question says that an owner has a property in fee simple absolute. He executes a deed to his Friend with the words "To Friend for life and then to the heirs of Owner." Under common law, the conveyance to the heirs isn't effective, so the deed results in a life estate to Friend with a reversion back to the Owner. The question is asking which common law doctrine causes this result.

First, I need to understand what each part of the deed means. The grant is "To Friend for life," which clearly creates a life estate because it's limited to Friend's life. The next part is "then to the heirs of Owner." So after Friend's life estate ends, it's supposed to go to Owner's heirs. But the question states that under common law, this part doesn't work as intended, so the Owner gets a reversion instead.

I remember that in property law, when someone conveys a life estate and then tries to create another estate, certain rules can affect whether that subsequent estate is valid. One key concept is the idea of a reversion versus a remainder. A reversion occurs when the grantor retains the future interest, while a remainder is when the future interest is given to someone else.

In this case, the owner is the grantor. He's trying to give a life estate to Friend and then a remainder to his own heirs. But why isn't that remainder valid?

I think about the common law rule that if a grantor creates a life estate and then tries to convey a remainder to their own heirs, that conveyance might not be effective. Because the grantor still has a reversion unless they effectively transfer the future interest. So, if the grantor doesn't have the authority to transfer the remainder because it's still theirs, the future interest doesn't pass.

Wait, but isn't that where the concept of the "rule of worthier title" comes into play? Or maybe it's the "rule against contingent remainders" or something else. Let me think about each option.

Looking at the options:

A: Eminent domain – that's about government taking property, not relevant here.

B: Rule of survivorship – that's more about joint tenancy, not relevant.

C: Rule of destructibility of contingent remainders – I think this relates to the idea that some future interests are destroyed if they're too remote or contingent, but I'm not sure.

D: Rule in Shelly's case – I remember this deals with the transfer of a remainder. In Shelly's case, the court held that a grantor could not transfer a remainder to their own heirs because it was considered a better title for the grantor to retain. So if the grantor creates a life estate and then tries to convey the remainder to their own heirs, the remainder is invalid, leaving the grantor with a reversion.

E: Escheat – that's when property goes to the state due to lack of heirs, not relevant here.

F: Concurrent ownership – about multiple owners, not relevant.

G: Doctrine of worthier title – this also sounds familiar. I think it's another name for the same principle as in Shelly's case. The idea is that the grantor's own heirs are a "worthier" class, so the grantor can't transfer a remainder to their own heirs unless they have a prior estate.

Wait, so the rule in Shelly's case and the doctrine of worthier title might be the same thing. Let me clarify. Shelly's case established that a grantor could not transfer a remainder to their own heirs because it was considered a better title for the grantor. So the grantor couldn't give a remainder to their own heirs; instead, they retained the reversion. This is sometimes referred to as the "rule of the worthier title."

So in this question, the owner (grantor) tried to give a life estate to Friend and then to their own heirs. Under the rule, that's invalid, so the heirs don't get anything, and the Owner gets the reversion.

Looking back at the options, D is the rule in Shelly's case, and G is the doctrine of worthier title. Are these the same or different? I think they are related but distinct. Shelly's case is the specific rule, and the doctrine of worthier title is the broader principle.

Wait, the question says the conveyance to the heirs is not effective, so the deed creates a life estate with a reversion. The reason is that the grantor can't transfer a remainder to their own heirs. So the correct doctrine is either D or G.

I think the answer is G: the doctrine of worthier title, but I'm a bit confused because I remember Shelly's case being a specific example of this principle. Alternatively, the rule in Shelly's case is a specific application of the doctrine.

Wait, I think I might have mixed up the terms. The rule in Shelly's case is part of the doctrine of worthier title. So the doctrine is the broader concept, and the rule is a specific application. So the question is asking for the doctrine, which would be G: the doctrine of worthier title.

But wait, another thought: the rule in Shelly's case specifically says that a grantor cannot transfer a remainder to their own heirs if the grantor has a prior interest. So if the grantor conveys a life estate to A and then to the grantor's heirs, the grantor's heirs can't take because the grantor still has a reversion. This is known as the rule in Shelly's case, which is part of the doctrine of worthier title.

So the options are D and G. Which one is the correct answer? Let me check.

The question says the conveyance to the heirs is not effective because of a common law doctrine. So the correct answer is either D or G.

I think the rule in Shelly's case is the specific rule, and the doctrine is the broader principle. So the answer is D: the rule in Shelly's case.

Wait, but in the options, D is the rule in Shelly's case, and G is the doctrine of worthier title. I think the doctrine of worthier title is the same as the rule in Shelly's case. Some sources say that the rule in Shelly's case is the same as the doctrine of worthier title.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of it this way: when a grantor conveys a life estate and then tries to convey the remainder to their own heirs, the remainder is invalid because the grantor's heirs are a "worthier" class. This is the doctrine of worthier title. The rule in Shelly's case is a specific example of this doctrine.

So the question is asking for the doctrine, which is G: the doctrine of worthier title.

Wait, but I'm not 100% sure. Another approach: the rule in Shelly's case holds that a grantor cannot create a remainder in their own heirs if they have a prior interest in the property. That prior interest is the reversion. So the grantor's attempt to convey the remainder to their heirs fails, leaving them with a reversion.

In the given deed, the owner (grantor) conveys a life estate to Friend and then to the heirs of the owner. Since the grantor still has a reversion, the remainder to the heirs is invalid under the rule in Shelly's case, which is an application of the doctrine of worthier title.

So the answer is either D or G. I think the correct answer is G: the doctrine of worthier title because the question is asking about the doctrine, not the specific rule from Shelly's case.

Wait, but some sources say that the rule in Shelly's case is the same as the doctrine of worthier title. So perhaps the answer is D.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is G. I'm a bit torn here.

Wait, looking at the options again:

D: The rule in Shelly's case

G: The doctrine of worthier title

I think the rule in Shelly's case is the specific rule that a grantor cannot transfer a remainder to their own heirs if they themselves have a reversion. So the correct answer is D.

Wait, but I've also heard that the doctrine of worthier title is another name for the same principle. So perhaps both D and G are correct, but that's unlikely.

I think the correct answer is D: the rule in Shelly's case.

The question involves a deed where the grantor conveys a life estate to Friend and then to the grantor's heirs. Under common law, this conveyance to the heirs is ineffective, resulting in a life estate to Friend and a reversion to the grantor. The reason for this outcome is rooted in the principle that a grantor cannot transfer a remainder to their own heirs if they retain a prior interest (a reversion). This principle is known as the rule in Shelly's case, which prevents the grantor from transferring a remainder to their own heirs, as the grantor's interest is considered a "worthier" title. Therefore, the correct answer is the rule in Shelly's case.

Answer: D
