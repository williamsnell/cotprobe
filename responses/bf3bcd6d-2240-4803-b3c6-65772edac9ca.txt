Okay, so I'm trying to answer this economics question about supply and demand. The question says that both the demand for grapes increases and the supply of grapes increases at the same time. I need to figure out what happens to the equilibrium quantity and the price.

Let me start by recalling what I know about supply and demand. The equilibrium price and quantity are where the supply and demand curves intersect. If demand increases, the demand curve shifts to the right, which should lead to a higher equilibrium price and a higher quantity. On the other hand, if supply increases, the supply curve shifts to the right, which would lower the equilibrium price but increase the quantity.

Wait, but in this case, both are happening simultaneously. So demand is up, supply is up. The equilibrium quantity must be affected by both. When both curves shift right, the quantity definitely goes up because both buyers and sellers are willing to do more at some point. But what about the price?

When demand increases, it tends to raise the price. But when supply increases, it tends to lower the price. So the price effect is ambiguous because it depends on which shift is stronger. If the demand shift is bigger, price goes up. If supply is bigger, price goes down. If they're equal, price stays the same. But since the question doesn't specify the magnitude, we can't know for sure whether the price goes up, down, or stays the same.

So, equilibrium quantity definitely rises because both shifts lead to more quantity. But the price change is uncertain because it's a tug of war between demand increasing (pushing price up) and supply increasing (pushing price down). So the price could go up, down, or maybe even stay the same, depending on which effect is stronger.

Looking at the options, I need to find the one where equilibrium quantity rises and the price change is ambiguous. Let's check the options:

A: Both up. No, because price isn't necessarily up.

B: Quantity up, price ambiguous. Yes, this fits.

C: Quantity same, price up. No, because quantity does rise.

D: Quantity down, price up. No, quantity goes up.

E: Quantity same, price up. No.

F: Both same. No.

G: Quantity down, price down. No.

H: Quantity up, price down. No, because price might not go down; it's unclear.

I: Quantity same, price down. No.

J: Quantity down, ambiguous price. No, quantity up.

So the correct answer must be B: equilibrium quantity rises, but the price change is ambiguous.

When both demand and supply increase simultaneously, the equilibrium quantity definitely rises because both shifts lead to a higher quantity. However, the price change is ambiguous because the increase in demand tends to raise the price, while the increase in supply tends to lower it. Without knowing the relative magnitudes of the shifts, the price could rise, fall, or remain the same.

B: equilibrium quantity rises, but the price change is ambiguous.

Answer: B
