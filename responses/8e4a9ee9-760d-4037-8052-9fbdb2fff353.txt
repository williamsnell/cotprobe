Alright, so I have this question about pandemics caused by influenza viruses and which animals they come from. I'm a bit rusty on my virology, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that influenza, or the flu, is a virus that can affect various animals. The main ones I've heard about are birds, pigs, and humans. I think wild birds are a big reservoir for the flu. They carry a lot of different strains without getting sick themselves. So when birds migrate, they can spread these viruses to other animals, including humans and pigs.

Influenza A viruses are known to circulate in birds, especially wild waterfowl. These birds can pass the virus to domesticated birds like chickens, which might then come into contact with humans. The H5N1 bird flu is a classic example that's caused significant concern.

Then there are swine flu cases, like the H1N1 pandemic in 2009, which originated in pigs. Pigs can be a mixing vessel for different flu strains because they can be infected by both avian and human flu viruses. This mixing can create new strains that might jump back to humans.

Looking at the options, wild birds (A) and pigs (G) are both possibilities. But the question asks about the most common source of pandemics. I think wild birds are the primary source because they're the natural reservoir. Pandemics often start with bird flu strains that mutate or reassort to become transmissible to humans.

Wait, but the 2009 H1N1 was from pigs. So which is more common? Maybe the majority of pandemics come from birds, but pigs can also be a source. I'm trying to recall other examples. The 1918 flu, which was H1N1, is thought to have come from birds as well, possibly through pigs. 

Another angle: the initial hosts. Wild birds are the original hosts. Then the virus can jump to domesticated birds, pigs, and then humans. So for pandemics, the primary animal source is wild birds. They're the main reservoir, so most pandemics would originate from there.

So the answer should be A: Wild birds.

The most common source of influenza viruses that lead to pandemics is wild birds, as they serve as a natural reservoir for many strains of the virus. These birds can spread the virus to other animals, including humans, through migration and contact. Therefore, the answer is:

A

Answer: A
