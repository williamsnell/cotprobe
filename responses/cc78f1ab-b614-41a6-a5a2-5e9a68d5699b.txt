Answer the following multiple choice question, selecting from the answer A through to J. After thinking, reply directly with your answer. 

The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

This question refers to the following information.
"With 78 percent of the Union electorate casting ballots, Lincoln was reelected in an Electoral College landslide, 212 to McClellan's 21. The 55% popular vote for the president was the third largest in the nineteenth century, surpassed only by Jackson's first victory in 1828 and Grant's reelection in 1872. McClellan won only New Jersey, Delaware, and Kentucky. Republicans drew support from native-born farmers, skilled and professional workers, those of New England descent, younger voters, and military personnel. Democrats were strongest in the cities and among Irish- and German-Americans (the most populous immigrant groups). It has been estimated that Lincoln received 78% of the vote of Union soldiers and sailors. The figure was not necessary for his reelection, but was perhaps the margin of victory in a few close states and, more importantly, of great symbolic value. Republicans also gained seats in Congress to retain unassailable control, 149 to 42 in the House and 42 to 10 in the Senate; took back several state legislatures; and lost only the governorship of New Jersey (McClellan's home state)."

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about why Radical Republicans opposed Lincoln in 1861. I'm a bit rusty on my history, but I'll try to think it through. Let me start by recalling who the Radical Republicans were. I remember they were a faction within the Republican Party during the Civil War era. They were known for being more extreme in their views, especially regarding the abolition of slavery and Reconstruction.

The question is asking about their opposition to Lincoln in 1861. Wait, 1861 was the year the Civil War started. Lincoln was President then, and the Radical Republicans were part of his party. So why would they oppose him? Maybe it's about their differing policies or approaches.

Looking at the options:

A: Lincoln's decision to issue the Emancipation Proclamation without congressional oversight. I think the Emancipation Proclamation was in 1863, not 1861, so this might not be the right time frame. Plus, I'm not sure if the Radicals opposed it because of lack of congressional oversight or the content.

B: Lincoln's handling of the Civil War. Hmm, I think the Radicals were critical of Lincoln's approach early on, maybe feeling he wasn't aggressive enough in prosecuting the war. They wanted a more proactive approach to defeating the Confederacy.

C: Lincoln's stance on expanding the Union aggressively. Wait, the Union's expansion isn't the main issue here. The Civil War was about states' rights and slavery, so maybe not about expansion.

D: Radicals wanted immediate emancipation, Lincoln refused. That sounds plausible. The Radicals were more abolitionist and wanted immediate freedom for slaves, while Lincoln might have been more cautious, perhaps wanting to end slavery but through more gradual means. But I'm not sure if this was the main issue in 1861.

E: Suspending habeas corpus. Lincoln did suspend habeas corpus early in the war, which was controversial. Some thought it was a power grab, but were the Radicals against this? I'm not certain; I think some Radicals might have supported strong measures against the Confederacy.

F: Andrew Johnson as VP. That's more about later years, like after the war when Johnson was President. This option might relate more to post-war Reconstruction issues, not 1861.

G: Lincoln too sympathetic to the Confederacy. That seems off. Lincoln was the Union president; he wanted to preserve the Union and was against secession, so being sympathetic to the Confederacy doesn't fit.

H: Lincoln didn't impose harsh punishments on the South. Maybe the Radicals wanted to punish the South more after the war, but in 1861, the war was just starting, so this might not be the issue.

I: Lincoln's plan for reintegration of the South. Again, this seems more post-war. Reintegration would be part of Reconstruction, which came after the war ended in 1865.

J: Ten Percent Plan and black suffrage. The Ten Percent Plan was Lincoln's idea for Reconstruction, allowing states to rejoin if 10% of their voters took an oath of allegiance. It didn't include black suffrage, which the Radicals wanted. But this was in 1863 or 1864, not 1861.

Wait, the question is about 1861. So maybe the issue was their differing strategies regarding the Civil War. The Radicals wanted a more aggressive approach to end the war quickly and abolish slavery. Lincoln was more cautious, perhaps focusing on preserving the Union first and then dealing with slavery.

Looking back at the options, B says the Radicals disapproved of Lincoln's handling of the Civil War. That makes sense because Radicals wanted a more aggressive prosecution of the war, maybe even a shorter approach, while Lincoln was trying to balance various interests and perhaps was seen as not being tough enough.

Another angle: the Emancipation Proclamation was in 1863, so that's not relevant for 1861. However, before the war, Radical Republicans wanted immediate action against slavery. But in 1861, the war had just started, so their opposition might have been about Lincoln's war policies rather than slavery.

Wait, but the question is about why they opposed Lincoln in 1861. So it's about his policies around that time. The Radical Republicans were critical of Lincoln's approach to the war, perhaps feeling he wasn't doing enough to win or was too cautious.

So option B seems the best fit.

The Radical Republicans opposed Lincoln in 1861 primarily due to their dissatisfaction with his handling of the Civil War. They wanted a more aggressive approach to quickly end the war and abolish slavery, whereas Lincoln was seen as cautious and not proactive enough in prosecuting the conflict. This aligns with option B, which highlights their disapproval of Lincoln's management of the war effort.

Answer: B
