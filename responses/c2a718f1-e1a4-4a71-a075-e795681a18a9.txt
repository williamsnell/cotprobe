Question:

A load of 7.5 tons is to be lifted from a depth of 760 ft. using a wire rope. It is suggested to use a widely applied 6 × 19 IPS rope of diameter 1(1/2) in. and drum of diameter 96 in. Check if these sizes are suitable.

Options:

A: Both the rope and the drum sizes are not acceptable
B: Both the rope and the drum sizes are acceptable, but the rope material needs to be upgraded
C: The size of the drum is not acceptable
D: Both the rope and the drum sizes are acceptable, but the drum material needs to be upgraded
E: The size of the rope is acceptable, but the drum should be larger than 96 inches in diameter
F: The size of the rope is not acceptable
G: The size of the rope is acceptable, but the drum should be smaller than 96 inches in diameter
H: The size of the drum is acceptable, but the rope should be thinner than 1(1/2) inches in diameter
I: The size of the rope and the drum are acceptable
J: The size of the drum is acceptable, but the rope should be thicker than 1(1/2) inches in diameter

Okay, so I have this question about lifting a load using a wire rope and a drum. Let me try to figure out the right answer step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll think it through.

The problem states that a load of 7.5 tons needs to be lifted from a depth of 760 feet. They're suggesting using a 6 × 19 IPS wire rope with a diameter of 1.5 inches, and a drum with a diameter of 96 inches. I need to check if these sizes are suitable.

First, I should probably consider the wire rope's strength. I remember that wire ropes have different grades, like IPS (Improved Plow Steel), which is commonly used. The 6 × 19 construction means it has 6 strands, each with 19 wires. The diameter is 1.5 inches.

I think I need to calculate the breaking strength of the rope. The formula for breaking strength is roughly the cross-sectional area multiplied by the yield strength. The yield strength for IPS is about 170,000 psi. 

The cross-sectional area (A) of the rope can be calculated using the formula for the area of a circle: A = πr². The diameter is 1.5 inches, so the radius is 0.75 inches. 

Calculating that: A = π * (0.75)^2 ≈ 3.1416 * 0.5625 ≈ 1.767 square inches.

Now, the breaking strength (S) would be S = A * Y, where Y is the yield strength. So S ≈ 1.767 * 170,000 ≈ 299,390 pounds.

Wait, but that seems way too high. Maybe I made a mistake. Or perhaps I should consider the safety factor. Typically, a safety factor of 3-5 is used. Let's say 5 for a conservative approach. So the actual working load limit (WL) would be S / 5 ≈ 299,390 / 5 ≈ 59,878 pounds.

Wait, that's around 29.9 tons. The load is 7.5 tons, which is much less than 29.9 tons. So the rope's strength seems sufficient. But maybe I should double-check. Oh, wait, the 6 × 19 rope is often used for medium lifts, so 1.5 inches seems okay.

Next, considering the drum size. The drum diameter is 96 inches. The wire rope needs to wrap around the drum without kinking or overlapping too much. The general rule is that the drum diameter should be at least 12 times the rope diameter. So 12 * 1.5 = 18 inches. But wait, the drum is 96 inches, which is way bigger than 18 inches. So that's more than sufficient. But maybe there's another consideration, like the number of wraps or the length of the rope.

Wait, the load is at 760 ft deep. So the length of the rope needed is 760 feet. Let me check how much rope the drum can hold. The circumference of the drum is π * D = π * 96 inches ≈ 301.59 inches per revolution. Since 1 foot is 12 inches, 760 feet is 9120 inches. So the number of turns needed is 9120 / 301.59 ≈ 30.24 turns. That means the rope would wrap around the drum about 30 times. 

I think that's manageable. If the drum were too small, you might get too many turns, causing the rope to get tightly wound and possibly causing issues with kinking or friction. But since the drum is 96 inches, which is much larger than the minimum required, it should handle the 760 feet without problem.

Wait, but another thought: sometimes the drum needs to have a certain length of rope on it for safe operation. Maybe the drum's capacity is based on its diameter and the rope's diameter. But since the drum is so much larger, it's definitely suitable.

So, putting it together: the rope's breaking strength is more than enough for the load, and the drum size is way beyond the minimum required. So both are acceptable. 

Looking back at the options, option I says both are acceptable. But wait, let me check if there's any reason why they wouldn't be. Maybe the drum's size is too big, but I don't think that's an issue. Or perhaps the rope's diameter is too small? No, because the strength is sufficient.

Wait, another angle: sometimes the number of wraps affects the rope's life. But 30 wraps on a 96-inch drum with a 1.5-inch rope seems okay. So I think the answer is that both are acceptable. So the correct option is I.

The wire rope has a sufficient breaking strength to handle the 7.5-ton load, and the drum's diameter is more than adequate for the required length and number of wraps. Both sizes are acceptable.
