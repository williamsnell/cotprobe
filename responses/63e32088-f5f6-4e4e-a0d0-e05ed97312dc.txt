Question:

In 1993, a rancher had good record title to a 20-acre orange grove in fee simple absolute. In 1994, the rancher delivered to his son, for a sum of $1,000, a deed signed by the rancher, naming the son and his heirs as grantee, and appearing valid on its face. The son neglected to record the deed. In 1998, a farmer, aware of the existence of the rancher-to-son deed, sought out the rancher and asked to buy for $10,000 a deed to the orange grove from the rancher to the fanner and his heirs. The rancher executed such a deed, and the fanner promptly recorded it. The farmer's intent was to acquire color of title and obtain ownership of the orange grove by adverse possession. In 1998, the farmer constructed a fence around the orange grove. In 1999, the son presented his deed of the orange grove to a retiree, and for $15,000, paid by the retiree, signed and delivered a deed of the orange grove in favor of the retiree and his heirs. After receiving the deed, the retiree made no effort to search the title, to examine the property, or to record the deed. In 2003, a buyer paid the fanner $20,000, and the farmer delivered to the buyer a deed of the orange grove in favor of the buyer and his heirs. The buyer had examined the property, had searched the title, and had no knowledge of the farmer's awareness of the prior rancher-to-son instrument. Although the buyer did not reside on the property, he regularly visited the orange grove twice a week. The buyer recorded his deed. In 2007 for $25,000 paid by an orange grower, the retiree signed and delivered adeed of the orange grove naming the orange grower and his heirs as grantees. Before the grower had paid the retiree and taken his deed, the grower visited the orange grove and observed the fence. However, the buyer was not present when the grower visited the property and nothing suggested who if anyone was using it. In any case, the grower did not attempt to search the title before making his purchase. This jurisdiction uses Grantor Grantee Indices and has no Tract Index. In 2008, what is the present state of title to the orange grove if the jurisdiction's recording act provides: "Every conveyance of real property shall be invalid as against any person, except the grantor, his heirs, and assigns, having actual notice thereof, unless it is recorded as provided by statute"?

Options:

A: In a notice jurisdiction, the grower, as a subsequent bonafide purchaser, is only chargeable with notice of what appears in his chain of title and, therefore, would acquire record title to the orange grove.
B: In a race notice jurisdiction, the farmer would acquire equitable title to the orange grove, because he erected the fence and failed to inform the buyer of the prior rancher-to-son instrument.
C: In a race-notice jurisdiction, the farmer, having recorded his deed first, would acquire record title to the orange grove.
D: In a race-notice jurisdiction, the grower, being the last to record, would acquire record title to the orange grove.
E: In a notice jurisdiction, the retiree would acquire record title to the orange grove even though he failed to record his deed.
F: In a race-notice jurisdiction, the son would acquire record title to the orange grove, because he is the original grantee.
G: In a race jurisdiction, the buyer, having recorded his deed before the grower, would acquire record title to the orange grove.
H: In a notice jurisdiction, the retiree, despite not recording his deed, would acquire equitable title to the orange grove due to his payment and receipt of the deed.
I: In a notice jurisdiction, the rancher retains record title to the orange grove, as he never properly conveyed his title.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about property law, specifically dealing with recording acts and who has the valid title to an orange grove. It's a bit complex, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

First, let me read through the scenario again to make sure I understand the timeline and the key events.

In 1993, a rancher has good record title to a 20-acre orange grove in fee simple absolute. So he owns it outright, and his title is clear.

In 1994, the rancher gives his son a deed, for $1,000. The deed names the son and his heirs as grantee, and it's valid on its face. However, the son doesn't record it. So, the rancher still holds the record title because the son hasn't recorded the deed.

Then, in 1998, a farmer approaches the rancher wanting to buy the grove. The farmer knows about the rancher-to-son deed. The rancher sells the grove to the farmer for $10,000 and gives him a deed. The farmer records this deed promptly. The farmer's goal is to get color of title and then take ownership through adverse possession. So, the farmer records first, but the son hasn't recorded his deed yet.

In 1999, the son gives his deed to a retiree for $15,000. The retiree doesn't record the deed either. So now, the son's deed is with the retiree, but it's not on record.

In 2003, the farmer sells the orange grove to a buyer for $20,000. The buyer checks the title, didn't know about the rancher-to-son deed, and records his deed. The buyer regularly visits the grove but doesn't live there.

In 2007, the retiree sells the grove to an orange grower for $25,000. The grower pays, gets the deed, but before he pays, he visits the grove and sees the fence. He doesn't search the title before buying. The buyer wasn't there when the grower visited, so the grower doesn't know about the buyer's presence.

Now, the question is in 2008, who has the record title, given that the jurisdiction uses a Grantor-Grantee Index and has no Tract Index. The recording act is a race-notice jurisdiction, which I remember means that a subsequent bona fide purchaser (BFP) who records first and without notice of prior conveyances takes priority.

Let me outline the key points:

1. 1994: Rancher to Son (Deed not recorded)
2. 1998: Rancher to Farmer (Deed recorded)
3. 1999: Son to Retiree (Deed not recorded)
4. 2003: Farmer to Buyer (Deed recorded)
5. 2007: Retiree to Grower (Deed not recorded)

Wait, no, in 2007, the retiree delivers the deed to the grower, but the grower hasn't paid yet? Or did the grower pay and take the deed? The question says, "for $25,000 paid by an orange grower, the retiree signed and delivered a deed." So the grower paid and received the deed, but did he record it? It says before the grower paid and took the deed, he visited and saw the fence, but the buyer wasn't there. The grower didn't search the title.

So, the chain of title as per recording:

- 1998: Farmer records his deed from rancher.
- 2003: Buyer records his deed from farmer.
- 2007: Grower gets the deed from retiree but doesn't record it.

Wait, but the first conveyance from rancher to son was not recorded. Then rancher to farmer was recorded. Son to retiree wasn't recorded. Retiree to grower wasn't recorded either.

In a race-notice jurisdiction, the priority goes to the first to record, provided they are a BFP without notice.

Let's see who has priority:

The rancher conveyed to the son in 1994, but the son didn't record. Then, in 1998, the rancher conveys to the farmer, who records immediately. Farmer's recording in 1998 would give him record title because he was a BFP, as he had actual notice? Wait, the farmer was aware of the rancher-to-son deed. The question says the farmer was aware of the rancher-to-son deed when he approached the rancher. So the farmer had actual notice of a prior unrecorded deed.

In a race-notice jurisdiction, a subsequent purchaser must both record first and be a BFP (no notice). So if the farmer had actual notice, he wouldn't be a BFP. Therefore, the rancher's deed to the son, even though unrecorded, would take priority over the farmer's deed because the farmer had notice and didn't record first.

Wait, but the son didn't record his deed either. So the rancher's deed to the son was in 1994, unrecorded. Then, in 1998, the rancher conveys to the farmer, who records. The farmer had actual notice of the prior deed, so he's not a BFP. Therefore, the son's unrecorded deed would take priority over the farmer's recorded deed because the farmer had notice.

Then, in 1999, the son conveys to the retiree, but the retiree doesn't record. So the title is still in the son's name as far as records are concerned.

In 2003, the farmer conveys to the buyer, who records. But the buyer had no knowledge of the rancher-to-son deed. The buyer only knew about the farmer's deed because he searched the title. Since the rancher-to-son deed wasn't recorded, the buyer didn't have notice of it. So would the buyer be a BFP?

Wait, in a race-notice jurisdiction, the BFP must record first and have no notice. The buyer recorded in 2003. The prior conveyance to the son was in 1994, unrecorded. The farmer (from 1998) had notice, so his conveyance to the buyer wouldn't affect the son's prior unrecorded deed.

So the buyer would have title from the farmer, but the son's deed is prior. But because the son didn't record, and the buyer didn't have notice, does the buyer take priority?

Wait, no, because the son's deed was prior but unrecorded. In a race-notice, if the prior deed holder (son) doesn't record, and the subsequent BFP (buyer) records, the subsequent BFP takes priority.

Wait, no. The prior conveyance is the son's deed in 1994. The farmer's deed in 1998 is after that, but the farmer had actual notice, so he can't take priority. The buyer comes after the farmer, but the buyer didn't have notice of the son's deed because it wasn't recorded.

So the buyer's recording in 2003 would take priority over any subsequent unrecorded deeds, but the prior unrecorded deed (son's) would still be effective against the buyer unless the buyer is a BFP.

Wait, no. Let me think again.

In a race-notice jurisdiction, a subsequent BFP who records first without notice of prior unrecorded conveyances takes priority.

Here's the chain:

1. 1994: Rancher to Son (unrecorded)
2. 1998: Rancher to Farmer (recorded)
3. 1999: Son to Retiree (unrecorded)
4. 2003: Farmer to Buyer (recorded)
5. 2007: Retiree to Grower (unrecorded)

The key is determining who is a BFP and who records first.

The rancher conveyed to the son in 1994. The son didn't record. Then, in 1998, the rancher conveys to the farmer, who records. But the farmer had actual notice of the son's deed, so he's not a BFP. Therefore, the farmer's recording doesn't take priority over the son's prior unrecorded deed.

Then, in 1999, the son conveys to the retiree, who also doesn't record. So the chain remains with the son.

In 2003, the farmer conveys to the buyer, who records. The buyer, when purchasing, had no knowledge of the rancher-to-son deed because it wasn't recorded. So the buyer is a BFP. He records his deed in 2003.

In 2007, the retiree conveys to the grower, who doesn't record.

Now, when the grower buys from the retiree in 2007, he didn't search the title, so he didn't know about the prior deeds. But the question is about the recording act: in a race-notice jurisdiction, the priority is given to the first to record as a BFP.

So, the buyer recorded in 2003, which is before the grower's conveyance. The grower didn't record, so the buyer's record would take priority.

But wait, the buyer's title comes from the farmer, who had a deed that was later than the son's unrecorded deed. But since the farmer had notice, the buyer's title is from a grantor (farmer) who had notice, but the buyer himself didn't have notice because he searched and didn't find the prior deed.

In a race-notice jurisdiction, the buyer would be a BFP if he recorded first and had no notice. So the buyer's recording in 2003 would give him record title, even though the prior deed to the son existed but was unrecorded.

So, the grower, who didn't record, would not have priority over the buyer. The buyer recorded first, so he's the one with record title.

Looking at the options:

A: Notice jurisdiction, BFP with notice from chain of title. But the jurisdiction is race-notice.

B: Farmer gets equitable title. Not sure.

C: Farmer records first, so gets record title. But farmer had notice, so he shouldn't be BFP.

D: Grower records last, so gets title. But he didn't record.

G: Buyer recorded before grower, so in race-notice, buyer gets title.

So the correct answer would be G: In a race jurisdiction, the buyer, having recorded his deed before the grower, would acquire record title to the orange grove.

Wait, but the options are about race-notice. Option G says "race jurisdiction," but the question specifies a race-notice jurisdiction.

Looking again:

Option C: In a race-notice jurisdiction, the farmer, having recorded his deed first, would acquire record title.

But the farmer had actual notice, so he's not a BFP. So he wouldn't take priority over the son's prior unrecorded deed.

Option D: In a race-notice, the grower, last to record, would get title. But the grower didn't record.

Option G is about race jurisdiction, but the question is race-notice. So perhaps the correct option is G, but in the given options, it's labeled as race jurisdiction, not race-notice.

Wait, the options are:

A: Notice jurisdiction...

B: Race-notice, farmer...

C: Race-notice, farmer...

D: Race-notice, grower...

E: Notice, retiree...

F: Race-notice, son...

G: Race, buyer...

H: Notice, retiree...

I: Notice, rancher.

So the correct answer is in a race-notice jurisdiction, the buyer, having recorded before the grower, is a BFP without notice and thus takes priority.

But looking at the options, the only one that mentions the buyer is G, which says in a race jurisdiction. Since the question is about race-notice, but none of the options directly say that. So perhaps the correct answer is G, assuming it's a typo, but in reality, the jurisdiction is race-notice.

Wait, but in a race-notice jurisdiction, the buyer recorded first and was a BFP, so he gets title. The grower didn't record, so the buyer's title remains.

Therefore, the answer would be G, but since the option says "race jurisdiction," not "race-notice," but the question specifies race-notice, so perhaps none of the options are perfect, but the closest is G.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is C, but I think C is incorrect because the farmer had notice.

Wait, let me think again. The priority would be:

1. Son's deed (1994, unrecorded)
2. Farmer's deed (1998, recorded but with notice)
3. Buyer's deed (2003, recorded without notice)
4. Retiree's deed (1999, unrecorded)
5. Grower's deed (2007, unrecorded)

In race-notice, the first BFP to record without notice takes priority. The buyer is a BFP because he had no notice and recorded in 2003. The prior unrecorded deed to the son doesn't affect the buyer because the buyer didn't have notice. So the buyer's title is valid.

Therefore, the correct answer is G: In a race jurisdiction, the buyer, having recorded his deed before the grower, would acquire record title.

But the option says "race jurisdiction," while the question specifies race-notice. Maybe it's a mistake, but among the options, G is the closest.
</think>

The scenario involves a chain of deeds with varying recording statuses in a race-notice jurisdiction. The key is determining who qualifies as a bona fide purchaser (BFP) and who records first. The rancher conveyed the property to the son in 1994, but the son did not record. The farmer, aware of this deed, purchased and recorded in 1998, but since he had actual notice, he is not a BFP. The buyer, in 2003, purchased from the farmer, recorded the deed, and had no notice of the prior unrecorded deed, making him a BFP. The grower, in 2007, did not record his deed. In a race-notice jurisdiction, the buyer, as the first BFP to record, acquires record title. 

Answer: G
