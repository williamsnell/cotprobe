Okay, so I've got this problem about a water pump motor and figuring out the maximum depth of the well it can handle. Hmm, let me see. I'm a bit rusty on some of these formulas, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

Alright, the motor has a horsepower rating of 11.3 hp. It's supposed to pump water at a rate of 1 cubic foot per second. The water's weight density is 62.4 pounds per cubic foot. We need to find the maximum depth of the well, neglecting friction. So, I think this is a power and work problem.

Power, right, is the rate at which work is done. The formula I remember is Power (P) equals work (W) divided by time (t), so P = W/t. But here, we might need to relate it to the pumping of water.

Since the water is being pumped at 1 ft³/s, the volume flow rate (Q) is 1 ft³/s. The weight density (γ) is given as 62.4 lbs/ft³. So, the weight flow rate (which is like the mass flow rate in units with gravity included) would be γ times Q. That would be 62.4 lb/ft³ * 1 ft³/s = 62.4 lb/s. Wait, lb is a unit of force, so actually, that's the force per second, which makes sense.

Now, the pump is lifting this water to a certain height, h, which is the depth of the well we're trying to find. The work done per unit time (which is power) should equal the power output of the motor.

The work done per second (which is power) would be the force times the distance lifted, divided by time. But since the flow rate is per second, maybe it's simpler to think in terms of power being the force (weight per second) times the velocity (which here is the lifting speed). Wait, but in this case, the pump is moving the water up at a certain rate, but perhaps it's better to think in terms of how much energy is needed to lift the water each second.

Wait, maybe another approach. The power required to pump water is the product of the weight flow rate, the height lifted, and the gravitational acceleration. But since the weight density already includes gravity (because it's in pounds, which is a force), maybe the formula simplifies.

So, the power required (P) would be weight flow rate (q) multiplied by the height (h). So P = q * h.

But wait, let's double-check the units. Power in horsepower, weight flow rate in lb/s, height in feet. Let me see: 1 horsepower is equal to how many foot-pounds per second? I think 1 hp is approximately 550 ft-lbf/s. So, the power from the motor is 11.3 hp * 550 ft-lbf/s per hp. Let me calculate that.

11.3 hp * 550 ft-lbf/s = 11.3 * 550 = let's see, 10 * 550 is 5500, 1.3 * 550 is 715, so total is 5500 + 715 = 6215 ft-lbf/s. So P is 6215 ft-lbf/s.

Now, the power required is q * h, where q is the weight flow rate. q is 62.4 lb/s. So,

P = q * h → h = P / q.

Plugging in the numbers:

h = 6215 ft-lbf/s / 62.4 lb/s.

Let me compute that. 6215 divided by 62.4.

First, 62.4 times 100 is 6240, which is a bit more than 6215. So it's a bit less than 100. Let's see, 62.4 * 99 = 62.4*(100-1) = 6240 - 62.4 = 6177.6. Hmm, 6215 is 6215 - 6177.6 = 37.4 above that. So 99 + (37.4 / 62.4).

37.4 / 62.4 ≈ 0.599. So h ≈ 99.599 feet, which is approximately 99.6 feet. But wait, let's check the calculation more accurately.

Alternatively, 6215 ÷ 62.4: Let me compute it step by step.

62.4 * 99 = 6177.6 as above. 6215 - 6177.6 = 37.4.

37.4 / 62.4 = 0.599 approx. So total is 99.599, which is about 99.6 feet.

Looking at the options, the closest is option H: 120 ft, but wait, that's not close. Wait, maybe I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, no, 99.6 is about 100 feet, but none of the options have 100 except E: 100 ft. Wait, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, another thought: Power is also equal to the weight flow rate multiplied by the head (h) and the efficiency, but since the problem says to neglect friction, I think we can assume 100% efficiency, so no need to adjust for that. So the formula should still hold.

Wait, but perhaps I forgot to consider the gravitational acceleration? Because weight density is in lb/ft³, which is force per volume, so when you multiply by the volume, you get force (weight), and then lifting that against gravity requires energy. Wait, maybe I should have included the acceleration due to gravity (g), but in this case, since the weight density already includes the effect of gravity (because it's in pounds, which is a force), perhaps it's already accounted for.

Wait, let me think about the units again. The weight flow rate is in lb/s. Lifting that weight by h feet would require work per second of lb * ft, so the power is in lb·ft/s. But 1 horsepower is 550 ft-lbf/s, so the units are consistent.

Wait, but perhaps I should think of power as (weight flow rate) * (head) * g, but since weight density is already weight per volume, which is mass * g per volume, perhaps the g is included.

Alternatively, maybe the formula is Power = (mass flow rate) * g * head. But since we're dealing with weight (which is mass * g), the mass flow rate is weight flow rate divided by g. Hmm, perhaps I should check that.

Wait, mass flow rate (m_dot) is equal to weight flow rate (w_dot) divided by g, where g is acceleration due to gravity. So m_dot = w_dot / g.

Then, power P = m_dot * g * h = (w_dot / g) * g * h = w_dot * h. So that brings me back to the same formula, P = w_dot * h. So that's correct.

So, my earlier calculation of h ≈ 99.6 feet would be correct. But looking at the options, E is 100 ft, which is very close. But wait, the options don't include 100 except for E. So perhaps the answer is E: 100 ft.

Wait, but wait another moment. Let me recheck the calculation of 6215 / 62.4 exactly.

So 6215 ÷ 62.4.

Let me compute 62.4 * 99 = 6177.6. Subtract that from 6215: 6215 - 6177.6 = 37.4.

Now, 62.4 * 0.6 = 37.44. So 0.6 *62.4 =37.44. So 37.4 is very close to 37.44, so 0.6.

So h = 99 + 0.6 = 99.6 ft. So approximately 99.6 feet, which is about 100 feet. So the closest answer would be E: 100 ft.

But wait, let me check the options again. The options are:

A: 180 ft

B: 150 ft

C: 200 ft

D: 300 ft

E: 100 ft

F: 30 ft

G: 250 ft

H: 120 ft

I: 75 ft

J: 50 ft

So E is 100 ft, which is the closest. But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the initial calculation.

Wait, another thought: Did I correctly convert horsepower to ft-lbf/s? Let me confirm. 1 horsepower is indeed 550 ft-lbf per second. So yes, 11.3 hp * 550 = 6215 ft-lbf/s. That part seems correct.

Then, weight flow rate is 62.4 lb/s. So 6215 divided by 62.4 is 99.6 ft. So the maximum depth would be approximately 99.6 feet, which aligns with E: 100 ft.

Wait, but another thought: Maybe the question is asking for the maximum depth, so perhaps it's looking for the exact value without rounding, but 99.6 is about 100, so E makes sense.

Alternatively, perhaps I should express the exact fractional value. Let me compute 6215 ÷ 62.4 exactly.

6215 ÷ 62.4 = ?

Well, 62.4 × 100 = 6240, which is 25 more than 6215. So 100 - (25/62.4).

25 ÷ 62.4 ≈ 0.3997, so 100 - 0.3997 ≈ 99.6003, so about 99.6 ft.

So, yeah, 100 ft is the closest option.
</think>

To determine the maximum depth of the well that the pump can handle, we start by calculating the power output of the motor. The motor has a horsepower (hp) rating of 11.3 hp, and 1 hp is equivalent to 550 foot-pounds per second (ft-lbf/s). Thus, the power output is:

\[
\text{Power (P)} = 11.3 \, \text{hp} \times 550 \, \text{ft-lbf/s} = 6215 \, \text{ft-lbf/s}.
\]

Next, we calculate the weight flow rate of the water. The water is pumped at a rate of 1 cubic foot per second (ft³/s), and the weight density of water is 62.4 pounds per cubic foot (lb/ft³). Therefore, the weight flow rate is:

\[
\text{Weight flow rate (q)} = 1 \, \text{ft³/s} \times 62.4 \, \text{lb/ft³} = 62.4 \, \text{lb/s}.
\]

The power required to pump the water is given by the formula:

\[
P = q \times h,
\]

where \( h \) is the height (or depth) of the water being lifted. Rearranging for \( h \):

\[
h = \frac{P}{q}.
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
h = \frac{6215 \, \text{ft-lbf/s}}{62.4 \, \text{lb/s}} \approx 99.6 \, \text{ft}.
\]

The closest option to 99.6 ft is 100 ft. Therefore, the maximum depth of the well is approximately 100 ft.
