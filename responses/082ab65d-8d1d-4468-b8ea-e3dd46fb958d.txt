Question:

An online store uses 6-bit binary sequences to identify each unique item for sale. The store plans to increase the number of items it sells and is considering using 7-bit binary sequences. Which of the following best describes the result of using 7-bit sequences instead of 6- bit sequences?

Options:

A: 10 times as many items can be uniquely identified.
B: 2 more items can be uniquely identified.
C: 2 times as many items can be uniquely identified.
D: The number of uniquely identified items will remain the same.
E: 3 times as many items can be uniquely identified.
F: Half as many items can be uniquely identified.
G: 128 more items can be uniquely identified.
H: 10 more items can be uniquely identified.
I: 4 times as many items can be uniquely identified.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about binary sequences used by an online store. Let me break it down step by step. 

The store currently uses 6-bit binary sequences to identify items. I remember that each bit in a binary sequence can be either 0 or 1, so the total number of unique combinations is 2 raised to the power of the number of bits. So for 6 bits, that's 2^6. Let me calculate that: 2*2=4, 4*2=8, 8*2=16, 16*2=32, 32*2=64. So they can currently identify 64 unique items.

Now, the store is planning to switch to 7-bit sequences. Using the same logic, that would be 2^7. Let me compute that: 64 (which is 2^6) times 2 is 128. So with 7 bits, they can have 128 unique items.

The question is asking what the result of this change is. The options are A to I. Let me look at each option:

A: 10 times as many items. Well, 64 to 128 isn't 10 times. 10 times 64 would be 640, which is way higher.

B: 2 more items. That's just 2, but 128-64=64 more, so B is wrong.

C: 2 times as many. 64*2=128, which matches, so C sounds possible.

D: Same number, no, because 64 vs 128 is different.

E: 3 times as many. 3*64=192, which is higher than 128, so E is incorrect.

F: Half as many. No, 7 bits give more, not fewer.

G: 128 more items. Wait, 128-64=64 more, not 128. So G is wrong.

H: 10 more items. Again, not the case, it's 64 more.

I: 4 times as many. 4*64=256, which is way higher than 128, so I is wrong.

So the correct change is from 64 to 128, which is exactly double. So the best answer is C: 2 times as many items can be uniquely identified.

Wait, but another way to think: the number of additional items is 64, which is option G says 128 more. Oh no, wait, 2^7 is 128, which is 64 more than 64. So G says 128 more, which is incorrect because the difference is 64, not 128. So G is wrong.

So the correct option is C, which states that twice as many items can be identified.

The store moves from 6-bit to 7-bit sequences. 6 bits allow 64 unique items (2^6), while 7 bits allow 128 (2^7), which is double the original. 

Answer: C
