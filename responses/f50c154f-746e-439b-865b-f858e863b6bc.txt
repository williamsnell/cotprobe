Okay, so I've got this question about what Macedo says are the duties societies have toward nonmembers. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking which option is NOT mentioned by Macedo. The options are A to D. Let me try to remember what I know about Macedo's views on societal duties.

I recall that Macedo is a political philosopher who discusses justice and duties towards others, especially non-members. From what I remember, he talks about different types of duties that societies owe to people outside their borders.

Option A: Duties of fair dealing, like nonexploitation. That sounds familiar. I think he does mention fair dealing, perhaps in the context of international trade or relations, ensuring that interactions aren't exploitative. So A is probably a duty he does mention.

Option B: Cosmopolitan egalitarian duties, such as ensuring equal wealth. Wait, cosmopolitan egalitarianism is a theory that emphasizes equality among all people globally. I'm not sure if Macedo explicitly includes equal wealth as a duty. He might discuss equality in some form, but equal wealth seems specific. I'm not certain, but I think he might not focus on equal wealth but more on other aspects like human rights.

Option C: Duties of rectification and redress, like redressing oppression. That rings a bell. Rectification, as in correcting past wrongs or injustices. I believe he does talk about societies having a duty to address historical oppressions or ongoing injustices, so C is likely something he mentions.

Option D: Humanitarian duties, such as preventing systematic human rights violations. Definitely, I remember him discussing the responsibility to protect and prevent large-scale human rights abuses. So D is something he includes.

Putting it together, the one that's not mentioned would be B, cosmopolitan egalitarian duties regarding equal wealth. He might talk about duties towards nonmembers but perhaps not specifically about ensuring equal wealth. Instead, he might focus more on preventing violations and fair dealing rather than economic equality.
