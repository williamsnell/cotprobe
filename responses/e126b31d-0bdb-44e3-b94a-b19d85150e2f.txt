Question:

This question refers to the following information.
At a meeting of working girls held at Hull House during a strike in a large shoe factory, the discussions made it clear that the strikers who had been most easily frightened, and therefore the first to capitulate, were naturally those girls who were paying board and were afraid of being put out if they fell too far behind. After a recital of a case of peculiar hardship one of them exclaimed: "Wouldn't it be fine if we had a boarding club of our own, and then we could stand behind each other in a time like this?" After that events moved quickly. We … discussed all the difficulties and fascinations of such an undertaking, and on the first of May, 1891, two comfortable apartments near Hull House were rented and furnished. The Settlement was responsible for the furniture and paid the first month's rent, but beyond that the members managed the club themselves.… At the end of the third year the club occupied all of the six apartments which the original building contained, and numbered fifty members.
—Jane Addams, Twenty Years at Hull House, 1912

Okay, so I've got this question here about a passage from Jane Addams' "Twenty Years at Hull House." I'm not super familiar with all the details, but I know Hull House was a settlement house, right? It was involved in social work and helping immigrants and the poor in the late 1800s and early 1900s. Jane Addams was a big figure in social reform.

The passage talks about a meeting of working girls during a strike in a shoe factory. The discussion brings up how the girls who were paying board were easily frightened and capitulated first because they were worried about losing their place to stay. Then one of them suggested having a boarding club of their own so they could support each other during tough times like strikes. The passage then describes how this idea came to fruition—renting apartments, the Settlement (probably Hull House) covering some initial costs, and the club growing to have fifty members in three years.

The question is asking which political goal this perspective supports. The options are from A to J, each representing different political aims. I need to figure out which one aligns most directly with the passage's message.

Let me go through the options one by one.

A: Greater rights for unions. Well, unions are about protecting workers' rights, collective bargaining, etc. The passage is about a boarding club that the workers created for mutual support, which might relate to union activities. But the passage doesn't directly talk about union rights or organizing; it's more about providing a safe place for workers during a strike.

B: Increasing minimum wage. That's about earnings. The passage doesn't mention wages directly; it's more about housing and support during strikes.

C: Mandatory health insurance. Again, not touched upon here. The focus is on living conditions and support during a strike, not health benefits.

D: Women's suffrage. That's about voting rights. The passage is about women's collective action, but suffrage is about the right to vote, which isn't directly addressed here.

E: Equal pay for equal work. Not mentioned in the passage. The issue here seems to be more about living conditions and solidarity rather than pay equity.

F: Weakening political machines. That's about reducing the power of political organizations, which isn't relevant to the passage's context.

G: Rent control laws. The boarding club was about providing affordable housing for the workers. If the club helps them not get evicted, it's about housing stability. So rent control, which limits how much landlords can raise rent, could be related. But the passage is more about the workers forming their own solution rather than advocating for government-imposed rent controls.

H: Child labor laws. The passage is about working girls, but it's not specifically about child labor. It's about adults, particularly women, workers organizing.

I: Improved working conditions in factories. The strike suggests that working conditions were poor enough to cause a strike. The club helps them withstand the strike, but the passage doesn't directly push for better working conditions beyond the strike context. It's more about supporting the workers during a struggle rather than advocating for better conditions in general.

J: Trust-busting. That's about breaking up large corporations or monopolies. Not related here.

Wait, but looking again, the initial issue was that the girls were worried about losing their boarding because they couldn't afford it if they fell behind. So the problem was economic instability caused by being unable to pay rent if they couldn't work. The solution was creating a boarding club to support each other. So the broader issue is economic security and housing stability. The club allowed them to stand together, which probably made them more resilient in the strike.

Looking at the options, G is rent control. But the club was a collective effort, not a government law. However, the perspective here is about providing support and stability for workers, which could align with the idea of ensuring affordable housing. Rent control is a policy aimed at making housing more affordable, so it's a related goal.

Alternatively, option I is about improved working conditions. The strike was likely about working conditions, but the passage's focus is on the workers' ability to sustain themselves during the strike, not directly about better conditions. So it's more about their ability to survive economically rather than the conditions themselves.

Another angle: the passage shows the empowerment of women in creating their own support system. This could tie into women's suffrage (D) because it's about women's ability to take collective action, but suffrage is about voting rights, not necessarily about creating clubs.

Hmm, but the question is about the political goal that the perspective supports. The club they formed is an example of mutual aid, which is a form of social support. This could be seen as supporting the idea of workers helping each other, which is a part of labor rights. But the options don't have labor rights per se; the closest is A: greater rights for unions. But the passage doesn't discuss unions per se, just the club.

Wait, maybe it's about improving working conditions in factories (I). Because if the working conditions were bad enough to cause a strike, then the underlying issue is poor conditions. The club helped them during the strike, but the root cause was the working conditions. However, the passage doesn't explicitly say they were advocating for better conditions, just that they were striking, which implies that they were fighting for something, likely better conditions.

Alternatively, the boarding club provided a safety net, so it's about economic stability, which could relate to rent control (G). Or perhaps it's about the Settlement's role in supporting them, which was part of the broader social reform movement. But the question is about the perspective of the passage, which is showing how the workers organized themselves.

Wait, but the passage's perspective is about the workers' ability to support each other, which is a form of solidarity. This is a key element of unionization, where workers come together to support each other during strikes. So maybe A: Greater rights for unions is the answer.

But wait, the passage doesn't mention unions explicitly. It's about a boarding club, not a union. So perhaps it's more about the idea of mutual support and collective action, which underpins labor rights but isn't exactly the same as union rights.

Alternatively, the fact that the club allowed them to stand together suggests that they were able to sustain the strike longer, which would tie into the success of the strike, possibly leading to better working conditions. So maybe I is the answer.

But I'm a bit torn. The passage's main point is about the boarding club, which provided housing stability. So the political goal would be about ensuring that workers, especially women, have stable housing so they can afford to participate in strikes or other forms of activism. Rent control (G) is about making housing affordable, which would prevent them from being evicted if they can't pay, similar to the boarding club.

Alternatively, the club itself is a form of self-help, which might be seen as supporting labor rights, but the options don't have a self-help option. The closest is A: unions, but unions are more about collective bargaining and contractual rights.

Wait, maybe it's about improving working conditions because the strike was about working conditions, and the club helped them sustain it. So the goal would be to improve those conditions. So I: Improved working conditions in factories.

But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again.

The passage describes a situation where workers were struggling because of their housing situation. By forming a boarding club, they could support each other. This suggests that the problem was not just the workplace conditions but also the economic instability outside. So the broader goal would be to improve the overall economic situation of workers, which could include housing. Rent control is a policy that would help with that.

Alternatively, the passage is showing how the workers organized themselves, which is a form of grassroots empowerment. This could tie into women's suffrage (D) because it's about women taking action and possibly gaining the vote to influence policies.

But the question is about the perspective of the passage supporting a political goal. The passage shows the positive outcome of the workers forming their own club, which provided stability and allowed them to continue the strike. This empowerment could be seen as supporting labor rights, which would fall under A: Greater rights for unions, but unions weren't directly involved here.

Alternatively, the passage is an example of social reform through community action, which might not directly align with the given options. But the options are limited, so I have to choose the best fit.

I think the best answer is I: Improved working conditions in factories. Because the context is a strike in a factory, and the club helped sustain the strike, which was likely about working conditions. The passage's perspective supports the idea that workers can improve their conditions through collective action, which aligns with the goal of better working conditions.
</think>

The passage describes how working girls organized a boarding club to support each other during a strike, highlighting their collective action to ensure housing stability and resilience. This focus on mutual aid and empowerment aligns with the broader goal of improving working conditions in factories, as the strike likely addressed issues within the workplace. While the boarding club provided economic stability, the underlying context of the strike suggests a push for better working conditions. Therefore, the perspective supports the political goal of **improved working conditions in factories**.
