Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which of the options is not an exception to the general rule that all contractual rights may be assigned. The question is about exceptions to the assignability of contractual rights. I remember from my studies that while most contracts can be assigned, there are certain situations where assignment isn't allowed.

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: An assignment that substantially changes the obligor's duty or risk. I think this is an exception because if the assignment changes the obligor's duties significantly, it might alter the contract's terms in a way that's not acceptable. So this would be an exception.

Option B: An assignment that changes the nature of the contract. This also sounds like an exception. If the assignment changes what the contract is about, then it's probably not allowed because it fundamentally alters the agreement.

Option C: An assignment that continues the obligor's duty or risk. Hmm, this one is tricky. If the assignment doesn't change the obligor's duties but just continues them, I'm not sure if this is an exception. Wait, actually, I think that if the assignment doesn't affect the obligor's duties, it might still be allowed. So maybe this isn't an exception. I'll have to consider this more.

Option D: An assignment that transfers rights to an incapable party. I recall that if the party you're transferring rights to is legally incapable, like a minor or someone incompetent, that could be a problem. So this is likely an exception.

Option E: An assignment that causes undue hardship or loss to the obligor. Yes, if the assignment puts undue burden on the obligor, that's an exception because it's unfair.

Option F: An assignment that reduces the value of the contract to the obligor. If the value decreases, that might affect the obligor negatively, so this could be an exception.

Option G: An assignment of future rights from future contracts. I think this is an issue because you can't assign rights that haven't been contracted yet. So this is an exception.

Option H: An assignment that is made without the consent of the other party. Wait, I thought that in some cases, consent is needed, especially if the contract requires it. But generally, some assignments don't require consent unless the contract specifically says so. So maybe this isn't always an exception. Or perhaps it's an exception if the contract prohibits assignment without consent. I'm a bit confused here.

Option I: An assignment not allowed by law. Definitely an exception because certain laws or regulations might prevent assignment.

Now, the question is asking which is NOT an exception. So I need to find the option that doesn't fall under the exceptions.

Looking back, option C says the assignment continues the obligor's duty or risk. Wait, does that mean it doesn't change anything? If the obligor's duties remain the same, then the assignment wouldn't be an exception because it's allowed. So option C is not an exception, making it the correct answer.

Wait, but I thought that if the assignment doesn't change anything, it's allowed. So the exceptions are when the assignment does change things in a bad way. So C isn't an exception because it's allowed.

The correct answer is **C: An assignment that continues the obligor's duty or risk.** This is not an exception because it does not alter the obligor's duties or risks, and such assignments are generally allowed under the general rule of assignability.

**Answer: C**
