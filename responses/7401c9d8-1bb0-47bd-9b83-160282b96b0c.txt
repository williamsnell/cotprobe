B: 0.008 lb
C: 8 kg
D: 800 lb
E: .8 lb
F: 8000 lb
G: 80 lb
H: 0.8 oz
I: 8 lb
J: 0.08 lb

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a water pipe that's leaking, and I need to find out how much force a patch requires to stop the leak. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the problem states that the water pressure is 80 pounds per square inch (lb/in²), and the leak size is 0.01 square inches in area. I remember that pressure is force per unit area, so the basic formula that comes to mind is P = F/A, where P is pressure, F is force, and A is area.

Wait, but I need to find the force, so rearranging the formula, F = P * A. That makes sense because the force would be the pressure multiplied by the area over which it's applied.

Let me write down the given values:

Pressure (P) = 80 lb/in²
Area (A) = 0.01 in²

So plugging these into the formula: F = 80 lb/in² * 0.01 in².

Hmm, the square inches should cancel out, leaving just pounds, which is the unit we want for force.

Calculating that: 80 * 0.01 is 0.8. So F = 0.8 lb.

Wait, but let me double-check. Sometimes in these problems, units can trip you up. The area is in square inches, and pressure is per square inch, so when multiplied, the square inches cancel, leaving pounds, which is correct for force.

Looking back at the options, option E is 0.8 lb, which matches my calculation. So that should be the answer.

The force required to stop the leak is calculated by multiplying the pressure by the area of the leak. Using the formula F = P * A, where P is 80 lb/in² and A is 0.01 in², the force is 0.8 lb. 

Answer: E
