Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again and break it down.

The problem says there's a vessel with a frictionless piston containing 1 ft³ of gas at 200 psia. The piston is held by an external force. We're supposed to calculate the work done in two scenarios: a) when the external force is released gradually so that the volume doubles and PV remains constant, and b) when the force is released suddenly to half its initial value.

Hmm, I remember that in thermodynamics, work done by the gas when the piston moves is given by the integral of P dV. But wait, since the piston is frictionless, the work done would be against the external pressure, right? Or is it the other way around?

Wait, no. The work done by the gas is when it expands against some external pressure. If the piston is moving, the work done is P_ext * ΔV, but that's for quasi-static processes. But in this case, the process is a bit different.

Let me think about part a first. The external force is released gradually, so it's a quasi-static process. And during this, PV remains constant. So PV is constant, which suggests that the process is isothermal for an ideal gas because PV = nRT, so if PV is constant, T is constant. So it's an isothermal expansion.

Wait, but wait. PV = constant doesn't necessarily mean it's isothermal unless the gas is ideal. But the problem doesn't specify, so I'll assume it's an ideal gas.

So, for an isothermal process, the work done is nRT ln(V2/V1). But wait, I don't know n, R, or T. Alternatively, since PV is constant, maybe I can express work in terms of pressure and volume.

Alternatively, since PV is constant, P1 V1 = P2 V2. Because in isothermal processes, pressure and volume are inversely proportional.

Wait, but in the problem, the volume is doubled, so V2 = 2 V1 = 2 ft³. The initial pressure is 200 psia. So P1 V1 = P2 V2. So 200 psia * 1 ft³ = P2 * 2 ft³. That gives P2 = 100 psia.

But wait, that's if it's isothermal. So the process is from (P1, V1) to (P2, V2) with PV constant.

Now, the work done by the gas during expansion is the integral from V1 to V2 of P dV. Since PV is constant, P = (P1 V1)/V. So the integral becomes P1 V1 ∫ (1/V) dV from V1 to V2.

Which is P1 V1 ln(V2/V1). So plugging in the numbers: P1 is 200 psia, V1 is 1 ft³, V2 is 2 ft³.

So work W = 200 * 1 * ln(2) = 200 * ln(2). Let me calculate that. ln(2) is approximately 0.6931, so 200 * 0.6931 ≈ 138.62 ft-lbf.

Wait, that can't be right because the options are way larger than that. Did I miss something? Oh wait, units! Because 1 psia is pounds per square inch absolute, and 1 ft² is 144 in². So I should convert pressure to lbf/ft².

Oh right! Because work is in ft-lbf, so pressure needs to be in lbf/ft².

So 1 psia = 144 psi, since 1 psi = 1 lb/in², so 144 psi = 144 lb/in² * 144 in²/ft² = 20736 lb/ft².

Wait, no. Wait, 1 psi is 1 lb per square inch. So 1 psia is 1 lb/in². To convert to lb/ft², since 1 ft² = 144 in², so 1 lb/in² = 144 lb/ft². So 200 psia = 200 * 144 lb/ft² = 28,800 lb/ft².

So P in lb/ft² is 28,800.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, 1 psia is 144 psi, right? No, wait no, 1 psi is 1 lb per square inch. So 1 psia is 1 lb per square inch. To convert to lb per square foot, since 1 ft² = 144 in², so 1 lb/in² = 144 lb/ft². So 200 psia is 200 * 144 = 28,800 lb/ft².

Wait, that's correct. So P1 is 28,800 lb/ft².

So going back to work done: W = P1 V1 ln(V2/V1) = 28,800 lb/ft² * 1 ft³ * ln(2) ≈ 28,800 * 0.6931 ≈ 20,000 ft-lbf.

Wait, because 28,800 * 0.6931 is approximately 20,000. Let me check: 28,800 * 0.6931 ≈ 20,000. So approximately 19,930 ft-lbf.

Looking at the options, option A is 19,930 and 14,400. So for part a, the answer would be 19,930.

Now, part b: the external force is released suddenly to half its initial value. Hmm, so the external force is suddenly reduced, which changes the pressure.

Wait, the initial force F_initial is what's holding the piston. The force is related to pressure. For a piston with area A, F = P * A. But the volume is V = A * x, where x is the position. Wait, but since the piston is frictionless, when the force is released, the pressure will drop.

Wait, but the problem says the external force is released to half its initial value. So F_new = 0.5 F_initial. Since F = P * A, the new pressure would be P_new = (F_new / A) = 0.5 (F_initial / A) = 0.5 P_initial.

So initial pressure was 200 psia, so new pressure is 100 psia.

But wait, the process is sudden, so it's not a quasi-static process. So the volume might not change instantaneously. Wait, no. When the force is released, the piston will move until the internal pressure equals the external pressure. So the piston will move, causing the volume to increase until P_ext equals P_gas.

Wait, but the initial state is 200 psia. When the external force is halved, the new external pressure is 100 psia. So the gas will expand until its pressure drops to 100 psia. So the new volume can be found using the ideal gas law, assuming it's isothermal, but wait, no, because the process is sudden, maybe it's not isothermal.

Wait, but without knowing the process, perhaps we can assume it's an isothermal expansion, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a free expansion, but that's when there's no external pressure. Hmm.

Wait, in this case, the external pressure drops to 100 psia, so the gas will expand against this lower pressure. So the work done would be P_ext * ΔV.

Wait, but wait. The external pressure is 100 psia, which is 14,400 lb/ft² (since 100 * 144 = 14,400). The volume change is from 1 ft³ to V2, which we can find using the ideal gas law if we assume it's isothermal.

Wait, but PV = constant for isothermal. So initial PV is 200 psia * 1 ft³ = 200 * 144 lb/ft² * 1 ft³ = 28,800 ft-lbf.

At the end, P2 = 100 psia, so V2 = (P1 V1) / P2 = (200 * 1) / 100 = 2 ft³.

So the volume doubles again. So the change in volume is 1 ft³.

So the work done would be the external pressure times the change in volume. So W = P_ext * ΔV = 14,400 lb/ft² * 1 ft³ = 14,400 ft-lbf.

Wait, but hold on. In the first case, part a, the work was 19,930, and in part b, it's 14,400. Looking at the options, option A is (19,930, 14,400), so that's the first option.

But wait, is that correct? Because in part a, the work is done by the gas expanding against a varying pressure, while in part b, the external pressure is constant at 100 psia, so the work is P_ext * (V2 - V1) = 14,400 * 1 = 14,400 ft-lbf.

Yes, that makes sense. So the two parts are 19,930 and 14,400, which is option A.
</think>

The problem involves calculating the work done by a gas in two scenarios: a gradual isothermal expansion (part a) and a sudden pressure reduction (part b). 

### Part a:
The process is isothermal, meaning PV remains constant. The work done is calculated using the formula:

\[
W = P_1 V_1 \ln\left(\frac{V_2}{V_1}\right)
\]

Given:
- \( P_1 = 200 \, \text{psia} = 28,800 \, \text{lbf/ft}^2 \)
- \( V_1 = 1 \, \text{ft}^3 \)
- \( V_2 = 2 \, \text{ft}^3 \)

Substituting the values:

\[
W = 28,800 \times 1 \times \ln(2) \approx 28,800 \times 0.6931 \approx 19,930 \, \text{ft-lbf}
\]

### Part b:
The external force is suddenly halved, reducing the external pressure to \( P_{\text{ext}} = 100 \, \text{psia} = 14,400 \, \text{lbf/ft}^2 \). The volume doubles, so the work done is:

\[
W = P_{\text{ext}} \times (V_2 - V_1) = 14,400 \times 1 = 14,400 \, \text{ft-lbf}
\]

### Final Answer:
The work done in the two scenarios is \( 19,930 \, \text{ft-lbf} \) and \( 14,400 \, \text{ft-lbf} \), respectively.
