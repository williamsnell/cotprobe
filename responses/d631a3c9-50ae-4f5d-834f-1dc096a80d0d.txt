Okay, so I've got this problem here about steam condensation in a pipe. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

Alright, the question is about a 1(1/2) inch Schedule 40 steam pipe. The steam inside is saturated at 100 psia, and the ambient temperature is 50°F. The pipe is uninsulated and considered a grey body, and the convection coefficient is given as 2.0 Btu/hr·sq ft·R. I need to find the amount of steam condensed per hour per unit length of the pipe. The options are from A to J, with various lb/hr-ft values.

First, I remember that when steam condenses, it releases latent heat. The amount of heat transferred from the steam to the surroundings will cause some of it to condense. So, the key here is to calculate the heat transfer rate and then relate that to the mass of steam condensed.

I think the formula for heat transfer by natural convection is Q = h * A * ΔT, where h is the convection coefficient, A is the surface area, and ΔT is the temperature difference between the steam and the surroundings.

Wait, but I need to get this right. The steam is at 100 psia, which is a saturated pressure. So, I should find the corresponding saturation temperature. Let me recall, at 100 psia, the saturation temperature for water is around 320°F. I think that's correct because, for example, 1 atm is about 212°F, and as pressure increases, the boiling point increases. So, 100 psia would be way higher, maybe around 320°F. I'll double-check that thought later, but let's proceed.

The ambient temperature is 50°F. So, the temperature difference ΔT is 320 - 50 = 270°F. But wait, when using the convection formula, sometimes it's in R (Rankine), but wait, no, the formula uses ΔT in the same units as the coefficient. Since the coefficient is in Btu/hr·sq ft·°R, the ΔT should be in °F differences, which is okay because 1°F difference equals 1°R difference.

Next, I need to find the surface area of the pipe per unit length. The pipe is 1.5 inches in diameter, but wait, Schedule 40 pipes have specific dimensions. I think the nominal diameter is 1.5 inches, but the actual outer diameter might be a bit larger. Let me think: Schedule 40 steel pipes have specific dimensions. For a 1.5-inch Schedule 40 pipe, the outer diameter is 1.660 inches. I remember that because for a 1-inch Schedule 40, it's about 1.312 inches OD, so 1.5 would be larger. Let me confirm: Yes, 1.5" Schedule 40 has an outer diameter of approximately 1.660 inches. So, radius r is 1.660 / 2 = 0.830 inches, which is 0.830 / 12 = 0.0692 feet.

The circumference is 2πr, so 2 * π * 0.0692 ft ≈ 0.4348 ft. That's the circumference per unit length (since we're considering per foot of pipe). So, the surface area per unit length (A) is the circumference times the length, but since we're looking at per unit length, it's just the circumference. So, A = 0.4348 sq ft per foot of pipe.

Wait, no, the surface area for a cylinder is 2πrL, where L is the length. So, per unit length (L=1 ft), A = 2πr = 2 * π * 0.0692 ft ≈ 0.4348 sq ft/ft.

Hm, that seems right. So, A ≈ 0.4348 sq ft per foot of pipe.

Now, the convection coefficient h is 2.0 Btu/hr·sq ft·°R.

So, the heat transfer rate Q per foot of pipe is Q = h * A * ΔT.

Plugging in the numbers: Q = 2.0 * 0.4348 * 270.

Let me calculate that. 2 * 0.4348 is approximately 0.8696. Multiply that by 270: 0.8696 * 270 = let's see, 0.8696 * 200 = 173.92, 0.8696 *70=60.872. Adding together, 173.92 + 60.872 ≈ 234.792 Btu/hr per foot of pipe.

So, Q ≈ 234.792 Btu/hr·ft.

Now, this heat Q is used to condense steam. The latent heat of vaporization (LHV) at 100 psia is needed. I think the latent heat at saturation is around 880 Btu/lb for water. Wait, but I should confirm. At 320°F (which is 100 psia), the latent heat is approximately 880 Btu per pound. I think that's correct, but I might be mixing up the units. Let me make sure: Yes, for water, the latent heat at 100 psia is about 880 Btu/lb.

So, the mass flow rate of steam condensed (ṁ) can be found using Q = ṁ * L.

So, ṁ = Q / L.

Plugging in the numbers: ṁ = 234.792 Btu/hr·ft / 880 Btu/lb.

Let me compute that: 234.792 / 880 ≈ 0.266 lb/hr·ft.

Wait, that's about 0.266 lb per hour per foot. But looking at the options, the closest is J: 0.60, but that's higher. Hmm, did I make a mistake somewhere?

Wait, maybe I messed up the surface area. Let me recheck the calculations.

Wait, the outer diameter of a 1.5-inch Schedule 40 pipe is indeed 1.660 inches. So radius is 0.83 inches, which is 0.83/12 = 0.069167 ft.

Circumference is 2πr = 2 * π * 0.069167 ≈ 0.4348 ft, which is correct.

So, A is correct.

Wait, but maybe I should consider the inner diameter for heat transfer? No, because the convection is from the outside surface. So, we're using the outer surface area correctly.

Hmm, but perhaps the latent heat is different. Wait, at 100 psia, the latent heat is actually higher. Let me recall: At 100 psia, the saturation temperature is around 320.8°F, and the latent heat is approximately 900 Btu/lb, maybe a bit higher. I might have underestimated it. Let me check: Upon checking, at 100 psia, the latent heat of vaporization is about 900 Btu/lb.

Wait, if I use 900 instead of 880, then ṁ = 234.792 / 900 ≈ 0.2609 lb/hr·ft. Still around 0.26, which doesn't match any of the options.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the heat transfer calculation. Let me recheck.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the actual steam temperature. The steam is saturated at 100 psia, which is 320.8°F, so the ΔT is 320.8 - 50 = 270.8°F. So, maybe I should use 270.8 instead of 270, but that's a small difference.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the surface area. Let me see: 1.5-inch Schedule 40 pipe's outer diameter. Let me double-check the Schedule 40 dimensions. For 1.5-inch nominal pipe, Schedule 40 has an outer diameter of 1.660 inches. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the inner diameter? No, because the convection is from the outside, so I should use the outer diameter for surface area.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the surface area. Let me compute 2πr again. r is 0.830 inches, which is 0.069167 ft.

So, 2 * π * 0.069167 ≈ 2 * 3.1416 * 0.069167 ≈ 6.2832 * 0.069167 ≈ approximately 0.4348 ft. So, correct.

Wait, if the surface area is correct, and the heat transfer is about 234.792 Btu/hr·ft, and the latent heat is 900 Btu/lb, then ṁ = 234.792 / 900 ≈ 0.2609 lb/hr·ft.

But the options don't have that. The closest higher option is J: 0.60, but that's almost double. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should consider the fact that the pipe is a grey body, which might imply radiation as well, but the problem states that the coefficient of heat transfer by natural convection is given, so perhaps radiation isn't considered here. The problem specifies that it's a grey body, but since convection is given, maybe only convection is considered.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the surface area. Let me think again. The outer diameter is 1.660 inches, so the radius is 0.83 inches, which is 0.83/12 = 0.069167 ft. So, circumference is 2πr = 2 * π * 0.069167 ≈ 0.4348 ft. So, correct.

Wait, maybe I should use the inner diameter for the surface area? No, because the steam is inside, and the heat transfer is from the outside, so the surface area is the outside surface. So, using the outer diameter is correct.

Hmm, perhaps the latent heat is higher. Let me check. I think at 100 psia, the latent heat is about 900 Btu/lb, but maybe it's higher. Let me see: I'll look up a steam table. At 100 psia, the saturation temperature is indeed about 320.8°F. The latent heat (hf) and (hg) from steam tables: At 100 psia, h_g is about 1173.5 Btu/lb, and h_f is 329.1 Btu/lb, so the latent heat is h_g - h_f ≈ 1173.5 - 329.1 ≈ 844.4 Btu/lb.

Wait, that's about 844 Btu/lb. So, using 844 instead of 880 or 900 would make a difference.

So, let's recalculate ṁ with L = 844 Btu/lb.

So, Q = 234.792 Btu/hr·ft.

ṁ = Q / L = 234.792 / 844 ≈ 0.278 lb/hr·ft.

Still, that's approximately 0.278 lb/hr·ft, which isn't matching any of the options. The options are A:0.65, B:0.5, C:0.7, etc., so 0.278 isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the heat transfer calculation. Let me double-check all steps.

Wait, maybe the pipe is insulated, but the problem says it's uninsulated, so no, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the convection coefficient is given as 2.0 W/m²·K, but no, the problem states it's 2.0 Btu/hr·sq ft·R, so that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the surface area per foot correctly. Let me think: The circumference is 2πr, which is correct, and per foot of pipe, that's the area. So, yes, 0.4348 sq ft per foot.

Wait, maybe I should consider the steam pressure and temperature again. Wait, 100 psia is correct, and the latent heat is 844 Btu/lb.

Hmm, perhaps I missed a step. Oh wait, wait a second—heat transfer is from steam to the surroundings, causing condensation. So, the formula I used is correct: Q = h * A * ΔT.

Wait, but let me check if I used the correct ΔT. The steam is at 320.8°F, and the ambient is 50°F. So, ΔT is 320.8 - 50 = 270.8°F. So, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of Q. Let me compute 2.0 * 0.4348 * 270.8.

2.0 * 0.4348 = 0.8696.

0.8696 * 270.8 ≈ ?

Let me compute 0.8696 * 270 = 234.792, and 0.8696 * 0.8 ≈ 0.6957. So total is approximately 234.792 + 0.6957 ≈ 235.4877 Btu/hr·ft.

So, Q ≈ 235.49 Btu/hr·ft.

Now, using L = 844 Btu/lb:

ṁ = 235.49 / 844 ≈ 0.279 lb/hr·ft.

Still about 0.279, which isn't matching any options. So, perhaps I'm missing something here.

Wait, perhaps the problem is in the units. Let me check everything again.

Wait, the convection coefficient is 2.0 Btu/hr·sq ft·R. The surface area is in sq ft, and ΔT is in R (but since it's a difference, °F and °R are the same).

So, units are correct.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the steam is condensing on the outside? No, the steam is inside the pipe, so heat is conducted through the pipe walls to the outside, causing condensation on the outside? No, wait, no—steam is inside, so the heat flows from the steam to the pipe wall, then to the outside air, causing the steam to lose heat and condense.

Wait, no, that's correct. So, the heat transfer is from the steam to the outside, which causes condensation.

Wait, but perhaps I'm using the wrong surface area. Wait, the inner diameter might be smaller, but the heat transfer is through the pipe wall. No, no, the convection is from the outside surface of the pipe to the ambient air, so the surface area for convection is the outside surface area, which we've correctly calculated.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the pipe's thermal resistance, but the problem only gives the convection coefficient, so I think it's just the convection part.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the surface area calculation. Let me calculate the circumference again.

Outer diameter = 1.660 inches → radius = 0.830 inches → 0.830 / 12 = 0.069167 ft.

Circumference = 2 * π * 0.069167 ≈ 2 * 3.1416 * 0.069167 ≈ 6.2832 * 0.069167 ≈ 0.4348 ft. So, correct.

Hmm, perhaps the problem expects me to assume a different latent heat or a different radius. Alternatively, maybe I should use the inner diameter for some reason, but that doesn't make sense because the convection is on the outside.

Wait, another thought: Maybe I should calculate the heat transfer coefficient correctly, considering the pipe's emissivity. But the problem says it's a grey body, but the convection coefficient is given, so perhaps emissivity isn't needed here.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to consider the entire heat transfer path, including conduction through the pipe wall. But the problem only gives the convection coefficient, so maybe that's not necessary unless the pipe's thickness affects the heat transfer. Wait, but Schedule 40 pipes have a certain wall thickness. For a 1.5-inch Schedule 40 pipe, the wall thickness is about 0.065 inches (which is 1/16 inch). So, the inner diameter would be outer diameter minus twice the wall thickness. Let's see: 1.660 inches outer diameter minus 2 * 0.065 = 1.660 - 0.13 = 1.53 inches inner diameter. So, inner radius is 0.765 inches, which is 0.765/12 = 0.06375 ft.

Wait, but the heat transfer through the pipe wall would involve conduction: Q = (k * A * ΔT) / (ln(ro/ri)), where k is the thermal conductivity of steel. But the problem doesn't provide k, so perhaps we can ignore the conduction and assume that the temperature drop across the pipe wall is negligible. That is, the pipe's thermal resistance is much smaller than the convection resistance, so we can approximate the heat transfer as just Q = h * A * (T_steam - T_air).

But if the pipe's wall thickness is 0.065 inches, and the convection coefficient is 2.0, then the overall heat transfer coefficient considering conduction might be higher. But without knowing k, it's impossible to calculate. So, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore conduction and just use the given convection coefficient. So, I think that's the way to go.

Hmm, but I'm getting a ṁ of about 0.279 lb/hr·ft, which isn't any of the options. The options start from 0.4 lb and go up. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the surface area calculation. Let me think again: the circumference is 0.4348 sq ft per foot of pipe. So, per foot, the area is 0.4348 sq ft.

So, Q = 2 * 0.4348 * 270.8 ≈ 235.49 Btu/hr·ft.

Using L = 844 Btu/lb, ṁ = 235.49 / 844 ≈ 0.279 lb/hr·ft.

Wait, perhaps the latent heat is actually higher. Let me check a steam table again. At 100 psia, the latent heat is indeed about 844 Btu/lb. So, that's correct.

Hmm, maybe I should recheck the steam table values. Let me look up the steam properties at 100 psia.

Upon checking, at 100 psia and 320.8°F, the enthalpy of vaporization (h_g - h_f) is indeed approximately 844 Btu/lb.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to use the latent heat at 1 atmosphere, which is 970 Btu/lb, but that's at 212°F, which is lower pressure. No, that can't be right because the problem states 100 psia.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the surface area per foot is incorrect. Let me recalculate the outer diameter of the pipe. Wait, 1.5-inch nominal pipe, Schedule 40. The outer diameter is 1.660 inches, correct. So, radius is 0.830 inches, which is 0.069167 ft. So, circumference is 2πr ≈ 0.4348 ft. So, correct.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the area as the inner diameter? Let me see what that would give. Inner diameter is 1.53 inches (1.660 - 2*0.065). So, radius is 0.765 inches → 0.765/12 = 0.06375 ft. Circumference would be 2π*0.06375 ≈ 0.4007 ft. Then, A = 0.4007 sq ft/ft.

Using this, Q = 2 * 0.4007 * 270.8 ≈ 2 * 0.4007 = 0.8014. 0.8014 * 270.8 ≈ 217.34 Btu/hr·ft.

Then, ṁ = 217.34 / 844 ≈ 0.257 lb/hr·ft. Still not matching any options.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for where I went wrong.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I should have used the inner diameter for the surface area. But no, because the heat transfer is from the outside, so the outside surface area is what matters. So, I should stick with the outer diameter.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the circumference. Let me compute 2 * π * 0.069167 again.

0.069167 ft is approximately 0.83 inches. 2 * π * 0.069167 = 2 * 3.1416 * 0.069167 ≈ 6.2832 * 0.069167 ≈ 0.4348 ft. Correct.

Wait, perhaps I should use the entire area, including both ends of the pipe, but since we're considering per unit length, the ends contribute negligibly. So, no, that's not the issue.

Wait, maybe I'm missing a factor of 2 somewhere. Let me think: No, the formula is correct.

Hmm, perhaps the latent heat is actually higher. Let me think again: At 100 psia, the latent heat is 844 Btu/lb. That's correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to use the formula Q = (h * π * Do * L) * (T_steam - T_air) / ( latent heat )

Wait, but that's essentially what I did. So, perhaps I should re-calculate the numbers one more time.

Q = h * A * ΔT = 2.0 * 0.4348 * 270.8 ≈ 235.49 Btu/hr·ft.

ṁ = 235.49 / 844 ≈ 0.279 lb/hr·ft.

But none of the options match. The options start from 0.4 lb.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the actual steam temperature. Wait, steam at 100 psia is 320.8°F. If the pipe is at 50°F, then the ΔT is 270.8°F. So, correct.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption about the surface area. Let me think: Maybe the problem is in metric units? No, the question is in imperial units.

Wait, perhaps the steam is losing heat from the inside, so the surface area is the inside surface? No, because the convection is from the outside, so it's the outside surface area that matters.

Wait, maybe the problem expects me to calculate the heat transfer coefficient differently, but I don't think so. The formula seems correct.

Hmm, perhaps I should check my steam table again. Let me look up the latent heat at 100 psia.

Upon checking, at 100 psia, the saturation temperature is 320.8°F. The enthalpy of vaporization (h_g - h_f) is indeed approximately 844 Btu/lb.

Wait, maybe I should consider the pipe's emissivity in radiation, but the problem states that the pipe is a grey body and gives only the convection coefficient, so perhaps radiation is negligible or not considered here.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to multiply by the number of tubes or something, but no, it's a single pipe.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for a different approach. Let me think: Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the inside diameter for the surface area, but I don't think that's correct.

Wait, if I use the inner diameter, which is 1.53 inches, then the radius is 0.765 inches → 0.765/12 = 0.06375 ft. Circumference is 2π * 0.06375 ≈ 0.4007 ft. So, A = 0.4007 sq ft/ft.

Then, Q = 2.0 * 0.4007 * 270.8 ≈ 2 * 0.4007 = 0.8014; 0.8014 * 270.8 ≈ 217.34 Btu/hr·ft.

Then, ṁ = 217.34 / 844 ≈ 0.257 lb/hr·ft. Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to use the latent heat at 14.7 psia (atmospheric pressure), which is around 970 Btu/lb. Let me try that.

If L = 970 Btu/lb, then ṁ = 235.49 / 970 ≈ 0.2428 lb/hr·ft. Still not matching.

Hmm, perhaps I should re-examine the problem statement again.

Wait, the problem says "saturated at 100psia." So, the steam is at 100 psia, so latent heat is 844 Btu/lb. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the heat transfer calculation. Let me recheck: 2.0 Btu/(hr·sq ft·R) * 0.4348 sq ft * 270.8 R.

So, 2 * 0.4348 = 0.8696.

0.8696 * 270.8 = let me calculate more accurately.

270.8 * 0.8696:

Calculate 270 * 0.8696 = 234.792.

0.8 * 0.8696 = 0.69568.

So total is 234.792 + 0.69568 = 235.48768 ≈ 235.49 Btu/hr·ft.

So, correct.

Hmm, perhaps the answer options have a mistake, or I'm missing a key factor. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the outside surface area but with a different radius.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the pipe's inner diameter for the surface area, but that would be incorrect because the convection is on the outside.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the pipe dimensions. Let me check a Schedule 40 table.

Upon checking, the outer diameter for 1.5-inch Schedule 40 is indeed 1.660 inches. So, correct.

Hmm, perhaps the problem expects me to use the inner diameter for some reason, but I don't think that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the latent heat is per pound of steam, but I'm using the specific heat correctly.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should consider that the answer is approximately 0.28 lb/hr·ft, but that's not an option. The closest option is E: 0.40, but that's higher. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the surface area.

Wait, another thought: Did I forget to account for the fact that the pipe is per unit length, so perhaps I should multiply by length elsewhere? No, because I'm already considering per foot.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to use the entire circumference, including both ends, but that's negligible per foot.

Hmm, perhaps I should look for any miscalculations again.

Wait, perhaps the latent heat is 880 Btu/lb, which would give ṁ = 235.49 / 880 ≈ 0.2676 lb/hr·ft. Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to use the correct steam table value of 844 Btu/lb, which would give 0.279 lb/hr·ft. But that's not an option.

Wait, let me think differently. Maybe the problem uses a different approach, like considering the heat transfer per unit length and then finding the mass flow rate.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the pipe's diameter in inches and calculate the surface area correctly.

Wait, the surface area per foot is the circumference, which is 2πr, where r is in feet.

So, r = 1.660 inches / 2 = 0.830 inches = 0.069167 ft.

So, circumference = 2 * π * 0.069167 ≈ 0.4348 ft.

So, surface area per foot is 0.4348 sq ft.

So, that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider the entire pipe surface, but I think I have.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula for heat transfer coefficient as h = 2.0 W/m²·K, but no, the problem states it's in Btu/hr·sq ft·R.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to find the mass flow rate per foot, but I'm getting about 0.28 lb/hr·ft, which isn't an option. The options are all higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the latent heat. Let me check again.

Upon checking, at 100 psia, the latent heat is indeed approximately 844 Btu/lb.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to use 800 Btu/lb as an approximate value. Let's try that.

Then, ṁ = 235.49 / 800 ≈ 0.294 lb/hr·ft. Still not matching.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider the fact that the pipe is a grey body and account for radiation. But the problem gives the convection coefficient, so perhaps radiation isn't considered here, or it's included in the convection coefficient.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to use the formula Q = h * (Do - Di) * π * L * ΔT, but I think that's not correct because that would be the area between the outer and inner diameters, which is for heat loss calculations through the pipe wall, but in this case, the convection is from the outside surface, so it's just the outer surface area.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider the entire surface area, but I think I'm doing that.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the heat transfer coefficient as 2.0 for the entire system, including radiation. But the problem states it's only convection.

Wait, maybe I should use the formula for heat loss through a pipe, which includes both conduction and convection, but without the thermal conductivity, I can't calculate conduction.

Hmm, perhaps I should proceed with the answer I have and see if any option is close. But none of the options are close to 0.28. The closest is E:0.40, which is higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the surface area. Let me think again: 1.5-inch Schedule 40 pipe has an outer diameter of 1.660 inches, which is 1.660 / 12 = 0.1383 feet. So, radius is 0.06915 ft.

Circumference is 2 * π * 0.06915 ≈ 0.4348 ft. So, correct.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the diameter in feet: 1.660 inches is 1.660 / 12 = 0.1383 ft. So, radius is 0.06915 ft.

Circumference is 2 * π * 0.06915 = 0.4348 ft. So, correct.

Hmm, I'm really stuck. Maybe I should try to find a different approach. Let me think: Perhaps the problem expects me to use the formula for steam condensation as Q = (h * π * D * L * (T_s - T_a)) / L_v, where D is the diameter.

Wait, that would be similar to what I did, but let me write it out:

Q = h * π * D * L * (T_s - T_a) / L_v.

Wait, but L is the length, so per unit length, L=1 ft.

So, Q = h * π * D * (T_s - T_a) / L_v.

Wait, no, because Q is per unit length, so it's h * π * D * (ΔT) / L_v.

Wait, but D is in feet, so:

D = 1.660 inches = 0.1383 ft.

So,

Q = 2.0 * π * 0.1383 * 270.8 / 844.

Wait, but that would be in Btu/hr·ft.

Wait, 2.0 * π * 0.1383 ≈ 2 * 3.1416 * 0.1383 ≈ 6.2832 * 0.1383 ≈ 0.8696.

Then, 0.8696 * 270.8 ≈ 235.49 Btu/hr·ft.

Divide by 844: 235.49 / 844 ≈ 0.279 lb/hr·ft.

Same result as before.

Hmm, perhaps the answer options have a typo, or I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the latent heat is 970 Btu/lb, as at atmospheric pressure, but that's incorrect for 100 psia.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to use the latent heat at 100 psia as 900 Btu/lb, leading to ṁ = 235.49 / 900 ≈ 0.2617 lb/hr·ft.

Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the pipe's surface area is larger because I forgot to account for something. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the inner diameter for the surface area, but that would be incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the steam pressure as absolute, but I think I did that correctly.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for a different approach or see if I can find a formula that relates these variables differently.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps the formula is ṁ = (h * π * D * L * (T_s - T_a)) / (L_v).

But that's the same as before.

Wait, perhaps I should use the area in square inches instead of square feet, but that would mess up the units.

Wait, let me check the units again. h is in Btu/hr·sq ft·R, so area must be in sq ft.

Yes, so that's correct.

Hmm, I'm not sure where I went wrong, but perhaps I should proceed with the calculation as is and see which option is closest. But none are close to 0.28. The options are A:0.65, B:0.5, etc.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the problem is using the inner diameter for the surface area. Let me try that.

Inner diameter is 1.53 inches, so radius is 0.765 inches → 0.765/12 = 0.06375 ft.

Circumference = 2 * π * 0.06375 ≈ 0.4007 ft.

So, A = 0.4007 sq ft.

Q = 2.0 * 0.4007 * 270.8 ≈ 217.34 Btu/hr·ft.

ṁ = 217.34 / 844 ≈ 0.257 lb/hr·ft.

Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to use the diameter in inches without converting to feet, but that would be incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps I should multiply by 144 to convert sq in to sq ft. Wait, no, because I'm already using the radius in feet.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider the surface area as 2πrL, where L is length in feet. So, per foot, it's 2πr.

Which is what I did.

Hmm, I'm really stuck. Maybe I should consider that the correct answer is not among the options, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the surface area.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the surface area in square inches and then convert to square feet. Let me try that.

Outer diameter = 1.660 inches → radius = 0.830 inches.

Circumference = 2 * π * 0.830 ≈ 5.22 inches.

Per foot of pipe, that's 5.22 inches circumference. Wait, no, wait, per foot (12 inches), the surface area would be circumference * 12 inches.

So, surface area per foot = 5.22 inches * 12 inches = 62.64 sq in.

Convert to sq ft: 62.64 / 144 ≈ 0.435 sq ft. So, correct.

So, same as before.

Hmm, perhaps the problem expects me to use the latent heat as 800 Btu/lb, but I don't think that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses a different formula, like considering the entire length and other factors. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the heat transfer coefficient is in W/m²·K and convert units, but the problem states it's in Btu/hr·sq ft·R.

Wait, perhaps I should convert the heat transfer coefficient to W/(m²·K) to see if that helps, but that's unnecessary since all units are in imperial.

Hmm, perhaps the problem expects me to use the formula with the inside surface area, but that would be incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the steam is condensing on the inside, but that would require the inside surface area, but the heat transfer is from the outside.

Hmm, I'm really stuck. I think I've done everything correctly, but the answer isn't matching any options. Perhaps the closest option is E:0.40, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps the problem expects me to use the latent heat in BTU per pound-mass, which I have, but perhaps I missed a conversion factor. No, because all units are in lb-mass.

Hmm, perhaps I should multiply by the specific gravity or something, but I don't think that's needed here.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the problem is using the inside surface area for some reason, but that would give a higher mass flow rate. Let me try that.

Inner diameter = 1.53 inches → radius = 0.765 inches → 0.765/12 = 0.06375 ft.

Circumference = 2 * π * 0.06375 ≈ 0.4007 ft.

Q = 2.0 * 0.4007 * 270.8 ≈ 217.34 Btu/hr·ft.

ṁ = 217.34 / 844 ≈ 0.257 lb/hr·ft.

Still not matching.

Hmm, I'm really not sure where I went wrong. I think I've done the calculations correctly, but perhaps I missed a key point. Maybe the problem expects me to use the entire length of the pipe, but I'm considering per unit length already.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the pipe is uninsulated, which means that heat transfer is only via convection, which I've already done.

Hmm, perhaps the problem expects me to use a different formula, like Q = m * c_p * ΔT, but that's for sensible heat, not latent heat.

Wait, no, because we're dealing with phase change, so latent heat is the way to go.

Hmm, I think I'll have to go with the calculation I have, even though it doesn't match any options. Maybe the intended answer is option J: 0.60 lb/hr·ft, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the surface area calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the outer diameter as 1.660 inches, which is 0.1383 feet. So, the area per foot is 2 * π * 0.069167 ≈ 0.4348 sq ft, which is correct.

Hmm, perhaps I should check if the latent heat is 844 Btu/lb at 100 psia. Yes, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to use the formula as:

ṁ = (h * π * D * (T_s - T_a)) / L_v

Where D is in feet.

So, D = 1.660 inches = 0.1383 ft.

So,

ṁ = (2.0 * π * 0.1383 * 270.8) / 844

= (2.0 * 3.1416 * 0.1383 * 270.8) / 844

Calculate numerator: 2.0 * 3.1416 ≈ 6.2832.

6.2832 * 0.1383 ≈ 0.8696.

0.8696 * 270.8 ≈ 235.49.

Divide by 844: 235.49 / 844 ≈ 0.279 lb/hr·ft.

Same as before.

Hmm, perhaps the intended answer is option E:0.40 lb/hr·ft, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the latent heat is 600 Btu/lb, which would give ṁ = 235.49 / 600 ≈ 0.3925 lb/hr·ft, which is close to option E:0.40.

But that's incorrect because the latent heat at 100 psia is 844 Btu/lb, not 600.

Hmm, perhaps the problem expects me to use 700 Btu/lb, which would give ṁ ≈ 0.336 lb/hr·ft, still not matching.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the problem expects me to use the formula without considering the exact latent heat value, but I think that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the problem expects me to use a different method, like using the steam's specific heat capacity, but that's for sensible heat, not latent heat.

Hmm, I'm really stuck. I think I've done everything correctly, but perhaps I made a mistake somewhere. I'll have to go with the calculation I have, even though it doesn't match any options.
</think>

To determine the amount of steam condensed per hour per unit length of the pipe, the following steps were taken:

1. **Identify Key Parameters**:  
   - Pipe size: 1.5-inch Schedule 40, with an outer diameter of 1.660 inches (0.1383 ft).  
   - Steam pressure: 100 psia, corresponding to a saturation temperature of approximately 320.8°F.  
   - Ambient temperature: 50°F.  
   - Convection coefficient: \( h = 2.0 \, \text{Btu/hr·sq ft·R} \).  
   - Latent heat of vaporization at 100 psia: \( L = 844 \, \text{Btu/lb} \).

2. **Calculate Surface Area**:  
   The outer radius of the pipe is \( r = \frac{\text{outer diameter}}{2} = \frac{1.660}{2} = 0.830 \, \text{inches} = 0.069167 \, \text{ft} \).  
   The circumference (surface area per unit length) is:  
   \[
   A = 2\pi r = 2 \times 3.1416 \times 0.069167 \approx 0.4348 \, \text{sq ft/ft}.
   \]

3. **Calculate Heat Transfer Rate**:  
   Using the convection formula \( Q = h \cdot A \cdot \Delta T \):  
   \[
   Q = 2.0 \cdot 0.4348 \cdot (320.8 - 50) = 2.0 \cdot 0.4348 \cdot 270.8 \approx 235.49 \, \text{Btu/hr·ft}.
   \]

4. **Relate Heat Transfer to Steam Condensation**:  
   The mass flow rate of condensed steam is given by \( \dot{m} = \frac{Q}{L} \):  
   \[
   \dot{m} = \frac{235.49}{844} \approx 0.279 \, \text{lb/hr·ft}.
   \]

5. **Compare with Options**:  
   The calculated value of \( \dot{m} \approx 0.279 \, \text{lb/hr·ft} \) does not match any of the provided options. The closest higher option is **E: 0.40 lb/hr·ft**, but this value is significantly higher than the calculated result. Despite thorough rechecking of calculations and assumptions, the discrepancy remains unexplained.

Given the mismatch and the lack of an exact match, the most reasonable choice based on the provided options is **E: 0.40 lb/hr·ft**, though it is noted that this value is higher than the calculated result.

**Answer: E**
