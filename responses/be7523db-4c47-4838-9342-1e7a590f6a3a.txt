Okay, so I have this problem where I'm given two opposite vertices of a square on a Cartesian plane, specifically the points (1,2) and (7,4). I need to find the area of the square. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that in a square, the diagonals are equal in length and they bisect each other at 90 degrees. Wait, no, actually, in a square, the diagonals are equal and they bisect each other at 90 degrees, but they aren't perpendicular unless it's a square. Oh right, but in a square, the diagonals are perpendicular. So, the distance between these two opposite vertices is the length of the diagonal.

So, the first step is to find the distance between (1,2) and (7,4). The distance formula is sqrt[(x2-x1)^2 + (y2-y1)^2]. Plugging in the values, that would be sqrt[(7-1)^2 + (4-2)^2] = sqrt[6^2 + 2^2] = sqrt[36 +4] = sqrt[40]. So, the diagonal length is sqrt(40).

Now, since the diagonal of a square relates to its side length. I recall that the diagonal d of a square with side length s is d = s*sqrt(2). So, if the diagonal is sqrt(40), then s = sqrt(40)/sqrt(2). Let me compute that: sqrt(40) is 2*sqrt(10), so divided by sqrt(2) is (2*sqrt(10))/sqrt(2) = 2*sqrt(10/2) = 2*sqrt(5). So, the side length s is 2*sqrt(5).

Then, the area of the square is s^2. So, (2*sqrt(5))^2 = 4*5 = 20. Wait, that gives me 20, which is option B. Hmm, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Alternatively, I could think about the area in terms of the diagonal. I remember that the area of a square can also be calculated as (d^2)/2, where d is the diagonal. So, d is sqrt(40), so d squared is 40. Then, 40 divided by 2 is 20. Yep, that matches. So the area is 20.

Wait a second, another way to approach this is by considering the vectors. The two points are opposite vertices, so the vector from (1,2) to (7,4) is (6,2). This vector is the diagonal of the square. The area of the square can be found using the magnitude of this vector squared divided by 2, which is similar to what I did before. So, the magnitude squared is 6^2 + 2^2 = 36 +4 =40. Divide by 2, area is 20.

Alternatively, maybe I can find the other two vertices. Let's see, the midpoint between (1,2) and (7,4) is ((1+7)/2, (2+4)/2) = (4,3). Since the diagonals of a square bisect each other, this is the center of the square. The other two vertices would be such that they are perpendicular to the diagonal vector and at a distance that their midpoint is (4,3).

Wait, the diagonal vector is (6,2). To find the other diagonal, we need a vector perpendicular to (6,2). A perpendicular vector would be (-2,6) or (2,-6). Wait, because the dot product should be zero: 6*(-2) + 2*6 = -12 +12=0. So yes, (-2,6) is perpendicular. So the other diagonal would be this vector, but scaled appropriately.

Wait, but the length of the diagonal we found earlier is sqrt(40), so the other diagonal should also be sqrt(40). The length of (-2,6) is sqrt[(-2)^2 +6^2] = sqrt[4+36]=sqrt(40). So that's correct. So the other two vertices would be the midpoint plus and minus half of this vector. So, the midpoint is (4,3), so adding ( (-2)/2, 6/2 ) = (-1,3), so the other vertices are (4-1, 3+3) = (3,6) and (4+1, 3-3)=(5,0). Wait, but that might not be necessary for finding the area, but just confirming.

Wait, but perhaps I can compute the area using the vectors. The area of the square is the magnitude of the cross product of the vectors defining two adjacent sides. Hmm, but maybe that's more complicated. Alternatively, since I have the length of the diagonal, which is sqrt(40), and area is (d^2)/2, which is 40/2=20. So yes, that's the same as before.

Alternatively, I can think about the coordinates. The distance between the two points is sqrt(40), so that's the diagonal. Then, the area is (sqrt(40))^2 / 2 = 40/2=20. So that's consistent.

Wait, another way: the side length of the square can be found by the distance between two adjacent vertices. But since I don't have those points, perhaps I can compute the side length using the diagonal. So, as before, diagonal = s*sqrt(2), so s = diagonal / sqrt(2) = sqrt(40)/sqrt(2). Simplify sqrt(40) as 2*sqrt(10), so 2*sqrt(10)/sqrt(2) = 2*sqrt(5), since sqrt(10)/sqrt(2)=sqrt(5). Then, area is s^2= (2*sqrt(5))^2=4*5=20.

So yeah, all methods point to the area being 20, which is option B.

The area of the square is 20, which corresponds to option B.
