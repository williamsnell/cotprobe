Okay, so I have this problem about the Heavenly Flights charter club. They charge $200 annually per member. The director is thinking about reducing the fee by $2 for everyone whenever more than 60 members join. Wait, actually, the way it's phrased is a bit confusing. Let me read it again.

The club charges $200 annually. The director is considering reducing the annual fee by $2 for all members whenever applicants in excess of 60 join. Hmm, maybe I misread that. So, if the membership is more than 60, then for each additional member beyond 60, the fee decreases by $2 per member? Or is it that for every two new members beyond 60, the fee drops by $2? Wait, the example says: if membership is 60 and two new members join, the fee decreases by $4. So each new member beyond 60 causes a $2 decrease per member. So adding two new members leads to a $4 decrease, making the new fee $196.

So the structure is: when the number of members N exceeds 60, the fee per member becomes 200 - 2*(N-60). Because for each member beyond 60, the fee drops by $2. So if N is 62, fee is 200 - 2*(2) = 196. If N is 65, fee is 200 - 2*5 = 190, etc.

The goal is to find how many extra members beyond 60 will maximize the revenue. So we need to model the revenue as a function of the number of members and find its maximum.

Let me define x as the number of extra members beyond 60. So total members N = 60 + x. Then the fee per member is 200 - 2x. So revenue R is (60 + x) * (200 - 2x).

Our goal is to maximize R with respect to x, where x is a non-negative integer (since you can't have negative members).

So R = (60 + x)(200 - 2x) = 60*200 + 60*(-2x) + x*200 - x*2x.

Calculating that:

60*200 = 12,000

60*(-2x) = -120x

x*200 = 200x

- x*2x = -2x²

So R = 12,000 -120x + 200x - 2x²

Combine like terms:

-120x +200x = 80x

So R = 12,000 + 80x -2x².

This is a quadratic equation in terms of x, and since the coefficient of x² is negative (-2), the parabola opens downward, so the maximum is at the vertex.

The vertex of a quadratic ax² + bx + c is at x = -b/(2a).

Here, a = -2, b = 80.

So x = -80/(2*(-2)) = -80 / (-4) = 20.

So x=20. That means 20 extra members beyond 60, making total members 80.

Wait, but wait. We need to check if the model holds beyond x=20. Because the fee decreases by $2 per member for each extra member beyond 60. So when x=20, the fee is 200 - 2*20 = 160. Revenue is (60+20)*160 = 80*160 = 12,800.

If I take x=21, fee is 200-42=158, revenue is 81*158. Let's compute that: 80*158=12,640; 1*158=158 → total 12,798. So R=12,798, which is less than 12,800.

Similarly, x=19: fee=200-38=162. Revenue=79*162. Let's compute: 70*162=11,340; 9*162=1,458 → total 12,798. So same as x=21.

Wait, that's interesting. So at x=20, R=12,800; at x=19 and x=21, R=12,798 each. So the maximum is at x=20.

Wait, but looking back, the options are from 40 to 130. Wait, no, the options are A:110, B:60, C:120, D:50, E:80, F:100, G:130, H:40, I:90, J:70.

Wait, the question is asking for how many extra members maximize revenue. So x=20, which is the number of extra members beyond 60. But looking at the options, the closest would be E:80, which is 60+20=80 total members. But wait, the options are for the number of extra members, or the total? Wait, the question says "how many extra members maximize revenue." So x is 20. But 20 isn't an option. Hmm, wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, let me read the question again. It says, "how many extra members maximize revenue?" So x is the number of extra beyond 60. So x=20. But the options don't have 20. So perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the problem.

Wait, perhaps I misread the problem. Let me read it again.

The club charges $200. The director is considering reducing the annual fee by $2 for all members whenever applicants in excess of 60 join. For example, if membership is 60 and two new members are added, fee decreases by $4, making it $196 per member.

Wait, so for each two new members beyond 60, the fee drops by $4. Wait, no. Because in the example, adding two members leads to a $4 decrease. So per member added beyond 60, the fee drops by $2. Because two members added: 2 * $2 per member = $4 total drop.

Wait, no, the fee per member drops by $2 for each member added beyond 60. So if you add one member beyond 60, fee drops by $2. Adding two, fee drops by $4, etc.

So the fee per member is 200 - 2x, where x is the number of extra members beyond 60.

So the initial model is correct.

So the maximum occurs at x=20. But the options don't have 20. So perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that the fee is reduced by $2 for each new member beyond 60. So the fee per member is 200 - 2*(x), where x is the number of extra members. So total members is 60 + x.

But the problem is asking for the number of extra members that maximize revenue. So x=20. But the options don't have 20. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the total number of members, not the extra. Let me check the question again.

Question: How many extra members maximize revenue?

So it's the extra, so x=20. But 20 isn't an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the model.

Wait, let's re-express the revenue function. Revenue R = (60 + x) * (200 - 2x) = 12,000 +80x -2x².

Taking derivative dR/dx = 80 -4x. Set to zero: 80-4x=0 → x=20. So yes, x=20.

But the options don't have 20. So perhaps the question is not about x, but about the total number of members. So total members would be 60+20=80, which is option E.

Ah, so perhaps the question is asking for the total number of members, not the extra. Because the options include 80 (E). So the answer is E:80.

Wait, but the question says "how many extra members maximize revenue?" So extra would be 20, but since that's not an option, perhaps the question is actually asking for the total number, which is 80, option E.

Alternatively, perhaps I misread the problem. Let me check again.

Wait, the problem says the fee decreases by $2 for all members whenever applicants in excess of 60 join. So perhaps the fee is reduced by $2 for each new member beyond 60. So if N is the total number of members, then the fee per member is 200 - 2*(N-60), but only when N>60. So for N=61, fee is 198; N=62, 196, etc.

So the revenue is R = N * (200 - 2*(N-60)) when N>60.

Simplify that: R = N*(200 - 2N + 120) = N*(320 - 2N) = 320N - 2N².

To find maximum, take derivative dR/dN = 320 -4N. Set to zero: 320-4N=0 → N=80.

Ah, so N=80 is the total number of members that maximizes revenue. So the extra members beyond 60 is 20, but the question asks for the number of extra members, which is 20. But since 20 isn't an option, perhaps the question is asking for the total number, which is 80, option E.

Alternatively, perhaps I misread the problem again. Let me check the exact wording.

The question says, "how many extra members maximize revenue?" So it's asking for the number of extra beyond 60. But since 20 isn't an option, perhaps I did something wrong.

Wait, perhaps the fee is reduced by $2 for each new member beyond 60, but the fee can't go below zero. Or maybe the model is different. Wait, let's recast the problem.

Let me define x as the number of extra members beyond 60, so total members N=60+x.

Fee per member P = 200 - 2x.

Revenue R = N * P = (60+x)(200-2x) = 12,000 +80x -2x².

To find maximum, take derivative dR/dx =80 -4x. Set to zero: x=20.

So x=20 is the number of extra members. But the options don't have 20. So perhaps the answer is E:80, which is the total number of members.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the fee is reduced by $2 for each new member beyond 60, but the maximum number of extra members is such that the fee doesn't go below a certain point. But the problem doesn't specify any lower limit on the fee, so it's not a factor.

Wait, perhaps the question is phrased differently. Let me read it again.

The director is considering reducing the annual fee by $2 for all members whenever applicants in excess of 60 join. So for each new member beyond 60, the fee drops by $2. So if you add x extra members, the fee per member is 200-2x.

So the revenue is (60+x)(200-2x) =12,000 +80x -2x².

Max at x=20. So extra members is 20, total 80.

But the options don't have 20. So perhaps the question is asking for the total number, which is 80, option E.

Alternatively, perhaps I misread the problem and the fee reduction is $2 per member for each additional member beyond 60. So for example, adding 2 members beyond 60 reduces the fee by $4, as in the example. So the fee per member is 200 -2*(number of extra members). So the model is correct.

So the answer is x=20 extra members, but since that's not an option, perhaps the question is asking for the total number, which is 80, option E.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the number of extra members that can be added beyond 60 to maximize revenue, which is 20, but since that's not an option, perhaps the closest is E:80, which is the total.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the model. Let me think differently.

Wait, perhaps the fee is reduced by $2 for each new member beyond 60, but the fee is applied per new member. So if you have x extra members, each new member causes the fee to drop by $2 for everyone, including themselves. So the fee per member is 200 -2x.

So the model is correct. So x=20, extra members, total 80.

But since 20 isn't an option, perhaps the answer is E:80.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the fee is reduced by $2 for each new member beyond 60, but the problem is to find the number of extra members that maximize revenue, which is 20, but since that's not an option, perhaps the correct answer is E:80, the total number.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the model. Let me try to compute revenue at x=20 and x=21.

At x=20: N=80, fee=160. Revenue=80*160=12,800.

At x=21: N=81, fee=158. Revenue=81*158=12,798.

At x=19: N=79, fee=162. Revenue=79*162=12,798.

So maximum at x=20.

But the options don't have 20. So perhaps the question is asking for the total number, which is 80, option E.

So I think the correct answer is E:80.

The problem involves maximizing revenue for Heavenly Flights charter club. The club charges $200 annually per member, but the fee decreases by $2 for each new member beyond 60. Let \( x \) be the number of extra members beyond 60, so the total membership is \( 60 + x \). The fee per member becomes \( 200 - 2x \), and the revenue \( R \) is given by:

\[
R = (60 + x)(200 - 2x) = 12,000 + 80x - 2x^2
\]

To maximize \( R \), we find the vertex of the quadratic equation, where \( x = -\frac{b}{2a} \). Here, \( a = -2 \) and \( b = 80 \), so:

\[
x = -\frac{80}{2(-2)} = 20
\]

Thus, the number of extra members that maximizes revenue is \( x = 20 \). However, since the options do not include 20, the question likely asks for the total number of members, which is \( 60 + 20 = 80 \). Among the options, \( 80 \) corresponds to **E**.
