Okay, so I need to figure out what percentage of Indians lived in urban areas as of 2017. I'm not exactly sure about the exact number, but I'll try to think through it.

First, I remember that India is a country with a large population, and a lot of people live in rural areas. I think the urbanization rate in India isn't as high as in more developed countries. Maybe around 30% or so? But I'm not certain.

Looking at the options, let's see: A is 25%, which seems a bit low. B is 55%, that's higher than I thought. C is 70%, which I feel is too high for India back then. D is 10%, way too low. E is 40%, F is 34%, G is 49%, H is 64%, I is 19%, J is 50%.

Wait, I think I've heard that India's urban population was around 30-35% a few years ago. So maybe around 34%? That would be option F. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, I've heard that urban areas are growing, so maybe it's a bit higher now, but 2017 data might still be in the 30s.

Another angle: I recall that the urban population in India has been increasing steadily. In the early 2000s, it was around 28%, and by 2011, it was about 31%. So by 2017, maybe it went up a bit more. 34% sounds plausible.

Alternatively, some sources might say it's around 31% or 35%. But among the options, F is 34%, which is close. So I think the answer is F.

The answer is F: 34%.
