Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an electric dipole in a uniform electric field. Hmm, I remember that an electric dipole consists of two equal and opposite charges separated by some distance. The dipole moment p is given as 3.02e-25 C·m. The electric field E is 46.0 N/C. The initial angle is 64 degrees, and we're supposed to find the work done when turning the dipole 180 degrees. 

I think the work done on an electric dipole when it's rotated in an electric field is related to the change in its potential energy. Oh right, the potential energy U of a dipole in an electric field is given by U = -p·E, which can also be written as U = -pE cosθ, where θ is the angle between the dipole moment and the electric field.

So, the work done should be the change in potential energy, right? Because when you rotate the dipole, you're changing its orientation relative to the electric field, which changes its potential energy. So the work W is equal to ΔU, which is U_final minus U_initial.

Let me write that down:

W = U_final - U_initial

Each of these U terms is -pE cosθ. So,

U_initial = -pE cosθ_initial
U_final = -pE cosθ_final

The initial angle θ_initial is 64 degrees, and we're rotating it 180 degrees. So the final angle θ_final would be 64 + 180 = 244 degrees. Wait, but since electric fields and dipoles are vectors, we can also consider that rotating 180 degrees flips the direction, so the angle could be considered as 180 - 64 = 116 degrees if we take the smaller angle. Wait, no, because 64 degrees plus 180 is 244, which is the same as -116 degrees, but cos(244) is the same as cos(180 - (244-180)=116?), wait no. Let me think. Cos(244) is cos(180 + 64) which is -cos(64), because cos(180 + x) = -cos x. So cos(244) = -cos(64).

Alternatively, if you rotate 180 degrees, the dipole moment vector would point in the opposite direction, so the angle between the dipole and the field would be (180 - 64) = 116 degrees. So cos(116) is the same as cos(180-64)= -cos(64). So either way, the final angle would give a cosine that's -cos(64). So U_final would be -pE * (-cos64) = pE cos64.

Wait, that might get a bit confusing. Let me approach it step by step.

U_initial = -pE cos(64°)
U_final = -pE cos(244°) because you rotate 180° from 64°, so 64 + 180 = 244°. Alternatively, since angles in cosine are periodic every 360°, and cos(244) = cos(244 - 180) = cos(64), but wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 244 is in the third quadrant, so cos(244) = -cos(64), because 244 - 180 = 64, so cos(244) = cos(180 + 64) = -cos(64). So U_final = -pE * (-cos64) = pE cos64.

So U_initial is -pE cos64, U_final is pE cos64.

So the change in potential energy is ΔU = U_final - U_initial = pE cos64 - (-pE cos64) = 2 pE cos64.

Wait, wait, that can't be right because when you rotate the dipole 180 degrees, the potential energy should change in a way that depends on both initial and final positions. But let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the final angle is 180 - 64 = 116 degrees. Because when you rotate the dipole 180 degrees, the direction of the dipole flips. So the angle between the dipole and the field would be 180 - 64 = 116 degrees.

So U_initial = -pE cos(64)
U_final = -pE cos(116)

But cos(116) is equal to -cos(64), because cos(180 - x) = -cos x.

So U_final = -pE (-cos64) = pE cos64.

Then ΔU = U_final - U_initial = pE cos64 - (-pE cos64) = 2 pE cos64.

Wait, but that would give a positive value, which would imply that the potential energy increases. But when you rotate a dipole from a lower potential energy state to a higher one, you're doing work on it. Alternatively, if the dipole is initially at a lower potential energy, rotating it to a higher position would require work input.

Wait, but let me think about the actual process. The potential energy of a dipole is U = -pE cosθ. So when θ is 0°, U is -pE, which is the lowest possible potential energy (most stable). As θ increases, U becomes less negative, meaning higher potential energy.

So initially, the dipole is at 64 degrees, which is a higher potential energy than when it's aligned (0 degrees). When you rotate it 180 degrees, it's now at 244 degrees, which is equivalent to 116 degrees from the other side, so the angle between the dipole and the field is 116 degrees. So the potential energy would be U = -pE cos(116°), which is -pE*(-cos64) = pE cos64.

Wait, but let me compute U_initial and U_final again.

U_initial = -pE cos(64)
U_final = -pE cos(116) = -pE * (-cos64) = pE cos64

So the change in potential energy ΔU is U_final - U_initial = pE cos64 - (-pE cos64) = 2 pE cos64.

Wait, but that's 2 p E cosθ, where θ is 64 degrees.

Wait, but if the dipole is rotated 180 degrees, wouldn't the total change in potential energy be the difference between the two positions? Let me think of it another way. The work done by the electric field would be the negative of the change in potential energy. But in this case, since we are turning the dipole, the work done by an external agent would be equal to the change in potential energy.

Hmm, perhaps I should approach this by considering the torque on the dipole. The torque τ is given by τ = pE sinθ. The work done is the integral of torque dθ from initial angle to final angle.

So W = ∫ τ dθ from θ_initial to θ_final.

Which would be ∫(pE sinθ) dθ from θ_initial to θ_final.

The integral of sinθ dθ is -cosθ, so:

W = pE [ -cosθ ] from θ_initial to θ_final = pE [ -cosθ_final + cosθ_initial ]

= pE [ cosθ_initial - cosθ_final ]

So in this case, θ_initial is 64 degrees, θ_final is 64 + 180 = 244 degrees.

But since cos(244) = cos(180 + 64) = -cos(64), because cos(180 + x) = -cos x.

So cosθ_final = cos(244) = -cos(64).

Substituting:

W = pE [ cos(64) - (-cos(64)) ] = pE [ cos64 + cos64 ] = pE * 2 cos64.

So W = 2 p E cos64.

Wait, but wait, earlier I thought the change in potential energy was 2 p E cos θ, but according to this torque integral, work done is 2 p E cosθ. So the work done by the external agent is positive, which makes sense because you're doing work against the electric field's torque.

So now, let's plug in the numbers.

p = 3.02e-25 C·m
E = 46.0 N/C
θ = 64 degrees.

First, compute cos(64 degrees). Let me get the calculator.

cos(64°) ≈ 0.4384.

So,

W = 2 * 3.02e-25 C·m * 46.0 N/C * 0.4384.

Compute step by step.

First, multiply 3.02e-25 by 46:

3.02e-25 * 46 = (3.02 * 46) * 1e-25.

3.02 *46: Let's compute that.

3 *46 = 138, 0.02*46=0.92 → 138.92.

So 3.02 *46 = 138.92 → 138.92e-25.

Now multiply by 2: 2 *138.92e-25 = 277.84e-25.

Multiply by 0.4384:

277.84e-25 * 0.4384.

Let me compute 277.84 * 0.4384.

277.84 * 0.4 = 111.136
277.84 * 0.0384 ≈ 277.84 * 0.04 = 11.1136, but 0.0384 is 0.04 -0.0016.

So 277.84 * 0.0384 = 277.84 * (0.04 - 0.0016) = 11.1136 - (277.84 * 0.0016).

277.84 * 0.0016 = 0.444544.

So 11.1136 - 0.444544 ≈ 10.669056.

So total W ≈ (111.136 + 10.669056) * 1e-25 → 121.805056e-25 J.

Wait, but wait, no. Because 277.84e-25 * 0.4384 is 277.84 * 0.4384 = let me compute that more accurately.

Alternatively, 277.84 * 0.4384 ≈ ?

Let me compute 277.84 * 0.4 = 111.136.

277.84 * 0.03 = 8.3352.

277.84 * 0.0084 = let's see:

277.84 * 0.008 = 2.22272.

277.84 * 0.0004 = 0.111136.

So 2.22272 + 0.111136 = 2.333856.

Now sum all parts:

111.136 + 8.3352 = 119.4712

119.4712 + 2.333856 ≈ 121.805056.

So 277.84 * 0.4384 ≈ 121.805056.

So W ≈ 121.805056e-25 J = 1.21805056e-23 J.

Looking at the options, option I is written as "1.22 10^{-23} J", which I think is a typo and should be 1.22e-23 J, which matches our calculation.

Wait, but looking at the options again, option I is written as "1.22$$10^{-23} J". Hmm, that's probably a mistake in the formatting. So the correct answer should be approximately 1.22e-23 J, which is option I.

But wait, let me recheck the calculation to be sure.

Wait, p=3.02e-25 C·m, E=46 N/C.

So 3.02e-25 *46 = (3.02 *46) *1e-25.

3.02*46: Let me compute that again.

46 *3 = 138, 46 *0.02=0.92 → 138.92, so 138.92e-25.

Multiply by 2: 277.84e-25.

Multiply by cos(64)=0.4384.

277.84e-25 * 0.4384 = 277.84 * 0.4384 = ?

Wait, perhaps using a calculator would be better, but I did the calculation earlier and got about 121.8e-25, which is 1.218e-23 J.

So that's approximately 1.22e-23 J, which is option I.

Wait, but looking at the options, option J is 4.88e-23, which is much higher. Option I is 1.22e-23, which matches our calculation.

But wait, let me think again about the angle. When you rotate the dipole by 180 degrees, the final angle is 244 degrees, which is equivalent to -116 degrees. So the final potential energy is U_final = -pE cos(244°) = -pE cos(-116) = -pE cos(116) because cos is even, so cos(-x)=cos x. And cos(116) is equal to -cos(64), so U_final = -pE*(-cos64) = pE cos64.

U_initial is -pE cos(64).

So ΔU = U_final - U_initial = pE cos64 - (-pE cos64) = 2 pE cos64.

So that's correct. So the work done is 2 * 3.02e-25 *46 * cos64.

Which is 2 *3.02e-25 *46 *0.4384 ≈ 1.218e-23 J.

So the correct answer is option I, 1.22e-23 J.

To determine the work required to rotate an electric dipole by \(180^\circ\) in a uniform electric field, we calculate the change in the dipole's potential energy. The potential energy of a dipole in an electric field is given by:

\[
U = -pE \cos\theta
\]

where \(p\) is the dipole moment, \(E\) is the electric field strength, and \(\theta\) is the angle between the dipole moment and the electric field. The work done \(W\) is the change in potential energy:

\[
W = U_{\text{final}} - U_{\text{initial}}
\]

### Step 1: Identify initial and final angles
- **Initial angle**: \(\theta_{\text{initial}} = 64^\circ\)
- **Final angle**: After rotating \(180^\circ\), \(\theta_{\text{final}} = 64^\circ + 180^\circ = 244^\circ\). Using the periodicity of cosine, \(\cos(244^\circ) = \cos(180^\circ + 64^\circ) = -\cos(64^\circ)\).

### Step 2: Calculate initial and final potential energies
- **Initial potential energy**:
\[
U_{\text{initial}} = -pE \cos(64^\circ)
\]
- **Final potential energy**:
\[
U_{\text{final}} = -pE \cos(244^\circ) = -pE (-\cos(64^\circ)) = pE \cos(64^\circ)
\]

### Step 3: Compute the work done
The work done is:
\[
W = U_{\text{final}} - U_{\text{initial}} = pE \cos(64^\circ) - (-pE \cos(64^\circ)) = 2pE \cos(64^\circ)
\]

### Step 4: Substitute values and calculate
Given:
- \(p = 3.02 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{C·m}\)
- \(E = 46.0 \, \text{N/C}\)
- \(\cos(64^\circ) \approx 0.4384\)

Substitute into the equation:
\[
W = 2 \times (3.02 \times 10^{-25}) \times 46.0 \times 0.4384
\]

First, calculate \(3.02 \times 46.0 = 138.92\). Then:
\[
W = 2 \times 138.92 \times 10^{-25} \times 0.4384 \approx 121.8 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{J} = 1.22 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}
\]

### Conclusion
The work required is approximately \(1.22 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}\), which corresponds to **option I**.
