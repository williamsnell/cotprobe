Okay, so I have this question about systemic circulation, and I'm supposed to pick the correct sequence from options A to J. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my anatomy, but let's try to think this through.

Systemic circulation is the part of the circulatory system that sends blood to all the body's tissues except the lungs. So it starts from the left side of the heart, right? Because the left ventricle is where the oxygenated blood is pumped out.

Wait, let me remember: the heart has four chambers. The left ventricle is the main pumping chamber that sends blood through the aorta to the rest of the body. So the sequence should start with the left ventricle. Then the aorta, which is the largest artery.

After the aorta, the blood goes into smaller arteries, which branch out into even smaller capillaries. Capillaries are where the exchange of oxygen, nutrients, and waste happens with the body's cells. Once the blood has been around the body, it becomes deoxygenated and flows into veins. Veins then carry the blood back to the heart, specifically to the right atrium.

Wait, but the question is about systemic circulation. So the path should be: left ventricle → aorta → arteries → capillaries → veins. Let me check the options.

Looking at the options:

Option I: Left ventricle → aorta → arteries → capillaries → veins. That seems right. Let's see, option I is left ventricle, then aorta, then arteries, then capillaries, then veins. That makes sense because the blood goes from large artery (aorta) to smaller arteries, then capillaries, then veins, and eventually back to the heart.

Wait, but let me double-check. Systemic circulation starts at the left ventricle, goes through the aorta, then through arteries, then capillaries, and then veins return the blood. So yes, option I seems correct.

But wait, looking at other options: option H is left ventricle → aorta → arteries → veins → capillaries. No, that's not right because the capillaries come after the arteries, not after the veins.

Option A starts with left ventricle, aorta, capillaries, arteries, veins. Hmm, no, because after aorta, it should go to arteries, not directly to capillaries. So A is incorrect.

Option E starts with left atrium, which is wrong because systemic circulation starts in the left ventricle, not the atrium. So E is out.

Option F is about the right ventricle and pulmonary circulation, so that's not systemic.

So yeah, option I seems correct.

The systemic circulation sequence begins at the left ventricle, where oxygenated blood is pumped into the aorta. From there, the blood travels through arteries, then into capillaries for gas and nutrient exchange, and finally returns to the heart via veins. Among the options, only option I correctly follows this pathway: left ventricle → aorta → arteries → capillaries → veins.
