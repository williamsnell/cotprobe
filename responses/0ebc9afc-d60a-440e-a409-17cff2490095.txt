Okay, so I've got this question about moral theories and I need to figure out which one is central to the idea of "using someone as a mere means." Hmm, let's break this down.

First, I remember that each of these theories has different core ideas. The question is asking which theory is mainly concerned with not treating people as mere means. That sounds like it's about how we should treat others with respect and not just use them for our own ends.

I think Kantianism is the one that emphasizes treating people as ends in themselves, not as means. Kant's Categorical Imperative says that we should act in a way that respects humanity in others, meaning we shouldn't treat them as tools but as valuable beings in their own right. So that makes me think option B, Kantianism, is the right answer.

Wait, but what about the other options? Utilitarianism is all about the greatest good for the greatest number. It focuses on outcomes, so sometimes that might involve using people as means if it benefits more people overall. But the question is about the theory that centrally opposes using people as means, so Utilitarianism might not be it.

Egoism is about self-interest, so that's more about individual benefit and might not directly address the means vs ends issue. Existentialism is more about personal authenticity and freedom, which doesn't directly touch on this concept. Natural law theory is about following natural principles, but I'm not sure it's specifically about treating people as ends.

Virtue ethics is about developing good character traits, but it's more about the virtues themselves rather than specific principles like means vs ends. Relativism says that moral truths are relative, so it doesn't provide a central principle against using people as means. Divine command theory is based on religious teachings, which might have their own take, but I don't think it's the primary focus here.

Hedonism is about maximizing pleasure, so again, it's outcome-focused and might allow for using people if it leads to more pleasure. Consequentialism is similar to utilitarianism in that it's outcome-based, so it's about the consequences rather than the means.

So putting it all together, Kantianism is the one that explicitly says you shouldn't use people as mere means because they have intrinsic value. Therefore, the answer should be B.

The idea of "using someone as a mere means" is centrally relevant to Kantianism, as it emphasizes treating individuals as ends in themselves rather than as tools for others' purposes. This aligns with Kant's Categorical Imperative, which advocates for respect for humanity.

Answer: B
