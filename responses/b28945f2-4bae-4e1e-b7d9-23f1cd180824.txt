Okay, so I need to find the amount of oxygen in a container. The container has a volume of 0.2 cubic meters, temperature is 70°C, and the pressure is 25 bars. The atmospheric pressure is 1 bar, but I'm not sure how that plays into this yet.

Hmm, I remember that the ideal gas law is PV = nRT, where P is pressure, V is volume, n is the number of moles, R is the gas constant, and T is temperature in Kelvin. I think I should convert Celsius to Kelvin first. So 70°C plus 273.15 is 343.15 K.

Wait, the pressure is given as 25 bars, but I think I need to convert that to Pascals because the gas constant R is often in terms of Pascals. 1 bar is 100,000 Pascals, so 25 bars would be 25 * 100,000 = 2,500,000 Pa.

The volume is 0.2 m³, which is straightforward. Now, R is 8.314 J/(mol·K). 

So plugging into PV = nRT, n = PV/(RT). Let's compute that.

PV is 2,500,000 Pa * 0.2 m³ = 500,000 J. Because 1 J = 1 Pa·m³.

Then RT is 8.314 * 343.15. Let me calculate that. 8.314 * 300 is about 2494.2, and 8.314 * 43.15 is about 359. So total around 2853.2 J/(mol).

So n = 500,000 / 2853.2 ≈ 175.27 moles.

Wait, but wait a second. I think I might have missed the atmospheric pressure. The problem says the container holds oxygen at 25 bars, but atmospheric pressure is 1 bar. Does that mean the gauge pressure is 25 bars, making absolute pressure 26 bars? Or is the pressure given absolute?

Looking back at the question: it says "25 bars" without specifying. Typically, when pressure is given in engineering contexts, unless stated otherwise, it's absolute. But sometimes, in everyday terms, it's gauge pressure. Hmm. Oh, but in gas calculations, unless specified as gauge, we take it as absolute. So maybe I should proceed with 25 bars absolute. But wait, the atmospheric pressure is 1 bar, so maybe the container is at 25 bars above atmospheric pressure, meaning absolute pressure is 26 bars. That would change the calculation.

Wait, let me think. If the container's pressure is 25 bars, and atmospheric is 1 bar, is the container's pressure absolute or gauge? The wording says "holds oxygen at 70°C and 25 bars." I think in such cases, unless stated as gauge, it's absolute. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, sometimes in some contexts, like when discussing pressure vessels, the pressure given is absolute. So perhaps I should proceed with 25 bars absolute.

Wait, but if it's a pressure above atmospheric, then it's 25 + 1 = 26 bars. But maybe the question is that the container is at 25 bars gauge, so absolute is 25 + 1 = 26. Hmm, that would mean I should recalculate with P = 26 bar, which is 2,600,000 Pa.

Wait, but the problem says "25 bars." Let me read carefully: "Calculate the amount of oxygen in the container if the atmospheric pressure is 1 bar." So perhaps the container is at 25 bars above atmospheric, so absolute pressure is 26 bars. Alternatively, maybe the container is at 25 bars, with atmospheric being 1 bar, so the oxygen is at 25 bars absolute. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, in the ideal gas law, we use absolute pressure. So if the container's pressure is 25 bars above atmospheric, the absolute pressure would be 25 + 1 = 26 bars. But the way the question is phrased, it says "25 bars" without specifying, so perhaps it's absolute. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the 25 bars is the absolute pressure, and the atmospheric is just given as context but not needed. Let me check the question again.

The question says, "Calculate the amount of oxygen in the container if the atmospheric pressure is 1 bar." Hmm, maybe the atmospheric pressure is the surrounding pressure, and the container's pressure is 25 bars above that, making absolute pressure 26 bars. So I think that's the correct approach.

So let's recalculate with P = 26 bar = 2,600,000 Pa.

Then n = (2,600,000 * 0.2) / (8.314 * 343.15) 

Compute numerator: 2,600,000 * 0.2 = 520,000 J.

Denominator: 8.314 * 343.15 ≈ let me calculate more accurately.

8 * 343.15 = 2745.2, 0.314 * 343.15 ≈ 107.8. So total about 2853 J/(mol).

So n ≈ 520,000 / 2853 ≈ let me compute that.

Well, 2853 * 182 = 2853 *180=513540, plus 2853*2=5706. So 513540 +5706=519,246. So 182 gives 519,246, which is just under 520,000. So n ≈ 182.06 moles.

Now, the molar mass of oxygen (O2) is 32 g/mol, which is 0.032 kg/mol.

So mass is n * molar mass = 182.06 * 0.032 kg.

182 * 0.032 = 5.824 kg. 0.06 *0.032=0.00192. So total ≈5.82592 kg.

Looking at the options: D is 5.8354 kg, which is very close. So I think D is the correct answer.

Wait, but let me double-check the pressure part. If the container is at 25 bar absolute, then P=25 bar, so 2,500,000 Pa. Earlier, without adding the atmospheric pressure, n would have been about 175.27 moles, leading to 175.27 * 0.032 ≈5.61 kg. But that's not one of the options. So perhaps the correct approach is to take the 25 bars as absolute, without adding atmospheric pressure.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me clarify: when the problem states the container holds oxygen at 25 bars, it's referring to absolute pressure. So the atmospheric pressure is 1 bar, but that's not part of the container's pressure. So the container's pressure is 25 bars absolute.

So then P=25 bar=2,500,000 Pa.

n = (2,500,000 * 0.2) / (8.314 * 343.15) 

So numerator=500,000 J.

Denominator=8.314*343.15= let's compute that accurately.

343.15 *8=2745.2, 343.15 *0.314= let's compute 343.15 *0.3=102.945, 343.15 *0.014=4.8041. So total 102.945 +4.8041=107.7491. So total denominator=2745.2 +107.7491=2852.9491 ≈2852.95 J/mol.

n=500,000 /2852.95≈approx 175.27 moles.

Mass=175.27 *0.032 kg=5.60864 kg≈5.609 kg.

Looking at the options, the closest is option D:5.8354 kg and option G:3.8354 kg. But 5.609 isn't exactly matching any option. Hmmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck.

n = (2,500,000 * 0.2) / (8.314 * 343.15)

=500,000 / (8.314 * 343.15)

Compute denominator: 8.314 *343.15.

Let me calculate 8 *343.15=2745.2

0.314 *343.15:

343.15 *0.3 =102.945

343.15 *0.014=4.8041

Total:102.945 +4.8041=107.7491

So total denominator=2745.2 +107.7491=2852.9491.

500,000 /2852.9491 ≈175.268 moles.

Mass:175.268 *32 g/mol=5,608.58 g=5.60858 kg≈5.609 kg.

Looking at the options, none exactly match. The options are A:4.234, B:4.8354, C:5.234, D:5.8354, etc. So 5.609 is closest to option D:5.8354, but it's a bit lower. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the pressure.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the pressure is given in gauge, so absolute pressure is 25 +1=26 bar. Let's try that.

P=26 bar=2,600,000 Pa.

n=(2,600,000 *0.2)/(8.314*343.15)

=520,000 /2852.9491≈182.07 moles.

Mass=182.07 *32 g=5826.24 g=5.82624 kg≈5.826 kg.

Looking at the options, D is 5.8354 kg, which is very close. So that must be the correct approach. So the answer is D.

To determine the amount of oxygen in the container, we use the ideal gas law:

\[
PV = nRT
\]

Where:
- \( P \) is the pressure in Pascals (Pa),
- \( V \) is the volume in cubic meters (m³),
- \( n \) is the number of moles,
- \( R \) is the gas constant (\( 8.314 \, \text{J/(mol·K)} \)),
- \( T \) is the temperature in Kelvin (K).

### Step 1: Convert temperature to Kelvin
\[
T = 70^\circ \text{C} + 273.15 = 343.15 \, \text{K}
\]

### Step 2: Convert pressure to Pascals
The container's pressure is given as \( 25 \, \text{bars} \). Since \( 1 \, \text{bar} = 100,000 \, \text{Pa} \):
\[
P = 25 \times 100,000 = 2,500,000 \, \text{Pa}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the number of moles (\( n \))
Rearranging the ideal gas law:
\[
n = \frac{PV}{RT}
\]
Substitute the values:
\[
n = \frac{(2,500,000 \, \text{Pa})(0.2 \, \text{m}^3)}{(8.314 \, \text{J/(mol·K)})(343.15 \, \text{K})}
\]
Calculate the numerator:
\[
PV = 2,500,000 \times 0.2 = 500,000 \, \text{J}
\]
Calculate the denominator:
\[
RT = 8.314 \times 343.15 \approx 2852.95 \, \text{J/mol}
\]
Thus:
\[
n = \frac{500,000}{2852.95} \approx 175.27 \, \text{mol}
\]

### Step 4: Convert moles to mass
The molar mass of oxygen (\( O_2 \)) is \( 32 \, \text{g/mol} \) or \( 0.032 \, \text{kg/mol} \). The mass of oxygen is:
\[
\text{Mass} = n \times \text{Molar Mass} = 175.27 \times 0.032 \approx 5.61 \, \text{kg}
\]

### Step 5: Reassess pressure interpretation
If the container's pressure is \( 25 \, \text{bars} \) above atmospheric pressure (gauge pressure), the absolute pressure is:
\[
P_{\text{absolute}} = 25 + 1 = 26 \, \text{bars} = 2,600,000 \, \text{Pa}
\]
Recalculate \( n \) with \( P = 2,600,000 \, \text{Pa} \):
\[
n = \frac{(2,600,000 \times 0.2)}{2852.95} \approx 182.07 \, \text{mol}
\]
Calculate the mass:
\[
\text{Mass} = 182.07 \times 0.032 \approx 5.83 \, \text{kg}
\]

### Final Answer
The closest option to \( 5.83 \, \text{kg} \) is **D: 5.8354 kg**.

\[
\boxed{D}
