Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about calculating the recoil energy of an atom. Let me try to break it down step by step. Hmm, the question says the atom has a mass of 10, and it emits a 2 MeV gamma ray. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I remember it's about conservation of energy and momentum.

Wait, wait, gamma rays are photons, right? So when the atom emits a photon, the atom itself recoils because of the momentum carried by the photon. Since momentum has to be conserved, the atom will move in the opposite direction of the photon's emission. But how do I find the recoil energy?

I think the key here is to use the equation that relates the energy of the photon to the recoil energy of the atom. I remember something about the atom's kinetic energy being equal to (m^2 * c^4) divided by (2E_photon), but I'm not too sure. Let me think again.

Oh right, when a nucleus emits a photon, the recoil energy (E_r) can be found using the formula E_r = (E_γ^2) / (2 m c^2), but wait, I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe it's E_r = (E_γ^2) / (2 m c^2), but I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, I recall that the kinetic energy of the recoiling atom is given by (E_γ)^2 / (2 m c^2), but I'm not certain about the exact formula.

Wait, let's get the units right. The mass is given as 10, but I think the units here are atomic mass units (u), since that's common in such problems. So m = 10 u. Also, the energy of the photon is 2 MeV.

I remember that 1 u is approximately 931.5 MeV/c². So the mass energy equivalence would be m c² = 10 u * 931.5 MeV/u = 9315 MeV. Wait, but that's a lot bigger than the photon energy, so maybe the recoil energy is small compared to that.

Now, the formula I think is E_r = (E_γ)^2 / (2 m c²). Plugging in the numbers: E_γ is 2 MeV, m is 10 u, and c² is in MeV/u units. So m c² is 9315 MeV as I calculated earlier.

Wait, but in the formula, I think it's E_r = (E_γ)^2 / (2 m c²). So substituting the values, E_r = (2)^2 / (2 * 10 * 931.5) in MeV. Let me compute that.

(2)^2 is 4. Denominator is 2*10*931.5 = 20 * 931.5 = 18630. So E_r = 4 / 18630 ≈ 0.0002143 MeV. Oh wait, that can't be right because the options are in much larger numbers, like 75ev, 250ev, etc.

Wait, I must have messed up the units somewhere. Let me check again. Maybe I should calculate it in terms of eV.

Since 1 u is 931.5 MeV/c², then 10 u is 9315 MeV/c². But E_γ is 2 MeV. So plugging into E_r = (2 MeV)^2 / (2 * 10 u * c²) ) = (4 MeV²) / (20 u c²). But wait, u c² is 931.5 MeV, so denominator is 20 * 931.5 MeV = 18630 MeV.

So E_r = 4 / 18630 MeV ≈ 0.0002143 MeV. To convert that to eV, since 1 MeV is 1e6 eV, so 0.0002143 MeV is 214.3 eV. Looking at the options, option D is 214ev. That's close. So the answer should be around 214 eV.

Wait, but let me think again. Is the formula correct? Because sometimes, the recoil energy is given by E_r = (E_photon)^2 / (2 m c^2), but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe I should use the relation between momentum and energy.

The photon's momentum is E_photon / c. The atom's momentum is m v, where v is its velocity. So conservation of momentum gives m v = E_photon / c. The kinetic energy of the atom is (1/2) m v².

So let's compute that. From momentum conservation, m v = E_photon / c → v = (E_photon)/(c m). Then, KE = (1/2) m v² = (1/2) m (E_photon/(c m))^2 = (E_photon^2)/(2 m c²).

So yes, the formula E_r = (E_γ)^2 / (2 m c²) is correct. So plugging in the numbers, E_r is (2)^2 / (2 *10 *931.5) MeV. Wait, earlier I did 4 / (20 *931.5) → 4/18630 ≈ 0.0002143 MeV = 214.3 eV, which matches option D: 214ev.

So the correct answer should be D.

The recoil energy of the atom is calculated using the formula \( E_r = \frac{E_\gamma^2}{2 m c^2} \), where \( E_\gamma \) is the energy of the emitted gamma ray, \( m \) is the mass of the atom, and \( c \) is the speed of light. Given that \( m = 10 \, \text{u} \) and \( E_\gamma = 2 \, \text{MeV} \), we substitute these values into the formula. Since \( 1 \, \text{u} \approx 931.5 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \), the mass-energy term \( m c^2 \) becomes \( 10 \times 931.5 = 9315 \, \text{MeV} \). Substituting into the formula gives:

\[
E_r = \frac{(2)^2}{2 \times 10 \times 931.5} = \frac{4}{18630} \approx 0.0002143 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

Converting this to electron volts (\( 1 \, \text{MeV} = 10^6 \, \text{eV} \)):

\[
E_r \approx 0.0002143 \times 10^6 = 214.3 \, \text{eV}.
\]

This matches option D: 214 eV.
