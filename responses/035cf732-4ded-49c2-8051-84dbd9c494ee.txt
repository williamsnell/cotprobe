Question:

Can a stream cipher have perfect secrecy?

Options:

A: Yes, if the PRG is really “secure”
B: No, because perfect secrecy is not possible in any cipher
C: Yes, if the stream cipher is implemented correctly
D: No, since the key is shorter than the message
E: Yes, every cipher has perfect secrecy
F: Yes, if the key is longer than the message
G: No, only block ciphers can have perfect secrecy
H: Yes, if the key is used only once
I: No, since the key is reused for the stream cipher
J: No, there are no ciphers with perfect secrecy

Okay, so I need to figure out whether a stream cipher can have perfect secrecy. Hmm, I remember that perfect secrecy means that the ciphertext provides no information about the plaintext, right? Like, the ciphertext alone doesn't help in figuring out what the original message was. 

Stream ciphers work by taking a key and a pseudorandom generator (PRG) to produce a keystream. This keystream is then XORed with the plaintext to get the ciphertext. For perfect secrecy, the keystream needs to be completely random and never reused. Wait, isn't that similar to the one-time pad, which is known for having perfect secrecy?

So, if the stream cipher uses a one-time pad method, where the key is as long as the message and is used only once, then yes, it can achieve perfect secrecy. But if the key is shorter and reused, like in many stream ciphers, then it's not secure. 

Looking at the options, option H says "Yes, if the key is used only once." That makes sense because the one-time pad is a type of stream cipher and it requires the key to be used just once. So if the key isn't reused, the stream cipher can be perfectly secure.

Other options: Option A says it's yes if the PRG is secure. But even a secure PRG doesn't ensure perfect secrecy because the key might be reused. Option D says the key is shorter than the message, which is often the case, but that doesn't negate the possibility when the key is used once and as long as the message. Option F says if the key is longer than the message, which isn't necessary; the key just needs to be as long and used once. Option I says no because the key is reused, which is a problem, but the question is whether it's possible, not whether it's done in practice. So the answer is H.

The correct answer is H: Yes, if the key is used only once. Stream ciphers, particularly when implemented as one-time pads, can achieve perfect secrecy if the key is used once and is as long as the message. 

Answer: H
