Okay, so I've got this question about afterimages, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me think through this step by step.

Curtis is staring at a yellow star for a full minute. Then he moves his gaze to a blank white paper. The question is about the color of the afterimage he'll see. The options are A to J, with colors like orange, pink, brown, etc.

First, I remember that afterimages occur because the eye's photoreceptors get fatigued. When you stare at a color, the cones responsible for that color become tired. So when you look at a white or neutral background, those tired cones don't respond as much, and the opposing cones kick in, creating the afterimage.

Yellow is a primary color, but I think in terms of afterimages, it's paired with its complementary color. Wait, what's the complementary color of yellow? I think it's purple because when you mix yellow and purple, you get a neutral gray. But wait, I might be mixing this up. Let me think again.

The color wheel: primary colors are red, blue, and yellow. The complementary colors are across from each other. So yellow's complement is violet or purple. So if Curtis stares at yellow, the afterimage should be purple. Let me check the options. Option F is purple.

But wait, sometimes people confuse the afterimage with the direct color. So when you look at a white background after a yellow, the eye's yellow-sensitive cones are fatigued, so the opposing color (which would be blue and red combined, hence purple) appears.

Alternatively, another way to think about it is using the RGB color model. Yellow is a combination of red and green. So if you stare at red and green, their cones get tired, and the afterimage would be the remaining color, which is blue. Wait, that's conflicting with my earlier thought.

Wait, no, because in the eye, the cones are for red, green, and blue. So if you look at yellow, which is red + green, those cones get fatigued. The afterimage would be the complement, which is blue. Because when red and green are gone, blue is what's left. Wait, but I'm getting confused now.

Wait, let me clarify. The complementary color is determined by subtractive color mixing. So if you have yellow, the complementary is blue because yellow and blue don't mix to make white but instead make green or other colors. But wait, in color theory, the complementary colors are those that, when mixed, produce a neutral color. So yellow and purple.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the actual afterimage phenomenon. When you stare at a color and then look at a white background, the afterimage is the color that, when mixed with the original, gives white. So if the original is yellow, the afterimage should be the color that when combined with yellow makes white. But yellow is a primary color, so to get white, you'd need the other two primary colors? No, wait, white is the combination of all three primary colors.

Alternatively, in terms of afterimages, the afterimage color is the one that the eye perceives when the original color's cones are fatigued. So if you look at yellow, which is a combination of red and green, the cones for red and green get tired. The afterimage would then be the activation of the blue cones, since blue is the third primary. So the afterimage would appear as blue.

But wait, I'm getting conflicting thoughts. Another way: I remember that the afterimage of a color is its complement. So if yellow's complement is purple, then the afterimage should be purple. But I'm also recalling that the afterimage of a color is the color that when added together with the original gives white. So if yellow is present, the afterimage would be blue because yellow plus blue makes white? Wait, no, yellow plus blue makes green. Hmm, maybe that's not the right approach.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the RGB color model. In RGB, each color has a complementary color that, when combined, results in white. So the complementary color of yellow (which is R+G) would be B because R+G+B = white. So if you have R+G (yellow), the complementary is B. So the afterimage would be blue.

Wait, but I'm getting conflicting information. Let me try to recall examples. For instance, if you stare at a red dot, the afterimage is green. Because red and green are complements. So if red's afterimage is green, then yellow's afterimage should be the complement of yellow, which is purple. Because in the RGB model, the complement of red is green, blue's complement is yellow, and perhaps yellow's complement is purple. Or wait, maybe I'm mixing subtractive and additive color models.

Wait, in the subtractive color model (like used in printing), the primary colors are CMYK. So the complementary colors are different. But in the additive model (RGB), the complementary colors are different. I think the afterimage is based on the additive model because the eye works with RGB.

Wait, let me get this straight. In the additive RGB model, the primary colors are red, green, and blue. The complementary colors are those that are opposite on the color wheel. So red's complement is cyan, green's is magenta, and blue's is yellow. Wait, no, that can't be right because in RGB, the complement of red is cyan, which is not an option here.

Wait, maybe I'm confusing the RGB model with the traditional color wheel. Let me think: traditional color wheel complements are red-green, blue-orange, yellow-purple. So if yellow's complement is purple, then the afterimage of yellow should be purple.

But earlier I thought that the afterimage would be blue because looking at R+G (yellow) would tire those cones, leaving B, which is blue. So which is correct?

Alternatively, maybe I should think of the afterimage as the color that when viewed on a white background, it's the opposite. So if you look at yellow, which is high in red and green, the afterimage would be high in blue, which is the opposite. So blue would be the afterimage.

Wait, but I'm getting conflicting thoughts between traditional color theory and the RGB model. I think in the context of the question, it's more about traditional color theory where yellow's complement is purple. So the afterimage would be purple, which is option F.

But wait, another way: when you stare at a color, the cones for that color get fatigued. So if you look at yellow, which is red plus green, those cones are tired. When you look at white, which has all colors, the tired red and green cones don't respond, so the remaining blue cones are more active, making the afterimage appear blue.

Wait, that makes sense. So if the cones for red and green are fatigued, the blue cones are more active, so the afterimage is blue. So the answer would be I: blue.

But now I'm confused because I thought the complement was purple. Hmm.

Wait, let me think of another example. If you look at red, the afterimage is green. Because red's complement is green in traditional color theory. But in RGB, red's complement is cyan, but perhaps in the eye's case, it's green because when you tire the red cones, the green cones are more active, making the afterimage green.

So applying that logic, looking at yellow (red + green) would tire both red and green cones. So the remaining active cones are blue, making the afterimage blue.

So in that case, the afterimage would be blue, which is option I.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Some sources say that the afterimage of yellow is purple. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should look up how afterimages work. Afterimages occur due to the eye's photoreceptor fatigue. Each color has an afterimage that is its complement. The complement is determined by the color that, when viewed together, produce a neutral color.

In traditional color theory, the complementary colors are:

Red - Green

Blue - Orange

Yellow - Purple

So if you look at yellow, the afterimage should be purple.

But in the RGB model, the complementary color is the combination that adds up to white. So yellow (R+G) would have a complementary color of B, which is blue.

I think the confusion arises from whether we're using traditional color theory or the RGB model.

In the context of the question, since it's about what you see when you look at a white background after staring at a color, it's more about the eye's response, which is based on the RGB model. So the afterimage would be the color that the eye perceives when the original color's cones are fatigued.

So yellow is R+G. So the afterimage would be B, which is blue.

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident. Another way: if you look at a red square, the afterimage is green. Because red is R, so the afterimage is G. Similarly, looking at blue would give an afterimage of yellow (since blue is B, the afterimage would be R+G = yellow).

So following that logic, looking at yellow (R+G) would give an afterimage of B, which is blue.

So the answer should be I: blue.

But earlier I thought it was purple, which is the traditional complement. So which is it?

I think in the context of the eye's response, it's based on the RGB model, so the afterimage of yellow is blue.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should think of a real-life example. If I look at a yellow object, then look at a white wall, do I see blue or purple?

I think I've heard before that the afterimage of yellow is blue. For example, if you look at a yellow wall and then look at white, you might see a blue afterimage.

So putting it all together, the afterimage should be blue, which is option I.

Curtis stares at a yellow star for a full minute, causing his eye's photoreceptors, particularly those sensitive to red and green, to become fatigued. When he shifts his gaze to a blank white paper, the tired red and green cones are less active, leaving the blue cones more responsive. This results in the perception of a blue afterimage.
