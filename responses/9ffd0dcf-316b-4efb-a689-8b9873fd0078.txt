Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me see what it's about. The question is about an autosomal recessive trait expressed in 1% of the population. We're told to assume Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, and we need to find out what percent of the population are carriers but don't express the trait. The options are from A to J, and I need to choose the correct one.

Alright, let's start by recalling what I know about Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The Hardy-Weinberg principle states that in a population, the distribution of alleles and genotypes remains constant across generations if certain conditions are met, like no mutation, random mating, no migration, no selection, and a large population size.

For an autosomal recessive trait, the expression (phenotype) only occurs in homozygous recessive individuals. So, if the trait is expressed in 1% of the population, that corresponds to the q² term in the Hardy-Weinberg equation. The equation is p² + 2pq + q² = 1, where q² is the frequency of the recessive homozygote (expressing the trait), p² is the dominant homozygote, and 2pq are the heterozygotes (carriers).

Given that the trait is expressed in 1% of the population, q² equals 0.01. So, q is the square root of 0.01, which is 0.1. That means q, the frequency of the recessive allele, is 0.1.

Since p is the frequency of the dominant allele, and p + q = 1, then p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.1 = 0.9.

Now, the carriers are the heterozygotes, which are 2pq. So plugging in the numbers: 2 * 0.9 * 0.1 = 0.18, which is 18%. Wait, but wait a second. Let me make sure I'm doing this right.

Wait, no, that's 18%, but wait, the options include 18% as option J. But let me think again. Oh, wait, wait a minute. Wait, no, because 2pq is indeed 0.18, so 18% of the population are carriers. But the question is asking for the percent of carriers who don't express the trait. Wait, but wait, carriers don't express the trait because they're heterozygous. So the carriers are the 2pq group, which is 18%, so that's the answer. But wait, let me double-check.

Wait, but wait, no. No, wait. The question says "what percent of the population are carriers but do not express the trait." Since carriers are heterozygotes, they don't express the recessive trait. So the carriers are the 2pq group, which is 0.18 or 18%. So the correct answer is J:18%. But wait, looking back at the options, option J is 18%. So that should be the answer.

The correct answer is J: 18%.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - An autosomal recessive trait is expressed in 1% of the population.
   - We need to find the percentage of carriers (heterozygotes) who do not express the trait.
   - Assume Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium applies.

2. **Apply Hardy-Weinberg Equation:**
   - The equation is \( p^2 + 2pq + q^2 = 1 \), where:
     - \( q^2 \) = frequency of recessive homozygotes (expressing the trait).
     - \( p^2 \) = frequency of dominant homozygotes.
     - \( 2pq \) = frequency of heterozygotes (carriers).

3. **Calculate \( q \):**
   - Given \( q^2 = 1\% = 0.01 \), so \( q = \sqrt{0.01} = 0.1 \).

4. **Find \( p \):**
   - Since \( p + q = 1 \), \( p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.1 = 0.9 \).

5. **Calculate Carriers (\( 2pq \)):**
   - \( 2pq = 2 \times 0.9 \times 0.1 = 0.18 \) or 18%.

6. **Interpret the Result:**
   - Carriers do not express the recessive trait, so 18% of the population are carriers.

**Answer:** J
