Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here about flower length in two plant strains. Hmm, the question says that the variation is due to a specific number of polygenes. I remember polygenes are when multiple genes contribute to a single trait. So I think I need to figure out how many genes are involved based on the data provided.

Looking at the data, there are four groups: Strain A, Strain B, F1 (A × B), and F2 (F1 × F1). Each has a mean flower length and a variance. The cause of variation is also noted as either environment or genes and environment.

I'm a bit rusty on this, but I think when you cross two strains, the F1 would have a mean that's somewhere in the middle if the traits are additive. Let me check the means. Strain A is 21 mm, Strain B is 39 mm. The F1 is 30 mm, which is exactly the midpoint. So that makes sense for a simple Mendelian cross where each parent contributes one allele, maybe assuming additive effects.

But then the F2 has the same mean as F1, 30 mm. Wait, that's interesting. In typical Mendelian inheritance, like in a self of F1, you get a distribution around the mean, but the mean itself stays the same. But in this case, the variance increases. F1 has a variance of 1.80, and F2 jumps to 5.10. I think variance in F2 usually increases when there's segregation of alleles in the F2 generation because you get more variation among the offspring.

Wait, but how does that relate to the number of genes? Oh, right! When dealing with multiple genes (polygenes), the variance can be modeled using the concept of heritability and the number of genes involved. I remember something about the broad-sense heritability, which accounts for all genetic variance (both additive and non-additive). But maybe in this case, since it's polygenic, we can use the formula that relates F2 variance to the number of genes.

Alternatively, I think there's a method where the variance in F2 can be used to estimate the number of genes. In a typical case with one gene, the F2 variance would be higher because of the segregation. But with multiple genes, each contributing a small effect, the variance would add up.

Wait, another approach: The data shows that in F1, the variance is higher than in the parent strains. Strain A has variance 1.43, Strain B 1.16. The F1 is 1.80, which is higher than both. Then, F2 is 5.10. I think when you have a cross of two inbred lines, the F1 is heterotic (maybe higher mean), but the variance in F1 might be due to environment. But in F2, the variance increases because of the genetic variation from the selfing or crossing F1 plants, which have multiple alleles segregating.

Wait, another thought: The variance in F2 can be used to estimate the genetic variance component. I've heard of the formula where the variance in F2 is related to the number of genes. For a single gene, in F2, the variance would be higher, but for multiple genes, each contributing a fraction, the total variance would be additive.

I think the formula for the variance in F2 under polygenic inheritance is something like s² = 2p(1-p) * sum of (h² * σ²_i), where h² is the heritability for each gene. But I'm not sure if that's the right approach here.

Wait, perhaps a simpler approach: In a diallelic system (two alleles), the variance in F2 is higher. For multiple genes, each gene contributes to the total variance. Maybe I can use the fact that the F2 variance is 5.10, and compare it to the F1 variance to find the number of genes.

Alternatively, if I think about the F1 as having a certain number of heterozygous loci, each contributing to the variance. When F1 is selfed, each locus segregates, contributing to the F2 variance. So maybe the F2 variance is due to the sum of variances from each gene.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The F1 has a certain mean, and when selfed, the F2 will have a mean of the same as F1 (since it's a cross of F1 × F1). But the variance increases due to segregation. The formula for variance in F2 when considering multiple genes might involve the number of genes and their individual variances.

Another thought: The variance in F2 is 5.10, which is much higher than F1's 1.80. The F1 is a hybrid, so maybe it's heterozygous at multiple loci. When selfed, each locus segregates, increasing the variance.

I think the number of genes can be estimated by the ratio of F2 variance to F1 variance. Wait, but F1 is a hybrid, so its variance might not be just genetic but also environmental. Hmm, but the problem says that the variation is due to polygenes, so maybe the environmental variance isn't the focus here.

Wait, another approach: The formula for the expected variance in F2 under a polygenic model is:

s²_F2 = (2n p(1-p)) * (h² * σ²_i)

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, for each gene, the variance contributed in F2 is 2p(1-p) * variance per gene. If all genes are additive and equally effective, the total variance would be the sum of each gene's variance.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the F2 variance is the sum of the variances from each gene. If each gene contributes a certain amount, say, in F2, each gene has a variance of 1 (or some value), then the total number of genes would be variance divided by per-gene variance.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think of a different angle. The F2 variance is 5.10, which is higher than F1's 1.80. Maybe the increase in variance from F1 to F2 can be used to find the number of genes. The F1 is a hybrid, and when you self it, each gene segregates, contributing to the variance.

Assuming that each gene in F1 is heterozygous, and when F1 is selfed, each gene has a segregation variance. The segregation variance per gene is p(1-p) for each allele. If we assume p=0.5 for each gene (since F1 is a hybrid), then segregation variance per gene is 0.25.

But wait, the F2 variance is 5.10. So if each gene contributes 0.25 to the variance, the number of genes would be 5.10 / 0.25 = 20.4, which is approximately 20 genes. Looking at the options, E is 20 gene pairs. But wait, the options are in gene pairs, so perhaps I need to double that because each gene has two alleles? Or maybe gene pairs refer to loci, each with two alleles.

Wait, but polygenes are multiple loci, each with two alleles. So maybe the number of loci is what we're being asked, not the number of alleles. So if each locus contributes 0.25 to the variance, and the total is 5.10, then number of loci is 5.10 / 0.25 = 20.4, approximately 20. So option E is 20 gene pairs.

But wait, why are the options given as gene pairs? Maybe because each gene has two alleles, so each pair refers to an allele pair at a locus. So each gene is counted as a pair. So 20 gene pairs would mean 20 loci, each with two alleles.

Alternatively, another approach: The F2 variance can be used to estimate the genetic variance component. The formula for the broad-sense heritability (H²) is the genetic variance (Vg) divided by the phenotypic variance (Vp). But in this case, maybe all the variance is genetic because the environment is the same across groups? Or is the environment contributing?

Wait, the problem states that the variation is due to polygenes, so perhaps the environmental variance isn't the main factor here. But looking at the data, Strain A and B have variances of 1.43 and 1.16, which I think are the environmental variances because the cause is listed as environment for Strain A and B. The F1 has a higher variance, 1.80, which might include both genetic and environmental factors. F2 has 5.10, which is likely higher due to genetic factors as well.

Hmm, maybe I need to use the formula for the variance in F2 in terms of the number of genes. I've read that in a polygenic model, the variance in F2 can be calculated as s² = (number of genes) * (average effect per gene)^2 * 2pq, assuming additive effects and p=q=0.5.

Wait, but without knowing the average effect per gene, it's hard to apply that formula directly. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the fact that the F2 variance is 5.10, which is higher than F1's 1.80, and the ratio can give the number of genes.

Wait, another approach: The formula for the variance in F2 is given by:

V(F2) = (V(F1) × (number of genes)) + ... Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, I remember that in a diallelic case, the variance in F2 is higher than in F1. For a single gene, F1 would have variance based on dominance, but F2 would have higher variance due to segregation. But with multiple genes, each adds a small variance.

Wait, maybe the F2 variance is the sum of the variances from each gene. If I can find the variance per gene, then number of genes = V(F2) / variance per gene.

Assuming that each gene contributes an equal amount, then variance per gene would be V per gene = V(F2) / n_genes.

But without knowing the per-gene variance, I need another approach. Maybe the F1 variance is related to the number of genes. The F1 is a hybrid, so its variance might be due to dominance effects.

Wait, the F1 variance is 1.80, which is higher than the parent strains. Maybe that's due to heterosis or dominance variance. But I'm not sure how that ties into the number of genes.

Alternatively, perhaps the change in variance from F1 to F2 can be used. The F1 variance is 1.80, F2 is 5.10. The increase is 3.3. Maybe that's due to the segregation in F2, which introduces more genetic variance.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me think of another angle. The mean of F1 is 30, same as F2, so the increase in variance is purely genetic. The F2 variance is 5.10, which is higher than F1's 1.80. So the additional variance is 3.3. If each gene adds a certain amount of variance, then 3.3 divided by per-gene variance equals the number of genes.

But again, without knowing per-gene variance, this is tricky. Maybe each gene contributes an average of 0.165 to the variance (3.3 / 20), which would suggest 20 genes. So 20 gene pairs, which is option E.

Wait, but why 20? Because 3.3 divided by 0.165 is 20. So if each gene adds 0.165, then 20 genes would account for 3.3, which plus F1's 1.80 gives F2's 5.10. So the number of genes would be about 20.

Looking at the options, E is 20 gene pairs. So I think the answer is E.

The problem involves estimating the number of polygenes contributing to flower length variation in plant strains. The data includes means and variances for Strain A, Strain B, F1 (A × B), and F2 (F1 × F1). The key observation is that the F2 variance (5.10) is significantly higher than the F1 variance (1.80), suggesting an increase in genetic variance due to segregation in the F2 generation. 

To estimate the number of genes, the increase in variance from F1 to F2 (3.3) is considered. Assuming each gene contributes equally to the variance, the number of genes can be approximated by dividing the total increase in variance by the variance per gene. If each gene contributes approximately 0.165 to the variance, then the number of genes is roughly 20. This aligns with option E, which represents 20 gene pairs.

Answer: E
