Question:

Two co-defendants were investment brokers at a bank. They had been employed by the bank for ten years. One day, they were unexpectedly fired by the bank's new manager. Apparently, the co-defendants' investments had not been performing well in the economic downturn. The co-defendants, upset and humiliated by their firing, vowed to get back at the bank. As their revenge, they decided to plant a bomb in the bank and demand $2,000,000. After receiving the money, they would then reveal the location of the bomb and provide details for defusing it. The co-defendants agreed that the bank should be given adequate warning so that nobody would be injured. In accordance with their plan, the co-defendants consulted the Internet, where they found all the information they needed on how to build a bomb. They built the bomb and placed it in a supply closet. Shortly thereafter, they phoned the bank and made a demand for the money. They said a bomb was in the bank and that it would explode in 24 hours unless the money was paid. The bank refused to pay the money. Realizing that their plan had gone awry, they drove to the bank to attempt to defuse the bomb. As they were driving back to the bank, the bomb exploded, killing 30 people. If the co-defendants are charged with murder and conspiracy to commit murder, which of the following statements is correct?

Options:

A: Only the co-defendant who made the phone call is guilty of murder, but both are guilty of conspiracy to commit murder.
B: Both co-defendants are guilty of murder and conspiracy to commit murder.
C: Both co-defendants are guilty of conspiracy to commit murder, but not murder.
D: Both co-defendants are not guilty of murder and conspiracy to commit murder.
E: Both co-defendants are guilty of felony murder, but neither is guilty of conspiracy to commit murder.
F: Both co-defendants are guilty of felony murder, and only one is guilty of conspiracy to commit murder.
G: Only the co-defendant who placed the bomb is guilty of felony murder and conspiracy to commit murder.
H: Only the co-defendant who made the phone call is guilty of felony murder and conspiracy to commit murder.
I: Both co-defendants are guilty of conspiracy to commit murder, and only one is guilty of murder.
J: Only the co-defendant who placed the bomb is guilty of murder, but both are guilty of conspiracy to commit murder.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this law question about co-defendants being charged with murder and conspiracy. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the facts: Two investment brokers were fired and decided to get revenge by planting a bomb in the bank. They wanted $2 million, and after getting it, they'd reveal the bomb's location and defusing details. They planned to warn the bank so no one would be injured. They built the bomb, placed it, called the bank, and demanded money. The bank refused, so they went to defuse it but the bomb exploded, killing 30 people.

The charges are murder and conspiracy to commit murder. I need to figure out which option is correct.

I remember that conspiracy requires an agreement between two or more people to commit a crime, and each has to intend the commission of the crime. Here, both co-defendants agreed to plant the bomb, so they both are guilty of conspiracy to commit murder.

Now, about the murder charge. They intended to plant the bomb but planned to warn the bank so no one would be hurt. However, the bomb exploded before they could defuse it, killing 30. I think about the different types of murder. There's intentional murder, which requires intent to kill, and felony murder, which happens during the commission of a felony, even if not intending to kill.

In this case, planting the bomb was a felony (like arson or explosive use), so when the bomb exploded, it could be felony murder. Both co-defendants are part of the felony, so both could be guilty of felony murder.

Wait, but did they intend for the bomb to go off? They wanted to get the money and then defuse it, so maybe they didn't intend immediate death. But felony murder doesn't require intent; it's about the commission of a felony that inherently dangerous to human life. Planting a bomb is such a felony.

So, both are guilty of conspiracy to commit murder because they agreed to plant the bomb. They're also guilty of felony murder because the bomb caused deaths during the commission of the felony (planting the bomb).

Looking at the options:

A: Only the caller guilty of murder. No, because both are part of the felony.

B: Both guilty of murder and conspiracy. This fits because felony murder applies to both, and they conspired.

C: Both guilty of conspiracy but not murder. No, because they caused deaths through the felony.

D: Neither guilty. Wrong.

E: Felony murder, not conspiracy. No, they did conspire.

F: Felony murder, only one conspiracy. No, both conspired.

G: Only bombplacer guilty of felony murder and conspiracy. No, both are.

H: Only caller guilty. No.

I: Both conspiracy, only one murder. No, both caused death.

J: Only bombplacer guilty of murder, both conspiracy. No, both are guilty of felony murder.

So, the correct answer is B: Both are guilty of murder and conspiracy to commit murder.

The co-defendants both conspired to commit murder by agreeing to plant the bomb, a felony inherently dangerous to human life. The explosion, causing 30 deaths, constitutes felony murder, applicable to both as they were part of the felony. Thus, both are guilty of both charges.

Answer: B
