Okay, so I have this question about social psychology principles, and I'm trying to figure out which one applies here. Let me read the question again: A nonprofit environmental group includes a free gift of address labels in a letter asking for contributions. Which principle are they using to increase contributions?

Hmm, I remember that social psychology has various concepts related to influencing behavior. Let me go through the options one by one.

Option A: Compliance strategy. Compliance strategies are techniques used to get people to agree to requests. Examples include the door-in-the-face technique or the foot-in-the-door technique. The idea is that if you start with a small request, people are more likely to agree to a larger one later because they've already complied once. So in this case, the nonprofit is giving something free (address labels) as a prelude to asking for a contribution. That sounds like the foot-in-the-door approach, which is a compliance strategy. So A might be a contender.

Option B: Confirmation bias. That's when people favor information that confirms their existing beliefs. I don't think the nonprofit is trying to confirm any beliefs here; they're trying to get a response, so probably not B.

Option C: Social loafing. This is when people exert less effort when working in a group because they think others will pick up the slack. Doesn't seem relevant here since the nonprofit is addressing individuals, not groups working together.

Option D: Self-fulfilling prophecy. That's when a belief leads to its own fulfillment because of actions taken based on that belief. Not sure how that applies here. They're not predicting something that then comes true.

Option E: Groupthink. That's when a group makes decisions that are uncritical because they prioritize harmony over discussion. Again, not relevant here as it's about individual response.

Option F: Stable attribution. That relates to how people attribute causes to events, either stable (internal, consistent) or unstable (external, temporary). Not sure how that ties in.

Option G: Cognitive dissonance. This is the discomfort people feel when holding conflicting thoughts, leading them to change their behavior or beliefs. If someone accepts the address labels, maybe they feel they should contribute to avoid dissonance. Possible, but let's see other options.

Option H: Halo effect. This is when a person's positive trait leads others to assume other positive traits. Like thinking someone is good at their job because they're good-looking. Not sure how that applies here.

Option I: Bystander effect. This is when people don't help because they think others will. Not relevant because the nonprofit is directly asking, not relying on others to act.

Option J: Fundamental attribution error. This is when people overemphasize internal traits and underestimate external factors when explaining others' behavior. Maybe not directly applicable here.

So back to A: Compliance strategy. The foot-in-the-door technique involves giving a small gift to make the person more agreeable to a larger request later. By giving free address labels, the nonprofit is using this technique to encourage contributions. It's a known method to increase the likelihood of compliance with a subsequent request.

G, cognitive dissonance, is another possibility. If someone accepts the address labels for free, they might feel a sense of obligation to contribute, to avoid feeling inconsistent. But I'm not sure if that's the primary principle here. The question is about the principle the group is trying to use, which is more likely a compliance strategy rather than dissonance.

So I think the correct answer is A: compliance strategy.

The nonprofit environmental group is using a compliance strategy by offering free address labels to increase the likelihood of contributions. This aligns with the foot-in-the-door technique, a known compliance strategy where a small request is used to make a larger request more acceptable later.

Answer: A
