Okay, so I've got this question about why voting rates are lower among Americans aged 18 to 25. The question is asking which option does NOT contribute to that. Let me think through each option one by one.

First, the question is about exceptions, so I need to find the option that doesn't contribute to lower voting rates. So, all the other options probably do contribute, but one doesn't.

Option A: Belief that their vote won't make a difference. That makes sense. If young people think their vote doesn't count, they're less likely to vote. I've heard that before as a reason for low turnout.

Option B: Political issues being remote from daily lives. Young people might feel that politics doesn't affect them directly, so they don't see the point in voting. That sounds plausible.

Option C: Frequent relocation. If someone moves a lot, especially to a new state or area, they might not register to vote or update their registration, making it harder to vote. That could lower rates.

Option D: Minimum voting age is 21 in some states. Wait, the national voting age is 18, but some states have it higher? I'm not sure. If some states require voters to be 21, that could affect 18-25 year olds in those states, making it harder for them to vote when they turn 18 or 19. But I'm not certain if this is a widespread issue or just a few states. Still, it seems like it could contribute.

Option E: Voting isn't mandatory. In the US, voting is voluntary. If it were mandatory, more people would have to vote, but since it's not, some just don't bother. That definitely contributes to lower rates.

Option F: Difficulty understanding the process. If young voters don't understand how to register or where to vote, they might not participate. That makes sense.

Option G: Lack of interest in politics. If they're not interested, they won't vote. Straightforward.

Option H: College attendance in a different state. When students go to college out of state, they might not register to vote there or understand how to vote locally. Plus, they might feel disconnected from home issues. So this could lower their voting rates.

Option I: Perception that all candidates are the same. If young voters think there's no difference between candidates, they might not see the point in voting. That could reduce turnout.

Option J: Inability to get to polling locations. If they can't reach the polls due to distance or lack of transportation, they can't vote. That's a clear barrier.

Now, looking for the exception. The question is which one does NOT contribute. So which of these factors actually doesn't lower voting rates?

Wait, let's think about Option D again. The minimum voting age being 21 in some states. If the voting age is higher, that would exclude 18-20 year olds in those states. But the question is about the 18-25 age bracket. So in states where the age is 21, 18-20 year olds can't vote, but 21-25 can. So those states would have lower participation from the 18-25 group because a portion (18-20) can't vote. So that does contribute to lower rates. Therefore, D is a contributing factor, so it's not the exception.

Wait, but the question is about all options contributing except one. So which one doesn't contribute?

Alternatively, perhaps Option H: College attendance in another state. If someone is attending college out of state, they might not vote because they're away, but they could still vote by absentee ballot. Maybe some don't bother, but is this a significant factor? Or does it actually not contribute as much as others?

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think of each option's impact.

Option D: If a state has a higher voting age, then in that state, 18-20 year olds can't vote. So for the 18-25 bracket, in such states, their voting rate is lower because a part of the group can't vote. So D does contribute.

So the exception must be one of the others. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps Option H: College attendance in another state. Maybe students who move for college actually have higher voting rates because they're more politically active. Or maybe it's not as much a barrier as I thought. Alternatively, maybe it's not a significant factor compared to other options.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is D because not all states have 21 as the voting age. Most have 18, so maybe the impact is minimal. Or perhaps the question is implying that D doesn't affect the 18-25 group because those states where it's 21 would only exclude 18-20, but the 21-25 can still vote. So maybe D is not a contributing factor because it's not a widespread issue.

Wait, but the question is asking which does NOT contribute. So the correct answer is the one that doesn't cause lower voting rates.

Wait, another angle: If some states have 21 as the voting age, then 18-20 year olds can't vote in those states. So in those states, the 18-25 group has lower participation because a part can't vote. So D does contribute.

So going back, which is the exception.

Wait, perhaps the answer is H: College attendance in another state. Because college students might actually be more politically active. Or perhaps it's not a significant barrier because they can vote absentee. So maybe H doesn't contribute as much as others.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is E: voting is not mandatory. But that seems like it definitely contributes.

Wait, perhaps the answer is D because it's not a federal law but a state law, and it's not as widespread. Maybe most states have 18 as the voting age, so D doesn't contribute much.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is H because college students can still vote, just from a different location. So maybe college attendance doesn't lower their voting rates because they can still participate, just from their college address.

Wait, but the question is about lower voting rates among 18-25 year olds. So if they move to another state for college, they might not re-register or might not know how to vote in their new state. So that could lower their voting rates.

Hmm, this is tricky. Maybe the exception is D because it's not a federal issue but a state one, and the question is about the general 18-25 age group. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is H because while they are in a different state, they can still vote absentee, so it's not a barrier. So H doesn't contribute as much.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to think of each option's impact.

A: Belief votes don't matter – yes, lowers rates.

B: Issues seem distant – yes.

C: Frequent moves – yes.

D: Some states have 21 as voting age – yes, affects 18-20, so lowers rates in those states.

E: Voting not mandatory – yes.

F: Difficulty understanding – yes.

G: Lack of interest – yes.

H: College in another state – may lower rates because they have to deal with absentee voting or might not bother, but maybe it's not as significant as others.

I: Candidates seem same – yes.

J: Can't get to polls – yes.

So which one doesn't contribute? Maybe H? Or perhaps E is a given, but E is about mandatory voting, which definitely affects.

Wait, the question says "all of the following contribute except." So the exception is the one that doesn't contribute. So perhaps H doesn't contribute as much as others. Or maybe it's D because it's not a federal law, but the question is about 18-25, so in states where it's 21, that group is affected.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is D because it's not a federal law, but the question is about the 18-25 age bracket, so D affects a subset of that group, but the question is about the factors that contribute in general.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should look for which option is not a reason. For example, if an option actually encourages voting, that would be the exception. But all options seem negative.

Wait, perhaps H: College attendance in another state. Maybe college students are more likely to vote because they're more politically active, or because they're in an environment that encourages voting. Or perhaps it's not a barrier. Wait, that's possible. If you're on a college campus, there might be more efforts to get you to vote, so maybe H doesn't contribute to lower rates but actually the opposite. So H might be the exception.

Wait, but the question is about lower voting rates, so the exception is the one that doesn't contribute. So if H actually doesn't lower rates, it's the exception.

Alternatively, perhaps H does lower rates because they have to deal with absentee voting, which can be a hassle. So they might not vote.

Hmm. I'm not sure. I think I'll have to make a decision based on the options.

Wait, the correct answer is likely D: the fact that the minimum voting age in some states is 21. Because that does affect the 18-20 age group, which is part of the 18-25 bracket. So D contributes, so it's not the exception.

Wait, but the question is about the exception. So the correct answer must be the one that doesn't contribute. So perhaps the exception is H: college attendance in another state. Because even though they are in a different state, they can still vote by absentee ballot, so it's not a barrier. Or maybe it's not a significant factor.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is E: voting is not mandatory. But that definitely contributes because if it were mandatory, more would vote.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. I think I'll have to go with D as the exception because it's a state-level issue and maybe doesn't affect the overall 18-25 bracket as much. But I'm not confident.

Wait, another approach: Which option is a reason for lower rates, and which is not. Let me think of each.

A: Yes, apathy.

B: Yes, issues seem distant.

C: Yes, moving makes registration harder.

D: Yes, if you're under 21 in some states, you can't vote.

E: Yes, non-mandatory.

F: Yes, complexity.

G: Yes, lack of interest.

H: Yes, relocation makes it harder to vote.

I: Yes, candidate perception.

J: Yes, access issues.

So all options except one contribute. So which one is the exception. Hmm. Maybe H: college attendance in another state. Because while they are in another state, they can still vote absentee. So maybe it's not as much a barrier as other options. Or perhaps it's not a significant factor.

Wait, no, college students often face issues with absentee voting, like not knowing how to do it or having the necessary ID. So H does contribute.

Wait, then perhaps the exception is D: because in most states, the voting age is 18, so D doesn't apply widely. So it's not a major contributing factor.

But the question is about the 18-25 age group. So in states where the age is 21, the 18-20 can't vote, which affects the overall group. So D does contribute.

Wait, I'm really stuck. Maybe the answer is H. Alternatively, maybe it's E, but E definitely contributes.

Wait, perhaps the answer is H. Because college students might have higher voting rates because of the environment, so it doesn't contribute to lower rates. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is D. Because while some states have 21, it's not a federal law, so it's not a widespread issue. But the question is about factors that contribute, so D is a factor.

I think I'll have to make a choice. I think the correct answer is D: the fact that the minimum voting age in some states is 21. Because it does affect the 18-20 age group in those states, thus contributing to lower rates. So the exception would be something else.

Wait, no, the question is asking which does NOT contribute. So I'm looking for the option that doesn't lower the rates.

Wait, perhaps the answer is H: college attendance in another state. Because even though they're in another state, they can still vote, so it doesn't lower rates. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is E: voting is not mandatory. That definitely contributes because if it were mandatory, more would vote. So E is a contributing factor.

Wait, I'm going in circles. Maybe I should check the options again.

The options are A to J.

The exception is the one that does not contribute.

Wait, perhaps the answer is H: college attendance in another state. Because while they are in another state, they can still vote, possibly by absentee ballot. So it's not a barrier. Therefore, it doesn't contribute to lower rates.

But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps H does contribute because they have to deal with registering in a new state, which can be a hassle.

I think I'll go with D as the exception because it's a state-level issue and not widely applicable, but I'm not certain.

The question asks which factor does NOT contribute to lower voting rates among Americans aged 18-25. Each option was analyzed for its potential impact on voting rates:

- **A, B, C, E, F, G, I, J**: These options clearly contribute to lower voting rates. For example, belief that votes don't matter (A), remoteness of political issues (B), and lack of interest in politics (G) all reduce turnout.

- **D**: The minimum voting age being 21 in some states affects 18-20 year olds, lowering their participation in those states. Thus, it contributes to lower rates.

- **H**: College attendance in another state might seem like a barrier, but students can vote absentee. While relocation can be a hassle, it doesn't inherently lower rates as much as other factors. Therefore, it is the exception.

**Answer: H**
