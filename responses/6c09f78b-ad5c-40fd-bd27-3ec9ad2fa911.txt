Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it says. Umi created a number pattern by adding the same amount each time to get the next number. The sequence given is 20, 40, 60, 80, and so on. The question is asking what the eighth number in this pattern will be. The options are A through J, with various numbers listed.

Alright, let's break this down. First, I know that when a pattern adds the same amount each time, it's called an arithmetic sequence. In arithmetic sequences, each term after the first is obtained by adding a constant difference to the previous term.

Looking at the numbers provided: 20, 40, 60, 80... I can see that each number is increasing by 20. Let me check that. 40 minus 20 is 20, 60 minus 40 is 20, and 80 minus 60 is also 20. So, yes, the common difference here is 20.

Now, the problem is asking for the eighth number in this sequence. The first four numbers are given, so I need to find the fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth terms.

Let me list the terms with their positions to make it clearer:

1st term: 20
2nd term: 40
3rd term: 60
4th term: 80
5th term: ?
6th term: ?
7th term: ?
8th term: ?

Since each term increases by 20, I can calculate each subsequent term by adding 20 to the previous one.

Let's compute them one by one.

5th term: 80 + 20 = 100
6th term: 100 + 20 = 120
7th term: 120 + 20 = 140
8th term: 140 + 20 = 160

Wait, but looking at the options, I see that option C is 160. So that should be the eighth term.

Alternatively, I can use the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence to find the eighth term directly. The formula is:

a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d

Where:
- a_n is the nth term,
- a_1 is the first term,
- d is the common difference,
- n is the term number.

Plugging in the values we have:
a_1 = 20
d = 20
n = 8

So,

a_8 = 20 + (8 - 1)*20
     = 20 + 7*20
     = 20 + 140
     = 160

That confirms it. The eighth term is 160, which is option C.

I don't think I made any mistakes here. The pattern is straightforward, adding 20 each time, and the formula gives the same result as calculating each term step by step. So, I'm confident that the correct answer is C: 160.

The pattern increases by 20 each time. The eighth term is calculated as 20 + (8-1)*20 = 160.

Answer: C
