Okay, so I have to figure out what Aquinas believed about man's ultimate happiness. I remember Aquinas is a medieval philosopher and theologian, and his ideas are heavily influenced by Aristotle and Christianity. Let me think about his works, especially the Summa Theologica.

From what I recall, Aquinas discusses the concept of happiness or beatitude. He differentiates between different types of happiness—like temporal and eternal. Temporal happiness is related to things in this life, while eternal happiness is about union with God, which is the ultimate goal.

In his discussion, he probably argues that while things like friendship, wealth, and health contribute to happiness, they aren't the ultimate end. The ultimate happiness is something much higher. I think he refers to this as the "beatific vision," where the soul sees God as He is, leading to complete fulfillment.

Looking at the options, let's go through each one. Option C is "loving God." That sounds plausible because Aquinas does talk about love as a key part of the relationship with God. But is it the ultimate happiness? Or is it more about the union or contemplation?

Option F is "contemplating God." That rings a bell more because in some of his writings, he emphasizes that the highest form of contemplation is the contemplation of God. Contemplation is an intellectual activity, and for Aquinas, the intellect plays a significant role in understanding and desiring God.

Option I is "acquiring knowledge and wisdom." While knowledge is important, especially through philosophy and theology, Aquinas sees it as a means to an end rather than the end itself. The end is knowing God, not just knowledge for its own sake.

Option J is "living a life free of suffering." That's more of a secular view, and I don't think Aquinas would see that as the ultimate happiness. He probably views suffering as a part of the human condition and something to be transcended through divine union.

Option E is "achieving personal success." That's more modern and self-centered. Aquinas's view is more about the common good and the divine, so this doesn't seem right.

Option B is "acts of the moral virtues." While moral virtues are important for leading a good life and achieving happiness, they are part of the journey but not the ultimate end. The end is higher than just moral actions.

Option G is "acts of charity towards others." Charity is important, especially as part of Christian doctrine, but again, it's a means to help others and contribute to one's own happiness, but not the ultimate end itself.

Option D is "pleasure." Aquinas would see pleasure as a lower good, something that can be a part of life but not the ultimate goal. Excessive pleasure can even be harmful.

Option A is "worldly possessions and wealth." Possessions can contribute to comfort, but Aquinas would likely see material wealth as a lower good and potentially a distraction from the higher pursuit of God.

Option H is "power and control." That seems more aligned with a secular or political view, not something Aquinas would prioritize.

So, narrowing it down, the key seems to be between C and F. Loving God (C) and contemplating God (F). Aquinas does talk about love, especially in the context of charity, but his ultimate end is more about the intellectual contemplation of God. In some texts, he describes the beatific vision as the ultimate happiness, which is a form of contemplation.

I think the answer is F: contemplating God.

The answer is F: contemplating God.
