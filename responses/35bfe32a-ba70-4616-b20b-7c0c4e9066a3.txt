Okay, so I need to figure out what the Moche built at the heart of their urban center. I remember that the Moche were an ancient Andean culture, and they were known for their impressive architecture and urban planning. Let me think about what I know about them.

First, looking at the options, I can try to eliminate some that don't fit. Option A is the Temple of the Feathered Serpent, which I think is actually more associated with the Aztecs, not the Moche. Option E, the Pyramid of the Sun, is a well-known structure, but I believe that's more related to the Teotihuacan civilization in Mexico, not the Moche in Peru.

Option D mentions a complex irrigation system. The Moche did rely heavily on agriculture, especially in the arid coastal regions, so they probably had some irrigation systems. But the question is about the heart of their urban center, so maybe it's not the irrigation itself but something more central within the city.

Option F, the Tower of Moche, doesn't ring a bell as a specific structure I've heard about. Option G, an extensive library, seems unlikely because I don't recall the Moche having a written record system as advanced as, say, the Inca. They might have had some form of writing, but a library doesn't sound central to their urban centers.

Option H, a central marketplace, is possible because many ancient cities had marketplaces. However, I'm not sure if the Moche's central area was specifically a marketplace or something else more monumental.

Option I says a vast complex of temples and artisan workshops. That sounds plausible because the Moche were known for their religious practices and had elaborate temples. They also had skilled artisans, so having workshops in the urban center makes sense as part of their economy and culture.

Option J is an amphitheater for gladiatorial combats. I'm not certain about the Moche having such structures, but I think that's more associated with the Roman Empire or other cultures where gladiatorial games were common. The Moche might have had some form of public entertainment, but I'm not sure if it was as structured as an amphitheater.

So, considering all these, the Moche built urban centers with significant structures. I remember reading that they had large pyramids, like the Huaca del Sol and the Huaca de la Luna, which were temple complexes. These were massive structures in the middle of their cities, serving as religious centers and focal points.

Looking back at the options, option I mentions a vast complex of temples and artisan workshops. That aligns with the idea of having both religious structures and areas for crafting, which would be centrally located. The Moche were known for their pottery and other artisanal goods, so having workshops there makes sense.

So, putting it all together, the answer is likely option I.

The Moche built a vast complex of temples and artisan workshops at the heart of their urban centers, reflecting their religious practices and economic activities.
