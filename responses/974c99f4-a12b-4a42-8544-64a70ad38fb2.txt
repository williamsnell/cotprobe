Question:

How many moles are there in one atom?

Options:

A: 2 moles
B: 0 moles
C: 3.01 × 10^-23 moles
D: 12.04 × 10^23 moles
E: 1.66 × 10^-24 moles
F: 5 × 10^-23 moles
G: 1 mole
H: 8.31 × 10^-24 moles
I: 6.02 × 10^23 moles
J: 0.5 moles

Okay, so I have this question about how many moles are there in one atom. Hmm, I remember that the mole is a unit used in chemistry to represent a specific amount of a substance. Wait, the mole is defined based on Avogadro's number, right? Avogadro's number is 6.022 x 10^23 particles per mole. Particles could be atoms, molecules, ions, etc.

So, the question is asking how many moles are in one atom. Since Avogadro's number tells us how many atoms make up a mole, that means one mole contains 6.022 x 10^23 atoms. Therefore, if I have just one atom, how many moles is that? It should be the reciprocal of Avogadro's number.

Let me think. If 1 mole = 6.022e23 atoms, then 1 atom = 1 / (6.022e23) moles. Calculating that would give approximately 1.66e-24 moles. Wait, looking at the options, option E is 1.66 × 10^-24 moles. That makes sense because 1 divided by 6.022e23 is roughly 1.66e-24.

Let me double-check the other options to make sure I'm not missing something. Option B is 0 moles, which can't be right because an atom has some amount, even if it's tiny. Option G says 1 mole, but that's way too big since a mole has a huge number of atoms. Option I is Avogadro's number, which is the number of atoms in a mole, so that's not the moles per atom. The other options don't seem to fit either. So I think the correct answer is E.

The number of moles in one atom is the reciprocal of Avogadro's number, which is approximately 1.66 × 10^-24 moles.

Answer: E
