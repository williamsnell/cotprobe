Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about the balance the Supreme Court has struck between the establishment clause and the free-exercise clause. I'm a bit rusty on my constitutional law, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that the First Amendment has two clauses related to religion: the establishment clause and the free-exercise clause. The establishment clause says the government can't establish an official religion, while the free-exercise clause protects the right to practice religion freely.

The question is asking which option best describes the balance between these two. So I need to recall some Supreme Court cases and their rulings.

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: The government can restrict the free exercise of religion in the interest of national security. Hmm, that sounds like it's talking about a specific situation, maybe related to the free exercise clause. But I'm not sure if this is about the balance between the two clauses. It seems more like a limitation on free exercise for other reasons, not the establishment clause's role.

Option B: Freedom of speech is protected except in certain situations, like yelling "fire" in a crowded theater. Wait, that's about free speech, not religion. The question is about the balance between establishment and free-exercise clauses. So B is probably not the right answer.

Option C: All religious practices are prohibited in public schools. That sounds too broad. I remember the Court has ruled on school prayer and religious activities. For example, the Court has said that state-sponsored prayer in schools is unconstitutional, but students can pray on their own or in groups, as long as it's voluntary and not disruptive. So C might be incorrect because it's an absolute prohibition, which isn't the case.

Option D: The government can endorse a specific religion as long as it does not compel people to practice that religion. Wait, the establishment clause is about not endorsing a religion. So if the government endorses a specific religion, that might violate the establishment clause. I don't think the Court allows the government to endorse a religion, even if it doesn't compel practice. So D might be incorrect.

Option E: Once a church has been recognized by the federal government, its tax-exempt status can never be revoked. I'm not sure about this. I think the government can revoke tax-exempt status if the church doesn't meet certain criteria, like public policy reasons or violating laws. So E doesn't sound right either.

Option F: The government can fund religious activities as long as all religions are given equal opportunities. This reminds me of the Lemon Test, which the Supreme Court uses to evaluate laws affecting religion. The test includes whether the law has a secular purpose, doesn't have the primary effect of advancing or inhibiting religion, and doesn't result in excessive government entanglement with religion. Funding religious activities equally might pass, but I'm not sure if this is the best description of the balance.

Option G: The government is allowed to promote a specific religion as long as it does not interfere with the free exercise of other religions. Again, promoting a specific religion sounds like it violates the establishment clause. The government is supposed to be neutral, not promote any religion. So G might be incorrect.

Option H: Once Congress creates an administrative agency, that agency can only be dissolved by a constitutional amendment. That doesn't relate to religion clauses at all. It's about the structure of government, so H is off-topic.

Option I: State-sponsored prayer during school hours is prohibited, but voluntary prayer by student groups before school is allowed. This seems to align with what I remember. The Supreme Court has ruled that school-sponsored prayer is unconstitutional because it endorses a religion, violating the establishment clause. However, students can pray on their own or as part of a student-led group, as long as it's voluntary and doesn't disrupt the school. So I looks correct.

Option J: The government can neither endorse nor restrict any religious activities. That seems too broad. The government can restrict some religious activities if they conflict with laws, like safety regulations or property rights. Also, the government can't endorse, but J says neither endorse nor restrict any, which isn't accurate because sometimes restrictions are permissible.

So, putting it all together, the best answer seems to be I. State-sponsored prayer during school hours is prohibited, but voluntary prayer by student groups before school is allowed. This reflects the balance where the government doesn't endorse religion through state actions but allows personal religious expressions.

The correct answer is I. State-sponsored prayer during school hours is prohibited, but voluntary prayer by student groups before school is allowed. This reflects the balance struck by the Supreme Court, where the government avoids endorsing religion through state actions while allowing personal religious expressions.
