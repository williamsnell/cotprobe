Okay, so I've got this question about figuring out how many lamps I need to light up a room properly. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm not super familiar with lighting calculations, but I'll give it a shot.

First, the question says the room is rectangular, 4 meters by 3 meters. I think I need to find the area of the room because that's usually the first step in these kinds of problems. So, area is length times width. That would be 4m multiplied by 3m. Let me do that: 4 * 3 = 12 square meters. Got that down.

Next, the problem mentions an average illuminance of 50 lux. I remember that illuminance is measured in lux, and it's basically the amount of light per unit area. So, if the room needs to have an average of 50 lux, that means each square meter should get 50 units of light. 

Now, I think I need to find the total amount of light required for the entire room. That would be the illuminance multiplied by the area. So, 50 lux times 12 square meters. Let me calculate that: 50 * 12 = 600. So, the total light needed is 600 lux·m², which I think is the same as 600 lumens because each lamp provides 300 lumens. Wait, is that right? I'm a bit confused about the units here. But I think the formula is that the total luminous flux (which is in lumens) equals the illuminance multiplied by the area. So, yes, 50 * 12 = 600 lumens total needed.

Each lamp contributes 300 lumens. So, to find out how many lamps are needed, I divide the total required lumens by the lumens per lamp. That would be 600 / 300. Let me do that: 600 divided by 300 is 2. So, I need 2 lamps. 

Wait, but I'm wondering if there's something else I'm missing, like the efficiency or the way the light spreads. But the question seems straightforward, just asking for the number based on average illuminance and each lamp's output. So, I think 2 lamps should be enough. 

Looking at the options, option C is 2. So, I think that's the answer.

The room's area is 12 m². To achieve 50 lux, the total required luminous flux is 600 lumens. Each lamp provides 300 lumens, so 600 / 300 = 2 lamps are needed. 

Answer: C
