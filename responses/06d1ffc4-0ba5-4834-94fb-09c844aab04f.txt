Okay, so I have this question about classical conditioning. Hmm, I remember that classical conditioning is about learning through association, right? Like how Ivan Pavlov did that experiment with the dogs. So, the question is about how to eliminate a classically conditioned response.

The options are from A to J. Let me think about each one.

The question asks what can best eliminate a conditioned response. I think in classical conditioning, once a response is conditioned, it's based on the association between the conditioned stimulus (CS) and the unconditioned stimulus (US). So, how do you get rid of that response?

I remember something about extinction. Extinction is when the conditioned stimulus is presented without the unconditioned stimulus. So, if you show the dog the bell (CS) without giving them food (US), eventually they'll stop salivating to the bell. That makes sense because the association is broken when the expected outcome doesn't happen.

Looking at the options:

A: Unconditioned stimulus a few seconds before the conditioned stimulus. That might be a setup for something else, maybe a different kind of conditioning, but not extinction.

B: Neutral stimulus. A neutral stimulus doesn't elicit any response on its own, so I'm not sure how that would eliminate the conditioned response.

C: Both CS and US together. That sounds like the initial conditioning process, where they're paired, so this would reinforce the response, not eliminate it.

D: Neutral stimulus after the US. I'm not sure. Maybe this is about a different procedure, but extinction involves the absence of US after CS.

E: Unconditioned stimulus without a neutral stimulus. If you just give the US without the CS, does that matter? I don't think that directly affects the conditioned response.

F: Conditioned stimulus after the US. That might be a different timing. Normally, the CS comes before the US. If you reverse it, maybe it disrupts the association, but I'm not sure if that's the best way to eliminate the response.

G: Conditioned stimulus without US. Oh, that's exactly what I was thinking with extinction. Presenting CS without US leads to the conditioned response stopping over time.

H: Conditioned stimulus with a neutral stimulus. I don't think that would eliminate the response. Maybe it's a different kind of association, but not extinction.

I: Unconditioned stimulus without the conditioned stimulus. So you're giving the US but not the CS. But the conditioned response is about the CS. I'm not sure how that would eliminate the response because the US might still be present elsewhere.

J: Conditioned stimulus a few seconds before the US. That's the normal setup for conditioning, where CS precedes US. So that would actually strengthen the conditioned response, not eliminate it.

Wait, so the correct method is to present the CS without the US. That's option G. Because when the CS is given without the US, the dog (or subject) learns that the CS no longer predicts the US, so the response extinguishes.

So the answer should be G.

The best way to eliminate a classically conditioned response is through extinction, which occurs when the conditioned stimulus (CS) is repeatedly presented without the unconditioned stimulus (US). This process breaks the learned association between the CS and the US, leading to the disappearance of the conditioned response. Among the given options, option G describes presenting the conditioned stimulus without the unconditioned stimulus, which aligns with the extinction process.

Answer: G
