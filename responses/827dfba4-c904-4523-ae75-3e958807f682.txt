Okay, so I need to figure out how long a single term in the US Senate is. Hmm, I remember that the US has two main legislative bodies: the Senate and the House of Representatives. I think the House members are called Representatives or Congressmen/women, and the Senate members are called Senators. 

I recall that the terms for these two are different. The House has more frequent elections, I think every two years, but wait, does that mean their term length is two years? Or is it the Senate? No, wait, I think the House has a two-year term, so they can be up for election more often. That makes sense because the House is supposed to represent the people more directly, hence shorter terms.

So if the House is two years, what about the Senate? I think the Senate terms are longer. Maybe six years? Because I remember something about staggered terms. Oh right, every two years, one-third of the Senate is up for election. So if each term is six years, then every two years, a third of the senators would be replaced. That way, the Senate remains stable but still has some turnover.

Wait, let me think again. If it's six years, then after three elections, a senator would finish their term. That makes sense because it's a longer term than the House, allowing senators to focus on longer-term issues without being as swayed by short-term public opinion.

Looking at the options, E is six years, which matches what I'm thinking. The other options don't fit. Five years is too short for the Senate, and four years would be like the President's term, but that's not relevant here. Ten years seems too long, and one year is way too short. So yeah, I'm pretty confident the answer is E: six years.

The correct answer is E: six years. Senators in the US Senate serve six-year terms, with elections occurring every two years for one-third of the Senate seats to ensure stability and gradual turnover.

Answer: E
