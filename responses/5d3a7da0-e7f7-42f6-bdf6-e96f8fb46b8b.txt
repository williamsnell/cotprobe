Okay, so I've got this problem here about expressing a signal in terms of complex exponentials and then finding specific values. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The given signal is x₁(t) = cos(3πt) − 4 cos(5πt − 0.5π). The question is asking to express this as the real part of two complex exponentials, specifically in the form Real(A e^{jπBt}) + Real(D e^{jπEt}). Then, we need to find the values of B and E.

First, I remember that any cosine function can be written using Euler's formula. Euler's formula states that e^{jθ} = cosθ + j sinθ. So, the real part of e^{jθ} is just cosθ. But wait, the given expression has coefficients and phase shifts, so I need to account for those.

Looking at the first term: cos(3πt). I can write this as the real part of e^{j3πt} because cos(3πt) = Real(e^{j3πt}).

The second term is -4 cos(5πt − 0.5π). Hmm, this one is a bit trickier because there's a phase shift and a coefficient. Let me handle each part.

I know that cos(θ - φ) can be expanded using trigonometric identities. Specifically, cos(θ - φ) = cosθ cosφ + sinθ sinφ. So, applying that here, cos(5πt − 0.5π) = cos(5πt)cos(0.5π) + sin(5πt)sin(0.5π).

What's cos(0.5π)? That's cos(90 degrees), which is 0. And sin(0.5π) is sin(90 degrees) which is 1. So this simplifies to 0 + sin(5πt)*1 = sin(5πt). So the second term becomes -4 sin(5πt).

Now, I have x₁(t) = cos(3πt) −4 sin(5πt). But wait, the problem wants the expression in terms of the real parts of complex exponentials. So how do I express a sine term as a real part?

I remember that sinθ is the imaginary part of e^{jθ}, but I can also write sine in terms of complex exponentials. Let me think: e^{jθ} = cosθ + j sinθ. So, sinθ is (e^{jθ} - e^{-jθ})/(2j). But since we're taking the real part, maybe there's another approach.

Alternatively, I can think of -4 sin(5πt) as the real part of a complex exponential with some phase shift. Because sine is related to cosine with a phase shift. Remember that sinθ = cos(θ - π/2). So, sin(5πt) = cos(5πt - π/2). So, substituting back, the second term becomes -4 cos(5πt - π/2).

Wait, but in the problem statement, the expression is Real(A e^{jπBt}) + Real(D e^{jπEt}). So each real part is of the form Real(some complex exponential). Let me try to express each term as such.

The first term is cos(3πt) = Real(e^{j3πt}).

The second term is -4 cos(5πt − π/2). Let's see: cos(5πt − π/2) can be written as Real(e^{j(5πt − π/2)}), because the real part of e^{jθ} is cosθ. So, the second term is -4 * Real(e^{j(5πt − π/2)}).

But in the desired form, each term is just Real(something). So, perhaps we can factor out the -4 inside the Real operation. Because Real(a * e^{jθ}) = a * Real(e^{jθ}) if a is real. So, -4 * Real(e^{j(5πt − π/2)}) = Real(-4 e^{j(5πt − π/2)}).

Wait, is that correct? Because Real(a Z) = a Real(Z) if a is real. So yes, that works.

So putting it all together, x₁(t) = Real(e^{j3πt}) + Real(-4 e^{j(5πt − π/2)}).

But looking back at the problem statement, the expression is given as Real(A e^{jπBt}) + Real(D e^{jπEt}). Comparing, the first term corresponds to A=1 and B=3, because e^{j3πt} is e^{jπ*3t}.

The second term is Real(-4 e^{j(5πt − π/2)}). Let me factor the exponentials. Let me see:

e^{j(5πt − π/2)} = e^{j5πt} * e^{-jπ/2}.

But e^{-jπ/2} is equal to -j, since e^{-jπ/2} = cos(-π/2) + j sin(-π/2) = 0 - j*1 = -j.

So, the second term becomes Real(-4 * e^{j5πt} * (-j)).

Multiply the constants: -4 * (-j) = 4j. So, Real(4j e^{j5πt}).

Wait, but 4j is a purely imaginary number. Now, the Real part of j e^{j5πt} is the Real part of [j (cos5πt + j sin5πt)] = j cos5πt - sin5πt. The real part is -sin5πt. So, Real(4j e^{j5πt}) = 4*(-sin5πt) = -4 sin5πt. Which matches the earlier expression.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the desired form is Real(A e^{jπBt}) + Real(D e^{jπEt}). So, each term is a real part of a complex exponential. My second term is Real(4j e^{j5πt}) but that's not quite in the form Real(D e^{jπEt}) because of the 4j factor. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps I should represent the second term differently. Let me think again. The second term is -4 cos(5πt - π/2). Let me write that as Real(-4 e^{j(5πt - π/2)}), which would be correct because Real(e^{jθ})=cosθ.

So, Real(-4 e^{j(5πt - π/2)}).

But then, in the problem, it's expressed as Real(D e^{jπE t}).

So, I can write the second term as Real(D e^{jπE t}), where D is -4 and the exponent is j(5πt - π/2). Wait, but in the exponent, it's j(5π t - π/2) = j5π t * j(-π/2). Wait, perhaps factor it as jπ*(5 t) * e^{-j (π/2)}.

Wait, perhaps I should write the exponent as jπ*(5 t) multiplied by some factor. Because the exponentials in the problem have jπ multiplied by B t and E t. So, the exponent in the second term is j(5πt - π/2) = j5π t - jπ/2. That doesn't directly fit the form jπ E t, unless I have some scaling.

Wait, perhaps I can factor out jπ from the exponent. Let me see: j(5πt - π/2) = jπ [5t - (1/2)]. So, the exponential becomes e^{jπ [5t - 1/2]} = e^{jπ *5 t} * e^{-jπ * 1/2}.

So, the second term is Real(-4 e^{jπ *5 t} e^{-jπ/2}) = Real( -4 e^{-jπ/2} e^{jπ *5 t} ).

But e^{-jπ/2} is equal to cos(-π/2) + j sin(-π/2) = 0 - j*1 = -j. So, the second term becomes Real( -4*(-j) e^{jπ *5 t} ) = Real(4j e^{jπ *5 t}).

Now, 4j is a complex number. So, Real(4j e^{jπ5t}) is the real part of 4j*(cos(5πt) + j sin(5πt)).

Expanding that: 4j cos(5πt) + 4j^2 sin(5πt) = 4j cos(5πt) -4 sin(5πt) (since j^2 = -1).

The real part of this is -4 sin(5πt), which is correct as per the original expression.

But looking back, the problem wants each term to be of the form Real(A e^{jπB t}) and Real(D e^{jπE t}).

In this case, the second term is Real(4j e^{jπ5 t}), which is equivalent to Real( (4j) e^{jπ5 t} ), so D would be 4j, but that's a complex number, not a real coefficient. But in the problem statement, I think A and D are meant to be real numbers because the options given for B and E are integers, and A and D are probably real.

Hmm, perhaps I should represent the second term as a single complex exponential without the phase shift. Let me think differently.

Wait, perhaps I can write the second term, -4 cos(5πt - π/2), as a real part of a complex exponential with a phase shift. So, cos(5πt - π/2) = cos(5πt) cos(π/2) + sin(5πt) sin(π/2) = 0 + sin(5πt) = sin(5πt). Therefore, -4 cos(5πt - π/2) = -4 sin(5πt).

But how to write -4 sin(5πt) as the real part of a complex exponential. Let me recall that sinθ = (e^{jθ} - e^{-jθ})/(2j). So, -4 sin(5πt) = -4*(e^{j5πt} - e^{-j5πt})/(2j) ) = (-4/(2j))(e^{j5πt} - e^{-j5πt}) = (-2/j)(e^{j5πt} - e^{-j5πt}).

But 1/j is -j, because j*(-j) = 1. So, -2/j = -2*(-j) = 2j.

So, -4 sin(5πt) = 2j (e^{j5πt} - e^{-j5πt}).

But I'm not sure if this is helping. Alternatively, perhaps I can write sin(5πt) = cos(5πt - π/2), but that's where I started.

Wait, perhaps I can express the second term as a real part of a complex exponential with a phase shift. Let me think: cos(θ - φ) = Real(e^{j(θ - φ)}). So, the second term is -4 cos(5πt - π/2) = Real(-4 e^{j(5πt - π/2)}).

So, Real(-4 e^{j(5πt - π/2)}) = Real( (-4 e^{-jπ/2}) e^{j5πt} ) = Real( (-4)(-j) e^{j5πt} ) = Real(4j e^{j5πt} ).

Wait, but 4j is a complex number, so Real(4j e^{j5πt}) would involve taking the real part of a complex exponential multiplied by 4j. Let me compute that:

4j e^{j5πt} = 4j [cos(5πt) + j sin(5πt)] = 4j cos(5πt) + 4j^2 sin(5πt) = 4j cos(5πt) -4 sin(5πt).

The real part of this is -4 sin(5πt), which is correct. So, the second term is indeed Real(4j e^{j5πt}).

But in the problem statement, each term is of the form Real(A e^{jπBt}), where A is real. So, in this case, A would be 4j, which is not real. That's a problem because I think A and D are supposed to be real numbers.

Wait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Maybe I should consider that the original expression has a phase shift of -0.5π, which can be represented as a complex exponential with a different phase. Let me see:

The second term is -4 cos(5πt - π/2) = Real(-4 e^{j(5πt - π/2)}).

But 5πt - π/2 = π(5t - 1/2). So, in the form e^{jπE t}, if I have e^{jπE t}, perhaps I can write the exponent as jπ(5t - 1/2) = jπ5t - jπ/2. So, this would be e^{jπ5t} * e^{-jπ/2}.

So, the second term is Real(-4 e^{jπ5t} e^{-jπ/2} ) = Real( (-4 e^{-jπ/2}) e^{jπ5t} ).

But e^{-jπ/2} is -j, so this becomes Real( (-4)(-j) e^{jπ5t} ) = Real(4j e^{jπ5t}).

Again, same situation. So, is there a way to represent this as a real part of a complex exponential with a real coefficient?

Alternatively, perhaps I can factor out the phase shift. Let me think: since e^{-jπ/2} = -j, then -4 e^{-jπ/2} = -4*(-j) = 4j. So, the coefficient becomes 4j, which is a complex number. But the problem wants the expression as Real(A e^{jπ B t}) + Real(D e^{jπ E t}), where A and D are real. So, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I can express the second term as a sum of two real parts. Because 4j e^{j5πt} is the same as 4j (cos5πt + j sin5πt) = 4j cos5πt -4 sin5πt. So, the real part is -4 sin5πt. But that's not helpful because it's not a single real part of an exponential.

Alternatively, maybe I should accept that the second term can't be written as a single real part of a complex exponential with a real coefficient and instead think differently.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me go back to the original expression: x₁(t) = cos(3πt) −4 cos(5πt−0.5π).

I can write each cosine term as the real part of its corresponding complex exponential. So:

cos(3πt) = Real(e^{j3πt}).

cos(5πt−0.5π) = Real(e^{j(5πt−0.5π)}).

So, substituting into x₁(t):

x₁(t) = Real(e^{j3πt}) −4 Real(e^{j(5πt−0.5π)}).

But the problem wants this expressed as Real(A e^{jπBt}) + Real(D e^{jπE t}).

So, grouping the real parts, we can write this as:

x₁(t) = Real(e^{j3πt}) + Real(−4 e^{j(5πt−0.5π)}).

Which fits the form with A = 1, B=3, D=−4, and the exponent in the second term is jπ E t. Wait, the exponent in the second term is j(5πt −0.5π) = jπ(5t) − j(0.5π). But that's jπ*(5t) times something. Hmm, perhaps I can factor out jπ.

Wait, wait. Let me look at the exponents in the problem statement. Each exponential is e^{jπ B t} and e^{jπ E t}. So, the first term is e^{j3πt} which is e^{jπ *3 t}, so B=3. The second term's exponent is j(5πt −0.5π) = jπ*(5t) − jπ*(0.5). So, it's e^{jπ*(5t)} multiplied by e^{-jπ*(0.5)}. So, the exponent can be written as e^{jπ *5 t} * e^{-jπ/2}.

So, the second term is −4 e^{jπ*(5t)} * e^{-jπ/2}.

But e^{-jπ/2} is a constant phase shift, which is −j. So, the coefficient becomes −4 * (−j) = 4j. So, the second term becomes 4j e^{jπ5t}.

So now, x₁(t) = Real(e^{j3πt}) + Real(4j e^{j5πt}).

But wait, Real(4j e^{j5πt}) is problematic because 4j is imaginary. The problem's form requires the coefficients A and D to be real, right? Because if A is complex, it would complicate things.

Hmm, perhaps I'm approaching this incorrectly. Let me think differently. Maybe I can manipulate each term to have the form Real(A e^{jπBt}).

Let me consider the second term again: −4 cos(5πt−0.5π) = −4 sin(5πt) as I found earlier. So, x₁(t) = cos(3πt) −4 sin(5πt).

Now, I can write each sine and cosine term as the real part of a complex exponential. But wait, sinθ is the imaginary part of e^{jθ}. But I can also represent it as a real part with a phase shift.

Wait, I know that cos(θ + π/2) = -sinθ. So, sinθ = -cos(θ + π/2). So, −4 sin(5πt) = −4*(-cos(5πt + π/2)) =4 cos(5πt + π/2).

So, x₁(t) = cos(3πt) +4 cos(5πt + π/2).

Now, writing each cosine as the real part of an exponential:

cos(3πt) = Real(e^{j3πt}).

4 cos(5πt + π/2) =4 Real(e^{j(5πt + π/2)}).

So, x₁(t) = Real(e^{j3πt}) + Real(4 e^{j(5πt + π/2)}).

This fits the desired form: Real(A e^{jπBt}) + Real(D e^{jπE t} ), where A=1, B=3, D=4, and E=5.

Wait, but wait. In this case, the exponent for the second term is j(5πt + π/2) = jπ(5t + 0.5). So, that would be jπ*5t + jπ*0.5. But in the problem statement, the exponent is jπE t. So, I can write the exponent as jπ*5t multiplied by e^{jπ*0.5}.

Wait, but the problem's form is e^{jπBt}, so the exponent is jπ multiplied by B times t. So, for the second term, the exponent is jπ*5t + jπ*0.5. That would mean E*t + some constant, which doesn't fit the form jπE t. So, perhaps this approach isn't correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I can factor the exponent as jπ*(5t + 0.5) = jπ*5(t + 0.1). But that doesn't help because the problem's form is jπE t, implying that the exponent is proportional to t, not t plus a constant.

Wait, but looking back, the problem's form is Real(A e^{jπ B t}) + Real(D e^{jπ E t}). So, the exponents are jπ B t and jπ E t, which are functions of t only. But in the second term, after the phase shift, I have jπ*(5t + 0.5), which would be jπ*5 t + jπ*0.5. This would mean that the exponent isn't purely proportional to t, which complicates things.

Hmm, perhaps the initial approach was better. Let me go back to the original expression and see if I can find B and E directly.

In the given expression, x₁(t) = cos(3πt) −4 cos(5πt−0.5π). When expressed as the sum of two real parts of complex exponentials, each term corresponds to a cosine function.

The first term is cos(3πt), which corresponds to A=1 and B=3 because e^{j3πt} has an exponent of jπ*3t.

The second term is −4 cos(5πt −0.5π). Let's write this as Real(D e^{jπE t}), where D is a complex number. But since the problem likely expects D to be real, perhaps I can write the second term as a real part with a phase shift.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think: the problem wants B and E. The first term is cos(3πt) which comes from e^{j3πt}, so B=3. The second term is cos(5πt−0.5π), which comes from e^{j(5πt−0.5π)}. So, the exponent is jπ*5t multiplied by e^{-j0.5π}.

But the problem's form is e^{jπE t}, so E would be 5 because the coefficient of t is 5π. So, B is 3 and E is 5.

Wait, but looking at the options, option F is [3,5], which would match B=3 and E=5. So, the answer would be F.

Wait, but let me double-check. The first term is Real(e^{j3πt}), so B=3. The second term is Real(−4 e^{j(5πt −0.5π)}), which can be written as Real(−4 e^{-j0.5π} e^{j5πt}) = Real(−4*(-j) e^{j5πt}) = Real(4j e^{j5πt}).

But in the problem statement, each term is Real(A e^{jπBt}) + Real(D e^{jπE t}), so perhaps the exponents just need to match jπBt and jπE t. So, the second term's exponent is j5πt, which is jπ*(5)t. So, E=5.

Yes, that makes sense. So, B is 3 and E is 5, so the answer is option F: [3,5].
</think>

The given signal is \( x_1(t) = \cos(3\pi t) - 4\cos(5\pi t - 0.5\pi) \). To express this in the form \( x_1(t) = \text{Real}(A e^{j\pi B t}) + \text{Real}(D e^{j\pi E t}) \), we analyze each term.

1. **First Term**:  
   \( \cos(3\pi t) \) can be written as \( \text{Real}(e^{j3\pi t}) \).  
   Comparing with \( \text{Real}(A e^{j\pi B t}) \), we find \( A = 1 \) and \( B = 3 \).

2. **Second Term**:  
   \( -4\cos(5\pi t - 0.5\pi) \) can be expressed using Euler's formula as \( \text{Real}(-4 e^{j(5\pi t - 0.5\pi)}) \).  
   Simplifying the exponent, \( j(5\pi t - 0.5\pi) = j\pi(5t) - j\pi(0.5) \), which fits the form \( j\pi E t \) with \( E = 5 \).

Thus, \( B = 3 \) and \( E = 5 \), corresponding to option **F**.

**Answer:** F
