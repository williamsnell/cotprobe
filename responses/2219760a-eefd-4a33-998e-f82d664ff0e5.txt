Okay, so I'm trying to solve this optics problem about prisms. Hmm, I remember that prisms can cause light to disperse into different colors, right? The question is about mean deviation and dispersion for both crown and flint prisms. 

Let me read the problem again. We have a crown prism with an apex angle of 10°, and a flint prism also with 10°. The indices of refraction are given: 1.508 for crown and 1.620 for flint. Their dispersive powers are 0.018 and 0.031, respectively. The options are A to J, each giving different mean deviations and dispersions for both types of glass.

I think the formulas I need are for mean deviation and dispersion. For a prism, the mean deviation (δ) is given by δ = (n-1) * A, where n is the refractive index and A is the apex angle. Wait, no, I think that's for a right-angled prism. Wait, no, that formula might be for the deviation formula when a prism causes a beam to bend. Alternatively, I think the correct formula for the mean deviation of a prism is δ = (n - 1) * A. But wait, I'm not sure. Maybe I should double-check.

Wait, another thought: the mean deviation for a prism is given by δ = (n - 1) * A. But wait, actually, I think that's the formula for a right-angled prism, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe it's δ = (n - 1) * A * sin(theta), but I'm not sure. Wait, perhaps I'm confusing this with something else. Maybe I should think about the basic formula for the deviation caused by a prism.

Wait, another approach: the deviation produced by a prism when a ray enters and exits can be calculated using the formula δ = (n - 1) * A, where A is the apex angle in radians. Wait, but the apex angle here is given in degrees, so I might need to convert it to radians. Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses degrees directly, depending on how it's derived.

Wait, let me think again. Oh, right, the formula for the mean deviation of a prism is indeed δ = (n - 1) * A, where A is in radians. Because the formula comes from (n-1) multiplied by the angle in radians. So first, I need to convert the apex angle from degrees to radians. Wait, 10 degrees. So in radians, that's 10 * (π/180) ≈ 0.1745 radians.

So for the crown prism: n = 1.508. So δ_crown = (1.508 - 1) * 0.1745. Let's compute that. 0.508 * 0.1745 ≈ 0.508 * 0.1745. Let me calculate that. 0.5 * 0.1745 is about 0.08725, and 0.008 * 0.1745 is about 0.001396. Adding them gives approximately 0.0886 radians. To convert back to degrees, multiply by (180/π). So 0.0886 * (180/3.1416) ≈ 0.0886 * 57.2958 ≈ 5.08 degrees. So the mean deviation for the crown prism is about 5.08°.

Wait, that's the mean deviation. But the question also asks about dispersion. Dispersion for a prism is the difference in deviation between two wavelengths, usually measured as the difference between red and violet light. The dispersive power (v) is given as 0.018 for crown and 0.031 for flint. The formula for dispersion (D) is D = v * A. But wait, is that in degrees? Because v is typically in (1/mm or something), but I'm not sure. Wait, no, the dispersive power is usually defined as v = (n-1)/(λ), where λ is the wavelength in a vacuum, but perhaps in this context, it's used differently.

Wait, I think in the context of prisms, the dispersion is calculated as D = v * A, where A is in degrees, and v is the dispersive power. Because dispersive power is given as 0.018 for crown and 0.031 for flint. So for the crown prism, dispersion D = 0.018 * 10° = 0.18°, but wait, let me check the options. Alternatively, maybe I'm mixing this up.

Wait, wait, no, I think I might have it wrong. Dispersion is the difference in deviation between two wavelengths, and the formula is D = v * A. So for crown glass, D = 0.018 * 10° = 0.18°. For flint, D = 0.031 * 10° = 0.31°. So the dispersion for crown is 0.18°, and for flint, it's 0.31°.

Wait, looking at the options, let's see:

Option I: Flint glass: mean deviation 5.08°, dispersion 0.091°; Crown: 6.20°, 0.192°. No, that doesn't match.

Option F: Flint mean 6.50°, dispersion 0.031°; Crown mean 5.00°, dispersion 0.018°. Hmm, that seems to have swapped the deviations and dispersions, but our calculations don't match that.

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the mean deviation. Let me recheck. For the crown prism: n = 1.508, A =10°. Mean deviation δ = (n-1) * A in radians. Wait, but wait, the formula for mean deviation is δ = (n-1) * A, but A is in radians. So 10 degrees is 10 * π/180 ≈ 0.1745 radians. So (1.508 -1) * 0.1745 = 0.508 * 0.1745 ≈ 0.0886 radians. Converting to degrees: 0.0886 * (180/π) ≈ 5.08 degrees. So that's correct for the crown's mean deviation.

For the flint prism, n =1.620, so δ = (1.620 -1) * 0.1745 = 0.620 * 0.1745 ≈ 0.1082 radians. Converting to degrees: 0.1082 * (180/3.1416) ≈ 6.20 degrees.

So mean deviations: crown ≈5.08°, flint≈6.20°.

Dispersion: D = v * A (in degrees). So crown's dispersion is 0.018 * 10 = 0.18°, flint's is 0.031 *10 =0.31°.

Looking at the options:

Which option has flint mean deviation 6.20°, dispersion 0.31°, and crown 5.08°, 0.18°?

Looking through the options:

Option I: Flint mean 5.08, dispersion 0.091; crown 6.20, 0.192. No.

Option E: Flint 7.20, 0.200; crown 4.50, 0.080. No.

Option F: Flint 6.50, 0.031; crown 5.00, 0.018. No, because F's flint mean is 6.50, which is close to 6.20, but the dispersion is 0.031, which would be for flint's v=0.031, but that's not the dispersion, that's the dispersive power. So F is incorrect.

Option I: Flint mean 5.08, dispersion 0.091; crown 6.20, dispersion 0.192. Wait, but according to our calculations, crown's dispersion is 0.18, flint's 0.31. None of the options match exactly.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the dispersion calculation. Let me think again. Maybe the formula for dispersion is D = v * (n-1) * A? Or perhaps D = v * A?

Wait, another approach: I think the dispersive power v is defined as v = (n-1)/λ, where λ is the wavelength. But in the context of prisms, the dispersion is calculated as D = v * A, where A is in degrees. So for crown glass, D = 0.018 *10 = 0.18°, and for flint, D=0.031 *10=0.31°.

Looking at the options again:

Option I: Flint mean 5.08, dispersion 0.091; crown 6.20, dispersion 0.192. No.

Option I's numbers are reversed in terms of mean deviations. Wait, no. Wait, crown's mean is 5.08°, flint's is 6.20°, which matches our calculations. Their dispersions are 0.18 and 0.31, but looking at the options, none of them have 0.18 and 0.31. Wait, perhaps I misread the options.

Wait, looking again, option I says:

Flint glass: mean deviation 5.08°, dispersion 0.091°; Crown glass: mean deviation 6.20°, dispersion 0.192°.

Wait, that's the opposite of what we have. Because according to our calculations, flint has a higher mean deviation (6.20) and higher dispersion (0.31), while crown has 5.08 and 0.18.

But in option I, the mean deviations are swapped, and the dispersions are 0.091 and 0.192, which are lower than what we calculated. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the formula for mean deviation is different. Let me think again. Maybe I should use the formula δ = (n - 1) * A, where A is in degrees, not radians? Because if so, then for the crown prism: (1.508 -1) *10 = 0.508 *10 = 5.08°, which matches our previous calculation. For flint: (1.620-1)*10=0.620 *10=6.20°. So that's correct.

Dispersion: D = v * A. So crown: 0.018 *10=0.18°; flint:0.031 *10=0.31°. So now, looking for an option where flint has mean deviation 6.20°, dispersion 0.31°, and crown has 5.08°, 0.18°.

Looking at the options, none of them list these exact numbers. Let's check each option:

Option A: Flint mean 5.50, dispersion 0.030; crown 6.50, 0.210. No.

Option B: Flint 6.20, dispersion 0.192; crown 5.08, 0.091. Wait, flint's dispersion is 0.192, not 0.31. So that doesn't match.

Option C: Flint mean 0.091, dispersion 5.08; crown 0.192, 6.20. That's the reverse of what we have.

Option D: Flint 6.00, 0.020; crown 5.20, 0.100. No.

Option E: Flint 7.20, 0.200; crown 4.50, 0.080. No.

Option F: Flint 6.50, 0.031; crown 5.00, 0.018. No, doesn't match.

Option G: Flint 0.192, 6.20; crown 0.091,5.08. Again, reversed.

Option H: Flint 4.08, 0.095; crown 7.20, 0.185. No.

Option I: Flint 5.08, 0.091; crown 6.20, 0.192. Hmm, this has the mean deviations swapped between crown and flint, and the dispersions are 0.091 and 0.192, which are lower than our calculated values.

Option J: Flint 5.20, 0.18; crown 6.00, 0.090. No, not matching.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the dispersion calculation. Let me recheck. The dispersive power (v) is given as 0.018 for crown and 0.031 for flint. So D = v * A, where A is in degrees. So 0.018 *10=0.18°, and 0.031 *10=0.31°, which are correct.

Looking again, none of the options have these exact dispersions. So perhaps the question is asking about the other way around, like the flint's mean deviation and dispersion compared to the crown's.

Wait, looking back at the options, option I has flint's mean deviation as 5.08°, which is the same as our crown's mean deviation, and crown's mean deviation as 6.20°, which is our flint's mean. So perhaps the options have the mean deviation and dispersion swapped between the two glasses.

Wait, no, that can't be. The mean deviation depends on the refractive index, so crown (lower n) should have lower mean deviation than flint. Which is what our calculation shows: crown 5.08, flint 6.20.

Looking at option I, it says flint's mean is 5.08 and dispersion 0.091, while crown's mean is 6.20 and dispersion 0.192. That's the opposite. So that can't be correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the dispersion formula. Maybe dispersion is calculated as D = (n-1) * v * A? No, that doesn't make sense because v is (n-1)/λ, so combining with (n-1) would give (n-1)^2 / λ, which I don't think is the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for dispersion is D = (n-1) * (n'-1) * A, but that doesn't fit because n' is not provided here.

Wait, maybe the formula is D = (n - 1) * A * (n - 1) ? No, that would be (n-1)^2 * A, which doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the formulas. Let me think again. The mean deviation is (n-1)*A, and dispersion is v*A. So with the given values, crown has mean deviation 5.08°, dispersion 0.18°, and flint has mean deviation 6.20°, dispersion 0.31°.

Looking at the options, none of them have these numbers. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, maybe the problem is using a different formula for mean deviation. Let me think: Oh! Wait, perhaps the formula is δ = (n - 1) * A * sin(theta), but that's for a different scenario. Alternatively, perhaps I should use δ = (n - 1) * A, but A in degrees. Wait, I think I should check the correct formula.

Upon checking, the correct formula for the mean deviation of a prism is indeed δ = (n - 1) * A, where A is the apex angle in radians. But if A is given in degrees, then we can use the formula δ = (n - 1) * (A * π/180). So for A =10°, it's 10 * π/180 ≈ 0.1745 radians.

So, for crown: (1.508 -1) * 0.1745 ≈ 0.508 * 0.1745 ≈ 0.0886 radians. Convert to degrees: 0.0886 * (180/π) ≈ 5.08°, which is correct.

For flint: (1.620 -1) * 0.1745 ≈ 0.620 * 0.1745 ≈ 0.1082 radians. In degrees: 0.1082 * (180/3.1416) ≈ 6.20°, correct.

Dispersion: D = v * A (in degrees). So crown: 0.018 *10 =0.18°, flint:0.031 *10=0.31°.

Now, looking at the options again, none match exactly. So perhaps the options have an error or I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, looking at option I: Flint mean 5.08, dispersion 0.091; crown 6.20, 0.192. Wait, that's the opposite of what we have. So maybe the options have the crown and flint mixed up in the answer. Alternatively, perhaps I swapped the mean deviation and dispersion.

No, because the question asks for mean deviations and dispersions produced by each prism. So each prism would have its own mean deviation and dispersion.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the dispersion formula. Let me check another source. Oh, wait, dispersive power v is defined as v = (n - 1)/λ, but in practice, the dispersion D is given by D = v * A, where A is in degrees. So the calculation should be correct.

But looking at the options, none match. So perhaps I should look for the closest option.

Looking at option I again: It gives flint's mean deviation as 5.08 and dispersion 0.091, while crown's is 6.20 and 0.192. That's the reverse of our calculations, but maybe the options have the numbers switched.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the mean deviation and dispersion caused by each prism in terms of their effect. Wait, but the question says, "compute the mean deviations and dispersions produced by a crown prism... and a flint prism...", so each prism's own mean deviation and dispersion.

Given that, the correct numbers are:

Crown: mean deviation 5.08°, dispersion 0.18°.

Flint: mean deviation 6.20°, dispersion 0.31°.

Looking at the options, none of them have these exact numbers. The closest would be option I, which has crown's mean deviation as 6.20°, dispersion 0.192°, and flint's as 5.08°, dispersion 0.091°. But that's the opposite of what we calculated.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of dispersion. Let me double-check. For crown: 0.018 * 10 = 0.18°, correct. For flint: 0.031 *10=0.31°, correct.

Looking again, perhaps the options have swapped the mean deviation and dispersion values. So, for example, option I says flint has mean deviation 5.08 and dispersion 0.091, while crown has mean 6.20 and dispersion 0.192. That would suggest that the mean deviation and dispersion are swapped, which doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking about the prism's ability to disperse light, so the flint has higher dispersion power, thus higher dispersion. So if the options have flint's dispersion higher than crown's, then option I has flint's dispersion as 0.091, which is lower than crown's 0.192. That's incorrect because flint should have higher dispersion.

Wait, perhaps I should look for an option where flint's mean deviation is higher than crown's and its dispersion is higher as well.

Looking:

Option I: flint mean 5.08, dispersion 0.091; crown 6.20, 0.192. No, wrong.

Option B: flint mean 6.20, dispersion 0.192; crown 5.08, 0.091. Oh, wait! Option B says flint's mean deviation is 6.20°, dispersion 0.192°, and crown's mean is 5.08°, dispersion 0.091°. That matches our calculated mean deviations, but the dispersions are swapped. Because according to our calculation, crown's dispersion is 0.18°, flint's 0.31°, but option B has crown dispersion 0.091 and flint 0.192, which is lower than our calculated values.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck the dispersive power. Crown: v =0.018, flint: v=0.031. So D = v * A = 0.018 *10=0.18 for crown, 0.031*10=0.31 for flint.

So in option B, flint's dispersion is 0.192, which is close to 0.2, but not exactly 0.31. So perhaps there's a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps the question is using A in a different way, or perhaps the formula is different. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the angle in a different way, such as using the formula δ = (n - 1) * A, where A is in degrees, without converting to radians.

Wait, if I calculate mean deviation as δ = (n-1)*A, with A in degrees, then for crown: (1.508-1)*10 =0.508*10=5.08°, correct. For flint: (1.620-1)*10=0.620*10=6.20°, correct.

Dispersion D = v * A, so 0.018 *10=0.18°, 0.031*10=0.31°.

So, looking for an option where flint has mean 6.20, dispersion 0.31, and crown 5.08, 0.18.

But none of the options have this. The closest is option I, but it swaps the two.

Alternatively, perhaps the question has a typo, and the correct answer is not listed, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula for dispersion. Let me think again. I've heard that the dispersion of a prism is given by D = (v) * (n-1) * A. Wait, but that would be v*(n-1)*A, which would be (0.018)*(0.508)*10 = 0.018 *5.08 ≈0.0914°, which matches option B's crown dispersion. Similarly, for flint: 0.031 *0.620 *10 =0.031*6.2≈0.192°, which matches option B's flint dispersion.

Wait, that might be the case. So perhaps the formula for dispersion is D = v * (n-1) * A. Let me think about that. If dispersive power v is defined as v = (n-1)/λ, then the dispersion would be D = v * (n-1) * A. Because D is the product of v, (n-1), and A.

Wait, but that would imply D = [(n-1)/λ] * (n-1) * A = (n-1)^2 * A / λ. That seems a bit off, but perhaps that's the formula used here.

So, let's recalculate using this formula.

For crown: D = 0.018 * (1.508 -1) *10 = 0.018 *0.508 *10 = 0.018 *5.08 ≈0.0914°, which is approximately 0.091°, matching option B's crown dispersion.

For flint: D =0.031 * (1.620-1)*10=0.031 *0.620 *10=0.031*6.20≈0.192°, which matches option B's flint dispersion.

Ah, so perhaps the correct formula for dispersion is D = v * (n-1) * A. That would explain why the options have these values.

So, with this formula, the dispersion for crown is 0.091°, and for flint 0.192°.

So, the mean deviations are:

Crown: δ = (1.508-1)*10 =5.08°

Flint: δ = (1.620-1)*10=6.20°

Dispersion:

Crown: 0.091°, Flint:0.192°

Looking at the options, option B says:

Flint glass: mean deviation 6.20°, dispersion 0.192°; Crown glass: mean deviation 5.08°, dispersion 0.091°.

Yes, that matches our calculations now.
</think>

To solve the problem, we calculate the mean deviation and dispersion for both the crown and flint prisms using the given formulas:

### Mean Deviation
The mean deviation (δ) for a prism is given by:

\[
\delta = (n - 1) \cdot A
\]

where \( n \) is the refractive index and \( A \) is the apex angle in degrees.

- **Crown Prism**: \( n = 1.508 \), \( A = 10^\circ \)
  \[
  \delta_{\text{crown}} = (1.508 - 1) \cdot 10 = 0.508 \cdot 10 = 5.08^\circ
  \]

- **Flint Prism**: \( n = 1.620 \), \( A = 10^\circ \)
  \[
  \delta_{\text{flint}} = (1.620 - 1) \cdot 10 = 0.620 \cdot 10 = 6.20^\circ
  \]

### Dispersion
The dispersion (D) for a prism is given by:

\[
D = v \cdot A
\]

where \( v \) is the dispersive power and \( A \) is the apex angle in degrees.

- **Crown Prism**: \( v = 0.018 \), \( A = 10^\circ \)
  \[
  D_{\text{crown}} = 0.018 \cdot 10 = 0.18^\circ
  \]

- **Flint Prism**: \( v = 0.031 \), \( A = 10^\circ \)
  \[
  D_{\text{flint}} = 0.031 \cdot 10 = 0.31^\circ
  \]

### Matching with Options
From the calculations:
- **Crown Prism**: Mean deviation = \( 5.08^\circ \), Dispersion = \( 0.18^\circ \)
- **Flint Prism**: Mean deviation = \( 6.20^\circ \), Dispersion = \( 0.31^\circ \)

However, none of the options match these exact values. Upon re-evaluating the dispersion formula, it appears the question uses:

\[
D = v \cdot (n - 1) \cdot A
\]

Recomputing dispersion with this formula:
- **Crown Prism**: \( D = 0.018 \cdot 0.508 \cdot 10 = 0.091^\circ \)
- **Flint Prism**: \( D = 0.031 \cdot 0.620 \cdot 10 = 0.192^\circ \)

Now, the values match **Option B**:
- **Flint Prism**: Mean deviation = \( 6.20^\circ \), Dispersion = \( 0.192^\circ \)
- **Crown Prism**: Mean deviation = \( 5.08^\circ \), Dispersion = \( 0.091^\circ \)

Thus, the correct answer is:

**B**

B
