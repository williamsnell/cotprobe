Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the discount rate for this portable color television. The listed price is $280, and the net price after the discount is $196. Hmm, I remember that discount rates are calculated based on the difference between the original price and the discounted price. Let me think about the steps I should take.

First, I need to find out how much the discount is in dollars. That would be the original price minus the net price. So, $280 minus $196. Let me do that calculation: 280 - 196. Let's see, 196 plus 84 is 280, so the discount is $84.

Now that I have the discount amount, I need to find out what percentage this is of the original price. The formula for discount rate is (Discount Amount / Original Price) multiplied by 100 to get the percentage. So that would be (84 / 280) * 100.

Wait, let me compute that. 84 divided by 280. Hmm, 280 goes into 84 how many times? Well, 280 times 0.3 is 84 because 280 times 0.1 is 28, so 0.3 times that is 84. So 0.3 times 100 gives me 30%. 

Let me double-check. If the discount is 30%, then 30% of 280 is 84, which when subtracted from 280 gives 196. Yep, that's correct. So the discount rate is 30%, which corresponds to option B.

I don't think I made any mistakes here. The steps seem straightforward: subtract to find the discount, then divide by the original price and convert to a percentage. Everything adds up, so I'm confident the answer is B.

The discount amount is $84, calculated by subtracting the net price ($196) from the original price ($280). The discount rate is then (84 / 280) * 100 = 30%.
