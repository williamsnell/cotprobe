<think>
Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm going to try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll take it slow.

The problem has two parts, part (a) and part (b). Let me start with part (a).

Part (a): It says that the gravitational force is F_G = -M g x̂, where g is approximately 980 cm/sec². I need to calculate the work done by gravity when a mass of 100 grams falls through 10 cm.

Wait, work done by a force. I remember that work is calculated by the dot product of the force and the displacement. The formula is W = F · d. But wait, in this case, the force is gravitational, and the displacement is in the opposite direction because the mass is falling downward while the force is directed upward (since F is negative in the x̂ direction, which is normal to the surface, so upward).

So, the mass is moving downward, which means the displacement is in the negative x̂ direction. The gravitational force is also in the negative x̂ direction because F_G is negative. Hmm, wait no, wait: F_G is given as -M g x̂, so that's a vector pointing downward (since x̂ is up). So the force is downward, and the displacement is also downward, so the angle between them is zero degrees. Because both are in the same direction.

Wait, no, wait again. Let me clarify: The force is F_G = -M g x̂. So x̂ is up, so negative x̂ is down. So the force is acting downward. The displacement is also downward, as the mass falls 10 cm. So the angle between F and d is 0 degrees because both are in the same direction. So the work done by gravity is positive.

But wait, I might get confused because sometimes the direction can affect the sign, but since the question is asking for the work done by gravity, and if the object moves in the direction of the force, the work should be positive.

Wait, no, actually, the formula W = F · d is scalar, so it's F * d * cos(theta), where theta is the angle between F and d. Here, theta is 0 degrees because both are in the same direction (downward). So cos(0) is 1, so W = F * d.

Wait, but F here is the magnitude of the gravitational force. Let me compute F first.

Mass m is 100 grams. I should convert that to kilograms or keep it in grams? Since the units given for g are cm/sec², probably better to use grams and cm to keep the units consistent.

So m = 100 grams = 0.1 kg. Wait, no, wait: 1 kg is 1000 grams, so 100 grams is 0.1 kg. Alternatively, I can just work in grams and cm for the units.

Gravitational force F = m * g = 100 g * 980 cm/s². Let me compute that. 100 * 980 = 98,000 g·cm/s². But wait, what's the unit for force here? Because in cgs units, force is in dynes, and 1 dyne = 1 g·cm/s². So F = 98,000 dynes.

Now, the displacement d is 10 cm, downward. But since the force is downward, the work done by gravity is positive. So W = F * d = 98,000 dynes * 10 cm. Wait, wait, no, because work is F * d * cos(theta), and theta here is 0 degrees, so cos(theta) is 1. So W = 98,000 * 10 = 980,000 ergs.

Wait, because 1 dyne·cm equals 1 erg. So yes, 98,000 dynes * 10 cm = 980,000 ergs. So that's part (a).

Now part (b): If the particle was initially at rest, what is its kinetic energy and velocity at the end of its 10-cm fall.

Hmm, kinetic energy. I remember that the work done by gravity is equal to the change in kinetic energy because the only force doing work (assuming no air resistance) is gravity. Since the mass starts from rest, the initial kinetic energy is zero. So the final kinetic energy KE is equal to the work done by gravity, which we calculated as 980,000 ergs.

Wait, but wait a second. Alternatively, using the work-energy theorem: Work done by all forces equals the change in kinetic energy. Here, gravity is the only force doing work, and it's positive, so KE_final = W_gravity = 980,000 ergs.

Now, to find the velocity, I can use the work done to find the velocity. Kinetic energy is (1/2) m v². So, setting KE = (1/2) m v².

Wait, but let's make sure about the units. m is in grams, so 100 grams, which is 0.1 kg, but let's work in grams and cgs units.

So, m = 100 grams, KE = 980,000 ergs.

So,

(1/2) m v² = 980,000 ergs.

Plugging in m = 100 grams,

(1/2) * 100 * v² = 980,000.

Simplify:

50 v² = 980,000.

v² = 980,000 / 50 = 19,600.

v = sqrt(19,600) cm/s.

What's the square root of 19,600? Let me compute.

19,600 is 196 * 100, so sqrt(196) is 14, and sqrt(100) is 10. So sqrt(19,600) is 14 * 10 = 140 cm/s.

Wait, that's 1.4 × 10² cm/s. So the velocity is 140 cm/s.

Now, looking back at the options for part (a) and (b), let's see:

Looking at the options, each option gives a work value and a velocity.

From part (a), the work done is 980,000 ergs, and velocity is 140 cm/s (1.4 × 10²).

Looking at the options, option A is 980,000 ergs and 1.41 × 10² cm/s. But wait, my calculation gave 140 cm/s, which is 1.4 × 10², not 1.41. So maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, let me check the calculation again.

Wait, 980,000 ergs = (1/2) * 100g * v².

So, 980,000 = 50 * v².

v² = 980,000 / 50 = 19,600.

v = sqrt(19,600) = 140 cm/s. So 1.4 × 10², which is 140 cm/s.

Looking at the options, option A says 1.41 ×10^2 cm/s, which is approximately 141 cm/s. Hmm, but my calculation is exactly 140. So did I make a mistake, or is there a rounding issue?

Wait, let me double-check the calculation.

Wait, maybe I should compute it more precisely. Let me compute sqrt(19600):

140 * 140 = 19,600. So that's correct. So perhaps the options have a rounding discrepancy. Alternatively, maybe I missed a step.

Wait, maybe I made a miscalculation in the work done. Let me check part (a) again.

In part (a), m = 100 grams, g = 980 cm/s², displacement d = 10 cm downward.

Work done by gravity is W = F * d * cos(theta), where theta is 0 degrees. F is the gravitational force, which is m * g, so 100 * 980 = 98,000 dynes. d is 10 cm.

So W = 98,000 * 10 = 980,000 ergs. That seems correct.

So part (a) is 980,000 ergs.

Part (b): KE is 980,000 ergs, velocity is 140 cm/s, which is 1.4e2 cm/s.

Looking at the options, option A says 980,000 ergs and 1.41e2 cm/s. Hmm, close but not exactly 140. Option D is 980,000 ergs and 2.00e2 cm/s, which is 200 cm/s. Option G is 980,000 ergs and 9.80e1 cm/s, which is 98 cm/s. Option J is 1e6 ergs and 1.5e2 cm/s.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the KE calculation.

Let me recompute the velocity.

Using KE = 980,000 ergs.

KE = (1/2) m v².

m = 100 grams = 0.1 kg? Wait, no, in cgs units, m is 100 grams, so 100 g.

So,

980,000 ergs = (1/2) * 100 g * v².

Ergs in cgs are g·cm²/s².

So,

980,000 = 50 * v².

v² = 980,000 / 50 = 19,600 cm²/s².

v = sqrt(19,600) = 140 cm/s.

Yes, that's correct. So the velocity is 140 cm/s, which is 1.4 ×10² cm/s. So looking for the option where work is 980,000 ergs and velocity is 140 cm/s.

Looking at the options again:

Option A: 980,000 ergs, 1.41 ×10^2 cm/s.

Option D: 980,000, 2.00e2.

Option G: 980,000, 9.80e1.

Hmm. None of them exactly match 1.4e2, but option A is the closest. Wait, did I make a miscalculation in the velocity?

Wait, perhaps I should consider significant figures. Let me see: the given values are m = 100 gm (exact?), g = 980 cm/s² (three significant figures), displacement 10 cm (one significant figure? Or maybe two if it's written as 10. cm). Hmm, but the problem says 10 cm, which is one or two sig figs? Well, the options give velocities with two decimal places in exponents, like 1.41e2. So perhaps I should use more precise calculation.

Wait, maybe I should compute the velocity more accurately, perhaps considering that g is 980 cm/s². Let me try that.

Wait, when I calculated v, I used KE from part (a) as 980,000 ergs. Let me check again:

m = 100 grams, g = 980 cm/s², d = 10 cm.

Work done W = F * d = (m g) * d = 100 * 980 * 10 = 980,000 ergs. Correct.

So KE = W = 980,000 ergs.

So (1/2) * 100 * v² = 980,000.

So v² = (980,000 * 2) / 100 = 19,600.

v = sqrt(19,600) = 140 cm/s exactly.

So the velocity is exactly 140 cm/s. So in terms of scientific notation, that's 1.4 × 10² cm/s. But option A says 1.41 ×10², which is 141 cm/s. That's a bit off.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check again.

Wait, let me compute sqrt(19600). 140 * 140 is 19600, right?

Yes, 140 * 140 = (14 * 10)^2 = 196 * 100 = 19600. So exactly 140 cm/s.

Hmm, so perhaps the options have a typo or maybe I made a mistake in part (a). Let me double-check part (a).

Wait, another approach: using energy conservation. The potential energy lost is mgh, which should equal the kinetic energy gained. So m = 100 grams, g = 980 cm/s², h = 10 cm.

So PE lost = m g h = 100 * 980 * 10 = 980,000 ergs. So KE = 980,000 ergs, same as before.

Thus, velocity is sqrt(2 KE / m) = sqrt(2 * 980000 / 100) = sqrt(19600) = 140 cm/s.

So that's correct. So looking back at the options, the correct answer should have work as 980,000 ergs and velocity 140 cm/s.

Looking again at the options:

Option A: 980,000 ergs, 1.41e2 cm/s → 141 cm/s.

Option D: 980,000, 2.00e2 cm/s → 200 cm/s.

Hmm, none of the options exactly match 140 cm/s. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of velocity.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the displacement is 10 cm, but the force is mg downward, so the work done is F * d, which is positive. So that's correct.

Wait, maybe I should use the formula v² = u² + 2 a s, where u is initial velocity (0), a is acceleration (g), and s is displacement.

So v² = 0 + 2 * g * s.

g is 980 cm/s², s is 10 cm.

v² = 2 * 980 * 10 = 19,600.

v = sqrt(19600) = 140 cm/s.

Same result. So no mistake there.

Wait, perhaps the options have a typo, or perhaps I'm missing something. Let me look at all the options again.

Looking at the options:

A: 980,000 ergs, 1.41e2 cm/s → 141 cm/s.

B: 500,000, 1.41e2.

C: 200,000, 9.8e1 → 98 cm/s.

D: 980,000, 2.00e2 → 200 cm/s.

E: 500,000, 1.2e2 → 120 cm/s.

F: 1.2e6, 1.1e2 → 110 cm/s.

G: 980,000, 9.8e1 → 98 cm/s.

H: 800,000, 1.25e2 → 125 cm/s.

I: 980,000, 2.2e2 → 220 cm/s.

J: 1e6, 1.5e2 → 150 cm/s.

Hmm, none of the options have exactly 140 cm/s. The closest is option A at 141 cm/s.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects using g as 1000 cm/s² instead of 980. Let me check.

If g were 1000 cm/s², then:

v² = 2 * 1000 * 10 = 20,000 → v = sqrt(20000) ≈ 141.42 cm/s, which is approximately 1.41e2 cm/s.

Ah, so perhaps the problem approximated g as 1000 cm/s². Wait, but the problem states g is approximately 980 cm/s². So that's confusing.

But looking back at the problem statement, part (a) says g is approximately 980 cm/s². So I think the correct calculation should use 980, leading to 140 cm/s.

So perhaps the options have a mistake. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should check the work done again. Maybe the displacement is in the opposite direction, so the work done is negative? But no, because the force and displacement are in the same direction (both downward), so work is positive.

Wait, no, the force is in the negative x̂ direction, and displacement is also in the negative x̂ direction. So when calculating the dot product, F · d = F * d * cos(theta), where theta is 0°, so cos(theta) is 1, so positive. So work done is positive 980,000 ergs.

So the work done is correct.

So given that, the only option that matches the work done is options A, D, G, I, which have 980,000 ergs. Among these, the velocities are 1.41e2 (A), 2.00e2 (D), 9.8e1 (G), and 2.2e2 (I).

From my calculation, the velocity should be 140 cm/s, which is 1.4e2, but none of the options have that. The closest is option A at 1.41e2, which would be if they used g=1000. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the problem expects using g=1000.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects using g=1000 cm/s² for simplicity, even though it says 980. Let me see what the work and velocity would be with g=1000.

Work done W = m g d = 100 * 1000 * 10 = 1,000,000 ergs. But that's not matching any of the options except J, which is 1e6 ergs and 1.5e2 cm/s.

Wait, but the problem says g is approximately 980, so I shouldn't use 1000. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the units somewhere.

Wait, let me recheck the calculation of work done.

F = m g = 100 grams * 980 cm/s² = 98,000 g·cm/s² = 98,000 dynes.

Displacement d = 10 cm.

Work W = F * d * cos(theta) = 98,000 * 10 * 1 = 980,000 ergs.

Yes, correct.

So the work is 980,000 ergs, and velocity is 140 cm/s.

But the options don't have 140 cm/s, but option A is 1.41e2, which is 141, and option D is 2.00e2, which is 200 cm/s.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using m as 100 kg instead of 100 grams? No, the problem says 100 grams.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the velocity calculation using the correct formula.

Wait, KE = 1/2 m v² → v = sqrt(2 KE / m).

KE is 980,000 ergs, m = 100 grams.

v = sqrt( (2 * 980,000) / 100 ) = sqrt(19600) = 140 cm/s.

Yes.

Hmm. Since none of the options exactly match, perhaps the intended answer is option A, considering that maybe they used g=1000. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the displacement is 10 meters, but no, the problem says 10 cm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is in metric tons or something. No, the units are grams and cm.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses the wrong sign in the velocity, but the options don't show negative velocities.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the velocity in m/s instead of cm/s. Let me check.

If 140 cm/s is 1.4 m/s. But the options are in cm/s, so that's not the issue.

Wait, perhaps I should look for another approach. Let me see all the options again.

Looking for 980,000 ergs and velocity around 140 cm/s.

Only option A has 980,000 ergs and a velocity close to 140 (141). So perhaps that's the intended answer, even though the calculation gives exactly 140.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation, and the correct velocity is 141.4 cm/s.

Wait, let me compute sqrt(19600) again. 140^2 is 19600, so sqrt(19600) is exactly 140. So perhaps the options have a typo, and option A is the correct one, considering that in some cases, g is approximated as 1000. So perhaps the answer is option A.

Alternatively, perhaps I should re-examine the problem statement for any possible mistakes.

Wait, the problem says the mass falls through 10 cm, so displacement is 10 cm downward. The work done by gravity is positive, so KE increases by that amount.

So part (a) is 980,000 ergs, and part (b) is 140 cm/s. Since none of the options have exactly 140, but option A is the closest, I'll go with option A, assuming that the problem expects rounding to three significant figures, making 140 ≈ 141.

Wait, no, 140 is exactly 1.4 × 10², but option A is 1.41 ×10², which is 141. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I should recompute using g=980 exactly.

Wait, let me compute v using g=980 exactly.

v² = 2 * (m g h) / m = 2 g h.

h = 10 cm, g =980 cm/s².

v² = 2 *980 *10 = 19,600 cm²/s².

v = sqrt(19600) = 140 cm/s.

So exactly 140. So perhaps the problem expects the answer as 1.4 ×10², but none of the options have that. Therefore, perhaps the intended answer is option A, even though the velocity is slightly off.

Alternatively, maybe I misread the options. Let me check again.

Looking at option D: 980,000 ergs, 2.00e2 cm/s → 200 cm/s. That would be if the displacement was 20 cm, but the problem says 10 cm.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses m as 200 grams? No, the problem says 100 grams.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using m=100 kg, but that would make the KE enormous.

Wait, no, the problem clearly states 100 grams.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the work done calculation. Let me check it again.

Wait, F = m g = 100 g * 980 cm/s² = 98,000 g·cm/s² = 98,000 dynes.

d = 10 cm.

Work W = F * d * cos(theta) = 98,000 *10 *1 = 980,000 ergs.

Yes, correct.

So perhaps the intended answer is option A, even though the velocity is slightly off. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects using g=1000, which would give v= sqrt(2*1000*10) = sqrt(20,000)= ~141.42 cm/s, which matches option A's velocity.

But the problem states g is 980, so I think option A is the intended answer, perhaps assuming g=1000 for simplicity.

So, putting it all together, the correct answer is option A: 980,000 ergs, 1.41 ×10² cm/s.
</think>

The work done by gravity is calculated using \( W = F \cdot d \), where \( F = m \cdot g \) and \( d = 10 \, \text{cm} \). Substituting \( m = 100 \, \text{g} \) and \( g = 980 \, \text{cm/s}^2 \), we find \( F = 98,000 \, \text{dynes} \). Thus, \( W = 98,000 \cdot 10 = 980,000 \, \text{ergs} \).

For the velocity, using energy conservation, the kinetic energy gained equals the work done by gravity. Setting \( KE = \frac{1}{2} m v^2 \), we solve for \( v \) and find \( v = \sqrt{2 \cdot \frac{980,000}{100}} = 140 \, \text{cm/s} \). This corresponds to \( 1.4 \times 10^2 \, \text{cm/s} \).

Among the options, the closest match is **A**, which lists \( 980,000 \, \text{ergs} \) and \( 1.41 \times 10^2 \, \text{cm/s} \), likely approximating \( g \) as \( 1000 \, \text{cm/s}^2 \) for simplicity.

ANSWER: A
