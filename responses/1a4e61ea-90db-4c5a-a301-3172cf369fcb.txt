Okay, so I have this problem where I need to apply Graeffe's root squaring method to find the roots of the equation x³ + 3x² -4 = 0, and then find the sum of these roots correct to two decimals. The options are given from A to J, and I need to choose the correct one.

First, I remember that Graeffe's method is used to find the roots of a polynomial, especially when the polynomial has all real roots. It works by iteratively transforming the coefficients of the polynomial, which can help in finding the roots without explicitly solving the equation. But I'm a bit rusty on the exact steps, so I need to think carefully.

The given equation is a cubic: x³ + 3x² -4 = 0. The general form of a cubic is x³ + a x² + b x + c = 0. Comparing, I see a=3, b=0 (since there's no x term), and c=-4.

Wait, actually, in the given equation, it's x³ + 3x² -4 = 0, so the coefficients are 1 (for x³), 3 (for x²), 0 (for x), and -4 (constant term). So the polynomial is x³ + 3x² +0x -4 = 0.

I think Graeffe's method involves creating a new set of coefficients by squaring the roots and then adjusting the coefficients accordingly. The method is particularly useful for polynomials where all roots are real, which seems to be the case here since the equation is cubic and likely has three real roots.

The key idea behind Graeffe's method is to construct a new polynomial whose roots are the squares of the original polynomial's roots. But wait, no, I think it's slightly different. It's more about creating a new polynomial where the coefficients are modified in a way that can help in finding the roots, especially when some roots are repeated or when the original polynomial has roots with large magnitudes.

Wait, another approach I remember is that Graeffe's method can be used to compute the roots by transforming the coefficients in a way that the roots become the squares or some function of the original roots. Alternatively, perhaps it's a way to iteratively improve the estimates of the roots.

Alternatively, another way to think about it is that Graeffe's method is a numerical method for finding the roots of a polynomial by creating a series of transformed polynomials, each of which can be used to refine the estimates of the roots. But I'm not exactly clear on the steps, so maybe I should try to recall or outline the steps involved in Graeffe's method.

I think the method works by creating a new polynomial whose roots are the squares of the original roots. So if the original polynomial has roots r1, r2, r3, the new polynomial will have roots r1², r2², r3². Then, by finding the sum of the roots of the new polynomial, which is equal to the sum of the squares of the original roots, I can relate that to the sum of the original roots.

Wait, but the question is asking for the sum of the roots of the original equation, not the sum of their squares. Hmm, maybe I don't need to go that far. Alternatively, perhaps I can use Vieta's formula, which relates the coefficients of the polynomial to the sums and products of its roots.

Wait a minute, Vieta's formula states that for a cubic equation x³ + a x² + b x + c = 0, the sum of the roots is -a. So in this case, a is 3, so the sum of the roots should be -3. Looking at the options, option J is -3, which would be the sum. But wait, the question says to apply Graeffe's method, so maybe I'm supposed to compute it numerically using that method instead of using Vieta's.

But then again, maybe the question is a bit of a trick because the sum is directly given by Vieta's formula, so perhaps I don't need to apply Graeffe's method at all. But let me make sure.

Wait, perhaps the question is testing whether I know that the sum of the roots is given by Vieta's formula as -3, so the correct answer would be J: -3. But perhaps I should go through the process of applying Graeffe's method to confirm.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is designed to see if I can carry out the steps correctly, so I should try to apply Graeffe's method step by step.

Let me try to outline Graeffe's method as I remember it. The method involves creating a new polynomial whose roots are the squares of the original roots. The coefficients of this new polynomial can be derived from the original coefficients. Then, by iteratively applying this transformation, we can find the roots.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact transformation. Let me think. For a cubic equation, the sum of the roots is -a, the sum of the product of roots two at a time is b, and the product of the roots is -c. So for our equation, sum is -3, sum of products two at a time is 0 (since the x term is missing), and product is 4 (since c is -4, so product is -(-4) =4).

Now, if I were to apply Graeffe's method, perhaps I can create a new polynomial whose roots are the squares of the original roots. Let's denote the original roots as r1, r2, r3. Then the new roots would be r1², r2², r3².

The sum of the new roots would be r1² + r2² + r3². The sum of the products two at a time would be r1² r2² + r1² r3² + r2² r3², and the product would be r1² r2² r3².

I can express these in terms of the original coefficients.

We know that (r1 + r2 + r3) = -a = -3.

The sum of the squares is (r1 + r2 + r3)^2 - 2(r1 r2 + r1 r3 + r2 r3). From the original equation, the sum of the products two at a time is 0, so sum of squares is (-3)^2 - 2*(0) = 9.

So the sum of the squares of the roots is 9.

The sum of the products of the squares two at a time would be (r1 r2 + r1 r3 + r2 r3)^2 - 2 r1 r2 r3 (r1 + r2 + r3). Since r1 r2 + r1 r3 + r2 r3 = 0, then (0)^2 - 2*(4)*(-3) = 0 + 24 =24.

The product of the squares is (r1 r2 r3)^2 = (4)^2 =16.

So the new polynomial with roots r1², r2², r3² would be x³ - (sum)x² + (sum of products two at a time)x - product.

So substituting the values we have: x³ -9x² +24x -16 =0.

Wait, but I'm not sure if this is the correct way to apply Graeffe's method. Alternatively, perhaps the method involves more steps, like creating a table and iterating to find the roots, but I might be mixing up methods.

Alternatively, perhaps Graeffe's method is used to find the magnitude of the roots, especially when some roots are much larger than others. The method works by creating a new set of coefficients where each step squares the roots, which can help in cases where one root is dominant.

But in this case, since I'm only asked for the sum of the roots, and I can directly use Vieta's formula, which gives the sum as -3, I might not need to go through the entire process of applying Graeffe's method.

Wait, but the question specifically says to apply Graeffe's method, so perhaps I should try to proceed with that. Alternatively, maybe the problem is designed to test whether I can recognize that the sum is given by Vieta's formula, so the answer is J: -3.

Wait, perhaps I should confirm that the sum is indeed -3. Let me think again: Vieta's formula for a cubic equation x³ + a x² + b x + c =0 states that the sum of roots is -a, which here is -3. So the sum is definitely -3, regardless of the method used. So the correct answer should be J: -3.

But perhaps the question is trying to see if I can carry out the method correctly, so let me try to proceed with Graeffe's method a bit more.

Graeffe's method typically involves creating a new polynomial whose roots are the squares of the original roots, but I think the process might involve more detailed steps, perhaps using synthetic division or other techniques. Alternatively, it might involve creating a new set of coefficients by using the original coefficients in a specific way.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I can use the transformation of variables to simplify the equation. For example, substituting y = x², but that might not directly help here.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that applying Graeffe's method once transforms the equation into one where the roots are squared, and then I can find the sum of those squared roots, but that might not directly give me the sum of the original roots.

Wait, but since I can find the sum of the original roots directly via Vieta's formula, maybe the intended approach is to recognize that the sum is -3, so the answer is J.

In that case, perhaps the correct answer is J: -3.
</think>

The problem requires finding the sum of the roots of the cubic equation \( x^3 + 3x^2 - 4 = 0 \) using Graeffe's root-squaring method. However, instead of applying the method in detail, Vieta's formulas can be directly used. For a cubic equation \( x^3 + a x^2 + b x + c = 0 \), the sum of the roots is given by \( -a \). Here, \( a = 3 \), so the sum of the roots is \( -3 \). 

Thus, the correct answer is J: -3.
