Alright, so I'm trying to figure out the correct answer to this question about West's account regarding women who engage in undesired sex due to dependence on their partner. The question is asking why their sense of autonomy is injured. Let me break it down.

First, I'll restate the question to make sure I understand it. The scenario is women having sex they don't want because they feel or are actually dependent on their partner. This dependence leads to an injury in their sense of autonomy. So, the question is about the reason behind this autonomy injury.

Looking at the options, I need to pick the one that best explains why their autonomy is hurt. Let's go through each option.

Option A: They are dominated by their partners insofar as they are not free to do as they please. That sounds plausible because if someone is dominated, they lose their freedom to make choices, which affects autonomy.

Option B: They are actually coerced into having sex. Coercion is a form of force, but the question mentions "actual or felt dependence." So, it's not necessarily physical coercion but more about feeling dependent, maybe emotional or financial dependence.

Option C: They are financially dependent on their partners. This is a specific type of dependence. While financial dependence can lead to coercion, the question is more general about dependence, not just financial.

Option D: They fear the consequences of refusing their partner. Fear of consequences could be a reason, but it's more about the outcome of refusal rather than the autonomy issue itself.

Option E: They have not established boundaries in their relationship. Not having boundaries does contribute to autonomy issues, but the question is about why their autonomy is injured due to dependence.

Option F: None of the above. This would be the choice if none fit, but let me check the others first.

Option G: Their partner uses manipulation tactics to coerce them into sex. Manipulation is a form of coercion, but again, the question is about dependence, not necessarily overt manipulation.

Option H: They feel obliged to fulfill their partner's sexual desires. Obligation could stem from dependence, but it's more about feeling responsible rather than the cause of autonomy loss.

Option I: They feel a sense of obligation due to societal pressures. Societal pressure is another factor, but the question specifies dependence on the partner, not broader societal issues.

Option J: They have neglected to take whatever steps would lead to their self-sustenance. Self-sustenance is about independence, but this seems a bit off from the immediate issue of dependence on a partner.

Now, considering West's account, the key here is the sense of autonomy being injured because of dependence. Autonomy is about self-governance and freedom to make choices. If someone feels or is actually dependent, they might feel they can't make their own choices, hence their autonomy is compromised.

Option A talks about being dominated, meaning they're not free to do as they please. That directly impacts autonomy because they feel controlled. Option B is about coercion, which is more about force, but the question mentions dependence, which could be more about feeling pressured or controlled without actual force.

Option C is specific to financial dependence, but the question is broader. Option D is about fear of consequences, which is a separate reason but not necessarily the root cause of autonomy loss due to dependence.

So, between A and F. The question is whether the answer is among the options or none. Since the question is about autonomy injury due to dependence, which implies a loss of freedom to choose, Option A seems to fit because it's about being dominated and not free to choose, hence autonomy is injured.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. The question says "because of actual or felt dependence." So, the reason their autonomy is injured is because they feel dependent. Option A says they are dominated because they're not free to do as they please. That seems to fit because being dominated implies loss of autonomy.

Alternatively, Option H says they feel obliged, which could be a result of dependence. But the question is about why their autonomy is injured. Feeling obliged is a symptom, but the cause is the dependence leading to domination.

So, I think the best answer is A.

The question asks why women who engage in undesired sex due to dependence on their partner experience injury to their sense of autonomy. The key is understanding that autonomy is about self-governance and freedom to make choices. Dependence can lead to a feeling of being dominated, which directly impacts autonomy by restricting their ability to choose freely.

Option A explains that they are dominated, meaning they are not free to do as they please, which aligns with the concept of autonomy injury due to dependence. Other options, like coercion or fear, are related but do not specifically address the root cause of autonomy loss tied to dependence.

Answer: A
