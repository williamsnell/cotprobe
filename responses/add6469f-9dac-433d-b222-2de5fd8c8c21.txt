<think>
Okay, so I have this hypothesis testing question here, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let me go through it step by step.

The question is about determining which combination of significance level (α) and sample size (n) gives the greatest power when the true mean μ is 65. The null hypothesis is H0: μ = 70, and the alternative is Ha: μ < 70, which is a one-tailed test.

First, I remember that the power of a test is the probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis when the alternative hypothesis is true. So, higher power means a greater chance of detecting that μ is actually less than 70 when it is.

Power depends on a few factors: the significance level α, the sample size n, the effect size, and the standard deviation. Since the standard deviation isn't given, I have to work with what's provided in the options.

The formula for power relates to the z-score. The power is calculated by finding the probability that the test statistic falls in the rejection region under the alternative hypothesis. The steps are:

1. Calculate the critical value under H0.
2. Calculate the z-score under Ha.
3. Find the area beyond the critical value under Ha, which gives the power.

Alternatively, I think about how increasing the sample size increases the power because the standard error (σ/√n) decreases, making the distribution more precise. A higher α (like 0.1 instead of 0.05) also increases the power because the rejection region is larger, making it easier to reject H0. But wait, higher α means more Type I error, but for a given effect, higher α increases power.

Wait, no, wait. The question is about which option gives the greatest power. So, I need to compare the options based on how α and n affect power.

Looking at the options:

A: α=0.05, n=15
B: α=0.01, n=30
C: α=0.05, n=45
D: α=0.01, n=45
E: α=0.05, n=30
F: α=0.1, n=30
G: α=0.01, n=15
H: α=0.02, n=25
I: α=0.1, n=45
J: α=0.1, n=15

I think I should consider both α and n. Higher n and higher α (if possible) would both contribute to higher power.

Let me think about how each option's α and n affect power.

First, for a given effect, a larger sample size increases the power because the test is more sensitive. So, between options with the same α, the one with larger n has higher power.

Similarly, for a given sample size, a higher α (more lenient significance level) increases power because the critical region is larger, making it easier to reject H0.

Wait, but in this case, the alternative is μ=65, which is 5 units below H0's 70. So the effect size is 5. The effect size relative to the standard deviation is 5/σ, but since σ isn't given, we can't compute it numerically, but the effect is fixed at 5.

Now, to calculate the power, I think about the formula involving the non-centrality parameter. The power is the probability that the sample mean is less than the critical value under H0, but calculated under Ha.

Alternatively, the power can be seen as 1 - β, where β is the probability of Type II error.

To compute the critical value for H0, we use the formula:

Critical value (z-score) = z_α

For a one-tailed test, α is the area to the left. So for α=0.05, z= -1.645 (since it's left-tailed). For α=0.01, z=-2.326. For α=0.1, z=-1.282.

Under Ha, the mean is 65. The z-score for the critical value under Ha is:

z = (X̄ - μa) / (σ/√n)

Wait, but without σ, maybe I can think in terms of the distance from the critical value.

The critical value under H0 is at μ0 + z_α * (σ/√n). Wait, no, it's the other way around. Let me correct that.

Wait, the critical value for the test statistic (like X̄) is μ0 + z_α * (σ/√n). Wait, no, actually, the critical value is determined under H0. So, under H0, the sampling distribution of X̄ is N(μ0, σ²/n). The critical value is such that P(X̄ < critical value | H0) = α.

So, the critical value is μ0 + z_α * (σ/√n).

Under Ha, the true mean is μa = 65. So the z-score for the critical value under Ha is:

z_power = (critical value - μa) / (σ/√n)

Which is [(μ0 + z_α * (σ/√n)) - μa] / (σ/√n)

Simplify that:

= [ (μ0 - μa) + z_α * (σ/√n) ] / (σ/√n)
= (μ0 - μa)/(σ/√n) + z_α

= (√n (μ0 - μa))/σ + z_α

So the power is the probability that Z > z_power, because under Ha, the distribution is shifted left.

Wait, no. Wait, the test is H0: μ=70 vs Ha: μ<70. So it's a left-tailed test. The critical value is at the lower end.

If the true mean is 65, which is less than 70, the power is the probability that X̄ is less than the critical value (i.e., falls into the rejection region). So the power is P(X̄ < critical value | μ=65).

So the z-score for the critical value under Ha is:

z = (critical_value - μa) / (σ/√n)

But the critical value is μ0 + z_alpha * (σ/√n). So:

z = [ (μ0 + z_alpha * (σ/√n)) - μa ] / (σ/√n)
= (μ0 - μa + z_alpha * (σ/√n)) / (σ/√n)
= (μ0 - μa)/(σ/√n) + z_alpha

Which simplifies to:

z = (√n (μ0 - μa))/σ + z_alpha

Wait, but μ0 is 70, μa is 65, so μ0 - μa is 5.

So z = (5 * √n)/σ + z_alpha

Wait, but wait, because (μ0 - μa) is positive, but under Ha, μa is less than μ0, so the mean is shifted to the left. So when we compute z, it's actually the distance from the critical value to the new mean, which is 5 units below μ0.

Wait, perhaps I should think about it as:

The critical value under H0 is at a certain point. Under Ha, the distribution is shifted left by 5 units (since μa = 65). So the distance between the critical value and the new mean is (μ0 - μa) - (z_alpha * σ/√n), but I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the power using the formula:

Power = P(Z < z_critical - (μ0 - μa)/(σ/√n) )

Wait, no, I think I'm mixing up terms. Let me try a different approach.

The critical value under H0 is:

X̄_critical = μ0 + z_alpha * (σ/√n)

Under Ha, the mean is μa = 65. So the z-score for X̄_critical under Ha is:

z = (X̄_critical - μa) / (σ/√n)
= [μ0 + z_alpha*(σ/√n) - μa] / (σ/√n)
= [ (μ0 - μa) + z_alpha*(σ/√n) ] / (σ/√n)
= (μ0 - μa)/(σ/√n) + z_alpha

Which is:

= (5)/(σ/√n) + z_alpha

So the power is the probability that Z < z, which is Φ(z), where Φ is the standard normal CDF. Wait, but since it's a left-tailed test, the power is the probability that X̄ < X̄_critical, which under Ha is P(X̄ < X̄_critical) = Φ(z).

Wait, but I'm getting a bit tangled up. Maybe a better way is to compute the non-centrality parameter, which is:

delta = (μa - μ0)/(σ/√n) = (65 - 70)/(σ/√n) = (-5)/(σ/√n)

But since we're dealing with a left-tailed test, the power is the probability that Z < (X̄_critical - μa)/(σ/√n).

Wait, X̄_critical is the point where, under H0, P(X̄ < X̄_critical) = α. So under Ha, the power is P(X̄ < X̄_critical | μ=65).

Which can be written as:

Power = Φ( (X̄_critical - μa) / (σ/√n) )

But X̄_critical = μ0 + z_alpha * (σ/√n)

So substituting:

Power = Φ( [μ0 + z_alpha*(σ/√n) - μa] / (σ/√n) )

Simplify numerator:

(μ0 - μa) + z_alpha*(σ/√n) 

Divide by (σ/√n):

[(μ0 - μa)/(σ/√n)] + z_alpha

Which is:

(5)/(σ/√n) + z_alpha

So the argument to Φ is (5√n)/(σ) + z_alpha.

Wait, but since the alternative is μ < 70, the test is left-tailed. So the power is the probability that the test statistic is less than the critical value, which under Ha is:

Power = P(Z < (X̄_critical - μa)/(σ/√n)) 

Which is Φ( (X̄_critical - μa)/(σ/√n) )

Which as we've found is Φ( (5√n)/(σ) + z_alpha )

Wait, but wait, I think I made a mistake in the sign. Because μa is 65, which is less than μ0 (70), the numerator becomes (70 + z_alpha*(σ/√n) -65) = 5 + z_alpha*(σ/√n). So the argument is (5 + z_alpha*(σ/√n)) / (σ/√n) = 5/(σ/√n) + z_alpha.

So the argument is (5√n)/σ + z_alpha.

But since σ is the same for both H0 and Ha, and it's in the denominator, higher n would make this term larger, which would make Φ() larger, thus higher power.

Wait, but Φ() is the CDF for Z, so if the argument is larger (positive), Φ() is higher. So higher n increases the argument, leading to higher power.

But wait, the critical value is computed under H0, which is at a certain z_alpha. So when μa is lower, the distance between the two distributions is 5 units. So the bigger n is, the more the sample mean will cluster around the true mean, making it easier to fall below the critical value.

So, for a given n, a smaller α (like 0.01) makes z_alpha more negative, which would lower the argument, but wait, no: z_alpha is the critical value under H0. For a left-tailed test, α=0.05 corresponds to z_alpha=-1.645, α=0.01 is z=-2.326, and α=0.1 is z=-1.282.

So the argument in Φ is (5√n)/σ + z_alpha.

Wait, but wait, z_alpha is negative. For example, if α=0.05, z_alpha=-1.645. So the argument becomes (5√n)/σ - 1.645.

Wait, but that can't be right because if n is large enough, (5√n)/σ would dominate, making the argument positive, which would make Φ() approach 1, meaning power approaches 1.

Wait, perhaps I should think of it as:

The non-centrality parameter is (μa - μ0)/(σ/√n) = (65-70)/(σ/√n) = (-5)/(σ/√n) = -5√n/σ.

But since the test is left-tailed, the power is the probability that Z < z_alpha + (μa - μ0)/(σ/√n).

Wait, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should look up the formula for power in a one-sample z-test.

The power of a test is given by:

Power = Φ(z_alpha + (μa - μ0)/(σ/√n))

But wait, since it's a left-tailed test, the formula is:

Power = P(Z < z_alpha + (μa - μ0)/(σ/√n))

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to think of the test statistic under Ha. The critical value under H0 is at z_alpha. Under Ha, the distribution is shifted, so the power is the probability that the test statistic under Ha is less than the critical value.

So the test statistic under Ha has a mean of (μa - μ0)/(σ/√n) = -5√n/σ. So the z-score for the critical value is z_alpha, and the power is the probability that a normally distributed variable with mean -5√n/σ is less than z_alpha.

Wait, that might not be correct. Let me try again.

The critical value in terms of the test statistic is z_alpha. Under Ha, the distribution of the test statistic is N( (μa - μ0)/(σ/√n), 1 ). So the power is P( Z < z_alpha | Ha ), which is Φ( z_alpha - (μa - μ0)/(σ/√n) )

Wait, because the mean of Z under Ha is (μa - μ0)/(σ/√n) = -5√n/σ.

So the power is Φ( z_alpha - (μa - μ0)/(σ/√n) )

Which is Φ( z_alpha - (-5√n/σ) ) = Φ( z_alpha + 5√n/σ )

But wait, since z_alpha is negative (because it's a left-tailed test), adding a positive term (5√n/σ) would bring it closer to zero, increasing the power.

Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as:

Power = P( X̄ < X̄_critical | μ=65 )

Which is the same as P( Z < (X̄_critical - 65)/(σ/√n) )

But X̄_critical is μ0 + z_alpha*(σ/√n) = 70 + z_alpha*(σ/√n)

So (X̄_critical - 65)/(σ/√n) = (70 + z_alpha*(σ/√n) -65)/(σ/√n) = (5 + z_alpha*(σ/√n)) / (σ/√n) = 5/(σ/√n) + z_alpha

Which is (5√n)/σ + z_alpha

So the power is Φ( (5√n)/σ + z_alpha )

Since Φ() is the CDF, a larger argument means higher power.

So, to maximize the power, we want to maximize (5√n)/σ + z_alpha.

But σ is the same for all options, so it's proportional to (5√n) + z_alpha * σ. Hmm, but without knowing σ, perhaps we can treat it as a constant factor.

Wait, but all options share the same σ, so we can compare based on (5√n + z_alpha * (σ)) since σ is constant. But since σ is in the denominator, maybe that complicates things. Alternatively, perhaps we can ignore σ since it's a constant across all options and focus on (5√n + z_alpha * k), where k is some constant.

But perhaps a better approach is to consider that for each option, the power increases with larger n and with more lenient α (smaller |z_alpha|, since z_alpha is negative).

Wait, because z_alpha is negative for left-tailed tests. So a larger α (like 0.1) gives a more negative z_alpha, which when added to (5√n/σ), may or may not increase the overall value.

Wait, let me think numerically. Suppose σ is 10 for example (though it's not given, but just to have a number). Let's pick n and α and compute (5√n)/10 + z_alpha.

For example:

Option A: α=0.05, n=15

z_alpha = -1.645

(5√15)/10 ≈ (5*3.872)/10 ≈ 19.36/10 ≈ 1.936

So total is 1.936 + (-1.645) ≈ 0.291

Power is Φ(0.291) ≈ 0.614

Option C: α=0.05, n=45

z_alpha=-1.645

5√45 ≈5*6.708≈33.54

33.54/10=3.354

3.354 + (-1.645)=1.709

Φ(1.709)≈0.957

Option F: α=0.1, n=30

z_alpha=-1.282

5√30≈5*5.477≈27.385

27.385/10=2.7385

2.7385 + (-1.282)=1.4565

Φ(1.4565)≈0.928

Option I: α=0.1, n=45

z_alpha=-1.282

5√45≈33.54

33.54/10=3.354

3.354 + (-1.282)=2.072

Φ(2.072)= ~0.981

Option J: α=0.1, n=15

z_alpha=-1.282

5√15≈19.36

19.36/10=1.936

1.936 + (-1.282)=0.654

Φ(0.654)= ~0.744

Comparing these:

A: ~0.614

C: ~0.957

F: ~0.928

I: ~0.981

J: ~0.744

So among these, option I has the highest power.

But wait, let's check other options as well.

Option B: α=0.01, n=30

z_alpha=-2.326

5√30≈27.385

27.385/10=2.7385

2.7385 + (-2.326)=0.4125

Φ(0.4125)= ~0.659

Option D: α=0.01, n=45

z_alpha=-2.326

5√45≈33.54

33.54/10=3.354

3.354 + (-2.326)=1.028

Φ(1.028)= ~0.848

Option E: α=0.05, n=30

z_alpha=-1.645

5√30≈27.385

27.385/10=2.7385

2.7385 + (-1.645)=1.0935

Φ(1.0935)= ~0.862

Option G: α=0.01, n=15

z_alpha=-2.326

5√15≈19.36

19.36/10=1.936

1.936 + (-2.326)= -0.39

Φ(-0.39)= ~0.348

Option H: α=0.02, n=25

z_alpha=-2.054 (since for α=0.02 left-tailed, z_alpha≈-2.054)

5√25=5*5=25

25/10=2.5

2.5 + (-2.054)=0.446

Φ(0.446)= ~0.671

So, looking at all options, the power is highest in option I, where α=0.1, n=45.

Wait, but in my example with σ=10, option I had power ~0.981, which is higher than others.

But wait, the question is about which option gives the highest power. So in my example, option I is the best. But does this hold for any σ?

Well, since σ is in the denominator, but all options have the same σ, the relative performance remains the same. So the one with the largest (5√n/σ + z_alpha) will have the highest power.

So, in this case, option I: α=0.1, n=45.

Wait, but let me check another σ to be sure. Suppose σ=5.

Option I:

5√45=5*6.708≈33.54

33.54/5=6.708

z_alpha=-1.282

So 6.708 + (-1.282)=5.426

Φ(5.426)= practically 1.

Another option, option C: α=0.05, n=45

5√45=33.54

33.54/5=6.708

z_alpha=-1.645

6.708 + (-1.645)=5.063

Φ(5.063)≈1, but slightly less than option I.

So in this case, option I still has higher power.

Wait, but in reality, σ is the same for all options, so the one with the highest (5√n + |z_alpha| * σ) will have the highest power.

Wait, but I'm making an assumption about σ. Since σ isn't given, perhaps the correct approach is to recognize that for a given effect, larger n and larger α (lower significance level, but wait, higher α) give higher power.

Wait, but α is the significance level. Higher α means a larger critical value in the left tail, making it easier to reject H0, thus increasing power.

So, among the options, the combination of the largest n and the highest α will give the highest power.

Looking back, option I has α=0.1 (highest α among the options) and n=45 (one of the largest n's). Option C has α=0.05 and n=45, which is also good, but α=0.1 is higher, so option I should have higher power than C.

Similarly, option F has α=0.1 and n=30, which is less n than I. So I should have higher power.

So the answer should be option I.
</think>

To determine which combination of significance level (α) and sample size (n) results in the greatest power for the hypothesis test, we analyze how α and n affect the power. Power is the probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis when the alternative hypothesis is true. It increases with a higher sample size (n) and a higher α (more lenient significance level).

The power of a test is influenced by the non-centrality parameter, which depends on the effect size, sample size, and significance level. For a given effect size (μ = 65 vs. μ = 70), larger n increases the power because the standard error decreases, making the test more sensitive. A higher α also increases power by expanding the rejection region, making it easier to reject the null hypothesis.

We evaluate the options:

- **Option I (α = 0.1, n = 45)**: Combines the highest α and a large n, maximizing the power.
- **Option C (α = 0.05, n = 45)**: High n but lower α than Option I, resulting in slightly less power.
- **Option F (α = 0.1, n = 30)**: Moderate n and high α, but less power than Option I due to smaller n.
- Other options have either smaller n or lower α, leading to lower power.

Thus, Option I, with the highest α and largest n, provides the greatest power.
