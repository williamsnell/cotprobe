Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about comparing electrostatic and gravitational forces between an electron and a proton. Let me think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to recall what I know.

First, I remember that both forces are fundamental and act between particles. But the nature of these forces is quite different. Electrostatic forces are the ones that act between charged particles, right? So electrons and protons have opposite charges, which means the electrostatic force between them is attractive. On the other hand, gravitational force is always attractive too, but it's based on mass.

I think about Coulomb's Law for electrostatic forces. The formula is F_e = k * |q1 * q2| / r², where k is Coulomb's constant. For gravitational force, Newton's law of universal gravitation says F_g = G * (m1 * m2) / r², where G is the gravitational constant.

So both forces are inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the particles. But the key difference here is in the constants and the charges/masses involved. Coulomb's constant k is much larger than G. Also, the charges of elementary particles like electrons and protons are significant compared to their masses.

Wait, the charges of an electron and proton are ±1.6e-19 coulombs each. Their masses are much smaller compared to the charges when considering the constants. So plugging into the formulas, the electrostatic force should be way stronger than the gravitational force at the same distance.

Looking at the options:

Option E says the electrostatic force is enormously greater. That makes sense because Coulomb's law with those charges would result in a much larger force than gravitational, which depends on much smaller masses.

Option J says the electrostatic force is only slightly greater. That doesn't seem right because I've heard that electric forces are vastly stronger than gravitational in such interactions.

Option G suggests that gravitational force increases when particles are closer, making it stronger than electrostatic at short distances. Wait, no. Both forces decrease with the square of the distance, so at very short distances, maybe the gravitational force isn't weaker? Wait, but wait, the constants are so different. Coulomb's constant is about 8.988e9 N·m²/C², while G is about 6.674e-11 N·m²/kg². So for the same r, the electric force is much stronger. Even at very small r, unless r is extremely small, the electric force would dominate. So G's statement doesn't seem correct.

Option D says gravitational forces can be ignored because they're balanced by electrostatic. That sounds familiar. Like in atoms, the electric attraction between electrons and protons (nucleus) is so strong that gravitational is negligible. So D might be correct, but the question is about comparing the forces, not about whether one can be ignored.

Wait the question is asking to compare the forces. So D is more about the effect in systems, not the comparison itself. So the main point is whether E is correct.

So, the electrostatic force is much greater than gravitational. So E is correct. Let me check other options.

Option E: The electrostatic force between elementary particles is enormously greater than the gravitational force. Yes, that sounds right. Because the charges are significant, and the constants are much larger.

Option J seems to suggest it's only slightly greater, which I don't think is correct. It's not just slightly; it's by many orders of magnitude.

So the answer should be E.

The electrostatic force between an electron and a proton is enormously greater than the gravitational force due to the significantly larger constant in Coulomb's law compared to Newton's gravitational constant, as well as the charges involved being much more substantial than the masses. 

Answer: E
