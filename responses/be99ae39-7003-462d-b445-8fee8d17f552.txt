Okay, I need to figure out the answer to this multiple-choice question. The question is asking about the ability to make inferences about a population based on a sample. Let me break it down.

So, the question is about statistical terms related to research methods. The key here is understanding what each term means.

The options given are A through J, each with different terms. Let me recall each term.

Option A: Reliability. I think reliability refers to the consistency of a measure. Like, if you measure something twice, you get the same result. It's about whether the results are stable and repeatable.

Option B: Face validity. That's more about whether the measure appears to be valid to the people involved. Like, does the test look like it's measuring what it's supposed to measure?

Option C: Internal validity. Internal validity is about whether the experiment actually measures what it's intended to measure, without other factors interfering. It's about whether the variables are correctly related.

Option D: External validity. External validity is about whether the results can be generalized to other settings, groups, or times. So, can we apply findings from the sample to the larger population?

Option E: Statistical significance. This refers to whether the results are likely due to the variables being tested and not chance. It's about the probability of the results being real.

Option F: Criterion validity. This is when a measure correlates with a criterion measure. So, it's about how well a test predicts or correlates with an external measure.

Option G: Content validity. This is about whether the measure covers all aspects of the construct it's supposed to measure. Like, does the test include all the relevant content?

Option H: Convergent validity. This is when a measure correlates with other measures that should be related to it. It's about whether the test correlates with similar tests.

Option I: Inter-rater reliability. This is about whether different raters or judges give consistent results. So, agreement between scorers.

Option J: Construct validity. This is about whether a measure accurately reflects the theoretical construct it's supposed to measure. It involves evidence that the test is measuring the underlying concept.

The question is about making inferences from a sample to a population. That sounds like generalizability, which is external validity. So, external validity (D) is the ability to apply sample results to the broader population.

Wait, but I should double-check. Internal validity is about whether the variables caused the effect, not about generalizability. So, yes, external validity is about generalizing the findings.

Another way to think: If a study has high external validity, you can confidently say that the results apply to the population beyond the sample. That's exactly what the question is asking.

The ability to make inferences about a population from a sample is referred to as **external validity**. This concept pertains to the generalizability of the study's findings to settings and groups beyond the sample. 

Answer: D
