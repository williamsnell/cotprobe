Okay, so I've got this analogy question here, and I need to figure out the correct answer. The question is: “Vision is to hearing as __.” The options are all pairs of brain lobes. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, I know that analogies often involve relationships between things. So "Vision is to hearing as..." probably relates parts of the brain associated with those senses. Vision is related to seeing, and hearing is related to listening. I remember that different parts of the brain handle different senses.

Wait, in the brain, each sense is processed in specific lobes. The occipital lobe is responsible for vision, right? Because when you see something, the visual information is sent to the occipital lobe at the back of the brain. On the other hand, hearing is handled by the temporal lobe. So the temporal lobe processes sounds and hearing.

So the analogy is comparing vision (occipital lobe) to hearing (temporal lobe). Therefore, the structure should be: Vision (occipital) is to hearing (temporal) as... something. Wait, the question is phrased as "Vision is to hearing as..." and the options are pairs of lobes. So the correct completion should be the lobe for vision to the lobe for hearing, meaning occipital to temporal.

Looking at the options, let's see which one matches that. Option G says occipital lobe is to temporal lobe. That fits because vision is handled by occipital and hearing by temporal. So the analogy would be Vision : Hearing :: Occipital : Temporal.

Wait, but let me make sure. The options are A to J. Let me check each option:

A: parietal to frontal – No, those are for different functions like touch and movement, maybe.

B: temporal to parietal – No, that's hearing to touch/sensory/motor.

C: temporal to frontal – Frontal is for things like decision-making, not directly senses.

D: occipital to parietal – Par is for touch or body sensations, not hearing.

E: par to occipital – Opposite, maybe.

F: par to temporal – Hmm, parietal is for touch, so that would be touch to hearing. Not the analogy we need.

G: occipital to temporal – Yes, that's vision to hearing.

H: frontal to parietal – Frontal is more about higher functions, not directly senses.

I: frontal to occipital – No, that's not relevant.

J: occipital to frontal – Frontal is for different things, not hearing.

So the correct answer should be G: occipital lobe is to temporal lobe.

The analogy compares vision to hearing, which correspond to the occipital lobe and temporal lobe, respectively. Therefore, the correct completion is "occipital lobe is to temporal lobe."

Answer: G
