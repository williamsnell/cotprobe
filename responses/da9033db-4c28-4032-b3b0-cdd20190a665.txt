Okay, so here's the question: In a group of 10 scores, the largest score is increased by 40 points. What will happen to the mean?

Hmm, let me think about this. I remember that the mean is the average of all the scores. So to find the mean, you add up all the scores and then divide by the number of scores, which in this case is 10.

So, originally, let's say the sum of all 10 scores is S. That means the mean is S divided by 10. Now, the largest score is increased by 40 points. So the new sum becomes S plus 40. 

Wait, so the new mean would be (S + 40) divided by 10. Let me calculate the difference between the new mean and the old mean. 

Old mean: S/10
New mean: (S + 40)/10
Difference: [(S + 40)/10] - [S/10] = (40)/10 = 4.

So the mean increases by 4 points. That would mean the answer is J: It will increase by 4 points.

Let me double-check. Suppose all the other scores are the same, and only the largest one goes up by 40. So the total sum goes up by 40, and since there are 10 scores, each point in the mean increases by 40/10 = 4. Yep, that makes sense. So the correct answer is J.

The mean increases by 4 points because adding 40 to one of the scores increases the total sum by 40, and dividing by 10 gives a 4-point increase in the mean.

Answer: J
