Okay, so I've got this question about Nussbaum and cross-cultural communication. Hmm, I remember Nussbaum is a philosopher, maybe from the 20th century. The question is about how people from different conceptual schemes view their interactions. The options are various philosophers' ways of thinking.

First, I need to think about what Nussbaum's stance is on cross-cultural communication. From what I recall, she's critical of certain approaches. I think she wrote about this in her book "Frontiers of Justice." She argues against using a purely Kantian approach because it might not account for the emotional and psychological aspects of interactions, especially in cross-cultural settings.

Wait, so the question is asking how inhabitants of different conceptual schemes tend to view their interactions. If Nussbaum is against a Kantian approach, maybe she suggests that they don't see it in a Kantian way. But the options are about how they view their interactions, so perhaps she's saying they don't align with one particular philosopher's method.

Looking at the options, E is Kantian. So if Nussbaum claims they don't view it that way, then the answer might be E. But wait, the question is phrased as "tend to view their interaction," so maybe she's saying they don't fit into one specific framework, or maybe she's suggesting a different approach.

Alternatively, maybe I'm mixing her up with someone else. Let me think: Nussbaum is known for her work on emotions and capability theory. She critiques Kant for being too rational and not considering the intersubjective or emotional aspects. So in cross-cultural interactions, people might not approach things in a purely Kantian way, which relies on rational maxims and duties.

So if the question is about how they view interactions, and Nussbaum is against a Kantian approach, then the correct answer would be E: in a Kantian way, because she claims they don't do that. Wait, no, the question is asking what they tend to view it as. So if she's against Kantian, then perhaps they don't view it that way. So the answer would be that they don't view it in a Kantian way, meaning the correct option is E, implying that's not how they see it.

Wait, but the question is phrased as "tend to view their interaction." So if Nussbaum is saying they don't view it in a Kantian way, then the correct answer would be E as the opposite. Or maybe the question is about how they do view it, and she's suggesting it's not Kantian. So the answer would be E is incorrect, meaning the correct option is something else.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to clarify. Nussbaum's critique is that a Kantian approach is too abstract and doesn't capture the complexity of cross-cultural interactions. She argues for a more emotion-based and capability-focused approach. So when the question asks how people tend to view their interactions, Nussbaum would say not in a Kantian way. Therefore, the correct answer is E: in a Kantian way, because the question is asking what they tend to do, and Nussbaum is pointing out that they don't do that.

Wait, no. The question is about what Nussbaum claims they tend to view it as. If she's against Kantian, then the answer would be that they don't view it that way. But the options are the ways they do view it. So maybe I'm overcomplicating. The answer is E because the question is about how they tend to view it, and Nussbaum's point is that they don't see it in a Kantian way, so the answer is E as the option that they don't use, but the question is about what they do use. Maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is H: in a relativist way. Because relativism is about different cultures having their own truths, but I'm not sure if that's what Nussbaum says. Or maybe she's more about emotion and capability, which isn't directly tied to any of the options except perhaps E.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think again. The question is about the inhabitants' view. Nussbaum's critique is that a Kantian approach is not suitable because it's too rational and doesn't account for emotions and the diversity of experiences. So she's saying that people from different conceptual schemes don't view their interactions in a Kantian way. Therefore, the correct answer would be that they don't view it in a Kantian way, so the answer is E: in a Kantian way, because that's what they don't do. But wait, the question is asking how they do view it, so the answer is not E. Maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I'm misremembering. Maybe Nussbaum argues that people do use a Kantian approach, but that's not the right way. Or maybe the opposite. I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, maybe the answer is E because the question is asking what they tend to do, and Nussbaum is saying they don't, so the correct answer is E, but I'm not entirely sure.

I think I'll go with E: in a Kantian way, because the question is about how they view it, and Nussbaum's point is that they don't, so the answer is E.

The question asks how Nussbaum claims inhabitants of different conceptual schemes tend to view their interactions in cross-cultural communication. Nussbaum critiques the Kantian approach for being too rational and not accounting for emotional and intersubjective aspects. She argues that a Kantian framework is insufficient for understanding cross-cultural interactions. Therefore, the correct answer is that they do not view their interactions in a Kantian way.
