Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the z-transform of a discrete-time signal f[n]. The function f[n] is given as the sum of three delta functions: 3δ[n+2] + 4δ[n-1] + 2δ[n-3]. The z-transform formula is F(z) = sum from n=-infty to infty of f[n] z^{-n}.

Hmm, I remember that the z-transform of the delta function δ[n - k] is z^{-k}. So each delta term will contribute a term in the z-transform. Let me break it down step by step.

First, let's consider each term separately. 

1. The first term is 3δ[n+2]. Let me think: δ[n+2] is the same as δ[n - (-2)], so k is -2 here. Wait, no, because the general form is δ[n - k], so for δ[n+2], that's like k = -2. So the z-transform would be z^{-(-2)} = z^{2}, but wait, no, wait. Wait, the definition is sum f[n] z^{-n}, so for δ[n + 2], which is 1 when n = -2, then the term becomes 3 * z^{-(-2)} = 3 z^{2}.

2. The second term is 4δ[n-1]. Here, k is 1. So the transform is 4 z^{-1} because it's 4 times z^{-1}.

3. The third term is 2δ[n-3]. So k is 3, so the transform is 2 z^{-3}.

Now I need to add all these terms together. So F(z) should be 3z² + 4z^{-1} + 2z^{-3}.

Wait, let me make sure I'm not mixing up the exponents. Each term's exponent is -n, where n is the argument of the delta function. So for δ[n+2], n = -2, so the term is z^{-(-2)} = z^2. Yes, that's correct.

So looking at the options, which one matches 3z² +4z^{-1} + 2z^{-3}?

Option B is 3z² +4z^{-1} + 2z^{-3}. That's exactly what I got. So the answer should be B.

Wait, let me check the options again to make sure I didn't misread any. Option B is indeed 3z² +4z^{-1} + 2z^{-3}. Yep, that's correct.

The z-transform of each delta function is determined by substituting the appropriate value into the z^{-n} term. For 3δ[n+2], the transform is 3z². For 4δ[n-1], it's 4z^{-1}. For 2δ[n-3], it's 2z^{-3}. Adding these gives F(z) = 3z² + 4z^{-1} + 2z^{-3}, which matches option B.

Answer: B
