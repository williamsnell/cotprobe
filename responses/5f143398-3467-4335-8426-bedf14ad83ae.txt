Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about Hare's assertion on how ethics and science are similar. I'm a bit new to this, so I need to break it down step by step. Let me think through each option one by one.

First, the question is asking what Hare claims is similar between ethics and science. I remember from my studies that Hare was a philosopher, so his views are likely from a philosophical perspective. I think he might have written about the relationship between ethics and science, maybe in the context of moral philosophy.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Both are infallible and beyond questioning. Hmm, I don't think that's right. Science is all about questioning and falsifying theories. Ethics might have principles that are questioned as well. So A seems incorrect.

Option B: Ethics guides science in its pursuit of knowledge. I'm not sure about this. I know that sometimes ethics does influence scientific research, like in deciding what experiments are permissible. But does ethics guide science's pursuit of knowledge in a structural way? Maybe, but I'm not certain if this is what Hare says.

Option C: Both are essential components of a worthwhile life. That sounds more like a general statement. I'm not sure if Hare specifically compared their roles in life as similar. It might be true, but I'm not sure if that's the main point he's making about their similarity.

Option D: Both are completely separate and do not intersect. That doesn't seem right. Science and ethics definitely intersect, especially in areas like bioethics. So D is probably incorrect.

Option E: Both seek to provide us with true beliefs about the world. Well, science definitely does that. Ethics, on the other hand, deals more with principles of right and wrong, so maybe not "true beliefs" in the same empirical sense. So E might not be right.

Option F: Both involve testing general principles by examining their logical consequences. This rings a bell. I think Hare talked about ethical theories being tested by their consequences. Similarly, scientific theories are tested by their logical implications and predictions. So F could be the correct answer.

Option G: All of the above. Well, if F is correct, then G would only be correct if all the other options are also correct, which I don't think they are. So G is probably wrong.

Option H: Both are based solely on personal opinions and beliefs. No, both ethics and science are more objective than that. Science relies on evidence, and ethics often seeks to be universal, so H is incorrect.

So, putting it together, the best fit is Option F. Both ethics and science test their principles by looking at logical consequences. That makes sense because Hare's ethical system, like utilitarianism, involves testing the outcomes of actions to determine their moral worth, much like how scientific theories are tested against observations and logical deductions.

I think I'm confident enough with this reasoning. So the answer should be F.

The correct answer is F.

F: both involve testing general principles by examining their logical consequences.

**Answer:** F
