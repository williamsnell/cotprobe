Okay, so I have this biology question here, and I need to figure out the right answer. The question is about which animals maintain a constant body temperature despite changes in their environment. The options are frog, robin, fish, dog, or lizard. Then there are multiple choices from A to J, each pairing two animals.

Hmm, I remember that animals are either endothermic or ectothermic. Endothermic animals can regulate their body temperature internally, so they stay warm even when it's cold outside. Ectothermic animals rely on external heat sources; their body temperature changes with the environment.

Let me think about each animal:

- Robin: Birds are endothermic. They have feathers and a high metabolic rate, so they can maintain a constant body temperature.
- Frog: Amphibians like frogs are generally ectothermic. They rely on their surroundings to stay warm or cool.
- Fish: Fish live in water, and most are ectothermic. Their body temperature usually matches the water temperature.
- Dog: Dogs are mammals, and mammals are endothermic. They can generate their own body heat and maintain a stable temperature.
- Lizard: Reptiles, including lizards, are ectothermic. They bask in the sun to warm up and move to shade when it's too hot.

So the question is asking which ones maintain a constant body temperature. That means I'm looking for endothermic animals.

Looking at the options:

- Robin is endothermic, so it's a yes.
- Frog is ectothermic, so no.
- Fish is ectothermic, so no.
- Dog is endothermic, yes.
- Lizard is ectothermic, so no.

Wait, but let me double-check. Are all birds endothermic? Yes, they have the same system as mammals for regulating body temperature. What about fish? Some species might have some temperature regulation, but most are ectothermic. So fish don't maintain a constant body temp.

So the correct animals are robin and dog. Now I need to look at the options. Let's see the choices:

A: Robin, Lizard → Lizard is ectothermic, so not both correct.
B: Frog, Fish → Both ectothermic, wrong.
C: Lizard, Frog → Both ectothermic, no.
D: Fish, Dog → Fish is ectothermic, Dog is endothermic. So only Dog is correct, but the option says Fish and Dog. So this isn't the right pair.
E: Fish, Lizard → Both ectothermic, wrong.
F: Dog, Frog → Dog is endothermic, Frog is ectothermic. So only Dog is correct, but the option includes Frog, which is wrong.
G: Lizard, Fish → Both ectothermic, no.
H: Frog, Robin → Frog is ectothermic, Robin is endothermic. So only Robin is correct, but the option includes Frog, which is wrong.
I: Dog, Lizard → Dog is endothermic, Lizard is ectothermic. So only Dog is correct, but the option includes Lizard, which is wrong.
J: Robin, Dog → Both are endothermic. Robin is a bird, Dog is a mammal. So both maintain constant body temp.

Wait a minute, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me check again. The initial analysis was correct, but when I looked at the options, I think I missed J.

So, the correct pair is Robin and Dog. Looking at the options, option J is Robin and Dog.

Wait, earlier I thought J was correct because both are endothermic. Yes, that's right. So the correct answer should be J.

The question asks which animals maintain a constant body temperature despite environmental changes. Endothermic animals regulate their body temperature internally, while ectothermic animals rely on external sources. 

Analyzing the options:
- Robin (bird) and Dog (mammal) are endothermic, maintaining a constant body temperature.
- Frog, Fish, and Lizard are ectothermic, with body temperatures influenced by the environment.

Among the given choices, only option J pairs Robin and Dog, both of which are endothermic and maintain a constant body temperature.

Answer: J
