Okay, so I've got this logic problem to solve. It's about constructing a truth table for a given argument and then determining if it's valid or invalid. If it's invalid, I need to pick the correct counterexample from the options provided. Let me break this down step by step.

First, let's understand the argument. The premises are:

1. Q is equivalent to R. So, Q ≡ R. That means whenever Q is true, R is also true, and vice versa. If Q is false, R is false, and if R is false, Q is false. So, they're logically equivalent; their truth values are the same in every possible scenario.

2. The second premise is ~(S ∨ Q), which is the negation of (S ∨ Q). So, whenever either S or Q is true, this entire premise is false. It's only true when both S and Q are false because that's when (S ∨ Q) is false, and its negation becomes true.

The conclusion of the argument is R. So, the argument is saying that if we have these two premises, then R must follow.

Now, the task is to construct a truth table for this argument. Let's list all possible truth values for the atomic propositions Q, R, and S. Since there are three atomic propositions, there are 2^3 = 8 possible combinations.

I'll create columns for Q, R, S, premise 1 (Q ≡ R), premise 2 (~ (S ∨ Q)), and the conclusion R. Then, I'll compute the truth values for each part.

Let me list the possible combinations:

1. Q: T, R: T, S: T
2. Q: T, R: T, S: F
3. Q: T, R: F, S: T
4. Q: T, R: F, S: F
5. Q: F, R: T, S: T
6. Q: F, R: T, S: F
7. Q: F, R: F, S: T
8. Q: F, R: F, S: F

Wait, but wait a minute. Since Q ≡ R, their truth values must match. So, in cases where Q and R don't match, the first premise is false. So, I can actually reduce the number of cases because Q and R must be the same. Let me correct that.

So, the possible cases are:

1. Q=T, R=T, S=T
2. Q=T, R=T, S=F
3. Q=F, R=F, S=T
4. Q=F, R=F, S=F

Wait, no. Because if Q is T, R must be T, and if Q is F, R must be F. So, the four possible cases are determined by Q and S, since R is dependent on Q.

So, let me structure it properly. Let's have Q and S as variables, and R is determined by Q.

So, the possible combinations are:

1. Q=T, S=T → R=T
2. Q=T, S=F → R=T
3. Q=F, S=T → R=F
4. Q=F, S=F → R=F

Now, for each of these four cases, I'll compute the truth values.

Let's make a table:

Case | Q | R (since Q≡R) | S | Premise 1 (Q≡R) | Premise 2 (~ (S∨Q)) | Conclusion R
-----|---|---|---|----------------|------------------------|----------
1    | T | T | T | T              | ~(T∨T) = F            | T
2    | T | T | F | T              | ~(F∨T) = F            | T
3    | F | F | T | T              | ~(T∨F) = F            | F
4    | F | F | F | T              | ~(F∨F) = T            | F

Wait, no. Wait, in case 3 and 4, R is F because Q is F.

Now, let's compute each premise and conclusion.

Case 1:
Q=T, R=T, S=T
Premise 1: T≡T → T
Premise 2: ~(T∨T) → ~T → F
Conclusion R=T

Case 2:
Q=T, R=T, S=F
Premise 1: T
Premise 2: ~(F∨T) → ~T → F
Conclusion R=T

Case 3:
Q=F, R=F, S=T
Premise 1: F≡F → T
Premise 2: ~(T∨F) → ~T → F
Conclusion R=F

Case 4:
Q=F, R=F, S=F
Premise 1: T
Premise 2: ~(F∨F) → ~F → T
Conclusion R=F

Now, the argument is: if Premise 1 and Premise 2 are both true, then Conclusion R must be true. So, we look for cases where both premises are true and check if the conclusion is also true.

Looking at the cases:

In Case 1:
Premise 1=T, Premise 2=F → So, the premises are not both true. So, no issue here.

Case 2:
Premise 1=T, Premise 2=F → Again, premises not both true.

Case 3:
Premise 1=T, Premise 2=F → Same as above.

Case 4:
Premise 1=T, Premise 2=T → Now, both premises are true. What's the conclusion? R=F.

So, in this case, the premises are true, but the conclusion is false. That means the argument is invalid because there's a counterexample where the premises are true, but the conclusion is false.

So, the counterexample is when Q=F, S=F, and R=F. Because in this case, Q≡R is T, ~(S∨Q) is T (since S=F and Q=F, S∨Q=F, so negation is T), and R=F.

Looking at the options, option F says: Invalid. Counterexample when S is true and Q and R are false. Wait, no. Let me check each option.

Option A: Invalid. Counterexample when Q, S, and R are false. So Q=F, S=F, R=F. Yes, that's the case we have.

Wait, but let me check all options:

A: Q, S, R all F → Yes, that's case 4.

B: Q=F, S=T, R=T. So, in that case, Q=F, R=T → Q≡R would be F, so premise 1 is F. So, premises wouldn't both be true, so not a counterexample.

C: Q=T, S=F, R=T → Premise 1=T, premise 2= ~ (F∨T)= ~T = F. So, premises not both true.

D: Valid. No counterexample. But we found a counterexample, so D is incorrect.

E: Q=T, S=T, R=F → Q≡R=F, so premise 1=F. Not a counterexample.

F: S=T, Q=F, R=F → Q=F, R=F → premise 1=T. Premise 2= ~(T∨F)= ~T=F. So, premises not both true. So, not a counterexample.

G: R=T, Q=F, S=F → Q=F, R=T → premise 1=F. So, premises not both true.

H: Q=T, R=T, S=F → premise 2= ~(F∨T)= F. So, premises not both true.

I: Valid. No, we have a counterexample.

J: Q=T, S=F, R=F → Q=T, R=F. So, Q≡R=F. Premise 1=F. So, premises not both true.

So, the correct counterexample is when Q=F, S=F, R=F, which is option A.

Wait, but let me double-check. In case 4, Q=F, S=F, R=F. Premise 1 is T because Q≡R (both F). Premise 2 is ~(F∨F)=T. So, both premises are T, but conclusion R is F. So yes, that's a counterexample.

So, the answer should be option A: Invalid. Counterexample when Q, S, and R are false.
</think>

The argument is invalid because there exists a counterexample where Q, S, and R are all false. In this case, both premises are true, but the conclusion is false.
