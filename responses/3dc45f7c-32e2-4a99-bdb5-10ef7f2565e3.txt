Okay, so I have this question about genetics, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is asking how to determine whether a given population is in genetic equilibrium. The options are A through J.

First, I remember that genetic equilibrium refers to a population where the allele and genotype frequencies don't change from one generation to the next. This is also known as Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The conditions for this are that there's no mutation, random mating, no migration (gene flow), no natural selection, and a very large population size with no genetic drift.

So, the question is about determining if a population meets these conditions. The options give different methods to check. Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: Measure the physical characteristics. Hmm, that might tell you about the traits present, but not necessarily about equilibrium. Because equilibrium is more about whether the frequencies are stable, not just what traits are there.

Option B: Compare to a different species. That doesn't make sense. We're comparing within the same species, not across species.

Option C: Compare disease resistance. Disease resistance is related to natural selection. If a population is resistant, maybe they're under selection, which would disrupt equilibrium. But is that the main way to check? Not directly, I think.

Option D: Check for natural selection. Well, if natural selection is occurring, that would mean the population isn't in equilibrium. So checking for its presence would help, but is that the direct method? Or is it more about looking at allele frequencies over time?

Option E: Compare gene and genotype frequencies over two generations. Oh, wait, that sounds right. If you look at the frequencies in two generations, you can see if they're changing. If they're the same, the population might be in equilibrium. This seems like the textbook method, using the Hardy-Weinberg principle.

Option F: Analyze fossil records. That's about past populations, not current ones. Probably not relevant here.

Option G: Observe mating behaviors. Mating affects genetic equilibrium. For example, random mating is a condition. But just observing behaviors for one generation might not capture all factors. Plus, behaviors don't directly show allele frequencies.

Option H: Look at age distribution and life expectancy. That's more about demography and population viability, not genetic makeup. Doesn't directly relate to genetic equilibrium.

Option I: Monitor climate and environment. Changes in environment could affect migration or selection, but again, this is about external factors, not the genetic frequencies themselves.

Option J: Study migration patterns. Migration (gene flow) is one of the factors that disrupts equilibrium. So checking migration could indicate if the population is not in equilibrium, but it's just one factor. The question is about determining equilibrium, which requires checking all factors.

So, the key is to see whether the allele and genotype frequencies are changing. The Hardy-Weinberg principle states that if these frequencies don't change over generations, the population is in equilibrium. Therefore, comparing them over two generations (option E) would be the method. Other options might check individual factors, but E directly addresses the condition of equilibrium by looking at frequency changes.

To determine whether a population is in genetic equilibrium, it's essential to assess whether allele and genotype frequencies remain stable across generations. The Hardy-Weinberg principle outlines the conditions for equilibrium, such as no mutation, random mating, no migration, no natural selection, and a large population size. Among the options provided, comparing gene and genotype frequencies over two generations (Option E) directly addresses this requirement, as it measures the stability of genetic frequencies. Other options may touch on factors influencing equilibrium but do not directly assess the necessary condition of unchanged frequencies.

Answer: E
