Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here. Let's read it carefully. The question is about finding the volume occupied by one molecule of glucose-1-phosphate. They've given some data: the molecular weight is 260 g/mol, and the density is 1.5 g/cm³. The options are A through J, each with different volumes in cm³.

Hmm, I remember that density is mass over volume, so density = mass/volume. But wait, how do I find the volume of a single molecule? Oh right, maybe I can find the volume per mole first and then divide by Avogadro's number to get the volume per molecule.

So first, let's think about molar volume. Molar volume is the volume that one mole of a substance occupies. Since density is mass per volume, rearranging that formula gives volume = mass/density. But wait, for one mole, the mass would be the molecular weight in grams. So the molar mass is 260 g/mol, right?

So the volume for one mole would be mass divided by density. The mass of one mole is 260 grams. Density is 1.5 g/cm³. So volume = 260 g / 1.5 g/cm³. Let me calculate that. 260 divided by 1.5 is... Hmm, 260 ÷ 1.5 equals 173.333... cm³ per mole. So approximately 173.33 cm³/mol.

But wait, I need the volume per molecule, not per mole. So I should use Avogadro's number, which is approximately 6.022×10²³ molecules/mol. So, the volume per molecule would be the molar volume divided by Avogadro's number.

So, 173.33 cm³/mol divided by 6.022×10²³ molecules/mol. Let me compute that. 173.33 / 6.022e23. Let's approximate the numbers. 173.33 is about 1.7333e2, so 1.7333e2 / 6.022e23 = (1.7333 / 6.022) × 10^(2-23) = approximately 0.2877 × 10^-21 cm³. Which is roughly 2.877 × 10^-22 cm³.

Looking at the options, option A is 2.9 ×10^-22 cm³, which is very close to my calculation. But wait, let me double-check my steps. Did I make any mistakes?

The molecular weight is 260 g/mol. Density is 1.5 g/cm³. So molar volume is 260 / 1.5 = 173.33 cm³/mol. Then divide by Avogadro's number: 173.33 / (6.022e23) = approx 2.877e-22 cm³/molecule. Yes, that matches option A.

Wait, but let me think again. Am I certain about the approach? Another way is to compute the volume of one molecule directly. Alternatively, maybe I should consider the molar mass and density to find the molar volume, which is what I did. So I think the approach is correct.

I wonder if I messed up the exponents. Let me recalculate the division:

173.333 / 6.022e23 = ?

Let me compute 173.333 ÷ 6.022 = approx 28.77, because 6.022 × 28 = 168.616, and 6.022 ×28.77 ≈ 173.333. So 28.77 × 10^(-23+0) → Wait, no. Because 6.022e23 is 6.022 × 10^23. So 173.333 / 6.022e23 = (173.333 / 6.022) × 10^(-23). 173.333 ÷6.022 is approximately 28.77, so 28.77 ×1e-23 = 2.877e-22 cm³. That's exactly what I got before. So yes, option A is correct.

To determine the volume occupied by one molecule of glucose-1-phosphate, we start by calculating the molar volume. The molecular weight is 260 g/mol, and the density is 1.5 g/cm³. Using the formula for density, \( \text{volume} = \frac{\text{mass}}{\text{density}} \), the molar volume is:

\[
\text{Molar volume} = \frac{260 \, \text{g}}{1.5 \, \text{g/cm}^3} = 173.33 \, \text{cm}^3/\text{mol}.
\]

Next, to find the volume per molecule, we divide the molar volume by Avogadro's number (\(6.022 \times 10^{23} \, \text{molecules/mol}\)):

\[
\text{Volume per molecule} = \frac{173.33 \, \text{cm}^3/\text{mol}}{6.022 \times 10^{23} \, \text{molecules/mol}} \approx 2.877 \times 10^{-22} \, \text{cm}^3/\text{molecule}.
\]

This value closely matches option A, which is \(2.9 \times 10^{-22} \, \text{cm}^3\). Therefore, the correct answer is:

A: \(2.9 \times 10^{-22} \, \text{cm}^3\).
