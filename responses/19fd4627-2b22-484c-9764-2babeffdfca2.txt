<think>
Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let's read through it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about the barometric formula, which relates the pressure of a gas at a certain altitude to its pressure at sea level. I remember that this has something to do with how pressure decreases with height in the atmosphere. The problem asks me to derive the relationship by showing that the change in pressure, dp, for a tiny change in altitude dh is dp = -ρg dh. Oh right, ρ is the density of the air, and g is the acceleration due to gravity. Then, I'm supposed to evaluate the pressure difference between the top and bottom of a laboratory vessel that's 15 cm tall.

Wait, so the vessel is 15 cm tall. But I'm not sure if I need to consider the actual atmospheric conditions or if I'm supposed to use the barometric formula to find this small pressure difference.

First, let's tackle the derivation part. The barometric formula relates pressure p at height h to p0 at sea level. The change in pressure dp when you go up by dh is given by dp = -ρg dh. I remember that this comes from considering a thin layer of air. The force exerted by the atmosphere on the top and bottom of this layer must balance the weight of the air. So, the pressure difference times the area of the layer equals the weight of the air in the layer. Mathematically, that should give pA - (p + dp)A = - (mass of layer)g. Simplifying, dp = -ρg dh since density ρ = mass/volume and volume is A dh.

So I think that's the starting point for the barometric formula. But wait, the barometric formula usually ends up being p = p0 exp(-Mgh/(R T)), where M is molar mass, R is gas constant, and T is temperature. But maybe for this problem, I don't need to go that far. The problem might just want me to compute the pressure difference over a small height, 15 cm, assuming the density is roughly constant over that small distance.

Wait, but the problem says to use the relation dp = -ρg dh. So perhaps we can approximate the change in pressure as dp ≈ -ρg h, where h is 0.15 meters.

But wait, ρ depends on pressure, so if the pressure changes, the density changes. But for a small height like 15 cm, maybe we can approximate ρ as roughly constant. Alternatively, maybe we can use the average density over that height.

Alternatively, perhaps we can model this using the hydrostatic equation, which is basically the same as the barometric formula's derivation.

Wait, but let's think about the actual approach. The problem says to evaluate the pressure difference between the top and bottom of a vessel of height 15 cm. So, we're talking about a container filled with air, and we need to find the pressure difference across its height due to the air's weight.

In other words, the pressure at the bottom is higher than at the top by an amount equal to the weight of the air column above it.

So, the pressure difference Δp = ρ g h.

But wait, in the expression from the barometric formula, it's dp = -ρg dh, so over a height h, the change would be Δp = -∫(from 0 to h) ρg dh. But if we're considering the pressure at the bottom being higher than the top, then the pressure difference is positive, so Δp = p_bottom - p_top = ρ g h.

But wait, if the vessel is 15 cm tall, h is 0.15 m. Now, I need to find ρ. But what's ρ here? Is it the density of air at sea level, or at some other condition?

Wait, but the problem doesn't specify any particular conditions, so perhaps we are to assume that the density is that of air under standard atmospheric conditions. Or maybe we can express it in terms of the given variables.

Wait, the problem mentions that the gas has molar mass M. Hmm, but the question says to evaluate the pressure difference, so maybe we need to express it in terms of M.

Wait, maybe I should go back to the barometric formula. The barometric formula is derived from the hydrostatic equation:

dp/dh = -ρ g

But we also know from the ideal gas law that p = ρ R T, where R is the gas constant and T is the temperature. So, substituting ρ = p/(R T) into the hydrostatic equation gives:

dp/dh = - (p/(R T)) g

Which can be rewritten as:

dp/p = - (g/(R T)) dh

Integrating both sides from h=0 to h, and p=p0 to p=p(h), we get:

ln(p/p0) = - (g M)/(R T) h

Wait, wait, no. Wait, wait, actually, from the ideal gas law, p = (ρ R T), and since ρ = m/V, and m = nM = (p V)/(P) * M, but maybe that's complicating it.

Wait, perhaps another approach. The equation becomes dp/dh = - (p M g)/(R T), because ρ = p M/(R T), since ρ = (mass)/(volume) and mass = nM = (p V)/(RT) * M, so ρ = (p M)/(R T). So substituting into dp/dh = -ρ g:

dp/dh = - (p M g)/(R T)

This is a differential equation that can be solved as:

dp/p = - (M g)/(R T) dh

Integrate from h=0 (p=p0) to h (p):

ln(p/p0) = - (M g h)/(R T)

Then, exponentiating,

p = p0 exp( - M g h/(R T) )

But that's the barometric formula. But perhaps for a small height, we can approximate this exponential using a Taylor expansion. Since h is small, M g h/(R T) is small, so exp(x) ≈ 1 + x. So,

p ≈ p0 [1 - M g h/(R T) ]

Thus, the pressure difference Δp = p0 - p ≈ p0 * (M g h)/(R T)

Wait, because p at top is lower than p0 at bottom, so p0 - p = Δp = p0 (M g h)/(R T)

But then, if I'm to compute this, I need values for M, R, T, and h.

Wait, but the problem doesn't give me specific values except for h=15 cm=0.15 m. So perhaps we're supposed to use the standard sea-level conditions, where p0 is about 101325 Pascals, M is the molar mass of air, which is approximately 28.97 g/mol or 0.02897 kg/mol. R is the universal gas constant, 8.314 J/(mol·K), and T is the temperature, perhaps taken as 293 K, which is about 20°C.

Alternatively, perhaps another approach is needed. Wait, in the problem statement, it's implied that the vessel's height is 15 cm, and we're to find the pressure difference between top and bottom. So, perhaps we can model this using the same approach as barometric pressure, but over a small height, so Δp ≈ ρ g h.

But then we need to find ρ. Alternatively, perhaps using the ideal gas law, since ρ = p M/(R T), and if the pressure doesn't change much, we can take p as p0, the sea-level pressure.

So, let's compute that.

Given h=0.15 m, g=9.81 m/s², M=0.02897 kg/mol, R=8.314 J/(mol·K), T=293 K.

So, ρ = p0 M/(R T). Let's compute ρ first.

p0 is standard atmospheric pressure, 101325 Pa.

So, ρ = (101325 Pa) * (0.02897 kg/mol) / (8.314 J/(mol·K) * 293 K)

Compute denominator first: 8.314 * 293 ≈ 2438.622 J/mol.

So,

ρ ≈ (101325 * 0.02897) / 2438.622

Compute numerator: 101325 * 0.02897 ≈ let's see:

101325 * 0.02897 = ?

Well, 100,000 * 0.02897 = 2897, and 1325 * 0.02897 ≈ approximately 38.33, so total around 2897 + 38.33 ≈ 2935.33 kg·Pa/mol.

Wait, but wait, Pa is kg/(m·s²), so when multiplied by kg/mol, the units would be (kg/(m·s²)) * kg/mol → kg²/(m·s²·mol). Hmm, perhaps I'm complicating it; maybe I should just compute the numerical value.

Wait, 101325 ≈ 1.01325e5, and 0.02897 is about 2.897e-2.

Multiply them: 1.01325e5 * 2.897e-2 = 1.01325 * 2.897 * 1e3.

1.01325 * 2.897 ≈ let's compute:

1 * 2.897 = 2.897
0.01325 * 2.897 ≈ ~0.0383
Total ≈ 2.9353.

So, 2.9353e3 kg/(m·s²·mol) ?

Wait, no, because 101325 Pa is kg/(m·s²), so multiplying by M in kg/mol gives (kg/(m·s²)) * (kg/mol) → kg²/(m·s²·mol), which doesn't seem right for density.

Hmm, perhaps I'm making a mistake in units. Let me double-check.

Wait, the correct formula is ρ = (p M)/(R T). So units:

p is in Pa = kg/(m·s²)
M is kg/mol
R is J/(mol·K) = (kg·m²)/(s²·mol·K)
T is K.

So,

ρ = (kg/(m·s²)) * (kg/mol) / [ (kg·m²)/(s²·mol·K) * K ) ]

Simplify denominator: (kg·m²)/(s²·mol·K) * K = kg·m²/(s²·mol)

So,

ρ = [ kg/(m·s²) * kg/mol ] / [ kg·m²/(s²·mol) ) ]

= [ kg²/(m·s²·mol) ] / [ kg·m²/(s²·mol) ) ]

= (kg²/(m·s²·mol)) * (s²·mol)/(kg·m²)) )

= (kg² * s²·mol) ) / (m·s²·mol * kg·m²))

Simplify:

kg² / kg = kg
s² cancels
mol cancels
m in denominator and m² in numerator gives 1/m.

So, overall, kg/(m), which is correct for density (kg/m³).

So, back to the numbers:

ρ ≈ (101325 * 0.02897) / (8.314 * 293)

Compute numerator: 101325 * 0.02897 ≈ let me compute this accurately.

Compute 100,000 * 0.02897 = 2897
Compute 1325 * 0.02897:

1325 * 0.02897 = let's compute 1325 * 0.028 = 37.095, and 1325 * 0.00097= approx 1.287. So total ≈37.095 +1.287=38.382.

So total numerator is 2897 +38.382=2935.382.

Denominator:8.314 *293≈ 8.314 * 300=2494.2, but 293 is 7 less than 300, so 8.314 *7=58.198. So 2494.2 -58.198≈2436.002.

So,

ρ ≈ 2935.382 / 2436.002 ≈ approximately 1.205 kg/m³.

Wait, that seems high. Wait, the density of air at sea level is about 1.225 kg/m³, so 1.205 is close enough, perhaps due to rounding.

So, ρ ≈1.205 kg/m³.

Now, using the formula Δp = ρ g h.

h=0.15 m.

So,

Δp = 1.205 kg/m³ * 9.81 m/s² * 0.15 m.

Compute step by step:

1.205 *9.81 ≈ let's compute 1.2 *9.81=11.772, and 0.005 *9.81≈0.04905. So total ≈11.772 +0.049=11.821.

Multiply by 0.15:

11.821 *0.15 = approx 1.77315 Pascals.

Wait, that's about 1.773e-5 kPa? No, wait, 1 Pascal is 1 N/m², and the options are in terms of 1e-5.

Wait, the options are numbers without units, but looking at the options, they are in the order of 1e-5. Wait, 1.773 Pascals is 1.773e-3 kPa, but none of the options are that large. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, no, wait, the options are in the order of 1e-5 Pascals? Or possibly they're in units of Pascals, but the numbers are small.

Wait, but 1.773 Pascals is 1.773e-3 kPa, which is 1.773e-6 MPa. But looking at the options, the numbers are around 1e-5, which is 0.001 Pa. Wait, no, 1e-5 Pascals is 0.00001 Pa, which is very small. But my calculation gave me about 1.77 Pa, which is way larger than the options.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in units somewhere. Let me check again.

Wait, the pressure difference is Δp = ρ g h.

With ρ=1.205 kg/m³, g=9.81 m/s², h=0.15 m.

So,

1.205 *9.81 = approximately 11.82255.

Multiply by 0.15:

11.82255 *0.15 = 1.77338 Pa.

So, around 1.773 Pa.

But looking at the options, the numbers are in the range of 1e-5, which is 0.00001, which is much smaller. So something's wrong here.

Wait, perhaps I've made a mistake in the way I'm calculating Δp. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I should use the approximation from the barometric formula, which for small h is Δp ≈ p0 (M g h)/(R T).

So, let's compute that.

p0 =101325 Pa.

M=0.02897 kg/mol.

g=9.81 m/s².

R=8.314 J/(mol·K).

T=293 K.

So,

Δp ≈ p0 * (M g h)/(R T).

Compute numerator: M g h =0.02897 *9.81 *0.15.

Compute 0.02897 *9.81 ≈ 0.284 kg·m/s² per m.

Then, 0.284 *0.15 ≈0.0426 kg·m²/s² per m², which is Pascals.

So,

Δp ≈101325 * (0.0426) / (8.314 *293).

Wait, wait, no. Wait, the formula is (M g h)/(R T) as a fraction of p0. So,

(M g h)/(R T) = (0.02897 *9.81 *0.15)/(8.314 *293).

Compute numerator: 0.02897 *9.81≈0.284, then *0.15=0.0426.

Denominator:8.314 *293 ≈2436.

So,

(M g h)/(R T) ≈0.0426 /2436 ≈1.749e-5.

Then, Δp ≈p0 *1.749e-5 ≈101325 * 1.749e-5.

Compute that: 101325 *1.749e-5 ≈approx 1.773 Pa.

Wait, same as before. So I'm getting the same result, which is about 1.773 Pascals. But the options are all in the order of 1e-5, which is 0.00001. So I must have a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of (M g h)/(R T). Let me compute it more accurately.

Compute M g h =0.02897 kg/mol *9.81 m/s² *0.15 m.

0.02897 *9.81 = let's compute:

0.02897 * 9 = 0.26073
0.02897 *0.81=0.0235197
Total ≈0.26073 +0.0235197=0.2842497 N/(m²·mol) ?

Wait, not sure about units, but just the numerical value: 0.28425.

Multiply by 0.15 m: 0.28425 *0.15=0.0426375.

Denominator R T=8.314 *293=8.314*293.

Compute 8*293=2344, 0.314*293≈92.062. So total≈2344+92.062=2436.062.

So,

(M g h)/(R T)=0.0426375 /2436.062 ≈0.00001749 ≈1.749e-5.

So,

Δp ≈p0 *1.749e-5 ≈101325 *1.749e-5.

Compute 101325 *1.749e-5.

First, 1e5 *1.749e-5=1.749.

But 101325 is 1.01325e5, so,

1.01325e5 *1.749e-5 =1.01325 *1.749 ≈approx 1.773.

So, Δp≈1.773 Pascals.

But the options are in 1e-5, so perhaps I'm missing a factor of 1000 somewhere. Wait, maybe the question is asking for the pressure difference in units of Pascals, but the options are written without specifying, so perhaps I should express 1.773 Pa as 1.773e-3 kPa, but the options don't match.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the pressure difference in terms of the height in meters, but no, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach and should consider the pressure change using the exponential formula, but for a small h, the approximation is Δp ≈ (p0 M g h)/(R T).

Wait, but that gives me 1.773 Pa, which isn't matching any of the options. Let me look at the options again.

Options:

A: 1.8e-5

B:1.7e-5

C:2.0e-5

D:1.0e-5

E:1.5e-5

F:1.2e-5

G:2.5e-5

H:1.9e-5

I:1.3e-5

J:2.2e-5

Wait, all the options are around 1e-5, which is 0.00001, so much smaller than 1.773 Pa. So I must have made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps I should not use p0 as 101325 Pa, but perhaps the problem is considering a different scenario, like hydrostatic pressure in a container with air of certain density.

Wait, but the problem says the vessel has a height of 15 cm. So perhaps it's a container filled with air, and the pressure difference is due to the air's weight. So, the pressure difference would be ρ g h, where ρ is the density of air in the container.

But if the container is at the same temperature and pressure as the surrounding air, then the density inside is the same as the surrounding density. So, perhaps using ρ=1.225 kg/m³.

Wait, but earlier I calculated 1.205 kg/m³, which is close enough.

So, ρ=1.225 kg/m³.

g=9.81 m/s².

h=0.15 m.

So,

Δp=1.225 *9.81 *0.15.

Compute:

1.225 *9.81 ≈12.00225.

Multiply by 0.15: 12.00225 *0.15 ≈1.8003375 Pa.

So, Δp≈1.8003 Pa.

But again, this is about 1.8e-3 Pa, not 1.8e-5. Hmm.

Wait a second, perhaps the vessel is under vacuum at the top, so the pressure at the bottom is higher by the amount of ρ g h. So, maybe the problem is to calculate the pressure exerted by the air column of height h.

Wait, but the problem states "the pressure difference between the top and bottom of a laboratory vessel of height 15 cm." So, the pressure at the bottom is higher than the top by ρ g h.

But according to my calculations, this is about 1.8 Pa, which is 1.8e-3 Pascals, which is 1800 Pa if I'm missing a factor, but that doesn't align with the options.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the units. Let me check:

1 Pascal = 1 N/m².

But 1.8 Pa is 1.8 N/m². That's correct.

But why are the options so much smaller?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the value of h. The vessel is 15 cm, which is 0.15 meters. But perhaps the problem is considering h as 0.15 meters, but perhaps the calculation should be done using the barometric formula as an approximation.

Wait, but I think I'm getting the correct result, but the options don't match. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the approximation that Δp = p0 * (M g h)/(R T), which, as I calculated earlier, gives 1.773 Pa, which is about 1.77e-3 Pa, but again, the options are in 1e-5 range.

Wait, perhaps the problem is in the units of h. Maybe h is in centimeters, so 15 cm is 0.15 m, which I've used correctly.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different value for g, like 9.8 m/s², but that wouldn't change it enough to get into the 1e-5 range.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express the result in terms of 1e-5 Pascals.

Wait, 1.773 Pa is 17730e-5 Pascals. That's way bigger than the options.

Hmm, I'm confused. Maybe I'm missing a step where I should divide by something else.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not considering the entire atmospheric pressure but only the contribution from the air in the vessel. Wait, but a 15 cm column of air at sea level pressure would have a pressure difference of about 1.8 Pa, as I calculated.

Wait, perhaps the problem is actually about the pressure difference between the top and bottom of the vessel due to the height of the air inside, assuming the vessel is sealed and contains air at a certain pressure. But without more information, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider using the barometric formula in a different way. Let's think again about the formula:

p = p0 exp(-M g h/(R T)).

The pressure at the top (h=0.15 m) is p_top = p0 exp(-M g h/(R T)).

The pressure at the bottom is p_bottom = p0.

So, the pressure difference is Δp = p0 - p_top = p0 (1 - exp(-M g h/(R T))).

For small h, we can approximate exp(-x) ≈ 1 -x + x²/2 - ..., so 1 - exp(-x) ≈x - x²/2.

But for very small x, we can approximate 1 - exp(-x) ≈x.

So,

Δp ≈ p0 * (M g h)/(R T).

Which is the same as before, giving me about 1.773 Pa.

But again, that's not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps I'm supposed to calculate the pressure difference as a fraction of the total pressure, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different value for M, R, or T.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is considering that the vessel is filled with a gas of molar mass M, but without specifying, perhaps it's using the molar mass of air, which is about 29 g/mol.

Wait, but I used M=0.02897 kg/mol, which is correct for air.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the density of air at a certain height, but without specific info, I can't proceed.

Wait, perhaps I should look for an alternative approach. Let's think about the barometric formula again.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the relation dp = -ρ g dh, and wants me to integrate this from h=0 to h=0.15 m, assuming ρ is constant.

So, dp = -ρ g dh → integrating from 0 to h gives:

p(h) = p0 - ρ g h.

So, Δp = p0 - p(h) = ρ g h.

But again, with ρ = p0 M/(R T), so:

Δp = (p0 M g h)/(R T).

Which is the same as before.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the ideal gas law in a different way. Let me think.

Another approach: The number of moles in the vessel's height h is n = (p V)/(R T), where V is the volume. But the vessel's volume is A*h, where A is the cross-sectional area. But since we're considering an infinitesimal change, perhaps this approach isn't helpful.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the pressure difference using the ideal gas law, considering the change in pressure with height.

Wait, but I think I've already tried that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation earlier.

Let me recompute (M g h)/(R T).

M=0.02897 kg/mol,

g=9.81 m/s²,

h=0.15 m,

R=8.314 J/(mol·K),

T=293 K.

Compute numerator: M g h =0.02897 *9.81 *0.15.

0.02897 *9.81 = let's calculate.

0.02897 *9 = 0.26073,

0.02897 *0.81 = 0.0235197,

Total: 0.26073 + 0.0235197 = 0.2842497.

Multiply by 0.15: 0.2842497 *0.15=0.042637455.

Denominator: R T=8.314 *293=8.314 *293= let's compute:

8 *293=2344,

0.314 *293= approx 92.062,

So total=2344+92.062=2436.062.

So,

(M g h)/(R T)=0.042637455 /2436.062 ≈0.00001749 ≈1.749e-5.

So,

Δp= p0 * (M g h)/(R T) =101325 *1.749e-5 ≈1.773 Pa.

But again, the options are on the order of 1e-5, which is way smaller.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the pressure difference in terms of the height in meters times g and so on, but maybe I'm missing a division by 1000 somewhere.

Wait, 1.773 Pa is 1.773e-3 kPa, which is 1.773e-6 MPa, but none of the options are close to that.

Hmm.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps I should express the pressure difference as a fraction of the standard atmosphere, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different value for p0, but I used 101325 Pa, which is standard.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to compute the pressure difference in terms of the height in meters times the average pressure gradient. The average pressure gradient in the atmosphere is about 12 Pa/m, so over 0.15 m, that would be 1.8 Pa, which matches my earlier calculation. But again, the options don't match.

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is 1.7e-5, which is very close to the 1.749e-5 I calculated for (M g h)/(R T) as a fraction of p0. But wait, in that case, the pressure difference Δp would be p0 multiplied by that fraction, which would be 101325 * 1.749e-5 ≈1.773 Pa.

Wait, but 1.773 Pa is 1.773e-3 Pascals, not 1.7e-5. So perhaps I'm missing a factor of 1000 somewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the pressure difference in terms of the height of the vessel but not considering the actual pressure. Wait, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the change in pressure per unit height, but no, the question specifies a 15 cm vessel.

Wait, I'm stuck. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about the pressure difference due to the height of the vessel's walls, considering that the vessel is sealed and the air inside is at a certain pressure. But without knowing the initial pressure, that's unclear.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is using the approximation that the pressure difference Δp = (p0 M g h)/(R T), which gives 1.773 Pa, but the options are in terms of 1e-5 Pascals, so perhaps I should express this as 1.773e-5 kPa, but that still doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach and should instead model the vessel as a column of air of height h, and compute the pressure difference as ρ g h, where ρ is the density of air, which I found to be approximately 1.225 kg/m³.

So,

Δp =1.225 *9.81 *0.15 = approx 1.77 Pa.

But again, the options are way smaller.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different value for g. Let's say g=10 m/s² for simplicity.

Then,

Δp=1.225 *10 *0.15=1.8375 Pa, which is still way larger than the options.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using h in cm, so 15 cm is 0.15 m, which I did.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the pressure difference in kilopascals, but 1.77 Pa is 0.00177 kPa, which is 1.77e-3 kPa, but the options are in 1e-5, which would be 0.00001 kPa. Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps I should check if the formula I'm using is correct. The formula from the barometric equation for small h is Δp ≈ p0 (M g h)/(R T), which I've used correctly.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I've made a mistake in the value of M. Let me double-check. The molar mass of dry air is approximately 28.97 g/mol, which is 0.02897 kg/mol. So that's correct.

Wait, R is 8.314 J/(mol·K), correct.

T is 293 K, correct.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the pressure difference using Δp = (p0 M g h)/(R T) and express the result in Pascals, which gives me about 1.77 Pa, which is 1.77e-3 Pa, but the options are all in 1e-5, which is three orders of magnitude smaller.

Wait, perhaps I'm supposed to compute the pressure difference using the ideal gas law for the air in the vessel, considering it as a column.

Wait, the number of moles in the vessel's height h would be n = (p A h)/(R T), where A is the cross-sectional area. But without knowing A, I can't find n. So perhaps this approach isn't helpful.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is using the relation between pressure and height as p = p0 e^(-h/λ), where λ is the scale height. But the scale height H is given by H = (R T)/Mg, so H = (8.314*293)/(0.02897*9.81). Let me compute H.

H= (8.314 *293)/(0.02897 *9.81).

Compute numerator: 8.314 *293 ≈2437.

Denominator:0.02897 *9.81≈0.284.

So H ≈2437 /0.284 ≈8578 meters. So the scale height is about 8.5 km.

But for h=0.15 m, h/H ≈0.000175, so ln(p/p0) ≈ -h/H ≈-0.000175.

So, p ≈p0 (1 -0.000175) ≈p0 *0.999825.

So, the pressure difference Δp =p0 -p ≈p0 *0.000175.

Compute that:101325 *0.000175=17.731875 Pa.

Again, same result as before. So, I'm consistently getting about 1.77 Pa.

But the options are all in the 1e-5 range, so perhaps I'm missing a factor of 1000 somewhere. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different value for R or M.

Wait, perhaps R is 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K), but that would complicate things since units would change. Let me try that.

If R=0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K), then we'd have to convert units, but this might not be the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using R=8.314 kJ/(mol·K), but that's the same as J/(mol·K), so no difference.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using M in g/mol instead of kg/mol. Let me try that.

M=28.97 g/mol =0.02897 kg/mol, which I've already used correctly.

Wait, perhaps I should compute everything again, but more carefully.

Compute (M g h)/(R T):

M=0.02897 kg/mol,

g=9.81 m/s²,

h=0.15 m,

R=8.314 J/(mol·K),

T=293 K.

M g h =0.02897 *9.81 *0.15.

0.02897 *9.81 =0.284247.

Multiply by 0.15:0.284247 *0.15=0.04263705.

R T=8.314 *293=2436.082.

So, (M g h)/(R T)=0.04263705 /2436.082 ≈0.00001749 ≈1.749e-5.

So, Δp= p0 *1.749e-5 ≈101325 *1.749e-5.

Compute 101325 *1.749e-5:

101325 *1.749e-5 = (101325 /1e5) *1.749 ≈1.01325 *1.749 ≈approx 1.773.

So, 1.773 Pa.

But the options are way smaller.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the pressure difference in terms of the height h in meters, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the pressure difference in terms of the barometric formula's differential equation, but I can't see how that would lead to the options given.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the vessel is a gas container, and the pressure inside is higher due to the height of the gas column. But without knowing the initial pressure, it's unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps I've misread the question and it's asking for the pressure difference in the vessel's walls, but that's not standard.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different approach, such as considering the pressure change due to the vessel's height using the formula p = p0 exp(-h/(H)), where H is the scale height. But for h=0.15 m, which is negligible compared to H=8.5 km, the pressure difference would be minimal, but again, that leads to a small Δp.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the pressure change using the ideal gas law without approximation.

The barometric formula is p = p0 exp(-Mgh/(R T)).

The pressure at the top is p_top = p0 exp(-M g h/(R T)).

So, the difference is Δp = p0 - p_top = p0 (1 - exp(-x)), where x = M g h/(R T).

For small x, as before, 1 - exp(-x) ≈x - x²/2.

But with x=1.749e-5, x² is about 3e-10, which is negligible. So, Δp ≈p0 x.

Which brings us back to Δp≈1.773 Pa.

But again, this doesn't match the options.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of x. Let me compute x again.

x= (M g h)/(R T) = (0.02897 kg/mol *9.81 m/s² *0.15 m)/(8.314 J/(mol·K) *293 K).

Compute numerator:0.02897 *9.81=0.284247; *0.15=0.04263705.

Denominator:8.314 *293=2436.082.

x=0.04263705 /2436.082≈0.00001749=1.749e-5.

So, x=1.749e-5.

So, Δp= p0 *x=101325 *1.749e-5≈1.773 Pa.

Again, same result.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is expecting me to compute the pressure difference in terms of the height of the vessel multiplied by the local gravitational acceleration and the density of air, but without any further data, I can't see another approach.

Wait, perhaps I should check the options again. The closest option to my calculated value of 1.773e-3 Pa is not present, but option B is 1.7e-5, which is 1.7e-5 Pascals, which is about 1000 times smaller than my result.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the numerator or denominator.

Wait, checking the numerator: M=0.02897, g=9.81, h=0.15.

0.02897 *9.81=0.284247.

0.284247 *0.15=0.04263705.

Denominator:8.314 *293=2436.082.

So, x=0.04263705 /2436.082 ≈0.00001749.

So, x=1.749e-5.

So, Δp=101325 *1.749e-5 ≈1.773 Pa.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different value for p0, such as 100,000 Pa instead of 101,325 Pa. Let me try that.

If p0=100,000 Pa,

Δp=100000 *1.749e-5=1.749 Pa.

Still doesn't match the options.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different temperature, say 273 K (0°C).

Let me compute x with T=273 K.

x=(0.02897 *9.81 *0.15)/(8.314 *273).

Denominator:8.314 *273≈2272.602.

So,

x=0.04263705/2272.602≈0.00001876 ≈1.876e-5.

Δp=101325 *1.876e-5≈1.900 Pa.

Still not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using M=0.029 kg/mol, which would give x= (0.029 *9.81 *0.15)/(8.314 *293).

Compute numerator:0.029 *9.81=0.28449; *0.15=0.0426735.

Denominator same as before:2436.082.

x=0.0426735/2436.082≈1.752e-5.

Δp=101325 *1.752e-5≈1.774 Pa.

Still same result.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the vessel's height in centimeters, so h=0.15 m is correct.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the problem expects me to approximate the pressure difference as Δp = (p0 M g h)/(R T) and express it in terms of 1e-5, which would be 1.7e-5, corresponding to option B.

Wait, but in my calculation, that gives 1.773 Pa, which is 1.773e-3 Pa, not 1.7e-5. So perhaps I'm missing a factor of 1000. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula without multiplying by p0, but that would give x=1.749e-5, which is option B.

Wait, that's possible. Let me check.

If the problem is asking for the term (M g h)/(R T), which is x=1.749e-5, then option B is 1.7e-5, which is very close.

So, perhaps the problem is asking for this term x, not the actual pressure difference. But that seems unlikely because the question specifically asks for the pressure difference.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the term (M g h)/(R T) as the pressure difference in some unit system, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but the options are given without units, so perhaps the answer is 1.7e-5, which is option B.

Given that my calculation for x is approximately 1.749e-5, which is close to option B:1.7e-5.

So, perhaps the intended answer is option B.
</think>

The problem involves calculating the pressure difference between the top and bottom of a laboratory vessel of height 15 cm using the barometric formula. The barometric formula relates the pressure change with altitude as:

\[
\Delta p = p_0 \cdot \frac{M g h}{R T}
\]

where:
- \( p_0 \) is the pressure at sea level (\( 101325 \, \text{Pa} \)),
- \( M \) is the molar mass of air (\( 0.02897 \, \text{kg/mol} \)),
- \( g \) is the acceleration due to gravity (\( 9.81 \, \text{m/s}^2 \)),
- \( R \) is the universal gas constant (\( 8.314 \, \text{J/(mol·K)} \)),
- \( T \) is the temperature (\( 293 \, \text{K} \)),
- \( h \) is the height of the vessel (\( 0.15 \, \text{m} \)).

### Step 1: Compute the term \( \frac{M g h}{R T} \)
1. Calculate the numerator:
   \[
   M g h = 0.02897 \cdot 9.81 \cdot 0.15 = 0.04263705 \, \text{J/(mol·m)}.
   \]
2. Calculate the denominator:
   \[
   R T = 8.314 \cdot 293 = 2436.082 \, \text{J/(mol·K)}.
   \]
3. Divide the numerator by the denominator:
   \[
   \frac{M g h}{R T} = \frac{0.04263705}{2436.082} \approx 1.749 \times 10^{-5}.
   \]

### Step 2: Calculate the pressure difference
The pressure difference is:
\[
\Delta p = p_0 \cdot \frac{M g h}{R T} = 101325 \cdot 1.749 \times 10^{-5} \approx 1.773 \, \text{Pa}.
\]

### Step 3: Compare with the options
The calculated value of \( \Delta p \) is approximately \( 1.773 \, \text{Pa} \). However, the options are given in the range of \( 10^{-5} \), suggesting the problem may be asking for the term \( \frac{M g h}{R T} \) alone, which is \( 1.749 \times 10^{-5} \). This matches closely with option **B: \( 1.7 \times 10^{-5} \)**.

### Conclusion
The intended answer is likely the term \( \frac{M g h}{R T} \), which corresponds to option **B**.

**Answer: B**
