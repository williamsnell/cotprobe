Okay, so I have this physics problem here about calculating the net dipole moment in Debyes for two different situations. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step.

First, I remember that dipole moment is calculated using the formula: μ = q * d. Where q is the charge and d is the distance between the charges. But wait, q here would be the magnitude of the charges, right? Because dipole moment is a vector quantity, but since we're dealing with magnitude, I can just multiply the absolute values.

The problem gives me two scenarios: part (a) and (b). Let's tackle them one by one.

Starting with part (a): It says one +1 and one -1 ion separated by 2 × 10^-8 cm. So each charge is ±1, and the distance is 2e-8 cm. But wait, the charge given in the problem is 4.80 × 10^-10 esu per charge. So each +1 and -1 ion has a charge of 4.80e-10 esu. Oh wait, because one charge equals 4.80e-10 esu. So for part (a), each ion contributes that charge.

So the dipole moment μ for part (a) would be q * d. But wait, the charges are +1 and -1, so their individual charges are each 4.80e-10 esu. So the dipole moment is 4.80e-10 esu * 2e-8 cm. Let me calculate that.

4.80e-10 * 2e-8 = (4.80 * 2) * 1e-18 = 9.6e-18 esu-cm. Now, since 1 Debye is 1e-18 esu-cm, this μ in Debyes would be 9.6e-18 / 1e-18 = 9.6 Debye. Wait, but that's just part (a). Wait, looking at the options, none of them have 9.6 as the first value. Wait, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait a second, no, let me check. The options are for both (a) and (b). So the first number in each option is for (a) and the second for (b). So looking for 9.6 and something else. Looking at the options, option H is 9.6 and 19.2. So that seems possible. But wait, let me double-check.

Wait, the problem says part (a) is +1 and -1, so each has a charge of 4.80e-10 esu. So μ = (4.80e-10) * (2e-8 cm) = 9.6e-18 esu-cm, which is 9.6 Debye. That's correct.

Now for part (b): one +2 and one -2 ion, same separation. So each charge is twice that of part (a), so 2 * 4.80e-10 = 9.60e-10 esu. So the dipole moment would be 9.60e-10 * 2e-8 cm = 19.2e-18 esu-cm, which is 19.2 Debye.

So part (a) is 9.6, part (b) is 19.2. Looking at the options, option H is 9.6 and 19.2. So that's the one. Let me check the options again.

Options:
A: 10.8, 21.6
B: 10.2, 20.4
C:8.6, 17.2
D:8,16
E:7.2,14.4
F:9.1, 18.2
G:11,22
H:9.6,19.2
I:12.4,24.8
J:7.8,15.6

Yes, option H matches. So the answer should be H:9.6 and 19.2 Debyes.

The dipole moment for part (a) is calculated as \( \mu = q \cdot d = (4.80 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{esu}) \cdot (2 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{cm}) = 9.6 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{esu-cm} = 9.6 \, \text{Debyes} \). For part (b), with charges doubled, \( \mu = (2 \cdot 4.80 \times 10^{-10}) \cdot (2 \times 10^{-8}) = 19.2 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{esu-cm} = 19.2 \, \text{Debyes} \). The correct option is H.

Answer: H
