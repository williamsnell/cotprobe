Okay, so I've got this statistics problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to solve it. Let me read it again. A student organization wants to estimate the proportion of students who favor showing movies biweekly instead of monthly. They need to determine how many students to sample to get a 90% confidence interval with a width of at most 0.08.

Hmm, I remember that when dealing with proportions, the confidence interval formula is something like p hat plus or minus z times the standard error. The standard error for a proportion is sqrt(p(1-p)/n), right? But wait, since we don't know the true proportion p before sampling, we usually use the sample proportion p hat. But in this case, since we're trying to find the sample size n, maybe we should use the most conservative estimate for p, which is 0.5 because that gives the maximum variance. Yeah, that makes sense because p(1-p) is maximized when p=0.5.

So, the formula for the confidence interval width is 2 times z * sqrt(p(1-p)/n). Wait, no, actually, the width is 2 times the margin of error, which is z * sqrt(p(1-p)/n). So in this problem, the width is given as 0.08, which is the total width, so each side is 0.04. So the formula we need is:

Width = 2 * (z * sqrt(p(1-p)/n)) ≤ 0.08

But since we don't know p, we use p=0.5, which gives the maximum possible standard error. So substituting p=0.5:

0.08 = 2 * z * sqrt(0.5*(0.5)/n)

Wait, actually, wait. The width is the total width, so 0.08 is equal to 2 * (z * sqrt(p(1-p)/n)). So to find n, we can rearrange the formula.

First, let's get the z-score for a 90% confidence interval. I think for 90%, the z-score is 1.645. Wait, no, wait. Let me think. The confidence level is 90%, so the area in the middle is 0.90, and the tails are 0.05 each. So the critical z-value is the one where the cumulative probability is 0.95. Looking at the standard normal distribution, that's approximately 1.645. Yeah, that's correct.

So, plugging in the numbers:

0.08 = 2 * 1.645 * sqrt(0.25/n)

Wait, because p(1-p) when p=0.5 is 0.25. So sqrt(0.25/n) is sqrt(1/(4n)) which is 1/(2*sqrt(n)).

So let me write the equation:

0.08 = 2 * 1.645 * sqrt(0.25/n)

Simplify that:

0.08 = 2 * 1.645 * (0.5) / sqrt(n)

Because sqrt(0.25) is 0.5.

So 0.08 = (1.645) * (1) / sqrt(n)

Wait, because 2 * 0.5 is 1. So:

0.08 = 1.645 / sqrt(n)

Now, solving for sqrt(n):

sqrt(n) = 1.645 / 0.08

Let me calculate that. 1.645 divided by 0.08. Let's see, 0.08 goes into 1.645 how many times?

0.08 * 20 = 1.6. So 1.645 - 1.6 = 0.045. Then 0.08 goes into 0.045 about 0.5625 times. So total is 20.5625. So sqrt(n) ≈ 20.5625.

Then, n ≈ (20.5625)^2. Let me calculate that. 20^2 is 400, 0.5625^2 is about 0.316, and cross terms are 2*20*0.5625=22.5. So 400 + 22.5 + 0.316 ≈ 422.816. So n is approximately 423.

Wait, but let me double-check that calculation. Because 20.5625 squared is:

20.5625 * 20.5625. Let me compute it step by step.

First, 20 * 20.5625 = 411.25
Then 0.5625 * 20.5625. Let's compute that:

0.5625 * 20 = 11.25
0.5625 * 0.5625 = 0.31640625
So 11.25 + 0.31640625 = 11.56640625
Adding to 411.25: 411.25 + 11.56640625 = 422.81640625

So n ≈ 422.816, which we round up to 423, since sample size can't be a fraction.

Looking at the options, option C is 423, which matches. So the answer should be C.

To determine the required sample size for a 90% confidence interval with a width of 0.08, we use the formula for the confidence interval width:

\[
\text{Width} = 2 \times z \times \sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}
\]

Given \( p = 0.5 \) (the most conservative estimate), \( z = 1.645 \) (for 90% confidence), and a width of 0.08:

\[
0.08 = 2 \times 1.645 \times \sqrt{\frac{0.25}{n}}
\]

Simplifying:

\[
0.08 = \frac{1.645}{\sqrt{n}}
\]

Solving for \( n \):

\[
\sqrt{n} = \frac{1.645}{0.08} \approx 20.5625
\]

\[
n \approx 20.5625^2 \approx 423
\]

Thus, the required sample size is **423**, corresponding to option C.
