Okay, so I've got this question about the Navigation Acts of 1651. I'm a bit rusty on my history, but I'll try to think it through. The question is asking what the desired outcome of the legislation was. The options are A through J, each suggesting a different goal.

First, I remember that the Navigation Acts were a series of laws passed by the English Parliament, particularly during the Protectorate under Oliver Cromwell, which is when the Rump Parliament was active. These acts were meant to regulate trade and strengthen England's economic and naval power.

Looking at the excerpts provided, both [A] and [N] parts of the act are mentioned. From what I recall, the Navigation Acts imposed restrictions on trade. Specifically, they required that goods from English colonies could only be transported in English ships, and certain goods had to be shipped to England before being re-exported elsewhere. This was part of a mercantilist policy aimed at ensuring that England's colonies served the mother country's interests.

So, the main goal of these acts was to control colonial trade for the benefit of England. By doing so, they aimed to prevent other European powers, particularly the Dutch, from interfering in English trade. The Dutch were major players in maritime trade at the time, and the Navigation Acts were a way to limit their influence.

Looking at the options:

A: To prevent the Dutch from establishing colonies in North America. I'm not sure that's the main point; the acts were more about controlling trade rather than colonial establishment.

B: To encourage domestic industries by limiting imports. That's part of mercantilism, but the primary aim was more about controlling trade routes and colonies.

C: Economic cooperation with colonies. Maybe, but the acts were more about regulating and monopolizing trade rather than fostering cooperation.

D: Fur trade monopoly. I don't think that's the main focus here.

E: Naval power via maritime trade. While the acts did strengthen the navy, I think the more direct aim was to control trade.

F: Slave trade domination. The slave trade was a part of the broader colonial economy, but the acts were more about general trade control.

G: Expel French from sea trade. The main competitor was the Dutch, not the French, so probably not.

H: Spice trade monopoly. The acts were broader, not just about spices.

I: Prevent colonies from getting cheap goods. That's a possibility, but again, the main aim was about controlling trade to benefit England.

J: End Dutch domination of maritime trade by limiting their ability to move goods. This sounds more accurate because the Navigation Acts were designed to restrict other nations, especially the Dutch, from handling English colonial trade. They required that only English ships carry goods to and from the colonies, which would limit the Dutch merchants who were heavily involved in that trade.

So, putting it all together, the Navigation Acts were meant to ensure that all colonial trade benefited England and not other countries like the Dutch Republic. Therefore, option J seems to be the correct answer.

The Navigation Acts of 1651 were part of England's mercantilist policies aimed at controlling trade for the benefit of the mother country. They required goods from English colonies to be transported only in English ships, limiting the involvement of competitors like the Dutch. This legislation sought to restrict the Dutch from dominating maritime trade by limiting their ability to transport goods between England and her colonies, as well as goods to and from other countries. 

Answer: J
