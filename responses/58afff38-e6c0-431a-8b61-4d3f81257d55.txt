Okay, so I have this question about group theory, specifically dealing with subgroups and cosets. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question has two statements, and I need to determine if each is true or false. Then, based on that, choose the correct option from A to J. Let's break down each statement one by one.

**Statement 1:** If H is a subgroup of G and a belongs to G, then aH is a subgroup of G if and only if a is in H.

Hmm, I remember that aH is called a left coset of H in G. A coset is formed by multiplying each element of H by a fixed element a of G. Now, for aH to be a subgroup, it must satisfy the subgroup criteria: closure, identity, inverses.

Wait, but in general, a coset aH is not a subgroup unless H is trivial or a is in H. Because if a is not in H, then aH is just a shifted version of H, which doesn't include the identity element unless a is the identity. Wait, no, if a is in H, then aH would be H itself, which is a subgroup. If a is not in H, then aH is a proper coset, which doesn't contain the identity element (since H does, and a is not in H, so a* e = a is not in H). So for aH to be a subgroup, a must be in H, because only then is aH equal to H, which is a subgroup.

So the statement says that aH is a subgroup if and only if a is in H. That sounds correct. If a is in H, aH=H, which is a subgroup. If aH is a subgroup, then since H is a subgroup, aH must equal H, which implies a is in H. So Statement 1 is True.

**Statement 2:** If H is a subgroup of G and a and b belong to G, then aH = bH if and only if ab is in H.

Wait, this seems a bit tricky. Let's unpack it. aH equals bH as sets. That means every element of aH is in bH and vice versa. So there exists some h1, h2 in H such that a = bh1 and b = ah2. Alternatively, maybe I should think in terms of the condition for cosets being equal.

I remember that aH = bH if and only if b^{-1}a is in H. Because if aH = bH, then a = b h for some h in H, so b^{-1}a = h, which is in H. Conversely, if b^{-1}a is in H, then a = b h, so aH = b H.

Wait, but the statement says aH = bH iff ab is in H. That seems different. Let me check.

Suppose aH = bH. Then from the condition, (b^{-1}a) must be in H. But the statement says ab is in H. So unless H is abelian, these are different. Let's think with an example.

Take G as the integers mod 6 under addition. Let H be {0, 3}, which is a subgroup. Let a = 1 and b = 4. Then aH = {1,4}, and bH = {4,1}, so aH = bH. Now, ab in this case would be 1*4=4 mod 6. Is 4 in H? H is {0,3}, so 4 is not in H. So in this case, aH = bH but ab is not in H. So the statement that aH = bH iff ab is in H would be false. Therefore, Statement 2 is False.

Wait, let me double-check. In additive terms, ab would be a + b. So in the example, a=1, b=4. a + b =5 mod6, which is not in H. But aH = {1,4} and bH = {4,1} are equal, but ab=5 is not in H. So this shows that the condition in Statement 2 is false. Therefore, Statement 2 is False.

So, Statement 1 is True, Statement 2 is False. Looking at the options, the option C is True, False. Option C is the correct choice.

The first statement is true because for aH to be a subgroup, a must be in H, making aH equal to H itself. The second statement is false because the condition for aH = bH is that b⁻¹a is in H, not necessarily ab.
