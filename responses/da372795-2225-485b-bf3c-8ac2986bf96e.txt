Okay, I need to answer this economics question. Let me read it carefully. The question is asking which school of economists defended Say's Law and which prominent economist disputed it. The options are from A to J, each pairing a school with a economist.

First, I should recall what Say's Law is. I remember that Say's Law states that supply creates its own demand. In other words, production leads to income, which then drives demand. This was a key concept in classical economics. So the school that defended Say's Law would likely be the Classical school.

Looking at the options, option F says Neoclassical school, Keynes, but I think Say's Law is more associated with classical economists, not neoclassical. Neoclassical is a later development, so maybe that's not it. Option H mentions the Austrian school and Keynes, but I don't think Austrian economists are the ones who defended Say's Law. Keynes, on the other hand, is known for disputing Say's Law.

Wait, what about option F again? It says Neoclassical school defended Say's Law, but I'm pretty sure the classical school is the one that supported it. So perhaps option F is incorrect.

Looking for the correct pairing: the Classical school defended Say's Law. Then, who disputed it? Keynes. So which option pairs Classical with Keynes? Let me check the options. Option F says Neoclassical, Keynes. Option H says Austrian, Keynes. Option I says Keynesian, Hayek. Hmm, none of these directly say Classical and Keynes. Wait, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, looking back, option F is "Classical school, Keynes." No, option F says "Neoclassical school, Keynes." So if the correct answer is Classical school defended Say's Law, and Keynes disputed it, then the correct pairing would be Classical school and Keynes. But looking at the options, I don't see an option where Classical is paired with Keynes.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check each option again. Option F: Neoclassical, Keynes. Option H: Austrian, Keynes. Option I: Keynesian, Hayek. Option J: Monetarist, Samuelson. Option F is the only one with Keynes as the disputant, but it's paired with Neoclassical, which I think is incorrect because Say's Law is classical.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the schools. The classical economists, like Ricardo and Say, supported Say's Law. Then Keynes disputed it in his General Theory. So the school that defended it would be the Classical school, and the economist who disputed it is Keynes.

Looking at the options, which one pairs Classical with Keynes? Let me check each option again:

A: Chicago, Stiglitz – No.
B: Marxist, Minsky – No.
C: Behavioral, Akerlof – No.
D: Neoclassical, Friedman – No.
E: Neoclassical, Coase – No.
F: Neoclassical, Keynes – No.
G: Supply-side, Krugman – No.
H: Austrian, Keynes – No.
I: Keynesian, Hayek – No.
J: Monetarist, Samuelson – No.

Wait, none of the options pair Classical with Keynes. Did I miss something? Maybe the options are correct, and I'm misunderstanding something.

Wait, let me think again. The question is about which school defended Say's Law. Say's Law is a classical concept, so the Classical school. Then, the economist who disputed it is Keynes. So the correct pairing should be Classical school and Keynes. But looking at the options, none have that. The closest is option F, which says Neoclassical school and Keynes, but that's not right because Neoclassical is different from Classical.

Wait, maybe I'm wrong about the schools. Perhaps the Neoclassical school includes the ideas of Say's Law? Or maybe the question considers the Neoclassical as defenders, but I thought they moved beyond that. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is option F, even though it's not perfect. Or maybe I'm making a mistake elsewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is option F: Neoclassical school, Keynes. But I'm not sure because Say's Law is more classical. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option F, but I'm confused.

Wait, another approach: who disputed Say's Law? Keynes did. So the second part of the answer is Keynes. Looking at the options, which ones have Keynes as the disputant? Options F, H, and I. Option F: Neoclassical, Keynes. Option H: Austrian, Keynes. Option I: Keynesian, Hayek.

So the correct pairing would be the school that defended Say's Law (Classical) and Keynes as the disputant. But none of the options have Classical and Keynes. Therefore, perhaps the correct answer is option F, even though it's not exactly correct, but maybe the question considers the Neoclassical as defenders. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is option F.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me confirm: Say's Law is part of classical economics, and Keynes disputed it. So the correct answer would be that the Classical school defended it, and Keynes disputed it. So looking at the options, the only one with Keynes as the disputant is option F (Neoclassical), H (Austrian), and I (Keynesian, Hayek). None have Classical and Keynes. So perhaps the question is incorrect, but among the options, the best fit is F, even though it's not accurate.

Wait, perhaps the answer is option F, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in considering the schools. Another thought: the Neoclassical school includes Say's Law in their theories? Or perhaps the question is considering that the Neoclassicals, being more modern, might have incorporated Say's Law, but I think that's not accurate.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is option F, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option F, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, another angle: who are prominent economists who disputed Say's Law? Keynes is the main one. So the second part is Keynes. Now, the first part is the school that defended Say's Law. So the answer should be Classical school and Keynes. But the options don't have that. Therefore, perhaps the correct answer is option F, even though it's not perfect.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is option F, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the schools. Maybe the Neoclassical school includes the Say's Law as part of their framework, so the answer would be F.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option F, but I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is option F, but I think the correct pairing is Classical and Keynes, which is not among the options. So perhaps the question has an error, but among the given options, the best fit is F: Neoclassical school, Keynes.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the answer is option F. Because the question is about which school defended Say's Law. The classical school is the defender, but if that option isn't present, perhaps the next best is Neoclassical, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is option F, but I'm not confident.

Wait, perhaps the answer is option F, but I think the correct answer should be the Classical school and Keynes. Since that's not an option, perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is option F, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option F: Neoclassical school, Keynes. But I'm not entirely confident because Say's Law is classical, not neoclassical.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is option F. I think I have to go with that.

The question asks which school of economists defended Say's Law and which prominent economist disputed it. Say's Law, which states that supply creates its own demand, is a key concept in classical economics. Therefore, the school that defended Say's Law is the Classical school. Keynes, on the other hand, disputed Say's Law in his General Theory. Among the options provided, the correct pairing should be Classical school and Keynes. However, none of the options explicitly pair these two. The closest option is F: Neoclassical school, Keynes, even though it is not entirely accurate. Given the available choices, the best answer is:

**Answer: F**
