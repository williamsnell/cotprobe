Okay, so I'm trying to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers: 2^1001 - 1 and 2^1012 - 1. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with numbers of the form 2^n - 1, there's a property related to their GCD. Let me think about that.

I think the GCD of 2^a - 1 and 2^b - 1 is 2^gcd(a, b) - 1. Wait, is that right? Yeah, I think that's a theorem or something. So, the GCD of these two numbers would be 2 raised to the GCD of their exponents minus 1.

So, first, I need to find the GCD of 1001 and 1012. Let me compute that. To find GCD(1001, 1012), I can use the Euclidean algorithm.

Let's see: 1012 divided by 1001 is 1 with a remainder of 11. So, GCD(1001, 1012) = GCD(1001, 11). Now, 1001 divided by 11 is 91 with no remainder because 11 times 91 is 1001. So, the GCD is 11.

Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 11 times 91 is 1001, yes. So, the GCD of 1001 and 1012 is 11. So, then the GCD of 2^1001 -1 and 2^1012 -1 is 2^11 -1.

What's 2^11? Let's calculate that. 2^10 is 1024, so 2^11 is 2048. So, 2048 minus 1 is 2047. So, the GCD should be 2047.

Wait, but looking at the options, option I is 2047. So, is that the answer? Let me double-check.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the GCD calculation. Let me go through it again.

Compute GCD(1001, 1012):

1012 - 1001 = 11. So, GCD(1001, 11). Now, 1001 รท 11: 11 * 90 = 990, 1001 - 990 = 11, so 11*91=1001. So, yes, GCD is 11.

So, the GCD is 2^11 -1=2047. So, the answer should be option I: 2047.

The greatest common divisor of \(2^{1001} - 1\) and \(2^{1012} - 1\) is \(2^{\gcd(1001, 1012)} - 1\). Using the Euclidean algorithm, \(\gcd(1001, 1012) = 11\), so the GCD is \(2^{11} - 1 = 2047\).
