Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about CPA liability, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me think through it step by step.

The question is asking about the legal liability when a CPA recklessly departs from the standards of due care during an audit. The key term here is "recklessly," which I think implies a higher level of negligence than just ordinary carelessness. So, the CPA isn't just making a mistake but is actually being reckless, which is a more serious form of negligence.

Looking at the options, I need to determine which one applies when a CPA is negligent in such a way that affects third parties who don't know the CPA. Let's go through each option.

Option A: Unintentional tort. A tort is a wrongful act leading to civil liability. Unintentional usually refers to negligence, but here the recklessness might be a more specific type of tort.

Option B: Gross negligence. Gross negligence is a more severe form of negligence, where the person shows a wanton disregard for the rights of others. This seems closer because the CPA was reckless, which fits the idea of gross negligence.

Option C: Fraud. Fraud involves intentional deceit, which isn't mentioned here. The question doesn't say the CPA intended to deceive, just that they were reckless.

Option D: Breach of contract. This would be if the CPA had a contractual relationship with the third party. But the question says the third parties are unknown to the CPA, so it's more about liability without a direct contract.

Option E: Breach of warranty. This typically applies to contracts as well, so probably not the right choice here.

Option F: Negligence. This is the general failure to meet the standard of care. But since the CPA was reckless, it's more than ordinary negligenceâ€”gross negligence would be better.

Option G: Misrepresentation. This involves false statements, which isn't the case here unless the CPA's actions led to false information, but the question is more about the CPA's recklessness rather than providing false info.

Option H: Constructive fraud. This is when someone acts in a way that's as bad as fraud, but without intent. It's more about misleading someone, but again, the question is about recklessness in auditing.

Option I: Professional malpractice. This is similar to negligence but specific to professionals. Since the CPA failed to meet the standard of care, this could be it. But is it the same as gross negligence?

Option J: Strict liability. This applies regardless of fault, like in product liability. Doesn't seem to fit here because the CPA's liability is based on their actions, not strict liability principles.

Now, the question is about third parties unknown to the CPA. In auditing, CPAs typically owe a duty to the entity they audit and sometimes to third parties like creditors. If the CPA is negligent, especially grossly negligent, they can be liable to those third parties even if they didn't know them directly.

So, between B (gross negligence) and I (professional malpractice). Professional malpractice is a type of negligence, often considered a subset under tort law. Gross negligence is a higher form of ordinary negligence. The term "recklessly" suggests gross negligence because it indicates a flagrant disregard for the standard of care.

Therefore, the correct answer is B: Gross negligence.
