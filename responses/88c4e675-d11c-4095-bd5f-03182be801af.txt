Okay, so I've got this question about microscopes and magnification. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through. The question is about a compound microscope with an objective that gives a lateral magnification of 10x. They want to know what focal length ocular (eyepiece) will result in an overall magnification of 100x.

Wait, right, a compound microscope has two main lenses: the objective and the eyepiece. The total magnification is the product of the magnifications of these two. So the formula I remember is total magnification M = M_objective * M_eyepiece.

The objective here is 10x, so M_total = 10 * M_eyepiece. They want M_total to be 100x. So I can set up the equation 100 = 10 * M_eyepiece. Solving for M_eyepiece, that gives M_eyepiece = 100 / 10 = 10x.

Wait, but wait. The eyepiece magnification isn't just a direct number; it's based on the focal lengths. Oh right, the magnification of the eyepiece is given by the formula M_eyepiece = 25 cm / f, where f is the focal length of the eyepiece in centimeters. Because the standard near point is at 25 cm.

So M_eyepiece = 25 / f. We found that M_eyepiece needs to be 10x. So 10 = 25 / f. Solving for f, multiply both sides by f: 10f = 25. Then f = 25 / 10 = 2.5 cm.

Looking at the options, option D is 2.5 cm. So that should be the answer.

Wait a second, let me make sure I didn't mix up anything. The formula for the eyepiece magnification is correct, right? Yes, M = 25/f. And the total magnification is the product of the objective and eyepiece magnifications. So 10x * 10x = 100x. Yep, that adds up.

So the focal length of the ocular (eyepiece) should be 2.5 cm, which is option D.

To determine the focal length of the ocular that produces an overall magnification of 100x when combined with an objective of 10x, we use the formula for total magnification in a compound microscope: 

\[
M_{\text{total}} = M_{\text{objective}} \times M_{\text{eyepiece}}
\]

Given \( M_{\text{total}} = 100 \) and \( M_{\text{objective}} = 10 \), we solve for \( M_{\text{eyepiece}} \):

\[
100 = 10 \times M_{\text{eyepiece}} \implies M_{\text{eyepiece}} = \frac{100}{10} = 10
\]

The magnification of the eyepiece is related to its focal length \( f \) by the formula:

\[
M_{\text{eyepiece}} = \frac{25}{f}
\]

Substituting \( M_{\text{eyepiece}} = 10 \):

\[
10 = \frac{25}{f} \implies f = \frac{25}{10} = 2.5 \, \text{cm}
\]

Thus, the required focal length of the ocular is 2.5 cm, corresponding to option D.

Answer: D
