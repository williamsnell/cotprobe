Okay, so I've got this problem about the bulk modulus of elasticity for a liquid. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my mechanics, but let me think through this step by step.

Alright, the question says that a liquid in a cylinder has a volume of 1 liter, which is 1000 cm³, at 1 MN/m² of pressure. Then, when the pressure increases to 2 MN/m², the volume decreases to 995 cm³. I need to find the bulk modulus of elasticity.

Wait, wait, bulk modulus... right, it's a measure of the resistance of a material to compression. The formula I remember is the bulk modulus (K) equals the pressure (ΔP) divided by the relative volume change (ΔV/V). But wait, since the volume decreases with pressure, the relative change is negative, but the modulus is always positive, so I guess I'll take the absolute value.

So, the formula is K = ΔP / (ΔV / V). Let me write that down. K equals delta P over (delta V over V). Or, rearranged, K = (P2 - P1) / ((V2 - V1)/V1). Yeah, that makes sense because P1 is the initial pressure, P2 is the final pressure, V1 is the initial volume, and V2 is the final volume.

Let me plug in the numbers. P1 is 1 MN/m², P2 is 2 MN/m². V1 is 1000 cm³, V2 is 995 cm³. So ΔP is 2 - 1 = 1 MN/m². And ΔV is 995 - 1000 = -5 cm³. But since I'm taking the absolute value, it'll be 5 cm³.

Wait, but the units for volume are in cm³, and pressure is in MN/m². I need to make sure the units are consistent. Oh, right, 1 m³ is 1e6 liters, but wait, in this case, 1 liter is 1000 cm³, which is 0.001 m³ because 1 m³ is 1,000,000 cm³. So 1000 cm³ is 0.001 m³.

Wait, no, that can't be right. Let me double-check. Wait, 1 m³ is 1,000,000 liters? No, wait, no. Wait, 1 m³ is 1,000,000 cm³. Because 1 m is 100 cm, so (100 cm)^3 is 1,000,000 cm³. So 1000 cm³ is 0.001 m³. Right, so V1 is 0.001 m³.

So ΔV is -5 cm³, which is -5e-6 m³. But since I'm taking the absolute value, it's 5e-6 m³.

Wait, no, wait. Because 1 cm³ is 1e-6 m³. So 5 cm³ is 5e-6 m³.

So now, putting it all together. ΔP is 1 MN/m², which is 1e6 N/m². Because 1 MN is 1e6 N, right? So 1 MN/m² = 1e6 N/m².

So K = ΔP / (ΔV / V1). Let's compute ΔV/V1. ΔV is 5e-6 m³, V1 is 0.001 m³. So 5e-6 / 0.001 = 5e-3, or 0.005.

So K = 1e6 N/m² / 0.005. Let's compute that. 1e6 divided by 0.005 equals 2e8 N/m². Wait, 1e6 / 0.005 = (1e6) * (200) because 1/0.005 is 200. So 1e6 * 200 is 2e8 N/m².

Wait, but 2e8 N/m² is 200 MPa, because 1 MPa is 1e6 N/m². So 2e8 is 200 MPa. But wait, let me check the options. Option H is 200 MPa. But wait, I'm a bit confused because I remember that the bulk modulus for liquids is usually higher than that. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, wait. Let me go through it again. V1 is 1000 cm³, which is 0.001 m³. P1 is 1 MN/m², which is 1e6 N/m². P2 is 2e6 N/m². So ΔP is 1e6 N/m².

V2 is 995 cm³, which is 995e-6 m³ = 0.000995 m³. So ΔV is V2 - V1 = 0.000995 - 0.001 = -0.000005 m³, which is -5e-6 m³. The absolute value is 5e-6 m³.

So ΔV/V1 is (5e-6) / (0.001) = 5e-3, which is 0.005.

So K = ΔP / (ΔV/V1) = (1e6) / (0.005) = 2e8 N/m², which is 200 MPa. So option H.

Wait, but I'm a bit uncertain because sometimes the formula might be expressed differently. Let me check the formula again. The bulk modulus is defined as K = -ΔP / (ΔV / V), where the negative sign indicates that volume decreases with pressure. Since we're taking the magnitude, we can ignore the sign, so it's correct.

But wait, when I look at the options, option E is 500 MPa, which is higher. Did I make a mistake in the volume calculation? Let me double-check the volumes. V1 is 1 liter, which is 1000 cm³. V2 is 995 cm³, so the change is -5 cm³. So 5 cm³ is 5e-6 m³. So 5e-6 divided by 0.001 m³ is indeed 0.005. So the calculation seems correct.

Hmm, but I'm a bit confused because liquids usually have a higher bulk modulus. For example, water has a bulk modulus around 2.2 GPa, which is 2200 MPa. But maybe in this problem, it's lower. Alternatively, perhaps I misread the units.

Wait, wait. The pressure given is in MN/m². Wait, MN is mega Newtons, right? So 1 MN/m² is 1e6 N/m², which is 1 MPa. So the pressures are 1 MPa and 2 MPa. So ΔP is 1 MPa.

So K = 1 MPa / (0.005) = 200 MPa. So the answer should be H: 200 MPa.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't mix up the units. Wait, 1 liter is 1000 cm³, correct. 1 m³ is 1e6 liters, so 1 liter is 0.001 m³, yes.

So yeah, the calculation seems right. So the bulk modulus is 200 MPa. So the correct answer is H.

The bulk modulus of elasticity (K) is calculated using the formula:

\[
K = \frac{\Delta P}{\Delta V / V_1}
\]

Given:
- Initial pressure, \( P_1 = 1 \, \text{MN/m}^2 = 1 \, \text{MPa} \)
- Final pressure, \( P_2 = 2 \, \text{MN/m}^2 = 2 \, \text{MPa} \)
- Initial volume, \( V_1 = 1000 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.001 \, \text{m}^3 \)
- Final volume, \( V_2 = 995 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.000995 \, \text{m}^3 \)

The change in pressure is:
\[
\Delta P = P_2 - P_1 = 2 \, \text{MPa} - 1 \, \text{MPa} = 1 \, \text{MPa}
\]

The change in volume is:
\[
\Delta V = V_2 - V_1 = 0.000995 \, \text{m}^3 - 0.001 \, \text{m}^3 = -0.000005 \, \text{m}^3
\]

The relative volume change is:
\[
\frac{\Delta V}{V_1} = \frac{-0.000005}{0.001} = -0.005
\]

Taking the absolute value, the bulk modulus is:
\[
K = \frac{\Delta P}{\Delta V / V_1} = \frac{1 \, \text{MPa}}{0.005} = 200 \, \text{MPa}
\]

Thus, the bulk modulus of elasticity is **200 MPa**.
