Question:

Okay, so I need to figure out which fund type the donated land for the windmills should be reported in. Let me break down the information provided.

The City of Windemere is constructing windmills to generate power. They're financing this through a residential property tax levy for ten years. The revenues from utilities are supposed to cover all expenses. The land was donated by a local farmer. 

First, I should recall the different fund types and what they're used for. 

Looking at the options:

A: Permanent fund – usually for endowments where principal is kept intact, and only income is used. Not sure if this applies here since it's donated land for a project.

B: Internal Service fund – for internal services like police, fire, etc. Doesn't seem right because this is about a capital project.

C: Trust and Agency fund – for assets held in trust for specific purposes. Maybe, but I'm not certain.

D: Capital Projects fund – used for planning, financing, and accounting for capital projects. This seems relevant because the windmills are a capital project.

E: Enterprise fund – for activities that are self-sufficient, like utilities. The utility revenues are offsetting expenses, so maybe this is a possibility.

F: Debt Service fund – for debt-related payments. The financing is through a tax levy, but the land itself isn't debt.

G: General Fund – for general government activities. If the project is financed through taxes, maybe this, but the land is a specific asset.

H: Pension Trust – not related here.

I: Investment Trust – probably not, unless it's for investments, but the land is a donation.

J: Special Revenue fund – for specific revenue sources. The tax is a specific levy, but the land is a donated asset.

Wait, the land was donated. So, it's a non-cash asset. Since it's being used for a capital project, the Capital Projects fund (D) would be where such assets are reported. But wait, the Enterprise fund (E) is for operations that generate their own revenues, like utilities. The windmills' revenues are intended to cover expenses, so maybe E is also a consideration.

But the donated land is a capital asset. Typically, capital projects involve acquiring or constructing capital assets. So the land would be part of the Capital Projects fund. 

Alternatively, the Enterprise fund is used when the project is expected to generate sufficient revenue to cover its costs, including the debt service. Since the utility revenues are meant to offset all expenses, including the costs of the windmills, maybe it's an Enterprise fund.

Wait, but the land was donated, so it's not a revenue-generating asset itself. It's part of the project. So in government accounting, when you have a capital project, you'd use the Capital Projects fund to account for the costs and assets related to that project.

So I think the answer is D: Capital projects.

The donated land is a capital asset used for a capital project (constructing windmills). In government accounting, capital projects are typically reported in the Capital Projects fund. Therefore, the land should be reported in the Capital Projects fund.

Answer: D
