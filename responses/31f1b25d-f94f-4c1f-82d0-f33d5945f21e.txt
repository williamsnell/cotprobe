Okay, so I've got this limit problem to solve using Taylor's Approximation Theorem. The problem is the limit as x approaches 0 of [e^(x^4/2) - cos(x^2)] divided by x^4. Hmm, I remember that Taylor series expansions can help simplify expressions like this, especially when dealing with limits involving trigonometric or exponential functions.

First, I need to recall the Taylor series expansions for e^y and cos(z) around y=0 and z=0, respectively. The general form for e^y is 1 + y + y²/2! + y³/3! + y⁴/4! + ... and for cos(z) it's 1 - z²/2! + z⁴/4! - z⁶/6! + ... So, for small values of y and z, these expansions should be pretty accurate.

In this problem, y is x⁴/2 and z is x². Since x is approaching 0, both y and z will be small, so using the Taylor series up to a certain order should give a good approximation.

Let me start by expanding e^(x⁴/2). Using the Taylor series up to the x^4 term because higher-order terms will become negligible when divided by x^4. So, e^(x⁴/2) ≈ 1 + (x⁴/2) + (x⁴/2)^2 / 2! + ... Let me calculate this:

First term: 1
Second term: (x⁴)/2
Third term: (x⁸/4)/2 = x⁸/8. Wait, but when we're taking the limit as x approaches 0, terms like x^8 will be much smaller than x^4, so maybe we can ignore them for now. So, e^(x⁴/2) ≈ 1 + (x⁴)/2.

Next, let's expand cos(x²). Again, using the Taylor series up to the x^4 term. So cos(x²) ≈ 1 - (x²)^2 / 2! + higher-order terms. That simplifies to 1 - x^4/2.

Now, let's plug these approximations into the numerator: e^(x⁴/2) - cos(x²) ≈ [1 + (x^4)/2] - [1 - (x^4)/2]. Let's compute that:

1 + x⁴/2 -1 + x⁴/2 = (1-1) + (x⁴/2 + x⁴/2) = 0 + x^4. So the numerator simplifies to approximately x^4.

So now, the expression becomes [x^4] / x^4, which is 1. But wait, that would mean the limit is 1, right? But looking at the options, J is 1.0. But wait, maybe I went too far with the Taylor series. Let me check if I included enough terms.

Wait, I stopped at the x^4 term for e^(x^4/2), but perhaps I should include higher terms. Let's think again. The original expression is [e^(x^4/2) - cos(x²)] / x^4. So, if I expand e^(x^4/2) up to x^8, maybe that's necessary because when I subtract cos(x²), which is also expanded up to x^4, perhaps the next term in e^(x^4/2) will contribute to the numerator when considering the subtraction.

Wait, let me re-examine the expansion. e^(x^4/2) = 1 + (x^4/2) + (x^4/2)^2 / 2! + (x^4/2)^3 / 3! + ... So that's 1 + x^4/2 + x^8/(8) + higher terms. Similarly, cos(x²) = 1 - (x^2)^2/2! + (x^2)^4/4! - ... which is 1 - x^4/2 + x^8/24 - ... 

So, when I subtract cos(x²) from e^(x^4/2), let's write it out:

e^(x^4/2) - cos(x²) ≈ [1 + x^4/2 + x^8/(8)] - [1 - x^4/2 + x^8/24] 

Let me compute term by term:

1 cancels with -1: 0.

x^4/2 - (-x^4/2) = x^4/2 + x^4/2 = x^4.

Now, x^8/(8) - (x^8/24) = (3x^8 - x^8)/24 = (2x^8)/24 = x^8/12.

So, the numerator becomes x^4 + x^8/12. But when we divide by x^4, we get [x^4(1 + x^4/12)]/x^4 = 1 + x^4/12. As x approaches 0, x^4/12 approaches 0, so the limit would be 1. So the answer should be J: 1.0.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me check my math again because sometimes I might have made a mistake in the coefficients. Let me redo the expansion more carefully.

e^(x^4/2) = 1 + (x^4/2) + (x^4/2)^2 / 2 + (x^4/2)^3 / 6 + ... 

So, expanding up to x^8:

1 + x^4/2 + (x^8)/(8) + (x^12)/(48) + ... 

But since x is approaching 0, higher terms beyond x^8 might not affect the limit when divided by x^4, but perhaps I should include up to x^8 in both expansions.

Similarly, cos(x²) = 1 - (x^2)^2/2! + (x^2)^4/4! - (x^2)^6/6! + ... 

Which is 1 - x^4/2 + x^8/24 - x^12/720 + ... 

So, subtracting cos(x²) from e^(x^4/2):

[1 + x^4/2 + x^8/8] - [1 - x^4/2 + x^8/24] 

= (1 - 1) + (x^4/2 + x^4/2) + (x^8/8 - x^8/24) 

= 0 + x^4 + ( (3x^8 - x^8) ) /24 

= x^4 + (2x^8)/24 

= x^4 + x^8/12 

So, the numerator is x^4 + x^8/12. Dividing by x^4 gives 1 + x^4/12. As x→0, x^4/12 approaches 0, so the limit is 1. So the answer is J: 1.0.

Wait, but looking at the options, J is 1.0, which would make sense. But let me think again because sometimes when approximating, higher-order terms can sometimes affect the result if the lower terms cancel out. Did I make a mistake in the subtraction?

Wait, in the numerator, e^(x^4/2) is 1 + x^4/2 + x^8/8 + ... and cos(x²) is 1 - x^4/2 + x^8/24 - ... So subtracting, it's (1 + x^4/2 + x^8/8) - (1 - x^4/2 + x^8/24) = 0 + x^4 + (x^8/8 - x^8/24). 

Calculating x^8 terms: 1/8 - 1/24 = (3/24 -1/24) = 2/24 = 1/12. So x^8/12. So numerator is x^4 + x^8/12, over x^4 is 1 + x^4/12, which tends to 1. So yes, the limit is 1. So the correct answer is J.

Wait, but looking back, I think I might have made a mistake in the initial expansion. Because sometimes when you have functions like e^something and cos something, the expansions might have more terms contributing to the same power. Let me check again.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the standard limits or L’Hospital’s Rule, but the question specifies using Taylor's theorem, so I should stick to that.

Wait another thought: the expansion of e^y up to y^2 is 1 + y + y^2/2, so for y = x^4/2, that would be 1 + x^4/2 + (x^4/2)^2 / 2 = 1 + x^4/2 + x^8/(8). Similarly, cos(z) up to z^4 is 1 - z^2/2 + z^4/24, so for z = x^2, that's 1 - x^4/2 + x^8/24.

So, the difference e^(x^4/2) - cos(x^2) is [1 + x^4/2 + x^8/8] - [1 - x^4/2 + x^8/24] = 0 + x^4 + x^8 (1/8 - 1/24) = x^4 + x^8*(3/24 - 1/24) = x^4 + x^8*(2/24) = x^4 + x^8/12.

Divide by x^4: 1 + x^4/12. As x→0, x^4/12→0, so limit is 1. So yes, the answer is J: 1.0.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because another approach might suggest a different result. Let me try using L’Hospital’s Rule just to confirm, even though the question says to use Taylor's theorem. 

The original limit is [e^(x^4/2) - cos(x²)] / x^4. Plugging x=0 gives 0/0, so L’Hospital applies. Take derivative of numerator and denominator.

Denominator derivative: 4x^3.

Numerator derivative: d/dx [e^(x^4/2)] - d/dx [cos(x^2)].

Compute each:

d/dx e^(x^4/2) = e^(x^4/2) * (4x^3/2) = 2x^3 e^(x^4/2).

d/dx cos(x^2) = -sin(x^2) * 2x.

So, the derivative of the numerator is 2x^3 e^(x^4/2) - (-2x sin(x^2)) = 2x^3 e^(x^4/2) + 2x sin(x^2).

Now, the limit becomes [2x^3 e^(x^4/2) + 2x sin(x^2)] / (4x^3).

Simplify numerator and denominator:

Factor out 2x: 2x [x^2 e^(x^4/2) + sin(x^2)] / (4x^3) = [x^2 e^(x^4/2) + sin(x^2)] / (2x^2).

Now, as x→0, let's evaluate each term. e^(x^4/2) ≈1 + x^4/2, so x^2 e^(x^4/2) ≈x^2 (1 + x^4/2) = x^2 + x^6/2. Similarly, sin(x^2) ≈x^2 - x^6/6.

So, numerator becomes [x^2 + x^6/2 + x^2 - x^6/6] = 2x^2 + (x^6/2 - x^6/6) = 2x^2 + ( (3x^6 - x^6)/6 ) = 2x^2 + (2x^6)/6 = 2x^2 + x^6/3.

Divided by 2x^2: [2x^2 + x^6/3] / (2x^2) = (2x^2)/(2x^2) + (x^6/3)/(2x^2) = 1 + x^4/6. As x→0, x^4/6→0, so the limit is 1. So same result as before. So the limit is 1, which is option J.

To evaluate the limit $\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{e^\frac{x^4}{2} - \cos(x^2)}{x^4}$ using Taylor's Approximation Theorem, we expand the functions $e^{\frac{x^4}{2}}$ and $\cos(x^2)$ around $x=0$.

1. **Expand $e^{\frac{x^4}{2}}$ up to $x^8$:**
   \[
   e^{\frac{x^4}{2}} \approx 1 + \frac{x^4}{2} + \frac{x^8}{8}.
   \]

2. **Expand $\cos(x^2)$ up to $x^8$:**
   \[
   \cos(x^2) \approx 1 - \frac{x^4}{2} + \frac{x^8}{24}.
   \]

3. **Subtract the expansions:**
   \[
   e^{\frac{x^4}{2}} - \cos(x^2) \approx \left(1 + \frac{x^4}{2} + \frac{x^8}{8}\right) - \left(1 - \frac{x^4}{2} + \frac{x^8}{24}\right) = x^4 + \frac{x^8}{12}.
   \]

4. **Divide by $x^4$:**
   \[
   \frac{e^{\frac{x^4}{2}} - \cos(x^2)}{x^4} \approx \frac{x^4 + \frac{x^8}{12}}{x^4} = 1 + \frac{x^4}{12}.
   \]

5. **Take the limit as $x \to 0$:**
   \[
   \lim_{x \to 0} \left(1 + \frac{x^4}{12}\right) = 1.
   \]

Thus, the limit is **1.0**, corresponding to option **J**.
