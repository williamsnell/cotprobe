Question:

A corporation, under the authority of a statute of the state, sued to have condemned 1,000 acres of forested land owned by a timber company, which it planned to develop for use as a state recreational area and state game lands. After a hearing, the state court ordered possession of the land surrendered to the corporation, prior to determination of compensation, upon deposit in court of a sum deemed adequate to cover damages that might be awarded. The timber company immediately commenced an action to enjoin the court-ordered sale of its property. Which of the following would be the best ground for upholding the state court's order?

Options:

A: The Fifth Amendment's power of eminent domain, incorporated by the Fourteenth Amendment as applicable to the states, requires that payment be made prior to condemnation of the property.
B: The injured party has the right to refuse the condemnation of the property under any circumstances.
C: The power of eminent domain may only be delegated to a public authority through a legislative determination.
D: The power of eminent domain can be delegated to any entity, regardless of its public or private status.
E: The Fifth Amendment's power of eminent domain, incorporated by the Fourteenth Amendment as applicable to the states, does not require that payment be made prior to condemnation of the property.
F: The power of eminent domain may only be delegated directly to a private enterprise for a public related use or activity.
G: The injured party has not proved such irreparable injury as amounts to a "taking," but the state court's order is lawful nonetheless.
H: The injured party has not proved such irreparable injury to use as amounts to a "taking. "
I: The power of eminent domain may only be delegated to a private enterprise through a legislative determination.
J: The power of eminent domain can only be exercised by the state and cannot be delegated to a corporation.

Okay, so I've got this law question here about eminent domain. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to break it down. 

The question is about a corporation suing to condemn 1,000 acres of land owned by a timber company. They plan to develop it for a state recreational area and game lands. After a hearing, the state court ordered the timber company to surrender possession before determining compensation, but the corporation had to deposit a sum deemed adequate as security for damages.

The timber company is suing to enjoin the sale of their property, and we have to choose the best ground to uphold the state court's order.

So, the issue here is about the process of eminent domain. Let me recall: Eminent domain allows the government to take private property for public use, but they have to provide just compensation. The key points are the authority to take the land and the process involved.

Looking at the options, I see several about the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. The Fifth Amendment says that private property can't be taken for public use without just compensation. The Fourteenth Amendment applies this to the states, so states must provide compensation when they take property.

Wait, the question is about the order by the court. The corporation, acting under state authority, is taking the land. So the state is using its eminent domain power, and the corporation is the one taking possession before compensation is determined, but they've deposited a sum as security.

I remember that the traditional process involves the government taking the property, paying into court (as security), and the owner can later claim compensation. But there's a concept called "quick take" where possession is given immediately, with the deposit as security. The idea is that the owner can later sue for the actual compensation if the deposit isn't enough.

So, the key point is whether the state can take possession before compensation is finalized. The Fifth Amendment doesn't require payment before condemnation; it just requires just compensation afterward. So, the order by the court allowing possession before full compensation is lawful.

Looking at the options:

Option A says the Fifth Amendment requires payment prior to condemnation. That's incorrect because payment is after, not before. So A is wrong.

Option E says the Fifth Amendment doesn't require payment prior, which aligns with what I was thinking. So E seems correct.

Other options: 

B says the injured party can refuse condemnation under any circumstances. That's not right; refusal isn't possible once the proper process is followed.

C and I talk about delegation of eminent domain to private entities. The question says the corporation is acting under state authority, so delegation might be an issue, but the main point here is about payment timing, not delegation. So perhaps not relevant.

F says power can only be delegated for public use, which might be correct, but the question focuses on the payment process, not whether the delegation is proper.

G and H say the injury isn't a taking. That's probably not the case here because the timber company is being displaced, so it's a taking.

J says only the state can exercise eminent domain. But states can delegate it to private entities for public use, so J is incorrect.

So, the best ground is E, which states that the Fifth Amendment doesn't require payment before condemnation. The order is lawful because the deposit serves as security until the compensation is determined.

The best ground for upholding the state court's order is that the Fifth Amendment's power of eminent domain, as applied through the Fourteenth Amendment, does not require payment before the condemnation of the property. The court-ordered possession prior to compensation is lawful because the deposited sum serves as security for the eventual just compensation.

Answer: E
