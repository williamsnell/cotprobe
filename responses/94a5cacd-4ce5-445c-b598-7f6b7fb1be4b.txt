Okay, so I've got this problem about calculating the effective input source noise power in dBm. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll give it a shot.

Alright, the question says we have a line amplifier with a bandwidth of 22 kHz. The input source resistance is 750 ohms, and the noise temperature is 290 K. Both the input and output impedances are 750 ohms each. We need to find the effective input source noise power in dBm.

Hmm, I remember that noise power can be calculated using the formula related to the thermal noise. Thermal noise is the random fluctuations in voltage or current caused by the resistance and temperature. The formula I think is something like P = k * T * B, where k is Boltzmann's constant, T is the temperature in Kelvin, and B is the bandwidth in Hertz.

Wait, let me get the constants right. Boltzmann's constant k is approximately 1.38 × 10^-23 J/K. The temperature here is 290 K, and the bandwidth B is 22 kHz, which is 22,000 Hz.

So plugging those numbers in: P = 1.38e-23 * 290 * 22000. Let me calculate that.

First, multiply 1.38e-23 by 290. Let's see, 1.38 * 290 is about 399.2. So 399.2e-23. Then multiply by 22,000. 399.2 * 22,000 = let's see, 399.2 * 22 is 8782.4, so 8782.4e-23 * 1000? Wait, no, because 22,000 is 22 * 10^3. So 399.2e-23 * 22e3 = (399.2 * 22) * 1e3 * 1e-23. 399.2 *22 is around 8782.4, so 8782.4e-20, which is 8.7824e-17 watts.

Wait, but that's the noise power in watts. To convert that to dBm, I remember that dBm is 10 times the log base 10 of (power in watts divided by 1 milliwatt). Since 1 milliwatt is 1e-3 watts.

So the formula is: P_dBm = 10 * log10(P_watts / 1e-3) = 10 * log10(P_watts) + 30.

So let's compute P_watts: 8.7824e-17 W.

Taking log10(8.7824e-17) = log10(8.7824) + log10(1e-17) ≈ 0.943 + (-17) = -16.057.

Multiply by 10: 10 * (-16.057) = -160.57, then add 30: -130.57 dBm.

Wait, but wait a second. I think I missed something. Oh right, because the source resistance and the bandwidth are given, but the formula I used is for the noise power across a resistor. Oh right, the formula P = k*T*B is the noise power in a resistor of impedance R. Wait no, actually, the formula is P = k*T*B*R for a resistor R. Or is it P = k*T*B*(R) when R is the source resistance?

Wait, no, wait. Let me get this straight. The root mean square (rms) voltage noise is given by V_n = sqrt(4kTRB), and the noise power is V_n^2 / R. So substituting, V_n^2/R = (4kTRB) * R / R? Wait, that can't be right. Let me think again.

Oh wait, the correct formula for the noise power in a resistor R over bandwidth B is P = (4kTRB)/R. Wait, no, that can't be right because when R is in the denominator, it would be P = (4kTRB)/R? Wait, that would be P = 4kTB.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The noise voltage across a resistor R is V = sqrt(4kTRB). So the power is V^2 / R = (4kTRB) / R = 4kTB. Wait, that can't be right because the R cancels out. That would mean the noise power is 4kTB, regardless of R, which doesn't make sense because higher R should have higher noise power.

Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me look it up in my notes. Oh right, the noise power is given by P = k*T*B*(R), but wait, that would imply higher R gives higher power, which is correct. Alternatively, when you have a resistor R, the noise power is indeed P = k*T*B*R.

Wait, but earlier I used P = k*T*B and got around -130 dBm, but if I include R, it would be P = k*T*B*R. So which is correct?

Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. The formula for the noise power in a resistor R over bandwidth B is P = (4kTRB) / R. Because V = sqrt(4kTRB), so P = V^2/R = (4kTRB)/R = 4kTB. Wait, that can't be right because then R cancels out, which would mean that the noise power depends only on T and B, which doesn't make sense. Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me think again.

Wait, actually, the correct formula is the noise power is P = (k * T * B) * (R), because when you have a resistor R, the noise power is P = k*T*B*R. So I think I forgot to include R earlier.

So, in this problem, R is 750 ohms. So I should calculate P = k*T*B*R.

Let me recalculate that.

k = 1.38e-23 J/K
T = 290 K
B = 22e3 Hz
R = 750 ohms

So P = 1.38e-23 * 290 * 22e3 * 750.

Let me compute that step by step.

First, 1.38e-23 * 290 = 1.38 * 290 = 399.2, so 399.2e-23.

Multiply by 22e3: 399.2e-23 * 22e3 = (399.2 * 22) * 1e-23 * 1e3 = (8782.4) * 1e-20 = 8.7824e-17.

Then multiply by 750: 8.7824e-17 * 750 = let's see, 8.7824 * 750 = 6586.8, so 6586.8e-17 = 6.5868e-14 watts.

Wait, that's 6.5868e-14 W.

Now, to convert to dBm, we use the formula P_dBm = 10 * log10(P / 1e-3) = 10 * log10(6.5868e-14 / 1e-3) = 10 * log10(6.5868e-11).

Compute log10(6.5868e-11). log10(6.5868) is about 0.818, and log10(1e-11) is -11. So total is 0.818 -11 = -10.182.

Multiply by 10: -101.82 dBm. Wait, but that's not matching any of the options. Hmm, that can't be right because the options are all around -120 to -135 dBm.

Wait, I must have messed up somewhere. Let me check my calculations again.

Wait, perhaps the formula is P = k*T*B. Without the R, because the source resistance is part of the system. Wait, but I'm getting conflicting info. Let me double-check.

Wait, another approach: The effective noise power in a resistor R is given by P = k*T*B*(R). So the formula is correct. So let's recalculate.

Wait, let me compute 1.38e-23 * 290 = 399.2e-23 = 3.992e-21.

Multiply by 22e3: 3.992e-21 * 22e3 = 3.992 *22 = 87.824, so 87.824e-18 = 8.7824e-17.

Then multiply by 750: 8.7824e-17 *750 = let's compute 8.7824 * 750 = 6586.8, so 6586.8e-17 = 6.5868e-14 W.

Wait, same as before. So converting 6.5868e-14 W to dBm.

6.5868e-14 W is equal to 6.5868e-14 / 1e-3 = 6.5868e-11 W.

log10(6.5868e-11) = log10(6.5868) + log10(1e-11) ≈ 0.818 + (-11) = -10.182.

10 * (-10.182) = -101.82 dBm. Hmm, that's not matching any of the options. The options are more around -120 to -135. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I'm supposed to consider the input impedance and the output impedance, but since both are 750 ohms, maybe it's a matched system, so the noise is referred to the source.

Wait, another thought: Maybe I should use the formula for noise power without considering the source resistance. Because the formula P = k*T*B is for the noise power in a resistor, but in this case, the source resistance is 750 ohms, so perhaps the noise power is P = (k*T*B) * R, which is what I did.

Wait, but I'm getting -101 dBm, which isn't an option. Let me check the options again.

Options are from about -115 to -135 dBm. So my calculation is way off. I must have a mistake in the formula.

Wait, maybe the correct formula is P = (k*T*B) * (R), but perhaps I should calculate it differently. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is P = (k*T) * (B) * (R) / (some factor). Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: The noise voltage across a resistor R is Vn = sqrt(4kTRB). The power is Vn^2 / R, which is (4kTRB) * R / R = 4kTB. Wait, that can't be right because that would make it 4kTB, independent of R. That's not correct because higher R should have higher noise power. So I think this approach is wrong.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is P = (k*T*B)*R. So let's recalculate with that.

k = 1.38e-23
T = 290
B = 22e3
R = 750

P = 1.38e-23 * 290 * 22e3 * 750.

Compute step by step:

1.38e-23 * 290 = 1.38 * 290 = 399.2 → 399.2e-23 = 3.992e-21.

Multiply by 22e3: 3.992e-21 * 22e3 = 3.992 *22 = 87.824 → 87.824e-18 = 8.7824e-17.

Multiply by 750: 8.7824e-17 * 750 = 6.5868e-14 W.

So same result as before. Still -101 dBm. Not matching.

Wait, maybe I'm using the wrong formula. Let me check another approach. The noise power in dBm can be calculated using the formula:

P_dBm = 10 * log10( (k * T * B) * R ) + 10 * log10( (4 * 10^-23) / 1e-3 )

Wait, no, that's getting confusing. Let me think again.

Wait, another way: The thermal noise in a resistor R over bandwidth B is P = (k*T*B) * R. So P = 1.38e-23 * 290 * 22e3 * 750.

Wait, let me compute this again.

1.38e-23 * 290 = 399.2e-23 = 3.992e-21.

3.992e-21 * 22e3 = 3.992e-21 * 2.2e4 = (3.992 * 2.2) * 1e-21 * 1e4 = 8.7824 * 1e-17 = 8.7824e-17.

8.7824e-17 * 750 = 6.5868e-14 W.

So same as before. Now, converting to dBm:

P = 6.5868e-14 W.

dBm = 10 * log10(6.5868e-14 / 1e-3) = 10 * log10(6.5868e-11).

log10(6.5868e-11) = log10(6.5868) + log10(1e-11) ≈ 0.818 + (-11) = -10.182.

So dBm = 10 * (-10.182) = -101.82 dBm. Still not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the formula. Let me try using the formula without R. So P = k*T*B.

So P = 1.38e-23 * 290 * 22e3.

Compute that:

1.38e-23 * 290 = 399.2e-23 = 3.992e-21.

3.992e-21 * 22e3 = 8.7824e-17 W.

Now, convert to dBm: 8.7824e-17 W is 8.7824e-17 / 1e-3 = 8.7824e-14 mW.

Wait, no, wait. To convert watts to dBm, you do 10 * log10(P / 1e-3), where P is in watts.

So P = 8.7824e-17 W.

P / 1e-3 = 8.7824e-14.

log10(8.7824e-14) = log10(8.7824) + log10(1e-14) ≈ 0.943 + (-14) = -13.057.

10 * (-13.057) = -130.57 dBm. Ah, that's one of the options, option F is -130.22, and option D is -124.53, etc.

Wait, but why did I get a different result when including R? Because in the first approach I included R, but now I'm not. So which is correct?

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is P = k*T*B, but since the source resistance is given, I should include it. But that's where I got the -101 dBm, which doesn't match any options. Alternatively, maybe the formula is P = (k*T*B) * R, but that's what I did earlier and it didn't match.

Wait, perhaps the confusion is about whether the formula uses R or not. Let me think again. The noise power in a resistor R is P = (k*T*B) * R. But in this case, the source resistance is 750 ohms, and the input impedance is also 750, so it's matched. Therefore, the noise power would be P = (k*T*B) * R.

But earlier, when I included R, I got -101 dBm, which is not an option. Without R, I get -130.57 dBm, which is option F (-130.22) is close. But none of the options exactly match.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation without R. Let me recheck.

P = 1.38e-23 * 290 * 22e3.

1.38e-23 * 290 = 399.2e-23 = 3.992e-21.

3.992e-21 * 22e3 = 3.992e-21 * 2.2e4 = (3.992 * 2.2) * 1e-21+4 = 8.7824 * 1e-17 = 8.7824e-17 W.

Now, to dBm: 10 * log10(8.7824e-17 / 1e-3) = 10 * log10(8.7824e-14).

log10(8.7824e-14) = log10(8.7824) + log10(1e-14) ≈ 0.943 + (-14) = -13.057.

So dBm = 10 * (-13.057) = -130.57 dBm. Hmm, option F is -130.22, which is close but not exact.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use a more precise value for k. Let me try using k = 1.380648523e-23 J/K.

So recalculating:

k*T*B = 1.380648523e-23 * 290 * 22e3.

1.380648523e-23 * 290 = let's compute 1.380648523 * 290 = approximately 399.843.

So 399.843e-23 = 3.99843e-21.

Multiply by 22e3: 3.99843e-21 * 22e3 = 3.99843 * 22 = 87.96546 → 87.96546e-18 = 8.796546e-17 W.

Now, 8.796546e-17 W to dBm: 10 * log10(8.796546e-17 / 1e-3) = 10 * log10(8.796546e-14).

log10(8.796546e-14) = log10(8.796546) + log10(1e-14) ≈ 0.944 + (-14) = -13.056.

So dBm = 10 * (-13.056) = -130.56 dBm.

Looking at the options, F is -130.22, which is close but not exact. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the formula includes the noise factor or something else, but the question doesn't mention any noise factor, so I think it's just thermal noise.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the question is asking for the effective noise power without including the source resistance, just using the formula P = k*T*B. Let me try that.

So P = 1.38e-23 * 290 * 22e3 = 8.7824e-17 W.

Convert to dBm: 10 * log10(8.7824e-17 / 1e-3) = 10 * log10(8.7824e-14) ≈ 10 * (-13.057) = -130.57 dBm.

Which matches closely with option F (-130.22), but it's a bit off. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to use the noise power formula with R, but I must have made a mistake in the calculation earlier.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the calculation with R included.

P = k*T*B*R = 1.38e-23 * 290 * 22e3 * 750.

Let me compute this step by step:

1.38e-23 * 290 = 399.2e-23 = 3.992e-21.

3.992e-21 * 22e3 = 3.992e-21 * 2.2e4 = (3.992 * 2.2) = 8.7824 → 8.7824e-17.

8.7824e-17 * 750 = 6.5868e-14 W.

Now, 6.5868e-14 W to dBm: 10 * log10(6.5868e-14 / 1e-3) = 10 * log10(6.5868e-11).

log10(6.5868e-11) = log10(6.5868) ≈ 0.818, so 0.818 -11 = -10.182.

10 * (-10.182) = -101.82 dBm. Still not matching any options.

Wait, this is confusing. Maybe the correct approach is to use P = (k*T*B). So the answer is about -130.57 dBm, which is close to option F (-130.22). But let me check the options again.

Looking at the options, the closest is F: -130.22 dbm. But wait, another thought: Perhaps the formula is P = (k*T*B) * R and then converted to dBm correctly.

Wait, let me try that again with precise numbers.

Compute P = 1.380648523e-23 * 290 * 22000 * 750.

First, compute 1.380648523e-23 * 290 = 1.380648523 * 290 = 399.843 (approx).

399.843e-23 = 3.99843e-21.

Multiply by 22000: 3.99843e-21 * 2.2e4 = 3.99843 *2.2 = 8.796546 → 8.796546e-17.

Multiply by 750: 8.796546e-17 *750 = 6.5974095e-14 W.

Now, to dBm: 10 * log10(6.5974095e-14 / 1e-3) = 10 * log10(6.5974095e-11).

log10(6.5974095e-11) = log10(6.5974) ≈ 0.818, so 0.818 -11 = -10.182.

10 * (-10.182) = -101.82 dBm. Still same result.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct approach is without including R, giving -130.57 dBm, which is close to option F (-130.22). Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is P = (k*T*B) without R, which would give around -130.57 dBm.

Looking at the options, option F is -130.22, which is close but not exact. Alternatively, perhaps I made a calculation error earlier.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula P = (k*T*B) and then convert to dBm accurately.

Let me compute 1.38e-23 * 290 * 22000.

Compute step by step:

1.38e-23 * 290 = 399.2e-23 = 3.992e-21.

3.992e-21 * 22000 = 3.992e-21 * 2.2e4 = (3.992 * 2.2) = 8.7824 → 8.7824e-17 W.

Now, dBm = 10 * log10(8.7824e-17 / 1e-3) = 10 * log10(8.7824e-14).

Compute log10(8.7824e-14):

log10(8.7824) ≈ 0.943.

So log10(8.7824e-14) = 0.943 -14 = -13.057.

10 * (-13.057) = -130.57 dBm.

So the answer is approximately -130.57 dBm, which is closest to option F: -130.22 dBm. But looking at the options, option D is -124.53 dBm, which is quite a bit lower. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the line amplifier has a certain gain, but the question doesn't mention gain, so I don't think that's the case. The question is only about the effective input source noise power, so it's just the noise at the input.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses the noise figure or the effective noise temperature, but the question doesn't provide any noise figure, so I think it's just thermal noise.

Wait, another approach: The effective noise power can also be expressed using the formula P = ( (k*T*B) ) in dBm, which is what I did earlier, giving -130.57 dBm.

But let me check the options again. The options are:

A: -122.81
B: -132.45
C: -120.75
D: -124.53
E: -118.99
F: -130.22
G: -126.38
H: -134.57
I: -115.67
J: -128.67

So the closest is F: -130.22, which is very close to my calculated -130.57. The difference is about 0.35 dBm, which could be due to more precise constants or rounding during calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is P = (k*T*B) * R, but that gave me -101 dBm, which isn't an option. So I'm more confident that the correct approach is to use P = k*T*B, giving around -130.57 dBm, which is option F: -130.22.

Wait, but wait another moment. The input source resistance is 750 ohms, so perhaps the noise power should be calculated as P = (k*T*B) * R. But then I get -101 dBm, which isn't an option. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is P = (k*T*B) * R, but then converting that power into dBm requires considering the source resistance. Wait, I'm getting stuck here.

Let me try to see if any of the options match when I use P = (k*T*B) * R.

Earlier, I got 6.5868e-14 W, which is -101.82 dBm. But none of the options are close to that. So perhaps I made a mistake in including R. Maybe the correct formula is P = (k*T*B) without R, giving -130.57 dBm, which is option F.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the effective noise power as the noise across the source resistance, which would be P = (k*T*B) * R, but that doesn't match any options.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the units. Let me double-check the conversion from watts to dBm.

Power in dBm = 10 * log10(P / 1e-3), where P is in watts.

So for P = 8.7824e-17 W,

P / 1e-3 = 8.7824e-14 W.

log10(8.7824e-14) = log10(8.7824) + log10(1e-14) = 0.943 -14 = -13.057.

10 * (-13.057) = -130.57 dBm.

Yes, that's correct. So I think the correct answer is approximately -130.57 dBm, which is closest to option F: -130.22 dBm. Alternatively, perhaps the exact calculation with precise constants would give exactly -130.22 dBm.

Wait, perhaps I should use more precise values for k and recompute.

k = 1.380648523e-23 J/K

So P = 1.380648523e-23 * 290 * 22000.

Let me compute this precisely:

1.380648523e-23 * 290 = 1.380648523 * 290 = let's compute that.

1.380648523 * 290 = 1.380648523 * 200 = 276.1297046
Plus 1.380648523 * 90 = 124.2583671
Total = 276.1297046 + 124.2583671 = 400.3880717 → 400.3880717e-23 = 4.003880717e-21.

Multiply by 22000: 4.003880717e-21 * 22000 = 4.003880717e-21 * 2.2e4 = (4.003880717 * 2.2) * 1e-21+4 = 8.808537577 * 1e-17 = 8.808537577e-17 W.

Now, to dBm: 10 * log10(8.808537577e-17 / 1e-3) = 10 * log10(8.808537577e-14).

log10(8.808537577e-14) = log10(8.808537577) + log10(1e-14).

log10(8.808537577) ≈ 0.9447.

So 0.9447 -14 = -13.0553.

10 * (-13.0553) = -130.553 dBm.

Which is approximately -130.55 dBm. The option F is -130.22, which is close but not exact. Alternatively, perhaps the exact calculation gives a value closer to -130.55, but since the options don't have that, the closest is F.

Alternatively, perhaps the intended answer is option D: -124.53, but that doesn't make sense because without R, it's -130.55.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the noise power is referred to the output, but the question says input source noise power. So I think the correct approach is to use P = k*T*B, giving -130.55 dBm, which is closest to option F: -130.22 dBm.

So I think the correct answer is F.

To determine the effective input source noise power in dBm, we use the formula for thermal noise power in a resistor:

\[
P = k \cdot T \cdot B
\]

Where:
- \( k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \) (Boltzmann's constant),
- \( T = 290 \, \text{K} \) (noise temperature),
- \( B = 22 \, \text{kHz} = 22,000 \, \text{Hz} \) (bandwidth).

### Step 1: Calculate the noise power in watts
\[
P = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \cdot 290 \cdot 22,000
\]

1. Compute \( 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \cdot 290 \):
   \[
   1.38 \cdot 290 = 399.2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 399.2 \times 10^{-23} = 3.992 \times 10^{-21}
   \]

2. Multiply by \( 22,000 \):
   \[
   3.992 \times 10^{-21} \cdot 22,000 = 8.7824 \times 10^{-17} \, \text{W}
   \]

### Step 2: Convert power to dBm
The formula to convert power \( P \) (in watts) to dBm is:
\[
P_{\text{dBm}} = 10 \cdot \log_{10}\left(\frac{P}{1 \, \text{mW}}\right)
\]

Since \( 1 \, \text{mW} = 10^{-3} \, \text{W} \):
\[
P_{\text{dBm}} = 10 \cdot \log_{10}\left(\frac{8.7824 \times 10^{-17}}{10^{-3}}\right) = 10 \cdot \log_{10}(8.7824 \times 10^{-14})
\]

3. Compute \( \log_{10}(8.7824 \times 10^{-14}) \):
   \[
   \log_{10}(8.7824) \approx 0.943, \quad \log_{10}(10^{-14}) = -14
   \]
   \[
   \log_{10}(8.7824 \times 10^{-14}) = 0.943 - 14 = -13.057
   \]

4. Multiply by 10:
   \[
   P_{\text{dBm}} = 10 \cdot (-13.057) = -130.57 \, \text{dBm}
   \]

### Step 3: Match with the closest option
The calculated value of \( -130.57 \, \text{dBm} \) is closest to option **F: -130.22 dBm**.
