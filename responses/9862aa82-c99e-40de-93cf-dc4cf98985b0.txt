Okay, so I've got this question about the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, and I need to figure out what Article III resulted in. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk was signed on March 14, 1918, between Germany, Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria, and Turkey on one side, and Russia on the other. It was a peace treaty that ended Russia's involvement in World War I. So, Russia left the war, and the other countries got some territorial concessions.

Looking at Article I, it says that the state of war between the parties has ceased, and they're committed to living in peace. That makes sense because Russia was exhausted from the war and the revolution, so they wanted out.

Now, focusing on Article III: It mentions territories west of a certain line that used to belong to Russia. These territories will no longer be under Russian sovereignty. The line is on a map that's part of the treaty, and a Russo-German commission will fix the exact boundaries.

So, the key here is understanding what this line represents. I think this line is the demarcation that Germany and Russia agreed upon. The territories west of this line were part of Russia before but now would be transferred. Since Russia was giving up these territories, it's a surrender of some of its land.

Wait, but the options are about who surrendered to whom. The question is about the result of Article III. So, the territories are no longer Russian, meaning they're being taken over by the other side. Since the other side includes Germany, I think Russia is surrendering these territories to Germany or its allies.

Looking at the options, let's go through them:

A: Surrender of eastern part of Austrian Empire to Russia. No, because Russia is giving up, not receiving.

B: Surrender of Bulgaria to Russia. Doesn't fit because the article talks about Russia losing territories.

C: Surrender of western part of German Empire to Russia. No, because Russia is the one losing territories.

D: Neutral zone between Germany and Russia. The article doesn't mention a neutral zone, just the line.

E: Surrender of Austria-Hungary to Russia. Again, Russia is giving up, not receiving.

F: Surrender of eastern part of German Empire to Russia. Hmm, not sure. Wait, the line is in the west, so perhaps it's about the east.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. The territories west of the line that were Russian are now not Russian. So, these territories would go to the other side, which includes Germany and Austria-Hungary. So, the areas west of the line would be ceded to Germany.

Wait, the article says the territories west of the line, which were Russian, are no longer under Russian sovereignty. So, they're being transferred to the other side. The other side includes Germany, so Russia is losing these western territories to Germany or its allies.

Wait, but the options are about who is surrendering. The question is about the result of Article III. So, the territories are being transferred from Russia to the others. So, it's Russia surrendering those territories.

Looking at the options again:

J: Surrender of the western part of the Russian Empire to the German Empire. That sounds right because the territories west of the line (which is an eastern boundary) would be the western part of Russia. So, Russia is surrendering its western territories to Germany.

Wait, but the line is agreed upon by the contracting parties, which are the Central Powers (Germany, Austria-Hungary, etc.) and Russia. So, the line defines the new border, and west of that line, the territories are no longer Russian. So, those territories are now under German control.

So, the result is that Russia surrenders its western territories to Germany. So, the correct option is J.

Wait, but let me double-check. The line is on a map, and the territories west of it are no longer Russian. So, those territories are given to the other side, which is Germany and its allies. So, yes, J seems correct: the western part of the Russian Empire is surrendered to the German Empire.

The Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, signed in 1918, ended Russia's involvement in World War I and resulted in territorial concessions. Article III specifies that territories west of a defined line, previously under Russian sovereignty, would no longer be Russian. These territories were ceded to the Central Powers, including Germany. Therefore, the result of Article III was the surrender of the western part of the Russian Empire to the German Empire.

Answer: J
