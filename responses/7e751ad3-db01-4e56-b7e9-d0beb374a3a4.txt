Alright, so I need to figure out this economics problem about a monopolist's profits with and without price discrimination. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem gives a table with quantities and corresponding prices:

Quantity | Price
1        | 109
2        | 105
3        | 100
4        | 96
5        | 91

It also mentions that the total costs at the optimal output of 5 units are $405. The question has two parts: a) profit without price discrimination, and b) profit with price discrimination. The options are labeled from A to J, each giving two numbers representing the profits for a) and b) respectively.

First, I'll tackle part a), profit without price discrimination. Since it's a monopoly without price discrimination, the monopolist will sell all units at a single price, which is typically the highest price they can charge without losing all customers. But wait, in monopolies without price discrimination, they set a single price where marginal revenue equals marginal cost. Alternatively, sometimes it's easier to think in terms of total revenue and total cost.

Wait, the question says the optimal output is 5 units. So the monopolist is selling 5 units. But without price discrimination, they have to set a single price for all units. So which price will that be? Let me think. Monopolists maximize profit by choosing the quantity where marginal revenue equals marginal cost. But since we don't have marginal costs, maybe we can assume that the total cost is given at 5 units, which is $405. So total cost is fixed at 5 units as $405.

Wait, actually, the problem states that total costs at the optimal output of 5 units are $405. So that's fixed. So for part a), without price discrimination, the monopolist will set a price based on the quantity sold. Since they're selling 5 units, what price do they charge? Usually, in such cases, the price is determined by the demand curve at that quantity. Looking at the table, when quantity is 5, the price is $91. So without price discrimination, they would charge $91 for all 5 units.

Wait, but wait a second. No, that's not right. Because if they charge $91 for all 5 units, that's the same price per unit. Alternatively, perhaps they could charge a higher price if they can, but without price discrimination, they can't sell different units at different prices. Wait, noâ€”if they set a higher price, they might sell fewer units. So the optimal price is where the quantity sold is 5, so the price is $91 per unit. So total revenue would be 5 * 91 = 455.

Total cost is given as 405. So profit is total revenue minus total cost, which is 455 - 405 = $50. So for part a), the profit is $50.

Wait, but looking at the options, the first number is a) and the second is b). So let's check the options where a) is $50. Looking at the options, option D is $50 and $96. But let's confirm.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Because without price discrimination, the monopolist can't set a higher price for more units. So if they sell 5 units, they have to set the price at the maximum they can get for 5 units, which is $91 each. So total revenue is 5*91=455, and total cost is 405, so profit is 455-405=50. So a) is $50.

Now for part b), with price discrimination. Monopolists with price discrimination can charge different prices to different customers, essentially capturing all the consumer surplus. So they can sell each unit at the highest possible price that each quantity can bear. That means they would charge the highest price for the first unit, next highest for the second, etc.

So let's calculate total revenue with price discrimination. They would sell 1 unit at $109, 2nd at $105, 3rd at $100, 4th at $96, and 5th at $91. So total revenue is 109 + 105 + 100 + 96 +91.

Let me add them up:

109 + 105 = 214

214 +100=314

314 +96=410

410 +91=501

So total revenue with price discrimination is $501. Total cost is still 405, so profit is 501 -405=96.

So part b) is $96. So looking back, the options are:

Option D: $50 and $96. So that's the answer.

Wait, but wait another thing. Did I make a mistake in part a)? Because sometimes in monopolies without price discrimination, the price is set at the marginal revenue point, which might not be the same as the price at the 5th unit.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of MR and MC. Let me try that approach.

To find the profit without price discrimination, the monopolist maximizes profit by setting MR=MC. But since we don't have MC data, but we know the optimal output is 5 units, so the price would be such that the marginal revenue of the 5th unit is equal to marginal cost.

Wait, but perhaps the total revenue at 5 units is 5*91=455, and total cost is 405, so profit is 50 as before.

Alternatively, perhaps the price without discrimination is the price at which they sell 5 units, which is $91, leading to the same calculation.

So yes, part a) is 50, part b) is 96. So the correct option is D.
</think>

The monopolist's profit without price discrimination is calculated by selling 5 units at the price of $91 each, resulting in total revenue of $455 and profit of $50. With price discrimination, the monopolist maximizes profit by charging different prices for each unit, leading to total revenue of $501 and profit of $96.
