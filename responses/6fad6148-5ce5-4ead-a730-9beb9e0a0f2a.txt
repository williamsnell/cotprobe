Okay, so I've got this question about medicalization, and I need to figure out the correct answer. I'm a bit rusty on this concept, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that medicalization is a term used in social sciences, particularly sociology. It has to do with how certain issues are framed within a medical context. I think it's when something that isn't traditionally seen as a medical problem starts being treated as one. But wait, I'm not entirely sure.

Looking at the options, let's go through them one by one.

Option A says medicalization is when a health issue is treated as an economic problem. Hmm, that doesn't sound right. Medicalization is more about the medical framing, not economic. Plus, treating health as economic would be more like cost-benefit analysis or something, not medicalization.

Option B states that medicalization occurs when social issues are increasingly seen as medical problems. That rings a bell. I think this is about how society starts using medical terms and approaches to explain social issues, like how drug use or mental health are often medicalized. So maybe B is correct.

Option C says an issue is medicalized when it's dismissed as a security threat and seen as a health issue. That doesn't quite fit. I think medicalization is more about expanding the medical scope rather than replacing security with health. Also, the idea of mutually exclusive domains might not be the main point here.

Option D claims medicalization is when an issue is no longer a health concern but a cultural or societal matter. Wait, that seems like the opposite. If something is medicalized, it's seen as a health issue, not dismissed as cultural. So D might be incorrect.

Option E says medicalization is the outcome of security dialogues using medical language. I'm not sure about this. I don't recall medicalization being specifically tied to national security discussions. It's more general than that.

Option F refers to when a medical issue becomes a legal one. That sounds more like legalization or pathologization, not medicalization. So probably not F.

Option G states that medicalization is when a social or cultural issue becomes a security issue. No, that's the opposite of what medicalization is. It's about making something medical, not about security.

Option H says medicalization is when a medical issue becomes securitized. Again, that's the opposite. Securitization is a different concept where issues are framed as threats to security, not the other way around.

Option I mentions shifting from security to education. That doesn't fit with what I know about medicalization, which is more about expanding into the medical realm rather than moving to education.

Option J refers to interpreting political issues as medical. That could be part of medicalization, but I think the broader concept is more about how various aspects of life are framed through a medical lens, not just politics.

So, going back to Option B: when social issues are increasingly considered as medical problems. That sounds correct because medicalization often involves taking social or personal behaviors and framing them as medical conditions. For example, things like childbirth, menopause, or even something like shyness have been medicalized over time.

Wait, but I should double-check. I think the term medicalization is sometimes used to describe how society's view of health expands to include more aspects of life, turning them into medical issues. So yes, that aligns with Option B.

I think I'm confident enough that B is the correct answer.

The process of 'medicalization' best describes how social issues are increasingly viewed and addressed as medical problems. This involves framing various aspects of life, such as behaviors or conditions, within a medical context, even when they are not traditionally considered health issues. 

Answer: B
