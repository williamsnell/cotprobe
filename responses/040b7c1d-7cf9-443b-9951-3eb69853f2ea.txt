Okay, so I have this economics question about a private closed economy, and I need to figure out which statement is true. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I remember that in a private closed economy, there are no government or foreign sectors. So, the only players are households and firms. The main concepts here are consumption, savings, investment, and equilibrium.

Looking at the options, I need to recall what each of these terms means in this context. Let's go through each option one by one.

Option A: Investment is always less than savings. Hmm, I'm not sure. I think in equilibrium, investment equals savings because firms invest based on savings. But does that mean investment is always less? Maybe not. So A could be false.

Option B: Saving is equal to zero when consumption equals disposable income. Wait, disposable income is Yd, right? If consumption (C) equals Yd, then saving (S) would be Yd - C, which is zero. So yes, that makes sense. So B might be true.

Option C: Investment is always greater than savings. That doesn't sound right. Investment equals savings in equilibrium, so C is probably false.

Option D: Saving is equal to zero when consumption exceeds disposable income. No, if consumption exceeds Yd, then S = Yd - C would be negative. So D is false because saving can't be negative unless there's borrowing, which I'm not sure about in this model.

Option E: The economy is in equilibrium when consumption equals saving. Wait, equilibrium is when total output equals total expenditure. In a closed economy without government, Y = C + I. Savings (S) equals investment (I). So equilibrium is when I = S, not necessarily when C = S. So E is false.

Option F: The economy is in equilibrium when consumption exceeds saving. That would mean C > S, but equilibrium is when I = S, so F is incorrect.

Option G: Household saving can occasionally be negative. I think in some models, households can have negative savings, meaning they're borrowing. So G could be true.

Option H: Household saving is always equal to investment. No, because in equilibrium, saving equals investment, but not always. For example, if the economy isn't in equilibrium, saving might not equal investment. So H is false.

Option I: The economy is in equilibrium when investment equals saving. Yes, because I = S in equilibrium. So I is true.

Option J: Household saving can never be negative. No, because if households spend more than their income, they have to borrow, so saving is negative. So J is false.

Wait, so both B and I are looking correct. Let me think again. The question is asking which statement is true.

Option B says saving is zero when C=Yd. That's correct because S = Yd - C. So when C=Yd, S=0. So B is true.

Option I says equilibrium when I=S. Yes, that's correct. So both B and I are correct? But looking at the options, I can only choose one.

Wait, the question is which statement is true. So both B and I are correct? Or am I missing something?

Wait, the question says "which of the following statements is true." So maybe both B and I are true. But looking at the options, I need to pick only one.

Wait, no, in a private closed economy, equilibrium is when Y = C + I, and since S = I, it's when I = S. So I is correct. Also, when C=Yd, S=0, so B is correct.

Wait, but the options are A to J, and I need to pick the correct one. So maybe both B and I are correct. But looking back, the options are single letters. So perhaps the correct answers are B and I.

But let me check the options again. The options are A to J, each a separate statement.

Wait, the options are:

A: Investment < Savings
B: Saving=0 when C=Yd
C: Investment > Savings
D: Saving=0 when C>Yd
E: Equilibrium when C=S
F: Equilibrium when C>S
G: Household saving can be negative
H: Saving=Investment always
I: Equilibrium when I=S
J: Saving can't be negative

So in a private closed economy, equilibrium is when I=S, so I is correct. Also, B is correct because when C=Yd, S=0.

But the options are separate, so perhaps both B and I are correct. But looking at the options, the correct answers are B and I. Wait, but the user is asking to select the correct option, so maybe only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps the question allows multiple correct answers, but looking at the options, each is a separate option. So perhaps the correct answers are B and I.

But the way the question is phrased, "which of the following statements is true," it might have multiple correct answers, but in the given options, perhaps only I is correct.

Wait, no, because in a private closed economy, the equilibrium condition is Y = C + I, and since Y = C + S (Household's Yd = C + S), so S = I. So equilibrium is when I=S, so I is correct.

Also, when C=Yd, S=0, so B is correct.

So both B and I are correct. But looking at the options, perhaps the answer is both B and I. But the options don't have E.g., both B and I as an option. So perhaps the question expects multiple corrects, but the way it's given, I have to choose the correct ones.

Wait, perhaps only I is correct because the equilibrium condition is when I=S. B is correct as a fact, but perhaps in the context of equilibrium, it's when I=S.

Wait, the question is asking which statement is true in a private closed economy, regardless of equilibrium. So both B and I are correct.

But looking back, the options are given as separate, and perhaps the correct answers are both B and I. But the way the options are presented, each is a separate statement. So perhaps the correct answers are B and I, but the user is expecting only one. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again.

In a private closed economy:

- Savings (S) = Yd - C
- Investment (I) is determined by savings.

Equilibrium is when I = S.

So statement I is correct.

Also, when C = Yd, then S = Yd - C = 0. So statement B is correct.

So both B and I are correct. But looking at the options, perhaps the correct answer is both B and I. However, the options are separate, so perhaps the question expects multiple correct answers, but the way the options are given, I need to choose all that apply. But in this case, the user is asking to select from A to J, so perhaps the correct options are B and I.

Wait, but the options are A to J, each a separate statement, so the correct answer would be both B and I. But in the given options, perhaps only I is correct because it's about equilibrium. Or perhaps both are correct.

Wait, perhaps I should check the possible answers. Let me think about each option again.

Option B: Saving is zero when C=Yd. Correct.

Option I: Equilibrium when I=S. Correct.

So both B and I are correct. But looking at the options, perhaps the answer includes both. But the way the question is presented, it's a multiple-choice with options A to J, and you have to pick one letter. So perhaps the correct answer is both B and I, but that's not possible in this setup. Maybe the question expects only one correct answer, but I think both are correct.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me look again.

The question is: In a private closed economy, which statement is true?

So the correct statements are:

B: Correct because S=0 when C=Yd.

I: Correct because equilibrium is when I=S.

G: Correct because household saving can be negative (dis-saving).

J: Incorrect because saving can be negative.

So the possible correct options are B, G, and I.

Wait, but let me think about G. In a private closed economy, can household saving be negative?

Household saving is S = Yd - C. If C > Yd, then S is negative, meaning the household is borrowing. So yes, G is correct.

So now I'm confused because multiple options seem correct. But the question is a multiple-choice with options A to J, each a separate statement.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is I, because it's about equilibrium, which is a key concept.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answers are B, G, and I.

But the way the options are given, perhaps the intended correct answer is I.

Wait, but the user's options are A to J, each a separate statement, and the question is which is true.

So perhaps the correct answers are B, G, and I. But looking back, the options are:

A: Investment < Savings.

B: Saving=0 when C=Yd.

C: Investment > Savings.

D: Saving=0 when C>Yd.

E: Equilibrium when C=S.

F: Equilibrium when C>S.

G: Household saving can be negative.

H: Saving=Investment always.

I: Equilibrium when I=S.

J: Saving can't be negative.

So, the correct statements are B, G, and I.

But the question is asking which statement is true, implying only one. But perhaps in the options, the correct answers are B, G, and I.

But the way the question is phrased, it's a single correct answer. So perhaps the intended correct answer is I.

Alternatively, perhaps the user is to select all that apply, but the way it's presented, I think I should choose I as the correct answer because it's about equilibrium, which is a key point.

Wait, but the user's options include I as correct, and B and G as correct as well. So perhaps the correct answers are B, G, and I.

But the way the options are given, each is a separate option, so perhaps the correct answer is both B and I, but since I can only choose one, perhaps the intended answer is I.

Wait, perhaps the question is from a textbook where the correct answer is I. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is B and I.

But in the given options, perhaps the correct answer is I.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think differently.

In a private closed economy, equilibrium occurs when planned investment equals planned saving. So I is correct.

Also, when C = Yd, S = 0, so B is correct.

Additionally, household saving can be negative (G is correct), so J is wrong.

So the correct options are B, G, and I.

But the question is presented as a multiple-choice with options A to J, and you have to select one letter. So perhaps the correct answer is I.

But the user's options include both B and I as correct. So perhaps the correct answer includes both, but since I can only choose one, perhaps the intended answer is I.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking which statement is true, and more than one could be correct, but the options don't allow that. So perhaps the correct answer is I.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is both B and I, but since the user's options are separate, perhaps the intended answer is I.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the most correct answer. The equilibrium condition is when I=S, so I is definitely correct. B is also correct as a fact, but perhaps the question is focusing on equilibrium, so I is the correct answer.

So, after considering all this, I think the correct answer is I.
</think>

The correct answer is I. 

In a private closed economy, the equilibrium condition is when investment equals savings. This is because, in equilibrium, total output equals total expenditure, and since savings (by households) must equal investment (by firms), the economy is in balance when these two are equal. 

Option I directly states this equilibrium condition, making it the correct choice.

I
