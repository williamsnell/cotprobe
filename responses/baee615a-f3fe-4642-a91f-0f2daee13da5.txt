Answer:
    
<think>
Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question with three parts, a, b, and c, each having two sub-questions. I'll need to figure out the correct answers for each part and then match them to the options provided (A to J). Let's take it step by step.

Starting with part a:

a) The velocity profile is given by u = u_m [1 - (b²/B²)]. I need to find the average velocity in terms of u_m and the momentum correction factor β.

First, the average velocity (V_avg) is calculated by integrating the velocity profile over the cross-sectional area and dividing by that area. The formula for V_avg is:

V_avg = (1/A) ∫ u dA

For a parallel plate flow between two plates separated by 2B (so half-spacing is B), the cross-sectional area is 2B times the width, but since the width is constant, it will cancel out. Let's set up the integral.

u = u_m [1 - (b²/B²)]

Since b is the distance from the center, b ranges from -B to B. But because the function is symmetric, we can integrate from 0 to B and double it.

So,

V_avg = (1/(2B)) ∫ from -B to B of u_m [1 - (b²/B²)] db

This simplifies to (u_m/(2B)) * ∫ from -B to B [1 - (b²/B²)] db

Breaking the integral into two parts:

∫ [1] db from -B to B = 2B

∫ (b²/B²) db from -B to B = (1/B²) * [b³/3] from -B to B = (1/B²) * ( (B³/3) - (-B)³/3 ) = (1/B²)( (B³/3) + B³/3 ) = (1/B²)(2B³/3) )= 2B/3

So the integral becomes:

(2B) - (2B/3) = (6B/3 - 2B/3) = 4B/3

Then V_avg = (u_m/(2B)) * (4B/3) ) = (u_m/(2B)) * (4B/3) )= (4 u_m)/(6) = (2/3) u_m.

Wait, that doesn't match any of the options for part a. Let me check my calculations again.

Wait, another approach: the velocity profile is u = u_m (1 - (b²/B²)). The average velocity would be the integral over the area divided by the area.

The area is 2B * width (but width cancels). The integral over b from -B to B of u db is:

∫ u db = ∫ from -B to B u_m (1 - (b²/B²)) db.

This is u_m [ ∫1 db - ∫ (b²/B²) db ]

= u_m [ (2B) - (1/B²)(b³/3) evaluated from -B to B ]

= u_m [ 2B - (1/B²)( (B³/3) - (-B³/3) ) ]

= u_m [ 2B - (1/B²)( 2B³/3 ) ]

= u_m [ 2B - (2B/3) ]

= u_m [ (6B/3 - 2B/3) ] = u_m (4B/3)

Then average velocity = (4B/3) / (2B) )= (4B/3) * (1/(2B)) )= (4)/(6) u_m = (2/3) u_m.

Wait, but looking at the options, none of the part a answers match (2/3) u_m. Let me check the options again. Option E says (a) Average velocity = (2/3) u_m, beta = 1.20. So E's part a is correct.

Now, the momentum correction factor β is given by β = (ρ ∫ u² dA ) / (ρ A (V_avg)^2 ) ) = ( ∫ u² dA ) / ( A (V_avg)^2 )

So, compute ∫ u² db from -B to B.

u² = u_m² (1 - (b²/B²))² = u_m² [1 - 2(b²/B²) + (b^4/B^4)]

Integrate from -B to B:

∫ u² db = u_m² [ ∫1 db - 2 ∫ (b²/B²) db + ∫ (b^4/B^4) db ]

Compute each term:

∫1 db = 2B

∫ (b²/B²) db = (1/B²) * (b³/3) from -B to B = (1/B²)( (B³/3) - (-B³/3) ) = (2B)/3

∫ (b^4/B^4) db = (1/B^4) * (b^5/5) from -B to B = (1/B^4)( (B^5/5) - (-B^5/5) )) = (2 B^5)/(5 B^4) )= 2B/5

So putting it together:

∫ u² db = u_m² [ 2B - 2*(2B/3) + 2B/5 ]

= u_m² [ 2B - (4B/3) + (2B/5) ]

Find a common denominator, which is 15.

= u_m² [ (30B/15) - (20B/15) + (6B/15) ) ]

= u_m² [ (30 -20 +6) B /15 ) ]

= u_m² [ 16B /15 ]

Then, β = [ ∫ u² dA ] / [ A (V_avg)^2 ]

Here, A (area) is 2B * width, but since we're integrating over b, the width cancels. So A = 2B.

V_avg was (2/3) u_m.

So,

β = [ (16B/15) u_m² ] / [ 2B * ( (2/3 u_m )^2 ) ]

= [ (16B/15) u_m² ] / [ 2B * (4/9 u_m²) ) ]

= [ (16B/15) ] / [ (8B/9) ) ]

= (16/15) / (8/9) = (16/15) * (9/8) )= (144)/(120) )= 1.2

So β is 1.2 for part a.

Looking at the options, option E's part a says β=1.20. So part a is correct in option E.

Now part b:

The velocity profile is u = u_m (y/R)^{1/7} = u_m [1 - (r/R)]^{1/7}, where y is the radial distance from the wall, and r = R - y.

Wait, the equation is given as u = u_m (y/R)^{1/7}, but y is the radial distance from the wall, so y ranges from 0 (at the wall) to R (at the center). Alternatively, using r = R - y, which would mean r goes from R (wall) to 0 (center). But the equation is written as u = u_m (y/R)^{1/7}, which would be zero at the wall (y=0) and maximum at the center (y=R), so u_m is the centerline velocity.

Now, I need to find the average velocity and the momentum correction factor β.

First, average velocity V_avg = (1/A) ∫ u dA.

The flow is in a circular tube, so area is π R². But since the velocity varies with r or y, let's express it in terms of r.

Wait, the given equation uses y as the radial distance from the wall, so y = R - r, where r is the distance from the center. So when y=0, r=R (wall), and y=R, r=0 (center).

So u = u_m (y/R)^{1/7} = u_m [(R - r)/R]^{1/7} = u_m (1 - r/R)^{1/7}.

In polar coordinates, the area element is 2π r dr. So the integral for V_avg becomes:

V_avg = (1/(π R²)) ∫ (from r=0 to R) u(r) * 2π r dr

= (2/(R²)) ∫ (from 0 to R) u_m (1 - r/R)^{1/7} r dr

Factor out u_m and R:

= (2 u_m) / R² ∫ (from 0 to R) (1 - r/R)^{1/7} r dr

Let’s make a substitution: let x = r/R → r = x R, dr = R dx. When r=0, x=0; when r=R, x=1.

Integral becomes:

= (2 u_m) / R² ∫ (from 0 to 1) (1 - x)^{1/7} (x R) (R dx)

= (2 u_m) / R² * R² ∫ (from 0 to 1) x (1 - x)^{1/7} dx

= 2 u_m ∫ x (1 - x)^{1/7} dx from 0 to 1

This integral is a standard Beta function. The integral ∫ x^{a-1} (1-x)^{b-1} dx from 0 to 1 is B(a,b) = Γ(a)Γ(b)/Γ(a+b).

Here, a=2 (since x^1), b= 1 + 1/7 = 8/7.

So B(2, 8/7) = Γ(2) Γ(8/7) / Γ(2 + 8/7) = Γ(2) Γ(8/7) / Γ(22/7)

We know Γ(n) = (n-1)! for integers. Γ(2)=1! =1.

So the integral becomes B(2,8/7) = [1 * Γ(8/7)] / Γ(22/7).

Now, Γ(8/7) and Γ(22/7) can be expressed in terms of factorials, but perhaps it's easier to compute numerically.

Alternatively, using the formula for Beta function in terms of factorials:

B(a,b) = ( (a-1)! (b-1)! ) / (a + b -1)! )

But a=2, b=8/7 → a-1=1, b-1=1/7.

So B(2,8/7) = (1! * (1/7)! ) / ( (2 +8/7 -1)! ) → but this seems complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps compute numerically.

The integral ∫ x (1-x)^{1/7} dx from 0 to1 can be computed using substitution or known values.

Alternatively, perhaps use the fact that B(m,n) = ∫0^1 t^{m-1} (1-t)^{n-1} dt, so here m=2, n=8/7.

The value of B(2,8/7) can be looked up or calculated numerically.

But perhaps it's easier to note that:

∫ x (1 - x)^{1/7} dx from 0 to1 = B(2, 8/7) = [Γ(2)Γ(8/7)] / Γ(2 + 8/7) )= [Γ(2)Γ(8/7)] / Γ(22/7).

Since Γ(2)=1, it's Γ(8/7)/Γ(22/7).

Now, using Γ(z+1) = z Γ(z), so Γ(22/7) = (15/7) Γ(15/7).

But 15/7 is approximately 2.14, and Γ(15/7) = (8/7) Γ(8/7).

So,

Γ(22/7) = (15/7) Γ(15/7) = (15/7)(8/7) Γ(8/7) = (120/49) Γ(8/7).

Thus,

B(2,8/7) = Γ(8/7) / [ (120/49) Γ(8/7) ) ] = 49/120.

So the integral is 49/120.

Thus, V_avg = 2 u_m * (49/120) = (98/120) u_m = (49/60) u_m.

So part b's average velocity is (49/60) u_m. Looking at the options, option E's part b says average velocity = (49/60) u_m, which matches.

Now, the momentum correction factor β is given by β = (∫ u² dA) / (A (V_avg)^2 )

So compute ∫ u² dA.

Again, using polar coordinates, dA = 2π r dr.

u² = u_m² (1 - r/R)^{2/7}.

So,

∫ u² dA = ∫ (from 0 to R) u_m² (1 - r/R)^{2/7} * 2π r dr

= 2 π u_m² ∫ (from 0 to R) r (1 - r/R)^{2/7} dr.

Again, let x = r/R → r = x R, dr = R dx.

So,

= 2 π u_m² ∫ (0 to1) (x R) (1 -x)^{2/7} R dx

= 2 π u_m² R² ∫ x (1-x)^{2/7} dx from 0 to1.

This integral is B(2, 9/7) = Γ(2)Γ(9/7)/Γ(16/7).

Again, Γ(2)=1, so B(2,9/7) = Γ(9/7)/Γ(16/7).

Now, Γ(16/7) = (9/7) Γ(9/7).

So,

B(2,9/7) = Γ(9/7) / [ (9/7) Γ(9/7) ) ] = 7/9.

Wait, that's not correct. Because Γ(16/7) = (9/7) Γ(9/7), so

B(2,9/7) = [Γ(2)Γ(9/7)] / Γ(2 +9/7) = [1 * Γ(9/7)] / Γ(23/7).

Wait, 2 +9/7 = 23/7. Hmm, so perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, 2 +9/7= (14 +9)/7=23/7. So Γ(23/7).

So,

B(2,9/7) = Γ(9/7)/Γ(23/7).

But Γ(23/7) = (16/7) Γ(16/7) = (16/7)(9/7) Γ(9/7) = (144/49) Γ(9/7).

Thus,

B(2,9/7) = Γ(9/7) / (144/49 Γ(9/7)) )= 49/144.

So the integral ∫ x (1-x)^{2/7} dx = 49/144.

Thus,

∫ u² dA = 2 π u_m² R² * (49/144).

Now, A = π R².

So,

β = [ ∫ u² dA ] / [ A (V_avg)^2 ]

= [ 2 π u_m² R² (49/144) ) ] / [ π R² * (49/60 u_m )^2 ]

Simplify numerator and denominator:

Numerator: 2 π u_m² R² * (49/144) )

Denominator: π R² * (49² / (60²)) u_m² )

So,

β = [ 2 * (49/144) ) ] / [ (49²)/(60²) ) ]

= [ 2 * 49 /144 ] / [ (49^2)/(60^2) ]

Simplify:

= [ 2 * 49 * 60^2 ] / [ 144 * 49^2 ]

The 49 cancels once:

= [ 2 * 60^2 ] / [ 144 * 49 ]

Calculate 60^2 = 3600.

So,

= [ 2 * 3600 ] / (144 *49 )

= 7200 / (144 *49 )

Simplify 7200 /144 = 50.

So,

= 50 /49 ≈1.0204.

So β ≈1.0204, which rounds to 1.020.

Looking at the options, option E's part b says β=1.020, which matches.

Now part c:

Velocities measured at equal increments of (r/R)^2 represent equal area increments. So the data is given as 18.2, 16.8, 14.9, 12.75, 10.9, 9.4, 7.9, 6.5, 5.6, and 4.5 m/s.

We have 10 data points, each corresponding to equal (r/R)^2 intervals, which implies equal area increments because in a circular duct, the area element is proportional to r dr. So if r^2 increments are equal, then each step in r corresponds to equal area slices.

Wait, but actually, when you have equal increments of (r/R)^2, that doesn't directly translate to equal area increments. Because area element is 2πr dr, so to have equal area increments, dr must vary as 1/r. So perhaps the question is that the measurements are taken at points where each step in (r/R)^2 is equal, which would result in equal area increments. So each measured velocity corresponds to an equal area.

So to find the average velocity, since each measurement corresponds to equal area, the average velocity is simply the average of the measured velocities.

So, sum all the velocities and divide by 10.

Let's add them up:

18.2 +16.8 =35

35 +14.9=50

50 +12.75=62.75

62.75 +10.9=73.65

73.65 +9.4=83.05

83.05 +7.9=90.95

90.95 +6.5=97.45

97.45 +5.6=103.05

103.05 +4.5=107.55

So total sum is 107.55 m/s.

Average velocity = 107.55 /10 = 10.755 m/s, which rounds to 10.76 m/s. But looking at the options, option E's part c says average velocity=10.75 m/s, which matches.

Now, the momentum correction factor β is calculated as the ratio of the momentum flux to the momentum flux assuming uniform flow.

Momentum flux = ∫ u dA

Momentum flux assuming uniform flow = A * V_avg^2.

Wait, no. Momentum correction factor β is defined as:

β = (∫ u^2 dA) / (A (V_avg)^2 )

So I need to compute ∫ u^2 dA and then divide by A (V_avg)^2.

But since the measurements are at equal area increments, each velocity u_i corresponds to an area element ΔA_i. So the integral ∫ u^2 dA can be approximated by summing u_i^2 * ΔA_i.

Since each ΔA_i is equal (because the measurements are at equal area increments), the sum becomes (ΔA) * sum(u_i^2).

Thus, ∫ u^2 dA = ΔA * sum(u_i^2)

And A = 10 * ΔA, since there are 10 equal area increments.

So,

β = [ sum(u_i^2) * ΔA ] / [ (10 ΔA) (V_avg)^2 ]

The ΔA cancels, so:

β = sum(u_i^2) / (10 (V_avg)^2 )

We have V_avg=10.755 m/s (approx 10.75 as per option E).

Compute sum of u_i^2:

18.2^2 = 331.24

16.8^2 = 282.24

14.9^2 = 222.01

12.75^2=162.56

10.9^2=118.81

9.4^2=88.36

7.9^2=62.41

6.5^2=42.25

5.6^2=31.36

4.5^2=20.25

Adding these:

331.24 +282.24 =613.48

613.48 +222.01=835.49

835.49 +162.56=998.05

998.05 +118.81=1116.86

1116.86 +88.36=1205.22

1205.22 +62.41=1267.63

1267.63 +42.25=1309.88

1309.88 +31.36=1341.24

1341.24 +20.25=1361.49

So sum of squares is 1361.49.

Now, β = 1361.49 / (10 * (10.755)^2 )

Calculate (10.755)^2: 10.755^2 ≈ 115.64 (since 10^2=100, 10.75^2=115.56, so approx 115.64)

So denominator =10 * 115.64 ≈1156.4

Thus,

β ≈1361.49 /1156.4 ≈1.177.

Looking at the options, option E's part c says β=1.178, which is very close.

So compiling all parts:

a) Average velocity= (2/3) u_m, β=1.20 → option E part a.

b) Average velocity=(49/60) u_m, β=1.020 → option E part b.

c) Average velocity=10.75 m/s, β=1.178 → option E part c.

Thus, the correct option is E.
</think>

The correct answer is E.

**Explanation:**

For part a, the average velocity is (2/3)u_m and the momentum correction factor β is 1.20.  
For part b, the average velocity is (49/60)u_m and β is approximately 1.020.  
For part c, the average velocity is 10.75 m/s and β is approximately 1.178.  

These results match option E.

**Answer:**

E
