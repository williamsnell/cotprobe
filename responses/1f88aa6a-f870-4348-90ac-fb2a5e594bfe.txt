Okay, so I have this PL/I question to tackle. It's about the default attributes of variables when the programmer doesn't provide full explicit declarations. I'm a bit rusty on PL/I, but I'll try to think it through.

The question has five parts, a to e, each asking about a different variable. The options are A through J, each providing different attributes for these variables. I need to figure out which option correctly lists the defaults for each variable.

Let me break down each part one by one.

Starting with part a: a variable named PERCENT (1:8). Wait, in PL/I, when you have parentheses after the variable name, that's specifying the dimensions. So PERCENT is a variably dimensioned array. The format is (1:8), which I think means it's a one-dimensional array with indices from 1 to 8. So it's an array of 8 elements.

Now, what are the default attributes for such a variable if not explicitly declared? I remember that in PL/I, variables have certain default attributes. For variably dimensioned variables, the default is usually DECIMAL (DEC) with a size. Also, I think the default size when not specified is the maximum possible, which is usually 18 digits, but sometimes it's 15. Wait, no, wait: for decimals, the default is 15 digits if the size isn't specified. But when the variable is declared as (1:8), the size defaults to the maximum, which is 18 digits. Or is it 15? I'm getting confused. Wait, no, I think for fixed decimals, the default size is 15 digits. But for variably dimensioned arrays, I'm not sure. Maybe it's 15? Or perhaps 18? Or maybe it's 15 for fixed and 18 for some other cases. Hmm.

Wait, I think when you have a variable like PERCENT (1:8), the default is DECIMAL with a size of 15. So PERCENT would be DEC(15). But looking at the options, I don't see any with 15. Wait, let me check the options. Wait, the options are A through J, each part a to e. Let me look at each option's part a.

Option A: a) PERCENT(1:8)DEC, REAL, FLOAT(6). So here, PERCENT is declared as DEC, but with no size specified, so default is 15. But the option lists PERCENT(1:8)DEC, so that's correct. But wait, why is there a REAL and FLOAT(6) as well? Oh, because in PL/I, a variable can have multiple attributes. So for example, a variable can be declared as DECIMAL and also have other attributes like REAL or FLOAT. Wait, but no, I think that's not how it works. Because DEC is for fixed-point decimals, while REAL and FLOAT are for floating-point numbers. So a variable can't be both DEC and REAL at the same time. So perhaps the option is listing the attributes, but in reality, the default is just DEC(15). Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, maybe the question is about the default when no explicit declaration is given. So for a variable like PERCENT (1:8), what is the default? The default is that it's a variably dimensioned array, and the element type is fixed decimal (DEC) with a default size of 15 digits. So the attributes would be PERCENT(1:8)DEC(15). But looking at the options, none of them have 15 in the DEC part. Let me check the options again.

Option A: a) PERCENT(1:8)DEC, REAL, FLOAT(6). So DEC without size, which implies 15. But then also REAL and FLOAT? That doesn't seem right because a variable can't have multiple types. So perhaps the option is wrong.

Wait, maybe the question is about the attributes that the compiler assigns, considering that if the variable isn't declared, it takes defaults. But here, the variable is declared with (1:8), so it's an array, but the element type is defaulting. So the element type is DEC(15). So the correct part a would be PERCENT(1:8)DEC(15). Looking at the options, let's see.

Option A: PERCENT(1:8)DEC, ... So that matches. But then why are there REAL and FLOAT(6) in the same line? That doesn't make sense because a variable can't be both DEC and REAL. So perhaps the option is wrong. Or maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe the question is about the possible attributes that could be assigned, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the question is not about the element type but about the variable's attributes beyond that. Like, maybe the variable's storage or other attributes. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the question is considering that when a variable is variably dimensioned, it's a fixed decimal by default, so PERCENT is PERCENT(1:8)DEC(15). So looking for that.

Looking at the options, each part a has PERCENT with different specifications. For example, option H: a) PERCENT(1:5)DEC, REAL, FLOAT(6). So that's not matching (1:8). So perhaps the correct option for a) has PERCENT(1:8)DEC.

Looking at the options, option A: a) PERCENT(1:8)DEC, etc. So that's the only one with (1:8). So option A's a is correct for the dimension, but the other parts may not be.

Wait, but the other parts of option A's a) include REAL and FLOAT(6), which I don't think is correct because a variable can't have multiple types. So perhaps the option is wrong, but maybe the question is considering additional attributes beyond the type. Or perhaps it's a typo, and the options are just showing the types, not all attributes.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking about the possible attributes, not the exact ones. Or maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me move to part b and see if I can find a pattern.

Part b: a variable named AMOUNT FIXED. So FIXED in PL/I usually refers to fixed-point decimal. Wait, no, FIXED is a type. So AMOUNT is declared as FIXED. So when you declare a variable as FIXED without any size, the default size is 15 digits. Also, the default is that it's a fixed decimal. So AMOUNT would be FIXED(15). But in the options, looking at each part b:

Option A: b) AMOUNT FIXED (5) DEC, REAL. So AMOUNT is FIXED(5), which is smaller than default. Wait, but if the programmer doesn't provide a size, the default is 15. So FIXED without size is FIXED(15). So option A's part b is incorrect because it's FIXED(5).

Option B: part b) AMOUNT FIXED (9) DEC, REAL. Again, FIXED(9) is not the default. Default is 15.

Option C: part b) AMOUNT FIXED (12) DEC, REAL.

Option D: part b) AMOUNT FIXED (11) DEC, REAL.

Option E: part b) AMOUNT FIXED (4) DEC, REAL.

Option F: part b) AMOUNT FIXED (6) DEC, REAL.

Option G: part b) AMOUNT FIXED (8) DEC, REAL.

Option H: part b) AMOUNT FIXED (7) DEC, REAL.

Option I: part b) AMOUNT FIXED (10) DEC, REAL.

Option J: part b) AMOUNT FIXED (13) DEC, REAL.

Hmm, all options have AMOUNT FIXED with a size less than 15. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Wait, perhaps when a variable is declared as FIXED without a size, it's indeed 15 digits. So the default is FIXED(15). But the options don't have any part b with FIXED(15). So perhaps the question is wrong, or I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, perhaps in the options, the part b is written as AMOUNT FIXED (n) DEC. So that would imply that the size is n, but perhaps the default is 15. So none of the options have FIXED(15), which suggests that perhaps the question is considering something else.

Alternatively, maybe the question is about the alignment. For example, when you declare a variable as FIXED, it's aligned on word boundaries. But I don't think that's relevant here.

Wait, perhaps the question is not about the size but about the default storage or something else. I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should move to part c and see.

Part c: a variable named NUMBER COMPLEX. COMPLEX in PL/I is a complex number type. So when you declare a variable as COMPLEX without specifying the size, the default is COMPLEX(15), which uses 15 significant digits for both real and imaginary parts. So NUMBER would be COMPLEX(15). But looking at the options:

Option A: c) NUMBERFIXED(5) DEC COMPLEX. Wait, that doesn't make sense because COMPLEX is a separate type, not a modification of DEC. So that's probably incorrect.

Option B: c) NUMBERFIXED(2) DEC COMPLEX. Again, same issue.

Option C: c) NUMBERFIXED(1) DEC COMPLEX.

Option D: c) NUMBERFIXED(9) DEC COMPLEX.

Option E: c) NUMBERFIXED(6) DEC COMPLEX.

Option F: c) NUMBERFIXED(4) DEC COMPLEX.

Option G: c) NUMBERFIXED(7) DEC COMPLEX.

Option H: c) NUMBERFIXED(3) DEC COMPLEX.

Option I: c) NUMBERFIXED(8) DEC COMPLEX.

Option J: c) NUMBERFIXED(10) DEC COMPLEX.

Wait, all options have NUMBER followed by FIXED and then COMPLEX. That can't be right because COMPLEX is a type on its own. So perhaps the options are incorrect. Or maybe the question is about the underlying representation. Wait, perhaps when you declare a COMPLEX variable, it's made up of two REAL parts. So maybe the default is COMPLEX(15), but the options don't show that. So perhaps the correct option for part c is that NUMBER is COMPLEX(15), but none of the options have that. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.

Alternatively, maybe the question is considering that the default for COMPLEX without size is 15 digits, but the options don't show that. So perhaps none of the options are correct, but that's unlikely.

Moving on to part d: a variable named TOTAL BINARY. BINARY in PL/I refers to binary floating-point numbers. The default size for BINARY is 24 bits, which is equivalent to FLOAT(24). So TOTAL would be BINARY(24). But in the options, looking at part d:

Option A: d) TOTAL FLOAT (21) BINARY REAL. Wait, that seems off. FLOAT(21) is a floating-point with 21 bits, but BINARY is a type, not a size. So perhaps the option is trying to say BINARY(21). But I'm not sure.

Wait, in PL/I, BINARY is a type that defaults to BINARY(24), which is the same as FLOAT(24). So the correct default is BINARY(24). Looking at the options:

Option A: d) TOTAL FLOAT (21) BINARY REAL. Hmm, that doesn't seem right. FLOAT(21) is a different thing. So perhaps the correct part d is TOTAL BINARY(24). But the options don't have that. Let's check each option's part d.

Option A: d) TOTAL FLOAT(21) BINARY REAL. That seems incorrect.

Option B: d) TOTAL FLOAT(23) BINARY REAL.

Option C: d) TOTAL FLOAT(26) BINARY REAL.

Option D: d) TOTAL FLOAT(25) BINARY REAL.

Option E: d) TOTAL FLOAT(20) BINARY REAL.

Option F: d) TOTAL FLOAT(22) BINARY REAL.

Option G: d) TOTAL FLOAT(19) BINARY REAL.

Option H: d) TOTAL FLOAT(18) BINARY REAL.

Option I: d) TOTAL FLOAT(24) BINARY REAL.

Option J: d) TOTAL FLOAT(27) BINARY REAL.

Wait, none of the options have BINARY(24). Instead, they have BINARY along with a FLOAT(n). That seems odd because BINARY is a type, not a size. So perhaps the options are trying to represent that the default is BINARY(24), which is equivalent to FLOAT(24). So in that case, the correct part d would have FLOAT(24). Looking at the options, option I has d) TOTAL FLOAT(24) BINARY REAL. So that's the correct one. But wait, why is it written as FLOAT(24) BINARY REAL? That seems redundant because BINARY is a type, and FLOAT is another type. So perhaps the option is incorrect, but among the options, option I has the correct size.

Wait, but option I's part d is d) TOTAL FLOAT (24) BINARY REAL. That doesn't seem right because BINARY is a type, not a size. So perhaps the correct part d is TOTAL BINARY(24), but the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct option is I, but I'm not sure.

Finally, part e: a variable named INCANT. Since it's not specified, it's a scalar variable. The default type in PL/I is REAL(14), which is a floating-point number with 14 significant digits. So INCANT would be REAL(14). Looking at the options:

Option A: e) INCANTFIXED(15) BIN, REAL. Wait, BIN is binary integer? Or is it a typo for BINARY? Or perhaps it's a mistake.

Option B: e) INCANTFIXED(11) BIN, REAL.

Option C: e) INCANTFIXED(13) BIN, REAL.

Option D: e) INCANTFIXED(18) BIN, REAL.

Option E: e) INCANTFIXED(14) BIN, REAL.

Option F: e) INCANTFIXED(16) BIN, REAL.

Option G: e) INCANTFIXED(12) BIN, REAL.

Option H: e) INCANTFIXED(10) BIN, REAL.

Option I: e) INCANTFIXED(17) BIN, REAL.

Option J: e) INCANTFIXED(19) BIN, REAL.

Wait, all options have INCANT followed by FIXED and BIN. But the default for a variable not declared is REAL(14), not FIXED. So all these options are incorrect because they have FIXED and BIN. So perhaps none of the options are correct, but that can't be the case. Maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering that when a variable isn't declared, it's treated as a fixed binary integer with default size. But I thought the default was REAL. So perhaps I'm wrong.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me recall: in PL/I, if you don't declare a variable, it's a scalar variable with default attributes. The default is:

- For arithmetic variables, the default is REAL(14) if the variable is used in an arithmetic expression.

But wait, I think that's not entirely accurate. Let me think again. In PL/I, variables that are not explicitly declared take default attributes as follows:

- If the variable is used in an arithmetic expression, it is a scalar variable. The default is:

   - If the variable is assigned a value that is an integer literal, the variable is treated as a FIXED(15) quantity.

   - If the variable is assigned a value that is a decimal literal (with a decimal point), it's treated as a FLOAT(14) or REAL(14).

   - If the variable is used in a context that requires a floating-point value, it defaults to REAL(14).

   - If the variable is used in a context that requires an integer, it defaults to FIXED(15).

But if the variable isn't assigned any value, its default is:

- If used in an expression, it is a scalar variable with default type depending on usage.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The question states that the programmer doesn't provide full explicit declarations. So the variable takes default attributes.

In PL/I, the default for a variable not declared is:

- A scalar variable.

- The default data type is determined by the context in which it's used.

But if we assume that it's used in a way that requires a floating-point number, the default is REAL(14). If it's used as an integer, it's FIXED(15).

But since the question doesn't specify usage, perhaps the default is scalar with default attributes, which is usually REAL(14). So INCANT would be REAL(14). But looking at the options, none of them have REAL(14). Instead, they have FIXED with various sizes and BIN.

Wait, BIN in PL/I stands for binary integer, which is the same as FIXED. So perhaps the default is FIXED(15). But that would make the default type FIXED, not REAL. So perhaps the question is considering that the default is FIXED(15). So looking at the options, which option has part e as INCANTFIXED(n) BIN, where n is 15?

Looking at the options:

Option A: e) INCANTFIXED(15) BIN, REAL. So FIXED(15) and BIN. But BIN is another way to say binary integer, which is the same as FIXED. So perhaps this is correct. But why is there a REAL in the same line? That doesn't make sense.

Option E: e) INCANTFIXED(14) BIN, REAL.

Option D: e) INCANTFIXED(18) BIN, REAL.

Hmm, but the default for a variable not declared and used as an integer is FIXED(15). So if the variable is used as an integer, it's FIXED(15). But if it's used as a floating-point, it's REAL(14). Since the question doesn't specify usage, perhaps the default is to be a real number, so REAL(14). But none of the options have that.

Alternatively, perhaps the default is REAL(14), but the options don't show that. So perhaps the correct option is not present, but that can't be.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me think again. For part a, the variable is PERCENT (1:8). So it's an array. The default for each element is DEC(15). So the correct part a is PERCENT(1:8)DEC(15). Looking at the options, only option A has PERCENT(1:8)DEC. The other parts of option A's a) include REAL and FLOAT(6), which I think is incorrect because a variable can't have multiple types.

Wait, perhaps the question is not about the type but about the attributes beyond the type. Like, perhaps the variable is considered as a fixed decimal and also has other attributes, but that doesn't make sense because a variable can only have one type.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the variable is declared as an array, so it's an array of fixed decimals, and perhaps also has other attributes like being real or float, but that's not possible.

I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should try to find a pattern. Let's see what each option's part a is:

Option A: a) PERCENT(1:8)DEC, REAL, FLOAT(6)

Option B: a) PERCENT(1:6)DEC, REAL, FLOAT(7)

Option C: a) PERCENT(2:8)DEC, REAL, FLOAT(5)

Option D: a) PERCENT(1:12)DEC, REAL, FLOAT(2)

Option E: a) PERCENT(1:9)DEC, REAL, FLOAT(5)

Option F: a) PERCENT(1:10)DEC, REAL, FLOAT(8)

Option G: a) PERCENT(1:7)DEC, REAL, FLOAT(4)

Option H: a) PERCENT(1:5)DEC, REAL, FLOAT(6)

Option I: a) PERCENT(1:11)DEC, REAL, FLOAT(3)

Option J: a) PERCENT(3:9)DEC, REAL, FLOAT(9)

From this, only option A has the correct dimension (1:8). So perhaps option A is the correct one, despite the other parts possibly being wrong. But then, I need to check the other parts for option A.

Option A: part b) AMOUNT FIXED (5) DEC, REAL.

As I thought earlier, AMOUNT should be FIXED(15), but option A has FIXED(5), which is incorrect. So perhaps option A is not correct.

Alternatively, maybe the question is about the size when not specified, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the default size when the variable is variably dimensioned. For example, PERCENT (1:8) would have each element as DEC with default size 15. So part a is correct in option A. Then, part b: AMOUNT is FIXED without size, so default is FIXED(15). But option A's part b is FIXED(5), which is wrong.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Maybe I should try to find which option has the correct part a and part d.

Wait, part d is about TOTAL BINARY. As I thought earlier, the default is BINARY(24), which is FLOAT(24). Looking at the options, option I has part d as FLOAT(24) BINARY REAL. That seems incorrect because BINARY is a type, not a size. But among the options, option I has the correct size. So perhaps option I is correct for part d.

But then, part a in option I is PERCENT(1:11)DEC, REAL, FLOAT(3). But the correct part a should be (1:8)DEC(15). So option I's part a is incorrect.

This is getting too confusing. Maybe I should try to find a way to cross-reference.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option E. Let me check.

Option E: a) PERCENT(1:9)DEC, REAL, FLOAT(5). So dimension is (1:9), which is wrong.

Option F: a) PERCENT(1:10)DEC, REAL, FLOAT(8). Dimension is (1:10), wrong.

Option G: a) PERCENT(1:7)DEC, REAL, FLOAT(4). Dimension is (1:7), wrong.

Option H: a) PERCENT(1:5)DEC, REAL, FLOAT(6). Dimension is (1:5), wrong.

Option I: a) PERCENT(1:11)DEC, REAL, FLOAT(3). Dimension is (1:11), wrong.

Option J: a) PERCENT(3:9)DEC, REAL, FLOAT(9). Dimension is (3:9), wrong.

So only option A has the correct dimension for part a. But its part b is wrong. So perhaps none of the options are correct, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe the question is about the default when the variable is declared with certain keywords, but not fully specified. For example, for part a, PERCENT (1:8) would have each element as DEC(15). So the correct part a is PERCENT(1:8)DEC(15). Looking at the options, none have (1:8) except option A. So option A's part a is correct, but the other attributes are wrong.

But since the question asks for the default attributes, perhaps the other attributes are also part of the defaults. Wait, perhaps the question is considering that the variable is also treated as a real or float, but that doesn't make sense because a variable can't have multiple types.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is not about the type but about the storage or other attributes. But I'm not sure.

I think I'm stuck and need to make an educated guess. Given that only option A has the correct dimension for part a, I'll assume that option A is the correct one, despite the other parts possibly being incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong about part b and the default size for FIXED is 5, but I don't think so.

Wait, perhaps the default size for FIXED is 5? No, I'm pretty sure it's 15. So option A's part b is wrong. So perhaps the correct answer is not option A.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me think again about part a. The variable is PERCENT (1:8). So it's an array with 8 elements. The default type is DEC(15). So the correct part a is PERCENT(1:8)DEC(15). Looking at the options, none have that. So perhaps the correct answer is not present, but that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the default for a variably dimensioned array is DEC(15), so the correct part a is PERCENT(1:8)DEC. So option A's part a is correct. But then, the other parts may have errors, but perhaps the question is only about part a.

But the question asks about all five variables, so the entire option must be correct.

I'm really stuck. Maybe I should look for another approach. Perhaps the correct answer is option E.

Wait, option E's part a is PERCENT(1:9)DEC, which is wrong. So no.

Option F: part a is PERCENT(1:10)DEC. Wrong.

Option G: part a is PERCENT(1:7)DEC. Wrong.

Option H: part a is PERCENT(1:5)DEC. Wrong.

Option I: part a is PERCENT(1:11)DEC. Wrong.

Option J: part a is PERCENT(3:9)DEC. Wrong.

So only option A has part a correct. But part b is wrong. So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is not about the size but about the type. For part a, PERCENT is an array of DEC. So the correct part a is PERCENT(1:8)DEC. Option A's part a is correct. Then, part b: AMOUNT is FIXED, default size 15. So option A's part b is FIXED(5), which is wrong. So perhaps the correct option is not A.

I'm really stuck. Maybe I should just go with option A, assuming that the other parts are correct, even if I'm not sure.
</think>

The question involves determining the default attributes of variables in PL/I when explicit declarations are not provided. Each part (a to e) describes a variable, and the task is to match these variables with their correct default attributes from the given options (A to J). 

### Analysis of Each Variable:

1. **Variable a) PERCENT (1:8):**
   - This is a variably dimensioned array with 8 elements.
   - The default type for such variables is `DECIMAL (DEC)` with a size of 15 digits.
   - Among the options, only **Option A** correctly specifies `PERCENT(1:8)DEC`. However, the additional attributes `REAL` and `FLOAT(6)` are incorrect because a variable cannot have multiple types.

2. **Variable b) AMOUNT FIXED:**
   - The default size for a `FIXED` variable without an explicit size is 15 digits.
   - None of the options correctly specify `FIXED(15)`. **Option A** lists `FIXED(5)`, which is incorrect.

3. **Variable c) NUMBER COMPLEX:**
   - The default size for a `COMPLEX` variable is 15 digits for both the real and imaginary parts.
   - All options incorrectly combine `FIXED` with `COMPLEX`, which is not valid syntax. None of the options correctly represent `COMPLEX(15)`.

4. **Variable d) TOTAL BINARY:**
   - The default size for `BINARY` (binary floating-point) is 24 bits, equivalent to `FLOAT(24)`.
   - **Option I** correctly specifies `FLOAT(24)`, though the inclusion of `BINARY REAL` is redundant and technically incorrect.

5. **Variable e) INCANT:**
   - By default, a variable not explicitly declared is treated as a scalar. If used in a context requiring an integer, it defaults to `FIXED(15)`. If used as a floating-point, it defaults to `REAL(14)`.
   - None of the options correctly represent this default behavior. **Option A** lists `FIXED(15) BIN, REAL`, which is redundant and technically incorrect.

### Conclusion:
While **Option A** correctly identifies the dimension for `PERCENT(1:8)`, the other parts of the option are incorrect. Despite this, **Option A** is the closest match to the correct defaults, particularly for part a.

**Answer: A**
