Okay, so I've got this problem here about helium flowing through a channel. The question is asking for the Mach number at a second point downstream, given some initial conditions and assuming isentropic flow. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

First, I remember that in isentropic flow, the relation between pressure and Mach number is important. The Mach number is the ratio of the flow speed to the speed of sound. Since the flow is isentropic, we can use the isentropic relations for compressible flow.

The given data are: at the first point, the pressure P1 is 30 psia and Mach number M1 is 1.5. Downstream, the pressure P2 is 15 psia. We need to find M2.

I recall the isentropic relation between pressure and Mach number is given by:

P / P0 = (1 + γ / 2 * M²) ^ (-γ / (γ - 1))

Wait, but wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the ratio of the pressures at two points. Since the process is isentropic, the same relation applies for both points. So, I can set up the equation as:

(P2 / P1) = ( (1 + (γ/2) * M1² ) / (1 + (γ/2) * M2² ) ) ^ (γ / (γ - 1))

But wait, no, actually, the relation is for P/P0, where P0 is the reference pressure. But since we're comparing two points along the same flow, I think the correct approach is to use the ratio of absolute pressures. Alternatively, maybe it's better to use the relation for the same reference pressure.

Wait, perhaps another approach. The relation between pressure and Mach number is:

P / P0 = (1 + (γ/2) M²)^(-γ/(γ-1))

But without knowing P0, maybe it's easier to consider the ratio of pressures between the two points.

Alternatively, the relation can be written as:

(P2 / P1) = ( (1 + (γ/2) M1²) / (1 + (γ/2) M2²) ) ^ (γ/(γ-1))

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me think again. The isentropic process implies that the stagnation pressure remains constant, so P0 is the same at both points. Therefore, the ratio P2/P1 can be expressed as the ratio of the individual pressure terms.

So, (P2 / P1) = [ (1 + (γ/2) M1² ) / (1 + (γ/2) M2² ) ] ^ ( (γ - 1)/γ )

Wait, no, because the exponent would be negative. Let me check the exact formula.

The correct formula for the pressure ratio in isentropic flow is:

P / P0 = (1 + (γ/2) M² )^(-γ/(γ-1))

So, taking the ratio of P2 to P1, since P0 is the same for both points, we get:

P2/P1 = [ (1 + (γ/2) M2² ) / (1 + (γ/2) M1² ) ] ^ ( (γ - 1)/γ )

Wait, no, wait. Let me correct that. Since P = P0 * (1 + (γ/2) M² )^(-γ/(γ-1)), then:

P2/P1 = [ (1 + (γ/2) M1² ) / (1 + (γ/2) M2² ) ] ^ ( (γ - 1)/γ )

Wait, no, because if P1 is at M1, then P1 = P0 * (1 + (γ/2) M1² )^(-γ/(γ-1)), and similarly for P2. So P2/P1 = [ (1 + (γ/2) M1² ) / (1 + (γ/2) M2² ) ] ^ ( (γ - 1)/γ )

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me rearrange it properly. Let me denote:

P1 = P0 * (1 + (γ/2) M1² )^(-γ/(γ-1))

P2 = P0 * (1 + (γ/2) M2² )^(-γ/(γ-1))

So, P2/P1 = [ (1 + (γ/2) M1² ) / (1 + (γ/2) M2² ) ] ^ ( (γ - 1)/γ )

Hmm, that seems right. So, given that, we can rearrange to solve for M2.

Given that P2 = 15 psia, P1 = 30 psia, so P2/P1 = 0.5.

So,

0.5 = [ (1 + (γ/2) M1² ) / (1 + (γ/2) M2² ) ] ^ ( (γ - 1)/γ )

We can take both sides to the power of (γ/(γ-1)) to invert the exponent.

So,

0.5^(γ/(γ-1)) = (1 + (γ/2) M1² ) / (1 + (γ/2) M2² )

Then,

(1 + (γ/2) M2² ) = (1 + (γ/2) M1² ) / [ 0.5^(γ/(γ-1)) ]

Let me compute each part step by step.

Given γ = 1.67, which is approximately 5/3, since 1.666... is 5/3. So γ = 1.67.

First, compute γ/(γ-1):

γ/(γ-1) = 1.67 / (1.67 - 1) = 1.67 / 0.67 ≈ 2.4925.

Now, compute 0.5 raised to this power:

0.5^2.4925 ≈ ?

Wait, 0.5^2 = 0.25, 0.5^3 ≈ 0.125. So 2.4925 is between 2 and 3. Let's compute it more accurately.

Using logarithms: ln(0.5) = -0.6931.

So ln(0.5^2.4925) = 2.4925 * (-0.6931) ≈ -1.727.

Exponentiating, e^-1.727 ≈ 0.177.

Alternatively, perhaps a calculator would be better, but I'll proceed with 0.177.

So,

0.5^(2.4925) ≈ 0.177.

So,

1 + (γ/2) M2² = [1 + (γ/2) M1² ] / 0.177

Now, compute 1 + (γ/2) M1².

M1 is 1.5, so M1² = 2.25.

γ/2 = 1.67 / 2 ≈ 0.835.

So,

(γ/2) * M1² = 0.835 * 2.25 ≈ 1.87125.

Thus,

1 + 1.87125 = 2.87125.

So,

1 + (γ/2) M2² ≈ 2.87125 / 0.177 ≈ 16.243.

So,

(γ/2) M2² ≈ 16.243 - 1 = 15.243.

M2² ≈ (15.243) / (0.835) ≈ 18.26.

Wait, wait, that can't be right because M can't be higher than 1 in a subsonic flow, but wait, wait, wait. Wait, M1 was 1.5, which is supersonic. But when the pressure decreases downstream, I think the flow becomes more supersonic, so M2 should be higher than M1, but wait, wait, no, wait: in a converging nozzle, when the pressure drops, the flow accelerates. But in a diverging nozzle, when the pressure drops, the flow can become subsonic. Wait, but in this case, we're dealing with a channel, which I think implies a duct, and whether it's converging or diverging depends on the specific setup. Hmm, perhaps I should think again.

Wait, but in an isentropic flow, the relation between pressure and Mach number depends on the area variation. But perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me just proceed with the calculations.

Wait, I think I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check again.

Wait, the denominator is 0.177, so 2.87125 divided by 0.177 is approximately 16.243. So,

1 + (γ/2) M2² = 16.243.

So,

(γ/2) M2² = 16.243 - 1 = 15.243.

Then,

M2² = 15.243 / (γ/2) = 15.243 / 0.835 ≈ 18.26.

So,

M2 = sqrt(18.26) ≈ 4.27.

Wait, that's way higher than the options given. The options go up to 2.80, so I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Hmm, perhaps I messed up the exponent. Let me double-check the formula.

Wait, another approach: perhaps we can use the table provided to find the Mach number corresponding to the pressure ratio.

The table lists for various Mach numbers the corresponding (P/P0) and (M^2).

Wait, but the table is a bit confusing. Let me look at the table again.

The table seems to have two parts: one for M (A/A*) and (P/P0), and another for M (A/A*) and (P/P0). Wait, perhaps it's better to look for the row where P/P0 is 0.5, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the table is structured with Mach numbers and the corresponding (P/P0) and (A/A*) values.

Wait, looking at the table, each row starts with a Mach number, then (A/A*) and (P/P0). For example, the first row after 0 is M=1.75, P/P0=1.312, etc.

Wait, but wait, perhaps the table is for the stagnation pressure ratio (P0/P), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's the static pressure ratio (P/P0). Hmm, maybe I should think differently.

Wait, perhaps using the table would be faster. The given problem has γ=1.67. So, looking for the Mach number where P/P0 is 0.5, but I don't see that directly. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the pressure ratio and then find the corresponding Mach number.

Wait, but let me think. The initial pressure is 30 psia, and downstream it's 15 psia. So, the pressure ratio is 15/30 = 0.5.

In isentropic flow, the pressure ratio is related to the Mach number. So, if I can find the Mach number where P2/P1 = 0.5, that would be M2.

But perhaps using the table is easier. Let me see.

Looking at the table, for each Mach number, the (P/P0) is given. Wait, but since the flow is isentropic, the stagnation pressure remains the same, so P0 is the same at both points. Therefore, the ratio P2/P1 would be (P0 * (1 + (γ/2) M2²)^(-γ/(γ-1))) / (P0 * (1 + (γ/2) M1²)^(-γ/(γ-1))) )

Which simplifies to (P2/P1) = [(1 + (γ/2) M1²)/(1 + (γ/2) M2²)]^(-γ/(γ-1)).

Wait, but perhaps I can find the (P/P0) at M1 and then find the (P/P0) at M2, and set the ratio accordingly.

Wait, let's think differently. At the first point, M1=1.5, P1=30 psia.

The table for M=1.5 is in the row where M=1.50, and the (P/P0) is 1.320. So, P1 = P0 * 1.320.

At the second point, P2=15 psia, so P2 = P0 * (P2/P1) * (P1/P0) ) = P0 * (0.5) * (1.320).

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to think that:

At the first point, P1 = P0 * (1 + (γ/2) M1² )^(-γ/(γ-1)).

Similarly, at the second point, P2 = P0 * (1 + (γ/2) M2² )^(-γ/(γ-1)).

So, the ratio P2/P1 = [ (1 + (γ/2) M1² ) / (1 + (γ/2) M2² ) ]^(-γ/(γ-1)).

We can take logs to solve for M2.

But perhaps using the table is easier. Let me try.

Given that P2/P1 = 0.5, and M1=1.5, P1/P0=1.320 (from the table at M=1.50, (P/P0)=1.320).

So, P2 = 15 psia, P1 =30 psia, so P2/P1=0.5.

Since P2 = P0 * (some factor), and P1 = P0 * 1.320, then:

P2 = P0 * (P2/P1) * (P1/P0) ) = P0 * 0.5 * 1.320 = P0 * 0.66.

Wait, no, perhaps that's not the right approach. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I should use the isentropic relation between P and M. Let me try using the table to find M2.

Looking for the point where P/P0 is lower than at M1=1.5, because P2 is lower than P1, so M2 should be higher than M1, as the flow becomes more supersonic when the pressure drops.

Wait, but looking at the table, at M=1.50, (P/P0)=1.320. As M increases beyond 1.5, (P/P0) decreases, because higher Mach numbers correspond to lower static pressures for the same stagnation pressure.

Wait, but wait, no, because (P/P0) is actually the ratio of static pressure to stagnation pressure, and it decreases as M increases beyond 0. So, higher M leads to lower (P/P0).

Wait, so if P2 is lower than P1, then (P2/P0) < (P1/P0), which implies that M2 > M1, because higher M leads to lower (P/P0).

So, looking for M where (P/P0) is lower than 1.320, which would correspond to higher M than 1.5.

Looking at the table:

At M=1.50, (P/P0)=1.320.

At M=1.75, (P/P0)=1.312.

Wait, that's slightly lower than 1.320, but not by much. Hmm.

Wait, but perhaps I should compute the exact (P/P0) for M2 and see where it fits.

Wait, let's compute (P2/P0) = P2 / (P1/P0) * (P1/P2) ?

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute (P2/P0) = (P2/P1) * (P1/P0) = 0.5 * 1.320 = 0.66.

So, (P2/P0) = 0.66.

Now, looking for the Mach number where (P/P0)=0.66.

Looking at the table:

Looking at the (P/P0) column:

At M=2.00, (P/P0)=1.530.

Wait, that's higher than 0.66. Hmm, that can't be right. Wait, perhaps I'm misreading the table.

Wait, looking again, perhaps the table is structured with M, (A/A*), (P/P0), etc. So for each M, the (P/P0) is given.

Wait, looking for (P/P0) =0.66.

Looking through the table:

At M=1.00, (P/P0)=1.0000.

At M=2.00, (P/P0)=1.530.

Wait, that's higher than 1, which doesn't make sense because at higher M, (P/P0) should decrease. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the table.

Wait, maybe the (P/P0) values are for the stagnation pressure, but that would be P0/P, which would be higher than 1 for M>0.

Wait, perhaps the table is showing (P0/P), the ratio of stagnation pressure to static pressure. Because for M>0, P0/P is greater than 1.

So, if that's the case, then (P0/P) = (1 + (γ/2) M^2 )^(γ/(γ-1)).

So, in that case, for M=1.50, (P0/P)=1.320, which is correct because P0 is higher than P when M>0.

So, in that case, P0/P = 1.320 at M=1.50.

At the second point, P2=15 psia, so P0/P2 = ?

We know that P0 is the same at both points because the flow is isentropic, so P0/P2 = (P0/P1) * (P1/P2) = 1.320 * (30/15) = 1.320 * 2 = 2.64.

So, P0/P2 = 2.64.

Now, looking at the (P0/P) column in the table, we need to find the Mach number where (P0/P) is approximately 2.64.

Looking through the table:

At M=2.00, (P0/P)=1.530.

At M=2.50, (P0/P)=2.135.

At M=2.75, (P0/P)=2.529.

At M=2.80, (P0/P)=2.616.

At M=2.85, (P0/P)=2.705.

Wait, but 2.64 is between M=2.75 and M=2.80.

At M=2.75, (P0/P)=2.529.

At M=2.80, (P0/P)=2.616.

So, 2.64 is between 2.529 and 2.616, so the M would be between 2.75 and 2.80.

But looking at the options given, the closest options are E:2.05 and A:2.80, but 2.80 is an option. But wait, 2.64 is closer to 2.616 (M=2.80) than to 2.529 (M=2.75). Hmm, but perhaps the exact value isn't in the table, so we might have to estimate.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier steps. Let me check again.

Wait, P0/P2 = 2.64, correct?

Yes, because P0/P1=1.320, and P2=15, P1=30, so P2 is half of P1, so P0/P2=1.320 *2=2.64.

So, looking for M where (P0/P)=2.64.

Looking at the table, at M=2.80, (P0/P)=2.616, which is close to 2.64.

At M=2.85, (P0/P)=2.705, which is higher than 2.64.

So, the M would be between 2.80 and 2.85.

But since the options don't include 2.80 as a high option, and the closest option is A:2.80, but wait, the options are A:2.80, E:2.05, etc. Wait, let me check the options again.

The options are:

A: 2.80

B: 1.65

C:0.75

D:1.98

E:2.05

F:2.5

G:1.25

H:0.50

I:0.124

J:1.5

So, option A is 2.80, which has (P0/P)=2.616. We need (P0/P)=2.64, which is slightly higher than 2.616, so M would be slightly higher than 2.80. But since the options don't have a value higher than 2.80, perhaps the intended answer is 2.80.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Let me try another method.

Another approach is to use the relation:

(M2/M1) = [ ( (γ + 1)/(2) ) * (P1/P2) ]^{1/(γ)}

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps using the area ratio.

Wait, perhaps it's better to use the stagnation pressure ratio. The stagnation pressure is constant, so:

(1 + (γ/2) M1² )^(-γ/(γ-1)) = (1 + (γ/2) M2² )^(-γ/(γ-1)) * (P2/P1)

Wait, no, perhaps that's not the right way. Alternatively, let me think about the relation between pressure and Mach number again.

The formula is:

P = P0 * (1 + (γ/2) M² )^(-γ/(γ-1))

So, taking the ratio P2/P1:

P2/P1 = [ (1 + (γ/2) M1² ) / (1 + (γ/2) M2² ) ] ^ ( -γ/(γ-1) )

Taking both sides to the power of (- (γ-1)/γ ):

(P2/P1)^(- (γ-1)/γ ) = (1 + (γ/2) M1² ) / (1 + (γ/2) M2² )

Rearranging:

(1 + (γ/2) M2² ) = (1 + (γ/2) M1² ) / (P2/P1)^(- (γ-1)/γ )

Which simplifies to:

(1 + (γ/2) M2² ) = (1 + (γ/2) M1² ) * (P2/P1)^( (γ-1)/γ )

Now, plugging in the numbers:

P2/P1 = 0.5

γ=1.67

γ/(γ-1) = 1.67/(0.67) ≈ 2.4925

So, (γ-1)/γ ≈ 0.67/1.67 ≈ 0.4.

Wait, 0.67 divided by 1.67 is approximately 0.4012.

So,

(1 + (γ/2) M2² ) = (1 + (γ/2) (1.5)^2 ) * (0.5)^0.4012

Compute each part.

First, compute (γ/2) * M1²:

γ/2 = 0.835

M1=1.5 → M1²=2.25

So,

(γ/2) * M1² = 0.835 * 2.25 ≈ 1.87125

Thus,

1 + 1.87125 ≈ 2.87125.

Now, compute (0.5)^0.4012.

0.5^0.4 ≈ e^(0.4 * ln(0.5)) ≈ e^(0.4*(-0.6931)) ≈ e^(-0.2772) ≈ 0.757.

So,

(0.5)^0.4012 ≈ 0.757.

Thus,

(1 + (γ/2) M2² ) ≈ 2.87125 * 0.757 ≈ 2.173.

So,

(γ/2) M2² ≈ 2.173 -1 = 1.173.

Then,

M2² ≈ 1.173 / (0.835) ≈ 1.405.

So,

M2 ≈ sqrt(1.405) ≈ 1.185.

Wait, that's only about 1.185, which is lower than M1=1.5. But that doesn't make sense because when pressure decreases downstream in a converging duct, the Mach number should increase. Wait, but we don't know if the duct is converging or diverging. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the exponent.

Wait, let's double-check the exponent. Since (γ-1)/γ is approximately 0.4012, the exponent is positive 0.4012.

Wait, but in the formula, it's (P2/P1) raised to (γ-1)/γ, which is 0.4012.

So, (0.5)^0.4012 ≈ 0.757, as before.

So,

(1 + (γ/2) M2² ) ≈ 2.87125 * 0.757 ≈ 2.173.

Which leads to M2≈1.185.

But that's lower than M1=1.5, which seems odd because if the pressure drops and the duct is converging, the Mach number should increase. Alternatively, perhaps the duct is diverging, leading to a decrease in Mach number after a certain point.

Wait, but without knowing the duct's geometry, perhaps the calculation is correct, and the Mach number decreases to 1.185. But looking at the options, the closest higher option is J:1.5, but that's the initial M. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should check the calculation again.

Let me recalculate (0.5)^0.4012.

Using a calculator, 0.5^0.4 is approximately 0.7578.

So,

2.87125 * 0.7578 ≈ 2.173.

So,

(γ/2) M2² = 2.173 - 1 = 1.173.

M2² = 1.173 / 0.835 ≈ 1.405.

M2 ≈ sqrt(1.405) ≈ 1.185.

Hmm, but this contradicts the expectation that M should increase if the pressure drops in a converging duct. Alternatively, perhaps the duct is diverging, leading to a decrease in M.

But perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me check again.

Wait, perhaps I should have used (P1/P2) instead of (P2/P1) in the exponent. Let me see.

The correct formula for the pressure ratio in isentropic flow is:

(P2/P1) = [ (1 + (γ/2) M1² ) / (1 + (γ/2) M2² ) ] ^ ( (γ-1)/γ )

So, taking both sides to the power of γ/(γ-1):

(P2/P1)^(γ/(γ-1)) = (1 + (γ/2) M1² ) / (1 + (γ/2) M2² )

Rearranging:

(1 + (γ/2) M2² ) = (1 + (γ/2) M1² ) / (P2/P1)^(γ/(γ-1)).

Ah, I think I made a mistake in the previous step by using (P2/P1)^( (γ-1)/γ ), but it should be (P2/P1) raised to (γ/(γ-1)).

So, let's correct that.

Given that γ=1.67, so γ/(γ-1)=1.67/0.67≈2.4925.

So,

(1 + (γ/2) M2² ) = (1 + (γ/2) M1² ) / (0.5)^(2.4925)

Compute (0.5)^(2.4925). Let's compute this accurately.

ln(0.5) = -0.6931.

So,

ln(0.5^2.4925) = 2.4925 * (-0.6931) ≈ -1.727.

Exponentiating, e^-1.727 ≈ 0.177.

So,

(1 + (γ/2) M2² ) = 2.87125 / 0.177 ≈ 16.243.

Then,

(γ/2) M2² = 16.243 - 1 = 15.243.

So,

M2² = 15.243 / (0.835) ≈ 18.26.

Thus,

M2 ≈ sqrt(18.26) ≈ 4.27.

Wait, that's way higher than any of the options. The options go up to 2.80. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Alternatively, perhaps using the table is the right way. Let me try that again.

We have (P0/P2)=2.64, looking for M where (P0/P)=2.64.

Looking at the table:

At M=2.75, (P0/P)=2.529.

At M=2.80, (P0/P)=2.616.

At M=2.85, (P0/P)=2.705.

So, 2.64 is between 2.529 and 2.616, which corresponds to M between 2.75 and 2.80.

But the options don't have a value between these, so perhaps the intended answer is 2.80 (option A), as it's the closest higher value.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the table. Let me look again.

Wait, perhaps I should use the relation between Mach numbers and pressure ratios directly.

Another approach: using the isentropic relation:

(P2/P1) = ( (1 + (γ/2) M1² ) / (1 + (γ/2) M2² ) ) ^ ( (γ-1)/γ )

We can take natural logs on both sides:

ln(P2/P1) = (γ-1)/γ * [ ln(1 + (γ/2) M1² ) - ln(1 + (γ/2) M2² ) ]

But this might not be helpful without iterative methods.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use the given table to find M2 where (P/P0) is 0.66 (since P2=15 and P1=30, and P1/P0=1.320, so P2/P0=0.66).

But looking at the table, (P/P0) decreases as M increases beyond 0. So, higher M leads to lower (P/P0).

Looking for (P/P0)=0.66.

Looking through the table, let's see:

At M=2.00, (P/P0)=1.530.

At M=2.50, (P/P0)=2.135.

Wait, that's higher than 1, which can't be right because at higher M, (P/P0) should be lower.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the table. Maybe the table lists (P0/P), the stagnation pressure over static pressure, which is greater than 1 for M>0.

So, if (P0/P)=2.64, as calculated earlier, then looking for M where (P0/P)=2.64.

Looking at the table:

At M=2.75, (P0/P)=2.529.

At M=2.80, (P0/P)=2.616.

At M=2.85, (P0/P)=2.705.

So, 2.64 is between M=2.80 and M=2.85.

But the options don't have a value between 2.80 and 2.85, so the closest option is A:2.80.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is E:2.05, but that seems too low. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, perhaps using the relation between pressure and Mach number more carefully.

We have:

(P2/P1) = [ (1 + (γ/2) M1² ) / (1 + (γ/2) M2² ) ] ^ ( (γ-1)/γ )

Taking both sides to the power of γ/(γ-1):

(P2/P1)^(- (γ-1)/γ ) = (1 + (γ/2) M1² ) / (1 + (γ/2) M2² )

So,

(1 + (γ/2) M2² ) = (1 + (γ/2) M1² ) * (P1/P2)^( (γ-1)/γ )

Plugging in the numbers:

P1/P2=2.

γ=1.67.

(γ-1)/γ ≈ 0.4012.

So,

(1 + (γ/2) M2² ) = (1 + (γ/2)(1.5)^2 ) * (2)^0.4012

Compute each part:

(γ/2) = 0.835.

M1^2=2.25.

So,

1 + (0.835 * 2.25) = 1 + 1.87125 = 2.87125.

Now, 2^0.4012 ≈ e^(0.4012 * ln2) ≈ e^(0.4012 * 0.6931) ≈ e^(0.277) ≈ 1.319.

So,

(1 + (γ/2) M2² ) ≈ 2.87125 * 1.319 ≈ 3.786.

Thus,

(γ/2) M2² ≈ 3.786 -1 = 2.786.

M2² ≈ 2.786 / 0.835 ≈ 3.34.

M2 ≈ sqrt(3.34) ≈ 1.828.

Hmm, that's about 1.83, which isn't exactly one of the options, but option D is 1.98, which is close. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the exponent.

Wait, I think I messed up the exponent signs. Let me recheck.

The correct formula after taking both sides to the power of γ/(γ-1) is:

(P2/P1)^(γ/(γ-1)) = (1 + (γ/2) M1² ) / (1 + (γ/2) M2² )

So,

1 + (γ/2) M2² = (1 + (γ/2) M1² ) / (P2/P1)^(γ/(γ-1)).

Which is:

(1 + (γ/2) M2² ) = (2.87125) / (0.5)^(2.4925).

As before, 0.5^2.4925 ≈ 0.177.

So,

1 + (γ/2) M2² ≈ 2.87125 / 0.177 ≈ 16.243.

Thus,

(γ/2) M2² ≈ 16.243 -1 =15.243.

M2² ≈ 15.243 / 0.835 ≈18.26.

M2≈4.27.

But that's way higher than the options given. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option E:2.05, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should try using the table again. Since (P0/P2)=2.64, and the table shows at M=2.80, (P0/P)=2.616, which is close to 2.64. So, perhaps M≈2.80.

Thus, the answer would be option A:2.80.

To determine the Mach number at the second point, we analyze the isentropic flow of helium through the channel. The given data includes the initial pressure \( P_1 = 30 \, \text{psia} \), initial Mach number \( M_1 = 1.5 \), and downstream pressure \( P_2 = 15 \, \text{psia} \). The goal is to find \( M_2 \), the Mach number at the second point.

### Key Relations and Approach:
1. **Isentropic Flow Relation**: For an isentropic process, the pressure ratio is related to the Mach number by:
   \[
   \frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left( \frac{1 + \frac{\gamma}{2} M_1^2}{1 + \frac{\gamma}{2} M_2^2} \right)^{\frac{\gamma - 1}{\gamma}}
   \]
   where \( \gamma = 1.67 \).

2. **Pressure Ratio**: The pressure ratio is:
   \[
   \frac{P_2}{P_1} = \frac{15}{30} = 0.5
   \]

3. **Rearranging the Formula**: Rearranging the isentropic relation to solve for \( M_2 \):
   \[
   1 + \frac{\gamma}{2} M_2^2 = \frac{1 + \frac{\gamma}{2} M_1^2}{\left( \frac{P_2}{P_1} \right)^{\frac{\gamma}{\gamma - 1}}}
   \]

4. **Substitute Values**:
   - \( \gamma = 1.67 \), \( M_1 = 1.5 \), \( \frac{P_2}{P_1} = 0.5 \)
   - Compute \( \frac{\gamma}{\gamma - 1} \approx 2.4925 \)
   - Compute \( \left( 0.5 \right)^{2.4925} \approx 0.177 \)
   - Compute \( 1 + \frac{\gamma}{2} M_1^2 = 1 + 0.835 \cdot (1.5)^2 = 2.87125 \)

5. **Solve for \( M_2 \)**:
   \[
   1 + \frac{\gamma}{2} M_2^2 = \frac{2.87125}{0.177} \approx 16.243
   \]
   \[
   \frac{\gamma}{2} M_2^2 = 16.243 - 1 = 15.243
   \]
   \[
   M_2^2 = \frac{15.243}{0.835} \approx 18.26
   \]
   \[
   M_2 \approx \sqrt{18.26} \approx 4.27
   \]

6. **Revisiting the Table**: Using the provided table, the stagnation pressure ratio \( P_0/P \) at \( M_2 \) is approximately \( 2.64 \). Comparing with the table:
   - At \( M = 2.80 \), \( P_0/P = 2.616 \)
   - At \( M = 2.85 \), \( P_0/P = 2.705 \)

   Since \( 2.64 \) lies between \( 2.616 \) and \( 2.705 \), \( M_2 \) is slightly above \( 2.80 \). However, the closest option provided is \( 2.80 \).

### Conclusion:
The Mach number at the second point is approximately \( 2.80 \), corresponding to **Option A**.
