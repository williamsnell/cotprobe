Answer:
    
<think>
Okay, so I've got this problem here about heat transfer in a gas mixture. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on thermodynamics, but I'll give it a shot.

First, the problem states that there's a mixture of nitrogen (N₂) and argon gas. The mole fractions are 0.4 and 0.6 respectively. The gas is flowing at a rate of 2500 lbm/hr. It goes through a heat exchanger where its temperature increases from 80°F to 450°F. The pressure is constant at 14.7 psia. I need to find the rate of heat addition.

Hmm, so I remember that when dealing with ideal gases, the heat transfer can be calculated using the formula Q = m * c_p * ΔT. But wait, since this is a mixture of gases, I think I should consider the mixture's specific heat at constant pressure, c_p mix.

Right, the specific heat of the mixture can be found using mole fractions. Oh, because for ideal gases, the specific heat is additive based on mole fractions. So, c_p mix = (x1 * c_p1) + (x2 * c_p2), where x is the mole fraction and c_p is the specific heat at constant pressure for each gas.

I need the c_p values for N₂ and argon. I think I remember that for diatomic gases like N₂, the c_p at constant pressure (in English units) is around 0.24 BTU/lbm°F. Wait, let me double-check. Oh, no, wait, I think I might be mixing up units. Wait, in imperial units, specific heat is often given in BTU per pound-mole per degree Fahrenheit, but sometimes also per lbm. Let me get this right.

Wait, alternatively, maybe it's better to use the specific heat in BTU/(lbm·°F). Let me look up the typical values. Oh wait, I'm just thinking; for nitrogen (N₂), which is a diatomic gas, the specific heat at constant pressure (c_p) is approximately 0.24 BTU per pound-mass per degree Fahrenheit (BTU/lbm°F). For argon (Ar), which is a monoatomic gas, c_p is higher. I think it's about 0.29 BTU/lbm°F. Wait, no, wait, that can't be right because I remember that monoatomic gases have higher specific heats than diatomic ones. Wait, no, wait, wait, let me think again.

Wait, wait, maybe I should check the standard values. For nitrogen, the specific heat at constant pressure is approximately 0.24 BTU/lbm·°F. For argon, it's about 0.29 BTU/lbm·°F. So, the mole fractions are 0.4 for N₂ and 0.6 for Ar.

So the mixture's c_p would be (0.4 * 0.24) + (0.6 * 0.29). Let me calculate that. 0.4 * 0.24 is 0.096, and 0.6 * 0.29 is 0.174. Adding them together gives 0.096 + 0.174 = 0.27 BTU/lbm·°F. So c_p mix is 0.27 BTU/lbm°F.

Wait, that seems a bit low. Let me think again. Oh wait, maybe I'm using the wrong values. Another way to remember: the specific heat of air (which is mostly N₂ and O₂) is about 0.24 BTU/lbm·°F at constant pressure. So maybe N₂ is around 0.24, and Ar being heavier and monoatomic, perhaps a bit higher, like 0.29. Wait, but I'm not 100% sure, but for the sake of this problem, I'll go with these values.

So, the temperature change ΔT is from 80°F to 450°F, which is 450 - 80 = 370°F. So ΔT is 370°F.

Now, the mass flow rate is 2500 lbm/hr. So, putting it all together, the heat transfer rate Q is mass flow rate * c_p mix * ΔT.

Calculating that: Q = 2500 lbm/hr * 0.27 BTU/(lbm·°F) * 370°F.

Let me compute the numbers. First, 0.27 * 370 = let's see: 0.27 * 300 = 81, 0.27 *70= 18.9, so total 99.9 BTU/lbm.

Then, 2500 * 99.9 = let's compute that. 2500 * 100 is 250,000, but 2500 * (100 - 0.1) = 250,000 - 250 = 249,750 BTU/hr.

Wait, but looking at the options, the closest is option E:210000 Btu/hr, but wait, maybe I made a mistake in the specific heat values.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the specific heats. Wait, maybe I'm confusing specific heat at constant volume (c_v) with c_p. Let me think again. For an ideal gas, c_p = c_v + R. At standard conditions, for nitrogen, R is about 0.2969 BTU/lbm·°R (since R = 1716 ft·lbf/(lbm·°R) converted to BTU, it's approximately 0.2969 BTU/lbm·°F because °R and °F have the same magnitude here). Wait, but that might vary based on units.

Wait, perhaps I should look up the correct c_p values for N₂ and Ar in BTU/lbm·°F.

Alternatively, maybe I can find the specific heat using the degrees of freedom. For diatomic gases like N₂, the degrees of freedom are 5 (3 translational, 2 rotational), so c_v = (5/2) R. Similarly, for monoatomic gases like Ar, c_v = (3/2) R.

But R here is in BTU/lbm·°F. Let me calculate R. The universal gas constant R is 8.314 J/(mol·K), but converting that to BTU/lbm·°F.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to use tabulated values. Let me think, for nitrogen, c_p is approximately 0.24 BTU/lbm·°F, and for argon, c_p is around 0.29 BTU/lbm·°F. So maybe I was correct earlier.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider the specific heats in terms of the mean molecular weight of the mixture. Wait, but I'm not sure if that's necessary here. Let me proceed with the initial calculation.

So, Q = 2500 * 0.27 * 370 = 2500 * 99.9 = 249,750 BTU/hr. But looking at the options, none of them are exactly 249,750. The closest is option E: 210,000, but that's lower. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the specific heat values.

Wait, perhaps I should check the specific heat values again. Alternatively, perhaps the heat capacity should be calculated using the mixture's average molar mass. Wait, maybe I'm missing something about the units.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I should calculate the mass-specific heat correctly. Let me think about the process.

Wait, another thought: when dealing with gases, especially ideal gases, the heat capacity can be calculated using the degrees of freedom. Nitrogen has 5 degrees of freedom (3 translational, 2 rotational), so c_v = (5/2) R. Argon has 3 degrees (translational only), so c_v = (3/2) R.

But R in BTU/lbm·°F is what I need. Let me compute R in those units.

The universal gas constant R is 8.314 J/(mol·K). To convert to BTU/lbm·°F, note that 1 J = 0.00094725 BTU, and 1 K = 1 °F in terms of absolute temperature changes (since they're intervals). Also, 1 mol is equal to molar mass in kg, but perhaps I'm complicating things.

Alternatively, perhaps I can look up the value of R in BTU/lbm·°F. Wait, I think R is approximately 0.2969 BTU/lbm·°F for nitrogen. Wait, no, that's c_p for nitrogen. Wait, no, perhaps I'm mixing things up.

Wait, perhaps I can find the specific heat using the molar mass. Let's see: for nitrogen, molar mass M_N2 is 28 g/mol (28 lbm per mole, since 1 lbm is about 453.592 grams, but maybe this is getting too involved).

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use the specific heat from tables. Let me think; I recall that for nitrogen, c_p is about 0.24 BTU/lbm·°F, and for argon, it's about 0.29 BTU/lbm·°F. So, using these values, the mixture's c_p is (0.4*0.24)+(0.6*0.29) = 0.096 + 0.174 = 0.27 BTU/lbm·°F.

So, with that, the calculation is correct. So, Q = 2500 * 0.27 * 370 = 249,750 BTU/hr.

Looking at the options, the closest is option A:151,466.45, but that's way off. Hmmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the specific heat values. Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses different values.

Wait, maybe I inverted the mole fractions. Wait, no, the mole fraction of N2 is 0.4 and Ar is 0.6. So that's correct.

Wait, another thought: maybe the problem expects the use of the specific heat at constant pressure in BTU/(lbm·°R) instead of °F. But since °F and °R have the same magnitude for changes, it shouldn't matter because ΔT would be same in both scales. So that's probably not the issue.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recompute the numbers.

0.27 * 370 = 99.9 BTU/lbm.

Then, 2500 lbm/hr * 99.9 BTU/lbm = 2500 * 99.9 = 249,750 BTU/hr.

But the options don't have this value. The closest higher option is J: 165,000, but that's lower. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should check if the specific heat values are per mole or per lbm. Oh wait, that's a possibility. Because if the c_p values are given per mole, I would need to adjust for the molar mass.

Wait, that's a crucial point. If the specific heat values I'm using are in BTU per mole per °F, I need to convert them to BTU per lbm per °F by dividing by the molar mass.

Ah, that's probably where I went wrong. So, let me recalculate using this approach.

So, for nitrogen (N₂), molar mass M_N2 = 28 lbm/mol (since 28 g/mol is 0.062 lbm/mol; wait, no, wait: 1 kg is 2.2046 lbm, so 28 g is 0.062 lbm, so 1 mole of N₂ is 28 lbm? No, wait, that can't be right. Wait, 1 mole of N₂ is 28 grams, which is 0.062 lbm (since 1 lbm is about 453.592 grams). So, 28 grams is 0.062 lbm.

Similarly, argon (Ar) has a molar mass of about 39.948 g/mol, which is approximately 0.088 lbm/mol.

Wait, so if the specific heat is given per mole, I need to convert it to per lbm by dividing by the molar mass.

So, let's get the correct c_p values per mole first.

For nitrogen, c_p (N₂) is approximately 0.24 BTU/(mol·°F). Wait, no, wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. Actually, the specific heat capacity per mole for N₂ would be higher because it's per mole. Let me look up the correct c_p for N₂ and Ar in BTU per mole per °F.

Wait, I think for N₂, c_p is about 0.24 BTU/(mol·°F), but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the molar heat capacities from standard tables.

Wait, standard molar heat capacity at constant pressure for nitrogen (N₂) is about 29.12 kJ/(mol·K), which is 29.12 * 1000 J/(mol·K) = 29,120 J/(mol·K). Convert that to BTU/(mol·°F):

Since 1 J = 0.00094725 BTU, so 29,120 J = 29,120 * 0.00094725 ≈ 27.58 BTU/mol·K. Since ΔT in °F and °K have the same magnitude for intervals, so 27.58 BTU/(mol·°F).

Similarly, for argon (Ar), c_p is about 20.85 kJ/(mol·K) = 20,850 J/(mol·K) = 20,850 * 0.00094725 ≈ 19.76 BTU/(mol·°F).

So, now, to get specific heat per lbm, I divide by the molar mass in lbm/mol.

For N₂: M_N2 = 28 g/mol = 0.062 lbm/mol. So, c_p (lbm⁻¹·°F⁻¹) = 27.58 BTU/(mol·°F) / 0.062 lbm/mol ≈ 444.84 BTU/(lbm·°F). That can't be right because that's way too high. Wait, that must be wrong because earlier I thought it was 0.24 BTU/lbm·°F. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up molar heat capacity and specific heat. Let me clarify.

The specific heat capacity (c_p) is the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of a unit mass of a substance by one degree Fahrenheit. If I have the molar heat capacity (C_p), which is per mole, then to get c_p in BTU/(lbm·°F), I can calculate it as C_p (BTU/(mol·°F)) divided by the molar mass in lbm/mol.

So, for nitrogen: C_p (mol⁻¹) is approximately 29.12 kJ/(mol·K) which is 29.12 * 1000 J/(mol·K) = 29,120 J/(mol·K). Convert to BTU: 29,120 J = 29,120 * 0.00094725 ≈ 27.58 BTU/(mol·°F).

Molar mass M_N2 = 28 g/mol = 0.062 lbm/mol.

So, c_p for N₂ is 27.58 BTU/(mol·°F) / 0.062 lbm/mol ≈ 444.84 BTU/(lbm·°F). But that's way too high, and I know that's not correct because earlier I thought it was around 0.24 BTU/lbm·°F. So I must have made a mistake in the conversion.

Wait a minute, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the molar mass conversion. Let me double-check: 1 lbm = 453.592 grams. So, 28 grams is 28 / 453.592 ≈ 0.0617 lbm/mol. So, that's correct. But if C_p (molar) is 29.12 kJ/(mol·K), which is 29,120 J/(mol·K), that's 29,120 J per mole per degree Kelvin. Converting to BTU, that's 29,120 * 0.00094725 ≈ 27.58 BTU/(mol·°F). So dividing by 0.0617 lbm/mol gives 27.58 / 0.0617 ≈ 447 BTU/(lbm·°F). That's way higher than expected.

Wait, that can't be right because I know that the specific heat for nitrogen is around 0.24 BTU/lbm·°F. So perhaps I'm using the wrong value for C_p in the first place.

Wait, perhaps I should use the specific heat in imperial units correctly. Let me look up the specific heat of nitrogen in BTU/lbm·°F. From what I recall, nitrogen has a specific heat of approximately 0.24 BTU/lbm·°F at constant pressure. Similarly, argon has a specific heat of about 0.29 BTU/lbm·°F. So perhaps I should use these values directly without worrying about molar masses because they are already specific to lbm.

In that case, the mixture's c_p is (0.4 * 0.24) + (0.6 * 0.29) = 0.096 + 0.174 = 0.27 BTU/lbm·°F.

So, with that, the calculation is:

Q = 2500 lbm/hr * 0.27 BTU/lbm·°F * (450 - 80) °F.

ΔT = 450 - 80 = 370°F.

So, Q = 2500 * 0.27 * 370.

Compute 0.27 * 370 first: 0.27 * 300 = 81, 0.27 *70=18.9; total is 81 + 18.9 = 99.9.

Then, 2500 * 99.9 = 249,750 BTU/hr.

Looking at the options, the closest is option A:151,466.45, but that's way lower. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the specific heat values.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem expects the use of the mean specific heat at constant pressure considering the degrees of freedom. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the average molar mass and then compute the specific heat.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the use of the specific heat in BTU/(lbm·°R) and since the pressure is constant, using R as the gas constant in those units.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the enthalpy change. Since it's an ideal gas, the heat added is the change in enthalpy, which is Q = m * (h2 - h1). And for ideal gases, the change in enthalpy depends only on temperature, so Δh = c_p * ΔT.

So, perhaps I should proceed as before.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is using the specific heat in BTU/(lbm·°R) instead of °F. But since the temperature change is the same in both scales, it wouldn't affect the calculation. So that's probably not the issue.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the calculation using the mean specific heat of the mixture, but maybe I'm using the wrong approach. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the molar mass to adjust the heat capacity.

Wait, maybe I should compute the molar mass of the mixture first. The mole fraction of N₂ is 0.4 and Ar is 0.6.

Molar mass of N₂ is 28 g/mol, Ar is 40 g/mol (approx). So, average molar mass M_mix = (0.4 * 28) + (0.6 * 40) = 11.2 + 24 = 35.2 g/mol = 0.0777 lbm/mol.

Then, the specific gas constant R for the mixture is R_mix = R / M_mix, where R is the universal gas constant in appropriate units.

Wait, R is 8.314 kJ/(kmol·K) = 8.314 * 10^3 J/(10^3 mol·K) = 8.314 J/(mol·K). But I need R in BTU/(lbm·°F).

Let me compute R in BTU/(lbm·°F).

We know that R = 8.314 J/(mol·K).

Convert J to BTU: 8.314 J = 8.314 * 0.00094725 BTU ≈ 0.00788 BTU.

Now, convert mol to lbm: 1 mol of the mixture is M_mix = 35.2 g/mol = 0.0777 lbm/mol.

So, R_mix = R / M_mix = 0.00788 BTU/(mol·K) / 0.0777 lbm/mol ≈ 0.00788 / 0.0777 ≈ 0.1014 BTU/(lbm·K).

Since ΔT in K is the same as in °F for intervals, R_mix ≈ 0.1014 BTU/(lbm·°F).

Now, for ideal gases, c_p = (f/2) * R_mix, where f is the degrees of freedom. Wait, no, that's for c_v. Wait, for ideal gases, c_p = c_v + R.

But for diatomic gases like N₂, c_v = (5/2) R_mix, so c_p = (5/2) R_mix + R_mix = (7/2) R_mix = 3.5 R_mix.

For monoatomic gases like Ar, c_v = (3/2) R_mix, so c_p = (3/2) R_mix + R_mix = (5/2) R_mix = 2.5 R_mix.

Wait, but I'm not sure if this approach is correct because the specific heat is mixture-dependent.

Alternatively, perhaps for the mixture, the average c_p can be calculated based on the mole fractions and their degrees of freedom.

So, for the mixture, the mole fraction of N₂ is 0.4, which has 5 degrees of freedom (3 translational, 2 rotational), and Ar is 0.6 with 3 degrees of freedom.

The average c_p would be:

c_p mix = (x1 * (f1/2) * R) + (x2 * (f2/2) * R) ) + R_mix ?

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute the average c_p using the mole fractions and the specific heat contributions from each gas.

Wait, no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try this approach:

For each gas, compute their c_p in BTU/(lbm·°F), then take the mole-fraction-weighted average.

As earlier, for N₂, c_p is 0.24 BTU/lbm·°F, and for Ar, it's 0.29 BTU/lbm·°F.

So, the mixture's c_p is 0.4*0.24 + 0.6*0.29 = 0.096 + 0.174 = 0.27 BTU/lbm·°F.

So, using this, Q = 2500 * 0.27 * 370 = 249,750 BTU/hr.

But the options don't have this value. The closest is option A:151,466.45, which is about half of that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check the math again.

0.27 * 370 = 99.9 BTU/lbm.

2500 * 99.9 = 249,750 BTU/hr.

Hmm, but the options don't include this. Maybe I should check the initial approach again.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the use of the specific heat at constant pressure in BTU/(lbm·°R) and without considering the mole fractions correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the specific heat of air as a reference, assuming air has a similar composition. But air's c_p is around 0.24 BTU/lbm·°F, but our mixture has a higher c_p due to more argon.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the specific heat values I'm using are incorrect. Let me look up the correct specific heats for N₂ and Ar in BTU/lbm·°F.

Upon checking, nitrogen (N₂) has a specific heat at constant pressure of approximately 0.24 BTU/lbm·°F, and argon (Ar) has a specific heat of approximately 0.29 BTU/lbm·°F. So, my initial approach was correct.

So, the calculation leads to 249,750 BTU/hr, but none of the options match. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the mole fractions or the temperature change.

Wait, the temperature change is from 80°F to 450°F, which is 370°F, correct.

Mass flow rate is 2500 lbm/hr.

Hmm, perhaps the options are using a different value for c_p. Let me see: if c_p mix were 0.2 BTU/lbm·°F, then Q would be 2500 * 0.2 * 370 = 2500 * 74 = 185,000 BTU/hr. That's close to option F:180,000.

Alternatively, if c_p were 0.25, then Q would be 2500 * 0.25 * 370 = 2500 * 92.5 = 231,250, which is not an option.

Wait, maybe I should compute using the molar basis. Let me try that approach.

Mass flow rate is 2500 lbm/hr. Molar mass of the mixture is (0.4 * 28 + 0.6 * 40) g/mol = 0.4*28=11.2, 0.6*40=24; total 35.2 g/mol = 0.0777 lbm/mol.

So, moles per hour: 2500 lbm/hr / 0.0777 lbm/mol ≈ 32,160 mol/hr.

Molar heat capacity for N₂: c_p (N₂) = 29.12 kJ/(mol·K) = 29.12 * 1000 J/(mol·K) = 29,120 J/(mol·K) = 29,120 * 0.00094725 ≈ 27.58 BTU/(mol·°F).

Similarly, for Ar: c_p (Ar) = 20.85 kJ/(mol·K) ≈ 19.76 BTU/(mol·°F).

So, the molar heat capacity of the mixture is:

c_p mix (mol⁻¹) = 0.4 * 27.58 + 0.6 * 19.76 ≈ 11.03 + 11.856 ≈ 22.886 BTU/(mol·°F).

Then, the total heat transfer is:

Q = n * c_p mix * ΔT = 32,160 mol/hr * 22.886 BTU/(mol·°F) * 370°F.

Calculate 22.886 * 370 ≈ 8,470 BTU/mol.

Then, 32,160 mol/hr * 8,470 BTU/mol ≈ 272,  let me compute that: 32,160 * 8,470 = ?

Wait, 32,160 * 8,470 = let me compute step by step.

32,160 * 8,000 = 257,280,000 BTU/hr.

32,160 * 470 = ?

32,160 * 400 = 12,864,000.

32,160 *70= 2,251,200.

Total: 12,864,000 + 2,251,200 = 15,115,200.

So, total Q ≈ 257,280,000 + 15,115,200 = 272,395,200 BTU/hr. That's way higher than any of the options, so this approach must be incorrect.

Wait, that can't be right because that's way too high. I must have made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps I should not be using the molar basis because the specific heat per lbm is more appropriate here. So, going back, my initial calculation of 249,750 BTU/hr seems correct, but since it's not an option, perhaps the problem expects a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the use of the mean specific heat without considering the mole fractions. Alternatively, maybe I should use the specific heat of air, which is about 0.24 BTU/lbm·°F, but that would give:

Q = 2500 * 0.24 * 370 = 2500 * 88.8 = 222,000 BTU/hr. That's close to option F:180,000, but not exact.

Wait, perhaps the specific heat values are different. Let me think again. Maybe N₂ is 0.24 and Ar is 0.29. So, the mixture is 0.27 BTU/lbm·°F. So, 2500 * 0.27 * 370 = 249,750.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses c_p in BTU/(lbm·°R), but since ΔT is same in °F and °R, it shouldn't matter.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the specific heat at constant volume instead of pressure, but that's unlikely because the process is at constant pressure.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem expects the use of the ideal gas law to find the specific volume and then compute heat using enthalpy changes.

Wait, let me try that approach.

The ideal gas law is PV = mRT. At constant pressure, the specific volume v = RT/P.

The change in enthalpy for an ideal gas is Δh = c_p ΔT.

So, the heat transfer Q = m * c_p * ΔT.

Which is what I did earlier. So, I think my initial approach is correct.

Given that, perhaps the options are incorrect, or perhaps I made a mistake in the specific heat values.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the use of the specific heat in BTU/(lbm·°R) without considering the mole fractions, but that's unclear.

Wait, perhaps I should check the options again. The options are:

A: 151466.45

B:175000

C:135000

D:200000

E:210000

F:180000

G:160000

H:120000

I:190000

J:165000

Hmm, 249,750 isn't there, but option B is 175,000, which is about (249,750 * 0.7). Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the mole fractions. Let me check the mole fractions again.

The mole fraction of N₂ is 0.4, Ar is 0.6. So, c_p mix = 0.4*0.24 + 0.6*0.29 = 0.096 + 0.174 = 0.27. That's correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses the specific heat in BTU/(lbm·°R) and the temperature change is in Kelvin. But 370°F is equal to 370 + 459.67 = 829.67°F, which is 829.67 - 459.67 = 370°F, same as before. So, no effect.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses the specific heat in BTU/(lbm·°F) but for the wrong gases. For example, perhaps it's using air's specific heat, which is around 0.24 BTU/lbm·°F. If I use 0.24, then Q = 2500 * 0.24 * 370 = 2500 * 88.8 = 222,000 BTU/hr. Not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the specific heat is 0.25 BTU/lbm·°F. Then, Q = 2500 * 0.25 * 370 = 2500 * 92.5 = 231,250. Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses the specific heat in BTU/(lbm·°R) and without considering the mole fractions. Let me try that approach.

Wait, but I think I'm stuck. My calculation leads to 249,750 BTU/hr, which isn't among the options. The closest option is A:151,466.45, but that's way off. Perhaps I made a mistake in the specific heat values.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the specific heat of N₂ is 0.24 BTU/lbm·°R and Ar is 0.29 BTU/lbm·°R. Then, the calculation would be same as before, 0.27 BTU/lbm·°F. So, same result.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the use of the specific heat at constant volume, c_v, instead of c_p. But that would be incorrect because the process is at constant pressure.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the use of the average specific heat without considering the mole fractions, but that would also be incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the use of the mean specific heat without the mole fractions, so 0.24 + 0.29 = 0.53, but that's not correct either.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the temperature change. Wait, 450 - 80 = 370°F. Correct.

Hmm, perhaps I should look for an option that is approximately 250,000 BTU/hr. But none of the options are close. So maybe I made a mistake in the specific heat values.

Wait, perhaps the specific heat for Ar is 0.29 BTU/lbm·°F, but for N₂ it's 0.24. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the specific heat in J/(kg·K) and convert to BTU/(lbm·°F).

Let me try that. For N₂, c_p is 1.04 kJ/(kg·K) = 1040 J/(kg·K). Convert to BTU/(lbm·°F):

1040 J/(kg·K) = 1040 * 0.00094725 BTU/(lbm·°F) ≈ 0.985 BTU/(lbm·°F).

Similarly, for Ar, c_p is 0.5203 kJ/(kg·K) = 520.3 J/(kg·K) = 520.3 * 0.00094725 ≈ 0.493 BTU/(lbm·°F).

Wait, but that seems way off from the earlier values. So, using these:

c_p mix = 0.4 * 0.985 + 0.6 * 0.493 ≈ 0.394 + 0.296 ≈ 0.69 BTU/lbm·°F.

Then, Q = 2500 * 0.69 * 370 ≈ 2500 * 255.3 ≈ 638,250 BTU/hr, which is way too high and not matching any options.

Hmm, I'm getting confused. Perhaps I should stick with the initial approach and consider that the correct answer isn't listed, but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses the specific heat in BTU/(lbm·°F) without considering the mole fractions, using an average of 0.265 BTU/lbm·°F. Then, Q = 2500 * 0.265 * 370 = 2500 * 98.05 ≈ 245,125 BTU/hr. Still not matching options.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses the specific heat of air, which is about 0.24 BTU/lbm·°F, leading to Q = 2500 * 0.24 * 370 = 222,000 BTU/hr. Closest option is F:180,000, but not exact.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the use of the mean specific heat as (0.24 + 0.29)/2 = 0.265, leading to Q = 2500 * 0.265 * 370 = 245,125. Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the mole fractions. The problem states 0.4 mole fraction of N₂ and 0.6 of Ar. That's correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses the specific heat in BTU/(lbm·°R) and without considering the mole fractions. Let me try using 0.24 for N₂ and 0.29 for Ar, but without weighting by mole fractions, which would be incorrect, but let's see:

c_p mix = 0.24 + 0.29 = 0.53 BTU/lbm·°F. Then, Q = 2500 * 0.53 * 370 = 2500 * 196.1 = 490,250. Not matching.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Given the options, perhaps the intended answer is option A:151,466.45, but I don't see how that would come about. Alternatively, perhaps the specific heat values are different. Maybe N₂ is 0.24 and Ar is 0.29, but the mole fractions are swapped. Let me try that.

If mole fractions were 0.6 N₂ and 0.4 Ar, then c_p mix = 0.6*0.24 + 0.4*0.29 = 0.144 + 0.116 = 0.26 BTU/lbm·°F.

Then, Q = 2500 * 0.26 * 370 = 2500 * 96.2 = 240,500 BTU/hr. Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses c_p in BTU/(lbm·°F) as 0.24 for both gases, leading to c_p mix = 0.24. Then, Q = 2500 * 0.24 * 370 = 222,000. Not matching.

Wait, perhaps the problem intended to use the specific heat in J/(kg·K) and forgot to convert units properly. Let me try that.

For N₂: c_p = 1.039 kJ/(kg·K) = 1.039e3 J/kg·K. Convert to BTU/(lbm·°F):

1.039e3 J/kg·K = 1.039e3 * 0.00094725 BTU/(lbm·°F) ≈ 0.984 BTU/(lbm·°F).

For Ar: c_p = 0.5203 kJ/(kg·K) = 520.3 J/kg·K = 520.3 * 0.00094725 ≈ 0.493 BTU/(lbm·°F).

Then, c_p mix = 0.4 * 0.984 + 0.6 * 0.493 ≈ 0.3936 + 0.2958 ≈ 0.6894 BTU/lbm·°F.

Then, Q = 2500 * 0.6894 * 370 ≈ 2500 * 254.078 ≈ 635,195 BTU/hr. Not matching options.

I think I've tried all possible approaches, and my initial calculation seems correct, but since it's not among the options, perhaps I made a mistake in the specific heat values. Given the options, the closest I can get is option A:151,466.45, but I don't see how that would result. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but I suspect that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the problem uses the specific heat in BTU/(lbm·°F) as 0.24 for both gases, giving c_p mix = 0.24. Then, Q = 2500 * 0.24 * 370 = 222,000. Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the use of the specific heat without considering the mole fractions, just taking an average of 0.265, leading to 245,125, but that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the problem expects the answer in BTU/s or another unit, but the options are in BTU/hr, so that's probably not it.

In conclusion, despite my best efforts, I can't find a way to get one of the provided options. However, the correct calculation based on the given data leads to approximately 249,750 BTU/hr, which isn't listed. Therefore, perhaps I made a mistake in the specific heat values. Alternatively, the intended answer might be option A:151,466.45, but I can't see how that would be achieved with the given data.

To determine the rate of heat addition for the gas mixture, the heat transfer equation for an ideal gas at constant pressure is used:

\[
Q = \dot{m} \cdot c_p^{\text{mix}} \cdot \Delta T
\]

### Step 1: Specific Heat of the Mixture
The specific heat of the mixture, \( c_p^{\text{mix}} \), is calculated using the mole fractions and the specific heats of the individual gases:

\[
c_p^{\text{mix}} = (x_{\text{N}_2} \cdot c_p^{\text{N}_2}) + (x_{\text{Ar}} \cdot c_p^{\text{Ar}})
\]

Given:
- \( x_{\text{N}_2} = 0.4 \), \( c_p^{\text{N}_2} = 0.24 \, \text{BTU/lbm}^\circ\text{F} \)
- \( x_{\text{Ar}} = 0.6 \), \( c_p^{\text{Ar}} = 0.29 \, \text{BTU/lbm}^\circ\text{F} \)

\[
c_p^{\text{mix}} = (0.4 \cdot 0.24) + (0.6 \cdot 0.29) = 0.096 + 0.174 = 0.27 \, \text{BTU/lbm}^\circ\text{F}
\]

### Step 2: Temperature Change
The temperature change is:

\[
\Delta T = T_2 - T_1 = 450^\circ\text{F} - 80^\circ\text{F} = 370^\circ\text{F}
\]

### Step 3: Heat Transfer Rate
The mass flow rate is given as \( \dot{m} = 2500 \, \text{lbm/hr} \). Substituting into the heat transfer equation:

\[
Q = 2500 \cdot 0.27 \cdot 370 = 2500 \cdot 99.9 = 249,750 \, \text{BTU/hr}
\]

### Step 4: Comparison with Options
The calculated heat transfer rate of \( 249,750 \, \text{BTU/hr} \) does not match any of the provided options. The closest option is **A: 151,466.45 BTU/hr**, but this value is significantly lower than the calculated result. Despite multiple attempts to verify the specific heat values and calculations, the discrepancy remains unresolved.

### Conclusion
Based on the given data and calculations, the correct heat transfer rate is approximately \( 249,750 \, \text{BTU/hr} \). However, since this value is not listed among the options, the most reasonable choice from the provided list is:

**A: 151,466.45 BTU/hr**
