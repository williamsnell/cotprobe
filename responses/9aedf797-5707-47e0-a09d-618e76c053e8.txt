Question:

Air flows through a pipe 5 ft. long with an internal diameter of 0.5 in. The air is flowing at a uniform speed of 80 ft/sec. The wall surface temperature is maintained at 210°F. If air enters at a temperature of 60°F and at atmospheric pressure, calculate the coefficient of heat transfer.

Options:

A: 20.4 Btu/hr-ft^2-°F
B: 17.1 Btu/hr-ft^2-°F
C: 15.2 Btu/hr-ft^2-°F
D: 18.6 Btu/hr-ft^2-°F

Answer:
    
<think>
Okay, so I've got this heat transfer problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

The problem says that air is flowing through a pipe that's 5 feet long with an internal diameter of 0.5 inches. The air speed is 80 feet per second, and the wall surface temperature is 210°F. The air enters at 60°F and atmospheric pressure. I need to find the coefficient of heat transfer, which I think is the convective heat transfer coefficient, usually denoted as h.

The options given are A to D, each with a value in Btu/hr-ft²-°F. So the answer will be one of these numbers.

Hmm, I remember that the convective heat transfer coefficient depends on factors like the flow velocity, the properties of the fluid (air in this case), and the geometry of the pipe. I think the formula I should use is Newton's Law of Cooling, which is Q = h A (T_s - T_f), where Q is the heat transfer rate, h is the coefficient, A is the surface area, and T_s and T_f are the surface and fluid temperatures, respectively.

But wait, I might need to calculate h using some other method because I don't have h yet. Oh right, for convective heat transfer, we often use the Dittus-Boelter equation, which is applicable for turbulent flow in pipes. The equation is h = (0.023 * Re^0.8 * Pr^(1/3)) * (k / D), where Re is the Reynolds number, Pr is the Prandtl number, k is the thermal conductivity, and D is the diameter of the pipe.

First, I need to check if the flow is laminar or turbulent because the Dittus-Boelter equation is only valid for turbulent flow. The Reynolds number (Re) determines that. The formula for Re is (v * D * rho) / mu, where v is velocity, D is diameter, rho is density, and mu is dynamic viscosity.

But wait, the pipe is relatively small, with a diameter of 0.5 inches, which is 0.5/12 = 0.04167 feet. The length is 5 feet, but I don't think length affects Re directly, just the diameter, velocity, and properties.

So, I need to find the air's properties at the given conditions. The air is entering at 60°F, but the wall temperature is 210°F. I'm not sure if I should use the entering temperature or an average temperature. Since the pipe is long and the temperature might vary along its length, but maybe for this calculation, I can assume the air's properties are evaluated at the entering temperature because the temperature change might be small over the 5 feet, or perhaps the problem expects us to use the entering conditions.

Wait, but I think the correct approach is to use the average temperature of the air and the wall. The wall is at 210°F, and the air is entering at 60°F. So the average would be (210 + 60)/2 = 135°F. But wait, that might not be necessary if the temperature doesn't change much along the pipe. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the entering temperature because the velocity is uniform, so maybe the temperature variation isn't too significant. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. Maybe I should proceed with the entering temperature and see if that makes sense.

Wait, but let me think: the air is flowing through the pipe, so it's going to heat up as it goes along. But the pipe is 5 feet long. How much will the air temperature change? If the flow is at 80 ft/s, the time spent in the pipe is delta_t = 5 / 80 = 0.0625 seconds. Since air has a specific heat and heat transfer rate, maybe the temperature rise is minimal, so using the entering temperature is acceptable. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the entering conditions because the data given is at the inlet. I think I'll proceed with the entering temperature of 60°F.

Wait no, wait. The Dittus-Boelter equation is based on the fluid properties at the bulk temperature, which in this case is the entering temperature. So I should use 60°F for the fluid properties.

Wait, but the wall is at 210°F, which is much higher, so the air will be heating up as it flows. But maybe for the purpose of calculating h, the properties are taken at the fluid's bulk temperature, which is 60°F here. Alternatively, sometimes people take an average, but I think for the Dittus-Boelter equation, it's the bulk temperature we're using. So let's proceed with 60°F for air properties.

Now, I need to find the properties of air at 60°F. Let me recall or look up the properties.

At 60°F (which is 18.3°C), the density of air is approximately 0.0769 lbm/cu ft. The viscosity, mu, is around 3.84 x 10^-7 lb-sec/ft². The thermal conductivity, k, is about 0.0148 Btu/hr-ft-°F. The specific heat at constant pressure, c_p, is approximately 0.24 Btu/lbm-°F. The Prandtl number, Pr, is usually around 0.7 for air.

Wait, let me get exact values to avoid errors. Alternatively, I can use more precise data. Let me think: at 60°F, air's properties are:

- Density (rho) ≈ 0.0769 lbm/ft³
- Viscosity (mu) ≈ 3.84 x 10^-7 lb·s/ft²
- Thermal conductivity (k) ≈ 0.0148 Btu/(hr·ft·°F)
- Specific heat (c_p) ≈ 0.24 Btu/(lbm·°F)
- Prandtl number (Pr) ≈ 0.707

Now, the diameter D is 0.5 inches, which is 0.5/12 = 0.04167 ft.

Velocity v is 80 ft/s.

First, calculate the Reynolds number Re:

Re = (v * D * rho) / mu

Plugging in the numbers:

Re = (80 ft/s * 0.04167 ft * 0.0769 lbm/ft³) / (3.84e-7 lb·s/ft²)

Wait, let me compute numerator and denominator separately.

Numerator: v * D * rho = 80 * 0.04167 * 0.0769

80 * 0.04167 ≈ 3.3336

3.3336 * 0.0769 ≈ 0.2565 lbm/s·ft²

Denominator: mu = 3.84e-7 lb·s/ft²

So Re = (0.2565) / (3.84e-7) = ?

0.2565 / 3.84e-7 = 0.2565 / 0.000000384 ≈ 667,600.

Wait, that's a high Reynolds number. Let me check the calculation again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in units. Let me confirm:

Re = (v * D * rho) / mu

v = 80 ft/s

D = 0.04167 ft

rho = 0.0769 lbm/ft³

mu = 3.84e-7 lb·s/ft²

So:

v * D = 80 * 0.04167 ≈ 3.3336 ft²/s

Then, rho * that = 0.0769 lbm/ft³ * 3.3336 ft²/s = 0.0769 * 3.3336 ≈ 0.2564 lbm/(ft·s)

Wait, but the numerator is (v * D * rho) = 80 * 0.04167 * 0.0769 = let me compute it step by step.

80 * 0.04167 = 3.3336 (ft²/s)

3.3336 * 0.0769 ≈ 0.2564 lbm/(ft·s)

Wait, no. Let me think again. The units: v is in ft/s, D in ft, rho in lbm/ft³.

So, v * D is (ft/s) * ft = ft²/s.

Then, rho is lbm/ft³, so multiplying by rho gives (ft²/s) * (lbm/ft³) = lbm/(ft·s).

So, the numerator is 80 * 0.04167 * 0.0769 = 80 * 0.04167 = 3.3336. Then 3.3336 * 0.0769 ≈ 0.2564 lbm/(ft·s).

Denominator is mu = 3.84e-7 lb·s/ft².

So Re = (0.2564 lbm/(ft·s)) / (3.84e-7 lb·s/ft²) )

Wait, the units: lbm/(ft·s) divided by (lb·s/ft²) gives (lbm/(ft·s)) * (ft²/(lb·s)) ) = lbm·ft/(lb·s²) ) → but actually, I think the units should simplify to dimensionless.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the value numerically.

So, Re = (0.2564) / (3.84e-7) = 0.2564 / 0.000000384 ≈ 667,361.

Wow, that's a high Reynolds number. So Re ≈ 667,000, which is well above 2100, so the flow is definitely turbulent. That means the Dittus-Boelter equation is applicable.

Now, the Dittus-Boelter equation for h is:

h = (0.023 * Re^0.8 * Pr^(1/3)) * (k / D)

So, let's compute each part.

First, Re^0.8: 667,361^0.8.

Let me compute that. I can take the natural log, multiply by 0.8, then exponentiate.

ln(667361) ≈ 13.398.

13.398 * 0.8 ≈ 10.7184.

e^10.7184 ≈ e^10 is about 22026, e^10.7184 is higher.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to use a calculator approach, but since I don't have a calculator, I'll make an approximation.

Alternatively, I can use logarithms or exponents.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute 667,361^0.8 as follows:

667,361 = 6.67361e5.

So, (6.67361e5)^0.8 = (6.67361)^0.8 * (1e5)^0.8.

(1e5)^0.8 = (1e5)^(4/5) = (1e5)^0.8 ≈ 1e4, because 1e5^0.8 = (1e4)^1.25 = 1e4 * (1e0.25) ≈ 1e4 * 1.778 ≈ 1.778e4. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 1e5 is 10^5, so (10^5)^0.8 = 10^(5*0.8)=10^4=10,000.

So, 1e5^0.8 =1e4.

Now, 6.67361^0.8: let's approximate.

6.67361 is about 6.67.

What's 6.67^0.8?

We can think of it as e^(0.8 ln(6.67)).

ln(6.67) ≈ 1.898.

0.8 * 1.898 ≈ 1.518.

e^1.518 ≈ approx 4.56.

So, 6.67^0.8 ≈4.56.

So, (6.67e5)^0.8 ≈4.56e4.

Wait, but wait, 4.56e4 is 45,600.

Wait, that seems a bit low. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps using a calculator would be better, but since I'm doing this manually, perhaps I can accept that Re^0.8 is about 45,600.

Wait, but let's check another approach. Let's take Re=667,361.

Compute Re^0.8:

Let me compute Re^0.8 as Re^(4/5) = (Re^1/5)^4.

What's Re^(1/5)? 667,361^(1/5) is the fifth root.

The fifth root of 1e6 is 10, since 10^5=1e5, but 1e6 is (10^6)^(1/5)=10^(6/5)=10^1.2≈15.8489.

Wait, 1e6 is 1,000,000, which is higher than 667,361. So let's compute 667,361^(1/5).

We can approximate:

10^5 = 100,000

15^5 = 759375, which is higher than 667,361.

So, 15^5=759,375

So, 667,361 is less than that. So, let's say the fifth root is around 14.7.

Because 14^5 = 14*14=196; 196*14=2744; 2744*14=38,416; 38,416*14=537,824.

Wait that can't be right. Wait, 14^5 = 14*14=196; 196*14=2744; 2744*14=38,416; 38,416*14=537,824. So 14^5=537,824.

15^5=759,375.

So 667,361 is between 14^5 and 15^5.

So, let's compute how much between.

667,361 - 537,824 = 129,537.

The difference between 15^5 and 14^5 is 759,375 - 537,824 = 221,551.

So, 667,361 is 129,537 / 221,551 ≈ 0.584 of the way from 14^5 to 15^5.

So, the fifth root is approximately 14 + 0.584*(15-14)=14.584.

So, Re^(1/5)=~14.584.

Then, Re^0.8 = (Re^(1/5))^4 ≈ (14.584)^4.

Compute 14.584^4:

14.584^2 = approx (14)^2=196, plus 2*14*0.584 + (0.584)^2 ≈ 196 + 16.352 + 0.341 ≈ 212.693.

Then, 212.693^2 ≈ let's compute that.

200^2=40,000.

12.693^2≈161.1.

And cross term 2*200*12.693=5077.2.

So total ≈40,000 + 5077.2 + 161.1≈45,238.3.

So Re^0.8 ≈45,238.

Hmm, that's around 45,238.

Now, Pr^(1/3) is Pr^0.333. Pr is about 0.707.

0.707^(1/3) is approximately 0.89.

Because 0.9^3=0.729, which is a bit higher than 0.707. So perhaps 0.89 is a good approximation.

Now, k is 0.0148 Btu/hr-ft-°F.

D is 0.04167 ft.

So, k/D = 0.0148 / 0.04167 ≈ 0.3548 Btu/(hr-ft²-°F).

Now, putting it all together:

h = 0.023 * Re^0.8 * Pr^0.333 * (k/D)

Plugging the numbers in:

h = 0.023 * 45,238 * 0.89 * 0.3548

Let me compute step by step.

First, 0.023 * 45,238 ≈ 0.023 * 45,000 = 1,035. Then 0.023 * 238≈5.474. So total ≈1,035 +5.474≈1,040.474.

Next, multiply by 0.89: 1,040.474 * 0.89 ≈ 926.025.

Then multiply by 0.3548: 926.025 * 0.3548 ≈ let's compute 926 * 0.35 is 324.1, and 926 * 0.0048≈4.445. So total ≈324.1 +4.445≈328.545.

So h ≈328.5 Btu/hr-ft²-°F.

Wait, but looking at the options, the highest is 20.4, which is way lower. Hmm, that can't be right. I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, that can't be right because the options are around 15-20, but my calculation gave me about 328.5, which is way off. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, let me go back and check the calculations.

First, perhaps I made a mistake in the Re calculation.

Re = (v * D * rho) / mu

v=80 ft/s

D=0.04167 ft

rho=0.0769 lbm/ft³

mu=3.84e-7 lb·s/ft²

So, v*D*rho = 80 * 0.04167 * 0.0769

Compute 80 * 0.04167 ≈3.3336

3.3336 * 0.0769 ≈0.2564 lbm/(ft·s)

mu=3.84e-7 lb·s/ft²

So Re = 0.2564 / 3.84e-7 ≈0.2564 / 0.000000384 ≈667,361.

That seems correct. So Re is about 667,361.

Wait, but maybe the formula uses D in inches? No, in the formula, D is in feet, since all units are in ft.

Wait, no, because the formula uses consistent units, so D is in ft, velocity in ft/s, rho in lbm/ft³, and mu in lb·s/ft². So the calculation is correct.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the Dittus-Boelter formula.

Wait, the formula is h = (0.023 * Re^0.8 * Pr^(1/3)) * (k / D)

Wait, but wait, perhaps the formula is h = (0.023 * Re^0.8 * Pr^0.333) * (k / D)

Yes, that's what I used.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in calculating Re^0.8.

Re^0.8 is 667,361^0.8.

Wait, earlier I approximated it as 45,238, but maybe that's incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use a logarithm approach.

Let me compute ln(667361) = ln(6.67361e5) = ln(6.67361) + ln(1e5) ≈1.898 + 11.5129 ≈13.4109.

Multiply by 0.8: 13.4109 * 0.8 =10.7287.

e^10.7287: e^10 is about 22026, e^0.7287≈2.072.

So e^10.7287≈22026 *2.072≈45,500.

So Re^0.8≈45,500.

Hmm, that's consistent with my earlier approximation.

Now, Pr=0.707, so Pr^0.333≈0.89.

k=0.0148 Btu/(hr·ft·°F)

D=0.04167 ft.

k/D=0.0148 /0.04167≈0.3548.

So, h=0.023 *45,500 *0.89 *0.3548.

Let me compute this again.

0.023 *45,500 = 1,046.5.

1,046.5 *0.89 ≈929.485.

929.485 *0.3548 ≈ let's compute.

Compute 929.485 *0.3 =278.8455

929.485 *0.05=46.47425

929.485 *0.0048≈4.469.

Adding them up: 278.8455 +46.47425=325.31975 +4.469≈329.788.

So h≈329.79 Btu/hr-ft²-°F.

But the options are way lower, like 15 to 20. So I must have made a mistake in the approach.

Wait a minute, perhaps I should have used the temperature at the wall or an average temperature for the fluid properties. Because the Dittus-Boelter equation uses the fluid's bulk temperature, which in this case is the entering temperature of 60°F. But maybe the problem expects me to use the wall temperature or the average.

Wait, but the wall is at 210°F, which is much higher than 60°F. Using the properties at 60°F seems correct because the fluid is at that temperature when entering.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the mean temperature between 60°F and 210°F, which is 135°F.

Hmm, that's a possibility. Maybe I should recalculate using 135°F for air properties.

So, let me get the properties of air at 135°F.

At 135°F (which is 51.67°C):

Density (rho) ≈ 0.0434 lbm/ft³

Viscosity (mu) ≈ 5.85 x 10^-7 lb·s/ft²

Thermal conductivity (k) ≈ 0.0178 Btu/hr-ft-°F

Specific heat (c_p) ≈ 0.245 Btu/lbm-°F

Prandtl number (Pr) ≈0.704.

Wait, let me confirm these values:

At 135°F:

rho ≈ 0.0434 lbm/ft³

mu ≈5.85e-7 lb·s/ft²

k ≈0.0178 Btu/hr·ft·°F

Pr ≈0.704.

Now, recalculate Re with these new properties.

Re = (v * D * rho) / mu

v=80 ft/s

D=0.04167 ft

rho=0.0434 lbm/ft³

mu=5.85e-7 lb·s/ft²

So,

v*D*rho =80 * 0.04167 *0.0434.

80 *0.04167≈3.3336

3.3336 *0.0434≈0.1446 lbm/(ft·s)

mu=5.85e-7 lb·s/ft²

So Re=0.1446 /5.85e-7 ≈0.1446 /0.000000585≈247,000.

So Re≈247,000.

Now, Re=247,000.

Compute Re^0.8:

Again, ln(247,000)= ln(2.47e5)= ln(2.47)+ln(1e5)=0.904 +11.513≈12.417.

Multiply by 0.8: 12.417*0.8=9.9336.

e^9.9336≈ e^10 is ~22026, e^-0.0664≈0.936.

So e^9.9336≈22026 *0.936≈20,580.

So Re^0.8≈20,580.

Pr=0.704, so Pr^0.333≈0.704^0.333≈0.89.

k=0.0178 Btu/hr·ft·°F.

D=0.04167 ft.

So, k/D=0.0178 /0.04167≈0.4264.

Now, compute h:

h=0.023 * Re^0.8 * Pr^0.333 * (k/D)

h=0.023 *20,580 *0.89 *0.4264.

Compute step by step.

0.023 *20,580 ≈473.34.

473.34 *0.89≈422.37.

422.37 *0.4264≈422.37 *0.4≈168.95, plus 422.37*0.0264≈11.16. So total≈168.95+11.16≈180.11.

So h≈180 Btu/hr·ft²·°F.

Still, this is higher than the options given, which are around 15-20. So perhaps this approach is incorrect.

Wait, maybe I'm using the wrong formula. Perhaps for internal flow, the Dittus-Boelter equation uses a different constant? I thought it's the same, but sometimes the constant varies slightly between sources.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the natural convention with different constants. Wait, another formula I remember is the Gnielinski equation, which is more accurate for certain flow conditions, but I'm not sure if that's applicable here.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the formula for convective heat transfer coefficient for air flow in a pipe using the formula:

h = (1.67 * v * c_p * Pr^0.333) * ( (Gr * Pr)^0.25 ) / D )

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps it's using the formula for forced convection in a pipe where the Nusselt number is given by the Dittus-Boelter equation, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula:

h = ( (0.023) * Re^0.8 * Pr^0.333 ) * (k / D)

But perhaps the 0.023 factor is not correct for air? Wait, no, I think 0.023 is correct for air in the turbulent flow regime.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm using the wrong thermal conductivity value. Let me double-check the thermal conductivity of air at 60°F and 135°F.

At 60°F, k is about 0.0148 Btu/hr·ft·°F.

At 135°F, I think it's higher, around 0.0178, as I used earlier.

Wait, perhaps I should check the exact value of the thermal conductivity of air at 60°F and 135°F.

From tables:

At 20°C (68°F), k is about 0.0148 W/m·K, which converts to 0.0148 * (3.1778) = ~0.0469 Btu/hr·ft·°F. Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, the conversion from W/m·K to Btu/hr·ft·°F is as follows:

1 W/m·K = 0.5778 Btu/hr·ft·°F.

So, 0.0148 W/m·K *0.5778≈0.00854 Btu/hr·ft·°F.

Wait, that can't be right because earlier I thought 0.0148 was in Btu/hr·ft·°F. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in units earlier.

Wait, no, perhaps I confused units. Let me clarify.

The thermal conductivity of air at 20°C (68°F) is approximately 0.026 W/m·K, which converts to 0.026 *0.5778≈0.015 Btu/hr·ft·°F. So at 60°F, k≈0.015 Btu/hr·ft·°F.

Similarly, at higher temperatures, say 135°F (51.7°C), k increases to around 0.026 W/m·K, which is 0.015 Btu/hr·ft·°F as well. Wait, that can't be right because thermal conductivity increases with temperature.

Wait, perhaps I should look up the exact values.

Upon checking, at 60°F, air's thermal conductivity is approximately 0.0148 W/m·K, which is about 0.0085 Btu/hr·ft·°F (using 1 W/m·K = 0.5778 Btu/hr·ft·°F).

Wait, that's lower than I thought earlier. So perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier calculation by using k as 0.0148 Btu/hr·ft·°F when actually it's about 0.0085.

Wait, that's a significant difference. Let me correct that.

So, if k is 0.0085 Btu/hr·ft·°F at 60°F, then let's recalculate.

First, using 60°F properties:

rho=0.0769 lbm/ft³

mu=3.84e-7 lb·s/ft²

k=0.0085 Btu/hr·ft·°F

c_p=0.24 Btu/lbm·°F

Pr=0.707.

Re=667,361 as before.

h=0.023 * (667,361)^0.8 * (0.707)^0.333 * (0.0085 / 0.04167)

Compute each part:

Re^0.8≈45,500.

Pr^0.333≈0.89.

k/D=0.0085 /0.04167≈0.204.

So,

h=0.023 *45,500 *0.89 *0.204.

Compute step by step:

0.023 *45,500 = 1,046.5.

1,046.5 *0.89≈929.485.

929.485 *0.204≈190.05.

So h≈190 Btu/hr·ft²·°F.

Still, this is higher than the options given. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should use the mean temperature for the fluid properties. Let's try that.

Mean temperature T_mean=(210 +60)/2=135°F.

At 135°F, k is higher.

At 135°F, k≈0.0178 W/m·K = 0.0178 *0.5778≈0.0102 Btu/hr·ft·°F.

So, k=0.0102 Btu/hr·ft·°F.

Re=247,000 as calculated earlier.

h=0.023 * (247,000)^0.8 * (0.704)^0.333 * (0.0102 /0.04167)

Compute each part:

Re^0.8≈20,580.

Pr^0.333≈0.89.

k/D=0.0102 /0.04167≈0.2447.

So,

h=0.023 *20,580 *0.89 *0.2447.

Compute:

0.023 *20,580≈473.34.

473.34 *0.89≈422.37.

422.37 *0.2447≈103.16.

So h≈103.16 Btu/hr·ft²·°F.

Still too high compared to the options.

Hmm, perhaps I'm using the wrong formula. Another approach could be to use the formula for convective heat transfer coefficient for air in a pipe based on velocity and properties.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the simplified formula:

h = (1.12 * v^0.5 * c_p * Pr^0.333) * ( ( (T_wall - T_air) ) )

Wait, but that doesn't seem correct. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula:

h = (0.012 * v^0.5 * c_p * Pr^0.333) * ( (T_wall - T_air) )

Wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to calculate the heat flux using the formula:

q = h * A * (T_wall - T_air)

But I don't have q, so that's not helpful.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the problem is so small that the heat transfer is negligible, but that doesn't make sense because the options are specific numbers.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k. Let me double-check the thermal conductivity of air at different temperatures.

Upon checking, the thermal conductivity of air at 20°C (68°F) is about 0.026 W/m·K, which is 0.026 * 0.5778 ≈ 0.015 Btu/hr·ft·°F.

At higher temperatures, say 100°C (212°F), k increases to about 0.035 W/m·K, which is ~0.0203 Btu/hr·ft·°F.

Wait, but 135°F is about 51.7°C, so perhaps k is around 0.020 W/m·K, which would be 0.020 *0.5778≈0.01155 Btu/hr·ft·°F.

So, let's try with k=0.01155 at 135°F.

So, h=0.023 *20,580 *0.89 * (0.01155 /0.04167)

Compute 0.01155/0.04167≈0.277.

So,

0.023 *20,580≈473.34.

473.34 *0.89≈422.37.

422.37 *0.277≈116.6.

Hmm, still not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the Dittus-Boelter equation is only applicable for fully developed turbulent flow, and maybe the pipe is not long enough for the flow to develop. But the pipe is 5 feet long, which might be sufficient, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for convective heat transfer coefficient in terms of the velocity and the thermal properties without considering the Reynolds number.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem expects me to use the formula:

h = (v * c_p * Pr)^(1/3) * (0.012 * (T_wall - T_air)^0.25 )

Wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's using the formula for natural convection, but the problem states that the air is flowing at a uniform speed, so it's forced convection.

Wait, perhaps I should look for an alternative formula. I recall that for air in a pipe, sometimes the formula is expressed as:

h = 1.03 * (v * D * rho * mu)^0.5 * (c_p * Pr)^0.5

Wait, but that doesn't sound familiar. Alternatively, perhaps it's using the formula:

h = (v * k) / (D * c_p * Pr)

Wait, that might not be correct, but let's try.

At 60°F:

v=80 ft/s

k=0.0148 Btu/hr·ft·°F

D=0.04167 ft

c_p=0.24 Btu/lbm·°F

Pr=0.707.

So,

h=(80 *0.0148)/(0.04167 *0.24 *0.707 )

Compute numerator:80 *0.0148=1.184.

Denominator:0.04167 *0.24=0.010, 0.010 *0.707≈0.00707.

So h=1.184 /0.00707≈167.5 Btu/hr·ft²·°F.

Still too high.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula:

h = (0.5 * v * c_p * Pr)^(1/3) * ( (T_wall - T_air) )^(1/4)

But I'm not sure about this formula either.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the heat transfer per unit length and calculate accordingly.

Wait, the pipe is 5 feet long, but I don't think the length affects the h calculation, as h is per unit area.

Wait, maybe I should think differently. Perhaps the problem is expecting me to use the formula for heat transfer in a pipe with forced convection, where h is calculated based on the velocity and properties, but perhaps using a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach by not considering that the pipe is small, so the velocity is high, but the heat transfer coefficient is lower.

Wait, let's think about the options given. The options are around 15-20 Btu/hr·ft²·°F. But according to my calculations, I'm getting around 180-329, which is way higher. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula for external flow instead of internal flow. No, the problem is about internal flow through a pipe.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula should be h = (0.023 * Re^0.8 * Pr^0.333) * (k / D), but perhaps I made a mistake in the units or the exponent.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the formula uses the diameter in inches instead of feet. Let me check that.

If I use D=0.5 inches, which is 0.5/12=0.04167 ft, which is correct. But perhaps I should convert D to inches in the formula. Wait, no, because the formula uses consistent units, so if D is in feet, then it's correct.

Wait, perhaps the 0.023 factor is in a different unit system. Wait, 0.023 comes from empirical data, so perhaps it's unit-dependent. Wait, in the English system, the 0.023 factor is correct for h in Btu/hr·ft²·°F.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula with the diameter in meters or another unit, but that would complicate things.

Hmm, perhaps I should look for a different approach. Maybe I can use the formula for convective heat transfer coefficient for air in a pipe based on the velocity and properties, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem expects me to use the formula:

h = (0.013 * v^0.5 * c_p * Pr^0.333) * (T_wall - T_air)^(1/4)

But I'm not sure if that's accurate.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to use the formula:

h = (0.012 * v^0.5 * c_p * Pr^0.333) * ( (T_wall - T_air) )^(0.25 )

Let me try that.

At 60°F:

v=80 ft/s

c_p=0.24 Btu/lbm·°F

Pr=0.707

T_wall - T_air=210 -60=150°F.

So,

h=0.012 * (80)^0.5 * (0.24) * (0.707)^0.333 * (150)^(0.25)

Compute each part:

80^0.5≈8.944.

(0.707)^0.333≈0.89.

150^0.25≈3.076.

So,

h=0.012 *8.944 *0.24 *0.89 *3.076.

Compute step by step:

0.012 *8.944≈0.1073.

0.1073 *0.24≈0.02575.

0.02575 *0.89≈0.02297.

0.02297 *3.076≈0.0704.

So h≈0.0704 Btu/hr·ft²·°F.

That's way too low, so this formula must be incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

h = (0.012 * v^0.5 * c_p * Pr^0.333) * ( (T_wall - T_air) )^(0.25 )

But I think I did that already and got 0.07.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula for external flow, where the coefficient is lower, but the problem states it's internal flow.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the air is at standard atmospheric pressure, so maybe the properties are slightly different, but I think I've already accounted for that.

Wait, perhaps I should check the units again. Let me make sure all units are consistent.

In the Dittus-Boelter formula, the units should be in the English system: v in ft/s, D in ft, rho in lbm/ft³, mu in lb·s/ft², k in Btu/hr·ft·°F.

Yes, I think I did that correctly.

Wait, but perhaps the formula uses the diameter in inches instead of feet. Let me try that.

If D=0.5 inches, then in feet it's 0.5/12=0.04167 ft, which is what I used.

Wait, perhaps I should use D in inches in the formula. Let me try that.

If D=0.5 inches, then in the formula, perhaps I should convert it to feet, which I did. So that's correct.

Hmm, I'm stuck. My calculations give h values around 100-300, but the options are 15-20. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula for natural convection instead of forced. But the problem states that the air is flowing at a uniform speed, so it's forced convection.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the formula:

h = (v * k) / (D)

But that would be:

v=80 ft/s

k=0.0148 Btu/hr·ft·°F

D=0.04167 ft.

So,

h= (80 *0.0148) / 0.04167 ≈ (1.184)/0.04167≈28.43 Btu/hr·ft²·°F.

Still not matching the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is h = v * k / D.

So, 80 *0.0148 /0.04167≈28.43, as above.

But the options are lower.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula for heat transfer per unit length.

Wait, the pipe is 5 feet long, but h is per unit area, so length shouldn't affect h.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to calculate the heat flux and then find h.

But without knowing the heat transfer rate, I can't find h that way.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula for heat transfer coefficient in terms of the Nusselt number, which is Nu = h * D / k.

And for a pipe, Nu = 4.36 for laminar flow, but our Re is 667k, which is turbulent, so Nu is higher.

Wait, but for turbulent flow in a pipe, the Dittus-Boelter equation gives Nu = 0.023 * Re^0.8 * Pr^0.333.

So, Nu = h * D / k.

So, h = (Nu * k) / D.

So, let's compute Nu first.

At 60°F, Re=667,361.

Pr=0.707.

Nu=0.023 * (667361)^0.8 * (0.707)^0.333.

Compute:

(667361)^0.8≈45,500.

(0.707)^0.333≈0.89.

So, Nu=0.023 *45,500 *0.89≈0.023 *40,495≈931.385.

Then, h= (931.385 * k) / D.

k=0.0148 Btu/hr·ft·°F.

D=0.04167 ft.

So,

h= (931.385 *0.0148 ) /0.04167 ≈ (13.826) /0.04167≈331.3 Btu/hr·ft²·°F.

Again, same result as before, which is way higher than the options.

Hmm, I'm not sure where I'm going wrong. Perhaps the problem expects me to use a different method, such as the analogy between heat and momentum transfer, but I'm not familiar enough with that.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula for heat transfer coefficient based on the velocity and the temperature difference, but I can't recall such a formula.

Wait, perhaps I should look for an example problem similar to this. Suppose I have a pipe of certain dimensions, velocity, and temperatures, and I need to find h.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering only the temperature difference and not the flow properties, which doesn't make sense because h depends on flow conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to use the mean flow properties, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula:

h = (v * c_p * Pr)^(1/3) * ( (T_wall - T_air) )^(1/4 )

Let me try that.

At 60°F:

v=80 ft/s

c_p=0.24 Btu/lbm·°F

Pr=0.707

T_wall - T_air=150°F.

So,

h= (80 *0.24 *0.707)^(1/3) * (150)^(1/4 )

Compute inside the cube root:

80 *0.24=19.2

19.2 *0.707≈13.58.

So, cube root of 13.58≈2.38.

150^(1/4)= approx 3.076.

So,

h=2.38 *3.076≈7.31 Btu/hr·ft²·°F.

Still too low.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

h = (v * c_p * Pr)^(1/3) * ( (T_wall - T_air) )^(1/4 )

But with different exponents.

Alternatively, perhaps it's:

h = (0.012 * v^0.5 * c_p * Pr^0.333) * ( (T_wall - T_air) )^(0.25 )

Which would give:

0.012 * sqrt(80) *0.24 * (0.707)^0.333 * (150)^0.25.

Compute:

sqrt(80)=8.944

(0.707)^0.333≈0.89

150^0.25≈3.076

So,

h=0.012 *8.944 *0.24 *0.89 *3.076 ≈ same as before, 0.07.

No, that's too low.

I'm stuck. My calculations keep giving me h around 100-300, but the options are 15-20. I must have made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula for heat transfer coefficient in terms of the velocity and the properties, but I'm not considering the correct formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

h = (1.68 * v^0.5 * c_p * Pr^0.333) * ( (T_wall - T_air) )^(0.25 )

Let me try that.

At 60°F:

v=80

c_p=0.24

Pr=0.707

T_diff=150.

So,

h=1.68 * sqrt(80) *0.24 * (0.707)^0.333 * (150)^0.25.

Compute:

sqrt(80)=8.944

(0.707)^0.333≈0.89

150^0.25≈3.076

So,

h=1.68 *8.944 *0.24 *0.89 *3.076.

Compute step by step:

1.68 *8.944≈15.06.

15.06 *0.24≈3.614.

3.614 *0.89≈3.216.

3.216 *3.076≈9.88.

So h≈9.88 Btu/hr·ft²·°F.

Still too low.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the formula:

h = (0.013 * v^0.5 * c_p * Pr^0.333) * (T_wall - T_air)^(0.25 )

Which would give:

0.013 *8.944 *0.24 *0.89 *3.076≈ same as before, around 0.07.

No, that's not it.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the problem is using the formula for heat transfer coefficient based on the thermal resistance of the pipe.

The thermal resistance R is L/(h*A), where L is length, A is area.

But without knowing the heat transfer rate, I can't find h that way.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to use the formula:

h = (v * c_p * (T_wall - T_air)) / (D * x)

Where x is the length. But that seems incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the problem differently. Maybe it's a simple formula where h is proportional to velocity and some properties.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to use the formula:

h = (v * k) / D

Let me try that.

v=80 ft/s

k=0.0148 Btu/hr·ft·°F

D=0.04167 ft.

So,

h= (80 *0.0148) /0.04167 ≈ (1.184)/0.04167≈28.43 Btu/hr·ft²·°F.

Still higher than options.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula:

h = (v * c_p * Pr) / D

At 60°F:

v=80

c_p=0.24

Pr=0.707

D=0.04167.

So,

h= (80 *0.24 *0.707 ) /0.04167 ≈ (13.58) /0.04167≈325.9.

Again, same issue.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider that the problem is using the formula for external flow, but I don't think that's the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to use the formula for natural convection, but it's not applicable here since the flow is forced.

Wait, perhaps I should look for another approach. Maybe the problem is using the formula:

h = (0.012 * v^0.5 * c_p * Pr^0.333) * ( (T_wall - T_air) )^(0.25 )

Which I tried earlier and got around 0.07, which is too low.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is different, and I should consider that the problem is using the formula:

h = (0.023 * Re^0.8 * Pr^0.333) * (k / D)

But perhaps I made a mistake in calculating Re.

Wait, let me recalculate Re using the correct properties.

At 60°F:

rho=0.0769 lbm/ft³

mu=3.84e-7 lb·s/ft²

v=80 ft/s

D=0.04167 ft.

Re= (v * D * rho) / mu = (80 *0.04167 *0.0769) /3.84e-7.

Compute numerator:80 *0.04167=3.3336; 3.3336 *0.0769≈0.2564.

Denominator:3.84e-7.

So Re=0.2564 /3.84e-7 ≈667,361.

So Re is correct.

Thus, using the correct formula, h≈328 Btu/hr·ft²·°F, which doesn't match any options.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to use the formula for the coefficient of heat transfer as simply h = k/D, but that would be 0.0148 /0.04167≈0.3548 Btu/hr·ft²·°F, which is not among the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to use the formula:

h = (v * c_p * (T_wall - T_air)) / (D * x)

Where x is the length, but that seems incorrect.

Wait, maybe it's a matter of units. Did I mix up units somewhere?

Wait, the thermal conductivity k is given in Btu/hr·ft·°F, which is correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is expecting me to use the formula for heat transfer coefficient in terms of the velocity and the temperature difference, but I'm not aware of such a formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula:

h = (v * c_p * (T_wall - T_air)) / (D * x)

But plugging in the numbers:

v=80

c_p=0.24

T_diff=150

D=0.04167

x=5.

h= (80 *0.24 *150) / (0.04167 *5 )= (80 *0.24=19.2; 19.2*150=2880) / (0.20835)≈13,820.

Which is way too high.

I'm really stuck here. All my calculations are leading me to h≈328 Btu/hr·ft²·°F, but the options are much lower. I must have made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula for heat transfer coefficient based on the thermal resistivity. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the formula:

h = (v * k) / D

Which would be:

h= (80 *0.0148) /0.04167≈28.43 Btu/hr·ft²·°F.

But that's still higher than the options.

Wait, maybe the problem is using the formula for heat transfer coefficient as h = v * c_p * Pr, but that would be:

h=80 *0.24 *0.707≈13.58 Btu/hr·ft²·°F.

Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula:

h = (v * c_p * (T_wall - T_air)) / (D)

Which would be:

h= (80 *0.24 *150 ) /0.04167≈ (28,800) /0.04167≈692,160 Btu/hr·ft²·°F.

Which is way too high.

I'm really not sure where I'm going wrong. Perhaps I should look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is expecting me to use the formula for heat transfer coefficient in terms of the velocity and the specific heat, but I can't recall such a formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to use the formula:

h = (0.012 * v^0.5 * c_p * Pr^0.333) * ( (T_wall - T_air) )^(1/4 )

Which I tried earlier and got around 0.07.

But that's way too low.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula for heat transfer coefficient in terms of the Nusselt number, but perhaps the Nusselt number is being calculated differently.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula:

Nu = (h * D) / k

So, h = (Nu * k) / D.

But to find Nu, perhaps it's using a different correlation.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula:

Nu = 0.023 * Re^0.8 * Pr^0.333

Which is what I did earlier.

But as per that, Nu=0.023 *667,361^0.8 *0.707^0.333≈931.

Then h=(931 *0.0148)/0.04167≈331 Btu/hr·ft²·°F.

Which is again too high.

I'm really stuck. I think I must have made a mistake in the approach, but I can't figure out where. Perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to use the formula:

h = (v * k) / (D * x)

Where x is the length.

So,

h= (80 *0.0148 ) / (0.04167 *5 )≈(1.184)/0.20835≈5.67 Btu/hr·ft²·°F.

Still too low.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula:

h = (v * k) / (D * (T_wall - T_air))

Which would be:

h= (80 *0.0148 ) / (0.04167 *150 )≈1.184 /6.25≈0.189.

Way too low.

I'm really not sure. Given that none of my approaches are matching the options, perhaps I should try to see which option makes sense based on the data.

Looking at the options:

A:20.4

B:17.1

C:15.2

D:18.6

These are all around 15-20.

If I assume that the correct answer is around 18, perhaps option D.

But I'm not confident because my calculations suggest a much higher value.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of Re. Let me recheck.

Re= (v * D * rho) / mu.

v=80

D=0.04167

rho=0.0769

mu=3.84e-7.

So,

v*D*rho =80 *0.04167 *0.0769.

80 *0.04167=3.3336.

3.3336 *0.0769≈0.2564 lbm/(ft·s).

mu=3.84e-7.

So Re=0.2564 /3.84e-7 ≈667,361.

That's correct.

Wait, maybe I should use the formula for h in terms of the Grashof number, but that's for natural convection, which isn't the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to use the formula:

h = (0.012 * v^0.5 * c_p * Pr^0.333) * ( (T_wall - T_air) )^(0.25 )

Which would give:

h≈0.012 *8.944 *0.24 *0.89 *3.076≈0.07.

No, that's too low.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula:

h = (0.013 * v^0.5 * c_p * Pr^0.333) * ( (T_wall - T_air) )^(0.25 )

Which would give:

h≈0.013 *8.944 *0.24 *0.89 *3.076≈0.08.

Still too low.

I'm really stuck. I think I must have made a mistake in the approach, but I can't figure it out. Given the options, I'll have to make an educated guess. Perhaps the correct answer is around 18.6, which is option D.

The problem involves calculating the convective heat transfer coefficient \( h \) for air flowing through a pipe under specified conditions. The key steps involve determining the Reynolds number (\( Re \)) and using the Dittus-Boelter equation for turbulent flow. The properties of air at the bulk temperature (60°F) were used, including density (\( \rho \)), viscosity (\( \mu \)), thermal conductivity (\( k \)), specific heat (\( c_p \)), and Prandtl number (\( Pr \)). The Reynolds number was calculated as \( Re \approx 667,361 \), confirming turbulent flow. Using the Dittus-Boelter equation:

\[
h = 0.023 \cdot Re^{0.8} \cdot Pr^{1/3} \cdot \frac{k}{D}
\]

The calculations yielded \( h \approx 328 \, \text{Btu/hr-ft}^2-°F \), which is significantly higher than the provided options. Despite multiple recalculations and verifying the properties, the result remained inconsistent with the options. Given the discrepancy, an educated guess was made based on the closest plausible value among the options.
