Okay, so I have this question about atoms emitting alpha or beta particles and what happens to them. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my nuclear chemistry, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that when an atom emits an alpha particle, it loses two protons and two neutrons. An alpha particle is a helium nucleus, right? So if an atom emits that, its atomic number (which is the number of protons) decreases by 2. Since the element is determined by the atomic number, the element changes. For example, uranium-238 decays into thorium when it emits an alpha particle. So the element definitely changes in that case.

Then there's beta particles. A beta particle is an electron emitted when a neutron turns into a proton. So in beta minus decay, the atom gains a proton. This also changes the atomic number by +1, meaning the element changes again. For example, carbon-14 decays into nitrogen-14. So in both alpha and beta emissions, the element changes.

Looking at the options now. Option B says it becomes a different element always. Option E says sometimes. But since both alpha and beta always change the element, it's not sometimes. So B might be correct, but wait, let me check the other options.

Option H says it may become a different element. But since in both cases it does become different, it's not just a possibility. So B and E and H are possibilities.

Wait, but the question says "any atom that emits an alpha or beta particle." So any such emission would change the element. So every time it emits, it's a different element. So the answer would be B: becomes an atom of a different element always.

Wait, but let me think again. Are there any cases where emitting an alpha or beta doesn't change the element? I don't think so. Alpha always reduces Z by 2, beta increases Z by 1. Both change the element. So the correct answer should be B. But wait, looking at the options again.

Option E: becomes a different element sometimes. That would be incorrect because it's always. So B is correct.

When an atom emits an alpha particle, it loses two protons and two neutrons, reducing its atomic number by 2, which changes the element. Similarly, emitting a beta particle involves a neutron converting into a proton, increasing the atomic number by 1, also changing the element. In both cases, the element always changes. Therefore, the correct answer is:

B

Answer: B
