Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about Huemer's argument regarding the harms of drug use. The question is asking what Huemer argues about the harms of drug use in comparison to legally permitted harmful activities. The options are A, B, C, D, and so on up to J, but the options given here are A to D, with D being "All of the above."

First, I need to recall what Huemer's stance is on drug use. From what I remember, Huemer is a philosopher who has written about drug policy. He often argues against the prohibition of drugs like cannabis. I think he makes the point that the harms of drug use aren't fundamentally different from the harms caused by other legal activities.

Looking at the options:

Option A says that the harms of drug use are no more harmful on average than legally permitted harmful activities. So, Huemer would probably agree that the average harm isn't significantly worse than other legal activities.

Option B states that the harms of drug use don't differ from other legally permitted harmful activities. This seems similar to A but is phrased differently. It's about whether the type of harm is different, not just the degree.

Option C claims that the harms are no more detrimental to a person's character. So, it's about the moral or character impact, not just physical or societal harm.

Option D is "All of the above," meaning all A, B, and C are correct according to Huemer.

I think Huemer's argument is that the harms of drugs aren't uniquely worse than what's already legal. So, he would agree that on average, the harms aren't more severe (A), that the nature of the harms isn't different (B), and that the impact on character isn't worse (C). Therefore, the correct answer would be D, as all the options are points Huemer supports.

Wait, but I should make sure. Maybe he doesn't argue about character detriment? Or perhaps he focuses more on the physical and societal harms. I'm a bit fuzzy on that. But given that the options are about whether the harms are in an important sense more harmful, I think he would cover all aspects, including the impact on character. So, D seems right.

The correct answer is D.
