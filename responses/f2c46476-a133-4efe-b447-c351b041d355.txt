Question:

Police officers had probable cause to believe that drug dealing was routinely taking place in a particular room at a local motel. The motel manager authorized the officers to enter the room and provided them with a passkey. Without obtaining a warrant, the officers knocked on the room's door, announced their presence, and told the occupants that they would like to speak with them. The officers then heard yelling and repeated flushing of the toilet. They then used the passkey and entered the room, where they saw the occupants dumping drugs into the toilet. The occupants of the room were charged with drug dealing and have moved to suppress the drugs. Should the court grant the motion to suppress?

Options:

A: No, because the sound of flushing toilet provided sufficient reason for immediate entry.
B: Yes, because the motel manager did not have the authority to consent to the officers' entry.
C: Yes, because the officers did not have a search warrant.
D: Yes, because the officers cannot benefit from exigent circumstances that they created.
E: No, because exigent circumstances justified the officers' entry.
F: Yes, because the officers should have waited for the occupants to open the door.
G: No, because the occupants were actively destroying evidence.
H: Yes, because exigent circumstances cannot excuse the lack of a warrant.
I: No, because the motel manager consented to the officers' entry.
J: No, because the officers had probable cause to enter the room.

Alright, let's try to work through this problem step by step. So, the question is about whether the court should grant the motion to suppress the drugs that were found in the motel room. Let me break down the facts first.

The police officers had probable cause to believe that drug dealing was happening in a particular motel room. They approached the motel manager, who authorized them to enter and gave them a passkey. Without getting a warrant, the officers knocked on the door, announced themselves, and told the occupants they wanted to speak. Then, they heard yelling and repeated flushing of the toilet. Using the passkey, they entered the room and saw the occupants dumping drugs into the toilet. Now, the occupants are being charged, and they're moving to suppress the evidence.

So, the issue here is whether the evidence (the drugs) should be suppressed because the officers' entry might have violated the Fourth Amendment, which protects against unreasonable searches and seizures. 

First, I need to consider the legal principles involved. The Fourth Amendment generally requires a search warrant, but there are exceptions. One of those exceptions is consent, another is probable cause combined with exigent circumstances. 

In this case, the motel manager gave consent, right? So, the officers used the passkey provided by the manager. But wait, the manager's authority to consent would depend on whether they had the right to do so. If the manager owned the motel and the room, then he could consent. But if the room was rented by someone else, the manager might not have the authority to consent to a search of the room. Hmm, but in motels, typically, the manager can consent to searches of the rooms because they have control over access. So, maybe the consent was valid.

But then, even if the consent was valid, there's another issue: the officers heard yelling and flushing. That might imply that evidence was being destroyed. So, could that be an exigent circumstance? Exigent circumstances allow officers to enter without a warrant if there's an immediate need to prevent the destruction of evidence, danger to someone's safety, etc.

Wait, but the officers knocked, announced, and then heard the sounds. They had the passkey, so they could have just waited for the occupants to open the door. But they chose to enter because they heard the toilet flushing and yelling. So, does that mean they had exigent circumstances because they thought evidence was being destroyed?

But here's a point: if the police create the exigent circumstances themselves, that can't be used to justify the warrantless entry. For example, in the case of Texas v. Johnson, the Supreme Court held that police cannot制造the situation that would allow them to bypass the warrant requirement. So, if the officers' actions caused the occupants to flush the drugs, then they can't claim exigent circumstances because they created the problem themselves.

In this scenario, the officers knocked, announced, and then heard the flushing. Did their presence cause the occupants to start destroying evidence? It's possible. So, if they caused the exigent circumstances, then they can't use that as a justification. That would mean their entry without a warrant was unlawful, and the evidence should be suppressed.

Looking at the options:

Option D says, "Yes, because the officers cannot benefit from exigent circumstances that they created." That seems to align with what I'm thinking.

Option E says, "No, because exigent circumstances justified the entry." But if they created the circumstances, E would be incorrect.

Option B and I relate to consent. B says the manager didn't have authority, but I think he did. So B is probably wrong.

Option C says yes because no warrant, but consent is an exception, so if the consent was valid, then the warrant wasn't needed.

Option G says no because occupants were destroying evidence. But if the police created the situation, G's reasoning might not apply.

So, putting it together, the correct answer seems to be D. The officers can't use exigent circumstances if they were the ones who caused it. Therefore, the evidence should be suppressed.

The officers' entry into the room without a warrant was unlawful because they created the exigent circumstances by announcing their presence, which likely led the occupants to destroy evidence. Exigent circumstances cannot justify a warrantless search if the police are the ones who caused the situation. Therefore, the court should grant the motion to suppress the drugs.

Answer: D
