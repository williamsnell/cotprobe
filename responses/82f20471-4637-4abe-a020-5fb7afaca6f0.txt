Answer:
    
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the mass of the light isotope of helium from this reaction. The reaction given is _3Li^6 + _1H^1 → _2He^4 + _2He^3. The Q-value is 3.945 MeV. Hmm, I remember that in nuclear reactions, the Q-value relates to the mass difference between the reactants and products. 

The masses provided are for _1H^1 (1.00813 amu), _2He^4 (4.00386 amu), and _3Li^6 (6.01692 amu). Wait, the product side has _2He^3, and I need to find its mass. Oh, right, because the question is asking for the mass of the light isotope of helium, which I think is _2He^3 since the other isotope is _2He^4.

So, the reaction is a fusion or perhaps a fission, but more likely a fusion since it's combining a proton and a lithium nucleus. But wait, the products are helium-4 and helium-3. Hmm, that's a bit unusual. Maybe it's a step in a broader reaction, but let's focus on the given data.

The general equation for the mass-energy equivalence is that the Q-value equals the difference in mass times c squared. But since we're dealing in amu and MeV, I think the formula is Q = (sum of reactant masses - sum of product masses) * c², but usually, we can relate them using the conversion factor between amu and MeV.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. I think the formula is:

Q = (mass reactants - mass products) * c²

But since c² is a constant, and when using amu and MeV, I recall that 1 amu is approximately 931.5 MeV/c². So, the equation can be rearranged to find the mass difference.

So, the reaction is:

Li-6 (mass 6.01692) + H-1 (mass 1.00813) → He-4 (mass 4.00386) + He-3 (mass m, which we need to find).

The sum of the reactant masses is 6.01692 + 1.00813 = 7.02505 amu.

The sum of the product masses is 4.00386 + m.

The Q-value is given as 3.945 MeV. Since this is exothermic, the mass of the reactants should be greater than the mass of the products. So, Q is positive when reactants are heavier.

So, the mass difference (reactants - products) should equal Q / (931.5 MeV/amu).

Wait, let me write the equation properly.

Q = (sum reactant masses - sum product masses) * 931.5 MeV/amu.

So, 3.945 MeV = (7.02505 - (4.00386 + m)) * 931.5.

Let me compute the right side. Let's first compute the mass difference:

3.945 = (7.02505 - 4.00386 - m) * 931.5

Wait, 7.02505 - 4.00386 is 3.02119.

So, 3.945 = (3.02119 - m) * 931.5

Divide both sides by 931.5 to get (3.02119 - m) = 3.945 / 931.5.

Calculating 3.945 / 931.5 ≈ 0.004235.

So, 3.02119 - m ≈ 0.004235.

Rearranging, m = 3.02119 - 0.004235 = approximately 3.016955 amu.

Wait, but the product is He-3, which I think has a known mass. Let me check the options. Looking at the options, option D is 3.01603 amu. Hmm, but my calculation gives about 3.016955, which is close to option D but a bit higher. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, let me check the calculation again.

Q = 3.945 MeV.

The equation is:

3.945 = (6.01692 + 1.00813 - 4.00386 - m) * 931.5

So, 6.01692 + 1.00813 = 7.02505

7.02505 - 4.00386 = 3.02119

So, 3.945 = (3.02119 - m) * 931.5

So, 3.02119 - m = 3.945 / 931.5 ≈ 0.004235.

So, m = 3.02119 - 0.004235 ≈ 3.016955 amu.

Looking at the options, option D is 3.01603 amu, which is close but a bit lower. Hmm. Did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Wait, perhaps I should be more precise with the division.

3.945 divided by 931.5.

Let me compute 3.945 / 931.5.

Well, 931.5 * 0.004 = 3.726.

0.00423 * 931.5 = let's compute 0.004 * 931.5 = 3.726; 0.00023 *931.5 ≈ 0.214. So, 3.726 +0.214 = 3.94, which is close to 3.945. So, 0.00423 *931.5 ≈ 3.94245. That's very close to 3.945.

Wait, but 0.00423 *931.5 = 3.94245 MeV. But we have 3.945 MeV, which is 0.00255 MeV higher. So, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

3.945 / 931.5 = let's compute 931.5 * x =3.945.

x = 3.945 /931.5 = approx 0.004235.

Wait, but perhaps I should compute it as:

3.945 /931.5 = (3.945 /931.5) ≈ 0.004235 (exactly, 3.945 ÷ 931.5 ≈ 0.004235).

So, 3.02119 - m = 0.004235 → m = 3.02119 - 0.004235 = 3.016955.

Looking at the options, the closest is option D: 3.01603 amu. But wait, there's another option: option I is 0.01696 amu, which seems too low. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the formula. The Q-value is the energy released, which is the mass difference times c². So, the correct formula is Q = (sum reactants - sum products) * 931.5.

So, 3.945 = (7.02505 - (4.00386 + m)) *931.5.

So, yes, that's correct. So m = 3.02119 - (3.945 /931.5) ≈ 3.016955.

Looking at the options, option D is 3.01603 amu, which is pretty close but a bit lower. Hmm. Did I perhaps miscalculate the division?

Let me compute 3.945 /931.5 exactly.

3.945 ÷ 931.5.

Let me compute 931.5 * 0.004235 = ?

0.004 * 931.5 = 3.726.

0.000235 *931.5 = let's compute 0.0002 *931.5=0.1863, 0.000035*931.5≈0.0326. So total ≈0.2189.

So 3.726 + 0.2189 ≈3.9449, which is approximately 3.945. So x=0.004235.

So, 3.02119 -0.004235=3.016955.

But the options don't have this. The closest is D:3.01603.

Alternatively, perhaps I should check the given masses again. Wait, maybe the mass of He-4 is 4.00386. So sum of products is 4.00386 + m.

So, 7.02505 - (4.00386 + m) = 3.02119 - m.

But then 3.02119 -m = 3.945 /931.5=0.004235.

So m=3.02119 -0.004235=3.016955. So that's about 3.01696 amu. Wait, looking at the options, option I is 0.01696 amu, which is way too small. Option D is 3.01603, which is 3.01603. Hmm, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the subtraction.

Wait, 3.02119 minus 0.004235 is:

3.02119 -0.004235 = 3.016955 amu.

Looking at the options, option D is 3.01603 amu, which is 0.000925 amu less. That seems like a small difference, but perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup.

Wait a second, perhaps I should consider that the Q-value is given as 3.945 MeV, but I might have to ensure the units are correct. Oh wait, the formula is correct because 1 amu is about 931.5 MeV/c², so the calculation should be correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the masses are given with more decimal points, but the problem only gives four decimal places. So maybe the correct value is approximately 3.01696, but looking at the options, I don't see that. Wait, option I is 0.01696 amu, which is way too small. So perhaps I made a mistake in the reaction equation.

Wait, let me look at the reaction again. It's _3Li^6 + _1H^1 → _2He^4 + _2He^3. So, the products are He-4 and He-3. So the sum of the products is 4.00386 + m, where m is He-3's mass.

Wait, but perhaps the mass of He-3 is known. Let me think, the standard mass of He-3 is about 3.016029 amu. Which would make option D:3.01603 amu. So that would be the correct answer. So my calculation gives 3.016955, but the actual known mass is 3.016029, which is very close. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the math. Let's compute the exact value.

3.945 MeV = (7.02505 - (4.00386 + m)) * 931.5.

So, 7.02505 -4.00386 =3.02119.

3.02119 - m =3.945 /931.5.

Compute 3.945 ÷931.5:

Let me compute 931.5 ×0.00423 = ?

0.004 ×931.5=3.726.

0.00023 ×931.5=0.214245.

So total 3.726 + 0.214245=3.940245 MeV.

Which is just a bit under 3.945. So to get 3.945, let's compute 3.945 -3.940245=0.004755 MeV more.

So, 0.004755 MeV /931.5 MeV/amu = approx 0.000005105 amu.

So, x=0.00423 + 0.000005105≈0.0042351 amu.

So, 3.02119 -m=0.0042351 → m=3.02119 -0.0042351=3.0169549 amu.

Which is approximately 3.016955 amu. But the known mass of He-3 is about 3.016029 amu. Hmm, that's a discrepancy. But perhaps the given data allows for this calculation. Alternatively, perhaps I messed up the signs.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the Q-value is the energy released, which is the mass difference times c², so the mass of the reactants is greater than the products by Q/(931.5). So, the equation should be:

sum reactants = sum products + Q/(931.5).

So, sum products = sum reactants - Q/(931.5).

So, m = sum products -4.00386.

sum products =7.02505 - (3.945/931.5) ≈7.02505 -0.004235=7.020815 amu.

Wait, no, sum products = sum reactants - Q/(931.5).

So, sum products =7.02505 - (3.945/931.5)=7.02505 -0.004235=7.020815 amu.

But sum products is 4.00386 + m =7.020815 → m=7.020815 -4.00386=3.016955 amu.

So same result. Hmm, but the known mass is 3.016029 amu. So perhaps the data given is approximate, and the closest option is D:3.01603 amu.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the mass of He-3, which we've calculated as approximately 3.016955 amu, but the options don't have that. Wait, looking at the options again:

Options:

A: 6.01888 amu

B:8.02245 amu

C:7.02505 amu

D:3.01603 amu

E:5.01222 amu

F:0.00423 amu

G:1.00782 amu

H:2.01410 amu

I:0.01696 amu

J:4.00386 amu

So, option D is 3.01603 amu, which is very close to our calculated 3.016955. The slight discrepancy might be due to rounding in the given masses or the Q-value. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait another thought: perhaps the reaction is written in the wrong direction. Because in reality, the reaction might be He-3 and He-4 combining, but the given reaction is Li-6 + H-1 → He-4 + He-3. So, perhaps the calculation is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the mass of the products is less than the reactants, hence the Q is positive.

Wait, perhaps I should write the equation as:

sum (reactants) - sum (products) = Q/(931.5)

Which is what I did.

So, I think the correct answer is approximately 3.016955 amu, but the closest option is D:3.01603 amu. However, there's another option: option I is 0.01696 amu, which is way off. So perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, wait a second. Let me check the calculation of 3.945 / 931.5.

3.945 ÷ 931.5 = ?

Let me compute this using a calculator approach:

931.5 × 0.00423 = ?

0.004 *931.5=3.726.

0.00023 *931.5=0.214245.

Total is 3.726+0.214245=3.940245 MeV.

But we have 3.945, which is 3.945-3.940245=0.004755 MeV left.

So, 0.004755 ÷ 931.5 = approx 0.000005105 amu.

So, 0.00423 + 0.000005105 ≈0.0042351.

So, 3.02119 -0.0042351=3.0169549 amu.

Hmm. So, the calculated mass is 3.0169549 amu, which is approximately 3.01695 amu. The option D is 3.01603, which is slightly lower. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D, and the slight difference is due to rounding.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation steps. Let me try another approach.

The mass of He-3 can be calculated as:

mass(He-3) = mass(Li-6) + mass(H-1) - mass(He-4) - Q/(931.5).

So,

6.01692 +1.00813 -4.00386 = (6.01692 +1.00813)=7.02505 -4.00386=3.02119 amu.

Now subtract Q/(931.5): 3.945/931.5=0.004235.

So, 3.02119 -0.004235=3.016955 amu.

Again, same result. So, perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but the closest option is D:3.01603 amu. Alternatively, perhaps the Q-value was given in a different unit, but I think it's in MeV.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the possibility that the question is asking for the mass of He-4, but that's given as 4.00386 amu, which is option J. But the question is about the light isotope, which is He-3.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is not among the options, but that's unlikely.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the reaction is written as He-3 + something, but no, the reaction is Li-6 + H-1 → He-4 + He-3.

So, I think the correct mass of He-3 is approximately 3.016955 amu, but the closest option is D:3.01603 amu. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is not present, but that's unlikely.

Wait, looking at the options again, option D is 3.01603 amu. So the difference between our calculation and the option is about 0.0009 amu, which is within possible rounding errors, especially considering the given data has four decimal places.

So, I think the correct answer is D: 3.01603 amu.
</think>

To calculate the mass of the light isotope of helium (_2He^3) in the given reaction, we use the relationship between the Q-value and the mass difference between reactants and products. The reaction is:

\[
_3\text{Li}^6 + _1\text{H}^1 \rightarrow _2\text{He}^4 + _2\text{He}^3
\]

### Given Data:
- Mass of _1H^1: \(1.00813 \, \text{amu}\)
- Mass of _2He^4: \(4.00386 \, \text{amu}\)
- Mass of _3Li^6: \(6.01692 \, \text{amu}\)
- Q-value: \(3.945 \, \text{MeV}\)
- Conversion factor: \(1 \, \text{amu} \approx 931.5 \, \text{MeV}/c^2\)

### Step 1: Calculate the total mass of reactants
\[
\text{Mass of reactants} = 6.01692 + 1.00813 = 7.02505 \, \text{amu}
\]

### Step 2: Express the Q-value in terms of mass difference
The Q-value is related to the mass difference by:
\[
Q = (\text{Mass of reactants} - \text{Mass of products}) \times 931.5
\]
Rearranging:
\[
\text{Mass of products} = \text{Mass of reactants} - \frac{Q}{931.5}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total mass of products
Substitute the values:
\[
\text{Mass of products} = 7.02505 - \frac{3.945}{931.5}
\]
\[
\frac{3.945}{931.5} \approx 0.004235 \, \text{amu}
\]
\[
\text{Mass of products} = 7.02505 - 0.004235 = 7.020815 \, \text{amu}
\]

### Step 4: Solve for the mass of _2He^3
The total mass of products is the sum of the masses of _2He^4 and _2He^3:
\[
\text{Mass of products} = 4.00386 + m
\]
Rearranging:
\[
m = \text{Mass of products} - 4.00386
\]
\[
m = 7.020815 - 4.00386 = 3.016955 \, \text{amu}
\]

### Step 5: Compare with the options
The calculated mass of _2He^3 is approximately \(3.016955 \, \text{amu}\). Among the given options, the closest value is:

**D: \(3.01603 \, \text{amu}\)**

The slight discrepancy is likely due to rounding or approximations in the given data.

**Answer:** D
