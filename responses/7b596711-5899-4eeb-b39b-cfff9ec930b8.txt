Question:

A seller listed real property for $500,000, which was set to expire on Aug.1. The current lessee of the premises, who had made substantial improvements to the property, wanted to buy at the full list price but needed extra time. He paid $10,000 for an option to be added to the lease, giving him an option to buy on or before Sept. 1. The option stated that all notices required under it "shall be deemed given if given in writing and delivered personally, delivered by commercial delivery service, or by certified mail return receipt requested, to the party to receive the Notice" That notice was required by Sept. 1. Buyer called Seller on Aug. 25 and told her that he was exercising the option, but Seller did not remember the words used. The Buyer sent written intent to exercise it by first class mail on Aug. 29 but the Seller later testified that she did not receive it until September 3. On September 10 she notified Buyer that the option expired and the deal was off. Buyer filed a specific performance action to compel the transaction. Is it likely that the Equity Court will grant the request for specific performance?

Options:

A: No, because the option explicitly required that notices be delivered by one of the stated forms, and first class mail was not one of them.
B: Yes, the delay was minimal, the lessee would suffer hardship, and the wording of the notice requirement did not absolutely require one of the stated forms of notice.
C: Yes, because the Buyer made a good faith effort to notify the Seller within the required time.
D: No, because option contracts are strictly enforced and even a one-day delay cannot be allowed due to the need to have commercial predictability in such transactions.
E: Yes, because the Seller was informed of the Buyer's intent to exercise the option, regardless of the method of delivery.
F: No, because the Buyer did not fulfill the terms of the option within the allotted time.
G: No, because the Seller did not recall the phone conversation, and there's no proof of the same.
H: No, because the Seller would be prejudiced by having to sell after the option date.
I: Yes, the Seller was informed by phone call, which can be considered as personal delivery.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the Equity Court will grant specific performance in this real estate scenario. Let me break down the facts and the legal issues step by step.

First, the seller listed the property for $500,000 with an expiration on August 1. The current lessee, who has made improvements, wanted to buy at the list price but needed more time. He paid $10,000 for an option to be added to the lease, allowing him to buy by September 1. 

The key part here is the notice requirement in the option. It states that notices must be in writing and delivered personally, via a commercial delivery service, or by certified mail with a return receipt. So, the notice methods are pretty specific.

Now, the buyer called the seller on August 25 to say he's exercising the option. The seller didn't remember the exact words used. Then, the buyer sent a written notice via first-class mail on August 29. The seller didn't receive it until September 3. On September 10, the seller notified the buyer that the option had expired and the deal was off.

The buyer is suing for specific performance, which is a remedy that compels the seller to go through with the sale. Specific performance is typically granted when a contract is clear and there's a remedy at law that's inadequate, like when the subject matter is unique (like real estate).

Looking at the options, the main issue is whether the buyer properly exercised the option. The option requires notices to be delivered by certain methods: personal delivery, commercial service, or certified mail. First-class mail wasn't listed. So, if the buyer used first-class mail, that might not meet the requirement.

The buyer sent the notice on August 29 via first-class mail. The seller didn't get it until September 3. The option expired on September 1, so the notice came a day late. But the seller testified that she didn't receive it until September 3, which is after the deadline.

Wait, but the option says the notice must be delivered by one of the specified methods. First-class mail isn't one, so using that method would be a breach. Even if the buyer tried in good faith, the method matters. So, the notice wasn't delivered in the required way, making the exercise of the option ineffective.

Also, the buyer called on August 25, but the seller didn't remember the conversation. So, the oral notice might not count because the option requires written notices. The written notice via first-class mail came after the deadline, so it's too late.

Looking at the options:

Option A says no because first-class mail wasn't allowed. That seems correct because the option specifies the methods, and first-class isn't one of them.

Option B suggests yes because the delay was minimal and the lessee would be in hardship. But the problem is the method of delivery wasn't correct. The delay might be minor, but following the terms is crucial, especially in real estate.

Option C says yes because the buyer tried in good faith. But good faith doesn't necessarily override the contract terms. If the method isn't specified, it doesn't matter how hard the buyer tried.

Option D is about strict enforcement, which is true, but the delay here is more than a day; the notice was after the deadline.

Option E says yes because the seller was informed by phone. But the option requires written notices, so the phone call alone might not suffice unless it triggered a written notice within the timeframe.

Option F says no because the buyer didn't fulfill the terms within the time. That's accurate because the notice was late and via an incorrect method.

Option G says no because the seller didn't recall the phone call. But the issue is whether the written notice was timely delivered, which it wasn't.

Option I says yes because the phone call counts as personal delivery. But the option requires written notices, so the oral call without a written follow-up might not meet the requirement.

So, the main issue is that the buyer didn't deliver the notice via a method specified in the option. First-class mail isn't allowed, and the oral call might not count as a written notice. Therefore, the buyer didn't properly exercise the option, making the case for specific performance unlikely.

The key issue is whether the buyer properly exercised the option by delivering the notice via first-class mail, which was not one of the allowed methods (personal delivery, commercial service, or certified mail). Since the notice was untimely and delivered via an unauthorized method, the option was not effectively exercised. Therefore, the court is unlikely to grant specific performance.
