Question:

Summer, a single individual, had a net operating loss of $20,000 three years ago. A Code Sec. 1244 stock loss made up three-fourths of that loss. Summer had no taxable income from that year until the current year. In the current year, Summer has gross income of $80,000 and sustains another loss of $50,000 on Code Sec. 1244 stock. Assuming that Summer can carry the entire $20,000 net operating loss to the current year, what is the amount and character of the Code Sec. 1244 loss that Summer can deduct for the current year?

Options:

A: $20,000 capital loss.
B: $30,000 ordinary loss.
C: $40,000 capital loss.
D: $40,000 ordinary loss.
E: $30,000 capital loss.
F: $35,000 ordinary loss.
G: $50,000 capital loss.
H: $20,000 ordinary loss.
I: $50,000 ordinary loss.
J: $35,000 capital loss.

Okay, so Summer is a single individual. Let me try to understand the problem step by step. 

Three years ago, she had a net operating loss of $20,000. A Code Sec. 1244 stock loss made up three-fourths of that. So, first, I need to figure out how much of that $20k was the 1244 loss. Three-fourths of 20k is 15k. So, she had an $15,000 loss from 1244 stock and the remaining $5k from other sources.

Now, she had no taxable income from that year until now. So, up until the current year, she hasn't had any income to offset with that loss. But in the current year, she has gross income of $80k and another loss of $50k on 1244 stock.

The question is about how much and what kind of loss she can deduct in the current year. The options are combinations of ordinary and capital losses, so I need to figure out which applies here.

Wait, Code Sec. 1244 stock is a specific type. I remember that 1244 losses are treated as ordinary losses if certain conditions are met. But wait, I think that if the loss is more than $500 (which is indexed for inflation, but assuming it's the same here), it's treated as a capital loss. Or is it that any loss on 1244 stock is an ordinary loss unless it's a capital loss? Hmm, maybe I got that wrong.

Wait, no, I think that for 1244 stock, if the loss is more than $500, it's a capital loss. But wait, that's not right. Let me think again. Oh, no, actually, for 1244 stock, the loss is treated as an ordinary loss if it's on the sale of stock held for more than one year, but only up to $500. Any excess over $500 is a capital loss. Wait, no, I'm confusing it. 

Wait, no. Actually, under Section 1244, if you sell 1244 stock at a loss, the loss is treated as an ordinary loss, but only up to $500. Any loss above that is a capital loss. So, for example, if someone sells 1244 stock and loses $1,000, they can deduct $500 as an ordinary loss and $500 as a capital loss.

But wait, in this case, Summer had a net operating loss three years ago where 1244 stock accounted for 3/4, which is $15k. So that $15k would have been a loss on 1244 stock. Since it's more than $500, the excess over $500 would be a capital loss. Wait, but when you have a net operating loss, how does that work with 1244 stock?

Wait, no. Wait, in the context of a net operating loss, the 1244 stock loss is treated as a business loss, which is an ordinary loss. Because net operating loss (NOL) is for a business, and 1244 stock is considered a trade or business loss if it's part of the business operations. Alternatively, if the stock is held for investment, it's a capital loss. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, no, 1244 stock is specifically for small corporations. If Summer is a shareholder in a small corporation and holds the stock, and the loss arises from the business, then that loss would be treated as an ordinary loss as part of her NOL. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, let's break it down. Three years ago, she had a NOL of $20k, of which $15k was from 1244 stock. So that $15k would be an ordinary loss, part of her NOL. She carried that $20k loss forward to the current year because she had no income in between.

In the current year, she has $80k gross income. She also has another $50k loss on 1244 stock. Now, she can carry back the $20k NOL from three years ago. So she can deduct $20k against her current income, which would bring her income down to $60k.

Now, the question is about the $50k loss on 1244 stock in the current year. How much of that can she deduct, and as what type of loss.

Wait, but first, she can carry back the NOL she had three years ago. That NOL includes $15k of 1244 loss. So she's using that $20k NOL to offset her current income. Now, she also has a new loss of $50k on 1244 stock this year.

But wait, the problem says that she can carry the entire $20k NOL to the current year. So she's deducting $20k from her $80k income, leaving her with $60k. Now, she has another $50k loss on 1244 stock. But how does that apply?

I think the key here is understanding the treatment of the 1244 loss in the current year. So the $50k loss on 1244 stock in the current year. Let me recall: for a 1244 loss, if the loss is more than $500, the first $500 is an ordinary loss, and the rest is a capital loss. So for $50k, the first $500 is ordinary, and $49,500 is capital.

But wait, that's if it's a loss on the sale of 1244 stock. Alternatively, if the loss is due to insolvency or other factors, it might be treated differently, but in this case, it's just a loss on the stock.

So, in the current year, she has a $50k loss on 1244 stock. So, $500 is ordinary, $49,500 is capital. But wait, she's single. The maximum capital loss she can deduct is $3,000 against ordinary income, with the rest carrying over. But wait, she's using her NOL first, right?

Wait, no. The NOL is used to offset income before considering other deductions. So, she uses the $20k NOL to reduce her $80k to $60k. Then, she can deduct her current year losses.

But wait, the $50k loss is a loss she incurred this year. So, first, she can deduct the $50k loss, but subject to the rules. But she can also deduct her NOL. Wait, no, NOL is a prior year loss, so she can carry it back to this year.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me think again.

She has a NOL of $20k from three years ago, which she can carry back to the current year. She uses that $20k to offset her $80k income, bringing it down to $60k.

Then, in the current year, she has a $50k loss on 1244 stock. So, she can deduct that $50k loss. But what's the character of that loss?

Wait, 1244 stock loss is treated as a capital loss unless it's part of a trade or business. But if Summer is a shareholder in a small corporation and the stock was acquired in the purchase of the business, then the loss might be treated as ordinary. But I think in general, the 1244 loss is a capital loss unless it's part of a trade or business, in which case it's ordinary.

Wait, no, actually, under Section 1244, a loss on the sale of qualifying 1244 stock is treated as an ordinary loss up to $500, and the excess is a capital loss. But if the loss is due to the company going bankrupt and the stock becoming worthless, it might be treated as an ordinary loss. Or if it's part of a business.

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the 1244 loss is treated as an ordinary loss regardless because it's part of her business operations.

Wait, maybe I should look at the specific rules. Under 1244, a loss on the sale of qualifying stock is an ordinary loss up to $500, and the excess is a capital loss. So, for example, if someone sells 1244 stock for $1,000 loss, they can deduct $500 as ordinary and $500 as capital.

But in this case, Summer had a $15k loss three years ago as part of her NOL. That would have been an ordinary loss because it was part of her business operations. Now, in the current year, she has another $50k loss on 1244 stock. So, that would be treated as an ordinary loss up to $500, and the rest as capital loss.

Wait, but she can only deduct up to $500 as ordinary, and the rest as capital. But she has $50k, so $500 is ordinary, $49,500 is capital.

But wait, she has a net income after using the NOL of $60k. So, she can deduct her current year losses against that.

But she's single, so her capital loss deduction is limited. Normally, she can deduct up to $3,000 of capital losses against ordinary income. So, in this case, she has $49,500 capital loss. But she can only deduct $3,000 against her $60k income, and the rest would carry over.

Wait, but wait, she has $50k loss on 1244 stock, which is split into $500 ordinary and $49,500 capital. But she can also carry back the prior year's NOL.

Wait, maybe I'm complicating this. Let me see what the question is specifically asking. It says, what is the amount and character of the Code Sec. 1244 loss that Summer can deduct for the current year.

So, the current year's 1244 loss is $50k. How much can she deduct as ordinary or capital.

I think the first $500 is ordinary, and the rest is capital. So, she can deduct $500 as ordinary loss, and the remaining $49,500 as capital loss. But she can only deduct up to $3,000 of capital loss against ordinary income. Her ordinary income after NOL is $60k.

Wait, but wait, she had a NOL of $20k which she uses to offset her $80k income, bringing it down to $60k. Then, she has the current year's 1244 loss of $50k. So, she can deduct that $50k as a loss. But how much is ordinary and how much is capital?

Wait, perhaps the $50k loss is treated as a capital loss because it's a loss on the sale of stock, which is a capital asset. Therefore, the entire $50k would be a capital loss. But wait, no, because 1244 stock is a special case.

Under 1244, if the loss is on the sale of qualifying stock, the first $500 is ordinary, the rest is capital. So, in this case, $500 is ordinary, $49,500 is capital.

But then, she can only deduct $500 as ordinary loss, and $3,000 as capital loss against her $60k income, leaving $46,500 to carry forward.

Wait, but wait, she has $50k loss this year. She can deduct the $500 ordinary loss against her $60k income, reducing it to $59,500. Then, she can deduct $3,000 of capital loss, bringing it down to $56,500. The remaining $46,500 capital loss carries forward.

But the question is about the amount and character of the Code Sec. 1244 loss she can deduct. So, from her $50k loss, she can deduct $500 as ordinary and $3,000 as capital against her income, totaling $3,500. But that doesn't seem to match the options.

Wait, but the options don't have $3,500. Let me look at the options again.

Options are:

A: $20,000 capital loss.

B: $30,000 ordinary loss.

C: $40,000 capital loss.

D: $40,000 ordinary loss.

E: $30,000 capital loss.

F: $35,000 ordinary loss.

G: $50,000 capital loss.

H: $20,000 ordinary loss.

I: $50,000 ordinary loss.

J: $35,000 capital loss.

Wait, none of these options mention a $500 ordinary and $3k capital. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the treatment.

Alternatively, perhaps the 1244 loss in the current year is treated as an ordinary loss because it's part of a trade or business. For instance, if Summer is a shareholder in a small corporation and the 1244 stock is part of her business, then the loss might be treated as an ordinary loss.

Wait, but 1244 stock is specifically for small corporations. If Summer is a shareholder and the loss is due to the business, then the loss would be ordinary. So, perhaps the entire $50k loss is an ordinary loss.

But wait, that's not correct because 1244 loss is treated as ordinary up to $500, and the rest is capital. But if the loss is part of a trade or business, perhaps it's all ordinary.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to approach this differently.

The key points:

- Three years ago: NOL of $20k, 3/4 ($15k) from 1244 stock. So, that $15k is an ordinary loss (as part of NOL).

- Current year: Gross income $80k, loss of $50k on 1244 stock.

- She can carry the entire $20k NOL to current year, so her income is reduced by $20k to $60k.

- Now, the question is about the current year's 1244 loss deduction.

I think the $50k loss on 1244 stock is treated as an ordinary loss up to $500, and the rest is capital loss. So, she can deduct $500 as ordinary loss and $49,500 as capital loss.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct approach is that since the prior NOL was $20k, including $15k of 1244 loss, and she's using that to reduce her current income, the current year's loss is separate.

Wait, but the question is about the character of the current year's 1244 loss. So, she has a $50k loss on 1244 stock in the current year. How much can she deduct, and as what?

If she's a shareholder in a small corporation, the loss on 1244 stock is treated as an ordinary loss, regardless of the amount. Because 1244 stock is for small corporations, and the loss is considered a business loss.

Wait, but I thought that up to $500 is ordinary, and the rest is capital. But perhaps in the context of being part of a business, the entire loss is ordinary.

Alternatively, perhaps the $50k loss is a capital loss because it's a loss on the stock, which is a capital asset. But I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think about the rules again. Under 1244, if a shareholder sells stock of a qualifying small corporation at a loss, the loss is treated as an ordinary loss up to $500, and the excess is a capital loss. So, regardless of whether it's part of a business, the first $500 is ordinary, the rest capital.

So, in the current year, she has a $50k loss on 1244 stock. So, $500 is ordinary, $49,500 is capital.

But wait, she can only deduct up to $3,000 of capital losses against her ordinary income. So, her $49,500 capital loss would only allow her to deduct $3k, with $46,500 carried forward.

But the question is about the amount and character of the 1244 loss she can deduct. So, the total loss is $50k, but she can only deduct $500 as ordinary and $3k as capital, totaling $3,500. But none of the options match that.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me look at the options again. Option E is $30k capital loss. Option G is $50k capital loss. Option B is $30k ordinary. Option I is $50k ordinary.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is that the entire $50k loss is treated as a capital loss. Because when you sell stock, it's a capital loss unless it's a business loss. But if it's part of a business, it's ordinary.

Wait, but she's a shareholder, so the loss on the stock would be a capital loss unless it's part of the business operations. Alternatively, perhaps the 1244 loss is treated as an ordinary loss regardless because it's part of her business.

I'm getting stuck, so perhaps I should look for another approach. Let me think about the total deductions.

She has a NOL of $20k which she can deduct from her $80k income, bringing it down to $60k. Then, she has a current year loss of $50k on 1244 stock. How much can she deduct of that?

If the $50k is a capital loss, she can deduct up to $3k against her ordinary income, reducing her $60k to $56.7k. The rest would carry over.

But the question is about the character of the loss she can deduct. So, she can deduct $3k as capital loss, but the rest is carried forward.

But the options don't have $3k. Alternatively, perhaps the entire $50k loss is an ordinary loss because it's part of her business. So, she can deduct the full $50k as an ordinary loss. But that would bring her income down to $10k, which seems too much.

Wait, but the NOL is $20k. So she uses that to bring her income to $60k. Then, the current year's loss is $50k. If that's an ordinary loss, she can deduct it entirely, bringing her income to $10k. But that seems possible, but I'm not sure if the 1244 loss is treated as ordinary.

Alternatively, perhaps the current year's 1244 loss is treated as a capital loss. So, she can deduct up to $3k, bringing her income to $56.7k, with the rest carried forward.

But the options don't have that. The options are in multiples of $5k or $10k, mostly.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think about the $50k loss in the current year. Since she can carry back the $20k NOL, which includes $15k of 1244 loss, but the current year's $50k loss is separate.

Wait, but the question is about the character of the current year's 1244 loss. So, the $50k loss. How is that treated?

I think the key is that for 1244 stock, the loss is treated as an ordinary loss up to $500, and the excess is capital. So, in the current year, she can deduct $500 as ordinary and $49,500 as capital. But she can only deduct $3k of capital loss against her $60k income, so she deducts $500 + $3k = $3.5k. But none of the options match that.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the entire $50k is treated as a capital loss because it's a loss on a capital asset (the stock). So, she can deduct up to $3k as a capital loss, with the rest carried forward.

But the options don't have that either. Alternatively, perhaps the $50k loss is treated as an ordinary loss because it's part of her business, so she can deduct the full $50k as an ordinary loss, but that would reduce her income to $10k, which seems too much.

Wait, but the NOL was $20k, bringing her income down to $60k. Then, she can deduct her current year's loss. If that's an ordinary loss, she can deduct the full $50k, bringing her income to $60k - $50k = $10k. But that seems high, but perhaps possible.

But the options have option I as $50k ordinary loss. So, is that the answer?

Alternatively, perhaps the 1244 loss in the current year is treated as a capital loss, so she can deduct up to $3k, but the options don't have that. The closest is option E: $30k capital loss, which doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is that the prior NOL of $20k includes $15k ordinary loss (1244) and $5k other. Now, in the current year, she has a $50k loss on 1244 stock. So, the current year's 1244 loss is treated as an ordinary loss up to $500, and the rest as capital.

But then, she can deduct $500 as ordinary. So, her income is $60k - $500 = $59,500. Then, she can deduct up to $3k of capital loss, bringing it to $56,500, with $46,500 carried forward.

But the question is about the amount and character of the Code Sec. 1244 loss she can deduct. So, she can deduct $500 as ordinary and $3k as capital, but that's $3.5k, which isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is that she can deduct $30k as a capital loss. Let me think: the current year's 1244 loss is $50k. Of that, $500 is ordinary, $49,500 is capital. But she can only deduct $3k of capital loss. So, she can deduct $500 + $3k = $3.5k. But the options don't have that.

Alternatively, perhaps the $50k loss is treated as a capital loss, so she can deduct up to $3k, leaving $47k carried forward. But the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps the key is that the 1244 loss in the current year is treated as an ordinary loss because it's part of her business. So, she can deduct the full $50k as an ordinary loss, bringing her income down to $10k. But that seems too much, and the options have I as $50k ordinary loss.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is that she can deduct $30k as a capital loss, but I'm not sure how that comes about.

Wait, perhaps the $50k loss is split into $500 ordinary and $49,500 capital. But she can only deduct $3k of capital loss against her $60k income. So, she can deduct $500 + $3k = $3.5k. But again, that's not an option.

Wait, maybe the answer is that she can deduct $30k as a capital loss, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is that she can deduct the entire $50k as a capital loss. So, option G: $50k capital loss.

But I'm not fully confident. I think I need to make a decision based on the options given.
</think>

The problem involves determining the amount and character of the Code Sec. 1244 loss that Summer can deduct in the current year. Summer had a net operating loss (NOL) of $20,000 three years ago, of which $15,000 was from a Code Sec. 1244 stock loss. She carried this entire $20,000 NOL to the current year, reducing her $80,000 gross income to $60,000. In the current year, she incurred another $50,000 loss on Code Sec. 1244 stock. 

Under Code Sec. 1244, losses on qualifying stock are treated as ordinary losses up to $500, with the excess treated as capital losses. Therefore, the $50,000 loss in the current year would be split into $500 as an ordinary loss and $49,500 as a capital loss. However, Summer can only deduct up to $3,000 of capital losses against her ordinary income. Thus, she can deduct $500 as an ordinary loss and $3,000 as a capital loss, totaling $3,500. 

The options provided do not include this exact amount. However, based on the rules and the options given, the most plausible answer is that the entire $50,000 loss is treated as a capital loss, allowing her to deduct $3,000 against her income, with the remainder carried forward. 

ANSWER: E
