Okay, so I've got this probability problem here, and I need to figure out the expected waiting time E(N) until the next occurrence of X0. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the problem says that X0, X1, X2, etc., are drawn i.i.d. from p(x), where x is in {1,2,3,…,100}. So each Xi is an independent and identically distributed random variable taking values from 1 to 100. That means each number has some probability distribution, but I don't think the specific form of p(x) matters here because the question might be general.

Wait, N is the waiting time to the next occurrence of X0. Hmm, so X0 is the first value, and we're looking for how long until X0 appears again. So if X0 is, say, 5, then N is the number of trials until we get another 5 after X0. But since each trial is independent, the next occurrence of X0 could be in the next trial or any subsequent trial.

Wait a second, but since N is the waiting time, it's like a geometric distribution scenario. In the geometric distribution, the expected number of trials to get the first success is 1/p, where p is the probability of success on each trial. Here, the "success" would be getting X0 again.

So, what's the probability of drawing X0 again? Since the variables are i.i.d., the probability that any Xi equals X0 is the same as the probability that X0 equals X0, which is 1, but wait, that's not right. Wait, no, each Xi is a random variable, so the probability that Xi equals X0 depends on the distribution p(x).

Wait, no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Wait, X0 is a specific value, say k, where k is between 1 and 100. Then the probability that any Xi equals k is p(k). So the probability that the next trial (X1) equals X0 is p(k), and so on. So the waiting time until the next occurrence of X0 is a geometric random variable with parameter p = p(k). The expectation of N would then be 1/p(k).

But wait, the problem says that x ∈ {1,2,…,100}, but it doesn't specify the distribution p(x). So maybe p(x) is uniform, meaning each x has probability 1/100. That would make sense if it's not specified otherwise.

If p(x) is uniform, then p(k) = 1/100 for each k. So the expected waiting time E(N) would be 1/(1/100) = 100. So the expectation is 100.

Wait, but wait a minute. The problem says "the waiting time to the next occurrence of X0." So X0 is the first trial, and then we start waiting for the next occurrence. So the next occurrence could be in X1, X2, etc. So the number of trials until the first success (another X0) is geometric with p = 1/100, so the expectation is 100. So that would make the answer 100, which is option H.

But wait, let me think again. The geometric distribution models the number of trials until the first success, which includes the successful trial. So E(N) is 1/p. If p=1/100, E(N)=100.

Alternatively, sometimes the geometric distribution is defined as the number of failures before the first success, which would have expectation (1-p)/p. But in this case, since the problem refers to the waiting time until the next occurrence, I think it's the standard geometric distribution where we count the number of trials until the first success, including the successful one. So the expectation is 1/p.

Therefore, if p=1/100, E(N)=100. So the answer should be H: 100.0.

The problem involves calculating the expected waiting time \( E(N) \) until the next occurrence of \( X_0 \) in a sequence of i.i.d. random variables \( X_0, X_1, X_2, \ldots \) where each \( X_i \) takes values in \{1, 2, ..., 100\}. Since the variables are i.i.d., the probability distribution \( p(x) \) is uniform, meaning each value has a probability of \( \frac{1}{100} \).

The waiting time \( N \) follows a geometric distribution with success probability \( p = \frac{1}{100} \), where the expectation of a geometric distribution is \( \frac{1}{p} \). Substituting \( p = \frac{1}{100} \), we find \( E(N) = 100 \).

Thus, the answer is:

H: 100.0
