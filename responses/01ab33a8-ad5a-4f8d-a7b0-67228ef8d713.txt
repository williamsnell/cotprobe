Okay, so I need to figure out what percentage agriculture contributes to the total US GDP as of 2015. Hmm, I'm not exactly sure, but I'll try to think through it step by step.

First, I remember that the US economy is quite large and diverse, so I don't think any single sector dominates it. Agriculture might not be the biggest part, but it's definitely important. I think the agricultural sector includes farming, livestock, and related industries, but I'm not sure how that translates into GDP.

I've heard before that in many developed countries, the agricultural sector's contribution to GDP isn't as high as in developing nations where farming is a larger part of the economy. So maybe the percentage is on the lower side. Let me think about other sectors. Services, like healthcare, education, and finance, are usually the biggest contributors. Manufacturing is another major part, but I'm not sure about its exact percentage. Then there's the tech industry, which has been growing, but again, not sure how that compares to agriculture.

From what I recall, the US agricultural sector is efficient and productive, but it's not the largest part of the economy. So the percentage might be in the single digits. Let me think about possible numbers. I've heard that in the US, agriculture's share of GDP has been decreasing over time as the economy becomes more service-oriented. So maybe it's around 1% or 2%? Or perhaps a bit higher, like 5% or so.

Wait, I think I remember reading that as of a few years ago, agriculture was about 1% of GDP. That seems low, but considering how large the overall economy is, it might make sense. For example, if the GDP is around $18 trillion, 1% would be $180 billion. That sounds plausible for the agricultural sector.

Looking at the options, the choices are A:20%, B:1%, C:12%, D:15%, E:7%, F:25%, G:9%, H:5%, I:30%, J:3%. Based on my reasoning, 1% seems too low, but maybe it's correct. Alternatively, 5% or 7% could be possible. Wait, I think I might have mixed up the numbers. Let me try to recall any specific data points.

I think the agricultural sector in the US is actually a bit more than 1%, maybe around 1.5% or so. But since the options don't have 1.5%, the closest lower option is B:1%, and the next higher is H:5%. I'm a bit uncertain here. Alternatively, maybe it's around 2%, but that's not an option either.

Another angle: I remember that the US exports a lot of agricultural products, which might contribute to a higher GDP share. But even so, considering the size of the economy, it's probably not more than 5%. So looking at the options, B:1%, H:5%, J:3% are possibilities. I'm trying to remember if it's closer to 1% or higher. I think I've heard it's about 1%, so B might be the answer. Alternatively, I might be confusing it with a different year or country.

Wait, I think I should check my reasoning again. If it's 1%, that's about $180 billion in 2015. Does that sound right? I think the agricultural sector, including food processing, might be a bit larger, but perhaps the pure agricultural output is around 1%. Or maybe the entire food and agriculture sector is higher, but the question specifies agriculture, so maybe just the farming part.

I'm leaning towards B:1%, but I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, maybe it's 5%, which is H. I'm a bit torn here. I think I'll go with B:1% because I recall that the agricultural sector's contribution to GDP is relatively small in developed countries like the US.

The agricultural sector's contribution to the US GDP is relatively small compared to other sectors, especially in a developed economy like the US. Based on the reasoning, the percentage is likely in the single digits. Considering the options and recalling data, the closest and most plausible answer is **B:1%**.

Answer: B
