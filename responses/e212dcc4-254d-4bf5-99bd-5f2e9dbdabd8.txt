Question:

This question refers to the following information.
"When the gods fashioned Gilgamesh*, to him they gave a perfect form. The glorious sun Shamash bestowed upon him glory; Adad the terrible god of storms bestowed upon him courage. The great gods perfected his magnificence beyond all others, terrible like the great wild bull. Two thirds god they made him; one third man they made him.
Of Uruk, its great rampart he built, and the wall of the sacred Eanna temple, the holy sanctuary. Behold the outer walls which gleam with the brilliance of copper; see the inner wall which none might rival. Touch the threshold stoneâ€”it is from ancient days. Goest thou into the Eanna temple, yea, the dwelling place of Ishtar, the like of which no subsequent king or living man might equal. Ascend and walk about on the wall of Uruk, inspect the corner-stone, and examine its brick-work, whether its wall is not made of burned brick, and its foundation laid by the Seven Sages. One third for city, one third for garden, one third for field, and a precinct for the temple of Ishtar. These parts and the precinct comprise Uruk."
The Epic of Gilgamesh, ca. 2100 B.C.E.
*Gilgamesh was a king of Uruk.

Okay, so I have this question about the origins of epic poetry, specifically referring to the Epic of Gilgamesh. I need to choose the correct option from A to J. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the question is asking about the origins. So I should think about when and how epic poetry like Gilgamesh began. I remember that the Epic of Gilgamesh is one of the oldest known literary works, dating back to around 2100 B.C.E. in Mesopotamia. That's Sumerian times, right?

Epic poetry is a form of long narrative poetry that tells a heroic story. In the case of Gilgamesh, it's about the king of Uruk and his adventures. So, how did such a work come to be? What social or cultural conditions allowed for its creation?

Looking at the options:

A: Merchant class. Hmm, merchants might have had wealth, but I'm not sure they were the primary patrons of such grand epics. Maybe not the main reason.

B: Priestly class communicating with gods. Priests were important in ancient cultures, especially in Mesopotamia. They were literate and performed rituals, but how does that tie into epic poetry? Maybe they were the ones who preserved the stories, but were they the originators?

C: Religious caste recording God-Kings' deeds. This sounds similar to option B but more specific. If the priests were recording the deeds of kings who were seen as divine, that could make sense. But I'm not sure if that's the origin or just a part of their role.

D: Democratic society choosing stories. That seems unlikely because ancient Mesopotamia wasn't democratic. Kings and priests had more power in deciding what was recorded.

E: Explorers documenting journeys. Epic poetry often involves journeys, but the Epic of Gilgamesh isn't just about exploration. It's more about kings and divine heroes. So maybe not explorers.

F: Noble class commissioning poems. Nobles or kings might commission works to immortalize their history, but the Epic of Gilgamesh is more about a king's legend than just family history. Plus, it's a longer, more complex work.

G: Literate class of scribes. Scribes were crucial because they were the ones who could write and record texts. The development of writing (cuneiform) in Mesopotamia allowed for the creation and preservation of such epics. So scribes would have been the ones to write them down, but was their rise the origin of epics?

H: Agricultural society supporting poets. Agriculture did provide the resources for surplus and urbanization, which allowed for a literate class. But how directly does that link to the creation of epic poetry?

I: Warrior elite whose deeds were praised. Warriors' deeds are common in epics, but Gilgamesh is a king, not just a warrior. Plus, the epic includes mythical elements beyond just warrior exploits.

J: Scholarly class translating oral stories. This makes sense because many epics started as oral traditions. Scribes would then write them down, preserving them for posterity.

Wait, but the question is about the origins. So perhaps the rise of a literate class (G) allowed for the recording of these stories, which were previously oral. Alternatively, the scholarly class (J) might have been the ones to take oral tales and write them.

Looking back, the Epic of Gilgamesh was originally oral, passed down through generations before being written. So the rise of a scholarly or literate class would have been necessary to transcribe these stories. Scribes, who were part of the scholarly or literate class, would have been key in this process.

Option G says the rise of a literate class of scribes in cities who could record poems. That seems directly related because without scribes, the poems couldn't be written down. But option J is about translating oral stories into written form, which also sounds relevant.

I'm a bit torn between G and J. The Epic of Gilgamesh was written down by scribes, but it was based on an oral tradition. So the origin of epic poetry might be tied to the ability to write, which came with the rise of scribes (G), or it's the process of scholars writing down oral tales (J).

Wait, the question is about the origins of epic poetry. So the origin would be the transition from oral to written form. That would require a class of people who could write, which were the scribes (G). Alternatively, the scholars (J) who translated oral stories into writing.

But I think the rise of scribes (G) is more about the capability to record, while J is about translating existing oral stories. The origin of epic poetry as a written form would be due to the scribes being able to write it down. So perhaps G is the better answer.

Alternatively, some argue that the transition from oral to written allowed for the creation of epics as written literature, so the rise of scribes (G) was key.

Wait, but the options are about the origins. So when scribes became a class, they could write epics, which were previously only oral. Therefore, G seems correct.

But I'm not entirely sure. Another angle: in early Mesopotamian society, the scribes were often part of the priestly class. So maybe the rise of a priestly class (B) allowed for the recording of such epics, as they were literate and had the means to write them.

But option B says they had the power to communicate with gods, which might relate more to their role in religious functions, not necessarily the creation of epics. The creation and recording might have been done by scribes, who were separate from the priests.

So considering all this, I think option G is the best answer because the rise of scribes enabled the recording of epics like Gilgamesh.

The origins of epic poetry, such as the Epic of Gilgamesh, can be traced to the rise of a literate class of scribes in ancient Mesopotamian cities. These scribes, who were skilled in writing and record-keeping, played a crucial role in transitioning oral traditions into written form. The development of cuneiform allowed them to document and preserve complex narratives, enabling the creation of epic poetry as a written literary form. Thus, the emergence of scribes facilitated the recording and dissemination of such works.
