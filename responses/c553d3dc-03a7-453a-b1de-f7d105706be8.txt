Okay, so I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read it carefully. The question says that y is a positive integer, like 1, 2, 3, etc. The program starts with result set to 0. Then there's a REPEAT loop that runs 3 times. Inside that loop, there's another REPEAT loop that runs y times, and each time, it increments result by 1.

Hmm, so I think the result is being increased by 1 each time the inner loop runs. Let me break it down. The outer loop repeats 3 times, and each time, the inner loop runs y times. So for each of the 3 outer iterations, the inner loop adds y to the result. So total result should be 3 multiplied by y.

Wait, let me visualize this. Let's say y is 2. Then, the inner loop runs twice each time the outer loop runs. Since the outer loop runs three times, the inner loop runs 3 * 2 = 6 times. So result would be 6, which is 3*2. So the formula should be 3y.

Looking at the options, option A is 3y. That makes sense. Let me check another example to be sure. If y is 3, the inner loop runs 3 times each outer loop iteration. So 3 outer loops * 3 inner loops = 9 increments. 3*3 is 9, which matches. So yes, the answer should be A.

The program increments `result` by 1 each time the inner loop runs. The inner loop runs `y` times for each of the 3 outer loop iterations, resulting in `3 * y` total increments.

Answer: A
