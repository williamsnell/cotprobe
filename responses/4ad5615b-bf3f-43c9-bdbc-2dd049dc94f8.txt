Okay, so I have this chemistry question in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. The question is about the oxidation states of group 13 elements. Let me try to break it down.

The question asks: "The +1 oxidation state is more stable than the +3 oxidation state for which group 13 element?" The options are A to J, with various elements listed.

First, I should remember what group 13 elements are. Group 13 in the periodic table includes elements like Boron (B), Aluminum (Al), Gallium (Ga), Indium (In), Thallium (Tl), and also some others like C, N, Si, P, etc.? Wait, no, wait a second. Actually, group 13 is also known as the Boron group. So elements like Boron, Aluminum, Gallium, Indium, Thallium are the main group 13 elements. The others like Carbon, Nitrogen, etc., are actually in other groups. Hmm, so maybe the options include some elements that aren't group 13, but I need to focus on the group 13 ones.

Wait, the question specifies group 13 elements, so the correct answer must be one of the group 13 elements. Let me check the options again:

Options:
A: Al (Aluminum)
B: Tl (Thallium)
C: C (Carbon) – not group 13
D: B (Boron)
E: Si (Silicon) – group 14
F: P (Phosphorus) – group 15
G: N (Nitrogen) – group 15
H: Ga (Gallium)
I: In (Indium)
J: As (Arsenic) – group 15

So the group 13 elements in the options are A, B, D, H, I. The others are from different groups, so probably not the right answer.

Now, the question is about the stability of +1 vs +3 oxidation states. For group 13 elements, the common oxidation states are +3, and sometimes +1, especially for elements in the lower end of the group. For example, Boron usually is +3, but I'm not sure about others. Wait, I think in some cases, especially for heavier elements, they can exhibit lower oxidation states more readily.

Let me think about each group 13 element:

1. Boron (B): Typically +3 oxidation state. I don't think it commonly shows +1, so maybe not the answer.

2. Aluminum (Al): Usually +3, but sometimes +1, especially in compounds like AlH4^- or maybe in some complexes? But I'm not sure if +1 is more stable than +3 for Al. I think +3 is more common and stable for Al.

3. Gallium (Ga): I think Ga can show both +3 and occasionally +1. But does +1 oxidation state become more stable than +3 for Ga? Or is it the other way around?

4. Indium (In): Similar to Ga, perhaps. Indium can exhibit +3, but sometimes +1. I think in some compounds, especially with more electronegative elements, In prefers +3, but maybe in certain conditions, +1 is more stable.

5. Thallium (Tl): Thallium is interesting. It's in group 13, but it's a heavier element. I remember that Thallium can have +1 and +3 oxidation states. Now, which one is more stable? I think in Thallium's case, the +1 oxidation state is more common and stable, especially in ThI compounds. Thallium(I) compounds are more stable than Th(III) ones because the +1 state allows for a more favorable electron configuration. Thallium has a filled d-subshell in the +1 state, which is more stable.

Wait, let me think about the general trend in group 13. As you move down the group, the ability to exhibit lower oxidation states (like +1) increases. So the heavier the element, the more stable the +1 state becomes compared to +3.

So for Boron (top of group 13), +3 is more stable. For Aluminum, +3 is common, but maybe +1 is less stable. For Gallium, Indium, and Thallium, +1 becomes more stable.

Looking at the options, the possible answers are A (Al), B (Tl), D (B), H (Ga), I (In). The question is which element has +1 more stable than +3.

Thallium is known for having a more stable +1 oxidation state. For example, ThI compounds are more common and stable than ThIII ones. So the correct answer would be option B: Tl.

Wait, but let me double-check. Gallium can form GaI3, which is a compound where Ga is +3. Indium can form InCl3, also +3. But Thallium(I) compounds, like TlCl, are more stable than Thallium(III) ones. So yes, the answer should be Tl, which is option B.

The question asks which group 13 element has a more stable +1 oxidation state than its +3 oxidation state. Group 13 elements include Boron (B), Aluminum (Al), Gallium (Ga), Indium (In), and Thallium (Tl). Among these, Thallium (Tl) is known for having a more stable +1 oxidation state compared to its +3 state. This is due to the filled d-subshell in the +1 state, which provides greater stability. Therefore, the correct answer is:

B
