Okay, so I have this question about dwarf planets and which one is closest to the Sun. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my astronomy, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that dwarf planets are smaller than the major planets and orbit the Sun. Some of them are in the asteroid belt, while others are in the outer solar system, like in the Kuiper Belt. The main ones I know are Pluto, Eris, Ceres, Haumea, Makemake, and maybe some others like Varuna or Orcus.

Wait, the question is asking which is closest to the Sun. So, I should think about their orbits. Ceres is in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. That's pretty close to the Sun compared to the outer dwarf planets. Then there's Pluto, which is way out there, part of the Kuiper Belt. Eris is even farther, I think, beyond Pluto.

So, if Ceres is in the asteroid belt, it must be closer than the others. Let me try to remember the order. The planets are Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, then the asteroid belt, then Jupiter and Saturn, and beyond that, the outer planets like Uranus, Neptune, and then the Kuiper Belt where Pluto and Eris are.

So, the distance from the Sun would be:

- Ceres is in the asteroid belt, so closer than Mars, which is about 140 million miles away. Ceres' average distance is around 257 million miles, I think. Wait, no, that's farther than Mars. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, no, Mars is about 141 million miles average, and Ceres is in the asteroid belt, which is between Mars and Jupiter. Jupiter is about 484 million miles away. So Ceres would be somewhere between, say, 250-300 million miles on average. So that's farther than Mars but closer than the outer dwarf planets.

But wait, the options include Eris, Pluto, Haumea, etc. So the closest dwarf planet to the Sun would be the one in the asteroid belt, which is Ceres. Because the other dwarf planets are either in the outer solar system or beyond Pluto.

So looking at the options, G is Ceres. So the answer should be G.

The dwarf planet closest to the Sun is Ceres, located in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. 

Answer: G
