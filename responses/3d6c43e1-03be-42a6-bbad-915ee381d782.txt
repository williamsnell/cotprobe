Question:

A 25-year-old man comes to the emergency department because he developed chest pain and shortness of breath 1 hour ago, shortly after snorting cocaine for the first time. He rates the chest pain as a 7 on a 10-point scale and notes that the pain is radiating down his left arm. Medical history is unremarkable and the patient takes no medications or any other illicit drugs. He is 178 cm (5 ft 10 in) tall and weighs 70 kg (154 lb); BMI is 22 kg/m2 . The patient is diaphoretic. Vital signs are temperature 37.5°C (99.5°F), pulse 110/min, respirations 16/min, and blood pressure 200/100 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 95%. Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation. Lungs are clear to auscultation and percussion. Auscultation of the heart discloses an audible S1 and S2. There is no edema, cyanosis, or clubbing of the digits. The patient is fully oriented. He is treated with supplemental oxygen, a 325-mg aspirin tablet, and intravenous nitroglycerin and lorazepam. Despite therapy, he continues to have chest pain and shortness of breath. ECG shows sinus tachycardia with no ST-segment or T-wave abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate additional pharmacotherapy to initiate at this time?

Options:

A: Nitroprusside
B: Verapamil
C: Alteplase
D: Furosemide
E: Phentolamine
F: Atorvastatin
G: Carvedilol
H: Metoprolol
I: Lisinopril
J: Warfarin

Okay, so I have this medical question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's read through the scenario carefully.

The patient is a 25-year-old man who came to the emergency department with chest pain and shortness of breath after snorting cocaine for the first time an hour ago. He rates the chest pain as a 7/10, which is pretty significant. The pain is radiating down his left arm. His medical history is unremarkable, and he doesn't take any medications or other illicit drugs. His vital signs are notable for a high blood pressure of 200/100 mmHg, pulse 110, and a slightly elevated temperature of 37.5°C. He's diaphoretic, meaning he's sweating, which can be a sign of anxiety or pain. Oxygen saturation is 95% on room air, which is okay.

His physical exam shows clear lungs, normal heart sounds with S1 and S2, no edema, cyanosis, or clubbing. He's oriented and fully alert. He was treated with supplemental oxygen, aspirin, IV nitroglycerin, and lorazepam. Despite that, he's still having chest pain and shortness of breath. The ECG shows sinus tachycardia but no ST-segment or T-wave changes, which usually would indicate a STEMI or unstable angina. So, no signs of a heart attack on the ECG.

Now, the question is about the next pharmacotherapy step. Let's look at the options provided: A through J, including things like nitroprusside, verapamil, alteplase, furosemide, phentolamine, atorvastatin, carvedilol, metoprolol, lisinopril, and warfarin.

First, I need to think about the possible conditions this patient could have. Cocaine use is a known trigger for several cardiac issues. The most common is cocaine-induced coronary artery spasm, leading to angina or even a heart attack. But in this case, the ECG doesn't show the typical changes of a STEMI, so it's more likely unstable angina or maybe a stress-induced cardiomyopathy, but that's less likely in a young person without risk factors.

The initial treatment given includes nitroglycerin, which is standard for angina. But the pain isn't resolving, so we need another approach. Let's think about the options.

Option A: Nitroprusside. That's a vasodilator, used in hypertensive emergencies. The patient's blood pressure is high, 200/100, which is dangerous. Nitroprusside can rapidly lower BP, but is it the next step here? Well, he's already on IV nitroglycerin, which also lowers BP. But the chest pain isn't controlled, so maybe blood pressure control isn't the only issue.

Option B: Verapamil. That's a calcium channel blocker, used for angina and hypertension. It can help with coronary artery vasospasm. Since the patient is young and using cocaine, which causes vasoconstriction, verapamil might help relax the coronary arteries. It's often used in Prinzmetal angina.

Option C: Alteplase. That's a thrombolytic used for heart attacks, especially STEMI. But since the ECG doesn't show ST changes, it's not indicated here. Plus, after an hour, if it were a STEMI, it might be too late for alteplase.

Option D: Furosemide. That's a diuretic, used for fluid overload or high blood pressure. The patient doesn't have any signs of heart failure or edema, so this might not be the right choice.

Option E: Phentolamine. That's an alpha-adrenergic blocker, used sometimes for pheochromocytoma or severe hypertension. It's not commonly used in acute angina.

Option F: Atorvastatin. That's a statin, used for cholesterol lowering. It's not an acute treatment for angina; it's more for long-term risk reduction.

Option G: Carvedilol. That's a beta-blocker with some alpha-blockade. It's used for hypertension and heart failure, but beta-blockers can sometimes precipitate angina in unstable situations because they reduce heart rate and can increase oxygen demand if not properly titrated. Also, in acute settings, especially with high BP, beta-blockers are used but need cautious administration.

Option H: Metoprolol. Another beta-blocker, similar to carvedilol. Again, cautious use in acute angina because of potential to increase ischemia if not enough vasodilators are given.

Option I: Lisinopril. An ACE inhibitor, used for hypertension and heart failure. Not an acute treatment for angina.

Option J: Warfarin. An anticoagulant, used for blood thinning. Not relevant here unless there's a clotting issue, which isn't indicated.

So, considering all these, the patient has chest pain that's not resolving. He's on nitroglycerin and oxygen, which didn't help. He's young and likely experiencing cocaine-induced coronary vasospasm. Verapamil is a calcium channel blocker that can relieve coronary artery spasm, so it's a good option here. Alternatively, if beta-blockers are considered, they need to be used with caution because they can sometimes worsen angina if not enough vasodilators are present.

Wait, but the patient's blood pressure is 200/100. Nitroglycerin lowers BP, but if he's not responding, maybe adding a calcium channel blocker would help both the chest pain and possibly lower BP. However, verapamil can cause hypotension, so it's a balance.

Another thought: in cocaine-induced chest pain, if the ECG isn't showing STEMI, it's often unstable angina or a spasm. So, treating with a calcium channel blocker like verapamil would make sense. Alternatively, if the patient is tachycardic, maybe a beta-blocker could help, but beta-blockers can sometimes cause more ischemia if the heart rate is too low, so they're used with caution.

Wait, but the ECG shows sinus tachycardia, which is expected due to pain and possible hypertension. Nitroglycerin might lower BP, but if the chest pain persists, adding verapamil could help with the spasm.

So, the most appropriate next step would be to give verapamil.

The patient is a 25-year-old man presenting with chest pain and shortness of breath after snorting cocaine, likely experiencing cocaine-induced coronary artery spasm. Initial treatment with nitroglycerin, oxygen, and lorazepam hasn't resolved the symptoms. The ECG shows sinus tachycardia without ST-segment changes, ruling out a STEMI. Among the options, verapamil is the most appropriate next step as it is a calcium channel blocker effective for relieving coronary artery spasm, which is a common cause of cocaine-related chest pain. Other options like beta-blockers or diuretics are less suitable in this acute setting.
