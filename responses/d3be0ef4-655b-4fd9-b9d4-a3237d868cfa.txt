Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to solve it. Let me read it again carefully. John Backus will pay the Third National Bank $342.65 on July 1. They want to find out how much he borrowed, given that the interest is $17.25. The options are from A to J, with various amounts. 

Hmm, so the total amount he's paying back is $342.65, and the interest part of that is $17.25. I think this is a simple interest problem, right? So the total amount paid should be the principal plus the interest. 

Wait, let me make sure. Simple interest is usually calculated as Principal × Rate × Time. But in this case, they've given the total interest as $17.25, so maybe I don't need to calculate the interest from scratch. 

So if the total amount paid is $342.65, and the interest is $17.25, then the principal should be the total minus the interest. That makes sense because the interest is the extra amount on top of the principal. 

Let me write that down: Principal = Total Amount - Interest. So plugging in the numbers, that would be $342.65 minus $17.25. Let me do the subtraction. 

342.65 minus 17.25. Let me line them up:
- 342.65
- -17.25
-----------
Subtracting the cents first: 65 - 25 = 40 cents.
Then the dollars: 342 - 17 = 325. So that would be $325.40? Wait, no, wait. Wait, 342 - 17 is 325. So 342.65 minus 17.25 is 325.40. 

Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see $325.40. Let me check the options again. Option J is $325.40. So that's one of the choices. 

But wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Is the total amount including interest, or is $342.65 the amount including principal and interest? I think it's the latter. So the principal is the amount borrowed, and the interest is the extra. So yes, subtracting the interest from the total gives the principal. 

Wait, but let me think again. If I borrowed P, and I have to pay back P plus interest I, then P = Total - I. So P = 342.65 -17.25 = 325.40. So that's option J. 

Wait, but let me check the options again. The options are A: $315.40, B: $359.90, C: $340.00, D: $300.00, E: $17.25, F: $342.65, G: $365.40, H: $360.15, I: $330.50, J: $325.40. 

Yes, J is $325.40, which is what I calculated. So that should be the correct answer. 

Wait, but maybe I'm missing something. Could the interest be calculated on the principal for a certain period, and I'm supposed to find the principal using the simple interest formula? But the problem states that the interest is $17.25, so perhaps it's a straightforward subtraction. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to consider if the interest is simple or compound, but since the problem doesn't specify the time or the rate, I think the simplest approach is to subtract the interest from the total amount to get the principal. 

So I think the correct answer is J: $325.40.
</think>

The total amount John pays is $342.65, which includes the principal and interest. Given the interest is $17.25, subtracting this from the total gives the principal: $342.65 - $17.25 = $325.40. 

Answer: J
