Okay, so I've got this problem here about a linear function f with a nonzero slope. The question is asking which statement must be FALSE when c is less than d. Let me break this down step by step because I want to make sure I understand it correctly.

First, I remember that a linear function has the form f(x) = mx + b, where m is the slope. Since the slope is nonzero, that means the function is either increasing or decreasing. If the slope is positive, the function increases as x increases. If it's negative, the function decreases as x increases.

Now, the problem states that c < d. So, c is to the left of d on the x-axis. Depending on the slope, f(d) could be greater than or less than f(c).

Let me look at each option one by one to see which must be false.

Option A: f(d) > f(c). If the slope is positive, then since d > c, f(d) would indeed be greater than f(c). So this could be true. But if the slope is negative, f(d) would be less than f(c), making this statement false. But the question is asking which must be false, so I can't conclude yet. I'll keep this in mind.

Option B: f(c) < f(d). This is the opposite of option A. If the slope is positive, f(c) < f(d) is true. If the slope is negative, then f(c) would actually be greater than f(d), making this statement false. So depending on the slope, this could be either true or false. So it's not necessarily always false.

Option C: f(d) ≠ f(c). Since the function is linear with a nonzero slope, it's either always increasing or always decreasing. That means if c ≠ d, their outputs must be different. So f(d) can't be equal to f(c) because the slope isn't zero. Therefore, this statement must always be true. So this can't be the false one.

Option D: f(c) = f(d). From what I just thought about option C, this must be false because the function is linear with a nonzero slope, so c < d implies f(c) ≠ f(d). So this would always be false, making it a candidate. But let me check the other options to be sure.

Option E: f(d) < f(c). If the slope is negative, since d > c, f(d) would be less than f(c). So this would be true. If the slope is positive, this would be false. So it depends on the slope, so it's not necessarily always false.

Option F: f(c) ≠ f(d). Wait, this is the same as option C. So again, since the slope is nonzero, f(c) can't equal f(d) when c < d. So this must be true, so it's not the false one.

Option G: f(c) > f(d). This is the opposite of option E. If the slope is positive, then since c < d, f(c) < f(d), so this would be false. If the slope is negative, then f(c) would be greater than f(d), making this statement true. So again, it's not always false.

Wait, let me recap. The question is asking which must be FALSE. So which option is always false, regardless of the slope's sign.

Looking at the options, option D says f(c) = f(d). Since the function is linear with a nonzero slope, for c < d, f(c) will never equal f(d). So option D must always be false.

Also, looking back at option C, it's always true. So the answer should be D.

The correct answer is D because, for a linear function with a nonzero slope, f(c) cannot equal f(d) when c < d.

Answer: D
