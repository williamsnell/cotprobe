Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how many out-of-town friends Morgan has on the social networking site. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, I know that Morgan has 60 female friends and 50 male friends. So, the total number of friends she has is 60 + 50, which equals 110 friends in total. But wait, the question isn't asking for the total friends; it's asking specifically about out-of-town friends. So I need to focus on that part.

The problem states that 30% of her female friends live in town, and 40% of her male friends live in town. That means we can calculate the number of female friends in town and the number of male friends in town separately, then add them together to find the total number of in-town friends. The remaining friends would be out-of-town.

Let's start with the female friends. She has 60 female friends, and 30% of them are in town. So, I'll calculate 30% of 60. To do that, I can multiply 60 by 0.3. 

60 * 0.3 = 18. So, 18 female friends live in town.

Next, for the male friends, she has 50, and 40% live in town. So I'll calculate 40% of 50. That's 50 multiplied by 0.4.

50 * 0.4 = 20. So, 20 male friends live in town.

Now, adding the in-town friends together: 18 female + 20 male = 38 in-town friends.

But wait, the question asks for out-of-town friends. So I need to subtract the in-town friends from the total number of friends to find the out-of-town ones. The total friends are 110.

So, 110 total friends - 38 in-town friends = 72 out-of-town friends.

Looking at the options provided, option B is 72. So that should be the correct answer.

Morgan has 60 female friends and 50 male friends, totaling 110 friends. 30% of the female friends (18) and 40% of the male friends (20) live in town, summing to 38 in-town friends. Subtracting this from the total gives 72 out-of-town friends. 

Answer: B
