Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an object viewed through a glass plate, and I need to find the thickness of the glass. Hmm, let me try to remember what I learned about optics and refraction.

Alright, the problem says that when an object is viewed normally (which I think means directly, without any angle) through a plate of glass with a refractive index of 1.5, it appears to be five-sixths of an inch nearer than it really is. So the apparent shift is 5/6 inches. The question is asking for the thickness of the glass.

Wait, I remember that when light passes through a transparent medium like glass, it bends at the interfaces, and this causes the object to appear displaced. There's a formula for the lateral shift, right? Let me try to recall.

I think the formula for the lateral displacement (or shift) when light goes through a slab of glass is something like d = (n-1) * t, where n is the refractive index and t is the thickness of the glass. But wait, I'm not entirely sure if that's correct. Let me think again.

Oh, right! The formula for the lateral shift when light enters perpendicular to a thin slab is indeed d = (n-1) * t, where t is the thickness. So, if the object appears shifted closer by 5/6 inches, that must be the displacement d.

Wait, but let me make sure. When you look at an object through a glass plate, the light bends at the top and bottom surfaces, causing the object to seem displaced. The shift depends on the thickness of the glass and its refractive index. So yes, the formula should be d = (n - 1) * t.

Given that, n is 1.5 here, and d is 5/6 inches. So I can plug these into the formula to find t.

Let me write that out:

d = (n - 1) * t

So,

t = d / (n - 1)

Substituting the values:

d = 5/6 inches

n = 1.5, so n-1 = 0.5.

So,

t = (5/6) / 0.5

Wait, 0.5 is the same as 1/2. So dividing by 0.5 is the same as multiplying by 2.

So,

t = (5/6) * 2 = (5*2)/6 = 10/6 = 5/3 ≈ 1.666... inches.

Hmm, looking at the options, let's see:

A: 1.0
B: 1.75
C:3.0
D:0.5
E:4.0
F:2.5
G:1.5
H:3.5
I:2.0
J:2.75

Wait, 5/3 is approximately 1.666, which is between 1.5 and 1.75. But none of the options exactly match that. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, maybe I got the formula wrong. Let me double-check the formula for lateral shift. Another thought: perhaps the shift formula is different. Oh! Wait, I think the formula might actually be d = (2 * (n-1) * t) / (n + 1) when the light is passing through a slab and the object is viewed normally. No, wait, that's for when the light is entering from one medium into another, but in this case, it's a glass slab with plane parallel faces, so maybe it's a different formula.

Wait, no, I think the correct formula for lateral displacement when light passes through a thin slab perpendicularly is d = (n-1) * t. Because the light goes straight through without changing direction, but the phase shift causes the apparent displacement. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me think again. When you have a glass slab, the light entering and exiting causes a shift. The formula I remember is d = (2 * t * (n-1)) / (n + 1). No, wait, that's when the light is at an angle, but in this case, it's normal incidence, so maybe the formula simplifies.

Wait, I'm not confident. Let me search my memory. Oh, wait, another approach: when you look at an object through a glass plate, the apparent depth is less than the real depth. The formula for the apparent depth is given by (real depth) / n.

Wait, no, that's when light is passing through a medium of different refractive index, like water, causing objects to appear closer. Wait, that's similar to the concept here.

Wait, the apparent depth formula is indeed (real depth) / n. So if the real depth is t (the thickness of the glass), the apparent depth would be t / n. So the displacement would be the real depth minus the apparent depth, which is t - t/n = t(1 - 1/n).

So the displacement d is t(1 - 1/n) = t ( (n-1)/n ).

Wait, but in the problem, the displacement is 5/6 inches. So:

d = t ( (n -1) ) / n

Because n = 1.5,

d = t (0.5) / 1.5 = t (1/3)

So,

t = d * 3

Because d = (n-1)/(n) * t → t = d * n / (n-1)

Wait, let me go through that again.

Wait, the formula I'm getting confused about is whether the displacement is d = t(n-1) or d = t(1 - 1/n). Let me clarify.

When light passes through a glass slab normally, the apparent shift (d) can be calculated as d = t (1 - 1/n). So,

d = t ( (n - 1)/n )

So, rearranged,

t = d * n / (n-1)

Given that, with n=1.5 and d=5/6 inches,

t = (5/6) * 1.5 / (0.5)

Because 1.5 is 3/2, and 0.5 is 1/2.

So,

t = (5/6) * (3/2) / (1/2)

Wait, (3/2) divided by (1/2) is (3/2) * (2/1) )= 3.

So,

t = (5/6) * 3 = (5 *3)/(6) = 15/6 = 2.5 inches.

Wait, that's 2.5 inches, which is option F.

So the thickness is 2.5 inches. Let me check the options again.

Options:

F: 2.5 inches.

Yes, that's there.

Wait, so did I get it right? Let me double-check the steps.

1. The displacement d is given as 5/6 inches.

2. The formula used is d = t (n-1)/n.

3. Rearranged, t = d * n / (n-1).

4. Substituting:

d=5/6, n=1.5=3/2, n-1=0.5=1/2.

So,

t = (5/6) * (3/2) / (1/2)

The denominator is (1/2), so dividing by (1/2) is multiplying by 2.

So,

t = (5/6) * (3/2) * 2.

The 2 in the numerator and denominator cancels, so:

t = (5/6) * 3 = 15/6 = 2.5 inches.

Yes, that makes sense. So the correct answer is F: 2.5 inches.
</think>

The problem involves finding the thickness of a glass plate (n = 1.5) where an object appears to be five-sixths of an inch (5/6) nearer than it actually is. The formula for the lateral displacement (d) when light passes through a glass slab normally is:

\[
d = t \cdot \frac{n - 1}{n}
\]

Where:
- \(d = \frac{5}{6}\) inches (displacement),
- \(n = 1.5\) (refractive index of glass),
- \(t\) is the thickness of the glass.

Rearranging the formula to solve for \(t\):

\[
t = \frac{d \cdot n}{n - 1}
\]

Substituting the given values:

\[
t = \frac{\left(\frac{5}{6}\right) \cdot 1.5}{1.5 - 1} = \frac{\left(\frac{5}{6}\right) \cdot \frac{3}{2}}{0.5}
\]

Simplifying:

\[
t = \frac{5}{6} \cdot \frac{3}{2} \cdot 2 = \frac{15}{6} = 2.5 \text{ inches}
\]

Thus, the thickness of the glass is **2.5 inches**, which corresponds to option F.
