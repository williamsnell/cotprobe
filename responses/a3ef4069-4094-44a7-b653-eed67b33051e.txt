Alright, so I've got this multiple-choice question here, and I need to figure out which of the listed companies isn't an online stock brokerage. The options are A through G, and each is a company name. Let me go through each one step by step.

First, I'll list out the options again to make sure I have them all:

A: DLJ Direct
B: Ameritrade
C: E*Trade
D: Charles Schwab
E: Fidelity Investments
F: Datek Online
G: EDigital

I know that online stock brokerages are companies that allow people to buy and sell stocks over the internet. So I'm looking for the one that doesn't fit into that category.

Starting with option B: Ameritrade. I remember hearing that Ameritrade is a well-known online brokerage. I think they were one of the early players in the online trading space, so that's definitely an online broker. So B is likely not the answer.

Option C: E*Trade. That's another one I've heard of. E*Trade is a big name in online trading, offering services for buying and selling stocks, options, and more. So C is also an online broker, not the answer.

Option D: Charles Schwab. I'm pretty sure Schwab is a major brokerage. They offer online trading through their website, and I think they were one of the first to offer no-commission trades for certain types of transactions. So D is an online broker as well.

Option E: Fidelity Investments. Fidelity is a huge financial services company. They do offer online brokerage services, but I think they also have a broader range of services like investment management and retirement accounts. However, they are still an online stock broker, so E isn't the answer.

Option F: Datek Online. I'm a bit less familiar with this one, but I think Datek was an online brokerage. I recall it being around in the early days of online trading, maybe even before some of the others. So F is probably an online broker.

Option G: EDigital. Hmm, I'm not as sure about this one. EDigital doesn't ring a bell as strongly as the others. Let me think if I've heard of EDigital in the context of online stock trading. I'm trying to remember if they offer brokerage services. I might be confusing them with something else, perhaps a tech company or a digital services provider. Alternatively, maybe EDigital is a newer or less well-known brokerage, but I'm not certain. 

Wait, another thought: sometimes companies have similar-sounding names. EDigital could be a fintech company offering other services, not necessarily stock brokerage. Alternatively, maybe they're a smaller or regional broker. I'm not entirely sure, but I'm leaning towards EDigital not being a stock brokerage.

Now, looking back at option A: DLJ Direct. DLJ was a Wall Street firm, but I think DLJ Direct was their online brokerage arm. So A is an online broker.

So, putting it all together, the options that are definitely online brokers are B, C, D, E, F, and A. That leaves G: EDigital as the possible outlier. I'm not certain, but I think EDigital isn't an online stock brokerage. Therefore, the answer should be G.

The answer is G: EDigital.
