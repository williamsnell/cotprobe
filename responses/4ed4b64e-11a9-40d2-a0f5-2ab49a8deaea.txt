Okay, so I have this math problem here, and I need to find the number that makes the statement 2 over 9 equal to 14 over something true. The options are given from A to J, and I have to choose the correct one. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that when two fractions are equal, they form a proportion. So, 2/9 = 14/? means that 2 divided by 9 is the same as 14 divided by the unknown number, which I'll call x for now. So, the equation is 2/9 = 14/x.

I think the way to solve for x here is by cross-multiplying. That means I'll multiply the numerator of the first fraction by the denominator of the second fraction and set it equal to the denominator of the first fraction multiplied by the numerator of the second fraction. So, that would be 2 * x = 9 * 14.

Let me write that down to make it clearer: 2x = 126. Wait, because 9 times 14 is 126, right? 9*10 is 90, and 9*4 is 36, so 90+36 is 126.

Now, I need to solve for x. Since 2x equals 126, I can divide both sides by 2 to get x by itself. So, x = 126 / 2. Let me do that division: 126 divided by 2 is 63. So, x is 63.

Looking back at the options, 63 is option G. So, I think the correct answer is G.

Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. If I plug 63 back into the original statement, does 2/9 equal 14/63? Let's see. 14 divided by 63 simplifies to 2/9 because both 14 and 63 can be divided by 7. 14 divided by 7 is 2, and 63 divided by 7 is 9. So, yes, 14/63 reduces to 2/9. That checks out.

I don't think I made any mistakes here. Cross-multiplying seems like the right approach, and the calculations seem correct. So, yeah, the answer should be G: 63.

The correct answer is found by solving the proportion 2/9 = 14/x. Cross-multiplying gives 2x = 126, so x = 63. The answer is G.

Answer: G
