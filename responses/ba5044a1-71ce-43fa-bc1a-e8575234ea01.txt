Okay, so I've got this question about Tolstoy, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. The question is asking, "Before his conversion, what was Tolstoy surrounded by?" with options from A to J. I'm a bit rusty on my Tolstoy, but I'll try to piece this together.

First, I remember that Leo Tolstoy was a Russian writer, famous for works like "War and Peace" and "Anna Karenina." I think he came from a wealthy background, being part of the aristocracy. So maybe his early life was pretty comfortable. But then, later in life, he went through a significant change, a conversion, which I believe was a spiritual or philosophical shift.

The question is about before his conversion. So, what was his environment like before that transformation? Options include things like wealth, pressure from society, literature, etc.

Looking at the options:

A: things that no one would want – Doesn't make sense. He was part of the upper class, so he had nice things.

B: deep insight – Maybe, but that seems more abstract.

C: poverty and hardship – Unlikely. He was born into a noble family with estates.

D: pressures of aristocratic society – That sounds plausible. Aristocrats had certain expectations and social obligations.

E: utter despair – I don't recall that being the case before his conversion.

F: abundance of wealth and power – This seems likely since he was part of the aristocracy.

G: complete happiness – Probably not, as his works often dealt with human struggles.

H: heavenly bliss – That's more of a religious state, which came after his conversion.

I: world of literature and art – He was immersed in that, but the question is about what surrounded him before his conversion.

J: turmoil of war – He did serve in the military and wrote about war, but the question is about his surroundings before conversion.

So, before his conversion, Tolstoy was likely living a life of privilege. He inherited a large estate, had wealth, and was part of the aristocratic society. Therefore, he was surrounded by the trappings of wealth and power. That would point to option F.

Wait, but another angle: he was part of the upper class, which came with social pressures. So option D could also be a contender. But the question is about what he was surrounded by, more about his environment than the pressures he felt. So F seems more accurate because it's about the abundance he had.

Yes, I think F is the right answer because before his conversion, Tolstoy was living a life of wealth and power as a member of the aristocracy.

The answer is F: an abundance of wealth and power.
