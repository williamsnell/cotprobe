Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about Berkeley's philosophy. The question is asking what Berkeley asserts about existing and perceiving. The options are A through J, and I need to pick the right one.

First, I remember that George Berkeley was a philosopher who talked a lot about perception and existence. He's known for his empiricist views, right? I think he had something to do with the idea that things only exist if we perceive them. Wait, wasn't he the one who said "esse est percipi," which means "to be is to be perceived"? That sounds familiar.

So, if that's the case, then existing and perceiving must be connected in some way. Let me look at the options again. Option D says they are one and the same thing. That seems to align with what I remember because Berkeley's statement suggests that existence is tied directly to perception. So, if something isn't perceived, does it exist? According to him, probably not.

Option E says they are two distinct things. But if existence depends on perception, then they can't be entirely separate. So E might not be correct. Option B is interdependent, which means they depend on each other. That's possible, but I think Berkeley goes further to say they're the same, not just dependent on each other. 

Option J suggests both are illusions. I don't think that's right because Berkeley does believe in the reality of things as we perceive them, even if he's critical of materialism. So J is probably not the answer.

Looking back, D seems to fit best. Berkeley's view implies that existing and perceiving are the same thing because existence is a form of perception. So I'll go with D.

The correct answer is D: one and the same thing. Berkeley's philosophy, particularly his assertion that "esse est percipi," indicates that existence and perception are not separate but rather unified.

Answer: D
