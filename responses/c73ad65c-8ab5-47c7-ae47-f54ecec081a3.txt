Okay, so I have this question about a model of social support, and I need to figure out which term it's referring to. The question says that the model suggests that people who are close to you now will likely stay close for the rest of your life. The options are A through J.

Hmm, let me think about each term. I'm trying to remember what each model in social support is called. I've heard a bit about different theories in psychology, especially regarding relationships and social networks.

Stability (A) sounds like it might refer to something consistent over time, but I'm not sure if that's the exact term. Consistency (C) is similar, but again, not exactly ringing a bell for this specific model.

Train (B) doesn't seem right. Maybe it's a typo? I haven't heard of a "train model" in this context. Attachment (D) is a term I know from attachment theory, which is about early relationships and how they influence behavior, but I'm not sure if that's the same as this model.

Continuity (E) might be related, but I'm not certain. Convoy (F) sounds familiar. I think I've heard the term " convoy model" before. Let me try to recall. I think the convoy model refers to the idea that the people you're close to when you're young will stay with you throughout your life, like a convoy of ships traveling together. That seems to fit the question.

Constant (G) is about being unchanging, but again, not the model I'm thinking of. Companionship (H) and Companion (I) seem more like general terms for relationships rather than a specific model. Cohort (J) refers to a group of people who share a common characteristic, like age, but that doesn't directly answer the question about closeness over time.

So putting it together, the model that says close relationships will remain close is the convoy model. Therefore, the answer should be F.

The model that suggests close relationships will remain close over time is the convoy model.
