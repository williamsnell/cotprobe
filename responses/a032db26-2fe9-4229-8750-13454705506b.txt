Okay, so I have this problem here about heating water, and I need to figure out how many kilocalories are needed to bring it from 32°F to the boiling point at 212°F. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.

First, I remember that the formula for calculating the heat required to change the temperature of a substance is Q = m * c * ΔT, where Q is the heat in kilocalories, m is mass in grams, c is the specific heat capacity, and ΔT is the change in temperature in degrees Celsius.

Wait, but the temperature is given in Fahrenheit. Oh right, I need to convert that to Celsius because the specific heat of water is usually given in Celsius. So, the initial temperature is 32°F, which I know is 0°C because that's the freezing point of water. The boiling point is 212°F, which is 100°C. So the temperature change ΔT is 100°C - 0°C = 100°C. That part's straightforward.

Next, I need to find the mass of the water. The container's dimensions are given as 2.5 m × 50 cm × 60 mm. Oh, wait, I should convert all these to the same unit. Let's go with meters since the final answer is in kilocalories and I think the density will be in kg/m³ or something like that.

So, 2.5 m is already in meters. 50 cm is 0.5 meters, and 60 mm is 0.06 meters. Now, the volume V is length × width × height, so V = 2.5 m * 0.5 m * 0.06 m. Let me calculate that: 2.5 * 0.5 is 1.25, multiplied by 0.06 is 0.075 m³. So the volume is 0.075 cubic meters.

I know that 1 m³ of water weighs 1000 kg, so the mass m is 0.075 m³ * 1000 kg/m³ = 75 kg. So m = 75 kg. Hmm, wait, but the specific heat capacity c is usually given in calories per gram or per kilogram. I think the specific heat of water is about 1 calorie per gram per degree Celsius, but I should check the units.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The specific heat capacity of water is 4.184 J/(g°C), but since we're using kilocalories, which are also known as Calories (with a capital C), I should remember that 1 kcal = 4184 J. Alternatively, 1 cal = 4.184 J. So, the specific heat capacity in terms of kilocalories might be easier.

Wait, another approach: since 1 kcal = 4184 J, and knowing that the specific heat (c) of water is 1 cal/(g°C), which is 4.184 J/(g°C), but I'm getting confused. Let me try to approach it differently.

Alternatively, I can calculate the heat in joules first and then convert to kilocalories. So, using Q = m * c * ΔT.

Mass m is 75 kg, which is 75,000 grams. Specific heat c for water is 4.184 J/(g°C). ΔT is 100°C.

So, Q in joules would be 75,000 g * 4.184 J/(g°C) * 100°C. Let me compute that:

75,000 * 4.184 = let's see, 75,000 * 4 = 300,000; 75,000 * 0.184 = approx 13,800. So total is 313,800 J per degree? No, wait, wait. Wait, 75,000 * 4.184 = ?

Wait, let me calculate it accurately. 75,000 * 4 = 300,000. 75,000 * 0.184 = 75,000 * 0.1 is 7,500; 75,000 * 0.08 is 6,000; 75,000 * 0.004 is 300. So 7,500 +6,000 =13,500 +300=13,800. So total 300,000 +13,800=313,800 J per degree. Wait, no, no, ΔT is 100°C, so total Q is 313,800 J/°C * 100°C = 31,380,000 J.

Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. 75,000 grams is 75 kg. Oh, wait, but 1 kg is 1000 g, so 75 kg is 75,000 g. So 75,000 *4.184 J/(g°C) *100. Let me compute 75,000 *4.184 first.

Let me compute 75,000 *4 =300,000; 75,000 *0.184=13,800, as before. So 300,000 +13,800 =313,800 J/(°C). Then multiplied by 100°C gives 31,380,000 J. Now, converting J to kilocalories: since 1 kcal =4184 J, so Q =31,380,000 J /4184 J/kcal.

Let me compute that: 31,380,000 /4184 ≈ ?

Well, 4184 * 7000 = 29,288,000. Because 4184 *7000 = 4184 *7 *1000=29,288 *1000=29,288,000.

Subtract that from 31,380,000: 31,380,000-29,288,000=2,092,000.

Now, 4184 * 500=2,092,000. So total is 7000 +500=7500 kcal. Wait, that can't be right. Because 7500 kcal is 7.5e3 kcal, which is option C.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check the calculations. Because 75 kg of water is a lot. Let me see: 75 kg is 75,000 grams, correct. Specific heat is 4.184 J/g°C, so 75,000 *4.184=313,800 J per degree. Multiply by 100: 31,380,000 J. Divided by 4184 J/kcal: 31,380,000 /4184 ≈7500 kcal.

So the answer would be 7.5 ×10³ kcal, which is option C.

Wait, but let me think again. Oh wait, another approach: perhaps using the specific heat in kcal units. Since 1 cal=4.184 J, then 1 kcal=4184 J, which is 1000 cal. So the specific heat of water is 1 cal/(g°C), which is 0.001 kcal/(g°C). But let me see:

Alternatively, maybe I should have used the specific heat capacity in kcal per kg per °C. Let me think: 1 cal = 4.184 J, so 1 kcal = 4184 J. So 1 cal/(g°C) is equivalent to 4.184 J/(g°C). Wait, perhaps another way. Let me compute specific heat in kcal/(kg°C).

Since 1 cal =0.001 kcal, then 1 cal/(g°C) = 1 kcal/(kg°C) because 1 cal = 0.001 kcal and 1 g=0.001 kg. So 1 cal/(g°C) = (0.001 kcal) / (0.001 kg * °C) )= 1 kcal/(kg·°C). So specific heat c =1 kcal/(kg·°C).

So, m=75 kg, c=1 kcal/(kg·°C), ΔT=100°C.

So Q =75 kg *1 kcal/(kg·°C) *100°C =75 *100=7500 kcal. So that's 7.5e3 kcal, which is option C.

I think that's correct. So the answer is C.

To determine the number of kilocalories required to heat the water from 32°F to 212°F, we first convert the temperatures to Celsius: 32°F = 0°C and 212°F = 100°C, giving a temperature change ΔT = 100°C. 

Next, we calculate the volume of the container using its dimensions: 2.5 m × 0.5 m × 0.06 m = 0.075 m³. Since 1 m³ of water weighs 1000 kg, the mass of the water is 75 kg.

The specific heat capacity of water is 1 kcal/(kg·°C). Using the formula Q = m * c * ΔT, we find:

Q = 75 kg * 1 kcal/(kg·°C) * 100°C = 7500 kcal.

Thus, the number of kilocalories required is **7.5 × 10³ kcal**, which corresponds to option C.
