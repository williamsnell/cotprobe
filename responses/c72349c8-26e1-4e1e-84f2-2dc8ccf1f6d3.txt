Okay, so I have this physics problem here about simple pendulums. Let me try to think through it step by step. Hmm, the question says there are two pendulums, A and B. Both have the same mass, but their strings have different lengths, L_A and L_B. They're oscillating in the same gravitational field, so g is the same for both. 

The key point is that the period of pendulum B is twice that of pendulum A. I remember that the formula for the period of a simple pendulum is T = 2π√(L/g). Right, so the period depends on the square root of the length divided by gravity. Since g is the same for both, the periods are determined by the square roots of their respective lengths.

So, let's denote the periods as T_A and T_B. The problem states that T_B = 2 * T_A. I can write that as T_B = 2 T_A. 

Using the formula, T_A = 2π√(L_A/g) and T_B = 2π√(L_B/g). Substituting the relationship between T_B and T_A gives me:

2π√(L_B/g) = 2 * [2π√(L_A/g)].

Wait, let me write that again more clearly. Since T_B = 2 T_A,

2π√(L_B/g) = 2 * (2π√(L_A/g)).

Wait, no, that's not right. Let me correct that. The original equation is T_B = 2 T_A. So,

2π√(L_B/g) = 2 * (2π√(L_A/g)).

Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. Because T_A is 2π√(L_A/g), so T_B is 2 T_A. So,

T_B = 2 T_A
=> 2π√(L_B/g) = 2 * (2π√(L_A/g)).

Wait, that can't be right. Let me correct this. No, actually, that's not correct. Because T_A is 2π√(L_A/g), so T_B = 2 * T_A would be:

2π√(L_B/g) = 2 * (2π√(L_A/g)).

Wait, no, that's not right. Let me try again. Let's write it properly.

T_A = 2π√(L_A/g)
T_B = 2 * T_A = 2 * (2π√(L_A/g)).

But T_B is also equal to 2π√(L_B/g). So,

2π√(L_B/g) = 2 * (2π√(L_A/g)).

Wait, that would mean T_B is 2 times T_A, which is correct. Now, let's simplify this equation.

Divide both sides by 2π:

√(L_B/g) = 2 * √(L_A/g).

Because the right-hand side is 2*(T_A) which is 2*(2π√(L_A/g)) divided by 2π gives 2√(L_A/g).

Wait, no. Let me re-express the equation properly.

We have T_B = 2 T_A.

But T_B = 2π√(L_B/g)
T_A = 2π√(L_A/g)

So,

2π√(L_B/g) = 2 * (2π√(L_A/g))

Wait, no, that's not correct. Because T_B is 2 times T_A, so substituting:

2π√(L_B/g) = 2 * (2π√(L_A/g)).

Wait, that's not right. Let me try again.

No, T_B is 2 * T_A, so:

2π√(L_B/g) = 2 * [2π√(L_A/g)].

Wait, that would mean T_B is 2*T_A, but that's correct. Let's then divide both sides by 2π:

√(L_B/g) = 2 * √(L_A/g).

Now, square both sides to eliminate the square roots:

(L_B/g) = (2)^2 * (L_A/g)
=> L_B / g = 4 * (L_A / g)

Multiply both sides by g:

L_B = 4 L_A.

So, the length of pendulum B is four times the length of pendulum A. So, looking at the options, I need to find which option says L_B is 4 times L_A. Scanning the options:

I: L_B = 4 L_A. That's option I.
</think>

The period of a simple pendulum is given by \( T = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{L}{g}} \). For pendulums A and B, with periods \( T_A \) and \( T_B \), we know \( T_B = 2T_A \). Substituting into the formula:

\[
2\pi \sqrt{\frac{L_B}{g}} = 2 \cdot 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{L_A}{g}}
\]

Dividing both sides by \( 2\pi \) and squaring:

\[
\frac{L_B}{g} = 4 \cdot \frac{L_A}{g}
\]

Thus, \( L_B = 4L_A \). The correct option is:

I: \( L_B = 4L_A \).

The answer is I.
