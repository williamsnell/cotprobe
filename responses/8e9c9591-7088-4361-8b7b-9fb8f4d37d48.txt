Okay, so I have this question about hostile aggression, and I need to figure out which option best illustrates it. Let me start by understanding what hostile aggression is. From what I remember, hostile aggression is when someone acts aggressively with the intent to harm another person, often due to anger, frustration, or some other negative emotion. It's different from instrumental aggression, which is more about achieving a goal through aggression, like stealing something by pushing someone out of the way.

The question gives me five options labeled A to D, and I need to pick the one that best fits hostile aggression. Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: An employee sabotages his coworker's project due to jealousy. Sabotage sounds like intentional harm, and jealousy is a strong emotion. So this seems like it could be hostile aggression because the intent is to harm the coworker's work, possibly out of anger or jealousy.

Option B: A waitress breaks several cups and saucers when she drops a tray on the floor. This seems more like an accident. She wasn't intending to harm anyone or anything; she just dropped the tray, which caused the breakage. So this is probably not hostile aggression but rather an accident due to clumsiness or stress.

Option C: A teacher grades a student's paper harshly because they have a personal grudge against the student. Grading harshly could be seen as punitive, but is it hostile? If the teacher is acting out of anger or a grudge, that could count as hostile aggression. However, sometimes harsh grading might be seen as instrumental if the teacher is trying to teach the student a lesson, but in this case, it's because of a personal grudge, so it's more about the emotion.

Option D: A man slaps his wife because he is angry that she made hamburgers for dinner again. Slapping is a physical aggressive act, and the reason given is anger over the meal choice. This seems clearly hostile because the intent is to cause harm due to frustration or anger, which fits the definition.

Option E: A sanitation man knocks over some rose bushes when he throws an empty can to the curb. This sounds like an accidental act, not intentional. He's trying to throw the can and maybe didn't aim well, causing damage. So this isn't hostile aggression.

Option F: A careless driver hits and severely injures a pedestrian who is crossing the street. Careless driving could be considered negligence, but is it hostile? If the driver was intentionally trying to harm someone, it would be hostile, but if it's just careless, it might be more negligent aggression. However, sometimes negligence can be seen as a form of aggression, but I'm not sure if it's classified as hostile or instrumental.

Now, thinking again: Hostile aggression is about intent to harm with negative emotions. So option A is intentional sabotage due to jealousy, which fits. Option D is a slap due to anger, which is definitely hostile. Option C is harsh grading because of a grudge, which also has emotional intent. So which one is the best example?

Sabotage (A) is clearly intended to harm someone's work, possibly their career, which is more severe. The man slapping his wife (D) is physical aggression, which is definitely hostile. Grading harshly (C) might be more about punishment but could still be hostile if the intent is to harm the student's grade out of anger.

Wait, but in option D, the reason is about dinner, which seems trivial, so the slap is likely due to frustration and anger, making it a clear example of hostile aggression. Similarly, option A is also hostile but perhaps more about competition or sabotage at work.

I think both A and D are strong candidates. But the question asks for the best illustration. Hostile aggression often involves direct physical harm or direct intent to cause emotional harm. The slap in D is a direct physical act of aggression due to anger, which is a classic example. Sabotage is more indirect but still fits. However, sometimes sabotage can be seen as instrumental if the goal is to achieve something else, like getting ahead, but here it's due to jealousy, so it's more emotional.

I'm a bit torn between A and D. But I think D is a more straightforward example because it's a direct physical act of aggression. So I'll go with D as the best answer.
