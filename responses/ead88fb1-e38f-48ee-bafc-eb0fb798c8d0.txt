Okay, I need to figure out which statements about the whiffle ball are true. Let's go through each statement one by one.

Statement I says the ball's speed is zero at the highest point. Hmm, when you toss something straight up, it slows down because of gravity. At the very top, it's not moving upward or downward, so the speed should be zero. That makes sense because if it had any speed, it would keep going up or start falling. So I think I is true.

Statement II claims the ball's acceleration is zero at the highest point. Wait, acceleration due to gravity is always acting on the ball, right? Even at the highest point, gravity is pulling it down. So the acceleration can't be zero. Acceleration is about the change in velocity, and since gravity is still acting, the ball is decelerating (slowing down) as it goes up and accelerating as it comes down. So II must be false.

Statement III says it takes longer to go up than to come down. Whiffle balls are light and have lots of air resistance. When going up, the ball not only has to fight against gravity but also the air. This makes it slow down more quickly, taking more time to reach the top. On the way down, air resistance acts in the same direction as gravity, so the ball might accelerate more than it would in a vacuum. Wait, no, actually, in a vacuum, it would take the same time up and down. But with air resistance, going up is slower because of the opposing force, and coming down, it might actually reach terminal velocity. So the time going up is longer than the time coming down. So III is true.

Wait, but in reality, for a whiffle ball, the air resistance is significant. So going up, the ball is decelerated by both gravity and air resistance, which would make it take longer to reach the top. On the way down, the ball is moving faster because gravity is helping, but air resistance is opposing. But does it take longer to fall? Or does the time up and down differ? Let me think. In a vacuum, time up and down would be the same because acceleration is constant. But with air resistance, the ball would slow down more on the way up, meaning it takes longer to reach the peak. On the way down, it starts from zero velocity and accelerates, but perhaps reaches a higher terminal velocity, so maybe it takes less time to come down than up. So yes, the time up is longer than the time down. So III is true.

Wait, but I might be confusing this. Let me think again. Suppose the ball goes up. It's moving against gravity and air resistance, which both oppose the motion. So the deceleration is greater than g. The time to reach the top would be longer because it's slowing down faster. When it comes down, it starts from rest (at the top) and accelerates, but the acceleration is less than g because air resistance is opposite to the motion. Wait, no, when coming down, the acceleration is net (g - air resistance), but since the air resistance is in the same direction as the motion, it actually reduces the net acceleration. So the ball accelerates less than g on the way down. Hmm, but wait, the acceleration on the way up is greater than g, because the net force is mg + air resistance. So on the way up, the deceleration is higher, making it take longer to reach the top. On the way down, the acceleration is less than g because the air resistance is opposite to the direction of motion, so net acceleration is g minus something. So the ball doesn't accelerate as fast on the way down. Therefore, the time taken to go up is longer than the time to come down. So III is correct.

So, the statements I and III are true. Statement II is false.

Looking at the options, option A is I & III only. So the answer should be A.

The ball’s speed is zero at the highest point (I is true). The ball’s acceleration is not zero; gravity acts constantly (II is false). The ball takes longer to rise due to air resistance, making the time up longer than down (III is true). 

Answer: A

The answer is A.
