Okay, so I've got this math problem here. It says, if a equals 7 and b equals 13, what is the number of even positive integers less than ab? The options are from A to J, and I need to choose the correct one.

First, I should probably figure out what ab is. Since a is 7 and b is 13, I can multiply them together to get ab. Let me do that: 7 times 13. Hmm, 7 times 10 is 70, and 7 times 3 is 21, so adding those together gives 91. So ab is 91.

Now, the question is asking for the number of even positive integers less than 91. Wait, even positive integers... So that's all the numbers like 2, 4, 6, and so on, up to but not including 91.

I remember that to find the number of even numbers less than a certain number, you can divide that number by 2 and then maybe adjust if necessary. Let me think: the largest even number less than 91 would be 90, right? Because 90 is even and 91 is odd. So the even numbers go up to 90.

So how many even numbers are there up to 90? Well, the first even number is 2, then 4, 6, etc., all the way to 90. This is an arithmetic sequence where each term increases by 2.

The formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence is a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d, where a_1 is the first term, d is the common difference, and n is the number of terms. Here, a_1 is 2, d is 2, and a_n is 90.

So plugging in the values: 90 = 2 + (n-1)*2. Let me solve for n. Subtract 2 from both sides: 88 = (n-1)*2. Divide both sides by 2: 44 = n -1. Then add 1: n = 45.

Wait, that gives me 45 even numbers. Let me check that another way. If I take 90 divided by 2, that's 45. So there are 45 even numbers less than 91. That makes sense because each even number is 2 times an integer from 1 up. So 2×1=2, 2×2=4, ..., 2×45=90.

Looking back at the options, option B is 45. So I think the answer is B.

But wait a second, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Sometimes when counting, it's easy to off-by-one errors. Let's list a few to check. The first few even numbers are 2,4,6,8,...,90. How many terms? Well, 90 divided by 2 is 45. Yes, that's correct.

Alternatively, think about all numbers from 1 to 90. Half of them are even, but since 90 is even, it's exactly half. So 90/2 =45. Yep, that's right.

So I'm confident the answer is 45, which is option B.

The product of a and b is 91. The even positive integers less than 91 are 2, 4, 6, ..., 90. There are 45 such numbers. 

Answer: B
