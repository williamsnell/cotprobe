Okay, so I'm trying to answer this question about the concentration of triacylglycerols in fats. The question is asking what percentage fats normally contain triacylglycerols, and the options are from A to J. I remember that triacylglycerols are a type of lipid, and I think they are also called triglycerides. 

Fats, in general, are made up of triglycerides. So, I'm pretty sure that the majority of what we refer to as fats are triglycerides. But wait, do they make up more than 95%? Or is it a bit lower? I think that in most biological samples, like when you eat fat or when it's stored in the body, triglycerides are the predominant form. 

I recall that triglycerides are the most common type of fat in the diet and in the body. They're made of three fatty acid chains attached to a glycerol backbone. Other types of lipids include phospholipids and sterols, but those are usually in smaller amounts. So if triacylglycerols are the main component, they should be the highest percentage.

Looking at the options, option A is ">95%", which is more than 95%, and option B is 95-100%. I'm trying to remember if it's more than 95 or if it's up to 100. Well, in reality, it's almost impossible for something to be 100% of a mixture, so I think it's more than 95% but less than 100. So perhaps option A is correct. But wait, maybe they're considered to be almost 100%?

Wait, another thought: sometimes in biochemistry, when we talk about typical composition, triglycerides are said to be the major component, but maybe not always 100%. So if the question says "at concentrations of", and I'm considering normal concentrations, I think the answer is that they're usually more than 95%, so option A. But I'm a bit confused because I might be mixing up with other sources.

Alternatively, I've heard that in some contexts, like in vegetable oils, the triglyceride content is very high, sometimes over 95%. So for fats in general, like when you have a fat-rich food or body fat, triglycerides make up the majority, so more than 95% seems right. Therefore, the answer should be A: >95%.

The correct answer is A: >95%. Fats are primarily composed of triacylglycerols (triglycerides), which typically make up more than 95% of fat content. 

Answer: A
