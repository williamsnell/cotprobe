Question:

A laboratory manufactures nitroglycerin (a heavy, oily, explosive, poisonous liquid used chiefly in making dynamite) at its main plant. An artist who specialized in making delicate glass sculptures had a studio two blocks away from the laboratory's plant. Late one evening, there was an explosion at the laboratory's plant. The force of the explosion caused the artist's studio to be shaken, which resulted in the destruction of valuable artwork in the studio. The artist now asserts a tort action against the laboratory to recover damages. Which of the following, if established, would furnish the laboratory with its best possible defense?

Options:

A: The laboratory had previously survived similar incidents without any damage to surrounding properties.
B: The laboratory used extraordinary care in the manufacture and storage of nitroglycerin and was not guilty of any negligence that was causally connected with the explosion.
C: The artist did not have appropriate safety measures in place to protect their artwork.
D: The laboratory had all necessary permits and licenses to manufacture nitroglycerin.
E: The harm that the artist suffered would not have resulted but for the abnormal fragility of the artist's work.
F: The artist had previously accepted compensation for potential risks due to their proximity to the laboratory.
G: The artist had been warned about potential risks due to their proximity to the laboratory.
H: The laboratory was not aware of the artist's studio being in close proximity to their plant.
I: The laboratory has a contract with the federal government whereby all the nitroglycerin manufactured at its plant is used in U. S. military weapons systems.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this tort law question about nitroglycerin explosion and the artist's claim. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the scenario: A lab makes nitroglycerin, which is a dangerous explosive. An artist has a studio nearby, and an explosion happens, damaging the artist's work. The artist is suing for damages. The question is asking which defense would be best for the lab.

I remember that in tort law, when someone is suing for negligence, the defendant can have several defenses. The main ones I can think of are contributory negligence, assumption of risk, comparative negligence, and maybe even if the plaintiff was the cause of their own injury.

Looking at the options, let's go through each one.

Option A: The lab had survived similar incidents without damage. Hmm, I'm not sure if this is a good defense. It might show that they were careful before, but if they were negligent this time, that doesn't necessarily help. It's more about past conduct, not the current claim.

Option B: The lab used extraordinary care and wasn't negligent. That sounds like a defense if they can prove they were not negligent. If they weren't negligent, they wouldn't be liable. So this could be a strong defense because it negates the negligence element.

Option C: The artist didn't have safety measures. This sounds like contributory negligence or assumption of risk. If the artist didn't protect their own property, maybe that reduces their recovery. But I'm not sure if that's a complete defense or just a partial one.

Option D: They had all necessary permits. I don't think a permit would be a defense to negligence. Permits are about legality, not about whether they were careful. So probably not relevant here.

Option E: The damage wouldn't have happened without the artist's fragile work. That might be a factual element, but it's more about causation. If the artist's work was unusually fragile, maybe the lab's negligence wasn't the proximate cause. But I'm not sure if that's a strong defense.

Option F: The artist accepted compensation for risks. That sounds like assumption of risk. If the artist knew the risks and accepted them, maybe they can't sue. But I think assumption of risk usually requires knowing and voluntary acceptance. Just accepting compensation might not be enough.

Option G: The artist was warned about the risks. Similar to F, this is about assumption of risk. If the artist knew and didn't take precautions, maybe they can't recover. But I think a warning alone might not be sufficient unless the artist actually understood and agreed.

Option H: The lab didn't know the studio was nearby. This could relate to whether they owed a duty. If they didn't know, maybe they couldn't have foreseen the risk. But I'm not sure how strong that is. If they should have known, even if they didn't, it might not matter.

Option I: They have a contract with the government for military use. Not sure how relevant that is. It might show they were following orders, but in tort law, that's more about duty than negligence. Unless it's a defense like government contract immunity, but I don't think that's a common tort defense.

So, considering all options, the best defense would likely be proving they weren't negligent (Option B). If the lab can show they took extraordinary care and weren't negligent, that would directly defend against the tort claim. Alternatively, options C, F, and G are about the artist's contributory negligence or assumption of risk, which could reduce damages but might not be the best complete defense. Option B seems the strongest because it directly negates the negligence element required for the tort claim.

The best possible defense for the laboratory would be to establish that they used extraordinary care and were not negligent, thereby negating the negligence element of the tort claim. 

Answer: B
