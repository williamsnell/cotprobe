Okay, so I have this problem where I'm given two positive integers. The least common multiple (LCM) of these two numbers, when divided by their greatest common divisor (GCD), equals 33. One of the integers is 45, and I need to find the smallest possible value of the other integer from the given options.

Let me start by recalling some math concepts. I remember that for any two positive integers, the product of their LCM and GCD is equal to the product of the numbers themselves. So, if the two numbers are a and b, then LCM(a,b) * GCD(a,b) = a * b. That seems right.

In this problem, one number is 45, and the other is unknown, let's call it x. So, according to the formula, LCM(45, x) * GCD(45, x) = 45 * x. 

But wait, the problem says that LCM(45, x) divided by GCD(45, x) is 33. So, LCM(45, x) / GCD(45, x) = 33. I can rearrange this equation. Let me write it down:

LCM(45, x) = 33 * GCD(45, x)

Now, substituting this into the earlier formula, I get:

(33 * GCD(45, x)) * GCD(45, x) = 45 * x

Which simplifies to:

33 * (GCD(45, x))^2 = 45 * x

Hmm, so 33 times the square of the GCD equals 45 times x. I can rearrange this to solve for x:

x = (33 / 45) * (GCD(45, x))^2

Simplify 33/45. Both are divisible by 3: 33 ÷ 3 = 11, 45 ÷3=15. So, 33/45 = 11/15. So,

x = (11/15) * (GCD(45, x))^2

Since x has to be an integer, (GCD(45, x))^2 must be a multiple of 15 to cancel out the denominator. Let me think about possible values for GCD(45, x). The GCD must be a divisor of 45. The divisors of 45 are 1, 3, 5, 9, 15, 45.

So, let's test each possible GCD value to find the smallest x.

Starting with the smallest possible GCD, which is 1:

If GCD = 1,

x = (11/15) * (1)^2 = 11/15. That's not an integer, so this can't be possible.

Next, GCD = 3:

x = (11/15) * (3)^2 = (11/15)*9 = 99/15 = 6.6. Not an integer, so no.

GCD =5:

x = (11/15)*(5)^2 = (11/15)*25 = 275/15 = 18.333... Not integer, so nope.

GCD=9:

x= (11/15)*(9)^2= (11/15)*81= 891/15= 59.4. Not an integer.

GCD=15:

x= (11/15)*(15)^2= (11/15)*225= 11*15=165. So x=165. That's an integer. Okay, so possible.

GCD=45:

x= (11/15)*(45)^2= (11/15)*2025= 11*135=1485. That's a larger number, so probably not the smallest.

Wait, but I was looking for the smallest possible x. So among the possible GCDs, the smallest x from the options given is 165, but wait, let me check if there's a smaller x possible.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me think again. Because I'm considering the GCDs of 45 and x as 1,3,5,9,15,45. But perhaps a smaller x can be found with a higher GCD? Or did I miss any possible GCDs?

Wait, another approach. Let me denote d = GCD(45, x). So, d must be a divisor of 45, as I did before. Let me express 45 as d * m, and x as d * n, where m and n are integers that are coprime (since we've factored out the GCD). So, 45 = d*m, x = d*n, and GCD(m, n) = 1.

Then, LCM(45, x) would be LCM(d*m, d*n) = d * m * n, since m and n are coprime. 

From the problem statement, LCM(45, x) / GCD(45, x) = (d*m*n) / d = m*n =33.

So, m * n =33.

Now, since 45 = d*m, and d is a divisor of 45, let's list possible d and m pairs.

Possible d values are 1,3,5,9,15,45.

So for each d, m would be 45/d.

Let me list them:

d | m =45/d | n (such that m*n=33)
1 | 45 | n=33/45 → Not integer, so invalid.
3 | 15 | n=33/15 = 2.2 → Not integer.
5 |9 | n=33/9 ≈3.666 → Not integer.
9 |5 | n=33/5=6.6 → Not integer.
15 |3 | n=33/3=11 → Integer.
45 |1 | n=33/1=33 → Integer.

So only when d=15 and d=45, n is integer.

So, let's compute x for each valid case.

Case 1: d=15, m=3, n=11.

x = d * n =15 *11=165.

Case 2: d=45, m=1, n=33.

x=45*33=1485.

So, the possible x values are 165 and 1485. Among these, the smallest is 165. But wait, looking back at the options, option D is 165, but I'm supposed to find the smallest possible x. But wait, maybe I missed something because I think there's a way to get a smaller x.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Let me re-examine.

Wait, when I set 45 = d*m and x = d*n, and m and n are coprime, and m*n=33.

Wait, 33 factors are 1 and 33, 3 and 11.

So, possible pairs for m and n are (1,33), (3,11), (11,3), (33,1). But since m must be 45/d, which is an integer, and d must be a divisor of 45.

So, let's see:

Looking for m such that m is a divisor of 45/d, and m*n=33, with n being integer.

Wait, perhaps another approach: since m and n are factors of 33, and m must be a factor of 45/d.

Wait, perhaps I should list all possible m and n pairs where m*n=33 and m divides 45/d.

Let me consider possible m and n:

1. m=1, n=33 → Then 45 = d*1 → d=45. So x =45*33=1485.

2. m=3, n=11 → 45 = d*3 → d=15. So x=15*11=165.

3. m=11, n=3 → 45 =d*11 → d=45/11, which is not integer, so invalid.

4. m=33, n=1 → 45 =d*33 → d=45/33=15/11, which is not integer, invalid.

So, only valid cases are when m=3, n=11 (x=165) and m=1, n=33 (x=1485). So, the smallest x is 165.

Wait, but looking at the options, 165 is option D. But let me check if the options have a smaller number. The options given are A:225, B:15, C:90, D:165, E:46, F:30, G:9, H:66, I:45, J:135.

Wait, 165 is the smallest among the possible x's. But perhaps I made a mistake because I think there might be a smaller x.

Wait, let me try plugging in x=15, which is option B. Let's see if that works.

If x=15, then GCD(45,15)=15. LCM(45,15)=45. So, LCM / GCD =45/15=3. But the problem states it should be 33. So, 3≠33. So x=15 is invalid.

What about x=30 (option F). GCD(45,30)=15. LCM(45,30)=90. 90/15=6≠33. So no.

x=9 (option G). GCD(45,9)=9. LCM=45. 45/9=5≠33.

x=66 (H). Let's compute GCD(45,66). Factors of 45: 3^2*5. Factors of 66: 2*3*11. So GCD is 3. LCM is (45*66)/3 = (45*22)=990. Then 990/3=330≠33. So no.

x=45 (I). GCD=45. LCM=45. 45/45=1≠33.

x=135 (J). GCD(45,135)=45. LCM=135. 135/45=3≠33.

x=90 (C). GCD(45,90)=45. LCM=90. 90/45=2≠33.

x=225 (A). GCD(45,225)=45. LCM=225. 225/45=5≠33.

x=46 (E). Let's compute GCD(45,46)=1. LCM=45*46=2070. 2070/1=2070≠33.

So, none of the other options except 165 (D) satisfy the condition. So the smallest possible x is 165.

Wait, but earlier I thought maybe I missed a smaller x. But looking through the options, 165 is the only one that works. So the answer should be D:165.

The problem involves finding the smallest positive integer \( x \) such that when the least common multiple (LCM) of 45 and \( x \) is divided by their greatest common divisor (GCD), the result is 33. 

Using the relationship \( \text{LCM}(a, b) \times \text{GCD}(a, b) = a \times b \), we express the given condition as \( \text{LCM}(45, x) / \text{GCD}(45, x) = 33 \). Substituting \( \text{LCM}(45, x) = 33 \times \text{GCD}(45, x) \) into the formula, we derive \( 33 \times (\text{GCD}(45, x))^2 = 45 \times x \). Simplifying, \( x = \frac{11}{15} \times (\text{GCD}(45, x))^2 \).

Considering the divisors of 45, we test each possible GCD to find the smallest \( x \). Only when \( \text{GCD}(45, x) = 15 \) does \( x \) yield an integer value of 165. Checking other options, none satisfy the condition except 165.

Thus, the smallest possible value of the other integer is **D: 165**.
