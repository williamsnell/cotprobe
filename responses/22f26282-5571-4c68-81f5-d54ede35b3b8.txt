Okay, so I have this sequence a_n where each term is between 0 and 1, and it satisfies the condition (1 - a_n)a_{n+1} > 1/4 for all n. I need to find the limit of a_n as n approaches infinity. Hmm, let's break this down.

First, I know that if the sequence converges, then the limit L must satisfy the condition derived from the recursion. So, assuming a_n approaches L, then a_{n+1} should also approach L. So substituting into the inequality, I get (1 - L)L ≥ 1/4. But wait, the inequality is strict: (1 - a_n)a_{n+1} > 1/4. So in the limit, it should be (1 - L)L ≥ 1/4. So I can write the equation (1 - L)L = 1/4.

Let me expand that: L - L² = 1/4. Rearranging, I get L² - L + 1/4 = 0. Solving this quadratic equation, the discriminant is b² - 4ac = 1 - 4*(1/4) = 1 -1 = 0. So there's a repeated root. L = [1 ± sqrt(0)] / 2 = 1/2. So L = 0.5.

Wait, but the original inequality is (1 - a_n)a_{n+1} > 1/4. So in the limit, it's (1 - L)L ≥ 1/4. But since the sequence terms are approaching L, and each term is strictly greater than 1/4 when multiplied by (1 - a_n), does that mean that L must satisfy (1 - L)L > 1/4? But when I solved the equation, I got equality. Hmm, maybe the limit still holds because the inequality is approaching from above.

Alternatively, perhaps the sequence doesn't settle exactly at 0.5 but stays just above it, but I think the limit would still be 0.5 because the inequality is strict but as n increases, the terms can approach the limit as closely as needed from either side.

Wait, but let me check. Suppose a_n approaches 0.5. Then (1 - 0.5)*0.5 = 0.25, which is exactly 1/4. But the condition is that it's greater than 1/4. So in the limit, the product approaches 1/4, but each term's product is strictly greater. Does that mean the limit could be equal to 0.5? Because if the product is always greater than 1/4, as n approaches infinity, the product approaches 1/4 from above, so L must be 0.5. That makes sense.

So the limit should be 0.5, which is option C.

The sequence a_n is bounded between 0 and 1 and satisfies (1 - a_n)a_{n+1} > 1/4 for all n. Assuming the sequence converges to a limit L, substituting into the inequality gives (1 - L)L ≥ 1/4. Solving the equation (1 - L)L = 1/4 leads to L = 0.5. Thus, the limit is 0.5.
