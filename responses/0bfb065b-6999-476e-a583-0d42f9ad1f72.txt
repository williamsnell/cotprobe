Okay, so I have this question about bonds and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me start by understanding what the question is asking. The question says, "A bond yielding 5% interest pays annual interest of $2.50. What is the face value of the bond?" And then there are several options to choose from.

Hmm, I remember that bonds have something called a face value, which is also known as the par value. The face value is the amount the bond will pay back to the investor when it matures. The interest, or the coupon payment, is usually a percentage of this face value. So the formula I think I need is: Interest = (Face Value × Coupon Rate).

Wait, let me make sure I have that right. If the bond has a 5% coupon rate, then each year it pays 5% of its face value as interest. And in this case, the annual interest is $2.50. So I can rearrange the formula to solve for the face value.

So, Face Value = Annual Interest / Coupon Rate. Plugging in the numbers, that would be $2.50 divided by 5%. But I need to make sure I handle the percentage correctly. 5% is the same as 0.05 in decimal form. So the calculation becomes $2.50 / 0.05.

Let me do that math. 2.5 divided by 0.05. Hmm, 0.05 goes into 2.5 how many times? Well, 0.05 times 50 is 2.5 because 0.05 × 50 = 2.5. So that means the face value is $50. 

Looking at the options, D is $50. So I think that's the correct answer. But wait, just to double-check, if the face value was $50 and the coupon rate is 5%, then 5% of 50 is indeed 2.50. Yeah, that makes sense. I don't think I made any mistakes here. So I'm pretty confident the answer is D.

The bond's annual interest is $2.50, and the coupon rate is 5%. Using the formula Face Value = Annual Interest / Coupon Rate, we calculate $2.50 / 0.05 = $50. Therefore, the face value is $50.

Answer: D
