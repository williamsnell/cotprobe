Okay, so I need to figure out the relative intensities of the secondary maxima in a single-slit Fraunhofer diffraction pattern. Hmm, I remember that in single-slit diffraction, the pattern consists of a central bright maximum and then alternating dark and light bands called secondary maxima and minima. The intensities of these secondary maxima decrease as you move away from the central maximum.

Wait, I think the formula for the intensity distribution involves the square of the sine function divided by something. Oh right, the intensity is proportional to (sin α / α)^2, where α is given by (π a sinθ)/λ, and a is the slit width. But the secondary maxima occur at specific values where the denominator is a multiple of half-integers, like α = (m + 1/2)π, for m = 1, 2, 3, etc.

So for the first secondary maximum, m=1, so α = (3/2)π. Then the intensity would be (sin(3π/2) / (3π/2))^2. Wait, sin(3π/2) is -1, so squared becomes 1. So it's (1/(3π/2))² = (2/(3π))². Let me calculate that: 2 is about 6.283/3 ≈ 2.094, so 2/3π is roughly 0.2122. Squared would be around 0.045. Hmm, but wait, I think the central maximum is the brightest, but the secondary maxima are much less intense. Oh wait, maybe I'm getting confused. The primary maxima are the ones between the minima, right?

Wait, no, the central maximum is the brightest, and the secondary maxima are the next brightest but much less. The first secondary maximum is approximately 4.5% of the central maximum's intensity. Then the next one is even smaller. I think the relative intensities of the secondary maxima follow a pattern where each subsequent one is about a third of the previous? Or maybe a factor that decreases as you go further.

Wait, I should recall the formula for the intensity of the secondary maxima. The intensity at the m-th secondary maximum is given by I_m = [ (sin( (2m+1)π/2 )) / ( (2m+1)π/2 ) ]^2. Wait, no, perhaps it's better to use the formula for the secondary maxima. Let me think. The positions of the secondary maxima are at α = (m + 1/2)π, where m is 1,2,3,... So for m=1, α=3π/2; m=2, α=5π/2; m=3, it's 7π/2, and so on.

The intensity at each secondary maximum is proportional to [sin(α)/α]^2. So for each m, the intensity is [sin( (2m+1)π/2 ) / ( (2m+1)π/2 )]^2. Let's compute that for m=1,2,3.

For m=1: α = 3π/2. sin(3π/2) = -1. So intensity is (1/(3π/2))² = (2/(3π))². 3π is about 9.4248, so 2/9.4248 ≈ 0.2122. Squared is approximately 0.045, which is 4.5%. So first secondary maximum is about 0.045.

For m=2: α=5π/2. sin(5π/2)=1. So (1/(5π/2))² = (2/(5π))². 5π≈15.70796, 2/15.70796≈0.1273. Squared is about 0.0162, which is 1.62%.

Wait, but wait, I think I might have made a mistake. Because the first secondary maximum is the brightest, but maybe the first is actually the first minima after the central maximum, but no, the secondary maxima occur between the minima. So the first secondary maximum after the central maximum is at m=1, which we calculated as ~0.045. Then the next one, m=2, is ~0.016. And the third one would be m=3, which is at 7π/2. So sin(7π/2)= -1. So (1/(7π/2))² = (2/(7π))². 7π≈21.9911, 2/21.9911≈0.091. Squared is about 0.00828, which is approximately 0.0083.

So the relative intensities for the first three secondary maxima are approximately 0.045, 0.016, and 0.0083. Looking at the options, option C is 0.045, 0.016, 0.0083. So that must be the correct answer.

The relative intensities of the secondary maxima in a single-slit Fraunhofer diffraction pattern decrease as you move away from the central maximum. Using the formula for intensity, \( I_m \propto \left(\frac{\sin(\alpha)}{\alpha}\right)^2 \), where \( \alpha = (m + 1/2)\pi \), we calculate the intensities for the first three secondary maxima:

1. For \( m=1 \) (\( \alpha = 3\pi/2 \)): \( I_1 \propto \left(\frac{2}{3\pi}\right)^2 \approx 0.045 \).
2. For \( m=2 \) (\( \alpha = 5\pi/2 \)): \( I_2 \propto \left(\frac{2}{5\pi}\right)^2 \approx 0.016 \).
3. For \( m=3 \) (\( \alpha = 7\pi/2 \)): \( I_3 \propto \left(\frac{2}{7\pi}\right)^2 \approx 0.0083 \).

Comparing these values with the options, the correct choice is:

C: 0.045, 0.016, 0.0083.
