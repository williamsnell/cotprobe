Okay, so I've got this question about the effective rate of yield for a stock. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my finance terms, but I'll try to work through it. Let me read the question again.

The stock is selling for $60 and pays an annual dividend of $2. I need to find the effective rate of yield. The options are A through D, with some percentages given. 

Wait, effective rate of yield... I think that's another term for the dividend yield, right? Dividend yield is usually calculated as the annual dividend divided by the stock price, then multiplied by 100 to get a percentage. So the formula should be (Dividend / Price) * 100.

Let me plug in the numbers. The dividend is $2, and the stock price is $60. So 2 divided by 60 equals... let's see, 2/60 is 0.033333... To convert that to a percentage, I multiply by 100, so that's 3.333...%. 

Looking at the options, option B is 3(1/3)%, which is the same as 3.333...%. So that should be the correct answer. 

Wait, let me make sure I'm not mixing up anything. Effective rate of yield doesn't usually involve compounding, right? It's just the simple return based on the dividend. So yeah, it's straightforward division. 

I think I'm confident with that. The answer should be B.

The effective rate of yield is calculated by dividing the annual dividend by the stock price and then converting it to a percentage. For a $60 stock with a $2 dividend, this is (2/60) * 100 = 3.333...%, which corresponds to option B.

Answer: B
