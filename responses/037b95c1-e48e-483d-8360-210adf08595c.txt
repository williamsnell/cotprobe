Okay, so I need to figure out how much Paul Murphy should invest now to have $10,000 after 10 years with 4% annual compound interest. Hmm, I remember that compound interest involves the interest being calculated on the initial principal and also on the accumulated interest from previous periods. 

The formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where:
- A is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.
- P is the principal amount (the initial amount of money).
- r is the annual interest rate (decimal).
- n is the number of times that interest is compounded per year.
- t is the time the money is invested for in years.

In this case, the interest is compounded annually, so n would be 1. The rate is 4%, so r is 0.04. The time t is 10 years. We need to find P such that A is $10,000.

So the formula simplifies to A = P(1 + r)^t. Plugging in the numbers, we get 10,000 = P*(1 + 0.04)^10.

Wait, I think I can rearrange this to solve for P. So P = A / (1 + r)^t. That would be P = 10,000 / (1.04)^10.

I need to calculate (1.04)^10. Let me think, 1.04 to the power of 10. I might remember that 1.04^10 is approximately 1.4802. Let me double-check that. Hmm, 4% over 10 years, so the multiplier is about 1.4802. So P would be 10,000 divided by 1.4802, which is approximately 6,756. So looking at the options, option F is $6,756.00.

The correct answer is F: $6,756.00.
