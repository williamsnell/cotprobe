Question:

The structure of ATP synthase in the plasma membranes of bacteria is nearly identical to that in the mitochondria and chloroplasts of eukaryotic cells. This similarity best supports which of the following hypotheses?

Options:

A: The structure of ATP synthase is not evolutionarily significant.
B: Mitochondria are derived from ancient aerobic bacteria, and chloroplasts are derived from ancient photosynthetic bacteria.
C: Prokaryotic cells are derived from eukaryotic cells.
D: Eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells share a common ancestor.
E: The structure of ATP synthase evolved independently in eukaryotes and prokaryotes.
F: ATP synthase in mitochondria and chloroplasts was borrowed from bacteria through horizontal gene transfer.
G: Mitochondria and chloroplasts escaped from eukaryotic cells and formed aerobic and photosynthetic prokaryotes.
H: The structure of ATP synthase in eukaryotes and prokaryotes is an example of divergent evolution.
I: Mitochondria and chloroplasts are remnants of ancient viruses that infected eukaryotic cells.
J: The similarity of ATP synthase in bacteria, mitochondria, and chloroplasts is an example of convergent evolution.

Okay, so I've got this biology question in front of me about ATP synthase structures in different cells. Hmm, let me think through this step by step. I remember that ATP synthase is an enzyme involved in the production of ATP, the energy currency of the cell. The question says that the structure is nearly identical in bacteria (which are prokaryotes) and in the mitochondria and chloroplasts (which are organelles in eukaryotic cells). The question is asking which hypothesis this similarity supports best.

The options are A through J. Let me go through each one.

Option A: The structure of ATP synthase is not evolutionarily significant. Wait, that doesn't make sense. If the structure is nearly identical, it suggests it's significant because it's conserved through evolution. So A is probably not the right answer.

Option B: Mitochondria are derived from ancient aerobic bacteria, and chloroplasts are derived from ancient photosynthetic bacteria. Oh, I remember something about endosymbiosis. The idea is that mitochondria and chloroplasts were once free-living bacteria that were engulfed by a eukaryotic cell. This hypothesis explains why their structures are similar to bacteria. So B sounds plausible.

Option C: Prokaryotic cells are derived from eukaryotic cells. No, that's the opposite of what I know. Prokaryotes are thought to be the more ancient, simpler cells, and eukaryotes evolved from them. So C is unlikely.

Option D: Eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells share a common ancestor. Well, all life shares a common ancestor, but the similarity in ATP synthase might be more specific. Like, it's about how mitochondria and chloroplasts relate to bacteria, not just any prokaryote. So D is a possibility, but maybe not the best fit.

Option E: The structure of ATP synthase evolved independently in eukaryotes and prokaryotes. Convergent evolution would mean they evolved the same structure separately. But if they're nearly identical, it's more likely they inherited it from a common source rather than converging. So E might not be the best answer.

Option F: ATP synthase in mitochondria and chloroplasts was borrowed from bacteria through horizontal gene transfer. Horizontal gene transfer is possible, but I think the endosymbiosis theory is more widely accepted for organelles like mitochondria and chloroplasts. Plus, the question is about structure similarity, not gene transfer. So F is a possibility, but I'm not sure.

Option G: Mitochondria and chloroplasts escaped from eukaryotic cells and formed aerobic and photosynthetic prokaryotes. That sounds like the opposite of what happened. They were engulfed, not escaped. So G seems incorrect.

Option H: The structure of ATP synthase in eukaryotes and prokaryotes is an example of divergent evolution. Divergent evolution would mean that they diverged from a common ancestor and developed different structures. But since the structures are similar, it's more about conservation, not divergence. So H doesn't fit.

Option I: Mitochondria and chloroplasts are remnants of ancient viruses that infected eukaryotic cells. I don't recall this being the case. The endosymbiosis theory is more established, so I think I is unlikely.

Option J: The similarity of ATP synthase in bacteria, mitochondria, and chloroplasts is an example of convergent evolution. Convergent evolution would mean that each evolved the same structure independently. But again, given the similarity, it's more likely due to a common origin, like endosymbiosis, not convergence.

So, putting it all together, the best hypothesis is that mitochondria and chloroplasts originated from ancient bacteria. That's the endosymbiosis theory, which is option B. The similarity in ATP synthase supports this because it suggests that these organelles retained structures from their bacterial ancestors. Other options like D and F are possible, but B directly addresses the origin of these organelles from bacteria, which explains the structural similarity.

The similarity in the structure of ATP synthase between bacteria, mitochondria, and chloroplasts strongly supports the hypothesis that mitochondria and chloroplasts originated from ancient bacteria through endosymbiosis. This aligns with option B, as the shared structure indicates a common evolutionary origin rather than independent evolution or other mechanisms.

Answer: B
