Question:

A circus operates in a rural part of the county. It is the circus's practice to finish each day's entertainment by discharging a so-called aerial bomb into the sky. After exploding, the aerial bomb emits a spectacular rainbow fireworks display that is seen for miles around. One afternoon, a 10-year-old boy and a few friends went to the fairgrounds to see the circus. After paying their admission, they were about to enter the "big top" when the boy came upon an aerial bomb lying on the ground. Ignorant of what the object really was, but in an exploratory mood, the boy applied a match to the fuse of the fireworks device. It exploded and seriously injured the boy. After the accident, and before the parents of the boy had retained a lawyer, the adjuster for the circus's insurance carrier contacted the parents several times, trying to negotiate a settlement of their claim against the circus. On each occasion, the adjuster told the parents there was no need for them to hire an attorney because the applicable civil code did not provide for recovery in such a situation. The adjuster was aware that this information was blatantly false. He also warned the parents that unless they accepted his offered settlement of $5,000, they would receive nothing. For over a month, the adjuster continued to harass the parents. Outraged by the adjuster's actions, the parents sought the advice of a neighbor who recommended that they consult an attorney. The parents went ahead and retained a lawyer who subsequently negotiated a $250,000 settlement with the adjuster's insurance company for the claims relating to the boy's injury from the aerial bomb. If the parents assert a claim against the adjuster to recover damages for infliction of emotional distress, they will

Options:

A: not recover, because the adjuster's actions were part of his job duties.
B: recover, because the adjuster's actions constituted harassment.
C: not recover, because the parents took the advice of a neighbor and consulted an attorney.
D: not recover, because the parents did not suffer emotional distress that was severe.
E: not recover, because the parents eventually received a $250,000 settlement from the adjuster's insurance company.
F: recover, because the adjuster provided false information to the parents.
G: not recover, because the adjuster's actions did not directly cause the boy's injury.

Okay, so I have this question about tort law, specifically about intentional infliction of emotional distress. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The scenario is about a circus where a boy gets injured by an aerial bomb. The adjuster from the insurance company contacts the parents, tells them there's no need for a lawyer because the civil code doesn't allow recovery, which the adjuster knows is false. He also pressures them to accept a low settlement, and continues to harass them for over a month. Eventually, the parents get legal advice and settle for a much larger amount.

Now, the question is whether the parents can recover damages from the adjuster for infliction of emotional distress.

First, I remember that intentional infliction of emotional distress (IIED) requires proving four elements: (1) the defendant acted intentionally or recklessly; (2) the conduct was extreme and outrageous; (3) the actions caused the plaintiff emotional distress; and (4) the distress was severe.

Looking at the adjuster's actions: he lied to the parents about the law, knowing it was false. He also pressured them with a low settlement, warning they'd get nothing otherwise. This sounds like harassment and could be seen as extreme and outrageous. The adjuster's conduct was intentional because he knew the information was false and was trying to pressure the parents.

The parents did suffer emotional distress. They were outraged by the adjuster's actions, which makes sense. The question is whether that distress was severe enough. Courts typically require that the distress be more than just upset; it has to be something like trauma, shock, or something that affects their daily life. The parents were obviously upset because the adjuster was trying to take advantage of them, so I think that could be considered severe.

Option A says the adjuster's actions were part of his job. But IIED doesn't exempt job duties; if the conduct is extreme enough, it can still be actionable. So A might not be correct.

Option B says they can recover because of harassment. Harassment can be part of IIED, but it's not the only factor. The key is whether the conduct was extreme and outrageous. So B might be a point, but it's not the whole picture.

Option C says they can't recover because they consulted a neighbor and a lawyer. But seeking advice doesn't negate the emotional distress caused. The neighbor's advice might have helped them, but it doesn't mean the distress didn't happen.

Option D says no recovery because the distress wasn't severe. But given the facts, the parents were clearly under duress and likely suffered significant distress, so D might not hold.

Option E says no recovery because they got a settlement. But the claim is against the adjuster, not the insurance company. The fact that they settled with the company doesn't prevent them from suing the adjuster for his actions.

Option F says they can recover because the adjuster provided false info. False information alone might not be enough unless it's part of a pattern of behavior that's outrageous. Here, the adjuster's repeated harassment and false statements likely meet that.

Option G says no recovery because the adjuster didn't cause the injury. But the claim isn't about causing the injury; it's about the emotional distress from the adjuster's actions after the injury. So G isn't relevant here.

Putting it together, the adjuster's conduct was extreme and outrageous, done intentionally, causing severe emotional distress. Therefore, the parents should be able to recover. The correct answer would be F: recover because the adjuster provided false information. But wait, I think B (harassment) might also be a factor. However, I'm leaning towards F because the false information was part of the extreme conduct. Alternatively, maybe B is better because harassment is a form of extreme and outrageous behavior.

Wait, but IIED requires more than just harassment. It's about the nature of the conduct. The adjuster's lies and pressure could be seen as extreme. So, perhaps B is correct because harassment can be considered extreme and outrageous. Alternatively, F is correct because the false statements were part of the harassment.

Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The adjuster's actions included lying, harassment, and duress. Courts have held that certain types of harassment, especially when done with intent to cause distress, can constitute IIED. So B might be the better answer because the actions were harassment, which meets the extreme and outrageous standard.

But wait, the key is whether the adjuster's conduct was so extreme that it goes beyond all bounds of decency. Lying to them, knowing the truth, and pressuring them to accept a low settlement under false pretenses could be seen as outrageous. So maybe B is correct because the harassment was extreme.

Alternatively, the false information was part of the harassment, so both B and F could be factors. But in the options, F says "because the adjuster provided false information", which is part of the harassment. But the primary reason is the harassment itself, which is extreme and outrageous.

So maybe B is the correct answer because the actions were harassment, which is a form of extreme conduct. Therefore, the parents can recover.

The parents can recover because the adjuster's actions constituted harassment, which is considered extreme and outrageous under the applicable tort law. The adjuster's intentional and reckless conduct, including providing false information and pressuring the parents, caused severe emotional distress. Harassment fits the criteria for IIED as it goes beyond mere annoyances and involves behavior that is intended to cause distress. Therefore, the correct answer is:

B: recover, because the adjuster's actions constituted harassment.

Answer: B
