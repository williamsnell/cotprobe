Okay, so I have this physics problem here about three charged particles. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the problem says that particles 1 and 2 are on an x-axis, separated by L=9 cm. Particle 1 has a charge of +q, and particle 2 has +4q. We need to find the position of particle 3, which has charge q3, such that all three particles remain in place when released. That probably means that the net force on each particle is zero, so they don't move.

Wait, so for the system to be in equilibrium, each particle must have zero net force. So I need to consider the forces between each pair of particles and make sure that the sum of forces on each is zero.

Let me visualize this. Let's assume particles 1 and 2 are on the x-axis. Let me denote their positions. Let's say particle 1 is at x=0, and particle 2 is at x=9 cm. Then particle 3 can be somewhere along the x-axis. But where?

Wait, but wait—could particle 3 be between them, or on one side? Let me think. If particle 3 is between them, the forces from 1 and 2 on 3 might balance each other. Alternatively, if it's on the same side as one of them, the forces might balance there. Hmm.

Wait, but particles 1 and 2 are both positive charges. So, they will repel each other. So, if particle 3 is placed between them, it would be repelled by both, but maybe the forces can balance. Alternatively, if placed outside, say beyond particle 2, then the force from 1 would attract 3 (if 3 is negative) or repel if positive. Wait, but the problem doesn't specify the charge of q3. Oh, wait the question says q3 is such that the three particles remain in place when released. So, maybe q3 is negative, attracting both 1 and 2, but I'm not sure yet.

Wait, but let me think again. Let's denote the positions. Let me set particle 1 at x=0, particle 2 at x=9 cm. Let me denote the position of particle 3 as x. So, x can be to the left of 1 (x<0), between 1 and 2 (0 <x<9), or to the right of 2 (x>9).

Now, for each scenario, the forces on each particle must be zero. Let me consider each particle.

First, for particle 1: The force from particle 2 and the force from particle 3 must cancel out. Similarly for particle 2, the forces from 1 and 3 must cancel. For particle 3, the forces from 1 and 2 must cancel.

Wait, but if I place particle 3 between 1 and 2, then the force from 1 on 3 would be repulsive (since both are positive), pushing it to the right, and the force from 2 on 3 would be repulsive, pushing it to the left. So, if 3 is between them, these two forces might balance each other. Alternatively, if 3 is outside, say to the right of 2, then 1 would repel it to the right, and 2 would also repel it to the right. So those forces wouldn't cancel. So maybe 3 must be between 1 and 2.

Wait, but wait, if 3 is between 1 and 2, then both particles 1 and 2 would exert repulsive forces on 3 in opposite directions. So for 3 to be in equilibrium, the forces from 1 and 2 must balance each other. So the magnitude of the force from 1 on 3 should equal the magnitude of the force from 2 on 3, but in opposite directions.

But wait, let's write the equations. The force between two charges is given by Coulomb's law: F = k*(q1*q2)/(r^2), where r is the separation.

So, for particle 3 at position x between 1 (x=0) and 2 (x=9 cm), the distance from 1 to 3 is x, and from 2 to 3 is (9 - x) cm.

So the force from 1 on 3 would be F13 = k*(q * q3)/(x^2) directed to the right (since they are both positive, so repulsion).

The force from 2 on 3 would be F23 = k*(4q * q3)/((9 - x)^2) directed to the left (since 2 is at x=9, so force on 3 from 2 would push it left).

For equilibrium, F13 must equal F23 in magnitude, so:

k*q*q3 / x^2 = k*4q*q3 / (9 - x)^2.

Wait, but I can cancel out k, q, and q3 from both sides, assuming they are non-zero. So:

1/x^2 = 4/(9 - x)^2.

Taking square roots on both sides, 1/x = 2/(9 - x).

So:

(9 - x) = 2x.

So 9 = 3x → x=3 cm.

Wait, so x would be 3 cm from particle 1, which is at 0. That would place particle 3 at x=3 cm, which is between 0 and 9 cm. So the position is 3 cm from 0, which is 3 cm. So the x-coordinate is 3 cm.

Wait, but looking back at the options, option I is 3 cm. So that would be the answer. But let me double-check.

Wait, but wait, I assumed that the forces on 3 from 1 and 2 balance. But I also need to make sure that the forces on 1 and 2 from 3 are balanced as well, so that each of them doesn't move.

Wait, let's check that. For particle 1, the forces on it are from 2 and 3. The force from 2 on 1 is repulsive to the right (since both positive), and the force from 3 on 1 is repulsive to the left (if q3 is positive) or attractive to the right (if q3 is negative). Hmm, but I didn't assume the sign of q3 earlier. Let me think again.

Wait, in the earlier calculation, I assumed that particle 3 is between 1 and 2, and the forces from 1 and 2 on 3 are in opposite directions. But actually, if q3 is positive, then the forces from 1 and 2 on 3 would both be repulsive, meaning that 1 would push 3 to the right, and 2 would push 3 to the left, if 3 is between them. So for the net force on 3 to be zero, the magnitudes must be equal. But if q3 were negative, then 1 would attract 3 to the left, and 2 would attract it to the left as well, which wouldn't balance each other. So that can't be.

Wait, so perhaps q3 is negative. Then, the forces from 1 and 2 on 3 would both be attractive towards them. So if 3 is between them, 1 would pull 3 to the right, and 2 would pull 3 to the left, which would require the forces to balance. Wait, that makes sense.

Wait, let me clarify. If q3 is negative, then the force from 1 (positive) on 3 would be attractive, so pulling 3 towards 1, i.e., to the left. The force from 2 (positive) on 3 would also be attractive, pulling 3 towards 2, i.e., to the right if 3 is between 1 and 2. Wait, no, wait, if 3 is between 1 and 2, then 2 is to the right of 3, so 2 would pull 3 to the right. So 1 would pull 3 left, 2 would pull 3 right. So for equilibrium, the forces must balance.

So the magnitude of F13 (from 1 on 3) equals F23 (from 2 on 3). So same as before:

k*q*(-q3)/(x^2) = k*4q*(-q3)/( (9 -x)^2 )

Wait, but since I'm considering the forces on 3, the signs matter. Wait, perhaps I should just consider the magnitudes, regardless of direction. So the magnitude equation remains the same: F13 = F23.

So the earlier calculation was correct, leading to x=3 cm.

Now, let's check the forces on particles 1 and 2.

For particle 1, the forces are from 2 and 3. The force from 2 is to the right (repulsion, since both positive). The force from 3 is to the left (attraction, since 3 is negative). So these two forces must balance.

Similarly, for particle 2, the force from 1 is to the left (repulsion), and the force from 3 is to the right (attraction, since 3 is negative and 2 is positive, so 2 pulls 3 towards itself, which is to the right if 3 is between them). So for equilibrium, these forces must also balance.

Let me calculate the forces.

First, for particle 1:

Force from 2: F21 = k*(q * 4q)/(9^2) = (4kq²)/(81) cm².

Force from 3: F31 = k*(q * |q3|)/(x^2) = k*q*q3/(x^2), but since q3 is negative, the force is attractive, so direction is to the left. So magnitude is (k q |q3|)/(x^2).

Wait, but I think earlier I considered the forces on 3, leading to the condition F13 = F23.

But perhaps it's easier to proceed as follows: Once we've found x=3 cm for particle 3, let's compute the forces on each particle to ensure equilibrium.

Let me take x=3 cm.

So, particle 3 is at x=3 cm.

Compute the force on particle 1:

- From 2: F21 = k*(q *4q)/(9 cm)^2 = 4k q² / (81) cm².

- From 3: F31 = k*(q * |q3|)/(3 cm)^2 = k q |q3| / 9 cm².

For equilibrium, F31 must equal F21 in magnitude.

So:

k q |q3| /9 = 4k q² /81.

Cancel k, q:

|q3| /9 = 4 q /81 → |q3| = (4 q * 9) /81 → |q3| = (36 q)/(81) = (4 q)/(9).

So |q3|= (4/9) q.

Similarly, for particle 2, the forces:

- From 1: F12 = k*(4q * q)/(9 cm)^2 = 4k q² /81 cm².

- From 3: F32 = k*(4q * |q3|)/( (9-3) cm )^2 = k*(4 q |q3|)/(36 cm²).

So F32 = (4k q |q3| )/(36) = (k q |q3| )/9.

For equilibrium, F32 must equal F12:

k q |q3| /9 = 4k q² /81.

Same as before, which gives |q3|=4q/9.

So this works out. So the x-coordinate of particle 3 is 3 cm, which is option I.
</think>

To determine the equilibrium position of particle 3, we analyze the forces acting on each particle. Particles 1 and 2 are fixed at positions \(x=0\) and \(x=9.00\ \mathrm{cm}\), respectively, with charges \(+q\) and \(+4q\). Particle 3, with charge \(q_3\), must be placed such that the net force on each particle is zero.

### Key Observations:
1. **Forces on Particle 3**:  
   Particle 3 must experience equal and opposite forces from particles 1 and 2. Using Coulomb's law, the magnitudes of the forces are:  
   \[
   F_{13} = \frac{kq q_3}{x^2}, \quad F_{23} = \frac{k(4q) q_3}{(9 - x)^2}.
   \]  
   For equilibrium, \(F_{13} = F_{23}\), leading to:  
   \[
   \frac{q}{x^2} = \frac{4q}{(9 - x)^2}.
   \]  
   Simplifying gives:  
   \[
   \frac{1}{x^2} = \frac{4}{(9 - x)^2}.
   \]  
   Taking the square root:  
   \[
   \frac{1}{x} = \frac{2}{9 - x}.
   \]  
   Solving for \(x\):  
   \[
   9 - x = 2x \implies 9 = 3x \implies x = 3.00\ \mathrm{cm}.
   \]

2. **Forces on Particles 1 and 2**:  
   - For particle 1, the forces from particles 2 and 3 must balance.  
   - For particle 2, the forces from particles 1 and 3 must balance.  
   Substituting \(x = 3.00\ \mathrm{cm}\) into the force equations confirms equilibrium for all particles.

### Conclusion:
The equilibrium position of particle 3 is at \(x = 3.00\ \mathrm{cm}\), corresponding to **option I**.
