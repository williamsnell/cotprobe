Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's going on. 

There are two people on an ice-covered pond, which is frictionless. That probably means that the only forces acting are between the two people, so friction can be ignored. The two people are facing each other. One has a mass of 100 kg, and the other is 50 kg. The heavier person, which is the 100 kg one, pushes on the lighter one with a force F. The question is about what happens next.

The options are A through I, and I need to pick the correct one. Hmm, let's break this down. 

First, I remember Newton's third law, which states that when two objects interact, they exert equal and opposite forces on each other. So if the heavier person pushes the lighter one with a force F, the lighter one will push back with a force of -F. So the forces are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. That should help rule out some options.

Looking at the options, let's go through them one by one. 

Option A says the force felt by the heavier person is 2F. Wait, that doesn't sound right. According to Newton's third law, the heavier person would feel a force of -F, not 2F. So A is probably wrong.

Option B: The magnitude of the acceleration of the heavier person is half of the lighter's. Hmm, I'm not so sure about this. Let's think about acceleration. Acceleration is force divided by mass (a=F/m). So for the heavier person, their acceleration would be F divided by 100 kg, and the lighter person's acceleration would be F divided by 50 kg. Wait, no, because the force on the lighter person is F, right? Because the heavier person applies F, so the lighter feels F. Or is it?

Wait, wait, no. The heavier person applies a force F on the lighter, so the lighter experiences F. But the heavier's force is -F, as per Newton's third law. So for the heavier person, their acceleration is (-F)/100 kg, and the lighter's is F/50 kg. Let's compute the magnitudes. Heavier's a is F/100, lighter's is F/50. So the lighter's acceleration is twice as big as the heavier's. So the magnitude of the heavier's acceleration is half that of the lighter. So option B says that, making it correct. Wait, but I'm not sure if I'm getting the direction right here. But the question is about the magnitude, so direction doesn't matter. So B seems correct.

But let me check other options. Option C says the force felt by the lighter is -2F. That's not right because according to Newton's third law, it's just -F. So C is wrong. 

Option D: The magnitude of the lighter's acceleration is half of the heavier's. Wait, no, from earlier, the lighter's acceleration is twice as big as the heavier's. So D is the opposite of what's correct. So D is wrong.

Option E: Force on the heavier is -2F. Again, Newton's third law says it's -F, so E is wrong.

Option F: Heavier's acceleration is twice the lighter's. No, earlier calculation shows the lighter's acceleration is twice the heavier's, so F is wrong.

Option G: Force on lighter is (-1/2)F. No, it's -F, so G is wrong.

Option H: The lighter's acceleration is twice the heavier's. Wait, that's correct. Because a_heavy = F/100, a_light = F/50. So a_light is twice a_heavy. So H is correct. Wait, but earlier I thought B was correct. Oh wait, let me clarify. The question is about the magnitude. So the heavier's acceleration is F/100, and the lighter's is F/50. So the lighter's is twice as big. So the magnitude of the heavier's acceleration is half that of the lighter. So both B and H are correct? No, wait, B says the heavier's acceleration is half of the lighter's, which is true, and H says the lighter's is twice the heavier's, which is also true. Both statements are correct in magnitude. But looking at the options, both B and H are present. Wait, no, looking at the options again, let me check:

Option B: "the magnitude of the acceleration of the heavier person will be half of the magnitude of the acceleration of the lighter person." That's correct.

Option H: "the magnitude of the acceleration of the lighter person will be twice the magnitude of the acceleration of the heavier person." Also correct.

Wait, but the question is a multiple-choice, so perhaps only one is correct. But both B and H are correct statements. But looking back at the options, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me re-calculate.

Wait, no, Newton's third law says that the force on each is equal and opposite. So when the heavier person pushes with F, the lighter person feels F as well, but in the opposite direction. Wait, wait no, that's not correct. If the heavier person pushes the lighter with F, then the lighter person feels a force of F (since the heavier is applying F on him). But according to Newton's third law, the lighter person would push back on the heavier with a force of F in the opposite direction. So both feel a force of F but in opposite directions. Wait, no, wait. No, the heavier applies F on the lighter, so the lighter feels F. Then, the lighter applies F on the heavier, so the heavier feels F opposite. So each feels F but in opposite directions. So the force on the heavier is -F, and the lighter is F. So the magnitudes are both F, but signs are opposite.

Wait, that's conflicting with what I thought earlier. So if F is the force the heavy applies on the light, then the light feels F, and the heavy feels -F. So the forces are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. So the heavier's force is -F, and the lighter's is F.

So in that case, option B says the heavier's acceleration is half the lighter's. Let's see: a_heavy = F_heavy / m_heavy = (-F)/100. a_light = F_light / m_light = F/50. So the magnitudes are |a_heavy| = F/100, |a_light|= F/50. So |a_light|=2*(F/100)=2*a_heavy. So the lighter's acceleration is twice as big as the heavier's. So the heavier's acceleration is half the lighter's. So option B is correct.

Option H says the lighter's acceleration is twice the heavier's, which is also correct. So both B and H are correct? But wait, in the options, perhaps only one is correct. Let me check the options again.

Looking back, the options are:

B: the magnitude of the acceleration of the heavier person will be half of the magnitude of the acceleration of the lighter person.

H: the magnitude of the acceleration of the lighter person will be twice the magnitude of the acceleration of the heavier person.

So both B and H are correct because they're essentially saying the same thing but in opposite terms. But wait, no, because B says the heavier's acceleration is half the lighter's, which is correct, and H says the lighter's acceleration is twice the heavier's, which is also correct. But perhaps in the options, both B and H are present, but maybe only one is correct. Wait, no, the question is to choose which statement is correct.

Wait, but looking at the options, perhaps only one is correct. Let me think again. If the heavier's acceleration is F/100, and the lighter's is F/50, then the lighter's acceleration is twice as big. So the heavier's acceleration is half the lighter's. So B is correct. H is also correct because it's the same as B but phrased differently. Wait, no, H says the lighter's acceleration is twice the heavier's, which is correct. So both B and H are correct. But looking at the options again, perhaps the answer is H. Wait, wait, the options in the problem are:

H: the magnitude of the acceleration of the lighter person will be twice the magnitude of the acceleration of the heavier person.

Which is correct because a_light = F/(50) = 2*(F/100) = 2*a_heavy. So a_light is twice a_heavy.

So both B and H are correct. But looking at the options, perhaps only one is correct. Wait, but looking at the options, perhaps H is correct. Because the question is about the acceleration of the lighter person compared to the heavier's. So H is correct.

Wait, but I'm getting confused because both B and H seem correct. Let me think again: The acceleration of the heavier is a_heavy = F/(100), and the lighter is a_light = F/(50). So a_light = 2*a_heavy, meaning a_heavy = 0.5 a_light. So the magnitude of a_heavy is half of a_light. So B is correct, and H is also correct because it's twice as much.

Wait, but in the options, perhaps only one is correct. Wait, the options are:

B: a_heavy is half of a_light.

H: a_light is twice a_heavy.

So both are correct. But looking at the options, perhaps only one is present. Wait, looking back at the problem, options B and H are both present.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is H. Because the question is about the acceleration of the lighter person compared to the heavier. So the lighter accelerates twice as much as the heavier, so H is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is H, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again about the forces.

Another approach: When the heavier person pushes the lighter with F, the lighter accelerates with a_light = F/(50). The heavier accelerates with a_heavy = (-F)/(100) = -F/100. The magnitudes are |a_light|=F/50, |a_heavy|=F/100. So |a_light|=2*|a_heavy|. So the lighter accelerates twice as fast as the heavier, so the heavier's acceleration is half that of the lighter. So B and H are correct. But looking at the options, perhaps H is the correct option because it's phrased as the lighter's acceleration being twice the heavier's, which is what the calculation shows.

Wait, but the problem is that in the options, both B and H are correct. But looking at the options again, perhaps the correct answer is H.

Wait, let me check the other options again to make sure.

Options A and E are about the force on the heavier being 2F or -2F, which is incorrect because it's just -F.

Option C says the lighter feels -2F, which is wrong.

Option D says the lighter's acceleration is half the heavier's, which is wrong.

Option F says the heavier's acceleration is twice the lighter's, which is wrong.

Option G says the lighter feels (-1/2)F, which is wrong.

So the correct options are B and H. But wait, perhaps the question is designed so that only one is correct. Let me think again.

Wait, the problem says "the heavier person pushes on the lighter one with a force F." So the heavier applies F on the lighter. Then, by Newton's third law, the lighter applies -F on the heavier.

So the forces are F on the lighter and -F on the heavier.

So the acceleration of the lighter is a_light = F/(50 kg) = F/50.

The acceleration of the heavier is a_heavy = (-F)/(100 kg) = -F/100.

So the magnitudes are |a_light|=F/50, |a_heavy|=F/100.

So |a_light| = 2 * |a_heavy|.

Which means the heavier's acceleration is half that of the lighter. So option B is correct.

Option H says the lighter's acceleration is twice the heavier's, which is correct as well. So perhaps both B and H are correct, but looking at the options, perhaps only one is intended to be correct.

Wait, but looking at the options, perhaps H is the correct one because it's the reciprocal. Let me see.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the acceleration ratio. The acceleration is inversely proportional to mass. So since the lighter person has half the mass of the heavier, their acceleration would be twice as much for the same force. So the lighter accelerates twice as much as the heavier. So H is correct.

Alternatively, if the problem is asking which is correct, then both B and H are correct. But in the options given, perhaps only H is correct because it's the correct relationship.

Wait, but the options are:

B: a_heavy = 0.5 a_light.

H: a_light = 2 a_heavy.

Both are correct. So perhaps the correct answer is H, but I'm a bit confused because both B and H are correct.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the other options again. So option H is correct, and option B is also correct. But perhaps only one is present in the options. Let me check the options again.

Wait, looking back, the options are:

A: the force felt by the heavier person is 2F → wrong.

B: a_heavy = 0.5 a_light → correct.

C: the force felt by the lighter is -2F → wrong.

D: a_light = 0.5 a_heavy → wrong.

E: the force felt by the heavier is -2F → wrong.

F: a_heavy = 2 a_light → wrong.

G: the force felt by the lighter is (-1/2)F → wrong.

H: a_light = 2 a_heavy → correct.

I: the force felt by the heavier is (-1/2)F → wrong.

So both B and H are correct. But looking at the options, perhaps the intended correct answer is H.

Wait, but in the problem, only one option can be correct. So perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me think again.

Wait, the heavier person's acceleration is F/100 (magnitude), and the lighter's is F/50. So the lighter's acceleration is twice the heavier's. So option H is correct.

But option B says the heavier's acceleration is half of the lighter's, which is also correct because (F/100) = 0.5*(F/50).

So both B and H are correct. But in the options given, perhaps only one is correct. Maybe the answer is H.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is H because it's the more direct statement about the lighter's acceleration being twice the heavier's. But I'm a bit confused now.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the problem again. The heavier person pushes the lighter with F. So the lighter accelerates with F/m_light = F/50. The heavier accelerates with F/m_heavy = F/100, but in the opposite direction. So the magnitude of the heavier's acceleration is F/100, which is half of F/50. So the heavier's acceleration is half that of the lighter's. So option B is correct.

Alternatively, the lighter's acceleration is twice the heavier's, so H is correct.

But since both B and H are correct, perhaps the answer expects one of them. But looking at the options, perhaps the correct answer is H, as it directly states the lighter's acceleration is twice the heavier's.

Wait, perhaps I should check the problem again. The problem says "the heavier person pushes on the lighter one with a force F." So the force on the lighter is F, and the force on the heavier is -F.

So the accelerations are:

a_heavy = (-F)/100 → magnitude F/100.

a_light = F/50 → magnitude F/50.

So F/50 = 2*(F/100), so a_light is twice a_heavy. So option H is correct.

So the correct answer is H.

The problem involves two people on a frictionless ice pond: one with a mass of 100 kg (heavier) and the other with a mass of 50 kg (lighter). The heavier person pushes the lighter person with a force \( F \). Using Newton's third law, the lighter person exerts an equal and opposite force \( -F \) on the heavier person. 

To analyze the accelerations, we use Newton's second law, \( a = F/m \). 

1. **Force Analysis**:  
   - The heavier person applies a force \( F \) on the lighter person.  
   - By Newton's third law, the lighter person applies a force \( -F \) on the heavier person.  

2. **Acceleration Calculation**:  
   - For the heavier person (\( m = 100 \, \text{kg} \)):  
     \[
     a_{\text{heavy}} = \frac{-F}{100}
     \]  
     The magnitude of acceleration is \( |a_{\text{heavy}}| = \frac{F}{100} \).  
   - For the lighter person (\( m = 50 \, \text{kg} \)):  
     \[
     a_{\text{light}} = \frac{F}{50}
     \]  
     The magnitude of acceleration is \( |a_{\text{light}}| = \frac{F}{50} \).  

3. **Acceleration Ratio**:  
   - The lighter person's acceleration is twice that of the heavier person:  
     \[
     |a_{\text{light}}| = 2 \cdot |a_{\text{heavy}}|
     \]  

4. **Option Analysis**:  
   - **Option B**: "The magnitude of the acceleration of the heavier person will be half of the magnitude of the acceleration of the lighter person." This is correct because \( |a_{\text{heavy}}| = \frac{1}{2} |a_{\text{light}}| \).  
   - **Option H**: "The magnitude of the acceleration of the lighter person will be twice the magnitude of the acceleration of the heavier person." This is also correct because \( |a_{\text{light}}| = 2 \cdot |a_{\text{heavy}}| \).  

Both options B and H are correct based on the calculations. However, since the question likely expects a single answer, **H** is the more direct statement about the lighter person's acceleration being twice the heavier person's.

Answer: H
