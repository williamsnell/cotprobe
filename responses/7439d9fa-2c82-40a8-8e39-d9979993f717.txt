Okay, so I've got this question about resistors and energy dissipation. Hmm, I remember that resistors dissipate energy when there's a current passing through them. The question says that a resistor is dissipating energy at a rate of 1 W, and then the voltage across it is doubled. I need to find the new rate of energy dissipation.

Wait, I think power in a resistor is calculated using the formula P = V²/R. Oh right, because power is voltage squared divided by resistance. So if the voltage across the resistor changes, the power changes accordingly.

In this case, the initial power is 1 W. That's when the voltage is V. So according to the formula, P = V²/R. Now, the voltage is being doubled, so the new voltage is 2V. What happens to the power then?

Let me plug it into the formula again. New power P' would be (2V)² divided by R. So (2V)^2 is 4V². Then, 4V² divided by R. So P' = 4V²/R.

But wait, the original power P was V²/R, which equals 1 W. So P' is 4 times (V²/R), which is 4 * 1 W. So that would make P' = 4 W. Oh, so the power would quadruple when the voltage doubles because power is proportional to the square of the voltage (since resistance stays the same).

So looking at the options, option G is 4 W. Therefore, the correct answer should be G.

The power dissipated by a resistor is given by \( P = \frac{V^2}{R} \). Initially, the power is 1 W, so \( V^2/R = 1 \, \text{W} \). When the voltage is doubled to \( 2V \), the new power becomes \( \frac{(2V)^2}{R} = \frac{4V^2}{R} = 4 \times \frac{V^2}{R} = 4 \, \text{W} \). Therefore, the new power is 4 W.

Answer: G
