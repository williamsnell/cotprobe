Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about contract law, specifically regarding rewards and whether someone can claim a reward they weren't aware of. Let me try to break this down step by step.

The scenario is that a man's brother was murdered, and he offered a $10,000 reward in the newspaper for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the murderer. An amateur detective, who didn't know about this reward, started investigating on his own because he was curious about the sensational case. A week later, the detective got information that led to the arrest and conviction. Then, during the trial, he found out about the reward and asked for the $10,000. Now, the detective is suing to get the reward, and we have to determine if he'll succeed.

So, the question is about whether the detective is entitled to the reward despite not knowing about it when he did his work.

First, I remember that rewards can be considered offers in contract law. Typically, a reward offer is a unilateral contract, meaning one party makes an offer, and the other accepts by performing the action specified. For example, the classic case is when someone offers a reward for finding a lost dog, and once the dog is found, the finder can claim the reward.

In this case, the offer was made publicly in the newspaper. The detective didn't know about the offer when he started his investigation. But he still provided the information that led to the arrest and conviction. So the question is, does his lack of knowledge about the reward affect his ability to claim it?

I think in contract law, knowledge isn't a requirement for acceptance in a unilateral contract. The idea is that by performing the act (here, providing information leading to arrest and conviction), the person is deemed to have accepted the offer. So even if the detective didn't know about the reward, by providing the information, he might have still accepted the offer.

But wait, the detective didn't know about the reward when he started. So does that mean he didn't intend to accept the offer? Or does the performance itself constitute acceptance regardless of knowledge?

I recall that in some cases, the courts have held that the performance itself, even without knowledge of the offer, can be considered an acceptance. For example, if someone finds a lost item and returns it without knowing there's a reward, they can still claim it because their act constitutes acceptance.

However, there's a nuance here. The detective wasn't aware of the reward offer when he began his investigation. So he didn't have any intent to accept the offer because he didn't know it existed. Does that matter? Or does the law not require intent in unilateral contracts?

Wait, in unilateral contracts, the key is performance, not mutual assent. So the detective's performance (providing the info) might be enough, regardless of his knowledge. But I'm a bit confused because if he didn't know about the offer, he might not have intended to accept it.

Looking at the options, option A says he succeeds because his actions led to the arrest and conviction. That seems to align with the idea that performance is enough. Option C says he doesn't succeed because he didn't have knowledge of the reward. That would suggest that knowledge is a prerequisite, which might not be the case.

Option E says he succeeds because it's a unilateral contract. That also seems plausible because unilateral contracts don't require offer and acceptance in the traditional sense. The offer is made, and performance constitutes acceptance.

But wait, in some jurisdictions, the claimant must have knowledge of the offer to be able to accept it. But I think the general rule is that knowledge isn't required for a unilateral contract. So the detective's performance would suffice.

Another angle: the man published the offer in the newspaper, which is a clear offer to the public. The detective's actions fulfilled the condition of the offer. Therefore, he should be able to claim the reward, even without knowing about it.

So looking at the options, E says he succeeds because it's a unilateral contract. That seems correct. Alternatively, A is also about performance leading to the arrest, which is another way of saying the same thing.

Wait, but the issue is whether he had to know about the reward. If the law doesn't require knowledge, then E is correct. If it does, then C would be correct.

I think the law generally doesn't require knowledge for unilateral contracts. So the detective's performance fulfills the condition, making him entitled to the reward. Therefore, the correct answer would be E.

The detective's actions fulfilled the conditions of the reward offer, which is a unilateral contract. In such contracts, performance constitutes acceptance regardless of the performer's knowledge of the offer. Therefore, the detective is entitled to the reward.

Answer: E
