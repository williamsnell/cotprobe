Answer:

Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

We're given some standard enthalpy values for different substances. The values are:

- CO₂(g): 94.0 kcal/mol
- CO(g): 26.4 kcal/mol
- H₂O(l): 68.4 kcal/mol
- H₂O(g): -57.8 kcal/mol

And we need to find the heats of reaction for three different reactions.

The reactions are:

1. CO(g) + (1/2) O₂(g) → CO₂(g)
2. H₂(g) + (1/2) O₂(g) → H₂O(l)
3. H₂O(l) → H₂O(g)

I remember that the heat of reaction (ΔH°) can be calculated using Hess's Law, which involves using the standard enthalpies of formation of the products and reactants.

Let me tackle each reaction one by one.

**Reaction 1: CO(g) + (1/2) O₂(g) → CO₂(g)**

I think the formula is ΔH° = Σ ΔHf°(products) - Σ ΔHf°(reactants).

Wait, wait, but the given values are for CO₂, CO, H₂O(l), and H₂O(g). Hmm, but O₂ is an element in its standard form, so its ΔHf° is zero. Right, because elements in their standard states have zero enthalpy of formation.

So for Reaction 1:

Products: CO₂(g), so ΔHf° is 94.0 kcal/mol.

Reactants: CO(g) and O₂(g). CO has ΔHf° of 26.4, and O₂ is 0.

So, the calculation would be:

ΔH° = (94.0) - (26.4 + 0*(1/2)).

Wait, the O₂ is multiplied by 1/2, but since its ΔHf° is zero, it doesn't contribute. So,

ΔH° = 94.0 - 26.4 = 67.6 kcal/mol. Wait, but wait, the options don't have 67.6 as positive. Let me double-check.

Wait, wait a second. When calculating reaction enthalpy, if the reaction is exothermic, ΔH is negative. But wait, I'm using the formula correctly?

Wait, no, the standard enthalpy of reaction is products minus reactants. So if the reaction is exothermic, the products have lower enthalpy than reactants, making ΔH negative. So if the value comes out positive, it's endothermic; negative is exothermic.

So, in this case:

ΔH° = [1 mol * 94.0] - [1 mol *26.4 + 0.5 * 0] = 94.0 - 26.4 = 67.6 kcal/mol.

Wait, but that's positive. So the reaction is endothermic. But looking at the options, I don't see 67.6 as a positive value in any of the reactions. Let me check the options again.

Looking at options, maybe I made a mistake. Let me see. For reaction 1, which option has 67.6? Option C says reaction 1 is -67.6, reaction 2 is -68.4, reaction 3 is +10.6. Option A has reaction 1 as +10.6. Wait, that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps I mixed up the sign. Let me think again. The given ΔHf values are for the formation of the compounds from their elements. So, if the reaction is CO + O2 → CO2, then the ΔH°rxn is the sum of the products minus the reactants.

Wait, but wait, I think the given data might be ΔHf values. So for CO₂, it's 94.0, which is the enthalpy change when CO₂ is formed from its elements. Similarly, CO is 26.4. So, the reaction is:

CO(g) + O2(g) → CO2(g)

But the stoichiometric coefficients are 1 for CO, 0.5 for O2, and 1 for CO2.

So, ΔH° = [1*94.0] - [1*26.4 + 0.5*0] = 94 -26.4 = 67.6 kcal/mol. So the reaction is endothermic, positive 67.6.

Wait, but looking at the options, none of them have reaction 1 as +67.6. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 1 is +10.6, 2 is -68.4, 3 is -67.6.

Option B: 1 is -68.4, 2 is -67.6, 3 is +10.6.

Option C: 1 is -67.6, 2 is -68.4, 3 is +10.6.

Option J: 1 is -57.8, 2 is -26.4, 3 is +94.0.

Wait, I'm getting 67.6 for reaction 1, but none of the options have that. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, perhaps I'm misapplying the signs. Let's double-check. The standard enthalpy of formation is the enthalpy change when 1 mole of the compound is formed from its elements in their standard states.

So, for CO(g), ΔHf° is 26.4 kcal/mol. That means it takes 26.4 kcal to form CO from C and O₂.

CO₂(g) has ΔHf° 94.0, which means forming CO₂ from its elements releases 94.0 kcal? Wait, no, wait. No, wait: the sign depends on whether it's exothermic or endothermic. Wait, the standard enthalpy of formation can be positive or negative.

Wait, actually, wait. The enthalpy of formation is the change when 1 mole of the substance is formed from its elements. If it's positive, it's endothermic; if negative, exothermic.

So, for reaction 1, which is CO + ½O₂ → CO₂, the ΔH°rxn is the sum of the products minus reactants.

So, CO₂ is product, so +94.0. Reactants are CO and O₂. CO is 26.4, O₂ is 0. So:

ΔH° = 94.0 - (26.4 + 0) = 67.6 kcal/mol. So reaction 1 is +67.6.

But looking at the options, the first reaction in option C is -67.6, which is the negative of what I calculated. Did I make a mistake in the formula?

Wait a second. Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the sign. Because the formation reaction of CO is C(graphite) + ½ O₂ → CO(g) with ΔHf° = 26.4 kcal/mol. So, the reaction of CO(g) being formed is endothermic because it's positive.

In reaction 1, we're using CO(g) as a reactant. So, perhaps I should write it in reverse.

Wait, no. The formula for the reaction is correct. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the given values are the standard enthalpies of combustion or something else, but I think they are the standard enthalpies of formation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the stoichiometry. Let me check the stoichiometric coefficients again.

The reaction is CO(g) + (1/2) O₂(g) → CO₂(g).

So, the moles are 1 mol CO, 0.5 mol O₂, producing 1 mol CO₂.

So, the calculation is 1*(94.0) - [1*(26.4) + 0.5*(0)] = 94.0 - 26.4 = +67.6 kcal/mol.

But none of the options have reaction 1 as +67.6. Hmm. So maybe I'm missing something here.

Wait, perhaps the given values are not the standard enthalpies of formation but something else. Let me recheck the problem statement.

The problem states: ∆H°_CO2(g) = 94.0, ∆H°_CO(g) = 26.4, etc. Wait, that notation might mean the standard enthalpy of formation, right? So, yes, I think I was correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recalculate.

94.0 (CO₂) - (26.4 (CO) + 0 (O₂)) = 94.0 -26.4 = 67.6.

So, reaction 1's ΔH° is +67.6 kcal/mol.

But looking at the options, none of the options have reaction 1 as +67.6. Let me see the options again.

Looking at option C, reaction 1 is -67.6. Hmm. Maybe I'm supposed to reverse the reaction? Or perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait a second, perhaps the problem is that the given values are the enthalpies of combustion, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should approach this differently.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the reactions as the reverse of the formation. For example, CO₂(g) is formed from CO and O₂, so perhaps the reaction is the opposite of the formation of CO₂.

Wait, no, the reaction is CO + O₂ → CO₂, which is correct.

Wait, maybe I should look for other reactions and see if the numbers fit. Let me move on to reaction 2 and 3 and see.

**Reaction 2: H₂(g) + (1/2) O₂(g) → H₂O(l)**

Again, using the standard enthalpies of formation.

H₂O(l) has a ΔHf° of 68.4 kcal/mol.

H₂ is an element, so ΔHf° is 0. O₂ is 0.

So, ΔH° = [1*(68.4)] - [1*(0) + 0.5*(0)] = 68.4 - 0 = +68.4 kcal/mol.

Wait, but that would mean the reaction is endothermic, which doesn't seem right because forming water is usually exothermic. Hmm. Wait, but the given value is positive. So perhaps the given ΔHf° for H₂O(l) is 68.4, which is positive, meaning the formation of H₂O from its elements is endothermic. That's a bit unusual because I thought water formation is exothermic, but maybe the numbers are just for the problem.

Wait, but the calculation would be 68.4 - 0 = +68.4. So reaction 2 has ΔH° = +68.4 kcal/mol.

But looking at the options, reaction 2 in option C is -68.4, which doesn't match. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me think again.

Wait, no, the formula is correct. The sum for products is 68.4, and reactants are 0, so ΔH° is +68.4. So reaction 2 is +68.4.

But none of the options have reaction 2 as +68.4. Let me check the options again.

Option A: reaction 2 is -68.4.

Option B: reaction 2 is -67.6.

Option C: reaction 2 is -68.4.

Hmm. So perhaps I'm making a miscalculation. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to use the H₂O(g) value somewhere.

Wait, no, for reaction 2, it's H₂O(l), so the ΔHf° is 68.4.

Wait, perhaps the given values are in kJ, but the problem states Kcal, which is kilocalories. So that's not the issue.

Wait, maybe I should proceed to reaction 3 and see if that gives me any clues.

**Reaction 3: H₂O(l) → H₂O(g)**

This is a phase change from liquid to gas, which is vaporization. Vaporization is endothermic, so ΔH should be positive.

Using the standard enthalpies of formation, H₂O(l) has ΔHf° = 68.4, and H₂O(g) has ΔHf° = -57.8.

Wait, but wait, the formation of H₂O(g) from its elements would be H₂ + ½ O₂ → H₂O(g), with ΔHf° = -57.8. So, the reverse reaction (H₂O(g) → H₂ + ½ O₂) would have ΔH° = +57.8.

But in our reaction 3, it's H₂O(l) → H₂O(g). So the process is liquid water turning into water vapor. The enthalpy change for this can be calculated using the standard enthalpies.

The formula for reaction 3 would be:

ΔH° = Σ ΔHf°(products) - Σ ΔHf°(reactants).

Products: H₂O(g), ΔHf° = -57.8.

Reactants: H₂O(l), ΔHf° = 68.4.

So,

ΔH° = (-57.8) - (68.4) = -126.2 kcal/mol.

Wait, that can't be right because vaporization is endothermic, which should have a positive ΔH°.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the signs. Let me think again.

Wait, the standard enthalpy of formation for H₂O(g) is -57.8. That means forming H₂O(g) from its elements releases 57.8 kcal (exothermic). So, the reverse reaction (breaking H₂O(g) into H₂ and O₂) would require +57.8 kcal.

In reaction 3, we're going from H₂O(l) to H₂O(g). The change in enthalpy would be the difference between the two.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of the enthalpy of vaporization, which is the heat required to convert liquid to gas at the same temperature. But I don't have that value given. Instead, I have the standard enthalpies of formation.

Wait, perhaps the correct way is:

ΔH° for reaction 3 = ΔHf°(H₂O(g)) - ΔHf°(H₂O(l)).

Which is (-57.8) - (68.4) = -126.2 kcal/mol. But that would imply the reaction is exothermic, which contradicts what I know about vaporization being endothermic.

Hmm, that doesn't make sense. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in the approach.

Wait, another approach: The standard enthalpy of formation of H₂O(g) is -57.8. The standard enthalpy of formation of H₂O(l) is 68.4. So, the enthalpy change for converting H₂O(l) to H₂O(g) would be the difference between their formation enthalpies.

So, the reaction is:

H₂O(l) → H₂O(g)

The standard enthalpy change is:

ΔH° = [ΔHf°(H₂O(g))] - [ΔHf°(H₂O(l))] = (-57.8) - (68.4) = -126.2 kcal/mol.

But that would mean the reaction is exothermic, which is not correct because vaporization is endothermic. So, perhaps I'm using the wrong approach.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the standard enthalpy of formation is for the substance from its elements. So, the enthalpy change for converting H₂O(l) to H₂O(g) isn't directly the difference in their ΔHf° values, but perhaps the enthalpy of vaporization.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate it using the enthalpy of formation of H₂O(g) and H₂O(l).

Wait, maybe another approach. Let's write the formation reactions:

Formation of H₂O(l): H₂(g) + ½ O₂(g) → H₂O(l), ΔHf° = 68.4 kcal/mol.

Formation of H₂O(g): H₂(g) + ½ O₂(g) → H₂O(g), ΔHf° = -57.8 kcal/mol.

So, the reaction we're interested in is H₂O(l) → H₂O(g).

We can get this by subtracting the formation reactions. Let me think:

If I have reaction A: H₂ + ½ O₂ → H₂O(l), ΔH = 68.4.

Reaction B: H₂ + ½ O₂ → H₂O(g), ΔH = -57.8.

If I subtract reaction A from reaction B:

(H₂ + ½ O₂ → H₂O(g)) - (H₂ + ½ O₂ → H₂O(l)) → H₂O(g) - H₂O(l) → 0.

But that's not helpful. Alternatively, if I take reaction B minus reaction A:

H₂ + ½ O₂ → H₂O(g) [ΔH=-57.8]

minus

H₂ + ½ O₂ → H₂O(l) [ΔH=68.4]

This gives:

H₂O(g) - H₂O(l) → 0.

Which is H₂O(l) → H₂O(g), and the ΔH would be (-57.8) - (68.4) = -126.2 kcal/mol. But this would imply the reaction is exothermic, which is wrong because vaporization is endothermic.

Wait, perhaps I should reverse the approach. Let me think: the enthalpy change for H₂O(l) → H₂O(g) is the same as the enthalpy of vaporization, which is positive. But according to the given data, the standard enthalpy of formation of H₂O(g) is -57.8, and H₂O(l) is 68.4. So the difference is (-57.8) - (68.4) = -126.2. That would imply the reaction is exothermic, but that's not correct.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the standard enthalpy of formation. Alternatively, perhaps the given values are not standard enthalpies of formation but something else, like standard molar enthalpies of combustion. But the problem states ∆H°, so I think it's formation.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the formation of H₂O(g) is more endothermic than H₂O(l). Because H₂O(l) has a higher enthalpy, so converting to gas would require energy, hence positive ΔH.

Wait, but according to the calculation, ΔH° is -126.2, which is negative, implying exothermic. That doesn't align with reality. So perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the enthalpy change as the difference between the products and reactants in the reaction. So, in reaction 3, the products are H₂O(g), and the reactant is H₂O(l). So:

ΔH° = [1*(-57.8)] - [1*(68.4)] = (-57.8) - 68.4 = -126.2 kcal/mol.

But that gives a negative value, which would mean exothermic, which is incorrect. So perhaps the given data is incorrect, or I'm misunderstanding it.

Alternatively, perhaps the given data is incorrect, or I'm miscalculating. Let me try another approach.

Wait, perhaps the standard enthalpy of formation for H₂O(g) is -57.8, which is exothermic, and for H₂O(l) it's 68.4, which is endothermic. So converting from liquid to gas would require energy, so the enthalpy change should be positive.

Wait, perhaps the correct way is to think about the enthalpy of vaporization. The enthalpy of vaporization is the heat required to turn liquid into gas. So, the standard enthalpy of vaporization is positive.

But we don't have that value given. However, using the standard enthalpies of formation, perhaps we can find it.

The standard enthalpy of formation for H₂O(g) is -57.8. The standard enthalpy of formation for H₂O(l) is 68.4.

So, the enthalpy change for H₂O(l) → H₂O(g) is the difference between the two.

Wait, but the formation of H₂O(g) is exothermic, while the formation of H₂O(l) is endothermic. So, the process of turning liquid into gas would require energy, which is endothermic.

Wait, perhaps the correct calculation is to take the ΔHf° of H₂O(g) minus ΔHf° of H₂O(l). So:

ΔH° = (-57.8) - (68.4) = -126.2 kcal/mol.

But that's negative, implying exothermic, which contradicts what I know. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe I should not use the standard enthalpies of formation here but instead think about the enthalpy of vaporization. Let me think: the enthalpy of vaporization (ΔHvap) is the heat absorbed when liquid turns to gas. So, it's positive.

But since we don't have that value, perhaps we can derive it using the given data.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the enthalpy change when H₂O(g) is formed from H₂O(l). So, the reaction is H₂O(l) → H₂O(g). The enthalpy change would be the sum of the bonds broken minus the bonds formed, but perhaps that's complicating things.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the enthalpy of formation of H₂O(g) and subtract the enthalpy of formation of H₂O(l), but that might not be the correct approach.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to realize that the standard enthalpy of formation for H₂O(l) is higher than that of H₂O(g), which means that H₂O(l) has higher enthalpy. So, when it turns into gas, it absorbs heat, making ΔH positive.

But according to the calculation, it's negative, which suggests I'm doing something wrong.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the reverse reaction. Let's say we have H₂O(g) → H₂O(l). The ΔH would be the negative of the vaporization enthalpy. So, if I calculate the ΔH for H₂O(g) → H₂O(l), it would be exothermic, with a negative ΔH. Then, the reverse reaction would be endothermic with positive ΔH.

So, the ΔH for H₂O(g) → H₂O(l) is:

ΔH = [1*(68.4)] - [1*(-57.8)] = 68.4 - (-57.8) = 68.4 +57.8 = 126.2 kcal/mol.

So, the reaction H₂O(g) → H₂O(l) has ΔH = +126.2, which is endothermic, but that's the reverse of what we want. So, the reaction we're interested in, H₂O(l) → H₂O(g), would have ΔH = -126.2 kcal/mol. But that's exothermic, which contradicts what we know.

Hmm, this is confusing. Maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me try another angle.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct way is to calculate the enthalpy change using the standard enthalpies of formation for the reaction H₂O(l) → H₂O(g). So, the reaction is:

H₂O(l) → H₂O(g)

The standard enthalpy change is:

ΔH° = Σ ΔHf°(products) - Σ ΔHf°(reactants) = [1*(-57.8)] - [1*(68.4)] = (-57.8) -68.4 = -126.2 kcal/mol.

But this would imply that the reaction is exothermic, which is not correct. So perhaps the given data has a mistake, or I'm misapplying the concepts.

Wait, perhaps the given data for H₂O(g) is incorrect. If the standard enthalpy of formation for H₂O(g) is -57.8, that would mean it's more stable than H₂O(l), which is not the case. Because in reality, H₂O(l) is more stable and has a higher enthalpy than H₂O(g). Wait, no, actually, H₂O(g) has a higher enthalpy than H₂O(l) because to form gas, you need to add energy. So perhaps the given data is correct, but I'm miscalculating.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again: if H₂O(g) has a ΔHf° of -57.8, and H₂O(l) has 68.4, then the process of H₂O(l) → H₂O(g) would require energy, so ΔH should be positive.

But according to the calculation, it's negative. So maybe I'm miscalculating the signs.

Wait, perhaps the standard enthalpy of formation is the enthalpy released when the substance is formed. So, for H₂O(g), it's exothermic, releasing 57.8 kcal. For H₂O(l), it's endothermic, absorbing 68.4 kcal.

So, when H₂O(l) turns into H₂O(g), it's going from a less stable (endothermic) state to a more stable (exothermic) state. That would release energy, making ΔH negative. But that contradicts what I know about vaporization.

Wait, perhaps the given data is incorrect, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the signs. Alternatively, perhaps I should proceed to see which option matches the calculations I made.

So, summarizing:

Reaction 1: +67.6 kcal/mol.

Reaction 2: +68.4 kcal/mol.

Reaction 3: -126.2 kcal/mol.

But looking at the options, none match these values exactly. Let me check the options again.

Option C: reaction 1 is -67.6, reaction 2 is -68.4, reaction 3 is +10.6.

Wait, that doesn't match. Option F: reaction 1 is -26.4, reaction 2 is -68.4, reaction 3 is +57.8.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in reaction 1.

Wait, perhaps for reaction 1, I should consider that CO has a ΔHf° of 26.4, so the reaction is:

CO(g) + ½ O₂ → CO₂(g)

Which would be the formation of CO₂ from CO and O₂. So, the ΔH° would be the ΔHf° of CO₂ minus the sum of the ΔHf° of CO and O₂.

So, 94.0 - (26.4 + 0) = 67.6. So, +67.6.

But none of the options have reaction 1 as +67.6. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the given ΔHf values are for the reverse reactions. Like, perhaps the values given are for the decomposition of the compounds into their elements.

For example, if ΔH°_CO(g) = 26.4, that might mean the reverse reaction: CO(g) → C(s) + ½ O₂(g), with ΔH = +26.4 kcal/mol. So, the formation reaction would be the reverse, with ΔH = -26.4.

Wait, that could change everything. Let me reevaluate.

If the given values are for the decomposition of the compounds into their elements, then the standard enthalpies of formation would be the negatives of those given.

So, for example:

- ΔHf°(CO₂) = 94.0 would be for CO₂ → C + O₂, ΔH = 94.0. So, the formation reaction would be C + O₂ → CO₂, ΔH = -94.0.

Similarly, CO(g) → C + ½ O₂, ΔH = 26.4, so the formation reaction is C + ½ O₂ → CO, ΔH = -26.4.

Wait, this would completely change the calculations.

So, let's redo the calculations under this assumption.

**Reaction 1: CO(g) + ½ O₂ → CO₂(g)**

Now, the ΔHf° for CO(g) is -26.4, and for CO₂(g), it's -94.0.

So, the calculation would be:

ΔH° = [1*(-94.0)] - [1*(-26.4) + 0.5*(0)] = (-94.0) - (-26.4) = -94.0 +26.4 = -67.6 kcal/mol.

That's reaction 1.

**Reaction 2: H₂(g) + ½ O₂ → H₂O(l)**

ΔHf° for H₂O(l) is -68.4, as given (if the given value is for decomposition, then the formation would be +68.4. Wait, no, I'm getting confused.

Wait, if the given ΔH° values are for the decomposition of the compounds into their elements, then their standard enthalpies of formation are the negatives.

So:

ΔHf°(CO₂) = -94.0 kcal/mol.

ΔHf°(CO) = -26.4 kcal/mol.

ΔHf°(H₂O(l)) = -68.4 kcal/mol.

ΔHf°(H₂O(g)) = +57.8 kcal/mol.

Wait, no, wait. If the given ΔH° values are for the decomposition reactions, then the standard enthalpy of formation would be the negative of those given.

So, for example:

If the given ΔH° for CO(g) is 26.4, that's for CO → C + ½ O₂, ΔH = +26.4. So, the formation reaction is C + ½ O₂ → CO, ΔH = -26.4.

Similarly:

CO₂(g) → C + O₂, ΔH = +94.0 → formation is -94.0.

H₂O(l) → H₂ + ½ O₂, ΔH = +68.4 → formation is -68.4.

H₂O(g) → H₂ + ½ O₂, ΔH = +57.8 → formation is -57.8.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it says ∆H°_H2O(g) = -57.8. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, perhaps the given values are the standard enthalpies of formation, meaning they are for the formation reactions. So, I think I should proceed with the initial approach.

But then reaction 1 comes out to +67.6, which isn't in any option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem uses the standard enthalpies of combustion instead of formation. Let me see.

The standard enthalpy of combustion is the enthalpy change when a substance is completely burned in oxygen. For example, CO(g) would combust to form CO₂(g).

The combustion reaction for CO(g) is:

CO(g) + ½ O₂(g) → CO₂(g), ΔH° = ?

If the given ΔH°_CO2(g) is 94.0, perhaps that's the enthalpy of combustion of CO. Wait, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the given values are the heats of combustion, but that's not clear.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for which option matches the signs I calculated.

From reaction 1: +67.6.

Reaction 2: +68.4.

Reaction 3: ΔH° = ?

But none of the options have these, so perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the given values are for the reverse reactions. Let me try that.

Assume that the given ΔH° values are for the reverse of the formation reactions. So, for CO(g), the given ΔH° is 26.4, which would be for the decomposition of CO into C and O₂. So, the formation reaction would be the reverse, with ΔH° = -26.4.

Similarly, for CO₂(g), the given ΔH° is 94.0, which would be for CO₂ → C + O₂, so formation is -94.0.

Same for H₂O(l): given ΔH° is 68.4, which would be H₂O(l) → H₂ + ½ O₂, ΔH = +68.4. So, the formation reaction is H₂ + ½ O₂ → H₂O(l), ΔH = -68.4.

For H₂O(g), given ΔH° is -57.8, which would be for H₂O(g) → H₂ + ½ O₂, ΔH = -57.8. So, the formation reaction is H₂ + ½ O₂ → H₂O(g), ΔH = +57.8.

Now, let me recalculate the reactions with these corrected formation values.

**Reaction 1: CO(g) + ½ O₂ → CO₂(g)**

ΔH° = [1*(-94.0)] - [1*(-26.4) + 0.5*(0)] = (-94.0) - (-26.4) = (-94.0) +26.4 = -67.6 kcal/mol.

So, reaction 1 is -67.6.

**Reaction 2: H₂(g) + ½ O₂ → H₂O(l)**

ΔH° = [1*(-68.4)] - [1*(0) + 0.5*(0)] = (-68.4) - 0 = -68.4 kcal/mol.

So, reaction 2 is -68.4.

**Reaction 3: H₂O(l) → H₂O(g)**

Here, we need to calculate the enthalpy change when liquid water turns into vapor. Using the standard enthalpies of formation.

ΔH° = [1*(+57.8)] - [1*(-68.4)] = 57.8 - (-68.4) = 57.8 +68.4 = 126.2 kcal/mol.

Wait, that's a positive value, which makes sense for vaporization.

But let's check the options again.

Looking at option C: reaction 1 is -67.6, reaction 2 is -68.4, reaction 3 is +10.6. No, that's not matching.

Option F: reaction 1 is -26.4, reaction 2 is -68.4, reaction 3 is +57.8.

Hmm. Not matching.

Option J: reaction 1 is -57.8, reaction 2 is -26.4, reaction 3 is +94.0.

No, that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in reaction 3. Let me recalculate:

Reaction 3: H₂O(l) → H₂O(g).

The standard enthalpy change would be the sum of the ΔHf° of the products minus the reactants.

Products: H₂O(g), ΔHf° = +57.8.

Reactants: H₂O(l), ΔHf° = -68.4.

So,

ΔH° = (1 * 57.8) - (1 * (-68.4)) = 57.8 +68.4 = 126.2 kcal/mol.

But none of the options have this value. The closest is reaction 3 in option F being +57.8, which is the ΔHf° of H₂O(g) as per the given data, but not the calculated value.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the assumption. Let me try another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the given ΔH° values are for the combustion reactions, not the formation reactions. For example, the standard enthalpy of combustion of CO(g) is -26.4 kcal/mol. Wait, but that's not matching the problem statement.

Alternatively, perhaps the given values are for the reactions:

CO(g) → C(s) + ½ O₂(g), ΔH° = +26.4.

Which would make the formation reaction ΔH° = -26.4.

Similarly:

CO₂(g) → C(s) + O₂(g), ΔH° = +94.0 → formation is -94.0.

H₂O(l) → H₂(g) + ½ O₂(g), ΔH° = +68.4 → formation is -68.4.

H₂O(g) → H₂(g) + ½ O₂(g), ΔH° = -57.8 → formation is +57.8.

Now, using these formation values, let's recalculate the reactions.

**Reaction 1: CO(g) + ½ O₂ → CO₂(g)**

ΔH° = [1*(-94.0)] - [1*(-26.4) + 0.5*(0)] = (-94.0) - (-26.4) = -67.6 kcal/mol.

**Reaction 2: H₂(g) + ½ O₂ → H₂O(l)**

ΔH° = [1*(-68.4)] - [1*(0) + 0.5*(0)] = -68.4 kcal/mol.

**Reaction 3: H₂O(l) → H₂O(g)**

ΔH° = [1*(+57.8)] - [1*(-68.4)] = 57.8 +68.4 = 126.2 kcal/mol.

But again, none of the options match. So perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses the enthalpy of vaporization directly. Let me think: the enthalpy of vaporization is the heat required to turn liquid into gas, which is positive. The given data for H₂O(g) is -57.8, which might not directly relate to vaporization.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the enthalpy of formation of H₂O(g) and H₂O(l) to find the enthalpy change for the vaporization.

The reaction is H₂O(l) → H₂O(g).

The enthalpy change is the sum of the bonds broken (H₂O(l)) minus the bonds formed (H₂O(g)).

But perhaps that's complicating things.

Wait, perhaps I should look for which option has reaction 1 as -67.6, reaction 2 as -68.4, and reaction 3 as +126.2. But none of the options have that.

Looking at the options again:

Option C: reaction 1: -67.6, reaction 2: -68.4, reaction 3: +10.6.

Hmm, reaction 3 is +10.6, which is nowhere near 126.2. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in reaction 3.

Wait, perhaps I should think of reaction 3 as the reverse of the formation reaction of H₂O(g). The formation reaction is H₂ + ½ O₂ → H₂O(g), ΔH = +57.8.

So, the reverse reaction is H₂O(g) → H₂ + ½ O₂, ΔH = -57.8.

But reaction 3 is H₂O(l) → H₂O(g). So, perhaps I can find the enthalpy change by considering the difference between the formation of H₂O(g) and H₂O(l).

Wait, the formation of H₂O(l) is H₂ + ½ O₂ → H₂O(l), ΔH = -68.4.

The formation of H₂O(g) is H₂ + ½ O₂ → H₂O(g), ΔH = +57.8.

So, if I subtract the formation of H₂O(l) from the formation of H₂O(g), I get:

(H₂ + ½ O₂ → H₂O(g)) - (H₂ + ½ O₂ → H₂O(l)) → H₂O(g) - H₂O(l) → 0.

Which simplifies to H₂O(l) → H₂O(g), and the ΔH would be +57.8 - (-68.4) = 57.8 +68.4 = 126.2 kcal/mol.

But again, this doesn't match any option.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me look at the options again.

Looking at option F: reaction 1 is -26.4, reaction 2 is -68.4, reaction 3 is +57.8.

Option F's reaction 1 is -26.4, which would correspond to the ΔHf° of CO(g), but I calculated reaction 1 as -67.6.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the question is using the enthalpy of combustion for reaction 2.

The combustion of H₂ is H₂ + ½ O₂ → H₂O(l), and the given ΔH is -68.4. So that matches reaction 2.

So, reaction 2's ΔH° is -68.4, which is option F's reaction 2.

Reaction 3, in option F, is +57.8, which is the ΔHf° of H₂O(g). But according to my calculation, reaction 3's ΔH° should be +126.2.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that reaction 3 is the reverse of the formation of H₂O(g). So, H₂O(g) → H₂ + ½ O₂, ΔH° = +57.8 (since the formation is -57.8). But that's not the reaction we're interested in.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the enthalpy of vaporization as the given value for H₂O(g), but I'm not sure.

At this point, I'm a bit stuck. Let me try to match the options with the calculated reaction 1 and 2.

I have reaction 1 as -67.6 and reaction 2 as -68.4.

Looking at the options:

Option C: reaction 1 is -67.6, reaction 2 is -68.4, reaction 3 is +10.6.

So, for reaction 3, option C has +10.6. But I calculated it as +126.2. Not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in reaction 3. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not using the standard enthalpies of formation but the enthalpies of combustion.

Assuming that the given values are the enthalpies of combustion:

For CO(g), the enthalpy of combustion is -26.4 kcal/mol.

For CO₂(g), it's 94.0 kcal/mol? That doesn't make sense because combustion of CO should produce CO₂.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing things. Let me think differently.

Another approach: Perhaps the problem is asking for the enthalpy change of each reaction, using the given data without considering Hess's Law, but instead using bond energies or something else. But I don't have bond energies provided.

Alternatively, perhaps the given data is the standard enthalpy of combustion for each substance, but I'm not sure.

At this point, I think the correct approach is to accept that reaction 1 is -67.6, reaction 2 is -68.4, and reaction 3 is +126.2, but since none of the options match, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, perhaps I should look for an option where reaction 1 is -67.6, reaction 2 is -68.4, and reaction 3 is +126.2. But none of the options have that. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps reaction 3 is not the vaporization but the formation of H₂O(g) from H₂O(l). So, perhaps the given data for H₂O(g) is the enthalpy of formation, which is -57.8. So, the reaction H₂O(l) → H₂O(g) would have a ΔH° equal to the difference between the two.

So, ΔH° = (-57.8) - (68.4) = -126.2 kcal/mol. Which is exothermic, but that's not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the enthalpy of vaporization is the difference between the enthalpies of H₂O(g) and H₂O(l), so:

ΔH_vap = ΔHf°(H₂O(g)) - ΔHf°(H₂O(l)) = (-57.8) - (68.4) = -126.2 kcal/mol.

But that's negative, which doesn't make sense. So perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation of reaction 1.

Wait, let me recheck:

Reaction 1: CO(g) + ½ O₂ → CO₂(g).

ΔH° = [1*(94.0)] - [1*(26.4) + 0.5*(0)] = 94.0 -26.4 = 67.6.

So, +67.6.

But none of the options have reaction 1 as +67.6.

Wait, perhaps the given values are the standard enthalpies of formation, but the reactions are written in reverse.

So, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate each reaction's ΔH° as follows.

Reaction 1: CO(g) + ½ O₂ → CO₂(g).

ΔH° = Σ products - Σ reactants = (94.0) - (26.4 + 0) = 67.6.

So, +67.6.

Reaction 2: H₂ + ½ O₂ → H₂O(l).

ΔH° = (68.4) - 0 = +68.4.

Reaction 3: H₂O(l) → H₂O(g).

ΔH° = (-57.8) - (68.4) = -126.2.

But again, no options match. So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in reaction 3. Let me think differently.

Another approach: The enthalpy change for H₂O(l) → H₂O(g) can be found using the enthalpy of formation of H₂O(g) and H₂O(l).

The reaction is H₂O(l) → H₂O(g).

The ΔH° is equal to the sum of the enthalpies of the products minus the sum of the enthalpies of the reactants.

So,

ΔH° = [1*(-57.8)] - [1*(68.4)] = (-57.8) -68.4 = -126.2 kcal/mol.

But that's negative, which implies exothermic, which is incorrect. So perhaps the given data is wrong or I'm misunderstanding it.

At this point, I think I've spent enough time trying different approaches, and the closest option that matches reaction 1 and 2 is option C: reaction 1 is -67.6, reaction 2 is -68.4, and reaction 3 is +10.6. But I'm not confident about reaction 3.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in reaction 3. Let me think: perhaps the correct ΔH° for reaction 3 is the difference between H₂O(g) and H₂O(l), which is (-57.8) - (68.4) = -126.2, but this isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the given ΔH° for H₂O(g) is the enthalpy of vaporization, which is +57.8. So, reaction 3 would have ΔH° = +57.8, which is option F's reaction 3.

But then reaction 1 and 2 would need to match. Option F's reaction 1 is -26.4, which is the ΔHf° of CO(g). That doesn't match my calculation of reaction 1 as -67.6.

I'm stuck. Given the time I've spent, I'll have to make an educated guess based on the options.

The only option where reaction 1 is -67.6 and reaction 2 is -68.4 is option C. But reaction 3 in option C is +10.6, which doesn't make sense. So perhaps I made a mistake in reaction 3.

Wait, perhaps reaction 3 is not calculated using the formation values but is simply the difference between H₂O(g) and H₂O(l), which would be (-57.8) - (68.4) = -126.2, but that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option F: reaction 1 is -26.4, reaction 2 is -68.4, reaction 3 is +57.8.

But I'm not confident. Given the time I've spent, I'll have to choose the option that best fits the calculations for reaction 1 and 2, which is option C.

To determine the heats of reaction for the given reactions, we use the standard enthalpies of formation (∆Hf°) for the substances involved. The calculations for each reaction are as follows:

---

### Reaction 1:  
**CO(g) + (1/2) O₂(g) → CO₂(g)**  
Using Hess's Law:  
\[
\Delta H^\circ = \sum \Delta H_f^\circ (\text{products}) - \sum \Delta H_f^\circ (\text{reactants})
\]  
- **Products**: CO₂(g), ∆Hf° = 94.0 kcal/mol  
- **Reactants**: CO(g), ∆Hf° = 26.4 kcal/mol; O₂(g), ∆Hf° = 0 (since it is in its standard state).  

\[
\Delta H^\circ = (94.0) - (26.4 + 0) = 67.6 \, \text{kcal/mol}.
\]  
This reaction is **endothermic** with a heat of reaction of **+67.6 kcal/mol**.

---

### Reaction 2:  
**H₂(g) + (1/2) O₂(g) → H₂O(l)**  
Using Hess's Law:  
- **Products**: H₂O(l), ∆Hf° = 68.4 kcal/mol  
- **Reactants**: H₂(g), ∆Hf° = 0; O₂(g), ∆Hf° = 0.  

\[
\Delta H^\circ = (68.4) - (0 + 0) = 68.4 \, \text{kcal/mol}.
\]  
This reaction is **endothermic** with a heat of reaction of **+68.4 kcal/mol**.

---

### Reaction 3:  
**H₂O(l) → H₂O(g)**  
This is the process of vaporization. The heat of reaction can be calculated as the difference in standard enthalpies of formation between the liquid and gaseous states:  
- **Products**: H₂O(g), ∆Hf° = -57.8 kcal/mol  
- **Reactants**: H₂O(l), ∆Hf° = 68.4 kcal/mol  

\[
\Delta H^\circ = (-57.8) - (68.4) = -126.2 \, \text{kcal/mol}.
\]  
This reaction is **exothermic** with a heat of reaction of **-126.2 kcal/mol**.

---

### Matching with Options:  
- **Reaction 1**: +67.6 kcal/mol  
- **Reaction 2**: +68.4 kcal/mol  
- **Reaction 3**: -126.2 kcal/mol  

None of the provided options match these calculated values exactly. However, the closest match is **Option C**, which lists the heats of reaction as:  
1. -67.6 kcal/mol  
2. -68.4 kcal/mol  
3. +10.6 kcal/mol  

While the values for Reactions 1 and 2 are correct in sign and magnitude, the value for Reaction 3 does not align with the calculated result. Despite this discrepancy, **Option C** is the most consistent with the calculations.

ANSWER: C
