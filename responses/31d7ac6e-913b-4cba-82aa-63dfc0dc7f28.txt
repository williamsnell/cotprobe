Question:

Toxicity and dose-response data from animal studies, together with data of which of the following types, are used to evaluate the safety of a food substance?


Options:

A: The price of the food to which the substance is added
B: The concentration of the substance in food
C: The amount of the substance that is excreted by the human body
D: The amount of the substance that is naturally present in the human body
E: The quantity of the substance sold in supermarkets
F: The yearly intake of the substance by animals consuming the food
G: The daily intake of the substance by humans consuming the food
H: The total amount of the substance a person will consume over a lifetime

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about evaluating the safety of a food substance. The question is asking which type of data, besides toxicity and dose-response data from animal studies, is used for this evaluation. Let me break it down.

First, I need to understand what the question is really about. It's related to food safety assessment. From what I remember, when evaluating the safety of something added to food, you look at how much of it people are likely to consume and whether that amount is safe based on animal studies.

The options given are A through J, but in the list provided, it's A to H. Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: The price of the food to which the substance is added. Hmm, price doesn't directly relate to safety. It might affect how much people buy, but it's not about the quantity consumed or toxicity. So probably not A.

Option B: The concentration of the substance in food. Concentration is important because it tells you how much is present in the food per serving. But I think they also need to know how much a person consumes, not just the concentration. So maybe B is part of it, but maybe not the complete answer.

Option C: The amount of the substance that is excreted by the human body. Excretion data is more about how the body processes the substance, but I'm not sure if that's directly used in evaluating safety alongside animal studies. It might be more related to pharmacokinetics rather than intake assessment.

Option D: The amount of the substance that is naturally present in the human body. That sounds more like baseline levels, maybe for things like hormones or vitamins. But if it's a food additive, this might not be relevant unless it's a nutrient. Not sure, but probably not the main factor here.

Option E: The quantity of the substance sold in supermarkets. Sales data tells you how much is available but not necessarily how much each person consumes. It's a measure of availability, not intake. So E might not be the right choice.

Option F: The yearly intake of the substance by animals consuming the food. Wait, the question is about human safety, so data from animals is already part of the toxicity studies. But F is about animals' intake, which might not directly translate to human intake. Or maybe it's about using animal consumption data to estimate human exposure? Not sure. I'm leaning towards F not being the answer because the question is about human evaluation.

Option G: The daily intake of the substance by humans consuming the food. This makes sense because to evaluate safety, you need to know how much humans are ingesting daily. Combining this with animal study data (toxicity and dose-response) allows you to determine if the human intake level is safe.

Option H: The total amount of the substance a person will consume over a lifetime. This is more about long-term exposure. While lifetime intake is important in some risk assessments, the question seems to be about the data used in evaluation, which is typically based on typical daily consumption. So H might be more about cumulative risk, but I'm not certain.

So, thinking about it, when assessing the safety of a food additive, regulatory agencies like the FDA look at the acceptable daily intake (ADI). This is calculated by determining the amount that, when consumed daily, doesn't cause harm. So they use data from animal studies (toxicity, LD50, NOAEL) and combine it with human intake dataâ€”how much people are likely to eat daily.

Therefore, the correct answer would be G: The daily intake of the substance by humans consuming the food.

The evaluation of the safety of a food substance involves combining toxicity and dose-response data from animal studies with information on human intake. Specifically, knowing the daily intake allows for assessing whether the consumed amount is safe based on the animal study findings. 

Answer: G
