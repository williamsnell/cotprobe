Okay, so I have this question about the Dalai Lama's title and what it means. The options are from A to J, and I need to figure out which one is correct. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that the Dalai Lama is a religious leader, specifically the head of the Gelug school of Tibetan Buddhism. His title is in Tibetan, so I should consider the Tibetan meaning of "Dalai Lama."

The term "Dalai" is part of his title. I think it means "ocean" in Tibetan. Then "Lama" is a common term meaning "guru" or "teacher." So putting it together, "Dalai Lama" would translate to something like "Ocean of Wisdom" or "Ocean of Knowledge."

Looking at the options, let's go through them one by one. Option A is "Love of the Ocean" â€“ that doesn't seem right because "Dalai" isn't about love. Option B is "Lover of Wisdom," which is close but not exactly matching the structure. Option C is "Wisdom of the Ocean," which sounds like it could be a possible translation, but I'm not sure if it's the correct phrasing. Option D is "Ocean of Stillness," which doesn't fit because "stillness" isn't part of the title. Option E is "Stillness of Wisdom," which also doesn't match. Option F is "Ocean of Love," again, love isn't part of the meaning. Option G is "Wisdom of Love," which is the reverse of what I think. Option H is "Ocean of Wisdom," which sounds exactly like what I was thinking. Option I is "Stillness of Love," which doesn't fit at all. Option J is "Lover of the Ocean," which is the opposite of the actual meaning.

So, "Dalai Lama" translates to "Ocean of Wisdom," which is option H. I'm pretty confident that's correct because I've heard it explained that way before. The term emphasizes wisdom and knowledge, likening it to an ocean, which is vast and deep.

The Dalai Lama's title combines "Dalai," meaning "ocean," and "Lama," meaning "teacher" or "guru." Together, it translates to "Ocean of Wisdom," making the correct answer H.

Answer: H
