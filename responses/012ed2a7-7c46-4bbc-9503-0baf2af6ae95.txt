Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about Anscombe criticizing Butler. I remember that both are philosophers, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I need to recall who Anscombe and Butler are. Anscombe is a twentieth-century philosopher known for her work in ethics, particularly her critique of consequentialism and her defense of virtue ethics. Butler, on the other hand, was an eighteenth-century philosopher who wrote about ethics, religion, and human nature. He's known for his sermons and his arguments against atheism.

The question is asking what grounds Anscombe used to criticize Butler. The options are A to J, each presenting a different philosophical point.

I think Butler's ethics were based on conscience and the idea that humans have a rational nature. He talked about the "principle of utility" but in a different way than later utilitarians. He also discussed the idea of self-legislation, where humans create moral laws for themselves.

Anscombe, being a critic, likely found some flaw in Butler's arguments. One thing I remember is that Anscombe was critical of the idea that we can derive 'ought' statements from 'is' statements. That's from Hume's famous statement that you can't derive an 'ought' from an 'is.' But I'm not sure if that's the point here because the options don't directly mention Hume.

Looking at the options, option G says "we can't really derive an 'ought' from an 'is.'" I think this is related to Anscombe's critique, but I'm not entirely sure if she was specifically criticizing Butler on this point.

Another angle is Butler's concept of conscience. Anscombe might have argued that relying on conscience as a guide to morality is problematic because it's fallible. That would correspond to option F: "our consciences are fallible." I think she did talk about the unreliability of conscience, arguing that it's not a sufficient basis for morality because it can be mistaken.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Anscombe's main critique against Butler might be more about his view of human nature and the basis of morality. Butler believed in the principle of utility but in a way that was tied to self-interest and the pursuit of happiness. Anscombe, being a virtue ethicist, might have disagreed with his foundation of ethics.

Alternatively, I remember that Anscombe wrote a piece called "Modern Moral Philosophy" where she criticized the then-dominant ethical theories, including those influenced by Butler. She argued that moral theories based on consequences or duties were flawed and that the basis of morality should be in the virtues and the concept of 'the good.'

Butler's approach, focusing on self-legislation and conscience, might have been seen by Anscombe as problematic because it relies on an internal guide that isn't necessarily reliable. So perhaps she criticized him for thinking that we can derive moral obligations from human nature, which she might have seen as an 'ought' from 'is' problem.

Wait, option C says "the notion of 'legislating for oneself' is absurd." That sounds like it's pointing out that Butler's idea of self-legislation is flawed. Anscombe might have argued that Butler's approach is incoherent because you can't just make up moral laws for yourself; they have to be based on something external.

Alternatively, option H says "the idea of moral obligations is incoherent." That could be another point. Anscombe might have questioned whether moral obligations are real or if they're just constructs.

But I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me try to recall specific points. Butler talked about conscience as the voice of God within, but Anscombe, being more secular, would argue that conscience isn't infallible. So option F: "our consciences are fallible" might be the point.

Wait, but I think Anscombe's main criticism was about the logical structure of ethical theories. She argued that you can't derive 'ought' from 'is,' which is option G. She might have seen Butler's approach as trying to do that.

Alternatively, Butler's idea that humans have a rational nature that can立法 (legislate) for themselves might have been seen by Anscombe as an attempt to derive 'ought' from 'is,' which she found wanting.

So, putting it together, Anscombe's critique likely centers on the logical issue of deriving moral prescriptions from descriptive statements, which would point to option G.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Another angle: Butler's view was that humans have a self-interested nature, and from that, we can derive moral duties. Anscombe might have found this reductionist or simplistic, but that's more about the content rather than the method.

Alternatively, considering the options, option C says the notion of legislating for oneself is absurd. That seems to target Butler's approach, which was that humans can and should create moral laws for themselves based on their rational nature.

Anscombe, perhaps, would argue that this is incoherent because moral obligations can't be self-made; they have to be based on something external, like the virtues or the divine (but she didn't necessarily go for the divine). So option C could be the answer.

Wait, but I'm getting confused again. Let me think about the main points of their philosophies. Butler's ethics are egoistic but with a twist—he believed that self-interest and benevolence are aligned because self-interest is in the long run. He argued against selfishness and for a rational approach to ethics.

Anscombe's critique was more about the structure of ethical arguments. She argued that ethical theories that try to derive 'ought' from 'is' are flawed. She also criticized the idea that moral obligations are based on human nature in a way that allows derivation of 'ought' statements.

So, if Butler's approach involved trying to derive moral obligations (the 'ought') from human nature or rationality (the 'is'), then Anscombe would have criticized this as impossible, which is option G.

Alternatively, another angle: Butler's concept of the self as a kind of legislator might have been seen by Anscombe as problematic because it's an incoherent way to establish moral obligations. That would be option C.

I'm still a bit stuck. Let me see if I can find any direct references. I remember that Anscombe's "Modern Moral Philosophy" attacks the idea that moral theories can be based on reasoning from facts, which is the 'is' to 'ought' problem. She argues that such theories are fundamentally flawed because they can't bridge that gap.

Butler, on the other hand, tried to ground ethics in human nature and rationality, which might involve that very issue. So Anscombe would have criticized him for trying to derive 'ought' from 'is,' making option G the correct answer.

Wait, but the question is about Anscombe's specific criticism of Butler. I think she did target Butler in her critiques, pointing out that his approach relies on an 'ought' from 'is' fallacy.

So, putting it all together, I think the answer is G: the idea of deriving an 'ought' from an 'is' is impossible, which Anscombe would say Butler tried to do.
