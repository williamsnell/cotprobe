Okay, so I've got this question about the mobility of electrolytic ions. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. The question asks how the mobility changes in four different scenarios: increasing the ion's size, increasing its charge, increasing temperature, and placing it in a solvent of lower viscosity. The options are from A to J, each giving a different combination of increases and decreases for each part.

Let me break this down part by part.

Starting with part (a): increasing the size of the ion. I remember that larger ions are generally less mobile because they have more mass. So when you increase the size, the mobility should decrease. So for (a), the answer is decrease.

Moving to part (b): increasing the charge on the ion. Oh, wait, higher charge usually means a stronger electric force acting on the ion when an electric field is applied. So more charge should make the ion move faster, right? That means mobility increases. So (b) is an increase.

Part (c): increasing temperature. Temperature affects the viscosity of the solvent. When temperature goes up, the solvent becomes less viscous, which should make it easier for ions to move. Also, higher temps might give the ions more kinetic energy, so they can move more freely. So increasing temperature should increase mobility. So (c) is an increase.

Part (d): placing the ion in a solvent of lower viscosity. Lower viscosity means the solvent is less thick, so less resistance for the ion to move. That should definitely increase mobility. So (d) is an increase.

Wait, but let me make sure. I think mobility is the speed at which an ion moves under an electric field. So the formula might involve charge, size, and maybe temperature and viscosity. Oh right, the mobility (μ) is given by something like μ = (e)/(6πηr) * something with charge. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the formulas. Oh, the Stokes' equation or something related to electrophoresis. I think the Smoluchowski equation is μ = (e u)/(6πηr), but I'm not certain. Alternatively, mobility might depend inversely on the ion's radius and the viscosity of the medium.

So for (a), larger radius (r) would decrease mobility because μ is inversely proportional to r. So (a) decrease. Correct.

For (b), higher charge (z) would increase mobility since μ is proportional to z. So (b) increase. Makes sense.

For (c), increasing temperature would decrease the viscosity (η) of the solvent. Since μ is inversely proportional to η, lower η means higher μ. So (c) increase. Right.

For (d), same as (c), lower viscosity increases mobility. So (d) increase.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me think again about part (c). Sometimes, higher temperature can have other effects. For example, if the solution gets more viscous with temperature, but wait, no, higher temperature usually lowers viscosity. Like honey is more viscous when cold. So yes, lower viscosity at higher temp, so mobility increases. So (c) increase.

Now looking at the options, I need to match these four parts. The four parts are a) decrease, b) increase, c) increase, d) increase. So looking at the options:

Option F: a) Increase, b) Decrease, c) Increase, d) Increase. No, (a) is decrease.

Option C: a) Decrease, b) Increase, c) Increase, d) Increase. Wait, that's exactly what I concluded. Let me check the options again.

Wait, the options go from A to J, each with four parts. So looking at option C: (a) decrease, (b) increase, (c) increase, (d) increase. So that's correct.

But wait, let me check if I misread the options. Let me list all the options again:

A: a) Increase, b) Decrease, c) Decrease, d) Decrease

B: a) Increase, b) Decrease, c) Decrease, d) Increase

C: a) Decrease, b) Increase, c) Increase, d) Increase

D: a) Increase, b) Increase, c) Decrease, d) Decrease

E: a) Increase, b) Increase, c) Increase, d) Decrease

F: a) Increase, b) Decrease, c) Increase, d) Increase

G: a) Decrease, b) Decrease, c) Increase, d) Decrease

H: a) Decrease, b) Increase, c) Increase, d) Decrease

I: a) Decrease, b) Increase, c) Decrease, d) Decrease

J: a) Decrease, b) Decrease, c) Decrease, d) Increase

So option C is a) decrease, b) increase, c) increase, d) increase. Which matches my analysis.

Wait, but wait another thing. Sometimes, when you increase the charge, the ion might experience more interactions with the solvent, like more friction. But I think the dominant factor is the electric force. So I think higher charge increases mobility.

Alternatively, maybe I'm confusing charge and valence. For example, a higher charge (more protons or electrons) would make the ion more responsive to the electric field, so yes, higher mobility.

So I'm confident that the correct option is C.

The mobility of an electrolytic ion depends on factors such as size, charge, temperature, and solvent viscosity. 

(a) Increasing the ion's size decreases its mobility because larger ions have more mass, making them less mobile.  
(b) Increasing the charge on the ion increases its mobility as a higher charge enhances the electric force acting on it.  
(c) Increasing temperature increases mobility because higher temperatures reduce solvent viscosity and provide more kinetic energy to the ion.  
(d) Placing the ion in a solvent of lower viscosity also increases mobility, as lower viscosity reduces resistance to movement.  

From the analysis, the correct option is:

C: a) Decrease, b) Increase, c) Increase, d) Increase.

Answer: C
