Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find v_ab(t) given that v(t) is 16e^(-3t)u(t). The transform relation is V_ab(s) = [3V(s) + 3s + 27]/(s² + 6s +8). Hmm, let's break this down.

First, I remember that the Laplace transform is involved here. The question gives V(s) in terms of V_ab(s), so I need to find V_ab(s) and then take its inverse Laplace transform to get v_ab(t).

Let me write down what I know. V(t) is given as 16e^(-3t)u(t), so its Laplace transform V(s) should be 16/(s +3), right? Because the Laplace transform of e^(-at)u(t) is 1/(s+a).

So V(s) = 16/(s+3). Now, plug this into the given equation for V_ab(s):

V_ab(s) = [3*(16/(s+3)) + 3s +27]/(s² +6s +8).

Let me compute the numerator step by step. 3*(16/(s+3)) is 48/(s+3). So the numerator becomes [48/(s+3) + 3s +27]. Wait, I need to combine these terms into a single fraction to make it easier to handle.

Let me find a common denominator for the terms. The denominator of the first term is (s+3), and the others are polynomials. So I'll multiply each term by (s+3) to combine them. Let me compute:

48/(s+3) + 3s +27 = [48 + 3s(s+3) +27(s+3)]/(s+3).

Wait, no, that's not right. Actually, when I have terms with and without denominators, I should adjust each term accordingly. Let me rewrite the numerator:

Numerator = 3V(s) +3s +27 = 3*(16/(s+3)) +3s +27.

So that's 48/(s+3) +3s +27. To combine these, I need a common denominator, which is (s+3). So I'll write 3s as 3s*(s+3)/(s+3) and 27 as 27*(s+3)/(s+3).

So the numerator becomes [48 +3s(s+3)+27(s+3)]/(s+3). Let me compute that:

3s*(s+3) =3s² +9s.

27*(s+3)=27s +81.

Adding them all up: 48 +3s² +9s +27s +81 = 3s² + (9s+27s) + (48+81) = 3s² +36s +129.

So the numerator is (3s² +36s +129)/(s+3).

Now the denominator of V_ab(s) is s² +6s +8, which I can factor. Let me see: looking for two numbers that multiply to 8 and add to 6. That's 2 and 4, so (s+2)(s+4).

So V_ab(s) = [ (3s² +36s +129)/(s+3) ] / [ (s+2)(s+4) ) ] = (3s² +36s +129) / [ (s+3)(s+2)(s+4) ) ].

Hmm, but wait, perhaps there's a better way. Alternatively, maybe I can factor the numerator further or perform partial fraction decomposition. Let me see.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I should leave V_ab(s) as [3V(s) +3s +27]/(s²+6s+8) and compute it step by step.

Wait, let me substitute V(s) =16/(s+3) into V_ab(s):

V_ab(s) = [3*(16/(s+3)) +3s +27] / (s^2 +6s +8).

Which is [48/(s+3) +3s +27] / (s^2 +6s +8).

Now, let me compute the numerator as a single fraction. So the numerator is 48/(s+3) +3s +27. Let me express all terms over (s+3):

3s = 3s*(s+3)/(s+3) = (3s² +9s)/(s+3).

27 =27*(s+3)/(s+3) = (27s +81)/(s+3).

So adding all together: [48 +3s² +9s +27s +81]/(s+3) = [3s² +36s +129]/(s+3).

So V_ab(s) = [3s² +36s +129]/( (s+3)(s+2)(s+4) ).

Hmm, that's correct. Now, I need to perform partial fraction decomposition on this expression to find the inverse Laplace transform.

Let me write V_ab(s) as A/(s+2) + B/(s+3) + C/(s+4), where A, B, C are constants to determine.

So:

[3s² +36s +129]/( (s+3)(s+2)(s+4) ) = A/(s+2) + B/(s+3) + C/(s+4).

Multiplying both sides by (s+3)(s+2)(s+4):

3s² +36s +129 = A(s+3)(s+4) + B(s+2)(s+4) + C(s+2)(s+3).

Now, to find A, B, C, I can substitute suitable values for s.

Let's set s = -3:

Left side: 3*(-3)^2 +36*(-3) +129 = 3*9 -108 +129 = 27 -108 +129 = (27+129) -108 = 156 -108 =48.

Right side: A*(-3+3)(-3+4)=A*(0)(1)=0.

B term: B*(-3+2)(-3+4) = B*(-1)(1) = -B.

C term: C*(-3+2)(-3+3) = C*(-1)(0)=0.

So 48 = 0 + (-B) + 0 → B = -48.

Next, set s = -2:

Left side: 3*(-2)^2 +36*(-2) +129 = 3*4 -72 +129 =12 -72 +129 = (12+129) -72= 141 -72=69.

Right side: A*(-2+3)(-2+4)=A*(1)(2)=2A.

B term: B= -48, but when s=-2, B term would be B*(-2+2)(-2+4)= B*(0)(2)=0.

C term: C*(-2+2)(-2+3)= C*(0)(1)=0.

So 69= 2A → A=69/2=34.5.

Now, set s = -4:

Left side: 3*(-4)^2 +36*(-4) +129 = 3*16 -144 +129 =48 -144 +129= (48+129) -144= 177 -144=33.

Right side: A term: A*(-4+3)(-4+4)= A*(-1)(0)=0.

B term: B*(-4+2)(-4+4)= B*(-2)(0)=0.

C term: C*(-4+2)(-4+3)= C*(-2)(-1)=2C.

So 33= 2C → C=33/2=16.5.

So now, A=69/2, B=-48, C=33/2.

Thus, V_ab(s)= (69/2)/(s+2) + (-48)/(s+3) + (33/2)/(s+4).

Now, taking the inverse Laplace transform term by term:

- The inverse Laplace of (69/2)/(s+2) is (69/2)e^(-2t).

- The inverse Laplace of (-48)/(s+3) is -48 e^(-3t).

- The inverse Laplace of (33/2)/(s+4) is (33/2) e^(-4t).

So v_ab(t) = (69/2) e^(-2t) -48 e^(-3t) + (33/2) e^(-4t).

Wait, but looking at the options, the order might be different, so I should arrange the terms in order of exponents.

Wait, in the options, the terms are usually listed in order of increasing exponents, but let me check each option.

Looking at the options:

Option J: -48e^-3t + (69/2)e^-2t + (33/2)e^-4t.

Yes, that matches exactly what I have.

Wait, but let me check if I did the partial fractions correctly. Because sometimes when I do substitutions, I might make a mistake.

Let me recheck the substitution for s=-2:

s=-2: V_ab(s) numerator is 3*(-2)^2 +36*(-2)+129 = 12 -72 +129=69.

On the right side, when s=-2, the equation is:

A*(-2+3)(-2+4)=A*(1)(2)=2A.

So 69=2A → A=34.5 (which is 69/2), correct.

Similarly for s=-4:

Numerator:3*(-4)^2 +36*(-4)+129=48-144+129=33.

Right side: C*(-4+2)(-4+3)=C*(-2)(-1)=2C → 33=2C → C=16.5=33/2, correct.

B was found when s=-3: 48 = -B → B=-48, correct.

So the partial fractions are correct, and thus the inverse transform is correct.

Now, looking at the options:

Option J is: -48e^-3t + (69/2)e^-2t + (33/2)e^-4t.

Yes, that's exactly what I derived. So the answer should be J.

The problem involves finding \( v_{ab}(t) \) given \( v(t) = 16e^{-3t}u(t) \) and the transform relation \( V_{ab}(s) = \frac{3V(s) + 3s + 27}{s^2 + 6s + 8} \). 

1. **Compute \( V(s) \):**  
   The Laplace transform of \( v(t) = 16e^{-3t}u(t) \) is \( V(s) = \frac{16}{s + 3} \).

2. **Substitute \( V(s) \) into \( V_{ab}(s) \):**  
   Substituting \( V(s) \) into the given relation gives:  
   \[
   V_{ab}(s) = \frac{3\left(\frac{16}{s + 3}\right) + 3s + 27}{s^2 + 6s + 8}
   \]  
   Simplifying the numerator:  
   \[
   3\left(\frac{16}{s + 3}\right) + 3s + 27 = \frac{48}{s + 3} + 3s + 27
   \]  
   Combining terms over a common denominator:  
   \[
   \frac{3s^2 + 36s + 129}{s + 3}
   \]  
   Thus,  
   \[
   V_{ab}(s) = \frac{3s^2 + 36s + 129}{(s + 3)(s + 2)(s + 4)}
   \]

3. **Partial Fraction Decomposition:**  
   Express \( V_{ab}(s) \) as:  
   \[
   V_{ab}(s) = \frac{A}{s + 2} + \frac{B}{s + 3} + \frac{C}{s + 4}
   \]  
   Solving for \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \) using substitution:  
   - \( A = \frac{69}{2} \)  
   - \( B = -48 \)  
   - \( C = \frac{33}{2} \)  

4. **Inverse Laplace Transform:**  
   Taking the inverse Laplace transform of each term:  
   \[
   v_{ab}(t) = \frac{69}{2}e^{-2t} - 48e^{-3t} + \frac{33}{2}e^{-4t}
   \]  

5. **Match with Options:**  
   The correct option is **J**, which matches the derived expression.
