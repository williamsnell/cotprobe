Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about the reaction between cream of tartar and baking powder when hot water is added. The equation given is NaHCO3 + KHC4H6O6 → NaKC4H4O6 + H2O + CO2(g). The question is asking, when 4.2 grams of NaHCO3 (baking powder) is used, what volume of CO2 is liberated at 273°C. The options are from A to J, and I need to pick the correct one.

Hmm, let's break this down step by step. First, I think I need to figure out how much sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) is reacting here. Then, since it's a chemical reaction, I can use stoichiometry to find out how much CO2 is produced. Once I have the moles of CO2, I can use the ideal gas law to find the volume at the given temperature.

Wait, but the temperature given is 273°C? That seems a bit high. Oh wait, no, wait—273 K is 0°C, so 273°C would be a very high temperature. Wait, maybe that's a typo? Because 273 K is 0°C, and 273°C is much hotter. Alternatively, perhaps it's a mistake, and they meant 273 K, which is 0°C. But the problem says 273°C, so I'll go with that, though that's quite high.

Wait, but maybe I should double-check the problem statement. Let me read it again. Oh, it says, "at 273°C." So that's correct. Let me proceed with that.

First, I need to find the moles of NaHCO3. The molar mass of NaHCO3 is needed. Sodium (Na) is about 23 g/mol, hydrogen (H) is 1, carbon (C) is 12, and oxygen (O) is 16. So NaHCO3 is Na (23) + H (1) + C (12) + 3 O (16*3=48). Adding those up: 23 +1=24, +12=36, +48=84 g/mol.

So the molar mass of NaHCO3 is 84 g/mol. The given mass is 4.2 grams. So moles = mass/molar mass = 4.2 g / 84 g/mol = 0.05 moles.

Wait, that's 0.05 moles of NaHCO3. Now, looking at the balanced equation, I see that one mole of NaHCO3 produces one mole of CO2. So the mole ratio is 1:1. So moles of CO2 would be 0.05 moles.

Next, I need to find the volume of CO2 at 273°C. Wait, 273°C is 300.15 K? Wait, no, 273°C is 273 + 273.15? Wait, no, wait: to convert Celsius to Kelvin, you add 273.15. So 273°C is 273 + 273.15 = 546.15 K. Hmm, that's a high temperature. Alternatively, perhaps the problem meant 273 K, which is 0°C. That would make sense because 273 K is a standard temperature for gas calculations, especially when using the ideal gas law at STP (Standard Temperature and Pressure, which is 0°C and 1 atm). So perhaps it's a typo, and the intended temperature is 273 K, not 273°C. But since the problem states 273°C, I have to go with that.

Wait, but let me check: the problem says 273°C. So I'll proceed with that, but maybe I should consider whether that makes sense. Alternatively, perhaps the question is correct, and I should proceed.

So, using the ideal gas law: PV = nRT.

I need to find the volume V. So rearranging, V = nRT/P.

I know n is 0.05 moles. R is the gas constant, which is 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K). T is 273°C, which is 546 K. Wait, no, wait: 273°C is 273 + 273.15 = 546.15 K. Let me approximate it as 546 K.

But wait, what about the pressure? The problem doesn't specify pressure. It might assume standard pressure, which is 1 atm. So P = 1 atm.

So plugging in the numbers:

V = (0.05 mol) * (0.0821 L·atm/mol·K) * (546 K) / (1 atm).

Let me calculate that step by step.

First, 0.05 * 0.0821 = 0.004105.

Then, 0.004105 * 546 ≈ let's see:

0.004105 * 500 = 2.0525,

0.004105 * 46 = approximately 0.18883.

Adding them together: 2.0525 + 0.18883 ≈ 2.2413 L.

Wait, that's about 2.24 liters. Let me check the options again.

Options are:

A:11.2 l

B:0.05 moles

C:22.4 l

D:1.12 l

E:2.24 l

F:4.48 l

G:0.112 l

H:0.224 l

I:3.36 l

J:5.60 l

So E is 2.24 l, which matches my calculation. But wait, this is under the assumption that the temperature is 273°C, which is 546 K. But if the problem had meant 273 K (0°C), let's see how that would change things.

If T is 273 K (0°C), then V = 0.05 * 0.0821 * 273 / 1.

0.05 * 0.0821 = 0.004105.

0.004105 * 273 ≈ let's calculate:

0.004105 * 273 = ?

0.004105 * 200 = 0.821,

0.004105 * 73 ≈ 0.299,

Total ≈ 0.821 + 0.299 = 1.12 L.

So that would be option D:1.12 l.

Hmm, but the problem says 273°C, which is 546 K, leading to 2.24 L, option E. But perhaps the problem intended 273 K, which is 0°C, making the answer D:1.12 l.

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in the stoichiometry. Let me recheck the reaction equation.

The reaction is NaHCO3 + KHC4H6O6 → NaKC4H4O6 + H2O + CO2(g).

So for every mole of NaHCO3, one mole of CO2 is produced. So 4.2 g NaHCO3 is 0.05 moles, leading to 0.05 moles CO2.

Now, using the ideal gas law at 273°C (546 K), the volume is 2.24 L, which is option E.

But wait, 0.05 moles at 273 K would give 1.12 L, which is option D. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider whether the reaction is correct. Let me check the balanced equation again.

NaHCO3 + KHC4H6O6 → NaKC4H4O6 + H2O + CO2.

Yes, that looks balanced. Na on the left is 1, on the right 1. K is 1 on each side. Carbon: 1 (NaHCO3) + 4 (KHC4H6O6) → 4 (NaKC4H4O6) + 1 (CO2) → 4 +1=5, correct. Hydrogen: NaHCO3 has 1 H, KHC4H6O6 has 6 H → total 7 H on left. On the right, NaKC4H4O6 has 4 H, H2O has 2 H, CO2 has none. So 4+2=6 H. Wait, that's a problem. Left has 7 H, right has 6 H. So perhaps the equation is not balanced. Did I make a mistake here?

Wait, let's check the reaction again. The correct reaction between sodium bicarbonate and potassium hydrogen tartrate (cream of tartar) is:

NaHCO3 + KHC4H6O6 → NaKC4H4O6 + H2O + CO2.

Wait, but in reality, the reaction may produce more water or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the actual balanced equation is different. Let me balance it properly.

Wait, perhaps I should write the correct balanced equation.

But maybe I'm overcomplicating. The problem gives the equation as NaHCO3 + KHC4H6O6 → NaKC4H4O6 + H2O + CO2. So perhaps the equation is already balanced, but perhaps I made a mistake in checking the H count.

Let me recount the H on each side.

Left side: NaHCO3 has 1 H, KHC4H6O6 has 6 H → total 7 H.

Right side: NaKC4H4O6 has 4 H, H2O has 2 H, CO2 has none. So 4+2=6 H. That's a problem because 7 H on left, 6 on right. So the equation isn't balanced. But perhaps the problem assumes it is, and I should proceed with the given equation.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the KHC4H6O6 is (KC4H6O6H?), but perhaps the actual formula is different. Alternatively, perhaps the equation is correct, and I'm miscalculating.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the H count. Let me count again.

NaHCO3: 1 H.

KHC4H6O6: So that's potassium (K), then HC4H6O6. The HC4H6O6 has 6 H's? Let's see: the formula is C4H6O6. So for KHC4H6O6, the H comes from the H attached to C, so that's 1 H from the H in the formula, plus 6 H from the C4H6 part. Wait, no, the formula is KHC4H6O6. So the H is part of the HC4H6O6 group. Wait, the formula is KHC4H6O6, which is potassium hydrogen tartrate. The molecular formula is C4H5KO6. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me check.

Wait, potassium hydrogen tartrate is KHC4H4O6. Or is it KHC4H6O6? Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think: tartaric acid is H2C4H6O6, so the potassium salt would be KHC4H6O6 (if it's the acid losing one H). So KHC4H6O6 would be the formula for potassium hydrogen tartrate.

In that case, the left side has NaHCO3 (1 H) + KHC4H6O6 (6 H) → total 7 H.

On the right side, NaKC4H4O6 has 4 H, H2O has 2 H → total 6 H. So that's a problem. So the equation is not balanced. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should check the correct balanced equation. Let me think: perhaps the reaction is:

2 NaHCO3 + KHC4H6O6 → Na2C4H4O6 + 2 H2O + 2 CO2.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the given equation is correct, and I'm making a mistake in counting.

Alternatively, perhaps the given equation is correct, and perhaps the H count is balanced in a way I'm not seeing. Let me try again.

Left side: NaHCO3 has 1 H, KHC4H6O6 has 6 H → 7 H.

Right side: NaKC4H4O6 has 4 H, H2O has 2 H, and CO2 has 0 → total 6 H.

So 7 H on left, 6 on right. That's a discrepancy. So the equation as given is not balanced. So perhaps the problem has a typo, but I'll proceed with the given equation because the question seems to present it as such.

So, moving forward, I'll proceed with the stoichiometry as given, assuming that one mole of NaHCO3 produces one mole of CO2.

So, moles of CO2 = 0.05.

Now, using the ideal gas law at 273°C (546 K), V = nRT/P.

n=0.05, R=0.0821, T=546 K, P=1 atm.

So V= (0.05) * 0.0821 * 546 / 1.

Calculating:

0.05 * 0.0821 = 0.004105.

0.004105 * 546 ≈ 2.2413 L.

So approximately 2.24 L, which is option E.

But wait, the problem states the temperature as 273°C, which is correct. So the answer should be E:2.24 l.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem intended 273 K, which is 0°C. Let me calculate that scenario.

If T=273 K,

V = 0.05 * 0.0821 * 273.

0.05 * 0.0821 = 0.004105.

0.004105 * 273 ≈ 1.12 L, which is option D.

Hmm, but the problem says 273°C, so the correct approach would be to use 546 K, making the answer E:2.24 l.

Wait, but looking at the options again, option E is 2.24 l, which matches the calculation at 546 K.

So, I think the correct answer is E:2.24 l.

The reaction between sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO₃) and potassium hydrogen tartrate (KHC₄H₆O₆) produces sodium potassium tartrate (NaKC₄H₄O₆), water (H₂O), and carbon dioxide (CO₂). The balanced equation is:

NaHCO₃ + KHC₄H₆O₆ → NaKC₄H₄O₆ + H₂O + CO₂.

First, calculate the moles of NaHCO₃. The molar mass of NaHCO₃ is 84 g/mol. Given 4.2 g of NaHCO₃:

\[
\text{Moles of NaHCO₃} = \frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Molar Mass}} = \frac{4.2 \, \text{g}}{84 \, \text{g/mol}} = 0.05 \, \text{mol}.
\]

From the balanced equation, 1 mole of NaHCO₃ produces 1 mole of CO₂. Thus, 0.05 moles of NaHCO₃ produce 0.05 moles of CO₂.

Next, use the ideal gas law to find the volume of CO₂ at 273°C (546 K) and 1 atm pressure:

\[
V = \frac{nRT}{P}.
\]

Substitute \( n = 0.05 \, \text{mol} \), \( R = 0.0821 \, \text{L·atm/(mol·K)} \), \( T = 546 \, \text{K} \), and \( P = 1 \, \text{atm} \):

\[
V = \frac{(0.05)(0.0821)(546)}{1} = 2.24 \, \text{L}.
\]

Thus, the volume of CO₂ liberated is **2.24 L**, corresponding to option E.

Answer: E
