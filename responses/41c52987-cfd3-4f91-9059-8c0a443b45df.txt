Question:

The flux of visible photons reaching Earth from the North Star is about $4 \times 10^3 \mathrm{~mm}^{-2} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}$. Of these photons, 30 per cent are absorbed or scattered by the atmosphere and 25 per cent of the surviving photons are scattered by the surface of the cornea of the eye. A further 9 per cent are absorbed inside the cornea. The area of the pupil at night is about $40 \mathrm{~mm}^2$ and the response time of the eye is about $0.1 \mathrm{~s}$. Of the photons passing through the pupil, about 43 per cent are absorbed in the ocular medium. How many photons from the North Star are focused onto the retina in $0.1 \mathrm{~s}$ ?

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about calculating the number of photons from the North Star that reach the retina of the eye in a certain time. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the problem states that the flux of visible photons reaching Earth from the North Star is about 4 × 10^3 mm⁻² s⁻¹. Flux is the number of photons per unit area per unit time, right? So that means every square millimeter gets 4,000 photons per second.

Wait, the question is asking about the number of photons focused onto the retina in 0.1 seconds. So I think I'll need to multiply the flux by the area of the pupil and the time, but considering all the losses along the way.

Let me list out all the losses mentioned:

1. 30% absorbed or scattered by the atmosphere. So only 70% survive that step.
2. Of the surviving photons, 25% are scattered by the cornea surface. So 75% make it past that.
3. Then, 9% are absorbed inside the cornea. So 91% pass through.
4. After the cornea, 43% are absorbed in the ocular medium, which leaves 57% going through.
5. The problem also mentions the area of the pupil is 40 mm², and the response time is 0.1 s.

So the total path is: Earth's surface (flux) → through atmosphere → through cornea's surface → through cornea → through ocular medium → onto retina.

Wait, but the flux is given as reaching Earth, so maybe the losses start after that. Let me think.

The flux is already the number of photons hitting Earth's atmosphere. So the first loss is 30% in the atmosphere. So after atmosphere, we have 70% of the original flux.

Then, the problem says 25% of the survivors are scattered by the cornea surface. Wait, does that mean 25% are lost, so 75% pass through? Or is it 25% scattered, so 75% go on? I think it's the latter, so 75% pass through.

Then, 9% absorbed inside the cornea, so 91% pass through.

Then, 43% absorbed in the ocular medium, so 57% pass through.

Wait, but wait—the problem says: "Of the photons passing through the pupil, about 43% are absorbed in the ocular medium." So that's after the pupil. But the pupil's area is 40 mm², which will determine how many photons pass through into the eye.

Wait, let me structure this correctly. The process is:

Flux (4e3 mm⁻² s⁻¹) → atmosphere → then through the pupil → then through cornea surface → then through cornea → then through ocular medium → reach the retina.

Wait, but the way the problem is phrased: "Of these photons, 30% are absorbed or scattered by the atmosphere and 25% of the surviving photons are scattered by the surface of the cornea..."

Wait, so the 30% loss is from the total flux, then 25% of the remaining are scattered by the cornea surface, then 9% are absorbed inside the cornea, then 43% are absorbed in the ocular medium of the photons that pass through the pupil.

Wait, but the 43% is about the photons that pass through the pupil. So let's clarify the steps.

1. Start with flux F = 4e3 mm⁻² s⁻¹.

2. 30% are lost in atmosphere, so remaining is 70% of F.

3. Then, 25% of these surviving photons are scattered by the cornea surface → so 75% pass through.

4. Then, 9% are absorbed in cornea → 91% pass through.

5. Photons that pass through pupil: the pupil area is 40 mm², so the number per second is F * area, but after all losses.

Wait, perhaps I should model this as the initial flux, then apply each loss step by step, then multiply by the pupil area and time.

Let me think in terms of number of photons:

Total photons per mm² per second: 4e3.

After atmosphere: 4e3 * 0.7 = 2.8e3 photons/mm²/s.

Then, 25% scattered by cornea surface → 75% pass through: 2.8e3 * 0.75 = 2.1e3 photons/mm²/s.

Then, 9% absorbed in cornea → 91% pass through: 2.1e3 * 0.91 = 1.911e3 photons/mm²/s.

Now, photons are entering the eye through the pupil. The pupil's area is 40 mm². So the number of photons passing through the pupil per second is:

1.911e3 photons/mm²/s * 40 mm² = 76.44e3 photons/s.

Wait, but wait—that's the number after the cornea, right? So after the cornea, the flux is 1.911e3 photons/mm²/s.

Then, through the pupil: 40 mm², so 40 * 1.911e3 = 76,440 photons per second.

But then, of these, 43% are absorbed in the ocular medium, so 57% pass through. So 76,440 * 0.57 ≈ 43,510.8 photons per second.

Wait, but wait a minute. The problem says that 43% are absorbed in the ocular medium of the photons passing through the pupil. So the 43% loss is after the pupil, not before. So the steps would be:

After cornea: 1.911e3 photons/mm²/s.

Photons entering pupil: 1.911e3 * 40 = 76,440 photons/s.

Then, 43% absorbed in ocular medium: 76,440 * 0.57 ≈ 43,510.8 photons/s.

But wait, the question is about the number of photons focused onto the retina in 0.1 s.

So that would be 43,510.8 photons/s * 0.1 s = 4,351.08 photons ≈ 4.35e3.

Looking at the options, option J is 4.9e3, D is 4.4e3, and others are around that. Hmm, but wait, maybe I made a mistake in the steps.

Wait, let me recheck.

Wait, the problem says:

"Of the photons passing through the pupil, about 43 per cent are absorbed in the ocular medium."

So that 43% is of the photons that pass through the pupil, after the cornea losses.

So the steps are:

1. Initial flux: 4e3 photons/mm²/s.

2. After atmosphere: 4e3 * 0.7 = 2.8e3 photons/mm²/s.

3. After cornea surface scattering: 2.8e3 * 0.75 = 2.1e3 photons/mm²/s.

4. After cornea absorption: 2.1e3 * 0.91 = 1.911e3 photons/mm²/s.

5. Photons passing through pupil: 1.911e3 * 40 mm² = 76,440 photons/s.

6. After ocular medium absorption: 76,440 * 0.57 ≈ 43,510.8 photons/s.

7. Time is 0.1 s, so total photons: 43,510.8 * 0.1 ≈ 4,351.08 ≈ 4.35e3.

Looking at the options, option J is 4.9e3, D is 4.4e3. Hmm, but 4.35 is closer to 4.4. But perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, let me compute more accurately.

After cornea, it's 1.911e3 photons/mm²/s.

Multiply by 40 mm²: 1.911e3 * 40 = 76,440 photons per second.

Then, 43% absorbed, so 57% remain: 76,440 * 0.57.

Compute 76,440 * 0.57.

76,440 * 0.5 = 38,220.

76,440 * 0.07 = 5,350.8.

Adding them: 38,220 + 5,350.8 = 43,570.8 photons per second.

Multiply by 0.1 s: 4,357.08 photons.

Rounded, that's approximately 4.36e3, so about 4.4e3. So the answer would be D: 4.4e3.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss any steps. Maybe I missed something.

Wait, the problem says "the flux of visible photons reaching Earth", which I think is after passing through the atmosphere. So the 30% loss is already accounted for, so the 4e3 is the flux after atmosphere. Wait, no, the problem says the flux is about 4e3, and then 30% are lost. So initial flux is 4e3, 30% lost, so 70% remains.

Wait, that part seems correct. So after that, the 25% is applied to the surviving photons.

Alternatively, perhaps I should model it as:

Total flux F = 4e3 mm⁻² s⁻¹.

After atmosphere: F1 = F * 0.7 = 2.8e3.

Then, cornea surface: F2 = F1 * 0.75 = 2.1e3.

Cornea absorption: F3 = F2 * 0.91 = 1.911e3.

Then, through pupil area A =40 mm²: photons per second = F3 * A = 1.911e3 *40 =76,440.

Ocular medium: F4 = F3 * A * 0.57 =76,440 *0.57 =43,510.8 photons/s.

Time t=0.1s: 43,510.8 *0.1 =4,351.08.

So that's about 4,351 photons, which is 4.35e3. The options are D:4.4e3, J:4.9e3.

Hmm, so 4.35 is closer to 4.4 than 4.3. So option D is the answer.

The problem involves calculating the number of photons from the North Star that reach the retina in 0.1 seconds, considering various losses at each stage.

1. **Initial Flux**: $4 \times 10^3 \, \mathrm{mm}^{-2} \, \mathrm{s}^{-1}$.
2. **After Atmosphere**: 30% absorbed, so 70% remain: $4 \times 10^3 \times 0.7 = 2.8 \times 10^3 \, \mathrm{mm}^{-2} \, \mathrm{s}^{-1}$.
3. **After Cornea Surface Scattering**: 25% scattered, so 75% pass through: $2.8 \times 10^3 \times 0.75 = 2.1 \times 10^3 \, \mathrm{mm}^{-2} \, \mathrm{s}^{-1}$.
4. **After Cornea Absorption**: 9% absorbed, so 91% pass through: $2.1 \times 10^3 \times 0.91 = 1.911 \times 10^3 \, \mathrm{mm}^{-2} \, \mathrm{s}^{-1}$.
5. **Through Pupil**: Pupil area is $40 \, \mathrm{mm}^2$, so photons per second: $1.911 \times 10^3 \times 40 = 76,440 \, \mathrm{s}^{-1}$.
6. **After Ocular Medium Absorption**: 43% absorbed, so 57% pass through: $76,440 \times 0.57 = 43,510.8 \, \mathrm{s}^{-1}$.
7. **Over 0.1 Seconds**: Total photons reaching the retina: $43,510.8 \times 0.1 = 4,351 \approx 4.4 \times 10^3$.

The closest option is **D: 4.4 × 10³**.
