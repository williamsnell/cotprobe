Question:

A developer recently acquired a large vacant lot and wished to build a series of 10 tract homes on the lot to offer for sale. On May 1, he telephoned a number of contractors whom he had dealt with in the past and asked them to submit bids to build the homes. One of the contractors in turn sought bids from several subcontractors to determine the overall cost of the job. He notified each subcontractor that he intended to use their bids in submitting a general bid to the developer. A plumber submitted a bid to the contractor in the amount of $50,000, which the contractor used in computing the bid he sent to the developer. On June 1, the contractor submitted a bid to the developer in which he offered to build the 10 tract homes for $500,000. On June 4, the plumber notified the contractor that he had overbooked his crews and could not possibly do the work on the developer's job. On June 5, the developer sent the contractor a signed confirmation letter wherein he stated, "I hereby accept your offer to build the 10 tract homes for $500,000. ', Thereafter, the contractor hired another plumber to complete the plumbing work at a cost of $60,000. The contractor then explained the situation to the developer and requested that the overall cost of the job be increased to $510,000. The developer refused on the grounds that he had a contract for $500,000 and that this was the contractor's problem. The contractor then built the 10 tract homes, and the developer sent him a check for $500,000. Which of the following best supports a claim for $10,000 by the contractor against the plumber who refused to do the work?

Options:

A: The plumber's bid created an enforceable promissory estoppel situation.
B: An option contract was created, because the contractor, with the plumber's knowledge, used the plumber's bid in computing the bid he submitted to the developer.
C: The plumber had an implied contract with the contractor, which he violated by refusing to fulfill his bid.
D: The plumber had a moral obligation to fulfill his bid as it was already included in the contractor's total cost.
E: The contractor relied on the plumber's bid in good faith, creating an enforceable contract.
F: The plumber made an offer that the contractor accepted by using the plumber's bid in computing the bid he submitted to the developer.
G: The plumber's bid was a binding contract, which the plumber breached by refusing to do the work.
H: The contractor made an offer to the plumber that the plumber accepted when he submitted his bid.
I: The plumber's bid was a "firm offer" that was not revocable, since both the plumber and the contractor were merchants.
J: The plumber's bid constituted a unilateral contract which the contractor accepted by submitting his bid to the developer.

Alright, so I've got this legal question here about contracts between a developer, a contractor, and a plumber. I'm going to try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the facts are and what the question is asking.

So, the developer bought a lot and wants to build 10 tract homes. He asked contractors for bids on May 1. One contractor then got subcontractors to bid, including a plumber who quoted $50k. The contractor used all these bids, including the plumber's, to come up with a total bid of $500k for the developer. Then, on June 4, the plumber said he can't do the job because he's overbooked. The developer accepted the contractor's bid on June 5, and the contractor had to hire another plumber for $60k, adding $10k to the cost. The developer refused to pay the extra, so the contractor is suing the plumber for $10k. The question is which option best supports the contractor's claim.

I need to figure out the legal theory that allows the contractor to claim $10k from the plumber. Let's look at the options.

First, understanding the scenario: The plumber gave a bid, the contractor used it in their bid to the developer, who accepted it. Then the plumber backed out, forcing the contractor to pay more. So, the issue is whether the plumber's bid created a binding obligation that the contractor can enforce.

Let's go through each option.

Option A: Promissory estoppel. That's when someone makes a promise that another relies on, even without a contract. The elements are a clear promise, reliance, and detriment. If the contract is enforceable under PE, the contractor might be able to claim. But I'm not sure if this is the best option here.

Option B: Option contract. An option is when one party pays for the right to accept or reject an offer within a certain time. The idea here is that the contractor used the plumber's bid in submitting to the developer. But I don't think the facts show consideration for an option. The plumber didn't get anything for their bid; it was just a quote. So maybe B isn't right.

Option C: Implied contract. That requires an intent to be bound and some consideration. The plumber's bid was just an offer, not an acceptance. So unless there's an implied agreement, which seems unlikely, C might not hold.

Option D: Moral obligation. That's not enforceable in court, so D is probably incorrect.

Option E: Contract based on reliance. The contractor relied on the plumber's bid, but for a contract, there needs to be acceptance. The contractor used the bid in their own bid, but that doesn't necessarily mean the offer was accepted. So E might not be the right theory.

Option F: Offer accepted by using the bid. Here, the argument is that the contractor's submission to the developer was an acceptance of the plumber's offer. But under the UCC, an offer can be accepted by performance, but the timing might matter. The developer accepted the contractor's bid on June 5, but the plumber withdrew on June 4. So if the contractor had already accepted the plumber's offer before June 5, then maybe. But I'm not sure if using the bid constitutes acceptance.

Option G: Binding contract because the bid was used. This would mean the plumber's bid was a binding offer that the contractor accepted by using it. Under UCC, if the offer specifies that it's irrevocable for a certain time, it's binding. But the facts don't say the plumber made it irrevocable. So G might not be correct unless there's a firm offer.

Option H: Contractor offered, plumber accepted by bidding. That seems backwards. The contractor was the one seeking bids, so the plumber made the offer, not the other way around. So H is probably wrong.

Option I: Firm offer under UCC. A firm offer is an offer that's written and signed by the merchant, making it irrevocable for a specified time. The plumber is a merchant (a subcontractor), and if the offer was in writing, it couldn't be revoked once the contractor relied on it. The facts don't mention writing, but the plumber sent a bid, which might be considered written. If the offer was firm, the contractor could hold the plumber to it. This seems like a strong possibility because if the offer was firm, the plumber couldn't back out once the contractor relied on it to make their bid.

Option J: Unilateral contract. That's when an offer is accepted by performance. But the plumber's bid was an offer, and the contractor's use of it in their bid might be an acceptance. However, a unilateral contract typically involves the offeror promising to pay upon performance, which isn't the case here. So J might not fit.

So, considering all options, I think I is the best answer. The plumber made a firm offer as a merchant, and the contractor relied on it in submitting their bid. Since the developer accepted the contractor's bid, the contractor had to perform, and the plumber's revocation was ineffective because the offer was firm and irrevocable. Therefore, the contractor can claim the $10k difference.

The best support for the contractor's claim is that the plumber's bid constituted a firm offer under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), which became irrevocable once the contractor relied on it. This is best captured in option I.
