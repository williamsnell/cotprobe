Okay, so I have this physics problem to solve. The question is about calculating the de Broglie wavelength of an electron moving at a certain speed. I remember that the de Broglie wavelength relates an object's momentum to its wavelength, right? The formula is λ = h / p, where h is Planck's constant and p is momentum.

Alright, the problem states that the electron is moving at 1/137th the speed of light. Hmm, 1/137 is a familiar number; I think it's approximately the inverse of the fine-structure constant, but maybe that's not important here. Anyway, I just need to find the speed of the electron.

First, let me jot down the constants I'll need. The speed of light, c, is about 3 x 10^8 meters per second. So, the electron's speed v would be c divided by 137. Let me calculate that: v = 3e8 m/s / 137. Let me do the division. 3 divided by 137 is roughly 0.021898, so v ≈ 2.1898e6 m/s. Wait, no, wait—3e8 divided by 137 is 3e8 /137 ≈ 2.19e6 m/s. Yeah, that seems right.

Next, I need the mass of the electron. I think it's about 9.11 x 10^-31 kilograms. Let me confirm that. Yep, m = 9.11e-31 kg.

So, momentum p is mass times velocity. So p = m*v. Plugging in the numbers: p = 9.11e-31 kg * 2.19e6 m/s. Let me compute that. 9.11 * 2.19 is approximately, let's see, 9 * 2 is 18, 0.11*2 is 0.22, 9*0.19 is about 1.71, and 0.11*0.19 is 0.0209. Adding those up: 18 + 0.22 + 1.71 + 0.0209 ≈ 19.95. So p ≈ 19.95e-25 kg·m/s. Wait, wait, no, let me recalculate that exponent. Because 1e-31 * 1e6 is 1e-25. So 9.11e-31 * 2.19e6 = (9.11 * 2.19) * 1e-25. Let me compute 9.11 * 2.19 accurately. 9 * 2 is 18, 9 * 0.19 is 1.71, 0.11 *2 is 0.22, 0.11 *0.19 is 0.0209. So adding 18 + 1.71 =19.71, plus 0.22 is 19.93, plus 0.0209 is 19.9509. So p ≈19.95e-25 kg·m/s, which is 1.995e-24 kg·m/s.

Wait, wait, that can't be right. Let me check the exponent again. 9.11e-31 * 2.19e6 = (9.11 * 2.19) * 10^(-31 +6) = 19.95 * 10^-25 = 1.995e-24 kg·m/s. Yeah, that's correct.

Now, Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s. So, the wavelength λ is h/p. Plugging in the numbers: λ = 6.626e-34 / 1.995e-24. Let me compute that. 6.626e-34 divided by 1.995e-24 is the same as (6.626 / 1.995) * 10^(-34 +24) = (3.323) * 10^-10 meters. Wait, because 6.626 divided by 2 is about 3.313, and 1.995 is almost 2, so yeah, approximately 3.323e-10 meters.

Converting meters to nanometers, since 1 nm is 1e-9 meters, so 3.323e-10 meters is 0.3323 nm. Looking at the options, option J is 0.332 nm. So that's the answer.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because I might have messed up somewhere. Let me go through the steps again quickly.

v = c / 137 ≈3e8 /137 ≈2.19e6 m/s.

m = 9.11e-31 kg.

p = m*v = 9.11e-31 *2.19e6 = (9.11 *2.19) *1e-25 = approx 19.95e-25 =1.995e-24 kg·m/s.

h =6.626e-34.

λ = h/p =6.626e-34 /1.995e-24 ≈3.323e-10 m = 0.332 nm.

Yes, that seems correct. So option J is the right answer.

The de Broglie wavelength is calculated using the formula λ = h / p, where h is Planck's constant and p is momentum. The electron's speed is given as 1/137th the speed of light, so v ≈ 2.19 × 10⁶ m/s. The mass of the electron is 9.11 × 10⁻³¹ kg, giving a momentum p ≈ 1.995 × 10⁻²⁴ kg·m/s. Using h = 6.626 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s, the wavelength λ ≈ 0.332 nm.
