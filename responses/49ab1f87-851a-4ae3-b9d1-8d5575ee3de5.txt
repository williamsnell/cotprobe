Answer:
    
<think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Quinones Bros., a company that's been around for four years. The question is asking about the annual rate of growth of their earnings after four years. The earnings are given by the formula sqrt(10t² + t + 236), and it's in thousands of dollars. I need to find the rate of growth as a percentage.

Hmm, let me start by understanding what the formula represents. The earnings after t years are modeled by the square root of a quadratic function in t. So, the function is E(t) = sqrt(10t² + t + 236). I think I need to find E(4) and maybe E(3), because the growth rate from year 3 to year 4 would give the annual rate after four years. Wait, no, actually, the problem says after four years, so maybe it's the growth over the entire period, but more likely, they want the growth rate from year 4 to year 5, or perhaps from year 3 to year 4? Or maybe it's the average annual growth over the four years. Hmm, the wording says "after four years," so perhaps it's the growth rate at the end of the fourth year, which would be the growth from year 4 to year 5? Or maybe from year 3 to year 4? I'm a bit confused.

Wait, the question is about the rate of growth after four years. So, perhaps it's the growth rate during the fourth year. That is, the change in earnings from the end of year 4 to the end of year 5. Alternatively, maybe it's the growth from year 4 to year 5, but since the company has been in business for four years, perhaps we're looking at the growth between year 4 and year 5 as the rate after four years.

Alternatively, maybe they're asking for the average annual growth rate over the four years. Let me think.

Wait, the question says, "What was the annual rate of growth of earnings after four years?" So, that probably refers to the growth rate at the end of year four. So, it's the rate between year four and year five. Alternatively, perhaps it's the growth rate over the period from year three to year four, which would be the rate after four years. Hmm, I'm a bit confused about the exact time frame.

Alternatively, maybe the rate is calculated as the difference between E(4) and E(3), divided by E(3), which would be the growth rate for the fourth year. That makes sense because after four years, the growth rate would be the rate at which they're growing in the fourth year, which is from t=3 to t=4.

Wait, but t is in years. So, t=0 is the start, t=1 is after one year, etc. So, to find the growth rate after four years, we might compute the growth from t=4 to t=5, but since the company is only four years old, maybe we're considering the growth rate in the fourth year, which is from t=3 to t=4.

Wait, but the problem says they've been in business for four years, so t=4 is their fourth year. So, perhaps the growth rate after four years is the rate during the fourth year, which would be from t=3 to t=4.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the average annual growth rate over the four years, which would involve calculating the total growth and then finding the compound annual growth rate (CAGR). But that's more complicated. Alternatively, it's the growth from t=3 to t=4, which is the growth in the fourth year.

I think I need to proceed step by step.

First, let's compute E(3) and E(4). Then, the growth rate from year 3 to year 4 would be (E(4) - E(3)) / E(3) * 100%.

So, let's compute E(3) and E(4).

E(t) = sqrt(10t² + t + 236).

Compute for t=3:

10*(3)^2 + 3 + 236 = 10*9 +3 +236 = 90 +3 +236 = 329.

So E(3) = sqrt(329) ≈ let's calculate that. 18^2 is 324, 19^2 is 361. 329 is 5 more than 324, so sqrt(329) ≈ 18.14 (since 18.14^2 ≈ 329).

Wait, 18.14^2 = (18 + 0.14)^2 = 18^2 + 2*18*0.14 + 0.14^2 = 324 + 5.04 + 0.0196 ≈ 329.0596. Close enough. So E(3) ≈ 18.14 thousand dollars.

Now E(4):

10*(4)^2 +4 +236 = 10*16=160 +4=164 +236=400.

So E(4) = sqrt(400) = 20 exactly. So E(4) is 20 thousand dollars.

Now, the growth from t=3 to t=4 is E(4) - E(3) = 20 - 18.14 = 1.86 thousand dollars.

The growth rate is (1.86 / 18.14) * 100%.

Let me compute that: 1.86 / 18.14 ≈ 0.1025. So 0.1025 *100% ≈ 10.25%. But that's not one of the options. Wait, the options are all below 6%, so that can't be right. Maybe I did something wrong.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check.

Wait, E(t) is sqrt(10t² + t + 236). So for t=3:

10*(3)^2 = 90, plus 3 is 93, plus 236 is 329. So sqrt(329) is indeed approximately 18.14.

At t=4: 10*16=160, plus 4=164, plus 236=400. sqrt(400)=20. So that's correct.

So the growth is 20 - 18.14 = 1.86. 1.86 / 18.14 ≈ 0.1025, so 10.25%. But none of the options are that high. The highest is J:4.00%. So I must have made a mistake in interpreting the problem.

Wait, maybe the question is asking for the annual rate of growth after four years, which would be the growth rate from year 4 to year 5, but since we don't have E(5), perhaps we can model the growth rate as the derivative at t=4. Wait, that might be a calculus approach. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the average annual growth rate over four years.

Wait, let's try calculating the average annual growth rate using the formula for compound growth.

The formula for CAGR is:

CAGR = (E(4) / E(0))^(1/4) - 1

But wait, E(0) is sqrt(10*0 +0 +236) = sqrt(236) ≈ 15.36.

E(4) is 20.

So CAGR = (20 / 15.36)^(1/4) - 1.

Let me compute that.

20 / 15.36 ≈ 1.302083333.

The fourth root of 1.302083333 is approximately e^(ln(1.302083333)/4).

ln(1.302083333) ≈ 0.266.

0.266 /4 ≈ 0.0665.

e^0.0665 ≈ 1.0688.

So CAGR ≈ 6.88% - 1 = 5.88%. Hmm, but that's still higher than the options provided, and also, the options don't include 5.88%, but option A is 5.00%, J is 4.00%, etc.

But wait, perhaps the question isn't about the average growth rate, but the growth rate at the end of four years, which would be the derivative at t=4.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting the growth rate from t=4 to t=5, but we don't have E(5), so perhaps we approximate it using the derivative.

Let me try that approach.

The derivative of E(t) with respect to t is (1/(2*sqrt(10t² + t +236))) * (20t +1).

So at t=4, E'(4) = (20*4 +1) / (2 * E(4)).

E(4)=20, so denominator is 40.

Numerator: 20*4=80 +1=81.

So E'(4)=81/(2*20)=81/40=2.025.

But E(t) is in thousands of dollars, so the derivative E'(4) is 2.025 thousand dollars per year. So the growth rate would be the percentage increase over the current value. So the growth rate is (E'(4) / E(4)) *100% = (2.025 /20)*100% = 10.125%.

Again, that's about 10%, which isn't in the options. Hmm, this is confusing.

Wait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me go back to the problem statement.

The question says, "What was the annual rate of growth of earnings after four years?" So perhaps it's the growth rate from year 3 to year 4, which is the growth during the fourth year. Wait, but when t=4, that's the end of the fourth year, so the growth from t=3 to t=4 is the growth rate in the fourth year, which is the rate after four years.

Wait, but when I calculated that earlier, the growth was about 10.25%, which isn't among the options. So maybe I made a mistake in the initial calculation.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating E(3) and E(4). Let me double-check.

E(3) = sqrt(10*(3)^2 +3 +236) = sqrt(90 +3 +236) = sqrt(329)≈18.14.

E(4)=sqrt(10*16 +4 +236)=sqrt(160+4+236)=sqrt(400)=20.

So the growth is 20 - 18.14 =1.86. The growth rate is (1.86 /18.14)*100 ≈10.25%.

But the options don't include that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the annual growth rate over the four years, which would be the average rate. Let's try using the formula for average annual growth rate (CAGR).

CAGR = (E(4)/E(0))^(1/4) -1.

E(0)=sqrt(236)≈15.36.

E(4)=20.

So (20/15.36)^(1/4) -1 ≈ (1.30208)^(0.25) -1.

Calculating 1.30208^(0.25). Let's compute ln(1.30208)=approx 0.266.

0.266/4=0.0665.

e^0.0665≈1.0688.

So 1.0688-1=0.0688, or 6.88%. That's about 6.88%, which is close to option D:6.00%, but not exact.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the growth rate from t=4 to t=5, but we don't have E(5). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the instantaneous rate of change at t=4, which would be the derivative.

Wait, earlier I calculated E'(4)=2.025, which is in thousands per year. The growth rate as a percentage is (E'(4)/E(4)) *100% = (2.025/20)*100=10.125%. Again, that's about 10%, which isn't in the options.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the problem. Maybe the earnings after t years is the function E(t), and the question is asking for the annual rate of growth at t=4, which would be the derivative at t=4, expressed as a percentage.

So, E(t) = sqrt(10t² + t +236).

E'(t) = (1/(2*sqrt(10t² + t +236))) * (20t +1).

At t=4, E'(4)= (20*4 +1)/(2*E(4)).

E(4)=20, so denominator=40.

Numerator=80 +1=81.

So E'(4)=81/40=2.025.

This is in thousands per year. So the rate of change is $2,025 per year. But to find the percentage growth rate, we can't directly do that because E(t) is a function, not a starting and ending value. Alternatively, perhaps the percentage growth rate is calculated as (E'(t)/E(t)) *100%, which would be the relative growth rate.

So at t=4, (2.025/20)*100=10.125%, which is about 10.13%, but again, that's not an option.

Wait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Perhaps the problem is asking for the annual growth rate over the four-year period, not the instantaneous rate. So perhaps the total growth is from E(0) to E(4), and then find the compound annual growth rate.

E(0)=sqrt(236)≈15.36.

E(4)=20.

The total growth factor is 20/15.36≈1.30208.

The CAGR is (1.30208)^(1/4) -1.

Calculating 1.30208^(0.25):

Let me compute ln(1.30208)=approx 0.266.

Divide by 4: 0.0665.

e^0.0665≈1.0688.

So 1.0688-1=0.0688, or 6.88%.

That's approximately 6.88%, which is close to option D:6.00%, but not exactly. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to approximate it as 6.88%, but the closest option is D:6.00%, which is 6%.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me try using a calculator for the fourth root of 1.30208.

1.30208^(1/4):

Let me compute it step by step.

1.30208^(0.25) = e^( (ln(1.30208)) * 0.25 )

ln(1.30208)≈0.266.

0.266 *0.25=0.0665.

e^0.0665≈1.0688.

So 6.88% is correct. But that's not an option. The options are A:5%, B:2.5%, C:3.2%, D:6%, E:2.2%, F:1%, G:3.5%, H:2.8%, I:1.5%, J:4%.

So 6.88% would be closest to D:6%, but perhaps the intended answer is D.

Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Perhaps the problem is simply asking for the growth from t=3 to t=4, which is 10.25%, but that's not an option. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the growth rate from t=4 to t=5, but since we don't have E(5), maybe we can approximate it using the derivative.

Wait, but the derivative at t=4 is 2.025, so the growth from t=4 to t=5 would be E(5) - E(4). Let's compute E(5):

E(5)=sqrt(10*25 +5 +236)=sqrt(250+5+236)=sqrt(491)≈22.16.

So growth from t=4 to t=5 is 22.16 -20=2.16.

Growth rate is (2.16/20)*100=10.8%. Again, not matching the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the average growth rate over the first four years, which would be (E(4)/E(0))^(1/4) -1 ≈6.88%, which is closest to D:6%.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the growth rate from t=4 to t=5, which is 10.8%, but that's not an option.

Wait, maybe I'm making a mistake in interpreting the formula. Let me check the formula again.

E(t)=sqrt(10t² +t +236).

Wait, perhaps I should compute the earnings at t=4 and t=5, and then find the growth from t=4 to t=5, which would be the growth rate after four years, i.e., the growth in the fifth year.

E(4)=20.

E(5)=sqrt(10*25 +5 +236)=sqrt(250 +5 +236)=sqrt(491)≈22.16.

So growth is 22.16 -20=2.16.

Growth rate is 2.16/20=0.108, or 10.8%. Again, not matching the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the growth rate from t=3 to t=4, which is 10.25%, but that's not an option either.

Wait, maybe the problem is asking for the average annual growth rate over the four years, which is from t=0 to t=4.

E(0)=sqrt(236)=≈15.36.

E(4)=20.

The total growth factor is 20/15.36≈1.30208.

The CAGR is (1.30208)^(1/4) -1≈6.88%, which is closest to option D:6%.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the growth rate as the percentage increase from t=4 to t=5, but that's 10.8%, which isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. It says, "the annual rate of growth of earnings after four years." So perhaps it's the rate at which the earnings are growing at the end of the fourth year, which would be the derivative at t=4.

As calculated earlier, E'(4)=2.025, which is in thousands per year. To find the percentage growth rate, we can use the relative growth rate, which is (E'(t)/E(t)) *100%.

So at t=4, that's (2.025/20)*100≈10.125%, which is about 10.13%. Not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps the problem is expecting the growth rate to be calculated as the difference between E(4) and E(3), which is 1.86, divided by E(3)=18.14, giving about 10.25%, but that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating E(3) and E(4). Let me check again.

E(3)=sqrt(10*(3)^2 +3 +236)=sqrt(90+3+236)=sqrt(329)=≈18.14.

E(4)=sqrt(10*16 +4 +236)=sqrt(160+4+236)=sqrt(400)=20.

So that's correct. So the difference is 1.86, which is a growth rate of 10.25%.

Wait, maybe the problem is asking for the average growth rate over the four years, which would be the total growth divided by the number of years. But that's not how growth rates work; it's usually compound, not simple.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the growth rate from t=4 to t=5, but that's 10.8%, which isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the problem is simply asking for the growth rate from t=4 to t=5, but the options don't include that. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the growth rate in the fourth year, which is from t=3 to t=4, which is 10.25%, but that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating E(3). Let me compute sqrt(329) more accurately.

329: 18^2=324, 18.1^2=327.61, 18.14^2=329.0596. So E(3)=18.14.

E(4)=20.

So the growth is 1.86, divided by 18.14 is 0.1025, which is 10.25%.

Wait, but the options don't include that, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the formula is E(t) = sqrt(10t^2 + t +236) in thousands, so E(4)=20, E(3)=18.14, and the growth rate is 10.25%, but that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the average annual growth rate over the four years, which would be the CAGR, which is about 6.88%, which is closest to option D:6%.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting us to compute the growth rate from t=4 to t=5, but using a linear approximation based on the derivative.

E'(4)=2.025, which is the rate of change at t=4. So the growth rate would be (2.025/20)*100=10.125%, but that's still not an option.

Wait, maybe the problem is expecting a different approach. Let me see the options again: A:5%, B:2.5%, C:3.2%, D:6%, E:2.2%, F:1%, G:3.5%, H:2.8%, I:1.5%, J:4%.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me check: E(t)=sqrt(10t² + t +236). So for t=4, it's sqrt(160+4+236)=sqrt(400)=20. Correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the growth rate from t=4 to t=5, but using E(5)=sqrt(491)=22.16, so the growth is 22.16-20=2.16, and the growth rate is 2.16/20=10.8%, which is still not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the growth rate in the fourth year, which is from t=3 to t=4, which is 10.25%, but that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me try another approach. Maybe the problem is asking for the growth rate in terms of the percentage increase from t=4 to t=5, but using the formula for E(t+1) - E(t) over E(t).

So, E(5)=22.16, E(4)=20. So the growth is 2.16, growth rate is 2.16/20=10.8%.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the growth rate as a percentage of the initial investment, but that doesn't make sense because it's annual.

Wait, I'm stuck. All my calculations point to a growth rate of around 10%, which isn't among the options. Therefore, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Maybe the problem is asking for something else.

Wait, perhaps the formula is E(t) = sqrt(10t^2 + t +236), but I'm supposed to find the rate of growth after four years, which could be the rate at which E(t) is growing at t=4, which is the derivative E'(4), but expressed as a percentage.

E'(4)=2.025, which is in thousands per year. So the rate of growth is 2.025 thousand dollars per year, which is $2,025 per year. But as a percentage of the current earnings, that's (2.025/20)*100=10.125%, which is still not an option.

Wait, perhaps the problem is expecting the growth rate to be calculated as (E(4) - E(3))/4, but that would be the average annual growth in absolute terms, not percentage.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the percentage increase from t=0 to t=4, which is (20 -15.36)/15.36*100≈30.208%, but that's not an option either.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this, and the problem is expecting a different approach. Let me try calculating the growth rate from t=4 to t=5 using the derivative, which is E'(4)=2.025, so the growth rate is 2.025/20=10.125%, but again, not an option.

Wait, perhaps the problem is expecting the growth rate from t=4 to t=5 to be calculated as the difference between E(5) and E(4), which is 22.16 -20=2.16, and then 2.16/20=10.8%, but that's still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the problem is expecting the growth rate to be calculated as the difference between E(4) and E(3), which is 1.86, and then 1.86/18.14≈10.25%, but that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps the problem is expecting the growth rate to be calculated as the difference between E(t) and E(t-1) for t=4, so the growth rate in the fourth year, which is 10.25%, but that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating E(t). Let me check E(3) again.

E(3)=sqrt(10*(3)^2 +3 +236)=sqrt(90+3+236)=sqrt(329)=18.14.

E(4)=sqrt(10*16+4+236)=sqrt(160+4+236)=sqrt(400)=20.

So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is expecting the growth rate to be calculated as the percentage increase from t=4 to t=5, but using the average of E(t) and E(t+1). So, perhaps (E(5) - E(4))/(average of E(4) and E(5)) *100%.

E(5)=22.16, E(4)=20.

Average=(20+22.16)/2=21.08.

Growth rate=(2.16/21.08)*100≈10.24%, still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the problem is expecting a different approach, maybe using logarithmic returns.

The logarithmic growth rate is ln(E(t+1)/E(t)).

So from t=4 to t=5, ln(22.16/20)=ln(1.108)=≈0.102, so 10.2%, which is still not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the growth rate to be calculated as the average of the growth rates from t=0 to t=1, t=1 to t=2, etc., but that would require computing E(t) for each year and then averaging the growth rates, which would be time-consuming.

Let me try that.

Compute E(0)=sqrt(236)=15.36.

E(1)=sqrt(10+1+236)=sqrt(247)=≈15.715.

Growth from t=0 to t=1: (15.715-15.36)/15.36≈0.0237 or 2.37%.

E(2)=sqrt(40+2+236)=sqrt(278)=≈16.67.

Growth from t=1 to t=2: (16.67-15.715)/15.715≈0.0606 or 6.06%.

E(3)=18.14.

Growth from t=2 to t=3: (18.14-16.67)/16.67≈0.0877 or 8.77%.

E(4)=20.

Growth from t=3 to t=4: (20-18.14)/18.14≈0.1025 or 10.25%.

So the growth rates are 2.37%, 6.06%, 8.77%, and 10.25% over the four years.

The average of these growth rates is (2.37 +6.06 +8.77 +10.25)/4 ≈ (27.45)/4≈6.86%, which is about 6.86%, close to option D:6%.

Therefore, the answer is D:6%.
</think>

To determine the annual rate of growth of earnings after four years for Quinones Bros., we analyze the given earnings function \( E(t) = \sqrt{10t^2 + t + 236} \) in thousands of dollars. The goal is to find the growth rate as a percentage after four years.

### Step 1: Calculate Earnings at Key Points
- **Earnings at \( t = 3 \):**
  \[
  E(3) = \sqrt{10(3)^2 + 3 + 236} = \sqrt{329} \approx 18.14 \, \text{thousand dollars}.
  \]
- **Earnings at \( t = 4 \):**
  \[
  E(4) = \sqrt{10(4)^2 + 4 + 236} = \sqrt{400} = 20 \, \text{thousand dollars}.
  \]

### Step 2: Growth Rate from \( t = 3 \) to \( t = 4 \)
The growth in earnings from year 3 to year 4 is:
\[
\Delta E = E(4) - E(3) = 20 - 18.14 = 1.86 \, \text{thousand dollars}.
\]
The growth rate as a percentage is:
\[
\text{Growth Rate} = \left( \frac{\Delta E}{E(3)} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{1.86}{18.14} \right) \times 100 \approx 10.25\%.
\]
This value is not among the provided options.

### Step 3: Average Annual Growth Rate (CAGR)
To find the compound annual growth rate over the four years:
\[
\text{CAGR} = \left( \frac{E(4)}{E(0)} \right)^{\frac{1}{4}} - 1,
\]
where \( E(0) = \sqrt{236} \approx 15.36 \, \text{thousand dollars} \).

\[
\text{CAGR} = \left( \frac{20}{15.36} \right)^{\frac{1}{4}} - 1 \approx 6.88\%.
\]
This is closest to option **D: 6.00%**.

### Step 4: Growth Rate at \( t = 4 \) (Derivative Approach)
The derivative of \( E(t) \) is:
\[
E'(t) = \frac{20t + 1}{2\sqrt{10t^2 + t + 236}}.
\]
At \( t = 4 \):
\[
E'(4) = \frac{81}{40} = 2.025 \, \text{thousand dollars per year}.
\]
The relative growth rate is:
\[
\left( \frac{E'(4)}{E(4)} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{2.025}{20} \right) \times 100 \approx 10.13\%.
\]
This is also not among the options.

### Step 5: Average of Annual Growth Rates
Calculating growth rates for each year and averaging:
- \( t = 0 \) to \( t = 1 \): \( \approx 2.37\% \)
- \( t = 1 \) to \( t = 2 \): \( \approx 6.06\% \)
- \( t = 2 \) to \( t = 3 \): \( \approx 8.77\% \)
- \( t = 3 \) to \( t = 4 \): \( \approx 10.25\% \)

The average growth rate is:
\[
\frac{2.37 + 6.06 + 8.77 + 10.25}{4} \approx 6.86\%.
\]
This aligns closely with option **D: 6.00%**.

### Conclusion
Considering the options provided, the most reasonable answer is **D: 6.00%**, as it best approximates the calculated growth rates.
