Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem about Florence Lesson's automobile expenses. Let me read the question carefully and think through it step by step.

Florence is a saleswoman who uses her own car for work. The company reimburses her 10 cents for every mile she drives. They also pay for parking and tolls. Last year, she drove 11,472 miles and spent $787.44 on parking and tolls. I need to find two things: (a) the total cost to the company for her automobile expenses, and (b) the average monthly cost.

Let me break this down. 

First, part (a). The company reimburses her 10 cents per mile. So for each mile she drives, they pay her $0.10. She drove 11,472 miles. So I need to calculate 11,472 multiplied by 0.10.

Let me do that calculation. 11,472 * 0.10 equals 1,147.20. So the reimbursement for mileage is $1,147.20.

Additionally, the company pays for parking and tolls, which amounted to $787.44. So the total cost to the company is the sum of these two amounts.

Adding them together: $1,147.20 + $787.44. Let's see, 1,147 + 787 is 1,934, and 0.20 + 0.44 is 0.64. So the total is $1,934.64. So part (a) is $1,934.64.

Now part (b). I need to find the average cost per month. There are 12 months in a year, so I'll take the total cost and divide it by 12.

Total cost is $1,934.64. Dividing that by 12: 1,934.64 ÷ 12. Let me compute that.

12 goes into 19 once (12), remainder 7. Bring down the 3: 73. 12*6=72, so 6 times, remainder 1. Bring down the 4: 14. 12 goes into 14 once, remainder 2. Bring down the 6: 26. 12*2=24, remainder 2. Bring down the 4: 24. 12*2=24, no remainder. Now, bring down the decimal point and the .64.

Wait, maybe it's easier to compute 1,934.64 ÷ 12.

Let me try another way: 12 * 161 = 1,932. Because 12*160=1,920, plus 12*1=12, so 1,932. Then 1,934.64 - 1,932 = 2.64. So 2.64 ÷ 12 = 0.22. So the total is 161 + 0.22 = 161.22.

So the average monthly cost is $161.22.

Now, looking at the options:

A: $1,934.64 and $161.22 → This matches what I calculated.

B: $787.44 and $65.62 → No, because part (a) is higher.

C: $1,934.64 and $787.44 → Part (b) is wrong.

D: $2,722.08 and $161.22 → Part (a) is wrong.

E: $1,147.20 and $95.60 → Part (a) is only mileage, but we have to add parking/tolls.

F: $2,722.08 and $226.84 → No, both parts wrong.

G: $787.44 and $161.22 → Part (a) wrong.

H: $1,147.20 and $161.22 → Part (a) only includes mileage, missing parking/tolls.

I: $1,934.64 and $95.60 → Part (b) wrong.

J: $1,147.20 and $65.62 → Both parts wrong.

So the correct answer is option A: $1,934.64 and $161.22.

The total cost to the company is the sum of mileage reimbursement ($1,147.20) and parking/tolls ($787.44), totaling $1,934.64. Dividing this by 12 months gives an average monthly cost of $161.22.
