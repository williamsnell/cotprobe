Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about regression models and R squared. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my statistics, but I'll try to recall what I know.

The question says that the R squared value for an estimated regression model is exactly zero. And we have four statements, i to iv, and we need to determine which are true.

First, I remember that R squared, or the coefficient of determination, measures the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that's predictable from the independent variables. So if R squared is zero, that means none of the variance in y is explained by the model. So that's statement iii: The regression line has not explained any of the variability of y about its mean value. That must be true because R squared is zero.

Now, what does that imply about the regression line itself? If the model isn't explaining any variability, it suggests that the line isn't doing anything beyond just the mean of y. So in a simple linear regression, the line would be horizontal, meaning it's just the average y value across all x. That would make the slope zero because there's no relationship. So statement ii says the fitted line is horizontal with respect to all explanatory variables. That seems true too.

Now, what about the coefficients? The slope coefficients being zero would mean that each x variable doesn't explain any part of y. So statement i: All coefficient estimates on the slopes will be zero. That makes sense because if the line is horizontal, there's no slope, so all the slope coefficients are zero.

Wait, but what about the intercept? The intercept is the value of y when all x variables are zero. If the regression line is just the mean of y, then the intercept would be equal to the mean of y, not necessarily zero. So statement iv says the intercept coefficient must be zero. That's not necessarily true. For example, if y has a mean of 5, the intercept would be 5, not zero. So iv is false.

So summarizing:
i) True (all slopes zero)
ii) True (fitted line is horizontal, slope zero)
iii) True (no variability explained)
iv) False (intercept isn't necessarily zero)

Looking at the options, which include these?

Option J is (i), (ii), and (iii) only. That matches our assessment. Option E is (ii) and (iii) only, but it's missing i which is true, so E is wrong. Option J includes all three correct statements.

The correct answer is J: (i), (ii), and (iii) only.

Answer: J
