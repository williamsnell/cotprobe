Okay, so I've got this question about an electric heater's power rating. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my electricity formulas, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

Alright, the question says the heater takes 4 amperes from a 120-volt line. I remember that power, voltage, and current are related somehow. Oh right, the formula for power is P = V × I. That's volts multiplied by amps. So in this case, the voltage is 120 volts and the current is 4 amps.

Let me write that down: P = 120 V × 4 A. Doing the math, 120 times 4 is... 480. So the power should be 480 watts. Looking at the options, choice D is 480 watts. That seems straightforward.

Wait, but sometimes I get confused between watts and other units. Let me double-check. Oh, voltage is in volts, current in amps, and their product gives watts. Yep, that's right. So 120 ×4 is definitely 480. I don't think there's any other consideration here, like power factor or anything because the question doesn't mention it. It's just a straightforward calculation.

So the answer should be D: 480 watts.

The power rating of the heater is calculated using the formula \( P = V \times I \), where \( V = 120 \) volts and \( I = 4 \) amperes. Multiplying these values gives \( 120 \times 4 = 480 \) watts. 

Answer: D
