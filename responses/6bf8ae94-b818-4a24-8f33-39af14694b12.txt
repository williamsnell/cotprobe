Okay, so I have this math problem here, and I need to figure out which expression is another way to show 8 multiplied by 6. The options are A through E, and I need to pick the correct one. Let me think this through step by step.

First, I know that 8 x 6 equals 48. So whatever expression I choose, it should also equal 48 when evaluated. Let's look at each option one by one.

Option A is (2x4)x6. Let me compute that. 2 multiplied by 4 is 8, and then 8 multiplied by 6 is 48. So that works out to 48. Hmm, that's correct. But I should check the other options too to make sure there's not a better fit.

Option B is (24+4)+6. Let's add those up. 24 plus 4 is 28, and then adding 6 gives me 34. That's not 48, so B is out.

Option C is (2+4)x6. Adding 2 and 4 gives me 6, and then 6 multiplied by 6 is 36. That's not 48 either, so C isn't the right answer.

Option D is (2x4) + 6. 2 times 4 is 8, and adding 6 gives me 14. That's way off, so D is incorrect.

Option E is (16+16). Adding 16 and 16 gives me 32, which isn't 48. So E is also wrong.

Wait, but looking back, option A gives me 48, which matches 8x6. But let me think again. The question is asking for another way to show 8x6. So maybe there's a way to break down 8 into smaller numbers and then apply the multiplication property, like associativity or distributivity.

Wait, 8 can be written as 2x4 because 2 times 4 is 8. So if I have (2x4)x6, that's the same as 8x6. Alternatively, using the associative property of multiplication, the way I group the numbers doesn't change the product. So (2x4)x6 is indeed equal to 8x6, which is 48.

Let me double-check the other options just to be sure. Option C was (2+4)x6, which is 6x6=36. That's different. Option E is 16+16=32, which is also not 48. So the only correct one is A.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. There's another way to think about 8x6. Maybe using distributive property. Like, 8 is 5+3, so 5x6 +3x6 would be 30+18=48. But that's not one of the options. Alternatively, 8 is 10-2, so (10-2)x6=60-12=48. But again, that's not an option here.

Looking back, option A is (2x4)x6, which is exactly 8x6 because 2x4 is 8. So yeah, A is the correct answer. The other options don't compute to 48, so I'm confident that A is the right choice.

The correct answer is A: (2x4)x6, as it equals 8x6=48.
