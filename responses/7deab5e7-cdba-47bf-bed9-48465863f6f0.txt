Okay, so I have this question about light and prisms. Let me think through it carefully. The question is: "When white light enters a prism, green light is bent more than..." and then there are several options.

I remember from my classes that when white light passes through a prism, it bends and splits into different colors. This is called dispersion. Each color bends at a slightly different angle because they have different wavelengths. I think the colors with shorter wavelengths bend more than the ones with longer wavelengths.

Wait, the order of the colors from shortest to longest wavelength is violet, blue, green, yellow, orange, red. So violet bends the most, then blue, then green, and so on until red, which bends the least. So green is somewhere in the middle, but it bends more than the colors that come after it in that order.

The question says green is bent more than which color. So looking at the options, the answer should be a color that has a longer wavelength than green. So from the list, after green comes yellow, orange, and red.

Looking at the options: option H is red light, E is yellow, B is orange. So green bends more than yellow, orange, and red. The question is asking which one green is bent more than. So the correct answer would be one of those.

Wait, but the options are phrased as "green light is bent more than". So the options are A to J, and the correct answer would be one of the longer wavelength colors. Let's see the options:

A: brown light. Hmm, wait, brown isn't one of the visible colors. So maybe that's not correct.

B: orange light. Orange is longer wavelength than green, so green bends more than orange.

C: indigo light. Indigo is a color between blue and violet, so shorter wavelength than green? No, because green is after blue. Wait, no, the order is violet, blue, green, yellow... So green is after blue. So indigo is maybe between blue and green? Wait, I'm a bit confused. Wait, Newton included indigo as a separate color between blue and green, but in some modern models, it's grouped with blue. But in terms of wavelength, green is longer than blue and violet, so indigo would be closer to blue. So green would bend more than indigo? Or not?

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me clarify: the order in terms of wavelength from shortest to longest is violet, blue, green, yellow, orange, red. So green is longer than blue and violet, shorter than yellow, orange, red. So any color after green in this order would have a longer wavelength, so green would bend more than those.

So the question is, when white light enters a prism, green is bent more than which color. So the answer would be a color that has a longer wavelength than green, meaning it's a color that comes after green in the order. So options E (yellow), B (orange), H (red) are possibilities.

Looking back at the options, the choices are A: brown (not a color), B: orange, C: indigo, D: blue, E: yellow, F: violet, G: none, H: red, I: all equal, J: black light (not visible).

So the question is, green is bent more than which of these. So the options that have longer wavelengths than green are yellow, orange, red.

So the correct answer would be one of these. The options are presented as possible choices, so the answer should be either B, E, or H.

Wait, the question is phrased as "green light is bent more than", so we're looking for a color that is less bent than green, meaning it has a longer wavelength. So the answer should be a color with longer wavelength than green, so the ones after green.

So the options are B: orange, E: yellow, H: red.

But wait, the question is asking which color green is bent more than. So the correct answer is any color that is less bent than green, which would be those with longer wavelengths.

So the options are B, E, H. Now, the question is which one is the correct answer.

Wait, but the options are presented as the possible choices. So the question is, which of these is a color that green is bent more than.

So the correct answer would be, for example, red light. Because red has a longer wavelength than green, so it bends less.

But wait, the options are presented as "green is bent more than...", so the answer would be any color that comes after green in the order.

So the options are B: orange, E: yellow, H: red.

In the options, the possible correct answers are B, E, H.

Wait, but let me think again. The question is, when white light enters a prism, green is bent more than which color? So the correct answer would be a color that is less bent than green, which would be a color with a longer wavelength.

So the answer is one of the options where the color has a longer wavelength than green, meaning it's yellow, orange, or red.

So looking at the options, the correct answer is either E, B, or H.

Wait, but the options are given as A to J, and the question is which one is correct.

Wait, but the options are A: brown, B: orange, C: indigo, D: blue, E: yellow, F: violet, G: none, H: red, I: all equal, J: black.

So the correct answer is one of B, E, H.

Now, the question is, which one is correct. The options are specific, so perhaps the intended answer is red, because red is the least bent. But I'm not sure.

Wait, the question is when white light enters a prism, green is bent more than... So the correct answer is a color that is less bent than green, which would be a color that comes after green in the order.

So the options are E (yellow), B (orange), H (red). So the answer would be one of these.

But the options don't have all three, so the question is which one is correct. The possible answers are E, B, H.

Wait, perhaps the intended answer is red, because red is the least bent. So the correct answer is H: red light.

Alternatively, if the question is about which color is bent less than green, then the answer would be red.

So the correct answer is H: red light.

When white light enters a prism, it undergoes dispersion, where colors bend at different angles due to their varying wavelengths. Colors with shorter wavelengths bend more than those with longer wavelengths. The order of wavelengths from shortest to longest is violet, blue, green, yellow, orange, and red. Therefore, green light bends more than yellow, orange, and red light.

Among the options provided, red light (H) has the longest wavelength and bends the least. Thus, green light is bent more than red light.

Answer: H
