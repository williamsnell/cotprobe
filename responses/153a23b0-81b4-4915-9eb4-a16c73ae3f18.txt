Okay, so I've got this question about logic arguments, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is: "The minor premise must affirm the antecedent or deny the consequent" is a way to determine the validity of which type of argument? The options are from A to J.

Hmm, I remember from my logic class that there are different types of arguments, like deductive, inductive, hypothetical syllogisms, categorical syllogisms, and so on. The key part here is the minor premise needing to affirm the antecedent or deny the consequent. 

Wait, what's a syllogism? Oh right, a syllogism is a form of reasoning with two premises and a conclusion. There are categorical syllogisms, which deal with categories, and hypothetical syllogisms, which involve conditional statements or hypotheses.

In a hypothetical syllogism, the structure is usually an if-then statement. So, the major premise might be something like "If P, then Q." Then the minor premise could either affirm P (the antecedent) or deny Q (the consequent). 

If the minor premise affirms the antecedent (P is true), then the conclusion would be that Q must follow. That's called modus ponens. On the other hand, if the minor premise denies the consequent (Q is false), then the conclusion is that P must be false. That's modus tollens.

So the rule about the minor premise affirming the antecedent or denying the consequent applies to hypothetical syllogisms. These are the two valid forms of reasoning in this type of argument.

Looking at the options, I see option I is Hypothetical syllogism. So that must be the answer.

Wait, let me make sure. The other options: Red herring is a distraction, ad hominem is attacking the person, deductive is broader, categorical syllogism deals with categories, disjunctive is about 'either-or' statements, inductive is about probability, analogical uses analogy, slippery slope is a sequence of small steps leading to a larger problem, and Toulmin model is a different framework.

Yes, so the answer should be I: Hypothetical syllogism.

The correct answer is I: Hypothetical syllogism.
