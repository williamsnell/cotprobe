Okay, so I have this Python question here, and I need to figure it out. The question is about what the output of the statement "a" + "ab" would be in Python 3. The options are from A to J, and I need to choose the correct one.

Hmm, let's think. I remember that in Python, when you use the plus operator with strings, it concatenates them. So if you add two strings, it just puts them together. So "a" plus "ab" should be "aab", right? Because "a" followed by "ab" makes "aab".

Wait, but let me double-check. I think in Python 3, the plus operator for strings does exactly that. So for example, "a" + "b" would be "ab", and "a" + "ab" would be "aab". 

Looking at the options, option B is "aab". So that should be the correct answer. Let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Oh, the options are labeled A to J, so I should check each one. 

Option A is "aaab"—that's four letters, which doesn't make sense because "a" has one and "ab" has two, so total should be three. Option B is "aab"—yes, that's three letters. Option C is the expression itself, but the question is about the output, not the code. So C isn't right. Option D is "aba", which would be if we added "a" and "ba", but that's not the case here. Option E is "ab", which is shorter than the result, so that's wrong. Option F is "abab"—that's adding "a" and "bab", which isn't the case. Option G is "a ab" which would require a space, but the plus doesn't add spaces. Option H is "a+ab", which is just the string of the operator, not the result. Option I says error, but since both are strings, adding them should work, not cause an error. Option J is "a aab", which again, would require a space or another operator.

So, putting it all together, the correct output should be "aab", which is option B.

The statement "a" + "ab" in Python 3 concatenates the two strings, resulting in "aab". 

Answer: B
