Okay, so I've got this question about absorption rates when the pressure is increased from 1 atm to 3 atm in two different scenarios. I'm a bit rusty on my absorption kinetics, but let me try to think this through step by step.

First, the question is about the effect on the absorption rate when pressure increases. The absorption rate depends on the mechanism controlling the process. If the process is gas-film controlled, then pressure changes might have a different effect compared to liquid-film controlled cases.

Let's break down the two cases:

**Case I:** Absorption of methane from an air-methane mixture (15% CH4 by volume) into pure water. The gas film offers the main resistance. So, the limiting step is the diffusion through the gas phase.

In gas-film controlled absorption, the rate is proportional to the partial pressure of the gas. Since the partial pressure of CH4 is 15% of the total pressure. If the total pressure increases from 1 atm to 3 atm, the partial pressure of CH4 becomes 0.15 * 3 atm = 0.45 atm. Originally, it was 0.15 atm. So the partial pressure increases by a factor of 3. 

Wait, but wait—the absorption rate is proportional to the partial pressure. So if the partial pressure triples, the rate should triple as well. So the absorption rate would increase by 200% (since 3 times the original is a 200% increase). But wait, the options don't seem to have that. Alternatively, maybe I should think in terms of the effect on the rate. Let me think again.

Alternatively, the rate equation for gas-film controlled is often given by: 

\[ \text{Rate} = k_{g} P_{CH4} \]

Where \( P_{CH4} \) is the partial pressure. So if \( P_{CH4} \) increases from 0.15 atm to 0.45 atm, the rate increases by a factor of 3. So the absorption rate increases by 200%, meaning a 300% of the original rate? Or perhaps an increase of 200% (since 0.45 is 3 times 0.15, so 200% increase from 0.15 to 0.45). Hmm, but the options don't directly say that. Let me hold onto this thought and look at the second case.

**Case II:** Absorption of CH4 from a 25% CH4 by volume mixture into a solution where the vapor pressure of CH4 is 0.17 atm. I think this case is liquid-film controlled, or maybe it's more about the equilibrium in the liquid phase.

Wait, the vapor pressure of methane over the solution is 0.17 atm. That suggests that the solution's ability to absorb more methane depends on the partial pressure of CH4 in the gas phase relative to the solution's vapor pressure.

In this case, the absorption rate is probably limited by the liquid film. The rate expression for liquid-film controlled absorption is often:

\[ \text{Rate} = k_{L} (P_{CH4} - P_{vap}) \]

But wait, if the vapor pressure of the solution is higher than the partial pressure in the gas, the rate would decrease because the driving force is reduced. Alternatively, if the partial pressure is higher than the vapor pressure, the driving force is the difference.

Wait, in Case II, the total pressure is increased, but the vapor pressure over the solution is fixed at 0.17 atm. Let's compute the partial pressure of CH4 in the gas phase when total pressure is 1 atm and 3 atm.

At 1 atm total pressure, the partial pressure of CH4 is 25% of 1 atm = 0.25 atm. The vapor pressure is 0.17 atm. So the driving force is 0.25 - 0.17 = 0.08 atm.

At 3 atm, the partial pressure becomes 0.75 atm (25% of 3). So driving force is 0.75 - 0.17 = 0.58 atm.

So the driving force increases. But wait, if the rate is proportional to the driving force (the difference), then increasing the driving force should increase the absorption rate. But wait, in the case of liquid-film control, the rate is typically proportional to (P - P_vapor), so higher (P - P_vapor) would mean higher rate. So in this case, raising pressure increases the driving force, so rate increases.

Wait, but another angle: if the solution's vapor pressure is fixed, then when the gas partial pressure increases beyond that, the driving force is higher, which would increase the rate. So in Case II, the absorption rate would increase because the driving force (P - P_vapor) increases.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, if the system is under conditions where the solution is almost saturated, perhaps the rate could be affected differently. But I think in this case, the driving force is positive and increases, so the rate increases.

Wait, but let's think again: the absorption rate in the liquid-film controlled case is proportional to (P_ch4 - P_vapor). So when pressure increases, P_ch4 increases, so (P_ch4 - P_vapor) increases, leading to a higher rate. So in Case II, the rate increases.

Wait, but wait a second. Another possibility is that the solution's vapor pressure is already higher than the gas phase's partial pressure at 1 atm. Let me check: at 1 atm, P_ch4 is 0.25 atm, and the solution's vapor pressure is 0.17 atm. So 0.25 > 0.17, so driving force is positive. At higher pressure, P_ch4 is higher, so driving force is higher, so rate increases.

So for Case I: gas-film controlled, rate increases by a factor of 3 (since P increases by 3x). So rate increases by 200% (because 3x is a 200% increase from original). So absorption rate increases by 200% in Case I.

In Case II: the driving force increases, leading to higher absorption rate. So in both cases, the rate increases.

Wait, but looking at the options, let's see:

Option B says "Pressure change increases the absorption rate in both cases." So that would be correct.

But wait, let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in Case I. Because sometimes, the overall process could be limited by the solvent's ability to dissolve, but in Case I, it's pure water. So in Case I, since it's gas-film controlled, the rate depends directly on the partial pressure, so higher pressure increases the rate.

Wait, but perhaps I'm confusing the effect of pressure on the overall mass transfer coefficient. In reality, for a gas-phase reaction, increasing the total pressure can affect the partial pressures. But in this case, the process is gas-film controlled, so the rate is proportional to the partial pressure of CH4.

So in Case I, the rate increases when pressure increases because the partial pressure of CH4 increases. So in Case I, the absorption rate increases.

In Case II, the driving force increases, so the absorption rate also increases. So both cases see an increase in absorption rate when pressure is increased.

Wait, but looking at the options, option B says both cases increase. But let me check the options again.

Looking at the options, option B is "Pressure change increases the absorption rate in both cases." So that would fit.

Wait, but I should double-check. Let me think about Case II again. The vapor pressure of the solution is 0.17 atm. When the gas's partial pressure of CH4 is higher than that, the absorption will continue until equilibrium. So if the partial pressure increases, the driving force increases, so the rate should increase.

Alternatively, perhaps the rate is also influenced by the fact that the solution's concentration affects the vapor pressure. But in this case, the vapor pressure is given as a fixed 0.17 atm, so I think the analysis holds.

So I think option B is correct: pressure change increases absorption rate in both cases.

The effect of increasing the total pressure from 1 atm to 3 atm on the absorption rate is analyzed for two cases:

**Case I:** Absorption of methane from an air-methane mixture (15% CH₄ by volume) into pure water, where the gas film is the main resistance. Since the process is gas-film controlled, the absorption rate is proportional to the partial pressure of CH₄. At 1 atm, the partial pressure of CH₄ is 0.15 atm, and at 3 atm, it becomes 0.45 atm. This tripling of the partial pressure leads to a 200% increase in the absorption rate.

**Case II:** Absorption of methane from a 25% CH₄ by volume mixture into a solution with a vapor pressure of 0.17 atm. The absorption rate is proportional to the driving force, \( P_{\text{CH4}} - P_{\text{vap}} \). At 1 atm, the partial pressure of CH₄ is 0.25 atm, giving a driving force of 0.08 atm. At 3 atm, the partial pressure increases to 0.75 atm, resulting in a driving force of 0.58 atm. The increased driving force leads to a higher absorption rate.

In both cases, the absorption rate increases with the pressure change. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**B: Pressure change increases the absorption rate in both cases.**
