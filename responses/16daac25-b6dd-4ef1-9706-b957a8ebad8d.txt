Question:

A bank was robbed by a person wearing a yellow ski mask, goggles, and a fluorescent yellow jumpsuit. Three weeks after the robbery, a defendant was arrested and charged with the crime. At trial, the prosecuting attorney seeks to introduce evidence that the defendant had previously committed a robbery wearing a yellow ski mask, goggles, and a fluorescent yellow jumpsuit. Upon objection by the defendant's attorney, the proffered evidence should be

Options:

A: inadmissible, because it is hearsay evidence.
B: admissible as circumstantial evidence that the defendant committed the crime as charged.
C: inadmissible, because it constitutes double jeopardy.
D: inadmissible, because it is irrelevant to the case.
E: admissible, to show the identity of the defendant.
F: admissible, to show the defendant's propensity for committing similar crimes.
G: admissible, to show the defendant's modus operandi.
H: admissible, to show the defendant's motive.
I: inadmissible, because the probative value of the evidence is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.
J: inadmissible, because it constitutes improper character evidence.

Okay, so I've got this question about evidence law in a criminal trial. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The scenario is a bank robbery case. The defendant is on trial, and the prosecution wants to introduce evidence about a previous robbery he committed using the same outfit: yellow ski mask, goggles, and fluorescent yellow jumpsuit. The defense is objecting, so the question is whether this evidence should be admitted.

I remember that in criminal trials, evidence of prior crimes can sometimes be admitted for certain purposes, but not just to show that the defendant has a bad character and is more likely to have committed the crime. There are specific exceptions to the rule against using prior bad acts as character evidence.

First, I need to recall the rules about hearsay. Hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted, and it's generally inadmissible. But in this case, I don't think the issue is hearsay because the evidence here is about what the defendant did in a prior robbery, which would be non-hearsay. So option A might not be correct.

Next, double jeopardy. That's when someone is tried twice for the same offense. But here, the prosecution is introducing evidence of a different robbery, so double jeopardy isn't the issue. So option C is probably out.

Relevant evidence is evidence that has a tendency to make a fact of consequence more or less probable. The fact here is whether the defendant committed the bank robbery charged. The previous robbery involved the same exact getup, which could suggest that the defendant has a pattern or modus operandi. So it might be relevant. That would make options D and H less likely, unless the relevance is outweighed by other factors.

Now, the key here is the purpose for which the evidence is being introduced. If it's to show that the defendant committed the crime because he has a propensity to commit such crimes, that's impermissible. But if it's to show modus operandi or identity, that might be allowed. 

Modus operandi refers to a distinct method or pattern of committing crimes. If the defendant has a habit of using the same outfit, that could help link him to the crime in question. So the evidence might be admissible under the modus operandi exception. That would point towards option G.

But wait, another thought: sometimes evidence of prior crimes can be used to show identity. If the method of committing the crime is unique, it can help establish that the same person did both crimes. So maybe it's admissible under the identity exception as well. That would be option E.

But wait, the Federal Rules of Evidence (FRE) say that evidence of other crimes is admissible for certain purposes, like proving identity, modus operandi, or when the prior crime is so distinctive that it's like a signature. So in this case, the same outfit is distinctive, so it's more about modus operandi or identity.

However, the main issue is whether it's being used for an improper purpose. If the prosecution is introducing it to show that the defendant has a propensity to commit such crimes, that's not allowed. But if it's being used to show that the defendant is likely the one who committed the crime because he used the same method, then it's admissible.

So, looking at the options, E says "admissible to show the identity of the defendant." G says "admissible to show the defendant's modus operandi." Both could be correct, but the question is which one applies here.

In this case, the evidence is about the same exact clothing used in both robberies. This suggests a method or pattern, so modus operandi would be the better fit. Therefore, option G is correct.

Wait, but sometimes identity is a subset of modus operandi. Or maybe they're considered together. Alternatively, the evidence could be used under either theory. But in the options, E and G are separate. So which one is more appropriate?

The question is whether the evidence is admissible. Since the evidence is about the defendant's method of committing crimes, modus operandi would be the applicable exception. So the correct answer would be G.

But wait another point: sometimes the court requires that the prior act be similar enough and that it's being used to show a pattern. Given that the clothing is identical, it's a strong case for modus operandi.

Alternatively, if the prior act is being used to show that the defendant is the same person because only he would use that method, that's identity. So both E and G could be possible, but in the options, G is about modus operandi, which is a specific term, and E is more general identity.

I think the correct answer is E because the evidence is to show that the defendant is the one who committed the crime because he used the same method, thus proving identity. But modus operandi is more about the method itself, not necessarily the identity. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, let me think again. Modus operandi is about the method used, which can help establish identity because a unique method implies the same person. So in this case, the evidence is about the method, so it's modus operandi. So G would be correct.

Wait, but I've also heard that when the prior act is so similar, it can be used to show identity. So perhaps E is correct. I'm a bit torn between E and G.

Looking at the options again, E is about identity, G about modus operandi. The question is whether the evidence is admissible. So in this case, the evidence is being used to show that the defendant is the same person because he used the same method. Therefore, it's being used to establish identity, which would make E correct.

Alternatively, modus operandi is about the method itself, which can also help in establishing identity. So maybe both E and G could apply, but in the options, E and G are separate.

I think the better answer is E because the primary purpose is to show that the defendant is the one who committed the crime, i.e., identity. So the evidence is admissible for that purpose.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. I think I need to check the rules again. Under FRE 404(b), evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is admissible if it's relevant to an issue in the case, including proving identity. So yes, E is correct.

Wait, but in the question, the evidence is about a previous robbery with the same characteristics. So the prosecution is using it to show that the defendant is the one who did the current robbery because he did a similar one before. That's identity. So E is the correct answer.

But I'm a bit confused because I've heard that modus operandi is also a valid reason. Maybe I should think about the options again.

Option E: admissible to show identity. Option G: admissible to show modus operandi. Both could be correct, but the question is about whether the evidence is admissible. The rules allow for either purpose if it's relevant and not being used for propensity.

Since the evidence is about the same method, it's more about modus operandi, but it also helps in proving identity. So perhaps G is the better answer.

Wait, but in the question, the prosecution is charging the defendant for the current robbery. The evidence of the prior robbery is being used to show that the defendant is the one who did it because he used the same method. That's identity, so E would be the reason.

Alternatively, the same method could indicate modus operandi, which is a way of doing things that the defendant has a habit of. So G could also be correct.

I think the correct answer is E because the primary purpose is to show that the defendant is the one who did it, which is identity. So the evidence is admissible for that purpose.

Wait, but in the options, E is about identity, and G is about modus operandi. So which one is it?

I think I need to remember that modus operandi is a form of circumstantial evidence that can help establish identity because a unique method implies the same person. So the evidence is admissible under either theory, but the options are separate. So the correct answer would be E and G, but since the options are separate, perhaps G is more specific.

Alternatively, the correct answer is E because it's about identity.

Wait, but in the scenario, the defendant is already charged with the current robbery. The evidence of the prior robbery is being used to show that the defendant is the same person, i.e., identity. So E is correct.

But I'm still a bit confused. Maybe I should look at the options again. Option E says "admissible to show the identity of the defendant." Option G says "admissible to show the defendant's modus operandi."

In this case, the evidence is about the same method, which is modus operandi. So the correct answer is G.

Wait, but the primary purpose is to show identity. So E is correct.

I think I'm overcomplicating this. The correct answer is E because the evidence is about the same method used in both robberies, which helps establish that the defendant is the same person who committed the crime. So E is correct.

The question revolves around whether evidence of a defendant's prior robbery, involving the same distinctive outfit, is admissible in a subsequent robbery trial. The key issue is the purpose for which the evidence is being introduced. 

Under the Federal Rules of Evidence, evidence of prior crimes can be admissible if it is relevant to an issue in the case, such as proving identity or establishing modus operandi. In this scenario, the evidence of the prior robbery is being used to show that the defendant is the same person who committed the charged crime due to the unique method (distinctive clothing) employed in both robberies. This aligns with the purpose of proving identity, as the evidence links the defendant to the crime through a distinctive pattern or method.

While modus operandi refers to a specific method or pattern of committing crimes, the primary purpose here is to establish that the defendant is the one who committed the crime, which falls under the category of identity. Therefore, the evidence is admissible to show the identity of the defendant.
