Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about cyanobacteria and green unicellular algae. I'm a bit rusty on my biology, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking how cyanobacteria differ from green unicellular algae. The options are A through H. Let's break down each option to see which makes sense.

First, I remember that both cyanobacteria and green algae are photosynthetic, meaning they can make their own food using sunlight. But I think they belong to different kingdoms. Cyanobacteria are prokaryotes, right? That means their cells don't have a nucleus or membrane-bound organelles. So they don't have a nucleus with a membrane, whereas eukaryotes like green algae do.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Cyanobacteria reduce sulfur compounds. Hmm, I'm not too sure about this. I know that some bacteria can reduce sulfur, but I don't know if that's a key difference between them and green algae. Maybe not the main point here.

Option B: Cyanobacteria have no nuclei. Wait, I just thought about that. Cyanobacteria are prokaryotes, so they don't have a nucleus. Green algae are eukaryotes, so they do have nuclei. That seems like a big difference. So B could be correct.

Option C: Green algae cannot reduce nitrogen compounds. I'm not sure about this. I think both can fix nitrogen, but maybe some can and some can't. Not sure if that's a distinguishing factor here.

Option D: Green algae cannot photosynthesize. No, that's not right. Green algae definitely photosynthesize, that's why they are green and have chlorophyll.

Option E: Green algae produce cell membranes. Well, all cells have cell membranes, so this doesn't make sense as a difference.

Option F: Green algae have no chlorophyll. That can't be right because they are called green algae because they have chlorophyll, which gives them their green color.

Option G: Cyanobacteria lack cell walls. No, I believe both have cell walls. In fact, bacteria and algae both have cell walls, but their composition might differ. Cyanobacteria have peptidoglycan, while algae have cellulose, but the presence of a cell wall is there in both.

Option H: Cyanobacteria can photosynthesize. Wait, I thought they can. They have structures called chlorophyll and phycobilins, so they can photosynthesize. But green algae can too. So H is correct as a fact, but does it make them different? No, because both can photosynthesize. The question is about how they differ, so H isn't the answer.

So going back, the main difference is that cyanobacteria are prokaryotic and lack a nucleus, while green algae are eukaryotic and have a nucleus. So option B looks correct.

The main difference between cyanobacteria and green unicellular algae is that cyanobacteria are prokaryotes, meaning they lack a nucleus, while green algae are eukaryotes and have a nucleus. 

Answer: B
