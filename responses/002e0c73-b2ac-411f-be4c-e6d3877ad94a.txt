Question:

Osgood is the record owner of Desertacre, a 100- acre tract of farmland in California's Coachella Valley. Osgood inherited the property from his father and farmed the land until 2006, when he reached the age of 70. He then decided to retire and move to Scottsdale, Arizona. At that time, Osgood conveyed Desertacre to Cutler "for his use during his natural life. "After taking possession of the property, Cutler executed a mortgage on Desertacre in the amount of $100,000. In 2009, Osgood died and in his will, the testator devised Desertacre to his son, Desmond, with remainder to Deirdre. The will provided that Desmond and Deirdre took Desertacre "subject to Cutler's mortgage. "At the time of Osgood's death, Desertacre had a market value of $300,000. When Desmond learned of the devise, he was hesitant about taking title to Desertacre because he did not want to incur any indebtedness. Assume that Culter is still alive and in possession of the tract. With respect to the mortgage, Desmond will be

Options:

A: liable for the mortgage, because he is the devisee under the terms of Osgood's will.
B: liable for the mortgage, because the property was devised subject to the mortgage.
C: not liable, because there was no assumption of the mortgage.
D: not liable, because he did not personally grant the mortgage.

Okay, so I have this question about property law, specifically dealing with wills and mortgages. Let me try to break it down step by step.

Alright, so Osgood inherited Desertacre and farmed it until 2006 when he retired. Then he conveyed the property to Cutler "for his use during his natural life." Hmm, that sounds like a life estate. So Cutler has a life estate, meaning he has the right to use the property as long as he lives, but doesn't own it in fee simple.

Then, Cutler took possession and got a mortgage of $100k on the property. So the mortgage is on Desertacre, which at the time of Osgood's death in 2009 had a market value of $300k. Now, Osgood's will devises Desertacre to his son Desmond, with remainder to Deirdre. The will says Desmond and Deirdre take it "subject to Cutler's mortgage."

Desmond is worried about taking on the mortgage debt. The question is whether Desmond is liable for that mortgage.

I remember that in property law, when someone conveys a life estate, the life tenant (Cutler here) can mortgage the property, but that mortgage doesn't bind the remaindermen. The remaindermen are the ones who get the property after the life estate ends. So when Osgood conveyed the property to Cutler for his life, and then devised it to Desmond with a remainder to Deirdre, the mortgage by Cutler would typically be a lien on the property that the remaindermen would have to deal with.

But in this case, the will says the devise is "subject to Cutler's mortgage." I think that language is important. If the will devises the property subject to the mortgage, that would mean that when Desmond takes over, the mortgage is still attached. But does that make Desmond liable for it?

Wait, in general, unless the mortgage is specifically assumed by the grantee, the remaindermen aren't liable. But here, the will's language includes the mortgage as a burden on the property. So when Desmond takes the property, he takes it subject to the mortgage, meaning he would be responsible for it, right? Because the mortgage is part of the property's encumbrances.

But wait another thought: when a life estate is created, the life tenant can mortgage their interest, but the mortgage only affects the life estate. The remaindermen's interest is subject to the life estate but not the mortgage unless the will specifies. But here, the will says Desmond takes it subject to the mortgage, which might mean that the mortgage is treated as a charge on the future interest.

Alternatively, the mortgage was taken by Cutler, the life tenant, and typically, the life tenant can mortgage their interest. The mortgagee (the lender) can foreclose if the life tenant defaults, but the property would go to the life tenant's estate, not the remaindermen. But if the will says the devise is subject to the mortgage, maybe it's treated as an encumbrance that the remaindermen take subject to.

Wait, but when the life tenant mortgages, the mortgage is only on the life estate. So if the life tenant dies, the mortgage would be extinguished because the life estate ends. But in this case, Cutler is still alive. So if the will says Desmond takes subject to the mortgage, does that mean Desmond is on the hook for it?

Alternatively, when the life estate ends, the property goes to the remaindermen. If there's a mortgage on the life estate, typically the remaindermen aren't liable because the life estate doesn't pass the debt. But if the will says the property is devised subject to the mortgage, perhaps it's treated as a charge that the remaindermen must pay off when they take possession.

Wait, but in this case, Osgood conveyed the property to Cutler for his life, then in the will, Osgood's devise to Desmond is subject to Cutler's mortgage. So Osgood is the one who conveyed the life estate to Cutler. Now, in the will, Osgood is devising his remaining interest (if any) to Desmond, but the life estate was already given to Cutler. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, Osgood conveyed the property to Cutler for his life. So Osgood no longer owned the property; he gave it away. Then, in his will, he tries to devise Desertacre to Desmond. But if he no longer owned it, can he devise it? That seems like a problem. Wait, maybe the conveyance to Cutler was a life estate, and Osgood retained the remainder. So Osgood had a life estate, but no, he conveyed it to Cutler for life, then perhaps he had a remainder? Or maybe Osgood's conveyance to Cutler was a life estate, and Osgood retained nothing, so he couldn't devise.

Wait, that seems contradictory. Let me re-examine. Osgood inherited the property and farmed it until 2006. Then he conveyed it to Cutler "for his use during his natural life." So that's a conveyance of a life estate to Cutler, meaning Osgood gave Cutler a life estate, and Osgood either retained a remainder or the reversion.

Wait, if Osgood conveyed it to Cutler for his life, that might mean Osgood is the grantor, and Cutler has a life estate, and Osgood retains the future interestâ€”either a remainder or a reversion.

But then, in Osgood's will, he devises Desertacre to Desmond with remainder to Deirdre. So if Osgood had a future interest (like a remainder), he could devise that. But if he conveyed it all to Cutler for life, he wouldn't have anything left to devise. So perhaps the conveyance to Cutler was a life estate, and Osgood retained the reversion, which he then devised in his will.

Wait, that makes sense. So Osgood conveys a life estate to Cutler, and Osgood keeps the reversion. Then, in his will, he devises the reversion to Desmond, with remainder to Deirdre. So when Osgood dies, Cutler still has the life estate, and the reversion goes to Desmond, with the remainder to Deirdre after Desmond.

But the will says that Desmond and Deirdre take it "subject to Cutler's mortgage." So the reversion is subject to the mortgage. But what does that mean? The mortgage was taken by Cutler on his life estate.

In general, if a life tenant mortgages their interest, the mortgagee can foreclose, but the proceeds would go to satisfy the mortgage, and any surplus would go to the life tenant's estate. But the remaindermen aren't liable for the life tenant's debts unless they specifically assume them.

But in this case, the will says the reversion is subject to the mortgage. So when Desmond takes the reversion, he takes it subject to the mortgage, meaning he's responsible for paying it off when he gets the property. Or does it mean that the mortgage is an encumbrance on the property, and Desmond has to pay it when he takes over?

Wait, but the mortgage was taken by Cutler, the life tenant. So the mortgage is on the life estate. If Cutler dies, the life estate ends, and the mortgage would go with the life estate, meaning the lender can't foreclose because the life estate has ended. But here, Cutler is still alive, so he's the one making the payments.

Wait, but if the will says Desmond takes subject to the mortgage, does that mean Desmond is on the hook for the mortgage payments? Or does it just mean that the property is encumbered, and when the life estate ends, the mortgage is extinguished?

I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about the rules. A life tenant can mortgage their interest, but the mortgage doesn't bind the remaindermen. The mortgage is only on the life estate. So if the life tenant defaults, the lender can foreclose, but the proceeds would go to satisfy the mortgage, and any surplus would go to the life tenant's estate, not the remaindermen. So the remaindermen don't have to pay the mortgage unless the will says they do.

In this case, the will says Desmond takes subject to the mortgage. So perhaps that means the mortgage is treated as an encumbrance on the future interest. So when Desmond takes the property, he's subject to the mortgage, which would mean he's responsible for it.

Alternatively, when the life estate ends, the property passes to the remaindermen, and any mortgages on the life estate end as well. So if the will says the property is subject to the mortgage, perhaps it means that Desmond must pay off the mortgage when he takes the property.

Wait, but if the mortgage is only on the life estate, and the life estate is separate from Desmond's future interest, then Desmond's interest isn't liable unless he assumes it. The will's language might not be enough to make Desmond liable.

But the key here is that the will devises the property "subject to Cutler's mortgage." This language could indicate that the mortgage is an encumbrance on the property that the remaindermen must deal with. So when Desmond takes over, he takes the property with the mortgage attached, making him responsible for it.

So in that case, Desmond would be liable for the mortgage because the will specifically says the property is subject to it. That would be option B.

Alternatively, some might argue that the mortgage was only on the life estate, so Desmond isn't liable unless he assumed it. But the will's language seems to impose the mortgage as a burden on the property, making Desmond liable.

So I'm leaning towards option B: liable because the property was devised subject to the mortgage.

The question revolves around whether Desmond is liable for the mortgage on Desertacre after Osgood's death. Osgood conveyed the property to Cutler for his life, creating a life estate for Cutler and retaining a reversion for himself. In his will, Osgood devised the reversion to Desmond, with a remainder to Deirdre, and specified that the property was to be taken "subject to Cutler's mortgage."

Key points to consider:

1. **Life Estate and Mortgage**: Cutler, as the life tenant, had the right to use the property during his lifetime. He executed a mortgage on the property, but this mortgage typically only binds the life estate, not the future interests held by the remaindermen (Desmond and Deirdre). However, the will's language stating that the property is "subject to Cutler's mortgage" is crucial.

2. **Effect of the Will's Language**: The phrase "subject to Cutler's mortgage" indicates that the mortgage is treated as an encumbrance on the property. This language suggests that Desmond, as the remainderman, takes the property burdened by the mortgage, making him responsible for it.

3. **General Rule vs. Specific Language**: While generally, remaindermen are not liable for a life tenant's mortgage unless they explicitly assume it, the will's specific language overrides this general rule. By devising the property "subject to Cutler's mortgage," Osgood imposed the mortgage as a burden on the future interest, making Desmond liable.

4. **Analysis of Options**:
   - **Option A**: Incorrect. Desmond's liability is not based solely on being the devisee but on the specific language of the will.
   - **Option B**: Correct. The will's language makes Desmond liable for the mortgage by devising the property "subject to Cutler's mortgage."
   - **Option C**: Incorrect. The will's language implies an assumption of the mortgage, despite no explicit assumption.
   - **Option D**: Incorrect. Desmond's liability arises from the will's language, not merely from whether he personally granted the mortgage.

In conclusion, the will's specific language makes Desmond liable for the mortgage.
