Okay, so I have this question about monetarists and their beliefs regarding V and Q. I remember that monetarism is an economic theory that emphasizes the role of money supply in determining economic activity. It was developed by economists like Milton Friedman. 

The question is asking what monetarists believe about V and Q. The options are from A to J. I think V stands for the velocity of money, which is how quickly money circulates in the economy. Q, I'm less sure about, but I think it refers to the quantity of transactions or output. Wait, actually, in the equation of exchange, which monetarists often use, we have something like M * V = P * Q, where M is the money supply, V is the velocity, P is the price level, and Q is the real output or transactions.

Monetarists typically argue that V is stable over the long run. They believe that changes in the money supply (M) will primarily affect the price level (P) rather than real output (Q), assuming V remains constant. This is because they think that in the long run, people adjust their expectations and behavior, so the velocity doesn't change much. So if V is stable, that would mean it's not fluctuating up or down; it's consistent.

Looking at the options, H is "stable," which fits because monetarists see V as relatively stable. Other options: A says always increasing, which doesn't fit because monetarists don't believe velocity is always going up. D is always decreasing, which also doesn't make sense. E is variable, but monetarists think it's stable, so E isn't right. F, unpredictable, no. G, inversely proportional, that's more about a mathematical relationship, but the question is about their belief. I and J talk about being proportional or constant, but I think H is the best fit because "stable" captures the idea that V doesn't change much over time.

So the answer should be H: stable.

Monetarists believe that the velocity of money (V) is stable over the long run, as they think changes in the money supply primarily affect the price level rather than real output. This aligns with option H.

Answer: H
