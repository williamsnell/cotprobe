Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the uncertainty in energy when an atom is in an excited state for a certain amount of time. Hmm, I think I need to use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for this. Let me try to remember what that says.

The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle relates the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) to the time (Δt) for which the energy is not precisely known. I remember the formula is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. Wait, sometimes I see it written as ΔEΔt ≈ ħ, but I'm not sure. Oh right, I think the exact form might depend on the convention, but for the purposes of this problem, maybe it's just ħ multiplied by a factor, but perhaps I can proceed without getting too deep into that.

So the formula is ΔE ≈ ħ / (2Δt), or maybe ΔE ≈ ħ / Δt. I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact factor. But perhaps in this context, the question expects me to use ΔE ≈ ħ / (2πΔt) or something similar. Wait, I think another version is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/(2π). Because ħ is h/(2π), right? So maybe the correct formula is ΔE ≈ ħ/(2πΔt).

Wait, let me think again. The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle in terms of energy and time is ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ/2. So the minimum uncertainty is when ΔE = ħ/(2Δt). So I'll go with that.

Given that, the problem states that the atom remains in an excited state for 10^-8 seconds. So Δt is 1e-8 seconds. I need to calculate ΔE.

First, I need to know the value of ħ. I recall that Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s. So ħ is h/(2π), which is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. But since the answer options are given in ergs, I should probably convert units appropriately.

Wait, what's the relation between joules and ergs? I remember that 1 J is equal to 10^7 ergs. So to convert from J·s to erg·s, I multiply by 1e7.

So, let me calculate ħ first. Let's compute ħ in erg·s.

h = 6.62607015e-34 J·s (exact value, since it's defined now)
ħ = h / (2π) ≈ 6.62607015e-34 / (6.283185307) ≈ 1.0545718e-34 J·s

So ħ in J·s is about 1.0545718e-34. Now, converting to erg·s: 1.0545718e-34 J·s * 1e7 erg/J = 1.0545718e-27 erg·s.

Wait, no. Wait, 1 J = 1e7 erg, so 1 J·s = 1e7 erg·s. So, to convert ħ from J·s to erg·s, multiply by 1e7.

So ħ = 1.0545718e-34 J·s * 1e7 erg/J·s = 1.0545718e-27 erg·s.

Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 1 J = 1e7 erg, so 1 J·s = 1e7 erg·s. So, 1 J·s is 1e7 erg·s. So, 1.0545718e-34 J·s is equal to 1.0545718e-34 * 1e7 erg·s = 1.0545718e-27 erg·s. Yeah, that's correct.

So ħ ≈ 1.0545718e-27 erg·s.

Now, the formula is ΔE ≈ ħ/(2Δt). Wait, wait, earlier I thought it's ΔE ≈ ħ/(2Δt) because the uncertainty principle is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2. So, solving for ΔE gives ΔE ≈ ħ/(2Δt).

So, Δt is 1e-8 seconds. Let's plug in the numbers.

ΔE = (1.0545718e-27 erg·s) / (2 * 1e-8 s).

Let me compute the denominator first: 2 * 1e-8 = 2e-8.

So ΔE = 1.0545718e-27 / 2e-8 = (1.0545718 / 2) * 1e-19 = 0.5272859e-19 = 5.272859e-20 ergs.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is 7.5e-20, G is 6.6e-20, J is 9.9e-20. Hmm, none of these is exactly 5.27e-20. Did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Wait, perhaps I used the wrong formula. Maybe the correct formula is ΔE ≈ ħ/(Δt), without the 2. Let me check that.

If I use ΔE = ħ/(Δt), then ΔE = 1.0545718e-27 erg·s / 1e-8 s = 1.0545718e-19 ergs. That's about 1.05e-19 ergs.

Looking at the options, option E is 6.6e-19, F is 5e-19, I is 4.4e-19, and H is 6.6e-18. So 1.05e-19 is close to option F (5e-19) but not exactly. Wait, wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in ħ.

Wait, maybe I should double-check the value of ħ in erg·s.

Wait, Planck's constant h is 6.62607015e-34 J·s. So ħ = h/(2π) ≈ 6.62607015e-34 / 6.283185307 ≈ 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

Converting to erg·s: 1 J = 1e7 erg, so 1 J·s = 1e7 erg·s. So ħ is 1.0545718e-34 J·s * 1e7 erg/(J·s) )= 1.0545718e-27 erg·s. That's correct.

So, if I use ΔE = ħ/(2Δt) = 1.0545718e-27 erg·s / (2 * 1e-8 s) = 1.0545718e-27 / 2e-8 = (1.0545718 / 2) * 1e-19 = 0.5272859e-19 = 5.27e-20 ergs.

Looking at the options, the closest is option A:7.5e-20, G:6.6e-20, J:9.9e-20. Hmm, none exactly. But wait, perhaps I should consider the exact value of 2π. Let me try another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula used is ΔE ≈ ħ/(2πΔt). Let me see. If I use that, then ΔE = 1.0545718e-27 erg·s / (2π * 1e-8 s). Let's compute that.

Compute denominator: 2π *1e-8 ≈ 6.2831853e-8.

So ΔE = 1.0545718e-27 / 6.2831853e-8 ≈ (1.0545718 /6.2831853) ) * 1e-19 ≈ 0.1677e-19 = 1.677e-20 ergs.

Still, none of the options match. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is ΔE ≈ h/(2Δt). Let's try that. Since h is Planck's constant, which is 6.626e-34 J·s.

So ΔE = 6.626e-34 J·s / (2 *1e-8 s) )= 6.626e-34 / 2e-8 = 3.313e-26 J.

Convert J to ergs: 3.313e-26 J *1e7 erg/J = 3.313e-19 ergs.

Looking at the options, option E is 6.6e-19, which is about twice this value. Hmm.

Wait, but earlier when I used ħ/(2Δt), I got 5.27e-20, which is about 5.27e-20 ergs, but none of the options match exactly.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation steps. Let me go through it again.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it using the formula ΔE ≈ ħ/(Δt). So without the 2.

So ħ is 1.0545718e-27 erg·s.

ΔE = 1.0545718e-27 / 1e-8 = 1.0545718e-19 ergs.

Looking at the options, option E is 6.6e-19, which is much larger than 1.05e-19. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the units somewhere. Let me double-check.

Wait, another approach: maybe the time is given in seconds, and I should use the value of ħ in J·s and then convert the result to ergs.

So, let's compute using ΔE = ħ/(2Δt).

ħ = 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

Δt = 1e-8 s.

So ΔE = 1.0545718e-34 J·s / (2 * 1e-8 s) )= 1.0545718e-34 / 2e-8 = 5.272859e-27 J.

Convert to ergs: 1 J = 1e7 ergs, so 5.272859e-27 J *1e7 erg/J = 5.272859e-20 ergs.

Ah, this matches the earlier calculation. So ΔE ≈5.27e-20 ergs.

Looking at the options, option A is 7.5e-20, G is 6.6e-20, J is9.9e-20. None exactly match 5.27e-20. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the Heisenberg formula uses Δt as the time during which the energy is uncertain. Maybe the problem is using ΔE ≈ ħ/(Δt), without the 2. Let me try that.

So ΔE = 1.0545718e-34 J·s / 1e-8 s = 1.0545718e-26 J.

Convert to ergs: 1.0545718e-26 J *1e7 erg/J = 1.0545718e-19 ergs.

Again, that's about 1.05e-19 ergs, which is not an option. So perhaps the correct way is to use ΔE ≈ ħ/(2Δt), which gave me 5.27e-20, but that's not an option either.

Wait, looking at the options again, option G is 6.6e-20, which is close to 5.27e-20, but not exactly. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the time given is the average lifetime, and the uncertainty is about twice that, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the value of ħ. Let me check that again. Oh wait, ħ is approximately 1.05e-34 J·s, which is 1.05e-27 erg·s. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the question expects me to use a different value, like ħ = 6.6e-27 erg·s. Wait, let me compute that. If ħ is taken as approximately 6.6e-27 erg·s, then:

ΔE = 6.6e-27 erg·s / (2 * 1e-8 s) )= 6.6e-27 / 2e-8 = 3.3e-19 ergs.

Wait, that's 3.3e-19, which isn't an option either. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use h instead of ħ. Let me try that.

h = 6.626e-34 J·s.

If I use ΔE ≈ h/(2Δt), then:

ΔE = 6.626e-34 J·s / (2 *1e-8 s) )= 6.626e-34 / 2e-8 = 3.313e-26 J.

Convert to ergs: 3.313e-26 J *1e7 erg/J = 3.313e-19 ergs.

That's 3.3e-19 ergs, which again isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me check the options again. The options are:

A: 7.5e-20

B:8.0e-18

C:1.0e-17

D:6.6e-21

E:6.6e-19

F:5.0e-19

G:6.6e-20

H:6.6e-18

I:4.4e-19

J:9.9e-20

Hmm, the closest to 5.27e-20 is option G:6.6e-20, but that's about 25% higher. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of ħ.

Wait, wait, perhaps I should use the value of ħ as approximately 1.055e-34 J·s, which is correct, and when converted to erg·s, it's 1.055e-27 erg·s. So, using ΔE ≈ ħ/(2Δt), ΔE = (1.055e-27) / (2e-8) )= 1.055e-19 / 2 = 5.275e-20 ergs.

So, approximately 5.3e-20 ergs. Looking at the options, option A is 7.5e-20, which is about 40% higher. Option G is 6.6e-20, which is about 25% higher. Hmm, none match exactly.

Wait, perhaps the question uses a different approximation, like taking ħ as approximately 1e-34 J·s. Let me try that.

If ħ ≈ 1e-34 J·s, then converting to erg·s: 1e-34 J·s * 1e7 erg/J = 1e-27 erg·s.

So, ΔE = (1e-27 erg·s) / (2 *1e-8 s) )= 1e-19 / 2 = 5e-20 ergs.

Ah, that's exactly option F:5.0e-19? Wait, no, option F is 5.0e-19 ergs, but wait, 5e-20 is 0.5e-19, which isn't F. Wait, I think I'm getting confused with exponents.

Wait, no: 1e-27 erg·s divided by 2e-8 s is (1e-27)/(2e-8) )= (1/2) * 1e-19 = 5e-20 ergs. So that's 5e-20 ergs, which would be 5.0e-20. Looking at the options, option F is 5.0e-19, which is ten times larger. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should check the calculation again.

Wait, when I use ħ = 1.05e-34 J·s, then in erg·s it's 1.05e-27 erg·s. So ΔE = 1.05e-27 / (2e-8) = 1.05e-19 / 2 ≈ 5.25e-20 ergs.

Wait, that's 5.25e-20 ergs. None of the options match exactly, but perhaps the intended answer is option G:6.6e-20, which is close but not exact.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the time given is for the atom to return to the ground state, so maybe the uncertainty time is longer. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects me to use a different value for ħ, such as 6.6e-34 J·s, which would be if I confused ħ with h. Let's try that.

If I mistakenly use h = 6.626e-34 J·s, and use ΔE = h/(2Δt), then:

ΔE = 6.626e-34 J·s / (2 *1e-8 s) )= 6.626e-34 / 2e-8 = 3.313e-26 J.

Convert to ergs: 3.313e-26 J *1e7 erg/J = 3.313e-19 ergs.

That's about 3.3e-19 ergs, which isn't an option. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to use a different formula, like ΔE ≈ ħ/(Δt), without the 2. So, ΔE = 1.05e-27 erg·s / 1e-8 s = 1.05e-19 ergs. That's 1.05e-19, which is option I:4.4e-19? No, I is 4.4e-19, which is higher. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should consider that the question uses a different value for ħ, perhaps taking ħ as 6.6e-27 erg·s. Let me see.

If ħ ≈ 6.6e-27 erg·s, then ΔE = 6.6e-27 / (2 *1e-8) )= 6.6e-27 / 2e-8 = 3.3e-19 ergs. Still not matching any option.

Alternatively, perhaps the question uses a different approach, like using the frequency and the relation E = hν, but I'm not sure how that would apply here.

Wait, perhaps the options have a typo, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing a factor related to the time. Wait, the time given is 1e-8 seconds, which is 10 nanoseconds. That's a reasonable timescale for atomic transitions.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the energy uncertainty is given by the time energy uncertainty relation, ΔE Δt ≈ ħ. So, ΔE ≈ ħ / Δt.

So, using that, ΔE = 1.05e-27 erg·s / 1e-8 s = 1.05e-19 ergs.

Again, that's about 1.05e-19, which is not an option.

Wait, perhaps the question expects me to use a different value for ħ, perhaps 1e-34 J·s instead of 1.05e-34. Let me try that.

If ħ ≈1e-34 J·s, then in erg·s, it's 1e-27 erg·s.

So, ΔE = 1e-27 / (2e-8) )= 5e-20 ergs, which is 5.0e-20. Looking at the options, option F is 5.0e-19, which is an order of magnitude higher. So perhaps the correct option is F, but that would imply a mistake in the exponent.

Wait, no, 5e-20 is not an option. The closest is option F:5.0e-19, but that's 5e-19, which is larger by a factor of 10. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the exponent during the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should recalculate the conversion from J·s to erg·s. Let's make sure.

1 J = 1 kg·m²/s².

1 erg = 1 g·cm²/s² = 1e-3 kg·(1e-2 m)^2/s² = 1e-7 kg·m²/s².

So, 1 J = 1e7 erg. Therefore, 1 J·s = 1e7 erg·s.

So, ħ is 1.0545718e-34 J·s = 1.0545718e-34 * 1e7 erg·s = 1.0545718e-27 erg·s. That's correct.

So, using ΔE = ħ/(2Δt) = (1.0545718e-27 erg·s) / (2 *1e-8 s) )= 1.0545718e-27 / 2e-8 = (1.0545718 / 2) * 1e-19 = 0.5272859e-19 = 5.272859e-20 ergs.

So, approximately 5.27e-20 ergs. Looking at the options, the closest is option A:7.5e-20, which is a bit higher, and option G:6.6e-20, which is also higher. Alternatively, perhaps the intended answer is option G, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express 5.27e-20 in terms of the options. Let me see:

Option A:7.5e-20 → 7.5 /5.27 ≈ 1.42 times larger.

Option G:6.6e-20 → 6.6 /5.27 ≈ 1.25 times larger.

Hmm, perhaps the intended answer is option A, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects to use a different value for ħ, perhaps 6.6e-34 J·s, which would be if ħ is taken as approximately h.

Wait, if I mistakenly use h instead of ħ, then h = 6.626e-34 J·s.

Then, ΔE = h/(2Δt) = 6.626e-34 J·s / (2 *1e-8 s) )= 3.313e-26 J.

Convert to ergs: 3.313e-26 J *1e7 erg/J = 3.313e-19 ergs.

That's 3.3e-19 ergs, which is not an option. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the time is 1e-8 seconds, which is 10^-8 s, and maybe the calculation is done in a different way.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the natural units where ħ = 1, but that's unlikely in this context.

Alternatively, perhaps the question expects me to use a different factor, such as ħ/(4πΔt), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the time given is the average lifetime, and the uncertainty is half of that, but I don't think that's the case.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express the calculation using exponents more carefully.

ΔE = ħ/(2Δt) = (1.0545718e-27 erg·s) / (2 *1e-8 s) )= (1.0545718 / 2) *1e-27+8 ergs.

Wait, no, because 1e-8 in the denominator would add -8 to the exponent. Wait, no, 1e-8 in the denominator is 1e-8, so 1e-27 divided by 1e-8 is 1e-19.

So, 1.0545718e-27 / 2e-8 = (1.0545718 / 2) * 1e-19 = 0.5272859e-19 = 5.27e-20 ergs.

Yes, that's correct. So, 5.27e-20 ergs.

Looking at the options again, option A is 7.5e-20, G is6.6e-20. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the intended answer is option A, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects me to use a different value for ħ, perhaps 6.6e-27 erg·s, which would make the calculation as follows:

ΔE = 6.6e-27 erg·s / (2 *1e-8 s) )= 6.6e-27 / 2e-8 = 3.3e-19 ergs. But that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the question uses a different approach, like considering the thermal energy or something else, but I don't think so.

Wait, perhaps I should check the possible options again. The options are:

A:7.5 x 10^-20 ergs

B:8.0 x 10^-18

C:1.0 x 10^-17

D:6.6 x 10^-21

E:6.6 x 10^-19

F:5.0 x 10^-19

G:6.6 x 10^-20

H:6.6 x 10^-18

I:4.4 x 10^-19

J:9.9 x 10^-20

Hmm, perhaps the intended answer is option A:7.5e-20. But why? Because maybe I made a miscalculation in the value of ħ. Let me check the exact value of ħ.

Exact value of ħ is 1.054571817e-34 J·s. So, converting to erg·s, it's 1.054571817e-27 erg·s.

So, with Δt =1e-8 s, ΔE = 1.054571817e-27 / (2 *1e-8) )= 1.054571817e-27 /2e-8 = 5.272859085e-20 ergs.

So, about 5.27e-20 ergs. The closest option is option A:7.5e-20, but that's higher. Alternatively, perhaps the intended answer is option G:6.6e-20.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 1.05e-27 divided by 2e-8. Let me compute 1.05e-27 / 2e-8 = (1.05 / 2) * 1e-19 = 0.525e-19 =5.25e-20. So, 5.25e-20 ergs.

Looking at the options, option F is 5.0e-19, which is an order of magnitude higher. So, perhaps the intended answer is option A, but I'm not sure why.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the time given is 1e-8 seconds, and the uncertainty is in the same order of magnitude. But I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps I should check the options again. The options are A to J, and I think the correct answer should be around 5.27e-20, which isn't an option. But perhaps the options are using a different value for ħ, such as 6.6e-27 erg·s. Let me try that.

If ħ is 6.6e-27 erg·s, then ΔE = 6.6e-27 / (2 *1e-8) )= 6.6e-27 / 2e-8 = 3.3e-19 ergs. Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the question expects me to use the relation ΔE ≈ ħ/(Δt), without the 2. So, ΔE = 1.05e-27 /1e-8 =1.05e-19 ergs. That's 1.05e-19, which isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the time is 1e-8 seconds, and the energy uncertainty is in the order of 1e-20 ergs. So, perhaps the intended answer is option A:7.5e-20, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me try another approach.

Wait, perhaps the time is given as 1e-8 seconds, and the uncertainty principle is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ. So, ΔE ≈ ħ / Δt.

So, ħ in erg·s is 1.05e-27 erg·s.

ΔE = 1.05e-27 / 1e-8 =1.05e-19 ergs.

Again, 1.05e-19 ergs, which isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps the question is using a different value for ħ, such as 6.6e-34 J·s, which would be h, not ħ. Let me try that.

h =6.626e-34 J·s.

So, ΔE = h/(2Δt) =6.626e-34 / (2 *1e-8) )=3.313e-26 J.

Convert to ergs:3.313e-26 *1e7 =3.313e-19 ergs.

Still not matching any option.

Wait, perhaps the question expects me to use a different approach, considering that the energy levels are quantized and the uncertainty is related to the photon energy. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using a different version of the uncertainty principle, like ΔE Δt ≥ 1/2πħ, which would change the calculation.

Wait, if the uncertainty principle is ΔE Δt ≥ ħ/(2π), then ΔE ≥ ħ/(2πΔt).

So, ħ is 1.05e-34 J·s.

So, ΔE = 1.05e-34 / (2π *1e-8) )= 1.05e-34 / (6.283e-8) )= approximately 1.67e-27 J.

Convert to ergs:1.67e-27 J *1e7 erg/J =1.67e-20 ergs.

That's about 1.67e-20 ergs, which is close to option G:6.6e-20, but not exact.

Wait, perhaps the intended answer is option G:6.6e-20. Let me see.

If I use ΔE = ħ/(2πΔt), then:

ΔE = (1.05e-34 J·s) / (2π *1e-8 s) )= 1.05e-34 / (6.283e-8) )= 1.67e-27 J =1.67e-20 ergs.

Hmm, that's 1.67e-20, which is close to option G:6.6e-20. No, it's an order of magnitude smaller. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the time given is the lifetime of the excited state, and the uncertainty is about half that time. So, perhaps Δt is 5e-9 seconds. But the problem states 1e-8 seconds.

Alternatively, perhaps the question expects me to use a different value for ħ, perhaps 6.6e-34 J·s, which would be h instead of ħ.

So, using h =6.626e-34 J·s, and using ΔE ≈ h/(2Δt), then:

ΔE =6.626e-34 / (2 *1e-8) )=3.313e-26 J.

Convert to ergs:3.313e-26 *1e7 =3.313e-19 ergs.

Still not matching any option.

Wait, perhaps the intended answer is option E:6.6e-19 ergs, which is twice the value I calculated earlier when using h instead of ħ. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the question expects me to use a different formula, such as ΔE ≈ ħ/(Δt), without the 2, which would give 1.05e-19 ergs. But that's not an option.

I'm a bit stuck here because none of the options match exactly with the calculated value. Perhaps the intended answer is option A:7.5e-20 ergs, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps I should compute using ħ =1e-34 J·s, which is a rough approximation.

So, ħ =1e-34 J·s.

ΔE =1e-34 / (2 *1e-8) )=5e-27 J.

Convert to ergs:5e-27 *1e7 =5e-20 ergs.

Ah, that's exactly option F:5.0e-20 ergs. Wait, but looking back, option F is 5.0e-19 ergs, which is an order of magnitude higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the exponents. Let me check:

If ħ is 1e-34 J·s, then in erg·s, it's 1e-27 erg·s.

So, ΔE =1e-27 / (2e-8) )= (1/2) * 1e-19 =5e-20 ergs.

Yes, that's correct. So, 5e-20 ergs.

But looking at the options, I don't see 5e-20. The closest is option F:5.0e-19, which is larger by a factor of 10.

Hmm, perhaps the intended answer is option F, but I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the conversion from J·s to erg·s.

1 J =1e7 erg, so 1 J·s =1e7 erg·s.

So, ħ =1.05e-34 J·s =1.05e-34 *1e7 erg·s =1.05e-27 erg·s.

So, correct.

So, ΔE =1.05e-27 / (2e-8) )=5.25e-20 ergs.

Thus, the correct answer should be approximately 5.25e-20 ergs, which isn't an option. So perhaps the intended answer is option A:7.5e-20, but I'm not certain why.

Alternatively, perhaps the question intended to use a time of 1e-9 seconds, which would give:

ΔE =1.05e-27 / (2e-9) )=5.25e-19 ergs.

That's 5.25e-19 ergs, which is close to option F:5.0e-19. But the problem states 1e-8 seconds, not 1e-9.

I think I've spent enough time on this. Based on the calculations, the closest option to 5.27e-20 ergs isn't present, but perhaps the intended answer is option G:6.6e-20. Alternatively, option A:7.5e-20 is another possibility. But given the options, I think the intended answer is option A:7.5e-20, but I'm not fully confident.

The problem involves calculating the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) of an excited state using the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which relates ΔE and Δt as ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2. Here, Δt is given as 10⁻⁸ seconds, and ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. 

### Step 1: Understanding the Formula
The formula used is:
\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{\hbar}{2\Delta t}
\]
where ħ ≈ \(1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}\). Converting ħ to erg·s (\(1 \, \text{J} = 10^7 \, \text{erg}\)):
\[
\hbar \approx 1.0545718 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{erg·s}.
\]

### Step 2: Substituting Values
Substituting Δt = \(10^{-8} \, \text{s}\):
\[
\Delta E = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-27}}{2 \times 10^{-8}} = \frac{1.0545718}{2} \times 10^{-19} \approx 5.27 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{ergs}.
\]

### Step 3: Comparing with Options
The calculated value (\(5.27 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{ergs}\)) does not exactly match any option. However, the closest options are:
- **A: \(7.5 \times 10^{-20}\)** (25% higher)
- **G: \(6.6 \times 10^{-20}\)** (25% higher)

### Step 4: Considering Approximations
The discrepancy might arise from rounding or approximations in the problem's setup or the options provided. Based on the calculations, the intended answer is likely **A: \(7.5 \times 10^{-20}\)**, as it is the closest to the computed value.
