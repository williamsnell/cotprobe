Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem where I need to find V_ab(t) given the voltage v(t) and a relationship involving the Laplace transforms. Hmm, let me start by understanding what's given.

The voltage v(t) is given as 10e^(-4t) u(t). So, that's a decaying exponential multiplied by the unit step function. I remember that the Laplace transform of e^(-at)u(t) is 1/(s+a). So, the Laplace transform of v(t), which I think is V(s), should be 10/(s + 4).

Now, the problem says that V_ab(s) is related to V(s) by the equation V_ab(s) = [3V(s) + 3s + 27] / (s² + 6s + 8). My goal is to find V_ab(t), which is the inverse Laplace transform of V_ab(s).

First, let me substitute V(s) into that equation. So, substituting V(s) = 10/(s + 4) into the expression for V_ab(s):

V_ab(s) = [3*(10/(s+4)) + 3s + 27] / (s² + 6s + 8)

Let me compute the numerator step by step. 3*(10/(s+4)) is 30/(s+4). Then I have 3s and 27. So, the numerator becomes 30/(s+4) + 3s + 27.

Wait, but I think it's better to combine all terms over a common denominator or simplify the expression first. Alternatively, perhaps factor the denominator to make partial fraction decomposition easier.

The denominator is s² +6s +8. Let me factor that: looking for two numbers that multiply to 8 and add to 6. That would be 2 and 4. So, (s + 2)(s +4).

So, the denominator factors into (s + 2)(s +4). So, V_ab(s) = [30/(s+4) + 3s +27] / [(s +2)(s +4)].

Wait, but I think I need to combine all the terms in the numerator into a single fraction or perhaps expand it. Let me see: the numerator has 30/(s+4) plus 3s +27. Let me combine 3s +27 into a single term. Hmm, maybe I should express the entire numerator as a single expression over (s+4).

Wait, perhaps it's better to write V_ab(s) as [3V(s) + 3s +27]/(s² +6s +8) and substitute V(s) first.

Wait, let me compute the numerator:

3V(s) = 3*(10/(s+4)) = 30/(s+4)

So, the numerator is 30/(s+4) + 3s +27.

Wait, perhaps I should combine all terms over (s+4)(s+2), which is the denominator of V_ab(s). Alternatively, perhaps expand the numerator:

Let me write the numerator as [30/(s+4)] + 3s +27.

But adding fractions and polynomials can be tricky. Maybe I should express 3s +27 as a fraction over 1, and then combine everything over the common denominator (s+4)(s+2).

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Alternatively, perhaps express the entire numerator as a single fraction.

Wait, let me think differently. Let me define the numerator as N(s) = 3V(s) +3s +27. So N(s) = 30/(s+4) + 3s +27.

I can write N(s) as 3s +27 + 30/(s+4). Now, perhaps factor out 3 from 3s +27: that's 3(s +9), but I'm not sure if that helps.

Wait, maybe I can express the entire N(s) over (s+4)(s+2) as the denominator of V_ab(s). So, V_ab(s) = N(s) / [(s+2)(s+4)].

So, let's express N(s) as [3s +27 + 30/(s+4)].

Wait, perhaps it's better to combine all terms into a single fraction. Let me try that.

The denominator for N(s) would be (s+4), so:

N(s) = [ (3s +27)(s+4) +30 ] / (s+4)

So, expanding (3s +27)(s +4):

3s*s = 3s²

3s*4 = 12s

27*s = 27s

27*4 = 108

So, adding these together: 3s² + (12s +27s) +108 = 3s² +39s +108.

Then, adding 30 gives 3s² +39s +108 +30 = 3s² +39s +138.

So, N(s) = (3s² +39s +138) / (s +4).

Now, V_ab(s) is N(s) divided by (s+2)(s+4), so:

V_ab(s) = [ (3s² +39s +138)/(s+4) ] / [ (s+2)(s+4) )

Which simplifies to (3s² +39s +138) / [ (s+4)(s+2)(s+4) ) ].

Wait, that seems a bit complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can perform polynomial long division on the numerator and denominator.

Wait, but maybe I should factor the numerator and denominator to see if anything cancels.

Wait, looking back, perhaps I made a mistake in expanding (3s +27)(s +4). Let me recompute that.

(3s +27)(s +4) = 3s*s +3s*4 +27*s +27*4 = 3s² +12s +27s +108 = 3s² +39s +108. Then adding 30 gives 3s² +39s +138. So that's correct.

So, V_ab(s) = (3s² +39s +138) / [ (s+4)^2 (s+2) ) ]

Hmm, that looks a bit messy, but perhaps I can perform partial fraction decomposition.

Let me write V_ab(s) as A/(s+2) + B/(s+4) + C/(s+4)^2.

Because the denominator is (s+2)(s+4)^2, so the partial fractions would be A/(s+2) + B/(s+4) + C/(s+4)^2.

So, let's set up the equation:

(3s² +39s +138) / [ (s+2)(s+4)^2 ] = A/(s+2) + B/(s+4) + C/(s+4)^2.

Multiply both sides by (s+2)(s+4)^2:

3s² +39s +138 = A(s+4)^2 + B(s+2)(s+4) + C(s+2).

Now, expand each term on the right:

A(s+4)^2 = A(s² +8s +16)

B(s+2)(s+4) = B(s² +6s +8)

C(s+2) = C s + 2C

So, combining all terms:

A s² +8A s +16A + B s² +6B s +8B + C s +2C.

Now, group like terms:

s² terms: (A + B)s²

s terms: (8A +6B + C)s

constant terms: 16A +8B +2C.

Set these equal to the left side, which is 3s² +39s +138. So, we have:

A + B = 3 --> equation 1

8A +6B + C = 39 --> equation 2

16A +8B +2C = 138 --> equation 3

Now, we have three equations with three unknowns.

Let me solve equation 1 for A: A = 3 - B.

Substitute A into equations 2 and 3.

Equation 2: 8(3 - B) +6B + C =39

=24 -8B +6B + C =39

=24 -2B + C =39

Rearranged: -2B + C = 15 --> equation 2a.

Equation 3: 16(3-B) +8B +2C =138

=48 -16B +8B +2C =138

=48 -8B +2C =138

Subtract 48: -8B +2C =90 --> equation 3a.

Now, from equation 2a: C = 15 + 2B.

Substitute C into equation 3a:

-8B + 2*(15 + 2B) =90

= -8B +30 +4B =90

= (-4B) +30 =90

-4B =60 → B= -15.

Now, from equation 1: A =3 - B =3 - (-15) =18.

From equation 2a: C=15 +2*(-15) =15 -30= -15.

So, A=18, B=-15, C=-15.

So, the partial fractions are:

V_ab(s) = 18/(s+2) + (-15)/(s+4) + (-15)/(s+4)^2.

Now, taking the inverse Laplace transform of each term:

L^{-1}[18/(s+2)] = 18 e^{-2t} u(t)

L^{-1}[(-15)/(s+4)] = -15 e^{-4t} u(t)

L^{-1}[ (-15)/(s+4)^2 ] = -15 * t e^{-4t} u(t) → because L{ t e^{-at} } = 1/(s+a)^2.

So combining these, V_ab(t) = 18 e^{-2t} -15 e^{-4t} -15 t e^{-4t}.

Wait, but looking at the options, the terms are presented in a different order. Let me see the options:

Looking at option A: -15 t e^{-4t} -15 e^{-4t} +18 e^{-2t}.

Which matches what I have, except the order is rearranged. So that's option A.

But wait, let me check the options again.

Option A: V_ab(t) = -15 te^-4t -15 e^-4t + 18 e^-2t → Yes, that's exactly what I have.

But wait, looking at the options, option E is similar but with positive signs. Let me make sure I didn't make a sign error.

Wait, when I solved for the partial fractions, I got B=-15 and C=-15. So the terms are:

-15/(s+4) → -15 e^{-4t}

-15/(s+4)^2 → -15 t e^{-4t}

So, yes, the terms are negative.

So, V_ab(t) = 18 e^{-2t} -15 e^{-4t} -15 t e^{-4t}.

Which is option A: -15 te^-4t -15 e^-4t +18 e^-2t.

But wait, the options have the terms in that order, so yes, option A matches.

To determine \( V_{ab}(t) \), we start with \( v(t) = 10e^{-4t}u(t) \), whose Laplace transform is \( V(s) = \frac{10}{s+4} \). Using the given relationship \( V_{ab}(s) = \frac{3V(s) + 3s + 27}{(s^2 + 6s + 8)} \), we substitute \( V(s) \) into the expression:

\[
V_{ab}(s) = \frac{3\left(\frac{10}{s+4}\right) + 3s + 27}{(s+2)(s+4)}.
\]

Simplifying the numerator:

\[
3\left(\frac{10}{s+4}\right) + 3s + 27 = \frac{30}{s+4} + 3s + 27.
\]

Combining terms over a common denominator:

\[
\frac{30 + (3s + 27)(s+4)}{(s+4)} = \frac{3s^2 + 39s + 138}{(s+4)}.
\]

Thus, \( V_{ab}(s) \) becomes:

\[
V_{ab}(s) = \frac{3s^2 + 39s + 138}{(s+2)(s+4)^2}.
\]

Using partial fraction decomposition:

\[
V_{ab}(s) = \frac{A}{s+2} + \frac{B}{s+4} + \frac{C}{(s+4)^2}.
\]

Solving for \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \), we find \( A = 18 \), \( B = -15 \), and \( C = -15 \). Taking the inverse Laplace transform:

\[
V_{ab}(t) = 18e^{-2t} - 15e^{-4t} - 15te^{-4t}.
\]

Rearranging terms, this matches option **A**.
