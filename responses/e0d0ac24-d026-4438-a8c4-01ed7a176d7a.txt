Okay, so I've got this problem about radioactive decay measurements. Let's see what it's asking. A student made 10 one-second measurements and got the values 3,0,2,1,2,4,0,1,2,5. The question is, how long should the student count to establish the rate with an uncertainty of 1 percent?

Hmm, I remember that radioactive decay follows a Poisson process, and the uncertainty is related to the square root of the count. But wait, the student is taking multiple measurements, so maybe I should look at the total counts first.

Let me calculate the total counts from those 10 seconds. Adding them up: 3+0=3, +2=5, +1=6, +2=8, +4=12, +0=12, +1=13, +2=15, +5=20. So total counts are 20 in 10 seconds. That means the average count per second is 20/10 = 2 counts per second.

Wait, no, wait. The average is 20 counts over 10 seconds, so 2 counts per second. But I'm not sure if I should be using the average or the total counts when considering uncertainty. Oh right, for Poisson statistics, the uncertainty (standard deviation) is sqrt(N), where N is the number of events. So for each second, the uncertainty would be sqrt(2), but wait, no, because each measurement is one second, so each has N_i counts, and the uncertainty for each is sqrt(N_i). But the overall uncertainty when combining multiple measurements would be based on the total counts.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the variance of the measurements to find the standard deviation and then determine how much more data is needed to achieve 1% uncertainty.

Let me think again. The average (mean) count per second is 20/10 = 2. The variance for each measurement is calculated as the average of the squared differences from the mean. So for each of the 10 measurements, I subtract the mean (2) and square it, then average those.

Calculating each (x_i - mean)^2:
(3-2)^2 = 1
(0-2)^2 =4
(2-2)^2=0
(1-2)^2=1
(2-2)^2=0
(4-2)^2=4
(0-2)^2=4
(1-2)^2=1
(2-2)^2=0
(5-2)^2=9

Adding these up: 1+4=5, +0=5, +1=6, +0=6, +4=10, +4=14, +1=15, +0=15, +9=24. So the sum of squares is 24. Then the variance (s²) is 24 / (10-1) = 24/9 ≈ 2.6667. So the standard deviation (s) is sqrt(2.6667) ≈ 1.63299.

Wait, but since each measurement is one second, the standard deviation per measurement is about 1.633 counts per second. But when you take multiple measurements, the overall uncertainty decreases. So if the student takes t seconds, each second is a measurement, and the total counts would be the sum over t measurements. The variance would be the sum of variances, which for each second is (s²) = (1.633)^2 ≈ 2.666 per second. Wait, no, that's not right because the variance for each individual measurement is based on the count in that second. Actually, when you have multiple independent measurements, the variance of the sum is the sum of variances. So the total variance after t seconds would be t times the variance per second.

Wait, maybe I'm complicating it. Let me think differently. The average count per second is 2. The standard deviation of the average would be the standard deviation of the individual measurements divided by sqrt(n), where n is the number of measurements. But in this case, each measurement is one second, and the student is taking multiple one-second measurements to find the average.

Alternatively, perhaps the approach is to use the Poisson statistics for the total count. The total counts in t seconds would be N = 2t (since average is 2 per second). The uncertainty would be sqrt(N) = sqrt(2t). The relative uncertainty is sqrt(N)/N = 1/sqrt(N) = 1/sqrt(2t). We need this relative uncertainty to be <= 1%, so 1/sqrt(2t) <= 0.01.

Solving for t: sqrt(2t) >= 100 → 2t >= 10000 → t >= 5000 seconds.

Wait, but that would suggest the answer is 5000 seconds, which is option G. But wait, let me check that again.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the standard deviation of the initial 10 measurements, then determine how many more measurements (t) are needed to reduce the relative uncertainty to 1%.

The initial standard deviation (s) for the 10 measurements is sqrt(2.6667) ≈1.633. The relative uncertainty in the mean is s / sqrt(n), where n=10. So s/sqrt(10)=1.633/3.162≈0.516 or about 51.6% uncertainty. That's way higher than 1%, so we need more data.

The formula for the relative uncertainty (U_rel) when taking t measurements is U_rel = s / (sqrt(t)*sqrt(n)), where n is the number of samples. Wait, no, perhaps it's better to model the uncertainty in the mean. The standard error of the mean (SEM) is s/sqrt(n). So for the initial 10 measurements, SEM is 1.633/3.162 ≈0.516. To achieve a relative uncertainty of 1%, U_rel = SEM / mean = 0.516 / 2 = 25.8%, which is way higher than 1%. So we need to find t such that SEM_new = s_new / sqrt(t) where s_new is the standard deviation of the counts over t seconds.

Wait, perhaps another approach. The uncertainty in the count rate is given by the standard error of the mean. The formula for the count rate (R) is R = N / t, where N is total counts. The variance of R is (s²)/(t²), so the standard error is s/(t). Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Alternatively, the uncertainty in the total count N is sqrt(N), and since R = N/t, the uncertainty in R would be (sqrt(N)/t) / (N/t) ) * 100% = (sqrt(N)/N) *100% = 100% / sqrt(N).

So to get 1% uncertainty, 100% / sqrt(N) = 1% → sqrt(N) = 100 → N = 10000.

So the total counts N should be 10000. Since R is 2 per second, t = N/R = 10000 /2 =5000 seconds. So option G (5000 s) is the answer.

Wait, but wait, in the initial 10 seconds, total counts are 20, so R is 2 per second. So to get N=10000, t=5000 seconds. That seems right.

To determine how long the student should count to establish the rate with an uncertainty of 1%, we start by analyzing the given data. The student made 10 one-second measurements of radioactive decay, yielding the counts: 3, 0, 2, 1, 2, 4, 0, 1, 2, 5. The total counts over 10 seconds are 20, giving an average count rate of \( R = \frac{20}{10} = 2 \, \text{counts per second} \).

For radioactive decay, the uncertainty in the count rate follows Poisson statistics, where the uncertainty in the total count \( N \) is \( \sqrt{N} \). The relative uncertainty is given by:

\[
\text{Relative Uncertainty} = \frac{\sqrt{N}}{N} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}.
\]

To achieve a relative uncertainty of 1% (\( 0.01 \)), we solve for \( N \):

\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}} \leq 0.01 \implies \sqrt{N} \geq 100 \implies N \geq 10000.
\]

The total counts \( N \) are related to the count rate \( R \) and the counting time \( t \) by \( N = R \cdot t \). Substituting \( R = 2 \, \text{counts per second} \) and \( N = 10000 \), we find:

\[
t = \frac{N}{R} = \frac{10000}{2} = 5000 \, \text{seconds}.
\]

Thus, the student should count for **5000 seconds** to achieve the desired uncertainty.
