Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to compute two line integrals: one along a straight line K from (0,0) to (1,1), and another along a parabola L, which is y = x², also from (0,0) to (1,1). The integrand for both is xy dx. The options are given as A through J, each with two numbers corresponding to the integrals over K and L, respectively.

Alright, let me start by recalling what a line integral is. A line integral allows us to integrate a function along a curve. In this case, the function is f(x, y) = xy, and we're integrating with respect to dx. So, the integral ∫C xy dx is the line integral along the curve C of the function xy with respect to x.

First, I'll tackle the integral over the straight line K. Since K is a straight line from (0,0) to (1,1), I can parameterize it. A common parameterization for a straight line is to let x = t, so y would also be t because when x goes from 0 to 1, y goes from 0 to 1. So, the parameterization is x = t, y = t, where t ranges from 0 to 1.

Now, substituting into the integral, since we're integrating with respect to dx, and dx = dt (because x = t, so dx/dt = 1, so dx = dt), the integral becomes ∫ from t=0 to t=1 of (t * t) dt. Simplifying, that's ∫₀¹ t² dt.

Calculating that integral: the integral of t² is (t³)/3. Evaluated from 0 to 1 gives (1³)/3 - (0³)/3 = 1/3 ≈ 0.333. So, the integral over K is 1/3 or approximately 0.333.

Next, I'll compute the integral over the parabola L, which is y = x² from (0,0) to (1,1). Again, I'll parameterize this curve. Since y is given as x², I can let x = t, which means y = t². Here, t will also range from 0 to 1 because when x is 0, t is 0, and when x is 1, t is 1.

So, the parameterization is x = t, y = t², and dx/dt is 1, so dx = dt. The integrand xy becomes t * t² = t³. Therefore, the integral becomes ∫ from t=0 to t=1 of t³ dt.

The integral of t³ is (t⁴)/4. Evaluated from 0 to 1 gives (1⁴)/4 - 0 = 1/4 = 0.25. So, the integral over L is 0.25.

Wait, but looking at the options, I see options like [0.333, 0.25] as option I. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

For K: x = t, y = t. So, xy = t². Integral is ∫₀¹ t² dt = [t³/3]₀¹ = 1/3 ≈ 0.333. That seems right.

For L: x = t, y = t². So, xy = t * t² = t³. Integral is ∫₀¹ t³ dt = [t⁴/4]₀¹ = 1/4 = 0.25. Yep, that's correct.

So, the two values are 1/3 and 1/4, which are approximately 0.333 and 0.25. Looking at the options, option I is [0.333, 0.25]. So, the answer should be option I.

The line integral over the straight line K is 1/3 (≈0.333), and over the parabola L is 1/4 (≈0.25). So, the answer is [0.333, 0.25].
