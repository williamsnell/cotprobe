Okay, so I need to find the Laplace transform of t^n u(t). Hmm, I remember that the Laplace transform is a tool used in engineering and mathematics to convert time-domain functions into frequency-domain functions. It's especially useful for solving differential equations.

Wait, the function here is t raised to the power of n, multiplied by the unit step function u(t). So the function is t^n u(t). I think the unit step function u(t) is 0 for t<0 and 1 for t>=0. So, the Laplace transform of t^n u(t) would be the same as the Laplace transform of t^n for t >= 0, since u(t) is zero otherwise.

I remember that the Laplace transform of t^n is n! divided by s^(n+1). Let me think about that formula. Oh right, the general formula is L{t^n} = n! / s^{n+1}, but that's for t >= 0, which is exactly what we have here because of the unit step.

So looking at the options, I need to find which one matches this. Let's see the options again.

Option A: n! / s^(n+3) → No, that's s^(n+3), which is way higher than what we need.

Option B: (n+1)! / s^(n+1) → Hmm, the numerator would be (n+1)! but we have n! in the correct formula. So this isn't right.

Option C: n! / s^n → Wait, no, because the denominator should be s^(n+1), not s^n. So C is incorrect.

Option D: n! / s^{n+2} → No, that's s^(n+2), which is still off by one.

Option E: n! / s^{n+1} → Yes, this matches the formula I was thinking of.

Wait, let me double-check the formula. The Laplace transform of t^n is indeed n! / s^{n+1}. So option E must be correct.

Looking at the other options again to make sure I didn't miss anything. Option B has (n+1)! which would be for a different function, maybe t^{n+1}. Option C is s^n, which is off by a power. So no, E is the right choice.

The Laplace transform of \( t^n u(t) \) is given by the formula \( \frac{n!}{s^{n+1}} \), which corresponds to option E.

Answer: E
