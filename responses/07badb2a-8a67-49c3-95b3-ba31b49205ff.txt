Okay, so I have this question here where I need to find the deviation of each number from the mean. The given numbers are 4, 4, 6, 7, 9. The options are A through J, each with different sets of deviations. I'm a bit rusty on statistics, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

First, I remember that the deviation from the mean is calculated by subtracting the mean from each individual data point. So, I need to find the mean of these numbers first.

Let me add them up: 4 + 4 is 8, plus 6 is 14, plus 7 is 21, and then 9 brings it to 30. Since there are 5 numbers, the mean is 30 divided by 5, which is 6. So the mean is 6.

Now, I'll calculate each deviation by subtracting the mean (6) from each number.

1. The first number is 4. So 4 minus 6 is -2.
2. The second number is also 4. So another -2.
3. The third number is 6. 6 minus 6 is 0.
4. The fourth number is 7. 7 minus 6 is +1.
5. The fifth number is 9. 9 minus 6 is +3.

So the deviations should be: -2, -2, 0, 1, 3.

Looking at the options, I'll check each one:

Option A: -3, -1, 1, 2, 5 → Doesn't match.
Option B: -2, 0, 2, 3, 4 → Close, but the third deviation is 2, which would mean the number was 8. Not the case here.
Option C: -2, -1, 0, 2, 3 → The second deviation is -1, which would mean the second number is 5. Not correct.
Option D: 0, 0, 2, 3, 5 → Doesn't match.
Option E: -2, 0, 1, 1, 4 → The last deviation is 4, which would be 10, not 9.
Option F: -1, -1, 1, 2, 3 → First two deviations are -1, meaning numbers would be 5, which isn't correct.
Option G: -3, -3, 0, 1, 2 → Doesn't match.
Option H: -2, -2, 0, 1, 3 → This exactly matches what I calculated.
Option I: -1, 0, 0, 3, 4 → Doesn't match.
Option J: -1, -1, 0, 2, 4 → Doesn't match.

So the correct answer should be Option H.

The deviations from the mean (6) are calculated as -2, -2, 0, 1, 3, which corresponds to option H.

Answer: H
