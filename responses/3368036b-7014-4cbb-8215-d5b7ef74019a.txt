Okay, so I'm trying to find the ratio of the focal lengths of a glass lens when it's in water compared to when it's in air. The refractive indices given are for glass (1.5) and water (1.33). Hmm, I remember that the focal length of a lens depends on the refractive index of the surrounding medium. 

Wait, the formula for the focal length of a lens in a medium is related to the lens maker's formula. Right, the lens maker's formula is 1/f = (n_lens/n_medium - 1) * (1/R1 - 1/R2), where R1 and R2 are the radii of curvature of the lens surfaces. But since the lens is made of glass, its refractive index is n_glass, and the surrounding medium is either air or water.

So, when the lens is in air, the surrounding medium's refractive index n_medium is 1. And when it's in water, n_medium is 1.33. So the focal length in each case will be different.

I think the formula for focal length f is given by f = (n_lens / (n_medium - 1)) * something, but I'm a bit confused. Wait, maybe I should write the lens maker's formula correctly. The correct formula is 1/f = (n_rel - 1) * (1/R1 - 1/R2), where n_rel is the relative refractive index of the lens with respect to the medium.

Wait, but I think more accurately, the formula is f = (R1 * R2) / (R2 - R1) * (n_lens - n_medium), but wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again. Oh wait, the lens maker's formula in a medium is 1/f = (n_lens/n_medium - 1) * (1/R1 - 1/R2), but assuming the lens is thin, and we can neglect higher-order terms, but I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, I remember that the focal length depends on the refractive index of the material relative to the surrounding medium. So the focal length is inversely proportional to (n_lens/n_medium - 1). Because the higher the relative refractive index, the shorter the focal length, right?

Wait, so when the lens is in air, the formula becomes 1/f_air = (n_glass - 1) * (1/R1 - 1/R2). When it's in water, it becomes 1/f_water = (n_glass / n_water - 1) * (1/R1 - 1/R2). So the ratio of focal lengths would be f_water / f_air.

So let's compute the ratio f_water / f_air. From the two equations:

1/f_air = (n_g - 1) * k → where k is (1/R1 - 1/R2), a constant for the lens shape.

1/f_water = (n_g / n_water - 1) * k

So f_air = 1 / [(n_g - 1) * k ]

f_water = 1 / [ (n_g / n_water - 1) * k ]

So f_water / f_air = [1 / ( (n_g/n_water -1) k ) ] / [1/ ( (n_g -1) k ) ] 

The k terms cancel out, and the denominators invert. So this becomes (n_g -1) / (n_g/n_water -1 )

Let me compute that:

n_g is 1.5, n_water is 1.33.

So numerator: 1.5 -1 = 0.5

Denominator: (1.5/1.33) -1 = (1.5/(1.33)) -1

Calculate 1.5 /1.33: 1.5 ÷ 1.33 ≈ 1.1275

So denominator is 1.1275 - 1 = 0.1275

So the ratio f_water/f_air = 0.5 / 0.1275 ≈ let me compute that.

0.5 ÷ 0.1275. Let me see: 0.1275 × 3.91 ≈ 0.5 because 0.1275 *4 = 0.51, which is a bit more than 0.5. So 3.91 approximately, because 0.1275 * 3.91 ≈ 0.5.

Wait, wait, 0.1275 × 3.91 = ?

Let me compute 0.1275 *3.91:

0.1275 *3 = 0.3825

0.1275 *0.91 = 0.11625. So total is 0.3825 + 0.11625 = 0.49875, which is about 0.5.

So the ratio is approximately 3.91. So the focal length in water is about 3.91 times longer than in air.

Wait, but the question asks for the ratio of focal lengths when the lens is in water compared to air. So that's f_water / f_air = approximately 3.91. Looking at the options, option I is 3.91. So the answer should be I:3.91.
