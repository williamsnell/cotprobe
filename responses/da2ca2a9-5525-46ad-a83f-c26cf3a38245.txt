Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about neutron decay. Hmm, I remember that a neutron can decay into a proton and an electron, right? Oh, wait, actually, I think it also emits an antineutrino because of conservation laws, but maybe that's not important for this problem. The question is about the fraction of the released energy that goes into the proton's kinetic energy.

Alright, the neutron is at rest, so when it decays, the proton and electron (and antineutrino) must move in such a way that their momentum adds up to zero since the initial momentum is zero. Momentum conservation should be key here.

I think I should start by considering the masses. The mass of the proton is given as 1836 times that of the electron. Let me denote the electron mass as m, so the proton is 1836m. The neutron's mass is a bit more complicated, but wait—actually, in decay processes, the mass of the neutron is known to be slightly more than a proton because it's unstable. Wait, but for exact calculations, maybe I should look up the masses. Oh, but perhaps the problem assumes that the neutron's mass is the sum of the proton and electron masses plus some binding energy, but I'm not sure. Wait, no, that's not correct because the neutron is more massive than the proton. Let me think: the masses are such that the neutron mass is approximately equal to the proton mass plus the electron mass plus the mass of the antineutrino. But since the neutrino is very light, maybe we can approximate it as massless for this problem. Or perhaps the problem abstracts away the neutrino's mass. Hmm, maybe I should proceed with just the proton and electron.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me get the actual masses straight. The rest mass of a neutron is about 939 MeV/c². The proton is about 938 MeV/c², and the electron is about 0.511 MeV/c². So the difference in mass between the neutron and the proton is about 1 MeV, which is where the decay energy comes from. But that's maybe more detailed than I need for this problem, which probably expects me to use the given ratios.

So the problem states that the proton's mass is 1836 times the electron's mass. So m_p = 1836 m_e. Got it.

Now, when the neutron at rest decays, the total energy released is the mass difference between the neutron and the sum of the proton and electron masses. But wait, the neutron's mass is m_n, and the decay products are the proton (m_p) and electron (m_e), plus the antineutrino (which I'll neglect here for simplicity, assuming its mass is negligible). So the Q value of the decay (the energy released) is Q = (m_n - m_p - m_e)c². But since the problem says energy is released, I can proceed with this.

But maybe I don't need to calculate the actual energy values. Instead, I can work with the velocities and kinetic energies of the proton and electron.

Since the neutron is at rest, the total momentum after decay must be zero. So the momenta of the proton and electron must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. Let's denote the velocity of the proton as v_p and the electron as v_e. So their momenta must satisfy p_p = -p_e, which implies m_p v_p = m_e v_e. Wait, no, because momentum is mass times velocity times a unit vector in direction. So since they're in opposite directions, their magnitudes must satisfy m_p v_p = m_e v_e. So m_p v_p = m_e v_e, which gives v_e = (m_p / m_e) v_p. Since m_p = 1836 m_e, v_e = (1836 m_e / m_e) v_p = 1836 v_p. So the electron's speed is 1836 times that of the proton. That seems fast, but makes sense because the electron is much lighter, so it gets a higher speed to conserve momentum.

Now, the kinetic energy (KE) of each particle is (1/2) m v². So KE_p = ½ m_p v_p², and KE_e = ½ m_e v_e².

We can express KE_e in terms of v_p. Since v_e = 1836 v_p, then v_e² = (1836)^2 v_p².

So KE_e = ½ m_e (1836)^2 v_p² = ½ m_e * (1836²) v_p².

But we can express KE_p as ½ m_p v_p² = ½ (1836 m_e) v_p².

So, the ratio of KE_e to KE_p would be (½ m_e * 1836² v_p²) / (½ (1836 m_e) v_p²) ) = (m_e * 1836² ) / (1836 m_e) ) = 1836.

Wait, that's KE_e = 1836 * KE_p. So the electron's kinetic energy is much larger than the proton's. But wait, that can't be right, because the proton is much heavier. Wait, no, because in KE, the lighter particle (electron) would have a higher speed and higher kinetic energy.

But wait, let me double-check that. The ratio comes out as KE_e = 1836 KE_p. So the ratio of KE_p to total KE would be KE_p/(KE_p + KE_e) = KE_p/(KE_p + 1836 KE_p) ) = 1/(1 + 1836) = 1/1837 ≈ 0.000544.

Wait, but that's the fraction of the total energy going into the proton's KE. So approximately 0.0544%? Wait, 1/1837 is approximately 0.000544, which is 0.0544% of the total energy. Looking at the options, option D is 0.000544, and option I is 0.0544, which would be 0.0544 as a decimal, which is 5.44%, but that's not matching. Hmm, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me go through the steps again.

1. Momentum conservation: m_p v_p = m_e v_e → v_e = (m_p / m_e) v_p = 1836 v_p.

2. KE_p = ½ m_p v_p².

3. KE_e = ½ m_e v_e² = ½ m_e (1836 v_p)^2 = ½ m_e * 1836² v_p².

4. Ratio of KE_e to KE_p: (½ m_e * 1836² v_p²) / (½ m_p v_p²) ) = (m_e * 1836²) / (m_p) → since m_p = 1836 m_e, this becomes (m_e * 1836²) / (1836 m_e) ) = 1836.

So KE_e = 1836 KE_p.

Total KE = KE_p + KE_e = KE_p (1 + 1836) = 1837 KE_p.

Therefore, the fraction of the total energy that goes into the proton is KE_p / (1837 KE_p) ) = 1/1837 ≈ 0.000544.

So the answer should be option D: 0.000544.

Wait, but looking back at the options, D is 0.000544, which is 5.44e-4. So that's correct.

So the correct answer is D.
</think>

The neutron decays into a proton and an electron, with the total energy released appearing as the kinetic energy of the two particles. Using momentum conservation, the proton and electron must have equal and opposite momenta, leading to the relation \( v_e = 1836 v_p \), where \( v_p \) and \( v_e \) are their velocities. The kinetic energy of each particle is proportional to \( m v^2 \), so the electron's kinetic energy is 1836 times that of the proton. The total kinetic energy is the sum of both, making the proton's kinetic energy a fraction \( \frac{1}{1837} \) of the total, which is approximately \( 0.000544 \).
