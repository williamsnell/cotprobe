Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this economics problem about Robin's nominal and real income in Sherwood. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the problem says that the average price level in Sherwood tripled during a certain period. That means prices went up by a factor of three. So, if something used to cost $1, now it costs $3. This is a significant increase in inflation.

Next, Robin's income increased from $30,000 to $60,000. So, at first glance, it looks like Robin is earning twice as much. But I need to consider how this relates to both nominal and real income.

Nominal income is the actual money income that Robin earns, without adjusting for inflation. So, if Robin's income went from $30k to $60k, the nominal income definitely increased. That part seems straightforward.

Now, real income is what's important because it's adjusted for the price level. It's the purchasing power Robin has. The formula for real income is usually Nominal Income divided by the Price Level. Since the price level tripled, the denominator becomes three times larger.

Let's calculate Robin's real income before and after. Initially, real income was $30,000 / 1 (let's assume the initial price level is 1 for simplicity). After the change, nominal income is $60,000, but the price level is 3. So real income becomes $60,000 / 3 = $20,000. Wait, that can't be right because $20k is less than the original $30k. That would mean real income decreased. But that doesn't make sense because Robin's nominal income doubled, but prices increased more.

Wait, maybe I should think about it differently. When prices triple, each dollar's purchasing power is reduced by a third. So, if Robin's income doubled to $60k, but prices went up three times, what's the real income?

Let me try another approach. Real income = Nominal Income / Price Level. Initially, real income was 30k / 1 = 30k. After, it's 60k / 3 = 20k. So real income decreased from 30k to 20k. That means Robin's real income went down.

But wait, that seems counterintuitive because Robin's nominal income doubled, but prices went up even more. So, in real terms, Robin is worse off. So, real income decreased.

Wait a second, maybe I'm miscalculating. Let me think again. If prices tripled, each unit of money is worth less. So, Robin's $60k now buys what $20k would have bought before the price increase. So yes, real income decreased.

So, nominal income increased (from 30k to 60k), but real income decreased because the price level increased more than the income.

Looking back at the options, I need to find where Nominal is Increased and Real is Decreased. Let's look at the options:

Option F: (A) Increased     Decreased. Wait, the options are labeled A through J, but the answers have letters like (G), etc. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options, each option is labeled from A to J, and each has two parts: the first for nominal, the second for real.

Option F says: (A) Increased     Decreased. So, nominal increased, real decreased. That matches my conclusion.

Wait, but let me double-check. Did I get the real income right? So, initial real income: 30k. After, real income is 60k / 3 = 20k. So, yes, real income decreased.

So the correct answer should be Option F, which is (A) Increased for nominal and (F) Decreased for real income. Wait, no. Wait, the options are structured as:

Each option is a letter (A-J) with two parts: the first is nominal, the second real.

Looking at the options:

A: (G) Stayed the same     Increased
B: (B) Increased     Increased
C: (D) Increased     Stayed the same
D: (J) Increased     Fluctuated
E: (F) Stayed the same     Decreased
F: (A) Increased     Decreased
G: (C) Decreased     Decreased
H: (I) Stayed the same     Stayed the same
I: (H) Decreased     Stayed the same
J: (E) Decreased     Increased

Wait, the options are structured as each letter (A-J) with two parts. For example, option F is labeled (A) Increased for nominal and (F) Decreased for real. Wait, no, perhaps I misread. Let me clarify.

Each option letter (A to J) corresponds to two answers, with the first being nominal and the second real. For example, option F is: (A) Increased     Decreased. So the first part is (A) which is "Increased" for nominal, and the second part is (F) which is "Decreased" for real.

Wait, no, perhaps the way it's written is that each option is a pair, like:

A: Nominal stayed same, real increased.

B: Both increased.

C: Nominal increased, real stayed same.

D: Nominal increased, real fluctuated.

E: Nominal stayed same, real decreased.

F: Nominal increased, real decreased.

So, looking for Nominal: Increased, Real: Decreased. That's option F.

Yes, that's correct. So the answer should be option F, which is (A) Increased for nominal and (F) Decreased for real. But wait, the way the options are written is confusing. Let me make sure.

Wait, perhaps the options are presented as:

Each option is a letter, and the two parts are the possible choices for nominal and real. For example, option F is "Increased" for nominal and "Decreased" for real.

Yes, that's right. So the correct choice is F: (A) Increased     (F) Decreased, which corresponds to Nominal Income Increased and Real Income Decreased.

The average price level in Sherwood tripled, meaning prices increased by 300%. Robin's nominal income doubled from $30,000 to $60,000. However, real income, which is nominal income adjusted for inflation, decreased because the price level increased more than the income. 

Answer: F
