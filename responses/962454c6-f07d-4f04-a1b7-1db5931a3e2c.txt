D: Ijwk
E: Ikkj

Okay, so I've got this predicate logic question here, and I need to figure out the right translation. Let me start by understanding the sentence and the notation involved.

The sentence is: "Kevin is introduced to José by Wilma." The variables are j for José, k for Kevin, and w for Wilma. The predicate Ixyz means that x introduces y to z.

So, breaking down the sentence: Wilma is the one introducing Kevin to José. That means the introducer is Wilma, the person being introduced is Kevin, and the person to whom Kevin is introduced is José.

Looking at the predicate Ixyz, the order is x introduces y to z. So x is the introducer, y is the one being introduced, and z is the person being introduced to.

In the sentence, the structure is: [Introducer] is [action] [introducee] to [introduced to]. So, Introducer is Wilma (w), introducee is Kevin (k), and introduced to is José (j). So the predicate should be I(w, k, j).

Now, looking at the options:

A: Ijkw → I(j, k, w) → José introduces Kevin to Wilma. That's not right because Wilma is the introducer.

B: Iwjw → I(w, j, w) → Wilma introduces José to Wilma. No, because Kevin is the one being introduced.

C: Iwjk → I(w, j, k) → Wilma introduces José to Kevin. Wait, that's the opposite of what we need. The sentence says Kevin is introduced to José by Wilma, so Kevin is the one being introduced, and José is the one being introduced to. So the predicate should be I(w, k, j). Option C is I(w, j, k), which would mean Wilma introduces José to Kevin, which is the reverse.

D: Ijwk → I(j, w, k) → José introduces Wilma to Kevin. No, because the introducer is Wilma.

E: Ikkj → I(k, k, j) → Kevin introduces Kevin to José. Not correct.

F: Ijjk → I(j, j, k) → José introduces José to Kevin. No.

G: Iwwk → I(w, w, k) → Wilma introduces Wilma to Kevin. No.

H: Ikjw → I(k, j, w) → Kevin introduces José to Wilma. No, because Wilma is the introducer.

I: Iwkj → I(w, k, j) → Wilma introduces Kevin to José. Yes, this matches the sentence.

Wait, earlier I thought option C was Iwjk, which is I(w, j, k), which is not correct. So the correct one should be I(w, k, j), which is option I: Iwkj.

The correct translation is I(w, k, j), which corresponds to option I.

Answer: I
