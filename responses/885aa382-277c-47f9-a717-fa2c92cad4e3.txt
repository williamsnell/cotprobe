Okay, so I've got this problem here about calculating the cost to cover a floor with asphalt tiles. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

First, the floor dimensions are 13 feet 6 inches by 18 feet 8 inches. I need to convert these measurements into inches because the tile size is given in inches. I remember that 1 foot is 12 inches, so:

13 feet 6 inches is equal to (13 * 12) + 6 inches. Let me calculate that. 13 times 12 is 156, plus 6 is 162 inches. Similarly, 18 feet 8 inches is (18 * 12) + 8. 18 times 12 is 216, plus 8 is 224 inches. So the floor area is 162 inches by 224 inches.

Now, the cost per tile is 9 and 3/4 cents per 9" tile. Wait, 9 3/4 cents is the same as 9.75 cents per tile. So each tile costs 9.75 cents. 

But wait, tiles are usually sold in standard sizes, so I should figure out how many 9" tiles I need to cover the floor. But first, I need to figure out how to compute the number of tiles. 

Alternatively, maybe I can compute the area of one tile and then see how many fit into the floor area. Let me outline the steps:

1. Convert the floor area from feet and inches to square inches.
2. Find the area of one tile.
3. Divide the total floor area by the tile area to get the number of tiles needed.
4. Multiply the number of tiles by the cost per tile to get the total cost.

Wait, let me think. Alternatively, maybe it's easier to convert the floor dimensions into inches, then figure out how many tiles fit along each dimension.

So step 1: Convert to inches.

Floor dimensions in inches are 162x224. 

Each tile is 9" on a side, so each tile covers 9x9 = 81 square inches.

But wait, wait a second. No, that's not right. Because each tile is 9" in size, and if you place them in a grid, the number of tiles along each dimension would be the total length divided by the tile size. 

But wait, the tiles are square? Or are they square and rectangular? The problem says 9" tiles, so I think they're square, each 9" on each side.

So for each dimension, I need to find how many 9" tiles fit. 

So 162 inches divided by 9 inches per tile is 162/9 = 18 tiles along the length.

Similarly, 224 inches divided by 9 inches is 224/9. Let me calculate that. 224 divided by 9 is approximately 24.888... So that's 24 full tiles and a remainder. Since you can't have a fraction of a tile, we'd need to round up. So 25 tiles along the width.

Wait, no, wait. Let me double-check. 9 times 24 is 216, which leaves 224 - 216 = 8 inches remaining. So yes, 24 full tiles and a 8" tile needed. So total number of tiles would be 18 (length) * 25 (width) = 450 tiles. 

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the tiles can be arranged in a way that covers more efficiently. But for the purposes of this problem, perhaps the calculation is as simple as doing the number of tiles along each dimension. So 162 inches is 18 tiles, and 224 inches is 24.888... which rounds up to 25. So 18 * 25 = 450 tiles.

Each tile is 9" x 9" and costs 9.75 cents. So the total cost is 450 * 9.75 cents.

Wait, 450 * 9.75. Let me compute that.

9.75 * 450: I can think of 10 *450 = 4500, subtract 0.25 *450 = 112.5. So 4500 - 112.5 = 4387.5 cents.

4387.5 cents is $43.875, which is approximately $43.88. Looking at the options, option G is $43.88. So the answer would be G.

Wait, but let me check my calculations again. Maybe I made a mistake in the number of tiles.

Wait, 162 inches divided by 9 inches per tile gives exactly 18 tiles. Correct. 224 divided by 9 is 24.888..., so 25 tiles. So 18 * 25 is 450, correct.

Each tile is 9c, so 450 *9=4050 cents. 4050 /100= $40.50. Wait, but wait no, wait our per tile cost was 9.75 cents, right? So 9.75 *450 = 4387.5 cents, which is $43.875, so $43.88.

Wait, but the options include G as $43.88. So that's the answer.

Wait, but let me think if the tile size is 9" per tile, is that 9 inches per side, so 9" x 9", or is it 9 square feet? No, the problem says 9 (3/4) cents per 9" tile. So each tile is 9" x9" and costs 9.75 cents.

So yes, 450 tiles, 9.75 cents each. 450 *9.75 cents is 4387.5, which is $43.88.

But wait, wait a second. Another way: Maybe I should compute the area in square feet and see how many 9" tiles fit into that area.

Wait, let me try that approach to check.

The floor area is 13'6" by 18'8". Let's convert that to square feet.

First, 13'6" is 13.5 feet. 18'8" is 18.666... feet.

So area is 13.5 *18.666... = let's compute that. 13 *18 is 234, 13 *0.666 is about 8.66, 0.5 *18.666 is 9.333, 0.5 *0.666 is 0.333. So adding all up: 234 +8.66 +9.333 +0.333 ≈ 252.323 square feet.

Each 9" tile is 0.75 feet on each side (since 9 inches is 0.75 feet). So area per tile is 0.75² = 0.5625 square feet.

Now, number of tiles needed is total area / area per tile.

252.323 / 0.5625 ≈ let's compute that.

252.323 divided by 0.5625. Let's see, 0.5625 is 9/16. So 252.323 * (16/9) ≈ 252.323 *1.7777 ≈ approx 252.323 *1.7777.

But maybe it's easier to compute 252.323 / 0.5625.

0.5625 goes into 252 how many times?

Well, 0.5625 * 450 = 253.125. Because 0.5625 *400=225, 0.5625*50=28.125, so 225+28.125=253.125. So 450 tiles would cover 253.125 sq ft, which is a bit more than 252.323. So 450 tiles would give us just over the needed area. So yes, 450 tiles is enough.

So 450 tiles at 9.75 cents each is 450 *9.75 =4387.5 cents, which is $43.88.

So the correct answer should be option G.
</think>

The correct answer is G: $43.88.

The calculation is as follows:

1. Convert floor dimensions to inches:
   - 13'6" = (13 × 12) + 6 = 162 inches
   - 18'8" = (18 × 12) + 8 = 224 inches

2. Calculate the area of one 9" tile:
   - Area = 9 inches × 9 inches = 81 square inches

3. Calculate the number of tiles needed along each dimension:
   - Length: 162 / 9 = 18 tiles
   - Width: 224 / 9 ≈ 24.888... → 25 tiles (round up)

4. Total number of tiles = 18 × 25 = 450 tiles

5. Calculate total cost:
   - Each tile costs 9.75 cents → 450 × 9.75 = 4387.5 cents = $43.88
