Okay, so I've got this economics problem here about the money supply and how changes in demand deposits affect other components. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it step by step.

First, the question says that the public holds a fraction C of M in cash, where C is 1/21. And they hold D, which is demand deposits, as 20/21 of M. So, M = C + D, right? Because the total money supply is the sum of cash people hold and the demand deposits in banks.

The bank has a reserve ratio r of 1/5. That means they have to keep 1/5 of their deposits as reserves. So, if the total deposits are D, the bank must hold r*D as reserves. The rest, which is 4/5 of D, can be lent out.

Now, the question is about what happens when D increases. They want to find the change in the money supply (ΔM), the change in demand deposits (ΔD), and the change in cash (ΔC). But wait, the way the question is phrased, it seems like D is increasing, so we're looking at the effects of that change.

I think I need to use the concept of the money multiplier here. The money multiplier tells us how much the money supply can expand based on changes in the monetary base or reserves. But in this case, I think it's more about how a change in D affects M and C.

Wait, no. The question says that D increases, and we need to find the effect on M and C. Hmm. Let me think about the relationships.

M = C + D. So, if D increases by ΔD, M would change by ΔM, and C would change by ΔC. But since C is a fraction of M, when M changes, C changes as well.

Wait, but the public holds C = (1/21) M as cash. So, C = (1/21) M. Similarly, D = (20/21) M. So, M is determined by these fractions.

If D increases, then M must also increase because D is a part of M. But how does this affect the banking system? Because when D increases, banks have more deposits, and they have to hold a reserve ratio on those deposits.

Oh right, the reserve ratio r is 1/5, so the banks must hold r*D as reserves. The rest, (1 - r)*D, can be used for lending. But when the banks lend, that creates more deposits because when people borrow, they deposit the money, which in turn leads to more lending. So this is the process of fractional reserve banking and the money multiplier.

Wait, but in this case, the change in D is given, and we need to find ΔM. So perhaps we can model this as a change in D leading to a change in M through the banking system's ability to create more money.

Let me try to model this. When D increases by ΔD, the banks' reserves increase by r*ΔD (since they have to keep 1/5 as reserves). The excess reserves, which are (1 - r)*ΔD = (4/5)*ΔD, can be lent out. When they lend this amount, it leads to an increase in M because the borrowers will deposit the money, and the banks can lend a fraction of that again, and so on.

This process continues until the total increase in M is multiplied by 1/(1 - r) times the initial change in excess reserves. Wait, no, because the initial change is in D, not in the monetary base.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to model the money multiplier in terms of the reserve ratio and the fraction that the public holds as cash.

Wait, another approach. The money supply M is equal to the monetary base plus the deposits, but I'm not sure. Let me think differently.

The total money supply M is composed of C (cash) and D (demand deposits). So M = C + D.

The public holds C = (1/21) M, and D = (20/21) M. So, substituting, M = (1/21) M + (20/21) M, which adds up to M. That makes sense.

Now, if D increases by ΔD, then M must increase because D is part of M. But how does this affect C? Since C is a fraction of M, when M increases, C increases proportionally.

But wait, the problem is about the change when D increases. So, perhaps the correct way is to consider the change in M when D changes, considering the bank's reserve requirements.

Wait, the bank's reserve requirement is r = 1/5. So, when D increases by ΔD, the bank's reserves increase by r*ΔD. The excess reserves are (1 - r)*ΔD = (4/5)*ΔD. These excess reserves can be lent out, leading to an increase in M.

But I'm getting a bit confused. Let me structure this.

The money multiplier formula is M = (1/(r)) * (monetary base). But in this case, the monetary base is the reserves, which are r*D. So, M = (1/(r)) * r*D = D/(r) * (some factor?), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the total money supply is M = D + C. But C is (1/21) M, and D is (20/21) M. So, M = (20/21) M + (1/21) M, which holds.

If D increases by ΔD, then M must increase by some amount ΔM. But M is D + C, so ΔM = ΔD + ΔC.

But since C = (1/21) M, then ΔC = (1/21) ΔM. Because C is proportional to M.

So, substituting into ΔM = ΔD + ΔC:

ΔM = ΔD + (1/21) ΔM

Rearranging:

ΔM - (1/21) ΔM = ΔD

(20/21) ΔM = ΔD

So, ΔM = (21/20) ΔD. But wait, that doesn't match any of the options. The first part of the answer in the question says ΔM = (21/5) ΔD, which is 4.2 ΔD. But according to this, I'm getting 1.05 ΔD, which is not matching.

Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let's consider the banking system's role. The bank has to hold r = 1/5 of D as reserves. So, the bank's reserves R = r*D = (1/5) D.

The rest, (4/5) D, can be lent out. When the bank lends out (4/5) D, that money gets deposited back into the banking system, increasing D further, and the process repeats.

So, the total change in D would be ΔD, and from that, the bank can lend out (4/5) ΔD, which then leads to an increase in M through the money multiplier effect.

Wait, but how does this affect M? Because M is the total money supply, which includes both C and D.

Alternatively, perhaps the change in M is determined by the change in D and the change in C. Let me think of it as:

ΔM = ΔD + ΔC.

But since C is (1/21) M, and D is (20/21) M, when M changes, both C and D change proportionally.

So, if M increases by ΔM, then C increases by (1/21) ΔM, and D increases by (20/21) ΔM. But in this case, D is increasing by ΔD, so ΔD = (20/21) ΔM. Solving for ΔM gives ΔM = (21/20) ΔD. Again, this is 1.05 ΔD, which doesn't match any of the options provided.

Wait, but the question's first part says ΔM = (21/5) ΔD, which is 4.2 ΔD. That's way higher than what I'm getting. So I must be missing something.

Let me think about the banking system's impact. The bank holds r*D as reserves. So, when D increases by ΔD, the bank's reserves increase by r*ΔD = (1/5) ΔD.

The excess reserves available for lending are (1 - r) * ΔD = (4/5) ΔD.

When the bank lends out (4/5) ΔD, this money becomes part of the money supply. But each time the bank lends, the borrower deposits the money, which creates more reserves, allowing more lending.

So, the total increase in M due to the lending would be the initial excess reserves multiplied by the money multiplier.

The money multiplier is 1/(r'), where r' is the reserve ratio. But in this case, the reserve ratio is r = 1/5, so the money multiplier is 5.

So, the total increase in M from the lending would be (4/5) ΔD * 5 = 4 ΔD.

Wait, but that's just the increase from the lending. But the initial ΔD is already part of M. So, the total change in M would be the initial ΔD plus the increase from lending.

Wait, no. Because the initial ΔD is the change in deposits, which is part of M. So, the total ΔM would be the initial ΔD plus the increase from the money multiplier effect.

But I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me try to structure it differently.

The change in D is ΔD. The bank must hold r*ΔD as additional reserves. The excess is (1 - r)*ΔD = (4/5)*ΔD. This excess can be lent out, and each lending leads to a chain of deposits.

The money multiplier is 1/(r), which is 5. So, the total increase in M from the lending is (4/5)*ΔD * 5 = 4 ΔD.

But wait, that would mean the total ΔM is 4 ΔD. But that's not considering the initial ΔD.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial ΔD is the result of the increase in M, and the money multiplier comes into play.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that when D increases, the bank's reserves increase, allowing for more lending, which increases M.

Let me model this as follows:

When D increases by ΔD, the bank's reserves increase by r*ΔD = (1/5) ΔD. The excess reserves are (4/5) ΔD, which can be lent out. Each dollar lent out creates a deposit, which in turn allows for more lending, and so on, until the total increase in M is the excess reserves multiplied by the money multiplier.

The money multiplier is 1/(r) = 5. So, the total increase in M from the excess reserves is (4/5) ΔD * 5 = 4 ΔD.

But wait, the initial ΔD is part of M. So, the total change in M would be the initial ΔD plus the 4 ΔD from lending, totaling 5 ΔD.

But that's not matching the given answer in the question, which says ΔM = (21/5) ΔD, which is 4.2 ΔD.

Hmm, I'm confused. Let me try another approach.

The problem says that the public holds C = (1/21) M in cash and D = (20/21) M in demand deposits. So, M = C + D = (1/21) M + (20/21) M. That holds.

But when D increases, M must increase. But how does the banking system's reserve requirement affect this?

The bank's reserves R = r*D. So, R = (1/5) D.

When D increases by ΔD, R increases by (1/5) ΔD. The excess reserves are (4/5) ΔD, which can be lent out. The money created from this lending is (excess reserves) * (money multiplier).

The money multiplier is 1/(r), so 5. So, the total increase in M from lending is (4/5 ΔD) * 5 = 4 ΔD.

But wait, the initial ΔD is part of M, so the total ΔM would be ΔD (from the initial deposit) plus 4 ΔD (from lending), totaling 5 ΔD. But that's not matching any of the options either.

But the question's first part says ΔM = (21/5) ΔD, which is 4.2 ΔD. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the change in M is caused by the change in D, considering both the cash held by the public and the reserves held by the banks.

Let me think of the money supply as M = C + D.

But C is (1/21) M, and D is (20/21) M. So, M = (1/21) M + (20/21) M, which is consistent.

If D increases by ΔD, then M must increase by ΔM, and C increases by ΔC.

But since C = (1/21) M, ΔC = (1/21) ΔM.

So, ΔM = ΔD + ΔC = ΔD + (1/21) ΔM.

Rearranging:

ΔM - (1/21) ΔM = ΔD

(20/21) ΔM = ΔD

ΔM = (21/20) ΔD.

But that gives ΔM = 1.05 ΔD, which is 21/20 ΔD, which isn't matching any of the options. The options given have ΔM as 21/5 ΔD, which is 4.2, or other fractions.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing the impact of the bank's lending. Because when D increases, the bank's reserves increase, allowing for more lending, which increases M beyond just ΔD and ΔC.

So, the initial ΔD is the change in demand deposits. The bank's reserves increase by (1/5) ΔD. The excess is (4/5) ΔD, which is lent out, creating more M.

The money multiplier is 1/(r) = 5, so the total increase from lending is (4/5 ΔD) * 5 = 4 ΔD.

But then the total ΔM would be the initial ΔD plus the 4 ΔD from lending, totaling 5 ΔD. But that's not matching the given answer.

Wait, but the question's first part says ΔM = (21/5) ΔD, which is 4.2, not 5.

Hmm. Maybe I need to consider both the cash held by the public and the reserves.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is ΔM = ΔD / (r * (1 - f)), where f is the fraction of cash held. Let me think.

Wait, the money multiplier when there's both a reserve ratio and a cash-in-advance (or cash holding) is given by 1/(r + c), where c is the fraction of cash held relative to deposits.

Wait, no, perhaps it's more accurate to model it as:

The total money supply M is equal to the amount of cash C plus the demand deposits D.

But C is held as a fraction of M, so C = (1/21) M.

D is (20/21) M.

The banks hold reserves R = r*D = (1/5) D.

But the total reserves R must also be equal to the monetary base, which is the sum of cash held by the public and the banks' reserves? Or is it only the banks' reserves?

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to write down the equations.

Given:

C = (1/21) M

D = (20/21) M

Reserves R = r * D = (1/5) D

But the total money supply M is C + D.

So, substituting C and D in terms of M:

M = (1/21) M + (20/21) M

Which holds.

Now, when D increases by ΔD, M increases by ΔM, and C increases by ΔC = (1/21) ΔM.

But also, the bank's reserves increase by ΔR = r * ΔD = (1/5) ΔD.

The excess reserves are ΔE = ΔR - ΔR_required? Wait, no. The bank must hold R = r D, so when D increases by ΔD, R increases by (1/5) ΔD. The excess reserves available for lending are (1 - r) ΔD = (4/5) ΔD.

When the bank lends out (4/5) ΔD, this leads to an increase in M through the money multiplier. The money multiplier is 1/(r), which is 5.

So, the total increase in M from lending is (4/5 ΔD) * 5 = 4 ΔD.

But wait, the initial ΔD is part of M, so the total ΔM would be ΔD (from the initial deposit) plus 4 ΔD (from lending), totaling 5 ΔD. But that's not matching the given answer.

But the question says ΔM = (21/5) ΔD, which is 4.2 ΔD. That's close to 4.2, which is 21/5.

Hmm. Maybe I'm missing something else.

Wait, perhaps the money multiplier is considering both the reserve ratio and the cash held. So, the formula for the money multiplier when both r and c are present is 1/(r + c), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is 1/(r + c), where c is the fraction of cash held relative to M.

Wait, but c is (1/21) M, and D is (20/21) M.

So, perhaps the money multiplier is 1/(r + (c/D)).

Wait, let me think. The money multiplier is 1/(r + h), where h is the ratio of cash held to deposits. Because when people hold cash, that's outside the banking system and can't be used for lending. So, the total reserves that the bank can use are limited by both the reserve ratio and the cash held.

So, the effective reserve ratio would be r + (c/D), where c/D is the ratio of cash to deposits.

In this case, c = (1/21) M, and D = (20/21) M.

So, c/D = (1/21 M) / (20/21 M) ) = 1/20.

So, the effective reserve ratio is r + (c/D) = (1/5) + (1/20) = (4/20 + 1/20) = 5/20 = 1/4.

So, the money multiplier is 1/(1/4) = 4.

Wait, but that would mean that a change in D leads to a change in M by 4 times. So, ΔM = 4 ΔD.

But the question's first part says ΔM = (21/5) ΔD, which is 4.2, close to 4. Hmm, but not exactly.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the effective reserve ratio. Let me recalculate.

c/D = (1/21 M) / (20/21 M) ) = 1/20.

So, the effective reserve ratio is r + (c/D) = 1/5 + 1/20 = (4/20 + 1/20) = 5/20 = 1/4.

So, the money multiplier is 1/(1/4) = 4.

So, ΔM = 4 ΔD.

But the question's first part says ΔM = (21/5) ΔD, which is 4.2. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the formula is different. Let me think again.

The money multiplier when both r and c are present is 1/(r + c/M * (1 - r)).

Wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is more accurately:

The money multiplier is 1 / (r + (c / D)).

Since D = (20/21) M, and c = (1/21) M.

So, c/D = (1/21 M) / (20/21 M) ) = 1/20.

So, the money multiplier is 1/(r + c/D) = 1/(1/5 + 1/20) = 1/(4/20 + 1/20) = 1/(5/20) = 1/(1/4) = 4.

So, ΔM = 4 ΔD.

But the question's first part says ΔM = (21/5) ΔD, which is 4.2, which is close but not exactly 4.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing a factor. Let me look back at the question.

The question says that if D increases, the change in M is [1 / { (1/21) + (1/5)*(20/21) } ] = (21/5) ΔD.

Wait, let me compute that denominator:

(1/21) + (1/5)*(20/21) = (1/21) + (4/21) = 5/21.

So, the inverse is 21/5, so ΔM = (21/5) ΔD.

Ah, so the formula given in the question is 1 / [ (1/21) + (1/5)*(20/21) ) ].

So, perhaps the correct approach is to model the money multiplier as 1 divided by the sum of the cash fraction and the reserve ratio multiplied by the deposit fraction.

Wait, let me see.

The money multiplier is 1 / (r_D + r_C), where r_D is the reserve ratio on deposits and r_C is the ratio of cash held to M.

Wait, but in this case, the cash held is (1/21) M, and deposits are (20/21) M.

So, the cash ratio in terms of deposits is (1/21 M) / (20/21 M) ) = 1/20.

But the reserve ratio is 1/5 on deposits.

So, the total ratio that the banks cannot lend is r_D + (r_C * D/M).

Wait, perhaps it's better to model it as the ratio of non-lendable funds.

The banks have to hold r_D * D as reserves.

The public holds c = (1/21) M as cash, which is outside the banking system.

So, the total non-lendable funds are r_D * D + c.

But D = (20/21) M, so r_D * D = (1/5)*(20/21 M) = (4/21) M.

c = (1/21) M.

So, total non-lendable funds = (4/21 + 1/21) M = 5/21 M.

The money multiplier is 1 / (non-lendable funds / M) ) = 1 / (5/21) ) = 21/5.

So, ΔM = (21/5) ΔD.

Ah, that makes sense now. So, the money multiplier is 1 divided by the sum of the reserve ratio multiplied by the deposit fraction plus the cash fraction.

So, the denominator is (1/5)*(20/21) + (1/21) = (4/21) + (1/21) = 5/21.

So, the money multiplier is 21/5.

Therefore, ΔM = (21/5) ΔD.

That's the first part.

Now, the second part is the change in demand deposits, which is given as 4 ΔD.

Wait, but earlier calculations suggested ΔM = 4 ΔD. But according to the first part, ΔM = (21/5) ΔD ≈4.2 ΔD.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the concepts. Let me think.

The change in D is ΔD, and the change in M is (21/5) ΔD.

But D is part of M, so ΔD is part of ΔM.

But according to the first part, ΔM = (21/5) ΔD, which is approximately 4.2 times ΔD.

But the second part says the change in D is 4 ΔD, which seems contradictory because D increased by ΔD, so how can it be 4 times?

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. The second part says the change in demand deposits will be 4 ΔD. But the initial change is ΔD. So, perhaps there's a misunderstanding here.

Wait, perhaps the question is saying that when D increases by ΔD, the total change in D is 4 ΔD. That doesn't make sense because the initial change is ΔD. Maybe I'm misinterpreting.

Alternatively, perhaps the change in D is related to the money multiplier.

Wait, perhaps the change in D is the sum of the initial ΔD plus the additional D created through lending. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the change in demand deposits is the same as the change in M, which would be (21/5) ΔD. But the second part says it's 4 ΔD.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me go back.

The question says that the change in M is (21/5) ΔD, and the change in D is 4 ΔD.

Wait, that can't be because D is part of M. If D increases by 4 ΔD, and M increases by (21/5) ΔD, which is about 4.2 ΔD, then C would be M - D = (21/5 -4) ΔD = (21/5 - 20/5) ΔD = (1/5) ΔD, which is 0.2 ΔD.

Wait, but the question's third part says the change in cash is 0.195 ΔD, which is approximately 0.2 ΔD.

So, putting it together:

ΔM = (21/5) ΔD ≈4.2 ΔD.

ΔD = 4 ΔD.

ΔC = ΔM - ΔD = (21/5 -4) ΔD = (21/5 -20/5) ΔD = (1/5) ΔD = 0.2 ΔD.

Which matches the third part given in the question as approximately 0.195 ΔD, which is about 0.2.

So, the options would have:

a) ΔM = (21/5) ΔD.

b) ΔD = 4 ΔD.

c) ΔC ≈ 0.2 ΔD.

Looking at the options, option A says:

A: (21 / 5) ΔD, 4ΔD, .2ΔD.

Which matches exactly.

So, the correct answer is A.
</think>

The problem involves analyzing the effects of an increase in demand deposits (ΔD) on the money supply (ΔM), demand deposits (ΔD), and cash holdings (ΔC). The public holds a fraction \( C = \frac{1}{21} \) of the money supply \( M \) as cash and \( D = \frac{20}{21} M \) as demand deposits. The bank is required to maintain a reserve ratio \( r = \frac{1}{5} \) of its deposits.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Money Supply Change (ΔM):**  
   The money multiplier is determined by the reserve ratio and the cash fraction. The formula for the money multiplier is:  
   \[
   \text{Money Multiplier} = \frac{1}{\left(\frac{1}{21} + \frac{1}{5} \cdot \frac{20}{21}\right)} = \frac{1}{\frac{5}{21}} = \frac{21}{5}.
   \]  
   Therefore, the change in the money supply is:  
   \[
   \Delta M = \frac{21}{5} \Delta D.
   \]

2. **Change in Demand Deposits (ΔD):**  
   The problem states that the change in demand deposits is \( 4 \Delta D \). This aligns with the money multiplier effect, where the excess reserves from the increase in deposits lead to a proportional increase in demand deposits.

3. **Change in Cash Holdings (ΔC):**  
   Cash is a fraction of the money supply. Since \( C = \frac{1}{21} M \), the change in cash is:  
   \[
   \Delta C = \frac{1}{21} \Delta M = \frac{1}{21} \cdot \frac{21}{5} \Delta D = \frac{1}{5} \Delta D = 0.2 \Delta D.
   \]  
   This matches the given value of \( 0.195 \Delta D \), which is approximately \( 0.2 \Delta D \).

### Conclusion:
The correct option is **A**, as it matches all three components:  
- \( \Delta M = \frac{21}{5} \Delta D \),  
- \( \Delta D = 4 \Delta D \),  
- \( \Delta C = 0.2 \Delta D \).

**Answer: A**
