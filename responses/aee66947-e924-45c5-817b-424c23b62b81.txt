Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about Darwin and which statement he would have rejected. Let's break it down.

The question is asking which statement Darwin would have rejected. The options are A, B, and C. I need to consider each one carefully.

Option A: Environmental change plays a role in evolution. Well, Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection does involve environmental factors influencing which traits are selected. So he definitely accepted that environmental change affects evolution. So A is probably not the right answer.

Option B: The smallest entity that can evolve is an individual organism. Hmm. Darwin focused on natural selection acting on individual organisms. He didn't consider things like cells or genes as units of evolution because that concept came later with ideas like the gene-centered view of evolution. So Darwin would have seen the individual as the unit, but modern theory might go smaller. So would he have rejected this statement? Wait, the question is what he would have rejected. If he thought the individual is the smallest, but actually, that's what he believed, so B might be a statement he agreed with, so it's not the answer.

Option C: Inherited variation in a population is a necessary precondition for natural selection to operate. Darwin knew about variation, but he didn't know the source. He observed that variation existed, and natural selection acts on that. So he would have agreed that inherited variation is necessary for natural selection. Therefore, C is something he accepted, so not the answer.

Wait, but the question is which statement he would have rejected. So let's think again. Did he reject any of these?

Wait, looking back. Option B says the smallest entity is an individual. But in modern terms, some argue that evolution can happen at lower levels, like the gene level. But Darwin's time didn't have that understanding. He would have considered the individual as the unit. So if someone says the smallest is the individual, he would agree, so he wouldn't reject it. So perhaps the answer is B, because he might not have considered anything smaller, but the question is about what he would have rejected. Alternatively, maybe there's a different angle.

Wait, perhaps the question is about whether the individual is the only unit. But the statement is about the smallest entity that can evolve. So if the correct answer is that the individual is not the smallest, then Darwin would have rejected the statement. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is B because Darwin didn't consider lower levels, but the statement is true if the smallest is, say, a gene. But I'm getting confused.

Wait, let me think again. The options are:

A: Environmental change plays a role in evolution. Darwin would agree.

B: The smallest entity that can evolve is an individual organism. Darwin's theory didn't consider anything smaller, so he would have agreed, so he wouldn't have rejected this statement. Wait, but if the statement is correct, then he didn't reject it. But if the statement is incorrect because smaller entities can evolve, then he would have rejected it because he didn't know about that. So perhaps option B is the one he would have rejected because he didn't consider anything smaller than the individual as the unit of evolution. Or maybe he didn't think about it at all, so he wouldn't have rejected it.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is B because the actual smallest entity is the gene, and Darwin didn't know that, so he would have agreed with B, meaning the answer is B because he would have accepted it, but the question is which he would have rejected. So maybe the answer is J, but wait, the options only go up to C. Wait, the options given are A, B, and C. So perhaps the answer is B, but I'm getting stuck.

Wait, I think I'm overcomplicating. The correct answer is B because the smallest entity is the gene, and Darwin didn't recognize that. So he would have rejected the statement that the smallest is the individual. No, wait, he would have agreed because that's what he thought. So the statement is correct according to his view, so he wouldn't have rejected it. So perhaps the correct answer is another option.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up. Let me think again. The question is which statement Darwin would have rejected. So the correct answer is the one he didn't agree with.

Looking at option B again: The smallest entity that can evolve is an individual organism. If someone says that, and Darwin thought that's true, then the statement is correct, so he wouldn't have rejected it. But if the statement is wrong (because smaller entities can evolve), then he would have rejected it because he didn't know about that. But I'm not sure if that's the case.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is B because Darwin's theory is based on individual organisms, but more recent theories include other levels. So if someone states that the smallest is the individual, Darwin might have agreed, so he wouldn't have rejected it. Therefore, the correct answer is another option.

Wait, perhaps the answer is B because the correct unit is the gene, so the statement is wrong, and Darwin would have rejected it because he didn't think about it. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the answer is B because he didn't consider lower levels, so he would have thought the individual is the smallest, meaning he wouldn't have rejected the statement.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of what each option says and what Darwin believed.

A: Environmental change affects evolution. Darwin agreed.

B: The smallest evolving entity is an individual. Darwin thought in terms of individuals, so he would have agreed.

C: Inherited variation is necessary for natural selection. Darwin knew variation was necessary, so he agreed.

Wait, but the question is which statement he would have rejected. So perhaps none of the options are wrong, but I must have made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps option B is incorrect because the smallest entity is the gene, so Darwin would have rejected the statement that the individual is the smallest, because he didn't know about genes. Wait, but he wouldn't have known to reject it because he didn't know about it. So he would have accepted B as correct.

Hmm, I'm getting confused. Maybe the correct answer is B because the smallest entity is the gene, and Darwin would have rejected the idea that it's the individual. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is B because he didn't think about lower levels, so he would have accepted B as correct, meaning none of the options are wrong. But the question is which he would have rejected, so perhaps none of them, but that can't be.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is B because the individual is not the smallest. So the answer is B. So the final answer is B.

The question asks which statement Darwin would have rejected. Let’s analyze each option:

- **Option A**: Environmental change plays a role in evolution. Darwin’s theory of evolution by natural selection explicitly involves environmental factors influencing which traits are selected. Therefore, Darwin would have accepted this statement, not rejected it.

- **Option B**: The smallest entity that can evolve is an individual organism. Darwin’s theory focused on natural selection acting at the level of individual organisms. He did not consider smaller entities like genes as units of evolution because that concept emerged later. Since Darwin accepted the individual as the unit of evolution, he would not have rejected this statement. However, if the statement is interpreted as implying that nothing smaller than the individual can evolve, Darwin might have rejected it because he did not recognize such lower levels of evolution.

- **Option C**: Inherited variation in a population is a necessary precondition for natural selection to operate. Darwin recognized the importance of variation within populations for natural selection. Therefore, he would have accepted this statement, not rejected it.

Given the analysis, the statement in **Option B** is the one Darwin might have rejected, as he did not consider entities smaller than the individual organism as units of evolution.

Answer: B
