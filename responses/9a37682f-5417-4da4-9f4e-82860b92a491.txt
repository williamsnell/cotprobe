Answer:
    
<think>
Okay, so I have this problem where I need to calculate the volume of air required to completely combust 4 liters of octane gasoline at S.T.P. The given data says that 4 liters of octane weigh 3.19 kg. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that combustion reactions usually involve a hydrocarbon reacting with oxygen to produce carbon dioxide and water. Octane is a common hydrocarbon, so I think its formula is C8H18. So the combustion reaction should be something like:

C8H18 + O2 → CO2 + H2O

I'll need to balance this equation. Let me write it out step by step.

The unbalanced equation is:
C8H18 + O2 → CO2 + H2O

Let me count the atoms on each side. On the left, I have 8 C and 18 H from octane, and O2. On the right, CO2 has 1 C and 2 O each, and H2O has 2 H and 1 O each.

For carbon, I need 8 CO2 molecules to balance the 8 C in octane. So:
C8H18 + O2 → 8 CO2 + H2O

Now for hydrogen, there are 18 H in C8H18, so I need 9 H2O molecules to balance that. So:
C8H18 + O2 → 8 CO2 + 9 H2O

Now, let's balance the oxygens. On the right side, 8 CO2 has 16 O (8×2), and 9 H2O has 9 O, so total O is 25. So O2 on the left must supply 25 O atoms. Since each O2 has 2 O, I need 25/2 = 12.5 moles of O2.

So the balanced equation is:
C8H18 + 25/2 O2 → 8 CO2 + 9 H2O

To make it cleaner, I can multiply everything by 2 to eliminate the fraction:
2 C8H18 + 25 O2 → 16 CO2 + 18 H2O

Okay, so now I know the mole ratio between octane and oxygen. For every 2 moles of octane, 25 moles of O2 are needed.

But the problem is about volume, and we're working at S.T.P., where 1 mole of gas occupies 22.4 liters. So I can use the molar volumes directly.

Wait, but first, I need to find out how many moles of octane I have. The problem says 4 liters of octane weigh 3.19 kg, which is 3190 grams. So I can find moles using the molar mass of octane.

The molar mass of C8H18 is (8×12.01) + (18×1.008). Let me calculate that:

8×12.01 = 96.08
18×1.008 = 18.144
Total molar mass = 96.08 + 18.144 = 114.224 g/mol

So moles of octane = mass / molar mass = 3190 g / 114.224 g/mol ≈ let's see, 3190 ÷ 114.224. Let me compute that. 114.224 × 27.8 ≈ 3190? Let me check: 114.224 × 27 = 3084, 114.224 ×28=3198. So 27.8 would be around 3190. So approximately 27.8 moles of octane.

Now, from the balanced equation, 2 moles of octane require 25 moles of O2. So per mole of octane, it's 25/2 = 12.5 moles of O2 needed.

So for 27.8 moles of octane, O2 needed is 27.8 × 12.5 = let's calculate that. 27.8 ×12 = 333.6, and 27.8 ×0.5=13.9, so total 333.6+13.9=347.5 moles of O2.

Wait, but wait, that's the moles of O2. But the question is about the volume of air required. Air is a mixture, with about 21% O2, so the rest is other gases like N2, which don't react. So I need to find the volume of air that contains 347.5 moles of O2.

Since air is about 21% O2, the total moles of air needed would be 347.5 / 0.21. Let me compute that: 347.5 ÷ 0.21 ≈ 1654.76 moles of air.

Wait, no, wait. That approach might not be correct. Because when you have a volume of air, each mole of air contains 0.21 moles of O2. So the volume of air required would be the volume that provides 347.5 moles of O2.

Alternatively, since the amount of O2 is 347.5 moles, and each mole of air has 0.21 moles O2, the moles of air needed would be 347.5 / 0.21 ≈ 1654.76 moles of air.

But wait, another approach: the volume of O2 needed is 347.5 moles × 22.4 L/mol = let's see, 347.5 ×22.4 ≈ 7780 liters of O2.

But since O2 is 21% of air, the total air volume would be 7780 L / 0.21 ≈ 37,047.62 liters of air.

Hmm, but that doesn't match any of the options. Let me check my calculations again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial moles of octane. Let me recalculate that.

Given 4 liters of octane is 3.19 kg, so 3190 grams. Molar mass of C8H18 is 114.224 g/mol. So moles = 3190 / 114.224 ≈ let me compute that accurately.

3190 ÷ 114.224: 114.224 × 27 = 3084.048. 3190 - 3084.048 = 105.952. 105.952 ÷ 114.224 ≈ 0.927. So total moles ≈ 27.927 moles.

So that's approximately 27.927 moles of octane.

From the balanced equation, 2 moles of octane require 25 moles O2. So per mole octane, 12.5 moles O2.

So O2 needed = 27.927 ×12.5 ≈ 349.0875 moles O2.

Now, the volume of O2 is 349.0875 ×22.4 ≈ 349.0875 ×22.4 = let's compute that.

349 ×22.4 = 7825.6, 0.0875×22.4=1.96. So total O2 volume ≈ 7825.6 +1.96 ≈7827.56 liters.

Now, since air is about 21% O2, the volume of air needed is 7827.56 / 0.21 = let's compute that.

7827.56 ÷0.21 ≈ 37274 liters.

Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see 37,274 liters. The options are in the range of ~20k to ~65k. Let me check if I messed up the moles of O2.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the balanced equation. Let me recheck the stoichiometry.

The balanced equation is:

2 C8H18 + 25 O2 → 16 CO2 + 18 H2O

So 2 moles of octane require 25 moles of O2. So per mole of octane, it's 25/2 =12.5 moles O2. That part seems correct.

Wait, but perhaps the molar mass of octane is incorrect? Let me double-check.

C is 12.01, H is 1.008.

C8H18: 8×12.01 =96.08, 18×1.008=18.144. Total 114.224 g/mol. Correct.

So moles of octane: 3190 / 114.224 ≈27.927. Correct.

So O2 needed: 27.927 ×12.5 =349.0875 moles.

Volume of O2: 349.0875 ×22.4 = let me compute more accurately.

349.0875 ×22.4:

349 ×22.4 = (300×22.4) + (49×22.4) = 6720 + 1097.6 =7817.6.

0.0875 ×22.4=1.96.

Total O2 volume: 7817.6 +1.96=7819.56 liters.

So O2 is 7819.56 liters.

Since O2 is 21% of air, the total air volume is 7819.56 /0.21 ≈ let's compute that.

7819.56 ÷0.21 = approx 37236 liters.

Hmm, but none of the options are around 37k. The closest option is E:39,175.40 liters, but that's higher. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the air composition. Maybe the question assumes that air is all O2, which isn't correct, but perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the other gases or use a different approach.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem uses the molar ratio of O2 to C8H18, and then converts moles of O2 to liters, and then directly to air. But wait, perhaps the problem expects that 1 mole of air provides 1 mole of O2, which isn't correct, but maybe that's what the problem is assuming. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the moles of O2 needed, then convert that to the volume of O2, and then since O2 is 21% of air, the air volume would be O2 volume divided by 0.21.

Wait, another way: the volume of O2 required is V_O2 = n_O2 ×22.4 =349.0875 ×22.4 ≈7819.56 L.

Then, since air is 21% O2, the volume of air is V_air = V_O2 / 0.21 =7819.56 /0.21 ≈37236 L.

But looking at the options, the closest is E:39,175.40 liters. Hmm, that's about 2k higher. Maybe I made a mistake in the initial moles of octane.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the moles more accurately.

Molar mass of octane: 114.224 g/mol.

Moles =3190 /114.224 = let me compute this precisely.

3190 ÷114.224:

Let me compute 114.224 ×27.8 = ?

114.224 ×27 = 3084.048.

114.224 ×0.8 =91.3792.

So 27.8 ×114.224 =3084.048 +91.3792=3175.4272.

But 3175.4272 is less than 3190. The difference is 3190-3175.4272=14.5728 grams.

So 14.5728 grams is how many moles? 14.5728 /114.224 ≈0.1275 moles.

So total moles ≈27.8 +0.1275≈27.9275 moles. So earlier calculation was correct.

Hmm, maybe the problem expects a different approach. Alternatively, perhaps the balanced equation is different. Let me recheck the balanced equation.

C8H18 + O2 → CO2 + H2O.

Balanced steps:

C:8 →8 CO2.

H:18 →9 H2O.

O on product side:8×2 +9×1=25 O. So O2 needed is 25/2 =12.5 per C8H18.

So yes, 2 C8H18 +25 O2 →16 CO2 +18 H2O.

So moles O2 needed per 2 moles C8H18 is25.

So for 27.9275 moles C8H18, O2 needed is (25/2)*27.9275 ≈349.096 moles.

Hmm, same as before.

Wait, perhaps the question is using molar volume at STP as 24 liters per mole? Because sometimes 24 L/mol is used as an approximation.

If I use 24 L/mol:

O2 volume =349.096 ×24 ≈8378.3 L.

Air volume =8378.3 /0.21 ≈39,944 L.

Hmm, but that's higher than option E (39,175.40). So perhaps the problem uses 22.4 L/mol and 0.21 fraction.

Wait, maybe I should compute more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps the question expects the volume of air in terms of moles of O2, without considering that air is only 21% O2. Wait, but that can't be right because the question is about air, not pure O2.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial step. The problem says 4 liters of octane weigh 3.19 kg. Wait, 4 liters of octane has a mass of 3190 grams. But wait, is the volume of octane 4 liters at STP? Because if it's at STP, the density can be calculated, but perhaps octane is a liquid, so its volume is measured in liters as a liquid, not as a gas. Hmm, that might complicate things. Because if it's a liquid, its volume is 4 liters, but the mass is 3.19 kg. So perhaps I should proceed as I did before, because the moles are based on mass, not volume as gas.

Wait, but in the combustion reaction, we're dealing with gaseous reactants and products, so perhaps the 4 liters of octane is given as a liquid, so the volume doesn't directly translate to moles; we have to use the mass.

So perhaps my initial approach is correct.

Wait, let me try to compute the exact value again.

Molar mass of octane: 114.224 g/mol.

Moles =3190 /114.224 = let me calculate this precisely.

3190 ÷114.224.

Let me compute 114.224 ×27 =3084.048.

3190 - 3084.048 =105.952.

Now, 105.952 ÷114.224 = approximately 0.927.

So total moles ≈27.927.

O2 needed:27.927 ×12.5=349.0875 moles.

O2 volume:349.0875 ×22.4 =7819.56 liters.

Air volume:7819.56 /0.21=37236 liters.

But none of the options are close to that. Wait, let me check the options again.

Options:

A:22,102.28

B:58,650.00

C:49,350.25

D:65,292.15

E:39,175.40

F:26,116.93

G:44,204.56

H:19,587.70

I:17,481.92

J:31,900.00

Hmm, I'm getting around 37,236 liters, which isn't an option. The closest is E:39,175.40, which is a bit higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the moles of O2. Let me double-check the stoichiometry.

In the balanced equation, 2 C8H18 +25 O2 →16 CO2 +18 H2O.

So for 2 moles of octane, 25 moles O2. So per mole octane, 25/2=12.5 moles O2.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the molar volume as 24 L/mol instead of 22.4. Let's try that.

O2 volume =349.0875 ×24=8378.1 liters.

Air volume =8378.1 /0.21=39943.33 liters.

Still not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses 22.4 L per mole but doesn't account for the air's 21% O2, which would be incorrect but perhaps that's what the options are based on.

Wait, if I just consider the volume of O2 and not the air's composition, then O2 volume is 7819.56 liters. But that's not an option either.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the volume of O2, but no, the question says air.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation of moles of octane. Let me recheck that.

3190 grams divided by 114.224 g/mol.

Let me compute 3190 ÷114.224.

Using a calculator approach:

114.224 ×27 =3084.048.

3190 -3084.048=105.952.

Now, 105.952 ÷114.224 = approx 0.927.

So total moles ≈27.927.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Let me compute 3190 ÷114.224.

Let me do this division step by step.

114.224 ×27 =3084.048.

Subtract from 3190: 3190 -3084.048=105.952.

Now, 105.952 ÷114.224.

Let me write this as 105952 ÷114224.

Approximately, 114224 ×0.927=105,952 (since 114224 ×0.9=102,801.6; 0.02×114224=2284.48; 0.007×114224=800. So total 102,801.6+2284.48=105,086.08 +800=105,886.08. Close to 105,952.

So 0.927 +0.0006 (approx) would get to 105,952.

So moles ≈27.9276.

So O2 moles=27.9276 ×12.5=349.095 moles.

O2 volume=349.095 ×22.4=7819.504 liters.

Air volume=7819.504 /0.21=37235.73 liters.

Hmm, not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps the problem assumes that the volume of air is based on the molar volume of O2, but not accounting for the 21% efficiency. Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the volume of O2 required and treats air as if it's 100% O2, which would be wrong, but let's see.

If I ignore the 21% and just take O2 volume as the air volume, then 7819.5 liters, but that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects to use the molar ratio without considering the O2 in air, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the stoichiometry. Let me check the balanced equation again.

C8H18 + O2 → CO2 + H2O.

Let me balance it step by step.

Carbon: 8 →8 CO2.

Hydrogen:18 →9 H2O.

Oxygen on product side:8×2 +9×1=25.

So O2 needed:25/2 =12.5 per C8H18.

So balanced equation: C8H18 + 12.5 O2 →8 CO2 +9 H2O.

So for 1 mole of C8H18, 12.5 moles O2.

So for 27.927 moles, 27.927 ×12.5=349.0875 moles O2.

Hmm, same as before.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the air to be in terms of the molar volume at STP, but without considering the O2 percentage. That would be incorrect, but perhaps that's what the options are based on.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the molar volume as 22.4 L per mole, and then simply multiplying the moles of O2 by (22.4 L/mol) and then by (1/0.21) to get air volume.

Wait, but that's what I did earlier, and it didn't match.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the exact value again.

n_O2 =27.927 ×12.5=349.0875 moles.

V_O2 =349.0875 ×22.4 = let's compute it precisely.

349 ×22.4 = let's compute 300×22.4=6720, 49×22.4=1097.6, so total 6720+1097.6=7817.6.

0.0875×22.4=1.96.

So V_O2=7817.6 +1.96=7819.56 L.

Air volume=7819.56 /0.21=37236 L.

Hmm, but none of the options match. Wait, perhaps the problem uses a different approach, such as considering the volume of octane in liters and then converting to moles using density, but I think I did that correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the volume of air in terms of the moles of O2 without considering the 21% O2 in air, which would be wrong, but let's see:

If I take O2 volume as 7819.56 L, and treat that as the air volume, which would be wrong, but looking at the options, J is 31,900 L, which is roughly 31,900. That's less than what I got. Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different molar mass or different stoichiometry.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the molar mass of octane. Let me check again.

C:12.01 ×8=96.08.

H:1.008 ×18=18.144.

Total=114.224 g/mol. Correct.

Hmm, I'm stuck. The calculation leads me to approximately 37,236 liters, which isn't among the options. Maybe I should check if I made a mistake in the initial step.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is using the molar volume of air at STP, considering the entire air, but perhaps using the molar volume for O2 and then scaling. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the molar ratio of O2 to C8H18 and then converting to the volume of O2, and then treating that as the volume of air, which would be incorrect but perhaps that's what the options are based on.

If I just take O2 volume as 7819.56 L and that's the air volume, then it's about 7819.56 L, which isn't an option. The closest is J:31,900 L, but that's not close.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different molar ratio. Let me think: sometimes, in some textbooks, the combustion reaction is written with an extra O2 coefficient. Let me see if I balanced correctly.

Wait, another way to write the balanced equation is:

C8H18 + 25/2 O2 →8 CO2 +9 H2O.

Alternatively, sometimes people write it as:

2 C8H18 +25 O2 →16 CO2 +18 H2O.

Which is what I did. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the volume of O2 in terms of the reaction stoichiometry, but without considering the percentage of O2 in air. So perhaps the answer is the volume of O2, which is 7819.56 L, but that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a molar volume of 22.4 L for O2, and then treating the air as 22.4 L per mole, but that wouldn't make sense because air is a mixture.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the options and see which one is closest to my calculation. I got 37,236 L, which is not an option, but option E is 39,175.40 L, which is about 2% higher. Maybe I should check if I made a calculation error in O2 volume.

Wait, 349.0875 moles ×22.4 L/mol = ?

349.0875 ×22.4:

Let me compute 349 ×22.4 = 7817.6.

0.0875 ×22.4 =1.96.

Total 7817.6 +1.96=7819.56 L.

Yes, that's correct.

So air volume=7819.56 /0.21=37236 L.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the air volume to be based on the molar ratio without considering the O2 percentage. So perhaps the answer is 349.0875 ×22.4=7819.56 L, but that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the molar ratio and then using the molar volume of air as 22.4 L/mol, but that's not correct because air is a mixture.

Wait, perhaps I should think differently. Maybe the problem is asking for the volume of air in terms of the moles of O2, but considering that each mole of air provides one mole of O2, which is incorrect but perhaps that's what the problem expects.

If that's the case, then moles of O2 needed=349.0875, so volume of air would be 349.0875 ×22.4=7819.56 L, but again, not an option.

Hmm, I'm confused. Maybe I should look for another approach. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the molar mass of octane as 114 g/mol, which would change the moles calculation slightly.

If molar mass is 114 g/mol, then moles=3190 /114≈27.9825 moles.

Then O2 needed=27.9825 ×12.5=349.78125 moles.

Volume O2=349.78125 ×22.4=7850.75 L.

Air volume=7850.75 /0.21≈37384.5 L.

Still not matching any option.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the volume of air to be in terms of the molar volume at STP, but without considering the O2 percentage. So perhaps the answer is 349.0875 ×22.4=7819.56 L, but that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial step and the moles of octane are different.

Wait, 4 liters of octane is 3.19 kg. So if octane is a liquid, its density is mass/volume. So density=3190 g/4000 mL=0.7975 g/mL. Wait, but that's probably not needed because we used the mass to find moles.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for an alternative approach. Wait, perhaps the problem is using the molar ratio and then converting moles of O2 to liters, but perhaps it's not considering the 0.21 factor, which would give 7819.56 liters, but that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the molar ratio and then multiplying by 22.4, giving 349.0875 ×22.4=7819.56 L, but that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps I should check the options again. Option E is 39,175.40 liters. Let me see what moles of O2 that would imply.

If air volume is 39,175.40 L, then O2 volume=39,175.40 ×0.21=8226.834 L.

Moles of O2=8226.834 /22.4≈367.07 moles.

Then, moles of octane= (367.07 ×2)/25= (734.14)/25≈29.3656 moles.

Then, mass of octane=29.3656 ×114.224≈3354 grams, which is 3.354 kg, but the problem states 3.19 kg. So that's not matching.

Hmm, perhaps the problem expects a different approach. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the volume of air is based on the molar volume of O2, without considering the 21% factor, which would be wrong but perhaps that's what the options are based on.

If I take O2 volume as 7819.56 L, and treat that as the air volume, then it's about 7820 L, which isn't an option. The closest is J:31,900 L, but that's much higher.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different molar ratio. Let me think: perhaps the balanced equation is different. For example, sometimes people write the combustion reaction as:

C8H18 + 12.5 O2 →8 CO2 +9 H2O.

Which is the same as I did. So that's correct.

I'm stuck. I think I've done the calculations correctly, but none of the options match. Maybe I made a mistake in the initial step. Let me check the molar mass again.

C:12.01 ×8=96.08.

H:1.008 ×18=18.144.

Total=114.224 g/mol. Correct.

Moles=3190/114.224≈27.927. Correct.

O2 needed=27.927 ×12.5=349.0875. Correct.

Volume O2=349.0875 ×22.4=7819.56 L. Correct.

Air volume=7819.56 /0.21≈37,236 L.

But none of the options are close. Wait, perhaps the problem is using the molar volume as 24 L/mol, which would give:

O2 volume=349.0875 ×24=8378.1 L.

Air volume=8378.1 /0.21≈39,943 L.

Which is close to option E:39,175.40. Maybe the problem used 24 L/mol and rounded differently.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer to be option E:39,175.40 liters.

To calculate the volume of air required for the complete combustion of 4 liters of octane gasoline at S.T.P., we start by determining the moles of octane. The mass of octane is 3.19 kg (3190 g), and its molar mass is calculated as:

\[
\text{Molar mass of } \text{C}_8\text{H}_{18} = (8 \times 12.01) + (18 \times 1.008) = 114.224 \, \text{g/mol}.
\]

The moles of octane are:

\[
\text{Moles of octane} = \frac{3190 \, \text{g}}{114.224 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 27.927 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The balanced combustion reaction for octane is:

\[
2 \, \text{C}_8\text{H}_{18} + 25 \, \text{O}_2 \rightarrow 16 \, \text{CO}_2 + 18 \, \text{H}_2\text{O}.
\]

From the balanced equation, 2 moles of octane require 25 moles of oxygen. Therefore, the moles of oxygen needed for 27.927 moles of octane are:

\[
\text{Moles of O}_2 = 27.927 \times \frac{25}{2} = 349.0875 \, \text{mol}.
\]

At S.T.P., 1 mole of gas occupies 22.4 liters. The volume of oxygen required is:

\[
\text{Volume of O}_2 = 349.0875 \, \text{mol} \times 22.4 \, \text{L/mol} \approx 7819.56 \, \text{L}.
\]

Since air is approximately 21% oxygen, the total volume of air required is:

\[
\text{Volume of air} = \frac{7819.56 \, \text{L}}{0.21} \approx 37236 \, \text{L}.
\]

However, this value does not match any of the provided options. Recalculating using a molar volume of 24 L/mol (a common approximation) for oxygen gives:

\[
\text{Volume of O}_2 = 349.0875 \, \text{mol} \times 24 \, \text{L/mol} \approx 8378.1 \, \text{L}.
\]

The total volume of air required is then:

\[
\text{Volume of air} = \frac{8378.1 \, \text{L}}{0.21} \approx 39943 \, \text{L}.
\]

This is close to option E: 39,175.40 liters. Given the approximations and potential rounding in the problem, the closest match is:
