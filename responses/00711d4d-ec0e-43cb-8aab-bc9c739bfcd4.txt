<think>
Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm supposed to find the final concentration of I^- ions after mixing two solutions. Let me try to break this down step by step because I'm a bit rusty on these kinds of problems.

First, the problem says we're mixing 35.0 ml of 0.100 M NaHSO₃ with 10.0 ml of 0.100 M KIO₃. The volumes are additive, which is good because I don't have to worry about any volume changes beyond just adding them together. 

Hmm, I remember that when you mix solutions, the total concentration of each ion depends on the moles of that ion in each solution divided by the total volume after mixing.

Let me think about each solution separately. 

Starting with NaHSO₃. Sodium bisulfite, right? NaHSO3 dissociates in water. I think it dissociates into Na+ and HSO3^- ions. So, each mole of NaHSO3 gives one mole of HSO3^-.

Wait, but HSO3^- is a weak acid, so does it dissociate further? HSO3^- can act as an acid, donating a proton to become SO3^2- and H3O+. But in this case, since we're dealing with NaHSO3, maybe it's just the initial dissociation that matters for the concentration, not the further ionization. Or does the problem consider the HSO3^- to fully dissociate? No, wait, actually, NaHSO3 is a salt that dissociates completely into Na+ and HSO3^- ions. The HSO3^- is the conjugate base of H2SO3 (sulfurous acid), but for the purpose of calculating concentrations, I think we just take the initial dissociation. So the concentration of HSO3^- from NaHSO3 is the same as the concentration of NaHSO3 solution.

So the moles of HSO3^- from the NaHSO3 solution can be calculated. The volume is 35.0 mL, which is 0.035 L. Molarity is moles per liter, so moles = Molarity × Volume. So 0.100 M × 0.035 L = 0.0035 moles of HSO3^-.

Now, the other solution is KIO3. KIO3 is potassium iodate, which dissociates into K+ and IO3^- ions. Each mole of KIO3 gives one mole of IO3^-.

IO3^- is a pretty strong oxidizing agent, I remember that. It can oxidize I^- ions, but wait, in this case, we're not adding I^- yet. Oh wait, maybe the question is about the reaction between HSO3^- and IO3^-? Because if we mix these two, perhaps they react. Oh wait, that's probably the key here.

Wait, because the problem is about the concentration of I^-, but neither solution initially has I^-. So maybe I'm missing something. Let me read the problem again.

Wait a second, the problem says "the final concentration of I^- in a solution." But neither NaHSO3 nor KIO3 contain I^- ions. Hmm, that's confusing. Oh wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again.

Wait, KIO3 is K+ and IO3^- (iodate). So IO3^- is the iodate ion. But the problem is about I^-, the iodide ion. So where does I^- come into play? Oh, wait a minute, perhaps there's a redox reaction happening here between HSO3^- and IO3^-.

Wait, perhaps when we mix NaHSO3 and KIO3, they react. I think HSO3^- can act as a reducing agent. I remember that in acidic conditions, IO3^- can oxidize I^- to I2, but wait, that's when I^- is present. But in this case, perhaps HSO3^- is being oxidized by IO3^-?

Wait, no, wait. Let me think more carefully. HSO3^- is a weak acid, but it can also act as a reducing agent. IO3^- is a strong oxidizing agent in acidic conditions. So when H+ is present, the reaction between HSO3^- and IO3^- can occur. 

So maybe the reaction is something like this:

HSO3^- + IO3^- → I^- + SO4^2- 

But wait, I'm not sure about the products. Let me think about the possible redox reactions.

HSO3^- can be oxidized. Let's look at the possible oxidation states. S in HSO3^- is +4 oxidation state. It can be oxidized to +6 (in SO4^2-). 

IO3^- has I in +5 oxidation state. It can be reduced to I^- (which is -1). So the reaction would involve HSO3^- being oxidized and IO3^- being reduced.

So the half-reactions would be:

Oxidation (HSO3^- → SO4^2- ):
HSO3^- → SO4^2-
We need to balance this. Let's see, in acidic solution.

HSO3^- → SO4^2-
Add H2O and H+ as needed.

HSO3^- → SO4^2-
Add H2O to the right: HSO3^- → SO4^2- + H2O
Wait, that doesn't make sense. Let me try again.

HSO3^- → SO4^2-
We can balance S first: 1 each.

O: HSO3^- has 3 O, SO4^2- has 4 O. So need to add H2O on the left or right. Let's add H2O to the right.

HSO3^- → SO4^2- + H2O
Now O is balanced: 3 O on left, 4 + 2 (from H2O) = 6 O on right. Wait, that's 6 O on right, but left is 3. Hmm, perhaps I need to add H2O to the left.

Wait, maybe better to approach it step by step.

Step 1: HSO3^- → SO4^2-
Add H2O to the right to balance O:
HSO3^- → SO4^2- + H2O
Now O: 3 on left, 4 + 2 =6 on right. So not balanced. So I'll need to add H2O to the left.

HSO3^- + H2O → SO4^2- + H2O? No, that doesn't help. Alternatively, maybe add H2O to the right and balance O.

Wait, perhaps it's better to write it as:

HSO3^- → SO4^2-
We can add H2O to the right and H+ to the left.

HSO3^- → SO4^2- + H2O
Wait, that gives O as 3 on left and 4 (from SO4) + 2 (from H2O) =6 O on right. Not balanced.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct way is:

HSO3^- → SO4^2-
The S goes from +4 to +6, so oxidation, losing 2 electrons.

So the oxidation half-reaction would be:

HSO3^- → SO4^2- + 2e^-

Wait, but let me balance O and H first.

HSO3^- → SO4^2-
Add H2O to the right: HSO3^- → SO4^2- + H2O
Now O is 3 on left, 4 + 2 =6 on right. So I need to add H2O to the left to balance O.

Wait, maybe that's not the right approach. Let me try:

HSO3^- → SO4^2-
Add H2O to the right and H+ to the left to balance O and H.

HSO3^- → SO4^2- + H2O
Now O: 3 on left, 4 (SO4) + 2 (H2O) =6 on right. To balance O, add H2O to the left.

HSO3^- + H2O → SO4^2- + H2O
Wait, that still doesn't help. Maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me use a different approach. Let's write the oxidation half-reaction.

HSO3^- → SO4^2-
S: +4 → +6 → oxidation, so 2 electrons lost.

Now, balance O by adding H2O. Since HSO3^- has 3 O, SO4^2- has 4 O. So we add H2O to the left to make O equal.

HSO3^- + H2O → SO4^2-
Now O: 3 + 2 =5 O on left, 4 on right. Wait, that's not matching. Hmm, perhaps a better approach is to add H2O to the right.

HSO3^- → SO4^2- + H2O
O: 3 on left, 4 + 2 =6 on right. So, 3 →6, so we need to add 3 H2O on the left.

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think about the steps again.

The correct way to balance HSO3^- to SO4^2-:

HSO3^- → SO4^2-
Add H2O to the right to balance O:

HSO3^- → SO4^2- + H2O
Now O: 3 on left, 4 + 2 =6 on right. So 3 →6, need to add H2O to left.

Wait, perhaps better to write:

HSO3^- → SO4^2-
Add H2O to the right:

HSO3^- → SO4^2- + H2O
Now O: 3 →4+2=6 → need 3 more O on left, so add 3 H2O to the left.

3 H2O + HSO3^- → SO4^2- + H2O
Now O on left: 3×H2O (3×O) + HSO3^- (3 O) → total 6 O.

On right: SO4^2- (4 O) + H2O (2 O) → total 6 O. O balanced.

Now balance H. On left: 3×H2O → 6 H. On right: H2O → 2 H. So we have 6 H on left, 2 on right. To balance, add 4 H+ to the right.

3 H2O + HSO3^- → SO4^2- + H2O +4 H+
Now H: left 6, right 2 +4 =6. Balanced.

Now charge balance. Left side: HSO3^- has charge -1. Right side: SO4^2- (-2) + H2O (neutral) +4 H+ (+4) → total charge is (-2) +4 = +2.

Left side: -1, right: +2. So the difference is -1 to +2 → a change of +3. So need to add 3 electrons to the right side to balance charge.

So the oxidation half-reaction becomes:

3 H2O + HSO3^- → SO4^2- + H2O +4 H+ + 3 e^-
Simplify by subtracting H2O:

3 H2O → H2O → 2 H2O on left.

So:

2 H2O + HSO3^- → SO4^2- +4 H+ +3 e^-

Now, the reduction half-reaction. IO3^- is being reduced. I is in +5 oxidation state; it goes to -1 in I^-. So each IO3^- gains 6 electrons.

The reduction half-reaction for IO3^- to I^- in acidic solution is:

IO3^- + 6 H+ + 5 e^- → I^- + 3 H2O

Now, to balance the electrons, we'll need to multiply the oxidation half-reaction by 5 and the reduction by 3 so that the electrons cancel out.

Oxidation ×5:

10 H2O +5 HSO3^- →5 SO4^2- +20 H+ +15 e^-

Reduction ×3:

3 IO3^- + 18 H+ +15 e^- →3 I^- +9 H2O

Now, add them together:

10 H2O +5 HSO3^- +3 IO3^- +18 H+ →5 SO4^2- +20 H+ +3 I^- +9 H2O

Simplify by combining like terms:

H2O: 10 -9 =1 H2O on left.

H+ :18 on left, 20 on right → net 2 H+ on right.

So:

1 H2O +5 HSO3^- +3 IO3^- →5 SO4^2- +2 H+ +3 I^-

Now, let's write the balanced equation without the H+ and H2O for ions:

But perhaps it's better to write the overall reaction as:

5 HSO3^- +3 IO3^- →5 SO4^2- +3 I^- + other stuff.

Wait, but let me check the H and O again, maybe I made a mistake in the combination.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write the overall equation as:

5 HSO3^- +3 IO3^- + H+ →5 SO4^2- +3 I^- + H2O

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the balancing. Let me go through the combined equation again.

From oxidation ×5:

10 H2O +5 HSO3^- →5 SO4^2- +20 H+ +15 e^-

Reduction ×3:

3 IO3^- +18 H+ +15 e^- →3 I^- +9 H2O

Adding them:

10 H2O +5 HSO3^- +3 IO3^- +18 H+ →5 SO4^2- +20 H+ +3 I^- +9 H2O

Combine H2O: 10 H2O -9 H2O =1 H2O on left.

H+: 18 on left, 20 on right → 2 H+ on right.

So equation becomes:

1 H2O +5 HSO3^- +3 IO3^- +18 H+ →5 SO4^2- +2 H+ +3 I^- +9 H2O

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Maybe I made a mistake in the H+ count.

Wait, in the oxidation half-reaction, after ×5, there are 20 H+ on the right.

In the reduction ×3, there are 18 H+ on the left.

So when adding, H+ on left:18, on right:20. So net H+ on right: 20-18=2 H+ on right.

H2O: 10 on left, 9 on right → 1 H2O left.

So the equation becomes:

1 H2O +5 HSO3^- +3 IO3^- →5 SO4^2- +3 I^- +2 H+

Wait, but that's not balanced for H. Let me see:

Left side H: H2O (2 H) +5 HSO3^- (each has 1 H →5 H) → total 7 H.

Right side:5 SO4^2- (no H), 3 I^- (no H), 2 H+ →2 H.

So 7 H on left, 2 on right. That's not balanced. Hmm, maybe I made an error in the earlier steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the overall balanced equation is:

5 HSO3^- +3 IO3^- →5 SO4^2- +3 I^- + other ions.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let me look up the standard reaction between HSO3^- and IO3^-.

Wait, but since I can't look things up, I'll have to proceed carefully.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the mole ratio from the balanced equation. From the half-reactions, the stoichiometric ratio is 5 HSO3^- reacting with 3 IO3^-.

So, for every 5 moles of HSO3^- consumed, 3 moles of IO3^- are consumed, and 3 moles of I^- are produced.

Now, going back to the problem. We have 0.0035 moles of HSO3^- from NaHSO3 (35 mL × 0.1 M = 0.0035 mol), and 0.010 L ×0.1 M = 0.001 mol of IO3^- from KIO3.

So, let's see the mole ratio. The reaction requires 5 moles of HSO3^- for every 3 moles of IO3^-.

So, the moles of HSO3^- available: 0.0035 mol.

Moles of IO3^- available: 0.001 mol.

We can calculate which is the limiting reactant.

The required ratio is 5 HSO3^- : 3 IO3^-.

So, for the available moles, let's see:

HSO3^- available: 0.0035 mol.

IO3^- available: 0.001 mol.

The ratio of available HSO3^- to IO3^- is 0.0035 : 0.001 = 3.5 :1.

The required ratio is 5:3 → approximately 1.666 :1.

Since 3.5 >1.666, HSO3^- is in excess, and IO3^- is the limiting reactant.

So, all the IO3^- (0.001 mol) will react, and the amount of HSO3^- consumed will be (5/3) × 0.001 = 0.001666... mol.

But wait, we have 0.0035 mol HSO3^- available. So 0.001666... mol will be consumed, leaving 0.0035 - 0.001666 = 0.001833... mol of HSO3^- unreacted.

The reaction produces 3 moles of I^- for every 3 moles of IO3^- reacted. So 0.001 mol IO3^- × (3 I^- /3 IO3^-) = 0.001 mol I^- produced.

Wait, no, the ratio is 3 I^- per 3 IO3^- → 1:1.

Wait, in the balanced equation, for every 3 IO3^- consumed, 3 I^- are produced. So 1:1 ratio.

So 0.001 mol IO3^- → 0.001 mol I^-.

So the total I^- in solution is 0.001 mol.

Wait, but wait. The total volume after mixing is 35 mL +10 mL =45 mL =0.045 L.

So the concentration of I^- would be moles/volume = 0.001 mol / 0.045 L ≈0.02222 M.

Wait, but looking at the options, none of them are 0.02222 M. Let me check the options again.

Wait, the options are given in terms of moles, not molarity. Wait, no, looking back, the options are labeled as "concentration of I^-," but the units are in moles. Wait, no, the options are in moles, but that's confusing because concentration is molarity (mol/L), but the options are written as "6.0 ×10^-4 moles," etc. That can't be right. Wait, perhaps the options are in molarity, but the way they're written is a bit ambiguous.

Wait, the question says "the final concentration of I^- in a solution" and the options are A to J with values like 6.0 ×10^-4 moles. Wait, that can't be concentration because concentration is in mol/L. So perhaps the options are in mol/L, but written as "moles," which is a bit confusing. Alternatively, maybe the options are in moles present in the solution, not concentration. Let me re-examine the question.

The question says, "What will be the final concentration of I^-..." and the options are presented as "moles" with exponents. Wait, no, that can't be. Because concentration is in mol/L, and the options are in moles, which would be total moles, not concentration. So perhaps the options are in mol/L, but written as "moles × 10^-something," which is a bit ambiguous. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misinterpreting. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options:

A: 6.0 × 10^-4 moles

B: 1.0 ×10^-3 moles

C: 1.5 ×10^-3 moles

D: 3.0 × 10^-3 moles

E: 7.0 ×10^-4 moles

F: 2.5 ×10^-3 moles

G: 8.0 ×10^-4 moles

H: 2.0 ×10^-3 moles

I: 5.0 ×10^-4 moles

J: 1.2 × 10^-3 moles

Wait, these are all in moles, but since the solutions are mixed into a total volume, the concentration would be moles divided by volume in liters. But the options are given as moles, which would be the total moles of I^- in the solution, not the concentration.

Wait, that makes more sense. The question asks for the final concentration, but the options are in moles, which suggests that perhaps the question is asking for the total moles of I^- in the solution, not the concentration (mol/L). Alternatively, perhaps the question has a typo, and the options are in mol/L. Let me read the question again.

The question says, "What will be the final concentration of I^-..." and the options are given as "moles." Hmm, that's conflicting. Because concentration is in mol/L, but the options are in moles, which is a count, not concentration. So perhaps the question is actually asking for the total moles of I^- present after mixing, not the concentration. Let me check.

If that's the case, then the answer would be 0.001 mol, which is 1.0 ×10^-3 mol. Looking at the options, that's option B: 1.0 ×10^-3 moles. So the final answer would be B.

Wait, but let me confirm. The problem says "final concentration of I^-," which should be in mol/L. But the options are in moles, which implies total moles. So perhaps the question is misworded, and it's asking for the total moles, not concentration. 

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the stoichiometry. Let me double-check.

We have 0.0035 mol HSO3^- and 0.001 mol IO3^-.

The reaction is 5 HSO3^- +3 IO3^- → products.

So the mole ratio is 5:3.

Available HSO3^-: 0.0035, which is 3.5 mmol.

Available IO3^-: 0.001, which is 1 mmol.

The limiting reagent is IO3^- because 1 mmol IO3^- requires (5/3) mmol HSO3^-, which is about 1.666 mmol. We have 3.5 mmol HSO3^-, which is more than enough. So IO3^- is limiting.

So moles of I^- produced: 3 mmol I^- per 3 mmol IO3^- → 1:1 ratio. So 1 mmol of IO3^- produces 1 mmol of I^-.

So total I^- is 0.001 mol, which is 1.0 ×10^-3 mol.

So the answer would be option B: 1.0 ×10^-3 moles.
</think>

To determine the final concentration of I⁻ in the solution, we analyze the reaction between HSO₃⁻ (from NaHSO₃) and IO₃⁻ (from KIO₃). The reaction is a redox process where HSO₃⁻ is oxidized to SO₄²⁻, and IO₃⁻ is reduced to I⁻. The balanced reaction is:

\[
5 \, \text{HSO}_3^- + 3 \, \text{IO}_3^- \rightarrow 5 \, \text{SO}_4^{2-} + 3 \, \text{I}^-
\]

### Step 1: Calculate moles of each reactant
- **HSO₃⁻ (from NaHSO₃):**  
  Volume = 35.0 mL = 0.035 L, Molarity = 0.100 M  
  Moles = \( 0.100 \, \text{M} \times 0.035 \, \text{L} = 0.0035 \, \text{mol} \)

- **IO₃⁻ (from KIO₃):**  
  Volume = 10.0 mL = 0.010 L, Molarity = 0.100 M  
  Moles = \( 0.100 \, \text{M} \times 0.010 \, \text{L} = 0.001 \, \text{mol} \)

### Step 2: Identify the limiting reactant
From the balanced equation, the stoichiometric ratio is \( 5 \, \text{HSO}_3^- : 3 \, \text{IO}_3^- \).  
- Required moles of HSO₃⁻ for 0.001 mol IO₃⁻:  
  \( \frac{5}{3} \times 0.001 = 0.00167 \, \text{mol} \)  
- Available HSO₃⁻ = 0.0035 mol, which is more than enough.  

Thus, **IO₃⁻ is the limiting reactant**.

### Step 3: Calculate moles of I⁻ produced
From the balanced equation, 3 moles of IO₃⁻ produce 3 moles of I⁻ (1:1 ratio).  
- Moles of I⁻ produced = \( 0.001 \, \text{mol} \).

### Step 4: Determine the final concentration of I⁻
The total volume of the solution is:  
\[
35.0 \, \text{mL} + 10.0 \, \text{mL} = 45.0 \, \text{mL} = 0.045 \, \text{L}
\]

Concentration of I⁻:  
\[
\text{Concentration} = \frac{\text{Moles of I}^-}{\text{Volume in L}} = \frac{0.001}{0.045} \approx 0.0222 \, \text{M}
\]

However, the question asks for the total moles of I⁻, not the concentration. Therefore, the total moles of I⁻ in the solution is **0.001 mol**, which corresponds to **1.0 × 10⁻³ moles**.

**Final Answer:**  
B: 1.0 × 10⁻³ moles

B
