Question:

Let a undirected graph G with edges E = {<0,2>, <2,4>, <3,4>, <1,4>}, which <A,B> represent Node A is connected to Node B. What is the minimum vertex cover of G if 0 is one of vertex cover? Represent the vertex cover in a list of ascending order.

A: [0, 1, 2]
B: [0, 2, 4]
C: [0, 1, 4]
D: [0, 4]
E: [0, 3, 4]
F: [0, 1, 3]
G: [0, 1]
H: [0, 2, 3]
I: [0, 2]
J: [0, 3]

Okay, so I have this problem about finding the minimum vertex cover in an undirected graph G. The edges given are E = {<0,2>, <2,4>, <3,4>, <1,4>}. I need to find the vertex cover that includes node 0 and is the smallest possible. The options are A through J, and I have to choose the correct one.

First, I remember that a vertex cover is a set of vertices such that every edge in the graph is incident to at least one vertex in the set. The minimum vertex cover is the smallest such set.

Since the problem states that 0 must be part of the vertex cover, I'll start by including 0. Now, I need to see which other nodes are necessary to cover all the edges.

Let me list out the edges again:
- Edge between 0 and 2
- Edge between 2 and 4
- Edge between 3 and 4
- Edge between 1 and 4

Now, since 0 is in the vertex cover, the edge <0,2> is already covered. But the other edges connected to 2, 3, 1, and 4 need to be covered.

Looking at the edge <2,4>, since 2 is connected to 4, and 0 is already covering 2's edge with 0, but 2 is connected to 4 as well. Wait, no, if 0 is in the cover, the edge <0,2> is covered, but the edge <2,4> is not yet covered because neither 2 nor 4 is in the cover. So I need to cover this edge. Similarly, the edge <3,4> and <1,4> need to be covered.

So after including 0, I need to choose the minimal set of other nodes such that all edges are covered.

Let me consider each edge:

- <0,2> is covered by 0.
- <2,4>: Either 2 or 4 must be in the cover.
- <3,4>: Either 3 or 4 must be in the cover.
- <1,4>: Either 1 or 4 must be in the cover.

If I choose 4, that would cover edges <2,4>, <3,4>, and <1,4> all at once. So including 4 would cover three edges with just one node. That seems efficient.

So the current set is {0,4}. Let's check if this covers all edges.

- <0,2>: 0 is in the set, covered.
- <2,4>: 4 is in the set, covered.
- <3,4>: 4 is in the set, covered.
- <1,4>: 4 is in the set, covered.

Yes, that works! So {0,4} is a vertex cover. Now, I need to check if this is indeed the minimum possible. Is there a way to cover all edges with just two nodes, including 0?

Yes, because the set {0,4} has size 2. Let's see if any option matches this. Looking at the options:

Option D is [0,4], which is exactly what I have. So the minimum vertex cover is [0,4], which is option D.

Wait, but let me double-check. Are there any edges not covered? Let me go through each edge again:

- <0,2>: Covered by 0.
- <2,4>: Covered by 4.
- <3,4>: Covered by 4.
- <1,4>: Covered by 4.

Yes, all edges are covered. So the answer should be option D.

The minimum vertex cover includes 0 and 4, covering all edges. 

Answer: D
