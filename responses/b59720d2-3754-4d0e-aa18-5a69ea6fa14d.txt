Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the question is about determining the order of growth of the function T(n) defined recursively. The definition given is T(1) = 7, and for n ≥ 1, T(n + 1) = 3n + T(n). We need to figure out which asymptotic notation (like Θ) correctly describes how T(n) grows with n.

First, I remember that when dealing with recursive functions, especially ones defined with a recurrence relation, it's often helpful to find a closed-form expression or at least understand the pattern of growth. So, let me try to expand the recursion to see if I can find a pattern.

Starting with T(1) = 7. Then, T(2) = 3*1 + T(1) = 3 +7 =10. Next, T(3) = 3*2 + T(2) =6 +10=16. Then T(4)=3*3+T(3)=9+16=25. Hmm, wait a second, 7,10,16,25... those numbers look familiar. 7, then 10, which is 7+3, then 16 which is 10+6, then 25 which is 16+9. Oh right, so each time we're adding 3n, where n is the previous step's index.

Wait, let me think again. Because T(n+1) = 3n + T(n). So, expanding this:

T(n) = T(n-1) +3(n-1)
T(n-1) = T(n-2) +3(n-2)
...
Continuing this way, when we expand all the way down, we get T(n) = T(1) + 3*1 + 3*2 + 3*3 + ... + 3*(n-1).

Since T(1)=7, this becomes T(n) =7 + 3*(1+2+3+...+(n-1)).

Now, the sum of the first (n-1) integers is a well-known formula: sum = (n-1)*n / 2. So substituting that in:

T(n) =7 +3*(n(n-1)/2) =7 + (3n(n-1))/2.

Simplify that: 3n² -3n over 2, plus 7. So, T(n) = (3n² -3n +14)/2. I think that's correct because when I plug in n=1, (3*1 -3*1 +14)/2 = (14)/2=7, which matches T(1)=7. For n=2, (3*4 -6 +14)/2=(12-6+14)/2=20/2=10, which matches T(2)=10. So the formula seems right.

Now, to find the order of growth, we look at the dominant term as n grows large. The expression is (3n² -3n +14)/2. The dominant term is 3n²/2, so T(n) is approximately (3/2)n² for large n.

In terms of asymptotic notation, the Θ notation considers the growth rate, ignoring constants. So, the leading term is n², meaning T(n) grows quadratically. Therefore, the order of growth is Θ(n²).

Looking at the options, let's check the choices. Option J is Θ(n²), which matches our conclusion. Other options like Θ(n log n) (option D) or Θ(n^3) (F) are not correct because our leading term is n squared, not higher.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem is about the order of growth, so it's about the big Theta, which captures the tight bound. Since the leading term is n², any lower-order terms like n or constants become negligible as n increases. So yes, Θ(n²) is correct.

The function T(n) is defined recursively, and expanding the recurrence relation reveals that T(n) grows quadratically. The dominant term in its closed-form expression is n², leading to an order of growth of Θ(n²).

Answer: J
