Question:

Options:

A: 1500
B: 1800
C: 2000
D: 2100
E: 2200
F: 2250
G: 1667
H: 2300
I: 2400
J: 1900

Okay, so I need to figure out the straight-line depreciation for the first year of the tractor. Let's see what I remember about straight-line depreciation. It's a method where the cost of an asset is evenly spread out over its useful life. So, the farmer bought the tractor for $40,000 and expects to use it for 20 years, with a salvage value of $10,000. 

First, I think I need to calculate the total depreciation over the 20 years. The cost is $40k and the salvage value is $10k, so the total depreciable amount is 40,000 minus 10,000, which equals 30,000. Then, I divide that by the number of years, which is 20. So 30,000 divided by 20 is 1,500. 

Wait, but the options don't have 1,500? Let me check the options again. Oh, option A is 1,500. So that would be the depreciation each year. But wait, let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Sometimes salvage value is subtracted, which I did, so the annual depreciation is 30k over 20 years, which is 1,500 per year. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is asking for something else. Like, perhaps including the salvage value differently? No, I think straight-line is just (Cost - Salvage) divided by Life. So yes, 1,500 per year. That would make the first year's depreciation $1,500. So the answer should be A.

The straight-line depreciation is calculated by subtracting the salvage value from the cost and dividing by the useful life. ($40,000 - $10,000) / 20 years = $1,500 per year.
