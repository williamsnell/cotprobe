Okay, so I've got this question about evidence law, specifically dealing with hearsay exceptions. Let's try to break it down step by step.

The scenario is that an investor is suing a corporation for stock fraud. During the trial, the investor wants to introduce a newspaper issue to show the corporation's stock price on a particular day. The corporation's attorney objects, and the question is about whether this evidence should be admitted or excluded.

First, I need to recall the basics of evidence law, particularly the hearsay rule. Hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted, and it's generally inadmissible unless there's an exception.

So, the newspaper article is being offered to show the stock price. That's a fact, and the newspaper is a published source. But the key here is whether this falls under a hearsay exception.

One of the common exceptions is the business records exception under FRE 803(6). This allows for the admission of records kept in the regular course of business, made at or near the time of the event, by someone with knowledge. But wait, the newspaper itself isn't the business that recorded the stock price. The stock price is recorded by the stock exchange or the company itself. The newspaper is just reporting on it. So does the newspaper article qualify as a business record?

Another point is the market reports exception under FRE 803(22). This exception applies to statements made in market reports, which are published statements of market prices. So if the newspaper is reporting the market's prices, that might fit here.

Wait, but does the market reports exception require the statement to be made by someone in the business of reporting market prices, like a stock exchange or a recognized financial publication? Or does a general newspaper suffice? I'm a bit fuzzy on that. I think the market reports exception is more specific, perhaps requiring the source to be an official or recognized market report.

Alternatively, if the newspaper is a reliable source, maybe the business records exception could apply. But the problem is that the newspaper isn't the one that generated the stock price; it's just reporting it. So the business records exception usually applies to the records made by the business itself, not third parties reporting on the business's data.

So, if the newspaper isn't a business that records stock prices but just reports them, then maybe the business records exception doesn't apply. But the market reports exception might. Because the newspaper is a published statement about market prices. So under 803(22), it might be admissible.

Wait, but I'm not 100% sure if a newspaper's report on stock prices falls under the market reports exception. Some sources say that market reports include statements made by brokers or official market reports, but a newspaper might not be considered an official market report. So perhaps the market reports exception doesn't apply here, making the evidence inadmissible because it's hearsay without an exception.

Alternatively, if the newspaper is a reliable source, maybe the business records exception could be stretched to include it. But I think the business records exception requires the record to be made by the business itself. The newspaper is reporting on the stock price, so it's not the business's own record.

So, without an applicable exception, the evidence is hearsay and should be excluded. Looking at the options, option H says excluded because it doesn't fit any established exception. Option J suggests it's admitted under the market reports exception, but I'm not certain if a newspaper qualifies under that.

Wait, another angle: maybe the best evidence rule comes into play. The best evidence rule requires the original document if it's a writing. But the newspaper is a published document, so maybe the original is available. However, the best evidence rule doesn't apply here because the content of the newspaper isn't being proven for its truth; it's being offered for the fact of the stock price, which is a matter of content, not the document itself. So the best evidence rule (option I) probably isn't the issue.

So, putting it all together, the newspaper article is hearsay. It's offered to prove the stock price, which is the truth of the matter asserted. There's no applicable exception, so the evidence should be excluded. Therefore, the correct answer is H: excluded, because it doesn't fit within any established exception.

The newspaper article is hearsay, as it is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the stock price. While the market reports exception (Option J) might apply if the source is considered an official market report, a general newspaper likely doesn't qualify. The business records exception (Option B) typically applies to records made by the business itself, not third-party reports. Without an applicable exception, the evidence should be excluded.
