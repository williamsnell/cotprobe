Okay, so I've got this problem about radioactive decay, and I need to find the decay rate r. Let me think through it step by step.

Alright, the problem says that thorium-234 decays at a rate proportional to the amount present. The differential equation given is dQ/dt = -rQ. I remember that the solution to this kind of equation is an exponential decay function. So, Q(t) = Q0 * e^(-rt), where Q0 is the initial amount.

They give me that 100 mg decays to 82.04 mg in 1 week. Wait, the time given is 1 week, but the options are in terms of per day. So I need to be careful with the units. Let me note that down: time given is 1 week, so that's 7 days. So t = 7 days.

So plugging in the values I have: Q(7) = 82.04 mg, Q0 = 100 mg, t =7 days. The equation becomes 82.04 = 100 * e^(-r*7). I need to solve for r.

First, divide both sides by 100 to get 0.8204 = e^(-7r). To solve for r, take the natural logarithm of both sides. So ln(0.8204) = -7r. Therefore, r = -ln(0.8204)/7.

Let me calculate ln(0.8204). Hmm, I remember that ln(1) is 0, and ln(e^-x) is -x. Since 0.8204 is less than 1, its ln will be negative. Let me approximate ln(0.8204).

Alternatively, maybe I can use a calculator if I think about it. Wait, perhaps I can compute it step by step. Let me think: ln(0.8) is about -0.2231, ln(0.82) is a bit higher... Maybe I can estimate or use a calculator approach.

Wait, perhaps I should just compute it numerically. Let's see: ln(0.8204) ≈ Let me calculate this.

Wait, I can use the Taylor series expansion around 1, but maybe that's too time-consuming. Alternatively, I can recall that ln(0.8) is approximately -0.2231, and since 0.8204 is a bit higher than 0.8, the ln will be less negative. Let me see, perhaps I can use a calculator-like approach here.

Wait, alternatively, maybe I can use the approximation that ln(x) ≈ (x-1) - (x-1)^2/2 + (x-1)^3/3 - ... for x near 1. But 0.8204 is 0.1796 below 1, which might make the series converge slowly. Maybe it's better to just compute it numerically.

Alternatively, maybe I can think that ln(0.8204) ≈ Let me use a calculator approach. Let me compute it as follows:

I know that e^0.2 ≈ 1.2214, so ln(1.2214) = 0.2. Similarly, e^-0.2 ≈ 0.8187, which is close to 0.8204. So ln(0.8187) ≈ -0.2. Since 0.8204 is a bit higher than 0.8187, the ln would be a bit more than -0.2. Let me compute ln(0.8204) more accurately.

Let me compute the difference: 0.8204 - 0.8187 = 0.0017. So the value is 0.0017 higher than 0.8187. So how much does that affect the ln?

We can approximate the derivative of ln(x) at x=0.8187. The derivative is 1/x, so 1/0.8187 ≈ 1.2214. So the change in x is 0.0017, so the change in ln(x) is approximately 1.2214 * 0.0017 ≈ 0.002076. Since x increased, ln(x) becomes less negative. So ln(0.8204) ≈ -0.2 + 0.002076 ≈ -0.197924.

Wait, let me check: 0.8187 is e^-0.2, so adding 0.0017, so x = 0.8187 + 0.0017 = 0.8204. The derivative of ln(x) is 1/x, so at x=0.8187, it's 1/0.8187 ≈ 1.2214. So delta_x = 0.0017, so delta_ln ≈ 1.2214 * 0.0017 ≈ 0.002076.

So ln(0.8204) ≈ ln(0.8187) + 0.002076 ≈ (-0.2) + 0.002076 ≈ -0.197924.

But wait, I think that might be an overestimation because the function is concave, so the linear approximation might not be perfectly accurate. Alternatively, perhaps I can accept that approximation for now.

So, r = (-ln(0.8204)) / 7 ≈ (0.197924) /7 ≈ 0.028275 per day.

Looking at the options, option F is 0.02828 per day, which is very close to what I got. So the answer should be F.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute ln(0.8204) more accurately.

Let me try using the calculator approach more carefully. Let's see, if I compute ln(0.8204):

We can use the fact that ln(1 - x) ≈ -x - x^2/2 - x^3/3 - ... for small x. But 0.8204 is 1 - 0.1796, which is not that small, so perhaps that's not the best approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use a better approximation. Let me see that e^-0.197924 ≈ 0.8204, as I thought earlier. So r would be approximately 0.197924 /7 ≈ 0.028275 per day, which is approximately 0.02828 per day, so option F.

Wait another way: perhaps I can compute this using a calculator. Let me think: if I had a calculator, I would compute ln(0.8204) as approximately -0.197924. Then divide by 7 days: 0.197924 /7 ≈ 0.028275, which is 0.02828 when rounded to five decimal places, so option F is 0.02828 day^-1.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute it using exact steps:

We have 82.04 = 100 * e^(-7r)
Divide both sides by 100: 0.8204 = e^(-7r)
Take ln: ln(0.8204) = -7r
So r = -ln(0.8204)/7

Calculating ln(0.8204) using a calculator: let's say I have a calculator. Let me compute 0.8204.

Using a calculator, ln(0.8204) is approximately -0.197924.

So r = 0.197924 /7 ≈ 0.028275 per day.

Looking at the options, option F is 0.02828, which matches closely. Therefore, the correct answer is F.

The decay follows an exponential model, Q(t) = Q0 * e^(-rt). Using the given values, we solve for r and find it to be approximately 0.02828 day⁻¹.
