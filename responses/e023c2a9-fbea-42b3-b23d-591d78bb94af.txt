Okay, so I need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 4 and 10. Hmm, I remember that the LCM is the smallest number that both of these numbers can divide into without leaving a remainder. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, maybe I should list the multiples of each number and see where they intersect. For 4, the multiples are 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, and so on. For 10, the multiples are 10, 20, 30, 40, etc. Looking at these lists, the first common multiple I see is 20. So that might be the LCM.

Wait, is there a quicker way than listing multiples? Oh right, I remember something about prime factors. Let me try that. The prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2, since 4 is 2 squared. For 10, the prime factors are 2 and 5. To find the LCM, I take the highest powers of all primes present. So that's 2^2 (from 4) and 5^1 (from 10). Multiplying those together gives 4 * 5 = 20. So that confirms it.

Alternatively, I could use the formula where LCM(a, b) = |a*b| / GCD(a, b). The GCD of 4 and 10 is 2 because 2 is the largest number that divides both without a remainder. So 4*10 is 40, divided by 2 gives 20. Yep, same result.

Looking at the options provided: A is 100, which is way too big. B is 20, which matches what I found. C is 14, which I don't think is a multiple of 4. 4 times 3 is 12, 4 times 4 is 16, so 14 isn't a multiple. D is 40, which is a multiple but higher than 20. E is 80, even bigger. F is 60, G is 70, H is 50, I is 200, J is 30. So the only correct one is B:20.
