Okay, so I need to solve this algebra problem where I'm given a quadratic equation, and I have to compute a specific expression involving its roots. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the equation is x² + 3x + 1 = 0. The roots of this equation are x₁ and x₂. I remember from Vieta's formulas that for a quadratic equation ax² + bx + c = 0, the sum of the roots is -b/a, and the product is c/a. So here, the sum x₁ + x₂ should be -3/1 = -3, and the product x₁x₂ is 1/1 = 1. Got that down.

Now, the expression I need to compute is (x₁/(x₂ + 1))² + (x₂/(x₁ + 1))². Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can simplify it somehow. Let me write it out:

Let me denote A = x₁/(x₂ + 1) and B = x₂/(x₁ + 1). So I need to find A² + B².

I remember that A² + B² can be rewritten using the identity (A + B)² - 2AB. So maybe if I can find A + B and AB, I can compute A² + B².

Let me compute A + B first. That's x₁/(x₂ + 1) + x₂/(x₁ + 1). To add these two fractions, I'll need a common denominator. The denominators are (x₂ + 1) and (x₁ + 1), so the common denominator is (x₂ + 1)(x₁ + 1).

So A + B = [x₁(x₁ + 1) + x₂(x₂ + 1)] / [(x₂ + 1)(x₁ + 1)].

Expanding the numerator: x₁² + x₁ + x₂² + x₂.

Hmm, I can write this as (x₁² + x₂²) + (x₁ + x₂). I know x₁ + x₂ is -3, so that part is easy. Now, what about x₁² + x₂²?

I remember that x₁² + x₂² can be expressed in terms of (x₁ + x₂)² - 2x₁x₂. So let's compute that:

(x₁ + x₂)² = (-3)² = 9. Then subtract 2*x₁x₂ which is 2*1=2. So x₁² + x₂² = 9 - 2 = 7.

So the numerator becomes 7 + (-3) = 4.

Now the denominator is (x₂ + 1)(x₁ + 1). Let me expand that:

(x₂ + 1)(x₁ + 1) = x₁x₂ + x₁ + x₂ + 1.

We know x₁x₂ = 1, x₁ + x₂ = -3, so substitute those in:

1 + (-3) + 1 = 1 - 3 + 1 = -1.

So A + B = numerator / denominator = 4 / (-1) = -4.

Okay, that's A + B. Now I need AB. Let's compute that.

AB is [x₁/(x₂ + 1)] * [x₂/(x₁ + 1)] = (x₁x₂) / [(x₂ + 1)(x₁ + 1)].

We already have x₁x₂ = 1, and the denominator is the same as before, which was -1. So AB = 1 / (-1) = -1.

Now, going back to the identity A² + B² = (A + B)² - 2AB.

We have A + B = -4, so (A + B)² = (-4)² = 16.

And AB = -1, so 2AB = 2*(-1) = -2.

So A² + B² = 16 - (-2) = 16 + 2 = 18.

Wait, but let me double-check that because I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me go through the steps again quickly.

Sum x₁ + x₂ = -3, product = 1.

Computed A + B as (x₁² + x₂² + x₁ + x₂)/denominator. x₁² + x₂² = 7, so 7 + (-3) = 4. Denominator was (x₁ + 1)(x₂ + 1) = -1. So A + B = 4 / (-1) = -4.

AB is (x₁x₂)/(-1) = 1/-1 = -1.

Then A² + B² = (-4)² - 2*(-1) = 16 + 2 = 18. So the answer should be 18, which is option D.

To solve the problem, we start by identifying the roots \(x_1\) and \(x_2\) of the quadratic equation \(x^2 + 3x + 1 = 0\). Using Vieta's formulas, we know that \(x_1 + x_2 = -3\) and \(x_1 x_2 = 1\).

We need to compute \(\left(\frac{x_1}{x_2 + 1}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{x_2}{x_1 + 1}\right)^2\). Let \(A = \frac{x_1}{x_2 + 1}\) and \(B = \frac{x_2}{x_1 + 1}\). The expression becomes \(A^2 + B^2\), which can be rewritten using the identity \(A^2 + B^2 = (A + B)^2 - 2AB\).

First, we compute \(A + B\):
\[
A + B = \frac{x_1}{x_2 + 1} + \frac{x_2}{x_1 + 1} = \frac{x_1(x_1 + 1) + x_2(x_2 + 1)}{(x_2 + 1)(x_1 + 1)}.
\]
Expanding the numerator:
\[
x_1^2 + x_1 + x_2^2 + x_2 = (x_1^2 + x_2^2) + (x_1 + x_2).
\]
Using \((x_1 + x_2)^2 = x_1^2 + 2x_1x_2 + x_2^2\), we find:
\[
x_1^2 + x_2^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2 = (-3)^2 - 2(1) = 9 - 2 = 7.
\]
Thus, the numerator becomes:
\[
7 + (-3) = 4.
\]
The denominator is:
\[
(x_2 + 1)(x_1 + 1) = x_1x_2 + x_1 + x_2 + 1 = 1 - 3 + 1 = -1.
\]
So, \(A + B = \frac{4}{-1} = -4\).

Next, we compute \(AB\):
\[
AB = \frac{x_1}{x_2 + 1} \cdot \frac{x_2}{x_1 + 1} = \frac{x_1x_2}{(x_2 + 1)(x_1 + 1)} = \frac{1}{-1} = -1.
\]

Using the identity \(A^2 + B^2 = (A + B)^2 - 2AB\):
\[
A^2 + B^2 = (-4)^2 - 2(-1) = 16 + 2 = 18.
\]

The final answer is \(\boxed{18}\).
