Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it says. The question is about a ball being thrown at a 45-degree angle to the ground. It lands 90 meters away, and I need to find the initial speed. The options are from A to J, with various speeds in meters per second.

Hmm, I remember from school that projectile motion problems can be solved using some kinematic equations. Since the ball is thrown at an angle, it'll have both horizontal and vertical components of velocity. Oh right, the horizontal component is v₀ * cos(theta), and the vertical is v₀ * sin(theta), where theta is 45 degrees here.

Wait, and since it lands 90 meters away, that's the range of the projectile. I think there's a formula for the range when the projectile is launched and lands at the same height. Yeah, the formula is R = (v₀² * sin(2θ)) / g, where R is the range, v₀ is the initial speed, θ is the angle, and g is the acceleration due to gravity, which I think is approximately 9.8 m/s².

So plugging in the numbers, R is 90 meters, θ is 45 degrees. Let me compute sin(2θ) first. 2θ would be 90 degrees, and sin(90) is 1. So the formula simplifies to R = (v₀²) / g. 

So 90 = (v₀²) / 9.8. I can rearrange that to solve for v₀²: v₀² = 90 * 9.8. Let me calculate that. 90 times 9 is 810, and 90 times 0.8 is 72, so total is 882. So v₀ squared is 882. Taking the square root of both sides, v₀ is sqrt(882). 

Hmm, what's sqrt(882)? Let me think. I know that 29 squared is 841 because 30² is 900. So 29² is 841, 29.5² would be (29 + 0.5)² = 29² + 2*29*0.5 + 0.5² = 841 + 29 + 0.25 = 870.25. That's still less than 882. Next, 29.7². Let's see: 29.7 * 29.7. Let me compute it: 30*30 is 900, but subtract 0.3*2*30 + 0.3². So 900 - 18 + 0.09 = 882.09. Oh, that's really close to 882. So v₀ is approximately 29.7 m/s. 

Wait, but none of the options exactly match 29.7. Let me check the options again. The options are:

A:50, B:45, C:25, D:20, E:35, F:55, G:40, H:15, I:28, J:30.

Hmm, 29.7 is closest to 30 m/s, which is option J. But wait, I thought the range formula only applies when the initial and final heights are the same. In this problem, it's thrown from the ground and lands on the ground, so that's correct.

Wait a second, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me redo the square root part. Let me compute 29.7 squared: 29 * 29 is 841, 0.7 squared is 0.49, and the cross term is 2 * 29 * 0.7 = 40.6. So 841 + 40.6 + 0.49 = 882.09. Yep, that's correct. So v₀ is about 29.7 m/s, which is approximately 30 m/s, so option J.

But looking at the options, option I is 28 m/s. Let me check if I messed up any calculations. Did I compute R correctly?

Wait, R = v₀² / g. So 90 = v₀² /9.8 → v₀² = 90 *9.8. 90 *9 is 810, 90 *0.8 is 72, so 882. That's correct. So sqrt(882) is about 29.7, which is almost 30 m/s. So the closest option is J:30.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought when θ is 45 degrees, you get the maximum range for a given speed. But here, the range is 90 m. Let me think—maybe I should check the formula again. The formula R = (v₀² sin(2θ)) / g. Since theta is 45, sin(90) is 1, so R = v₀² / g. That's correct.

Wait, another way to look at it: perhaps the answer expects to use g as 10 m/s² for simplicity, which is often done in textbook problems. Let's try that. So if g=10, then R = v₀² /10. So 90 = v₀² /10 → v₀²=900 → v₀=30 m/s. So that would make option J correct.

Yes, that makes sense. If they approximate g as 10, then it's exactly 30 m/s. So the answer should be J:30 m/s.

The problem involves finding the initial speed of a ball thrown at a 45° angle that lands 90 meters away. Using the range formula for projectile motion, \( R = \frac{v_0^2 \sin(2\theta)}{g} \), and knowing \( \theta = 45^\circ \) (so \( \sin(90^\circ) = 1 \)), the formula simplifies to \( R = \frac{v_0^2}{g} \). With \( R = 90 \, \mathrm{m} \) and \( g \approx 10 \, \mathrm{m/s^2} \) for simplicity, solving gives \( v_0^2 = 900 \) and \( v_0 = 30 \, \mathrm{m/s} \). Thus, the correct answer is J.

J: 30 m/s
