Question:

In making his original analysis of monopolistic competition, Edward Chamberlin assumed that all of the firms in an industry face similar cost and demand curves. What is the problem with this assumption?

Options:

A: The problem is that it assumes consumers have perfect information about all products, which is rarely the case.
B: The problem is that it does not account for the possibility of collusion among firms to set prices.
C: The problem is that firms would have different costs and face the same demand curves.
D: The problem is that it overlooks the impact of government regulations on cost structures and demand.
E: The problem is that it assumes no barriers to entry or exit in the market, which is not realistic.
F: The problem is that product differentiation would mean that firms would have the same costs and face the same demand curves.
G: The problem is that it ignores the potential for economies of scale that could lead to cost differences among firms.
H: The problem is that product differentiation would mean that firms would have different costs and face different demand curves.
I: The problem is that firms would have the same costs and face the same demand curves.
J: The problem is that all firms would have different costs but face identical demand curves due to perfect competition.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this economics question about Edward Chamberlin's analysis of monopolistic competition. The question is asking what's wrong with his assumption that all firms in an industry face similar cost and demand curves.

Hmm, I remember that Chamberlin's model is about monopolistic competition, which is different from perfect competition. In monopolistic competition, firms produce differentiated products. So each firm's product is slightly different from others, which affects their demand curves.

Wait, the question says Chamberlin assumed all firms have similar cost and demand curves. But isn't that a problem? Because in reality, if products are differentiated, each firm's demand curve should be different, right? Because uniqueness would mean that each firm's product has its own demand based on how much people like it compared to others.

So if he assumed similar cost and demand curves, that might not capture the essence of monopolistic competition. Because in that model, differentiation leads to each firm having its own demand curve. So the problem with his assumption is that he's assuming the opposite of what actually happens in monopolistic competition.

Looking at the options, option H says, "The problem is that product differentiation would mean that firms would have different costs and face different demand curves." That makes sense because differentiation leads to different demand curves, and maybe different costs too.

Option I says the opposite: same costs and same demand curves, which is what Chamberlin assumed. But that's not the problem; it's the assumption. The question is asking what's wrong with that assumption. So the problem is that this assumption is incorrect because in reality, differentiation leads to different demand curves.

Option C says, "The problem is that firms would have different costs and face the same demand curves." But that doesn't sound right because if they have different costs, that's one issue, but the demand curves being the same would also be a problem, but I think the main issue is more about the demand curves being different.

Option G talks about economies of scale leading to cost differences. That's a point, but the question is about Chamberlin's assumption, and I think the main issue is about demand curves, not necessarily cost differences, although in monopolistic competition, costs can vary too.

So, putting it together, the problem is that Chamberlin's assumption of similar cost and demand curves doesn't account for product differentiation, which should lead to different demand curves for each firm. Therefore, the correct answer should be H.

The problem with Edward Chamberlin's assumption is that it overlooks the impact of product differentiation, which leads to firms having different demand curves.
