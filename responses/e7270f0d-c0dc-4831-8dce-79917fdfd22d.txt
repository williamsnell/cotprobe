Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again.

The question is about a grain of sand with a mass of 10^-5 grams. It needs to fall from rest through a certain height so that its kinetic energy equals the energy of a quantum of visible light with a frequency of 5 × 10^14 Hz. The options are given from A to J, and I need to pick the correct one.

Hmm, I remember that the energy of a photon is given by E = hν, where h is Planck's constant. And kinetic energy is (1/2)mv², but since the grain falls from rest, that's also the gravitational potential energy converted into kinetic, so maybe I can use mgh = (1/2)mv²? Or wait, since the potential energy lost (mgh) equals the kinetic energy gained (½mv²). Right, so mgh = ½mv².

Wait, but wait, the problem says the kinetic energy equals the energy of a quantum of light. So the kinetic energy of the sand grain is equal to the photon's energy. So I can set mgh equal to hν, where h is Planck's constant.

Wait, but wait, I'm using h twice here. Planck's constant is h, and gravitational acceleration is g. Hmm, maybe I should use different letters or make sure I'm clear about what each h represents. Oh, wait, no, in the problem, the energy from the fall is the kinetic energy, which comes from the gravitational potential energy. So mgh is the potential energy lost, which equals the kinetic energy (½mv²), and that's equal to the photon's energy E_photon = hν.

So, setting mgh = hν. Wait, that doesn't seem right because then the h would cancel out. Let me think again.

No, wait, the potential energy is mgh, which equals the kinetic energy (½mv²), and that's equal to the photon's energy hν. So mgh = hν. Wait, but that would mean mgh = hν. So I can cancel h from both sides, getting mg = ν. But that doesn't make sense because units don't match. Oh wait, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, no, perhaps I should write the equation correctly. The kinetic energy is equal to the photon's energy. So mgh = hν. Wait, that would mean mgh = hν, so h cancels, leaving mg = ν. But that can't be right because ν is in Hz (s^-1) and mg would be in units of force, which is different. So I must have made a mistake in setting up the equation.

Wait a second, let me think again. The kinetic energy (½mv²) is equal to the photon's energy (hν). So I can write ½mv² = hν. But since the sand falls from rest, the kinetic energy comes from the potential energy loss, so mgh = ½mv². Therefore, mgh = hν. Wait, that leads me to mgh = hν, which again would imply mg = ν, which is impossible because of unit mismatch.

Ah, I see my mistake. The h in Planck's constant is not the same as the h in height. Oh no, I'm using the same symbol h for two different things, which is confusing. Let me clarify:

Let me denote the Planck's constant as h_p (h_p = 6.626 × 10^-34 J·s), and the height as h. So the photon energy is E_photon = h_p ν.

The potential energy lost by the sand grain is mgh, where m is mass, g is acceleration due to gravity (9.8 m/s²), and h is the height. So mgh = E_photon = h_p ν.

So the equation is mgh = h_p ν.

I need to solve for h, so h = (h_p ν) / (m g).

Wait, but the mass m is given as 10^-5 grams. I should convert that to kilograms because the standard unit for mass in physics is kg. So 10^-5 grams is 10^-5 × 10^-3 kg = 10^-8 kg.

Wait, wait, grams to kilograms: 1 gram = 0.001 kg, so 10^-5 grams = 10^-5 × 10^-3 kg = 10^-8 kg.

So putting in the values:

h = (h_p ν) / (m g)

Plugging in the numbers:

h_p = 6.626 × 10^-34 J·s

ν = 5 × 10^14 Hz

m = 10^-8 kg

g = 9.8 m/s²

So:

h = (6.626e-34 J·s * 5e14 Hz) / (10^-8 kg * 9.8 m/s²)

Let me calculate the numerator and denominator separately.

Numerator: 6.626e-34 *5e14 = 6.626 *5 = 33.13, and 10^-34 *10^14 = 10^-20. So 33.13e-20 J·s·Hz. Wait, but Hz is 1/s, so J·s * 1/s = J. So the numerator is 33.13e-20 J.

Denominator: 10^-8 kg * 9.8 m/s² = 9.8e-8 kg·m/s². But kg·m/s² is Newtons (N), so denominator is 9.8e-8 N.

So h = (33.13e-20 J) / (9.8e-8 N) 

But J is equal to N·m, so J/N = m. So units are meters.

Calculating the value:

33.13e-20 / 9.8e-8 = (33.13 /9.8) * (1e-20 / 1e-8) ) 

33.13 /9.8 ≈ 3.38

1e-20 /1e-8 = 1e-12

So 3.38e-12 meters.

Wait, but the options are given in centimeters. So I need to convert meters to centimeters.

1 meter = 100 cm, so 3.38e-12 meters = 3.38e-12 * 100 cm = 3.38e-10 cm.

Now, looking at the options, E is 3.38 × 10^-10 cm. So that should be the answer.

The problem involves determining the height a grain of sand must fall to have kinetic energy equal to the energy of a quantum of visible light with a given frequency. Using the equations for gravitational potential energy and photon energy, the height is calculated to be approximately \(3.38 \times 10^{-10}\) cm, corresponding to option E.
