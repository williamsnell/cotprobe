Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this economics question about how an increase in the price of imported forklifts affects two economic indicators: the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and the GDP deflator. I'm a bit rusty on these concepts, but let's break it down step by step.

First, I remember that the Consumer Price Index measures the average change in prices that consumers pay for a basket of goods and services. So, if the price of forklifts goes up, and they're something that consumers buy, then the CPI should go up. But wait, are forklifts something that regular consumers buy? I think forklifts are more likely to be used in businesses, like in warehouses or factories. So maybe they're not part of the typical consumer basket. That could mean that the CPI isn't affected. Hmm, I'm not sure about that.

Now, the GDP deflator is a broader measure of price changes in the economy. It includes all goods and services produced in the economy, not just what consumers buy. So if the price of forklifts increases and they're part of business investment or production, the GDP deflator would reflect that change. But wait, the forklifts are imported, so does that matter? I think the GDP deflator looks at all transactions within the economy, including imports because they're part of total spending. So an increase in their price would affect the GDP deflator.

Wait, but the question is about the price of imported forklifts. So if the price goes up, does that mean the cost of goods used in production (like in manufacturing) increases? That could affect the overall price level in the economy, which would be captured in the GDP deflator. But again, for the CPI, unless consumers directly buy forklifts, which I don't think they do, the CPI might not be affected.

So putting it together: The GDP deflator would increase because it includes all goods and services, including business inputs like forklifts. The CPI might not increase because consumers don't typically buy forklifts. Therefore, the correct answer would be that the GDP deflator increases but the CPI doesn't. Looking at the options, that's option C.

The increase in the price of imported forklifts would affect the GDP deflator because it measures all goods and services, including business inputs. However, since forklifts are not typically purchased by consumers, the CPI remains unaffected. Therefore, the correct answer is:

C
