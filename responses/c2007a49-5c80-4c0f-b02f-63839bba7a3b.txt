Okay, so I need to figure out how to calculate the work done in lifting the coal up the mine shaft. Hmm, let's see. The cable weighs 2 lb per foot, and it's used to lift 800 lb of coal up a 500 ft deep shaft. Work done against gravity usually involves integrating force over distance, but I have to think about how both the coal and the cable contribute to the force being lifted.

Wait, so the cable's weight is distributed along the shaft. As we lift the coal higher, the length of cable that's hanging decreases, right? Because as you lift, less cable is needed to support the coal. So the force from the cable's weight isn't constant; it changes as the coal is lifted.

Let me break it down. The total work done is the sum of the work done to lift the coal and the work done to lift the cable.

First, the coal is 800 lb, and it needs to be lifted 500 ft. So the work done for the coal alone would be force times distance, which is 800 lb * 500 ft = 400,000 ft-lb. That's straightforward.

Now, the cable is 2 lb per foot, and as we lift the coal up, the amount of cable being lifted at each point changes. Initially, when the coal is at the bottom, the cable hanging is 500 ft, so the force from the cable is 2 lb/ft * 500 ft = 1000 lb. But as we lift the coal up by a small distance, say Δy, the length of cable left to lift decreases by Δy, so the force also decreases.

To model this, I can think of dividing the cable into infinitesimal segments. Suppose I take a small segment dy at a height y from the bottom. The length of cable left to lift when the coal is at height y is (500 - y) feet. So the force due to the cable at that point is 2 lb/ft * (500 - y) ft = 2*(500 - y) lb.

The work done to lift this small segment dy is the force times the distance dy, which is 2*(500 - y) * dy. To find the total work done for the cable, I need to integrate this from y = 0 to y = 500.

So the integral becomes ∫ from 0 to 500 of 2*(500 - y) dy. Let me compute that:

First, expand the integrand: 2*(500 - y) = 1000 - 2y.

Integrate term by term:
∫1000 dy from 0 to 500 is 1000y evaluated from 0 to 500, which is 1000*500 - 0 = 500,000.

∫2y dy from 0 to 500 is y² evaluated from 0 to 500, which is 500² - 0 = 250,000. But since it's -2y, the integral becomes - (500²) = -250,000.

Adding them together: 500,000 - 250,000 = 250,000 ft-lb.

Wait, that's the work done for the cable. So the total work is the sum of the work for the coal and the work for the cable.

Coal: 400,000 ft-lb
Cable: 250,000 ft-lb
Total work = 400,000 + 250,000 = 650,000 ft-lb.

Looking at the options, F is 650,000 ft-lb. So that should be the answer.

The work done involves lifting both the coal and the cable. The coal requires 400,000 ft-lb, and the cable adds 250,000 ft-lb, totaling 650,000 ft-lb.
