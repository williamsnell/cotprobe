Question:

Consider a periodic signal $x(t)$ with period $(T)$ equals to ten. Over one period (i.e., $-5 \leq t<5)$, it is defined as $$ x(t)=\left\{\begin{array}{cc} 2 & -5 \leq t<0 \\ -2 & 0 \leq t<5 \end{array}\right. $$ In Fourier series, the signal $x(t)$ is written in the form of $$ x(t)=\sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty} c_k e^{\frac{j 2 \pi k t}{T}} $$ where the Fourier series coefficient $c_k$ is obtained as, $$ c_k=\frac{1}{T} \int_{-\frac{T}{2}}^{\frac{T}{2}} x(t) e^{-\frac{j 2 \pi k t}{T}} d t $$ Determine the value of $c_0$ (i.e., $\left.k=0\right)$

Options:

B: 3
C: 2
D: -3
E: 0
F: -1

Okay, so I have this problem about Fourier series and I need to find the value of c_0. Hmm, let me think. I remember that in Fourier series, each term is a complex exponential, and the coefficients c_k are calculated using an integral over one period of the signal multiplied by the exponential's conjugate.

The signal x(t) is periodic with period T=10. So the period is from -5 to 5, right? Because T=10, so half the period is 5. The function is defined as 2 when t is between -5 and 0, and -2 when t is between 0 and 5. So it's a square wave that alternates between 2 and -2 every 5 units.

The formula for c_k is (1/T) times the integral from -T/2 to T/2 of x(t) times e^(-j2Ï€kt/T) dt. Since we're looking for c_0, let me plug in k=0 into the formula. So c_0 becomes (1/10) times the integral from -5 to 5 of x(t) times e^(0) dt, because when k=0, the exponent is zero. And e^0 is 1, so that simplifies things.

So now, the integral is just the integral of x(t) from -5 to 5. Let's break that into two parts: from -5 to 0, x(t)=2, and from 0 to 5, x(t)=-2. Therefore, the integral becomes the integral from -5 to 0 of 2 dt plus the integral from 0 to 5 of (-2) dt.

Calculating each part: the first integral is 2*(0 - (-5)) = 2*5 = 10. The second integral is (-2)*(5 - 0) = (-2)*5 = -10. Adding these together: 10 + (-10) = 0. So the integral is zero.

Then, c_0 is (1/10) multiplied by zero, which is zero. So c_0 must be zero. Looking at the options, E is 0. So the answer should be E.

The value of \( c_0 \) is determined by integrating the signal over one period. The integral of the square wave over its period cancels out, resulting in zero.

Answer: E
