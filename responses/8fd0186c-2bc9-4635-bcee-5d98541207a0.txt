Okay, so I've got this problem about a man selling novelty items. Let me try to figure it out. Hmm. 

The question says he sells each item for $1.25. His cost per unit is $0.75, and he has a fixed cost of $140,000. The question is asking how many items he needs to sell to break even and what his sales revenue would be at that point. The options are A to J, so I need to pick the right one.

Oh wait, break even. That's when his total revenue equals his total cost. So I remember that the break-even point is calculated by dividing fixed costs by (selling price per unit minus variable cost per unit). 

Let me write that down. 

Fixed cost is $140,000. Selling price is $1.25, and variable cost is $0.75. So the contribution margin per unit is 1.25 minus 0.75, which is $0.50. 

So the number of units needed to break even is fixed cost divided by contribution margin. Let me calculate that. 140,000 divided by 0.50. Hmm, 0.5 goes into 140,000 how many times? 140,000 / 0.5 is the same as 140,000 * 2, which is 280,000 units. Wait, because 0.5 is half, so each unit covers half a dollar towards the fixed cost. So yes, 280,000 units.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check that. Multiply 280,000 by 0.5 (the contribution per unit). 280,000 * 0.5 is 140,000. So yes, that's correct.

So the break-even point is 280,000 units. But looking at the options, option H says 280,000 units, and the revenue would be 280,000 multiplied by $1.25. Let me see. 280,000 * 1.25. 280,000 * 1 is 280,000, and 280,000 * 0.25 is 70,000. So total is 350,000. 

Wait, but looking at the options, option H says revenue is $350,000. So that seems to match. Let me check other options to make sure none are better.

Option A is 180,000 units and $225k. If he sells 180,000, the revenue is 180,000 * 1.25 = 225,000. But the cost would be 180,000 * (0.75 + 140,000). Wait, no, the cost per unit is fixed plus variable. So each unit costs him 0.75 plus whatever the fixed cost is spread over. But fixed is a one-time cost, so the cost is 140,000 + 0.75 * units. 

So at 180,000 units, total cost is 140,000 + 0.75 * 180,000 = 140,000 + 135,000 = 275,000. Revenue is 225,000, which is less than cost. So he hasn't broken even yet. So option A is incorrect.

Option B: 220k units. Revenue is 220,000 * 1.25 = 275,000. Cost is 140k + 0.75*220k = 140,000 + 165,000 = 305k. So revenue 275k is less than cost 305k. Not break even.

Option C: 240,000 units. Revenue is 240k * 1.25 = 300k. Cost is 140k + 0.75*240k = 140k + 180k = 320k. Revenue 300 is less than 320. Not break even.

Option D: 200k units. Revenue 200,000 * 1.25 = 250k. Cost is 140k + 0.75*200k = 140k + 150k = 290k. So revenue 250k < 290k.

Option E: 350k units. Revenue is 350k * 1.25 = 437,500. Cost is 140k + 0.75*350k = 140k + 262.5k = 402.5k. So revenue 437k > cost 402.5k. So he's making a profit of 35k. Not break even.

Option F: 260k units. Revenue is 260k * 1.25 = 325k. Cost: 140k + 0.75*260k = 140k + 195k = 335k. So revenue 325k < 335k. So he hasn't broken even.

Option G: 250k units. Revenue: 250k * 1.25 = 312.5k. Cost: 140k + 0.75*250k = 140 + 187.5k = 327.5k. So revenue 312.5 < 327.5. Not break even.

Option I: 300k units. Revenue 375k. Cost 140k + 0.75*300k = 140k + 225k = 365k. So revenue 375k > 365k. Profit of 10k.

Option J: 320k units. Revenue 320k *1.25= 400k. Cost 140k + 0.75*320k = 140 + 240k = 380k. So revenue 400k > 380k. Profit 20k.

So, the only option where revenue equals cost is option H, where 280k units are sold, leading to revenue of 350k. So the correct answer should be H.

The correct answer is **H: 280,000 units and $350,000**. 

**Explanation:**
To determine the break-even point, we calculate the number of units needed such that total revenue equals total cost. The contribution margin per unit is $1.25 - $0.75 = $0.50. Dividing fixed costs ($140,000) by contribution margin gives 280,000 units. At this point, revenue is 280,000 * $1.25 = $350,000, which equals total cost.

**Answer:**
H
