Okay, so I have this question about translating the English statement "All robots are artifacts" into predicate logic. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

First, I need to understand what the statement means. "All robots are artifacts" implies that if something is a robot, then it must be an artifact. So, the relationship here is that being a robot is a subset of being an artifact.

In predicate logic, this kind of universal statement usually starts with a universal quantifier, which is "∀x". Then, I need to express the implication. The structure would be something like: For all x, if x is a robot, then x is an artifact.

Looking at the options, I see that some use subset symbols (⊂) and others use logical implications with arrows (⊃). I remember that in formal logic, the subset symbol is often used in predicate calculus, but sometimes people use the implication arrow as well, depending on the notation.

So, the statement can be written as ∀x (Rx → Ax), where Rx is "x is a robot" and Ax is "x is an artifact". Now I need to look at the options to see which one matches this.

Option A is (∀x)(Rx ⊂ Ax). Since ⊂ means subset, this would mean that all robots are a subset of artifacts, which is the same as saying if x is a robot, then x is an artifact. So that seems correct.

Option B is (∀x)(Ax ⊃ Rx). This would mean if x is an artifact, then x is a robot, which is the opposite of what we want. So B is incorrect.

Option C is (∀x)(Ax ⊂ Rx). Again, this would mean that being an artifact implies being a robot, which is not what the statement says.

Option D is (∀x)(Ax ∨ Rx). This translates to "x is an artifact or a robot." But the original statement is about all robots being artifacts, not about them being either one or the other.

Option E is (∀x)(Ax • Rx). This would mean that all x are both artifacts and robots, which is too strong and not the same as saying all robots are artifacts.

Option F is (∀x)(Rx ⊃ Ax). This is the same as ∀x (if Rx then Ax), which correctly states that all robots are artifacts. So F also looks correct.

Wait, now I'm confused because both A and F seem to match. Let me double-check.

I think the difference is in the notation. The subset symbol (⊂) is sometimes used in predicate calculus as an alternative to the implication arrow. So Rx ⊂ Ax is equivalent to Rx → Ax. Therefore, both A and F are correct, but looking at the options, I need to see which one uses the correct notation.

Wait, looking back, the question is about translating into predicate logic, and I think the standard way is to use the implication arrow. So the correct form would be ∀x (Rx → Ax), which is option F.

Alternatively, if the subset symbol is being used correctly, then option A would also be correct. But I'm not entirely sure if ⊂ is used in predicate logic for this purpose or if it's more of a set theory notation.

In predicate logic, the standard is to use the implication, so F is the right answer. A might be using subset notation, but I'm not certain if that's the correct approach here.

The statement "All robots are artifacts" translates to ∀x (Rx → Ax), which corresponds to option F.

Answer: F
