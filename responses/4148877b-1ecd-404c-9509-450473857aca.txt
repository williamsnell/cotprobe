Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about length contraction in special relativity. Alright, let me try to break it down. So, the question is: A rod measures 1.00 meters in its rest system. How fast must an observer move parallel to the rod to measure its length to be 0.80 meters?

Hmm, I remember that in special relativity, when an object is moving relative to an observer, its length in the direction of motion is contracted. The formula for length contraction is L = L0 * sqrt(1 - v²/c²), where L is the contracted length, L0 is the proper length (the rest length), v is the relative velocity, and c is the speed of light.

Wait, wait. So in this case, the proper length L0 is 1.00 m, and the observed length L is 0.80 m. I need to find v.

Let me write that down. The formula becomes:

L = L0 * sqrt(1 - v²/c²)

Rearranging to solve for v, I think I can start by dividing both sides by L0. So,

L / L0 = sqrt(1 - v²/c²)

Plugging the numbers in:

0.80 m / 1.00 m = sqrt(1 - v²/c²)

Which simplifies to 0.8 = sqrt(1 - v²/c²)

Now, I'll square both sides to get rid of the square root:

0.8² = 1 - v²/c²

0.64 = 1 - v²/c²

Then, rearranging to solve for v²/c²:

v²/c² = 1 - 0.64 = 0.36

So v² = 0.36 c²

Taking the square root of both sides, v = sqrt(0.36) * c = 0.6c

Wait, so that's 0.6 times the speed of light. Let me check the options. Option E is 0.60c, so that should be the right answer.

But wait, was there any mistake in the steps? Let me double-check. The formula for length contraction is correct, right? Yes, because the moving object's length is shorter. So L = L0 * sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Plugging in 0.8 for L and 1 for L0, everything looks okay.

Wait another thing, when v is 0.6c, does that make sense? Because I recall that at v=0.8c, the gamma factor is 1.666..., but here we're dealing with length contraction. So yeah, the calculation seems right. So the answer should be E: 0.60c.

The problem involves calculating the relative velocity required for length contraction in special relativity. Using the formula for length contraction, \( L = L_0 \sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2} \), and substituting \( L = 0.80 \, \text{m} \) and \( L_0 = 1.00 \, \text{m} \), the velocity \( v \) is found to be \( 0.6c \).

Answer: E
