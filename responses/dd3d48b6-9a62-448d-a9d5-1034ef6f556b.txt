Okay, so I've got this problem here where Vinnie wants to sell an item he bought for $18.20, and he's marking it up by 40% based on the selling price. Hmm, I'm a bit confused about what that means exactly. Let me think this through step by step.

So, the cost price is $18.20. He wants a 40% markup on the selling price. Wait, markup can be a bit tricky because it's based on the selling price, not the cost. I remember that when the markup is based on cost, it's straightforward, but here it's based on the selling price. So, I need to figure out how that affects the calculation.

Let me denote the selling price as S. The markup is 40% of S, which means Vinnie adds 40% of S to his cost to get the selling price. So, the cost plus 40% of S equals S. In equation form, that would be:

Cost + (40% of S) = S

Or, mathematically:

18.20 + 0.40S = S

Now, I can solve for S. Let me subtract 0.40S from both sides to get the terms involving S on one side.

18.20 = S - 0.40S

Simplifying the right side:

18.20 = 0.60S

So, to find S, I divide both sides by 0.60.

S = 18.20 / 0.60

Let me do the division. 18.20 divided by 0.60. Hmm, 18 divided by 0.6 is 30, because 0.6 times 30 is 18. Then, 0.20 divided by 0.60 is about 0.333... So, adding those together, 30 + 0.333 is approximately 30.333.

So, S is approximately $30.33. Let me check the options. Option C is $30.33. That seems right.

Wait, just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let me verify the calculation again. 0.60 times 30.33 should equal 18.20.

0.60 * 30 = 18, and 0.60 * 0.33 is 0.198. Adding them together gives 18 + 0.198 = 18.198, which is approximately $18.20. That checks out.

So, yeah, the selling price should be $30.33, which is option C.

The correct answer is C: $30.33.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Cost Price (CP) = $18.20
   - Markup = 40% of Selling Price (SP)
   - We need to find SP.

2. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - CP + Markup = SP
   - 18.20 + 0.40SP = SP

3. **Rearrange the Equation:**
   - 18.20 = SP - 0.40SP
   - 18.20 = 0.60SP

4. **Solve for SP:**
   - SP = 18.20 / 0.60 ≈ $30.33

5. **Verify the Calculation:**
   - 0.60 * 30.33 ≈ 18.20, confirming the calculation.

**Answer:** C
