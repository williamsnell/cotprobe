Question:

What do the results of studies with twins suggest about the influence of heredity on personality?

Options:

A: Heredity dictates personality completely, and the environment has no impact.
B: Identical twins raised apart will have completely different personalities due to environmental differences.
C: Personality traits are inherited in a fixed pattern, similar to physical traits like eye color.
D: Heredity determines intelligence, which in turn completely determines personality.
E: Heredity has no influence on personality.
F: Personalities are influenced only by peer interactions, not by heredity or family environment.
G: Fraternal twins have more similar personalities than identical twins due to shared environments.
H: Heredity provides a capacity for a wide range of behavior that may then be encouraged or sustained by the environment.
I: Environment solely determines personality traits.
J: Identical twins always have identical personalities.

Okay, so I've got this question about twin studies and their implications on heredity's influence on personality. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that twin studies are often used to figure out the role of genetics versus environment in traits like personality. There are two types of twins: identical and fraternal. Identical twins share more of their genetic material, right? Fraternal twins are like regular siblings, sharing about half their genes.

So the question is asking what these studies suggest about heredity's role. Let's look at the options.

Option A says heredity dictates personality completely, with no environment impact. That seems too strong. I don't think nature is that absolute. There's got to be some influence from the environment too.

Option B claims identical twins raised apart will have completely different personalities because of environment. Wait, I think I've read that even when raised apart, identical twins are still more similar than fraternal twins. So B might not be right because it's not completely different.

Option C says personality traits are inherited in a fixed pattern, like eye color. Hmm, fixed patterns? I'm not sure. I think personality is more complex and influenced by both genes and environment, so maybe C isn't the best choice.

Option D suggests heredity determines intelligence, which then completely determines personality. That seems a bit off. Intelligence is part of it, but personality isn't solely determined by intelligence, and I don't think it's completely due to heredity either.

Option E states heredity has no influence. That can't be right because twin studies do show some hereditary influence on personality.

Option F says personalities are only influenced by peers, not heredity or family. No, that doesn't make sense. Family environment definitely plays a role, and so does heredity.

Option G claims fraternal twins have more similar personalities than identical twins due to shared environments. Wait, no, I think it's the opposite. Identical twins are more similar because they share more genes, even if they're raised apart. So G is probably incorrect.

Option H says heredity provides a capacity for a wide range of behavior, which the environment then encourages or sustains. That sounds plausible. It suggests that genes set some parameters, but the environment shapes how those traits are expressed. I think this aligns with what I know about the nature-nurture interaction.

Option I states the environment solely determines personality. No, that's too extreme. Twin studies show heredity plays a significant role, so I is incorrect.

Option J says identical twins always have identical personalities. That's not true. Even identical twins have some differences, probably due to environmental factors.

So putting it all together, the best answer is H. It captures the idea that heredity sets the stage for possible traits, and the environment influences how those traits develop.
