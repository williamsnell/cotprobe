Okay, so I've got this question about banking and how demand deposits can expand. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think through it step by step.

The question says a bank has total reserves of $1000 and demand deposits of $2000. The required reserve ratio is 20%. So, I need to find out how much the demand deposits can expand in the banking system. The options are from A to J, and I have to pick the right one.

First, I remember that banks are required to hold a certain percentage of their deposits as reserves. The required reserve ratio (RRR) is given, which is 20% or 0.2 in decimal. So, for every dollar deposited, the bank must keep 20% in reserves and can lend out the rest.

Wait, but the question is about how much demand deposits can expand. I think this relates to the concept of the money multiplier effect. The money multiplier tells us how much the money supply can increase based on the reserves banks hold.

The formula for the money multiplier is 1 divided by the required reserve ratio. So, if the RRR is 20%, the multiplier would be 1 / 0.2 = 5. That means each dollar of reserves can lead to a $5 increase in the money supply, which includes demand deposits.

But wait, in this case, the bank already has $1000 in reserves and $2000 in demand deposits. Let me make sure I'm calculating the correct expansion. The total deposits are $2000, and with a 20% RRR, the required reserves would be 20% of $2000, which is $400. But the bank has $1000 in reserves, which is more than the required $400. The extra reserves are $1000 - $400 = $600. These extra reserves can be used to create more loans, which in turn create more deposits.

So, the extra reserves of $600 can be lent out, and each loan becomes new deposits. Using the money multiplier, the maximum expansion would be $600 * 5 = $3000. But wait, the existing deposits are $2000. So, does the expansion add to that? Or is the question asking about the total possible expansion from the current point?

Wait, I think I might be mixing things up. The initial reserves are $1000, and the initial deposits are $2000. The required reserves are 20% of $2000, which is $400. So the bank has excess reserves of $1000 - $400 = $600. These excess reserves can be used to create more loans, which then increase the deposits.

The formula for the maximum possible expansion of deposits is (Excess Reserves) multiplied by (1 / RRR). So, excess reserves are $600, and RRR is 0.2. So, 600 * (1/0.2) = 600 * 5 = $3000. But wait, that would be the total new deposits created, right? Or is it the additional amount beyond the initial?

Wait, the initial deposits are $2000. If the expansion is $3000, does that mean the total deposits would go up to $5000? But the question is asking how much the demand deposits can expand, so it's the increase, not the total. So the expansion would be $3000.

Wait, looking at the options, option G is $3000. But wait, another thought: the initial reserves are $1000, and the initial deposits are $2000. The bank's required reserves are 20% of $2000, which is $400. So the excess is $600, which can be used to create new loans. Each loan leads to new deposits, and so on.

Alternatively, maybe I should calculate the maximum possible deposits based on the initial reserves. The formula for maximum money created from reserves is Reserves * (1 / RRR). So, $1000 * 5 = $5000. But the bank already has $2000 in deposits. So the expansion would be $5000 - $2000 = $3000. So the same result as before.

But wait, another approach: The money multiplier is 5. The bank's excess reserves are $600, so the maximum expansion is $600 * 5 = $3000. So the demand deposits can expand by $3000, making the total deposits $2000 + $3000 = $5000. So the expansion is $3000. So option G is $3000.

But looking at the options, option G is $3000. But wait, another way: The total reserves are $1000, and the required reserves are 20% of total deposits. So if the total deposits are D, then required reserves are 0.2D. The bank has $1000 in reserves, so 0.2D = 1000 â†’ D = 5000. So the maximum possible demand deposits are $5000. Since the current deposits are $2000, the expansion is 5000 - 2000 = $3000. So again, the answer is $3000, which is option G.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes the formula is applied differently. Let me make sure. The maximum expansion is determined by the excess reserves multiplied by the money multiplier. So, excess reserves = total reserves - required reserves. Required reserves = 0.2 * 2000 = 400. So excess is 1000 - 400 = 600. Then, 600 * (1/0.2) = 3000. So yes, the expansion is $3000, which is option G.

But wait, looking at the options again: A is 2000, which is the current deposits. B is 400, which is the required reserves. C is 1200, D is 800, E is 10000, F is 5000, G is 3000, H is 600, I is 1600, J is 7000.

Wait, but another thought: Sometimes, the money expansion is calculated as (Excess Reserves) / Required Reserve Ratio. So 600 / 0.2 = 3000. So that's the same as before.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the maximum possible expansion, which would be based on the initial reserves, not the excess. So, initial reserves are $1000, so maximum expansion is 1000 * 5 = 5000. But the current deposits are 2000, so the expansion is 5000 - 2000 = 3000. So again, $3000, which is option G.

Wait, but another angle: The money multiplier is 5, so the maximum expansion is 5 times the initial excess reserves. Or initial reserves minus required reserves. Either way, it's 600 *5=3000.

So I think the correct answer is G, $3000.

The correct answer is G, $3000. Here's the step-by-step explanation:

1. **Required Reserves Calculation**: The bank has demand deposits of $2000 and a required reserve ratio (RRR) of 20%. Thus, the required reserves are 20% of $2000, which is $400.

2. **Excess Reserves Calculation**: The bank has total reserves of $1000. Subtracting the required reserves ($400) from the total reserves gives the excess reserves: $1000 - $400 = $600.

3. **Money Multiplier**: The money multiplier is calculated as 1 / RRR. With an RRR of 20% (or 0.2), the multiplier is 1 / 0.2 = 5.

4. **Expansion of Demand Deposits**: The excess reserves ($600) can be used to create new loans, which in turn increase demand deposits. Using the money multiplier, the maximum expansion is $600 * 5 = $3000.

5. **Conclusion**: The demand deposits can expand by $3000, making the total demand deposits $2000 + $3000 = $5000. The expansion amount is $3000.
