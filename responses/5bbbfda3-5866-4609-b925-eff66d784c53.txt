Alright, so I've got this multiple-choice question about philosophy, and I need to figure out which philosopher called natural rights 'nonsense on stilts'. I'm a bit rusty on my philosophy, but let me think this through step by step.

First, I remember that 'nonsense on stilts' is a famous phrase. I think it's a criticism of something, maybe a concept that someone found illogical or baseless. The question is about natural rights, so I'm guessing the philosopher in question has some strong opinion against the idea of natural rights.

Looking at the options, the choices are A through J. Let me go through each one:

A: Socrates – He was more into ethics and the Socratic method, I think. Not sure he's known for that phrase.

B: John Locke – He's famous for his ideas on natural rights, like life, liberty, and property. He actually supports them, so it's unlikely he would call them nonsense.

C: Immanuel Kant – He's a big name in ethics, especially with his deontological theories. I don't recall him using that phrase, though.

D: Emmanuel Kant – Wait, isn't that the same as Immanuel Kant? Maybe a typo. So same as C.

E: René Descartes – He's more about rationalism and mind-body dualism. Doesn't seem related.

F: Thomas Hobbes – He wrote about the social contract and Leviathan. He was a bit skeptical about natural rights, but I'm not sure if he used that exact phrase.

G: Alan Gerwith – I'm not familiar with this name; maybe a less-known philosopher, but I don't recall the phrase being attributed to him.

H: Jeremy Bentham – He was a utilitarian, focusing on happiness as the basis of morality. I think he had strong opinions on legal systems and might have criticized certain concepts. The phrase 'nonsense on stilts' rings a bell with him. I think he was critical of natural rights, arguing that they're baseless.

I: John Stuart Mill – He expanded on utilitarianism, but I don't think he's the one who used that phrase.

J: Friedrich Nietzsche – He's more into existentialism and the will to power, not really about natural rights in the same way.

Putting it together, the phrase 'nonsense on stilts' is often attributed to Jeremy Bentham, who was a critic of natural rights. He believed that natural rights were a fiction or a baseless idea, hence his strong criticism. So the answer should be H.

The answer is H: Jeremy Bentham.
