Okay, so I have this question about why the cores of terrestrial planets are mostly made of metal. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember from my classes that the Earth and other terrestrial planets have a core, mantle, and crust. The core is the innermost part and is usually composed of metals like iron and nickel. But why is that the case?

Looking at the options:

Option A says radioactivity created metals in the core. I'm not too sure about this. Radioactivity can generate heat, but does it create metals? I think radioactivity might contribute to the heat in the core but doesn't directly form the metals themselves. So probably not A.

Option B suggests metals were attracted to the gravitational center. Well, gravity does play a role in planetary formation. During accretion, denser materials like metals would settle towards the center because they're heavier. But is that the main reason? I think it's part of it, but maybe there's a better explanation.

Option C mentions the magnetic field moving metals. I know that the Earth's magnetic field is generated by the movement of molten metals in the core, but does the magnetic field cause the metals to migrate there in the first place? That seems unlikely. The magnetic field is a result, not the cause.

Option D is about aliens positioning metals. That's definitely not a scientific explanation. So D is out of the question.

Option E says the atmosphere's pressure pushed metals to the center. Wait, the planet's atmosphere isn't that dense or heavy. The pressure inside the planet is much higher, but does the atmosphere have enough pressure to push metals? I don't think so. So E is probably wrong.

Option F claims the whole planet is mostly metal. That's not true because the crust and mantle are mostly silicates, with the core being the metal part. So F is incorrect.

Option G suggests lighter elements floated up, leaving metals in the core. Oh, this makes sense. When the planet formed, the heavier materials like metals sank to the center, while lighter materials like silicates and rocks rose to the surface. So G seems like a good candidate.

Option H says rotation flung heavier elements to the core. I don't remember planetary rotation causing that. Maybe during formation, but I think gravity is the main factor, not rotation. So H might not be right.

Option I talks about differentiation when interiors were molten. Differentiation is the process where different materials separate based on density. If the interior was molten, heavier metals would indeed sink to the core. This sounds plausible, but I'm not sure how it differs from G. G is about lighter elements floating up, which is a form of differentiation. Maybe I is also correct, but I need to think more.

Option J says metals condensed first in the nebula and rocks accreted around them. I remember that in the solar nebula, heavier elements like metals condensed into solid grains first because they could cool down more quickly. As the nebula started to form planets, these metal grains would be in the center, and lighter materials like rocks and silicates would accrete around them. That makes sense too. So J is another strong option.

Wait, so both G and J seem possible. Let me clarify. G is about lighter elements floating, which is a result of differentiation due to gravity. J is about the order of condensation in the nebula. Which one is the main reason the core is metal?

I think the core's metal composition is due to the sequence of events during planetary formation. The initial nebula had materials that condensed in a certain orderâ€”metals first because they form at higher temperatures. Then, as the planet accreted material, the heavier metals were pulled towards the center by gravity, while lighter materials rose or formed the outer layers. So J explains the initial arrangement, and G explains the differentiation during accretion.

But the question is about why the cores contain mostly metal. So the main reason is that during planetary formation, as the material accreted, the heavier metals sank to the center. This is part of the differentiation process. So both G and I and J are related, but I think J is more about the initial nebular condensation, while G is about the differentiation during planet formation.

Wait, no. Option I says metals differentiated during a molten time. That would be part of the differentiation process. So I'm a bit confused between G, I, and J.

Let me think again. The core is metal because during the formation of the planet, the materials separated. The heavier, denser materials like metals sank to the center, while lighter materials like silicates formed the mantle and crust. This is due to the process of planetary differentiation, which is driven by gravity and the melting of materials.

So G says lighter elements floated up, leaving metals in the core. That's correct because it's about density-driven separation.

Option J is about the order of condensation in the nebula. While it's true that metals condensed first, it's more about the initial state before the planet formed. The actual concentration of metals in the core is due to the differentiation during accretion, not just the order of condensation.

Therefore, the correct answer should be G: lighter elements floated to the surface, leaving metals in the core.
</think>

The cores of terrestrial planets are mostly metal because during planetary formation, lighter elements and materials rose to the surface, leaving the heavier metals in the core. This process, known as differentiation, is driven by the density differences between materials and the gravitational sorting during the accretion phase of planet formation.
