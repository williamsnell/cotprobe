Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about ancient South American civilizations. The question is asking for the blank parts: which civilization developed one of the earliest kingdoms in South America and when did it reach its height. The options are from A to I, each pairing a culture with a specific year.

First, I need to recall what I know about these ancient South American cultures. I remember that the Inca Empire was one of the largest and most well-known, but I think they were more prominent in the later periods, maybe around the 15th century, so AD 200 seems too early for them. That might be too early for the Inca, so maybe option A is not correct.

The Moche are another option. They were an Andean civilization known for their pottery and irrigation systems. I think they flourished around the first centuries AD, so around AD 400 could make sense. Option B is Moche and AD 400.

The Olmec are an ancient Mesoamerican culture, not South American. They were in what's now Mexico and Guatemala, so option C is probably not the answer since the question is about South America.

The Maya also come from Mesoamerica, so option D is not correct either. They were around in the classic period from about AD 250 to 900, but again, not in South America.

E is Zapotec, another Mesoamerican group, so not relevant here. Option F is Chavin, which I recall was a pre-Columbian civilization in the Andes. They existed around 900 BC to AD 200. So their height might have been around AD 200, but wait, the question says the height was around the given year. If Chavin's peak was around AD 200, that would fit, but I thought Chavin was earlier than the others. However, I'm not sure if they were one of the earliest kingdoms or if they were even in South America. Wait, I think Chavin is in the Andes, so that's South America, but I'm a bit confused about their timeline.

Option G is Wari. The Wari Empire was a pre-Columbian civilization in the Andes, in present-day Peru. I think they flourished around the 6th to 10th centuries AD, so maybe around AD 600? But option F is Chavin at AD 600, and G is Wari at AD 100. Wait, that doesn't align. Maybe I'm mixing up the dates. I think the Wari Empire was after the Chavin, so perhaps their peak was around AD 600 or later. If option F is Chavin at AD 600, that might not fit because I thought Chavin was earlier, maybe around 900 BC to AD 200, so their height was earlier, perhaps around AD 200.

Option H is Aztec, which was a later empire in Mexico, so not South America, and their peak was around the 14th to 16th centuries, so AD 200 is way too early. Option I is Toltec, another Mesoamerican group, so not relevant.

So focusing on South American options: Moche (B), Chavin (F), Wari (G). The question is about the earliest kingdom. I think Chavin is considered one of the earliest in the Andes, possibly around 900 BC to AD 200, so their height might have been around AD 200. But option F says AD 600, which might not be right. Alternatively, the Moche were around AD 400, and the Wari around AD 100. Wait, that doesn't make sense because AD 100 is earlier than AD 400. So if the question is about the earliest kingdom, the Wari at AD 100 might be too early, but I'm not sure if they were established that early.

Alternatively, the Moche were around the first centuries AD, so AD 400 could be their peak. The Wari came later, perhaps in the 7th century. So if the question is about the earliest, perhaps the Moche are the answer. Alternatively, the Chavin might have been earlier than the Moche.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to list the timelines:

- Chavin: around 900 BC to AD 200. So their height might have been around 250 BC to AD 200, peaking around AD 200.

- Moche: flourished around AD 100 to 700, with their height around AD 400.

- Wari: around 600 to 1000 AD, peaking around AD 700 or so.

So if the question is about the earliest kingdom, Chavin might be the first, but their height was around AD 200, which is option F. However, the question says "one of the earliest kingdoms," so Chavin could be the earliest. But in the options, F is Chavin at AD 600, which doesn't make sense because their peak was earlier. So perhaps the correct pairing is F: Chavin; AD 600. But that seems off because I think Chavin's peak was before AD 200.

Alternatively, maybe the Wari are considered one of the earliest, but they came after Chavin. So perhaps the correct answer is F: Chavin at AD 600, but that doesn't fit because their peak was earlier.

Wait, perhaps the options have the correct pairings. So looking at option F: Chavin; AD 600. But if Chavin's height was around AD 200, then AD 600 is too late, so that's not correct. Similarly, option G is Wari at AD 100, but Wari's peak was around AD 600-700, so that's also off.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the dates. Let me think again. The Moche were around AD 100-700, so their height around AD 400 makes sense. So option B: Moche; AD 400. That seems plausible.

Alternatively, the Wari were around AD 600-1000, so their peak around AD 600 would fit option F if it were Wari at AD 600, but option F is Chavin at AD 600, which is incorrect.

So perhaps the correct answer is B: Moche; AD 400.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Another thought: the Chav√≠n culture is considered the first major civilization in the Andes, emerging around 900 BC, but their decline was around AD 200. So their height was around 500 BC to AD 200. So the height was around AD 200, but the option for Chavin is AD 600, which is incorrect. Therefore, the correct pairing would be Chavin and AD 200, but that's not an option. The closest is F: Chavin; AD 600, which is wrong.

So perhaps the answer is B: Moche; AD 400, as they were an early kingdom in the region, and their height around AD 400 fits.

The question asks for the civilization that developed one of the earliest kingdoms in South America and the time it reached its height. Among the options, the Moche (option B) is the most plausible answer. The Moche civilization flourished in the Andes and reached its height around AD 400, making option B the correct choice.

Answer: B
