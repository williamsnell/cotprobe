Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. The question is asking for the value of this infinite product multiplied by 2/π. The expression is 2/π times the product from k=1 to infinity of (2k)^2 divided by (2k-1)(2k+1). The options are given from A to J, and I need to choose the correct one.

Hmm, infinite products can be tricky, but maybe I can simplify this expression first. Let me write it out to see if I can recognize any patterns or known formulas. The product is over k starting from 1 to infinity, and each term is (2k)^2 divided by (2k-1)(2k+1). 

Wait, (2k)^2 is 4k², right? So each term is 4k² divided by (2k-1)(2k+1). Let me compute the denominator: (2k-1)(2k+1) is a difference of squares, so that's (2k)^2 - 1^2, which is 4k² - 1. So each term simplifies to 4k²/(4k² - 1). 

So the product becomes the product from k=1 to infinity of [4k²/(4k² - 1)]. That's the same as the product of [4k²/( (2k-1)(2k+1) )], which I already wrote. 

Now, the entire expression is 2/π multiplied by this product. So, 2/π times the product of [4k²/(4k² -1)] from k=1 to infinity.

I remember that Wallis' formula relates to products like this. Wallis' formula for π is an infinite product that converges to π/2. Let me recall: Wallis' formula says that π/2 is equal to the product from k=1 to infinity of (2k)^2/(2k-1)(2k+1). So that's exactly the product we're looking at here.

Wait, let me make sure. Wallis' formula is π/2 = product from k=1 to infinity of (2k)^2/( (2k -1)(2k +1) ). So that means our product is exactly π/2. 

So the product from k=1 to infinity of [ (2k)^2 / ( (2k -1)(2k +1) ) ] = π/2. 

But in our problem, the expression is 2/π multiplied by this product. So substituting in, we have 2/π * (π/2). 

Let me compute that: 2/π multiplied by π/2 equals (2 * π) / (π * 2) = 1. Because the 2's cancel, and the π's cancel. So the entire expression equals 1.

Wait, but let me double-check. Because I might have mixed up the formula. Let me write Wallis' formula again: π/2 = product_{k=1}^∞ [ (2k)^2 / ( (2k -1)(2k +1) ) ] = product_{k=1}^∞ [4k²/(4k² -1)]. 

So yes, that's correct. So our product is π/2. Then 2/π times π/2 is indeed 1. 

So the value of the given expression is 1. Looking back at the options, option F is 1.0. So the answer should be F.
