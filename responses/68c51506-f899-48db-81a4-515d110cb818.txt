<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out what r* is in the Vasicek model. The question gives me three P values with different parameters. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I remember that the Vasicek model is a type of interest rate model where the short rate follows a mean-reverting process. The formula for the price of a zero-coupon bond (which is what P(r,t,T) represents) is given by:

P(r, t, T) = (A(T - t) - B(T - t) * r) / a

Where A and B are functions of time and the parameters of the model, and a is the mean-reversion rate. But wait, I think the exact formula might vary based on the specific parameterization. Alternatively, another form I've seen is:

P(r, t, T) = e^(-r*(T-t) - (θ*σ²/(2a²))(1 - e^(-a(T-t))) + (r - θ) * (σ²/(2a))(e^(-a(T-t)) - 1)))

Hmm, but maybe I can approach this without knowing the exact formula but using the given data points.

I have three points:

1. P(0.04, 0, 2) = 0.9445
2. P(0.05, 1, 3) = 0.9321
3. P(r*, 2, 4) = 0.8960

I need to find r*. Since these are all P(r,t,T) values, each depends on r, t, and T. The Vasicek model suggests that the bond price is a linear function of the current short rate r. So perhaps P(r, t, T) = A(t,T) * e^(-r*(T-t)) + B(t,T) * r, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, it's a linear function in r, so P(r) = a*r + b.

Wait, more accurately, the Vasicek model's bond price is linear in r, so P(r, t, T) = A * r + B, where A and B are functions of time. So for each (t, T), P is a linear function of r.

So, for each given (t, T), we can write P(r, t, T) = m(t,T)*r + c(t,T), where m and c are the slope and intercept depending on t and T.

Let's see:

From the first data point: P(0.04, 0, 2) = 0.9445. So at t=0, T=2, the equation is:

0.9445 = m(0,2)*0.04 + c(0,2)

Similarly, the second point: P(0.05, 1, 3) = 0.9321. So t=1, T=3. Equation:

0.9321 = m(1,3)*0.05 + c(1,3)

Third point: P(r*, 2,4) =0.8960. So t=2, T=4. Equation:

0.8960 = m(2,4)*r* + c(2,4)

But I don't know m and c for these (t,T) pairs. However, perhaps I can find a relationship between these points. Since the model is Vasicek, the structure should be consistent across different t and T.

Wait, perhaps I can model the changes in the slope and intercept over time. Let me think about the structure.

In the Vasicek model, the bond price P(r, t, T) can be written as:

P(r, t, T) = A(t,T) * e^(-r*(T-t)) + B(t,T)

Where A(t,T) and B(t,T) are functions dependent on t and T but not on r. So, the price is affine in r.

But wait, another approach: the bond price satisfies the Vasicek pricing formula, which can be written as:

P(r, t, T) = (θ - r)/(a) * (1 - e^(-a(T-t))) + e^(-a(T-t)) )

Wait no, perhaps a better approach is to recall that in the Vasicek model, the bond price is given by:

P(r, t, T) = [ (θ / a) * (1 - e^(-a*(T-t))) ) - ( (σ² / (2a²) ) * (1 - e^(-a*(T-t)) ) + ( (T-t) * e^(-a*(T-t)) ) / a ) ) ] * e^(-r*(T-t)) 

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should look for a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the relationship between the given P values. Looking at the first two points, maybe I can find the parameters θ, a, and σ².

But wait, perhaps the key is that in the Vasicek model, the change in bond prices between different times can be expressed in terms of the short rate. Also, the model implies that the bond price's dependence on r is linear. So, perhaps I can set up equations based on the given P values.

Let me list the given points again:

1. At t=0, r=0.04, T=2: P=0.9445
2. At t=1, r=0.05, T=3: P=0.9321
3. At t=2, r=r*, T=4: P=0.8960

Wait, but in each case, the time t is when the short rate is r, and the bond pays at T. So each P(r, t, T) is the price at time t, given r, of a bond that pays 1 at T.

Now, since the Vasicek model implies that the bond price is linear in r, perhaps I can model P(r, t, T) = m(t,T) * r + c(t,T).

So for each (t, T), P is a linear function of r.

So for the first data point:

0.9445 = m(0,2) * 0.04 + c(0,2)  → equation 1

Second data point:

0.9321 = m(1,3) * 0.05 + c(1,3) → equation 2

Third data point:

0.8960 = m(2,4) * r* + c(2,4) → equation 3

Now, the challenge is to find m and c for each (t, T), but I don't know the model parameters (a, θ, σ). So perhaps I can find the relationship between m(0,2), m(1,3), and m(2,4).

Wait, perhaps I can consider the bond from t=0 to T=2, then from t=1 to T=3, and so on.

Wait, another approach: the Vasicek model assumes that the short rate evolves as dr = a(θ - r)dt + σ dW. The bond price P(r,t,T) satisfies the PDE: 0 = ∂P/∂t + (a(θ - r) ) ∂P/∂r + (1/2) σ² ∂²P/∂r² - r P.

But perhaps that's more complicated than needed.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that P(r, t, T) = e^{-a(T-t)} ( (θ - r)(1 - e^{-a(T-t)}) / a ) + e^{-r(T-t)} (something). I'm not sure.

Wait, I think the formula for P(r, t, T) in the Vasicek model is:

P(r, t, T) = ( (θ - r)(1 - e^{-a(T-t)}) / a ) * e^{-a(T-t)} + e^{-r(T-t)} * ( (θ σ²)/(2a²) ) (1 - e^{-2 a (T-t)}) / a )

Wait, that might not be correct. Alternatively, another form I've seen is:

P(r, t, T) = [ (θ - r) / a * (1 - e^{-a(T-t)}) ) + (σ²/(2a²))(1 - e^{-a(T-t)} - a(T-t)e^{-a(T-t)}) ) ] * e^{-a(T-t)}

Hmm, I'm getting stuck on the exact formula. Maybe a better approach is to look for the structure of P(r, t, T) as a linear function of r, so P(r) = A(t,T) * r + B(t,T).

Given that, perhaps I can write the equations as:

For (0,2): 0.9445 = A1 * 0.04 + B1
For (1,3): 0.9321 = A2 * 0.05 + B2
For (2,4): 0.8960 = A3 * r* + B3

But I don't know A1, B1, A2, B2, A3, B3.

But perhaps I can find a relationship between these A and B terms based on the model's parameters. Since the model is consistent, the structure should allow me to find A3 and B3 based on previous points.

Wait, perhaps the changes can be modeled. Let me think about the time differences.

Between t=0 and t=1, how does the bond price change? Similarly, from t=1 to t=2, and then from t=2 to t=3 (but T is increasing as well).

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the bond from T=2 to T=3, etc., but I'm not sure.

Wait, another idea: since P(r, t, T) is linear in r, then the change in P between two rates can be used to find the slope A.

For example, from the first data point, if I had another point with the same t and T but a different r, I could find A. But I only have one point per (t,T). Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I can look for the difference in P between different t and T. Let me consider the first two points.

At t=0, T=2: P=0.9445 when r=0.04.

At t=1, T=3: P=0.9321 when r=0.05.

Wait, perhaps I can model the change from t=0 to t=1, and T from 2 to 3. But I'm not sure how that affects the bond price.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think of the bond at t=1, T=3 as the bond at t=0, T=3, but with one year already passed. But I don't know P(0.05, 0,3) but I do know P(0.05,1,3)=0.9321.

Wait, maybe using the fact that P(r, t, T) = e^{-r*(T-t)} * P(r, t, T), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that the bond price at time t=1 for T=3 can be related to the bond price at t=0 for T=3 and T=4, but this is getting convoluted.

Wait, maybe I can model the bond price from t=0 to T=2, and then from T=2 to T=4, but I'm not sure.

Another approach: perhaps the Vasicek model allows us to express the bond price as a linear function of r, so P(r,t,T) = A(t,T) + B(t,T) * r.

If that's the case, then for each (t,T), we can find A and B.

So, for the first point: 0.9445 = A(0,2) + B(0,2)*0.04 → equation 1.

Second point: 0.9321 = A(1,3) + B(1,3)*0.05 → equation 2.

Third point: 0.8960 = A(2,4) + B(2,4)*r* → equation 3.

But we have three equations and six unknowns (A and B for each of the three (t,T) pairs). So I need more relations.

But perhaps the Vasicek model imposes some structure on A and B. For example, the bond price at a later time can be expressed in terms of the bond price at an earlier time. Also, note that from t=0 to t=1, the short rate changes from 0.04 to 0.05. Wait, but in the model, the short rate follows a certain process, but here we are given specific P values under specific r. Maybe that's not directly helpful.

Wait, perhaps I can model the change in the bond price as time progresses. For instance, the bond P(r, t, T) can be related to the bond P(r, t+Δt, T) via the short rate r at time t.

But without knowing the exact formula, this might be tricky.

Wait, perhaps I can assume that the slope B(t,T) is the same across different t and T? That might not be the case, but let's test it.

If B(0,2) = B(1,3) = B(2,4) = B, then from equation 1: 0.9445 = A1 + 0.04B.

From equation 2: 0.9321 = A2 + 0.05B.

From equation 3: 0.8960 = A3 + r*B.

But I don't know A1, A2, A3. However, perhaps the A terms can be related. For example, the bond at T=2 from t=0 is related to the bond at T=3 from t=1, etc.

Alternatively, perhaps the change in A can be linked through the time factor.

Wait, another thought: in the Vasicek model, the bond price P(r, t, T) is affine in r, and the coefficients A and B can be expressed in terms of the parameters a, θ, σ, and the time periods.

Let me try to recall the exact formula. The standard Vasicek formula for P(r, t, T) is:

P(r, t, T) = [ (θ - r)/(a) * (1 - e^{-a(T-t)}) ) + (σ²/(2a²))(1 - e^{-a(T-t)} - a(T-t)e^{-a(T-t)}) ) ] * e^{-a(T-t)}

Wait, no, that doesn't look quite right. Alternatively, another source says:

P(r, t, T) = e^{-a(T-t)} [ (θ - r)(1 - e^{-a(T-t)}) / a + σ²/(2a²) (1 - e^{-2a(T-t)}) / a ) ]

Hmm, I'm not confident about this. Alternatively, I think the correct formula is:

P(r, t, T) = ( (θ - r) / a * (1 - e^{-a(T-t)}) ) * e^{-a(T-t)} + (σ²/(2a²))(1 - e^{-a(T-t)} - a(T-t)e^{-a(T-t)} ) * e^{-a(T-t)}

Wait, maybe I should look up the Vasicek bond pricing formula. But since I can't do that right now, I'll proceed with another approach.

Let me assume that P(r, t, T) = A(t,T) * e^{-r(T-t)} + B(t,T).

Then, the price is linear in r. So for each (t, T), P = A e^{-rΔ} + B, where Δ = T-t.

Wait, but then how do A and B change with t and T? I think that in the Vasicek model, the coefficients A and B are functions of t and T, but not of r.

So perhaps I can write:

P(r, t, T) = A(t,T) * e^{-r(T-t)} + B(t,T).

Wait, but that would make P affine in e^{-rΔ}, which may not be correct because the Vasicek model's P is affine in r, not in e^{-rΔ}.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. The correct form is P(r, t, T) = A(t,T) + B(t,T) * r.

Yes, that's right. So P is linear in r, so we can write P = A + B*r.

So, for each (t,T), A and B are functions of t and T.

Given that, let's write the three equations again:

1. 0.9445 = A(0,2) + B(0,2)*0.04 → equation (1)
2. 0.9321 = A(1,3) + B(1,3)*0.05 → equation (2)
3. 0.8960 = A(2,4) + B(2,4)*r* → equation (3)

Now, I need to find r*, so I need to find A(2,4) and B(2,4).

But how can I relate A and B across different t and T?

Perhaps using the fact that the bond price at time t=1, T=3 can be related to the bond price at t=0, T=3. But I don't have that value. Alternatively, perhaps considering the bond at t=1, T=3 as the bond at t=0, T=2, but that's not directly helpful.

Wait, another approach: the Vasicek model has the property that the bond price at any time t can be written as P(r, t, T) = A(t,T) + B(t,T)*r.

The key is to find A(t,T) and B(t,T) based on the given data.

Wait, perhaps I can consider the bond at t=0, T=2 and t=1, T=3, and see how the coefficients change.

Let me denote Δ1 = 2 (T-t=2), Δ2=2 (T-t=2 again for t=1, T=3).

Wait, no, for t=0, T=2, Δ=2; for t=1, T=3, Δ=2 as well. So perhaps the Δ is the same, but the time t is different.

So, perhaps A and B have a structure that depends on t and Δ.

Wait, perhaps I can model the change in A and B from t=0 to t=1, keeping Δ=2.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the coefficients A(t, T) and B(t, T) can be expressed in terms of the model's parameters and the time periods.

Let me think about the Vasicek model's parameters. The model is usually defined with parameters a (mean reversion rate), θ (long-term mean), and σ (volatility).

The general formula for P(r, t, T) in the Vasicek model is:

P(r, t, T) = [ (θ - r)/(a) * (1 - e^{-a(T-t)}) ) ] * e^{-a(T-t)} + (σ²/(2a²)) [ (1 - e^{-a(T-t)}) - a(T-t)e^{-a(T-t)} ) ] * e^{-a(T-t)}

Wait, perhaps that's more accurate. So, P(r, t, T) can be written as:

P = e^{-aΔ} [ (θ - r)(1 - e^{-aΔ})/a + (σ²/(2a²))(1 - e^{-2aΔ} - aΔ e^{-aΔ}) ) ]

Where Δ = T - t.

So, let's denote Δ = T - t.

Then, P = e^{-aΔ} [ (θ - r)(1 - e^{-aΔ})/a + (σ²/(2a²))(1 - e^{-2aΔ} - aΔ e^{-aΔ}) ) ]

This can be rewritten as:

P = e^{-aΔ} [ (θ/(a) (1 - e^{-aΔ}) - r/a (1 - e^{-aΔ}) ) + (σ²/(2a²))(1 - e^{-2aΔ} - aΔ e^{-aΔ}) ) ]

Which simplifies to:

P = [ (θ/(a) (1 - e^{-aΔ}) - r/a (1 - e^{-aΔ}) ) + (σ²/(2a²))(1 - e^{-2aΔ} - aΔ e^{-aΔ}) ) ] * e^{-aΔ}

Wait, this seems a bit messy, but perhaps I can factor it differently.

Alternatively, perhaps the bond price can be written as:

P(r, t, T) = A + B*r, where:

A = e^{-aΔ} [ (θ (1 - e^{-aΔ}) )/a + (σ²/(2a²))(1 - e^{-2aΔ} - aΔ e^{-aΔ}) ) ]

B = -e^{-aΔ} [ (1 - e^{-aΔ}) / a ]

So, P = A + B*r.

Therefore, for each (t, T), A and B are functions of Δ = T - t, and the model parameters a, θ, σ.

Given that, perhaps I can write the equations using this structure.

So, for each data point:

1. At t=0, T=2: Δ=2
   P = 0.9445 = A1 + B1 * 0.04
   Where:
   A1 = e^{-2a} [ (θ (1 - e^{-2a}) )/a + (σ²/(2a²))(1 - e^{-4a} - 2a e^{-2a}) ) ]
   B1 = -e^{-2a} [ (1 - e^{-2a}) / a ]

2. At t=1, T=3: Δ=2
   P = 0.9321 = A2 + B2 * 0.05
   Where:
   A2 = e^{-2a} [ (θ (1 - e^{-2a}) )/a + (σ²/(2a²))(1 - e^{-4a} - 2a e^{-2a}) ) ]
   B2 = -e^{-2a} [ (1 - e^{-2a}) / a ]

Wait, that's interesting. Both A1 and A2 have the same Δ=2, so their A and B coefficients would be the same, right? Because Δ is T-t = 2 in both cases.

Wait, but t=0 and t=1 are different, but Δ is the same. Hmm, but in the model, the bond price at t=1, T=3 is not the same as at t=0, T=2 because the short rate has changed.

Wait, but in the Vasicek model, the bond price depends on the current short rate, which can change over time. So perhaps the A and B coefficients are the same for the same Δ, but the r changes.

Wait, but in this case, both data points have the same Δ=2. So A1 = A2 = A, and B1 = B2 = B.

So, from point 1 and 2, we can set up two equations:

0.9445 = A + B * 0.04 → equation (1)
0.9321 = A + B * 0.05 → equation (2)

Subtracting equation (1) from equation (2):

0.9321 - 0.9445 = (A + B*0.05) - (A + B*0.04)
-0.0124 = B*(0.05 - 0.04) = B*0.01
So, B = -0.0124 / 0.01 = -1.24

Then, substituting B back into equation (1):

0.9445 = A + (-1.24)*0.04 → 0.9445 = A - 0.0496 → A = 0.9445 + 0.0496 = 0.9941

So, for Δ=2, A=0.9941 and B=-1.24.

Now, moving to the third data point:

At t=2, T=4: Δ=2
P = 0.8960 = A3 + B3 * r*

But again, Δ=2, so A3 = A =0.9941 and B3 = B = -1.24.

So, 0.8960 = 0.9941 -1.24 * r* → 

Rearranging:

-1.24 * r* = 0.8960 - 0.9941 = -0.0981

So, r* = (-0.0981) / (-1.24) ≈ 0.0981 / 1.24 ≈ 0.0791, which is approximately 0.08.

Looking at the options, option E is 0.08.
</think>

To determine \( r^* \) in the Vasicek model, we analyze the given bond prices \( P(r, t, T) \) and use the fact that the bond price is linear in the short rate \( r \). The bond price can be expressed as \( P(r, t, T) = A(t, T) + B(t, T) \cdot r \), where \( A \) and \( B \) are functions of time but not of \( r \).

### Given Data:
1. \( P(0.04, 0, 2) = 0.9445 \)
2. \( P(0.05, 1, 3) = 0.9321 \)
3. \( P(r^*, 2, 4) = 0.8960 \)

### Step 1: Set Up Equations
For each data point, we write the bond price as a linear function of \( r \):
1. \( 0.9445 = A(0, 2) + B(0, 2) \cdot 0.04 \)
2. \( 0.9321 = A(1, 3) + B(1, 3) \cdot 0.05 \)
3. \( 0.8960 = A(2, 4) + B(2, 4) \cdot r^* \)

### Step 2: Identify Coefficients for \( \Delta = 2 \)
Notice that the time difference \( \Delta = T - t \) is 2 for both the first and second data points. Therefore, \( A \) and \( B \) are the same for both:
- \( A = A(0, 2) = A(1, 3) \)
- \( B = B(0, 2) = B(1, 3) \)

Using the first two equations:
1. \( 0.9445 = A + B \cdot 0.04 \)
2. \( 0.9321 = A + B \cdot 0.05 \)

Subtracting the first equation from the second:
\[
0.9321 - 0.9445 = (A + B \cdot 0.05) - (A + B \cdot 0.04)
\]
\[
-0.0124 = B \cdot (0.05 - 0.04) = B \cdot 0.01
\]
\[
B = \frac{-0.0124}{0.01} = -1.24
\]

Substitute \( B = -1.24 \) into the first equation:
\[
0.9445 = A + (-1.24) \cdot 0.04
\]
\[
0.9445 = A - 0.0496
\]
\[
A = 0.9445 + 0.0496 = 0.9941
\]

### Step 3: Solve for \( r^* \)
For the third data point with \( \Delta = 2 \):
\[
0.8960 = A + B \cdot r^*
\]
Substitute \( A = 0.9941 \) and \( B = -1.24 \):
\[
0.8960 = 0.9941 + (-1.24) \cdot r^*
\]
\[
-1.24 \cdot r^* = 0.8960 - 0.9941 = -0.0981
\]
\[
r^* = \frac{-0.0981}{-1.24} \approx 0.0791 \approx 0.08
\]

### Final Answer:
The value of \( r^* \) is approximately **0.08**, corresponding to option **E**.

**Answer: E**
