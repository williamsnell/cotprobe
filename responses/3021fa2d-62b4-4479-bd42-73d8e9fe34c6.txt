Answer:
    
<think>
Okay, so I have this problem about a six-pole generator, and I need to figure out two parts: part (a) and part (b). Let me start by understanding what's given and what I need to find.

First, the generator is a six-pole one. The shunt-field excitation is given as 4.5 amps at no load and 7.0 amps at rated load. The rated load is 200 amps. There are 750 shunt-field turns per pole. 

I think I remember that in a compound generator, the field excitation affects the voltage. Flat-compound operation means that the terminal voltage remains relatively constant regardless of the load. So, for part (a), I need to find how many series turns must be added using the short-shunt connection to achieve this.

Wait, short-shunt connection refers to the shunt field being connected across only the series field coils, so the shunt and series fields are in parallel. But in this case, since the question is about adding series turns, maybe I'm confusing something. Let me think.

In a short-shunt compound generator, the shunt field is connected across the series field, so the generated voltage E is given by E = I_shunt * R_shunt + I_series * R_series. But I'm not sure if that's the right approach.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the voltage regulation. At no load, the shunt current is 4.5 A, and at full load (200 A), it's 7.0 A. So, the change in shunt current is 7.0 - 4.5 = 2.5 A. 

But how does that relate to the series field? Oh right, in a compound generator, the series field current depends on the load current. For flat compound operation, the series field should compensate for the change in shunt field. So, the increase in shunt current should be offset by the series current.

Wait, in a shunt generator, the terminal voltage is E = V_shunt - I_shunt * R_shunt. But in a compound generator, especially a short-shunt, the voltage equation is E = V_shunt + V_series, where V_shunt is I_shunt * R_shunt, and V_series is I_series * R_series. No, wait, maybe I'm getting confused with the direction of the EMFs.

Wait, another approach: The generated EMF in a generator is E = Ia * R_a, where Ia is the armature current. But for a compound generator, it's E = I_shunt * R_shunt + I_series * R_series. Alternatively, perhaps E is the same as the rated voltage at both no load and full load, so flat voltage.

Wait, so the problem says that the generator requires 4.5 A shunt excitation at no load to give rated voltage, and 7.0 A at rated load of 200 A. So, the shunt current increases because the load is drawing more current, which would normally cause the terminal voltage to drop. But with a compound connection, we want to compensate for that drop.

In a short-shunt connection, the shunt field is connected across the series field, so the shunt field current I_shunt is the same as the series field current I_series plus the load current I_load. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the series field current is the same as the load current because the series field is in series with the load. So, I_series = I_load, which is 200 A.

But wait, the shunt field current at rated load is 7 A, which is higher than the 4.5 A at no load. The difference is 2.5 A. So, perhaps the series field needs to provide the additional 2.5 A to keep the voltage constant.

Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of the voltage drop. At no load, the shunt current is 4.5 A, so the voltage drop in the shunt field is I_shunt * R_shunt. At full load, the shunt current is 7 A, so the drop is higher. The series field would need to generate an additional voltage to compensate for this.

Alternatively, perhaps the series field should have a resistance such that the voltage drop in the series field at full load cancels the increase in shunt field drop.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the shunt field resistance first. The shunt field has 750 turns per pole, and six poles. So total shunt field turns would be 750 *6 = 4500 turns. But wait, no, wait: each pole has 750 turns, and for shunt field, the total inductance is per pole, but in a shunt connection, all poles are in parallel. So the total number of shunt turns would be 750 *6 = 4500. So the resistance R_shunt is (V_shunt)/(I_shunt), but I'm not sure what V_shunt is.

Wait, wait, maybe I should approach it differently. Let's consider that the generated voltage E is the same at both no load and full load, so E = V_shunt + V_series.

At no load, the current through the shunt is 4.5 A, and the series current is zero (since no load). So E = I_shunt * R_shunt + 0 = 4.5 R_shunt.

At full load, the current through the shunt is 7 A, and the series current is 200 A (since it's in series with the load). So E = 7 R_shunt + 200 R_series.

Since E is the same in both cases, we can set the two expressions equal:

4.5 R_shunt = 7 R_shunt + 200 R_series.

Wait, that would give a negative R_series, which doesn't make sense. So perhaps I got the equation wrong.

Wait, maybe the correct approach is that the generated EMF E is the same, so for no load:

E = I_shunt_no_load * R_shunt.

At full load:

E = I_shunt_load * R_shunt + I_series_load * R_series.

But I_series_load is the same as the load current, which is 200 A.

So, setting these equal:

I_shunt_no_load * R_shunt = I_shunt_load * R_shunt + I_series_load * R_series.

Plugging in the numbers:

4.5 R_shunt = 7 R_shunt + 200 R_series.

Wait, that gives 4.5 R_sh =7 R_sh + 200 R_s.

Hmm, that would imply 4.5 R_sh -7 R_sh = 200 R_s → -2.5 R_sh = 200 R_s → R_s = (-2.5 R_sh)/(200). Negative R_s? That can't be right. So perhaps I'm getting the signs wrong.

Wait, maybe the correct equation is E = I_shunt * R_shunt - I_series * R_series, because the series field could be opposing the shunt field. But that depends on the connection.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. In a short-shunt connection, the shunt field is connected across the series field. So the current through the shunt field is the sum of the series current and the load current. So I_shunt = I_series + I_load.

Wait, that makes sense because in a short-shunt connection, the shunt field is in parallel with the series field, so the total current is I_shunt = I_series + I_load.

So, rearranging that, I_series = I_shunt - I_load.

Wait, but wait: I_shunt is the current through the shunt field, which is the same as the current through the series field plus the load current. So I_shunt = I_series + I_load.

So, at no load, I_load = 0, so I_shunt = I_series. But in the problem, at no load, the shunt current is 4.5 A, and series current is zero (since no load), which contradicts this. Hmm, maybe I'm getting the configuration wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps in a short-shunt connection, the shunt field is connected across the series field, so the current through the shunt is the same as the current through the series field. That can't be right either.

Wait, perhaps I should refer to the correct formula. For a short-shunt compound generator, the terminal voltage E is given by E = I_shunt * R_shunt + I_series * R_series. But I'm not sure if that's the right formula.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me try another approach. The problem asks for the number of series turns to add. The shunt field has 750 turns per pole, so total shunt turns are 750 *6 =4500. The resistance of the shunt field is R_sh = V_shunt / I_shunt. Wait, but I don't know V_shunt. Alternatively, perhaps the generated EMF is the same as the terminal voltage at no load and rated load.

Wait, perhaps the generated EMF E is the same in both cases. At no load, the generated EMF E = I_shunt * R_shunt. At full load, the generated EMF E = I_shunt * R_shunt + I_series * R_series.

Wait, but that would mean E is higher at full load, which isn't the case. Because with load, the terminal voltage might drop, but in a compound generator, it's supposed to remain flat.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is E = I_shunt * R_shunt - I_series * R_series, because the series field opposes the shunt field. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the generated EMF is the same, so E = I_shunt * R_shunt + I_series * R_series at full load, and E = I_shunt_no_load * R_shunt at no load.

So, setting them equal:

I_shunt_no_load * R_shunt = I_shunt_load * R_shunt + I_series_load * R_series.

But I_series_load is the load current, which is 200 A.

Plugging the numbers:

4.5 R_sh =7 R_sh + 200 R_s.

So, 4.5 R_sh -7 R_sh = 200 R_s → -2.5 R_sh =200 R_s → R_s= (-2.5 R_sh)/(200).

Hmm, negative resistance? That doesn't make sense. I must have the signs wrong.

Wait, maybe the correct formula is E = I_shunt * R_shunt - I_series * R_series. So, at no load:

E =4.5 R_sh.

At full load:

E=7 R_sh -200 R_s.

Setting equal:

4.5 R_sh =7 R_sh -200 R_s → 4.5 R_sh -7 R_sh = -200 R_s → -2.5 R_sh = -200 R_s → R_s = (2.5 R_sh)/(200) = (0.0125) R_sh.

So R_s = 0.0125 R_sh.

But I don't know R_sh yet. Wait, R_sh is the shunt field resistance. The shunt field has 750 turns per pole, and six poles. So total turns N_sh =750 *6 =4500 turns.

Assuming the resistance per turn is r, R_sh = r * (N_sh / (6 * 2)) )? Wait, no, the shunt field is a set of windings in parallel. Each pole has 750 turns, so for six poles, the total number of parallel paths in the shunt field would be 6, each with 750 turns. So the shunt field resistance R_sh is (r * 750) / 6, where r is the resistance per turn.

Wait, but I don't know r. Alternatively, perhaps I can find R_sh from the given currents.

At no load, I_sh =4.5 A. So, assuming the generated EMF E is the same as the terminal voltage, which I'll call V. Then, V = I_sh * R_sh.

At full load, I_sh is 7 A, and the series current is 200 A. So, V = I_sh * R_sh - I_series * R_series.

Wait, but that might not be correct. Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is V = E - I_series * R_series, where E is the generated EMF. So, E = I_sh * R_sh + I_series * R_series.

Wait, I'm getting more confused. Let me try to model this properly.

In a generator, the generated EMF E is given by E = I * R + Ia * R_a, where I is the excitation current, R is the excitation resistance, and Ia is the armature current, R_a is the armature resistance. Wait, but maybe that's not the right approach.

Wait, perhaps I should model the generator as follows: the shunt and series fields are in parallel (short-shunt), so the total excitation current is I_sh = I_series + I_load. But I'm not sure.

Wait, I think I need to find R_sh first. Since I have two situations: no load and full load.

At no load, I_sh =4.5 A, and the generated EMF E is equal to the terminal voltage V. So, E = I_sh * R_sh.

At full load, the terminal voltage V is the same as E (since we want flat-compound), so V = E = I_sh_load * R_sh + I_series_load * R_series.

Wait, but I_series_load is the series current, which in a series connection would be equal to the load current, which is 200 A.

So,

E =4.5 R_sh,

E =7 R_sh + 200 R_series.

Setting equal:

4.5 R_sh =7 R_sh + 200 R_series → 4.5 R_sh -7 R_sh =200 R_series → -2.5 R_sh =200 R_series → R_series = (-2.5 R_sh)/200.

But that gives a negative R_series, which doesn't make sense. So perhaps I have the signs wrong. Maybe the correct equation is E = I_sh R_sh - I_series R_series.

So,

E =4.5 R_sh,

E=7 R_sh -200 R_series.

Setting equal:

4.5 R_sh =7 R_sh -200 R_series → 4.5 R_sh -7 R_sh = -200 R_series → -2.5 R_sh = -200 R_series → R_series = (2.5 R_sh)/(200) = 0.0125 R_sh.

So R_series = 0.0125 R_sh.

Now, I need to find R_sh.

The shunt field has 750 turns per pole, 6 poles. So total shunt turns N_sh =750 *6=4500 turns. But the shunt field is connected in parallel for each pole. So the resistance of the shunt field is R_sh = (resistance per turn) * (number of turns per pole) / number of poles. Wait, because each pole's shunt field is in parallel with the others.

Assuming the resistance per turn is r, then for each pole, the shunt resistance is r*(750). Since there are six poles in parallel, the total shunt resistance R_sh = (r *750)/6 = r * 125.

But I don't know r. Alternatively, perhaps I can find R_sh using the no-load condition.

Wait, at no load, the terminal voltage V is E = I_sh * R_sh =4.5 R_sh.

But I don't know V, so maybe I need another approach.

Wait, perhaps the change in shunt current from no load to full load is 7-4.5=2.5 A. So, the additional 2.5 A is due to the series current, which is 200 A. So, to compensate, the series field's voltage drop must be such that it offsets the increase in shunt drop.

Wait, but I'm not making progress. Maybe I should compute R_sh another way.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find R_sh using the fact that the generated EMF is the same at both conditions.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the voltage drop in the shunt field. The increase in shunt current from 4.5 A to 7 A would cause a higher voltage drop. The series field needs to add enough voltage to keep the terminal voltage the same.

So, the increase in shunt drop is (7 -4.5)*R_sh =2.5 R_sh. The series field needs to contribute 2.5 R_sh volts to offset this.

But the series field's voltage is I_series * R_series =200 R_series.

So, 200 R_series =2.5 R_sh → R_series = (2.5 R_sh)/200 =0.0125 R_sh.

So R_series =0.0125 R_sh.

Now, I need to find R_sh. The shunt field has 750 turns per pole, 6 poles. So, total shunt field inductance is 750 *6=4500 turns. But I don't know the resistance per turn.

Wait, perhaps I can find R_sh from the no-load condition. At no load, the terminal voltage V = E = I_sh * R_sh =4.5 R_sh.

But I don't know V. Wait, but maybe the rated voltage is the same at both no load and full load, so V is the same in both cases.

But without knowing V, I can't proceed numerically. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I can express R_series in terms of R_sh and then find the number of series turns needed.

The series field has a certain number of turns per pole, say N_s. The total series turns are 6*N_s. The resistance R_series is given by R_series = (resistance per turn) * (6 N_s) / (parallel paths). Wait, but in a generator, the series field is a single path, so the total resistance R_series = r * (6 N_s), where r is resistance per turn.

But I don't know r. Alternatively, perhaps I can find R_series in terms of R_sh and then find N_s.

We have R_series = 0.0125 R_sh.

But R_sh is the shunt field resistance. The shunt field has 750 turns per pole, 6 poles. So, R_sh = (r *750)/6 = r*125.

Similarly, R_series = r_s *6 N_s, where r_s is the resistance per turn for series field.

Assuming the same wire is used for both shunt and series fields, r_s = r.

So R_series = r *6 N_s.

But R_series =0.0125 R_sh =0.0125 * r*125 =1.5625 r.

So,

r*6 N_s =1.5625 r → 6 N_s =1.5625 → N_s=1.5625 /6 ≈0.2604 turns per pole.

Wait, that can't be right. I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps R_sh is calculated differently. Let me think again.

Each pole has 750 turns in shunt. The shunt field is connected in parallel across all six poles, so the total number of turns in parallel is 750 *6=4500 turns. But each turn has a resistance r. So the total resistance R_sh is (r *750) /6 = r*(750/6) =r*125.

Yes, that's correct.

Now, R_series =0.0125 R_sh =0.0125 *125 r =1.5625 r.

But R_series is also equal to (r * N_s *6) /1, since the series field is a single series path (6 poles in series, so total turns 6 N_s per phase? No, wait, in the series field, each pole has N_s turns, and all are connected in series, so total turns for series is N_s *6. So R_series = r*(N_s *6).

So,

r*(6 N_s) =1.5625 r → 6 N_s =1.5625 → N_s=1.5625 /6 ≈0.2604.

Wait, that gives a fractional turn per pole, which doesn't make sense. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Alternatively, maybe I should approach part (a) by considering that the series resistance R_series must be such that the voltage drop it provides cancels the increase in shunt voltage drop. So, the increase in shunt current is 2.5 A, so the increase in shunt voltage drop is 2.5 R_sh. The series field must provide a counter voltage of 2.5 R_sh, so I_series * R_series =2.5 R_sh.

I_series is the load current, which is 200 A.

So,

200 R_series =2.5 R_sh → R_series = (2.5/200) R_sh =0.0125 R_sh.

Same as before.

Now, R_sh is (r *750)/6 =r*125.

R_series is r*(6 N_s).

So,

r*(6 N_s) =0.0125 * r *125 → 6 N_s =0.0125 *125 → 6 N_s =1.5625 → N_s=1.5625 /6 ≈0.2604 turns per pole.

Wait, that can't be. So perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the resistance per turn is different for series and shunt fields. Or perhaps the approach is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps I should find the value of R_series in terms of R_sh and then find the number of series turns.

Wait, maybe I should find R_sh first. Let's see, the generated EMF E is the same at both no load and full load.

At no load: E = I_sh_no * R_sh.

At full load: E = I_sh_full * R_sh + I_series * R_series.

So,

I_sh_no * R_sh = I_sh_full * R_sh + I_series * R_series.

Rearranged:

I_series * R_series = (I_sh_no - I_sh_full) * R_sh.

Plugging in the numbers:

200 R_series = (4.5 -7) * R_sh → 200 R_series = (-2.5) R_sh → R_series = (-2.5 R_sh)/200 = -0.0125 R_sh.

But negative R_series doesn't make sense, so perhaps I should take the absolute value.

So, R_series =0.0125 R_sh.

Now, R_sh is (r *750)/6 =r*125.

So,

R_series =0.0125 *125 r =1.5625 r.

But R_series is also r_s *6 N_s, where r_s is the resistance per turn for series field. Assuming r_s =r (same wire), then:

r *6 N_s =1.5625 r → 6 N_s=1.5625 → N_s=1.5625 /6 ≈0.2604 turns per pole.

This is impossible because you can't have a fraction of a turn. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the voltage regulation. The drop in voltage in the shunt field is what's causing the need for the series field to compensate. So, the series field's voltage drop must equal the increase in shunt voltage drop.

So, the increase in shunt current is 7-4.5=2.5 A. So, the increase in shunt voltage drop is 2.5 R_sh. The series field must provide a drop of 2.5 R_sh in the opposite direction, so that the total voltage remains the same.

So, I_series * R_series =2.5 R_sh.

I_series is 200 A.

So,

200 R_series =2.5 R_sh → R_series = (2.5/200) R_sh =0.0125 R_sh.

Again, same result.

Now, R_sh is (r *750)/6 =r*125.

So,

R_series =0.0125 *125 r =1.5625 r.

But R_series is also r *6 N_s (since series field has 6 N_s turns in series).

So,

r *6 N_s =1.5625 r → 6 N_s =1.5625 → N_s=0.2604.

This still doesn't make sense. Maybe I'm missing a factor somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the resistance per turn for the series field is different. Let me think: the shunt field has 750 turns per pole, and the series field has N_s turns per pole. The resistance per turn depends on the length and cross-sectional area of the wire. Assuming the same wire is used, then resistance per turn r is the same for both fields.

Alternatively, perhaps the series field has a different number of conductors, so each turn has a different resistance. But that complicates things.

Alternatively, perhaps I should find the total resistance R_series in terms of R_sh, then find the number of turns.

R_series =0.0125 R_sh.

R_sh = (r *750)/6 =125 r.

So,

R_series =0.0125 *125 r =1.5625 r.

But R_series is also (r *6 N_s). So,

r *6 N_s =1.5625 r → 6 N_s=1.5625 → N_s=1.5625/6 ≈0.2604.

Hmm, this isn't working. Maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me try another way.

Perhaps I should find the ratio of R_series to R_sh.

From earlier, R_series =0.0125 R_sh.

So, R_series/R_sh =0.0125.

Now, the series field has 6*N_s turns, each with resistance r, so R_series =r *6 N_s.

The shunt field has 6*750 turns in parallel, so R_sh = (r *750)/6 =125 r.

So,

R_series =0.0125 *125 r =1.5625 r.

But R_series =r *6 N_s → 6 N_s =1.5625 → N_s=0.2604.

This leads to the same problem.

Wait, perhaps the approach is incorrect. Maybe I should think about the voltage compensation. The series field needs to create a voltage equal to the increase in shunt voltage.

The increase in shunt current is 2.5 A, so the increase in voltage drop is 2.5 R_sh. The series field must supply a voltage of 2.5 R_sh to compensate.

So, I_series * R_series =2.5 R_sh.

I_series is 200 A.

So,

200 R_series =2.5 R_sh → R_series = (2.5/200) R_sh =0.0125 R_sh.

Again, same equation.

Now, R_sh = (r *750)/6= 125 r.

R_series =0.0125 *125 r =1.5625 r.

But R_series is also r *6 N_s → 6 N_s =1.5625 → N_s=0.2604.

This is impossible. Therefore, perhaps the initial approach is wrong.

Alternative approach: Let's compute R_sh using the no-load condition.

At no load, V = E = I_sh * R_sh =4.5 R_sh.

At full load, V = E = I_sh_full * R_sh + I_series * R_series.

So,

4.5 R_sh =7 R_sh + 200 R_series → 4.5 R_sh -7 R_sh =200 R_series → -2.5 R_sh =200 R_series → R_series= (-2.5/200) R_sh= -0.0125 R_sh.

Negative R_series doesn't make sense. So perhaps I have the equation wrong.

Maybe the correct equation is E = I_sh * R_sh - I_series * R_series.

So,

4.5 R_sh =7 R_sh -200 R_series →4.5 R_sh -7 R_sh= -200 R_series →-2.5 R_sh =-200 R_series → R_series= (2.5 R_sh)/200=0.0125 R_sh.

So, R_series=0.0125 R_sh.

Now, R_sh is (r*750)/6=125 r.

Thus, R_series=0.0125 *125 r=1.5625 r.

But R_series is also r *6 N_s →6 N_s=1.5625 →N_s=0.2604.

Again, same issue.

Wait, maybe I should consider that the series field is connected in series with the load, so the current through the series field is the same as the load current, 200 A. So, the voltage drop in the series field is 200 R_series.

The increase in shunt voltage drop is (7-4.5) R_sh=2.5 R_sh.

To keep E the same, the series drop must be equal to the increase in shunt drop.

So,

200 R_series=2.5 R_sh → R_series= (2.5/200) R_sh=0.0125 R_sh.

Same as before.

So, R_series=0.0125 R_sh.

But R_sh=125 r.

So, R_series=1.5625 r.

But R_series= r*(6 N_s).

So,

6 N_s=1.5625 → N_s=1.5625/6≈0.2604.

Hmm, this suggests that the series field needs about 0.26 turns per pole, which is impossible. So perhaps I'm missing something in the setup.

Wait, perhaps the series field is connected in parallel, not in series. No, that can't be. In a short-shunt connection, the shunt field is connected across the series field, so the series field is in series with the load.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is that the series field current is I_series = I_shunt - I_load.

Wait, that might make more sense. So, I_series = I_shunt_load - I_load.

So, at full load, I_series=7 -200= -193 A. That can't be right because current can't be negative.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the current in the shunt and series fields. In a short-shunt connection, the shunt field current is the sum of the series field current and the load current.

So,

I_shunt =I_series + I_load.

So, at no load, I_load=0 → I_shunt=I_series.

At full load, I_shunt=7 A, I_series=7 -200 =-193 A. Which is impossible, so perhaps this approach is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is I_shunt = I_series - I_load. But that would give I_series=I_shunt + I_load.

At full load, I_series=7 +200=207 A, which seems high.

I'm getting stuck. Let me try to look for another approach.

Perhaps the key is to find the required series resistance so that the voltage drop in the series field at full load compensates for the increase in shunt field drop.

The increase in shunt drop is (7-4.5) R_sh=2.5 R_sh.

The series drop should be equal to this, so 200 R_series=2.5 R_sh → R_series=2.5 R_sh /200=0.0125 R_sh.

Now, R_sh is the shunt field resistance.

The shunt field has 750 turns per pole, 6 poles. So, total shunt turns N_sh=750*6=4500 turns.

Assuming each turn has resistance r, the shunt field resistance R_sh is (r *750)/6=125 r.

So,

R_series=0.0125 *125 r=1.5625 r.

But R_series is the resistance of the series field. The series field has N_s turns per pole, 6 poles in series, so total series turns=6 N_s.

Thus, R_series= r *6 N_s.

Setting equal:

r *6 N_s=1.5625 r →6 N_s=1.5625 →N_s=0.2604.

This is impossible. Therefore, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption.

Wait, perhaps the series field is connected in parallel with the shunt field, but that's a long-shunt connection, not short-shunt. The question specifies short-shunt, so I think that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the series field is in series with the load, so the current through the series field is the same as the load current, 200 A.

So, the voltage drop in the series field is 200 R_series.

To keep the terminal voltage constant, this drop must be equal to the increase in shunt field drop, which is (7-4.5) R_sh=2.5 R_sh.

So,

200 R_series=2.5 R_sh → R_series= (2.5/200) R_sh=0.0125 R_sh.

Now, R_sh is the shunt resistance.

R_sh= (r *750)/6=125 r.

So,

R_series=0.0125 *125 r=1.5625 r.

But R_series is the resistance of the series field, which has 6 N_s turns in series (since each pole has N_s turns and they're connected in series). So,

R_series= r *6 N_s.

Setting equal:

r *6 N_s=1.5625 r →6 N_s=1.5625 →N_s=0.2604.

Again, impossible. So perhaps I'm missing a step. Maybe the series field is connected differently.

Wait, perhaps the generated EMF is the same in both cases, so E=I_sh_no * R_sh=I_sh_full * R_sh + I_series * R_series.

So,

4.5 R_sh=7 R_sh +200 R_series →4.5 R_sh -7 R_sh=200 R_series →-2.5 R_sh=200 R_series → R_series= (-2.5 R_sh)/200= -0.0125 R_sh.

Negative R_series doesn't make sense. So perhaps I have to take the absolute value, R_series=0.0125 R_sh.

Now, R_sh=125 r.

So R_series=0.0125 *125 r=1.5625 r.

But R_series= r *6 N_s →6 N_s=1.5625 →N_s=0.2604.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the answer is that no series turns need to be added, but that's not one of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the series field has a certain number of turns, and the required resistance is such that R_series=0.0125 R_sh.

So, R_series=0.0125 *125 r=1.5625 r.

But I don't know r. Alternatively, perhaps I can find r from the shunt field's resistance.

Wait, the shunt field has 750 turns per pole, 6 poles, so 4500 turns total. But they're connected in parallel, so the resistance is R_sh= (r *750)/6=125 r.

But I don't know r, the resistance per turn. How can I find r?

Wait, perhaps the resistance per turn can be found from the shunt field's current. At no load, I_sh=4.5 A.

But without knowing the voltage, I can't find r.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the generated EMF E is the same at both no load and full load. So,

E = I_sh_no * R_sh =4.5 R_sh.

E = I_sh_full * R_sh + I_series * R_series=7 R_sh +200 R_series.

Setting equal:

4.5 R_sh=7 R_sh +200 R_series →-2.5 R_sh=200 R_series → R_series= (-2.5/200) R_sh= -0.0125 R_sh.

But R_series can't be negative, so perhaps I should take the absolute value, R_series=0.0125 R_sh.

Now, R_series=0.0125 R_sh.

But R_sh=125 r → R_series=0.0125 *125 r=1.5625 r.

So, R_series=1.5625 r.

But R_series is also r *6 N_s →6 N_s=1.5625 →N_s=0.2604.

This doesn't make sense, so perhaps I'm missing a step. Maybe I should find the number of turns needed to achieve the required R_series.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the total resistance needed for the series field and then find the number of turns.

R_series=0.0125 R_sh=0.0125*(125 r)=1.5625 r.

But I don't know r. How can I proceed?

Wait, maybe the problem expects us to find the number of series turns per pole, given that the series resistance is R_series= (2.5 R_sh)/200=0.0125 R_sh.

But without knowing R_sh, perhaps I'm missing a way to express the number of turns.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of series turns is given by the required R_series.

Wait, perhaps I should move to part (b) first, but I'm not sure. Let's see.

Part (b) says that 12 turns per pole are added, with a resistance of 0.005 ohm per pole. Then, what shunt resistance is needed.

But without solving part (a), I can't proceed. So I'll try to find another approach.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the voltage drop in the series field must be equal to the increase in shunt voltage drop. So,

I_series * R_series = (I_sh_full - I_sh_no) * R_sh.

I_series is the load current, 200 A.

So,

200 R_series = (7 -4.5) R_sh →200 R_series=2.5 R_sh → R_series= (2.5/200) R_sh=0.0125 R_sh.

Same as before.

Now, R_sh is the shunt field resistance, which is R_sh= (r *750)/6=125 r.

So,

R_series=0.0125 *125 r=1.5625 r.

But R_series is also r *6 N_s →6 N_s=1.5625 → N_s=0.2604.

This can't be. So perhaps I'm missing a factor of 6 somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the series field has 6 times the number of turns per pole. Or perhaps the calculation is different.

Alternatively, perhaps the series field has 6 N_s turns in total, not per pole.

Wait, no, each pole has N_s turns, so total series turns are 6 N_s.

So,

R_series= r*(6 N_s).

So,

r*(6 N_s)=0.0125*(r*125) →6 N_s=0.0125 *125=1.5625 →N_s=1.5625/6≈0.2604.

Still the same issue.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects us to round to the nearest whole number. 0.26 turns is about 0.3, but that's not an option. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to find the series resistance R_series that makes the voltage drop in the series field equal to the increase in shunt voltage drop.

So,

R_series= (ΔV_shunt)/I_series= (2.5 R_sh)/200=0.0125 R_sh.

Now, R_sh= (r *750)/6=125 r.

So,

R_series=0.0125 *125 r=1.5625 r.

But R_series is also r *6 N_s →6 N_s=1.5625 →N_s=0.2604.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the series field's resistance is per pole, not total. Let me read the question again.

In part (b), it says 12 turns per pole are added, having a resistance of 0.005 ohm per pole. So, perhaps in part (a), the series field's resistance is per pole as well.

So, if each pole has N_s turns, then the resistance per pole is R_s_pole= r *N_s.

But earlier, I considered R_series as the total series resistance, which would be 6 times per pole resistance.

Wait, perhaps I should model R_series as the per-pole resistance multiplied by 6.

Wait, no. If each pole's series field has N_s turns, then the total series resistance is R_series= r *N_s /6, because the series field is connected in parallel across all poles. Wait, no, that can't be. Because in a generator, the series field is in series with the load, so all poles' series fields are connected in series, not parallel.

Wait, no, in a compound generator, the series field is connected in series with the armature, so all poles' series fields are in series, meaning the total turns are additive. So, total series turns would be 6*N_s, and the resistance R_series= r*(6 N_s).

So, R_series=6 r N_s.

But earlier, I have R_series=0.0125 R_sh=0.0125*(125 r)=1.5625 r.

So,

6 r N_s=1.5625 r →6 N_s=1.5625 →N_s=1.5625/6≈0.2604.

Same result.

This suggests that the number of turns per pole is about 0.26, which is impossible. Therefore, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the approach.

Alternative approach: Let's find the required series resistance R_series.

We have R_series=0.0125 R_sh.

R_sh is the shunt field resistance, which is (r *750)/6=125 r.

So, R_series=0.0125 *125 r=1.5625 r.

Now, R_series is also equal to (r *6 N_s). So,

r *6 N_s=1.5625 r →6 N_s=1.5625 →N_s=0.2604.

This is impossible. Therefore, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the turns and just find the resistance, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the number of turns needed to achieve the required R_series.

R_series=0.0125 R_sh.

But I don't know R_sh, but perhaps I can express it in terms of the given data.

Wait, perhaps R_sh can be found from the no-load condition. At no load, E=I_sh * R_sh=4.5 R_sh.

But E is the rated voltage, which I don't know. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I can find R_sh using the given data. Let's assume that the rated voltage is V.

At no load, V=4.5 R_sh.

At full load, V=7 R_sh +200 R_series.

Setting equal:

4.5 R_sh=7 R_sh +200 R_series →-2.5 R_sh=200 R_series →R_series= -0.0125 R_sh.

But since R_series can't be negative, perhaps I have the signs wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the correct equation is V=7 R_sh -200 R_series.

So,

4.5 R_sh=7 R_sh -200 R_series →-2.5 R_sh= -200 R_series → R_series= (2.5 R_sh)/200=0.0125 R_sh.

Now, R_series=0.0125 R_sh.

But R_sh=125 r → R_series=1.5625 r.

And R_series=6 r N_s →6 N_s=1.5625 →N_s=0.2604.

Same issue.

I'm stuck. Maybe I should look at the options given and see if any make sense.

Looking at the options for part (a), the possible answers are around 8.4, 9.4, 10.4, etc. So, the number of series turns per pole is likely around 8-10.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a factor of 6. Because earlier, N_s was 0.26 per pole, but perhaps the correct approach is to multiply by 6.

Wait, perhaps the series field has 6 times the number of turns per pole.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the series field needs to have a resistance R_series=0.0125 R_sh, and since R_sh=125 r, R_series=1.5625 r.

If r is the resistance per turn, then the number of turns N_s per pole would be N_s= R_series/(r *6).

Wait, because R_series= r*(6 N_s).

So,

N_s= R_series/(6 r)= (1.5625 r)/(6 r)=1.5625/6≈0.2604.

Again, same result.

I'm stuck. Maybe I should proceed to part (b) and see if that gives me any clues.

Part (b): If 12 turns per pole are added, having a resistance of 0.005 ohm per pole, what should be the resistance of a shunt across the series-field terminals?

Wait, adding 12 turns per pole in series would change the series field resistance. Wait, but the problem says 12 turns per pole are added, but I'm not sure if they're in series or parallel.

Wait, perhaps adding 12 turns per pole in series would increase the number of turns, thus decreasing the resistance. But the problem states that the added turns have a resistance of 0.005 ohm per pole.

Wait, perhaps the added turns are in parallel, reducing the resistance. Alternatively, perhaps they're additional series turns.

But I'm not sure. Let me think.

If 12 turns per pole are added to the series field, and each added turn has a resistance of 0.005 ohm per pole, then the total resistance of the added series field would be R_added=0.005 ohm per pole.

Wait, but I'm not sure how this affects the overall resistance.

Alternatively, perhaps the added series field has a resistance R_add, and we need to find a shunt resistor R_shunt to be connected across the series terminals to achieve flat-compound operation.

But I'm not making progress. Maybe I should consider that the problem expects me to calculate the required series resistance R_series for part (a) and then use that to find the number of turns.

But I'm stuck on part (a). Perhaps I should make an educated guess based on the options.

Looking at the options, the possible answers for part (a) are 8.4, 9.4, etc. So perhaps the correct answer is around 9.4, which is option D or H.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate using the given options.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to find the series resistance R_series= (ΔI_shunt * R_sh)/I_series= (2.5 R_sh)/200=0.0125 R_sh.

Now, R_sh= (r *750)/6=125 r.

So,

R_series=0.0125 *125 r=1.5625 r.

But R_series is the resistance of the series field, which has 6 N_s turns in series, so R_series= r *6 N_s.

Thus,

6 N_s=1.5625 →N_s≈0.26 turns per pole.

This is impossible, so perhaps the problem expects us to add turns in parallel, which would reduce the resistance.

Wait, perhaps the series field is connected in parallel, but that would change the configuration. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to add shunt turns to the series field.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to calculate the required series resistance and then find the number of turns needed to achieve that resistance.

But without knowing r, I can't proceed. So perhaps I should proceed differently.

Wait, perhaps the series field's resistance R_series can be found from the equation R_series=0.0125 R_sh.

And R_sh is the shunt resistance, which is (r *750)/6=125 r.

So,

R_series=0.0125 *125 r=1.5625 r.

But R_series is also equal to (r *6 N_s), so 6 N_s=1.5625 →N_s≈0.26 turns per pole.

This doesn't make sense, so perhaps I'm missing a key point.

Wait, perhaps the series field is connected in such a way that the total number of turns is the same as the shunt field. But that's just a guess.

Alternatively, perhaps the series field needs to have a resistance such that R_series= (I_sh_no - I_sh_full) * R_sh / I_series= (4.5-7)*R_sh /200= (-2.5 R_sh)/200= -0.0125 R_sh.

But negative resistance is impossible, so perhaps the correct R_series=0.0125 R_sh.

Thus, R_series=0.0125 R_sh=0.0125*(125 r)=1.5625 r.

But I don't know r, so perhaps the number of turns is 1.5625 r / (r *6)=1.5625/6≈0.26 turns per pole.

This seems impossible, so perhaps I'm making a mistake. Maybe the correct answer is option E: 10.4, 0.107 ohm, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should proceed by assuming that the series field needs to have a resistance of R_series=0.0125 R_sh=0.0125*(125 r)=1.5625 r.

But without knowing r, I can't find the number of turns. So perhaps the answer is that no series turns need to be added, but that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the total resistance of the series field if 12 turns per pole are added. Then, the resistance per pole for the added series is 0.005 ohm. So, total series resistance would be 0.005 ohm per pole *6 poles=0.03 ohm.

But I'm not sure how that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps the added series turns have a resistance of 0.005 ohm per pole, so total series resistance is 0.005 *6=0.03 ohm.

Then, the shunt resistance needed would be R_shunt= (something).

But I'm not making progress. Given the time I've spent, I'll have to make an educated guess. Looking at the options, the likely answer is E: 10.4, 0.107 ohm.

But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is H:9.4, 0.107 ohm.

Wait, let me think again. Maybe the series field needs to have a resistance R_series= (2.5 R_sh)/200=0.0125 R_sh.

R_sh=125 r.

So,

R_series=0.0125 *125 r=1.5625 r.

But R_series= r *6 N_s →6 N_s=1.5625 →N_s=0.26.

But this is impossible, so perhaps the problem expects us to add turns in parallel, which would decrease the resistance.

If I add turns in parallel, the resistance would be R_series= (r *6 N_s) in parallel with added turns.

But I'm not sure. Given the time I've spent, I'll have to proceed with the answer.
</think>

The problem involves a six-pole generator requiring shunt-field excitation to achieve flat-compound operation. For part (a), the goal is to determine the number of series turns to add using a short-shunt connection. The key steps involve calculating the resistance of the shunt field and the required series resistance to compensate for the voltage drop.

1. **Shunt Field Resistance**:  
   The shunt field has 750 turns per pole and 6 poles, giving a total of \( 750 \times 6 = 4500 \) turns. The resistance of the shunt field is \( R_{sh} = \frac{r \times 750}{6} = 125r \), where \( r \) is the resistance per turn.

2. **Series Resistance Calculation**:  
   The increase in shunt current from 4.5 A (no load) to 7 A (full load) results in an additional voltage drop of \( \Delta V = (7 - 4.5) \times R_{sh} = 2.5R_{sh} \). To maintain flat-compound operation, the series field must provide a counter voltage equal to this drop.  
   Using \( I_{series} = 200 \, \text{A} \), the series resistance is \( R_{series} = \frac{\Delta V}{I_{series}} = \frac{2.5R_{sh}}{200} = 0.0125R_{sh} \).

3. **Number of Series Turns**:  
   The series field resistance is also given by \( R_{series} = r \times 6N_s \), where \( N_s \) is the number of turns per pole. Substituting \( R_{series} = 0.0125R_{sh} = 0.0125 \times 125r = 1.5625r \), we solve for \( N_s \):  
   \[
   6N_s = 1.5625 \implies N_s = \frac{1.5625}{6} \approx 0.26 \, \text{turns per pole}.
   \]  
   This result is impractical, suggesting a potential error in the approach or assumptions.

4. **Options Analysis**:  
   Given the calculated inconsistency, the most plausible answer based on the options provided is **H: 9.4, 0.107 ohm**, as it aligns with typical values for such problems.

ANSWER: H
