Question:

Lucy Johnson earns $26,300 a year and supports her disabled husband and three children. Her husband does some work at home for which he earns $3,200 during the year. The Johnsons have itemized deductions amounting to $3,100 for the year. What is their federal income tax?

Options:

A: $5,228
B: $0 (because they fall below the tax threshold)
C: $2,650
D: $7,150
E: $6,300
F: $4,380
G: $3,400
H: $22,650
I: $3,950
J: $1,850

Okay, so I need to figure out how much tax the Johnsons have to pay. Let's see, Lucy earns $26,300 a year, and her husband makes $3,200 working at home. Their itemized deductions are $3,100. Hmm, I think I should start by adding up their incomes to get their total income before deductions.

So Lucy's income is $26,300, and her husband's is $3,200. Adding those together gives $26,300 + $3,200 = $29,500. That's their total income before any deductions.

Next, they have itemized deductions of $3,100. So I subtract that from their total income to find their taxable income. $29,500 - $3,100 = $26,400. Now I need to determine how much tax they owe on $26,400.

I remember that the U.S. federal income tax brackets are progressive, meaning different portions of their income are taxed at different rates. Let me try to recall the brackets. I think the brackets for the year in question (I'm assuming it's recent, like 2023) are something like:

- 10% on the first $11,000
- 12% on the next $9,300 (up to $20,300)
- 22% on the next $53,400 (up to $73,700)
- And so on, but since their taxable income is $26,400, I probably only need the first three brackets.

Wait, maybe I should double-check the exact brackets. Let me think: for single filers, the brackets are:

1. 10% up to $11,000
2. 12% from $11,001 to $20,300
3. 22% from $20,301 to $40,500

But wait, are the Johnsons filing jointly? Because if they're married, they should file jointly, which has higher brackets. Let me confirm. Yes, married couples filing jointly have higher limits.

So for joint filers in 2023, the brackets are:

1. 10% up to $22,000
2. 12% from $22,001 to $39,400
3. 22% from $39,401 to $80,300
4. 24% from $80,301 to $164,600
5. etc.

Wait, no, I think I might be mixing up the years. Let me think again. Maybe I should look up the exact 2023 joint brackets. But since I can't look it up, I'll proceed with what I remember.

Assuming the first bracket is 10% up to $22,000, the next is 12% up to $39,400, then 22% beyond that.

So their taxable income is $26,400. Let's break it down:

- The first $22,000 is taxed at 10%. So 10% of 22,000 is $2,200.
- The remaining income is $26,400 - $22,000 = $4,400.
- This $4,400 falls into the 12% bracket. So 12% of 4,400 is $528.

Adding those together: $2,200 + $528 = $2,728.

Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see $2,728 as an option. The options are A:5,228; B:0; C:2,650; D:7,150; E:6,300; F:4,380; G:3,400; H:22,650; I:3,950; J:1,850.

Hmm, so maybe I made a mistake. Let me check again.

Wait, maybe I confused the filing status. If they're married, their joint income is $26,400, but perhaps I should consider if they qualify for any standard deductions or if the itemized deductions are higher, but the question says they itemize, so I think I did that right.

Wait, another thought: Are they eligible for the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC)? Since Lucy is working and her husband is disabled, maybe they qualify. The EITC can significantly reduce their tax liability, or even make it zero.

I think the EITC is available to low- and moderate-income families, especially those with children. The Johnsons have three children, so that might make them eligible. Let me try to estimate the EITC they might get.

The EITC for 2023 for a married couple with three children would have a maximum credit based on their income. Since their income is around $26,400 after deductions, they might be eligible for a substantial credit, possibly around $3,000 or more. But I'm not exactly sure of the exact amount.

If I add the EITC to the tax calculation, it could reduce their tax liability to zero. For example, if their tax before EITC is $2,728 and they get a $2,728 EITC, their tax would be zero. Alternatively, the EITC could be higher than their tax liability, leading to a refund.

Looking back at the options, option B is $0. So if their tax is $2,728 and their EITC is $2,728 or more, they would owe nothing. That would make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the standard deduction for a married couple is higher than the itemized deductions. Wait, no, they itemized $3,100, which is more than the standard deduction, so they should stick with itemizing.

Wait, another angle: Maybe I miscalculated the tax brackets. Let me recalculate.

Taxable income: $26,400.

Joint filer brackets (for 2023):

- 10% on 0-22,000: 10% of 22,000 = $2,200.
- 12% on 22,001-39,400: $26,400 - $22,000 = $4,400 taxed at 12% = $528.
Total tax before credits: $2,200 + $528 = $2,728.

If the EITC brings this down to zero, then the answer would be B: $0.

But I'm not entirely sure about the EITC amount. Let me think about the EITC phase-out. For 2023, the maximum EITC for a married couple with three children is $3,800. So if their tax is $2,728 and they get the EITC, their tax would be $2,728 - $3,800 = negative, meaning they'd get a refund, but the question is about what they owe, so their tax would be $0.

Alternatively, perhaps they don't qualify for the EITC because their income is too high. Wait, the income limits for EITC in 2023 for a married couple with three kids is up to about $58,000. Since their income is $26,400, they definitely qualify.

So their tax would be $2,728 minus EITC. If the EITC is more than $2,728, their tax would be zero. So the answer is B: $0.

Wait, but I'm not certain about the EITC amount. Maybe I should check the phase-in rates. The EITC starts at a certain point and increases until a maximum. For a married couple with three kids, the maximum is $3,800 in 2023. The phase-out starts at about $58,000, so they're well below that.

So, their EITC would be $3,800, which is more than their tax liability. Therefore, their federal income tax would be $0.

The Johnsons' total income is $26,300 (Lucy) + $3,200 (her husband) = $29,500. After itemized deductions of $3,100, their taxable income is $26,400. Using the 2023 federal income tax brackets for joint filers, the first $22,000 is taxed at 10% ($2,200), and the remaining $4,400 is taxed at 12% ($528), totaling $2,728 in taxes. However, they likely qualify for the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), which for a married couple with three children is $3,800. Since the EITC exceeds their tax liability, their federal income tax is $0.

Answer: B
