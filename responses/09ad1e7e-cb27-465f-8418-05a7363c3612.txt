Okay, so I've got this question about a Wilson cloud chamber, and I'm a bit rusty on my thermodynamics, but let's try to work through it. Alright, the problem states that the cloud chamber is at 20°C, and they're causing condensation by expanding the gas adiabatically. The volume ratio is final over initial, which is 1.375. The specific heat ratio, gamma, is 1.41. I need to find the gas temperature after this expansion.

Hmm, adiabatic processes... I remember that in an adiabatic process, there's no heat exchange with the surroundings. So the first law of thermodynamics tells us that the change in internal energy is equal to the work done on the system. Oh right, and for an ideal gas undergoing an adiabatic process, the relation between temperature and volume is given by the formula:

T1 / T2 = (V2 / V1)^(γ - 1)

Wait, wait, actually, I should double-check that. I think it's T2 = T1 * (V1 / V2)^(γ - 1). Because when a gas expands adiabatically, it does work, so the temperature should drop. So yeah, since the volume increases, the temperature should decrease.

Given that, let's plug in the numbers. The initial temperature T1 is 20°C, which I need to convert to Kelvin for calculations. So T1 = 20 + 273.15 = 293.15 K.

The volume ratio V2/V1 is 1.375, so V1/V2 would be 1/1.375 ≈ 0.7273. The specific heat ratio γ is 1.41.

So substituting into the formula, T2 = T1 * (V1/V2)^(γ-1). Let's compute the exponent first: γ-1 = 0.41.

So (V1/V2) is about 0.7273. Raising that to the 0.41 power. Hmm, how do I calculate that? Maybe I can use logarithms. Let me think: ln(0.7273) is approximately ln(0.7) is about -0.3567, but more accurately, 0.7273 is around e^(-0.32). Let me check on calculator: ln(0.7273) ≈ -0.318. Multiply by 0.41: -0.318 * 0.41 ≈ -0.1304. Then exponentiate that: e^(-0.1304) ≈ 0.877.

So T2 ≈ 293.15 K * 0.877 ≈ 293.15 * 0.877. Let me compute that: 293 * 0.877. 300 *0.877 is 263.1, so subtract 7 *0.877=6.139, so 263.1 - 6.139=256.96 K. Approximately 257 K.

Now converting back to Celsius: 257 K minus 273.15 is about -16.15°C. Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see -16.15. The closest options are I: -15.8°C and J: -2.1°C. Hmm, maybe my calculation is a bit off because I approximated the exponent.

Wait, perhaps I should compute (0.7273)^0.41 more accurately. Let me try another approach. Let's compute ln(0.7273) more precisely. Let me use a calculator-style approach:

0.7273 = e^x, find x. Let's see, ln(0.7) is about -0.35667, ln(0.72) is about -0.3285, ln(0.73) is about -0.3148. 0.7273 is between 0.72 and 0.73, closer to 0.73. Let's estimate ln(0.7273) ≈ -0.318.

Then, (0.7273)^0.41 = e^(0.41 * ln(0.7273)) = e^(0.41 * (-0.318)) ≈ e^(-0.1304). Now, e^(-0.1304) is approximately 1 - 0.1304 + (0.1304)^2/2 - ... which is about 0.878.

So 293.15 * 0.878 ≈ let's compute that more accurately. 293 * 0.878:

293 * 0.8 = 234.4

293 * 0.07 = 20.51

293 * 0.008 = 2.344

Adding these: 234.4 + 20.51 = 254.91, +2.344 = 257.254 K.

So about 257.25 K, which is 257.25 - 273.15 = -15.9°C. Hmm, that's approximately -15.9°C. Looking at the options, I see option I is -15.8°C, which is very close. So that's probably the correct answer.

Wait, but another thought: did I use the correct formula? Because sometimes the formula is written as T2 = T1 * (V1/V2)^(γ-1). Another way I've seen it is using pressure, but since the process is adiabatic and we're dealing with volume and temperature, the formula I used should be correct.

Alternatively, the formula could also be written as T1^(γ) * V1^(γ-1) = T2^(γ) * V2^(γ-1), but that's more complicated. I think the first approach is correct. So yeah, the answer should be around -15.8°C, which is option I.

The problem involves an adiabatic expansion in a Wilson cloud chamber, where the volume ratio is 1.375 and the specific heat ratio is 1.41. Using the adiabatic temperature-volume relation, the final temperature is calculated to be approximately -15.9°C, which aligns closely with option I: -15.8°C.
