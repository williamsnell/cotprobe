Okay, so I have this logic problem to solve. It's about determining whether a given argument is valid using indirect truth tables. If it's invalid, I need to pick the correct counterexample from the options provided. Let me break this down step by step.

First, let me write down the argument:

Premises:
1. E ⊃ F
2. G ⊃ ~F

Conclusion:
~G ∨ ~E

I need to figure out if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises. If it doesn't, then I have to find a scenario (a counterexample) where the premises are true, but the conclusion is false.

Indirect truth tables work by assuming that the premises are true and the conclusion is false, then checking for consistency. If such a scenario is possible, the argument is invalid because we found a case where premises are true but the conclusion is false.

So, let's set up the indirect truth table. The variables involved are E, F, and G. Each can be true (T) or false (F). I'll need to consider all possible combinations, but since it's an indirect table, I only need to find one combination where premises are true and the conclusion is false.

The conclusion is ~G ∨ ~E. The negation of the conclusion would be G ∧ E (since the negation of ∨ is ∧, and we negate each part). So, assuming the conclusion is false means G is true and E is true.

So, we have:
G = T
E = T

Now, let's look at the premises with these values.

Premise 1: E ⊃ F. Since E is T, this becomes T ⊃ F. For this implication to be true, F must be T. Because if E is true, F must also be true for the implication to hold. So F must be T.

Premise 2: G ⊃ ~F. G is T, so this becomes T ⊃ ~F. For this to be true, ~F must be T, which means F must be F.

Wait, that's a problem. From Premise 1, F has to be T, but from Premise 2, F has to be F. That's a contradiction. So, in this scenario, the premises cannot both be true when E and G are T because F can't be both T and F at the same time.

Hmm, so does that mean there's no counterexample where the premises are true and the conclusion is false? Or did I make a mistake in setting this up?

Wait, let me double-check. The conclusion is ~G ∨ ~E. If the conclusion is false, then both G and E must be true. So, assuming G=T and E=T, then from Premise 1 (E⊃F), F must be T. Then, Premise 2 is G⊃~F, which would require ~F=T, so F=F. But F can't be both T and F. Therefore, there's no possible assignment where both premises are true and the conclusion is false. So, the argument must be valid because there's no counterexample.

But wait, let me check the options. The options include various counterexamples. If the argument is valid, the answer would be E: Valid. But let me make sure I didn't miss anything.

Alternatively, maybe I should construct a regular truth table to confirm.

Let me make a full truth table for E, F, G.

There are 8 possible rows.

1. E=T, F=T, G=T
2. E=T, F=T, G=F
3. E=T, F=F, G=T
4. E=T, F=F, G=F
5. E=F, F=T, G=T
6. E=F, F=T, G=F
7. E=F, F=F, G=T
8. E=F, F=F, G=F

For each row, check if premises are true, and then see if conclusion is true or false.

Let's go through each row:

1. E=T, F=T, G=T
Premise 1: E⊃F = T
Premise 2: G⊃~F = T⊃F = F (since ~F=F when F=T)
Conclusion: ~G∨~E = F∨F = F
So, in this case, premises are T and F. So, premises are not both true here.

2. E=T, F=T, G=F
Premise 1: T⊃T = T
Premise 2: F⊃F = T (because G=F, so G⊃ anything is T)
Conclusion: ~F∨~E = F∨F = F
Wait, conclusion is F. But premises are both T? Let's see.

Wait, G=F, so G⊃~F is F⊃~T (since F=T, ~F=F). So F⊃F is T. So premises are both T. Conclusion is ~G∨~E = T∨F = T. Wait, no. Let me recast:

Wait, in row 2, G=F, so ~G=T. E=T, so ~E=F. So ~G∨~E is T∨F = T. So conclusion is T. So in this case, premises are T (both), conclusion is T. So no problem.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me redo the conclusion for each row.

Row 1: E=T, F=T, G=T
Conclusion: ~G=T? No, G=T, so ~G=F. ~E=F. So ~G∨~E = F∨F = F.
But premises: E⊃F=T, G⊃~F=F. So premises are not both true. So no issue here.

Row 2: E=T, F=T, G=F
Conclusion: ~G=T (since G=F), ~E=F. So ~G∨~E = T∨F = T.
Premises: E⊃F=T, G⊃~F=F⊃F=T. So both premises are T, conclusion is T. So no problem.

Row 3: E=T, F=F, G=T
Premise1: E⊃F=F⊃F=T? Wait, E=T, F=F. So E⊃F=F. So premise1 is F. So premises can't both be T here.

Row 4: E=T, F=F, G=F
Premise1: E⊃F=F. So premise1=F, so premises not both T.

Row5: E=F, F=T, G=T
Premise1: E⊃F=T (since E=F). Premise2: G⊃~F=T⊃F=F. So premises are T and F.

Row6: E=F, F=T, G=F
Premise1: E⊃F=T. Premise2: G=F, so G⊃~F=F⊃F=T. So both premises are T.
Conclusion: ~G∨~E. G=F, so ~G=T. E=F, so ~E=T. So T∨T=T. So conclusion is T. So no issue.

Row7: E=F, F=F, G=T
Premise1: E⊃F=T. Premise2: G⊃~F=T⊃T=T. So both premises T.
Conclusion: ~G∨~E. G=T, so ~G=F. E=F, so ~E=T. So F∨T=T. So conclusion is T.

Row8: E=F, F=F, G=F
Premise1: E⊃F=T. Premise2: G=F, so G⊃~F=F⊃T=T. Both premises T.
Conclusion: ~G∨~E. G=F, so ~G=T. E=F, so ~E=T. So T∨T=T.

Wait, so looking at all rows, the only time both premises are T is in rows 2, 6,7,8.

In row 2, conclusion is T.

In rows 6,7,8, conclusion is T.

So in all cases where both premises are T, the conclusion is T. Therefore, there's no counterexample where premises are T and conclusion is F. So the argument is valid.

Wait, but the options have E: Valid, which would be the correct answer. But let me check the options again to make sure.

The options are:

A: Invalid. Counterexample when E, F, and G are true
B: Invalid. Counterexample when E is true, G is true, and F is true
C: Invalid. Counterexample when E and G are true and F is false
D: Invalid. Counterexample when E, F are true and G is false
E: Valid
F: Invalid. Counterexample when E is false, G is true, and F is true
G: Invalid. Counterexample when F and G are true and E is false
H: Invalid. Counterexample when E, F, and G are all false
I: Invalid. Counterexample when E is false, G is false, and F is true
J: Invalid. Counterexample when E is true, G is false, and F is true

Wait, but according to my analysis, the argument is valid, so the answer would be E. But let me double-check because sometimes I might have made a mistake.

Wait, but in the initial analysis using the indirect truth table, I assumed the conclusion is F (i.e., G and E are T). Then, from E and G being T, F must be T (from E⊃F), but then G⊃~F would require F=F, which is a contradiction. So, no possible assignment where both premises are T and conclusion is F. Thus, the argument is valid.

So the correct answer is E: Valid.

The argument is valid because there is no counterexample where the premises are true and the conclusion is false.
