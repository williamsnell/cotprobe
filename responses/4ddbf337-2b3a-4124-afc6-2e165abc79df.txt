Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about auction rules, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

Fernandez is attending an auction of Cross & Black's assets, which are being liquidated. The question is about which rule applies during the conduct of the auction. The options are A through G.

I remember that auctions have specific rules depending on whether they're with reserve or without reserve. Let's think about each option.

Option A says a bidder can retract his bid even after the fall of the hammer. Wait, the fall of the hammer usually signifies the end of the bidding, so after that, the bid is final. So A might be incorrect.

Option B states if the auction is with reserve, the auctioneer cannot withdraw the article at any time. Hmm, I think with reserve means the seller can set a minimum price, and the auctioneer can't sell below that. But can the auctioneer withdraw the item? I'm not sure. Maybe if the minimum isn't met, but I think once it's on the block, the seller can't usually withdraw it, but I'm not certain.

Option C says retracting a bid ends the auction. That doesn't sound right. If someone retracts their bid, the auction should continue, unless it's the only bidder left. So probably C is wrong.

Option D claims a bidder may retract their bid at any time until the fall of the hammer. I think this is correct because typically, you can withdraw a bid before the hammer falls. Once the hammer falls, the bid is binding.

Option E says the auctioneer can increase the bidding price at any time. I don't recall that being standard. Usually, the auctioneer calls out bids as they come in, not set a higher price themselves unless maybe there's a reserve.

Option F states if the auction is without reserve, the auctioneer can withdraw the article at any time before the hammer falls. Without reserve usually means the seller can't set a minimum, but can they withdraw the item? I think in some cases, yes, but I'm not sure if it's allowed at any time. Maybe only if there's a reason, like a higher offer elsewhere, but I'm a bit fuzzy on this.

Option G says all bids are final and can't be retracted. That doesn't sound right because I'm pretty sure you can retract a bid before the hammer falls.

Wait, let me think again. In auctions, once the hammer falls, the bid is final, and the item is sold. So any retraction must happen before that. So options A and G are probably wrong because they suggest you can't retract after the hammer falls, which is correct, but the question is about the rules during the auction.

Looking back, option D says you can retract until the hammer falls, which aligns with what I remember. So D is likely correct.

But wait, option F says without reserve, the auctioneer can withdraw the article any time before the fall. I think in a without reserve auction, the seller can't usually withdraw once bidding starts, but maybe only before. Or perhaps they can if they have the right. I'm not entirely certain, but I think the key here is whether the auction is with or without reserve.

Wait, another thought: in a reserve auction, the seller can set a minimum, and the auctioneer might have the authority to accept or reject bids. But in a without reserve, the seller can't set a minimum, but can they still withdraw the item? I'm not sure. Maybe not, because once it's on the block, it's up for sale. So F might not be correct.

So going back, I think D is correct because bidders can retract their bids until the hammer falls.

The correct answer is D: A bidder may retract his bid at any time until the falling of the hammer.

Answer: D
