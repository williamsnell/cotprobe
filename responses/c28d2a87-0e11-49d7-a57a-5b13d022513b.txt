Question:

A shopper in a store sees that a display case is about to fall on a second shopper's head. The shopper does nothing to warn or assist the second shopper, who is a stranger to her. She could have taken action to protect the second shopper without harming herself. Did the shopper have a duty to take action to try and protect the second shopper from injury?

Options:

A: No, the shopper is not required to intervene unless she is a store employee or security personnel.
B: Yes, the shopper must take action under the "Good Samaritan" law.
C: Yes, the fact that a person sees that action is needed for another's aid or protection does impose a legal duty to act.
D: No, there is no duty for a shopper to render assistance to a stranger even if it can be done without hurting herself.
E: Yes, the shopper is legally obligated to intervene because she was the first person to notice the danger.
F: Yes, the shopper is legally obligated to intervene in any potentially harmful situation.
G: Yes, the shopper must take action under the "last clear chance" doctrine.
H: No, a failure to act does not and cannot result in liability under any circumstances.
I: No, the shopper is not required to intervene unless she has a special relationship with the person in danger.
J: No, the shopper has no duty to act unless she directly caused the danger.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the shopper had a duty to help the second shopper. Let me break this down.

First, the question is about whether a shopper (who's just a regular person, not an employee) has a legal obligation to warn or assist a stranger when she sees that a display case is about to fall on them. She could have acted without harming herself, so it's not like she couldn't do anything due to danger.

I remember that generally, the law doesn't require people to help others unless there's a specific relationship, like if you're a parent or a child, or if you're the one who caused the danger. But in this case, she's just a bystander. So, I think the answer might have something to do with whether there's a duty to act when you can help without risk.

Looking at the options:

Option A says no, unless she's an employee. That makes sense because employees have a duty of care in their workplace, but as a shopper, she doesn't.

Option B mentions Good Samaritan laws. I think those usually protect people who help others from being sued if they act in good faith, but they don't require you to act. So B might not be correct because the law doesn't make it mandatory.

Option C says yes, because knowing help is needed creates a duty. I'm not sure about this. I think in some places, like if you're a rescuer who starts helping, you might have a duty to finish, but just seeing something happen doesn't automatically create a duty.

Option D states no, no duty to help strangers even if it's safe. This sounds familiar. I remember that generally, you're not required to help strangers unless you have a special relationship or caused the problem.

Option E says yes because she was first to notice. I don't think being first to notice imposes a legal duty. It's more about whether you can help without causing harm.

Option F says yes in any harmful situation. That seems too broad. The law usually doesn't require intervention unless specific conditions are met.

Option G is about the last clear chance doctrine. I think that's more about if someone could have prevented harm but didn't, but I'm not sure how it applies here.

Option H says no, failure to act never leads to liability. That might be too absolute because there are exceptions, like if you create a danger, or if you're in a special relationship.

Option I says no unless there's a special relationship. That aligns with what I was thinking earlier.

Option J says no unless she caused the danger. That's also correct, but the question doesn't say she caused the danger.

So, putting it together, I think the correct answer is either D or I. D is more general, stating no duty to help strangers regardless of the situation. I is more specific about the special relationship. Since the shopper is a stranger, I think D is correct.

The correct answer is D: No, there is no duty for a shopper to render assistance to a stranger even if it can be done without hurting herself.

Answer: D
