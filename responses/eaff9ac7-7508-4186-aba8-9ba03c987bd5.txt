Okay, so I have this problem where I need to use Euler's Method to approximate y(0.2) for a given initial-value problem. The differential equation is y'' + x y' + y = 0, with initial conditions y(0) = 2 and y'(0) = 3. The options are from A to J, and I need to pick the correct one.

First, I remember that Euler's Method is a numerical method used to approximate the solution to ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with a given initial value. It's typically used when an analytical solution is difficult to find. However, Euler's Method is straightforward but not very accurate because it uses the derivative at the beginning of the interval to estimate the function throughout the interval.

But wait, Euler's Method is usually applied to first-order ODEs. Here, the equation is a second-order ODE. So, I think I need to convert this second-order ODE into a system of first-order ODEs. That's right because you can't apply Euler's directly to a second-order equation.

So, to convert it, I'll let y' = z. Then, the original equation becomes y'' = -x z' - y. But since y'' is the derivative of y', which is z, so z' = y''. Therefore, the system of equations becomes:

y' = z  
z' = -x z' - y

Wait, that seems a bit confusing. Let me write it down more clearly. The original equation is y'' + x y' + y = 0. Let me rearrange it to y'' = -x y' - y. So, y'' is equal to -x times y' minus y. Since y'' is z', and y' is z, then z' = -x z - y.

So now I have a system of two first-order ODEs:

1. y' = z  
2. z' = -x z - y  

Now, I can apply Euler's Method on this system. I need to find y(0.2), so I'll choose a step size h. But the question doesn't specify the step size. Hmm, that's a problem. Wait, maybe it's implied that I should take a step size that gets me to x=0.2 directly. Alternatively, perhaps a step size of 0.1, taking two steps? Or maybe one step with h=0.2.

Wait, Euler's Method requires choosing a step size. Since the problem says to use Euler's Method without specifying, I might have to assume a reasonable step size. Alternatively, perhaps the step size is 0.1, so two steps to get to 0.2. Alternatively, maybe h=0.2, but that would be a single step. Let me think.

Wait, the problem doesn't specify the step size, which is a bit confusing. Maybe in the absence of specific instructions, I should choose the largest possible step size that gets me directly to x=0.2, which would be h=0.2. Alternatively, perhaps the standard step size is h=0.1, so two steps. But without knowing, I might have to proceed with h=0.2 as a single step, but I'm not sure if that's accurate enough. Alternatively, perhaps the step size is 0.1, so two steps.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to use a single step of h=0.2. Let me proceed with that.

So, initial point is x=0, y=2, and y'=z=3. So, at x=0, y=2, z=3.

I need to compute the next step using Euler's Method. So, for the first step (assuming h=0.2), I'll compute y1 and z1.

Euler's formula for a system is:

y1 = y0 + h * z0  
z1 = z0 + h * (dz/dx at x0, y0, z0)

But dz/dx is given by the second equation, which is dz/dx = -x z - y.

Wait, more accurately, the derivative of z is dz/dx = -x z - y. So, at x=0, dz/dx = -(0)*3 - 2 = 0 - 2 = -2.

So, z1 = z0 + h * (dz/dx)  
z1 = 3 + 0.2*(-2) = 3 - 0.4 = 2.6

Similarly, y1 = y0 + h * z0  
y1 = 2 + 0.2*3 = 2 + 0.6 = 2.6

So after one step with h=0.2, y(0.2) ≈ 2.6.

Wait, but looking at the options, 2.6 isn't one of them. The options are A:2.67, B:2.33, C:1.76, D:1.98, E:2.10, F:2.58, G:2.82, H:3.14, I:3.02, J:2.45.

Hmm, 2.6 isn't an option. So perhaps I made a mistake, or I should use a smaller step size. Maybe using h=0.1, taking two steps.

Let me try that. So, h=0.1, so two steps to reach x=0.2.

First step: x=0 to x=0.1.

At x=0, y=2, z=3.

Compute dz/dx at (0,2,3): dz/dx = -(0)*3 -2 = -2.

So z1 = z0 + h*dz/dx = 3 + 0.1*(-2) = 3 - 0.2 = 2.8

y1 = y0 + h*z0 = 2 + 0.1*3 = 2 + 0.3 = 2.3

Now, at x=0.1, y=2.3, z=2.8.

Second step: x=0.1 to x=0.2.

Compute dz/dx at (0.1, 2.3, 2.8):

dz/dx = -(0.1)*2.8 -2.3 = -0.28 -2.3 = -2.58

z2 = z1 + h*dz/dx = 2.8 + 0.1*(-2.58) = 2.8 - 0.258 = 2.542

y2 = y1 + h*z1 = 2.3 + 0.1*2.8 = 2.3 + 0.28 = 2.58

So, after two steps with h=0.1, y(0.2) ≈ 2.58. Looking at the options, F is 2.58. So that's an option.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects a single step with h=0.2, but that gave me 2.6, which isn't an option. So perhaps the intended step size is h=0.1, giving option F:2.58.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations.

First step, h=0.1:

y1 = 2 + 0.1*3 = 2.3  
z1 = 3 + 0.1*(-2) = 2.8

Second step:

dz/dx at x=0.1 is -0.1*2.8 -2.3 = -0.28 -2.3 = -2.58  
z2 = 2.8 + 0.1*(-2.58) = 2.8 - 0.258 = 2.542  
y2 = 2.3 + 0.1*2.8 = 2.3 + 0.28 = 2.58

Yes, that seems correct. So the approximation using Euler's Method with two steps of h=0.1 gives y(0.2) ≈ 2.58, which is option F.

To approximate y(0.2) using Euler's Method for the given initial-value problem y'' + xy' + y = 0 with y(0) = 2 and y'(0) = 3, we first convert the second-order ODE into a system of first-order ODEs by letting y' = z. This gives:

1. y' = z  
2. z' = -xz - y  

Using a step size of h = 0.1 (two steps to reach x = 0.2), we start at x = 0 with y = 2 and z = 3.

**First step (x = 0 to x = 0.1):**  
- Compute dz/dx = -x z - y = -(0)(3) - 2 = -2.  
- Update z: z₁ = z₀ + h * dz/dx = 3 + 0.1*(-2) = 2.8.  
- Update y: y₁ = y₀ + h * z₀ = 2 + 0.1*3 = 2.3.

**Second step (x = 0.1 to x = 0.2):**  
- Compute dz/dx = -(0.1)(2.8) - 2.3 = -0.28 - 2.3 = -2.58.  
- Update z: z₂ = z₁ + h * dz/dx = 2.8 + 0.1*(-2.58) = 2.542.  
- Update y: y₂ = y₁ + h * z₁ = 2.3 + 0.1*2.8 = 2.58.

Thus, the approximation of y(0.2) using Euler's Method with h = 0.1 is **2.58**, which corresponds to option F.
