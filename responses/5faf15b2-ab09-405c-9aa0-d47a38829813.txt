Okay, so Delia is trying to choose between Harvard and Yale. She's accepted to both, so she's got two great options. But now she's having trouble deciding, which means she must be facing some kind of psychological conflict. I need to figure out which one from the options applies here.

Let me look at the options. The options are various types of conflicts or psychological terms. Let's go through them one by one.

Option A: Cognitive-dissonance. That's about holding conflicting thoughts or feelings, which creates mental discomfort. But Delia's issue is more about making a choice between two positive options rather than conflicting thoughts. So maybe not A.

Option B: Intrinsic-extrinsic. These terms relate to motivation. Intrinsic is internal motivation, extrinsic is external rewards. I'm not sure if this fits, because the conflict is about choices, not motivation types.

Option C: Reward-punishment. That's more about behavior being influenced by positive or negative outcomes. Again, Delia isn't being punished or rewarded here; it's about choosing between two positive options.

Option D: Internal-external. This might refer to internal vs external factors influencing a decision. But Delia's conflict is internal, between two good choices, so maybe not D.

Option E: Frustration-aggression. This is when someone gets frustrated and acts aggressively. Doesn't seem to apply here since Delia is just deciding, not acting aggressively.

Option F: Approach-avoidance. This is a type of conflict where a person is both attracted to and repelled by the same goal. So if she likes aspects of both schools but also has fears or hesitations, this could fit. But wait, isn't this more about a single choice having both positive and negative aspects?

Option G: Approach-approach. This is when a person has two positive options to choose from, leading to a conflict because both are appealing. That sounds exactly like Delia's situationâ€”she likes both Harvard and Yale, so it's hard to pick one.

Option H: Avoidance-avoidance. This is when both options are negative, and the person is trying to avoid the worst outcome. Not the case here since both are good schools.

Option I: Passive-aggressive. This is a personality trait or behavior, not a conflict type. Doesn't fit.

Option J: Positive-negative. Not a standard psychological term, so probably not.

So, considering all this, Delia is facing a choice between two positive options, both of which she wants. That's an approach-approach conflict. So the answer should be G.

The correct answer is **G: approach-approach**. Delia is struggling to choose between two desirable options, Harvard and Yale, which fits the approach-approach conflict.
