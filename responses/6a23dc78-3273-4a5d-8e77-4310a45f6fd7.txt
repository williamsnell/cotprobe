Okay, so I've got this problem here about a water pump and figuring out the surface roughness of the pipe. Let me try to break this down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my fluid mechanics, but I'll give it a shot.

First, the problem states that 500 cfm of water is pumped through a horizontal pipe. The pipe is 10 inches in inside diameter and 800 feet long. The pump is 65% efficient and requires 80 hp of input power. I need to find the surface roughness, and the options are given from A to J.

Hmm, I remember that the key here is probably using the concept of head and then applying the Moody diagram or maybe the Darcy-Weisbach equation. Since it's a pump problem, I think the Darcy-Weisbach equation is the way to go. Let me recall: the equation is h_f = (f * L * v²) / (2g * D), where h_f is the head loss, f is the friction factor, L is the pipe length, v is the velocity, g is acceleration due to gravity, and D is the diameter.

But wait, I also know that the pump's efficiency comes into play. The pump's actual work done is related to the head and the flow rate. Let me think. The power input to the pump is given, and considering efficiency, the actual power delivered should be less. So, Power (input) = Power (output) / efficiency. Power output here would be the work done to overcome the pressure loss, which is related to the head.

Right, the formula for pump power is P = (density * g * h_f * Q) / efficiency, where P is power, density is the fluid density, g is gravity, h_f is head loss, Q is flow rate, and efficiency is the pump's efficiency.

So, I'll need to find h_f first. Let me list the steps:

1. Convert all units to consistent units.
2. Calculate the velocity of the water in the pipe.
3. Use the Darcy-Weisbach equation to find the friction factor f.
4. Use the Moody diagram to find the relative roughness (epsilon/D) based on the Reynolds number and f.

Wait, but I think the approach is a bit different. Since I don't know the friction factor f or the roughness yet, maybe I can find the Reynolds number first, then use the Moody diagram to find f, and then work backwards to find the roughness.

But wait, I think I'm getting ahead of myself. Let's get the units right first. The flow rate is 500 cubic feet per minute (cfm). I need to convert that to cubic meters per second or perhaps keep it in compatible units. Let me see, since the pipe is in inches and feet, maybe it's better to work in US customary units.

Let me note down the given data:

- Q = 500 cfm (flow rate)
- D = 10 inches (inside diameter)
- L = 800 ft (length)
- Pump power input, P_input = 80 hp
- Pump efficiency, η = 65% = 0.65

I need to find the surface roughness, which I think is the relative roughness (epsilon/D), where epsilon is the absolute roughness.

First, I'll calculate the velocity v. Q is the volume flow rate, so Q = A * v. The cross-sectional area A is π*(D/2)^2. Let me compute that.

D is 10 inches, which is 10/12 = 0.8333 feet. So D = 0.8333 ft. Then A = π*(0.8333/2)^2 = π*(0.41665)^2 ≈ π * 0.1736 ≈ 0.544 ft².

Wait, wait, actually, 10 inches is 10/12 = 0.8333 feet. So the radius is 0.8333/2 = 0.41665 ft. So A = π*(0.41665)^2 ≈ 0.544 ft².

Now, Q is 500 cfm. So to find velocity v in ft/min, v = Q / A = 500 / 0.544 ≈ 919.05 ft/min. But I think I'll need velocity in ft/s for the Darcy equation, which uses seconds. So, 919.05 ft/min is 919.05 / 60 ≈ 15.3175 ft/s.

Next, I'll calculate the head loss h_f that the pump is working against. The pump power output (useful work) is P_output = P_input * η. P_input is 80 hp, so P_output = 80 * 0.65 = 52 hp.

Wait, power in hp. I need to convert that to watts or keep it in ft-lbf/s. Since I'm working in US units, maybe it's better to convert hp to ft-lbf per second.

1 hp = 550 ft-lbf/s. So 52 hp = 52 * 550 = 28,600 ft-lbf/s.

The power output is the work done per unit time, which is P = (density * g * h_f * Q) / η. Wait, no, because I've already considered efficiency. So P_output = (density * g * h_f * Q). Alternatively, since I'm using the right units, I can set up the equation.

But wait, let me think again. The power output of the pump is the work done to overcome the head loss. So P_output = (density * g * h_f * Q). But wait, the units might not align. Let me make sure I have the right formula.

Power (output) = (density) * g * h_f * Q, where Q is in volume per time, and h_f is in feet.

So, I can solve for h_f.

But first, I need to make sure the units are consistent. Let me check:

- density of water is about 62.42 lb/ft³
- g is 32.174 ft/s²
- Q is in ft³/min, but I think I should convert it to ft³/s for consistency.

Wait, earlier I calculated Q as 500 cfm, which is 500 ft³/min, so in ft³/s it's 500/60 ≈ 8.333 ft³/s.

So, P_output = density * g * h_f * Q.

So rearranging, h_f = P_output / (density * g * Q).

Plugging in the numbers:

P_output = 28,600 ft-lbf/s (since 52 hp is 28,600 ft-lbf/s)
density = 62.42 lb/ft³
g = 32.174 ft/s²
Q = 8.333 ft³/s

So,

h_f = 28,600 / (62.42 * 32.174 * 8.333)

Let me compute the denominator first:

62.42 * 32.174 ≈ 2006.2 (since 62.42 * 32 ≈ 2000, and 62.42 * 0.174 ≈ 10.84, so total ≈ 2010.84)

Then multiply by 8.333: 2010.84 * 8.333 ≈ 2010.84 * 8 = 16,086.72, and 2010.84 * 0.333 ≈ 670, so total ≈ 16,756.72.

So h_f ≈ 28,600 / 16,756.72 ≈ 1.706 feet.

Wait, that seems quite small. Let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, 62.42 lb/ft³ is correct for water. 32.174 ft/s² is correct for g.

Q is 8.333 ft³/s, correct.

So 62.42 *32.174 = let me calculate more accurately.

62.42 *32 = 1997.44

62.42 *0.174 = Let's compute 62.42 *0.1 = 6.242, 62.42 *0.07=4.3694, 62.42 *0.004=0.2497. Adding up: 6.242 +4.3694=10.6114 +0.2497=10.8611.

So total is 1997.44 +10.8611=2008.3011.

Then 2008.3011 *8.333 ≈ ?

Well, 2008.3011 *8 = 16,066.4088

2008.3011 *0.333 ≈ 2008.3011 * (1/3) ≈ 669.4337

So total ≈ 16,066.4088 +669.4337 ≈ 16,735.8425.

So h_f = 28,600 /16,735.8425 ≈ 1.706 feet.

Hmm, that seems low, but maybe it's correct. Now, moving on.

Now, using the Darcy-Weisbach equation: h_f = (f * L * v²) / (2g * D).

We can rearrange this to solve for f: f = (2g * D * h_f) / (L * v²).

Plugging in the numbers:

g = 32.174 ft/s²
D = 0.8333 ft
h_f = 1.706 ft
L = 800 ft
v = 15.3175 ft/s

So,

f = (2 *32.174 *0.8333 *1.706) / (800 * (15.3175)^2 )

Let me compute numerator and denominator separately.

Numerator:

2 *32.174 =64.348

64.348 *0.8333 ≈ 64.348 *0.8333 ≈ 53.623

53.623 *1.706 ≈ Let's compute 53.623 *1.7 =91.1591, and 53.623 *0.006≈0.3217. So total≈91.4808.

Denominator:

(15.3175)^2 = approx 15.3175 *15.3175. Let me compute 15^2=225, 0.3175^2≈0.1008. Cross terms: 2*15*0.3175=9.525. So total ≈225 +9.525 +0.1008 ≈234.6258.

So denominator is 800 *234.6258 ≈ 800 *234.6258 = 800*200=160,000, 800*34.6258≈27,700.64, so total≈187,700.64.

So f ≈91.4808 /187,700.64 ≈0.0004875.

Wait, that's a very low friction factor. That doesn't seem right. Typically, for smooth pipes, f is around 0.02, but for rough pipes, it can be higher. Wait, but I might have made a mistake in the calculations.

Wait, let me check the calculations again.

First, numerator: 2 *32.174 *0.8333 *1.706.

2*32.174=64.348.

64.348 *0.8333: Let's compute 64 *0.8333=53.33, 0.348*0.8333≈0.290. So total≈53.62.

53.62 *1.706: 53.62 *1=53.62, 53.62 *0.7=37.534, 53.62 *0.006≈0.3217. So 53.62 +37.534=91.154 +0.3217≈91.4757.

Denominator: 800 * (15.3175)^2.

15.3175^2: Let's compute more accurately. 15.3175 *15.3175.

15 *15 =225.

15 *0.3175=4.7625.

0.3175*15=4.7625.

0.3175*0.3175≈0.1008.

So, (15 +0.3175)^2 =15^2 + 2*15*0.3175 +0.3175^2 =225 + 9.525 +0.1008≈234.6258.

So 800 *234.6258 =187,700.64.

So f≈91.4757 /187700.64 ≈0.0004875.

Wait, that's about 0.0004875, which is 4.875e-4. That seems way too low. Typically, for water flow, the friction factor f is between 0.01 and 0.1 for turbulent flow, depending on the roughness. So maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the units. Let me check again. Oh wait, the velocity v was calculated as 15.3175 ft/s. But in the Darcy equation, the velocity is in ft/s, which I think I did correctly.

Wait, maybe I should double-check the power calculation. Let me redo that.

Power output (P_output) = 80 hp * 0.65 =52 hp.

1 hp =550 ft-lbf/s, so P_output =52 *550=28,600 ft-lbf/s.

Then, h_f = P_output / (density * g * Q).

Density of water is 62.42 lb/ft³.

So h_f =28,600 / (62.42 *32.174 *8.333).

Wait, 62.42 *32.174 = let me compute that again.

62.42 *30 =1872.6.

62.42 *2.174: 62.42 *2=124.84, 62.42 *0.174≈10.86.

So 62.42 *32.174 ≈1872.6 +124.84 +10.86 ≈2008.3.

Then multiply by Q=8.333: 2008.3 *8.333 ≈2008.3 *8=16,066.4 and 2008.3 *0.333≈669.433. So total≈16,066.4 +669.433≈16,735.833.

So h_f =28,600 /16,735.833≈1.706 ft. That's correct.

So that part is correct. Then, using Darcy:

h_f = (f * L * v²)/(2gD)

So f = (2gD h_f) / (L v²).

Plugging in:

g=32.174 ft/s²

D=0.8333 ft

h_f=1.706 ft

L=800 ft

v=15.3175 ft/s

So,

f = (2 *32.174 *0.8333 *1.706) / (800 * (15.3175)^2 )

Compute numerator: 2 *32.174=64.348.

64.348 *0.8333 ≈53.623.

53.623 *1.706 ≈91.4757.

Denominator: 800 * (15.3175)^2.

15.3175^2=234.6258.

800 *234.6258=187,700.64.

So f≈91.4757 /187700.64≈0.0004875.

Hmm, that's 0.0004875, which is 4.875e-4. That seems way too low for a friction factor. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the velocity calculation. Q is 500 cfm, which is 500 ft³/min. The area A is π*(0.8333/2)^2=π*(0.41665)^2≈0.544 ft². So v=500/0.544≈919.05 ft/min, which is 919.05/60≈15.3175 ft/s. That's correct.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I should use the head in meters instead of feet, but no, since all units are in feet, that should be fine.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the pump power equation. Wait, the pump power output is the work done to lift the water, which is P = density * g * h_f * Q. But wait, that's if h_f is the head in feet. So that should be correct.

Wait, maybe I should consider that the power output is the work done per unit time, so P = (density * g * h_f * Q) / η? No, wait no, because I've already accounted for efficiency in the P_output. Because P_input = P_output / η. So P_output = η * P_input. So I think the initial approach is correct.

Hmm, maybe the issue is that I'm using the wrong formula. Alternatively, perhaps the pipe is not horizontal, but the problem states it's horizontal, so that's fine.

Wait, perhaps I should check if the flow is laminar or turbulent. The Reynolds number can help determine that.

Reynolds number Re = (v * D) / ν, where ν is the kinematic viscosity of water.

At 60°F, the kinematic viscosity ν for water is approximately 1.100e-5 ft²/s.

So Re = (15.3175 ft/s * 0.8333 ft) / (1.100e-5 ft²/s)

Compute numerator: 15.3175 *0.8333 ≈12.8479 ft²/s.

Then Re=12.8479 /1.100e-5 ≈1,167,990.

That's a very high Reynolds number, so the flow is definitely turbulent, which means the Moody diagram applies, and the friction factor depends on the relative roughness.

Given that f is 0.0004875, which is about 0.0005, that's very low. But in the Moody diagram, for Re=1.168e6, the friction factor for smooth pipes (epsilon approaching 0) is around 0.01. So 0.0005 is way too low. Hmm, that suggests I might have made a mistake.

Wait, let me think again. Did I calculate f correctly? Because 0.0004875 seems way too low. Maybe I messed up the calculation.

Wait, numerator: 2*32.174=64.348.

64.348 *0.8333=53.623.

53.623 *1.706=91.4757.

Denominator: 800 * (15.3175)^2=800 *234.6258=187,700.64.

So f=91.4757/187700.64≈0.0004875.

Wait, that's 0.0004875, which is 4.875e-4. Hmm, that's way too low. Let me see if I can find where I went wrong.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the velocity calculation. Let me recheck.

Q =500 cfm. D=10 inches, so radius r=5 inches=5/12=0.4167 ft.

Area A=π*r²=π*(0.4167)^2≈3.1416*(0.1736)≈0.544 ft².

v=Q/A=500/0.544≈919.05 ft/min=15.3175 ft/s. That's correct.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the pump power formula is different. Maybe I should use P = (f * L * v^5 )/(2 * D * g) * (density/220) or something like that, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps using the formula for head in terms of power.

Wait, another approach: The head produced by the pump (h) can be found using h = (P_input * 550) / (density * g * Q * η).

Wait, let me try that. So h = (80 *550) / (62.42 *32.174 *500/60 *0.65).

Wait, 500 cfm is 500/60 ft³/s.

So,

h = (80 *550) / (62.42 *32.174 * (500/60) *0.65 )

Calculate numerator: 80 *550=44,000.

Denominator:62.42 *32.174 ≈2008.3, multiplied by (500/60)≈8.333, so 2008.3 *8.333≈16,735. Then multiplied by 0.65: 16,735 *0.65≈10,877.75.

So h ≈44,000 /10,877.75≈4.045 feet.

Wait, earlier I got h_f≈1.706 ft. Now this approach gives h≈4.045 ft. That's a discrepancy. Which one is correct?

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula h = (P * 550) / (density * g * Q * η). So P is in hp, so:

h = (80 *550) / (62.42 *32.174 * (500/60) *0.65 )

So,

80 *550=44,000.

Denominator:

62.42 *32.174≈2008.3.

(500/60)=8.333.

Multiply all: 2008.3 *8.333≈16,735.

Then multiply by 0.65: 16,735 *0.65≈10,877.75.

So h≈44,000/10,877.75≈4.045 ft.

Wait, but earlier calculation using P_output gave h_f=1.706 ft. So which is correct?

Wait, perhaps I confused head loss with the actual head the pump provides. Because the pump's head is the head loss plus any other losses, but in this case, it's just the head loss. So perhaps the correct h_f is 4.045 ft, not 1.706 ft. So I must have made a mistake in the earlier approach.

Wait, let me think again. The pump power input is 80 hp, and the efficiency is 65%, so the power output is 80*0.65=52 hp, which is 52*550=28,600 ft-lbf/s.

The pump's work is to raise the water to a certain head h_f. So the power output is also equal to (density) * g * Q * h_f.

So, 28,600 = 62.42 *32.174 * (500/60) * h_f.

Wait, let me compute:

62.42 *32.174 =2008.3.

(500/60)=8.333.

So,

28,600 =2008.3 *8.333 * h_f.

Compute 2008.3 *8.333 ≈16,735.

So,

h_f=28,600 /16,735≈1.706 ft.

So that's correct. But the other approach gave me h=4.045 ft. That suggests a confusion between head and head loss.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. The pump's head (h) is equal to the head loss (h_f) because it's pumping against the friction loss. So I think the correct h_f is 1.706 ft.

But then, with that, the friction factor f comes out to be 0.0004875, which is way too low. That doesn't make sense. So maybe I made a mistake in the Darcy equation.

Wait, perhaps I should check the Darcy equation again. The Darcy equation is h_f = (f * L * v²) / (2g * D).

Wait, I think I might have mixed up the units somewhere. Let me check the units again.

h_f is in feet, f is dimensionless, L is in feet, v is in ft/s, g is in ft/s², D is in feet.

So the units on the right side: (f * L [ft] * v² [ft²/s²]) / (2g [ft/s²] * D [ft]).

So the denominator has (ft/s² * ft) = ft²/s².

The numerator has (ft * ft²/s²) = ft³/s².

So overall, (ft³/s²) / (ft²/s²) )= ft. Which matches h_f in ft. So units are correct.

Hmm, but the f I'm getting is too low. Maybe the error is elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the head using the pump power correctly. Let me try another approach.

The power output of the pump is P_output = 52 hp =52 *550=28,600 ft-lbf/s.

The power can also be expressed as P = density * g * h * Q, where h is the head in feet and Q is in ft³/s.

So,

h = P_output / (density * g * Q)

Plugging in:

h =28,600 / (62.42 *32.174 *8.333)

Which is the same as before, giving h≈1.706 ft.

So that's correct.

Then, using Darcy-Weisbach:

h_f = (f * L * v²) / (2gD)

Rearranged for f:

f = (2gD h_f) / (L v²)

Plugging in:

g=32.174 ft/s²

D=0.8333 ft

h_f=1.706 ft

L=800 ft

v=15.3175 ft/s

So,

f=(2 *32.174 *0.8333 *1.706) / (800 * (15.3175)^2 )

Compute numerator:

2 *32.174=64.348

64.348 *0.8333≈53.623

53.623 *1.706≈91.4757

Denominator:

800 * (15.3175)^2=800 *234.6258≈187,700.64

So,

f≈91.4757 /187,700.64≈0.0004875

Hmm, that's 0.0004875, which is about 0.00049. That's very low. But from the Moody diagram, for Re=1.168e6, which is in the turbulent flow, the friction factor f is around 0.01 for smooth pipes and increases with roughness. So getting f=0.00049 is impossible because that's even lower than the smooth pipe value. So something's wrong here.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of h_f. Let me check again.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the pump is not just overcoming the friction loss but also any potential energy change. But since the pipe is horizontal, there's no elevation change, so h_f is just the friction head loss. So that part is correct.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the pump's power is being used to not just overcome friction but also to maintain the flow velocity, so maybe I need to account for something else. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the Hazen-Williams equation instead of Darcy-Weisbach, but that's usually for water at certain velocities and gives the head loss directly.

Wait, let me try using the Hazen-Williams equation. The formula is:

h_f = (0.008 * C * D^1.5 * L) / (v^1.85 )

Where C is the Hazen-Williams coefficient, which is around 120 for water at 60°F.

But I'm not sure if that's the right approach here, because I don't know the roughness yet, and the Hazen-Williams equation is more empirical and depends on the pipe material, which isn't given.

Alternatively, perhaps I should proceed with Moody's diagram approach, but I'm stuck because the f I'm getting is too low.

Wait, perhaps I should check if the flow is actually in the turbulent flow regime. Earlier, I calculated Re≈1.168e6, which is well into the turbulent flow. So the Moody diagram applies.

Wait, perhaps I should look for f in the Moody diagram for Re=1.168e6. For a given f, what is the relative roughness (epsilon/D)?

But I don't have the Moody diagram in front of me, but I can estimate. For Re=1e6, f is about 0.01 for smooth pipes (epsilon approaching 0). As epsilon increases, f increases.

So, if f=0.0004875, which is much lower than 0.01, that suggests that there's a miscalculation because even smooth pipes don't have f that low for Re=1e6.

Wait, that can't be right. So perhaps the error is in the calculation of h_f.

Wait, let me think again: P_output = density * g * h_f * Q.

Wait, but I think that's incorrect. Because power is energy per unit time, and energy is force times distance. The force here is the pressure force, which is (density * v^2 /2) * area, but I'm getting confused. Maybe I should use the relation between power and head more carefully.

Wait, another approach: The head produced by the pump (h) can be found using:

Power (in hp) = (density * g * Q * h) / (efficiency * 550)

So,

h = (Power * 550 * efficiency) / (density * g * Q)

Plugging in the numbers:

Power =80 hp

efficiency=0.65

density=62.42 lb/ft³

g=32.174 ft/s²

Q=500 cfm=500/60≈8.333 ft³/s.

So,

h=(80 *550 *0.65) / (62.42 *32.174 *8.333 )

Calculate numerator:80 *550=44,000; 44,000 *0.65=28,600.

Denominator:62.42 *32.174≈2008.3; 2008.3 *8.333≈16,735.

So,

h≈28,600 /16,735≈1.706 ft.

Same result as before. So h_f is indeed 1.706 ft.

So back to Darcy equation:

f=(2gD h_f)/(L v²)

Plugging in again:

2*32.174=64.348

64.348*0.8333≈53.623

53.623*1.706≈91.4757

Denominator:800*(15.3175)^2=800*234.6258≈187,700.64

f≈91.4757/187700.64≈0.0004875.

This is perplexing. I must have made a mistake somewhere. Let me consider that maybe the friction factor is 0.0004875, but that seems impossible for a pipe with Re=1e6. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of v or Q.

Wait, wait, perhaps I should double-check the calculation of v.

Q=500 cfm=500 ft³/min.

Area A=π*(10/24)^2 ft². Wait, wait, 10 inches is 10/12=0.8333 ft. So radius r=0.8333/2=0.41665 ft.

A=π*(0.41665)^2≈0.544 ft².

v=Q/A=500/0.544≈919.05 ft/min=15.3175 ft/s.

That's correct.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the pump is not just overcoming friction but also providing kinetic energy. Wait, but the Darcy equation already accounts for the velocity head, so I think that's already included.

Wait, perhaps I should use the Bernoulli equation, considering the pump adds energy to the fluid. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the equation for head in terms of pump performance, such as:

Head (h) = (P_input * 550 * efficiency) / (density * g * Q)

Which gives the same result as before, h≈1.706 ft.

So, I'm stuck. The friction factor comes out to be 0.0004875, which is way too low. But according to the Moody diagram, for Re=1e6, f is around 0.01 for smooth pipes, and increases with roughness.

This suggests that either I'm making a mistake in the calculations or perhaps the problem is designed in a way that the surface roughness is extremely smooth, but looking at the options, the smallest roughness is 0.001 inches (option J), and the next is 0.002 (A), up to 0.01 (D).

Wait, maybe I should proceed with the f value I have and see what relative roughness comes out to be. Using the Moody diagram, for Re=1.168e6 and f=0.0004875, what's the relative roughness (epsilon/D)?

But I don't have the exact Moody chart, but I can estimate. For Re=1e6, the friction factor for smooth pipes (epsilon/D approaching 0) is about 0.01. For f=0.0004875, which is much lower than 0.01, that would imply a super-smooth pipe, which is not practical. Hence, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should check if I inverted the equation. Let me make sure.

The Darcy equation is h_f = (f * L * v²) / (2gD)

So f = (2gD h_f) / (L v²)

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the relative roughness (epsilon/D) using the Moody diagram. Given Re and f, I can find the relative roughness.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the von Karman equation to estimate f, but that's for fully rough pipes where f is a function of Re.

Wait, for turbulent flow, if the relative roughness is high enough, the flow is in the fully rough (viscous) region where f is independent of Re and depends only on epsilon/D.

But in this case, with Re=1.168e6, which is high, the pipe is likely in the smooth or transitional region, where f decreases with increasing Re for a given roughness.

Wait, but given that f is 0.0004875, which is way lower than 0.01, perhaps the pipe is extremely smooth, which would correspond to a very low epsilon/D.

But let's see: if f=0.0004875, Re=1.168e6, what is epsilon/D?

I think I'll need to use the Moody diagram or an approximation. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the empirical relation for smooth pipes, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the equation for f in terms of Re and relative roughness. For smooth pipes, f = 0.316 / sqrt(Re), which applies for laminar flow (Re < 2100), but here Re is 1e6, so it's turbulent, and this equation doesn't apply. So that won't help.

Wait, perhaps I should accept that the f I'm getting is too low and consider that maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me try to compute f again.

Compute numerator: 2 *32.174 *0.8333 *1.706.

2*32.174=64.348

64.348 *0.8333=53.623

53.623 *1.706=91.4757

Denominator:800 * (15.3175)^2=800 *234.6258≈187,700.64

So f=91.4757 /187700.64≈0.0004875.

Wait, perhaps I should check if the formula was correct. Oh wait! I think I made a mistake in the formula. The Darcy equation is h_f = (f * L * v²) / (2g * D), but I think I might have missed a factor. Let me double-check.

Yes, the Darcy equation is correct. So perhaps the issue is elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the pump's power is also related to the kinetic energy. But no, the Darcy equation already accounts for the velocity head.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula for head in terms of pump performance, which is:

h = (P_input * 550 * η) / (density * g * Q)

Which gives the same result as before, h=1.706 ft.

So, perhaps the only conclusion is that f=0.0004875 is correct, which would imply an extremely smooth pipe. But looking at the options, the smallest roughness is 0.001 inches (option J). So the relative roughness epsilon/D would be 0.001 inches /10 inches=0.0001.

Wait, that's 0.0001, which is 1e-4. Let me see what f would be for Re=1e6 and epsilon/D=0.0001.

Looking at the Moody diagram, for Re=1e6 and epsilon/D=0.0001, f is approximately 0.005. But wait, that's higher than the f I calculated (0.0004875). Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps I should proceed with the assumption that f=0.0004875 corresponds to a relative roughness of around 0.0001, which is 0.001 inches for D=10 inches, which is option J.

But that seems inconsistent with the f value. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation and the correct f is higher.

Wait, perhaps I should try to compute f again, but perhaps I missed a decimal point.

Wait, 91.4757 /187700.64 is approximately 0.0004875, which is 4.875e-4.

But if I consider that I might have made a mistake in the calculation, perhaps I should check the velocity again.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the pump's power is not just used for overcoming friction but also for kinetic energy. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula that combines both head loss and kinetic energy, but I think the Darcy equation already includes that.

At this point, I'm stuck. Given the time I've spent, perhaps I should proceed with the assumption that the relative roughness is 0.001 inches (option J), but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation and the correct f is 0.005, which would correspond to a roughness of 0.006 inches (option C).

Wait, but I'm not sure. Given the options, perhaps the correct answer is E:0.005 inches.

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the correct f is 0.0004875, which would correspond to a relative roughness of around 0.00005, which is 0.0005 inches, but that's not one of the options. The options don't go that low.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of h_f. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: Using the pump's performance curve, perhaps I can find the head and then use that to find f.

But without more data, that's not possible. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the specific speed or other pump parameters, but I don't have them.

At this point, I think I've made a mistake in the calculation, but I can't figure it out. Given the time I've spent, perhaps I should select the answer that corresponds to the f I calculated, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is E:0.005 inches.
</think>

To determine the surface roughness of the pipe, the following steps were taken:

1. **Convert Units and Calculate Velocity**:  
   The flow rate \( Q = 500 \, \text{cfm} \) was converted to \( 8.333 \, \text{ft}^3/\text{s} \). The cross-sectional area \( A \) of the pipe with diameter \( D = 10 \, \text{in.} = 0.8333 \, \text{ft} \) was calculated as \( A = \pi (0.41665)^2 \approx 0.544 \, \text{ft}^2 \). The velocity \( v \) was then found using \( v = Q / A \approx 15.3175 \, \text{ft/s} \).

2. **Calculate Head Loss \( h_f \)**:  
   The pump's input power was \( 80 \, \text{hp} \), and its efficiency was \( 65\% \), giving an output power of \( 52 \, \text{hp} = 28,600 \, \text{ft-lbf/s} \). Using the formula \( P_{\text{output}} = \rho g Q h_f \), where \( \rho = 62.42 \, \text{lb/ft}^3 \) and \( g = 32.174 \, \text{ft/s}^2 \), the head loss was calculated as \( h_f \approx 1.706 \, \text{ft} \).

3. **Darcy-Weisbach Equation for Friction Factor \( f \)**:  
   Rearranging the Darcy-Weisbach equation \( h_f = \frac{f L v^2}{2 g D} \), the friction factor \( f \) was computed as \( f \approx 0.0004875 \). This value is unusually low for a pipe with a Reynolds number \( \text{Re} \approx 1.168 \times 10^6 \), suggesting either an error in calculation or an extremely smooth pipe.

4. **Reynolds Number and Moody Diagram**:  
   The Reynolds number confirmed turbulent flow (\( \text{Re} \approx 1.168 \times 10^6 \)). For such high \( \text{Re} \), the friction factor \( f \) should be around \( 0.01 \) for smooth pipes, but the calculated \( f \) was much lower. This discrepancy suggests the pipe is unusually smooth, corresponding to a very low relative roughness \( \epsilon / D \).

5. **Estimate Surface Roughness**:  
   Given the options, the smallest roughness \( \epsilon = 0.001 \, \text{in.} \) (option J) corresponds to \( \epsilon / D = 0.0001 \), which aligns with the calculated \( f \). However, this is inconsistent with typical pipe roughness values. The next plausible option is \( \epsilon = 0.005 \, \text{in.} \) (option E), though the calculations suggest a smoother pipe.

Given the analysis, the most reasonable answer based on the options provided is:

**Answer: E**
