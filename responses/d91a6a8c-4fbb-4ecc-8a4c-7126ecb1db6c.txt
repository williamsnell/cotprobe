Okay, so I have this equation to solve using the Birge-Vieta method. The equation is x³ - 11x² + 32x - 22 = 0, and p is given as 0.5. The goal is to find a real root correct to three decimal places, and I need to choose the correct answer from the given options.

First, I'm a bit confused because I'm not entirely sure what the Birge-Vieta method exactly entails. I think it might be a variation of the Newton-Raphson method or something similar for finding roots. Maybe it's another root-finding technique. Let me try to recall. Oh wait, perhaps it's a method that uses a parameter p to adjust the convergence rate or something like that.

So, the equation is a cubic, so it should have three real roots or one real and two complex roots. The problem specifies a real root, so there must be at least one. Let me first try to find the real roots by some means to see possible candidates.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the rational root theorem to check for possible rational roots. The possible roots are factors of 22 over 1, so ±1, ±2, ±11, ±22.

Let me test x=1: 1 -11 +32 -22 = 0. So 1 is a root! That's helpful. So (x-1) is a factor.

Now, I can perform polynomial division to factor the cubic. Dividing x³ -11x² +32x -22 by (x-1):

Using synthetic division:

1 | 1  -11  32  -22
    |      1  -10  22
    -----------------
      1  -10  22    0

So the quadratic factor is x² -10x +22. Now, to find the other roots, I can solve x² -10x +22 = 0. Using the quadratic formula:

x = [10 ± sqrt(100 - 88)] / 2 = [10 ± sqrt(12)] / 2 = [10 ± 2*sqrt(3)] / 2 = 5 ± sqrt(3).

So the roots are 1, 5 + sqrt(3) ≈ 6.732, and 5 - sqrt(3) ≈ 3.268. Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see 1, 3.268, or 6.732. The options are A: 0.618, B: 0.732, C:1, D:1.5, E:2.236, F:1.414, G:0.5, H:2, I:2.618, J:1.732.

So one of these is a root. But earlier, we found x=1 is a root, which is option C. So why are we using the Birge-Vieta method then? Because if x=1 is a root, why not just take that?

Wait, maybe the question is not about finding all roots, but perhaps using the method to find another root, maybe the smallest or a specific one. Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.

Alternatively, perhaps the equation provided is incorrect, or maybe I misapplied the method. Let me double-check my calculations.

Wait, I think I made a mistake in the synthetic division. Let me redo that. The coefficients are 1, -11, 32, -22.

Bring down the 1.

Multiply 1 by 1 (the root) gives 1. Add to -11: -10.

Multiply -10 by 1: -10. Add to 32: 22.

Multiply 22 by 1:22. Add to -22: 0. So the division is correct, and the quadratic is x² -10x + 22.

So the roots are 1, and 5±sqrt(3). So 5 - sqrt(3) is approximately 5 - 1.732 = 3.268, and 5 + sqrt(3) is about 6.732.

Looking at the options, the only root present is 1 (option C). So why are we asked to use the Birge-Vieta method? Maybe the problem intended to use a different equation, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the method.

Alternatively, perhaps the equation is different, but in this case, x=1 is a root. So perhaps the correct answer is C:1.

Wait, but the problem states to use the Birge-Vieta method with p=0.5 to find a real root correct to three decimals. So maybe I should proceed with that method.

I think the Birge-Vieta method is a root-finding technique that uses a parameter p. It might be a modified version of the Newton-Raphson method. Alternatively, perhaps it's a method that uses a linear combination of the function and its derivatives.

Wait, perhaps it's the same as the Newton-Raphson method but with some adjustment using the parameter p. Alternatively, maybe it's a secant method variant.

Alternatively, perhaps it's the method of false position, which uses a parameter to control the step size.

Alternatively, maybe it's a different approach. Let me try to look up the Birge-Vieta method in my mind. Hmm, I'm not recalling it clearly. So perhaps it's better to proceed with the Newton-Raphson method, using p as a parameter, or perhaps it's a way to adjust the initial guess.

Wait, but the equation is x³ -11x² +32x -22 =0, and we know x=1 is a root. So if I'm to use the Birge-Vieta method, perhaps I can apply it to find another root, but since the options don't include 3.268 or 6.732, perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the Birge-Vieta method to find a root near a certain starting point. Let's say I start with an initial guess and use p=0.5.

Wait, but I think I'm getting stuck. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to note that x=1 is a root and hence the answer is C:1.

But let me think again: the problem asks to use the Birge-Vieta method with p=0.5 to find a real root correct to three decimals. So perhaps the root is x=1, which is already exact, so correct to three decimals would be 1.000, which is option C.

Alternatively, perhaps the equation is mistyped, but given that x=1 is a root, and it's one of the options, perhaps that's the answer.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Let me check the equation again: x³ -11x² +32x -22=0. Plugging x=1: 1 -11 +32 -22 = (1-11) + (32-22) = (-10) +10 =0. So yes, x=1 is a root.

Therefore, the correct answer is C:1.
</think>

The equation x³ -11x² +32x -22 = 0 has x=1 as a root, which is confirmed by substituting and performing synthetic division. The Birge-Vieta method is not necessary here since x=1 is already an exact root. Thus, the correct answer is C:1.

Answer: C
