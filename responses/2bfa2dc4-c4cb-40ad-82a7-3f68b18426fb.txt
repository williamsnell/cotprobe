Okay, so I've got this problem about a dipole antenna and its operating frequency. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question says the antenna is placed 2 meters above the Earth's surface and that it's one-quarter of a wavelength above the surface. I need to find its operating frequency from the given options.

Wait, wait, I think I remember something about antenna height and wavelength. Oh right, the height of the antenna above the ground affects the wavelength. But wait, the problem says the antenna is placed one-quarter of a wavelength above the earth's surface. So the height (h) is λ/4. Given that h is 2 meters, so λ/4 = 2m. That means the wavelength λ is 4 * 2m = 8 meters. Okay, that makes sense.

Now, the relationship between wavelength (λ), frequency (f), and the speed of light (c) is given by the formula c = λ * f. I know the speed of light in a vacuum is approximately 3 x 10^8 meters per second. So rearranging the formula, f = c / λ.

Plugging in the numbers: f = (3e8 m/s) / 8 m. Let's calculate that. 3e8 divided by 8 is 37.5 million Hertz, or 37.5 MHz.

Looking at the options, option H is 37.5MHz. So I think that's the answer. Let me just double-check. Yes, if λ is 8 meters, then frequency is 3e8 /8 = 37.5e6 Hz, which is 37.5 MHz. Yep, that's correct.

The antenna is placed at a height of 2 meters, which is one-quarter of the wavelength. Therefore, the wavelength \( \lambda \) is \( 4 \times 2 = 8 \) meters. Using the formula \( c = \lambda \times f \), where \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), the frequency \( f \) is calculated as \( f = \frac{3 \times 10^8}{8} = 37.5 \, \text{MHz} \).

**Answer: H**
