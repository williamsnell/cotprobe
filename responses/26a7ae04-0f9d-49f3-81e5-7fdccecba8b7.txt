Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the standard Gibbs free-energy change for a reaction. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it step by step. 

The reaction given is CH4(g) + H2O(g) ⇌ CO(g) + 3H2(g) at 25°C. The data provided includes the standard enthalpy (ΔH) and entropy (ΔS) values for each substance at 298 K. The question is asking for the standard Gibbs free energy change (ΔG°) for this reaction.

First, I remember that Gibbs free energy change is calculated using the equation:

ΔG° = ΔH° - TΔS°

But wait, I need to make sure I'm using the correct values. Both ΔH and ΔS are given at 298 K, which is standard temperature, so that's good because the reaction is at 25°C, which is 298 K. So I don't need to adjust for temperature here.

Next, I need to calculate the ΔH° and ΔS° for the reaction by using the standard values of each substance. 

For ΔH°, I'll do a Hess's Law approach, where I sum the ΔHf° of the products and subtract the sum of the reactants. 

Looking at the data:

CH4(g): ΔH = -17.89 kcal/mol
H2O(g): ΔH = -57.80 kcal/mol
CO(g): ΔH = -26.40 kcal/mol
H2(g): ΔH = 0 kcal/mol (since it's an element in its standard state)

The reaction produces 1 mole of CO and 3 moles of H2. So the products' ΔH is:

CO: 1 * (-26.40) = -26.40
H2: 3 * 0 = 0
Total for products = -26.40 + 0 = -26.40

The reactants are 1 mole of CH4 and 1 mole of H2O, so:

CH4: 1 * (-17.89) = -17.89
H2O: 1 * (-57.80) = -57.80
Total for reactants = (-17.89) + (-57.80) = -75.69

Now, ΔH° for the reaction is products minus reactants:

ΔH° = (-26.40) - (-75.69) = (-26.40) +75.69 = 49.29 kcal/mol

Wait, that seems right. So ΔH° is +49.29 kcal/mol.

Next, for ΔS°, I'll do the same. Sum the S values of the products and subtract the sum of the reactants.

The entropy data:

CH4(g): 44.5 cal/(°mol)
H2O(g): 45.1 cal/(°mol)
CO(g): 47.3 cal/(°mol)
H2(g): 31.2 cal/(°mol)

Products:
CO: 1 * 47.3 = 47.3
H2: 3 * 31.2 = 93.6
Total products = 47.3 + 93.6 = 140.9

Reactants:
CH4: 1 * 44.5 = 44.5
H2O: 1 *45.1 =45.1
Total reactants = 44.5 +45.1 = 89.6

ΔS° = products - reactants = 140.9 -89.6 = 51.3 cal/(°mol)

Wait, that's 51.3 cal/(°mol). Now, since the equation uses ΔS in kcal, I need to convert this to kcal. There are 1000 calories in a kcal, so 51.3 cal/(°mol) is 0.0513 kcal/(°mol).

Wait, no, wait. Wait. Let me double-check the units. The ΔS is given in cal/(°mol), and the calculation is in cal/(mol·K), since entropy is usually in J/(mol·K) or cal/(mol·°F), but I think in this case it's cal/(mol·°C). Oh, but wait, the question says cal/deg^-1 mole^-1, which is cal/(°C·mol). Since 1°C change is the same as 1 K change, so it's fine.

But the Gibbs equation uses ΔS in the same units as ΔH. Since ΔH is in kcal/mol, I need to convert the entropy change from cal/(mol·K) to kcal/(mol·K).

So ΔS° = 51.3 cal/(mol·K) = 0.0513 kcal/(mol·K)

Now, the temperature is 298 K. So TΔS° = 298 K * 0.0513 kcal/(mol·K) = let's calculate that.

298 * 0.0513 = let me compute that. 298 * 0.05 is 14.9, and 298 * 0.0013 is about 0.3874. So adding together, approximately 15.2874 kcal/mol.

Wait, let me do it more accurately: 0.0513 * 300 would be 15.39, but since it's 298, it's a bit less. 298 * 0.0513 = 298 * (51.3/1000) = (298 *51.3)/1000.

Calculating 298 *51.3: 300*51.3 = 15,390, so subtract 2*51.3=102.6 → 15,390 - 102.6 = 15,287.4. Then divide by 1000: 15.2874 kcal/mol.

So TΔS° = approximately 15.2874 kcal/mol.

Now, putting it all into the Gibbs equation:

ΔG° = ΔH° - TΔS° = 49.29 kcal/mol - 15.2874 kcal/mol.

Subtracting these: 49.29 -15.2874 = 34.0026 kcal/mol.

Hmm, that's about 34 kcal/mol. Looking at the options, option A is 34 kcal/mole. So the answer should be A.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

ΔH° calculation: products' ΔH - reactants' ΔH.

Products: CO = -26.40, H2 = 0. So sum is -26.40.

Reactants: CH4 = -17.89, H2O = -57.80. Sum is -75.69.

ΔH° = (-26.40) - (-75.69) = 49.29. Correct.

ΔS°: products = 47.3 +3*31.2 =47.3 +93.6=140.9.

Reactants:44.5 +45.1=89.6. So ΔS =140.9-89.6=51.3 cal/mol·K.

Convert to kcal: 51.3 cal = 0.0513 kcal. So TΔS =298 *0.0513=15.2874.

ΔG°=49.29 -15.2874=34.0026. So about 34 kcal/mol. So yeah, option A is correct.

To calculate the standard Gibbs free-energy change (ΔG°) for the reaction CH₄(g) + H₂O(g) ⇌ CO(g) + 3H₂(g) at 25°C (298 K), we use the equation:

\[
\Delta G^\circ = \Delta H^\circ - T\Delta S^\circ
\]

### Step 1: Calculate ΔH°
Using Hess's Law:
\[
\Delta H^\circ = \text{(Sum of } \Delta H_f^\circ \text{ of products)} - \text{(Sum of } \Delta H_f^\circ \text{ of reactants)}
\]

From the data:
- Reactants: CH₄(g): -17.89 kcal/mol, H₂O(g): -57.80 kcal/mol  
  Total reactants: \(-17.89 + (-57.80) = -75.69\) kcal/mol  
- Products: CO(g): -26.40 kcal/mol, H₂(g): 0 kcal/mol (3 moles)  
  Total products: \(-26.40 + 0 = -26.40\) kcal/mol  

\[
\Delta H^\circ = (-26.40) - (-75.69) = 49.29 \, \text{kcal/mol}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate ΔS°
\[
\Delta S^\circ = \text{(Sum of } S^\circ \text{ of products)} - \text{(Sum of } S^\circ \text{ of reactants)}
\]

From the data:
- Reactants: CH₄(g): 44.5 cal/(mol·°C), H₂O(g): 45.1 cal/(mol·°C)  
  Total reactants: \(44.5 + 45.1 = 89.6\) cal/(mol·°C)  
- Products: CO(g): 47.3 cal/(mol·°C), H₂(g): 31.2 cal/(mol·°C) (3 moles)  
  Total products: \(47.3 + (3 \times 31.2) = 140.9\) cal/(mol·°C)  

\[
\Delta S^\circ = 140.9 - 89.6 = 51.3 \, \text{cal/(mol·°C)} = 0.0513 \, \text{kcal/(mol·K)}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate TΔS°
\[
T\Delta S^\circ = 298 \, \text{K} \times 0.0513 \, \text{kcal/(mol·K)} = 15.2874 \, \text{kcal/mol}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate ΔG°
\[
\Delta G^\circ = \Delta H^\circ - T\Delta S^\circ = 49.29 \, \text{kcal/mol} - 15.2874 \, \text{kcal/mol} = 34.0026 \, \text{kcal/mol}
\]

### Final Answer:
The standard Gibbs free-energy change for the reaction is approximately **34 kcal/mol**, which corresponds to option **A**.
