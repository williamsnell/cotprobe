Okay, so I've got this math problem here about golf balls and figuring out the cost for a different quantity. Let me try to break it down step by step.

Alright, the problem says that a bucket of 40 golf balls costs $4.00. They want to know how much a bucket of 100 golf balls would cost at the same rate. Hmm, I think I need to find the price per golf ball first and then apply that to 100 balls. Or maybe there's a simpler way without calculating each individual price.

Wait, maybe I can think in terms of ratios or proportions. If 40 balls cost $4, then how much does 100 cost? So, I can set up a proportion where 40 is to $4 as 100 is to x. That would be 40/4 = 100/x, but wait, actually, it's the other way around because the number of balls increases, so the cost should increase proportionally.

Wait, no, actually, the ratio should be consistent. So, 40 balls cost $4, so for 100 balls, it's (4 dollars / 40 balls) * 100 balls. Let me write that down: (4 / 40) * 100.

Calculating that, 4 divided by 40 is 0.1. Then, 0.1 times 100 is 10. So, $10.00. That seems straightforward. Let me check if I did that right.

Alternatively, I could calculate the price per ball first. $4 for 40 balls means each ball is 4/40 = $0.10. So, each ball is 10 cents. Then, 100 balls would be 100 * 0.10 = $10.00. Yep, same answer. That makes sense.

Looking at the options, option E is $10.00. That should be the correct answer. I don't think there's any trick here; it's just a simple proportion or unit price calculation.

The cost per golf ball is $0.10, so 100 balls cost $10.00.

Answer: E
