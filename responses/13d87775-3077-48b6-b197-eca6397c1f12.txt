Question:

One of the major atmospheric pollutants emitted by fuel combustion power stations is a sulfur oxide mixture general-ly designated as S0_x. It consists mainly of SO_2 but may contain anywhere from 1 to 10% SO_3 computed as percent by weight of the total mass. What would be the approximate range to assign to x?

Options:

A: x = 2.01
B: x = 3.14/1.56
C: x = 1.56/3.14
D: x = 1.25 × 10^-2

Answer:
    
<think>
Okay, so I've got this question about atmospheric pollutants from fuel combustion power stations. The question is about sulfur oxide mixtures, specifically S0_x. Hmm, I remember that SO_x usually refers to a mix of sulfur dioxide (SO2) and sulfur trioxide (SO3). The question says that the mixture mainly consists of SO2 but may have between 1 to 10% SO3 by weight.

Wait, the problem is asking about the value of x. So SO0_x would be like SOx, right? But in reality, the main components are SO2 and SO3. So x would vary depending on the composition of the mixture.

Let me think. The mixture is mostly SO2, so the average x would be closer to 2. But since there's also some SO3, which has x=3, the overall x should be somewhere between 2 and 3. Because SO3 contributes more per molecule, but in terms of weight percent, the question says 1-10% of the total mass is SO3.

Wait, actually, the question says the mixture is mainly SO2, but the SO3 is 1-10% by weight. So let's model this.

Suppose we have a certain amount of SO2 and SO3. Let's say the total mass is M. SO2 is 90-99% of M, and SO3 is 1-10%.

The formula for the average x would be based on the molar masses. Let's calculate the molar mass of SO2 and SO3.

Molar mass of SO2: S is about 32.07 g/mol, O is 16.00. So 32.07 + 2*16 = 64.07 g/mol.

Molar mass of SO3: 32.07 + 3*16 = 64.07 +16 = 80.07 g/mol? Wait, no: wait, 32.07 + (3*16) = 32.07 +48 = 80.07 g/mol.

Wait, actually, no: wait, SO3 is S (32.07) + 3 O (16 each), so 32.07 + 48 = 80.07 g/mol.

Now, let's say the mass of SO2 is 99% (minimum contribution from SO3 is 1%, so maximum SO2 is 99%), and SO3 is 1% (minimum, but let's see both extremes).

But wait, the problem states that SO3 is 1 to 10% of the total mass. So SO2 is 90-99% by mass, and SO3 is 1-10%.

We need to find the average x, which is the average oxidation state based on the mixture. Alternatively, perhaps x is the average based on moles, not mass. Wait, no, the problem says it's computed as percent by weight, so mass percentage.

Wait, but x is a subscript in SOx. So the formula would be an average based on the molar proportions. Because each molecule contributes its x, but the overall x would depend on the mole fraction.

Wait, no. Let me clarify. The mixture is a combination of SO2 and SO3. The overall formula would be something like S O_x, where x is the average oxidation state based on the mole fractions of SO2 and SO3.

Wait, perhaps x is calculated as (moles of SO2 * 2 + moles of SO3 *3) / total moles.

Since the question is about the approximate range of x, given that SO3 is up to 10% by mass, let's find the maximum and minimum possible x.

Let me take two cases:

Case 1: SO3 is 10% of the total mass, SO2 is 90%.

Case 2: SO3 is 1% of the mass, SO2 is 99%.

For each case, calculate the mole fraction of SO2 and SO3, then compute x.

Let me compute for Case 1: 10% SO3, 90% SO2.

Mass of SO2 = 0.9 * M, where M is total mass.

Moles of SO2 = (0.9 M) / (64.07 g/mol)

Moles of SO3 = (0.1 M) / (80.07 g/mol)

Total moles = moles of SO2 + moles of SO3.

x = (2 * moles SO2 + 3 * moles SO3) / (moles SO2 + moles SO3)

Let me compute the numbers.

Moles SO2 = 0.9M /64.07 ≈ (0.9 /64.07) M ≈ 0.014045 M

Moles SO3 = 0.1M /80.07 ≈ (0.1 /80.07) M ≈ 0.001249 M

Total moles = 0.014045 + 0.001249 ≈ 0.015294 M

Numerator: 2*(0.014045) + 3*(0.001249) = 0.02809 + 0.003747 ≈ 0.031837

Denominator: 0.015294

x ≈ 0.031837 / 0.015294 ≈ 2.08

Wait, that's around 2.08. So in this case, x is about 2.08.

Now, for Case 2: SO3 is 1% (0.01), SO2 is 99% (0.99).

Moles SO2 = 0.99M /64.07 ≈ 0.01542 M

Moles SO3 = 0.01M /80.07 ≈ 0.0001249 M

Total moles ≈ 0.01542 + 0.0001249 ≈ 0.015545

Numerator: 2*(0.01542) + 3*(0.0001249) ≈ 0.03084 + 0.0003747 ≈ 0.031215

Denominator: 0.015545

x ≈ 0.031215 / 0.015545 ≈ 2.01

So when SO3 is 1%, x is about 2.01, and when it's 10%, x is about 2.08.

So the range of x would be approximately between 2.01 and 2.08.

Looking at the options, option A is x=2.01, which would be the lower end. But the question asks for the approximate range. The options don't list a range, but the choices are A: 2.01, B: 3.14/1.56 (which is about 2?), C: 1.56/3.14 (which is about 0.5?), D: 1.25e-2 (which is 0.0125, way too low).

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check the calculation again.

Wait, wait, when SO3 is 10%:

Moles SO2: 0.9M /64.07 = approximately 0.014045 M

Moles SO3: 0.1M /80.07 ≈ 0.001249 M

So numerator: 2*0.014045 = 0.02809; 3*0.001249 ≈ 0.003747 → total ≈ 0.031837

Denominator: 0.014045 + 0.001249 ≈ 0.015294

x ≈ 0.031837 / 0.015294 ≈ 2.08

Similarly, for 1%:

Moles SO2: 0.99M /64.07 ≈ 0.01542 M

Moles SO3: 0.01M /80.07 ≈ 0.0001249 M

Numerator: 2*0.01542 ≈ 0.03084; 3*0.0001249 ≈ 0.0003747 → total ≈ 0.031215

Denominator: 0.01542 + 0.0001249 ≈ 0.015545

x ≈ 0.031215 / 0.015545 ≈ 2.01

So x ranges from approximately 2.01 to 2.08.

Looking at the options, option A is x=2.01, which would be the minimum x. But the question is about the range, so perhaps the correct answer is that x is around 2.0 to 2.1. But the options don't provide a range, so the options given are single values.

Wait, looking again at the options:

A: x = 2.01

B: x = 3.14/1.56 → about 2.01 (since 3.14 divided by 1.56 is approximately 2.01)

Wait, 3.14 / 1.56 → Let me compute that: 3.14 ÷ 1.56 ≈ 2.0128, so around 2.01.

C: x = 1.56/3.14 → about 0.4968, which is much lower.

D: 1.25 × 10^-2 → 0.0125, which is too low.

So option B is x ≈ 2.01, same as option A. Wait, but option A is x=2.01, and option B is 3.14/1.56 ≈ 2.01.

Wait, but the question says "the approximate range to assign to x". So perhaps the correct answer would be that x is between approximately 2 and 3, but the options don't have that. Alternatively, perhaps the options are considering the average.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The main point is that the mixture is mostly SO2 (x=2) with a little SO3 (x=3), so x would be just above 2, around 2.01 to 2.08, as we calculated.

Looking at the options, A is x=2.01, which is the minimum value of x when SO3 is at 1%. So the approximate range would be from 2.01 to about 2.08. Since the options don't provide a range but single values, perhaps the answer is A: 2.01, as it's the lower end, but the question asks for the range. Alternatively, perhaps the options are considering that x is approximately 2, so option A is the best fit.

Wait, but the options are A: 2.01; B: 2.01; because 3.14/1.56 is approximately 2.01. So both A and B are same? Or perhaps I'm making a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should think differently. The problem is about x in the formula S0_x. Wait, no, S0_x is a notation, perhaps meaning SOx. So the formula is SOx, where x is the average oxidation state.

In the mixture, the average x would be between 2 and 3, but closer to 2 because SO2 is dominant.

Wait, but the options don't have 2, but option A is 2.01, which is very close to 2, and option B is 3.14/1.56≈2.01 as well.

Wait, perhaps the options are trying to express fractions. Let me think: 3.14 over 1.56 is approximately 2. So maybe option B is 2.01, similar to option A.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to realize that the average x is just over 2, so the closest option is A: 2.01.

But wait, the initial calculation when SO3 is 10% gives x ≈2.08, which is about 2.1, and when SO3 is 1%, x is around 2.01. So the range is from 2.01 to about 2.08.

Looking at the options again, none of the options except A and B are around 2.01, but they're expressed as exact numbers. Since the question asks for the approximate range, perhaps the answer is that x is around 2.0, so the closest option is A: 2.01.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the average x is approximately 2, so x≈2, which would make option A (2.01) the correct choice.

The question involves determining the approximate range of x in the sulfur oxide mixture S0_x, which primarily consists of SO₂ (x=2) with a minor contribution from SO₃ (x=3). The SO₃ content is given as 1-10% by weight, meaning SO₂ constitutes 90-99% of the total mass.

To calculate x, the average oxidation state, we consider the mole fractions of SO₂ and SO₃. The molar masses of SO₂ (64.07 g/mol) and SO₃ (80.07 g/mol) are used to compute the moles of each component. The average x is then calculated as:

\[
x = \frac{2 \cdot \text{moles of SO}_2 + 3 \cdot \text{moles of SO}_3}{\text{total moles}}
\]

For the extreme cases:
1. **1% SO₃ (99% SO₂):**
   - Moles of SO₂ ≈ 0.01542 M, moles of SO₃ ≈ 0.0001249 M.
   - \( x \approx 2.01 \).

2. **10% SO₃ (90% SO₂):**
   - Moles of SO₂ ≈ 0.014045 M, moles of SO₃ ≈ 0.001249 M.
   - \( x \approx 2.08 \).

Thus, the range of x is approximately **2.01 to 2.08**. Among the options, **A: x = 2.01** corresponds to the lower end of this range, making it the best choice.
