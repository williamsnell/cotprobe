Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this VAR model question about bi-directional feedback. I remember that in VAR models, bi-directional feedback means there's causality in both directions between variables. That usually involves certain coefficients being significant.

Wait, the question is asking which conditions must hold for bi-directional feedback. I think bi-directional feedback implies that each variable affects the other. So in a two-variable VAR model, let's say we have variables Y and Z. The model would have lags of both Y and Z.

In equation form, maybe it's something like Y_t = a Y_{t-1} + b Z_{t-1} + error, and Z_t = c Y_{t-1} + d Z_{t-1} + error. Or maybe it's a different setup, but I think the idea is that for feedback, each variable must have a significant coefficient on the other variable's lag.

So for Y to affect Z, the coefficient c (on Y's lag in Z's equation) needs to be significant. And for Z to affect Y, the coefficient b (on Z's lag in Y's equation) needs to be significant. So both b and d? Wait, no, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, if it's a VAR model with two variables, Y and Z, each equation would include lags of both variables. So for Y, the equation would be Y_t = a Y_{t-1} + b Z_{t-1} + error. For Z, it would be Z_t = c Y_{t-1} + d Z_{t-1} + error. 

For there to be a feedback, each variable must influence the other. That means in Y's equation, the coefficient b (on Z's lag) must be significant, indicating that past Z affects Y. And in Z's equation, the coefficient c (on Y's lag) must be significant, indicating past Y affects Z. So both b and c need to be significant.

Looking at the options, which ones require both b and c to be significant? Let's check each option.

Option A: a, b, c significant. Hmm, not sure about a and c. Wait, a is the coefficient on Y's own lag in Y's equation. So maybe a being significant just means Y has an autoregressive effect, but that's not about feedback. So A includes b and c, which is good, but also a, which may not be necessary for feedback.

Option B: a and c significant. Wait, that's only a and c. But feedback requires both b and c. So B is lacking b, so probably wrong.

Option C: a, b, d. So a is Y's own lag, b is Z's lag in Y's equation, d is Z's own lag in Z's equation. So this includes b (which is good for Y affecting Z) and d (Z's own lag, not about feedback). But where's c? The c coefficient is the one that matters for Y's lag in Z's equation. So if c isn't significant, then Z doesn't depend on Y, so no feedback. So C is wrong.

Option D: b and d significant. So b is in Y's equation, which is good for Y affecting Z. d is in Z's equation, which is Z's own lag. But d doesn't imply feedback; feedback requires that Z's equation has a significant c (Y's lag). So D is missing c, so no.

Option E: a, d, c. So a is Y's own lag, d is Z's own lag, and c is Y's lag in Z's equation. So this includes c (so Z depends on Y) but what about b? If b isn't significant, then Y doesn't depend on Z, so no feedback. So E is missing b, so no.

Option F: a and c significant, and b and d insignificant. That means in Y's equation, a is Y's own lag (maybe significant), c is Y's effect on Z's equation. But b is insignificant, so Z's lag doesn't affect Y, meaning no feedback from Z to Y. So F is the opposite of what we want.

Option G: b and d significant, a and c insignificant. So b is significant in Y's equation (Z affects Y), d is in Z's equation (Z's own lag, which doesn't imply feedback). But if c is insignificant, then Y's lag doesn't affect Z. So G would mean Y affects Z only if c is significant, which it isn't here. So G is incorrect.

Option H: a and d significant, b and c insignificant. So a is Y's own lag, d is Z's own lag. But neither b nor c are significant, so no feedback between Y and Z. So H is wrong.

Option I: b, c, d significant. So b is Z's effect on Y, c is Y's effect on Z, and d is Z's own lag. So this includes both b and c, which are necessary for feedback. But what about a? a's significance doesn't matter for feedback, so I think I is a possibility if the other conditions are met. Wait, but the question is which conditions must hold. So I includes b and c, which is good.

Option J: b and c significant, a and d insignificant. So b is Z affecting Y, c is Y affecting Z. That's exactly what we need for bi-directional feedback. So J seems correct because both b and c are significant, regardless of a and d.

Wait, but in the VAR setup, the model usually includes lagged terms of both variables. So if in Y's equation, the coefficient on Z's lag (b) is significant, and in Z's equation, the coefficient on Y's lag (c) is significant, then we have feedback. So the correct option should require both b and c to be significant.

Looking back, option J says b and c significant, and a and d insignificant. But does it matter if a and d are significant? No, because a is Y's own lag in Y's equation, and d is Z's own lag in Z's equation. Their significance affects the model's stability and perhaps Granger causality, but feedback is about the cross coefficients.

So the necessary conditions are that b and c are significant. Looking at the options, option J specifies that b and c are significant and a and d are not. But wait, the question is about what conditions must hold for feedback. It doesn't say anything about the other coefficients needing to be insignificant. So perhaps the correct answer is when both b and c are significant, regardless of a and d.

Wait, but looking at the options again, option I is b, c, d significant. So that includes b and c, which is good. But the question is which condition must hold. So the minimal condition is that b and c are significant. So any option that requires b and c to be significant is a candidate.

Option I says b, c, d significant. So if d is also significant, that's okay, but the key is b and c. But the question is which condition must hold. So perhaps the correct answer is J, because it requires b and c to be significant, but the other coefficients (a and d) can be anything, but in J, they are insignificant.

Wait, no, the question is which conditions must hold. So the necessary conditions are that b and c are significant. The other coefficients (a and d) don't affect the feedback; they affect the model's dynamics but not the feedback between variables.

So looking back, the options:

Option J: The b and c coefficients significant and the a and d coefficients insignificant.

But the question is, which conditions must hold. So the key is that b and c must be significant. The other coefficients (a and d) can be anything, but the option J says a and d are insignificant. So the correct conditions are that b and c are significant, regardless of a and d. But none of the options directly say that. Let me check again.

Wait, the options are:

A: a, b, c significant.

B: a and c significant.

C: a, b, d.

D: b and d.

E: a, d, c.

F: a and c significant, b and d not.

G: b and d, a and c not.

H: a and d, b and c not.

I: b, c, d.

J: b and c, a and d not.

So the correct answer must be that both b and c are significant. So the options that require both b and c are I and J. But I also requires d to be significant, which isn't necessary. So the minimal condition is that b and c are significant, regardless of a and d. But in the options, J requires that b and c are significant and a and d are not. But the question is about what must hold, not what is sufficient. So the necessary conditions are that b and c are significant. But looking at the options, only J and I include both b and c.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The necessary condition for bi-directional feedback is that in the VAR equations, each variable has a significant coefficient on the other variable's lag. So in Y's equation, the coefficient on Z's lag (b) must be significant, and in Z's equation, the coefficient on Y's lag (c) must be significant. So the answer should be an option where both b and c are significant.

Looking at the options again:

Option I: b, c, d significant.

Option J: b and c significant, a and d not.

So both I and J have b and c significant. But the question is, which condition must hold. So the minimal condition is that b and c are significant. So any option that requires b and c to be significant is correct. But looking at the options, J is the only one that specifically requires b and c to be significant, but it also specifies that a and d are insignificant. However, the question is about what must hold, not what is the case when other coefficients are not significant.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. The question is which conditions must hold for bi-directional feedback. So the necessary conditions are that both b and c are significant. So the correct answer would be an option that includes both b and c being significant, regardless of a and d. But looking at the options, only I and J include both b and c.

But I also includes d being significant, which might not be necessary. So perhaps the answer is J, because it specifies that b and c are significant. Alternatively, maybe I is correct because it includes b, c, and d. But I'm not sure.

Wait, in the VAR model, for feedback, the presence of significant coefficients on the other variable's lags is sufficient. The coefficients on the own lags (a and d) don't affect the feedback; they just affect the model's stability. So the correct conditions are that b and c are significant. So looking at the options, the correct answer is the option that requires both b and c to be significant.

So the options are:

I: b, c, d significant.

J: b and c significant, a and d insignificant.

So the correct answer is the one that requires b and c to be significant. So between I and J, which one is correct? The question is about what must hold, so perhaps I is incorrect because it requires d to be significant, which isn't necessary. So the correct answer is J, because it requires b and c to be significant, regardless of a and d. Wait, no, J says a and d are insignificant, which isn't a necessary condition. The necessary condition is only that b and c are significant. But none of the options directly say that. So perhaps the answer is I, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The correct conditions for bi-directional feedback are that in each equation, the coefficient on the other variable's lag is significant. So in Y's equation, b must be significant, and in Z's equation, c must be significant. So the answer is the option that requires both b and c to be significant. Looking at the options, that's I and J. But I also requires d to be significant, which isn't necessary. So perhaps the correct answer is J, but I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is that both b and c must be significant, regardless of a and d. But looking at the options, the only options that require both b and c are I and J. So perhaps the correct answer is I, but I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is J, because it's the only option that requires both b and c to be significant, and the other coefficients can be anything, but in J they are specified as insignificant.

Wait, I think I'm getting stuck. Let me try a different approach. In a VAR model, Granger causality tests are used to check for feedback. For bi-directional feedback, both variables must Granger-cause each other. That requires that in each equation, the coefficient on the other variable's lag is significant. So in Y's equation, b must be significant, and in Z's equation, c must be significant. So the correct condition is that both b and c are significant. So the answer is the option that requires both b and c to be significant.

Looking at the options again:

I: b, c, d significant.

J: b and c significant, a and d insignificant.

So both I and J have b and c significant. But I also requires d to be significant, which isn't necessary for feedback. So the minimal condition is that b and c are significant. Therefore, the correct answer is the option that requires both b and c to be significant, which is I and J. But since the question is about what must hold, and the other coefficients (a and d) don't affect the feedback, the correct answer is the one that requires only b and c to be significant. But looking at the options, only J specifies that b and c are significant and the others are not. So perhaps the answer is J.

Wait, no, the question is about what must hold for feedback. So feedback requires that b and c are significant. It doesn't require anything about a and d. So the correct answer is the option that requires b and c to be significant, regardless of a and d. But looking at the options, the only options that require both b and c are I and J. However, I also requires d to be significant, which isn't necessary. So perhaps the correct answer is J, but I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is I, but I'm not confident. Wait, perhaps the answer is D, but no, D is b and d. That's not right.

Wait, perhaps I'm making this more complicated than it is. The key is that for feedback, both cross coefficients must be significant. So the answer is the option that requires both b and c to be significant. Looking back, the only options that do this are I and J. But the correct answer is J because it specifically requires b and c to be significant, and the others can be insignificant. So the answer is J.

For bi-directional feedback in a VAR model, it is necessary that each variable has a significant impact on the other. This means that the coefficients representing the lagged effects of one variable on the other must be significant. Specifically, in the equations for the two variables, the coefficient on the lagged other variable must be significant. 

In the context of the VAR model:

- For variable Y, the coefficient on Z's lag (denoted as **b**) must be significant.
- For variable Z, the coefficient on Y's lag (denoted as **c**) must be significant.

The coefficients on the variables' own lags (denoted as **a** and **d**) are not directly relevant to the feedback between the variables, as they only affect the model's stability and dynamics, not the feedback itself.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option I**: Requires **b**, **c**, and **d** to be significant. While **b** and **c** are necessary for feedback, the significance of **d** is not required, making this option incorrect.
- **Option J**: Requires **b** and **c** to be significant, with **a** and **d** being insignificant. This correctly identifies the necessary conditions for feedback, as **b** and **c** are the critical coefficients for bi-directional feedback.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option J**, as it accurately specifies the necessary conditions for bi-directional feedback in the VAR model.

**Answer: J**
