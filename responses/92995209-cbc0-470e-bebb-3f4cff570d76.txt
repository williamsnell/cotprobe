Question:

Match Co. manufactures a product with the following costs per unit based on a maximum plant capacity of 400000 units per year: Direct materials $ 60 Direct labor 10 Variable overhead 40 Fixed overhead 30 Total $140 Match has a ready market for all 400000 units at a selling price of $200 each. Selling costs in this market consist of $10 per unit shipping and a fixed licensing fee of $50000 per year. Reno Co. wishes to buy 5000 of these units on a special order. There would be no shipping costs on this special order. What is the lowest price per unit at which Match should be willing to sell the 5000 units to Reno?

Options:

A: $160
B: $110
C: $190
D: $180
E: $230
F: 200
G: $240
H: $220
I: $210
J: $140

Answer:
    
<think>
Okay, so I've got this problem about Match Co. and Reno Co. I need to figure out the lowest price per unit that Match should sell to Reno for 5000 units. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I'll read the question again carefully to make sure I understand all the details. Match Co. makes a product with certain costs per unit when they're making up to 400,000 units a year. The costs are: Direct materials $60, Direct labor $10, Variable overhead $40, and Fixed overhead $30. So the total cost per unit is $60 + $10 + $40 + $30 = $140.

They can sell all 400,000 units in the regular market at $200 each. But there are some selling costs: $10 per unit for shipping and a fixed licensing fee of $50,000 per year. Now, Reno Co. wants to buy 5,000 units, but this is a special order with no shipping costs. I need to find the lowest price per unit Match should be willing to accept.

Hmm, so I think this is a special order pricing question. I remember that when dealing with special orders, you should consider the incremental costs, meaning the costs that would be incurred because of this order. Also, if the company has excess capacity, fixed costs might not be affected.

Wait, Match's maximum plant capacity is 400,000 units, and they're already selling all of them. So if Reno wants 5,000 units, does that mean Match isn't at full capacity? Or is the 5,000 an additional amount beyond their current production? Wait, the problem says Match has a ready market for all 400,000 units. So if they're already selling all they can make, accepting a special order of 5,000 would require increasing production beyond 400,000, which they can't do because that's their maximum. Or maybe I'm misunderstanding. Wait, maybe the 5,000 is within the 400,000 capacity? Let me think: 400,000 is the maximum, so they can make 400,000 units. If they're already selling all 400,000, then taking on 5,000 more isn't possible. Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, maybe the 5,000 units are within the 400,000, meaning they're not at full capacity yet. Or perhaps they're already at full capacity, so the special order would need to displace some existing sales. Hmm, that's a possibility. Alternatively, maybe the special order is for units that Match isn't currently selling, but I think the key is whether the company has the capacity to produce more.

Wait, the problem says Match has a ready market for all 400,000 units, so they're selling all they can make. So if they accept the special order, they might have to forgo some regular sales. But wait, Reno is buying 5,000 units, which is less than 400,000, but maybe they can make more. Wait, no, the maximum is 400,000 units. So if they're already selling 400,000, they can't make more unless they increase capacity, which they can't because the maximum is 400,000. So perhaps the 5,000 units would have to come from reducing regular production, meaning they have to give up selling 5,000 units at the regular price to fulfill Reno's order.

Wait, but that might not be the case. Let me think again. Maybe the 5,000 is an additional order beyond their current 400,000 units. But the problem states the maximum is 400,000, so they can't make more than that. Therefore, the 5,000 units must be part of the 400,000. So perhaps they're not yet at full capacity. Wait, the problem says "based on a maximum plant capacity of 400,000 units per year." So if Match isn't currently selling all 400,000, perhaps they have excess capacity. But the question says they have a ready market for all 400,000, so they are at full capacity. Therefore, accepting a special order would require that they can't produce more than 400,000, so they have to find a way to make the 5,000 units without affecting their regular production.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's approach this step by step.

First, calculate the cost per unit for Match. The total cost per unit is $140, as given. Now, in the regular market, they sell each unit for $200, which includes the selling costs of $10 per unit and a fixed licensing fee of $50,000 per year. So, to find the contribution margin for regular sales, we need to subtract the variable costs from the selling price. Wait, but the costs given are all per unit, including fixed overhead. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of contribution margin for the special order. Since Reno's order has no shipping costs, we can save on that expense. Also, the fixed licensing fee is a fixed cost, so it's already being covered by the regular sales. Therefore, for the special order, we don't need to include the fixed fee again because it's a sunk cost.

So, for the special order, the relevant costs are the variable costs per unit. Let's list out the costs:

- Direct materials: $60
- Direct labor: $10
- Variable overhead: $40
- Fixed overhead: $30 (but since this is fixed, it's already covered whether they make 400,000 units or 405,000, so it's a sunk cost. So perhaps we don't include it in the special order cost calculation.)

Wait, but if the fixed overhead is per unit, that's a bit confusing. Typically, fixed overhead is a fixed cost, not per unit. So maybe the $30 per unit is part of the total fixed overhead allocated per unit when they make 400,000 units. So the total fixed overhead would be 400,000 units * $30 = $12,000,000 per year.

If Match is making 400,000 units, their fixed overhead is $12,000,000. If they make 5,000 more, the fixed overhead would still be the same, so the additional 5,000 units don't add to fixed costs. Therefore, the variable costs are the only incremental costs for the special order.

Wait, but wait. The problem states that the costs per unit are based on a maximum capacity of 400,000. So perhaps the $30 per unit is the fixed overhead allocation, meaning that if they produce fewer units, the fixed overhead per unit increases, but since they're at 400,000, that's the maximum, so the fixed overhead per unit is $30. So for the special order, the fixed overhead per unit is already accounted for in the regular units. So when making the 5,000 units, the fixed overhead per unit isn't an incremental cost because it's already covered by the regular production.

Therefore, for the special order, the incremental cost per unit is the sum of direct materials, direct labor, and variable overhead: $60 + $10 + $40 = $110 per unit. Plus, if there are any variable selling costs, but since shipping is $10 per unit, and there's no shipping for this order, that's a saving. So the variable selling cost is $10 per unit, which they save because Reno's order doesn't require shipping.

Wait, but in the regular market, the selling price is $200, which includes the $10 shipping. So for the special order, the shipping is $0, so Match can potentially lower the price because they don't have to cover the shipping cost. Alternatively, maybe the selling price of $200 includes the shipping, so for the special order, they can reduce the price by $10 because shipping isn't needed. So the cost per unit for the special order would be the variable cost plus any allocated fixed costs that are relevant.

Wait, maybe I should approach this by calculating the total cost and revenue.

Regular sales: 400,000 units at $200 each. So total revenue is 400,000 * 200 = $80,000,000. Their total cost per unit is $140, so total cost is 400,000 * 140 = $56,000,000. Their total selling costs are (400,000 * $10) + $50,000 = $4,000,000 + $50,000 = $4,050,000. So their total expenses are $56,000,000 (production) + $4,050,000 (selling) = $60,050,000. Their profit would be $80,000,000 - $60,050,000 = $19,950,000.

But for the special order, Reno wants 5,000 units. If Match accepts this order, they might have to reduce their regular production by 5,000 units because they can't make more than 400,000. So, their regular sales would drop from 400,000 to 395,000. The loss in revenue would be 5,000 units * $200 = $1,000,000. Alternatively, if they can produce more than 400,000, but the problem says the maximum is 400,000, so that's not possible. Therefore, they have to reduce regular sales by 5,000 units.

So, the opportunity cost is the revenue lost from not selling those 5,000 units at the regular price. So, the loss is 5,000 * $200 = $1,000,000.

Alternatively, maybe they can make the 5,000 units without affecting regular production, but that would require exceeding 400,000, which isn't possible. So, the opportunity cost is the lost revenue.

Wait, but perhaps the fixed overhead is already covered, so the only thing that matters is the variable costs for the special order. So the cost to produce the special order is the variable cost per unit, which is $60 + $10 + $40 = $110. Plus, since shipping is not required, they save $10 per unit on selling costs. So the total cost per unit for the special order is $110, and the saving is $10, so the total cost is $110, but the revenue from regular sales is $200 per unit, so to make it worthwhile, the price per unit for the special order should at least cover the variable cost and any opportunity cost.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let's try another approach.

The key here is to determine the incremental cost of producing the 5,000 units for Reno. Since Match is already selling all 400,000 units, any additional units would require either increasing production beyond capacity (which isn't possible) or taking away from regular sales.

But since the capacity is 400,000, they can't make more. So, to fulfill Reno's order, they have to take 5,000 units from their regular sales. Therefore, the opportunity cost is the revenue lost from those 5,000 units at $200 each, which is $1,000,000.

So, the price that Match should set for Reno should at least cover the variable costs of producing those 5,000 units plus the opportunity cost per unit.

Wait, but opportunity cost is a cost, so it should be considered. So the price per unit should be at least the variable cost per unit plus any lost revenue per unit.

Wait, no. The opportunity cost is the revenue lost, which is $200 per unit. So, Match would want to set the price such that the revenue from Reno's order covers the variable costs and the lost revenue from regular sales.

Wait, but that might not be correct because the fixed costs are already covered by regular sales. Let me think again.

The fixed costs are $50,000 per year plus the fixed overhead allocated per unit. Wait, no, the fixed overhead per unit is $30, so total fixed overhead is 400,000 units * $30 = $12,000,000. So the total fixed costs are $12,000,000 + $50,000 = $12,050,000.

If Match sells 5,000 units to Reno, they have to reduce regular sales by 5,000 units. So, their regular revenue would drop by 5,000 * $200 = $1,000,000, and their variable costs would decrease by 5,000 * (direct materials + direct labor + variable overhead) = 5,000 * $110 = $550,000. Their fixed costs remain the same because they're fixed.

So, the net effect on profits would be a loss of $1,000,000 (revenue) minus a saving of $550,000 (variable costs), which is a net loss of $450,000. To avoid this loss, Match should set the price for Reno's order such that the revenue from Reno covers the variable costs and the lost revenue.

Wait, but that might not be the right way. Alternatively, the incremental profit from the special order should at least cover the opportunity cost.

Wait, perhaps it's better to calculate the minimum price per unit that would make the special order profitable.

The incremental revenue from the special order should at least cover the incremental costs and the opportunity cost.

Wait, but opportunity cost is a cost that should be considered. So, the price per unit should be such that:

Price per unit * 5,000 >= (Variable costs per unit * 5,000) + (Lost revenue per unit * 5,000)

But wait, that might not be correct because the lost revenue is a cost, so the price should cover both the variable costs and the lost revenue.

Alternatively, perhaps the price should be set at the variable cost plus the lost contribution margin.

Wait, contribution margin per unit is selling price minus variable costs. For regular sales, contribution margin is $200 - ($60 + $10 + $40) = $200 - $110 = $90. So, the contribution margin per unit is $90.

If they lose 5,000 units of regular sales, they lose 5,000 * $90 = $450,000 in contribution margin. So, to offset this loss, the special order should bring in at least $450,000 in contribution.

The special order's contribution margin would be (Price - Variable costs). So:

(Price - $110) * 5,000 >= $450,000

Divide both sides by 5,000:

Price - $110 >= $90

So, Price >= $200

Wait, that's the regular selling price. But that can't be right because Reno is asking for a special order, and Match might be able to sell it for less, but they shouldn't sell it for less than the variable cost.

Wait, but if the price is $200, they'd have zero loss because the contribution margin would be $90, same as before. But since they have to reduce regular sales by 5,000 units, their total contribution would remain the same. So, perhaps they can sell the special order at a lower price, but not below the variable cost.

Wait, but the calculation above suggests that to cover the lost contribution margin, the price should be at least $200. That seems contradictory because the regular price is $200, and the special order is usually priced lower. Maybe I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the fixed costs are already covered by the regular sales, so the special order only needs to cover the variable costs and any additional costs. But in this case, since they have to reduce regular sales, the opportunity cost is the lost contribution margin.

So, the minimum price per unit for the special order should be such that:

Price >= Variable cost per unit + (Opportunity cost per unit)

But the opportunity cost per unit is the lost contribution margin, which is $90. So:

Price >= $110 + $90 = $200

But that again suggests the price should be at least $200, which is the regular price. That can't be right because Reno is a special customer, so they might be willing to pay less, but Match shouldn't accept a price that reduces their profit.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let's try another approach.

What's the incremental cost of producing the 5,000 units? Since Match is already at full capacity, producing the 5,000 units would require not producing 5,000 regular units. So, the incremental cost is the variable cost of producing the 5,000 units, which is $110 per unit. But since they're not producing those 5,000 regular units, they save on the variable costs of those units, but they lose the revenue from those units.

So, the incremental profit from the special order is:

(Price per unit * 5,000) - (Variable cost per unit * 5,000) - (Regular revenue lost * 5,000)

Wait, no, because the regular revenue lost is already part of the opportunity cost. So, the net incremental profit is:

(Price * 5,000) - (Variable costs * 5,000) - (Regular revenue * 5,000)

But that would be:

5,000*(Price - Variable costs - Regular price)

Which would be 5,000*(Price - $110 - $200) = 5,000*(Price - $310)

Wait, that can't be right because it would imply a loss unless Price is over $310, which is impossible.

I think I'm making a mistake here. Let's try to think differently.

The correct approach is to calculate the incremental cost of the special order and ensure that the revenue from the order covers these costs. Since the company is already at full capacity, the only way to produce the special order is to reduce regular production. Therefore, the incremental cost is the variable cost per unit for the special order, which is $110. Additionally, the company loses the contribution margin from the regular sales they would have made on those 5,000 units.

The contribution margin per unit is $200 - $110 = $90. So, for each unit in the special order, the company is giving up $90 in contribution margin. Therefore, to make the special order profitable, the price per unit should be set at a level where the revenue from the order covers both the variable costs and the lost contribution margin.

So, the price per unit should be at least the variable cost plus the lost contribution margin per unit:

Price >= $110 + $90 = $200

But that's the same as the regular price, which suggests that selling at $200 would break even, neither gaining nor losing profit. But since the company can't increase production, they might as well sell the units at $200, but that's not a discount. However, the problem states that Reno's order has no shipping costs, so perhaps the price can be lower because shipping is saved.

Wait, in the regular market, the selling price is $200, which includes shipping. For the special order, shipping is $0, so perhaps the price can be reduced by $10, making the price $190 per unit. But then, does that affect the calculation?

Let me think again. The regular selling price includes shipping, which is $10 per unit. So, if Match sells to Reno without shipping, they can reduce the price by $10 because they don't have to cover the shipping cost. So, the variable cost per unit is $110, and the price can be set at $110 + $90 (lost contribution) = $200, but since shipping is saved, maybe the price can be $190, which is $200 - $10.

But wait, the fixed costs are already covered by regular sales. The variable costs are $110, and the opportunity cost is $90 per unit. So, the minimum price is $200. But if shipping is saved, perhaps the price can be $190 because they save $10 on shipping.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the total cost of the special order, which includes the variable costs and any fixed costs that are applicable. But since the fixed costs are already covered, the only incremental cost is the variable cost plus the lost revenue.

Wait, perhaps the correct way is to calculate the cost per unit for the special order, which is $110, and since shipping is saved, the price can be $110 plus any desired profit. But since Match doesn't want to lose money, the price should at least cover the variable cost plus the lost contribution.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me try to outline the steps clearly:

1. Determine if the special order can be accommodated without affecting regular production. Since Match is at full capacity, no, so they have to reduce regular sales by 5,000 units.

2. Calculate the opportunity cost: 5,000 units * $200 = $1,000,000 in lost revenue.

3. Calculate the variable cost saved by not producing 5,000 regular units: 5,000 * $110 = $550,000.

4. Net opportunity cost: $1,000,000 - $550,000 = $450,000.

5. To cover this net opportunity cost, the revenue from the special order must be at least $450,000.

6. Therefore, the price per unit should be $450,000 / 5,000 = $90.

Wait, that can't be right because $90 is way below the variable cost of $110. That would result in a loss.

I think I'm mixing up concepts here. Let me try another approach.

The correct formula for the minimum price in a special order when capacity is constrained is:

Minimum price = Variable cost per unit + (Lost contribution margin per unit)

Lost contribution margin per unit is the contribution margin from the regular sales that would be lost.

Contribution margin per unit = Selling price - Variable cost = $200 - $110 = $90.

So, the minimum price should be Variable cost + Lost contribution margin = $110 + $90 = $200.

But since the special order doesn't require shipping, the variable selling cost is $10 less. So, the variable cost for the special order is $110 (as before) minus the $10 shipping saved? Wait, no. The variable cost of $110 includes the shipping cost? No, the shipping cost is a separate selling cost, not part of the production cost.

Wait, the $140 per unit includes direct materials, direct labor, variable overhead, and fixed overhead. The shipping is a separate cost of $10 per unit in the regular market. So, for the special order, since there's no shipping, Match saves $10 per unit on selling costs.

Therefore, the variable cost for the special order is still $110 (production costs) but without the $10 shipping. So, the total cost per unit is $110, and the saving is $10, so the effective cost is $110.

But to cover the opportunity cost, the price should be set such that:

Price per unit >= Variable cost + Lost contribution margin.

Wait, no, the lost contribution margin is the contribution from regular sales, which is $90 per unit. So, the price should be at least $110 + $90 = $200. But again, that's the regular price, which doesn't make sense for a special order.

Alternatively, perhaps the saving on shipping allows Match to reduce the price. Since shipping is $10 per unit saved, the price can be $200 - $10 = $190. But does that make sense?

Wait, let me think again. The regular price is $200, which includes $10 for shipping. For the special order, since there's no shipping, Match can reduce the price by $10, making it $190. But they also have to cover the variable production costs of $110 and the lost contribution margin of $90. So:

Price = $110 (variable production) + $90 (lost contribution) = $200.

But if they can reduce the price by $10 due to no shipping, they would set the price at $190, which is $200 - $10. But would that cover their costs and opportunity cost?

Wait, if they set the price at $190, the contribution from the special order would be $190 - $110 = $80 per unit. The lost contribution from regular sales is $90 per unit. So, the net effect is a loss of $10 per unit, which is $50,000 total loss. That's not acceptable.

Therefore, they cannot reduce the price below $200 because that would result in a loss. Alternatively, perhaps they can set the price at $200, which would cover the variable costs and the lost contribution, resulting in no change in profit.

But that seems counterintuitive because the special order is a chance to make an additional $200 per unit without any extra cost beyond variable. Wait, but since they have to reduce regular sales, they're effectively swapping one sale for another, but the price remains the same. So, perhaps the minimum price is $200.

But looking at the options, $200 is option F. But I'm not sure because I might have missed something.

Wait, another approach: the incremental cost for the special order is the variable production cost, which is $110 per unit. Since the fixed costs are already covered, and the special order doesn't require any additional fixed costs, the minimum price should be set at the variable cost plus any profit desired. But since they're forgoing regular sales, they should set the price to at least cover the lost revenue.

Wait, but the lost revenue is $200 per unit, so the price should be at least $200 to break even. But that can't be right because the variable cost is $110, so they could sell it for $110 and still make a loss, but that's not acceptable.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the total cost of the special order, including the lost contribution margin.

Total cost for the special order:

- Variable production cost: 5,000 * $110 = $550,000
- Lost contribution margin: 5,000 * $90 = $450,000
Total cost: $1,000,000

Total revenue needed: $1,000,000

Price per unit: $1,000,000 / 5,000 = $200

So, the minimum price is $200. That's option F.

But wait, the problem states that shipping is $10 per unit in the regular market. For the special order, there's no shipping cost, so Match saves $10 per unit on selling costs. Does that affect the calculation?

Yes, because the $10 per unit is a variable cost that's saved. So, the variable cost for the special order is $110 (production) minus the $10 saved from shipping, so $100. But wait, no. The $110 includes the production costs; the shipping is a separate cost. So, the variable cost for the special order is still $110, but the saving is $10 per unit on selling costs. So, the total cost is $110 - $10 = $100? No, that's not correct because the $110 is the production cost, and the $10 is a selling cost. So, the saving is $10 per unit, but the production cost remains $110.

Therefore, the relevant cost for the special order is $110 per unit, but since they save $10 on shipping, the effective cost is $110, and the price can be set at $110 plus the lost contribution margin of $90, totaling $200. But since they save $10 on shipping, perhaps the price can be reduced by $10, making it $190.

Wait, let me clarify. The regular price is $200, which includes $10 for shipping. For the special order, since there's no shipping, the price could be $190, which is $200 - $10. But does that cover all costs?

If they sell at $190, their contribution from the special order is $190 - $110 = $80. The lost contribution from regular sales is $90, so the net loss is $10 per unit, which is $50,000 total. That's not acceptable.

Therefore, they can't reduce the price below $200 because that would result in a loss. So, the minimum price is $200.

Looking at the options, F is $200. So, the answer should be F.
</think>

To determine the lowest price per unit at which Match Co. should be willing to sell 5,000 units to Reno Co., we need to consider the incremental costs and opportunity costs associated with the special order.

### Key Information:
- **Production Costs per Unit**:
  - Direct materials: $60
  - Direct labor: $10
  - Variable overhead: $40
  - Fixed overhead: $30 (allocated based on 400,000 units)
  - **Total cost per unit**: $140

- **Regular Sales**:
  - Selling price per unit: $200
  - Variable selling cost per unit: $10 (shipping)
  - Fixed licensing fee: $50,000 per year

- **Special Order**:
  - Quantity: 5,000 units
  - No shipping costs
  - Match Co. is already selling 400,000 units annually at full capacity.

### Analysis:
1. **Incremental Costs for the Special Order**:
   - Since Match Co. is at full capacity, producing the additional 5,000 units for Reno Co. would require reducing regular production by 5,000 units.
   - The **variable production cost per unit** for the special order is:
     \[
     \$60 \, (\text{materials}) + \$10 \, (\text{labor}) + \$40 \, (\text{overhead}) = \$110
     \]
   - The **shipping cost** is $10 per unit in regular sales, but it is waived for the special order. This saving reduces the effective cost.

2. **Opportunity Cost**:
   - By reducing regular production by 5,000 units, Match Co. loses:
     \[
     5,000 \times \$200 = \$1,000,000 \, (\text{revenue})
     \]
   - However, the variable production cost saved from not producing 5,000 regular units is:
     \[
     5,000 \times \$110 = \$550,000
     \]
   - The **net opportunity cost** is:
     \[
     \$1,000,000 - \$550,000 = \$450,000
     \]

3. **Contribution Margin**:
   - The **contribution margin per unit** for regular sales is:
     \[
     \$200 \, (\text{selling price}) - \$110 \, (\text{variable cost}) = \$90
     \]
   - For the special order, the price must cover the variable production cost and the lost contribution margin to avoid a net loss.

4. **Minimum Price Calculation**:
   - To break even, the price per unit for the special order should cover:
     \[
     \$110 \, (\text{variable cost}) + \$90 \, (\text{lost contribution margin}) = \$200
     \]
   - Since the special order has no shipping costs, the price can be reduced by $10 (the shipping cost saved). However, reducing the price below $200 would result in a net loss due to the opportunity cost.

### Conclusion:
The lowest price per unit at which Match Co. should be willing to sell the 5,000 units to Reno Co. is **$200**.
