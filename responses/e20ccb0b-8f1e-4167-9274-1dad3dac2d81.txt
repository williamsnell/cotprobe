<think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about heat transfer in a vertical cylinder. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll think it through.

First, the problem says the cylinder is vertical with an outside diameter of 1.0 ft and a length of 2.0 ft. Steam is condensing on the outer surface, and the outer surface is kept at 85°F using cooling water inside. The saturation temperature is 105°F. We need to find three things: the overall heat transfer coefficient (U), the total rate of heat transfer (Q), and the total rate of condensation (m_dot).

Hmm, I remember that for heat transfer involving condensation, the overall heat transfer coefficient is the sum of the convective and condusive components. Wait, no, actually, it's the sum in a particular way because they are in series. The formula is 1/U = 1/h + R_cond, where h is the convective heat transfer coefficient and R_cond is the resistance due to condensation.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me think again. The overall U is calculated based on the sum of the individual resistances. So, the total thermal resistance R_total is R_conduction + R_convective + R_condensation. But wait, in this case, the cylinder is made of a material, so conduction through the cylinder's wall would be part of it. But wait, the problem doesn't specify the material of the cylinder or its thickness. Oh, wait, maybe it's a thin cylinder, so the conduction through the wall is negligible? Or perhaps it's assumed that the heat transfer is purely between the steam and the cooling water through convection and condensation, without significant conduction through the cylinder material.

Wait, the problem states that steam is condensing on the outer surface, and the cooling water is inside. So perhaps the heat transfer is from steam (outside) to the outer surface, then through conduction if the cylinder is a solid, then from the inner surface to the cooling water. But since the problem doesn't give the cylinder's material or thickness, maybe it's assumed that the conduction through the cylinder is negligible, so we can ignore it. That would mean that the overall heat transfer coefficient U would just be the sum of the convective and condensing resistances.

Wait, no, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's see. The overall U is given by the formula:

1/U = (1/h1) + R_cond + (1/h2)

Where h1 is the convective coefficient for the steam side, R_cond is the condensation resistance, and h2 is the convective coefficient for the water side. But wait, in this problem, the outer surface is at 85°F, and the steam is at its saturation temperature of 105°F. So the steam is at 105°F, and the outer surface is at 85°F, which is lower, causing condensation.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the outer surface is maintained at 85°F by cooling water inside. So the steam is at a higher temperature (105°F), and the outer surface is at 85°F. Wait, no, that's not possible because the saturation temperature for steam is 105°F, so the steam would be at that temperature, and the outer surface is at 85°F, which is lower, so condensation occurs on the outer surface of the cylinder.

Wait, but the outer surface is at 85°F, which is lower than the steam's saturation temperature, so the steam will condense on the outer surface. Hmm, but wait, wait, that doesn't make sense because the saturation temperature is the temperature at which condensation occurs. If the surface is at 85°F, which is lower than 105°F, then the steam would have to be at a higher temperature for condensation to occur. But the problem says the saturation temperature is 105°F, so the steam is probably at that temperature, and the outer surface is at a lower temperature, which would cause condensation.

Wait, but this might mean that the steam is in the vapor state at 105°F, and the outer surface is at 85°F, so the steam will condense on the surface. So the heat transfer is from the steam to the cylinder wall, then through any conduction (if any), then from the cylinder wall to the cooling water inside. But since the problem doesn't give the cylinder's material or thickness, perhaps we can assume that the conduction resistance is negligible, making U just the sum of the convective and condensation resistances.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to outline the steps.

First, to find the overall heat transfer coefficient U, I think the formula is:

1/U = (1/h1) + R_cond + (1/h2)

But if the cylinder is thin, then the conduction resistance (R_cond) is negligible, so 1/U = 1/h1 + 1/h2.

Wait, but in this problem, the cooling water is inside, so the inner surface is in contact with the water, which is at 85°F. So the heat is transferred from the steam (105°F) to the outer surface (85°F) via convection, and then from the inner surface (which is also at 85°F) to the cooling water via convection. But wait, that would imply that the two convective resistances are in series, so the overall U would be the harmonic mean of h1 and h2. But I'm not sure if that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for U when there's condensation is different. Wait, I think when you have a condensing fluid on one side and a convective fluid on the other, the overall U is given by:

U = (h1 * h2) / (h1 + h2)

Wait, no, that's for when you have two convective resistances in series. But in this case, one side is condensation. So maybe the formula is:

1/U = (1/h1) + R_cond

Because the condensation resistance is a separate term.

Wait, let me think again. The condensation resistance (R_cond) is given by the latent heat of vaporization divided by the heat flux. Alternatively, the formula for R_cond is 1/(h_cond * ( latent heat / (density * specific heat) )) or something like that. Wait, no, perhaps it's better to refer to the general formula.

The condensation resistance R_cond is equal to (1/(h_cond * ( latent heat / (density * specific heat) ))), but I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should look up the formula for the condensation coefficient.

Wait, I think the formula for the overall heat transfer coefficient when there's condensation on one side and convection on the other is:

1/U = (1/h1) + (x/L) + (1/h2)

Wait, no, perhaps that's for a different scenario. Alternatively, maybe the condensation resistance is given by R_cond = (1/h_cond), where h_cond is the condensation coefficient. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this by finding the condensation coefficient first. The condensation coefficient h_cond is given by the formula:

h_cond = (2 * L * (T_sat - T_sur)) / (x * (vapor pressure at T_sat - vapor pressure at T_sur)))

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use the formula for the condensation heat transfer coefficient when the surface is maintained at a temperature lower than the saturation temperature. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, perhaps I should refer to the formula for the overall heat transfer coefficient in the case of condensation on one side and convection on the other. Let me think: The overall U is given by the reciprocal of the sum of the individual resistances. So, for the steam side, we have convection, then condensation, and then on the cooling water side, we have convection again.

Wait, but in this problem, the outer surface is at 85°F, which is lower than the steam's saturation temperature of 105°F, so the steam will condense on the outer surface. So the process is: steam (105°F) → convection (h1) → cylinder wall (85°F) → condensation (R_cond) → cylinder wall (85°F) → convection (h2) → cooling water (85°F). Wait, but the cooling water is at 85°F, same as the cylinder's inner surface, so perhaps h2 is the convective coefficient for the water side, but since the temperature is the same on both sides, maybe h2 isn't needed? Or perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, perhaps the overall heat transfer coefficient U is just the sum of the convective coefficient for the steam and the condensation coefficient. Or maybe it's the sum of the two resistances in series.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the overall U using the formula:

1/U = (1/h1) + (1/h_cond)

Because the heat transfer involves convection from steam to the surface and condensation on the surface. But wait, no, because the condensation is a separate process, and the resistance due to condensation is R_cond = h_cond^(-1) * something. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm making this more complicated than it needs to be. Maybe the overall U is simply the sum of the convective and condensation coefficients in parallel or series. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the formula where U is the harmonic mean of h1 and h2, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I should look at the options and see if any of them make sense based on typical values. The options for U are in the range of 800 to 1150 Btu/hr-ft²-°F. I think that for condensation, the overall U could be in that range.

But perhaps I should proceed step by step. Let's list the given data:

- Outer diameter, D = 1.0 ft → radius r = 0.5 ft
- Length, L = 2.0 ft
- T_surface = 85°F
- T_sat = 105°F (steam's saturation temperature)
- Cooling water inside at T = 85°F

We need to find:

a) Overall heat transfer coefficient, U
b) Total heat transfer rate, Q
c) Total condensation rate, m_dot

I think the approach is to calculate the heat transfer rate Q using the formula Q = U * A * ΔT, where A is the surface area, and ΔT is the temperature difference.

The surface area A for a cylinder is 2πrL, but since the cylinder is vertical and the heat transfer is on the outer surface, A = 2πrL.

But wait, in this problem, the heat transfer is between the steam and the cooling water through the cylinder. So the surface area would be the outer surface area. So A = 2π*(0.5 ft)*2 ft = π ft² ≈ 3.1416 ft².

Wait, let me calculate that: 2 * π * 0.5 * 2 = 2π ft² ≈ 6.283 ft². Oh, right, because 2πrL, r=0.5 ft, L=2 ft. So 2 * π * 0.5 * 2 = 2π ≈ 6.283 ft².

Now, the temperature difference between the steam and the outer surface is 105 - 85 = 20°F.

So Q = U * A * ΔT.

But I don't know U yet. So how do I find U?

Hmm, perhaps I should consider the condensation process. The heat transfer due to condensation is the latent heat of vaporization multiplied by the mass condensation rate. The formula for heat transfer due to condensation is Q = m_dot * h_fg, where h_fg is the latent heat of vaporization.

So once I find Q, I can find m_dot as Q / h_fg.

But wait, I also need to find U. So maybe I can find U using the formula involving the steam convective coefficient and the condensation coefficient.

Wait, I think I'm getting stuck here. Let me think again. The overall U is given by the sum of the individual resistances. The formula is:

1/U = (1/h1) + R_cond + (1/h2)

But if the inner surface is in contact with the cooling water at the same temperature as the outer surface, then the convection on the inner side (h2) would be negligible because the temperature difference is zero. So perhaps in this case, the overall U is just the sum of the convective and condensation resistances on the steam side.

Wait, that makes sense. Because the cooling water is at 85°F, which is the same as the outer surface, so there's no temperature difference for convection on the inner side. So the heat transfer is dominated by the steam's convection and the condensation.

So, 1/U = (1/h1) + R_cond

But what's R_cond? R_cond is the resistance to heat transfer due to condensation, which is given by R_cond = 1/(h_cond * (h_fg / (rho * c_p)))? Wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps R_cond is equal to 1/(h_cond), where h_cond is the condensation coefficient.

Wait, perhaps it's better to use the formula for the overall U when there's condensation. The formula for the overall heat transfer coefficient when one side is condensing is:

U = (h1 * h_cond) / (h1 + h_cond)

Wait, is that correct? Or is it the harmonic mean of h1 and h_cond?

Wait, no, I think the overall U would be given by the reciprocal of the sum of the individual resistances. So if the resistance due to convection is 1/h1 and the resistance due to condensation is 1/h_cond, then:

1/U = (1/h1) + (1/h_cond)

So U = 1 / (1/h1 + 1/h_cond) = (h1 * h_cond) / (h1 + h_cond)

But I don't know h1 or h_cond. So perhaps I'm missing some data here.

Wait, maybe I can find h1 using the Nusselt number for external flow over a cylinder. But without knowing the flow conditions, it's hard to estimate h1. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to assume a value for h1 or h_cond.

Wait, perhaps the problem is assuming that the cylinder is a thin-walled cylinder, so the conduction resistance is negligible, and the overall U is just the sum of the convective and condensation resistances. But without knowing h1 or h_cond, I'm stuck.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the options. The problem gives options for U, Q, and m_dot. Perhaps I can calculate each part based on the given data and see which option matches.

Let's proceed step by step.

First, calculate the surface area A.

A = 2 * π * r * L = 2 * π * 0.5 ft * 2 ft = 2π * 1 ft² ≈ 6.283 ft².

The temperature difference ΔT is 105 - 85 = 20°F.

The latent heat of vaporization h_fg at 105°F needs to be found. From steam tables, at 105°F, h_fg is approximately 984 Btu/lb (I think it's around there, but I'm not 100% sure).

So, h_fg ≈ 984 Btu/lb.

Now, the total heat transfer rate Q can be calculated using Q = U * A * ΔT.

But without U, I can't proceed. Alternatively, Q can also be expressed as Q = m_dot * h_fg.

So, if I can find Q in two ways, I can relate U and m_dot.

But I still need another equation to find U and m_dot.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the overall heat transfer coefficient U is given by the formula involving the convective and condensation coefficients. Suppose h1 is the convective coefficient for steam, and h_cond is the condensation coefficient. Then, 1/U = 1/h1 + 1/h_cond.

But without knowing h1 or h_cond, I can't find U directly. So perhaps the problem expects me to assume that the overall U is the harmonic mean of h1 and h_cond, but without their values, I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps the problem is simpler. Maybe it's assuming that the heat transfer is purely due to convection and condensation, and that the overall U is given by the formula:

U = (h1 * h_cond) / (h1 + h_cond)

But again, without knowing h1 or h_cond, I can't compute U.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the formula for the overall heat transfer coefficient when one side is condensing, which is U = h1 + h_cond. But that doesn't seem right because units wouldn't match.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's look at the options and see if any of them make sense.

Looking at option E: U = 978.97 Btu/hr-ft²-°F, Q = 123,021 Btu/hr, m_dot = 94.3 lb/hr.

Let's compute Q using option E's U:

Q = U * A * ΔT = 978.97 * 6.283 * 20 ≈ 978.97 * 125.66 ≈ Let me compute that.

978.97 * 125.66 ≈ Let's approximate:

978.97 * 100 = 97,897

978.97 * 25 = approx 24,474.25

978.97 * 5.66 ≈ approx 5,543. So total ≈ 97,897 +24,474=122,371 +5,543=127,914. Hmm, but option E's Q is 123,021, which is a bit lower. Maybe my approximation is off.

Alternatively, let's compute more accurately:

6.283 ft² * 20°F = 125.66 °F-ft².

So U * A * ΔT = 978.97 * 125.66 ≈ Let's compute 978.97 * 125.66.

Let me compute 978.97 * 125 = 978.97 * 100 = 97,897; 978.97 *25=24,474.25 → total 122,371.25.

Then 978.97 * 0.66 = approx 647. So total ≈ 122,371 + 647 = 123,018 Btu/hr, which matches option E's Q of 123,021. Close enough.

So if Q is approximately 123,021 Btu/hr, then m_dot = Q / h_fg = 123,021 / 984 ≈ let's compute that.

123021 ÷ 984 ≈ let's see: 984 * 125 = 123,000. So 123,021 /984 ≈ 125 lb/hr. But option E says m_dot is 94.3 lb/hr. Hmm, that's a discrepancy. Wait, perhaps my h_fg is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the latent heat at 105°F is different. Let me check: at 100°C (which is 212°F), h_fg is about 970 Btu/lb. At 105°F, which is just slightly above 100°C? Wait, no, 105°F is about 40.6°C, which is below the boiling point of water. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, the saturation temperature at standard pressure is 212°F. So 105°F would correspond to a lower pressure, where the saturation temperature is 105°F. So the latent heat at that point would be lower than at 212°F.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me get the correct value of h_fg at 105°F. Looking up steam tables, at 105°F (which is 40.6°C), the pressure is about 14.38 psia, and the latent heat h_fg is approximately 958 Btu/lb. So using that, m_dot = Q / h_fg = 123,021 / 958 ≈ let's compute.

123,021 ÷ 958 ≈ 128.4 lb/hr. But option E says m_dot is 94.3 lb/hr, which is lower. So perhaps this approach isn't correct.

Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating something. Let me check the options again.

Option E: U = 978.97, Q = 123,021, m_dot =94.3.

If Q is 123,021 Btu/hr, and h_fg is 958 Btu/lb, then m_dot = 123,021 / 958 ≈ 128.4 lb/hr. But option E says 94.3, which is about 73% of that. So perhaps my assumption about the formula is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the overall U isn't just based on the steam side. Maybe I should consider that the heat transfer is from steam to the cylinder wall via convection and condensation, and then from cylinder wall to cooling water via convection. But since the cooling water is at the same temperature as the cylinder's inner surface, the convection on the water side doesn't contribute to the resistance. So perhaps the overall U is determined by the steam's convection and condensation.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the formula for the overall heat transfer coefficient when one side involves condensation. The formula I think is:

1/U = (1/h1) + R_cond

Where R_cond is the condensation resistance, which is equal to (1/(h_cond * (h_fg / (rho * c_p))))). Wait, perhaps R_cond is given by the formula:

R_cond = 1/(h_cond * (h_fg / (rho * c_p))) )

But I'm not entirely sure about this. Alternatively, perhaps R_cond is simply 1/h_cond, where h_cond is the condensation coefficient.

Wait, perhaps I can find h_cond using the formula for forced convection condensation, but without flow details, it's hard. Alternatively, maybe the problem assumes that h_cond is equal to h1, but that's a guess.

Alternatively, perhaps the overall U is given by:

U = h1 + h_cond

But that doesn't seem dimensionally correct.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the formula for the overall heat transfer coefficient when one side is condensing. I think the formula is:

1/U = (1/h1) + (x/L) + (1/h2)

But without knowing x (thickness) or material properties, I can't use that.

Wait, perhaps the problem is designed to use the formula where U is the sum of the convective and condensation coefficients. So U = h1 + h_cond. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects me to assume that the overall U is the condensation coefficient itself. But that seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to approach it differently. Let's assume that the overall U is the one provided in the options, and see which one fits.

Looking at option E: U=978.97, Q=123,021, m_dot=94.3.

Using U=978.97, A=6.283, ΔT=20, Q=978.97 * 6.283 * 20 ≈ 978.97 * 125.66 ≈ as before, 123,021 Btu/hr.

Then, m_dot = Q / h_fg. If h_fg is 984 Btu/lb, then m_dot ≈ 123021 / 984 ≈ 125 lb/hr. But option E says m_dot is 94.3, which is lower. So perhaps my h_fg is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I should use the latent heat at 105°F. Let me double-check. At 105°F, the latent heat of vaporization is approximately 958 Btu/lb. So m_dot = 123,021 / 958 ≈ 128.4 lb/hr. But option E says 94.3, which is about 73% of that. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm miscalculating the surface area. Let me recalculate A.

A = 2πrL = 2 * π * 0.5 ft * 2 ft = 2π ft² ≈ 6.283 ft². That seems correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the temperature difference. The steam's temperature is at the saturation temperature of 105°F, and the outer surface is at 85°F. So ΔT = 105 -85 =20°F. That's correct.

Hmm, perhaps the problem expects me to use a different approach. Let's think about the condensation rate formula.

The rate of condensation m_dot is given by:

m_dot = (h * A * (T_sat - T_surface)) / h_fg

But wait, that's if h is the overall heat transfer coefficient. So m_dot = (U * A * ΔT) / h_fg.

Using option E's values: U=978.97, A=6.283, ΔT=20, h_fg=958.

m_dot = (978.97 * 6.283 * 20) / 958 ≈ (123,021) /958 ≈ 128.4 lb/hr. But option E says 94.3, so that's not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula with h1 and h_cond in series.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the overall U is the sum of the convective and condensation resistances. So 1/U = (1/h1) + (1/h_cond). But without knowing h1 or h_cond, I can't proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the overall U is the harmonic mean of h1 and h_cond, but without their values, I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps the problem is designed to use the formula for the overall heat transfer coefficient when there's condensation, which is:

U = (h1 * h2) / (h1 + h2)

But in this case, h1 is the convective coefficient for steam, and h2 is the condensation coefficient. But without knowing h1 and h2, I can't compute U.

Wait, maybe I should look for the answer that has Q = U * A * ΔT matching with m_dot = Q / h_fg.

Looking at option E again: Q=123,021, h_fg=958, so m_dot=123,021/958≈128.4 lb/hr, but option E says 94.3. Not matching.

Option D: U=1000, Q=119,000, m_dot=92.

Compute m_dot: 119,000 /958 ≈ 124 lb/hr. Not matching 92.

Option B: U=800, Q=100,000, m_dot=80.

m_dot=100,000 /958≈104 lb/hr. Not matching.

Option A: U=1025, Q=128,000, m_dot=98.

m_dot=128,000 /958≈133.6 lb/hr. Not matching.

Option C: U=1100, Q=130,000, m_dot=100.

m_dot=130,000 /958≈135.7 lb/hr. Not matching.

Option F: U=900, Q=120,000, m_dot=90.

m_dot=120,000 /958≈125.2 lb/hr. Not matching.

Option G: U=1050, Q=125,000, m_dot=95.

m_dot=125,000 /958≈130.4 lb/hr. Not matching.

Option H: U=850, Q=110,000, m_dot=85.

m_dot=110,000 /958≈114.8 lb/hr. Not matching.

Option I: U=1150, Q=135,000, m_dot=103.

m_dot=135,000 /958≈140.9 lb/hr. Not matching.

Option J: U=950, Q=117,500, m_dot=89.

m_dot=117500 /958≈122.6 lb/hr. Not matching.

Hmm, none of the options have m_dot matching the calculated value based on their Q and h_fg=958 Btu/lb. So perhaps my assumption about h_fg is incorrect. Maybe the latent heat at 105°F is higher than I thought.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the latent heat at 105°F. Let me think: at 100°F, the latent heat is around 956 Btu/lb, and it decreases as temperature increases because the pressure is lower. Wait no, actually, at higher temperatures (closer to boiling point), the latent heat decreases. Wait, no, the latent heat of vaporization decreases as temperature increases because the molecules require less energy to escape as vapor.

Wait, perhaps I should look up the latent heat at 105°F. From steam tables, at 105°F (which is 40.6°C), the latent heat h_fg is approximately 958 Btu/lb. So I think my value is correct.

So perhaps the problem is using a different value for h_fg. Let me check option E's m_dot: 94.3 lb/hr.

If m_dot =94.3, then Q=94.3 * h_fg. Let's compute Q using h_fg=958:

Q=94.3 *958≈90,455 Btu/hr. But option E's Q is 123,021, which is higher. So that doesn't match.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing a factor related to the cylinder's dimensions or the heat transfer process.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the inner diameter instead of outer? No, the problem states the outside diameter is 1.0 ft.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the heat transfer is only on the outer surface, and the inner surface is at the same temperature, so the overall U is just the sum of the convective and condensation coefficients. But without knowing their individual values, I can't compute U.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula for U as the sum of the convective and condensation coefficients in series, so 1/U=1/h1 + 1/h_cond.

But without knowing h1 or h_cond, I can't proceed. Maybe the problem expects me to use the formula for U when the surface is at the saturation temperature, which would be U=h1 + h_cond, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed so that the overall U is the harmonic mean of the convective and condensation coefficients. So U=2/(1/h1 +1/h_cond). But without their values, I can't compute.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me consider that the overall U is given by the formula:

U = (h1 * h2) / (h1 + h2)

But in this case, h2 would be the condensation coefficient. So if I assume h1 and h2 are equal, then U would be h1. But that's a guess.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the formula where U is the sum of the convective and condensation coefficients. So U = h1 + h_cond.

But without knowing either, I can't proceed.

Wait, perhaps I should look for an option where Q is U*A*ΔT and m_dot=Q/h_fg, and see which option has m_dot matching.

Looking at option E: Q=123,021 Btu/hr, U=978.97, A=6.283, ΔT=20. So 978.97 *6.283*20 ≈123,021. Correct.

Then m_dot=123,021 / h_fg. If m_dot is 94.3, then h_fg=123,021 /94.3 ≈1,304 Btu/lb. But that's higher than the actual h_fg at 105°F, which is around 958 Btu/lb. So perhaps option E is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula for m_dot. Wait, the formula for m_dot is:

m_dot = (U * A * ΔT) / h_fg

So if m_dot is 94.3, then:

94.3 = (U * 6.283 * 20) / h_fg

So U = (94.3 * h_fg) / (6.283 * 20)

If h_fg is 958, then:

U = (94.3 *958) / 125.66 ≈ (90,455.4) / 125.66 ≈720 Btu/hr-ft²-°F.

But none of the options have U around 720. So perhaps this approach isn't correct.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a factor. Let me think again. The formula for m_dot is:

m_dot = (h * A * ΔT) / h_fg

But h here is the overall heat transfer coefficient. So if the overall U is the one given in the options, then m_dot must be (U * A * ΔT)/h_fg.

So for option E:

m_dot = (978.97 *6.283 *20)/958 ≈ (123,021)/958 ≈128.4 lb/hr.

But option E says 94.3 lb/hr, which doesn't match.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is using a different approach. Maybe the overall U includes the conduction through the cylinder wall. But without knowing the wall thickness or thermal conductivity, I can't compute that.

Wait, perhaps the problem is designed to use the formula for natural convection condensation. The formula for the convective coefficient for natural convection of steam is:

h1 = (0.62 * (T_sat - T_sur)^(1/3)) [Btu/hr-ft²-°F]

But I'm not sure about this formula. Alternatively, perhaps it's:

h1 = C * (T_sat - T_sur)^(n)

Where C and n are constants depending on the fluid and flow conditions.

But without knowing the flow regime (natural or forced convection), it's hard to estimate h1.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use a standard value for h1, such as 100 Btu/hr-ft²-°F, but that's a guess.

Wait, perhaps the problem is designed to use the formula where the overall U is given by the sum of the convective and condensation resistances, and with h1 and h_cond being the same, U would be h1 + h_cond = 2h1. But without knowing h1, I can't compute.

I think I'm stuck here. Given the time I've spent and the information I have, I'll have to make an educated guess. Among the options, option E seems to have the closest values for Q and U when using the surface area and temperature difference, but the m_dot doesn't match if h_fg is 958 Btu/lb. However, perhaps the problem used a different h_fg value.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula where the overall U is the sum of the convective and condensation coefficients, leading to a lower m_dot. But without more information, I can't be certain.

Given the options, I think option E is the most plausible, as its Q and U values align with the calculated surface area and temperature difference.

The problem involves determining the overall heat transfer coefficient (U), total heat transfer rate (Q), and total condensation rate (m_dot) for a vertical cylinder with steam condensing on its outer surface. The cylinder has an outside diameter of 1.0 ft, a length of 2.0 ft, and the outer surface is maintained at 85°F with cooling water inside. The steam's saturation temperature is 105°F.

### Key Steps and Analysis:
1. **Surface Area Calculation**:  
   The outer surface area \( A \) is calculated using the formula for a cylinder:  
   \[
   A = 2\pi r L = 2\pi (0.5 \, \text{ft}) (2.0 \, \text{ft}) = 2\pi \, \text{ft}^2 \approx 6.283 \, \text{ft}^2
   \]

2. **Temperature Difference**:  
   The temperature difference between the steam and the outer surface is:  
   \[
   \Delta T = 105°F - 85°F = 20°F
   \]

3. **Heat Transfer Rate (Q)**:  
   Using the formula \( Q = U \cdot A \cdot \Delta T \), the total heat transfer rate depends on the overall heat transfer coefficient (U). Testing the options, option E provides \( U = 978.97 \, \text{Btu/hr-ft}^2-°F \), which gives:  
   \[
   Q = 978.97 \cdot 6.283 \cdot 20 \approx 123,021 \, \text{Btu/hr}
   \]

4. **Condensation Rate (m_dot)**:  
   The condensation rate is calculated using \( m_dot = \frac{Q}{h_{fg}} \), where \( h_{fg} \) is the latent heat of vaporization. At 105°F, \( h_{fg} \approx 958 \, \text{Btu/lb} \). For option E:  
   \[
   m_dot = \frac{123,021}{958} \approx 128.4 \, \text{lb/hr}
   \]  
   However, option E lists \( m_dot = 94.3 \, \text{lb/hr} \), which is lower than the calculated value. This discrepancy suggests a possible mismatch in the problem's assumptions or data.

5. **Evaluation of Options**:  
   Testing other options reveals inconsistencies in either \( Q \), \( U \), or \( m_dot \). Option E aligns most closely with the calculated \( Q \) and \( U \), despite the mismatch in \( m_dot \). Given the provided data and calculations, option E is the most plausible.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the most consistent answer with the given data is:

**Answer: E**
