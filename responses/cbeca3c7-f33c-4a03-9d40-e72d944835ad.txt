Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about calculating the normality of a sulfuric acid solution. Hmm, let's see. I remember that normality is a measure of concentration, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact details. I think normality is related to the number of equivalents of solute per liter of solution.

The problem gives me 2.45 grams of sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄) in 2.00 liters of solution. The molecular weight (MW) of H₂SO₄ is 98.1 g/mol. I need to find the normality, so I should probably start by finding out how many equivalents of H₂SO₄ are in that solution.

Wait, what's an equivalent again? Oh right, for acids, an equivalent is the number of moles times the number of H+ ions it can donate. Sulfuric acid is a strong acid, and I think it's diprotic, meaning it can donate two H+ ions per molecule. So each mole of H₂SO₄ provides 2 equivalents of H+.

So first, I need to calculate the number of moles of H₂SO₄. Moles are calculated by mass divided by molecular weight. So 2.45 grams divided by 98.1 g/mol. Let me do that: 2.45 / 98.1. Hmm, let's see, 98.1 is roughly 100, so 2.45 / 100 is about 0.0245. But more accurately, 98.1 is a bit less than 100, so the result will be a bit higher. Let me calculate it: 98.1 * 0.025 is about 2.4525. Wait, because 98.1 * 0.025 = 2.4525 g. So 2.45 grams is almost exactly 0.025 moles. Wait, wait, let me check: 0.025 * 98.1 = 2.4525. The given mass is 2.45 grams, which is slightly less than that. So maybe 0.025 moles is a good approximation. Let me compute it precisely: 2.45 /98.1 = approximately 0.02497 moles. So about 0.025 moles.

Since each mole gives 2 equivalents, the number of equivalents is 0.025 moles * 2 = 0.05 equivalents. Wait, that's per 2 liters of solution. So the normality (N) is equivalents per liter. So 0.05 equivalents in 2.00 liters would be 0.05 / 2 = 0.025 N? Wait, but wait, that doesn't match any of the options. Wait, let me double-check.

Wait, no, no. Because 0.025 moles times 2 gives 0.05 equivalents in 2 liters. So per liter, it's 0.05 / 2 = 0.025 equivalents per liter. So the normality would be 0.025 N. Looking at the options, option F is 0.025. So that's the answer. But wait, I think I might have made a mistake. Let me go through it again.

Wait, normality for H₂SO₄ is calculated based on H+ equivalents. So each mole of H₂SO₄ gives 2 moles of H+. So moles of H₂SO₄ is 2.45g /98.1 g/mol. Let me compute that accurately: 2.45 divided by 98.1.

Calculating 2.45 /98.1: Let's see, 98.1 is approximately 98. Let's compute 2.45 ÷98. Well, 98 * 0.025 is 2.45, right? Because 0.025 * 100 is 2.5, so 0.025 *98=2.45. So 2.45 /98.1 is approximately 0.02497, which is about 0.025 moles.

So moles = 0.025. Equivalents = 0.025 * 2 = 0.05 equivalents in 2 liters. So normality is 0.05 equivalents /2 liters = 0.025 N. So that's option F.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes normality is calculated based on the number of H+ ions, but I think I did it right. Let me make sure. For sulfuric acid, each molecule donates two H+ ions, so each mole contributes two equivalents. So yes, 0.025 moles *2 = 0.05 equivalents in 2 liters, so 0.025 N. That's correct.

Looking at the options again, option F is 0.025. So the answer should be F.

To calculate the normality of the solution, we start by determining the number of moles of sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄) using the given mass and molecular weight. The mass of H₂SO₄ is 2.45 g, and the molecular weight is 98.1 g/mol. 

\[
\text{Moles of } \text{H}_2\text{SO}_4 = \frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Molecular Weight}} = \frac{2.45}{98.1} \approx 0.025 \, \text{moles}.
\]

Since sulfuric acid is a diprotic acid, each mole of H₂SO₄ provides 2 equivalents of H⁺ ions. Therefore, the total number of equivalents is:

\[
\text{Equivalents} = \text{Moles} \times 2 = 0.025 \times 2 = 0.05 \, \text{equivalents}.
\]

The solution volume is 2.00 liters, so the normality (N), which is equivalents per liter, is:

\[
\text{Normality} = \frac{\text{Equivalents}}{\text{Volume in liters}} = \frac{0.05}{2.00} = 0.025 \, \text{equiv/L}.
\]

Thus, the normality of the solution is **0.025 equiv/L**, corresponding to option **F**.
