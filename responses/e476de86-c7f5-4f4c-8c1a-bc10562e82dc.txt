Okay, so I've got this genetics problem to solve. Let me try to understand it step by step. The question is about how many generations it takes for the frequency of a mutant allele to increase from 2% to 3%. The mutation rate is given as 2 × 10^-6 per generation. Also, it's stated that there are no other forces acting on the alleles, and mating is random. 

Hmm, right. So, I remember that when a new mutation arises and there are no other evolutionary forces like selection, genetic drift, or migration, the change in allele frequency can be modeled using a simple formula. Since the mutation is from a dominant allele C to recessive c, and assuming that the population is large and mating is random, I think this is a case where the change in allele frequency due to mutation is small and can be approximated.

Wait, but in this scenario, are we considering that the mutant allele c is being produced each generation, and the wild type C is mutating into c at a rate of 2e-6 per generation. So, the change in frequency each generation would be equal to the mutation rate because there's no selection against or for the allele. Also, since we're starting with 2% and going to 3%, which is a 1% increase, but the mutation rate is per allele per generation, so I need to see how it accumulates.

Wait, maybe I should model this as a simple change over time. The formula for the change in allele frequency when only mutation is involved is delta p = mutation rate per generation. But wait, that's only if the population is in an infinite size, right? Because otherwise, genetic drift would play a role, but since the problem says no other forces, I guess we're considering only mutation.

Wait, but if the initial frequency is p, then each generation, the frequency increases by the mutation rate (assuming no back mutation and no selection). So, the change per generation is delta p = mu, where mu is the mutation rate from C to c.

So, the initial frequency p0 is 0.02 (2%), and we want to reach p = 0.03 (3%). The change needed is 0.01. Since each generation, the change is 2e-6, then the number of generations t would be t = (p - p0) / mu.

Wait, but wait a second. That formula assumes that the population is large enough that the change is linear, which is true when the mutation rate is very low, which it is here (2e-6 is 0.0002%). So, let's compute that.

So, delta p is 0.03 - 0.02 = 0.01. The mutation rate mu is 2e-6 per generation. So, t = 0.01 / (2e-6) = 0.01 / 0.000002.

Calculating that: 0.01 divided by 0.000002. Let me compute that. 0.01 is 1e-2. 0.000002 is 2e-6. So, 1e-2 / 2e-6 = (1/2) * 1e4 = 5e3, which is 5,000. Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see 5,000. The options are A:2500, B:6200, C:15000, D:8764, E:10000, F:20000, G:3000, H:1000, I:7500, J:5128.

Wait, 5000 isn't there, but option J is 5128, which is close. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the approach. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the mutation rate is per allele per generation, so each allele has a 2e-6 chance to mutate. So, for a diploid organism, each individual has two alleles, so per individual, the mutation rate would be 2 * 2e-6, but wait, no, because the question says the mutation frequency is 2e-6 per generation per allele. So each allele has a 2e-6 chance to mutate each generation.

Wait, but when calculating allele frequency change, the formula is mu = (p(t+1) - p(t)) / (1), so each generation, the change in p is approximately mu, assuming no other factors. So, if the initial p is 0.02, each generation increases by 2e-6. So, to go from 0.02 to 0.03, that's a 0.01 increase. So, t = 0.01 / (2e-6) = 5e3, which is 5000 generations.

But 5000 isn't an option. The closest is J:5128. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is a bit different. Let me consider the exact formula for allele frequency change under mutation.

In the absence of selection, the change in allele frequency per generation when only mutation is considered (and if mutation is one-way, say from C to c), then the change would be:

p(t+1) = p(t) + mu*(1-p(t)) - v*p(t)

where v is the back mutation rate from c to C. But in this problem, it's stated that the mutation is from C to c, and there's no mention of back mutation, so v=0. So, the change is simply p(t+1) = p(t) + mu.

Wait, but that would mean each generation, p increases by mu. So, to go from 0.02 to 0.03, the total change needed is 0.01. So, t = 0.01 / mu = 0.01 / (2e-6) = 5000 generations.

But again, the options don't have 5000. So perhaps I'm missing something. Wait, maybe the mutation rate is per individual, not per allele. Let me check the question again.

The question says, "A gene C mutates to c with a frequency of 2 × 10^-6 per generation." Hmm, that wording is a bit ambiguous. It could be per allele or per individual. If it's per individual, then for diploid organisms, each individual has two alleles, so the per allele mutation rate would be (2e-6) per individual per generation. Wait, but that's not how I usually see it. Typically, mutation rates are given per allele.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutation rate is 2e-6 per allele per generation. So, the total number of mutations per generation in the population would be the allele frequency times the mutation rate. Wait, but maybe that's not the right way to think about it. Let me think again.

If the mutation rate is 2e-6 per allele per generation, then each allele has a 2e-6 chance to mutate to c each generation. So, the change in the frequency of c per generation would be mu, because each C allele has a chance to become c. But wait, if the initial frequency is p (C) and q (c), then the new q would be q + mu*p, assuming no back mutation.

Wait, so the change in q per generation is delta q = mu * p. Since p = 1 - q (if we're only considering two alleles), then delta q = mu*(1 - q). So, the change isn't constant; it depends on the current frequency.

Ah, that's a crucial point. So, if q is small, delta q is approximately mu, but as q increases, the rate of change slows down because delta q = mu*(1 - q).

So, in this problem, since we're starting at q=0.02, which is 2%, and going to q=0.03, which is 3%, the change is small, but perhaps we can't ignore the fact that the rate of change decreases as q increases.

Wait, so the differential equation would be dq/dt = mu*(1 - q). So, solving this differential equation:

dq/dt = mu (1 - q)
Separate variables:

dq/(1 - q) = mu dt
Integrate both sides:

- ln(1 - q) = mu t + C

At t=0, q=0.02, so:

- ln(1 - 0.02) = C
C = - ln(0.98) ≈ 0.020202706...

At time t when q=0.03:

- ln(1 - 0.03) = mu t + C
- ln(0.97) = mu t - ln(0.98)
So, mu t = ln(0.97) + ln(0.98)
Wait, ln(0.97) is negative, and ln(0.98) is also negative. Alternatively, perhaps I should write:

ln(1 - q_final) = mu t + ln(1 - q_initial)
Wait, wait, let me correct that. The integration should be:

ln(1/(1 - q)) = mu t + C?

Wait, let me re-do the integration correctly.

The integral of dq/(1 - q) is -ln(1 - q) + C.

So,

- ln(1 - q) = mu t + C.

At t=0, q = 0.02:

- ln(1 - 0.02) = C
C = - ln(0.98) ≈ 0.0202027.

At time t, q = 0.03:

- ln(1 - 0.03) = mu t + (- ln(0.98))
So,

- ln(0.97) = mu t - ln(0.98)
Rearranged:

mu t = ln(0.97) + ln(0.98)
But wait, that would be negative plus negative, which is more negative.

Wait, no, perhaps I should rearrange differently.

Let me think again:

At t=0: - ln(0.98) = C.

At t=T: - ln(0.97) = mu T + C.

Substituting C:

- ln(0.97) = mu T - ln(0.98)

So, mu T = - ln(0.97) + ln(0.98)

But wait, ln(0.98) is a negative number, so adding another negative would make it more negative. That can't be right because mu is positive and T should be positive.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the integration limits. Let me check again.

The integral was:

∫ dq/(1 - q) from q=0.02 to q=0.03 equals ∫ mu dt from 0 to T.

So,

∫ from 0.02 to 0.03 of dq/(1 - q) = mu * T.

The left side is:

-ln(1 - q) evaluated from 0.02 to 0.03 = -ln(0.97) - (-ln(0.98)) )= ln(0.98) - ln(0.97).

Which is ln(0.98/0.97) ≈ ln(1.010309) ≈ 0.01026.

So, mu * T = 0.01026.

Given mu = 2e-6, T = 0.01026 / (2e-6) ≈ 5130 generations.

Looking at the options, J is 5128, which is very close. So the correct answer would be J:5128.

To determine how many generations are needed for the frequency of the mutant allele \( c \) to increase from 2% to 3%, we model the change in allele frequency under mutation. The mutation rate is \( \mu = 2 \times 10^{-6} \) per allele per generation, and there are no other evolutionary forces acting.

The change in allele frequency per generation is given by:

\[
\Delta q = \mu (1 - q)
\]

where \( q \) is the frequency of the \( c \) allele. To solve for the time \( T \) required to increase \( q \) from 0.02 to 0.03, we use the differential equation:

\[
\frac{dq}{dt} = \mu (1 - q)
\]

Separating variables and integrating:

\[
\int_{0.02}^{0.03} \frac{dq}{1 - q} = \int_{0}^{T} \mu \, dt
\]

The left-hand side evaluates to:

\[
-\ln(1 - q) \Big|_{0.02}^{0.03} = \ln\left(\frac{0.98}{0.97}\right) \approx 0.01026
\]

The right-hand side is:

\[
\mu T
\]

Equating the two:

\[
\mu T = 0.01026
\]

Solving for \( T \):

\[
T = \frac{0.01026}{2 \times 10^{-6}} \approx 5130 \text{ generations}
\]

The closest option is **J: 5128 generations**.
