Answer:
    
<think>
Okay, so I have this logic problem to solve. It involves two propositions, and I need to determine their logical relationship using truth tables. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the problem gives two statements:

1. (~M ⊃ ~N) ∨ (O ≡ N)
2. (~M · N) · [(~O ∨ ~N) · (O ∨ N)]

I need to construct truth tables for each and then see if they're logically equivalent, contradictory, consistent, or inconsistent.

Wait, I'm a bit confused about what each part means. Let me start by parsing the propositions.

Starting with the first one: (~M ⊃ ~N) ∨ (O ≡ N). So, that's a disjunction of two parts. The first part is a conditional statement: if not M, then not N. The second part is a biconditional: O if and only if N. So the whole first statement is true if either the conditional is true or the biconditional is true.

The second proposition is more complex: (~M · N) · [(~O ∨ ~N) · (O ∨ N)]. Let's parse this. It looks like a conjunction of two parts. The first part is (~M · N), which is "not M and N". The second part is another conjunction: [(~O ∨ ~N) · (O ∨ N)]. So that's (not O or not N) and (O or N). Wait, that second part could be simplified, maybe? Because (A ∨ B) ∧ (¬A ∨ ¬B) is a known logical form. Hmm.

I think I should create a truth table with all possible truth values for M, N, O. Since there are three variables, there are 8 possible combinations. Let's list them as rows.

I'll set up the columns:

M | N | O | (~M ⊃ ~N) | (O ≡ N) | (~M ⊃ ~N) ∨ (O ≡ N) | (~M · N) | (~O ∨ ~N) | (O ∨ N) | [ (~O ∨ ~N) ∧ (O ∨ N) ] | (~M · N) ∧ [ ... ]

Wait, that's a lot, but let's proceed methodically.

First, the main connectives. For each row, compute each part step by step.

Let's go through each row one by one.

Row 1: M=T, N=T, O=T

Compute each part:

1. (~M ⊃ ~N): M=F, N=F. So F → F, which is T.
2. (O ≡ N): T ≡ T, so T.
3. So (~M ⊃ ~N) ∨ (O ≡ N) is T ∨ T = T.

Now the second proposition:

4. (~M · N): F · T = F.
5. (~O ∨ ~N): F ∨ F = F.
6. (O ∨ N): T ∨ T = T.
7. So [ (~O ∨ ~N) · (O ∨ N) ] = F · T = F.
8. Then, (~M · N) · [ ... ] = F · F = F.

So for row 1, first prop is T, second is F.

Row 2: M=T, N=T, O=F

1. (~M ⊃ ~N): F → F = T.
2. (O ≡ N): F ≡ T = F.
3. So first prop: T ∨ F = T.
4. (~M · N): F · T = F.
5. (~O ∨ ~N): T ∨ F = T.
6. (O ∨ N): F ∨ T = T.
7. [T · T] = T.
8. (~M · N) · T = F · T = F.

So row 2: first prop T, second F.

Row 3: M=T, N=F, O=T

1. (~M ⊃ ~N): F → T = T.
2. (O ≡ N): T ≡ F = F.
3. First prop: T ∨ F = T.
4. (~M · N): F · F = F.
5. (~O ∨ ~N): F ∨ T = T.
6. (O ∨ N): T ∨ F = T.
7. [T · T] = T.
8. F · T = F.

Row 3: both T and F.

Wait, first prop is T, second F.

Row 4: M=T, N=F, O=F

1. (~M ⊃ ~N): F → T = T.
2. (O ≡ N): F ≡ F = T.
3. First prop: T ∨ T = T.
4. (~M · N): F · F = F.
5. (~O ∨ ~N): T ∨ T = T.
6. (O ∨ N): F ∨ F = F.
7. [T · F] = F.
8. F · F = F.

So row 4: first prop T, second F.

Now row 5: M=F, N=T, O=T

1. (~M ⊃ ~N): T → F = F.
2. (O ≡ N): T ≡ T = T.
3. First prop: F ∨ T = T.
4. (~M · N): T · T = T.
5. (~O ∨ ~N): F ∨ F = F.
6. (O ∨ N): T ∨ T = T.
7. [F · T] = F.
8. T · F = F.

Row 5: first prop T, second F.

Row 6: M=F, N=T, O=F

1. (~M ⊃ ~N): T → F = F.
2. (O ≡ N): F ≡ T = F.
3. First prop: F ∨ F = F.
4. (~M · N): T · T = T.
5. (~O ∨ ~N): T ∨ F = T.
6. (O ∨ N): F ∨ T = T.
7. [T · T] = T.
8. T · T = T.

So row 6: first prop F, second T.

Row 7: M=F, N=F, O=T

1. (~M ⊃ ~N): T → T = T.
2. (O ≡ N): T ≡ F = F.
3. First prop: T ∨ F = T.
4. (~M · N): T · F = F.
5. (~O ∨ ~N): F ∨ T = T.
6. (O ∨ N): T ∨ F = T.
7. [T · T] = T.
8. F · T = F.

Row 7: first prop T, second F.

Row 8: M=F, N=F, O=F

1. (~M ⊃ ~N): T → T = T.
2. (O ≡ N): F ≡ F = T.
3. First prop: T ∨ T = T.
4. (~M · N): T · F = F.
5. (~O ∨ ~N): T ∨ T = T.
6. (O ∨ N): F ∨ F = F.
7. [T · F] = F.
8. F · F = F.

So row 8: first prop T, second F.

Now, compiling the results:

Row | First Prop | Second Prop
--- | --- | ---
1 | T | F
2 | T | F
3 | T | F
4 | T | F
5 | T | F
6 | F | T
7 | T | F
8 | T | F

Wait, in row 6, first prop is F and second is T.

So now, let's see if the two propositions are logically equivalent. That would require that both are true or both are false in all rows. But looking at the results, the first proposition is T in all rows except row 6, where it's F. The second proposition is F in rows 1-5,7,8, and only T in row 6.

So, let's check if they are equivalent: For equivalence, whenever one is T, the other must also be T, and vice versa. Here, in row 6, first is F, second is T. So they are not equivalent.

Next, are they contradictory? Contradictory means that whenever one is T, the other is F, and vice versa. But in this case, in rows 1-5,7,8, both are F for the second proposition and T for the first. So the second prop is F while the first is T in most cases. But in row 6, first is F, second is T. So their truth values aren't always opposite. So they are not contradictory.

Now, are they consistent? Consistency in logic usually refers to whether they can be true at the same time. If there's a row where both are T, they are consistent. But looking at the table, in all rows, first prop is T when second is F, and in row 6, first is F and second is T. There's no row where both are T. So they are never both true at the same time, which means they are consistent only if they can be true together. Wait, no—actually, consistency means that there's at least one row where both are true. If not, they are inconsistent.

Wait, I think I might be mixing terms. Let me clarify: If two propositions are consistent, it means they can be true together without contradiction. If there is no row where both are true, then they are inconsistent. So in this case, in all rows, when one is T, the other is F. So they are mutually exclusive. Therefore, they are inconsistent.

Wait, but wait. Let me check the definitions again. Logical equivalence means they have identical truth tables. Contradiction means they are always opposite (equivalent to false). If they are neither equivalent nor contradictory, then they might be consistent or inconsistent.

So in this case, the two propositions are not equivalent and not contradictory. Because they're not always the same, nor always opposites. But are they consistent? Consistency means that there's at least one row where both are true. If not, they're inconsistent.

Looking at the truth table, in all rows, either the first is T and the second F, or vice versa. There's no row where both are T. So they are never true at the same time. Therefore, they are inconsistent.

Wait, but wait another moment. Let me check row 6 again. In row 6: M=F, N=T, O=F.

First proposition: (~M → ~N) is F → F, which is T. (O ≡ N) is F ≡ T, which is F. So the first prop is T ∨ F = T. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, no: wait, in row 6, M=F, N=T, O=F.

Wait, I think I made a mistake in row 6's first proposition earlier. Let me re-calculate row 6:

First proposition: (~M ⊃ ~N) ∨ (O ≡ N).

M=F → ~M=T. N=T → ~N=F.

So (~M → ~N) is T → F, which is F.

(O ≡ N): O=F, N=T → F ≡ T is F.

So F ∨ F is F. So first prop is F.

Second proposition: (~M · N) · [(~O ∨ ~N) · (O ∨ N)].

~M=T, N=T → (~M · N)=T·T=T.

Now, compute [(~O ∨ ~N) · (O ∨ N)].

~O=T (since O=F), ~N=F. So (~O ∨ ~N) = T ∨ F = T.

(O ∨ N) = F ∨ T = T.

So (T · T) = T.

So the second part is T. So overall, (~M · N) · [ ... ] = T · T = T.

So row 6: first prop=F, second=T.

So indeed, in all rows, when first prop is T, second is F, and when first is F, second is T. So they are always opposite. Wait, that would make them contradictory, because they can't be true at the same time. But wait, no, because contradiction requires that one is the negation of the other. So if they are always opposite, they are contradictory.

Wait, but earlier I thought they are not contradictory. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake earlier.

Let me re-examine. The first proposition is (~M→~N) ∨ (O≡N). Let's see if it's equivalent to the negation of the second.

Wait, the second proposition is (~M · N) · [ (~O ∨ ~N) · (O ∨ N) ].

Wait, perhaps there is a way to simplify both propositions.

Alternatively, perhaps I should check if the two propositions are always negations of each other, which would make them contradictory.

Looking at the truth table, in all rows except row 6, first prop is T and second is F. In row 6, first is F, second is T. So in every row, they are opposite. So that would mean they are contradictory.

Wait, but earlier I thought that they are not equivalent because in row 6, first is F, second is T. But if in every row, they are opposite, then they are always contradictory, meaning their truth values are always opposite. So that would make them contradictory.

Wait, but earlier I thought that in row 6, first prop is F and second is T. So in all rows, the first prop is the negation of the second. So that would make them contradictory.

Wait, but let me check the truth table again.

Looking at the rows:

Row 1: first T, second F.

Row 2: T, F.

Row 3: T, F.

Row 4: T, F.

Row 5: T, F.

Row 6: F, T.

Row 7: T, F.

Row 8: T, F.

So in every row, the first prop is the negation of the second. So that would mean that the first proposition is equivalent to the negation of the second. So they are contradictory.

Wait, but I thought that in row 6, first is F, second is T, which is the opposite of all other rows. So if in every row, they are opposite, then they are contradictory.

So that would mean the answer is D: Contradictory.

Wait, but let me make sure. Let me see if for all rows, the first proposition is the opposite of the second.

Yes, looking at all eight rows, whenever the first is T, the second is F, and vice versa. So they are always contradictory.

So the answer would be D: Contradictory.
</think>

The two propositions are always contradictory because in every possible scenario, one is true while the other is false.
