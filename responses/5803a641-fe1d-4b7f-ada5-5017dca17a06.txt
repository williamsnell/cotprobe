Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about Mr. Gordon and his brain injury. The question says he damaged the back of his right frontal lobe. I remember that the brain has different lobes, each responsible for different functions. The frontal lobe is involved in a lot of things, like movement, planning, and some aspects of language.

Wait, the question is about what he can't do now. The options are from A to J, each a different ability. Let me think about each option.

Option A: Recognize faces. I think that's the temporal lobe, specifically the fusiform face area. So damage there would cause prosopagnosia, but that's not the frontal lobe. So probably not A.

Option B: Move his left hand. The frontal lobe controls motor functions. The right frontal lobe controls the left side of the body. So if he can't move his left hand, that could be it. But wait, the question says he's unable to do something, so maybe this is possible. But I'm not sure if it's the back part of the frontal lobe.

Option C: Hear sounds correctly. Hearing is handled by the temporal lobe, right? So damage there would affect hearing, but he's damaged the frontal lobe, so probably not C.

Option D: Understand information he reads. Reading comprehension is more about the temporal lobe, especially the left temporal lobe in language processing. So maybe not D.

Option E: Speak intelligibly. Speaking involves Broca's area, which is in the frontal lobe, specifically the left frontal lobe. But he's damaging the right frontal lobe, so maybe it's not E because Broca's area is on the left. So if he can't speak, it's usually the left side. So E might not be the answer.

Option F: Taste food properly. Taste is handled by the brainstem, I think. So F is probably not related.

Option G: Understand information he hears. That's Wernicke's area, which is in the temporal lobe, not the frontal. So G is not the answer.

Option H: See clearly. Vision is the occipital lobe. So H is out.

Option I: Feel temperature changes. That's the parietal lobe. So I don't think it's I.

Option J: Smell different scents. Smell is handled by the temporal lobe or limbic system. So J isn't it.

Wait, so going back. The right frontal lobe is damaged. The right side controls the left side of the body. So movement of the left hand would be affected if the right frontal lobe is damaged. But the question is about what he's unable to do. So B is about moving his left hand. But I'm not sure if that's the only function.

Wait, another thought. The question says the back of the right frontal lobe. The frontal lobe has different areas. The motor cortex is at the front, and as you go back, it's more associative areas. So the back part might not be directly for motor function but perhaps for higher functions like planning or maybe language.

Wait, Broca's area is in the left frontal lobe. So if the right frontal lobe is damaged, maybe it's related to language processing but not speech production. Or maybe it's related to other functions, like facial recognition or something else.

Wait, another possibility: if the right frontal lobe is damaged, could it affect the ability to understand information he hears or reads? Or perhaps the ability to process language in another way? Or maybe it's about movement.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The frontal lobe is divided into parts. The precentral gyrus is for motor functions. So the back part of the frontal lobe might be more about higher functions, like decision-making, planning, or even aspects of language.

But the options given don't really include those. The options are about basic functions: moving, recognizing, hearing, etc.

Wait, the question says he's unable to do something. So if the right frontal lobe is damaged, the left side of the body is affected. So moving the left hand (option B) could be an issue.

But wait, another angle: the right hemisphere is more involved in spatial processing and some aspects of language, but not as much in motor control for speech. Wait, but the motor for the left hand is in the right frontal lobe.

So if the right frontal lobe is damaged, he can't move the left hand, so B is possible.

Alternatively, if the back of the frontal lobe is damaged, perhaps it's the supplementary motor area or something else. But I'm not sure.

Another thought: The question is about what he's unable to do. So if the right frontal lobe is damaged, he might have weakness on the left side, so B is correct.

Wait, but the question is about the last character, so the options are A through J, each a different function.

So I think the answer is B: move his left hand.

The question involves Mr. Gordon, who has suffered damage to the back of his right frontal lobe. The frontal lobe is responsible for motor functions, among other things, and the right frontal lobe controls the left side of the body. Damage to this area would likely result in difficulty moving the left hand. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J**: These options relate to functions controlled by other brain regions (e.g., temporal, parietal, occipital lobes, or brainstem). They are unlikely to be affected by damage to the right frontal lobe.

- **B**: The right frontal lobe controls motor functions on the left side of the body. Damage here would impair movement of the left hand.

Thus, the correct answer is **B**.

Answer: B
