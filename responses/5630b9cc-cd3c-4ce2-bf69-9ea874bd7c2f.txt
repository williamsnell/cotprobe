Okay, so I have this question here: Let x = 8. What is x >> 1 in Python 3? The options are from A to J, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my bitwise operations, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that the >> operator is the right shift operator. Right shifting a number is like dividing it by two and discarding any remainder, but I think it's actually equivalent to multiplying by a power of two. Wait, no, right shift means moving the bits to the right, which effectively divides the number by 2 for each shift. So shifting right by 1 would be the same as integer division by 2.

Let me take x = 8. The binary representation of 8 is 1000. If I shift this right by 1, the bits move to the right, and the least significant bit (the rightmost bit) is discarded. So shifting 1000 right by one would give me 100, which is 4 in decimal. So x >> 1 should be 4.

Wait, let me double-check. So in binary, 8 is 1000. Shifting right by one: each bit moves right, and the leftmost bit is filled with a zero because it's an unsigned shift. So 1000 becomes 0100, which is 4. Yeah, that makes sense. So the result should be 4, which is option E.

I think I'm confident with that. So the answer should be E.

The right shift operator (>>) in Python shifts the bits of the number to the right. For x = 8, which is 1000 in binary, shifting right by 1 results in 100, which is 4 in decimal.
