Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an electric lamp connected to a power line. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my electrical formulas, but I'll give it a shot.

The question says: A 60-ohm electric lamp is left connected to a 240-volt line for 3.00 minutes. How much energy is taken from the line? The options are given from A to J.

First, I remember that electrical energy can be calculated using the formula for power multiplied by time. Oh right, the formula is Energy (E) equals Power (P) multiplied by Time (t), so E = P * t.

But wait, I need to find the power first. Power in an electrical circuit can be found using different formulas. The most common ones are P = V * I (voltage times current), P = I² * R (current squared times resistance), or P = V² / R (voltage squared divided by resistance). Since I know the voltage (V) and the resistance (R), I think the third formula would be the easiest to use here.

So, V is 240 volts, R is 60 ohms. Plugging those into the formula: P = (240)^2 / 60. Let me calculate that. 240 squared is 240 * 240. Hmm, 24*24 is 576, so 240 squared is 57,600. Then divide that by 60. 57,600 divided by 60 equals 960. So the power is 960 watts.

Wait, watts? That seems a bit high for a lamp, but maybe it's correct. Let me double-check the calculation. 240 squared is indeed 57,600. Divided by 60 gives 960, yes. So P is 960 W.

Now, the time is given as 3 minutes. Oh, I need to convert that into seconds because the energy is usually in joules, which uses seconds. Wait, no, actually, in the formula E = P * t, the units depend. If P is in watts (which is joules per second), then t should be in seconds. So 3 minutes is 3 * 60 = 180 seconds.

So now, E = 960 J/s * 180 s. Let me compute that. 960 * 180. Hmm, 960 * 100 is 96,000. 960 * 80 is 76,800. Adding them together gives 96,000 + 76,800 = 172,800 joules.

Wait, but looking at the options, none of them exactly match 172,800. Let me check the options again. Option D is 1.72 × 10^4 J, which is 17,200 J. Hmm, that's way less than what I calculated. Did I make a mistake somewhere?

Let me go back. Did I get the time right? The time was 3 minutes, so 180 seconds. That's correct. Power calculation: 240^2 /60 = (57,600)/60 = 960 W. That seems right. So 960 * 180 = 172,800 J. But that's 1.728 × 10^5 J. Wait, none of the options go that high. The highest option is J: 2.4 × 10^4 which is 24,000 J. So I must have messed up somewhere.

Wait a second, maybe I used the wrong formula. Let me think again. Oh! Maybe the formula for power is different. Another approach: Power can also be calculated as P = V * I, but I don't have the current. Alternatively, using Ohm's law, I can find the current first. Oh, right! I should compute the current using I = V/R. V is 240, R is 60, so I = 240 /60 = 4 A. Then, Power P = V * I = 240 * 4 = 960 W. Same result as before.

Hmm, so energy calculation seems correct. But the options don't have that number. Maybe I'm converting the time wrong? Wait, 3 minutes is 180 seconds. Wait, unless the question expects the time in minutes but uses a different formula. Alternatively, perhaps I should use kilowatt-hours? Oh, right! Because in real life, electricity bills are in kilowatt-hours. 1 kilowatt-hour is 3.6 million joules, but maybe the question expects the answer in kilowatt-hours and then converted to joules.

Wait, but the options are in joules. Let me think again. Did I miscalculate the power? Let me check 240^2 /60 again. 240 squared is 57,600. Divided by 60 is indeed 960. So 960 watts.

Wait, but 3 minutes is 0.05 hours (since 3/60 = 0.05). So energy in kilowatt-hours would be 0.96 kW * 0.05 hours = 0.048 kWh. To convert to joules: 0.048 kWh * 3.6e6 J/kWh = 172,800 J. Same as before.

But the options don't have that. Wait, looking back at the options, option B is 3.6e4 J (36,000), option D is 1.72e4 (17,200), and J is 2.4e4 (24,000). Hmm, none match 172,800. Did I perhaps make a mistake in the power calculation?

Wait, maybe I used the wrong formula. Maybe it's not V^2/R, but I^2*R. Let me try that. I already calculated I as 4 A. So I^2 is 16 A². 16 * R (60) is 960 W. Same result. So that can't be the issue.

Wait, perhaps the time was given in minutes but I should use hours? But that doesn't make sense. 3 minutes is a short time. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to calculate using average power or something else? I'm a bit confused because my answer isn't matching any of the options.

Wait, let me check the options again. Oh, option D is 1.72 × 10^4, which is 17,200. But my calculation is 172,800, which is ten times larger. Oh! Wait, did I forget to convert something? Oh, no. Wait, maybe the resistance was 600 ohms instead of 60? Because 240^2 /600 would be (57600)/600 = 96 W. Then 96 * 180 = 17,280 J, which is approximately 1.728e4 J. So that would match option D.

But the problem states the lamp is 60 ohms, not 600. So I'm confused. Did I read the question wrong? Let me check: "60-ohm electric lamp". Yes, 60 ohms. So perhaps the correct calculation is 172,800 J, but that's not an option. So maybe I made a mistake in the time conversion.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the energy is calculated in watt-minutes and then converted. Let me see. 3 minutes is 0.05 hours. If power is 960 W, then energy in kWh is 960 * 0.05 = 48 kWh? No, wait, that's not right. Wait, 960 W is 0.96 kW. So 0.96 kW * 0.05 hours = 0.048 kWh. 0.048 kWh is 0.048 * 3.6e6 J = 172,800 J.

Hmm. Maybe the options have a typo? But since the options don't include 1.728e5 J, perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe I should calculate using the formula E = V * I * t. Let's try that.

We have V=240 V, I=4 A, t=180 s. So E = 240 *4 *180. Let's compute that. 240 *4 is 960. 960 *180 = 172,800 J. Same as before.

I'm stuck. The correct calculation leads me to 172,800 J, but the options don't have that. Let me look at the options again. Oh, wait! Option D is 1.72 ×10^4 J, which is 17,200 J. Hmm, that's exactly a tenth of my result. Did I maybe miscalculate the power? Let me check the power calculation again.

Wait, 240 V divided by 60 ohms is 4 A. Then, power is V * I = 240 *4 = 960 W. So that's correct.

Wait a second, perhaps I made a mistake in the time. 3 minutes is 180 seconds. But if I mistakenly took it as 3 hours, that would be wrong. No, the time is definitely 3 minutes.

Wait, maybe the formula for energy is different. Oh, wait another formula: E = (V^2 * t) / R. Let's try that. So E = (240^2 * 180) /60. Let me compute that. 240^2 is 57,600. 57,600 *180 = 10,368,000. Divided by 60 is 172,800 J. Same result.

I'm really confused. The calculation seems correct, but the options don't have it. Maybe the options are in kilojoules? 172,800 J is 172.8 kJ. But the options are in 10^4 J, so 172.8 kJ is 1.728 ×10^5 J. Not matching any option.

Wait, perhaps I should recalculate the power. Let me compute 240^2: 240 * 240. Let me do it step by step. 200*200=40,000. 200*40=8,000. 40*200=8,000. 40*40=1,600. Wait, no, that's the expansion for (200+40)^2 = 200² + 2*200*40 +40²=40,000 + 16,000 +1,600=57,600. Correct.

So, 57,600 divided by 60 is 960. Correct.

Hmm. Maybe the question expects the time in minutes but uses a different approach. Alternatively, perhaps the question has a typo, but I can't change that. Let me look at the options again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial formula. Maybe the formula for energy is E = (V^2 * t)/R. So E = (240^2 * 180)/60. Let me compute that again: 240^2=57,600. 57,600 *180 = 10,368,000. Divided by 60 is 172,800 J. Same result.

I'm going in circles. Maybe the intended answer is option D, 1.72 ×10^4 J, which is 17,200 J. But according to my calculations, it's 1.728 ×10^5 J. Unless I messed up the exponent, perhaps I should check that. Oh! Wait a minute, 172,800 J is 1.728 ×10^5 J, but none of the options have that. The closest is option J: 2.4e4 (24,000), which is about 24,000, far less than 172,800.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the resistance value. The lamp is 60 ohms. Did I read that correctly? Yes. Maybe the voltage is 24 volts instead of 240? That would change things. Let me check the question again. It says 240 volts. So that's correct.

I'm stuck. I think my calculation is correct, but since the options don't match, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Alternatively, maybe the question expects the use of average power or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the time was 3 hours instead of 3 minutes, but that would make the energy much higher. Wait, 3 hours is 180 minutes, which would be 10,800 seconds. 960 * 10,800 is 10,368,000 J, which is 1.0368e7 J, not matching any option.

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the time is 3 seconds? But the question says 3 minutes. I'm really confused now. Maybe I should pick the closest option. But none are close. Alternatively, perhaps I should think about using the formula E = I² * R * t. I is 4 A, R is 60, t is 180. So 4²=16. 16*60=960. 960 *180 =172,800 J. Same as before.

Wait, maybe the problem expects the answer in kilojoules, so 172.8 kJ, which is 1.728 ×10^5 J. But the options are in 10^4 J, so 1.728e5 would be 17.28 ×10^4 J, which is 1.728e5 = 172,800 J. But the options don't have that. The highest is J: 2.4e4=24,000 J.

I'm really stuck. Maybe I should recheck the calculations once more. Let me write down all the steps clearly:

1. Voltage (V) = 240 V
2. Resistance (R) = 60 ohms
3. Time (t) = 3 minutes = 180 seconds

Power (P) using P = V^2 / R:
P = (240)^2 / 60 = 57,600 /60 = 960 W.

Energy (E) = P * t = 960 W * 180 s = 172,800 J.

But the options don't include this. The closest is D:1.72e4 J, which is 17,200 J. That's exactly a tenth of my result. Wait, maybe I forgot to convert minutes to hours somewhere? Let me think. 3 minutes is 0.05 hours. If I mistakenly used hours instead of seconds, then E = 960 W * 0.05 h = 48 Wh. To convert to joules, 48 Wh * 3.6e3 J/Wh = 172,800 J. Same result.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use E = V * I * t, but again, same result.

Wait, perhaps the question intended the time to be 30 seconds instead of 3 minutes? Let me see. 30 seconds would make t=30 s. Then E=960*30=28,800 J, which is 2.88e4 J. Closest option is E:1.9e4 or J:2.4e4. Not matching exactly.

Alternatively, maybe the time is 3 hours? No, that would give 960 * 10800 = 10,368,000 J, which is way off.

I think I've exhausted all possibilities. Perhaps the intended answer is D:1.72e4 J, but I can't see where I would have made a mistake to get that. Alternatively, maybe I should look at the options again. Oh wait! Maybe I messed up the exponent when writing down my result. 172,800 J is 1.728 ×10^5 J, but perhaps the option D is written as 1.72 ×10^4 J, which is ten times smaller. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation and forgot a zero somewhere.

Wait, let me check the calculation again. 240^2 is 57,600. Divided by 60 is 960. 960 * 180 seconds. Let's compute 960 * 180:

960 * 180 = (900 * 180) + (60 *180)
900 *180 = 162,000
60 *180 = 10,800
Total = 162,000 + 10,800 = 172,800 J.

Yes, that's correct. So I'm confident my calculation is right, but the options don't match. Maybe the correct option is not listed, but among the options, D is the closest in the 1.7e4 range. But that's only 17,200 J, which is about a tenth of my result. I'm not sure. Maybe I made a mistake in the initial formula.

Wait, another thought: Did I use the correct formula for energy? Oh yes, E = P * t. But if I used E = (V^2 * t)/R, that's the same as P*t because P is V^2/R.

Hmm. I'm stuck. I think I'll go with my calculation and look for the closest option, but none match. Alternatively, perhaps the intended answer is D:1.72e4 J, but I can't see how that would be correct unless I made a mistake. Maybe I should double-check the initial formula.

Wait, maybe I should calculate using E = I² * R * t. I is 4 A. So 4^2=16. 16 *60=960. 960 *180=172,800 J.

Same result. I think I have to conclude that the correct answer isn't listed, but since that's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the time was 30 seconds, but the question says 3 minutes.

Wait, perhaps the question meant 3 hours? Let me check. 3 hours is 10,800 seconds. 960 *10,800=10,368,000 J, which is 1.0368e7 J. Not matching any options.

I'm really stuck. I think I'll have to go with my calculation and perhaps the intended answer is D:1.72e4 J, even though my calculation says 1.728e5 J. Maybe I made a mistake in the problem reading. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but given the options, I'll choose the closest one, which would be D.

To determine the energy consumed by the 60-ohm lamp connected to a 240-volt line for 3 minutes, the following steps are taken:

1. **Calculate Power (P):**  
   Using the formula \( P = \frac{V^2}{R} \):  
   \[
   P = \frac{240^2}{60} = \frac{57600}{60} = 960 \, \text{W}
   \]

2. **Convert Time to Seconds:**  
   The time is given as 3 minutes, which converts to \( 3 \times 60 = 180 \, \text{seconds} \).

3. **Calculate Energy (E):**  
   Using the formula \( E = P \times t \):  
   \[
   E = 960 \times 180 = 172800 \, \text{J}
   \]

4. **Compare with Options:**  
   The calculated energy is \( 172800 \, \text{J} \), which is \( 1.728 \times 10^5 \, \text{J} \). However, none of the provided options match this value. The closest option is **D: \( 1.72 \times 10^4 \, \text{J} \)**, which is approximately \( 17,200 \, \text{J} \). This is about a tenth of the calculated value, suggesting a possible discrepancy in the problem setup or options.

Given the calculations and the provided options, the best choice is **D**.

Answer: D
