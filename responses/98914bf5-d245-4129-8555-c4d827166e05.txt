Okay, so I've got this problem about shafts. A hollow shaft with an outer diameter of 5 inches is used instead of a solid shaft with a diameter of 3.8 inches. I need to find the inside diameter of the hollow shaft and the percentage of material saved by weight. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

I remember that for torsional strength, the key factor is the polar moment of inertia (J). The formula for J for a solid shaft is (π/2)*d^4/32, but wait, no, wait. Let me get that right. Oh yes, for a solid shaft, J = (π/2)*(d^4)/32, which simplifies to (π d^4)/64. Alternatively, sometimes I've seen it written as (π/32)*d^4. Either way, I think I can work with that.

For a hollow shaft, the polar moment of inertia is J = (π/2)*( (Do^4 - Di^4)/32 ). Wait, no, I think it's (π/2)*(Do^4 - Di^4)/32. Let me check that formula. Oh yes, correct. So J_hollow = (π/32) * (Do^4 - Di^4).

Since the hollow shaft is replacing the solid one and has the same torsional strength, their J values must be equal. So I can set the J of the solid shaft equal to the J of the hollow shaft.

So, J_solid = J_hollow.

Let me write that out:

(π/32) * (d_solid^4) = (π/32) * (Do^4 - Di^4)

Oh, wait, the π/32 cancels out on both sides. So we get:

d_solid^4 = Do^4 - Di^4

Wait, no, that's not right. Let me double-check. For the solid shaft, J is (π/32)*d_solid^4, and for the hollow, it's (π/32)*(Do^4 - Di^4). So setting them equal:

(π/32)*d_solid^4 = (π/32)*(Do^4 - Di^4)

Yes, so the π/32 terms cancel, leaving:

d_solid^4 = Do^4 - Di^4

So, rearranged, Di^4 = Do^4 - d_solid^4.

Wait, that's correct. So I can compute Di as the fourth root of (Do^4 - d_solid^4).

Wait, but let me make sure. The solid shaft's diameter is 3.8 inches. So d_solid = 3.8 in. The hollow shaft's outer diameter Do is 5 inches. So plugging in those numbers:

Di^4 = (5)^4 - (3.8)^4.

Let me compute each term.

5^4 is 5*5=25, 25*5=125, 125*5=625.

3.8^4: Let me compute that step by step. 3.8 squared is 14.44. Then 14.44 squared is... Hmm, 14 *14 is 196, 0.44^2 is about 0.1936, but wait, no, I should compute 14.44 * 14.44.

Alternatively, 14.44 *14.44: Let's compute that:

14.44 *14.44 = (14 + 0.44)^2 = 14^2 + 2*14*0.44 + 0.44^2 = 196 + 12.32 + 0.1936 = 208.5136.

So, 3.8^4 = 208.5136.

So Di^4 = 625 - 208.5136 = 416.4864.

Now, to find Di, take the fourth root of 416.4864.

Hmm, what's the fourth root of 416.4864?

Well, let's think about some numbers. Let's see:

4^4 = 256.

5^4=625.

So 416.4864 is between 4^4 and 5^4, closer to 5^4.

Let me try 4.5^4: 4.5^2=20.25, 20.25^2=410.0625.

Hmm, that's close to 416.4864.

So 4.5^4=410.0625.

Wait, so 4.5^4 is 410.0625, which is less than 416.4864. So Di must be a bit higher than 4.5.

Let me try 4.55^4.

First, 4.55^2: 4.55 *4.55.

4 *4=16, 4*0.55=2.2, 0.55*4=2.2, 0.55*0.55=0.3025.

So 16 + 2.2 + 2.2 +0.3025 = 20.7025.

So 4.55^2=20.7025.

Now, 20.7025 squared is (20.7025)^2.

Let me compute that: 20^2=400, 0.7025^2≈0.4935, and cross terms: 2*20*0.7025=28.1.

So adding up: 400 + 28.1 + 0.4935 ≈428.5935. Wait, that can't be right because 20.7025 squared is about 428.59, but that's higher than 416.4864. So 4.55^4 would be 428.59, which is higher than 416.4864. So Di^4 is 416.4864, so Di must be between 4.5 and 4.55.

Wait, wait, but earlier I got 4.5^4 as 410.0625, which is less than 416.4864. So let's find x where x^4=416.4864. Let's compute 4.5^4=410.0625. The difference is 416.4864 -410.0625=6.4239.

So how much more than 4.5 is needed to get an increase of 6.4239 in x^4.

Let me try 4.52^4.

First, 4.52^2.

4.52*4.52: 4*4=16, 4*.52=2.08, .52*4=2.08, .52*.52≈0.2704.

So adding up: 16 + 2.08 + 2.08 + 0.2704 ≈20.4304.

Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, I think I messed up the calculation. Let me compute 4.52*4.52 properly.

Let me compute it as 4.52 *4.52:

4.52 *4 = 18.08

4.52 *0.5 = 2.26

4.52 *0.02=0.0904

Adding them up: 18.08 +2.26=20.34 +0.0904=20.4304.

So 4.52^2=20.4304.

Now, 20.4304^2: Let's compute that.

20^2=400, 0.4304^2≈0.1853, cross term: 2*20*0.4304=17.216.

So total: 400 +17.216=417.216 +0.1853≈417.4013.

Wait, but 4.52^4 is 20.4304^2 ≈417.4013. But we need 416.4864. So 4.52^4 is about 417.40, which is a bit higher than 416.4864.

So let's try 4.51.

4.51^2: 4.51 *4.51.

Compute as (4 + 0.51)^2 = 4^2 + 2*4*0.51 + 0.51^2 = 16 +4.08 +0.2601=20.3401.

So 4.51^2=20.3401.

Now, 20.3401^2: (20 + 0.3401)^2=20^2 + 2*20*0.3401 +0.3401^2=400 +13.604 +0.1156≈413.7196.

Hmm, that's lower than 416.4864. So 4.51^4≈413.7196, which is less than the target 416.4864.

So between 4.51 and 4.52.

Let me do a linear approximation.

The target is 416.4864.

At 4.51: 413.7196.

At 4.52: 417.4013.

The difference between 4.51 and 4.52 is 0.01 in x, and the J increases by 417.4013 -413.7196=3.6817 over this interval.

We need to find how much x beyond 4.51 gives us an increase of (416.4864 -413.7196)=2.7668.

So the fraction is 2.7668 /3.6817≈0.751.

So x≈4.51 +0.751*(0.01)=4.51+0.00751≈4.5175 inches.

Wait, that seems a bit rough. Alternatively, perhaps there's a better way. Alternatively, maybe using a calculator would be faster, but since this is a thought process, perhaps I can proceed with an approximate value.

But maybe I should check the options. Let's see the options given for the inside diameter (Di):

Options are A:4.4, B:4.5, C:3.9, D:4.7, E:4.0, F:4.2, G:4.1, H:4.25, I:4.6, J:4.33.

Wait, my calculation for Di came out to about 4.5175 inches, which is approximately 4.52 inches. But none of the options exactly match that. The closest options are B:4.5 in (which is 4.50) and J:4.33 in. Hmm, but wait, 4.5175 is closer to 4.52, but the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in my approach.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I should use the formula correctly. Let me check again.

Wait, no, the formula seems correct. J_solid = J_hollow.

So J_solid = (π/32) * d_solid^4.

J_hollow = (π/32) * (Do^4 - Di^4).

Set equal: d_solid^4 = Do^4 - Di^4.

So Di^4 = Do^4 - d_solid^4.

Plugging numbers: Do=5, d_solid=3.8.

So Do^4=625, d_solid^4=3.8^4=208.5136.

So Di^4=625-208.5136=416.4864.

So Di= (416.4864)^(1/4).

Wait, alternatively, perhaps I can compute it using logarithms or exponents.

Let me think: 416.4864 is approximately 4.5175^4, as I found earlier. So Di≈4.5175 inches.

Looking back at the options, the closest one is B:4.5 in. But let me check if 4.5^4 is 410.0625, which is less than 416.4864, so the correct Di is a bit higher than 4.5, like 4.52. But the options don't have that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check the numbers.

Wait, 3.8^4: 3.8 squared is 14.44. 14.44 squared is 208.5136. Correct.

Do^4=5^4=625. Correct.

So Di^4=625-208.5136=416.4864. Correct.

So Di= (416.4864)^(1/4). Let me compute this more accurately.

Let me compute 416.4864^(1/4).

We can take square roots twice. First, sqrt(416.4864) = approx 20.408, because 20^2=400, 20.4^2=416.16, which is close to 416.4864.

So sqrt(416.4864)=20.408.

Now, sqrt(20.408) is approx 4.517, because 4.5^2=20.25, 4.51^2=20.3401, 4.52^2=20.4304. So 4.517^2≈20.408.

So Di≈4.517 inches, which is about 4.52 inches.

Looking at the options, the closest is B:4.5 in, but that would give a Di^4=4.5^4=410.0625, which is less than 416.4864, so the correct Di is a bit higher. Since none of the options match exactly, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the question is about diameter, but I've been using diameters, not radii. Wait, no, the formula for J uses diameter, not radius, so I think that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the area instead of J. Wait, no, because the problem states that the torsional strength is the same, which relates to J.

Wait, maybe I should use the shear modulus and the angle of twist, but I think the approach is correct.

Wait, perhaps the options have a typo, or maybe I'm miscalculating. Alternatively, perhaps the hollow shaft is the one with the same diameter as the solid, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is J = (π/2)*(Do^4 - Di^4)/32. Wait, no, that's correct as I used before: J = (π/32)*(Do^4 - Di^4). So the approach is correct.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check again.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the percentage saving based on weight. The question also asks for the percentage by weight saved. So I need to calculate the weight of the solid shaft and the hollow shaft, then find the percentage saved.

Wait, but first, let's get the correct Di. Since Di is approximately 4.52 inches, but the options don't have that, I might need to recheck.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the area instead of J. No, because J is about torsional strength. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the same maximum shear stress, which would involve the same J, so the approach is correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I'm using diameters instead of radii. Let me check the formula again. No, the formula for J for a solid shaft is (π/32)*d^4, where d is the diameter. So I think that's correct.

Wait, maybe I should compute the volume, which would relate to the weight if the material is the same. So the weight saved would be (Volume_solid - Volume_hollow)/Volume_solid *100%.

So, Volume_solid = π*(d_solid/2)^2 * length. Volume_hollow = π*((Do/2)^2 - (Di/2)^2)*length.

Since the length is the same for both, it cancels out, so the weight saved is based on the cross-sectional area.

So, cross-sectional area of solid: π*(d_solid/2)^2.

Cross-sectional area of hollow: π*( (Do/2)^2 - (Di/2)^2 ).

So, the area saved is (Area_solid - Area_hollow)/Area_solid *100%.

So, let's compute that once I have Di.

But first, I need the correct Di. Wait, let me recheck the calculation for Di.

Wait, perhaps I should compute Di as the cube root instead of the fourth root. No, no, because J is proportional to d^4 for solid shafts.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation. Let me recompute 3.8^4.

3.8^4: 3.8 squared is 14.44. 14.44 squared is 208.5136. Correct.

5^4 is 625. Correct.

So Di^4=625-208.5136=416.4864.

So Di= (416.4864)^(1/4)= approx 4.517 inches.

But the options don't have that. The closest option for Di is B:4.5 in, which is 4.50 inches. Let's see what the percentage saving would be with Di=4.5.

Compute Area_solid = π*(3.8/2)^2 = π*(1.9)^2=π*3.61≈11.34 in².

Area_hollow = π*( (5/2)^2 - (4.5/2)^2 )= π*(6.25 - (2.25)^2)= wait, (4.5/2)=2.25, so (2.25)^2=5.0625. So 6.25-5.0625=1.1875. So Area_hollow= π*1.1875≈3.733 in².

So the area saved is (11.34 -3.733)/11.34 *100≈(7.607)/11.34*100≈67.07%.

Wait, that's a 67% saving, but the options don't have that. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, no, let me recheck:

If Di=4.5 inches, then:

Area_hollow = π*( (5/2)^2 - (4.5/2)^2 ) = π*(2.5^2 - 2.25^2) = π*(6.25 -5.0625)=π*(1.1875)= approx 3.733 in².

Area_solid= π*(1.9)^2=π*3.61≈11.34 in².

So the hollow area is 3.733, saving 11.34-3.733=7.607 in².

Percentage saved: (7.607/11.34)*100≈67.07%. But none of the options have this. The closest option with a percentage is J:57%, which is lower.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the percentage. Wait, perhaps I should compute the percentage as (Volume saved)/Volume_solid *100. But since both are using the same length, it's equivalent to the area.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the percentage based on the weight, which is the same as the volume, assuming same material.

So, the percentage saved is (1 - Area_hollow/Area_solid)*100.

So, Area_hollow=3.733, Area_solid=11.34.

So 3.733/11.34≈0.33, so 33% of the area is used, meaning 67% saved. But again, the options don't have that.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct Di is higher, leading to a lower area, thus higher percentage saved. Wait, let's compute with Di=4.52 inches.

Compute Area_hollow when Di≈4.52:

Area_hollow= π*( (5/2)^2 - (4.52/2)^2 )= π*(6.25 - (2.26)^2).

2.26^2=5.1076.

So 6.25-5.1076=1.1424.

Area_hollow= π*1.1424≈3.586 in².

Area_solid=11.34 in².

So saved area=11.34-3.586≈7.754 in².

Percentage saved=7.754/11.34≈68.38%. Still not matching the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct Di is 4.33 inches, as in option J.

Let me compute Di=4.33.

Di^4=4.33^4.

4.33^2=18.7489.

18.7489^2≈351.53.

But wait, 4.33^4= (4.33^2)^2= (18.7489)^2≈351.53.

But earlier, we have Di^4=416.4864, which is higher than 351.53, so 4.33^4=351.53 <416.4864, so that's not correct. So Di can't be 4.33 inches.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, maybe the question is about the same maximum shear stress, which would mean that the torque is the same. But no, the problem states same torsional strength, which is about J.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula for the angle of twist, but that's also related to J.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of the area instead of J. No, because the question is about torsional strength, which is about J.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the percentage saving based on weight, which would be the same as the area saving.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the percentage saved by weight as ( (Weight_solid - Weight_hollow)/Weight_solid ) *100%.

Since the length is same, it's ( (Area_solid - Area_hollow)/Area_solid ) *100%.

So, with Di≈4.52 inches, the area_hollow≈3.586, area_solid≈11.34, so saving is (11.34-3.586)/11.34≈68.38%, which is not among the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option J:4.33 inches, 57%.

Let me compute Di=4.33 inches.

Compute Di^4=4.33^4.

4.33^2=18.7489.

18.7489^2= approx 351.53.

But earlier, we have Di^4=416.4864, which is higher than 351.53, so Di=4.33 would not satisfy the equation. So that can't be correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup. Let me check again.

Wait, the formula is J_solid = J_hollow.

J_solid = (π/32)*d_solid^4.

J_hollow = (π/32)*(Do^4 - Di^4).

So, setting them equal:

d_solid^4 = Do^4 - Di^4.

So, Di^4 = Do^4 - d_solid^4.

Plugging numbers: Do=5, d_solid=3.8.

So, 5^4=625, 3.8^4=208.5136.

So, Di^4=625 -208.5136=416.4864.

So, Di= (416.4864)^(1/4)= approx 4.517 inches.

So, the correct Di is approximately 4.52 inches, but the options don't have that. The closest option is B:4.5 inches. Let me compute the percentage saved with Di=4.5.

As before, Area_solid=11.34 in².

Area_hollow= π*( (5/2)^2 - (4.5/2)^2 )= π*(6.25 -5.0625)=π*1.1875≈3.733 in².

So, saving= (11.34 -3.733)/11.34≈67.07%.

But looking at the options, the percentages given are 58%,60%,50%,61%,56%,55%,59%,62%,53%,57%.

None of these match 67%. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the same maximum shear stress, which would involve the same torque. But no, the question says same torsional strength, which relates to J.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the same angle of twist, which would involve J as well, but that's the same as J.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is that I'm considering the wrong formula for J. Wait, another formula I've seen is J = (π/2)*(Do^4 - Di^4)/32. So that's the same as (π/32)*(Do^4 - Di^4), which is what I used.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the percentage as (Area_hollow/Area_solid)*100, which would be the material used, and the saving is 100% minus that.

So, with Di=4.5 inches:

Area_hollow=3.733 in².

Area_solid=11.34 in².

So, 3.733/11.34≈33%, so 67% saved. But that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option J:4.33 inches, 57%.

Wait, let me compute Di=4.33 inches.

Compute Di^4=4.33^4= (4.33^2)^2= (18.7489)^2≈351.53.

But we need Di^4=416.4864, which is higher than 351.53, so Di=4.33 is too small.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is option J:4.33 inches, but I must have made a mistake in the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the hollow shaft's inside diameter is such that the cross-sectional area is the same as the solid shaft. But that can't be right because the question is about same torsional strength, which is about J, not area.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the percentage saving based on the weight, which is the same as the area.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option J:4.33 inches, 57%.

Let me compute Di=4.33 inches.

Area_hollow= π*( (5/2)^2 - (4.33/2)^2 )= π*(6.25 - (2.165)^2).

2.165^2= approx 4.691.

So, 6.25 -4.691=1.559.

Area_hollow= π*1.559≈4.905 in².

Area_solid=11.34 in².

So, saving= (11.34 -4.905)/11.34≈66.01/11.34≈58.23%.

Hmm, that's close to option A:58% with Di=4.4 inches. Wait, let me compute Di=4.4 inches.

Di=4.4 inches.

Di^4=4.4^4= (4.4^2)^2=19.36^2=374.8096.

But we need Di^4=416.4864. 374.8096 <416.4864, so Di=4.4 is too small.

Wait, perhaps I should check option J:4.33 inches.

As before, Di=4.33 inches gives Area_hollow≈4.905 in², saving≈58.23%, which is close to 58%, option A.

But wait, option A is 4.4 inches, 58%. So perhaps the correct answer is A:4.4 in,58%.

But earlier calculation with Di=4.5 inches gives 67% saving, which is higher than any option.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Maybe the problem is about the same shear stress, which would involve the same maximum shear stress, which relates to the polar moment of inertia and the torque.

Wait, the shear stress τ_max is given by τ = (T*r)/J, where T is torque, r is radius, and J is polar moment.

If the torque is the same for both shafts, then for the same maximum shear stress, J must be proportional to r. But the problem states same torsional strength, which I think refers to same J, so same T.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I'm using J correctly, but the percentage saving is based on the material used, which is the area.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option J:4.33 inches, 57%.

Let me compute the percentage saving with Di=4.33 inches.

As before, Area_hollow≈4.905 in².

Area_solid=11.34 in².

Saving= (11.34 -4.905)/11.34≈64.35/11.34≈56.76%, which is close to 57%, option J.

So, if Di=4.33 inches, the percentage saved is approximately 57%, which matches option J.

But earlier, I found that Di=4.33 inches would give J_hollow less than J_solid, which can't be right because J_hollow must equal J_solid.

Wait, no, because J depends on the fourth power of the diameters. So, if Di=4.33 inches, then J_hollow would be less than J_solid, which contradicts the problem statement.

So, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach, and the correct answer is option J:4.33 inches, 57%.

But I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to summarize:

- J_solid = J_hollow → d_solid^4 = Do^4 - Di^4 → Di^4=Do^4 - d_solid^4.

- Compute Di^4=625 - 208.5136=416.4864 → Di≈4.517 inches.

- The options don't have 4.517, but option B is 4.5 inches.

- With Di=4.5 inches, percentage saved≈67%, which isn't an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the question intended to use radius instead of diameter in the formula, but that would change everything.

Wait, perhaps I should use radii instead of diameters. Let me try that.

If I use radii, then J_solid = (π/2)* (2r_solid)^4 /32 = (π/2)*(16 r_solid^4)/32 = (π r_solid^4)/4.

Wait, no, that seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is J = (π/2)*(Do^4 - Di^4)/32, which is what I used earlier.

Wait, perhaps I should check the options again.

Looking at option J:4.33 inches, 57%.

If I compute the percentage saving with Di=4.33 inches:

Area_hollow=π*( (5/2)^2 - (4.33/2)^2 )= π*(6.25 - (2.165)^2)= π*(6.25 -4.691)= π*1.559≈4.905 in².

Area_solid=11.34 in².

Saving= (11.34-4.905)/11.34≈64.35/11.34≈56.76%, which is approximately 57%.

So, the percentage saved is about 57%, matching option J.

But earlier, I found that Di=4.33 inches gives J_hollow= (π/32)*(625 -4.33^4)= (π/32)*(625 -351.53)= (π/32)*273.47≈27.347 * π≈85.94 in^4.

But J_solid=(π/32)*3.8^4= (π/32)*208.5136≈6.516 * π≈20.47 in^4.

Wait, that can't be right because J_hollow must equal J_solid. So, clearly, I'm making a mistake here. I think the confusion arises because I'm mixing up diameters and radii.

Wait, perhaps I should recompute J correctly.

Wait, J_solid = (π/32)*d_solid^4.

d_solid=3.8 inches.

So J_solid= (π/32)*(3.8)^4= (π/32)*208.5136≈6.516 * π≈20.47 in^4.

J_hollow= (π/32)*(Do^4 - Di^4).

If Di=4.33 inches:

Do=5 inches, so Do^4=625.

Di^4=4.33^4= approx 351.53.

So J_hollow= (π/32)*(625 -351.53)= (π/32)*273.47≈8.545 * π≈26.83 in^4.

But J_solid is ≈20.47 in^4, so J_hollow is higher, which contradicts the problem statement that they have the same torsional strength. So, this can't be correct.

Therefore, the correct Di must be such that J_hollow= J_solid=20.47 in^4.

So, J_hollow=20.47= (π/32)*(625 - Di^4).

Solving for Di^4:

625 - Di^4= (20.47 *32)/π ≈ (655.04)/3.1416≈208.5136.

So, Di^4=625 -208.5136=416.4864.

Thus, Di≈4.517 inches.

So, the correct Di is approximately 4.52 inches, which isn't an option. The closest is B:4.5 inches.

With Di=4.5 inches, the percentage saved is (11.34 -3.733)/11.34≈67%, which isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the same maximum shear stress, which would involve the same J and same T. But no, the problem states same torsional strength, which is about J.

I think I'm stuck. Based on the calculations, the correct Di is approximately 4.52 inches, but since it's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option J:4.33 inches, 57%, but that doesn't satisfy J equality.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach, and the correct answer is option J:4.33 inches, 57%.

Wait, perhaps the percentage is calculated differently. Maybe it's the percentage of the hollow shaft's weight compared to the solid shaft. So, (Area_hollow / Area_solid)*100= (3.733/11.34)*100≈33%, so the material saved is 67%, but that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the percentage is based on the volume of material removed, which would be the same as the area difference.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the percentage as ( (Do^2 - Di^2) / Do^2 ) *100%, but that's not correct because J depends on the fourth power.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the percentage of material saved as ( (Do^2 - Di^2) / (d_solid^2) ) *100%, but that doesn't make sense.

I'm getting stuck here. Given the options, the only one that somewhat makes sense is option J:4.33 inches, 57%, but my calculations don't support that. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula for shear modulus:

The angle of twist is θ= (T*L)/(J*G), where G is shear modulus.

If the angles are the same for the same torque, then J must be same. So, J_solid= J_hollow.

Thus, the approach is correct.

Given that, and the calculations leading to Di≈4.52 inches, I think the intended answer is option B:4.5 inches, 58%, but that's not matching the percentage.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option J:4.33 inches, 57%, but I can't reconcile that with the calculations.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the percentage saving based on the weight, which would be the same as the area saved.

With Di=4.52 inches:

Area_hollow= π*( (5/2)^2 - (4.52/2)^2 )= π*(6.25 - (2.26)^2)= π*(6.25 -5.1076)= π*1.1424≈3.586 in².

Area_solid=11.34 in².

Saving= (11.34-3.586)/11.34≈7.754/11.34≈68.38%.

But that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option J:4.33 inches, 57%.

But with Di=4.33 inches, J_hollow is higher than J_solid, which can't be.

I think I've spent enough time on this. Based on the calculations, the correct Di is approximately 4.52 inches, which isn't an option, but the closest is B:4.5 inches. However, the percentage saved isn't matching any option. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option J:4.33 inches, 57%, but I'm not sure.

The problem involves calculating the inside diameter of a hollow shaft with an outer diameter (OD) of 5 inches, designed to have the same torsional strength as a solid shaft with a diameter of 3.8 inches. Additionally, the percentage of material saved by weight needs to be determined.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Torsional Strength and Polar Moment of Inertia (J):**
   - The torsional strength is directly related to the polar moment of inertia \( J \), which for a solid shaft is given by:
     \[
     J_{\text{solid}} = \frac{\pi}{32} d_{\text{solid}}^4
     \]
     where \( d_{\text{solid}} = 3.8 \, \text{in} \).
   - For a hollow shaft, the polar moment of inertia is:
     \[
     J_{\text{hollow}} = \frac{\pi}{32} \left( D_{\text{o}}^4 - D_{\text{i}}^4 \right)
     \]
     where \( D_{\text{o}} = 5 \, \text{in} \) and \( D_{\text{i}} \) is the inside diameter to be determined.

2. **Equating Torsional Strength:**
   Since the torsional strengths are equal:
   \[
   J_{\text{solid}} = J_{\text{hollow}}
   \]
   Substituting the expressions for \( J \):
   \[
   \frac{\pi}{32} d_{\text{solid}}^4 = \frac{\pi}{32} \left( D_{\text{o}}^4 - D_{\text{i}}^4 \right)
   \]
   Simplifying:
   \[
   d_{\text{solid}}^4 = D_{\text{o}}^4 - D_{\text{i}}^4
   \]
   Rearranging:
   \[
   D_{\text{i}}^4 = D_{\text{o}}^4 - d_{\text{solid}}^4
   \]

3. **Calculating \( D_{\text{i}} \):**
   - \( D_{\text{o}}^4 = 5^4 = 625 \)
   - \( d_{\text{solid}}^4 = 3.8^4 = 208.5136 \)
   - Substituting:
     \[
     D_{\text{i}}^4 = 625 - 208.5136 = 416.4864
     \]
   - Taking the fourth root:
     \[
     D_{\text{i}} = \sqrt[4]{416.4864} \approx 4.52 \, \text{in}
     \]

4. **Material Saved (Weight):**
   The weight saved is proportional to the cross-sectional area difference:
   \[
   \text{Weight Saved} = \left( 1 - \frac{\text{Area}_{\text{hollow}}}{\text{Area}_{\text{solid}}} \right) \times 100\%
   \]
   - Cross-sectional area of the solid shaft:
     \[
     \text{Area}_{\text{solid}} = \pi \left( \frac{d_{\text{solid}}}{2} \right)^2 = \pi (1.9)^2 \approx 11.34 \, \text{in}^2
     \]
   - Cross-sectional area of the hollow shaft:
     \[
     \text{Area}_{\text{hollow}} = \pi \left( \left( \frac{D_{\text{o}}}{2} \right)^2 - \left( \frac{D_{\text{i}}}{2} \right)^2 \right)
     \]
     Substituting \( D_{\text{i}} \approx 4.52 \, \text{in} \):
     \[
     \text{Area}_{\text{hollow}} = \pi \left( 6.25 - 5.0625 \right) = \pi (1.1875) \approx 3.733 \, \text{in}^2
     \]
   - Percentage saved:
     \[
     \text{Weight Saved} = \left( \frac{11.34 - 3.733}{11.34} \right) \times 100\% \approx 67.07\%
     \]

5. **Matching with Options:**
   - The calculated \( D_{\text{i}} \approx 4.52 \, \text{in} \) does not match any option exactly.
   - The closest option for \( D_{\text{i}} \) is **B: 4.5 in**.
   - However, the percentage saved (67.07%) does not match any option, suggesting either an error in the problem setup or a mismatch in the provided options.

### Conclusion:
Based on the calculations, the inside diameter of the hollow shaft is approximately **4.52 inches**, and the percentage of material saved is approximately **67.07%**. However, since the closest option for \( D_{\text{i}} \) is **4.5 in (Option B)**, and no option matches the percentage saved, the most reasonable choice is:

**Answer: B**
