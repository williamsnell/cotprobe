The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

Describe the development of seed.

Options:

A: The seed evolves from the transformation of the flower's nectar, which solidifies and encases the embryo
B: The seed is formed from the stamens
C: The seed is a combination of multiple petals that harden over time after the flower has been pollinated
D: The seed develops from the petals and sepals
E: The ovule with its contained embryo and endosperm becomes the seed; its wall, or integument, thickens to form the tough outer covering of the seed.
F: Seeds are formed directly from the pollen grains that land on the stigma of the flower
G: The seed develops from the accumulation of nutrients in the pistil without fertilization
H: The seed is a result of the withering and falling off of the stigma and style after fertilization
I: The seed is produced from the calyx, which encloses the rest of the flower and eventually forms the seed coat
J: The seed originates from the fusion of two ovules within the flower after pollination

Answer:

Okay, I need to figure out which option correctly describes the development of a seed. Let me start by recalling what I know about plant reproduction.

So, seeds develop from the ovules in a flower after pollination. The process starts when pollen lands on the stigma of a flower. The pollen then germinates, and the sperm travels down the style to reach the ovary, where the ovules are located. Each ovule has an embryo sac with an egg cell. When the sperm fertilizes the egg, it forms a zygote, which will develop into the embryo of the seed.

The ovule itself, after fertilization, becomes the seed. The integument of the ovule thickens to form the seed coat. So the seed is essentially the mature ovule that has developed after fertilization. Let me look at the options now.

Option A says the seed comes from nectar solidifying. That doesn't sound right because nectar is related to attracting pollinators, not seed formation.

Option B claims the seed is formed from the stamens. But stamens produce pollen, not the seed itself. The seed comes from the ovules, which are in the ovary, not the stamens.

Option C suggests multiple petals hardening. Petals are part of the flower's structure but don't directly form the seed. The seed comes from the ovule.

Option D says petals and sepals form the seed. Again, petals and sepals are parts of the flower but not the origin of the seed.

Option E states the seed is the ovule with embryo and endosperm, and its integument becomes the tough outer layer. This aligns with what I remember about seed development. The ovule becomes the seed, and the integument forms the seed coat.

Option F says seeds form from pollen grains landing on the stigma. Pollen is necessary for fertilization, but the seed comes from the ovule, not the pollen itself.

Option G suggests seeds form from nutrients in the pistil without fertilization. That's not correct because seeds require fertilization. Also, the pistil includes the stigma, style, and ovary, but the seed comes from the ovule within the ovary.

Option H says the seed is from the stigma and style withering. The stigma and style are parts of the flower's structure, but the seed comes from the ovule, not these parts.

Option I claims the seed comes from the calyx. The calyx is the outer part of the flower (sepals), so that's not where seeds develop.

Option J says seeds come from two ovules fusing. I don't think so; each seed comes from a single ovule.

So, the correct answer should be E. It correctly describes the seed as the mature ovule with its embryo and endosperm, and the integument forming the seed coat.

The correct answer is E because the seed develops from the ovule, which becomes the seed after fertilization, with its integument forming the seed coat.
