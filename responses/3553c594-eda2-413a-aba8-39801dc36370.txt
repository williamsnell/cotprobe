The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

Police received information from a reliable informant that a defendant would be extorting money from a victim. The informant gave the police explicit details about the extortion scheme: the defendant would be calling the victim from a public phone booth on a particular street corner on a certain date and time to make the extortionist demand. Without notif'ing the telephone company or seeking a warrant, the police installed an eavesdropping device on the public phone. At the time on the date specified by the informant, the defendant phoned the victim from the telephone booth and said, "You better pay me $5,000 by next week or I'll kill you and your family. " The defendant provided additional details about how and where to make the payoff. Based on the taped conversation, the police arrested the defendant and charged him with extortion. Prior to trial, the defendant's attorney moves to exclude the taped conversation from evidence. The defense motion should be

Options:

A: granted, because the police should have obtained a court order before recording the conversation.
B: denied, because the police had probable cause based on the information supplied by the informant.
C: denied, because the defendant did not have reasonable expectation of privacy.
D: granted, because the police violated the defendant's rights by not informing him of the eavesdropping device.
E: denied, because the information from the informant was reliable and specific.
F: granted, because the police did not obtain prior approval of the telephone company before installing the eavesdropping device.
G: denied, because the threat made by the defendant was a serious crime.
H: granted, because the police did not secure a warrant before installing the eavesdropping device.
I: granted, because the defendant was not aware of the eavesdropping device.
J: denied, because the phone booth is a public place with no expectation of privacy.

Alright, so I have this question about criminal procedure and the Fourth Amendment, I think. Let me try to break it down. Okay, the scenario is that the police got information from a reliable informant about someone extorting money. The informant gave them details about when and where the defendant would make the call. Without notifying the phone company or getting a warrant, the police installed an eavesdropping device on the public phone. Then, the defendant called from that booth and made some threats. The police taped the conversation and arrested him. Now, the defendant's attorney is moving to exclude the taped conversation. The question is, should the motion be granted or denied?

Hmm, I remember that the Fourth Amendment protects against unreasonable searches and seizures. Eavesdropping would fall under a search if it's wiretapping or intercepting communications. But there are exceptions where a warrant isn't required.

So, the key here is whether the police needed a warrant to install the eavesdropping device. The options mention things like probable cause, expectation of privacy, and whether a warrant was obtained.

I think about the case of Katz v. United States. There, the Supreme Court held that the government's use of a listening device to record a conversation without a warrant violated the Fourth Amendment because there was a reasonable expectation of privacy in a telephone booth. But wait, in this case, the police didn't get a warrant but they had a reliable informant's tip. Does that make a difference?

Wait, another thought: the police didn't use the informant's information to get a warrant but instead used it to install the device. So, if the tip was reliable, maybe they didn't need a warrant because they had probable cause? Or does the Fourth Amendment still require a warrant for such surveillance?

I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. Without a warrant, the installation of the eavesdropping device might be illegal unless there's an exception. But the defendant's attorney is arguing that the evidence should be excluded because the police didn't get a warrant. So, the issue is whether the warrantless installation was permissible.

But wait, the question also mentions that the police didn't notify the telephone company. Does that matter? I think some states require the phone company's consent or notification, but under federal law, I don't think so. The Fourth Amendment is about government conduct, not private companies. So, maybe that's not the main issue here.

Looking at the options, option A says the motion should be granted because the police should have obtained a court order. But if they had probable cause, maybe they didn't need a warrant. Option B says denied because the police had probable cause from the informant. Option C is about expectation of privacy, which I think was the issue in Katz. But in Katz, the Court said there was an expectation of privacy in a phone booth, so the warrantless recording was a violation. However, if the police had a warrant, it would be okay.

Wait, but in this case, the police didn't get a warrant. So, under Katz, they violated the Fourth Amendment. Therefore, the evidence should be excluded. So, the motion should be granted. But wait, what if the informant's information provided probable cause, making the warrant unnecessary? No, I think even with probable cause, you usually need a warrant for wiretapping.

Alternatively, there's the exception for consent. If the phone company consented, then the police could install the device. But in this case, they didn't notify the phone company. So, maybe the phone company didn't consent. Therefore, the police would need a warrant. So, the installation without a warrant was illegal, making the evidence inadmissible.

So, looking at the options, option A says granted because they should have gotten a court order. Option H says granted because they didn't get a warrant. So, which is correct?

Wait, the issue is whether a warrant was required. If the police had probable cause, they should have gotten a warrant. Since they didn't, the evidence is tainted. So, the motion should be granted because they didn't get a warrant (option H). But option A is similar but phrased differently.

Wait, another angle: the police had a reliable informant's information. If the informant's tip provided probable cause, does that mean they didn't need a warrant? Or is a warrant still required for wiretapping?

I think wiretapping generally requires a warrant even if there's probable cause. So, the fact that they had probable cause doesn't mean they didn't need a warrant. So, the lack of a warrant would make the evidence inadmissible. Therefore, the motion should be granted because they didn't get a warrant (option H). But wait, some cases might say that if the police have probable cause, they don't need a warrant if it's under certain conditions, but I think for wiretapping, a warrant is usually required.

Alternatively, the phone booth is a public place. So, does that affect the expectation of privacy? In some cases, a public place might not have an expectation of privacy, but a phone booth is considered a place where people expect some privacy. In Katz, the Court said yes. So, the fact that it's a public phone booth doesn't negate the expectation of privacy.

So, putting it together: the police didn't get a warrant, which was required, so the evidence should be excluded. Therefore, the motion should be granted because they didn't get a warrant (option H). But wait, the options also have J, which says denied because it's a public place with no expectation of privacy. But from Katz, the expectation exists, so J would be incorrect.

Wait, maybe the key is that the police didn't need a warrant because the informant's information provided probable cause, and they didn't need a warrant for that. Or perhaps the police didn't need a warrant because they didn't intercept the communication but just used the device based on probable cause.

I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me try to recall: for wiretapping, a warrant is generally required unless there's an exception, like consent or a danger of destruction of evidence. But in this case, there's no indication of such exceptions. So, the lack of a warrant would make the evidence inadmissible.

Therefore, the correct answer would be that the motion should be granted because the police didn't obtain a warrant (option H). But wait, option A says granted because they should have obtained a court order, which is similar. So, which is the correct way to phrase it?

Hmm. The Fourth Amendment requires a warrant for wiretapping unless an exception applies. Since they didn't get a warrant, the evidence is inadmissible. So, the motion should be granted, so options A and H are possibilities.

Option A says granted because they should have obtained a court order. H says granted because they didn't secure a warrant. Both reasons seem correct, but perhaps H is more precise. Alternatively, the correct reason is the lack of a warrant, so H is correct.

Wait, but in some jurisdictions, police can use a pen register without a warrant if they have probable cause, but that's different. For wiretapping, a warrant is usually required.

So, the police didn't get a warrant, so the evidence is excluded. Therefore, the motion should be granted because they didn't get a warrant (option H). Alternatively, if the court finds that the information from the informant was reliable and specific, then maybe the warrant wasn't necessary because they had probable cause. But I think even with probable cause, a warrant is needed for wiretapping.

So, I think the correct answer is H: granted because the police didn't get a warrant.

The question revolves around whether the defendant's motion to exclude the taped conversation should be granted. The Fourth Amendment protects against unreasonable searches and seizures, and wiretapping typically requires a warrant unless an exception applies. In this case, the police installed an eavesdropping device without a warrant, relying instead on information from a reliable informant. 

The key issue is whether a warrant was required. Under the precedent set by *Katz v. United States*, there is a reasonable expectation of privacy in a telephone booth, making the warrantless recording a violation of the Fourth Amendment. While the informant's information provided probable cause, wiretapping generally requires a warrant even with probable cause. Since the police did not obtain a warrant, the evidence should be excluded. 

Option H correctly identifies that the police violated the defendant's rights by not securing a warrant, making the evidence inadmissible. 

Answer: H
