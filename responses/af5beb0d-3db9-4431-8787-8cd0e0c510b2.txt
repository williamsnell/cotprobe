Answer the following multiple choice question, selecting from the answer A through to J. After thinking, reply directly with your answer. 

The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

After waiting in line for two hours to gain entry into a popular nightclub, a man was denied admission because his attire failed to conform to the club's dress code. When he was refused admittance, the man angrily shouted to the club's doorman, "You'll be sorry for this. After I'm through, this club will be reduced to rubble. " Later that same evening, the man returned to the club with two explosives in his possession. He noticed the defendant leaving the club and followed him into a nearby parking lot. As the defendant was about to enter his car, the man grabbed him, pointed a gun and said, "Follow me, you punk, or I'll blow your brains out. " The man led the defendant to the rear of the club, handed him the explosives, and directed him to throw them through an open window of the club. In fear of his life, the defendant tossed the explosives into the club, causing an inferno that killed 25 people. In this jurisdiction, the applicable arson statute includes all buildings. If the defendant is charged with felony murder for the death of the people in the club, he will most likely be found

Options:

A: not guilty, because he was coerced into committing the act.
B: guilty, because he did not attempt to alert authorities before throwing the explosives.
C: not guilty, because he was acting under immediate threat to his life.
D: guilty, because they were killings that occurred during the commission of an inherently dangerous felony.
E: not guilty, because the defendant was justified under the circumstances.
F: not guilty, because duress is a defense to arson.
G: guilty, as the crime was premeditated and caused multiple deaths.
H: guilty, because he physically committed the act of throwing the explosives.
I: not guilty, because he was not the primary actor in the crime.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this legal question about felony murder. Let me go through the scenario step by step.

So, the situation is that a man waited in line for two hours to get into a nightclub but was denied because his clothes didn't meet the dress code. He got angry and told the doorman he'd be sorry and the club would be destroyed. Later that evening, he comes back with two explosives. He sees the defendant (I think that's the doorman?) leaving the club and follows him into a parking lot. Then he grabs the defendant, points a gun, and says, "Follow me, you punk, or I'll blow your brains out." The man then makes the defendant go to the rear of the club, hand over the explosives, and throw them into the club through an open window. Because of this, an inferno starts, killing 25 people.

The question is whether the defendant can be charged with felony murder for those deaths. The options are from A to I, and I need to pick the correct one.

First, I need to understand what felony murder is. From what I remember, felony murder occurs when someone dies during the commission of a felony. The idea is that if you commit a felony and someone dies in the process, you can be held liable for murder, even if you didn't intend to kill them.

In this case, the defendant was forced by the man with the gun to throw the explosives into the club. The explosion caused the deaths. So, the key here is whether the defendant's actions meet the criteria for felony murder.

I think the main issue is whether the defendant acted under duress. If he was coerced, maybe he has a defense. But I also remember that duress isn't always a complete defense, especially if the felony is something inherently dangerous like arson or explosives.

Looking at the options:

A: Not guilty because coerced. But I think duress can sometimes be a defense, but it depends on the jurisdiction and the specific felony.

B: Guilty because he didn't alert authorities. I'm not sure about this. The felony murder rule usually doesn't require intent, just that the death occurred during the felony. So maybe this isn't the main issue.

C: Not guilty because acting under immediate threat. This seems similar to duress. Immediate threat could be a defense, but again, I think it depends on the felony's nature.

D: Guilty because it's during an inherently dangerous felony. Arson is an example of an inherently dangerous felony. So if the defendant was part of that felony, maybe he's guilty.

E: Not guilty because justified. Justification usually requires self-defense, which I don't think applies here because the defendant was forced to commit the act against others.

F: Not guilty because duress is a defense to arson. I'm not sure if duress applies here. Some jurisdictions might accept it, but others might not, especially if the felony is considered particularly dangerous.

G: Guilty because premeditated and caused multiple deaths. But was the defendant premeditating? He was forced to do it under threat, so maybe it's not premeditated.

H: Guilty because he threw the explosives. That's the act, but felony murder isn't about intent but about the felony committed. So he's guilty because he was part of the felony.

I: Not guilty because he wasn't the primary actor. I don't think that matters; being an accomplice can still make you guilty.

So, the key points are:

1. The defendant was coerced into committing the act.
2. The felony here is arson (since the statute includes all buildings), which is an inherently dangerous felony.

In felony murder, if the death occurs during the commission of a felony, the person can be charged. The coercion might be a defense, but I think in many jurisdictions, if the felony is inherently dangerous, duress isn't a defense. So the defendant could still be guilty because he was part of the felony, even if coerced.

Looking at the options, option D says guilty because the killings occurred during the commission of an inherently dangerous felony. That seems to fit.

Option A says not guilty because of coercion, but I think that's not the case here because the felony is dangerous, so duress might not be a valid defense.

So, I think the correct answer is D.

The defendant was coerced into committing the act but was still part of an inherently dangerous felony (arson), making him guilty under the felony murder rule. 

Answer: D
