Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about light reflecting off a glass surface. Hmm, I remember that when light hits a boundary between two media, some of it reflects and some transmits. The question is asking two parts: a) the fraction reflected and b) the ratio of E components in the plane and perpendicular to it.

First, part a. The light is natural, so it's unpolarized. The glass has an index of 1.523, and the angle of incidence is 70 degrees. I think I need to use the Fresnel equations for the reflection coefficient. Wait, but since it's unpolarized, the reflection fraction would be the average of the s and p polarizations.

The formula for the reflection coefficient for s-polarization (perpendicular) is (n2*cosθi - n1*cosθt)/(n2*cosθi + n1*cosθt), but wait, actually, the Fresnel equations are a bit more involved. Alternatively, I remember there's a formula for the reflectance, which is the fraction reflected. For unpolarized light, the reflectance R is (R_s + R_p)/2, where R_s and R_p are the reflectances for s and p polarizations, respectively.

Wait, but when the light is going from air to glass, n1 is air (1.0) and n2 is glass (1.523). So first, I need to find the angle of refraction, θt, using Snell's law: n1*sinθi = n2*sinθt. So sinθt = (n1/n2) sinθi.

Let me compute that. θi is 70 degrees. So sin(70) is approximately 0.9397. Multiply by n1/n2 which is 1/1.523. Let's calculate 0.9397 / 1.523. Hmm, 0.9397 /1.5 is about 0.6265, but 1.523 is a bit higher, so maybe around 0.616. So sinθt ≈ 0.616. Then θt is the arcsin of that. Let me think, sin 38 degrees is about 0.6157. So θt is approximately 38 degrees.

Now, using this, I can find cosθi and cosθt. cos(70) is about 0.3420, and cos(38) is about 0.7880.

Now for the reflection coefficients. R_s is [(n2 cosθi - n1 cosθt)/(n2 cosθi + n1 cosθt)]². Plugging in numbers: numerator is 1.523 * 0.3420 (n2 cosθi) minus 1 * 0.7880 (n1 cosθt). Let me calculate each part.

1.523 * 0.3420 ≈ 0.5207. Then subtract 0.7880: 0.5207 - 0.7880 = -0.2673.

Denominator is 1.523 * 0.3420 + 1 * 0.7880 ≈ 0.5207 + 0.7880 = 1.3087.

So R_s is (-0.2673 / 1.3087)^2. Let's compute that: -0.2673 / 1.3087 ≈ -0.2043. Squared is 0.0417. So R_s ≈ 4.17%.

R_p is given by another formula: [(n2 cosθt - n1 cosθi)/(n2 cosθt + n1 cosθi)]². Wait, wait, no, I think I might have mixed up s and p. Let me double-check. For p-polarization, the reflection is [(n2 cosθi + n1 cosθt)/(n2 cosθi - n1 cosθt)]² if n2 > n1 at the incidence? Wait no, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Wait, the Fresnel equations for s and p are different. For s-polarization, the reflection coefficient is (n2 cosθi - n1 cosθt)/(n2 cosθi + n1 cosθt). For p-polarization, it's (n2 cosθt + n1 cosθi)/(n2 cosθt - n1 cosθi). Wait, no, I think I might have that reversed. Let me think: when moving from medium 1 to medium 2, for p-polarization, the reflection coefficient is (n2 cosθt + n1 cosθi)/(n2 cosθt - n1 cosθi) when n2 > n1. Or maybe it's (n1 cosθi + n2 cosθt)/(n1 cosθi - n2 cosθt) for p? Hmm, perhaps I should just look up the correct formulas. Alternatively, I can use the approximation that when moving from a lower index to higher index, the reflectance for p might be higher.

Wait, maybe I should use the exact Fresnel equations. Let me get this right. The correct formula for the reflection coefficient for s (perpendicular) polarization is (n2 cosθi - n1 cosθt)/(n2 cosθi + n1 cosθt). For p (parallel) polarization, it's (n2 cosθt + n1 cosθi)/(n2 cosθt - n1 cosθi). Wait, no, I think that's not correct. Let me double-check.

Wait, the Fresnel reflection coefficients are:

For s-polarization (electric field perpendicular to plane of incidence):

r_s = (n2 cosθi - n1 cosθt) / (n2 cosθi + n1 cosθt)

For p-polarization (electric field in the plane of incidence):

r_p = (n2 cosθt + n1 cosθi) / (n2 cosθt - n1 cosθi)

But wait, I think the signs can be tricky. Since n2 > n1 here, and the angle is 70 degrees, let me compute each.

So, for r_s, we have numerator: 1.523 * cos(70) - 1 * cos(38). That's 1.523 * 0.3420 ≈ 0.5207, minus 0.7880, which gives 0.5207 - 0.7880 = -0.2673.

Denominator: 0.5207 + 0.7880 = 1.3087.

So r_s = -0.2673 / 1.3087 ≈ -0.2043. So |r_s|² is (0.2043)^2 ≈ 0.0417, so R_s ≈ 4.17%.

For r_p, numerator is 1.523 * cos(38) + 1 * cos(70) → 1.523 * 0.7880 ≈ 1.201, plus 0.3420, so 1.201 + 0.3420 = 1.543.

Denominator is 1.523 * 0.7880 - 1 * 0.3420 → 1.201 - 0.3420 = 0.859.

So r_p = 1.543 / 0.859 ≈ 1.796. But wait, that's a problem because if the denominator is smaller than the numerator, the reflection coefficient can be greater than 1, which would imply more energy than incident, which isn't possible. But perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps I swapped the signs. Let me think again. The correct formula for p-polarization when going from medium 1 to 2 is:

r_p = (n2 cosθt + n1 cosθi) / (n2 cosθt - n1 cosθi) ?

Wait, but in some references, the formula is written as r_p = (n2 cosθt + n1 cosθi) / (n2 cosθt - n1 cosθi). But if n2 cosθt < n1 cosθi, the denominator becomes negative, but the numerator would be positive. So maybe I should take absolute values when calculating reflectance. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the magnitude squared regardless of the sign.

Wait, but in our case, let's compute the numerator and denominator again. Using n2=1.523, n1=1.0.

n2 cosθt = 1.523 * 0.7880 ≈ 1.201.

n1 cosθi = 1.0 * 0.3420 = 0.3420.

So numerator: 1.201 + 0.3420 = 1.543.

Denominator: 1.201 - 0.3420 = 0.859.

So r_p = 1.543 / 0.859 ≈ 1.796.

Wait, that's greater than 1, which isn't possible because the reflection coefficient can't have a magnitude greater than 1. So I must have messed up the formula. Maybe I should have (n1 cosθi + n2 cosθt)/(n1 cosθi - n2 cosθt) instead? Let me check that.

If I switch n1 and n2 in the denominator, then denominator becomes 0.3420 - 1.201 = -0.859.

So r_p = (1.543) / (-0.859) ≈ -1.796. The magnitude is 1.796, but again, that's greater than 1, which is impossible. So I must have the formula wrong.

Wait, perhaps the formula for r_p is (n2 cosθi + n1 cosθt) / (n2 cosθi - n1 cosθt) ?

Wait, no, because the problem is that when n2 > n1, the denominator could become negative, leading to a negative reflection coefficient. But the magnitude squared is what matters for reflectance.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula as r_p = [ (n2 cosθt ) + (n1 cosθi) ] / [ (n2 cosθt ) - (n1 cosθi) ].

But as I calculated, that gives a numerator of 1.543 and denominator 0.859, so r_p≈1.796, which is greater than 1. That can't be right. Reflectance can't be more than 100%, so maybe I made a mistake in the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use r_p = (n1 cosθi + n2 cosθt)/(n1 cosθi - n2 cosθt).

Let me compute that. Then numerator is 0.3420 + 1.201 = 1.543. Denominator is 0.3420 - 1.201 = -0.859. So r_p = 1.543 / (-0.859) ≈ -1.796. The magnitude is 1.796, but again, that's impossible because the reflection coefficient can't be greater than 1. So I must have the formula wrong.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is (n1 cosθi + n2 cosθt)/(n1 cosθi - n2 cosθt) when going from medium 1 to medium 2 for p-polarization. Let me check with a reference. Oh wait, perhaps I'm confusing the formulas. Another approach: when light is moving from a medium with lower refractive index to higher, the reflection for p-polarization can have a negative reflection coefficient, leading to a Brewster angle where reflection is zero. But the magnitude squared is what we need for reflectance.

Wait, but in any case, I'm getting r_p ≈ 1.796, which would imply |r_p|^2 ≈ 3.227, which is impossible because reflectance can't be more than 100%. So I must have made an error.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate it as (n1 cosθi + n2 cosθt) divided by (n1 cosθi - n2 cosθt). So let's try that.

n1 cosθi = 0.3420.

n2 cosθt = 1.201.

So numerator: 0.3420 + 1.201 = 1.543.

Denominator: 0.3420 - 1.201 = -0.859.

So r_p = 1.543 / (-0.859) ≈ -1.796. So |r_p| is 1.796, which squared is 3.227, which is greater than 1, which is impossible. So I'm definitely doing something wrong here.

Wait, perhaps I should use a different approach. Another formula for reflectance R is:

R = ( (n2 cosθi - n1 cosθt) / (n2 cosθi + n1 cosθt) )^2 for s-polarization.

And for p-polarization, R_p = ( (n1 cosθi - n2 cosθt) / (n1 cosθi + n2 cosθt) )^2. Wait, perhaps I should switch the terms. Let me compute that.

So for R_p, it would be ( (n1 cosθi - n2 cosθt) / (n1 cosθi + n2 cosθt) )^2.

Plugging in the numbers: (0.3420 - 1.201)/(0.3420 + 1.201) = (-0.859)/(1.543) ≈ -0.556. Squared is 0.309. So R_p ≈ 30.9%.

Wait, that makes more sense because now the reflectance is less than 100%. So R_s was 4.17% and R_p is 30.9%. So the average reflectance R = (4.17% + 30.9%)/2 ≈ 17.535%. So approximately 17.5%.

Wait, looking at the options, option E is 17.5%, 2.73. But let me check part b) as well because maybe that will help confirm.

Part b) is the ratio of the E-component in the plane of incidence (which would be p-polarization) to the component perpendicular (s-polarization) in the reflected beam. Since the incident light is unpolarized, the reflected light will have a polarization ratio given by (R_p)/(R_s). So the ratio would be R_p / R_s = 30.9% / 4.17% ≈ 7.42. But none of the options have that. Hmm, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in part a.

Wait, wait, I think I messed up the formula for R_p. Because when the light is moving from a lower index to higher index, and for p-polarization, the reflection coefficient can be negative, but the magnitude squared is what matters. Alternatively, maybe I should use the correct formula from a standard source.

Let me think again. The correct Fresnel reflection coefficients are:

For s-polarization (TE waves), r_s = (n2 cosθi - n1 cosθt) / (n2 cosθi + n1 cosθt).

For p-polarization (TM waves), r_p = (n2 cosθt + n1 cosθi) / (n2 cosθt - n1 cosθi).

Wait, but when n2 cosθt > n1 cosθi, the denominator becomes positive, so r_p is positive. Let me compute that again.

n2 cosθt = 1.523 * 0.7880 ≈ 1.201.

n1 cosθi = 1.0 * 0.3420 = 0.3420.

So r_p = (1.201 + 0.3420) / (1.201 - 0.3420) = (1.543) / (0.859) ≈ 1.796. So |r_p| = 1.796, which squared is 3.227, which is 322.7%, which can't be right because reflectance can't exceed 100%. That suggests I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, I think I must have the formula wrong. Let me look it up in my notes. Oh wait, I'm just thinking, perhaps the correct formula for r_p is (n1 cosθi + n2 cosθt) / (n1 cosθi - n2 cosθt). Let's compute that.

n1 cosθi = 0.3420, n2 cosθt = 1.201.

So numerator: 0.3420 + 1.201 = 1.543.

Denominator: 0.3420 - 1.201 = -0.859.

So r_p = 1.543 / (-0.859) ≈ -1.796. The magnitude is 1.796, which squared is 3.227, which is 322.7%, which is impossible. So I must have the formula wrong.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula for r_p is (n2 cosθt + n1 cosθi) / (n2 cosθt - n1 cosθi). But that's what I did earlier, leading to r_p ≈1.796, which is impossible.

Wait, maybe I should have it as (n1 cosθi + n2 cosθt) divided by (n1 cosθi - n2 cosθt) when n2 > n1.

So, let's compute that: (0.3420 + 1.201) / (0.3420 - 1.201) = 1.543 / (-0.859) ≈ -1.796. So |r_p| is 1.796. But that's still impossible because reflectance can't be more than 100%.

Wait, perhaps I'm using the wrong formula. Another approach: perhaps when light goes from a lower index to higher index, the reflection for p-polarization can be calculated using the formula r_p = [ (n2 cosθt) + (n1 cosθi) ] / [ (n2 cosθt) - (n1 cosθi) ].

Wait, but that's what I did earlier, leading to r_p ≈1.796. Which is impossible. So perhaps I'm missing a negative sign somewhere.

Wait, maybe the formula is actually r_p = (n1 cosθi + n2 cosθt)/(n1 cosθi - n2 cosθt). But that gives the same as before, which can't be right.

Alternatively, maybe I should take the reciprocal. Let me think about it differently. Another formula for r_p is (n2 cosθi + n1 cosθt)/(n2 cosθi - n1 cosθt). Let me compute that.

n2 cosθi = 1.523 * 0.3420 ≈ 0.5207.

n1 cosθt = 1.0 * 0.7880 ≈ 0.7880.

So numerator: 0.5207 + 0.7880 ≈ 1.3087.

Denominator: 0.5207 - 0.7880 ≈ -0.2673.

So r_p = 1.3087 / (-0.2673) ≈ -4.901. That's even worse, leading to |r_p|² ≈ 24.02, which is impossible.

I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should try a different approach. Perhaps I can use the approximate formula for reflectance when n2 > n1.

Wait, I remember that the reflectance R can also be calculated using the formula:

R = [ (n2 cosθi - n1 cosθt)/(n2 cosθi + n1 cosθt) ]^2 for s-polarization.

And for p-polarization, it's [ (n1 cosθi - n2 cosθt)/(n1 cosθi + n2 cosθt) ]^2.

Wait, let's try that. So for R_p, it's (0.3420 - 1.201)/(0.3420 + 1.201) → (-0.859)/(1.543) ≈ -0.556. Squared is 0.309, so R_p ≈ 30.9%.

Then, the average reflectance R = (4.17% + 30.9%)/2 ≈ 17.535%, which is about 17.5%. So part a) is approximately 17.5%, which matches option E (17.5%, 2.73) and option H (20.2%, 2.5), etc.

Now part b) is the ratio of the E components in the plane (p) to perpendicular (s) in the reflected beam. Since the incident light is unpolarized, the reflected light has R_p and R_s as the reflectances, so the ratio would be sqrt(R_p/R_s) because the E fields are proportional to the square roots of the reflectances.

Wait, no. The ratio of the E components would be sqrt(R_p)/sqrt(R_s) = sqrt(R_p/R_s).

So R_p is 30.9%, R_s is 4.17%. So R_p/R_s ≈ 7.41. The square root of that is about 2.72.

So the ratio is approximately 2.72, which is close to option E's second value, 2.73.

So the correct answer for a) is 17.5%, and for b) 2.73. That's option E.
</think>

To solve the problem, we analyze the reflection of natural light (unpolarized) at the air-glass interface using the Fresnel equations. The refractive index of air is \( n_1 = 1.0 \), and the glass has \( n_2 = 1.523 \). The angle of incidence is \( \theta_i = 70^\circ \).

### Part (a): Fraction of Incident Light Reflected
1. **Snell's Law**: Calculate the angle of refraction \( \theta_t \) using \( n_1 \sin \theta_i = n_2 \sin \theta_t \).  
   \[
   \sin \theta_t = \frac{n_1}{n_2} \sin \theta_i = \frac{1.0}{1.523} \sin 70^\circ \approx 0.616
   \]
   \[
   \theta_t \approx \arcsin(0.616) \approx 38^\circ
   \]

2. **Reflectance for s- and p-Polarization**:  
   - For s-polarization (\( R_s \)):
     \[
     R_s = \left( \frac{n_2 \cos \theta_i - n_1 \cos \theta_t}{n_2 \cos \theta_i + n_1 \cos \theta_t} \right)^2
     \]
     Substituting values:
     \[
     \cos \theta_i \approx 0.3420, \quad \cos \theta_t \approx 0.7880
     \]
     \[
     R_s = \left( \frac{1.523 \cdot 0.3420 - 1.0 \cdot 0.7880}{1.523 \cdot 0.3420 + 1.0 \cdot 0.7880} \right)^2 \approx \left( \frac{-0.2673}{1.3087} \right)^2 \approx 0.0417 \, (4.17\%)
     \]

   - For p-polarization (\( R_p \)):
     \[
     R_p = \left( \frac{n_1 \cos \theta_i - n_2 \cos \theta_t}{n_1 \cos \theta_i + n_2 \cos \theta_t} \right)^2
     \]
     Substituting values:
     \[
     R_p = \left( \frac{0.3420 - 1.201}{0.3420 + 1.201} \right)^2 \approx \left( \frac{-0.859}{1.543} \right)^2 \approx 0.309 \, (30.9\%)
     \]

3. **Average Reflectance**: Since the light is unpolarized:
   \[
   R = \frac{R_s + R_p}{2} = \frac{4.17\% + 30.9\%}{2} \approx 17.5\%
   \]

### Part (b): Ratio of E-Components in the Reflected Beam
The ratio of the \( E \)-vector components in the plane of incidence (p-polarization) to those perpendicular to the plane (s-polarization) is given by:
\[
\text{Ratio} = \sqrt{\frac{R_p}{R_s}} = \sqrt{\frac{30.9\%}{4.17\%}} \approx \sqrt{7.41} \approx 2.73
\]

### Final Answer
The fraction of the incident light reflected is approximately \( 17.5\% \), and the ratio of the \( E \)-components is approximately \( 2.73 \). These values correspond to **Option E**.

**Answer: E**
