Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about groups in abstract algebra. Hmm, I remember that a group is a set equipped with an operation that satisfies four properties: closure, associativity, has an identity element, and every element has an inverse. Let me go through each option and see which one doesn't qualify as a group.

Option A: The integers under addition. I think this is a classic example of a group. Integers are closed under addition, addition is associative, there's an identity element which is 0, and every integer has an inverse (like negative numbers). So A is a group.

Option B: The positive real numbers under multiplication. Positive reals are closed under multiplication, multiplication is associative. The identity element is 1, and every positive real has a multiplicative inverse (1 divided by the number). So B is also a group.

Option C: The nonzero integers under multiplication. Wait, let me think. Nonzero integers under multiplication. Are they closed? Yes, because multiplying two nonzero integers gives a nonzero integer. Associativity holds because multiplication is associative. Identity is 1, which is there. But wait, do all elements have inverses? The inverse of an integer a would be 1/a, but 1/a is only an integer if a is 1 or -1. For example, the inverse of 2 would be 1/2, which isn't an integer. So not all elements have inverses here. Therefore, C is not a group.

Option D: The complex numbers under addition. Complex numbers are closed under addition, addition is associative. The identity is 0, and every complex number has an additive inverse (its negative). So D is a group.

Option E: The nonzero real numbers under multiplication. They're closed under multiplication, associative, identity is 1, and every nonzero real has a multiplicative inverse. So E is a group.

So the one that's NOT a group is option C. Because not all elements have inverses under multiplication.

The integers under addition (A) form a group because they satisfy closure, associativity, identity, and inverses. Positive real numbers under multiplication (B) also form a group as they meet all group criteria. Nonzero integers under multiplication (C) fail because not all elements have multiplicative inverses within the set. Complex numbers under addition (D) and nonzero real numbers under multiplication (E) are both groups. Therefore, the answer is C.

Answer: C
