Okay, so I need to figure out the acceptable size of the wire rope for this mine hoist problem. Let's start by understanding what's given and what I need to find.

The problem states that a mine hoist lifts a load of 8.0 tons from a depth of 700 feet. The rope's speed is 1500 feet per minute, and it reaches this speed in 10 seconds. I need to calculate the wire rope diameter that's acceptable for pulling the hoist upward, choosing from the given options A to J.

First, I think I need to calculate the power or the force involved. Since the hoist is lifting a load, the force would be the weight of the load. The load is 8.0 tons. I remember that 1 ton is approximately 2000 pounds, so 8 tons would be 8 * 2000 = 16,000 pounds. So the force needed to lift this load is 16,000 pounds.

Next, I need to find the power required. Power is force multiplied by velocity. The velocity here is given as 1500 fpm, but I think I need to convert this into feet per second to match the units of the time given (10 seconds). Since 1 minute is 60 seconds, 1500 fpm is 1500/60 = 25 feet per second.

So the velocity is 25 ft/s. Now, power P = F * v. F is 16,000 pounds, v is 25 ft/s. So P = 16,000 * 25 = 400,000 horsepower? Wait, no, that can't be right. Oh wait, no, because the units would be in horsepower, but I think I'm mixing units here. Wait, no—actually, power in foot-pounds per second would be 16,000 lb * 25 ft/s = 400,000 ft-lbf/s. To convert that to horsepower, since 1 horsepower is about 550 ft-lbf/s, so 400,000 / 550 ≈ 727 horsepower. That seems quite high, but maybe that's correct for a mine hoist.

Wait, but maybe I don't need the power. Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the tensile stress on the wire rope. The tensile stress would be the force per unit area of the rope. The force is 16,000 pounds, and the area would be based on the diameter of the rope.

So the formula for tensile stress σ = F / A, where A is the cross-sectional area of the rope. The area A for a circle is πr², which can be written as (π/4) * d², where d is the diameter. So A = (π/4) * d².

I think the acceptable stress for wire rope is usually around 150,000 psi (pounds per square inch), but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe it's lower, like 125,000 psi? I'll go with 150,000 psi as a common value for steel wire ropes.

So, setting up the equation: F = σ * A → F = σ * (π/4) * d². Rearranging to solve for d: d² = (4F) / (πσ). Then d = sqrt( (4F) / (πσ) )

Plugging in the numbers: F = 16,000 lb, σ = 150,000 psi.

Calculating numerator: 4 * 16,000 = 64,000.

Denominator: π * 150,000 ≈ 3.1416 * 150,000 ≈ 471,239.

So d² = 64,000 / 471,239 ≈ 0.1358. Taking square root: d ≈ sqrt(0.1358) ≈ 0.368 inches. Wait, that can't be right because none of the options are that small. The smallest option is J: 0.75 inches, and that's way bigger than 0.368. Did I make a mistake somewhere?

Wait, maybe I messed up the units. Let me check again. Oh wait, the force is 16,000 pounds, but that's the total force. But wire ropes are usually rated based on the stress per strand or something else? Or perhaps I'm using the wrong stress value.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the rope's breaking strength and use a safety factor. Maybe the rope's minimum breaking strength (MBS) is what I should use, and then apply a safety factor. For example, if the MBS is given by the formula MBS = (d²) * K, where K is a constant based on the material and construction.

Wait, I think the formula for the minimum breaking strength (MBS) of a wire rope is MBS = (d²) * 17,000 (psi) approximately, but I'm not sure about the exact value. Alternatively, perhaps it's MBS ≈ (d²) * 14,000 psi for general use. Let me think.

Wait, another approach: the wire rope's breaking strength can be found using the formula MBS = (d^2) * 14,000 psi. So if I set MBS equal to the force required (16,000 lb), then:

16,000 = d² * 14,000

Wait, but that would give d² = 16,000 / 14,000 ≈ 1.14286, so d ≈ sqrt(1.14286) ≈ 1.07 inches. Hmm, that's about 1 inch, which is option G. But looking at the options, I see option H is 1.5 inches, which is larger. But wait, I think this approach might not be correct because the MBS is usually higher than the actual load to allow for a safety factor. So perhaps I should calculate the required MBS and then find the rope diameter that provides that MBS, considering a safety factor.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula where the rope's diameter is based on the load and the speed, considering the power or the energy. But I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, let me try again. The force is 16,000 lb. The tensile stress σ is F/A, and I'll assume a maximum allowable stress of 150,000 psi. So:

A = F / σ = 16,000 / 150,000 ≈ 0.1067 sq in.

Then, area A = (π/4) d² → d² = (4A)/π → d² = (4 * 0.1067)/3.1416 ≈ 0.1358 → d ≈ 0.368 inches. But that's way too small, as the options don't go below 0.5 inches. So perhaps my assumption about the allowable stress is wrong.

Wait, maybe I should consider the rope's ability to handle the force with a safety factor. Let's say the safety factor is 5, which is common. So the required MBS would be F * safety factor = 16,000 * 5 = 80,000 lb.

Then, MBS = (d²) * 14,000 → 80,000 = d² * 14,000 → d² = 80000 / 14000 ≈ 5.714 → d ≈ sqrt(5.714) ≈ 2.39 inches. Hmm, but that's not an option either. The options go up to 3 inches, but the closest is I: 2.25 inches.

Wait, perhaps the formula is MBS = (d^2) * 14,000. Let me check that. If d is 2 inches, then MBS = 4 *14,000 = 56,000 lb. If d is 2.25 inches, MBS = (2.25)^2 *14,000 = 5.0625 *14,000 ≈70,875 lb. So 70,875 lb would be the MBS for 2.25 inches. Then, the required MBS with a safety factor of 5 would be F * 5 = 16,000 *5 =80,000 lb. So 70,875 is less than 80,000, so 2.25 inches would not be sufficient. So we'd need a larger diameter, but the next option is C:3 inches. MBS for 3 inches would be 9 *14,000 =126,000 lb. That's more than 80,000, so that would work. But 3 inches is a big diameter, and perhaps the options don't have a 2.5 inch option? Wait, looking back, option F is 2.5 inches. So let's check that. For d=2.5 inches, MBS= (2.5)^2 *14,000 =6.25 *14,000=87,500 lb. That's more than 80,000, so that would be acceptable. So the required diameter would be 2.5 inches, which is option F.

Wait, but earlier I thought the acceptable stress was 150,000 psi, but that led to a too-small diameter. Now, using MBS with a safety factor, I'm getting a larger diameter. So maybe the correct approach is to use the MBS formula with a safety factor.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the power and then find the required motor size, but I'm not sure if that's necessary here.

Wait, let's try another approach. The power required is force times velocity. F=16,000 lb, v=25 ft/s. So P=16,000 *25=400,000 ft-lbf/s. To convert to horsepower, divide by 550: 400,000 /550 ≈727 HP. That's a lot, but perhaps the motor can handle it. But I'm not sure how that helps with the rope diameter.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the rope's ability to handle the load based on its breaking strength. The wire rope's breaking strength (MBS) is often calculated as MBS = (d^2) * 14,000 lb. So if I need the MBS to be at least F * safety factor, say 5 times 16,000 lb=80,000 lb.

So, MBS = d^2 * 14,000 >=80,000 → d^2 >=80,000 /14,000 ≈5.714 → d >=sqrt(5.714)≈2.39 inches. So the next available option larger than 2.39 inches is option I:2.25 inches? No, 2.25 is less than 2.39. So the next is F:2.5 inches. So the acceptable size would be 2.5 inches, option F.

But wait, looking back, the options don't have 2.39 inches, but option I is 2.25, which is smaller than required. So the next option is F:2.5 inches, which would provide an MBS of 6.25 *14,000=87,500 lb, which is sufficient for the required 80,000 lb (with a safety factor of 5).

Alternatively, maybe the safety factor is different. If the safety factor is lower, say 4, then required MBS is 64,000 lb. Then d^2=64000/14000≈4.571 → d≈2.137 inches. That would require a rope of at least 2.14 inches, which is not an option. The options are 2 inches (D), 2.25 (I), 2.5 (F). So 2 inches would give MBS=4 *14,000=56,000 lb, which is less than 64,000, so not enough. 2.25 inches gives 70,875 lb, which is more than 64,000, so that would work. So if the safety factor is 4, then 2.25 inches (option I) would be acceptable.

But the problem doesn't specify the safety factor, which complicates things. Maybe I should assume a standard safety factor, perhaps 5 or 4. Let me see what the options give.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is more about the rope's ability to handle the load without considering the safety factor, just based on the tensile stress. So using σ=F/A, with σ=150,000 psi, F=16,000 lb, then A=16,000/150,000≈0.1067 sq in. Then, A=(π/4)d² → d²= (4A)/π → (4*0.1067)/3.1416≈0.1358 → d≈0.368 inches. But none of the options are that small, so perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the speed is irrelevant here, as the question is about the static load. The speed might affect the dynamic loading, but perhaps for this problem, we're only considering the static force.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the question is about the rope's ability to handle the load based on its diameter and the maximum force. So, using the formula:

Minimum diameter d = sqrt( (4F) / (π * σ) )

Where F is the load in pounds, σ is the tensile strength in psi.

So, F=16,000 lb, σ=150,000 psi.

d = sqrt( (4*16,000) / (π*150,000) )

Calculate numerator: 4*16,000=64,000.

Denominator: π*150,000≈471,239.

So, 64,000 /471,239≈0.1358.

d = sqrt(0.1358)≈0.368 inches.

Again, that's way too small. So perhaps the approach is wrong.

Wait, maybe the formula uses the breaking strength without a safety factor, so MBS = d² * 14,000 lb.

So, to carry 16,000 lb, the MBS needs to be at least 16,000 lb. So:

d² = 16,000 /14,000 ≈1.14286 → d≈1.07 inches. So option G is 1 inch, which is close but smaller than required. So perhaps the correct choice would be the next size up, which is H:1.5 inches, but that's a big jump. Alternatively, maybe the formula includes a safety factor. Let's say MBS = F * safety factor.

If I take a safety factor of 5, then MBS =16,000 *5=80,000 lb.

d²=80,000/14,000≈5.714 → d≈2.39 inches. So the closest option is I:2.25 inches, but that's still smaller. Alternatively, the next option is F:2.5 inches, which would give MBS=2.5² *14,000=6.25*14,000=87,500 lb, which is sufficient.

So, considering a safety factor, the acceptable diameter would be 2.5 inches (option F).

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for MBS is different. I think the correct formula for MBS is MBS = (d^2) * 14,000 lb, so for a 2.5-inch rope, MBS=6.25 *14,000=87,500 lb, which is more than the required 80,000 lb with a safety factor of 5. So option F would be the acceptable size.

But wait, let me double-check the options. The options are A:1.75, B:1.25, C:3, D:2, E:0.5, F:2.5, G:1, H:1.5, I:2.25, J:0.75.

If I go with the MBS approach with a safety factor of 5, the required MBS is 80,000 lb. So:

For option F (2.5 inches): MBS=2.5² *14,000=6.25*14,000=87,500 lb >80,000 → acceptable.

Option I (2.25): MBS=5.0625*14,000≈70,875 lb <80,000 → not acceptable.

So the acceptable size is F:2.5 inches.

To determine the acceptable wire rope diameter for lifting an 8.0-ton load, the following steps were taken:

1. **Calculate the Load in Pounds**:  
   The load is 8.0 tons, and since 1 ton ≈ 2000 pounds, the load is:  
   \[
   F = 8.0 \times 2000 = 16,000 \, \text{lb}.
   \]

2. **Determine the Required Minimum Breaking Strength (MBS)**:  
   The MBS of the wire rope must be sufficient to handle the load with a safety factor. Assuming a safety factor of 5 (common in hoisting applications):  
   \[
   \text{MBS} = F \times \text{safety factor} = 16,000 \times 5 = 80,000 \, \text{lb}.
   \]

3. **Relate MBS to Wire Rope Diameter**:  
   The MBS of a wire rope can be approximated by the formula:  
   \[
   \text{MBS} = d^2 \times 14,000 \, \text{lb},
   \]  
   where \(d\) is the diameter in inches. Rearranging for \(d\):  
   \[
   d = \sqrt{\frac{\text{MBS}}{14,000}}.
   \]

4. **Calculate the Required Diameter**:  
   Substituting \(\text{MBS} = 80,000 \, \text{lb}\):  
   \[
   d = \sqrt{\frac{80,000}{14,000}} = \sqrt{5.714} \approx 2.39 \, \text{inches}.
   \]

5. **Select the Closest Option**:  
   Among the given options, the closest diameter greater than 2.39 inches is **2.5 inches** (option F). This ensures the MBS of the rope is sufficient to handle the load with the applied safety factor.

**Answer**:  
F
