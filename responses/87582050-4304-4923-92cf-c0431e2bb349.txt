Okay, so I have this question about my aunt's apple pie business and which situation would increase her demand for labor. Let me try to break this down.

First, I need to understand what the question is asking. The aunt runs a small firm making apple pies and hires some friends. The question is about what situation would most likely increase her demand for labor. So, essentially, what makes her need more workers.

Let me look at each option one by one.

Option A: Government introduces a new tax on apple pie sales. Hmm, a tax would probably increase the cost of selling pies. If she has to pay more in taxes, her profits might go down. That could mean she might not hire as many people because her margins are lower. So this might actually decrease demand for labor, not increase it. So probably not A.

Option B: Price of apple peelers/corers rises. Apple peelers and corers are tools she uses in production. If their price goes up, her costs of production would increase. To make the same number of pies, each pie would cost more. If her costs go up, maybe she can't afford to make as many pies unless she sells them for a higher price. But if she can't raise prices, she might reduce production, which would mean needing fewer workers. So B might decrease labor demand.

Option C: Price of apples falls. Apples are a key ingredient in her pies. If apples become cheaper, her cost to make each pie goes down. That means each pie is more profitable. So with lower costs, she might be able to make more pies without increasing her expenses too much. More pies mean she might need more workers to keep up with production. So C seems like a good candidate for increasing labor demand.

Option D: There's a sale on ovens. Ovens are part of the equipment she uses. If ovens are on sale, she might buy more ovens. More ovens could allow her to bake more pies at the same time, increasing production capacity. But does that directly increase the need for more workers? Maybe not immediately. She could possibly use the same number of workers more efficiently with more ovens, but if she's constrained by oven capacity, maybe she needs more workers to manage more ovens. Alternatively, maybe she doesn't need more workers if she can manage with the same staff. Not sure, but maybe D isn't the best option.

Option E: New study says apples increase cancer risk. That's bad for sales. If people think apples are worse for health, they might buy fewer pies. Lower demand would mean she might produce less, needing fewer workers. So E would decrease labor demand, not increase it.

Option F: Aunt's friends start their own apple pie businesses. If her friends leave to start their own, that would mean her workforce is getting smaller. So she might have fewer workers, which reduces her labor demand. Alternatively, if her friends are leaving, maybe she can expand her business more? Not sure, but I think F would lead to her having fewer workers, not more. So probably not F.

Option G: Celebrity endorses a different brand of apple pie. If a well-known celebrity endorses a competitor's pie, that could divert some customers to them. Lower sales for my aunt would mean she might produce less, needing fewer workers. So G would likely decrease labor demand.

Option H: TV show features making apple pies at home. That could be a positive or negative. If the show teaches people how to make pies, maybe more people try making their own, reducing demand for her pies. Alternatively, it could spark interest and make her pies more popular. But if more people start making their own, that might lower her sales. So H might decrease her demand, leading to less labor needed. Or maybe if the show makes her pies more popular, she needs more workers. But I'm not sure. It might not directly affect her labor demand unless it increases her sales.

Option I: Aunt switches to pumpkin pies. If she changes her product, she's no longer making apple pies. So the question is about apple pie labor demand, so if she stops making them, her demand for labor related to apple pies would drop. So I would decrease labor demand for apple pies.

Option J: Friends gossip and slow dough-making. This would make her workers less efficient. If they're slower, she might need more workers to meet the same production targets. Alternatively, she might have to work longer hours or maybe even fire some if efficiency drops too much. But if the gossip slows them down, perhaps she needs to hire more to compensate for the lost time. So J could increase labor demand because she needs more workers to keep up with the same output, given that each worker is less productive.

Wait, but the question is which situation would most likely increase her demand for labor. So looking back, the options that increase labor demand are those that increase her need to produce more pies, leading her to hire more people.

From the options, C (cheaper apples) would lower her production costs, allowing her to make more pies, thus needing more workers. J, where her friends are slow, might require her to hire more to maintain production, but that's a negative scenario. Alternatively, if her costs go down, she can produce more with the same labor, but if she wants to increase output, she needs more workers.

Wait, no—if apples are cheaper, each pie is more profitable. So she can either lower prices and sell more, or keep prices the same and make more profit. Either way, she might want to produce more pies. To make more pies, she might need to hire more workers. So C seems like a strong candidate.

J, on the other hand, is about her current workers being less efficient. So she might have to hire more to compensate for the slower pace. But is that a likely scenario? It depends on whether she can manage with the same number of workers or if she's constrained by time. If the gossip is making them slow, she might need to hire more to meet the same production targets, but perhaps it's more of a negative scenario. Alternatively, she might try to fire some and hire others, but the question is about situations that increase labor demand.

So between C and J, which is more likely to increase her demand for labor.

Option C: Lower cost of apples makes each pie cheaper to produce. So she can make more pies with the same labor, but if she wants to increase production, she needs more labor. Alternatively, if she can produce more without hiring more, her labor demand might not increase. Wait, no—she can produce more pies with the same labor because each pie is cheaper, but if she wants to maximize output, she might need to hire more to make more pies. Or, perhaps her labor demand increases because she can now make more pies with the same number of workers, but that doesn't necessarily mean she needs more labor—it could mean she can produce more without hiring more. Hmm, this is a bit confusing.

Wait, no. The demand for labor is how much labor she wants to hire. If apples are cheaper, her cost per pie is lower, so the profit per pie is higher. That might mean she wants to produce more pies. To produce more pies, she needs more labor. So yes, lower cost of apples would lead to higher production, thus higher labor demand.

So C is a good candidate.

J: If her workers are less efficient, she might need more workers to produce the same number of pies. So her labor demand increases because each worker is less productive, so she needs more bodies to get the same output. But is that the case? Or would she try to find more efficient workers or ways to manage?

But the question is about which situation would increase her demand for labor. So both C and J could potentially increase labor demand, but which is more likely.

I think C is a more straightforward increase in labor demand because cheaper apples allow her to produce more pies, thus needing more workers. Whereas J is about inefficiency, which might lead her to need more workers, but it's a bit less direct.

So the answer is C.
</think>

The situation that would most likely increase your aunt's demand for labor is when the price of apples falls. This is because apples are a key ingredient in her pies, and lower prices would reduce her production costs, allowing her to produce more pies profitably. To meet the increased production demand, she would need to hire more workers.

Answer: C
