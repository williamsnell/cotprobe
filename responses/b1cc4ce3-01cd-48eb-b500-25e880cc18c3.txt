Okay, so I need to figure out which option best summarizes Carl Rogers' view of personality. I remember that Rogers was a big name in psychology, especially in the humanistic approach. Let me think about what I know about him.

Rogers emphasized the concept of the "fully functioning person" and believed in the inherent goodness of people. He talked a lot about self-actualization, which is the idea that people have a drive to fulfill their potential. So, he probably had a positive view of personality traits.

Looking at the options:

A: Talks about social roles and expectations. That sounds more like something from social learning theory or maybe even structuralism, not exactly Rogers.

B: Mainly formed by behavioral expectations. That seems more Skinnerian, focusing on behaviorism, which isn't Rogers' approach.

C: Personality traits are mostly negative and destructive. That doesn't fit because Rogers was optimistic about people's potential.

D: Genetic makeup. I don't think Rogers focused much on genetics; he was more about environment and personal growth.

E: Traits are overwhelmingly positive and goal-directed. This seems more aligned with Rogers' emphasis on self-actualization and positive growth.

F: Unconscious desires and conflicts. That's more Freudian, not Rogers.

G: Traits are constant over time. Rogers' theory, if I recall, allows for change and growth, so traits might not be constant.

H: Personality is constant and unchanging. Again, Rogers believed in growth and change, so this doesn't fit.

I: Vary based on traits, emotions, thought processes. This is more general and might apply to many theories, but not specific to Rogers.

J: Result of external environment. While environment does play a role, Rogers also emphasized the internal drive towards self-improvement, which isn't solely about external factors.

So, putting it together, option E seems to best capture Rogers' view because he focused on positive aspects and the goal-directed nature of personality towards self-actualization.
