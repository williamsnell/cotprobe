Question:

This question refers to the following information.
The man who mounted the steps of the Capitol, March 4, 1801, to claim the place of an equal between Pitt and Bonaparte, possessed a character which showed itself in acts; but person and manner can be known only by contemporaries, and the liveliest description was worth less than a moment of personal contact. Jefferson was very tall, six feet two-and-a-half inches in height; sandy-complexioned; shy in manner, seeming cold; awkward in attitude, and with little in his bearing that suggested command.… His skin was thin, peeling from his face on exposure to the sun, giving it a tettered appearance. This sandy face, with hazel eyes and sunny aspect; this loose, shackling person; this rambling and often brilliant conversation, belonged to the controlling influences of American history, more necessary to the story than three-fourths of the official papers, which only hid the truth. Jefferson's personality during these eight years appeared to be the government, and impressed itself, like that of Bonaparte, although by a different process, on the mind of the nation. In the village simplicity of Washington, he was more than a king, for he was alone in social as well as in political pre-eminence. Except the British Legation, no house in Washington was open to general society; the whole mass of politicians, even the Federalists, were dependent on Jefferson and "The Palace" for amusement; and if they refused to go there, they "lived like bears, brutalized and stupefied."

Alright, so I've got this question here about Henry Adams and his perspective on Thomas Jefferson. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the question is asking what we might expect Henry Adams to be, given that he's the great-grandson of President John Adams. The options are A through J, and I need to pick the right one.

I remember that John Adams was a Founding Father, the second president of the United States, and a key figure in the early history of the country. His son, John Quincy Adams, was also a president. So, Henry Adams is from a prominent political family, specifically with Federalist leanings because John Adams was a Federalist.

Looking at the passage provided, it's from Henry Adams' book about Jefferson's administration. The passage describes Jefferson in a somewhat critical light. It talks about Jefferson's physical appearance, his manner, and his impact on American history. The tone seems to suggest that Jefferson's personality was dominant, almost like a king in Washington, which might imply some admiration but also points out his unique presence. However, the passage doesn't explicitly say if Adams is pro or anti Jefferson, but it does mention that Jefferson's policies and personality were significant.

Now, considering that Henry Adams is the great-grandson of John Adams, who was a Federalist, it's likely that he would have Federalist sympathies. The Federalists were critical of Jefferson and his Democratic-Republican policies. They opposed the Democratic-Republicans, who they believed were too radical and aligned with the French Revolution, which they saw as chaotic.

Looking at the options, option J says "Biased towards the Federalists." That makes sense because Henry Adams comes from a Federalist background. His great-grandfather was a Federalist president, so it's reasonable to think he would have a bias towards them.

Option D says "Critical of the policies of Thomas Jefferson." While that could be true, the passage doesn't explicitly state that Adams is critical; it's more about Jefferson's impact. However, being a Federalist, Adams might have been critical of Jefferson's policies, but the question is about what we might expect, not what the passage says.

Option C is "Supportive of the policies of John Adams." John Adams was a different person, but the passage is about Jefferson. Also, the question is about Henry Adams, not John.

Option F is "Supportive of the policies of Thomas Jefferson." Given the family history, it's unlikely he'd support Jefferson's policies if he's a Federalist.

Option J seems the most fitting because it aligns with his family background and the political leanings that come with being a descendant of a Federalist president.

Henry Adams, as the great-grandson of President John Adams, would likely have Federalist sympathies. Given the historical context and his family's political background, it is reasonable to expect him to be biased towards the Federalists.

Answer: J
