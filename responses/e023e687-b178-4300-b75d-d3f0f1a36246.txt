Okay, so I've got this partial fraction problem to solve. The function is F(s) = (s + 2)/[(s + 1)^2 (s + 3)]. I need to find its partial fraction expansion and choose the correct option from A to J.

Hmm, partial fractions. Right, when you have a rational function, you can break it down into simpler fractions. The denominator here is (s + 1)^2 times (s + 3), so it's a repeated linear factor and another distinct linear factor. 

I remember that for repeated linear factors, each power gets its own term. So in this case, for (s + 1)^2, I should have two terms: one with 1/(s + 1) and another with 1/(s + 1)^2. The (s + 3) factor will have one term. So the general form should be:

F(s) = A/(s + 1) + B/(s + 1)^2 + C/(s + 3)

Yes, that's right. Now, I need to find the constants A, B, and C.

To find A, B, and C, I'll start by expressing F(s) as the sum of those three fractions. So,

(s + 2)/[(s + 1)^2 (s + 3)] = A/(s + 1) + B/(s + 1)^2 + C/(s + 3)

I can multiply both sides by the denominator (s + 1)^2 (s + 3) to eliminate the fractions:

s + 2 = A(s + 1)(s + 3) + B(s + 3) + C(s + 1)^2

Now, I need to expand the right side and then collect like terms to match the coefficients on both sides.

Expanding each term:

A(s + 1)(s + 3) = A(s^2 + 4s + 3)
B(s + 3) = Bs + 3B
C(s + 1)^2 = C(s^2 + 2s +1)

So putting it all together:

s + 2 = A(s^2 +4s +3) + Bs +3B + C(s^2 +2s +1)

Now, expand:

= A s^2 +4A s +3A + B s +3B + C s^2 +2C s + C

Now, group like terms:

s^2 terms: (A + C)s^2
s terms: (4A + B + 2C)s
constant terms: 3A +3B + C

So the equation becomes:

s + 2 = (A + C)s^2 + (4A + B + 2C)s + (3A + 3B + C)

Now, equate the coefficients on both sides. On the left side, the coefficients are:

s^2: 0
s: 1
constant term: 2

So, setting up the equations:

1. A + C = 0 (coefficient of s^2)
2. 4A + B + 2C = 1 (coefficient of s)
3. 3A + 3B + C = 2 (constant term)

Now, I have three equations with three variables: A, B, C.

Let me write them again:

1. A + C = 0
2. 4A + B + 2C = 1
3. 3A + 3B + C = 2

From equation 1, I can express A in terms of C: A = -C.

Let's substitute A = -C into equations 2 and 3.

Equation 2 becomes:
4*(-C) + B + 2C = 1
=> -4C + B + 2C =1
=> (-4C +2C) + B =1
=> -2C + B =1 --> equation 2a

Equation 3 becomes:
3*(-C) +3B + C =2
=> -3C +3B + C =2
=> (-3C +C) +3B =2
=> -2C +3B=2 --> equation 3a

Now, I have:

Equation 2a: -2C + B =1

Equation 3a: -2C +3B =2

Let me subtract equation 2a from equation 3a to eliminate C.

( -2C +3B ) - ( -2C + B ) = 2 -1

-2C +3B +2C -B =1

( -2C +2C ) + (3B - B )=1

0 + 2B =1

So, 2B=1 --> B=1/2

Now plug B=1/2 into equation 2a:

-2C + (1/2) =1

-2C =1 -1/2 =1/2

C= (1/2)/(-2) = -1/4

So C= -1/4. Then from equation 1, A= -C = -(-1/4)=1/4

So now, A=1/4, B=1/2, C=-1/4

So the partial fraction decomposition is:

F(s)= (1/4)/(s+1) + (1/2)/(s+1)^2 + (-1/4)/(s+3)

Which can be written as:

F(s) = (1/4)/(s+1) + (1/2)/(s+1)^2 - (1/4)/(s+3)

Now, looking at the options:

Option G is: (1/2)/(s+1) + (1/4)/(s+1)^2 - (1/4)/(s+3)

Wait, no, let's check each option.

Looking again:

Option A: (1/5)/(s+1) + (2/5)/(s+1)^2 - (2/5)/(s+3) → Doesn't match.

Option B: (1/2)/(s+1) - (1/2)/(s+1)^2 + (1/4)/(s+3) → Signs don't match.

Option C: (3/4)/(s+1) - (1/8)/(s+1)^2 - (5/8)/(s+3) → Not matching.

Option D: (1/2)/(s+1)^2 + (1/4)/(s+1) - (1/4)/(s+3) → The order is different but let's see.

Wait, my result is (1/4)/(s+1) + (1/2)/(s+1)^2 - (1/4)/(s+3). Let's check option G.

Option G: (1/2)/(s+1) + (1/4)/(s+1)^2 - (1/4)/(s+3). No, the coefficients don't match. Wait, my A is 1/4, B is 1/2, C is -1/4.

Option E: (1/6)/(s+1) + (1/3)/(s+1)^2 - (1/2)/(s+3) → No.

Option F: (1/2)/(s+1) + (1/4)/(s+1) + (1/4)/(s+3) → No, signs and terms wrong.

Option G: (1/2)/(s+1) + (1/4)/(s+1)^2 - (1/4)/(s+3) → A is 1/2, but I have A as 1/4. Doesn't match.

Wait, did I make a mistake in solving the equations?

Wait, let's double-check the equations.

Earlier steps:

After substitution, equation 2a: -2C + B =1

Equation 3a: -2C +3B=2

From equation 2a, B=1 +2C.

Substitute into equation 3a:

-2C +3*(1 +2C)=2

-2C +3 +6C=2

(4C) +3=2

4C= -1 → C= -1/4.

So that's correct.

Then A= -C=1/4.

So the partial fractions:

A/(s+1)= (1/4)/(s+1)

B/(s+1)^2= (1/2)/(s+1)^2

C/(s+3)= (-1/4)/(s+3)

So the correct expression is (1/4)/(s+1) + (1/2)/(s+1)^2 - (1/4)/(s+3)

Looking back at the options, let's check each one.

Option G: (1/2)/(s+1) + (1/4)/(s+1)^2 - (1/4)/(s+3) → A=1/2, but I have A=1/4. So not G.

Option D: (1/2)/(s+1)^2 + (1/4)/(s+1) - (1/4)/(s+3) → So A=1/4, B=1/2 → So the terms are (1/4)/(s+1) and (1/2)/(s+1)^2. So in D, the first term is (1/2)/(s+1)^2, the second is (1/4)/(s+1). So that would be:

(1/2)/(s+1)^2 + (1/4)/(s+1) - (1/4)/(s+3) → Which is the same as my result, just written in a different order. Because addition is commutative, so the order doesn't matter. So let me check:

Yes, because (1/4)/(s+1) + (1/2)/(s+1)^2 - (1/4)/(s+3) is the same as (1/2)/(s+1)^2 + (1/4)/(s+1) - (1/4)/(s+3). So option D.

Wait, but I thought my A was 1/4 and B was 1/2. So in option D, the first term is (1/2)/(s+1)^2 and the second is (1/4)/(s+1), which matches my B and A. So yes, D would be correct.

Wait, but earlier when I looked at option D, I thought it had (1/2)/(s+1)^2 first, but I have (1/4)/(s+1) first. But since addition is commutative, the order doesn't change the expression. So D would be correct.

Wait, but earlier I thought D was:

D: F(s) = [(1 / 2) / (s + 1)^2] + [(1 / 4) / (s + 1)] - [(1 / 4) / (s + 3)]

Which is exactly what I have. So yes, D is the correct option.

Wait, but let me look again at option G:

Option G: [(1 / 2) / (s + 1)] + [(1 / 4) / (s + 1)^2] - [(1 / 4) / (s + 3)]

No, that's A=1/2, B=1/4, which is different from my solution where A=1/4 and B=1/2.

So the correct option is D.
</think>

The partial fraction expansion of F(s) = (s + 2)/[(s + 1)^2 (s + 3)] is found by expressing it as A/(s + 1) + B/(s + 1)^2 + C/(s + 3). Solving the system of equations for A, B, and C yields A = 1/4, B = 1/2, and C = -1/4. Thus, F(s) = (1/4)/(s + 1) + (1/2)/(s + 1)^2 - (1/4)/(s + 3). Rearranging terms shows that this matches option D.

Answer: D
