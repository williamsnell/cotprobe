Okay, so I've got this question about horizontal versus vertical microarchitecture, and I need to figure out which statements are true. Let me start by recalling what I know about these concepts.

Microarchitecture refers to the detailed implementation of a computer's instruction set. There are two main approaches: horizontal and vertical. 

In horizontal microarchitecture, the instruction format is typically more efficient. Each instruction can specify multiple operations to be performed in parallel. This usually means that each instruction has a single opcode followed by multiple operand specifiers. So, for example, a single horizontal instruction might handle several operations at once, like fetching data, performing a calculation, and storing the result, all in one step.

On the other hand, vertical microarchitecture breaks down each instruction into multiple microinstructions. Each microinstruction handles a single operation. So, for a single high-level instruction, you might have several vertical microinstructions, each doing a part of the overall task. This approach can be more flexible but might require more time steps because each microinstruction is executed sequentially.

Now, let's look at the statements one by one.

Statement I: Programs for horizontal architectures require more time steps than those for vertical architectures.
Hmm, wait. I think the opposite might be true. Since horizontal instructions can do more in a single step, they might execute faster, requiring fewer time steps. So programs for horizontal architectures would take less time, not more. Therefore, Statement I is probably false.

Statement II: Horizontal microinstructions are unencoded.
I'm not too sure about this. Wait, horizontal microinstructions are usually encoded in a way that allows multiple operations per instruction. But I think unencoded might refer to a format where each field is explicitly specified. Actually, horizontal instructions are often encoded with a single opcode and multiple operands, so they are encoded. So Statement II is probably false because horizontal microinstructions are encoded, not unencoded. Wait, no, wait. Wait, in horizontal architectures, the microinstructions are typically encoded with a single opcode and multiple operands. So if Statement II says they are unencoded, that's incorrect. So II is false.

Statement III: Horizontal microinstructions usually have a single opcode and multiple operand specifiers.
Yes, that sounds right. Horizontal microinstructions are characterized by a single opcode followed by several operands. So this statement is true.

So let's recap:
I: False
II: False
III: True

Looking at the options, the correct choice should be the one where only III is true.

The options are:
A: I and III only → No, because I is false.
B: I, II, III → No.
C: III only → Yes.
D: I and II only → No.
E: All → No.
F: II only → No.
G: II and III → No, II is false.
H: I only → No.
I: None → No, because III is true.
J: II and III → No, II is false.

So the correct answer should be option C: III only.

The analysis shows that only Statement III is true. 

Answer: C
