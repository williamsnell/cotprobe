Okay, so I've got this economics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. The question is asking by how much investment must rise to bring about a $300 million change in income, given that the Marginal Propensity to Consume (MPC) is 0.75. The options are A through J, each with different amounts. 

Hmm, I remember that MPC is the fraction of additional income that people spend on consumption. So if MPC is 0.75, that means 75% of any extra income is spent, and the remaining 25% is saved. Wait, but investment is part of the economy, right? So how does that tie in?

I think this has to do with the multiplier effect. The multiplier effect explains how an initial change in spending can lead to a larger change in overall income. The formula for the multiplier is 1 divided by (1 minus MPC). Let me check that. Yeah, I think that's right: Multiplier (k) = 1 / (1 - MPC).

So plugging in the MPC of 0.75, the multiplier would be 1 / (1 - 0.75) = 1 / 0.25 = 4. That means that for every dollar of initial spending, income increases by $4.

Wait, but the question is about investment. Investment is a component of aggregate demand, right? So if investment increases, that's an increase in spending. The change in income would be the change in investment multiplied by the multiplier.

Let me clarify: If investment rises by X, then the total change in income (ΔY) would be X multiplied by the multiplier (k). So ΔY = X * k.

We know ΔY is $300 million, and k is 4. So rearranging the equation, X = ΔY / k. That would be X = 300M / 4 = 75 million.

Wait, that would make the required increase in investment $75 million. Looking at the options, E is $75M. So the answer should be E.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't mix up anything. Investment is part of the initial spending, so when it increases, it directly affects the income through the multiplier. Yes, so the calculation seems correct.

The required increase in investment is $75 million.
