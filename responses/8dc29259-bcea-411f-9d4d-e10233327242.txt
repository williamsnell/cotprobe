Question:

A company sells DVD players for $200 per unit. The players have a unit variable cost of $160. The company estimates that it will sell one home entertainment system for every four DVD players sold. Home entertainment systems have a unit variable cost of $460 and sell for $600 per unit. The company's fixed costs are $90000. Assuming that the sales mix estimate is correct how many DVD players need to be sold for the company to break even?

Options:

A: 300
B: 2000
C: 500
D: 400
E: 700
F: 1200
G: 1000
H: 800
I: 600
J: 1500

Okay, so I have this problem about a company selling DVD players and home entertainment systems. I need to figure out how many DVD players they need to sell to break even. Hmm, break-even analysis, right? I remember that break-even is when total revenue equals total costs, which includes fixed and variable costs.

Let me read the question again. The company sells DVD players for $200 each. The variable cost per unit is $160. So, for each DVD player, they make $200 and spend $160, which means the contribution margin is $40 per DVD player. That's straightforward.

Now, the company also sells home entertainment systems. They estimate selling one home system for every four DVD players sold. So, for every four DVDs, they sell one system. The home systems cost $460 each and sell for $600. So, the contribution margin for each system would be $600 minus $460, which is $140. That makes sense.

Fixed costs are $90,000. So, I need to calculate the break-even point, considering both products and their sales mix.

I think the approach is to consider the sales mix and calculate the total contribution margin per unit of the mix, then see how many such units are needed to cover fixed costs.

Wait, the sales mix is four DVD players to one system. So, every group of four DVDs sold comes with one system. So, the ratio is 4:1.

Let me break it down. For every four DVD players sold, they also sell one home system. So, one group is four DVDs plus one system.

So, per group, how much is the total contribution?

Each DVD contributes $40, so four DVDs contribute 4 * $40 = $160.

The home system contributes $140, so total contribution per group is $160 + $140 = $300.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I should think about it as a contribution per unit in terms of DVDs. Since for every 4 DVDs, they sell one system, perhaps the contribution per DVD in the mix is higher because each group of four DVDs plus one system contributes more.

Wait, maybe I should model it as a combined unit. So, each set consists of 4 DVDs and 1 system. The total contribution for this set is (4 * $40) + $140 = $160 + $140 = $300.

Fixed costs are $90,000. So, the number of such sets needed to break even would be $90,000 divided by $300 per set. That would be 90,000 / 300 = 300 sets.

Wait, but each set has four DVDs. So, the number of DVDs sold would be 4 * 300 = 1200 units. So, 1200 DVDs need to be sold. Let me check the options: Option F is 1200.

Wait, but let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I should calculate the weighted average contribution margin.

The contribution margin per DVD is $40, and per system is $140.

The sales mix is 4 DVDs per system, so the ratio is 4:1.

So, the total units in the mix are 4 DVDs + 1 system, making 5 units total. The total contribution for each group is $40*4 + $140 = $160 + $140 = $300, as before.

So, per group of 5 units (4 DVDs and 1 system), the contribution is $300. So, to cover fixed costs, number of groups needed is 90,000 / 300 = 300 groups.

Each group has 4 DVDs, so 300 * 4 = 1200 DVDs.

Yes, that makes sense. So, the answer should be 1200, which is option F.

The company sells DVD players and home entertainment systems in a 4:1 sales mix. Each DVD player has a contribution margin of $40, and each system has a contribution margin of $140. For every group of 4 DVDs and 1 system, the total contribution margin is $300. To cover fixed costs of $90,000, 300 such groups are needed, resulting in 1200 DVD players sold.
