Okay, so I have this question about the nth roots of unity forming a certain algebraic structure. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that the nth roots of unity are the complex numbers that satisfy the equation z^n = 1. These roots are evenly spaced around the unit circle in the complex plane. There are exactly n distinct roots for each n.

The question is asking what kind of structure this set forms under multiplication of complex numbers. The options are various types of groups or semigroups.

I know that a group requires four things: closure, associativity, identity element, and inverses. A semigroup only requires closure and associativity, but not necessarily identity or inverses. Also, the question is about whether the structure is commutative or not.

So, the set of nth roots of unity under multiplication. Let's check the properties.

Closure: If I take any two nth roots of unity, say a and b, then their product a*b should also be an nth root of unity. Because (a*b)^n = a^n * b^n = 1*1=1, so yes, closure holds.

Associativity: Multiplication of complex numbers is associative, so this holds.

Identity element: The number 1 is an nth root of unity (since 1^n =1), so the identity is present.

Inverses: For each root a, there's another root b such that a*b =1. Since a^n=1, a^(n-1) is the inverse because a * a^(n-1) = a^n =1. So inverses exist.

So the set is a group. Now, is it abelian or non-abelian?

Well, in the complex numbers, multiplication is commutative. So when multiplying any two roots a and b, a*b = b*a. Therefore, the group is abelian.

Looking at the options:

A: non-abelian group → No, because it's abelian.
B: infinite group → No, because there are exactly n elements, so it's finite.
C: commutative semigroup with identity → It's more than a semigroup; it's a group, so this isn't the best choice.
D: non-commutative group → No, it's commutative.
E: abelian group → Yes, this fits.
F: non-commutative semigroup with identity → No, it's commutative and a group.
G: semi group with identity → Again, it's a group, so this isn't the best choice.

So the correct answer should be E: abelian group.

The nth roots of unity form a finite set under multiplication, satisfying all group properties (closure, associativity, identity, inverses). Since multiplication is commutative, the group is abelian.

Answer: E
