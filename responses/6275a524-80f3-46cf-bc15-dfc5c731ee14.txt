Okay, so I've got this question about setting a target selling price for a new product called Duct. The target contribution margin is 20%, and I need to figure out what the target selling price should be. Alright, let's break this down step by step.

First, I should recall what a contribution margin is. Contribution margin is the difference between the selling price and the variable costs per unit. It's used to cover fixed costs and contribute to profit. The target contribution margin percentage tells us what portion of the selling price should be the contribution margin.

The formula for contribution margin is:
Contribution Margin = Selling Price - Variable Costs

And the contribution margin ratio (CMR) is:
CMR = (Contribution Margin) / Selling Price

In this case, the target CMR is 20%, or 0.2. So, 0.2 = (Selling Price - Variable Costs) / Selling Price.

Now, I need to identify the variable costs. Looking at the unit costs provided:
- Manufacturing costs: Variable is $12, Fixed is $8.
- Selling & admin costs: Variable is $3, Fixed is $5.

So, total variable costs per unit would be the sum of all variable manufacturing and selling/admin costs. That would be $12 (variable manufacturing) + $3 (variable selling/admin) = $15 in variable costs per unit.

Wait, is that right? Let me double-check. Yes, variable costs are those that change with production volumeâ€”so yes, $12 + $3 = $15.

The fixed costs are $8 (manufacturing) + $5 (selling/admin) = $13 per unit. But fixed costs are not considered in the contribution margin calculation because they don't change with the number of units sold. We only focus on variable costs for the CM.

So, the formula again is:
CMR = (Selling Price - Variable Costs) / Selling Price = 0.2

Let me denote Selling Price as P. So,
(P - 15) / P = 0.2

I can solve this equation for P. Let's do that.

Multiply both sides by P to get rid of the denominator:
P - 15 = 0.2 * P

Now, subtract 0.2P from both sides:
P - 0.2P - 15 = 0
0.8P - 15 = 0

Add 15 to both sides:
0.8P = 15

Now, divide both sides by 0.8:
P = 15 / 0.8
P = 18.75

Wait, that's $18.75. Let me check the options. Option A is $18.75, so that seems to be the answer.

But hold on, did I account for all variable costs correctly? I had manufacturing variable at $12 and selling/admin variable at $3. So yes, $15 total. The fixed costs are separate and don't factor into the contribution margin calculation. So yes, the calculation should be correct.

Alternatively, sometimes people get confused between target profit and just contribution margin. But the question is specifically about the target contribution margin, so we don't need to include fixed costs in the initial calculation. The contribution margin covers fixed costs and profit, but here we're just setting the margin based on the percentage.

So, the target selling price is $18.75, which is option A.

The target selling price for Duct, based on a 20% contribution margin, is calculated by considering the total variable costs per unit ($15) and solving for the price that achieves the desired margin ratio. The correct answer is **A: $18.75**.

Answer: A
