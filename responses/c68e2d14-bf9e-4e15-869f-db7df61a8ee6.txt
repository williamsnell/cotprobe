Question:

The ability to roll the tongue is conferred by a dom-inant gene while its recessive allele fails to confer this ability. If 16% of the students in a school can-not roll their tongues, what percentage of students are heterozygous.

B: 24 per cent
C: 36 per cent
D: 68 per cent
E: 40 per cent
F: 32 per cent
G: 48 per cent
H: 20 per cent
I: 64 per cent
J: 52 per cent

Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.

The question says that the ability to roll the tongue is conferred by a dominant gene. The recessive allele doesn't give that ability. So, in other words, if someone has at least one dominant allele, they can roll their tongue. If they have two recessive alleles, they can't.

The problem states that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. I need to find out what percentage of the students are heterozygous, meaning they have one dominant and one recessive allele.

Hmm, I think this is a Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium problem. The Hardy-Weinberg principle helps us find the frequencies of different genotypes in a population. The formula is p² + 2pq + q² = 1, where p is the frequency of the dominant allele, q is the frequency of the recessive allele, p² is the frequency of homozygous dominant, 2pq is heterozygous, and q² is homozygous recessive.

Wait, the problem says 16% can't roll their tongues, which means they have the recessive phenotype. Since the recessive phenotype only occurs when someone is homozygous recessive (q²), I can set that equal to 16% or 0.16.

So, q² = 0.16. To find q, I take the square root of 0.16. The square root of 0.16 is 0.4 because 0.4 * 0.4 = 0.16. So q = 0.4.

Since p + q = 1 (because these are the only two alleles), p must be 1 - q. So p = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6.

Now, I need to find the heterozygous frequency, which is 2pq. Plugging in the values: 2 * 0.6 * 0.4.

Let me calculate that. 0.6 times 0.4 is 0.24, and multiplying by 2 gives 0.48. So 0.48 is the frequency of heterozygous individuals.

To express this as a percentage, I multiply by 100, which gives 48%. Looking at the options, G is 48 per cent. So the answer should be G.

Wait, just to make sure I didn't mix up anything. The recessive phenotype is q², which is 16%, so q is 0.4. p is 0.6. Heterozygous is 2pq, which is 2*0.6*0.4=0.48, yes. So yes, 48% of the students are heterozygous.

The ability to roll the tongue is determined by a dominant gene (let's call it R) and its recessive allele (r). Students who cannot roll their tongues are homozygous recessive (rr). Given that 16% of the students cannot roll their tongues, this corresponds to q² = 0.16. Taking the square root, q = 0.4. Since p + q = 1, p = 0.6. The heterozygous frequency is 2pq = 2 * 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.48, or 48%. 

Answer: G
