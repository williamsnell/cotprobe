Alright, let's see what this problem is about. So, we've got an invoice, and we need to figure out the amount paid after some discounts and considering the terms. Hmm.

Okay, the invoice date is March 2nd, and the amount is $416.50. Then there are two successive discounts: 15% and 2.5%. Oh wait, the order of discounts might matter here. So first, we apply 15%, then 2.5% on the reduced amount. Or is it the other way around? The problem says "less 15% and 2(1/2)%", which I think means you apply each discount sequentially. So 15% off first, then 2.5% off the resulting amount.

Then, the terms are 2% and 10-EOM. I'm a bit fuzzy on what 10-EOM means. Wait, 10-EOM is like 10 days from the end of the month. So for March, the end is March 31, so 10 days later would be April 10. So the payment terms are 2% discount if paid within 10 days. Otherwise, you pay the full amount.

The payment was made on April 10. Let's see, from March 2 to April 10 is how many days? March has 31 days, so March 2 to March 31 is 29 days (since 31-2=29). Then April 10 is 10 days into April, making the total 29 +10=39 days. 

Wait, no. Wait, wait. Wait, the payment is on April 10, which is 10 days after March 31. So March 2 to April 10: March has 31 days, so from March 2 to March 31 is 29 days. Then April 10 is the 10th day of April. So total days after March 2 is 29 + 10 = 39 days. But the terms are 2% if paid within 10 days. So April 10 is exactly 10 days after March 31, which is March 2 + 39 days. So 39 is more than 10, so the 2% discount doesn't apply. So the full amount is due, right?

Wait, no. Wait, the terms are "terms of 2% 10-EOM". So 10-EOM is the term for 10 days. So any payment made within 10 days after the end of the month (EOM) gets the 2% discount. So March 2 is the invoice date. March 31 is EOM. So 10 days after March 31 is April 10. So if you pay on April 10, that's exactly 10 days after March 31. So according to the terms, you can get a 2% discount.

Wait, but I thought the terms are 2% for payment within 10 days of the end of the month. So April 10 is 10 days after March 31, so yes, that's within the 10-day period. So the 2% discount applies.

So the original amount is $416.50. First, apply 15% discount. Let me calculate that.

15% of 416.50 is 0.15 * 416.50. Let me compute that: 416.50 * 0.15. 400 * 0.15 is 60, 16.5 * 0.15 is 2.475. So total 62.475. So subtract that from 416.50: 416.50 - 62.475 = 354.025. Hmm, but wait, I might have miscalculated. Let me do it more accurately.

Wait, 416.50 * 0.15. 416.50 * 15 = 6247.5 (since 416.5 *15= 6247.5), so 15% is 624.75 cents? Wait, no, 416.50 *0.15 = 62.475. So 416.50 -62.475 = 354.025.

Then, apply the next discount of 2.5%. So 354.025 * 0.025 = 8.850625. Subtract that: 354.025 -8.850625 = 345.174375.

Wait, but wait, wait. Are the discounts applied sequentially, or are they multiplicative? Because 15% followed by 2.5% would mean that the second discount is on the reduced amount.

So yes, that's correct. So after the 15%, it's 354.025, then 2.5% off brings it down to approximately 354.025 * 0.975.

Wait, 0.975 is 100 -2.5% = 97.5% remaining. So 354.025 * 0.975.

Let me compute that. 354.025 * 0.975.

Hmm, 354 * 0.975 is 354 * (1 - 0.025) = 354 - (354 *0.025) = 354 -8.85 = 345.15.

Wait, but 0.975 is 97.5%, so the actual calculation is 354.025 * 0.975.

Let me compute 354.025 * 0.975:

First, 354.025 * 0.975 = ?

Alternatively, 354.025 * 975 / 1000.

So 354.025 *975 = ?

Wait, perhaps it's easier to do it step by step.

Let me compute 354.025 * 975.

Well, 354 *975 would be 345,150 (because 354 * 1000=354000, minus 354*25=8850, so 354000-8850=345150). Then 0.025 *975 = 24.375. So total is 345150 +24.375= 345174.375.

Now, this is divided by 1000: 345174.375 /1000= 345.174375.

So which is approximately $345.17.

Hmm, but the options are A:416.50, B:365.87, C:328.99, D:382.15, E:338.27, F:400.53, G:345.17, H:348.45, I:354.02, J:310.61.

So our calculation is 345.17, which is option G. But wait, because the payment was made on April 10, which is within the 10 days of EOM (March 31), so the 2% discount is applied. So the amount is 345.17, which is option G.

Wait, but let me check the initial calculation again. Maybe I made a mistake in the order of discounts.

Wait, another way: Let's think of the two discounts as a series. The first discount is 15%, which reduces the amount, then the second is 2.5%, which is applied to the already reduced amount.

So, 15% off: 416.50 * 0.85 = 352.575.

Then, 2.5% off: 352.575 * 0.975. Let me compute that.

352.575 * 0.975. Let's calculate:

352.575 * 0.975 = 352.575 * (1 - 0.025) = 352.575 - (352.575 * 0.025).

352.575 *0.025 = 8.814375.

So 352.575 -8.814375 = 343.760625.

So approximately $343.76, which is not one of the options, but the closest is option G at $345.17. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the initial calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should have applied the 2.5% discount before the 15%. Let's try that.

So, if the 2.5% is applied first: 416.50 * 0.975 = 416.50 * (97.5/100) = 416.50 *0.975.

Wait, 416.50 *0.975.

Let me compute it: 400 *0.975 = 390, 16.5 *0.975=16.1625. So total 390 +16.1625 = 406.1625.

Then, apply 15% discount: 406.1625 *0.85= 406.1625 * 0.85.

Compute 406.1625 *0.85: 400 *0.85 =340, 6.1625 *0.85= approx 5.238125. So total 345.238125.

So approximately $345.24. Again, not exactly matching the options. The closest is G: $345.17.

Wait, but perhaps I'm making a mistake. Let me try both approaches.

First approach: 15% then 2.5%. 

15% of 416.50 is 62.475, so 416.50 -62.475=354.025.

Then 2.5% of 354.025 is 8.850625. So 354.025 -8.850625= 345.174375 → ~$345.17.

Second approach: 2.5% first, then 15%: 

2.5% of 416.50 is 10.4125; so 416.50 -10.4125=406.0875.

Then 15% of 406.0875 is 60.913125. So 406.0875 -60.913125= 345.174375 → same as before.

Wait, that's the same result as the first approach. So both methods give approximately $345.17.

But let me check the calculation once more. Because the options have option G: 345.17, which matches.

But wait, why is one of the options H:348.45? Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something else. Let me check the payment terms again. The terms are 2% 10-EOM. So 10 days after March 31 (EOM), which is April 10. So the payment on April 10 is within the 10-day period, so 2% discount applies. So the amount is 345.17, which is option G.

Wait, but wait. Let's think about the credit terms. The invoice is dated March 2, amount $416.50, less 15% and 2.5%.

So the first step is to apply the 15% discount. That leaves 85% of 416.50, which is 352.575.

Then apply the 2.5% discount on that, which is 97.5% of 352.575, which is 345.17.

So the correct amount is $345.17, which is option G.

But let me look at the options again. The options include G as $345.17, which is what I calculated.

Wait, but wait, wait another thing: the payment terms are "terms of 2% 10-EOM". So does that mean 2% discount for payment within 10 days from the end of the month? So April 10 is exactly 10 days after March 31, so yes, 2% discount.

So yeah, the amount is $345.17, which is option G.
</think>

The invoice amount is $416.50, with discounts of 15% and 2.5%. The payment terms are 2% if paid within 10 days of the end of the month (EOM), which is April 10. 

1. **Apply the 15% discount**:  
   15% of $416.50 = $62.475.  
   Reduced amount = $416.50 - $62.475 = $354.025.

2. **Apply the 2.5% discount**:  
   2.5% of $354.025 = $8.850625.  
   Reduced amount = $354.025 - $8.850625 = $345.174375 ≈ $345.17.

Since the payment is made on April 10, which is exactly 10 days after March 31 (EOM), the 2% discount applies. The final amount to be paid is $345.17.
