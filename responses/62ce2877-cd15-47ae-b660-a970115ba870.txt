Okay, so I've got this equation to solve: -17.02 equals -2.3 times y. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I'm a bit rusty on algebra, but I remember that to solve for y, I need to isolate it on one side of the equation. 

Alright, the equation is -17.02 = -2.3y. So, I want to get y by itself. Since y is being multiplied by -2.3, I should divide both sides by -2.3 to undo that multiplication. 

Wait, let me make sure I'm doing this right. If I have a number multiplied by y, to isolate y, I divide both sides by that number. So, dividing both sides by -2.3 should give me y on one side. 

Let me write that out. So, starting with:

-17.02 = -2.3y

If I divide both sides by -2.3, it becomes:

(-17.02) / (-2.3) = y

Now, dividing two negative numbers will give me a positive result because negatives cancel out. So, the negatives will make the result positive. 

Next, I need to calculate what -17.02 divided by -2.3 is. Let me do the division step by step. 

First, ignoring the signs, I have 17.02 divided by 2.3. Hmm, 2.3 goes into 17 how many times? Let me think. 2.3 times 7 is 16.1 because 2.3*7=16.1. Subtracting that from 17 gives me 0.9. Then, bringing down the .02, I have 0.902. 

Wait, maybe I should approach it differently. Let me convert 2.3 into a whole number to make division easier. If I multiply both numerator and denominator by 10, I get 170.2 divided by 23. 

So, 23 goes into 170 how many times? Let's see: 23*7=161, which leaves 9. Bring down the 0, making it 90. 23 goes into 90 three times (23*3=69), leaving 21. Bring down the 2, making 212. 23 goes into 212 nine times because 23*9=207, leaving 5. Hmm, so so far I have 7.39... but wait, I think I made a mistake here because 23*7 is 161, and 170-161 is 9, right. Then 90 divided by 23 is 3 times, 69, leaving 21. Then 212 divided by 23 is 9 again because 23*9=207. So, putting it all together, it's 7.39 something. 

Wait, but I think I might have messed up the decimal placement. Let me try another approach. Let me calculate 17.02 divided by 2.3. 

I know that 2.3 times 7 is 16.1, as I thought earlier. So, 17.02 minus 16.1 is 0.92. Then, I have 0.92 left. Now, 2.3 goes into 0.92 how many times? Let's see: 2.3 * 0.4 = 0.92. So, 0.4 times. So, adding that to the 7, I get 7.4. So, 2.3 times 7.4 equals 17.02. 

Wait, but remember, both the original numbers were negative, so -17.02 divided by -2.3 is positive 7.4. 

So, y equals 7.4. Looking at the options, E is 7.4. 

Wait, but let me double-check my calculation to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me multiply 7.4 by -2.3 and see if I get -17.02. 

7.4 * 2.3: 7*2=14, 7*.3=2.1, 0.4*2=0.8, 0.4*.3=0.12. Adding them up: 14 + 2.1 is 16.1, plus 0.8 is 16.9, plus 0.12 is 17.02. So, 7.4 * 2.3 =17.02. But since both original terms were negative, -2.3 *7.4 would be -17.02, which matches the left side. 

Wait, no, actually, the equation is -17.02 = -2.3y. So, when I solve for y, y is 7.4, because (-2.3)*7.4 = -17.02. 

So, the answer should be E:7.4. Let me check the options again. 

Options are A: −7.4, B:14.72, C:10.2, D:12.5, E:7.4, F:-10.2, G:3.6, H:-3.6, I:-12.5, J:−19.32. 

So, E is 7.4, which is what I got. Therefore, the correct answer is E.

The equation to solve is −17.02 = −2.3y. To isolate y, divide both sides by −2.3:

y = (−17.02) / (−2.3) = 7.4.

Verifying by multiplying −2.3 by 7.4 gives −17.02, confirming the solution.
