Okay, so I've got this question about convolutional neural networks, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me see. The question is about determining the number of convolutional filters in the first layer given the output tensor size.

Alright, the input image is 28x28x3. That makes senseâ€”28 pixels in width, 28 in height, and 3 channels (since it's a color image, probably RGB). So the first layer is the convolutional layer, and the output tensor is 26x26x64. I need to find out how many filters were used in that first layer.

Hmm, I remember that in a convolutional layer, each filter is applied to the input image to produce a feature map. The number of filters determines the depth of the output tensor. Wait, but the output tensor here is 26x26x64. So the depth is 64. Does that mean the number of filters is 64? Because each filter contributes a single channel to the output.

Wait, but maybe I'm mixing things up. Let me think again. The input is 3 channels, so each filter in the first layer is a 3D filter that spans all the input channels. So each filter has dimensions (width, height, channels), right? So for example, a filter could be 5x5x3, and when applied, it reduces the spatial dimensions but increases the number of channels based on the number of filters.

Wait, but the output tensor's depth is 64. That should correspond to the number of filters in the first layer. Because each filter produces one feature map. So if the output has 64 channels, that should be 64 filters. So the answer would be D:64.

But wait, sometimes the filter size affects the output dimensions. Oh right, the output size is 26x26. How does that relate to the filter size? Let me think. The spatial size of the output depends on the filter size and the stride. Oh, but the question doesn't specify the filter size or the stride. So maybe I don't need that information to find the number of filters.

Because regardless of the filter size, the number of filters determines the depth of the output. So if the output is 26x26x64, the number of filters must be 64. So the answer is D.

Wait, but could there be any other factors? Like padding? No, because the output size here is 26, which is 28 minus 2. That suggests that the filter size is probably 3x3 with a stride of 1, because 28 - (3-1) = 26. But that's about the filter size, not the number of filters.

So yeah, the number of filters is the depth of the output, which is 64. So D is the correct answer.

The number of convolutional filters in the first layer is equal to the depth of the output tensor, which is 64.

Answer: D
