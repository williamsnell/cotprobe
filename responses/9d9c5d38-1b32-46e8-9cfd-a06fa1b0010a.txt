Okay, so I have this question about psychology concepts, and I need to figure out which one applies best to the given situation. Let me read the question again.

The question says that a friend says, "Every time I plan a vacation, there's always a crisis at home or work so that I can't go." And it's assumed this isn't really true. So I need to pick which cognitive bias or fallacy this illustrates.

Let me go through the options one by one.

Option A: Illusory correlation. That's when someone sees a relationship between two things that aren't actually related. So if my friend thinks that planning a vacation always leads to a crisis, maybe they're correlating the two even if there's no real connection. That seems possible.

Option B: Base rate fallacy. This is when someone ignores general statistical information in favor of specific, more vivid information. Not sure how that applies here; maybe not the best fit.

Option C: Cognitive dissonance. That's about holding conflicting thoughts and feeling discomfort. The friend might feel bad because they can't go on vacation, but their statement is about the reason, not the internal conflict.

Option D: Anchoring bias. That's when you rely too much on the first piece of information you hear. Doesn't seem relevant here.

Option E: Availability heuristic. This is when the brain overestimates the likelihood of events based on how easily examples come to mind. So if the friend easily recalls times when their plans were ruined, they might think it's more common than it is. That sounds relevant because they're probably focusing on the negative instances they can remember.

Option F: Fundamental attribution bias. This is about overemphasizing personal traits and underestimating situational factors. Not sure if that fits here.

Option G: Hindsight bias. That's when you think you knew something would happen after it did. Doesn't apply here.

Option H: Self-serving bias. This is when people take credit for successes but blame external factors for failures. The friend is blaming external crises, so maybe. But the question says it's not really true, so it's more about their perception than self-protecting.

Option I: Psychological reactance. This is about feeling the need to do the opposite of what someone suggests. Doesn't fit.

Option J: Confirmation bias. This is seeking information that supports existing beliefs. If the friend only pays attention to evidence that supports their belief that planning leads to crises, that could be it. But the question says it's not really true, so maybe it's more about how they perceive the frequency of crises.

Wait, so the friend is saying every time they plan, something happens. But it's not true. So they're overestimating the frequency. Availability heuristic (E) is about how available certain memories are, making them think it's more common. Alternatively, confirmation bias (J) could be in play if they're only noticing the times when a crisis happens and ignoring other times.

But I think the key here is that they're recalling specific instances (availability) rather than considering the base rate. They might not realize that when they do manage to go, it's more common, but they're focusing on the crises they remember, making it seem like it's a regular occurrence. So E seems more likely.

Alternatively, if the friend is only looking for evidence that supports their belief and ignoring times when there was no crisis, that's confirmation bias (J). But the question says it's not really true, implying that the friend's belief is an overestimation, which might tie more to availability heuristic because they're relying on the vivid memories of crises rather than the actual frequency.

Hmm, I'm a bit torn. Both E and J could be possibilities. But the question is about the statement illustrating a concept when it's not really true. So the friend is probably overestimating how often crises occur because they remember the times when it did and forget the times when it didn't. That points more towards availability heuristic, where the ease of recalling those instances makes them think it's a common occurrence.

So I think the answer is E: availability heuristic.

The friend's statement illustrates the availability heuristic, where they overestimate the likelihood of crises occurring during vacations because they focus on and easily recall past instances of such events, making it seem more common than it actually is.

Answer: E
