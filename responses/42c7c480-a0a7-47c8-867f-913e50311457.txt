Okay, so I've got this physics problem about a cyclotron, and I need to find the magnetic induction required and the final energy the protons acquire. Then there's also a question about the error if we assume the mass remains constant. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on cyclotrons, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that a cyclotron works by using a magnetic field to bend charged particles in a circular path. The frequency of the oscillator is related to the magnetic field and the mass and charge of the particles. The formula for cyclotron frequency is f = (qB)/(2πm), right? So, if I rearrange that, B would be (2πm f)/q.

Wait, let me make sure. The cyclotron's oscillator frequency is the same as the frequency of the particle's orbit, which is f = (qB)/(2πm). So yeah, B is (2πm f)/q.

The given frequency f is 11.4 MHz, which is 11.4 x 10^6 Hz. The radius is 60 cm, but I'm not sure if that's needed for calculating B. Wait, maybe not directly because B is determined by f, m, and q. But perhaps the radius is used in the energy calculation.

Wait, another thought: the radius r in a cyclotron is given by r = (mv)/(qB). So v, the velocity, is (r q B)/(m). But I might not need v for the magnetic field part, but maybe for the kinetic energy.

So, let's calculate B first. The mass m of a proton is 1.67e-27 kg, charge q is 1.6e-19 C, and f is 11.4e6 Hz.

Plugging into B = (2π m f)/q:

B = (2 * π * 1.67e-27 kg * 11.4e6 Hz) / (1.6e-19 C).

Let me compute that step by step.

First, calculate numerator: 2 * π ≈ 6.2832.

Multiply by m: 6.2832 * 1.67e-27 ≈ 1.0508e-26.

Multiply by f: 1.0508e-26 * 11.4e6 ≈ 1.1979e-20.

Divide by q: 1.1979e-20 / 1.6e-19 ≈ 0.074865 Tesla. So approximately 0.074865 T, which is about 0.075 T. Wait, but the options are in Wb/m², which is the same as Tesla. So looking at the options, which one is around 0.075 T? Let me check the options:

Option E is 0.76 T, which is much higher. Option C: 0.75 T. Hmm, but wait, my calculation gives about 0.075 T, which is 75 mT. But looking at the options, none have 0.075. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me redo the calculation more carefully.

Calculate numerator: 2 * π is 6.2832.

Multiply by m: 6.2832 * 1.67e-27 = let's compute that. 6.2832 * 1.67 is about 10.5076. So 10.5076e-27.

Multiply by f: 10.5076e-27 * 11.4e6 = 10.5076 * 11.4 = approximately 119.788e-21, which is 1.19788e-19.

Wait, no, wait: 10.5076e-27 * 11.4e6 = 10.5076 * 11.4 = 119.788, and the exponent is e-27 +6 = e-21. So 119.788e-21 = 1.19788e-19.

Now divide by q = 1.6e-19 C:

B = 1.19788e-19 / 1.6e-19 = 0.074865 T, which is 0.074865 T, or about 0.075 T.

But wait, looking at the options, the closest is option G: 0.748 Wb/m², which is 0.748 T. But that's an order of magnitude higher. Did I make a mistake with the exponents?

Wait, perhaps I messed up the exponents. Let me recheck:

11.4e6 is 1.14e7, so let me recompute:

B = (2 * π * m * f) / q

= (2 * π * 1.67e-27 kg * 11.4e6 s^-1) / (1.6e-19 C)

Compute numerator:

2 * π ≈ 6.2832

6.2832 * 1.67e-27 ≈ 1.0508e-26

1.0508e-26 * 11.4e6 = 1.0508 * 11.4 = approx 11.979, so 11.979e-20 (since 1e-26 * 1e6 = 1e-20). So 1.1979e-19.

Wait, but 11.4e6 is actually 1.14e7, but I think I got the exponent right.

Wait, 1.0508e-26 * 11.4e6 = 1.0508 * 11.4 = 11.979, and 1e-26 * 1e6 is 1e-20. So 11.979e-20 = 1.1979e-19.

Divide by 1.6e-19:

1.1979e-19 / 1.6e-19 = (1.1979 / 1.6) = approx 0.7486. Oh wait! So that's 0.7486 T, which is about 0.7486 Wb/m². So that's approximately 0.749 T. So that's option G, which is 0.748 Wb/m².

So B is approximately 0.7486 T. So that's around 0.7486, which matches option G's 0.748. So that's the magnetic induction.

Now, the next part is finding the final energy the protons acquire. Hmm, in a cyclotron, particles are accelerated in a magnetic field, and their final kinetic energy depends on the radius and the magnetic field. I think the formula for the kinetic energy is (1/2) m v². Alternatively, since the radius r is given by r = (mv)/(qB), we can express v as (qBr)/(m), then substitute into KE.

Alternatively, I recall that the kinetic energy can be found using the relation derived from the cyclotron equations. Let me think: the maximum kinetic energy is given by K.E. = (q² B² r²)/(2m). 

Yes, because from r = (mv)/(qB), we can solve for v: v = (qBr)/(m). Then KE = (1/2) m v² = (1/2) m (q² B² r²)/(m²) ) = (q² B² r²)/(2m).

So plugging the numbers in:

q = 1.6e-19 C,

B = 0.7486 T,

r = 0.6 m,

m = 1.67e-27 kg.

So KE = ( (1.6e-19)^2 * (0.7486)^2 * (0.6)^2 ) / (2 * 1.67e-27 )

Let me compute each part step by step.

First, compute numerator parts:

(1.6e-19)^2 = (2.56e-38)

(0.7486)^2 ≈ 0.5606

(0.6)^2 = 0.36

Multiply all together:

2.56e-38 * 0.5606 ≈ 1.432e-38

1.432e-38 * 0.36 ≈ 5.155e-39

Denominator: 2 * 1.67e-27 = 3.34e-27

So KE = 5.155e-39 / 3.34e-27 ≈ 1.543e-12 J.

Wait, but looking at the options, the energies are in the 1e-11 J range. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, let me check the exponents again. Let me compute numerator again:

(1.6e-19)^2 = (1.6)^2 = 2.56, and (1e-19)^2 is 1e-38. So 2.56e-38.

B²: (0.7486)^2 ≈ 0.5606.

r²: (0.6)^2 = 0.36.

Multiply together: 2.56e-38 * 0.5606 = approx 1.432e-38.

Then 1.432e-38 * 0.36 = 5.155e-39.

Denominator: 2 * 1.67e-27 = 3.34e-27.

So 5.155e-39 / 3.34e-27 = (5.155 / 3.34) * 1e-12 ≈ 1.543 * 1e-12 ≈ 1.543e-12 J.

Wait, but the options have energies like 0.154e-11 J, which is 1.54e-12 J. So that's exactly what I got. So the KE is approximately 1.54e-12 J, which is 0.154e-11 J. So that's 0.154 ×10^-11 J.

Looking back at the options, option G says 0.154e-11 J, which matches. So far, so good.

Now, the third part: what error is made by assuming the mass of the protons remains constant? Hmm, I think this refers to relativistic effects. Because as protons gain energy and speed up, their relativistic mass increases, so ignoring that would lead to an error in the calculated kinetic energy.

The relativistic correction would be to use the actual relativistic energy, which includes gamma (γ), the Lorentz factor. The error would be the percentage difference between the classical kinetic energy (non-relativistic) and the relativistic kinetic energy.

Wait, but the question is asking what error is made by assuming mass remains constant. That is, using the non-relativistic KE formula when in reality, the mass increases, so the actual KE is higher.

Alternatively, perhaps the error is in the magnetic field calculation? Wait, no, the question is about the error in assuming mass is constant when calculating the energy. So the error would be the difference between the actual KE (relativistic) and the non-relativistic KE.

But to compute that, I think I need to find the gamma factor. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But I don't know v yet. Alternatively, maybe I can find the speed from the non-relativistic calculation and then compute gamma.

Wait, from the non-relativistic calculation, I can find v, then compute gamma, then find the relativistic KE, and compare it to the non-relativistic KE to find the percentage error.

So, from the non-relativistic approach, v = (qBr)/(m). Let me compute that.

q = 1.6e-19 C,

B = 0.7486 T,

r = 0.6 m,

m = 1.67e-27 kg.

v = (1.6e-19 * 0.7486 * 0.6) / 1.67e-27.

Compute numerator: 1.6e-19 * 0.7486 ≈ 1.1978e-19.

1.1978e-19 * 0.6 ≈ 7.1868e-20.

Denominator: 1.67e-27.

So v ≈ 7.1868e-20 / 1.67e-27 ≈ 4.3e7 m/s.

Wait, the speed of light c is about 3e8 m/s, so v is about 0.143c. So gamma would be sqrt(1/(1 - (0.143)^2)).

Compute (0.143)^2 = 0.0204.

So 1 - 0.0204 = 0.9796.

1/sqrt(0.9796) ≈ 1.005. Hmm, so gamma is approximately 1.005, which is a small increase. So the relativistic KE would be (gamma -1) mc².

Wait, the relativistic KE is (γ -1) mc², while the non-relativistic is (1/2)mv².

Let me compute both.

First, non-relativistic KE: 1.543e-12 J as before.

Relativistic KE: (γ - 1) mc².

Compute gamma: sqrt(1/(1 - v²/c²)).

v ≈ 4.3e7 m/s, c=3e8 m/s.

v²/c² = (4.3e7)^2 / (3e8)^2 = (1.849e15)/(9e16) )= approx 0.02054.

So 1 - v²/c² = 0.97946.

sqrt(0.97946) ≈ 0.9897.

So gamma = 1/0.9897 ≈ 1.0104.

So gamma is approximately 1.0104.

So relativistic KE is (1.0104 - 1) * mc² = 0.0104 * mc².

mc² for a proton is (1.67e-27 kg) * (3e8 m/s)^2 = 1.67e-27 *9e16 = 1.503e-10 J.

So relativistic KE ≈ 0.0104 * 1.503e-10 ≈ 1.563e-12 J.

Non-relativistic KE is 1.543e-12 J.

Wait, so relativistic KE is slightly higher. So the error in assuming constant mass (non-relativistic) is the difference between relativistic and non-relativistic KE divided by relativistic KE, times 100 to get the percentage error.

Error = (Relativistic KE - Non-relativistic KE) / Relativistic KE * 100.

So, error = (1.563e-12 - 1.543e-12) / 1.563e-12 * 100.

Difference is 0.02e-12, so 0.02e-12 / 1.563e-12 ≈ 0.0128 approx 1.28%.

Wait, but the options have errors around 1%. Looking back at the options, option G has 1.02% error. Hmm, my calculation gives about 1.28%, but perhaps I approximated gamma too roughly.

Wait, let me compute gamma more accurately.

v = 4.3e7 m/s.

v² = (4.3e7)^2 = 1.849e15 m²/s².

c² = 9e16 m²/s².

v²/c² = 1.849e15 / 9e16 = 0.02054.

So 1 - v²/c² = 0.97946.

sqrt(0.97946) = let me compute more accurately.

0.97946^0.5 ≈ 0.9897.

So gamma = 1 / 0.9897 ≈ 1.01043.

So relativistic KE is (gamma -1) * mc² = 0.01043 * 1.503e-10 J ≈ 1.569e-12 J.

Non-relativistic KE: 1.543e-12 J.

Difference: 1.569e-12 -1.543e-12 = 0.026e-12 J.

So error = (0.026e-12) / 1.569e-12 ≈ 0.01655, which is 1.655%.

Wait, but that's higher than the options suggest. Hmm, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, let me check the exact numbers again.

Relativistic KE: (gamma-1) mc^2.

gamma is 1.01043, so gamma-1 is 0.01043.

mc² is 1.67e-27 kg * (3e8 m/s)^2 = 1.67e-27 *9e16 = 1.503e-10 J.

So 0.01043 * 1.503e-10 = approx 1.568e-12 J.

Non-relativistic KE is 1.543e-12 J.

Difference is 1.568e-12 - 1.543e-12 = 0.025e-12 J.

So error is (0.025e-12) / 1.568e-12 ≈ 0.01594, which is approximately 1.594%.

But the options don't have an option with 1.59%. Option G is 1.02%, which is much lower. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have used a more precise value for v.

Wait, let me compute v more accurately.

v = (qBr)/(m) = (1.6e-19 C * 0.7486 T * 0.6 m) / 1.67e-27 kg.

Compute numerator:

1.6e-19 * 0.7486 = 1.6 * 0.7486 = approx 1.1978e-19 C·T·m.

Multiply by 0.6: 1.1978e-19 * 0.6 = 7.1868e-20.

Denominator: 1.67e-27 kg.

v = 7.1868e-20 / 1.67e-27 ≈ 4.3e7 m/s, as before.

But let me compute it more precisely:

7.1868e-20 / 1.67e-27 = (7.1868 / 1.67) * 1e7.

7.1868 / 1.67 ≈ 4.3.

So v ≈ 4.3e7 m/s.

v/c = 4.3e7 / 3e8 = 0.1433.

So v²/c² = (0.1433)^2 ≈ 0.02055.

1 - v²/c² = 0.97945.

sqrt(0.97945) ≈ 0.9897.

gamma = 1 / 0.9897 ≈ 1.0104.

So gamma is 1.0104, so gamma-1 is 0.0104.

So relativistic KE is 0.0104 * 1.503e-10 J ≈ 1.563e-12 J.

Non-relativistic is 1.543e-12 J.

So the error is (1.563e-12 -1.543e-12)/1.563e-12 *100 = (0.02e-12)/(1.563e-12) *100 ≈ 1.28%.

Hmm, but the options don't have this. Looking at the options, option E has 1.00% error, option G has 1.02%, option C has 1.10%, etc. So perhaps my approach is wrong.

Wait, another thought: maybe the error is calculated as the difference between relativistic and non-relativistic KE over the non-relativistic KE. So error = (Relativistic - Non-relativistic)/Non-relativistic *100.

So (1.563e-12 -1.543e-12)/1.543e-12 *100 = (0.02e-12)/(1.543e-12) *100 ≈ (0.02 /1.543)*100 ≈ 1.296%, which is about 1.3%.

But none of the options match exactly. The closest option is G: 1.02%.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the KE. Let me double-check.

Wait, the formula I used for KE in the cyclotron is (q² B² r²)/(2m). Let me confirm that.

Yes, because r = mv/(qB), so v = qBr/m.

Then KE = (1/2)mv² = (1/2)m (q² B² r²/m²) )= q² B² r²/(2m).

So that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using non-relativistic KE, but the error is the percentage difference between relativistic and non-relativistic energies.

Wait, perhaps the error is the percentage error if you didn't account for relativistic effects, so the error is how much higher the actual KE is compared to the calculated non-relativistic KE.

But according to our calculation, the relativistic KE is about 1.563e-12 J, while the non-relativistic is 1.543e-12 J. So the error is about 1.28%, but the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the KE. Let me recompute the non-relativistic KE.

q=1.6e-19 C, B=0.7486 T, r=0.6 m, m=1.67e-27 kg.

KE = (1.6e-19)^2 * (0.7486)^2 * (0.6)^2 / (2 * 1.67e-27).

Compute each term:

(1.6e-19)^2 = 2.56e-38.

(0.7486)^2 = 0.5606.

(0.6)^2 = 0.36.

Multiply together: 2.56e-38 * 0.5606 = 1.432e-38.

1.432e-38 * 0.36 = 5.155e-39.

Denominator: 2 * 1.67e-27 = 3.34e-27.

So KE = 5.155e-39 / 3.34e-27 = 1.542e-12 J.

Relativistic KE is 1.563e-12 J.

So error is (1.563e-12 - 1.542e-12) / 1.542e-12 *100 = (0.021e-12)/(1.542e-12) *100 ≈ 1.36%.

Still around 1.36%, which is not matching any option exactly. The closest option is G: 1.02%.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the error is small because the velocity is not too high, so the approximation is acceptable. Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the error differently.

Alternatively, perhaps the error is the difference between relativistic and non-relativistic KE divided by the relativistic KE, multiplied by 100. So (1.563e-12 -1.543e-12)/1.563e-12 *100 = (0.02e-12)/1.563e-12 *100 ≈ 1.28%.

Hmm, but the options don't have that. Wait, looking back at the options, option G is 0.748 Wb/m², 0.154e-11 J, 1.02% error.

Wait, maybe the error is calculated using gamma^2 -1, or perhaps another approach. Alternatively, maybe I should calculate the kinetic energy using relativistic equations and then compare.

Wait, another approach: the relativistic kinetic energy is K = (γ-1)mc².

The non-relativistic K is (1/2)mv².

The ratio (K_rel - K_non-rel)/K_non-rel * 100.

But I think I did that correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps the speed is lower, so the error is smaller. Wait, let me compute gamma more accurately.

Wait, v = 4.3e7 m/s, which is 43,000 km/s. That's about 0.143c.

So let me compute gamma more accurately.

v = 4.3e7 m/s.

v^2 = (4.3e7)^2 = 1.849e15.

c^2 = 9e16.

v^2/c^2 = 1.849e15 / 9e16 = 0.02054444...

So 1 - v²/c² = 0.979455556.

sqrt(0.979455556) = let's compute more precisely.

Let me use a calculator approximation.

We can use the Taylor expansion for sqrt(1 - x) ≈ 1 - x/2 - x²/8, for small x.

x = 1 - 0.979455556 = 0.020544444.

Wait, no: 1 - v²/c² = 0.979455556, so x = 0.979455556.

Wait, no, wait: sqrt(0.979455556) = ?

Alternatively, compute it as follows:

Let me compute sqrt(0.979455556).

We know that 0.9897^2 = 0.979455556. Because 0.9897 * 0.9897 = ?

0.98 * 0.98 = 0.9604.

0.9897^2: Let me compute (0.9897)^2 = ?

0.9897 * 0.9897:

= (0.98 + 0.0097)^2

= 0.98^2 + 2*0.98*0.0097 + 0.0097^2

= 0.9604 + 0.019208 + 0.00009409

= 0.9604 + 0.019208 = 0.979608 + 0.00009409 ≈ 0.97970209.

But wait, 0.9897^2 is approximately 0.9797, which is a bit higher than 0.979455556.

So, perhaps the exact sqrt(0.979455556) is a bit lower than 0.9897, say 0.9895.

Let me check 0.9895^2:

= (0.9895)^2 = ?

= (0.98 + 0.0095)^2

= 0.98^2 + 2*0.98*0.0095 + 0.0095^2

= 0.9604 + 0.0191 + 0.00009025

= 0.9604 + 0.0191 = 0.9795 + 0.00009025 ≈ 0.97959025.

Hmm, that's still higher than 0.979455556. So perhaps 0.9894.

Compute 0.9894^2:

= (0.98 + 0.0094)^2.

= 0.98^2 + 2*0.98*0.0094 + 0.0094^2.

= 0.9604 + 0.018904 + 0.00008836.

= 0.9604 + 0.018904 = 0.979304 + 0.00008836 ≈ 0.97939236.

That's very close to 0.979455556. So sqrt(0.979455556) ≈ 0.9894.

So gamma = 1 / 0.9894 ≈ 1.0107.

So gamma -1 ≈ 0.0107.

So relativistic KE is 0.0107 * mc².

mc² is 1.503e-10 J, so 0.0107 * 1.503e-10 ≈ 1.61e-12 J.

Non-relativistic KE is 1.543e-12 J.

Difference: 1.61e-12 -1.543e-12 = 0.067e-12.

Error: (0.067e-12)/(1.543e-12) *100 ≈ 4.34%. Wait, that can't be right because I thought v was only 0.143c.

Wait, I think I made a mistake in calculating the relativistic KE. Wait, the relativistic KE is (gamma-1)mc², which is 0.0107 * 1.503e-10 ≈ 1.61e-12 J.

Wait, but earlier I had the non-relativistic KE as 1.543e-12 J.

So the difference is 1.61e-12 -1.543e-12 = 0.067e-12 J.

So the error is 0.067e-12 / 1.543e-12 ≈ 0.0434, which is about 4.34%. That's way higher than the options suggest. But that can't be right because the velocity is only 0.143c, so relativistic effects shouldn't be that significant.

Wait, perhaps I confused the formula. The relativistic KE is (gamma-1)mc², but the non-relativistic is (1/2)mv².

Wait, let me compute both again.

Non-relativistic KE: 1.543e-12 J.

Relativistic KE: (gamma-1) mc² = (1.0107 -1) * 1.503e-10 = 0.0107 *1.503e-10 ≈ 1.608e-12 J.

So the error is (1.608e-12 -1.543e-12)/1.543e-12 *100 ≈ (0.065e-12)/(1.543e-12) ≈ 4.21%.

But that's not matching any option. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in the approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the error is calculated as the difference between the relativistic and non-relativistic energies divided by the relativistic energy.

(1.608e-12 -1.543e-12)/1.608e-12 *100 ≈ (0.065e-12)/(1.608e-12) ≈ 4.04%.

Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps I should use the exact formula for relativistic energy and compare it properly.

Alternatively, perhaps the error is in the magnetic field calculation, but earlier I thought that part was correct.

Wait, perhaps the error is negligible, and the options have rounded it. So, looking back, option G has 1.02% error, which is close to the 1.28% I calculated earlier.

But perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma. Let me try a different approach.

Using v ≈ 4.3e7 m/s, which is 0.143c.

Lorentz factor gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)).

Compute v²/c²: (4.3e7)^2 = 1.849e15, c²=9e16.

v²/c² = 1.849e15 /9e16 = 0.0205444.

1 - v²/c² = 0.9794556.

sqrt(0.9794556) ≈ 0.9897.

So gamma ≈ 1.0104.

So (gamma-1) = 0.0104.

So relativistic KE is 0.0104 * 1.503e-10 = 1.563e-12 J.

Non-relativistic: 1.543e-12 J.

Error: (1.563e-12 -1.543e-12)/1.543e-12 *100 = (0.02e-12)/(1.543e-12) ≈ 1.296%.

Hmm, but the options don't have this. The closest is option G: 1.02%.

Wait, perhaps I should check if the KE was calculated correctly. Maybe the formula for KE isn't (q² B² r²)/(2m), but something else.

Wait, let me think again. The radius r = (mv)/(qB). So v = (qBr)/(m).

Then, KE = (1/2)mv² = (1/2) m (q² B² r²)/(m²) ) = (q² B² r²)/(2m).

Yes, that's correct. So the calculation was right.

Perhaps the error is actually the percentage difference between the relativistic and non-relativistic KEs, which we found to be about 1.3%, so option G's 1.02% is the closest.

Alternatively, perhaps the error is calculated differently. Maybe the question refers to neglecting relativistic effects when calculating B, but I think B is determined by f, m, and q, so if m is considered constant, then B is accurate. The error comes into play when calculating the energy.

Wait, perhaps the error is in the assumption that the mass is constant when calculating the energy. So the energy would be overestimated because the actual mass increases, requiring a higher B for the same frequency. But no, because B is given by f, which is set, so the calculation of B doesn't depend on the energy.

Wait, perhaps the question is simpler. Maybe the error is just the percentage difference between relativistic and non-relativistic kinetic energies, which we've calculated as approximately 1.3%, but the options don't have that. So perhaps the intended answer is option G, which matches the B and energy values, and the error is approximately 1.02%, which is close to our calculation.

So, putting it all together, the magnetic induction is approximately 0.748 T, the energy is 0.154e-11 J, and the error is about 1.02%, which matches option G.

The problem involves calculating the magnetic induction required for a cyclotron to accelerate protons, determining the final energy acquired by the protons, and assessing the error introduced by assuming the proton mass remains constant. 

### Step 1: Magnetic Induction (B)
The cyclotron frequency is given by:

\[
f = \frac{qB}{2\pi m}
\]

Rearranging for \( B \):

\[
B = \frac{2\pi m f}{q}
\]

Substituting the given values:
- \( f = 11.4 \, \text{MHz} = 11.4 \times 10^6 \, \text{Hz} \),
- \( m = 1.67 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \),
- \( q = 1.6 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C} \),

\[
B = \frac{2 \cdot \pi \cdot 1.67 \times 10^{-27} \cdot 11.4 \times 10^6}{1.6 \times 10^{-19}}
\]

Calculating step-by-step:
1. \( 2 \cdot \pi \approx 6.2832 \),
2. \( 6.2832 \cdot 1.67 \times 10^{-27} \approx 1.0508 \times 10^{-26} \),
3. \( 1.0508 \times 10^{-26} \cdot 11.4 \times 10^6 \approx 1.1979 \times 10^{-20} \),
4. \( \frac{1.1979 \times 10^{-20}}{1.6 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 0.074865 \, \text{T} \).

Thus, \( B \approx 0.748 \, \text{Wb/m}^2 \), matching option G.

---

### Step 2: Final Energy (KE)
The kinetic energy acquired by the protons is given by:

\[
KE = \frac{q^2 B^2 r^2}{2m}
\]

Substituting the given values:
- \( q = 1.6 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C} \),
- \( B = 0.748 \, \text{T} \),
- \( r = 0.6 \, \text{m} \),
- \( m = 1.67 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \),

\[
KE = \frac{(1.6 \times 10^{-19})^2 \cdot (0.748)^2 \cdot (0.6)^2}{2 \cdot 1.67 \times 10^{-27}}
\]

Calculating step-by-step:
1. \( (1.6 \times 10^{-19})^2 = 2.56 \times 10^{-38} \),
2. \( (0.748)^2 \approx 0.5606 \),
3. \( (0.6)^2 = 0.36 \),
4. \( 2.56 \times 10^{-38} \cdot 0.5606 \approx 1.432 \times 10^{-38} \),
5. \( 1.432 \times 10^{-38} \cdot 0.36 \approx 5.155 \times 10^{-39} \),
6. \( \frac{5.155 \times 10^{-39}}{3.34 \times 10^{-27}} \approx 1.543 \times 10^{-12} \, \text{J} \).

Thus, \( KE \approx 0.154 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{J} \), matching option G.

---

### Step 3: Error Due to Constant Mass Assumption
The error arises from neglecting relativistic effects. The relativistic kinetic energy is:

\[
KE_{\text{rel}} = (\gamma - 1) mc^2
\]

where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \). The non-relativistic velocity \( v \) is:

\[
v = \frac{qBr}{m} = \frac{(1.6 \times 10^{-19})(0.748)(0.6)}{1.67 \times 10^{-27}} \approx 4.3 \times 10^7 \, \text{m/s}
\]

The relativistic factor \( \gamma \) is:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.143)^2}} \approx 1.0104
\]

The relativistic kinetic energy is:

\[
KE_{\text{rel}} = (1.0104 - 1) \cdot 1.503 \times 10^{-10} \approx 1.563 \times 10^{-12} \, \text{J}
\]

The error is:

\[
\text{Error} = \frac{KE_{\text{rel}} - KE_{\text{non-rel}}}{KE_{\text{non-rel}}} \cdot 100 = \frac{1.563 \times 10^{-12} - 1.543 \times 10^{-12}}{1.543 \times 10^{-12}} \cdot 100 \approx 1.28\%
\]

However, the closest option is **1.02%**, likely due to rounding or approximations in the problem setup.

---

### Final Answer
The correct option is:

**G: 0.748 Wb m⁻², 0.154 × 10⁻¹¹ J, 1.02%**
