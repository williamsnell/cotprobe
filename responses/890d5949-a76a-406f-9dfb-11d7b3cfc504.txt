Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a gorilla climbing a tree, and I need to find the work done. Hmm, let me start by recalling what I know about work in physics. Work is generally calculated as the force applied multiplied by the distance over which it's applied, right? The formula is Work = Force × Distance. 

Wait, but I also remember that work is related to energy. Specifically, when you lift something against gravity, the work done is equal to the change in gravitational potential energy. Oh right, the formula for gravitational potential energy is PE = mgh, where m is mass, g is acceleration due to gravity, and h is height. So if the gorilla is climbing the tree, the work done would be equal to the gorilla's weight (which is mass times gravity) multiplied by the height climbed. 

The question gives me the gorilla's weight as 360 pounds. Wait, but in physics, weight is a force, so that's already mass times gravity. So I don't need to multiply by g again, right? Because weight (W) = m * g. So the work done should just be the weight multiplied by the height. 

So the gorilla's weight is 360 lb, and it climbs 20 feet. So the work done, W, should be 360 lb * 20 ft. Let me calculate that: 360 times 20. 360 times 2 is 720, so 360 times 20 is 7200. So that gives me 7200 foot-pounds. 

Wait, but the question mentions the time it takes, 5 seconds. Does time matter here? I'm a bit confused because work is a scalar quantity that doesn't depend on time. Power, on the other hand, is work done per unit time. So if I were asked about power, I would need to divide the work by time to get the power. But the question is about work, not power, so I think time isn't relevant here. 

So going back, work should be 360 lb * 20 ft = 7200 ft-lb. Let me check the options again. Option F is 7200 ft-lb. That must be the correct answer.

The work done is calculated by multiplying the gorilla's weight (force) by the height climbed, which is 360 lb × 20 ft = 7200 ft-lb. Time is irrelevant for work. 

Answer: F
