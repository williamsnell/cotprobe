Question:

 The second premise in Singer's main argument is: "If it is in your power to prevent something bad from happening, without sacrificing anything nearly as important, it is wrong not to do so." Which phrase in this premise is deliberately left vague?

Okay, so I have this question about Singer's argument and I need to figure out which phrase is deliberately left vague in the second premise. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the premise is: "If it is in your power to prevent something bad from happening, without sacrificing anything nearly as important, it is wrong not to do so."

The question is asking which phrase is left vague. The options are A through J, each corresponding to a part of the premise.

Let me look at each option and see what each phrase refers to.

Option A: "it is in" – This seems to be part of "it is in your power." So maybe it's not the phrase that's left vague, but rather the entire "in your power." Hmm.

Option B: "in your power" – This phrase is pretty clear, meaning you have the ability or control. But is it left vague? Maybe not; it's a standard expression.

Option C: "prevent" – The verb here, straightforward. Nothing vague about it.

Option D: "If it is" – That's part of the conditional statement, not really a phrase that's left vague. It's just introducing the condition.

Option E: "it is wrong" – This is the conclusion, stating that not doing so is wrong. Not vague.

Option F: "not to do so" – This refers to not preventing the bad thing. It's pretty specific, so probably not vague.

Option G: "nearly as important" – This phrase is comparing the importance of what you're sacrificing. The word "nearly" makes it a bit vague because it's not precise. Instead of saying "equally important" or "as important," "nearly as important" leaves room for interpretation about how close in importance they are. So this might be the vague part.

Option H: "from happening" – This is part of "prevent something bad from happening." It's clear and specific, so probably not vague.

Option I: "something bad" – This is a general term. The term "bad" is vague because it's subjective. What one person considers bad, another might not. So "something bad" is left vague because it doesn't specify what kind of bad thing it is. That's a contender.

Option J: "without sacrificing" – This means without giving up something. It's a bit vague because it doesn't specify what's being sacrificed. So it's more about the action rather than the thing being sacrificed.

Now, I need to decide between G, I, and J. The question is about which phrase is left vague.

The premise is about preventing something bad without sacrificing something nearly as important. So "nearly as important" (G) is vague because it's not clear how close in importance they need to be. Similarly, "something bad" (I) is vague because it's subjective. "Without sacrificing" (J) is also vague because it doesn't specify what's being given up.

But the question is about the phrase that's left vague. The premise uses "something bad" as the bad thing and "nearly as important" as the comparison. So which is more deliberately left vague?

I think "nearly as important" is the key point where vagueness matters because it sets the threshold for what's acceptable to sacrifice. If it's nearly as important, does that mean almost equally important, or something less? The vagueness here allows for flexibility in applying the principle.

On the other hand, "something bad" is also vague, but it's more about the nature of the harm. However, the premise is structured to include any bad thing, so the real vagueness in the argument comes from the comparison in importance.

So, between G and I, I think G ("nearly as important") is the phrase left vague because it's about the comparison, which is crucial for the argument's application. The term "nearly" allows for a range of interpretations, making the premise more flexible but also less specific.

Wait, but the premise says "without sacrificing anything nearly as important." So the part that's vague is the comparison. So G is the phrase that's left vague.

Alternatively, could it be I? Because "something bad" is a broad term. But the question is about the phrase in the premise, and "nearly as important" is more about the level of importance, which is a key point where the argument could be applied differently based on interpretation.

So I think the answer is G.

The phrase "nearly as important" (Option G) is deliberately left vague because it introduces flexibility in determining the threshold for what is considered equally significant, allowing the principle to be applied more broadly but less precisely.

Answer: G
