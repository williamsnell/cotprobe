Okay, so I have this physics problem about projectile motion. The question is asking at what angle to the horizontal should an ideal projectile be launched so that its horizontal displacement, which is the range, is equal to its maximum vertical displacement. Hmm, I remember that projectile motion involves some equations about range and maximum height. Let me think.

First, I need to recall the formulas for the range and the maximum height of a projectile. The range R is given by (v² sin(2θ))/g, where v is the initial velocity, θ is the launch angle, and g is the acceleration due to gravity. The maximum height H is (v² sin²θ)/(2g). 

So the problem states that R equals H. That means (v² sin(2θ))/g should be equal to (v² sin²θ)/(2g). Let me write that down:

(v² sin(2θ))/g = (v² sin²θ)/(2g)

I can cancel out v² and g from both sides since they're common factors and non-zero. That leaves me with sin(2θ) = (sin²θ)/2. 

Wait, sin(2θ) is a trigonometric identity. I remember that sin(2θ) equals 2 sinθ cosθ. So substituting that in:

2 sinθ cosθ = (sin²θ)/2

Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the denominator on the right:

4 sinθ cosθ = sin²θ

Hmm, maybe I can rearrange terms. Let's bring everything to one side:

4 sinθ cosθ - sin²θ = 0

Factor out sinθ:

sinθ (4 cosθ - sinθ) = 0

So either sinθ = 0 or (4 cosθ - sinθ) = 0. 

Sinθ = 0 would imply θ = 0 or 180 degrees, but that doesn't make sense for a projectile because it wouldn't go anywhere. So we can ignore that solution.

So we focus on 4 cosθ - sinθ = 0. Let's rewrite that:

4 cosθ = sinθ

Divide both sides by cosθ (assuming cosθ ≠ 0, which it isn't except at 90 degrees, which we can check later):

4 = tanθ

So tanθ = 4. Therefore, θ = arctangent of 4, which is tan⁻¹(4). 

Looking at the options, option A is tan⁻¹(4). So that's the angle. Let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

Wait, let me check the steps again. Starting from the equation R = H, plug in the formulas, simplify, get tanθ =4. Yeah, that seems right. So the correct answer is A.

The correct answer is found by equating the range and maximum height formulas for projectile motion, leading to the angle θ = tan⁻¹(4). 

Answer: A
