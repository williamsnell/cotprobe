Okay, so I've got this question about soil texture and permeability. Let me try to work through it. The question is asking, if the permeability of subsoil is rapid, what texture is it most likely classified as? The options are A to J, but the ones listed are clayey, medium, peaty, loamy, rocky, fine, coarse, silty.

Hmm, I remember that soil texture refers to the proportions of sand, silt, and clay in the soil. Permeability is how easily water moves through the soil. So, if the soil is highly permeable, water drains quickly. That probably means the soil has larger particles, right? Because larger particles let water pass through more easily.

Wait, clay particles are really small, so clayey soils are usually impermeable because water doesn't move through them quickly. They hold water, which is why clay soils can be heavy and waterlogged. So if the permeability is rapid, it's the opposite of clayey. So A is probably not the answer.

What about peaty soil? I think peaty soils are high in organic matter, like peat. They can be quite porous but maybe not as much as others. Or wait, maybe they have a lot of spaces, but perhaps they're more fibrous and might hold water differently. I'm not too sure about peaty's permeability.

Loamy soil is usually considered good because it has a balance of sand, silt, and clay. It's often described as fertile and retains water but drains well, which is good. But is it the most permeable? Maybe not as much as sandy soils.

Rocky soil, well, if it's really rocky, it might have poor permeability because the rocks can block water movement. Or maybe if the rocks are broken down into small pieces, it could be more permeable. Not sure.

Then there's fine and coarse. Fine soil probably has smaller particles, so less permeable. Coarse would have larger particles, more space for water to move, so higher permeability. That makes sense. So coarse soil would drain quickly, meaning rapid permeability.

Silty soil is made of silt particles, which are medium-sized. Silt is usually smooth and can hold water well, maybe similar to clay but not as much. So silty might have moderate permeability.

Putting it all together: rapid permeability implies the soil is coarse because it has larger particles, allowing water to move quickly through. So the answer should be G: coarse.

The question asks about the soil texture when permeability is rapid. Permeability refers to how easily water moves through soil, which is influenced by particle size. Larger particles, such as those in coarse soil, allow water to pass through quickly, indicating high permeability. Clayey soils, with their small particles, are less permeable. Coarse soil, characterized by larger particles, fits the description of rapid permeability.
