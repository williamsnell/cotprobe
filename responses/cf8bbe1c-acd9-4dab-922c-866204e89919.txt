Okay, so I have this question about viruses and the cell theory. I'm a bit rusty on my biology, but let me think this through. The question is asking why viruses are considered an exception to the cell theory. The options are A through J, and I need to pick the right one.

First, I remember that the cell theory states that all living things are made up of cells, which are the basic units of life. Cells arise from existing cells, and all cells have certain characteristics like cell membranes and genetic material. So viruses must not fit into this theory because they don't meet one of these criteria.

Looking at the options, let's go through them one by one. 

Option A says they have evolved from ancestral protists. I think protists are a group of organisms that include things like algae and protozoa. I'm not sure if viruses evolved from protists. I thought viruses are more like remnants of genetic material that have become parasitic. So maybe A isn't the right choice.

Option B: are smaller than bacteria. Well, yes, viruses are usually much smaller than bacteria. But does that make them an exception to cell theory? I don't think so. Because size isn't the main issue here; it's about whether they can function independently as living organisms. So B might not be the correct answer.

Option C: are not independent organisms. This rings a bell. I remember that viruses can't reproduce or carry out life functions on their own. They need a host cell to do that. So they aren't considered independent organisms, which means they don't fit the cell theory because the theory says all life comes from cells. So C seems like a strong candidate.

Option D: are immune to most antiviral drugs. That's not true. Viruses are generally susceptible to antiviral drugs, and I'm not sure how this relates to the cell theory. So D probably isn't the right answer.

Option E: can reproduce without a host cell. No, viruses can't reproduce without a host. They need a host cell to replicate. So E is incorrect.

Option F: can photosynthesize. I don't think any virus can photosynthesize. Maybe some have the genes for it, but they don't use them. So F is probably wrong.

Option G: have only a few genes. Some viruses have a small number of genes, but that's more about their genetic makeup, not their status as living organisms. So G doesn't explain why they're an exception to the cell theory.

Option H: move about via their tails. Wait, I think some bacteria have tails (flagella) to move, but viruses don't have tails. They're usually just particles, so H is incorrect.

Option I: can be killed by antibiotics. Well, antibiotics target bacteria, not viruses. But this doesn't relate to the cell theory exception. So I is not the right choice.

Option J: do not contain both DNA and RNA. That's true for some viruses, like DNA viruses or RNA viruses, but not all. For example, HIV has RNA, and others have DNA. But does this explain why they're an exception to cell theory? I don't think so because it's more about their genetic content, not their ability to function as living organisms independently.

Putting it all together, the key reason viruses don't fit the cell theory is that they aren't independent organisms. They can't survive or reproduce on their own; they need a host cell. So the correct answer should be option C.

The correct answer is C: are not independent organisms.
