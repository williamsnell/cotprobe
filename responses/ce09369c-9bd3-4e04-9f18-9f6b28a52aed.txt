Question:

When one uses a time-series design to evaluate a program, fluctuation in the outcome slope can be accounted for by various alternative hypotheses. According to Campbell and Stanley, the most probable alternative is that

Options:

A: the outcome measure was not sensitive enough
B: a simultaneous event produced the fluctuation
C: the participants did not understand the program
D: the data was not analyzed correctly
E: the program was not implemented correctly
F: the fluctuation was due to random chance
G: participants dropped out of the group, reducing the size of the sample
H: aging effects were unduly influential
I: testâ€”retest reliability is inadequate
J: the time-series design was flawed

Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about time-series designs in program evaluation, specifically referring to Campbell and Stanley's work. Let me think through this step by step.

The question is asking about what alternative hypothesis is most probable when there's fluctuation in the outcome slope using a time-series design. The options are labeled A through J, and I need to pick the correct one.

First, I remember that time-series designs involve collecting data on the outcome variable over time, often before and after a program is implemented. This helps in identifying trends and patterns. Campbell and Stanley are known for their work on quasi-experimental designs, so their perspective is likely about potential threats to validity in such designs.

The key here is fluctuation in the outcome slope. So, the outcome isn't showing a consistent change but has ups and downs. The question is about the most probable alternative hypothesis for why this fluctuation occurs.

Looking at the options:

A: Outcome measure not sensitive enough. If the measure isn't sensitive, it might not detect changes, but that would probably lead to a flat or no trend, not fluctuation. So maybe not A.

B: Simultaneous event. That makes sense because external events happening at the same time as data collection could cause unexpected fluctuations. For example, a policy change or a natural disaster might affect the outcome variable.

C: Participants didn't understand the program. That could affect the outcome, but it's more about implementation issues rather than fluctuation over time. It might cause a steady effect, not fluctuations.

D: Data analysis incorrect. That's more about research process errors. While possible, it's not a common alternative hypothesis in this context.

E: Program not implemented correctly. Similar to C, it's about implementation but might lead to a downward trend or no change, not necessarily fluctuations.

F: Random chance. It's a possibility, but in the context of program evaluation, they usually look for more plausible explanations than just random variation.

G: Participants dropping out. This could affect the sample size and introduce bias, but again, it's more about the composition of the sample rather than causing fluctuations in the slope.

H: Aging effects. This refers to changes due to the passage of time, like maturation. It's a possible confounding factor, but I'm not sure if it's the most probable when considering time-series designs.

I: Test-retest reliability. If the measure isn't reliable, you might see variability, but it's more about the consistency of the measure over time rather than fluctuation in the outcome slope.

J: Time-series design flawed. This is a general criticism, but the question is about the most probable alternative, so it's probably more specific than this.

Now, thinking about Campbell and Stanley's work, in their book "Experimental and Quasi-Experimental Designs for Evaluating Educational Programs," they discuss various threats to internal validity, including history, maturation, testing, instrumentation, selection, and regression. The history threat refers to events external to the program that occur between the pretest and posttest, which can affect the outcome. So, a simultaneous event (option B) would fall under the history threat, making it a likely answer.

Another angle: the question specifies "fluctuation in the outcome slope," meaning the trend isn't consistent. A simultaneous event that occurs at different times could cause such fluctuations. For example, if the program is running, and then there's an external event like an economic downturn, it could cause a dip, then recover if the economy improves, leading to fluctuations.

So, putting it all together, the most probable alternative hypothesis according to Campbell and Stanley would be that a simultaneous event produced the fluctuation. That points to option B.

The most probable alternative hypothesis for fluctuation in the outcome slope when using a time-series design, according to Campbell and Stanley, is that a simultaneous event produced the fluctuation. This aligns with the "history threat" in quasi-experimental designs, where external events can impact the outcome variable.

Answer: B
