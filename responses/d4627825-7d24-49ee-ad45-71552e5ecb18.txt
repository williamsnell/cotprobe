Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the relationship between genetic and environmental factors in intelligence. I remember from my classes that intelligence isn't just one thing; it's probably a mix of different factors. Let me think about what I've learned before.

I think intelligence has a hereditary component. Like, if your parents are smart, you might be too. That's genetics. But I also remember reading that the environment plays a role too. For example, growing up in a stimulating environment with lots of books and educational toys can help a child develop their intelligence. So it's not just genes or just the environment.

Wait, I think there's something called the nature versus nurture debate. Nature being the genetic side, and nurture being the environmental. From what I understand, both are important. Some studies suggest that genetics contribute a significant portion, maybe around 50-80%, but the rest comes from the environment. But I'm not sure about the exact percentages.

Looking at the options, option F says intelligence is determined by both genetic and environmental factors. That sounds right because both contribute. Option H says it's a complex interplay between genetics and life experiences, with environmental factors being less significant. Hmm, I'm not sure if environmental factors are less significant. I thought they were more about the development part, especially in early life.

Option J mentions a balance of genetic, environmental, and random chance. That could make sense because sometimes random events can influence intelligence, but I'm not sure if that's a widely accepted view. I don't recall that being a major point in what I've studied.

Option G says intelligence is determined by social factors with genetics playing a secondary role. That doesn't sound right. I think genetics have a more primary role, at least in the foundational aspects.

Option I talks about educational factors being primary. But I think education is part of the environmental factors, so it's not the main determinant on its own.

So narrowing down, F and H seem the most plausible. F is straightforward: both factors determine intelligence. H suggests a complex interplay but downplays environmental significance. I'm not sure if environmental factors are less significant. From what I know, both are important but maybe genetics have a bigger influence, especially as people age. Or maybe the environment is crucial for reaching one's potential.

Wait, I think the heritability of intelligence increases as people get older. Like, in younger ages, the environment has a bigger impact, but as you mature, genetics become more influential. So it's a mix, and both play significant roles throughout life, but their importance might vary at different stages.

So looking back, option F says both factors determine intelligence, which is a general statement that fits. Option J adds random chance, which I'm not certain about. I think the main factors are genetics and environment, not so much random chance.

Therefore, I think the correct answer is F.

The relationship between genetic and environmental factors in intelligence is best described as both contributing to its development. Intelligence is influenced by genetics, which provide a foundational role, and environmental factors, which play a significant role in shaping and enhancing it throughout life. This interplay is complex and dynamic, with both factors interacting in ways that are not solely determined by either. 

Answer: F
