Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about Robertsonian translocation. Hmm, I remember that Robertsonian translocation is a type of chromosomal rearrangement. Let me think... Robertsonian translocation involves the fusion of two chromosomes, right? Specifically, it's when two acrocentric chromosomes lose their short arms and join together at their centromeres. 

Wait, acrocentric chromosomes have their centromeres near one end, so their short arms are on one side and the long arms on the other. When two of these lose their short arms and fuse, the result is a single chromosome with a single centromere. So the fusion happens where the centromeres were. 

Looking at the options, G is centromeres. That makes sense because the fusion would occur at the centromeric regions of the two chromosomes. Let me make sure I'm not mixing this up with other types of translocations. Like, reciprocal translocation is between non-homologous regions, but Robertsonian is specific to the fusion of two chromosomes losing their short arms. 

So the question is about where the fusion occurs. The ends of the long arms (A) don't seem right because that would be more about the arms fusing, but Robertsonian is about centromere fusion. Telomeres (F) are the ends of chromosomes, but that's not where the fusion happens. Centromeres (G) are definitely the spot where the two chromosomes join in this case. 

I think the answer must be G. Centromeres.

The Robertsonian translocation occurs when two acrocentric chromosomes lose their short arms and fuse at their centromeres. This results in a single chromosome with a single centromere. The fusion specifically takes place at the centromeric regions of the two chromosomes involved.
