Question:

A partnership conveyed a general warranty deed representing a vacant parcel of land to the purchaser. In the deed, the grantee and her assigns were required by covenant to share proportionately in the paving of a road that abutted the property. The grantee conveyed the property to a married couple by special warranty deed that did not contain any of the conditions of the covenant regarding paving the new road. The buyers did not have an attorney and did not do a title search. When the road was completed, the married couple buyers refused to pay the share that was demanded of them. The original sellers of the parcel sued the couple in an equity claim without a jury. The judge ruled that the couple had to pay their share of the paving. On appeal, will the appellate court affirm the trial judge's order?

Options:

A: No, because the couple were not aware of the covenant due to not having a lawyer and not conducting a title search.
B: No, because the general warranty of the original sellers did not apply beyond the first purchaser.
C: Yes, because a landowner is in any event responsible for her share of improvements to any abutting private roads.
D: Yes, this is a covenant running with the land because it was intended to apply to the first purchaser's heirs and "assigns".
E: Yes, because the covenant was part of the original agreement and therefore applies to all subsequent owners.
F: Yes, because the couple should have conducted a title search to understand the obligations associated with the property.
G: No, because the sellers did not explicitly communicate the covenant to the couple.
H: Yes, because the couple should have hired an attorney to understand the obligations of the property.
I: No, because the special warranty deed given to the couple did not include any obligations related to the paving of the road.
J: No, because the paving requirement had to be placed in the deed to the married couple and it was not.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this legal question about property deeds and covenants. Let me start by breaking down the problem step by step.

First, the scenario: A partnership conveyed a general warranty deed to a purchaser. The deed included a covenant requiring the grantee and her assigns to share in paving a road that abutted the property. Then, the grantee (who is the original purchaser) conveyed the property to a married couple using a special warranty deed. Importantly, this special warranty deed didn't include any of the conditions about the paving covenant. The buyers didn't have a lawyer and didn't do a title search. When the road was paved, the couple refused to pay their share. The original sellers sued them in equity without a jury, and the judge ruled the couple had to pay. Now, the question is whether the appellate court will affirm that decision.

I need to determine which of the options (A to J) is correct. Let me think about the key points here: types of deeds, covenants, and whether these covenants run with the land.

So, a general warranty deed typically includes covenants that run with the land. These covenants promise that the grantor (seller) will defend the title against all claims and that the grantee will not be disturbed in their ownership. Importantly, these covenants can bind future assigns (subsequent owners) unless certain conditions are met.

In this case, the original deed had a covenant that the grantee and her assigns must share in paving the road. Assigns would include any future owners, so that covenant would normally run with the land. But then, the grantee conveyed the property to the couple using a special warranty deed, which only warrants against defects that arose during the grantor's ownership. It doesn't include the same covenants as a general warranty deed. Also, the special warranty deed didn't include the paving covenant, so the couple didn't have that obligation under their deed.

Wait, but the original covenant was in the first deed. So, the question is whether that covenant runs with the land to subsequent owners, even if the subsequent deed (special warranty) doesn't mention it.

I remember that covenants can run with the land if they meet certain criteria. For a covenant to run with the land, it must typically touch and concern the land, be intended to run, and the original parties must have intended it to benefit the land and burden the land in a way that affects subsequent owners.

In this case, the paving covenant does touch and concern the land because it's about the use and improvement of the property. The original deed included the covenant, so the original seller's general warranty would cover that. But when the property is conveyed via a special warranty deed, does that covenant continue?

Wait, the special warranty deed only warrants against defects that arose during the grantor's ownership. It doesn't include the covenants from a general warranty deed. So, the covenant to share in paving the road was in the original general warranty deed, but when the property was conveyed to the couple, the deed didn't include that covenant. So, the couple didn't have any obligation under their deed regarding the paving.

But wait, the original covenant was in the first deed. So, the original sellers (the partnership) gave a general warranty deed to the grantee, which included the covenant. The grantee then gave a special warranty deed to the couple, which didn't include that covenant. So, does the covenant run with the land to the couple?

I think for a covenant to run with the land, it needs to meet certain criteria, like being in a deed, touching and concerning the land, and being intended to run. The original covenant was in the first deed, so it burdened the land. But when the property was conveyed again, if the new deed doesn't include it, does the covenant still apply?

Wait, in real covenants, once created, they can bind successors unless certain conditions are met. So, even if the second deed doesn't mention it, the covenant may still apply if it's intended to run with the land.

But wait, the original covenant was in the first deed, so the original sellers (partnership) are the ones who made that covenant with the first grantee. So, the covenant would be a burden on the land, and the subsequent owners (the couple) would be subject to that covenant if it runs with the land.

But the couple's deed was a special warranty deed, which doesn't include those covenants. So, the couple didn't take on the covenant in their deed. But does the covenant still apply because it's a covenant running with the land?

I think that if a covenant is properly created and intended to run, it can bind subsequent owners even if they get a special warranty deed. So, the fact that the special warranty deed didn't include the covenant doesn't necessarily mean it doesn't apply. The covenant runs with the land, so the burden is on the land, not just on the grantee.

But wait, in some jurisdictions, the burden of a covenant may require that it's expressed to run with the land. So, the covenant needs to be in the deed and state that it's for the benefit of the assigns or successors.

Looking at the options, option D says yes because the covenant was intended to apply to the first purchaser's heirs and assigns. So, that suggests that the covenant runs with the land, meaning the couple is still bound.

Option I says no because the special warranty deed didn't include the obligations. But if the covenant runs with the land, the deed not including it doesn't matter because the covenant is a burden on the land, not just a covenant between the parties.

But wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The original grantee (the first purchaser) had the covenant in the general warranty deed. When she conveyed to the couple, she used a special warranty deed that didn't include the covenant. So, the couple didn't take on that covenant in their deed.

But real covenants, once created, can bind subsequent owners. So, even if the couple's deed doesn't mention it, the covenant is still enforceable against them if it's a real covenant that runs with the land.

Wait, but in this case, the covenant was in the original deed from the partnership to the grantee. So, the partnership is the one who made the covenant. When the grantee conveyed to the couple, the covenant would only run if it was intended to burden the land, which it was, because it's about the use of the land (paving the road). So, the couple would be subject to the covenant.

But the couple didn't have an attorney and didn't do a title search. So, they didn't know about the covenant. But knowledge isn't a defense for real covenants because they run with the land. Even if you don't know, you're still bound.

So, the couple's lack of knowledge doesn't matter. The covenant is enforceable against them because it runs with the land. Therefore, the trial court was correct in ordering them to pay, and the appellate court would affirm.

Looking at the options again:

Option D: Yes, because the covenant was intended to apply to the first purchaser's heirs and assigns. That seems correct because the covenant was in the original deed, which included assigns. So, the covenant runs with the land.

Option E: Yes, because the covenant was part of the original agreement and applies to all subsequent owners. That also makes sense because covenants can run with the land.

Option I: No, because the special warranty deed didn't include the covenant. But as I thought earlier, the deed not including it doesn't matter if the covenant runs with the land.

So, options D and E seem plausible.

Wait, but the original deed was a general warranty deed, which includes covenants that run with the land. The special warranty deed doesn't include covenants, but the covenant in the general warranty deed may still apply.

So, the couple is bound by the covenant because it's a real covenant that runs with the land, regardless of what's in their deed. Therefore, the appellate court would affirm the trial judge's order.

Looking at the options, the correct answer would be either D or E.

Option D says it's because the covenant was intended to apply to the first purchaser's heirs and assigns. That's correct because the original covenant was in the deed to the first grantee, and the covenant was for the grantee and her assigns.

Option E says it's because the covenant was part of the original agreement and applies to all subsequent owners. That's also correct.

Wait, which one is more accurate? In real covenants, it's about whether the covenant touches and concerns the land, was intended to run, and notice isn't necessary. Here, the covenant was in the original deed, so it's a real covenant. The couple, as subsequent owners, are subject to it.

So, the appellate court would affirm, meaning the answer is either D, E, or another yes option.

Looking at the options, D and E are both yes. Let me see the wording.

Option D: Yes, because the covenant was intended to apply to the first purchaser's heirs and "assigns".

Option E: Yes, because the covenant was part of the original agreement and therefore applies to all subsequent owners.

I think both points are valid, but the key is that the covenant was intended to run with the land. So, D is more specific about the intention regarding assigns, which is a key element for running covenants.

So, the correct answer would be D.

The key issue revolves around whether the covenant in the original general warranty deed runs with the land to the subsequent owners despite the special warranty deed lacking this covenant. A covenant running with the land requires that it touches and concerns the land, is intended to run, and burdens the land. The original covenant met these criteria, making it enforceable against the couple. Their lack of knowledge or a title search does not negate the covenant's enforceability. Therefore, the appellate court will affirm the trial judge's order.
