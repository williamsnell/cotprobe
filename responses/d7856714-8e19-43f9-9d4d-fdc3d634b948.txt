Okay, so I've got this problem about baseball park sections and figuring out how many people can sit in total. Let me break it down step by step.

First, there are three sections: red, blue, and green. I need to find the number of people each can seat and then add them up.

The red section seats 200 people. That's straightforward. So red is 200.

Next, the blue section seats 20 fewer people than the red section. Hmm, so if red is 200, then blue would be 200 minus 20. Let me do that math: 200 - 20 equals 180. So blue is 180 seats.

Now the green section is 2 times as many people as the blue section. Since blue is 180, green would be 2 multiplied by 180. Let me calculate that: 180 * 2 is 360. So green seats 360 people.

Now I need to add up all three sections to get the total. Red is 200, blue is 180, and green is 360. Adding them together: 200 + 180 is 380, and then 380 + 360 equals 740. So the total number of people is 740.

Looking at the options, E is 740. So that should be the correct answer.

The red section has 200 seats. The blue section has 200 - 20 = 180 seats. The green section has 2 * 180 = 360 seats. Adding them together: 200 + 180 + 360 = 740.

Answer: E
