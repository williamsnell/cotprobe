The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

This question refers to the following information.
"The question, therefore, should be quickly settled, whether free colored persons, born and naturalized in this country, are not American citizens, and justly entitled to all the rights, privileges and immunities of citizens of the several states; and whether the Constitution of the United States makes or authorizes any invidious distinction with regard to the color or condition of free inhabitants.
"For myself, I have not the shadow of doubt on the subject. I believe that the rights of the free colored persons need only to be vindicated before the U.S. Supreme Court, to be obtained; that no prejudice or sophistry . . . can prevent their acknowledgement . . . and that the present laws, affecting your condition, are clearly unconstitutional. The fact that you have been treated, by common consent and common usage, as aliens and brutes, is not proof that such treatment is legal, but only shows the strength, the bitterness, and the blindness of prejudice."
—William Lloyd Garrison, "To the Free People of Color of the United States," The Liberator, January 15, 1831

Alright, let's try to figure out the right answer here. The question is about William Lloyd Garrison's argument in 1831 regarding the citizenship rights of free African Americans. He believed that these individuals were U.S. citizens and that their rights were being denied unconstitutionally. He was advocating for their rights to be recognized by the Supreme Court.

The question asks which Supreme Court decision contradicted his argument. So, I need to find a case where the Court ruled against the citizenship rights of African Americans, particularly in the context of whether they were considered citizens or not.

Looking at the options:

A: United States v. Nixon (1974) – This was about executive privilege and the Watergate scandal. Not related to citizenship rights.

B: Miranda v. Arizona (1966) – This is about the Miranda rights, dealing with police procedures during arrests. Not related to citizenship.

C: Gideon v. Wainwright (1963) – This decision established the right to legal counsel for indigent defendants in state trials. Again, not about citizenship.

D: Marbury v. Madison (1803) – This was about judicial review, establishing the Court's authority to overturn laws. Not relevant here.

E: Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka (1954) – This landmark case overturned segregation in schools, but it was much later and about segregation, not citizenship.

F: Ex parte Milligan (1866) – This involved a Confederate sympathizer during the Civil War, dealing with habeas corpus and military trials. Not directly about citizenship.

G: Roe v. Wade (1973) – Concerns abortion rights. Not related.

H: Plessy v. Ferguson (1896) – This upheld the "separate but equal" doctrine, allowing racial segregation. It's about segregation but also about the rights of African Americans. However, it came after the Dred Scott decision.

I: McCulloch v. Maryland (1819) – This was about states' rights and the supremacy of federal laws. Not related to citizenship.

J: Dred Scott v. Sanford (1857) – This case ruled that African Americans, whether free or enslaved, were not citizens of the United States and couldn't bring cases to federal court. This directly contradicts Garrison's argument because he believed free blacks were citizens with rights, but the Court in Dred Scott denied that.

So, the correct answer should be J, Dred Scott v. Sanford (1857), as it directly contradicted Garrison's argument by denying citizenship rights to African Americans.

The argument by William Lloyd Garrison was later contradicted by the Supreme Court in *Dred Scott v. Sanford (1857)*, which ruled that African Americans were not citizens and could not claim rights under the Constitution.

Answer: J
