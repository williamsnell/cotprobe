Okay, so I have this question about estimating the PE ratio for a firm, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see, the PE ratio stands for Price-to-Earnings ratio, right? It's a valuation metric that compares a company's stock price to its earnings per share. But how do I estimate it here?

The question gives a bunch of financial details, so I need to parse through each one. Let me list out the given information:

- Length of high growth: five years.
- Growth rate in first five years: 25%.
- Payout ratio in first five years: 20%.
- Growth rate after five years: 8%.
- Payout ratio after five years: 50%.
- Beta: 1.0.
- Risk-free rate: T-bond rate = 6%.
- Cost of equity: 6% + 1*(5.5%) = 11.5%. Wait, that seems off. Oh, maybe it's using the CAPM formula. Because Cost of Equity (Re) = Risk-free rate (Rf) + Beta*(Market risk premium). Here, Beta is 1.0, and the risk premium is 5.5%, so Re = 6% + 5.5% = 11.5%. Yep, that makes sense.

Alright, so to find the PE ratio, I think I need to calculate the present value of the firm's future earnings and then determine the price based on that. The PE ratio is Price divided by Earnings per Share (EPS). But I might need to compute the perpetuity value or something like that.

I remember that for growth stocks, especially those with a high growth phase followed by stable growth, the valuation often uses the Gordon Growth Model (also known as the perpetual growth model) for the terminal value after the high-growth period. So the approach is to calculate the free cash flows during the high growth years, discount them, and then add the terminal value.

Wait, but since the question is about the PE ratio, maybe I should focus on the earnings per share. Let me think. The PE ratio is Price per Share divided by Earnings per Share. So I need to find the price per share, which is based on the present value of all future earnings, and the current EPS.

But how do I model this? I think I can use a two-stage dividend discount model because the growth rate changes after five years. Alternatively, since the question is about PE ratio, perhaps I can model the perpetuity growth after the five years and calculate the required value.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Calculate the expected dividend for each of the next five years.
2. Calculate the terminal value at the end of year five.
3. Discount all these cash flows (dividends and terminal value) back to the present using the cost of equity.
4. The sum of these present values should give the intrinsic value of the stock, which relates to the price.
5. Then, the PE ratio would be Price per Share divided by EPS. But wait, what's the EPS? The question gives payout ratios, so I might need to compute dividends and then relate them to EPS.

Wait, perhaps I'm complicating it. The PE ratio can also be estimated using the Gordon Growth Model formula. The formula is PE = (Growth rate + Return) / (Return - Growth rate), but I'm not sure if that's applicable here because there are two growth phases.

Alternatively, maybe I should calculate the present value of all future dividends and then relate that to the current EPS to find the PE ratio. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try breaking it down.

First, I think I need to calculate the intrinsic value of the stock using the dividend discount model. Since the growth changes after five years, it's a two-stage model.

Let me denote:
- D0: current dividend
- g1: growth rate during high growth (25%)
- g2: growth rate after high growth (8%)
- payout ratio during high growth (20%)
- payout ratio after high growth (50%)

Wait, but the payout ratio affects the dividends. So, the dividends during the first five years are based on the payout ratio, and after that, they're based on the new payout ratio.

But I don't have the current EPS or current dividend. Hmm. Maybe I can assume that the current dividend is D0, and then model the future dividends.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model the stock price as the present value of all future dividends. Let me try that.

The formula for the two-stage model is:

Stock Price (P0) = D1/(1+Re) + D2/(1+Re)^2 + ... + D5/(1+Re)^5 + Terminal Value/(1+Re)^5

Where Re is the cost of equity (11.5%).

But to calculate D1, D2, etc., I need the current dividend. Wait, but the question doesn't provide D0 or the current EPS. Hmm. Maybe I can express everything in terms of EPS.

Wait, the payout ratio is the percentage of earnings paid out as dividends. So, if the payout ratio is 20% in the first five years, then D1 = 0.20 * EPS1. Similarly, after five years, the payout ratio is 50%, so D6 = 0.50 * EPS6.

But I don't know the current EPS. Maybe I can assume that the initial EPS is 1 for simplicity? Or perhaps I can find the relationship without knowing the exact EPS.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the present value of all future earnings and then relate it to the current earnings to get the PE ratio. Let me think.

Wait, the PE ratio is Price/Current EPS. So if I can find the present value of all future earnings, which would be the Price, then PE = Price / Current EPS.

But without knowing the current EPS, I can't compute that directly. Wait, maybe I can express the present value of future earnings in terms of the current EPS.

Let me try this approach. Let's denote the current EPS as EPS0.

Then, the earnings for the next five years are:
EPS1 = EPS0 * (1 + 25%)
EPS2 = EPS1 * 1.25 = EPS0 * 1.25^2
...
EPS5 = EPS0 * 1.25^5

After year 5, the growth rate drops to 8%, so EPS6 = EPS5 * 1.08, and so on.

The present value of all these earnings would be the sum of each EPS divided by (1 + Re)^t for t=1 to infinity, but we can model the terminal value at year 5.

Wait, but the terminal value in the two-stage model is calculated as (EPS6 * (1 + g2)) / (Re - g2). Or is it (EPS6) * (1 + g2) / (Re - g2). Wait, no, the terminal value is the value of all earnings from year 6 onwards, which can be calculated as (EPS6 / (Re - g2)).

Wait, actually, the terminal value (TV) is calculated as the value of the perpetuity starting from year 6, which is TV = (EPS6) / (Re - g2). Because after year 5, the earnings grow at a constant rate g2, so the value is EPS6 / (Re - g2).

But wait, no, the Gordon Growth Model formula is P = E / (Re - g), where E is the earnings in the perpetuity period. So in this case, the terminal value at year 5 would be EPS6 / (Re - g2). But we have to discount that back to year 0.

So, putting it all together:

Price (P0) = sum_{t=1 to 5} (EPS_t / (1 + Re)^t) + (EPS6 / (Re - g2)) / (1 + Re)^5

But since we're interested in the PE ratio, which is P0 / EPS0, we can express everything in terms of EPS0.

Let me write each term:

EPS1 = EPS0 * 1.25
EPS2 = EPS0 * 1.25^2
...
EPS5 = EPS0 * 1.25^5
EPS6 = EPS0 * 1.25^5 * 1.08 = EPS0 * 1.25^5 * 1.08

So, the present value of each EPS from year 1 to 5 is:

Sum = EPS0 * [1.25/(1.115) + 1.25^2/(1.115)^2 + 1.25^3/(1.115)^3 + 1.25^4/(1.115)^4 + 1.25^5/(1.115)^5]

And the terminal value is:

TV = (EPS0 * 1.25^5 * 1.08) / (0.115 - 0.08) = (EPS0 * 1.25^5 * 1.08) / 0.035

Then, the present value of TV is:

TV PV = TV / (1.115)^5 = [EPS0 * 1.25^5 * 1.08 / 0.035] / (1.115)^5

So, Price P0 is the sum of the present values of the first five EPS and the PV of TV.

Then, PE ratio = P0 / EPS0 = [Sum of (1.25^t / 1.115^t) for t=1 to 5] + [ (1.25^5 * 1.08) / (0.035 * 1.115^5) ) ] 

Since EPS0 cancels out.

Now, let's compute each part step by step.

First, compute the sum for t=1 to 5 of (1.25/1.115)^t.

Let me calculate each term:

t=1: 1.25 / 1.115 ≈ 1.1211
t=2: (1.25/1.115)^2 ≈ (1.1211)^2 ≈ 1.2568
t=3: (1.25/1.115)^3 ≈ 1.1211^3 ≈ 1.4049
t=4: (1.25/1.115)^4 ≈ 1.1211^4 ≈ 1.5753
t=5: (1.25/1.115)^5 ≈ 1.1211^5 ≈ 1.7586

Sum these up: 1.1211 + 1.2568 + 1.4049 + 1.5753 + 1.7586 ≈ let's add them:

1.1211 + 1.2568 = 2.3779
2.3779 + 1.4049 = 3.7828
3.7828 + 1.5753 = 5.3581
5.3581 + 1.7586 ≈ 7.1167

So the sum of the first part is approximately 7.1167.

Next, compute the terminal value part:

(1.25^5 * 1.08) / (0.035 * 1.115^5)

First, compute 1.25^5:

1.25^1 =1.25
^2=1.5625
^3=1.9531
^4=2.4414
^5=3.0518

So 1.25^5 ≈ 3.0518

Multiply by 1.08: 3.0518 * 1.08 ≈ 3.2972

Now, compute 1.115^5:

1.115^1 =1.115
^2=1.115*1.115≈1.2432
^3≈1.2432*1.115≈1.3840
^4≈1.3840*1.115≈1.5400
^5≈1.5400*1.115≈1.7184

So 1.115^5 ≈1.7184

Then, denominator: 0.035 * 1.7184 ≈0.060144

So the terminal value part is 3.2972 / 0.060144 ≈54.82

Wait, but that's the terminal value at year 5. We need to discount it back to year 0, so we divide by 1.115^5, which we already have as 1.7184.

Wait, no. Wait, the formula is TV = (EPS6)/(Re - g2). Then, the present value is TV / (1.115)^5.

But in the expression above, we have:

(1.25^5 *1.08)/(0.035 *1.115^5) = (3.2972)/(0.060144) ≈54.82

Wait, no. Let me re-express. The TV is (EPS6)/(Re - g2) = (EPS0 *1.25^5 *1.08)/(0.115 - 0.08) = (EPS0 *3.0518 *1.08)/(0.035) = EPS0 *3.2972 / 0.035 = EPS0 *94.2057

Wait, that can't be right because 3.2972 / 0.035 is approximately 94.2057. Then, the present value is TV / (1.115)^5 = (EPS0 *94.2057)/1.7184 ≈EPS0 *54.82

So the terminal value's present value is approximately 54.82 * EPS0.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me re-do this step.

TV at year 5 is (EPS6)/(Re - g2) = (EPS0 *1.25^5 *1.08) / (0.115 - 0.08) = (EPS0 *3.0518 *1.08) /0.035 ≈ (EPS0 *3.2972)/0.035 ≈EPS0 *94.2057

Then, the present value of TV is 94.2057 / (1.115)^5 ≈94.2057 /1.7184≈54.82

So, the present value of the terminal value is approximately 54.82 * EPS0.

Wait, no, because TV is at year 5, so we discount it back to present: 94.2057 / (1.115)^5 ≈54.82. So that's 54.82 * EPS0.

So now, the total P0 is the sum of the first five years' present values plus the PV of TV:

P0 = (7.1167 * EPS0) + (54.82 * EPS0) = (7.1167 + 54.82) * EPS0 ≈61.9367 * EPS0

Therefore, PE ratio = P0 / EPS0 ≈61.9367.

Wait, but that's not one of the options. The options are up to about 35.60. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Hmm, maybe I messed up the formula. Let me double-check.

Wait, perhaps I confused dividends with earnings. Because the PE ratio is based on earnings, not dividends. Alternatively, maybe I should model the stock price based on dividends instead of earnings. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the dividend discount model (DDM) instead of the earnings approach. Let me try that.

In the DDM, the stock price is the present value of all future dividends. So, let's model that.

Given:

- Payout ratio during high growth (first five years) is 20%. So, D1 = 0.20 * EPS1, D2=0.20*EPS2, etc.

- After five years, payout ratio is 50%, so D6=0.50 * EPS6.

But without knowing EPS0, I can't compute the actual dividends. So perhaps I can express everything in terms of D0.

Wait, but payout ratio is D0 / EPS0. So if the payout ratio is 20% in the first five years, then D1 = 0.20 * EPS1. But EPS1 = EPS0 *1.25. So D1 = 0.20 * EPS0 *1.25 = D0 * (1.25) because D0 =0.20 * EPS0.

Wait, no. Wait, D0 = payout ratio * EPS0 = 0.20 * EPS0.

So D1 = 0.20 * EPS1 = 0.20 * (EPS0 *1.25) = D0 *1.25.

Similarly, D2 = D0*(1.25)^2, etc.

After five years, the payout ratio becomes 50%, so D6 =0.50 * EPS6 =0.50*(EPS0 *1.25^5 *1.08) = D0 * (1.25^5 *1.08 /0.20).

Wait, because D0 =0.20 * EPS0 → EPS0 = D0 /0.20.

So D6 =0.50 * (D0/0.20) *1.25^5 *1.08.

Simplify:

D6 = D0 * (0.50 /0.20) *1.25^5 *1.08 = D0 *2.5 *3.0518 *1.08 ≈ D0 *2.5 *3.2972 ≈D0 *8.243

Now, the stock price is the present value of all dividends:

P0 = D1/(1.115) + D2/(1.115)^2 + D3/(1.115)^3 + D4/(1.115)^4 + D5/(1.115)^5 + PV of D6 onwards.

Where D1 to D5 are D0 *1.25^t for t=1 to5.

So, let me express each D:

D1 = D0 *1.25
D2= D0*(1.25)^2
...
D5 = D0*(1.25)^5

So, the present value of D1 to D5 is:

Sum = D0 * [1.25/(1.115) + (1.25)^2/(1.115)^2 + ... + (1.25)^5/(1.115)^5 ]

Which is the same as earlier, which we calculated as approximately 7.1167 * D0.

Then, the terminal value is the present value of all dividends from year 6 onwards. The dividends from year 6 onwards form a growing perpetuity with growth rate 8%.

The value of a perpetuity is D6 / (Re - g2) = D6 / (0.115 -0.08) = D6 /0.035.

But D6 = D0 *2.5 *1.25^5 *1.08 ≈ D0 *8.243 as above.

So, the terminal value at year 5 is:

TV = D6 /0.035 = (D0 *8.243)/0.035 ≈D0 *235.514

Then, the present value of TV is TV / (1.115)^5 ≈235.514 /1.7184 ≈137.04 * D0.

So, total P0 = 7.1167*D0 +137.04*D0 ≈144.1567 * D0.

But PE ratio is P0 / EPS0. Since D0 =0.20 * EPS0 → EPS0 =D0/0.20.

So, PE = (144.1567 * D0) / (D0 /0.20) )= 144.1567 *0.20 ≈28.83.

Hmm, that's close to option A:28.75. So the answer would be A.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make any errors.

First, the sum of the first five terms: we had 7.1167 when using EPS terms, but when using D0, it's the same sum but in terms of D0. Then, the terminal value calculation: I think I might have made a mistake in the D6 calculation.

Wait, let me re-calculate D6 correctly.

D6 =0.50 * EPS6.

EPS6 = EPS0 *1.25^5 *1.08.

But D0 =0.20 * EPS0 → EPS0 = D0 /0.20.

So EPS6 = (D0 /0.20) *1.25^5 *1.08.

Thus, D6 =0.50 * (D0 /0.20) *1.25^5 *1.08 = D0 * (0.50 /0.20) *1.25^5 *1.08 = D0 *2.5 *3.0518 *1.08.

Compute 3.0518 *1.08 ≈3.2972.

Then, 2.5 *3.2972 ≈8.243.

So D6 = D0 *8.243.

Then, the terminal value at year 5 is D6 / (Re -g2) =8.243 D0 /0.035 ≈235.514 D0.

Then, present value of TV is 235.514 D0 /1.115^5 ≈235.514 /1.7184 ≈137.04 D0.

So, P0 = sum of first five D's PV + TV PV.

Sum of first five D's PV: D0 [1.25/(1.115) + 1.25^2/(1.115)^2 + ... +1.25^5/(1.115)^5 ].

We calculated the sum as approximately 7.1167 when using EPS0, but in terms of D0, it's the same sum multiplied by D0, because each term is D0*(1.25^t /1.115^t).

So, the sum is 7.1167 * D0.

Thus, P0 =7.1167 D0 +137.04 D0 ≈144.1567 D0.

PE ratio = P0 / EPS0 =144.1567 D0 / (D0 /0.20) )=144.1567 *0.20 ≈28.83.

So, the closest option is A:28.75.

I think that's correct. So the answer is A.
</think>

To estimate the PE ratio for the firm, we use a two-stage dividend discount model. The firm's dividends grow at 25% for the first five years with a 20% payout ratio, and then at 8% indefinitely with a 50% payout ratio. The cost of equity is 11.5%.

1. **Dividends for the first five years**:  
   \( D_t = D_0 \times (1.25)^t \) for \( t = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 \).

2. **Terminal value at year 5**:  
   \( D_6 = 0.50 \times EPS_6 = 0.50 \times (EPS_0 \times 1.25^5 \times 1.08) \).  
   Using \( D_0 = 0.20 \times EPS_0 \), we find \( D_6 = D_0 \times 8.243 \).  
   The terminal value is \( TV = \frac{D_6}{0.115 - 0.08} = \frac{D_0 \times 8.243}{0.035} \approx D_0 \times 235.514 \).  
   Discounting back to the present: \( TV_{PV} = \frac{235.514 \times D_0}{(1.115)^5} \approx 137.04 \times D_0 \).

3. **Present value of dividends for the first five years**:  
   \( \sum_{t=1}^{5} \frac{D_t}{(1.115)^t} = D_0 \times 7.1167 \).

4. **Total stock price**:  
   \( P_0 = 7.1167 \times D_0 + 137.04 \times D_0 \approx 144.1567 \times D_0 \).

5. **PE ratio**:  
   \( PE = \frac{P_0}{EPS_0} = \frac{144.1567 \times D_0}{D_0 / 0.20} = 144.1567 \times 0.20 \approx 28.83 \).

The closest option is **A: 28.75**.

Answer: A
