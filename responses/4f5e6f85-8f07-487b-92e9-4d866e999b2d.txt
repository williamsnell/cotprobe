Okay, so I have this question about finding the mass of the Martian atmosphere. Hmm, I remember that atmospheric pressure relates to mass somehow. Let me think about the physics involved here. 

Pressure is defined as force per unit area, right? And the formula for pressure is P = F/A. But wait, in the context of atmospheres, the force is actually the weight of the air above a certain point, which is the mass times gravity. So maybe the formula becomes P = (m * g) / A. 

So if I rearrange that formula to solve for mass, m, it would be m = (P * A) / g. That makes sense because pressure times area gives force, and then dividing by gravity gives mass. 

Now, the given values are: pressure P is 600 pascals, gravity g is 4 m/s², and the surface area A is 145,000,000 square kilometers. Wait, but the units are different. Pascals are in SI units, so 1 pascal is 1 N/m². The surface area is given in square kilometers, so I need to convert that to square meters to keep the units consistent. 

Let me do that conversion. 1 square kilometer is (1000 meters)^2 = 1,000,000 square meters. So 145,000,000 km² is 145,000,000 * 1,000,000 m². Let me calculate that. 

145,000,000 times 1,000,000 is 1.45e17 m². Wait, no, wait. 145,000,000 is 1.45e8, and multiplying by 1e6 gives 1.45e14 m². Wait no, 1e8 * 1e6 is 1e14. So 145e6 * 1e6 = 1.45e8 * 1e6 = 1.45e14 m². Okay, that's the surface area.

So now plugging into m = (P * A) / g. P is 600 Pa, A is 1.45e14 m², and g is 4 m/s².

So m = (600 * 1.45e14) / 4.

Let me compute this step by step. 

First, 600 divided by 4 is 150. So 150 * 1.45e14 = ?

150 * 1.45 is 217.5. So 217.5e14 kg. Wait, 217.5e14 is the same as 2.175e16 kg. 

Looking at the options, I see option C is 2.2e16 kg. That's close to my calculation. 

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations. Maybe I made a mistake in unit conversion. Let me go through it again.

Pressure P = 600 Pa = 600 N/m².

Surface area A = 145,000,000 km². Convert to m²: 145e6 km² * (1e3 m / 1 km)^2 = 145e6 * 1e6 m² = 1.45e14 m². Correct. 

So m = (600 * 1.45e14) / 4.

600 * 1.45e14 = 8.7e16. Then divided by 4 is 2.175e16. So approximately 2.2e16 kg. 

Looking at the options, option C is 2.2x10^16 kg. So that's the right answer.

The mass of the Martian atmosphere can be calculated using the formula \( m = \frac{P \cdot A}{g} \), where \( P \) is pressure, \( A \) is surface area, and \( g \) is acceleration due to gravity. Converting the surface area from square kilometers to square meters and plugging in the given values yields a mass of approximately \( 2.2 \times 10^{16} \) kg.
