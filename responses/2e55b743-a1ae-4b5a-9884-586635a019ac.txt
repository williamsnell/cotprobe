Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which statement is incorrect about a perfectly competitive firm in the long run. Let me start by recalling what I know about perfectly competitive markets and firms in them.

First, in perfect competition, there are a lot of firms and each one is very small compared to the market. That means each firm is a price taker; they can't influence the price because the market is so big. So, the price is set by the market, and all firms take that price as given.

In the long run, firms can enter or exit the market. This means that the industry supply adjusts until economic profits are zero. So, in the long run, firms won't make any profits or losses because new firms will come in if they're making profits, driving prices down, and existing firms will leave if they're losing money, which would drive prices up.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: Price equals marginal revenue. I remember that in perfect competition, because the firm can sell as much as it wants at the market price, marginal revenue is equal to the price. So, A seems correct. MR = P.

Option B: Price equals minimum average cost. In the long run, firms will produce at the point where average cost is minimized. Since there are no profits, the price must equal the minimum average cost. So B is correct.

Option C: Price equals minimum average variable cost. Wait, minimum average variable cost is the shut-down point in the short run. If price is below that, the firm should shut down. But in the long run, firms have exited until price equals minimum average cost, not just variable cost. So in the long run, price is above the minimum average variable cost, because if it weren't, firms would exit even more. So C might be incorrect because in the long run, price should be equal to the minimum average cost, not just the variable cost.

Option D: Price equals marginal cost. Yes, because in the long run, firms produce where MC equals MR, which is the price. So D is correct.

So putting it together, the incorrect statement is C because in the long run, price equals the minimum average cost, not the minimum average variable cost. In the short run, if price is below the minimum average variable cost, the firm would shut down, but in the long run, they've already exited until price is at the minimum average cost.

The incorrect statement is C. In the long run, price equals the minimum average cost, not the minimum average variable cost.

Answer: C
