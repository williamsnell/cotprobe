Okay, so I've got this problem here about calculating how many calories of heat are needed to raise the temperature of water. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of the formulas, but I'll do my best.

First, I remember that the formula for heat transfer is Q = mcΔT. Where Q is the heat energy, m is the mass, c is the specific heat capacity, and ΔT is the change in temperature. Right, so I need to find Q.

The problem says we have 3.0 liters of water. Hmm, wait, liters. I think specific heat capacity is usually given in terms of mass, like per gram or per kilogram. Oh right, water has a density of about 1 gram per milliliter, which is the same as 1 kilogram per liter. So 3 liters would be 3 kilograms, which is 3000 grams. That makes sense.

Next, the temperature change. The water goes from 20°C to 80°C. So the change ΔT is 80 minus 20, which is 60 degrees. So ΔT = 60°C.

Now, the specific heat capacity (c) of water. I think it's 1 calorie per gram per degree Celsius. Wait, no, wait. Calories can be a bit confusing. The specific heat of water is actually 1 calorie/(gram·°C), but sometimes people use kilocalories, which is what the options are in. Oh, right! Because 1 kilocalorie (kcal) is equal to 1000 calories. So I need to make sure I'm using the right units.

So putting it all together: Q = m * c * ΔT.

m is 3000 grams, c is 1 cal/(g°C), and ΔT is 60°C.

Calculating that: Q = 3000 * 1 * 60 = 180,000 calories. Wait, that's a lot. But the options are in kilocalories. So I need to convert calories to kilocalories by dividing by 1000.

180,000 calories divided by 1000 is 180 kilocalories. Hmm, looking at the options, D is 180 kcal. So that should be the answer. 

Wait, let me double-check. Oh, wait! Did I get the specific heat right? Because sometimes I see it written as 4.184 J/(g°C), but since the question uses calories, it's probably using the cal value. So yeah, c is 1 cal/(g°C). So the calculation should be correct. 

Another thing, the question uses 'calories of heat', which I think refers to kilocalories in food terms, so the answer would be 180 kcal, which is option D.

The heat required is calculated using Q = mcΔT. With 3.0 liters of water (3000 grams), a temperature change of 60°C, and water's specific heat of 1 cal/(g°C), Q = 3000 * 1 * 60 = 180,000 calories. Converting to kilocalories gives 180 kcal, which corresponds to option D.

Answer: D
