Okay, so I need to figure out George's total earnings for last week. Let's see, the problem says he sells vacuum cleaners for $75 each and gets a 30% commission on each. He sold 13 machines. Hmm, so I think I need to calculate the total commission he earned from selling those 13 units and then that's his earnings, right?

Wait, but wait a minute, does the $75 include his commission or is that the selling price, and the commission is separate? The way it's phrased, "he receives a 30% commission on each cleaner," I think it means that for each $75 sale, he gets 30% of that. So the total earnings would be the commission from each sale multiplied by the number of units sold.

So first, let's calculate the commission per unit. 30% of $75 is... let me do that. 30% is 0.3 in decimal. So 0.3 multiplied by 75. Let me compute that. 0.3 times 70 is 21, and 0.3 times 5 is 1.5, so 21 + 1.5 equals $22.5 per unit. So for each vacuum cleaner he sells, he earns $22.5 in commission.

Now, he sold 13 machines last week. So the total earnings would be 13 multiplied by $22.5. Let me calculate that. 10 times 22.5 is 225, and 3 times 22.5 is 67.5. Adding those together, 225 + 67.5 equals $292.5.

Wait, but looking at the options, J is $292.50. But wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Sometimes when I'm doing quick math, I might slip up.

So, 30% of 75 is indeed 22.5. Because 75 divided by 10 is 7.5, times 3 is 22.5. Yep, that's correct. Then 13 times 22.5. Let me break it down differently. 22.5 times 10 is 225, plus 22.5 times 3 is 67.5, which totals 292.5. So yes, that's correct.

Wait, but looking at the options again, J is $292.50. So that should be the answer. But wait, let me make sure I didn't misread the question. Sometimes questions can be tricky, like whether the commission is on the selling price or something else. But the question clearly says he receives a 30% commission on each cleaner, which is sold for $75. So yes, it's 30% of 75 per unit.

Alternatively, maybe I should calculate the total sales first and then take 30% of that. Let me try that approach as a cross-check. Each unit is $75, so 13 units would be 13 * 75. Let's compute that. 10*75 is 750, and 3*75 is 225. So 750 + 225 equals 975. So total sales are $975. Then 30% of that is 0.3 * 975. Let's calculate that. 975 * 0.3: 900 * 0.3 is 270, and 75 * 0.3 is 22.5. Adding them together gives 270 + 22.5 = 292.5. So that's the same result as before. So yes, George's total earnings are $292.50, which is option J.

Wait, but I'm looking at the options again and I see option E is $975, which is the total sales. So the question is asking about his earnings, which are the commission, not the total sales. So E is clearly the total sales, not his earnings. So the correct answer should be J, $292.50.

George sells each vacuum cleaner for $75 and receives a 30% commission on each sale. To calculate his total earnings from selling 13 machines, we first determine the commission per unit: 30% of $75 is $22.5. Multiplying this by the number of units sold (13) gives $292.50. Therefore, the correct answer is J.

Answer: J
