Okay, let's try to work through this problem step by step. So, the question is about calculating the accrued liability for unemployment claims that Boca Company should report on its balance sheet. Let me read the question again and break it down.

First, the company, Boca Co., has a choice under state law. They can either reimburse the state directly for actual unemployment claims or pay 3% of eligible gross wages. Boca believes that the actual unemployment claims will be 2% of eligible gross wages and has chosen to reimburse the state. 

Eligible gross wages are defined as the first $15,000 of gross wages paid to each employee. So, for each employee, only the first $15k of their earnings are considered when calculating the unemployment liability.

Boca has four employees, each earning $20,000 during the year. So each employee's eligible gross wages are $15,000 because that's the cap.

Now, the company has chosen to reimburse the state based on actual claims, which they estimate will be 2% of eligible gross wages. So, instead of paying 3% of the eligible wages, they're opting to pay the actual claims expected to be 2% of that amount.

Wait, so I need to calculate the expected actual claims and then determine the liability based on that. Let me think about this.

Each employee's eligible wages: $15,000. The expected unemployment claims per employee would be 2% of $15,000. So, 0.02 * 15,000 = $300 per employee. Since there are four employees, the total expected claims would be 4 * $300 = $1,200.

So, since Boca is reimbursing the state directly for the actual claims, their accrued liability should be the total expected claims, which is $1,200. Therefore, looking at the options, A is $1,200.

Wait, but let me double-check. The alternative was paying 3% of eligible wages, but they chose the other option. So they're not paying 3%, but instead, they're estimating 2% of eligible wages as the actual claims. So their liability is based on that 2%, not 3%.

Yes, that makes sense. So each of the four employees contributes $300, totaling $1,200. So the correct answer should be A: $1,200.

The company calculates the unemployment claims as 2% of the first $15,000 of each employee's wages. With four employees, each contributing $300, the total liability is $1,200.

Answer: A
