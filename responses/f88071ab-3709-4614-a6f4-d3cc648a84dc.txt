Okay, so I have this question about life insurance policies, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let's see what the question says. 

It's about comparing the cost of a $5,000 20-payment life insurance policy for a young man who's 25 versus a man who's 45. The options are from A to J, each giving different pairs of numbers. 

First, I need to understand what a 20-payment life insurance policy means. I think it refers to a policy where the premiums are paid for 20 years. So, the person pays for 20 years, and the policy remains in force for their lifetime, right? So, the coverage is for life, but the premiums are paid over 20 years. 

Now, the key here is that the cost will depend on the age of the person because younger people are generally considered lower risk. So, the 25-year-old should have lower premiums compared to the 45-year-old. Wait, no, actually, wait. No, the opposite might be true because older people are a higher risk, so their premiums are higher. But wait, this depends on the type of policy. 

Wait, life insurance policies can be term or whole life. The question says "20-payment life insurance policy," which might be a whole life policy. In whole life insurance, the premiums are fixed, and they pay for the entire life. The premiums are higher because it's a lifetime policy, but the structure includes savings. 

But I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. So, for a 20-payment, perhaps it's a term policy? No, term policies usually have a specific term, like 20 years, and then they expire. But the question is about a life insurance policy that each lives for the term of the policy. Hmm, maybe it's a 20-year term policy. Wait, but the term would be the coverage period, not the payment period. So, perhaps it's a policy where the premiums are paid for 20 years, and the coverage is for life. Or maybe it's a 20-year endowment life insurance where the premiums are paid for 20 years, and then the policy matures. 

Alternatively, maybe it's a 20-year payment plan, meaning the premiums are paid over 20 years, but the policy is for life. So, the younger person would have lower premiums because they live longer and are healthier, so the risk is lower for the insurer. Therefore, the 25-year-old would have lower premiums than the 45-year-old. 

Wait, but looking at the options, some have the first number higher than the second. For example, option A is $3649 and $2207. So, the first number is for the 25-year-old, the second for the 45-year-old. But according to my earlier thought, the 25-year-old should have lower costs. So, if A is $3649 for the young and $2207 for the older, that would mean the older is paying less, which contradicts my earlier thought. That can't be right. So maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. 

Wait, perhaps the question is about the total cost of the policy, not the annual premium. If it's a 20-payment policy, maybe the total amount paid over 20 years. So, the 25-year-old would have lower total premiums because each premium is lower, but over 20 years, the total would be higher than the older person? No, that doesn't make sense. 

Wait, perhaps the cost refers to the total premium each would pay over 20 years. So, if the 25-year-old has lower annual premiums, over 20 years, the total would be less than the older person's total. But let me think about how life insurance premiums are calculated. The older you are, the higher each premium is because the risk of death is higher. So, a 45-year-old would pay more each month than a 25-year-old. 

But the question is about the cost, which could be total or per annum. Let me look at the options again. 

Option C: $110.35 and $182.45. So, the 25-year-old pays $110.35, and the 45-year-old pays $182.45. So, that makes sense because the older person pays more. 

Option H: $2207 and $3649. So, the 25-year-old pays $2207, and the older pays $3649. That would mean the older pays more, which aligns with the idea that older people have higher premiums. 

Wait, but what's the unit here? Are these annual premiums or total? If they are annual, then the 25-year-old pays less. If they are total over 20 years, then the 25-year-old's total would be 20 * annual premium. 

Wait, let's think about the numbers. Let's assume that the 25-year-old has a lower annual premium. For example, if the 25-year-old pays $110.35 per year, over 20 years, that's $2207. The 45-year-old pays $182.45 per year, so over 20 years, that's $3649. That would make option H correct because the 25-year-old's total is $2207, and the older's is $3649. 

Alternatively, if the numbers in the options are annual premiums, then the 25-year-old would pay less each year. So, looking at option C, the 25-year-old pays $110.35 annually, and the older pays $182.45. That makes sense because the older is higher risk. 

But the question says "the cost of a $5,000 20-payment life insurance policy." So, I think it's the total cost over 20 years. So, the 25-year-old would have a lower total cost than the older person. 

Looking at the options, option H says $2207 and $3649. So, the 25-year-old's total is lower than the older person's. That makes sense. 

Alternatively, option A has $3649 and $2207, which would mean the older pays less, which doesn't make sense. So, I think the correct answer is H: $2207 and $3649. 

Wait, but let me think again. If the policy is 20 payments, meaning 20 years, and each pays until the end of the 20 years, then the total cost is the sum of all premiums. So, if the 25-year-old's annual premium is lower, their total would be lower. 

For example, if the 25-year-old pays $110 per year, over 20 years, that's $2200. The 45-year-old pays $182 per year, totaling $3640. So, the totals would be around $2200 and $3640, which matches option H: $2207 and $3649. 

So, the answer should be H.

The cost of a life insurance policy depends on the age of the insured, with younger individuals typically paying less due to lower risk. For a $5,000 20-payment policy, the younger man (25 years old) would have a lower total cost over 20 years compared to the older man (45 years old). Option H reflects this, showing the 25-year-old paying $2207 and the 45-year-old paying $3649. 

Answer: H
