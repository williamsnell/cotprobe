Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the value of ∂²u/∂x² + ∂²u/∂y², where u is arctan(y/x). Hmm, I remember that arctan functions often come up in coordinate systems, maybe polar coordinates? But I'm not sure. Let me think step by step.

First, let's write down u = arctan(y/x). I need to find the second partial derivatives with respect to x and y, then add them together.

Maybe I should start by finding the first partial derivatives. Let's see. The derivative of arctan(z) with respect to z is 1/(1+z²). So, for ∂u/∂x, treating y as a constant, I can use the chain rule.

So, ∂u/∂x = (1/(1 + (y/x)²)) * (-y/x²). Let me simplify that. The denominator becomes (x² + y²)/x². So, 1 divided by that is x²/(x² + y²). Therefore, ∂u/∂x = [x²/(x² + y²)] * (-y/x²) = -y/(x² + y²). Wait, that seems right.

Now, ∂u/∂y would be similar. Treating x as a constant, the derivative is (1/(1 + (y/x)²)) * (1/x). Again, denominator is (x² + y²)/x², so 1 over that is x²/(x² + y²). So, ∂u/∂y = (x²/(x² + y²)) * (1/x) = x/(x² + y²).

Okay, now I need the second partial derivatives. Let's compute ∂²u/∂x² first.

From ∂u/∂x = -y/(x² + y²), which is -y*(x² + y²)^(-1). So, taking the derivative with respect to x again, I'll use the quotient rule or product rule. Let's do it as a product: -y*(x² + y²)^(-1).

The derivative of (x² + y²)^(-1) with respect to x is -2x*(x² + y²)^(-2). So, using the product rule, ∂²u/∂x² = (-y)*(-2x)*(x² + y²)^(-2) + (-y)*(0), since the derivative of a constant (-y) is zero. Wait, no, wait. Wait, actually, the first term is correct: the derivative of -y/(x² + y²) with respect to x is (-y)*(-2x)/(x² + y²)^2, right? So that's (2xy)/(x² + y²)^2.

Wait, let me double-check. The function is -y*(x² + y²)^(-1). The derivative is (-y)*(-1)*(2x)*(x² + y²)^(-2) = (2xy)/(x² + y²)^2. Yes, that's correct.

Now, ∂²u/∂y². Let's start with ∂u/∂y = x/(x² + y²). Taking the derivative with respect to y.

Again, using the product rule: the derivative of x/(x² + y²) is x * derivative of (x² + y²)^(-1) with respect to y. So, that's x*(-1)*(2y)*(x² + y²)^(-2) = -2xy/(x² + y²)^2.

So, ∂²u/∂y² = -2xy/(x² + y²)^2.

Now, adding ∂²u/∂x² + ∂²u/∂y²: that's (2xy)/(x² + y²)^2 + (-2xy)/(x² + y²)^2. Hmm, adding these together, the numerator is 2xy - 2xy, which is 0. So the sum is zero.

Wait, that's interesting. So the sum of the second partial derivatives is zero. So the answer must be D: 0.0.

But wait, maybe I should check my steps again to be sure I didn't make a mistake in signs or calculations.

First, ∂u/∂x: correct.

Second, ∂u/∂y: correct.

Then ∂²u/∂x²: Let me re-do that. Starting from ∂u/∂x = -y/(x² + y²). Let me denote z = x² + y².

So, derivative of -y/z with respect to x is (-y)*(-1)*dz/dx * (1/z²). dz/dx is 2x, so it's (-y)*(-2x)/(z²) = 2xy/(z²). So that's correct.

Similarly, for ∂²u/∂y², starting from ∂u/∂y = x/z. The derivative with respect to y is x*(-1)*dz/dy * (1/z²) = x*(-2y)/(z²) = -2xy/z². So that's correct.

Adding them: 2xy/z² - 2xy/z² = 0. So, yes, the sum is zero. So the correct answer is D: 0.0.

The problem involves finding the sum of the second partial derivatives of \( u = \arctan\left(\frac{y}{x}\right) \) with respect to \( x \) and \( y \). 

First, compute the first partial derivatives:
\[
\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = -\frac{y}{x^2 + y^2}, \quad \frac{\partial u}{\partial y} = \frac{x}{x^2 + y^2}.
\]

Next, compute the second partial derivatives:
\[
\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} = \frac{2xy}{(x^2 + y^2)^2}, \quad \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial y^2} = -\frac{2xy}{(x^2 + y^2)^2}.
\]

Adding these together:
\[
\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial y^2} = \frac{2xy}{(x^2 + y^2)^2} - \frac{2xy}{(x^2 + y^2)^2} = 0.
\]

Thus, the sum is zero.
