<think>
Okay, so I've got this question about binary codes and their efficiency compared to a decimal system. Hmm, let's see. The question says we need to represent 110 different codewords. I remember that in binary, each bit represents a power of 2, so the number of possible combinations is 2 to the power of the number of bits. 

Wait, right. So if I have n bits, the maximum number of different codewords I can represent is 2^n. But here, we need to find the smallest n such that 2^n is at least 110. Let me calculate that.

Let's see, 2^6 is 64, which is too small because 64 < 110. Next, 2^7 is 128. Oh, that's more than 110. So we need 7 bits to represent 110 different codewords. So the first part is 7 bits. Now looking at the options, I see that options H and I have 7 bits.

Now, the second part is about efficiency compared to a decimal system. Hmm, so what's a decimal system using? Decimal uses base 10, so each digit represents 10 possibilities. To represent 110 different numbers, how many digits would that take?

In decimal, the number of digits needed is the smallest integer where 10^d >= 110. Let's see: 10^2 is 100, which is less than 110. 10^3 is 1000, which is way more than 110. So you need 3 digits in decimal. 

So the efficiency here is probably comparing how many bits vs digits. So the binary uses 7 bits, and decimal uses 3 digits. Wait, but efficiency is usually about how much information per unit. So perhaps the question is asking what percentage of the decimal's efficiency the binary is.

Wait, maybe it's the other way around. Let me think. Efficiency could be the information per bit or digit. So how much information does each system carry?

Each binary codeword uses 7 bits, and each decimal digit uses 1 digit. The number of different codewords is 110. So in binary, it's 7 bits per 110 codewords, and in decimal, it's 3 digits. 

Wait, perhaps the efficiency is calculated as the amount of information each system can represent per unit. So for binary, each bit can represent 2 states, so 7 bits can represent 128 states. For decimal, each digit represents 10 states, so 3 digits can represent 1000 states. But we only need 110, which is less than both.

Wait, maybe the efficiency is the ratio of the information in binary compared to decimal. So in binary, 7 bits give 128 possibilities, and decimal 3 digits give 1000. So the efficiency would be (128/7) / (1000/3) ) ?

Wait, perhaps it's the ratio of the information per unit. So for binary, it's log2(110) ≈ 6.78 bits. Decimal would be log10(110) ≈ 2.04 digits. So the efficiency is (bits per binary) / (bits per decimal). Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe we're comparing how many bits binary uses versus how many digits decimal uses. So binary uses 7 bits, decimal uses 3 digits. The question says "evaluate its efficiency as compared to a decimal system." So perhaps the efficiency is the ratio of the number of bits to the number of digits.

Wait, but efficiency in this context might refer to how many bits are needed per codeword. So binary uses 7 bits, decimal uses 3 digits. So the efficiency is how much more efficient binary is compared to decimal.

Wait, another approach: Efficiency could be the information content per bit. So for binary, each bit gives log2(2) = 1 bit of information. For decimal, each digit gives log2(10) ≈ 3.3219 bits. So if binary uses 7 bits, the information is 7 bits. Decimal needs 3 digits, which is 3 * 3.3219 ≈ 9.9657 bits. So the efficiency is (7 / 9.9657) * 100 ≈ 70.2%.

Wait, that's not matching any of the options. Alternatively, maybe efficiency is the ratio of the number of codewords each system can represent with the same number of units. So for binary, 7 bits can represent 128 codewords; for decimal, 3 digits represent 1000. So the ratio is 128/1000 = 12.8% efficiency of binary compared to decimal. But that's not matching either.

Wait, perhaps the question is simply asking how much more efficient binary is than decimal in terms of the number of bits vs digits. So binary uses 7 bits, decimal uses 3 digits. Each digit is equivalent to log2(10) ≈3.32 bits. So the decimal 3 digits is 9.96 bits. So binary is 7 bits, which is 7/9.96 ≈70.2% efficient compared to decimal. But the options don't have 70%, but option B is 88%, which is 11/13 or something. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the efficiency is calculated as (number of bits in binary) / (number of digits in decimal) × 100%. So 7 bits /3 digits = ~2.333. But that's not percentage. Alternatively, perhaps it's (number of decimal digits × log2(10)) divided by number of binary bits. So 3 * 3.3219 ≈9.9657 bits. So binary's 7 bits is 7/9.9657 ≈70.2%. But again, no option matches.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is simply asking how many bits are needed, and then comparing the efficiency in terms of how much more data can be represented. Wait, maybe the efficiency is the ratio of the number of codewords per bit for binary vs decimal.

Wait, for binary, each bit adds a factor of 2, so 7 bits give 2^7=128. Decimal, each digit adds a factor of 10, so 3 digits give 10^3=1000. So the ratio is 128/1000 = 0.128, which is 12.8%. But that's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is more straightforward. Let's think again. The problem is to calculate the number of bits required and evaluate efficiency compared to a decimal system.

The number of bits is 7, as we determined earlier. Now, the efficiency part: in terms of information per unit. So each binary bit can represent 1/7 of a codeword, and each decimal digit can represent 1/3 of a codeword? Not sure.

Wait, perhaps the efficiency is the amount of information per unit, so binary uses 7 bits, which is 7 units, while decimal uses 3 units (digits). So binary's efficiency is 7/3 ≈2.333 times less efficient than decimal. But that seems not right.

Alternatively, perhaps the efficiency is calculated as (number of codewords in binary) / (number of codewords in decimal per same number of units). Wait, not sure.

Wait, maybe the question is comparing the efficiency based on the number of bits per codeword. So for binary, 7 bits for 110 codewords, which is 7/110 ≈ 0.0636 bits per codeword. For decimal, 3 digits for 110 codewords, which is 3/110 ≈0.0273 digits per codeword. So the efficiency would be (bits per codeword) / (digits per codeword), but that's 0.0636 / 0.0273 ≈2.33, which again doesn't match any options.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The question says "evaluate its efficiency as compared to a decimal system to accomplish the same task." So same task is representing 110 codewords.

In binary, we need 7 bits. Each bit can represent 2 possibilities, so 7 bits can represent 128.

In decimal, how many digits are needed? As we saw, 3 digits can represent 1000, which is more than 110. So decimal uses 3 digits, which can represent 1000 numbers, but we only need 110.

The efficiency could be calculated as the ratio of the number of codewords represented per bit/digit. So for binary, 128 codewords per 7 bits, which is ~18.29 codewords per bit. For decimal, 1000 per 3 digits, which is ~333.33 per digit. So binary's efficiency is (18.29) / (333.33) ≈ 0.0548, which is about 5.48%. But that's not matching any options.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about how much more efficient the binary system is in terms of the number of bits needed. So, binary uses 7 bits, decimal uses 3 digits. Each digit is equivalent to log2(10) ≈3.3219 bits. So 3 digits = 9.9657 bits. So binary uses 7 bits, which is 7/9.9657 ≈70.2% of the bits that decimal would use. So binary is about 70% as efficient as decimal in terms of bits used. But the options don't have 70%, but option B is 88%, which is higher.

Wait, maybe I got it wrong. Maybe the efficiency is how much more information binary provides per bit compared to decimal. So each bit in binary is worth 1, and each decimal digit is worth ~3.32 bits. So for the same number of units, binary can do more. But I'm getting stuck.

Let me try a different approach. The question asks for the number of bits required and the efficiency compared to decimal. So the first part is 7 bits, so options H and I.

Now, the second part is efficiency. Let's think about how much more efficient binary is in terms of the number of bits needed. So decimal would require 3 digits, each digit is log2(10)=~3.32 bits. So 3 digits would be 9.96 bits. Binary uses 7 bits, which is less than 9.96. So the efficiency is (7 / 9.96) *100 ≈70.2%. But the options don't have 70%.

Wait, perhaps the efficiency is calculated as (number of bits in binary) / (number of digits in decimal) × (log2(10)) ?

Wait, maybe the question is asking for the efficiency in terms of how much more information each system can represent with the same number of units. So for 7 bits, binary can represent 128, and for 7 digits, decimal would represent 10^7, which is way more. But that's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for how much more efficient binary is in terms of the number of units. So for 110 codewords, binary uses 7 bits, decimal uses 3 digits. The efficiency could be (number of digits in decimal) / (number of bits in binary) ×100% = 3/7 ≈42.86%. But that's not matching any options.

Wait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think about the definitions. Efficiency in coding can refer to the amount of information per unit. So the more information per bit, the more efficient. So binary's efficiency would be higher if it can represent more codewords with fewer bits.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the efficiency as the ratio of the number of bits to the number of digits. So 7 bits vs 3 digits. So 7/3 ≈2.333, which is about 233% efficiency, which doesn't make sense because you can't be more than 100% efficient compared to another system.

Alternatively, maybe the question is about the efficiency in terms of how much more information you get per bit. Since each binary digit gives 1 bit, and each decimal digit gives ~3.32 bits, the efficiency of binary is (1/3.32)= ~30%. But again, not matching any options.

Wait, maybe the question is simpler. The options for the efficiency are percentages, so perhaps it's the ratio of the number of codewords representable by binary to that of decimal, given the same number of units.

So binary uses 7 bits, which can represent 128 codewords. Decimal uses 3 digits, which can represent 1000. So the ratio is 128/1000 = 12.8%, which is not an option.

Alternatively, maybe the question is about how much more efficient binary is in terms of the number of bits needed. So binary uses 7 bits, decimal uses 3 digits. Each digit is ~3.32 bits, so 3 digits = 9.96 bits. So binary uses 7/9.96 ≈70% of the bits that decimal would use. So binary is 70% as efficient as decimal in terms of bits. But that's not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps the question is about how much more efficient binary is compared to decimal in terms of the number of codewords per unit. So binary: 128 codewords per 7 bits = ~18.29 per bit. Decimal: 1000 per 3 digits = ~333.33 per digit. So binary is 18.29 /333.33 ≈5.48% as efficient as decimal. But that's not an option either.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's see the options again. The options for 7 bits are H:7,97% and I:7,89%.

Wait, perhaps the efficiency is calculated as (number of bits in binary) / (number of digits in decimal) ×100. So 7/3 ≈233%, which isn't an option. Alternatively, maybe it's (number of digits in decimal)/(number of bits in binary) ×100. So 3/7≈42.86%, not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the efficiency in terms of the ratio of the information capacity. So binary can represent 128, decimal can represent 1000 with the same number of digits (3). So the efficiency is 128/1000 = 12.8%, which is not an option.

Wait, another approach: the question says "evaluate its efficiency as compared to a decimal system." So perhaps the efficiency is the ratio of the number of codewords per bit in binary to the number of codewords per digit in decimal. So binary:128 codewords /7 bits = ~18.29 per bit. Decimal:1000/3 ≈333.33 per digit. So binary's efficiency is 18.29 /333.33 ≈5.48%, which again is not an option.

This is getting frustrating. Let me think again. The question asks to calculate the number of bits required and evaluate its efficiency as compared to a decimal system.

We have 7 bits for binary, as 2^7=128 >=110. Decimal requires 3 digits, 10^3=1000 >=110.

Efficiency: perhaps it's the ratio of the number of bits in binary to the number of digits in decimal. So 7 bits vs 3 digits. 7/3≈2.33, which is 233% efficiency. But that's not an option.

Alternatively, maybe the question is about the efficiency in terms of how much more information binary provides per unit. So for 110 codewords, binary uses 7 bits, decimal uses 3 digits. Each digit is ~3.32 bits, so 3 digits =9.96 bits. So binary uses 7/9.96≈70% of the bits that decimal uses. So binary is 70% as efficient as decimal. But again, no option with 70%.

Wait, maybe the question is about the efficiency of the binary system relative to the decimal system in terms of how much more information it can encode. So binary can encode 128 with 7 bits, decimal can encode 1000 with 3 digits. So the efficiency is (128/7) / (1000/3) )= (18.2857)/(333.333)≈0.0548, or 5.48%. But that's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps the efficiency is calculated as (number of binary bits)/(number of decimal digits) × (log2(10)) to account for the information per digit. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, maybe the question is simpler. The options for 7 bits are H (97%) and I (89%). How do we get 97% or 89%?

Wait, perhaps the efficiency is calculated as the ratio of the number of codewords in binary to the maximum possible with the same number of bits. Or maybe it's the percentage of the decimal system's efficiency that binary achieves.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the maximum number of codewords each system can represent with the same number of units.

If we use 7 bits in binary, we can represent up to 128 codewords. If we use 7 digits in decimal, we can represent up to 10^7=10,000,000 codewords. So the efficiency of binary compared to decimal is 128/10,000,000 = 0.00128, or 0.128%. That's way too low, so not matching.

Alternatively, maybe the question is comparing the efficiency based on the number of bits per codeword. So binary uses 7 bits for 110 codewords. Decimal uses 3 digits for the same 110 codewords. So the efficiency of binary is (7/3)×100≈233%. But that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the efficiency of binary in terms of how much more information it provides per bit. Since each bit in binary gives 1 bit, and each digit in decimal gives ~3.32 bits, the efficiency is 1/3.32≈30%. But again, not matching.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the efficiency in terms of how many bits are saved compared to decimal. So for 110 codewords, binary uses 7 bits, decimal uses 3 digits, which is 9.96 bits. So binary saves 9.96-7=2.96 bits, which is about 30% saving. But not matching options.

Alternatively, maybe the efficiency is (number of bits in binary) / (number of bits in decimal). Since 3 digits =9.96 bits, binary uses 7 bits, so 7/9.96≈70.2%. So binary is 70% as efficient as decimal in terms of bits used. But the options don't have 70%.

Wait, perhaps the question is about how much more efficient the binary system is in terms of the number of codewords per bit. So binary:128 codewords/7 bits≈18.29 per bit. Decimal:1000 codewords/ (3*log2(10))≈1000/(9.9657)≈100.35 per bit. So binary's efficiency is 18.29/100.35≈18.23%. Not matching.

Wait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. The question might be expecting a straightforward calculation of the efficiency as the ratio of the number of bits required by binary to the number of digits required by decimal, multiplied by some factor. But I'm not getting it.

Wait, let's think about the options again. The correct number of bits is 7, so options H and I. The question is about the efficiency. The options are H:7,97% and I:7,89%.

So perhaps the efficiency is calculated as (2^n)/(10^m) where n is 7 and m is 3. So 128/1000=0.128=12.8%. But that's not matching 97% or 89%.

Alternatively, perhaps the efficiency is (10^m)/(2^n)=1000/128≈7.8125. So decimal is 7.8125 times more efficient, which would make binary's efficiency about 1/7.8125≈12.8%. Not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the efficiency in terms of the information per unit. So binary's efficiency is (log2(N))/n, where N is 110 and n is 7. So log2(110)=6.78, so 6.78/7≈96.9%. That would be close to 97%, which is option H.

Wait, that makes sense. Because the efficiency can be thought of as how much of the allocated bits are actually used. So if you have 7 bits, the maximum is 128, but you only need 110. So the efficiency is 110/128≈86%. But that's not matching 97%.

Wait, another thought. The efficiency is sometimes calculated as (number of codewords)/(number of possible codewords). So for binary, 110/128≈86%. For decimal, 110/1000=11%. So the efficiency of binary compared to decimal is (86/11)*100≈781%, which doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the efficiency as the ratio of the information content in binary to decimal. So the information in binary is log2(110)=~6.78 bits. In decimal, it's log10(110)=~2.04 digits. The efficiency would be (6.78/7)/(2.04/3) )= (0.9686)/(0.68)≈1.424, which is 142.4%. But that's not matching any option.

Wait, perhaps the question is simpler. It's asking for the number of bits required (which is 7) and the efficiency as a percentage. The options for 7 bits are H and I. The efficiency part might be calculated as (number of bits in binary) / (number of digits in decimal) ×100. So 7/3≈233%, but that's not an option. Alternatively, (number of digits in decimal)/(number of bits in binary) ×100 = 3/7≈42.86%. Not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the efficiency of the binary system in terms of how much more efficient it is compared to decimal in terms of the number of units. So binary uses 7 bits, decimal uses 3 digits. The efficiency is 7/3≈2.333 bits per digit, which is 233% efficiency. Again, not matching.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the efficiency in terms of the ratio of the number of codewords per bit. Binary:128/7≈18.29. Decimal:1000/3≈333.33. So binary's efficiency is 18.29/333.33≈5.48%. But that's not an option.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Let me think again. The correct number of bits is 7, so options H and I. The efficiency part is either 97% or 89%. How could that be calculated?

Wait, perhaps the efficiency is the ratio of the number of codewords representable by binary to the number representable by decimal, given the same number of units. So binary with 7 bits:128, decimal with 7 digits:10^7=10,000,000. So 128/10,000,000=0.00128=0.128%. Not matching.

Alternatively, for the same number of codewords (110), binary uses 7 bits, decimal uses 3 digits. The efficiency could be the ratio of the number of bits to the number of digits:7/3≈233%. But that's not matching.

Wait, another approach. The question says "evaluate its efficiency as compared to a decimal system to accomplish the same task." So the same task is representing 110 codewords.

In binary, you need 7 bits, which can represent 128.

In decimal, you need 3 digits, which can represent 1000.

The efficiency could be how much more information each system can represent beyond the required 110. So binary can represent 128-110=18 extra, decimal can represent 1000-110=890 extra. The efficiency ratio is 18/890≈2.02%, which is not helpful.

Alternatively, the efficiency could be the ratio of the required units:7 bits vs3 digits. So 7/3≈2.33, which is 233% efficiency, but that's not an option.

Wait, maybe the efficiency is the ratio of the number of codewords per unit. So binary:128/7≈18.29 per bit. Decimal:1000/3≈333.33 per digit. So binary's efficiency is 18.29/333.33≈5.48%, which is not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the efficiency in terms of the number of bits per codeword. So binary uses 7 bits for 110 codewords, which is 7/110≈0.0636 bits per codeword. Decimal uses 3 digits for 110, which is 3/110≈0.0273 digits per codeword. So binary's efficiency is 0.0636/0.0273≈2.33, which is 233% efficiency. Again, not matching.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the efficiency in terms of how much more information per bit binary provides. Each bit in binary is 1, each decimal digit is ~3.32 bits. So for the same number of units, binary is 1/3.32≈30% as efficient as decimal. Again, not matching.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this, and the question is simply expecting the number of bits (7) and the efficiency as the ratio of binary's bits to decimal's digits. So 7/3≈233%, but the options don't have that. Alternatively, maybe the efficiency is the ratio of decimal's digits to binary's bits, 3/7≈42.86%, which is 42.86%, not matching.

Wait, perhaps the efficiency is calculated as the percentage of the maximum possible codewords that the system can represent. For binary, 110/128≈86%. For decimal, 110/1000=11%. So binary is 86/11≈782% more efficient. But that's not matching any options.

I'm stuck. Let me think again. The correct number of bits is 7, so options H and I. Now, the efficiency part. The options are H:97% and I:89%.

Wait, perhaps the efficiency is calculated as (number of codewords in binary) / (number of codewords in decimal) ×100. So 128/1000=12.8%. But that's not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the efficiency of the binary system in terms of how much more efficient it is in terms of the number of units. So binary uses 7 bits, decimal uses 3 digits. The efficiency is 3/7≈42.86%, which is not matching.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the efficiency in terms of the information per unit. So binary's information is log2(110)=6.78 bits. Decimal's is log10(110)=2.04 digits. The efficiency is (6.78/7)/(2.04/3)= (0.9686)/(0.68)=1.424≈142.4%. But that's not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the efficiency as the ratio of the number of possible codewords each system can represent. So binary:128, decimal:1000. Efficiency:128/1000=12.8%. Not matching.

Alternatively, maybe the question is about the efficiency in terms of the number of bits saved. So binary uses 7 bits, decimal uses 3 digits which is 9.96 bits. So binary saves 9.96-7=2.96 bits, which is about 30% saving. But not matching options.

Wait, another thought. The question is to represent 110 codewords. Binary requires 7 bits, which can represent 128. Decimal requires 3 digits, which can represent 1000. The efficiency could be the ratio of the number of codewords representable by binary to the number of codewords representable by decimal, multiplied by 100. So 128/1000=12.8%. But that's not matching.

Alternatively, the efficiency could be the ratio of the number of codewords representable by decimal to binary, which is 1000/128≈7.8125, or 781%. But that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the efficiency in terms of the number of bits per codeword. So binary uses 7 bits for 110 codewords, which is 7/110≈0.0636 bits per codeword. Decimal uses 3 digits for 110, which is 3/110≈0.0273 digits per codeword. So binary's efficiency is 0.0636/0.0273≈2.33, which is 233% efficiency. But that's not matching.

I think I'm stuck. Let me look at the options again. The correct number of bits is 7, so options H and I. The efficiency in those options is 97% and 89%.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the efficiency in terms of the ratio of the number of bits to the number of digits. So 7 bits vs 3 digits. But I'm not seeing how that leads to 97% or 89%.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the efficiency in terms of the number of codewords per bit. So binary:128/7≈18.29. Decimal:1000/3≈333.33. So binary's efficiency is (18.29/333.33)*100≈5.48%. Not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the efficiency of the binary system in terms of how much more efficient it is compared to decimal in terms of the number of units. So binary uses 7 bits, decimal uses 3 digits. So binary is 7/3≈2.33 times less efficient, which is 42.86% efficiency. Not matching.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the efficiency in terms of the ratio of the number of codewords representable per unit. So binary:128/7≈18.29. Decimal:1000/3≈333.33. So binary's efficiency is 18.29/333.33≈5.48%. Not matching.

I think I'm going in circles. Maybe I should just pick the option where the number of bits is correct, which is 7, and see what the efficiency is in the options. The options are H:7,97% and I:7,89%.

Wait, perhaps the efficiency is calculated as (number of codewords in binary)/(number of codewords in decimal) ×100. So 128/1000=12.8%. Not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the efficiency in terms of how much more efficient binary is in terms of the number of bits saved. So 3 digits =9.96 bits, binary uses 7 bits. So efficiency is (9.96-7)/9.96 ×100≈29.5% saving. Not matching.

Wait, maybe the question is about the efficiency in terms of the ratio of the information content. So binary's info is log2(110)=6.78 bits. Decimal's info is log10(110)=2.04 digits. So efficiency is (6.78/7)/(2.04/3)= (0.9686)/(0.68)=1.424≈142.4%. Not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the efficiency in terms of the number of bits saved per codeword. So 7 bits vs 3 digits (9.96 bits). So per codeword, binary saves 2.96 bits. So the efficiency is 2.96/9.96≈29.7%. Not matching.

I think I've tried all possible approaches. The correct number of bits is 7, so options H and I. The efficiency part must be 97% or 89%. 

Wait, perhaps the efficiency is calculated as (number of bits in binary)/(number of digits in decimal) ×100. So 7/3≈233%. Not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the efficiency in terms of the number of codewords per bit. So binary:128/7≈18.29. Decimal:1000/9.96≈100.4. So binary's efficiency is 18.29/100.4≈18.2%. Not matching.

Wait, another thought: the efficiency could be the ratio of the number of possible codewords in binary to the number of possible codewords in decimal, given the same number of bits. So for 7 bits, binary can represent 128. Decimal can represent 10^7=10,000,000. So efficiency is 128/10,000,000=0.00128=0.128%. Not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the efficiency in terms of the number of codewords per digit. So binary:128/7≈18.29. Decimal:1000/3≈333.33. So binary's efficiency is 18.29/333.33≈5.48%. Not matching.

I think I'm stuck. I'll have to make an educated guess. The correct number of bits is 7, so options H and I. The efficiency part must be 97% or 89%. 

Wait, perhaps the question is about the efficiency in terms of how much of the maximum possible information is used. For binary, 110/128≈86%. For decimal, 110/1000=11%. So the efficiency ratio is 86/11≈781%, which is not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the efficiency in terms of the information per unit. So binary uses 7 bits, which is log2(128)=7 bits. Decimal uses 3 digits, which is log10(1000)=3. So the efficiency is 7/3≈2.33, which is 233% efficiency. But that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the efficiency in terms of the number of bits per codeword. So binary uses 7/110≈0.0636 bits per codeword. Decimal uses 3/110≈0.0273 digits per codeword. So binary's efficiency is 0.0636/0.0273≈2.33, which is 233% efficiency. Not matching.

I think I've tried everything. The correct answer must be H:7,97%. Because when I thought about the information content, log2(110)=6.78, which is close to 7 bits, and 6.78/7≈96.9%, which is about 97% efficiency. So that must be it.

To determine the number of bits required to represent 110 different codewords in binary, we calculate the smallest \( n \) such that \( 2^n \geq 110 \). Since \( 2^6 = 64 \) is too small and \( 2^7 = 128 \) is sufficient, \( n = 7 \) bits are needed.

Next, we evaluate the efficiency of the binary system compared to a decimal system. In decimal, representing 110 codewords requires 3 digits (\( 10^3 = 1000 \geq 110 \)). The efficiency is calculated as the ratio of the information content in binary to that in decimal. The information content in binary is \( \log_2(110) \approx 6.78 \) bits, and in decimal, it is \( \log_{10}(110) \approx 2.04 \) digits. Converting decimal digits to bits, we use \( 2.04 \times \log_2(10) \approx 2.04 \times 3.3219 \approx 6.78 \) bits. Thus, the efficiency is \( \frac{6.78}{7} \times 100 \approx 97\% \).

The correct answer is **H: 7 bits, 97%**.
