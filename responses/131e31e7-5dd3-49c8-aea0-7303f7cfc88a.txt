Okay, so I have this question about cystic fibrosis mutations, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me start by recalling what I know about cystic fibrosis. It's a genetic disorder that affects the lungs, digestion, and other systems. I remember that it's caused by mutations in the CFTR gene.

The question is asking about the most common mutation type in cystic fibrosis. The options are various types of mutations: inversion, substitution, deletion, missense, insertion, nonsense, translocation, silent, frameshift, and duplication.

I think the most common mutation in CF is a specific one called ΔF508. Wait, what kind of mutation is that? ΔF508 stands for the deletion of three nucleotides, which removes the amino acid phenylalanine from the protein. So that's a deletion mutation. But wait, a three-nucleotide deletion would remove one amino acid, right? So that's a deletion, which is a type of point mutation. But sometimes deletions can cause frameshifts if they're not in multiples of three, but in this case, it's three nucleotides, so it doesn't cause a frameshift; it just deletes one amino acid. So that's a substitution? Or a deletion?

Wait, substitution is when one base is replaced by another, like a point mutation. Deletion is when a base or bases are removed. So ΔF508 is a deletion of three nucleotides, leading to a loss of one amino acid. So that would be a deletion mutation. Alternatively, sometimes this is referred to as a frameshift, but no, because the reading frame remains the same since it's a multiple of three. So it's a deletion, not a frameshift.

Looking at the options: option C is deletion. Option I is frameshift. So the correct answer should be C.

Wait, but another thought: sometimes the ΔF508 mutation is described as a missense mutation because it changes the amino acid (by deleting it), but wait, no, a missense mutation is when an amino acid is changed to another, not removed. So ΔF508 is a deletion, not missense.

So the most common mutation is a deletion of three nucleotides, so the answer is C: a deletion.

The most common cystic fibrosis mutation is the ΔF508 mutation, which involves the deletion of three nucleotides. This results in the loss of one amino acid, phenylalanine, from the CFTR protein. This type of mutation is classified as a deletion, as it involves the removal of genetic material rather than a substitution, insertion, or other types. 

Answer: C
