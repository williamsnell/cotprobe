<think>
Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find all the zeros of the polynomial x^5 + 3x^3 + x^2 + 2x in the finite field Z_5. The options are given from A to J, and I need to choose the correct one. Let me try to work through this step by step.

First, I remember that in Z_5, the elements are 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4. So I need to check each of these values in the polynomial to see if they make the polynomial equal to zero.

The polynomial is x^5 + 3x^3 + x^2 + 2x. Let me plug in each element of Z_5 into this polynomial and compute the result modulo 5.

Starting with x=0:
0^5 + 3*(0)^3 + (0)^2 + 2*0 = 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 0. So 0 is a root.

Next, x=1:
1^5 = 1
3*(1)^3 = 3*1 = 3
(1)^2 = 1
2*1 = 2
Adding these up: 1 + 3 + 1 + 2 = 7. Now, 7 mod 5 is 2, which isn't zero. So 1 is not a root.

Wait, that's conflicting with what I thought. Maybe I made a mistake. Let me double-check. 1^5 is 1, 3*1^3 is 3, 1^2 is 1, 2*1 is 2. Sum is 1+3=4, +1=5, +2=7. 7 mod5 is 2, so yeah, not zero. So 1 is not a root. Hmm, but let me think again because I might have made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, maybe I should try x=2.

x=2:
2^5 is 32, which mod5 is 2 because 32/5=6*5=30, remainder 2.
3*(2)^3: 2^3=8, mod5 is 3. So 3*3=9, mod5 is 4.
(2)^2=4, mod5 is 4.
2*2=4, mod5 is 4.
Adding them all: 2 (from x^5) +4 (3x^3) +4 (x^2) +4 (2x) = 2+4=6, +4=10, +4=14. 14 mod5 is 4. So 4 ≠0, so 2 isn't a root.

Wait, that can't be right. Did I compute 2^5 correctly? 2^5 is 32, which is 5*6=30, so 32-30=2, yes. 3x^3: 3*(8)=24, which mod5 is 4 because 5*4=20, 24-20=4. Then x^2 is 4, 2x is 4. So sum is 2+4+4+4=14, which mod5 is 4. So yes, not zero.

Now x=3:
3^5: Let's compute 3^2=9≡4 mod5, 3^3=3*4=12≡2, 3^4=3*2=6≡1, 3^5=3*1=3 mod5.
3x^3: 3*(3^3)=3*(2)=6≡1 mod5.
x^2: 3^2=9≡4.
2x: 2*3=6≡1.
Adding up: 3 +1 +4 +1 =9. 9 mod5 is 4. Not zero, so 3 isn't a root.

Next, x=4:
4^5: Let's compute 4^2=16≡1, 4^3=4*1=4, 4^4=4*4=16≡1, 4^5=4*1=4.
3x^3: 3*(4^3)=3*4=12≡2 mod5.
x^2: 4^2=16≡1.
2x: 2*4=8≡3 mod5.
Adding them: 4 (from x^5) +2 (3x^3) +1 (x^2) +3 (2x) = 4+2=6, +1=7, +3=10. 10 mod5 is 0. So x=4 is a root.

Wait, but earlier when I tried x=1, I got 2, not zero. So then, the roots I found so far are 0 and 4. Let me check the options to see if this matches any.

Looking at the options:

F: 0,4
H: 0,3
E: 0,1,2
A:1,2
D:3,4
I:2,3
J:0,1
G:0
B:0,1,2,3
C:1
H:0,3
Wait, option F is 0 and 4. So that's a possible answer.

Wait, but earlier when I checked x=1, I thought it wasn't a root, but let me double-check because maybe I made a mistake.

x=1 again: 1^5=1, 3*(1)^3=3, (1)^2=1, 2*1=2. Sum:1+3+1+2=7. 7 mod5 is 2, so not zero.

Wait, but maybe I should check x=0, 1, 2, 3, 4 again more carefully.

x=0: 0, as before, gives 0. So 0 is a root.

x=1: 1 +3 +1 +2 =7 mod5=2≠0.

x=2: 32 + 3*8 +4 +4=32+24+4+4=64 → 64 mod5: 5*12=60, 64-60=4. So 4≠0.

x=3: 3^5=243 mod5. Let's compute 3^5: 3^1=3, 3^2=9≡4, 3^3=12≡2, 3^4=6≡1, 3^5=3. So 3x^3: 3*(3^3)=3*2=6≡1. x^2=9≡4. 2x=6≡1. Sum:3+1+4+1=9≡4≠0.

x=4: 4^5=1024 mod5. Let's compute 4^5. Since 4^2=16≡1, 4^3=4*1=4, 4^4=4*4=16≡1, 4^5=4*1=4. So 3x^3=3*(4^3)=3*4=12≡2. x^2=16≡1. 2x=8≡3. Sum:4+2+1+3=10≡0.

So, yes, 4 is a root.

Wait, but earlier when I thought I made a mistake, maybe I confused the exponents. Let me check x=1 again. Maybe I should compute each term mod5 as I go.

x=1:

x^5:1^5=1 mod5=1.

3x^3:3*(1^3)=3*1=3 mod5=3.

x^2:1^2=1 mod5=1.

2x:2*1=2 mod5=2.

Adding them:1+3=4, +1=5, +2=7. 7 mod5=2≠0. So 1 is not a root.

So the roots are 0 and 4, which is option F.

Wait, but wait, maybe I should check if there are any other roots. Did I miss any?

Wait, let me check x=4 again. Yes, as above, it works. What about x=3? Did I compute that correctly? Let's try again.

x=3:

x^5:3^5 is 243. 243 divided by 5: 5*48=240, so 243-240=3. So x^5=3 mod5.

3x^3:3*(3^3)=3*(27)=81. 81 mod5: 5*16=80, so 81-80=1. So 3x^3=1.

x^2=9 mod5=4.

2x=6 mod5=1.

Sum:3+1=4, +4=8, +1=9. 9 mod5=4≠0. So 3 isn't a root.

x=2:

x^5=32 mod5=2.

3x^3=3*(8)=24 mod5=4.

x^2=4.

2x=4.

Sum:2+4=6, +4=10, +4=14. 14 mod5=4≠0.

So only 0 and 4 are roots.

Wait, but wait, the polynomial is x^5 +3x^3 +x^2 +2x. Maybe I can factor it to see if there are any other roots.

Let me factor x out: x(x^4 +3x^2 +x +2).

So x=0 is a root, as found.

Now, let's factor the quartic: x^4 +3x^2 +x +2.

Maybe factor it as (x^2 + a x + b)(x^2 + c x + d).

Let me try to factor it.

Looking for factors:

(x^2 + a x + b)(x^2 + c x + d) = x^4 + (a + c)x^3 + (ac + b + d)x^2 + (ad + bc)x + bd.

We need this to equal x^4 + 0x^3 +3x^2 +x +2.

So equating coefficients:

1. a + c = 0 (since x^3 coefficient is 0)
2. ac + b + d = 3
3. ad + bc =1
4. bd = 2

From equation 1: c = -a mod5.

So substituting c = -a into equation 2:

a*(-a) + b + d = -a² + b + d =3.

Equation 3: a d + b*(-a) = a d -a b = a (d -b) =1.

Equation 4: b*d=2 mod5.

Now, possible values for b and d such that b*d=2.

Possible pairs (b,d) in Z_5:

(1,2), (2,1), (3,4), (4,3), (0, ?) but 0 can't since 0* any is 0, not 2.

So try (1,2):

Then equation 3: a(d -b)=a*(2-1)=a*1 = a =1. So a=1.

From equation 1: c = -1.

From equation 2: -a² +b +d = -(1)^2 +1+2 =-1 +3=2. But equation 2 requires it to be 3. So 2≠3 mod5. So this doesn't work.

Next, try (b,d)=(2,1):

Equation 3: a*(1-2)=a*(-1)=a*4=1 mod5. So 4a=1 → a=4^{-1}=4 (since 4*4=16≡1 mod5). So a=4.

Then c=-4≡1 mod5.

Equation 2: -a² +b +d = -(16) +2+1 → 16 mod5 is 1, so -1 +3=2 mod5. But equation 2 requires 3. So 2≠3. Not good.

Next, (b,d)=(3,4):

Equation 3: a*(4-3)=a*1=1 → a=1.

c=-1.

Equation 2: -1 +3+4= -1 +7=6≡1 mod5. But equation 2 needs 3, so no.

Next, (b,d)=(4,3):

Equation3: a*(3-4)=a*(-1)=a*4=1 → a=4.

c= -4≡1.

Equation 2: -a² +b +d = -16 +4+3 → -1 +7=6≡1 mod5. Again, needs 3, so no.

Hmm, none of these worked. Maybe try (b,d)=(3,4) again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me try (b,d)=(3,4). Then equation 3: a*(4-3)=a*1=1 → a=1.

Then c=-1.

Equation 2: -1^2 +3+4= -1 +7=6≡1 mod5. But we need 3, so not good.

Another approach: Maybe the quartic doesn't factor into quadratics, so maybe it's irreducible. Then, the only roots are 0 and 4.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the factoring approach. Let me try evaluating the quartic at x=4.

x=4: x^4=4^4=256 mod5. 256/5=51*5=255, 256-255=1. So x^4=1.

3x^2=3*(16)=48 mod5=3*1=3.

x=4.

So sum:1 +3 +4 +2 =10 mod5=0. So x=4 is a root of the quartic as well.

Wait, but earlier when I factored out x, the quartic had x=4 as a root, so maybe I can perform polynomial division.

Wait, the quartic is x^4 +3x^2 +x +2. Let me check if x=4 is a root of this quartic.

x=4: x^4=256 mod5=1.

3x^2=3*(16)=48 mod5=3*(1)=3.

x=4 mod5=4.

So 1 +3 +4 +2 =10 mod5=0. So yes, x=4 is a root.

Therefore, (x-4) is a factor of the quartic. Let me perform the division.

Divide x^4 +3x^2 +x +2 by (x -4) in Z_5.

Using polynomial long division.

Alternatively, since we're in Z_5, maybe it's easier to write the quartic as (x -4)(x^3 + a x^2 + b x + c) and find a, b, c.

Expanding (x -4)(x^3 + a x^2 + b x + c) = x^4 + (a -4)x^3 + (b -4a)x^2 + (c -4b)x -4c.

Compare with the quartic x^4 +0x^3 +3x^2 +x +2.

So:

1. Coefficient of x^4: 1, matches.
2. x^3: a -4 ≡0 mod5 → a=4.
3. x^2: b -4a ≡3 → b -16 ≡3 → but 16 mod5=1, so b -1=3 → b=4.
4. x: c -4b ≡1 → c -16 ≡1 → 16 mod5=1, so c -1=1 → c=2.
5. Constant term: -4c ≡2 → -8c ≡2. Wait, no, I think I made a mistake. The constant term from expansion is -4c, and in the quartic it's +2.

So -4c ≡2 mod5 → multiply both sides by (-1): 4c ≡-2 ≡3 mod5. So 4c=3 → c=3*(4^{-1})=3*4=12≡2 mod5. So c=2. Which matches the earlier result.

So the quartic factors as (x-4)(x^3 +4x^2 +4x +2).

Now, let's check if this cubic has any roots in Z_5.

We can test x=0,1,2,3,4.

x=0: 0 +0 +0 +2=2≠0.

x=1:1 +4 +4 +2=11 mod5=1≠0.

x=2:8 +16 +8 +2=34 mod5=4≠0.

x=3:27 +36 +12 +2=77 mod5=77-15*5=77-75=2≡2≠0.

x=4:64 +64 +16 +2=146 mod5=146-29*5=146-145=1≠0.

So the cubic has no roots in Z_5, meaning it's irreducible over Z_5. Therefore, the quartic factors as (x-4)(irreducible cubic), so the only roots are 0 and 4.

Thus, the zeros are 0 and 4, which is option F.
</think>

The zeros of the polynomial \(x^5 + 3x^3 + x^2 + 2x\) in \(\mathbb{Z}_5\) are found by evaluating the polynomial at each element of \(\mathbb{Z}_5\) (0, 1, 2, 3, 4). 

- For \(x = 0\): The polynomial evaluates to 0, so 0 is a root.
- For \(x = 1\), \(x = 2\), and \(x = 3\): The polynomial does not evaluate to 0.
- For \(x = 4\): The polynomial evaluates to 0, so 4 is a root.

Factoring the polynomial as \(x(x^4 + 3x^2 + x + 2)\) confirms that 0 is a root. The quartic \(x^4 + 3x^2 + x + 2\) is further factored as \((x - 4)(x^3 + 4x^2 + 4x + 2)\), where \(x = 4\) is a root, and the cubic factor has no roots in \(\mathbb{Z}_5\). Thus, the only zeros are 0 and 4.
