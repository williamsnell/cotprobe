Okay, so I've got this problem about calculating the fundamental vibrational frequency of a molecule. Hmm, the molecule is Cl2, specifically ^35Cl^35Cl. The force constant given is 319 N·m⁻¹. I need to find the frequency in cm⁻¹ from the options provided.

Wait, I remember that the fundamental vibrational frequency is related to the force constant and the reduced mass of the molecule. The formula I think is ν = (1/(2π)) * sqrt(k/μ), where k is the force constant and μ is the reduced mass. But wait, sometimes I see it expressed in terms of wavenumbers (cm⁻¹), so maybe the formula uses a different constant.

Oh right, the wavenumber (tilde ν) is given by (1/(2πc)) * sqrt(k/μ), where c is the speed of light. But wait, another approach I've heard about involves using the formula in terms of the force constant and the bond length, but I don't have the bond length here. Alternatively, I think there's a simplified version because for diatomic molecules, the vibrational frequency can be calculated using k and the reduced mass.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to recall the exact formula. Oh yes, the vibrational frequency in wavenumbers (tilde ν) is given by sqrt(k/(4π²μ)) divided by c, but I'm mixing units here. Alternatively, the formula is tilde ν = (1/(2πc)) * sqrt(k/μ), where c is the speed of light in m/s.

Wait, no, maybe I should think in terms of the formula that directly gives the frequency in cm⁻¹. Let me think about the constants involved. Oh right, the formula is tilde ν = (1/(2πc)) * sqrt(k/μ), where c is the speed of light in cm/s. Because the units need to be consistent.

So I need to calculate μ, the reduced mass of the Cl2 molecule. Chlorine-35 has a molar mass of about 35 g/mol. So each Cl atom is 35 g/mol. But wait, the molar mass is 35 g/mol, which is 35e-3 kg/mol. But wait, to find the mass in kg, but actually, for reduced mass, I need each atom's mass in kg.

Wait, no, the reduced mass μ is (m1 * m2)/(m1 + m2). Since both are Cl-35, they're the same mass. So μ = (m * m)/(m + m) = m/2. So each Cl has a mass of 35 u (atomic mass units). Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck on the units here.

Let me get the molar mass right. The molar mass of Cl is approximately 35 g/mol. So the mass of one Cl atom is 35 g/mol divided by Avogadro's number, which is 6.022e23 mol⁻¹. So m = 35e-3 kg/mol / 6.022e23 mol⁻¹ = (35e-3)/(6.022e23) kg.

Wait, that's going to be a very small number. Let me compute that. 35e-3 is 0.035 kg/mol. Divided by 6.022e23 gives approximately 5.81e-26 kg per atom.

So each Cl atom is about 5.81e-26 kg. Then the reduced mass μ is (5.81e-26 kg * 5.81e-26 kg) / (5.81e-26 kg + 5.81e-26 kg) ). Wait, that's (m^2)/(2m) ) = m/2. So μ = 5.81e-26 kg / 2 ≈ 2.905e-26 kg.

Now, the force constant k is 319 N/m. Plugging into the formula, tilde ν = (1/(2πc)) * sqrt(k/μ). Let me compute this step by step.

First, compute sqrt(k/μ). So k is 319 N/m, μ is 2.905e-26 kg.

So k/μ = 319 / 2.905e-26 ≈ let's calculate that. 319 divided by 2.905e-26 is approximately 1.1e24 (since 319/3 is ~106, but 2.905e-26 is smaller, so 319/(3e-26) is about 1e24). Wait, wait, let me compute it more accurately.

319 / 2.905e-26 = 319 / 2.905 * 1e26 = approximately 109.75 * 1e26 = 1.0975e28 m²/s². Wait, no, wait, because N/m is kg/s², and μ is in kg, so k/μ is (kg/s²) / kg = 1/s². So sqrt(k/μ) is 1/s.

So sqrt(1.0975e28) = sqrt(1.0975) * 1e14 ≈ 1.0475 * 1e14 ≈ 1.0475e14 s⁻¹.

Now, 1/(2πc): c is the speed of light in cm/s, which is approximately 3e10 cm/s.

So 1/(2πc) = 1/(2 * π * 3e10) ≈ 1/(6e10 * 3.1416) ≈ 1/(1.88496e11) ≈ 5.29e-12 s/cm.

Now, multiplying this by sqrt(k/μ): 5.29e-12 s/cm * 1.0475e14 s⁻¹ = (5.29e-12 * 1.0475e14) cm⁻¹.

Calculating that: 5.29e-12 * 1.0475e14 = 5.29 * 1.0475 * 1e2 ≈ let's compute 5.29 * 1.0475 ≈ 5.29 * 1.05 ≈ 5.5545, then times 1e2 gives 555.45 cm⁻¹.

Looking at the options, option F is 556 cm⁻¹, which is very close to this value. So I think the correct answer is F.

To calculate the fundamental vibrational frequency (wavenumber) of the ${ }^{35} \mathrm{Cl}^{35} \mathrm{Cl}$ molecule, we use the formula:

\[
\tilde{\nu} = \frac{1}{2\pi c} \sqrt{\frac{k}{\mu}}
\]

where:
- \( k = 319 \, \mathrm{N \cdot m^{-1}} \) (force constant),
- \( c = 3 \times 10^{10} \, \mathrm{cm \cdot s^{-1}} \) (speed of light),
- \( \mu \) is the reduced mass of the molecule.

### Step 1: Calculate the reduced mass (\( \mu \))
The molar mass of chlorine-35 (\(^{35}\mathrm{Cl}\)) is \( 35 \, \mathrm{g \cdot mol^{-1}} \), which is \( 35 \times 10^{-3} \, \mathrm{kg \cdot mol^{-1}} \). The mass of a single \(^{35}\mathrm{Cl}\) atom is:

\[
m = \frac{35 \times 10^{-3} \, \mathrm{kg \cdot mol^{-1}}}{6.022 \times 10^{23} \, \mathrm{mol^{-1}}} \approx 5.81 \times 10^{-26} \, \mathrm{kg}
\]

Since the molecule consists of two identical \(^{35}\mathrm{Cl}\) atoms, the reduced mass is:

\[
\mu = \frac{m \cdot m}{m + m} = \frac{m}{2} = \frac{5.81 \times 10^{-26} \, \mathrm{kg}}{2} \approx 2.905 \times 10^{-26} \, \mathrm{kg}
\]

### Step 2: Compute \( \sqrt{\frac{k}{\mu}} \)
\[
\sqrt{\frac{k}{\mu}} = \sqrt{\frac{319 \, \mathrm{N \cdot m^{-1}}}{2.905 \times 10^{-26} \, \mathrm{kg}}} = \sqrt{\frac{319}{2.905 \times 10^{-26}}} \approx \sqrt{1.1 \times 10^{28}} \, \mathrm{s^{-1}} \approx 1.05 \times 10^{14} \, \mathrm{s^{-1}}
\]

### Step 3: Compute \( \frac{1}{2\pi c} \)
\[
\frac{1}{2\pi c} = \frac{1}{2 \cdot 3.1416 \cdot 3 \times 10^{10} \, \mathrm{cm \cdot s^{-1}}} \approx \frac{1}{1.885 \times 10^{11}} \approx 5.29 \times 10^{-12} \, \mathrm{s \cdot cm^{-1}}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate \( \tilde{\nu} \)
\[
\tilde{\nu} = \frac{1}{2\pi c} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{k}{\mu}} = (5.29 \times 10^{-12} \, \mathrm{s \cdot cm^{-1}}) \cdot (1.05 \times 10^{14} \, \mathrm{s^{-1}}) \approx 555 \, \mathrm{cm^{-1}}
\]

### Final Answer:
The calculated wavenumber is approximately \( 556 \, \mathrm{cm^{-1}} \), which corresponds to option **F**.
