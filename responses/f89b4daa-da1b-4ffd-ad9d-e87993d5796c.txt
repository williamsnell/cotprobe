Alright, so I've got this multiple-choice question about naturalists and their association with certain philosophical or religious schools. Let me try to work through it step by step.

The question is asking which group is associated with naturalists who focused on natural elements and processes. The options are from A to J, including various philosophies like Confucianism, Daoism, Vedic Philosophy, and others.

First, I need to understand what the term "naturalists" refers to in this context. Naturalists are people who study and are interested in natural elements and processes, so they might be looking at nature, natural phenomena, and how things work in the natural world.

Looking at the options, I should think about each one and what they emphasize.

Option A: Mengzi. I remember Mengzi is a school of thought in Chinese philosophy, often associated with Confucianism. Mengzi, the person, emphasized human nature and moral development, focusing more on ethics and social order rather than natural elements.

Option B: Zoroastrianism. This is a Persian religion that emphasizes a dualistic view of the world, with good and evil. It's more about cosmic forces and moral choices, not necessarily focused on natural processes in the way the question is phrased.

Option C: Zen Buddhism. Zen is a school of Buddhism that originated in China. It focuses on meditation, self-realization, and the nature of consciousness. While it does connect with the natural world in some ways, it's more about personal enlightenment and less about studying natural elements systematically.

Option D: Shintoism. This is the indigenous religion of Japan, focusing on kami (spirits) and the natural world. Shinto does emphasize nature and the spirits within it, but I'm not sure if it's about natural elements in the same way as the question implies. It's more about spiritual connection and rituals.

Option E: Vedic Philosophy. This comes from ancient India and forms the basis of Hinduism. It includes the Vedas, which are ancient texts about rituals, ceremonies, and the structure of the universe. Vedic Philosophy does deal with natural elements, like the elements of nature, but I'm not sure if it's the best fit here.

Option F: Humanistic Buddhism. This is a modern movement that focuses on the social and human aspects of Buddhism. It emphasizes compassion and helping others, but again, it's more about human and social issues than natural elements.

Option G: Confucianism. This is a Chinese philosophy focusing on ethics, morality, and social order. It's more about how humans should behave and create a harmonious society rather than studying nature.

Option H: Legalism. This was a political philosophy in China, emphasizing law and strict governance. It's more about governance and control rather than natural processes.

Option I: Yin-Yang School. This is also known as the School of Naturalists in Chinese philosophy. It focuses on the forces of yin and yang, which are the dualistic aspects of reality. They studied astronomy,气象 (weather), calendar systems, and other natural phenomena. This seems to align closely with the question's description.

Option J: Daoism. This is another Chinese philosophy that emphasizes the Dao, the way or path of the universe. Daoism does focus on natural processes and the flow of the universe, but it's more about living in harmony with the Dao rather than systematically studying natural elements. However, the Yin-Yang School is more directly associated with the study of natural elements.

So, putting it together, the Yin-Yang School (Option I) is the one that concentrated on natural elements and processes. They studied things like weather, natural cycles, and the interactions between yin and yang. Therefore, the correct answer should be I.

The correct answer is I: Yin-Yang School.
