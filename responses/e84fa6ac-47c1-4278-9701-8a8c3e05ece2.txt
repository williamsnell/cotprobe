Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about Hobbes and Locke, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me break it down.

The question is asking about the principal difference between their positions. The options are A to J, but here they're listed as A to D. So I need to consider each option carefully.

First, I remember that both Hobbes and Locke were political philosophers, and their main ideas revolve around the social contract theory. But their views on the state of nature and the role of government differ significantly.

Hobbes, as I recall, believed that in the state of nature, life was "solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short." He thought that people's lives were brutish and that without a strong government, society would descend into chaos. So he advocated for an absolute sovereign with unlimited power to enforce order.

On the other hand, Locke believed that in the state of nature, people were free and equal, but because they could make mistakes, they needed a government to protect their natural rights, like life, liberty, and property. He supported a more limited government that derives its authority from the consent of the governed.

Looking at the options:

A: Different attitudes towards the role of courts. I'm not sure about this. Both probably thought courts were important, but I don't know if this is the main difference.

B: Disagree about the role of law in society. Again, both might have views on law, but I'm not certain if this is the key difference.

C: Opposing views on contractual obligations. Contract theory is part of both, but I think the main difference is more about the state of nature and the extent of government power.

D: Differ in their account of life before the social contract. This sounds more accurate because Hobbes described a much more dangerous state of nature compared to Locke's relatively peaceful and cooperative one.

So the main difference is their view of life before the social contract. Hobbes saw it as bad, Locke as good, leading to different views on government's role.

The principal difference between Hobbes and Locke lies in their views on life before the social contract. Hobbes depicted it as brutish and chaotic, necessitating a strong, absolute government. Locke, however, saw it as peaceful and cooperative, advocating for a government that protects natural rights. 

Answer: D
