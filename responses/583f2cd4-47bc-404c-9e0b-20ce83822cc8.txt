Question:

 Use indirect truth tables to determine whether each set of propositions is consistent. If the set is consistent, choose an option with a consistent valuation. (There may be other consistent valuations.)
D ≡ E
F ∨ D
~E · ~F

Options:

A: Consistent. Consistent valuation when D and E are true and F is true
B: Inconsistent
C: Consistent. Consistent valuation when D is true, E and F are false
D: Consistent. Consistent valuation when E is true, D and F are false
E: Consistent. Consistent valuation when D and E are true and F is false
F: Consistent. Consistent valuation when D, E are false and F is true
G: Consistent. Consistent valuation when D and F are true and E is false
H: Consistent. Consistent valuation when D, E, and F are true
I: Consistent. Consistent valuation when F is true, D and E are false
J: Consistent. Consistent valuation when D, E and F are false

Okay, so I've got this logic problem here, and I need to figure out if the given set of propositions is consistent using indirect truth tables. The propositions are:

1. D ≡ E
2. F ∨ D
3. ~E · ~F

And the options are from A to J, each suggesting different valuations or inconsistency. Let me start by understanding what each proposition means.

First, D ≡ E is a biconditional, which means D and E are logically equivalent. So whenever D is true, E is also true, and whenever D is false, E is false.

Next, F ∨ D is a disjunction. This means that at least one of F or D must be true. So either F is true, D is true, or both are true.

Lastly, ~E · ~F is a conjunction of two negations. This means both E and F must be false for this proposition to hold true.

Now, the goal is to see if there's a way to assign truth values to D, E, and F such that all three propositions are true simultaneously. If such an assignment exists, the set is consistent; otherwise, it's inconsistent.

Let me try to construct a truth table, but since the question suggests using indirect truth tables, I might approach it by assuming the set is consistent and see if any contradictions arise.

Let's consider the propositions one by one.

From D ≡ E, if D is true, E must be true, and if D is false, E is false.

Now, looking at ~E · ~F: for this to be true, both E and F must be false. So E is false, and F is false.

If E is false (from ~E), then from D ≡ E, D must also be false because E is false. So D is false.

Now, considering F ∨ D: since D is false, F must be true for the disjunction to hold. But wait, from ~F, F is false. So F has to be both true and false at the same time? That can't happen.

Wait, that's a contradiction. Because from ~E · ~F, F must be false. But F ∨ D requires that if D is false, F must be true. So with D false, F needs to be true, but according to ~E · ~F, F is false. So F can't be both true and false at the same time. Therefore, there's no possible assignment where all three propositions are true. So the set is inconsistent.

Wait, but let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in the reasoning.

So, D ≡ E: D and E have the same truth value.

~E · ~F: E is false and F is false. So E is false, F is false.

From D ≡ E, since E is false, D is also false.

Now, F ∨ D: F is false and D is false, so F ∨ D is false. But the proposition is F ∨ D, which must be true in the set. So F ∨ D being false contradicts the second proposition, which requires it to be true.

So yes, that's a contradiction. Therefore, the set is inconsistent. Hence, the answer should be option B: Inconsistent.

The set of propositions is inconsistent because there's no possible truth assignment that satisfies all three propositions simultaneously.

Answer: B
