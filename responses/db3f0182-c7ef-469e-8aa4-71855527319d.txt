Question:

A general contractor about to bid on a construction job for an office building invited a carpenter and several others to bid on the carpentry work. The carpenter agreed to bid if the general contractor would agree to give the carpenter the job provided that his bid was lowest and the general contractor was awarded the main contract. The general contractor so agreed. The carpenter, incurring time and expense in preparing his bid, submitted the lowest carpentry bid. The general contractor used the carpenter's bid in calculating its own bid, which was successful. Which of the following best supports the carpenter's position that the general contractor is obligated to position that the general contractor is obligated to award the carpentry subcontract to the carpenter?

Options:

A: The general contractor has an obligation to the owner of the building to subcontract with the carpenter because the carpenter's bid was used in calculating the general contractor's bid, and the carpenter is an intended beneficiary of that obligation.
B: The carpenter detrimentally relied on the general contractor's conditional promise in preparing his bid.
C: The carpenter has the necessary skills and experience for the job, hence the general contractor should award the subcontract to him.
D: The carpenter has incurred time and expense in preparing his bid, which obligates the general contractor to award the subcontract.
E: The carpenter's bid was the lowest among all the bids, hence the general contractor is obligated to award the subcontract.
F: The general contractor and the carpenter had a verbal agreement, which obligates the general contractor to award the subcontract.
G: The general contractor's main bid was successful due to the carpenter's low bid, hence the carpenter should be awarded the subcontract.
H: The general contractor has an implied duty to deal fairly and in good faith with all bidders whose bids the general contractor used in calculating its main bid to the building owner.
I: The carpenter gave consideration for the general contractor's conditional promise to award the carpentry subcontract to the carpenter.
J: The carpenter has a legal claim to the subcontract because he was invited to bid by the general contractor.

Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the question is about a general contractor who invited a carpenter to bid on a part of the construction job. The carpenter agreed to bid only if the general contractor would give him the job if his bid was the lowest and the general contractor got the main contract. The general contractor agreed to that. Then the carpenter prepared his bid, which ended up being the lowest, and the general contractor used that bid to calculate their own, which was successful. Now, the question is, why does the carpenter think the general contractor must award him the subcontract?

Hmm, I need to pick the best option from A to J. Let's look at each option one by one.

Option A says the general contractor has an obligation to the owner to subcontract with the carpenter because his bid was used, and the carpenter is an intended beneficiary. Wait, but I think the obligation is between the general contractor and the carpenter, not necessarily to the owner. The owner isn't a party here, so maybe A isn't the best choice.

Option B: The carpenter relied on the general contractor's promise. He prepared his bid based on that. Reliance can create obligations, but I'm not sure if detrimentally relying is enough here without more, like consideration.

Option C: The carpenter has the skills, so he should get the job. But that's more of a reason for why he's qualified, not necessarily a legal obligation. It doesn't directly address the promise made.

Option D: He incurred costs, so he must get the subcontract. I think sometimes when you rely on a promise and incur costs, you can claim reliance damages, but does that mean the contractor must give him the job? Maybe, but I'm not sure if that's the strongest reason here.

Option E: His bid was the lowest, so he should get it. That makes sense, but wasn't the agreement that he would get it if his bid was the lowest and the general contractor got the main contract? So maybe E is part of the story, but the obligation is based on their agreement, not just being the lowest.

Option F: They had a verbal agreement. Well, yes, they did agree verbally, but the issue is whether that creates an obligation. But the carpenter might argue that the agreement was conditional, so F might not be the strongest.

Option G: The general contractor's success was due to the carpenter's low bid, so he should get the subcontract. That seems reasonable, but again, it's more about the agreement they made, not just the outcome.

Option H: The general contractor has a duty to deal fairly with all bidders whose bids they used. That sounds like a fairness argument. If the contractor used the carpenter's bid, maybe they have to deal fairly, like awarding the subcontract. This seems like a possible answer.

Option I: The carpenter gave consideration for the general contractor's promise. Consideration is needed for a contract. If the carpenter's bid was the consideration, then the promise becomes binding. So this could be a strong argument because without consideration, the promise might not be enforceable.

Option J: The carpenter was invited to bid, so he has a claim. But just being invited doesn't create an obligation. Many subcontractors are invited, but not all get the job. So J might not be the best.

Now, putting it together. The key is that the general contractor promised the carpenter the job if his bid was the lowest and the main contract was awarded. The carpenter relied on that by preparing his bid, which cost him time and money. So, did the carpenter provide consideration? If he did, then the promise is enforceable. In contract law, consideration requires a mutual exchange. Here, the carpenter's bid (and reliance) might count as consideration. So option I says the carpenter gave consideration, making the promise binding.

Alternatively, option H talks about a duty of good faith. But I think the consideration is a stronger point because without it, the promise might not be enforceable. So the best answer would be I because it directly addresses the consideration needed for the contract.

The carpenter can argue that he provided consideration by preparing his bid in reliance on the general contractor's promise. This makes the promise enforceable, obligating the general contractor to award the subcontract.
