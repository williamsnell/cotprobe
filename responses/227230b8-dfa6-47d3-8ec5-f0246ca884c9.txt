Okay, so I have this question about Piaget and his views on children. I'm a bit rusty on my developmental psychology, but I remember that Piaget had some specific ideas about how kids learn and think.

The question is asking what Piaget thought about children, and the options are A to J. Let's go through them one by one.

Option A: Unable to learn complex concepts. Hmm, I think Piaget actually believed that children can learn complex things, just not the same way adults do. He talked about stages of cognitive development, so this might not be right. Plus, I remember something about children being little scientists, which suggests they can grasp complex ideas through exploration.

Option B: “Blank slates”. That term makes me think of John Locke, not Piaget. Locke said people are born without any innate ideas, so the mind is a blank slate shaped by experience. Piaget, on the other hand, was more about the child actively constructing knowledge, so B might not be correct.

Option C: "Little artists". I don't recall Piaget using this term. He focused more on how children think and reason, not necessarily their artistic abilities. So probably not C.

Option D: “Little scientists”. Oh yeah, I think this is right. Piaget viewed children as miniature scientists who explore their world through trial and error, experiments, and by creating hypotheses. They learn by doing and interacting with their environment.

Option E: "Little philosophers". While children do think deeply, I don't think Piaget described them as philosophers. He was more about the process of learning and cognitive development stages.

Option F: Shaped by their environment only. Piaget didn't think it was just the environment. He believed in the interaction between the child and their environment, not that the environment solely shapes them. So F might be too narrow.

Option G: Shaped by culture. Again, Piaget's theory is broader than just culture. He emphasized the child's active role in understanding the world, not just cultural influences.

Option H: Less intelligent than adults. No, Piaget didn't see it that way. He thought children have their own form of intelligence that's appropriate for their developmental stage. So H is incorrect.

Option I: Just smaller versions of adults. Definitely not. Piaget's theory is all about stages of development, where each stage has distinct characteristics, so children aren't just smaller adults.

Option J: Influenced by genetics only. No, he believed in the interplay between genetic factors and the environment, not just one or the other.

So putting it all together, the correct answer seems to be D: “Little scientists”. Piaget's theory emphasizes the child's active role in exploring and understanding their environment, much like scientists do.

The correct answer is D: “Little scientists”. Piaget viewed children as actively exploring and understanding their world through a process similar to scientific inquiry.

Answer: D
