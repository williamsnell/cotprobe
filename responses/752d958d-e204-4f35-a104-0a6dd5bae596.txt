Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out how many liters of phosphine gas (PH3) can be made from 30 grams of calcium using the given reactions. Hmm, let's take it step by step.

First, I'll try to understand the reactions involved. The first reaction is between calcium (Ca) and phosphorus (P) to form calcium phosphide (Ca3P2). The balanced equation is 3Ca + 2P → Ca3P2. Then, the calcium phosphide reacts with hydrochloric acid (HCl) to produce phosphine gas (PH3) and calcium chloride (CaCl2). The second reaction is Ca3P2 + 6HCl → 2PH3 + 3CaCl2.

So, the overall process starts with calcium reacting with phosphorus to make Ca3P2, which then reacts with HCl to produce PH3. I think I should find out how much Ca3P2 is produced from 30 grams of Ca, and then use that to find out how much PH3 is made.

Let me jot down the steps I need to take:

1. Calculate moles of Ca from 30 grams.
2. Use the first reaction to find moles of Ca3P2 produced.
3. Use the second reaction to find moles of PH3 produced from the Ca3P2.
4. Convert moles of PH3 to liters using molar volume at STP.

Alright, starting with step 1. The molecular weight (molar mass) of Ca is given as 40 g/mol. So, moles of Ca = mass / molar mass = 30g / 40g/mol = 0.75 mol.

From the first reaction, the mole ratio between Ca and Ca3P2 is 3:1. That means for every 3 moles of Ca, we get 1 mole of Ca3P2. So, moles of Ca3P2 = moles of Ca / 3 = 0.75 mol / 3 = 0.25 mol.

Moving to step 3, the second reaction shows that 1 mole of Ca3P2 produces 2 moles of PH3. So, moles of PH3 = 0.25 mol * 2 = 0.5 mol.

Now, step 4: converting moles to liters at STP. I remember that at STP, 1 mole of any gas occupies 22.4 liters. So, liters of PH3 = 0.5 mol * 22.4 L/mol = 11.2 L.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is 11.2 L. So that's the answer. But wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Wait, another thought: Do I need to consider the availability of other reactants, like P and HCl? The problem states that the sequence of reactions is used, but doesn't specify if the amounts are sufficient. Since it's a problem, I think we can assume they are in excess, so the limiting reagent is Ca.

Yes, I think my calculation is correct. So the answer should be 11.2 liters, which is option A.

The process involves two reactions where calcium reacts with phosphorus to form calcium phosphide, which then reacts with hydrochloric acid to produce phosphine gas. Starting with 30 grams of calcium, the moles of calcium are calculated as 0.75 mol. Using the mole ratio from the first reaction, 0.25 mol of calcium phosphide is produced. This reacts in the second reaction to yield 0.5 mol of phosphine. At STP, 0.5 mol of PH3 corresponds to 11.2 liters.

Answer: A
