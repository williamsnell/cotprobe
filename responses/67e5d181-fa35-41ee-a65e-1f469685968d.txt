Okay, so I've got this chemistry question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me think through it step by step. The question is about what precipitate forms when a diabetic's urine is added to Fehling's solution and then heated.

First, I remember that Fehling's solution is used to test for reducing sugars, like glucose. Diabetic urine has higher levels of glucose because the body can't process it properly, so the urine would contain some sugar. So when the analyst adds the urine to Fehling's solution, if there's a reducing sugar present, a reaction should occur upon heating.

I think Fehling's solution contains copper ions, specifically Cu(II), in a sodium hydroxide solution. The exact composition might include things like sodium hydroxide, copper sulfate, and maybe another component like sodium potassium tartrate to keep the copper in solution without precipitating immediately.

When a reducing sugar is added, like glucose, and the solution is heated, the conditions are such that the copper ions are reduced. I remember that in such reactions, the copper is reduced from Cu(II) to Cu(I), and this forms a precipitate. The common product I think is something like copper(I) oxide, which is Cu₂O. I've heard it called "cuprous oxide," which is a brick-red precipitate.

Wait, but what about other copper compounds? Let me think. When you heat Fehling's solution with a reducing sugar, it forms a precipitate. I'm pretty sure Cu₂O is the right answer here. Other copper compounds like CuO (copper(II) oxide) are usually formed under different conditions, maybe with stronger oxidizing agents or different pH conditions.

Looking at the options, option A is Cu₂O. The other options don't seem right. For example, option C is CuO, which is a black precipitate, not red. Option J is CuSO4, which is a blue solution, not a precipitate. Option E is CuOH, which I think is a basic copper hydroxide, but I'm not sure if that's what forms here. 

So putting it all together, the reaction between Fehling's solution and a reducing sugar like glucose upon heating should produce Cu₂O as a precipitate. That's the red precipitate they're asking about.

The reaction involves Fehling's solution, which contains Cu(II) ions, and a reducing sugar like glucose from diabetic urine. Upon heating, the glucose reduces Cu(II) to Cu(I), forming a brick-red precipitate of Cu₂O.
