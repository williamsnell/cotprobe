Okay, so I have this question about conflict models and integration models regarding the tensions they emphasize. The question is asking what each model focuses on. Let me think about what I remember from my studies.

Conflict models, I think, are about how different groups within a society compete for resources or power. So they probably emphasize internal tensions, like between different parts of the state or society. On the other hand, integration models might focus on bringing different groups together, maybe from outside, so they might look at external tensions.

Looking at the options:

A: external; extrafamilial
B: interfamilial; extrafamilial
C: religious; military
D: internal; intrafamilial
E: external; internal
F: internal; external
G: socioeconomic; political
H: political; economical
I: extrafamilial; interfamilial
J: military; religious

Wait, the question says conflict models emphasize the importance of __ tensions, while integration models emphasize ____. So first blank is conflict, second is integration.

Conflict models: internal tensions because they're about conflict within the state or society.

Integration models: maybe external tensions because they're about integrating different parts, perhaps from outside.

So looking at the options, F says internal; external. That would fit. Conflict models focus on internal tensions, integration on external.

Wait, but I should double-check. Integration models, like systems theory, might look at how different subsystems (e.g., economy, politics, family) integrate, which could involve both internal and external factors. But the question is about the emphasis. I think integration models focus on bringing together different aspects, perhaps from within the society, but maybe the question is about external vs internal. Alternatively, maybe internal refers to within the family, but that seems less likely because the models are about state societies.

Wait, the options also have terms like 'intrafamilial' and 'extrafamilial.' Oh, maybe the question is using family-related terms. So, conflict models might focus on internal family tensions (intrafamilial), while integration models focus on external, like outside the family (extrafamilial). But that doesn't fit with state societies.

Wait, no, the question is about state societies, so maybe the terms are broader. Conflict models are about internal conflicts within the state, while integration models are about integrating with external groups, like other states or external influences.

So F: internal; external. That makes sense. Conflict models emphasize internal tensions, integration focuses on external.

Wait, but another thought: Integration models might actually focus on bringing different parts of the same society together, so internal. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the models are about the state's internal versus external relations.

Alternatively, maybe the question is using the terms differently. Let me think of the models. Conflict models, like those in political science, focus on internal power struggles. Integration models might focus on how the state integrates with other states, so external. So the answer would be F: internal; external.

The conflict models emphasize internal tensions within state societies, focusing on competition and struggle among different groups or subsystems. In contrast, integration models emphasize external tensions, as they focus on the process of bringing together diverse elements, often from outside the state or across different societies. 

The correct answer is **F: internal; external**.

Answer: F
