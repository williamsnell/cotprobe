Okay, let's try to figure out this economics question. So, the question is about the three basic reasons people hold money: transactions, precautionary, and speculative purposes. I need to determine which is most important for three different people.

First, the three motives are:
a) Transactions purposes: This is about holding money for daily expenses and transactions. People need money to buy things regularly, so they keep some cash for that.
b) Precautionary purposes: This is about saving money for emergencies or unexpected events. It's like an insurance policy in case something bad happens.
c) Speculative purposes: This is holding money to invest or speculate, hoping to make a profit from changes in the value of money or other assets.

Now, the three people are:
i) A student on a small allowance from his parents.
ii) A financially conservative professor with young children to support.
iii) A "wheeler-dealer" (which I think means someone who's good at business, maybe a trader or someone who deals in speculative activities).

Let's break them down one by one.

Starting with i) the student. Since he's on a small allowance, he probably needs money for regular expenses like food, books, maybe some entertainment. He doesn't have a lot of money, so his main concern is probably having enough for daily needs. So, the most important reason would be transactions purposes. He's not likely to save much for emergencies because he might not have the funds, and as a student, he's probably not speculating much unless he's trading stocks, which I don't think is the case here. So, transactions are the main motive.

Next, ii) the financially conservative professor with young children. Being conservative, he probably doesn't take big risks. He might save money for emergencies, like unexpected expenses for his kids or medical issues. Also, as a parent, he might need to ensure he has enough savings for their future, like education. So, precautionary motives would be important. He's not likely to speculate because he's conservative, so he's more about safety and savings.

Then, iii) the wheeler-dealer. This person is probably involved in business deals, trading, or investing. They might hold money to take advantage of investment opportunities, expecting to make a profit. So, their main motive would be speculative purposes. They might not need much for transactions since they might be handling larger sums, and precautionary might be less because they might be more confident in their abilities, but the main reason is to speculate.

Now, looking at the options, I need to match each person to their main motive.

i) Student: Transactions
ii) Professor: Precautionary
iii) Wheeler-dealer: Speculative

Looking at the options, option E says:
i) Transactions, ii) Precautionary, iii) Speculative. That's exactly what I thought. So the answer should be E.
</think>

The correct answer is E: i) Transactions purposes, ii) Precautionary reasons, iii) Speculative purposes.

i) The student primarily holds money for transactions to cover daily expenses.  
ii) The conservative professor prioritizes precautionary savings for emergencies and family needs.  
iii) The wheeler-dealer holds money for speculative purposes to invest and profit.  

Answer: E
