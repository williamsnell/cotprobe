Okay, so I've got this question about the order of the element 5 in U_8. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on group theory, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

First, I remember that U_n is the group of units modulo n. That means it's the set of integers less than n that are coprime to n, with multiplication modulo n as the operation. So U_8 would consist of numbers that are relatively prime to 8. Let me list them out: 1, 3, 5, 7. Yep, those are the numbers less than 8 that don't share any factors with 8 except 1.

Now, the question is about the order of the element 5 in this group. The order of an element is the smallest positive integer k such that 5^k ≡ 1 mod 8. So I need to find the smallest k where when I raise 5 to the power k and divide by 8, the remainder is 1.

Let me start calculating powers of 5 modulo 8:

- 5^1 mod 8: 5. That's just 5, not 1.
- 5^2 = 25. 25 divided by 8 is 3 with remainder 1, because 8*3=24 and 25-24=1. So 25 mod 8 is 1.

Wait, that's interesting. So 5 squared is congruent to 1 mod 8. So the order of 5 is 2? Let me double-check to make sure I'm not making a mistake.

Wait, maybe I should write down the steps again:

5^1 = 5 → 5 mod 8 =5 ≠1.

5^2 = 25 → 25 ÷8=3, remainder 1. So yes, 25 mod8=1.

So the smallest k is 2, which would make the order of 5 equal to 2. Looking back at the options, option F is 2. So I think the answer is F.

But wait, I should make sure I'm not missing anything. Let me think again. U_8 has φ(8) elements. φ(8) is Euler's totient function, and since 8 is 2^3, φ(8)=8*(1-1/2)=4. So U_8 has 4 elements: {1,3,5,7}.

The order of an element must divide the order of the group. The group order is 4, so possible orders are 1,2,4.

For 5, as I saw, 5^2 ≡1 mod8, so the order can't be 4 because 5^2 is already 1. So the order is 2.

Wait, but let me check another way. Maybe using properties of exponents modulo 8.

I know that 5 is congruent to -3 mod8 because 5 +3=8. So 5 ≡ -3 mod8.

So 5^2 ≡ (-3)^2 =9≡1 mod8. Yep, same result.

So yeah, the order is 2. So the answer is F.

The order of 5 in U_8 is 2 because 5² ≡ 1 mod 8.

Answer: F
