Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about blackbody radiation, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me start by recalling what I know.

The question is about the wavelength at which the spectral emissive power of a blackbody is maximum. I remember that there's a law related to this, probably Wien's displacement law. From what I recall, Wien's law states that the wavelength where the emission is maximum is inversely proportional to the temperature of the blackbody. The formula, if I'm not mistaken, is λ_max * T = constant. I think that constant is around 2.9×10^-3 m·K. 

So, the formula should be λ_max = (2.9×10^-3 m·K) / T. Let me double-check that. Yeah, I'm pretty sure it's λ_max * T = 2.9×10^-3 m·K. That makes sense because higher temperatures should correspond to shorter wavelengths for maximum emission, which aligns with the idea of hotter objects emitting more towards the blue end of the spectrum.

Now, looking at the question, it's divided into three parts: a, b, and c.

Part a: Temperature is 500 K. Using the formula, λ_max = 2.9e-3 m·K / 500 K. Let me calculate that. 2.9e-3 divided by 500 is 0.0000058 meters. Wait, 0.0000058 m is 5.8e-6 meters, which is 5,800 nanometers or 5,800 nm. Wait, but the options are in micrometers (mμ), right? Oh wait, 1 micrometer is 1e-6 meters. So 5.8e-6 m is 5.8 micrometers. Looking at the options, I don't see 5.8 mμ in any of the a parts. Wait, checking the options again.

Option C: a) 579 mμ. That's 579 micrometers, which is 579,000 nm, way too long. That can't be right for 500 K. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in calculation. Wait, 2.9e-3 / 500 is 0.0000058 m, which is 5.8 micrometers, not 579. So perhaps I miscalculated. Or maybe I confused the exponents.

Wait, 2.9e-3 is 0.0029 m·K. Divided by 500 K: 0.0029 / 500 = 0.0000058 m, which is 5.8 micrometers. So 5.8 mμ, which is 5800 nm. But looking at the options, none of the a parts have 5.8 mμ. Let me check the options again.

Option I: a) 5794 mμ, which is 5794 micrometers, way too high. Option C: a) 579 mμ, which is about 580 micrometers. Hmm, that's way too high for 500 K. Wait, maybe I mixed up the calculation. Let me think again. Oh wait, wait! 2.9e-3 m·K divided by 500 K is 0.0000058 m, which is 5.8 micrometers. So 5.8 mμ. But looking at the options, I don't see that. Wait, perhaps I should check other options.

Looking at option C: part a is 579 mμ, which is 579 micrometers. That's way too big. For 500 K, that would imply λ_max is about 5.8 micrometers, so perhaps I'm missing something. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the formula. Wait, Wien's law is λ_max * T = 2.9e-3 m·K, right? So for part a, T=500 K, λ_max = 2.9e-3 / 500 = 5.8e-6 m = 5.8 micrometers. So 5.8 mμ. But the options don't have that. Hmm, maybe I'm looking at the options incorrectly.

Wait, let me check each option's a part:

Option A: a) 500 mμ → 500 micrometers. That's 500,000 nm. No, way too high for 500 K.

Option B: a) 800 mμ → 800 micrometers. Also way too high.

Option C: a) 579 mμ → 579 micrometers. Still too high.

Option D: a) 600 mμ → 600 micrometers.

Option E: a) 555 mμ → 555 micrometers.

Option F: a) 5000 mμ → 5000 micrometers, which is 5 mm. No, that's way too long.

Option G: a) 1000 mμ → 1000 micrometers, which is 1 mm. No.

Option H: a) 720 mμ → 720 micrometers.

Option I: a) 5794 mμ → 5794 micrometers, which is like 5.794 mm. No.

Option J: a) 2940 mμ → 2940 micrometers. Still too long.

Wait, none of the options for part a match 5.8 mμ. That's strange. Maybe I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the options have a typo, but that's unlikely. Let me think again. Wait, perhaps I'm confusing nanometers and micrometers. Wait, 5.8 micrometers is 5800 nm, which is in the infrared range. But the options don't have that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should check part b first, maybe that will give me a clue. Part b is 5000 K. Using the same formula: λ_max = 2.9e-3 / 5000 = 0.00000058 m, which is 0.58 micrometers or 580 nm. That's in the visible range, green perhaps. So looking at the options, which part b gives 580 nm or 0.58 micrometers?

Looking at the options:

Option C: b) 5794 mμ → 5794 micrometers. No, way too big. Wait, 0.58 micrometers is 580 nm, which is 0.58 mμ. Looking for part b values around 0.58 mμ.

Looking at the options:

Option C: b) 5794 mμ → no.

Option I: b) 579.4 mμ → that's 579.4 micrometers. No, that's way too big.

Option E: b) 5550 mμ → no.

Option J: b) 294 mμ → 294 micrometers. No.

Option H: b)7200 mμ → no.

Wait, none of the options have a part b of 0.58 mμ. Hmm. That's odd. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Oh wait! I think I see the problem. Maybe the options are written with the decimal point misplaced. For example, option I has a) 5794 mμ and b) 579.4 mμ. Wait, but 579.4 mμ is 579,400 nm, which is 579.4 micrometers. That's way too long for 5000 K. Wait, but according to my calculation, for 5000 K, λ_max is 0.58 mμ (580 nm). So none of the options have that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should check another approach. Maybe the options are using a different value for the constant. Oh, wait, sometimes the constant is given as 2.898×10^-3 m·K instead of 2.9×10^-3. But that's a minor difference. Let me recalculate with 2.898e-3.

For part a: 2.898e-3 / 500 = 0.000005796 m → 5.796 micrometers, which is about 5.8 mμ, same as before. So no match in options.

For part b: 2.898e-3 / 5000 = 0.0000005796 m → 0.5796 micrometers, which is 579.6 nm. Wait, that's 0.5796 micrometers, but the options don't have that. Wait, looking at option C: part b is 5794 mμ. No, that's way too big. Option I: part b is 579.4 mμ, which is 579,400 nm. No, that's way off.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in units. Let me think again. The formula gives λ_max in meters, but perhaps the options are in micrometers, so I need to convert. For part a, 0.0000058 m is 5.8 micrometers. So 5.8 mμ. Looking again, none of the options have that for part a. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should look at part c. Part c asks for the temperature when the maximum is at 555 micrometers (555 mμ), which is 555,000 nm. Using the formula, T = (2.9e-3 m·K) / λ_max. So λ_max is 555e-6 m. So T = 2.9e-3 / (555e-6) = 2.9e-3 / 5.55e-4 = let's calculate that. 2.9 / 5.55 is approximately 0.522. Then, 0.522 * 1e3 = 522 K? Wait, no, because 2.9e-3 is 0.0029, and 555e-6 is 0.000555. So 0.0029 / 0.000555 ≈ 5.222 K? No, that can't be right. Wait, let me compute it properly.

Wait, 2.9e-3 divided by 555e-6 is the same as (2.9 / 555) * (1e-3 / 1e-6) → (2.9/555) * 1e3. Let me compute 2.9 / 555. 555 is approximately 5.55 x 10^2. So 2.9 / 555 ≈ 0.005222. Then, 0.005222 * 1e3 = 5.222 K. That can't be right because 555 micrometers is in the infrared, which corresponds to a temperature lower than room temperature. Wait, but 5.2 K is extremely cold, which doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculation.

Wait, let me compute it again. λ_max is 555 mμ = 555 x 1e-6 m = 5.55e-4 m. So T = (2.9e-3) / (5.55e-4) = (2.9 / 5.55) * (1e-3 / 1e-4) → 2.9 / 5.55 is approximately 0.522. Then, 0.522 * 10 = 5.22 K. Wait, that can't be right. That would imply that the maximum is at 555 micrometers for a temperature of about 5.2 K. But that's way too cold. Alternatively, I might have messed up the exponents.

Wait, wait, 5.55e-4 meters is 0.000555 meters. 2.9e-3 is 0.0029. So 0.0029 / 0.000555 = let's compute that: 0.0029 ÷ 0.000555. Let's divide numerator and denominator by 0.000001: 2900 ÷ 555 ≈ 5.222. So T ≈ 5.222 K. That's extremely cold, like near absolute zero. That doesn't make sense for 555 mμ. Wait, perhaps the question is about 555 nm, not micrometers. Oh wait, that's a possibility! Because 555 nm is in the visible range, around green light. But the question says 555 mμ, which is 555,000 nm, way into infrared. So maybe I misread the question. Let me check again.

The question says: c) At what temperature does the maximum spectral emittance lie at a wavelength of 555m\mu, where the eye is most sensitive? Wait, 555 micrometers is 555,000 nm, which is in the infrared. The human eye is most sensitive around 555 nm, which is green. So perhaps the question has a typo, but I'll proceed as written.

So according to this, part c would require T ≈ 5.2 K, but looking at the options for part c:

Option A: c) 2000 °K → too high.

Option B: c)4500 K → way too high.

Option C: c)5000 K → way too high.

Option D: c)3500 K → too high.

Option E: c)5555 K → way too high.

Option F: c)555 K → 555 K. Let me compute that. If T=555 K, λ_max = 2.9e-3 / 555 ≈ 5.22e-6 m = 5.22 micrometers. But the question says 555 micrometers, which would require T≈5.2 K. None of the options have c) around 5 K. So perhaps I'm making a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the question intended 555 nm, not micrometers.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that maybe the options have a mistake, but the correct approach is to proceed with the given data. So let's see.

Alternatively, perhaps the options have a different approach. Let's look at option I: a) 5794 mμ, b)579.4 mμ, c)5220 K.

Wait, part a of option I is 5794 mμ, which would correspond to T = 2.9e-3 / 5794e-6 = 2.9e-3 / 5.794e-4 ≈ 5.007 K. That's way too low for part a, which is 500 K. So that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I should consider if the options are using a different constant, like 3e-3 instead of 2.9e-3. Let's try that.

For part a, 3e-3 / 500 = 0.000006 m → 6 micrometers. Still, none of the options have that for part a, except maybe none.

Wait, looking at option I: part a is 5794 mμ. That would imply T = 3e-3 / 5794e-6 ≈ 5.18 K. Not matching 500 K.

Hmm, perhaps I should look for which option's a and b parts fit the formula correctly. Let's see:

Option C: a)579 mμ, b)5794 mμ.

For a) 579 mμ = 579e-6 m. So T = 2.9e-3 / 579e-6 = (2.9 / 579) * 1e3 ≈ (0.00499) * 1e3 ≈ 4.99 K. That's way too low for part a's temperature of 500 K. So option C is out.

Option I: a)5794 mμ → T=2.9e-3 /5794e-6≈0.5007 K. No, way too low.

Option E: a)555 mμ → T=2.9e-3 /555e-6≈5.22 K. Not matching 500 K.

Wait, this is getting confusing. Maybe I should look for which option's part a and b are calculated correctly. Let's check each option:

Option A: a)500 mμ → T=2.9e-3 /500e-6 = 5.8 K. Not 500 K. So a) is wrong.

Option B: a)800 mμ → T=2.9e-3 /800e-6≈3.625 K. No.

Option C: a)579 mμ → T≈5.00 K. No.

Option D: a)600 mμ → T≈4.83 K. No.

Option E: a)555 mμ → T≈5.22 K. No.

Option F: a)5000 mμ → T=2.9e-3/5000e-6=0.58 K. No.

Option G: a)1000 mμ → T≈2.9 K. No.

Option H: a)720 mμ → T≈4.027 K. No.

Option I: a)5794 mμ → T≈0.5007 K. No.

Option J: a)2940 mμ → T=2.9e-3/(2940e-6)=2.9e-3/2.94e-3≈0.986 K. No.

Wait, none of the options have the correct part a. That's odd. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Alternatively, perhaps the options have a typo, and part a is 500 K, but the wavelength is 579 nm instead of micrometers. Let me check option C again: part a is 579 mμ, but 579 nm would be 0.579 micrometers. Oh wait, perhaps the options have a mistake in units. Suppose part a is 579 nm (which is 0.579 micrometers). Then T would be 2.9e-3 / 0.579e-6 ≈ 5000 K. But that's not matching the given temperature of 500 K.

Wait, perhaps the options are in nanometers but written as micrometers. Let me check. For example, option I: a)5794 mμ is 5794 micrometers, which is 5794,000 nm. That's way too big. But if it's 5794 nm, that's 5.794 micrometers. Let me compute that: T=2.9e-3 /5.794e-6 ≈ 500 K. Because 5.794e-6 m is 5794 nm. So 2.9e-3 /5.794e-6 = approx 500 K. So that would make sense.

Wait, that's a possibility. So perhaps the options are written with a decimal point error. So option I: a)5794 mμ would actually be 5794 nm, which is 5.794 micrometers. Then, for T=500 K, λ_max would be 2.9e-3 /500 = 5.8e-6 m = 5,800 nm. So 5,800 nm is 5.8 micrometers. But option I's a is 5794 mμ, which would be 5794 nm. Close enough to 5,800 nm. So perhaps that's the intended answer.

Similarly, for part b: temperature 5000 K. λ_max = 2.9e-3 /5000 = 5.8e-7 m = 580 nm, which is 0.58 micrometers. Option I's part b is 579.4 mμ, which is 579,400 nm. That's way off. Wait, no, that's not right. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps part b is 579.4 nm, which is 0.5794 micrometers. Then, T=2.9e-3 /579.4e-9 = approx 5000 K. Let's compute that: 2.9e-3 m·K /579.4e-9 m = (2.9 /579.4) *1e6 ≈ (0.004996) *1e6 ≈ 4,996 K, which is close to 5000 K. So if part b is 579.4 nm, then it's correct. But the option says 579.4 mμ, which is 579.4 micrometers, which is way too big. So perhaps the options have a typo, and parts a and b are in nanometers but written as micrometers. So, in that case, for part a, 5794 nm would be 5.794 micrometers, which is 5.794 mμ. Wait, but option I says a)5794 mμ, which is 5794 micrometers, way too big.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is I, but with a different interpretation. Let's think again. If the options have a typo and part a is 5794 nm, which is 5.794 micrometers, then T=2.9e-3 /5.794e-6 ≈ 500 K. That matches part a. For part b, 5000 K, λ_max=580 nm, which is 0.58 micrometers. Looking at option I's part b, it's 579.4 mμ → 579.4 micrometers, which is 579,400 nm. That's way too big. So that can't be right. So maybe the correct answer is option I, but with parts a and b correctly interpreted as nanometers, but the options have a typo. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.

Wait, perhaps I should look for which option's part c matches 555 mμ. So part c is 555 mμ. Using the formula, T=2.9e-3 /555e-6 ≈ 5.22 K. But none of the options have c) around 5 K. The closest is option J: c)6500 K. No, that's way higher. Option I: c)5220 K. Let me compute that: λ_max=2.9e-3 /5220 ≈ 5.55e-7 m → 555 nm. Wait, that's 555 nm, which is 0.555 micrometers, not 555 mμ. So if part c is 555 nm, then the temperature would be 5220 K. So option I's c) is 5220 K. That would correspond to λ_max at 555 nm. But the question says 555 mμ, which is 555,000 nm. So that's a big discrepancy.

Wait, perhaps the question intended 555 nm for part c, not micrometers. Then, T=5220 K, which matches option I's c)5220 K.

Putting it all together, if the options have a typo and parts a and b are intended to be in nanometers, then:

a)500 K → λ_max ≈5.8 micrometers → 5800 nm. Option I's a is 5794 mμ → 5794 nm. Close enough.

b)5000 K → λ_max≈580 nm. Option I's b is 579.4 mμ → 579400 nm. No, that's way off. So perhaps another option.

Wait, option C: a)579 mμ → 579,000 nm, which is way too big. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option I, because part c matches 5220 K for 555 nm, even though the question says 555 mμ. Maybe it's a mistake in the question.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the options are correct as written, and I'm miscalculating.

Wait, let's try part c again. If the maximum is at 555 mμ, then T=2.9e-3 /555e-6 = approx 5.22 K. None of the options have that. So perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but that's unlikely. So perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express the formula. The wavelength is in micrometers, so maybe I should use the constant in micrometers. Wait, 2.9e-3 m·K is 2900 micrometers·K. So λ_max (in micrometers) = 2900 / T(K). So for part a, T=500 K: λ_max=2900/500=5.8 micrometers. So 5.8 mμ. Looking for part a of 5.8 mμ. None of the options have that. So perhaps the correct answer isn't present, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I should look for the option where a) is around 5.8 mμ, but none match.

Wait, perhaps I should check each option's a and b parts using this formula.

Option I: a)5794 mμ → T=2900/5794≈0.5007 K. No.

Option C: a)579 mμ → T=2900/579≈5.015 K. No.

Option E: a)555 mμ → T=2900/555≈5.225 K. No.

So none of the options have part a correct. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the options are in nanometers, but written as micrometers. So for part a, 500 K: λ_max=5.8 micrometers, which is 5800 nm. So looking for 5800 nm in the options. Option I: a)5794 mμ → 5794 nm. Close enough. So perhaps the options have a typo, and the intended answer is I, with a)5794 nm (5.794 mμ), b)579.4 nm (0.5794 mμ), and c)5220 K.

So in that case:

a) T=500 K → λ_max=5.8 mμ (5800 nm). Option I's a is 5794 mμ, which is 5794 nm, very close.

b) T=5000 K → λ_max=0.58 mμ (580 nm). Option I's b is 579.4 mμ, which is 579,400 nm. No, that's way off. Alternatively, perhaps part b is 579.4 nm, which is 0.5794 mμ. So T=2900/0.5794≈5007 K. Close to 5000 K. So option I's part b would be correct if it's 579.4 nm, but the option says 579.4 mμ. So perhaps the options have a typo, and the correct answer is option I.

The question involves determining the wavelength at which the spectral emissive power of a blackbody is maximum for given temperatures, using Wien's displacement law: 

\[
\lambda_{\text{max}} \cdot T = 2.9 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{m·K}.
\]

### Analysis:

1. **Part a: Temperature \( T = 500 \, \text{K} \)**
   - Using the formula: 
     \[
     \lambda_{\text{max}} = \frac{2.9 \times 10^{-3}}{500} = 5.8 \, \mu\text{m}.
     \]
   - None of the options directly match \( 5.8 \, \mu\text{m} \). However, option **I** lists \( a) \, 5794 \, \mu\text{m} \), which is close to \( 5.8 \, \mu\text{m} \) if interpreted as \( 5794 \, \text{nm} \) (a possible typo in units).

2. **Part b: Temperature \( T = 5000 \, \text{K} \)**
   - Using the formula: 
     \[
     \lambda_{\text{max}} = \frac{2.9 \times 10^{-3}}{5000} = 0.58 \, \mu\text{m}.
     \]
   - None of the options directly match \( 0.58 \, \mu\text{m} \). However, option **I** lists \( b) \, 579.4 \, \mu\text{m} \), which is close to \( 0.58 \, \mu\text{m} \) if interpreted as \( 579.4 \, \text{nm} \) (another possible typo in units).

3. **Part c: Wavelength \( \lambda_{\text{max}} = 555 \, \mu\text{m} \)**
   - Using the formula: 
     \[
     T = \frac{2.9 \times 10^{-3}}{555 \times 10^{-6}} \approx 5.22 \, \text{K}.
     \]
   - This result is inconsistent with the options provided. However, if the question intended \( \lambda_{\text{max}} = 555 \, \text{nm} \) (a likely typo), then:
     \[
     T = \frac{2.9 \times 10^{-3}}{555 \times 10^{-9}} \approx 5220 \, \text{K}.
     \]
   - This matches option **I**'s \( c) \, 5220 \, \text{K} \).

### Conclusion:
Given the potential typos in the options and the matches for parts a, b, and c when units are interpreted correctly, the best answer is **I**.

**Answer: I**
