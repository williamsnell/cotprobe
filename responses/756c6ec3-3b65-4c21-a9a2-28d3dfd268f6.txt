Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem in front of me, and I'm going to try to work through it step by step. The question is about estimating the standard reaction Gibbs energy for the formation of ammonia at 500 K. Hmm, I remember that Gibbs free energy change (ΔG°) is related to the standard enthalpy change (ΔH°) and the standard entropy change (ΔS°) through the equation ΔG° = ΔH° - TΔS°. Right, that's the formula I'll need to use.

First, I need to find the values of ΔH° and ΔS° for the reaction N2(g) + 3H2(g) → 2NH3(g). Wait, but wait, isn't this the formation reaction of ammonia? I think the standard values for ΔHf° (enthalpy of formation) and ΔSf° (entropy of formation) are usually given for such reactions. But wait, the problem says to assume all gases are perfect and data refers to 298 K unless stated. So I probably need to use the standard values at 298 K and then adjust for the temperature change to 500 K.

Wait, but wait, no, actually, the standard Gibbs energy is typically given at 298 K. But since the reaction is at 500 K, I might need to calculate ΔG at that temperature using the ΔH and ΔS at 298 K, assuming their values don't change much with temperature (which they do, but maybe the problem expects us to use the 298 K values for both ΔH and ΔS and apply them at 500 K).

So, first, let me get the standard enthalpy change (ΔH°) for the reaction. The standard enthalpy of formation (ΔHf°) for NH3 is known. I think it's about -46 kJ/mol, but wait, wait, sometimes the units can be confusing. Let me think: yes, ΔHf° for NH3(g) is approximately -46.1 kJ/mol. So for the reaction 2NH3(g), it would be 2*(-46.1) = -92.2 kJ. The reactants are N2 and H2, which are elements in their standard form, so their ΔHf° is zero. So ΔH° for the reaction is -92.2 kJ, which is -92,200 J because we need to work in J for entropy units.

Next, the entropy change ΔS°. The standard molar entropy values (S°) are usually given in J/(mol·K). I think S° for N2(g) is about 191.6 J/(mol·K), H2(g) is around 130.7 J/(mol·K), and NH3(g) is about 192.3 J/(mol·K). Let me double-check these numbers because getting them right is crucial. Wait, I might have mixed up some values. Let me think again: N2 is a diatomic gas, so S° is higher. I think for N2(g), it's 191.6 J/(mol·K), H2(g) is 130.7 J/(mol·K), and NH3(g) is 192.3 J/(mol·K). Is that right? I think so.

So calculating ΔS° for the reaction:

ΔS° = [2 * S°(NH3)] - [S°(N2) + 3 * S°(H2)]

Plugging in the numbers:

ΔS° = [2 * 192.3] - [191.6 + 3 * 130.7] 

Calculating each part:

2 * 192.3 = 384.6 J/(mol·K)

191.6 + 3*130.7 = 191.6 + 392.1 = 583.7 J/(mol·K)

So ΔS° = 384.6 - 583.7 = -199.1 J/(mol·K). Wait, that's a negative entropy change, which makes sense because we're forming two moles of a more ordered substance (NH3) from more disordered reactants (N2 and H2).

Now, the temperature is 500 K. So plugging into the Gibbs equation:

ΔG° = ΔH° - TΔS°

But wait, ΔH° is in kJ and ΔS° is in J, so I need to make sure the units match. Let me convert ΔH° to J: -92,200 J.

So,

ΔG° = (-92,200 J) - (500 K) * (-199.1 J/(mol·K))

Calculating the second term:

500 * (-199.1) = -99,550 J, but since it's minus that, it becomes +99,550 J.

So ΔG° = (-92,200) + 99,550 = 7,350 J/mol.

Wait, that's about 7.35 kJ/mol. But looking at the options, the units are in mol⁻¹, so 7.35 kJ/mol is 7,350 J/mol, which is 7.35 kJ·mol⁻¹, but the options are labeled as mol⁻¹ without specifying kJ or J. So 7.35 kJ·mol⁻¹ would be approximately 7.4, which is close to option D:7 mol⁻¹.

Wait, but wait, the standard Gibbs energy is usually given as ΔGf° for formation, which is per mole of NH3, but in this reaction, we're forming 2 moles. So I think I might have messed up the calculation. Wait, no, the reaction is 2NH3, so the ΔG° I calculated is for the reaction as written, meaning it's for 2 moles of NH3. But the options are per mole? Let me check again.

Wait, no, the options don't specify per mole of reaction, they're just mol⁻¹. So if the calculation gives 7.35 kJ for the entire reaction (which produces 2 moles), then per mole of NH3, it's 7.35 / 2 = 3.675 kJ/mol. But wait, that doesn't match any of the options. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the stoichiometry.

Wait, wait, no. Let me think again. The reaction is N2 + 3H2 → 2NH3. So the ΔG° I've calculated is for this entire reaction. If the options are for the reaction as written, then the answer would be about 7.35 kJ, which is close to option D:7 mol⁻¹. But wait, the options are in mol⁻¹, so perhaps they're per mole of reaction, not per mole of product. So the answer would be approximately 7, which is option D.

Wait, but wait, another thing: I might have messed up the sign. Let me check the calculation again.

ΔH° is -92,200 J.

TΔS° is 500 * (-199.1) = -99,550 J.

So ΔG° = (-92,200) - (-99,550) = (-92,200) + 99,550 = 7,350 J, which is 7.35 kJ. So positive 7.35 kJ for the reaction as written. Wait, but wait, that can't be right because the standard Gibbs energy at 298 K is more negative. Wait, but wait, at higher temperatures, the sign of ΔG can change if the reaction becomes more entropy-driven.

Wait, but let me think again: the standard Gibbs energy at 298 K for this reaction is known to be quite negative because ammonia formation is spontaneous under standard conditions. But at higher temperatures, the entropy term becomes more significant. So if ΔS is negative, as we found, then increasing temperature would make TΔS more negative, which would make ΔG less negative or even positive.

Wait, but in our calculation, ΔG° at 500 K is positive 7.35 kJ, which is about 7 kJ. So that would correspond to option D:7 mol⁻¹. But wait, that seems a bit off because I thought the standard Gibbs energy at 298 K is about -33 kJ for this reaction.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the values of ΔHf° and S°. Let me double-check those values.

Another approach: I remember that the standard Gibbs energy of formation for NH3 is about -16.6 kJ/mol at 298 K. So for 2 moles, that would be -33.2 kJ. But at 500 K, the value would be higher (less negative) because the entropy term becomes less negative. Wait, no, because as temperature increases, the TΔS term becomes more significant. Since ΔS is negative, TΔS becomes more negative as T increases, which makes ΔG = ΔH - TΔS less negative or even positive.

Wait, maybe I should use the van 't Hoff equation or the Gibbs equation with the standard values. Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate ΔG° at 500 K using the standard ΔH and ΔS at 298 K.

Let me recheck the values:

ΔH° (reaction) = 2*(-46.1) = -92.2 kJ.

ΔS° (reaction) = [2*(192.3)] - [191.6 + 3*(130.7)] = 384.6 - [191.6 + 392.1] = 384.6 - 583.7 = -199.1 J/K.

So TΔS = 500 K * (-199.1 J/K) = -99,550 J = -99.55 kJ.

So ΔG° = ΔH° - TΔS = (-92.2) - (-99.55) = (-92.2) + 99.55 = 7.35 kJ. So the reaction Gibbs energy at 500 K is +7.35 kJ, which is about +7.4 kJ for the reaction as written (producing 2 moles of NH3). Thus, per mole of reaction, it's +7.4 kJ, which would correspond to option D:7 mol⁻¹.

But wait, I think I might have confused the reaction's stoichiometry. The question asks for the standard reaction Gibbs energy, which is for the reaction as written. So the answer is +7.4 kJ, which is approximately 7 kJ, so option D.

But I'm a bit confused because I thought at higher temperatures, the reaction becomes less spontaneous, which aligns with the positive ΔG here. At 298 K, ΔG is negative, but at 500 K, it's positive, meaning the reaction is non-spontaneous under standard conditions at 500 K.

So the correct answer should be D:7 mol⁻¹.

The standard reaction Gibbs energy (ΔG°) is calculated using the equation:

\[
\Delta G^\circ = \Delta H^\circ - T\Delta S^\circ
\]

For the reaction \( \mathrm{N}_2(\mathrm{g}) + 3 \mathrm{H}_2(\mathrm{g}) \rightarrow 2 \mathrm{NH}_3(\mathrm{g}) \), the standard enthalpy change (\(\Delta H^\circ\)) is determined from the standard enthalpies of formation (\(\Delta H_f^\circ\)):

\[
\Delta H^\circ = 2 \cdot \Delta H_f^\circ(\mathrm{NH}_3) - \left[ \Delta H_f^\circ(\mathrm{N}_2) + 3 \cdot \Delta H_f^\circ(\mathrm{H}_2) \right]
\]

Given \(\Delta H_f^\circ(\mathrm{NH}_3) = -46.1 \, \mathrm{kJ/mol}\), and \(\Delta H_f^\circ(\mathrm{N}_2) = \Delta H_f^\circ(\mathrm{H}_2) = 0\), we find:

\[
\Delta H^\circ = 2 \cdot (-46.1) = -92.2 \, \mathrm{kJ}
\]

Next, the standard entropy change (\(\Delta S^\circ\)) is calculated using the standard molar entropies (\(S^\circ\)):

\[
\Delta S^\circ = 2 \cdot S^\circ(\mathrm{NH}_3) - \left[ S^\circ(\mathrm{N}_2) + 3 \cdot S^\circ(\mathrm{H}_2) \right]
\]

Using \(S^\circ(\mathrm{N}_2) = 191.6 \, \mathrm{J/(mol \cdot K)}\), \(S^\circ(\mathrm{H}_2) = 130.7 \, \mathrm{J/(mol \cdot K)}\), and \(S^\circ(\mathrm{NH}_3) = 192.3 \, \mathrm{J/(mol \cdot K)}\), we compute:

\[
\Delta S^\circ = 2 \cdot 192.3 - (191.6 + 3 \cdot 130.7) = 384.6 - 583.7 = -199.1 \, \mathrm{J/(mol \cdot K)}
\]

At \(T = 500 \, \mathrm{K}\), the term \(T\Delta S^\circ\) is:

\[
T\Delta S^\circ = 500 \cdot (-199.1) = -99,550 \, \mathrm{J}
\]

Converting \(\Delta H^\circ\) to joules:

\[
\Delta H^\circ = -92,200 \, \mathrm{J}
\]

Substituting into the Gibbs equation:

\[
\Delta G^\circ = \Delta H^\circ - T\Delta S^\circ = -92,200 - (-99,550) = -92,200 + 99,550 = 7,350 \, \mathrm{J}
\]

Converting to kilojoules:

\[
\Delta G^\circ = 7.35 \, \mathrm{kJ}
\]

This corresponds to approximately \(7 \, \mathrm{mol}^{-1}\), matching option D. The positive value indicates that the reaction is non-spontaneous under standard conditions at 500 K.
