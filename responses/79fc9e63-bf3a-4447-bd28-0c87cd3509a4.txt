Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about personnel selection methods and their predictive validity in industry. I'm a bit new to this topic, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is asking which of the options has the highest predictive validity. Predictive validity refers to how well a selection method can predict future job performance. So, I need to recall which methods are known for being good predictors.

Let's look at the options:

A: Projective technique – I remember these are methods like the Rorschach inkblot test. They're used to assess personality but are often criticized for low reliability and validity, especially in selection contexts.

B: Skills test – These test specific skills relevant to the job. They should have high predictive validity because they directly measure job-related abilities.

C: Reference check – This involves verifying past job performance and behaviors. While useful, it's more about confirming what's already happened rather than predicting future performance, though it can indicate consistency.

D: Job sample test – This is where candidates perform actual job tasks. I think these have very high predictive validity because they simulate real job duties, making them strong indicators of future performance.

E: Objective personality inventory – These are standardized tests, like the Myers-Briggs. Their validity can vary, but they're generally considered less predictive than skills or job samples because personality alone doesn't fully predict job success.

F: Self-assessment survey – These ask candidates to evaluate their own skills and traits. They might be useful but are subject to bias and may not have high predictive power.

G: Group interview – This assesses how well candidates interact in groups. It's useful for teamwork but might not predict individual performance as accurately as other methods.

H: Biographical inventory – This looks at past experiences and achievements. It can provide some insight but may not be as strong as other methods in predicting future behavior.

I: Interview by the personnel manager – Interviews can be subjective and vary widely in quality. While they can provide useful information, their predictive validity isn't as high as more objective methods.

So, putting this together, job sample tests (D) and skills tests (B) are strong contenders. Skills tests directly measure ability, which is crucial, but job sample tests actually involve performing tasks similar to the job, which should be even more predictive. Projective techniques and interviews are less reliable. Therefore, I think D is the best answer.

The correct answer is D: A job sample test, as it directly simulates job tasks and has high predictive validity.

Answer: D
