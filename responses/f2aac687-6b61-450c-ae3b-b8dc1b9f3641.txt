Hmm, okay, I need to figure out what the power dissipation in an ideal inductor is. Let me think about what I know about inductors and power dissipation.

So, an inductor is a component in electrical circuits that opposes changes in current. It does this by inducing an electromotive force (EMF) when the current through it changes. Now, power dissipation refers to the energy lost as heat in a component. I remember that in resistors, power is dissipated because of the resistance, and the formula is P = I²R.

But wait, in an ideal inductor, there's no resistance. Oh right, the term "ideal" implies that we're considering an inductor with zero resistance. So, if there's no resistance, then the power dissipated should be... zero? Because power in resistors comes from the resistance causing voltage drops and current flowing through it. Without resistance, there's no power loss.

Let me think about the formulas. The instantaneous power in an inductor is given by P = V × I, where V is the voltage across it and I is the current. The voltage across an inductor is V = L × (dI/dt), where L is inductance and dI/dt is the rate of change of current. So, substituting, P = L × (dI/dt) × I.

But wait, that's the instantaneous power. However, in an ideal inductor, since there's no resistance, the current can change instantaneously, but the power at any instant depends on the current and its rate of change. However, when considering average power over a complete cycle in an AC circuit, the average power dissipated would be zero because the power varies and the positive and negative halves cancel out. But wait, is that the case?

Wait, no. Wait, in DC circuits, if the current is steady, then dI/dt is zero, so the instantaneous power is zero. So, for a DC current, ideal inductor doesn't dissipate any power, which makes sense because it's just storing energy in the magnetic field.

In AC circuits, the power in an inductor is also zero on average because the current and voltage are 90 degrees out of phase. The power is maximum when the current is zero and zero when the current is maximum, so the average power is zero.

So, putting it all together, the power dissipation in an ideal inductor is zero because there's no resistance, and the average power over time is zero. Therefore, the correct answer should be H: Zero.

The power dissipation in an ideal inductor is zero because an ideal inductor has no resistance, and thus no energy is lost as heat. 

Answer: H
