Okay, so I have this biology question here, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me read it again carefully.

The question is asking which of the listed animals would maintain a constant body temperature despite changes in the environmental temperature. The options given are frog, robin, fish, dog, or lizard. The choices are from A to J, each pairing different animals.

Hmm, I remember that animals are often classified as either warm-blooded (endothermic) or cold-blooded (ectothermic). Warm-blooded animals can maintain a constant internal body temperature, regardless of the surrounding environment. Cold-blooded animals, on the other hand, rely on external sources to regulate their body temperature.

Let me list out each animal and determine whether they are endothermic or ectothermic.

- Robin: Birds are generally warm-blooded. Robins would definitely maintain a constant body temperature.
- Dog: Mammals are also warm-blooded. Dogs maintain a constant internal temperature.
- Fish: Fish are cold-blooded. Their body temperature typically matches the surrounding water, so they don't maintain a constant internal temperature.
- Frog: Frogs are cold-blooded as well. They rely on their environment to regulate their body temperature.
- Lizard: Lizards are reptiles, which are cold-blooded. They don't maintain a constant body temperature.

Wait, but I might be mixing up some details. Let me double-check. I think all birds and mammals are endothermic, which means they can maintain a constant body temperature. Fish, amphibians, and reptiles are ectothermic, so their body temperature changes with the environment.

So the question is which of the listed animals maintain a constant body temperature. From the list, robin and dog are warm-blooded. The other options (frog, fish, lizard) are cold-blooded.

Looking at the options provided:

Option A: dog, robin, fish → Fish is cold-blooded, so this is incorrect.
Option B: robin, dog → Both are warm-blooded, correct.
Option C: lizard, frog → Both cold-blooded, incorrect.
Option D: fish, robin → Fish is cold, robin is warm. Only robin is correct.
Option E: fish, frog → Both cold, incorrect.
Option F: fish, dog, lizard → Fish and lizard are cold, dog is warm. Partially correct but includes incorrect ones.
Option G: frog, lizard → Both cold, incorrect.
Option H: dog, lizard → Dog is warm, lizard is cold. Partially correct.
Option I: dog, fish → Dog is warm, fish is cold. Partially correct.
Option J: robin, lizard → Robin is warm, lizard is cold. Partially correct.

The correct answer should include only warm-blooded animals. So the only option where both are warm is B: robin and dog.

I think that's the right choice because both birds and mammals (like dogs) are endothermic, while the others are ectothermic. So the answer should be B.

The correct answer is B: robin and dog. Both are warm-blooded animals, meaning they can maintain a constant body temperature regardless of environmental changes. 

Answer: B
