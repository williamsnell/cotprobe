Okay, so I've got this question about the balance of payments deficit, and I need to figure out what it means. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that the balance of payments is a record of all the economic transactions between a country and the rest of the world over a specific period, usually a quarter or a year. It's divided into two main parts: the current account and the capital account, but sometimes people talk about it more generally.

A balance of payments deficit means that the country is spending more than it's earning from international transactions. So, it's like when you spend more money than you bring in. In more concrete terms, the country is importing more goods and services than it's exporting. So, the value of imports exceeds the value of exports.

Looking at the options, let me go through each one. Option A says the country has taken in more money than it sent abroad. That sounds like a surplus, not a deficit. Because if you take in more, you're earning more than spending. So A is probably wrong.

Option B: decreased its national income. Hmm, not sure. A deficit might affect the economy, but I don't think it directly means the national income has decreased. It could be a factor, but I'm not certain. Maybe I'll come back to this.

Option C: reduced its national debt. Wait, a deficit in the balance of payments might lead to borrowing, which could increase national debt, not reduce it. So C is likely incorrect.

Option D: exported and imported goods at an equal rate. That would be a balance, not a deficit. So D is wrong.

Option E: lowered its official reserve position. Official reserves are the foreign currency, gold, and other assets held by the central bank. If a country is running a deficit, it might deplete its reserves to cover the difference. So E could be correct, but I'm not sure if that's the primary meaning of a deficit.

Option F: increased its national income. Again, not directly related. National income is more about production and earnings within the country. A deficit might relate to trade, not income levels. So F is probably not the answer.

Option G: increased its official reserve position. This seems opposite of E. If a country is importing more, it might need to sell reserves to pay for it, so G is likely wrong.

Option H: exported more than imported. That would be a surplus, not a deficit. So H is the opposite of what we're looking for.

Option I: imported more than exported. Yes, this makes sense. If a country imports more, it's bringing in more goods than it's selling, leading to a deficit in the balance of payments. So I is a strong candidate.

Option J: increased its national debt. As I thought earlier, a deficit might require the country to borrow more, increasing national debt. So J could be correct, but I need to see what the question is asking exactly.

The question is asking what a balance of payments deficit means. The primary definition is that the country is importing more than it's exporting. So the immediate answer is I. However, looking at the options, some might have secondary effects. Like, if a country is importing more, it might have to use its reserves (E) or borrow (J). But the direct meaning is about the flow of goods and services, not the financial consequences.

So, the correct answer should be I: imported more than it has exported.

The balance of payments deficit occurs when a country imports more goods and services than it exports, leading to a net outflow of money. This directly corresponds to option I.

Answer: I
