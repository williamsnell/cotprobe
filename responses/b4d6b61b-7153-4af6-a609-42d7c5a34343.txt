Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about calculating the Gibbs free energy change (ΔG) for a process involving water. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

The process is H₂O in solution at 25°C converting to pure H₂O at the same temperature. The solution is NaCl with a concentration 'm' and an osmotic pressure of 2.0 atm at 25°C. I need to find ΔG₂₉₈, the free energy change at 298 K.

Hmm, I remember that osmotic pressure (π) is related to the concentration of a solution. Osmotic pressure is given by π = iCRT, where i is the van't Hoff factor, C is the concentration, R is the gas constant, and T is the temperature in Kelvin.

Wait, the solution is NaCl. So NaCl dissociates into Na+ and Cl- ions, right? That means for each unit of NaCl, we get two ions. So the van't Hoff factor (i) would be 2.

But in this problem, they've given the osmotic pressure already as 2.0 atm. Do I even need to calculate it from concentration, or can I use it directly for finding ΔG?

Oh right, the formula for Gibbs free energy change for osmosis is ΔG = -πV, where V is the volume. Wait, no, more accurately, the formula is ΔG = -πV, but I think I need to be careful with units here.

Wait, let me think again. The Gibbs free energy change for the process is given by ΔG = -πV, where V is the volume of solution. Or wait, maybe it's per mole of solute or something else. No, I think the formula is ΔG equals negative osmotic pressure multiplied by the volume of the solution, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, I've heard that ΔG is calculated using the equation ΔG = nRT ln Q, but in this case, perhaps it's better to use the osmotic pressure relation.

Wait, another approach: in osmotic processes, the Gibbs free energy change can be calculated using the equation ΔG = -πV, where V is the volume in liters, and π is in atm. But wait, I think I'm mixing some terms here.

Wait, perhaps more accurately, the formula is ΔG = -π * V * 1L, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to recall. Oh, right! The formula for Gibbs free energy change when dealing with osmotic pressure is ΔG = -πV, where V is the volume in liters. So if the osmotic pressure is 2.0 atm, then we just multiply that by the volume, but wait, the problem states that the solution is NaCl with concentration m, but maybe the volume isn't given. Wait, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, wait, the problem says the solution is NaCl with a certain concentration m and osmotic pressure π. But I think the key here is that the process is H₂O in solution going to pure water. So this is a spontaneous process, but the osmotic pressure is the pressure that stops the flow, so the system is at equilibrium when the chemical potentials are equal.

Wait, but I'm trying to find ΔG for the process. Let me think. The process given is H₂O(solution) → H₂O(pure). So the Gibbs free energy change for this process would be negative because the system tends to move from higher to lower chemical potential, but perhaps that's only under certain conditions.

Wait, another formula I remember is that ΔG = nRT ln Q, but for a solution, maybe it's better to think in terms of osmotic pressure. Alternatively, the Gibbs free energy change can be calculated using ΔG = VΔP, but I'm not sure about the sign.

Wait, let me get back. The formula I'm pretty sure about is that the osmotic pressure π is equal to Δπ, which is the difference in pressure due to the concentration gradient. And the Gibbs free energy change can be found by considering the work done against this pressure.

Wait, I think the correct formula is ΔG = -πV, where V is the volume of the solution. But in this problem, I might not have the volume given. Hmm, but wait, maybe the volume is 1 liter because the options are in cc-atm, which would be cm³·atm, and 1 liter is 1000 cc. So if the volume is 1 liter, then V is 1000 cm³.

Wait, let's think again. The formula for Gibbs free energy change when considering osmotic pressure is ΔG = -πV. So if the osmotic pressure π is 2.0 atm and the volume V is, say, 1 liter (1000 cm³), then ΔG would be -2.0 atm * 1000 cm³ = -2000 cm³·atm. But wait, the options don't have a negative value; they're all positive. So maybe I'm missing a negative sign, but the problem might be considering the magnitude, or perhaps I should take the absolute value.

Wait, but the process is water moving from solution to pure, which is a spontaneous process when the solution is more concentrated. So the free energy change should be negative, but the options are all positive. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is ΔG = πV, but that would give a positive value. But I'm a bit confused.

Wait, another approach: the Gibbs free energy change for the process can be calculated as ΔG = nRT ln (Q), but in this case, perhaps it's better to use the relation between osmotic pressure and Gibbs free energy.

Wait, the formula I recall is ΔG = -πV, where V is the volume in liters. So if the osmotic pressure is 2 atm and the volume is, say, 1 liter, then ΔG = -2 atm * 1 L. But 1 L is 1000 cm³, so that's -2000 cm³·atm. But the options don't have that. Wait, perhaps the volume is different. Or maybe I'm getting the formula wrong.

Wait, perhaps the formula is ΔG = πV, taking the absolute value. But let's think about the units. The options are in cc-atm, so 1 cc is 1 cm³, which is 0.001 liters. So if the formula is ΔG = π * V (in cm³), then for V = 1000 cm³ (1 L), it's 2 atm * 1000 cm³ = 2000 cc-atm. But that's not an option either.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a factor. Oh wait! Because osmotic pressure is given by π = iCRT, and maybe I need to relate it to the number of moles. Wait, but the problem gives the osmotic pressure directly, so perhaps I don't need to calculate it from molarity.

Wait, but the process is H₂O in solution going to pure H₂O. So the Gibbs free energy change ΔG would be zero at equilibrium when the chemical potentials are equal. But in this case, the solution has an osmotic pressure of 2 atm, which indicates that pure water would flow into the solution to reduce the concentration until the osmotic pressure is balanced.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to approach it methodically.

The formula for Gibbs free energy change in terms of osmotic pressure is ΔG = -πV, where V is the volume of the solution. So if the osmotic pressure is 2 atm and the volume is, say, 1 liter (1000 cm³), then ΔG = -2 atm * 1000 cm³ = -2000 cm³·atm. But the options don't have -2000. The closest is option C:90, which is way off. Hmm, maybe I'm using the wrong formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula is ΔG = nRT ln (γ2/γ1), but for pure substances, maybe it's better to think in terms of chemical potential. Alternatively, since the process is H₂O going from solution to pure, perhaps the chemical potential is higher in the solution, so the process would be spontaneous, leading to a negative ΔG.

Wait, but I think I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to think again. The formula I remember is ΔG = -πV, where V is the volume. So if the osmotic pressure is 2 atm and the volume is, say, 1 liter (1000 cm³), then ΔG is -2 * 1000 = -2000 cc-atm. But none of the options match that. Wait, maybe the volume is in a different unit, like 1 cm³, which would give -2 cc-atm. But that's not an option either. Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses V in liters, so 2 atm * 1 L = 2 L·atm, but 1 L·atm is approximately 101.325 J, but the units here are cc-atm, so 1 L·atm is 1000 cc·atm.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the formula. Another approach: The Gibbs free energy change for a process is given by ΔG = VΔP, where ΔP is the osmotic pressure. But wait, in this case, the process is the transfer of water from solution to pure, so perhaps the pressure difference is the osmotic pressure. So, ΔG = Vπ. But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the correct formula is ΔG = RT ln Q, where Q is the reaction quotient. For osmosis, Q would be the concentration ratio. But since pure water has an activity of 1, and the solution has an activity less than 1, ln Q would be negative, making ΔG negative. But I'm not sure exactly how to apply this here.

Wait, let's think about it in terms of the equation for osmotic pressure. The osmotic pressure π is equal to the Gibbs free energy change per mole divided by the volume. So π = ΔG/(nV), where n is the number of moles. Wait, no, perhaps it's π = (ΔG)/(nV), but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, another formula I came across is ΔG = -nRT ln (C2/C1), where C is the concentration. But in this case, the process is going from solution (C) to pure water (C=0?), which would make ln (0/C) approach negative infinity, but that doesn't fit the problem.

Wait, perhaps I should use the relation ΔG = -πV, but I'm not sure about the volume. Wait, in the problem statement, the solution is NaCl of concentration m. But the osmotic pressure is given, so maybe the volume isn't needed because the formula can be expressed in terms of osmotic pressure directly.

Wait, another thought: The formula for Gibbs free energy change when the system is at equilibrium due to osmotic pressure is ΔG = 0. But when pure water is placed in a solution, the water will move until the chemical potentials are equal, which is when the osmotic pressure is balanced. So the ΔG for the spontaneous process would be negative, but the question is asking for the free energy change for the process H₂O(solution) → H₂O(pure).

Wait, maybe the correct approach is to consider that the osmotic pressure π is the pressure that must be applied to stop the flow. The Gibbs free energy change for the process would be ΔG = -πV, where V is the volume of the solution. But in this problem, the volume isn't given. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the process is considered per mole of water. So maybe I need to express the Gibbs free energy change per mole. But without knowing the number of moles, that might not be possible.

Wait, another angle: The Gibbs free energy change can also be calculated using the formula ΔG = nRT ln (P2/P1), where P is the partial pressure of water vapor, but that might not apply here because we're dealing with osmotic pressure, not vapor pressure.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to find the formula again. I think the correct formula is ΔG = -πV, where V is the volume in liters. So if the osmotic pressure is 2 atm and the volume is 1 liter, then ΔG is -2000 cc-atm (since 1 L = 1000 cc). But the options don't have that. The options are A:36, B:72, etc. So perhaps the volume is different.

Wait, but the problem states that the solution has an osmotic pressure of 2.0 atm. So maybe the volume is 1 liter, and the ΔG is -2000 cc-atm. But that's not an option. Alternatively, perhaps the volume is 1 cm³, making ΔG = -2 cc-atm, but that's also not an option.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a factor because of the van't Hoff factor. Since it's NaCl, which dissociates into two ions, the osmotic pressure is 2.0 atm. So the molarity would be π/(iRT), but maybe that's not needed here since π is already given.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is ΔG = -mRT, where m is the molality, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the formula is ΔG = RT ln (γ2/γ1), but without knowing the activities, that's tricky.

Wait, another approach: The formula for Gibbs free energy change is ΔG = VΔπ, where Δπ is the osmotic pressure difference. If the process is water moving from pure to solution, then the osmotic pressure difference is +2 atm, so ΔG would be positive. But if it's moving from solution to pure, then the pressure difference would be negative, making ΔG negative. But again, without knowing the volume, I can't compute it.

Wait, perhaps the problem assumes that the volume is 1 cm³. Let's test that. If V=1 cm³ (which is 0.001 liters), then ΔG = -πV = -2 atm * 1 cm³ = -2 cc-atm. But that's not an option. Alternatively, maybe the formula is ΔG = πV, giving +2 cc-atm, but that's also not an option.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a scaling factor. Let me think about units. The osmotic pressure π is in atm, and the volume is in cm³. So 1 atm * 1 cm³ = 1 cc·atm. So if the osmotic pressure is 2 atm and the volume is, say, 1 liter (1000 cm³), then ΔG would be -2 * 1000 = -2000 cc·atm. But that's not an option.

Wait, maybe the volume isn't 1 liter. Perhaps the problem is considering 1 mole of solution or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is different.

Wait, another thought: The formula for Gibbs free energy change is also given by ΔG = nRT ln (Q), where Q is the reaction quotient. For pure water, the activity is 1, and in solution, it's lower. So maybe Q is less than 1, making ln Q negative, so ΔG would be negative. But without knowing n or Q, I can't compute the exact value.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to use the osmotic pressure formula π = iCRT and then relate it to ΔG. So, π = iCRT → C = π/(iRT). But then, how does that relate to ΔG?

Wait, another formula I found is that the Gibbs free energy change can be calculated as ΔG = -nFΔE, where ΔE is the cell potential, but that's for electrochemical cells, not osmotic pressure.

Wait, maybe I'm approaching this the wrong way. Let me think about the process. The process is water moving from a solution (NaCl) to pure water. The osmotic pressure is the pressure that needs to be applied to stop this movement. So, if the system is allowed to proceed without any pressure, the process would be spontaneous, and ΔG would be negative.

But the problem gives the osmotic pressure as 2 atm, which is the pressure that must be applied to stop the flow. So the Gibbs free energy change for the process (without any pressure) would be the maximum non-expansion work, which is related to the osmotic pressure.

Wait, perhaps the formula is ΔG = πV, where V is the volume. So using π =2 atm, and assuming V is 1000 cm³ (1 liter), ΔG would be 2 atm * 1000 cm³ = 2000 cc·atm. But the options don't have that. Wait, the options are A:36, B:72, etc. So perhaps the volume is different. Alternatively, maybe the formula is ΔG = πV/2 because of the two ions from NaCl.

Wait, but I think I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to think of the options. The options are all positive, so perhaps the answer is positive. The closest I can think is that if V is 1 cm³, then ΔG = 2 cc-atm, but that's not an option. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is ΔG = π * V * (number of ions), but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to look for the formula again. The correct formula for Gibbs free energy change in terms of osmotic pressure is ΔG = -πV, where V is the volume of the solution. So if the osmotic pressure is 2 atm and the volume is, say, 1 liter (1000 cm³), then ΔG = -2 * 1000 = -2000 cc-atm.

But the options don't have that. The closest option is F:54, which is way off. Hmm, maybe I'm using the wrong formula. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is ΔG = π * V, which would give +2000, but again, not an option.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering only the molarity and not the volume. Let me think: If the osmotic pressure is 2 atm, and using π = iCRT, then C = π/(iRT). But I'm not sure how that connects to ΔG.

Wait, maybe the Gibbs free energy change can be found using ΔG = nRT ln (C2/C1), but in this case, C2 is pure water (activity 1), and C1 is the concentration in solution. So ΔG = nRT ln (1/C), which would be negative since C < 1.

But without knowing the number of moles or the concentration, I can't compute the exact value. Wait, but the problem gives the osmotic pressure, so maybe nRT can be expressed in terms of π.

Wait, since π = iCRT, then RT = π/(iC). Substituting into ΔG, we get ΔG = n * (π/(iC)) * ln (1/C). But without knowing n or C, I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps the problem is implying that the solution is 1 liter, so V=1L=1000 cm³, and the osmotic pressure is 2 atm. So ΔG = -πV = -2 atm * 1000 cm³ = -2000 cc-atm. But again, that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a factor because NaCl dissociates into two ions, so i=2, and that affects the calculation. But I'm not sure how. Alternatively, maybe the formula is ΔG = πV * i, which would be 2 * 2000 = 4000, but that's not an option either.

Wait, perhaps the problem is simpler than that. Maybe the formula is ΔG = π * V, and the volume is 1000 cm³, giving 2000 cc-atm, but since that's not an option, perhaps I'm using the wrong approach.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is ΔG = nRT ln (x2/x1), where x is the mole fraction. But without knowing the mole fractions, that's not helpful.

Wait, maybe I should look for the answer in the options and see which one makes sense. The options are A:36, B:72, etc. Wait, perhaps the volume is 36 cm³, so π=2 atm, V=36 cm³ → ΔG = -72 cc-atm. But that would be option B. Alternatively, I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the formula. Another approach: The Gibbs free energy change is given by ΔG = -RT ln Q, where Q is the reaction quotient. For osmotic pressure, Q is the concentration ratio.

Wait, but without knowing the concentrations, I'm stuck. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is ΔG = πV, and the volume is 36 cm³, making ΔG =2 *36=72 cc-atm, which would be option B.

Wait, but why would the volume be 36 cm³? The problem doesn't specify the volume. Hmm. Maybe I'm overcomplicating again.

Wait, perhaps the formula is ΔG = π * V, and the volume is 36 cm³. But without knowing V, I can't say. Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is option B:72 cc-atm, based on some calculation I'm missing.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing osmotic pressure with other concepts. Let me think again. The osmotic pressure is given, and I need to find ΔG. The formula is ΔG = -πV. If I assume that the volume is 36 cm³, then ΔG = -72 cc-atm, which would match option B. But why 36 cm³?

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the molarity and relates it to the Gibbs free energy. But I'm not making progress here.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the formula is ΔG = RT ln (P2/P1), but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is ΔG = -nFΔE, but that's for electrochemical cells.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think of the possible answers. The options are A:36, B:72, C:90, etc. I think the correct approach is to use ΔG = -πV, where V is in cm³. If the osmotic pressure is 2 atm, and the volume is 36 cm³, then ΔG = -72 cc-atm, which is option B. But why would the volume be 36 cm³? Maybe the solution is 36 cm³, but the problem doesn't specify. Alternatively, perhaps the volume is 72 cm³, giving ΔG = -144, which isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the molarity and the number of ions. Let me try that. If the osmotic pressure π = iCRT, then C = π/(iRT). R is 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K), T is 298 K, i=2 for NaCl.

So C = (2 atm) / (2 * 0.0821 * 298) ≈ 2 / (2*0.0821*298) ≈ 2/(48.0) ≈ 0.04167 mol/L. But how does that help with ΔG?

Wait, perhaps the Gibbs free energy change per mole is ΔG° = -RT ln Q. But I'm not sure how to apply that here.

Wait, perhaps I've made a mistake earlier. The correct formula for Gibbs free energy change when considering osmotic pressure is ΔG = -πV. So if the osmotic pressure is 2 atm and the volume is, say, 36 cm³, then ΔG = -72 cc-atm, which is option B. But the problem doesn't specify the volume, so I'm not sure how to proceed.

Wait, perhaps the problem assumes that the volume is 36 cm³. But that's a big assumption. Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is option B:72 cc-atm, because 2 atm times 36 cm³ equals 72. But without knowing the volume, I'm just guessing.

Wait, I'm really stuck here. Maybe I should look for another approach. The formula I'm certain about is ΔG = -πV. So if the osmotic pressure is 2 atm and the volume is 36 cm³, then ΔG = -72 cc-atm, which is option B. But I'm not sure why the volume would be 36 cm³.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using molarity in a different way. Let me think: The molarity m is given, but the osmotic pressure is 2 atm. Using π = iCRT, I can find C. But without knowing the volume, I can't find n or anything else.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to calculate using molarity and then find ΔG. But without more information, I can't do that.

Wait, maybe the problem is asking for the maximum work, which is the osmotic pressure multiplied by the volume. So if the volume is 36 cm³, then 2 atm * 36 cm³ = 72 cc-atm, which is option B. But I'm not sure why the volume would be 36 cm³.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B:72 cc-atm, but I'm not entirely confident. I think I've spent enough time thinking through this, and the most plausible answer based on the formula and assuming a certain volume is option B.
</think>

The problem involves calculating the Gibbs free energy change (ΔG) for the process where water transitions from a solution to pure water. The solution is NaCl with an osmotic pressure of 2.0 atm at 25°C. The formula for Gibbs free energy change in terms of osmotic pressure is ΔG = -πV, where π is the osmotic pressure and V is the volume of the solution in cm³. 

Given that π = 2.0 atm, the volume V is assumed to be 36 cm³ based on the options provided. Substituting these values into the formula gives:

ΔG = -(2.0 atm)(36 cm³) = -72 cm³·atm.

Since the options provided are positive, the magnitude of the free energy change is taken, resulting in 72 cm³·atm. This corresponds to option B.

Answer: B
