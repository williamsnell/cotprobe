Question:

A motorcycle collector and his friend had known each other for years. The collector sent a letter to the friend that said, "I am willing to sell you my oldest motorcycle for $4,000." The friend sent the collector an email saying, "I accept your offer." The collector owned three motorcycles: a 1985 model, a 1987 model, and a 1992 model. The friend did not know about the 1985 model, which was the one the collector intended to sell. The collector was unaware that the friend intended to buy the 1987 model. When the collector tendered the 1985 model, the friend refused to accept it. Is the friend likely to prevail in a breach of contract suit against the collector?

Options:

A: No, because it was the friend's responsibility to know the details about the collector's motorcycles before agreeing to purchase.
B: No, because by not inquiring further about the meaning of the phrase "oldest motorcycle," the friend assumed the risk of being mistaken.
C: No, the friend won't prevail as he misunderstood the term "oldest motorcycle".
D: Yes, so long as a reasonable person in the friend's position would have considered the letter as referring to the 1987 model.
E: No, because neither the friend nor the collector had reason to know of the other's interpretation of the words "oldest motorcycle."
F: Yes, the friend will prevail as the collector falsely advertised the motorcycle model.
G: No, because the friend should have asked for clarification about which model was being sold before agreeing to the purchase.
H: Yes, because the friend could have reasonably assumed that the "oldest motorcycle" referred to the 1987 model, given his knowledge.
I: Yes, because the friend had no reason to know of the collector's meaning and the collector could have avoided the confusion by more careful drafting.
J: Yes, because the collector should have clarified which model he was referring to in the letter.

Okay, so I have this contract law question here, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The scenario is about a motorcycle collector and his friend. The collector wrote a letter offering to sell his "oldest motorcycle" for $4,000. The friend responded by email saying he accepts the offer. Now, the collector owns three motorcycles: a 1985, 1987, and 1992 model. The friend didn't know about the 1985 model, which was the one the collector intended to sell. The collector, on the other hand, didn't know the friend wanted the 1987 model. When the collector tried to hand over the 1985 bike, the friend refused it. The question is whether the friend will prevail in a breach of contract suit against the collector.

Hmm, so the main issue here seems to be about contract terms and mutual understanding. It's a case of mutual mistake or unilateral mistake. Let me recall what I know about contract law regarding mutual and unilateral mistakes.

First, mutual mistake occurs when both parties are mistaken about a basic assumption of the contract. If both parties have the same understanding, even if it's wrong, then it's a mutual mistake. In such cases, the contract can be rescinded because it's based on a shared misunderstanding.

Unilateral mistake is when only one party is mistaken, and the other isn't. If the mistaken party knew or should have known that there was a risk of being wrong, then they might not be able to rescind the contract. There's also the concept of caveat emptor, which means "let the buyer beware." This principle says that the buyer is responsible for making sure they understand what they're buying.

In this case, the collector intended to sell the 1985 model, which is the oldest. The friend didn't know about the 1985 model and probably thought the oldest was the 1987 model. The collector didn't realize the friend thought that way.

So, the friend accepted the offer based on his own understanding of what "oldest" meant, which was the 1987 model. But the collector sent the 1985 model, which the friend didn't want.

I think this is a case of mutual mistake. Both parties had different understandings of what "oldest motorcycle" referred to. The collector thought it was the 1985, the friend thought it was 1987. But wait, does that count as a mutual mistake? Because both were mistaken about the same term but in different ways. Or maybe it's a unilateral mistake because only one party was mistaken about the identity of the motorcycle.

Wait, no. Mutual mistake requires both parties to be wrong about the same fact. Here, the collector and the friend were each mistaken about the same term "oldest motorcycle." The collector thought it was the 1985, the friend thought it was the 1987. So, they both had different understandings, but it's a mutual mistake because the term was ambiguous. So, the contract was based on a mutual misunderstanding.

In contract law, if there's a mutual mistake about a fundamental aspect of the contract, the contract can be set aside. So, if both parties were mistaken about what the "oldest motorcycle" was, then neither party knew they were contracting about the same thing. So, the friend intended to buy the 1987, but the collector intended to sell the 1985. Since both had different intentions, there's a mutual mistake.

But wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The collector wrote that he would sell his "oldest motorcycle." The friend didn't know the collector had a 1985 model, so he assumed the oldest was the 1987. The collector intended to sell the 1985. So, when the collector sent the 1985, the friend refused. So, the issue is whether the friend can claim breach because the collector didn't deliver what the friend thought he was buying.

But under contract law, if the mistake is mutual and fundamental, the contract is void. So, if both parties were mistaken about the subject matter, the contract is not enforceable. So, the friend could argue that there was a mutual mistake, and thus the contract is void, meaning he doesn't have to perform, and the collector can't enforce it either.

Alternatively, if it's a unilateral mistake, then the rule is different. If the collector misunderstood the friend's intention, but the friend didn't know the collector had a 1985 model, perhaps it's a unilateral mistake. But I think it's mutual because both had different understandings of the term "oldest."

But wait, another angle: the friend didn't know the collector had a 1985 model. So, when the collector said "oldest," the friend might have thought it was the 1987, which was the oldest he knew about. The collector didn't know the friend was thinking about the 1987. So, neither party knew the other's understanding. So, it's a mutual mistake.

In such cases, the contract is voidable by both parties. So, the friend can choose not to go through with the contract because there was a mutual mistake about the subject matter.

Looking at the options, let's see which ones align with this reasoning.

Option A: No, because it was the friend's responsibility to know the details. This is the caveat emptor principle. But in this case, the friend didn't know the collector had a 1985 model. So, the friend couldn't have known about the oldest model beyond what he was aware of. So, this option might not be correct.

Option B: No, because the friend didn't inquire. Again, similar to A, it's about the friend's responsibility to know. But if the collector didn't mention the 1985 model, how would the friend know? So, this might not be the right answer.

Option C: No, because the friend misunderstood "oldest." But the problem is that the collector also had a misunderstanding. So, it's mutual, not just the friend's mistake.

Option D: Yes, if a reasonable person would have thought the letter referred to the 1987 model. So, it's about whether the friend's interpretation was reasonable. If the friend thought "oldest" was 1987, maybe that's reasonable given he didn't know about 1985. So, if a reasonable person would have thought it referred to 1987, the friend might have a case. But I'm not sure if this is the correct approach.

Option E: No, neither party had reason to know the other's interpretation. So, if both parties had different understandings without any knowledge of each other's, then the contract is based on mutual mistake. So, E says neither had reason to know, so the friend won't prevail. But I thought mutual mistake would allow the friend to void the contract.

Option F: Yes, because the collector falsely advertised. Falsely advertising would be a misrepresentation, but in this case, the collector didn't广告, he just said "oldest." Since the collector's own oldest is 1985, he didn't misrepresent; he just had a different understanding.

Option G: No, because the friend should have asked for clarification. Again, similar to A and B, it's about the friend's duty to inquire. But if the collector didn't volunteer the information, maybe it's not the friend's fault.

Option H: Yes, because the friend could have assumed "oldest" meant 1987. So, if the friend's assumption was reasonable, then perhaps the collector is bound to deliver what the friend thought they were buying. But I'm not sure if that's the case. It might depend on whether the term was ambiguous and whether the friend's interpretation was reasonable.

Option I: Yes, because the friend had no reason to know and the collector could have been clearer. So, this suggests that the collector's wording was ambiguous, leading to the mistake. If the collector had more clearly stated which model, there wouldn't have been a problem. So, the collector bears some responsibility for the ambiguity.

Option J: Yes, because the collector should have clarified. Similar to I, it's about the collector's responsibility to make the terms clear.

So, putting it all together, the main issue is whether the contract is enforceable. If it's a mutual mistake, the contract is void. So, the friend can back out without breach. But if it's a unilateral mistake, then the friend might be bound because he should have known.

Wait, but the friend didn't know about the 1985 model. The collector didn't mention it, so the friend couldn't have known. So, the friend's mistake was innocent, not due to lack of inquiry. Therefore, it's a mutual mistake, and the contract is voidable.

So, looking at the options, which ones support that the friend can prevail.

Option I says yes because the friend had no reason to know and the collector could have avoided confusion by better drafting. That seems correct because the collector didn't specify which model, leading to mutual mistake.

Option H says yes if the friend's assumption was reasonable. So, if the friend thought "oldest" was 1987, which he knew the collector had, then that's a reasonable assumption.

But wait, the collector's oldest was 1985, which the friend didn't know. So, the friend's assumption was based on incomplete information. But in contract law, if both parties have a mutual mistake about the subject matter, the contract is voidable.

So, the friend can argue that there was a mutual mistake, so he doesn't have to perform. Therefore, the collector can't sue him for breach because the contract is voidable.

Looking at the options, E says neither had reason to know, so the friend won't prevail. But I think that's incorrect because mutual mistake allows the friend to void the contract.

Wait, no. If there's a mutual mistake, both parties can void the contract. So, the collector can't enforce it, but the friend also isn't bound. So, the friend wouldn't be in breach.

Wait, the question is whether the friend is likely to prevail in a breach of contract suit against the collector. So, if the collector sues the friend for breach, will the friend win?

If the contract is voidable due to mutual mistake, then the friend can defend against the breach claim by saying the contract was void from the start. So, the friend wouldn't be in breach because the contract wasn't enforceable.

But looking at the options, which ones suggest that the friend can prevail (i.e., the answer is yes, the friend can win).

Options D, H, I, J say yes. Let's see.

Option E says no, because neither had reason to know. So, E is suggesting that because both were mistaken, the friend can't prevail. But I think mutual mistake means the friend can void the contract, so the friend wouldn't be liable for breach.

Wait, but the options are about whether the friend will prevail in a breach suit. So, if the collector sues the friend, the friend can argue that there was no valid contract because of mutual mistake. So, the friend's defense would be that the contract was voidable, so he didn't breach it.

In that case, the friend would prevail because the collector can't enforce a contract that's based on mutual mistake.

So, looking at the options, which ones support that the friend can defend successfully.

Option I: Yes, because the friend had no reason to know and the collector could have avoided confusion by more careful drafting. So, this suggests that the collector's wording was ambiguous, leading to mutual mistake, so the friend isn't liable.

Option E: No, because neither had reason to know. But that would mean the contract stands, which I don't think is correct.

So, I think the correct answer is either I or D or H.

Option D says yes, so long as a reasonable person would have thought the letter referred to the 1987 model. So, if the friend's interpretation was reasonable, then perhaps the collector is bound to deliver that model.

But under mutual mistake, the contract is void, so the friend doesn't have to accept the 1985. But if the collector intended to sell the 1985, and the friend intended to buy the 1987, the contract is void because there was no meeting of the minds.

So, the friend can argue that there was no valid contract, so the collector can't sue for breach.

In that case, the friend would prevail, so the correct answer would be yes.

Looking at the options, I think the correct answer is E: No, because neither the friend nor the collector had reason to know of the other's interpretation. Wait, but that would mean the contract stands as is, which I don't think is correct.

Wait, no. If neither had reason to know, it's a mutual mistake, so the contract is voidable. So, the friend can choose not to perform, and the collector can't enforce it. Therefore, the friend wouldn't be in breach.

But the options are about whether the friend will prevail in a breach suit. So, if the collector sues, the friend can defend by saying the contract was voidable due to mutual mistake, so he didn't breach. So, the friend would prevail.

So, looking back at the options, which ones support that.

Option I: Yes, because the friend had no reason to know and the collector could have avoided confusion by more careful drafting. So, this supports that the friend didn't know and the collector's wording was unclear, leading to mutual mistake.

Option E: No, because neither had reason to know. But that would suggest the contract is valid, which I don't think is right.

Option H: Yes, if a reasonable person would have thought "oldest" referred to 1987.

So, perhaps the correct answer is I or H.

I think the better answer is I because it points out that the collector could have been more precise, leading to mutual mistake. Therefore, the friend can void the contract.

But wait, another approach: the issue might be whether the term "oldest" was ambiguous. If the collector owned three bikes, the oldest being 1985, but the friend didn't know about it, then when the collector said "oldest," the friend had a different understanding. So, the term was ambiguous, leading to mutual mistake.

In such cases, the contract is voidable. So, the friend can choose not to go through with it, so the collector can't sue for breach.

Therefore, the friend would prevail, so the correct answer is yes, which would be options I, H, D, J.

Looking at the options, option I seems to fit because it says neither party had reason to know, and the collector could have been clearer.

So, I think the answer is I.

The question revolves around a contract dispute between a motorcycle collector and his friend. The collector offered to sell his "oldest motorcycle" for $4,000, intending to sell the 1985 model, while the friend assumed the "oldest" referred to the 1987 model, as he was unaware of the 1985 model. The friend refused the 1985 model, leading to the question of whether the friend would prevail in a breach of contract suit.

Key considerations include mutual mistake, unilateral mistake, and the enforceability of the contract. Mutual mistake occurs when both parties are mistaken about a fundamental aspect of the contract, rendering it voidable. In this case, both parties had different understandings of "oldest motorcycle," leading to a mutual mistake. The collector intended to sell the 1985 model, while the friend believed it referred to the 1987 model. Neither party knew the other's interpretation, making the contract voidable.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option I** correctly identifies that the friend had no reason to know about the 1985 model, and the collector's wording was ambiguous, leading to mutual mistake. This supports the friend's position that the contract is voidable.
- Other options, such as **E**, suggest the contract stands despite mutual mistake, which is incorrect. The friend can defend against the breach claim by arguing the contract was voidable due to mutual misunderstanding.

Thus, the friend is likely to prevail as the contract is voidable due to mutual mistake, and the collector cannot enforce it.

**Answer: I**
