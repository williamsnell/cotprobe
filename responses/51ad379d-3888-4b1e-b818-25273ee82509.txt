Question:

In multiprogrammed systems it is advantageous if some programs such as editors and compilers can be shared by several users. Which of the following must be true of multiprogrammed systems in order that a single copy of a program can be shared by several users?

II. The program is recursive.
III. The program is reentrant.

Options:

A: I and III only
B: II and III are true but not necessary for sharing a program
C: None of the statements must be true
D: II and III only
E: I only
F: I, II, and III all must be true
G: I and II only
H: II only
I: The program is non-recursive and reentrant
J: III only

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about multiprogrammed systems, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me take it step by step. The question is about what must be true for a single copy of a program to be shared by several users in a multiprogrammed system.

The question lists three statements: I, II, and III. I need to determine which of these must be true.

Statement I: The program is a macro. Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on this. I know that macros are a way to define code in a concise manner, often used in programming languages like C or C++. But does being a macro help in sharing a program across multiple users in a multiprogrammed system? I'm not entirely sure. I think macros are more about code expansion and not directly related to sharing program copies. So maybe I is not a necessary condition.

Statement II: The program is recursive. Recursive programs call themselves repeatedly until a base case is met. But how does recursion relate to sharing a program? Well, recursion uses the call stack, and each user's execution would have their own stack. So a recursive program can be run concurrently by multiple users because each instance runs in its own stack frame. But wait, does the program need to be recursive for sharing? Or can it be non-recursive and still be shared? I'm leaning towards the idea that recursion isn't a necessary condition. The program can be shared whether it's recursive or not, as long as it's properly managed by the system.

Statement III: The program is reentrant. Oh right, reentrant programs are designed so that multiple users can call them simultaneously. They don't rely on global variables or static data that would conflict between users. So a reentrant program can be shared because each call doesn't interfere with others. This makes sense because if a program isn't reentrant, having multiple users could lead to race conditions or data corruption. So III definitely must be true.

Now, looking at the options: the question is asking which statements must be true. So I need to see which of I, II, III must hold.

From my reasoning:

- I (macro) doesn't seem necessary. So I can rule out any option that requires I to be true. So options A (I and III), E (I only), G (I and II) are out.

- II (recursive) isn't necessary. So options D (II and III), which requires II, is out. H (II only) is also out.

- III (reentrant) is necessary, so any option without III is out. So B, C, F, J are also probably out.

Looking at the options again:

Option J says only III. But wait, the question is which must be true. So J says only III is true. But looking at the answer options, let me check:

Wait, the options are:

A: I and III only

B: II and III are true but not necessary for sharing

C: None of the statements must be true

D: II and III only

E: I only

F: I, II, and III all must be true

G: I and II only

H: II only

I: The program is non-recursive and reentrant

J: III only

Wait, but in my analysis, only III is necessary. So the answer should be J: III only.

But wait, another thought: is a program being reentrant the same as being a macro or recursive? No, reentrant is a separate concept. So if the program is reentrant, that's sufficient regardless of whether it's a macro or recursive. So the only necessary condition is III.

Therefore, the correct answer must be J: III only.

The correct answer is J: III only. Only the third statement must be true for a program to be shared in a multiprogrammed system.

**Answer: J**
