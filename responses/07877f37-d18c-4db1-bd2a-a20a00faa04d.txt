Okay, so I'm trying to answer this question about cointegration. Hmm, I remember that cointegration is a statistical property of a collection of time series variables which indicates that a linear combination of them has a stable mean over time. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact details, so let me think through each statement.

The question lists four statements (i to iv) and I need to determine which are true when two variables x_t and y_t are cointegrated. The options are A to J, each combining different statements.

Starting with statement i: "x_t and y_t must both be stationary." Wait, I think that's not correct. I remember that cointegrated variables are non-stationary individually but are said to be cointegrated if a linear combination makes them stationary. So if both were stationary, they wouldn't need cointegration because their relationship would already be captured in a stationary context. So statement i is false.

Moving to statement ii: "Only one linear combination of x_t and y_t will be stationary." I'm trying to recall. Cointegration implies that there exists at least one linear combination that's stationary. But can there be more than one? I think in the Engle-Granger two-step method, you find a single cointegrating vector. But is it possible to have multiple? I think in general, the cointegrating space is of a certain dimension, maybe more than one if there are more variables. Wait, but the question is about two variables. For two variables, the maximum rank is one, so there's only one cointegrating vector. So statement ii is true.

Statement iii: "The cointegrating equation for x_t and y_t describes the short-run relationship between the two series." Hmm, no, I think the cointegrating equation actually describes the long-run relationship. The short-run dynamics are usually modeled using something like a vector error correction model (VECM), which incorporates the cointegrating equation as a long-term equilibrium. So statement iii is false.

Statement iv: "The residuals of a regression of y_t on x_t must be stationary." Wait, when you regress y on x and the residuals are stationary, that suggests that y and x are cointegrated. Because if the residuals (y_t - beta x_t) are stationary, then the combination is stationary. So statement iv is true.

Wait, but I thought statement i was false, so let me check. The variables don't have to be stationary individually, but their combination must be. So i is false. So statement iv is correct because the residuals being stationary is part of the cointegration condition.

So looking back: i is false, ii is true, iii is false, iv is true.

Wait, but earlier I thought statement iii was false because cointegration is about the long run. So the cointegrating equation captures the long-run equilibrium. So in the question, statement iii says it's the short-run, which is incorrect. So iii is false.

So the true statements are ii and iv. Now, looking at the options:

Option D is (ii) and (iv) only. So that's the correct choice.

The correct answer is D: (ii) and (iv) only.

Answer: D
