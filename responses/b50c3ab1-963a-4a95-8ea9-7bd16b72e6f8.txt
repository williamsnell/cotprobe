Okay, let's see. I have this problem about bakers making apple pies. They have 15 boxes of apples, each box has 18 apples. They use 7 apples per pie. I need to find out how many pies they can make in total.

Hmm, so first, I should figure out the total number of apples they have. Since there are 15 boxes and each has 18 apples, I can multiply 15 by 18 to get the total apples. Let me do that: 15 times 18. Hmm, 15 times 10 is 150, and 15 times 8 is 120. Adding those together, 150 + 120 equals 270. So, they have 270 apples in total.

Now, each pie requires 7 apples. To find out how many pies they can make, I should divide the total number of apples by the number of apples per pie. So, 270 divided by 7. Let me calculate that. 

7 goes into 27 three times (7*3=21), with a remainder of 6. Bring down the 0, making it 60. 7 goes into 60 eight times (7*8=56), remainder 4. Bring down the next 0, making it 40. 7 goes into 40 five times (7*5=35), remainder 5. So, the division would give me 38 with a remainder of 5. So, 38 pies can be made, and there are 5 apples left over.

Wait, but I should make sure I'm not making a mistake. Let me check the calculation again. 15 times 18 is indeed 270. Yes, because 10 boxes would be 180, and 5 boxes would be 90, so 180+90=270. Then 270 divided by 7: 7*38=266, because 7*30=210 and 7*8=56, 210+56=266. Then 270-266=4. Wait, earlier I thought the remainder was 5, but now I'm getting 4. Did I miscalculate earlier?

Wait, maybe I messed up the division steps. Let me try dividing 270 by 7 again step by step. 

7 into 27 is 3, 3*7=21, remainder 6. Bring down the 0: 60. 7 into 60 is 8, 8*7=56, remainder 4. Bring down the next 0, making it 40. 7 into 40 is 5, 5*7=35, remainder 5. Wait, now I'm getting remainder 5 again. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the second calculation.

Wait, no, perhaps I should approach it differently. 7*38=266, as I thought before. 270-266=4, so the remainder is 4, which would mean 38 pies with 4 apples left. But when I did the division step by step, I ended up with a remainder of 5. I'm confused now. Maybe I should use a calculator method.

Alternatively, I can think of 7 times 38. 7*30=210, 7*8=56, so 210+56=266. So 266 apples used for 38 pies. 270-266=4 apples left. So the correct number of pies is 38, with 4 apples remaining. So the answer should be 38 pies, which is option F.

Wait, but looking at the options, option E is 42, F is 38, and others. So the correct answer is F:38.

The bakers have 15 boxes with 18 apples each, totaling 270 apples. Dividing by 7 apples per pie gives 38 pies with 4 apples remaining. 

Answer: F
