Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the median of a set of data. The data given is: $79.88, $21.88, $29.88, $19.88, $17.88. The options are from A to J, each with a different value. I remember that the median is the middle number in a sorted list of numbers. So, the first thing I need to do is sort these numbers in order from smallest to largest.

Let me list them out again to make sure I have them all: 79.88, 21.88, 29.88, 19.88, 17.88. Hmm, that's five numbers. When I sort them, the order should be from the smallest to the largest. Let me see:

Looking at the numbers, 17.88 is the smallest, then 19.88, followed by 21.88, then 29.88, and the largest is 79.88. So when I arrange them, it should be: 17.88, 19.88, 21.88, 29.88, 79.88.

Wait, let me double-check that. 17.88 is indeed the smallest. Next is 19.88. Then comes 21.88, which is higher than 19.88 but lower than 29.88. Then 29.88, and finally 79.88. Yep, that seems correct.

Now, since there are five numbers, which is an odd count, the median will be the third number in this sorted list. Let me count: first is 17.88 (1), then 19.88 (2), then 21.88 (3). So the third number is 21.88.

Wait a second, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Sometimes I get confused with the positions. For an odd number of observations, the median is at position (n+1)/2. Here, n is 5, so (5+1)/2 is 3. So the third number is the median. Yes, that's correct.

Looking back at the options, the options are:

A: $19.88 
B: $24.88
C: $30.88
D: $29.88 
E: $79.88
F: $22.88
G: $20.88
H: $21.88 
I: $17.88 
J: $18.88

So the median is 21.88, which corresponds to option H. Let me just scan through the options again to confirm. Option H is indeed $21.88. That's the one.

I think I've got it right. The median is the middle value after sorting, which is 21.88 in this case.

The median is found by sorting the data and selecting the middle value. After sorting, the middle value is $21.88, which is option H.
