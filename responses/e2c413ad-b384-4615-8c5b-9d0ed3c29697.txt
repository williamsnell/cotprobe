Answer the following multiple choice question, selecting from the answer A through to J. After thinking, reply directly with your answer. 

The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

As a legislative aide to a U. S. Senator you are called upon to provide an analysis of the constitutionality of a bill pending congressional approval. The bill imposes a 15% tax upon the gross annual receipts from the sales of all birth control devices. The bill has the strong support of conservative and pro-life organizations. The stated purpose of the proposed measure is to raise revenue and spur population growth across the country. In your learned opinion, the proposed tax is probably

Options:

A: constitutional, because the fact that the tax applies to all sales of every type of birth control device invalidates any possible objection to the tax on the grounds that it violates the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
B: unconstitutional, because it infringes on the rights of businesses to operate freely in the market.
C: unconstitutional, because it unfairly targets a specific industry, which violates the principle of fair trade.
D: unconstitutional, because in inseverable aggregates, the domestic purchases and sales of birth control devices affect interstate and foreign commerce.
E: unconstitutional, because it may disproportionately affect lower-income individuals who rely on these devices for family planning.
F: constitutional, because the tax applies universally to all forms of birth control devices, and thus does not single out any particular group or entity for discrimination.
G: constitutional, because it is within the government's rights to levy taxes to generate revenue, regardless of the potential social implications.
H: unconstitutional, because the tax burdens the fundamental right to privacy of users of birth control devices without establishing a compelling national interest for doing so.
I: constitutional, because the government has the power to tax as a means of controlling population growth.
J: constitutional, because the fact that controversial policy motives may have induced the enactment of an otherwise reasonable measure calculated to raise revenue does not ipso facto invalidate the tax.

Alright, I'm trying to figure out whether this proposed 15% tax on birth control devices is constitutional. The question is from the perspective of a legislative aide, so I need to think about how a court would analyze this.

First, I remember that taxes are generally allowed under the Constitution, especially if they're uniform and not discriminatory. The government has broad taxing powers, so unless there's a specific constitutional violation, a tax is likely constitutional.

Looking at the options, let's go through them one by one.

Option A says it's constitutional because it applies to all types, so equal protection isn't violated. But wait, equal protection is more about treating people the same. If the tax is on birth control, which is a specific category, does that make it discriminatory? I'm not sure yet.

Option B claims it's unconstitutional because it infringes on business freedom. But I don't recall a specific right to operate freely in the market that would override a tax. Taxes can affect businesses, but that doesn't automatically make them unconstitutional unless they're discriminatory or infringe on a fundamental right.

Option C says it's unconstitutional because it targets a specific industry. That sounds like it could be a commerce clause issue. But the commerce clause more often deals with regulation, not taxation. Plus, the tax applies to all sales, so it's not clear if it's unfair targeting.

Option D says it's unconstitutional because it affects interstate commerce. The tax is on receipts from sales, so it's a state or federal tax. The commerce clause might come into play if the tax burdens interstate commerce, but I'm not sure if a tax on a specific product would do that. The Supreme Court has sometimes struck down taxes that unduly burden interstate commerce, but this might be a revenue measure, which is allowed.

Option E suggests it's unconstitutional because it affects lower-income individuals. That's more of an equal protection or due process issue. If the tax disproportionately affects a certain group, maybe there's a problem. But birth control is a legal product, and the tax is on sales, not on individuals. So unless it's a fundamental right, the tax might still hold.

Option F says it's constitutional because it's universal. That makes sense because uniformity is key in taxation. If the tax applies to all birth control devices, it doesn't single out a particular group, so equal protection isn't violated here.

Option G says it's constitutional because the government can tax for revenue. This seems straightforward. The government's power to tax is well-established, unless the tax is used for an unconstitutional purpose. But here, the purpose is revenue and population growth, which seems legitimate.

Option H claims it's unconstitutional because it burdens the right to privacy. The Supreme Court has recognized a right to privacy regarding birth control, but a tax doesn't necessarily infringe on that right. It's more about the government's interest in taxing, which is a strong power. Unless the tax is a guise to restrict access, which isn't clear here, this might not hold.

Option I says it's constitutional because the government can tax to control population. While the government does have some authority in public welfare, I'm not sure if population control is a direct justification for a tax. It might be more about revenue than policy.

Option J states it's constitutional because the motives don't invalidate the measure. This makes sense because even if the motives are controversial, as long as the tax itself is reasonable and not discriminatory, it should be okay. The fact that it's supported by conservative groups doesn't make it unconstitutional.

Putting it all together, the key issues are whether the tax is discriminatory or infringes on a fundamental right. The tax applies universally to all birth control devices, so it's not targeting a specific group. The purposes are revenue and population growth, which are legitimate. The Supreme Court has upheld taxes on specific products, like medical devices, as constitutional.

Looking back, the correct answer is likely J because the bill is a valid tax measure, and the underlying motives, even if controversial, don't make it unconstitutional. Alternatively, F could be correct if the focus is on equal protection. But I think J is stronger because it directly addresses the constitutional validity despite policy motives.

Wait, but G says it's constitutional because the government can tax for revenue regardless of social implications. That's a strong point too. The government's taxing power is broad, so unless there's a specific constitutional violation, the tax should be allowed. So G and J are both plausible.

But the question is about constitutionality, and the fact that it's a tax for revenue is a solid reason. So G could be the answer. Alternatively, J is about the motives not affecting the tax's validity.

Hmm, I'm a bit torn. Let me think again. The Supreme Court has generally upheld taxes that are not discriminatory. In this case, the tax is on a specific product, but it's not a regulation; it's a tax. So under the government's taxing power, it's constitutional unless it's a direct infringement on a fundamental right.

So, the correct answer is J because the motives don't make it unconstitutional, or G because the government's right to tax is broad. I think J is more precise because it's addressing the concern that the bill's motives are controversial, but the tax itself is constitutional.

The proposed tax on birth control devices is likely constitutional because the government has broad authority to levy taxes, especially when they are uniform and not discriminatory. The tax applies to all sales of birth control devices, ensuring equal treatment under the law. While the bill has controversial motives, such as promoting population growth, the Constitution does not invalidate a tax solely based on its policy goals. Therefore, the tax is constitutional because it is a reasonable revenue measure, regardless of the underlying intentions.
