Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a bag of candies being emptied onto a spring scale. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll do my best.

Alright, the setup: There's a spring scale that's initially reading zero. Then, candies are being poured onto it. Each candy weighs 1 ounce. They drop from a height of 4 feet and hit the scale at a rate of 6 per second. The question is asking what the scale reads after 10 seconds, assuming all collisions are perfectly inelastic.

Hmm, okay. So, first, I need to figure out how many candies hit the scale in 10 seconds. Since the rate is 6 per second, in 10 seconds, that should be 6 * 10 = 60 candies. Each is 1 oz, so 60 oz in total. Wait, but that's just the weight, right? So that would be 60 oz. But wait, the options are in pounds and ounces. Let me convert that: 16 oz make a pound, so 60 divided by 16 is 3.75 pounds, which is 3 pounds and 12 ounces. Hmm, but that's not one of the options. Wait, maybe I'm missing something about the dynamics here.

Wait a second, the candies are dropping from a height. So when they hit the scale, they're not just adding their weight statically; they're also possibly adding some impact force due to their velocity when they hit. Oh right, when something falls and then stops, it's not just the weight that contributes to the force; the impact can cause an increase in the reading due to the change in momentum over time (impulse).

So I think I need to calculate the force each candy exerts when it hits the scale and comes to rest. Since the collisions are perfectly inelastic, each candy sticks to the scale, so there's a change in velocity from whatever speed they hit at to zero.

Wait, but the problem says "perfectly inelastic" collisions, which means they stick together, so yes, maximum force. But how do I compute that?

First, I need to find the velocity of each candy just before impact. They drop from 4 feet. Let's compute that. Using the equation for free fall: v² = u² + 2gh, where u is initial velocity (0), g is acceleration due to gravity, and h is height.

Wait, gravity in feet per second squared. I think in imperial units, g is approximately 32 ft/s². So h is 4 ft. So v² = 0 + 2*32*4 = 256. So v = sqrt(256) = 16 ft/s. So each candy hits the scale at 16 ft/s.

Now, when a candy hits the scale, it comes to rest. So the change in momentum (impulse) is mass times change in velocity. But wait, mass in slugs, since we're using pounds and ounces. Because in the imperial system, pounds are a unit of force, so mass is in slugs.

Wait, each candy is 1 oz. So first, convert ounces to pounds: 1 oz = 1/16 lb. Then, to get mass, we use F=ma. So mass m = F/(g), so m = (1/16 lb) / (32 ft/s²). Wait, but F in pounds is equal to mass in slugs times acceleration in ft/s². So yeah, m = (1/16) / 32 = 1/(16*32) slugs. Let me compute that: 16*32 = 512, so m = 1/512 slugs per candy.

Hmm, but maybe there's a simpler way. The impulse is change in momentum, which is mass times change in velocity. So the impulse for one candy is mΔv. Since it goes from 16 ft/s downward to 0, Δv is 16 ft/s upwards (the direction matters, but since the scale is supporting it, the force would be upward, so positive).

So impulse J = m * Δv. But impulse is also equal to force multiplied by time, J = F * Δt. So F = J / Δt.

Wait, but we need to find the force each candy exerts on the scale when it hits. So for each candy, the force would depend on the time it takes to stop. That's the tricky part because the time isn't given. But maybe we can model it as the time over which the candy decelerates to zero velocity.

Alternatively, perhaps we can calculate the average force during the collision. Since the candy starts at 16 ft/s and stops, the change in velocity is 16 ft/s. The mass is 1/512 slugs. So the change in momentum is (1/512) * 16 = 16/512 = 1/32 slug·ft/s.

Now, assuming that the collision time is very short, but without knowing Δt, this might be tricky. Alternatively, perhaps we can model the force as the weight plus the impact force. Wait, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: The scale reading will be the sum of the static weight of all candies that have landed plus the dynamic force from the impact of the candies that are currently hitting the scale.

But wait, in 10 seconds, 60 candies have hit the scale. But each candy takes some time to stop. But since 6 per second, maybe each candy's impact is spread out over time, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the key is that each candy, upon impact, imparts a force equal to its weight plus an additional force due to the impact. Alternatively, perhaps the impact adds a certain amount to the scale's reading.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. When an object falls and hits a surface, the scale reading increases due to the object's weight and the impact. The impact force can be found using the principle of conservation of momentum, considering the time it takes to stop.

But without knowing the stopping time, maybe we can model it as the change in momentum over a very short time, leading to an instantaneous force. Alternatively, perhaps we can use the concept that the maximum force during impact is the weight multiplied by (1 + coefficient of restitution), but since it's perfectly inelastic, the coefficient is zero. Hmm, maybe that's not the right approach.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to calculate the total impulse over the 10 seconds and then find the average force.

Each candy has a momentum change of m*v. Since each candy is 1 oz, which is 1/16 lb. So mass m = (1/16 lb) / (32 ft/s²) = 1/(16*32) slugs = 1/512 slugs.

Velocity v = 16 ft/s. So Δp = m * Δv = (1/512) * 16 = 16/512 = 1/32 slug·ft/s per candy.

Total number of candies in 10 seconds: 60. So total Δp = 60 * (1/32) = 60/32 = 15/8 slug·ft/s.

Impulse is also force multiplied by time, so F_avg * 10s = 15/8. So F_avg = (15/8) / 10 = 15/(80) = 3/16 pounds.

Wait, that can't be right because 3/16 lb is 3 oz, but that seems too low. Plus, that's the average force, but the scale reading is the static weight plus the impact force.

Wait, perhaps I'm not approaching this correctly. Let me try another angle. The static weight is 60 oz, which is 3.75 lb. But the impact adds an additional force.

Each candy, upon impact, not only supports its own weight but also decelerates from 16 ft/s to 0. The force during impact can be calculated using F = m*a, where a is the deceleration.

But to find a, we can use v² = u² + 2a*s, where s is the stopping distance. But we don't know s. Alternatively, perhaps we can model the time it takes to stop, Δt, and then find a = Δv / Δt.

But without knowing Δt, perhaps we can model the impact as an instantaneous change, and the maximum force is based on the change in momentum.

Wait, let's think about the force on the scale. Each candy, when it lands, exerts a force equal to its weight plus the force from decelerating. So the total force would be F = m*(g + a), where a is the deceleration.

But without knowing a, perhaps we can find the average force over the impact time. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simplifying things by assuming that each candy adds an additional force equal to its weight, making the total force twice the weight, but that doesn't make sense because the candy is not accelerating at that point.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about it differently. When an object falls and hits a surface, the scale reading increases by the object's weight plus the impact force. But in reality, the impact force is related to the change in momentum.

So for each candy, the impulse is Δp = m*v, as calculated earlier. The time over which this impulse occurs is very short, but for the purpose of average force, we can say that the average force is Δp / Δt. But since Δt is very small, the force is large.

But perhaps the problem is assuming that each candy's impact adds an amount equal to its weight to the scale reading. Wait, but that would mean each candy adds 1 oz twice, which would make the total 120 oz, which is 7.5 lb. But that's not matching any of the options.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering that each candy, upon impact, adds its weight plus the force from its momentum change. So each candy's contribution is its weight plus (mass * velocity). But mass is 1/16 lb, velocity is 16 ft/s. So (1/16 lb) * (16 ft/s) = 1 lb·ft/s. Hmm, but that's a unit of momentum, not force. Force is in pounds, so perhaps I'm missing something here.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the total impulse over the 10 seconds and then find the average force.

Total number of candies: 60. Each has a momentum change of (1/16 lb) * 16 ft/s = 1 lb·ft/s.

So total impulse J = 60 * 1 = 60 lb·ft/s.

Impulse is F_avg * t, so F_avg = J / t = 60 / 10 = 6 lb.

Wait, that's 6 lb. So the scale reading would be 6 lb 0 oz, which is option C.

Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check if this makes sense.

Each candy imparts an impulse of 1 lb·s (since 1 lb·ft/s is equivalent to 1 lb·s when considering the change in momentum, because F=ma, and the time is in seconds). So 60 candies would give 60 lb·s of impulse over 10 seconds, so average force is 6 lb. So the scale would read 6 lb 0 oz, which is option C.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the scale's reading is the sum of the static weight and the dynamic force. But if each candy's impact contributes an average force of 1 lb, then over 10 seconds, the total would be 60 * 1 lb, but that doesn't align with the earlier calculation.

Wait, no, because the 60 lb·s over 10 s gives an average force of 6 lb. So that would be the correct approach.

So the answer should be C: 6 lb 0 oz.

To determine the scale reading after 10 seconds, we analyze the forces acting on the candies as they fall and hit the scale. Each candy weighs 1 oz. and falls from a height of 4 ft., reaching a velocity of 16 ft/s just before impact. The scale records the total force exerted by the candies during their collisions.

1. **Number of Candies**: At a rate of 6 per second, 60 candies hit the scale in 10 seconds.
2. **Impulse Calculation**: Each candy imparts a momentum change of \( \Delta p = m \cdot v \), where \( m = \frac{1}{16} \) lb (converted from 1 oz.) and \( v = 16 \) ft/s. Thus, \( \Delta p = \frac{1}{16} \cdot 16 = 1 \) lb·ft/s per candy.
3. **Total Impulse**: For 60 candies, the total impulse is \( 60 \cdot 1 = 60 \) lb·ft/s.
4. **Average Force**: The average force exerted on the scale is \( F_{\text{avg}} = \frac{\text{Total Impulse}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{60}{10} = 6 \) lb.

Thus, the scale reading at the end of 10 seconds is **6 lb. 0 oz.**, corresponding to option C.
