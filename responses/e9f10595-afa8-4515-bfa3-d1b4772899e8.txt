Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about activation energy and reaction rates. Hmm, I remember that the rate of a reaction increases with temperature, and the activation energy has something to do with that. The question is asking what activation energy a reaction should have so that raising the temperature by 10°C (from 0°C to 10°C) would triple the reaction rate. The options are A to J, and I need to pick the right one.

I think the Arrhenius equation is relevant here. The Arrhenius equation relates the rate constant k to the temperature T and the activation energy Ea. The equation is k = A * exp(-Ea/(R*T)), where A is the pre-exponential factor and R is the gas constant.

Wait, but when comparing two temperatures, we can use the two-point form of the Arrhenius equation. The formula is ln(k2/k1) = (Ea/R) * (1/T1 - 1/T2). Here, k2 is the rate constant at the higher temperature, and k1 at the lower. Since the rate triples, k2/k1 = 3.

The temperatures are 0°C and 10°C, but I need to convert them to Kelvin. Oh right, Kelvin is Celsius plus 273.15. So T1 is 273 K and T2 is 283 K.

Plugging into the equation: ln(3) = Ea/(R) * (1/273 - 1/283). Let me calculate the difference in the reciprocals. 1/273 is approximately 0.003663 and 1/283 is about 0.003533. Subtracting gives 0.00013.

So ln(3) is approximately 1.0986. So 1.0986 = Ea/(R) * 0.00013. R is the gas constant, which I think is 8.314 J/(mol·K). So R is 8.314.

Let me rearrange the equation to solve for Ea. Ea = (ln(3) * R) / (1/T1 - 1/T2) ) Wait, no, wait: the equation is Ea = (ln(k2/k1) * R) / (1/T1 - 1/T2). Wait, no: the equation is ln(k2/k1) = Ea/(R) * (1/T1 -1/T2). So Ea = ln(k2/k1) * R / (1/T1 -1/T2).

Wait, let me double-check that. Let me write it again. The equation is ln(k2/k1) = (Ea/R) (1/T1 - 1/T2). So Ea = ln(k2/k1) * R / (1/T1 - 1/T2). Wait, no, because 1/T1 -1/T2 is positive since T2 is higher than T1, so 1/T1 is bigger. So the denominator is positive. Let me compute that.

Wait, 1/273 ≈ 0.003663, 1/283≈0.003534. The difference is 0.003663 - 0.003534 = 0.000129, which is about 0.000129.

So Ea = ln(3) * R / (1/273 - 1/283) = (1.0986) * (8.314) / 0.000129.

Let me compute the numerator first: 1.0986 * 8.314 ≈ 9.083.

Then, divide by 0.000129. So 9.083 / 0.000129 ≈ let's see. 9.083 divided by 0.0001 is 90830, but here it's divided by 0.000129, which is a bit larger than 0.0001. So approximately 9.083 / 0.000129 ≈ 70410 J/mol.

Wait, that's about 7.04 ×10^4 J/mol. Looking at the options, option G is 7.06 ×10^4 J/mole. That's very close. So the activation energy should be approximately 7.04 ×10^4 J/mol, which matches option G. 

Wait, did I make any calculation errors? Let me check the numbers again. 

1.0986 (ln3) *8.314 (R) = approx 1.0986 *8=8.789, 1.0986 *0.314≈0.345, total around 9.134. Then divide by 0.000129. 9.134 /0.000129 ≈ 70800 J/mol. Hmm, but in my earlier calculation, I had 9.083, which gave 70410. Close enough, considering rounding. So option G is the correct choice.

The correct answer is determined using the Arrhenius equation and the two-point form to relate the rate constants at two temperatures. Converting temperatures to Kelvin and solving for activation energy yields approximately 7.06 ×10⁴ J/mol, which corresponds to option G.

Answer: G
