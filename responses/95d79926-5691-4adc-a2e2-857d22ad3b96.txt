Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how the members of an arbitral tribunal are appointed. I remember that arbitration usually involves some kind of panel making decisions, but I'm not exactly sure about the details. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I know that in arbitration, the parties involved in a dispute agree to have their case heard by an impartial third party or a panel of them. The question is about who appoints these tribunal members.

Looking at the options:

Option A says all members are appointed by the parties. That makes sense because in some arbitration agreements, each party might choose one member, and then they agree on the third. But wait, I'm not sure if all members are always chosen by the parties. Sometimes, maybe there's a neutral person they both agree on, or perhaps an institution does the appointing.

Option B suggests they're appointed by an impartial third party, like the ICJ president. I think the ICJ is the International Court of Justice, which is a UN body. But isn't the ICJ more about state disputes rather than commercial arbitrations? Also, I'm not sure if the ICJ president would directly appoint arbitrators in private arbitrations. Maybe in some international cases, but is that the general rule?

Option C states that all members are chosen from a restricted list by the parties. That sounds familiar. I remember something about arbitrators being selected from a predefined list, often provided by institutions like the ICC (International Chamber of Commerce) or the LCIA. The parties pick from this list, ensuring some level of expertise and impartiality.

Wait, but what about when the parties can't agree on all members? I think in some cases, if the parties can't agree on the third member, an appointing authority, like an institution or a court, steps in. So maybe Option A isn't entirely correct because it's not always the case that all members are appointed by the parties.

Option B seems less likely because the ICJ isn't typically involved in private arbitrations. It's more about state disputes, and the process might be different.

So, putting it together: Arbitral tribunals are often formed with the parties selecting their own representatives, and then they agree on a third. Alternatively, if they can't agree, an appointing body might choose the third. But the question is about how they're appointed in general. Option C says they're chosen from a restricted list by the parties. That aligns with what I remember about arbitration rules, where a list of potential arbitrators is provided, and the parties pick from there.

Wait, but in some cases, the parties might directly appoint each other's representatives, and then the third is either co-selected or appointed by an institution. So, if the answer is C, it's because the parties choose from a restricted list, which could be provided by the arbitration institution. That makes sense because it ensures arbitrators have the necessary qualifications and expertise.

So, the correct answer is probably Option C: All the members of the arbitral tribunal are appointed by the parties from a restricted list of arbitrators.

The members of the arbitral tribunal are typically appointed by the parties involved in the dispute, often from a restricted list of qualified arbitrators provided by an arbitration institution. This ensures expertise and impartiality.
