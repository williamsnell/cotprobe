Okay, so I've got this question about work design theories, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let me start by understanding what the question is asking. It's about identifying which theoretical perspective focuses on enhancing job satisfaction and productivity. The options are A through J, each representing different theories.

First, I'll recall what each of these theories entails. I remember that job satisfaction and productivity are often linked to theories that suggest ways to make jobs more fulfilling and efficient. Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: Human Relations theory. I think this is related to how social interactions in the workplace affect productivity. It's more about the interpersonal aspects rather than the design of the job itself. So maybe not the one focused on job characteristics.

Option B: Process improvement. This seems more about the methods used to make processes better, like lean manufacturing or Six Sigma. It's about optimizing workflows, but I'm not sure it directly ties into job satisfaction.

Option C: Job enrichment theory. I remember reading that job enrichment is about adding more tasks or responsibilities to a job to make it more fulfilling. It's supposed to increase motivation and satisfaction by giving workers more variety and meaning in their tasks. That seems relevant because it's directly about enhancing the job itself to improve both satisfaction and productivity.

Option D: Job enlargement theory. This is similar to job enrichment but focuses more on increasing the number of tasks within a job rather than adding more responsibilities. So it's about expanding the scope but maybe not as much on the depth or complexity of tasks as enrichment does.

Option E: Time and Motion study. This is a method from scientific management, focusing on analyzing how workers perform tasks to reduce time waste. It's more about efficiency and task timing, not directly about job satisfaction.

Option F: Techno-structural change model. I'm a bit fuzzy on this one. I think it's about how changes in technology and structure can affect work, but not specifically about job satisfaction.

Option G: Scientific management theory. This is about breaking down tasks into smaller parts to maximize efficiency. It's more about the structure and methods rather than worker satisfaction.

Option H: Socio-technical systems. This theory looks at the relationship between social factors and technical aspects in the workplace. It aims to improve both productivity and worker well-being by considering both aspects, but I'm not sure if it's the most direct answer here.

Option I: Motivational theory. This is a broad category that includes various theories like Maslow's hierarchy or Herzberg's two-factor theory. While motivation does relate to job satisfaction, the question is about a specific work design perspective, so maybe not the best fit.

Option J: Job characteristics model. I think this model is about the core job characteristics that affect motivation and satisfaction. It includes things like skill variety, task significance, and autonomy. This model is designed to improve both job satisfaction and productivity by redesigning jobs based on these characteristics.

Wait, so the question is about which perspective focuses on enhancing both job satisfaction and productivity. Job enrichment theory (Option C) is about making jobs more satisfying by adding depth, like more responsibilities or meaningful tasks. The Job characteristics model (Option J) also deals with similar aspects, focusing on specific job features that influence satisfaction.

Hmm, I might be mixing up C and J here. Let me clarify. Job enrichment theory, as I understand it, is part of the broader job characteristics model. Or is it the other way around? Maybe Job characteristics model is a more comprehensive framework that includes concepts like autonomy, feedback, and task significance, which are all aimed at improving satisfaction and productivity.

Wait, the question is about a theoretical perspective of work design. The Job characteristics model (Option J) is specifically about job design and its impact on worker motivation and satisfaction. It's a theory that breaks down the job into characteristics that matter for employee engagement. On the other hand, Job enrichment theory (Option C) is a subset or a part of that model, focusing on increasing the depth and meaning of the job.

So maybe the correct answer is J: Job characteristics model because it's the more comprehensive theory that directly addresses job design elements to enhance satisfaction and productivity.

Alternatively, I might be confusing the two. Let me think again. The Job enrichment theory is one approach to job design that adds more tasks to make the job more satisfying. The Job characteristics model is another theory that identifies five key characteristics (autonomy, task variety, task significance, task completeness, and feedback) that lead to higher job satisfaction and motivation.

Wait, the question is about the key characteristics of a theoretical perspective. So the Job characteristics model (Option J) is the one that talks about these specific characteristics. So perhaps the answer is J.

But earlier I thought C was the answer. Now I'm getting confused. Let me look up the definitions again mentally. Job enrichment is part of the job characteristics model, which is a theory developed by Hackman and Oldham. They identified the five core job characteristics and how they affect motivation and satisfaction.

So the question is asking for the theory that focuses on enhancing job satisfaction and productivity through work design. The Job characteristics model (J) is the one that does that by redesigning jobs based on those five characteristics. Therefore, the correct answer is J.

The correct answer is J: Job characteristics model. This theory focuses on redesigning jobs to enhance job satisfaction and productivity by considering key characteristics such as autonomy, task variety, and feedback.
