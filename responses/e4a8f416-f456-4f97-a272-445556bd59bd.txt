Okay, so I need to find the inverse of the function f(x) = 4 - 5x. Hmm, I remember that finding an inverse function basically means swapping x and y and then solving for y again. Let me try to go through the steps.

First, I'll start by writing the function as y = 4 - 5x. To find the inverse, I need to switch x and y. So that would give me x = 4 - 5y. Now, my goal is to solve this equation for y.

Let me write that down: x = 4 - 5y. I want to isolate y. So, I'll subtract 4 from both sides. That would give me x - 4 = -5y. Wait, because 4 minus 5y is on the right, so subtracting 4 from both sides gives x - 4 = -5y.

Next, I need to get rid of that negative sign and the 5 multiplied by y. So, I'll divide both sides by -5. That should give me y = (x - 4) / (-5). Alternatively, I can write this as y = -(x - 4)/5, which simplifies to y = (4 - x)/5 because distributing the negative sign flips the numerator.

Looking at the options provided, let me check each one. Option A is (x-4)/5. That's close but has the same sign as the original. Option F is - (x-4)/5, which matches what I have. Option J is (4 - x)/(-5), which is the same as (x -4)/5 but with a negative denominator, which would make it -(x-4)/5, same as F but written differently. Wait, let me see. Option J is (4 - x)/(-5), which is the same as (x - 4)/5 because (4 - x) is -(x -4), so it becomes - (x-4)/ (-5) which is (x-4)/5. Wait, that might not be right. Alternatively, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, let me double-check. If I have (4 - x)/(-5), that's the same as -(4 - x)/5, which is equal to (x -4)/5. So, that's the same as option A. But earlier, I thought I had y = (4 -x)/5, which is the same as (x-4)/(-5). Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here.

Wait, let's go back. Starting from x = 4 -5y. Subtract 4: x -4 = -5y. Then, divide by -5: y = (x-4)/(-5) = -(x-4)/5. So that's the same as (4 -x)/5. Now, looking at the options, option F is - (x-4)/5, which is the same as (4 -x)/5. So both F and J might be the same, but let me check.

Option J is (4 -x)/(-5). Let me compute that: 4 -x is -(x-4), so (4 -x)/(-5) is -(x-4)/(-5) which simplifies to (x-4)/5. So that's the same as option A. Wait, but that's conflicting because I thought earlier that the inverse was -(x-4)/5, which is option F.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the signs. Let me go through it again. Starting with x = 4 -5y. So, x -4 = -5y. Then, y = (x -4)/(-5) = -(x -4)/5. So that's correct. So the inverse function is y = -(x -4)/5, which is option F.

Wait, but option J is (4 -x)/(-5), which is equal to -(4 -x)/5 = (x -4)/5, which is the same as option A. So that can't be right because when I solved for y, I ended up with -(x-4)/5, which is option F.

So, the correct inverse function is -(x-4)/5, which is option F.

Alternatively, I can think of it as f inverse of x is (4 -x)/5, but wait, that's not the same as what I derived. Because when I solve for y, I have y = (x-4)/(-5) = (4 -x)/5, which is the same as -(x-4)/5. So, perhaps both F and J are the same because (4 -x)/(-5) is the same as -(4 -x)/5, which is (x -4)/5, but that's not matching. Wait, no, that's not correct.

Wait, (4 -x)/(-5) is equal to -(4 -x)/5, which is (x -4)/5. So, that's the same as option A. But when I solved for y, I had y = (x-4)/(-5) = -(x-4)/5, which is option F. So, option F is -(x-4)/5, which is the same as (4 -x)/5. So, both F and J could look similar but in different forms.

Wait, let me check the options again. Option F is - (x-4)/5, which is -(x-4)/5. Option J is (4 -x)/(-5), which is (4 -x)/(-5) = -(4 -x)/5 = (x -4)/5. So, option J is (x-4)/5, same as option A. So, perhaps I was right the first time. The correct inverse is option F, which is -(x-4)/5. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial steps.

Wait, let me try another approach. Let me pick a value for x and see what the function and its inverse give. For example, let's say x=0. f(0) = 4 -5(0) =4. So, the point (0,4) is on f. Therefore, the inverse function should have the point (4,0). Let's check each option at x=4.

Option F: f inverse(4) = - (4 -4)/5 = -0/5 =0. So that's correct.

Option A: (4-4)/5=0, which also gives 0. So both A and F give 0 when x=4, which is correct.

Wait, but that can't be right because both can't be correct. So maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, let's try another value. Let's pick x=1. f(1)=4 -5(1)= -1. So, the point (1, -1) is on f. Therefore, the inverse function should have (-1, 1). Let's test this in options A and F.

Option A: f inverse(-1) = (-1 -4)/5 = (-5)/5 = -1. But the inverse should give 1 when x=-1. So option A gives -1, which is wrong.

Option F: f inverse(-1) = - ( (-1) -4 ) /5 = - (-5)/5 = - (-1) = 1. That's correct. So option F gives the right value, but option A does not. Therefore, the correct inverse is option F.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the inverse could be (4 -x)/5, which is the same as option F because -(x-4)/5 is the same as (4 -x)/5. So, perhaps the answer is option F.

Alternatively, looking back at the steps: y =4 -5x. Swap x and y: x=4 -5y. Solve for y: x-4= -5y â†’ y=(x-4)/(-5)= -(x-4)/5. So that's option F.

Yes, that makes sense. So the inverse function is y=-(x-4)/5, which is option F.
</think>

The inverse of the function \( f(x) = 4 - 5x \) is found by swapping \( x \) and \( y \) and solving for \( y \). Starting with \( y = 4 - 5x \), swapping gives \( x = 4 - 5y \). Solving for \( y \) yields \( y = \frac{x - 4}{-5} = -\frac{x - 4}{5} \), which matches option F.

Answer: F
