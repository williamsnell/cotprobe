Question:

This question refers to the following information.
In order to make the title of this discourse generally intelligible, I have translated the term "Protoplasm," which is the scientific name of the substance of which I am about to speak, by the words "the physical basis of life." I suppose that, to many, the idea that there is such a thing as a physical basis, or matter, of life may be novel—so widely spread is the conception of life as something which works through matter. … Thus the matter of life, so far as we know it (and we have no right to speculate on any other), breaks up, in consequence of that continual death which is the condition of its manifesting vitality, into carbonic acid, water, and nitrogenous compounds, which certainly possess no properties but those of ordinary matter.
Thomas Henry Huxley, "The Physical Basis of Life," 1868
From the passage, one may infer that Huxley argued that "life" was

Options:

A: a process that breaks down ordinary matter
B: essentially a philosophical notion
C: a term that has no physical basis
D: a concept beyond human understanding
E: merely a property of a certain kind of matter
F: a result of carbonic acid, water, and nitrogenous compounds
G: a supernatural phenomenon
H: subject to continual death and renewal
I: a complex chemical reaction
J: a force that works through matter

Okay, so I'm looking at this question about a passage from Thomas Henry Huxley's essay. The question is asking what Huxley argued about "life" based on the passage. The options are from A to J, and I need to pick the correct one.

First, I'll read the passage carefully. Huxley starts by saying he translated "Protoplasm" as "the physical basis of life." He mentions that the idea of a physical basis for life might be novel to many because people often see life as something that works through matter. Then he talks about how the matter of life breaks down into carbon dioxide, water, and nitrogenous compounds, which are ordinary matter without any special properties.

So, the key points here are that Huxley is emphasizing that life has a physical basis, specifically that the substance (protoplasm) is the physical basis. He's arguing against the notion that life is something separate from matter, working through it. Instead, he's saying that life is a property of a certain kind of matter—protoplasm. He also mentions that this matter breaks down into ordinary compounds, which suggests that even though life has these properties, it's still part of the physical world.

Looking at the options:

A: a process that breaks down ordinary matter. Hmm, the passage says that the matter of life breaks down into ordinary matter, but Huxley is arguing that life itself is the physical basis, not that life breaks down ordinary matter. So maybe not A.

B: essentially a philosophical notion. The passage seems to argue against that, as Huxley is talking about a physical basis, not philosophical. So B is probably not right.

C: a term that has no physical basis. Wait, that's the opposite. Huxley is saying life does have a physical basis, so C is wrong.

D: a concept beyond human understanding. No, he's explaining it as a physical basis, so it's within understanding.

E: merely a property of a certain kind of matter. This seems to fit because he's saying the physical basis (protoplasm) is the matter that life is a property of. So E looks correct.

F: a result of carbonic acid, water, and nitrogenous compounds. Well, those are the products when the matter breaks down, but Huxley is talking about the basis, not the result. So F is not the main point.

G: a supernatural phenomenon. He's arguing against that, so G is wrong.

H: subject to continual death and renewal. He does mention continual death as a condition for vitality, but the main argument is about the physical basis, not the cycle of death and renewal. So H is not the best fit.

I: a complex chemical reaction. He mentions compounds but doesn't frame life as a reaction, so I might not be it.

J: a force that works through matter. Again, he's countering that view, saying life is part of matter, not a force working through it.

So putting it together, the best answer is E: merely a property of a certain kind of matter. Huxley is emphasizing that life isn't something separate; it's a property of protoplasm, which is physical.

The passage argues that life has a physical basis, specifically as a property of protoplasm, and dismisses the notion of life as a separate force or phenomenon. The correct inference aligns with option E.

Answer: E
