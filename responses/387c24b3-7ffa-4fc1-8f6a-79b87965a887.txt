Question:

At a bus station, buses begin their routes at 6:00 a.m. The schedule for two of the buses is based on the time intervals listed below.
* Bus A has a long route and leavesthe station every 75 minutes.
* Bus has a short route and leaves the station every 15 minutes.
What is the next time Bus A and BusB will leave the bus station at the same time?

Options:

A: 7:00 a.m.
B: 9:00 a.m.
C: 7:15 a.m.
D: 9:30 a.m.
E: 7:30 a.m.
F: 8:15 a.m.
G: 7:45 a.m.
H: 8:00 a.m.
I: 8:30 a.m.
J: 6:45 a.m.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out when Bus A and Bus B will leave the bus station at the same time again. Both buses start their routes at 6:00 a.m. Bus A has a long route and leaves every 75 minutes, while Bus B has a short route and leaves every 15 minutes. I need to find the next time they both leave together.

Hmm, I remember something about least common multiples (LCM) being used for such problems. The LCM of their intervals should give the time when both buses coincide again. So first, I should list the intervals: Bus A is 75 minutes, Bus B is 15 minutes.

Let me break down the numbers into their prime factors to find the LCM. 75 can be factored into 3 * 5 * 5, and 15 is 3 * 5. The LCM would take the highest powers of all prime factors present, so that would be 3 * 5 * 5, which is 75. So the LCM of 75 and 15 is 75 minutes. That means 75 minutes after 6:00 a.m., both buses will leave together again.

Wait, but let me check that. If Bus B leaves every 15 minutes, then in 75 minutes, how many times does it leave? 75 divided by 15 is 5, so Bus B leaves 5 times in that period. Bus A leaves once every 75 minutes. So the first time after 6:00 a.m. they both leave together would be 75 minutes later.

Let me convert 75 minutes into hours and minutes. 75 minutes is 1 hour and 15 minutes. Adding that to 6:00 a.m. would bring us to 7:15 a.m. So the next time they both leave is at 7:15 a.m.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Maybe I should list the departure times for each bus to see when they coincide.

Bus A departs at:
6:00, then 6:00 + 75 = 7:15, then 8:30, 10:15, etc.

Bus B departs every 15 minutes starting at 6:00, so:
6:00, 6:15, 6:30, 6:45, 7:00, 7:15, 7:30, etc.

Looking at these times, the first common departure after 6:00 is indeed at 7:15 a.m. So the answer should be option C: 7:15 a.m.

The next time both buses leave together is 75 minutes after 6:00 a.m., which is 7:15 a.m.
