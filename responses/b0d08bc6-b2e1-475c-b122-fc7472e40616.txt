Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about calculating the mean ionic activity of a sodium phosphate solution. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it step by step.

Alright, the problem says the solution is 0.0350 m Na3PO4. I remember that m stands for molality, which is moles of solute per kilogram of solvent. So first, I need to figure out how this dissociates in water. Sodium phosphate, Na3PO4, is a salt that dissociates into ions. The formula breaks down into Na+ and PO4^3- ions. So the dissociation equation would be Na3PO4 → 3Na+ + PO4^3-.

Wait, right, so each formula unit of Na3PO4 produces 3 sodium ions and one phosphate ion. That means the total number of ions is 4 per formula unit. But for activity calculations, I think I need to consider the individual activities of each ion and then find their mean activity.

But wait, the question is about the mean ionic activity. Oh, right, the mean ionic activity (a±) is calculated using the formula a± = γ± (m_i), where γ± is the mean activity coefficient, and m_i is the ionic strength of the solution. Alternatively, sometimes I might have to compute the ionic strength first, but perhaps in this case, since we're given the activity coefficient, it's a different approach.

Wait, no, I think I might have confused some steps here. Let me get this straight. The mean ionic activity is given by the formula a± = γ± * (m_i), where m_i is the ionic strength. But wait, wait, no, maybe it's more about the contribution of each ion's activity.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for mean ionic activity is (sum of (concentration * charge squared))^(1/2), but I'm not sure. Wait, no, that's the formula for ionic strength, I think. Ionic strength (I) is calculated as I = 1/2 * sum(c_i * z_i^2), where c_i is the concentration of each ion and z_i is its charge.

Wait, but in this problem, they're asking for the mean ionic activity, which might be different. Oh wait, no, perhaps I'm mixing things up. Let me see: the mean ionic activity is the geometric mean of the activities of the ions, each raised to the power of their stoichiometric coefficients. So for Na3PO4, which dissociates into 3 Na+ and 1 PO4^3-, the mean ionic activity (a±) is the cube root of (activity_Na+^3 * activity_PO4^3-).

But wait, the activity of each ion is given by a_i = γ_i * (m_i), where γ_i is the activity coefficient for that ion, and m_i is its molality. But wait, in this problem, we're given the mean activity coefficient, which I think is the same as γ±, the mean activity coefficient for the ions in the solution.

So perhaps the formula for the mean ionic activity (a±) is a± = γ± * (sum (ν_i * m_i)) / Σν_i, where ν_i are the stoichiometric coefficients. Wait, not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's simply the product of the activity coefficients and the ionic contributions.

Alternatively, perhaps the mean ionic activity is calculated as a± = γ± * (m_i), but wait, m_i here would be the ionic concentration considering the number of ions. Wait, no, perhaps the ionic strength is involved, but I'm getting a bit confused here.

Let me try to approach this methodically. First, find the ionic strength (I) of the solution, then use that to find the mean activity coefficient (γ±), but wait, no, because the activity coefficient is already given as 0.685. Oh wait, no, the activity coefficient is given, so perhaps I can use it directly.

Wait, but the problem is to find the mean ionic activity, which is a± = γ± * sqrt(I), where I is the ionic strength. Or is it the other way around? Hmm, maybe I should calculate the ionic strength first.

So, the solution is 0.0350 m Na3PO4. Let me write down the dissociation again: Na3PO4 → 3 Na+ + PO4^3-. So each mole of Na3PO4 produces 3 moles of Na+ and 1 mole of PO4^3-.

Therefore, the molality of Na+ is 3 * 0.0350 m = 0.105 m. The molality of PO4^3- is 1 * 0.0350 m = 0.0350 m.

Ionic strength I is calculated as I = 1/2 * [sum (m_i * z_i^2)].

So for Na+:
m_i = 0.105 m, z_i = +1. So z_i^2 = 1.

For PO4^3-:
m_i = 0.0350 m, z_i = -3. So z_i^2 = 9.

So I = 1/2 * [ (0.105 * 1) + (0.035 * 9) ) ] 

Let me compute that:

0.105 *1 = 0.105
0.035 *9 = 0.315
Sum = 0.105 + 0.315 = 0.420
I = 0.5 * 0.420 = 0.210 m.

Wait, that can't be right because 0.105 + 0.315 is 0.420, and half of that is 0.210. Hmm, but that would make I = 0.210 m.

Wait, but I've heard that ionic strength is often in the range of 0.1 to 0.5 for typical solutions. 0.21 seems reasonable.

Now, the mean activity coefficient γ± is given as 0.685. So the mean ionic activity a± is calculated as a± = γ± * sqrt(I), but wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, I think the formula for the mean ionic activity is a± = γ± * (m_i), where m_i is the molality of the ions. But I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps the mean ionic activity is a± = γ± multiplied by the ionic concentration, which is the total concentration of ions. But maybe that's not right. Alternatively, the mean ionic activity is calculated as the sum of the individual ionic activities, each raised to their stoichiometric coefficients, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the formula is a± = γ± * (sum (ν_i * m_i)) / Σν_i. Let me think. For Na3PO4, each formula unit gives 3 Na+ and 1 PO4^3-. So the total number of ions per formula unit is 4. So the mean ionic charge or something?

Wait, perhaps the mean ionic activity is calculated using the formula a± = (a_Na+^3 * a_PO4^3- )^(1/4), since there are 3 Na+ and 1 PO4^3-.

But the activity of each ion is a_i = γ_i * m_i, but wait, each ion's activity coefficient is different, but sometimes people use the mean activity coefficient γ± for all ions. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, some sources say that the mean ionic activity is a± = γ± * sqrt( (sum (ν_i^2 * z_i^2 * m_i )) / (ν_total) )

Wait, maybe I should find the ionic strength first, then calculate a± using the formula a± = γ± * sqrt(I), but wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Because I is the ionic strength, which is related to the activity coefficient. Alternatively, perhaps the mean ionic activity is γ± multiplied by the square root of the ionic strength.

Wait, no, that can't be right because the activity coefficient is already a function of the ionic strength. So I think perhaps the mean ionic activity is a± = γ± * sqrt( (sum (ν_i * m_i * z_i^2 )) / (ν_total) )

Wait, let me think again. The ionic strength I is 1/2 * sum (m_i * z_i^2), which we calculated as 0.210 m.

But the mean ionic activity is given by a± = γ± * (I)^0.5. Wait, no, that would be the same as the mean activity coefficient times the square root of the ionic strength. But I'm not sure if that's correct.

Alternatively, another approach: the mean ionic activity (a±) is the geometric mean of the activities of the individual ions, each raised to the power of their stoichiometric coefficients. So for Na3PO4, which dissociates into 3 Na+ and 1 PO4^3-, the mean ionic activity would be:

a± = (a_Na+^3 * a_PO4^3- )^(1/4)

Since there are 4 ions in total (3 Na+ and 1 PO4^3-), the exponents sum to 4, so the 4th root.

But each a_i is equal to γ_i * m_i, but since the activity coefficients for each ion may differ, but in the problem, we're given the mean activity coefficient γ±, which is 0.685. So perhaps we can assume γ_Na+ = γ_PO4 = γ±, which isn't strictly true, but maybe for this problem, we're supposed to use the given γ± for all ions.

Alternatively, perhaps the mean activity coefficient γ± is the geometric mean of the individual activity coefficients, weighted by their stoichiometric coefficients.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck here. Let me try a different approach.

The solution is 0.0350 m Na3PO4. So the contribution to the molality of each ion is as follows:

Na3PO4 → 3 Na+ + PO4^3-
So Na+ concentration is 3 * 0.0350 = 0.105 m
PO4^3- concentration is 1 * 0.0350 = 0.0350 m

The ionic strength I is 1/2 [ (0.105)(1)^2 + (0.0350)(3)^2 ]

Which is 1/2 [ 0.105 *1 + 0.0350 *9 ] = 1/2 [0.105 + 0.315] = 1/2 * 0.420 = 0.210 m.

Now, the mean activity coefficient is given as 0.685. The mean ionic activity a± is calculated using the formula a± = γ± * (m_i), where m_i is the molality of the ions in terms of their charge. Wait, no, perhaps it's γ± multiplied by the square root of the ionic strength? Because I remember that the Debye-Hückel limiting law relates the activity coefficient to the square root of the ionic strength, but that's more for calculating γ± from I, not the other way around.

Wait, but in this problem, we're given γ± and need to find a±. So perhaps the formula is a± = γ± * sqrt(I). Let's test that.

I is 0.210 m, so sqrt(0.210) ≈ 0.45837.

Then a± = 0.685 * 0.45837 ≈ 0.685 * 0.45837.

Let me compute that:

0.685 * 0.45837 ≈ 0.685 * 0.458 ≈ approximately 0.313.

Wait, but looking at the options, the highest is 0.0905, so that can't be right. So I must have made a mistake in my approach.

Hmm, perhaps I'm confusing the formula. Let me think again: the mean ionic activity is related to the activity coefficients and the concentrations of the ions.

Wait, another approach: the mean ionic activity (a±) can be calculated using the formula a± = γ± * (m_i), where m_i is the equivalent concentration, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, perhaps m_i here refers to the ionic concentration, considering the charge. Alternatively, maybe it's the sum of the products of concentration and charge squared, but divided by the total number of ions.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the ionic strength I as we did before, which is 0.210 m. Then, the mean ionic activity is given by a± = γ± * sqrt(I). Wait, but that would be 0.685 * sqrt(0.210) ≈ 0.685 * 0.458 ≈ 0.313, which as I saw earlier is not among the options. So maybe this approach is wrong.

Wait, perhaps the mean ionic activity is simply the product of the activity coefficients and the concentrations of the ions, each raised to their stoichiometric coefficients.

So for Na3PO4, the formula is:

a± = (a_Na+^3 * a_PO4^3-) )^(1/4)

Where a_Na+ = γ_Na+ * m_Na+ and a_PO4^3- = γ_PO4 * m_PO4.

But we only have the mean activity coefficient γ±, which is 0.685. But the individual γ values for Na+ and PO4^3- might be different. So without knowing the individual γ values, I can't proceed this way. Hmm, perhaps the problem assumes that γ_Na+ = γ_PO4 = γ±, which is 0.685. But that's an approximation and might not be accurate, but perhaps acceptable for this problem.

So if I proceed with that assumption, then:

a_Na+ = 0.685 * 0.105 m
a_PO4^3- = 0.685 * 0.0350 m

Then, a± = [ (a_Na+)^3 * (a_PO4^3-) ) ]^(1/4)

Let me compute each activity:

a_Na+ = 0.685 * 0.105 ≈ 0.071925
a_PO4^3- = 0.685 * 0.035 ≈ 0.023975

Now, (a_Na+)^3 ≈ (0.071925)^3 ≈ 0.071925 * 0.071925 = 0.005174; then 0.005174 * 0.071925 ≈ approximately 0.000370.

a_PO4^3- ≈ 0.023975.

Now, multiply (a_Na+)^3 by a_PO4^3-: 0.000370 * 0.023975 ≈ 8.873e-6.

Take the fourth root of this product: (8.873e-6)^(1/4).

Hmm, let me compute that. Let's take the natural log: ln(8.873e-6) ≈ ln(8.873) + ln(1e-6) ≈ 2.184 + (-13.8155) ≈ -11.6315.

Divide by 4: -11.6315 / 4 ≈ -2.9079.

Exponentiate: e^(-2.9079) ≈ 0.0547.

So a± ≈ 0.0547.

Looking at the options, option I is 0.0547. So that would be the answer.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make an error.

Compute a_Na+ = 0.685 * 0.105 = 0.071925.

a_PO4^3- = 0.685 * 0.035 = 0.023975.

(a_Na+)^3 = (0.071925)^3.

Let's compute 0.071925^3:

0.071925 * 0.071925 = 0.005174.

0.005174 * 0.071925 ≈ 0.000371.

a_PO4^3- = 0.023975.

Multiply them: 0.000371 * 0.023975 ≈ 0.000371 * 0.024 ≈ 0.000008904.

Wait, that's 8.904e-6.

Take the 4th root: (8.904e-6)^(1/4).

Let me compute this differently. Let me take the fourth root of 8.904e-6.

Alternatively, since 1e-6 is (1e-3)^2, and the fourth root of 1e-6 is 1e-3 * sqrt(1e-3), but maybe it's easier to compute it as follows.

Compute the fourth root of 8.904e-6.

We can write it as (8.904)^(1/4) * (1e-6)^(1/4).

1e-6^(1/4) = (1e-6)^(0.25) = 1e-1.5 = 0.031623.

(8.904)^(1/4) ≈ e^(ln(8.904)/4) ≈ ln(8.904)=2.187, divided by 4 is 0.5467. e^0.5467 ≈ 1.728.

So 1.728 * 0.031623 ≈ 0.0547.

Yes, that gives approximately 0.0547, which matches option I.

So the answer should be I: 0.0547.

To calculate the mean ionic activity of a $0.0350 \, \mathrm{m} \, \mathrm{Na}_3\mathrm{PO}_4$ solution with a mean activity coefficient of $0.685$, we proceed as follows:

1. **Dissociation of Na₃PO₄**:  
   $\mathrm{Na}_3\mathrm{PO}_4 \rightarrow 3\mathrm{Na}^+ + \mathrm{PO}_4^{3-}$.  
   Each mole of $\mathrm{Na}_3\mathrm{PO}_4$ produces 3 moles of $\mathrm{Na}^+$ and 1 mole of $\mathrm{PO}_4^{3-}$.

2. **Concentrations of Ions**:  
   - $\mathrm{Na}^+$ concentration: $3 \times 0.0350 = 0.105 \, \mathrm{m}$.  
   - $\mathrm{PO}_4^{3-}$ concentration: $1 \times 0.0350 = 0.0350 \, \mathrm{m}$.

3. **Ionic Strength ($I$)**:  
   The ionic strength is calculated as:  
   \[
   I = \frac{1}{2} \left( \nu_{\mathrm{Na}^+} \cdot m_{\mathrm{Na}^+} \cdot z_{\mathrm{Na}^+}^2 + \nu_{\mathrm{PO}_4^{3-}} \cdot m_{\mathrm{PO}_4^{3-}} \cdot z_{\mathrm{PO}_4^{3-}}^2 \right)
   \]  
   Substituting values:  
   \[
   I = \frac{1}{2} \left( 0.105 \cdot 1^2 + 0.0350 \cdot 3^2 \right) = \frac{1}{2} \left( 0.105 + 0.315 \right) = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0.420 = 0.210 \, \mathrm{m}.
   \]

4. **Mean Ionic Activity ($a^\pm$)**:  
   The mean ionic activity is given by:  
   \[
   a^\pm = \gamma^\pm \cdot \sqrt{I},
   \]  
   where $\gamma^\pm = 0.685$ and $I = 0.210 \, \mathrm{m}$.  
   Substituting values:  
   \[
   a^\pm = 0.685 \cdot \sqrt{0.210} \approx 0.685 \cdot 0.458 = 0.313.
   \]  
   However, this value does not match any of the provided options, indicating a miscalculation.

5. **Alternative Approach Using Ionic Activity**:  
   The mean ionic activity can also be calculated using the formula:  
   \[
   a^\pm = \left( a_{\mathrm{Na}^+}^3 \cdot a_{\mathrm{PO}_4^{3-}} \right)^{1/4},
   \]  
   where $a_{\mathrm{Na}^+} = \gamma_{\mathrm{Na}^+} \cdot m_{\mathrm{Na}^+}$ and $a_{\mathrm{PO}_4^{3-}} = \gamma_{\mathrm{PO}_4^{3-}} \cdot m_{\mathrm{PO}_4^{3-}}$. Assuming $\gamma_{\mathrm{Na}^+} = \gamma_{\mathrm{PO}_4^{3-}} = \gamma^\pm = 0.685$:  
   \[
   a_{\mathrm{Na}^+} = 0.685 \cdot 0.105 \approx 0.0719, \quad a_{\mathrm{PO}_4^{3-}} = 0.685 \cdot 0.0350 \approx 0.02398.
   \]  
   Substituting into the formula:  
   \[
   a^\pm = \left( (0.0719)^3 \cdot 0.02398 \right)^{1/4}.
   \]  
   Compute $(0.0719)^3 \approx 0.000371$ and $0.000371 \cdot 0.02398 \approx 8.873 \times 10^{-6}$. Taking the fourth root:  
   \[
   a^\pm \approx (8.873 \times 10^{-6})^{1/4} \approx 0.0547.
   \]

Thus, the mean ionic activity is approximately $0.0547$, corresponding to option **I**.

Answer: I
