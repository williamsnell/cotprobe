Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the ionization constant, Ka, for a weak monoprotic acid. The problem states that a 0.060 molar solution has a pH of 2.0. Hmm, I remember that pH is related to the concentration of hydrogen ions in the solution. 

First, I think I should start by finding the hydrogen ion concentration. I know that pH is the negative logarithm of [H+], so [H+] equals 10^-pH. In this case, pH is 2, so [H+] should be 10^-2, which is 0.01 M. That makes sense because a lower pH means a higher concentration of H+ ions.

Wait, but this is a weak acid, so it doesn't completely ionize. The acid HA dissociates into H+ and A- ions. Since it's monoprotic, each molecule can only donate one proton. The initial concentration of the acid is 0.060 M, and the change due to dissociation is what I need to find.

Let me set up the dissociation equation:
HA ⇌ H+ + A-
The initial concentrations are [HA] = 0.060 M, [H+] = 0, and [A-] = 0. The change would be -x for HA, +x for H+, and +x for A-. At equilibrium, [HA] is 0.060 - x, [H+] is x, and [A-] is x.

But wait, from the pH, I already know that [H+] is 0.01 M, which equals x. So x is 0.01. Therefore, the equilibrium concentrations are [H+] = 0.01 M, [A-] = 0.01 M, and [HA] = 0.060 - 0.01 = 0.05 M.

Now, the ionization constant Ka is given by the formula:
Ka = [H+][A-] / [HA]

Plugging in the numbers:
Ka = (0.01)(0.01) / 0.05

Calculating that, 0.01 times 0.01 is 0.0001, and dividing by 0.05 gives 0.002. Wait, 0.002 is 2.0 × 10^-3. Looking at the options, that's option B.

Wait, but let me double-check. Did I make any mistakes? I assumed that x equals [H+] from the pH, which should be correct because the acid is weak and only partially ionizes. So yes, x is 0.01 M.

Another way to think about it: if the initial concentration of the acid is much higher than the [H+], then the approximation holds that x is much smaller than 0.060, which it is (since 0.01 is much less than 0.06). So the calculation seems right.

So the Ka is 2.0 × 10^-3, which is option B.

The ionization constant \( K_a \) for the weak monoprotic acid can be determined by first calculating the hydrogen ion concentration from the given pH. Since \( \text{pH} = 2 \), the hydrogen ion concentration is \( [\text{H}^+] = 10^{-2} = 0.01 \, \text{M} \). 

For the dissociation of the weak acid \( \text{HA} \) into \( \text{H}^+ \) and \( \text{A}^- \), the equilibrium concentrations are:
- \( [\text{H}^+] = 0.01 \, \text{M} \)
- \( [\text{A}^-] = 0.01 \, \text{M} \)
- \( [\text{HA}] = 0.060 - 0.01 = 0.05 \, \text{M} \).

Using the formula for \( K_a \):
\[
K_a = \frac{[\text{H}^+][\text{A}^-]}{[\text{HA}]} = \frac{(0.01)(0.01)}{0.05} = \frac{0.0001}{0.05} = 0.002 = 2.0 \times 10^{-3}.
\]

Thus, the ionization constant \( K_a \) is \( 2.0 \times 10^{-3} \), which corresponds to option B.

Answer: B
