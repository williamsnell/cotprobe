Okay, so I have this problem where I need to express the result of 6,400,000 divided by 400 in scientific notation. Hmm, scientific notation usually involves a number between 1 and 10 multiplied by a power of 10. Let me start by doing the division first.

So, 6,400,000 divided by 400. Let me write that down: 6,400,000 / 400. Hmm, maybe I can simplify this by canceling zeros. Both numbers have three zeros at the end. Wait, 6,400,000 is 6.4 million, which is 6,400,000. And 400 is 4 times 100. Alternatively, I can think of it as 6,400,000 divided by 400 equals (6,400,000 ÷ 100) ÷ 4, right? Because 400 is 4 times 100.

So, 6,400,000 ÷ 100 is 64,000. Then, 64,000 ÷ 4 is 16,000. Wait, that seems straightforward. So, the result is 16,000. Now, I need to write 16,000 in scientific notation.

In scientific notation, numbers are written as a × 10^b, where 1 ≤ a < 10. So, 16,000 is 1.6 × 10,000. Wait, 10,000 is 10^4. So that would be 1.6 × 10^4. Let me check that: 1.6 times 10,000 is indeed 16,000.

Looking at the options, option I is 1.6 × 10^4. So that should be the correct choice. Alternatively, I could have approached the division differently. Let me check another way to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

6,400,000 divided by 400. Let's write both numbers in scientific notation first. 6,400,000 is 6.4 × 10^6 because moving the decimal six places to the left gives 6.4. And 400 is 4 × 10^2. So when I divide, I subtract the exponents: 10^(6-2) = 10^4. Then, I divide 6.4 by 4, which is 1.6. So again, I get 1.6 × 10^4, which is option I.

Wait, did I consider all the options? Let me look again. Option A is 6.4 × 10^4. Oh, that's 64,000, which is not the same as 16,000. So A is incorrect. Option I is 1.6 × 10^4, which is 16,000. Yes, that's correct. So I'm confident that I is the right answer.

The result of dividing 6,400,000 by 400 is 16,000. Expressed in scientific notation, this is 1.6 × 10^4.

Answer: I
