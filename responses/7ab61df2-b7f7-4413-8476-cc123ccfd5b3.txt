Okay, so I've got this question about real estate taxes, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

First, the question says that Mr. Golden owns property with a market value of $16,500. The property is in a city where the assessed valuation is 40% of the actual value. The tax rate is 21.3 mills per dollar. I need to find out how much he pays in real estate taxes.

Hmm, let's break this down. I remember that assessed valuation is usually a percentage of the market value. So, the first thing I need to do is calculate the assessed value of the property. The market value is $16,500, and the assessment is 40%, right?

So, the assessed value would be 40% of $16,500. To calculate that, I can multiply 16,500 by 0.4. Let me do that: 16,500 * 0.4 equals... 6,600. So, the assessed value is $6,600.

Wait, no, wait. Wait a second. Sometimes, I get confused between assessed value and taxable value. But in this case, the question says the assessed valuation is 40% of the actual value, so that should be the taxable base. So, yes, $6,600 is the assessed value.

Next, the tax rate is 21.3 mills per dollar. Mills are a unit of tax rate, right? One mill is equal to 1/1000 of a dollar, or $0.001 per dollar of assessed value. So, 21.3 mills would be 21.3 * 0.001, which is 0.0213.

So the tax rate is 0.0213 per dollar of assessed value. Now, to find the total tax, I multiply the assessed value by the tax rate. So that's $6,600 * 0.0213.

Let me calculate that. Hmm, 6,600 times 0.02 is 132, and 6,600 times 0.0013 is... let's see, 6,600 * 0.001 is 6.6, so 0.0013 would be 6.6 * 1.3, which is 8.58.

So adding those together: 132 + 8.58 equals 140.58. So the tax would be $140.58.

Wait, let me double-check that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Alternatively, I can do 6,600 * 21.3 mills.

Wait, 21.3 mills is 21.3 per thousand, so 21.3/1000 = 0.0213. So, 6,600 * 0.0213.

Another way: 6,600 * 21.3 = ?

Wait, because 21.3 per thousand, so perhaps it's easier to compute 6,600 * 21.3 first, then divide by 1000.

Let's try that. 6,600 * 21.3.

Breaking it down: 6,600 * 20 = 132,000; 6,600 * 1.3 = 8,580. So total is 132,000 + 8,580 = 140,580. Then divide by 1000, which gives 140.58. Yep, same result.

So the tax is $140.58. Looking at the options, H is $140.58. So the answer should be H.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any miscalculations. Let me go through each step again.

1. Market value: $16,500.
2. Assessed value is 40% of market value: 0.4 * 16,500 = 6,600. Correct.
3. Tax rate: 21.3 mills = 21.3/1000 = 0.0213.
4. Tax = Assessed value * tax rate: 6,600 * 0.0213.

Calculating 6,600 * 0.0213: 

Let me compute 6,600 * 0.02 = 132.

Then 6,600 * 0.0013: 6,600 * 0.001 = 6.6; 6.6 * 1.3 = 8.58.

Adding 132 + 8.58 gives 140.58. Yep, that's correct.

So the correct answer is H: $140.58.

The assessed value is 40% of $16,500, which is $6,600. The tax rate is 21.3 mills, equivalent to 0.0213 per dollar. Multiplying $6,600 by 0.0213 gives $140.58 in taxes.

Answer: H
