Okay, so I have this physics problem here about calculating the de Broglie wavelength of an alpha particle emitted by radioactive radium. Hmm, I remember the de Broglie wavelength formula is lambda equals h over p, where h is Planck's constant and p is momentum. Right, so I need to find the momentum of the alpha particle first.

The problem gives me the energy of the alpha particle as 4.8 MeV. Wait, energy and momentum are related, but since it's given as kinetic energy, I think I can find the momentum using that. Oh wait, but the energy here is total energy, not just kinetic? Or is it just kinetic? I think alpha particles are moving at speeds where relativistic effects are negligible, so maybe I can approximate it as non-relativistic. Or perhaps it's better to use the relation between kinetic energy and momentum in non-relativistic terms.

So, for non-relativistic speeds, the kinetic energy (K) is (p²)/(2m), where p is momentum and m is mass. So I can rearrange that to find p. That would make p equal to sqrt(2mK). Alternatively, K = (p²)/(2m) → p = sqrt(2mK). Wait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me think again. Oh right, p squared over (2m) equals K, so p is sqrt(2mK). Yeah, that's right.

Given that, I need to calculate p using the mass of the alpha particle and its kinetic energy. The mass is given as 6.6 x 10^-24 grams. And the energy is 4.8 MeV. I need to convert everything into compatible units because the constants provided are in different units.

The given constants are: h = 6.6 x 10^-27 erg·sec, and 1 MeV = 1.6 x 10^-6 erg. Also, 1 erg is 1 g·cm²/s². 

So, first, let me convert the energy from MeV to ergs. 4.8 MeV multiplied by 1.6e-6 erg/MeV. Let me compute that: 4.8 * 1.6e-6 = 7.68e-6 erg. So K = 7.68e-6 erg.

Now, the mass is 6.6e-24 grams. I need to compute p = sqrt(2 * m * K). Let me plug in the numbers:

p = sqrt(2 * 6.6e-24 g * 7.68e-6 erg)

Wait, but erg is g·cm²/s². So when I multiply m (in grams) by K (in erg), I get g*(g cm²/s²) → g² cm²/s²? Wait, no, wait. Let me think about the units. K is in ergs, which is energy. m is in grams. So 2*m*K would have units of g*(erg) → g*(g cm²/s²) → g² cm²/s². Hmm, but that's not matching for p^2. Because p has units of g·cm/s. So p squared would be g² cm²/s². So yes, the units match.

So let's compute the value inside the square root: 2 * 6.6e-24 g * 7.68e-6 erg.

Calculating that: 2 * 6.6e-24 = 1.32e-23. Then multiply by 7.68e-6 → 1.32e-23 * 7.68e-6 = let's see, 1.32 *7.68 ≈ 10.1376, and the exponents are 10^-23 * 10^-6 = 10^-29. So 10.1376e-29 → 1.01376e-28.

Wait, wait, no. Because 1.32e-23 *7.68e-6 = (1.32 *7.68) * 1e-23 * 1e-6 = (about 10.1376) * 1e-29. So that's 1.01376e-28. So the square root of that would be sqrt(1.01376e-28) → approximately sqrt(1.01376) * 1e-14. The square root of 1.01376 is about 1.00687, so roughly 1.00687e-14. So p ≈ 1.00687e-14 g·cm/s.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check the calculation again. 6.6e-24 *7.68e-6 is 6.6 *7.68 = about 50.688, times 1e-24 *1e-6 = 1e-30. So 50.688e-30 = 5.0688e-29. Then multiply by 2: 2 *5.0688e-29 = 1.01376e-28. Yep, same as before.

So p ≈ sqrt(1.01376e-28) → sqrt(1.01376) is about 1.00687, so 1.00687e-14 g·cm/s. So p ≈ 1.00687e-14 g·cm/s.

Now, the de Broglie wavelength is lambda = h / p. Given h is 6.6e-27 erg·sec. Let me make sure the units are compatible. Since p is in g·cm/s, and h is erg·sec which is g·cm²/s² * s → g·cm²/s. Wait, no: 1 erg is 1 g·cm²/s². So h = 6.6e-27 erg·s = 6.6e-27 (g·cm²/s²) * s → 6.6e-27 g·cm²/s.

So h has units of g·cm²/s, and p is g·cm/s. So when I divide h by p, the units would be (g·cm²/s) / (g·cm/s) )= cm. So that's correct.

So lambda = h / p = (6.6e-27 g·cm²/s) / (1.00687e-14 g·cm/s) ) → The grams and cm cancel out, leaving seconds in denominator? Wait, let me compute the numbers.

6.6e-27 / 1.00687e-14 = (6.6 / 1.00687) * 1e-27+14 → 6.6 / ~1 ≈ 6.6, so 6.6 * 1e-13 → 6.6e-13 cm. Wait, but wait, 1e-27 divided by 1e-14 is 1e-13. So lambda ≈ 6.6e-13 cm.

Wait, but wait, that would be option F: 6.6 × 10^-13 cm. But looking at the options, option F is indeed 6.6e-13 cm. However, I'm a bit concerned because in some cases, alpha particles have relativistic speeds, and using non-relativistic momentum might not be accurate. But given the problem provides the energy as 4.8 MeV, which is much less than the rest mass energy of an alpha particle. Wait, what's the rest mass of an alpha particle? An alpha is a helium nucleus, so about 4 atomic mass units. 1 atomic mass unit is about 931 MeV/c². So 4 *931 = 3724 MeV. So 4.8 MeV is way less than that, so non-relativistic approximation should be okay.

Wait a second, but another approach is to use the relation E² = (pc c)^2 + (m c²)^2. But that's the relativistic equation. Since the energy given is 4.8 MeV, which is the kinetic energy plus rest energy. Wait no, actually, the energy here is the total energy including rest mass. Wait, no. Typically, when the problem says the energy of a particle, it's kinetic energy unless stated otherwise. Or sometimes, it's the total energy. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me read the question again. It says "energy of 4.8 MeV." Hmm, sometimes, in particle physics, energy refers to kinetic energy, but sometimes it refers to total energy. But given that 4.8 MeV is much less than the rest mass energy, it's more likely that this is the kinetic energy. But just to be thorough, perhaps I should check both approaches.

Wait, but the problem is giving the energy as 4.8 MeV, which is the kinetic energy. Because for the alpha particles from radium, the typical energies are in the MeV range, which are their kinetic energies. So I think the initial approach is correct.

Wait, but let me try using the relativistic formula to see if the answer changes significantly. If E is the total energy, then E² = (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2. But since c is a large number, and in these units, perhaps it's better to express everything in c=1 units? Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the momentum in terms of E and m.

Wait, but maybe it's easier to compute the momentum using E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2 ). So if E is given as 4.8 MeV, which is the total energy, then p = sqrt( E² - (m c²)^2 ) / c. But wait, I'm getting confused with the units. Alternatively, let's compute the total energy E as 4.8 MeV, and the rest mass energy is m c². So m is 6.6e-24 grams. Let's compute m c².

But wait, in cgs units, c is 3e10 cm/s. So m c² would be in ergs. Let's compute that: m = 6.6e-24 g. c^2 is (3e10 cm/s)^2 = 9e20 cm²/s². So m c² = 6.6e-24 g * 9e20 cm²/s² = 6.6e-24 *9e20 = 59.4e-4 = 5.94e-3 erg. Because 1 erg is 1 g·cm²/s², so m c² is 5.94e-3 erg.

Now, the total energy E is 4.8 MeV, which is 4.8 *1.6e-6 erg =7.68e-6 erg. So E is 7.68e-6 erg, and m c² is 5.94e-3 erg. So E² = (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2 → (pc)^2 = E² - (m c²)^2 → pc = sqrt(E² - (m c²)^2). So let's compute that.

E = 7.68e-6 erg
m c² =5.94e-3 erg

E² = (7.68e-6)^2 = ~5.9e-11 erg²
(m c²)^2 = (5.94e-3)^2 ≈ 3.53e-5 erg²

So E² - (m c²)^2 ≈ 5.9e-11 -3.53e-5 → Wait, that's a negative number because 3.53e-5 is larger than 5.9e-11. That can't be right. That would mean that E < m c², which is impossible because then the particle wouldn't exist. So this suggests that the given energy of 4.8 MeV is the kinetic energy, not the total energy. Because if E were the total energy, it's way larger than m c², but in this case, 4.8 MeV is about 7.68e-6 erg, which is much less than m c² of 5.94e-3 erg (which is 5940 eV, about 5.94 keV). So 4.8 MeV is 4800 keV, which is bigger than 5.94 keV. Wait, wait a second, I think I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, 4.8 MeV is 4.8 million eV. 1 eV is 1.6e-12 erg. So 4.8 MeV is 4.8e6 eV *1.6e-12 erg/eV = 7.68e-6 erg. Oh wait, that's correct. And m c² is 5.94e-3 erg, which is 5940 eV or 5.94 keV. So 4.8 MeV is 4800 keV, which is more than 5.94 keV. So E (total energy) would be K + m c² =4.8 MeV + 5.94 keV ≈ 4.80594 MeV. So E is about 4.80594 MeV, which is 4.80594e6 eV *1.6e-12 erg/eV = 7.6895e-6 erg.

So let's compute E² - (m c²)^2:

E² = (7.6895e-6 erg)^2 ≈ (7.6895e-6)^2 = approx 5.91e-11 erg²

(m c²)^2 = (5.94e-3 erg)^2 ≈ 3.528e-5 erg²

So E² - (m c²)^2 = 5.91e-11 - 3.528e-5 ≈ -3.527e-5 erg². Wait, that can't be right because that's negative, which would imply imaginary momentum, which is impossible. So this suggests that treating E as the total energy is incorrect. Therefore, E must be the kinetic energy, and the initial approach using non-relativistic momentum is correct.

So I'll proceed with the initial approach where p = sqrt(2 m K), and lambda = h / p.

So earlier calculation gave me lambda ≈ 6.6e-13 cm, which is option F. But looking at the options:

Option F is 6.6 × 10^-13 cm.

But wait, let me recheck the calculation because perhaps I made a mistake in the units. Let me go through it again.

Calculating K: 4.8 MeV =4.8 *1.6e-6 erg =7.68e-6 erg.

Mass m =6.6e-24 g.

p = sqrt(2 * m * K) → sqrt(2 *6.6e-24 g *7.68e-6 erg).

Wait, but erg is g·cm²/s². So m * K has units g * (g·cm²/s²) )= g² cm²/s².

Wait, so 2*m*K is 2 *6.6e-24 g *7.68e-6 erg → but wait, 7.68e-6 erg is in terms of energy, which is g·cm²/s². So 6.6e-24 g *7.68e-6 g·cm²/s² = (6.6e-24)(7.68e-6) g² cm²/s². Multiply by 2: 2 *6.6e-24 *7.68e-6 = 2 *5.0688e-29 =1.01376e-28 g² cm²/s².

Taking square root gives p = sqrt(1.01376e-28) = approx 1.00687e-14 g cm/s.

Now, h is 6.6e-27 erg s. To convert erg to g cm²/s², h is 6.6e-27 g cm²/s.

So lambda = h / p = (6.6e-27 g cm²/s) / (1.00687e-14 g cm/s) )= (6.6e-27 /1.00687e-14) cm.

Calculating the division: 6.6 /1.00687 ≈6.55, so 6.55e-13 cm. So approximately 6.55e-13 cm, which is 6.55 ×10^-13 cm. Looking at the options, option F is 6.6 ×10^-13 cm, which is very close. So the answer should be F.

To calculate the de Broglie wavelength of the alpha particle, we use the formula:

\[
\lambda = \frac{h}{p}
\]

where \( h \) is Planck's constant and \( p \) is the momentum of the particle. The momentum \( p \) can be derived from the kinetic energy \( K \) using the non-relativistic relation:

\[
p = \sqrt{2mK}
\]

### Step 1: Convert the energy to ergs
The energy of the alpha particle is given as \( 4.8 \, \text{MeV} \). Using the conversion \( 1 \, \text{MeV} = 1.6 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{erg} \):

\[
K = 4.8 \times 1.6 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{erg} = 7.68 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{erg}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the momentum \( p \)
The mass of the alpha particle is \( m = 6.6 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{g} \). Substituting into the momentum formula:

\[
p = \sqrt{2 \cdot m \cdot K} = \sqrt{2 \cdot (6.6 \times 10^{-24}) \cdot (7.68 \times 10^{-6})}
\]

First, calculate the product inside the square root:

\[
2 \cdot 6.6 \times 10^{-24} \cdot 7.68 \times 10^{-6} = 1.01376 \times 10^{-28}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
p = \sqrt{1.01376 \times 10^{-28}} \approx 1.00687 \times 10^{-14} \, \text{g·cm/s}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the de Broglie wavelength \( \lambda \)
Planck's constant is \( h = 6.6 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{erg·s} \). Substituting \( h \) and \( p \) into the wavelength formula:

\[
\lambda = \frac{h}{p} = \frac{6.6 \times 10^{-27}}{1.00687 \times 10^{-14}} \, \text{cm}
\]

Performing the division:

\[
\lambda \approx 6.55 \times 10^{-13} \, \text{cm}
\]

### Step 4: Match the result to the options
The closest option to \( 6.55 \times 10^{-13} \, \text{cm} \) is:

\[
\text{F: } 6.6 \times 10^{-13} \, \text{cm}
\]

ANSWER: F
