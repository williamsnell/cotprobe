Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this math problem here. Let's read it again carefully. Ken and Tami are making necklaces. Ken makes 25 necklaces. Tami makes m more necklaces than Ken. The question is asking for the expression that represents the total number of necklaces they made together.

Alright, so let's break it down. First, Ken makes 25 necklaces. That's straightforward. Now, Tami makes m more than Ken. Hmm, so if Ken made 25, then Tami must have made 25 plus m necklaces. So Tami's necklaces would be 25 + m.

Wait, so the total necklaces would be Ken's plus Tami's. So that's 25 (Ken's) plus (25 + m) (Tami's). So adding those together, it would be 25 + 25 + m. Wait, but let me check the options to see if that's one of them.

Looking at the options, option A is 25 + (25 + m). That seems correct because it's adding Ken's 25 to Tami's (25 + m). Alternatively, another way to think about it is combining the constants first. 25 + 25 is 50, so the total would be 50 + m. Hmm, that would be option I: 50 + m.

Wait, but let's make sure. So Ken is 25, Tami is 25 + m. So total is 25 + (25 + m) which is 50 + m. So both option A and I seem to be correct, but I need to see which one is presented in the options.

Looking back, option A is 25 + (25 + m), which is correct as per the structure, but option I is 50 + m, which is the simplified version. But the question asks for the expression, not the simplified version. So I think option A is the correct one because it directly represents the total as Ken's necklaces plus Tami's necklaces, which is 25 + (25 + m).

Wait, but wait again. Let me make sure I'm not making a mistake. The problem says Tami makes m more necklaces than Ken. So if Ken made 25, Tami made 25 + m. So total is 25 + (25 + m) = 50 + m. So the total is 50 + m, which is option I.

Wait, but the way the question is phrased, it's looking for the expression. So both A and I are correct, but A is the expression before simplifying, and I is the simplified version. But the question says "expression," which could accept either, but perhaps the options only include one.

Looking at the options again:

A: 25 + (25 + m)
I: 50 + m

So both are correct, but in the given options, both A and I are present. But the problem is asking for the expression, so maybe it's looking for the unsimplified version, which would be A. Or perhaps both are correct, but the way the problem is presented, I think option I is the total.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. Ken makes 25, Tami makes m more than Ken, so Tami's necklaces are 25 + m. Total is 25 + (25 + m) = 50 + m, which is option I.

Wait, but the options don't have option I as the first choice. Let me check the options again.

Wait, looking back, the options are:

A: 25 + (25 + m)
B: 25 + m
C: m + 25m
D: 25m +25
E: 25 +25m
F:25m
G:25m -m
H:2(25 +m)
I:50 +m
J:m -25

So yes, option I is 50 + m, which is the simplified version. But the question asks for the expression that represents the total number. So either A or I could be correct, depending on whether the expression is in unsimplified form or not.

Wait, the problem says "expression represents the total number of necklaces Ken and Tami made." So adding Ken's and Tami's necklaces together: Ken has 25, Tami has 25 + m. So total is 25 + (25 +m) = 50 + m. So the correct expression is 50 + m, which is option I.

Alternatively, if I thought of it as 25 + m, that would be if Tami made m necklaces in total, but the problem says m more than Ken, so it's 25 + m.

Wait, let me make sure. If Ken makes 25, and Tami makes m more than Ken, then Tami's necklaces are 25 + m. So total is 25 + (25 + m) = 50 + m. So the expression is 50 + m, which is option I.

Alternatively, if the question had said Tami makes m necklaces, then total would be 25 + m, which is option B. But that's not the case here. The problem says Tami makes m more than Ken, so it's 25 + m more than Ken's 25. So yes, total is 50 + m.

So the correct answer is option I: 50 + m.

The total number of necklaces Ken and Tami made is calculated by adding Ken's 25 necklaces to Tami's 25 + m necklaces, resulting in 50 + m.
