Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about the experiences of a sexual addict after completing a sexual act. I need to figure out the correct answer from options A to J. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I should understand what a sexual addict's behavior might look like. From what I know, sexual addiction is similar to other addictions, where the person feels compelled to engage in the behavior despite negative consequences. So, after the act, how do they typically feel?

Looking at the options:

A: Immediately starts planning the next act. That makes sense because addicts often think about their next fix. So this could be a strong contender.

B: Feels ashamed and regrets. While some might feel guilty, I'm not sure if this is the most common immediate reaction for an addict. They might feel relief but also guilt later.

C: Feels indifferent and detached. This could happen if they're emotionally detached, which is common in addictive behaviors, but does it happen right after?

D: Uses the fantasy to get aroused again. Maybe, but I'm not sure if this is the immediate experience after the act.

E: Quickly forgets and moves on. That doesn't sound right because after the act, they might feel a high, not just move on.

F: Feelings of love and connection. I don't think so; addiction often leads to isolation, so this seems unlikely.

G: Hopelessness and despair. These are more chronic feelings, maybe not the immediate post-act experience.

H: Euphoria and excitement. That sounds plausible because the act might provide a temporary high, similar to other addicts.

I: Relaxed and emotionally relieved. Maybe, but I'm not sure if that's the case for addicts.

J: Immediately aroused again and feels good. That seems possible too, as they might be seeking the next fix.

Now, I'm trying to remember what I know about addiction cycles. After the high, there's often a crash, but in the moment, they might feel euphoric. But for an addict, the next fix is often on their mind. So after the act, they might feel a temporary relief but quickly think about the next step.

Looking at the options again, A says they immediately start planning the next act. That seems to fit the addictive cycle where the person is always seeking more. So after the act, they might not feel satisfied and immediately think about the next one.

Alternatively, H suggests euphoria, which is part of the high, but the question is about their experiences after completing the act. So they might feel the high (H) but also start planning the next step (A). But the question is asking about the experiences when they've completed it, so the immediate feelings.

Wait, maybe it's A because the addict is in a cycle where each act leads to needing more, so after finishing, they start planning the next. That makes sense because they're addicted; the act doesn't bring lasting satisfaction, so they immediately seek more.

So, I think A is the correct answer because it fits the addictive behavior of continually seeking the next fix without satisfaction, leading to planning the next act right after.

The correct answer is A: (s)he immediately starts planning the next sexual act. This aligns with the addictive cycle where the individual seeks continuous gratification without lasting satisfaction, leading to immediate planning for the next act.

Answer: A
