Okay, so I've got this logic problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about determining whether a given argument is valid using indirect truth tables. If it's invalid, I need to pick the correct counterexample from the options provided.

First, let's break down the problem. The argument given is:

Premise 1: E ⊃ (F ∨ ~G)
Premise 2: F ⊃ (~E ∨ ~G)
Conclusion: ~(E ≡ F)

So, the goal is to see if the premises necessarily lead to the conclusion. If they don't, then the argument is invalid, and I need to find a counterexample where the premises are true, but the conclusion is false.

I remember that an indirect truth table involves assuming the conclusion is false and then checking if the premises can all be true under that assumption. If they can, then that's a counterexample, making the argument invalid.

The conclusion is ~(E ≡ F), which is the negation of E being equivalent to F. In other words, it's saying that E and F are not the same truth value. So, for ~(E ≡ F) to be false, E ≡ F must be true. Therefore, in the indirect truth table, I need to assume E ≡ F is true, meaning E and F have the same truth value. 

So, I'll start by creating a truth table and focusing on the cases where E and F are both true or both false.

Let's first consider when E and F are both true. Then, I'll check what that implies for G, and see if the premises hold.

Case 1: E = True, F = True.

From Premise 1: E ⊃ (F ∨ ~G). If E is true, then F ∨ ~G must be true. Since F is true, F ∨ ~G is automatically true, so Premise 1 holds.

From Premise 2: F ⊃ (~E ∨ ~G). F is true, so ~E ∨ ~G must be true. But E is true, so ~E is false. Therefore, ~G must be true for the disjunction to hold. That means G must be false.

So in this case, G is false. Let's check the conclusion: ~(E ≡ F). Since E and F are both true, E ≡ F is true, so the negation is false. Therefore, the conclusion is false, which is exactly what we're assuming in the indirect truth table. 

Wait, but in this case, both premises are true (because when E is true, Premise 1 holds, and with F true and G false, Premise 2 holds). So this is a situation where premises are true, and the conclusion is false. That means this is a counterexample, making the argument invalid.

But let me double-check. If E and F are both true, and G is false:

Premise 1: E is T, so F∨~G must be T. F is T, so yes.
Premise 2: F is T, so ~E∨~G must be T. ~E is F, but ~G is T (since G is F). So ~G is T, so the disjunction is T. So both premises are true.

Conclusion: ~(E≡F). Since E and F are both T, E≡F is T, so conclusion is F. So this is a case where premises are T, conclusion is F. Therefore, this is a counterexample.

Looking at the options, let's see which option matches this scenario. Option G says: Invalid. Counterexample when E and F are true and G is false. So that's exactly what we have here.

Wait, but other options might also be possible. Let me check another case to see if there are more counterexamples.

Case 2: E = False, F = False.

Now, E is F, so E ≡ F is T, making the conclusion ~(E≡F) false, which is what we need for the counterexample.

Check Premise 1: E is F, so E ⊃ anything is automatically T. So Premise 1 holds.

Premise 2: F is F, so F ⊃ anything is T. So Premise 2 holds.

So in this case, E and F are both F, G can be either T or F. Let's see what G would be.

Wait, but the conclusion is ~(E≡F), which is F because E and F are both F. So the conclusion is F, which is what we're looking for.

But wait, are both premises true in this case? Yes, because when E is F, any implication with E as antecedent is T. Similarly, when F is F, the implication is T regardless of the consequent.

So in this case, when E and F are both F, regardless of G's value, the premises are both true, and the conclusion is F. So this is another counterexample.

Looking at the options, which one matches this? Let me check the options again.

Option C: Invalid. Counterexample when E and G are T and F is F. Wait, no, because E and G being T wouldn't fit this case where E is F.

Option E: Invalid. Counterexample when E is F, F is T, G is F. Hmm, no, because in this case, F is F, not T.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me see. So the two cases where E and F are equal (both T or both F) are possible counterexamples. So in the first case, E=T, F=T, G=F is a counterexample. In the second case, E=F, F=F, G can be anything.

But looking at the options, perhaps only one of these is listed. Let me check each option.

Option A: Invalid. Counterexample when E is T, F is F, G is T.

Wait, in this case, E and F are not equal (E=T, F=F), so E≡F is F, so ~ (E≡F) is T, which would make the conclusion T. So the conclusion is not F in this case, so this doesn't work as a counterexample because the conclusion is T, not F.

So option A is not a counterexample.

Option B: Valid. But we've already found a counterexample, so B is incorrect.

Option C: Invalid. Counterexample when E and G are T and F is F.

Wait, E=T, G=T, F=F.

In this case, E and F are not equal (E=T, F=F), so E≡F is F, so ~ (E≡F) is T. So the conclusion is T, which doesn't make it a counterexample because we need the conclusion to be F. So option C is not a counterexample.

Option D: Valid. No counterexample found. But we've found counterexamples, so D is incorrect.

Option E: Invalid. Counterexample when E is F, F is T, G is F.

In this case, E=F, F=T. So E and F are not equal (E=F, F=T), so E≡F is F, so ~ (E≡F) is T. So the conclusion is T, which doesn't make it a counterexample. So E is incorrect.

Option F: Invalid. Counterexample when F and G are T and E is F.

E=F, F=T, G=T.

So E and F are not equal, so E≡F is F, so ~ (E≡F) is T. So conclusion is T, which doesn't work as a counterexample. So F is incorrect.

Option G: Invalid. Counterexample when E and F are T and G is F.

Yes, this matches our first case: E=T, F=T, G=F. In this scenario, both premises are true, and the conclusion is F. So this is a valid counterexample.

Therefore, the correct answer is option G.
</think>

The argument is invalid because we found a counterexample where the premises are true, and the conclusion is false. Specifically, when E and F are true, and G is false, both premises hold, but the conclusion ~(E ≡ F) is false. 

Answer: G
