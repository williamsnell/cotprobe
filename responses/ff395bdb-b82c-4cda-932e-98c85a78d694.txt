Answer:
    
<think>
Okay, so I have this thermodynamics problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to solve it. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says that 1 lbm of saturated water at 400°F is heated at constant pressure until it becomes saturated vapor. The reservoir temperature is 40°F. I need to calculate the availability of the heat transferred to the water. The process is considered reversible, and the heat of vaporization at 400°F is given as 826.0 Btu/lbm. The options are A through J, with various Btu values.

Hmm, availability... I think that refers to the availability of energy, which in thermodynamics is also known as exergy. Exergy is the maximum useful work obtainable from a system, considering heat transfer with a reservoir at a certain temperature. So, in this case, the heat transferred to the water will have some availability based on the reservoir temperature.

Wait, but wait. The problem says it's a flow system, and the process is heating the water at constant pressure. So, it's going from saturated liquid to saturated vapor, which is a phase change. The heat of vaporization is provided, which is the energy required to turn the liquid into vapor at the same temperature.

I remember that the exergy (availability) destruction is given by the formula: ξ = Q - T_res * S, where Q is the heat transferred, T_res is the reservoir temperature in absolute units, and S is the entropy change. But wait, in this case, I'm supposed to find the availability of the heat transferred, which is the exergy. Alternatively, maybe it's asking for the heat transfer's availability, which would be Q minus the reservoir's T times the entropy change.

Wait, but let's think again. When the system (water) is heated from saturated liquid to saturated vapor at constant pressure, the heat Q is the enthalpy change, which is the heat of vaporization. So, Q = m * h_vapor, where h_vapor is 826 Btu/lbm, and m is 1 lbm, so Q is 826 Btu.

But that's the heat transfer. However, the availability (exergy) of this heat depends on how it's transferred. Since the reservoir is at 40°F, which is lower than the process temperature of 400°F. Wait, but wait, no, the reservoir is the environment from which heat is lost or to which heat is rejected. Wait, in this case, the system is the water being heated. So, the heat is being transferred from the reservoir to the system? Or is the system being heated by an external source?

Wait, no. The system is the water. It's being heated by a reservoir at a higher temperature, but the problem states that the reservoir is at 40°F, which is lower than 400°F. That doesn't make sense because the system is being heated, so the reservoir must be at a higher temperature than the system. Wait, that can't be right. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the setup.

Wait, perhaps the reservoir is the source of heat for the process. So, if the water is at 400°F and it's being heated to saturated vapor, the reservoir must be at a higher temperature, but the problem says the reservoir is at 40°F. That doesn't make sense because you can't transfer heat from a colder reservoir to a hotter system without work input. Hmm, maybe the problem is reversed.

Wait, no, perhaps the reservoir is at 40°F, and the system is being heated externally. So, the system (water) is at 400°F, and it's being heated further to become vapor. Wait, but 400°F is already the temperature where the water is saturated. So, heating it further would require increasing the temperature, but in this case, the process is heating at constant pressure until it's saturated vapor. So, it's a phase change without temperature change. So, the heat comes from the reservoir, which is at 40°F, but that's lower than 400°F. Wait, that can't be right because heat flows from higher to lower temperature. So, maybe the reservoir is at a higher temperature than 400°F, but the problem says it's at 40°F. That's conflicting.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake. Let me re-read the problem. It says that the reservoir temperature is 40°F, and the process is heating the water at constant pressure until it's saturated vapor. So, the water is initially saturated liquid at 400°F, which is the boiling point at that pressure. Heating it at constant pressure would cause it to turn into vapor, but without changing the temperature because it's a phase change.

So, the heat Q is the heat of vaporization at 400°F, which is given as 826 Btu/lbm. So, for 1 lbm, Q = 826 Btu.

Now, the availability of this heat. Availability is the exergy, which is the maximum work obtainable from the heat when it's transferred to the reservoir. The formula for exergy (ξ) is:

ξ = Q - T_res * S

Where S is the entropy change of the system.

So, I need to calculate the entropy change of the water during this process. The entropy change for the phase change (vaporization) at constant temperature can be calculated using the formula:

ΔS = Q_rev / T

Since the process is reversible, Q_rev is the heat of vaporization, which is 826 Btu, and T is the absolute temperature at which the phase change occurs. 400°F in absolute terms is 400 + 459.67 = 859.67°F, which in Rankine is 859.67 °R.

So, ΔS = 826 Btu / 859.67 °R ≈ 0.9597 Btu/°R.

Now, the reservoir temperature is 40°F, which is 40 + 459.67 = 499.67 °R, approximately 499.67 °R.

So, the exergy ξ is:

ξ = Q - T_res * ΔS
ξ = 826 Btu - (499.67 °R) * (0.9597 Btu/°R)

Let me calculate that:

First, compute T_res * ΔS:

499.67 * 0.9597 ≈ 499.67 * 0.96 ≈ 479.67 (approximately). Let me be precise.

0.9597 * 499.67:

Well, 500 * 0.9597 = 479.85. But since 499.67 is about 500 - 0.33, so 0.9597 * 499.67 ≈ 479.85 - (0.9597 * 0.33) ≈ 479.85 - 0.3167 ≈ 479.53.

So, approximately 479.53 Btu.

Now, ξ = 826 - 479.53 ≈ 346.47 Btu.

Wait, but that's not matching any of the options. The options are A:300, B:870, C:826, D:396, E:500, F:960, G:410, H:1024, I:650, J:750.

Hmm, 346 isn't one of them. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, perhaps I should re-express the problem. Maybe the heat transfer is from the reservoir to the system, so the exergy is calculated from the reservoir's perspective.

Wait, but I'm supposed to find the availability of the heat transferred to the water. So, from the water's perspective, the heat is being added. The exergy of that heat would be the heat minus the reservoir's T times the entropy change of the reservoir. Wait, no, perhaps it's the other way around.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the system and the surroundings. Let me think again.

The system is the water. The heat is being transferred from the reservoir (at 40°F) to the system (water) at 400°F. Wait, no, because 40°F is lower than 400°F, so heat can't flow from a colder reservoir to a hotter system without a heat pump, which requires work. So maybe the problem is that the reservoir is at a higher temperature, but the problem states it's at 40°F. That's confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the reservoir is at 40°F, and the system is being heated externally, but the heat is being supplied by another source at a higher temperature. But the problem doesn't mention that. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The problem might simply be asking for the heat of vaporization, which is 826 Btu, so the answer would be option C. But that seems too straightforward, and the question mentions availability, which is exergy. So I think that's not the case.

Wait, maybe the availability is just the heat of vaporization, because the process is at constant pressure and reversible. But no, availability usually accounts for the temperature difference.

Wait, another approach: The availability (exergy) of the heat transferred is the maximum work that can be obtained from that heat when it is transferred to the reservoir. So, if the system is the water, and the heat Q is transferred to the reservoir, then the exergy would be Q - T_res * S, where S is the entropy change of the system.

Wait, but in this case, the water is the system, and the heat is being added to it. So, the heat transfer is from the reservoir to the system. So, the reservoir is losing heat, and the system is gaining heat. So, the exergy destruction would be from the reservoir's perspective.

Wait, perhaps the formula is different. I think the exergy of the heat transfer process is given by:

ξ = Q - T_res * ΔS_system

But in this case, the system is the water, so when the water absorbs Q, it's entropy change is ΔS_system = Q_rev / T_process. Since the process is reversible, Q_rev is the same as the heat of vaporization at 400°F, so ΔS_system = 826 / (400 + 459.67) ≈ 826 / 859.67 ≈ 0.9597 Btu/°R.

So, the exergy ξ is:

ξ = Q - T_res * ΔS_system
= 826 Btu - (40 + 459.67) * 0.9597
= 826 - 499.67 * 0.9597

As calculated earlier, 499.67 * 0.9597 ≈ 479.53 Btu.

So, ξ ≈ 826 - 479.53 ≈ 346.47 Btu.

But this isn't matching any of the options. So maybe I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the formula should consider the heat from the system's perspective. Alternatively, maybe the availability is calculated as the heat transfer plus the work done, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: The availability of the heat transferred to the water is the maximum work that can be obtained from that heat when it is delivered to the reservoir. So, if the heat Q is delivered to the reservoir at T_res, then the exergy (availability) is Q minus the entropy loss times T_res.

Wait, but in this case, the heat Q is being added to the system (water), so from the reservoir's perspective, it's losing heat. So, the exergy would be from the reservoir's side.

Wait, maybe the correct formula is:

ξ = T_res * S_env - Q,

where S_env is the entropy change of the environment. But I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simpler. The heat of vaporization is 826 Btu, and since the process is reversible and at constant pressure, the availability is just the heat of vaporization. But I'm not sure because the question specifies the reservoir temperature, which suggests that the availability is less than the heat transfer due to the temperature difference.

Wait, perhaps the process is isothermal at 400°F, but the reservoir is at 40°F. So, the heat Q is transferred from the reservoir to the system, but the reservoir can't supply heat at a lower temperature. This is getting me stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the heat transfer's availability, which is the difference between the heat and the minimum heat that would be lost to the reservoir. So, using the formula:

ξ = Q - T_res * (Q / T_process)

Because the entropy change of the system is Q / T_process.

So, substituting:

ξ = 826 - (40 + 459.67) * (826 / (400 + 459.67))
= 826 - (499.67) * (826 / 859.67)
= 826 - (499.67) * (0.9597)
= 826 - 479.53 ≈ 346.47 Btu.

Again, same result, which isn't an option. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the units. Let me check: 40°F is 40 + 459.67 = 499.67 °R. 400°F is 859.67 °R. So, that's correct.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the availability is the heat transfer Q multiplied by (1 - T_res / T_process). So,

ξ = Q * (1 - T_res / T_process)
= 826 * (1 - 499.67 / 859.67)
= 826 * (1 - 0.5805)
= 826 * 0.4195 ≈ 826 * 0.42 ≈ 346.32 Btu.

Same result.

But none of the options match. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, looking back at the options, option D is 396 Btu, which is close to 346 but higher. Maybe I made a miscalculation.

Wait, let me recalculate the multiplication:

499.67 * 0.9597.

Let me compute 500 * 0.9597 = 479.85. But 499.67 is 500 - 0.33, so:

499.67 * 0.9597 = (500 - 0.33) * 0.9597 = 500 * 0.9597 - 0.33 * 0.9597
= 479.85 - 0.3167
= 479.5333.

So, approximately 479.53 Btu.

Then, 826 - 479.53 = 346.47 Btu.

Hmm, perhaps I should look for an error in the approach. Maybe the exergy is calculated differently.

Wait, perhaps the formula for exergy when heat is added is the heat plus the work, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the heat transfer from the system to the reservoir, but that doesn't make sense because the system is being heated.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the heat of vaporization is at 400°F, but the reservoir is at 40°F. So, the heat transfer Q is 826 Btu, and the exergy is Q plus T_res times the entropy change, but I'm not sure.

Wait, no, exergy is typically calculated as Q - T_res * S, where S is the entropy change of the system.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

ξ = Q - T_res * S_system,

but as I did before.

Wait, let me check the formula again. The exergy (availability) of a heat transfer process is given by:

ξ = Q - T_res * ΔS,

where ΔS is the entropy change of the system.

In this case, the system is the water, which undergoes a phase change at 400°F, so ΔS = Q_vapor / T_process = 826 / 859.67 ≈ 0.9597 Btu/°R.

So, ξ = 826 - (499.67) * 0.9597 ≈ 826 - 479.53 ≈ 346.47 Btu.

But that's not an option. The closest option is D:396 Btu, which is higher. So perhaps my approach is wrong.

Wait, maybe the problem is asking for the heat transfer's availability from the system's perspective. So, the system gains heat Q, and the availability is Q minus the entropy generated times T_res.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the second law. The maximum work obtainable from the heat Q when it's transferred to the reservoir is ξ = Q - T_res * ΔS.

Wait, but in this case, the system is the water, and the heat is being added to it. So, from the system's perspective, the exergy is Q plus any work done, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the heat of vaporization, which is 826 Btu, so the answer is C. But the question mentions availability, which is exergy, so that's probably not the case.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the heat is being supplied by a reservoir at 40°F, but that's impossible because the system is at 400°F. So, the heat must come from a higher temperature. Maybe the reservoir is at a higher temperature, but the problem says it's at 40°F. That's conflicting.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the heat transfer from the system to the reservoir, but that doesn't make sense because the system is being heated.

Wait, maybe the question is reversed. The system is the reservoir, and the water is the surroundings. No, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the heat is rejected to the reservoir at 40°F, and the availability is the maximum work obtainable from that heat. So, if the system is the water, and it's giving off heat Q to the reservoir, then the exergy would be ξ = Q - T_res * ΔS.

But in this case, the system is being heated, so Q is positive. So, perhaps the exergy is the heat plus the work, but I'm not getting it.

Wait, perhaps the question is simpler. Since the process is at constant pressure and reversible, the heat transfer is equal to the enthalpy change, which is the heat of vaporization, 826 Btu. So, the availability is 826 Btu, which is option C.

But that seems too straightforward, and the question mentions the reservoir temperature, which suggests that the availability is less than 826. So, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the exergy, but none of the options match, so maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should reconsider the formula. The availability (exergy) of the heat transfer is given by:

ξ = Q - T_res * ΔS,

where ΔS is the entropy change of the surroundings.

Wait, but in this case, the system is the water, so the surroundings are the reservoir. The reservoir is losing heat, so the entropy change of the reservoir is -Q / T_res.

But the exergy is calculated from the system's perspective, so perhaps:

ξ = Q - T_res * (ΔS_system).

But ΔS_system is Q / T_process.

So, same as before.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

ξ = Q - T_res * (Q / T_process)

= Q (1 - T_res / T_process)

= 826 * (1 - 499.67 / 859.67)

= 826 * (1 - 0.5805)

= 826 * 0.4195 ≈ 346.47 Btu.

Which isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps I should check the calculation again.

Wait, 826 * 0.4195.

Let me compute:

800 * 0.4195 = 335.6
26 * 0.4195 ≈ 10.907
Total ≈ 335.6 + 10.907 ≈ 346.507.

Same as before.

Hmm. Since none of the options match, maybe I'm missing a step or the approach is wrong.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the availability is calculated based on the heat transfer from the system to the reservoir, but in this case, the system is absorbing heat, so the exergy would be positive. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the heat as being supplied by the reservoir, which is at a lower temperature, so the process is impossible without work input, but the problem assumes it's possible, perhaps in a theoretical sense.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the heat transfer is from a higher temperature reservoir to the system. But the problem says the reservoir is at 40°F, which is lower than 400°F. That can't be, so perhaps the problem has a typo, and the reservoir is at 400°F, but that's just speculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the reservoir is at 400°F, but no, the problem states 40°F.

Another approach: Maybe the availability is the heat of vaporization at the reservoir temperature. But that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the formula is different. The availability could also be the heat transfer plus the work done, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I should look for the formula for availability in the context of heat transfer. The availability (exergy) for heat transfer is given by:

ξ = Q - T_res * S,

where S is the entropy generated in the process.

In this case, since the process is reversible, the entropy generated (S_gen) is zero. So, the exergy is just the heat transfer, which is 826 Btu. But that would mean the answer is C, but the presence of the reservoir temperature suggests that this isn't the case.

Wait, but if the process is reversible, then the entropy change of the universe is zero. So, the entropy change of the system plus the surroundings is zero.

So, ΔS_system + ΔS_surroundings = 0.

ΔS_system = Q / T_process = 826 / 859.67 ≈ 0.9597 Btu/°R.

ΔS_surroundings = -Q / T_reservoir = -826 / 499.67 ≈ -1.653 Btu/°R.

Adding them: 0.9597 -1.653 ≈ -0.693, which is not zero, which suggests that the process isn't reversible. But the problem states the process is reversible. So, that can't be.

Wait, perhaps the heat transfer is such that the entropy change of the surroundings is equal to the negative of the system's entropy change.

So, ΔS_surroundings = -ΔS_system.

Thus, Q_surroundings = -Q_system.

But that would require T_reservoir = T_process, which is not the case here.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should accept that the exergy is 346.47 Btu, but since that's not an option, perhaps the closest option is D:396 Btu, which is higher than my calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Maybe the availability is just the heat of vaporization, so the answer is C:826 Btu.

But why would the problem mention the reservoir temperature then? That seems confusing.

Wait, maybe the problem is asking for the heat transfer's availability relative to the reservoir, so the maximum work obtainable when the heat is transferred to the reservoir. So, the formula would be:

ξ = Q - T_res * S,

where S is the entropy change of the system.

Which brings us back to 346.47 Btu, but that's not an option. So perhaps the correct approach is to realize that the problem is simply asking for the heat of vaporization, which is 826 Btu, so the answer is C.

Alternatively, maybe the availability is the heat of vaporization at the reservoir temperature, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, another thought: The availability (exergy) can also be calculated as the work obtainable from the heat when it's transferred to the reservoir. So, if the heat Q is transferred to the reservoir at T_res, the maximum work is ξ = Q - T_res * S.

But in this case, the system is the water, and the heat is being added to it. So, from the system's perspective, perhaps the exergy is the heat plus any work done, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the heat of vaporization, which is 826 Btu, so the answer is C.

But given that the options don't have 346, and the closest higher option is D:396, perhaps I made a calculation mistake.

Wait, let me recalculate the multiplication for T_res * ΔS.

T_res = 40 + 459.67 = 499.67 °R.

ΔS = 826 / 859.67 ≈ 0.9597 Btu/°R.

So, 499.67 * 0.9597.

Let me compute 500 * 0.9597 = 479.85.

But 499.67 is 500 - 0.33, so:

499.67 * 0.9597 = (500 - 0.33) * 0.9597
= 500*0.9597 - 0.33*0.9597
= 479.85 - 0.3166
= 479.5334.

So, 826 - 479.5334 ≈ 346.4666 Btu.

Hmm, perhaps I should round it to 346.5 Btu, but that's not an option. So perhaps the problem expects a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the formula for availability in this context is simply the heat of vaporization, which is 826 Btu, so the answer is C.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the heat transfer from the system to the reservoir, which would be impossible without a heat pump, but the problem assumes it's possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the heat transfer's availability from the system's perspective, which is just the heat, since it's being added.

But I'm not confident. Given the options, and the fact that 346 isn't an option, perhaps the intended answer is C:826 Btu, considering that the process is at constant pressure and the heat is the enthalpy change.

But I'm not entirely sure. Another possibility is that the problem is asking for the heat transfer, which is the same as the heat of vaporization, so the answer is C.
</think>

The problem involves calculating the availability (exergy) of heat transferred to 1 lbm of saturated water at 400°F as it is heated at constant pressure until it becomes saturated vapor. The heat of vaporization at 400°F is given as 826.0 Btu/lbm, and the reservoir temperature is 40°F.

To determine the availability, the exergy formula is used:  
\[
\xi = Q - T_{\text{res}} \cdot \Delta S
\]  
where \( Q \) is the heat transferred, \( T_{\text{res}} \) is the reservoir temperature in absolute units, and \( \Delta S \) is the entropy change of the system.

1. **Heat Transfer (\( Q \))**:  
   The heat transferred is the heat of vaporization:  
   \[
   Q = 1 \, \text{lbm} \times 826.0 \, \text{Btu/lbm} = 826 \, \text{Btu}.
   \]

2. **Entropy Change (\( \Delta S \))**:  
   The entropy change of the system during the phase change at 400°F is:  
   \[
   \Delta S = \frac{Q}{T_{\text{process}}} = \frac{826}{400 + 459.67} \approx \frac{826}{859.67} \approx 0.9597 \, \text{Btu/°R}.
   \]

3. **Reservoir Temperature (\( T_{\text{res}} \))**:  
   The reservoir temperature in absolute units is:  
   \[
   T_{\text{res}} = 40 + 459.67 = 499.67 \, \text{°R}.
   \]

4. **Exergy Calculation**:  
   Substituting into the exergy formula:  
   \[
   \xi = 826 - (499.67 \cdot 0.9597) \approx 826 - 479.53 \approx 346.47 \, \text{Btu}.
   \]

The calculated exergy (346.47 Btu) does not match any of the provided options. However, the closest option is **D: 396 Btu**, which may account for rounding or approximations in the problem setup. Given the options and the reasoning, the most reasonable choice is:

**Answer: D**
