Okay, so I need to figure out the three dimensions of intimacy in romantic relationships that outline closeness and sharing. Hmm, I remember from psychology class that intimacy has different components. Let me think about what those might be.

I think intimacy involves emotional closeness, so that's one dimension. Then there's the physical aspect, like touch and sex, which is another part. Oh wait, I also remember that trust is a big part of it because without trust, you can't really share deeply. Or maybe it's not just trust, but mutual self-disclosure, where both partners share personal things about themselves.

Looking at the options, option A is mutual self-disclosure, sexuality, and trusting. That seems to cover emotional sharing (mutual self-disclosure), physical (sexuality), and trust. Option C is affective, emotional, and sexual. Affective refers to emotions, so that's similar to emotional. Option D is emotional, caring, and trustful. That's emotional closeness, caring, and trust. Option G is trust, caring, and sexuality. Hmm.

Wait, I think the key dimensions are emotional, physical, and cognitive or maybe affective. I'm a bit confused. Oh, I remember reading about intimacy being composed of emotional, physical, and cognitive dimensions, but I'm not sure. Or is it affective, which is about feelings, so affective, physical, and cognitive? That would be option H.

Alternatively, I think another model breaks intimacy into emotional, physical, and cognitive. But I'm not certain. Let me think again. The question mentions closeness and sharing, so emotional closeness is definitely one. Physical closeness, like being intimate in a physical way, is another. Then, maybe trust or mutual self-disclosure as the third.

Looking at the options, option A has mutual self-disclosure, which is about sharing, so that's emotional. Sexuality covers the physical, and trusting is about the cognitive or trust aspect. So A might be correct. But I'm not sure because I thought it's sometimes broken down into emotional, physical, and cognitive.

Wait, another thought: intimacy can be divided into three parts: emotional (sharing feelings), physical (touch, sex), and cognitive (intellectual connection, communication). If that's the case, then the answer would be H: affective, cognitive, and physical. Because affective relates to emotions, cognitive to thoughts, and physical to touch.

But I'm still a bit confused because sometimes the dimensions are emotional, physical, and trust. Or maybe mutual self-disclosure, trust, and sexuality. I think I need to recall the specific model. Oh, right! I remember that the three dimensions of intimacy are emotional, physical, and cognitive. So affective (emotional), cognitive, and physical. That's option H.

Wait, no, I'm mixing up terms. Affective is about emotions, so maybe the dimensions are affective, physical, and cognitive. So H is correct. But I'm not 100% certain. Alternatively, I've heard of emotional, physical, and sexual as the three dimensions. So that would be option C: affective (emotional), sexual (physical), but wait, option C is affective, emotional, and sexual, which seems redundant because affective is emotional. Maybe that's not right.

Alternatively, the three dimensions are emotional closeness, physical closeness, and cognitive closeness. So that would be H: affective (emotional), cognitive, and physical. So I'm leaning toward H.
