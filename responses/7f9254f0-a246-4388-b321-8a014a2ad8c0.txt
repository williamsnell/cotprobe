Okay, so I've got this airplane problem to solve. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll do my best.

The problem gives me the weight of the airplane as 3000 pounds-force (lbf). Its wing area is 300 square feet, and the takeoff speed is 100 feet per second. The lift and drag coefficients are given as functions of the angle of attack, alpha. The atmospheric density is 0.00238 slugs per cubic foot.

The goal is to find the angle of attack that ensures takeoff at the desired speed and the power required for takeoff. Then, I need to choose the correct option from A to J.

First, I think about the basics. For an airplane to take off, the lift must equal the weight at the given speed. So, lift (L) is equal to weight (W). The formula for lift is L = 0.5 * rho * v^2 * A * C_L. Similarly, drag (D) is calculated using the same formula but with C_D for drag.

Since we're dealing with takeoff, the power required is the product of the thrust needed and the speed. But wait, power is usually force times velocity, so P = T * v, where T is thrust. However, another approach is to consider that the power required is the rate at which work is done against the drag force. So, maybe P = D * v.

But let me make sure. The power required should be the product of the drag force and the ground speed because the engine is working against the drag to maintain or accelerate the airplane to takeoff speed.

So, step by step:

1. Set lift equal to weight to find the angle of attack, alpha.
2. Use the given C_L equation to express lift in terms of alpha.
3. Solve for alpha where L = W.
4. Once alpha is found, calculate the drag coefficient C_D using the given formula.
5. Compute the drag force D.
6. Calculate the power required as P = D * v.

Let me write down the equations.

Lift equation: L = 0.5 * rho * v^2 * A * C_L
Weight: W = 3000 lbf
C_L = 0.35 (1 + 0.2 alpha)
v = 100 ft/s
A = 300 ft²
rho = 0.00238 slug/ft³

So, setting L = W:

0.5 * rho * v² * A * C_L = W

Plugging in the numbers:

0.5 * 0.00238 * (100)^2 * 300 * [0.35 (1 + 0.2 alpha)] = 3000

Let me compute each part step by step.

First, calculate 0.5 * rho: 0.5 * 0.00238 = 0.00119

Next, v squared: 100^2 = 10,000

Multiply that by A: 10,000 * 300 = 3,000,000

Now, multiply by the term with C_L: 3,000,000 * 0.35 (1 + 0.2 alpha)

So, 3,000,000 * 0.35 = 1,050,000. So the equation becomes:

0.00119 * 1,050,000 * (1 + 0.2 alpha) = 3000

Wait, no, wait. Let me re-express:

Wait, the initial equation after substitution is:

0.5 * rho * v² * A * 0.35 (1 + 0.2 alpha) = W

So, 0.5 * 0.00238 * (100)^2 * 300 * 0.35 (1 + 0.2 alpha) = 3000

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute the entire left side without substitution first.

Let me compute the constants first.

Compute 0.5 * rho * v² * A * 0.35:

0.5 * 0.00238 = 0.00119
v² = 10,000
A = 300
0.35 is a constant factor.

So, 0.00119 * 10,000 = 11.9
11.9 * 300 = 3570
3570 * 0.35 ≈ 1250.

Wait, wait, that can't be right. Let me compute each multiplication step by step.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me compute the entire left side expression.

L = 0.5 * rho * v² * A * C_L

We can compute this as:

0.5 * rho = 0.5 * 0.00238 = 0.00119

Then, v² = 100^2 = 10,000.

So, 0.00119 * 10,000 = 11.9

Multiply by A: 11.9 * 300 = 3570

Multiply by C_L: 3570 * 0.35 (1 + 0.2 alpha) = 3570 * 0.35 * (1 + 0.2 alpha)

Wait, 3570 * 0.35 = let's compute that.

3570 * 0.35: 3570 * 0.3 = 1071, 3570 * 0.05 = 178.5. So total is 1071 + 178.5 = 1249.5.

So, L = 1249.5 * (1 + 0.2 alpha) = W = 3000 lbf.

So:

1249.5 * (1 + 0.2 alpha) = 3000

Divide both sides by 1249.5:

1 + 0.2 alpha = 3000 / 1249.5 ≈ ?

Let me calculate 3000 / 1249.5.

Dividing 3000 by 1249.5:

1249.5 * 2 = 2499, which is less than 3000. 3000 -2499 = 501.

So 2 + (501/1249.5). Let's compute 501/1249.5 ≈ 0.4013.

So, approximately 2.4013.

So, 1 + 0.2 alpha ≈ 2.4013

Subtract 1: 0.2 alpha ≈ 1.4013

So, alpha ≈ 1.4013 / 0.2 = 7.0065 degrees.

Hmm, that's about 7 degrees. Let me double-check the calculations to make sure.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations. Let me do it again.

Compute 0.5 * rho = 0.5 * 0.00238 = 0.00119.

v² = 100^2 = 10,000.

So, 0.00119 * 10,000 = 11.9.

Multiply by A (300): 11.9 * 300 = 3570.

Multiply by C_L: 3570 * 0.35 = 1249.5.

So, L = 1249.5 * (1 + 0.2 alpha) = 3000.

So, 1 + 0.2 alpha = 3000 / 1249.5 ≈ 2.4013.

So, 0.2 alpha = 1.4013 → alpha ≈ 7.0065 degrees. So, approximately 7 degrees.

Looking at the options, E is 7 degrees, 41.5 hp.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculation. Maybe I should compute 3000 / 1249.5 more accurately.

3000 ÷ 1249.5:

Let me compute 1249.5 * 2.4 = ?

1249.5 * 2 = 2499.

1249.5 * 0.4 = 499.8.

So, 2499 + 499.8 = 2998.8. That's very close to 3000.

So, 2.4 gives us 2998.8, which is just 1.2 less than 3000.

So, 1249.5 * 2.4013 = 3000.

So, 1 + 0.2 alpha = 2.4013 → 0.2 alpha = 1.4013 → alpha = 7.0065 degrees.

So, about 7 degrees. So the angle of attack is 7 degrees. That matches option E, which is 7 degrees, 41.5 hp.

Now, compute the power required.

First, calculate the drag force D at alpha = 7 degrees.

C_D = 0.008 (1 + alpha). Since alpha is in degrees, we just plug in 7.

C_D = 0.008 * (1 +7) = 0.008 *8=0.064.

Then, drag force D = 0.5 * rho * v² * A * C_D.

Compute D:

0.5 * rho = 0.00119.

v² = 10,000.

A=300.

C_D=0.064.

So, D = 0.00119 * 10,000 * 300 * 0.064.

Compute step by step:

0.00119 *10,000 = 11.9.

11.9 *300 = 3570.

3570 *0.064.

Compute 3570 * 0.06 = 214.2.

3570 * 0.004 = 14.28.

Total D = 214.2 +14.28 = 228.48 lbf.

Power P = D * v.

v = 100 ft/s.

So P = 228.48 *100 = 22,848 ft-lbf/s, which is horsepower (hp), since 1 hp ≈ 550 ft-lbf/s.

So, P ≈ 22,848 / 550 ≈ let's compute that.

550 *41 = 22,550.

22,848 -22,550 = 298.

298 /550 ≈ 0.542.

So total P ≈41.542 hp. Approximately 41.5 hp.

So the angle is 7 degrees, power is 41.5 hp, which matches option E: 7 degrees, 41.5 hp.

Wait, but let me double-check the C_D calculation.

C_D = 0.008*(1 + alpha). Alpha is 7 degrees, so 1+7=8. 0.008*8=0.064. Correct.

Then, D = 0.5 * rho * v² * A * C_D.

Wait, 0.5*rho =0.00119.

v²=10,000.

A=300.

0.00119 *10,000 =11.9.

11.9 *300=3570.

3570 *0.064= ?

Let me compute 3570 *0.06 =214.2.

3570 *0.004=14.28.

Total D= 214.2 +14.28=228.48 lbf. Correct.

Power P =228.48 *100=22,848 ft-lbf/s.

Convert to hp: 22,848 /550 ≈41.54, which rounds to 41.5 hp.

So the answer should be E:7 degrees,41.5 hp.

To determine the angle of attack and power required for takeoff, we start by equating lift to weight. The lift equation is:

\[
L = 0.5 \cdot \rho \cdot v^2 \cdot A \cdot C_L
\]

Given:
- \( W = 3000 \, \text{lbf} \)
- \( \rho = 0.00238 \, \text{slug/ft}^3 \)
- \( v = 100 \, \text{ft/s} \)
- \( A = 300 \, \text{ft}^2 \)
- \( C_L = 0.35(1 + 0.2\alpha) \)

Setting \( L = W \):

\[
0.5 \cdot 0.00238 \cdot 100^2 \cdot 300 \cdot 0.35(1 + 0.2\alpha) = 3000
\]

Simplify constants:

\[
0.5 \cdot 0.00238 = 0.00119, \quad 100^2 = 10,000, \quad 0.00119 \cdot 10,000 = 11.9, \quad 11.9 \cdot 300 = 3570
\]

\[
3570 \cdot 0.35 = 1249.5
\]

\[
1249.5 \cdot (1 + 0.2\alpha) = 3000
\]

\[
1 + 0.2\alpha = \frac{3000}{1249.5} \approx 2.4013
\]

\[
0.2\alpha = 1.4013 \implies \alpha \approx 7.0065^\circ
\]

Thus, the angle of attack is approximately \( 7^\circ \).

Next, calculate the power required. The drag coefficient is:

\[
C_D = 0.008(1 + \alpha) = 0.008(1 + 7) = 0.064
\]

Drag force \( D \):

\[
D = 0.5 \cdot \rho \cdot v^2 \cdot A \cdot C_D
\]

\[
D = 0.00119 \cdot 10,000 \cdot 300 \cdot 0.064 = 228.48 \, \text{lbf}
\]

Power required \( P \):

\[
P = D \cdot v = 228.48 \cdot 100 = 22,848 \, \text{ft-lbf/s}
\]

Convert to horsepower (\( 1 \, \text{hp} = 550 \, \text{ft-lbf/s} \)):

\[
P = \frac{22,848}{550} \approx 41.5 \, \text{hp}
\]

Thus, the angle of attack is \( 7^\circ \), and the power required is \( 41.5 \, \text{hp} \), matching option E.
