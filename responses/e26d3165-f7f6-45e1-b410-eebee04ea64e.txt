Alright, so I'm trying to figure out the definition of overweight based on the given options. I remember that BMI stands for Body Mass Index, which is a common way to categorize weight status. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact ranges, so I'll need to think this through carefully.

First, I know that BMI is calculated by dividing a person's weight in kilograms by the square of their height in meters. The categories are usually based on these BMI values. From what I recall, the categories are underweight, normal weight, overweight, and obese.

I think the normal weight range is around 18.5 to 24.9 BMI. Then overweight is above that but not yet obese. I'm pretty sure that the cutoff for obesity is a BMI of 30 or higher. So that would mean overweight is somewhere between 25 and just below 30.

Looking at the options, let me go through them one by one. Option A is 22-26, which seems too low because I think normal weight goes up to about 24.9. So 26 might be into the overweight category. Option B is 23-27, which also might be overlapping with normal and overweight. Option C is 25-30, which sounds right because that's just above the normal range and under 30, which is the start of obesity. Option D is BMI over 30, which I believe is the definition of obesity, not overweight. Option E is 24-28, which also seems plausible because 24 is the upper limit of normal, so 24.1 and above would be overweight up to 28. But I'm not sure if it's up to 28 or 30.

Option F is 26-30. That starts at 26, which is within the overweight range, but ends at 30, which is the start of obesity. So that might not be the correct definition because it includes some obesity. Option G is 25-29.9, which fits because 25 is the start of overweight and 29.9 is just below 30, which is obesity. Option H is over 25, which would include both overweight and obesity, so that's too broad. Option I is 20-25, which is the normal weight range, so that's not it. Option J is exactly 25, which is a single value, not a range.

So putting it all together, the overweight category should be from 25 up to but not including 30. Looking at the options, option G is 25-29.9, which matches that. Option C is 25-30, which technically includes 30, which is incorrect because 30 is obesity. Therefore, the correct answer should be option G.

The definition of overweight is a BMI range starting from 25 up to, but not including, 30 kg/m². Among the options provided, option G (BMI 25-29.9 kg/m²) correctly represents this range. 

Answer: G
