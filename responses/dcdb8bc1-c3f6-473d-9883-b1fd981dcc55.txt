Okay, so I'm trying to solve this production method question for Sigma Corporation. Let me read through the problem again to make sure I understand it.

Sigma is looking at different production methods (alpha to epsilon) that can produce 10 dozen pairs of shoes per day. Each method has a specific number of workers and machines. The production function given is S = sqrt(W * M), where S is the number of shoes produced, W is the number of workers, and M is the number of machines. 

The goal is to find which production method is technically efficient, meaning it's using the least inputs to produce the same output. Since all methods are supposed to produce 10 dozen shoes, I need to see which method uses the fewest total inputs (workers + machines) or perhaps the least cost if that's considered, but since the question doesn't mention costs, I think it's just about minimizing inputs.

Looking at the data:

- Alpha: 30 workers, 10 machines
- Beta: 25 workers, 7 machines
- Gamma: 22 workers, 5 machines
- Delta: 20 workers, 6 machines
- Epsilon: 20 workers, 5 machines

Wait, no, the table seems to have the first column as the production method and the next two columns as workers and machines. So:

Production Method | Workers | Machines
-----------------|---------|----------
Alpha            | 30      | 10
Beta             | 25      | 7
Gamma            | 22      | 5
Delta            | 20      | 6
Epsilon          | 20      | 5

Wait, no, looking back, the initial data says:

Production Method | Quantity of Shoes | Workers | Machines
-----------------|-------------------|---------|----------
alpha            | 10                | 30      | 10
beta             | 10                | 25      | 7
gamma            | 10                | 22      | 5
delta            | 10                | 20      | 6
epsilon          | 10                | 20      | 5

So each method produces 10 dozen shoes, which is S=10. The production function is S = sqrt(W*M), so 10 = sqrt(W*M), which implies W*M = 100.

So for each method, W*M should equal 100 if they are technically efficient. Let me check each method:

Alpha: 30 * 10 = 300 → way more than 100. Not efficient.
Beta: 25 *7 =175 → more than 100.
Gamma: 22*5=110 → more than 100.
Delta:20*6=120 → more than 100.
Epsilon:20*5=100 → exactly 100. So epsilon is technically efficient because it's using the exact combination where W*M equals 100, which is the production function's requirement. 

So the question is asking which method is technically efficient. The answer should be epsilon, which is option D. Wait, looking back at the options:

Options are:

A: delta
B: alpha
C: alpha and beta combo
D: epsilon
E: gamma
F: alpha, beta, gamma combo
G: beta and epsilon
H: zeta (not in data)
I: gamma and delta
J: beta

So the correct answer is D: production method epsilon.
</think>

The production function \( S = \sqrt{W \cdot M} \) implies that for \( S = 10 \), \( W \cdot M = 100 \). Among the methods, epsilon has \( W = 20 \) and \( M = 5 \), yielding \( W \cdot M = 100 \), which is efficient. 

Answer: D
