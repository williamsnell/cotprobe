Okay, so I need to figure out how much interest Jerry will pay on his loan. The loan is $400 for 60 days at 6% per year. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, I remember that interest can be calculated using the simple interest formula. I think the formula is I = P * R * T. P is the principal amount, which is the initial amount borrowed, R is the annual interest rate, and T is the time in years.

Wait, but the time given here is 60 days, and the rate is per year. So I need to convert the days into years. There are 365 days in a year, right? So 60 days would be 60/365 of a year. Let me calculate that: 60 divided by 365. Let me see, 60 ÷ 365 is approximately 0.1644 years. I can use that as T.

Now, the principal P is $400, and the rate R is 6% per year, which is 0.06 in decimal form. So plugging these into the formula: I = 400 * 0.06 * (60/365).

Let me compute each part step by step. First, 400 multiplied by 0.06. So 400 * 0.06 is $24. That's the annual interest, I think. But since the loan is only for 60 days, I need to find what portion of that $24 applies to 60 days.

So, the time factor is 60/365, which is roughly 0.1644. Now, multiplying the annual interest by this fraction: $24 * 0.1644. Let me do that calculation. 24 times 0.16 is 3.84, and 24 times 0.0044 is about 0.1056. Adding those together, 3.84 + 0.1056 equals approximately 3.9456. So the interest is roughly $3.95, which is close to $4.00.

Wait, but let me check if I did that right. Alternatively, maybe I should calculate it more precisely. Let's compute 60 divided by 365 first. 60 ÷ 365 equals approximately 0.1643835616. Then, 400 * 0.06 is 24, as before. Now, 24 multiplied by 0.1643835616. Let me compute that:

24 * 0.1643835616. Let me break it down:

24 * 0.1 = 2.4

24 * 0.06 = 1.44

24 * 0.0043835616 ≈ 24 * 0.0044 ≈ 0.1056

Adding them up: 2.4 + 1.44 = 3.84; 3.84 + 0.1056 ≈ 3.9456. So yes, about $3.9456, which rounds to $3.95. Looking at the options, the closest is $4.00, which is option C.

Wait, but I should make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Another way to calculate it is to compute the daily interest rate first. The annual rate is 6%, so the daily rate is 6% divided by 365. So 0.06 / 365 ≈ 0.000164384 per day. Then, multiply that by the principal and the number of days: 400 * 0.000164384 * 60.

Let me compute that: 400 * 0.000164384 = 0.0657536 per day. Then, 0.0657536 * 60 ≈ 3.945216, which is again about $3.95. So that's consistent. So the interest is approximately $3.95, which rounds to $4.00. Therefore, the correct answer should be option C: $4.00.

The interest is calculated using the simple interest formula, I = P * R * T. Converting 60 days to a fraction of a year (60/365 ≈ 0.1644), the interest is $400 * 0.06 * 0.1644 ≈ $3.95, which rounds to $4.00. 

Answer: C
