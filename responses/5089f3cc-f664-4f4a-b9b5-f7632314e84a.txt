Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about the Sugar Act of 1764 and its goals. I need to figure out which option aligns most closely with the excerpt provided.

First, I'll read the excerpt carefully. It talks about establishing new provisions to improve the revenue of Great Britain, extend and secure navigation and commerce between Britain and the American dominions, which had expanded after the peace. It also mentions that it's just and necessary to raise revenue in the American dominions to cover the expenses of defending, protecting, and securing them. The parliament is making provisions to grant certain rates and duties to the king.

So, the main goals here seem to be raising revenue and improving trade and navigation with America. The Sugar Act was part of Britain's efforts to increase revenue from its colonies, particularly through taxes on sugar and other goods. It was also about asserting control and regulating trade more effectively after the expansion of their territories.

Now, looking at the options:

A: Decreasing federal income tax rates in the 1980s. That's about reducing taxes, which doesn't seem to match raising revenue. So probably not A.

B: Economic stimulus package during the 2008 crisis. These are about injecting money into the economy during a downturn, not about raising revenue through trade regulations. Doesn't fit.

C: Protective tariffs during the Industrial Revolution. Tariffs are taxes on imports, used to protect domestic industries and raise revenue. The Sugar Act was a tax on certain goods, similar to a tariff. This seems relevant.

D: Gold Standard in the 19th century. That's about monetary policy, not directly related to raising revenue through trade regulations. Not a match.

E: Deregulation in the 1980s. This is the opposite of creating new regulations like the Sugar Act. So E is out.

F: Federal Reserve in 1913. That's about monetary policy and banking, not about raising revenue through trade. Doesn't fit.

G: Free trade policies in the 1970s. Free trade would reduce tariffs and regulations, whereas the Sugar Act was about increasing them to collect revenue. So G doesn't match.

H: New Deal during the Great Depression. The New Deal was about government programs and spending to recover from the Depression. Not about raising revenue via trade. So H is not it.

I: Antitrust reforms in the Progressive Era. These were about breaking up monopolies, not about taxation or trade regulations for revenue. So I is out.

J: Increasing federal income tax after WWI. This is about income taxes, but the Sugar Act was about trade duties and specific goods, not income taxes. So J doesn't fit.

So, the closest match seems to be option C: Protective tariffs during the Industrial Revolution. Both involve using tariffs to raise revenue and regulate trade. The Sugar Act was a form of protective tariff, designed to tax certain goods coming into the colonies, thereby generating income for Britain and also controlling trade more effectively.

I think I've considered all the options, and C makes the most sense. The other options either deal with different economic policies or don't align with the goals of raising revenue and regulating commerce as stated in the excerpt.

The Sugar Act of 1764 aimed to raise revenue and regulate trade between Britain and its American colonies. The excerpt highlights the need for new provisions to improve revenue, extend navigation, and secure commerce, aligning with the use of tariffs to generate income and control trade. Among the options, the protective tariffs established during the Industrial Revolution (Option C) best match these goals, as they also served to raise revenue and regulate trade through taxes on imported goods.

Answer: C
