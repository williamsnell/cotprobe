Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about Cicero's beliefs. The question is asking what Cicero claims is sometimes permissible. The options are A through J. I remember that Cicero was a Roman philosopher and statesman, and he's known for his contributions to ethics and political philosophy. I think his ideas were based on Stoicism, but I'm not entirely sure. 

Let me go through each option one by one. 

Option A: commit acts of injustice. I don't think Cicero would support this. He was a proponent of natural law and justice, so committing injustice doesn't seem right. 

Option B: none of the above. Hmm, could be possible if none of the other options fit. But I need to check the others first.

Option C: harm others for personal gain. That sounds like a Utilitarian view, but Cicero was more about virtue and duties. So probably not.

Option D: act against societal norms. Cicero emphasized the importance of laws and societal order, so acting against norms might not be something he permits.

Option E: disobey laws. Wait, but Cicero talked about the laws of nature and the importance of just laws. Maybe if the law is unjust, but I'm not sure if he allows disobeying them. 

Option F: steal. That's clearly wrong according to most ethical systems, including Cicero's, so F is unlikely.

Option G: break one’s promises. Promises are part of trust and integrity. Cicero would probably say that breaking promises is wrong, so G is probably not the answer.

Option H: betray one's friends. Betrayal goes against friendship and trust, which Cicero valued, so H is probably not correct.

Option I: lie. Cicero was against lying because truth and honesty are important in his ethical framework, so I is not the answer.

Option J: act out of selfishness. Selfishness goes against the idea of the common good, which Cicero supported, so J is likely not the right choice.

Wait, but I'm not sure about option E. Did Cicero ever say it's permissible to disobey laws? Or did he think that the law is based on natural law and therefore should be followed unless it's unjust? I think he might have considered that if the law is unjust, it's not really a law, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps he allowed for civil disobedience in some cases. But I'm not entirely sure.

Another angle: I remember that Cicero talked about the role of the government and the idea that the laws should reflect natural justice. So if a law is unjust, it's not a true law. But does that mean it's permissible to disobey it? Or is it more about the law being invalid? I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, maybe I should think about other philosophers. For example, Aquinas discusses the idea that an unjust law is not a law, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's permissible to disobey it; it's just that the government shouldn't enforce it. But I'm not sure how Cicero would view this.

Alternatively, maybe none of the options fit, so the correct answer would be B: none of the above. But I thought there was an option that might fit. Let me reconsider.

Wait, another thought: Cicero was a Stoic, and Stoicism teaches that one should act according to nature and the rational order. So maybe he would say that sometimes, in extreme situations, it's permissible to act against societal norms if it's necessary for the greater good. So option D: act against societal norms could be permissible in some cases.

But I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, perhaps he allowed for certain exceptions where the law might conflict with higher principles. But I'm not sure if that's captured in the options.

Wait, let me think about each option again.

Option E: disobey laws. If the law is unjust, maybe it's permissible. But I'm not sure if that's exactly what Cicero said. Alternatively, perhaps he didn't allow it, so the answer would be B.

Alternatively, perhaps none of the options are correct, hence B. But I'm not confident. Another approach: I remember that Cicero was against tyranny and believed in the rule of law, but he also emphasized the importance of justice. So maybe he would say that it's never permissible to commit acts of injustice, harm others, etc., but perhaps in some cases, like for the greater good, one might have to act against societal norms or disobey laws. 

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should look for which of these options aligns with what I know about Cicero. He was against tyranny, supported the rule of law, and believed in natural rights. So perhaps he didn't permit any of these actions. Therefore, the correct answer might be B: none of the above.

Cicero, a Roman philosopher and statesman influenced by Stoicism, emphasized natural law, justice, and societal order. He advocated for virtuous and dutiful behavior, aligning with principles of honesty, integrity, and the common good. Upon examining the options, none of the listed actions—committing injustice, harming others, disobeying laws, etc.—align with Cicero's ethical framework. He would likely oppose these actions, as they contradict his emphasis on justice and natural law. Therefore, the correct answer is:

B: none of the above.
