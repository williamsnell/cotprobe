Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about the two principal answers to whether life has any meaning. The options are labeled A through J. I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think carefully.

The question is asking about the main answers regarding the meaning of life. I remember from philosophy that different schools of thought have various perspectives on this. Let me go through the options one by one.

Option A: Pessimist's view and Optimist's view. That makes sense because some people think life is inherently meaningless (pessimist) while others see it as meaningful (optimist). But I'm not sure if these are considered the principal answers.

Option B: Existentialist and Nihilist. Existentialists like Sartre argue that life has no inherent meaning, but we create our own. Nihilists also believe life is meaningless. So these two could be the main answers because they directly address the meaninglessness and how individuals might respond.

Option C: Deterministic and Free Will. Determinism suggests life is predestined, so maybe that relates to meaning, but I'm not sure if it's the principal answer. Free will is about choice, but the question is about meaning, not about choice itself.

Option D: Materialistic and Spiritual. Materialists focus on physical existence, while spiritualists look for meaning in the metaphysical. These are broad views, but are they the main answers to the meaning of life?

Option E: Empiricist and Rationalist. These are about how knowledge is acquired, not directly about the meaning of life, so probably not.

Option F: External and Internal. This could refer to external factors (like society) and internal (personal beliefs), but I'm not sure if these are the principal answers.

Option G: Theistic and Agnostic. Theistic views see life as meaningful through a higher power, while agnostics are uncertain. This could be relevant, but I'm not sure if these are the top two.

Option H: Monist and Dualist. Monism is about unity, dualism about duality. Not directly about meaning.

Option I: Relativist and Absolutist. Relativists say meaning is relative, absolutists say there's an inherent meaning. This could be relevant, but I'm not sure if these are the principal answers.

Option J: Religious and Liberal. Religious views are one angle, but "liberal" is too vague here.

So, going back, the question is about the two main answers. Existentialists and Nihilists both deal with the meaninglessness of life but approach it differently. Existentialists say we create meaning, while Nihilists say there's none. That seems like a strong pair. Alternatively, Optimist and Pessimist are more about outlooks, not specific philosophical answers.

I think the answer is B: the existentialist's view and the nihilist's view.

The question asks for the two principal answers to whether life has any meaning. Among the options, the existentialist and nihilist views are directly related to the discussion of life's meaning. Existentialists argue that life has no inherent meaning but that individuals can create their own, while nihilists assert that life is inherently meaningless. These perspectives are central to the philosophical debate on the topic. 

Answer: B
