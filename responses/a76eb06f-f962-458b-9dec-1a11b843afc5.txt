Okay, so I've got this problem about making salad dressing. The question says that the dressing is made by combining 2 parts vinegar with 5 parts oil. I need to find out how many ounces of oil should be mixed with 9 ounces of vinegar. The options are from A to J, and I have to pick the right one.

First, I'll try to understand the ratio given. It's 2 parts vinegar to 5 parts oil. That means for every 2 units of vinegar, I need 5 units of oil. So the ratio of vinegar to oil is 2:5. 

The problem gives me 9 ounces of vinegar. I need to figure out how much oil corresponds to that amount. Since the ratio is 2 parts vinegar to 5 parts oil, I can set up a proportion to solve for the unknown amount of oil.

Let me write that out. Let's say the amount of oil is x. Then the ratio can be written as 2/5 = 9/x. Wait, no, that's not right because vinegar is 2 parts and oil is 5 parts. So actually, vinegar is 2 parts, oil is 5 parts. So the ratio is vinegar : oil = 2 : 5. 

So, if 2 parts vinegar correspond to 5 parts oil, then 9 ounces of vinegar would correspond to x ounces of oil. So the proportion should be 2/5 = 9/x. Wait, no, that's not correct because vinegar is 2 and oil is 5. The correct way is to set up the proportion as vinegar part over oil part equals the given vinegar over the oil we need to find. So it's 2/5 = 9/x. 

Wait, no, maybe I should think of it differently. The ratio is 2 parts vinegar to 5 parts oil. So 2 parts vinegar correspond to 5 parts oil. So, if I have 9 ounces of vinegar, I need to find how much oil that would require. 

So, the ratio can be written as vinegar : oil = 2 : 5. So, 2 parts vinegar are to 5 parts oil as 9 ounces are to x ounces. That's the proportion: 2/5 = 9/x. 

To solve for x, I'll cross-multiply. So 2x = 5 * 9. That's 2x = 45. Then, x = 45 / 2, which is 22.5. 

Looking at the options, option B is 22.5. So the answer should be B.

Wait, let me double-check. Another way to think about it is to find out how much one part is. Since 2 parts vinegar equal 9 ounces, one part would be 9 / 2 = 4.5 ounces. Then, since oil is 5 parts, that would be 5 * 4.5 = 22.5 ounces. Yep, that confirms it. So the answer is definitely B.

The ratio of vinegar to oil is 2:5. For 9 ounces of vinegar, one part is 4.5 ounces. Five parts of oil equal 22.5 ounces.

Answer: B
