Alright, so I've got this logic problem here, and I'm supposed to figure out whether the argument is valid using indirect truth tables. If it's invalid, I need to pick a counterexample from the options given. Let me start by breaking down the problem step by step.

First, let's understand the argument structure. The argument is:

1. P ⊃ (Q ∨ R)
2. (Q · S) ⊃ ~P
3. ~(~Q ∨ R) / ~P

So, the premises are the first two statements, and the conclusion is ~P. My goal is to see if whenever the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true. If there's a case where the premises are true but the conclusion is false, the argument is invalid, and I need to find such a case.

I think the best approach here is to construct an indirect truth table. That means I'll consider all possible truth values for the atomic propositions P, Q, R, and S, and check if there's any row where the premises are true and the conclusion is false.

But wait, another approach is to see if the premises logically entail the conclusion. So, if I can derive ~P from the premises, the argument is valid. Let me try that.

Premise 1: P → (Q ∨ R)
Premise 2: (Q ∧ S) → ~P
Conclusion: ~P

Wait, but the conclusion is ~P. So, if I can derive ~P from the premises, then the argument is valid. Let me see if that's possible.

Alternatively, maybe I should look for a counterexample where the premises are true, but the conclusion is false. That would mean in such a case, P is true because the conclusion is ~P, which would be false when P is true.

So, let's think about when the conclusion is false. The conclusion is ~P, so it's false when P is true. So, in the counterexample, P must be true. Now, we also need the premises to be true.

So, let's set P to true. Now, with P = true, let's look at Premise 1: P → (Q ∨ R). Since P is true, the implication is only true if Q ∨ R is also true. So, Q ∨ R must be true. That means either Q is true, or R is true, or both.

Now, let's look at Premise 2: (Q ∧ S) → ~P. Since P is true, ~P is false. So the implication (Q ∧ S) → ~P is equivalent to (Q ∧ S) → false. An implication is false only when the antecedent is true and the consequent is false. So, for Premise 2 to be true when P is true, (Q ∧ S) must be false. That means either Q is false, or S is false, or both.

So, summarizing the conditions for a counterexample:

1. P = true (because the conclusion is ~P, which is false)
2. Q ∨ R = true (from Premise 1 being true)
3. Q ∧ S = false (from Premise 2 being true)

Now, let's consider possible assignments of Q, R, S that satisfy these conditions.

From condition 3, Q ∧ S is false. So, either Q is false, S is false, or both.

From condition 2, Q ∨ R is true. So, at least one of Q or R must be true.

I think the easiest way is to look for an assignment where P is true, Q is false, S is false (so Q ∧ S is false), and R is true (so Q ∨ R is true).

Wait, but if Q is false and R is true, then condition 2 is satisfied. Let me check:

- P = true
- Q = false
- R = true
- S can be anything as long as Q ∧ S is false, but since Q is false, S can be true or false; it doesn't matter because Q is already false.

But wait, let's see if any of the options match this scenario. Let me look at the options.

Option A: Invalid. Counterexample when P, Q, R, and S are true.

In this case, P is true, Q is true, R is true, S is true. Let's check the premises:

Premise 1: P → (Q ∨ R) = true → (true ∨ true) = true → true, which is true.

Premise 2: (Q ∧ S) → ~P = (true ∧ true) → false = true → false, which is false. So, Premise 2 is false here, meaning this isn't a valid counterexample because the premises must be true in the counterexample. So Option A is not correct.

Option D: Invalid. Counterexample when P and R are true and Q and S are false.

So P = true, Q = false, R = true, S = false.

Check Premise 1: P → (Q ∨ R) = true → (false ∨ true) = true → true, which is true.

Premise 2: (Q ∧ S) → ~P = (false ∧ false) → false = false → false. Wait, an implication with a false antecedent is always true. So (false → false) is true. So both premises are true here.

Conclusion: ~P is false because P is true. So this is a valid counterexample because the premises are true, but the conclusion is false.

So this would make the argument invalid, and Option D is a possible answer.

Wait, but let me check other options to make sure.

Option E: Invalid. Counterexample when P is true, Q, R, S are false.

So P = true, Q = false, R = false, S = false.

Premise 1: P → (Q ∨ R) = true → (false ∨ false) = true → false → which is false. So Premise 1 is false here, so this isn't a valid counterexample because the premises must be true. So Option E is incorrect.

Option F: Invalid. Counterexample when P and Q are true, R and S are false.

P = true, Q = true, R = false, S = false.

Premise 1: P → (Q ∨ R) = true → (true ∨ false) = true → true, which is true.

Premise 2: (Q ∧ S) → ~P = (true ∧ false) → false = false → false. So the implication is true because the antecedent is false. So both premises are true.

Conclusion: ~P is false because P is true. So this is another valid counterexample.

Wait, but in this case, Q is true, R is false, S is false. So Q ∨ R is true, and (Q ∧ S) is false, so both premises are true. So this is also a counterexample, making the argument invalid.

So both Options D and F are possible counterexamples. But the question says to choose an option which presents a counterexample, and there may be others.

Looking back at the options, D and F are both possible. Let me check the options again.

The options are:

A: Invalid. Counterexample when P, Q, R, and S are true

B: Valid

C: Valid. No counterexamples exist

D: Invalid. Counterexample when P and R are true and Q and S are false

E: Invalid. Counterexample when P is true, Q, R, and S are false

F: Invalid. Counterexample when P and Q are true and R and S are false

G: Invalid. Counterexample when P is false, Q, R, and S are true

H: Invalid. Counterexample when P, R, and S are true and Q is false

I: Invalid. Counterexample when P and S are true and Q and R are false

So, both D and F are correct counterexamples. But the question asks to select an option that presents a counterexample. Since both D and F are correct, but perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, let me reevaluate. The problem is to pick the correct option. Let me check each option again.

Option D: P and R are true, Q and S are false.

So P=true, Q=false, R=true, S=false.

Premise 1: P→(Q∨R)=true→(false∨true)=true→true, which is true.

Premise 2: (Q∧S)→~P=(false∧false)→false=false→false, which is true because the antecedent is false.

So premises are true, conclusion ~P is false. So D is a valid counterexample.

Option F: P and Q are true, R and S are false.

So P=true, Q=true, R=false, S=false.

Premise 1: P→(Q∨R)=true→(true∨false)=true→true, which is true.

Premise 2: (Q∧S)→~P=(true∧false)→false=false→false, which is true because the antecedent is false.

Conclusion: ~P is false, so this is also a valid counterexample.

So both D and F are correct, but looking at the options, perhaps the correct answer is D.

Wait, but the options don't have both as correct; I need to pick one. Let me see the options again.

The options are from A to I. The correct answer must be one of them. Let me see which of these options is listed.

In the options, D and F are both listed. So perhaps the answer is D or F.

Wait, but let me check if any other options fit.

Option H: P, R, S are true, Q is false.

So P=true, Q=false, R=true, S=true.

Premise 1: P→(Q∨R)=true→(false∨true)=true→true, which is true.

Premise 2: (Q∧S)→~P=(false∧true)→false=false→false, which is true.

Conclusion: ~P is false. So this is another counterexample.

So H is also a possible answer.

Hmm, but the options are given, and I need to pick the correct one. Let me see.

Wait, perhaps I should construct the truth table to find all possible counterexamples.

But maybe a better approach is to look for which of the options provided correctly represents a situation where the premises are true and the conclusion is false.

From the options, both D, F, and H seem to fit, but perhaps the answer is D.

Wait, let me think again. Let's take each option and check.

Option A: P, Q, R, S all true.

Premise 1: P→(Q∨R)=true→(true∨true)=true→true, which is true.

Premise 2: (Q∧S)→~P=(true∧true)→false= true→false, which is false. So the premises aren't both true here, so this isn't a counterexample. So A is incorrect.

Option B: Valid. So the argument is valid. But since I've found counterexamples, B is incorrect.

Option C: Valid. No counterexamples exist. Also incorrect because I have counterexamples.

Option D: P and R true, Q and S false.

As checked earlier, this is a valid counterexample.

Option E: P true, Q, R, S false.

Premise 1: P→(Q∨R)=true→(false∨false)=true→false, which is false. So E is incorrect.

Option F: P and Q true, R and S false.

This is a valid counterexample.

Option G: P false, Q, R, S true.

Conclusion is ~P, which is true. So the conclusion is true, but the premises may or may not be true.

But since in a counterexample, we need the premises to be true and the conclusion false. So if P is false, conclusion ~P is true, so it's not a counterexample. So G is incorrect.

Option H: P, R, S true, Q false.

So P=true, R=true, S=true, Q=false.

Premise 1: P→(Q∨R)=true→(false∨true)=true→true, which is true.

Premise 2: (Q∧S)→~P=(false∧true)→false=false→false, which is true.

Conclusion: ~P is false. So H is a valid counterexample.

Option I: P and S true, Q and R false.

So P=true, Q=false, R=false, S=true.

Premise 1: P→(Q∨R)=true→(false∨false)=true→false, which is false. So I is incorrect.

So the valid counterexamples are D, F, and H.

Looking back at the options, D, F, and H are all present. But the question asks to choose an option which presents a counterexample, and there may be others.

Wait, but the options are given, and I need to pick one. So perhaps the correct answer is D.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is F.

Wait, but let me check the options again.

The options are:

A: Invalid. Counterexample when P, Q, R, and S are true

B: Valid

C: Valid. No counterexamples exist

D: Invalid. Counterexample when P and R are true and Q and S are false

E: Invalid. Counterexample when P is true, Q, R, and S are false

F: Invalid. Counterexample when P and Q are true and R and S are false

G: Invalid. Counterexample when P is false, Q, R, and S are true

H: Invalid. Counterexample when P, R, and S are true and Q is false

I: Invalid. Counterexample when P and S are true and Q and R are false

So, the correct answer is that the argument is invalid, and any of D, F, or H would be correct. But among the options, which one is listed? All three are listed.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is D because it's the first one that fits.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for which of these options correctly satisfies the conditions.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me check Option D again.

Option D: P and R are true, Q and S are false.

So P=true, R=true, Q=false, S=false.

Premise 1: P→(Q∨R)=true→(false∨true)=true→true, which is true.

Premise 2: (Q∧S)→~P=(false∧false)→false=false→false, which is true because the antecedent is false. So both premises are true, and the conclusion ~P is false. So D is correct.

Similarly, for Option F: P and Q are true, R and S are false.

Premise 1: P→(Q∨R)=true→(true∨false)=true→true, which is true.

Premise 2: (Q∧S)→~P=(true∧false)→false=false→false, which is true.

Conclusion: ~P is false. So F is correct.

And for Option H: P, R, S are true, Q is false.

Premise 1: P→(Q∨R)=true→(false∨true)=true→true, which is true.

Premise 2: (Q∧S)→~P=(false∧true)→false=false→false, which is true.

Conclusion: ~P is false. So H is correct.

So all three options D, F, and H are valid counterexamples. But looking back at the options provided, I need to select one.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is D because it's the first option that correctly presents a counterexample.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is F because it's another valid counterexample.

Wait, but the question is asking to choose an option that presents a counterexample, and there may be others. So any of D, F, or H would be correct. But I need to pick one from the options.

Looking at the options, perhaps D is the correct choice because it's the first one that fits.

Wait, but the options are:

A: Invalid. Counterexample when P, Q, R, and S are true

B: Valid

C: Valid. No counterexamples exist

D: Invalid. Counterexample when P and R are true and Q and S are false

E: Invalid. Counterexample when P is true, Q, R, and S are false

F: Invalid. Counterexample when P and Q are true and R and S are false

G: Invalid. Counterexample when P is false, Q, R, and S are true

H: Invalid. Counterexample when P, R, and S are true and Q is false

I: Invalid. Counterexample when P and S are true and Q and R are false

So, the correct answer is that the argument is invalid, and any of D, F, or H is a correct counterexample. So the answer is either D, F, or H.

But in the options, the first correct one is D. So I think the answer is D.
</think>

The argument is invalid because there are counterexamples where the premises are true, and the conclusion is false. One such counterexample is when P and R are true, and Q and S are false. This satisfies all conditions, making the argument invalid.

Answer: D
