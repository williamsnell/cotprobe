Okay, so I've got this problem here about Mr. Howard's house tax. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

First, the house's worth is $16,500, and it's assessed at 22%. Hmm, I think that means the tax is calculated based on a percentage of that assessed value. So, I should calculate 22% of $16,500. Let me do that. 

22% of 16,500. Oh wait, 10% is $1,650. So 20% is $3,300. Then 2% is $330. Adding those gives 22% as $3,630. So, the assessed value is $3,630. 

Now, the tax rates are per $100. So for each portion of $100, the rate applies. Let's see: the rates are $.41 for a local college fund, $.02 for special education, $.001 for health and welfare, and $.089 for community construction. 

Wait, so each $100 is taxed at different rates. So, I'll need to calculate how much each category applies to the assessed value of $3,630.

Let me calculate each part:

1. Local college fund: $0.41 per $100. So, $3,630 / $100 = 36.3. Multiply by $0.41. Let me do that: 36 * 0.41 is 14.76, and 0.3 * 0.41 is 0.123, so total is 14.76 + 0.123 = $14.883. Approximately $14.88.

2. Special education: $0.02 per $100. 36.3 * 0.02 = $0.726, which is $0.73 when rounded.

3. Health and welfare: $0.001 per $100. 36.3 * 0.001 = $0.0363, which rounds to $0.04.

4. Community construction: $0.089 per $100. 36.3 * 0.089. Let me compute that. 36 * 0.089 is 3.204, and 0.3 * 0.089 is 0.0267, so total is about 3.2307, which is $3.23.

Now, add all these up.

$14.88 (college) + $0.73 (special) = $15.61.

Then, $15.61 + $0.04 (health) = $15.65.

$15.65 + $3.23 (community) = $18.88.

So the total tax would be $18.88. Looking at the options, option C is $18.88. 

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations. Maybe I missed something. Let me re-calculate each part.

For the special education: 36.3 * 0.02 = $0.726 → $0.73.

Health: 36.3 * 0.001 = $0.0363 → $0.04.

Community: 36.3 * 0.089.

Let me do that multiplication again: 36 * 0.089 is 3.204. 0.3 * 0.089 is 0.0267. So 3.204 + 0.0267 = 3.2307, which is $3.23.

So adding all together:

14.88 (college) + 0.73 (special) = 15.61.

15.61 + 0.04 (health) = 15.65.

15.65 + 3.23 (community) = 18.88.

Yes, that's correct. So the total tax is $18.88, which is option C.

The assessed value of Mr. Howard's house is 22% of $16,500, which is $3,630. Calculating the tax based on each category:

1. **Local College Fund:** $0.41 per $100 → 36.3 * $0.41 = $14.883 → $14.88.
2. **Special Education:** $0.02 per $100 → 36.3 * $0.02 = $0.726 → $0.73.
3. **Health and Welfare:** $0.001 per $100 → 36.3 * $0.001 = $0.0363 → $0.04.
4. **Community Construction:** $0.089 per $100 → 36.3 * $0.089 = $3.2307 → $3.23.

Adding these amounts: $14.88 + $0.73 + $0.04 + $3.23 = $18.88.

**ANSWER: C**
