Okay, so I have this question about translating the sentence "Johnny came late" into predicate logic. I'm a bit new to this, so I need to take it step by step.

First, I should break down the sentence. It's a simple statement with two parts: the subject is Johnny, and he performed an action which is "came late." In predicate logic, the structure usually involves a predicate (a verb phrase or adjective) and a subject.

So, "Johnny came late" can be rephrased as "Johnny is late." That makes it clearer. The predicate here is "is late," which can be represented as a predicate function. Let's denote 'L' as the predicate for being late. Then, 'C' might represent the action of coming late, but in this case, it's more about the state of being late, so maybe 'L' is better.

Now, the subject is Johnny. In predicate logic, we often use lowercase letters for individuals. So 'j' could represent Johnny. So, putting it together, the predicate would be Lj, where 'L' is the predicate meaning 'is late' and 'j' is Johnny.

Looking at the options, I need to find which one matches Lj. Let's go through the options:

A: Lj ∨ Cj – This is Lj OR Cj, which means either Johnny is late or he came late. But the original sentence is just stating that Johnny came late, which implies he is late, not a choice between being late or coming late.

B: Lj – This is simply Johnny is late. That seems correct because "came late" implies he arrived after the scheduled time, so he is late.

C: L∧j – This looks like a conjunction, but the notation is unclear. Usually, predicates are written as functions, so Lj would be correct, not L ∧ j.

D: jC – This seems like an attempt to represent "Johnny came," but the notation is off. In predicate logic, the predicate usually comes first, so it should be Cj if 'C' is the predicate for coming. But the original sentence adds "late," so maybe 'C' would need to be something like cameLate, but the options don't specify that.

E: j ∨ L – This is Johnny OR L, which doesn't make sense in this context. The sentence is about Johnny's state, not a choice between Johnny and being late.

F: Lj ∧ Cj – This would mean Johnny is both late and came late. That's more than what the sentence states. The sentence just says he came late, which implies he is late, but it's redundant to say both.

G: Cj ∨ Lj – Similar to option A, this is a disjunction, which doesn't fit the straightforward statement.

H: Lx – This uses 'x' as the variable, but the subject is Johnny, so 'x' isn't specified here. It's more general, but the sentence is specific to Johnny.

I: jL – This seems like an incorrect notation. It might be trying to say Johnny is late, but the order is wrong. Typically, the subject comes first, followed by the predicate, so Lj is correct.

J: Cx – Again, this is using 'x' as the variable, which isn't specific to Johnny, and the predicate 'C' might represent coming, but without the 'late' part, it's incomplete.

So, the best fit is option B: Lj, which directly translates to "Johnny is late." The other options either add unnecessary parts or don't correctly represent the subject-predicate structure.

The sentence "Johnny came late" can be translated into predicate logic as "Johnny is late," which is represented as Lj, where 'L' is the predicate for being late and 'j' is Johnny.

Answer: B
