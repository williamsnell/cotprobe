Okay, so I have this question about relativistic equations, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let's break it down step by step.

The question is asking about when relativistic equations for time dilation, length contraction, relativistic momentum, and energy hold true. The options are from A to J, each suggesting different conditions.

First, I remember that relativity, specifically Einstein's theory, comes into play at high speeds, approaching the speed of light. I think the key here is that these effects like time dilation and length contraction only become significant when objects are moving at a substantial fraction of the speed of light. At everyday speeds, these effects are so tiny that we don't notice them, which is why classical mechanics works fine for most situations.

So looking at the options, option C says "at everyday low speeds." That doesn't sound right because relativity isn't needed then. Option B is "at speeds near that of light," which seems more accurate because that's when relativistic effects become noticeable. Option H says "only at speeds that are a significant fraction of the speed of light." That also sounds correct, but I'm a bit confused between B and H.

Wait, B says "near the speed of light," which is a very high speed, while H mentions a significant fraction, which could be a bit lower but still high. But both B and H are talking about high speeds. The question is about when the equations hold true. I think the correct understanding is that these relativistic effects are non-negligible when speeds are a significant fraction of the speed of light, not necessarily only when they're extremely close. So H might be the better answer because it's more precise.

Option D says "at all speeds," which can't be right because relativity doesn't apply to all speedsâ€”classical mechanics takes over at lower speeds. So D is incorrect.

Looking back, the original question is about when the relativistic equations are valid. They are valid when speeds are a significant fraction of light speed, so H is the correct option. B might be a subset of H, but H is more accurate in the context of when the effects hold true, not just extremely high speeds.

The relativistic equations for time dilation, length contraction, relativistic momentum, and energy are significant when objects move at speeds that are a substantial fraction of the speed of light. These effects become noticeable only at such high speeds, making option H the correct choice.

Answer: H
