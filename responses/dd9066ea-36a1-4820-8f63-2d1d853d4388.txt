Question:

Suppose that the alleles for eye color for a certain male fruit fly are $(R, W)$ and the alleles for eye color for the mating female fruit fly are $(R, W)$, where $R$ and $W$ represent red and white, respectively. Their offspring receive one allele for eye color from each parent. Assume that each of the four possible outcomes has equal probability. If an offspring ends up with either two white alleles or one red and one white allele for eye color, its eyes will look white. Given that an offspring's eyes look white, what is the conditional probability that it has two white alleles for eye color?

Options:

A: $\frac{1}{3}$
B: $\frac{4}{5}$
C: $\frac{1}{5}$
D: $\frac{1}{4}$
E: $\frac{2}{5}$
F: $\frac{1}{2}$
G: $\frac{3}{4}$
H: $\frac{5}{6}$
I: $\frac{3}{5}$
J: $\frac{2}{3}$

Okay, so I have this probability question about fruit flies and their eye color alleles. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step. 

First, the question says that both the male and the female fruit fly have alleles (R, W) for eye color. R stands for red, and W for white. So each parent can pass on either R or W to their offspring. 

The offspring gets one allele from each parent, right? So the possible combinations are: RR, RW, WR, and WW. Wait, no, because each parent gives one allele. So the possible combinations for the offspring's alleles would be:

- From the father: R or W
- From the mother: R or W

So the four possible outcomes are:

1. R (from father) and R (from mother) → RR
2. R (father) and W (mother) → RW
3. W (father) and R (mother) → WR
4. W (father) and W (mother) → WW

Wait, but since the parents are the same, and each outcome is equally probable, each of these four has a 1/4 chance. But I think in reality, the order might not matter because RW and WR are both red and white, but the question might consider them as the same outcome. Wait, no, the question says each of the four possible outcomes has equal probability. So I think the four possibilities are considered distinct, so each is 1/4.

Now, the question states that if an offspring ends up with either two white alleles (WW) or one red and one white (RW or WR), then their eyes look white. So the cases where the eyes look white are WW, RW, and WR. So that's three out of the four possible outcomes. The only case where the eyes don't look white is RR.

But wait, the question asks for the conditional probability that the offspring has two white alleles (WW) given that the eyes look white. So we're looking for P(WW | eyes white).

In probability terms, conditional probability is calculated as P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B). But in this case, if A is WW and B is eyes white, then A is a subset of B. So P(A ∩ B) is just P(A). So it's P(WW) divided by P(eyes white).

We know that each of the four outcomes is equally likely, so each has a probability of 1/4. So:

P(WW) = 1/4.

Now, the cases where eyes are white are when the alleles are WW, RW, or WR. So that's three outcomes, each 1/4, so P(eyes white) = 3/4.

So the conditional probability is (1/4) divided by (3/4) which equals 1/3.

Wait, but let me double-check. The possible alleles are RR (which would have red eyes), RW (white), WR (white), and WW (white). So the white cases are three: RW, WR, WW. So when given that the eyes are white, the probability that it's WW is 1 out of the 3 white cases. So 1/3, which is option A.

Alternatively, maybe I'm making a mistake in counting the possible outcomes. Let me think again. Each parent contributes one allele, so the possible combinations are:

- Father R, Mother R → RR
- Father R, Mother W → RW
- Father W, Mother R → WR
- Father W, Mother W → WW

Each outcome is 1/4, so yes, four possibilities. So when eyes are white, it's when the offspring has either RW, WR, or WW. So three outcomes. So the chance of WW given that the eyes are white is 1/3, which is option A.

The conditional probability is calculated by dividing the probability of the offspring having two white alleles (WW) by the probability of the eyes being white. Since each of the four possible allele combinations is equally likely, the probability of WW is 1/4. The probability of the eyes being white includes the cases WW, RW, and WR, which totals 3/4. Therefore, the conditional probability is (1/4) / (3/4) = 1/3.

Answer: A
