Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure out the number of collisions per second that air molecules have with the surface of an average human. Let's try to break this down step by step.

First, the problem states that air is 20 mole percent O₂ and 80 mole percent N₂. The total external surface area of a human is 2.0 m². We're at 25°C and 1 atm. I need to estimate the number of collisions per second.

Hmm, I remember that the number of collisions per second can be related to the concept of collision rate in gases. I think the formula involves the root mean square speed of the gas molecules and the number of molecules per unit volume.

Wait, right! The collision rate (number of collisions per second per unit area) might be given by the formula: 

Collision rate = (1/4) * n * v_rms

Where:
- n is the number of molecules per unit volume,
- v_rms is the root mean square speed.

Alternatively, I think it's sometimes expressed as (n * v_rms) / 4, but I'm not entirely sure about the factor. Maybe it's better to look for a standard formula.

I recall that the collision rate (Z) can be calculated using the formula:

Z = 4 * sqrt((2 * π * m * k * T)) / (λ * sqrt(3))

Wait, no, maybe that's not right. Alternatively, I think the collision rate per unit area is given by:

Z = (n * v_rms) / 4

But wait, another approach is to use the ideal gas law to find the number of molecules per unit volume, then compute the average speed, and then find the number of collisions per second per unit area.

Let me think. The ideal gas law is PV = nRT. So the number of moles per volume is n = P/(RT). Then, the number of molecules per volume would be N = n * Avogadro's number.

Wait, but the problem gives mole fractions, so maybe I can compute the average molar mass first. Air is 20% O₂ and 80% N₂. O₂ has a molar mass of 32 g/mol (since O is 16 each), and N₂ is 28 g/mol.

So the average molar mass M = (0.2 * 32) + (0.8 * 28) = 6.4 + 22.4 = 28.8 g/mol.

Now, using the ideal gas law at 25°C (which is 298 K) and 1 atm. Let's compute the number of molecules per unit volume.

First, n (moles per m³) is P/(RT). R is 8.314 J/(mol·K), P is 1 atm. Wait, I need to convert atm to Pascals because R is in J/(mol·K) and 1 atm is 101325 Pa.

So n = P/(RT) = (101325 Pa) / (8.314 J/(mol·K) * 298 K).

Calculating that: 101325 / (8.314 * 298) ≈ let's see.

8.314 * 298 ≈ 2477.572. So 101325 / 2477.572 ≈ approximately 40.87 moles/m³.

Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Oh wait, 1 atm is about 101325 Pa. So 101325 divided by (8.314 * 298) → yes, that's correct. So n ≈ 40.87 mol/m³.

Now, Avogadro's number is 6.022e23 molecules/mol. So the number of molecules per m³ is N = n * Avogadro's number = 40.87 * 6.022e23 ≈ 2.46e25 molecules/m³.

Next, I need the root mean square velocity (v_rms). The formula is sqrt(3RT/(M)), where M is the molar mass in kg/mol.

Wait, M is 28.8 g/mol, which is 0.0288 kg/mol.

So v_rms = sqrt(3 * R * T / M).

Plugging in the numbers: 3 * 8.314 * 298 / 0.0288.

Calculating numerator: 3 * 8.314 ≈ 24.942; 24.942 * 298 ≈ 7455.8 (approx 7456).

Then, 7456 / 0.0288 ≈ 259,  let me compute 7456 ÷ 0.0288.

Wait, 0.0288 is 2.88e-2. So 7456 / 0.0288 = 7456 * (1/0.0288) ≈ 7456 * 34.7222 ≈ approximately 259,  let's see: 7456 * 34.7222 ≈ 7456 *34 is 253, 104, and 7456 * 0.7222 is about 5,382. So total around 258,486.

So v_rms = sqrt(258486) ≈ 508 m/s.

Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me check again:

3RT/M: 3 * 8.314 * 298 / 0.0288.

Wait, 8.314 * 298 = 2477.572; multiply by 3 gives 7432.716. Divided by 0.0288: 7432.716 / 0.0288 ≈ 258,  (since 0.0288 * 258,000 = 7430.4), yes, close.

So v_rms is sqrt(258,000) ≈ 508 m/s.

Now, the collision rate per unit area is given by (N * v_rms) / 4, I think. Because the formula for the collision rate per unit area (like a wall) is (1/4) n v_rms, where n is the number density (molecules/m³).

Wait, no, I think the correct formula is:

The collision rate (number of collisions per second per unit area) is (n * v_rms) / 4.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused about the exact formula. Alternatively, the flux (molecules per m² per second) is n * v_rms. So the number of collisions per m² per second would be n * v_rms * (some factor). For a wall, each collision involves a molecule hitting the wall, so maybe it's (n * v_rms) / 2 or something. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is (1/4) n v_rms.

Wait, another approach: the mean free path is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions, which is λ = 1/(n * π * d²), where d is the diameter of the molecule. But I'm not sure if I need that here.

Alternatively, the collision rate per unit area (Z) can be calculated as Z = (n * v_rms) / 4, because each molecule collides every v_rms/(4 * d), but maybe that's not the right way.

Wait, maybe it's better to find the total number of collisions per second on the entire surface area. So, total collisions per second would be surface area multiplied by the collision rate per m².

So, the collision rate per m² per second is (n * v_rms) / 4, as per some references I've seen before.

So, n is 2.46e25 molecules/m³, v_rms is 508 m/s.

So, per m², the number of collisions per second would be (2.46e25 * 508) /4.

Wait, let's compute that:

2.46e25 * 508 = 2.46 *508 = approx 1253.88, so 1.25388e28. Then divide by 4: 3.1347e27 collisions per m² per second.

Wait, that seems way too high. Let me check again.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating n. Let me double-check n: n was 40.87 mol/m³, and Avogadro's number is 6.022e23, so 40.87 * 6.022e23 = 2.46e25 molecules/m³. That's correct.

v_rms was 508 m/s. So n*v_rms = 2.46e25 * 508 = 1.25e28 molecules/(m²·s). Then divided by 4, that's 3.13e27 per m² per second.

But wait, the human's surface area is 2 m², so total collisions per second would be 3.13e27 * 2 = 6.26e27 collisions per second.

Looking at the options, I don't see that. Wait, the options are a bit different. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A: 3.14 ×10^25
B: 6.023e23 molecules/mole
C: 1.23e22 cm^-2 s^-1
D: 2 ×8.314e7 ×298 → that's 2*8.314e7*298 = let's see, 8.314e7 is 83,140,000. 83,140,000 *298 ≈ 24,814,  83,140,000 * 300 is 24,942,000,000, so about 24.8e9. Multiply by 2: ~49.6e9, which is 4.96e10. Hmm, not matching.

E: 2.885e23 cm^-2 s^-1
F: 1.66e21 molecules/mole
G:4.52e23 cm^-2 s^-1
H:9.86e24
I:5.77e27
J:7.89e26

Wait, my calculation gave 6.26e27 per second. That's close to option I:5.77e27, but not exactly. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, maybe I used the wrong formula. Let's think again. Another approach is to use the collision rate per unit area as (n * v) / 4, where v is the average speed, but perhaps I should use the mean speed instead of rms speed.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me try a different approach. The collision rate per unit area is given by the formula:

Z = (P * Avogadro) / (sqrt(2 * π * M * R * T)) )

Wait, no, perhaps I should use the formula for flux, which is n * v_rms.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula for collision rate per unit area is (n * v_rms) * (1/4), as I thought before. But maybe I should use the average speed (v_avg) instead of v_rms. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the mean speed (v_mean) which is sqrt(8/3) times v_rms.

Wait, the mean speed v_mean is sqrt(8/(3)) * v_rms. So maybe I should use v_mean instead.

Wait, but in the earlier calculation, I used v_rms. Let me see: if I use v_mean, then v_mean = sqrt(8/(3)) * v_rms ≈ 1.128 * v_rms.

Hmm, but let's see if that's the right approach. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Z = (1/4) * n * v_rms.

Wait, but in any case, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the formula. Let me check a standard reference.

I recall that the number of collisions per second per unit area (flux) is given by:

Z = (n * v_rms) / 4

So, using that, let's compute it again.

n = 2.46e25 molecules/m³

v_rms = 508 m/s

So, per m² per second: (2.46e25 * 508) /4 = (2.46e25 *508)/4 = (1.25e28) /4 = 3.125e27 collisions/(m²·s)

For a surface area of 2 m²: 3.125e27 * 2 = 6.25e27 collisions/s.

But the options don't have this. Hmm. The closest option is I:5.77e27, which is about 5.77e27, which is a bit lower than 6.25e27. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of v_rms.

Wait, let's recalculate v_rms.

v_rms = sqrt(3RT/(M))

M is 28.8 g/mol = 0.0288 kg/mol.

So,

3RT/M = 3 * 8.314 * 298 / 0.0288.

Calculating numerator: 3 *8.314 ≈24.942; 24.942 *298≈7455.8.

Divide by 0.0288: 7455.8 / 0.0288 ≈259, 000.

So sqrt(259,000) ≈509 m/s. Close to earlier value.

Wait, perhaps I should use mean speed instead. v_mean = sqrt(8/(3)) * v_rms ≈1.128 *509≈577 m/s.

Wait, if I use v_mean, then:

Z = n * v_mean /4 = (2.46e25 *577)/4 ≈ (1.418e28)/4 ≈3.545e27 per m² per second.

Multiply by 2 m²:7.09e27, which is higher than before. Still not matching any option.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Z = (n * v_rms)/2. Let's try that.

n=2.46e25, v_rms=508 m/s.

(2.46e25 *508)/2 = (1.25e28)/2 =6.25e27 per m²/s. Multiply by 2 m²:1.25e28 collisions/s. Not an option.

Hmm, none of the options seem to match this. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial n calculation.

Wait, let's recalculate n. P=1 atm=101325 Pa.

n (mol/m³) = P/(R T) =101325/(8.314*298).

8.314 *298=2477.572.

101325 /2477.572 ≈40.87 mol/m³. Correct.

Number of molecules per m³:40.87 *6.022e23≈2.46e25. Correct.

Another approach: perhaps I should consider that the collision rate can also be expressed as (P * Avogadro) / sqrt(2 * pi * M * R T). Wait, let me think. Another formula I found is:

Z = (P * N_A) / sqrt(2 * pi * M * R T)} 

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me try.

Z would be in molecules/(m²·s). Because pressure is in Pascals (N/m²), which is kg/(m·s²). So, P * N_A is (kg/(m·s²)) * (molecules/mol) * (mol). Wait, perhaps it's better to compute this.

Wait, perhaps the formula is Z = (P * N_A) / sqrt(2 * pi * M * R T).

Wait, let me compute that.

P=101325 Pa,

N_A=6.022e23 molecules/mol,

M=0.0288 kg/mol,

R=8.314 J/(mol·K),

T=298 K.

So,

Z = (101325 * 6.022e23) / sqrt(2 * pi * 0.0288 *8.314 *298)

Compute denominator:

2 * pi ≈6.2832,

6.2832 *0.0288≈0.181,

0.181 *8.314≈1.503,

1.503 *298≈447.3.

So sqrt(447.3)≈21.15.

Now numerator:

101325 *6.022e23 ≈6.097e28.

So Z=6.097e28 /21.15 ≈2.88e27 molecules/(m²·s).

Multiply by surface area 2 m²:2.88e27 *2=5.76e27 collisions/s.

Looking at options, option I is 5.77e27, which matches this value closely.

Ah, so I think I must have used the wrong formula earlier, and this approach gives the correct answer, which is option I.
</think>

To estimate the number of collisions per second of air molecules with the surface of an average human being, we start by calculating the number density of air molecules and their root mean square (rms) speed. Using the ideal gas law, the number density \( n \) is found to be approximately \( 2.46 \times 10^{25} \, \text{molecules/m}^3 \). The rms speed of air molecules is calculated as \( v_{\text{rms}} \approx 508 \, \text{m/s} \).

The collision rate per unit area is given by the formula:

\[
Z = \frac{n \cdot v_{\text{rms}}}{4}
\]

Substituting the values, the collision rate per square meter per second is approximately \( 3.13 \times 10^{27} \, \text{collisions/m}^2\text{s} \). Multiplying this by the total surface area of \( 2.0 \, \text{m}^2 \), the total number of collisions per second is approximately \( 6.26 \times 10^{27} \, \text{collisions/s} \).

However, using an alternative formula for the collision rate:

\[
Z = \frac{P \cdot N_A}{\sqrt{2 \pi M R T}}
\]

where \( P = 101325 \, \text{Pa} \), \( N_A = 6.022 \times 10^{23} \, \text{molecules/mol} \), \( M = 0.0288 \, \text{kg/mol} \), \( R = 8.314 \, \text{J/(mol·K)} \), and \( T = 298 \, \text{K} \), we find the collision rate per square meter per second to be approximately \( 2.88 \times 10^{27} \, \text{collisions/m}^2\text{s} \). Multiplying by the surface area of \( 2.0 \, \text{m}^2 \), the total number of collisions per second is approximately \( 5.76 \times 10^{27} \, \text{collisions/s} \), which closely matches option I.
