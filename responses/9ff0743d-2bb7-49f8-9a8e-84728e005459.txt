Okay, so I've got this problem here about finding three real numbers that are not in the domain of a function f(x). The function is given as f(x) = 1 divided by [1 + (1 divided by (1 + (1 divided by x)))] and I need to find the sum of the three numbers that are excluded from the domain. The options are labeled from A to J, and I need to pick the correct one.

Hmm, let me start by understanding what the domain of a function is. The domain is all the real numbers x for which the function is defined. Since this function has several layers of fractions, I should look for values of x that would make any denominator zero because division by zero is undefined. So, I need to find all x where any part of this expression would result in division by zero.

Let me break down the function step by step. The function is:

f(x) = 1 / [1 + (1 / (1 + (1/x)))]

Let me write this more clearly with fractions:

f(x) = 1 / [1 + 1/(1 + 1/x)]

Let me work from the inside out. The innermost part is 1/x. So, the first thing to note is that x cannot be zero because 1/x would be undefined. So, x = 0 is definitely one of the numbers not in the domain.

Now, moving outward, the next part is 1 + 1/x. Let me denote this as A for a moment. So, A = 1 + 1/x. Then, the next part is 1/A, which is 1/(1 + 1/x). For 1/A to be defined, A cannot be zero. So, 1 + 1/x ≠ 0.

Let me solve 1 + 1/x = 0 for x. That would give 1/x = -1, so x = -1. So, x = -1 is another number not in the domain because it would make the denominator zero in that part of the function.

Now, moving up to the next layer, we have 1 + 1/(1 + 1/x). Let me call this B. So, B = 1 + 1/(1 + 1/x). Then, the entire function f(x) is 1/B. So, B cannot be zero either because we can't divide by zero. Therefore, 1 + 1/(1 + 1/x) ≠ 0.

Let me solve 1 + 1/(1 + 1/x) = 0. Subtracting 1 from both sides gives 1/(1 + 1/x) = -1. Taking the reciprocal of both sides, we get 1 + 1/x = -1. Then, subtracting 1 from both sides: 1/x = -2, so x = -1/2. So, x = -1/2 is the third number not in the domain.

Wait, so far I have x = 0, x = -1, and x = -1/2. That's three numbers. Let me double-check if there are any more.

Looking back at the function f(x) = 1/[1 + 1/(1 + 1/x)], I can also approach this by simplifying the expression step by step to see if other restrictions emerge.

Let me try to simplify the denominator:

Denominator D = 1 + 1/(1 + 1/x)

Let me express 1 + 1/x as (x + 1)/x. So, 1/(1 + 1/x) becomes x/(x + 1). Then, D becomes 1 + x/(x + 1).

To add 1 and x/(x + 1), I can write 1 as (x + 1)/(x + 1). So, D = (x + 1)/(x + 1) + x/(x + 1) = [x + 1 + x]/(x + 1) = (2x + 1)/(x + 1).

So, the denominator D is (2x + 1)/(x + 1). Therefore, f(x) = 1/D = (x + 1)/(2x + 1).

Wait, so f(x) simplifies to (x + 1)/(2x + 1). But wait, that's only after simplifying, but I have to make sure that all the steps I took are valid.

In simplifying, I assumed that 1 + 1/x is not zero, which we already handled when x = -1. Also, when simplifying, the denominator D cannot be zero, which would happen when (2x + 1)/(x + 1) = 0. But a fraction is zero when the numerator is zero and the denominator is non-zero. So, 2x + 1 = 0 → x = -1/2, but we've already found that x = -1/2 is excluded because it makes the denominator of the previous step zero. Wait, but in this simplified form, the denominator D is (2x + 1)/(x + 1). So, D would be zero only if 2x + 1 = 0, so x = -1/2, but that's already accounted for.

Wait, but when simplifying, f(x) becomes (x + 1)/(2x + 1), but this is only valid when all the previous denominators are non-zero. So, the simplified function's domain is the same as the original function's domain, except perhaps for some extra points, but I think we've covered all the exclusions.

So, from the simplified function f(x) = (x + 1)/(2x + 1), we can see that the only restriction is when 2x + 1 = 0 → x = -1/2. But wait, that's not correct because in the original function, there were more restrictions.

Wait, in the simplified function, the denominator is (2x + 1), so x cannot be -1/2 because that would make the denominator zero. But from the original function, we already have x cannot be 0, -1, or -1/2.

Wait, but when I simplified f(x) to (x + 1)/(2x + 1), I think I might have missed some steps. Let me double-check my simplification.

Original denominator D = 1 + 1/(1 + 1/x) = 1 + [x/(x + 1)] as I did before. Then, D = (x + 1 + x)/(x + 1) → (2x + 1)/(x + 1). So, yes, that's correct.

So, f(x) = 1/D = (x + 1)/(2x + 1). So, f(x) is defined as (x + 1)/(2x + 1) except when x makes any denominator in the original expression zero.

Therefore, the domain of f(x) is all real numbers except x = 0, x = -1, and x = -1/2.

Wait, but in the simplified function f(x) = (x + 1)/(2x + 1), the denominator is zero when 2x + 1 = 0 → x = -1/2, which we already have as an exclusion. But in the original function, we also had x cannot be 0 or -1 because those make denominators in the intermediate steps zero. So, the three excluded numbers are 0, -1, and -1/2.

Now, the problem asks for the sum of these three numbers. So, 0 + (-1) + (-1/2) = 0 - 1 - 0.5 = -1.5.

Wait, but let me check if I made any mistakes in identifying the excluded x's.

First, x cannot be 0 because 1/x would be undefined.

Second, in the expression 1 + 1/x, setting this to zero gives x = -1, which is another exclusion.

Third, in the expression 1 + [1/(1 + 1/x)], we set that equal to zero and found x = -1/2, which is the third exclusion.

So, the three x's are 0, -1, and -1/2.

Summing them: 0 + (-1) + (-1/2) = -1.5, which is -3/2. Looking at the options, C is -1.5, so that's the answer.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss any other exclusions. For example, when simplifying f(x), I ended up with (x + 1)/(2x + 1), but the domain is still restricted by the original function's exclusions, so I think I covered all three points correctly.

Therefore, the sum is -1.5, which is option C.
</think>

The function \( f(x) = \frac{1}{1+\frac{1}{1+\frac{1}{x}}} \) has three values of \( x \) excluded from its domain: \( x = 0 \), \( x = -1 \), and \( x = -\frac{1}{2} \). The sum of these three numbers is \( 0 + (-1) + (-\frac{1}{2}) = -1.5 \).

Answer: C
