Okay, so I've got this question about polynomials and linear operators. Let me try to break it down. The question is about finding the null space and range of the derivative operator D on a certain set of polynomials. I'm a bit rusty on my linear algebra, but I'll try to think it through.

First, let's parse the problem. We're dealing with polynomials P where each polynomial has coefficients in Z_5, which is the integers modulo 5. The degree of each polynomial is less than or equal to 7, so they can go from constant terms up to x^7. So, the space P is a vector space over Z_5.

The operator D takes a polynomial p(x) and sends it to its derivative p'(x). We need to find the dimensions of the null space (n) and the range (r) of D. Then, from the options given, pick the correct pair (n, r).

Hmm. So, the null space of D consists of all polynomials p(x) such that D(p(x)) = 0. That is, all polynomials whose derivative is zero. In calculus, the derivative of a constant is zero, so any constant polynomial would be in the null space. But wait, in Z_5, the constants are 0,1,2,3,4. So that's 5 elements. But wait, in our space P, the polynomials can have degree up to 7, but the null space will only include those polynomials whose derivative is zero. So, the derivative of a constant is zero, and the derivative of any higher-degree term is non-zero unless the coefficient is zero.

Wait, actually, the derivative of a constant is zero, and any other term (like x^k for k >=1) when derived will have a non-zero coefficient, so only the constant polynomials are in the null space. So, the null space should consist of all constant polynomials. How many dimensions is that? Well, in the vector space P, each polynomial can be written as a linear combination of {1, x, x^2, ..., x^7}. So the basis has 8 elements, so the dimension of P is 8.

The null space N(D) is the set of all polynomials p where p'(x) = 0. As I thought, that's only the constants: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. So, the null space is a subspace of P consisting of 5 elements, but in terms of dimension, how many basis vectors? Well, since all constants are scalar multiples of 1, the null space is one-dimensional. So, the dimension n of the null space is 1.

Wait, but wait a second. In Z_5, the field has 5 elements, so the null space is a one-dimensional vector space because any non-zero scalar multiple of 1 gives a different constant. So, the nullity is 1.

Now, the range of D is the set of all possible derivatives p'(x) where p(x) is in P. Let's think about what p'(x) can be. The derivative of a degree 7 polynomial would be a degree 6 polynomial. So, the derivative reduces the degree by one, unless it's a constant, in which case the derivative is zero.

So, the range of D would consist of all polynomials of degree less than 7, right? Because the highest degree term in P is x^7, so its derivative is 7x^6. So, the range includes all polynomials of degree up to 6. But wait, are all such polynomials achievable by derivatives? Let me see.

Wait, if p(x) has a term x^k, then p'(x) has a term k x^{k-1}. So, for each term in p'(x), the coefficient is k times the coefficient of x^{k+1} in p(x). But in Z_5, the coefficients are modulo 5. So, for example, when k is 0, the derivative of x^0 (a constant) is zero. So, in the range, we can have any polynomial up to degree 6, but let's check if each coefficient can be achieved.

Wait, for each degree m in the range (from 0 to 6), can we find a p(x) such that p'(x) has any coefficient we want for x^m? Let's think for each m.

For m=6: The derivative of x^7 is 7x^6, which in Z_5 is 2x^6. So, if I have a coefficient a_7 in p(x) for x^7, then the coefficient for x^6 in p'(x) is 7a_7 mod 5, which is 2a_7. So, to get any coefficient b_6 in the range 0 to 4 for x^6 in p'(x), we can choose a_7 = (b_6) * (2^{-1} mod 5). Since 2*3=6≡1 mod5, the inverse of 2 is 3. So, a_7 = 3*b_6. Thus, any b_6 is possible.

Similarly, for m=5: The term in p'(x) comes from the x^6 term in p(x), which is 6a_6 x^5. 6 mod5 is 1, so the coefficient is a_6. So, to get any b_5, we can set a_6 = b_5. Thus, any b_5 is possible.

Similarly, for m=4: p'(x) has x^4 terms from x^5 in p(x). The coefficient is 5a_5, which mod5 is 0. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no: the x^5 term in p(x) is a_5 x^5, so its derivative is 5a_5 x^4. But 5 mod5 is 0, so the coefficient for x^4 in p'(x) is zero. Wait, that's a problem. So, can we get any coefficient for x^4 in the range?

Wait, no. Because the x^4 term in p'(x) can only come from the x^5 term in p(x), which gives zero, but also from the x^4 term in p(x) if it exists. Wait, no, wait: the derivative of x^4 is 4x^3, which would affect the x^3 term, not x^4. Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me correct this. Let me think about how each term in p'(x) is formed.

The x^m term in p'(x) comes from the x^{m+1} term in p(x) multiplied by (m+1). So, for m=6: x^7 in p(x) contributes 7a_7 x^6 → 2a_7 x^6 in Z_5.

For m=5: x^6 in p(x) contributes 6a_6 x^5 → a_6 x^5 in Z_5.

For m=4: x^5 in p(x) contributes 5a_5 x^4 → 0 x^4 in Z_5.

Wait, that's a problem. So, the coefficient for x^4 in p'(x) is zero, regardless of a_5. So, does that mean that the range of D doesn't include any x^4 term? That can't be right because when you have p(x) with x^5 term, the derivative would have a 5a_5 x^4 term, which is zero mod5. So, the x^4 term in p'(x) is always zero.

Wait, that's a problem because that would imply that the range of D is not all possible polynomials of degree up to 6. So, the range is missing the x^4 term. Hmm, that's a key point.

Wait, so this suggests that the range of D is not the entire space of polynomials of degree ≤6. Because the x^4 term can't be achieved through derivatives. So, the range is a subspace of polynomials of degree ≤6 where the coefficient of x^4 is zero.

So, how does that affect the dimension of the range?

Well, the full space of polynomials up to degree 6 has dimension 7 (since degrees 0 through 6 are 7 terms). But our range is missing the x^4 term, so the dimension would be 6? Or is there more to it?

Wait, no, because other terms might be affected. Let me think again.

Wait, the x^3 term in p'(x) comes from the x^4 term in p(x) with coefficient 4a_4. 4 mod5 is 4, which is non-zero, so a_4 can be chosen to get any coefficient for x^3.

Similarly, the x^2 term in p'(x) comes from the x^3 term in p(x) with coefficient 3a_3, which is 3 mod5, so non-zero. So, a_3 can be chosen to get any coefficient for x^2.

The x term in p'(x) comes from the x^2 term in p(x) with coefficient 2a_2. 2 mod5 is non-zero, so a_2 can be chosen to get any coefficient for x.

The constant term in p'(x) comes from the x term in p(x) with coefficient 1a_1. So, a_1 can be chosen to get any constant term.

Wait, but wait: the constant term in p'(x) is the coefficient of x in p(x), because the derivative of x is 1. So, if p(x) has an x term with coefficient a_1, then p'(x) has a constant term a_1.

So, the constant term in p'(x) can be any value in Z_5 by choosing a_1 appropriately.

So, the only term we can't get is the x^4 term. Because the x^5 term in p(x) contributes zero to x^4 in p'(x), and there's no other term in p(x) that can contribute to x^4 in p'(x). Because the x^4 term in p(x) would contribute 4a_4 x^3, not x^4.

So, the range of D is the set of all polynomials of degree ≤6 where the coefficient of x^4 is zero. So, the range has dimension 6 because in the space of polynomials up to x^6, we lose one dimension due to the missing x^4 term.

Wait, but wait, let me think about the basis. The range would consist of polynomials of the form:

a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 x^2 + a_3 x^3 + 0 x^4 + a_5 x^5 + a_6 x^6.

Wait, no, because when you take the derivative, the x^5 term in p(x) contributes 5a_5 x^4, which is zero in Z_5. So, the x^4 term in p'(x) is always zero. So, in the range, the x^4 coefficient is zero, but the other coefficients can vary.

So, the range is a subspace of polynomials of degree ≤6 where the coefficient of x^4 is zero. How many dimensions does that have?

Well, normally, the space of polynomials up to degree 6 has 7 dimensions (degrees 0 through 6). But in the range, one dimension is lost because x^4 is always zero. So, the range has dimension 6.

Wait, but wait, is that correct? Let me think again.

Another approach: The dimension of the range of D is equal to the rank of the linear transformation D.

The dimension of the domain P is 8, since degrees 0 through 7 make 8 terms.

By the Rank-Nullity Theorem, dim(domain) = dim(null space) + dim(range).

We've determined that dim(null space) is 1 (since only constants are in the null space). So, 8 = 1 + dim(range) → dim(range) =7.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the range was missing the x^4 term, which would imply dim(range)=6. But according to the Rank-Nullity Theorem, it should be 7.

Hmm, there's a contradiction here. So, where did I go wrong?

Wait, maybe my initial assumption that the range is missing the x^4 term is incorrect. Let me re-examine.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in thinking that the x^4 term can't be achieved. Let me think differently. Maybe I can find a polynomial p(x) whose derivative has a non-zero x^4 term.

Wait, no, because the derivative of x^5 is 5x^4, which is 0 in Z_5. So, any x^5 term in p(x) contributes nothing to the x^4 term in p'(x). So, the x^4 term in p'(x) can't be achieved by any term in p(x). Because:

- The x^4 term in p'(x) would come from the x^5 term in p(x), which gives 5a_5 x^4 → 0 in Z_5.

So, there's no way to get a non-zero x^4 term in p'(x). Therefore, the range of D cannot have any x^4 term, meaning that the range is a subspace of polynomials of degree ≤6 with the x^4 coefficient zero.

So, the dimension of the range would be 6, because in the 7-dimensional space of polynomials up to x^6, one dimension is missing (x^4).

But according to the Rank-Nullity Theorem, dim(range) should be 7 (since dim(null space) is 1, and 8=1+7). So, there's a contradiction here. That suggests that I made a mistake in my reasoning.

Wait, so perhaps my initial assumption about the null space is wrong. Let me check again.

The null space of D consists of all polynomials p(x) such that p'(x) = 0. That happens when all the coefficients of x^k for k ≥1 are zero, leaving only the constant term. So, the null space is indeed the set of constant polynomials, which form a one-dimensional subspace. So, n=1.

So, according to Rank-Nullity, r=8-1=7.

But earlier, I thought that the range is missing x^4, so dim(range)=6. But according to the theorem, it's 7. So, I must have made a mistake in evaluating the range.

Wait, perhaps the range is the entire space of polynomials of degree ≤6, except for the x^4 term being zero. But that would make it 6-dimensional, which contradicts the theorem.

So, where's the mistake? Let me think again.

Wait, maybe the x^4 term can be achieved through other terms. Let me think: can any x^4 term be present in p'(x)?

Wait, p'(x) is the derivative of p(x). Let me consider p(x) as a general polynomial:

p(x) = a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 x^2 + a_3 x^3 + a_4 x^4 + a_5 x^5 + a_6 x^6 + a_7 x^7.

Then, p'(x) = 0 + a_1 + 2 a_2 x + 3 a_3 x^2 + 4 a_4 x^3 + 5 a_5 x^4 + 6 a_6 x^5 +7 a_7 x^6.

Now, in Z_5, 5 a_5 x^4 becomes 0, 6 a_6 is equivalent to 1 a_6, and 7 a_7 is equivalent to 2 a_7.

So, p'(x) = a_1 + 2 a_2 x +3 a_3 x^2 +4 a_4 x^3 + 0 x^4 + a_6 x^5 + 2 a_7 x^6.

So, the x^4 term is always zero. So, the range of D is the set of all polynomials of degree ≤6 where the coefficient of x^4 is zero. Thus, the range is a subspace of dimension 6, because we're missing one basis vector (x^4).

But according to Rank-Nullity, the range should be 7-dimensional. So, where is the error here?

Wait a minute, perhaps I'm not considering that some other terms can contribute to x^4, but I don't think so. The x^4 term can only come from the x^5 term in p(x), which gives zero in Z_5.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the Rank-Nullity calculation. Let me check again.

Wait, the domain P has polynomials of degree ≤7, so the dimension is 8 (since it's a vector space with basis {1, x, x^2, ..., x^7}).

The null space N(D) consists of all constant polynomials, which form a 1-dimensional subspace. So, n=1.

Thus, by Rank-Nullity, dim(range) = 8 - 1 =7.

But from the expression of p'(x), the x^4 term is always zero, so the range is a subspace of polynomials of degree ≤6 with x^4 coefficient zero. But that subspace has dimension 6, not 7. So, this is a contradiction.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in thinking that the range is a subspace of polynomials of degree ≤6. Because, for example, the derivative of x^7 is 7x^6, which is 2x^6 in Z_5. So, the highest degree term in p'(x) can be x^6, which is degree 6. So, the range is indeed within polynomials of degree ≤6.

But if the range is missing the x^4 term, then it's 6-dimensional. But according to Rank-Nullity, it's 7-dimensional. So, something's wrong.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something in the structure of the range. Let me think about the possible coefficients.

Looking back at p'(x):

p'(x) = a_1 + 2 a_2 x +3 a_3 x^2 +4 a_4 x^3 + 0 x^4 + a_6 x^5 + 2 a_7 x^6.

So, the coefficients are:

- Constant term: a_1 (can be any of 0-4)
- x term: 2 a_2 (since 2 is invertible in Z_5, we can get any coefficient by choosing a_2 appropriately)
- x^2 term: 3 a_3 (3 is invertible)
- x^3 term:4 a_4 (4 is invertible)
- x^4 term: 0
- x^5 term: a_6
- x^6 term: 2 a_7

So, for each coefficient except x^4, we can choose a_i in p(x) to get any desired coefficient in p'(x). So, each of the coefficients except x^4 is free to vary. Therefore, the range has 7 dimensions because we have 7 degrees of freedom (x^0 to x^6, but x^4 is always zero). Wait, but that's 7 terms, but x^4 is fixed to zero, so the number of free variables is 6. Wait, that can't be right because according to Rank-Nullity, it's 7.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the x^4 term is not a free variable but is always zero. So, the number of free variables in the range is 6, which would mean the dimension is 6. But according to Rank-Nullity, it should be 7. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the dimensions. Let me list the coefficients that can vary in the range:

- Constant term (x^0): a_1 → 5 choices
- x term (x^1): 2a_2 → since 2 is invertible, a_2 can be any value, so 5 choices
- x^2 term:3a_3 → 5 choices
- x^3 term:4a_4 → 5 choices
- x^5 term: a_6 →5 choices
- x^6 term:2a_7 →5 choices

So, that's 6 coefficients that can be independently set, each with 5 possibilities. But according to the Rank-Nullity, the range should have dimension 7, so perhaps I'm missing a dimension.

Wait, perhaps I'm not accounting for the fact that the x^4 term is not the only one contributing to the dimension. Wait, no, because x^4 is always zero, so it's not part of the range. So, the range is a subspace of dimension 6 in the 7-dimensional space of polynomials up to x^6. But according to Rank-Nullity, it should be 7-dimensional.

This suggests that my earlier analysis must be wrong. So, where's the mistake?

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that the range is indeed the entire space of polynomials of degree ≤6, except for the x^4 term being zero. But that would mean the dimension is 6, which contradicts the Rank-Nullity. So, I must have made a mistake in the null space calculation.

Wait, perhaps the null space isn't just the constants. Let me think again. Are there any other polynomials whose derivative is zero? Well, in real analysis, only constants have zero derivatives. But in Z_5, is that the case?

Yes, because in any field, the derivative of a non-constant polynomial is non-zero. So, the null space is indeed just the constants, so n=1.

So, according to Rank-Nullity, r=7.

But according to the derivative's expression, the range is missing the x^4 term. So, the only way this makes sense is if the range is the entire space of polynomials up to degree 6, but that can't be because the x^4 term is always zero.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in how the coefficients contribute. Let me think again about the derivative.

Wait, perhaps I can get the x^4 term by using higher-degree terms in p(x). Let me see.

The derivative of x^5 is 5x^4, which is 0 in Z_5. The derivative of x^6 is 6x^5, which is 1x^5 in Z_5. The derivative of x^7 is 7x^6=2x^6 in Z_5.

Wait, so the x^4 term in p'(x) can't be achieved by any term in p(x). So, the range is missing the x^4 term, which would make its dimension 6.

But according to Rank-Nullity, it's 7. So, this is a contradiction, which suggests I must have made a mistake in the null space calculation.

Wait, maybe the null space is larger than I thought. Let me think again.

The null space is all polynomials p(x) where p'(x)=0. So, in the real numbers, only constants have zero derivatives. But in Z_5, is that still the case?

Yes. Let me consider p(x) = a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 x^2 + ... + a_7 x^7.

Then, p'(x) = a_1 + 2a_2 x + 3a_3 x^2 + 4a_4 x^3 + 5a_5 x^4 +6a_6 x^5 +7a_7 x^6.

In Z_5, 5a_5=0, 6a_6=1a_6, 7a_7=2a_7.

So, for p'(x) to be zero, all coefficients must be zero:

a_1 = 0,

2a_2=0 → a_2=0 (since 2 is invertible in Z_5),

3a_3=0 → a_3=0,

4a_4=0 → a_4=0,

5a_5=0 → a_5=0,

6a_6=0 → a_6=0,

7a_7=0 → 2a_7=0 → a_7=0.

So, the only polynomial in the null space is the constant polynomial a_0. So, the null space is indeed one-dimensional. So, n=1.

Thus, according to Rank-Nullity, r=7.

But according to the derivative's expression, the range is missing the x^4 term, which suggests r=6.

This is a problem. Where am I going wrong?

Wait, perhaps I'm miscounting the dimensions in the range. Let me think about the image of D.

The image of D is the set of all possible p'(x). From the expression above, the image consists of polynomials of the form:

b_0 + b_1 x + b_2 x^2 + b_3 x^3 + 0 x^4 + b_5 x^5 + b_6 x^6,

where:

b_0 = a_1,

b_1 = 2a_2,

b_2 =3a_3,

b_3=4a_4,

b_5=a_6,

b_6=2a_7.

Each of these coefficients can be chosen independently because the coefficients a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_6, a_7 can each be any element of Z_5. So, the image is a subspace of the space of polynomials up to degree 6 where the x^4 coefficient is zero.

How many dimensions does this subspace have? Well, the space of polynomials up to degree 6 has 7 dimensions. If one dimension is constrained (x^4=0), then the subspace's dimension is 6. But according to Rank-Nullity, it should be 7. So, I must have made a mistake in the reasoning.

Wait, perhaps I'm not considering that the image includes all polynomials of degree ≤6 except those with x^4 non-zero. But that can't be right because the image is exactly the set where x^4 is zero, which is a subspace of dimension 6.

So, this suggests that either my null space calculation is wrong, or my understanding of the derivative's image is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that the image is not a subspace where x^4 is zero, but something else. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe the x^4 term is not necessarily zero, but can be achieved through other means. Let me see.

Wait, no, because the only way to get an x^4 term in p'(x) is through the x^5 term in p(x), which contributes 5a_5 x^4, which is zero in Z_5. So, x^4 can't be achieved.

So, the image is a 6-dimensional subspace of the 7-dimensional space of polynomials up to degree 6. Therefore, the rank is 6, which contradicts the Rank-Nullity Theorem which suggests rank=7.

This is a problem. So, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the dimensions. Let me think differently.

Wait, perhaps the image is actually the entire space of polynomials up to degree 6, but the x^4 term is not constrained. But that can't be because, as we saw, the x^4 term in p'(x) is always zero.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in considering the degrees. Let me think: p(x) is of degree ≤7, so p'(x) is degree ≤6. But in the image, the x^4 term is zero. So, the image is a subspace of polynomials of degree ≤6, with x^4 coefficient zero. So, the dimension is 6.

But according to Rank-Nullity, it's 7. So, I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps the error is that the image is not missing the x^4 term. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I can construct a polynomial in the image that has a non-zero x^4 term. Wait, no, because as we saw, the x^4 term in p'(x) is always zero. So, the image cannot have any x^4 term.

So, the image is 6-dimensional. But according to the theorem, it should be 7. So, I must have made a mistake in the null space.

Wait, perhaps the null space isn't just the constants. Let me think again: in Z_5, are there any polynomials other than constants whose derivative is zero?

No, because the derivative of a polynomial is zero if and only if all its coefficients for x^k with k ≥1 are zero. So, the null space is indeed one-dimensional.

So, according to Rank-Nullity, the rank should be 7, but according to the derivative's image, it's 6. There must be a mistake in my analysis.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that in Z_5, the coefficient a_4 in p(x) contributes to the x^3 term in p'(x), but the x^4 term is not achieved. So, the image is indeed missing the x^4 term, making it 6-dimensional. But according to the theorem, it should be 7. So, perhaps I'm missing something in the way the coefficients contribute.

Wait, perhaps the image is not the subspace where x^4 is zero, but something else.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption about the image.

Wait, another approach: Let's model the derivative operator as a matrix and compute its rank.

The space P has dimension 8, with basis {1, x, x^2, x^3, x^4, x^5, x^6, x^7}.

The derivative operator D can be represented as a matrix where each basis vector is mapped to its derivative.

So, D(1) = 0,

D(x) = 1,

D(x^2) = 2x,

D(x^3) =3x^2,

D(x^4)=4x^3,

D(x^5)=5x^4=0,

D(x^6)=6x^5=1x^5,

D(x^7)=7x^6=2x^6.

So, the matrix of D with respect to the basis {1, x, x^2, x^3, x^4, x^5, x^6, x^7} is:

Row 1 (D(1)): 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Row 2 (D(x)): 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Row 3 (D(x^2)): 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0

Row 4 (D(x^3)): 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0

Row 5 (D(x^4)): 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0

Row 6 (D(x^5)): 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Row 7 (D(x^6)): 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0

Row 8 (D(x^7)): 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0

Wait, no, actually, each row represents the image of each basis vector as a column vector in the standard basis. So, perhaps it's better to write the matrix as columns representing the images.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the matrix as acting on the coefficient vector. So, for each basis vector e_i (which corresponds to x^{i-1}), D(e_i) is the derivative, which is (i-1) e_{i-1} if i>1, else zero.

So, the matrix would be an 8x8 matrix where:

- The first row (for D(1)) is all zeros.

- The second row (for D(x)) is [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0].

- The third row (for D(x^2)) is [0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0].

- The fourth row (for D(x^3)) is [0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0].

- The fifth row (for D(x^4)) is [0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0].

- The sixth row (for D(x^5)) is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] (since 5x^4=0).

- The seventh row (for D(x^6)) is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0] (since 6x^5=1x^5).

- The eighth row (for D(x^7)) is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0] (since 7x^6=2x^6).

So, the matrix looks like this:

Row 1: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Row 2: 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Row 3: 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0

Row 4: 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0

Row 5: 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0

Row 6: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Row 7: 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0

Row 8: 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0

Now, to find the rank of this matrix, we can perform row operations to see how many non-zero rows there are.

Looking at the matrix, the non-zero rows are rows 2,3,4,5,7,8. So, that's 6 non-zero rows. So, the rank of the matrix is 6. Therefore, the dimension of the range is 6, which contradicts the Rank-Nullity Theorem which suggests it should be 7.

Wait, but according to the matrix, the rank is 6, which would imply that the range has dimension 6, and the null space has dimension 2 (since 8-6=2), which contradicts our earlier conclusion that the null space is 1-dimensional.

This suggests that there's a mistake in either the matrix setup or the earlier reasoning.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in constructing the matrix. Let me double-check.

Wait, perhaps I should represent the matrix in terms of the images of each basis vector as columns, not rows. Because the standard way is to have the columns represent the images of each basis vector.

Wait, no, the standard matrix representation for a linear transformation has rows representing the basis vectors of the codomain. So, if the domain and codomain have the same basis, then each column represents the image of the corresponding basis vector.

Wait, perhaps I should represent the matrix as an 8x8 matrix where each column corresponds to the image of a basis vector.

Wait, but in the standard representation, the columns of the matrix are the images of the basis vectors expressed in terms of the codomain's basis.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused, but let me try to write the matrix correctly.

Each column corresponds to the image of a basis vector in the domain (P) expressed as a linear combination of the basis vectors in the codomain (also P, since D maps P to P).

So, for example:

- The first basis vector is 1. Its image under D is 0, so the first column is [0; 0; 0; 0; 0; 0; 0; 0].

- The second basis vector is x. Its image is 1, which is the first basis vector, so the second column is [1; 0; 0; 0; 0; 0; 0; 0].

- The third basis vector is x^2. Its image is 2x, which is 2 times the second basis vector, so the third column is [0; 2; 0; 0; 0; 0; 0; 0].

- The fourth basis vector is x^3. Its image is 3x^2 → third basis vector multiplied by 3 → [0; 0; 3; 0; 0; 0; 0; 0].

- The fifth basis vector is x^4. Its image is 4x^3 → fourth basis vector multiplied by 4 → [0; 0; 0; 4; 0; 0; 0; 0].

- The sixth basis vector is x^5. Its image is 0 → [0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0].

- The seventh basis vector is x^6. Its image is 1x^5 → sixth basis vector → [0;0;0;0;0;1;0;0].

- The eighth basis vector is x^7. Its image is 2x^6 → seventh basis vector multiplied by 2 → [0;0;0;0;0;0;2;0].

So, the matrix is an 8x8 matrix where:

Column 1: [0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0]

Column 2: [1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0]

Column 3: [0;2;0;0;0;0;0;0]

Column 4: [0;0;3;0;0;0;0;0]

Column 5: [0;0;0;4;0;0;0;0]

Column 6: [0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0]

Column 7: [0;0;0;0;0;1;0;0]

Column 8: [0;0;0;0;0;0;2;0]

Now, to find the rank of this matrix, we can look for the number of pivot positions in the row-echelon form.

Looking at the matrix, the non-zero rows are:

Row 2: 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Row 3: 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0

Row 4: 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0

Row 5: 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0

Row 7: 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0

Row 8: 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0

So, we have 6 non-zero rows, each with a leading 1 (or pivot) in distinct columns. Therefore, the rank of the matrix is 6.

This implies that the dimension of the range (rank) is 6, and the null space (kernel) has dimension 8-6=2.

But this contradicts our earlier conclusion that the null space is 1-dimensional. So, where is the mistake?

Wait, according to this matrix, the null space has dimension 2, which would mean that there are two linearly independent polynomials that are mapped to zero by D. But earlier, we thought that only constants are in the null space.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that in Z_5, the equation a_1=0, 2a_2=0, etc., allows for more solutions. Let me check.

In the matrix, the null space is the solution to D(p)=0, which corresponds to the equation Ap=0, where A is the matrix above.

The system of equations would be:

From column 1: 0*p1 =0 → always true.

From column 2: p2 =0.

From column 3: 2p3=0 → p3=0 (since 2 is invertible in Z_5).

From column 4:3p4=0 → p4=0.

From column5:4p5=0 → p5=0.

From column6: p6=0.

From column7: p7=0.

From column8: 2p8=0 → p8=0.

Wait, no, because the columns correspond to the images, so the null space is the set of p in P such that Ap=0. But I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of the null space as the set of vectors p = [p0, p1, p2, p3, p4, p5, p6, p7]^T such that Ap=0.

Looking at the matrix, the rows correspond to the basis vectors of the codomain. So, each row is the image of a basis vector in the domain.

Wait, perhaps I should set up the equations for Ap=0. Let me write the matrix and see.

The matrix A is:

Row 1: 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 → 0*p0 +1*p1 +0*p2 +0*p3 +0*p4 +0*p5 +0*p6 +0*p7 =0

Row 2: 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 → 0*p0 +0*p1 +2*p2 +0*p3 +0*p4 +0*p5 +0*p6 +0*p7 =0

Row 3: 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 → 0*p0 +0*p1 +0*p2 +3*p3 +0*p4 +0*p5 +0*p6 +0*p7 =0

Row 4: 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 → 0*p0 +0*p1 +0*p2 +0*p3 +4*p4 +0*p5 +0*p6 +0*p7 =0

Row 5: 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 → 0*p0 +0*p1 +0*p2 +0*p3 +0*p4 +0*p5 +1*p6 +0*p7 =0

Row 6: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 → 0*p0 +0*p1 +0*p2 +0*p3 +0*p4 +0*p5 +0*p6 +2*p7=0

So, the equations are:

1. p1 =0

2. 2p2=0 → p2=0

3. 3p3=0 → p3=0

4.4p4=0 → p4=0

5. p6=0

6.2p7=0 → p7=0

But what about p0 and p5? There are no equations involving p0 and p5. So, p0 and p5 can be any value in Z_5.

So, the general solution is:

p0 ∈ Z_5,

p1=0,

p2=0,

p3=0,

p4=0,

p5 ∈ Z_5,

p6=0,

p7=0.

So, the null space is all polynomials of the form p0 + p5 x^5.

Wait, that's interesting. So, the null space consists of polynomials that are constants plus multiples of x^5.

So, for example, 1 + 2x^5 is in the null space because its derivative is 0 + 2*5x^4 = 0 + 0x^4 =0.

So, the null space is two-dimensional, spanned by {1, x^5}.

So, n=2.

This contradicts my earlier conclusion that the null space was one-dimensional. So, where was I wrong?

Ah, I see now. In Z_5, the derivative of x^5 is 5x^4=0. So, any polynomial of the form a + b x^5 will have a derivative of 0, because the derivative of x^5 is zero, and the derivative of a constant is zero.

So, the null space is two-dimensional, spanned by 1 and x^5.

Therefore, n=2.

Then, according to the Rank-Nullity Theorem, the rank (dimension of the range) is 8-2=6.

So, the range has dimension 6.

So, the correct answer is n=2 and r=6.

Looking at the options, option I is n=2 and r=6.

The problem involves determining the dimensions of the null space (n) and range (r) of the derivative operator \( D \) on the vector space \( P \) of polynomials with coefficients in \( \mathbb{Z}_5 \) and degree at most 7. 

### Null Space Analysis
The null space of \( D \), denoted \( \text{Null}(D) \), consists of all polynomials \( p(x) \) such that \( D(p(x)) = 0 \). The derivative of a polynomial is zero if and only if all coefficients of \( x^k \) for \( k \geq 1 \) are zero. In \( \mathbb{Z}_5 \), this means the null space includes polynomials of the form \( a_0 + a_5 x^5 \), where \( a_0, a_5 \in \mathbb{Z}_5 \). These polynomials are mapped to zero because the derivative of \( x^5 \) is \( 5x^4 = 0 \) in \( \mathbb{Z}_5 \). Thus, the null space is spanned by \( \{1, x^5\} \), making it **two-dimensional** (\( n = 2 \)).

### Range Analysis
The range of \( D \), denoted \( \text{Range}(D) \), consists of all possible derivatives \( p'(x) \) of polynomials \( p(x) \in P \). The derivative of a polynomial of degree at most 7 is a polynomial of degree at most 6. However, the coefficient of \( x^4 \) in \( p'(x) \) is always zero because it arises from the \( x^5 \) term in \( p(x) \), which contributes \( 5a_5 x^4 = 0 \) in \( \mathbb{Z}_5 \). Therefore, the range is a subspace of polynomials of degree at most 6 with the \( x^4 \) coefficient fixed to zero. This subspace has **six dimensions** (\( r = 6 \)).

### Conclusion
Using the Rank-Nullity Theorem, which states that \( \dim(P) = \dim(\text{Null}(D)) + \dim(\text{Range}(D)) \), we confirm that:
\[
8 = 2 + 6
\]
Thus, the dimensions of the null space and range are \( n = 2 \) and \( r = 6 \), respectively.
