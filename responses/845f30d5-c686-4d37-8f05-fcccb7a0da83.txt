Okay, so I need to find the de Broglie wavelength of an electron with a kinetic energy of 100 eV. Hmm, I remember that the de Broglie wavelength formula is lambda = h / p, where h is Planck's constant and p is the momentum of the electron. But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact steps here. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I need to find the momentum p. Oh right, because p = mv, but I don't have the velocity. So I guess I need to find the velocity from the kinetic energy. The kinetic energy (KE) is given as 100 eV, which I should convert into joules because standard units are in SI.

So, 1 eV is 1.602 × 10^-19 joules. Therefore, 100 eV would be 100 * 1.602e-19 J, which is 1.602e-17 J. Got that part.

Now, the kinetic energy for non-relativistic speeds is (1/2)mv². So I can solve for v. Let me write that equation: KE = (1/2)mv². Rearranging, v = sqrt( (2 KE) / m ). But wait, I have the mass of the electron given as 9.11 × 10^-28 grams. Oh, I need to convert that into kilograms because SI units are in kg. So 9.11e-28 g is 9.11e-31 kg, right? Because 1 g is 1e-3 kg, so 1e-28 g is 1e-31 kg. So m = 9.11e-31 kg.

Putting the numbers in: KE is 1.602e-17 J. So 2 * KE is 3.204e-17. Divide that by m: 3.204e-17 / 9.11e-31. Let me calculate that. 3.204e-17 / 9.11e-31 is approximately (3.204 /9.11) * 1e14. 3.204 ÷9.11 is about 0.3516. So 0.3516e14 is 3.516e13. Then take the square root of that to get v. So sqrt(3.516e13) = about 5.93e6 m/s. Wait, that seems a bit slow for an electron, but maybe it's okay because 100 eV isn't that high in energy.

Now that I have the velocity, I can find the momentum p = mv. So m is 9.11e-31 kg, v is 5.93e6 m/s. Multiplying them: 9.11e-31 *5.93e6. Let's compute that: 9.11 *5.93 ≈ 54.18, and 1e-31 *1e6 =1e-25. So p ≈54.18e-25 kg·m/s, which is 5.418e-24 kg·m/s.

Wait, maybe there's a better way to calculate p without finding v first. Oh right, because KE = p²/(2m). So rearranging, p = sqrt(2m KE). Let's try that. m =9.11e-31 kg, KE=1.602e-17 J. So 2m KE is 2*9.11e-31 *1.602e-17 = let's compute that. 2*9.11 is 18.22, so 18.22e-31 *1.602e-17. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 2 *9.11e-31 kg is 1.822e-30 kg. Then multiply by 1.602e-17 J. So 1.822e-30 *1.602e-17 = (1.822 *1.602) *1e-47. 1.822 *1.602 is approximately 2.918. So 2.918e-47. Then p = sqrt(2.918e-47) kg²·m²/s². Taking the square root gives sqrt(2.918e-47) ≈ 5.402e-24 kg·m/s. Okay, that matches what I got earlier with the velocity method. So p is about 5.40e-24 kg·m/s.

Now, Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626e-34 J·s. So the de Broglie wavelength lambda = h / p = 6.626e-34 / 5.40e-24. Let me compute that: 6.626e-34 /5.40e-24 = (6.626/5.40) *1e-10. 6.626 /5.40 is approximately 1.227. So 1.227e-10 meters. Converting that to angstroms since the options are in Å. 1e-10 meters is 1 Å, so 1.227e-10 m is 1.227 Å. Looking at the options, option G is 1.226 Å, which is very close. So the answer should be G.

To determine the de Broglie wavelength of an electron with a kinetic energy of 100 eV, we use the formula:

\[
\lambda = \frac{h}{p}
\]

where \( h \) is Planck's constant (\( 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \)) and \( p \) is the momentum of the electron. The momentum \( p \) can be calculated using the kinetic energy \( KE \) and the mass \( m \) of the electron:

\[
p = \sqrt{2m \cdot KE}
\]

The kinetic energy is given as \( 100 \, \text{eV} \), which is converted to joules:

\[
100 \, \text{eV} = 100 \times 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} = 1.602 \times 10^{-17} \, \text{J}
\]

The mass of the electron is \( 9.11 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg} \). Substituting into the momentum formula:

\[
p = \sqrt{2 \cdot (9.11 \times 10^{-31}) \cdot (1.602 \times 10^{-17})}
\]

\[
p = \sqrt{2.918 \times 10^{-47}} \approx 5.402 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{kg·m/s}
\]

Now, calculate the de Broglie wavelength:

\[
\lambda = \frac{6.626 \times 10^{-34}}{5.402 \times 10^{-24}} \approx 1.227 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m}
\]

Convert to angstroms (\( 1 \, \text{Å} = 1 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \)):

\[
\lambda \approx 1.227 \, \text{Å}
\]

Comparing with the options, the closest value is **G: 1.226 Å**.
