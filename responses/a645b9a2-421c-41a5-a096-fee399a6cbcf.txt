Okay, let's try to figure out this problem step by step. So, the question is about comparing the speed to price ratio of current and older computers. Hmm, ratios can sometimes be tricky, but let's break it down.

First, the problem says that five years ago, a computer worked half as fast as a current computer and cost twice as much. So, let's assign some variables to make it clearer. Let me think: let's say the current computer's speed is S, and its price is P. That makes sense.

Five years ago, the computer's speed was half of the current one, so that would be 0.5S. And the price back then was twice as much as now, so that's 2P. Got it.

Now, the speed to price ratio for the current computer is S divided by P, right? So that's S/P. For the older computer, it's (0.5S) divided by (2P). Let me write that out: (0.5S)/(2P).

Wait, let me compute that. 0.5 divided by 2 is 0.25, so the ratio for the older computer is 0.25 * (S/P). Because S/P is the current ratio, let's call that R_current. So the older ratio is 0.25 * R_current.

Wait no, wait. Wait, the older computer's ratio is (0.5S)/(2P). Let me compute that: 0.5/2 is 0.25, so it's 0.25*(S/P). So the older ratio is 0.25 times the current ratio.

But the question is asking what percent the current ratio is of the older one. So we need to find (current ratio) / (older ratio) * 100%.

So R_current is S/P, and R_old is (0.5S)/(2P) = (0.5/2)*(S/P) = 0.25*(S/P). So R_old = 0.25 * R_current.

So when we take R_current divided by R_old, that's R_current / (0.25*R_current) = 1 / 0.25 = 4. So that's 4 times. To get the percentage, we multiply by 100%, so 4 * 100 = 400%.

Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Current computer: speed S, price P. So speed/price = S/P.

Old computer: speed 0.5S, price 2P. So speed/price = 0.5S / 2P = (0.5/2)*(S/P) = 0.25*(S/P). So yes, R_old is 0.25 times R_current.

So R_current is 4 times R_old. So the current ratio is 400% of the older ratio. So the answer should be 400%, which is option E.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up the ratios. The question asks what percent the current ratio is of the older one. So current is S/P, older is 0.25*(S/P). So current is 4 times older, so 400% of the older's ratio. Yep, that's correct.

The current computer's speed-to-price ratio is 400% of the older computer's ratio.
