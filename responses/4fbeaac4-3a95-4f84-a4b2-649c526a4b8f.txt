Okay, I need to answer this multiple-choice question about the hydrologic cycle. The question is asking during which process water molecules absorb energy. The options are from A to J. Let me think through each one to figure out which process involves water absorbing energy.

First, I remember that in the hydrologic cycle, energy plays a big role, especially in processes like evaporation. Water absorbs energy to change its state, right? So processes that involve turning liquid water into vapor, or solid to liquid, those require energy absorption.

Let's go through each option:

A: Water seeping into groundwater reservoirs. That's more about infiltration. Water is moving from the surface into the ground. I don't think much energy absorption happens here; it's more about movement.

B: Absorption of rainwater by the soil. When rainwater is absorbed by the soil, it's more about infiltration and maybe percolation. But absorption here refers to the water being taken in, not necessarily the energy aspect. Unless it's about the energy to move into the soil, but I'm not sure. Maybe not the main process where energy is absorbed by the water molecules.

C: Formation of a cloud from water vapor. Clouds form when water vapor condenses into tiny droplets. That process releases energy because condensation is exothermic. So in this case, water molecules are releasing energy, not absorbing it. So C is probably not the right answer.

D: Formation of dew from water vapor. Dew forms when water vapor condenses on surfaces. Again, condensation releases energy, so the water molecules are giving off energy, not absorbing. So D is not the answer.

E: Water flow in rivers and streams. Flowing water involves kinetic energy, but the water molecules aren't necessarily absorbing energy here. It's more about movement. So E might not be the right choice.

F: Formation of snow from water vapor. Snow forms when water vapor sublimates into ice crystals. Sublimation requires energy because it's going from vapor to solid. Wait, noâ€”sublimation is when solid turns directly into vapor, but here it's forming snow, which is solid from vapor. That would actually be deposition, which is a phase change that requires energy. So the water vapor is absorbing energy to form snow? Wait, no, when vapor forms into snow, it's actually releasing energy because it's condensing. Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Wait, when water vapor forms into snow, it's condensing into ice. Condensation usually releases energy because the molecules are going from a higher energy state (gas) to a lower one (liquid or solid). So when forming snow, water vapor condenses into ice, which releases energy. So the molecules are giving off energy, not absorbing. So F might not be the right answer.

G: Formation of ice from water. Ice forms when water freezes. Freezing is when liquid turns into solid. This process releases energy because the molecules slow down and release heat. So again, energy is being released, not absorbed. So G is not correct.

H: Runoff along the land surface. Runoff is when water flows over land, similar to E. It's about movement, so the water isn't absorbing energy in this process. So H isn't the answer.

I: Evaporation from the ocean surface. Evaporation is when water turns from liquid to vapor. This process requires energy because the molecules need to overcome intermolecular forces. So the water absorbs energy from the surrounding, like the sun's heat. So I is a strong candidate because evaporation involves water molecules absorbing energy.

J: Formation of fog from water vapor. Fog forms when water vapor condenses into tiny droplets. As with clouds, condensation releases energy. So J is not the right answer.

So reviewing, the correct process where water molecules absorb energy is evaporation. So option I is the answer.

The process where water molecules absorb energy is evaporation, as it requires energy for water to transition from liquid to vapor.
