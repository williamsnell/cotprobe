Question:

A listener-sponsored radio station wants to estimate the amount of money the typical supporter contributes during a fund-drive. In a sample of 30 supporters, it was discovered that 22 of them gave $60, six of them gave $1,000, and two of them gave $10,000. Based on this sample, which of the following measures of central tendency would provide the most useful information to the radio station?

Options:

A: Range
B: Variance
C: Standard Deviation
D: Median
E: Frequency Distribution
F: Histogram
G: Quartiles
H: Mode
I: ANOVA
J: Mean

Okay, so I've got this question about statistics, specifically about measures of central tendency. Let me try to break it down. The question is about a radio station that wants to estimate the typical contribution from supporters during a fund drive. They took a sample of 30 supporters and found that 22 gave $60, six gave $1,000, and two gave $10,000. Now, they're asking which measure would be most useful for them.

First, I need to remember what each of these statistical measures means. The options are Range, Variance, Standard Deviation, Median, Frequency Distribution, Histogram, Quartiles, Mode, ANOVA, and Mean. Let's go through them one by one.

The question is about central tendency, so that should narrow it down. Central tendency measures the center of the data, so we're looking at Mean, Median, Mode, or possibly others. The other options like Range, Variance, Standard Deviation are measures of spread, not central tendency. Frequency Distribution and Histogram are graphical representations, not measures of center. ANOVA is for comparing means across groups, which doesn't apply here since there's only one sample.

So the main contenders are Mean, Median, and Mode, along with possibly Quartiles and others. Let me think about the data provided. There are 30 supporters: 22 gave $60, which is the majority, 6 gave $1,000, and 2 gave $10,000. So the data is skewed because a few people gave a lot more than the majority.

If I calculate the Mean, that would be the average contribution. So (22*60 + 6*1000 + 2*10000)/30. Let me do that quickly: 22*60 is 1320, 6*1000 is 6000, 2*10000 is 20000. Adding those up: 1320 + 6000 = 7320, plus 20000 is 27320. Divided by 30, that's about 910.67. So the Mean is around $910.

The Median would be the middle value when the data is ordered. Since there are 30 data points, the median would be the average of the 15th and 16th values. Let's list the data in order: 22 times $60, then 6 times $1000, then 2 times $10000. So the first 22 are $60, then the next 6 are $1000, and the last two are $10000. So the 15th and 16th are both $60. Therefore, the Median is $60.

The Mode is the most frequent value, which is $60, since 22 people gave that amount.

The question is which measure is most useful. The radio station wants to estimate the typical supporter's contribution. If they use the Mean, it's around $910, but that's influenced heavily by the two people who gave $10,000. The Median is $60, which is the middle value, not affected by those high amounts. The Mode is also $60.

So, which one is more useful? Well, the Mean can be skewed by those high values, making it seem like the average is much higher than it actually is for most people. The Median and Mode both show that the typical contribution is around $60. 

But wait, the question is about the "typical supporter." The Mean might not be the best because it's pulled up by the outliers. The Median is better in this case because it's resistant to outliers. However, the Mode is also $60, which is the most common contribution. So both Median and Mode are $60. But in terms of central tendency measures, the Median is often preferred when there are outliers because it's not affected by them, whereas the Mean is.

So looking at the options provided, the choices are D: Median and H: Mode. Both are correct, but the question is asking for the most useful. Since the data is skewed, the Median would give a better representation of the typical supporter's contribution. The Mean would be misleading because of the two high donations.

Wait, but the question is about a listener-sponsored radio station trying to estimate the "typical" contribution. So if they want to know what most people are giving, the Mode is $60, which is what 22 out of 30 people gave. The Median is also $60. So both are the same here. But which is more useful? Well, in some cases, the Median is preferred because it's less affected by extremes, but in this case, both are the same. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps they're asking for which measure is most appropriate. Since the data is skewed, the Median is the best measure of central tendency. The Mean would give a higher value, which isn't typical for most supporters. So the correct answer would be the Median, which is D. Alternatively, the Mode is also correct, but the question is about central tendency, and both Median and Mode are measures of that.

Wait, but the options don't have both. Let me check the options again. The options are A to J, including D: Median and H: Mode. So both are possible. But in the data given, the Median is $60, and the Mode is also $60. So both would indicate that the typical contribution is $60. However, the question is about which measure would provide the most useful information. Since both are correct, but perhaps the Median is more commonly used as a central tendency measure when dealing with skewed distributions. So I think the answer is D: Median.

The question involves determining the most useful measure of central tendency for a radio station to estimate the typical contribution from supporters. The data shows that 22 supporters gave $60, 6 gave $1,000, and 2 gave $10,000. 

Analyzing the options, measures like Range, Variance, Standard Deviation, Frequency Distribution, Histogram, Quartiles, and ANOVA are not central tendency measures. This leaves Mean, Median, and Mode as potential answers. 

- **Mean**: Calculated as approximately $910, it is skewed by the two high donations of $10,000. 
- **Median**: The middle value, which is $60, as the 15th and 16th values in the ordered data are both $60. 
- **Mode**: The most frequent value, which is $60, as 22 supporters gave this amount. 

Both the Median and Mode indicate that the typical contribution is $60, but the Median is often preferred in skewed distributions because it is less affected by outliers. Therefore, the most useful measure is the Median.

Answer: D
