Okay, so I have this question about employment testing and how certain concerns have influenced the types of tests used. Let me try to break this down.

The question is about the principal effect of a current concern aimed at improving employment opportunities for those who are educationally or socially disadvantaged. The focus is on what kind of tests are encouraged in employment settings because of this concern.

First, I need to understand the context. The concern is about helping the disadvantaged, so the goal is probably to make employment testing fairer or more inclusive. Maybe the idea is to find ways that don't penalize people for their background but still assess relevant skills.

Looking at the options:

A: Intelligence quotient tests (IQ tests) measure general intelligence. But I remember that IQ tests can have cultural biases and might not reflect on job performance as much as other factors. Using them could disadvantage some groups, so maybe this isn't the answer.

B: Norm-referenced tests compare individuals against a norm group. These are often standardized tests where you're ranked relative to others. But if the concern is about helping the disadvantaged, maybe these aren't the best because they could reinforce existing inequalities if the disadvantaged aren't part of the norm group.

C: Tests that assess physical abilities. These would be relevant for jobs that require physical strength, but not all jobs are physical. Plus, this might not address educational or social disadvantages directly.

D: Work-sample types of tests. These tests simulate actual job tasks. They assess how well someone can perform specific job-related tasks. I think these are more job-specific and might be less biased because they focus on what you can do rather than prior knowledge or innate abilities. This could help people who are disadvantaged by not relying on academic background.

E: Timed tests of a narrow range of abilities. These might favor those who are faster or have better test-taking skills, which could be an issue for the disadvantaged. Also, a narrow range might not capture all necessary skills for a role.

F: Personality assessment tests. These look at traits and could be useful, but they might not directly measure job-related skills. Also, personality tests can be subjective and might not address the main issue of improving employment opportunities for the disadvantaged.

G: Tests based solely on academic performance. These would disadvantage those with less education, which is the opposite of what we want. So this is unlikely to be the answer.

H: Tests based on social skills. While important, not all jobs require the same level of social skills, and this might not address the broader issue of employment opportunities for the disadvantaged.

Putting it together, the concern is about improving opportunities for the educationally or socially disadvantaged. Work-sample tests (option D) seem to align because they focus on actual job tasks, which can be learned and are less dependent on prior education or social background. They're more about what you can do in the job rather than what you already know, which could help level the playing field.

The principal effect of the concern to improve employment opportunities for the educationally or socially disadvantaged has been to encourage the use of work-sample types of tests in employment testing. These tests assess job-related tasks and skills, focusing on what individuals can do rather than their prior knowledge or background, which helps level the playing field.
