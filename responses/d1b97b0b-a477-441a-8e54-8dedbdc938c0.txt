Question:

An 18-year-old primigravid woman comes for her initial prenatal visit at 16 weeks' gestation. She is not sure about the date of her last menstrual period but says that the pregnancy probably occurred immediately after she stopped taking oral contraceptives 5 months ago. Maternal serum α-fetoprotein (MSAFP) concentration is increased to 3 multiples of the median. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?

Options:

A: Amniocentesis for measurement of α-fetoprotein concentration
B: Immediate cesarean section
C: Hormone therapy to balance MSAFP levels
D: Monitor patient without taking action
E: Triple screening for MSAFP, serum β-hCG, and serum estriol concentrations
F: Administer a pregnancy test
G: Prescribe oral contraceptives
H: Ultrasonography
I: Repeat measurement of MSAFP concentration
J: Conduct a pelvic exam

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the next step in managing this patient's case. Let's break down the information given.

The patient is an 18-year-old primigravid woman, meaning it's her first pregnancy. She came for her initial prenatal visit at 16 weeks' gestation. She's unsure about the date of her last menstrual period (LMP), but she thinks the pregnancy happened right after she stopped taking oral contraceptives five months ago. So, she probably got pregnant as soon as she stopped the pills.

Her MSAFP (maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein) concentration is increased to 3 multiples of the median. I remember that MSAFP is a marker used in prenatal screening. Elevated levels can indicate certain conditions like neural tube defects or chromosomal abnormalities.

Now, the options are A through J. Let me go through each one.

Option A: Amniocentesis for α-fetoprotein concentration. Wait, MSAFP is already elevated. If they do amniocentesis, they can measure the amniotic fluid α-fetoprotein. If the amniotic level is also high, that might suggest a neural tube defect because the fetus would produce more AFP. But I'm not sure if this is the immediate next step or if there's another test first.

Option B: Immediate cesarean section. That seems drastic. I don't think elevated MSAFP alone warrants an immediate C-section. It's more about diagnostic tests rather than an intervention right away.

Option C: Hormone therapy to balance MSAFP levels. I don't recall any standard treatment for elevated MSAFP. It's usually a screening marker, not something you treat. So probably not C.

Option D: Monitor without action. Maybe, but given it's elevated, I think further testing is needed before just monitoring. But I'm not certain.

Option E: Triple screening. The triple screen includes MSAFP, hCG, and estriol. But she already has MSAFP, so maybe they would do more in the triple screen? Or perhaps they did the triple screen already and found the elevated AFP.

Option F: Administer a pregnancy test. She's already pregnant, so that's probably not necessary.

Option G: Prescribe oral contraceptives. She's already pregnant, so that's irrelevant.

Option H: Ultrasonography. Ultrasound is often the next step when there's an abnormal MSAFP. It can help determine gestational age, confirm the pregnancy location, and look for structural abnormalities. Maybe this is a good option.

Option I: Repeat MSAFP measurement. Sometimes lab errors happen, but if it's consistently high, a repeat might not change the management plan much. Maybe not the first step unless it's a borderline value.

Option J: Conduct a pelvic exam. She's 16 weeks along; a pelvic exam might not show much beyond what's already known. Not the most informative next step.

So, putting it together: Elevated MSAFP can be due to various factors, including multiple pregnancies, fetal abnormalities, or maternal factors. The first line after an abnormal MSAFP is usually an ultrasound to confirm the gestational age, check for multiple fetuses, and assess for any structural issues. If the ultrasound shows an anomaly, then amniocentesis might be considered for karyotyping or AFP levels.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step is likely an ultrasound (option H). It helps clarify the situation before any invasive tests like amniocentesis.

The patient is an 18-year-old primigravid woman with an elevated MSAFP level of 3 multiples of the median. The appropriate next step is to perform an ultrasonography to confirm gestational age, rule out multiple pregnancies, and assess for structural abnormalities. 

Answer: H
