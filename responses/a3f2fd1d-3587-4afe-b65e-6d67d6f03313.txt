Okay, so I have this question about how many cups of coffee were consumed in the United States in the past week as of 2013. The options are from A to J, and I need to pick the correct one. Let me think about this step by step.

First, I know that coffee is a widely consumed beverage in the U.S. I've heard numbers before, but I'm not exactly sure of the exact figure. I remember reading somewhere that the consumption is quite high, but I'm not sure if it's in the billions or millions of cups per week.

Let me try to break it down. The U.S. population is over 300 million people. If I assume that a significant portion of the population drinks coffee regularly, maybe even multiple cups a day, the numbers could add up quickly. For example, if 200 million people drink an average of 2 cups a day, that's 400 million cups per day. Over a week, that would be 2.8 billion cups. But wait, that's just an estimate, and I'm not sure if the actual number is higher.

I think coffee consumption in the U.S. is among the highest in the world. I recall seeing statistics that the U.S. is one of the top consumers of coffee globally. Maybe around 3-4 billion cups per week? Let me think about the options given.

Looking at the options: A is 9 billion, B is 3 billion, C is 10 billion, D is 2 billion, E is 6 billion, F is 300 million, G is 500 million, H is 4 billion, I is 1 billion, J is 5 billion.

So, the options range from 1 billion up to 10 billion. I'm thinking that 3 billion seems a bit low because if each of the 300 million people drinks just one cup a week, that's 300 million, which is option F. But obviously, people drink more than that. Maybe 3 billion cups per week is too low.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the daily consumption and multiply by 7. If the daily consumption is around 400 million cups, then weekly would be 2.8 billion, which is close to option H (4 billion) or maybe E (6 billion). But I'm not sure if that's accurate.

I remember reading that in 2013, the U.S. consumed around 400 million cups of coffee per day. If that's the case, then over a week, that would be 400 million multiplied by 7, which is 2.8 billion. But none of the options exactly match 2.8 billion. The closest options are H (4 billion) and E (6 billion). Hmm, maybe my initial assumption about daily consumption is off.

Alternatively, perhaps it's higher. Maybe the daily consumption is closer to 500 million cups. 500 million times 7 is 3.5 billion, which is still not matching any options precisely. The options given are A:9B, B:3B, C:10B, D:2B, E:6B, F:0.3B, G:0.5B, H:4B, I:1B, J:5B.

Wait, another approach: I think the total annual coffee consumption in the U.S. is about 400 million pounds per year. If I can find out how many cups that equates to, then I can divide by 52 weeks to get weekly consumption. But I'm not sure about the exact conversion from pounds to cups. Let me think: 1 pound of coffee is roughly 16 cups (since 1 cup is about 8 ounces, and a pound is 16 ounces). So 400 million pounds would be 400 million * 16 = 6.4 billion cups per year. Divided by 52 weeks, that's about 123 million cups per week. That seems low, but wait, that can't be right because that's only 123 million cups a week, which is much lower than the options given.

Wait, maybe I messed up the conversion. Let me check: 1 pound of coffee beans yields approximately 16 cups of brewed coffee. So 400 million pounds would be 400 million * 16 = 6.4 billion cups annually. Divided by 52 weeks, that's roughly 123 million cups per week. But that's way lower than the options. So I must be missing something.

Alternatively, maybe the annual consumption is higher. I think the actual number is higher than 400 million pounds. Maybe around 600 million pounds annually? That would make 600 million *16 =9.6 billion cups per year, which is about 185 million cups per week. Still not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing pounds with another unit. Let me think differently. Maybe the statistic is given in cups per day. I've heard that Americans drink about 400 million cups of coffee each day. If that's the case, then per week it's 400 million *7 =2.8 billion cups. Looking back at the options, option E is 6 billion, which is higher. Option H is 4 billion, which is lower. Hmm, 2.8 isn't an option, but perhaps the actual figure is a bit higher.

Alternatively, maybe the figure includes both at-home and away-from-home consumption. I think that data might include all types, so perhaps the number is higher than 400 million per day. Maybe around 450 million cups per day. 450 million *7 is 3.15 billion, which is still not matching any option exactly. The closest is option E (6B) and H (4B). Wait, perhaps the options are in billions, so 3.15 billion would round to 3 billion, which is option B. But I'm not sure if that's accurate.

Wait, another thought: maybe the question is about the past week, so it's weekly consumption, not annual. But I'm not certain about the exact figure. I think I've heard that the U.S. consumes around 400 million cups per day, which would make weekly around 2.8 billion. Since that's not an option, perhaps the closest is option E (6B) which is higher, but I don't think it's that high. Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is option B: 3 billion, which is close to 2.8.

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident. Another angle: I've heard that in 2013, the U.S. consumed about 146 billion cups of coffee annually. If I divide that by 52 weeks, that's roughly 2.8 billion per week. Again, not matching any option exactly. But the closest is option H:4 billion, which is higher. Alternatively, maybe the number is higher. Let me see: 146 billion cups per year is about 2.8 billion per week. So none of the options match exactly. But perhaps the actual number is higher.

Wait, maybe I'm using the wrong annual figure. Let me check: according to some sources, the U.S. consumes about 400 million cups of coffee every day. So 400 million *7 =2.8 billion per week. But that's not an option. The options are A:9B, B:3B, C:10B, D:2B, E:6B, F:0.3B, G:0.5B, H:4B, I:1B, J:5B.

So 2.8B is closest to option E (6B) is too high, H (4B) is higher than that, but B (3B) is lower. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option E:6B, but that seems too high. Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is option J:5B. Wait, but I'm not sure.

Another approach: I think the correct answer is around 3 billion cups per week. That would make sense because 400 million per day is about 2.8B per week, which is close to 3B. So option B (3B) could be the answer. Alternatively, maybe the figure is higher because it includes all forms, like espresso, cappuccino, etc., not just brewed coffee.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to recall any specific statistics. I think the number is around 400 million cups per day, which is 2.8B per week. Since that's not an option, perhaps the closest is option B:3B. Alternatively, maybe the actual figure is higher. Let me think: if each of the 300 million people drinks 1 cup a day, that's 300 million per day, which is 2.1B per week. That's even lower than 2.8B. But people drink more than one cup, so maybe 2.8B is a better estimate.

But since 2.8B isn't an option, perhaps the correct answer is option E:6B. Wait, that seems too high. Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is option J:5B. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the data includes both at-home and away-from-home consumption. Maybe the total is higher. Let me think: if 400 million is just at-home, then away-from-home could add another 100 million, making it 500 million per day. That would be 3.5B per week, which is still not an option. Alternatively, maybe the figure is higher.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option E:6B. But I'm not sure. Wait, another thought: I think the correct answer is option E:6B. Because I've heard that the U.S. consumes about 6 billion cups of coffee per week. But I'm not entirely certain.

Wait, let me think again. If 400 million cups per day is accurate, then weekly is 2.8B. But perhaps the actual number is higher. Maybe 500 million per day, which would be 3.5B per week. Again, not matching any option. Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is option E:6B, but I'm not confident.

Wait, I think I've read that the U.S. consumes about 400 million cups per day, which is about 2.8B per week. Since that's not an option, perhaps the closest is option B:3B. Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is option E:6B, but that seems too high.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the past week in 2013, so maybe the figure is 3 billion cups. I think I've heard that number before. So option B:3B.
</think>

The question asks about the number of cups of coffee consumed in the United States in the past week as of 2013. Considering the options provided and the reasoning, the most plausible answer is **B: 3 billion cups per week**. This aligns with estimates of around 400 million cups per day, which translates to approximately 2.8 billion cups weekly. Since 2.8 billion isn't an option, the closest match is 3 billion.

Answer: B
