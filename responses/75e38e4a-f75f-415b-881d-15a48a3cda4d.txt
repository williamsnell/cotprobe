Alright, so I've got this logic problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try my best. Let me break it down step by step.

The proposition given is: (∀x) {Ax ⊃ (∀y)[(Hy • Ly) ⊃ ∼Bxy]}

First, I need to understand each part of this. The translation key is provided, so let's parse it.

Ax means "x is an apartment." So, whenever we see Ax, it's about an apartment.

Hy is "y is a house," and Ly is "y is large." So, (Hy • Ly) is "y is a large house."

Bxy is "x is bigger than y." The negation, ∼Bxy, would then mean "x is not bigger than y," or "y is not smaller than x," but I think it's clearer to stick with "x is not bigger than y."

Now, the entire formula is a universal statement: for all x, if x is an apartment, then for all y, if y is a large house, then x is not bigger than y.

So, putting it into English, it's saying: For every x, if x is an apartment, then for every y, if y is a large house, y is not smaller than x. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again.

Wait, the structure is ∀x (Ax → ∀y [(Hy ∧ Ly) → ¬Bxy]). So, for any x, if x is an apartment, then for any y, if y is a large house, then x is not bigger than y. So, x (an apartment) is not bigger than any y that is a large house.

Hmm, that's a bit tricky. Alternatively, it's saying that every apartment is not bigger than every large house. So, no apartment is bigger than any large house.

Wait, that makes sense. So, for any apartment x, and any large house y, x is not bigger than y. So, no apartment is bigger than any large house. So, every large house is bigger than every apartment. Or, equivalently, no apartment is bigger than any large house.

Looking at the options, let's go through them one by one.

Option A: No large house is bigger than some apartments. That would mean that for some apartments, a large house is bigger than them. But the original statement is that no apartment is bigger than any large house, which is a bit different. Because if no apartment is bigger than any large house, then every large house is bigger than every apartment. So, A is saying that some apartments are smaller than large houses, but the original statement is stronger—it's saying all apartments are smaller than all large houses.

Option B: All apartments are not bigger than some large house. That's a bit unclear. "Not bigger than some" could mean that for each apartment, there exists a large house it's not bigger than. But the original statement is that for every apartment, it's not bigger than every large house, which is a stronger condition.

Option C: No apartment is bigger than any large house. This seems to match what I thought earlier. It's saying that for all apartments and all large houses, the apartment isn't bigger than the large house. So, every large house is bigger than every apartment.

Option D: No large house is bigger than all apartments. Wait, that would mean that for any large house, there is at least one apartment it's not bigger than. Which is different from the original statement. The original says that all apartments are not bigger than all large houses, meaning every large house is bigger than every apartment. So D is saying that no large house is bigger than all apartments, which would mean that for every large house, there's some apartment that's as big or bigger, which isn't what the original says.

Option E: All large houses are bigger than any apartment. This is similar to option C but phrased differently. Wait, "any apartment" would mean that every apartment is smaller than every large house. So E is correct as well? Wait, but let me think. The original statement is that for any apartment x, for any large house y, x is not bigger than y. Which means that every large house is bigger than every apartment. So E says that all large houses are bigger than any apartment, which is correct.

Wait, so both C and E seem to be correct. Hmm, but looking again: C says "No apartment is bigger than any large house." That's equivalent to saying every apartment is smaller than every large house. So, yes, that's the same as E, which says all large houses are bigger than any apartment.

Wait, but looking at the options, I need to see which one is exactly matching.

Wait, the original formula is ∀x (Ax → ∀y [(Hy ∧ Ly) → ¬Bxy]). So, for every apartment x, and for every large house y, x is not bigger than y. So, in other words, every apartment is not bigger than every large house. So, no apartment is bigger than any large house. Which is option C.

Option E says all large houses are bigger than any apartment. That's the same as saying that for any apartment, every large house is bigger than it, which is exactly what the original statement is. So both C and E seem correct. Wait, but let me check the wording.

Option C: No apartment is bigger than any large house. So, for all x (apartment), for all y (large house), x is not bigger than y. So, that's correct.

Option E: All large houses are bigger than any apartment. So, for all y (large house), for all x (apartment), y is bigger than x. Which is the same as the original statement.

Wait, so both C and E are equivalent? Because "no apartment is bigger than any large house" is the same as "every large house is bigger than every apartment." So both C and E are correct. But looking back at the options, perhaps I made a mistake because the options might not have both correct.

Wait, let me check the options again.

Option C: No apartment is bigger than any large house.

Option E: All large houses are bigger than any apartment.

Wait, but the original statement is that for any apartment x, for any large house y, x is not bigger than y. So, every apartment is not bigger than every large house, which is exactly what both C and E are saying. So, are both correct? But that can't be, because the options are supposed to have one correct answer.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the wording. Let me think again.

The original statement is ∀x (Ax → ∀y [(Hy ∧ Ly) → ¬Bxy]). So, for any x, if x is an apartment, then for any y, if y is a large house, then x is not bigger than y. So, for any apartment x, and any large house y, x is not bigger than y. So, every apartment is smaller than every large house.

So, in other words, no apartment is bigger than any large house (C) and all large houses are bigger than any apartment (E). So both C and E are correct. But looking at the options, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the wording is slightly different. Let me read the options again carefully.

Option C: No apartment is bigger than any large house.

Option E: All large houses are bigger than any apartment.

Wait, "any apartment" in E would mean that for any large house, it's bigger than every apartment. Which is the same as the original statement. So both C and E are correct. But that can't be the case in a multiple-choice question. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the translation.

Wait, in the original statement, it's ∀x (Ax → ∀y [(Hy ∧ Ly) → ¬Bxy]). So, for every apartment x, for every large house y, x is not bigger than y. So, for all x (apartments) and y (large houses), x ≤ y in size.

So, this means that all large houses are bigger than all apartments. So, E says "All large houses are bigger than any apartment." That's correct because any apartment is smaller than any large house.

C says "No apartment is bigger than any large house," which is also correct because every apartment is smaller than every large house.

Wait, so both C and E are correct? That can't be right because the options shouldn't have two correct answers. Maybe I'm making a mistake in interpreting the options.

Wait, perhaps I'm misreading the options. Let me check again.

Option C: No apartment is bigger than any large house.

Option E: All large houses are bigger than any apartment.

Wait, actually, these are logically equivalent. So, perhaps the question is designed to have both correct, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps only one is correct based on the wording.

Wait, perhaps the original statement is that for every apartment x, for every large house y, x is not bigger than y. So, that is, for any apartment and any large house, the apartment is not bigger. So, that means that all large houses are bigger than all apartments, which is E.

Alternatively, that also means that no apartment is bigger than any large house, which is C.

So, both C and E are correct. But looking at the options, perhaps the correct answer is E because it's a positive statement, but that's not a logical reason. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing a nuance in the wording.

Wait, perhaps the difference is in the wording: "any apartment" vs. "any large house." Let me think.

In E: "All large houses are bigger than any apartment." So, for any large house, it's bigger than any apartment. Which is the same as saying that every apartment is smaller than every large house.

In C: "No apartment is bigger than any large house." Which is the same as saying that every apartment is smaller than every large house.

So, both are correct. But that can't be the case. Therefore, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the translation.

Wait, perhaps the original statement is that for all x, if x is an apartment, then for all y, if y is a large house, then x is not bigger than y. So, that is, all apartments are not bigger than all large houses.

So, that's equivalent to saying that all large houses are bigger than all apartments, which is E.

Alternatively, it's also equivalent to saying that no apartment is bigger than any large house, which is C.

So, both are correct, but perhaps the intended answer is E because it's a more straightforward positive statement.

Wait, but looking at the options, perhaps the answer is E. Let me check the options again.

Wait, the options are:

A: No large house is bigger than some apartments.

B: All apartments are not bigger than some large house.

C: No apartment is bigger than any large house.

D: No large house is bigger than all apartments.

E: All large houses are bigger than any apartment.

F: No apartment is smaller than any large house.

G: All large houses are not bigger than some apartment.

H: Some apartments are not bigger than all large houses.

I: Some large houses are not bigger than all apartments.

J: All apartments are bigger than any large house.

So, the original statement is that for all x (apartments), for all y (large houses), x is not bigger than y. So, that's equivalent to saying that all large houses are bigger than all apartments, which is E.

Alternatively, it's also equivalent to C: No apartment is bigger than any large house.

Wait, but looking at the options, perhaps E is the correct answer because it's more direct. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is C.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the exact wording. The original statement is ∀x (Ax → ∀y [(Hy ∧ Ly) → ¬Bxy]). So, for any apartment x, for any large house y, x is not bigger than y. So, that means that every apartment is smaller than every large house. So, that's exactly what E says: All large houses are bigger than any apartment.

Yes, because for any apartment, every large house is bigger. So, E is correct.

But wait, C says "No apartment is bigger than any large house," which is the same as E. So, both seem correct. But perhaps in the options, only one is presented. Let me check the options again to see if I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the original statement is not exactly the same as E. Let me think again.

The original statement says that for all x, if x is an apartment, then for all y, if y is a large house, then x is not bigger than y. So, that's equivalent to saying that for every apartment x and every large house y, x ≤ y. So, that means every large house is bigger than every apartment, which is E.

Alternatively, that's also equivalent to saying that no apartment is bigger than any large house, which is C.

But looking at the options, perhaps the intended answer is E because it's phrased as a positive statement about large houses being bigger, rather than a negative statement about apartments not being bigger.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is both C and E, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is E.

Wait, but let me think again. The original statement is ∀x (Ax → ∀y [(Hy ∧ Ly) → ¬Bxy]). So, for any apartment x, for any large house y, x is not bigger than y. So, that's the same as saying that every apartment is smaller than every large house. So, E is correct because it says that all large houses are bigger than any apartment.

So, I think the correct answer is E.
</think>

The proposition is ∀x (Ax → ∀y [(Hy ∧ Ly) → ¬Bxy]), which states that for every apartment x, and for every large house y, x is not bigger than y. This means every apartment is smaller than every large house, making E the best interpretation.

Answer: E
