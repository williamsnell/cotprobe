Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The reaction given is 3H₂ + N₂ ⇌ 2NH₃. I need to find the standard heat (I think that's the standard enthalpy change) at 500°C. The data provided includes the ΔH_reaction at 25°C, which is -22.08 kcal, and some other values labeled α, β, γ for NH₃, N₂, and H₂. I'm not exactly sure what α, β, γ stand for here. Maybe they're the standard enthalpies of formation or something else. Wait, looking closer, the data is presented with numbers like 6.086, 8.812x10^-3, etc. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps α, β, γ are the standard enthalpies of formation (ΔHf°) of NH₃, N₂, and H₂ respectively. Because N₂ and H₂ are diatomic gases, their standard enthalpies of formation at 25°C (which is 298 K) are zero, right? Because they're in their standard states. So maybe those values are for something else, like bond dissociation energies or maybe heat capacities? Or maybe they're the standard molar enthalpies, but I'm not certain.

Wait, looking at the data again. It's given as:

NH₃: 6.086, 8.812x10^-3, -1.506x10^-6
N₂: 6.524, 1.250x10^-3, -0.001x10^-6
H₂: 6.947 = 0.200x10^-3, 0.481x10^-6

Wait, that's a bit confusing. Oh, maybe those are the values for α, β, γ. So perhaps each substance has three values. Maybe α is the standard molar enthalpy at 25°C, β is the heat capacity (maybe C_p), and γ is the temperature coefficient or something else. Alternatively, perhaps they're the coefficients for the equation used to calculate ΔH at different temperatures using the formula ΔH(T) = ΔH° + ∑νi [Cp,i (T - T_ref) + ...], but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, let me recall. The standard enthalpy change of a reaction can be calculated using the formula:

ΔH(T) = ΔH°(25°C) + Σ [νi * (Cp,i * (T - 25°C))]

But wait, that's an approximation. Alternatively, the more accurate method would involve using the heat capacities and the van 't Hoff equation or Kirchhoff's law, which relates the change in enthalpy with temperature. Kirchhoff's law states that the change in enthalpy with temperature is given by:

dΔH/dT = Σ [νi * (Cp,i)]

Where νi is the stoichiometric coefficient and Cp,i is the molar heat capacity (constant pressure) of each substance.

So, to find ΔH at 500°C (which is 773 K or 500 + 273.15 = 773.15 K), I need to calculate the change from 25°C (298 K) to 500°C (773 K).

Given that, the approach would be:

1. Calculate the change in temperature, ΔT = 773 K - 298 K = 475 K.
2. Find the sum of (νi * Cp,i) for each substance in the reaction.
3. Multiply this sum by ΔT to get the change in ΔH.
4. Add this change to the original ΔH° at 25°C to get the new ΔH at 500°C.

Wait, but the problem states that the ΔH_reaction at 25°C is -22.08 kcal. I'll need to convert that into calories because the options are given in cal. Wait, 1 kcal is 1000 cal, so -22.08 kcal is -22,080 cal. That's actually one of the options (I). But the question is about 500°C, so I can't just take that value directly. So I need to adjust for the temperature change.

But wait, I'm a bit confused about the data given. Let me re-examine the data provided:

The data is presented as:

NH3: 6.086, 8.812e-3, -1.506e-6
N2: 6.524, 1.250e-3, -0.001e-6
H2: 6.947, 0.200e-3, 0.481e-6

Wait, perhaps the numbers are in different units. The first number might be the standard molar enthalpy (ΔHf°), the second the molar heat capacity (Cp), and the third maybe the constant term for the heat capacity equation. Alternatively, perhaps these are Cp values at different temperatures, but that's less likely.

Wait, another thought: sometimes, when using Kirchhoff's law, you might have to use the average heat capacity over the temperature interval. But perhaps here, each substance's Cp is given, and we can use that to calculate the change.

Alternatively, perhaps each of these values is in a specific unit. Let's look at the numbers:

NH3: 6.086, which is about 6.086 kcal/mol? Or perhaps cal/(mol·K).

Wait, considering that enthalpy is in kcal and cal, the units for Cp are likely cal/(mol·K). Let me check typical values. The molar heat capacity of NH3 is around 33.38 J/(mol·K), which converts to about 7.994 cal/(mol·K) (since 1 J = 0.239 cal). But the given value for NH3 is 6.086, which is lower than that. Hmm, possibly in different units or perhaps just placeholder numbers.

Wait, maybe the first number for each substance is the standard molar enthalpy at 25°C, the second the molar Cp, and the third perhaps a correction term. Or maybe they're coefficients for a polynomial expansion of Cp with temperature.

Alternatively, perhaps the data is given as Cp values in cal/(mol·K). Let me try to proceed with that assumption.

So, for each substance, the data might be:

NH3: Cp = 6.086 cal/(mol·K)
N2: Cp = 1.250e-3 cal/(mol·K) → Wait, that can't be right because N2's Cp is about 29.1 J/(mol·K) ≈ 6.96 cal/(mol·K), so 1.25e-3 seems too low.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the numbers are in different units. Let me check the units again. Maybe the first number is in kcal/(mol·K), but that seems too high. Alternatively, perhaps the first number is the standard molar enthalpy (ΔHf°) in kcal/mol, the second is Cp in cal/(mol·K), and the third is another term. Hmm, but that complicates things.

Alternatively, perhaps the data is presented as coefficients for a polynomial expansion of the heat capacity. For example, Cp might be expressed as a polynomial in temperature, like Cp = a + b*T + c*T^2, etc. But without knowing the exact setup, it's a bit tricky.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me see what the question gives me. The ΔH at 25°C is -22.08 kcal. I need to find the ΔH at 500°C. So, perhaps I can use the Kirchhoff's law approach, assuming that the change in ΔH is due to the heat capacities of the reactants and products.

The formula would be:

ΔH(T2) = ΔH(T1) + Σ [νi * Cp,i * (T2 - T1)]

Where T1 is 25°C (298 K), T2 is 500°C (773 K), and νi are the stoichiometric coefficients.

So, first, I need the Cp for each substance involved in the reaction.

Looking back at the data:

NH3: 6.086, 8.812e-3, -1.506e-6
N2: 6.524, 1.250e-3, -0.001e-6
H2: 6.947, 0.200e-3, 0.481e-6

Wait, maybe the first number is the molar enthalpy, and the second is Cp. Alternatively, perhaps the first number is the standard molar enthalpy of formation (ΔHf°) in kcal/mol, and the second is the molar Cp in cal/(mol·K). Let's check the units again.

If the first number is ΔHf° in kcal/mol, then:

NH3: ΔHf° = 6.086 kcal/mol
N2: ΔHf° = 6.524 kcal/mol
H2: ΔHf° = 6.947 kcal/mol

But wait, at standard conditions, the ΔHf° of N2 and H2 are zero because they are in their standard states. So that can't be right. So perhaps the first number is something else, like the molar Cp in cal/(mol·K). Let me check typical Cp values:

H2: Cp ≈ 33.6 J/(mol·K) ≈ 8.04 cal/(mol·K)
N2: Cp ≈ 33.4 J/(mol·K) ≈ 7.98 cal/(mol·K)
NH3: Cp ≈ 33.3 J/(mol·K) ≈ 7.96 cal/(mol·K)

But the data given for H2 is 6.947, which is close to 7 cal/(mol·K). Similarly, N2 is 6.524, which is a bit lower than expected. Maybe the data is in cal/(mol·K).

Alternatively, perhaps the first number is the molar Cp, the second is the second derivative, and the third is the third derivative for a polynomial fit. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the data is presented in a way that each substance has three coefficients for its heat capacity as a function of temperature, like Cp = a + b*T + c*T^2. But without more context, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps the data is given in a table where each row represents the substance and the three values are, for example, the standard molar enthalpy, heat capacity, and another term. But I'm not entirely clear.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to proceed with the assumption that the second number in each row is the molar Cp in cal/(mol·K), and the first is perhaps the standard molar enthalpy, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the second number is the Cp, and the first is irrelevant for this calculation.

Wait, the reaction is 3H₂ + N₂ → 2NH₃. So, the stoichiometric coefficients are:

H₂: 3 moles (reactant)
N₂: 1 mole (reactant)
NH₃: 2 moles (product)

So, using Kirchhoff's law, the change in ΔH would be:

ΔΔH = Σ [νi * Cp,i * (T2 - T1)]

Where νi are the stoichiometric coefficients, and Cp,i are their molar heat capacities (assuming constant pressure).

So, let's compute the sum:

For H₂: ν = 3, Cp = let's say 6.947 cal/(mol·K) (assuming the second number is Cp)
Wait, but looking at the data, for H₂, the numbers are 6.947, 0.200e-3, 0.481e-6. So perhaps the second number is Cp. So H₂'s Cp is 0.200e-3 cal/(mol·K), which is 0.0002 cal/(mol·K). That seems way too low. That can't be right because the actual Cp for H₂ is around 8 cal/(mol·K). So perhaps my initial assumption is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the numbers are in different units, like J/(mol·K). Let's check:

If H₂'s Cp is 6.947 J/(mol·K), that's approximately 1.659 cal/(mol·K). But that's still not matching the actual value. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the first number in each row is the molar Cp in cal/(mol·K). So:

NH3: Cp = 6.086 cal/(mol·K)
N2: Cp = 6.524 cal/(mol·K)
H2: Cp = 6.947 cal/(mol·K)

Wait, that would make more sense because those values are in the ballpark of actual Cp values. Let me check:

H₂'s Cp is about 8 cal/(mol·K), so 6.947 is a bit lower but maybe acceptable for an approximation.

N₂'s Cp is about 7 cal/(mol·K), so 6.524 is close.

NH3's Cp is about 7 cal/(mol·K), so 6.086 is a bit lower but possible.

If that's the case, then the data is giving the molar Cp for each substance as the first number.

In that case, the values would be:

NH3: 6.086 cal/(mol·K)
N2: 6.524 cal/(mol·K)
H2: 6.947 cal/(mol·K)

Now, using these, I can compute the sum.

So, the reaction is 3H₂ + N₂ → 2NH₃.

The change in enthalpy at temperature T2 (500°C) relative to T1 (25°C) is given by:

ΔΔH = [Σ (ν_products * Cp(products)) ] - [Σ (ν_reactants * Cp(reactants)))] * (T2 - T1)

So, compute for each substance:

For products: 2 moles of NH3. So 2 * 6.086 = 12.172 cal/(mol·K)
For reactants: 3 moles of H2 and 1 mole of N2. So 3*6.947 + 1*6.524 = 20.841 + 6.524 = 27.365 cal/(mol·K)

So, difference (products - reactants) = 12.172 - 27.365 = -15.193 cal/(mol·K)

Multiply by ΔT = 773 K - 298 K = 475 K.

So, ΔΔH = (-15.193 cal/(mol·K)) * 475 K = -15.193 * 475 ≈ Let me calculate that.

15.193 * 475:

15 * 475 = 7,125

0.193 * 475 ≈ 91.825

So total ≈ 7,125 + 91.825 = 7,216.825 cal/mol, but since it's negative, it's -7,216.825 cal.

Now, the original ΔH at 25°C is -22,080 cal (since -22.08 kcal = -22,080 cal). So the new ΔH at 500°C is:

ΔH(500°C) = ΔH(25°C) + ΔΔH = (-22,080) + (-7,216.825) = -29,296.825 cal.

Wait, but looking at the options, the closest one is H: -30,000 cal, but that's a bit off. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me recheck the Cp values. Did I take the correct Cp for each substance?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in assigning the Cp values. Let me look again at the data:

The data is presented as:

NH3: 6.086, 8.812e-3, -1.506e-6
N2: 6.524, 1.250e-3, -0.001e-6
H2: 6.947, 0.200e-3, 0.481e-6

So, perhaps the first number is not the Cp. Maybe the second number is Cp. Let's try that.

So, for NH3, Cp = 8.812e-3 cal/(mol·K). That's 0.008812 cal/(mol·K), which is way too low. Actual Cp is around 7 cal/(mol·K), so this can't be right. So that approach is incorrect.

Hmm, perhaps the first number is the molar Cp in cal/(mol·K), and the other numbers are for different substances or perhaps different terms. Alternatively, perhaps the data is presented in a different way.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the data given is the standard molar enthalpy of formation at 25°C for each substance. So, for NH3, ΔHf° is 6.086 kcal/mol, N2 is 6.524 kcal/mol, and H2 is 6.947 kcal/mol. But that can't be correct because N2 and H2 have ΔHf° = 0 in their standard states.

So, perhaps the first number is the standard molar enthalpy of formation, but that would only apply to NH3, while N2 and H2 would have 0. But the numbers given don't align with reality, so maybe the data is presented differently.

Alternatively, perhaps the data is for the reaction's heat capacity change. For example, the change in enthalpy for the reaction can be calculated using the formula:

ΔH(T) = ΔH° + ΔCp*(T - T°)

Where ΔCp is the difference in heat capacities between products and reactants.

So, ΔCp = Σ (ν_products * Cp(products)) - Σ (ν_reactants * Cp(reactants)).

In this case, using the first numbers as Cp:

ΔCp = [2 * 6.086] - [3 * 6.947 + 1 * 6.524] 

Calculating that:

Products: 2 * 6.086 = 12.172
Reactants: 3 *6.947 = 20.841; 1 *6.524=6.524 → total 27.365

ΔCp = 12.172 -27.365 = -15.193 cal/(mol·K)

Then, ΔH(T) = ΔH° + ΔCp*(T - T°)

ΔH° at 25°C is -22,080 cal (since 22.08 kcal = 22,080 cal).

T = 500°C = 773 K
T° = 25°C = 298 K
ΔT = 773 - 298 = 475 K

So, ΔH(T) = (-22,080) + (-15.193)*475

Calculating (-15.193)*475:

15 * 475 = 7,125 → so 15.193 * 475 ≈ 7,216.825 → since it's negative, it's -7,216.825.

Adding to ΔH°: -22,080 + (-7,216.825) = -29,296.825 cal.

Looking at the options, the closest is H: -30,000 cal, but that's not exact. Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps I should use more precise Cp values. Let me recalculate the Cp for each substance.

Wait, perhaps the data is given in J/(mol·K), not cal/(mol·K). Let me try that.

If the first number is in J/(mol·K), then:

NH3: 6.086 J/(mol·K) ≈ 1.45 cal/(mol·K)
N2: 6.524 J/(mol·K) ≈ 1.55 cal/(mol·K)
H2: 6.947 J/(mol·K) ≈ 1.65 cal/(mol·K)

But these are way lower than the actual Cp values, which are around 7 cal/(mol·K). So that can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps the numbers are in kJ/(mol·K), but that seems too high.

Wait, perhaps the first number is the standard molar enthalpy of formation, and the second and third are for other terms, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the data is presented as the standard molar enthalpy of each substance, but that's not helpful because only NH3 has a non-zero value.

Wait, perhaps the data is about the reaction's heat capacities, but I'm stuck.

Wait, another angle: Maybe the given data includes the standard molar enthalpies of formation at 25°C, and the heat capacities. Let me try that.

Assuming:

ΔHf°(NH3) = 6.086 kcal/mol
ΔHf°(N2) = 0 kcal/mol
ΔHf°(H2) = 0 kcal/mol

Then, the standard enthalpy change for the reaction at 25°C is:

ΔH° = [2 * ΔHf°(NH3)] - [3 * ΔHf°(H2) + 1 * ΔHf°(N2)] 
= 2*6.086 - [3*0 + 1*0] 
= 12.172 kcal

But the problem states that ΔH_reaction at 25°C is -22.08 kcal, which contradicts this. So that can't be right.

Hmm, perhaps the data isn't about enthalpy of formation but something else. Maybe the standard molar Gibbs free energy or something else.

Wait, perhaps the data is in a different format, with each row representing a substance and the three values being the standard molar enthalpy (ΔHf°), the molar Cp, and another term. But without knowing, it's hard to proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps the first number is the standard molar enthalpy, and the second is the molar Cp in cal/(mol·K). Let me try that.

So, for NH3:

ΔHf° = 6.086 kcal/mol → 6,086 cal/mol
Cp = 8.812e-3 cal/(mol·K) → 0.008812 cal/(mol·K)

That's way too low for Cp, so that can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps the data is given in a different way. Maybe the numbers are for the reaction, not per substance. But that doesn't make much sense.

Wait, perhaps the data is presented in a table where each row is a substance, and the three numbers are for the standard molar enthalpy, the average Cp, and another term. But I'm not making progress.

Wait, perhaps I should proceed with the assumption that the second number in each row is the molar Cp in cal/(mol·K). So:

NH3: Cp = 8.812e-3 = 0.008812 cal/(mol·K) → way too low.
N2: Cp = 1.250e-3 = 0.00125 cal/(mol·K) → way too low.
H2: Cp = 0.200e-3 = 0.0002 cal/(mol·K) → way too low.

That can't be right because the actual Cp values are around 7 cal/(mol·K). So perhaps the data is in J/(mol·K), but then 8.812e-3 J/K/mol is 0.008812 J/(mol·K) = 0.00209 cal/(mol·K), which is still too low.

Wait, perhaps the data is given as the standard molar enthalpy (in kcal/mol), and the second and third numbers are for the Cp in kcal/(mol·K). Let me check:

If NH3's Cp is 8.812e-3 kcal/(mol·K), that's 8.812e-3 * 1000 = 8.812 cal/(mol·K), which is close to actual values. Similarly, N2's Cp would be 1.250e-3 kcal/(mol·K) = 1.25 cal/(mol·K), and H2's Cp is 0.200e-3 = 0.2 cal/(mol·K). But H2's Cp is around 8 cal/(mol·K), so 0.2 is way too low. So this approach doesn't fit.

I'm stuck. Maybe I should try a different approach. Let's see the options given. The original ΔH at 25°C is -22,080 cal. The options are:

A: 22,500 cal
B: -25,570 cal
C: 18,000 cal
D: -18,267 cal
E: -19,500 cal
F: 15.193 cal
G: -20,000 cal
H: -30,000 cal
I: -22,080 cal
J: -17,500 cal

The options are all in cal except F, which is 15 cal, which seems way too small. So, the correct answer is probably in the range of -20,000 to -30,000 cal.

From my earlier calculation with the assumption that the first number is Cp in cal/(mol·K), I got ΔH(500°C) ≈ -29,297 cal, which is close to option H (-30,000 cal). But perhaps I made a mistake in the Cp values.

Alternatively, perhaps the data is presented in a different way. Let me try using the second number as Cp.

So, NH3: Cp = 8.812e-3 cal/(mol·K) = 0.008812 cal/(mol·K)
N2: Cp =1.250e-3 = 0.00125 cal/(mol·K)
H2: Cp=0.200e-3=0.0002 cal/(mol·K)

With these values, compute ΔCp.

ΔCp = [2 * 0.008812] - [3*0.0002 + 1*0.00125] 
= 0.017624 - (0.0006 + 0.00125)
= 0.017624 - 0.00185
= 0.015774 cal/(mol·K)

Then, ΔΔH = 0.015774 * 475 K ≈ 7.528 cal/mol

Adding to ΔH°: -22,080 + 7.528 ≈ -22,072.5 cal, which is close to option I (-22,080 cal). But this seems unlikely because the Cp values are way too low.

Wait, that gives a positive change, but the reaction's enthalpy becomes slightly less negative. But I'm not sure if that's correct.

Alternatively, if I use the third number as Cp, which for NH3 is -1.506e-6, that's even smaller. So that approach is worse.

I think I'm stuck because I can't figure out what the data represents. Alternatively, perhaps the data is given for the reaction, not per substance. But that's unclear.

Wait, perhaps the data is in a different format. Maybe each row represents the standard molar enthalpy, and the other numbers are something else. Alternatively, perhaps the numbers are in a table where each row is a substance and the three numbers are the standard molar enthalpy, Cp, and another term, but without knowing, it's impossible.

Given that, perhaps the intended approach is to use the first number as the molar Cp in cal/(mol·K). Then, with the calculation leading to option H (-30,000 cal), which is close to my earlier calculation of -29,297 cal.

Alternatively, perhaps the data is presented such that the second number is the molar Cp, and the first is something else. But without clarity, it's hard to proceed.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the data is given as the standard molar enthalpy of each substance and the molar Cp. For example, for NH3, the standard molar enthalpy is 6.086 kcal/mol, and Cp is 8.812e-3 kcal/(mol·K). Let me try that.

So, in kcal/(mol·K):

NH3: Cp = 8.812e-3 = 0.008812 kcal/(mol·K)
N2: Cp = 1.250e-3 = 0.00125 kcal/(mol·K)
H2: Cp = 0.200e-3 = 0.0002 kcal/(mol·K)

Then, ΔCp for the reaction:

ΔCp = [2 * 0.008812] - [3 * 0.0002 + 1 * 0.00125]
= 0.017624 - (0.0006 + 0.00125)
= 0.017624 - 0.00185
= 0.015774 kcal/(mol·K)

ΔT = 475 K

ΔΔH = 0.015774 * 475 ≈ 7.528 kcal/mol → 7,528 cal/mol

Add to ΔH°: -22,080 + 7,528 = -14,552 cal, which isn't among the options. So that can't be right.

Hmm. Maybe I should consider that the data is given in a different way, perhaps the first number is the standard molar enthalpy, and the second is the Cp in J/(mol·K), which I can convert to cal/(mol·K).

For example:

NH3: Cp = 8.812e-3 J/(mol·K) → 8.812e-3 / 4.184 ≈ 0.002108 cal/(mol·K)
N2: Cp = 1.250e-3 → 1.250e-3 /4.184 ≈ 0.000300 cal/(mol·K)
H2: Cp = 0.200e-3 → 0.200e-3 /4.184 ≈ 0.0000478 cal/(mol·K)

Then, ΔCp = [2 * 0.002108] - [3 * 0.0000478 + 1 * 0.000300]
= 0.004216 - (0.0001434 + 0.0003)
= 0.004216 - 0.0004434 ≈ 0.0037726 cal/(mol·K)

ΔΔH = 0.0037726 *475 ≈ 1.789 cal/mol

Add to ΔH°: -22,080 +1.789 ≈ -22,078.2 cal, which is very close to option I (-22,080 cal). But that seems odd because the change is negligible, and the reaction's ΔH isn't changing much with temperature, which might not be realistic.

But considering the options, option I is the original value, so that can't be the case. So perhaps this approach is incorrect.

Wait, maybe I should consider that the data is presented in a table where each row is a substance and the three values are the standard molar enthalpy, and the other two are for Cp as a function of temperature, perhaps in a polynomial form. For example, Cp might be expressed as a0 + a1*T + a2*T^2. But without knowing the exact form, it's hard to proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps the data is irrelevant, and the reaction's ΔH doesn't change with temperature, which would make the answer I (-22,080 cal). But that's unlikely because enthalpy does change with temperature.

Wait, perhaps the question expects me to use the given ΔH at 25°C and not adjust it for temperature, but that would make the answer I. However, the question specifically asks for the heat at 500°C, so that can't be the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the data provided isn't needed, and the question expects me to know that the enthalpy change remains the same, but that's not true.

Wait, perhaps I should look for another approach. Let me think: another way to calculate enthalpy change with temperature is using the van 't Hoff equation, but that relates to the change in the equilibrium constant with temperature, not directly to enthalpy change.

Alternatively, perhaps the given data includes the standard molar enthalpies and the Cp values, and the calculation is straightforward.

Wait, perhaps the given data is in a table where each row corresponds to a substance and the three numbers are the standard molar enthalpy, and the Cp at 25°C and another term. But I'm not making progress.

Given that I'm stuck, perhaps I should look for the option that is close to my initial calculation of -29,297 cal, which would be option H (-30,000 cal). Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the sign.

Wait, let me recheck the sign. The reaction is exothermic at 25°C because ΔH is negative (-22,080 cal). If the reaction becomes more exothermic (more negative) with temperature, the ΔΔH would be negative. Alternatively, if the reaction becomes less exothermic (less negative), ΔΔH would be positive.

In my earlier calculation with the first numbers as Cp, I got ΔΔH as -7,216.825 cal, leading to ΔH = -29,296 cal. But perhaps the correct approach is to subtract the reactants' Cp from the products', leading to a positive ΔCp.

Wait, let me re-express:

ΔCp = Σ (ν_products * Cp(products)) - Σ (ν_reactants * Cp(reactants)).

If ΔCp is positive, then as temperature increases, ΔH increases (becomes less negative).

In my earlier calculation using first numbers as Cp:

ΔCp = (2*6.086) - (3*6.947 + 1*6.524) = 12.172 - (20.841 +6.524)=12.172-27.365= -15.193 cal/(mol·K)

So ΔΔH = (-15.193) *475 = -7,216.825 cal

Thus, ΔH(500°C)= -22,080 -7,216.825= -29,296.825 cal.

The closest option is H (-30,000 cal), but the correct calculation would be more precise.

Alternatively, perhaps the data is presented such that the first number is the molar Cp in cal/(mol·K), and I should use that.

Thus, the answer would be approximately -29,297 cal, which rounds to -29,300 cal. The closest option is H (-30,000 cal), but perhaps the intended answer is D (-18,267 cal), but that doesn't align with my calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recompute the ΔCp.

ΔCp = [2 * 6.086] - [3 *6.947 + 1 *6.524]

= 12.172 - (20.841 +6.524)
= 12.172 -27.365
= -15.193 cal/(mol·K)

ΔT=475 K

ΔΔH= -15.193 *475 = ?

Let me compute 15 *475=7,125

0.193 *475 = let's compute 0.1*475=47.5, 0.09*475=42.75, 0.003*475=1.425 → total 47.5+42.75=90.25 +1.425=91.675

So total ΔΔH= - (7,125 +91.675)= -7,216.675 cal

ΔH(500°C)= -22,080 + (-7,216.675)= -29,296.675 cal

The options don't have this exact value, but option H is -30,000 cal, which is close.

Alternatively, perhaps the data is presented such that the third number is the Cp. Let me see:

NH3: third number is -1.506e-6 → negligible
N2: third number is -0.001e-6 → negligible
H2: third number is 0.481e-6 → negligible

So using these would result in an even smaller ΔCp, making the change in ΔH negligible, which would make option I the correct answer. But that seems unlikely.

Given all this, I think the intended answer is option I (-22,080 cal), assuming that the data isn't needed, but that contradicts the question's requirement to use the data. Alternatively, perhaps the data isn't relevant, and the answer remains the same, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the data is presented as the standard molar enthalpy of each substance at 500°C, but that's unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps the question expects me to use the given ΔH at 25°C and not adjust it, but that would be option I.

But the question specifically asks for the heat at 500°C, so I must adjust it. Given that, I think the intended answer is option D (-18,267 cal), but I'm not sure how that comes about.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation earlier. Let me try using the second numbers as Cp.

NH3: Cp=8.812e-3 cal/(mol·K)
N2: Cp=1.250e-3 cal/(mol·K)
H2: Cp=0.200e-3 cal/(mol·K)

ΔCp = [2 * 8.812e-3] - [3 *0.200e-3 + 1*1.250e-3]

= 0.017624 - (0.0006 + 0.00125)
= 0.017624 - 0.00185 = 0.015774 cal/(mol·K)

ΔΔH = 0.015774 *475 ≈7.528 cal

ΔH(500°C)= -22,080 +7.528 ≈-22,072.5 cal → close to option I.

But that seems too small a change, so perhaps this isn't the right approach.

I'm stuck, but given the options, the most plausible answer based on my initial calculation is H (-30,000 cal).

The problem involves determining the standard enthalpy change (ΔH) for the reaction \( 3H_2 + N_2 \rightharpoonup 2NH_3 \) at 500°C using the provided data. The reaction's ΔH at 25°C is given as -22.08 kcal (-22,080 cal). To find ΔH at 500°C, the approach involves using Kirchhoff's law, which relates the change in enthalpy with temperature:

\[
\Delta H(T_2) = \Delta H(T_1) + \Delta C_p \cdot (T_2 - T_1)
\]

Here, \( \Delta C_p \) is the difference in heat capacities between products and reactants:

\[
\Delta C_p = \sum (\nu_{\text{products}} \cdot C_{p,\text{products}}) - \sum (\nu_{\text{reactants}} \cdot C_{p,\text{reactants}})
\]

The reaction's stoichiometric coefficients are:
- \( H_2 \): 3 moles (reactant)
- \( N_2 \): 1 mole (reactant)
- \( NH_3 \): 2 moles (product)

Assuming the first number in the provided data represents the molar heat capacity (\( C_p \)) in cal/(mol·K), the values are:
- \( NH_3 \): 6.086 cal/(mol·K)
- \( N_2 \): 6.524 cal/(mol·K)
- \( H_2 \): 6.947 cal/(mol·K)

Calculating \( \Delta C_p \):
\[
\Delta C_p = [2 \cdot 6.086] - [3 \cdot 6.947 + 1 \cdot 6.524]
\]
\[
\Delta C_p = 12.172 - (20.841 + 6.524) = 12.172 - 27.365 = -15.193 \, \text{cal/(mol·K)}
\]

The temperature change is:
\[
\Delta T = 773 \, \text{K} - 298 \, \text{K} = 475 \, \text{K}
\]

The change in enthalpy:
\[
\Delta \Delta H = \Delta C_p \cdot \Delta T = -15.193 \cdot 475 = -7,216.825 \, \text{cal}
\]

Adding this to the original ΔH at 25°C:
\[
\Delta H(500^\circ \text{C}) = -22,080 + (-7,216.825) = -29,296.825 \, \text{cal}
\]

The closest option to this value is **H: -30,000 cal**. While minor discrepancies may exist due to rounding or data interpretation, this is the most reasonable choice based on the calculations.
