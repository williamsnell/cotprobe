Answer the following multiple choice question, selecting from the answer A through to J. After thinking, reply directly with your answer. 

The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

Discuss how the evolutionary heritage of man has shaped human behavior in terms of limits, potentialities, and the development of particular structures.

Options:

A: The development of human behavior is solely dependent on the environment
B: Evolutionary heritage dictates all aspects of human behavior without the influence of culture or learning.
C: Our evolutionary heritage has limited us in certain ways, given us outstanding potentialities for behavior, and resulted in the development of particular structures such as our brain which is uniquely organized for the use of meaningful speech and symbols.
D: Human behavior is not linked to our evolutionary heritage
E: Our evolutionary heritage has resulted in the development of a few specialized structures, with the brain being relatively unspecialized and similar to other primates.
F: Human behavior is a result of evolutionary heritage that mainly emphasizes physical adaptations, with little to no impact on cognitive or social structures.
G: Evolution has equipped humans with a variety of potential behaviors that are expressed identically in all cultures.
H: Evolutionary heritage has no impact on human behavior
I: The evolutionary heritage of humans has led to a fixed set of behaviors that cannot be altered by any means.
J: The evolutionary heritage of man has led to an increase in physical abilities, while cognitive and behavioral development has remained stagnant over time.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about how the evolutionary heritage of humans has shaped our behavior. Hmm, let me think this through step by step.

The question is asking about the evolutionary heritage shaping behavior in terms of limits, potentialities, and the development of structures. So I need to find an option that covers all these aspects.

Looking at the options:

Option A says behavior is solely dependent on the environment. But I know that evolution also plays a role, so this might not be the right one. It seems too simplistic.

Option B claims evolution dictates all behavior without culture or learning. That doesn't sound right because humans are influenced by both nature and nurture. So B might be too extreme.

Option C talks about limits, potentialities, and structures like the brain being unique for speech and symbols. This seems comprehensive. It mentions both the constraints (limits) and the special capabilities (potentialities) we have, plus specific structures like the brain. That fits well with the question.

Option D says behavior isn't linked to evolution. Well, that's not true. Evolution definitely influences behavior, so D is probably incorrect.

Option E says only a few specialized structures developed, but the brain isn't specialized. I don't think that's right. Human brains are highly specialized, so E might be incorrect.

Option F focuses on physical adaptations and neglects cognitive aspects. The question mentions cognitive and social structures, so F doesn't cover everything needed.

Option G suggests behaviors are expressed the same in all cultures. But cultural differences show that behavior varies, so G is likely wrong.

Option H says evolution has no impact, which is false. So H is out.

Option I claims behaviors are fixed and can't change. But humans adapt behaviors, so I isn't correct.

Option J talks about physical abilities increasing but cognitive staying stagnant. That's not accurate because cognitive abilities have definitely evolved and developed.

So, putting it all together, Option C seems to cover all parts of the question: limits, potentialities, and specific structures like the brain. It also correctly acknowledges that evolution has both constrained and enabled us in certain ways, which aligns with what I know about evolutionary psychology and biology.

The correct answer is C because it comprehensively addresses how evolutionary heritage has shaped human behavior by imposing limits, providing potentialities, and developing specific structures like the brain, which is unique for language and symbols. 

C
