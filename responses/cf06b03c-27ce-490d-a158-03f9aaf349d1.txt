Okay, so I have this problem about two gases in separate bulbs. Both are ideal gases, which probably means I can use the ideal gas law here. The question is asking for the ratio of the pressure of gas A to gas B. Let me break down the given information.

First, the density of gas A is twice that of gas B. So if I let the density of B be d, then A's density is 2d. Also, the molecular weight of A is half that of B. Let me denote the molecular weight of B as M, so A's molecular weight is M/2.

Hmm, I remember that density is mass per volume, and for gases, maybe I can relate this to the ideal gas law. The ideal gas law is PV = nRT. But I'm trying to find the pressure ratio, so maybe I can express pressure in terms of density and molecular weight.

Wait, I think there's a relation involving the density of a gas and its molecular weight. Oh right! The molar mass (or molecular weight) M is related to the density ρ by the ideal gas law. Let me think about that.

Starting from PV = nRT, and n = mass / molar mass. Mass is density times volume, so n = (ρV)/M. Substituting into the ideal gas law:

P V = (ρV/M) R T

The V cancels out, so P = (ρ R T) / M.

Oh, right! So pressure P is equal to (density times R times T) divided by the molecular weight.

So, for each gas, P = (ρ R T) / M.

Since both gases are at the same temperature T, I can write the pressures as:

PA = (ρA * R * T) / MA

PB = (ρB * R * T) / MB

I need the ratio PA / PB.

So,

PA / PB = [(ρA / MA) / (ρB / MB)] 

Because R and T are the same and cancel out.

Now, given that density of A is twice that of B: ρA = 2 ρB.

And molecular weight of A is half that of B: MA = MB / 2.

Wait, MB is the molecular weight of B, so MA = (MB)/2.

Let me substitute these into the ratio.

PA / PB = ( (2 ρB) / (MB/2) ) / (ρB / MB )

Simplify numerator first: (2 ρB) divided by (MB/2) equals (2 ρB * 2) / MB = 4 ρB / MB.

Denominator is (ρB / MB).

So the ratio becomes (4 ρB / MB) divided by (ρB / MB).

Which is (4 ρB / MB) * (MB / ρB) ) = 4 * (ρB * MB) / (MB * ρB) ) = 4 * 1 = 4.

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, let me check again.

Wait, PA/PB = [ (2ρB) / (MA) ) ] / [ (ρB) / (MB) ) ]

But MA is MB/2, so:

[ 2ρB / (MB/2) ] / [ ρB / MB ] = [ (2 * 2 ρB ) / MB ] / [ ρB / MB ]

So numerator is 4ρB / MB, denominator is ρB / MB.

So PA/PB = (4ρB / MB) * (MB / ρB) ) = 4.

Wait, but 4 is one of the options. Let me check the options again.

Looking back: The options are A to J, with option C being 4. So the ratio would be 4:1, so 4.

Wait, but wait a second. Density is mass per unit volume. For gases, the density can also be expressed in terms of molar mass and other factors. Let me confirm the formula again.

Alternatively, I can think in terms of molar density, which is number of moles per volume. But I think the approach I took is correct.

Wait, another way: For ideal gases, the density ρ is (PM)/(RT), right? Because from PV = nRT, and n = mass/molar mass, which is (ρV)/M. So, rearranging gives:

PM = ρ R T.

So ρ = PM/(RT).

Wait, but for each gas, at the same T, ρ is proportional to P*M. So ρA = (PA * MA) / (R T), and ρB = (PB * MB)/(R T).

So ρA/ρB = (PA * MA) / (PB * MB).

We know ρA = 2 ρB and MA = MB/2.

Substituting:

2 = (PA * (MB/2)) / (PB * MB )

Simplify:

2 = (PA * MB * (1/2)) ) / ( PB * MB )

MB cancels out.

2 = (PA * 0.5) / PB

Multiply both sides by PB: 2 PB = 0.5 PA

Multiply both sides by 2: 4 PB = PA

So PA = 4 PB → PA/PB = 4.

So the ratio is 4, which is option C.

The ratio of the pressure of gas A to gas B is calculated using the ideal gas law and the given relationships between density and molecular weight. For ideal gases, pressure is proportional to density and inversely proportional to molecular weight. Given that the density of gas A is twice that of gas B and its molecular weight is half, the pressure ratio is determined to be 4.
