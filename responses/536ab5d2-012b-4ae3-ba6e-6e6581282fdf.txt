Okay, so I've got this transformer problem in front of me, and I'm trying to work through it step by step. Let's see what it's asking for.

Alright, the transformer is a two-winding type, rated at 2.2 kVA, with a voltage ratio of 220/110 volts. The frequency is 60 Hz. Winding A is the 220V side with an impedance of 0.24 + j0.40 ohms. Winding B is the 110V side with 0.05 + j0.09 ohms. Core loss is 28 watts at rated conditions.

The transformer is connected as an autotransformer to supply a load at 220V from a 330V source. The load current is 30A at 0.9 power factor lagging. I need to find the voltage regulation and the efficiency.

First, I should probably sketch the autotransformer connection. In an autotransformer, one part of the winding is common to both the primary and secondary. Since the transformer is being used as an autotransformer to step down from 330V to 220V, I think the primary would be connected to the 330V source, and the secondary delivers 220V to the load.

Wait, actually, the autotransformer can be used in two ways: either step-up or step-down. Since the source is 330V and the output is 220V, it's a step-down configuration. The autotransformer will have the high-voltage side connected across the source and the low-voltage side connected to the load. But I'm a bit confused about how the windings are connected. Maybe it's better to think in terms of the turns ratio.

The original transformer has a turns ratio of N1/N2 = 220/110 = 2:1. So N1 is the high-voltage winding (220V) and N2 is the low-voltage (110V). When used as an autotransformer, the total voltage is determined by the combination of the two windings. So for a 330V source, the autotransformer would have the primary connected across the 330V, and the secondary providing 220V.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The autotransformer configuration can be thought of as a single winding with a tap. In this case, the transformer is being used to connect a 330V source to a 220V load. So the autotransformer will have the primary connected to 330V, and the secondary provides 220V to the load.

The turns ratio for an autotransformer is a bit different. Normally, a two-winding transformer has N1 and N2, but in autotransformer, the same winding is used for both primary and secondary. So the voltage ratio is determined by the ratio of the number of turns between the sections. Let me recall the formula for voltage in an autotransformer. The voltage across the load (VL) is given by VL = Vs * (N2/(N1 - N2)), but I might be mixing up the formulas. Alternatively, the voltage ratio is (N1 + N2)/N2, or something like that. Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the way the windings are connected.

Wait no, perhaps I should approach this differently. Since the original transformer is 220/110V, the turns ratio is 2:1. So when used as an autotransformer, the way it's connected would involve the 330V being split across the primary and the autotransformer's windings. Hmm, perhaps I should find the equivalent impedance of the autotransformer when connected in this way.

Wait, maybe it's better to model the autotransformer as a modified two-winding transformer. The autotransformer is formed by connecting the two windings in a way that part of the winding is shared. The equivalent impedance would then depend on how the windings are connected.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the autotransformer in terms of its equivalent circuit. The autotransformer will have the primary connected to the source and the secondary to the load. The equivalent impedance looking into the primary and the secondary can be calculated based on the two windings' impedances and the turns ratio.

Wait, but since it's an autotransformer, the way the windings are connected affects the equivalent impedance. Let me try to model it.

In an autotransformer, the primary is connected across the entire winding, and the secondary is connected across a portion of it. The voltage ratio is determined by the ratio of the number of turns in the portion used for the secondary to the total number of turns.

Given that the original transformer has a 2:1 ratio, when used as an autotransformer to step down from 330V to 220V, the turns ratio would be (330V)/(220V) = 3/2. Wait, that's not right because the autotransformer's voltage ratio depends on how it's tapped. Alternatively, perhaps the autotransformer is tapped at a certain point to create the required voltage.

Wait, maybe I should calculate the equivalent impedance first. The autotransformer can be modeled as a two-winding transformer with a specific connection. The primary is connected to the source, and the secondary is connected to the load. The impedance referred to the primary side would be the sum of the primary winding's impedance and the secondary winding's impedance multiplied by the square of the turns ratio.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the equivalent circuit. The autotransformer's equivalent impedance can be calculated considering the way the windings are connected. Let me denote the primary side as the 330V side and the secondary as the 220V side. The primary has impedance Z1 = 0.24 + j0.40 ohms, and the secondary has Z2 = 0.05 + j0.09 ohms.

In an autotransformer, the secondary is connected in such a way that part of the primary winding is also the secondary. So the equivalent impedance would be Z_eq = Z1 + (Z2 * (N1/N2)^2), but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's Z_eq = Z1 + Z2 * (N1/N2)^2. Wait, no. The impedance from the primary side would be Z1 + (Z2 * (N2/N1)^2), because when you refer the secondary impedance to the primary side, you multiply by the square of the turns ratio (N2/N1). So Z_eq = Z1 + Z2*(N2/N1)^2.

Given that the original transformer has a turns ratio N1/N2 = 220/110 = 2:1. So N2/N1 = 1/2.

So Z_eq = Z1 + Z2*(1/2)^2 = Z1 + Z2*(1/4).

Substituting the values:

Z1 = 0.24 + j0.40 ohms

Z2 = 0.05 + j0.09 ohms

So Z_eq = (0.24 + j0.40) + (0.05 + j0.09)/4

Calculating each part:

(0.05 + j0.09)/4 = 0.0125 + j0.0225

Adding to Z1:

0.24 + 0.0125 = 0.2525 ohms

j0.40 + j0.0225 = j0.4225 ohms

So Z_eq = 0.2525 + j0.4225 ohms.

Now, the source voltage is 330V, and the load current is 30A at 0.9 lagging PF. Wait, but in this configuration, the source is 330V, and the load is 220V. So the primary is connected to 330V, and the secondary delivers 220V to the load.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused about the exact configuration. Alternatively, perhaps I should model the autotransformer as a two-winding transformer with a specific connection. The primary is across the entire winding, and the secondary is across a part of it. So the equivalent impedance would be Z1 in series with the reflected impedance from the secondary side.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the current in the primary and secondary windings. Since it's an autotransformer, the current in the primary is I1, and the current in the secondary is I2, but they share some turns, so the total current would be I_total = I1 + I2 or something like that. Hmm, maybe that's getting complicated.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the current through the primary and secondary windings. Let's think about the load current. The load is 220V and draws 30A at 0.9 PF lagging. So the load power is P = V * I * cosθ = 220 * 30 * 0.9 = 5940 W.

But wait, the transformer is rated at 2.2 kVA, which is 2200 VA. The load current is 30A, which is within the rating since 30A * 220V = 6600 W, which is more than 2200 VA. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 2.2 kVA is 2200 VA, so 220V * 10A = 2200 W, but the load is 30A, which would be 30A * 220V = 6600 W. That's higher than the transformer's rating, which is 2200 VA. That doesn't make sense. Did I misunderstand the problem?

Wait, no, the transformer is rated at 2.2 kVA, which is 2200 VA. So the maximum current it can handle is I = 2200 / 220 = 10A. But the load current is 30A, which is way beyond the rating. That can't be correct. So maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the problem. Alternatively, perhaps the transformer's rating is for each winding, but when used as an autotransformer, the current is shared differently.

Wait, perhaps in the autotransformer configuration, the current is split between the primary and the secondary. So the total current in the primary winding would be I1, and the current in the secondary would be I2, but since they share some turns, the total current isn't simply additive. Alternatively, perhaps the current through the primary is I1, and the secondary is I2, but the sum is I_total = I1 + I2, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I should approach this by finding the current in each part of the autotransformer. Let's model the autotransformer as a two-winding transformer with the primary connected to 330V, and the secondary connected to 220V load.

The equivalent impedance from the primary side is Z_eq = Z1 + (Z2 * (N2/N1)^2) as calculated earlier, which was 0.2525 + j0.4225 ohms.

The source voltage is 330V, so the current through the primary would be I1 = 330 / Z_eq. But I'm not sure if that's correct because the transformer is connected to a load, not just a short circuit.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model the entire circuit. The primary side has the source (330V) in series with Z_eq, and the secondary side is connected to the load, which is R_load.

The load impedance R_load can be calculated from the current and voltage. The load current is 30A at 0.9 PF lagging. The load power factor is 0.9, so the load impedance is Z_load = V_load / I_load * (1 / cosθ), but wait, no. The impedance is Z_load = V_load / I_load * (1 / cosθ) but that's not correct. Actually, Z_load = V_load / I_load * (1 / cosθ), but wait, PF is cosθ, so Z_load = V_load / (I_load * cosθ) ?

Wait, no. The load impedance is purely resistive if PF is 1, but here, the load has a PF of 0.9 lagging, so it's a resistive and inductive load. So the impedance is Z_load = V_load / I_load * (1 / cosθ), but that's not exactly right. Let me think again.

The power factor is cosθ, where θ is the angle between voltage and current. So the impedance is Z = V / I * (1 / cosθ), but that's not correct because V and I are RMS values. The correct formula is Z = V / I, but that's the magnitude. However, the phase angle θ is given by cosθ = 0.9, so the impedance has a phase angle θ as well.

Wait, but the load is purely resistive? No, the load has a power factor of 0.9 lagging, so it's a resistive and inductive load. But perhaps for this calculation, we can model the load as a resistor in series with an inductor, but maybe it's easier to model it as a complex impedance with a magnitude and phase.

But perhaps in this problem, the load is purely resistive? Wait, the problem states a power factor of 0.9 lagging, which implies that the load has both resistance and inductance. So Z_load = R_load + jX_load, where R = I * cosθ * V, but maybe it's better to model it as Z_load = V_load / I_load * (cosθ + j sinθ). Wait, no. Alternatively, since the load is connected across 220V, and the current is 30A at 0.9 PF lagging, the load impedance is Z_load = V / I * (1 / cosθ), but that's not correct because V and I are RMS, so the magnitude is |Z| = V / I, and the angle is θ = arccos(0.9). So Z_load = (220 / 30) * (cosθ + j sinθ), but since it's lagging, the angle is positive.

Wait, let's compute |Z_load|: |Z| = 220 / 30 ≈ 7.333 ohms. The angle θ is arccos(0.9), which is approximately 25.8 degrees.

So Z_load = 7.333 (cos25.8° + j sin25.8°) ≈ 7.333 (0.9 + j0.436) ≈ 6.6 ohms + j3.2 ohms.

Now, the secondary side of the transformer is connected to this load. The secondary voltage is 220V, and the primary is connected to 330V.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me try to model the entire circuit.

The transformer's primary is connected to 330V, and the secondary is connected to the load. The primary has impedance Z1 = 0.24 + j0.40 ohms, and the secondary has Z2 = 0.05 + j0.09 ohms. But when used as an autotransformer, the equivalent impedance seen from the primary would be Z_eq = Z1 + (Z2 * (N2/N1)^2) = Z1 + Z2*(1/2)^2 = Z1 + Z2/4.

As calculated earlier, Z_eq ≈ 0.2525 + j0.4225 ohms.

The source is 330V, and the load is Z_load ≈ 6.6 + j3.2 ohms.

Wait, no. The secondary side is connected to the load, which is 220V, but the load's impedance is Z_load as calculated. So perhaps the secondary side's impedance is Z_load in parallel with Z2, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should model the transformer as a two-winding transformer with the primary connected to 330V and the secondary connected to the load. The equivalent circuit would have the primary's impedance Z1 in series with the secondary's impedance Z2, but transformed by the turns ratio.

Wait, maybe I should use the referred impedance approach. The secondary's impedance is Z2 = 0.05 + j0.09 ohms. When referred to the primary side, it's Z2' = Z2 * (N1/N2)^2 = Z2 * 4, since N1/N2 = 2. So Z2' = 0.05*4 + j0.09*4 = 0.2 + j0.36 ohms.

So the total impedance from the primary side is Z_total = Z1 + Z2' = (0.24 + 0.2) + j(0.40 + 0.36) = 0.44 + j0.76 ohms.

Then, the current through the primary would be I1 = 330V / Z_total. Let's compute that.

First, calculate Z_total: |Z_total| = sqrt(0.44^2 + 0.76^2) = sqrt(0.1936 + 0.5776) = sqrt(0.7712) ≈ 0.878 ohms.

The angle of Z_total is θ = arctan(0.76/0.44) ≈ arctan(1.727) ≈ 60 degrees.

So I1 = 330 / 0.878 ≈ 375.5 A. Wait, that's a very high current, which doesn't make sense because the transformer is only rated for 2.2 kVA. I must have made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps I should model the transformer as an autotransformer with a different turns ratio. Since the transformer is 220/110V, the turns ratio is 2:1. When used as an autotransformer to step down from 330V to 220V, the voltage ratio is 330/220 = 3/2. So the autotransformer's ratio would be 3:2.

Wait, but how does that affect the impedance? The autotransformer's equivalent impedance would be calculated based on this new ratio. Alternatively, perhaps the autotransformer's impedance is calculated by considering the ratio of the sections. Let me think.

In an autotransformer, the total voltage is the sum of the two sections. So if the primary is connected to 330V and the autotransformer is tapped at 220V, then the ratio is 330:220 = 3:2. So the turns ratio is 3:2, meaning the primary has 3 parts and the secondary has 2 parts, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the autotransformer's equivalent impedance is calculated differently. The impedance from the primary side would be Z_eq = Z1 + Z2 * (N2/(N1 - N2))^2, but I'm not confident about this.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the autotransformer as a modified two-winding transformer where the primary is connected across the entire winding, and the secondary is connected across a portion of it. So the equivalent impedance would be Z_eq = Z1 + (Z2 * (N2/(N1 - N2))^2).

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the autotransformer's equivalent circuit. The autotransformer will have the same primary and secondary windings, but connected in a way that part of the winding is common.

In the autotransformer configuration, the primary is connected to the source, and the secondary is connected to the load. The equivalent impedance from the primary side would be Z_eq = Z1 + (Z2 * (N2/(N1 - N2))^2).

Wait, but I'm not sure about this formula. Alternatively, perhaps the equivalent impedance is Z_eq = Z1 + Z2 * (N2/(N1))^2.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should try a different approach. Let's consider the autotransformer as a two-winding transformer with the primary connected to the source and the secondary connected to the load, but with a different turns ratio.

Wait, the original transformer's turns ratio is N1:N2 = 2:1. When used as an autotransformer, the turns ratio would be adjusted to achieve the desired voltage. The autotransformer is tapped such that the voltage across the load is 220V when the source is 330V. So the voltage ratio is 330/220 = 3/2, so the turns ratio would be 3:2.

Wait, but the original transformer's ratio is 2:1, so perhaps the autotransformer's ratio is adjusted by adding the two windings in a certain way.

Alternatively, perhaps the autotransformer is formed by connecting the two windings in series, so the total turns would be N1 + N2, and the tap is set at a certain point to achieve the desired voltage.

Hmm, maybe I should calculate the voltage regulation first, which is the drop across the transformer's windings divided by the rated voltage.

Voltage regulation is given by (V1 - V2)/V2 * 100%, but in this case, it's the drop across the windings when current flows.

Wait, but for voltage regulation, the formula is (V1 - I1 Z1 - I2 Z2) / V2. Wait, no, perhaps it's better to calculate the voltage drop in the primary and secondary windings and then find the regulation.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck on how the current flows in each winding when it's an autotransformer. Perhaps I should model the autotransformer's equivalent circuit.

In an autotransformer, the current in the primary is I1, and the current in the secondary is I2. The relationship between them depends on the turns ratio. Let me denote the turns ratio as a. So a = N1/N2 = 2:1 for the original transformer. But when used as an autotransformer to get a 330V to 220V, the turns ratio would be different.

Wait, perhaps the autotransformer's turns ratio is such that the voltage ratio is 330/220 = 3/2. So a = 3/2. Therefore, the equivalent impedance from the primary side would be Z_eq = Z1 + Z2*(a)^2.

Wait, no. I think I'm confusing the turns ratio here. Alternatively, perhaps the autotransformer's equivalent impedance is Z_eq = Z1 + (Z2 * (N2/N1)^2). Since N1/N2 = 2, then (N2/N1) = 1/2, so Z_eq = Z1 + Z2 * (1/2)^2 = Z1 + Z2/4.

As calculated earlier, Z_eq ≈ 0.2525 + j0.4225 ohms.

Now, the source is 330V, and the load is 220V. The load current is 30A, but wait, the transformer is rated at 2.2 kVA, which is 2200 VA. So 30A * 220V = 6600 W, which is way beyond the rating. That doesn't make sense. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, maybe the load current is 30A at 0.9 PF, but the transformer's rating is 2.2 kVA, which is 2200 VA. So 220V * 10A = 2200 W. So the load current can't be 30A. That suggests I've made a mistake in interpreting the problem.

Wait, perhaps the load is 30A, but the voltage is 220V, so the apparent power is 30A * 220V = 6600 VA, which is way beyond the transformer's rating. That can't be right. So perhaps I've misunderstood the problem setup.

Wait, maybe the transformer is used as an autotransformer to supply a load of 220V from a 330V source, but the load current is 30A. Since the transformer's rating is 2.2 kVA, this seems impossible. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in the setup.

Wait, perhaps the load current is 30A, but the transformer's rating is 2.2 kVA, which is 2200 VA. So 220V * 10A = 2200 VA. So 30A would exceed the rating. Therefore, perhaps the load current is 10A, but the problem says 30A. Hmm, that's confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the transformer as an autotransformer, which effectively increases the current capacity because part of the winding is shared. So the current in the primary would be less than the load current.

Wait, perhaps I should proceed by calculating the current in the primary and secondary windings.

Let me try to model the autotransformer as a two-winding transformer with a specific turns ratio. The primary is connected to 330V, and the secondary is connected to the 220V load.

The turns ratio a = V1/V2 = 330/220 = 3/2. So a = 1.5.

The equivalent impedance from the primary side would be Z_eq = Z1 + Z2*(a)^2. Wait, no. Normally, when you refer the secondary impedance to the primary, you multiply by (N2/N1)^2, which is (1/a)^2. So Z2' = Z2*(1/a)^2 = Z2*(4/9).

So Z_eq = Z1 + Z2*(4/9).

Substituting the values:

Z1 = 0.24 + j0.40 ohms

Z2 = 0.05 + j0.09 ohms

So Z_eq = (0.24 + j0.40) + (0.05 + j0.09)*(4/9)

Calculating each part:

(0.05 + j0.09)*(4/9) = 0.05*(4/9) + j0.09*(4/9) = 0.02222 + j0.04 ohms

Adding to Z1:

0.24 + 0.02222 = 0.2622 ohms

j0.40 + j0.04 = j0.44 ohms

So Z_eq ≈ 0.2622 + j0.44 ohms.

Now, the source is 330V, so the current through the primary would be I1 = 330 / |Z_eq|. Let's compute |Z_eq|:

|Z_eq| = sqrt(0.2622² + 0.44²) ≈ sqrt(0.0687 + 0.1936) ≈ sqrt(0.2623) ≈ 0.512 ohms.

I1 ≈ 330 / 0.512 ≈ 644.5 A. That's way too high, exceeding the transformer's rating of 2.2 kVA (which is 2200 VA). So I must have made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, maybe I should consider the autotransformer as a single winding with a tap. The primary is connected to 330V, and the secondary is tapped at 220V. The autotransformer's equivalent impedance would then be calculated based on the tap position.

The voltage ratio is 330/220 = 1.5, so the turns ratio a = 1.5. The impedance from the primary side would be Z_eq = Z1 + Z2 * (a)^2. Wait, but that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps the autotransformer's equivalent impedance is Z_eq = Z1 + Z2 * (a)^2, where a is the turns ratio. Since a = 1.5, Z_eq = Z1 + Z2*(2.25).

So Z_eq = (0.24 + j0.40) + (0.05 + j0.09)*2.25.

Calculating:

(0.05 + j0.09)*2.25 = 0.1125 + j0.2025.

Adding to Z1:

0.24 + 0.1125 = 0.3525 ohms

j0.40 + j0.2025 = j0.6025 ohms.

So Z_eq = 0.3525 + j0.6025 ohms.

The current I1 = 330 / |Z_eq|.

|Z_eq| = sqrt(0.3525² + 0.6025²) ≈ sqrt(0.1243 + 0.3630) ≈ sqrt(0.4873) ≈ 0.698 ohms.

I1 ≈ 330 / 0.698 ≈ 472.6 A. Again, way too high. So I'm definitely making a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let's consider the autotransformer as a modified two-winding transformer where the primary is connected to the source, and the secondary is connected to the load, but part of the winding is shared. The current in the primary is I1, and the current in the secondary is I2. The relationship between I1 and I2 is determined by the turns ratio.

The turns ratio a = V1/V2 = 330/220 = 1.5. So I2 = a * I1.

The total current in the primary is I1, and the total current in the secondary is I2, but since part of the winding is shared, the actual current in the primary winding would be I_total = I1 + I2.

Wait, but I'm not sure about this. Alternatively, perhaps the current in the primary is I1, and the current in the secondary is I2, with I2 = a * I1.

Wait, perhaps I should set up the equations based on Kirchhoff's laws.

Let me denote:

- V1 = 330V (source voltage)
- V2 = 220V (load voltage)
- I1 = current in the primary winding
- I2 = current in the secondary winding
- The turns ratio a = V1/V2 = 1.5

The impedance of the primary winding is Z1 = 0.24 + j0.40 ohms, and the secondary is Z2 = 0.05 + j0.09 ohms.

In the autotransformer, the current I1 flows through Z1, and the current I2 flows through Z2. But since part of the winding is shared, there's a relationship between I1 and I2.

The voltage drops would be:

V1 = I1 * Z1 + (I1 - I2) * Z2'

Wait, perhaps I should model the autotransformer as a primary with Z1 and a secondary with Z2, but connected in a way that the current I2 is in the opposite direction. So the voltage drop across Z1 is I1 * Z1, and the voltage drop across Z2 is (I1 - I2) * Z2.

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the voltage across the secondary is V2 = I2 * Z2, and the voltage across the primary is V1 = I1 * Z1 + (I1 - I2) * Z2.

Wait, perhaps that's a better approach. So:

V1 = I1 * Z1 + (I1 - I2) * Z2

And the load voltage is V2 = I2 * Z2.

But also, the turns ratio gives us the relationship between I1 and I2. Since a = V1/V2 = 1.5, we have I2 = (V2 / V1) * I1 = (220/330) * I1 = (2/3) * I1.

So I2 = (2/3) I1.

Now, substituting into the first equation:

V1 = I1 Z1 + (I1 - I2) Z2

Substituting I2 = (2/3) I1:

V1 = I1 Z1 + (I1 - (2/3 I1)) Z2 = I1 Z1 + (I1/3) Z2.

Rearranging:

I1 (Z1 + (1/3) Z2) = V1.

So I1 = V1 / (Z1 + (1/3) Z2).

Now, substituting Z1 and Z2:

Z1 = 0.24 + j0.40 ohms

Z2 = 0.05 + j0.09 ohms

So (1/3) Z2 = 0.0166667 + j0.03 ohms.

Adding to Z1:

Z1 + (1/3) Z2 = (0.24 + 0.0166667) + j(0.40 + 0.03) = 0.2566667 + j0.43 ohms.

Now, V1 = 330 V.

So I1 = 330 / (0.2566667 + j0.43).

Let's compute this:

First, find the magnitude of the denominator: |Z| = sqrt(0.2566667² + 0.43²) ≈ sqrt(0.0659 + 0.1849) ≈ sqrt(0.2508) ≈ 0.5008 ohms.

The angle θ = arctan(0.43 / 0.2566667) ≈ arctan(1.674) ≈ 60 degrees.

So I1 = 330 / 0.5008 ≈ 658.7 A. Again, this is way beyond the transformer's rating. So I must be making a mistake in the setup.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the autotransformer's current is split between the primary and the secondary, and the total current is I = I1 + I2, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should model the autotransformer's equivalent impedance correctly. Let me try another approach.

The autotransformer's equivalent impedance from the primary side is Z_eq = Z1 + Z2 * (a)^2, where a is the turns ratio.

But earlier attempts have led to currents beyond the transformer's rating, which suggests I'm not modeling it correctly.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the current in the primary and secondary windings separately.

Given that the load is 220V and draws 30A at 0.9 PF lagging, the load impedance is Z_load = V / I * (1 / cosθ) ?

Wait, no, the load impedance is Z = V / I, and the power factor is cosθ, so the impedance has a magnitude of |Z| = V / I and an angle θ = arccos(0.9).

So |Z_load| = 220 / 30 ≈ 7.333 ohms.

The angle θ ≈ 25.8 degrees.

So Z_load = 7.333 (cos25.8° + j sin25.8°) ≈ 7.333 (0.9 + j0.436) ≈ 6.6 ohms + j3.2 ohms.

Now, the secondary side of the transformer is connected to this load. The secondary has impedance Z2 = 0.05 + j0.09 ohms.

So the total impedance looking into the secondary side is Z_total_secondary = Z_load + Z2 = (6.6 + 0.05) + j(3.2 + 0.09) = 6.65 + j3.29 ohms.

Now, the turns ratio a = V1/V2 = 330/220 = 1.5.

The primary impedance referred to the secondary side is Z1' = Z1 * (a)^2 = (0.24 + j0.40) * (2.25) = 0.54 + j0.9 ohms.

So the total impedance from the primary side is Z_total_primary = Z1' + Z_total_secondary = (0.54 + 6.65) + j(0.9 + 3.29) = 7.19 + j4.19 ohms.

The source voltage is 330V, so the current I1 is 330 / |Z_total_primary|.

|Z_total_primary| = sqrt(7.19² + 4.19²) ≈ sqrt(51.69 + 17.55) ≈ sqrt(69.24) ≈ 8.32 ohms.

I1 ≈ 330 / 8.32 ≈ 39.7 A.

This seems more reasonable, as it's within the transformer's rating of 2.2 kVA (2200 VA) when considering the primary current.

Now, the current in the secondary side is I2 = I1 * a = 39.7 * 1.5 ≈ 59.6 A.

Wait, but the load current is given as 30A. That suggests a discrepancy. Perhaps I'm not considering the correct relationship between I1 and I2.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the current in the secondary as I2 = I1 * (N1/N2) = I1 * 2, since N1/N2 = 2.

Wait, but earlier I used a = N1/N2 = 2, but in the autotransformer, the turns ratio is a = V1/V2 = 330/220 = 1.5.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let's try a different approach.

The load current is 30A. In the autotransformer, the current in the secondary winding is I2 = 30A. The primary current I1 is related to I2 by the turns ratio a = V1/V2 = 1.5, so I1 = I2 * (V2/V1) = 30 * (220/330) = 30 * (2/3) = 20A.

So I1 = 20A.

Now, the voltage drop in the primary winding is Vdrop1 = I1 * Z1 = 20 * (0.24 + j0.40) = 4.8 + j8.0 V.

The voltage drop in the secondary winding is Vdrop2 = I2 * Z2 = 30 * (0.05 + j0.09) = 1.5 + j2.7 V.

The total voltage drop in the transformer is Vdrop = Vdrop1 + Vdrop2 = (4.8 + 1.5) + j(8.0 + 2.7) = 6.3 + j10.7 V.

The magnitude of Vdrop is sqrt(6.3² + 10.7²) ≈ sqrt(39.69 + 114.49) ≈ sqrt(154.18) ≈ 12.41 V.

The voltage regulation is (Vdrop / V2) * 100% = (12.41 / 220) * 100 ≈ 5.64%. But looking at the options, the answers are much lower, around 0.9% to 2%. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the voltage regulation as (V1 - V2) / V2. But V1 is 330V, and V2 is 220V. So (330 - 220)/220 = 110/220 = 0.5, or 50%. But that's not matching the options either.

Wait, no. Voltage regulation is calculated as (V1 - I1 Z1 - I2 Z2) / V2.

Wait, but in this case, V1 is the source voltage, and V2 is the load voltage. So the voltage regulation is (V1 - (I1 Z1 + I2 Z2)) / V2.

From earlier, I1 = 20A, I2 = 30A.

So I1 Z1 = 20*(0.24 + j0.40) = 4.8 + j8.0 V.

I2 Z2 = 30*(0.05 + j0.09) = 1.5 + j2.7 V.

Total drop: 4.8 + 1.5 = 6.3 V (real), and 8.0 + 2.7 = 10.7 V (imaginary).

So Vdrop = 6.3 + j10.7 V.

The magnitude is sqrt(6.3² + 10.7²) ≈ 12.41 V.

So voltage regulation = (Vdrop) / V2 = 12.41 / 220 ≈ 0.0564, or 5.64%. But the options are much lower, so I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the voltage drop is calculated differently. Maybe the voltage regulation is (V1 - V2) / V2, which would be (330 - 220)/220 = 0.5 or 50%. But that's not matching the options either.

Alternatively, perhaps the voltage regulation is (V1 - I1 Z1) / V1 * 100%, but that's not the standard formula.

Wait, the standard formula for voltage regulation is:

Voltage Regulation (%) = [(V1 - V2) / V2] * 100

But V1 is the no-load voltage, and V2 is the loaded voltage. In this case, V1 is 330V, and V2 is 220V, but that would give 50%, which is not in the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the voltage regulation is the drop across the transformer's windings when the load is applied. So it's the drop caused by the load current and the magnetizing current.

But I'm getting stuck here. Let's try to proceed to calculate the efficiency.

The core loss is given as 28W. The copper losses are I1² Z1 + I2² Z2.

From earlier, I1 = 20A, I2 = 30A.

Copper loss = (20)^2 * (0.24 + j0.40) + (30)^2 * (0.05 + j0.09).

Calculating each part:

20² = 400.

400*(0.24 + j0.40) = 96 + j160 W.

30² = 900.

900*(0.05 + j0.09) = 45 + j81 W.

Total copper loss = (96 + 45) + j(160 + 81) = 141 + j241 W.

The total loss is core loss + copper loss = 28 + 141 + j241 = 169 + j241 W.

The total power input is P_input = V1 * I1 = 330 * 20 = 6600 W.

The power output is P_output = V2 * I2 = 220 * 30 = 6600 W.

Wait, but that's impossible because there are losses. So the actual power output would be P_output = 6600 - (169^2 + 241^2)^0.5.

The magnitude of the losses is sqrt(169² + 241²) ≈ sqrt(28561 + 58081) ≈ sqrt(86642) ≈ 294.38 W.

So efficiency = (P_output) / (P_input) = (6600 - 294.38) / 6600 ≈ 6305.62 / 6600 ≈ 0.955, or 95.5%. But the options for efficiency are around 0.98 to 0.99, so I'm not getting the right answer.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the copper losses. Let me re-calculate.

I1 = 20A, I2 = 30A.

Z1 = 0.24 + j0.40 ohms.

Z2 = 0.05 + j0.09 ohms.

Copper loss in primary: I1² * Z1 = 400 * (0.24 + j0.40) = 96 + j160.

Copper loss in secondary: I2² * Z2 = 900 * (0.05 + j0.09) = 45 + j81.

Total copper loss: 96+45=141 real, 160+81=241 imaginary.

So total copper loss is 141 + j241 W.

Core loss is 28W, so total loss is 141 + 28 = 169 real, and 241 imaginary. The magnitude is sqrt(169² + 241²) ≈ 294.38 W.

Total input power P_input = V1 * I1 = 330 * 20 = 6600 W.

Output power P_output = V2 * I2 = 220 * 30 = 6600 W.

So efficiency = (P_output) / (P_input) = (6600 - 294.38) / 6600 ≈ 6305.62 / 6600 ≈ 0.955, or 95.5%. But the options are much higher, around 98-99%. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the efficiency differently. The efficiency is (P_output) / (P_input + core loss + copper loss).

Wait, no, the standard formula is efficiency = (P_output) / (P_input).

But in this case, P_output = V2 * I2 = 220 * 30 = 6600 W.

P_input = V1 * I1 = 330 * 20 = 6600 W.

But the losses are 294.38 W, so P_output = P_input - losses = 6600 - 294.38 ≈ 6305.62 W.

Efficiency = 6305.62 / 6600 ≈ 0.955, or 95.5%. But the options are around 98-99%, so I'm not matching.

Wait, perhaps the current is not 20A and 30A. Let me go back.

Earlier, I assumed I1 = 20A because I1 = I2 * (V2/V1) = 30 * (220/330) = 20A. But perhaps this is incorrect because the autotransformer's current relationship is different.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the voltage drops to find the actual current.

Let me try to model the autotransformer as follows:

The primary is connected to 330V, and the secondary is connected to the load. The equivalent impedance from the primary side is Z_eq = Z1 + (Z2 * (N2/N1)^2).

As calculated earlier, Z_eq ≈ 0.2525 + j0.4225 ohms.

The current I1 = V1 / Z_eq = 330 / (0.2525 + j0.4225).

Calculating the magnitude:

|Z_eq| = sqrt(0.2525² + 0.4225²) ≈ sqrt(0.06375 + 0.1785) ≈ sqrt(0.24225) ≈ 0.492 ohms.

I1 ≈ 330 / 0.492 ≈ 670.7 A. Again, way too high.

I think I'm stuck and perhaps should look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula for voltage regulation in an autotransformer.

Voltage regulation (VR) is given by:

VR = (I1 * R1 + I2 * R2) / V2,

where R1 and R2 are the resistances of the primary and secondary windings, and I1 and I2 are the currents in those windings.

But to find I1 and I2, I need to set up the equations based on the turns ratio and the load current.

The turns ratio a = V1/V2 = 330/220 = 1.5.

The relationship between I1 and I2 is I2 = (V2 / V1) * I1 = (2/3) I1.

The total current in the primary is I1, and the current in the secondary is I2.

The voltage drops are:

V1 = I1 * (R1 + jX1) + I2 * (R2 + jX2),

where R1 and R2 are the resistances, X1 and X2 are the reactances.

But perhaps I should separate the real and imaginary parts.

Let me denote:

Z1 = R1 + jX1 = 0.24 + j0.40 ohms.

Z2 = R2 + jX2 = 0.05 + j0.09 ohms.

The equation becomes:

V1 = I1 * Z1 + I2 * Z2.

Substituting I2 = (2/3) I1:

330 = I1*(0.24 + j0.40) + (2/3 I1)*(0.05 + j0.09).

Factor out I1:

330 = I1 [ (0.24 + 0.05*(2/3)) + j(0.40 + 0.09*(2/3)) ]

Calculating the terms inside the brackets:

Real part: 0.24 + (0.05 * 0.6667) ≈ 0.24 + 0.0333 ≈ 0.2733.

Imaginary part: 0.40 + (0.09 * 0.6667) ≈ 0.40 + 0.06 ≈ 0.46.

So:

330 = I1 * (0.2733 + j0.46).

The magnitude of the impedance is sqrt(0.2733² + 0.46²) ≈ sqrt(0.0747 + 0.2116) ≈ sqrt(0.2863) ≈ 0.535 ohms.

I1 = 330 / 0.535 ≈ 617.6 A. Again, way too high.

This suggests that the approach is incorrect, possibly because the transformer's rating is exceeded, but the problem states it's used as an autotransformer, so perhaps the approach needs to account for that.

Alternatively, perhaps the autotransformer's current is split such that the total current in the primary is I1, and the current in the secondary is I2, but I'm not sure.

Given the time I've spent and the lack of progress, I'll have to make an educated guess based on the options provided. The options for voltage regulation are around 0.01 to 0.02, and efficiency around 0.98 to 0.99.

Perhaps the correct answer is option C: (a) 0.020, (b) 0.985.

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, option J: (a) 0.011, (b) 0.988.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option J, but I'm not sure.
</think>

The problem involves analyzing a two-winding transformer used as an autotransformer to supply a load at 220V from a 330V source. The transformer's parameters include a rating of 2.2 kVA, a voltage ratio of 220/110V, and impedances for windings A (220V) and B (110V) of 0.24 + j0.40 ohms and 0.05 + j0.09 ohms, respectively. The core loss is 28W, and the load current is 30A at 0.9 lagging power factor.

### Key Steps and Analysis:
1. **Autotransformer Configuration**: The transformer is used as an autotransformer to step down the voltage from 330V to 220V. The turns ratio is determined by the voltage ratio, which is 330/220 = 1.5.

2. **Equivalent Impedance Calculation**: The equivalent impedance from the primary side is calculated as:
   \[
   Z_{\text{eq}} = Z_1 + Z_2 \cdot \left(\frac{N_2}{N_1}\right)^2
   \]
   Substituting \( Z_1 = 0.24 + j0.40 \), \( Z_2 = 0.05 + j0.09 \), and \( \frac{N_2}{N_1} = \frac{1}{2} \):
   \[
   Z_{\text{eq}} = (0.24 + j0.40) + \frac{0.05 + j0.09}{4} = 0.2525 + j0.4225 \, \text{ohms}.
   \]

3. **Current Calculation**: The primary current \( I_1 \) is determined using the source voltage \( V_1 = 330 \, \text{V} \):
   \[
   I_1 = \frac{V_1}{|Z_{\text{eq}}|} = \frac{330}{\sqrt{0.2525^2 + 0.4225^2}} \approx \frac{330}{0.512} \approx 644.5 \, \text{A}.
   \]
   This current exceeds the transformer's rating, indicating a potential error in the approach.

4. **Voltage Regulation**: Voltage regulation is calculated as the voltage drop across the transformer's windings divided by the secondary voltage. However, multiple attempts to compute this yielded values inconsistent with the provided options, suggesting a misstep in modeling the autotransformer.

5. **Efficiency Calculation**: The efficiency is determined by the ratio of output power to input power, accounting for core and copper losses. However, the computed efficiency (~95.5%) does not align with the options (~98-99%), indicating an error in the approach.

### Conclusion:
Given the inconsistencies in the calculations and the provided options, the most plausible answer based on the problem setup and typical autotransformer performance is:

**Answer: J**
