Question:

A husband and his passenger were killed in an auto collision involving a defendant. The husband's wife now brings an action to recover damages for loss of society and companionship. The wife testified that she and her husband had a close relationship and that they were happily married for over 15 years. Then on cross-examination, defendant's counsel asked her if she "was aware of the affair that her husband was having with his passenger?"The wife's attorney immediately objected to this question. The judge should rule that the question is

Options:

A: objectionable, because it is irrelevant to the case at hand.
B: objectionable, because it could be seen as an attempt to tarnish the reputation of the deceased.
C: objectionable, because it was highly prejudicial.
D: unobjectionable, because plaintiff's knowledge of such an affair was probative of the value to be placed on her loss.
E: objectionable, because the question is beyond the scope of direct examination.
F: objectionable, because it infringes on the privacy of the deceased.
G: unobjectionable, because it provides a potential motive for the accident.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this legal question here. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand. 

So, the situation is that a husband and his passenger were killed in a car accident involving the defendant. The wife is suing for damages related to the loss of society and companionship. She testified that she and her husband had a close relationship and were happily married for over 15 years. Then, during cross-examination, the defendant's counsel asked her if she was aware of an affair her husband was having with the passenger. Her attorney objected, and now the judge has to rule on whether the question was objectionable.

The options are A through G, each with different reasons why the question might or might not be objectionable.

First, I need to think about the rules of evidence, specifically about what's relevant and what's not, and about the admissibility of such questions in a trial. 

So, the wife is suing for loss of society and companionship. These types of claims are usually about the emotional and sometimes financial impact of the loss. The plaintiff's state of mind and the nature of their relationship with the deceased are relevant because they help determine the value of the damages. 

The defendant's counsel is trying to bring up an affair that the husband was having. The idea might be that if the husband was having an affair, the relationship wasn't as close or loving as the wife is portraying it. If that's the case, then maybe the damages should be less because the loss wasn't as significant. 

But wait, the question is about whether the wife was aware of the affair. So the defendant is suggesting that perhaps she knew about it, which might imply that the relationship was already in trouble, affecting the value of her loss. Alternatively, the defendant might be trying to attack the wife's credibility by suggesting she was aware of something that could make her testimony about their happy marriage seem false.

In evidence law, generally, a party can be impeached by showing they lied on a material point. But here, the question is about a matter outside the scope of the direct examination. On direct, the wife testified about their relationship; on cross, the defendant is trying to dig into whether she knew about the affair. 

I'm trying to remember the rules about extrinsic evidence and whether such matters are admissible. I think that in some jurisdictions, evidence of a deceased's prior conduct can be admissible in certain cases, but it's often limited. For loss of society claims, the focus is on the surviving spouse's loss, not the deceased's behavior unless it's directly relevant to the value of the loss.

But wait, is evidence of an affair relevant to the value of the loss? If the husband was having an affair, does that mean the relationship was strained, and thus the loss of society is less? Or is that irrelevant because the value is based on the quality of the relationship regardless of external factors?

I recall that in some cases, evidence of a deceased's bad conduct, like infidelity, has been held irrelevant to the claim for loss of society because the claim is about the loss from the perspective of the survivor. The fact that the deceased was having an affair doesn't negate the loss the survivor experienced. So the defendant can't bring up the affair to reduce the damages because it's not about the deceased's worth but the relationship's worth.

Moreover, introducing such evidence can be seen as highly prejudicial. It could make the plaintiff seem at fault or less deserving, which affects the jury's empathy but doesn't really contribute to the facts at hand. The probative value (if any) is outweighed by the prejudicial effect.

Another angle is the privacy aspect. Discussing the deceased's personal life, especially intimate matters like an affair, might infringe on privacy rights. The question could be objectionable on that basis as well.

Looking at the options:

A: Objectionable because irrelevant. That's a possibility because if the affair isn't relevant to the case, then it's inadmissible. 

B: Objectionable because it could tarnish the deceased's reputation. But I think the issue here isn't about the deceased's reputation but the relevance to the claim. However, tarnishing reputation could be a reason, but I'm not sure if that's the main issue here.

C: Objectionable because highly prejudicial. This could be true, but the key is whether it's more prejudicial than probative.

D: Unobjectionable because plaintiff's knowledge is probative. If the plaintiff knew about the affair, that could affect the value of her loss. But I'm not sure if the defendant can bring that up unless it's directly relevant to the claim.

E: Objectionable because beyond the scope of direct. The question is about something not covered in direct, but cross can go beyond as long as it's relevant. So this might not be the reason.

F: Objectionable because infringes on privacy. This could be a consideration, but I'm not sure if it's the primary reason here.

G: Unobjectionable because it provides a motive. The motive here would be why the defendant caused the accident, but I'm not sure how the affair ties into that. Maybe if the passenger was involved with the husband, but that's more about the defendant's liability, not the wife's damages.

So, I think the main issue is whether the affair is relevant. If it's not, then the question is irrelevant (A). Alternatively, it's highly prejudicial and outweighs any probative value (C). 

In some cases, courts have held that evidence of infidelity is irrelevant to a loss of society claim because it doesn't affect the survivor's loss. So the defendant can't use the affair to diminish the value of the loss. Therefore, the question is irrelevant, making it objectionable under A.

But wait, another thought: if the plaintiff knew about the affair, could that affect her credibility? Like, if she testified they were happily married, but she knew about the affair, that could impeach her testimony. But in this case, the question is about whether she was aware of the affair, not about the truthfulness of her marriage statement. So maybe it's not about impeachment but about the nature of the loss.

Alternatively, if the affair existed, it might affect the value of the loss because the relationship wasn't as close as it seemed. But the defendant is asking the wife whether she knew about it. If she didn't, then it's not relevant to the loss's value. If she did, maybe it's relevant, but it's speculative.

I think the better reasoning is that the affair is irrelevant because it doesn't directly affect the loss of society claim. Therefore, the question is irrelevant, and the objection should be sustained on that basis.

The question concerns whether evidence of an affair is relevant to the wife's claim for loss of society and companionship. The key is determining if the affair affects the value of her loss. Courts generally hold that such evidence is irrelevant because the claim focuses on the survivor's loss, not the deceased's conduct. Therefore, the question is objectionable as irrelevant.
