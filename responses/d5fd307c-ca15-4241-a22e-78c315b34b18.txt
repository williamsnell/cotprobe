The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

A business purchased a computer from a seller's web site. The purchase form had a prominent hyperlink connection to a page that contained "important additional terms and conditions of sale," but the purchaser did not access that page. The delivered product included the additional terms in writing, along with a bold-lettered notice requiring the purchaser to return the product within 30 days if it did not accept the stated terms and conditions. After 35-days, the business became dissatisfied with the computer, and sued the seller for breach of contract. The seller demanded that the dispute be decided by private arbitration as per the additional terms and conditions to the agreement. Is the purchaser legally bound to participate in arbitration?

Options:

A: No, because federal law requires that a company give 90 days for return and the 30-day provision was null and void.
B: No, because there was no contract formed due to the purchaser's lack of assent to the additional terms and conditions.
C: Yes, because by not returning the computer within 30 days, the purchaser was bound to the additional terms and conditions that were a part of the contract.
D: Yes, because the seller provided the additional terms and conditions in writing with the delivered product.
E: No, because the purchaser did not explicitly agree to the terms and conditions that include private arbitration.
F: Yes, because the purchaser was aware of the additional terms and conditions, despite not accessing them.
G: No, because the seller did not clearly communicate the additional terms and conditions to the purchaser.
H: Yes, because the additional terms and conditions were part of the contract, regardless of whether the purchaser read them or not.
I: No, because the seller did not obtain explicit consent from the purchaser for the additional terms and conditions.
J: Yes, because federal law requires that arbitration must be used to attempt an initial resolution with respect to sales that take place on the internet.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this legal question about whether a business is bound to participate in arbitration because they didn't return the product within 30 days. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the scenario: A business bought a computer from a seller's website. The purchase form had a hyperlink to additional terms and conditions, but the purchaser never clicked on it. Then, the product delivered had those terms in writing, with a bold notice saying to return it within 30 days if they didn't accept the terms. After 35 days, the business sued the seller, and the seller wants to use private arbitration as per the additional terms.

The question is whether the purchaser is legally bound to arbitrate.

I remember from my studies that for a contract to be valid, there needs to be offer, acceptance, consideration, and usually, mutual assent. But when it comes to online purchases, there's also the issue of notice. If the terms are presented in a way that the user should have known about them, they might be binding even if the user didn't read them.

Here, the purchase form had a hyperlink. But the purchaser didn't access that page. However, when the product was delivered, the terms were included in writing, with a bold notice. So the terms were provided both online (hyperlink) and in the physical product.

I think about the concept of "browsewrap" agreements, where terms are available via a link, and courts usually say that just having the link isn't enough to show the user agreed to them. But here, the terms were also included with the delivered product. That might be more effective because the purchaser physically received the terms along with the product.

Now, looking at the options:

Option B says no because there was no contract formed due to lack of assent. But I think that even without explicit assent, if the terms were presented in a way that the purchaser should have known about them, they might still be part of the contract. So B might not be correct.

Option E says no because the purchaser didn't explicitly agree. But in many cases, acceptance can be through action, like not returning the product within the specified period. The terms stated that if they didn't accept, they had to return within 30 days. The purchaser kept it longer, so maybe that's acceptance by conduct.

Option H says yes because the terms were part of the contract regardless of reading. This aligns with the idea that even if you don't read them, if they were provided, they might still be part of the contract.

Option D says yes because the seller provided the terms in writing with the product. That seems relevant, but does providing them alone make them part of the contract? Or does the purchaser need to have known or accepted them?

Option I says no because there was no explicit consent. But again, sometimes acceptance can be through conduct. Since they didn't return it, maybe that's acceptance.

So putting it together, the key points are: the terms were provided both via hyperlink (which might not be enough) and in the delivered product. The purchaser didn't return it within 30 days, which could indicate acceptance. 

I think the fact that the terms were included in the delivered product, along with a bold notice, means the seller did communicate the terms effectively. When the purchaser kept the product beyond the 30-day return period, that could be seen as acceptance of the terms, including the arbitration clause. Therefore, the purchaser is bound by those terms, making the seller's demand for arbitration valid.

Looking at the options, option H says yes because the terms were part of the contract regardless of reading. That seems to fit. Alternatively, option D also says yes because the terms were provided in writing, but H is more about the contract formation regardless of reading, which seems more accurate.

So I think the correct answer is H: Yes, because the additional terms and conditions were part of the contract, regardless of whether the purchaser read them or not.
