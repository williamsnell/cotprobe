Okay, so I've got this physics problem about the Fabry-Perot etalon. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

Alright, the question says that when the pressure changes by 6.46 cm Hg, there's a shift of one fringe observed. The etalon's thickness is 1.01 cm, and it's originally under 77 cm Hg pressure. They want the index of refraction of air at room temperature and original pressure.

Hmm, I remember that the Fabry-Perot etalon produces interference patterns based on the optical path length. The formula for the optical path difference (OPD) is something like 2nd cosθ, where n is the refractive index and d is the thickness. But since the etalon is focused for infinity, I think the angle θ is small, so cosθ is approximately 1. So OPD ≈ 2nd.

Wait, but when the pressure changes, the air in the etalon is compressed or expanded. That would change the density, and thus the refractive index. The change in pressure causes a shift in the fringes because the OPD changes.

The fringe shift is related to the change in the optical path. Each fringe corresponds to a change of λ in the OPD. So a shift of one fringe implies a change in OPD of approximately λ (since each fringe is a cycle of λ/2 maybe? Wait, wait. No, wait. Wait, in interference, the condition for constructive interference is OPD = mλ, where m is an integer. So each whole fringe shift would correspond to a change of λ in OPD. But actually, wait, because the OPD is 2nd, so a shift of one fringe would mean that 2nd changes by λ.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The condition for constructive interference in an etalon is when the optical path is an integer multiple of the wavelength. So when the OPD = mλ, you get a bright spot (fringe). If the OPD changes by λ, the order m increases by 1, which shifts the fringe by one.

So, when the pressure changes, leading to a change in the refractive index, the OPD changes, causing the fringes to shift. The problem says one fringe shift occurs when the pressure changes by 6.46 cm Hg.

Wait, but wait. The pressure change is ΔP, and the thickness d is fixed. But the refractive index n depends on pressure. So the change in OPD is Δ(2nd) = 2d (Δn), because d is constant. This change should equal λ for one fringe shift.

So, 2d (n2 - n1) = λ, where n2 is the new index after pressure change, and n1 is the original.

Wait, but wait: the pressure change is ΔP = 6.46 cm Hg. So the pressure goes from P1 =77 cm Hg to P2 =77 +6.46=83.46 cm Hg? Or maybe it's a decrease, but the problem says a shift of one fringe when the pressure is changed by that amount. Hmm, but the direction might not matter for the calculation; perhaps it's the absolute change that counts.

Wait, but wait, let's think about how n varies with pressure. The refractive index of air decreases with increasing pressure because higher pressure makes the air denser, but wait, actually, wait: for gases, higher pressure at constant temperature makes the density higher, which usually increases the refractive index. Wait, but air is a mixture, and I think the refractive index of air actually decreases with increasing pressure because the molar refractivity decreases as pressure increases, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should look for the relation between n, P, and T.

Wait, the refractive index of air can be approximated using the formula n = 1 + (B * P)/(T), where B is a constant. Alternatively, using the Gladstone-Dale relation, which says that n^2 -1 = K * P / T, where K is another constant. So n depends on P and T.

In this problem, the temperature is room temperature, which I assume is constant because it's not mentioned to change. So T is constant, and thus n is proportional to P. So when pressure increases, n increases, and vice versa.

Wait, but wait, when you decrease the pressure, the density of air decreases, leading to a lower refractive index. Because n is proportional to density (for gases), as per n = (k * P)/(R T), where k is some constant. So yes, higher pressure implies higher n.

But in the problem, the pressure is changed by 6.46 cm Hg, leading to a shift of one fringe. The original pressure is 77 cm Hg. So the change in pressure is ΔP = 6.46 cm Hg. But does it matter whether it's an increase or decrease? Well, the shift is one fringe, so the change in OPD is λ, regardless of direction. But let's proceed.

So, from the fringe shift equation:

Δ(OPD) = 2 d (n2 - n1) = λ

Wait, but wait. The OPD is 2nd cosθ, but since θ is 0 (focused at infinity), cosθ=1. So OPD=2nd. The change in OPD is Δ(OPD)=2d (n2 - n1).

Set this equal to λ, because a shift of one fringe implies the OPD has changed by λ.

So 2d (n2 - n1) = λ.

Wait, but let's make sure. Suppose the original OPD is 2nd1. After the pressure change, it's 2nd2. The difference is 2d (n2 -n1). For a shift of one fringe, this difference must be λ. So yes, 2d (n2 -n1) = λ.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the sign. If the pressure increases, n increases, so (n2 -n1) is positive. Thus, the OPD increases, which would shift the fringe in a certain direction. But perhaps the absolute value is all that matters here.

So, the equation is 2d (n2 - n1) = λ.

We can rearrange this to find (n2 -n1) = λ/(2d).

But we need to find n1, the original index. Wait, but we don't know n2. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps we can model the change in n as proportional to the change in pressure, since T is constant.

From the Gladstone-Dale relation: n^2 -1 = K * P / T.

Assuming T is constant, then (n2^2 -1) - (n1^2 -1) )= K (P2 - P1)/T.

So, (n2^2 - n1^2) = K (ΔP)/T.

But K and T are constants here. So, n2^2 -n1^2 = K ΔP / T.

But I don't know K or T. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I can model n as proportional to P, since for small changes, n ≈ n1 + (dn/dP) ΔP.

Assuming n is approximately linear with P, then (n2 -n1) ≈ (dn/dP) ΔP.

So, combining this with the earlier equation: 2d (dn/dP) ΔP = λ.

So, 2d (dn/dP) ΔP = λ.

But I don't know (dn/dP), so maybe I can express (dn/dP) in terms of n1 and other constants.

Alternatively, perhaps the change in n can be approximated as dn = (n2 -n1) = (n1) (ΔP)/P1, assuming that n is proportional to P.

Wait, that might not be correct, but let me think. From the Gladstone-Dale relation, n^2 -1 = K P. If T is constant, then K is a constant. So, for two pressures P1 and P2, (n2² -1) - (n1² -1) )= K (P2 - P1).

So, n2² -n1² = K (ΔP).

But I don't know K. Alternatively, using the approximation for small pressure changes, n2 ≈ n1 + (dn/dP) ΔP.

So, let's take the derivative of n^2 -1 = K P with respect to P:

2n (dn/dP) = K.

So, dn/dP = K/(2n).

Substituting into the earlier equation:

2d (dn/dP) ΔP = λ.

So,

2d * (K/(2n)) * ΔP = λ.

Simplify:

d * (K/(n)) * ΔP = λ.

But from the Gladstone-Dale equation, K = (n² -1)/P, since at P = P1, n = n1, so K = (n1² -1)/P1.

Wait, no. Wait, K = (n² -1)/P for each pressure. So for P1, K = (n1² -1)/P1. So substituting K into the equation:

d * [(n1² -1)/P1] / n1 * ΔP = λ.

So,

d * (n1² -1)/(n1 P1) * ΔP = λ.

Hmm, that's a bit messy, but perhaps we can plug in the known values and solve for n1.

We have:

d = 1.01 cm = 1.01 cm (convert to meters? Wait, wavelength is given in Angstroms. Let's see: 5461 A° is 5461e-10 meters.

Wait, let's make sure all units are consistent. Let me list the known values:

λ = 5461 A° = 5461 × 10^-10 meters = 5.461e-7 meters.

ΔP = 6.46 cm Hg. I need to convert this to Pascals or some SI unit. Hmm, 1 cm Hg is about 1333.22 Pascals. So ΔP = 6.46 cm Hg * 1333.22 Pa/cm Hg ≈ let's compute that:

6.46 * 1333.22 ≈ let's compute:

6 * 1333.22 = 7999.32

0.46 * 1333.22 ≈ 613.26

Total ≈ 7999.32 + 613.26 = 8612.58 Pa.

So ΔP ≈ 8612.58 Pa.

P1 is the original pressure, which is 77 cm Hg. So P1 = 77 cm Hg * 1333.22 Pa/cm Hg ≈ 77 * 1333.22 ≈ let's compute:

70 * 1333.22 = 93,325.4

7 * 1333.22 ≈ 9,332.54

Total ≈ 93,325.4 + 9,332.54 = 102,657.94 Pa.

So P1 ≈ 102,658 Pa.

Now, substituting into the equation:

d * (n1² -1)/(n1 P1) * ΔP = λ.

We can plug in the numbers:

d = 1.01 cm = 0.0101 m.

Wait, wait. Wait, 1 cm is 0.01 meters, so 1.01 cm is 0.0101 m.

So,

0.0101 m * (n1² -1)/(n1 * 102,658 Pa) * 8612.58 Pa = 5.461e-7 m.

Hmm, let's compute the terms:

The Pa units will cancel out because ΔP and P1 are in Pa.

So,

0.0101 * (n1² -1)/(n1) * (8612.58 / 102658) ) = 5.461e-7.

Wait, let's compute 8612.58 / 102658 ≈ 0.0839.

So,

0.0101 * (n1² -1)/(n1) * 0.0839 ≈ 5.461e-7.

Multiply 0.0101 and 0.0839:

0.0101 * 0.0839 ≈ 0.00084739.

So,

0.00084739 * (n1² -1)/n1 ≈ 5.461e-7.

Divide both sides by 0.00084739:

(n1² -1)/n1 ≈ (5.461e-7) / 0.00084739 ≈ let's compute that.

5.461e-7 / 0.00084739 ≈ 6.447e-4.

So,

(n1² -1)/n1 ≈ 6.447e-4.

Multiply both sides by n1:

n1² -1 ≈ 6.447e-4 * n1.

Rearranging:

n1² - 6.447e-4 * n1 -1 = 0.

Wait, that can't be right because n1 is around 1, so n1² is around 1, and 6.447e-4 *n1 is about 0.0006447. So,

n1² - 0.0006447 n1 -1 ≈ 0.

Wait, that would give n1^2 - a small term -1 =0, but that would imply n1 is about sqrt(1 + 0.0006447) ≈ 1 + 0.00032235, which is about 1.000322.

But wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check the calculations again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier steps. Let me go back.

The equation after substituting all values:

0.0101 * (n1² -1)/(n1 * 102658) * 8612.58 = 5.461e-7.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the constants more accurately.

Let me compute 8612.58 / 102658:

8612.58 ÷ 102658 ≈ 0.0839.

Yes, that's correct.

So,

0.0101 * (n1² -1)/(n1) * 0.0839 = 5.461e-7.

Compute 0.0101 * 0.0839:

0.0101 * 0.0839 ≈ 0.00084739.

So,

0.00084739 * (n1² -1)/n1 = 5.461e-7.

Divide both sides by 0.00084739:

(n1² -1)/n1 ≈ (5.461e-7) / 0.00084739 ≈ 6.447e-4.

So,

n1² -1 ≈ 6.447e-4 * n1.

Which gives:

n1² - 6.447e-4 n1 -1 = 0.

Wait, but that would be a quadratic equation: n1² - (6.447e-4) n1 -1 = 0.

The solution would be n1 = [6.447e-4 ± sqrt( (6.447e-4)^2 + 4 ) ] / 2.

Hmm, let's compute the discriminant:

(6.447e-4)^2 = approx 4.156e-7.

So,

sqrt(4.156e-7 + 4) = sqrt(4.0004156e0) ≈ 2.0001039.

So,

n1 = [6.447e-4 + 2.0001039]/2 ≈ (2.00074839)/2 ≈ 1.000374.

Wait, but that would make n1 around 1.000374. But looking at the options, option H is 1.000323 and option F is 1.000565. So perhaps this is the value.

Wait, but I'm not sure if this approach is correct. Another approach might be to model n as being proportional to pressure, which would make the change in n small.

Wait, perhaps I should use the approximation that (n2 -n1) ≈ (n1) (ΔP)/P1.

If n is proportional to P, then n = k P, where k is a constant. So, n2 = k P2, n1 =k P1. So, n2 -n1 =k (P2-P1) =k ΔP.

But from the fringe equation, 2d (n2-n1) = λ.

So,

2d k ΔP = λ.

But from the Gladstone-Dale relation, n = sqrt(1 + (K P)/T).

Assuming small n-1, we can approximate n ≈ 1 + (K P)/(2 T).

So, K is a constant that depends on the gas. For air, K is approximately 0.0372 cm^2/(g·K). But perhaps I can find a better way.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for the refractive index of air as a function of pressure and temperature. The refractive index n of air can be approximated as n = 1 + 0.000296 * (P/(P0)) * (T0/T), where P0 is standard atmospheric pressure (101325 Pa), T0 is standard temperature (273.15 K), and P is the pressure in Pascals, T is the temperature in Kelvin.

Wait, but in this problem, the temperature is room temperature, which is roughly 293 K. So let's assume T = 293 K.

So,

n = 1 + 0.000296 * (P / P0) * (273.15 / 293).

Wait, but let me check if I have the formula correctly. Another source says n = 1 + 0.000296 * (P / P0) * (T0 / T). So with P0=1 atm, T0=273 K, and T=293 K.

So,

n = 1 + 0.000296 * (P / 101325) * (273 / 293).

But I'm not sure about the exact coefficients, but perhaps for the sake of this problem, I can use this approximation.

So, at P1 =77 cm Hg, which is 102658 Pa, as calculated earlier.

n1 = 1 + 0.000296 * (102658 / 101325) * (273/293).

Compute (102658 / 101325) ≈ 1.013.

(273/293) ≈ 0.9316.

So,

n1 ≈ 1 + 0.000296 * 1.013 * 0.9316.

Compute 0.000296 * 1.013 ≈ 0.0002996.

Multiply by 0.9316: 0.0002996 *0.9316 ≈ 0.0002793.

So,

n1 ≈ 1 + 0.0002793 ≈ 1.0002793.

Hmm, that's about 1.000279. But the options given don't have this exact value. Let's look at the options:

A: 0.99789
B: 1.00445
C: 1.00323
D: 0.99865
E: 0.999877
F: 1.000565
G: 1.00211
H: 1.000323
I: 1.00187

Hmm, 1.000279 is close to option H:1.000323.

But wait, perhaps the formula I used is an approximation, and maybe the actual value is a bit higher.

Alternatively, perhaps I should go back to the earlier approach with the quadratic equation, which gave n1≈1.000374, which is closer to option F (1.000565) but not exactly matching.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier quadratic approach.

Let me double-check.

We had:

(n1² -1)/n1 ≈6.447e-4.

Which gives n1² -1 ≈6.447e-4 *n1.

So,

n1² -6.447e-4 *n1 -1=0.

Using the quadratic formula:

n1 = [6.447e-4 ± sqrt( (6.447e-4)^2 +4 ) ] / 2.

Compute (6.447e-4)^2 = approx 4.156e-7.

So sqrt(4.156e-7 +4) = sqrt(4.0000004156) ≈ 2.0000001039.

So,

n1 = [6.447e-4 + 2.0000001039]/2 ≈ (2.0006447)/2 ≈ 1.00032235.

Ah! So n1 is approximately 1.000322, which matches option H:1.000323.

So that's probably the correct answer.

Wait, but let me make sure. Let me plug this value back into the equation to see if it works.

n1 = 1.00032235.

Compute (n1^2 -1)/n1:

n1^2 = (1.00032235)^2 ≈ 1 + 2*0.00032235 + (0.00032235)^2 ≈ 1.0006447.

So,

(n1^2 -1) = 0.0006447.

Divide by n1: 0.0006447 / 1.00032235 ≈ 0.0006445.

Which is approximately 6.445e-4, which matches our earlier calculation of 6.447e-4. Close enough, considering rounding errors.

So the index of refraction is approximately 1.000322, which is option H:1.000323.
</think>

To solve the problem, we analyze the fringe shift caused by a pressure change in the Fabry-Perot etalon. The fringe shift corresponds to a change in the optical path difference (OPD) equal to the wavelength, λ. The OPD is given by \( \text{OPD} = 2nd \), where \( n \) is the refractive index of air and \( d \) is the thickness of the etalon. A pressure change \( \Delta P \) causes a change in \( n \), leading to a shift in the OPD.

Using the relation \( 2d \Delta n = \lambda \), where \( \Delta n = n_2 - n_1 \), we substitute \( \Delta n \) using the Gladstone-Dale relation, \( n^2 - 1 = K \frac{P}{T} \), assuming \( T \) is constant. This gives \( \Delta n \approx \frac{K \Delta P}{T} \). Substituting into the OPD equation, we find:

\[
2d \left( \frac{K \Delta P}{T} \right) = \lambda
\]

Rewriting \( K \) in terms of \( n \) and \( P \), we solve for \( n_1 \), the refractive index at the original pressure. After substituting the given values (\( \lambda = 5461 \, \text{Å} \), \( d = 1.01 \, \text{cm} \), \( \Delta P = 6.46 \, \text{cm Hg} \), and \( P_1 = 77 \, \text{cm Hg} \)), we derive a quadratic equation for \( n_1 \). Solving this yields \( n_1 \approx 1.000322 \), which matches option H.
