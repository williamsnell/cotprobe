Question:

Lizette and her family watch the sunset over the ocean. While walking home in the increasing darkness, Lizette notices that she can no longer distinguish the colors of objects. Which of the following best explains why Lizette cannot see color in dim light?

Options:

A: Lizette's eyes are adjusting to the darkness, hence she cannot distinguish the colors of objects.
B: Cones, which are specialized for color vision, require more light to be activated, whereas rods, which produce images in black, white, and gray, allow for vision in dim light.
C: The retina does not respond to changes in light intensity, therefore colors are not visible in dim light.
D: The receptive fields in the retina respond to the loss of light through light adaptation, the process of rapidly adjusting to a diminution of light.
E: Cones, which are specialized for black and white vision, require a small amount of light to be activated, whereas rods, which produce images in color, require greater amounts of light for vision.
F: Rods and cones both require a high amount of light to be activated, hence color vision is not possible in dim light.
G: The cones, which are responsible for color vision, are deactivated in dim light.
H: The color vision is not possible in the dark because the photoreceptor cells in the retina require light to detect colors.
I: The colors are not visible in dim light because the rods, which detect colors, are deactivated.
J: Rods, which are specialized for color vision, require more light to be activated, whereas cones, which produce images in black, white, and gray, allow for vision in dim light.

Okay, so I'm trying to answer this question about why Lizette can't see colors in dim light. Let me think through it step by step. 

I remember that human eyes have photoreceptor cells called rods and cones. Cones are responsible for color vision, and rods are more sensitive to low light. So in bright conditions, cones are active, allowing us to see colors. But when it's dim, rods take over, but they don't detect color, which is why we can't see colors as well in the dark.

Looking at the options, option A says her eyes are adjusting to the darkness, so she can't see colors. That might be part of it, but I think it's more about the type of cells active. Option B says cones require more light and rods allow dim light but only in black and white. That sounds right because cones need more light to function, and rods work better in low light but don't handle color.

Option C says the retina doesn't respond to light changes, which doesn't make sense because the retina definitely adjusts. Option D talks about receptive fields and light adaptation, which is about adjusting to less light quickly, but it's not directly explaining why color isn't seen. Option E is the opposite; it says cones handle black and white, which is wrong because cones are for color. Rods in E are for color, which is incorrect.

Option F says both rods and cones need a lot of light, which isn't true because rods work in low light. Option G says cones are deactivated in dim light, which isn't exactly right; they're just less active because rods are taking over. Option H says photoreceptors need light for color, but that's a given and doesn't explain why color is lost in dimness. Option I says rods detect colors, which is wrong because cones do. Option J is the opposite of B, saying rods are for color, which is incorrect.

So the correct explanation is that cones require more light and rods allow dim light without color. That matches option B.

The correct answer is B: Cones, which are specialized for color vision, require more light to be activated, whereas rods, which produce images in black, white, and gray, allow for vision in dim light.

Answer: B
