This question refers to the following information.
"MAHATMA GANDHI'S MESSAGE.
REMAIN NON-VIOLENT
The following message was sent by Mahatma Gandhi from Waltair:—
Maulana Mohamed AH was arrested at Waltair under sections 107 and 108 to be called upon to give security, to be of good behaviour for one year. The place and date of trial is unknown.
The Begum Saheba and Mr. Hayat were permitted to see him after arrest.
He and I were going to address a meeting outside the station. He was arrested. I continued going to the meeting and addressed them. There is no cause for sorrow, but every cause for congratulation. There should be no hartal. Perfect peace and calmness should be observed. I regard the arrest as a prelude to Swaraj and the redress of the Khilafat and the Punjab wrongs, if we can remain non-violent. Retain Hindu-Muslim Unity despite the madness of some Moplahs, and fulfil the Swadeshi programme.
I hope every Indian, man or woman, will completely boycott foreign cloth and take up spinning or weaving during every spare minute.
By striving like the Maulana, be insistent on religious and national rights.
Let us earn imprisonment. I am conscious of the Maulana's innocence and I am sure the imprisonment of the innocent will enable the nation to reach the cherished goal."
Mohandas Gandhi, The Pilgrims' March, 1921

Alright, so I'm trying to figure out which historical development was most likely inspired by Mahatma Gandhi's instructions to remain nonviolent in the fourth paragraph of his message. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll read the question again to make sure I understand it correctly. The question is asking about the historical development that was inspired by Gandhi's emphasis on nonviolence. The options given are A to D, each representing a different movement.

Looking at the passage, Gandhi is talking about remaining nonviolent, addressing a meeting after the arrest of Maulana Mohamed AH, and mentions Swaraj, which I know is related to the concept of self-rule in India. He also talks about Hindu-Muslim unity and the Swadeshi programme, which promotes local industries and boycotts of foreign goods.

Now, considering the options:

A: The Zionist movement creating Israel. That's a national movement for Jews, primarily in the 20th century. I don't think nonviolence was a key part of their approach, as the Zionist movement was more about establishing a state through various means, including conflict with existing powers.

B: Independence movements in Southeast Asia. These include countries like Indonesia, Philippines, etc. While many independence movements used various strategies, some were nonviolent, but I'm not sure if they were directly inspired by Gandhi's methods. However, Gandhi's influence was significant in many independence movements, especially in India.

C: The civil rights movements in the US, particularly the African American civil rights movement. This movement was heavily influenced by Gandhi's philosophy of nonviolence. Leaders like Martin Luther King Jr. explicitly cited Gandhi as an influence. So this seems like a strong contender.

D: The communist movement in Cuba leading to a change in government. This is more about revolution through armed struggle, which is the opposite of nonviolence. Che Guevara and Fidel Castro's methods were more about armed起义 rather than nonviolent resistance.

So, the passage is from 1921, during Gandhi's leadership in India's independence movement. The message talks about nonviolence and Swaraj, which directly ties into India's struggle for independence from British rule. However, the options given are about other historical developments, so I need to see which of these movements were influenced by Gandhi's nonviolence.

Option C, the civil rights movement in the US, is a well-known example of nonviolent resistance inspired by Gandhi. The other movements either didn't use nonviolence as their primary method or weren't directly inspired by Gandhi. 

Wait, but the question is about the instructions in the fourth paragraph. Let me check the passage again. The fourth paragraph says, "There should be no hartal. Perfect peace and calmness should be observed. I regard the arrest as a prelude to Swaraj..." So, he's emphasizing nonviolence and peace.

Given that, the civil rights movement in the US was indeed inspired by Gandhi's nonviolent methods. So the answer should be C.

Alternatively, could it be B? Some Southeast Asian movements did use nonviolence, but I'm not sure if they were directly inspired by Gandhi. The civil rights movement in the US is a more direct example because MLK specifically mentioned Gandhi.

So, I think the correct answer is C.

The historical development most likely inspired by Gandhi's emphasis on nonviolence is the civil rights movements in the United States, particularly the African American civil rights movement, which was influenced by Gandhi's philosophy.

Answer: C
