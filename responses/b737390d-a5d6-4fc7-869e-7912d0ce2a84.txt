Question:

A skier is filmed by a motion-picture photographer who notices him traveling down a ski run. The skier travels 36 ft during the fourth second of the filming and 48 ft during the sixth second. What distance did he cover in the eight seconds of filming? Assume that the acceleration is uniform throughout.

Options:

A: 350 ft
B: 280 ft
C: 300 ft
D: 312 ft
E: 288 ft
F: 420 ft
G: 324 ft
H: 256 ft
I: 368 ft
J: 400 ft

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a skier being filmed, and I need to figure out how far he traveled in eight seconds. Hmm, let's see. I remember that when dealing with uniform acceleration, we can use the equations of motion. Uniform acceleration means the skier is either speeding up or slowing down at a constant rate, right?

The problem says the skier travels 36 feet during the fourth second and 48 feet during the sixth second. Wait, so that's not the total distance up to those seconds, but the distance he covered specifically in the fourth second and the sixth second. Oh, right, that's the key here. So I need to find the acceleration and initial velocity first.

I think the formula for the distance traveled in a specific second is something like s = ut + 0.5*a*t², but since it's the distance in the nth second, maybe I should use the formula for the nth term. Let me recall: the distance in the nth second is equal to the average of the velocities at the start and end of that second. Or maybe it's the difference in position between the end of the (n-1)th second and the nth second.

Wait, yes, the distance traveled during the nth second is s_n = s(n) - s(n-1), where s(n) is the total distance after n seconds, and s(n-1) is after (n-1) seconds. So s(n) = u*t + 0.5*a*t², and s(n-1) would be u*(t-1) + 0.5*a*(t-1)². So the distance during the nth second is s(n) - s(n-1).

Let me write that out. For the fourth second, n=4, so s_4 = s(4) - s(3). Similarly, for the sixth second, s_6 = s(6) - s(5). 

But maybe there's a formula that directly gives the distance for the nth second. I think it's s_n = u + 0.5*a*(2n - 1). Let me check that. Because when you expand s(n) - s(n-1), it's [u*n + 0.5*a*n²] - [u*(n-1) + 0.5*a*(n-1)²]. Let's compute that:

s(n) - s(n-1) = u*n + 0.5 a n² - u(n-1) - 0.5 a (n² - 2n +1)
= u [n - (n-1)] + 0.5 a [n² - (n² -2n +1)]
= u(1) + 0.5 a (2n -1)
= u + a n - 0.5 a
= u + a (n - 0.5)

Hmm, so s_n = u + a (n - 0.5). So that's the formula for the distance traveled in the nth second.

So for n=4, s_4 = u + a (4 - 0.5) = u + 3.5 a = 36 ft.

For n=6, s_6 = u + a (6 - 0.5) = u +5.5 a =48 ft.

So now I have two equations:

1) u + 3.5 a = 36
2) u +5.5 a =48

I can subtract equation 1 from equation 2 to eliminate u.

( u +5.5a ) - (u +3.5a ) =48 -36
(5.5a -3.5a) =12
2a=12 → a=6 ft/s²

Now that I have a=6, I can plug back into equation 1 to find u.

u +3.5*6 =36 → u +21=36 → u=15 ft/s.

So initial velocity u is 15 ft/s, and acceleration a is 6 ft/s².

Now the question asks for the total distance covered in eight seconds. So I need to calculate s(8), which is the total distance after 8 seconds.

The formula is s = ut + 0.5 a t².

Plugging in the values:

s(8)=15*8 +0.5*6*(8)^2.

Calculate each part:

15*8 =120.

0.5*6=3, and 8²=64. So 3*64=192.

Adding them together: 120 +192=312 ft.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations. 15*8 is indeed 120. 0.5*6 is 3, and 3*64 is 192. 120+192 is 312. So the total distance after 8 seconds is 312 feet.

Looking at the options, option D is 312 ft. So the answer should be D.

The skier's motion is analyzed using the equations of uniformly accelerated motion. The distance traveled during specific seconds is used to set up equations for initial velocity and acceleration. Solving these yields an initial velocity of 15 ft/s and acceleration of 6 ft/s². The total distance after 8 seconds is calculated using the kinematic equation, resulting in 312 feet.

Answer: D
