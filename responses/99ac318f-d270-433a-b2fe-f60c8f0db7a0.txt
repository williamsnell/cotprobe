Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Challenger space shuttle and a cesium clock experiment. Hmm, I remember that this has to do with time dilation, either from special relativity or general relativity. Let me try to break it down.

The question says that in 1985, the Challenger flew a cesium clock and compared it with a fixed clock on Earth. The shuttle was orbiting at about 330 km above Earth with a speed of 7712 m/s. I need to calculate the expected time lost per second for the moving clock. The measured result was -295.02 ±0.29 ps/s, and this includes a predicted GR effect of 35.0 ±0.06 ps/s. So, the options are A through J, and I have to pick the correct one.

First, I think I should consider both special relativity (SR) and general relativity (GR) effects because the problem mentions both. SR deals with time dilation due to relative velocity, while GR deals with gravitational time dilation.

Let me outline the steps:

1. **Special Relativity (SR) Time Dilation**: The moving clock (on the shuttle) will tick slower compared to the stationary clock on Earth. The formula for this is:
   Δt' = Δt * sqrt(1 - v²/c²)
   But since we're looking for the rate at which time is lost per second, I think we'll calculate the factor gamma, which is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²), and then find how much time is lost per second. Alternatively, the time dilation factor is sqrt(1 - v²/c²), so the rate of the moving clock relative to the stationary one is that factor.

2. **General Relativity (GR) Time Dilation**: The shuttle is in a stronger gravitational field because it's closer to Earth. Wait, no—wait, actually, when you're higher up, the gravitational potential is lower (more negative), so clocks run slower. Or wait, no, in GR, clocks closer to a massive object (like Earth) run slower. So the shuttle is higher, so its gravitational potential is less negative than on Earth's surface, which means its clock should run faster. But wait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me think again. The gravitational time dilation formula is:
   Δt' = Δt * sqrt(1 + 2Φ/c²)
   where Φ is the gravitational potential. On Earth's surface, Φ is about -3.986×10^8 m²/s². The shuttle is at 330 km altitude, so I need to calculate Φ at that point. The gravitational potential Φ at a distance r from Earth's center is -G*M_Earth / r.

Wait, actually, the formula for gravitational potential is Φ = - (G*M)/r. So at Earth's surface, r is the Earth's radius, R_earth ≈ 6.371×10^6 meters. The shuttle is at 330 km above Earth's surface, so r = R_earth + 330,000 meters = 6,371,000 + 330,000 = 6,701,000 meters.

I think the time dilation due to GR would be the difference in gravitational potential between the shuttle and Earth. So the shuttle's clock runs faster because it's in a weaker gravitational field (higher up). So the GR effect would cause the shuttle clock to tick faster, meaning it gains time, but since the measured effect is negative, perhaps I need to be careful with the signs.

Wait, but the measured result includes a GR effect of +35.0 ps/s. Wait, in the problem statement, the measured result is -295.02 ps/s, which includes a predicted GR effect of +35.0 ps/s. So the total measured effect is the sum of SR and GR effects. So perhaps the SR effect is negative (time lost) and GR is positive (time gained), and their sum is the measured value.

Wait, let me get this straight. The problem states that the measured result is -295.02 ps/s, which includes a GR effect of +35.0 ps/s. That suggests that the SR effect is more negative than the GR effect is positive, so the total is negative.

So, I need to compute both effects, add them, and see which option matches.

Let me start with the SR effect. The formula for time dilation in SR is that the moving clock (shuttle) runs slower. So the rate at which time passes for the shuttle relative to Earth is sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

The speed v is 7712 m/s. Let's compute v²:

v² = (7712)^2 = let's calculate that. 7712 * 7712. Let me approximate: 7700^2 is 59,290,000. 7712^2 is (7700 + 12)^2 = 7700² + 2*7700*12 + 12² = 59,290,000 + 184,800 + 144 = 59,474,944 m²/s².

The speed of light c is approximately 2.99792458e8 m/s. So c² is (2.99792458e8)^2 ≈ (3e8)^2 = 9e16 m²/s², but more accurately, it's about 8.987551787e16 m²/s².

So v²/c² = 59,474,944 / 8.987551787e16 ≈ let's compute that.

First, 59,474,944 is 5.9474944e7.

Divide that by 8.987551787e16:

5.9474944e7 / 8.987551787e16 ≈ (5.9474944 /8.987551787) * 1e-9 ≈ approximately 0.6617 * 1e-9 = 6.617e-10.

Wait, wait, that can't be right. Wait, 5.947e7 divided by 8.987e16 is approximately 6.617e-10. Because 5.947 /8.987 is about 0.6617, and then 1e7 /1e16 is 1e-9, so 0.6617e-9 = 6.617e-10.

So sqrt(1 - v²/c²) ≈ sqrt(1 - 6.617e-10) ≈ 1 - (1/2)(6.617e-10) because for small x, sqrt(1-x) ≈ 1 - x/2.

So the SR time dilation factor is approximately 1 - 3.3085e-10.

This means that each second on Earth corresponds to approximately 1 / (1 - 3.3085e-10) seconds on the shuttle. Wait, no, wait: from Earth's frame, the shuttle's clock runs slower. So the time lost per second would be (1 - sqrt(1 - v²/c²)) per second.

Wait, the time dilation formula is that the moving clock runs slower. So the rate of the moving clock is sqrt(1 - v²/c²) times the stationary clock. So the time lost per second is (1 - sqrt(1 - v²/c²)) per second.

Wait, but sqrt(1 - x) ≈ 1 - x/2 for small x. So 1 - sqrt(1 - x) ≈ x/2.

So the SR time dilation effect would be approximately (v²)/(2c²) per second.

Plugging in the numbers:

v² = (7712)^2 = 59,474,944 m²/s².

c² = (2.99792458e8)^2 ≈ 8.987551787e16 m²/s².

So v²/(2c²) = 59,474,944 / (2 * 8.987551787e16) = 59,474,944 / 1.797510357e17 ≈ approx 3.308e-10.

Wait, but wait, that's per second. So the time lost per second due to SR would be approximately 3.308e-10 seconds per second, which is 0.3308 ps/s (since 1e-12 seconds is 1 picosecond, so 3.308e-10 s = 330.8e-12 s = 330.8 ps/s).

Wait, but that's a positive number. But in the problem, the measured result is negative. Hmm. Wait, perhaps I'm getting the sign wrong.

Wait, the SR effect causes the moving clock to lose time, meaning it ticks slower. So from Earth's perspective, the shuttle's clock is running slower by about 330.8 ps/s. So the shuttle loses time compared to Earth. So the SR effect is about +330.8 ps/s loss.

But wait, the problem states that the measured result is -295.02 ps/s, which includes a GR effect of +35.0 ps/s. So perhaps the total measured effect is the sum of SR and GR effects. Let me think.

Wait, in GR, being higher up (less gravitational potential) means that the clock runs faster. So the GR effect would cause the shuttle's clock to gain time compared to Earth. So the GR effect is positive in the sense that the shuttle's clock runs faster. So if the SR effect causes a loss (negative), and GR causes a gain (positive), the total would be the sum.

So, let me compute both effects.

First, the SR effect: time lost per second due to SR is approximately 330.8 ps/s (as calculated above), so that's a loss, so negative? Or positive?

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the total time dilation. The total time dilation rate (from both SR and GR) would be the sum of SR and GR effects.

So, the SR effect (from velocity) causes the shuttle clock to slow down, so the time lost per second is (gamma - 1) per second, where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Alternatively, the time lost per second is (v²)/(2c²) ≈ 3.308e-10 s/s = 330.8 ps/s.

The GR effect is due to the gravitational potential. The formula for gravitational time dilation is:

Δt' = Δt * sqrt(1 + 2Φ/c²)

where Φ is the gravitational potential. On Earth's surface, Φ is about -3.986e8 m²/s². At the shuttle's altitude, Φ is less negative, so the sqrt term is larger, meaning the shuttle's clock runs faster.

The difference in Φ between the shuttle and Earth is Φ_shuttle - Φ_earth. Wait, Φ_earth is more negative, so Φ_shuttle is higher (less negative). So the change in Φ would be ΔΦ = Φ_shuttle - Φ_earth = (-3.986e8 / (R_earth + h)) ) - (-3.986e8 / R_earth) )

Wait, alternatively, the gravitational potential at a height h above Earth's surface is given by Φ = - (G M_e) / (R_e + h), where R_e is Earth's radius, M_e is Earth's mass, and h is the altitude.

So, the gravitational potential at shuttle's altitude is Φ_shuttle = - (G M_e) / (R_e + h)

And on Earth's surface, Φ_earth = - (G M_e) / R_e.

The difference in Φ is ΔΦ = Φ_shuttle - Φ_earth = [ -G M_e / (R_e + h) ] - [ - G M_e / R_e ] = G M_e [ 1/R_e - 1/(R_e + h) ]

Which simplifies to G M_e [ (R_e + h - R_e) / (R_e (R_e + h)) ) ] = G M_e [ h / (R_e (R_e + h)) ) ]

So, the time dilation factor due to GR is (ΔΦ)/(c²) = [ G M_e h ] / [ c² R_e (R_e + h) ) ]

This is approximately, for h << R_e, (G M_e h) / (c² R_e²) ) ≈ (h / R_e²) * (G M_e / c² )

But let me compute it more accurately.

Given:

G = 6.67430e-11 m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻²

M_e = 5.972e24 kg

R_e = 6.371e6 meters

h = 330 km = 3.3e5 meters

So, R_e + h = 6.371e6 + 3.3e5 = 6.701e6 meters.

Compute ΔΦ:

ΔΦ = G M_e [ h / (R_e (R_e + h)) ]

Plugging the numbers:

G M_e = 6.6743e-11 * 5.972e24 ≈ let's calculate that.

6.6743e-11 * 5.972e24 = (6.6743 *5.972) e13 ≈ 39.86e13 = 3.986e14 m³/s².

Wait, that's the value of G M_e, which is often denoted as μ (mu), the Earth's gravitational parameter. So μ ≈ 3.986e14 m³/s².

So, ΔΦ = μ * h / [ R_e (R_e + h) ]

h = 3.3e5 m

R_e = 6.371e6 m

R_e + h = 6.701e6 m

So,

ΔΦ = 3.986e14 * 3.3e5 / (6.371e6 * 6.701e6 )

Let me compute the denominator: 6.371e6 * 6.701e6 ≈ (6.371 *6.701) e12 ≈ approx (42.66) e12 = 4.266e13 m².

Now, numerator: 3.986e14 * 3.3e5 ≈ (3.986 *3.3) e19 ≈ 13.1538e19 = 1.31538e20.

So ΔΦ ≈ 1.31538e20 / 4.266e13 ≈ 1.31538 / 4.266 * 1e7 ≈ approx 0.3085 * 1e7 = 3.085e6 m²/s².

Wait, but that can't be right because Φ is in m²/s², and the units here seem to be correct because ΔΦ has units of (m³/s²) * m / (m²) ) = m/s², but wait, no, I think I made a mistake in units.

Wait, let me check the units again. μ has units m³/s², h is m, denominator is m², so overall, μ * h is m^4/s², divided by m² gives m²/s², which is correct for Φ.

So, ΔΦ ≈ 3.085e6 m²/s².

But wait, the time dilation factor is ΔΦ / c², so:

ΔΦ / c² = 3.085e6 / (9e16) ≈ 3.428e-11 s.

Wait, but that's per second? Or per what?

Wait, the formula I'm using is the approximation for the time dilation rate, which is (ΔΦ)/(c²) per second. So the GR effect is (ΔΦ)/(c²) per second.

So, (3.085e6 m²/s²) / (9e16 m²/s²) ) = 3.085e6 /9e16 ≈ 3.428e-11 s/s = 34.28e-12 s/s = 34.28 ps/s.

Wait, that's about 34.28 ps/s. Since the shuttle is higher, its clock runs faster, so the GR effect is positive, meaning the shuttle gains time compared to Earth. So the GR effect is +34.28 ps/s.

Wait, but the problem states that the GR effect is 35.0 ±0.06 ps/s. So my calculation is close to that, which makes sense.

Now, the SR effect is about 330.8 ps/s (time lost, so negative), and the GR effect is about +34.28 ps/s (time gained, so positive). So the total effect is 330.8 -34.28 ≈ 296.52 ps/s.

Wait, but the measured result is -295.02 ps/s. So that's quite close. But my calculation gives approximately 296.52 ps/s, which is close to 295.02.

Wait, but the options don't have 295.02 as the correct answer, but option G is 295.02. But wait, the problem says that the measured result includes the GR effect of 35.0 ps/s, so perhaps the question is asking for the expected time lost, which would be the SR effect minus the GR effect.

Wait, but in the problem, the measured result is -295.02 ps/s, which includes the GR effect. So the expected time lost (without considering GR) would be just the SR effect. But the question says to calculate the expected time lost per second for the moving clock, which includes both SR and GR effects. Wait, no, the problem says to calculate the expected time lost, which I think is the SR effect, and then compare with the measured result which includes both.

Wait, the question says: "Calculate the expected time lost per second (in picoseconds) for the moving clock and compare with the measured result of -295.02 ±0.29 ps/s, which includes a predicted effect due to general Relativity of 35.0 ±0.06 ps/s"

So the expected time lost is the SR effect, which is about 330.8 ps/s, and the measured includes both SR and GR, which is -295.02 ps/s, which is the SR effect minus the GR effect (SR: -330.8, GR: +34.28, so total is -296.52, which is close to the measured -295.02).

But the question is asking for the expected time lost, which is the SR effect, so 330.8 ps/s. But looking at the options, option G is 295.02, which is close to the measured value, which includes both effects. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the total time dilation effect (SR and GR), which would be SR effect (time lost) minus GR effect (time gained), so 330.8 -34.28 ≈ 296.52 ps/s, which is about 295.02 as in option G.

Wait, but the measured result is -295.02 ps/s, which includes both effects. So the expected time lost is the SR effect, which is 330.8 ps/s, but the measured includes GR, which reduces the time lost by 34.28 ps/s, leading to 296.52 ps/s, which is close to the measured value.

But the options don't have 296.52; option G is 295.02, which is very close. So perhaps the correct answer is G: 295.02.

Wait, but in my earlier calculation, the SR effect was 330.8 ps/s, and GR effect was 34.28 ps/s. So 330.8 -34.28 = 296.52, which is close to 295.02. So perhaps the correct answer is G.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the SR effect. Let me double-check.

Wait, the SR time dilation factor is sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let me compute that more accurately.

v =7712 m/s.

v² =7712^2 = let's compute 7700^2 = 59,290,000, plus 2*7700*12 = 184,800, plus 12^2=144, so total v²=59,290,000 + 184,800 +144 =59,474,944 m²/s².

c² = (2.99792458e8)^2 = approx 8.987551787e16 m²/s².

v²/c² =59,474,944 /8.987551787e16 ≈ let's compute this as a decimal.

59,474,944 is 5.9474944e7.

5.9474944e7 /8.987551787e16 = (5.9474944 /8.987551787) * 1e-9 ≈ 0.6617 * 1e-9 =6.617e-10.

So 1 - v²/c² = 1 -6.617e-10 ≈ 0.9999999993383.

sqrt(0.9999999993383) ≈ using the approximation sqrt(1 - x) ≈ 1 - x/2 - x²/8.

x=6.617e-10.

So sqrt ≈ 1 - (6.617e-10)/2 ≈ 1 - 3.3085e-10.

So the SR factor is 1 -3.3085e-10.

So the time lost per second is (1 - (1 -3.3085e-10)) =3.3085e-10 s/s = 330.85e-12 s/s = 330.85 ps/s.

Wait, that's about 330.85 ps/s, which is the SR effect.

Now, the GR effect is (ΔΦ)/c² =3.085e6 /9e16 =3.428e-11 s/s =34.28 ps/s.

So the total time dilation is SR effect minus GR effect: 330.85 -34.28 ≈ 296.57 ps/s.

The measured result is -295.02 ps/s, which includes GR. So our calculation (296.57) is very close to the measured -295.02. So the expected time lost (including both effects) is approximately 296.57, which rounds to about 295.02, matching option G.

Wait, but the options are A:275.98, B:160.34, C:220.45, D:330.76, E:450.29, F:400.12, G:295.02, H:200.50, I:365.44, J:310.87.

So option G is 295.02, which matches the calculated value. Therefore, the correct answer should be G.
</think>

To calculate the expected time lost per second for the moving clock on the Challenger space shuttle, we consider both special relativity (SR) and general relativity (GR) effects.

### Special Relativity (SR) Time Dilation
The SR time dilation factor is given by:
\[
\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}
\]
where \(v = 7712 \, \text{m/s}\) is the orbital speed of the shuttle, and \(c = 2.99792458 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}\) is the speed of light.

1. Compute \(v^2\):
   \[
   v^2 = 7712^2 = 59,474,944 \, \text{m}^2/\text{s}^2
   \]

2. Compute \(v^2/c^2\):
   \[
   \frac{v^2}{c^2} = \frac{59,474,944}{8.987551787 \times 10^{16}} \approx 6.617 \times 10^{-10}
   \]

3. The time dilation factor is:
   \[
   \sqrt{1 - 6.617 \times 10^{-10}} \approx 1 - \frac{6.617 \times 10^{-10}}{2} = 1 - 3.3085 \times 10^{-10}
   \]

4. The time lost per second due to SR is:
   \[
   \Delta t_{\text{SR}} = 1 - \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}} \approx 3.3085 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{s/s} = 330.85 \, \text{ps/s}
   \]

### General Relativity (GR) Time Dilation
The GR time dilation effect arises due to the difference in gravitational potential between the shuttle and Earth. The gravitational potential at a distance \(r\) from Earth's center is:
\[
\Phi = -\frac{G M_{\text{Earth}}}{r}
\]
where \(G = 6.67430 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{m}^3 \text{kg}^{-1} \text{s}^{-2}\), \(M_{\text{Earth}} = 5.972 \times 10^{24} \, \text{kg}\), and \(r = R_{\text{Earth}} + h = 6.371 \times 10^6 + 3.3 \times 10^5 = 6.701 \times 10^6 \, \text{m}\).

1. Compute the difference in gravitational potential:
   \[
   \Delta \Phi = \Phi_{\text{shuttle}} - \Phi_{\text{Earth}} = \frac{G M_{\text{Earth}}}{R_{\text{Earth}} (R_{\text{Earth}} + h)}
   \]
   Substituting values:
   \[
   \Delta \Phi \approx 3.085 \times 10^6 \, \text{m}^2/\text{s}^2
   \]

2. The GR time dilation rate is:
   \[
   \Delta t_{\text{GR}} = \frac{\Delta \Phi}{c^2} = \frac{3.085 \times 10^6}{9 \times 10^{16}} \approx 34.28 \, \text{ps/s}
   \]

### Total Time Dilation
The total time dilation is the sum of the SR and GR effects:
\[
\Delta t_{\text{total}} = \Delta t_{\text{SR}} - \Delta t_{\text{GR}} = 330.85 - 34.28 \approx 296.57 \, \text{ps/s}
\]

This value is very close to the measured result of \(-295.02 \, \text{ps/s}\), which includes the GR effect. Therefore, the expected time lost per second for the moving clock is approximately **295.02 ps/s**.

**Answer: G**
