Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the energy change, ΔE, for a reaction. The reaction given is H₂(g) + (1/2)O₂(g) → H₂O(l). The question provides the heat of combustion of H₂ gas at 1 atm and 25°C as -68.32 kcal/mol. I need to find the ΔE for this reaction, and then choose the correct option from A to J.

First, I should remember what heat of combustion means. Heat of combustion is the amount of heat released when a substance reacts completely with oxygen to produce specified products, usually CO₂ and H₂O. In this case, the problem is about hydrogen combustion, so the product is water in liquid form.

The reaction provided is the combustion of hydrogen gas to form liquid water. The given heat of combustion is -68.32 kcal/mol. Wait, but the units are in kcal, and the options are in kJ. I'll need to convert units at some point.

Wait, let me think: the heat of combustion is given per mole of H₂. The reaction as written is for one mole of H₂ reacting. So the ΔE for the reaction as written should be the same as the heat of combustion, right? Because combustion is exothermic, so the ΔE should be negative.

But wait, wait. The heat of combustion is usually expressed as the heat released when one mole of a substance is burned. So for H₂, the combustion reaction is 2 H₂ + O₂ → 2 H₂O(l), and the ΔE for that reaction would be 2 × (-68.32 kcal/mol) = -136.64 kcal. But wait, the given reaction is H₂ + (1/2) O₂ → H₂O(l), which is half of the standard combustion reaction. So for one mole of H₂, the ΔE would be -68.32 kcal.

But the options are in kJ, so I need to convert kcal to kJ. I remember that 1 kcal is approximately 4.184 kJ. So, 68.32 kcal × 4.184 kJ/kcal.

Let me calculate that: 68.32 × 4.184. Let's see, 68 × 4 is 272, and 0.32 ×4 is about 1.28, so around 273.28. But more accurately:

68.32 × 4.184 = ?

Let me do it step by step:

68 × 4.184 = (60×4.184)+(8×4.184)
60×4.184 = 251.04
8×4.184 = 33.472 → total 251.04 +33.472 = 284.512

Now 0.32 ×4.184 = 1.33888

So total is 284.512 +1.33888 = 285.85088 kJ.

Since the heat of combustion is negative, the ΔE would be -285.85 kJ. Looking at the options, option J is -285.9 kJ, which is very close. Alternatively, option E is -282.2 kJ, which is a bit off.

Wait, but why is the answer J and not E? Let me double-check the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me re-calculate 68.32 ×4.184.

68.32 ×4.184:

Let me break it down:

68.32 ×4 = 273.28

68.32 ×0.184 = ?

Calculate 68.32 ×0.1 = 6.832

68.32 ×0.08 = 5.4656

68.32 ×0.004 = 0.27328

Add them: 6.832 +5.4656 = 12.2976 +0.27328 = 12.57088

So total is 273.28 +12.57088 = 285.85088 kJ.

So the ΔE is -285.85 kJ, which rounds to -285.9 kJ. So the correct option is J.

Wait, but wait another thing: The reaction given is the combustion of H₂ to form H₂O(l). The heat of combustion is given as -68.32 kcal/mol, which is for the reaction as written. So the ΔE for that reaction is indeed -68.32 kcal/mol, which converts to about -285.9 kJ. So option J is correct.

The reaction provided is the combustion of hydrogen gas to form liquid water. The heat of combustion of H₂ is given as -68.32 kcal/mol, which is the energy released when one mole of H₂ reacts completely. Since the reaction as written involves one mole of H₂, the ΔE for this reaction is -68.32 kcal. Converting this to kilojoules using the factor 1 kcal ≈ 4.184 kJ gives:

\[
68.32 \, \text{kcal} \times 4.184 \, \text{kJ/kcal} = 285.85 \, \text{kJ}.
\]

Since the reaction is exothermic, the ΔE is negative, resulting in -285.9 kJ. This matches option J.

Answer: J
