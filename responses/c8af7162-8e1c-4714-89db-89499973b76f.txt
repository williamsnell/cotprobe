Question:

What is the rationale of subtracting expenditures for im-ports in measuring aggregate demand as compared to adding exports as a new component of aggregate demand?

Options:

A: Exports represent spending on foreign goods
B: Imports represent spending on foreign goods inducing production abroad, while exports increase domestic production and create jobs.
C: Exports represent a transfer of domestic wealth to foreign entities
D: Expenditures for imports and exports are both added in measuring aggregate demand
E: Exports are subtracted because they represent an outflow of domestic currency
F: Imports are not significant to the economy, whereas exports are the main driver of economic growth
G: Imports are investments in foreign markets, and exports are considered a form of savings
H: Imports and exports are considered equal and cancel each other out in aggregate demand
I: Imports increase domestic production
J: Imports represent domestic consumption, and exports are deducted to avoid double counting in GDP calculations

Okay, so I have this question about aggregate demand, and I need to figure out why we subtract imports but add exports. Hmm, let me think. I remember that aggregate demand is about the total spending in an economy. It's usually broken down into consumption (C), investment (I), government spending (G), and net exports (Xn). 

Net exports are exports minus imports, right? So when we measure aggregate demand, we add exports because they are goods produced domestically and sold abroad. That makes sense because it's adding value to the economyâ€”like when a U.S. company sells cars to another country, that's part of our GDP. But why subtract imports?

Imports are goods we buy from other countries. If we don't subtract them, we might be counting something that wasn't produced domestically. For example, if I buy a phone made in China, it's part of China's production, not ours. So if we include it in our aggregate demand, we'd be overcounting our own economic output because that phone wasn't made here. By subtracting imports, we're only counting what was produced domestically, which gives a more accurate picture of our economy's performance.

Wait, but why isn't it the other way around? Like, why don't we add imports? Oh, because when we add exports, we're including foreign demand for our goods. Imports, on the other hand, are foreign goods bought by us, so they don't contribute to our production. Subtracting them ensures we're not inflating our GDP by including things we didn't make.

Looking at the options, option B says imports represent spending on foreign goods, which induces production abroad, while exports increase domestic production and create jobs. That makes sense because when we export, we're producing more at home, which is good for our economy. Imports, though, support production elsewhere, not here. So subtracting imports avoids overcounting and ensures we're measuring our own economic activity accurately.

Another option that caught my eye is option J, which says imports represent domestic consumption and exports are deducted to avoid double counting. Wait, no, I think J is mixing things up. Imports are foreign goods consumed domestically, but why would we represent them as domestic consumption? That part doesn't sound right. Exports are subtracted because they're part of net exports, which are exports minus imports. So J's reasoning might be off.

Option C says exports are a transfer of wealth. That's more about the balance of payments, not the rationale for subtracting imports. So probably not C.

Option E talks about subtracting exports because they're an outflow of currency. But in aggregate demand, exports are added because they're part of our sales to others, not subtracted. So E is incorrect.

Option B still seems the most accurate. It correctly differentiates between the effects of imports and exports on the domestic economy. Imports lead to production abroad, so they're subtracted. Exports lead to more domestic production, hence added.

The rationale for subtracting imports when measuring aggregate demand is that imports represent spending on foreign goods, which induces production in other countries rather than contributing to domestic production. In contrast, exports are added because they increase domestic production and create jobs. This ensures that aggregate demand accurately reflects the domestic economy's output.

Answer: B
