Okay, let's tackle this probability problem step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll try to break it down carefully.

We have two Boolean random variables, A and B. That means each can be either true (1) or false (0). The given probabilities are:

- P(A) = 1/2: So the probability that A is true is 1/2.
- P(B) = 1/3: The probability that B is true is 1/3.
- P(A | ¬B) = 1/4: The probability that A is true given that B is not true is 1/4.

We need to find P(A | B), the probability that A is true given that B is true.

First, I remember that conditional probability is defined as P(A | B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B). Similarly, P(A | ¬B) = P(A ∩ ¬B) / P(¬B).

We can denote P(A ∩ B) as P(A and B both true), and P(A ∩ ¬B) as P(A true and B false).

We know P(A | ¬B) = 1/4. So, 1/4 = P(A ∩ ¬B) / P(¬B). Let's compute P(¬B) because P(B) is given as 1/3. So P(¬B) = 1 - P(B) = 1 - 1/3 = 2/3.

Plugging into the equation: 1/4 = P(A ∩ ¬B) / (2/3). Solving for P(A ∩ ¬B), we multiply both sides by 2/3: P(A ∩ ¬B) = (1/4) * (2/3) = 2/12 = 1/6.

Now, we know that the total probability of A being true, P(A), is the sum of the probabilities when B is true and when B is false. That is, P(A) = P(A ∩ B) + P(A ∩ ¬B). We already have P(A) = 1/2 and P(A ∩ ¬B) = 1/6.

So, 1/2 = P(A ∩ B) + 1/6. Let's solve for P(A ∩ B). Subtract 1/6 from both sides: P(A ∩ B) = 1/2 - 1/6. To subtract these, convert to common denominators: 1/2 is 3/6, so 3/6 - 1/6 = 2/6 = 1/3.

Now, we can find P(A | B) using the conditional probability formula: P(A | B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B). We have P(A ∩ B) = 1/3 and P(B) = 1/3.

So, P(A | B) = (1/3) / (1/3) = 1.

Wait, that seems high. Let me check again.

P(A) = P(A and B) + P(A and not B). We found P(A and not B) = 1/6, and P(A) is 1/2, so P(A and B) must be 1/2 - 1/6 = 1/3. Then, P(A | B) is (1/3) / (1/3) = 1. So yes, that's correct.

So the answer should be 1, which corresponds to option D.

The probability P(A | B) is calculated by finding the conditional probability using the given values. After determining the necessary probabilities, it turns out that P(A | B) equals 1.
