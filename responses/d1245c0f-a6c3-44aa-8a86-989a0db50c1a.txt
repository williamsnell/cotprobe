Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about interspecies interactions, and I need to figure out which option is not a form of that. Let me start by recalling what interspecies interaction means. It refers to the various ways different species interact with each other in an ecosystem. The main types I remember are things like mutualism, commensalism, parasitism, and maybe predation. Oh, and there's also competition, but I'm not sure if that's considered here.

Looking at the options, A is commensalism. I think that's when one species benefits and the other isn't affected, like how some birds perch on cattle to eat insects. So that's definitely a form of interspecies interaction.

Option B is succession. Hmm, I'm a bit confused about this one. Succession refers to the process by which ecosystems change and develop over time, like from a grassland to a forest. It's more about the change in species composition over time rather than direct interactions between species. So maybe succession isn't a form of interaction itself but a broader process.

Option C is mutualism. That's when both species benefit from the interaction, like how bees pollinate flowers and get nectar in return. Definitely an interspecies interaction.

Option D is parasitism. Parasites live in or on a host and harm it, while benefiting themselves. That's a classic example of interspecies interaction.

So, putting it all together, the question is asking which is NOT a form of interspecies interaction. Since commensalism, mutualism, and parasitism all involve direct interactions for mutual benefit or harm, they fit. Succession, on the other hand, isn't a direct interaction but a process that involves changes over time in the community of species. Therefore, the answer should be B: Succession.

The question asks which option is not a form of interspecies interaction. 

- **A: Commensalism** involves one species benefiting while the other is unaffected, which is an interspecies interaction. 
- **B: Succession** refers to the process of ecosystem change over time, not a direct interaction between species. 
- **C: Mutualism** involves mutual benefit between species, making it an interspecies interaction. 
- **D: Parasitism** involves one species harming another for its benefit, which is an interspecies interaction.

Since succession is a broader process rather than a direct interaction, the correct answer is **B**.

Answer: B
