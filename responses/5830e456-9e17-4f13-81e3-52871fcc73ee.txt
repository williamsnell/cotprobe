Alright, so I have this question about the largest Hindu temple complex ever constructed, and I need to figure out where it's located. The options are A through J, with places like Vietnam, Sri Lanka, Bali, Thailand, Bombay, Cambodia, Java, Delhi, Nepal, and Calcutta. Hmm, I'm not super familiar with all these places, but I'll try to piece it together.

First, I know that Hinduism is a major religion in India, Nepal, and some neighboring countries. So the temple is likely in one of these regions. Let me think about the major temple complexes I've heard of. There's the Taj Mahal, but that's a mausoleum, not a temple. Then there's Varanasi in India, which is an ancient city with many temples, but I'm not sure if it's the largest complex.

Wait, I think about Angkor Wat in Cambodia. That's a huge complex, but isn't that a Hindu temple? Or is it Buddhist? I'm a bit confused. I remember that Angkor Wat was originally a Hindu temple dedicated to the god Vishnu, built by King Suryavarman II in the early 12th century. But later, it became a Buddhist site. So if the question is about the largest Hindu temple complex ever, maybe Angkor Wat fits because it was originally Hindu.

Looking at the options, F is Cambodia. So that's a possibility. Another thought: India has many large temples, like the ones in Jaipur or maybe Ellora Caves. But are any of those the largest? I'm not sure. Also, the question says "ever constructed," so it might be referring to something ancient or of significant size.

Then there's Java, which is an island in Indonesia. I think there are some large Hindu-Buddhist temples there, like Borobudur, but that's more Buddhist. Wait, Java might have Prambanan, which is a Hindu temple complex. Is that the largest? I'm not certain about its size compared to Angkor Wat.

Bombay is in India, but I don't recall a massive temple there. Delhi has some important sites, like the Red Fort, but again, not sure about a temple. Calcutta is in India too, but I don't think it's known for the largest temple complex.

Wait, another thought: The largest temple complex in India might be the one in Sringeri or somewhere in Karnataka, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe the largest is in Bali, but Bali is predominantly Hindu, and I think their temples are significant, but I'm not sure if any of them are the largest in the world.

So, considering all this, Angkor Wat in Cambodia seems like a strong candidate because it's a massive complex and was originally a Hindu temple. It's also one of the largest religious complexes ever built. So the answer might be F: Cambodia.

The largest Hindu temple complex ever constructed is found in Cambodia, specifically Angkor Wat, which was originally a Hindu temple dedicated to the god Vishnu.
