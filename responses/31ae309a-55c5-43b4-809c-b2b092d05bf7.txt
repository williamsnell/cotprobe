Answer:
    
<think>
Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an interferometer and calculating the distance between two points. Hmm, let me think. I've studied a bit about interference and interferometers before, but I'm a bit rusty, so I'll have to go through this step by step.

The question says that an interferometer is illuminated with red light from cadmium, and the wavelength is given as 6438 A. Wait, A is angstroms, right? So that's 6438 angstroms. I remember that 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters, so the wavelength λ is 6438e-10 meters. Let me write that down: λ = 6438e-10 m = 6.438e-7 meters.

The problem states that 120 minima pass the reference mark as the mirror is moved from one point to the other. I need to find the distance D between these two points. The options are in centimeters, so I'll have to convert my final answer accordingly.

Wait, what's a minimum in an interferometer setup? Oh right, in an interferometer, the interference pattern arises from the path difference between the two beams. For a minimum (destructive interference), the path difference should be an odd multiple of half-wavelengths. The formula is something like path difference = (n + 1/2)λ, where n is an integer starting from 0. But when multiple fringes pass a point, each fringe corresponds to a change in the path difference by λ. So each fringe (minimum or maximum) is spaced by λ.

Wait, but wait. In an interferometer, the number of fringes observed is related to the change in the path difference. When the mirror is moved by a distance D, the path difference changes by 2D because each beam reflects once, so the total path difference is 2D. Oh right, because one beam goes straight through, and the other reflects, so the change in path is 2D when the mirror is moved by D.

So the formula I think I need is: the number of fringes (N) is equal to the change in the path difference divided by the wavelength. But wait, for minima, each fringe corresponds to a path difference change of λ, but since the path difference is 2D, then the number of minima N is (2D) / λ. Because each minimum occurs every λ/2 in path difference, but wait, no, wait. Let me clarify.

In an interferometer setup, the condition for a minimum (destructive interference) is when the path difference is (m + 1/2)λ, where m is 0,1,2,... Each time the mirror moves by a distance that changes the path difference by λ, another minimum is observed. So the total number of minima N is equal to the total change in the path difference divided by λ.

Wait, but the path difference change is 2D because D is the distance the mirror moves, and each reflection adds D to the path. So total path difference is 2D. So the number of minima N is (2D) / λ. But wait, no, because each fringe corresponds to a change of λ in path difference. So N = (2D) / λ.

Wait, but in the problem, N is 120. So 120 = (2D) / λ. Solving for D, we get D = (N * λ) / 2. Let me plug in the numbers.

N is 120, λ is 6438e-10 m. Wait, let me compute it step by step. So 2D = N * λ. So D = (N * λ) / 2.

So D = (120 * 6438e-10 m) / 2. Let's compute that.

First, compute 120 * 6438e-10. 120 * 6438 = let's see. 120 * 6000 is 720,000. 120 * 438 is 120*400=48,000; 120*38=4,560. So 48,000 +4,560 =52,560. So total 720,000 +52,560 =772,560. So 772,560e-10 m.

Wait, but that's 772,560e-10 m. Divided by 2, so D = 772,560e-10 /2 = 386,280e-10 m.

Wait, 386,280e-10 meters is equal to 3.8628e-5 meters. To convert to centimeters, since 1 m = 100 cm, so 3.8628e-5 m = 0.0038628 cm. Wait, but looking at the options, none of them are around 0.0038 cm. The options start from 0.00456 cm (J) up to 0.01158 cm (H). So I must have messed up somewhere.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the formula. Let me think again. The number of fringes (minima) observed is equal to the total change in the path difference divided by the wavelength. So N = (2D) / λ → D = (N * λ) / 2.

Wait, let me check the calculation again. 120 * 6438e-10 m is (120 * 6438) * 1e-10 m. 120 *6438: Let me compute 6438 *120.

6438 * 100 = 643,800.

6438 * 20 = 128,760.

Total is 643,800 + 128,760 = 772,560. So 772,560e-10 m. Divided by 2: 386,280e-10 m = 3.8628e-5 m = 0.0038628 cm.

But the options don't have this. Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake in the setup. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe the formula is different. I've heard that in some setups, the number of fringes is 2D/λ, but perhaps I'm missing a factor. Let me think about how the fringes are counted.

In an interferometer, each fringe corresponds to a change in the path difference by λ. So if the path difference changes by 2D, then the number of fringes N is 2D / λ. So yes, N=2D/λ → D = Nλ/2.

But according to that, my calculation gives 0.00386 cm, which isn't among the options. The options given are all higher, like 0.00456 cm (J), 0.00589 (A), etc. So where did I go wrong?

Wait, perhaps the wavelength is in a different unit? Let me double-check the problem statement. It says λ = 6438 A. Oh wait, A is angstroms, which is 1e-10 meters. So 6438 A is 6438e-10 m, which is correct.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the number. Let me compute N * λ again. 120 * 6438e-10 m.

Wait, 120 * 6438 = 120 * 6000 = 720,000; 120 * 438 = 52,560. So total 772,560. So 772,560e-10 m. Divided by 2, that's 386,280e-10 m, which is 3.8628e-5 m = 0.0038628 cm. Hmm. But the options don't have this. Maybe I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula should be D = (N+0.5)*λ/2? No, I don't think so. Because each minimum is spaced by λ in the path difference. So for N minima, the path difference changes by N*λ. So 2D = N*λ → D = Nλ/2.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I'm using meters instead of centimeters somewhere. Let me try converting the wavelength to centimeters first.

λ = 6438e-10 m = 6438e-8 cm, because 1 m = 100 cm, so 1e-10 m = 1e-8 cm. So 6438e-8 cm.

So D = (120 * 6438e-8 cm) / 2.

Compute 120 * 6438e-8 cm. 120 *6438 =772,560. So 772,560e-8 cm. Divided by 2: 386,280e-8 cm. 386,280e-8 is 3.8628e-3 cm, which is 0.0038628 cm. Same result.

But the options don't have this. Hmm. Maybe I'm missing a factor. Let me think again. Oh, wait! Maybe the formula is D = (N + 0.5) * λ / 2. Because the first minimum occurs at (λ/2) change. So for N minima, the total path difference is (N+0.5)*λ. But wait, no, in the setup, the total path difference would be (N+0.5)*λ? Or is it N * λ?

Wait, perhaps the formula is N = (2D)/λ. So D = Nλ/2. Let me compute using this. With N=120, λ=6438e-10 m.

D = (120 * 6438e-10 m) / 2. Let me compute 120 *6438 =772,560. So 772,560e-10 m = 7.7256e-5 m. Divide by 2: 3.8628e-5 m = 0.0038628 cm.

Still the same result. So perhaps the answer isn't among the options. But that can't be right because the problem must have an answer. So maybe I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, the problem says "120 minima pass the reference mark as the mirror is moved from one of the points to the other." So the mirror is moved from point A to point B, and during this movement, 120 minima are observed. So the total change in the path difference is 120 * λ, because each minimum corresponds to a path difference change of λ.

So 2D = 120 * λ → D = 60 * λ.

Wait, no, 2D = 120 * λ → D = 60 * λ. Let me compute that.

λ =6438e-10 m. So 60 *6438e-10 m = 386,280e-10 m = 3.8628e-5 m = 0.0038628 cm. Again the same result.

Hmm. None of the options match this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Maybe the correct formula is D = (N + 1/2) * λ /2.

Wait, for the first minimum, the path difference is λ/2. So when the mirror moves by D, the path difference change is 2D. So the number of minima is the number of times the path difference increases by λ/2. Wait, no, each minimum is spaced by λ in the path difference. Because the condition for minima is (m + 1/2)λ, so each minima is λ apart in the path difference.

Wait, perhaps I should think differently. The total number of minima is the number of times the path difference increases by λ. So 2D = N * λ → D = Nλ/2.

But according to that, D is 0.00386 cm, which isn't in the options. So maybe I need to check the options again.

Wait, looking at the options:

A: 0.00589 cm → 5.89e-3 cm

B: 0.00832 cm → 8.32e-3 cm

C: 0.00647 cm → 6.47e-3 cm

D: 0.00773 cm →7.73e-3 cm

E: 0.00876 cm →8.76e-3 cm

F: 0.00700 cm →7.00e-3 cm

G: 0.00912 cm →9.12e-3 cm

H: 0.01158 cm →1.158e-2 cm

I: 0.01024 cm →1.024e-2 cm

J: 0.00456 cm →4.56e-3 cm

Wait, my calculation was 0.00386 cm, which is about 0.00386 cm, which is between J (0.00456) and none of the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait another thought: maybe the formula uses the number of fringes, which is one less than the number of minima? Wait, no, each fringe corresponds to a minima or maxima. Wait, no, the problem specifies minima, so each minima is a fringe. So N=120 minima → N=120 fringes.

Wait, perhaps the formula is that the number of fringes is 2D/λ. So N = 2D/λ → D = Nλ/2.

But with N=120, λ=6438e-10 m → D= (120 *6438e-10)/2 = 386,280e-10 m = 3.8628e-5 m = 0.0038628 cm.

Hmm, same result. So perhaps the correct answer isn't listed, but that can't be. Maybe I made a mistake in units somewhere.

Wait, let me try converting λ to centimeters first. 6438 A = 6438e-10 m = 6438e-8 cm. Because 1 m = 100 cm, so 1e-10 m = 1e-8 cm.

So λ = 6438e-8 cm.

Then D = (120 * 6438e-8 cm) / 2.

Compute 120 *6438e-8: 120 *6438 =772,560 →772,560e-8 cm.

Divide by 2: 386,280e-8 cm = 3.8628e-3 cm = 0.0038628 cm.

Same result. So I'm confident my calculation is correct, but the options don't have it. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses a different formula, like D = (N * λ)/4. Let me try that.

If D = (120 *6438e-10 m)/4 → (772,560e-10)/4 = 193,140e-10 m = 1.9314e-5 m = 0.0019314 cm. That's even smaller, which doesn't match any option either.

Wait, maybe it's D = (N+1)*λ/2? Let's try N=120.

(120+1)*6438e-10 /2 = 121*6438e-10 /2.

121*6438 = let's see: 120*6438=772,560, plus 6438 → 772,560 +6,438=779,  so 779, (wait, 772560 +6438=779,  I think 772,560 +6,438 = 779, (wait, 772,560 +6,438 = 779, (wait 772,560 +6,438 = 779, (wait 772,560 +6,438 = 779, (wait, 772,560 +6,438 = 779, (wait, perhaps I should compute it accurately.

121 *6438 = (120 *6438) + (1 *6438) =772,560 +6,438=779,  (772,560 +6,438 = 779, because 772,560 +6,000 = 778,560, plus 438 →778,560 +438=778,998. So 778,998e-10 m.

Divide by 2: 389,499e-10 m =3.89499e-5 m =0.00389499 cm. Still not matching any option.

Hmm. Maybe I should try another approach. Let's think about the formula again.

In an interferometer, the condition for constructive interference is when the path difference is an integer multiple of λ, and destructive (minima) is when it's an odd multiple of λ/2. So the path difference Δ = (m + 1/2)λ, where m is 0,1,2,...

When the mirror moves by a distance D, the path difference changes by 2D. So the number of minima observed would be the number of times 2D passes through these points. So the number of minima N is the integer part of (2D)/(λ/2) ), because each minima is spaced by λ/2 in the path difference. Wait, no, wait: the change in path difference between each minima is λ. Because from m=0 to m=1, the path difference increases by λ. So the number of minima is the number of λ intervals in 2D.

So N = (2D)/λ → D = Nλ/2.

Again, same formula. So D=120 *6438e-10 /2 =0.0038628 cm.

Since none of the options match, perhaps the problem uses a different approach. Maybe it's using the number of fringes as 2N or something else.

Wait, perhaps the formula is D = (N * λ)/4. Let me try that. 120 *6438e-10 /4 = 193,140e-10 m =1.9314e-5 m =0.0019314 cm. No, that's even smaller.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is D = (N + 1) * λ /2. So for 120 minima, N=120. D=(120+1)*6438e-10 /2 = (121 *6438e-10)/2.

As before, that gives about 0.003895 cm, which is still not matching any option.

Wait, maybe the problem is using the number of fringes as the number of maxima, which would be N = (2D)/λ. But that doesn't change the result.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the number of fringes as (2D + λ/2)/λ → N= (2D + λ/2)/λ → 2D = (N λ) - λ/2 → D = (N λ - λ/2)/2.

But that seems more complicated and probably wouldn't give an exact match to the options.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the units of λ. Let me double-check. The wavelength is given as 6438 A, which is 6438 angstroms. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters, so 6438e-10 m is correct. Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses nanometers? No, 6438 A is 643.8 nm, which is correct for red light from cadmium.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is considering the first minima as m=0, and the last as m=119, making 120 minima. So the total change in path difference would be from m=0 to m=119, which is 119 intervals of λ. So 2D = 119 * λ → D= (119 * λ)/2.

Let me try that. N=120 minima would correspond to 119 intervals of λ in the path difference. So 2D=119λ → D=119λ/2.

So λ=6438e-10 m.

Compute 119 *6438e-10 = 119 *6438 = let's compute:

6438 *100=643,800

6438 *19= let's compute:

6438 *10=64,380

6438 *9=57,942 → total 64,380 +57,942=122,322.

So 643,800 +122,322=766,122.

So 766,122e-10 m.

Divide by 2: 383,061e-10 m =3.83061e-5 m=0.00383061 cm. Still not matching any option.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Maybe I should look at the options again and see which one is closest to my calculation, but none are close. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula, and the correct formula is D = (N * λ)/4.

Let me try that. D=120 *6438e-10 /4 = (772,560e-10)/4=193,140e-10 m=1.9314e-5 m=0.0019314 cm. No, that's even smaller.

Wait, perhaps the formula is D = (N * λ)/2, but I forgot to convert to centimeters correctly. Wait, 1 meter is 100 cm, so 1e-5 meters is 0.001 cm. Wait, 3.8628e-5 m = 3.8628e-3 cm, which is 0.0038628 cm.

Looking at the options, the closest is J: 0.00456 cm, but it's still not matching. Alternatively, perhaps I should check if the wavelength was in nanometers instead of angstroms. Wait, 6438 A is 643.8 nm, which is correct for red light. So no mistake there.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of 120 *6438. Let me compute that again.

120 *6438:

Break it down: 100 *6438 =643,800.

20 *6438=128,760.

Total: 643,800 +128,760 =772,560. Correct.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Maybe the correct answer isn't listed, but that can't be. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the number of minima is 120, which includes both ends, so the path difference change is (120 -1)*λ.

Wait, that would make 2D = (120-1)*λ → D= (119 *6438e-10)/2.

Which would be 766,122e-10 /2=383,061e-10 m=3.83061e-5 m=0.00383061 cm.

Still not matching any option.

Wait, perhaps the formula is D = (N * λ)/4. Wait, let me try with N=120.

D= (120 *6438e-10)/4 = 120*6438=772,560 →772,560e-10 /4=193,140e-10 m=1.9314e-5 m=0.0019314 cm. No.

Alternatively, maybe the formula is D = (N * λ)/8? No, that would give even smaller.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the number of fringes as 120, but each fringe is λ/2. So the path difference is 120*(λ/2)=60λ. So 2D=60λ → D=30λ.

Wait, but that would be D=30 *6438e-10 m=193,140e-10 m=1.9314e-5 m=0.0019314 cm. Still not matching.

I'm really stuck here. Maybe I should look for another approach. Let's think about the formula again.

In an interferometer, the distance between two consecutive dark fringes (minima) is λ/2 in terms of the path difference. So the number of minima observed is the total change in the path difference divided by λ/2. So N = (2D) / (λ/2) )= 4D/λ → D= Nλ/4.

Wait, that's different. So if N=120, then D=120 *6438e-10 /4 = (772,560e-10)/4=193,140e-10 m=1.9314e-5 m=0.0019314 cm.

But that's even smaller and still not matching any option.

Wait, perhaps I got the formula wrong. Let me think again.

The condition for dark fringes (minima) is when the path difference is (m + 1/2)λ, where m=0,1,2,... So the path difference changes by λ between each minima. So the number of minima observed is the number of λ intervals in the total path difference.

So N = (2D) / λ → D= Nλ/2.

Which brings me back to the original calculation of 0.0038628 cm.

Looking back at the options, perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup. Let me read the problem again.

Wait, the question says "the mirror is moved from one of the points to the other." So the mirror moves a distance D, causing the path difference to change by 2D. So the formula should be correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the number of fringes as 120, but each fringe is a maxima, not a minima. So the formula would be N = 2D/λ → D= Nλ/2.

Same result as before.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the wavelength given is in a different unit, like nanometers. Let me check: 6438 A is 643.8 nm. So λ=643.8e-9 m.

Wait, but no, the calculation was correct in angstroms.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the distance in meters and then convert to centimeters correctly.

Wait, 3.8628e-5 meters is 0.0038628 centimeters. To three decimal places, that's 0.00386 cm.

Looking at the options, the closest is J: 0.00456 cm, which is about 0.00456 cm. But that's larger than my calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial formula. Maybe the formula is D = (N * λ)/2, but I should include a factor due to the type of interference. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different definition, like counting the number of fringes between the two points, which might include an extra fringe.

Wait, perhaps the formula is D = (N + 0.5) * λ/2. Let's try that.

N=120 → (120 +0.5)*6438e-10 /2.

So 120.5 *6438e-10 = let's compute 120 *6438=772,560; 0.5*6438=3,219. So total 772,560 +3,219=775,779.

So 775,779e-10 m → divided by 2: 387,889.5e-10 m =3.878895e-5 m=0.003878895 cm. Still not matching any option.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using D = (N * λ)/2 but in centimeters. Let me compute it again in cm.

λ=6438e-10 m=6438e-8 cm. So D=(120 *6438e-8 cm)/2= (772,560e-8 cm)/2=386,280e-8 cm=3.8628e-3 cm=0.0038628 cm.

Same result.

Wait, perhaps the problem has a typo, and the correct answer is not listed. Alternatively, perhaps I should look at the options and see which one is closest to 0.00386 cm. The options start at J:0.00456 cm, which is about 0.00456 cm. That's about 20% higher than my calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup. Maybe the mirror moves a distance D, but the path difference change is D, not 2D. Let me try that.

If the path difference change is D, then N= D/λ → D=Nλ.

So D=120 *6438e-10 m=772,560e-10 m=7.7256e-5 m=0.0077256 cm. Wait, that's 0.0077256 cm, which is approximately 0.00773 cm. Looking at the options, D is option D: 0.00773 cm.

Ah! So perhaps I made a mistake in considering the path difference. Maybe the path difference is just D, not 2D. Wait, that would make sense in a different setup. Let me think about the interferometer setup.

In a standard Michelson interferometer, one beam reflects off a moving mirror, and the other goes through a fixed path. So when the mirror moves by D, the path difference changes by 2D because the reflecting beam's path increases by D, while the other beam's path doesn't change. So the total path difference change is 2D.

But perhaps in this problem, the setup is different. Maybe it's a different type of interferometer where the path difference change is D. For example, if only one beam reflects, then moving the mirror by D would change the path difference by D. But that's less common.

If that's the case, then D = N * λ.

So N=120, λ=6438e-10 m.

D=120 *6438e-10 m=772,560e-10 m=7.7256e-5 m=0.0077256 cm, which is approximately 0.00773 cm, matching option D.

So perhaps the correct formula is D = N * λ, leading to D=0.00773 cm, which is option D.

The problem involves calculating the distance \( D \) between two points using an interferometer illuminated with red light (\( \lambda = 6438 \, \text{A} = 6438 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \)) as 120 minima pass the reference mark. The key formula relates the number of minima \( N \) to the distance \( D \) through the path difference in the interferometer.

In an interferometer, the condition for minima (destructive interference) is when the path difference is an odd multiple of \( \lambda/2 \). When the mirror moves by a distance \( D \), the path difference changes by \( 2D \). The number of minima \( N \) is given by:

\[
N = \frac{2D}{\lambda}
\]

Rearranging for \( D \):

\[
D = \frac{N \lambda}{2}
\]

Substituting \( N = 120 \) and \( \lambda = 6438 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \):

\[
D = \frac{120 \times 6438 \times 10^{-10}}{2} = 386,280 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} = 3.8628 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{m} = 0.0038628 \, \text{cm}
\]

This result does not match any of the provided options. However, reevaluating the setup, if the path difference changes by \( D \) instead of \( 2D \) (as might occur in a different interferometer configuration), the formula becomes:

\[
D = N \lambda
\]

Substituting \( N = 120 \) and \( \lambda = 6438 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \):

\[
D = 120 \times 6438 \times 10^{-10} = 772,560 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} = 7.7256 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{m} = 0.0077256 \, \text{cm}
\]

This result closely matches option **D: 0.00773 cm**. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**D**
