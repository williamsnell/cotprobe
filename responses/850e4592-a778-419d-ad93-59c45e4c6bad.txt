Okay, so I've got this probability problem here. Let me try to break it down step by step. The question is about a segment of length 10, and points A and B are chosen randomly. These points divide the segment into three smaller segments. I need to find the probability that these three smaller segments can form the sides of a triangle.

Hmm, I remember that for three lengths to form a triangle, they must satisfy the triangle inequality. That is, the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side. So, for the three segments x, y, z, each of them must be less than the sum of the other two.

Wait, but since the original segment is length 10, and points A and B are chosen randomly, I guess the lengths x, y, z must add up to 10. So, x + y + z = 10. But the triangle inequalities would require that each of x, y, z is less than 5 because if, say, x is 6, then y + z would only be 4, which is less than 6, so that wouldn't work.

Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again. The triangle inequality says that each side must be less than the sum of the other two. So, for each of x, y, z, that means x < y + z, y < x + z, and z < x + y. But since x + y + z = 10, we can substitute. For example, x < y + z is equivalent to x < 10 - x, which simplifies to x < 5. Similarly, y < 5 and z < 5. So, all three segments must be less than 5 in length for them to form a triangle.

So, the problem reduces to finding the probability that all three segments are less than 5 units long.

Now, how are points A and B chosen? Since the segment is length 10, I can imagine choosing two points along a line from 0 to 10. Let's call the positions of A and B as a and b, where 0 < a < b < 10. Wait, but actually, A and B could be in any order, so maybe I should define them as two distinct points along the segment, which can be anywhere between 0 and 10, but without loss of generality, I can assume A is to the left of B, so a < b. Alternatively, maybe it's easier to model this as selecting two points independently, and then considering their positions.

Wait, but when choosing two points randomly on the segment, the positions are uniformly distributed. So, the problem can be visualized as picking two numbers a and b between 0 and 10, and then sorting them so that a ≤ b. Then, the three segments would be from 0 to a, a to b, and b to 10, so their lengths would be a, b - a, and 10 - b.

So, the three lengths are x = a, y = b - a, z = 10 - b. All three must be less than 5.

So, the conditions are:
1. a < 5
2. b - a < 5
3. 10 - b < 5 → which simplifies to b > 5.

So, the three conditions are a < 5, b - a < 5, and b > 5.

Now, since a and b are between 0 and 10, with a ≤ b, we can model this as a square in the a-b plane, where a ranges from 0 to 10 on the x-axis and b from 0 to 10 on the y-axis, but only considering the region where a ≤ b, which is the area above the diagonal line a = b.

The total area of this region is (10 * 10) / 2 = 50.

Now, the favorable area is where all three conditions are met: a < 5, b > 5, and b - a < 5.

Let me try to visualize this region.

First, a must be less than 5, so we're looking at the area where a is between 0 and 5.

Second, b must be greater than 5, so b is between 5 and 10.

Third, b - a must be less than 5, which is equivalent to a > b - 5.

So, combining these, for each a between 0 and 5, b must be greater than 5 and less than a + 5. But since a is less than 5, a + 5 is less than 10, so b must be between 5 and a + 5.

Wait, but also, since a ≤ b, b can't be less than a. So, the lower bound for b is max(a, 5), and the upper bound is a + 5.

Wait, let me make sure. For a given a < 5, b must satisfy:

5 < b < a + 5,

and also b ≥ a.

So, the lower bound for b is max(a, 5). Since a < 5, max(a,5) is 5. So, for a between 0 and 5, b must be between 5 and a + 5.

But wait, a + 5 can't exceed 10, since a <5, so a +5 <10. So, the upper limit for b is a +5.

So, for each a between 0 and 5, the possible range for b is from 5 to a +5, but also, b must be ≤ 10, which it already is because a +5 ≤10.

So, the area where all three conditions are met is the integral over a from 0 to 5 of (a+5 -5) da, which is the integral of a da from 0 to5.

Wait, because for each a, the length of b is (a+5 -5) = a.

So, the area is the integral from a=0 to a=5 of a da. The integral of a is (a²)/2, evaluated from 0 to5, which is (25/2) - 0 = 12.5.

Wait, but wait, the total area where a <5, b>5, and b -a <5 is 12.5.

But the total possible area where a ≤b is 50, as calculated earlier.

So, the probability would be 12.5 /50 = 0.25, which is 25%.

But wait, I think I might have made a mistake here. Let me double-check.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps I should model this with a unit square, scaling down the problem to a segment of length 1 instead of 10, since the actual length might not matter, as we're dealing with proportions.

So, let's say the segment is of length 1. Then, the problem becomes choosing two points a and b in [0,1], with a < b, and the three segments would be a, b -a, and 1 -b. The conditions for forming a triangle would be each of these being less than 0.5.

So, the conditions are a < 0.5, b -a <0.5, and 1 -b <0.5 → b >0.5.

So, in the unit square where a < b, the area where a <0.5, b>0.5, and b -a <0.5.

Hmm, let's plot this. The unit square is from a=0 to1 and b=0 to1, but only considering a <b, so the area is 0.5.

The favorable region is a <0.5, b >0.5, and b -a <0.5.

So, for a between 0 and 0.5, and b between a and min(a+0.5,1).

Wait, but since a is up to 0.5, a+0.5 would be up to 1, so b can go up to a+0.5, which is between 0.5 and1.

So, for each a from 0 to0.5, the range of b is from max(a,0.5) to a+0.5.

But since a is up to 0.5, for a <0.5, max(a,0.5) is 0.5.

So, the range of b is from 0.5 to a+0.5.

Wait, but when a is 0, b ranges from 0.5 to0.5, which is just a point? That doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps I should think of this as a region where a <0.5, b>0.5, and b < a+0.5.

So, in the a-b plane, the lines are a=0.5, b=0.5, and b =a +0.5.

The region of interest is where a <0.5, b>0.5, and b < a+0.5.

Let me sketch this.

The line b = a +0.5 starts at (a=0, b=0.5) and goes up to (a=0.5, b=1). So, the region is a trapezoid bounded by a=0 to a=0.5, b=0.5 to b=a+0.5.

The area of this region can be found by integrating over a from 0 to0.5, the length of b which is (a+0.5 -0.5) = a.

So, the area is the integral from a=0 to a=0.5 of a da, which is (a²/2) from 0 to0.5 → (0.25/2) = 0.125.

Since the total area where a <b is 0.5, the probability is 0.125 /0.5 = 0.25, which is 25%.

Wait, but that's the same as before. So, in the unit case, the probability is 25%, which would mean in the original problem, it's also 25%.

But wait, I'm a bit confused because I remember another problem where the probability was 25%, but I'm not sure if that's the same scenario.

Wait, let me think again. The condition is that all three sides must be less than 5, which is half of 10. So, the probability is 25%.

Looking back at the options, option A is 25%, which would be the answer.

Wait, but I'm a bit uncertain because sometimes when points are selected randomly, the probability can be different. Let me think if there's another way to approach this.

Alternatively, perhaps using geometric probability, the region where all three conditions are met is a triangle within the square. The total area where a <5, b>5, and b -a <5 would form a triangle with vertices at (a=0, b=5), (a=0, b=5), and (a=5, b=10). Wait, no, because a can't exceed 5, and b can go up to 10.

Wait, no, when a is 5, b must be greater than5 and less than 5+5=10. So, the maximum b is 10, but a can't be more than5.

Wait, perhaps I should model this in the a-b plane again. The conditions are a <5, b>5, and b <a+5.

So, for a <5, b must be between 5 and a+5, but also b must be greater than a.

So, the lower bound for b is max(a,5), and the upper bound is a+5.

So, for a between 0 and5:

- When a <5, max(a,5)=5.

So, for each a from 0 to5, b ranges from5 to a+5.

But when a is 0, b can be from5 to5, which is just a point. That doesn't contribute any area. Wait, that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that when a is less than5, and b is between5 and a+5, but a can't be more than5.

Wait, perhaps the area is a triangle with base from a=0 to a=5, and for each a, the width in b is (a+5 -5)=a.

So, the area is the integral from a=0 to5 of a da, which is (5^2)/2 =12.5.

The total area where a <b is 50, so the probability is12.5/50=0.25, which is 25%.

So, the answer should be 25%, which is option A.

To determine the probability that three segments formed by randomly choosing two points on a segment of length 10 can form a triangle, we apply the triangle inequality. For three lengths \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) to form a triangle, each must be less than the sum of the other two. Since the total length is 10, this implies each segment must be less than 5.

We model the problem by selecting two points \(a\) and \(b\) on the segment, where \(0 < a < b < 10\). The three segments are \(x = a\), \(y = b - a\), and \(z = 10 - b\). The conditions for forming a triangle are:
1. \(a < 5\),
2. \(b - a < 5\),
3. \(10 - b < 5 \implies b > 5\).

In the \(a\)-\(b\) plane, the total possible area where \(a < b\) is a triangle with area \(50\). The favorable area where all three conditions are satisfied is the region where \(a < 5\), \(b > 5\), and \(b - a < 5\). This region forms a smaller triangle with area \(12.5\). The probability is the ratio of the favorable area to the total area, which is \(12.5 / 50 = 0.25\) or \(25\%\).

Thus, the probability that the three segments can form a triangle is **25%**.
