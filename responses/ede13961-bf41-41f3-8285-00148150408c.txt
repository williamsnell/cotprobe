Question:

This question refers to the following information.
"Wherever I go—the street, the shop, the house, or the steamboat—I hear the people talk in such a way as to indicate that they are yet unable to conceive of the Negro as possessing any rights at all. Men who are honorable in their dealings with their white neighbors will cheat a Negro without feeling a single twinge of their honor. To kill a Negro they do not deem murder; to debauch a Negro woman they do not think fornication; to take the property away from a Negro they do not consider robbery. The people boast that when they get freedmen affairs in their own hands, to use their own classic expression, 'the niggers will catch hell.'
"The reason of all this is simple and manifest. The whites esteem the blacks their property by natural right, and however much they may admit that the individual relations of masters and slaves have been destroyed by the war and the President's emancipation proclamation, they still have an ingrained feeling that the blacks at large belong to the whites at large, and whenever opportunity serves they treat the colored people just as their profit, caprice or passion may dictate."
—Congressional testimony of Col. Samuel Thomas, Assistant Commissioner, Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen and Abandoned Lands, 1865

Alright, so I need to figure out which factor Alexander Hamilton thought was a source of the problems described in the given excerpt from Federalist #15. The excerpt talks about how whites in the post-war era still viewed blacks as property and treated them with impunity, which led to systemic issues like racism and lack of rights for African Americans.

First, I should recall what Federalist #15 is about. I remember that the Federalist Papers were written to support the ratification of the U.S. Constitution. Federalist #15, in particular, was written by Alexander Hamilton to address the weaknesses of the Articles of Confederation. He argued that a strong central government was necessary to maintain national unity and address various issues facing the country.

Looking at the options provided, the question is asking about the factor Hamilton believed was a problem. The excerpt in the question discusses racial discrimination and the belief that blacks were not entitled to rights, which ties into the persistence of slavery and racism. However, Hamilton's main focus in Federalist #15 was on the structural weaknesses of the government under the Articles of Confederation.

Hamilton's argument was that the central government was too weak, which led to problems like economic instability, lack of effective governance, and inability to enforce laws uniformly across the states. He emphasized the need for a stronger federal government to address these issues.

Looking at the options, option G mentions "The persistence of slavery and racial discrimination." While the excerpt discusses this issue, I'm not sure if Hamilton in Federalist #15 specifically pointed to slavery as the problem. His primary concern was about the structure of the government.

Option H is "a weak central government without the powers to address pressing issues." That sounds more aligned with Hamilton's argument in Federalist #15. He was critical of the Articles of Confederation because the central government lacked the necessary powers, leading to problems like state-level issues not being resolved effectively.

So, considering that, the correct answer would likely be H, as Hamilton focused on the need for a stronger central government to prevent the kind of problems described, even though the excerpt itself deals with racial issues. Hamilton's analysis in Federalist #15 was more about the governmental structure rather than specific social issues like slavery, although he did support a strong federal role in addressing various national problems.

The correct answer is H: a weak central government without the powers to address pressing issues.

Hamilton in Federalist #15 focused on the structural weaknesses of the government under the Articles of Confederation, emphasizing the need for a stronger central authority to effectively govern and resolve national issues. While the excerpt discusses racial discrimination, Hamilton's primary concern was the lack of adequate governmental power, aligning with option H.

Answer: H
