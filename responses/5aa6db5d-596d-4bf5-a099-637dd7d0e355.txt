Question:

Describe the function of the lateral-line system in fishes.

Options:

A: The lateral-line system in fishes helps with the digestion of food.
B: The lateral-line system in fishes is used for excreting waste materials.
C: The lateral-line system in fishes is involved in the secretion of hormones.
D: The lateral-line system in fishes is used for breathing.
E: The lateral-line system in fishes is used for vision.
F: The lateral-line system in fishes functions to absorb oxygen directly from the water.
G: The lateral-line system in fishes functions in the detection of sound and acceleration, enables the fish to detect localized as well as distant water disturbances, and functions as an organ of equilibrium.
H: The lateral-line system in fishes is primarily for attracting mates during the breeding season.
I: The lateral-line system in fishes is used for reproduction.
J: The lateral-line system in fishes is used for thermoregulation.

Okay, so I have this question about the function of the lateral-line system in fishes. I'm a bit rusty on my fish anatomy, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that fish have various sensory systems. They don't have external ears like humans, so they must have other ways to sense their environment. The lateral line system sounds familiar. I think it's related to sensing movements in the water.

Let me go through the options one by one. Option A says it's for digestion. That doesn't make sense because digestion is handled by the digestive system, not a sensory organ. Option B is about excreting waste, which is the job of kidneys and other organs, so no. Option C talks about hormones; the lateral line probably isn't involved in that. Option D is breathing, which is done through gills, so D is off.

Option E mentions vision. Fish do have eyes, but I don't think the lateral line is for vision. It's more about detecting things in the water, like movement or pressure changes. Option F says it's for absorbing oxygen. That's not right because oxygen absorption is through gills. Option G is about detecting sound and acceleration, and helping with equilibrium. That rings a bellâ€”I remember that the lateral line helps fish detect vibrations and water movements, which is crucial for avoiding predators or catching prey. It might also help with balance.

Option H says it's for attracting mates. While some fish use coloration or sounds for mating, that's more about courtship behaviors, not the lateral line's primary function. Option I is about reproduction, which is a broader process and not directly related to the lateral line. Option J talks about thermoregulation, which is about temperature control, something fish might not need as much since they're in water and their body temps often adjust to the environment.

So, putting it all together, the lateral-line system is mainly for detecting changes in the water, like sounds or movements, which helps with balance and detecting predators or prey. That fits with option G.

The lateral-line system in fishes functions to detect sound and acceleration, enabling the fish to detect localized as well as distant water disturbances, and functions as an organ of equilibrium.
