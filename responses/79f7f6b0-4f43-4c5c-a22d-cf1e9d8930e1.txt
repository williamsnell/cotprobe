Okay, so I've got this question here: "What kind of angle is formed where two perpendicular lines meet?" And there are several options to choose from. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step.

First, I remember that when two lines are perpendicular, they intersect at a specific type of angle. I think it's related to 90 degrees because I've heard the term "right angle" before. Let me think about what each term means.

Reflex angles are those that are greater than 180 degrees but less than 360. So, that's probably not it because perpendicular lines don't form such large angles. Complementary angles add up to 90 degrees, so that's not the case here since we're looking for a single angle, not two that add up to something.

Supplementary angles add up to 180 degrees. Again, that's about two angles, not one. Zero angle would be if the lines are overlapping, but perpendicular lines cross each other, so that's not right either.

A right angle is exactly 90 degrees, which makes sense because when two lines are perpendicular, they form four right angles where they meet. So that must be the answer. Let me double-check the other options to make sure I'm not missing something.

Invisible angle? That doesn't make sense. Full rotation is 360 degrees, which is a full circle, not what happens here. Acute angles are less than 90 degrees, and obtuse are more than 90 but less than 180. Neither of those apply because the angle is exactly 90 degrees.

Straight angle is 180 degrees, which is a straight line, not a perpendicular intersection. So yeah, right angle has to be the correct choice. I think E is the right answer.

When two lines are perpendicular, they intersect at a 90-degree angle, which is known as a right angle. 

Answer: E
