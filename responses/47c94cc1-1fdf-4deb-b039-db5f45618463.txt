Okay, so I have this question about estimating total rainfall over three months by rounding each month's rainfall to the nearest whole number and then adding them up. Let me think through this step by step.

The rainfall amounts given are 8.1 inches, 4.2 inches, and 0.33 inch. The task is to estimate the total by rounding each to the nearest whole number and then summing them.

First, I'll tackle each month's rainfall separately.

For the first month, it's 8.1 inches. To round to the nearest whole number, I look at the decimal part. Since 0.1 is less than 0.5, I round down. So 8.1 inches rounds to 8 inches.

Next, the second month is 4.2 inches. Again, looking at the decimal, 0.2 is less than 0.5. So this also rounds down to 4 inches.

The third month is 0.33 inches. Here, the decimal is 0.33, which is less than 0.5, so it rounds down to 0 inches. Wait, but 0.33 is almost a third of an inch. Hmm, but the question says to round to the nearest whole number, so 0.33 would indeed round down to 0.

Now, adding them up: 8 + 4 + 0 equals 12 inches. So the estimated total rainfall is 12 inches.

Looking at the options, J is 12 in. So the answer should be J.

The total rainfall is estimated by rounding each month's rainfall to the nearest whole number and summing them. The rounds are 8, 4, and 0 inches, totaling 12 inches.
