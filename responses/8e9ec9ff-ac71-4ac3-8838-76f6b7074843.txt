Okay, so I've got this question about quantization error in signals. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through. The question is asking for the mean-square quantization error when the error is equally likely between -S/2 and +S/2, where S is the step size.

Wait, I remember that quantization error is the difference between the original signal and the quantized one. Since the error is uniformly distributed between -S/2 and S/2, I guess I need to find the average of the squares of these errors.

Mean-square error, right. So mathematically, that's the expected value of the error squared. For a uniform distribution, the mean square error (MSE) can be calculated by integrating the square of the error over the interval and then dividing by the interval's width.

The interval from -S/2 to S/2 has a width of S. The error e can be anywhere in this range, and since it's equally likely, the probability density function (pdf) is constant, 1/S.

The formula for MSE would be the integral from -S/2 to S/2 of (e^2) * (1/S) de, all multiplied by (1/S) because it's the average over the interval.

Wait, no, wait. The formula for the expected value E[e^2] is the integral of e squared times the pdf, which is 1/S over the interval. So:

E[e²] = (1/S) * ∫ from -S/2 to S/2 of e² de.

Let me compute that integral. The integral of e² de is (e³)/3. Evaluated from -S/2 to S/2, that would be [ ( (S/2)^3 )/3 - ( (-S/2)^3 )/3 ].

But wait, (-S/2)^3 is negative because it's an odd power. So ( (S^3/8) )/3 - ( -S^3/8 )/3 ) equals (S^3/24) + (S^3/24) ) = S^3/12.

Then multiply by 1/S, so E[e²] = (S^3/12) * (1/S) ) = S²/12.

Wait, so the mean-square error is S squared over 12. Looking at the options, that's option B: S²/12.

The mean-square quantization error when the error is uniformly distributed between -S/2 and S/2 is calculated by integrating the square of the error over this interval and dividing by the interval's width. The result is S²/12.
