Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two homogeneous cylinders rotating about their own axes. Both have the same material, so their densities are the same. They're rotating at the same angular velocity, omega. The question is about the ratio of their kinetic energies when one cylinder has a radius twice the other. Hmm.

Alright, let's break this down. I remember that the kinetic energy of a rotating object is given by (1/2) I omega squared, where I is the moment of inertia. Since both are rotating at the same angular velocity, the omega squared term will be the same for both, so the kinetic energy ratio will depend on the ratio of their moments of inertia.

Wait, but what's the moment of inertia for a solid cylinder about its central axis? I think it's (1/2) m r squared. Oh right, yes, I = (1/2) m r². So the formula makes sense because for a cylinder, mass is distributed in a way that the moment depends on radius squared.

But wait, the problem says the cylinders are homogeneous, so their masses depend on their volumes. Since they're made of the same material, their densities are the same. So mass is proportional to volume, which for a cylinder is pi r² h, where h is the height. Oh, but wait, the problem doesn't mention the heights. Are they assuming the heights are the same? Or does it not matter?

Hmm, the problem doesn't specify the heights. So perhaps we can assume they have the same height. Because if the heights were different, we wouldn't be able to find a ratio without more information. So I'll assume both cylinders have the same height, h. That makes sense because the problem is about the radius ratio, so other dimensions should be same for comparison.

So if both have the same height, then their volumes are proportional to pi r² h. So the radius of one is twice the other. Let's say the smaller one has radius r, and the larger has radius 2r. Then the volume of the larger is pi (2r)^2 h = pi 4r² h, which is four times the smaller's volume. So since mass is density times volume, and density is same, the mass of the larger is four times the smaller. So m2 = 4 m1, where m1 is the mass of the smaller cylinder.

Wait, but wait. The problem says "homogeneous cylinders made of the same material." So if the height is the same, then the larger radius cylinder has four times the mass of the smaller one. So masses are in the ratio 4:1.

Now, the moment of inertia for each. For the smaller, I1 = (1/2) m1 r². For the larger, I2 = (1/2) m2 (2r)^2. Let's compute that. I2 = (1/2) * 4 m1 * (4 r²) = (1/2) * 16 m1 r² = 8 m1 r².

Wait, no, wait. Wait, m2 is 4 m1, and the radius is 2r. So plugging into I formula: I2 = (1/2) * m2 * (2r)^2. Substituting m2 as 4m1, I2 = (1/2) *4 m1 *4 r². So that's (1/2)*16 m1 r², which is 8 m1 r². And I1 is (1/2) m1 r².

So the ratio I2/I1 is (8 m1 r²) / ( (1/2) m1 r² ) = 16. So I2 is 16 times I1. Wait, that can't be right because I thought the moment of inertia would scale with r² and mass. Let me check again.

Wait, I1 is (1/2) m1 r². I2 is (1/2) m2 (2r)^2. Since m2 =4 m1, I2 = (1/2) *4 m1 *4 r² = (1/2)*16 m1 r² = 8 m1 r². So I2 =8 m1 r², I1= (1/2) m1 r². So I2/I1 = (8 m1 r²) / ( (1/2) m1 r² ) = 16. So I2 is 16 times I1.

Wait, but then the kinetic energy is (1/2) I omega^2, so KE2/KE1 = I2/I1 =16. So the ratio of their kinetic energies is 16:1. So the larger cylinder has 16 times the kinetic energy of the smaller one.

But wait, wait a second. Let me think again. Because the radius is twice, but the mass is four times. So the moment of inertia for the larger is (mass factor) times (radius factor). So (4) * (4) =16. Oh right, that's correct.

So the kinetic energy ratio is KE2:KE1 =16:1, which would be option C.

Wait, looking back at the options, option C is 16:1. So the answer should be C.

The kinetic energy of a rotating object is given by \( KE = \frac{1}{2} I \omega^2 \), where \( I \) is the moment of inertia and \( \omega \) is the angular velocity. For a homogeneous cylinder rotating about its central axis, the moment of inertia is \( I = \frac{1}{2} m r^2 \), where \( m \) is the mass and \( r \) is the radius.

Since both cylinders are made of the same material and rotate at the same angular velocity, the ratio of their kinetic energies depends on the ratio of their moments of inertia. Assuming the cylinders have the same height, their volumes are proportional to \( \pi r^2 h \). Given that the radius of one cylinder is twice the other, the larger cylinder has a volume four times that of the smaller one. Since the density is the same, the mass of the larger cylinder is also four times that of the smaller one (\( m_2 = 4m_1 \)).

The moment of inertia for the smaller cylinder is \( I_1 = \frac{1}{2} m_1 r^2 \). For the larger cylinder, with radius \( 2r \), the moment of inertia is \( I_2 = \frac{1}{2} m_2 (2r)^2 = \frac{1}{2} (4m_1) (4r^2) = 8m_1r^2 \). The ratio of the moments of inertia is:

\[
\frac{I_2}{I_1} = \frac{8m_1r^2}{\frac{1}{2}m_1r^2} = 16
\]

Since the kinetic energy is proportional to the moment of inertia, the ratio of the kinetic energies is also 16:1. Therefore, the correct answer is:

C
