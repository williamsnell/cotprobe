Okay, so I have this question about inductance and resonance. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my electronics, but I'll give it a shot.

The question is asking what inductance is needed to resonate at 10 MHz with a capacitance of 100 pF. The options are from A to J, each giving a different value in microhenries.

First, I remember that resonance in an LC circuit occurs when the inductive reactance equals the capacitive reactance. The formula for the resonant frequency (f) is given by f = 1/(2π√(LC)). Wait, no, wait—that's the formula for the frequency. But wait, I think I might have mixed up the formula. Oh right, the formula is f = 1/(2π√(LC)), where L is inductance and C is capacitance. 

But wait, I'm given the frequency and the capacitance, and I need to find the inductance. So I should rearrange the formula to solve for L. Let me think: starting with f = 1/(2π√(LC)), if I solve for L, I can square both sides first. So (2πf)^2 = 1/(LC). Then, rearranging, L = 1/( (2πf)^2 * C ). Hmm, does that make sense? Let me make sure. Another way: starting with f = 1/(2π√(LC)), so √(LC) = 1/(2πf), then square both sides: LC = 1/( (2πf)^2 ), so L = 1/( (2πf)^2 * C ). Yeah, that seems right.

Now, plugging in the numbers. The frequency f is 10 MHz, which is 10^7 Hz. The capacitance C is 100 pF, which is 100 x 10^-12 farads. Let me write that as 1e-10 farads because 100e-12 is 1e-10.

So, L = 1 / ( (2π * 10^7)^2 * 1e-10 ). Let me compute the denominator step by step.

First, calculate 2π * 10^7. 2π is approximately 6.2832. So 6.2832 * 10^7 is about 6.2832e7. Then, square that: (6.2832e7)^2. Let me compute that.

6.2832 squared is approximately 39.478. So 39.478 multiplied by (1e7)^2, which is 1e14. So 39.478e14. Wait, wait, no: 6.2832e7 squared is (6.2832)^2 * (1e7)^2 = 39.478 * 1e14 = 3.9478e15.

So the denominator becomes 3.9478e15 multiplied by 1e-10. Let me compute that: 3.9478e15 * 1e-10 = 3.9478e5.

So L is 1 divided by 3.9478e5. Let me compute that. 1 / 3.9478e5 ≈ 2.534e-6 henries. Wait, 2.534e-6 is 2.534 microhenries. Looking at the options, J is 2.53 μH. So that would be the answer.

Wait, but wait a second—did I make a mistake in the units? Let me double-check the calculations. Let me redo the calculation step by step.

f = 10 MHz = 10^7 Hz
C = 100 pF = 100 * 1e-12 F = 1e-10 F

Compute 2πf: 2 * π * 1e7 ≈ 6.2832 * 1e7 ≈ 6.2832e7

Square that: (6.2832e7)^2 = (6.2832)^2 * (1e7)^2 = 39.478 * 1e14 = 3.9478e15

Multiply by C: 3.9478e15 * 1e-10 = 3.9478e5

So L = 1 / (3.9478e5) ≈ 2.534e-6 H = 2.534 μH.

Looking at the options, J is 2.53 μH, which is the closest. So the answer should be J.

Wait, but wait another thing—I think I might have confused the formula. Let me make sure I didn't mix up L and C. The formula is f = 1/(2π√(LC)), so solving for L gives L = 1/( (2πf)^2 * C ). Alternatively, another way to write the formula is LC = (1/(2πf))^2. So yes, that's correct.

Alternatively, I could compute the inductive reactance XL at resonance, which equals the capacitive reactance XC. XL = 2πf L, and XC = 1/(2πf C). At resonance, XL = XC, so 2πf L = 1/(2πf C). Solving for L: L = 1/( (2πf)^2 * C ). Yep, same result.

So I'm confident now that the correct inductance is approximately 2.53 μH, which is option J.

To determine the inductance \( L \) required to resonate at 10 MHz with a capacitance of 100 pF, we use the resonance formula:

\[
f = \frac{1}{2\pi\sqrt{LC}}
\]

Rearranging for \( L \):

\[
L = \frac{1}{(2\pi f)^2 C}
\]

Given:
- \( f = 10 \, \text{MHz} = 10^7 \, \text{Hz} \)
- \( C = 100 \, \text{pF} = 100 \times 10^{-12} \, \text{F} = 1 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{F} \)

Substituting into the formula:

\[
L = \frac{1}{(2\pi \times 10^7)^2 \times 1 \times 10^{-10}}
\]

Calculating step-by-step:
1. \( 2\pi \times 10^7 \approx 6.2832 \times 10^7 \)
2. \( (6.2832 \times 10^7)^2 \approx 3.9478 \times 10^{15} \)
3. Multiply by \( C \): \( 3.9478 \times 10^{15} \times 1 \times 10^{-10} = 3.9478 \times 10^5 \)
4. \( L = \frac{1}{3.9478 \times 10^5} \approx 2.534 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{H} = 2.534 \, \mu\text{H} \)

The closest option is **J: 2.53 μH**.
