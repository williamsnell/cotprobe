Okay, so I've got this physics problem about hydrogen bombs and gasoline. Hmm, let me try to break it down.

The question says that in a hydrogen bomb, deuterium nuclei fuse to make helium, releasing 5MeV of energy per deuterium. And we're told that 1/7000 of natural hydrogen is deuterium. We need to find out how many liters of gasoline are needed to burn to produce the same energy as 1 liter of water used in the bomb.

Wait, wait. Wait, the question isn't about the bomb itself, but about comparing the energy from burning gasoline to the energy from the bomb. Specifically, how much gasoline would produce as much energy as 1 liter of water in the bomb.

Let me list the given data:

- Energy per deuterium fusion: 5 MeV per deuterium nucleus.
- Natural H has 1/7000 as D, so the concentration is 1/7000.
- Gasoline's heat of combustion: 5100 kJ per mole.
- Gasoline density: 0.703 g/cm³.
- 1 eV = 1.60 ×10^-19 J.

We need to compare the energy from burning gasoline to the energy from the fusion of deuterium in the water.

First, I think I should find out how much energy is released when 1 liter of water is used. Since water is H₂O, but the fusion is about deuterium, we need to figure out how much deuterium is in 1 liter of water.

Wait, water is H₂O. So one mole of water has 2 moles of H. But only 1/7000 of that is D. So in 1 mole of water, moles of D = (2 * 1/7000) = 2/7000 = 1/3500 moles of D.

But wait, 1 liter of water. Water has a density of about 1 g/cm³, so 1 liter is 1000 cm³, which is 1000 grams. The molar mass of water is 18 g/mol (H=1, O=16; 2*1 +16=18). So 1000 g / 18 g/mol ≈ 55.56 moles of H₂O.

Each mole of H₂O has 2 moles of H, so total H atoms in 1 liter is 55.56 * 2 = 111.11 moles of H. Of these, 1/7000 is D. So moles of D = 111.11 / 7000 ≈ 0.01587 moles of D.

Each D fusion releases 5 MeV. So total energy from 1 liter of water is 0.01587 moles * 5 MeV per mole.

Wait, but wait, 5 MeV per deuterium nucleus. So per mole of D, that's 5 MeV per molecule, so per mole, it's 5 MeV * Avogadro's number. Hmm, but wait, maybe I should compute it correctly.

Wait, 1 mole of D has Avogadro's number (≈6.022e23) of nuclei. Each releases 5 MeV, so total energy per mole is 5 MeV * 6.022e23 ≈ 3.011e24 MeV.

Wait, but wait, no, that's per mole. So 0.01587 moles of D would release:

Energy (MeV) = 0.01587 moles * 5 MeV/mole ≈ 0.07935 MeV.

Wait, but that's in MeV. I need to convert that to joules because the gasoline's energy is given in kJ per mole.

So 1 MeV = 1.602e-13 J (since 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J; so 1 MeV = 1e6 eV = 1.602e-13 J).

So 0.07935 MeV = 0.07935 * 1.602e-13 J ≈ 1.271e-14 J.

Wait, that seems way too small. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, wait, no, I think I messed up the calculation. Let me recalculate.

Wait, 1 liter of water has 1000 grams. Molar mass of H₂O is 18 g/mol, so 1000 / 18 ≈ 55.556 moles of H₂O.

Each mole of H₂O has 2 moles of H atoms, so 55.556 * 2 = 111.11 moles of H. Of these, 1/7000 is D, so moles of D = 111.11 / 7000 ≈ 0.01587 moles of D.

Each D nucleus releases 5 MeV, so total energy from D fusion is 0.01587 mol * 5 MeV/mol = 0.07935 MeV.

Wait, but that's only 0.07935 MeV, which is a very small amount of energy. Let me convert that to joules.

1 MeV = 1.602e-13 J (since 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J, so 1e6 eV = 1.602e-13 J).

So 0.07935 MeV = 0.07935 * 1.602e-13 ≈ 1.271e-14 J.

Wait, that's 1.27e-14 joules. That's a tiny amount of energy. But that can't be right because 1 liter of water in a hydrogen bomb would release a huge amount of energy. Wait, I must have made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait a second, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. The question states that 5 MeV is released per deuterium. So per D nucleus, 5 MeV is released. So the energy per mole of D is 5 MeV * Avogadro's number.

Wait, 5 MeV per D → 5e6 eV per D. So per mole, that's 5e6 eV * 6.022e23 nuclei ≈ 3.011e30 eV.

But wait, 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J, so 3.011e30 eV * 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 4.822e11 J per mole of D.

Wait, but earlier, I found that 1 liter of water has 0.01587 moles of D. So the energy is 0.01587 * 4.822e11 J ≈ 7.62e9 J, which is 7.62 GJ.

Ah, that makes more sense. Because a hydrogen bomb would indeed release a large amount of energy.

So the energy from 1 liter of water is approximately 7.62e9 joules.

Now, we need to find how many liters of gasoline are needed to produce the same energy.

Given that the heat of combustion of gasoline is 5100 kJ per mole. Let's find out how much energy comes from burning gasoline.

First, let's find the moles of gasoline in a liter. The density of gasoline is 0.703 g/cm³. One liter is 1000 cm³, so 0.703 g/cm³ * 1000 cm³ = 703 grams per liter.

Molar mass of C8H18: C is 12, H is 1. So 8*12 =96, 18*1=18 → 114 g/mol.

So moles per liter = 703 g / 114 g/mol ≈ 6.166 moles per liter.

Each mole releases 5100 kJ, so per liter: 6.166 moles * 5100 kJ/mol = 6.166 * 5100 ≈ 31,446.6 kJ, which is 31,446,600 J per liter.

Wait, but wait, no, 5100 kJ per mole is 5.1e6 J per mole. So per liter, 6.166 moles *5.1e6 J/mol ≈ 3.144e7 J per liter.

Wait, but wait, the energy from 1 liter of water is 7.62e9 J, which is way larger. So how many liters of gasoline would we need?

We can set up the equation:

Energy from gasoline = Energy from water

So, (liters of gasoline) * (energy per liter of gasoline) = 7.62e9 J.

Energy per liter of gasoline is 3.144e7 J.

So liters of gasoline = 7.62e9 J / 3.144e7 J/liter ≈ 242.3 liters.

Looking at the options, E is 243 liters. So the answer is E.
</think>

To determine how many liters of gasoline are needed to produce the same energy as 1 liter of water in a hydrogen bomb, we first calculate the energy released by the fusion of deuterium in 1 liter of water.

1. **Energy from 1 liter of water:**
   - 1 liter of water weighs 1000 g.
   - Molar mass of H₂O = 18 g/mol, so moles of H₂O = 1000 / 18 ≈ 55.56 mol.
   - Each mole of H₂O has 2 moles of H, so total moles of H = 55.56 * 2 ≈ 111.11 mol.
   - Fraction of H that is deuterium (D) = 1/7000, so moles of D = 111.11 / 7000 ≈ 0.01587 mol.
   - Each D nucleus releases 5 MeV, so total energy from D fusion = 0.01587 mol * 5 MeV/mol = 0.07935 MeV.
   - Convert MeV to joules: 1 MeV = 1.602e-13 J, so energy = 0.07935 * 1.602e-13 ≈ 1.271e-14 J.

2. **Energy from gasoline:**
   - Heat of combustion of gasoline = 5100 kJ/mol = 5.1e6 J/mol.
   - Density of gasoline = 0.703 g/cm³, so 1 liter (1000 cm³) weighs 703 g.
   - Molar mass of C₈H₁₈ = 114 g/mol, so moles per liter = 703 / 114 ≈ 6.166 mol.
   - Energy per liter of gasoline = 6.166 mol * 5.1e6 J/mol ≈ 3.144e7 J.

3. **Calculate liters of gasoline needed:**
   - Energy from water = 1.271e-14 J.
   - Liters of gasoline = 1.271e-14 J / 3.144e7 J/liter ≈ 4.04e-22 liters.

This result is unreasonably small, indicating a miscalculation. Re-evaluating, the correct energy from 1 liter of water is approximately 7.62e9 J. Dividing this by the energy per liter of gasoline (3.144e7 J) gives approximately 243 liters of gasoline.
