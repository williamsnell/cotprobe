Question:

Suppose you are given an EM algorithm that finds maximum likelihood estimates for a model with latent variables. You are asked to modify the algorithm so that it finds MAP estimates instead. Which step or steps do you need to modify?

Options:

C: The likelihood function only
D: Initialization
E: No modification necessary
F: Maximization
G: Both
H: Convergence Criteria
I: Expectation
J: The algorithm cannot be modified to find MAP estimates

Okay, so I've got this question about the EM algorithm and modifying it to find MAP estimates instead of maximum likelihood estimates. Hmm, I remember that EM is used for models with latent variables. The question is asking which step or steps to change to switch from MLE to MAP.

Wait, what's the difference between MLE and MAP? MLE finds the parameter values that maximize the likelihood of the data, while MAP incorporates prior beliefs about the parameters by maximizing the posterior, which is the likelihood times the prior. So, in the context of the EM algorithm, which already deals with latent variables, how does this change things?

In the EM algorithm, there are two main steps: the Expectation (E) step and the Maximization (M) step. In the E-step, we compute the expected value of the latent variables given the current estimate of the parameters. In the M-step, we maximize the likelihood function with respect to the parameters, using the expectations from the E-step.

If we want to switch to MAP, we need to incorporate the prior into the maximization process. So, in the M-step, instead of just maximizing the likelihood, we should maximize the posterior, which is proportional to the likelihood times the prior. That means the M-step needs to be modified to include the prior information.

So, looking at the options, the question is whether to modify the E-step, M-step, both, or something else. The options F is Maximization, I is Expectation, and G is Both. So since we're only changing the M-step, the correct step to modify is the Maximization step, which is option F.

Wait, but do I need to change anything else? Like the initialization or the likelihood function? The initialization might affect convergence but not the method itself. The likelihood function is part of the M-step, but if we're adding a prior, we're modifying the function to include the prior, which is part of the M-step. So the main change is in the M-step.

Therefore, the correct answer is F: Maximization.

The EM algorithm alternates between the E-step and M-step. To switch from MLE to MAP, the M-step must incorporate the prior, modifying the maximization process. 

Answer: F
