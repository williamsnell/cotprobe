Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about noroviruses and the symptoms they typically cause. I'm a bit rusty on my virology, but let's think this through step by step.

First, I remember that noroviruses are a group of viruses that cause gastrointestinal illnesses. They're often associated with what's called the "stomach flu," right? Wait, no, that's actually a different thing because the flu is from influenza viruses. Noroviruses are known for causing outbreaks in places like cruise ships, schools, and hospitals. So, they probably cause symptoms related to the digestive system.

Looking at the options:

A: High fever and cough. Hmm, that sounds more like a respiratory infection, maybe the flu or a cold. Noroviruses are more about the gut, so maybe not A.

B: Severe headache and muscle pain. I'm not too sure, but I don't recall noroviruses causing headaches as a primary symptom. More about the stomach, so probably not B.

C: Disease of the central nervous system. Noroviruses aren't typically CNS-invading, I think. They target the GI tract, so C is unlikely.

D: Loss of taste and smell. That sounds more like COVID-19 symptoms or maybe other viral infections, but I don't think noroviruses cause that. So D is probably not it.

E: Projectile vomiting and diarrhoea. Oh, this rings a bell. Norovirus infections are famous for causing sudden, violent vomiting and diarrhea. I've heard of outbreaks where people get really sick with these symptoms. So E seems very likely.

F: Rash. Rashes are common in other viral infections like measles or chickenpox, but noroviruses don't typically cause rashes. So F is probably not the answer.

G: Rash and fever. Again, combining rash and fever points more towards other viruses. Noroviruses are about the gut, so G is unlikely.

H: Diarrhoea. Well, H is just diarrhea, and while that's a symptom, I think norovirus is more known for causing both vomiting and diarrhea together. So E includes both, which is more specific.

I: Breathlessness and chest pain. These are more respiratory issues, possibly from COVID or asthma, not norovirus. So I don't think I is correct.

J: Persistent hiccups and diarrhoea. Persistent hiccups aren't a common symptom of norovirus that I know of. The main issue is usually the gastrointestinal symptoms, so J is probably not right.

Putting it all together, the symptoms that stand out are projectile vomiting and diarrhea, which is option E. So I'm pretty confident that E is the correct answer.

The correct answer is E: Projectile vomiting and diarrhoea.

Answer: E
