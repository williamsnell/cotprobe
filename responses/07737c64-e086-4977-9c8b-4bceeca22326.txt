Question:

An ancient Egyptian mummy is found. A count of the radiationemitted from the C^14 in the body is only one eighth thatfound in persons who have died recently. About how old isthe mummy? (The half-life of C^14 is 5568 years.)

Options:

A: 16,704 years old
B: 8,284 years old
C: 6,420 years old
D: 20,136 years old
E: 13,500 years old
F: 22,176 years old
G: 4,500 years old
H: 18,950 years old
I: 27,840 years old
J: 11,136 years old

Okay, so I've got this question about carbon dating an ancient Egyptian mummy. Hmm, I remember that carbon-14 is used to determine the age of organic materials. The question says that the radiation emitted from C^14 is only one eighth that found in recently deceased people. I need to find out how old the mummy is, given that the half-life of C^14 is 5568 years.

Wait, half-life is the time it takes for half of the radioactive isotope to decay, right? So each half-life, the amount of C^14 decreases by half. If the mummy's C^14 is one eighth of the recent amount, that means it's gone through a few half-lives.

Let me think. If I start with 100% of C^14, after one half-life (5568 years), it's 50%. After two half-lives, it's 25%, and after three, it's 12.5%. Wait, but the question says it's one eighth, which is 12.5% as well. Oh wait, no—wait, one eighth is 12.5%, which is the same as three half-lives because each half-life cuts it in half again. So 1/2, then 1/4, then 1/8.

So the number of half-lives passed is three. To calculate the age, I multiply the number of half-lives by the half-life period. So 3 times 5568 years. Let me do the math: 5568 * 3. Hmm, 5000*3 is 15,000, and 568*3 is 1,704. Adding them together gives 16,704 years.

Looking at the options, option A is 16,704 years. So that must be the answer.

The radiation emitted by C^14 is one eighth of the recent amount, indicating three half-lives have passed. Each half-life of C^14 is 5568 years, so 3 × 5568 = 16,704 years.
