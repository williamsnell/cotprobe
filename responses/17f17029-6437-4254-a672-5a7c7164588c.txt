Answer the following multiple choice question, selecting from the answer A through to J. After thinking, reply directly with your answer. 

The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

List and compare the tissues that support and hold together theother tissues of the body.

Options:

A: Connective tissue is a single group of tissues that encapsulates organs without providing structural support.
B: The only function of connective tissue is to transport nutrients throughout the body.
C: Connective tissue is divided into two groups: bone and cartilage.
D: Connective tissue includes three types: muscle, nerve, and epithelial tissues.
E: Connective tissue is mainly composed of fluids and lacks solid structures like bone or cartilage.
F: Connective tissue functions to support and hold together structures of the body. They are classified into four groups by structure and/or function: bone, cartilage, blood, and fibrous connective tissue.
G: Connective tissue is categorized into five groups: bone, cartilage, blood, fibrous connective tissue, and adipose tissue.
H: Fibrous connective tissue doesn't contribute to the support and holding of other tissues.
I: Connective tissue only supports other tissues, it doesn't hold them together.
J: Connective tissues are not classified; all connective tissues have the same function and structure.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about connective tissues, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me start by breaking down the question and each option.

The question is asking to list and compare the tissues that support and hold together other tissues of the body. So, I'm thinking about connective tissues because I remember they play a role in supporting and connecting other body tissues.

Looking at the options, A through J, each makes a statement about connective tissues. I need to identify which one is accurate.

Option A says connective tissue is a single group that encapsulates organs without providing structural support. Wait, that doesn't sound right. Connective tissues are known for providing structural support, like in bones and cartilage. So A might be incorrect because it says they don't provide structural support.

Option B claims the only function is to transport nutrients. That doesn't seem right. I know connective tissues have various functions, including support, protection, and even immune functions in some cases. So B is probably wrong.

Option C says connective tissue is divided into bone and cartilage. That can't be right because I remember there are more types, like blood and fibrous tissues. So C is too limited.

Option D states connective tissue includes muscle, nerve, and epithelial tissues. No, those are different types of tissues. Connective is separate, so D is wrong.

Option E says connective tissue is mainly fluid and lacks solid structures. That's incorrect because bone and cartilage are solid and part of connective tissues. So E is wrong.

Option F says connective tissue functions to support and hold structures. It's classified into four groups: bone, cartilage, blood, and fibrous. That sounds correct because I've heard about these four types in my studies. They each serve different supportive roles.

Option G includes five groups: bone, cartilage, blood, fibrous, and adipose. Wait, adipose is a type of connective tissue, but I'm not sure if it's considered a separate classification group. I think it's sometimes included, but maybe the main four are more standard.

Option H says fibrous connective doesn't contribute to support. That's not true; fibrous tissues like tendons and ligaments support joints. So H is wrong.

Option I says connective tissues only support, not hold together. That's incorrect because they do both. So I is wrong.

Option J says connective tissues aren't classified, which is false because they are classified into various types. So J is wrong.

So between F and G. F lists four groups: bone, cartilage, blood, fibrous. G adds adipose as a fifth. I think traditionally, connective tissues are divided into four categories, but sometimes adipose is included as a subtype of fibrous or as its own. I'm not entirely sure, but the question asks about the main groups. I think F is more accurate because it's the standard four.
