Alright, let's try to figure out this physics problem. Okay, so the question is about finding the acceleration when a force acts on a mass. Hmm, I remember from school that Newton's laws are involved here. Oh right, Newton's second law states that force equals mass times acceleration, F = ma. So I can rearrange that to find acceleration, which would be a = F/m.

Wait, the units in the question are a bit tricky. The force is given as 0.20 newtons, which is straightforward. But the mass is 100 grams. Oh, right, I need to convert grams to kilograms because the standard unit for mass in physics is kilograms. 

So, 100 grams is equal to 0.1 kilograms. Because 1 kilogram is 1000 grams, so 100 divided by 1000 is 0.1. Got it.

Now, applying the formula a = F/m. The force is 0.20 N, and mass is 0.1 kg. Plugging in the numbers: a = 0.20 / 0.1. Let me do that division. 0.2 divided by 0.1 is 2. So the acceleration should be 2.0 m/s².

Looking at the options, option C is 2.0 m/sec². So that's the answer. Let me double-check my steps. Units converted correctly? Yes, grams to kilograms. Correct formula? Yes, a = F/m. Calculation right? 0.2 divided by 0.1 is indeed 2. So I'm confident that C is the right choice.

The force acting on the mass is 0.20 N, and the mass is 100 grams, which converts to 0.1 kg. Using Newton's second law, \( a = \frac{F}{m} = \frac{0.20}{0.1} = 2.0 \, \text{m/s}^2 \). 

Answer: C
