Question:

Given a two-dimensional array AMATR which contains 10 rows and 10 columns and a one-dimensional array called DIAG which contains 10 elements, write a program segment in FORTRAN to compute the elements of D1AG from DIAG(I) = AMATR(I, I) for I =1,2,.. .,10. Then compute the trace of AMATR, which is defined as trace(AMATR) = 10\sum_i= 1AMATR(I, I) = 10\sum_i= 1DIAG(I).

Options:

A: DIMENSION AMATR(10,10), DIAG(10)
B: DIMENSION AMATR (10,10), DIAG (10) TRACE = 1.0 DO 100 I = 1,10 DIAG (I) = AMATR (I, I) TRACE = TRACE + DIAG (I) 100CONTINUE STOP END
C: DIMENSION AMATR (10,10), DIAG (10) TRACE = 0.0 DO 100 I = 1,10 DIAG (I) = AMATR (I, I) TRACE = TRACE - DIAG (I) 100CONTINUE STOP END
D: DIMENSION AMATR (10,10), DIAG (10) TRACE = 0.0 DO 100 I = 1,10 DIAG (I) = AMATR (I, I) TRACE = TRACE * DIAG (I) 100CONTINUE STOP END
E: DIMENSION AMATR (10,10), DIAG (10) TRACE = 0.0 DO 100 I = 1,10 DIAG (I) = AMATR (I, I) TRACE = TRACE + DIAG (I) 100CONTINUE STOP END

Okay, so I've got this FORTRAN question to solve. Let me read it carefully.

The problem says: We have a 2D array AMATR with 10 rows and 10 columns. Then there's a 1D array called DIAG with 10 elements. The task is to write a program segment that computes each element of DIAG from AMATR's diagonal elements. So DIAG(I) should be equal to AMATR(I, I) for each I from 1 to 10. After that, we need to compute the trace of AMATR, which is the sum of all the diagonal elements. The trace is defined here as 10 times the sum of the diagonals, but wait, that doesn't make sense because normally the trace is just the sum. Oh, maybe it's a typo in the question, but I'll proceed with the given steps.

Looking at the options, all start with the DIMENSION statement, which is correct. So the first part is to extract the diagonal elements.

Now, the main part is about computing the trace. The trace is the sum of the diagonal elements. So in the code, we should have a variable that starts at 0, then for each I, add the value of AMATR(I,I) to it.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Just declares the dimensions, no computation. So it's incomplete. Not the answer.

Option B: Initializes TRACE to 1.0, then in the loop adds DIAG(I) to it. Wait, but the first step is to compute each DIAG(I). So in the loop, for each I, DIAG(I) is set to AMATR(I,I), and then that value is added to TRACE. So after the loop, TRACE would be the sum of all the diagonal elements. But the option says 10\sum_i=1, which I'm not sure about. Wait, the question says trace is 10 times the sum, but that seems odd. Wait, maybe it's a typo because the trace is the sum, so I think the correct code should sum the diagonal elements.

Option B's code starts with TRACE=1.0, then adds each DIAG(I). So after 10 iterations, it would have 1.0 + sum(DIAG). That's not right because the sum should be the trace, not adding 1.0. So option B might not be correct.

Option C: Initializes TRACE to 0.0, then subtracts each diagonal element. That would make the trace negative, which doesn't make sense. So probably not.

Option D: Initializes TRACE to 0.0, then multiplies each diagonal element. So after the loop, TRACE would be the product of all diagonals, which isn't the trace. So D is incorrect.

Option E: Initializes TRACE to 0.0, adds each diagonal element. So after the loop, TRACE is the sum of the diagonals, which is correct for the trace.

So the steps are:

1. Compute each diagonal element of AMATR into DIAG.
2. Sum all elements of DIAG to get the trace.

Looking at the options, option E correctly initializes TRACE to 0, then in the loop, sets DIAG(I) to AMATR(I,I) and adds it to TRACE. So after the loop, TRACE holds the sum of the diagonals, which is the trace.

The other options have issues: B adds 1.0, which is wrong. C subtracts, D multiplies, which are incorrect operations for the trace.

The correct approach is to compute each diagonal element of AMATR into DIAG and then sum these elements to get the trace. Option E does this correctly.

Answer: E
