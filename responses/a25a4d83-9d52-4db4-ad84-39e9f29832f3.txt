Answer:
    
<think>
Alright, so I have this thermodynamics problem here about a real gas and its enthalpy and entropy changes along an isothermal path between two pressures, P1 and P2. The equation given is v = (RT/P) + b - (a/RT), where a and b are constants. I need to find the change in enthalpy (h2 - h1)_T and entropy (s2 - s1)_T for an isothermal process.

Okay, let's start by breaking down what I know. Enthalpy and entropy are state functions, so their changes depend only on the initial and final states, not the path taken. Since the process is isothermal, the temperature T is constant along the path.

First, I should recall the general expressions for the partial derivatives of enthalpy and entropy with respect to pressure at constant temperature. For enthalpy, the differential is dH = T dS + V dP. So, the change in enthalpy at constant temperature would be (∂H/∂P)_T multiplied by the change in pressure, ΔP.

Similarly, for entropy, the differential is dS = (∂S/∂P)_T dP + (∂S/∂T)_P dT. But since T is constant, the second term drops out, and we're left with (∂S/∂P)_T multiplied by ΔP.

So, I need to compute (∂H/∂P)_T and (∂S/∂P)_T using the given equation of state.

The equation of state is v = (RT)/(P) + b - (a)/(RT). Let me write that as v = RT/(P) + (bRT - a)/RT. Wait, no, perhaps it's better to express it as v = (RT/P) + b - (a)/(RT), so v = (RT)/(P) + b - a/(RT).

Wait, maybe I can write this more neatly. Let me rearrange it:

v = (RT)/(P) + b - (a)/(RT) → v = RT/(P) + b - a/(RT). So v is expressed in terms of P, R, T, a, and b.

To find (∂H/∂P)_T, I know that for enthalpy, the partial derivative at constant T is (∂H/∂P)_T = V - T(∂V/∂T)_P. But wait, since T is constant, perhaps I can directly find dV/dP at constant T.

Wait, no. Let me think again. Actually, the general expression is (∂H/∂P)_T = V - T(∂V/∂T)_P. But since T is constant, (∂V/∂T)_P is evaluated at constant P. But wait, maybe there's a better way.

Alternatively, I can use the thermodynamic identity for H. H = U + PV, so dH = dU + P dV + V dP. And dU at constant T is T dS. So, dH = T dS + V dP. Therefore, (∂H/∂P)_T = V + T (∂S/∂P)_T. Hmm, but I don't have S yet. Maybe another approach.

Wait, perhaps it's better to use the equation of state to find (∂V/∂P)_T and then find (∂H/∂P)_T.

Given v = RT/P + b - a/(RT), which I can write as v = (RT)/(P) + (bRT - a)/RT. Wait, actually, perhaps I can write it as v = RT/(P) + b - a/(RT).

Let me find V as a function of P. V = (RT)/P + b - a/(RT). So, it's a function of P. At constant T, let's compute ∂V/∂P.

∂V/∂P = d/dP [ RT/P + b - a/(RT) ] = RT*(-1/P²) + 0 + 0 = -RT / P².

So, (∂V/∂P)_T = - RT / P².

Now, to find (∂H/∂P)_T. From thermodynamics, we have:

(∂H/∂P)_T = V - T (∂V/∂T)_P.

Wait, but I think another approach is to use the general relation for H in terms of V and P, but perhaps I can express (∂H/∂P)_T using V and (∂V/∂P)_T.

Alternatively, perhaps another identity could be more useful here. Let me think: for a process at constant T, dH = (∂H/∂P)_T dP + (∂H/∂V)_T dV. Hmm, but maybe it's better to find (∂H/∂P)_T directly.

Wait, perhaps using the relation H = U + PV. So, dH = dU + P dV + V dP. At constant T, dU = T dS. So,

dH = T dS + V dP + P dV.

But also, from the first law, dU = T dS - P dV. So, perhaps substituting that into the expression for dH.

Wait, maybe I'm complicating things. Let me look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps the equation of state can be used to express H in terms of P and T, and then take the derivative.

Alternatively, I remember that for an ideal gas, (∂H/∂P)_T = 0, but this is a real gas, so that's not the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that for a general gas, (∂H/∂P)_T = V - T (∂V/∂T)_P.

But since the process is isothermal, perhaps (∂V/∂T)_P at constant P can be found from the equation of state.

Wait, let's compute (∂V/∂T)_P. From V = RT/P + b - a/(RT).

Taking derivative with respect to T at constant P:

dV/dT = R/P + 0 + (a)/(R T²).

So, (∂V/∂T)_P = R/P + a/(R T²).

Now, plugging this into the expression for (∂H/∂P)_T:

(∂H/∂P)_T = V - T*(∂V/∂T)_P.

Substituting V and (∂V/∂T)_P:

V = RT/P + b - a/(RT).

So,

(∂H/∂P)_T = [RT/P + b - a/(RT)] - T [ R/P + a/(R T²) ].

Expanding this:

= RT/P + b - a/(RT) - T*(R/P) - T*(a)/(R T²).

Simplify each term:

RT/P cancels with -T*(R/P), since T*(R/P) = RT/P. So, RT/P - RT/P = 0.

Then, we have:

= b - a/(RT) - T*(a)/(R T²).

Simplify the last term:

T * a/(R T²) = a/(R T).

So,

= b - a/(RT) - a/(RT) = b - 2a/(RT).

So, (∂H/∂P)_T = b - 2a/(RT).

Wait, but that seems a bit confusing. Let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, let's redo the expansion step carefully:

(∂H/∂P)_T = V - T*(∂V/∂T)_P.

V = RT/P + b - a/(RT).

T*(∂V/∂T)_P = T*( R/P + a/(R T²) ) = T*(R/P) + T*(a)/(R T²) ) = RT/P + a/(R T).

So,

(∂H/∂P)_T = [RT/P + b - a/(RT)] - [RT/P + a/(R T)].

Simplify:

RT/P cancels with -RT/P.

Then, b - a/(RT) - a/(RT) = b - 2a/(RT).

Yes, correct. So, (∂H/∂P)_T = b - (2a)/(RT).

Now, the change in enthalpy when moving from P1 to P2 at constant T is:

ΔH = (∂H/∂P)_T * (P2 - P1) = [b - (2a)/(RT)] (P2 - P1).

So, (h2 - h1)_T = [b - (2a)/(RT)] (P2 - P1).

Wait, looking at the options, I need to see which option matches this.

Now, looking at the options:

Option D: (h2 - h1)_T = [b - (2a/RT)] (P2 - P1), and entropy part is ... let me check.

Option D says (h2 - h1)_T = [b - (2a/RT)] (P2 - P1), and (s1 - s2)_T = - R ln(P1/P2) - [a(P1-P2)]/(R T²).

Wait, let me look at the options more carefully.

Wait, the options have (h2 - h1)_T as the first part. So, in our case, it's [b - 2a/(RT)] (P2 - P1). So, the coefficient is correct in option D, but let me check the other options.

Option I: (h2 - h1)_T = [b - (2a/RT)] (P2 - P1). So, same as D.

Wait, wait, let me check all the options:

A: ... (P1 - P2) → so (h2 - h1) would be negative, but our result is positive (P2 - P1). So A is (P1-P2), which would give negative.

Option B: [b - 3a/RT] (P2-P1).

Option C: [b -a/RT] (P2-P1).

Option D: [b - 2a/RT] (P2-P1).

Option E: [b + 2a/RT] (P1-P2).

Option F: [b - 2a/RT] (P1-P2).

Option G: [b + 2a/RT] (P2-P1).

Option H: [b +2a/RT] (P2-P1).

Option I: [b -2a/RT] (P2-P1).

Option J: [b +a/RT] (P2-P1).

Wait, so both D and I have the same h term. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the sign somewhere.

Wait, the change is from P1 to P2, so if P2 is higher than P1, the change would be positive. So, in our calculation, (h2 - h1) is [b - 2a/RT] (P2 - P1).

So, looking for an option where (h2 - h1)_T is [b - 2a/RT] multiplied by (P2 - P1). So, options D and I have that.

Now, let's look at the entropy change. The entropy change for an isothermal process can be found using (∂S/∂P)_T.

Using the equation of state, we can find (∂S/∂P)_T.

From thermodynamics, we have:

dS = (∂S/∂P)_T dP + (∂S/∂T)_P dT.

At constant T, dT=0, so dS = (∂S/∂P)_T dP.

To find (∂S/∂P)_T, we can use the relation involving enthalpy. Remember that for a process at constant T, dH = T dS + V dP.

So, rearranging, dS = (dH/(T)) - (V dP)/T.

But for a process at constant T, dH = (∂H/∂P)_T dP, so:

dS = [ (∂H/∂P)_T / T ] dP - [V / T ] dP.

Combine the terms:

dS = [ (∂H/∂P)_T - V ] / T dP.

Therefore, (∂S/∂P)_T = [ (∂H/∂P)_T - V ] / T.

We already have (∂H/∂P)_T = b - 2a/(RT), and V = RT/P + b - a/(RT).

So,

[ (∂H/∂P)_T - V ] = [ b - 2a/(RT) ] - [ RT/P + b - a/(RT) ]

Simplify:

= b - 2a/(RT) - RT/P - b + a/(RT)

= (- RT/P) - (2a/(RT) - a/(RT)) )

= (- RT/P ) - a/(RT)

So,

[ (∂H/∂P)_T - V ] = - RT/P - a/(RT)

Thus,

(∂S/∂P)_T = [ - RT/P - a/(RT) ] / T = [ - RT/(P T) - a/(R T^2) ]

Simplify:

= - R/(P) - a/(R T² )

So,

(∂S/∂P)_T = - R/(P) - a/(R T² )

Therefore, the entropy change when moving from P1 to P2 is:

ΔS = (∂S/∂P)_T (P2 - P1) = [ - R/P - a/(R T²) ] (P2 - P1).

But wait, let me write it as:

ΔS = ∫(from P1 to P2) (∂S/∂P)_T dP = ∫ (from P1 to P2) [ - R/P - a/(R T²) ] dP.

Integrating term by term:

∫ - R/P dP = - R ln(P) + C.

∫ - a/(R T²) dP = - a/(R T²) * P + C.

So, evaluating from P1 to P2:

ΔS = [ - R ln(P2) + (- a P2)/(R T²) ] - [ - R ln(P1) + (- a P1)/(R T²) ]

= - R ln(P2) + R ln(P1) - a/(R T²) (P2 - P1)

= R ln(P1/P2) - [ a (P2 - P1) ] / (R T² )

Alternatively, this can be written as:

ΔS = R ln(P1/P2) + [ a (P1 - P2) ] / (R T² )

Which is the same as:

ΔS = - R ln(P2/P1) + [ a (P1 - P2) ] / (R T² )

But looking back, I think I made a mistake in the sign when integrating. Let's redo the integration step carefully.

The integral of - R/P dP from P1 to P2 is:

- R ∫ (1/P) dP from P1 to P2 → - R [ ln P ] from P1 to P2 → - R ( ln P2 - ln P1 ) ) → - R ln (P2/P1 ) → R ln (P1/P2 )

The integral of - a/(R T²) dP from P1 to P2 is:

- a/(R T²) ∫ dP from P1 to P2 → - a/(R T²) (P2 - P1) → - a (P2 - P1)/(R T² )

So, putting it together:

ΔS = R ln(P1/P2) - [ a (P2 - P1) ] / (R T² )

Which can be rewritten as:

ΔS = - R ln(P2/P1) + [ a (P1 - P2) ] / (R T² )

Alternatively, factor out the negative sign in the second term:

ΔS = - R ln(P2/P1) - [ a (P2 - P1) ] / (R T² )

Because [ a (P1 - P2) ] = - a (P2 - P1).

So, the entropy change is:

(s2 - s1)_T = [ R ln(P1/P2) ] - [ a (P2 - P1) ]/(R T² )

But looking at the options, the entropy change is given as (s1 - s2)_T, which would be the negative of (s2 - s1)_T.

So,

(s1 - s2)_T = - [ R ln(P1/P2) - a (P2 - P1)/(R T²) ) ] = - R ln(P1/P2) + [ a (P2 - P1) ]/(R T² )

Alternatively,

= R ln(P2/P1) + [ a (P2 - P1) ]/(R T² )

Wait, let me confirm that.

If (s2 - s1)_T = R ln(P1/P2) - [ a (P2 - P1) ]/(R T² ), then (s1 - s2)_T = - (s2 - s1)_T = - R ln(P1/P2) + [ a (P2 - P1) ]/(R T² ).

Which can be written as R ln(P2/P1) + [ a (P2 - P1) ]/(R T² ), because -ln(a/b) = ln(b/a).

So,

(s1 - s2)_T = R ln(P2/P1) + [ a (P2 - P1) ]/(R T² )

Alternatively, if the options have (s1 - s2)_T, perhaps expressed differently.

Wait, let me look back at the options.

Looking at option D:

(s1 - s2)_T = - R ln(P1/P2) - [a (P1 - P2) ]/(R T² )

Simplify:

- R ln(P1/P2) is R ln(P2/P1).

And [a (P1 - P2)] = -a (P2 - P1), so the second term becomes - [ -a (P2 - P1) ]/(R T² ) → a (P2 - P1)/(R T² )

So, (s1 - s2)_T = R ln(P2/P1) + a (P2 - P1)/(R T² )

Which matches what I have.

Now, looking at the options:

Option D says:

(s1 - s2)_T = - R ln(P1/P2) - [a (P1 - P2)]/(R T² )

Which is the same as R ln(P2/P1) + [a (P2 - P1)]/(R T^2 )

Yes, correct.

So, combining both results:

(h2 - h1)_T = [b - 2a/(RT)] (P2 - P1 )

(s1 - s2)_T = R ln(P2/P1) + [a (P2 - P1)]/(R T² )

Now, let's look at the options again.

Option D:

(h2 - h1)_T = [b - (2a)/(RT)] (P2 - P1 )

(s1 - s2)_T = - R ln(P1/P2) - [a (P1 - P2)]/(R T² )

Which is the same as R ln(P2/P1) + [a (P2 - P1)]/(R T² )

So, yes, option D matches both the enthalpy and entropy changes.

Wait, but looking again, option I has the same h term as D, but entropy part is:

(s1 - s2)_T = - R ln(P2/P1) - [a (P2 - P1)]/(R T^2 )

Which would be the negative of what we have. So, that's incorrect.

Option D's entropy is:

- R ln(P1/P2) - [a (P1 - P2)]/(R T² )

Which is equal to R ln(P2/P1) + [a (P2 - P1)]/(R T^2 ), which matches our result.

So, option D is correct.
</think>

The enthalpy change is calculated using the partial derivative of enthalpy with respect to pressure at constant temperature, which yields \((\partial H / \partial P)_T = b - \frac{2a}{RT}\). The entropy change is derived from the partial derivative of entropy with respect to pressure at constant temperature, resulting in \((\partial S / \partial P)_T = -\frac{R}{P} - \frac{a}{RT^2}\). Integrating these expressions between \(P_1\) and \(P_2\) gives the changes in enthalpy and entropy. The correct option matches both results.

Answer: D
