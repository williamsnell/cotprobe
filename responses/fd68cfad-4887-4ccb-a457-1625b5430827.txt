Okay, let's try to solve this problem step by step. So, we have nine bags of bird feed initially in the storage room. Then, more bags are being delivered each day from Monday to Friday. I need to find out the total number of bags by the end of the week.

First, I'll note down the initial number and the deliveries each day. 

Starting with Monday: 17 bags are delivered. So I'll add that to the initial nine. Let me calculate that: 9 + 17 = 26. Wait, no, wait, that's just Monday. Then Tuesday adds 22 bags. So after Tuesday, it would be 26 + 22. Let me add those: 26 + 22 is 48. Hmm, maybe I should write all the days and their deliveries down.

Wait, maybe a better approach is to sum all the deliveries first and then add them to the initial nine. Let's list out each day's delivery:

Monday: 17
Tuesday: 22
Wednesday: 3
Thursday: 11
Friday: 18

I'll add these numbers together. Let's start adding:

17 (Monday) + 22 (Tuesday) = 39.

Then, 39 + 3 (Wednesday) = 42.

42 + 11 (Thursday) = 53.

53 + 18 (Friday) = 71.

Wait, that can't be right because 17+22 is 39, plus 3 is 42, plus 11 is 53, plus 18 is 71. So total deliveries from Monday to Friday are 71 bags.

Now, add the initial nine bags: 9 + 71 = 80.

Looking at the options, option D is 80. So the answer should be D.

Wait, but let me double-check my addition to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Let me add the deliveries again:

Monday: 17
Tuesday: 22 → 17+22=39
Wednesday: 3 → 39+3=42
Thursday: 11 → 42+11=53
Friday: 18 → 53+18=71

Yes, that's correct. Then 71 +9=80. So D is the right answer.

The total number of bags delivered from Monday to Friday is 71, plus the initial 9 bags equals 80. 

Answer: D
