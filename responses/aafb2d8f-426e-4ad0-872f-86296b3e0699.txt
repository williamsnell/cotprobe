<think>
Okay, so I've got this question about the two-period binomial model for stock prices, and I need to find the current price of a one-year American put option with a strike price of $80. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I remember that in the binomial model, we consider the possible stock prices at each period. Since it's a two-period model, each period is 6 months, so the time to maturity for the option is one year, which is two periods.

The current stock price is $70.00, and it can either go up or down each period. The up factor (u) is 1.181, and the down factor (d) is 0.890. So, after the first period, the stock can be at 70 * 1.181 or 70 * 0.890. Let me calculate those.

First period up: 70 * 1.181 = let's see, 70*1 is 70, 70*0.181 is about 12.67, so total is around 82.67.

First period down: 70 * 0.890 = 62.30.

Now, in the second period, each of these can go up or down again. So after two periods, the possible stock prices are:

From 82.67: 82.67 * 1.181 ≈ let me calculate that. 82.67 * 1 is 82.67, 82.67 * 0.181 is approximately 15.00, so total is around 97.67.

From 82.67 down: 82.67 * 0.890 ≈ 73.74.

From 62.30 up: 62.30 * 1.181 ≈ 73.74.

From 62.30 down: 62.30 * 0.890 ≈ 55.51.

Wait, but since it's a two-period model, I think we only need to consider the possible prices at each node. Maybe I should draw the binomial tree.

At time 0: 70.

After period 1: up to 82.67, down to 62.30.

After period 2: from 82.67, up to 82.67*1.181≈97.67, down to 82.67*0.890≈73.74. From 62.30, up to 62.30*1.181≈73.74, down to 62.30*0.890≈55.51.

So the possible stock prices at time 2 are 97.67, 73.74, and 55.51.

But wait, the put option is American, so we can exercise it at any time, including early. So we need to consider the value of the option at each node, both at expiration and any earlier time.

The strike price is $80, so the option gives the holder the right to sell the stock at $80. The put's payoff is max(80 - S, 0).

First, let's compute the payoffs at expiration (time 2). For each possible S:

If S = 97.67, put payoff is 0 because 80 < 97.67.

If S =73.74, 80 -73.74 =6.26.

If S=55.51, 80 -55.51=24.49.

So at time 2, the payoffs are 0, 6.26, 24.49.

But wait, in the binomial tree, each node has two possibilities, so the payoffs at time 2 would be at each leaf node. So for each possible path, we have to consider the payoff.

Now, we need to find the expected payoff at time 2, then discount it back to the present using the risk-free rate. But since this is an American option, we also need to check whether it's optimal to exercise early.

Wait, but in the two-period model, we can compute the option price using backward induction. So starting from time 2, compute the payoff, then work back to time 0.

But let me think in terms of the binomial tree. Let me outline the steps:

1. At time 2 (expiry), calculate the payoff for each possible S.

2. For each node at time 1, calculate the expected payoff, then decide whether to exercise or not. Since it's American, we can choose to exercise early if it's beneficial.

3. Then, at time 0, calculate the expected value of the option, considering the two possible S prices at time 1, and their respective probabilities.

But wait, in the binomial model, do we use risk-neutral probabilities? Yes, I think so. The risk-neutral probability (p) is calculated as [ (e^(rΔt) - d) / (u - d) ], where r is the risk-free rate, continuously compounded. Since r is given as 5%, and each period is 6 months, Δt is 0.5 years.

So let me calculate p.

First, e^(rΔt) = e^(0.05 *0.5) = e^0.025 ≈ 1.025315.

Then, p = (1.025315 - d)/(u - d).

Given d=0.89, u=1.181.

So p = (1.025315 - 0.89)/(1.181 - 0.89) = (0.135315)/(0.291) ≈ 0.465.

So p ≈ 0.465, and 1-p = 0.535.

Wait, let me compute that more accurately.

1.025315 - 0.89 = 0.135315.

1.181 - 0.89 = 0.291.

0.135315 / 0.291 ≈ let's calculate:

0.135315 ÷ 0.291 ≈ 0.465 (since 0.291 * 0.465 ≈ 0.1353). So p≈0.465.

Now, let's build the tree step by step.

At time 2 (expiry), the payoffs are:

- If S=97.67, payoff=0.

- If S=73.74, payoff=6.26.

- If S=55.51, payoff=24.49.

Wait, but each node at time 1 leads to two outcomes at time 2. So for the node at 82.67 (time 1 up), it can go to 97.67 or 73.74. For the node at 62.30 (time 1 down), it can go to 73.74 or 55.51.

So for each node at time 1, we need to compute the expected payoff, considering the risk-neutral probabilities, and then decide whether to hold or exercise early.

Wait, but for an American option, we can choose to exercise at any time, so we need to compare the option's value if exercised immediately versus its value if held.

Let me start by computing the payoffs at time 2.

At time 2:

- If S=97.67, payoff=0.

- If S=73.74, payoff=6.26.

- If S=55.51, payoff=24.49.

Now, let's compute the expected payoff for each node at time 1.

First, the node at S=82.67 (time 1 after up move):

From here, in the next period, it can go up to 97.67 with probability p=0.465, or down to 73.74 with probability 1-p=0.535.

The expected payoff at time 2 is:

(0.465 * 0) + (0.535 * 6.26) ≈ 0 + 3.3531 ≈ 3.3531.

But wait, the option can be exercised at time 1 (after the first period) if it's beneficial. So at S=82.67, we can compute the immediate payoff: max(80 - 82.67, 0) = 0. So if we exercise here, we get 0. Alternatively, we can hold the option, which has an expected value of 3.3531 at time 2. Since 3.3531 is higher than 0, we would prefer to hold, so the value at S=82.67 is 3.3531.

Wait, no, that's not quite right. The expected payoff from time 2 is 3.3531, but we have to discount it back to time 1. Because the option's value at time 1 is the present value (at time 1) of the expected payoff from time 2.

Wait, no, the risk-neutral valuation already incorporates the discounting. Let me think again.

Actually, in the binomial model, when calculating the expected payoff at time 1, we compute the average of the two possible payoffs at time 2, each multiplied by their respective probabilities, and then discount it back to time 1 using the risk-free rate.

Wait, no, perhaps I should structure it as follows.

At each node, the value of the option is the maximum between the immediate exercise value and the expected future value discounted at risk-free rate.

Wait, perhaps I should model this step by step.

Let me outline the steps for the put option.

First, build the binomial tree for the stock prices.

Then, for each node, starting from the end, compute the option's value.

At time 2 (expiry), the value is max(80 - S, 0).

Then, for each node at time 1, compute:

V1 = max(80 - S1, e^(-rΔt) * [p * V1_up + (1-p) * V1_down])

Wait, no, more accurately, for each node at time 1, the value is the maximum between exercising immediately (which gives max(80 - S1, 0)) and the expected future value discounted at the risk-free rate.

So, for each node at time 1, the option's value is max(exercise_value, expected_future_payoff_discounted).

So let's compute this for each node at time 1.

First, the node at S=82.67 (time 1 up):

Exercise value: max(80 - 82.67, 0) = 0.

Expected future payoff: at time 2, if up, S=97.67, payoff=0. If down, S=73.74, payoff=6.26.

So the expected payoff is p*0 + (1-p)*6.26 = 0.465*0 + 0.535*6.26 ≈ 3.3531.

Then, discount this back to time 1 using the risk-free rate. Since each period is 6 months, the discount factor is e^(-rΔt) = e^(-0.05*0.5) ≈ 1 / 1.025315 ≈ 0.97545.

So the expected future payoff discounted is 3.3531 * 0.97545 ≈ 3.3531 * 0.97545 ≈ let's compute:

3.3531 * 0.97545 ≈ approximately 3.265.

So the value at S=82.67 is the max between 0 and 3.265, which is 3.265.

Now, the node at S=62.30 (time 1 down):

Exercise value: max(80 - 62.30, 0) = 17.70.

So if we exercise here, we get 17.70.

Alternatively, the expected future payoff from time 2: from S=62.30, it can go up to 73.74 (payoff 6.26) or down to 55.51 (payoff 24.49).

So expected payoff is p*6.26 + (1-p)*24.49.

Wait, no, p is the probability from the parent node. Wait, no, in this case, from S=62.30, which is the down move from time 0 to 1, the next period's up and down moves are from S=62.30.

So the expected payoff is p*24.49 + (1-p)*6.26? Wait, no, wait: when S=62.30, the next period can go up to 73.74 or down to 55.51. So the payoffs are 6.26 (if S=73.74) and 24.49 (if S=55.51).

Wait, no, because at time 2, the payoffs are:

If S=73.74, payoff=80-73.74=6.26.

If S=55.51, payoff=80-55.51=24.49.

So for the node at S=62.30, the expected payoff is p*6.26 + (1-p)*24.49.

Wait, but p is the same as before, 0.465.

So expected payoff = 0.465*6.26 + 0.535*24.49.

Let me compute that:

0.465 * 6.26 ≈ 2.911.

0.535 *24.49 ≈ 13.093.

Total ≈ 2.911 + 13.093 ≈ 16.004.

Now, discount this to time 1: 16.004 * e^(-0.05*0.5) ≈ 16.004 * 0.97545 ≈ approx 15.607.

So the value at S=62.30 is the max between exercising (17.70) and holding (15.607). So we choose the higher value, which is 17.70.

Wait, but wait, that's not right. Because the expected payoff is 16.004, which when discounted is 15.607. But if we exercise now at S=62.30, we get 17.70. So 17.70 is higher than 15.607, so we would exercise immediately. Therefore, the value at S=62.30 is 17.70.

Now, moving up to time 0.

The node at S=70 (time 0) can go up to 82.67 or down to 62.30.

So the expected payoff at time 1 is p * V_up + (1-p) * V_down.

Where V_up is the value at S=82.67, which is 3.265.

V_down is the value at S=62.30, which is 17.70.

So expected payoff is 0.465 * 3.265 + 0.535 * 17.70.

Compute each term:

0.465 *3.265 ≈ 1.519.

0.535 *17.70 ≈ 9.4595.

Total ≈ 1.519 +9.4595 ≈ 10.9785.

Now, discount this back to time 0: 10.9785 * e^(-0.05*0.5) ≈ 10.9785 * 0.97545 ≈ approx 10.716.

Wait, but that's the expected payoff at time 0. But wait, no—since this is the expected payoff at time 1, we need to discount it to time 0.

Wait, but in the binomial model, the option's value at time 0 is the expected payoff at time 1, discounted to time 0.

Wait, but let me clarify: the value at time 0 is the present value of the expected payoff at time 1, which we've computed as 10.9785, discounted by e^(-rΔt), which is 0.97545.

So 10.9785 * 0.97545 ≈ 10.716.

But wait, that seems low. Let me check my calculations again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the expected payoff at time 1.

Let me recompute:

At S=82.67, the value is 3.265.

At S=62.30, the value is 17.70.

So expected payoff at time 1 is 0.465*3.265 + 0.535*17.70.

Compute 0.465 *3.265:

3.265 * 0.465: 3 *0.465=1.395, 0.265*0.465≈0.123225. Total≈1.518225.

0.535 *17.70: 17.70 *0.5=8.85, 17.70 *0.035≈0.6195. Total≈9.4695.

Sum: 1.518225 +9.4695 ≈ 10.9877.

Discounted to time 0: 10.9877 * 0.97545 ≈ let's compute.

10.9877 * 0.97545 ≈ approx 10.72.

Hmm, but looking at the options, the closest is option I:10.75.

But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of the expected payoff at time 1.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the expected payoff at time 1 is the average of the two possible values, each multiplied by their probabilities, and then we take the present value.

But in the case of the American option, we have to consider whether to exercise early, so perhaps my approach was correct.

Wait, but let me double-check the value at S=62.30.

At S=62.30, the exercise value is 17.70.

The expected future payoff is 0.465*6.26 +0.535*24.49.

Compute that:

0.465 *6.26 ≈ 2.911.

0.535 *24.49 ≈ 13.093.

Total ≈ 16.004.

Discounted to time 1: 16.004 * e^(-0.05*0.5) ≈ 16.004 * 0.97545 ≈ approx 15.607.

Since 17.70 >15.607, we choose to exercise, so the value at S=62.30 is 17.70.

Similarly, at S=82.67, the expected future payoff after discounting is 3.265, and the exercise value is 0, so we take 3.265.

Then, the expected value at time 1 is 0.465*3.265 +0.535*17.70 ≈10.9877.

Discounted to time 0: 10.9877 *0.97545 ≈10.72.

Looking at the options, option I is 10.75, which is very close. So perhaps the answer is I:10.75.

Wait, but let me check if I made any calculation errors.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for the put option in the binomial model.

Another approach is to use the formula for the American put option price in a two-period binomial model.

The formula is:

C = e^(-rT) [ p*C_u + (1-p)*C_d ]

But for American options, we have to check whether early exercise is optimal.

In this case, the option is a put, so the decision to exercise early depends on whether the intrinsic value is higher than the discounted expected future value.

In our calculations, at S=62.30, exercising gives 17.70, which is higher than the discounted expected future value of 15.607, so we exercise.

At S=82.67, the exercise value is 0, so we hold.

So our calculation seems correct, leading to the option price of approximately 10.72, which rounds to 10.75, option I.
</think>

To determine the current price of the one-year American put option with a strike price of $80, we use the two-period binomial model. Each period is 6 months, and the risk-free rate is continuously compounded at 5%. The stock price starts at $70 and can either go up by a factor of \( u = 1.181 \) or down by \( d = 0.890 \) each period. The possible stock prices at each node are calculated, and the payoffs of the put option at expiration are determined. Using risk-neutral probabilities, we compute the expected payoffs at each node, considering the option's value if exercised early or held. The risk-neutral probability \( p \) is calculated as \( p = \frac{e^{r\Delta t} - d}{u - d} \approx 0.465 \). Starting from the expiration (time 2), we work backward to compute the option's value at each node. At the node where the stock price is $62.30, early exercise is optimal, yielding a value of $17.70. At the node where the stock price is $82.67, holding the option yields a higher value of approximately $3.265. The expected payoff at time 1 is calculated as \( 0.465 \times 3.265 + 0.535 \times 17.70 \approx 10.9877 \), which is then discounted to time 0 using \( e^{-r\Delta t} \approx 0.97545 \), resulting in an option price of approximately $10.72. Rounding to the nearest option, the answer is:

I: 10.75
