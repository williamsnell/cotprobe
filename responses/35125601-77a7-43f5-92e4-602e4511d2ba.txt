Okay, so I need to figure out the answer to this multiple-choice question. Let's read it carefully.

The question is about concurrent individual and group therapy. It says that while some patients might need both, many therapists don't support it. The main concern they have is one of the options given. My task is to pick the correct option from A to J, but looking at the options, it's only up to E. Wait, the options are A to E, but the user wrote up to J, but the actual options are A-E. So I can focus on those.

The question is asking why therapists might be concerned about offering both individual and group therapy at the same time. So, the concern is probably about something negative that could happen when a patient is in both therapies concurrently.

Let me go through each option:

A: Screening procedures for patients may be ignored because a therapist is recommending the group experience. Hmm. Screening procedures are important to determine if a patient is suitable for group therapy. If the therapist ignores them, that could be a problem. But I'm not sure if this is the main concern about concurrent therapy.

B: Patients beginning with a group, finding additional sources of support, tend to terminate the individual therapy prematurely. So, if a patient finds support in the group, they might stop individual therapy early. That could be a problem because the individual therapy might be necessary for deeper issues. This seems plausible.

C: Patients wait until they are in their individual sessions before reacting to what occurred in the group. So, they don't process group experiences until individual therapy. I'm not sure if this is a concern. Maybe it's more about processing in the moment, but I'm not certain.

D: Patients become reliant on group therapy, ignoring individual therapy sessions. If they rely too much on group, they might neglect individual sessions. That could be a problem because individual therapy provides personalized attention. This is another possible answer.

E: Patients use their two therapists’ words to refute group members’ suggestions for behavior change. So, they might use what one therapist says against the other. That could lead to confusion or manipulation, which is a concern.

Now, I need to think which of these is the major concern. The question says that therapists don't support concurrent therapy because of a major concern.

I think about what issues arise when doing both therapies together. One issue is potential interference between the two. For example, if a patient is in both, they might prioritize one over the other or use one to avoid the other.

Option B says patients might terminate individual therapy early because they found support in the group. That could be a problem because individual therapy might be crucial for their specific issues.

Option D suggests reliance on group therapy, which might mean they skip individual sessions. That also seems problematic.

Option E is about using two therapists' words against each other, which could cause conflict or confusion.

I'm trying to remember if there's any literature or common concerns about concurrent therapy. I think one concern is that the group might provide enough support that the patient doesn't engage fully in individual therapy, leading them to drop it early. That would point to option B.

Alternatively, maybe patients might become too dependent on the group, making individual therapy less effective. That would be option D.

Wait, another angle: in concurrent therapy, the patient is seeing two therapists, which could complicate things. Maybe the patient might feel they have two sources of support and don't need to continue individual therapy, thus dropping it early. That's option B.

But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again. The question says "many therapists do not support it," so the concern is likely a significant issue that makes them oppose it.

Another thought: group therapy can be supportive, but if a patient finds it more helpful, they might feel they don't need individual therapy anymore. That could lead to premature termination of individual therapy, which is a concern for therapists because they might feel their work isn't being continued properly.

So, I think option B is the correct answer.

The correct answer is B. Therapists may be concerned that patients in concurrent individual and group therapy might terminate individual therapy prematurely if they find additional support in the group setting.

Answer: B
