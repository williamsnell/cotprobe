Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which of these options would NOT be a barrier to the diffusion of a cultural trait. The question is asking which one is NOT a barrier, so I need to think about each option and whether it actually hinders the spread of culture.

Let me start by recalling what I know about cultural diffusion. Cultural traits can spread through various means, like migration, trade, or imitation. Barriers to diffusion could be physical, like mountains or oceans, or social, like language differences or religious beliefs.

Looking at the options:

A: Mountain ranges. Physical geography. Mountains can be hard to traverse, so they can act as barriers. Makes sense as a barrier.

B: Oceans. Similarly, large bodies of water can be difficult to cross, so they would slow down or prevent diffusion. So yes, a barrier.

C: Religion. Different religions can create social barriers. If a group is strongly tied to their religion, they might resist adopting cultural traits from another group with a different religion. So religion is a barrier.

D: Tolerant complaisant citizens. Hmm. "Tolerant" means they accept others, and "complaisant" means they are willing to comply or adapt. If a group is like that, they might be more open to adopting cultural traits. So this would NOT be a barrier because it facilitates diffusion rather than hindering it.

E: Distance. The farther apart groups are, the harder it is for their cultures to mix. So distance is definitely a barrier.

F: Dense forests. Physical obstacle again. Dense areas can impede movement and communication, so they act as barriers.

G: Language. Different languages can make it harder for ideas and culture to spread. If people don't speak the same language, communication is a barrier. So yes, language is a barrier.

So the question is which is NOT a barrier. From the above, D is the one that's not a barrier because it's about people being open and accepting, which helps cultural traits diffuse, not hinder them.
