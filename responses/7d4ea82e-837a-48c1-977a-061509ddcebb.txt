Question:

What was the importance of peace research during the 1980s?

Options:

A: Peace research was inter-disciplinary and politically orientated with immediate policy responsibility accountable to the major powers of the political system.
B: There was a distance from policy responsibility but European security studies gained political relevance due to the politicization of security issues during the period defined by the peace movement.
C: The importance of peace research was largely due to its focus on economic stability, rather than political or military issues.
D: The setting was simultaneously informed by political theory as the dominant discipline and isolated from developments in theory in the different disciplines.
E: Peace research was not relevant during the 1980s due to the lack of major conflicts.
F: Peace research was primarily used for the development of military strategies during the period of the Cold War.
G: There was an increased focus on peace research due to the rise in global terrorism.
H: The importance of peace research was diminished as it was seen as too theoretical and not applicable to real-world situations.

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about the importance of peace research during the 1980s. I'm going to try to think through this step by step.

First, I need to understand what the question is asking. It's about the significance or role of peace research in that specific decade. The options are A through J, but in the question, it's listed as A through H. Let me read each option carefully.

Option A: Peace research was inter-disciplinary and politically orientated with immediate policy responsibility accountable to the major powers of the political system. Hmm, inter-disciplinary makes sense because peace research often draws from various fields like politics, sociology, etc. Politically orientated too, since it deals with issues like war and peace. But the part about immediate policy responsibility to major powersâ€”does that fit the 1980s?

Option B: There was a distance from policy responsibility but European security studies gained political relevance due to the politicization of security issues during the period defined by the peace movement. So, this suggests that while peace research wasn't directly tied to policy-making, it influenced European security studies because security became a political issue, especially with the peace movement active. The 1980s had the nuclear freeze movement, which was a big part of the peace movement. That might make sense.

Option C: The importance was due to focus on economic stability. I don't think that's right because peace research is more about conflict and cooperation, not economics. So probably not C.

Option D: Setting informed by political theory but isolated from other disciplines' developments. That doesn't sound right because I know peace research is interdisciplinary, so it wouldn't be isolated. So D is unlikely.

Option E: Peace research wasn't relevant due to lack of major conflicts. But the 1980s had the Cold War, which was a significant period with proxy wars and the arms race. So E doesn't make sense.

Option F: Used for military strategies during the Cold War. That might be part of it, but peace research often critiques military approaches, so I'm not sure F is the best choice.

Option G: Focus on peace research due to global terrorism rise. Terrorism wasn't as prominent in the 1980s as it became later, so G might not fit.

Option H: Importance diminished because too theoretical. I don't think so because the 1980s were a time when peace studies were growing, especially with the Cold War context.

Now, thinking about the 1980s context: It was a time of the Cold War, with the nuclear threat being high. The peace movement was active, pushing for disarmament and peaceful solutions. European security studies would have been relevant because of NATO and the Warsaw Pact tensions. Peace research probably looked at how political decisions affect security and vice versa. So Option B seems plausible because it mentions the politicization of security issues and the European context, which aligns with the Cold War environment.

Option A talks about policy responsibility to major powers, but peace research might have been more critical and less directly aligned with government policies, especially if they were pushing for alternatives. So A might not capture the full picture.

So I'm leaning towards Option B: There was a distance from policy responsibility but European security studies gained political relevance due to the politicization of security issues during the period defined by the peace movement.

The 1980s were marked by the Cold War, with significant political tensions and the rise of the peace movement, particularly the nuclear freeze movement. During this period, peace research gained relevance as it addressed the politicization of security issues, especially in Europe. While it maintained a critical distance from direct policy-making, it influenced European security studies by examining the interplay between political decisions and security dynamics. This aligns with the idea that peace research was politically relevant without being immediately tied to the major powers' policies.

Answer: B
