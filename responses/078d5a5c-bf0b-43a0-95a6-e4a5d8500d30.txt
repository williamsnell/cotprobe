Question:

The Lincoln Theater had been showing old films for two months. Admission was $2.00 and average daily attendance was 200. Then, the owner decided to present a recent blockbuster film. Admission price was raised to $4.00 to cover the cost of the new film and average daily attendance rose to 600. Does this example cast doubt upon the law of demand?

Options:

A: The demand curve is upward-sloping
B: The admission price increase caused the demand to rise
C: The law of demand predicts constant attendance regardless of price
D: The demand curve is perfectly inelastic
E: The law of demand is disproved
F: The law of demand is irrelevant in this scenario
G: The law of demand only applies to goods, not services
H: The change in attendance is due to factors other than price
I: The law of demand remains intact
J: The increase in attendance was a coincidence unrelated to the price change

Answer:

Okay, so I have this economics question about the law of demand and a scenario involving the Lincoln Theater. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, I remember that the law of demand states that, generally, as the price of a good or service increases, the quantity demanded decreases, and vice versa. It's the classic downward-sloping demand curve. But I need to see if the example given challenges this law.

In the scenario, the Lincoln Theater was showing old films for two months. The admission was $2, and average daily attendance was 200. Then they switched to a recent blockbuster, raised the price to $4, and attendance went up to 600. So, when the price increased from $2 to $4, attendance more than tripled. That's an increase in quantity demanded as price went up, which seems counter to the law of demand.

Wait, but maybe there's more to it. The owner changed the movie to a blockbuster. So perhaps the change in demand isn't just due to the price but also because the product itself is different. Blockbusters are more popular, so people might be willing to pay more to see them. So the demand curve here might not be the same as before because the quality or the movie itself has changed.

Or maybe the demand for old films versus new blockbusters is different. The initial demand for old films at $2 was 200 per day, but when they switched to a blockbuster, even with a higher price, more people came. So the price increase and the change in the product both affected the attendance. The law of demand looks at the relationship between price and quantity, assuming all else equal. But in this case, the product changed, so other factors are at play.

So the question is whether this casts doubt on the law of demand. The law of demand is about the inverse relationship between price and quantity demanded, holding other factors constant. Here, the owner changed the film, which is a change in the product quality or type, so other factors aren't constant. Therefore, the increase in attendance might not be due solely to the price change but to other factors like the movie's popularity.

Looking at the options, option H says the change in attendance is due to factors other than price. That makes sense because the owner introduced a different film, which could attract more people regardless of the price. So this doesn't violate the law of demand because the law assumes ceteris paribus (all else equal). Since other factors changed, the example doesn't cast doubt on the law of demand.

Option A suggests the demand curve is upward-sloping, which would mean demand increases as price increases. But that's not the case here because the demand curve's shape depends on the product. The example doesn't provide enough info to conclude the curve is upward-sloping; it's more about a different product.

Option B says the price increase caused demand to rise, but again, the change in movie type is a factor. So it's not just the price causing the demand rise.

Option E says the law is disproved, but that's not the case because the law holds when other factors are constant. Here, factors changed, so the law isn't violated.

Option I says the law remains intact. That's probably correct because the scenario doesn't violate the law when considering other variables. The law of demand is still valid; it's just that other factors influenced the demand here.

So I'm leaning towards either H or I. The question asks if the example casts doubt upon the law of demand. If the demand curve is upward-sloping, that would contradict the law, but the scenario doesn't give enough info to conclude that. Instead, it's more about other factors affecting demand. Therefore, the law remains intact because the example doesn't contradict it when considering that other variables changed.

Wait, but the law of demand is about the relationship between price and quantity, assuming other things are equal. If other things aren't equal, then the example doesn't challenge the law. So the law isn't disproven; it's just that in this case, other factors changed, so the demand increased despite the price increase. Therefore, the law still holds because the scenario doesn't violate the ceteris paribus condition.

So the correct answer is I: The law of demand remains intact.

The law of demand states that, holding all else constant, an increase in price leads to a decrease in quantity demanded. In this scenario, the Lincoln Theater increased the admission price from $2 to $4, and attendance rose from 200 to 600. However, the owner also switched from showing old films to a recent blockbuster, which is a significant change in the product offered. This shift in the type of film could independently influence attendance, as blockbusters are often more appealing to audiences. Therefore, the increase in attendance may not solely be due to the price change but also to the change in the product. Since the law of demand assumes all else is constant, the example does not contradict the law because other factors (such as the movie's popularity) are at play. Thus, the law of demand remains intact.
