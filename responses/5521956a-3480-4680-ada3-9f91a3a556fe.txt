Question:

A teacher sets up a reward system for her elementary school students. At the end of each day, she gives a sticker to each student who showed up on time that morning. At the end of each week, she gives a sticker to any student who got above a 90% on three quizzes in a row. After months of this regimen, she finds that performance on the quizzes has increased significantly but that tardiness has only decreased slightly. Which of the following best explains the teacher’s observation?

Options:

A: The students had more intrinsic motivation to do well on quizzes than to show up on time.
B: The students' behavior change was stronger in response to a variable-ratio schedule than it was to a continuous reinforcement schedule.
C: The students were more excited about the quizzes than about the reward system.
D: The students' behavior change was stronger in response to a variable-interval schedule than it was to a fixed-ratio schedule.
E: Variable ratio schedules create the strongest responses and behavior that is the least susceptible to extinction.
F: The students’ behavior change was stronger in response to a fixed-ratio schedule than it was to a continuous reinforcement schedule.
G: The students' behavior change was weaker in response to a fixed-ratio schedule than it was to a continuous reinforcement schedule.
H: The students' behavior change was stronger in response to a fixed-interval schedule than it was to a continuous reinforcement schedule.
I: The students' behavior change was stronger in response to a continuous reinforcement schedule than it was to a variable-ratio schedule.
J: The students’ behavior change was stronger in response to a fixed-ratio schedule than it was to a variable-interval schedule.

Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is about a teacher using a reward system for her students. She gives stickers each day to students who showed up on time. Then, at the end of each week, she gives a sticker to any student who got above 90% on three quizzes in a row. After some months, the quizzes have improved a lot, but tardiness only decreased a little. We need to figure out why.

Hmm, I remember from psychology that there are different types of reinforcement schedules. So, the teacher is using two different reward systems here. One is daily for punctuality, and the other is weekly based on quiz performance.

So, let's think about the schedules. For the stickers given each day for arriving on time, that's probably a continuous reinforcement schedule. Because every time the student does the behavior (showing up on time), they get a reward. That's consistent and immediate.

Then, for the quizzes, the teacher gives a sticker at the end of the week for three quizzes in a row above 90%. So that's a bit more complex. Let's see, the student needs to get three quizzes in a row above 90% to get the sticker. That sounds like a fixed-ratio schedule because after a certain number of desired responses (three quizzes), they get the reward. But wait, actually, it's a bit different because it's three in a row. So maybe it's a variable-ratio because the number isn't fixed? Or is it fixed because it's exactly three?

Wait, no. If the requirement is three quizzes in a row, then every time they do three, they get a reward. So that's a fixed-ratio schedule because the number is fixed (three quizzes). The teacher is reinforcing after every three correct responses.

Now, the outcomes: quizzes improved a lot, meaning the performance-based reward was effective. But tardiness only decreased slightly, so the daily reward for punctuality wasn't as effective. So why would one schedule work better than the other?

I think it has to do with how effective different reinforcement schedules are. From what I remember, variable-ratio schedules create the strongest response and are least susceptible to extinction. Fixed-ratio and continuous reinforcement are less effective.

Wait, but in this case, the quiz reward is fixed-ratio (three in a row). The daily punctuality is continuous reinforcement because every time they show up on time, they get a sticker. So the quiz reward is fixed-ratio, and the tardiness is continuous.

But according to the results, the quiz performance improved a lot, meaning the fixed-ratio schedule was effective. Tardiness only decreased a little, meaning the continuous reinforcement wasn't as effective. So why is that?

Wait, maybe I got it backwards. Let me think again. The question says that performance on quizzes increased significantly, so the fixed-ratio worked well. Tardiness only decreased slightly, so the continuous reinforcement didn't work as well. So why is continuous reinforcement less effective than fixed-ratio?

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because I thought continuous reinforcement is the most basic and effective. Or maybe it's the other way around.

Alternatively, perhaps the teacher's approach is using different schedules for different behaviors. The daily on-time arrival is a continuous reinforcement, and the weekly quiz is a fixed-ratio. But the quiz performance improved more, so maybe the fixed-ratio is more effective than continuous.

Wait, but why? Maybe because the fixed-ratio requires more consistent behavior, so the students are more motivated to achieve that. Or perhaps the variable-ratio is even more effective than fixed-ratio.

Wait, the options mention variable-ratio and others. Let me look at the options again.

Option B says the students' behavior change was stronger in response to a variable-ratio schedule than to a continuous reinforcement. But in this case, the quiz is fixed-ratio, not variable. So maybe the correct option is about fixed-ratio vs continuous.

Wait, but the quiz is fixed-ratio (three in a row) and the punctuality is continuous. So if the quiz schedule is fixed-ratio and it's more effective, that would mean fixed-ratio is better than continuous. But I thought variable-ratio is the strongest.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me clarify. The different reinforcement schedules:

1. Continuous Reinforcement: every response is reinforced. This creates a high response rate but can lead to rapid extinction when the reinforcement stops.

2. Fixed-Ratio: reinforcement after a set number of responses. This leads to high and steady response rates, and extinction takes longer.

3. Variable-Ratio: reinforcement after an unpredictable number of responses. This creates the highest and most consistent response rate, and extinction is very slow.

So, in the question, the teacher uses continuous reinforcement for punctuality (every on-time arrival gets a sticker). For quizzes, it's fixed-ratio: three in a row above 90% get a sticker. So the quiz uses fixed-ratio, and punctuality uses continuous.

The results: quiz performance improved a lot (fixed-ratio worked well), but punctuality only slightly (continuous didn't work as well). So why is that?

Because variable-ratio is more effective than fixed-ratio, which is more effective than continuous. So if the teacher had used variable-ratio for quizzes, it might have been even better. But in this case, fixed-ratio for quizzes was better than continuous for punctuality.

Wait, but the question is why performance on quizzes increased a lot but tardiness only a little. That suggests that the schedule for quizzes was more effective. So which schedule is more effective, fixed-ratio or continuous? Since fixed-ratio is more effective than continuous, that explains why quizzes improved more.

But looking at the options, which one fits this scenario.

Option I says: The students’ behavior change was stronger in response to a continuous reinforcement schedule than to a variable-ratio schedule. But that's the opposite of the scenario.

Option F: The students’ behavior change was stronger in response to a fixed-ratio schedule than to a continuous reinforcement schedule. That makes sense because the quiz (fixed-ratio) had a bigger impact than punctuality (continuous).

Wait, but the question is about why quizzes improved a lot and tardiness only slightly. So the quiz schedule (fixed-ratio) was more effective than the continuous for punctuality. So the answer would be that the behavior change was stronger for fixed-ratio than continuous.

Looking at the options:

Option F: Fixed-ratio > continuous.

Option I: Continuous > variable-ratio (doesn't fit).

So the correct answer would be F: The students’ behavior change was stronger in response to a fixed-ratio schedule than it was to a continuous reinforcement schedule.

Wait, but I thought variable-ratio is the strongest. So why isn't the answer about variable-ratio? Because in this case, the quizzes are fixed-ratio, not variable. So the quiz schedule is fixed-ratio, which is more effective than continuous.

Yes, so the answer should be F.
</think>

The teacher uses two different reinforcement schedules: continuous reinforcement for punctuality (a sticker every day for arriving on time) and fixed-ratio reinforcement for quiz performance (a sticker after three quizzes in a row above 90%). The results show that quiz performance improved significantly, while tardiness only decreased slightly. This indicates that the fixed-ratio schedule for quizzes was more effective in modifying behavior than the continuous reinforcement schedule for punctuality. Fixed-ratio schedules are generally more effective than continuous reinforcement schedules because they lead to higher and more consistent response rates.

Answer: F
