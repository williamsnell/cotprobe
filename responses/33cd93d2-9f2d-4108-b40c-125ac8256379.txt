Okay, so I've got this problem here about an automobile producing CO gas, and I need to figure out how many moles of CO are produced per mile. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the problem says the car is traveling at 10 miles per hour and produces 0.33 pounds of CO gas per mile. Wait, no, actually, the speed might be a red herring here because the question is about per mile. So maybe the speed doesn't matter because it's asking per mile, not per hour. Hmm, so perhaps I can ignore the 10 mph part since it's about per mile.

So the key data is 0.33 pounds of CO per mile. I need to convert that into moles. Right, because the question is asking for moles of CO, not pounds. So I think I need to find out how many moles are in 0.33 pounds of CO.

I remember that to convert between mass and moles, I need the molar mass of CO. Carbon monoxide, CO, is made up of one carbon atom and one oxygen atom. The atomic mass of carbon is about 12.01 g/mol, and oxygen is about 16.00 g/mol. Adding those together, the molar mass of CO should be 12.01 + 16.00 = 28.01 g/mol.

Wait, so 1 mole of CO weighs 28.01 grams. But the problem gives the mass in pounds. Oh, right, I need to convert pounds to grams because the molar mass is in grams.

I know that 1 pound is approximately 453.592 grams. So 0.33 pounds would be 0.33 multiplied by 453.592 grams. Let me calculate that. 0.33 * 453.592. Hmm, 0.33 times 450 is about 148.5, and 0.33 times 3.592 is roughly 1.185, so total is around 149.685 grams. Wait, more accurately, 0.33 * 453.592 = let me compute it properly. 453.592 * 0.3 = 136.0776, and 453.592 * 0.03 = 13.60776. Adding them together gives 136.0776 + 13.60776 = 149.68536 grams. So approximately 149.685 grams of CO per mile.

Now, to find out how many moles that is, I divide the mass by the molar mass. So moles = mass (g) / molar mass (g/mol). So that's 149.685 g / 28.01 g/mol. Let me calculate that.

Dividing 149.685 by 28.01. Let me see, 28.01 times 5 is 140.05, and 28.01 times 5.3 would be 28.01 *5 =140.05, plus 28.01 *0.3=8.403, so total 148.453. Hmm, so 5.3 moles would give about 148.453 grams. But we have 149.685 grams. So the difference is 149.685 -148.453 = 1.232 grams. So 1.232 grams divided by 28.01 g/mol is approximately 0.044 moles. So total moles would be around 5.3 + 0.044 = 5.344 moles per mile.

Looking at the options, option A is 5.4 moles per mile, which is very close to my calculation of approximately 5.34. So I think option A is the correct answer.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Oh, wait, another thing: the problem says 0.33 lb per mile. Did I convert that correctly to grams? Let me confirm. 0.33 lb * 453.592 g/lb = 0.33 * 453.592. Let me compute that again: 453.592 * 0.3 is 136.0776, and 453.592 * 0.03 is 13.60776. Adding them gives 149.68536 grams. So that's correct.

Then, dividing that by 28.01 g/mol: 149.68536 / 28.01. Let me do this division more accurately. 28.01 * 5 =140.05. Subtract that from 149.68536, we get 9.63536. Now, 28.01 goes into 9.63536 how many times? 28.01 * 0.34 â‰ˆ9.52374. So 0.34 times. So total is 5.34. So approximately 5.34 moles per mile. The closest option is A:5.4 moles per mile. So yes, that's the right choice.

To determine the number of moles of CO produced per mile, we start with the given data: the automobile produces 0.33 pounds of CO per mile. Since the question asks for moles, we need to convert the mass from pounds to grams and then use the molar mass of CO to find the number of moles.

1. **Convert pounds to grams**:  
   \( 0.33 \, \text{lb} \times 453.592 \, \text{g/lb} = 149.685 \, \text{g} \).

2. **Determine the molar mass of CO**:  
   The molar mass of CO is calculated as:  
   \( \text{Molar mass of C} = 12.01 \, \text{g/mol} \),  
   \( \text{Molar mass of O} = 16.00 \, \text{g/mol} \),  
   \( \text{Molar mass of CO} = 12.01 + 16.00 = 28.01 \, \text{g/mol} \).

3. **Calculate the number of moles**:  
   Using the formula \( \text{moles} = \frac{\text{mass (g)}}{\text{molar mass (g/mol)}} \),  
   \( \text{moles} = \frac{149.685 \, \text{g}}{28.01 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 5.34 \, \text{moles per mile} \).

4. **Compare with the options**:  
   The closest option to \( 5.34 \, \text{moles per mile} \) is **A: 5.4 moles per mile**.
