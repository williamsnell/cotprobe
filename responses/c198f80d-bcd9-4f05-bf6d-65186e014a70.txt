Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how much Mr. Fields will get from the insurance after the fire damage. Let me break it down step by step. 

First, Mr. Fields's house is worth $30,000, and he has a fire insurance policy for $20,000. The policy has an 80% coinsurance clause. I remember that coinsurance is about the proportion of coverage relative to the value of the property. So, the idea is that the insured has to cover a certain percentage themselves, and the insurance covers the rest, but only up to the policy limit.

Wait, how does the 80% coinsurance work exactly? I think it means that the insured person must cover 80% of the loss themselves, and the insurance covers the remaining 20%. Or is it the other way around? No, wait, coinsurance is usually a ratio that determines the portion the insurance will pay. So the coinsurance percentage is 80%, which I believe is the ratio of the insurance amount to the total value. So, the formula is coinsurance = policy limit / property value. 

So in this case, the policy is $20,000, and the house is $30,000. So 20,000 divided by 30,000 is 0.666, which is about 66.67%, not 80%. Hmm, that seems conflicting. Wait, maybe I'm getting it wrong. Coinsurance clauses are often expressed as a percentage, say 80%, which means the insured has to cover 80% of the loss, and the insurance covers the remaining 20%. But I'm not so sure.

Wait no, the coinsurance clause specifies the percentage the insured must cover, but I'm getting confused. Let me think again. If the policy has an 80% coinsurance clause, that means the insured must pay 80% of the loss, and the insurance covers 20%. Or is it the other way around? No, I think the coinsurance is the ratio of the insurance coverage to the total value. So, for example, if the policy is 80% coinsurance, the insured must have insurance coverage equal to 80% of the property's value. If they don't, then the insurance might only pay a percentage based on that.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up concepts. Let me clarify: Coinsurance is when the insured is required to have insurance coverage equal to a certain percentage (like 80%) of the property's value. If the actual loss occurs, the insurance will pay the lesser of the policy limit and the coinsurance amount. If the insured doesn't meet the coinsurance, the payout is reduced.

So in this problem, the policy is $20,000, and the house is $30,000. The coinsurance is 80%, so the required insurance would be 80% of $30,000, which is $24,000. But Mr. Fields only has $20,000 in coverage. That means he's underinsured by $4,000. 

Wait, no, the coinsurance is part of the policy. So the policy's coinsurance clause is 80%, meaning the insurance will pay 80% of the loss, but only up to the policy limit. Or is it that the insurance will pay the loss up to the policy limit, provided that the insured has met the coinsurance requirement.

Wait, perhaps the formula is that the insurance will pay the lesser of the policy limit or (coinsurance percentage multiplied by the loss). So, the insurance payout is min(policy limit, coinsurance % * loss).

Alternatively, if the policy has an 80% coinsurance clause, the maximum the insurance will pay is 80% of the loss, but not exceeding the policy limit. Or wait, maybe the coinsurance determines how much the insured has to pay. Let me get this straight.

I think the correct approach is: the insurance company will pay a portion based on the coinsurance clause. The coinsurance ratio is 80%, so the insured must cover 80% of the loss, and the insurance covers 20%. But wait, no, that might not be it. Alternatively, the insurance will pay 80% of the loss, but not more than the policy limit.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled. Let's try another approach. Coinsurance is often a way to ensure that the insured has adequate coverage. The coinsurance clause states that the insured must maintain insurance equal to a certain percentage of the property's value. If the loss occurs, the insurance will pay the lesser of the policy limit or the coinsurance amount. 

So, in this case, the coinsurance is 80% of the $30,000 house, which would be $24,000. But Mr. Fields only has $20,000 in coverage. So when the loss happens, the insurance will calculate the payout based on the coinsurance.

Wait, but the loss is $10,800. So the coinsurance amount is 80% of $10,800, which is $8,640. Is that right? Or is it 80% of the total value? Hmm.

Alternatively, the insurance payout is calculated as (policy limit / coinsurance percentage) * actual loss. So if the coinsurance is 80%, the formula is (policy limit / 0.8) * loss. Wait, that might not be correct either.

Wait, let me think. If the policy has an 80% coinsurance clause, it means that the insured is required to have insurance equal to 80% of the property's value. If the insured doesn't meet this, the insurance will only pay a proportionate amount. 

So, Mr. Fields's policy is $20,000, and the required coinsurance is 80% of $30,000, which is $24,000. Since he only has $20,000, he's underinsured by $4,000. 

When a loss occurs, the insurance will pay according to the coinsurance. The formula for the payout when underinsured is (policy limit / required coinsurance) * loss. So, the payout is (20,000 / 24,000) * 10,800.

Let me compute that: 20,000 divided by 24,000 is 0.8333. Multiply that by 10,800: 0.8333 * 10,800 ≈ 9,000. So the insurance would pay $9,000.

Wait, but another way I've heard is that if the policy is under the coinsurance amount, the insurance pays (policy limit / (coinsurance percentage)) multiplied by the loss. So, (20,000 / 0.8) * 10,800? No, that would be 25,000 * 10,800, which doesn't make sense. Maybe I'm mixing up the formula.

Alternatively, the insurance company will pay the lesser of the policy limit and the coinsurance amount multiplied by the loss. But I'm getting confused.

Wait, let me try another approach. The coinsurance clause is 80%, so the insured is supposed to have insurance equal to 80% of the property's value, which is $24,000. Since Mr. Fields has $20,000, which is less than 80%, he's underinsured. 

In such cases, the insurance will pay only a portion of the loss. The formula is: insurance payout = (policy limit / required coinsurance) * actual loss.

So, policy limit is $20,000, required coinsurance is 80% of $30,000 = $24,000.

So, 20,000 / 24,000 = 5/6 ≈ 0.8333.

Multiply that by the loss of $10,800: 0.8333 * 10,800 ≈ 9,000.

So the insurance would pay $9,000, which is option D.

Alternatively, I've also heard that if the policy is under the required coinsurance, the payout is limited to the policy amount, but only up to 80% of the loss. Wait, that might not be the case. Let me think again.

Another approach: The coinsurance clause is 80%, so the insurance will cover 80% of the loss, but only up to the policy limit. So, 80% of $10,800 is $8,640. But the policy is $20,000, which is more than $8,640, so the insurance would pay $8,640. But that's not one of the options. Wait, no, option J is $8,640. But earlier calculation suggested $9,000.

Hmm, that's conflicting. So which is correct?

I think the correct formula is when the policy is under the required coinsurance, the insurance pays (policy limit / coinsurance) * loss.

So, policy limit is $20,000, coinsurance is 80% of $30,000 = $24,000.

Thus, payout is (20,000 / 24,000) * 10,800 = (5/6)*10,800=9,000.

So the answer is D: $9,000.

Alternatively, if the coinsurance is 80%, meaning the insurance covers 80% of the loss, so 80% of $10,800 is $8,640. But that would be if the policy was sufficient. But since the policy is $20,000, which is more than $8,640, why would it pay only $8,640? That doesn't make sense. Because the policy is for $20k, so paying $8,640 is within the policy limit.

Wait, but the coinsurance is about the proportion. So maybe the correct way is that the insurance will pay 80% of the loss, but not exceeding the policy limit. So 80% of $10,800 is $8,640, which is less than $20k, so they pay $8,640. But that would be option J.

But now I'm confused because two different methods are giving two different answers. Which one is correct?

I think the correct approach is that the coinsurance clause requires the insured to have insurance equal to 80% of the property value. If the insured's policy is less than that, the insurance company will only pay a proportionate share of the loss based on the ratio of the policy to the required coinsurance.

So, policy is $20k, required is $24k.

So, the ratio is 20/24 = 5/6.

So, the insurance pays 5/6 of the loss.

5/6 of 10,800 is 9,000.

Therefore, the correct answer is D: $9,000.

The insurance company will pay $9,000 on the loss.
