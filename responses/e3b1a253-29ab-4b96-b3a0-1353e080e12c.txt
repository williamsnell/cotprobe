Question:

Find the probability of throwing at least one of the following totals on a single throw of a pair of dice: a total of 5, a total of 6, or a total of 7. Define the events A, B, and C as follows: Event A:atotal of 5 is thrown, Event B: a total of 6isthrown, Event C: a total of 7isthrown.

Options:

A: 9 / 12
B: 13 / 36

D: 1 / 12
E: 5 / 12
F: 10 / 36
G: 7 / 12
H: 17 / 36
I: 11 / 36
J: 4 / 36

Okay, so I have this probability question about throwing a pair of dice. The question is asking for the probability of getting at least one of the totals: 5, 6, or 7. The events are defined as A (total of 5), B (total of 6), and C (total of 7). I need to find the probability of A, B, or C happening on a single throw.

First, I remember that when dealing with probabilities of multiple events, especially when they might overlap, I should consider using the principle of inclusion-exclusion. That means the probability of A or B or C is equal to the sum of their individual probabilities minus the probabilities of their overlaps plus the probability that all three happen together.

But wait, in the case of dice, can all three events happen at the same time? No, because each throw results in a single total. So, events A, B, and C are mutually exclusive. That means there's no overlap between them. So the inclusion-exclusion formula simplifies because the intersections (like A and B happening together) can't happen. Therefore, P(A or B or C) = P(A) + P(B) + P(C).

Now, I need to find the number of ways to get each total and then convert those into probabilities.

Let me list the possible outcomes for each total:

- Total of 5: The combinations are (1,4), (2,3), (3,2), (4,1). So that's 4 outcomes.
- Total of 6: The combinations are (1,5), (2,4), (3,3), (4,2), (5,1). That's 5 outcomes.
- Total of 7: The combinations are (1,6), (2,5), (3,4), (4,3), (5,2), (6,1). That's 6 outcomes.

Wait, I should double-check these counts to make sure I'm not missing any or adding extra.

For total 5:
- 1+4=5
- 2+3=5
- 3+2=5
- 4+1=5 → 4 ways.

Total 6:
- 1+5=6
- 2+4=6
- 3+3=6
- 4+2=6
- 5+1=6 → 5 ways.

Total 7:
- 1+6=7
- 2+5=7
- 3+4=7
- 4+3=7
- 5+2=7
- 6+1=7 → 6 ways.

So, the counts are correct.

Since there are 6 sides on each die, the total number of possible outcomes when throwing two dice is 6*6=36.

Now, the number of favorable outcomes for each event:
- P(A) = 4/36
- P(B) =5/36
- P(C) =6/36

Since the events are mutually exclusive, the total probability is 4 +5 +6 =15 favorable outcomes.

So, P(A or B or C) =15/36.

Wait a minute, but looking at the options, I don't see 15/36. Let me check the options again.

Options are A through J, with fractions like 9/12, 13/36, 6/36, etc. Hmm, 15/36 simplifies to 5/12, which is option E.

Wait, but wait—am I certain that the events are mutually exclusive? Because when I'm adding P(A) + P(B) + P(C), I'm assuming they can't happen at the same time. Since each throw can only result in one total, yes, they are mutually exclusive. So adding them is correct.

Alternatively, I could calculate the probability of not getting any of these totals and subtract that from 1. Let's try that method to confirm.

First, what are the possible totals when rolling two dice? They can be from 2 to 12. So, the totals we're not interested in are 2,3,4,8,9,10,11,12.

Now, how many outcomes result in each of these totals:

- Total 2: 1 way (1+1)
- Total 3: 2 ways (1+2, 2+1)
- Total 4: 3 ways (1+3, 2+2, 3+1)
- Total 8: 5 ways (2+6, 3+5, 4+4, 5+3, 6+2)
- Total 9: 4 ways (3+6,4+5,5+4,6+3)
- Total 10: 3 ways (4+6,5+5,6+4)
- Total 11: 2 ways (5+6,6+5)
- Total 12: 1 way (6+6)

Adding these up:

Total 2:1
3:2 → total so far 3
4:3 → total 6
8:5 → 11
9:4 →15
10:3 →18
11:2 →20
12:1 →21.

So, 21 outcomes are not 5,6,7. Therefore, the number of outcomes that are 5,6,7 is 36 -21 =15, which matches the earlier count.

Thus, the probability is 15/36 =5/12, which is option E.

Looking at the options:

E:5/12

The probability of throwing a total of 5, 6, or 7 on a pair of dice is 5/12.
