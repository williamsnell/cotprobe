Alright, so I've got this question about a passage from President Harry S. Truman in 1947, and I need to figure out what policy or event it supports. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the passage says that totalitarian regimes grow in the soil of poverty and strife, and when people lose hope for a better life, those regimes reach their full growth. Truman emphasizes keeping that hope alive and talks about great responsibilities placed on them by swift events. He ends with confidence that Congress will face these responsibilities squarely.

I remember that Truman's 1947 speech is often associated with the policy of containment. Containment was the idea of stopping the spread of communism, which was the main foreign policy of the United States during the Cold War. The speech where he talked about this was the "Truman Doctrine," which provided aid to Greece and Turkey to prevent them from falling under Soviet influence.

Looking at the options, A is the policy of containment. The passage talks about preventing the spread of totalitarianism by addressing the root causes—misery, want, poverty, and strife. By helping countries avoid these conditions, the U.S. aimed to stop the rise of communist regimes. So the rationale here aligns with containment.

Option B is the start of the Cold War. While the speech is from the early Cold War period, the question asks for the rationale provided by the passage. The Cold War was more about the ideological conflict between the US and the USSR, not specifically about containment.

Option C is the UN. The UN was established earlier, in 1945, so this speech doesn't directly establish it. Plus, the focus here is more on the U.S. taking action rather than international cooperation through the UN.

Option D is the Atlantic Charter, which was a policy from World War II, 1941, so it's not related to this 1947 speech.

Option E is NATO, which was established in 1949, a couple of years after this speech. While related to containment, the speech itself is more about the doctrine than the military alliance.

Option F is roll-back, which is a more aggressive policy than containment. Roll-back would be actively reversing communist gains, whereas Truman's approach was to contain it.

Option G is massive retaliation, which I think is related to the doctrine of deterrence in the 1950s, maybe under Eisenhower, not directly tied to this speech.

Option H is détente, which is a relaxation of Cold War tensions, occurring later in the 1970s. So that's not relevant here.

So the main idea in the passage is about preventing the spread of totalitarianism by addressing the conditions that allow it to grow. That's exactly what containment aimed to do. Therefore, the answer should be A.

The passage emphasizes the need to prevent the spread of totalitarian regimes by addressing the conditions of poverty, strife, and lost hope that allow them to grow. This aligns with the policy of containment, which sought to stop the spread of communism. 

Answer: A
