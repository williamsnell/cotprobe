Question:

In building a linear regression model for a particular data set, you observe the coefficient of one of the features having a relatively high negative value. This suggests that

Options:

A: The model will perform better without this feature
B: This feature does not have a strong effect on the model (should be ignored)
C: It is not possible to comment on the importance of this feature without additional information
D: This feature has a strong effect on the model (should be retained)
E: This feature negatively impacts the model (should be removed)
F: The model is overfitting due to this feature
G: This feature has a weak negative correlation with the target variable
H: The negative coefficient value is a sign of data leakage
I: Nothing can be determined.
J: This feature has a strong positive correlation with the target variable

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this linear regression question. The question is about interpreting a coefficient in a linear regression model. Let me think through this step by step.

So, the scenario is that when building a linear regression model, one of the features has a relatively high negative coefficient. The question is asking what this suggests about the feature.

First, I remember that in linear regression, the coefficients represent the relationship between each feature (independent variable) and the target (dependent variable). A positive coefficient means that as the feature increases, the target tends to increase as well. Conversely, a negative coefficient means that as the feature increases, the target tends to decrease.

So, a high negative coefficient suggests a strong inverse relationship. That is, the feature is negatively associated with the target variable. This implies that the feature has a significant effect on the model because a large magnitude (whether positive or negative) indicates a strong correlation.

Now, looking at the options:

A: The model will perform better without this feature. Well, having a high negative coefficient doesn't necessarily mean the feature is bad. It just shows a strong negative relationship. Removing it might actually reduce the model's performance if the feature is important.

B: This feature does not have a strong effect on the model. No, because a high magnitude coefficient suggests a strong effect, regardless of the sign.

C: It is not possible to comment without additional info. Hmm, I think we can comment based on the coefficient's magnitude and sign. So probably not this one.

D: This feature has a strong effect on the model (should be retained). Yes, because the coefficient's magnitude is high, indicating it's important. So retaining it would be good.

E: This feature negatively impacts the model (should be removed). Wait, the impact isn't necessarily negative in terms of model performance. It just has a negative correlation. The model might still benefit from including it if it's a true relationship.

F: The model is overfitting due to this feature. Overfitting is more about the model fitting the training data too closely, not directly about the coefficient's sign or magnitude. So probably not F.

G: This feature has a weak negative correlation with the target variable. No, because the coefficient is high, which suggests a strong correlation, not weak.

H: Negative coefficient is a sign of data leakage. Data leakage usually refers to using data that's not available at the time of prediction. I don't think the coefficient's sign indicates that. So H is probably incorrect.

I: Nothing can be determined. No, because a high negative coefficient does provide information about the feature's relationship with the target.

J: This feature has a strong positive correlation with the target variable. No, because the coefficient is negative, so it's a strong negative, not positive.

So, putting it all together, the correct answer should be D: This feature has a strong effect on the model (should be retained).

The high negative coefficient indicates a strong inverse relationship between the feature and the target variable, suggesting the feature is important and should be retained.

Answer: D
