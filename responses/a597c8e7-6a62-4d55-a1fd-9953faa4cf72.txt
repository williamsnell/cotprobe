Okay, I need to figure out the correct answer to this multiple-choice question about assessing an internal auditor's objectivity when an independent auditor is involved. Let's go through each option one by one and think about what each one means.

The question is asking what an independent auditor should do to assess the objectivity of an internal auditor. Objectivity is crucial because it ensures that the internal auditor isn't biased or influenced, allowing them to perform their duties impartially.

Option A: Perform tests of controls to determine whether significant internal control activities are properly maintained. Hmm, tests of controls are usually about evaluating the effectiveness of internal controls, not necessarily the auditor's objectivity. So maybe A isn't the right choice.

Option B: Review the internal auditor's educational background and certifications. While education and certifications are important for competence, they don't directly assess objectivity. It's more about capability than impartiality. So B might not be the answer.

Option C: Evaluate the internal auditor's personal financial statements. This seems more about detecting potential conflicts of interest through personal finances. If the internal auditor has financial interests that could bias them, this could affect objectivity. So C is a possibility.

Option D: Consider the internal auditor's relationship with external regulatory bodies. Relationships with regulators might affect how the auditor interacts with them, but I'm not sure how directly this relates to the auditor's objectivity towards the organization they're auditing. Maybe not the best option.

Option E: Review the internal auditor's reports to verify that the conclusions reached are consistent with the procedures performed. This sounds like it's about the quality of the audit work, ensuring that the reports are accurate and conclusions are justified. It checks for competence and thoroughness but might also touch on objectivity if the conclusions are unbiased. So E is a contender.

Option F: Analyze the risk factors that relate to misstatements arising from the misappropriation of assets. This seems more about assessing the risk of fraud within the company, not the auditor's objectivity. So F is probably not the right choice.

Option G: Assess the frequency and severity of past audit findings. This could indicate whether the internal auditor has been thorough in their past work. If they consistently find issues, it might suggest effective auditing, but does it directly assess objectivity? Maybe, but I'm not sure if it's the best option.

Option H: Consider the policies that prohibit the internal auditor from auditing areas where relatives are employed in key management positions. This relates to conflict of interest. If the internal auditor has relatives in key positions, they might be biased, so policies to prevent auditing those areas would maintain objectivity. So H is a strong candidate.

Now, thinking about what objectivity means. An auditor should be impartial and free from bias. So the independent auditor needs to ensure that the internal auditor doesn't have any personal interests or relationships that could compromise their objectivity.

Option H is about policies that prevent auditing certain areas if relatives are in key positions, which directly addresses potential conflicts of interest. That seems like a solid way to assess objectivity because it's about avoiding situations where bias could occur.

Option E, on the other hand, is more about the technical quality of the audit reports, ensuring that the work is done correctly, which is important but maybe not the primary factor in assessing objectivity.

So between H and E, I think H is more directly about objectivity. Therefore, the correct answer should be H.

The correct answer is H. Assessing the internal auditor's objectivity involves ensuring they are free from conflicts of interest. Reviewing policies that prevent auditing areas where relatives hold key positions directly addresses potential biases, making H the appropriate choice.

Answer: H
