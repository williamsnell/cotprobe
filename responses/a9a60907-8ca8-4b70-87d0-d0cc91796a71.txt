Okay, so I have this question about the Whorfian hypothesis of linguistic relativity. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my linguistics, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that the Whorfian hypothesis is related to the idea that language influences thought. So, it's about how the structure and vocabulary of a language shape the way people perceive the world. That's the gist of linguistic relativity, right? So the question is asking why the Whorfian hypothesis helps explain something.

Looking at the options:

A: Some languages are tonal while others are not. I'm not sure how this ties directly to the hypothesis. Tonal languages use pitch to differentiate meaning, but I don't recall Whorf focusing on that specifically.

B: Humans can create new words. That sounds more like the flexibility of language and creativity, which might not be directly explained by linguistic relativity. It's more about the structure than the creation of words.

C: Phonemes not interchangeable with morphemes. Phonemes are sounds, morphemes are meaning units. I think this is more about the basics of linguistics rather than how language affects thought.

D: People can understand multiple languages. That's about multilingualism, which I don't think is the main point of the Whorfian hypothesis. It's more about how your native language affects your thinking.

E: Cultures have developed different languages. That seems a bit broad. The development of different languages is more of an evolutionary or sociocultural question, not directly about how language affects thought.

F: Eskimos have many words for snow. Oh, this rings a bell. The idea is that if a language has many terms for something, the culture might think about it differently. Like the Eskimo having multiple words for snow because their environment requires it. That's a classic example used to explain linguistic relativity.

G: Parents use a high-pitched voice with infants. That seems more related to child development and communication styles rather than linguistic relativity.

H: English is a universal language. That's more about language spread and dominance, not how language structures thought.

So, the Whorfian hypothesis explains that language affects thought, so if a language has many terms for snow, speakers might perceive snow in more nuanced ways. The example with Eskimos and snow is often cited to illustrate this point. Therefore, the answer should be F.

The Whorfian hypothesis suggests that language influences thought, particularly through the structure and vocabulary of a language. This is best illustrated by the example of Eskimos having many words for snow, which implies that their language shapes their perception of snow in a more detailed way. 

Answer: F
