<think>
Okay, so I've got this problem about calculating the rated-load efficiency of a compound generator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

First, let me read the question again. It's a 100-kW, 250-V six-pole, 900-rpm compound generator with a long-shunt connection. The data given includes no-load rotational losses of 3840 W, armature resistance at 75°C as 0.012 ohms, series-field resistance as 0.004 ohms, commutating-pole field resistance also 0.004 ohms, and shunt-field current at 2.60 A. The stray-load loss is 1% of the output. I need to find the rated-load efficiency.

Alright, so rated-load efficiency is the output power divided by the input power. Wait, no, efficiency is usually output divided by input. But I think in generator terms, it's the power delivered to the load over the total input power, which includes losses.

But let's think about the components of the losses. At rated load, the total losses include rotational losses (which are given as 3840 W on no load, but wait, no—rotational losses might vary with load, but wait, no, in some cases, rotational losses are considered constant. Hmm, I'm not sure. Or do they include other losses like iron losses, which might vary with current. Hmm.

Wait, the problem says "no-load rotational losses" are 3840 W. So that's the losses when there's no load, right? So under load, rotational losses might increase because the current is higher, leading to more I²R losses in the armature and other windings.

Wait, but the question states to assume a stray-load loss equal to 1% of the output. Stray-load loss usually refers to the losses in the armature and other parts due to the load current, like the I²R losses in the armature, series field, commutating poles, etc. So perhaps the total losses at rated load are the sum of rotational losses plus the stray-load losses plus the copper losses in the shunt field and series field and commutating poles.

Wait, no. Let me clarify. The generator's total losses at full load would include:

1. Rotational losses (mechanical losses, like friction and windage) — but wait, the given rotational losses are 3840 W on no load. However, under load, does this value change? I think rotational losses are usually considered constant because they depend on speed and not on the current. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, sometimes rotational losses are considered to be part of the core losses, which are constant.

Wait, but the problem says "no-load rotational losses" are 3840 W. So perhaps these are the losses when there's no electrical load, just the mechanical losses. So under load, the electrical losses (I²R) would be additional. So total losses would be 3840 W plus the I²R losses.

But then the problem also mentions a stray-load loss equal to 1% of the output. Stray-load loss is typically the sum of the I²R losses in the armature, series field, and commutating poles. So perhaps I should calculate that.

Wait, let's break it down.

First, let's note the given data:

- Output power (P_output) = 100 kW = 100,000 W.
- Voltage (V) = 250 V.
- Shunt-field current (I_sh) = 2.60 A.
- Armature resistance (R_a) = 0.012 ohms.
- Series-field resistance (R_s) = 0.004 ohms.
- Commutating-pole resistance (R_c) = 0.004 ohms.
- Stray-load loss (P_stray) = 1% of output = 0.01 * 100,000 = 1,000 W.
- Rotational losses (P_rot) = 3840 W on no load. But wait, does this include or exclude electrical losses? Hmm. Wait, no, because on no load, the only losses are mechanical, like friction and windage, so P_rot is 3840 W.

So, the total losses at rated load would be:

P_total_losses = P_rot + P_stray + (I²R for all the windings except shunt, maybe? Or is P_stray already including those?)

Wait, perhaps the stray-load loss includes the I²R losses in the armature, series, and commutating fields. So the 1% is 1,000 W, which is the total of those I²R losses. So then, the total losses at rated load would be 3840 W (rotational) plus 1,000 W (stray) plus any other losses, like the shunt field's copper loss.

Wait, the shunt field's current is given as 2.60 A, so its copper loss would be I_sh² * R_sh. R_sh is the shunt field resistance. Wait, but the problem doesn't give R_sh directly. Hmm, wait, the shunt field is part of the long-shunt connection, so R_sh would be in parallel with the armature circuit. Wait no, in a long-shunt compound generator, the shunt field is connected in parallel with the armature, so the shunt field current is determined by the voltage divided by its resistance. But in this case, I_sh is given as 2.60 A, so we can find R_sh from that.

Wait, but wait. The shunt field current is I_sh = 2.60 A. The shunt field is connected across the generator's terminal voltage, which is 250 V. So the resistance of the shunt field (R_sh) is V / I_sh = 250 V / 2.60 A ≈ 96.15 ohms. But wait, that's a very high resistance, which seems odd because the series and commutating resistances are given as 0.004 ohms each. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake here.

Wait, no. Wait, the shunt field is connected in parallel with the armature, so its voltage is the same as the terminal voltage, which is 250 V. Therefore, the shunt field current is I_sh = V / R_sh. But in this case, I_sh is given as 2.60 A, so R_sh = V / I_sh = 250 / 2.6 ≈ 96.15 ohms. But that seems very high. Wait, maybe I'm confusing shunt and series fields. Alternatively, perhaps the shunt field resistance is part of the generator's excitation, so perhaps it's different.

Wait, but the problem gives R_s (series field) as 0.004 ohms and R_c (commutating) as 0.004 ohms. So perhaps the shunt field's resistance is R_sh, which we can calculate as V / I_sh = 250 V / 2.6 A ≈ 96.15 ohms. So the copper loss in the shunt field is I_sh² * R_sh = (2.6)^2 * 96.15 ≈ 6.76 * 96.15 ≈ 651.2 W. But wait, that seems high. Alternatively, perhaps the shunt field resistance is different because it's part of the generator's construction, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating it.

Wait, but let's think again. The problem states that the generator is a long-shunt compound generator. In such a configuration, the shunt field is connected in parallel with the armature. So the shunt field current is determined by the voltage and its resistance.

Given that, the shunt field current is I_sh = 2.60 A, so R_sh = V / I_sh = 250 / 2.6 ≈ 96.15 ohms. So the copper loss in the shunt field is I_sh² * R_sh = (2.6)^2 * 96.15 ≈ 6.76 * 96.15 ≈ 651 W.

But wait, the problem says to assume a stray-load loss of 1% of the output, which is 1,000 W. Stray-load loss typically refers to the losses in the armature, series field, and commutating poles due to the load current. So that would be I²R for the armature, series, and commutating poles. So perhaps the 1,000 W includes those I²R losses, so the shunt field's copper loss is separate and needs to be added.

So the total losses at rated load would be:

- Rotational losses (P_rot) = 3840 W.
- Stray-load losses (P_stray) = 1,000 W.
- Shunt field copper loss (P_sh) = I_sh² * R_sh = 2.6² * (250/2.6) = 2.6^2 * (96.15) ≈ 6.76 * 96.15 ≈ 651 W.

Wait, that can't be right because 651 W is already a significant loss. Adding that to 3840 and 1000 would give a total loss of 3840 + 1000 + 651 ≈ 5491 W. But the output is 100,000 W, so efficiency would be (100,000) / (100,000 + 5491) ≈ 100,000 / 105,491 ≈ 0.948, which is about 94.8%, which isn't one of the options. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the stray-load loss already includes all the I²R losses except the shunt field. Because in the problem statement, it says "stray-load loss equal to 1% of the output". So perhaps the 1% is calculated as 1% of the output power, which is 1,000 W. So that 1,000 W would include the I²R losses in the armature, series field, and commutating poles, but not the shunt field because the shunt field is in parallel and its loss is calculated separately.

Wait, but the shunt field's current is 2.6 A, and its resistance is about 96 ohms, so the loss is about 651 W, as before. So the total losses would be 3840 (rotational) + 1,000 (stray) + 651 (shunt) ≈ 5491 W. But that would make the efficiency 100,000 / (100,000 + 5491) ≈ 94.8%, which isn't an option. The options are all lower than that.

Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the calculation of the shunt field loss. Let me think again. The shunt field is connected in parallel with the armature, so its voltage is the terminal voltage, which is 250 V. The current through the shunt field is I_sh = 2.6 A, so the resistance R_sh is 250 / 2.6 ≈ 96.15 ohms. So the copper loss is I²R = (2.6)^2 * 96.15 ≈ 6.76 * 96.15 ≈ 651 W. That seems correct.

Wait, but perhaps the shunt field's copper loss is included in the stray-load loss. Because sometimes, stray-load loss includes all the I²R losses except the armature. Wait no, the armature is part of the stray load. Hmm, I'm getting confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps the stray-load loss is only the I²R in the armature, series, and commutating poles. So if that's 1% of the output, which is 1,000 W, then the shunt field's copper loss is separate.

Wait, but let's think about the formula for efficiency. Efficiency η = (Output Power) / (Input Power). Input Power is the sum of Output Power and all the losses.

So, Input Power = Output Power + P_rot + P_stray + P_sh.

So, Input Power = 100,000 + 3840 + 1,000 + 651 ≈ 104,491 W.

Efficiency η = 100,000 / 104,491 ≈ 0.956 or 95.6%, which isn't one of the options. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the shunt field's copper loss isn't part of the input power because the shunt field is excited by the generator's own voltage, so the input power is the mechanical power from the prime mover, which includes the electrical losses except the shunt field's copper loss. Hmm, that doesn't make sense because the shunt field is part of the generator and its losses should be included.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the shunt field's copper loss is included in the stray-load loss. But that doesn't seem right because the stray-load loss is typically the losses in the armature and other series-connected windings.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's try a different approach. The problem says to assume the stray-load loss is 1% of the output, which is 1,000 W. So that covers the I²R losses in the armature, series field, and commutating poles. The shunt field's copper loss is separate and calculated as I_sh² * R_sh. So let's calculate that.

Given I_sh = 2.6 A, and R_sh is the shunt field resistance. Wait, but we can calculate R_sh from the shunt field current and the terminal voltage. Since in a long-shunt connection, the shunt field is across the terminal voltage, so V = I_sh * R_sh → R_sh = V / I_sh = 250 V / 2.6 A ≈ 96.15 ohms. So the copper loss is I²R = (2.6)^2 * 96.15 ≈ 6.76 * 96.15 ≈ 651 W.

So total losses are:

- Rotational losses: 3840 W (constant)
- Stray-load loss: 1,000 W
- Shunt field copper loss: 651 W

Total losses = 3840 + 1000 + 651 = 5491 W.

Input power = Output + losses = 100,000 + 5491 = 105,491 W.

Efficiency = 100,000 / 105,491 ≈ 0.948 or 94.8%. But looking at the options, the closest is J: 0.950, but that's not exact. Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps the stray-load loss already includes the shunt field's copper loss. Let me check that. Stray-load loss is usually the sum of the I²R losses in the armature, series field, and commutating poles. The shunt field is in parallel, so its loss is separate. So perhaps the 1,000 W is only for the armature, series, and commutating fields. So the shunt field loss is separate.

Alternatively, perhaps the shunt field's copper loss is negligible because its resistance is high, so the current is low. Wait, no, 2.6 A through 96 ohms is a significant loss of about 650 W.

Hmm, perhaps the problem assumes that the shunt field's copper loss is included in the rotational losses, but that doesn't make sense because rotational losses are mechanical, not electrical.

Wait, maybe the no-load rotational losses already include the shunt field's copper loss when the generator is on no load. But when the generator is under load, the shunt field's current increases, leading to higher copper losses. Wait, but the shunt field current is fixed by the voltage and resistance, so under load, the voltage is fixed, so I_sh remains the same. Therefore, the shunt field's copper loss is constant, 651 W.

So the total losses at rated load are:

- Rotational: 3840 W
- Stray-load: 1,000 W
- Shunt field: 651 W

Total: 3840 + 1000 + 651 = 5491 W.

Input power = 100,000 + 5491 = 105,491 W.

Efficiency = 100,000 / 105,491 ≈ 0.948 or 94.8%, which isn't an option. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in including the shunt field's copper loss. Maybe the problem doesn't consider it because it's part of the excitation and not part of the generator's losses when calculating efficiency. Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the shunt field's copper loss is included in the rotational losses, but that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps the shunt field's copper loss is not part of the electrical losses but is part of the excitation system, so it's not included in the generator's efficiency calculation. That would mean the total losses are only 3840 + 1000 = 4840 W.

So Input Power = 100,000 + 4840 = 104,840 W.

Efficiency = 100,000 / 104,840 ≈ 0.9536 or 95.36%, which is still not matching any options.

Hmm, perhaps the approach is wrong. Let's try another method. Maybe the total losses are just the rotational losses plus the stray-load loss, and the shunt field's copper loss is included in the stray-load loss. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the shunt field's copper loss is already included in the rotational losses when the generator is on no load, but that doesn't make sense because rotational losses are mechanical.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the shunt field's current is 2.6 A, but the actual copper loss is I_sh² * R_sh, where R_sh is the shunt field resistance. But wait, the shunt field resistance at 75°C is not given. Wait, the problem gives armature resistance at 75°C as 0.012 ohms, series field as 0.004, and commutating as 0.004. But it doesn't give the shunt field resistance at 75°C. Hmm, but earlier I calculated R_sh as 250 / 2.6 ≈ 96.15 ohms, but that's at the operating voltage, not necessarily at 75°C. But the problem says all resistances are at 75°C, so perhaps I should use R_sh as given or calculate it differently.

Wait, perhaps the shunt field's resistance is not given because it's not needed for this calculation, and the copper loss is negligible. Alternatively, perhaps the shunt field's copper loss is included in the stray-load loss or rotational loss.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the shunt field's copper loss is included in the rotational losses, so we don't need to add it separately. That would mean the total losses are 3840 + 1000 = 4840 W.

Efficiency would then be 100,000 / (100,000 + 4840) ≈ 100,000 / 104,840 ≈ 0.9536, which is still not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the rotational losses. The problem states "no-load rotational losses = 3840 W." So when the generator is on no load, the only losses are the rotational losses, which are 3840 W. Under load, the generator's losses include the rotational losses plus the electrical losses (stray-load loss and shunt field copper loss). So the total losses at rated load would be 3840 + 1000 + 651 = 5491 W.

But that leads to 94.8% efficiency, which isn't an option. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the shunt field's copper loss is not part of the input power because the shunt field is excited by the generator's own voltage, so its power comes from the generator's output. But that can't be right because the shunt field's power is part of the generator's losses. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the shunt field's copper loss is included in the stray-load loss, meaning the 1% already includes all the I²R losses, including the shunt field. But that doesn't make sense because the shunt field is in parallel, so its current is determined by the voltage and resistance, not the load current.

Wait, perhaps the shunt field's copper loss is part of the stray-load loss. Let me check that.

Stray-load loss is defined as the losses in the armature, series field, and commutating poles due to the load current. The shunt field is not part of the stray load because it's connected in parallel. So the shunt field's copper loss is separate and must be calculated.

But then, as before, the total losses would be 3840 + 1000 + 651 = 5491 W, leading to 94.8% efficiency, which isn't an option.

Hmm, perhaps the problem assumes that the shunt field's copper loss is included in the rotational losses. So, the rotational losses include the mechanical losses plus the shunt field's copper loss. But that doesn't make sense because rotational losses are purely mechanical.

Wait, maybe the shunt field's copper loss is part of the stray-load loss, making the 1,000 W include all I²R losses, including shunt. But that would require that I_sh is part of the load current, which it's not. The shunt field is excited by the generator's voltage, so its current is determined by V and R_sh, not by the load.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed in such a way that we don't need to consider the shunt field's copper loss when calculating efficiency. Maybe it's considered part of the excitation system and not part of the generator's losses. That would mean the total losses are 3840 + 1000 = 4840 W, giving efficiency as 100,000 / (100,000 + 4840) ≈ 95.36%, which still isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in calculating the shunt field's copper loss. Let me double-check. I_sh is 2.6 A, and R_sh is V / I_sh = 250 / 2.6 ≈ 96.15 ohms. So copper loss is I²R = (2.6)^2 * 96.15 ≈ 6.76 * 96.15 ≈ 651 W. That seems correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the shunt field's copper loss is not part of the input power. Because the shunt field is excited by the generator's own voltage, the power for the shunt field comes from the generator's output, not from the prime mover. So when calculating the efficiency, which is Output Power / (Prime Mover Input Power), the shunt field's copper loss is part of the Output Power, not part of the Input Power. Wait, that can't be right because the shunt field's power is part of the generator's internal losses, so it should be subtracted from the Output Power.

Wait, no, the Output Power is the power delivered to the load, not the generator's internal power. So the shunt field's copper loss is an internal loss and should be subtracted from the Output Power to get the Input Power. So the Input Power is Output Power + all losses, including shunt field.

But that brings us back to the earlier problem where the efficiency is too high.

Alternatively, perhaps the shunt field's copper loss is part of the generator's excitation and is not considered part of the generator's losses for efficiency calculation. That would be unusual, but perhaps that's the case.

In that scenario, the total losses are 3840 (rotational) + 1000 (stray) = 4840 W.

So Input Power = 100,000 + 4840 = 104,840 W.

Efficiency = 100,000 / 104,840 ≈ 0.9536 or 95.36%, still not matching any options.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is that the stray-load loss includes the shunt field's copper loss. Let me check that.

If the stray-load loss of 1% includes the shunt field's copper loss, then the total losses are 3840 + 1000 = 4840 W.

But then, the shunt field's copper loss would be included in the 1000 W, which would mean that the 1000 W already includes all I²R losses, including shunt. But that would require that I_sh is part of the load current, which it's not. So that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the shunt field's copper loss is part of the rotational losses. But that would mean the rotational losses are higher than stated, which contradicts the problem statement.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed such that the shunt field's copper loss is not considered, and the total losses are only 3840 + 1000 = 4840 W, leading to efficiency of about 95.36%, which isn't an option. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, perhaps the stray-load loss is calculated differently. Stray-load loss is usually given by P_stray = (I² * R) for the armature, series, and commutating fields. So perhaps we can calculate it without assuming it's 1% of the output.

Wait, the problem says to assume a stray-load loss equal to 1% of the output. So perhaps the 1% is given, so we don't need to calculate it. So the stray-load loss is 1,000 W.

So, perhaps the total losses are:

- Rotational: 3840 W
- Stray: 1,000 W
- Shunt field copper loss: 651 W

Total: 3840 + 1000 + 651 = 5491 W.

Efficiency = 100,000 / (100,000 + 5491) ≈ 94.8%.

But the options don't have this. The closest is J: 0.950, but it's 95%, which is close but not exact. Alternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake in including the shunt field's copper loss.

Wait, perhaps the shunt field's copper loss is not part of the input power because it's part of the generator's excitation and is not a loss from the prime mover's perspective. So the prime mover's input power doesn't include the shunt field's copper loss because that power comes from the generator's own output. So the total losses would be 3840 + 1000 = 4840 W.

So Input Power = 100,000 + 4840 = 104,840 W.

Efficiency = 100,000 / 104,840 ≈ 0.9536 or 95.36%, which is still not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the shunt field's copper loss is included in the rotational losses. That would mean the rotational losses are 3840 W plus the shunt field's copper loss of 651 W, totaling 4491 W. Then, the total losses would be 4491 + 1000 = 5491 W, leading to the same 94.8% efficiency.

Hmm, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the shunt field's copper loss. Let's see what happens if we do that.

Total losses = 3840 (rotational) + 1000 (stray) = 4840 W.

Efficiency = 100,000 / (100,000 + 4840) ≈ 95.36%, which still isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's look at the options again. The highest option is J: 0.950, which is 95%. My calculation without considering the shunt field's copper loss gives 95.36%, which is close. But the options don't include that. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to not include the shunt field's copper loss in the efficiency calculation, which would give 95.36% efficiency, but that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to not include the shunt field's copper loss, so the total losses are 3840 + 1000 = 4840 W. So Input Power = 100,000 + 4840 = 104,840 W. Efficiency = 100,000 / 104,840 ≈ 0.9536 or 95.36%, which rounds to 95.4%, still not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the shunt field's resistance. Let me recheck that. The shunt field current is 2.6 A, and the generator's terminal voltage is 250 V, so R_sh = V / I_sh = 250 / 2.6 ≈ 96.15 ohms. So the copper loss is I²R = (2.6)^2 * 96.15 ≈ 6.76 * 96.15 ≈ 651 W. That seems correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the shunt field's resistance is not 96 ohms but something else. Wait, the problem gives the shunt field current as 2.60 A, but perhaps that's under a different condition. Wait, no, in a long-shunt connection, the shunt field current is determined by the terminal voltage and its resistance. So if the terminal voltage is 250 V, then R_sh = 250 / 2.6 ≈ 96.15 ohms.

Hmm, perhaps the problem expects us to not include the shunt field's copper loss, leading to an efficiency of about 95%, but the closest option is J: 0.950. However, that's not matching exactly.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating and the correct approach is to consider that the total losses are rotational + stray, and the shunt field's copper loss is included in the stray-load loss. But that doesn't make sense because the shunt field is in parallel.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the shunt field's copper loss is part of the rotational losses. Let me think: no, rotational losses are purely mechanical. So that's not it.

Another approach: perhaps the rated-load efficiency formula is η = (P_output) / (P_output + P_rot + P_stray + P_sh). So that would be 100,000 / (100,000 + 3840 + 1000 + 651) = 100,000 / 105,491 ≈ 0.948 or 94.8%, which isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the shunt field's copper loss, leading to η = 100,000 / (100,000 + 3840 + 1000) = 100,000 / 104,840 ≈ 0.9536 or 95.36%, which rounds to 95.4%, but the options don't have that.

Given that none of the options match my calculations, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me try a different approach: perhaps the shunt field's copper loss is included in the rotational losses, so P_rot is 3840 W plus the shunt field's copper loss of 651 W, totaling 4491 W. Then, total losses are 4491 + 1000 = 5491 W. Efficiency = 100,000 / (100,000 + 5491) ≈ 94.8%, which again isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects us to calculate the armature current and then compute the I²R losses for the armature, series, and commutating fields, and then add the shunt field's copper loss.

Wait, let's calculate the armature current. The generator is 250 V and 100 kW, so the current I_a is P / V = 100,000 / 250 = 400 A.

So the armature current is 400 A. The armature resistance is 0.012 ohms, so the armature copper loss is I_a² * R_a = (400)^2 * 0.012 = 160,000 * 0.012 = 1,920 W.

The series field resistance is 0.004 ohms, and the series field current is the same as the armature current in a compound generator, right? Wait, no. In a compound generator, the series field current is the same as the armature current, I_s = I_a = 400 A. So series copper loss is I_s² * R_s = (400)^2 * 0.004 = 160,000 * 0.004 = 640 W.

Similarly, the commutating pole resistance is 0.004 ohms, and the commutating current is also I_a, so commutating copper loss is I_c² * R_c = 400^2 * 0.004 = 640 W.

So the total I²R losses (stray-load loss) would be 1,920 (armature) + 640 (series) + 640 (commutating) = 3,200 W. But the problem says to assume a stray-load loss of 1% of the output, which is 1,000 W. That's a contradiction because according to this calculation, the stray-load loss is 3,200 W, not 1,000 W.

Hmm, that suggests that my approach is wrong. Perhaps the problem is using a different method or the given data is intended to be used differently.

Wait, perhaps the generator is a long-shunt compound generator, so the shunt field is in parallel with the armature. Therefore, the shunt field current is determined by the voltage and its resistance, while the series and commutating fields are in series with the armature.

Given that, the armature current I_a is 400 A, as calculated before.

The series field current is the same as the armature current, I_s = 400 A. So series copper loss is I_s² * R_s = 400^2 * 0.004 = 640 W.

The commutating pole current is also 400 A, so its copper loss is I_c² * R_c = 400^2 * 0.004 = 640 W.

The armature copper loss is I_a² * R_a = 400^2 * 0.012 = 1,920 W.

So total I²R losses are 1,920 + 640 + 640 = 3,200 W. But the problem says to assume a stray-load loss of 1% of the output, which is 1,000 W. That's a problem because the actual calculation gives 3,200 W, which is 3.2% of the output, not 1%.

This suggests that either the problem has conflicting data or I'm misunderstanding something. Alternatively, perhaps the given shunt field current is under rated load, so the shunt field's copper loss is included in the 1% stray-load loss.

Wait, the problem gives the shunt-field current as 2.60 A, which would be the current when the generator is on no load, because on load, the shunt field current would depend on the voltage and resistance, which would be the same as no load. So perhaps the shunt field's copper loss is 2.6^2 * R_sh, which we calculated as 651 W, but that's under no load. Under load, the shunt field current remains the same because it's in parallel, so its copper loss remains 651 W.

But then, the total I²R losses under load would be armature (1,920) + series (640) + commutating (640) = 3,200 W, plus shunt field (651) = 3,851 W. But the problem says to assume stray-load loss is 1% (1,000 W), which doesn't align with this.

This is confusing. Perhaps the problem is expecting us to ignore the I²R losses and only consider the given rotational losses and the 1% stray-load loss, not calculating them based on resistances.

If that's the case, the total losses would be 3840 (rotational) + 1,000 (stray) = 4840 W.

Efficiency = 100,000 / (100,000 + 4840) ≈ 95.36%, which again isn't an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to not include the shunt field's copper loss because it's part of the excitation and not part of the generator's losses. So total losses are 3840 + 1000 = 4840 W.

Efficiency = 100,000 / (100,000 + 4840) ≈ 0.9536 or 95.36%.

But the options don't have that. The closest is J: 0.950, which is 95%.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects us to not include the shunt field's copper loss and to consider the stray-load loss as given. So the total losses are 3840 + 1000 = 4840 W.

Efficiency = 100,000 / (100,000 + 4840) ≈ 0.9536, which rounds to 95.4%, but the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the armature current. Let me check that again. The generator's output is 100 kW at 250 V, so I = P / V = 100,000 / 250 = 400 A. That seems correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects us to not include the shunt field's copper loss and to calculate the stray-load loss as 1% of the output, which is 1,000 W, and the rotational losses are 3840 W. So total losses are 3840 + 1000 = 4840 W.

Efficiency = 100,000 / (100,000 + 4840) ≈ 0.9536 or 95.36%, which isn't an option. Therefore, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects us to not include the shunt field's copper loss because it's negligible. So the total losses are 3840 + 1000 = 4840 W.

Efficiency = 100,000 / (100,000 + 4840) ≈ 95.36%, which is approximately 95.4%. The closest option is J: 0.950, but that's 95%, which is slightly lower.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to not include the shunt field's copper loss and to consider the stray-load loss as given, leading to an efficiency of approximately 95%, which is option J.

But I'm not confident because my calculations suggest a higher efficiency. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to calculate the shunt field's copper loss based on the given I_sh of 2.6 A and R_sh of 96 ohms, leading to 651 W, and include that in the losses, making the efficiency about 94.8%, which isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula for efficiency as:

η = (P_output) / (P_output + P_rot + P_stray)

So P_rot is 3840, P_stray is 1000.

Total losses = 3840 + 1000 = 4840.

Thus, Input Power = 100,000 + 4840 = 104,840 W.

Efficiency = 100,000 / 104,840 ≈ 0.9536 or 95.36%, which rounds to 95.4%, but again, no option matches.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to not include the shunt field's copper loss, leading to an efficiency of 95.36%, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option I: 0.880, but that seems too low.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the shunt field's copper loss. Let me recheck.

Shunt field current I_sh = 2.6 A.

Shunt field resistance R_sh = V / I_sh = 250 / 2.6 ≈ 96.15 ohms.

Copper loss P_sh = I_sh² * R_sh = (2.6)^2 * 96.15 ≈ 6.76 * 96.15 ≈ 651 W.

That seems correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the shunt field's copper loss is not part of the generator's losses when calculating efficiency because it's part of the excitation system. So the total losses are 3840 + 1000 = 4840 W.

Efficiency = 100,000 / (100,000 + 4840) ≈ 95.36%, which isn't an option.

Given that none of the options match, perhaps the intended approach is to ignore the shunt field's copper loss and the rotational losses, which would be incorrect but might lead to one of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to calculate the efficiency as:

η = (Output Power) / (Output Power + Rotational Losses + Stray Load Loss)

So η = 100,000 / (100,000 + 3840 + 1000) = 100,000 / 104,840 ≈ 0.9536 or 95.36%, which rounds to 95%, option J.

But I'm not sure. Given the confusion, perhaps the intended answer is option E: 0.847, but that seems too low. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to not include the shunt field's copper loss and to calculate the efficiency as follows:

Efficiency = (Output Power) / (Output Power + Rotational Losses + Stray Load Loss)

Which gives 100,000 / (100,000 + 3840 + 1000) = 100,000 / 104,840 ≈ 0.9536, which is approximately 95.4%, close to option J: 0.950.

But since that's not an exact match, perhaps the intended answer is option I: 0.880, but I'm not confident.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects us to calculate the copper losses for the armature, series, and commutating fields and not the shunt field, and not to include the rotational losses. That would be incorrect, but let's try.

Armature copper loss: 1,920 W

Series copper loss: 640 W

Commutating copper loss: 640 W

Total I²R losses: 1,920 + 640 + 640 = 3,200 W.

But the problem says stray-load loss is 1% of output, which is 1,000 W, conflicting with this.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed so that the stray-load loss is 1% of the output, and the rotational losses are 3840 W, and the shunt field's copper loss is 651 W. So total losses are 3840 + 1000 + 651 = 5491 W.

Efficiency = 100,000 / (100,000 + 5491) ≈ 0.948, which is 94.8%, not an option.

Given all this confusion, perhaps the intended answer is option E: 0.847, but that doesn't align with any calculations I've done. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula where efficiency is calculated as:

η = (P_output) / (P_output + P_rot + P_stray)

Which would be 100,000 / (100,000 + 3840 + 1000) ≈ 0.9536, which is 95.36%, closest to option J: 0.950.

But since that's not an exact match, perhaps the intended answer is option I: 0.880, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to not include the shunt field's copper loss and to not include the rotational losses, which would be incorrect but might lead to an answer matching the options.

Wait, if we only include the stray-load loss of 1,000 W, then total losses are 1,000 W.

Efficiency = 100,000 / (100,000 + 1,000) = 100,000 / 101,000 ≈ 0.990, which is not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to not include the rotational losses, which would be incorrect but could lead to an answer.

But I think the correct approach is to include all losses, leading to 94.8% efficiency, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option J: 0.950.
</think>

To calculate the rated-load efficiency of the compound generator, the following steps were considered:

1. **Output Power**: The generator's rated output is 100 kW.

2. **Stray-Load Loss**: Given as 1% of the output, which is \( 1\% \times 100,000 = 1,000 \, \text{W} \).

3. **Rotational Losses**: Given as 3,840 W on no load, assumed constant under load.

4. **Shunt Field Copper Loss**: The shunt field current is 2.60 A, and its resistance is calculated as \( R_{sh} = \frac{V}{I_{sh}} = \frac{250}{2.6} \approx 96.15 \, \Omega \). The copper loss is \( P_{sh} = I_{sh}^2 \cdot R_{sh} = (2.6)^2 \cdot 96.15 \approx 651 \, \text{W} \).

5. **Total Losses**: The total losses at rated load include rotational losses, stray-load losses, and shunt field copper loss:
   \[
   P_{\text{total losses}} = 3,840 + 1,000 + 651 = 5,491 \, \text{W}.
   \]

6. **Input Power**: The input power to the generator is the sum of the output power and total losses:
   \[
   P_{\text{input}} = 100,000 + 5,491 = 105,491 \, \text{W}.
   \]

7. **Efficiency**: Efficiency is calculated as:
   \[
   \eta = \frac{P_{\text{output}}}{P_{\text{input}}} = \frac{100,000}{105,491} \approx 0.948 \, \text{or} \, 94.8\%.
   \]

However, this value does not match any of the provided options. Reassessing the problem, it is possible that the shunt field copper loss is not included in the efficiency calculation, as it may be considered part of the excitation system. Excluding it, the total losses would be:
\[
P_{\text{total losses}} = 3,840 + 1,000 = 4,840 \, \text{W}.
\]
The input power then becomes:
\[
P_{\text{input}} = 100,000 + 4,840 = 104,840 \, \text{W}.
\]
The efficiency is:
\[
\eta = \frac{100,000}{104,840} \approx 0.9536 \, \text{or} \, 95.36\%.
\]
This is still not an exact match to the options. Given the closest option and potential approximations, the most reasonable choice is **J: 0.950**.
