Question:

Eighty-three monozygotic twin pairs are examined for the presence of club feet. Fifty pairs do not show the trait at all; twenty pairs have one member with club feet; and thirteen pairs have both members affected. What is the frequency of concordance?

A: 60 percent
B: 42 percent
C: 20 percent
D: 50 percent
E: 75 percent
F: 24 percent
G: 39 percent
H: 33 percent
I: 15.5 percent
J: 13 percent

Okay, so I've got this question about monozygotic twins and club feet. I remember that monozygotic twins are identical, meaning they share the same genetic material. The question is asking about concordance frequency, which I think refers to how often both twins show the same trait. 

So, the data given is: 83 twin pairs in total. Out of these, 50 pairs don't show the trait at all. That means both twins in these pairs are unaffected. Then, 20 pairs have one member with club feet. So, in these cases, one twin has it, the other doesn't. Finally, 13 pairs have both members affected, meaning both twins have club feet.

I think concordance is calculated by the number of pairs where both twins have the trait, divided by the total number of pairs. So, I should take the 13 pairs where both are affected and divide by 83 total. Let me do that calculation: 13 divided by 83. Hmm, 13/83 is approximately 0.156, which is about 15.6%. Wait, but looking at the options, I see option I is 15.5% and J is 13%. Wait, maybe I should double-check if I'm considering the right approach.

Wait, another thought: concordance can sometimes be calculated as the proportion of twin pairs where both have the trait, but sometimes it's expressed as a percentage of all affected individuals. But no, I think in this context, it's just the proportion of twin pairs where both are affected. So 13 out of 83. Let me compute that again. 13 divided by 83 equals approximately 0.156, which is 15.6%. The closest option is I:15.5% and J:13%. Hmm, perhaps I should think if there's another way.

Alternatively, maybe the question is asking for the proportion where both are affected, so 13 pairs out of 83, which is approximately 15.66%, so 15.6%. The options don't have 15.6%, but option I is 15.5%. So that's probably the answer. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to calculate it differently, like considering the affected cases.

Wait, another approach: the total number of affected individuals. Let's see, 20 pairs have one affected, so 20 cases, and 13 pairs have both, so 26 cases. Total affected individuals would be 20 + 26 = 46. Then, the number of twin pairs with both affected is 13. But wait, that's still 13 pairs, not 26. So concordance is 13/83, which is approximately 15.66%, so 15.6%, which isn't exactly any of the options except I:15.5% or J:13%. Wait, perhaps the question is using a different method.

Wait, maybe they're asking for the proportion of twins rather than pairs. No, I think concordance is per pair. So 13 pairs out of 83 is 13/83 â‰ˆ 15.66%, so 15.6%. The closest option is I:15.5% but that's 15.5, which is a bit off. Alternatively, perhaps the exact fraction is 13/83, which is approximately 15.66%. Hmm, but the options don't have that. Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the total. Let me check: 50 pairs with none, 20 with one, 13 with both. 50+20+13=83, which matches. So 13 is correct.

Wait, but looking at the options, I see option I is 15.5%, which is close to 15.66%, so perhaps that's the intended answer. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the question is about the proportion of affected cases that are concordant. Wait, but no, concordance is usually the proportion of twin pairs where both are affected. So I think 13/83 is correct, which is approximately 15.66%, so the closest option is I:15.5%. Alternatively, perhaps the exact value is 13/83 = 0.1566, which is 15.66%, but since the options don't have that, maybe I made a mistake elsewhere.

Wait another angle: maybe the question is considering the frequency as the percentage of twins affected in both. No, that's not what concordance is. Concordance is about the pairs. So I think I'm correct with 15.6%. So the answer should be I:15.5%.

The frequency of concordance is calculated by dividing the number of twin pairs where both members are affected (13) by the total number of twin pairs (83). This results in approximately 15.6%. The closest option provided is I:15.5%.
