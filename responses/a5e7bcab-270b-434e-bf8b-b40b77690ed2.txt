Okay, so I need to figure out the maximum amount a home buyer can borrow given the conditions. Let me break down the problem step by step.

The buyer can spend no more than $800 per month on mortgage payments. The interest rate is 9% per annum, the term is 20 years, and both interest and payments are compounded and made continuously. Hmm, continuous compounding usually involves some calculus, right?

I remember that for continuous compounding and continuous payments, the formula for the present value of an annuity involves integrating the payment stream over time. The formula is something like:

P = (Payment rate) * (e^(rt) - 1) / (r)

Wait, no, that's not exactly right. Let me think again. Oh right, the formula for the present value of a continuous annuity is:

P = (C / r) * (e^(rt) - 1)

Where:
- P is the principal amount (the loan amount),
- C is the continuous payment rate,
- r is the annual interest rate,
- t is the time in years.

So in this problem, C is $800 per month. But since we're dealing with continuous payments, I should convert that monthly amount into a continuous rate. To do that, I can multiply the monthly payment by 12 to get an annual rate, but since it's continuous, it's actually the integral over time. Wait, no, maybe I should think of it as the payment rate per year, but spread continuously. So perhaps the correct approach is to convert the monthly payment into an equivalent continuous payment.

Alternatively, I might be confusing this with discrete payments. Let me check. For continuous payments, the formula I think is:

P = (C * (e^(rt) - 1)) / r

Where C is the continuous payment rate. So first, I need to find C in terms of the monthly payment.

Wait, no, maybe C is the payment per unit time, so if it's $800 per month, then in terms of annual continuous payments, it's 800 multiplied by 12, but I'm not sure. Or perhaps, since the payments are made continuously, the payment rate C is $800/month, which is equivalent to $800 * 12 per year, but that's not correct because continuous compounding and payments would have the rate as dollars per unit time, so perhaps C is $800/month, which is $9600/year, but I think I'm mixing concepts here.

Wait, maybe I should approach it differently. Let me recall the formula correctly. The present value P of a continuous annuity with continuous payments is given by:

P = (C / r) * (e^(rt) - 1)

Where C is the continuous payment rate per year. So for example, if you pay C dollars per year continuously, then the formula applies. But in our case, the payments are $800 per month, so to get C in dollars per year, we can calculate it as C = 800 * 12 = $9600 per year. Wait, but that's treating it as a discrete monthly payment converted to an annual rate, which isn't quite right because continuous payments are different. Alternatively, perhaps C is just $800 per month, so per year it's 800*12, but I'm not sure if that's the right approach.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The formula is P = (C / r) * (e^(rt) - 1), where C is the continuous payment rate. So if the buyer can pay $800 per month, that's a payment every month, but since it's continuous, perhaps the payment rate is $800/month, so C = 800. But wait, the interest rate is 9% per annum, so r = 0.09, and t = 20 years.

Wait, but if I use C as $800/month, that's $800 per month, so over a year, that's 12 times that. But in continuous terms, I think C should be in dollars per year, so perhaps C = 800 * 12 = $9600 per year. Let me check that.

Wait, no, I think I'm making a mistake here. Let me clarify: in continuous annuity, the payment is made continuously, so the rate is in dollars per year. So if the payment is $800 per month, that's equivalent to 800 * 12 = $9600 per year, but that's discrete. However, in continuous payments, it's more about the rate at which you're paying, so perhaps C is $800 per month, which is $800/12 per year? No, that doesn't make sense because $800/month is a higher rate than $800/year.

Wait, perhaps I should keep C as $800 per month, but then convert it into a per-year rate by multiplying by 12, so C = 800 * 12 = $9600 per year. So then, using the formula:

P = (C / r) * (e^(rt) - 1) = (9600 / 0.09) * (e^(0.09*20) - 1)

Let me compute that step by step.

First, calculate 0.09 * 20 = 1.8.

e^1.8: Let me compute that. e^1 is about 2.71828, e^1.8 is approximately 6.05, but let me check more accurately:

Using a calculator, e^1.8 ≈ 6.05.

So e^1.8 - 1 ≈ 5.05.

Now, 9600 / 0.09 = 9600 / 0.09 = let's compute that: 9600 ÷ 0.09.

0.09 goes into 9600 how many times? 9600 ÷ 0.09 = 9600 * (100/9) = 960000/9 ≈ 106,666.67.

So P ≈ 106,666.67 * 5.05 ≈ ?

Let me compute 106,666.67 * 5 = 533,333.35

106,666.67 * 0.05 = 5,333.33

So total ≈ 533,333.35 + 5,333.33 ≈ 538,666.68.

Wait, but that seems too high because the options don't go that high. The highest option is E: $120,000.00. So I must have made a mistake in my approach.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the formula. Let me double-check the formula for continuous payments. Maybe the correct formula is:

P = (C / r) * (1 - e^(-rt))

Wait, no, that's for a loan being paid off with continuous payments. Let me check the correct formula.

Wait, I think the formula is actually:

P = (C / r) * (e^(rt) - 1)

Because when you make continuous payments, the present value is the integral from 0 to t of C*e^(-r(t - τ)) dτ, which evaluates to (C/r)(e^(rt) - 1).

Alternatively, another source I recall says that the present value of a continuous annuity is (C / r)(e^(rt) - 1). So that's the formula I should use.

But when I plug in the numbers, I get a P that's way higher than the options given. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let's try a different approach. Maybe I should treat the payments as a continuous stream of $800 per month, which is $800/month = $800/12 per year ≈ $66.67 per year. But that can't be right because that would make C too low.

Wait, no, that's not correct. The payment rate C is in dollars per year, so if the payment is $800 per month, that's 800 * 12 = $9600 per year. So C = 9600 per year.

So let's redo the calculation:

r = 0.09, t = 20 years.

e^(rt) = e^(0.09*20) = e^1.8 ≈ 6.05.

So (e^(rt) - 1) ≈ 5.05.

C/r = 9600 / 0.09 = 106,666.67.

So P = 106,666.67 * 5.05 ≈ 538,666.67, which is way higher than any of the options, so I must have messed up somewhere.

Wait, maybe I'm using the wrong formula. Another thought: perhaps the formula for the present value when payments are made continuously is:

P = (C / r)(1 - e^(-rt))

Wait, no, that's for a loan being repaid with continuous payments. Let me check.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to derive it.

The present value P is the integral from 0 to t of C*e^(-rτ) dτ, where τ is time. So integrating:

P = ∫₀^t C e^(-rτ) dτ = [ (-1/r) C e^(-rτ) ] from 0 to t

= (-C/(r)) [ e^(-rt) - 1 ] = (C/r)(1 - e^(-rt)).

Wait, that's the formula I thought earlier. So P = (C/r)(1 - e^(-rt)).

Wait, but in my initial approach, I used (C/r)(e^(rt) - 1), which is the same as (C/r)e^(rt) - (C/r). But if I use the correct formula, it's (C/r)(1 - e^(-rt)).

Wait, perhaps I mixed up the formula. Let me make sure. The present value of a continuous stream of payments is indeed (C/r)(1 - e^(-rt)). So I think I made a mistake earlier by using e^(rt) instead of e^(-rt).

So let's correct that.

So the formula is:

P = (C / r) * (1 - e^(-rt))

Now, let's plug in the numbers again.

C = 800 per month. Wait, but in this formula, C is the payment rate per year. So if the payment is $800 per month, then the annual payment rate is 800 * 12 = $9600 per year. So C = 9600.

r = 0.09, t = 20.

So rt = 0.09 * 20 = 1.8.

e^(-1.8) ≈ 1/e^1.8 ≈ 1/6.05 ≈ 0.1653.

So 1 - e^(-1.8) ≈ 1 - 0.1653 ≈ 0.8347.

Now, compute (9600 / 0.09) * 0.8347.

First, 9600 / 0.09 = 106,666.6667.

Multiply by 0.8347: 106,666.6667 * 0.8347 ≈ ?

Let me compute that:

106,666.6667 * 0.8 = 85,333.3333

106,666.6667 * 0.0347 ≈ 106,666.6667 * 0.03 = 3,200.0000

106,666.6667 * 0.0047 ≈ approx 500.0000

So total ≈ 3,200 + 500 = 3,700.

So total is approx 85,333.33 + 3,700 = 89,033.33.

Looking at the options, option F is $89,034.79, which is very close to this value. So I think that's the correct answer.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation more accurately.

Compute 106,666.6667 * 0.8347.

Let me compute 106,666.6667 * 0.8347:

First, 100,000 * 0.8347 = 83,470.

6,666.6667 * 0.8347 ≈ 6,666.6667 * 0.8 = 5,333.3333

6,666.6667 * 0.0347 ≈ approx 231.4815.

So total for 6,666.6667 is 5,333.3333 + 231.4815 ≈ 5,564.8148.

So total P ≈ 83,470 + 5,564.8148 ≈ 89,034.8148.

Which rounds to approximately $89,034.81, which matches option F: $89,034.79. Close enough, considering rounding during calculations.
</think>

To determine the maximum amount the buyer can afford, we use the formula for the present value of a continuous annuity:

\[
P = \frac{C}{r} \left(1 - e^{-rt}\right)
\]

Where:
- \( C = \$800 \) per month, converted to an annual payment rate: \( C = 800 \times 12 = \$9600 \)
- \( r = 9\% = 0.09 \)
- \( t = 20 \) years

First, calculate \( rt = 0.09 \times 20 = 1.8 \).

Next, compute \( e^{-rt} \approx e^{-1.8} \approx 0.1653 \).

Then, \( 1 - e^{-rt} \approx 1 - 0.1653 = 0.8347 \).

Now, substitute into the formula:

\[
P = \frac{9600}{0.09} \times 0.8347 \approx 106,666.67 \times 0.8347 \approx 89,034.79
\]

Thus, the maximum amount the buyer can afford to borrow is approximately \$89,034.79.
