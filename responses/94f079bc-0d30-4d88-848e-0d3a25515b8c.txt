Alright, let me try to figure this out. The question is about inferring what Doregelès recalled regarding mobilization in 1914. The passage provided is from his work "After 50 Years," written around 1965.

So, the passage starts with someone shouting about an announcement at the mayor's office. The narrator rushes to Rue Drout and reads that mobilization will begin on Sunday, August 2, 1914. He says it was an announcement to a million and a half Frenchmen. The word "War!" is capitalized, which probably emphasizes the realization of war.

Then, the narrator is described as dead tired but exhilarated. He goes back to the office of Georges Clemenceau, their chief. When he bursts into the office, Clemenceau asks, "What is Paris saying?" The narrator responds, "It's singing, sir!" Clemenceau then says, "It will be all right then."

Okay, so I need to unpack this. The key point here is the reaction of Paris. The narrator uses the metaphor of Paris "singing." Singing could indicate a positive reaction, like celebration or enthusiasm. The fact that Paris is "singing" suggests that people were happy or upbeat about the mobilization.

Clemenceau's response, "It will be all right then," supports this. Clemenceau was a prominent French statesman, and if he's reacting positively, it's likely that the sentiment was widespread. The narrator himself feels exhilarated, which is a positive emotion.

Now, looking at the options:

A: Sorrow in Paris – Doesn't fit because the passage suggests a positive reaction.
B: Fear and apprehension – Doesn't match; they seem happy.
C: Skepticism – No, the reaction is positive.
D: Indifference – Not the case here.
E: Sorrow all across Europe – Passage only mentions Paris.
F: Indifference across Europe – Again, not relevant.
G: Skepticism across Europe – Doesn't fit.
H: Enthusiasm across Europe – The passage doesn't say about other places.
I: Fear across Europe – No, the passage doesn't suggest that.
J: Enthusiasm in Paris – This matches because Paris is described as singing, and the narrator is exhilarated.

So, the inference is that in Paris, the mobilization was greeted with great enthusiasm. The answer should be J.

The passage describes the narrator's experience upon learning of the mobilization announcement in Paris in 1914. The reaction of the crowd is depicted as enthusiastic, with Paris "singing," indicating a positive and excited response. This aligns with the inference that the mobilization was greeted with great enthusiasm in Paris.

Answer: J
