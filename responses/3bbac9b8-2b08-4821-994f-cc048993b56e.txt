Question:

This question refers to the following information.
One of the rights which the freeman has always guarded with most jealous care is that of enjoying the rewards of his own industry. Realizing that the power to tax is the power to destroy and that the power to take a certain amount of property or of income is only another way of saying that for a certain proportion of his time a citizen must work for the government, the authority to impose a tax on the people has been most carefully guarded.… A government which lays taxes on the people not required by urgent necessity and sound public policy is not a protector of liberty, but an instrument of tyranny. It condemns the citizen to tyranny. One of the first signs of the breaking down of free government is a disregard by the taxing power of the right of the people to their own property.… Unless the people can enjoy that reasonable security in the possession of their property, which is guaranteed by the Constitution, against unreasonable taxation, freedom is at an end.… With us economy is imperative. It is a full test of our national character.… It is always the people who toil that pay.
—Calvin Coolidge, "Economy in the Interest of All," June 30, 1924

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about U.S. presidents and their sentiments regarding taxes and government power, based on a quote from Calvin Coolidge. I need to figure out which president would most likely share Coolidge's views. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll read the quote carefully. Coolidge is talking about the importance of protecting individual property rights and the dangers of excessive taxation. He mentions that taxing power can be destructive if not used carefully and that it's a sign of tyranny when taxes aren't necessary. He also emphasizes the need for economy and that hardworking people are the ones who pay taxes.

So, Coolidge is advocating for limited government intervention, lower taxes, and a strong emphasis on personal property rights. He seems to be against excessive taxation and believes that taxes should only be imposed when absolutely necessary for public good. This sounds a lot like small-government conservatism.

Now, looking at the options provided:

A: Dwight D. Eisenhower – He was a Republican, known for moderation and fiscal conservatism, but I'm not sure if he's as strongly anti-tax as Coolidge.

B: John F. Kennedy – A Democrat, known for his progressive policies, tax cuts to stimulate the economy, but his approach was more about using taxes for social programs.

C: Lyndon B. Johnson – Also a Democrat, known for the Great Society and expanding the federal government, which would be opposite to Coolidge's views.

D: George W. Bush – A Republican, known for tax cuts, especially for the wealthy, and his administration increased the national debt. He might align with Coolidge's views on lower taxes.

E: Ronald Reagan – A strong conservative, known for his supply-side economics, tax cuts, and small government. He's probably the closest match to Coolidge's sentiments.

F: Bill Clinton – A Democrat, known for balancing the budget but also for increasing taxes on the wealthy. His policies were more centrist, so less likely to align with Coolidge.

G: Barack Obama – A progressive Democrat, known for increasing taxes on the wealthy and expanding government programs, which goes against Coolidge's views.

H: Franklin D. Roosevelt – A Democrat, known for the New Deal, which expanded government intervention and increased taxes to fund social programs. Opposite to Coolidge.

I: Jimmy Carter – A Democrat, focused on welfare and energy policies, but also a more moderate president. Not likely to share Coolidge's views.

J: Richard Nixon – A Republican, known for economic policies like wage and price controls, but he also implemented tax reforms. However, his approach was more about managing the economy rather than strictly opposing high taxes.

So, considering all this, Coolidge's sentiments align most closely with a president who believed in limited government, lower taxes, and economic conservatism. Ronald Reagan is famous for his "Reaganomics," which focused on reducing taxes, especially for higher earners, to stimulate economic growth. His administration pushed for significant tax cuts and a smaller government role, which matches Coolidge's views.

While George W. Bush also cut taxes, his policies were more about national security and the War on Terror, and his tax cuts were part of a broader economic strategy that included other aspects like healthcare reform. Reagan's policies were more directly aligned with the philosophical stance against big government and high taxes.

Therefore, the answer should be E: Ronald Reagan.

The correct answer is E: Ronald Reagan.
