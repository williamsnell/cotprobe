Question:

Which statement about protein digestion and absorption is most correct?


Options:

A: The products of protein digestion may be absorbed as free amino acids or as di- or tripeptides
B: Gastric digestion of all proteins is equally efficient because of the grinding action of the antrum
C: Gastric zymogenic (chief) cells produce and secrete chymotrypsin, elastase and carboxypeptidase A and this initiates the process of protein digestion
D: The products of digestion of dietary protein by luminal and brush-border enzymes are only absorbed by one of the 14 different amino acid transporters

Answer:

Okay, so I have this question about protein digestion and absorption, and I need to figure out which statement is correct. Let's go through each option one by one.

Starting with option A: "The products of protein digestion may be absorbed as free amino acids or as di- or tripeptides." I remember that during digestion, proteins are broken down into smaller peptides, not just amino acids. The stomach and small intestine break them into dipeptides and tripeptides, which are then absorbed. Also, some amino acids might be absorbed directly. So A sounds correct, but let me check the other options.

Option B: "Gastric digestion of all proteins is equally efficient because of the grinding action of the antrum." Wait, the antrum's grinding action, which I think is the muscular movement that chews up food, but does this make digestion efficient for all proteins equally? I don't think so. Different proteins have varying structures, and the efficiency might depend on the enzymes present, not just mechanical action. So B might not be correct.

Option C: "Gastric zymogenic (chief) cells produce and secrete chymotrypsin, elastase and carboxypeptidase A and this initiates the process of protein digestion." Hmm, I recall that chief cells actually produce pepsinogen, which is activated by hydrochloric acid into pepsin. Chymotrypsin, elastase, and carboxypeptidase A are more associated with pancreatic enzymes, not the stomach. So C is incorrect.

Option D: "The products of digestion of dietary protein by luminal and brush-border enzymes are only absorbed by one of the 14 different amino acid transporters." Wait, I thought there are several transporters for different amino acids. For example, some transporters are specific for certain amino acids or groups. So saying "only one" doesn't make sense. There are multiple transporters, so D is incorrect.

So putting it all together, option A is correct because it accurately describes that the absorption can be either free amino acids or small peptides.
