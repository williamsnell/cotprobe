Question:

The hormone which brings about metamorphosis of the cecropia moth is secreted by a gland in the thorax. However, no metamorphosis takes place if the head is cut off, even though the larva continues to live. Explain.

Options:

A: The gland in the thorax is the only gland involved, but it requires a signal from the head to start metamorphosis.
B: Only the gland in the head is necessary for metamorphosis.
C: The gland in the head secretes a different hormone necessary for the initiation of the metamorphosis process.
D: The gland in the thorax secretes the hormone, but the head must be present to activate it.
E: Metamorphosis is triggered by environmental factors, not by hormones secreted by glands.
F: Metamorphosis is controlled by a gland in the abdomen, not the thorax or the head.
G: The head contains an inhibitor that prevents the gland in the thorax from inducing metamorphosis.
H: Neither the gland in the head nor the gland in the thorax are necessary for metamorphosis.
I: Both the gland in the head and the gland in the thorax of the cecropia moth are necessary for the process of metamorphosis.
J: Only the gland in the thorax is necessary for metamorphosis.

Okay, so I have this biology question in front of me about the cecropia moth's metamorphosis. I'm a bit rusty on my insect physiology, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question says that the hormone causing metamorphosis is secreted by a gland in the thorax. But if the head is cut off, metamorphosis doesn't happen even though the larva stays alive. Hmm, that's interesting. So the presence of the head is crucial for the process, even though the hormone is from the thorax.

I remember that in insects, the brain or the head region plays a significant role in controlling various hormones. There's something about the brain sending signals to other parts. Oh right, the prothoracic glands are in the thorax and are responsible for producing the juvenile hormone and other hormones related to molting and metamorphosis. But I also recall that the brain has a role in regulating these glands.

Wait, the prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH) is produced by the brain and acts on the prothoracic glands to stimulate them to release ecdysterone, which is crucial for metamorphosis. So if the head is removed, the brain can't produce PTTH, which means the prothoracic glands in the thorax don't get the signal to release the necessary hormones. That would explain why metamorphosis doesn't occur even if the thoracic gland is present.

Looking at the options, A says the thorax gland is the only one involved but needs a signal from the head to start. That makes sense because without the head, the signal isn't there. Option C suggests the head has a different hormone needed for initiation. I think that's a bit off because the main hormone is from the thorax, but the head provides the trigger.

Option D says the head must activate the thorax gland. That aligns with what I was thinking about PTTH activating the prothoracic glands. So the head's presence is necessary to activate the hormone release from the thorax.

Option J says only the thorax gland is necessary, but the example shows it's not sufficient without the head. So J can't be right because the head's presence is required.

So between A and D. A states the thorax is the only gland but needs a head signal. D says the head must activate the thorax's hormone. Both seem similar, but D is more precise about the activation needing the head.

Wait, the question says the hormone is secreted by the thorax gland, but no metamorphosis without the head. So the thorax has the hormone, but without the head's signal, it doesn't work. So the head's presence is needed to activate the thorax's hormone release.

So the correct answer would be A or D. Let me check the options again. Option A says the thorax is the only gland but requires a signal from the head to start. Option D says the head must be present to activate the thorax's hormone.

I think D is more accurate because the head isn't just sending a signal; without the head, the activation doesn't happen. So the presence of the head is necessary for the activation of the thorax's hormone, which then triggers metamorphosis.

Another angle: if the head is removed, but the thorax is intact, the hormone isn't released because the head's signal is missing. So the thorax alone can't initiate the process without that signal.

So the best answer is D. The head must be present to activate the thorax's hormone.

The correct answer is **D**. The head must be present to activate the hormone secreted by the gland in the thorax, which is necessary for metamorphosis. The head plays a crucial role in signaling the thorax gland to release the hormone, and without this activation, metamorphosis cannot occur.

Answer: D
