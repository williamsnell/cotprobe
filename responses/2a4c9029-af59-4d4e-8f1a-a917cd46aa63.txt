Okay, so I have this problem here about a sofa's markup. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question says the sofa has a markup of 20% based on its selling price, and I need to find the percent markup based on the cost. Hmm, I'm a bit confused about the difference between markup based on selling price and based on cost, but I'll try to work it out.

First, I remember that markup refers to the amount added to the cost to get the selling price. So if the markup is based on the selling price, that means the 20% is calculated on the selling price itself. Let me denote the cost as C and the selling price as S. 

So, the markup is 20% of S, which would be 0.2 * S. The selling price is then the cost plus the markup, right? So S = C + 0.2S. That makes sense because the selling price is the cost plus 20% of the selling price.

Wait, let me write that equation again. S = C + 0.2S. I can rearrange this to solve for C. Subtract 0.2S from both sides: S - 0.2S = C. That simplifies to 0.8S = C. So, the cost is 80% of the selling price. 

But I need to find the markup based on the cost. Markup based on cost is calculated as (Markup / Cost) * 100%. The markup is 0.2S, and the cost is C, which is 0.8S. So, the markup percentage based on cost would be (0.2S / 0.8S) * 100%. 

Oh, wait, the S cancels out here, so it's 0.2 / 0.8 = 0.25. Multiply by 100% gives 25%. So the markup based on cost is 25%. 

Let me double-check that. If the cost is $100, then the selling price would be cost plus 20% of selling price. Wait, that would be S = 100 + 0.2S. Subtract 0.2S from both sides: 0.8S = 100. So S = 100 / 0.8 = 125. The markup is 125 - 100 = 25. So markup is $25 on a cost of $100, which is 25%. Yep, that checks out.

So looking at the options, I think the correct answer is I: 25%. Let me make sure I didn't mix up the markup bases. Sometimes people confuse markup on cost versus markup on selling price. Here, since the given markup is on selling price, converting it to markup on cost gives 25%. So I'm confident with that.

The markup is 20% of the selling price. Let cost be C and selling price be S. The selling price S = C + 0.2S. Rearranging, 0.8S = C. Markup based on cost is (0.2S / C) * 100% = (0.2S / 0.8S) * 100% = 25%.
