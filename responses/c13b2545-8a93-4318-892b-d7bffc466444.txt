Okay, so I have this thermodynamics problem here about argon gas undergoing a state change. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

Alright, the problem says: Ten grams of argon gas are at an initial pressure of 608 kPa and temperature of 300 K. They undergo a change at constant internal energy until the final volume is three times the initial. I need to find the final pressure, temperature, and the entropy change. The options are A to J.

First, I remember that for an ideal gas, the internal energy depends only on temperature. Since the internal energy is constant (ΔU = 0), that means the temperature must remain the same. Oh, right, because ΔU = nCvΔT, and if ΔU is zero, then ΔT is zero. So the temperature doesn't change. That's a key point.

So the initial temperature is 300 K, so the final temperature must also be 300 K. That should rule out any options where the temperature changes, like options B, C, D, F, G, H, I, and J. So only options A, E, and maybe others left? Wait, let me check.

Looking at the options, option A has final temp 300 K, which fits. Option E also has 300 K. Option J has 300 K too. Wait, but option J's pressure is higher, but let me think.

Wait, no, the process is at constant internal energy, so T remains same. So first, the final temperature is 300 K. So options that don't have that are out. So options are A, E, J.

Wait, but the process is at constant internal energy. So for an ideal gas, internal energy U = f(T), so if U is constant, T is constant. So yes, T remains 300 K.

Now, next, the volume triples. So V_final = 3 V_initial.

Since it's an ideal gas, PV = nRT. Let's find initial and final pressures.

But wait, the mass is 10 grams of argon. Argon is a noble gas, monoatomic, so its molar mass is about 39.95 g/mol. So moles n = mass / molar mass = 10 g / 39.95 g/mol ≈ 0.250 mol.

But maybe exact value isn't needed; ratios can be used since we'll be dealing with changes.

Since the internal energy is constant, and T is same, the process must be such that the change in internal energy is zero. So we can think about the process in terms of pressure and volume change.

From initial to final, V increases by a factor of 3. So V2 = 3 V1.

But since T is same, for ideal gas, P1 V1 = n R T and P2 V2 = n R T. So P2 = P1 * (V1 / V2). Since V2 is 3 V1, P2 = P1 / 3.

P1 is 608 kPa. So P2 = 608 /3 ≈ 202.666... kPa, which is approximately 202.7 kPa. So the final pressure should be around 202.7 kPa.

Looking at the options, option A is 202.7 kPa and 300 K, which fits. Option E is 608 kPa and 300 K, which would imply no volume change, but the volume triples. So E is probably incorrect because pressure would drop. Option J: 404.3 kPa, which is about double, but our calculation says pressure should be a third. So J is not correct. So between A, E, and J, only A fits the pressure.

Wait, but wait. Another way to think: since internal energy is constant, the process might involve work and heat. But maybe that's complicating things. Since T is same, and V increases, P must decrease.

So now, the entropy change. For an ideal gas, the entropy change ΔS is given by:

ΔS = n R ln(V2/V1) + n Cv ln(T2/T1)

But since T2 = T1, the second term is zero. So ΔS = n R ln(V2/V1)

Alternatively, since pressure changes, we can write:

ΔS = n R ln(P1/P2) [since for ideal gas, S depends on P and T, and since T is same, it's only P that matters here]

Wait, no, actually, for entropy change at constant temperature, the formula using pressure is:

ΔS = n R ln(P1 / P2)

Because when temperature is constant, entropy change is due to pressure change, but wait, I need to double-check.

Wait, the general formula is:

ΔS = n Cp ln(T2/T1) - n R ln(P2/P1)

But since T doesn't change, the first term is zero, so ΔS = -n R ln(P2/P1) = n R ln(P1/P2)

Alternatively, since V2 = 3 V1, and T is same, using ΔS = n R ln(V2/V1) + n Cv ln(T2/T1). Again, since T is same, ΔS = n R ln(3) because V increases by a factor of 3.

Wait, but Cp for argon, which is monoatomic, is (5/2) R, and Cv is (3/2) R.

But since we're using temperature change, which is zero, and the process is at constant internal energy, but perhaps it's isothermal? Wait, no, because internal energy is a function of temperature, so if U is constant, T must be constant. So yes, it's an isothermal process.

Wait, but in an isothermal process for ideal gas, entropy change is ΔS = n R ln(V2/V1) = n R ln(P1/P2)

So let's compute that.

n is 10 g / 39.95 g/mol ≈ 0.2503 mol.

So ΔS = 0.2503 * R * ln(3). R is 8.314 J/mol·K.

Calculating:

ln(3) ≈ 1.0986

So 0.2503 * 8.314 * 1.0986 ≈ let's compute:

First, 0.25 *8.314 ≈ 2.0785

Multiply by 1.0986: 2.0785 * 1.0986 ≈ 2.0785 *1.1 ≈ 2.286 J/K.

So entropy change is about +2.286 J/K.

Looking at the options, option A has entropy change +2.286 J/K, which matches. Option E has 0.2286, which is much lower. Option J's entropy is +1.143, which is half of what we calculated. So option A is correct.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure.

Alternatively, another approach: since the process is at constant internal energy, is it isothermal? Yes, because for ideal gas, internal energy depends only on temperature. So if internal energy doesn't change, temperature doesn't change. So yes, it's isothermal.

In an isothermal process, the entropy change for ideal gas is ΔS = n R ln(V2/V1) = n R ln(P1/P2). Both should give the same result.

So, our calculation gives entropy change of about +2.286 J/K, matching option A.

So the final state is pressure 202.7 kPa, temperature 300 K, and entropy change +2.286 J/K.

The problem involves 10 grams of argon gas undergoing a state change at constant internal energy, with the final volume being three times the initial volume. Since internal energy depends only on temperature for an ideal gas, the temperature remains constant at 300 K. Using the ideal gas law, the pressure decreases by a factor of three, resulting in a final pressure of approximately 202.7 kPa. The entropy change is calculated using the formula for an isothermal process, yielding a positive entropy change of +2.286 J/K. These results match option A.
