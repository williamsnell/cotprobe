Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here. Let's see what it's about. The reaction is CaCO3(s) decomposing into CaO(s) and CO2(g) at 950°C with a CO2 pressure of 1 atm. The enthalpy change, ΔH, is given as 176 kJ per mole. The question is asking for the change in internal energy, ΔE.

Wait, I remember that internal energy (ΔE) and enthalpy (ΔH) are related, especially in reactions involving gases. The formula I think is ΔH = ΔE + Δ(n)RT, where Δ(n) is the change in moles of gas. Oh right, because ΔH accounts for the heat at constant pressure, while ΔE is at constant volume.

So for this reaction, let's break it down. The reactant is CaCO3(s), which is a solid, so it doesn't contribute to the gas moles. The products are CaO(s) and CO2(g). CaO is also a solid, so no gas there. Only CO2 is a gas, so the moles of gas produced are 1 mole. So Δ(n) is 1.

Now, the formula: ΔH = ΔE + Δ(n)RT. We need to solve for ΔE. So rearranging gives ΔE = ΔH - Δ(n)RT.

Wait, but wait. Is the reaction written correctly? The problem states CaCO3(s) → CaCO(s) + CO2(g). Oh wait, CaCO would be calcium carbide? Wait, no, wait. Calcium carbonate is CaCO3, and when it decomposes, it usually forms CaO and CO2. So maybe the reaction should be CaCO3(s) → CaO(s) + CO2(g). Oh, but in the problem, it's written as CaCO(s). Wait, that's a typo perhaps. Because CaCO is not a standard compound; it's more likely CaO. Maybe the problem meant CaO, but I'll proceed with what's given.

Wait, but wait. If the product is CaCO(s), then that's calcium oxide if it's CaO, but the formula would be CaO. Alternatively, perhaps it's a typo and I should proceed with CaO as the product. Alternatively, perhaps it's a mistake and I should proceed as if it's CaO. Well, for the sake of the problem, let's go with what's given: CaCO(s).

But wait, regardless, the moles of gas are 1, because CO2 is gaseous. So Δ(n) = 1.

So, ΔE = ΔH - (Δn)RT.

Wait, but wait, the reaction as written produces 1 mole of CO2(g), so Δn = 1 mole.

Now, R is the gas constant. I remember R is 8.314 J/(mol·K). The temperature is 950°C, which is 1223 K (since 950 + 273.15 ≈ 1223.15 K). But let's use 1223 K for simplicity.

So, plugging the numbers in:

ΔE = 176,000 J/mol (since 176 kJ = 176,000 J) - (1 mol)(8.314 J/(mol·K))(1223 K).

Calculating the second term: 8.314 * 1223 ≈ Let's compute that.

8 * 1223 = 9784, 0.314 * 1223 ≈ 383. So total is approximately 9784 + 383 = 10167 J/mol. Wait, but 8.314 * 1223, let me compute more accurately.

1223 * 8 = 9784.

1223 * 0.3 = 366.9.

1223 * 0.014 = approximately 17.122.

So 9784 + 366.9 = 10150.9, plus 17.122 is about 10168.02 J/mol.

So the second term is approximately 10,168 J/mol.

Now, subtract that from 176,000 J/mol.

176,000 - 10,168 = 165,832 J/mol.

Which is approximately 165.832 kJ/mol.

Looking at the options, option B is 166 kJ, so that should be the answer.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the calculation because sometimes I might make a mistake in the math.

Alternatively, perhaps using more precise R value and temperature.

Alternatively, maybe the problem states that the volume of the solid doesn't change much, so perhaps the work done is negligible, and thus ΔE ≈ ΔH. But that's only if Δn =0, which isn't the case here. Because in this reaction, 1 mole of gas is produced, so Δn=1.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me think again. The formula for ΔH and ΔE is ΔH = ΔE + PΔV. And since Δn is the number of moles of gas, ΔV is nRT/P. So PΔV = nRT.

So yes, ΔH = ΔE + Δn * RT.

Therefore, ΔE = ΔH - Δn * RT.

So that's correct.

So back to the numbers:

Δn =1.

R=8.314 J/(mol·K).

T=950°C = 1223.15 K.

So RT = 8.314 * 1223.15 ≈ Let me calculate this accurately.

Compute 8 * 1223.15 = 9785.2.

0.314 * 1223.15 ≈ Let's compute 0.3 * 1223.15 = 366.945, and 0.014*1223.15≈17.1241. So adding 366.945 +17.1241=384.0691.

So total RT ≈ 9785.2 + 384.0691 = 10169.269 J/mol.

So ΔE = 176,000 J - 10,169.269 J = 165,830.73 J ≈ 165.83 kJ.

Looking at the options, option B is 166 kJ, which is the closest.

The problem involves calculating the change in internal energy (ΔE) for the decomposition reaction of calcium carbonate (CaCO₃) into calcium oxide (CaO) and carbon dioxide gas (CO₂) at 950°C and 1 atm pressure. The enthalpy change (ΔH) is given as 176 kJ/mol. The relationship between ΔH and ΔE is given by the equation:

\[
\Delta H = \Delta E + \Delta n \cdot R \cdot T
\]

where:
- \( \Delta n \) is the change in moles of gas,
- \( R = 8.314 \, \text{J/(mol·K)} \) is the gas constant,
- \( T = 950^\circ \text{C} = 1223 \, \text{K} \) is the temperature in Kelvin.

In the reaction, 1 mole of CO₂ gas is produced, so \( \Delta n = 1 \). Rearranging the equation to solve for ΔE:

\[
\Delta E = \Delta H - \Delta n \cdot R \cdot T
\]

Substituting the values:
\[
\Delta E = 176,000 \, \text{J/mol} - (1) \cdot (8.314 \, \text{J/(mol·K)}) \cdot (1223 \, \text{K})
\]

Calculating the second term:
\[
8.314 \cdot 1223 \approx 10,168 \, \text{J/mol}
\]

Thus:
\[
\Delta E = 176,000 - 10,168 = 165,832 \, \text{J/mol} \approx 165.83 \, \text{kJ/mol}
\]

The closest option to this value is **166 kJ**, which corresponds to option B.
