Okay, so I have this problem where I need to calculate the volume of a cylinder containing 60 lbm of carbon dioxide at 230°F and 23 psig pressure. The atmospheric pressure is given as 14.7 psia. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on gas laws and units, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

First, I remember that when dealing with gas volumes, the ideal gas law is usually used: PV = nRT. But wait, CO2 is a real gas, so maybe the ideal gas law isn't perfectly accurate, but for the purposes of this problem, I think it's acceptable to use it as an approximation.

Let me jot down the given data:
- Mass of CO2 (m) = 60 lbm
- Temperature (T) = 230°F
- Pressure (P) = 23 psig
- Atmospheric pressure (Patm) = 14.7 psia

Wait, pressure is given in psig, which is gauge pressure. So to get absolute pressure, I need to add atmospheric pressure. So P_abs = P_gauge + Patm = 23 psig + 14.7 psia = 37.7 psia. Wait, no, actually, wait: psig is gauge pressure, which is the pressure above atmospheric. So if the atmospheric pressure is 14.7 psia, then the absolute pressure is 23 + 14.7 = 37.7 psia. That makes sense.

Next, I need to convert the units so that they're compatible with the gas law. The ideal gas law usually uses R in units that match the pressure in atm, volume in liters, etc., but since we're dealing with pounds and Fahrenheit, maybe I should find the appropriate R value.

Wait, the units I have are in pounds, Fahrenheit, and psi. I think the standard R value for CO2 might be in different units, but perhaps I can find R in terms of lbm, psi, and degrees Fahrenheit.

Alternatively, maybe I should convert the temperature to Rankine because the ideal gas law requires absolute temperature. So T in Rankine is (230 + 459.67) = 689.67 °R.

Now, I need to find the number of moles (n) of CO2. The molecular weight (M) of CO2 is 44 lbm per mole (since C is 12, O is 16, so 12 + 2*16=44 g/mol, which is 44 lbm per mole when considering lbm as pounds-mass).

So n = m / M = 60 lbm / 44 lbm/mol ≈ 1.3636 mol.

Wait, but wait, I'm using lbm in the denominator, and R might be in different units. Alternatively, maybe I should use the specific form of the ideal gas law that uses lbm, psi, etc.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think. The ideal gas equation can be written as PV = nRT, but the units have to match. Alternatively, sometimes it's written as PV = (m/M) RT, where m is mass in lbm, M is molecular weight in lbm/lbmol, and R is in (psi·ft³)/(lbm·°R).

I think I can find R for CO2 in those units. Alternatively, maybe I can use R in terms of universal gas constant, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should convert everything into standard units like SI, but that might be more complicated.

Wait, let me check. The universal gas constant R is 10.73 (psi·ft³)/(lbmol·°R). Wait, no, wait. Let me think. For the ideal gas law, R is 10.73 psi·ft³/(lbmol·R). So if I have n in lbmol, then n would be 60/44 lbmol, since 44 lbm is one lbmol for CO2.

Wait, so m = 60 lbm, M = 44 lbm/lbmol, so n = 60/44 ≈ 1.3636 lbmol.

So then the ideal gas equation would be PV = nRT, where R is 10.73 psi·ft³/(lbmol·R).

So P is 37.7 psia, V is what I'm solving for, n is 1.3636 lbmol, R is 10.73, and T is 689.67 R.

So rearranging, V = (nRT)/P.

Let me plug in the numbers:

V = (1.3636 lbmol) * (10.73 psi·ft³/(lbmol·R)) * (689.67 R) / (37.7 psi)

Wait, let's compute that step by step.

First, compute nRT: 1.3636 * 10.73 * 689.67.

Let me calculate that:

1.3636 * 10.73 ≈ 14.626.

14.626 * 689.67 ≈ let's see, 14.626 * 700 ≈ 10,238.2, but since it's 689.67, which is about 700 - 10.33, so 14.626 * 10.33 ≈ 151.1. Subtract that from 10,238.2: 10,238.2 - 151.1 ≈ 10,087.1.

So nRT ≈ 10,087.1 (psi·ft³).

Now, divide by P (37.7 psi): 10,087.1 / 37.7 ≈ let's calculate.

37.7 * 268 ≈ 37.7*200=7,540; 37.7*68=2,563.6 → total ≈ 10,103.6. Hmm, which is close to 10,087.1. So 268 would give about 10,103.6, but we have 10,087.1, which is a bit less. So perhaps around 267 or 268.

Wait, 37.7 * 267 = ?

37.7 * 200 = 7,540

37.7 * 60 = 2,262

37.7 *7=263.9 → total 7,540 + 2,262=9,802 +263.9=10,065.9

So 267 gives 10,065.9, which is a bit less than 10,087.1. The difference is 10,087.1 -10,065.9=21.2.

So 21.2 /37.7 ≈ 0.56. So 267.56, so approximately 267.56 ft³.

Looking at the options, F is 268 ft³, which is very close. So the answer should be F.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations because sometimes I might have messed up a step.

Wait, another approach: Let me compute nRT more accurately.

n = 60 /44 = 1.3636 lbmol

R = 10.73 psi·ft³/(lbmol·R)

T = 230°F + 459.67 = 689.67 R

nRT = 1.3636 * 10.73 * 689.67

Compute 1.3636 * 10.73 first.

1.3636 *10 =13.636, 1.3636*0.73= approx 1.3636*0.7=0.9545, 1.3636*0.03=0.0409 → total 0.9545+0.0409≈0.9954. So total 13.636 +0.9954=14.6314.

Now, 14.6314 * 689.67.

Let me compute 14.6314 * 689.67.

First, 14.6314 * 689 = ?

Well, 14.6314 * 700 = 10,241.98. Now subtract 14.6314 *11=160.945.

So 10,241.98 -160.945 =10,081.035.

Wait, no, because 689 is 700 -11, so 14.6314*(700-11)=14.6314*700 -14.6314*11.

Wait, but 14.6314*11=160.9454.

So 14.6314 *689=10,241.98 -160.9454=10,081.0346.

Now, 14.6314 *0.67= approx 14.6314 *0.6=8.77884, 14.6314*0.07=1.0242, so total 8.77884+1.0242=9.80304.

So total nRT =10,081.0346 +9.80304 ≈10,090.8376.

Now, V = nRT /P =10,090.8376 /37.7 ≈ let's compute.

37.7 * 268 = ?

37.7 *200=7,540.

37.7 *60=2,262.

37.7 *8=301.6.

So 7,540 +2,262=9,802 +301.6=10,103.6.

So 37.7 *268=10,103.6.

Our nRT is 10,090.84, which is a bit less than 10,103.6.

So 10,090.84 /37.7 = 268 - (10,103.6 -10,090.84)/(37.7)

The difference is 10,103.6 -10,090.84=12.76.

So 12.76 /37.7 ≈0.338.

So V≈268 -0.338≈267.662 ft³.

Looking at the options, F is 268 ft³, which is the closest. So the answer should be F.

To calculate the volume of the cylinder containing 60 lbm of CO2 at 230°F and 23 psig, the ideal gas law is used with appropriate unit conversions. The absolute pressure is 37.7 psia, and the temperature in Rankine is 689.67 °R. Using the molecular weight of CO2 (44 lbm/lbmol) and the gas constant R (10.73 psi·ft³/(lbmol·°R)), the volume is found to be approximately 267.66 ft³, which rounds to 268 ft³.
