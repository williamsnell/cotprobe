Alright, so I've got this question about cat food brands, and I need to figure out which one claims that their food is so tasty that 'cats ask for it by name.' Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll go through each option one by one and try to remember any advertising slogans or catchphrases associated with them.

Option A: Purina One. I think Purina One is known for being a high-quality, vet-recommended brand. Their ads usually focus on the health benefits and the variety of nutrients they provide. I don't recall them using a phrase where cats ask for it by name, but I'm not entirely sure.

Option B: Hill's Science Diet. This brand is often marketed towards the health and dietary needs of cats. They emphasize things like weight management, sensitive stomachs, and specific health issues. Their commercials usually talk about the science behind their formulas. I don't think they use a catchy phrase like the one mentioned.

Option C: 9-Lives. I remember 9-Lives being a brand that's been around for a while. Their ads often feature a cat that's very active and healthy, with a focus on their well-being. They might have some taglines about being the best for cats, but I'm not sure if it's the one where cats ask by name.

Option D: Cat Chow. Cat Chow is a pretty common brand, and I think their commercials have featured a talking cat who really enjoys the food. The slogan "Cats ask for it by name" rings a bell with Cat Chow. I think their ads have a cat meowing what sounds like "Cat Chow" because it's so tasty.

Option E: Iams. Iams is another well-known brand, often associated with their "Iams" jingle in ads. They focus on the quality and taste of their food, but I don't remember them specifically using that particular phrase.

Option F: Fancy Feast. Fancy Feast is known for its gourmet selection and variety, catering to cats with different tastes. Their ads are more about the variety and the premium ingredients, but I don't think they use the specific slogan in question.

Option G: Meow Mix. Meow Mix has a long history with their "Meow Mix" jingle and a series of talking cats. Their ads often feature a chorus of cats singing about how much they love the food. However, I'm not certain if they use the exact phrase mentioned.

Option H: Royal Canin. Royal Canin is another high-end brand, focusing on tailored nutrition for different breeds and life stages. Their marketing is more about the customization and quality, not necessarily about cats asking for it by name.

Option I: Blue Buffalo. Blue Buffalo emphasizes natural and holistic ingredients. Their ads highlight the health benefits and natural成分, but I don't recall them using that specific tagline.

Option J: Whiskas. Whiskas is a brand I'm familiar with, especially with their wet cat foods. They have a variety of flavors and have done campaigns around cats enjoying their meals, but I'm not sure if they use the "ask by name" phrase.

Putting it all together, the phrase "cats ask for it by name" seems familiar with Cat Chow. Their commercials have a cat meowing "Cat Chow" because it's so delicious. So, I think the correct answer is D: Cat Chow.
