Answer the following multiple choice question, selecting from the answer A through to J. After thinking, reply directly with your answer. 

The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

The citrate ion forms a tight bond with calcium ions so that the calcium is unable to react with other substances In view of this, why is sodium citrate added to whole blood immediately after it is drawn from a blood donor?

Options:

A: Sodium citrate is added to cause muscle spasms
B: Sodium citrate is added to catalyze the formation of fibrin
C: Sodium citrate is added to preserve the blood's color
D: Sodium citrate is added to stimulate immune responses
E: Sodium citrate is added to increase calcium ions
F: Sodium citrate is added to prevent coagulation
G: Sodium citrate is added to increase the blood's viscosity
H: Sodium citrate is added to enhance oxygen carrying capacity of the blood
I: Sodium citrate is added to decrease the blood's pH level
J: Sodium citrate is added as a nutrient for blood cells

Okay, so I have this question about why sodium citrate is added to whole blood after it's drawn. Hmm, I remember from my biology classes that when you draw blood, especially for transfusions, you don't want it to clot. Clotting can make the blood unusable, so they must add something to prevent that.

The question mentions that the citrate ion forms a tight bond with calcium ions, making calcium unavailable. Wait, calcium is involved in blood clotting, right? So if calcium is tied up by citrate, then the blood can't clot because calcium is necessary for the coagulation process. So sodium citrate is probably acting as an anticoagulant.

Looking at the options, option F says it's to prevent coagulation. That makes sense. Let me think about the other options to make sure I'm not missing anything.

Option A: Muscle spasms? No, that doesn't fit. Sodium citrate wouldn't cause that. Option B: Catalyzing fibrin formation? No, that's the opposite of preventing coagulation. Option C: Preserve blood color? I don't think citrate affects color directly. Option D: Stimulate immune responses? Doesn't seem related. Option E: Increase calcium? No, because citrate binds to calcium, making it unavailableâ€”so it decreases free calcium. Option G: Increase viscosity? No, I don't think that's the case. Option H: Enhance oxygen carrying? That's what hemoglobin does, and citrate might affect pH, but not directly increase oxygen. Option I: Decrease pH? Maybe, but the main reason is about preventing clots. Option J: Nutrient for blood cells? I don't recall that being the reason; it's more about anticoagulation.

So yes, the correct answer should be F: prevent coagulation.

The correct answer is **F: Sodium citrate is added to prevent coagulation**. Sodium citrate binds to calcium ions, which are essential for blood clotting, thereby preventing the blood from clotting after collection.

Answer: F
