Okay, so I have this question about finding the median of Brian's team quiz scores. The scores given are 8, 6, 9, 7, 10, 9, 5, 4, 9. Hmm, I remember the median is the middle number when the numbers are arranged in order. But wait, how exactly do I find that?

First, I think I need to sort the scores from the lowest to the highest. Let me list them out again and arrange them. The original scores are 8, 6, 9, 7, 10, 9, 5, 4, 9. So, let's sort them.

Starting with the smallest: 4 is the lowest. Then 5, then 6. Next, the 7 comes after 6. Then we have three 9s, so 9, 9, 9. After that, an 8, but wait, no, 8 comes before 10. Wait, no, I think I made a mistake. Let me list them again step by step.

The numbers are: 8,6,9,7,10,9,5,4,9.

Let me write them in order:

Start with 4 (the smallest). Then 5, then 6, then 7. Next comes 8, then 9, but there are three 9s. So after 8, we have 9, 9, 9. Then the highest is 10.

Wait, let me count: 4,5,6,7,8,9,9,9,10. Yeah, that's nine scores. So the sorted list is 4,5,6,7,8,9,9,9,10.

Now, since there are nine numbers, the median will be the fifth number because the median position is (n+1)/2 where n is the number of terms. So for nine terms, it's (9+1)/2 = 5th term.

Let me count: 1st is 4, 2nd is 5, 3rd is 6, 4th is 7, 5th is 8. So the median is 8.

Wait, but let me double-check. Sometimes I get confused between mean, median, and mode. Median is the middle value when sorted, yes. So in this case, the fifth number is 8. So the median is 8. Looking at the options, option D is 8. So the answer should be D.

The scores are sorted as 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 9, 9, 10. The median is the fifth score, which is 8.

Answer: D
