Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about diffraction gratings, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question has three parts: (a) the resolution of a grating, (b) the separation between two green lines that the grating can resolve, and (c) the width of a glass prism needed to match that resolution. The options are A through J, each giving values for all three parts.

First, part (a): What is the resolution of a grating with 600 lines per mm and 15 cm wide?

Hmm, I remember that the resolution of a grating is often related to the number of lines and the width. The formula I think is resolution R = (n * D), where n is the number of lines and D is the width in the same units. But wait, I should check the units here.

The grating has 600 lines per mm. So, lines per millimeter would be lines/mm. The width is 15 cm, which is 150 mm. So the total number of lines N would be 600 lines/mm * 150 mm = 600 * 150 = 90,000 lines. So N is 90,000.

Wait, but wait! I think the formula for resolution in terms of lines is R = N * λ/δλ, but maybe I'm mixing things up. Alternatively, I think the resolving power R is given by R = N * m, where m is the order, but perhaps for maximum resolution, m is 1? Or maybe I'm confusing it with something else.

Wait, no. I think for a grating, the resolving power R is given by R = (n * D) * sinθ, but when considering maximum efficiency, θ is 90 degrees, so sinθ is 1. So R = n * D. Wait no, that can't be right because D is in millimeters and n is lines per millimeter? Wait, no, n is lines per mm, and D is the width in mm. So R would be (lines/mm) * (mm) = lines. So yes, R = 600 * 150 = 90,000 lines. So part (a) is 90,000. Looking at the options, E is 90,000. So that's the first part.

Wait, but let me make sure. Alternatively, I've heard that the resolving power is R = (N * λ) / d, where N is the number of lines, but that's when considering the wavelength. Wait, no, maybe I'm confusing it with the diffraction formula. Let me think again.

Wait, another formula I came across: The resolving power R is given by R = (n * D) where n is the number of lines per mm, and D is the width in mm. So yes, 600 * 150 = 90,000. So part (a) is 90,000.

So in the options, E has 90,000 for (a). So that's a possible candidate, but I should check the other parts as well.

Part (b): How far apart must two green lines be for the grating to resolve them?

I think the resolving power R is approximately equal to λ/δλ, where δλ is the minimum wavelength difference that can be resolved. So δλ = λ/R.

But wait, I'm not sure if I'm using the correct formula here. Another approach: the condition for resolution is based on the Rayleigh criterion, which says that two wavelengths are resolvable if the angular separation is such that the maxima for one are not coinciding with the minima of the other. The formula is δθ ≥ 1.22 λ / d, where d is the spacing between the lines.

But wait, the spacing d in a grating is 1/n, where n is lines per mm, but wait, n is lines per mm, so d would be in mm. So n = 600 lines/mm, so d = 1/600 mm per line, which is 1/(600) mm = approximately 1.6667e-3 mm, or 1.6667e-6 meters.

Wait, but maybe I should express d in meters. Alternatively, perhaps using the formula for the resolving power: R = λ/δλ, so δλ = λ/R.

Wait, but R is the resolving power, which for a grating is given by R = (n * D) * sinθ. But for maximum R, θ is 90 degrees, so sinθ=1, so R = n * D.

Wait, in part (a), R is 90,000. So for part (b), δλ = λ/R. But wait, the problem doesn't specify the wavelength. Oh wait, green light is around 500 nm to 570 nm. But maybe we can assume a typical value, like 500 nm (which is 5000 Å).

Wait, but the problem says "two green lines", so perhaps it's using a standard wavelength. Alternatively, maybe the problem is using λ as 500 Å, but wait, 1 Å is 0.1 nm, so 500 nm is 5000 Å. Hmm, but let me think again.

Wait, I think I'm getting confused here. The formula for the minimum separation δλ is given by δλ = λ / R, where λ is the wavelength. But without knowing λ, I can't compute it numerically. Wait, but perhaps the question is using a standard wavelength, maybe 5000 Å (which is 500 nm), as an example.

So if λ is 5000 Å, then δλ = 5000 Å / 90,000 ≈ 0.0555... Å. So approximately 0.056 Å. But looking at the options, part (b) values are 0.03, 0.10, 0.09, 0.02, 0.06, 0.11, 0.08, 0.04, 0.07, 0.05.

Wait, 0.056 is closest to 0.06, which is option E's (b) part. But that's in the same option as part (a), which is 90,000. So E's part (b) is 0.06 Å. That matches. But wait, let me double-check. If R is 90,000, then δλ = λ/R. If λ is 5000 Å, then 5000/90,000 is about 0.0555... which rounds to 0.056, which is close to 0.06. So option E's (b) is 0.06 Å. So part (b) would be 0.06 Å.

Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the formula. Another approach: The resolving power R is the number of lines times the width, which gives R = 90,000. The resolving power can also be expressed as R = λ/δλ. So δλ = λ/R. But without knowing λ, maybe the question is using a different approach.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the grating equation. The grating equation is d sinθ = mλ, where d is the spacing between lines, m is the order, and λ is the wavelength. The resolving power comes into play when the angular separation is sufficient to distinguish two wavelengths. The condition for just resolvable lines is that the angle between the two maxima is at least the diffraction limit, which is given by the Rayleigh criterion: δθ ≥ 1.22 λ / (d). 

But the angular separation between two wavelengths λ1 and λ2 would be δθ = (λ2 - λ1) * m / d. So setting this equal to 1.22 λ / d, we get (λ2 - λ1) * m / d = 1.22 λ / d. The d cancels, so (λ2 - λ1) * m = 1.22 λ. 

But I'm not sure if I'm on the right track here. Alternatively, the resolving power R is given by R = λ / δλ, which is the same as δλ = λ / R. So if we take λ as 5000 Å, then δλ = 5000 / 90,000 ≈ 0.0555 Å, which is approximately 0.056 Å. So the closest value in the options is 0.06 Å, which is option E's (b). So part (b) is 0.06 Å.

Now part (c): How wide would a glass prism have to be to give the same resolution as the grating?

Hmm, prisms disperse light based on their refractive index and the angle of the prism. The resolving power of a prism is different from a grating, but I think the formula for the resolving power of a prism is R_prism = (n - 1) * d * sinθ / λ, where n is the refractive index, d is the base width, and θ is the angle of the prism. But wait, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Alternatively, I remember that the resolving power of a prism (R_p) is given by R_p = (n - 1) * b, where b is the length of the base of the prism. So if a prism has a base width (b), then R_p = (n-1) * b. We need this to equal the grating's resolving power, which is 90,000.

But we don't know the refractive index of the glass. Hmm, maybe the question assumes a typical value, like n=1.5 for glass. So let's say n=1.5, then (n-1)=0.5. So R_p = 0.5 * b. We set this equal to 90,000, so 0.5 * b = 90,000 → b = 180,000. But that's way too big, and the options only go up to 100 cm (option H). Wait, 180,000 what? Oh, wait, units are important here.

Wait, the prism's resolving power is R_p = (n-1) * b, where b is in mm. Wait, no, let me check the units. The resolving power R is dimensionless, so if b is in cm, then (n-1) must be unitless, so R_p would be unitless. So if R_p = 90,000, then (n-1)*b = 90,000. If n is 1.5, then (0.5)*b = 90,000 → b = 180,000 mm, which is 1800 meters. That's way too big, so I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I have the formula wrong. Another source says that the resolving power of a prism is R_p = (n - 1) * L, where L is the length of the base in cm. So if the resolving power is 90,000, then (n-1) * L = 90,000. If we take n=1.5, then (0.5)*L = 90,000 → L = 180,000 cm, which is 1800 meters. That can't be right. So maybe I'm using the wrong formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the resolving power of a prism is given by R = (n - 1) * (length in cm). If the prism's resolving power is to equal the grating's 90,000, then (n - 1) * length (cm) = 90,000. Let's assume n=1.5, then 0.5 * length = 90,000 → length = 180,000 cm, which is 1800 meters. That's impossible, so perhaps the formula is different.

Wait, maybe the formula for resolving power of a prism is R = (n - 1) * (diameter in mm) * 1000, or something else. Alternatively, perhaps I'm confusing the formula with that of a grating. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the resolving power of a prism is R = (n - 1) * L, where L is the length in meters. Wait, no, that would give a huge number. Maybe it's R = (n - 1) * L (in mm). So if R is 90,000, then (n-1)*L (mm) = 90,000. For n=1.5, L = 90,000 / 0.5 = 180,000 mm = 180 meters. Still too big.

Wait, perhaps I'm using the wrong formula. Maybe for a prism, the resolving power is given by R = (n - 1) * b, where b is the base length in cm. So R = (n-1)*b. If we set R = 90,000, and take n=1.5, then 0.5 * b = 90,000 → b=180,000 cm, which is 1800 meters. That's way too large, so perhaps the formula is R = (n - 1) * b / λ, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed so that the prism's width (c) is in cm, and the formula is R_prism = (n - 1) * width (cm). So if the grating's R is 90,000, then (n-1)*width = 90,000. Assuming n=1.5, width= 90,000 / 0.5 = 180,000 cm = 1800 meters. That can't be right, so perhaps the formula is different.

Wait, maybe the resolving power of a prism is R = (n - 1) * (width in mm) * 1000, but that would be (n-1)*W, where W is in mm. So (n-1)*W (mm) = 90,000 → W = 90,000 / (n-1). With n=1.5, W= 90,000 / 0.5 = 180,000 mm = 180 meters. Still too big.

Wait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me look for an alternative approach. The resolving power of a grating is R = n * D, where n is lines/mm and D is the width in mm. For a prism, perhaps the resolving power is R = (n_prism - 1) * length_prism, where length_prism is in cm. So if we set R_grating = R_prism, then 90,000 = (n_prism -1) * length_prism (cm).

Assuming n_prism is around 1.5, then 0.5 * length = 90,000 → length = 180,000 cm = 1800 meters. That's impossible, so perhaps the formula is different.

Wait, maybe the formula is R = (n -1) * (length in meters) * 100. Let me try that. If R = 90,000, then (n-1)*L (m) *100 = 90,000 → (n-1)*L (m) = 900. So for n=1.5, L=900 / 0.5 = 1800 meters. Still too big.

I must be missing something here. Maybe the formula for the prism's resolving power is different. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects us to equate the angular dispersion of the grating and the prism.

Wait, the angular dispersion (dθ/dλ) of a grating is given by dθ/dλ = (d)/(mλ), where d is the spacing between lines, m is the order, and λ is the wavelength. For maximum dispersion, m=1, so dθ/dλ = d/λ.

For a prism, the angular dispersion is given by dθ/dλ = (n - 1) * (sin A)/A, where A is the apex angle. But this is getting complicated, and I don't have the values for A or n.

Alternatively, perhaps the resolving power of a prism is given by R = (n -1) * length, where length is in cm. So if R = 90,000, and (n-1) is 0.5, then length = 90,000 / 0.5 = 180,000 cm = 1800 meters. But that's not an option available. The options for part (c) are up to 100 cm. So perhaps I'm using the wrong approach.

Wait, maybe the prism's resolving power is R = (n -1) * width (in mm) * something. Alternatively, perhaps the prism's width is to be found in mm, and the formula is R = (n-1) * width (mm). So 90,000 = 0.5 * width → width = 180,000 mm = 1800 meters. Still no.

Hmm, this is getting frustrating. Maybe I should approach this differently. Let's look at the options. The options for part (c) are 95 cm (A), 60 cm (B), 65 cm (C), 100 cm (D), 75 cm (E), 55 cm (F), 85 cm (G), 90 cm (H), 80 cm (I), 70 cm (J).

Earlier, I thought part (a) is 90,000 (option E), part (b) is 0.06 (option E), and part (c) is something else. But the part (c) values in the options don't match with the calculations I'm getting, which suggests I'm making a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the formula for the prism's resolving power is R = (n -1) * (length in cm) * 1000. So if R=90,000, then (n-1)*length (cm)*1000 = 90,000 → (n-1)*length (cm) = 90.

Assuming n=1.5, then 0.5 * length = 90 → length=180 cm. But that's 1.8 meters, which isn't among the options. So maybe n is different. Let's say n=1.6, then 0.6 * length =90 → length=150 cm. Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is R = (n -1) * (length in mm). So 90,000 = (n-1)*length (mm). If n=1.5, then 0.5 * length =90,000 → length=180,000 mm = 180 meters. No.

Wait, maybe the formula uses the base length in meters. So R = (n-1) * length (m). Then 90,000 = (n-1)*length (m). For n=1.5, length=90,000 /0.5 = 180,000 m, which is 180 km. Impossible.

I'm stuck. Perhaps I should look for another approach. Maybe the resolving power of a prism is given by R = (n -1) * L, where L is in cm, and R is the same as the grating's R=90,000. So (n-1)*L =90,000. Assuming n=1.5, L=90,000 / 0.5 = 180,000 cm = 1800 meters. Not possible. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is R = (n -1) * (length in mm) * something else. Maybe I should think about the prism's resolving power in terms of the number of fringes or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the prism's resolving power is R = (n -1) * (base length in cm) * 1000. So R= (n-1)* L *1000. So L = R / [(n-1)*1000]. If R=90,000, and n=1.5, then L= 90,000 / (0.5 * 1000) )= 90,000 / 500= 180 cm. Still not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps the formula is R = (n-1) * (base length in cm) * 100. So L = 90,000 / [ (n-1)*100 ]. For n=1.5, L= 90,000/(0.5 *100) )= 90,000 /50 = 1800 cm=18 meters. Still too big.

I'm clearly missing something here. Maybe the formula for the prism's resolving power is different. Let me think again. Another approach: The resolving power of a prism is given by R = (n -1) * b, where b is the base length in cm. So if R=90,000 and (n-1)=0.5, then b=90,000 /0.5=180,000 cm=1800 meters. That's way too big, so perhaps the formula isn't correct. Maybe the prism's resolving power is R = (n-1) * b / λ, but without λ, that's not helpful.

Wait, maybe the problem is using a different approach where the prism's resolving power is R = (n-1) * width, and for the same R as the grating, which is 90,000, we can calculate the width. But again, without knowing n, it's impossible. So perhaps the problem assumes a standard n, like n=1.6, which is typical for some glass. Let's try n=1.6. Then (n-1)=0.6. So R=0.6 * width (cm) =90,000 → width=90,000 /0.6=150,000 cm=1500 meters. Still too big.

I'm clearly stuck on part (c). Maybe I should look at the options. Option E has part (c) as 75 cm. So if I plug in width=75 cm, and n=1.5, R=(0.5)*75=37.5, which is way less than 90,000. Not matching. Option H has part (c) as 90 cm. So R=0.5 *90=45, still way too low. Option I: 80 cm → 40. Option J:70 cm →35.

Wait, perhaps I'm using the wrong formula. Maybe the resolving power of the prism is R = (n-1) * (width in meters). So R = (1.5 -1) * width (m) = 0.5 * width (m). So to get R=90,000, width=90,000 /0.5=180,000 meters=180 km. Impossible.

Wait, maybe the formula is R = (n-1) * (width in mm) * 1000. So R=0.5 * width (mm) *1000. To get R=90,000, 0.5 * width *1000=90,000 → width=90,000 / (0.5*1000)= 90,000/500=180 mm=18 cm. So width is 18 cm. But that's not one of the options. The closest is option F:55 cm? No, not close.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the grating's resolving power being R = n * D, where D is in mm. For the prism, perhaps R = (n-1) * D_prism (in cm). So setting R_grat = R_prism:

n_grat * D_grat = (n_prism -1) * D_prism.

Given n_grat=600 lines/mm, D_grat=150 mm=15 cm. So R_grat=600 *150=90,000.

So 90,000 = (n_p -1) * D_p (cm).

Assuming n_p=1.5, then D_p = 90,000 / 0.5 = 180,000 cm=1800 meters. Not possible.

Hmm, maybe the prism's D is in mm. So D_p (mm) = 90,000 /0.5=180,000 mm=180 meters. Still too big.

Alternatively, perhaps the prism's D is in cm, so D_p = 90,000 /0.5=180,000 cm=1800 meters. Not possible.

I'm really stuck here. Maybe I should look for another approach. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different formula, such as the resolving power of a prism is R = (n-1) * L, where L is the length in mm. So L = R / (n-1). For R=90,000 and n=1.5, L=90,000/0.5=180,000 mm=180 meters. Still no.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects us to equate the dispersive power, not the resolving power. The dispersive power is the angular dispersion, which for a grating is dθ/dλ = 1/(n m λ), and for a prism, it's dθ/dλ = (n-1)/λ. Setting them equal: (n-1)/λ = 1/(n m λ), so (n-1) = 1/(n m). But without knowing m or n, I can't proceed. This seems complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different approach. Maybe the width of the prism is such that the same number of fringes are produced, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the prism's width is just the same as the grating's width. But the grating's width is 15 cm, and option E's part (c) is 75 cm. That doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps the resolving power of the prism is R = (n -1) * width (in cm), and to match the grating's R=90,000, we have (n-1)*width =90,000. Assuming n=1.5, width=180,000 cm=1800 meters. Not possible.

I think I'm stuck here. Maybe I should look for an option where part (c) is 75 cm, which is option E. But earlier, part (a)=90,000 and part (b)=0.06, which matches option E. So perhaps despite the confusion with part (c), the correct answer is E. But I'm not sure about part (c). Alternatively, perhaps the prism's width is 75 cm, and the formula is R = (n-1)*width (cm). So 0.5 *75=37.5, which is way less than 90,000. So that can't be right. Therefore, perhaps the correct answer is E for parts (a) and (b), but part (c) is wrong. But since all three parts must match, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the prism's resolving power is R = (n-1)*width (in meters). So if width is 75 cm=0.75 meters, then R=0.5 *0.75=0.375, which is way too small. So that's not it.

I think I'm stuck, but given that parts (a) and (b) of option E match, I'll proceed with E as the answer, assuming that part (c) is correct in the options.
</think>

The problem involves determining the resolution of a grating, the minimum separation between two green lines it can resolve, and the width of a glass prism needed to achieve the same resolution. 

### Part (a): Resolution of the Grating
The resolution \( R \) of a grating is given by \( R = n \cdot D \), where \( n \) is the number of lines per mm and \( D \) is the width in mm.  
- \( n = 600 \, \text{lines/mm} \)  
- \( D = 15 \, \text{cm} = 150 \, \text{mm} \)  
- \( R = 600 \cdot 150 = 90,000 \)  

Thus, the resolution is \( 90,000 \), which matches option **E** for part (a).

### Part (b): Minimum Separation Between Two Green Lines
The resolving power \( R \) is related to the minimum wavelength difference \( \delta\lambda \) by \( R = \lambda / \delta\lambda \). Assuming a typical green wavelength \( \lambda = 5000 \, \AA \):  
- \( \delta\lambda = \lambda / R = 5000 / 90,000 \approx 0.0556 \, \AA \), which rounds to \( 0.06 \, \AA \).  

This matches option **E** for part (b).

### Part (c): Width of a Glass Prism for Same Resolution
The resolving power of a prism is given by \( R = (n - 1) \cdot b \), where \( n \) is the refractive index and \( b \) is the base width in cm. Assuming \( n = 1.5 \):  
- \( R = 90,000 = 0.5 \cdot b \)  
- \( b = 90,000 / 0.5 = 180,000 \, \text{cm} = 1800 \, \text{m} \), which is unreasonably large.  

Given the options, none match this result. However, based on parts (a) and (b) matching option **E**, and assuming the problem's constraints, **E** is selected.

### Final Answer:
**E**
