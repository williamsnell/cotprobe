Question:

A woman was hit in the right eye by a shard of glass when her car was rear-ended by an industrial truck. She was hospitalized, lost her eye, and had several operations over several years. She could not return to work as an apprentice ballet dancer due to loss of coordination, constant headaches, and severe disfigurement. She is considered totally disabled. She had been training for the ballet for many years and, at the trial against the tortfeasor, she proved that she was considered a bright and uncoming student. The defendant claimed that this was still too speculative whether she would have been successful. The trial court disagreed and allowed evidence on the lost earning capacity of a ballet dancer. The jury awarded $3 million. Will the appellate court likely reverse the verdict due to the lost earning capacity issue?

Options:

A: Yes, because the damages awarded are excessive and not substantiated by concrete proof of earning capacity.
B: Yes, because the plaintiff failed to prove that she would have definitely become a successful professional ballet dancer.
C: Yes, because the defendant has the right to challenge the amount of the award given by the jury.
D: Yes, the evidence did not guarantee or assure anyone that she really would have been a successful professional ballet dancer.
E: No, the jury's award is discretionary and inviolate, and it may not be disturbed with respect to personal injury damages.
F: Yes, she can only collect for lost work that she held prior to the accident; her future lost earning capacity could be based on an apprentice ballet dancer.
G: No, because some imprecision in the evidence regarding loss of earning capacity is to be expected and is not grounds for excluding the evidence.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this legal question about whether the appellate court will reverse the verdict because of the lost earning capacity issue. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the scenario: A woman was hit in the right eye by glass when her car was rear-ended by an industrial truck. She lost her eye, had multiple operations, couldn't return to work as an apprentice ballet dancer because of coordination issues, headaches, and disfigurement. She's considered totally disabled. She was training to be a ballet dancer for many years and at the trial, she proved she was a bright and upcoming student. The defendant argued that her potential success wasn't certain, but the trial court allowed evidence on her lost earning capacity as a ballet dancer, and the jury awarded $3 million.

Now, the question is whether the appellate court is likely to reverse the verdict because of the lost earning capacity issue.

Looking at the options, I need to determine which one is correct.

I remember that in tort law, when calculating damages for personal injuries, especially loss of earning capacity, the plaintiff needs to show what they would have earned in the future had the injury not occurred. But there's a standard that the proof doesn't have to be exact, but it should be based on reasonable probabilities, not speculation.

In this case, the woman was an apprentice ballet dancer, which is a step towards becoming a professional. She had been training for many years and was described as bright and upcoming. The defendant argued that her potential success wasn't definite, but the trial court allowed the evidence anyway.

So, the issue is whether the evidence of lost earning capacity was properly admitted. The defendant's argument is that it's too speculative because she might not have become a successful professional. But the trial court disagreed.

I think the key here is whether the evidence was sufficient to support the award. The appellate court would look at whether the trial court correctly admitted the evidence and whether the jury's award was reasonable.

Option A says the damages are excessive and not supported by proof. But I'm not sure if $3 million is excessive without knowing the specifics of her potential earnings. Option B says she didn't prove she would definitely be successful. But in tort cases, you don't need to prove certainty, just reasonable probability. So the trial court might have been correct in allowing the evidence because she was a promising student. Option D says the evidence didn't guarantee success, which is similar to B. Option E says the jury's award is discretionary and can't be disturbed, which is a common principle but might not apply if the evidence was improperly admitted. Option G says some imprecision is expected and doesn't warrant excluding evidence, which aligns with the idea that exact proof isn't needed.

So, the appellate court is considering whether the trial court properly admitted evidence of lost earning capacity. Since she was an apprentice, her potential earnings as a professional are relevant, even if uncertain. The defendant's argument that it's too speculative might have some merit, but courts generally allow such evidence if it's based on reasonable expectations.

Looking at the options again, option G says that some imprecision is expected and doesn't grounds for excluding the evidence. That seems correct because the law doesn't require exact proof, just that it's not purely speculative. So the appellate court would likely affirm the decision, not reverse it on this basis.

The appellate court is unlikely to reverse the verdict due to the lost earning capacity issue because courts generally allow evidence of future earnings based on reasonable probabilities, even if there is some uncertainty. The plaintiff demonstrated she was a bright and upcoming apprentice ballet dancer, which provides a reasonable basis for estimating her potential earnings. While the defendant argued the evidence was speculative, the trial court correctly admitted it, as some imprecision is expected and does not warrant exclusion. Therefore, the appellate court is likely to affirm the jury's award.

Answer: G
