Alright, so I've got this multiple-choice question to tackle. Let me read it carefully and break it down.

The question is about aligning the interests of shareholders and senior management. The idea is that certain incentives are given to certain groups to make sure they work towards increasing specific company metrics. The sentence structure is a bit tricky, but I think I get it.

The question says: "In order to try and align the interest of shareholders and senior management of a company, _________ are often made available to _______ of a company, to ensure that it is in their interests to increase _______ and dividend performance."

So, the blanks are looking for three things: what incentives, who they're given to, and what they aim to increase.

Looking at the options, I need to figure out which one fits best. Let's start by recalling some concepts. I remember that companies often use stock options or performance bonuses to tie executive pay to company performance. This is to ensure that managers have a vested interest in the company's success.

First blank: What are the incentives? Options include performance bonuses, non-financial remuneration, share options. Performance bonuses are typically tied to achieving certain performance metrics, which would affect profits. Share options (like stock options) give the recipient the right to buy shares at a certain price, encouraging them to increase the share price. Non-financial remuneration might include things like benefits or perks, which aren't directly tied to performance metrics in the same way.

Second blank: Who receives these incentives? Options are shareholders, board of directors, senior managers, all employees, etc. Shareholders are the owners, but the question is about aligning with senior management. So it's more about giving incentives to senior managers, not shareholders themselves.

Third blank: What do these incentives aim to increase? Options include company's market cap, employee satisfaction, company profit, share price. Share price is directly related to the value of the company and dividends. If senior managers have stock options, their personal gain is tied to the share price going up, which would align their interests with shareholders.

Now, let's look at the options:

Option F: Performance bonuses, Senior managers, Company Profit. That makes sense because performance bonuses tied to profit would align managers' interests with company profits, which in turn affects shareholder value. But I'm not sure if performance bonuses are the most common method used for this alignment. I think stock options are more commonly associated with this strategy.

Option H: Share options, Senior managers, Share Price. This also sounds correct because share options would make senior managers want the share price to rise, which is good for both them and the shareholders.

Option J: Share options, Shareholders, Share Price. But the question is about aligning senior management with shareholders, so giving options to shareholders wouldn't directly affect management's incentives. Instead, giving options to management would do that.

Option F's third blank is company profit, which is also important. But the question mentions "dividend performance," which is more directly tied to share price and how the company is valued.

So, the question is about ensuring that both shareholders and senior management are incentivized to increase share price and dividend performance. Share options given to senior managers would do that because their gains are tied to the share price. If the share price goes up, their options become more valuable, and dividends would also increase if the company is performing well.

Looking again at the options, H is Share options, Senior managers, Share Price. That seems to fit. The first blank is share options, second is senior managers, and the third is share price, which ties into both the company's value and the dividends.

Wait, but the question also mentions "dividend performance." Dividends are directly related to the share price because higher dividends can lead to higher share prices. So aligning on share price would also impact dividend performance.

Another point: Performance bonuses (like option F) might be more about short-term profits, whereas share options encourage longer-term growth, which affects the share price and dividends over time.

So, putting it all together, the correct answer is likely H: Share options, Senior managers, Share Price.

The question focuses on aligning the interests of shareholders and senior management by providing incentives that encourage both to prioritize increasing the share price and dividend performance. The correct answer must identify the right incentives, who they are given to, and the desired outcome.

- **Incentives**: Share options are commonly used because they tie the value of the incentive directly to the share price, ensuring that senior managers have a vested interest in the company's performance.
- **Recipients**: Senior managers are the key group here, as the goal is to align their interests with those of shareholders.
- **Outcome**: The share price is the primary metric affected by these incentives, as it directly impacts both the value of the company and the dividends paid to shareholders.

Given these considerations, the correct answer is:

H: Share options, Senior managers, Share Price

Answer: H
