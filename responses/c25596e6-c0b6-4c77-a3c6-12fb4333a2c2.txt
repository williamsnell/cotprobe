Okay, so I've got this problem about a car traveling at different speeds over three segments, each 20 miles long. I need to find the average speed for the entire trip. Hmm, average speed can be tricky because it's not just the average of the speeds; it's total distance divided by total time. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the car goes 20 miles at 30 mph. To find the time taken for each segment, I can use the formula time = distance/speed. So for the first part, time is 20 miles divided by 30 mph. Let me calculate that: 20/30 is 2/3 hours, which is about 40 minutes.

Next, it goes another 20 miles at 40 mph. Using the same formula, time is 20/40, which is 0.5 hours or 30 minutes. So far, two segments done, each taking 40 and 30 minutes respectively.

Then, the last 20 miles are at 50 mph. Time here is 20/50, which equals 0.4 hours. To convert that to minutes, 0.4 times 60 is 24 minutes. 

Now, I need to add up all the times to get the total time. Let's see: 2/3 hours is approximately 0.6667 hours, plus 0.5 hours is 1.1667 hours, plus 0.4 hours brings the total to 1.5667 hours. Wait, let me check that again. 2/3 is about 0.6667, plus 0.5 is 1.1667, then plus 0.4 is 1.5667 hours total.

The total distance is 20 + 20 + 20, which is 60 miles. So average speed is total distance divided by total time. That's 60 miles divided by 1.5667 hours. Let me calculate that: 60 รท 1.5667 is approximately 38.2 mph. 

Wait, but let me do it more accurately. 2/3 + 1/2 + 2/5. Let me convert these fractions to have a common denominator. The denominators are 3, 2, and 5. The least common multiple is 30. So, 2/3 is 20/30, 1/2 is 15/30, and 2/5 is 12/30. Adding them together: 20 +15 +12 =47/30 hours. So total time is 47/30 hours, which is approximately 1.5667 hours.

Total distance is 60 miles. So average speed is 60 divided by (47/30). Dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal. So 60 * (30/47) = (60*30)/47. 60*30 is 1800, so 1800/47. Let me calculate that: 47*38 is 1786, and 47*38.3 is about 1799.1. So 1800/47 is approximately 38.3 mph. 

Looking at the options, I see option I is 38.2 mph, which is close. So the correct answer should be I.

The average speed is calculated by dividing the total distance by the total time. Each segment's time is calculated by dividing distance by speed. Summing these times gives the total time. Dividing the total distance (60 miles) by this total time yields the average speed of approximately 38.2 mph.

Answer: I
