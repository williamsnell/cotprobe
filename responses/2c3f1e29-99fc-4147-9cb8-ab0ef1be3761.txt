Okay, let me try to work through this question step by step. So, the question is about the statement of cash flows, specifically the indirect method used by Zokro, a non-governmental not-for-profit organization. They're asking which item must be added back to the change in net assets when determining net cash provided (used) by operating activities.

First, I remember that the indirect method starts with net income (or net assets for non-profits) and adjusts it for non-cash items and changes in working capital to arrive at net cash flow from operating activities. So, the formula is usually Net Cash Flow = Net Income + Non-cash charges ± changes in working capital accounts.

Looking at the options, I need to figure out which of these would be added back. Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: Sale of equipment. Wait, the sale of equipment would be a cash inflow from investing activities, not operating. So when using the indirect method, we wouldn't include this in the operating section. Instead, it's reported elsewhere.

Option B: Depreciation. Depreciation is a non-cash expense. Since it's subtracted in the financial statements, we need to add it back to the change in net assets when calculating cash flow. So B seems like a candidate.

Option C: Increase in accounts payable. An increase in accounts payable means the organization owes more money, which is a use of cash. But wait, when using the indirect method, if accounts payable increases, that's a source of cash because it's like the organization hasn't paid yet. So in the cash flow statement, an increase in accounts payable would be added back because it's a working capital increase. Hmm, so C might be added.

Option D: Increase in accounts receivable. This is the opposite. If accounts receivable increases, it means the organization has more money owed to it, which is a use of cash. So in the cash flow, we would subtract this because it's a decrease in cash. Therefore, D would not be added back.

Option E: Decrease in accounts payable. If accounts payable decreases, the organization has paid more, which is a cash outflow. So this would not be added back; instead, it's subtracted.

Option F: Donation income. Donation income is a revenue item, which is part of net income. Since net income is already considered, and this is a cash inflow, I don't think we add it again. It's already included in the net assets.

Option G: Purchase of inventory. Purchasing inventory is a cash outflow from operating activities. But in the indirect method, we adjust for changes in inventory, not the purchase itself. So I don't think this is added back; it's part of cost of goods sold, which would have been adjusted elsewhere.

Option H: Payment of dividends. Dividends are a cash outflow from financing activities, so they're not part of the operating section. So H isn't added back here.

Option I: Payment on long-term debt. Again, this is a financing activity, so it's not part of the operating cash flow calculation. So I isn't added.

Option J: Purchase of equipment. This is a cash outflow from investing activities, so it's not included in the operating section. So J isn't added back.

Wait, so the question is about what must be added back. So looking again, both B and C are possibilities. Depreciation is definitely added back because it's a non-cash charge. But also, an increase in accounts payable is an increase in a liability, which is a source of cash, so it's added back as well.

But the question is asking which one is added back. Hmm, but the options are individual, so the question is which one of these from A to J must be added.

Wait, the question says "must add back which of the following". So in the context of the indirect method, when you start with net change in net assets, you adjust for things like non-cash items and changes in working capital. So both depreciation (non-cash) and changes in accounts payable (working capital) would be added back.

But the options are separate, so the question is which one is correct. The options are separate, so perhaps I need to pick all that apply, but since it's multiple choice, only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps the question is only looking for the non-cash item. Because when you use the indirect method, you start with net income and add back non-cash expenses like depreciation, amortization, etc., and then adjust for changes in working capital.

So in the case of the non-profit, they use change in net assets instead of net income. So the process is similar. So they start with the change in net assets and add back non-cash items and adjust for working capital changes.

So, looking at the options, both B and C are items that would be added back. But the options are separate, so perhaps each answer is a single letter.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me list which items are added back in the indirect method.

In the indirect method:

- You start with net income (or change in net assets for non-profits).
- Add back non-cash expenses (like depreciation).
- Adjust for changes in working capital accounts:
   - Increase in accounts receivable: subtract (because it's a use of cash)
   - Decrease in accounts receivable: add (source of cash)
   - Increase in accounts payable: add (source of cash)
   - Decrease in accounts payable: subtract (use of cash)
   - Similarly for other working capital items like inventory.

So, in this question, they're asking which of the following must be added back. So both B (depreciation) and C (increase in accounts payable) would be added back. But looking at the options, each is a separate choice.

Wait, but the question says "must add back which of the following", so perhaps more than one is correct, but since it's a multiple-choice question, only one is the correct answer.

Wait, perhaps the question is only considering non-cash items. Because in the indirect method, you add back non-cash items and then adjust for changes in working capital.

Alternatively, maybe the question is specifically about non-cash items only, so only B would be added back.

Wait, but the options include both B and C. So perhaps both are correct, but the question is which one is correct.

Wait, the question says "must add back which of the following". So perhaps the correct answer is both B and C, but since the options are separate, perhaps the correct choices are B and C. But the options are given as A to J, each a single option.

Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

The question is: "In determining its net cash provided (used) by operating activities, Sokro must add back which of the following to the change in net assets?"

So the change in net assets is the starting point. Then, to compute cash flow from operations, you add back non-cash items and adjust for working capital changes.

So, for example:

Net cash flow from operations = Change in net assets + non-cash items ± changes in working capital.

So, looking at the options, both B (depreciation) and C (increase in accounts payable) would be added back.

But the options are separate. So perhaps the question is only referring to non-cash items, so B is the correct answer. Because the changes in working capital are adjustments, but the question is about adding back to the change in net assets.

Wait, maybe the wording is different. Let me check the exact wording again.

The question says: "add back which of the following to the change in net assets?"

So, the change in net assets (which is similar to net income for a non-profit) is the starting point. Then, you add back non-cash items like depreciation and amortization, and adjust for changes in working capital.

So, when you add back to the change in net assets, you're including non-cash expenses, and then adjusting for changes in working capital.

So, for example, if accounts payable increases, that's an addition to the change in net assets because it's a source of cash.

So, both B and C would be added back.

But looking at the options, each is a separate choice. So perhaps the correct answer is both B and C. But the options are separate, so perhaps the question expects only one correct answer.

Wait, perhaps the question is only considering non-cash items, so the answer is B: Depreciation.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the fact that when using the indirect method, you add back non-cash items, and then adjust for changes in working capital. But the question is about what must be added back, so both B and C would be correct, but since the options are separate, perhaps the intended answer is B.

Wait, but the options are singular, so perhaps the answer expects both, but the options don't include both. Alternatively, perhaps the question is only about non-cash items, so the correct answer is B.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is both B and C, but as separate options, perhaps the question is designed to have multiple correct answers, but in this case, it's a single-choice question.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the process again. The statement of cash flows, indirect method:

Net cash flow from operating activities = Net income + non-cash expenses ± changes in working capital.

In this case, for a non-profit, it's change in net assets + non-cash items ± changes in working capital.

So, looking at the options:

A: Sale of equipment – investing, not added.

B: Depreciation – non-cash, added.

C: Increase in accounts payable – added because it's a source of cash.

D: Increase in accounts receivable – subtracted.

E: Decrease in accounts payable – subtracted.

F: Donation income – part of net assets, already included.

G: Purchase of inventory – part of COGS, already included.

H: Payment of dividends – financing, not added.

I: Payment on long-term debt – financing, not added.

J: Purchase of equipment – investing, not added.

So, both B and C would be added back. But in the options, only B and C are present. Since the options are separate, perhaps the question expects both, but the options don't have a combined choice.

Wait, perhaps the question is only asking about non-cash items, so the answer is B.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is both B and C, but the options don't allow that. Hmm.

Wait, the question says "must add back which of the following to the change in net assets?"

So, in the process, you add back both non-cash items and changes in working capital that are sources of cash.

So, in this case, options B and C are both correct. But the options are given as separate letters, so perhaps the intended answer is both. However, since the options are individual, perhaps the question is only referring to non-cash items, which is B.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is designed to have multiple correct answers, but it's a single-choice. Maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is B and C, but since the options are separate, perhaps the correct choice is both B and C, but since the options are separate, I might have to choose each separately.

But the way the question is phrased, it's "must add back which of the following", meaning all that apply. But in the given options, perhaps the correct answers are B and C.

But looking at the options, the letters are A to J, each a single option. So perhaps the intended answer is B, because it's a non-cash item that must be added back.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is only about non-cash items, so the correct answer is B.

Wait, but the question includes both B and C as options. So perhaps the correct answer includes both, but since it's a single-choice, maybe the intended answer is B.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the standard process.

In the indirect method, after starting with net income (or change in net assets), you add back non-cash items like depreciation, then adjust for increases in accounts receivable (subtract) and increases in accounts payable (add). So both B and C are added back.

But since the options are separate, perhaps the correct answer includes both B and C, but the question expects only one.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is only about non-cash items, so the correct answer is B.

But the question includes both, so perhaps the correct answer is both B and C. But since the options are separate, perhaps the intended answer is both, but the system expects one letter.

Wait, perhaps the answer is B and C, but the options don't allow that. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is B.

Wait, perhaps the answer is B: Depreciation and C: Increase in accounts payable.

But the options are separate, so perhaps the correct answer is both B and C. But since the question is multiple-choice with one correct answer, perhaps I need to think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is C, because when net assets change, you adjust for changes in accounts payable.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to think of an example.

Suppose net assets increased by $100. Then, depreciation is $20 (non-cash), so you add that back. Also, if accounts payable increased by $10, that's a source of cash, so you add that back as well.

So, net cash flow would be $100 + $20 + $10 = $130.

So both B and C are added back.

But the options are separate, so perhaps the correct answer includes both. But since the options are separate, perhaps the question expects both, but the answer is both B and C.

But the way the question is phrased, perhaps it's looking for all that apply, but the options are single letters. So perhaps the correct answer is both B and C.

But the options are from A to J, so perhaps the correct answer is both B and C, but the system expects one letter. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the answer is B and C, but since the user is to select one letter, perhaps the correct answer is both, but the options don't allow that. Alternatively, perhaps the question is only about non-cash items, so the answer is B.

I think I need to make a decision. Based on standard accounting practice, both B and C are added back. But since the options are separate, perhaps the intended answer is B, as it's a non-cash item, and C is a working capital adjustment.

But the question is about what must be added back. So both are correct. However, perhaps the answer expects both. But since it's a single-choice, perhaps the correct answer is B.

Wait, perhaps the question is only about non-cash items, so the answer is B: Depreciation.

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps both B and C are correct, but the options don't allow for that. So perhaps the intended answer is B.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is B and C, but the options are separate. So perhaps the answer is both, but the system expects one letter. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is B: Depreciation.

Because in the indirect method, you add back non-cash items like depreciation, and then adjust for changes in working capital. So the question is about adding back to the change in net assets, which includes both non-cash and working capital changes.

So, the correct answer would include both B and C. But since the options are separate, perhaps the intended answer is both, but the question expects one letter. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is B and C, but since the options are separate, perhaps the question is designed to have multiple correct answers, but it's a single-choice. I'm a bit stuck.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the answer in a textbook or online. In the indirect method, when calculating operating cash flow, you add back depreciation and amortization, and then adjust for increases in accounts payable (add) and decreases (subtract), same with accounts receivable.

So, in the given options, both B and C are correct. But since the options are separate, perhaps the correct answer is both B and C, but the question expects one letter. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the answer is B: Depreciation and C: Increase in accounts payable.

But the options are separate, so perhaps the correct answer is both, but the question expects one letter. I think I might have to go with B as the primary answer, as it's a non-cash item, and C is a working capital adjustment.

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is both B and C.

But since the question is asking which must be added back, and both are correct, but the options are separate, perhaps the answer is both B and C, but the options don't have a combined choice. So perhaps the intended answer is B.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is both B and C, but the options are separate. So perhaps the answer is both, but the system expects one letter. I think I'll have to go with B and C, but since I can only choose one, perhaps the intended answer is B.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is B and C, but the question expects multiple answers. But the user is asking to select from A to J, so perhaps the answer is both B and C.

But given the options, perhaps the correct answer is B: Depreciation.
</think>

The question asks which item must be added back to the change in net assets when using the indirect method to determine net cash provided (used) by operating activities. The indirect method starts with the change in net assets and adjusts for non-cash items and changes in working capital.

- **Option B (Depreciation)**: Depreciation is a non-cash expense and must be added back to the change in net assets.
- **Option C (Increase in accounts payable)**: An increase in accounts payable is a source of cash and must also be added back.

Both B and C are correct because they are adjustments made in the indirect method. However, since the question requires selecting one option, the primary focus is on non-cash items, making **B: Depreciation** the most direct answer.

Answer: B
