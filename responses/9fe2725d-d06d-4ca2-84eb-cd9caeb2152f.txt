Okay, so I've got this question about backgammon, and I need to figure out how many players it involves. The options are from A to J, with numbers ranging from one to ten. Let me think about what I know about backgammon.

First, I remember that backgammon is a board game. I've seen it played before, maybe in a restaurant or online. From what I recall, it's a game where two players take turns moving their pieces across the board. The goal is to move all your pieces around the board, and then bear them off to win. 

Wait, so that's two players, right? Each has their own set of pieces, usually 15 each, and they move them in opposite directions. The board has 24 points, divided into three sections each, with a home board where you can bear off. The doubling cube is used for betting, but that doesn't change the number of players.

I don't think backgammon is a single-player game because you need an opponent to play against. So D: One is probably wrong. What about options like three or more? I don't think so; I haven't heard of three-player backgammon. Most games I know, like chess or checkers, are two-player. Maybe some games have more, but backgammon is traditionally two.

Let me think again. When I watch people play, it's always two people. They roll the dice together, take turns moving. So yeah, it's definitely a two-player game. That would make the answer C: Two.

The answer is C: Two.
