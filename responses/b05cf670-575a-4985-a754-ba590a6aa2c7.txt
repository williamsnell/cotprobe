Okay, so I've got this problem here about Jim buying a vacuum cleaner, and I need to figure out how much he paid after discounts and taxes. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the vacuum cleaner is priced at $69.75. There's a 5% discount on it. So I think I should calculate the discount amount first and then subtract it from the original price to get the discounted price. 

Calculating the discount: 5% of $69.75. To find 5%, I can multiply 69.75 by 0.05. Let me do that: 69.75 * 0.05 equals... let's see, 69.75 divided by 20, since 5% is 1/20. 69.75 divided by 20 is 3.4875. So the discount is $3.4875. 

Subtracting that from the original price: 69.75 - 3.4875. Let me subtract: 69.75 minus 3 is 66.75, then minus 0.4875 is 66.75 - 0.4875 = 66.2625. So the discounted price is $66.2625. Wait, but sometimes we deal with dollars and cents, so maybe I should round this to the nearest cent, which would be $66.26. Hmm, but let me see if I need to consider this before applying taxes or if I should apply taxes first. Wait, the problem says the discount is applied first, I think. So the discounted price is $66.2625.

Now, there are taxes to apply. There's a state sales tax of 3% and a city sales tax of 4%. Wait, do I add these two taxes together? Or are they applied one after the other? I think taxes are usually applied on the discounted price. So first, I should calculate the total tax rate. Let me add 3% and 4% to get 7%. So the combined tax rate is 7%.

So the tax amount is 7% of the discounted price. The discounted price is $66.2625. Calculating 7% of that: 66.2625 * 0.07. Let me compute that. 66.2625 * 0.07. 66 * 0.07 is 4.62, and 0.2625 * 0.07 is approximately 0.018375. Adding those together: 4.62 + 0.018375 = 4.638375. So the tax is approximately $4.638375.

Now, adding this tax to the discounted price: 66.2625 + 4.638375. Let's add: 66 + 4 is 70, 0.2625 + 0.638375 is 0.900875. So total is $70.900875. Rounding that to the nearest cent would be $70.90.

Wait, but let me double-check the steps. Maybe I made a mistake in the order. Sometimes, discounts are applied before taxes, which I think is correct here. Let me confirm:

1. Original price: $69.75
2. 5% discount: 69.75 * 0.05 = $3.4875 discount
3. Discounted price: 69.75 - 3.4875 = $66.2625
4. Taxes: 3% state + 4% city = 7% total tax
5. Tax amount: 66.2625 * 0.07 = $4.638375
6. Total price: 66.2625 + 4.638375 = $70.900875, which rounds to $70.90.

Looking at the options, option A is $70.90. So that should be the correct answer.

The total amount Jim paid is calculated by first applying the 5% discount to the original price of $69.75, resulting in a discounted price of $66.2625. Then, a combined sales tax of 7% (3% state + 4% city) is applied to this discounted price, adding $4.638375 in taxes. Adding the tax to the discounted price gives a total of $70.90, which corresponds to option A.
