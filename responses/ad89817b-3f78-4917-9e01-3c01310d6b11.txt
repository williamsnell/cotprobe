Question:

On January 17, the shirt buyer for Wellington's Department Store decided to determine his open-to-buy. The following figures were available: Present inventory at retail (Jan 17) Inventory commitments (Jan 17) Planned end-of-month inventory (Jan 31) Planned sales Actual sales Planned markdowns Actual markdowns $12,000 3,000 15,000 6,000 3,000 500 200 What is the buyer's open-to-buy?

Options:

A: $18,300
B: $12,200
C: $5,000
D: $10,800
E: $3,300
F: $2,800
G: $15,000
H: $6,000
I: $7,700

Okay, so I need to figure out the buyer's open-to-buy for Wellington's Department Store. Hmm, I remember that open-to-buy is calculated based on several factors, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I should probably list out the given data to make sure I don't get confused. The figures provided are:

- Present inventory at retail (Jan 17): $12,000
- Inventory commitments (Jan 17): $3,000
- Planned end-of-month inventory (Jan 31): $15,000
- Planned sales: $6,000
- Actual sales: $3,000
- Planned markdowns: $500
- Actual markdowns: $200

I think the formula for open-to-buy involves figuring out how much the buyer can still purchase without exceeding the planned end-of-month inventory. Let me recall the formula. I believe it's something like:

Open-to-Buy = Planned End-of-Month Inventory - (Present Inventory + Inventory Commitments)

But wait, maybe I'm missing something. Oh right, planned sales and actual sales probably play a role too, because the buyer needs to account for how much stock will be sold and adjusted for markdowns.

Let me break it down. The buyer's available funds would come from the sales, but since some markdowns are planned, those would reduce the effective sales. So perhaps I should adjust the sales by the markdowns.

So, Effective Sales = Planned Sales - Actual Markdowns? Or is it Actual Sales plus something? Hmm, maybe I should consider the actual sales and then adjust for markdowns. Wait, no, I think the markdowns are taken from the planned sales. So perhaps the formula is:

Available Funds = Actual Sales - Actual Markdowns

Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Let me think again. Markdowns reduce the revenue, so maybe they affect how much inventory is needed. Alternatively, maybe the markdowns are subtracted from the planned sales to adjust the effective sales.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

Open-to-Buy = (Planned Sales - Actual Sales) + (Planned Markdowns - Actual Markdowns) + (Planned End-of-Month Inventory - (Present Inventory + Inventory Commitments))

No, that seems complicated. Maybe I should think of it as the buyer's available funds minus what's already committed and in inventory.

Wait, I think the standard formula for open-to-buy is:

Open-to-Buy = (Planned Sales - Actual Sales) + (Planned Markdowns - Actual Markdowns) + (Planned End-of-Month Inventory - (Present Inventory + Inventory Commitments))

But I'm not entirely sure. Let me try to think of it differently. The buyer's open-to-buy is the amount they can spend on new purchases without exceeding their planned end-of-month inventory. So, they need to cover their current inventory, their commitments, and adjust for any markdowns and sales.

Alternatively, another approach is:

The buyer's available funds come from the sales and markdowns. So, the funds available are:

Funds Available = Actual Sales - Actual Markdowns

But wait, no, because planned sales and markdowns might be part of the calculation. Maybe it's:

Funds Available = (Planned Sales - Actual Sales) + (Planned Markdowns - Actual Markdowns)

Wait, perhaps that's the case. Because if actual sales are less than planned, the buyer can use the difference to purchase more. Similarly, if actual markdowns are less than planned, that might mean more inventory is needed.

So, Funds Available = (Planned Sales - Actual Sales) + (Planned Markdowns - Actual Markdowns)

Plugging in the numbers:

Planned Sales: 6,000
Actual Sales: 3,000
So, 6,000 - 3,000 = 3,000

Planned Markdowns: 500
Actual Markdowns: 200
So, 500 - 200 = 300

Adding those together: 3,000 + 300 = 3,300

Now, the buyer has $3,300 available to spend. But they also have existing inventory and commitments. So, the total inventory they have is:

Present Inventory: 12,000
Inventory Commitments: 3,000
Total: 15,000

Wait, but the planned end-of-month inventory is 15,000. So, they plan to have 15,000 at the end of the month. So, the amount they can buy is:

Open-to-Buy = Planned End-of-Month Inventory - (Present Inventory + Inventory Commitments)

So, 15,000 - (12,000 + 3,000) = 15,000 - 15,000 = 0

But that can't be right because that would suggest the open-to-buy is zero, which isn't one of the options. So maybe I'm missing the funds available part.

Wait, perhaps the open-to-buy is the funds available plus the current inventory and commitments, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the open-to-buy is calculated as:

Open-to-Buy = (Planned Sales - Actual Sales) + (Planned Markdowns - Actual Markdowns) + (Planned End-of-Month Inventory - (Present Inventory + Inventory Commitments))

Wait, that would be 3,300 (from earlier) + 0 (from the last part) = 3,300. But option E is 3,300. However, I think I might be mixing up the formula.

Let me check another approach. The open-to-buy is the amount the buyer can purchase beyond their current inventory and commitments, considering the funds available from sales and markdowns. So, the formula might be:

Open-to-Buy = (Planned End-of-Month Inventory - (Present Inventory + Inventory Commitments)) + (Planned Sales - Actual Sales) + (Planned Markdowns - Actual Markdowns)

Wait, but that might not be correct. Alternatively, perhaps the open-to-buy is simply the difference between the planned end inventory and the sum of current inventory and commitments, plus the available funds from sales and markdowns.

Wait, maybe it's:

Open-to-Buy = (Planned End-of-Month Inventory - (Present Inventory + Inventory Commitments)) + (Funds Available)

Where Funds Available is (Planned Sales - Actual Sales) + (Planned Markdowns - Actual Markdowns)

So, in this case:

Funds Available = (6,000 - 3,000) + (500 - 200) = 3,000 + 300 = 3,300

Planned End Inventory - (Current Inv + Commitments) = 15,000 - (12,000 + 3,000) = 15,000 -15,000 = 0

So, Open-to-Buy = 0 + 3,300 = 3,300

But that seems a bit off because the buyer's open-to-buy is the amount they can spend, considering they already have inventory and commitments. Alternatively, maybe the open-to-buy is just the difference between the planned end inventory and the sum of current inventory and commitments, adjusted by the funds available.

Wait, perhaps I should think of it this way: The buyer's available funds are the funds they can use to purchase new stock, which comes from the difference between planned and actual sales and markdowns. Then, the open-to-buy is how much they can buy beyond what's already in inventory and commitments.

So, the formula is:

Open-to-Buy = (Planned Sales - Actual Sales) + (Planned Markdowns - Actual Markdowns) + (Planned End-of-Month Inventory - (Present Inventory + Inventory Commitments))

But that would be 3,300 + 0 = 3,300, which is option E.

Alternatively, perhaps the open-to-buy is calculated as:

Open-to-Buy = (Planned Sales - Actual Sales) + (Planned Markdowns - Actual Markdowns) + (Planned End-of-Month Inventory - (Present Inventory + Inventory Commitments))

Which again gives 3,300.

But looking at the options, E is 3,300, so that's an option.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because another approach might be to calculate the difference between the planned end inventory and the sum of current inventory and commitments, then add the available funds. But in this case, that difference is zero, so the open-to-buy would be the available funds, which is 3,300.

So, the answer should be E: $3,300.
</think>

The buyer's open-to-buy is calculated by determining the funds available from sales and markdowns and adjusting for the planned end-of-month inventory, current inventory, and commitments. 

Funds Available = (Planned Sales - Actual Sales) + (Planned Markdowns - Actual Markdowns)  
= (6,000 - 3,000) + (500 - 200)  
= 3,000 + 300  
= 3,300

Planned End-of-Month Inventory = 15,000  
Present Inventory + Inventory Commitments = 12,000 + 3,000 = 15,000  
Difference = 15,000 - 15,000 = 0  

Open-to-Buy = Funds Available + Difference  
= 3,300 + 0  
= 3,300
