Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the smallest positive integer that satisfies three different remainder conditions when divided by 5, 7, and 9. Let me try to break this down step by step. 

First, the problem states that the number leaves a remainder of 3 when divided by 5. So, mathematically, that can be written as:
N ≡ 3 mod 5
Which means when N is divided by 5, the remainder is 3. So possible numbers here would be 3, 8, 13, 18, 23, 28, etc. Basically, numbers that are 3 more than a multiple of 5.

Next, the number also leaves a remainder of 4 when divided by 7. So that's:
N ≡ 4 mod 7
Possible numbers here would be 4, 11, 18, 25, 32, 39, 46, etc. These are numbers that are 4 more than a multiple of 7.

Lastly, the number leaves a remainder of 2 when divided by 9:
N ≡ 2 mod 9
Numbers here would be 2, 11, 20, 29, 38, 47, 56, etc. These are numbers that are 2 more than a multiple of 9.

Now, I need to find the smallest number that appears in all three lists. Since checking each number one by one could take a while, maybe I can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem or some systematic approach to find this number.

Let me list the numbers from each condition and see where they overlap. Alternatively, I can express each condition as an equation and solve them step by step.

Starting with the first condition:
N = 5k + 3, where k is an integer ≥ 0.

Now, this N must also satisfy the second condition:
5k + 3 ≡ 4 mod 7
So, 5k ≡ 1 mod 7 (since 4 - 3 =1)
I can solve for k here. Let's see, 5k ≡1 mod7. The inverse of 5 mod7 is needed. Since 5*3=15≡1 mod7, so inverse is 3.
So, k ≡3*1 ≡3 mod7. So k=7m +3, where m is an integer ≥0.

Substituting back into N:
N=5*(7m+3)+3 =35m +15 +3=35m +18.

Now, this N must also satisfy the third condition:
35m +18 ≡2 mod9.

Let's compute 35m mod9. 35 divided by9 is 3*9=27, remainder 8, so 35≡8 mod9. So,
35m +18 ≡8m + (18 mod9) ≡8m +0 ≡8m mod9.

So, 8m ≡2 mod9.

Now, solving for m: 8m ≡2 mod9.

To solve 8m ≡2 mod9, I can find the inverse of 8 mod9. Since 8 and 9 are coprime, the inverse exists. Let's see, 8*8=64≡1 mod9 (because 64-63=1). So inverse of 8 is 8.

So, m ≡8*2≡16≡7 mod9 (since 16-9=7). So m=9n +7, where n is an integer ≥0.

Now, substituting back into N:
N=35*(9n+7)+18 =35*9n +35*7 +18 =315n +245 +18=315n +263.

So the smallest positive N occurs when n=0, which gives N=263. Let me check the options given to see if 263 is an option. Looking at the options, D is 263. So that's the answer.

But just to be thorough, let me check if 263 satisfies all three conditions.

263 divided by5: 5*52=260, remainder 3. Good.
263 divided by7: 7*37=259, remainder 4. Good.
263 divided by9: 9*29=261, remainder 2. Perfect.

So yes, 263 is the smallest number that satisfies all three conditions.

The smallest positive integer that satisfies all three conditions is 263, which corresponds to option D.
