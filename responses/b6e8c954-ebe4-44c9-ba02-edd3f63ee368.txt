Okay, so I need to answer this multiple-choice question about three contrasting explanations of anxiety. The question gives me options A through J, each listing three theories or models. Let me think through each option carefully.

First, I remember that anxiety can be explained from various psychological perspectives. The main ones I know are psychoanalytic, cognitive, behavioral, social learning, evolutionary, humanistic, and biomedical models, among others. Each perspective offers a different way to understand anxiety.

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: Psychoanalytic theory, social learning theory, and control theory. Hmm. Psychoanalytic is about unconscious conflicts, social learning is about observational learning and environment, and control theory is about perceived control over events. These are different, but do they all explain anxiety? I think control theory relates to anxiety about losing control, yes. So this could be a valid set.

Option B: Cognitive dissonance, behavioral perspective, diathesis-stress. Cognitive dissonance is about conflicting thoughts leading to anxiety. Behavioral perspective would be about learned responses, like classical or operant conditioning. Diathesis-stress is a model where both genetics and environment contribute. These are three different anglesâ€”cognitive, behavioral, and biopsychosocial. That makes sense as contrasting explanations.

Option C: Psychoanalytic, stimulus-response, Maslow's hierarchy. Stimulus-response is part of behaviorism. Maslow's hierarchy is about needs, not directly about anxiety. I'm not sure if Maslow explains anxiety. He focused on motivation, so this might not be the best fit.

Option D: Fight or flight, psychoanalytic, control theory. Fight or flight is a biological response to stress, which can cause anxiety. Psychoanalytic is about unconscious, and control theory about perceived control. These are three different approaches, but fight or flight is a response, not an explanation of anxiety itself. Maybe not the best fit.

Option E: Attachment theory, psychodynamic, behavioral genetics. Attachment theory is about early relationships influencing anxiety. Psychodynamic is similar to psychoanalytic, focusing on the unconscious. Behavioral genetics looks at inherited factors. These are all different, but I'm not sure if all directly explain anxiety. Maybe, but I'm not certain.

Option F: Social learning, existential analysis, biomedical model. Social learning is about learning through observation. Existential is about meaning and freedom causing anxiety. Biomedical is about biological factors. These are diverse, but I'm not sure if they all fit as explanations for anxiety.

Option G: Psychoanalytic neurotic anxiety, stimulus-response, control/helplessness. This seems similar to option A but more specific. Still, I'm not sure if this is the best choice.

Option H: Cognitive-behavioral, humanistic, evolutionary. Cognitive-behavioral is a common approach for anxiety, focusing on thoughts and behaviors. Humanistic is about personal growth and might not directly explain anxiety. Evolutionary psychology looks at anxiety as an adaptive response. These are different but maybe not the best trio.

Option I: Evolutionary psychology, biopsychosocial, fight or flight. Evolutionary explains anxiety as adaptive. Biopsychosocial is a broad model considering all factors. Fight or flight is a stress response. Again, fight or flight is a response, not an explanation.

Option J: Biological, cognitive, existential. These are three major perspectives. Biological looks at brain chemistry, cognitive examines thoughts, existential considers meaning and existence. This seems like a solid trio of contrasting explanations.

Wait, the question asks for three contrasting explanations. Let me think about what each option includes.

Option B includes cognitive dissonance, which is a cognitive theory, the behavioral perspective, which is behavioral, and diathesis-stress, which is more of a biopsychosocial model. So that covers cognitive, behavioral, and biopsychosocial approaches. That's three different angles, making them contrasting.

Option J has biological, cognitive, and existential. These are also three different perspectives. So both B and J look good.

Wait, the question is about anxiety. Let me think about each theory.

Cognitive dissonance theory explains anxiety as the mental discomfort from conflicting beliefs or attitudes. The behavioral perspective would see anxiety as a learned response, perhaps through conditioning. Diathesis-stress model combines genetic predisposition and environmental stressors. So option B covers cognitive, behavioral, and biopsychosocial.

Option J: biological (like neurotransmitters), cognitive (thoughts causing anxiety), existential (anxiety from existence's meaninglessness). These are also distinct.

But the question is about three contrasting explanations. So both B and J fit, but which one is more accurate?

I recall that cognitive dissonance is more about specific situations causing anxiety, while diathesis-stress is a model that includes both nature and nurture. Social learning theory (option A) is about observing others, which is a behavioral approach. Hmm.

Alternatively, option H includes cognitive-behavioral, which is a blend, humanistic which is more about personal growth, and evolutionary which is about adaptation. Maybe not the best trio.

Wait, the question asks for three contrasting explanations. Let me check each option again.

Option B: Cognitive (dissonance), Behavioral, Diathesis-stress (which is a biopsychosocial model). So three different approaches.

Option J: Biological, Cognitive, Existential. Also three different approaches.

Which one is more correct? I think both are correct, but perhaps the question expects the most standard trio.

Wait, the fight or flight response is more of a physiological reaction to stress, not an explanation of anxiety itself. So in option I, fight or flight is included, but it's a response, not an explanation.

So looking again at the options, the best ones seem to be B and J.

Wait, the question says "three contrasting explanations." So which of the options provides three different theories that explain anxiety from different angles.

Option B includes cognitive, behavioral, and biopsychosocial (diathesis-stress). Option J includes biological, cognitive, and existential.

I think both are correct, but the question might be looking for the most comprehensive trio.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is H: Cognitive-behavioral, humanistic, evolutionary. But I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think again. The question is about explanations of anxiety. So psychoanalytic, social learning, and control theory (option A) are three different theories. Psychoanalytic is about unconscious conflicts. Social learning is about learning through observation. Control theory is about the need for control. These all explain anxiety differently.

Option B's cognitive dissonance is a specific cognitive theory, behavioral is learning, and diathesis-stress is a mix. So both A and B are possible.

Wait, but the question is about three contrasting explanations. So perhaps all three in the correct answer are distinct.

I think the best answer is option B: Cognitive dissonance theory, behavioral perspective, and diathesis-stress model. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, another approach: I remember that the fight or flight response is a biological explanation. So if an option includes that, along with others, it might be a good choice. Option I includes evolutionary psychology, which is a form of biological explanation along with fight or flight and biopsychosocial model. But fight or flight is a response, not a theory explaining anxiety.

Alternatively, option J includes biological perspective (which would include fight or flight), cognitive theory, and existential analysis. That seems like a good trio.

Wait, let me think about the fight or flight response. It's part of the biological explanation of anxiety as a stress response. So option I includes evolutionary psychology (which explains anxiety as an adaptive response), biopsychosocial model (which is broad), and fight or flight (the response). But I'm not sure if fight or flight is an explanation of anxiety itself or just a response to stressors.

In that case, perhaps option J is better because it includes biological, cognitive, and existential perspectives, all of which are explanations of anxiety.

Alternatively, option B includes cognitive, behavioral, and biopsychosocial, which are also three distinct approaches.

I think the correct answer is either B or J. Let me check my notes.

Wait, control theory is about perceived control, which relates to anxiety when control is lost. Social learning is about observing others and learning behaviors, which can influence anxiety. Psychoanalytic is about unconscious conflicts. These are three different theories.

Option A: Psychoanalytic, social learning, control theory. These are three different approaches.

Option B: Cognitive dissonance, behavioral, diathesis-stress. Also three different.

I think the answer is either A or B. But the question is about explanations of anxiety. Cognitive dissonance is a theory that can cause anxiety when there's inconsistency. Behavioral perspective would see anxiety as a learned response. Diathesis-stress combines both genetic and environmental factors.

Alternatively, social learning theory (A) is about learning through observation, which can lead to anxiety. Control theory (A) is about the need for control. So A's three are also valid.

I think the correct answer is option B. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps option J is correct because it includes biological, cognitive, and existential perspectives.

Wait, the question says "three contrasting explanations." So perhaps the best trio is one from each major perspective: biological, psychological, and perhaps social or existential.

Option J includes biological, cognitive, and existential, which are three distinct approaches. That might be the intended answer.

But I'm not 100% certain. Another thought: control theory (option A) is about internal control, which relates to anxiety when someone feels they can't control events. Social learning (A) is about learning behaviors, which can influence anxiety. Psychoanalytic (A) is about unconscious thoughts. So A is also a good set.

I think I need to decide between A and B and J.

Wait, the question is in a psychology exam context. The most likely correct answer is option B: Cognitive dissonance theory, behavioral perspective, and diathesis-stress model. Because these represent cognitive, behavioral, and biopsychosocial approaches, which are the major theoretical frameworks in psychology.

Alternatively, option J includes biological, cognitive, and existential, which are also major approaches.

Hmm, this is tricky. Another angle: which options include theories that are directly about anxiety?

Cognitive dissonance is a theory that can explain anxiety. Behavioral perspective is about how behaviors are learned, which can lead to anxiety. Diathesis-stress model explains how both genetic and environmental factors contribute to anxiety.

Option B seems to cover three distinct approaches that specifically address anxiety.

So I think the correct answer is option B.

The question asks for three contrasting explanations of anxiety, and the options provide various combinations of psychological theories and models. To determine the correct answer, each option was analyzed to identify whether the listed theories directly explain anxiety and represent distinct perspectives.

- **Option A** includes psychoanalytic theory (unconscious conflicts), social learning theory (observational learning), and control theory (perceived control). These are three different approaches but do not all directly focus on anxiety.
- **Option B** lists cognitive dissonance theory (cognitive), behavioral perspective (learned responses), and diathesis-stress model (biopsychosocial). These represent cognitive, behavioral, and biopsychosocial approaches, which are comprehensive and directly address anxiety.
- **Option C** includes Maslow's hierarchy of needs, which is more about motivation than anxiety, making it less relevant.
- **Option D** mentions the fight or flight response, which is a physiological reaction rather than an explanation of anxiety itself.
- **Option E** combines attachment theory, psychodynamic explanation, and behavioral genetics, which are valid but not the most direct explanations of anxiety.
- **Option F** includes existential analysis, which focuses on meaning and existence, but this does not directly explain anxiety.
- **Option G** is similar to Option A but more specific, and while valid, it is not the best fit.
- **Option H** includes cognitive-behavioral, humanistic, and evolutionary perspectives, but humanistic theory is less directly related to anxiety.
- **Option I** includes the fight or flight response, which is a reaction rather than an explanation.
- **Option J** lists biological, cognitive, and existential perspectives, which are distinct but may not be as comprehensive as Option B.

After careful consideration, **Option B** is the most appropriate choice because it covers cognitive, behavioral, and biopsychosocial approaches, which are the major theoretical frameworks in psychology and directly address anxiety.

**Answer: B**
