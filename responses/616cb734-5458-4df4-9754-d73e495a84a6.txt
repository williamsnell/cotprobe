Question:

After his 16th birthday, a youth decided to purchase a new sports car from a dealership for the sales price of $36,000. The youth thereafter entered into a written contract with the dealership, which provided that the youth would make monthly payments of $1,000 for three years. During the first year of the contract, the youth made 12 monthly payments totaling $12,000. However, the youth failed to make any payments during the second year of the contract. The dealership repeatedly threatened to sue the youth for the remaining balance that it claimed was due under the contract. Finally, in order to avoid litigation, the youth sent the dealership the following letter:"The car I purchased from you is a real lemon. I have spent a considerable sum of money during the last two years in repair work. I don't believe that the car is worth $36,000, but I am willing to pay you $10,000 if I find ajob in the next month. "The youth had just turned 18 when he sent this letter to the dealership. The day after mailing this letter, the youth was involved in an automobile accident, and the sports car was totally demolished. Following the accident, the youth remained unemployed, and he refused to make any payments to the dealership. At the time of the accident, the sports car was worth $18,000. In this jurisdiction, the age of majority is18 years of age. If the dealership brings suit against the youth for breach of contract, what, if any, is the plaintiff's proper recovery?

Options:

A: $36,000.00
B: $10,000. 00
C: $18,000. 00
D: The cost of repair work the youth has done on the car.
E: $30,000.00
F: Nothing.
G: $12,000.00
H: The cost of the car at the time of purchase minus the payments made so far.
I: $6,000.00

Okay, so I have this contract law question here, and I'm trying to figure out the answer. Let me read through it carefully.

So, the situation is about a youth who bought a sports car for $36,000. He was 16 when he decided to buy it, but he didn't turn 18 until after he sent a letter to the dealership. The contract is for him to make monthly payments of $1,000 for three years. He made 12 payments in the first year, totaling $12,000, but didn't pay anything in the second year. The dealership kept threatening to sue, and then the youth sent a letter saying the car was a lemon, he spent money on repairs, and he's willing to pay $10k if he finds a job. He turned 18 just when he sent this letter.

After that, he had an accident where the car was destroyed, and he's now unemployed and refusing to pay. At the time of the accident, the car was worth $18,000. The question is, if the dealership sues for breach, what can they recover?

Hmm. So first, I need to consider the contract and whether the youth is liable. He was under 18 when he entered the contract, but he turned 18 when he sent the letter. I remember that minors can enter into contracts, but in some cases, they can disaffirm, but once they reach the age of majority, they can ratify the contract. So, when he turned 18, if he ratified it, then it's a valid contract. Did he ratify it?

In the letter, he's offering to pay $10k, which suggests he's acknowledging the contract, maybe ratifying it. So perhaps the contract is now enforceable against him. If he had disaffirmed before turning 18, the dealership might have issues, but since he sent the letter at 18, perhaps he's now bound.

Now, the youth stopped making payments during the second year. So the dealership is suing for breach. What's the proper recovery?

The total contract is $36,000, with monthly payments of $1,000 for 36 months. He paid 12 months, so $12,000, leaving $24,000. But then the car was destroyed in an accident, which is a total loss. The car was worth $18,000 at the time of the accident.

In contract law, when one party breaches, the other can usually recover damages. But in this case, the breach is the failure to make payments, but the car was destroyed, which is a separate event. Is this a case of frustration or something else?

Wait, the youth stopped making payments, and then the car was destroyed. So the dealership might argue that the youth's breach caused them to lose the remaining payments, but because the car was destroyed, maybe the damages are different.

Alternatively, when the car is destroyed, perhaps the contract is affected. If the car is destroyed, the youth's obligation to pay for it might be discharged under the doctrine of impossibility or frustration of purpose. But frustration of purpose usually requires that the purpose of the contract was frustrated, which may not be the case here. The primary purpose of the contract is the purchase of the car, and if the car is destroyed, the buyer might have a claim for the loss.

Wait, but in this case, the youth is the buyer. So if the car is destroyed by an insured peril, he might have to make a claim on his own insurance, but here, it's destroyed because of an accident, but the dealership is suing him.

Alternatively, the dealership can claim the difference between the contract price and the value after the breach. But the car was destroyed, so perhaps the value is zero? Or the current value is $18,000.

Wait, the car was worth $18k at the time of the accident. So perhaps the youth is liable for the difference between what he paid and the value. Wait, he paid $12k, and the car was worth $18k at the time of destruction. So maybe he still owes the remaining $18k minus the $12k? Or is that not how it works.

Wait, no. The contract was for $36k. He paid $12k, so he still owed $24k. Then the car was destroyed, which is a total loss. So the dealership can't get the full $36k because the car is gone. They might be able to get the difference between what was paid and the value. But wait, the car was destroyed, so perhaps the youth is liable for the loss because he breached the contract by not making payments, leading to the car being repossessed or something. But in this case, the car was destroyed in an accident, not by the dealership.

Alternatively, if the youth breached the contract by not making the payments, the dealership can sue for the unpaid amount, which is $24k. But since the car was destroyed, can they still claim that full amount?

Wait, but the car was his, so if he's the one who caused the destruction, maybe he's liable. But the accident was just an accident; there's no indication it was his fault. So perhaps the destruction was an independent event. So the dealership can't get the full $24k because the car is gone.

Alternatively, the proper recovery might be the amount still owed minus the value of the car. So $24k minus $18k would be $6k. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: when a buyer breaches a contract to purchase goods, the seller can recover the difference between the contract price and the market price, plus any incidental damages. Here, the car is destroyed, so the market price would be zero, but the contract price is $36k. But the youth has already paid $12k.

Wait, the market price at the time of breach would be the current value, which is $18k. So the difference would be $36k - $18k = $18k. But the youth has already paid $12k, so the dealer could claim $18k - $12k = $6k. That would make sense. So the answer would be I: $6,000.

But wait, the youth sent a letter offering $10k, but that's separate. The dealership's proper recovery would be based on the contract terms and the current value.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is E: $30,000, but that seems too high. Or perhaps F: Nothing, but that can't be right because the youth did breach.

Wait, another angle: the youth made 12 payments, so $12k. The total was $36k, so he owed $24k. The car was destroyed, so the dealer can't get the full $24k because the car is gone. So the dealer's loss is the difference between what the car is worth and what they could have sold it for. But the car was destroyed, so they can't sell it. So perhaps the damages are $24k minus $18k, which is $6k. That would be option I.

Alternatively, maybe the proper recovery is the amount still owed minus the value of the car, so $24k - $18k = $6k. So the answer is I.

The youth entered into a contract to purchase a car for $36,000, making $12,000 in payments before breaching the contract by ceasing payments. The car was later destroyed in an accident, leaving it with a value of $18,000. The dealership can recover damages for the breach. Since the youth had already paid $12,000, the remaining balance was $24,000. However, due to the car's destruction, the dealership can only recover the difference between the remaining balance and the car's value at the time of destruction. This difference is $24,000 - $18,000 = $6,000.

Answer: I
