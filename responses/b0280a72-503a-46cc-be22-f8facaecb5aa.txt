Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a conducting solid sphere with an unknown charge. The question is asking me to find the net charge on the sphere based on the electric field measured at a certain distance. Hmm, I remember from my studies that conductors have some specific properties regarding electric fields and charges. Let me think through this step by step.

Alright, the problem states that the sphere has a radius of 10 cm, and the electric field is measured 15 cm away from the center. The electric field's magnitude is 3.0 × 10³ N/C and it's directed radially inward. I need to find the charge on the sphere.

Wait, I think for conducting spheres, the charge resides on the surface. So, the electric field outside the conductor behaves as if all the charge were concentrated at the center. That rings a bell. So, for points outside the sphere (like 15 cm away, which is larger than the 10 cm radius), I can use the formula for the electric field due to a point charge.

The formula for the electric field E is E = kQ / r², where k is Coulomb's constant (8.988×10^9 N·m²/C²), Q is the charge, and r is the distance from the center.

But wait, the direction of the electric field is radially inward. That indicates that the charge is negative because a positive charge would have an outward field, and negative would pull things inward. So, the charge Q must be negative.

So, plugging the numbers into the formula. I'll rearrange the formula to solve for Q: Q = (E * r²) / k.

Given E is 3.0 × 10³ N/C, and r is 15 cm, which is 0.15 m. Let me convert that to meters: yes, 15 cm = 0.15 m.

Calculating r squared: (0.15 m)² = 0.0225 m².

Now, plug into Q: Q = (3.0e3 N/C * 0.0225 m²) / (8.988e9 N·m²/C²).

Let me compute the numerator first: 3.0e3 * 0.0225 = 3e3 * 2.25e-2 = 3 * 2.25 × 1e1 × 1e-2 = 6.75 × 1e1? Wait, no, better to compute it directly.

3.0e3 is 3000. 3000 * 0.0225 = 67.5. So numerator is 67.5 N·m²/C.

Denominator is about 8.988e9. So Q = 67.5 / 8.988e9.

Let me compute that division. 67.5 / 8.988e9 = approximately 7.505e-9 C.

Wait, 67.5 divided by 8.988e9. Let me see: 8.988e9 is about 9e9, so 67.5 /9e9 = 7.5e-9. But more accurately, 67.5 /8.988e9.

Let me compute 67.5 /8.988: 67.5 /8.988 ≈ 7.509, so 7.509e-9 C. That's 7.509 nC. But wait, since the electric field is inward, the charge must be negative, so Q is approximately -7.51 nC.

Looking at the options, option D is -7.5 nC. That seems to match. But wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Wait, wait. Wait a minute. The electric field is given as 3.0e3 N/C. Did I calculate that correctly? Let me recalculate the numerator: 3.0e3 * (0.15)^2.

0.15 squared is 0.0225. So 3e3 * 0.0225 = 3e3 * 2.25e-2 = 6.75e1? Wait, 3e3 is 3 *10^3, 0.0225 is 2.25 *10^-2. Multiply them: 3*2.25=6.75, and 10^3 *10^-2=10^1. So 6.75e1 is 67.5. So yes, that's correct.

Denominator is 8.988e9. So 67.5 /8.988e9 = 67.5 /8.988 ×1e-9.

Compute 67.5 /8.988: let's see, 8.988 is about 9, so 67.5/9=7.5. But let's compute it more accurately.

8.988 *7 = 62.916, which is less than 67.5. 8.988*7.5=67.41. Oh, that's very close to 67.5. So 7.5 times 8.988 is approximately 67.41, which is just a bit less than 67.5. So the quotient is roughly 7.5 + a little more. So 7.505 or so. Hence, 7.505e-9 C, which is about 7.505 nC. So, approximately 7.51 nC. But since the options are given to one decimal place, it's either 7.5 or 7.6, but looking at the options, option D is -7.5 nC, which fits.

Wait, but the options don't have 7.5; option D is -7.5. So that's the choice. Let me check again the options: A to J, with D being -7.5 nC. So yes, that's the answer.

The electric field outside a conducting sphere can be treated as if the charge were at the center. Using the formula \( E = \frac{kQ}{r^2} \), where \( E = 3.0 \times 10^3 \, \mathrm{N/C} \), \( r = 0.15 \, \mathrm{m} \), and \( k = 8.988 \times 10^9 \, \mathrm{N \cdot m^2/C^2} \), we solve for \( Q \). Rearranging gives \( Q = \frac{E \cdot r^2}{k} \). Substituting the values, \( Q = \frac{3.0 \times 10^3 \cdot (0.15)^2}{8.988 \times 10^9} \), which calculates to approximately \( -7.5 \, \mathrm{nC} \). The negative sign indicates the field's inward direction due to a negative charge.
