Okay, so I need to figure out the answer to this question about the ambrosial hours for Sikhs. The question is asking what specific hours are considered the ambrosial hours, and the options are from A to J, each giving a different time range.

First, I should recall what I know about Sikhism. I remember that Sikhs have certain times for prayer and meditation. There's something called the Nitnėam, which are daily prayers. I think these are recited at specific times, and those times are referred to as the ambrosial hours.

I think the ambrosial hours are when the Sikh community gathers for prayers. From what I've heard before, these times are early in the morning and late at night. I'm trying to remember the exact timings. I believe one of the periods is in the morning, maybe around 3 to 6 a.m., which is before dawn. The other time is late at night, perhaps midnight to 3 a.m. But looking at the options, I don't see a midnight to 3 a.m. option. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options, I see option I is 3–6 a.m., and option D is 1–4 a.m. Hmm, the ambrosial hours are considered the most sacred times for prayer, and in the Sikh tradition, these are at Amrit Vela, which is the time before dawn. So that would fall around 3–6 a.m., which is option I. 

Wait, but I thought there was also a night time period. Oh, maybe I'm mixing up the ambrosial hours with the night time prayers. Let me think again. The ambrosial hours are specifically two periods: one in the early morning (before sunrise) and another in the late evening (after sunset). But in the options provided, I only see one that fits the early morning. 

Wait, maybe I'm confusing the terms. The ambrosial hours in Sikhism are known as Amrit Vela, which is typically the period just before dawn, around 3–6 a.m., and also the period after sunset, around 6–9 p.m. But looking at the options, 6–9 p.m. is option C, and 3–6 a.m. is option I. However, the question asks for the hours set aside, so I need to pick the correct one.

Wait, the question says "the ambrosial hours," which is plural, but the options are individual time ranges. So perhaps the correct answer is the one that matches the main time for the ambrosial hours, which is the early morning. Alternatively, maybe the ambrosial hours are considered to be just one period, but I think it's two. However, the options don't have both, so perhaps the primary one is the early morning.

Alternatively, I might be wrong. Maybe the ambrosial hours are specifically the early morning, so option I: 3–6 a.m. Alternatively, I've heard that the ambrosial hours are 3–6 a.m. and 3–6 p.m., but that's not matching the options. Wait, let me think again.

I think the traditional ambrosial hours for Sikhs are from 3 a.m. to 6 a.m., which is option I. So the answer should be I.

The ambrosial hours for Sikhs, known as Amrit Vela, are the most sacred times for prayer and meditation. These occur early in the morning, typically between 3–6 a.m., which corresponds to option I.

Answer: I
