Okay, so I've got this motor problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The motor is 230 volts, armature resistance is 0.3 ohms, runs at 1200 rpm with normal excitation and 50 amp armature current. There are a few parts to the question, and then some options to choose from.

Starting with part (i)(a): When the load increases, the armature current goes up to 60 amps. I need to find the new speed. Hmm, I remember that in motors, speed is related to the current, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact relationship.

Wait, I think for a DC motor, the speed is given by the formula:

V = I * R + (P * Φ * N) / (60 * A)

But wait, maybe it's better to use the speed equation. Oh right, the speed of a DC motor is given by:

N = (V - Ia * Ra) / (P * Φ) * 60

Where:
- V is the supply voltage (230 V here)
- Ia is the armature current
- Ra is the armature resistance (0.3 ohms)
- P is the number of poles (but not given, so maybe it's a constant)
- Φ is the flux per pole (also not given, but since it's normal excitation, maybe it's constant)

So since P and Φ are constant when excitation is normal, the speed is inversely proportional to the armature current. So if current increases, speed decreases.

Wait, but the initial current is 50 A at 1200 rpm. So when current goes to 60 A, the speed should drop. Let's calculate the ratio.

The initial speed N1 is 1200 rpm when Ia1 is 50 A.

So N2 = N1 * (Ia1 / Ia2) ?

Wait, because V is constant, and assuming back EMF is V - Ia * Ra.

So back EMF E = V - Ia * Ra.

E is also equal to (P * Φ * N) / 60.

So if E decreases when Ia increases, N decreases.

So E1 = V - Ia1 * Ra = 230 - 50*0.3 = 230 -15 = 215 V.

Then E2 = 230 - 60*0.3 = 230-18=212 V.

Since E is proportional to N, N2 = N1 * (E2/E1).

Wait no, because E is proportional to N. So N2 = E2 / E1 * N1.

Wait, E1 = k * N1, E2 = k * N2 → N2 = E2 / E1 * N1.

So N2 = (212 / 215) * 1200.

Let me compute that. 212/215 is approximately 0.986.

So 0.986 * 1200 ≈ 1183.2 rpm. Hmm, looking at the options, I see option I has S2 as 1183 rpm. But wait, that's for part (i)(a). Let me check other options.

Option J's S2 is 1190, which is a bit higher. Option A's S2 is 1200, same as initial, which can't be right because the current increased, so speed should drop.

Wait, maybe I should think again. Another approach: The speed is inversely proportional to the armature current because E = V - IaRa, and E is proportional to speed.

So N ∝ (V - IaRa)/Ia? Wait, no, E is proportional to N, so N = (V - IaRa)/K, where K is a constant (PΦ/60).

So when Ia increases, (V - IaRa) decreases, so N decreases.

So initial N1=1200 rpm when Ia=50A.

When Ia=60A,

N2 = (230 - 60*0.3)/(230 -50*0.3) * N1.

Which is (230-18)/(230-15) * 1200 → (212/215)*1200 ≈ 1183.2 rpm. So that's about 1183 rpm.

Looking at the options, option I has S2=1183 rpm, and part (i)(b) would then require another calculation.

Wait, part (i)(b) is when the load is reduced, so Ia drops to 25 A.

Using the same approach:

N3 = (230 -25*0.3)/(230-50*0.3) *1200.

25*0.3=7.5, so numerator is 222.5.

Denominator is 215 as before.

So N3= (222.5/215)*1200 ≈ (1.0348)*1200 ≈ 1241.8 rpm.

Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see any option where S3 is around 1242. Option I has S3=1242 rpm, which matches exactly. So for part (i), the answers would be S2≈1183 rpm and S3≈1242 rpm.

Now looking at the options, option I has S2=1183 and S3=1242. That fits part (i). So part (i) is done.

Moving to part (ii)(a): Starting the motor without auxiliary resistance. What's the initial current when the switch is closed?

At start, the armature is at rest, so back EMF E is zero. So the voltage across the armature is V = Ia * Ra.

Wait, but that's not correct because when starting, the counter EMF is zero, so the armature resistance is only Ra, so the current would be V/Ra.

Wait, V is 230 V, Ra is 0.3 ohms.

So Ia = V/Ra = 230 / 0.3 ≈ 766.67 amps. That's a very high current.

Looking at the options, I see several options where I_a is around 765-766. Option A: I_a=766 amp, option I: I_a=766(2/3) which is 766.666..., option J has 765.

Wait, 230/0.3 is exactly 766.666..., so that's 766.666... A. So the closest is option I, which says I_a=766(2/3) amp, which is 766.666... So part (ii)(a) answer is I_a=766.666 A, which is in option I.

Now part (ii)(b): What series resistance R_s should be inserted to limit the starting current to 1.5 times the normal value, which is 1.5*50=75 A.

Wait, no, wait: the normal armature current is 50 A under running conditions, but during starting, the current would be higher. So we need to limit the starting current to 1.5 times 50 A, which is 75 A.

So we need to find R_s such that when the motor starts (back EMF zero), the current is 75 A.

The total resistance in the armature circuit when starting is Ra + R_s.

So Ia = V/(Ra + R_s) = 75 A.

So 230/(0.3 + R_s) =75 → 0.3 + R_s =230/75 ≈3.0667 ohms.

So R_s=3.0667 -0.3=2.7667 ohms.

Looking at the options, option I has R_s=2.77 ohms, which is very close.

So putting it all together:

(i)(a) S2=1183 rpm,

(i)(b) S3=1242 rpm,

(ii)(a) I_a=766.666 A,

(ii)(b) R_s=2.77 ohms.

Looking at the options, option I matches all these values.
</think>

The motor's speed decreases when the armature current increases due to the back EMF reducing. Conversely, the speed increases when the current decreases. Calculations show the new speeds are approximately 1183 rpm and 1242 rpm for parts (i)(a) and (i)(b), respectively. Starting without auxiliary resistance results in a very high current of about 766.67 A. To limit the starting current to 75 A, a series resistance of approximately 2.77 ohms is required.
