Question:

A 37-year-old woman with right lower extremity edema is evaluated because of the sudden onset of shortness of breath and pleuritic chest pain. A diagnosis of pulmonary embolism is made. Which of the following signs, if present on physical examination, would be the most specific indicator of pulmonary arterial hypertension in this patient?

Options:

A: Blue lips or skin
B: Peripheral edema
C: Rapid heart rate
D: Constant chest pain
E: Presence of an S3
F: Wheezing or whistling sound when breathing
G: Shortness of breath after slight activity
H: P2 louder than A2
I: Increased jugular venous pressure
J: Coughing up blood

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this medical question about pulmonary embolism and signs of pulmonary arterial hypertension. Let's break it down step by step.

The patient is a 37-year-old woman with right lower extremity edema. She presents with sudden shortness of breath and pleuritic chest pain, and a diagnosis of pulmonary embolism is made. The question is asking which physical exam sign is the most specific indicator of pulmonary arterial hypertension in this patient.

First, I remember that pulmonary embolism (PE) can lead to various complications, one of which is pulmonary hypertension. Pulmonary hypertension is when the pressure in the pulmonary arteries is too high. So, the question is about identifying the physical sign that's most specific to this condition.

Looking at the options:

A: Blue lips or skin – Cyanosis can indicate low oxygen levels, which can be due to many causes, not just pulmonary hypertension. So it's not specific.

B: Peripheral edema – This is related to the initial edema mentioned, probably due to deep vein thrombosis (DVT) leading to PE. But it's more about venous issues than specifically pulmonary hypertension.

C: Rapid heart rate – Tachycardia can occur with many conditions, including anxiety, fever, or PE itself. It's a non-specific finding.

D: Constant chest pain – Pleuritic pain can be from PE, but it's not specific to hypertension.

E: Presence of an S3 – An S3 heart sound can indicate volume overload or heart failure, which might be a result of pulmonary hypertension, but it's not the most specific sign.

F: Wheezing or whistling – This is more about airflow obstruction, like asthma or COPD, not directly indicative of pulmonary hypertension.

G: Shortness of breath after slight activity – While dyspnea is common in PE, it's not specific to hypertension.

H: P2 louder than A2 – The P2 is the sound of blood flow through the pulmonary artery. If it's louder than the A2 (which is the sound of the aortic valve closing), it suggests increased pulmonary artery pressure because the blood is moving through a narrower or higher-pressure area. This is a classic sign of pulmonary hypertension.

I: Increased jugular venous pressure – This is related to right-sided heart failure, which can be a consequence of pulmonary hypertension but isn't the direct sign.

J: Coughing up blood – Hemoptysis can occur with PE but isn't specific to hypertension.

So, the most specific indicator here would be option H, where P2 is louder than A2. This is because it directly relates to the increased pressure in the pulmonary arteries, which is pulmonary hypertension.

The most specific indicator of pulmonary arterial hypertension in this patient is the presence of a loud P2 heart sound compared to A2. This finding directly points to increased pulmonary artery pressure. 

Answer: H
