Question:

K_dissof water for 2H_2O \rightleftarrows H_3O^+ + OH^- changes from 1.0 × 10^-14 at 25°C to 9.62 × 10^-14 at 60°C. Does the pH of water or its neutrality change when the temperature is increased from 25°C to 60°C?

Options:

A: Neutrality changes, with water becoming more basic, while pH remains constant
B: Only pH changes, but the value increases
C: pH decreases slightly, while neutrality remains the same
D: Neither pH nor neutrality change
E: pH doesn't change, neutrality changes
F: Only neutrality changes, but the water becomes more acidic
G: pH changes, neutrality doesn't
H: Both pH and neutrality change, with water becoming more acidic
I: Both pH and neutrality change
J: Both pH and neutrality remain constant, but the concentration of H_3O^+ increases

Okay, so I've got this chemistry question here about the dissociation of water and how pH and neutrality change with temperature. Hmm, let me think through this.

The question says that the dissociation constant, K_w, for water changes from 1.0 × 10^-14 at 25°C to 9.62 × 10^-14 at 60°C. I remember that K_w is related to the concentration of H+ and OH- ions in water. At 25°C, pure water has a pH of 7 because [H+]=[OH-]=1e-7 M. 

Wait, but when temperature increases, K_w increases. Oh right, because water becomes more ionized at higher temperatures. So at 60°C, K_w is higher, which means the product of [H+][OH-] is higher than 1e-14. 

In pure water, [H+] should equal [OH-] because water is neutral. So if K_w increases, both [H+] and [OH-] must increase, but they're still equal. Let me calculate: at 60°C, K_w is 9.62e-14. So [H+]^2 = 9.62e-14, so [H+] = sqrt(9.62e-14) ≈ 3.1e-7 M. So pH would be -log(3.1e-7) ≈ 6.51. Wait, that's less than 7. So pH decreases, but since [H+]=[OH-], water remains neutral. 

Wait, but the options are about whether pH or neutrality changes. So the pH is now around 6.5, which is less than 7, so the pH has changed. But since [H+]=[OH-], the solution is still neutral. So the pH changes (it's lower), but neutrality doesn't change because it's still a neutral solution. 

Looking at the options, option C says pH decreases slightly, neutrality same. Option I says both change. Option G says pH changes, neutrality doesn't. Wait, option I is "Both pH and neutrality change, with water becoming more acidic." But wait, the solution is still neutral because [H+]=[OH-], so neutrality doesn't change. So pH changes, but neutrality remains the same. That would be option C or G.

Wait, let me recheck. At 60°C, [H+]=sqrt(Kw) = sqrt(9.62e-14) ≈ 3.1e-7. So pH is about 6.5, which is below 7, but because [H+]=[OH-], it's still neutral. So the pH changes, but neutrality doesn't. Looking at options, option C says pH decreases while neutrality remains same. Option G says pH changes, neutrality doesn't. Let me check the options again.

Option C: pH decreases slightly, neutrality same. Option G: pH changes, neutrality doesn't. Both seem possible, but perhaps option C is more specific. The question asks if pH or neutrality change. So pH does change (it decreases), but neutrality remains the same because H+ and OH- are equal. So the answer would be option C or G. Wait, looking at the options again:

Option C: pH decreases, neutrality same.

Option G: pH changes, neutrality doesn't.

Hmm, both are correct in a way, but option C is more specific about the direction of pH change. But I think option I is incorrect because neutrality doesn't change. So the correct answer is either C or G. Wait, let me look at the options again.

Looking at the options:

A: Neutrality changes, pH remains.

B: Only pH changes, increases.

C: pH decreases, neutrality same.

D: Neither changes.

E: pH doesn't change, neutrality changes.

F: Only neutrality changes, becomes acidic.

G: pH changes, neutrality doesn't.

H: Both change, becomes acidic.

I: Both change.

J: Both constant, but [H3O+] increases.

Wait, in pure water, K_w increases, so [H+] and [OH-] increase, but remain equal. So pH decreases (from 7 to ~6.5), but water is still neutral because H+ = OH-. So pH changes (decreases), neutrality doesn't change. So the correct option is C: pH decreases slightly, neutrality same. Or is it G?

Wait, option C says pH decreases, neutrality same. Option G says pH changes, neutrality doesn't. Both are correct, but perhaps the question is whether pH remains the same. No, pH changes. So the answer is either C or G. Wait, the options are:

C: pH decreases, neutrality same.

G: pH changes, neutrality doesn’t.

But the question is whether pH of water or its neutrality changes. So if pH changes, but neutrality doesn't, then the correct answer is C or G. Wait, but in the options, C is more specific about pH decreasing, while G is more general. The question is, does the pH change? Yes. Does neutrality change? No. So the correct answer is C: pH decreases, neutrality same. Wait, but option C says pH decreases, but in reality, it doesn't decrease, because the solution is still neutral. Wait, no, the pH is lower than 7, but the solution is neutral. So the pH changes, but neutrality doesn't. So the correct answer is G.

The dissociation constant of water, \( K_w \), increases from \( 1.0 \times 10^{-14} \) at 25°C to \( 9.62 \times 10^{-14} \) at 60°C. This means that at higher temperatures, water becomes more ionized, with both \([H^+]\) and \([OH^-]\) increasing. However, in pure water, \([H^+]\) remains equal to \([OH^-]\), so the solution remains neutral. 

At 60°C, \([H^+]\) and \([OH^-]\) are calculated as approximately \( 3.1 \times 10^{-7} \) M, giving a pH of about 6.5. While the pH decreases below 7, the water remains neutral because \([H^+]\) equals \([OH^-]\). Therefore, the pH changes (decreases), but neutrality does not change.

Among the options, **C** states that the pH decreases slightly while neutrality remains the same, which aligns with the analysis. However, **G** states that the pH changes, but neutrality does not, which is also correct. Since **C** is more specific about the pH decrease, it is the better choice.

Answer: C
