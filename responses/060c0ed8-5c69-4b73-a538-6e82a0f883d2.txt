Okay, so I've got this problem here about fencing a rectangular yard. Let me try to understand what's being asked. The problem says that a total of x feet of fencing is used to form three sides of a level rectangular yard. I need to find the maximum possible area of the yard in terms of x.

Hmm, let's break this down. A rectangle has four sides, but here they're only using three sides. I'm assuming that maybe one side isn't fenced, perhaps because it's against a wall or something. So, the fencing is for two lengths and one width, or maybe two widths and one length. Wait, but the problem says three sides, so maybe it's two lengths and one width, or two widths and one length. I'm a bit confused, but I think it's standard to have the three sides as two lengths and one width, with the fourth side being, say, a house or a wall that doesn't need fencing.

Wait, but I should probably clarify. Let me visualize this. If the yard is rectangular, and three sides are fenced, it's probably two sides of one dimension and one side of the other. For example, if the yard has length L and width W, then the fencing would be L + W + L, totaling 2L + W = x. Or alternatively, it could be W + L + W, which is 2W + L = x. But I think the first scenario is more common, where the front is fenced as the length and the two sides as the widths. Wait, no, that would be W + L + W, which is 2W + L. Hmm, maybe I should define variables properly.

Let me define the sides. Let's say the yard has a length 'L' and a width 'W'. If the fencing is three sides, perhaps it's the two widths and one length, so the total fencing is L + 2W = x. That makes sense because if the yard is against a wall, you wouldn't need fencing on the fourth side, which would be the other length. So the fencing is for two widths and one length.

So, the equation is L + 2W = x. Now, I need to express the area in terms of L and W, and then find the maximum area.

The area A of the yard is L * W. But since I have only one equation and two variables, I need to express one variable in terms of the other using the fencing constraint.

From L + 2W = x, I can solve for L: L = x - 2W.

Now, substitute this into the area formula: A = (x - 2W) * W = xW - 2W².

So, A = xW - 2W². Now, to find the maximum area, I can treat this as a quadratic equation in terms of W. Since the coefficient of W² is negative, the parabola opens downward, meaning the vertex is the maximum point.

The standard form of a quadratic is aW² + bW + c, so here a = -2, b = x.

The vertex of a parabola given by a quadratic equation is at W = -b/(2a). Plugging in the values, W = -x/(2*(-2)) = x/(4).

Wait, that seems right. So W = x/4.

Now, substitute W back into the equation for L: L = x - 2*(x/4) = x - x/2 = x/2.

So, L is x/2 and W is x/4. Now, the area A is L*W = (x/2)*(x/4) = x²/8.

Wait, but looking at the options, D is x²/8, so that's one possibility. But let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

Alternatively, let's consider taking the derivative if I treat A as a function of W. So A(W) = xW - 2W². The derivative A'(W) is x - 4W. Setting derivative to zero for maximum: x - 4W = 0 → W = x/4. Same result. So L is x - 2*(x/4) = x - x/2 = x/2. So area is (x/2)*(x/4) = x²/8. So that seems correct.

Wait, but let me think again. Maybe I swapped L and W somewhere. Because if the fencing is three sides, perhaps it's two lengths and one width. Let me check that scenario.

If the fencing is two lengths and one width, then the total fencing would be 2L + W = x. Then, express W as x - 2L.

Area A = L * W = L*(x - 2L) = xL - 2L².

Again, take derivative: A'(L) = x - 4L. Set to zero: x - 4L =0 → L = x/4.

Then W = x - 2*(x/4) = x - x/2 = x/2.

Area is L*W = (x/4)*(x/2) = x²/8. Same result.

Wait, so regardless of whether the three sides are two lengths and a width or two widths and a length, the maximum area ends up being x²/8. So the answer would be D: x²/8.

But let me check the options again. The options are:

A: 2x²

B: x²/6

C: x³/8

D: x²/8

E: x²/4

F: x²/9

G: x²/16

H: x²/12

I: x²

J: x²/2

So D is x²/8, which matches our calculation. Therefore, the correct answer should be D.

The problem involves maximizing the area of a rectangular yard using x feet of fencing for three sides. By defining the length and width and applying the fencing constraint, the maximum area is found to be x²/8.

Answer: D
