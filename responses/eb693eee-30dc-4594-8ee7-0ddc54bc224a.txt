The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

You have a coin and you would like to check whether it is fair or biased. More specifically, let $\theta$ be the probability of heads, $\theta = P(H)$. Suppose that you need to choose between the following hypotheses: H_0 (null hypothesis): The coin is fair, i.e. $\theta = \theta_0 = 1 / 2$. H_1 (the alternative hypothesis): The coin is not fair, i.e. $\theta > 1 / 2$. We toss 100 times and observe 60 heads. What is the P-value?

Options:

A: 0.115
B: 0.28
C: 0.023
D: 0.157
E: 0.95
F: 0.001
G: 0.5
H: 0.1
I: 0.05
J: 0.082

Okay, so I have this statistics problem here about determining whether a coin is fair or biased. The question is about calculating the p-value after observing 60 heads in 100 tosses. Hmm, I remember that p-value is the probability of getting a result as extreme as the one observed, assuming the null hypothesis is true. 

The null hypothesis here is that the coin is fair, so θ = 1/2. The alternative hypothesis is that θ > 1/2, meaning the coin is biased towards heads. We did 100 tosses and saw 60 heads, which is more than the expected 50 if it were fair. 

I think I need to use a hypothesis test for a single proportion. The formula for the test statistic in such cases is usually Z = (p̂ - p0) / sqrt(p0*(1-p0)/n), where p̂ is the sample proportion, p0 is the hypothesized proportion under H0, and n is the sample size.

So, plugging in the numbers: p̂ is 60/100 = 0.6, p0 is 0.5, and n is 100. 

Calculating the numerator: 0.6 - 0.5 = 0.1.

The denominator is sqrt(0.5*(1-0.5)/100) = sqrt(0.25/100) = sqrt(0.0025) = 0.05.

So the Z-score is 0.1 / 0.05 = 2.0. 

Now, since the alternative hypothesis is one-sided (θ > 1/2), I need the probability that Z is greater than 2.0. 

Looking up Z=2.0 in the standard normal distribution table, the area to the left is about 0.9772. So the area to the right, which is the p-value, is 1 - 0.9772 = 0.0228. 

Wait, but sometimes tables give the area beyond Z as the p-value. Let me double-check. Oh right, for a one-tailed test, the p-value is the area beyond Z. So 0.0228 is approximately 0.023. 

Looking at the options, option C is 0.023. So I think that's the correct answer.

The p-value is calculated using the test statistic Z = 2.0, leading to a one-tailed p-value of approximately 0.023.
