Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about the hygiene hypothesis. Let me start by understanding what the question is asking. The question says that a reduction in family size and improved sanitary conditions have led to an increase in allergic conditions. Then it's asking what the hygiene hypothesis suggests. 

Hmm, I remember that the hygiene hypothesis is related to why allergies have been increasing. I think it's something about how being too clean might be bad for our immune systems. The idea is that exposure to certain germs and allergens when we're young helps our immune system develop properly, so we don't get allergies later on.

Looking at the options, I need to pick which one aligns with this idea. Let's go through each choice one by one.

Option A: Living on a working farm will increase the development of atopic diseases. Wait, atopic diseases are allergies like eczema and hay fever. If living on a farm increases these, that's the opposite of what I thought. Farms usually have more exposure to different allergens and bacteria, so I don't think this is right.

Option B: Particular care must be taken during breastfeeding in high-risk infants. I'm not sure how this connects. Breastfeeding is generally good for the immune system, but I don't think this is about the hygiene hypothesis directly.

Option C: Living on a working farm will help reduce the development of atopic diseases. This seems more in line with what I remember. Farms have more dirt and allergens, so exposure might reduce allergies. That fits with the hygiene hypothesis.

Option D: Using antibiotics frequently will reduce allergies. Wait, antibiotics kill bacteria, but maybe reducing exposure to bacteria could be bad. I think too much antibiotic use might actually increase allergies because it disrupts the microbiome. So this doesn't seem right.

Option E: Living in urban areas will help reduce the development of atopic diseases. Urban areas are more sanitized, so maybe they contribute to more allergies. So this option is suggesting the opposite of what the hygiene hypothesis says, so probably not correct.

Option F: The frequent use of antiseptic swipes will reduce allergies. Again, being too clean might lead to more allergies, so using antiseptics more would probably increase, not reduce, allergies. So this is likely wrong.

Option G: Exposure to allergens in early childhood will increase the risk of developing allergies. Wait, no, the hygiene hypothesis says that exposure helps reduce allergies. So this is the opposite. So G is incorrect.

Option H: Staying in highly sanitized environments will reduce the development of atopic diseases. No, because the hygiene hypothesis suggests that being too clean can lead to more allergies. So H is wrong.

Option I: Breastfeeding should be avoided in high-risk infants to prevent allergies. I think breastfeeding is actually protective against allergies, so this is the opposite of what's correct.

Option J: The use of probiotics in infants will increase the development of atopic diseases. I'm not too sure about this. Probiotics are good for the gut microbiome, which is linked to the immune system. Maybe they help reduce allergies, so this option says they increase, which might be incorrect.

So putting it all together, the hygiene hypothesis suggests that exposure to germs and allergens early in life helps prevent allergies. Therefore, living on a working farm, which exposes you to more of these, would reduce atopic diseases. So option C makes sense.

The hygiene hypothesis posits that exposure to germs and allergens in early childhood helps the immune system develop properly, thereby reducing the risk of allergies. Based on this understanding, living on a working farm, which exposes individuals to more allergens and bacteria, aligns with the hypothesis by suggesting a reduction in atopic diseases. 

Answer: C
