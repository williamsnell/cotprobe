Okay, so I have this question about universal gates in logic circuits. I remember that universal gates are those that can be used to create any other type of gate. The question is asking which set of gates are designated as universal.

First, I need to recall which gates are considered universal. From what I remember, NAND and NOR gates are the primary universal gates. That's because you can construct any other gate (like AND, OR, NOT, XOR, etc.) using just NAND or just NOR gates. I think that's right because they're functionally complete on their own.

Looking at the options:

Option A: XOR, XNOR, NOR. Hmm, XOR and XNOR aren't universal on their own, but maybe combined with NOR they could be? Not sure, but I don't think this is a standard universal set.

Option B: OR, NOT, AND. These are the basic gates, but I don't think they're universal because you can't make all gates from them unless you have NAND or NOR. Wait, no, actually, using AND, OR, and NOT, you can make other gates, but are they considered universal? I think NAND and NOR are the ones that are called universal because they alone can do everything. So B might not be correct.

Option C: NOR, NAND, XNOR. Well, NOR and NAND are definitely universal. But does adding XNOR make it a universal set? I think the presence of just NOR or NAND is enough, but this option includes both, which is more than needed. I'm not sure if this is a standard answer.

Option D: AND, OR. Definitely not universal because you can't make NOT gates from just AND and OR. So D is out.

Option E: OR, XOR, NOT. XOR isn't universal, so E probably isn't correct.

Option F: XOR, XNOR. Both are not universal on their own, so F is out.

Option G: AND, OR, NOT, NAND. NAND is universal, so including it here makes this set universal. But the question is about the gate designations as universal. So G is a correct set because it includes NAND, but does the question mean which individual gates are universal, or which combination is sufficient?

Option H: NOT, AND, NAND. NAND is there, so this set includes a universal gate. So H might be correct, but I'm not sure if it's the only one.

Option I: XOR, NOR, NAND. Again, NAND is there, making it universal. So I is correct.

Option J: NOR, NAND. Both are universal gates, so this set is definitely universal. Because each can create all other gates, so including both would make the set universal.

Wait, but the question is asking which sets are designated as universal gates. So the correct universal gates are NAND and NOR. So the sets that include either NAND or NOR or both would be universal.

Looking back, options J is just NAND and NOR, which are both universal. So J is a correct set. Option C includes NAND, but also XNOR. So it's more than needed. Option G includes NAND, so it's universal. Option H includes NAND. Option I includes NAND. So the question is asking which of these sets are designated as universal gates. So any set that includes at least NAND or NOR would be universal.

Wait, but the question says "designated as universal gates". Maybe it's about which individual gates are universal. Oh wait, the question says "sets of logic gates are designated as universal gates." So which sets are universal. The minimal universal sets are those that include either NAND or NOR.

So looking for options that include NAND or NOR or both.

Option A: XOR, XNOR, NOR. Includes NOR, so A is a universal set.

Option B: No NAND or NOR, so no.

Option C: Includes NAND and NOR, so C is universal.

Option G: Includes NAND, so G is universal.

Option H: Includes NAND, so H is universal.

Option I: Includes NAND, so I is universal.

Option J: Includes NAND and NOR, so J is universal.

Wait, but the question is asking which sets are "designated" as universal. The standard universal gates are NAND and NOR. So any set that includes at least one of them is universal. So options A, C, G, H, I, J all include NAND or NOR, so they're all universal sets. But the options are the letters A through J, and the question is which one is correct.

Wait, the options are A to J, each a set. The correct answer should be the set that contains only universal gates, but more importantly, which sets are considered universal.

Wait, the standard answer is that NAND and NOR are the universal gates. So any set that includes either NAND or NOR is universal. So for example, option J is {NOR, NAND}, which are both universal gates.

But the question is asking which sets are designated as universal gates. So perhaps the minimal universal sets are the ones that include just NAND or just NOR. But the options don't have that. For example, option J includes both, which is also a universal set, but maybe the question wants the set that includes the minimal universal gates.

Alternatively, the correct answer is that any set that includes NAND or NOR is universal. So the options that include NAND or NOR are correct.

Looking back at the options, the correct answer is either J, as both NAND and NOR are universal, or any set that includes them.

Wait, but the question is a bit ambiguous. It's asking which sets are designated as universal gates. So perhaps the correct answer is any set that includes NAND or NOR. So looking at the options, which ones include NAND or NOR.

Looking:

A: includes NOR → yes.

B: no.

C: includes NAND and NOR → yes.

D: no.

E: no.

F: no.

G: includes NAND → yes.

H: includes NAND → yes.

I: includes NAND → yes.

J: includes both → yes.

Wait, but the options given are A to J, each a set. So the correct answers are all the options that include NAND or NOR. But the question is a multiple-choice, so perhaps the intended correct answer is that NAND and NOR are the universal gates, so J is the set containing both.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering that a universal gate is a single gate that can implement any function, so NAND and NOR are each universal on their own. So a set that includes either is universal.

But the options are sets, so any set containing NAND or NOR is universal.

But the question is about which sets are designated as universal. So perhaps the intended correct answer is J, because it's the pair of NAND and NOR, which are both universal.

Wait, but the question is about which sets are designated as universal gates. So a set is universal if it contains at least one universal gate. So any set that includes NAND or NOR is a universal set.

But the options are A through J, and the question is to select which set is designated as universal.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking which of these sets are considered universal gates. So each individual gate in the set must be universal. But that's not the case because, for example, in option A, XOR isn't a universal gate.

Wait, no, that's not right. Because a universal gate is a gate that can implement any Boolean function on its own. So NAND and NOR are universal, but AND, OR, XOR, etc., are not.

So the question is, which of these sets consist entirely of universal gates. So each gate in the set must be a universal gate.

So for each option, check if all gates are universal.

So NAND and NOR are the only universal gates. So any set containing only NAND and/or NOR is a set of universal gates.

Looking at the options:

A: XOR, XNOR, NOR → XOR and XNOR are not universal. So A is incorrect.

B: OR, NOT, AND → None of these are universal except NOT? Wait, NOT is a universal gate? Wait, no, NOT is a basic gate but not a universal gate on its own because you can't make all gates with just NOT. Wait, no, wait: Wait, can you make other gates with just NOT? No, because NOT is only inverting. So NOT alone isn't universal. So B is incorrect.

C: NOR, NAND, XNOR → XNOR isn't universal, so C is incorrect.

D: AND, OR → Neither is universal. D is incorrect.

E: OR, XOR, NOT → None are universal. E is incorrect.

F: XOR, XNOR → Neither is universal. F is incorrect.

G: AND, OR, NOT, NAND → AND, OR, NOT aren't universal, but NAND is. So since the set includes NAND, which is universal, but also includes non-universal gates, G is a universal set because at least one is universal. Wait, but the question is about the set being designated as universal gates. So perhaps the set must consist only of universal gates. So if the set includes a non-universal gate, then it's not a set of universal gates.

Wait, that's a confusion. The question is: "Which of these sets of logic gates are designated as universal gates?" So each gate in the set must be a universal gate. Because a universal gate is a gate that can implement any function on its own.

So for example, if a set includes AND, which is not universal, then the set is not composed solely of universal gates. So the correct set must consist only of gates that are universal.

So NAND and NOR are the only universal gates. So any set that includes only NAND and/or NOR is correct.

Looking again:

A: includes XOR and XNOR → not universal.

B: includes OR, NOT, AND → not universal.

C: includes XNOR → not universal.

D: AND, OR → not universal.

E: OR, XOR, NOT → not universal.

F: XOR, XNOR → not universal.

G: includes AND, OR, NOT → not universal. So G is incorrect.

H: NOT, AND, NAND → NOT and AND are not universal, but NAND is. But since the set includes non-universal gates, H is not correct.

I: XOR, NOR, NAND → XOR is not universal, so I is incorrect.

J: NOR and NAND → both are universal. So J is correct.

So the correct answer is J.
</think>

The question asks which set of logic gates are designated as universal gates. Universal gates are those that can implement any Boolean function on their own. The gates that are considered universal are NAND and NOR. For a set to be designated as universal, all gates in the set must be universal. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Includes XOR and XNOR, which are not universal. Incorrect.
- **B**: Includes OR, NOT, and AND, none of which are universal. Incorrect.
- **C**: Includes XNOR, which is not universal. Incorrect.
- **D**: Includes AND and OR, neither of which are universal. Incorrect.
- **E**: Includes OR, XOR, and NOT, none of which are universal. Incorrect.
- **F**: Includes XOR and XNOR, neither of which are universal. Incorrect.
- **G**: Includes AND, OR, NOT, and NAND. While NAND is universal, the set also includes non-universal gates. Incorrect.
- **H**: Includes NOT, AND, and NAND. While NAND is universal, the set also includes non-universal gates. Incorrect.
- **I**: Includes XOR, NOR, and NAND. While NOR and NAND are universal, the set also includes XOR, which is not universal. Incorrect.
- **J**: Includes only NOR and NAND, both of which are universal. Correct.

Thus, the correct answer is **J**.
