Okay, so I've got this problem here about the cost of producing cameras. The function given is C(x) = 2 + x³. I need to find the average cost when producing 10 cameras and also the marginal cost at that production level. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.

First, I remember that average cost is calculated by dividing the total cost by the number of units produced. So, average cost AC(x) is C(x) divided by x. Marginal cost, on the other hand, is the derivative of the cost function, which gives the cost of producing one more unit. So I'll need to find C'(x) and then plug in x=10.

Let me start with the average cost. When x is 10, I need to compute C(10) first. C(10) = 2 + (10)³. 10 cubed is 1000, so adding 2 gives C(10) = 1002. Now, to find the average cost, I divide this by 10. So AC(10) = 1002 / 10. Let me do that division: 1002 divided by 10 is 100.2. Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see 100.2 as an average cost. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check again.

Wait, no, 10 cubed is definitely 1000, plus 2 is 1002. Divided by 10, that's 100.2. But none of the options have 100.2. Let me see the options again. Let's check each option for the average cost.

Option A: $1000/unit. That's way too high. Option B: $300. No, 1002 is 100.2. Option C: $300, same as B. Option D: $102. That's 102*10=1020, but our C is 1002. So D's average is 102, but our calculation is 100.2. Hmm, maybe a typo? Or perhaps I miscalculated.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the cost function. The function is C(x) = 2 + x³. So when x=10, it's 2 + 1000, which is 1002. So average is 100.2. But looking at the options, the closest is maybe D: $102, but that's 102*10=1020, which is 18 more than 1002. That doesn't fit. So perhaps I need to look again. Wait, maybe the average cost is 1002/10, which is 100.2, but the options don't have that. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options, option I has an average cost of $1020, which would be if x=10, but C(x) = 2 +10^3=1002, so 1002/10=100.2. None of the options match except perhaps none, but wait, maybe I'm miscalculating something.

Wait, perhaps I should check the marginal cost as well. The marginal cost is the derivative of C(x). The derivative of x³ is 3x², so C'(x) = 3x². At x=10, that's 3*(10)^2=3*100=300. So marginal cost is $300.

Now, looking at the options, let's see which ones have marginal cost as 300. Option J: marginal cost 300. Let's check its average cost: it says $100. But our average cost was 100.2, which isn't exactly 100, but perhaps the question expects rounding or maybe a typo. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the average cost calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck C(x). C(x) = 2 + x³. So at x=10, it's 2 + 1000 = 1002. Divided by 10 is 100.2. So average cost is 100.2. But none of the options show that. Let me look again at the options.

Looking at option J: average cost $100, marginal cost $300. That would match the marginal cost I calculated. But the average cost would be 100.2, not exactly 100. Perhaps the question expects rounding, so 100.2 rounds to 100. So option J would be correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check option D: average cost 102. C(10)=1002, so 1002/10=100.2, which is 100.2, not 102. So that can't be right.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the function. Oh wait, the function is C(x)=2 +x³. So when x=10, it's 2 + 1000=1002. So average is 100.2, which is $100.20 per unit. The options don't have that, but option J has average cost $100 and marginal cost $300. So perhaps the question expects us to round to the nearest dollar, making it $100 average and $300 marginal.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating C(x). Let me double-check. 10^3 is 1000, plus 2 is 1002. That's correct. Divided by 10 is 100.2. So the average cost is approximately $100.20. So among the options, only J has average cost $100 and marginal cost $300.

So the correct answer would be J.

The total cost function is C(x) = 2 + x³. To find the average cost when producing 10 cameras, calculate C(10) = 2 + 10³ = 1002. The average cost is 1002 / 10 = 100.2. For the marginal cost, take the derivative C'(x) = 3x², and evaluate at x=10: C'(10) = 3*100 = 300. Among the options, J matches these results (average cost $100, marginal cost $300).

Answer: J
