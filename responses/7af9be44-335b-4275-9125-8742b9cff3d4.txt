Question:

A computer program uses 3 bits to represent integers. When the program adds the decimal (base 10) numbers 5 and 3, the result is 0. Which of the following is the best explanation for the result?

Options:

A: The result was approximated by a floating-point representation.
B: A round-off error occurred.
C: An overflow error occurred.
D: The program uses a non-standard numerical representation.
E: The program failed to carry over during the addition process.
F: The program calculated the sum in binary, not in decimal.
G: An underflow error occurred.
H: The program uses a 2's complement system and the result is a negative number.
I: The result was affected by lossy data compression.
J: There was a syntax error in the addition operation.

Okay, so I've got this question about a computer program using 3 bits to represent integers. When it adds 5 and 3 in decimal, the result is 0. I need to figure out why that happened from the given options.

First, let me think about how 3 bits work. Since 3 bits can represent integers, the maximum positive number would be 7 (since 111 in binary is 7). But wait, actually, if it's using signed integers, the range changes. For 3 bits, using two's complement, the range is from -4 to 3. Because the first bit is the sign bit: 0 for positive, 1 for negative. So the maximum positive is 3 (011) and the minimum negative is -4 (100).

Now, adding 5 and 3 in decimal. Normally, that's 8. But 8 in binary with 3 bits is 1000, which is 4 bits. Since the program only uses 3 bits, adding 5 and 3 would cause an overflow because the result exceeds the maximum representable value.

So, what happens when you add 5 and 3 in a 3-bit system? Let me do the binary addition. 5 is 101, 3 is 011. Adding them:

101 (5)
+011 (3)
------
1000 (8)

But with 3 bits, the fourth bit (the carry) is lost. So the result stored would be 000, which is 0. That's why the program shows 0 as the result. So the issue is overflow because the sum exceeds the maximum value that can be stored.

Looking at the options:

C: An overflow error occurred. This seems correct because the sum goes beyond the 3-bit limit.

H: The program uses two's complement and the result is negative. Wait, if it's 000, that's zero, not a negative number. So H might not be the right choice. Unless I'm misunderstanding. Let me think again. In two's complement, 000 is zero, not negative. So maybe H isn't the case. Or perhaps in another scenario.

Wait, if the sum is 8, which is 1000, but stored in 3 bits, it wraps around. So 8 mod 8 is 0, but in two's complement, the 3 bits can represent up to 3, so 8 would wrap to -0? Or maybe it's treated as 0. Hmm, but two's complement for 3 bits, 1000 would actually be treated as 0 because it's beyond the 3 bits. So the result is zero, not a negative number. So H might not be the correct explanation.

So the best explanation is C: An overflow error occurred.

The program uses 3 bits, which can represent integers from -4 to 3 in two's complement. Adding 5 (101) and 3 (011) results in 8 (1000), exceeding the 3-bit capacity. The carry is lost, leaving 000, which is 0. This is an overflow error.

Answer: C
