Question:

A package of paper towels has 12 rolls of paper towels in it. Mr. Kelly wants to put an equal number of rolls of paper towels into 4 rooms. He uses the number sentence below to find the number of rolls of paper towels, t, he should put into each room. 12 ÷ t = 4 Which number sentence shows another way Mr. Kelly can find the number of rolls of paper towels, t, he should put into each room?

Options:

A: 12 – t = 4
B: 4 ÷ 12 = t
C: 4 × t = 12
D: t – 4 = 12
E: 4 + 12 = t
F: 4 – t = 12
G: t + 4 = 12
H: t ÷ 4 = 12

Okay, so I've got this problem here about Mr. Kelly and his paper towels. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

Alright, the problem says there's a package with 12 rolls of paper towels. Mr. Kelly wants to put an equal number of rolls into 4 rooms. He uses the number sentence 12 ÷ t = 4 to find t, which is the number of rolls per room. Now, the question is asking for another way to write a number sentence that would give the same result for t.

Let me break this down. The original equation is 12 divided by t equals 4. That means when you divide 12 by t, you get 4. So, t must be a number that, when multiplied by 4, gives 12. Because division and multiplication are inverse operations. So if 12 ÷ t = 4, then t must be 12 ÷ 4, which is 3. So each room gets 3 rolls.

Now, I need to find another number sentence that also equals t. Let's look at the options provided.

Option A: 12 – t = 4. Hmm, if I solve for t here, 12 minus t equals 4, so t would be 12 - 4 = 8. That can't be right because we know t is 3, so this isn't correct.

Option B: 4 ÷ 12 = t. That would make t equal to 1/3, which is not right because each room needs 3 rolls.

Option C: 4 × t = 12. Let's solve this. 4 times t equals 12, so t is 12 ÷ 4, which is 3. That matches our earlier answer. So this seems correct.

Option D: t – 4 = 12. Solving for t, we add 4 to both sides, getting t = 16. That's way off, so no.

Option E: 4 + 12 = t. That would make t 16 again, which is wrong.

Option F: 4 – t = 12. Solving, we get t = 4 -12 = -8. Negative rolls don't make sense here, so no.

Option G: t + 4 = 12. Solving, t is 8. Again, not 3, so wrong.

Option H: t ÷ 4 = 12. That would mean t is 48, which is way too high.

So, the only option that gives t as 3 is option C: 4 × t = 12. That makes sense because if you multiply the number of rolls per room (t) by the number of rooms (4), you get the total rolls, which is 12. So, that's the correct alternative number sentence.

The correct alternative number sentence is 4 × t = 12, which also gives t = 3.
