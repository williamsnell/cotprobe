Okay, so I've got this question about the maximum value of the z-component of the spin angular momentum for a 43Ca nucleus. Hmm, I remember that spin angular momentum relates to quantum mechanics, specifically the spin of a particle. The question gives me I = 7/2, which I think is the nuclear spin quantum number. 

Wait, the nucleus's spin is given by I, right? So for 43Ca, I is 7/2. Now, the spin angular momentum has components, and the z-component is what they're asking about. The maximum value... Oh, right, the maximum z-component would be when the spin is aligned along the z-axis, so the projection is maximum.

I recall that the formula for the maximum z-component (m_I) is given by ħ multiplied by I, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. So ħ is approximately 1.0545718 × 10^-34 J·s. And since I is 7/2 here, I should calculate ħ * (7/2) to get the maximum m_I.

Let me do that. So 1.0545718e-34 J·s multiplied by 3.5 (since 7/2 is 3.5). Let me calculate that: 1.0545718 * 3.5. Hmm, 1.0545718 * 3 is 3.1637154, and 1.0545718 * 0.5 is 0.5272859. Adding them together gives about 3.6910013. So the product is approximately 3.691e-34 J·s.

Wait, but looking at the options, option I is 3.691 x 10^-34 J s. But wait, is that the maximum? Because I thought the formula is m_I * ħ, but m_I can be from -I to +I in integer steps. So the maximum m_I is +I, which is 7/2. So yes, the maximum z-component is ħ*(7/2).

But wait, I just did that and got 3.691e-34, which is option I. But looking at the options again, option A is 10.492e-34, which is much larger. Did I miss a factor?

Wait, no, perhaps I made a mistake. Wait, ħ is 1.0545718e-34 J·s. Multiply by 7/2: 1.0545718 * 7 = 7.3819926e-34, then divided by 2, so 3.6909963e-34, yes, so 3.691e-34. That's option I. But wait, the question is about the maximum value of the z-component. Oh wait, no, maybe I'm confusing the total spin angular momentum with the z-component. The total spin is ħ√(I(I+1)), but the z-component is m_I * ħ. So the maximum z-component is when m_I is +I, so yes, it's (7/2) * ħ.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is 10.492e-34. Let me compute 1.0545718e-34 * 7/2. Let me do it again: 1.0545718 * 7 = 7.3819926, divided by 2 is 3.6909963e-34. So that's option I.

Wait, but wait, 43Ca is a calcium isotope. I think calcium-43 has a spin of I=7/2, which I've used. So the maximum m_I is 7/2, so the maximum z-component is ħ*(7/2), which is about 3.691e-34 J·s, which is option I.

Wait, but looking at the options again, option I is 3.691e-34, which matches what I calculated. So the correct answer should be I.

The maximum value of the z-component of the spin angular momentum occurs when the spin is aligned along the z-axis, corresponding to the quantum number \( m_I = I \). For \( ^{43}\text{Ca} \), the nuclear spin quantum number is \( I = \frac{7}{2} \). Using the formula for the z-component of spin angular momentum, \( S_z = \hbar \cdot m_I \), where \( \hbar = 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \), the maximum \( S_z \) is:

\[
S_z = \hbar \cdot \frac{7}{2} = (1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}) \cdot 3.5 = 3.691 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}.
\]

This matches option I.
