Okay, so I have this question about the maximum efficiency of a steam engine. Hmm, I remember from my physics classes that steam engines are a type of heat engine, right? And heat engines operate between two temperatures: a hot reservoir and a cold reservoir. The maximum efficiency they can achieve is given by the Carnot efficiency, which is the theoretical maximum for any engine operating between those two temperatures.

The question gives the input steam temperature as 175°C and the exhaust as 75°C. Wait, but I think the Carnot efficiency formula uses absolute temperatures, measured in Kelvin. Oh right, because Kelvin is an absolute scale where zero is the lowest possible temperature. So I need to convert both temperatures from Celsius to Kelvin.

To convert Celsius to Kelvin, I just add 273.15. So for the input temperature, 175°C plus 273.15 equals... let me calculate that. 175 + 273 is 448, and then adding 0.15 makes it 448.15 K. For the exhaust temperature, 75°C plus 273.15 is 348.15 K.

Now, the Carnot efficiency formula is (1 - Tc/Th), where Tc is the temperature of the cold reservoir and Th is the hot reservoir. So plugging in the values, it would be 1 minus (348.15 / 448.15). Let me compute that division first. 348.15 divided by 448.15. Hmm, let's see. 348 divided by 448 is approximately 0.777, but let me get more precise.

348.15 ÷ 448.15 ≈ 0.777. So then 1 - 0.777 is about 0.223. To convert that to a percentage, I multiply by 100, which gives 22.3%. So the maximum efficiency should be around 22.3%.

Looking at the options, option G is 22.3%, so I think that's the correct answer. Let me just double-check my calculations. Wait, 175°C is 448.15 K and 75°C is 348.15 K. The ratio is 348.15/448.15. Let me compute it more accurately. 

348.15 ÷ 448.15: 448.15 goes into 348.15 how many times? Wait, actually, 348.15 is less than 448.15, so the ratio is less than 1. Let's compute it step by step. 

Let me use a calculator approach.

448.15 × 0.77 = 448.15 *0.7=313.705, 448.15*0.07=31.3705. Adding them gives 345.0755. Hmm, that's close to 348.15. So 0.77 gives about 345.08. The difference is 348.15 -345.08=3.07. So maybe 0.77 plus a bit more. Let's see, 448.15 × 0.777 = 448.15*(0.7 + 0.07 + 0.007). 

Wait, perhaps it's easier to just compute 348.15 / 448.15. Let me divide 348.15 by 448.15.

Dividing both numerator and denominator by 100 gives 3.4815 / 4.4815 ≈ 0.777. So yes, the ratio is approximately 0.777. So 1 - 0.777 = 0.223, which is 22.3%. So option G is correct.

I don't think I made any mistakes here. The key steps were converting to Kelvin and applying the Carnot formula correctly. So the answer should be G.

The maximum efficiency of a steam engine is determined by the Carnot efficiency formula, which requires converting the given temperatures to Kelvin. The input temperature of 175°C becomes 448.15 K, and the exhaust temperature of 75°C becomes 348.15 K. Using the formula \(1 - \frac{T_c}{T_h}\), where \(T_c = 348.15 \, \text{K}\) and \(T_h = 448.15 \, \text{K}\), the efficiency is calculated as \(1 - \frac{348.15}{448.15} \approx 22.3\%\).
