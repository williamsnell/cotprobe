Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this economics question about the market for roses. Let me break it down. 

The question says that the market is currently in equilibrium. So, that means the supply and demand curves intersect at a certain price and quantity. Now, two things happen: the supply of roses falls, and the demand for roses rises. I need to figure out what happens to the price and quantity after these changes.

First, I remember that when supply decreases, the supply curve shifts left. This usually leads to a higher equilibrium price because there's less supply to meet the existing demand. At the same time, a higher price might lead to a lower quantity demanded, but since the supply is also less, the exact effect on quantity isn't immediately clear.

On the other hand, when demand increases, the demand curve shifts right. This typically causes both the equilibrium price and quantity to rise. So higher demand would push the price up and increase the quantity sold.

Now, putting both changes together: supply falls (left shift) and demand rises (right shift). Both changes are in the same direction regarding price—they both tend to increase it. So the new equilibrium price is definitely higher than before. But what about quantity?

When supply decreases, the quantity supplied at the original price would be lower. When demand increases, the quantity demanded at the original price would be higher. So the new equilibrium quantity could go either way. It depends on how much each curve shifts. If the shift in demand is bigger, quantity might rise. If the shift in supply is bigger, quantity might fall. But since both shifts are happening in opposite directions in terms of quantity (supply down, demand up), it's ambiguous whether the quantity will rise or fall.

So the price definitely rises because both shifts push it up. But the quantity change isn't clear—it could go up or down depending on the relative shifts. Looking at the options, option E says "Price rises, but the change in quantity is ambiguous." That fits because price definitely goes up, but quantity isn't certain.

When both supply decreases and demand increases, the equilibrium price rises, but the quantity change is uncertain. 

Answer: E
