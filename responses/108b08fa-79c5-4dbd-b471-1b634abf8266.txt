Question:

During a study of renal glomeruli, a healthy animal kidney is kept in a vascular bath preparation at a constant afferent arterial pressure of 100 mm Hg. If the efferent arteriole is constricted with a vascular clamp, which of the following Starling forces is most likely to change in the glomeruli?

Options:

A: Increased filtration coefficient (Kf)
B: Increased hydrostatic pressure
C: Increased blood flow
D: Increased oncotic pressure
E: Decreased hydrostatic pressure
F: No change in Starling forces
G: Decreased oncotic pressure
H: Decreased filtration coefficient (Kf)

Answer:

Okay, so I've got this question about renal glomeruli and Starling forces. Hmm, I remember that the glomeruli are the tiny structures in the kidney where filtration happens. The question involves a healthy animal kidney kept in a vascular bath, which probably means it's isolated and being perfused with a solution, maintaining certain conditions.

The setup says the afferent arterial pressure is kept constant at 100 mm Hg. Then, the efferent arteriole is constricted with a clamp. I think constriction of the efferent arteriole would increase resistance in that vessel. Let me recall what happens when efferent arteriole resistance increases.

Oh right, in normal conditions, the efferent arteriole's resistance is what determines the pressure within the glomerulus. When it's constricted, the resistance goes up. This causes the blood to flow through the glomerulus more, increasing the pressure inside the glomerular capillaries. Because the blood is under higher pressure, more fluid is pushed out into the Bowman's capsule—wait, but how does this affect Starling forces?

Starling forces are the factors that determine the movement of fluid across the glomerular membrane. The main factors are hydrostatic pressure, oncotic pressure, and the filtration coefficient (which is about the permeability and surface area). The formula is: Filtration = Kf (P_glo - P_on - Π_on), where P_glo is the glomerular hydrostatic pressure, P_on is the hydrostatic pressure in the capsule (which I think is atmospheric pressure, so maybe around zero), and Π_on is the oncotic pressure on the other side.

So, when the efferent arteriole is constricted, the afferent pressure is still 100 mm Hg, but the resistance downstream is higher. By Poiseuille's law, higher resistance would increase the pressure drop across the glomerulus. So the glomerular capillary pressure (P_glo) increases because the blood is under more pressure as it's forced through the constricted efferent side.

An increase in P_glo would mean that the hydrostatic pressure driving filtration increases. The oncotic pressure (on both sides) might not change immediately because it's related to protein concentration, which probably doesn't change quickly unless there's time for proteins to redistribute, but in this scenario, it's a quick change. So the main change is the hydrostatic pressure.

Looking at the options, B is increased hydrostatic pressure. E is decreased, but that doesn't make sense because the afferent is high and efferent is constricted. So B is the likely answer. Other options: C is increased blood flow, but in the glomerulus, I think the flow might increase but that's a result of the pressure changes. The question is about Starling forces, which are about the pressures and Kf.

Wait, does constriction of the efferent arteriole affect the filtration coefficient? I think Kf could stay the same because it's about the structure, not the pressure. So A and H are about Kf, but the question is about which Starling force changes. So the main change is increased hydrostatic pressure in the glomerulus.

So the answer should be B: Increased hydrostatic pressure.

When the efferent arteriole is constricted, the resistance in that vessel increases, leading to a higher pressure drop across the glomerulus. This results in an increase in the glomerular capillary pressure (P_glo), which is a key Starling force driving filtration. While other factors like blood flow or oncotic pressure might be affected, the question specifically asks about the change in Starling forces, making the increased hydrostatic pressure the most relevant change.

Answer: B
