Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a collision between two particles. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question says it's a nonrelativistic, one-dimensional collision. So I don't have to worry about relativistic effects, which is good because that's complicated. The setup is that a particle of mass 2m collides with another particle of mass m that's initially at rest. After the collision, they stick together, so it's a perfectly inelastic collision. I need to find out what fraction of the initial kinetic energy is lost.

Alright, I remember that in collisions, both momentum and kinetic energy are conserved, but wait—no, actually, in perfectly inelastic collisions, kinetic energy isn't conserved because some of it is lost as heat or other forms. But momentum is always conserved. So I should start by applying the conservation of momentum to find the final velocity, and then calculate the kinetic energies before and after to find the loss.

Let me jot down what I know. The initial mass of the first particle is 2m, and its initial velocity is let's say u. The second particle has mass m and is at rest, so its initial velocity is 0. After the collision, they stick together, so the combined mass is 2m + m = 3m, and their velocity will be some v.

Using conservation of momentum: the total initial momentum equals the total final momentum. So,

Initial momentum = (2m) * u + m * 0 = 2m u.

Final momentum = (3m) * v.

So, 2m u = 3m v. I can cancel m from both sides, getting 2u = 3v, so v = (2u)/3.

Now, I need to find the initial and final kinetic energies. The initial KE is just the KE of the moving particle, since the other is at rest.

Initial KE = (1/2)(2m)u² = m u².

Final KE is the KE of the combined mass moving at v.

Final KE = (1/2)(3m)v². Substituting v = (2u)/3, so v² = (4u²)/9.

Plugging that in: (1/2)(3m)(4u²/9) = (1/2)(3m)(4u²/9) = (1/2)( (12 m u²) /9 ) = (1/2)(4 m u² /3) )= (2 m u²)/3.

Wait, so the initial KE was m u², and the final is (2/3)m u². So the kinetic energy lost is initial minus final: m u² - (2/3) m u² = (1/3) m u².

Wait, that would mean the energy lost is (1/3) m u². But to find the fraction lost, I take (lost KE) / (initial KE). So that's (1/3 m u²) / (m u²) )= 1/3.

Wait, but looking at the options, G is 1/3. But wait, wait a second. Let me check my calculations again because sometimes I might have messed up the fractions.

Wait, when I calculated the final KE, let me go through that again.

Final KE = (1/2) * (3m) * ( (2u/3) )².

So (2u/3) squared is 4u²/9. Then multiply by 3m: 3m * 4u²/9 = (12 m u²)/9 = 4 m u²/3. Then half of that is 2 m u²/3. Yes, correct.

So initial KE is m u², final is 2/3 m u². So the loss is m u² - (2/3) m u² = (1/3) m u². So the fraction lost is (1/3 m u²) / (m u²) )= 1/3. So the answer would be G: 1/3.

Wait, but I've seen some similar problems where the fraction lost is 1/4 or something else. Did I make a mistake somewhere?

Wait, let me consider the masses again. The initial mass is 2m moving, and m at rest. After collision, the combined mass is 3m. So the velocities after collision are correct.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the velocities and kinetic energies again. Alternatively, maybe I can use the formula for kinetic energy loss in a perfectly inelastic collision, which is given by ( (2 m1 m2) / (m1 + m2)² ) * u², where u is the initial velocity of the moving mass.

So plugging in m1=2m, m2=m, u is the initial velocity of m1.

So KE loss = (2*(2m)*m) / ( (2m + m)^2 ) * u² = (4 m²) / (9 m²) * u² = (4/9) u² m.

Wait, but initial KE is (1/2)(2m)u² = m u². So the fraction lost would be (4/9 m u²) / (m u²) )= 4/9. But 4/9 is not one of the options. Hmm, that's conflicting with my earlier calculation. So I must have messed up.

Wait, wait no, perhaps the formula I'm recalling is for when one mass is moving and the other is at rest. Let me double-check that formula.

The formula for the kinetic energy loss in a perfectly inelastic collision is:

ΔKE = [ (2 m1 m2) / (m1 + m2) ] * (u²) * (1/2) ?

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing different formulas. Let me think differently.

The initial KE is (1/2)(2m)u² = m u².

After collision, the velocity is v = (2m u)/(3m) )= 2u/3.

So final KE is (1/2)(3m)( (2u/3)^2 )= (1/2)(3m)(4u²/9) )= (1/2)( (12 m u²)/9 )= (1/2)(4 m u²/3 )= 2 m u²/3.

So initial KE = m u², final KE = (2/3) m u². So the loss is m u² - (2/3) m u² = (1/3) m u².

So the fraction lost is (1/3 m u²)/(m u²) )= 1/3. So the answer should be G: 1/3.

But wait, earlier when I used the formula I thought the loss was 4/9. Where did I go wrong? Oh, because perhaps I misapplied the formula. Let me double-check that formula.

The kinetic energy loss ΔKE is ( (m1 m2 (u)^2 ) ) / (2 (m1 + m2) )) * (4 m1 m2)/(m1 + m2)^2 ? Wait, no, I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, the formula for the loss can be derived as follows:

ΔKE = KE_initial - KE_final = [ (1/2) m1 u² + (1/2)m2 v2² ] - [ (1/2)(m1 + m2) v² ]

But since m2 is initially at rest, v2=0. So,

ΔKE = (1/2) m1 u² - (1/2)(m1 + m2) v².

But v is found from conservation of momentum: m1 u = (m1 + m2) v → v = (m1 u)/(m1 + m2).

So substituting,

ΔKE = (1/2) m1 u² - (1/2)(m1 + m2) [ (m1 u)/(m1 + m2) ) ]²

= (1/2) m1 u² - (1/2) (m1² u²)/(m1 + m2)

= (1/2) m1 u² [ 1 - (m1)/(m1 + m2) ) ]

Wait, 1 - [m1/(m1 + m2)] = [ (m1 + m2) - m1 ]/(m1 + m2) )= m2/(m1 + m2).

So,

ΔKE = (1/2) m1 u² * [ m2/(m1 + m2) ) ].

So,

ΔKE = (1/2) m1 m2 u² / (m1 + m2).

Wait, so in this case, m1=2m, m2=m.

So,

ΔKE = (1/2)(2m)(m) u² / (2m + m) )= (1/2)(2m² u²)/ (3m )= (m² u²) / (3m )= (m u²)/3.

Which matches my earlier calculation. So the loss is (1/3) m u². So the fraction is 1/3.

So the answer should be G: 1/3.

The problem involves a perfectly inelastic collision between two particles in a one-dimensional, nonrelativistic setup. A particle of mass \(2m\) collides with a stationary particle of mass \(m\), and they stick together after the collision. To determine the fraction of the initial kinetic energy lost, we apply the principles of conservation of momentum and the formulas for kinetic energy.

### Step 1: Conservation of Momentum
The initial momentum is carried only by the moving particle:
\[
\text{Initial Momentum} = (2m)u
\]
After the collision, the combined mass is \(3m\), and the final velocity \(v\) is:
\[
2m u = 3m v \implies v = \frac{2u}{3}
\]

### Step 2: Kinetic Energies
- **Initial Kinetic Energy**: Only the moving particle contributes:
\[
KE_{\text{initial}} = \frac{1}{2}(2m)u^2 = m u^2
\]
- **Final Kinetic Energy**: The combined mass moves at velocity \(v\):
\[
KE_{\text{final}} = \frac{1}{2}(3m)\left(\frac{2u}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{2}(3m)\frac{4u^2}{9} = \frac{2}{3}m u^2
\]

### Step 3: Energy Loss
The kinetic energy lost is:
\[
\Delta KE = KE_{\text{initial}} - KE_{\text{final}} = m u^2 - \frac{2}{3}m u^2 = \frac{1}{3}m u^2
\]
The fraction of the initial kinetic energy lost is:
\[
\frac{\Delta KE}{KE_{\text{initial}}} = \frac{\frac{1}{3}m u^2}{m u^2} = \frac{1}{3}
\]

Thus, the fraction of the initial kinetic energy lost is **1/3**, corresponding to option **G**.
