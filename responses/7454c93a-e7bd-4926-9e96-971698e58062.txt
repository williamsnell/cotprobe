Okay, so I have this question about where the world's first civilization developed, and I need to choose the correct answer from the options given. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that the concept of a civilization typically involves complex societies with things like writing, agriculture, urban centers, and organized governments. The earliest known civilizations are often referred to as the cradles of civilization.

I recall learning about several ancient civilizations. There's Mesopotamia, which is often called the "Cradle of Civilization." Mesopotamia is located between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers in what is now Iraq. They were known for their cuneiform writing, which is one of the earliest forms of writing.

Then there's Egypt, which is another ancient civilization along the Nile River. The Egyptians developed hieroglyphs and had a very structured society. But wait, when was Mesopotamia's civilization compared to Egypt's? I think Mesopotamia's civilization developed a bit earlier, maybe around 3500 BCE, while Egypt's was around 3100 BCE. So Mesopotamia might be the first.

Looking at the options, I see both A (Egypt) and J (Mesopotamia) as possibilities. The question is about the first, so if Mesopotamia is earlier, then J would be the answer.

Other options like Crete (I) is Minoan civilization, which was around 3000 BCE, so after Mesopotamia. North America (C) and South America (D) have indigenous civilizations, but they developed much later, around the first millennium CE or later. Eastern China (E) has the Yellow River civilization, the Xia Dynasty, which is around 2000 BCE, so also after Mesopotamia.

Western Europe (B), Australia (F), and Southern India (H) didn't have civilizations as early as Mesopotamia. So the earliest is likely Mesopotamia.

The world's first civilization developed in Mesopotamia, often referred to as the "Cradle of Civilization," located between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers. This region is credited with the earliest known writing system, cuneiform, and the development of complex societal structures. While other regions like Egypt and China later developed advanced societies, Mesopotamia's civilization predates them.

Answer: J
