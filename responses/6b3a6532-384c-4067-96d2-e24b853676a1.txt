Okay, so I need to figure out the answer to this multiple-choice question based on the passage provided. Let me read through it carefully and try to understand what's going on.

The passage is a excerpt from a book by Roland Doregelès, written around 1965, titled "After 50 Years." The scene described is in a newspaper office where the narrator receives a message about an upcoming mobilization for war. A passerby informs him that the first day of mobilization is Sunday, August 2, 1914. The narrator rushes to Rue Drout, reads the message, and then returns to the office of Georges Clemenceau, their chief.

When the narrator bursts into Clemenceau's office, Clemenceau asks, "What is Paris saying?" The narrator responds, "It's singing, sir!" Clemenceau then says, "It will be all right then."

So, the question is asking what we can infer about Clemenceau's reaction based on his response. The options are A through J, each suggesting a different inference.

Let me break down the key elements:

1. The narrator is exhilarated by the news of war, as he's dead tired but still excited.
2. He goes to Clemenceau's office to inform him. Clemenceau asks about Paris's reaction.
3. The narrator says Paris is singing, indicating a positive, joyful reaction.
4. Clemenceau responds, "It will be all right then."

So, Clemenceau's response seems positive. He's reassured by the fact that Paris is reacting joyfully to the news of war. His reply suggests that if the public is responding well, things will be okay. 

Looking at the options:

A: Had already started making strategies. The passage doesn't mention anything about strategies, just his reaction to the public's response.

B: Disagreed with the public's reaction. No, because he says "It will be all right," implying he's in agreement or relieved by the positive reaction.

C: Was unaware until informed. But the narrator went to his office to tell him, so perhaps Clemenceau didn't know yet. But the passage doesn't explicitly say Clemenceau didn't know; maybe he did, but the key is his reaction to the news.

D: Grave doubts about France's ability to win. His response doesn't indicate doubt; instead, it seems hopeful.

E: Fearful of the consequences. Again, his response is positive, so probably not.

F: Relieved to hear Paris is reacting with joy. This seems likely because his response is positive, indicating that the public's joy makes him feel it's okay.

G: Would serve as PM. The passage doesn't mention his future role, so irrelevant.

H: War would bring prosperity. No indication of economic aspects here.

I: Indifferent to Paris's reaction. No, he specifically asked about it and reacted.

J: Disgusted by Paris's reaction. No, his response is positive.

So, the best inference is F: Clemenceau was relieved to hear that Paris was reacting with joy.

The passage describes Clemenceau's reaction to the news of mobilization and Paris's joyful response. His reply, "It will be all right then," indicates relief and approval of the public's positive reaction. Therefore, the correct inference is that Clemenceau was relieved.

F
