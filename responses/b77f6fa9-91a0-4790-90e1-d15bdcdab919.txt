Question:

As part of an externship program conducted by his law school, a law student went to work for a lawyer as a clerk. After six months, the lawyer was very impressed with the law student's work. He called the law student into his office and told him, "I know you were only to work for me for six months in exchange for credit in your law school extemship program. However, I'd like you to stay on as a clerk. I'll pay you $25 an hour for any work you do for me between now and the bar exam. In addition, if you put in a minimum of 10 hours per week during that time, I promise to hire you full-time as an associate when you pass the bar exam. " The attorney then reduced this agreement to writing, which both he and the law student signed. The law student continued to work for the lawyer throughout the rest of his law school career and while he was studying for the bar exam. During that time, the law student always worked a minimum of 10 hours per week. While the law student was awaiting the results of the bar exam, his uncle passed away and left him a large apartment building. The law student decided he did not want to practice law but wanted to spend all of his time managing the apartment building. He told his roommate, a fellow law student who was awaiting his bar results, about his plans and told the roommate he would assign to the roommate the right to be hired by the lawyer as an associate, in exchange for $100. The roommate paid the $100 to the law student, who then executed a written assignment of the right to be hired by the lawyer as an associate. The roommate passed the bar exam, but the lawyer refused to hire him as an associate. Which of the following is the most accurate statement regarding the legal effect of this assignment?

Options:

A: The lawyer would be required to recognize the validity of the assignment, because the roommate passed the bar exam and is therefore qualified.
B: The lawyer would not be required to recognize the validity of the assignment, because neither the rights nor the duties under a personal service contract are properly assignable.
C: The lawyer would not be required to recognize the validity of the assignment, because the original contract was between the lawyer and the law student, not the roommate.
D: The lawyer would be required to recognize the validity of the assignment, but would be entitled to demand adequate assurances of performance from the roommate as to the latter's willingness and professional capacity to perform satisfactory work.
E: The lawyer would be required to recognize the validity of the assignment, but only if the roommate can prove he is capable of performing the duties of an associate.
F: The lawyer would not be required to recognize the validity of the assignment, because the original agreement was not intended to be assignable.
G: The lawyer would not be required to recognize the validity of the assignment, because the assignment was made in exchange for money, altering the original terms of the agreement.
H: The lawyer would be required to recognize the validity of the assignment, but would be entitled to demand adequate assurances of performance from the roommate as to the latter's willingness and financial capacity to perform satisfactory work.
I: The lawyer would not be required to recognize the validity of the assignment of rights, because a contract to make a future assignment of a right is not an assignment.
J: The lawyer would be required to recognize the validity of the assignment so that the roommate would be entitled to be hired as an associate.

Okay, I need to tackle this legal question about contract assignments. Let me read through the scenario carefully and break it down.

So, there's a law student who worked as a clerk for a lawyer under an externship program. The lawyer offered him a part-time job at $25/hour until the bar exam, with a promise to hire him full-time as an associate if he worked at least 10 hours a week. They put this agreement in writing and both signed it. The student worked all through law school and study period, always meeting the 10-hour minimum. 

Then, after passing the bar exam results, the student's uncle died, leaving him an apartment building. He decided he didn't want to practice law anymore and wanted to manage the building. He told his roommate, another law student awaiting bar results, that he'd assign the right to be hired as an associate in exchange for $100. The roommate paid the money, and the student executed a written assignment. The roommate passed the bar, but the lawyer refused to hire him.

The question is about the legal effect of this assignment. The options are A to J.

First, I need to understand what kind of contract this is. The lawyer promised to hire the student as an associate upon passing the bar, which is a conditional promise based on the student's continued performance (working 10 hours a week). This sounds like a personal service contract because it's based on the individual's performance and skills.

I remember that personal service contracts, like those involving professional services, are generally not assignable. The reasoning is that the service provider's personal skills, reputation, or qualifications are key to the contract. Assigning such a right would change the nature of the contract because the new person might not have the same abilities or qualities the original party had.

In this case, the assignment was from the law student to his roommate. The original agreement was between the lawyer and the student. The roommate, even though he passed the bar, is a different person. The lawyer probably didn't agree to this assignment, so the question is whether it's enforceable without their consent.

Looking at the options:

Option B says the lawyer isn't required to recognize the assignment because neither the rights nor duties are assignable in a personal service contract. That makes sense because the contract is personal to the student.

Option C also mentions the original contract was between the lawyer and the student, not the roommate, so the assignment isn't valid. That's another angle, but I think the main reason is the personal nature of the contract, not just the parties involved.

Options A, D, E, F, G, H, I, J all suggest some form of recognition or conditions, but the key here is whether the assignment is valid at all. Since it's a personal service contract, assignment is typically not allowed without consent.

So, the most accurate statement would be B: the lawyer isn't required to recognize the assignment because the contract's rights and duties aren't assignable.

The scenario involves a personal service contract between the lawyer and the law student, which is based on the student's personal skills and performance. Such contracts are generally not assignable because they rely on the individual's unique abilities. The assignment of the right to be hired by the lawyer as an associate to the roommate, without the lawyer's consent, is not valid. Therefore, the lawyer is not obligated to recognize the assignment.

Answer: B
