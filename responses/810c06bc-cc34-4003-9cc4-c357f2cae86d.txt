Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about reaction rates and photochemical smog. Hmm, I remember that photochemical smog involves reactions between NO and O2, right? The question is about finding the rate expression for the reaction 2NO + O2 → 2NO2.

The problem states that when the initial concentration of O2 is doubled while keeping NO constant, the initial reaction rate doubles. Also, when NO is doubled and O2 is held constant, the rate quadruples. I need to figure out the rate law based on this information.

I think the rate law is generally expressed as rate = k [NO]^m [O2]^n, where m and n are the orders with respect to NO and O2 respectively. My goal is to find the values of m and n.

From the first condition: doubling [O2] doubles the rate. So if I write the rate equation before and after, let's see. Suppose initially, the rate is k [NO]^m [O2]^n. When [O2] is doubled, new rate is k [NO]^m (2[O2])^n. The new rate is 2 times the original rate. So:

k [NO]^m (2[O2})^n = 2 * k [NO]^m [O2]^n

Divide both sides by k [NO]^m [O2]^n:

2^n = 2

So 2^n = 2 implies n=1. So the order with respect to O2 is 1.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, when O2 is doubled, rate doubles. So if the rate is proportional to [O2]^n, then 2^n = 2 → n=1. Yeah, that makes sense.

Now the second condition: doubling [NO] quadruples the rate. So, original rate is k [NO]^m [O2]^n. When [NO] is doubled, rate becomes k (2[NO})^m [O2]^n. And this equals 4 times the original rate.

So:

k (2[NO})^m [O2]^n = 4 * k [NO]^m [O2]^n

Divide both sides by k [NO]^m [O2]^n:

2^m =4 → 2^m=2^2 → m=2.

So the order with respect to NO is 2.

Putting it together, the rate expression is rate = k [NO]^2 [O2]^1, which is k [NO]^2 [O2].

Wait, but looking at the options, option G is rate = k [NO]^2 [O2]^2, but that would have n=2. Wait, did I make a mistake?

Wait no, earlier I found that n=1 because doubling O2 doubled the rate. So options: option G is [NO]^2 [O2]^2, which would mean n=2, but that's not what we found.

Wait, let me double-check. First condition: [O2] doubles, rate doubles. So the rate is first order in O2. So n=1.

Second condition: [NO] doubles, rate quadruples. So that's 2^m =4 → m=2. So rate is [NO]^2 [O2]^1, so rate = k [NO]^2 [O2].

Looking at the options, which one matches this? Let's see the options:

Option E: [NO]^2 [O2]^2 → n=2, m=2. No.

Option G: [NO]^2 [O2] → yes, that's m=2, n=1. So option G.

Wait, but option G is "G: rate = k [NO]^2 [O_2]". So that should be the correct answer.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't confuse anything. The reaction is 2NO + O2 → 2NO2. The rate law doesn't necessarily have to match the stoichiometry because the rate law is determined experimentally, so the order can be different. So the rate is [NO]^2 [O2], so yes, option G.
</think>

The reaction 2NO + O2 → 2NO2 is studied kinetically. When the concentration of O2 is doubled while keeping NO constant, the reaction rate doubles, indicating that the reaction is first-order with respect to O2 (n = 1). When the concentration of NO is doubled while keeping O2 constant, the reaction rate quadruples, indicating that the reaction is second-order with respect to NO (m = 2). Thus, the rate expression is rate = k [NO]^2 [O2]. Comparing this with the options, the correct choice is G.

Answer: G
