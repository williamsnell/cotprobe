Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this medical question. Let me read through it again carefully.

The patient is a 75-year-old woman with band-like, burning pain in her right upper abdomen. The pain starts in the epigastrium and goes around to the midline of the back. Physical exam shows no tenderness when palpated. The gallbladder ultrasound is normal, and her serum amylase is within the reference range. The options are from A to I.

First, I'll consider the symptoms. The pain is in the right upper abdomen, which makes me think of the gallbladder or maybe the appendix. But wait, the pain is also radiating to the back, which is a bit unusual for appendicitis. Appendicitis usually presents with periumbilical pain that later localizes to the lower right abdomen, not really the back.

The ultrasound of the gallbladder is normal, so gallstones (option A) might not be the answer, but I'm not sure because sometimes gallstones can cause pain without showing up on ultrasound, or maybe she has cholecystitis without stones (acalculous). But the amylase is normal, which doesn't point to pancreatitis, so that's not it.

She doesn't have tenderness on exam, which is interesting. If it were appendicitis, she might have tenderness in the lower abdomen. But the pain is upper, so maybe not appendicitis (option F). The pain description is burning and band-like, which makes me think of something like a belt around the upper abdomen and back. That sounds a bit like pancreatitis, but her amylase is normal, so that's less likely.

Another thought: herpes zoster (option D). Shingles can cause a band of pain along the nerve distribution. The right upper abdomen and back might be consistent with the thoracic dermatomes. But wait, the pain is burning, which fits, but usually, shingles also presents with a rash. If the patient doesn't have a rash, maybe it's postherpetic neuralgia, but that's more chronic. Or perhaps the rash hasn't developed yet. But the question doesn't mention a rash, so I'm not sure.

Looking at the other options: Gastric cancer (B) can cause upper abdominal pain, but it's usually more vague and might not radiate to the back. Peptic Ulcer Disease (C) typically causes pain in the upper abdomen, possibly related to eating, but not usually radiating to the back. Irritable Bowel Syndrome (E) usually causes crampy腹痛, often in the lower abdomen, and not typically burning or band-like.

Diverticulitis of the cecum (H) can cause lower right abdominal pain, similar to appendicitis, and might present with tenderness there. But her pain is in the upper abdomen, so probably not.

Hepatitis C (I) can cause upper abdominal pain, but usually associated with other symptoms like jaundice, fatigue, and often tenderness. Her amylase is normal, which doesn't support hepatitis.

Acalculous cholecystitis (G) is an option because it can cause upper abdominal pain without stones. The pain is often in the right upper quadrant and can radiate to the back. Since the ultrasound is normal, it's possible she has acalculous cholecystitis. However, the absence of tenderness is confusing because cholecystitis usually causes some tenderness in the abdomen.

Wait, but the physical exam shows no tenderness. That's interesting. So if it's not appendicitis, what else? Gallstones with normal ultrasound might be possible, but she's 75 and gallstones are common, but the ultrasound is a good test for that. Maybe it's a false negative? Or perhaps it's functional pain.

Another thought: the pain is burning and band-like, which could be related to the diaphragm. Maybe a hiatal hernia? But that's not one of the options. Or maybe it's something else.

Alternatively, could it be a musculoskeletal issue? But the options don't include that.

Wait, the pain radiates from the epigastrium to the midline of the back. That pattern is similar to the distribution of the autonomic nerves, perhaps. Or maybe it's related to the gallbladder's C loop, which can cause pain around the back.

But considering the normal ultrasound and amylase, maybe it's a functional disorder like irritable bowel syndrome, but that's usually more chronic and not necessarily burning.

Alternatively, thinking about the pain as a result of something else. Maybe a gas issue or referred pain from another area.

Wait, the patient's age is 75. Could it be something like aortic dissection? But that's not an option here. Or maybe a kidney issue, but the options don't include that.

Alternatively, maybe it's a gallbladder issue but without stones. Acalculous cholecystitis (G) can cause pain similar to cholecystitis but without stones. It's more common in older patients and those with comorbidities. The pain would be in the right upper abdomen, possibly radiating to the back. But the lack of tenderness is confusing because acalculous cholecystitis usually presents with some tenderness.

Wait, but maybe the tenderness isn't there because it's not as severe or it's a different presentation. Or perhaps the pain is more chronic.

Another possibility: The pain could be due to the pancreas, but amylase is normal, so less likely.

Alternatively, could it be a duodenal ulcer? But again, the pain is usually in the epigastric area, but not necessarily radiating to the back.

Wait, the pain description is burning, which is more typical of esophageal issues, like GERD, but that's not an option here.

Looking back at the options, option D is Herpes zoster. If it's shingles, the pain would be along a dermatome, which could explain the band-like pain. The right upper abdomen and back might correspond to the distribution of the thoracic nerve. Shingles can cause severe pain without a rash initially, or perhaps the rash is not obvious or hasn't developed yet. However, usually, there's a rash that follows, but if the patient hasn't presented with it yet, maybe that's a consideration.

But the physical exam didn't mention a rash, so I'm not sure. Also, the absence of tenderness on exam would make me think less of an inflammatory process like appendicitis or cholecystitis.

Wait, the question says "burning pain." That's a common descriptor for both peptic ulcers and herpes zoster. But in the case of peptic ulcers, the pain is usually more in the epigastric area and might be associated with eating. The fact that it's radiating to the back makes me think of something else.

Alternatively, maybe it's a gallbladder issue but not stones. Acalculous cholecystitis can cause pain in the right upper quadrant, possibly radiating to the back. It's more common in older adults and can occur without stones, especially in those with comorbidities like diabetes or after surgery.

But again, the physical exam shows no tenderness, which is confusing. Maybe the pain is too diffuse to be localized, or the patient is not tender because it's not as severe.

Another angle: serum amylase is normal. If it were pancreatitis, the amylase would be elevated, so that's not it. Gallstones would usually not cause elevated amylase unless there's pancreatitis as well.

So considering all this, the most likely options are either Herpes zoster (D) or Acalculous cholecystitis (G). But the absence of tenderness makes me think less of cholecystitis, but maybe in some cases, it's less tender.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a different condition. Let's think about the options again.

Option G: Acalculous cholecystitis. The pain would be in the right upper abdomen, possibly radiating to the back. It can occur without stones, which fits the ultrasound being normal. However, the absence of tenderness is a bit confusing, but maybe it's just not as pronounced.

Option D: Herpes zoster. The pain is along a dermatome, which could explain the band-like pain from the epigastrium to the back. The burning nature fits. However, without a rash, it's less likely unless it's early in the presentation.

The question says the last character is the answer. Let me think about what's more likely. The patient is 75, which is a higher risk for gallbladder issues. But the ultrasound is normal, so maybe it's not gallstones. Acalculous cholecystitis can occur without stones, so that's possible.

Alternatively, if the pain is more of a neuralgia, then herpes zoster could be the answer. But without a rash, it's hard to say.

Wait, but the question says the pain is burning and band-like. That's more consistent with neuralgia, like shingles, but again, the absence of a rash is a problem.

Alternatively, maybe it's something else. Let me think about the other options again.

I think the correct answer is G: Acalculous cholecystitis. Because the pain is in the right upper abdomen, radiating to the back, and the ultrasound is normal. Acalculous cholecystitis can present without stones and cause such pain. The absence of tenderness might be due to the nature of the inflammation or the patient's age.

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, if it's not the gallbladder, maybe it's the diaphragm or something else.

Wait, another thought: The pain is from the epigastrium to the midline back. That's a bit unusual for most of the options. Maybe it's a GI issue, but I'm not sure.

I think I'll go with acalculous cholecystitis as the most likely diagnosis. So the answer is G.
</think>

The patient is a 75-year-old woman with band-like, burning pain in the right upper abdomen radiating to the midline of the back. The physical exam shows no tenderness, the gallbladder ultrasound is normal, and serum amylase is within the reference range. 

Considering the options:

- **Gallstones (A):** Unlikely because the ultrasound is normal, and gallstones typically cause gallbladder tenderness.
- **Gastric cancer (B):** Typically presents with vague upper abdominal pain, not radiating to the back.
- **Peptic Ulcer Disease (C):** Usually causes epigastric pain related to eating, not radiating to the back.
- **Herpes zoster (D):** Could explain the burning, band-like pain, but the absence of a rash makes it less likely.
- **Irritable Bowel Syndrome (E):** Causes crampy abdominal pain, not typically burning or radiating to the back.
- **Appendicitis (F):** Pain usually starts in the periumbilical area and moves to the lower right abdomen, not the upper abdomen or back.
- **Acalculous cholecystitis (G):** Fits the presentation with right upper abdominal pain radiating to the back, especially in older adults, even without stones on ultrasound.
- **Diverticulitis of the cecum (H):** Causes lower right abdominal pain, not upper.
- **Hepatitis C (I):** Typically presents with jaundice and tenderness, not this pain pattern.

The most likely diagnosis is **acalculous cholecystitis (G)** due to the pain pattern and patient age, despite the absence of tenderness.

Answer: G
