Question:

A man brought a federal diversity action against his insurance company, alleging that the company had breached its duty under his insurance policy by refusing to pay for his medical expenses resulting from a mountain-biking accident. At the jury trial, the man presented evidence that he had paid all premiums on the insurance policy and that the policy cov-ered personal-injury-related medical expenses arising from accidents. After he rested his case, the company presented evidence that a provision of the policy excluded payment for injury-related expenses resulting from an insured's Òunduly riskyÓ behavior. The company also presented a witness who testified that the accident had occurred in an area where posted signs warned bikers not to enter. The man did not cross-examine the witness. After resting its case, the company moved for judgment as a matter of law. Should the court grant the motion?

Options:

A: Yes, because the company's uncontradicted evidence of the man's unduly risky behavior means that no reason-able jury could find that the policy covers his injuries.
B: No, because the company did not provide sufficient evidence to prove that the man's behavior was unduly risky.
C: No, because the signs warning bikers not to enter were not part of the insurance policy.
D: No, because a motion for judgment as a matter of law must first be made at the close of the plaintiff's case-in-chief.
E: Yes, because the man failed to cross-examine the company's witness.
F: Yes, because the company provided evidence of a policy clause excluding unduly risky behavior.
G: Yes, because the man waived his right to rebut the company's evidence by not addressing the Òunduly riskyÓ policy provision in his case-in-chief.
H: No, because the man had paid all his premiums on the insurance policy.
I: No, because whether the man's behavior was unduly risky is a question of fact for the jury to resolve.
J: Yes, because the man did not provide sufficient evidence to prove that the company breached its duty.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the court should grant the insurance company's motion for judgment as a matter of law. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the case is a federal diversity action, which means it's a civil case where the parties are from different states, and the federal court has jurisdiction. The man is suing his insurance company because they refused to pay his medical expenses after a mountain-biking accident.

The man presented evidence that he paid all his premiums, and the policy covers personal-injury-related medical expenses from accidents. So, he's showing he fulfilled his part of the contract and that the policy should cover his expenses.

Then, the insurance company introduced a policy provision that excludes payment for injuries resulting from "unduly risky" behavior. They also had a witness testify that the accident happened in an area with signs warning bikers not to enter. The man didn't cross-examine this witness.

Now, the company moved for judgment as a matter of law (JMOL) after resting its case. I remember that a JMOL is appropriate when, after considering all the evidence in the light most favorable to the opposing party, no reasonable jury could find for the opposing side. The court should grant it only if the evidence is so clear that no reasonable jury could disagree.

Looking at the options:

Option A says yes because the company's evidence about unduly risky behavior means no reasonable jury could find coverage. But I'm not sure if the evidence alone is enough. The company presented a policy clause and a witness about the area, but does that definitively prove the behavior was unduly risky?

Option B says no because the company didn't provide enough evidence. Maybe the witness's testimony and the policy clause are sufficient, but sometimes it's about whether the evidence meets the standard of proof required. The company would need to show that the behavior was unduly risky by a preponderance of evidence?

Option C points out that the signs weren't part of the policy, but the company's witness's testimony about the signs is separate from the policy. The policy just has the exclusion, so the signs might be evidence to show the behavior was unduly risky.

Option D says no because the motion wasn't made at the close of the plaintiff's case. Wait, when is JMOL made? I think in federal court, a JMOL can be made after the plaintiff rests their case (at the close of their case-in-chief) and again at the close of all evidence. The company made it after resting their case, so maybe D is not correct because the timing might not be the issue here.

Option E suggests yes because the man didn't cross-examine the witness. But failure to cross-examine doesn't automatically mean the evidence is accepted as true. The opposing party can still present their case, and the court considers all evidence. So E might not be right.

Option F says yes because the company provided evidence of the policy clause. But having the clause alone doesn't automatically exclude coverage unless the clause was triggered. The company needs to prove that the man's behavior was unduly risky, not just that the clause exists.

Option G claims yes because the man waived his right to rebut by not addressing the provision in his case-in-chief. Waiver usually requires that the issue was raised and the party didn't respond. But here, the company introduced evidence during their case. The man didn't have to address it in his case-in-chief; he could present his defense after the company's case. So G might not be correct.

Option H says no because he paid all premiums. But paying premiums doesn't necessarily mean the company must cover all claims; it depends on the policy terms. So H is probably incorrect.

Option I says no because whether the behavior was unduly risky is a question for the jury. That makes sense because it's a factual determination. The court shouldn't decide that; the jury should. So if the company's evidence is conflicting or could lead to different interpretations, the jury should decide.

Option J says yes because the man didn't prove breach of duty. But the man showed he paid premiums and that the policy covers certain expenses. The company's defense is based on an exclusion, so the breach would depend on whether the exclusion applies. The man might have enough to go to the jury on whether the company properly applied the policy.

Putting it together, the key issue is whether the evidence shows that the man's behavior was unduly risky. The company's witness testified about the warning signs, but that's just one factor. Whether the behavior was unduly risky is a factual question. The court shouldn't take that away from the jury. Therefore, the motion should be denied because it's a question of fact. So the answer is I.

The court should not grant the motion for judgment as a matter of law because whether the man's behavior was unduly risky is a question of fact for the jury to resolve. The insurance company presented evidence of a policy exclusion and a witness's testimony about warning signs, but these are factual issues that require jury determination. Therefore, the motion should be denied.
