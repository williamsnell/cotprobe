Okay, so I've got this question about recording maturity dates for drafts, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see, the question has four parts, a to d, each with a different date and terms. I need to figure out the maturity date for each and then match them to the options given from A to J.

First, I'll tackle part a: November 12 and payable 60 days after date. So the draft is dated November 12, and it's payable in 60 days. To find the maturity date, I just need to add 60 days to November 12. Let me count the days. November has 30 days, so from November 12, adding 60 days would go through November and then into December. 

November 12 to November 30 is 19 days (including the 12th?), wait no, if I'm adding days, I think I should count the days after the 12th. So November has 30 days, so 30 -12 = 18 days left in November. So from November 12, adding 18 days brings me to November 30. Then I have 60-18=42 days left. December has 31 days, so adding 31 days to November 30 brings me to December 31. Now I have 42-31=11 days left. So January has 31 days, so adding 11 days to January 1 would be January 11. Wait, wait, no, because December has 31 days, so after December 31, the next day is January 1. So adding 11 days would take me to January 11. So the maturity date for part a is January 11. Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake because when you add days, you don't count the starting day. Hmm. Let me double-check.

Wait, if the draft is dated November 12, then day 1 is November 13. So adding 60 days would be 60 days after November 12. Let me try another approach. November has 30 days, so from November 12, the remaining days in November are 30-12=18 days. So adding 18 days would bring me to November 30 (since 12+18=30). Then I have 60-18=42 days left. December has 31 days, so adding 31 days takes me to December 31. That leaves 42-31=11 days. So the next 11 days would be in January, so January 11. So the maturity date is January 11. Hmm, but let me check the options. Looking at the options, the first part of each option is for a, so in the options, the first date is January 10, 11, 12, etc.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake because sometimes when adding days, the starting day is included. Let me think again. If today is November 12, then 60 days later would be 59 days after November 13. So November has 30 days, so from November 13 to November 30 is 18 days. 60 days minus 18 days = 42. December has 31 days, so 42-31=11. So January 11. So the first part a's maturity date is January 11. But looking at the options, A starts with January 12, B with January 12, C with January 10, D with Jan 12, E with Jan 11, F Jan 13, G Jan 11, H Jan 10, I Jan 13, J Jan 11. So E, G, J have Jan 11 as the first date. So part a's answer is Jan 11, so the options that have that as the first date are E, G, J.

Okay, moving on to part b: June 10, payable 3 months after date. So 3 months from June 10. Let's see, June has 30 days. So adding 3 months would take us to September 10. Wait, because June 10 + 3 months is September 10. So the maturity date is September 10. Now looking at the options, the second date is September 10 in options A and F. But wait, let me check each option's second part. Let me look at the options again.

Option A: Jan 12, Sep 10, Apr 14, Apr 26 â†’ So part b would be Sep 10. Option B: Sep 8. C: Sep 11. D: Sep 9. E: Sep 12. F: Sep 10. G: Sep 11. H: Sep 9. I: Sep 12. J: Sep 10. So part b's correct answer is Sep 10, so options A and F and J have Sep 10 as the second date. But from part a, we're looking at E, G, J as possible options because they have Jan 11 as the first part. So J has Jan 11 and Sep 10 as the first two dates. So J is a possible candidate so far.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake with part b. Let me confirm. June has 30 days, so June 10 + 3 months would be September 10. Because adding a month each: July 10, August 10, September 10. Yes, that's correct. So part b is Sep 10. So the options that have this are A, F, and J. So from the possible options (E, G, J from part a), only J has Sep 10 as the second date. So now, J is a possibility.

Now, part c: March 3 and payable 30 days after sight if accepted March 15. Wait, so the draft is accepted on March 15. So the sight is when it's accepted, right? So the 30 days start from March 15. So adding 30 days to March 15. Let me calculate that. March has 31 days, so from March 15, adding 30 days would go into April.

March 15 to March 31 is 17 days (including the 15th?), wait no, from March 15 to March 31 is 17 days (because 31-15=16, but including the 15th, it's 17 days). So adding 30 days: 30 = 17 (March) + 13 (April). So March 15 + 30 days = April 14. So the maturity date is April 14. Now looking at the options, the third date is April 14 in options A and B.

Wait, let's check each option's third date: A: Apr 14, B: Apr 14, C: Apr 15, D: Apr 13, E: Apr 15, F: Apr 16, G: Apr 13, H: Apr 15, I: Apr 16, J: Apr 14. So part c's answer is April 14, so options A, B, J have that as the third date. From earlier, we were considering J because part a was Jan 11 and part b Sep 10. So in J, the third date is Apr 14. So that fits.

Now, part d: October 4 and payable 6 months after sight if accepted October 25. So the draft is accepted on October 25, so the sight is that day. 6 months from October 25. Let's calculate that. October 25 + 6 months is April 25 of the following year. So the maturity date is April 25. Wait, but let me check. If you add 6 months to October, you go to April, but the exact day would be the same day in the next month, unless it's beyond the number of days, but April has 30 days. October has 31 days, so October 25 is within 31, so adding 6 months would be April 25. So the maturity date is April 25.

Looking at the options, the fourth date is the last one. Let's check each option's fourth date: A: Apr 26, B: Apr 23, C: Apr 27, D: Apr 24, E: Apr 26, F: Apr 27, G: Apr 24, H: Apr 25, I: Apr 27, J: Apr 25. So part d is April 25, so the fourth date should be April 25. Looking at the options, H and J have that as their fourth date.

Wait, but earlier, from part a, the correct answer for a was Jan 11, which is in options E, G, J. And part b requires Sep 10, which is in J and F. But from part c, the third date is Apr 14, which is in J (since J's third date is Apr 14). And part d's correct date is Apr 25, which is in H and J. So the only option that matches all four parts would be J, which has:

a: Jan 11

b: Sep 10

c: Apr 14

d: Apr 25

So the option J is "J: January 11, September 10, April 14, April 25"

Wait, but let me double-check all parts once more to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

Part a: November 12 + 60 days. Let me recount. November has 30 days. From Nov 12, adding 60 days. So 30 -12 = 18 days left in November, so Nov 12 +18 days = Nov 30. Then 60-18=42 days left. December has 31, so Dec 31. 42-31=11 days. So January 11. Correct.

Part b: June 10 +3 months = Sep 10. Correct.

Part c: March 15 +30 days. March has 31 days, so from March 15, adding 30 days. March 15 to March 31 is 17 days (including 15th?), no, from 15 to 31 is 17 days (31-15=16, but including the 15th, it's 17). So 30 days is 17 in March, 13 in April. So March 15 +30 days is April 14. Correct.

Part d: October 25 +6 months. October has 31 days, so October 25 +6 months is April 25. Correct.

So the correct option is J: January 11, September 10, April 14, April 25.

Wait, but looking at the options, option J is listed as:

J: January 11, September 10, April 14, April 25.

Yes, that's correct. So the answer should be J.
</think>

The maturity dates for each part are calculated as follows:

- **a)** November 12 + 60 days = January 11  
- **b)** June 10 + 3 months = September 10  
- **c)** March 15 + 30 days = April 14  
- **d)** October 25 + 6 months = April 25  

The correct option matching all dates is **J**.

Answer: J
