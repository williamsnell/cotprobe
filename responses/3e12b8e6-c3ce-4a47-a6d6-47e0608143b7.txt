Question:

How can evaluation apprehension be eliminated fromsocial psychologicalexperimental settings?

Options:

A: By conducting the experiment with subject's peers present
B: By offering financial incentives to the subjects
C: By making the subject aware they are being observed
D: Through field experimentation and 'nonobtrusive' approaches
E: By providing subjects with false feedback on their performance

Okay, so I have this question about social psychology experiments and evaluation apprehension. I'm a bit rusty on my terms, but I'll try to think it through.

Evaluation apprehension... I remember that term from my studies. It refers to the anxiety or concern a person feels about being evaluated or judged by others during an experiment. This can affect their behavior because they might act differently if they feel they're being watched or assessed.

The question is asking how to eliminate evaluation apprehension in experimental settings. So, the goal is to find a method that reduces or removes this anxiety.

Looking at the options:

A: Conducting the experiment with the subject's peers present. Wait, wouldn't that increase evaluation apprehension? If the subject's friends or peers are there, they might feel more pressure to perform or behave a certain way, leading to more anxiety. So probably not A.

B: Offering financial incentives. Hmm, I'm not sure how that affects evaluation apprehension. Maybe if people are paid, they might be more motivated, but does that reduce anxiety about being judged? I don't think so. It might just make them participate more, but not necessarily reduce the anxiety. So B might not be the answer.

C: Making the subject aware they're being observed. Oh, that sounds like it would increase anxiety. If you tell them they're being watched, they'd probably feel more self-conscious and anxious. So C is likely not the solution; it might even cause more of the problem.

D: Through field experimentation and 'nonobtrusive' approaches. Field experiments are conducted in real-world settings rather than labs. Nonobtrusive means the subjects aren't aware they're being observed. That makes sense because if they don't know they're being watched, they might act more naturally, reducing evaluation apprehension. So D seems like a good candidate.

E: Providing false feedback. I'm not sure about this. False feedback might affect their performance but doesn't directly address the anxiety of being evaluated. Plus, using false information could have ethical issues. So E probably isn't the right approach.

F: Increasing the number of observers. More observers might make the subject feel more watched, which would increase anxiety. So F is likely making the problem worse, not better.

G: Double-blind procedure. In a double-blind, neither the subjects nor the experimenters know the true purpose. But does that reduce evaluation apprehension? I'm not sure. It might help in avoiding bias, but I don't think it directly addresses the anxiety about being evaluated. So G might not be the answer.

H: Conducting the experiment in a familiar environment. Familiar settings can make people feel more comfortable, which might reduce anxiety. That's a possibility. But is it the best option compared to other choices?

So, between D and H. D suggests using nonobtrusive methods in field settings. Since subjects aren't aware they're being observed, they're less likely to feel evaluated. H is about the environment; a familiar place can reduce anxiety, but it's more about the setting than the method of observation.

The question is about eliminating evaluation apprehension. The best way is probably to make the observation nonobtrusive so the subjects don't feel watched. So D seems like the correct answer.

The correct answer is D: Through field experimentation and 'nonobtrusive' approaches. By conducting experiments in real-world settings and observing subjects without their awareness, evaluation apprehension is minimized as subjects are less likely to feel they are being judged.
