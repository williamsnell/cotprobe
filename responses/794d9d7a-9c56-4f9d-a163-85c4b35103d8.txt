Question:

A chemist is given an unknown element X. He finds that the element X has an atomic weight of 210.197amu and consists of only two isotopes, ^210X and ^212X. If the masses of these isotopes are, respectively, 209.64 and 211.66amu, what is the relative abundance of the two isotopes?

Options:

A: 60.40% and 39.60%
B: 90% and 10%
C: 72.42% and 27.58%
D: 50% and 50%
E: 65% and 35%
F: 85% and 15%
G: 55.55% and 44.45%
H: 80% and 20%
I: 30% and 70%
J: 75.58% and 24.42%

Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about isotopes and atomic weight. Hmm, let's see. The element X has an atomic weight of 210.197 amu, and it's made up of two isotopes: ^210X and ^212X. Their masses are 209.64 and 211.66 amu respectively. I need to find their relative abundances.

Wait, I remember that the atomic weight is the weighted average of the isotopic masses based on their abundances. So I should set up an equation. Let me denote the abundance of ^210X as 'a' and ^212X as 'b'. Since they're the only two, a + b = 100%, but maybe it's easier to work with decimals, so a + b = 1.

The atomic weight is then (a * 209.64) + (b * 211.66) = 210.197. But since b = 1 - a, I can substitute that in.

So the equation becomes: 209.64a + 211.66(1 - a) = 210.197.

Let me expand that. 209.64a + 211.66 - 211.66a = 210.197.

Combine like terms: (209.64a - 211.66a) + 211.66 = 210.197.

That simplifies to (-2.02a) + 211.66 = 210.197.

Now subtract 211.66 from both sides: -2.02a = 210.197 - 211.66.

Calculating the right side: 210.197 - 211.66 = -1.463.

So, -2.02a = -1.463.

Divide both sides by -2.02: a = (-1.463)/(-2.02) â‰ˆ 0.7242, which is 72.42%.

Since a is the abundance of ^210X, the other isotope, ^212X, would be 100% - 72.42% = 27.58%.

Looking at the options, option C is 72.42% and 27.58%, so that should be the answer.

The relative abundances are calculated by setting up an equation based on the weighted average of the isotopic masses. Solving the equation yields 72.42% for ^210X and 27.58% for ^212X.

Answer: C
