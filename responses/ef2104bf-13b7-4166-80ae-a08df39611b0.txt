Question:

A man and a woman were involved in a car accident that occurred when the man abruptly switched lanes in front of the woman without signaling. Unable to stop, the woman hit the man's car into a median. Immediately after the accident, as the two drivers emerged from their vehicles, a pedestrian, obviously emotional and upset from having just observed an accident, ran up to the man and shouted, "You careless driver, you. Didn't you ever learn that you're supposed to use a turn signal when you switch lanes?" The pedestrian is never identified and is not present at trial. The pedestrian's statement is

Options:

A: inadmissible, because the bystander was not involved in the accident.
B: admissible, because it is relevant to the case.
C: admissible under the excited utterance exception.
D: admissible as non-hearsay.
E: admissible, even though it is hearsay.
F: admissible under the present sense impression exception.
G: inadmissible, because it is an opinion, not a fact.
H: inadmissible, because the bystander cannot be identified and is not present at trial.
I: inadmissible, because it is prejudicial to the defendant.
J: admissible under the spontaneous statement exception.

Okay, so I've got this question about evidence law, specifically about the admissibility of a statement made by a pedestrian after a car accident. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the scenario: a man and a woman are involved in a car accident. The man switched lanes without signaling, causing the woman to hit his car into a median. After the accident, a pedestrian who saw it runs up to the man and shouts at him, calling him a careless driver and asking why he didn't use a turn signal. The pedestrian isn't identified and isn't at the trial. The question is whether the pedestrian's statement is admissible.

I remember that in evidence law, statements made out of court are generally hearsay unless they fall under an exception. So the key here is whether this statement qualifies as an exception to the hearsay rule.

The options given include several possibilities, like excited utterance, present sense impression, spontaneous statement, etc. Let me think about each.

The pedestrian was emotional and upset, having just observed the accident. That makes me think about the excited utterance exception. I recall that an excited utterance is a statement made under the stress of a startling event, where the declarant is still under the stress, and the statement relates to the event. The rationale is that the person is so excited they can't fabricate, so the statement is reliable.

In this case, the pedestrian saw the accident happen, ran up, and shouted right after. That sounds like it was made under the stress of the accident. So maybe this is an excited utterance.

Another option is the present sense impression, which is a statement describing an event made while it's happening or immediately after. Here, the pedestrian was there right after the accident, so it might also fit as a present sense impression. Wait, but the excited utterance and present sense impression are similar. Let me check the rules.

Under the Federal Rules of Evidence, an excited utterance is under FRE 803(2), and present sense impression is under 803(1). The present sense impression requires the statement to describe an event made while it's occurring or immediately thereafter, and the declarant is perceiving the event or its immediate aftermath. The excited utterance requires the statement to relate to a startling event and was made while the declarant was under the stress of that event.

In this case, the pedestrian saw the accident (a startling event) and made the statement shortly after. He was still under the stress of the event. So both exceptions might apply, but I think excited utterance is more appropriate here because it's a reaction to a startling event, and it's a statement of accusation towards the man's driving.

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option C: admissible under the excited utterance exception. That seems correct.

Option F: present sense impression. It could also fit, but I think excited utterance is more precise here because of the emotional outburst.

Other options: Option E says it's admissible even though it's hearsay. But if it's an exception, then it's admissible, so E is correct in a way, but the better answer is likely C.

Option H says it's inadmissible because the bystander isn't present. But I think the rule doesn't require the declarant to be present; it's about the statement's reliability. So H is incorrect.

Option I: inadmissible because prejudicial. Hearsay evidence can sometimes be excluded if it's more prejudicial than probative, but here the statement is directly relevant to the man's driving, so I don't think it's excluded on that basis.

So the best answer is C: admissible under the excited utterance exception.
</think>

The pedestrian's statement is admissible under the excited utterance exception because it was made immediately after a startling event (the car accident) while the declarant was still under the stress of that event. This aligns with the requirements of the exception, making the statement reliable and non-hearsay.

Answer: C
