Question:

What is meant when it is said that "the accelerator is asymmetric "?

Options:

A: The accelerator inversely affects the level of investment and capital creation
B: The accelerator is only operational during periods of economic boom
C: The acceleration principle applies only when the required capital for a certain level of output is greater than the available capital, but does not apply in the reverse situation
D: The accelerator is a term used to describe the fluctuating interest rates on capital loans
E: The acceleration principle applies only when the available capital for a certain level of output is greater than the required capital, but does not apply in the reverse situation
F: The accelerator affects only the service sector but not the manufacturing sector
G: The accelerator applies equally to capital surplus and deficit
H: The accelerator only applies when required capital is less than available capital
I: The accelerator applies to the rate of technological innovation in capital goods
J: The accelerator refers to the rate of capital depreciation

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out what it means when someone says "the accelerator is asymmetric." I'm a bit rusty on my economics terms, but I'll try to break it down.

First, I remember that the accelerator principle in economics has to do with investment and capital. From what I recall, the accelerator effect suggests that an initial increase in output leads to a larger increase in investment because more output requires more capital goods. So, the idea is that investment responds more than proportionally to changes in output.

Now, the term "asymmetric" generally means something isn't equal or balanced on both sides. So, if the accelerator is asymmetric, it probably doesn't work the same way in all situations. Let me think about how the accelerator might not apply equally.

Looking at the options, option C says the acceleration principle applies when the required capital is greater than the available capital but not the other way around. That makes sense because if you need more capital than you have (required > available), you have to invest more to meet the higher output. But if you have more capital than needed (available > required), maybe the accelerator doesn't kick in as much. That asymmetry would mean it only works in one direction.

Option E is the opposite, saying it applies only when available capital is greater than required. That doesn't seem right because usually, you invest more when you need more, not when you have excess.

Option H says the accelerator only applies when required is less than available. That seems backwards too because if you have more than you need, why would you invest more? You might actually reduce investment if there's a surplus.

Options A and B don't seem directly related to the asymmetry of the accelerator effect. D talks about interest rates, which isn't about the accelerator's application condition. F is about sectors, which might not be the point here. G says it applies equally, which would contradict the idea of being asymmetric. I and J are about other economic concepts.

So, putting it all together, the asymmetric accelerator means it only works in one directionâ€”when you need more capital than you have. So the correct answer should be option C.

The correct answer is C. The accelerator is asymmetric because it only applies when the required capital exceeds the available capital, not the other way around.

Answer: C
