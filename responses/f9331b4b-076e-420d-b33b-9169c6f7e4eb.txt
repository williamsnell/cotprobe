Okay, so I've got this fluid mechanics problem to solve. Let me read it carefully and figure out what I need to do. 

The question says that air with a density of ρ = 0.07 lb/ft³ and viscosity μ = 12.9 × 10^-6 lb/ft·sec is flowing through a pipe that has an inside diameter of 10 inches. The mean velocity is 50 ft/sec. I need to find the velocity at points 0.4 inches and 3 inches from the wall. Also, I have to determine the thickness of the laminar sub-layer where u+ and y+ are both 5. 

Hmm, I remember that in laminar flow in a pipe, the velocity profile follows a parabolic distribution. The formula for the velocity at a certain distance y from the wall is given by the Hagen-Poiseuille equation, which is u(y) = (2u_0/C)*(R² - y²), where u_0 is the maximum velocity, R is the radius of the pipe, and C is some constant, but maybe I should look it up more accurately.

Wait, actually, the velocity distribution in laminar flow is given by u(y) = (u_avg) * ( (R² - y²) / R² ), but wait, no, that might not be right. Alternatively, I think the velocity profile is u(y) = (u_max) * (1 - (y²/R²)), but I'm not sure. Wait, the mean velocity u_avg is related to the maximum velocity u_max by u_avg = u_max / 2. So if the mean velocity is 50 ft/s, then u_max would be 100 ft/s.

Wait, but wait, let me think again. The formula for the velocity at a distance y from the wall in a laminar flow is u(y) = (u_avg) * (1 - (y²/R²)), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, another approach is to use the formula for the velocity profile in a pipe, which is u(y) = (u_0) * (1 - (y²/R²)), where u_0 is the centerline velocity, which is twice the mean velocity for laminar flow. So if the mean velocity is 50 ft/s, then the centerline velocity u_0 would be 100 ft/s. 

Wait, no, that's not correct. Because for laminar flow in a pipe, the average velocity is half the maximum velocity. So if the mean velocity u_avg is 50, then the maximum velocity u_max is 100. So the velocity at any point y from the wall is given by u(y) = u_max * (1 - (y²/R²)). Or perhaps it's better to express it in terms of the radius. 

First, let's find the radius R of the pipe. The inside diameter is 10 inches, so the radius R is 5 inches. But since the other measurements are in feet and seconds, maybe I should convert everything to consistent units. Let's convert R to feet. 5 inches is 5/12 feet, which is approximately 0.4167 ft.

Now, the distance from the wall, y, is given in inches. For the first point, y1 is 0.4 inches from the wall, and for the second, y2 is 3 inches. So I need to convert these to feet as well. y1 is 0.4/12 = 0.03333 ft, and y2 is 3/12 = 0.25 ft.

Wait, but wait, the radius R is 5 inches, which is 5/12 ft ≈ 0.4167 ft. So for y1 = 0.4 inches, which is 0.03333 ft, from the wall, the distance from the center would be R - y1 = 0.4167 ft - 0.03333 ft ≈ 0.3833 ft. Wait, no, no. Wait, the distance from the wall is y, so the distance from the center is R - y. Wait, no, no, that's not right. Wait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me clarify.

In the pipe, the distance from the wall to the center is R. So if y is the distance from the wall, the radial position r from the center is R - y. Wait, no, that's not correct. Because if y is measured from the wall, then the position from the center is r = R - y. But when y is zero at the wall, r is R, and when y is R at the center, r would be zero. Wait, that can't be right because the velocity at the center is maximum. So perhaps the formula should be expressed in terms of r, the distance from the center.

Wait, let me think again. The velocity profile in laminar flow in a pipe is given by u(r) = (u_max) * (1 - (r²/R²)), where r is the distance from the center, and R is the radius. So u_max is at r=0, which is the center. 

But in this problem, the mean velocity is given as 50 ft/s. For laminar flow, the mean velocity is u_avg = u_max / 2. So u_max = 2 * u_avg = 100 ft/s.

So to find the velocity at a point y from the wall, I need to find the distance r from the center, which is r = R - y. Then plug into u(r) = u_max * (1 - (r²/R²)).

Wait, but let's double-check that. Because if y is the distance from the wall, then r = R - y. So for example, at y=0 (wall), r = R, and u(r) = 0, which makes sense. At y = R (center), r=0, and u(r)=u_max, which is correct.

So let's compute R in feet. R = 5 inches = 5/12 ft ≈ 0.4167 ft.

Now, for the first point, y1 = 0.4 inches from the wall. Convert to feet: y1 = 0.4 / 12 ≈ 0.03333 ft.

So r1 = R - y1 = 0.4167 - 0.03333 ≈ 0.3833 ft.

Now compute u(r1) = u_max * (1 - (r1²/R²)).

r1² = (0.3833)^2 ≈ 0.1469 ft².

R² = (0.4167)^2 ≈ 0.1736 ft².

r1²/R² ≈ 0.1469 / 0.1736 ≈ 0.8466.

So u(r1) = 100 * (1 - 0.8466) = 100 * 0.1534 ≈ 15.34 ft/s.

Wait, that's way lower than the options given. The options for the first point are in the 40s and 50s. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait a second, I think I messed up the formula. Because the mean velocity is 50 ft/s, which is the average. So the maximum velocity is 100 ft/s. But perhaps I should be using the formula for the velocity at a distance y from the wall in terms of the mean velocity.

Wait, another approach: the velocity profile in laminar flow is given by u(y) = (2u_avg) * (R² - y²)/(R²). Wait, no, let me check.

Wait, the correct formula for the velocity distribution in a pipe is u(y) = (u_avg) * ( (R² - y²) / R² ) * (something). Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use the formula where u(y) = (u_avg) * ( (R² - y²) / R² ), but I'm not sure. Let me think.

Wait, no, the correct formula is u(y) = (u_avg) * ( (R² - y²) / R² ) * (something). Wait, perhaps I should look it up, but since I can't, I'll try to derive it.

The flow rate Q in laminar pipe flow is given by Q = (π R^4 u_avg) / 8, where u_avg is the mean velocity. The velocity profile is u(r) = (2 u_avg r) / R², but no, that's not correct. Wait, no, the velocity profile is u(r) = (u_avg) * (2r/R²) * (R - r), but I'm not confident.

Alternatively, I think the correct velocity profile is u(r) = (u_avg) * (2r/R) * (1 - r/(2R)), but I'm not sure. Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the parabolic distribution.

Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let's correct this. The correct velocity profile in a pipe for laminar flow is given by:

u(r) = (u_avg) * ( (R² - r²) ) / R²

Wait, but that would make u(r) maximum at r=0, which is correct. So when r=0, u(r)=u_avg*(1) = u_avg. But wait, that can't be right because in reality, the maximum velocity u_max is twice the mean velocity for laminar flow. So if the mean velocity is u_avg, then u_max = 2 u_avg.

So perhaps the correct formula is u(r) = (2 u_avg) * (1 - (r²/R²)). So when r=0, u(r)=2 u_avg, which is the maximum velocity, and when r=R, u(r)=0, which is correct.

So let's use that formula: u(r) = 2 u_avg (1 - (r²/R²)).

So in this case, u_avg is 50 ft/s, so u_max = 100 ft/s.

Now, for the first point, y1 = 0.4 inches from the wall. We need to find the velocity at that point. But wait, y is the distance from the wall, so r = R - y.

Wait, R is 5 inches, which is 5/12 ft ≈ 0.4167 ft.

y1 = 0.4 inches = 0.4/12 ≈ 0.03333 ft.

So r1 = R - y1 = 0.4167 - 0.03333 ≈ 0.3833 ft.

Now, plug into u(r1):

u(r1) = 2 * 50 * (1 - (0.3833² / 0.4167²)).

Calculate 0.3833² ≈ 0.1469, and 0.4167² ≈ 0.1736.

So (0.1469 / 0.1736) ≈ 0.8466.

So 1 - 0.8466 = 0.1534.

Thus, u(r1) = 100 * 0.1534 ≈ 15.34 ft/s.

Wait, but that's way lower than the options given, which are in the 40s and 50s. So I must have made a mistake in my approach.

Wait, perhaps I'm using the wrong formula. Let me think again. Maybe the formula is u(y) = u_avg * ( (R^2 - y^2) ) / R^2. So let's try that.

So using u(y) = u_avg * (R² - y²) / R².

So for y1 = 0.03333 ft, R = 0.4167 ft.

R² = (0.4167)^2 ≈ 0.1736 ft².

y1² = (0.03333)^2 ≈ 0.001111 ft².

So R² - y1² ≈ 0.1736 - 0.001111 ≈ 0.1725 ft².

Then u(y1) = 50 * (0.1725 / 0.1736) ≈ 50 * 0.9936 ≈ 49.68 ft/s, which is approximately 49.7 ft/s.

Wait, that's more in line with the options given. So perhaps I was using the wrong formula earlier. So the correct formula is u(y) = u_avg * (R² - y²)/R².

So for the first point, y1 = 0.4 inches from the wall, the velocity is approximately 49.7 ft/s, which is close to option B's 48 ft/s or option H's 49.5 ft/s.

Now, let's compute the second point: y2 = 3 inches from the wall. Convert to feet: 3/12 = 0.25 ft.

So y2 = 0.25 ft.

R = 0.4167 ft.

y2² = (0.25)^2 = 0.0625 ft².

R² = 0.1736 ft².

R² - y2² = 0.1736 - 0.0625 = 0.1111 ft².

u(y2) = 50 * (0.1111 / 0.1736) ≈ 50 * 0.640 ≈ 32.0 ft/s.

Wait, but the options suggest that the velocity at 3 inches from the wall is higher than the mean velocity, which is 50 ft/s. That can't be right because the velocity should decrease as you move away from the center towards the wall. So if y2 is 3 inches from the wall, which is 5 - 3 = 2 inches from the center, which is closer to the center than the first point. Wait, no, wait: if the diameter is 10 inches, then the radius is 5 inches. So 3 inches from the wall is 5 - 3 = 2 inches from the center. So that's closer to the center than y1=0.4 inches, which is 5 - 0.4=4.6 inches from the center. So the velocity at y2 should be higher than at y1. Wait, but according to my calculation, u(y2)=32 ft/s, which is lower than u(y1)=49.7 ft/s. That can't be correct because y2 is closer to the center, so velocity should be higher.

Hmm, I must have made a mistake. Let's recheck the formula.

Wait, perhaps I should express the velocity profile in terms of r, the distance from the center, rather than y, the distance from the wall. Because when you're 3 inches from the wall, you're 2 inches from the center. So r = R - y = 5 - 3 = 2 inches from the center.

So using the formula u(r) = (2 u_avg) * (R² - r²)/R².

Wait, so for r2=2 inches = 2/12 ≈ 0.1667 ft.

R = 5/12 ≈ 0.4167 ft.

r2² = (0.1667)^2 ≈ 0.02778 ft².

R² = 0.1736 ft².

So R² - r2² ≈ 0.1736 - 0.02778 ≈ 0.1458 ft².

u(r2) = 100 * (0.1458 / 0.1736) ≈ 100 * 0.839 ≈ 83.9 ft/s.

Wait, that's much higher than the mean velocity, which makes sense because it's closer to the center. But the options suggest that the velocity at 3 inches from the wall is higher than the mean, but in the options, the second velocity is around 55-62 ft/s, which is less than the center velocity of 100 ft/s. So perhaps I'm still making a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should use the correct formula for the velocity profile. Let me look up the correct formula.

Upon checking, the correct velocity profile for laminar flow in a pipe is given by:

u(r) = (u_avg) * ( (4 R² - r²) ) / (2 R²)

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, the correct formula is u(r) = (u_avg) * (2 r) / R² * (R - r). Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

The correct formula is derived from integrating the Navier-Stokes equations for laminar flow in a pipe. The velocity profile is:

u(r) = ( - (4 μ / R²) ) * ln(1 - r²/R²) )

But that might be too complicated. Alternatively, the correct velocity distribution is given by:

u(r) = (u_avg) * ( (R² - r²) ) / R²

Wait, but when r=0, u(r)=u_avg, which would imply that the center velocity is u_avg, which contradicts the fact that in laminar flow, the center velocity is twice the mean velocity.

Wait, perhaps I was correct earlier that the mean velocity is u_avg = u_max / 2, so u_max=2 u_avg.

So the correct formula is u(r) = u_max (1 - (r²/R²)).

So with u_max=100 ft/s, then u(r) = 100*(1 - (r²/R²)).

So for y1=0.4 inches from the wall, r1 = R - y1 = 5 inches - 0.4 inches = 4.6 inches = 4.6/12 ≈ 0.3833 ft.

r1² = (0.3833)^2 ≈ 0.1469 ft².

R² = (0.4167)^2 ≈ 0.1736 ft².

So u(r1) = 100*(1 - 0.1469/0.1736) ≈ 100*(1 - 0.8466) ≈ 100*0.1534 ≈ 15.34 ft/s.

Wait, that's way lower than the options, which suggests I'm doing something wrong. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula where u_avg is the average of the profile, which is u_avg = (u_max)/2.

But the problem is that according to this, the velocity at y=0 is zero, and it increases towards the center. So at y=0.4 inches from the wall, which is 4.6 inches from the center, the velocity should be lower than the mean velocity.

But in the options, the velocities are all around the mean velocity, which doesn't make sense. So perhaps the question is not about laminar flow but turbulent flow? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, the question also asks about the laminar sub-layer, which suggests it's in the context of turbulent flow. But the velocities given in the options are higher than the mean velocity, which doesn't make sense for laminar flow. So perhaps I'm approaching this incorrectly.

Wait, maybe the question is about velocity in a turbulent flow, and the velocity at certain distances from the wall. In turbulent flow, the velocity profile near the wall can be described by logarithmic laws, but perhaps in this case, it's a laminar sub-layer where the velocity profile is still parabolic.

Wait, the question mentions that the laminar sub-layer extends up to u+ = y+ =5. So perhaps we're dealing with the viscous sub-layer in turbulent flow, where the velocity profile is given by the law of the wall: u(y) = (u_avg) * (ln(y+/k) - 1), but that's for turbulent flow. But the question also says to use the laminar sub-layer where u+ and y+ are both 5, which might imply a transition.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the velocity at certain distances from the wall in laminar flow, and then find the thickness of the laminar sub-layer where y+ =5.

Wait, let's first compute the velocity at 0.4 inches and 3 inches from the wall in laminar flow.

Wait, perhaps I should use the correct formula for the velocity profile in laminar flow, which is:

u(y) = u_avg * ( (R^2 - y^2) ) / R^2

But wait, in that case, when y=0, u= u_avg, but that's not correct because the maximum velocity is at the center, which should be 2*u_avg.

So perhaps the correct formula is:

u(y) = u_avg * (2(R^2 - y^2)) / R^2

Wait, let's test this. At y=0, u=2 u_avg, which is correct. At y=R, u=0, which is correct. So the formula would be:

u(y) = 2 u_avg (R² - y²) / R²

So with u_avg =50 ft/s,

u(y) = 100 * (R² - y²)/R²

Now, R=5 inches=5/12 ft≈0.4167 ft.

For y1=0.4 inches=0.0333 ft,

y1²= (0.0333)^2≈0.00111 ft².

R²=0.4167²≈0.1736 ft².

So R² - y1²≈0.1725 ft².

Thus, u(y1)=100*(0.1725/0.1736)≈100*0.9936≈99.36 ft/s.

Wait, that can't be right because the mean velocity is 50 ft/s, and the center velocity should be 100 ft/s. So at y=0, u=100 ft/s, which is correct. At y=5 inches, u=0.

Wait, but for y1=0.4 inches from the wall, the velocity is approximately 99.36 ft/s, which is almost the center velocity. That doesn't make sense because 0.4 inches from the wall is very close to the wall, so the velocity should be very low, approaching zero.

I must be making a mistake here. Let me re-express the formula correctly.

The correct velocity profile in laminar flow is:

u(r) = (u_max) * (1 - (r²/R²))

where u_max = 2 u_avg.

So u_avg =50 ft/s, u_max=100 ft/s.

r is the distance from the center.

So for a point y inches from the wall, the distance from the center is r = R - y.

So for y1=0.4 inches,

r1 = R - y1 =5 inches -0.4 inches=4.6 inches=4.6/12≈0.3833 ft.

r1²=0.3833²≈0.1469 ft².

R²= (5/12)^2≈0.1736 ft².

u(r1)=100*(1 - 0.1469/0.1736)=100*(1 -0.8466)=100*0.1534≈15.34 ft/s.

So the velocity at 0.4 inches from the wall is approximately 15.34 ft/s.

Wait, but that's much lower than any of the options given, which start at around 43 ft/s. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the flow is turbulent, and the velocity at those points is higher.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is not about the velocity in the pipe but in a boundary layer, but it's specified as a pipe flow.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the velocity in the boundary layer, but I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps the velocity at those points is the same as the mean velocity, which is 50 ft/s, but that doesn't make sense because the velocity near the wall should be lower.

Wait, looking at the options, option J has velocities equal to the mean velocity, which can't be correct. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the pipe is large, and the flow is turbulent, and the velocity at certain distances from the wall is higher than the mean. But that doesn't make sense because in turbulent flow, the velocity is higher near the center and lower near the wall.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to compute the velocity at 0.4 inches from the wall using the correct formula.

u(y) = u_avg * ( (R² - y²) ) / R²

So for y=0.4 inches=0.0333 ft,

u(y)=50*( (0.4167² - 0.0333² ) / 0.4167² )

=50*( (0.1736 - 0.00111) / 0.1736 )

=50*(0.1725 / 0.1736)≈50*0.9936≈49.68 ft/s.

So that's about 49.7 ft/s, which is close to option H's 49.5 ft/s for the first point.

Now, for y=3 inches=0.25 ft,

u(y)=50*( (0.4167² - 0.25² ) / 0.4167² )

=50*( (0.1736 - 0.0625) / 0.1736 )

=50*(0.1111 / 0.1736)≈50*0.640≈32.0 ft/s.

Wait, but that's lower than the mean velocity, which makes sense because it's further from the center. But the options suggest that the velocity at 3 inches is higher, which doesn't make sense. So perhaps I'm using the wrong formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula should be u(y) = u_avg * ( (R² - y²) ) / R², but that gives lower velocities as y increases, which is correct. So the first point is around 49.7 ft/s, and the second point is around 32 ft/s. But the options don't have 32; they have higher values.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the sign. Let me check: y is the distance from the wall, so as y increases, we move towards the center. So at y=3 inches, we're 3 inches from the wall, which is 5-3=2 inches from the center. So the velocity should be higher than at y=0.4 inches.

Wait, but according to my calculation, at y=3 inches, the velocity is 32 ft/s, which is lower than at y=0.4 inches, which is 49.7 ft/s. That can't be right because moving closer to the center should increase the velocity.

Wait, that suggests that I'm making a mistake in the formula. Let me try a different approach. Let's compute the velocity at the center (y=5 inches) which should be 100 ft/s, and at y=0, velocity is zero.

Wait, using the formula u(y) = 50*( (0.4167² - y² ) / 0.4167² )

At y=0, u=50*(0.4167² / 0.4167²)=50 ft/s, which is the mean velocity. But that's incorrect because the maximum velocity should be 100 ft/s at the center.

So I must have the formula wrong. The correct formula should give u_max=100 ft/s at y=0. So perhaps the formula is:

u(y) = 100*( (R² - y² ) / R² )

So u(y)=100*( (0.4167² - y² ) / 0.4167² )

At y=0, u=100*(0.4167² / 0.4167² )=100 ft/s.

At y=5 inches, u=0.

So for y1=0.4 inches,

u(y1)=100*( (0.4167² - 0.4² ) / 0.4167² )

Wait, but 0.4 inches is 0.4/12=0.03333 ft.

So y1=0.03333 ft.

So y1²=0.001111 ft².

So R²=0.1736 ft².

So u(y1)=100*(0.1736 - 0.001111)/0.1736=100*(0.1725/0.1736)=100*0.9936≈99.36 ft/s.

Wait, that's even higher, which can't be right because at y=0.4 inches from the wall, the velocity should be lower than the center velocity.

I'm clearly making a mistake here. Let me try to find the correct formula for the velocity profile in laminar flow in a pipe.

Upon checking, the correct velocity distribution in laminar flow in a pipe is given by:

u(r) = ( (2 μ ) / R² ) * ( R² - r² ) / (4 μ )

Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me think again.

The correct velocity profile is derived from solving the Navier-Stokes equations for laminar flow in a pipe, and it is:

u(r) = (u_max) * (1 - (r²/R²))

where u_max is the maximum velocity at the center.

The mean velocity u_avg is related to u_max by:

u_avg = (u_max)/2

So if u_avg=50 ft/s, then u_max=100 ft/s.

So the formula is:

u(r) = 100*(1 - (r²/R²))

where r is the distance from the center.

Now, to find the velocity at a distance y from the wall, we first find r = R - y.

So for y1=0.4 inches=0.03333 ft,

r1=R - y1=0.4167 - 0.03333≈0.3833 ft.

r1²=0.3833²≈0.1469 ft².

R²=0.4167²≈0.1736 ft².

So u(r1)=100*(1 - 0.1469/0.1736)=100*(1 -0.8466)=100*0.1534≈15.34 ft/s.

That's the velocity at y1=0.4 inches from the wall.

Now, for y2=3 inches=0.25 ft,

r2=R - y2=0.4167 - 0.25=0.1667 ft.

r2²=0.1667²≈0.02778 ft².

u(r2)=100*(1 - 0.02778/0.1736)=100*(1 -0.1598)=100*0.8402≈84.02 ft/s.

That's the velocity at y2=3 inches from the wall.

So the velocities are approximately 15.34 ft/s and 84.02 ft/s.

But looking at the options, none of them have these values. The options have velocities around 45-60 ft/s, which suggests I'm still making a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the distance from the wall with the distance from the center. Alternatively, perhaps the formula should be expressed differently. Let me try another approach.

The correct formula for the velocity profile in laminar flow is:

u(y) = u_avg * ( (R² - y²) ) / R²

But this would give u(y=0)=u_avg, which is incorrect because the maximum velocity should be at the center.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

u(y) = u_avg * ( (R² - y²) ) / (R²)

But then u_max would be u_avg when y=0, which is wrong.

I'm clearly confused here. Let me try to find a reliable source.

Upon checking, the correct velocity profile in laminar flow in a pipe is:

u(r) = (u_avg) * ( (4 R² - r²) ) / (2 R²)

Wait, no, that's not correct. The correct formula is:

u(r) = (u_avg) * ( (R² - r²) ) / ( (R²) )

But this would give u_max= u_avg when r=0, which is incorrect. So perhaps I'm missing a factor.

Wait, I think the correct formula is:

u(r) = (u_avg) * ( (R² - r²) ) / ( (R²) )

But that would mean that u_max = u_avg, which is wrong. So perhaps the correct formula is:

u(r) = (2 u_avg) * ( (R² - r²) ) / ( (R²) )

In that case, u_max=2 u_avg when r=0.

So with u_avg=50 ft/s, u_max=100 ft/s.

So u(r)=100*( (R² - r²)/R² )

Now, for y1=0.4 inches from the wall,

r1=R - y1=5 inches -0.4 inches=4.6 inches=0.3833 ft.

r1²=0.1469 ft².

R²=0.1736 ft².

u(r1)=100*( (0.1736 -0.1469)/0.1736 )=100*(0.0267/0.1736)=100*0.1534≈15.34 ft/s.

Again, same result, but the options don't match.

Wait, perhaps the question is not about laminar flow but about the velocity distribution in a turbulent flow's laminar sub-layer. The problem mentions u+ and y+, which are dimensionless quantities used in the context of turbulent flow near the wall.

So, perhaps the velocity at those points is determined using the law of the wall for turbulent flow, but in the laminar sub-layer, the velocity profile is still parabolic.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is to find the velocity at those points using the laminar sub-layer thickness, where y+ =5.

First, let's compute the thickness of the laminar sub-layer where y+ =5.

The definition of y+ is:

y+ = (y * rho * u_tau) / mu

where u_tau is the friction velocity.

But in this case, the problem defines y+ as [(y * rho * u*) / mu], where u* is the mean velocity.

Wait, the problem defines u+ and y+ as:

u+ = (u y) / u*

y+ = (y rho u*) / mu

Wait, that seems a bit non-standard. Usually, y+ is defined as (y * u_tau)/nu, where u_tau is the friction velocity and nu is the kinematic viscosity.

But according to the problem, u+ is (u y)/u*, and y+ is (y rho u*)/mu.

Wait, perhaps I should proceed with the given definitions.

We are to find the thickness of the laminar sub-layer where y+ =5.

So, y+ = (y rho u*) / mu =5.

We can solve for y:

y = (5 * mu) / (rho u*)

Given:

rho=0.07 lb/ft³

mu=12.9e-6 lb/(ft·sec)

u*=50 ft/s.

So,

y = (5 * 12.9e-6) / (0.07 *50 )

Compute numerator:5 *12.9e-6=64.5e-6=6.45e-5 lb/(ft·sec)

Denominator:0.07 *50=3.5 lb/(ft·s²)

Wait, no, units might not be correct. Let me compute:

mu has units lb/(ft·s), rho is lb/ft³, u* is ft/s.

So y+ = (y * rho * u*) / mu.

So y = (y+ * mu) / (rho u*)

Plugging in the numbers:

y = (5 * 12.9e-6 lb/(ft·s)) / (0.07 lb/ft³ *50 ft/s)

Compute denominator: 0.07 *50=3.5 lb/(ft²·s)

So,

y = (5 *12.9e-6) / (3.5 )

= (64.5e-6) /3.5 ≈1.842857e-5 ft.

Convert to inches: 1.842857e-5 ft *12 in/ft≈2.211e-4 inches≈0.0002211 inches.

Wait, that's very small, about 0.00022 inches, which is much smaller than the options given, which are around 0.004 to 0.012 inches. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me recheck the units.

Wait, rho is given in lb/ft³, mu in lb/(ft·s), u* in ft/s.

Compute denominator: rho * u* = (0.07 lb/ft³) * (50 ft/s) = 3.5 lb/(ft²·s).

So y = (5 * 12.9e-6 lb/(ft·s)) / (3.5 lb/(ft²·s)) )

= (5 *12.9e-6) /3.5 ft.

= (64.5e-6)/3.5 ≈1.842857e-5 ft.

Convert to inches: 1.842857e-5 ft *12 in/ft≈2.211e-4 in≈0.000221 inches.

But the options suggest a thickness around 0.004 to 0.012 inches. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula for y+ is different. The standard definition is y+ = (y * u_tau)/nu, where nu=mu/rho.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem defines y+ as (y rho u*)/mu, which would be the same as (y * u*) * (rho /mu )= y * u* * (1/nu).

But let's proceed with the given definition.

Given y+ =5,

y = (5 * mu) / (rho * u*)

= (5 * 12.9e-6 lb/(ft·s)) / (0.07 lb/ft³ *50 ft/s )

= (64.5e-6) / (3.5 )

= 1.842857e-5 ft = 0.0002211 inches.

That's about 0.00022 inches, which is much smaller than the options. So perhaps the problem expects a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is to find the thickness of the laminar sub-layer where u+ =5.

u+ is defined as (u y)/u*.

At the edge of the laminar sub-layer, u+ =5.

We can express u as a function of y in the laminar sub-layer.

In the laminar sub-layer, the velocity profile is given by the laminar law, which is:

u(y) = u*(1 - (y/R)^2 )

But perhaps that's not applicable here. Alternatively, in the laminar sub-layer, the velocity profile can be approximated by the parabolic law, and we can find the point where u+ =5.

So, u+ = (u y)/u* =5.

But u(y) in the laminar sub-layer is given by u(y) = u* (1 - (y/R)^2 )

So substituting into u+:

( [u*(1 - (y/R)^2 ) ] * y ) / u* =5

Simplify:

y (1 - (y/R)^2 ) =5

Let me set x = y/R.

Then,

x (1 -x² ) =5/(R)

But R is in feet, and y is in inches, so I need to convert R to inches.

R=5 inches.

So,

x (1 -x² ) =5/(5) =1.

So,

x -x^3 =1

Rearranged:

x^3 -x +1=0.

This is a cubic equation. Let's solve for x.

Using trial and error:

x= -1: (-1)^3 - (-1) +1= -1+1+1=1≠0.

x=0: 0-0+1=1≠0.

x=1:1-1+1=1≠0.

x=2:8-2+1=7≠0.

Hmm, no real roots. Maybe I made a mistake in the approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the equation is x(1 -x²)=5/R, but R=5 inches, so 5/R=1.

Wait, same as before.

Alternatively, perhaps the equation is x(1 -x²)= (5 R)/y, but I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the standard formula for the laminar sub-layer thickness, which is y_c = (nu)/(rho u*) * something.

Wait, the standard thickness of the laminar sub-layer in turbulent flow is given by y_c = (nu)/(rho u*) * something, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the thickness y where u+ =5 is found by solving y(1 - (y/R)^2 ) =5.

Let me try to solve y(1 - (y/R)^2 )=5.

But R=5 inches.

Let me set y = a inches.

So,

a (1 - (a/5)^2 )=5.

So,

a - (a^3)/25 =5.

Multiply both sides by 25:

25a -a^3 =125.

Rearranged:

a^3 -25a +125=0.

Let me try possible integer roots:

a=-5: (-125) - (-125) +125=125≠0.

a=5: 125 -125 +125=125≠0.

a= -5: same as above.

No obvious roots. Perhaps using the rational root theorem, possible roots are factors of 125 over 1: ±1,±5,±25,±125.

Testing a=5: 125 -125 +125=125≠0.

a=-5: -125 +125 +125=125≠0.

No root found. So perhaps the equation has no real roots, implying that the laminar sub-layer extends beyond the pipe radius, which is not possible. Thus, perhaps the assumption is incorrect, and the equation should be solved differently.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the given options to estimate which one fits.

Looking at option I: velocities are 47.42 and 58.25 ft/s, and thickness 0.005 in.

Wait, but perhaps I should compute the velocities using the correct formula and see which option matches.

Wait, earlier I found that using the correct formula for laminar flow, the velocities at 0.4 inches and 3 inches from the wall are approximately 15.34 ft/s and 84.02 ft/s, respectively. But these don't match any options, so perhaps the problem is about turbulent flow.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about velocity in the boundary layer, but I'm not sure.

Given the time I've spent and the confusion, I'll proceed to look at the options and see which one makes sense.

Looking at the options, option I has velocities of approximately 47.42 ft/s and 58.25 ft/s, which are close to the mean velocity of 50 ft/s. The thickness is 0.005 inches, which is close to what I calculated earlier (0.00022 inches), but perhaps the problem expects a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the velocity profile in the laminar sub-layer as u(y) = u_avg * (y / R), which would give higher velocities, but I'm not sure.

Given the time I've spent, I'll make an educated guess based on the options. The only option where the velocities are close to the mean and the thickness is around 0.005 inches is option I.
</think>

The problem involves determining the velocity at two points (0.4 inches and 3 inches from the wall) in a laminar flow through a pipe and finding the thickness of the laminar sub-layer where \( y^+ = 5 \). The key steps and calculations are as follows:

1. **Velocity Profile in Laminar Flow**:  
   The velocity profile for laminar flow in a pipe is given by:  
   \[
   u(r) = u_{\text{max}} \left( 1 - \frac{r^2}{R^2} \right)
   \]  
   where \( u_{\text{max}} = 2u_{\text{avg}} \), \( R \) is the pipe radius, and \( r \) is the distance from the center. The mean velocity \( u_{\text{avg}} \) is 50 ft/s, so \( u_{\text{max}} = 100 \, \text{ft/s} \).  

   The pipe diameter is 10 inches, so the radius \( R = 5 \, \text{inches} = \frac{5}{12} \, \text{ft} \approx 0.4167 \, \text{ft} \).  

   - For \( y_1 = 0.4 \, \text{inches} \) from the wall:  
     Convert to feet: \( y_1 = \frac{0.4}{12} \approx 0.0333 \, \text{ft} \).  
     Distance from the center: \( r_1 = R - y_1 = 0.4167 - 0.0333 \approx 0.3833 \, \text{ft} \).  
     Compute \( u(r_1) \):  
     \[
     u(r_1) = 100 \left( 1 - \frac{(0.3833)^2}{(0.4167)^2} \right) \approx 100 \left( 1 - 0.8466 \right) \approx 15.34 \, \text{ft/s}.
     \]  
     This result is much lower than the options provided, suggesting a potential misunderstanding of the problem or formula.

   - For \( y_2 = 3 \, \text{inches} \) from the wall:  
     Convert to feet: \( y_2 = \frac{3}{12} = 0.25 \, \text{ft} \).  
     Distance from the center: \( r_2 = R - y_2 = 0.4167 - 0.25 = 0.1667 \, \text{ft} \).  
     Compute \( u(r_2) \):  
     \[
     u(r_2) = 100 \left( 1 - \frac{(0.1667)^2}{(0.4167)^2} \right) \approx 100 \left( 1 - 0.1598 \right) \approx 84.02 \, \text{ft/s}.
     \]  
     Again, this result does not match the options, indicating a possible error in the approach.

2. **Laminar Sub-Layer Thickness**:  
   The thickness of the laminar sub-layer is determined using \( y^+ = 5 \), defined as:  
   \[
   y^+ = \frac{y \rho u^*}{\mu}
   \]  
   where \( \rho = 0.07 \, \text{lb/ft}^3 \), \( \mu = 12.9 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{lb/ft·sec} \), and \( u^* = 50 \, \text{ft/s} \). Solving for \( y \):  
   \[
   y = \frac{y^+ \mu}{\rho u^*} = \frac{5 \cdot 12.9 \times 10^{-6}}{0.07 \cdot 50} \approx 1.842857 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{ft} \approx 0.0002211 \, \text{inches}.
   \]  
   This result is much smaller than the options provided, suggesting a discrepancy in the interpretation or formula.

3. **Matching Options**:  
   Given the mismatch between the calculated results and the options, the most plausible choice is **Option I**, which provides velocities close to the mean velocity and a thickness of \( 0.005 \, \text{inches} \), aligning more closely with the expected range.

**Answer:**  
I
