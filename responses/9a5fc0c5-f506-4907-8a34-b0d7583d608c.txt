Okay, so I've got this question here about the study of older adults and aging, and I need to pick the correct term from the options given. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that gerontology is a field related to aging. I think it's the study of the social, psychological, and biological aspects of aging. But wait, I'm not entirely sure. Let me go through the options one by one.

Option A: Gerodiversity. I don't recall hearing this term much. Maybe it's related to diversity among older adults? Not sure if that's the main term for the study of aging.

Option B: Geropsychiatry. That sounds familiar. I think this is a branch of medicine dealing with the mental health of older adults. So it's more about the psychiatric aspects rather than the general study of aging.

Option C: Geronutrition. This must be about nutrition in older adults. It's a specific area, probably focusing on dietary needs as people age.

Option D: Gerolinguistics. Hmm, that's a new one. It might deal with language changes in aging, perhaps how language ability changes with age. Not the broad study of aging as a whole.

Option E: Gerocommunication. Similar to D, maybe this is about communication in older adults, like how communication patterns change with age. Again, a specific aspect, not the overall study.

Option F: Gerocology. I think this term is used, but I'm not certain. It might be the study of the biological aspects of aging, like the biology of aging processes.

Option G: Gerontology. This rings a bell as the broader study of aging. It encompasses social, psychological, and biological factors. That sounds like the correct answer.

Option H: Geromanagement. Doesn't sound right. Maybe a management aspect of services for the elderly, but not the study itself.

Option I: Gero-education. Probably related to educational aspects for older adults, maybe lifelong learning. Not the overall study of aging.

Option J: Geriatrics. I know this is a medical specialty focusing on elderly health. So it's about the medical care of older adults, not the study of aging as a field.

So putting it together, the question is about the study of older adults and aging in general. Gerontology seems to cover all aspects, while the others are more specific areas or medical fields. Therefore, the answer should be G: Gerontology.

The correct answer is G: Gerontology, as it encompasses the comprehensive study of aging across social, psychological, and biological dimensions.
