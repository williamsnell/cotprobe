Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about Hume's view on justice. I remember that David Hume was a Scottish philosopher, and his thoughts on ethics were pretty influential. The question is asking what Hume said about the value of justice, and there are four options: A through D.

Let me start by recalling what I know about Hume's ethical philosophy. Hume was a empiricist, meaning he thought that knowledge comes from experience rather than innate ideas. He also had some specific views on morality. From what I remember, Hume believed that moral principles are derived from human sentiments and feelings rather than being based on reason alone.

Now, focusing on justice specifically. I think Hume didn't see moral properties as inherent in objects but rather as conventions that arise from human interaction. He might have considered justice to be a useful social convention because it helps maintain order and cooperation in society. 

Looking at the options:

A: has no value. That doesn't seem right because Hume likely saw some value in justice as a social construct.

B: has value in part because it is useful to society. This sounds plausible. Hume probably argued that justice is valuable because it serves societal purposes, like fairness and cooperation.

C: has value solely because it is useful to society. Hmm, this is similar to B but says 'solely.' I'm not sure if Hume would say it's the only reason or just one reason.

D: has value solely because it is useful to the agent. This seems more self-centered, like individual benefit, which I don't think aligns with Hume's emphasis on society.

Wait, I should think more about Hume's exact position. I recall that in his "A Treatise of Human Nature," Hume discussed justice as a convention that arises because it's useful. He might have thought that things like property rights and justice are useful for society's functioning, so they gain value from that utility.

So, does he think it's the only reason (C) or just part of the reason (B)? I think Hume would say that justice is valuable because it's useful, but perhaps he also considered other factors, like it being a natural part of human society. Or maybe he considered the sentiment of approbation we have towards just actions as another reason. So, if the question is about the value of justice, Hume might have said it's valuable in part because it's useful, not solely because of it.

Wait, but the options are about the reason for its value. So, if Hume says justice is useful to society, then B would be correct because it's a contributing factor, not the sole one. Or does he say it's solely because of utility?

I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. Hume's view is that moral distinctions are not based on reason but on sentiment. So, justice is a virtue that we approve of because we see it as useful. So, its value comes from its utility. But does that mean it's the only reason, or just one reason?

Wait, Hume might argue that justice is a convention that is valuable because it's useful. He might not consider other intrinsic values. So perhaps the value is because it's useful, making C correct. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe he allows that it's useful but also that it's approved of by the community, so it's part of the reason.

Wait, the options are: B says "in part because," while C says "solely because." Hume's position, as I understand it, is that justice is a human convention that arises because it's useful. So, he might say that its value is due to its utility. So, perhaps C is correct. But I'm not entirely certain. Maybe he doesn't rule out other reasons, but the primary reason is utility.

Alternatively, perhaps Hume's view is that justice is a virtue that is valuable because it promotes the public good, so its value is because it's useful to society. So maybe the answer is B, because it's one of the reasons, not the sole reason. Or perhaps he does see it as the sole reason.

Wait, I think Hume would say that justice is a useful convention, so its value is because it's useful. But does that make it solely because, or just in part? I'm a bit torn. Maybe the correct answer is B because he might acknowledge other reasons, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps Hume's view is that justice has value because it serves the public interest, which is a form of utility. So, it's the reason. So, C would be correct if it's solely because of utility. But I'm not entirely confident.

Wait, I think Hume's position is that justice has value because it's useful, but he might also consider that our approval of it contributes to its value. So, perhaps it's in part because of utility, making B correct. Alternatively, maybe he's more reductionist and says it's solely because of utility.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to remember specific quotes or passages. Hume wrote that justice is a "creature of society" and that it's "bottomed on self-interest." So, perhaps he sees it as useful to society, making its value derived from that utility. So, if the question is about the reason for its value, then it's because it's useful, which would make C correct if it's the only reason or B if it's part of the reason.

Wait, but I think Hume would argue that justice is valuable because it's useful, not because of any intrinsic worth. So, the value comes from utility, making C correct. But I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, maybe he allows that it's approved of, which adds to its value, making B correct.

Hmm, this is tricky. I think the answer is B: has value in part because it is useful to society. Because Hume might have seen it as one reason among others, like social approval. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe it's C because he's a utilitarian in this aspect, but I don't think Hume was a utilitarian. He was more of a sentimentalist.

Wait, Hume's view is that justice is a convention that's useful, so its value is because of that utility. So, perhaps the correct answer is C: has value solely because it is useful to society.

But I'm not entirely sure. I think I need to go with my initial thought that the value of justice, according to Hume, comes from its utility to society. So, the answer is C. But wait, I'm not confident because I'm mixing up whether he considers other reasons.

Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is B because he sees it as a part of the reason, not the sole reason. Hmm. I'm going to have to make a decision here. I think the more accurate answer is B: has value in part because it is useful to society. Because Hume would say that while utility is a key factor, there might be other aspects contributing to its value, like the approval of the community.

According to Hume, justice is a social convention that arises because it is useful to society. Hume believed that moral distinctions, including justice, are based on human sentiments and experiences rather than abstract reason. He emphasized that justice is valuable because it promotes fairness, cooperation, and the stability of society. While utility to society is a significant factor in Hume's view, he may also consider other aspects, such as social approval, contributing to the value of justice. Therefore, the most accurate answer is that justice has value in part because it is useful to society.

Answer: B
