Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about the properties of the OLS estimator when there's multicollinearity. I'm a bit rusty on my econometrics, but I'll try to work through this.

First, I remember that OLS stands for Ordinary Least Squares. The OLS estimator is commonly used in linear regression models. The key properties of OLS estimators under the Gauss-Markov assumptions are that they are Best Linear Unbiased Estimators (BLUE), meaning they are unbiased, consistent, and efficient. Efficiency here refers to having the smallest variance among all unbiased estimators.

But wait, the question is about what happens when multicollinearity is present. Multicollinearity refers to a situation where two or more predictor variables in a regression model are highly correlated. This can cause some issues with the OLS estimates.

So, what does multicollinearity do to the OLS estimator? I think it affects the variance of the estimates. From what I recall, when variables are highly correlated, the standard errors of the coefficients tend to increase. This means that the estimates become less precise, even though they might still be unbiased.

Let me think about the properties one by one. Unbiasedness means that on average, the estimator hits the true parameter value. Consistency means that as the sample size grows, the estimator converges to the true parameter value. Efficiency is about having the smallest variance among unbiased estimators.

In the presence of multicollinearity, does the OLS estimator remain unbiased? I believe it does. Because multicollinearity doesn't bias the estimator; it just makes the estimates less precise. So the estimator remains unbiased.

What about consistency? Consistency depends on the model being correctly specified and the regressors being exogenous (i.e., their expected value with the error term is zero). Multicollinearity doesn't affect these conditions, so the estimator should still be consistent.

Efficiency, though, is where the problem lies. Since the variance of the estimates increases due to multicollinearity, the OLS estimator is no longer the most efficient estimator. Because efficiency in BLUE terms is about having the lowest variance, when multicollinearity is present, OLS isn't efficient anymore. So the estimator loses its efficiency.

Wait, but I thought OLS is still unbiased even with multicollinearity. So the estimator remains unbiased and consistent, but it's no longer efficient. Let me check the options.

Looking at the options:

A: Not unbiased or efficient. No, because it's still unbiased.

B: Consistent and efficient, not unbiased. No, because it's still unbiased.

C: Efficient but not consistent or unbiased. No, because it's still both.

D: Efficient and unbiased, not consistent. No, because it's still consistent.

E: Consistent and unbiased, not efficient. Yes, this seems right because OLS remains unbiased and consistent but loses efficiency.

F: Not efficient. Partially correct, but it's more than just not efficient.

G: Not consistent. No, because consistency remains.

H: Consistent but not unbiased. No, because it's still unbiased.

I: Unbiased but not consistent. No, because consistency holds.

J: All three. No, because efficiency is lost.

So the correct answer should be E: It will be consistent and unbiased but not efficient.

The OLS estimator remains unbiased and consistent even in the presence of multicollinearity, but it loses efficiency as the variance of the estimates increases due to the high correlation among predictors.

Answer: E
