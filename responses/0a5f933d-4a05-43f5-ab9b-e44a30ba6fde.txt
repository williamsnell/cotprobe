Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about light traveling from water to diamond. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on optics, but I'll try to work through it. Let me see what the question is asking.

The question says that light is traveling from water with a refractive index of 1.33 to diamond, which has a refractive index of 2.42. The angle of incidence is 13 degrees, and I need to find the angle of refraction. The options are from A to J, so I'll have to calculate it and pick the correct one.

Alright, I remember that when light moves from one medium to another, the angle of refraction is determined by Snell's Law. Snell's Law states that the ratio of the sine of the angle of incidence to the sine of the angle of refraction is equal to the ratio of the refractive indices of the two media. The formula is n1*sin(theta1) = n2*sin(theta2), where n1 is the refractive index of the first medium, theta1 is the incidence angle, n2 is the second medium's index, and theta2 is the refraction angle.

Wait, but in this case, light is moving from water (n1=1.33) to diamond (n2=2.42). So water is the first medium, and diamond is the second. So I should write the equation as 1.33 * sin(13 degrees) = 2.42 * sin(theta2). I need to solve for theta2.

Let me get my calculator out. First, calculate sin(13 degrees). I think 13 degrees is a small angle, so the sine should be around 0.2249 maybe? Let me check: sin(10) is about 0.1736, sin(15) is around 0.2588, so 13 should be in between. Let's compute it precisely.

Using calculator mode: sin(13) is approximately 0.22495. So 1.33 multiplied by 0.22495. Let me compute that. 1.33 * 0.22495 ≈ 0.299. So the left side of the equation is approximately 0.299.

Now, the equation is 0.299 = 2.42 * sin(theta2). To find sin(theta2), I'll divide both sides by 2.42. So 0.299 / 2.42 ≈ 0.1235.

Now, I need to find theta2 by taking the inverse sine (arcsin) of 0.1235. Let me calculate that. I know that arcsin(0.1) is about 5.74 degrees, and arcsin(0.12) is around 6.99 degrees. Since 0.1235 is close to 0.12, maybe around 7 degrees? Wait, let me get a more precise value.

Using a calculator: arcsin(0.1235) is approximately 7.11 degrees. So the angle of refraction is about 7.1 degrees. Looking at the options, option G is 7.1 degrees. So that's probably the correct answer.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. First, Snell's Law: n1 sin(theta1) = n2 sin(theta2). So 1.33 * sin(13) = 2.42 * sin(theta2). Sin(13) ≈ 0.22495, so 1.33 * 0.22495 ≈ 0.299. Then 0.299 divided by 2.42 is approximately 0.1235. Arcsin(0.1235) is indeed around 7.1 degrees. So yes, option G.

The angle of refraction is calculated using Snell's Law: n₁ sin(θ₁) = n₂ sin(θ₂). Substituting the given values, sin(θ₂) ≈ 0.1235, leading to θ₂ ≈ 7.1 degrees. 

Answer: G
