Okay, so I've got this question about norms and inner products. Hmm, I remember from my linear algebra class that norms and inner products are related but not all norms can be expressed as inner products. Let me try to think this through.

The question is asking for which p the norm ||x||_p is expressible as an inner product. The options are various values and ranges of p. I think this is about the p-norm on real vector spaces. 

Wait, right, an inner product has to satisfy certain properties, like linearity in the first argument, conjugate symmetry, and positive definiteness. But more importantly, for a norm to come from an inner product, it must satisfy the parallelogram law. Oh right, the parallelogram law is a necessary and sufficient condition for a norm to be induced by an inner product.

So the parallelogram law states that for any vectors x and y, ||x + y||² + ||x - y||² = 2||x||² + 2||y||². Now, I remember that only for p=2 does the p-norm satisfy the parallelogram law. So that means only the Euclidean norm (p=2) can be expressed as an inner product. 

Let me think about the other options. For p=1, the taxicab norm, does it satisfy the parallelogram law? I don't think so. For example, take x = (1,0) and y = (0,1). Then ||x + y||₁ = 2, ||x - y||₁ is also 2. So 2² + 2² = 8. On the other side, 2*(1)² + 2*(1)² = 4. 8 ≠ 4, so it doesn't hold. So p=1 isn't good.

What about p=infinity? That's the max norm. Let's test it too. Take x=(1,0), y=(0,1). ||x+y||_inf is 1, same as ||x−y||_inf. So 1² + 1² = 2. On the other side, 2*(1)² + 2*(1)² = 4. 2≠4, so that's no good either.

What about p=3? I think higher p's than 2 don't satisfy the parallelogram law either. Because the p-norm only satisfies the parallelogram law when p=2. Other p's don't satisfy it, so their norms aren't derived from inner products.

So the only p where ||x||_p is an inner product is p=2. Looking at the options, option D is p=2. Let me check the options again: D is 2, so that's the correct answer.

The norm ||x||_p can be expressed as an inner product only when p=2, as it satisfies the parallelogram law. 

Answer: D
