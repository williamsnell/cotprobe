Okay, so I have this logic problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about constructing a truth table for a given argument and then determining if it's valid or invalid. If it's invalid, I need to pick a counterexample from the options provided.

The argument given is:
1. ~X ⊃ Y
2. Y ⊃ Z
3. ~Z / ~X

Wait, I think the last line is the conclusion, so the premises are the first two statements, and the conclusion is ~X. So the argument is: If ~X then Y, and if Y then Z, therefore if not Z, then not X. Or, in other words, from ~Z we conclude ~X.

First, I need to construct the truth table for all possible combinations of X, Y, and Z. Since there are three variables, there are 2^3 = 8 possible rows.

Let me list the variables: X, Y, Z. For each, they can be T (true) or F (false). So the rows will be all combinations of T and F for X, Y, Z.

Now, the statements are:
1. ~X → Y
2. Y → Z
3. The conclusion is ~Z → ~X.

Wait, no, the conclusion is ~X, but the way it's written is ~Z / ~X, which I think represents the inference from ~Z to ~X. So the argument is: If ~Z, then ~X. So the premises are ~X→Y and Y→Z, and the conclusion is ~Z→~X. But actually, the way it's written, the conclusion is ~X given that ~Z, so maybe the argument is: From ~Z, infer ~X. But perhaps the argument is structured as the two premises leading to the conclusion that ~Z implies ~X. Alternatively, maybe it's a single conclusion that ~X, but I think I need to clarify that.

Wait, perhaps the argument is: Given that ~X implies Y, and Y implies Z, then if ~Z is true, then ~X must be true. So the conclusion is ~Z → ~X. So the argument is: ~X→Y, Y→Z, therefore, ~Z→~X.

Alternatively, maybe the conclusion is simply ~X, but I think it's more likely that the conclusion is an implication: ~Z implies ~X, which would make the argument valid or invalid based on whether the premises necessarily lead to that conclusion.

Wait, but the way it's written is ~Z / ~X, which in some logic notations represents the inference from ~Z to ~X. So the argument is: If ~Z, then ~X. So the premises are ~X→Y and Y→Z, and the conclusion is ~Z→~X. So we need to check if the premises entail the conclusion.

Alternatively, perhaps the conclusion is that ~X is true given ~Z, so it's a direct inference. Hmm, I might be overcomplicating. Let me proceed step by step.

First, I'll construct the truth table for all three variables X, Y, Z. Then, compute the truth values for each premise and the conclusion.

Variables: X, Y, Z.

Each can be T or F, so 8 rows.

Let's list them:

1. X=T, Y=T, Z=T
2. X=T, Y=T, Z=F
3. X=T, Y=F, Z=T
4. X=T, Y=F, Z=F
5. X=F, Y=T, Z=T
6. X=F, Y=T, Z=F
7. X=F, Y=F, Z=T
8. X=F, Y=F, Z=F

Now, for each row, I'll compute the truth values for ~X, ~Z, and then for each premise and the conclusion.

The premises are:
1. ~X → Y
2. Y → Z

The conclusion is: ~Z → ~X

Wait, no, the conclusion as per the argument is that ~X follows from ~Z, so the conclusion is ~Z → ~X. Alternatively, perhaps the argument is that from ~Z, we can conclude ~X, which would be the same as ~Z → ~X.

Wait, no, in the argument, the premises are ~X→Y and Y→Z, and the conclusion is ~X, but the way it's written is ~Z / ~X, which I think means that if ~Z is true, then ~X must be true. So the conclusion is an implication: ~Z → ~X.

So the argument is: If ~X→Y and Y→Z are true, then ~Z→~X must be true.

So the conclusion is an implication: ~Z implies ~X.

So I need to check whether in all cases where both premises are true, the conclusion is also true. If there's any case where premises are true but conclusion is false, then the argument is invalid, and that case would be a counterexample.

Alternatively, if in every row where both premises are true, the conclusion is also true, then the argument is valid.

So let's compute each row.

Row 1: X=T, Y=T, Z=T

Compute ~X: F

~X→Y: T (because F→T is T)

Y→Z: T (T→T is T)

~Z: F

~Z→~X: T (because F→F is T)

So in this row, premises are T and T, conclusion is T.

Row 2: X=T, Y=T, Z=F

~X: F

~X→Y: T

Y→Z: F (T→F is F)

So premises: T and F. Since the second premise is F, the argument's premises aren't both true, so this row doesn't affect the validity.

Row 3: X=T, Y=F, Z=T

~X: F

~X→Y: T

Y→Z: F (F→T is T, wait no: Y is F, Z is T. Y→Z is T because F→T is T.

Wait, Y→Z is Y implies Z. Y is F, Z is T. So F→T is T.

So premises: T and T.

~Z: F

~Z→~X: T (F→F is T)

So conclusion is T.

Row 4: X=T, Y=F, Z=F

~X: F

~X→Y: T

Y→Z: F (Y=F, Z=F → F→F is T)

So premises: T and T.

~Z: T

~Z→~X: T→F (since ~X is F) → F.

So in this row, premises are both T, but conclusion is F.

So this is a counterexample: when X=T, Y=F, Z=F.

In this case, both premises are true, but the conclusion is false. So the argument is invalid.

Now, let's look at the options to find which one matches this counterexample.

The options are:

D: Invalid. Counterexample when X is true and Y and Z are false.

So that's exactly what we have here: X=T, Y=F, Z=F.

So the answer would be D.

Wait, but let me check the other rows to make sure I didn't miss anything.

Row 5: X=F, Y=T, Z=T

~X: T

~X→Y: T→T is T

Y→Z: T→T is T

~Z: F

~Z→~X: F→T is T

So conclusion is T.

Row 6: X=F, Y=T, Z=F

~X: T

~X→Y: T→T is T

Y→Z: T→F is F

So premises: T and F. Doesn't matter for validity.

Row 7: X=F, Y=F, Z=T

~X: T

~X→Y: T→F is F

Y→Z: F→T is T

So premises: F and T. Doesn't matter.

Row 8: X=F, Y=F, Z=F

~X: T

~X→Y: T→F is F

Y→Z: F→F is T

So premises: F and T. Doesn't matter.

So only in row 4 do we have both premises true, but conclusion false. So that's the counterexample.

So the argument is invalid, and the counterexample is when X is true, Y is false, and Z is false. So option D.

Let me check the options again.

Option D says: Invalid. Counterexample when Y is true and X and Z are false. Wait no, D says "when Y is true and X and Z are false." Wait no, D says "when X is true and Y and Z are false." Yes, that's correct.

Wait, looking back: option D is "Invalid. Counterexample when X is true and Y and Z are false." Yes, that's exactly row 4.

The argument is invalid, and the counterexample occurs when X is true, Y is false, and Z is false.

Answer: D
