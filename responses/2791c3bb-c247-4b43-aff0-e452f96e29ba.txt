Alright, so I've got this multiple-choice question about experimental outcomes and which is the least informative. Let me try to break it down.

The question is asking which outcome is the least informative. The options are about statistical significance and power. I remember that power relates to the probability of correctly rejecting a false null hypothesis. High power means a better chance of detecting an effect if there is one.

Looking at the options:
A: Statistical nonsignificance under low power
B: Statistical significance under low power
C: Statistical nonsignificance under high power
D: Statistical significance under high power

I think statistical significance under high power (D) would be pretty informative because it means we've likely found a true effect. Conversely, statistical nonsignificance under high power (C) would also be informative because it suggests there's no effect, given that the test was well-powered.

Now, the less informative ones are probably A and B. If the power is low, the experiment might not have been able to detect an effect even if there was one (Type II error). So, if you get nonsignificance under low power (A), it's hard to tell if it's a true negative or a false negative because the test might not have been sensitive enough. Similarly, significance under low power (B) could be a true positive, but maybe it's just due to low power not catching it, making it less reliable.

Between A and B, which is less informative? I think statistical nonsignificance under low power (A) is the least informative because it doesn't give much information—maybe the effect doesn't exist, or maybe the experiment just didn't have enough power. In contrast, significance under low power (B) might be a meaningful finding, but it's less certain than with high power. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, another angle: high power means the test is good at finding effects. So, if you have nonsignificance under high power (C), it's more convincing that there's no effect. But if you have significance under low power (B), it's less convincing because you might have committed a Type I error or the effect size is small. However, the least informative would be when the result is ambiguous. So, A (nonsignificant under low power) is ambiguous because you can't tell if the effect is small or non-existent. So A might be the least informative.

I'm leaning towards A as the least informative because low power makes the result uncertain—whether the effect exists or not, you can't really tell.

The least informative outcome is when the experiment fails to detect a significant result under low power, as it doesn't provide clear evidence either way due to the test's limited sensitivity.

Answer: A
