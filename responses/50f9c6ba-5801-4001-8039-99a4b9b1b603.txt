Okay, so I've got this physics question here about rotational inertia. Hmm, I remember rotational inertia is also called moment of inertia, right? It's a measure of how difficult it is to rotate an object around a particular axis. The bigger the moment of inertia, the harder it is to spin the object.

The question is asking when the rotational inertia is greater. The options are from A to J, and I need to pick the correct one. Let me think about what I learned in class. The formula for moment of inertia is I = ∑mr², where m is mass and r is the distance from the axis of rotation. So, the farther the mass is from the axis, the more it contributes to the moment of inertia.

So, if most of the mass is located far away from the axis, the moment of inertia increases. That makes sense because each mass particle contributes more due to the r squared term. Conversely, if the mass is close to the axis, their contributions are smaller.

Looking at the options, let's go through them one by one. Option A says at the ends of the object. If the object is, say, a rod rotating about its end, then the mass is at the end, so that would increase inertia. But the question is about where most of the mass is located. So if the mass is distributed towards the ends, that would mean higher inertia.

Option B says on the rotational axis. That would mean the mass is right at the center, so r=0, contributing nothing to inertia. So inertia would be low here.

Option C is at the bottom. If it's a vertical object, like a hanging rod, the bottom would be at a distance from the axis, so that's farther, which increases inertia. But the question isn't specifying the axis, so maybe it's more about the general case.

Option D is at the center. That's like option B; mass at the center doesn't contribute much. So inertia is lower here.

Option E is at the top. Similar to option C, the top being far from the axis would mean higher inertia. But again, depends on the axis.

Option F says near the rotational axis. That's the opposite of what we want. If mass is near the axis, r is small, so I is small. So option F would lower inertia.

Option G is equally distributed. That would be an average case, but if the mass is spread out, depending on the shape, it could vary. For example, a solid sphere has lower I than a hollow sphere of the same mass because the mass is distributed closer in the solid case. So equal distribution might not necessarily maximize I unless the object is like a ring or something.

Option H is away from the axis. Oh, wait, this directly relates. If the mass is located away from the axis, each mass element has a larger r, so I increases. So this seems correct.

Option I is at one side. That might be a bit vague. If the object is off-center, but the question is about the distribution of mass. If most mass is on one side, that could increase inertia, but it's not as direct as being away from the axis.

Option J is off center. Hmm, off center would mean the axis isn't through the center of mass, but the question is about the distribution of the mass relative to the axis. So maybe it's not the same as the axis being off-center.

Wait, so the key point is that the moment of inertia depends on how the mass is distributed relative to the axis. The more mass is farther away, the higher the I. So the question is asking when I is greater. So the correct answer should be when most of the mass is away from the axis.

Looking back at the options, option H is "away from the axis." That fits because if the mass is away, r is larger, so I increases.

The rotational inertia (moment of inertia) of an object is greater when most of its mass is located farther from the axis of rotation. This is because the moment of inertia depends on the distribution of mass relative to the axis, with the formula \( I = \sum mr^2 \), where \( r \) is the distance from the axis. When mass is farther away (\( r \) is larger), the contribution to the moment of inertia increases. Among the options, "away from the axis" (H) directly aligns with this principle, as it indicates that the mass is distributed farther from the rotational axis, leading to a higher moment of inertia.

Answer: H
