<think>
Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about finding the resistivity of copper at a certain temperature. Hmm, I remember that resistivity is a material property, right? The formula I think is R = ρ * (L/A), where R is resistance, ρ is resistivity, L is length, and A is the cross-sectional area. Oh wait, yeah, that's right.

The problem says the wire is 2500 cm long. Wait, but usually in formulas, we use meters. Oh right, I might need to convert units. The diameter is 0.90 cm, so radius would be half of that, which is 0.45 cm. The resistance is given as 0.67 ohms at 20°C. So I need to find ρ.

First, let me write down the formula rearranged to solve for ρ. So ρ = R * (A/L). Since A is the area, which is πr². Let me make sure I get all the units right because that's where mistakes often happen.

The length L is 2500 cm. Oh, I should convert that to meters. 2500 cm is 25 meters because 100 cm = 1m. So L = 25 m.

The diameter is 0.90 cm, so radius r is 0.45 cm. To meters, that's 0.0045 meters. So the area A is π*(0.0045)^2. Let me calculate that. 0.0045 squared is 0.00002025, so A ≈ π * 0.00002025. Let me compute π*0.00002025. Hmm, π is about 3.1416, so 3.1416 * 0.00002025 is approximately 6.36 x 10^-5 m².

Wait, but wait. Oh, wait, the resistivity is usually given in ohm-meters, but some options are in ohm-centimeters. Oh right, because 1 ohm-meter is 100 ohm-centimeters. Because 1 m = 100 cm. So if I calculate ρ in ohm-meters, I might need to convert it to ohm-cm. Or alternatively, I can work in centimeters to make it easier.

Let me try working in centimeters. So, L is 2500 cm, r is 0.45 cm, so area A is π*(0.45)^2 cm². Let me compute that: 0.45 squared is 0.2025 cm², so A = π * 0.2025 ≈ 0.6362 cm².

Now, R is 0.67 ohms, L is 2500 cm, A is about 0.6362 cm². So using ρ = R * (L/A). Plugging in the numbers: ρ = 0.67 * (2500 / 0.6362).

Wait, let me compute 2500 divided by 0.6362. Let me see: 2500 / 0.6362 ≈ 3928. So ρ ≈ 0.67 * 3928 ≈ 2632 ohm*cm. Wait, that can't be right because the options are like 1e-6 ohm-cm. Oh wait no, wait. Oh no, I think I messed up units somewhere.

Wait, maybe I should have used meters for area and length. Let me try that approach again. Let's use SI units everywhere.

Length L = 2500 cm = 25 m. Radius r = 0.45 cm = 0.0045 m. Area A = π*(0.0045)^2. 0.0045 squared is 0.00002025 m², so A ≈ 3.1416 * 0.00002025 ≈ 6.363e-5 m².

Resistance R = 0.67 ohms. So ρ = R * (L/A) = 0.67 * (25 / 6.363e-5). Let me compute 25 divided by 6.363e-5. 25 / 0.00006363 ≈ 25 * 157,000 (approximate because 1/0.00006363 is about 15700). Wait, 6.363e-5 is 0.00006363. 25 / 0.00006363 ≈ 25 * (1 / 0.00006363) = 25 * 15700 ≈ 392,500.

So ρ ≈ 0.67 * 392,500 ≈ 262, 0.67 * 392,500. Let me calculate: 0.67 * 400,000 is 268,000, but since it's 392,500, it's a bit less. Let me compute 0.67 * 392,500.

392,500 * 0.67: 392,500 * 0.6 = 235,500 ; 392,500 * 0.07 = 27,475. So total is 235,500 +27,475 = 262,975 ohm-meter.

Wait, but resistivity of copper is around 1.7e-8 ohm-meter at 20°C. Oh wait, that's 1.7 x10^-8 ohm·m. If I convert that to ohm·cm, since 1 ohm·m = 100 ohm·cm, so 1.7e-8 ohm·m = 1.7e-6 ohm·cm. Oh, so that's option E: 1.7e-6 ohm-cm.

Wait, but according to my calculation, I got ρ ≈ 262,975 ohm-meter, which is 2.62975e5 ohm-meter. That's way off. I must have messed up somewhere.

Wait, let me check the formula again. Oh! Wait a second, the formula is R = ρ * (L/A), so ρ = R * (A/L). So I think I made a mistake in rearrangement earlier.

So the correct formula is ρ = R * (A / L). Oh, yes, I think I had it correct earlier. But wait, let me recheck the calculation.

So, A is 6.363e-5 m², L is 25 m.

So A/L = 6.363e-5 /25 = 2.5452e-6 m²/m. So R is 0.67 ohms.

So ρ = 0.67 * (2.5452e-6) = approx 1.703e-6 ohm·m. Wait, no, wait. Oh no, because 0.67 * 2.5452e-6 is 1.703e-6 ohm·m. Wait, 1 ohm·m is 100 ohm·cm, so 1.703e-6 ohm·m is 1.703e-4 ohm·cm. Wait, that can't be right because that would be 0.00017 ohm·cm, but the options are 1e-6 and so on. Hmm, I must have messed up the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating A/L. Let me do it again.

A = π r². r is 0.0045 m. So r² = 0.0045^2 = 0.00002025 m². So A = π * 0.00002025 ≈ 6.363e-5 m².

L is 25 m. So A/L = 6.363e-5 / 25 = 2.5452e-6 m⁻¹.

So ρ = R * (A/L) = 0.67 * 2.5452e-6 = 1.703e-6 ohm·m.

Wait, but that's 1.703e-6 ohm·m, which is 170.3e-6 ohm·cm, because 1 ohm·m = 100 ohm·cm. Wait, wait, no: 1 ohm·m = 100 ohm·cm. So 1.703e-6 ohm·m equals 1.703e-4 ohm·cm, which is 0.0001703 ohm·cm. That's much larger than the options given. The options are around 1e-6 ohm·cm. So I'm not getting the right order of magnitude. I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should use the correct formula. Let me try again.

Wait, maybe I messed up the unit conversions. Let's try working entirely in centimeters and ohm·cm.

So, L = 2500 cm, diameter = 0.90 cm, so radius = 0.45 cm.

Area A = π*(0.45 cm)^2 = π*(0.2025 cm²) ≈ 0.6362 cm².

Resistance R = 0.67 ohms.

So ρ = R * (L/A) = 0.67 * (2500 / 0.6362) ohm·cm.

Calculate 2500 / 0.6362: approx 3928. So 0.67 * 3928 ≈ 2628 ohm·cm.

Wait, that's way too high. Because copper's resistivity is around 1.7e-6 ohm·cm, as I recalled earlier. So I'm getting a value of around 2600 ohm·cm, which is way off. So I must have messed up the formula.

Wait, wait a minute, maybe I inverted A and L. Because the formula is R = ρ*(L/A), so ρ = R*(A/L). So I think I did it correctly. Let me compute again.

Wait, in cm:

A = π*(0.45)^2 = π*0.2025 ≈ 0.6362 cm².

L = 2500 cm.

So A/L = 0.6362 / 2500 ≈ 0.00025448 cm⁻¹.

So ρ = R * (A/L) = 0.67 ohms * 0.00025448 cm⁻¹. Wait, no, because R is in ohms, and A/L is in cm²/cm = cm. So ρ would be ohms * cm, but wait, that can’t be because resistivity is ohm·cm. Wait, no, maybe I'm confusing units.

Wait, R has units of ohms.

A is in cm², L in cm, so A/L is cm.

So R*(A/L) has units of ohms * cm, which is ohm·cm.

So 0.67 ohms * 0.00025448 cm ≈ 0.67 * 0.00025448 ≈ 0.0001703 ohm·cm.

That's 1.703e-4 ohm·cm. But wait, that's 0.00017 ohm·cm, which is 1.7e-4 ohm·cm. But the options are like 1e-6. So that's way off. I must have done something wrong.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me double-check the formula. Resistivity ρ is given by R = ρ*(L/A), so ρ = R*(A/L). Yes, that's correct.

Wait, maybe I should use meters for A and L. Let me try that.

L = 25 m.

r = 0.45 cm = 0.0045 m.

A = π*(0.0045)^2 = π * 0.00002025 ≈ 6.363e-5 m².

So A = 6.363e-5 m².

L = 25 m.

So A/L = 6.363e-5 / 25 = 2.5452e-6 m⁻¹.

R is 0.67 ohms.

So ρ = R * (A/L) = 0.67 * 2.5452e-6 = approximately 1.703e-6 ohm·m.

But wait, 1 ohm·m is equal to 100 ohm·cm. So 1.703e-6 ohm·m is 1.703e-4 ohm·cm. Which is 0.0001703 ohm·cm. That's much larger than the options given, which are on the order of 1e-6 ohm·cm. So something's wrong.

Wait a minute, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Oh wait! The formula is correct, but perhaps the area calculation is wrong. Let me recalculate A.

r = 0.45 cm = 0.0045 m.

A = π*(0.0045)^2 = π*(0.00002025) = 6.3617e-5 m².

Yes, correct.

Wait, perhaps I should compute A as (π d²)/4, since diameter is given. Let me try that.

d = 0.90 cm = 0.009 m.

A = (π * (0.009)^2 ) /4 = π * 0.000081 /4 = π * 0.00002025 ≈ 6.3617e-5 m². Same as before.

Hmm, perhaps I should check the calculation of A/L again.

A = 6.3617e-5 m².

L = 25 m.

A/L = 6.3617e-5 /25 = 2.54468e-6 m⁻¹.

R = 0.67 ohms.

So ρ = R*(A/L) = 0.67 * 2.54468e-6 ≈ 1.703e-6 ohm·m.

Wait, but 1 ohm·m is 100 ohm·cm, so 1.703e-6 ohm·m is 1.703e-4 ohm·cm. Which is 0.0001703 ohm·cm. But the options are 1e-6 ohm·cm. So I must have a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I confused the formula. Oh! Wait a second, no, the formula is correct. Let me think again. Maybe I messed up the units when calculating.

Wait, if I work in centimeters, maybe I should keep everything in cm. Let me try that.

L = 2500 cm.

d = 0.90 cm.

r = 0.45 cm.

A = π*(0.45)^2 = π * 0.2025 ≈ 0.6362 cm².

R = 0.67 ohms.

So ρ = R * (A / L) = 0.67 * (0.6362 / 2500) ohm·cm.

Calculate 0.6362 /2500: that's 0.00025448.

So 0.67 * 0.00025448 ≈ 0.0001703 ohm·cm. Which is 1.703e-4 ohm·cm. But the options are in 1e-6 range. I'm getting a value that's 100 times larger than expected.

Wait, that can't be right. Oh, wait, wait! Maybe I misapplied the units. Because when using the formula, if A is in cm² and L in cm, then A/L is cm. So R*(A/L) gives R in ohms multiplied by (cm), which would give ohm·cm, which is correct.

But in reality, the resistivity of copper is known to be around 1.7 x10^-8 ohm·m, which is 1.7 x10^-6 ohm·cm. So I'm getting an answer that's 100 times higher than that, which suggests I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps I should check the formula again. Oh wait! Oh no, I think I inverted the formula. Oh no, no, R = ρ*(L/A), so ρ = R*(A/L). That's correct. So where is the mistake?

Wait, perhaps the length was given as 2500 cm, which is 25 meters, that's correct. The diameter is 0.90 cm, so radius 0.45 cm, which is 0.0045 m. So area in m² is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should compute using the correct formula in terms of diameter. Let me try that approach.

The formula for resistance is R = (ρ * L) / (π r²). But since diameter d = 2r, r = d/2. So R = (ρ L) / (π (d/2)^2 ) = (4 ρ L) / (π d²).

So rearranging for ρ: ρ = (R π d²) / (4 L).

Let me plug in the numbers using this formula.

R = 0.67 ohms.

d = 0.90 cm = 0.009 m.

L = 2500 cm = 25 m.

So ρ = (0.67 * π * (0.009)^2) / (4 * 25).

Let me compute numerator and denominator separately.

Numerator: 0.67 * π * (0.009)^2.

(0.009)^2 = 0.000081.

So 0.67 * π * 0.000081 ≈ 0.67 * 3.1416 * 0.000081 ≈ 0.67 * 0.00025447 ≈ 0.00016979.

Denominator: 4 *25 = 100.

So ρ ≈ 0.00016979 / 100 = 0.0000016979 ohm·m.

Which is 1.6979e-6 ohm·m. Converting to ohm·cm: 1.6979e-6 ohm·m * 100 = 1.6979e-4 ohm·cm. Wait, that's the same as before, not matching the expected value. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should use the correct formula. Oh wait! I think I see the problem. The formula I used gives ρ in ohm·m, but the options are in ohm·cm. So 1.6979e-6 ohm·m is equal to 1.6979e-4 ohm·cm, which is 0.00016979 ohm·cm. But the known resistivity is about 1.7e-6 ohm·cm. So I'm getting a value that's 100 times larger than expected. Where did I go wrong?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check the numbers again.

Using ρ = (R π d²) / (4 L).

R = 0.67 ohms.

d = 0.90 cm → 0.009 m.

d² = (0.009)^2 = 0.000081 m².

L = 25 m.

So numerator: 0.67 * π * 0.000081.

0.67 * 3.1416 ≈ 2.104.

2.104 * 0.000081 ≈ 0.0001703.

Denominator: 4 *25 = 100.

So ρ = 0.0001703 / 100 = 0.000001703 ohm·m.

Which is 1.703e-6 ohm·m. Convert to ohm·cm: 1.703e-6 * 100 = 1.703e-4 ohm·cm. Wait, that's 0.0001703 ohm·cm. But the correct resistivity is about 1.7e-6 ohm·cm. So I'm getting a value that's off by a factor of 100. So where is the mistake?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me double-check the formula.

The correct formula for resistance is R = ρ(L)/(A), where A is the cross-sectional area. A = π r² = π (d/2)^2 = π d² /4. So R = ρ L / (π d² /4) ) → R = (4 ρ L) / (π d²). 

So rearranged for ρ: ρ = (R π d²) / (4 L). That's correct.

Wait, but if I plug in R = 0.67, d = 0.009 m, L=25 m, I get ρ = (0.67 * π * 0.000081) / (4 *25).

Wait, 0.67 * π ≈ 2.104.

2.104 * 0.000081 ≈ 0.0001703.

Divide by 100 (4*25): 0.0001703 / 100 = 0.000001703 ohm·m → 1.703e-6 ohm·m → 1.703e-4 ohm·cm.

But that's not matching the known value, which is about 1.7e-6 ohm·cm. So I must have a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should use the correct units throughout. Let me try using centimeters for d, and convert everything accordingly.

d = 0.90 cm → radius r = 0.45 cm.

L = 2500 cm.

R = 0.67 ohms.

Area A = π r² = π (0.45)^2 = π * 0.2025 ≈ 0.6362 cm².

So R = ρ (L/A) → ρ = R (A/L).

So ρ = 0.67 * (0.6362 / 2500) ohm·cm.

0.6362 / 2500 = 0.00025448.

0.67 * 0.00025448 = 0.0001703 ohm·cm.

Which is 1.703e-4 ohm·cm.

Wait, but that's way higher than the known value of 1.7e-6 ohm·cm. I'm getting a value 100 times larger. So where's the mistake?

Wait, perhaps the formula uses meters, so I should have kept everything in meters. Let me try that again.

d = 0.90 cm = 0.009 m.

r = 0.0045 m.

A = π (0.0045)^2 = π * 0.00002025 ≈ 6.363e-5 m².

L = 25 m.

R = 0.67 ohms.

So R = ρ L / A → ρ = R A / L.

So ρ = 0.67 * 6.363e-5 / 25.

Calculate numerator: 0.67 * 6.363e-5 ≈ 4.264e-5.

Divide by 25: 4.264e-5 /25 = 1.7056e-6 ohm·m.

Which is 1.7056e-6 ohm·m → 1.7056e-4 ohm·cm.

Again, same result. So I'm getting 1.7e-4 ohm·cm, but the expected value is 1.7e-6 ohm·cm. So I'm off by a factor of 100. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the area calculation. Let me check:

r = 0.0045 m.

r² = (0.0045)^2 = 0.00002025 m².

A = π * 0.00002025 ≈ 6.363e-5 m². Correct.

So 0.67 * 6.363e-5 = 4.264e-5.

4.264e-5 / 25 = 1.7056e-6 ohm·m. Correct.

Wait, so the calculation seems correct, but it's not matching the known value. So perhaps the problem is that the given resistance is at 20°C, but the resistivity might vary with temperature. But the question is asking for the resistivity at 20°C, so that shouldn't be an issue.

Alternatively, perhaps I've confused the formula. Let me think again. Oh! Wait a second, no, the formula is correct. So why is the calculated value off by a factor of 100?

Wait, perhaps the given length is 2500 cm, which is 25 meters, correct. The diameter is 0.90 cm, correct. So the only thing I can think of is that perhaps I should have used the radius in centimeters instead of meters. Let me try that.

r = 0.45 cm.

A = π*(0.45 cm)^2 = π * 0.2025 cm² ≈ 0.6362 cm².

L = 2500 cm.

So ρ = R * (A / L) = 0.67 * (0.6362 / 2500) ohm·cm.

Which is 0.67 * 0.00025448 ≈ 0.0001703 ohm·cm, same as before.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the formula expects the area in m² and length in meters, but the resistivity in ohm·cm. So 1.7056e-6 ohm·m is 1.7056e-4 ohm·cm, which is 0.00017056 ohm·cm. But that's way higher than the expected 1.7e-6 ohm·cm. So I'm not getting the right answer.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I've mixed up the formula. Let me try using the formula in terms of diameter again, but perhaps I made a mistake there.

Wait, the formula is R = (ρ L) / (A), and A = π (d/2)^2 = π d² /4. So R = (ρ L *4) / (π d²). So ρ = (R π d²) / (4 L).

Plugging in the numbers:

R = 0.67 ohms.

d = 0.009 m.

d² = 0.000081 m².

L = 25 m.

So ρ = (0.67 * π * 0.000081) / (4 *25).

0.67 * π ≈ 2.104.

2.104 * 0.000081 ≈ 0.0001703.

Divide by 100 (4*25=100): 0.0001703 /100 = 0.000001703 ohm·m → 1.703e-6 ohm·m → 1.703e-4 ohm·cm.

Same result. So I'm back to the same issue. I must have made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the resistance given is in ohms, but I should have converted it to something else. Or perhaps I forgot a conversion factor.

Wait, perhaps the correct resistivity is around 1.7e-8 ohm·m, which is 1.7e-6 ohm·cm. Let me compute using that.

If I take ρ = 1.7e-8 ohm·m, then R = ρ L / A.

Let me calculate R with ρ =1.7e-8 ohm·m.

A =6.363e-5 m².

L=25 m.

R = (1.7e-8 *25) /6.363e-5.

1.7e-8 *25 = 4.25e-7.

4.25e-7 /6.363e-5 ≈ 0.00668 ohms.

But the given R is 0.67 ohms, which is 100 times higher. So that suggests that the resistivity is 100 times higher, which would make ρ = 1.7e-6 ohm·m, which is 1.7e-4 ohm·cm. But that's not matching any of the options.

Wait, but the options don't include 1.7e-4 ohm·cm. The options are all around 1e-6 ohm·cm. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should check if the problem gave the diameter as 0.90 meters, but no, it says 0.90 cm. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should try using the formula with the correct answer. Let's say the correct answer is option E: 1.7e-6 ohm·cm.

So ρ =1.7e-6 ohm·cm.

Convert to ohm·m: 1.7e-6 /100 =1.7e-8 ohm·m.

Then R = ρ L / A.

A =6.363e-5 m².

L =25 m.

R = (1.7e-8 *25) /6.363e-5.

1.7e-8 *25 =4.25e-7.

Divide by6.363e-5: 4.25e-7 /6.363e-5 ≈ 0.00668 ohms.

But the given R is 0.67 ohms, which is 100 times higher. So this suggests that the resistivity should be 1.7e-6 ohm·m, which is 1.7e-4 ohm·cm, but that's not an option.

Wait, but the options are A to J, and option E is 1.7e-6 ohm·cm. So perhaps the correct answer is option E.

But according to my calculation, using the given data, I'm getting a value that's 100 times larger than the known resistivity. So perhaps the mistake is in the problem statement, or perhaps I'm missing a step.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the formula uses the radius in meters, but I used diameter. Or perhaps I made a mistake in the area calculation.

Wait, let me try using the radius in cm instead of meters. So r =0.45 cm.

A = π*(0.45 cm)^2 = π*(0.2025 cm²) ≈ 0.6362 cm².

L =2500 cm.

R =0.67 ohms.

So R = ρ (L/A) → ρ = R (A/L) =0.67 * (0.6362/2500) ohm·cm.

Which is 0.67 * 0.00025448 ≈0.0001703 ohm·cm → 1.703e-4 ohm·cm.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct answer is E:1.7e-6 ohm·cm, but according to calculation, it's not matching. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula is R = (ρ L) / (A), so ρ = R A / L.

Yes, that's correct.

So using R=0.67, A=6.363e-5 m², L=25 m.

ρ = 0.67 *6.363e-5 /25 = (0.67 *6.363e-5) /25.

0.67 *6.363e-5 = 4.264e-5.

4.264e-5 /25 = 1.7056e-6 ohm·m → 1.7056e-4 ohm·cm.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the resistivity is given per unit length, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I should look for an alternative approach. Let me think about the options. The options are all around 1e-6 ohm·cm. So perhaps the correct answer is option E:1.7e-6 ohm·cm.

But according to my calculation, I'm getting 1.7e-4 ohm·cm, which is 100 times higher. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation by a factor of 100 somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should check the units again. Oh! Wait a second, perhaps I made a mistake in converting centimeters to meters. Let me recheck.

d =0.90 cm =0.009 meters. Correct.

r =0.45 cm =0.0045 meters. Correct.

A = π*(0.0045)^2 = π*0.00002025 ≈6.363e-5 m². Correct.

L=2500 cm=25 meters. Correct.

So R =0.67 ohms.

ρ = R A / L =0.67 *6.363e-5 /25.

So 0.67 *6.363e-5 =4.264e-5.

4.264e-5 /25 =1.7056e-6 ohm·m → 1.7056e-4 ohm·cm.

Same result. So I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps I should try using the formula in ohm·cm.

Let me try that. So, using the formula:

R = ρ (L/A), where L and A are in cm, R in ohms, and ρ in ohm·cm.

So L=2500 cm, A=0.6362 cm².

R=0.67 ohms.

So ρ = R*(A/L) =0.67 * (0.6362 /2500) ohm·cm.

Which is 0.67 *0.00025448 ≈0.0001703 ohm·cm →1.703e-4 ohm·cm.

But that's not matching any option. So perhaps the correct answer is E:1.7e-6 ohm·cm, but I'm not getting it. I think I must have missed a step or made a mistake somewhere, but I can't see where.

Wait, perhaps the given length is 2500 meters instead of cm. Let me check that. 2500 cm is 25 m, correct. If it were 2500 m, that would be 250000 cm, but that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the diameter is 0.90 meters. Let me try that.

If d=0.90 m, then r=0.45 m.

A=π*(0.45)^2= π*0.2025≈0.6362 m².

L=2500 cm=25 m.

R=0.67 ohms.

So ρ = R*A/L =0.67 *0.6362 /25 →0.4264 /25=0.017 ohm·m →1.7 ohm·cm. That's way off the options.

So that can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps the given resistance is 0.67 mΩ (milli-ohms), not ohms. But the problem states 0.67 ohms.

Hmm. I'm stuck. I think I'll have to go with the calculation I did, even though it doesn't match the known resistivity. According to my calculations, the resistivity comes out to be approximately 1.7e-4 ohm·cm, which isn't one of the options. But looking at the options, the closest is option E:1.7e-6 ohm·cm. But I'm off by a factor of 100.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the area calculation. Let me recalculate the area using the diameter in centimeters.

d=0.90 cm.

A=(π d²)/4 = π*(0.90)^2 /4 = π*0.81/4=0.6362 cm². Correct.

So A/L =0.6362/2500=0.00025448 cm⁻¹.

R=0.67 ohms.

ρ=0.67 *0.00025448=0.0001703 ohm·cm.

Same as before. So I think the correct answer based on the calculation is approximately 1.7e-4 ohm·cm, but that's not an option. So perhaps the intended answer is E:1.7e-6 ohm·cm, assuming I made a mistake in the calculation by a factor of 100 somewhere. But I can't see where.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the resistivity in ohm·m, so 1.7e-6 ohm·m is option E in ohm·cm terms. Wait, no, option E is 1.7e-6 ohm·cm, which is 1.7e-8 ohm·m. But the calculation gives 1.7e-6 ohm·m, which is option E if considering ohm·cm.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the options again. The options are:

A:1.9e-6

B:2.0e-6

C:2.8e-6

D:2.2e-6

E:1.7e-6

F:1.2e-6

G:1.5e-6

H:2.5e-6

I:1.3e-6

J:1.0e-6

So according to my calculation, the resistivity is approximately 1.7e-6 ohm·m, which is 1.7e-4 ohm·cm. But none of the options match that. So perhaps the correct answer is option E:1.7e-6 ohm·cm, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation and the correct answer is option E.

Given the time I've spent and not finding the mistake, I'll go with option E.

To determine the resistivity of copper at 20°C, we use the formula for resistance:

\[
R = \rho \cdot \frac{L}{A}
\]

where \( R \) is resistance, \( \rho \) is resistivity, \( L \) is length, and \( A \) is the cross-sectional area. Rearranging for \( \rho \):

\[
\rho = R \cdot \frac{A}{L}
\]

### Given Data:
- \( R = 0.67 \, \Omega \)
- \( L = 2500 \, \text{cm} = 25 \, \text{m} \)
- Diameter \( d = 0.90 \, \text{cm} \), so radius \( r = 0.45 \, \text{cm} = 0.0045 \, \text{m} \)

### Step 1: Calculate the cross-sectional area \( A \)
The area of the wire is given by:

\[
A = \pi r^2
\]

Substituting \( r = 0.0045 \, \text{m} \):

\[
A = \pi (0.0045)^2 = \pi (0.00002025) \approx 6.363 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{m}^2
\]

### Step 2: Calculate resistivity \( \rho \)
Using the formula:

\[
\rho = R \cdot \frac{A}{L}
\]

Substitute \( R = 0.67 \, \Omega \), \( A = 6.363 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{m}^2 \), and \( L = 25 \, \text{m} \):

\[
\rho = 0.67 \cdot \frac{6.363 \times 10^{-5}}{25}
\]

First, calculate \( \frac{6.363 \times 10^{-5}}{25} \):

\[
\frac{6.363 \times 10^{-5}}{25} = 2.5452 \times 10^{-6}
\]

Now, multiply by \( R \):

\[
\rho = 0.67 \cdot 2.5452 \times 10^{-6} \approx 1.703 \times 10^{-6} \, \Omega \cdot \text{m}
\]

### Step 3: Convert to ohm-cm
Since \( 1 \, \Omega \cdot \text{m} = 100 \, \Omega \cdot \text{cm} \):

\[
\rho = 1.703 \times 10^{-6} \, \Omega \cdot \text{m} \times 100 = 1.703 \times 10^{-4} \, \Omega \cdot \text{cm}
\]

### Step 4: Compare with options
The calculated resistivity is \( 1.703 \times 10^{-4} \, \Omega \cdot \text{cm} \), which is 100 times larger than the known resistivity of copper at 20°C (\( 1.7 \times 10^{-6} \, \Omega \cdot \text{cm} \)). This discrepancy suggests a possible error in the problem setup or interpretation. However, based on the options provided and the closest match to the expected value, the correct answer is:

**E: \( 1.7 \times 10^{-6} \, \Omega \cdot \text{cm} \)**

ANSWER: E
