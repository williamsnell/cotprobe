Okay, let's try to solve this problem step by step. The question is asking for the value of a specific integral involving trigonometric functions. Hmm, the integral is from 0 to infinity of [sin²(t)/t²] multiplied by cos(2xt) dt, and then we multiply that by 2/pi. 

First, I need to figure out what this integral evaluates to. I remember that integrals involving sin²(t) and cos(2xt) might relate to some standard integrals or perhaps use integration techniques like integration by parts or maybe even using Fourier transforms. 

Wait, the function inside the integral is [sin²(t)/t²] * cos(2xt). Let me rewrite sin²(t) using a trigonometric identity. I know that sin²(t) = (1 - cos(2t))/2. So substituting that in, the integral becomes:

(2/pi) * ∫₀^∞ [ (1 - cos(2t))/ (2t²) ] * cos(2xt) dt.

Simplifying that, the 2 in the numerator and the 2 in the denominator cancel out, so we get:

(1/pi) * ∫₀^∞ [ (1 - cos(2t)) / t² ] * cos(2xt) dt.

Hmm, maybe we can split this into two separate integrals:

(1/pi) [ ∫₀^∞ cos(2xt)/t² dt - ∫₀^∞ cos(2t) cos(2xt)/t² dt ].

Now, I'm wondering if these integrals have known forms. I recall that integrals of the form ∫₀^∞ cos(at)/t² dt might involve the sine integral function, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps integrating by parts could help.

Let me consider the first integral: ∫₀^∞ cos(2xt)/t² dt. Let me set u = cos(2xt) and dv = dt/t². Then du = -2x sin(2xt) dt, and v = -1/t. So integrating by parts:

uv| from 0 to ∞ - ∫ v du.

This would be [ -cos(2xt)/t ] from 0 to ∞ plus 2x ∫ sin(2xt)/t dt.

Wait, evaluating the boundary term. As t approaches infinity, cos(2xt)/t tends to 0 because 1/t goes to 0. At t=0, cos(0)=1, so the term becomes [ -1/0 ] which is problematic. Hmm, maybe this approach isn't the best.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the integral ∫₀^∞ cos(kt)/t² dt. I think I've seen that before. Let me check if I can find a standard integral formula. 

I recall that ∫₀^∞ cos(kt)/t² dt can be expressed in terms of the sine integral function, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe using the Laplace transform or Fourier transform properties.

Wait, another approach: the integral ∫₀^∞ cos(kt)/t² dt might be related to the integral of sin(kt)/t, which is known. Because ∫₀^∞ sin(kt)/t dt = π/2 for k>0. But how does that relate to our integral?

Wait, let me consider integrating ∫ cos(kt)/t² dt. Let me make a substitution: let u = kt, so du = k dt, t = u/k, dt = du/k. Then the integral becomes ∫₀^∞ cos(u)/(u²/k²) * (du/k) ) = k ∫₀^∞ cos(u) / u² * (du/k) ) = ∫₀^∞ cos(u)/u² du. Hmm, that's the same as the original integral scaled by k. Not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps taking the Laplace transform approach. The Laplace transform of cos(kt) is s/(s² + k²), but I'm not sure how that helps here.

Wait, perhaps instead of integrating directly, I can use the differentiation under the integral sign technique. Let me think.

Let me denote I(k) = ∫₀^∞ cos(kt)/t² dt. Then, perhaps taking the derivative of I(k) with respect to k would bring down a -sin(kt) and a factor of t, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, let me consider integrating by parts again. Let me set u = 1/t², dv = cos(kt) dt. Then du = -2/t³ dt, and v = sin(kt)/k. So integrating by parts:

I(k) = uv|₀^∞ - ∫₀^∞ v du
= [ (1/t²)(sin(kt)/k) ] from 0 to ∞ - ∫₀^∞ (sin(kt)/k)(-2/t³) dt.

Evaluating the boundary term: as t→∞, sin(kt)/t² → 0. As t→0, sin(kt) ~ kt, so [kt/(k t²)] = 1/t, which tends to infinity. Hmm, that's not good. So maybe this approach is not working.

Wait, perhaps I can consider the integral ∫₀^∞ cos(kt)/t² dt as the imaginary part of some complex integral, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe I should look for a table of integrals or recall that ∫₀^∞ cos(kt)/t² dt is equal to -k π/2 for some cases. Wait, I'm not certain about that. Let me think differently.

Wait, maybe I can express 1/t² as an integral. For example, 1/t² = ∫₀^∞ s e^{-st} ds. But that might complicate things more.

Alternatively, perhaps considering the Fourier transform. The function 1/t² is not a tempered distribution, so maybe that's not the way to go.

Hmm, maybe I should try evaluating the integral numerically, but since this is a multiple-choice question, perhaps there's a smarter way.

Wait, let me consider that the integral might be expressed in terms of known functions or perhaps using integration in the complex plane. But I'm not confident about that.

Alternatively, perhaps I can recall that ∫₀^∞ (1 - cos(at))/t² dt = π a / 2. That's a standard integral. Let me check that. Yes, I think that's correct.

So, ∫₀^∞ (1 - cos(at))/t² dt = π a / 2.

In our problem, the integral is (1/pi) [ ∫₀^∞ cos(2xt)/t² dt - ∫₀^∞ cos(2t) cos(2xt)/t² dt ].

Wait, maybe I can express the second integral using a product-to-sum identity. Because cos A cos B = [cos(A+B) + cos(A-B)] / 2.

So, cos(2t) cos(2xt) = [cos(2t + 2xt) + cos(2t - 2xt)] / 2 = [cos(2t(1 + x)) + cos(2t(1 - x))] / 2.

So the second integral becomes:

∫₀^∞ [cos(2t(1 + x)) + cos(2t(1 - x))]/(2 t²) dt.

So putting it all together, the original expression becomes:

(1/pi) [ ∫₀^∞ cos(2xt)/t² dt - (1/2) ∫₀^∞ [cos(2t(1 + x)) + cos(2t(1 - x))]/t² dt ].

Let me factor out the 1/2:

(1/pi) [ ∫₀^∞ cos(2xt)/t² dt - (1/2)( ∫₀^∞ cos(2t(1 + x))/t² dt + ∫₀^∞ cos(2t(1 - x))/t² dt ) ].

Now, I can denote each integral as I(k), where I(k) = ∫₀^∞ cos(kt)/t² dt.

But earlier, I thought that ∫₀^∞ (1 - cos(kt))/t² dt = π k / 2. Therefore, ∫₀^∞ cos(kt)/t² dt = ∫₀^∞ 1/t² dt - ∫₀^∞ (1 - cos(kt))/t² dt. But ∫₀^∞ 1/t² dt is divergent, so that approach isn't helpful.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check again. The standard integral is ∫₀^∞ (1 - cos(kt))/t² dt = π k / 2. So that's correct. Therefore, ∫₀^∞ cos(kt)/t² dt = ∫₀^∞ 1/t² dt - π k / 2. But ∫ 1/t² dt from 0 to ∞ is divergent, so this suggests that ∫ cos(kt)/t² dt is also divergent. Hmm, that complicates things.

Wait, maybe I should consider that the integral ∫₀^∞ cos(kt)/t² dt is actually conditionally convergent. Maybe using the Cauchy principal value or some regularization.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the result that ∫₀^∞ cos(kt)/t² dt = - (π k)/2. Wait, that might make sense because when you subtract the standard integral, which is π k/2, from ∫ 1/t² dt, which is divergent, but perhaps in some regularized sense, it's -π k/2.

Wait, let me think again. The standard result is ∫₀^∞ (1 - cos(kt))/t² dt = π k / 2. So, rearranging, ∫₀^∞ cos(kt)/t² dt = ∫₀^∞ 1/t² dt - π k / 2. But since ∫ 1/t² dt from 0 to ∞ is divergent (it's ∫ t^{-2} dt from 0 to ∞), this suggests that ∫ cos(kt)/t² dt is also divergent. Hmm, that's a problem.

Wait, perhaps I'm approaching this incorrectly. Maybe I should look for another way to express the original integral.

Wait, let's go back to the original integral:

(2/pi) ∫₀^∞ [sin²(t)/t²] cos(2xt) dt.

Another approach: Maybe using the identity sin²(t) = (1 - cos(2t))/2, as I did before, and then express the product of cosines as a sum.

Wait, perhaps I can use the identity for the product of cosines. So, sin²(t) cos(2xt) = [ (1 - cos(2t)) / 2 ] cos(2xt).

Expanding that, we get [cos(2xt) - cos(2t) cos(2xt)] / 2.

So the integral becomes:

(2/pi) * ∫₀^∞ [cos(2xt) - cos(2t) cos(2xt)] / (2 t²) dt

Simplifying the constants:

(2/pi) * (1/2) ∫₀^∞ [cos(2xt) - cos(2t) cos(2xt)] / t² dt

Which simplifies to:

(1/pi) ∫₀^∞ [cos(2xt) - cos(2t) cos(2xt)] / t² dt.

Now, as before, we can split this into two integrals:

(1/pi) [ ∫₀^∞ cos(2xt)/t² dt - ∫₀^∞ cos(2t) cos(2xt)/t² dt ].

Again, the second integral can be expressed using the product-to-sum formula:

cos(2t) cos(2xt) = [cos(2t(1+x)) + cos(2t(1-x))]/2.

So the integral becomes:

(1/pi) [ I(2x) - (1/2)(I(2(1+x)) + I(2(1-x))) ].

Where I(k) = ∫₀^∞ cos(kt)/t² dt.

But earlier, I ran into the problem that I(k) is divergent. However, perhaps I can express I(k) in terms of the standard integral ∫ (1 - cos(kt))/t² dt = π k / 2.

Wait, let's denote J(k) = ∫₀^∞ (1 - cos(kt))/t² dt = π k / 2.

Then, I(k) = ∫₀^∞ cos(kt)/t² dt = ∫₀^∞ 1/t² dt - J(k).

But ∫ 1/t² dt from 0 to ∞ is divergent, so I(k) is also divergent. Hmm, that suggests that perhaps this approach isn't working.

Wait, maybe I should consider that the integral ∫₀^∞ cos(kt)/t² dt is actually - (π k)/2. Because, considering that ∫ (1 - cos(kt))/t² dt = π k / 2, then ∫ cos(kt)/t² dt = ∫ 1/t² dt - π k / 2. Since ∫ 1/t² from 0 to ∞ is divergent, perhaps in some regularized sense, the integral I(k) = - π k / 2.

Wait, perhaps that's the case. Let me assume that I(k) = - π k / 2.

So then, applying this to each integral:

I(2x) = - π (2x) / 2 = - π x.

Similarly, I(2(1+x)) = - π (2(1+x))/2 = - π (1 + x).

And I(2(1 - x)) = - π (2(1 - x))/2 = - π (1 - x).

So plugging these into the expression:

(1/pi) [ (-π x) - (1/2)( - π (1 + x) - π (1 - x) ) ].

Let's compute the terms inside:

= (1/pi) [ -π x - (1/2)( - π (1 + x + 1 - x) ) ]

Simplify inside the brackets:

= (1/pi) [ -π x - (1/2)( - π (2) ) ]

Because 1 + x + 1 - x = 2.

So:

= (1/pi) [ -π x - (1/2)( - 2 π ) ]

= (1/pi) [ -π x + π ]

Factor out π:

= (1/pi) * π ( -x + 1 )

= (1/pi) * π (1 - x )

= 1 - x.

So the value of the integral is 1 - x.

Given that x = sqrt(17)/17, let's compute 1 - x.

sqrt(17) is approximately 4.1231, so x ≈ 4.1231 / 17 ≈ 0.2425.

Thus, 1 - x ≈ 1 - 0.2425 = 0.7575.

Rounding to the hundredths place, that's 0.7575 ≈ 0.758, which rounds to 0.76. Wait, but looking at the options, H is 0.757, which is very close.

Wait, perhaps I made a calculation error. Let me recalculate x more precisely.

sqrt(17) is exactly 4.123105625617661 approximately.

So x = sqrt(17)/17 = 4.123105625617661 / 17 ≈ 0.242535625036333.

Thus, 1 - x ≈ 1 - 0.242535625036333 ≈ 0.757464374963667.

Rounded to the hundredths place is 0.7575, which is 0.7575, so 0.7575 ≈ 0.76 when rounded to two decimal places. Wait, but the options include H as 0.757, which is 0.757, very close to 0.7575. So the correct answer would be H: 0.757.

Wait, but let me double-check the steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. The key step was assuming that I(k) = ∫₀^∞ cos(kt)/t² dt = -π k / 2. I think that's the critical assumption. If that's correct, then the rest follows.

Yes, because if J(k) = ∫ (1 - cos(kt))/t² dt = π k / 2, then I(k) = ∫ cos(kt)/t² dt = ∫ 1/t² dt - J(k). But ∫ 1/t² dt is divergent, so perhaps in the sense of distributions or in some principal value, I(k) = - π k / 2.

Assuming that's correct, then the result is 1 - x, which with x ≈ 0.2425356 gives 1 - x ≈ 0.757464, which rounds to 0.7575, matching option H: 0.757.
</think>

The integral evaluates to \(1 - x\), where \(x = \sqrt{17}/17 \approx 0.2425\). Thus, \(1 - x \approx 0.7575\), which rounds to 0.757.
