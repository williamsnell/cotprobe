Okay, so I've got this biology question here, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let me start by reading the question carefully. The question is asking which ability is a characteristic of all living organisms. The options are labeled from A to J, and I need to pick the correct one.

Hmm, I remember that all living things share certain characteristics, often referred to as the hallmarks of life. These include things like the ability to respond to stimuli, reproduce, grow and develop, maintain homeostasis, and more. So I should go through each option and see which one fits all living organisms.

Option A says "Breathe oxygen for survival." Wait, not all organisms breathe oxygen. For example, plants don't breathe oxygen; they release it through photosynthesis. Also, some bacteria live in environments without oxygen, so they don't rely on it. So A is probably not the right answer.

Option B: "Exchange gases with the environment." That sounds more general. All living things need to exchange gases, like taking in oxygen and releasing carbon dioxide. Even anaerobic organisms exchange gases, maybe not oxygen, but they still exchange other gases. So this could be a possibility.

Option C: "Exist without water." No, all living organisms require water to survive. Without water, cells can't function, so this isn't correct.

Option D: "Detect and respond to changes in the environment." That's the definition of a response to stimuli. All living organisms can sense their environment and react, like plants growing towards light or animals fleeing danger. So this seems like a strong candidate.

Option E: "Produce heat to maintain a constant internal temperature." Only warm-blooded animals (endotherms) do this. Plants and most invertebrates don't maintain a constant body temperature, so E is out.

Option F: "Produce sugars by photosynthesis." Only plants and some other organisms like algae and some bacteria do photosynthesis. Animals can't do this, so F is incorrect.

Option G: "Move from place to place." Not all organisms can move. Plants, for example, don't move from place to place; they stay rooted. So G isn't correct for all.

Option H: "Absorb sunlight for energy." That's again specific to organisms that photosynthesize, like plants. Many animals get energy from food, not sunlight, so H is not a universal characteristic.

Option I: "Regenerate lost body parts." Not all living things can do this. Humans can't regenerate limbs, and many animals can't either. So I is out.

Option J: "Change color for camouflage." While many animals do this, it's not a characteristic of all living organisms. Plants don't change color for camouflage, for example. So J isn't the right choice.

So narrowing it down, the correct answer must be either B or D. Let me think again. B is about exchanging gases, which includes oxygen and carbon dioxide, but also other gases depending on the organism. D is about detecting and responding to changes, which is a more fundamental characteristic.

Wait, but do all living organisms detect and respond? Even bacteria can respond to changes, like moving towards nutrients (chemotaxis) or away from harmful substances. So D seems to be a universal trait.

Wait, but what about viruses? Oh, viruses aren't considered living organisms in the traditional sense because they don't meet all the criteria, like reproducing on their own. So the question is about living organisms, so I don't need to consider viruses here.

So between B and D, which is more fundamental. Exchange of gases is more about respiration, but not all organisms breathe the same way. Some might use other methods, but they do exchange gases. Detection and response is more about the ability to interact with the environment, which is essential for survival.

I think both B and D are characteristics, but the question is which is a characteristic of all. Let me think about the options again. The question is phrased as "the ability to do which of the following is a characteristic," so it's about what all living things can do.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I remember that all living things do respond to stimuli, so D is correct. But exchange of gases is also something they do, but maybe not all. Wait, wait, do all organisms exchange gases? For example, some organisms might get their energy through processes that don't involve gas exchange, but I think that's not the case. Even anaerobic respiration involves gas exchange, like releasing CO2. Or maybe not? Wait, no, anaerobic respiration doesn't require oxygen, but still, they produce CO2 as a byproduct. So they need to exchange gases, albeit not using oxygen. So B might be correct.

Wait, but what about organisms that live in environments without oxygen, like some deep-sea organisms or anaerobic bacteria? Do they exchange gases? I think they still release CO2, so they do exchange gases, even if they don't take in O2. So B might be correct.

But then, do all organisms exchange gases? Yes, because they all need to get rid of waste gases like CO2, even if they don't take in O2. So B could be the answer.

But I'm also considering that D is a key characteristic as well. So which one is the correct answer?

Wait, let me think about the options again. The question is about what is a characteristic of all living organisms. So which option is a universal trait.

Option D: Detect and respond to changes in the environment. This is a fundamental characteristic. Even the simplest organisms, like bacteria, can respond to stimuli. For example, E. coli moves towards nutrients and away from harmful substances. So D is definitely a correct characteristic.

Option B is also correct because all organisms need to exchange gases, but perhaps it's more about the process of respiration. However, some organisms might not use oxygen, but they still exchange gases. So both B and D are correct in a way, but the question is asking for the ability that is a characteristic of all living organisms.

Wait, but the question is phrased as "the ability to do which of the following is a characteristic." So perhaps D is the better answer because it's a broader ability that applies to all, including those that don't exchange gases in the traditional sense, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe both B and D are correct, but looking back at the options, the correct answer is D. Because all living organisms can detect and respond to changes, which is a universal trait, whereas gas exchange might vary in the specifics but is still a form of exchange.

Wait, but I'm a bit stuck. Let me think of examples. Do all organisms exchange gases? Yes, because they need to get rid of CO2 and possibly take in other gases, depending on their environment. But the process might be different. For example, plants use stomata, animals use lungs or gills, etc. So B is correct.

But then, is there any organism that doesn't exchange gases? I don't think so. Even single-celled organisms exchange gases through their cell membrane.

So, both B and D seem correct, but perhaps the intended answer is D. Because the question is about the ability, and detection/responding is a more active process, whereas gas exchange is more about the passive process.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should look up what the actual characteristics are. The main characteristics are:

1. Cells (or cell-like structures)
2. Metabolism
3. Homeostasis
4. Growth and development
5. Reproduction
6. Heredity
7. Response to stimuli (irritability)
8. Movement (motility)

Wait, so response to stimuli is a characteristic. So D is correct.

But gas exchange is part of metabolism, which is another characteristic. So both B and D are correct in their own ways, but the question is asking which is a characteristic.

Wait, but the options are phrased as abilities. So D is about the ability to detect and respond, which is a characteristic, whereas B is more about a process (gas exchange). So perhaps the correct answer is D.

Alternatively, the question may consider that all organisms exchange gases, so B is correct.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The question is which ability is a characteristic of all living organisms. So, the ability to detect and respond is a characteristic, as is the ability to exchange gases.

But looking at the options, the correct answer is D: Detect and respond to changes in the environment. Because that's a fundamental trait that all living things have. Even the simplest life forms can respond to their environment.

So I think the answer is D.
</think>

The ability to detect and respond to changes in the environment is a characteristic of all living organisms. This ability, known as irritability, is fundamental for survival, as it allows organisms to interact with and adapt to their surroundings. While exchanging gases (option B) is also a universal process, it is more specific to metabolic functions and not as broad a characteristic as the ability to detect and respond to stimuli. Therefore, the correct answer is:

D
