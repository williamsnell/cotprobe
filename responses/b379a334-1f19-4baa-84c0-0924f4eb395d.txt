Okay, so I've got this probability problem here about tossing two dice and finding the probability that the sum is either 6 or 7. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that when dealing with two dice, each die has 6 faces, so the total number of possible outcomes is 6 multiplied by 6, which is 36. That's the denominator in my probability calculation because it's the total number of possible outcomes.

Now, I need to find the number of favorable outcomes where the sum is 6 or 7. So I'll break this down into two parts: sums of 6 and sums of 7.

Starting with the sum of 6. What are all the possible pairs of numbers on two dice that add up to 6? Let me list them out:

- 1 and 5 (1+5=6)
- 2 and 4 (2+4=6)
- 3 and 3 (3+3=6)
- 4 and 2 (4+2=6)
- 5 and 1 (5+1=6)

Wait, but when rolling two dice, the order matters because a 1 on the first die and 5 on the second is different from 5 on the first and 1 on the second. So each of these pairs is unique, except for 3 and 3, which is the same both ways. So how many combinations do I have here?

Looking at the pairs:

1. (1,5)
2. (2,4)
3. (3,3)
4. (4,2)
5. (5,1)

So that's 5 different outcomes where the sum is 6.

Next, let's find the number of outcomes where the sum is 7. Again, I'll list them:

- 1 and 6 (1+6=7)
- 2 and 5 (2+5=7)
- 3 and 4 (3+4=7)
- 4 and 3 (4+3=7)
- 5 and 2 (5+2=7)
- 6 and 1 (6+1=7)

So how many pairs is that? Let me count:

1. (1,6)
2. (2,5)
3. (3,4)
4. (4,3)
5. (5,2)
6. (6,1)

That's 6 outcomes where the sum is 7.

Now, to find the total number of favorable outcomes for either a sum of 6 or 7, I add the two together. So 5 (for sum=6) plus 6 (for sum=7) equals 11 favorable outcomes.

So the probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. That would be 11 divided by 36, so 11/36.

Let me double-check my math to make sure I didn't miss any outcomes. For sum 6: 5 outcomes. Sum 7: 6 outcomes. 5+6=11. Total possible is 36. Yep, that seems right.

Looking at the options provided, option J is 11/36. So the correct answer should be J.

The probability is calculated by finding the number of favorable outcomes for sums of 6 or 7 and dividing by the total possible outcomes when two dice are tossed. There are 11 favorable outcomes, leading to a probability of 11/36.

Answer: J
