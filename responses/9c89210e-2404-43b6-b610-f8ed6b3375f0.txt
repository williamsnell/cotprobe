Okay, so I need to figure out which type of firm the question is referring to. The question says the firm contracts with clients to do a complete marketing research project, covering data collection, analysis, and reporting. And the options are various types of firms. 

Hmm, let me break this down. The firm is involved in all three parts: data collection, analysis, and reporting. That sounds like they're a comprehensive provider. Looking at the options, let's go through them one by one.

Option A: Data collection firm. That's about collecting data, but the firm is doing more than just thatâ€”analyzing and reporting. So maybe not this.

Option B: Freelance agency. Freelance agencies typically do projects for clients on a per-project basis, but they might have different focuses. It depends if they're part of a larger agency or a standalone service. Not sure yet.

Option C: Data analysis firm. This is about analyzing data, but the firm also does the collection and reporting, which data analysis isn't the main job of.

Option D: Survey firm. They do surveys, but again, the question says they do data collection, analysis, and reporting, which are more involved than just conducting surveys.

Option E: Full-service agency. This suggests they handle all aspects, including marketing. This fits because marketing research is a big area, and a full-service agency likely covers all those functions.

Option F: Tabulation agency. That's about compiling data, which is a part of the reporting, but the main focus is on marketing research, so maybe not the best fit.

Option G: Marketing agency. That's more specific to marketing and might not cover all the research aspects the question mentions.

Option H: Research firm. This seems like a good fit because it's a firm that does research, which includes data collection, analysis, and reporting.

Option I: Consultant. Consultants provide guidance, not necessarily a complete project. It might be more for helping rather than doing the project itself.

Option J: Field agency. That's more about field studies, like in the field, not necessarily a comprehensive marketing research firm.

So, between E and H. The question says it's a complete project. A full-service agency (E) would likely handle all those aspects, whereas a research firm (H) is more about conducting the research. But I'm a bit torn. Full-service agencies do more than research; they often provide marketing services as well, so maybe E is better.

Wait, but the question says it's a marketing research firm, so perhaps they're more aligned with a marketing agency. Alternatively, a full-service agency might be better because they handle marketing aspects as part of their services.

Alternatively, I think the best fit is E: Full-service agency because they're a comprehensive service provider covering all marketing research and marketing aspects. Or H: Research firm, but maybe they're more focused on marketing research than full marketing services.

Hmm, maybe I should consider that a full-service agency includes marketing services. So the correct answer might be E.

The correct answer is E: Full-service agency. This firm provides a comprehensive service, including data collection, analysis, reporting, and marketing services, fitting the description of a complete marketing research project. 

Answer: E
