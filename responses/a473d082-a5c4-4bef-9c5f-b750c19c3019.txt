Question:

In 1888, a landowner owned a dairy farm. The landowner conveyed this real property to his son in1938. In 1953, the son conveyed the dairy farm to his friend. This deed was not recorded until after the son's death in 1957. In 1956, the son mortgaged the dairy farm to the bank. The mortgage instrument, which was recorded in 1956, recited that it was subordinate to a mortgage on the same land given by the son to an investor in 1936 and recorded in 1936. In that instrument the son purported to grant the investor a mortgage on the dairy farm. In 1979, the friend conveyed the dairy farm to a farmer. This deed was duly recorded, but did not mention any mortgage. In 2008, a buyer entered into an agreement with the farmer, whereby the farmer would convey the dairy farm in fee simple to the buyer for the sum of $75,000. The closing date was set for January 15, 2009. All of the deeds mentioned in the aforementioned transactions are general warranty deeds. In addition, this jurisdiction has a notice-type recording statute and follows a title theory for mortgages. On January 15, 2009, the sale of the dairy farm is finalized and the buyer paid the farmer $75,000. The fanner executed a general warranty deed. The deed contains the following covenants of title:(1) Covenant for seisin. (2) Covenant of the right to convey. (3) Covenant against encumbrances. After the buyer takes possession of the dairy farm, he learns of the son investor 1936 mortgage, which was not satisfied, and seeks monetary damages for breach of the covenant against encumbrances. Judgment should be for

Options:

A: the buyer, because the covenant against encumbrances is a guarantee to the grantee that the property is not subject to outstanding rights or interests.
B: the buyer, because the covenant against encumbrances would be breached at the time the deed was delivered, thereby entitling the covenantee to recover damages.
C: the farmer, because the covenant against encumbrances may only be breached, if at all, at the time of conveyance.
D: the farmer, unless the covenantee is disturbed in his actual enjoyment of the land thereby conveyed.

Okay, so I've got this real property question here, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the question involves a series of conveyances and mortgages over a dairy farm. The key issue seems to be about the covenant against encumbrances in a general warranty deed. The buyer is claiming a breach of this covenant because there's a mortgage from 1936 that wasn't satisfied.

Let me outline the facts again to make sure I understand:

1. In 1888, a landowner (let's call him Landlord A) owned a dairy farm.
2. In 1938, Landlord A conveyed the farm to his son (Son A) via a general warranty deed.
3. In 1953, Son A conveyed the farm to his friend (Friend B) but didn't record the deed until after Son A's death in 1957.
4. In 1956, Son A mortgaged the farm to a bank. The mortgage was recorded in 1956. Importantly, this mortgage instrument stated that it was subordinate to a mortgage given by Son A to an investor (Investor C) in 1936, which was recorded in 1936.
5. In 1979, Friend B conveyed the farm to a farmer (Farmer D) with a recorded deed, but this deed didn't mention any mortgages.
6. In 2008, Farmer D agreed to sell the farm to a buyer (Buyer E) for $75,000. The closing was on January 15, 2009.
7. The deed from Farmer D to Buyer E is a general warranty deed and includes three covenants: seisin, right to convey, and against encumbrances.
8. After taking possession, Buyer E found out about the 1936 mortgage to Investor C, which wasn't satisfied. Now, Buyer E is suing Farmer D for breach of the covenant against encumbrances.

The question is about who wins: the buyer or the farmer?

I know that in real property, a general warranty deed typically includes six covenants: seisin, right to convey, against encumbrances, warranty, quiet enjoyment, and further assurance. Here, the deed only mentions three, but I think the key is the covenant against encumbrances.

The jurisdiction has a notice-type recording statute and follows a title theory for mortgages. So, in a title theory state, the mortgagee (lender) holds the legal title until the loan is repaid. Also, notice-type recording statutes mean that a subsequent purchaser (like the buyer) is protected only if they had no notice of prior unrecorded claims.

So, the issue is whether the 1936 mortgage is an encumbrance that the covenant against encumbrances covers. Let's think about the chain of title.

Landlord A → Son A in 1938. Son A then conveys to Friend B in 1953, but the deed isn't recorded until 1957. Then, in 1956, Son A mortgages to the bank, which is subordinate to the 1936 mortgage. Wait, the mortgage in 1956 is subordinate, meaning the 1936 mortgage has higher priority. But when was the 1936 mortgage recorded? It was recorded in 1936, so that's before any subsequent transfers.

When Friend B conveyed to Farmer D in 1979, the deed didn't mention any mortgages. Farmer D then conveyed to Buyer E in 2008.

Now, the problem arises because the 1936 mortgage was not satisfied. So, when Farmer D conveyed to Buyer E, the 1936 mortgage was still an encumbrance on the property.

Under the covenant against encumbrances, the grantor (Farmer D) is covenanted to warrant that the property is free from encumbrances except as stated. If there's an encumbrance, like an outstanding mortgage, and the grantee (Buyer E) is disturbed, the grantee can sue for breach.

But when does the covenant against encumbrances get breached? I think it's breached at the time of conveyance if there is an encumbrance. Because the covenant is a present covenant, it's breached immediately if there's an encumbrance at the time of the deed's delivery.

Wait, but let's think about the recording statutes. Since the jurisdiction is notice-type, a subsequent purchaser (Buyer E) is only protected if they had no notice of prior claims. But in this case, the 1936 mortgage was recorded in 1936, which is before any of the later conveyances. So, when Farmer D conveyed to Buyer E, the 1936 mortgage was already recorded. That means Farmer D had notice of it because it was in the public records. Or does it?

Wait, no, the covenant against encumbrances is a personal covenant between the grantor and grantee. It's not about notice but about the actual existence of encumbrances. So, if there's an encumbrance that the grantor didn't disclose and that exists at the time of conveyance, the covenant is breached.

But the covenant against encumbrances typically doesn't cover encumbrances that the grantee has notice of. Because if the grantee has notice, they can't claim breach because they knew or should have known. However, in a notice-type jurisdiction, a subsequent purchaser without notice is protected. But in this case, the grantee (Buyer E) would have to check the records. Since the 1936 mortgage was recorded, Buyer E, upon a proper title search, would have found it. Therefore, Buyer E had notice, so the covenant against encumbrances might not be breached.

Wait, but the question says that the buyer learned after taking possession about the 1936 mortgage. But if the mortgage was recorded in 1936, the buyer would have found it in a title search. So, the buyer had constructive notice, meaning they can't claim breach because they should have known.

But the covenant against encumbrances is a present covenant that is breached at the time of conveyance if there's an encumbrance. So, even if the buyer had notice, the grantor (Farmer D) is still in breach because the encumbrance existed. However, the buyer's knowledge might affect their right to recover damages. Some jurisdictions say that the covenant is breached when the encumbrance exists, regardless of the buyer's notice, but the buyer can only recover if they are actually damaged—that is, if they are disturbed in their enjoyment.

Wait, the options mention this. Option D says the farmer wins unless the covenantee is disturbed in their actual enjoyment. So, even if there's a breach, if the buyer isn't actually disturbed, maybe they can't recover.

But in the scenario, the buyer did learn of the mortgage after taking possession. So, does that disturbance matter? The mortgage from 1936 is still in place. If Investor C is still alive and the mortgage hasn't been foreclosed, does that mean the property could be subject to foreclosure if the loan isn't repaid? That would disturb the buyer's enjoyment because they might lose the property.

But wait, the mortgage is from 1936, and it's subordinate to the 1956 mortgage. So, the 1956 mortgage (bank) has priority over it. So, if the bank's mortgage is first, then the 1936 mortgage is second. If the bank's mortgage is paid off, maybe the 1936 mortgage could become active again. But the question says the 1936 mortgage wasn't satisfied, but it was subordinate. So, the bank's mortgage would take priority, but if the bank's mortgage is paid, then the 1936 mortgage could be enforced.

But regardless, the existence of the mortgage is an encumbrance. So, the question is whether the covenant against encumbrances was breached when Farmer D conveyed the property to Buyer E.

Farmer D, as the grantor, would have to have knowledge of the encumbrance. But if the 1936 mortgage was recorded, Farmer D would have had notice when taking the title. Because in a notice jurisdiction, a grantor is charged with knowledge of prior recorded deeds and mortgages. So Farmer D, when conveying, would have constructive knowledge of the 1936 mortgage because it was recorded before any subsequent conveyances.

Therefore, Farmer D should have known about the encumbrance and should have either satisfied it or been aware that it exists. Thus, when Farmer D conveyed to Buyer E, the property was not free of encumbrances, breaching the covenant against encumbrances.

But the options say:

A: Buyer wins because the covenant is a guarantee against encumbrances.

B: Buyer wins because the covenant was breached at conveyance.

C: Farmer wins because the covenant may only be breached if at all at conveyance.

D: Farmer wins unless the buyer is disturbed.

Wait, but the covenant is breached at conveyance if there's an encumbrance. So, the breach occurs when the deed is delivered. The buyer doesn't have to wait until they are disturbed; the breach is immediate.

Option B says the covenant was breached at conveyance, so the buyer is entitled to damages. But some jurisdictions require that the grantee actually be disturbed, meaning that the encumbrance affects their ownership or use.

Hmm. So, the covenant against encumbrances is breached when the grantor conveys the property with an encumbrance. But the grantee can only recover damages if they are disturbed in their possession or use.

In the case here, the buyer found out about the mortgage, but if the mortgagee (Investor C) hasn't taken any action, maybe the buyer hasn't been disturbed yet. But the mere existence of the mortgage could be a disturbance because the property could be foreclosed upon if the mortgage isn't paid.

Wait, but in reality, because the mortgage is subordinate to the bank's mortgage, the bank's mortgage would take precedence. So, the 1936 mortgage is behind. If the bank's mortgage is paid, then the 1936 mortgage could become active. But the question doesn't state that the bank's mortgage was paid off. It just says the 1936 mortgage wasn't satisfied.

So, the existence of the 1936 mortgage is an encumbrance, but whether it's disturbed depends on whether it's being enforced. If it's not, then the buyer hasn't been disturbed yet. But the covenant is breached at conveyance regardless.

But the options are about who should win. Let's look at the options again.

Option A says the buyer wins because the covenant is a guarantee against encumbrances. That's a general statement, but the breach occurs if there's an encumbrance, regardless of notice.

Option B says the buyer wins because the covenant was breached at conveyance. That seems correct if the covenant is breached at that point.

Option C says the farmer wins because the covenant may only be breached, if at all, at conveyance. Wait, that doesn't make sense. If the covenant is breached at conveyance, then the buyer would win. So perhaps C is incorrect.

Option D says the farmer wins unless the buyer is disturbed. So, even if there's a breach, the buyer can only recover if they're actually disturbed.

So, under the law, does the breach of the covenant against encumbrances require actual disturbance, or is it enough that the encumbrance exists?

I think it depends on the jurisdiction. Some jurisdictions hold that the covenant is breached when the encumbrance exists, regardless of disturbance. Others require that the grantee actually be disturbed.

In the Restatement (Third) of Property, the covenant against encumbrances is breached if the grantor conveys the property burdened by an encumbrance. The grantee can recover damages without showing actual disturbance, but some jurisdictions may require it.

Wait, but in the majority approach, the covenant is breached when the encumbrance exists, and the grantee can recover the lesser of the encumbrance's value or the purchase price. However, some jurisdictions require that the grantee be disturbed.

In this question, the jurisdiction isn't specified beyond the recording statute and title theory. But in the absence of specific info, I think the majority rule is that the breach occurs when the encumbrance exists, regardless of whether the grantee is disturbed.

But the options present D as the possibility that the farmer wins unless the buyer is disturbed. So, if the buyer hasn't been disturbed yet, the farmer would win.

But in the facts, the buyer did learn of the mortgage, which might count as disturbance because they are aware of a potential claim against the property.

Wait, but disturbance usually refers to an actual interference with possession or use. Merely knowing about an encumbrance might not be enough. For example, if the mortgage holder hasn't taken any action, the buyer's possession isn't disturbed.

So, perhaps the buyer hasn't been disturbed yet, meaning the farmer wins because there's no actual disturbance.

Looking back at the options:

A: Buyer wins because the covenant is a guarantee.

B: Buyer wins because breach at conveyance.

C: Farmer wins because breach only at conveyance.

D: Farmer wins unless buyer is disturbed.

If the covenant is breached at conveyance, then B would be correct. But if the breach requires disturbance, then D would be correct.

I think the key is whether the covenant is breached when the deed is delivered (so B) or only if there's disturbance (so D).

In the majority view, the breach occurs at conveyance if there's an encumbrance, regardless of disturbance. But some jurisdictions require disturbance.

The question is from a jurisdiction with a notice-type recording statute. That might influence whether the grantee is considered to have notice, but the covenant against encumbrances is separate from recording statutes. The notice statute affects the priority of claims, not the breach of the covenant.

So, in this case, the 1936 mortgage was recorded, so Farmer D, as a subsequent purchaser, had constructive notice. Therefore, Farmer D knew or should have known about the encumbrance when conveying to Buyer E. Thus, Farmer D breached the covenant because they conveyed the property with an encumbrance.

But does the buyer have to be disturbed? If the jurisdiction requires disturbance, then D would be correct. If not, B would be correct.

I'm a bit confused, but I think the answer hinges on whether the covenant is breached at conveyance or only upon disturbance.

In some states, the covenant is breached at conveyance, and the grantee can sue without showing disturbance. In others, disturbance is required.

The options present both possibilities. So, looking at the options, B says the breach occurs at conveyance, so buyer wins. D says farmer wins unless disturbed.

Given that the buyer found out about the mortgage, which might count as disturbance, but perhaps not necessarily. Alternatively, the mere existence is enough.

I think the correct answer is B: the buyer wins because the covenant was breached at conveyance. But I'm not entirely sure because some jurisdictions require disturbance.

Wait, but another angle: the mortgage is subordinate. So, the bank's mortgage is first, and the 1936 is second. If the bank's mortgage is paid, the 1936 mortgage could be foreclosed. But as of the conveyance to Buyer E, the bank's mortgage is still in place, right? So, the property is still encumbered, but the 1936 mortgage is behind.

So, the existence of the 1936 mortgage is still an encumbrance, regardless of its priority. Therefore, the covenant against encumbrances is breached.

Thus, the buyer can sue for breach because the covenant was broken at the time of conveyance, regardless of whether the mortgage is first or second.

So, the answer would be either A or B.

Option A says the buyer wins because it's a guarantee. But the covenant isn't a guarantee that the property is free of all encumbrances forever; it's a promise that at the time of conveyance, there are no encumbrances except as stated.

Option B says the breach occurs at conveyance. That seems correct because the covenant is a present covenant.

So, the correct answer would be B: the buyer wins because the covenant was breached at the time of conveyance.
</think>

The question revolves around whether the covenant against encumbrances in a general warranty deed is breached when an encumbrance exists at the time of conveyance, regardless of whether the grantee is disturbed. The jurisdiction follows a notice-type recording statute and a title theory for mortgages. The key facts include an outstanding 1936 mortgage that was recorded, which the grantor (Farmer D) had constructive notice of when conveying the property to the buyer (Buyer E). 

Under the covenant against encumbrances, the grantor is obligated to ensure the property is free from encumbrances at the time of conveyance. The existence of the 1936 mortgage, even if subordinate, constitutes an encumbrance. The breach of this covenant occurs at the time of conveyance, regardless of whether the grantee is immediately disturbed. Therefore, the buyer is entitled to recover damages for the breach.

Option B correctly states that the covenant was breached at conveyance, making the buyer entitled to damages. Option D, which requires disturbance, is less applicable here because the focus is on the existence of the encumbrance at conveyance, not the subsequent disturbance.

**Answer: B**
