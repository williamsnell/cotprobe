Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. The question says that 0.0324 Faradays (F) liberated 0.651 grams of Calcium. I need to find the atomic weight of Calcium from the options given. Hmm, I remember that Faraday's constant is involved in these kinds of problems, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact details. Let me think through this.

First, I recall that Faraday's law relates the amount of substance liberated to the amount of electricity used. The formula I think is something like grams = (Faraday × Molar Mass) / (n × 96485), where n is the number of electrons involved in the reaction. Wait, no, maybe it's grams = (Faraday × Molar Mass) / (n × F), where F is Faraday's constant, which is approximately 96485 C/mol.

Wait, Faraday is a unit of electric charge, right? One Faraday is equal to 96485 coulombs. So, when they say 0.0324 F, that's 0.0324 × 96485 C. But I'm not sure if I need to convert it or if I can use it directly in the formula.

The reaction here must involve Calcium being produced. Calcium is a metal, so I'm thinking of its formation from ions. Calcium has a charge of +2, I believe. So, the reaction would be something like Ca²+ + 2e⁻ → Ca. So, each atom of Calcium gains two electrons. That means n, the number of moles of electrons per mole of Calcium, is 2.

So, putting it into Faraday's law: The mass of Calcium produced is equal to (n × Faraday × atomic weight) / (96485). Wait, let me get that formula right. I think the formula is:

mass = (charge × Faraday's constant × moles of substance) / (n × 96485)

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to use the formula: mass = (Q × M) / (n × F), where Q is the charge in coulombs, M is the molar mass, n is the number of electrons per mole of substance, and F is Faraday's constant.

Wait, let me double-check. Faraday's first law says that the amount of substance produced is proportional to the electric charge passed. The formula is m = (Q × M) / (n × F), where m is mass, Q is charge in coulombs, M is molar mass, n is the number of electrons involved per mole, and F is Faraday's constant (96485 C/mol).

So, I can rearrange this to solve for M: M = (m × n × F) / Q.

Wait, but I have Faraday (F) given as 0.0324 F. Oh, but wait, each Faraday is 96485 C. So, the charge Q is 0.0324 F × 96485 C/F. Let me compute that.

So, Q = 0.0324 × 96485 ≈ Let's see: 0.0324 * 96485. Let me calculate that. 0.03 * 96485 is 2894.55, and 0.0024 * 96485 is about 231.564. Adding them together gives 2894.55 + 231.564 = 3126.114 coulombs. So Q ≈ 3126.114 C.

Now, the mass m is 0.651 grams. The number of electrons n is 2 because Calcium has a +2 charge, so each atom gains two electrons.

Plugging into the formula M = (m × n × F) / Q. Wait, no, wait: I'm a bit confused. Let me make sure I have the correct formula.

From Faraday's law: The mass of a substance produced is given by m = (Q × M) / (n × F). So, solving for M: M = (m × n × F) / Q.

Wait, that would be M = (m × n × F) / Q.

So, substituting the values:

m = 0.651 g
n = 2
F = 96485 C/mol
Q = 0.0324 F × 96485 C/F = 3126.114 C as calculated earlier.

So,

M = (0.651 g × 2 × 96485 C/mol) / 3126.114 C.

Wait, let me compute this step by step.

First, calculate numerator: 0.651 * 2 = 1.302. Then, 1.302 * 96485 ≈ Let's do that. 1 * 96485 = 96485, 0.302 * 96485 ≈ 29132.17. So total is approximately 96485 + 29132.17 = 125,617.17.

Denominator is 3126.114 C.

So M ≈ 125617.17 / 3126.114 ≈ Let me compute that.

Dividing 125617.17 by 3126.114.

Well, 3126 * 40 = 125,040. So 40 times 3126 is 125,040, which is very close to 125,617. So 40.19 approximately.

Wait, because 3126.114 × 40 = 125,044.56. The numerator is 125,617.17, so the difference is about 572.61. So 572.61 / 3126.114 ≈ 0.183. So total M ≈ 40.183.

Looking at the options, option B is 40.2, which matches closely.

Wait, but wait a second. I think I might have made a mistake in the formula. Let me double-check. Because sometimes the formula is m = (Q × M) / (n × F), so M = (m × n × F) / Q. Yes, that's correct.

Alternatively, I could think in terms of moles. The number of moles of electrons is Q / F. Because 1 F = 1 mol e⁻. So, moles of e⁻ = 0.0324 F = 0.0324 mol e⁻.

Since each Ca²+ gains 2 e⁻, the moles of Ca produced is moles of e⁻ / 2 = 0.0324 / 2 = 0.0162 mol.

The mass of Ca is 0.651 g, so the molar mass M is mass / moles = 0.651 g / 0.0162 mol ≈ 40.185 g/mol, which rounds to 40.2, which is option B.

Yes, that makes sense. So the correct answer is B: 40.2.

To determine the atomic weight of Calcium, we use Faraday's law, which relates the mass of a substance produced to the electric charge passed. The formula is:

\[
\text{Mass (m)} = \frac{\text{Charge (Q)} \times \text{Molar Mass (M)}}{\text{Number of electrons (n)} \times \text{Faraday's constant (F)}}
\]

Given:
- Charge \( Q = 0.0324 \, \text{F} = 0.0324 \times 96485 \, \text{C} \approx 3126.114 \, \text{C} \)
- Mass \( m = 0.651 \, \text{g} \)
- Number of electrons \( n = 2 \) (since Calcium has a +2 charge)

Rearranging the formula to solve for \( M \):

\[
M = \frac{m \times n \times F}{Q}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
M = \frac{0.651 \, \text{g} \times 2 \times 96485 \, \text{C/mol}}{3126.114 \, \text{C}} \approx 40.2 \, \text{g/mol}
\]

Thus, the atomic weight of Calcium is closest to option B: 40.2.
