Question:

The gauge pressure in an automobile tire when measured during winter at 32°F was 30 pounds per square inch (psi). The same tire was used during the summer, and its temperature rose to 122°F. If we assume that the volume of the tire did not change, and no air leaked out between winter and summer, what is the new pressure as measured on the gauge?

Options:

A: 40.1 psig
B: 44.7 psig
C: 52.9 psig
D: 30 psig
E: 35.5 psig
F: 50.4 psig
G: 45.6 psig
H: 38.2 psig
I: 33.8 psig
J: 47.3 psig

Okay, so I've got this problem here about the pressure in a car tire changing with temperature. Hmm, I remember that when gases are heated, their pressure increases if the volume stays the same. But wait, how exactly does that work? Oh right, it's Charles's Law or Gay-Lussac's Law, something like that. I think it's the combined gas law because pressure and temperature are involved, and volume is constant.

Alright, the problem says the tire's gauge pressure in winter was 30 psi at 32°F. Then in summer, the temperature rose to 122°F, and we need to find the new gauge pressure. The volume didn't change, and no air leaked out, so the amount of gas is the same. So it's definitely a case where pressure and temperature are directly proportional when volume is constant.

Wait, but wait—temperature has to be in Kelvin, right? Oh yeah, because gas laws require absolute temperature. So I need to convert both temperatures from Fahrenheit to Kelvin. 

First, let me convert 32°F to Kelvin. The formula is K = (°F + 459.67) × 5/9. So 32 + 459.67 is 491.67. Multiply by 5/9: 491.67 * 5 = 2458.35, divided by 9 is approximately 273.15 K. Oh wait, that's 0°C in Kelvin, makes sense because water freezes at 32°F, which is 0°C.

Now for the summer temperature: 122°F. Adding 459.67 gives 581.67. Multiply by 5/9: 581.67 *5 is 2908.35, divided by 9 is about 323.15 K. Let me double-check that calculation: 581.67 *5 is 2908.35, and 2908.35 /9 is indeed around 323.15 K.

So initial pressure P1 is 30 psig, but wait, gauge pressure is pressure above atmospheric. So absolute pressure would be P1_abs = 30 psi + atmospheric pressure. But wait, the problem says gauge pressure, and we're comparing it. Wait, maybe we don't need to add atmospheric here because both measurements are gauge, but the process would involve absolute pressure. Hmm, no, when using gas laws, we need absolute pressure because P1 and P2 are absolute.

Wait, but the problem gives gauge pressure in both cases. So I need to convert both to absolute pressure before applying the formula. Because gauge pressure is relative to atmospheric, and the gas laws use absolute pressure. So initial absolute pressure P1_abs = 30 psi + atmospheric pressure. But wait, what's the atmospheric pressure? It's standard pressure, which is 14.7 psi. So P1_abs = 30 + 14.7 = 44.7 psi.

Wait, but is that correct? Because when the gas is inside the tire, the absolute pressure is the gauge pressure plus atmospheric. So yes, that makes sense. So P1_abs = 30 + 14.7 = 44.7 psi.

Now, for the summer, the volume is the same, and the amount of gas hasn't changed, so we can use the combined gas law: P1 * V1 / T1 = P2 * V2 / T2. Since V1 = V2, they cancel out, so P1 / T1 = P2 / T2. So P2 = P1 * (T2 / T1).

Wait, but wait, P1 is absolute pressure, right? So P1 is 44.7 psi, T1 is 273.15 K, T2 is 323.15 K.

So P2 = 44.7 * (323.15 / 273.15). Let me calculate that. 323.15 / 273.15 is approximately 1.183. Multiplying 44.7 by 1.183 gives roughly 52.9 psi. Wait, that's the absolute pressure in the summer. But the question asks for gauge pressure, so we need to subtract atmospheric pressure again. So P2_gauge = 52.9 - 14.7 = 38.2 psig? Wait, that doesn't match any of the options. Wait, no, looking back at the options, option H is 38.2 psig. But wait, wait a minute, maybe I made a mistake here.

Wait, let me double-check. Because if I use absolute pressure, P1_abs = 30 + 14.7 = 44.7 psi, correct. T1 is 273.15 K, T2 is 323.15 K. So P2_abs = 44.7 * (323.15 / 273.15). Let me compute that more accurately.

323.15 / 273.15 ≈ 1.1832. So 44.7 * 1.1832 = 44.7 * 1.1832.

Let me compute 44.7 * 1 = 44.7.

44.7 * 0.1832 = let's see, 44.7 * 0.1 = 4.47, 44.7 *0.08=3.576, 44.7 *0.0032≈0.143. So total ≈4.47 +3.576=8.046 +0.143≈8.189.

So total P2_abs ≈44.7 +8.189≈52.889 psi. So approximately 52.9 psi. Then the gauge pressure is 52.9 -14.7=38.2 psig. So that would be option H: 38.2 psig.

Wait, but wait another thought. Alternatively, maybe the problem treats gauge pressure as absolute, but no, that's not right. Gauge pressure is always relative. So I think my approach is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the ratio without converting to absolute pressure. Wait, but that's wrong because gas laws require absolute temperature and absolute pressure.

Wait another approach: perhaps the initial absolute pressure is 30 psi gauge, which is 30 + 14.7 =44.7 psi. Then, in summer, absolute pressure is P2 = P1 * (T2/T1) =44.7 * (323.15/273.15)≈52.9 psi. Then the gauge pressure is 52.9 -14.7=38.2 psig, which is option H.

But wait, looking back at the options, option C is 52.9 psig. So that's the absolute pressure. But the question asks for gauge, so the correct answer should be 38.2 psig, which is option H.

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake here. Let me think again. Another approach: if the volume is constant, then P1/T1 = P2/T2. But using gauge pressure directly wouldn't work because the temperature affects absolute pressure. So using absolute pressure is correct.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the initial pressure is 30 psi gauge, which is 44.7 psi absolute. Then, when temperature increases, the absolute pressure increases to 52.9 psi, so gauge is 52.9 -14.7=38.2, which is option H.

But wait, in the options, option C is 52.9, which is the absolute pressure. So maybe the problem expects the answer in absolute pressure, but the question says gauge. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in converting Fahrenheit to Kelvin.

Wait, let me recalculate the temperatures. 32°F to K: 32 + 459.67 = 491.67, then 491.67 *5/9 = (491.67 *5)=2458.35, divided by 9 is 273.15 K. Correct.

122°F: 122 +459.67=581.67. 581.67 *5/9: 581.67 *5=2908.35, divided by 9 is 323.15 K. Correct.

So the calculation seems right. So absolute pressure in summer is about 52.9 psi, so gauge is 38.2, which is option H. So the correct answer should be H: 38.2 psig.

The problem involves determining the new gauge pressure in a car tire when the temperature increases from 32°F to 122°F, assuming the volume remains constant and no air leaks out. Using the combined gas law, the relationship between pressure and temperature is given by:

\[
\frac{P_1}{T_1} = \frac{P_2}{T_2}
\]

where \(P_1\) and \(T_1\) are the initial absolute pressure and temperature, and \(P_2\) and \(T_2\) are the final absolute pressure and temperature. Since gauge pressure is relative to atmospheric pressure, the absolute pressure must first be calculated by adding the gauge pressure to the atmospheric pressure (14.7 psi).

### Step 1: Convert Temperatures to Kelvin
- Initial temperature (\(T_1\)):  
  \[
  T_1 = 32°F + 459.67 = 491.67 \, \text{°F} \times \frac{5}{9} = 273.15 \, \text{K}
  \]
- Final temperature (\(T_2\)):  
  \[
  T_2 = 122°F + 459.67 = 581.67 \, \text{°F} \times \frac{5}{9} = 323.15 \, \text{K}
  \]

### Step 2: Calculate Absolute Pressures
- Initial absolute pressure (\(P_1\)):  
  \[
  P_1 = 30 \, \text{psi (gauge)} + 14.7 \, \text{psi (atmospheric)} = 44.7 \, \text{psi (absolute)}
  \]
- Final absolute pressure (\(P_2\)):  
  Using the combined gas law:  
  \[
  P_2 = P_1 \times \frac{T_2}{T_1} = 44.7 \times \frac{323.15}{273.15} \approx 52.9 \, \text{psi (absolute)}
  \]

### Step 3: Convert Absolute Pressure to Gauge Pressure
The final gauge pressure is:  
\[
P_2 \, \text{(gauge)} = P_2 \, \text{(absolute)} - 14.7 \, \text{psi (atmospheric)} = 52.9 - 14.7 = 38.2 \, \text{psig}
\]

### Final Answer
The new gauge pressure in the tire is **38.2 psig**, corresponding to **option H**.
