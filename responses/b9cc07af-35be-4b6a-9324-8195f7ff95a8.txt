Question:

Suppose that the weights of trucks traveling on the interstate highway system are normally distributed. If 70% of the trucks weigh more than 12,000 pounds and 80% weigh more than 10,000 pounds, what are the mean and standard deviation for the weights of trucks traveling on the interstate system?

Okay, so I've got this statistics problem here, and I need to figure out the mean and standard deviation of truck weights based on the given information. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the problem says that the weights of trucks are normally distributed. That means the distribution is symmetric around the mean, and I can use properties of the normal distribution to solve this.

The key information given is:
- 70% of trucks weigh more than 12,000 pounds.
- 80% of trucks weigh more than 10,000 pounds.

I remember that in a normal distribution, certain percentages correspond to certain z-scores. The z-score tells me how many standard deviations away a value is from the mean.

Let me denote the mean as μ and the standard deviation as σ. I need to find μ and σ.

So, for the first piece of information: 70% of trucks weigh more than 12,000 pounds. That means that 30% weigh less than or equal to 12,000 pounds. In terms of the standard normal distribution, this corresponds to the 30th percentile. 

Similarly, for the second piece: 80% weigh more than 10,000, so 20% weigh less than or equal to 10,000. That's the 20th percentile.

I think I can set up two equations using z-scores for these percentiles.

For 12,000 pounds:
P(X ≤ 12,000) = 0.30
So, P(Z ≤ (12000 - μ)/σ) = 0.30

Looking up the z-score for the 30th percentile in the standard normal distribution table, I find that z ≈ -0.475. Wait, no, wait. Wait, actually, I think the 30th percentile is when 30% are below, so the z-score is negative. Let me double-check. The z-score for 0.30 is around z = -0.475, yes.

So, equation 1: (12,000 - μ)/σ = -0.475

For 10,000 pounds:
P(X ≤ 10,000) = 0.20
So, P(Z ≤ (10000 - μ)/σ) = 0.20

The z-score for 0.20 is about z = -0.8416. So equation 2: (10,000 - μ)/σ = -0.8416

Now I have two equations:

1. (12,000 - μ)/σ = -0.475
2. (10,000 - μ)/σ = -0.8416

I can rewrite these as:

1. 12,000 - μ = -0.475σ
2. 10,000 - μ = -0.8416σ

Now, I can rearrange both equations to express μ in terms of σ.

From equation 1: μ = 12,000 + 0.475σ

From equation 2: μ = 10,000 + 0.8416σ

Since both equal μ, I can set them equal to each other:

12,000 + 0.475σ = 10,000 + 0.8416σ

Subtract 10,000 from both sides:

2,000 + 0.475σ = 0.8416σ

Now, subtract 0.475σ from both sides:

2,000 = 0.8416σ - 0.475σ
2,000 = (0.8416 - 0.475)σ
Calculate 0.8416 - 0.475: that's 0.3666.

So, 2,000 = 0.3666σ

Now, solve for σ:

σ = 2,000 / 0.3666 ≈ 5,454. But wait, let me calculate that more accurately.

Let me compute 2000 divided by 0.3666.

Calculating: 0.3666 * 5454 ≈ 2000. So, σ ≈ 5,454. But looking at the options, I don't see a σ around 5,454. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the z-scores.

Wait, maybe I confused the percentiles. Let me check the z-scores again.

Wait, for P(X > 12,000) = 70%, which means P(X ≤ 12,000) = 30%. So the z-score is indeed the 30th percentile, which is negative. Similarly for 10,000, P(X ≤ 10,000)=20%, so z is negative.

Wait, let me double-check the z-scores. Maybe I used the wrong values.

Looking up in the standard normal distribution table:

For P(Z ≤ z) = 0.30, z is approximately -0.475, yes.

For P(Z ≤ z) = 0.20, z is approximately -0.8416, correct.

So, equations are correct.

So σ ≈ 5,454. Let me compute 2000 / 0.3666 exactly.

Compute 0.3666 * 5,454 = ?

0.3666 * 5,000 = 1,833.

0.3666 * 454 = let's see: 454 * 0.3666.

Compute 400*0.3666=146.64, 50*0.3666=18.33, 4*0.3666≈1.4664. Total ≈146.64+18.33=164.97 +1.4664≈166.4364.

So 1,833 + 166.4364 ≈ 1,999.4364. Close enough to 2,000.

So σ ≈5,454.

Now, using equation 1: μ = 12,000 + 0.475 * 5,454

Calculate 0.475 *5,454.

First, 5,000 *0.475=2,375.

454*0.475: Let's compute 400*0.475=190, 50*0.475=23.75, 4*0.475=1.9. Total:190+23.75=213.75 +1.9=215.65.

So total μ ≈12,000 +2,375 +215.65 ≈14,590.65.

Wait, but looking at the options, the closest μ is 14,500 (option C) with σ=5,900. Hmm, but my σ is about 5,454, which is lower than any of the options. The options have σ values around 5,900 to 6,800.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the z-scores.

Alternatively, maybe I should check if the z-scores are positive. Because sometimes when dealing with 'more than', it's the area to the right, so maybe I should take the positive z-score and subtract from 1.

Wait, let me clarify. If 70% are more than 12,000, then 30% are less than 12,000, which is the 30th percentile. So the z-score is negative. Similarly for 10,000, 20% are less, so z is negative.

But perhaps I should consider the probabilities as P(X > 12,000) = 0.7, so P(X <=12,000)=0.3, which is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express the equations differently. Let me try to write the equations again.

Equation 1:

(12,000 - μ)/σ = z1, where z1 is the z-score for 0.30, which is -0.475.

Equation 2:

(10,000 - μ)/σ = z2, where z2 is -0.8416.

So:

12,000 - μ = -0.475σ
10,000 - μ = -0.8416σ

Subtract equation 2 from equation 1:

(12,000 - μ) - (10,000 - μ) = (-0.475σ) - (-0.8416σ)

Simplify left side: 2,000

Right side: (0.8416 - 0.475)σ = 0.3666σ

So 2,000 = 0.3666σ → σ ≈2,000 /0.3666≈5,454.

Then μ from equation 1: 12,000 - (-0.475*5454) = 12,000 + 0.475*5454.

Compute 0.475 *5454:

0.475 *5,000=2,375.

0.475 *454= 454 *0.4=181.6, 454*0.075=34.05. Total=181.6+34.05=215.65.

So 2,375 +215.65=2,590.65.

So μ =12,000 +2,590.65=14,590.65.

Hmm, the closest option is C: μ=14,500; σ=5,900. But my calculated σ is 5,454, which is lower than 5,900. The options don't have a σ around 5,454. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, maybe I should double-check the z-scores. Let me confirm using a z-table or calculator.

Looking up z for 0.30 cumulative probability: yes, it's about -0.475.

For 0.20, it's about -0.8416, correct.

Wait, perhaps I should use more precise z-scores. Let me check with a calculator.

Using a standard normal table:

For P(Z ≤ z) = 0.30, z ≈ -0.475.

For P(Z ≤ z) = 0.20, z ≈ -0.8416.

So my initial approach is correct.

Now, maybe I made a calculation error in solving the equations.

Let me recompute the equations:

Equation 1: 12,000 = μ - 0.475σ → μ =12,000 +0.475σ

Equation 2: 10,000 = μ -0.8416σ → μ=10,000 +0.8416σ

Set equal:

12,000 +0.475σ =10,000 +0.8416σ

Subtract 10,000: 2,000 +0.475σ =0.8416σ

Subtract 0.475σ: 2,000 =0.3666σ → σ=2,000 /0.3666≈5,454.

So μ=12,000 +0.475*5,454.

Compute 0.475*5,454:

5,454 *0.4=2,181.6

5,454 *0.075=409.05

Total=2,181.6 +409.05=2,590.65

So μ=12,000 +2,590.65=14,590.65≈14,591.

Looking at the options, the closest μ is 14,500 (option C) with σ=5,900. But my σ is 5,454, which is less than 5,900. None of the options match exactly.

Wait, perhaps I should check if the equations were set up correctly. Maybe I should have used the positive z-scores for the right side.

Wait, another approach: sometimes, when dealing with 'more than', it's easier to think in terms of the area to the right. So for 70% more than 12,000, that means 30% are less, so the z-score is negative as I did. Alternatively, sometimes people use the positive z-score for the upper tail.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that for P(X >12,000)=0.7, so P(X <=12,000)=0.3. So the z-score is the 30th percentile, which is negative, as I did.

But perhaps I should use the standard normal table more accurately. Let me check using a more precise z-score.

Using a calculator, the exact z for 0.30 is approximately z=-0.4741.

Similarly, for 0.20, z=-0.8416.

So, let me use these more precise values.

So equation 1: (12,000 - μ)/σ = -0.4741 → 12,000 - μ = -0.4741σ → μ =12,000 +0.4741σ

Equation 2: (10,000 - μ)/σ = -0.8416 →10,000 - μ = -0.8416σ → μ=10,000 +0.8416σ

Set equal:

12,000 +0.4741σ =10,000 +0.8416σ

2,000 = (0.8416 -0.4741)σ → 2,000=0.3675σ → σ=2,000/0.3675≈5,438.

Then μ=12,000 +0.4741*5,438.

Compute 0.4741*5,438:

5,438 *0.4=2,175.2

5,438 *0.0741≈5,438 *0.07=380.66; 5,438 *0.0041≈22.2958.

So total≈2,175.2 +380.66=2,555.86 +22.2958≈2,578.1558.

So μ≈12,000 +2,578.16≈14,578.16.

Again, around 14,578, which is close to 14,500. But the σ is about 5,438, which is not matching any of the options. The options have σ from 5,900 up.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in setting up the equations. Let me think differently.

Alternatively, perhaps I should write the equations in terms of X > values.

So, for 70% of trucks weigh more than 12,000 pounds. That means the 30th percentile is at 12,000. So P(X ≤12,000)=0.30 → z=(12,000-μ)/σ=-0.4741.

Similarly, P(X ≤10,000)=0.20 → z=(10,000-μ)/σ=-0.8416.

So equations are correct.

Hmm, but none of the options match. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the 70% are above 12,000, so maybe the z-score should be positive? Let me think again.

Wait, no. Because if 70% are above 12,000, then 30% are below, so the z-score is indeed negative.

Alternatively, perhaps I should express the equations as:

For 12,000: P(X >12,000)=0.7 → P(X ≤12,000)=0.3 → z=-0.4741.

For 10,000: P(X >10,000)=0.8 → P(X ≤10,000)=0.2 → z=-0.8416.

So equations are correct.

Wait, perhaps I should solve the equations again more accurately.

From equation 1: μ =12,000 +0.4741σ.

From equation 2: μ=10,000 +0.8416σ.

Set equal:

12,000 +0.4741σ =10,000 +0.8416σ → 2,000 =0.3675σ → σ=2,000 /0.3675≈5,438.

Then μ=12,000 +0.4741*5,438≈12,000 +2,578≈14,578.

But looking at the options, the closest is option C: μ=14,500; σ=5,900. But σ is higher here than what I calculated. Alternatively, perhaps the options have rounded the z-scores differently.

Wait, perhaps I should try using z-scores with more decimal places for better accuracy.

Let me check the exact z-scores:

For P(Z ≤ z)=0.30, z=−0.4741.

For P(Z ≤ z)=0.20, z=−0.8416.

So, perhaps the equations are correct, but the options might have used rounded z-scores, leading to slightly different μ and σ.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use a different approach. Let's denote the two equations as:

(12,000 - μ)/σ = a → equation 1

(10,000 - μ)/σ = b → equation 2

Where a and b are the z-scores, a=-0.4741, b=-0.8416.

Subtracting equation 2 from equation 1:

(12,000 - μ - (10,000 - μ))/σ = a - b → 2,000/σ = a - b.

So 2,000/σ = (-0.4741) - (-0.8416) = 0.3675 → σ=2,000 /0.3675≈5,438.

Then μ=12,000 +0.4741*5,438≈12,000 +2,578=14,578.

Hmm, but none of the options match. So perhaps I should check the options again.

Looking at the options, let's see which one is closest.

Option C: μ=14,500; σ=5,900.

If I plug μ=14,500 into equation 1, what's σ?

From equation 1: 12,000 -14,500 = -2,500 = -0.475σ → σ= -2,500 / -0.475≈5,263. But option C says σ=5,900.

Wait, that's not matching. Alternatively, perhaps the options used different z-scores.

Alternatively, perhaps I should check the options by plugging them into the equations.

Let me try option C: μ=14,500; σ=5,900.

Compute z1 for 12,000:

z=(12,000 -14,500)/5,900≈(-2,500)/5,900≈-0.4237.

Looking up z=-0.4237: the cumulative probability is about 0.335, which would mean P(X ≤12,000)=33.5%. But the problem states that 70% are above 12,000, meaning P(X ≤12,000)=30%. So 33.5% is higher than 30%, which would mean that 12,000 is a lower value than the 30th percentile. So this doesn't fit.

Similarly, for 10,000:

z=(10,000 -14,500)/5,900≈-4,500/5,900≈-0.7627.

Cumulative probability for z=-0.7627 is about 0.224, meaning P(X ≤10,000)=22.4%, which is close to 20%. But the problem states 20%, so this is a bit higher. Not exact, but perhaps the options are approximate.

Alternatively, perhaps I should check another option.

Option F: μ=15,100; σ=6,200.

Compute z for 12,000:

z=(12,000 -15,100)/6,200≈-3,100/6,200≈-0.5.

Cumulative probability for z=-0.5 is 0.3085, which is about 30.85%, close to 30%. So P(X ≤12,000)=30.85%, which would mean P(X>12,000)=69.15%. But the problem states 70%, so this is a bit off.

For 10,000:

z=(10,000 -15,100)/6,200≈-5,100/6,200≈-0.8226.

Cumulative probability for z=-0.8226 is about 0.205, which is close to 20%. So this option fits better.

But wait, the first calculation for 12,000 gives 30.85%, which is a bit higher than 30%. So option F might be a possible candidate.

Alternatively, let's check option F's μ=15,100 and σ=6,200.

Compute P(X>12,000):

z=(12,000 -15,100)/6,200≈-3,100/6,200≈-0.5.

P(Z >-0.5)=1 -0.3085=0.6915 or 69.15%, which is close to 70%. Similarly, for 10,000:

z=(10,000 -15,100)/6,200≈-5,100/6,200≈-0.8226.

P(Z >-0.8226)=1 -0.205=0.795 or 79.5%, but the problem states that 80% are above 10,000. So this is quite close.

So option F gives:

- P(X>12,000)≈69.15% (close to 70%)

- P(X>10,000)≈79.5% (close to 80%)

But the problem states exactly 70% and 80%, so perhaps this is the intended answer.

Alternatively, let me check option D: μ=15,300; σ=6,300.

For 12,000:

z=(12,000-15,300)/6,300≈-3,300/6,300≈-0.5238.

Cumulative probability for z=-0.5238 is about 0.30, which is exactly 30%. So P(X>12,000)=70%, which matches.

For 10,000:

z=(10,000 -15,300)/6,300≈-5,300/6,300≈-0.8413.

Cumulative probability for z=-0.8413 is about 0.20, which matches the 20% given.

Wow, that's exact. So option D: μ=15,300; σ=6,300.

Wait, but earlier my calculation gave μ≈14,578 and σ≈5,438, which doesn't match any option. But when I tried option D, it fits perfectly.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in my initial equations. Let me check again.

If μ=15,300 and σ=6,300,

For 12,000: z=(12,000-15,300)/6,300≈-3,300/6,300≈-0.5238.

Looking up z=-0.5238: the cumulative probability is indeed around 0.30, which matches 30% below and 70% above.

For 10,000: z=(10,000-15,300)/6,300≈-5,300/6,300≈-0.8413.

Cumulative probability is 0.20, which matches the 20% below and 80% above.

So option D fits perfectly.

But earlier, when I solved the equations, I arrived at μ≈14,578 and σ≈5,438, which isn't one of the options. But option D must be correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in setting up the equations. Let me check the equations again.

Wait, no, the equations are correct. So perhaps I made a calculation error in solving them.

Wait, if option D gives the exact z-scores needed, then perhaps that's the correct answer, and I must have made an error in my initial calculation.

Let me try solving the equations again with the exact z-scores.

We have:

(12,000 - μ)/σ = -0.4741 → equation 1

(10,000 - μ)/σ = -0.8416 → equation 2

Subtract equation 2 from equation 1:

(12,000 - μ) - (10,000 - μ) = (-0.4741σ) - (-0.8416σ)

Simplify:

2,000 = (0.8416 - 0.4741)σ → 2,000 = 0.3675σ → σ=2,000 /0.3675≈5,438.

Then μ=12,000 +0.4741*5,438≈12,000 +2,578≈14,578.

But option D has μ=15,300 and σ=6,300.

Wait, perhaps the z-scores I used are approximate. Let me check using more precise z-scores.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to use the closest z-scores, leading to option D.

Alternatively, perhaps I should solve the equations using the exact z-scores from the problem, leading to option D.

Wait, perhaps I should set up the equations using the exact z-scores that give the precise probabilities.

Given that for 70% above 12,000, the z-score is such that P(Z > z) =0.70 → P(Z ≤z)=0.30 → z=invNorm(0.30)= -0.4741.

Similarly, for 80% above 10,000, P(Z > z)=0.80 → P(Z ≤z)=0.20 → z=invNorm(0.20)= -0.8416.

So the equations are correct.

But when I solve them, I get μ≈14,578 and σ≈5,438, which is not an option. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the z-scores are positive because we're dealing with 'more than', but I'm not sure. Let me try that approach.

If I consider that P(X >12,000)=0.70, which is the area to the right, then the z-score would be positive, such that P(Z <z)=0.70 → z=0.5241.

Similarly, P(X >10,000)=0.80 → P(Z <z)=0.80 → z=0.8416.

Wait, that's a different approach. So perhaps I should set up the equations using positive z-scores.

So, for 12,000:

(12,000 - μ)/σ = 0.5241 → equation 1

For 10,000:

(10,000 - μ)/σ = 0.8416 → equation 2

Wait, but that can't be right because if 70% are above 12,000, then the z-score should be positive. Let me think.

Wait, no. Because when X >12,000, the z-score is (12,000 - μ)/σ = z, and since 70% are above, the area to the right is 0.7, so the z-score is such that P(Z > z)=0.7 → z= invNorm(0.70)=0.5241.

Wait, no. Wait, wait. Let me clarify.

If P(X >12,000)=0.7, then P(X ≤12,000)=0.3, which corresponds to z=invNorm(0.30)= -0.4741.

Alternatively, if I think in terms of P(Z >z)=0.7, then z= invNorm(1 -0.7)= invNorm(0.30)= -0.4741.

So, the earlier approach is correct.

But perhaps I should think differently. Let me try to set up the equations using the positive z-scores for the right tail.

So, for X=12,000:

P(X >12,000)=0.7 → P(Z > z)=0.7 → z= invNorm(1 -0.7)= invNorm(0.30)= -0.4741.

Similarly, for X=10,000:

P(X >10,000)=0.8 → z= invNorm(0.20)= -0.8416.

So, the equations are correct as before.

But then, solving them gives μ≈14,578 and σ≈5,438, which is not an option.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in transposing the equations.

Let me write the equations again:

Equation 1: (12,000 - μ)/σ = -0.4741 → 12,000 - μ = -0.4741σ → μ =12,000 +0.4741σ.

Equation 2: (10,000 - μ)/σ = -0.8416 →10,000 - μ = -0.8416σ → μ=10,000 +0.8416σ.

Set equal:

12,000 +0.4741σ =10,000 +0.8416σ → 2,000 = (0.8416 -0.4741)σ → 2,000=0.3675σ → σ=2,000/0.3675≈5,438.

Then μ=12,000 +0.4741*5,438≈12,000 +2,578=14,578.

But none of the options match this. So perhaps the options are using rounded z-scores.

Alternatively, perhaps I should check the options' z-scores.

Looking at option D: μ=15,300; σ=6,300.

Compute z for 12,000:

z=(12,000 -15,300)/6,300≈-3,300/6,300≈-0.5238.

Looking up z=-0.5238: the cumulative probability is 0.30, which matches 30% below and 70% above.

For 10,000:

z=(10,000 -15,300)/6,300≈-5,300/6,300≈-0.8413.

Cumulative probability is 0.20, which matches 20% below and 80% above.

So option D perfectly fits the given conditions.

Therefore, the correct answer must be option D: μ=15,300; σ=6,300.

The problem involves determining the mean (μ) and standard deviation (σ) of truck weights, which are normally distributed. The given data points are:

- 70% of trucks weigh more than 12,000 pounds, implying 30% weigh less than or equal to 12,000 pounds.
- 80% of trucks weigh more than 10,000 pounds, implying 20% weigh less than or equal to 10,000 pounds.

Using the properties of the normal distribution, the z-scores corresponding to these percentiles are:

- For 30%: \( z = -0.4741 \)
- For 20%: \( z = -0.8416 \)

Setting up the equations:

1. \( \frac{12,000 - \mu}{\sigma} = -0.4741 \)
2. \( \frac{10,000 - \mu}{\sigma} = -0.8416 \)

Rearranging and solving these equations:

From equation 1:  
\( 12,000 - \mu = -0.4741\sigma \)  
\( \mu = 12,000 + 0.4741\sigma \)

From equation 2:  
\( 10,000 - \mu = -0.8416\sigma \)  
\( \mu = 10,000 + 0.8416\sigma \)

Equating the two expressions for \( \mu \):  
\( 12,000 + 0.4741\sigma = 10,000 + 0.8416\sigma \)  
\( 2,000 = (0.8416 - 0.4741)\sigma \)  
\( 2,000 = 0.3675\sigma \)  
\( \sigma \approx 5,438 \)

Substituting \( \sigma \) back into equation 1:  
\( \mu = 12,000 + 0.4741 \times 5,438 \approx 14,578 \)

However, none of the options match these calculated values. Re-evaluating the options, option D (\( \mu = 15,300; \sigma = 6,300 \)) fits perfectly:

- For 12,000 pounds:  
  \( z = \frac{12,000 - 15,300}{6,300} \approx -0.5238 \), corresponding to \( P(X \leq 12,000) = 0.30 \), matching the 70% above.

- For 10,000 pounds:  
  \( z = \frac{10,000 - 15,300}{6,300} \approx -0.8413 \), corresponding to \( P(X \leq 10,000) = 0.20 \), matching the 80% above.

Thus, option D is correct.

**Answer: D**
