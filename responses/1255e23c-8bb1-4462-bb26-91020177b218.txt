Question:

A 42-year-old man comes to the physician because of malaise, muscle and joint pain, and temperatures to 38.4°C (101.1°F) for 3 days. Three months ago, he underwent cadaveric renal transplantation resulting in immediate kidney function. At the time of discharge, his serum creatinine concentration was 0.8 mg/dL. He is receiving cyclosporine and corticosteroids. Examination shows no abnormalities. His leukocyte count is 2700/mm3 , and serum creatinine concentration is 1.6 mg/dL; serum cyclosporine concentration is in the therapeutic range. A biopsy of the transplanted kidney shows intracellular inclusion bodies. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?

Options:

A: Increase the dosage of corticosteroids
B: Begin amphotericin therapy
C: Increase the dosage of cyclosporine
D: Perform a second kidney transplant
E: Discontinue all medications and monitor the patient's condition
F: Begin ganciclovir therapy
G: Begin interferon therapy
H: Decrease the dosage of cyclosporine
I: Decrease the dosage of corticosteroids
J: Begin acyclovir therapy

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about a patient who had a kidney transplant and is now presenting with some symptoms. Let's break it down step by step.

The patient is a 42-year-old man with malaise, muscle and joint pain, and a fever up to 38.4°C for three days. He had a cadaveric renal transplant three months ago, and it worked well initially since his creatinine was 0.8 mg/dL at discharge. Now his creatinine is up to 1.6 mg/dL. He's on cyclosporine and corticosteroids, and his cyclosporine levels are therapeutic. The exam didn't show any abnormalities, but his WBC count is low at 2700/mm³. The kidney biopsy shows intracellular inclusion bodies.

Hmm, so let's think about possible causes. The symptoms include fever, malaise, muscle pain, and joint pain, which are common in viral infections. But given his recent transplant and immunosuppressive therapy, he's at higher risk for infections. But the biopsy showing inclusion bodies makes me think of specific infections that cause those.

Inclusion bodies are seen in certain viral infections. CMV (cytomegalovirus) is a big one because it often causes inclusion bodies in transplanted patients. CMV can present with fever, fatigue, and muscle aches, and it's a common opportunistic infection post-transplant. Another possibility is toxoplasmosis, but that's less common in this context.

His WBC count is low, which makes sense because immunosuppressive drugs can suppress the immune system, making it harder to fight infections. The elevated creatinine suggests possible kidney graft dysfunction, which could be due to rejection or infection (like CMV nephritis). But the question is about the next step in management.

Looking at the options:

A: Increase corticosteroids - Steroids can increase immunosuppression, which might not be the best idea if there's an infection, especially a viral one. Plus, steroids are often used for rejection, but if it's CMV, more steroids might not help and could worsen the situation.

B: Begin amphotericin therapy - Amphotericin is for fungal infections. I don't think this is the case here unless there's a fungal cause, which doesn't seem likely given the inclusion bodies and presentation.

C: Increase cyclosporine - Cyclosporine is an immunosuppressant. Increasing it might help with rejection but could make infection worse. Plus, the question says the level is already in the therapeutic range, so maybe that's not the issue.

D: Second transplant - That seems extreme and unlikely necessary unless the current graft is failing irreversibly, which isn't indicated here.

E: Discontinue all meds and monitor - That's dangerous because he needs immunosuppression. Discontinuing would risk rejection, which is worse than the infection in most cases.

F: Begin ganciclovir therapy - Ganciclovir is an antiviral used for CMV. If the inclusion bodies are CMV, this would be appropriate.

G: Interferon therapy - That's more for viral hepatitis or maybe some other viral infections. Not sure about CMV.

H: Decrease cyclosporine - Reducing immunosuppression might not be helpful if there's an active infection. Plus, his levels are already okay.

I: Decrease corticosteroids - Similar to H, reducing could increase risk of rejection. Maybe if the patient is stable, but not sure.

J: Acyclovir therapy - Acyclovir is for herpes viruses like HSV or VZV. CMV isn't typically treated with acyclovir; ganciclovir is better.

So putting it together, the presence of inclusion bodies points towards a viral infection, likely CMV. The appropriate treatment for CMV is ganciclovir. So the answer should be F.

The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of an infection, elevated creatinine, and intracellular inclusion bodies on biopsy, which points to a viral etiology such as CMV. Given the immunosuppressive therapy, ganciclovir is the appropriate treatment. 

Answer: F
