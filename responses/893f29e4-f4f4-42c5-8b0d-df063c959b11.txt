Okay, so I have this problem here: 48 meters equals Box millimeters. I need to find the correct number from the options given. Hmm, let me think about how to convert meters to millimeters. 

Wait, I remember that the metric system uses prefixes, right? So, meters can be converted to other units like centimeters, decimeters, etc. Oh yeah, millimeters are a smaller unit than meters. Let me recall the conversion factors. 

I think 1 meter is equal to 100 centimeters, and each centimeter is 10 millimeters. So, to get from meters to millimeters, I need to multiply by 1000 because 1 meter equals 1000 millimeters. Wait, yeah, because 1 m = 10 dm, 1 dm = 10 cm, 1 cm = 10 mm. So 10 * 10 * 10 = 1000 mm per meter. 

So, if I have 48 meters, I need to multiply 48 by 1000 to get millimeters. Let me do that calculation: 48 * 1000 equals 48,000. Wait, but looking at the options, I see option B is 48,000. So that must be the correct answer. 

Wait a second, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Another way to check is to think about smaller numbers. Like, 1 m is 1000 mm, so 48 m would be 48 times that. So 48 * 1000 is 48,000 mm. Yep, that seems right. So the answer should be option B.

The correct conversion from meters to millimeters involves multiplying by 1000. Therefore, 48 meters equals 48,000 millimeters.

Answer: B
