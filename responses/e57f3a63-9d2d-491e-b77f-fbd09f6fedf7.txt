Okay, so I've got this problem about an ideal gas, and I need to find the number of moles. Let's see, the given information is temperature, pressure, and volume. I remember from my chemistry class that the ideal gas law is PV = nRT. Yeah, that's the one. So I'll need to use that formula to find n, the number of moles.

First, let's list out what's given. The temperature is 27°C. Oh wait, but the gas law uses Kelvin, right? So I need to convert that. To convert Celsius to Kelvin, I add 273. So 27 + 273 is 300 K. Got that.

Next, the pressure is 380 torr. Hmm, I think pressure can be in different units. The R value given is in liters·atm/(mole·°C), so I need to make sure the pressure is in atm. I remember that 1 atm is 760 torr. So to convert 380 torr to atm, I'll divide by 760. Let me calculate that: 380 / 760 equals... Half of 380 is 190, so 380 is half of 760, so that's 0.5 atm. Wait, no, wait. 380 is half of 760, so 380 torr is 0.5 atm? Wait, 760 is 1 atm, so 380 is exactly half, so yes, 0.5 atm. Okay, that's right.

The volume is 492 cm³. Oh, but R is in liters, so I need to convert cm³ to liters. I remember that 1 liter is 1000 cm³. So 492 cm³ is 492 / 1000 liters, which is 0.492 liters. Got it.

Now, R is given as 0.082 L·atm/(mol·K). So putting it all into the equation PV = nRT, I can rearrange it to solve for n: n = PV/(RT).

Let me plug in the numbers. P is 0.5 atm, V is 0.492 L, R is 0.082, T is 300 K.

So n = (0.5 atm * 0.492 L) / (0.082 * 300 K).

Let me calculate the numerator first: 0.5 * 0.492 is 0.246. Then the denominator: 0.082 * 300. Let's do 0.08 * 300 is 24, and 0.002 * 300 is 0.6, so together it's 24.6.

So n = 0.246 / 24.6. Let me compute that. 0.246 divided by 24.6. Hmm, 24.6 goes into 0.246 about 0.01 times because 24.6 * 0.01 is 0.246. So n is 0.01 moles.

Wait, looking at the options, option G is 0.0100 moles. So that must be the answer. But wait, let me double-check my calculations. Did I mix up any units?

Wait, pressure: yes, 380 torr is 0.5 atm. Volume: 492 cm³ is 0.492 L. Temperature is 300 K. R is 0.082. So 0.5 * 0.492 = 0.246. 0.082 * 300 = 24.6. 0.246 / 24.6 = 0.01. Yep, that's correct.

So the number of moles is 0.01, which is option G.

To determine the number of moles of an ideal gas, we use the ideal gas law: \( PV = nRT \). Rearranging for \( n \), we get:

\[
n = \frac{PV}{RT}
\]

**Given:**
- Temperature (\( T \)) = \( 27^\circ \text{C} \) → Convert to Kelvin: \( 27 + 273 = 300 \, \text{K} \)
- Pressure (\( P \)) = \( 380 \, \text{torr} \) → Convert to atm: \( \frac{380}{760} = 0.5 \, \text{atm} \)
- Volume (\( V \)) = \( 492 \, \text{cm}^3 \) → Convert to liters: \( \frac{492}{1000} = 0.492 \, \text{L} \)
- \( R = 0.082 \, \text{L·atm/(mol·K)} \)

**Substitute into the formula:**

\[
n = \frac{(0.5 \, \text{atm})(0.492 \, \text{L})}{(0.082 \, \text{L·atm/(mol·K)})(300 \, \text{K})}
\]

**Calculate the numerator:**

\[
0.5 \times 0.492 = 0.246
\]

**Calculate the denominator:**

\[
0.082 \times 300 = 24.6
\]

**Divide:**

\[
n = \frac{0.246}{24.6} = 0.01 \, \text{mol}
\]

Thus, the number of moles is \( 0.0100 \), which corresponds to option **G**.
