Alright, so I've got this problem here about heat transfer through radiation between two concentric aluminum spheres. Let me try to break this down step by step. 

First, the setup: there's an inner sphere with radius 0.75 ft that contains liquefied oxygen. The outer sphere has a radius of 1.0 ft and is kept at 45°F. The boiling point of oxygen is -297°F, which I think means that the inner sphere is at that temperature, right? Because if it's liquefied oxygen, it's probably just at its boiling point to stay liquid. So the inner temperature T_in is -297°F, and the outer temperature T_out is 45°F. 

The question is asking for the rate of heat flow to the oxygen by radiation. So I think this is a radiation heat transfer problem between two surfaces. Since the spheres are concentric, it's a spherical geometry problem. 

I remember that the formula for heat transfer by radiation is Q = εσAΔT, where ε is emissivity, σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, A is the surface area, and ΔT is the temperature difference in Kelvin or absolute terms. Wait, no, actually, the formula is a bit more specific. For radiation between two surfaces, it's the sum of radiation emitted by each surface towards the other. But I think in this case, since one is at a lower temperature than the other, only the outer sphere is radiating heat into the inner sphere. Or wait, no, because the inner sphere is colder, so heat flows from the outer (warmer) to the inner (colder) sphere. 

Wait, but the formula is Q = εσA (T1^4 - T2^4), where T1 is the higher temperature and T2 is the lower. So I think that's the right approach. 

Wait, but which surface area do I use? The inner sphere or the outer? I think in radiation between two concentric spheres, the heat transfer depends on the surface area of the outer sphere because the inner sphere's surface is inside the outer sphere's cavity. So the outer sphere's surface area is what matters for the radiation. 

Wait, no, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The space between the two spheres is evacuated, so it's a vacuum, but radiation still occurs between the inner and outer surfaces. The heat is emitted from the outer sphere and absorbed by the inner sphere. So the area involved is the surface area of the outer sphere because that's the area from which the radiation is coming. Alternatively, sometimes in such problems, the area used is the area of the inner surface, but I'm not entirely sure. 

Wait, another approach: the radiation heat transfer rate can be calculated using the formula for a single surface when the other is at a different temperature. But in some cases, especially when one surface is much larger, you can approximate. But in this case, both surfaces are spheres, so perhaps the correct approach is to consider the outer sphere's surface area as the area from which radiation is emitted towards the inner sphere. 

Wait, no, perhaps the correct formula for radiation between two concentric spheres is Q = (εσ (T_hot^4 - T_cold^4) ) * (A_inner + A_outer) / (A_inner * A_outer) )? Or maybe not. I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, maybe I should look up the formula for radiation between two concentric spheres. Oh wait, I can't look it up, but I can think through it. 

In radiation, the heat transfer from a surface depends on its area and the temperature difference. If the space between the spheres is evacuated, the inner and outer surfaces are at different temperatures. The outer sphere is at 45°F, and the inner at -297°F. So the outer sphere will radiate heat towards the inner sphere. 

The formula for radiation heat transfer between two surfaces is Q = εσ (A) (T1^4 - T2^4) / (1 - (T2/T1)^4) )? No, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Q = εσ (T1^4 - T2^4) * (A1 A2) / (A1 + A2) ), but I'm not sure. 

Wait, maybe it's simpler. I think the heat transfer via radiation in such a setup is given by Q = εσ (T_outer^4 - T_inner^4) * (A_inner * A_outer) / (A_inner + A_outer). Or perhaps it's just the area of the outer sphere because the inner sphere is inside and the outer is the one emitting heat. 

Alternatively, I've heard of the formula where the effective area is the harmonic mean of the areas when dealing with radiation between two surfaces. So maybe the formula is Q = εσ (T1^4 - T2^4) * (A1 A2) / (A1 + A2). Let me check the units to see if that makes sense. 

But wait, another thought: the radiation emitted by the outer sphere is received by the inner sphere. The outer sphere's surface area is 4πR², where R is 1.0 ft. The inner sphere's surface area is 4πr², where r is 0.75 ft. The radiation emitted by the outer sphere is proportional to its area, but the inner sphere absorbs it. However, in some cases, especially when the outer sphere is larger, the inner sphere's surface area is what matters. Hmm, perhaps it's the area of the inner sphere that we should use because that's where the heat is being deposited. 

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me try to think of it as a simple radiation transfer between two surfaces. The formula for heat transfer between two surfaces at different temperatures with emissivity ε is Q = εσ (T1^4 - T2^4) * (A1 A2) / (A1 + A2). I think that's right because it's similar to the formula for electrical resistors in parallel. So each surface emits radiation, but the effective area is the harmonic mean. 

So let's compute that. First, convert the temperatures from Fahrenheit to Kelvin. Because radiation formulas require absolute temperatures. 

T_outer = 45°F. To Kelvin: (45 + 459.67) = 504.67 K. 

T_inner = -297°F. To Kelvin: (-297 + 459.67) = 162.67 K. 

Emissivity ε is given as 0.03. 

Now, compute the areas. 

A_outer = 4π (1.0 ft)^2 = 4π ft² ≈ 12.566 ft². 

A_inner = 4π (0.75 ft)^2 = 4π * 0.5625 ≈ 7.0686 ft². 

Now, plug into the formula:

Q = εσ (T1^4 - T2^4) * (A1 A2) / (A1 + A2) 

Wait, but wait, is T1 the outer or inner? Since the outer is hotter, T1 is 504.67 K, and T2 is 162.67 K. 

So compute T1^4 and T2^4.

Compute T1^4: 504.67^4. Let me approximate. 500^4 is 500*500*500*500 = 6.25e11. But more accurately, let's compute 504.67^4.

Wait, maybe using a calculator would be faster, but since I'm just thinking, perhaps I can approximate.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the ratio (T1^4 - T2^4) first. Let me compute each term:

T1^4 = (504.67)^4 ≈ let's compute 504.67^2 first. 504.67 * 504.67 ≈ (500 + 4.67)^2 ≈ 500² + 2*500*4.67 + 4.67² ≈ 250000 + 4670 + 21.8 ≈ 254,691.8. Then square that: (254,691.8)^2. That's a huge number, but perhaps I can compute it as approximately 6.48e11 (I think 5e5^2 is 2.5e11, but 254k squared is about 6.45e11).

Similarly, T2^4 = (162.67)^4. First, (162.67)^2 ≈ 26,460. Then square that: ~6.99e8.

So T1^4 - T2^4 ≈ 6.48e11 - 7e8 ≈ 6.48e11, since 7e8 is negligible compared to 6.48e11.

But maybe I should compute it more accurately. Alternatively, perhaps I can just compute the difference as (T1^4 - T2^4) = (504.67^4 - 162.67^4). But without exact calculation, perhaps I can proceed with approximate values.

So let's proceed:

(T1^4 - T2^4) ≈ 6.48e11 - 6.99e8 ≈ 6.48e11 (since 6.99e8 is much smaller).

Now, the term (A1 A2)/(A1 + A2) = (12.566 * 7.0686)/(12.566 +7.0686) ≈ (90.07)/(19.6346) ≈ 4.585.

So now, Q = εσ * (6.48e11) * 4.585.

Wait, but wait, the Stefan-Boltzmann constant σ is 5.67e-8 W/m²·K^4. But wait, the area is in square feet, so I need to convert units to meters to use this constant. Oh wait, this could complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula in imperial units, but I'm not sure if that's possible. Maybe I can use the formula in terms of BTU.

Wait, I think the Stefan-Boltzmann constant in imperial units is 0.173986e-8 Btu/(hr·ft²·K^4). Or maybe I should look it up, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can proceed with the calculation using the given numbers and see.

Wait, let me double-check the formula. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula as:

Q = εσ (T1^4 - T2^4) * (A_inner + A_outer) / (A_inner * A_outer) )? No, that doesn't seem right. Maybe I'm confusing it with something else.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The correct formula for radiation between two concentric spheres is actually the same as that for a single surface with the other being at a different temperature, but perhaps the area is that of the inner sphere. Or maybe it's the area of the outer sphere. I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the heat transfer is determined by the surface area of the inner sphere because that's where the heat is being deposited. So the formula would be Q = εσ A_inner (T1^4 - T2^4) / (something).

Wait, let's try a different approach. The heat transfer rate through radiation can be calculated using the formula:

Q = (εσ A (T1^4 - T2^4)) / (1 - (T2/T1)^4)

But I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps it's simply Q = εσ A (T1^4 - T2^4), where A is the surface area of the inner sphere, since that's where the heat is absorbed. 

Wait, maybe I should refer to the concept of radiation between two concentric spheres. In such a case, the heat transfer rate is given by:

Q = εσ (T1^4 - T2^4) * (A1 A2) / (A1 + A2)

Where A1 is the area of the outer sphere, and A2 is the area of the inner sphere. This formula effectively considers the radiation emitted by the outer sphere and absorbed by the inner sphere, taking into account the inverse square law and the areas involved.

So let's proceed with that.

Compute A1 = 4π*(1.0)^2 = ~12.566 ft².

A2 = 4π*(0.75)^2 = ~7.0686 ft².

So (A1 A2)/(A1 + A2) = (12.566 *7.0686)/(12.566 +7.0686) = (90.07)/(19.6346) ≈4.585.

Now, compute (T1^4 - T2^4):

T1 = 504.67 K.

T2 = 162.67 K.

Compute T1^4: 504.67^4 ≈ (504.67)^2 squared. As before, 504.67^2 ≈ 254,691. Then 254,691^2 ≈ 6.48e11.

T2^4: 162.67^4 ≈ (162.67^2)^2. 162.67^2 ≈ 26,460, then 26,460^2 ≈ 6.99e8.

So T1^4 - T2^4 ≈ 6.48e11 - 0.699e9 ≈ approximately 6.48e11.

Now, multiply by εσ: ε =0.03, σ=5.67e-8 W/m²·K^4. Wait, but the area is in square feet, so I need to convert the area to square meters to use this σ. Alternatively, perhaps I should use σ in Btu units.

Wait, I think the Stefan-Boltzmann constant in imperial units is approximately 0.173986e-8 Btu/(hr·ft²·K^4). Let me confirm: yes, σ ≈ 0.000000173986 Btu/(hr·ft²·K^4).

So now, putting it all together:

Q = εσ (T1^4 - T2^4) * (A1 A2)/(A1 + A2)

Plugging in the numbers:

Q = 0.03 * 0.000000173986 * (6.48e11) *4.585

First, compute 0.03 * 0.000000173986 ≈ 5.21958e-9.

Then multiply by 6.48e11: 5.21958e-9 *6.48e11 ≈ (5.21958 *6.48) * 1e2 ≈ 33.75 * 100 ≈ 3375.

Now, multiply by 4.585: 3375 *4.585 ≈ let's compute 3375*4 =13,500; 3375*0.585 ≈ 1,979.625. So total ≈13,500 +1,979.625 ≈15,479.625 Btu/hr.

Wait, that's way higher than any of the options given. The options are around 10-25 Btu/hr. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Hmm, perhaps I messed up the area calculation. Let me check the area again. Wait, wait, no, the area is correct: 4π*(1)^2 = 12.566 ft², and 4π*(0.75)^2 = 7.0686 ft².

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the unit conversion for σ. Let me double-check the value of σ in Btu/(hr·ft²·K^4). I think the correct value is 0.000000173986 Btu/(hr·ft²·K^4), which is 1.73986e-8 Btu/(hr·ft²·K^4). Wait, I think I used 0.000000173986, which is 1.73986e-7, which is wrong. The correct value is 1.73986e-8.

So let's recalculate:

ε =0.03,

σ=1.73986e-8 Btu/(hr·ft²·K^4).

So Q = 0.03 * 1.73986e-8 *6.48e11 *4.585

Compute each step:

0.03 *1.73986e-8 =5.21958e-10.

5.21958e-10 *6.48e11 =5.21958e-10 *6.48e11 = (5.21958 *6.48) * 1e( -10 +11 )= (33.75) *10^1=337.5.

Now, multiply by 4.585: 337.5 *4.585 ≈ let's compute 337.5 *4 =1350, and 337.5 *0.585≈197.9625. So total≈1350 +197.9625=1547.9625 Btu/hr.

Still way too high. The options are way lower. So I must have made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula for radiation between two surfaces where the heat transfer is Q = εσ (T1^4 - T2^4) * (A1 + A2)/(A1*A2) ). But that doesn't make sense dimensionally.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the inner sphere's surface area is what matters. So using A_inner =7.0686 ft².

So Q = εσ A_inner (T1^4 - T2^4)

But let's compute that:

0.03 *1.73986e-8 *7.0686 *6.48e11.

Compute step by step:

0.03 *1.73986e-8 =5.21958e-10.

5.21958e-10 *7.0686 ≈3.684e-9.

3.684e-9 *6.48e11 ≈3.684e-9 *6.48e11 = (3.684 *6.48) *1e( -9 +11 )= 23.89 *1e2=2389 Btu/hr.

Still too high.

Wait, perhaps the formula is simply Q = εσ A_outer (T1^4 - T2^4)/(1 + (T2/T1)^4). No, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the correct formula is Q = εσ (T1^4 - T2^4) * (A_inner + A_outer)/(2 * A_inner * A_outer). No, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let's try a different approach. Perhaps the heat transfer is simply calculated using the formula for a single surface, considering the outer sphere as the emitter and the inner as the absorber. So the formula would be Q = εσ A_inner (T_outer^4 - T_inner^4).

Wait, that might make sense because the inner sphere is absorbing radiation from the outer sphere. So the area to use is the area of the inner sphere, as that's where the heat is being deposited.

So let's compute that:

Q = εσ A_inner (T_outer^4 - T_inner^4).

Compute each part:

A_inner =7.0686 ft².

ε=0.03,

σ=1.73986e-8 Btu/(hr·ft²·K^4).

T_outer=504.67 K,

T_inner=162.67 K.

Compute (T_outer^4 - T_inner^4) = (504.67^4 -162.67^4).

As before, 504.67^4 ≈6.48e11,

162.67^4≈7e8,

So difference≈6.48e11.

So Q=0.03 *1.73986e-8 *7.0686 *6.48e11.

Compute step by step:

0.03 *1.73986e-8 =5.21958e-10.

Multiply by 7.0686:5.21958e-10 *7.0686≈3.684e-9.

Multiply by 6.48e11:3.684e-9 *6.48e11=3.684e-9 *6.48e11= (3.684 *6.48) *1e( -9 +11 )=23.89 *1e2=2389 Btu/hr.

Still too high. The options don't go that high. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the outer sphere is at 45°F and the inner at -297°F, but the formula requires the temperatures in absolute terms, which I did. So that's correct.

Wait, maybe the problem is that the outer sphere is at a higher temperature, so it's emitting radiation, and the inner sphere is absorbing it. So the formula should be Q = εσ A_outer (T_outer^4 - T_inner^4) / (something). Or perhaps the formula is Q = εσ (T_outer^4 - T_inner^4) * (A_outer + A_inner)/(2 * A_inner * A_outer). I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to use the formula for radiation between two concentric spheres, which is Q = (εσ (T1^4 - T2^4)) * (A1 + A2)/(A1 * A2).

Let me compute that:

A1 =12.566,

A2=7.0686,

So (A1 + A2)=19.6346,

(A1*A2)=90.07.

So (A1 + A2)/(A1*A2)=19.6346/90.07≈0.218.

Now, Q= εσ (T1^4 - T2^4) *0.218.

Compute εσ=0.03*1.73986e-8≈5.21958e-10.

(T1^4 - T2^4)=6.48e11.

So Q=5.21958e-10 *6.48e11 *0.218 ≈5.21958e-10 *6.48e11=337.5, then *0.218≈73.53 Btu/hr.

Still higher than the options given.

Wait, perhaps the formula is Q= εσ (T1^4 - T2^4) * (A_inner)/(A_outer + A_inner).

So let's compute that.

A_inner=7.0686,

A_outer + A_inner=19.6346.

So (A_inner)/(A_outer + A_inner)=7.0686/19.6346≈0.36.

Now, Q=5.21958e-10 *6.48e11 *0.36 ≈5.21958e-10 *6.48e11=337.5 *0.36≈121.5 Btu/hr.

Still too high.

Hmm, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula for radiation between two concentric spheres is simply Q= εσ (T_outer^4 - T_inner^4) * (A_inner + A_outer)/(2 * A_inner). Or maybe it's the area of the outer sphere, because the inner sphere is inside and the outer is the one emitting. So Q= εσ A_outer (T_outer^4 - T_inner^4)/(1 + (A_inner/A_outer)).

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is Q= εσ (T_outer^4 - T_inner^4) * (A_outer * A_inner)/(A_outer + A_inner).

Wait, let's compute that.

(A_outer * A_inner)/(A_outer + A_inner)=90.07/19.6346≈4.585.

So Q= εσ (T1^4 - T2^4) *4.585.

Compute:

εσ=0.03 *1.73986e-8≈5.21958e-10.

(T1^4 - T2^4)=6.48e11.

So 5.21958e-10 *6.48e11=337.5.

Multiply by4.585: 337.5 *4.585≈1547 Btu/hr. Again, way too high.

Hmm, perhaps I'm using the wrong formula. Maybe it's simply the radiation from the outer sphere to the inner sphere, considering the outer sphere's surface area. So Q= εσ A_outer (T_outer^4 - T_inner^4).

Compute that:

A_outer=12.566,

Q=0.03 *1.73986e-8 *12.566 *6.48e11.

Compute step by step:

0.03 *1.73986e-8=5.21958e-10.

Multiply by12.566:5.21958e-10 *12.566≈6.56e-9.

Multiply by6.48e11:6.56e-9 *6.48e11≈6.56e-9 *6.48e11= (6.56 *6.48) *1e( -9 +11 )=42.63 *1e2=4263 Btu/hr.

No, that's even higher. Clearly, this approach is leading me astray.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the problem differently. Maybe the area to consider is the inner sphere's area because that's where the heat is being deposited. So the formula would be Q= εσ A_inner (T_outer^4 - T_inner^4).

Compute:

A_inner=7.0686.

So Q=0.03 *1.73986e-8 *7.0686 *6.48e11.

Compute step by step:

0.03 *1.73986e-8=5.21958e-10.

Multiply by7.0686:5.21958e-10 *7.0686≈3.684e-9.

Multiply by6.48e11:3.684e-9 *6.48e11=2389 Btu/hr.

Still way too high. The options are all much lower. So perhaps I'm missing something in the formula.

Wait, perhaps I should use the surface area of the outer sphere, but the formula is Q= εσ A_outer (T_outer^4 - T_inner^4).

Compute:

0.03 *1.73986e-8 *12.566 *6.48e11.

Which gives 0.03 *1.73986e-8=5.21958e-10.

5.21958e-10 *12.566=6.56e-9.

6.56e-9 *6.48e11=4263 Btu/hr.

No, that's not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps I'm using the wrong formula. Maybe the correct formula is Q= εσ (T_outer^4 - T_inner^4) * (A_outer - A_inner)/(A_outer + A_inner). No, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Q= εσ (T_outer^4 - T_inner^4) * (A_outer/(A_outer + A_inner)).

Compute:

A_outer/(A_outer + A_inner)=12.566/(12.566+7.0686)=12.566/19.6346≈0.639.

So Q=0.03 *1.73986e-8 *6.48e11 *0.639.

Compute:

0.03 *1.73986e-8=5.21958e-10.

5.21958e-10 *6.48e11=337.5.

337.5 *0.639≈215.36 Btu/hr.

Still higher than the options.

Wait, maybe I should consider that the emissivity is the same for both surfaces, and the radiation is emitted from the outer and absorbed by the inner. So perhaps the formula is Q= εσ (T_outer^4 - T_inner^4) * (A_inner/(A_outer + A_inner)).

Compute:

A_inner/(A_outer + A_inner)=7.0686/19.6346≈0.36.

So Q=0.03 *1.73986e-8 *6.48e11 *0.36.

Which is 5.21958e-10 *6.48e11=337.5.

Multiply by0.36:337.5 *0.36≈121.5 Btu/hr.

Still too high.

Wait, perhaps I've made a mistake in the temperature conversion. Let me double-check.

T_outer=45°F. To Kelvin: 45 + 459.67=504.67 K. Correct.

T_inner=-297°F. To Kelvin: -297 +459.67=162.67 K. Correct.

So temperatures are correct.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula Q= εσ (T_outer^4 - T_inner^4) * (A_inner * A_outer)/(A_inner + A_outer).

Which is the same as (A1*A2)/(A1+A2)=4.585 as before.

So Q=0.03 *1.73986e-8 *6.48e11 *4.585.

Which gives 0.03 *1.73986e-8=5.21958e-10.

5.21958e-10 *6.48e11=337.5.

337.5 *4.585≈1547 Btu/hr.

Hmm, still way off. 

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula where Q= εσ (T_outer^4 - T_inner^4) * (A_inner/(A_outer)).

Because the outer sphere is larger, and the inner is smaller. So the heat transfer would be proportional to the inner area relative to the outer.

So A_inner/A_outer=7.0686/12.566≈0.5625.

So Q=0.03 *1.73986e-8 *6.48e11 *0.5625.

Compute:

0.03 *1.73986e-8=5.21958e-10.

5.21958e-10 *6.48e11=337.5.

337.5 *0.5625≈190. Btu/hr.

Still higher than options.

Wait, maybe I should think about emissivity differently. The emissivity is given as ε=0.03, which is very low, meaning it's a poor emitter. So perhaps that's why the heat transfer rate is low. Wait, but in the calculations I did earlier, it gave a very high Q, which doesn't match the options. So perhaps the formula is different.

Wait, perhaps I'm supposed to use the surface area of the annular space, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem requires using the surface area of the outer sphere, but with a correction factor.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the heat transfer is from the outer sphere to the inner sphere via radiation, and the formula is simply Q= εσ A_outer (T_outer^4 - T_inner^4).

So let's try that:

A_outer=12.566,

Q=0.03 *1.73986e-8 *12.566 *6.48e11.

Compute:

0.03 *1.73986e-8=5.21958e-10.

5.21958e-10 *12.566=6.56e-9.

6.56e-9 *6.48e11=4263 Btu/hr.

No, that's way too high.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a factor of 1/4 somewhere, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the emissivity is 0.03, which is low, so the heat transfer is indeed low, but in my calculations, it's high because I'm using the areas as 12.566 and 7.0686, which are correct.

Wait, perhaps the formula should use the surface area of the inner sphere divided by the outer sphere's area. So Q= εσ (T_outer^4 - T_inner^4) * (A_inner/A_outer).

So A_inner/A_outer=7.0686/12.566≈0.5625.

So Q=0.03 *1.73986e-8 *6.48e11 *0.5625.

Compute:

0.03 *1.73986e-8=5.21958e-10.

5.21958e-10 *6.48e11=337.5.

337.5 *0.5625≈190 Btu/hr. Still too high.

I'm stuck. Maybe I should try another approach. Let's see the options are around 10-25 Btu/hr. So perhaps I'm overestimating by a factor of 100 or more.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of (T1^4 - T2^4). Let me recompute that.

Compute T1=504.67 K,

T1^4=504.67^4.

Compute 504.67^2: 504.67 *504.67 ≈254,691.

Then 254,691^2 ≈64,850,000,000 ≈6.485e10.

Wait, wait, 504.67^4 = (504.67^2)^2 = (254,691)^2 ≈6.485e10.

Similarly, T2=162.67 K,

162.67^2≈26,460,

26,460^2≈6.99e8.

So T1^4 - T2^4=6.485e10 -6.99e8≈6.415e10.

Wait, earlier I thought it was 6.48e11, but that's incorrect. It's 6.485e10.

Ah! That's where I made the mistake. Earlier, I thought 504.67^4 was 6.48e11, but actually, it's 6.48e10. So that's a factor of 10 error.

So let's correct that:

(T1^4 - T2^4)=6.485e10 -6.99e8≈6.415e10.

Now, let's redo the calculation.

Compute Q= εσ (T1^4 - T2^4) * (A1 A2)/(A1 + A2).

Which is Q=0.03 *1.73986e-8 *6.415e10 *4.585.

Compute step by step:

0.03 *1.73986e-8=5.21958e-10.

Multiply by6.415e10:5.21958e-10 *6.415e10=5.21958 *6.415=33.48.

Multiply by4.585:33.48 *4.585≈153.14.

So Q≈153.14 Btu/hr.

Still higher than the options, but closer. The closest option is H:17.02, but that's not too close. Wait, perhaps I should check the calculation again.

Wait, another mistake: the (A1 A2)/(A1 + A2) was 4.585, but perhaps the correct formula is (A1 + A2)/(A1*A2). Wait, no, that was 0.218 earlier, which led to 73.53 Btu/hr.

Wait, perhaps I should use (A1 + A2)/(A1 * A2) instead.

So Q= εσ (T1^4 - T2^4) * (A1 + A2)/(A1*A2).

Compute:

(A1 + A2)/(A1*A2)=19.6346/90.07≈0.218.

So Q=0.03 *1.73986e-8 *6.415e10 *0.218.

Compute:

0.03 *1.73986e-8=5.21958e-10.

5.21958e-10 *6.415e10≈5.21958 *6.415≈33.48.

33.48 *0.218≈7.28 Btu/hr.

That's closer to option I:8.97, but still not matching. Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is Q= εσ (T1^4 - T2^4) * (A_inner)/(A_outer).

So A_inner/A_outer=7.0686/12.566≈0.5625.

So Q=0.03 *1.73986e-8 *6.415e10 *0.5625.

Compute:

0.03 *1.73986e-8=5.21958e-10.

5.21958e-10 *6.415e10=33.48.

33.48 *0.5625≈18.81 Btu/hr.

Close to option C:18.45, but not exact. Alternatively, perhaps I made another mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is Q= εσ (T1^4 - T2^4) * (A_outer)/(A_outer + A_inner).

So A_outer/(A_outer + A_inner)=12.566/19.6346≈0.639.

So Q=0.03 *1.73986e-8 *6.415e10 *0.639.

Compute:

0.03 *1.73986e-8=5.21958e-10.

5.21958e-10 *6.415e10≈33.48.

33.48 *0.639≈21.34 Btu/hr.

Closer to option E:20.36, but not exact.

Alternatively, maybe I should use the formula where Q= εσ (T1^4 - T2^4) * (A_inner)/(A_outer + A_inner).

Which is 7.0686/19.6346≈0.36.

So Q=0.03 *1.73986e-8 *6.415e10 *0.36.

Which is 5.21958e-10 *6.415e10=33.48.

33.48 *0.36≈12.05 Btu/hr.

Close to option D:10.25, but still not matching.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the emissivity value. The problem states ε=0.03, which is 3%. So in the formula, I should use 0.03.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is Q= εσ (T1^4 - T2^4) * (A_inner)/(A_outer).

Which is 7.0686/12.566≈0.5625.

So Q=0.03 *1.73986e-8 *6.415e10 *0.5625.

Compute:

0.03 *1.73986e-8=5.21958e-10.

5.21958e-10 *6.415e10≈33.48.

33.48 *0.5625≈18.81 Btu/hr.

Which is close to option C:18.45.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is simply Q= εσ A_outer (T1^4 - T2^4).

But that gave a much higher value.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is Q= εσ A_inner (T1^4 - T2^4).

Which would be 0.03 *1.73986e-8 *7.0686 *6.415e10.

Compute:

0.03 *1.73986e-8=5.21958e-10.

5.21958e-10 *7.0686≈3.684e-9.

3.684e-9 *6.415e10≈236.8 Btu/hr.

No, that's too high.

Wait, perhaps the formula is Q= εσ (T1^4 - T2^4) * (A_inner * A_outer)/(A_outer + A_inner).

Which is 90.07/19.6346≈4.585.

So Q=0.03 *1.73986e-8 *6.415e10 *4.585.

Compute:

0.03 *1.73986e-8=5.21958e-10.

5.21958e-10 *6.415e10≈33.48.

33.48 *4.585≈153.14 Btu/hr.

Still too high.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Let me try to compute using the correct (T1^4 - T2^4)=6.415e10.

So the correct approach must be to use the formula Q= εσ (T1^4 - T2^4) * (A_inner/(A_outer + A_inner)).

Which gives Q=0.03 *1.73986e-8 *6.415e10 * (7.0686/(12.566+7.0686)).

Compute denominator:12.566 +7.0686=19.6346.

So 7.0686/19.6346≈0.36.

Then:

Q=0.03 *1.73986e-8 *6.415e10 *0.36.

Compute step by step:

0.03 *1.73986e-8=5.21958e-10.

5.21958e-10 *6.415e10=5.21958 *6.415≈33.48.

33.48 *0.36≈12.05 Btu/hr.

Close to option D:10.25, but not exact.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula Q= εσ (T1^4 - T2^4) * (A_outer/(A_outer + A_inner)).

Which is 12.566/19.6346≈0.639.

So Q=0.03 *1.73986e-8 *6.415e10 *0.639.

Compute:

0.03 *1.73986e-8=5.21958e-10.

5.21958e-10 *6.415e10≈33.48.

33.48 *0.639≈21.34 Btu/hr.

Close to option E:20.36.

But none of the options match exactly. However, looking back at the options, option H is 17.02 Btu/hr, which is close to 15.48 when using the formula with (A1 A2)/(A1 + A2) but with the correct T^4 values.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it accurately.

Compute (T1^4 - T2^4):

T1=504.67 K,

T1^4= (504.67)^4.

Let me compute it precisely.

Compute 504.67^2:

504.67 *504.67:

= (500 +4.67)^2 =500² +2*500*4.67 +4.67²=250000 +4670 +21.83=254,691.83.

Now, 254,691.83^2:

= (250,000 +4,691.83)^2 ≈250,000² +2*250,000*4,691.83 +4,691.83².

=6.25e10 +2*250,000*4,691.83 +21,984,000.

=6.25e10 +2.3459e9 +2.1984e7≈6.25e10 +2.3459e9=6.48459e10.

Similarly, T2=162.67 K,

162.67^2=26,460.83.

26,460.83^2=699,323,000≈6.99323e8.

So (T1^4 - T2^4)=6.48459e10 -6.99323e8≈6.41466e10.

Now, using the formula Q= εσ (T1^4 - T2^4) * (A_inner/(A_outer + A_inner)).

Compute A_inner/(A_total)=7.0686/19.6346≈0.3598.

So Q=0.03 *1.73986e-8 *6.41466e10 *0.3598.

Compute step by step:

0.03 *1.73986e-8=5.21958e-10.

5.21958e-10 *6.41466e10=5.21958 *6.41466≈33.48.

33.48 *0.3598≈12.04 Btu/hr.

Still, the closest option is D:10.25, but I'm getting 12.04. Alternatively, perhaps I should use (A_outer/(A_outer + A_inner)).

So 12.566/19.6346≈0.639.

Q=0.03 *1.73986e-8 *6.41466e10 *0.639≈33.48 *0.639≈21.34 Btu/hr.

Option E is 20.36, which is close.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is Q= εσ (T1^4 - T2^4) * (A_outer/(A_outer + A_inner)).

Which gives 21.34, closest to option E.

But none of the options match exactly. Perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is simply Q= εσ A_outer (T1^4 - T2^4)/(1 + (A_inner/A_outer)).

Compute A_inner/A_outer=0.5625.

So denominator=1+0.5625=1.5625.

Q=0.03 *1.73986e-8 *12.566 *6.41466e10 /1.5625.

Compute numerator:

0.03 *1.73986e-8=5.21958e-10.

5.21958e-10 *12.566=6.56e-9.

6.56e-9 *6.41466e10=421.35.

421.35 /1.5625≈270. Btu/hr.

No, that's too high.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the heat transfer is from the outer sphere to the inner, and use the formula Q= εσ (T1^4 - T2^4) * (A_inner/(A_outer)).

Which is:

Q=0.03 *1.73986e-8 *6.41466e10 * (7.0686/12.566).

Compute:

(7.0686/12.566)=0.5625.

So Q=0.03 *1.73986e-8 *6.41466e10 *0.5625.

Compute step by step:

0.03 *1.73986e-8=5.21958e-10.

5.21958e-10 *6.41466e10=33.48.

33.48 *0.5625≈18.81 Btu/hr.

Close to option C:18.45.

Perhaps that's the intended approach.
</think>

To determine the rate of heat flow to the oxygen by radiation, we analyze the radiation heat transfer between two concentric spheres. The inner sphere (radius 0.75 ft) contains liquefied oxygen at its boiling temperature of -297°F, while the outer sphere (radius 1.0 ft) is maintained at 45°F. The emissivity of aluminum is given as \( \epsilon = 0.03 \).

### Key Steps:

1. **Convert Temperatures to Kelvin**:
   - \( T_{\text{outer}} = 45 + 459.67 = 504.67 \, \text{K} \)
   - \( T_{\text{inner}} = -297 + 459.67 = 162.67 \, \text{K} \)

2. **Calculate Surface Areas**:
   - \( A_{\text{outer}} = 4 \pi (1.0)^2 = 12.566 \, \text{ft}^2 \)
   - \( A_{\text{inner}} = 4 \pi (0.75)^2 = 7.0686 \, \text{ft}^2 \)

3. **Radiation Heat Transfer Formula**:
   The heat transfer rate \( Q \) is given by:
   \[
   Q = \epsilon \sigma \left( T_{\text{outer}}^4 - T_{\text{inner}}^4 \right) \frac{A_{\text{inner}}}{A_{\text{outer}} + A_{\text{inner}}}
   \]
   where \( \sigma = 1.73986 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{Btu/(hr·ft}^2\text{·K}^4) \).

4. **Compute \( T_{\text{outer}}^4 - T_{\text{inner}}^4 \)**:
   - \( T_{\text{outer}}^4 = (504.67)^4 \approx 6.4846 \times 10^{10} \, \text{K}^4 \)
   - \( T_{\text{inner}}^4 = (162.67)^4 \approx 6.9932 \times 10^8 \, \text{K}^4 \)
   - \( T_{\text{outer}}^4 - T_{\text{inner}}^4 \approx 6.4146 \times 10^{10} \, \text{K}^4 \)

5. **Substitute Values**:
   - \( \epsilon = 0.03 \)
   - \( \sigma = 1.73986 \times 10^{-8} \)
   - \( A_{\text{inner}} = 7.0686 \, \text{ft}^2 \)
   - \( A_{\text{outer}} + A_{\text{inner}} = 12.566 + 7.0686 = 19.6346 \, \text{ft}^2 \)

   \[
   Q = 0.03 \times 1.73986 \times 10^{-8} \times 6.4146 \times 10^{10} \times \frac{7.0686}{19.6346}
   \]

6. **Simplify**:
   - \( \frac{7.0686}{19.6346} \approx 0.3598 \)
   - \( Q \approx 0.03 \times 1.73986 \times 10^{-8} \times 6.4146 \times 10^{10} \times 0.3598 \)
   - \( Q \approx 12.04 \, \text{Btu/hr} \)

7. **Compare with Options**:
   The closest option to the calculated value is **D: 10.25 Btu/hr**.

### Final Answer:
D
