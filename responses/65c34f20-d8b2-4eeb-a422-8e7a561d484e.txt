Okay, so I've got this question about production costs, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me read through it carefully.

The question says that the costs for producing one widget include materials, expenses, and labor. The specifics are:

- Materials: 2 parts at $25.00 per part.
- Expenses: $10.00
- Labor: 20 operations at $5.00 per operation.

So I think the first step is to calculate each component's cost and then the total cost per widget. Let me break it down.

Materials cost: 2 parts * $25 = $50.
Labor cost: 20 operations * $5 = $100.
Expenses: $10.

Adding those up: $50 (materials) + $100 (labor) + $10 (expenses) = $160 total cost per widget.

Now, looking at the options, each letter corresponds to a statement, and I need to see which is the only valid conclusion.

Option A says materials are low. Let's see: materials are $50, which is a third of the total. So they're not exactly low, but neither are they the majority. Hmm.

Option B says each widget requires $50 of labor. Wait, no, labor is 20 operations at $5 each, so that's $100, not $50. So B is incorrect.

Option C says expenses are the largest contributor. The expenses are $10, which is the smallest part. So that's not correct.

Option D says materials make up more than half. Materials are $50, total is $160. Half of $160 is $80, so $50 is less than half. So D is incorrect.

Option E says the total is less than $100. But total is $160, so E is wrong.

Option F says output is labor intensive. Since labor is $100, which is the largest part, the process is indeed labor-intensive. That might be a valid conclusion.

Option G says labor rates are excessive. Well, the question doesn't give any info about whether labor rates are high or low compared to industry standards. So we can't conclude that; it's just a fact.

Option H says minimal labor. But labor is the biggest cost, so H is wrong.

Option I says selling price should be $160. The question doesn't give any info about pricing strategy or profit margins, so we can't determine the selling price from the given data. So I is incorrect.

Option J says the majority is due to expenses. Expenses are only $10, so J is wrong.

Wait, so looking back, the total cost is $160. The labor is the largest part at $100, so the process is labor-intensive. So the correct conclusion would be that the output is labor intensive, which is option F, but looking at the options, option F is labeled as (C) output is labor intensive. Wait, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, the options are labeled A to J, each with a statement. Let me check the options again.

Looking back:

Options are:

A: (D) material costs are low
B: Each widget requires $50 of labor
C: (C) output is labor intensive
D: (D) materials make up more than half
E: (E) total cost less than $100
F: (C) output is labor intensive
Wait, no, I think I might have misread the options. Let me check again.

Wait, the user's message says:

Options:

A: (D) material costs are low
B: Each widget requires $50 of labor
C: (C) output is labor intensive
D: (D) materials make up more than half
E: (E) total production cost is less than $100 per widget
F: (C) output is labor intensive
G: (B) labor rates are excessive
H: The production process requires minimal labor
I: (A) The selling price should be $160 per widget
J: The majority of the production cost is due to expenses

Wait, no, looking back, the options are from A to J, each with a statement. So for example:

Option A is (D) material costs are low.

Wait, no, the way it's written is a bit unclear. Let me parse it correctly.

The user wrote:

Options:

A: (D) material costs are low
B: Each widget requires $50 of labor
C: (C) output is labor intensive
D: (D) materials make up more than half
E: (E) total production cost is less than $100 per widget
F: (C) output is labor intensive
G: (B) labor rates are excessive
H: The production process requires minimal labor
I: (A) The selling price should be $160 per widget
J: The majority of the production cost is due to expenses

Wait, perhaps each option is a letter (A to J), and each has a statement. For example:

Option A is statement (D): material costs are low.

But that's confusing because the statements themselves are labeled (A) through (J). No, actually, the question's options are labeled A to J, each corresponding to one of the statements.

Wait, perhaps the way it's structured is:

The question gives options A through J, each with a statement, such as:

A: The selling price should be $160 per widget.

B: Labor rates are excessive.

C: Output is labor intensive.

And so on.

But in the user's message, after the question, the options are listed as:

Options:

A: (D) material costs are low
B: Each widget requires $50 of labor
C: (C) output is labor intensive
D: (D) materials make up more than half
E: (E) total production cost is less than $100 per widget
F: (C) output is labor intensive
G: (B) labor rates are excessive
H: The production process requires minimal labor
I: (A) The selling price should be $160 per widget
J: The majority of the production cost is due to expenses

Wait, this seems a bit confusing. Let me clarify.

Actually, the options are labeled A to J, each with a statement. For example:

A: The selling price should be $160 per widget.

B: Labor rates are excessive.

C: Output is labor intensive.

D: Material costs are low.

E: Total production cost is less than $100 per widget.

F: Output is labor intensive.

G: Labor rates are excessive.

H: Minimal labor.

I: Selling price $160.

J: Majority due to expenses.

Wait, perhaps the correct way is that each option (A-J) is a statement. For example, option A is "The selling price should be $160 per widget." Option B is "Labor rates are excessive," etc.

But in the user's message, the options are listed as:

A: (D) material costs are low

B: Each widget requires $50 of labor

C: (C) output is labor intensive

D: (D) materials make up more than half

E: (E) total production cost is less than $100 per widget

F: (C) output is labor intensive

G: (B) labor rates are excessive

H: The production process requires minimal labor

I: (A) The selling price should be $160 per widget

J: The majority of the production cost is due to expenses

Wait, that seems inconsistent. Perhaps each option (A-J) is a statement, and the numbers in parentheses refer to the original options in the question.

Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in formatting, and the options are A-J, each corresponding to one of the possible conclusions, which are labeled (A) through (J) in the question.

Wait, perhaps the correct way is that the options are A-J, each being one of the possible conclusions from (A) to (J) in the question.

Wait, the question lists the possible conclusions as (A) to (J), but the options are labeled A to J, each with one of those statements.

Wait, perhaps the user intended that the options (A-J) correspond to the possible conclusions (A-J) in the question. For example:

In the question, the possible conclusions are:

(A) The selling price should be $160 per widget.

(B) labor rates are excessive

(C) output is labor intensive

(D) material costs are low

(E) The total production cost is less than $100 per widget

(F) (C) output is labor intensive

(G) (B) labor rates are excessive

(H) The production process requires minimal labor

(I) (A) The selling price should be $160 per widget

(J) The majority of the production cost is due to expenses

Wait, this is getting too confusing. Let me approach it differently.

The total cost per widget is $160. Now, looking at each possible conclusion:

(A) Selling price should be $160. Well, the total cost is $160, but the selling price would typically be higher to make a profit. The question doesn't mention profit, so we can't conclude the selling price is $160. So A is incorrect.

(B) Labor rates are excessive. There's no info on whether $5 per operation is high or low. So we can't conclude this.

(C) Output is labor intensive. Since labor is the largest cost component, yes, the process is labor-intensive. So C is correct.

(D) Material costs are low. Materials are $50, which is a third of the total. Not low, but not the majority either. So D is incorrect.

(E) Total cost less than $100. No, it's $160, so E is wrong.

(F) Output is labor intensive. Same as C, correct.

(G) Labor rates excessive. As before, no info.

(H) Minimal labor. No, labor is the main cost.

(I) Selling price $160. Same as A, can't conclude.

(J) Majority due to expenses. Expenses are $10, so no.

Wait, but in the options provided, the user lists options A-J, each with a statement. For example, option A is (D) material costs are low, which refers to the conclusion (D) in the question. Option C is (C) output is labor intensive, which is conclusion C in the question. So, in the options, A-J each correspond to a conclusion in the question's list.

So the question is asking which of the options A-J is the only valid conclusion. Each option A-J is a possible conclusion, and the correct one is the valid one.

From the calculations:

- Total cost is $160.
- Labor is $100, materials $50, expenses $10.

So the largest component is labor, meaning the process is labor-intensive. Therefore, the valid conclusion is (C) output is labor intensive.

Looking at the options, which option corresponds to (C)? Let's check:

Options:

A: (D) material costs are low → incorrect.

B: $50 labor → wrong, it's $100.

C: (C) output is labor intensive → correct.

D: (D) materials make up more than half → no, 50 is less than half of 160.

E: $100 total → no, it's $160.

F: (C) output is labor intensive → same as C.

Wait, but in the options listed by the user, options C and F both say (C) output is labor intensive. That can't be right. Perhaps it's a typo.

Assuming that each option is unique, then the correct answer is option C or F, whichever corresponds to conclusion (C).

But the way the options are presented, perhaps option C is (C) output is labor intensive, and F is also (C). That seems off. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended that option C is (C), and F is another option.

Wait, perhaps the options are as follows:

A: (D) material costs are low

B: Each widget requires $50 of labor

C: (C) output is labor intensive

D: (D) materials make up more than half

E: (E) total production cost is less than $100 per widget

F: (C) output is labor intensive

G: (B) labor rates are excessive

H: The production process requires minimal labor

I: (A) The selling price should be $160 per widget

J: The majority of the production cost is due to expenses

Wait, this seems to have options C and F both stating (C), which is confusing. So perhaps the correct answer is either C or F, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the options are mislabeled, and only one option correctly states that output is labor intensive.

So, the correct conclusion is (C) output is labor intensive, so the correct option is either C or F. But since both are same, perhaps it's a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is C.

Wait, in the user's message, the options are:

A: (D) material costs are low

B: Each widget requires $50 of labor

C: (C) output is labor intensive

D: (D) materials make up more than half

E: (E) total production cost is less than $100 per widget

F: (C) output is labor intensive

G: (B) labor rates are excessive

H: The production process requires minimal labor

I: (A) The selling price should be $160 per widget

J: The majority of the production cost is due to expenses

So both C and F are same, which is (C) output is labor intensive.

But that can't be right. Perhaps it's a typo, and one of them is supposed to be different.

Assuming that the correct answer is (C), then the options would be either C or F, but since they are same, perhaps the intended answer is C.

But in the options, perhaps option C is (C), and F is another option. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C, which is (C) output is labor intensive.
</think>

The total cost per widget is $160, with labor being the largest component at $100. This makes the process labor-intensive. Therefore, the correct conclusion is that output is labor-intensive.

Answer: C
