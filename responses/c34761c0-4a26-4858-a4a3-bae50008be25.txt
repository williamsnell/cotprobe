Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this problem about the distance between two planes in a close-packed layer of spheres. All the spheres have a radius of 0.200 nm. The question is asking for the distance between a plane passing through the centers of one layer and the plane of an adjacent layer.

Hmm, I remember that close-packing of spheres usually refers to either hexagonal close packing (HCP) or face-centered cubic (FCC) packing. But I think in both cases, the arrangement of layers is such that each layer is directly above the previous one in a certain way. Wait, no, actually in HCP, the layers are arranged in an ABAB... sequence, while FCC is ABCABC... So each layer in HCP is directly above a layer two steps away, but adjacent layers are offset.

But wait, the question is about the distance between two adjacent layers. So in HCP, each layer is a certain distance apart. I think the key here is to figure out the vertical distance between these planes.

Let me visualize the close-packing. Each layer is a hexagonal arrangement. The spheres in one layer fit into the gaps of the layer below. So, the centers of the spheres in adjacent layers are positioned above the triangular voids of the previous layer.

I think the vertical distance can be found using some trigonometry. The centers of the spheres form a tetrahedron when considering two adjacent layers. Each sphere has a radius of 0.200 nm, so the diameter is 0.400 nm.

Wait, no, the diameter is 2*r, which is 0.400 nm. But how does that help? Oh, right, when spheres are in contact, the centers are separated by the diameter. But in the case of adjacent layers, the spheres are in contact diagonally across the layers, not directly above each other.

So imagine two spheres in adjacent layers; their centers are separated by the diameter, which is 0.400 nm. But the vertical component of this separation is the distance between the two planes we're trying to find.

Let me think about the arrangement. In a hexagonal close-packed structure, each sphere in the upper layer sits above a trio of spheres in the lower layer. The centers form a regular tetrahedron, perhaps? Wait, maybe it's a different shape. Alternatively, the vertical distance can be found using the Pythagorean theorem.

Consider the horizontal distance between the centers of two spheres in adjacent layers. Since the spheres are arranged in a hexagonal lattice, the horizontal offset is such that the centers form a triangle. The horizontal distance between centers in adjacent layers might be equal to the radius, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the vertical distance is the height of a tetrahedron with edge length equal to the diameter of the spheres. Because the centers of three spheres in the lower layer form an equilateral triangle, and the upper sphere's center is directly above the centroid of that triangle.

The edge length of that triangle would be twice the radius, which is 0.400 nm, because each sphere touches its neighbor. So the base of the tetrahedron is an equilateral triangle with side length 0.400 nm.

The height (h) of a regular tetrahedron with edge length a is given by h = sqrt(2/3) * a. Wait, no, let me check: the formula for the height of a regular tetrahedron is sqrt(6)/3 * a.

Let me compute that. a is 0.400 nm. So h = sqrt(6)/3 * 0.400.

Calculating sqrt(6) is approximately 2.4495. So 2.4495 /3 is about 0.8165. Multiply by 0.400 nm, which gives 0.8165 * 0.400 ≈ 0.3266 nm. Wait, that's about 0.327 nm, which is one of the options, option F.

But wait, does that make sense? The vertical distance between layers is about 0.327 nm. Let me think again.

Alternatively, maybe I should think in terms of the unit cell. In an HCP structure, the unit cell is a hexagonal prism. The height (c) of the unit cell can be found using the relation that the atomic packing factor (APF) is 0.74.

But perhaps a simpler approach is to consider the distance between the two planes. Each plane is a layer of sphere centers. The vertical distance between these layers is the height of the tetrahedron as I thought before, which gives 0.327 nm.

Wait another thought: In close-packing, the distance between layers is often expressed in terms of the radius. For a close-packed structure, the interlayer spacing (d) can be calculated using the formula d = (2 * sqrt(6)/3) * r. Let's compute that.

r is 0.200 nm. So d = 2 * (2.4495 / 3) * 0.200.

Wait, 2*sqrt(6)/3 is approximately 1.63299. Multiply by r (0.200): 1.63299 * 0.200 ≈ 0.3266 nm, which is approximately 0.327 nm.

So the correct answer should be option F: 0.327 nm.

The problem involves finding the vertical distance between two adjacent close-packed layers of spheres, each with a radius of 0.200 nm. In a hexagonal close-packed (HCP) structure, the centers of the spheres in adjacent layers form a regular tetrahedron with edge length equal to twice the radius (0.400 nm). The height of this tetrahedron, which corresponds to the vertical distance between the layers, is calculated using the formula:

\[
d = \frac{\sqrt{6}}{3} \times a
\]

where \(a = 0.400 \, \text{nm}\). Substituting the values:

\[
d = \frac{\sqrt{6}}{3} \times 0.400 \approx 0.327 \, \text{nm}.
\]

This matches option F.
