Okay, so I've got this calculus problem here, and I need to figure out when the curve defined by the equation x³ + xy - y² = 10 has a vertical tangent line. Hmm, vertical tangent lines occur where the derivative dy/dx is undefined, right? That usually happens when the denominator of dy/dx is zero after implicit differentiation. 

Alright, let's start by differentiating both sides of the equation with respect to x. The equation is x³ + xy - y² = 10. So, taking the derivative term by term:

The derivative of x³ is 3x². 

Then, for the term xy, I'll use the product rule. The derivative of x is 1, so that's 1*y + x*(dy/dx). So that gives y + x dy/dx.

Next, the term -y². The derivative of y² is 2y*(dy/dx), so with the negative sign it becomes -2y dy/dx.

The derivative of the right side, 10, is 0.

Putting it all together, the equation becomes:

3x² + y + x dy/dx - 2y dy/dx = 0.

Now, I need to solve for dy/dx. Let's collect the terms with dy/dx:

x dy/dx - 2y dy/dx = -3x² - y.

Factor out dy/dx:

dy/dx (x - 2y) = -3x² - y.

So, dy/dx = (-3x² - y)/(x - 2y).

A vertical tangent occurs when the denominator is zero because that makes dy/dx undefined. So, set the denominator equal to zero:

x - 2y = 0 → x = 2y.

So, at points where x = 2y, the curve has a vertical tangent. Now, I need to find the x-values where this happens. So, substitute x = 2y into the original equation to find the corresponding x and y.

Original equation: x³ + x y - y² = 10.

Substituting x = 2y:

(2y)³ + (2y)(y) - y² = 10.

Let's compute each term:

(2y)³ = 8y³,

(2y)(y) = 2y²,

So, putting it together:

8y³ + 2y² - y² = 10 → 8y³ + y² = 10.

That simplifies to 8y³ + y² - 10 = 0.

Hmm, now I have a cubic equation in terms of y: 8y³ + y² - 10 = 0. I need to solve for y here. Let me think about possible real roots. Maybe I can try rational root theorem. Possible rational roots are factors of 10 over factors of 8, so ±1, ±2, ±5, ±10, ±1/2, etc.

Testing y=1: 8(1)^3 + (1)^2 -10 = 8 +1 -10= -1 ≠0.

y=2: 8*8 +4 -10=64+4-10=58≠0.

y= -1: -8 +1 -10=-17≠0.

y=1/2: 8*(1/8) + (1/4) -10=1 +0.25 -10= -8.75≠0.

y=5/2: 8*(125/8) + (25/4) -10=125 +6.25 -10=121.25≠0.

Hmm, maybe y is not a simple fraction. Perhaps I need to use numerical methods or graphing to approximate.

Alternatively, maybe I can factor this or use substitution. Let me try to write the equation as:

8y³ + y² = 10.

Let me let z = y, so equation is 8z³ + z² -10=0.

Looking for real roots. Let's try y=1.2: 8*(1.728)+ (1.44) = 13.824 +1.44=15.264>10.

y=1: gives -1, as before.

y=1.1: 8*(1.331)=10.648, plus (1.21)=11.859, which is more than 10.

Wait, that's 8*(1.1)^3=8*(1.331)=10.648, plus (1.1)^2=1.21. So total is 10.648 +1.21=11.858, which is greater than 10. So between y=1 and y=1.1, the function goes from -1 to 11.858, so there's a root between 1 and 1.1.

Wait, but earlier at y=1, 8*(1) +1 =9, which is 9-10=-1. At y=1.2, it's 8*(1.728)=13.824 +1.44=15.264-10=5.264>0.

So root between 1 and 1.2.

Let me try y=1.05:

8*(1.05)^3 =8*(1.157625)=9.261, plus (1.05)^2=1.1025, total 9.261+1.1025=10.3635, which is 10.3635-10=0.3635>0.

So between y=1 and y=1.05, the function crosses zero.

At y=1, it's -1.

At y=1.025:

Compute 8*(1.025)^3 + (1.025)^2.

First, 1.025^3 ≈ 1.0771875.

8*1.0771875 ≈8.6175.

1.025^2≈1.050625.

Total: 8.6175 +1.050625≈9.668125.

So 9.668125-10= -0.331875 <0.

So between y=1.025 and y=1.05, function goes from -0.331875 to +0.3635. Let's try y=1.0375:

y=1.0375.

Compute y^3: (1.0375)^3.

1.0375^2 = approx 1.07665.

1.07665 *1.0375 ≈ 1.07665 *1.0375 ≈ let's compute:

1.07665 *1 =1.07665,

1.07665 *0.0375= approx 0.04038.

Total y³≈1.11703.

8*y³≈8*(1.11703)=8.93624.

y²= (1.0375)^2≈1.07665.

So 8y³ + y²≈8.93624 +1.07665≈10.01289, which is 10.01289-10≈0.01289>0.

So at y=1.0375, it's approximately 0.01289>0.

So the root is between 1.025 and 1.0375.

Wait, at y=1.0375, it's about 0.01289.

At y=1.0375-Δ, it's negative. Let me try y=1.035:

Compute y=1.035.

y^2 = (1.035)^2 ≈1.071225.

y^3 = y^2 * y ≈1.071225 *1.035 ≈1.1086.

8y³≈8*1.1086≈8.8688.

y²=1.071225.

So total: 8.8688 +1.071225≈9.940025, which is 9.940025-10≈-0.059975 <0.

So between y=1.035 and y=1.0375, function goes from -0.059975 to +0.01289. Let's do a linear approximation.

The change in y is 0.0025 (from 1.035 to 1.0375), and the function changes from -0.059975 to +0.01289, which is a change of about 0.072865.

We want to find where f(y)=0.

At y=1.035, f(y)= -0.059975.

We need to cover 0.059975 to reach zero. The rate is 0.072865 per 0.0025 y.

So, delta y needed is (0.059975 / 0.072865) *0.0025 ≈ approx 0.0025*(0.059975/0.072865).

Compute 0.059975/0.072865 ≈0.822.

So delta y ≈0.822 *0.0025≈0.002055.

So approximate root at y≈1.035 +0.002055≈1.037055.

So y≈1.037.

So x=2y≈2*(1.037)=2.074.

Looking at the options, option A is 2.074, which matches.

Wait, but let me check if there might be another solution. Cubic equations can have up to three real roots.

Let me check y negative. Let's try y=-1:

8*(-1)^3 + (-1)^2 -10 = -8 +1 -10= -17≠0.

y=-2: 8*(-8) +4 -10= -64+4-10=-70≠0.

How about y=0: 0 +0 -10=-10≠0.

Maybe another positive y beyond 1.037?

Wait, but let's see: 8y³ + y² -10=0.

As y increases beyond 1.037, the function 8y³ + y² -10 would keep increasing because the leading term is 8y³, which dominates for large y. So after y=1.037, it's positive and increasing, so no more roots there.

What about for y less than 1.037? The function crosses zero only once in the positive y region. So x=2y≈2.074, which is option A.

Alternatively, let me check if there's a negative solution. Suppose y is negative.

Let me plug y = -a, where a is positive.

Equation becomes 8*(-a)^3 + (-a)^2 -10= -8a³ +a² -10=0 → -8a³ +a² -10=0 → 8a³ -a² +10=0.

Looking for positive a. Let's test a=1: 8 -1 +10=17>0.

a=0.5: 8*(0.125)=1, 0.25, so 1 -0.25 +10=10.75>0.

a=0: 0 +0 +10=10>0.

a=2: 8*8=64 -4 +10=70>0.

So 8a³ -a² +10 is always positive for a>0, so no negative roots. Thus, only one real root at y≈1.037, x≈2.074.

So the answer should be A: 2.074.
</think>

The curve defined by \( x^3 + xy - y^2 = 10 \) has a vertical tangent line when the derivative \( \frac{dy}{dx} \) is undefined, which occurs when the denominator of the derivative equals zero. After implicit differentiation and solving, we find that this happens when \( x = 2y \). Substituting \( x = 2y \) into the original equation leads to the cubic equation \( 8y^3 + y^2 - 10 = 0 \). Numerical methods approximate the real root at \( y \approx 1.037 \), giving \( x \approx 2.074 \). This matches option A.

Answer: A
