Okay, so I have this question about Christopher Heath Wellman's position on immigration. I'm a bit rusty on my political philosophy, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that Wellman is a philosopher who has written about immigration and borders. I think he's known for defending certain positions on whether states have the right to control immigration.

Looking at the options, I need to pick which one aligns with his views. Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A says nation-states have a presumptive right to close their borders to all potential immigrants. I think Wellman does argue in favor of some rights for states regarding borders, but I'm not sure if it's a presumptive right to close them entirely or just to control.

Option B talks about an obligation to close borders to protect citizens. That sounds more like a justification for closing, but I'm not sure if Wellman frames it as an obligation rather than a right.

Option C claims closing borders is inherently racist. I don't think Wellman would agree with that. He's more about the state's sovereignty and rights rather than accusing policies of being racist.

Option D says anti-egalitarianism is incompatible with liberal cosmopolitanism. Wellman's work often deals with the tension between state sovereignty and cosmopolitanism. He might argue that states can have legitimate reasons to restrict immigration without being anti-egalitarian.

Option E is the opposite of D, saying anti-egalitarianism is compatible. I don't think that's Wellman's stance. He's more about reconciling state sovereignty with cosmopolitan values.

Option F suggests an obligation to open borders for the least well-off. That sounds more like a cosmopolitan view, maybe from someone like Joseph Carens, who argues for opening borders to help the global poor. I don't think Wellman supports an obligation to open for the least well-off; he's more about state rights.

Option G is about all borders being open with no restrictions. That's a very strong position, and I don't recall Wellman supporting that. He's more moderate, allowing some control.

Option H suggests abolishing nation-states for a global government. That's a more anarchist or globalist view, which I don't think Wellman supports. He's more about the rights of existing states.

Option I claims potential immigrants have a presumptive right to cross borders. This would be a strong cosmopolitan position, but I think Wellman argues against this, supporting state sovereignty instead.

Option J says states should prioritize their citizens over immigrants. That seems plausible. Wellman might argue that states can and should prioritize their own citizens' needs, but I'm not certain if that's his exact position.

Wait, I think I remember Wellman defending the idea that states have a right to control their borders, but not necessarily an obligation to close them. He might argue that states can have legitimate reasons to restrict immigration, but it's not an obligation to close borders entirely. So looking back, option A says they have a presumptive right to close borders, while option J talks about prioritizing citizens.

I think Wellman's position is more about the rights of states to control borders, not necessarily an obligation to close them. So option A might be closer. Alternatively, option J is about prioritizing citizens, which is a different angle.

Wait, in one of his articles, Wellman defends the right of states to restrict immigration based on the idea that states have a right to determine who can be a member, similar to a family's right to choose members. So he supports the right to close borders, making option A correct.

The correct answer is A: nation-states have a presumptive right to close their borders to all potential immigrants. Wellman defends the idea that states have a right to control their borders, emphasizing sovereignty and the analogy to private associations choosing their members.

Answer: A
