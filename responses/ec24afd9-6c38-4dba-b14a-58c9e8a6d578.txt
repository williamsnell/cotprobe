Alright, I'm trying to figure out what personal (ratione personae) immunity means. I remember from my law studies that there are different types of immunity, and personal immunity is one of them. Let me break it down.

So, personal immunity is based on the person's status or position, right? It's not about the act they committed. That means even if the person does something wrong, their personal immunity might protect them. Wait, but I think this is different from other immunities like functional or official immunity. 

Looking at the options:

A: Personal immunity is for private conduct, not public. Hmm, that doesn't sound right because personal immunity is more about the person's status, not the conduct itself.

B: Afforded to all physical persons. That seems too broad. Not everyone would have personal immunity, especially if they're not in a certain role.

C: All State officials regardless of conduct. No, because personal immunity shouldn't protect someone if they commit a crime. It's about the person's status, but if they misuse it, maybe it doesn't apply.

D: Only individuals who committed a crime in public. I don't think so. Personal immunity isn't about the nature of the act, but the person's status.

E: Particular persons irrespective of conduct. Maybe, but I'm not sure. It says irrespective, so whether they acted in public or private.

F: All individuals regardless of conduct. That can't be right because not everyone has personal immunity.

G: Afforded in personal capacity, not State conduct. This sounds closer. Personal immunity is for the individual's personal acts, not the State's actions.

H: State officials for public conduct. That might be official or functional immunity, not personal.

I: State officials for private conduct. Maybe, but personal immunity is about their personal status, so perhaps it covers both, but I'm not certain.

J: Particular persons if conduct was public. Again, seems more like functional immunity.

Wait, personal immunity (ratione personae) is about the person's status, so it applies regardless of whether they acted in public or private. So, if a State official does something in their private capacity, their personal immunity might still apply. But I'm a bit confused between options E and G.

Option E says it's afforded to particular persons irrespective of their conduct, whether public or private. That sounds like personal immunity because it's based on who the person is, not what they did.

Option G says it's in personal capacity and doesn't cover State conduct. That might mean it's about individual acts and not the State's actions, but I'm not sure if that's the definition.

Wait, personal immunity is about the person's identity. So, for example, a head of state might have personal immunity, which applies to their person regardless of whether they were acting officially or not. So it's not about the conduct's capacity but the person's status.

So, looking again: Option E says it's given to particular persons irrespective of their conduct's capacity. That fits because it's about the person, not the act.

Alternatively, Option H and J talk about public conduct, which might be more about official acts, so probably not personal immunity.

So I think the correct answer is E. But I'm a bit torn between E and G. Let me double-check. Personal immunity is about the person's status, so it applies irrespective of whether they acted in public or private. So E makes sense.

The correct answer is **E**. Personal (ratione personae) immunity is afforded to particular persons irrespective of whether their conduct was undertaken in a private or public capacity. This type of immunity is based on the individual's status or position, not the nature of their conduct. 

Answer: E
