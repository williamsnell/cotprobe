Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. The question is asking about the work done by a perfect gas during an adiabatic frictionless process when its temperature changes from 200°F to 300°F. The molecular weight is given as 34.0, and the specific heat at constant pressure, Cp, is provided by the expression Cp = 0.212 + 0.000059T. The options are from A to J, and I need to pick the correct one.

First, I remember that in thermodynamics, work done by the gas during a process can be calculated using the first law of thermodynamics, which is ΔU = Q - W, where ΔU is the change in internal energy, Q is the heat added to the system, and W is the work done by the system. But wait, the process here is adiabatic, right? So in an adiabatic process, there's no heat exchange with the surroundings, which means Q = 0. That simplifies things a bit because then ΔU = -W. So the work done W would be equal to -ΔU.

But wait, another thought: for an adiabatic process, the work done can also be expressed using the change in internal energy. Alternatively, since the process is adiabatic and frictionless, it's also a reversible process, so maybe I can use the relation involving the specific heat and the temperature change.

Hold on, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. For an ideal gas undergoing an adiabatic process, the work done is related to the change in internal energy. The internal energy change ΔU can be calculated using the specific heat at constant volume, Cv. But wait, the problem gives me Cp, not Cv. Hmm, so maybe I need to find Cv first.

I recall that for an ideal gas, Cp = Cv + R, where R is the gas constant. But wait, R is usually expressed per mole, so I need to be careful with units. The molecular weight is given as 34.0, so I can calculate R per unit mass.

Wait, let me make sure. The gas constant R is 8.314 J/mol·K or in Btu units, it's approximately 0.001889 Btu/lbm·°R. Wait, no, wait. Actually, R in Btu is 53.352 ft·lbf/mol·°R, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to convert everything to consistent units.

Wait, maybe I should start by calculating the specific heat at constant volume, Cv. Since Cp = Cv + R, then Cv = Cp - R. But I need R in Btu per lbm per degree Fahrenheit because the temperature is given in °F. Or wait, because the temperature change is in °F, but in thermodynamics, we usually use absolute temperature in Kelvin or Rankine. Wait, but for temperature changes, the size of the degree in Fahrenheit is the same as in Celsius, but the scale is different. So when calculating ΔT, it's the same whether in °F or °C, but for absolute temperature, we need to use Rankine or Kelvin.

Hmm, so the temperature change here is from 200°F to 300°F, so ΔT = 100°F. Since the change is the same in °F and °C, but when calculating properties, I have to be careful about the units.

Wait, but the specific heat Cp is given as a function of temperature in °F. So I can use that directly. So first, I need to find Cv, which is Cp minus R. But R is the gas constant per mole. Since the molecular weight is given, I can find R per unit mass.

The molecular weight M is 34.0 lbm/mol. So R per unit mass would be R = 8.314 J/mol·K divided by M, but wait, I'm not sure about the exact value. Alternatively, R is often given as 53.352 ft·lbf/mol·°R, but that's more for engineering units. Alternatively, in Btu, R is approximately 0.001889 Btu/lbm·°R.

Wait, let me check. The universal gas constant R is 8.314 kJ/mol·K. To convert to Btu, since 1 kJ ≈ 0.00094778 Btu, so R ≈ 8.314 * 0.00094778 ≈ 0.00789 Btu/mol·K. But wait, that's per mole. So per lbm, since the molecular weight is 34 lbm/mol, R per lbm would be R = 0.00789 Btu/mol·K / (34 lbm/mol) ≈ 0.000232 Btu/lbm·K.

Wait, but temperature is in °F, so I need to convert to Rankine. The conversion is T(R) = T(°F) + 459.67. But since we're dealing with a temperature change, ΔT in °F is the same as ΔT in Rankine. So for ΔT = 100°F, it's 100 degrees in both scales.

Wait, but when calculating Cv, which is Cp - R, and since Cp is given as a function of T in °F, I need to make sure that R is in the same units as Cp. Cp is given in Btu/lbm, I think, because the options are in Btu/lb. So, yes, I need R in Btu/lbm per °F.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, Cp is given as Cp = 0.212 + 0.000059 T, where T is in °F. So Cp has units of Btu/lbm·°F, perhaps? Or is it Btu/lbm? Wait, let's think about how Cp is defined. Specific heat at constant pressure, Cp, is the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of a unit mass of gas by one degree Fahrenheit at constant pressure. So the units would be Btu/lbm·°F.

Wait, but the problem says Cp is given by that expression, so I think it's in Btu/lbm·°F. Hmm, but when we calculate ΔU, which is the change in internal energy, the formula is ΔU = m * Cv * ΔT, where Cv is in Btu/lbm·°F, and ΔT is in °F, so the units would be Btu/lb.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to structure this.

Given:

- Process: adiabatic and frictionless (so Q=0 and it's a reversible process)
- T1 = 200°F, T2 = 300°F
- Molecular weight, M = 34.0 lbm/mol
- Cp(T) = 0.212 + 0.000059 T, where T is in °F

We need to find the work done by the gas, W.

Since the process is adiabatic, Q=0, so ΔU = -W. So W = -ΔU.

ΔU can be calculated using the specific heat at constant volume, Cv. For an ideal gas, Cv = Cp - R. But R is the gas constant per unit mass.

So first, I need to find R in Btu/lbm·°F.

Wait, R is 8.314 J/mol·K. To convert to Btu/lbm·°F, let's see:

First, convert R to Btu/mol·°F. Since 1 K = 1 °C, and ΔT in °C is same as ΔT in K for changes. But for °F, 1 °F change is 0.5556 °C. So, R in Btu/mol·°F would be R = 8.314 J/mol·K * (1 Btu/1055.586 J) * (1 K/1.8 °F) = 8.314 / 1055.586 / 1.8 ≈ 8.314 / 1899.056 ≈ 0.00436 Btu/mol·°F.

Now, since molecular weight M is 34 lbm/mol, R per lbm is R = 0.00436 Btu/mol·°F / 34 lbm/mol ≈ 0.000128 Btu/lbm·°F.

So Cv = Cp - R = (0.212 + 0.000059 T) - 0.000128 Btu/lbm·°F.

Wait, but this would make Cv a function of temperature as well. Hmm, that complicates things because I can't just take an average or use a constant value. Alternatively, maybe I can approximate Cv as Cp - R, but since Cp varies with temperature, perhaps I need to integrate over the temperature change.

Wait, because Cp is a function of temperature, the specific heat isn't constant, so the internal energy change can't be calculated using a simple ΔU = m * Cv_avg * ΔT. Instead, I might need to integrate the specific heat at constant volume over the temperature change.

Alternatively, another approach: for an ideal gas, the change in internal energy depends only on temperature, and can be calculated using the integral of Cv dT. Since Cv = Cp - R, and Cp is given as a function of T, we can express Cv as Cp(T) - R.

So, ΔU = ∫ m * Cv dT from T1 to T2.

But since m (mass) is not given, perhaps the answer is expressed per unit mass. Let's assume m = 1 lbm for simplicity, so the work done would be W = -ΔU = - ∫ (Cp - R) dT from T1 to T2.

So, W = - ∫ (Cp - R) dT from 200°F to 300°F.

Substituting Cp = 0.212 + 0.000059 T,

W = - ∫ [(0.212 + 0.000059 T) - R] dT from 200 to 300.

We can compute this integral.

First, let's compute the integral ∫ (0.212 + 0.000059 T - R) dT from 200 to 300.

The integral becomes:

∫ (from 200 to 300) 0.212 dT + ∫ (from 200 to 300) 0.000059 T dT - ∫ (from 200 to 300) R dT.

Since R is a constant, the integral is:

0.212*(300 - 200) + 0.000059 * [ (300^2 - 200^2)/2 ] - R*(300 - 200).

Calculating each term:

First term: 0.212 * 100 = 21.2 Btu/lbm.

Second term: 0.000059 * (90000 - 40000)/2 = 0.000059 * (50000)/2 = 0.000059 * 25000 = 1.475 Btu/lbm.

Third term: R = 0.000128 Btu/lbm·°F, so R * 100 = 0.000128 * 100 = 0.0128 Btu/lbm.

So putting it all together:

21.2 + 1.475 - 0.0128 = 22.6622 Btu/lbm.

Then, W = -22.6622 Btu/lbm.

Wait, but looking at the options, the closest is option A: -19.55, B: -25.47, etc. Hmm, 22.66 isn't matching any option. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated R. Let me double-check the value of R per lbm·°F.

Earlier, I calculated R as 0.000128 Btu/lbm·°F. Let me verify that.

R is 8.314 J/mol·K. To convert to Btu/lbm·°F:

1 J = 0.00094778 Btu.

So 8.314 J/mol·K = 8.314 * 0.00094778 Btu/mol·K ≈ 0.00789 Btu/mol·K.

Since 1 K = 1.8 °F, so 0.00789 Btu/mol·K = 0.00789 / 1.8 ≈ 0.004383 Btu/mol·°F.

Now, molecular weight M = 34 lbm/mol, so R per lbm is 0.004383 / 34 ≈ 0.0001289 Btu/lbm·°F.

So that part seems correct.

Wait, but when calculating the integral, perhaps I should have considered that Cp is given per unit mass, so the integral would be per unit mass. So the work done per unit mass is W = - [21.2 + 1.475 - 0.0128] = -22.6622 Btu/lb.

But none of the options match that. The options are A: -19.55, B: -25.47, etc. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait another thought: maybe I should have used Cp and the relation for work in an adiabatic process. Wait, for an adiabatic process, the work done can also be calculated using W = m Cp (T1 - T2) / (γ - 1), but that's for constant specific heats. Since in this case, Cp is varying with temperature, that formula might not apply. So integrating is the correct approach.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the sign. Since the gas is expanding, it's doing work, so W should be negative if the system is losing energy. Wait, no, in thermodynamics, work done by the system is positive, but in the first law ΔU = Q - W, so if W is work done by the system, then for an expansion, W is positive, and ΔU would be negative if the process is adiabatic (since Q=0). Wait, but I'm not sure about the sign conventions here. Let me clarify.

In the first law, ΔU = Q - W, where W is work done by the system. So if the system does work (expands), W is positive, and ΔU is negative if Q=0, which is the case here. So W would be positive, but since the problem asks for work done by the gas, the answer should be positive. However, looking at the options, many are negative. Hmm, perhaps I got the sign wrong in the integral.

Wait, in the integral, I have W = -ΔU = - [ ∫ (Cp - R) dT ].

Wait, but let's think again: ΔU = ∫ m Cv dT = ∫ m (Cp - R) dT.

Since the process is adiabatic, W = -ΔU.

So W = - ∫ m (Cp - R) dT.

But if the temperature increases from 200 to 300, and the gas is doing work, then W should be positive. Wait, but the answer I got was negative, which would imply the system is losing energy, but if temperature increases, the internal energy increases, so the system must have done work, hence W should be positive. But in my calculation, W came out as negative. That suggests I might have an error in the sign.

Wait, perhaps I should have taken W = ΔU, not -ΔU. Let me clarify.

From the first law: ΔU = Q - W, where W is work done by the system. Since Q=0, ΔU = -W. So W = -ΔU.

But if the internal energy increases (from T1 to T2, which is higher), ΔU is positive. So W would be negative, which would imply that the system is losing energy, which can't be right because if the gas is expanding and doing work, W should be positive. Hmm, this is confusing.

Wait, perhaps I have the sign convention wrong. Let me double-check.

In the first law:

ΔU = Q + W, where W is work done on the system. So if the system does work (expands), W is negative, so ΔU = Q - |W|. Since Q=0, ΔU = -W, so W = -ΔU.

So if ΔU is positive (temperature increases), W is negative, meaning the system has done work and lost energy. So my earlier calculation of W = -22.66 Btu/lb would imply that the work done by the gas is 22.66 Btu/lb, but the negative sign suggests that the internal energy decreased, which contradicts the temperature increase. Wait, that doesn't make sense. So perhaps I made a mistake in the sign.

Wait, no. If the gas undergoes an adiabatic expansion, it does work on the surroundings, so W is positive, and since Q=0, ΔU = -W, so ΔU is negative. But in our case, the temperature increases, so ΔU is positive, which would require W to be negative, meaning the surroundings did work on the gas, which isn't the case here. So perhaps I'm getting confused with the process.

Wait, perhaps the process is compression, not expansion. If the temperature increases from 200 to 300°F, and the process is adiabatic, the gas is being compressed, so work is done on the gas, making W negative (since W is work done by the gas). Hmm, but that depends on the process. Wait, in an adiabatic process, if the gas is compressed, the temperature increases because work is done on it, and since Q=0, the internal energy increases.

Wait, but in the problem, it's stated as "work done by a perfect gas", so if the gas is expanding, it's doing work, and W would be positive. But in that case, if the gas expands and does work, its internal energy would decrease (ΔU negative) only if the temperature decreases, which contradicts the given temperature increase. So perhaps the process is compression, and the work is done on the gas, hence W is negative.

Wait, but the problem says "work done by a perfect gas", so if the gas is expanding, it's doing positive work. But in that case, the internal energy would decrease, leading to a lower temperature, which isn't the case here. So perhaps the temperature increase implies that the gas is being compressed, so work is done on it, making W negative (work done by the gas is negative, meaning work is done on it). So in that case, the work done by the gas is negative, which aligns with the options given.

So going back, my calculation gave W = -22.66 Btu/lb, which would be option not listed. But the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the integration.

Wait, let's recompute the integral step by step.

Compute ∫ (Cp - R) dT from 200 to 300.

Cp = 0.212 + 0.000059 T.

So Cp - R = 0.212 + 0.000059 T - 0.000128.

So the integral becomes ∫ (0.212 - 0.000128 + 0.000059 T) dT.

Which is ∫ (0.211872 + 0.000059 T) dT.

Integrate term by term:

∫ 0.211872 dT = 0.211872 * (300 - 200) = 0.211872 * 100 = 21.1872.

∫ 0.000059 T dT = 0.000059 * ∫ T dT = 0.000059 * [ (T^2)/2 ] from 200 to 300.

Compute (300^2 - 200^2)/2 = (90000 - 40000)/2 = 50000/2 = 25000.

Multiply by 0.000059: 0.000059 * 25000 = 1.475.

So total integral is 21.1872 + 1.475 = 22.6622.

Then W = -22.6622 Btu/lb.

But none of the options match this. The closest is option B: -25.47, which is lower. Hmm. Did I make a mistake in the calculation of R?

Wait, perhaps I should have used a different value for R. Let me check another approach.

Alternatively, maybe I should use the relation between Cp and Cv in terms of degrees of freedom or something else, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the specific heat at constant pressure is given, and the process is adiabatic, so maybe I can use the relation for work in terms of Cp and the temperature change.

Wait, another approach: For an ideal gas undergoing any process, the work done can be expressed as W = m ∫ (P dV). But without knowing the relation between P and V, it's hard to compute. Alternatively, since it's adiabatic, we can use the relation PV^γ = constant, but without knowing γ, which is Cp/Cv, it's tricky because Cp and Cv are varying with temperature.

Hmm, perhaps the problem expects me to use the average value of Cp over the temperature range. But that might not be accurate, but let's try.

First, compute average Cp between 200 and 300°F.

At T1=200: Cp1 = 0.212 + 0.000059*200 = 0.212 + 0.0118 = 0.2238 Btu/lbm·°F.

At T2=300: Cp2 = 0.212 + 0.000059*300 = 0.212 + 0.0177 = 0.2297 Btu/lbm·°F.

Average Cp = (0.2238 + 0.2297)/2 ≈ 0.22675 Btu/lbm·°F.

Then, Cv_avg = Cp_avg - R = 0.22675 - 0.000128 ≈ 0.22662 Btu/lbm·°F.

Then, ΔU = m * Cv_avg * ΔT = m * 0.22662 * 100 = 22.662 m Btu.

So W = -ΔU = -22.662 m Btu.

Assuming m=1 lbm, W = -22.662 Btu/lb. Again, this doesn't match any option.

Wait, but the options are all different. Maybe I made a mistake in the units somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should check if R is correctly calculated. Let me try another approach to calculate R in Btu/lbm·°F.

Given:

R = 8.314 J/mol·K.

Convert J to Btu: 1 J = 0.00094778 Btu.

So R = 8.314 * 0.00094778 ≈ 0.00789 Btu/mol·K.

Convert K to °F: 1 K = 1.8 °F. So per °F, R = 0.00789 / 1.8 ≈ 0.004383 Btu/mol·°F.

Now, molecular weight M = 34 lbm/mol, so R per lbm is R = 0.004383 / 34 ≈ 0.0001289 Btu/lbm·°F.

So that's correct. So Cv = Cp - R.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that I should have used Cp in Btu/lbm·°F, but in the integral, the units are Btu/lbm·°F * °F = Btu/lbm. So the calculation seems correct.

Wait, but looking at the options, perhaps the answer is not among them, but that's unlikely. Maybe I made a mistake in the integration.

Wait, let me recheck the integral.

∫ (Cp - R) dT from 200 to 300.

Cp = 0.212 + 0.000059 T.

Cp - R = 0.212 + 0.000059 T - 0.000128.

So, 0.212 - 0.000128 = 0.211872.

So, Cp - R = 0.211872 + 0.000059 T.

Integrating from 200 to 300:

∫ (0.211872) dT = 0.211872 * (300 - 200) = 21.1872.

∫ (0.000059 T) dT from 200 to 300 = 0.000059 * [ (300^2 - 200^2)/2 ] = 0.000059 * (90000 - 40000)/2 = 0.000059 * 25000 = 1.475.

So total is 21.1872 + 1.475 = 22.6622.

So W = -22.6622 Btu/lb.

But the options don't have this. Hmm. Maybe the problem expects me to use Cp as a constant, not varying with temperature. Let's try that approach, even though it's an approximation.

Using Cp as the average value, which we calculated as approximately 0.22675 Btu/lbm·°F.

So Cv_avg = 0.22675 - 0.000128 ≈ 0.22662 Btu/lbm·°F.

Then, ΔU = m * Cv_avg * ΔT = m * 0.22662 * 100 = 22.662 m.

Again, W = -22.662 m Btu.

Same result. So perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, perhaps the process is not expansion but compression, so the work done by the gas is negative, which would match the options. So in that case, the answer would be -22.66, but that's not an option. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the sign convention.

Wait, let me think differently. Maybe I should use the formula for work in an adiabatic process where W = m Cp (T1 - T2) / (γ - 1), but since γ = Cp/Cv, and both vary with temperature, this approach isn't directly applicable. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the average Cp and Cv values.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I should calculate the work using the relation W = m Cp ΔT / (γ - 1), but since γ varies, maybe using the average value. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the integration. Let me check the integral again.

Wait, wait, Cp is given as 0.212 + 0.000059 T, where T is in °F. So when T is 200°F, Cp is 0.212 + 0.000059*200 = 0.212 + 0.0118 = 0.2238 Btu/lbm·°F.

Similarly, at 300°F, Cp = 0.212 + 0.000059*300 = 0.212 + 0.0177 = 0.2297 Btu/lbm·°F.

So the average Cp is (0.2238 + 0.2297)/2 ≈ 0.22675 Btu/lbm·°F.

Then, Cv_avg = 0.22675 - 0.000128 ≈ 0.22662 Btu/lbm·°F.

So ΔU = m * Cv_avg * ΔT = 0.22662 * 100 = 22.662 Btu/lb.

Thus, W = -22.662 Btu/lb.

Again, same result. But the options don't have this. So perhaps the problem expects a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the process is isobaric or something else, but no, it's adiabatic.

Wait, perhaps I should use the relation between work and temperature change directly. For an ideal gas, the work done in an adiabatic process can be expressed as W = m Cp (T1 - T2) / (γ - 1), but since γ is Cp/Cv, and both vary, this might not be applicable. Alternatively, perhaps using the mean effective specific heat.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the formula W = m Cp (T1 - T2) / (γ - 1), but with γ as Cp/Cv, which would require me to compute γ as a function of temperature, which complicates things.

Wait, perhaps I should use the fact that for an ideal gas, the work done is W = m Cp (T1 - T2) / (γ - 1), but since γ = Cp/Cv, and Cv = Cp - R, γ = Cp/(Cp - R).

But since Cp varies with T, this would require integrating. Alternatively, perhaps using an average value.

But this seems too complicated, and I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the problem is simpler. Maybe it's intended to use the average Cp and Cv values, and thus W = m (Cp_avg - Cv_avg) * ΔT, but I'm not sure.

Wait, no, because Cv_avg = Cp_avg - R, so (Cp_avg - Cv_avg) = R.

So W = m R ΔT.

Using R = 0.000128 Btu/lbm·°F, ΔT = 100°F.

So W = 0.000128 * 100 = 0.0128 Btu/lb.

But this is way off from the options. So perhaps this approach is incorrect.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is using the relation W = m Cp (T1 - T2) / (γ - 1), but with γ considered constant. Let's try that.

Assume γ = Cp/Cv.

But since Cp = 0.212 + 0.000059 T, and Cv = Cp - R, γ = Cp/(Cp - R).

But this varies with T, so perhaps using an average value.

At T1=200, Cp=0.2238, Cv=0.2238 - 0.000128 = 0.223672.

γ1 = 0.2238 / 0.223672 ≈ 1.000576.

At T2=300, Cp=0.2297, Cv=0.2297 - 0.000128 = 0.229572.

γ2 = 0.2297 / 0.229572 ≈ 1.000561.

Average γ ≈ (1.000576 + 1.000561)/2 ≈ 1.000569.

So approximately γ ≈ 1.00057.

Then, W = m Cp_avg (T1 - T2)/(γ - 1).

Cp_avg = 0.22675.

(T1 - T2) = -100°F.

So W = m * 0.22675 * (-100) / (0.00057).

Wait, but W would be negative, implying work is done on the gas, which aligns with temperature increasing.

Calculating:

0.22675 * (-100) = -22.675.

Divide by 0.00057: -22.675 / 0.00057 ≈ -40,000 Btu/lb. That's way too high and doesn't match any option. So this approach must be wrong.

I'm stuck. My initial approach gives W ≈ -22.66 Btu/lb, but the options don't have that. The closest option is B: -25.47, but that's not close. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of R.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the R calculation. Let me try converting R from J/mol·K to Btu/lbm·°F.

R = 8.314 J/mol·K.

Convert J to Btu: 8.314 J = 8.314 * 0.00094778 Btu ≈ 0.00789 Btu/mol·K.

Now, convert K to °F: 1 K = 1.8 °F, so per °F, R = 0.00789 / 1.8 ≈ 0.004383 Btu/mol·°F.

Molecular weight M = 34 lbm/mol, so R per lbm is 0.004383 / 34 ≈ 0.0001289 Btu/lbm·°F.

Yes, that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps the problem expects me to ignore the R term, which would be a mistake, but let's see what happens.

If I ignore R, then Cv = Cp, which isn't correct, but just for the sake of checking:

Then, W = - ∫ Cp dT from 200 to 300.

So ∫ (0.212 + 0.000059 T) dT from 200 to 300.

Which is 0.212*100 + 0.000059*(25000) = 21.2 + 1.475 = 22.675.

Then W = -22.675 Btu/lb, same as before.

So that's not helping.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to use the specific heat at constant volume as a constant value, not varying with temperature. Let's try that.

Assume Cv is constant. Then, since Cp = Cv + R, Cv = Cp - R.

But Cp is given as a function of temperature, so perhaps using the value of Cp at the average temperature.

Average T = (200 + 300)/2 = 250°F.

Cp_avg = 0.212 + 0.000059*250 = 0.212 + 0.01475 = 0.22675 Btu/lbm·°F.

Cv_avg = 0.22675 - 0.000128 ≈ 0.22662 Btu/lbm·°F.

Then, ΔU = m * Cv_avg * ΔT = 0.22662 * 100 = 22.662 Btu/lb.

So W = -22.662 Btu/lb.

Again, same result.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the answer to be positive, and the options have a negative, so the correct answer would be -22.66, but it's not listed. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the sign.

Wait, let's think: if the gas is expanding (doing work), the temperature should decrease, but in this problem, the temperature increases from 200 to 300, so the gas is being compressed, work is done on it, so work done by the gas is negative.

So W is negative, which matches the options. But none of the options are near -22.66.

Wait, perhaps I should check the options again. The options are:

A: -19.55

B: -25.47

C: -30.22

D:5.67

E:8.23

F:12.34

G:-15.36

H:0

I:-4.19

J:-10.89

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the integral calculation. Let me recompute the integral without approximating R.

R per lbm·°F is 0.000128.

So Cp - R = 0.212 + 0.000059 T - 0.000128.

At T=200: 0.212 + 0.0118 - 0.000128 = 0.223672.

At T=300: 0.212 + 0.0177 - 0.000128 = 0.229572.

The integral of (0.212 + 0.000059 T - 0.000128) dT from 200 to 300.

= ∫ (0.211872 + 0.000059 T) dT.

= 0.211872*(300-200) + 0.000059*(300^2 - 200^2)/2.

= 21.1872 + 0.000059*(50000)/2.

= 21.1872 + 0.000059*25000.

= 21.1872 + 1.475.

= 22.6622.

So W = -22.6622.

But again, no option matches. Maybe the problem expects me to take Cp as a constant, ignoring the T dependence. Let's try that.

Assume Cp is constant at Cp = 0.212 + 0.000059*(average T). Average T = 250°F, so Cp = 0.212 + 0.000059*250 ≈ 0.212 + 0.01475 = 0.22675 Btu/lbm·°F.

Then, Cv = Cp - R = 0.22675 - 0.000128 ≈ 0.22662 Btu/lbm·°F.

ΔU = 0.22662 * 100 = 22.662.

W = -22.662.

Still no match. Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different value for R.

Wait, perhaps R is taken as 0.0128 Btu/lbm·°F. Let me check.

If R were 0.0128, then Cv = Cp - 0.0128.

At T=200, Cp=0.2238, Cv=0.2238 - 0.0128=0.211.

At T=300, Cp=0.2297, Cv=0.2297 - 0.0128=0.2169.

Then, ΔU = ∫ (0.211 + 0.2169)/2 * ΔT = (0.214) * 100 = 21.4.

W = -21.4, which is close to option A: -19.55 but not exact.

But this R value is much larger than what I calculated earlier. So perhaps I made a mistake in R's value.

Wait, perhaps R is 0.0128 Btu/lbm·°F. Let me check the calculation again.

R = 8.314 J/mol·K.

Convert to Btu/mol·K: 8.314 * 0.00094778 ≈ 0.00789 Btu/mol·K.

Convert to Btu/mol·°F: 0.00789 / 1.8 ≈ 0.004383 Btu/mol·°F.

Per lbm: 0.004383 / 34 ≈ 0.0001289 Btu/lbm·°F.

So R is approximately 0.0001289, not 0.0128. So my earlier calculation was correct.

Thus, I'm stuck. My calculation gives W ≈ -22.66, which isn't an option. Perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the process is not adiabatic? No, the question says it is.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the relation W = m Cp (T1 - T2) / (γ - 1), but with γ as Cp/Cv at the average temperature.

At T=250°F, Cp=0.22675, Cv=0.22675 - 0.000128≈0.22662.

γ = Cp/Cv ≈ 0.22675 / 0.22662 ≈ 1.00057.

Then, W = m * 0.22675 * (200 - 300) / (1.00057 - 1).

Wait, but γ - 1 ≈ 0.00057.

So W = m * 0.22675 * (-100) / 0.00057 ≈ m * (-22.675) / 0.00057 ≈ m * (-40,000).

That's way too high, so this can't be right.

I'm really stuck here. Maybe I should look for a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the relation W = m Cp (T1 - T2) / (γ - 1), but with γ as Cp/Cv at T1 and T2, and using an average.

But this seems too complicated and not leading me anywhere.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the specific heat at constant pressure directly, ignoring the need for Cv. But that doesn't make sense because the work done in an adiabatic process relates to the change in internal energy, which depends on Cv.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is using the relation W = m Cp (T1 - T2) / (γ - 1), but with γ as Cp/Cv, and Cp and Cv being functions of temperature. But without knowing more, it's hard to proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to approximate the integral by taking Cp as a constant, which we did earlier, but that still doesn't match the options.

Wait, perhaps I should check the options again and see if any are close to my calculated value. My value is approximately -22.66, but the closest option is B: -25.47, which is about 2.8 off. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should recalculate the integral with more precision.

Cp - R = 0.212 + 0.000059 T - 0.000128.

So, 0.212 - 0.000128 = 0.211872.

The integral is ∫ (0.211872 + 0.000059 T) dT from 200 to 300.

= 0.211872*(300-200) + 0.000059*(300^2 - 200^2)/2.

= 0.211872*100 + 0.000059*(90000-40000)/2.

= 21.1872 + 0.000059*25000.

= 21.1872 + 1.475.

= 22.6622.

Yes, same result.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the answer in BTU/lbm, but I'm calculating in Btu/lb. No, they're the same.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses R as 0.0128 Btu/lbm·°F, which would be 100 times larger than what I calculated. Let's see what happens then.

If R = 0.0128, then Cv = Cp - 0.0128.

At T=200, Cp=0.2238, Cv=0.211.

At T=300, Cp=0.2297, Cv=0.2169.

Average Cv ≈ (0.211 + 0.2169)/2 ≈ 0.21395.

ΔU = 0.21395 * 100 = 21.395.

W = -21.395, which is close to option A: -19.55 but still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps R is taken as 0.00128 instead of 0.000128. Let's check.

If R = 0.00128, then Cv = Cp - 0.00128.

At T=200, Cp=0.2238, Cv=0.22252.

At T=300, Cp=0.2297, Cv=0.22842.

Average Cv ≈ (0.22252 + 0.22842)/2 ≈ 0.22547.

ΔU = 0.22547 * 100 = 22.547.

W = -22.547, which is close to my earlier calculation.

But again, no option matches.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to use the specific heat at constant volume as Cp - R, but not integrate, and instead use an average value.

Wait, perhaps I should use the mean value theorem for integrals. The integral of f(T) dT from a to b is (b - a) * f_avg, where f_avg is the average value.

So, f_avg = (f(a) + f(b))/2.

Here, f(T) = Cp - R = 0.212 + 0.000059 T - 0.000128.

At T=200: f(200) = 0.2238 - 0.000128 ≈ 0.223672.

At T=300: f(300) = 0.2297 - 0.000128 ≈ 0.229572.

Average f = (0.223672 + 0.229572)/2 ≈ 0.226622.

Then, integral = 0.226622 * 100 = 22.6622.

Same as before.

I'm stuck. I think I've done the correct calculation, but the answer isn't among the options. Perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption.

Wait, perhaps the process is not expansion but compression, so the work done by the gas is negative, which matches the options. So the answer would be -22.66, but that's not an option.

Wait, looking back at the options, option B is -25.47, which is about 2.8 off. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of Cp - R.

Wait, perhaps I should check the units again. Wait, Cp is given as 0.212 + 0.000059 T, but what are the units? The problem says "specific heat at constant pressure is given by the expression Cp = 0.212 + 0.000059T." It doesn't specify the units, but since the answer is in Btu/lb, Cp must be in Btu/lbm·°F.

So, when I calculate Cv, it's in Btu/lbm·°F, and the integral gives Btu/lb.

Thus, the calculation seems correct. I'm not sure why the answer isn't matching the options. Perhaps the intended approach was different.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to use the relation W = m Cp (T1 - T2) / (γ - 1), but with γ as Cp/Cv, where Cp and Cv are constants.

Assume Cp = 0.212 + 0.000059*T_avg, where T_avg = 250°F.

Cp_avg = 0.212 + 0.000059*250 ≈ 0.22675.

Cv_avg = Cp_avg - R = 0.22675 - 0.000128 ≈ 0.22662.

γ_avg = Cp_avg / Cv_avg ≈ 1.00057.

Then, W = m * Cp_avg * (T1 - T2) / (γ_avg - 1).

But (T1 - T2) is -100°F.

So W = 0.22675 * (-100) / (0.00057) ≈ (-22.675) / 0.00057 ≈ -40,000 Btu/lb, which is way too high.

This approach isn't working.

I think I've exhausted all options. My calculation consistently gives W ≈ -22.66 Btu/lb, which isn't among the options. Perhaps the intended answer is option B: -25.47, but I'm not sure how that would be obtained. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the integration limits.

Wait, perhaps the integral should be from 200 to 300, but in Rankine? Let me check.

Wait, no, because the specific heat is given as a function of °F, so the integral should be in °F.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the specific heat at constant volume as a constant value, not varying with temperature. Let's try that.

Assume Cv = Cp - R = (0.212 + 0.000059*T_avg) - R.

Where T_avg = 250°F.

Cp_avg = 0.212 + 0.000059*250 ≈ 0.22675.

Cv_avg = 0.22675 - 0.000128 ≈ 0.22662.

ΔU = 0.22662 * 100 = 22.662.

W = -22.662.

Still no match.

I think I've spent enough time on this. Based on my calculations, the answer should be approximately -22.66 Btu/lb, but since that's not an option, perhaps the closest option intended is B: -25.47, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of R.

Wait, perhaps R is 0.00128 instead of 0.000128. Let's see.

If R = 0.00128, then Cv = Cp - 0.00128.

At T=200, Cp=0.2238, Cv=0.22252.

At T=300, Cp=0.2297, Cv=0.22842.

Average Cv ≈ (0.22252 + 0.22842)/2 ≈ 0.22547.

ΔU = 0.22547 * 100 = 22.547.

W = -22.547.

Still not matching.

I think I'll have to go with my original calculation, but since it's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option B: -25.47, but I'm not confident.
</think>

The problem involves calculating the work done by a perfect gas during an adiabatic frictionless process when its temperature changes from 200°F to 300°F. The specific heat at constant pressure, \( C_p \), is given as \( C_p = 0.212 + 0.000059T \), where \( T \) is in °F, and the molecular weight is 34.0 lbm/mol. 

For an adiabatic process (\( Q = 0 \)), the first law of thermodynamics (\( \Delta U = Q - W \)) simplifies to \( W = -\Delta U \). The change in internal energy, \( \Delta U \), is calculated using the specific heat at constant volume, \( C_v \), which is related to \( C_p \) by \( C_v = C_p - R \), where \( R \) is the gas constant per unit mass. 

The gas constant \( R \) is calculated as follows:
- \( R = \frac{8.314 \, \text{J/mol·K}}{34 \, \text{lbm/mol}} \times \frac{1 \, \text{Btu}}{1055.586 \, \text{J}} \times \frac{1 \, \text{K}}{1.8 \, \text{°F}} \approx 0.000128 \, \text{Btu/lbm·°F} \).

The integral \( \Delta U = \int (C_p - R) \, dT \) is computed from \( T_1 = 200 \, \text{°F} \) to \( T_2 = 300 \, \text{°F} \):
\[
\Delta U = \int_{200}^{300} (0.212 + 0.000059T - 0.000128) \, dT
\]
Breaking this into terms:
\[
\Delta U = \int_{200}^{300} 0.211872 \, dT + \int_{200}^{300} 0.000059T \, dT
\]
\[
\Delta U = 0.211872 \times 100 + 0.000059 \times \frac{(300^2 - 200^2)}{2}
\]
\[
\Delta U = 21.1872 + 1.475 = 22.6622 \, \text{Btu/lb}
\]
Thus, \( W = -\Delta U = -22.6622 \, \text{Btu/lb} \).

However, this value does not match any of the provided options. The closest option is **B: -25.47 Btu/lb**, which may account for rounding or approximations not explicitly detailed in the problem.

**Answer: B**
