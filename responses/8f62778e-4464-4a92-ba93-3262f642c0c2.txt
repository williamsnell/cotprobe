Okay, so I'm trying to solve this economics problem about Bertrand competition. Let me think through it step by step.

Alright, the question says there are two firms in the market with no production costs. They're selling identical products, and the demand curve is given by Q = 150 - P. They choose prices simultaneously, like in the Bertrand model. I need to find the Nash equilibrium prices.

Hmm, I remember that in Bertrand competition, both firms set prices, and consumers buy from the cheaper one. If both set the same price, they split the market. Since there are no costs, the firms are trying to maximize their profits by choosing the best price.

So, first, I should figure out the inverse demand function. The given demand is Q = 150 - P, which I can rewrite as P = 150 - Q. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think. If Q = 150 - P, then P = 150 - Q. Wait, no, that's correct because if Q increases, P decreases. So P = 150 - Q.

But wait, in Bertrand, each firm chooses a price, and the total quantity is the sum of what each firm sells. But since the products are identical, consumers will buy from the cheaper firm. If both set the same price, they split the market.

So each firm's quantity is half of the total quantity demanded at that price. Let's denote P as the price set by each firm. If both set P, then total Q = 150 - P, and each firm sells Q/2 = (150 - P)/2.

But wait, in Nash equilibrium, each firm chooses its best response given the other's price. Since they're choosing prices simultaneously, they must be considering each other's prices.

Wait, but since there are no costs, the firms want to set the lowest possible price to capture the entire market, but if both do that, they split the market. So the equilibrium price is where neither firm can benefit by changing its price given the other's price.

Let me think: Suppose both set price P. Each sells Q/2 = (150 - P)/2. Their profit is then P * (150 - P)/2. Since there are no costs, profit is just total revenue.

To find the Nash equilibrium, each firm will choose P such that it's the best response to the other's P. So each firm's best response function is to set P equal to the other firm's price, because if one firm lowers its price, it can capture the entire market, but the other firm will respond in kind.

Wait, but with no costs, the best strategy is to undercut the opponent slightly. But since prices are simultaneous, they might end up in a price war driving down prices. But in the symmetric case, they'll set the same price.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to model this as each firm choosing P, and knowing that if they set P lower than the other, they get the whole market. If both set the same, split the market.

So, let's model the reaction functions. Each firm's profit is:

If firm 1 sets P1 and firm 2 sets P2.

If P1 < P2, firm 1 sells Q=150 - P1, profit is P1*(150 - P1).

If P2 < P1, firm 2 sells Q=150 - P2, profit is P2*(150 - P2).

If P1 = P2, each sells Q/2 = (150 - P)/2, so profit is P*(150 - P)/2.

In Nash equilibrium, neither firm can profit by changing its price given the other's price.

So, let's suppose both set price P. Each gets profit (P*(150 - P))/2. To find the best P, take the derivative of profit with respect to P and set it to zero.

Profit for each firm is (P*(150 - P))/2 = (150P - P²)/2.

Taking derivative: (150 - 2P)/2 = 0.

Multiply both sides by 2: 150 - 2P = 0 → 2P = 150 → P=75.

Wait, so each firm would set P=75. Because at that point, if they lower their price, they capture the whole market but their profit would be P*(150 - P), which at P=75 would be 75*75=5625. If they lower P to, say, 74, then their profit would be 74*(150-74)=74*76=5624, which is slightly less. So actually, lowering P slightly reduces profit. So P=75 is a maximum.

Wait, but wait. If both set P=75, they each get 75*75/2 = 2812.5 each. But if one lowers to 74, they capture the whole market: 74*(150-74)=74*76=5624. Which is higher than 2812.5. So why wouldn't a firm undercut?

Ah, but in equilibrium, both are considering each other's strategies. So if both are setting 75, and one firm lowers to 74, they capture the entire market, making a higher profit. But the other firm, seeing this, would also lower their price to 74, leading to the same outcome. So in reality, the Nash equilibrium is when both set the same price, and if one deviates, the other can undercut, leading to a lower price.

Wait, but in the symmetric case, the best response is to match the opponent's price. So if both set P, the best response is to set P as well. So the Nash equilibrium occurs at the price where each firm's best response is to set the same price.

Alternatively, maybe the Nash equilibrium occurs at P=75, but that seems a bit high. Let me think again. The inverse demand is P = 150 - Q. If two firms are splitting the market, each gets Q/2. So each firm's quantity is (150 - P)/2. Profit is P*(150 - P)/2.

To find the maximum profit, take derivative: (150 - 2P)/2 = 0 → P=75. So that's the symmetric Nash equilibrium. Because each firm is maximizing given the other's price.

But wait, if P=75 is where each firm's profit is maximized when the other is also at 75, but if one firm lowers to 74, they can make more profit by capturing the entire market. So why isn't the equilibrium at P=0, since they can undercut each other all the way down?

Ah, but in Bertrand competition with identical products and no costs, the equilibrium price is P=0. Because each firm can undercut the other, leading to a price war until prices reach zero. But wait, that's only if there's no capacity constraints.

Wait, but in this problem, there's no capacity constraints mentioned. So both firms can produce any quantity. So in that case, the Nash equilibrium would be P=0, because each firm can undercut the other, leading to the lowest possible price.

But wait, let me think again. If both set P=0, they each get half the market, which is 75 units each. Profit is zero, which is better than negative profits if they set a higher price and the other undercut.

Wait, no. If one firm sets P=1 and the other sets P=0, the firm with P=0 captures the entire market, getting Q=150 units, and profit 0*150=0. The other firm gets nothing. So setting P=0 is better for the firm setting it, but the other firm would respond by also setting P=0.

So in equilibrium, both set P=0, leading to zero profits, but neither can increase their profit by unilaterally changing their price because if they set P>0, the other firm can capture the entire market by setting P=0, giving them a profit of zero, which is the same as before. Wait, no, if I set P=1, and the other sets P=0, I get zero. So setting P=0 is the Nash equilibrium.

Wait, but earlier when I took the derivative, I got P=75 as the maximum profit point. But that's under the assumption that the other firm is setting P=75, and you can't undercut. But in reality, in Bertrand, you can undercut, so the Nash equilibrium is P=0.

Hmm, I'm a bit confused now. Let me check.

In Bertrand model without costs, the Nash equilibrium is P=0. Because each firm can undercut the other, leading to a price war. Since there are no costs, the firms will keep undercutting until P=0. Because any positive P can be undercut, leading to a lower price and capturing the entire market. So in equilibrium, both set P=0.

Wait, but in the earlier calculation, when both set P=75, each gets 75*75/2=2812.5 profit. But if one lowers to 74, they get 74*76=5624, which is higher. So why wouldn't they undercut?

Because if both are rational, they both will lower their prices. So the equilibrium is at P=0.

But wait, the options include C:0 and F:75. So which is correct?

I think the correct answer is P=75 because in the symmetric case, each firm's best response is to set the same price as the other, leading to P=75. But I'm not entirely sure because I remember that in Bertrand with no costs, the equilibrium is P=0.

Wait, no, maybe the key is that in the absence of costs, the equilibrium is P=0 because each firm can set P=0 and capture the entire market, but since both can do that, they end up splitting the market. But actually, if both set P=0, they each get half the market, leading to zero profits. But if one sets P=0 and the other sets P=epsilon>0, the one with P=0 captures the entire market, making zero profit (since P=0), while the other makes nothing. So P=0 is the equilibrium.

Wait, but the profit from P=0 is zero for each, but if one firm sets P=75 and the other sets P=75, their profits are higher. So why would they not set P=75?

Ah, because if one firm sets P=75 and the other sets P=74, the firm with P=74 captures the entire market, making more profit than if they both set P=75. So the Nash equilibrium is at P=0 because any positive price can be undercut.

Wait, but in the calculation earlier, when both set P=75, each gets 75*75/2=2812.5. If one lowers to 74, they get 74*76=5624, which is higher. So why not set P=74? Because the other firm will also lower to 74, leading to the same outcome as P=75 but with lower prices.

Wait, this is getting a bit tangled. Let me try to model it formally.

Each firm's profit function when both set P is (P*(150-P))/2.

But if firm 1 sets P1 and firm 2 sets P2, profits are:

If P1 < P2: Profit1 = P1*(150 - P1)
If P2 < P1: Profit2 = P2*(150 - P2)
If P1 = P2: Each gets (P*(150-P))/2.

In the Nash equilibrium, each firm's strategy is a best response to the other's strategy.

Assume both set P=75. Then each gets 75*75/2=2812.5.

If firm 1 deviates to P=74, and firm 2 sticks at 75, then firm 1 gets 74*(150-74)=74*76=5624, which is higher. But in reality, firm 2 would also lower to 74, so both end up at 74, each getting 74*76/2=2812, which is slightly less than 2812.5. So firm 1's incentive to lower is weak because the gain is minimal, but in reality, the other firm will also lower.

Wait, but if both lower their prices, the equilibrium could be at P=0. Because each can undercut the other all the way down.

Alternatively, maybe the Nash equilibrium is at P=75 because that's the point where each firm's marginal revenue equals the other's marginal cost, but since there are no costs, it's the point where the derivative is zero.

Wait, but no costs mean that the firms can set P=0 and still make zero profit, but capture the entire market. So why not set P=0.

I think the confusion arises because in the standard Bertrand model with no costs, the equilibrium price is P=0. Because each firm can undercut the other infinitely, leading to P=0.

But in some versions, if the firms have capacity constraints, the equilibrium might be higher. But in this problem, there are no capacity constraints mentioned, so I think the answer is P=0.

Wait, but the options have A:30, B:50, C:0, D:25, etc. So C is 0.

But earlier, when I took the derivative, I found P=75 as the maximum profit point when both set the same price. But that's under the assumption that they can't undercut. But in reality, in Bertrand, they can.

So the correct Nash equilibrium price is P=0, because each firm can undercut the other, leading to the lowest possible price, which is zero.
</think>

In the Bertrand model with two firms, no production costs, and an inverse demand curve \( P = 150 - Q \), the firms choose prices simultaneously. Since there are no costs, the firms aim to maximize profits by setting the lowest possible price to capture the entire market. If both firms set the same price, they split the market equally.

To find the Nash equilibrium, consider the following:

1. **Demand and Profit Function**: The total quantity demanded is \( Q = 150 - P \). If both firms set the same price \( P \), each firm sells \( \frac{Q}{2} = \frac{150 - P}{2} \). The profit for each firm is \( \pi = P \cdot \frac{150 - P}{2} = \frac{150P - P^2}{2} \).

2. **First-Order Condition**: Taking the derivative of the profit function with respect to \( P \) gives:
   \[
   \frac{d\pi}{dP} = \frac{150 - 2P}{2} = 0
   \]
   Solving for \( P \), we find \( P = 75 \). This is the price that maximizes profit if both firms set the same price.

3. **Bertrand Competition Dynamics**: However, in Bertrand competition, firms can undercut each other. If one firm sets a slightly lower price, it captures the entire market. This creates a price war, driving the price down. Since there are no costs, the firms can undercut each other indefinitely, leading to a Nash equilibrium at \( P = 0 \).

4. **Equilibrium Analysis**: At \( P = 0 \), both firms split the market, each selling 75 units, and make zero profit. If one firm deviates and sets a positive price, the other firm can capture the entire market by setting \( P = 0 \), resulting in zero profit for the deviating firm. Thus, \( P = 0 \) is the Nash equilibrium.
