Okay, let's try to figure out this insurance problem. So, the house is valued at $10,000, but it's insured for $7,000. There's an 80% coinsurance clause. Hmm, I remember coinsurance is about the policyholder maintaining a certain level of insurance relative to the value. So, if the coinsurance is 80%, that means the insured amount should be at least 80% of the property's value to get full coverage.

Wait, the house is insured for $7,000, and the value is $10,000. Let me check the coinsurance here. 80% of $10,000 is $8,000. But the insurance is only $7,000, which is less than 80%. So, that means the policyholder didn't meet the coinsurance requirement. That could affect the payout.

Now, the damage is $8,500. So, the question is, how much will the insurance company pay, and how much does the owner have to cover?

Since the policy is $7,000, but the coinsurance isn't met, the insurance might pay a percentage based on the coinsurance. I think when the coinsurance isn't met, the payout is calculated proportionally. So, the formula is usually (Insurance Amount / Value) * Loss. But wait, is it the other way around?

Wait, no. The coinsurance formula is (Insurance Amount / Value) = the coinsurance percentage. If that's less than the coinsurance clause, then the payout is limited. So, the payout is (Insurance Amount / Value) multiplied by the loss.

So, Insurance Amount is $7,000, Value is $10,000. So, 7000/10000 = 0.7, which is 70%. The coinsurance was supposed to be 80%, so here it's 70%. Therefore, the insurance will pay 70% of the loss.

The loss is $8,500. So, 70% of 8500 is 0.7 * 8500 = let's calculate that. 8500 * 0.7 is 5950? Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, no, 8000 *0.7 is 5600, 500*0.7 is 350, so total 5950? Hmm, but that's not one of the options. Wait, maybe I'm doing it wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the payout is based on the coinsurance percentage. Since the coinsurance is 80%, but the insurance is only 70% of the value, the payout could be 80% of the loss, but that doesn't make sense because the policy is only 70% of the value.

Wait, perhaps I should think differently. The coinsurance clause means the insured must cover 80% of the loss, and the insurance covers the rest. But in this case, the insured only has 70% of the value, so maybe the insurance only covers 70% of the loss.

No, wait, no. Coinsurance isn't about the percentage of the loss, but about the amount of coverage relative to the value. So, if the policy is under the required coinsurance, then the payout is reduced proportionally.

So, the formula is: Payout = (Insurance Amount / Required Coinsurance) * Loss.

Wait, no. Maybe the correct formula is (Insurance Amount / Value) * Loss, but only up to the insurance amount.

Wait, the standard coinsurance calculation is that if the insurance is less than the coinsurance value, the payout is (Insurance / Value) * Loss. So, here, Insurance is $7,000, Value is $10,000, so 7/10 = 0.7. So, 0.7 * 8,500 = 5,950. But looking at the options, I don't see 5,950. The closest is E: $5,600 or F: $6,500. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculation.

Wait, 8,500 * 0.7 is 5,950. Hmm, not matching any of the options. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the coinsurance.

Alternatively, perhaps the coinsurance clause requires the insured to cover 20% of the loss, so the insurance covers 80%. But in this case, because the policy is under the required coinsurance, maybe the insurance only pays a portion based on the policy amount.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is:

The coinsurance requirement is 80%, so the insured must have at least 80% of the value ($8,000) in coverage. Since the policy is $7,000, which is less than 80%, the policy is underinsured.

In such cases, the payout is calculated as (Policy Amount / Required Coinsurance Amount) * Loss. So, Policy Amount is $7,000, Required Coinsurance is 80% of $10,000, which is $8,000.

So, the payout is (7000 / 8000) * 8500.

Calculating that: 7000/8000 = 0.875. 0.875 * 8500 = let's compute.

8500 * 0.875: 8500 * 0.8 = 6800; 8500 * 0.075 = 637.5. So total is 6800 + 637.5 = 7437.5.

Looking at the options, J is $7,437.50. So that would be the insurance payout, and the owner's share would be the remaining $8,500 - $7,437.50 = $1,062.50. But wait, the options don't directly list the owner's share, but the question asks both amounts.

Wait, the question asks how much the insurance pays and how much the owner assumes. So, according to the calculation, insurance pays $7,437.50, and the owner pays $1,062.50. But looking at the options, J is $7,437.50, which would be the insurance payment. So, the answer would be J for the insurance payment, but the question also asks for the owner's share, which isn't listed as an option. Wait, the options are A-J, each giving one amount.

Wait, the question is phrased as: How much will the insurance company pay on the loss? How much of the loss must the owner assume?

But the options are single numbers. So perhaps the question is asking for the amount the insurance pays, and the other part is the owner's share, but the options only give the insurance payout.

Wait, looking back, the options are A to J, each a single number. The question is asking for both amounts, but the options are individual amounts. So perhaps the options are only for the insurance payout, and the owner's share is a separate calculation. But the way the question is structured, it's unclear.

Wait, perhaps I should reevaluate. Maybe I made a mistake earlier.

Let me think again: the house is insured for $7,000 with an 80% coinsurance clause. So, the coinsurance means that the insured must pay 20%, and the insurance covers 80%, but only up to the policy limit.

Wait, no. Coinsurance is a way to prevent underinsurance. So, if the policy is less than the coinsurance amount, the payout is reduced proportionally.

So, in this case, the coinsurance is 80% of $10,000, which is $8,000. The policy is $7,000, which is less than $8,000. So, the payout is (7000 / 8000) * (8500) = 0.875 * 8500 = $7,437.50. So the insurance pays $7,437.50, and the owner would have to cover the remaining $1,062.50.

Looking at the options, J is $7,437.50, which would be the insurance payment. So the answer is J.

The house is insured for $7,000 with an 80% coinsurance clause, meaning the insured must cover 80% of the value ($10,000) or $8,000. Since the policy is $7,000, it's under the required coinsurance. The payout is calculated as (Policy Amount / Required Coinsurance Amount) * Loss: (7000 / 8000) * 8500 = $7,437.50. The insurance company pays $7,437.50, and the owner assumes the remaining $1,062.50. However, the question only asks for the insurance payout, which is option J.

Answer: J
