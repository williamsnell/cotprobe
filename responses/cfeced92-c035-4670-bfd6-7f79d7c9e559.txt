Question:

Which statement concerning the atrioventricular bundle is correct?

Options:

A: It is formed of autonomic nerve processes and forms one of several electrical connections between the atria and ventricles.
B: It is formed of Purkinje fibres and forms one of several electrical connections between the left atrium and the left ventricle.
C: It is formed of Purkinje fibres and has no electrical connection between the atria and the ventricles.
D: It is formed of autonomic nerve processes and forms one of several electrical connections between the right atrium and the right ventricle.
E: It is formed of Purkinje fibres and forms one of several electrical connections between the atria and ventricles.
F: It is formed of cardiac muscle cells and forms one of several electrical connections between the atria and ventricles.
G: It is formed of Purkinje fibres and is the only electrical connection between the atria and the ventricles
H: It is formed of autonomic nerve processes and is the only electrical connection between the left atrium and the left ventricle.
I: It is formed of muscle fibres and is the only electrical connection between the atria and the ventricles.
J: It is formed of autonomic nerve processes and is the only electrical connection between the atria and the ventricles.

Okay, so I've got this question about the atrioventricular bundle, and I need to pick the correct statement from options A to J. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that the atrioventricular bundle is part of the electrical conduction system in the heart. I think it's also called the bundle of His. So, what does it do? Well, the heart's electrical signals start in the SA node (sinoatrial node) in the right atrium, then travel through the atria, and then need to get to the ventricles. The AV bundle is responsible for conducting those signals from the atria to the ventricles.

Now, looking at the options, I need to figure out what the AV bundle is made of and what it connects. I recall that the AV bundle is composed of Purkinje fibers. These fibers are specialized cardiac muscle cells that are part of the传导 system. So any option that says it's formed of autonomic nerves or muscle fibers might not be correct.

Option A says it's formed of autonomic nerves and connects atria to ventricles. But I think the AV bundle is made of Purkinje fibers, not autonomic nerves. So A might be wrong.

Option B says Purkinje fibres connecting left atrium to left ventricle. Wait, the AV bundle connects both atria to both ventricles, not just the left. So B is probably incorrect.

Option C says Purkinje fibres with no electrical connection. That doesn't make sense because the AV bundle is all about conducting electricity. So C is wrong.

Option D: Autonomic nerves connecting right atrium to right ventricle. Again, it's Purkinje, not autonomic. Plus, the AV bundle connects both sides, not just the right. So D is out.

Option E: Purkinje fibres and connects atria to ventricles. This sounds right. The AV bundle is made of Purkinje fibers and it's one of the main pathways for the electrical connection between atria and ventricles.

Option F: Cardiac muscle cells, which is correct, but the AV bundle isn't just one of several connections—it's the main one. Wait, no, actually, there are other pathways like the Bachmann bundle, but the AV bundle is the primary one. Hmm, not sure if F is correct because it says "one of several", which might be true. But the bundle itself is formed of Purkinje, not just muscle cells. So F's description might not be precise enough.

Option G: Purkinje fibres and only connection. Wait, no, because in reality, besides the AV bundle, there are other pathways like the anterior ventral and posterior ventral bundles, which are part of the AV bundle's branches. So the AV bundle itself isn't the only connection. So G is incorrect.

Option H: Autonomic nerves connecting left atrium to left ventricle. No, same issue as before—it's Purkinje, and it's a broader connection. So H is out.

Option I: Muscle fibres and only connection. The AV bundle is made of Purkinje, which are specialized muscle cells, but it's not the only connection. So I is wrong.

Option J: Autonomic nerves and only connection between atria and ventricles. Again, the composition is wrong, and it's not the only connection. So J is incorrect.

So, going back, the correct statement should be E: It is formed of Purkinje fibres and forms one of several electrical connections between the atria and ventricles. Although, wait, the AV bundle is actually the main pathway, but the question says "one of several". I think that's correct because there are other minor pathways, but the AV bundle is the primary one. So E is the best choice.

The correct answer is E: It is formed of Purkinje fibres and forms one of several electrical connections between the atria and ventricles.
