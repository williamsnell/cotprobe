Okay, so Mr. Smith wants to find out the interest he'll receive on $300 at a 3% annual compound interest rate over three years. Hmm, I remember that compound interest means the interest is calculated on the initial principal and also on the accumulated interest from previous periods. So it's not just simple interest where you just multiply principal by rate by time.

The formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where:
- A is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.
- P is the principal amount ($300 in this case).
- r is the annual interest rate (decimal form, so 3% would be 0.03).
- n is the number of times that interest is compounded per year. Since it's compounded annually, n is 1.
- t is the time the money is invested for in years (3 years here).

So plugging in the numbers:
P = 300
r = 0.03
n = 1
t = 3

A = 300*(1 + 0.03/1)^(1*3) = 300*(1.03)^3

Now I need to calculate (1.03)^3. Let me do that step by step. 

First, 1.03 squared is 1.03 * 1.03. Let's see:
1.03 * 1.03:
- 1*1 = 1
- 1*0.03 = 0.03
- 0.03*1 = 0.03
- 0.03*0.03 = 0.0009
Adding them up: 1 + 0.03 + 0.03 + 0.0009 = 1.0609. So 1.03^2 = 1.0609.

Now, multiply that by 1.03 again to get 1.03^3. So 1.0609 * 1.03.

Let's calculate that:
1.0609 * 1.03:
- 1 * 1.03 = 1.03
- 0.06 * 1.03 = 0.0618
- 0.0009 * 1.03 = 0.000927
Adding them up: 1.03 + 0.0618 = 1.0918, plus 0.000927 gives 1.092727.

So 1.03^3 is approximately 1.092727.

Now multiply that by the principal, $300:
300 * 1.092727 = ?

Let me compute that. 300 * 1 = 300, 300 * 0.092727 = ?

0.092727 * 300:
- 0.09 * 300 = 27
- 0.002727 * 300 ≈ 0.8181
So total is approximately 27 + 0.8181 = 27.8181.

So adding to the principal, 300 + 27.8181 ≈ 327.8181.

Wait, but the question asks for the interest received, not the total amount. So the interest is the amount minus the principal. So 327.8181 - 300 = 27.8181, which is approximately $27.82.

Looking at the options, option C is $27.82. So the answer should be C.

The interest earned is calculated using the compound interest formula, resulting in approximately $27.82.
