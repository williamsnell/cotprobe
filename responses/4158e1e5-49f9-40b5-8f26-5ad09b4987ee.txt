Okay, so I have this physics problem here about finding the frequency of radiation emitted during a pure rotational transition in HCl. The transition is from J=1 to J=0. Hmm, I remember that rotational transitions in molecules are related to their rotational energy levels. 

I think the formula for the rotational energy levels is something like E_J = B * J*(J+1), where B is the rotational constant. Right, B is related to the moment of inertia I, and I is μr², where μ is the reduced mass and r is the bond length. Oh wait, the bond length here is given as 1.3 Å, which is 1.3e-10 meters.

So, the energy difference between J=1 and J=0 would be ΔE = E_1 - E_0. E_0 is zero because when J=0, J*(J+1) is 0. So ΔE = B*(1*(1+1)) = 2B.

The frequency ν of the emitted radiation is related to the energy difference by ΔE = hν, where h is Planck's constant. So I can write ν = ΔE/h = 2B/h.

Now I need to find B. B is given by ħ²/(2I), but wait, another way to write B is hc/(8π²I), where c is the speed of light. Alternatively, B can be expressed as (h/(8π²Ic)), but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. Oh right, B = ħ/(2I), since ħ is h/(2π). Wait no, the exact formula for B is B = (h/(8π² I c)), but I might be mixing up some terms. Alternatively, B is often expressed as (h/(8π² I c)) when considering rotational spectroscopy. Or wait, another approach: the rotational constant B is related to the moment of inertia I by B = h/(8π² I c) * something? Hmm, maybe it's easier to use the formula B = (h/(8π² I)) * (1/(2I)) or something. No, I think I should get back to the definition. 

Wait, the rotational constant B is defined as B = (h/(8π² I)), but I might have to check the units. Oh wait, I think B has units of cm^-1, but in terms of energy, it's actually E_J = B * J*(J+1) where B is in cm^-1. Alternatively, sometimes B is expressed in terms of energy as B = (h^2)/(8π² I c), but I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe a better approach is to calculate I first.

I is the moment of inertia, which is μ r². μ is the reduced mass. For HCl, the reduced mass μ = (m_H * m_Cl)/(m_H + m_Cl). But wait, m_H is the mass of hydrogen, approximately 1.00784 u (atomic mass units), and m_Cl is about 34.96885 u. So μ = (1.00784 * 34.96885) / (1.00784 + 34.96885). Let me calculate that.

Wait, but 1 u is about 1.660539e-27 kg. So first, let's compute the numerator and denominator in atomic mass units. Numerator: 1.00784 * 34.96885 ≈ let's see, 1 *35 is 35, but more precisely 1.00784 *34.96885. Hmm, 1.00784 *34.96885 ≈ approximately 35.23 u. Denominator: 1.00784 +34.96885 ≈ 36. So μ ≈ 35.23 / 36 ≈ 0.9786 u. That's about 0.9786 * 1.660539e-27 kg ≈ let's compute that. 0.9786 *1.660539e-27 ≈ around 1.615e-27 kg.

Wait, but maybe I can approximate μ as roughly (1 *35)/(36) )= 35/36 ≈ 0.9722 u. But I should be more precise. Alternatively, maybe I can find μ in kg. Let's see, m_H ≈ 1.67e-27 kg, m_Cl ≈ 35.45e-3 kg? Wait no, wait. Wait, 1 u is about 1.66e-27 kg. So m_H is about 1.00784 u, so in kg, that's 1.00784 *1.6605e-27 ≈ 1.674e-27 kg. Similarly, m_Cl is about 34.96885 u, so 34.96885 *1.6605e-27 ≈ 5.801e-26 kg.

So μ = (m_H * m_Cl) / (m_H + m_Cl) = (1.674e-27 kg *5.801e-26 kg) / (1.674e-27 +5.801e-26). Let's compute numerator and denominator.

Numerator: 1.674e-27 *5.801e-26 = approximately 1.674 *5.801e-53 = let's compute 1.674 *5.801 ≈ 9.708. So 9.708e-53 kg².

Denominator: 1.674e-27 +5.801e-26 = 1.674e-27 +58.01e-27 = (1.674 +58.01) e-27 = 59.684e-27 kg.

So μ = 9.708e-53 /59.684e-27 = (9.708 /59.684) *1e-26 ≈ 0.1627e-26 kg ≈ 1.627e-27 kg.

Wait, that's close to the earlier approximation. So I = μ r². r is 1.3 Å =1.3e-10 meters. So r² = (1.3e-10)^2 = 1.69e-20 m².

So I = 1.627e-27 kg * 1.69e-20 m² = approximately 1.627 *1.69e-47 kg·m². Let's calculate 1.627 *1.69: 1.6*1.69=2.704, 0.027*1.69≈0.04563. So total ≈ 2.7496e-47 kg·m².

Now, the rotational constant B is given by B = ħ²/(2I), where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. Wait, or is it B = h/(8π² I)? Because sometimes B is expressed in terms of energy as B = h/(8π² I c), but I think I'm mixing it up. Let me get this right.

Wait, the rotational energy levels are E_J = B J (J+1). B in terms of energy is B = h c B_rot, where B_rot is the rotational constant in wavenumbers (cm^-1). Alternatively, sometimes B is expressed in terms of angular frequency.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to use the formula for the frequency of the transition. The energy difference between J=1 and J=0 is ΔE = E_1 - E_0 = B (1*(1+1) - 0) ) = 2B. So ΔE = 2B.

But B is the rotational constant in terms of energy. So to find the frequency ν, ΔE = h ν → ν = ΔE/h = (2B)/h.

Now, B is given by B = (h²)/(8 π² I c), but wait, I think I'm mixing it up. Alternatively, B is given by B = (h/(8 π² I)) * (something), perhaps. Let me think again.

Wait, another formula I remember is that the rotational constant B is related to the moment of inertia by B = h/(8 π² I c), where c is the speed of light. Wait, no, I think that's for the rotational constant expressed in terms of wavenumbers (cm^-1). Let me check the units.

The moment of inertia I has units of kg·m². Planck's constant h has units of J·s (kg·m²/s). So h/(8 π² I) would have units of (kg·m²/s) / (kg·m²) ) = 1/s. But rotational constants in spectroscopy are often expressed in cm^-1, which is energy per photon (since E = h c ν, and ν in cm^-1 is E/hc).

Wait, perhaps to get B in terms of energy, it's better to use B = (h^2)/(8 π² I c), which would give units of energy.

Alternatively, I'm getting a bit confused, so maybe I should use the general approach. The energy levels for rotation are E_J = (ħ²/(2I)) J (J+1). So the energy difference between J=1 and J=0 is ΔE = (ħ²/(2I)) * [1*(1+1) - 0] = (ħ²/(2I)) * 2 = ħ²/(I).

So ΔE = ħ²/(I). Then the frequency ν = ΔE/h = (ħ²)/(I h) → since ħ = h/(2π), substituting that in: ( (h/(2π))² ) / (I h) ) = h²/(4 π² I) * 1/(I h) ) → Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, let's compute it correctly.

ΔE = ħ²/(I) → since ħ= h/(2π), so ħ²= h²/(4 π²). So ΔE = (h²/(4 π² I)) → ν = ΔE/h = (h²/(4 π² I)) / h = h/(4 π² I).

Wait, but I think I must have made a mistake here. Let me double-check. The rotational energy for a diatomic molecule is E_J = (ħ²/(2I)) J (J+1). So for J=0, E_0=0. For J=1, E_1= (ħ²/(2I)) * 2. So ΔE = E_1 - E_0 = (2 ħ²)/(2I) )= ħ²/(I). So yes, ΔE = ħ²/(I).

Then, ν = ΔE/h = (ħ²/(I)) / h. Since ħ = h/(2π), substituting: ( (h²/(4 π²)) / I ) / h )= h/(4 π² I).

So ν = h/(4 π² I).

Now, I have I = 1.627e-27 kg * (1.3e-10 m)^2. Wait, no, I = μ r², which we computed earlier as approximately 2.7496e-47 kg·m². Wait no, earlier calculation for I was I = μ r² = 1.627e-27 kg * 1.69e-20 m² = 2.74963e-47 kg·m².

So substituting into ν: h is Planck's constant, 6.62607015e-34 J·s.

So ν = (6.626e-34) / (4 π² * 2.74963e-47).

Let me compute the denominator first: 4 * π² ≈ 4 *9.8696 ≈ 39.478. So 39.478 * 2.74963e-47 ≈ let's compute 39.478 *2.74963 ≈ 39.478 *2.75 ≈ 108.31 (approximate). So 108.31e-47 → 1.0831e-45.

So ν ≈ 6.626e-34 / 1.0831e-45 ≈ 6.626 / 1.0831 ≈ 6.12 → 6.12e( -34 +45 )= 6.12e11 Hz.

Wait, that's 6.12e11 Hz. Looking at the options, option C is 0.615e12 Hz, which is 6.15e11 Hz, very close to my calculation. So that's option C.

But wait, let me double-check the calculations because the numbers are quite precise.

Wait, I think I might have made a mistake in calculating I. Let me recalculate I more accurately.

μ = (m_H * m_Cl) / (m_H + m_Cl). m_H = 1.00784 u, m_Cl = 34.96885 u.

μ = (1.00784 * 34.96885) / (1.00784 +34.96885) = (35.2337) / (36.0) = approximately 0.97871 u.

Convert μ to kg: 0.97871 u * 1.660539e-27 kg/u ≈ 0.97871 *1.660539e-27 ≈ let's compute that.

0.97871 *1.660539 ≈ 1.625. So μ ≈ 1.625e-27 kg.

r = 1.3 Å = 1.3e-10 m. So r² = (1.3e-10)^2 = 1.69e-20 m².

I = μ * r² = 1.625e-27 kg * 1.69e-20 m² = 1.625 *1.69e-47 kg·m².

1.625 *1.69: 1*1.69=1.69, 0.625*1.69= approx 1.05625. So total ≈ 2.74625e-47 kg·m².

Now, ν = h/(4 π² I) → h = 6.62607015e-34 J·s.

4 π² ≈ 39.4784.

So denominator: 39.4784 * 2.74625e-47 ≈ 39.4784 *2.74625 ≈ let's compute 39 *2.74625 ≈ 107.10375, plus 0.4784*2.74625≈1.316. So total ≈ 108.42e-47 → 1.0842e-45.

So ν ≈ 6.62607e-34 / 1.0842e-45 ≈ 6.62607 / 1.0842 ≈ 6.115e11 Hz.

Which is 0.6115e12 Hz. The options are:

A: 0.715e12 → 7.15e11

B:0.215e12 →2.15e11

C:0.615e12 →6.15e11

D:0.815e12 →8.15e11

So 6.115e11 is close to option C (0.615e12). So the answer should be C.

To determine the frequency of radiation emitted during the pure rotational transition \( J = 1 \rightarrow J = 0 \) in HCl, we use the rotational energy levels formula \( E_J = B \cdot J(J+1) \), where \( B \) is the rotational constant. The energy difference \( \Delta E \) is given by:

\[
\Delta E = E_1 - E_0 = B \cdot [1(1+1) - 0] = 2B
\]

The frequency \( \nu \) is related to the energy difference by \( \Delta E = h\nu \), so:

\[
\nu = \frac{\Delta E}{h} = \frac{2B}{h}
\]

The rotational constant \( B \) is expressed as:

\[
B = \frac{h}{8\pi^2 I c}
\]

where \( I \) is the moment of inertia, given by \( I = \mu r^2 \), \( \mu \) is the reduced mass, and \( r \) is the bond length. The reduced mass \( \mu \) for HCl is calculated as:

\[
\mu = \frac{m_H \cdot m_{Cl}}{m_H + m_{Cl}}
\]

Using \( m_H \approx 1.00784 \, \text{u} \) and \( m_{Cl} \approx 34.96885 \, \text{u} \), we find \( \mu \approx 0.97871 \, \text{u} \), which converts to \( \mu \approx 1.625 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \). The bond length \( r = 1.3 \, \text{Å} = 1.3 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \), so:

\[
I = \mu r^2 = (1.625 \times 10^{-27}) \cdot (1.3 \times 10^{-10})^2 = 2.746 \times 10^{-47} \, \text{kg·m}^2
\]

Substituting \( I \) into the formula for \( B \), we calculate:

\[
B = \frac{h}{8\pi^2 I} = \frac{6.626 \times 10^{-34}}{8\pi^2 \cdot 2.746 \times 10^{-47}} \approx 1.084 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{Hz}
\]

The frequency \( \nu \) is then:

\[
\nu = \frac{2B}{h} = \frac{2 \cdot 1.084 \times 10^{-23}}{6.626 \times 10^{-34}} \approx 6.115 \times 10^{11} \, \text{Hz}
\]

This value corresponds closely to option **C: 0.615 × 10^12 Hz**.
