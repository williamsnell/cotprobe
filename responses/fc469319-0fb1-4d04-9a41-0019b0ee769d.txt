Okay, so I've got this initial value problem to solve. The equation is y' = (t y (4 - y)) / 3, and the initial condition is y(0) = 0.5. I need to find the time T when the solution first reaches 3.98. The options are given from A to J.

First, I remember that this is a differential equation, and since it's first-order, maybe I can solve it using separation of variables or integrating factors. Let me see if I can rearrange it.

The equation is dy/dt = (t y (4 - y)) / 3. Hmm, this looks like a logistic equation but with time-dependent coefficients. Wait, no, actually, the growth rate here depends on both t and y, so it's not the standard logistic equation. Hmm, maybe I can separate variables somehow.

Let me rewrite the equation to separate y terms and t terms. So, dy/dt = (t y (4 - y)) / 3. Let's rearrange terms to get all y terms on one side and t on the other.

So, dy / [y (4 - y)] = (t / 3) dt. That looks promising. Now, I can integrate both sides.

The left side is ∫ [1/(y (4 - y))] dy. I think I can use partial fractions here. Let me set 1/(y(4-y)) = A/y + B/(4-y). Multiplying both sides by y(4-y), I get 1 = A(4 - y) + B y. Let me solve for A and B.

Expanding, 1 = 4A - A y + B y. Collecting like terms: 1 = 4A + (B - A)y. For this to hold for all y, the coefficients must satisfy:

B - A = 0 (since there's no y term on the left)
4A = 1

From the second equation, 4A = 1 => A = 1/4. Then B = A = 1/4.

So, the integral becomes ∫ (1/4)(1/y) + (1/4)(1/(4 - y)) dy. Integrating term by term, that's (1/4) ln|y| - (1/4) ln|4 - y| + C. Which can be written as (1/4) ln(y/(4 - y)) ) + C, since we're dealing with positive y values probably.

The right side is ∫ (t/3) dt, which is (1/6) t² + C.

So putting it together:

(1/4) ln(y/(4 - y)) = (1/6) t² + C.

Now, applying the initial condition y(0) = 0.5. Plugging t=0, y=0.5:

(1/4) ln(0.5/(4 - 0.5)) = (1/4) ln(0.5/3.5) = (1/4) ln(1/7) = (1/4)(-ln7).

So, the equation becomes:

(1/4) ln(y/(4 - y)) = (1/6) t² - (1/4) ln7.

Multiply both sides by 4 to simplify:

ln(y/(4 - y)) = (2/3) t² - ln7.

Exponentiating both sides to eliminate the natural log:

y/(4 - y) = e^{(2/3) t² - ln7} = e^{(2/3)t²} * e^{-ln7} = (e^{(2/3)t²}) / 7.

So,

y/(4 - y) = e^{(2/3)t²} /7.

Let's solve for y:

Multiply both sides by (4 - y):

y = (4 - y) * e^{(2/3)t²} /7.

Bring all y terms to one side:

y + y * e^{(2/3)t²} /7 = 4 e^{(2/3)t²} /7.

Factor y:

y [1 + e^{(2/3)t²}/7 ] = 4 e^{(2/3)t²} /7.

So,

y = [4 e^{(2/3)t²} /7] / [1 + e^{(2/3)t²}/7 ].

Multiply numerator and denominator by 7 to simplify:

y = [4 e^{(2/3)t²}] / [7 + e^{(2/3)t²} ].

Hmm, that's the general solution. Now, I need to find T when y(T) = 3.98.

So, set y(T) = 3.98:

3.98 = [4 e^{(2/3) T²} ] / [7 + e^{(2/3) T²} ].

Let me denote u = e^{(2/3) T²}. Then,

3.98 = (4 u) / (7 + u).

Multiply both sides by (7 + u):

3.98 (7 + u) = 4u.

Expand:

3.98*7 + 3.98 u = 4u.

Calculate 3.98*7: 3.98 *7 = 27.86.

So,

27.86 + 3.98 u = 4u.

Subtract 3.98u:

27.86 = 0.02 u.

So,

u = 27.86 / 0.02 = 1393.

But u = e^{(2/3) T²}, so:

e^{(2/3) T²} = 1393.

Take natural log of both sides:

(2/3) T² = ln(1393).

Calculate ln(1393): Let me think, ln(1000)=6.907, ln(1393)=?

Well, 1393 is between e^7 (~1096) and e^7.2≈1440. Let me check:

e^7 ≈ 1096.633, e^7.2 ≈ e^(7 + 0.2) = e^7 * e^0.2 ≈ 1096.633 * 1.2214 ≈ 1096.633 * 1.2214 ≈ 1337. So, 1393 is a bit higher.

So ln(1393) ≈ 7.22.

But let me compute more accurately. Let me use a calculator approach:

We know that ln(1393) ≈ ?

Let me compute ln(1393):

Let's use the approximation that ln(a) ≈ ln(b) + (a-b)/b for a close to b.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute it step by step.

But maybe I can just compute it as ln(1393) = ln(1393). Let me think: e^7=1096, e^7.2≈1440 as above.

Wait, 1393 is between e^7.15 and e^7.15?

Wait, let me compute 7.15:

e^7.15 = e^7 * e^0.15.

e^0.15 ≈ 1 + 0.15 + 0.0225 + 0.003375 + ... ≈ Let's compute up to the third term: 1 + 0.15 + 0.0225 + 0.0016875 ≈ 1.1741875.

Wait, actually, e^0.15 is approximately 1.161834242.

So, e^7.15 ≈ 1096.633 * 1.161834 ≈ let's compute that:

1096.633 * 1.161834 ≈

First, 1000 * 1.161834 = 1161.834.

96.633 * 1.161834 ≈ let's compute 96 * 1.161834 = 111.466, and 0.633 *1.161834≈ 0.736. So total ≈ 111.466 + 0.736 ≈ 112.202.

So total e^7.15 ≈ 1161.834 + 112.202 ≈ 1274.036.

But 1393 is higher than that. Let's try 7.2:

e^7.2 ≈ e^7 * e^0.2 ≈ 1096.633 * 1.221402758 ≈ 1096.633 * 1.2214 ≈

1096.633 *1 = 1096.633

1096.633 *0.2 = 219.3266

1096.633 *0.02=21.93266

1096.633 *0.0014≈1.535

So adding up: 1096.633 + 219.3266 = 1315.9596 +21.93266=1337.892 +1.535≈1339.427.

But 1339.427 is less than 1393. So, e^7.2≈1339.427.

Wait, but 1393 is higher than 1339.427. So let's check e^7.25.

Compute e^7.25 = e^(7.2 + 0.05) = e^7.2 * e^0.05.

e^0.05 ≈ 1 + 0.05 + 0.00125 + 0.0000208 ≈ 1.051271.

So e^7.25 ≈ 1339.427 * 1.051271 ≈

1339.427 *1 =1339.427

1339.427 *0.05=66.97135

1339.427 *0.001271≈1.701

Adding up: 1339.427 +66.97135=1406.398 +1.701≈1408.099.

So e^7.25≈1408.1. But 1393 is less than that. So ln(1393) is between 7.2 and 7.25.

Let me find a more accurate value. Let me denote x = ln(1393). We have e^x =1393.

Since e^7.2≈1339.427 and e^7.25≈1408.1.

Let me compute 7.2 + d, where e^(7.2 +d)=1393.

Using linear approximation around x=7.2:

e^(7.2 +d) ≈ e^7.2 (1 + d) = 1339.427*(1 +d).

Set this equal to 1393:

1339.427*(1 +d) ≈1393 → 1 +d ≈1393/1339.427 ≈1.0396.

So d≈0.0396.

Thus, x≈7.2 +0.0396=7.2396.

So ln(1393)≈7.2396.

Thus, back to (2/3) T² = ln(1393)=7.2396 → T² = (7.2396 *3)/2= (21.7188)/2=10.8594 → T= sqrt(10.8594).

Compute sqrt(10.8594). We know that 3^2=9, 3.2^2=10.24, 3.3^2=10.89.

So sqrt(10.8594) is between 3.3 and 3.2.

Compute 3.3^2=10.89, which is slightly higher than 10.8594.

Compute 3.29^2= (3.3 -0.01)^2= 10.89 - 2*3.3*0.01 +0.0001=10.89 -0.066 +0.0001≈10.8241.

Hmm, 3.29^2≈10.8241, 3.3^2=10.89.

We have T²=10.8594. So between 3.29 and 3.3.

Let me compute 3.295^2: Let's see, 3.295^2=?

3.295 = 3 + 0.295.

(3 + 0.295)^2 = 9 + 2*3*0.295 + 0.295^2 =9 +1.77 +0.087025=10.857025.

Hmm, that's very close to 10.8594.

So 3.295^2≈10.857025, which is just a bit less than 10.8594.

The difference is 10.8594 -10.857025=0.002375.

So, how much more than 3.295 do we need to get 0.002375 more in the square?

Let me use linear approximation. Let x=3.295, f(x)=x²=10.857025.

We want f(x + Δx)=10.8594. So Δx ≈ (10.8594 -10.857025)/(2x)=0.002375/(2*3.295)=0.002375/(6.59)=≈0.0003606.

So x≈3.295 + 0.0003606≈3.29536.

So T≈3.29536. Looking at the options, option G is 3.29527, which is very close. So the answer should be G.

The solution involves solving the differential equation using separation of variables and partial fractions, leading to the general solution. Substituting the initial condition and solving for the constant, we find the specific solution. Setting y = 3.98 and solving for t involves exponentials and logarithms, resulting in t ≈ 3.295, which corresponds to option G.
