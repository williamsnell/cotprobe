Question:

A man and a woman conspired together to rob a bank. As they were exiting the bank after the robbery they were confronted by armed tactical police officers. The man raised his gun at the officers and a flurry of shots followed. The man was injured but survived; the woman co-conspirator died from a police officer's bullet. The authorities charged the man with felony-murder of the woman. He was convicted and appealed. Under the prevailing modern view of felony murder, will the appellate court likely reverse the first-degree murder conviction?

Options:

A: Yes, because the felony murder rule only applies when the defendant is the one who directly causes the death.
B: Yes, because the police officer who shot the woman should be the one charged with murder, not the man.
C: No, because felony murder applies regardless of who fires the fatal shot as long as a death occurred during the commission of the felony.
D: No, because the man's decision to raise his gun at the officers instigated the shooting, making him responsible for the woman's death.
E: No, because all states recognize that felony murder applies to any deaths that occur during the commission of the crime regardless of who fired the fatal shot.
F: Yes, because the felony murder rule has been declared unconstitutional.
G: Yes, because the woman was a co-conspirator, not a victim of the crime, and therefore her death does not qualify as a felony murder.
H: No, because the man started the flurry of shots instead of surrendering; he caused the woman's death and is guilty of first degree murder.
I: Yes, because the majority view is that felony murder does not apply if a co-conspirator is killed by a third person during the commission of the crime.
J: No, because the man was part of the crime and his actions led directly to the woman's death.

Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is about felony murder, and whether the appellate court will reverse the conviction. Let me break it down.

First, the scenario: a man and a woman conspired to rob a bank. They were exiting when police confronted them. The man raised his gun, shots were fired, he was injured but survived, and the woman died from a police bullet. The man was charged with felony murder and convicted.

The question is about the modern view of felony murder. I remember that felony murder is when a death occurs during the commission of a felony, and the defendant can be charged with murder even if they didn't intend to kill. But there are different theories about it, like whether it applies if the killing is by someone else.

So, the options say different things. Let's look at the options one by one.

Option A says the felony murder rule only applies if the defendant caused the death directly. I think that's more aligned with the "proximate cause" or perhaps a subjective approach, but modern views might be broader. So maybe A is incorrect because felony murder doesn't require direct causation.

Option B suggests the police officer should be charged, not the man. That doesn't seem right because the man is the one committing the felony, and the police's actions are in response. So B might be wrong.

Option C says felony murder applies regardless of who fires the shot, as long as a death occurred during the felony. That sounds familiar. I think the majority rule is that if a death happens during a felony, regardless of who did it, the felon can be charged. So C might be correct.

Option D says the man is responsible because he started the shooting. That's similar to C but adds that he instigated it. Maybe, but I think under felony murder, even if another party causes the death, the felon is still liable. So D might be correct too, but I'm not sure if it's the best answer.

Option E says all states recognize felony murder applies regardless of who shot. But I think some states have exceptions, like if the death is by a co-conspirator or a law enforcement officer, but I'm not sure. Maybe E is too broad, so it's not correct universally.

Option F claims the rule is unconstitutional. I don't recall any recent decisions declaring felony murder unconstitutional. So F is probably incorrect.

Option G says the woman was a co-conspirator, so her death doesn't count. Wait, I remember that some jurisdictions have exceptions when the victim is a co-felon. Like, if a co-conspirator dies, the other conspirator isn't liable for felony murder. But I'm not sure if that's the majority view. I think some states do have such exceptions, but others don't. So G could be a possibility, but it depends on the jurisdiction.

Option H says the man caused the woman's death by starting the shooting, so he's guilty. That seems to align with D, focusing on causation. But again, under felony murder, even if the police kill a co-conspirator, the main felon can still be charged. So H might be correct, but I'm not sure if that's the focus here.

Option I says the majority view is that felony murder doesn't apply if a co-conspirator is killed by a third party. Wait, that's similar to G. If the majority view excludes co-conspirators, then I would be correct. But I thought the majority rule includes co-conspirators, unless there's a specific exception. So I might be incorrect.

Option J says the man is guilty because his actions led to her death. That sounds like a general cause, but felony murder is about the felony itself, not necessarily the direct cause. So J's reasoning might not fit the felony murder rule.

Now, the question asks under the prevailing modern view. From what I remember, the felony murder rule traditionally applied even if the death was caused by another participant or a law enforcement officer. However, some modern jurisdictions have exceptions, especially when the death is at the hands of a co-felon or a third party like the police.

Wait, in this case, the woman was a co-conspirator, and she was shot by a police officer. So if the jurisdiction follows the majority rule, felony murder applies regardless, but if they have an exception, it might not.

Looking at the options, C says felony murder applies regardless of who fires the shot. If that's the majority view, then C is correct, and the conviction stands.

But some states have exceptions, like if the victim is a co-conspirator or if the death is by a law enforcement officer. For example, in California, the felony murder rule doesn't apply if the victim is a co-felon. So if the jurisdiction follows that, the answer would be different.

But the question says "under the prevailing modern view." I think the majority still applies felony murder even if it's a co-conspirator or a third party. So the appellate court would not reverse, so the answer would be C or D or H or E.

Wait, but another angle: the felony murder rule typically requires that the death occurs during the commission of the felony and that the death was a foreseeable result. If the police shot the woman, was that foreseeable? Well, during a robbery with a gun, the police would likely shoot back, so it's foreseeable. Thus, the man can be held liable under felony murder.

So, looking at the options again, C and H are possibilities. Option C is a broader statement that applies regardless of who shot, which aligns with the majority rule. Option H is more about the man's direct actions causing the death, which is more about standard murder liability, not felony murder specifically.

Wait, but in felony murder, the defendant doesn't need to have directly caused the death. So C seems to be the correct answer because it's about the application regardless of who fires. So the appellate court would not reverse the conviction, so the answer is C: No, because felony murder applies regardless of who fires the fatal shot as long as a death occurred during the commission of the felony.

The question revolves around the felony murder rule and whether the man's conviction will stand under the prevailing modern view. Felony murder applies when a death occurs during the commission of a felony, even if the defendant did not intend to kill. The key issue is whether the rule applies when the fatal shot is fired by a third party, such as a police officer, and whether the victim is a co-conspirator.

- **Option A**: Incorrect because felony murder does not require direct causation by the defendant.
- **Option B**: Incorrect because the police officer's actions are a response to the felony, not the basis for exoneration of the man.
- **Option C**: Correct because the majority view holds that felony murder applies regardless of who fires the fatal shot, as long as a death occurs during the felony.
- **Option D**: Similar to C but focuses on the man's actions, which is less relevant to the felony murder rule.
- **Option E**: Overly broad, as not all states apply felony murder uniformly.
- **Option F**: Incorrect, as felony murder has not been declared unconstitutional.
- **Option G**: Incorrect because some jurisdictions have exceptions for co-conspirators, but this is not the majority view.
- **Option H**: Focuses on causation, but felony murder does not require direct causation by the defendant.
- **Option I**: Incorrect because the majority view does not exclude co-conspirators killed by third parties.
- **Option J**: Incorrect because felony murder is about the felony, not the defendant's direct actions.

Under the prevailing modern view, felony murder applies regardless of who fires the fatal shot, as long as a death occurs during the commission of the felony. Therefore, the appellate court is unlikely to reverse the conviction.
