B: The CPU consists of two major functional units: Control Unit (CU) and Arithmetic Control Unit (ALU).
C: The CPU consists of four major functional units: Control Unit (CU), Arithmetic Control Unit (ALU), Internal Storage Unit (ISU), and Cache Memory.
D: The CPU consists of three major functional units: Control Unit (CU), Cache Memory, and Internal Storage Unit (ISU).
E: The CPU consists of four major functional units: Control Unit (CU), Arithmetic Control Unit (ALU), Cache Memory, and External Storage Unit (ESU).
F: The CPU consists of one major functional unit: Control Unit (CU).
G: The CPU consists of five major functional units: Control Unit (CU), Arithmetic Control Unit (ALU), Internal Storage Unit (ISU), Cache Memory, and Input/Output (I/O) Management.
H: The CPU consists of seven major functional units: Control Unit (CU), Arithmetic Control Unit (ALU), Internal Storage Unit (ISU), Cache Memory, Input/Output (I/O) Management, Data Bus, and Graphics Processing Unit (GPU).
I: The CPU consists of three major functional units: Control Unit (CU), Arithmetic Control Unit (ALU), and Internal Storage Unit (ISU).
J: The CPU consists of two major functional units: Arithmetic Control Unit (ALU) and Cache Memory.

Okay, so I've got this question about the major functional units of the CPU, and I need to choose the correct option from A to J. Hmm, I remember that the CPU is the brain of the computer, right? But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact details. Let me think this through.

First, I recall that the CPU has a few main parts. The Control Unit (CU) is definitely one because it's responsible for directing the operations. Then there's the Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU), which handles the arithmetic and logic operations. Wait, but some options refer to it as the Arithmetic Control Unit (ALU). Maybe that's a typo in the options, but I'll proceed with what's given.

I think the ALU and CU are the two primary units. But some options mention more than two. Let me go through each option:

Option A says six units: CU, ALU, ISU, Cache, I/O, Data Bus. That seems too many. I don't remember the CPU having a Data Bus as a separate unit; the bus is part of the motherboard, not the CPU itself.

Option B says two units: CU and ALU. That aligns with what I remember about the basic structure.

Option C lists four units: CU, ALU, ISU, Cache. I'm not sure about ISU and Cache being part of the CPU's major units. I thought ISU might be part of the memory hierarchy, not a major functional unit within the CPU.

Option D has three units: CU, Cache, ISU. Again, not sure about these being the major ones. Cache is part of the CPU, but ISU sounds like it's more related to memory.

Option E mentions four units: CU, ALU, Cache, and ESU. ESU is External Storage Unit, which is separate from the CPU, so that doesn't seem right.

Option F says only CU. That can't be right because the ALU is also a major part.

Option G lists five units, including I/O Management. I/O is handled by I/O controllers, not the CPU directly, so I don't think I/O Management is a major unit of the CPU.

Option H has seven units, including GPU. Wait, GPU is a separate processor, not part of the CPU. So that's not correct.

Option I says three units: CU, ALU, and ISU. ISU isn't a standard term I'm familiar with in the context of CPU units.

Option J lists two units: ALU and Cache. But where's the CU? The CU is crucial for directing operations, so J can't be right.

So, going back, the basic structure is CU and ALU as the two major units. That points to option B. The other options add more components that aren't the primary functional units of the CPU.

The CPU's major functional units are the Control Unit (CU) and the Arithmetic Control Unit (ALU). These two units are responsible for directing operations and performing arithmetic/logic tasks, respectively. Other options incorrectly include additional units that are not considered major functional units of the CPU.

Answer: B
