Question:

This question refers to the following information.
[T]he the end and measure of this power, when in every man's hands in the state of nature, being the preservation of all of his society, that is, all mankind in general, it can have no other end or measure, when in the hands of the magistrate, but to preserve the members of that society in their lives, liberties, and possessions, and so cannot be an absolute, arbitrary power over their lives and fortunes, which are as much as possible to be preserved, but a power to make law, and annex such penalties to them, as may tend to the preservation of the whole by cutting off those parts, and those only, which are so corrupt that they threaten the sound and healthy, without which no severity is lawful. And this power has its original only from compact, and agreement, and the mutual consent of those who make up the community. â€¦
Whensoever, therefore, the legislative shall transgress this fundamental rule of society; and either by ambition, fear, folly or corruption, endeavor to grasp themselves, or put into the hands of any other, an absolute power over the lives, liberties, and estates of the people; by this breach of trust they forfeit the power the people had put into their hands for quite contrary ends.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about John Locke's beliefs regarding when a government loses its legitimacy. The passage provided is from his Second Treatise of Government, written in 1690. I remember that Locke was a big influence on modern democratic thought, especially with his ideas about natural rights and the social contract.

The passage talks about the power of the magistrate, which I think refers to the government or those in authority. It says that the end and measure of this power is to preserve the members of society in their lives, liberties, and possessions. So the government's role is to protect people's rights and their property. Locke is emphasizing that the government's power isn't absolute; it's limited to preserving the society as a whole.

He mentions that this power comes from a compact, meaning an agreement or contract between the people and the rulers. The government's authority is derived from the people's consent. If the government were to misuse this power, that would be a breach of trust. Specifically, the passage says that when the legislative (the law-making body) tries to grasp absolute power over the people's lives, liberties, and estates, they forfeit their legitimacy.

Looking at the options:

A: When the people wish to change governors. Hmm, the passage isn't about changing leadership but about misuse of power. So probably not A.

B: It does not have penalties for breaking the law. The passage talks about penalties as a way to enforce laws to preserve society, but losing legitimacy isn't about lacking penalties, it's about misusing power. So B seems off.

C: It tries to exercise absolute power. This seems right because the passage clearly states that if the government tries to take absolute power, it's a breach of trust, making them illegitimate.

D: It does not have a legislative body. Locke's ideas do involve a legislative body, but the passage doesn't say the government loses legitimacy without one; it's more about misuse of existing power. So D isn't the best choice.

E: It does not enact laws. The government's role is to make laws, but the passage isn't saying that not enacting laws makes it illegitimate. It's about misusing the power to make laws.

F: It is weak and can be overthrown. The passage doesn't discuss weakness but rather about the government's misuse leading to illegitimacy, not about being overthrown.

G: The people do not follow the laws. The passage is about the government's actions, not the people's. So G doesn't fit.

So, the key point is when the government, especially the legislative, tries to take absolute power, which is a breach of trust, leading to illegitimacy. Therefore, the correct answer is C.

The passage from John Locke's Second Treatise of Government emphasizes that the government's legitimacy is tied to its role in protecting the lives, liberties, and possessions of its members. Locke argues that when the legislative body, through actions like grasping absolute power, breaches this trust, the government forfeits its legitimacy. 

Analyzing the options, the correct inference is that Locke believed a government loses its legitimacy when it attempts to exercise absolute power, as this constitutes a breach of the social contract and trust placed in it by the people.

Answer: C
