Okay, so I've got this motor problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the speed when the load is partially removed. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.

First, the motor is a 25-hp, 240-volt series motor. It's taking 93 amps at full load, running at 800 rpm. The armature resistance is 0.12 ohms, and the series-field resistance is 0.08 ohms. Now, when the load is partially removed, the current drops to 31 amps. The question is asking for the new speed.

Hmm, so I remember that in a series motor, the field and armature are connected in series. The flux is given to be reduced by 50% when the current drops by 66 2/3%. Wait, let me check that. If the current drops by 66.666%, that means the current is now one-third of the original. Because 66.666% is two-thirds, so the remaining is one-third. So, initial current was 93 amps, and now it's 31 amps, which is exactly one-third. So the flux is reduced by 50%, as stated.

I think the key here is to use the relationship between speed, flux, and current in a series motor. The speed equation for a series motor is something like:

Speed (N) is proportional to (V - IaRa) / (Φ * (Ra + Rf)), but I'm not sure. Wait, no, maybe it's better to think in terms of the formula for speed. Oh right, for a series motor, the speed is given by:

N = (V - IaRa) / (Φ * (Ra + Rf)) * (some constant, like 60π/(p), but maybe we can ignore the constant since we're dealing with ratios.)

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the speed equation can be written as N = (V - IaRa) / (Φ * Ke), where Ke is the motor constant. But perhaps a better approach is to use the formula that relates speed to current and flux.

Wait, another approach: In a series motor, the speed is inversely proportional to the flux and directly proportional to the voltage minus the armature drop. So when the flux changes, the speed changes accordingly.

Wait, let me think again. The basic formula for speed in a DC motor is N = (V - IaRa) / (Φ * (P/60)), where P is the number of poles. But without knowing P, maybe we can find the ratio.

Wait, but since we're dealing with the same motor and only changing the current and flux, perhaps we can find the speed ratio by considering the change in flux and the change in current.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me start by calculating the armature voltage drop and the back EMF at full load and then at the new current.

At full load, the current Ia1 is 93 A. The armature resistance Ra is 0.12 ohms, so the armature voltage drop V_a1 = Ia1 * Ra = 93 * 0.12 = 11.16 volts.

The applied voltage is 240 V, so the back EMF E1 is V - V_a1 = 240 - 11.16 = 228.84 V.

Similarly, when the current drops to 31 A, the armature voltage drop V_a2 = 31 * 0.12 = 3.72 V.

The back EMF E2 would then be 240 - 3.72 = 236.28 V, but wait, that doesn't make sense because the flux is reduced by 50%, so the back EMF should change accordingly.

Wait, no. The flux is reduced by 50%, so the back EMF should also change because E is proportional to Φ and speed. Hmm, maybe I'm complicating things. Let me think about the torque and speed characteristics.

Wait, in a series motor, the torque T is given by T = (Φ * Ia * (P/60)) * (something), but perhaps a better approach is to use the speed equation.

Wait, another approach: The speed of a series motor is given by N = (V - IaRa) / (Φ * (Ra + Rf)) * something, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the speed can be expressed as N = (V - IaRa) / (Φ) * (1/(Ra + Rf)).

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should use the formula for speed in terms of back EMF.

The back EMF E = V - IaRa.

And E is also equal to Φ * P * N * K, where K is some constant involving the motor's geometry. But perhaps more accurately, E = Φ * (P/60) * N * K, where K is a factor like the number of conductors or something. But without knowing P, maybe I can relate the speeds by considering the ratio of E and Φ.

So, E1 = Φ1 * (P/60) * N1.

E2 = Φ2 * (P/60) * N2.

But Φ2 is 0.5 Φ1, because the flux is reduced by 50%.

So, E2 = 0.5 Φ1 * (P/60) * N2.

But E2 is also equal to V2 - Ia2 Ra. Wait, but the applied voltage V remains the same, 240 V, because the question doesn't mention changing the voltage, just the load.

Wait, but wait, when the load is removed, the current drops, but the voltage applied is still 240 V. So, V remains 240 V.

So, E1 = V - Ia1 Ra = 240 - 93*0.12 = 240 - 11.16 = 228.84 V.

E2 = V - Ia2 Ra = 240 - 31 * 0.12 = 240 - 3.72 = 236.28 V.

Wait, that's strange because when the flux is reduced by 50%, the back EMF should be lower, but here E2 is higher than E1, which doesn't make sense. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, no, because when the flux is reduced, the back EMF would be lower if the speed is the same, but in this case, the speed is changing. So perhaps I should relate E1 and E2 through the flux and the speed.

From the two equations:

E1 = Φ1 * (P/60) * N1.

E2 = Φ2 * (P/60) * N2.

But Φ2 = 0.5 Φ1.

So, E2 = 0.5 Φ1 * (P/60) * N2.

But E1 = Φ1 * (P/60) * N1.

So, we can write E2 = 0.5 * (E1 / N1) * N2.

Because E1 = Φ1 * (P/60) * N1 → Φ1 = E1 / ( (P/60) * N1 )

Substituting into E2:

E2 = 0.5 * (E1 / ( (P/60) * N1 )) * (P/60) * N2 )

Wait, that's a bit messy, but simplifying, E2 = 0.5 * E1 * (N2 / N1).

So, E2 = 0.5 E1 (N2 / N1).

But we also have E2 = V - Ia2 Ra = 236.28 V.

E1 = 228.84 V.

So, 236.28 = 0.5 * 228.84 * (N2 / 800).

Let me compute that.

0.5 * 228.84 = 114.42.

So,

236.28 = 114.42 * (N2 / 800).

Divide both sides by 114.42:

236.28 / 114.42 ≈ 2.068.

So,

2.068 = N2 / 800.

So,

N2 ≈ 800 * 2.068 ≈ 1654.4 rpm.

Hmm, that's about 1654 rpm. But the options don't have exactly that. Let me check the options again.

Options are:

A: 2,100

B: 950

C:1,400

D:1,800

E:800

F:1,550

G:2,000

H:2,500

I:1,690

J:1,200

Wait, 1654 is close to option I (1,690), but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Let me try a different method.

In a series motor, when the current changes, the flux changes, and the speed changes. The speed is proportional to (V - Ia Ra) / Φ.

But since Φ is proportional to the current (because flux is generated by the field current, which in a series motor is the same as armature current), but wait, in a series motor, the field and armature are in series, so the current through the field is the same as the armature current. So, the flux Φ is proportional to Ia, because flux (Φ) is proportional to the field current (Ia), assuming the field resistance is constant.

Wait, but the problem states that the flux is reduced by 50% for a current drop of 66 2/3%. So, when current drops to one-third (from 93 to 31 A, which is exactly one-third), the flux is halved.

So, the flux is Φ = k * Ia, where k is a constant. So, Φ1 = k * 93, Φ2 = k *31 = 0.5 * Φ1.

Wait, because 31 is one-third of 93, and 0.5 * 93 is 46.5, which is not 31. So perhaps my initial understanding is incorrect. Maybe the flux is reduced by 50% when the current drops by 66 2/3%, which is a 2/3 drop. So, when current is 31 A (which is 1/3 of 93), the flux is reduced by 50%.

So, Φ2 = 0.5 Φ1.

Now, the speed of a series motor is given by:

N ∝ (V - Ia Ra) / Φ.

Because the field resistance is in series, but the field current is Ia, so Φ = Ia * R_field? Wait, no, the field flux is generated by the field current, which is the same as Ia in a series motor. So, the flux Φ is proportional to Ia (since Φ = Ia * R_field * something?), but perhaps it's better to model it as Φ = k * Ia, where k is a constant.

So, the speed equation can be written as:

N = (V - Ia Ra) / (Φ) * C,

where C is a constant that includes the motor's construction factors.

So, since Φ is proportional to Ia, we can write:

N ∝ (V - Ia Ra) / Ia.

Because Φ = k Ia, so N ∝ (V - Ia Ra) / (k Ia) → N ∝ (V/Ia - Ra).

Wait, that's interesting. So, N is proportional to (V/Ia - Ra).

In that case, when Ia changes, N changes based on that.

At full load, Ia1 = 93 A.

So, N1 = (240 / 93 - 0.12) * K.

Wait, 240/93 is approximately 2.5806, minus 0.12 gives about 2.4606, multiplied by K gives N1 = 800 rpm.

At the new current, Ia2 = 31 A.

So, N2 = (240 /31 - 0.12) * K.

Compute 240/31: 31 * 7 = 217, 31*7.7419 ≈ 240 → 7.7419.

So, 240/31 ≈7.7419, minus 0.12 →7.6219.

So, N2 =7.6219 * K.

But N1 =2.4606 * K =800 rpm.

So, K =800 / 2.4606 ≈ 324.22.

Then N2 =7.6219 * 324.22 ≈ let's compute that.

7 * 324 = 2268.

0.6219 *324 ≈ 201. So, total around 2268 + 201 ≈ 2469? That can't be right because the options don't go that high, and the flux is reduced, which should affect the speed differently.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should approach this differently.

Another approach: The speed of a series motor is given by:

N = (V - Ia Ra) / (Φ * (Ra + Rf)) * (something with poles), but without knowing the number of poles, perhaps we can relate the two speeds using the ratio.

Let me denote:

At full load: Ia1 =93 A, Φ1 = k * Ia1.

At partial load: Ia2=31 A, Φ2=0.5 Φ1 = 0.5 k *93.

Wait, but Φ2 is 0.5 Φ1, as given.

So, the speed ratio N2/N1 = [(V - Ia2 Ra)/(Φ2)] / [(V - Ia1 Ra)/Φ1] 

Because N ∝ (V - Ia Ra)/Φ.

So,

N2/N1 = [ (V - Ia2 Ra) / Φ2 ] / [ (V - Ia1 Ra)/Φ1 ]

= [ (V - Ia2 Ra) / (0.5 Φ1) ] * [ Φ1 / (V - Ia1 Ra) ) ]

= [ (V - Ia2 Ra) / (0.5 (V - Ia1 Ra)) ) ]

Because Φ1 cancels out.

So,

N2/N1 = 2 * (V - Ia2 Ra) / (V - Ia1 Ra).

Plugging in the numbers:

V =240 V.

Ia1 =93 A → V - Ia1 Ra =240 -93 *0.12=240 -11.16=228.84 V.

Ia2=31 A → V - Ia2 Ra=240 -31 *0.12=240-3.72=236.28 V.

So,

N2/N1 = 2 * (236.28) / (228.84) ≈ 2 * (236.28 / 228.84).

Compute 236.28 / 228.84 ≈1.0324.

So,

N2/N1 ≈ 2 *1.0324 ≈2.0648.

Since N1 is 800 rpm,

N2≈800 *2.0648≈1651.84 rpm.

Looking at the options, the closest is option I: 1690 rpm, but that's a bit higher. Alternatively, perhaps I made a calculation error.

Wait, let me double-check the numbers.

Compute 236.28/228.84:

Divide numerator and denominator by 12: 236.28 ÷12=19.69, 228.84 ÷12=19.07.

So, approx 19.69/19.07≈1.032.

So, 2*1.032=2.064.

800 *2.064=1651.2 rpm.

Hmm, but the options don't have 1651. So perhaps I made a wrong assumption.

Wait, the problem says that the brush drop is 2 volts at both loads. Oh, right! I forgot about that. So, the applied voltage isn't just 240 V minus the armature drop; we also have to subtract the brush drop. So, the actual voltage available for the back EMF is V - Ia Ra - brush drop.

Wait, brush drop is typically a voltage drop due to the commutator and brushes, usually around 2-3 volts. Here, it's given as 2 volts for both loads. So, the total voltage considered for back EMF is V - Ia Ra - brush drop.

So, I need to adjust the calculations to include the brush drop.

So, let me recalculate E1 and E2 with brush drop.

At full load:

E1 = V - Ia1 Ra - brush drop =240 -93*0.12 -2=240-11.16-2=226.84 V.

At partial load:

E2=240 -31*0.12 -2=240-3.72-2=234.28 V.

Now, using the speed ratio again:

N2/N1=2*(E2)/(E1) * (Φ1)/(Φ2).

Wait, no, earlier we had Φ2=0.5 Φ1, so Φ1/Φ2=2.

Wait, earlier approach:

N2/N1= [ (V - Ia2 Ra - brush) / Φ2 ] / [ (V - Ia1 Ra - brush) / Φ1 ]

= [ (E2) / Φ2 ] / [ (E1) / Φ1 ]

= [ E2 / (0.5 Φ1) ] / [ E1 / Φ1 ]

= (2 E2) / E1.

So,

N2/N1=2*(E2/E1).

E2=234.28, E1=226.84.

So,

N2/N1= 2*(234.28/226.84) ≈2*(1.0328)≈2.0656.

Thus,

N2=800 *2.0656≈1652.5 rpm.

Still around 1652, which is not exactly an option. The closest option is I:1690 rpm. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, another way: Let's consider the torque and speed relationship. Since the motor is a series motor, the speed is inversely proportional to the torque, but that's only at a given current or something else.

Alternatively, the power at the shaft is P = (V - Ia Ra - brush drop) * Ia * efficiency.

But maybe that's complicating things.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects us to use the speed formula considering the change in flux and current, without considering the exact ratios, but using the given percentages.

Wait, the problem states that the flux is reduced by 50% for a current drop of 66 2/3%. So when current drops to 31 A (from 93 A), which is a drop of 66.666%, the flux is halved.

So, the flux is now 0.5 Φ.

Now, the speed of a series motor is given by N = (V - Ia Ra) / (Φ * (Ra + Rf)) * (some constant).

Wait, but without knowing the exact formula, perhaps it's better to consider the speed ratio.

The speed is inversely proportional to flux and directly proportional to (V - Ia Ra).

So, N ∝ (V - Ia Ra)/Φ.

At full load:

N1 = (240 -93*0.12 -2) / Φ1 = (240 -11.16 -2)/Φ1 =226.84 /Φ1.

At partial load:

N2= (240 -31*0.12 -2)/ (0.5 Φ1) = (240 -3.72 -2)/(0.5 Φ1)=234.28/(0.5 Φ1)=468.56/Φ1.

So, the ratio N2/N1= (468.56/Φ1) / (226.84/Φ1) )=468.56 /226.84≈2.065.

So, N2≈800 *2.065≈1652 rpm.

Again, same result. Since none of the options exactly match 1652, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the formula is different. Let me think again.

In a series motor, the speed is given by:

N = (V - Ia Ra) / (Φ * (Ra + Rf)) * (P/60) * 60/(2π) ?

Wait, maybe the correct formula is:

N = (V - Ia (Ra + Rf)) / (Φ * (P/2π)).

But without knowing P, perhaps we can't use it. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to use the fact that the speed is inversely proportional to the flux and directly proportional to the back EMF.

So, E = V - Ia Ra - brush drop.

Then, E ∝ Φ * N.

So, E1 = Φ1 * N1 * k.

E2 = Φ2 * N2 *k.

Dividing E2 by E1:

E2/E1 = (Φ2/Φ1) * (N2/N1).

We know Φ2=0.5 Φ1, so:

E2/E1=0.5 * (N2/N1).

Rearranging:

N2/N1 = 2*(E2/E1).

So,

N2= N1 * 2*(E2/E1).

E1=226.84, E2=234.28.

So,

N2=800 *2*(234.28/226.84)=800*2*(1.0328)=800*2.0656≈1652.5 rpm.

Again, same result. So, perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but the closest option is I: 1690 rpm. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the initial assumption about the flux being halved is incorrect. Let me check the problem statement again.

The problem says: "Assume that the flux is reduced by 50 percent for a current drop of 66 2/3 percent and that the brushdrop is 2 volts at both loads."

So, when current drops by 66 2/3%, it's 2/3 drop, so current is 1/3, which is 31 A. So, flux is halved.

Yes, that seems correct.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the armature resistance includes the series field resistance? Or are they separate?

Wait, the armature resistance is given as 0.12 ohms, and the series-field resistance is 0.08 ohms. So, the total resistance when the motor is running is Ra + Rf.

So, when calculating the armature voltage drop, it's Ia * Ra, and the field voltage drop is Ia * Rf.

So, the total voltage drop is Ia (Ra + Rf), and the back EMF is V - Ia (Ra + Rf) - brush drop.

Wait, that's a different approach. So, perhaps I should calculate the total voltage drop as Ia*(Ra + Rf).

Let me try this approach.

At full load:

Ia1=93 A.

Total voltage drop V_drop1=93*(0.12+0.08)=93*0.2=18.6 V.

So, back EMF E1=V - V_drop1 - brush drop=240 -18.6 -2=219.4 V.

At partial load:

Ia2=31 A.

V_drop2=31*(0.12+0.08)=31*0.2=6.2 V.

E2=240 -6.2 -2=231.8 V.

Now, using the speed ratio:

N2/N1= (E2 / Φ2) / (E1 / Φ1 )= (E2 / (0.5 Φ1 )) / (E1 / Φ1 )= 2 E2 / E1.

So,

N2= N1 *2*(E2/E1)=800 *2*(231.8/219.4).

Compute 231.8/219.4≈1.057.

So,

N2=800*2*1.057≈800*2.114≈1691.2 rpm.

Ah, that's approximately 1691 rpm, which matches option I:1,690 rpm.

So, the correct answer should be I.
</think>

To determine the speed of the series motor when the load is partially removed, we analyze the relationship between speed, flux, and current. The motor's speed is inversely proportional to the flux and directly proportional to the back EMF. The back EMF is calculated as:

\[
E = V - I_a (R_a + R_f) - \text{brush drop}
\]

### Step 1: Calculate Back EMF at Full Load
- **Current**: \( I_{a1} = 93 \, \text{A} \)
- **Voltage**: \( V = 240 \, \text{V} \)
- **Armature resistance**: \( R_a = 0.12 \, \Omega \)
- **Field resistance**: \( R_f = 0.08 \, \Omega \)
- **Brush drop**: \( 2 \, \text{V} \)

Total voltage drop:
\[
V_{\text{drop1}} = I_{a1} (R_a + R_f) = 93 \times (0.12 + 0.08) = 18.6 \, \text{V}
\]

Back EMF:
\[
E_1 = V - V_{\text{drop1}} - \text{brush drop} = 240 - 18.6 - 2 = 219.4 \, \text{V}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate Back EMF at Partial Load
- **Current**: \( I_{a2} = 31 \, \text{A} \)

Total voltage drop:
\[
V_{\text{drop2}} = I_{a2} (R_a + R_f) = 31 \times (0.12 + 0.08) = 6.2 \, \text{V}
\]

Back EMF:
\[
E_2 = V - V_{\text{drop2}} - \text{brush drop} = 240 - 6.2 - 2 = 231.8 \, \text{V}
\]

### Step 3: Relate Speeds Using Flux and Back EMF
The flux is reduced by 50% when the current drops by 66.67% (from 93 A to 31 A). Thus:
\[
\Phi_2 = 0.5 \Phi_1
\]

The speed ratio is given by:
\[
\frac{N_2}{N_1} = \frac{E_2 / \Phi_2}{E_1 / \Phi_1} = \frac{E_2}{0.5 \Phi_1} \cdot \frac{\Phi_1}{E_1} = \frac{2 E_2}{E_1}
\]

Substitute the values:
\[
\frac{N_2}{N_1} = \frac{2 \times 231.8}{219.4} \approx 2.114
\]

\[
N_2 = N_1 \times 2.114 = 800 \times 2.114 \approx 1691 \, \text{rpm}
\]

### Step 4: Match the Closest Option
The calculated speed is approximately \( 1691 \, \text{rpm} \), which corresponds to option **I: 1,690 rpm**.

ANSWER: I
