Question:

If four firms in a competitive industry have supply schedules givenby the following equations: Q_1^S = 16 + 4PQ_3^S = 32 + 8P Q_2^S = 5 - 5PQ_4^S = 60 - 10P What is their combined supply?

Options:

A: Q^S_total= 113 - 5P
B: Q^S_total = 108 - 6P
C: Q^S_total = 120 + 0P
D: Q^S_total = 116 + 2P
E: Q^S_total= 113 - 3P
F: Q^S_total= 113 + 3P
G: Q^S_total = 115 - 7P
H: Q^S_total = 111 + 7P
I: Q^S_total= 113 + 5P
J: Q^S_total = 118 - 2P

Okay, so I've got this economics problem here about supply schedules for four firms in a competitive industry. The question is asking for their combined supply. Hmm, I remember that in a competitive market, each firm's supply is individual, and the total supply is just the sum of all their individual supplies. 

Let me look at the given equations again:

Q₁^S = 16 + 4P  
Q₂^S = 5 - 5P  
Q₃^S = 32 + 8P  
Q₄^S = 60 - 10P  

Wait, wait a minute. I think I might have misread that. Oh no, the second firm's supply is Q₂^S = 5 - 5P. That seems a bit odd because usually, supply curves slope upward, meaning as P increases, Q supplied increases. But Q₂^S has a negative coefficient for P. That would mean as P increases, the firm might actually supply less, which doesn't make sense unless maybe the firm is a monopolist or something, but in a competitive industry, I think all firms should have upward-sloping supply curves. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, no, maybe I'm just overcomplicating. The question is just about adding up their individual supply functions to get the total supply. So regardless of whether each individual firm's supply makes economic sense, I should just add them up as given.

So, let's proceed step by step. I'll write each Q^S as a function of P and then sum them all.

Q₁^S = 16 + 4P  
Q₂^S = 5 - 5P  
Q₃^S = 32 + 8P  
Q₄^S = 60 - 10P  

Adding these together:

Total Q^S = (16 + 5 + 32 + 60) + (4P -5P +8P -10P)

Let me calculate the constants first: 16 +5 is 21, plus 32 is 53, plus 60 is 113.

Now for the coefficients of P: 4P -5P is -1P, plus 8P is 7P, minus 10P is -3P.

So total Q^S = 113 -3P.

Looking at the options, option E is Q^S_total = 113 -3P. That should be the correct answer.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

Adding the constants: 16 +5=21, 21+32=53, 53+60=113. Yep, that's correct.

For the P terms: 4P -5P is -1P. Then -1P +8P is 7P. 7P -10P is -3P. So the total is 113 -3P.

Yes, that looks right. So the combined supply is 113 -3P, which matches option E.

The combined supply is calculated by adding each firm's supply equations. Summing the constants gives 113, and combining the coefficients of P results in -3P. Thus, the total supply is 113 - 3P, corresponding to option E.

Answer: E
