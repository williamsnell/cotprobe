Question:

A buyer filed a lawsuit against a seller based on a written contract allegedly executed at the time of the sale of the seller's hot dog stand to the buyer. Under the terms of the contract, the seller agreed not to open a hot dog stand for a period of two years within a distance of two miles of the old hot dog stand, now owned by the buyer. The buyer alleged in his complaint that the seller violated the contract by opening a hot dog stand one-half mile from the old location. The original contract was lost prior to trial. At trial, the buyer wants to introduce a duplicate carbon copy of the written contract. The seller objects as to the authenticity of the original written contract. The copy is

Options:

A: admissible, because the original contract was lost.
B: inadmissible, unless the seller admits to the authenticity of the duplicate.
C: inadmissible, because the seller did not sign or acknowledge the duplicate.
D: inadmissible, because the best evidence rule requires that the original contract always be used as evidence.
E: admissible, because the duplicate is a carbon copy.
F: inadmissible, because the duplicate might be a forgery.
G: admissible, only if the buyer can provide witnesses to confirm the authenticity of the duplicate.
H: admissible, if the court can confirm the fairness of the contract.
I: admissible, because the duplicate has the same legal value as the original contract.
J: inadmissible, because the seller contests the authenticity of the written contract.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this evidence question about a contract. Let's see what the situation is.

The buyer is suing the seller because they claim the seller opened a hot dog stand too close, violating their contract. The contract was written and agreed upon at the time of sale. The buyer wants to introduce a duplicate carbon copy of the contract because the original was lost. The seller is objecting, saying the original isn't authentic.

Hmm, I remember something about the best evidence rule. The best evidence rule, also known as the original writing rule, says that to prove the content of a writing, the original document should be produced. But there are exceptions, right?

So the question is, is the duplicate carbon copy admissible? The options suggest different rules.

Option A says it's admissible because the original was lost. I think under the best evidence rule, if the original is lost or destroyed without bad faith, the duplicate might be admissible. But I'm not sure if losing it is enough.

Option B says it's inadmissible unless the seller admits it. That doesn't sound right because the seller's objection is about authenticity, not necessarily admission.

Option C says it's inadmissible because the seller didn't sign the duplicate. Well, the seller signed the original, but the copy isn't signed. Wait, but the copy is a carbon, so it's a copy of the original. The signature would be on the original, but the copy might not have it. But I'm not sure if that matters here.

Option D says it's inadmissible because the best evidence rule requires the original. That's the general rule, but there are exceptions. So maybe this isn't the right answer.

Option E: Admissible because it's a carbon copy. I think a carbon copy is considered a duplicate, but under the best evidence rule, unless an exception applies, it's not admissible.

Option F: Inadmissible because it might be a forgery. Well, the seller is contesting the authenticity, so the court would need to determine if the copy is genuine. But the question is about admissibility, not its truthfulness. So the copy can come in for the jury to decide, but the court might exclude it if there's a foundation issue.

Option G: Admissible only if the buyer can provide witnesses. That seems like it's about authentication, not just the best evidence. So maybe if the buyer can prove the copy is accurate, but the question doesn't say if they can.

Option H: Admissible if the court confirms fairness. That doesn't make sense; the court isn't there to confirm the fairness but to let the jury decide.

Option I: Admissible because the duplicate has the same legal value. I'm not sure about that. The original has legal value, but a duplicate might not unless an exception applies.

Option J: Inadmissible because the seller contests authenticity. Wait, the best evidence rule is about proving the content, not necessarily about authenticity. If the content is in question, the original is needed unless an exception applies.

So, thinking about exceptions to the best evidence rule. One exception is when the original is lost or destroyed. But the party must show that they tried to get the original and couldn't, and that they didn't lose it negligently.

In the question, the original was lost before trial. The buyer is trying to use a carbon copy. So, under the best evidence rule, the original should be used, but if it's lost, then a duplicate might be admissible.

Wait, but the best evidence rule requires the original unless there's an exception. So the buyer would need to show that the original is lost, and that they made a reasonable effort to get it. If they can do that, then the duplicate might be admissible.

Looking at the options, option A says it's admissible because the original was lost. So if the buyer can prove the original is lost, then the duplicate is admissible.

But I'm a bit confused because the seller is objecting to the authenticity. So maybe the issue is not just the best evidence rule but also whether the copy is authentic. The best evidence rule is about the content, but the opposing party can challenge the authenticity of the copy.

Wait, but the best evidence rule is about proving the content of a writing. If the copy is a true duplicate, then it can be used under the best evidence exception when the original is lost. But if the copy's authenticity is in question, the opposing party can attack it, but it doesn't automatically make it inadmissible.

So, the buyer can offer the duplicate if the original is lost and they've made an effort to get it. The seller's objection about authenticity would go to the weight of the evidence, not its admissibility. So the copy should be admissible under the best evidence exception.

Looking back at the options:

Option A: Admissible because original was lost. That seems correct if the buyer meets the requirements.

Option D says it's inadmissible because the original is required. But that's only if there's no exception.

So, the answer should be A.
</think>

The buyer is seeking to admit a duplicate carbon copy of a lost contract under the best evidence rule. While the best evidence rule generally requires the original document, exceptions apply when the original is lost. If the buyer can show the original was lost and they made a reasonable effort to obtain it, the duplicate may be admissible. The seller's objection to authenticity goes to the weight, not admissibility. Therefore, the duplicate is admissible.
