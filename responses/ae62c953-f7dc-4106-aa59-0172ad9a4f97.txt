Okay, so I've got this fluid mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the vorticity for each of the two flows given. I'm a bit new to this, so I need to take it step by step. Let me start by recalling what I know about vorticity.

Vorticity is a measure of the local rotation of fluid particles. It's defined as the curl of the velocity vector field. So, mathematically, vorticity ω is ∇ × v. In fluid dynamics, if the vorticity is zero, the flow is irrotational; otherwise, it's rotational.

The problem gives me two velocity fields:

(a) v_t = 6r, v_r = 0
(b) v_t = 0, v_r = -5/r

Wait, I think the notation here is cylindrical coordinates since v_t and v_r are mentioned. In cylindrical coordinates (r, θ, z), v_r is the radial component, v_θ is the tangential (or circumferential) component, and v_z is the axial component. But in both cases, maybe v_z is zero? The problem doesn't mention v_z, so perhaps it's zero for both flows.

So, for each flow, I'll compute the curl in cylindrical coordinates. The curl in cylindrical coordinates is given by:

∇ × v = (1/r)(∂v_z/∂θ - ∂v_θ/∂z) i_r
        + (∂v_r/∂z - ∂v_z/∂r) i_θ
        + (1/r)(∂(r v_θ)/∂r - ∂v_r/∂θ) i_z

But since the flows are in cylindrical coordinates and the velocity fields don't mention z or depend on it, I'm assuming that all derivatives with respect to z are zero. Also, since v_r and v_θ don't depend on θ, the ∂v_r/∂θ and ∂v_θ/∂θ terms would be zero. Wait, no, wait: in this case, for each part (a) and (b), let's see.

Starting with part (a): v_t = 6r. Hmm, wait, wait. Wait, v_t is probably v_θ, right? Because in the problem statement, they wrote v_t and v_r. So v_θ is 6r, and v_r is 0. Also, v_z is zero because it's not mentioned.

So, for flow (a), velocity components are:
v_r = 0,
v_θ = 6r,
v_z = 0.

Similarly, for part (b):
v_θ = 0,
v_r = -5/r,
v_z = 0.

So, let's compute the curl for each.

First, for flow (a):

v_r = 0,
v_θ = 6r,
v_z = 0.

Compute each component of the curl:

i_r component: (1/r)(∂v_z/∂θ - ∂v_θ/∂z). Since v_z = 0 and v_θ depends only on r, not z, and ∂v_θ/∂z = 0. So this term is zero.

i_θ component: (∂v_r/∂z - ∂v_z/∂r). Both are zero because v_r and v_z are functions of r only, and their derivatives with respect to z are zero. So this is zero.

i_z component: (1/r)(∂(r v_θ)/∂r - ∂v_r/∂θ). Let's compute ∂(r v_θ)/∂r. r v_θ = r*(6r) = 6r². So ∂(6r²)/∂r = 12r. Then, ∂v_r/∂θ is ∂(0)/∂θ = 0. So the i_z component is (1/r)(12r - 0) ) = 12.

So the curl is (0, 0, 12), which means the vorticity is 12 in the z-direction. So the vorticity vector is (0, 0, 12), and since it's non-zero, the flow is rotational with vorticity 12.

Wait, but wait, in cylindrical coordinates, when we write the vorticity, we usually express it in the z-component because the rotation is around the z-axis. So for flow (a), the vorticity is 12. So flow (a) is rotational with vorticity 12.

Now, for flow (b):

v_r = -5/r,
v_θ = 0,
v_z = 0.

Compute the curl components.

i_r component: (1/r)(∂v_z/∂θ - ∂v_θ/∂z). Both terms are zero because v_z is zero and v_θ is zero. So this is zero.

i_θ component: (∂v_r/∂z - ∂v_z/∂r). Both are zero, as before.

i_z component: (1/r)(∂(r v_θ)/∂r - ∂v_r/∂θ). Let's compute each part.

r v_θ = r * 0 = 0. So ∂(0)/∂r = 0.

∂v_r/∂θ: v_r is -5/r, which doesn't depend on θ, so this derivative is zero.

So the i_z component is (1/r)(0 - 0) = 0.

So the curl is zero vector, which implies the vorticity is zero. Therefore, flow (b) is irrotational with vorticity 0.

Wait, but wait, I might have made a mistake here. Let me double-check. Because sometimes, for irrotational flows, even if the curl is zero, you can have a velocity field that's the gradient of a scalar potential. But wait, in this case, v_r is -5/r, and v_θ=0, v_z=0.

Wait, another way to think: in cylindrical coordinates, if the curl is zero, then the flow is irrotational. So for flow (b), the curl is zero, so vorticity is zero. So flow (b) is irrotational.

Looking back at the options, let's see which option matches this.

Looking at the options:

Option D: Flow (a) is irrotational with vorticity 0, Flow (b) is rotational with vorticity 12. No, that's the opposite.

Option C: Flow (a) is rotational with vorticity 12, Flow (b) is irrotational with vorticity 0. That matches what I found.

So the correct answer would be option C.

Wait, wait, let me check the options again.

Option C: Flow (a) is rotational with a vorticity of 12, Flow (b) is irrotational with a vorticity of 0.

Yes, that's what I concluded. So option C is correct.

Wait, but wait, did I compute the curl correctly for part (a)? Let me go through it again.

For flow (a), v_θ = 6r, v_r = 0.

The i_z component of the curl is (1/r)(∂(r v_θ)/∂r - ∂v_r/∂θ).

r v_θ = r * 6r = 6 r².

∂(6 r²)/∂r = 12 r.

∂v_r/∂θ = 0.

So (1/r)(12 r - 0) = 12. So yes, the vorticity is 12.

So flow (a) is rotational with vorticity 12, and flow (b) is irrotational with vorticity 0. So the correct option is option C.

The vorticity of a flow is determined by computing the curl of the velocity field. For flow (a), the velocity components are \(v_r = 0\), \(v_\theta = 6r\), and \(v_z = 0\). The curl in cylindrical coordinates gives a non-zero vorticity of 12, indicating a rotational flow. For flow (b), the velocity components are \(v_r = -5/r\), \(v_\theta = 0\), and \(v_z = 0\). The curl yields a zero vorticity, indicating an irrotational flow. Thus, flow (a) is rotational with vorticity 12, and flow (b) is irrotational with vorticity 0.
