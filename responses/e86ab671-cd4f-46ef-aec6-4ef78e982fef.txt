Okay, so I've got this question about Taurek's claims, and I need to figure it out. Let me start by recalling what I know about Taurek. I think he's a philosopher who has written about ethics and moral theory, particularly in the context of trolley problems and utilitarianism. 

The question is asking what Taurek claims regarding the death of two people versus one. The options are A through D, each presenting a different perspective. 

From what I remember, Taurek is known for arguing against the utilitarian principle that the greater good should be maximized, even if it means taking a utilitarian approach to killing or harming individuals. Specifically, I think he challenges the idea that the death of two people is worse than the death of one by simple addition. 

In his essay "Should the Numbers Count?" Taurek presents the idea that when faced with a choice between saving one person or saving two, the moral choice isn't necessarily determined by the greater number. He suggests that each individual's life has intrinsic value and that adding up the lives doesn't make sense in terms of moral calculus. 

So looking at the options:

A: The death of two is always worse. That sounds like a straightforward utilitarian view, which Taurek opposes. So probably not A.

B: The death of two is sometimes less bad than one. Hmm, that might be a possibility, but I think Taurek's argument is more about rejecting the addition of losses rather than it being sometimes less bad.

C: The death of two is exactly as bad. This seems like it's saying two deaths equal one in terms of badness, which doesn't align with Taurek's rejection of additive reasoning.

D: The notion of the sum of two people’s losses should be rejected. Yes, this aligns with Taurek's argument. He argues that we shouldn't sum up individual losses because each life is separate and has its own value. So D seems correct.

Wait, but I should make sure. Let me think again. Taurek's main point is that you can't simply add up the losses or the values. So when faced with a choice between saving one or two, the fact that two is a larger number doesn't necessarily make it worse. He uses examples where saving two might not be the correct choice because each individual's death is significant on its own. Therefore, the idea that two deaths sum up to a worse outcome is incorrect. So D is about rejecting the sum, which matches his view.

The correct answer is D. Taurek argues against the idea that the death of two people is simply worse than the death of one by addition. He rejects the notion of summing individual losses, emphasizing the intrinsic value of each life. 

Answer: D
