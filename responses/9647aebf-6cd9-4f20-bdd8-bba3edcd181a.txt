<think>
Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about Nyquist rates and intervals for two signals. The signals are Sa(200t) and [Sa(200t)] squared. Hmm, I need to figure out the Nyquist rate and interval for each and then match them to the options A through J.

First, let's remember what the Nyquist rate is. The Nyquist rate is twice the maximum frequency present in the signal. And the Nyquist interval is the reciprocal of the Nyquist rate, so it's 1 divided by the Nyquist rate. Right?

Let's start with part (a): Sa(200t). The Sa function, I think, is the sinc function, specifically Sa(x) = sin(x)/x. The sinc function has a certain bandwidth. Wait, the bandwidth of Sa(x) is from -1 to +1 radians, so the maximum frequency is 1 radian per second. But wait, in this case, the argument is 200t, so the function is Sa(200t) = sin(200t)/(200t). So that's a sinc function scaled by 200. 

Scaling the argument affects the bandwidth. The original Sa(t) has a bandwidth of 1 Hz, but when you scale t by 200, it changes the frequency. So the maximum frequency component would be when the highest frequency in Sa(200t) is considered. Let me think. The Sa function's Fourier transform is a rectangular function that's non-zero from -1 to +1. So when you scale t by a factor, say a, the Fourier transform becomes (1/a) times the rect function shifted by +/- a. So in Sa(200t), the scaling factor is 200, so the bandwidth becomes 200 times the original. Wait, no, actually, the original Sa(t) has a bandwidth of 1, so Sa(200t) would have a bandwidth of 200. Because when you scale the time variable by a factor, the frequency is scaled inversely. So if the original function is Sa(t), its Fourier transform is a rect function from -1 to +1. Sa(200t) would have a Fourier transform that's a rect function from -200 to +200, right? So the maximum frequency is 200 Hz. Therefore, the Nyquist rate is twice that, so 400 Hz. So Nyquist rate is 400/pi? Wait, no, wait. Wait, wait. Sa(t) is sin(t)/t, which has a bandwidth of 1 Hz. So Sa(200t) is sin(200t)/(200t). So the function's bandwidth is 200 Hz. So the maximum frequency is 200 Hz. So the Nyquist rate is 2 * 200 = 400 Hz. So Nyquist rate is 400 Hz, which is 400 cycles per second (cps). So Nyquist interval is 1/(400) seconds, which is 0.0025 seconds, but let me check the options.

Wait, looking at the options, the Nyquist rates are expressed in terms of pi. For example, option D says Nyquist rate for Sa(200t) is 200/pi cps. Hmm, that doesn't seem right. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the Sa function. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the Sa(200t) function is being considered in terms of radians per second. Wait, because sometimes in signal processing, the sinc function is considered in radians. So the original Sa(t) has a maximum frequency of 1 rad/s, not 1 Hz. Wait, that's a crucial point. Because 1 radian per second is approximately 0.159 Hz. So when we express frequencies in terms of radians per second, the Nyquist rate is based on that.

Wait, let me clarify. The Sa function, Sa(t), is defined as sin(t)/t, and its Fourier transform is a rectangular function that is 1 between -1 and +1 radians per second, zero elsewhere. So the maximum frequency is 1 rad/s. Therefore, for Sa(200t), the argument is 200t, so the function is sin(200t)/(200t). So the time scaling affects the frequency. If the original Sa(t) has a maximum frequency of 1 rad/s, then scaling t by 200 (i.e., making it Sa(200t)) would change the maximum frequency. When you scale the time variable by a factor a, the frequency is scaled by 1/a. So if a is 200, the maximum frequency becomes 1/(200) rad/s? Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, because the function is Sa(200t) = sin(200t)/(200t). Let me think about the Fourier transform.

The Fourier transform of Sa(at) is (1/a) * rect(ω/(2a)), where rect is 1 between -π and π, perhaps. Wait, no, let me get this straight. The Fourier transform of Sa(t) is π rect(ω/(2π)), where rect is 1 for |ω| < π and 0 otherwise. So the maximum frequency is π radians per second. So for Sa(t), the maximum frequency is π rad/s. So for Sa(200t), the scaling factor a is 200, so the Fourier transform would be (1/200) rect(ω/(2*200))? Or perhaps I have it wrong.

Alternatively, considering that the function Sa(bt) = sin(bt)/(bt), its Fourier transform is (π/b) rect(ω/(2b)), but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think differently. Let's say the original Sa(t) has a bandwidth of π radians per second. When you scale t by a factor, say a, the function becomes Sa(at) = sin(at)/(at). The Fourier transform of this would be (1/a) rect(ω/(2a)) multiplied by π? Wait, perhaps I should look up the Fourier transform properties.

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the maximum frequency. If Sa(t) has a maximum frequency component at π radians per second, then Sa(200t) would have a maximum frequency at π/(200) radians per second. Because scaling t by 200 reduces the frequency by 200. So the maximum frequency is π/(200) rad/s.

So then, the Nyquist rate is twice the maximum frequency. So Nyquist rate = 2 * (π/200) = π/100 rad/s. Wait, but Nyquist rate is usually expressed in Hz, which is cycles per second. So if the maximum frequency is in radians per second, I need to convert it to Hz.

Wait, no, perhaps I'm mixing units. Let me clarify: when we talk about the Nyquist rate, it's in terms of the highest frequency present in the signal, regardless of units. So if the maximum frequency is f_max, then Nyquist rate is 2f_max. But in this case, the maximum frequency is in radians per second. So if the maximum frequency is π/200 rad/s, then how do we express the Nyquist rate?

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The Sa function Sa(at) has its maximum frequency at a, but I think I'm getting confused with the scaling. Maybe another approach: The standard Sa function, Sa(t) = sin(t)/t, has a Fourier transform that is a rectangular pulse from -1 to +1 in the frequency domain, which corresponds to a bandwidth of 1 Hz. Wait, no, that's in terms of angular frequency (ω) where ω is in radians per second. So the rect function from -ω0 to +ω0 corresponds to a bandwidth of ω0. So for Sa(t), the rect function is from -π to +π, so the bandwidth is π radians per second.

So for Sa(200t), the function is sin(200t)/(200t). So what's its bandwidth? The scaling affects the frequency. Since the original Sa(t) has a bandwidth of π radians per second, scaling t by 200 would change the bandwidth. Let me recall that if you have a function f(at), its Fourier transform is (1/a)F(ω/a), where F is the Fourier transform of f(t). So for Sa(200t), the Fourier transform would be (1/200) * rect(ω/(2*200)) * π, perhaps? Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to think about the maximum frequency. The original Sa(t) has its first zero at t= π, so the maximum frequency is π/2? No, wait, the maximum frequency of the Fourier transform of Sa(t) is π radians per second. So for Sa(200t), the maximum frequency would be π/(200) radians per second.

So the maximum frequency f_max is π/(200) rad/s. To convert this to Hz (cycles per second), we divide by 2π, because 1 Hz = 2π radians per second. So f_max (Hz) = (π/(200)) / (2π) ) = 1/(400) Hz. So f_max is 1/400 Hz. Therefore, the Nyquist rate is 2 * f_max = 2 * (1/400) = 1/200 Hz, which is 1/(200) cycles per second. Hmm, but looking at the options, the Nyquist rates are given in terms like 200/pi, 400/pi, etc. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in the approach.

Wait, maybe I should not convert to Hz but keep it in radians. So the maximum frequency is π/(200) rad/s. The Nyquist rate is twice that, so 2*(π/200) = π/100 rad/s. But Nyquist rate is usually expressed in terms of cycles per second, so perhaps I should express it in terms of Hz. So π/100 rad/s is (π/100) / (2π) Hz = 1/(200) Hz. So Nyquist rate is 1/200 Hz, which is 0.005 Hz. That seems really low. But looking at the options, none of them seem to have 1/200 Hz. Let me check the options again.

Wait, looking at option D, the Nyquist rate for Sa(200t) is 200/pi cps. Hmm, that's about 63.66 Hz. That seems high considering the function is Sa(200t). Alternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the scaling.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the Sa function as having a bandwidth of 1 in terms of radians. So for Sa(200t), the maximum frequency is 200 radians per second. So the Nyquist rate would be 2 * 200 = 400 radians per second. Wait, that can't be right because that would be a very high frequency. Alternatively, maybe I'm confusing the scaling.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let's consider the function Sa(200t) = sin(200t)/(200t). The highest frequency component in this function is 100 Hz because the sin function completes a cycle every 2π/(200) seconds, which is π/100 seconds. So the period is π/100, so frequency is 100/π Hz. Wait, that's about 31.83 Hz. So the maximum frequency is 100/π Hz. Therefore, the Nyquist rate is 2*(100/π) = 200/π Hz. So the Nyquist rate is 200/π cps, and the Nyquist interval is 1/(200/π) = π/200 seconds.

Wait, that makes more sense. So for part (a), Sa(200t), the Nyquist rate is 200/π cps, and the interval is π/200 sec.

Now, moving on to part (b): [Sa(200t)]^2. Squaring the signal. I remember that when you square a signal, it can produce frequency components at twice the original maximum frequency. So the original maximum frequency was f_max = 100/π Hz. So when squared, the maximum frequency becomes 2*f_max = 200/π Hz. Therefore, the Nyquist rate for the squared signal is 2*(200/π) = 400/π Hz. Wait, no. Wait, the Nyquist rate is twice the maximum frequency. So if the maximum frequency after squaring is 200/π Hz, then Nyquist rate is 2*(200/π) = 400/π Hz. Wait, but that can't be right because the original maximum frequency was 100/π, so the square would have up to 200/π as the maximum frequency. So the Nyquist rate is 2*(200/π) = 400/π cps, and the interval is π/400 sec.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think again. When you square a signal, the resulting signal's bandwidth can be up to twice the original bandwidth. So if the original maximum frequency was f_max, the squared signal can have components up to 2f_max. Therefore, the Nyquist rate for the squared signal would be 2*(2f_max) = 4f_max. Wait, but that's not correct. The Nyquist rate is twice the maximum frequency present in the signal. So if the maximum frequency after squaring is 2f_max, then Nyquist rate is 2*(2f_max) = 4f_max.

Wait, but in our case, f_max for Sa(200t) was 100/π Hz. So after squaring, the maximum frequency becomes 2*(100/π) = 200/π Hz. Therefore, the Nyquist rate is 2*(200/π) = 400/π Hz. So Nyquist rate is 400/π cps, and interval is π/400 sec.

Now, looking at the options, let's see which option matches.

Option D says:
Nyquist rate for Sa(200t) is 200/π cps, interval π/400 sec.
Nyquist rate for [Sa(200t)]^2 is 100/π cps, interval π/200 sec.

Wait, that doesn't match because the squared signal's rate should be 400/π, not 100/π. So option D is incorrect.

Option A says:
Sa(200t): 200/π cps, interval π/400 sec.
Squared: same rate and interval. That can't be right because the squared signal should have a higher Nyquist rate.

Option F says:
Sa(200t): 100/π cps, interval π/200 sec.
Squared: 200/π cps, interval π/400 sec.

Wait, that would mean the squared signal has a higher rate, which makes sense. So let's check if that's correct.

Wait, earlier I thought the maximum frequency for Sa(200t) is 100/π Hz. So Nyquist rate is 200/π, which matches option F's first part? No, option F says the rate is 100/π for Sa(200t), which doesn't match. So that can't be right.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-examine the maximum frequency of Sa(200t). The function is sin(200t)/(200t). The maximum frequency of this function is determined by the highest frequency component in its Fourier transform. The Fourier transform of Sa(200t) is (1/200) rect(ω/(400)), perhaps? Wait, perhaps the rect function extends from -200 to +200, so the maximum frequency is 200 Hz. Wait, but that would make the Nyquist rate 400 Hz, which is 400 cps. But looking at the options, none of them have 400 cps except option H, which says 400/pi for Sa(200t), interval pi/800.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing radians and Hz. Let me clarify:

The Sa function Sa(t) has a Fourier transform that is a rect function from -1 to +1 in radians per second. So when you scale t by 200, the function becomes Sa(200t) = sin(200t)/(200t). The Fourier transform of this would be (1/200) rect(ω/(400)). So the rect function is non-zero from -200 to +200 radians per second. Therefore, the maximum frequency is 200 radians per second.

Wait, that makes sense. So the maximum frequency is 200 rad/s. To convert that to Hz, we divide by 2π: 200/(2π) ≈ 31.83 Hz. So Nyquist rate is twice that, so 2*(200/(2π)) = 200/π Hz. So Nyquist rate is 200/π cps, and interval is π/200 sec.

So that's part (a). Now for part (b), [Sa(200t)]^2. When you square the signal, the maximum frequency doubles. So the maximum frequency becomes 2*200 = 400 rad/s. Converting to Hz: 400/(2π) ≈ 63.66 Hz. So Nyquist rate is 2*(400/(2π)) = 400/π Hz. So rate is 400/pi cps, interval is pi/400 sec.

Now, looking at the options, which one matches this?

Looking at option D: Sa(200t) rate 200/pi, interval pi/400. Squared: 100/pi, pi/200. Doesn't match.

Option A: Sa rate 200/pi, interval pi/400. Squared same. No.

Option F: Sa rate 100/pi, interval pi/200. Squared rate 200/pi, interval pi/400. Doesn't match because squared should be higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check the squaring again. When you square a signal, the Fourier transform becomes the convolution of the original transform with itself. So if the original transform is non-zero from -200 to +200 rad/s, the squared signal's transform will be the convolution, which would extend from -400 to +400 rad/s. So the maximum frequency is 400 rad/s, so the Nyquist rate is 800 rad/s? Wait, no, Nyquist rate is twice the maximum frequency in Hz. So 400 rad/s is 400/(2π) ≈ 63.66 Hz. So Nyquist rate is 2 * 63.66 ≈ 127.32 Hz, which is 400/π Hz. So that's correct.

Looking at the options, option D says the squared signal's rate is 100/pi, which is about 31.83 Hz. That's half of what it should be, so it's incorrect.

Looking again, perhaps I should look for an option where Sa(200t) has rate 200/pi and squared has 400/pi.

Looking at the options:

Option D: Sa(200t) rate 200/pi, squared 100/pi. No.

Option F: Sa(200t) 100/pi, squared 200/pi. No.

Option H: Sa(200t) 400/pi, squared 50/pi. No.

Option B: Sa(200t) 50/pi, squared 400/pi. No, because Sa should be 200/pi.

Wait, none of the options seem to have both parts correct. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the maximum frequency after squaring. Let me think again. The original Sa(200t) has maximum frequency of 200 rad/s. When squared, the maximum frequency becomes 400 rad/s. So in terms of Hz, that's 400/(2π) ≈ 63.66 Hz. So Nyquist rate is 2 * 63.66 ≈ 127.32 Hz, which is 400/π Hz. So the Nyquist rate for the squared signal is 400/pi cps.

Now, looking for an option where Sa(200t) has 200/pi and squared has 400/pi. Let's check the options again.

Option A: Both have 200/pi. No.

Option D: Sa is 200/pi, squared is 100/pi. No.

Option F: Sa is 100/pi, squared is 200/pi. No.

Option H: Sa is 400/pi, squared 50/pi. No.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the maximum frequency of Sa(200t). Let me go back.

Sa(200t) = sin(200t)/(200t). The Fourier transform of Sa(bt) is (1/b) rect(ω/(2b)) multiplied by π. Wait, perhaps the maximum frequency is b. So for b=200, the maximum frequency is 200 rad/s. So that's correct.

So the squared signal's maximum frequency is 400 rad/s, so Nyquist rate is 400/pi cps.

So now, looking for an option where Sa(200t) has rate 200/pi and squared has 400/pi.

Looking at the options, none of them have that. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the options.

Wait, let me check option F again. It says Sa(200t) has Nyquist rate 100/pi and squared 200/pi. That would imply that the maximum frequency of Sa(200t) is 100/pi rad/s, which is about 31.83 rad/s. But earlier I thought it was 200 rad/s. So perhaps I'm wrong.

Wait, perhaps the maximum frequency is 100 rad/s. Let me think again. The function is Sa(200t) = sin(200t)/(200t). The zeros of this function occur at 200t = nπ, so t = nπ/200. The first zero after t=0 is at t=π/200, which corresponds to a frequency of 200/(2π) ≈ 31.83 Hz. Wait, but that's the first zero crossing. The maximum frequency would be half of that, perhaps? Or is it the same?

Wait, no. The maximum frequency component is the highest frequency present in the signal. For the sinc function, the maximum frequency is at the first peak. The first peak of Sa(x) is at x=0, and the first zero is at x=π. So for Sa(200t), the first zero is at t=π/200, which corresponds to a frequency of 200/(2π) ≈ 31.83 Hz. So the maximum frequency is 31.83 Hz, which is 200/(2π) Hz. So in terms of radians per second, that's 200/(2π) * 2π = 200 rad/s. Wait, that's confusing.

Wait, perhaps I should express the maximum frequency in Hz. The function Sa(200t) has its first zero at t=π/200, so the period is 2*(π/200) = π/100. So frequency is 1/(π/100) = 100/π Hz ≈ 31.83 Hz. So the maximum frequency is 100/π Hz. Therefore, the Nyquist rate is 2*(100/π) = 200/π Hz.

So that's correct for part (a). Now, part (b), [Sa(200t)]^2. The maximum frequency after squaring would be double, so 2*(100/π) = 200/π Hz. Therefore, the Nyquist rate is 2*(200/π) = 400/π Hz.

So now, looking for an option where Sa(200t) has Nyquist rate 200/π and squared has 400/π.

Looking at the options:

Option D: Sa rate 200/pi, squared rate 100/pi. No.

Option F: Sa rate 100/pi, squared 200/pi. No.

Option A: Both have 200/pi. No.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check the options again.

Option D says:
- Sa(200t): 200/pi cps, interval pi/400 sec.
- [Sa(200t)]^2: 100/pi cps, interval pi/200 sec.

That can't be right because the squared should have higher rate.

Option F:
- Sa(200t): 100/pi, interval pi/200.
- Squared: 200/pi, interval pi/400.

No, because Sa(200t) should have 200/pi.

Wait, perhaps I missed an option. Let me check all options:

Option D: Correct for Sa(200t), but squared is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the squaring part. When you square a signal, does the maximum frequency double? Let me think. For the square of a signal with maximum frequency f, the maximum frequency in the square is 2f. So if the original maximum frequency is 100/pi Hz, then squared would be 200/pi Hz. So Nyquist rate is 400/pi Hz.

So looking for an option where Sa(200t) is 200/pi and squared is 400/pi.

Looking at the options again:

Option D: Sa(200t) 200/pi, squared 100/pi. No.

Option F: Sa(200t) 100/pi, squared 200/pi. No.

Option H: Sa(200t) 400/pi, squared 50/pi. No.

Wait, none of the options seem to have both correct. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, perhaps I should recalculate the squared signal's maximum frequency. Let me think again. The original signal Sa(200t) has maximum frequency 100/pi Hz. When squared, the maximum frequency becomes 200/pi Hz. Therefore, Nyquist rate is 2*(200/pi) = 400/pi Hz. So the squared signal's Nyquist rate is 400/pi cps.

Looking at the options, option D has 200/pi for Sa, which is correct, but the squared is 100/pi, which is wrong.

Option F has Sa's rate as 100/pi, which is wrong.

Hmm. Maybe the correct option is not present, but perhaps I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the maximum frequency after squaring is not 2f_max but f_max. Let me think again. When you square a signal, the Fourier transform becomes the convolution of the original transform with itself. So if the original transform is non-zero from -f_max to +f_max, the convolution will be non-zero from -2f_max to +2f_max. So the maximum frequency is 2f_max. So yes, it's correct.

Wait, perhaps the answer is option D, but I'm missing something. Let me double-check.

Sa(200t): maximum frequency is 100/pi Hz. So Nyquist rate is 200/pi cps, interval pi/400.

Squared: maximum frequency is 200/pi Hz. Nyquist rate is 400/pi cps, interval pi/400.

Wait, but option D says squared's Nyquist rate is 100/pi, which is wrong. So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but that can't be. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the maximum frequency.

Wait, perhaps the maximum frequency of the squared signal is the same as the original. No, that's not correct. Squaring a signal can produce higher frequencies.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the squared signal's maximum frequency is 200 Hz, which is 200/pi rad/s. Wait, I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum frequency after squaring is 200 rad/s, which is 200/(2π) ≈ 31.83 Hz. So Nyquist rate is 63.66 Hz, which is 200/pi Hz. So perhaps the squared signal's Nyquist rate is 200/pi, same as the original. But that doesn't make sense because the squared signal should have a higher maximum frequency.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up radians and Hz incorrectly. Let me try to do this again.

The original Sa(200t) has a maximum frequency in radians per second of 200 rad/s. To convert to Hz, it's 200/(2π) ≈ 31.83 Hz. So Nyquist rate is 63.66 Hz, which is 200/π Hz.

When squared, the maximum frequency in radians per second is 400 rad/s. So in Hz, that's 400/(2π) ≈ 63.66 Hz. Therefore, Nyquist rate is 127.32 Hz, which is 400/π Hz.

So the squared signal's Nyquist rate is 400/π cps.

Looking at the options, none of them have both Sa(200t) at 200/pi and squared at 400/pi. So perhaps the correct option is not present, but that can't be the case. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem.

Wait, perhaps I should look for an option where Sa(200t) has Nyquist rate 200/pi and squared has 200/pi. That's option A, but that can't be correct because the squared signal should have a higher rate.

Alternatively, perhaps the squared signal's maximum frequency is the same as the original. That doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the maximum frequency of the original signal. Let me think again. The function Sa(200t) = sin(200t)/(200t). The zeros are at t = nπ/200, so the first zero is at t=π/200, which corresponds to a period of 2π/200 = π/100. So frequency is 1/(π/100) = 100/π Hz. So maximum frequency is 100/π Hz. Therefore, Nyquist rate is 200/π Hz.

When squared, the maximum frequency becomes 200/π Hz. So Nyquist rate is 400/π Hz.

So the correct option should have Sa(200t) at 200/pi and squared at 400/pi.

Looking back at the options, I don't see such an option. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the options.

Wait, let me check option D again: it says for the squared signal, rate is 100/pi, which is half of what it should be. So perhaps the correct answer is not present, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the maximum frequency after squaring is not 2f_max but f_max. That would mean the Nyquist rate for the squared signal is the same as the original. But that's incorrect because squaring a signal can produce higher frequencies.

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum frequency after squaring is f_max, but I think that's not correct.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the squared signal's maximum frequency is f_max, but that can't be right because the square of a sine wave produces higher harmonics.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the Fourier transform. The original Sa(200t) has a Fourier transform that is non-zero from -200 to +200 in radians per second. When you square it, the Fourier transform becomes the convolution of the original transform with itself, resulting in a non-zero region from -400 to +400. So the maximum frequency is 400 rad/s, which is 400/(2π) ≈ 63.66 Hz. So Nyquist rate is 2*63.66 ≈ 127.32 Hz, which is 400/π Hz.

So the squared signal's Nyquist rate is 400/pi cps.

Looking again at the options, I don't see any option where Sa(200t) is 200/pi and squared is 400/pi. Therefore, perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but that's impossible. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption.

Wait, perhaps the maximum frequency of Sa(200t) is 200 Hz in terms of Hz, not radians. Let me try that approach.

If the maximum frequency is 200 Hz, then Nyquist rate is 400 Hz. But none of the options have that. So that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps the maximum frequency is 200/(2π) Hz, which is about 31.83 Hz. So Nyquist rate is 63.66 Hz, which is 200/pi.

So when squared, the maximum frequency is 63.66*2 = 127.32 Hz, which is 200/pi *2 = 400/pi.

So the squared signal's Nyquist rate is 400/pi.

Looking for an option where Sa(200t) is 200/pi and squared is 400/pi.

Looking at option D: Sa is 200/pi, squared is 100/pi. No.

Option F: Sa is 100/pi, squared is 200/pi. No.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the options. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D, but the squared part is wrong. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the maximum frequency after squaring is 200 Hz, which is 200/(2π) ≈ 31.83 Hz. But that would make the Nyquist rate 63.66 Hz, same as the original. That can't be right.

I'm getting stuck here. Perhaps I should look for the option where Sa(200t) is 200/pi and squared is 400/pi. But none of the options have that.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option D, but the squared part is wrong. Alternatively, perhaps I should choose option D because the Sa part is correct, and the squared part is a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the squared signal's maximum frequency is 200/pi Hz, making Nyquist rate 400/pi. So the correct option would be where Sa is 200/pi and squared is 400/pi.

Looking again, perhaps I missed option F. Option F says Sa is 100/pi, squared is 200/pi. No.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the maximum frequency of the original signal. Let me think again.

The function Sa(200t) has its first zero at t=π/200, so the period is π/100, making the frequency 100/π Hz. So the maximum frequency is 100/pi Hz, so Nyquist rate is 200/pi Hz.

When squared, the maximum frequency is 200/pi Hz, so Nyquist rate is 400/pi Hz.

So the correct option should have Sa(200t) at 200/pi and squared at 400/pi.

Looking at the options again, I don't see such an option. Therefore, perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup.

Wait, perhaps the maximum frequency after squaring is the same as the original. That would mean the Nyquist rate remains the same. But that's incorrect because squaring a signal can produce higher frequencies.

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum frequency after squaring is the same as the original. No, that's not correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option D, where Sa(200t) is 200/pi and squared is 100/pi. But that can't be right because the squared should have a higher rate.

Alternatively, perhaps the squared signal's maximum frequency is 100/pi, making Nyquist rate 200/pi. But that would mean the squared signal's maximum frequency is the same as the original, which is incorrect.

I'm stuck. Based on my calculations, the correct rates are Sa(200t): 200/pi, squared:400/pi. But none of the options match this. Therefore, perhaps the correct answer is option D, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the maximum frequency after squaring is the same as the original because the function is squared, but that doesn't make sense. For example, consider a sine wave at f. Squaring it produces a wave with frequency 2f. So the maximum frequency should double.

So, I think the correct answer is that Sa(200t) has Nyquist rate 200/pi and interval pi/400, and squared has rate 400/pi and interval pi/800. But looking at the options, none have this. Therefore, perhaps the correct option is not present, but that's impossible. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, looking at option D: Sa(200t) rate 200/pi, interval pi/400. Squared rate 100/pi, interval pi/200. So perhaps the squared part is wrong, but the Sa part is correct. So perhaps the correct answer is D, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should choose option D because the Sa part is correct, and the squared part is a trick. But I'm not confident.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option D.

The problem involves calculating the Nyquist rate and interval for two signals: \( S_a(200t) \) and \( [S_a(200t)]^2 \). The Nyquist rate is twice the maximum frequency of the signal, and the Nyquist interval is the reciprocal of the Nyquist rate.

### Part (a): \( S_a(200t) \)
The \( S_a(t) \) function has a maximum frequency of \( \frac{1}{2\pi} \) Hz. Scaling \( t \) by 200 increases the frequency by a factor of 200, resulting in a maximum frequency of \( \frac{200}{2\pi} = \frac{100}{\pi} \) Hz. The Nyquist rate is twice this value:  
\[
\text{Nyquist rate} = 2 \times \frac{100}{\pi} = \frac{200}{\pi} \, \text{cps}.
\]  
The Nyquist interval is the reciprocal:  
\[
\text{Nyquist interval} = \frac{1}{\frac{200}{\pi}} = \frac{\pi}{200} \, \text{sec}.
\]

### Part (b): \( [S_a(200t)]^2 \)
Squaring the signal \( S_a(200t) \) doubles the maximum frequency. Thus, the maximum frequency becomes \( 2 \times \frac{100}{\pi} = \frac{200}{\pi} \) Hz. The Nyquist rate is:  
\[
\text{Nyquist rate} = 2 \times \frac{200}{\pi} = \frac{400}{\pi} \, \text{cps}.
\]  
The Nyquist interval is:  
\[
\text{Nyquist interval} = \frac{1}{\frac{400}{\pi}} = \frac{\pi}{400} \, \text{sec}.
\]

### Matching with Options
From the analysis, the correct Nyquist rates and intervals are:  
- \( S_a(200t) \): \( \frac{200}{\pi} \, \text{cps}, \frac{\pi}{400} \, \text{sec} \).  
- \( [S_a(200t)]^2 \): \( \frac{400}{\pi} \, \text{cps}, \frac{\pi}{400} \, \text{sec} \).  

However, none of the options explicitly match these values. The closest match is **Option D**, which correctly identifies the Nyquist rate for \( S_a(200t) \) but incorrectly states the Nyquist rate for \( [S_a(200t)]^2 \). Despite this discrepancy, **Option D** is the most accurate choice among the given options.

**Answer: D**
