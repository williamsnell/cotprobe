Okay, so I have this economics question about how a deposit affects the money supply. Let me try to break it down. The question says a bank acquires an additional $1 of deposits, and there's no required reserve ratio. I need to figure out by how much this one dollar could expand the money supply.

Hmm, I remember that the money supply expansion is related to the money multiplier. The money multiplier tells us how much the money supply can increase based on the reserves banks hold. Normally, the formula is 1 divided by the reserve ratio, right? So if the reserve ratio is r, the multiplier is 1/r. 

Wait, but in this question, the required reserve ratio is zero. That's interesting because if r is zero, the formula would be 1/0, which is undefined. But that can't be the case here. Maybe I'm thinking about this wrong.

Oh, right! If the required reserve ratio is zero, banks don't have to hold any reserves. That means they can lend out all of their deposits. So when a bank gets an extra dollar, they can lend it all, and then that money gets redeposited, and they can lend it again, and so on. But wait, without any required reserves, how does the process stop? Because in the standard model, the reserve ratio determines how much they can lend. If they don't have to keep any reserves, they can keep expanding the money supply indefinitely.

Wait, no. Let me think again. When the reserve ratio is zero, every dollar deposited can be lent out. So each dollar can create more dollars through the lending process. The money multiplier in this case would be infinite because the denominator (reserve ratio) is zero. But that doesn't make practical sense because banks can't actually lend infinitely. There must be some practical limit, but theoretically, it's possible for the money supply to expand infinitely because the bank can keep re-lending the same dollar over and over.

So, the question is about the theoretical maximum expansion. Since the required reserve ratio is zero, the money multiplier is 1/0, which is infinity. Therefore, the money supply could expand infinitely.

Looking at the options, E is "Infinitely." So that must be the correct answer.

The correct answer is E: Infinitely. When the required reserve ratio is zero, banks can lend out all deposits, leading to unlimited money supply expansion.

Answer: E
