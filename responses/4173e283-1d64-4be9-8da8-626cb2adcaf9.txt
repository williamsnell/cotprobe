Question:

Right after finals at the start of summer vacation, Conrad comes down with the flu. Which of the following theories best explains this chain of events?

Options:

A: Erikson's stages of psychosocial development
B: Thorndike's law of effect
C: Selye's general adaptation syndrome
D: Yerkes-Dodson law

F: Freud's psychosexual stages of development
G: Pavlov's classical conditioning
H: Festinger's cognitive dissonance theory
I: Maslow's hierarchy of needs
J: Piaget's stages of cognitive development

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which theory best explains what happened to Conrad. Let me break down the situation first. 

Conrad starts preparing for his finals a month before, then two weeks before he's studying hard each day. Then right after finals, he gets the flu. Hmm. So the question is about why this chain of events happened, and which psychological theory explains it.

Looking at the options, I need to think about each theory and how they might relate to stress, studying, and illness.

Let me go through each option one by one.

A: Erikson's stages of psychosocial development. I think this is about different stages people go through in terms of social and emotional growth. Not sure how this ties into stress and illness.

B: Thorndike's law of effect. That's about how behaviors are strengthened by their outcomesâ€”rewarded behaviors repeat. But how does that explain getting sick after exams?

C: Selye's general adaptation syndrome. Oh right, Selye talked about the body's response to stress. He described how the body adapts to stress in stages: alarm, resistance, exhaustion. If someone is under prolonged stress, their body might wear down, leading to illness. That sounds relevant here because Conrad was studying hard, which is stress, and then he got sick after exams.

D: Yerkes-Dodson law. This is about the optimal level of arousal for performance. Too much stress can actually impair performance. But does it explain getting sick? Maybe indirectly, but I'm not sure it's the best fit.

E: Bandura's social learning theory. This is about learning through observation. Doesn't seem directly related to the stress and illness connection.

F: Freud's psychosexual stages. That's about personality development through different stages involving the id, ego, superego. Not sure how this ties into the events.

G: Pavlov's classical conditioning. That's about learned responses to stimuli. Maybe not directly relevant here.

H: Festinger's cognitive dissonance theory. This is about the mental discomfort from holding conflicting thoughts. Not sure how that leads to illness after exams.

I: Maslow's hierarchy of needs. This is about needs ranging from basic to self-actualization. If someone isn't meeting their basic needs due to stress, maybe that could lead to illness, but I'm not sure if this is the best fit.

J: Piaget's stages of cognitive development. That's about how children develop thinking abilities. Probably not related.

So, focusing on Selye's theory, which deals with the body's response to stress. The scenario describes Conrad studying hard (stressful) and then getting sick. Selye's theory explains the body's adaptation to stress and the potential breakdown leading to illness if the stress is too much or prolonged.

The other options don't seem to fit as well. For example, Yerkes-Dodson is more about performance levels, not the physiological response leading to illness. Similarly, Thorndike's law is about behavior reinforcement, which doesn't directly explain the flu.

The events described involve Conrad experiencing stress from studying hard for exams, followed by an illness. Selye's general adaptation syndrome (Option C) explains how prolonged stress can lead to physical exhaustion and illness, making it the best fit.

Answer: C
