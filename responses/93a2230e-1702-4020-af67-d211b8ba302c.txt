Options:

Okay, so I've got this problem here about a mayoral candidate gaining votes over time. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

The problem says the candidate is gaining votes at a rate of 2000t + 1000 votes per day, where t is the number of days since she announced. They're asking how many supporters she'll have after 60 days, and she had none at t=0.

Hmm, so I think this is a calculus problem where I need to find the total number of votes gained over 60 days. Since the rate is given as a function of t, I should integrate that function from t=0 to t=60. 

Wait, let me make sure. The rate is votes per day, so the total votes after t days would be the integral of (2000t + 1000) dt from 0 to 60. Integrating should give me the area under the curve, which represents the cumulative votes over time.

So, let's set up the integral. The integral of 2000t dt is 1000t², because the integral of t is (1/2)t², so 2000 times that would be 1000t². Then, the integral of 1000 dt is 1000t. So putting it together, the integral from 0 to 60 of (2000t + 1000) dt is [1000t² + 1000t] evaluated from 0 to 60.

Let me compute that. Plugging in t=60: 1000*(60)^2 + 1000*(60) = 1000*3600 + 60,000. 3600 times 1000 is 3,600,000, and 60,000 is 60,000. Adding those together gives 3,660,000. 

Wait, but wait a second. Let me check the calculation again. 60 squared is 3,600, right? So 1000 times 3,600 is 3,600,000. Then 1000 times 60 is 60,000. Adding them gives 3,660,000. 

Now, what about t=0? Plugging in 0 gives 0 + 0 = 0, so subtracting that doesn't change anything. So the total votes after 60 days would be 3,660,000. Looking at the options, option I is 3,660,000. 

Wait, but let me think again. The rate is 2000t + 1000. So each day, the number of votes increases by that amount. So on day 1, it's 2000*1 +1000=3000 votes. On day 2, 4000+1000=5000? Wait no, 2000*2 is 4000 +1000 is 5000. So each day, the increase is increasing by 2000 each day. So over 60 days, it's an arithmetic series where the first term a1 is 3000, the last term a60 is 2000*60 +1000=12,000+1000=13,000. The number of terms is 60. The sum of an arithmetic series is n*(a1 + a_n)/2. So that's 60*(3000 +13,000)/2. Let's compute that. 3000+13,000=16,000. 16,000/2=8,000. 60*8,000=480,000. Wait, that's different from the integral method. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the integral method gave me 3,660,000, but the arithmetic series approach is giving me 480,000. Which one is correct? Hmm, maybe I messed up the arithmetic series approach.

Wait, no, perhaps I'm confusing discrete and continuous sums. Because the problem says the rate is 2000t +1000 per day. So each day, the number of new votes is that amount. So the total votes would be the sum of each day's votes from day 1 to day 60.

Alternatively, the integral gives the continuous accumulation, but since votes are likely counted in discrete days, maybe the sum is the correct approach.

Wait, let me re-examine. The rate is given as votes per day, so each day, the candidate gains 2000t +1000 votes on day t. So for t=0, it's 1000 votes? But the problem says she had no supporters at t=0, so maybe on day 0, she has 0 supporters, and on day 1, she gains 2000*1 +1000=3000, so total 3000. On day 2, gains 5000, total 8000, etc. So the total after 60 days would be the sum from t=1 to t=60 of (2000t +1000).

Wait, but the integral approach is summing over continuous time, whereas the problem is discrete days. So which method is correct here?

Alternatively, maybe the rate is continuous, so the integral is appropriate. Let me think.

The problem says the rate is 2000t +1000 votes per day. So perhaps it's a continuous rate, meaning that the total votes are the integral from 0 to 60 of (2000t +1000) dt, which we calculated as 3,660,000. So that would be option I.

But when I did the arithmetic series approach, I got 480,000, which doesn't match. Maybe I made a mistake in setting up the arithmetic series.

Wait, let me try the arithmetic series again. The number of votes gained each day is 2000t +1000, starting from t=1 to t=60. So the first term a1 is when t=1: 2000*1 +1000=3000. The last term a60 is 2000*60 +1000=12,000+1000=13,000. The number of terms is 60. So the sum is (n/2)*(a1 + a_n) = (60/2)*(3000 +13,000) = 30 * 16,000 = 480,000. But this contradicts the integral method.

Wait, but that can't be right because the integral method gives a much larger number. So where is the confusion here?

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the rate is given per day, so each day, the candidate gains that many votes. So the total would be the sum from t=1 to t=60 of (2000t +1000). But that would be a sum, not an integral.

Alternatively, maybe the rate is continuous, so the integral is the correct approach. Let me see.

Wait, the problem says "gaining votes at a rate of 2000t +1000 votes per day". The term "rate" in calculus usually refers to a continuous rate, so integrating makes sense. So the correct approach would be to integrate from 0 to 60, giving 3,660,000, which is option I.

But why did the arithmetic series approach give a different answer? Ah, perhaps because I'm adding each day's discrete votes, but the integral is the correct method when the rate is continuous.

Wait, but let me check the units. The rate is in votes per day, so when t is in days, the integral over t from 0 to 60 days would give the total votes. So the integral method is correct, and the arithmetic series approach is incorrect because the rate is continuous, not discrete daily jumps.

So the correct answer should be 3,660,000, which is option I.
</think>

The candidate's votes are modeled as a continuous rate, so we integrate the rate over 60 days. 

The integral of (2000t + 1000) from 0 to 60 is:

\[ \int_{0}^{60} (2000t + 1000) \, dt = \left[ 1000t^2 + 1000t \right]_0^{60} = 1000(60)^2 + 1000(60) = 3,600,000 + 60,000 = 3,660,000. \]

Thus, the total supporters after 60 days are 3,660,000.
