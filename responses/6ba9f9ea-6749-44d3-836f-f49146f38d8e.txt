Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about quality management techniques, specifically looking at how internal failure costs relate to measuring improvements in product quality. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand what internal failure costs are. From what I remember, internal failure costs are expenses incurred when products fail before delivery to the customer. These can include things like rework, scrap, repairs, and the costs associated with handling defective materials. So, the question is asking which technique effectively measures improvements in product quality by looking at these internal failure costs.

Looking at the options:

A: Inspection of in-process goods. Well, inspection is a common technique, but does it directly measure the impact on failure costs? Maybe, but I'm not sure if it's the most direct measure of improvement.

B: Monitoring the number of customer complaints. That sounds more like external failure costs because customer complaints occur after delivery. The question is about internal costs, so this might not be the right choice.

C: Measuring the time taken to manufacture each product. Time is more related to efficiency or productivity, not necessarily product quality or failure costs. So probably not this one.

D: Comparing sales data over time. Sales data would show trends in sales volume, which might be affected by quality, but it's not a direct measure of internal failure costs. It's more about demand and market response.

E: Counting the number of products produced. Again, this is about output quantity, not quality or failure costs.

F: Checking the quantity of raw materials used. This relates to material usage and could affect costs, but it's not directly measuring product quality improvements from internal failures.

G: Tracking warranty expenses over time. Hmm, warranty costs are often considered internal failure costs because they involve fixing products after sale but before customer complaints. So tracking warranty expenses could indicate how much the company is spending on fixing defects internally, which would improve if quality goes up. That seems relevant.

H: Evaluating employee performance reviews. This is more about workforce evaluation and doesn't directly tie into product quality metrics related to failure costs.

I: Tracking the number of products reworked. Rework is a direct internal failure cost because it's when products are fixed before delivery. So tracking how much rework occurs would show improvements in quality as this number decreases.

J: Recording the number of products returned over time. Returns could be internal or external. If returns are after delivery, it's external, but sometimes companies handle returns internally. Still, it's a bit ambiguous and might not be as direct as other options.

Now, I have to decide between G and I. Both seem related to internal failure costs. Option G is about warranty expenses, which are costs after the product is delivered but before customer complaints. Option I is about rework, which happens before delivery. Both could measure internal failure costs, but the question is about improvements in product quality as a result of internal failure costs. 

I think the key here is that internal failure costs include things like rework, scrap, and repairs. So tracking the number of products reworked (I) would directly measure the internal failure cost in terms of rework. Similarly, warranty expenses (G) are also a form of internal failure cost because the company is fixing issues before they become external complaints. 

But the question is about measuring improvements in product quality. If rework decreases, it shows that quality has improved because fewer products need fixing before delivery. Similarly, lower warranty claims would also indicate better quality. So both G and I seem relevant, but which one is the best answer?

Looking back at the options, the question says "as a result of internal failure costs." So it's about the techniques that measure the impact on these costs. Both I and G measure different aspects of internal failure costs, but I think the more direct measure of internal failure costs affecting product quality would be tracking the number of products reworked, as that's a direct internal process. Warranty expenses might include other factors like customer service or parts replacement, which could be influenced by external factors beyond just product quality.

Therefore, the best answer is I: Tracking the number of products reworked.

The question focuses on identifying a technique that measures improvements in product quality through internal failure costs. Internal failure costs include expenses like rework, scrap, and repairs. Among the options, tracking the number of products reworked (I) directly measures internal failure costs by assessing how many products need fixing before delivery. This directly impacts product quality as fewer reworks indicate better quality. While warranty expenses (G) also relate to internal costs, they may involve external factors. Thus, the most direct measure is I.

Answer: I
