Question:

Which of the following will be increased in vitamin K deficiency


Options:

A: The plasma concentration of calcitonin
B: The plasma concentration of prothrombin
C: The time for blood to clot
D: Haemolysis due to oxidative damage to red cell membranes

Okay, so I have this question about vitamin K deficiency and what effect it has. Let's see, I remember that vitamin K is important for blood clotting. I think it's involved in the production of certain proteins that the body needs to form clots. So if someone is deficient in vitamin K, their blood might not clot properly.

Looking at the options:

A: The plasma concentration of calcitonin. Wait, calcitonin is a hormone related to calcium regulation, right? I don't think vitamin K deficiency affects that. So probably not A.

B: The plasma concentration of prothrombin. Prothrombin is a protein involved in clotting. Vitamin K helps in the production of prothrombin. If there's less vitamin K, the body can't make enough prothrombin, so its concentration would decrease, not increase. So B might not be the answer.

C: The time for blood to clot. That makes sense because if there's less prothrombin, the blood wouldn't clot as quickly. So the clotting time would increase. That sounds like a likely correct answer.

D: Haemolysis due to oxidative damage. I'm not sure. Haemolysis is when red blood cells break down. Oxidative damage is usually due to free radicals. I don't recall vitamin K being directly involved in protecting against oxidative damage. Maybe this is more related to other vitamins like vitamin E. So probably not D.

So putting it together, the correct answer should be C because vitamin K deficiency leads to impaired blood clotting, thus increasing the time it takes for blood to clot.

The correct answer is C: The time for blood to clot. Vitamin K deficiency reduces the production of prothrombin, a key protein for blood clotting, leading to an increased clotting time.

Answer: C
