Okay, so I have this problem here where Weiser Inc. is offering a discount of $21.90 on dinette tables, and the discount rate is 12 and a half percent. I need to find both the list price and the net price from the given options. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, I remember that a discount rate is a percentage of the original price, right? So the discount amount is calculated by multiplying the list price by the discount rate. The formula I think is: Discount = List Price × Discount Rate. Alternatively, the Net Price is the List Price minus the Discount, so Net Price = List Price - Discount.

Wait, but in this case, I know the discount amount is $21.90, and the discount rate is 12.5%. So I can set up the equation: $21.90 = List Price × 0.125. Because 12.5% is the same as 0.125 in decimal form.

So to find the List Price, I can rearrange the formula: List Price = $21.90 / 0.125. Let me calculate that. Hmm, 0.125 is the same as 1/8, so dividing by 1/8 is the same as multiplying by 8. So $21.90 times 8. Let me do that multiplication: 21.90 × 8. 20 ×8 is 160, and 1.90 ×8 is 15.20, so adding them together gives 175.20. So the List Price is $175.20.

Now that I have the List Price, the Net Price would be List Price minus Discount. So Net Price = $175.20 - $21.90. Let me subtract those. 175.20 minus 21.90. I can subtract 20 from 175.20 to get 155.20, then subtract another 1.90 to get 153.30. So the Net Price is $153.30.

Looking back at the options, I need to find the one where the List Price is $175.20 and the Net Price is $153.30. Let me check the options:

Option A: List $175.20, Net $153.30. That's exactly what I calculated. So the answer should be option A.

The discount amount is $21.90, and the discount rate is 12.5%. Using the formula Discount = List Price × Discount Rate, we calculate the List Price as $21.90 / 0.125 = $175.20. The Net Price is then $175.20 - $21.90 = $153.30.
