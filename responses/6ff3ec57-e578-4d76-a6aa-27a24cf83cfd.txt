Question:

What is the difference between explicit and tacit collusion?

Options:

A: Explicit collusion is an open agreement between companies on pricing, while tacit collusion implies similar pricing without any agreement.
B: Explicit collusion involves a formal contract, while tacit collusion is based on informal social interactions.
C: Explicit collusion is legal while tacit collusion is not
D: Explicit collusion happens only in international markets, while tacit collusion is confined to domestic markets.
E: Explicit collusion is based on verbal agreements, while tacit collusion relies on written contracts.
F: Explicit collusion involves price fixing, while tacit collusion involves product quality fixation
G: Explicit collusion occurs in retail markets, while tacit collusion occurs in wholesale markets.
H: Explicit collusion requires physical meetings, while tacit collusion can be done online
I: Explicit collusion is monitored by regulatory authorities, while tacit collusion goes undetected.
J: Explicit collusion is always done in secret, while tacit collusion is done openly.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the difference between explicit and tacit collusion. I remember from my economics class that collusion is when companies work together to set prices or output, which is usually anti-competitive. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact difference between explicit and tacit.

Explicit collusion sounds like it's when companies openly agree to collude. Maybe they sign a contract or have a formal agreement. Tacit, on the other hand, probably means they don't have a formal agreement but somehow understand that they should act in a certain way without saying it explicitly. Like, maybe they all start raising prices around the same time without talking about it.

Looking at the options:

Option A says explicit is an open agreement on pricing, and tacit implies similar pricing without any agreement. That makes sense because explicit would be open, and tacit is more like a gentlemen's agreement.

Option B talks about formal contracts vs informal social interactions. I'm not sure if that's the main difference. Explicit collusion could involve formal contracts, but I think the key is whether there's an agreement, not just the formality of the interaction.

Option C says explicit is legal and tacit isn't. Wait, I think both are illegal because they're both forms of collusion. So C is probably wrong.

Option D says explicit is only in international markets and tacit is domestic. That doesn't ring a bell. I don't think the location defines the type of collusion.

Option E says explicit is verbal, tacit is written. No, that seems backwards. Tacit might not have any written contracts, but explicit could be either verbal or written. So E is incorrect.

Option F mentions price fixing vs product quality. Both types of collusion can involve price fixing. I don't think product quality is the key here.

Option G talks about retail vs wholesale. I don't think the market type defines the collusion type. So G is likely wrong.

Option H says explicit requires physical meetings, tacit can be online. That might be a possible distinction, but I'm not sure if that's the main difference. Collusion can happen in various ways regardless of the meeting method.

Option I says explicit is monitored, tacit goes undetected. I think that's partially true, but the main difference is about the agreement, not detection.

Option J states explicit is secret, tacit is open. Wait, that seems opposite. Tacit is without explicit agreement, so maybe it's more open in a way because they don't have to hide the agreement as much? Or maybe explicit is done in secret, but I'm not sure.

Going back, the main idea is that explicit collusion involves a clear agreement, like a contract or meeting, while tacit is when companies coordinate without a formal agreement, perhaps through some implicit understanding.

Looking at option A again: Explicit is open agreement on pricing, tacit is similar pricing without agreement. That sounds correct. So A is probably the right answer.

Wait, what about option B? It says explicit is formal contract, tacit is informal. So both could be correct. But the question is about the difference. The key difference is whether there's an agreement, regardless of formality. So A is better because it's about the presence of an agreement, not the formality of the interaction.

So the answer should be A.

The difference between explicit and tacit collusion lies in the presence or absence of an agreement. Explicit collusion involves a clear, open agreement between companies, often formalized through contracts or meetings, to coordinate on pricing or other strategies. Tacit collusion, on the other hand, occurs when companies implicitly understand and act in a coordinated manner without any formal agreement. This can happen through mutual understanding or market practices.

Option A correctly captures this distinction by stating that explicit collusion is an open agreement, while tacit collusion implies similar behavior without any explicit agreement.
