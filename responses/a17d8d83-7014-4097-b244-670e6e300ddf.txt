Question:

In 1985, a widow, the undisputed owner of a cottage, leased it to a tenant for a term of seven years. Rent was to be paid in installments due on the first day of each month. One year later, in 1986, the widow died leaving no heirs. In her will, the widow left her entire estate to the Boy Scouts of America. The cottage was not specifically mentioned in the will. One month after the widow died, the tenant, having learned of her death, decided to remain on the property, but stopped paying rent. The Boy Scouts of America organization was unaware that the widow made a gift to the organization until 2009, when attorneys for the organization conducted an inventory of testamentary gifts to the Boy Scouts of America, which revealed that they had a claim to ownership of the cottage. The statutory period for adverse possession in this jurisdiction is 20 years. The tenant's statutory period for adverse possession began to run when

Options:

A: the Boy Scouts of America discovered the gift in the will.
B: the tenant's lease with the widow expired.
C: the tenant first moved into the cottage.
D: the widow left no heirs.
E: the widow died.
F: the tenant initially signed the lease.
G: the widow first leased the cottage.
H: the Boy Scouts of America took legal action.
I: the tenant discontinued paying rent.
J: the tenant subjectively believed that he no longer had permission to possess the cottage.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this legal question about when the tenant's statutory period for adverse possession began. Hmm, let me break it down step by step.

First, the scenario: In 1985, a widow leased her cottage to a tenant for seven years. The rent was due monthly. Then in 1986, the widow died without heirs and left her entire estate, including the cottage, to the Boy Scouts in her will. However, the will didn't specifically mention the cottage. 

After the widow's death, the tenant continued living there but stopped paying rent a month later. The Boy Scouts didn't find out about the gift until 2009 when they did an inventory. The question is about when the tenant's adverse possession period started. The statutory period is 20 years.

I remember that adverse possession typically requires the possessor to have a claim that is hostile, open, and continuous, and under a claim of right. But in this case, the tenant was leasing the property, so initially, the possession was permissive. But when the landlord (widow) died, ownership transferred to the Boy Scouts. The tenant continued to live there without paying rent after the widow's death.

Wait, so the key here is when the tenant's possession became adverse. The lease was with the widow, and upon her death, the tenant's right to possession would be against the new owner, the Boy Scouts. But since the Boy Scouts didn't know about the gift until 2009, how does that affect the timeline?

I think the adverse possession period starts when the tenant's possession becomes adverse to the true owner's rights. So, when the widow died in 1986, the tenant was still on the lease, but the lease was with the widow. After her death, the tenant's possession was under a lease that was now with the Boy Scouts, but the tenant didn't know that until 2009. 

But wait, the tenant stopped paying rent a month after the widow's death. That might be significant. If the tenant stopped paying rent, perhaps they considered themselves no longer bound by the lease, which could imply an intention to take possession adversarially. Or maybe the lease was still in effect, and the tenant was just in arrears.

I'm a bit confused. Let me think about the elements of adverse possession. The tenant needs to have possession that is hostile (without the owner's permission), open and notorious, continuous, and under a claim of right. 

In this case, the tenant was originally a lessee with the widow's permission. After the widow died, the tenant's lease was with her estate, which passed to the Boy Scouts. But the tenant continued living there without paying rent. So, did the tenant's possession become adverse upon the widow's death, or when they stopped paying rent? Or when they found out about the Boy Scouts' ownership?

I think the critical point is when the tenant's possession became adverse to the current owner's interest. Since the widow died in 1986, the property went to the Boy Scouts. The tenant was still living there under the lease, but the lease was now with the Boy Scouts. If the tenant was in possession with the permission of the new owner (the Boy Scouts), then it's not adverse. But if the tenant's possession was without the new owner's permission, then it could be considered adverse.

However, the Boy Scouts didn't know about their ownership until 2009. So, until then, the tenant was paying rent to the widow's estate, which would have been the Boy Scouts. But the tenant stopped paying rent after the widow died. Does that mean the tenant considered the lease ended? Or did they just stop paying, potentially in breach of the lease?

I'm not entirely sure, but I think the adverse possession period starts when the tenant's possession becomes adverse to the true owner. Since the Boy Scouts were the true owners from 1986, the tenant's possession after that, especially after the lease terms were no longer being honored (like stopping rent), might be considered adverse. But the tenant didn't know about the Boy Scouts' ownership until 2009.

Wait, but the question is about when the statutory period began, not whether they actually had adverse possession. The statutory period starts running when the elements for adverse possession are met. So, when did the tenant's possession become adverse? 

If the lease was with the widow, and the widow died, the lease would continue with the estate. The tenant was still under the lease, so their possession was still permissive. But if the tenant stopped paying rent, perhaps that's when they intended to take possession adversarially. Alternatively, the lease might have ended upon the widow's death, making the tenant a trespasser, which would make their possession adverse.

Wait, no, the lease was for seven years, and the widow died one year into the lease. So the lease would continue with the estate. The tenant was still bound by the lease until its term ended, unless the lease was terminated. But the tenant stopped paying rent, which could be a breach, but not necessarily termination.

I think the key is whether the tenant's possession was permissive or adverse. If the tenant was still under the lease, their possession was permissive. But if the lease was terminated because the widow died, then the tenant would be a trespasser, making their possession adverse.

But in property law, when the lessor dies, the lease typically continues with the estate. So the tenant is still a lessee of the estate, which is the Boy Scouts. Therefore, the tenant's possession is still permissive until the lease ends. But if the tenant stops paying rent, does that terminate the lease? Maybe, depending on the terms. If the lease requires payment and the tenant stops, the landlord (now the Boy Scouts) could terminate the lease, but since they didn't know until 2009, perhaps the lease was still in effect.

Alternatively, the tenant's act of stopping rent might have been a declaration that they were taking possession adversarially. But I'm not sure.

Wait, the question is about when the statutory period began. The statutory period starts when the adverse possession begins, i.e., when the tenant's possession becomes adverse to the owner's interest.

If the tenant continued to pay rent, their possession is permissive. But if they stop paying, maybe that's when they became adverse. Or maybe the lease automatically terminated upon the widow's death, making the tenant a trespasser, thus adverse possession starting in 1986.

But the tenant didn't know about the Boy Scouts until 2009. So, until then, the tenant thought they were leasing from the widow's estate, perhaps. But the estate was the Boy Scouts, so the tenant was leasing from them without knowing.

I think the correct approach is that the tenant's adverse possession period started when the tenant's possession became adverse to the true owner. Since the true owner was the Boy Scouts from 1986, the tenant's possession was permissive under the lease. Therefore, the period didn't start until the tenant's possession became adverse, which might be when they stopped paying rent, as that could be seen as a refusal to pay the new owner (the Boy Scouts). Or perhaps when the lease term ended in 1992, but that's speculative.

Wait, but the lease was for seven years, so it would have ended in 1992. After that, the tenant remained on the property without a lease. So, after 1992, the tenant was a tenant at sufferance, and their possession would be considered adverse if they continued without the landlord's permission. But the question is about when the period began, which would be when the tenant's possession became adverse.

Alternatively, the period starts when the tenant's possession is without the owner's permission. So, if the lease was still in effect until 1992, the tenant was permissive until then. After 1992, if the tenant stayed, that's when the adverse possession might start.

But the question states that the tenant stopped paying rent a month after the widow's death in 1986. So, from 1986 onward, the tenant was not paying rent. If the lease was still in effect, non-payment could be a breach, but possession is still permissive unless the lease is terminated. The landlord (Boy Scouts) didn't know until 2009, so perhaps they couldn't have taken action earlier.

Wait, but the statutory period for adverse possession is about when the tenant's adverse possession started, regardless of when the owner discovered it. So, the period begins when the tenant's possession becomes adverse to the owner's interest.

In this case, the tenant's possession became adverse when the lease ended in 1992, but that's not one of the options. Alternatively, when the tenant stopped paying rent in 1986, that might be when they intended to take possession adversarially, making the period start then.

Looking at the options, option E is when the widow died. Option I is when the tenant discontinued paying rent.

If the tenant's possession became adverse upon the widow's death because the lease was with the estate, which was the Boy Scouts, and the tenant stopped paying rent, perhaps the period started when the widow died because that's when the ownership transferred, and the tenant's continued possession without paying rent could be seen as adverse.

Alternatively, the period starts when the tenant's possession becomes adverse, which might be when they stopped paying rent, indicating they were no longer acknowledging the landlord's right to receive rent, thus implying a hostile claim.

I'm a bit torn between E and I. But I think the period starts when the tenant's possession becomes adverse to the owner's interest. The tenant's act of stopping rent after the widow's death could be the point where they no longer recognized the landlord's right, making their possession adverse.

So, perhaps the period began when the tenant stopped paying rent, which is option I.

The statutory period for adverse possession begins when the tenant's possession becomes adverse to the owner's interest. In this case, the tenant's possession became adverse when they stopped paying rent after the widow's death in 1986, as this indicated a hostile claim to the property.
