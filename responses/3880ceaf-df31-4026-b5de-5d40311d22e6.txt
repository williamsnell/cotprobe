Okay, so I have this problem about finding the minimum vertex cover of an undirected graph G. The graph has edges E = {<0,3>, <1,3>, <2,3>}. I need to figure out which of the options A through J is the correct minimum vertex cover and then represent it in ascending order.

First, let me recall what a vertex cover is. A vertex cover is a set of vertices such that every edge in the graph is incident to at least one vertex in the set. The minimum vertex cover is the smallest possible set of vertices that satisfies this condition.

Looking at the edges, each edge connects one of the nodes 0, 1, or 2 to node 3. So the edges are 0-3, 1-3, and 2-3. That means node 3 is connected to all the other nodes. 

Now, I need to find the smallest set of vertices that touches all these edges. Let's think about each option.

Option F is [3]. If I choose just node 3, does that cover all edges? Well, since every edge is connected to 3, yes. Because each edge has 3 as one endpoint, so including 3 in the vertex cover would cover all three edges. So the vertex cover size here is 1, which is probably the minimum possible.

But wait, let me check the other options to make sure. 

Option A is [1,2,3], which has size 3. That's larger than F, so F is better.

Option B is [0,1,2,3], size 4. Definitely larger.

Option C is [0,1], size 2. Does this cover all edges? Let's see. The edges are 0-3, 1-3, 2-3. If I include 0 and 1, then the edges 0-3 and 1-3 are covered. But the edge 2-3 isn't covered because neither 0 nor 1 is connected to 2. So this set isn't a vertex cover because it misses the edge 2-3. So option C is incorrect.

Option D is [0,2,3], size 3. That's bigger than F, so not the minimum.

Option E is [2,3], size 2. Does that cover all edges? Edge 0-3 is covered because 3 is in the set. Edge 1-3 is also covered. Edge 2-3 is covered because 2 and 3 are both in the set. Wait, but 2 is included, so yes. But wait, does that cover all edges? Let me see: 0-3 is covered by 3, 1-3 by 3, and 2-3 by 2. So yes, [2,3] is a vertex cover of size 2. But F is size 1, which is better.

Wait, but wait a second. In the graph, node 3 is connected to all others. So including 3 alone would cover all edges because every edge has 3 as an endpoint. So [3] is a vertex cover. That's option F. So why did I think option E might be correct? Because option E is [2,3], which also covers all edges, but it's larger than F. So F is better.

So the minimum vertex cover is [3], which is option F. Let me just make sure none of the other options are smaller or better.

Options H is [0,1,3], size 3. So no. Option J is [0,3], size 2. That would cover edges 0-3 and 1-3 (because 3 is in the set), but wait, the edge 2-3 would still need to be covered. Oh wait, no: 3 is in the set, so edge 2-3 is covered because 3 is in the vertex cover. So [0,3] would cover all edges because 3 covers all edges. Wait, but [0,3] is size 2, but [3] alone is size 1, which is better.

So the minimum is [3], option F.

The minimum vertex cover is the smallest set of vertices that touches all edges. In this graph, node 3 is connected to all other nodes, so including only node 3 covers all edges. Therefore, the minimum vertex cover is [3].

Answer: F
