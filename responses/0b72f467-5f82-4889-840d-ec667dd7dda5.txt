The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

On June 1, an appliance manufacturer telephoned a supplier to determine whether the supplier could provide 300 washing machine motors of a particular model by October 1. The supplier offered to do so at a price of $300 per motor (a total price of $90,000). The manufacturer's representative said, "Deal." The next day the manufacturer's representative sent the supplier an unsigned note on company letterhead that stated, "I am happy that you are going to supply us with the motors. I will call you soon to talk about another order." The manufacturer then sent catalogs to its regular customers advertising washing machines that included the specified motors. The manufacturer did not hear from the supplier until July 1, when the supplier called to say that it would be unable to supply the motors because it was no longer carrying that model. At that time, the manufacturer had received no orders for the machines with the specified motors. The manufacturer sued the supplier for breach of contract, and the supplier raised the statute of frauds as a defense. Is the supplier's statute of frauds defense likely to succeed?

Options:

A: Yes, because the manufacturer had not received any orders for the machines with the specified motors at the time of the supplier's refusal.
B: No, because the manufacturer's representative verbally agreed to the deal over the phone.
C: No, because the supplier failed to object to the contents of the note sent by the manufacturer.
D: Yes, because the supplier was no longer carrying the model of the motor at the time of the call.
E: Yes, because there is no writing that contains the quantity term of the contract.
F: Yes, because the manufacturer's note failed to contain a signature.
G: No, because the manufacturer's representative sent the note on company letterhead.
H: No, because the supplier did not inform the manufacturer about not being able to supply the motors in time.
I: Yes, because the supplier never agreed to the contract in writing.
J: No, because the manufacturer distributed the catalogs in reliance on the contract, making the contract enforceable under the statute of frauds.

Okay, so I've got this contract law question here about the statute of frauds. Let me try to break it down step by step. The question involves an appliance manufacturer and a supplier. The manufacturer called the supplier on June 1 to ask if they could provide 300 washing machine motors by October 1. The supplier offered $300 each, totaling $90,000. The manufacturer's rep said, "Deal." 

Then the next day, the manufacturer sent an unsigned note on company letterhead. The note said something about being happy the supplier would provide the motors and that they'd call soon to talk about another order. The manufacturer then sent catalogs to their regular customers advertising washing machines with those motors. 

But then on July 1, the supplier called saying they couldn't supply the motors anymore because they stopped carrying that model. At that point, the manufacturer hadn't received any orders for those machines. They sued for breach, and the supplier is using the statute of frauds as a defense. The question is whether this defense is likely to succeed.

Hmm. I remember the statute of frauds requires certain contracts to be in writing to be enforceable. Specifically, contracts for the sale of goods over $500 must be in writing under the UCC. But wait, here the total is $90,000, which is way over $500, so it definitely falls under the statute of frauds. 

So, the key is whether the writing exists. The manufacturer's rep said "Deal" over the phone, which is a verbal agreement. Then the manufacturer sent a note, but it was unsigned. So, does this unsigned note count as a writing under the statute of frauds?

I think the statute of frauds requires a writing that is signed by the party against whom enforcement is sought. So if the supplier is the one being sued, then the writing needs to be signed by the supplier or someone acting on their behalf. The note sent by the manufacturer is unsigned, so it's just a note on their letterhead. The supplier didn't sign it either.

Wait, but sometimes a confirmation can count. Like, if one party sends a written confirmation that the other party doesn't object to within a certain time, that can be sufficient. But in this case, the note was sent by the manufacturer, and the supplier didn't object until July 1, which is more than a month later. But I'm not sure about the timing. The UCC has a provision where if a party sends a written confirmation and the other party doesn't object within 10 days, it becomes a valid writing. 

Wait, so the manufacturer sent the note on June 2. The supplier didn't object until July 1. That's more than 10 days later. So the note wouldn't count as a valid writing under the statute of frauds because the supplier didn't object in time. Therefore, the contract might not satisfy the statute of frauds, and the supplier's defense would succeed.

But wait, what about part performance? If one party starts performing under the contract, it can take it out of the statute of frauds. But in this case, the manufacturer hasn't received any orders yet, so they haven't started production or anything. The supplier also hasn't delivered any motors. So part performance isn't applicable here.

Another angle: the question says the manufacturer sent out catalogs in reliance on the contract. Does that count as reliance that would take it out of the statute of frauds? I'm not sure. I think reliance is more about whether one party relied on the promise to their detriment. But the fact that they sent catalogs might not be enough. They didn't start manufacturing yet, so maybe not.

So, looking at the options, option E says yes because there's no writing with the quantity term. Wait, but the quantity was 300 motors, which is a material term. If the writing doesn't include that, it's not sufficient. But the note didn't mention the quantity, right? It just said they were happy the supplier would supply the motors and would call about another order. So the note doesn't include all the essential terms, like quantity and price. 

Wait, but the statute of frauds requires a writing that includes the quantity, if it's a sale of goods over $500. The note from the manufacturer didn't mention the quantity, so it's incomplete. Even if the supplier had signed it, it wouldn't have included the quantity. So that's another reason why the writing fails.

Looking at the options, option E says yes because the writing lacks the quantity term. But I thought the main issue was the unsigned note. So which is it?

Option F says yes because the manufacturer's note failed to contain a signature. But the problem is that the note didn't have the supplier's signature. The manufacturer's note on their letterhead isn't enough because the supplier hasn't signed it.

So, the contract is for over $500, requires a writing signed by the supplier. The manufacturer sent an unsigned note, which isn't sufficient. So the supplier's defense should succeed because there's no valid writing. So options E and F are possibilities.

Alternatively, option J says no because the manufacturer relied on the contract by sending catalogs, making it enforceable. But I'm not sure if reliance alone is enough without a valid writing. I think the statute of frauds requires the writing regardless of reliance, unless part performance or something else applies.

So the main issue is the lack of a valid writing. The unsigned note doesn't count because the supplier didn't sign it. Therefore, the supplier's defense is likely to succeed because there's no writing that satisfies the statute of frauds. So the correct answer would be either E or F.

Wait, but the note didn't have the quantity. So even if the supplier had signed it, it's missing the quantity term. So E would also be correct. But which one is the primary issue here?

I think the primary issue is that the note is unsigned. The statute of frauds requires a writing signed by the party against whom enforcement is sought. So even if the note had the quantity, without the supplier's signature, it's not sufficient. So F would be the reason, but F says yes because the note failed to contain a signature. But the note is unsigned, but it's the manufacturer's note. The supplier didn't sign it, so the writing isn't from them.

Wait, but the statute of frauds requires the writing to be signed by the party whose performance is being sought. So in this case, the manufacturer is suing the supplier, so the writing needs to be signed by the supplier. The manufacturer's note isn't signed by the supplier, so it doesn't meet the requirement. Therefore, the supplier's defense would succeed because there's no writing signed by them.

So the correct answer is F: Yes, because the manufacturer's note failed to contain a signature.

Wait, but looking at the options again:

Option E: Yes, because the writing lacks the quantity term.

Option F: Yes, because the note failed to contain a signature.

Option J: No, because the manufacturer relied on the contract.

I think both E and F could be reasons, but the primary issue is the lack of a signature. Because without a signature, even if the quantity was there, it's not enforceable. So F is the main reason.

Wait, but the note wasn't signed by the supplier. The manufacturer's own note, unsigned, isn't enough. So yes, F is correct.

But wait, maybe the oral agreement is enough. The statute of frauds requires a writing, but if the parties have orally agreed, and then one party sends a written confirmation which the other doesn't object to within 10 days, that can suffice. But in this case, the note was sent by the manufacturer, and the supplier didn't object until a month later. So the 10-day period had passed, so the note wouldn't count.

Therefore, the writing isn't valid, so the contract isn't enforceable. So the supplier's defense would succeed. So the answer is either E or F.

Alternatively, the note could be seen as a partial writing, but without the supplier's signature and without the quantity, it's insufficient.

I'm a bit confused between E and F. But I think the main issue is the lack of a signature because the statute of frauds requires a writing signed by the party against whom enforcement is sought. Since the note wasn't signed by the supplier, it doesn't satisfy the requirement. Therefore, the answer is F: Yes, because the manufacturer's note failed to contain a signature.

Wait, but the note was sent by the manufacturer. The supplier didn't sign it. So the note isn't a valid writing under the statute of frauds because it's not signed by the supplier. So the answer is F.

Wait, but another angle: the oral agreement might be sufficient if the writing is received and not objected to within 10 days. But since the supplier didn't object until a month later, the note doesn't count. So the oral agreement stands, but without a valid writing, the statute of frauds applies, and the contract isn't enforceable.

So the supplier's defense is valid, so the answer is either E or F. But the correct reason is the lack of a signature. So F is correct.
</think>

The statute of frauds requires that contracts for the sale of goods over $500 be in writing and signed by the party against whom enforcement is sought. In this case, the contract for 300 washing machine motors totaling $90,000 exceeds the threshold, making the statute of frauds applicable. The manufacturer's unsigned note on company letterhead does not satisfy the requirements because it lacks the supplier's signature. While the note mentions the agreement, it fails to include essential terms like the quantity and is unsigned. Additionally, the supplier did not object to the note within the required 10-day period, but this does not cure the lack of a valid writing. Therefore, the supplier's defense is likely to succeed because the manufacturer's note failed to contain a signature.

Answer: F
