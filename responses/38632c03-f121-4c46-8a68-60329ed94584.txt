Okay, so I need to figure out the correct answer to this multiple-choice question about Bandura's social learning theory, specifically regarding the concept of self-reinforcement. Let me start by recalling what I know about Bandura's theory.

Bandura's social learning theory emphasizes that people learn by observing others and then imitating what they've seen. He introduced several key concepts, including observational learning, which involves learning by watching others. One of the important aspects he discussed is self-reinforcement. 

Self-reinforcement is when a person performs a behavior and then either rewards themselves or punishes themselves based on whether the behavior was appropriate. This is crucial because it allows learning to occur even when there's no external reward or punishment. So, the question is asking what self-reinforcement explains in the absence of external rewards.

Looking at the options:

A: peer pressure influences decision making – This seems more about external influence rather than internal reinforcement.

B: children can overcome the negative effects of poor models – I'm not sure. Maybe self-reinforcement helps, but I'm not certain this is the main point.

C: punishment can be avoided – This seems more about not getting punished externally, which might not directly relate to self-reinforcement's role.

D: the impact of positive reinforcement is amplified – Not sure how self-reinforcement amplifies others' reinforcement.

E: learned behavior is maintained over time – This sounds plausible because self-reinforcement would help maintain behavior without external rewards.

F: rival responses are acquired – Not familiar with this term in the context of Bandura's theory.

G: children can learn to mimic adult behavior – More about observational learning than self-reinforcement.

H: children learn to differentiate between right and wrong – Maybe, but I think self-reinforcement is more about maintaining behavior rather than learning to distinguish right from wrong.

I: children learn to imitate behavior without understanding its implications – This seems more about mimicry without comprehension, which isn't directly related to self-reinforcement.

J: socially appropriate behavior can be learned in the absence of models – This is about learning without observing others, which Bandura's theory does cover, but the question is about self-reinforcement.

Wait, the question is about how self-reinforcement explains behavior in the absence of external rewards. So self-reinforcement would maintain the behavior because the individual is reinforcing themselves. So E seems to fit because learned behavior is maintained over time without external rewards.

But wait, let me think again. Bandura's theory does talk about how self-reinforcement can maintain behavior even when external rewards aren't present. So when there's no external reward, self-reinforcement steps in to keep the behavior going. So E makes sense.

Alternatively, J is about learning without models, which is more about the initial learning, not about maintaining behavior without external rewards. So the correct answer should be E.
