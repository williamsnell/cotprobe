Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure out which two numbers fit the given conditions. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand it correctly.

The problem says: Two whole numbers have a least common multiple (LCM) of 60. Each number is less than or equal to 12. The greatest common factor (GCF) of the two numbers is 2. I need to find which pair from the options A to J is correct.

Hmm, let's break this down. I know that LCM and GCF are related to the factors of the numbers. The formula that connects LCM and GCF is: LCM(a, b) × GCF(a, b) = a × b. So, if I remember correctly, the product of the LCM and GCF of two numbers equals the product of the numbers themselves.

Given that the LCM is 60 and the GCF is 2, I can plug these into the formula. So, 60 × 2 = a × b, which means a × b = 120. Now, I need two numbers that multiply to 120, each is ≤12, and their GCF is 2.

Let me list all the possible pairs of numbers ≤12 that multiply to 120. Let's see:

- 10 and 12: 10 × 12 = 120. Both are ≤12. Let me check their GCF. The factors of 10 are 1,2,5,10; of 12 are 1,2,3,4,6,12. The common factors are 1 and 2, so GCF is 2. That fits the condition. So option J is 10 and 12. Let me keep this in mind.

Wait, but I should check all options to make sure. Let's go through each option.

Option A: 5 and 12. Their product is 60, which is less than 120. So that doesn't fit because 5×12=60≠120. So A is out.

Option B: 12 and 15. Wait, 15 is more than 12, so that's invalid because each number must be ≤12. So B is out.

Option C: 6 and 12. Their product is 72. Not 120. So C is out.

Option D: 4 and 8. Product is 32. Nope. D is out.

Option E: 3 and 9. Product is 27. No. E is out.

Option F: 8 and 10. Their product is 80. Not 120. So F is out.

Option G: 6 and 10. Product is 60. Again, that's too low. So G is out.

Option H: 2 and 10. Product is 20. Not 120. H is out.

Option I: 2 and 6. Product is 12. No. I is out.

Option J: 10 and 12. Product is 120. As I checked earlier, GCF is 2, which matches. So J is a possible answer.

Wait, let me double-check because I might have missed something. The LCM of 10 and 12 is 60, correct? Let me calculate it. The LCM of two numbers can be found by dividing their product by their GCF. So, LCM(10,12) = (10×12)/GCF(10,12). GCF is 2, so 120/2 = 60. Yes, that's correct.

Another way: factors of 10 are 2×5, and factors of 12 are 2²×3. The LCM takes the highest powers of all primes, so 2²×3×5=60. Yep, correct.

So the only pair that fits all the conditions is J: 10 and 12.

The correct answer is J: 10 and 12.
