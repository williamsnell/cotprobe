Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a grindstone slowing down after the motor is turned off. I need to find out how many additional revolutions it makes before coming to rest. Hmm, let's see. 

Alright, the problem states that the initial speed is 240 revolutions per minute, and after 10 seconds, it's down to 180 revolutions per minute. They mention that the angular retardation is constant, which I think means the angular deceleration is constant. So, I should probably use some rotational motion equations here.

Wait, first, maybe I should convert the units to make it easier. Revolutions per minute to revolutions per second might be better because the time given is in seconds. Let me calculate that. 

240 rev/min is 240 divided by 60, which is 4 rev/s. Similarly, 180 rev/min is 180/60 = 3 rev/s. So initial angular velocity ω_initial is 4 rev/s, and after 10 seconds, ω_final is 3 rev/s. 

Angular deceleration α can be found using the equation ω = ω_initial + α*t. Wait, no, actually, the formula is ω = ω0 + α*t, but since it's deceleration, α will be negative. Alternatively, since it's slowing down, the angular velocity decreases, so α is negative. 

So, rearranging the equation: α = (ω - ω0)/t. Plugging in the numbers, α = (3 - 4)/10 = (-1)/10 = -0.1 rev/s². So the angular deceleration is -0.1 rev/s². 

Now, the question is asking how many additional revolutions it makes before coming to rest. So, we need to find the total number of revolutions from the time the motor is turned off until it stops. Wait, but the problem mentions after 10 seconds the speed is 180 rev/min, so maybe we need to consider the total time until it stops, not just another 10 seconds. 

Wait, the initial 10 seconds brings it down to 180 rev/min, but we need to find how much more it turns after that until it stops. Or wait, no, maybe the question is asking from the moment the motor is turned off, which is when it's at 240 rev/min, and how many more revolutions it makes before stopping, including the 10 seconds part. Hmm, I need to clarify that. 

Wait, the problem says: "the motor is switched off when the latter has a rotational speed of 240 rev·min^-1. After 10 s the speed is 180 rev·min^-1." So, the total time after switching off is 10 seconds, and at that point, it's 180 rev/min. Then, the question is, how many additional revolutions does it make before coming to rest? So, from the 10 seconds mark onwards, until it stops. Or wait, maybe it's from the start of switching off until it stops. I think I need to clarify that. 

Wait, no, the way it's phrased: after switching off, at 10 s, speed is 180. So the question is, how many more revolutions after that point (i.e., after 10 seconds) until it stops. So, first, perhaps I should find the time it takes to go from 180 rev/min to rest, and then calculate the revolutions during that time. Alternatively, maybe it's easier to consider the total from 240 rev/min to rest, and then subtract the revolutions already made in the first 10 seconds. But perhaps the first approach is better.

Wait, maybe let me think again. The problem is about the total revolutions from when the motor is turned off until it comes to rest. So from 240 rev/min, it slows down, and after 10 seconds, it's at 180 rev/min. So the total revolutions from the start (when switched off) until it stops would be the sum of the revolutions made in the first 10 seconds plus the revolutions made after that until it stops. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute the total time from 240 rev/min to rest, and then compute the total revolutions, and then subtract the revolutions already made in the first 10 seconds to get the additional ones. Hmm, maybe that's a better approach.

Wait, but the question is about the additional revolutions after the motor is turned off. Wait, no, the question says: how many additional revolutions does it make before coming to rest? So from the moment the motor is turned off, which is when it's at 240 rev/min, until it stops. So the total revolutions from 240 rev/min to rest. But in the first 10 seconds, it's gone to 180 rev/min, so perhaps the problem is asking for the total from 240 to rest, which would include the 10 seconds. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the additional after the 10 seconds. Hmm, the wording is a bit ambiguous. Let me read the question again.

"The motor driving a grindstone is switched off when the latter has a rotational speed of 240 rev·min^-1. After 10 s the speed is 180 rev·min^-1. If the angular retardation remains constant, how many additional revolutions does it make before coming to rest?"

Oh, wait, so the motor is switched off, and 10 seconds later, the speed is 180 rev/min. So the question is, how many additional revolutions does it make beyond that 10 seconds before coming to rest. So from 180 rev/min to 0, how many revolutions? So I need to find the number of revolutions from 180 rev/min to rest, not including the first 10 seconds.

Wait, that makes sense. Because the 10 seconds is already given, and the problem is asking for how much more after that. So I should calculate the revolutions from 180 rev/min to stop.

Wait, but perhaps it's better to compute the total revolutions from 240 rev/min to rest, and then subtract the revolutions made in the first 10 seconds. Either way, the result should be the same.

Wait, but maybe the problem is simply asking for the total from 240 rev/min to rest, which would include the 10 seconds. Hmm, perhaps I should clarify. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking, after the motor is turned off, the speed reduces to 180 rev/min after 10 seconds, and then it continues to slow down. The question is how many more revolutions does it make after that 10 seconds before stopping. So from 180 rev/min to rest, how many revolutions.

Yes, that makes sense. So I need to calculate the number of revolutions from 180 rev/min to stop, given that the angular deceleration is constant.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute the total time to come to rest from 240 rev/min, then compute the total revolutions, subtract the revolutions made in the first 10 seconds. Either approach should work.

Let me proceed step by step.

First, let's find the angular deceleration α. We have:

ω_initial (when motor is off) = 240 rev/min = 4 rev/s

After 10 seconds, ω = 180 rev/min = 3 rev/s

Using the equation ω = ω0 + α*t

3 = 4 + α*10

So α = (3 - 4)/10 = -0.1 rev/s²

So α is -0.1 rev/s².

Now, the angular deceleration is constant, so we can use kinematic equations for rotational motion.

Now, to find how many additional revolutions occur after the 10 seconds, i.e., from 180 rev/min to rest.

Alternatively, compute the total revolutions from 240 rev/min to rest, then subtract the revolutions made in the first 10 seconds.

Let me try both approaches to see which is easier.

First approach: Compute from 180 rev/min to rest.

At ω_initial = 3 rev/s, α = -0.1 rev/s², ω_final = 0.

We can use the equation:

ω² = ω0² + 2αθ

0 = (3)^2 + 2*(-0.1)*θ

9 = 0.2 * θ

θ = 9 / 0.2 = 45 rev

So that's 45 revolutions after the 10 seconds, until it comes to rest. So the answer would be 45 rev, which is option E.

Alternatively, the other approach: Compute total revolutions from 240 rev/min to rest, then subtract the revolutions made in the first 10 seconds.

Total time to come to rest from 240 rev/min:

ω = ω0 + α*t_total

0 = 4 + (-0.1)*t_total

t_total = 4 / 0.1 = 40 seconds.

So total time to stop is 40 seconds.

Now, compute total revolutions during 40 seconds:

We can use θ = ω0*t + 0.5*α*t²

θ_total = 4 *40 + 0.5*(-0.1)*(40)^2

= 160 + 0.5*(-0.1)*1600

= 160 - 0.05*1600

= 160 - 80 = 80 rev.

So total revolutions from 240 rev/min to rest is 80 rev.

Now, compute revolutions in the first 10 seconds:

θ_10s = 4*10 + 0.5*(-0.1)*(10)^2

= 40 + 0.5*(-0.1)*100

= 40 - 5 = 35 rev.

So the additional revolutions after 10 seconds would be θ_total - θ_10s = 80 -35=45 rev.

So same answer as before, 45 rev, option E.

Wait, but looking at the options, E is 45, which matches.

So the answer should be E:45 rev.

To solve the problem, we first convert the rotational speeds from revolutions per minute (rev/min) to revolutions per second (rev/s):

- Initial speed: \( 240 \, \text{rev/min} = 4 \, \text{rev/s} \)
- Speed after 10 seconds: \( 180 \, \text{rev/min} = 3 \, \text{rev/s} \)

Using the rotational motion equation \( \omega = \omega_0 + \alpha t \), where \( \omega_0 = 4 \, \text{rev/s} \), \( \omega = 3 \, \text{rev/s} \), and \( t = 10 \, \text{s} \), we calculate the angular deceleration \( \alpha \):

\[
\alpha = \frac{\omega - \omega_0}{t} = \frac{3 - 4}{10} = -0.1 \, \text{rev/s}^2
\]

Next, we determine the additional revolutions made from \( 180 \, \text{rev/min} \) (or \( 3 \, \text{rev/s} \)) until the grindstone comes to rest. Using the equation \( \omega^2 = \omega_0^2 + 2\alpha\theta \), where \( \omega_0 = 3 \, \text{rev/s} \), \( \omega = 0 \, \text{rev/s} \), and \( \alpha = -0.1 \, \text{rev/s}^2 \):

\[
0 = (3)^2 + 2(-0.1)\theta \implies 9 = 0.2\theta \implies \theta = \frac{9}{0.2} = 45 \, \text{rev}
\]

Thus, the grindstone makes an additional \( 45 \, \text{revolutions} \) before coming to rest.
