Answer:
    
<think>
Okay, so I've got this problem about calculating the heat of combustion of hydrogen gas at a higher temperature, 1500 K. The given data is the enthalpy change ΔH° for the reaction 2H₂(g) + O₂(g) → 2H₂O(g) at 25°C, which is 298 K, and that ΔH is -115,595.8 cal. The question is asking for the heat of combustion at 1500 K, and I have to choose the correct option from A to J.

Hmm, wait, heat of combustion is usually the enthalpy change when a substance completely burns in oxygen. For hydrogen, the combustion reaction is 2H₂ + O₂ → 2H₂O, which is the same as given. But wait, that product is water vapor (gaseous), so the heat of combustion is usually given for liquid water. Oh, right, because the heat of combustion is typically reported as the enthalpy when water is in its liquid state. So maybe I need to adjust for that.

Wait, but the given reaction is for H₂O(g), so the ΔH given is for the formation of water vapor. To find the heat of combustion at 1500 K, I might need to consider the change in enthalpy due to the temperature difference. Oh, right, because enthalpy changes can vary with temperature. So I should use the van't Hoff equation or the Kirchhoff's law to find the ΔH at 1500 K.

Kirchhoff's law states that the change in enthalpy with temperature is related to the heat capacity change. The formula is ΔH2 = ΔH1 + Cp * ΔT, where ΔT is the change in temperature.

Wait, but I'm not given the heat capacity for the reaction. Hmm, maybe I can assume that the heat capacity is constant over the temperature range, but I don't have the value. Alternatively, maybe I can look up the standard heat capacities for the reactants and products.

The reaction is 2H₂ + O₂ → 2H₂O(g). So the standard enthalpies of formation (ΔHf°) for each substance at 298 K are: H₂ is 0 (since it's an element), O₂ is 0, and H₂O(g) is about -57.8 kJ/mol. Wait, but the given ΔH is in calories, so I need to keep the units consistent.

Wait, the given ΔH is -115,595.8 cal for the reaction as written, which produces 2 moles of H₂O(g). So per mole, that's -57,797.9 cal/mol. But I'm not sure if that's necessary yet.

Now, to find the ΔH at 1500 K, I need to calculate the change in enthalpy due to the temperature change from 298 K to 1500 K. The temperature change ΔT is 1500 - 298 = 1202 K.

But without the heat capacity (Cp) for the reaction, I can't directly apply Kirchhoff's equation. Hmm, maybe I can find the Cp for each substance involved and then calculate the overall Cp for the reaction.

The reaction is 2H₂ + O₂ → 2H₂O(g). So the heat capacities would be:

For H₂(g): Cp is about 29.1 J/(mol·K), but I need this in cal/(mol·K). Oh, since 1 cal ≈ 4.184 J, so 29.1 J/(mol·K) is approximately 6.96 cal/(mol·K).

For O₂(g): Cp is around 29.4 J/(mol·K), which is about 6.99 cal/(mol·K).

For H₂O(g): Cp is about 36.7 J/(mol·K), which is about 8.78 cal/(mol·K).

Now, the reaction uses 2 moles of H₂, 1 mole of O₂, and produces 2 moles of H₂O(g). So the total Cp for the reaction is:

(2 * 6.96) + (1 * 6.99) - (2 * 8.78) = let's calculate that.

2 * 6.96 = 13.92
1 * 6.99 = 6.99
Total for reactants: 13.92 + 6.99 = 20.91 cal/(mol·K)

Products: 2 * 8.78 = 17.56 cal/(mol·K)

So the change in Cp (ΔCp) is products minus reactants: 17.56 - 20.91 = -3.35 cal/(mol·K) for the reaction as written.

Wait, but the reaction produces 2 moles of H₂O, so maybe I need to calculate per mole of reaction. Alternatively, per mole of H₂ consumed.

Wait, the given ΔH is for the entire reaction as written, which is 2 H₂ + O₂ → 2 H₂O(g). So the ΔCp for the reaction is -3.35 cal/(mol·K) for the entire reaction.

Now, using Kirchhoff's equation: ΔH2 = ΔH1 + (ΔCp) * ΔT

ΔH1 is -115,595.8 cal. ΔT is 1500 - 298 = 1202 K.

So ΔH2 = (-115,595.8) + (-3.35) * 1202

Calculate (-3.35)*1202:

3.35 * 1200 = 4,020, and 3.35 * 2 = 6.7 → total 4,026.7. So negative is -4,026.7 cal.

So ΔH2 = -115,595.8 -4,026.7 = -119,622.5 cal.

Looking at the options, the closest is option A: -119,767 cal. But wait, I might have made a mistake in the Cp values or calculations.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the Cp values. For example, H₂O(g) has a higher Cp than H₂ and O₂, so when calculating the reaction's Cp, it should be:

ΔCp = [2 * Cp(H₂O)] - [2 * Cp(H₂) + 1 * Cp(O₂)]

Which is [2 * 8.78] - [2*6.96 + 6.99] = 17.56 - (13.92 +6.99)=17.56 -20.91= -3.35 cal/(mol·K), same as before.

So the calculation seems correct. But the options given don't have -119,622.5 cal. The closest is A: -119,767 cal, which is about 145 cal higher than my calculation.

Wait, perhaps the Cp values I used are approximate. Maybe I should use more precise values.

Looking up more precise Cp values:

H₂(g): Cp is 29.124 J/(mol·K) → 29.124 /4.184 ≈ 6.964 cal/(mol·K)

O₂(g): Cp is 29.404 J/(mol·K) → ~6.998 cal/(mol·K)

H₂O(g): Cp is 36.62 J/(mol·K) → 36.62 /4.184 ≈ 8.767 cal/(mol·K)

So:

ΔCp = [2 *8.767] - [2*6.964 + 6.998] = 17.534 - (13.928 +6.998) = 17.534 -20.926 = -3.392 cal/(mol·K)

So ΔCp is -3.392 cal/(mol·K).

Then, ΔH2 = -115,595.8 + (-3.392)*1202

Calculate (-3.392)*1202:

3.392 * 1200 = 4,070.4

3.392 * 2 = 6.784 → total 4,077.184 → negative is -4,077.184

So ΔH2 = -115,595.8 - 4,077.184 ≈ -119,672.984 cal.

Which is approximately -119,673 cal. The options don't have this exactly, but option A is -119,767 cal, which is a bit higher. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the sign.

Wait, wait, wait. The reaction is 2H₂ + O₂ → 2H₂O(g). The given ΔH is -115,595.8 cal, which is exothermic. When temperature increases, the enthalpy change depends on whether the reaction is endothermic or exothermic. For an exothermic reaction (ΔH negative), if the Cp is negative, then increasing temperature would make ΔH more negative? Or less?

Wait, no. Let me think again. The formula is ΔH2 = ΔH1 + ΔCp*(T2-T1)

So if ΔCp is negative, and T2 > T1, then ΔH2 = ΔH1 - |ΔCp|*(ΔT)

In this case, ΔCp is negative (-3.392), so ΔH2 = ΔH1 - 3.392 * 1202.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me recast: ΔH2 = ΔH1 + (ΔCp) * (T2-T1)

So with ΔCp negative, and T2-T1 positive, the second term is negative, so ΔH2 is more negative than ΔH1. But in our calculation, that's what we did. So the result is more negative, which makes sense because for an exothermic reaction with a negative ΔCp, the enthalpy becomes more negative at higher temperatures.

But the options don't have exactly -119,673 cal. The closest is A: -119,767. So perhaps I should check if I made a miscalculation in the multiplication.

Let me compute (-3.392) * 1202:

3.392 * 1000 = 3392

3.392 * 200 = 678.4

3.392 * 2 = 6.784

Total is 3392 + 678.4 = 4070.4 +6.784=4077.184

So yes, -4077.184 cal.

Adding to ΔH1:

-115,595.8 -4,077.184 = -119,672.984 cal.

Looking at the options, the closest is A: -119,767 cal, which is about 94 cal higher than my result. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the heat of combustion is for one mole of H₂, so I need to halve the ΔH.

Wait, wait, the given ΔH is for 2 moles of H₂. So the heat of combustion per mole of H₂ would be (-115,595.8)/2 = -57,797.9 cal/mol.

But the question says "the heat of combustion of hydrogen gas," which is typically per mole. So perhaps the given ΔH is for 2 moles, so the molar heat of combustion is -57,797.9 cal/mol, and we need to find that at 1500 K.

Wait, but in my earlier calculation, I applied Kirchhoff to the entire reaction, so the ΔH2 I calculated is for the entire reaction, which is 2 moles of H₂. So if I want the molar value, I should divide by 2.

Wait, no, the question is about the heat of combustion, which is per mole. So perhaps I should calculate the ΔH per mole.

Wait, the given ΔH is for 2 moles, so ΔH per mole is -57,797.9 cal. Now, using Kirchhoff's law, the ΔCp per mole would be (-3.392 cal/(mol·K)) divided by 2, because the reaction is for 2 moles.

Wait, no. The ΔCp I calculated earlier was for the entire reaction (2 moles). So per mole of H₂, it would be (-3.392 cal/(mol·K)).

Wait, no, because the reaction is 2 H₂ → 2 H₂O, so per mole of H₂, the Cp change is (-3.392 cal/(2 mol·K)) = -1.696 cal/(mol·K).

Wait, maybe I'm complicating this. Let me think again.

The ΔH for the reaction as written is -115,595.8 cal. The ΔCp for the reaction is -3.392 cal/(mol·K). So when applying Kirchhoff's law, ΔH2 for the entire reaction is:

ΔH2 = ΔH1 + (ΔCp) * (T2 - T1)

= -115,595.8 + (-3.392) * 1202 ≈ -115,595.8 -4,077.2 ≈ -119,673 cal.

This is the ΔH for the entire reaction (2 moles of H₂). But the heat of combustion is per mole of H₂, so we divide by 2.

Wait, no, wait. The heat of combustion is defined as the enthalpy change when 1 mole of a substance combusts. So for the reaction 2H₂ + O₂ → 2H₂O(g), the heat of combustion would be ΔH_comb = (-115,595.8 cal)/2 ≈ -57,797.9 cal/mol.

But the question is asking for the heat of combustion at 1500 K, so I think I should calculate the ΔH for the entire reaction first and then adjust per mole.

Wait, no, perhaps the given ΔH is for the entire reaction, so the per mole value is already accounted for. But the question is about the heat of combustion, which is typically per mole. So perhaps I should adjust the per mole value.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the ΔH for the reaction at 1500 K and then express it per mole.

So, ΔH2 for the reaction is -119,673 cal.

Then, per mole of H₂, it's (-119,673 cal) / 2 = -59,836.5 cal/mol.

But wait, the options are all in cal, not per mole. Wait, looking back at the question, the given ΔH is -115,595.8 cal for the reaction as written (2 moles). The options are in cal, so perhaps the answer is for the entire reaction, not per mole.

Wait, the question says "the heat of combustion of hydrogen gas," which is usually expressed per mole. So perhaps the answer should be per mole. But the options are in cal, which I think is for the reaction as written (2 moles), because the given value is for that reaction.

Wait, the options include A: -119,767 cal, which is close to my calculation of -119,673 cal for the entire reaction. So if I'm correct, the answer would be around -119,673 cal, but the closest option is A: -119,767 cal.

But wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the ΔCp. Let me recheck the Cp calculations.

H₂(g): 29.124 J/mol·K → 6.964 cal/(mol·K)

O₂(g):29.404 J/mol·K →6.998 cal/(mol·K)

H₂O(g):36.62 J/mol·K →8.767 cal/(mol·K)

ΔCp = [2*(8.767)] - [2*(6.964) +1*(6.998)] =17.534 - (13.928 +6.998)=17.534 -20.926= -3.392 cal/(mol·K)

Yes, that's correct.

So ΔH2 = -115,595.8 + (-3.392)*1202 ≈-115,595.8 -4,077.184= -119,672.984 cal.

Looking at the options, the closest is A: -119,767 cal, which is about 94 cal higher. Maybe I should consider that the Cp values are approximate, and the exact value might lead to a slightly higher ΔH2.

Alternatively, perhaps the question expects me to use the given ΔH at 298 K as the standard value and not adjust for temperature, but that doesn't make sense because the question specifies 1500 K.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the heat of combustion is given per mole, so I should calculate using per mole basis.

Let me try that.

The reaction per mole of H₂ is: H₂(g) + ½ O₂(g) → H₂O(g)

ΔH for this reaction would be (-115,595.8 cal)/2 = -57,797.9 cal.

Now, applying Kirchhoff's law for this per mole reaction.

The ΔCp for this per mole reaction would be:

ΔCp = [1*(8.767)] - [1*(6.964) + 0.5*(6.998)] 

=8.767 - [6.964 +3.499]

=8.767 -10.463= -1.696 cal/(mol·K)

So ΔH2 = (-57,797.9) + (-1.696) * 1202

Calculate (-1.696)*1202:

1.696 * 1200 = 2,035.2

1.696 *2=3.392 → total 2,038.592 → negative is -2,038.592

So ΔH2 = -57,797.9 -2,038.592 ≈ -59,836.5 cal/mol.

But the question asks for the heat of combustion, which is per mole, so this would be the value. But looking at the options, the numbers are in cal for the reaction, not per mole. So perhaps I should multiply by 2 to get the reaction as written.

-59,836.5 *2= -119,673 cal, which brings me back to the same number as before.

So the answer should be approximately -119,673 cal, but the closest option is A: -119,767 cal.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the sign. Wait, the reaction is exothermic, so a higher temperature would make the enthalpy more negative if ΔCp is negative. So the calculation seems correct.

Wait, perhaps the given options have a rounding error. Option E is -120,000 cal, which is 120,000, but my calculation is closer to -119,673, which is about 119,700. The closest option is A: -119,767.

Wait, maybe I should check the calculation again for any miscalculations.

Alternatively, perhaps the question assumes that the enthalpy of formation is used and that we should calculate the enthalpy of combustion at 1500 K using the standard enthalpies of formation at that temperature. But without data on ΔHf at 1500 K, that's not possible.

Alternatively, maybe the question is simply asking to use the given ΔH at 298 K without considering the temperature change, but that can't be right because the question specifies 1500 K.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The given ΔH is for the reaction as written at 298 K. The question is asking for the same reaction at 1500 K. So using Kirchhoff's law, the answer is approximately -119,673 cal, which is closest to option A: -119,767 cal.

But wait, let me think again. The given ΔH is -115,595.8 cal for the reaction. The options include I: -115,595.8 cal, which is the same as given, but that's at 298 K, not 1500 K.

So the correct approach is to calculate the change using ΔCp and temperature change. So the answer should be around -119,673 cal, but the options don't have that exactly. The closest is A: -119,767, which is about 94 cal higher.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the Cp values are different. Maybe the Cp for H₂O(g) is slightly higher, leading to a more negative ΔCp, thus a more negative ΔH2.

But without exact Cp values, it's hard to say. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects a different approach, like considering the standard enthalpy of combustion, which is usually given for H₂O(l), not H₂O(g). So maybe I should adjust for the phase change.

Wait, that's a good point. The given ΔH is for H₂O(g), but the standard heat of combustion is for H₂O(l). So I need to account for the enthalpy change when water condenses from vapor to liquid.

The enthalpy of vaporization (ΔHvap) of water is approximately 40.7 kJ/mol, which is about 9733 cal/mol.

So, for the reaction 2H₂ + O₂ → 2H₂O(l), the ΔH would be the given value minus 2*(ΔHvap).

Given ΔH(g) is -115,595.8 cal for producing 2 moles of H₂O(g). To get H₂O(l), we need to subtract the heat released when water condenses.

So, ΔH(combustion to liquid) = ΔH(g) - 2*(ΔHvap)

ΔHvap is 40.7 kJ/mol = 40,700 J/mol → 40,700 /4.184 ≈ 9733 cal/mol.

So for 2 moles, 2 * 9733 = 19,466 cal.

So ΔH(combustion to liquid) = -115,595.8 + 19,466 = -96,129.8 cal.

Wait, wait, no. Because condensing water releases heat, so the enthalpy becomes more negative. So the ΔH for producing liquid water is more negative than for vapor.

Wait, the given ΔH is for producing vapor, which is less exothermic than producing liquid. So to get the combustion enthalpy for liquid, you subtract the heat of vaporization (because you're going from vapor to liquid, which releases heat, making the overall ΔH more negative).

So, ΔH(combustion, liquid) = ΔH(g) - 2*(ΔHvap)

= -115,595.8 - 19,466 ≈ -135,061.8 cal.

Wait, that doesn't make sense because the given ΔH is for vapor, and combustion to liquid should be more exothermic. Wait, no, the given ΔH is exothermic (-115,595.8 cal), and subtracting a positive value (19,466 cal) would make it more negative, which is correct.

But now, I have to adjust this ΔH to 1500 K using Kirchhoff's law.

Wait, but this complicates things because the question didn't specify whether it's for liquid or vapor. The given ΔH is for H₂O(g), so perhaps the question is only considering that, and the heat of combustion is for H₂O(g). But usually, heat of combustion is for H₂O(l).

This adds another layer. But I'm not sure if the question expects this adjustment. The question says "heat of combustion of hydrogen gas," which typically refers to the enthalpy when H₂O is in liquid form.

So perhaps I need to first adjust the given ΔH to account for H₂O(l), then adjust for temperature.

Let's proceed step by step.

1. Given ΔH for 2H₂ + O₂ → 2H₂O(g) at 298 K: -115,595.8 cal.

2. To get ΔH for 2H₂ + O₂ → 2H₂O(l), subtract 2*(ΔHvap):

ΔH_combustion_liquid = -115,595.8 - (2 * 40,700 J/mol) → but wait, in calories:

ΔHvap = 40.7 kJ/mol = 40,700 J/mol = 40,700 /4.184 ≈ 9733 cal/mol.

So for 2 moles, 2 * 9733 = 19,466 cal.

So ΔH_combustion_liquid = -115,595.8 -19,466 = -135,061.8 cal.

3. Now, apply Kirchhoff's law to this ΔH at 1500 K.

But now, the reaction is 2H₂ + O₂ → 2H₂O(l). The Cp values are for H₂O(l), which is different. Cp for H₂O(l) is about 75.3 J/(mol·K) → 75.3 /4.184 ≈ 17.97 cal/(mol·K).

So, ΔCp for the reaction (2H₂ + O₂ → 2H₂O(l)):

ΔCp = [2 * Cp(H₂O)] - [2*Cp(H₂) + Cp(O₂)]

= [2*17.97] - [2*6.964 +6.998]

=35.94 - (13.928 +6.998)=35.94 -20.926=15.014 cal/(mol·K).

So ΔCp is positive 15.014 cal/(mol·K).

Now, ΔT is 1500 - 298 = 1202 K.

ΔH2 = ΔH_combustion_liquid + ΔCp * ΔT

= -135,061.8 + 15.014 *1202.

Calculate 15.014 *1202:

15 *1200=18,000

15 *2=30 → 18,030

0.014*1202≈16.828 → total ≈18,046.828 cal.

So ΔH2 = -135,061.8 +18,046.828 ≈-117,014.972 cal.

Hmm, so the ΔH for the reaction at 1500 K is approximately -117,015 cal.

But wait, the question is about the heat of combustion, which is per mole. So for the entire reaction (2 moles), it's -117,015 cal. So per mole, it's -58,507.5 cal/mol.

But looking at the options, the choices are in cal for the entire reaction. So -117,015 cal is close to option B: -117,250 cal.

Wait, but this approach assumes that the heat of combustion is for H₂O(l), which is standard, but the given ΔH is for H₂O(g). So perhaps the correct approach is to first adjust the given ΔH for the phase change, then adjust for temperature.

But this leads me to a different answer than before. Now, the answer is around -117,015 cal, which is option B: -117,250 cal.

But earlier, without considering the phase change, the answer was around -119,673 cal, which is option A.

This is confusing. The question states that the given ΔH is for H₂O(g), but asks for the heat of combustion, which is usually for H₂O(l). So I think the correct approach is to adjust for the phase change first, then apply Kirchhoff's law.

So, after adjusting for phase change, the ΔH_combustion_liquid at 298 K is -135,061.8 cal. Then, applying Kirchhoff's law with the new ΔCp (15.014 cal/(mol·K)), we get ΔH2 = -117,015 cal.

So the closest option is B: -117,250 cal.

But why is there such a discrepancy? Because the phase change significantly affects the enthalpy.

Alternatively, perhaps the question assumes that the combustion is to water vapor, so the phase change adjustment isn't needed. In that case, the earlier calculation of -119,673 cal would apply, making option A the closest.

But the standard heat of combustion is for liquid water, so I think the correct approach is to adjust for the phase change. Therefore, the answer would be around -117,015 cal, which is option B.

Wait, but looking back, the given ΔH is for H₂O(g), and the question is about the heat of combustion at 1500 K. If the question assumes H₂O(g), then the phase change adjustment isn't needed, and the answer is around -119,673 cal, option A.

But the options include E: -120,000 cal, which is close to -119,673.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is simply asking to calculate the enthalpy change using the given value without considering the phase change or temperature adjustment, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the user made a mistake in the question, and the given ΔH is already the heat of combustion for H₂O(l). But the given ΔH is for H₂O(g), so I think I have to proceed with the phase change adjustment.

Given that, the answer would be around -117,015 cal, which is option B.

But I'm not entirely sure. Another approach is to look up the standard enthalpy of combustion of hydrogen. The standard enthalpy of combustion of H₂ is about -241.8 kJ/mol, which is -57,575 cal/mol (since 1 kJ=239 cal approx).

Wait, wait, 1 kJ = 239.006 cal, so 241.8 kJ = 241.8 *239 ≈57,780 cal. So per mole, it's about -57,780 cal.

But this is at 25°C, and the question is at 1500 K. So perhaps the given ΔH is close to this value, and the correct answer after adjusting for temperature would be lower (more negative).

Wait, but earlier calculations with phase change adjustment led to -117,015 cal for the entire reaction, which is -58,507 cal/mol, which aligns with the standard value increasing in magnitude with temperature, which makes sense because the reaction becomes more exothermic at higher temperatures if ΔCp is positive.

But I'm getting a bit stuck here. I think the correct approach is to adjust for the phase change and then apply Kirchhoff's law, leading to option B: -117,250 cal.

Alternatively, perhaps the question expects us to ignore the phase change and just apply Kirchhoff's law to the given ΔH, leading to option A.

Given the confusion, I think the intended answer is option A: -119,767 cal, assuming no phase change adjustment and using the given ΔH for H₂O(g).

To calculate the heat of combustion of hydrogen gas at 1500 K, we start with the given reaction:

\[
2\text{H}_2(g) + \text{O}_2(g) \rightarrow 2\text{H}_2\text{O}(g)
\]

The enthalpy change for this reaction at 298 K is \(\Delta H^\circ = -115,595.8 \, \text{cal}\). The goal is to determine the enthalpy change at 1500 K. 

### Key Steps:
1. **Determine the temperature change**:  
   \[
   \Delta T = 1500 \, \text{K} - 298 \, \text{K} = 1202 \, \text{K}
   \]

2. **Calculate the heat capacities**:  
   Using standard heat capacities (\(C_p\)) for gases in \(\text{cal/(mol·K)}\):  
   - \(\text{H}_2(g)\): \(6.964\)  
   - \(\text{O}_2(g)\): \(6.998\)  
   - \(\text{H}_2\text{O}(g)\): \(8.767\)  

   For the reaction:  
   \[
   \Delta C_p = [2 \cdot C_p(\text{H}_2\text{O})] - [2 \cdot C_p(\text{H}_2) + C_p(\text{O}_2)]
   \]
   Substituting values:  
   \[
   \Delta C_p = [2 \cdot 8.767] - [2 \cdot 6.964 + 6.998] = 17.534 - 20.926 = -3.392 \, \text{cal/(mol·K)}
   \]

3. **Apply Kirchhoff's Law**:  
   \[
   \Delta H_2 = \Delta H_1 + \Delta C_p \cdot \Delta T
   \]
   Substituting values:  
   \[
   \Delta H_2 = -115,595.8 + (-3.392) \cdot 1202
   \]
   Compute the second term:  
   \[
   (-3.392) \cdot 1202 = -4,077.184 \, \text{cal}
   \]
   Thus:  
   \[
   \Delta H_2 = -115,595.8 - 4,077.184 = -119,672.984 \, \text{cal}
   \]

4. **Compare with options**:  
   The calculated value is approximately \(-119,673 \, \text{cal}\). The closest option is **A: -119,767 cal**.

### Conclusion:
The heat of combustion of hydrogen gas at 1500 K is best represented by option **A**.
