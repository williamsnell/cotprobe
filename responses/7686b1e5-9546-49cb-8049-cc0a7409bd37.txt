Answer:
    
<think>
Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because stoichiometry can get a bit tricky. Let me take it step by step. 

The problem is about preparing silver bromide (AgBr) from silver nitrate (AgNO3) and sodium bromide (NaBr). I need to find out how much of each is required to produce 93.3 pounds of AgBr. Oh, and they mentioned that 1 lb is 454 grams, so I'll need to convert units somewhere along the way.

First, I remember that when you prepare a compound like AgBr, it's usually through a double displacement reaction. So AgNO3 would react with NaBr. The balanced equation is key here. Let me write that out.

The reaction should look something like:
AgNO3 + NaBr → AgBr + NaNO3

Wait, but I think I need to balance it properly. Ag and Na are both +1, so each side should have one of each. Let me check: the products are AgBr and NaNO3. So for each molecule of AgNO3 and NaBr, we get one molecule of each product. So the equation is already balanced. Great, that part is done.

Now, I need to find the moles of AgBr produced because that will help me find the moles of each reactant needed. The target is 93.3 lb of AgBr. Let me convert that to grams because molar masses are in grams per mole.

93.3 lb * 454 g/lb = let's calculate that. 93.3 * 454. Hmm, 90 *454 is 40,860, and 3.3*454 is about 1,498.2. So total is 40,860 + 1,498.2 = 42,358.2 grams of AgBr.

Next, find the molar mass of AgBr. Silver (Ag) has a molar mass of about 107.87 g/mol, and bromine (Br) is about 79.90 g/mol. So adding those together: 107.87 + 79.90 = 187.77 g/mol.

Now, moles of AgBr = mass / molar mass. So 42,358.2 g / 187.77 g/mol ≈ let me calculate that. 42,358.2 divided by 187.77. Hmm, let me see. 187.77 * 225 is approximately 42,343 (because 187 *225 = 42,075, and 0.77*225≈174, so total ≈42,249). Close enough. So moles of AgBr ≈ 225.4 moles (exact number might be a bit off, but that's the ballpark).

Since the reaction is 1:1 for AgNO3 and NaBr to AgBr, both reactants will need 225.4 moles each.

Now, I need to find the masses of AgNO3 and NaBr required.

Starting with AgNO3. Its molar mass: Ag is 107.87, N is 14.01, O is 16.00 *3 =48. So total is 107.87 +14.01 +48 = 169.88 g/mol.

Mass of AgNO3 needed: moles * molar mass = 225.4 mol * 169.88 g/mol. Let me compute that. 225 *170 is 38,250. But more accurately, 225.4 *169.88. Let me approximate: 225 *170 = 38,250. But wait, 169.88 is 170 -0.12. So 225 *169.88 = 225*(170-0.12) = 38,250 -27 = 38,223. Then 0.4 *169.88 ≈67.95. So total is about 38,223 +67.95≈38,291 grams. To convert grams to pounds: 38,291 g /454 g/lb ≈ 84.27 lb (since 454*84=38,136, and 454*84.27≈38,290). So AgNO3 needed is approximately 84.3 lb.

Now for NaBr. Molar mass of NaBr: Na is about 22.99, Br is 79.90. So 22.99 +79.90=102.89 g/mol.

Mass of NaBr: 225.4 mol *102.89 g/mol. Let me calculate that. 225 *100=22,500. 225 *2.89≈650.25. So 22,500 +650.25=23,150.25 g. Plus the 0.4 mol: 0.4 *102.89≈41.156 g. So total is 23,150.25 +41.156≈23,191.4 g. Convert to pounds: 23,191.4 /454 ≈51.04 lb. Because 454*51=23,154, and 454*51.04≈23,191.

So the required amounts are approximately 51.04 lb of NaBr and 84.27 lb of AgNO3.

Looking at the options, option C says 52.7 lbs NaBr and 84.7 lbs AgNO3. That's pretty close to our calculations. Let me double-check my calculations to see if I made any mistakes.

Wait, let's recalculate the moles more accurately. The exact mass of AgBr is 93.3 lb *454 g/lb = 93.3 *454 = let me compute that precisely. 93 *454 = 42,222, and 0.3*454=136.2, so total 42,222 +136.2 =42,358.2 grams.

Molar mass AgBr: 107.87 +79.90 =187.77 g/mol. So moles =42,358.2 /187.77 ≈ 225.4 moles.

AgNO3 molar mass: 107.87 +14.01 + (16*3)= 107.87+14.01+48= 169.88 g/mol. So 225.4 *169.88 = let me compute it accurately.

225 *169.88 = 225*(170 -0.12) = 225*170=38,250 minus 225*0.12=27. So 38,250 -27=38,223. Then 0.4 *169.88=67.952. So total is 38,223 +67.952=38,290.952 grams. Convert to pounds: 38,290.952 /454 ≈84.27 lb.

NaBr molar mass: 22.99 +79.90=102.89 g/mol. 225.4 *102.89 = let's compute:

225 *102.89 = 225 *100=22,500; 225 *2.89=650.25. So 22,500 +650.25=23,150.25. Plus 0.4 *102.89=41.156. Total 23,150.25 +41.156=23,191.406 grams. Convert to pounds: 23,191.406 /454 ≈51.04 lb.

So that's about 51 lb of NaBr and 84.3 lb of AgNO3. Looking at the options, option C is 52.7 NaBr and 84.7 AgNO3. Hmm, that's a bit higher than my calculations. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, perhaps I should check the exact value for the moles. Let me compute 42,358.2 grams /187.77 g/mol more precisely.

187.77 * 225 = 187.77 *200=37,554; 187.77*25=4,694.25. Total 37,554 +4,694.25=42,248.25. But we have 42,358.2 grams. So 42,358.2 -42,248.25=109.95 grams left. So 109.95 /187.77 ≈0.586 moles. So total moles=225 +0.586≈225.586.

Wait, so perhaps I should use 225.586 moles instead of 225.4. Let's recalculate.

AgNO3: 225.586 *169.88 = ?

225 *169.88 =38,223. Then 0.586 *169.88≈99.67. So total ≈38,223 +99.67≈38,322.67 grams. To pounds: 38,322.67 /454 ≈84.38 lb.

NaBr: 225.586 *102.89= 225*102.89=23,150.25 +0.586*102.89≈60.36. So total ≈23,150.25 +60.36≈23,210.61 grams. To pounds: 23,210.61 /454 ≈51.12 lb.

Hmm, so that's about 51.12 lb NaBr and 84.38 lb AgNO3. Looking at the options again, option C is 52.7 NaBr and 84.7 AgNO3. That's a bit higher. Did I make a mistake in the calculations?

Wait, perhaps I should check the exact molar masses again. Let me confirm:

Ag: 107.8682 g/mol

Br: 79.904 g/mol → AgBr: 107.8682 +79.904 =187.7722 g/mol.

NaBr: Na is 22.990 g/mol, Br 79.904, so 22.990 +79.904=102.894 g/mol.

AgNO3: Ag 107.8682, N 14.0067, O 16*3=48 → 107.8682+14.0067+48=169.8749 g/mol.

So let me recalculate the moles more accurately.

42,358.2 g AgBr /187.7722 g/mol = let me compute that.

Dividing 42,358.2 by 187.7722:

187.7722 * 225 = 42,248.295. As before, 42,358.2 -42,248.295=109.905. So 109.905 /187.7722 ≈0.5863.

So total moles=225.5863.

Now, AgNO3: 225.5863 *169.8749 = ?

225 *169.8749 = 225*(170 -0.1251) → 225*170=38,250; 225*0.1251≈28.1475. So 38,250 -28.1475=38,221.8525.

Then 0.5863 *169.8749 ≈0.5863*170≈99.67 (exact: 0.5863*169.8749≈99.63).

So total AgNO3 mass≈38,221.8525 +99.63≈38,321.48 grams. To pounds: 38,321.48 /454≈84.38 lb.

NaBr: 225.5863 *102.894 = ?

225 *102.894=225*(100 +2.894)=22,500 +651.15=23,151.15.

0.5863 *102.894≈0.5863*100=58.63; 0.5863*2.894≈1.696 → total≈58.63 +1.696=60.326.

So NaBr mass≈23,151.15 +60.326≈23,211.476 grams. To pounds: 23,211.476 /454≈51.12 lb.

Looking at the options, none exactly match 51.12 and 84.38. The closest option is C: 52.7 NaBr and 84.7 AgNO3. But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial conversion of the AgBr mass.

Wait, let me double-check the initial mass calculation. 93.3 lb *454 g/lb. 93 *454 = (90*454) + (3*454). 90*454=40,860. 3*454=1,362. So 40,860 +1,362=42,222. Then 0.3 lb is 0.3 *454=136.2 grams. So total AgBr mass is 42,222 +136.2=42,358.2 grams. That's correct.

Hmm, perhaps the problem expects rounding. Let me see the options again.

Option C: 52.7 lbs NaBr and 84.7 lbs AgNO3.

Wait, perhaps I should check if I used the correct stoichiometric ratios. The balanced equation is 1:1, so that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the calculations with more precise figures. Let me compute NaBr's mass again.

NaBr: 225.5863 moles *102.894 g/mol.

225 *102.894=23,151.15 g.

0.5863 *102.894= let's calculate exactly: 0.5 *102.894=51.447, 0.08 *102.894=8.2315, 0.0063 *102.894≈0.649. So total≈51.447+8.2315=59.6785 +0.649≈60.3275.

So total NaBr:23,151.15 +60.3275=23,211.4775 grams. 23,211.4775 /454=51.12 lb.

Hmm, but option C has 52.7 lb NaBr and 84.7 lb AgNO3. That's a bit higher. Perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I should calculate the masses more precisely.

Let me compute AgNO3 mass again: 225.5863 *169.8749.

Let me compute 225.5863 *169.8749.

Breaking it down:

225 *169.8749 = 225*(170 -0.1251) = 225*170=38,250; 225*0.1251=28.1475. So 38,250 -28.1475=38,221.8525.

0.5863 *169.8749:

0.5 *169.8749=84.93745

0.08 *169.8749≈13.58999

0.0063 *169.8749≈1.070

Adding those:84.93745 +13.58999=98.52744 +1.070≈99.59744.

So total AgNO3=38,221.8525 +99.59744≈38,321.45 grams →38,321.45 /454=84.38 lb.

Hmm, same as before.

Wait, maybe the problem expects the use of 3 significant figures. Let me check the initial data. The AgBr is 93.3 lb, which is three sig figs. So perhaps the answers are rounded to three sig figs.

So 51.12 lb NaBr is approx 51.1 lb. But none of the options have that. Option C is 52.7 and 84.7. Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the moles.

Wait, let me compute the moles again precisely.

Molar mass AgBr: 187.7722 g/mol.

Mass AgBr:42,358.2 g.

Moles =42,358.2 /187.7722.

Let me do this division accurately.

187.7722 *225=42,248.295, as before.

42,358.2 -42,248.295=109.905.

So 109.905 /187.7722= approximately 0.5863.

So total moles=225.5863.

Hmm, same as before.

Wait, perhaps the options have a typo, but more likely, I made a mistake in the stoichiometry. Let me check the reaction again.

The balanced equation is AgNO3 + NaBr → AgBr + NaNO3. So 1 mole each of AgNO3 and NaBr produces 1 mole of AgBr. So the molar ratios are correct.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the masses again using exact figures.

AgNO3: 225.5863 *169.8749 = let's compute it step by step.

225 *169.8749 = 225 *169 =38,085; 225 *0.8749≈196.2425 → total 38,085 +196.2425=38,281.2425.

0.5863 *169.8749 = let's compute 0.5*169.8749=84.93745, 0.08*169.8749≈13.58999, 0.0063*169.8749≈1.070. So total≈84.93745+13.58999=98.52744 +1.070=99.59744.

Adding to 38,281.2425 +99.59744=38,380.8399 grams. Wait, earlier I had 38,321.45 grams. Hmm, I think I might have made a mistake in the initial multiplication. Let me correct this.

Wait, 225 *169.8749 = ?

Let me compute 200*169.8749=33,974.98.

25*169.8749=4,246.8725.

So 33,974.98 +4,246.8725=38,221.8525 grams.

Then 0.5863 *169.8749≈99.5974 grams.

So total AgNO3=38,221.8525 +99.5974≈38,321.45 grams →84.38 lb.

Hmm, same as before.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects us to use the molar masses to three decimal places, but I think I did that.

Let me check option C: 52.7 NaBr and 84.7 AgNO3.

If I compute NaBr's mass as 52.7 lb, that's 52.7 *454=23,909.8 grams.

Moles NaBr:23,909.8 /102.894≈232.65 moles.

Wait, but we need 225.5863 moles. So that would mean more NaBr than needed, which would suggest perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should check the initial problem statement again. It says 'producing 93.3 lb of AgBr.' So I think my approach is correct.

Wait, perhaps the options are rounded, and the closest is option C. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I should compute the required masses using the molar masses and see which option fits.

Looking at option C: 52.7 lb NaBr →52.7 *454=23,909.8 g.

Moles NaBr:23,909.8 /102.894≈232.65 mol.

But we need 225.5863 mol. That's more than needed. So that would suggest that option C has more NaBr than required. So perhaps that's not the correct option.

Wait, but maybe I should think about any possible errors. Did I mix up the molar masses? Let me check again.

AgNO3: 107.8682 +14.0067 + (16*3)=107.8682+14.0067=121.8749 +48=169.8749 g/mol. Correct.

NaBr:22.990 +79.904=102.894 g/mol. Correct.

Hmm. Maybe I should compute the exact required masses for AgNO3 and NaBr and see which option is closest.

NaBr:51.12 lb, AgNO3:84.38 lb.

Looking at the options, option C is 52.7 NaBr and 84.7 AgNO3. That's a bit higher than my calculations.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial unit conversion. Let me check: 1 lb =454 g. So 93.3 lb *454=42,358.2 g. Correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects us to use 1 lb=453.592 g, which is a more precise figure. Let me try that.

93.3 lb *453.592 g/lb= let's compute. 93 *453.592=42,147.176. 0.3 *453.592=136.0776. So total=42,147.176 +136.0776=42,283.2536 grams.

Molar mass AgBr:187.7722 g/mol.

Moles AgBr=42,283.2536 /187.7722≈225.08 moles.

Now, AgNO3:225.08 *169.8749=225.08 *169.8749.

225 *169.8749=38,221.8525.

0.08 *169.8749≈13.58999.

So total≈38,221.8525 +13.58999≈38,235.44 grams. To pounds:38,235.44 /453.592≈84.25 lb.

NaBr:225.08 *102.894=225 *102.894=23,151.15 +0.08*102.894≈8.2315 →23,159.38 grams. To pounds:23,159.38 /453.592≈51.01 lb.

Hmm, that's very close to 51.01 lb NaBr and 84.25 lb AgNO3. None of the options match exactly, but option C is 52.7 NaBr and 84.7 AgNO3, which is a bit off. Wait, perhaps the problem expects rounding to one decimal place, so 51.0 lb NaBr and 84.3 lb AgNO3. But none of the options have that.

Wait, looking again at the options:

Option C:52.7 NaBr and 84.7 AgNO3.

Wait, perhaps I should check if I made a mistake in the stoichiometric ratio. Let me think: the reaction is 1:1, so yes, correct.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I should compute the masses based on the exact moles needed, using more precise figures.

Alternatively, perhaps I should check the options for the closest match. Since my calculation gives approximately 51.1 lb NaBr and 84.3 lb AgNO3, the closest option is C:52.7 NaBr and 84.7 AgNO3. But that's a bit higher. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute using the exact molar masses and precise moles.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that I used 225.5863 moles, but let me compute it more accurately.

42,358.2 grams /187.7722 g/mol = let me compute this division precisely.

I can compute 42,358.2 ÷187.7722.

Let me set it up as 42,358.2 /187.7722 ≈ ?

Well, 187.7722 *225=42,248.295.

Difference:42,358.2 -42,248.295=109.905.

So 109.905 ÷187.7722 ≈0.5863.

So total moles=225.5863.

Hmm, same as before.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects us to round to the nearest whole number. Let's try that.

Moles AgBr=225.5863≈226 moles.

Then AgNO3:226 *169.8749=226*(170-0.1251)=226*170=38,420 -226*0.1251≈28.28. So 38,420-28.28=38,391.72 grams →38,391.72 /454≈84.54 lb.

NaBr:226 *102.894=226*100=22,600 +226*2.894≈654.844 →22,600+654.844=23,254.844 grams →23,254.844 /454≈51.22 lb.

Still, option C is 52.7 and 84.7, which is a bit higher.

Wait, perhaps the options have a typo, but more likely, I'm missing something. Let me think differently. Maybe the problem uses a different molar mass. Let me check if the molar masses are correct.

Ag: 107.87, Br:79.90, Na:22.99, NO3: 62.004 (14.0067 +3*16.00=14.0067+48=62.0067).

Wait, perhaps I should check another approach. Let me compute the masses using the exact molar masses and see which option fits.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the ratio of NaBr to AgNO3 in the options and see which matches the 1:1 ratio.

The required ratio is 1:1, so the mass of NaBr and AgNO3 should be in the same proportion as their molar masses. Wait, no, the masses will depend on the molar masses. Wait, the moles are the same, so the mass ratio would be (molar mass NaBr):(molar mass AgNO3) = 102.894 :169.8749 ≈ 0.607.

Looking at option C:52.7/84.7 ≈0.622, which is close to 0.607. So that's a possibility.

Option B:45/75=0.6. That's closer.

Option C:52.7/84.7≈0.622.

Hmm, 0.607 is between 0.6 and 0.622. So which is closer? 0.607 is closer to 0.6 (difference 0.007) than to 0.622 (difference 0.015). So option B would have a ratio of 0.6, which is closer to 0.607.

Wait, but option B is 45 lb NaBr and 75 lb AgNO3. Let me compute the moles for each.

NaBr:45 lb *454=20,430 g. Moles=20,430 /102.894≈200.3 moles.

AgNO3:75 lb *454=34,050 g. Moles=34,050 /169.8749≈200.3 moles.

So option B provides exactly 200.3 moles each, which would produce 200.3 moles of AgBr, which is 200.3 *187.7722≈37,647 grams, or 37,647/454≈82.92 lb. But the problem requires 93.3 lb, so option B would only produce about 82.9 lb, which is less than needed. So option B is insufficient.

So option C would give more than needed. Let me check:

NaBr:52.7 lb *454=23,909.8 g. Moles=23,909.8 /102.894≈232.65 moles.

AgNO3:84.7 lb *454=38,549.8 g. Moles=38,549.8 /169.8749≈227.0 moles.

Wait, but the reaction requires equal moles, so if NaBr is 232.65 and AgNO3 is 227.0, the limiting reagent would be AgNO3, producing 227.0 moles of AgBr, which is 227 *187.7722≈42,631 grams, or 42,631 /454≈93.9 lb. That's slightly more than needed (93.3 lb), but close.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to use the exact stoichiometric amounts, leading to option C being the closest.

To determine the required amounts of AgNO₃ and NaBr to produce 93.3 lb of AgBr, the following steps were taken:

1. **Convert the target mass of AgBr to grams**:  
   \( 93.3 \, \text{lb} \times 454 \, \text{g/lb} = 42,358.2 \, \text{g} \).

2. **Calculate the molar mass of AgBr**:  
   \( \text{AgBr} = 107.87 \, \text{g/mol} + 79.90 \, \text{g/mol} = 187.77 \, \text{g/mol} \).

3. **Determine the moles of AgBr**:  
   \( \frac{42,358.2 \, \text{g}}{187.77 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 225.59 \, \text{mol} \).

4. **Use stoichiometry to find moles of reactants**:  
   The balanced reaction \( \text{AgNO}_3 + \text{NaBr} \rightarrow \text{AgBr} + \text{NaNO}_3 \) shows a 1:1 molar ratio.  
   Therefore, \( 225.59 \, \text{mol} \) of both AgNO₃ and NaBr are required.

5. **Calculate the mass of AgNO₃**:  
   \( \text{Molar mass of AgNO}_3 = 169.88 \, \text{g/mol} \).  
   \( 225.59 \, \text{mol} \times 169.88 \, \text{g/mol} = 38,321.4 \, \text{g} \).  
   Convert to pounds:  
   \( \frac{38,321.4 \, \text{g}}{454 \, \text{g/lb}} \approx 84.38 \, \text{lb} \).

6. **Calculate the mass of NaBr**:  
   \( \text{Molar mass of NaBr} = 102.89 \, \text{g/mol} \).  
   \( 225.59 \, \text{mol} \times 102.89 \, \text{g/mol} = 23,211.4 \, \text{g} \).  
   Convert to pounds:  
   \( \frac{23,211.4 \, \text{g}}{454 \, \text{g/lb}} \approx 51.12 \, \text{lb} \).

7. **Compare with options**:  
   The calculated values are approximately \( 51.12 \, \text{lb} \) of NaBr and \( 84.38 \, \text{lb} \) of AgNO₃.  
   Among the given options, **Option C (52.7 lb NaBr and 84.7 lb AgNO₃)** is the closest match.
