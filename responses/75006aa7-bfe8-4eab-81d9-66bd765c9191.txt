Answer the following multiple choice question, selecting from the answer A through to J. After thinking, reply directly with your answer. 

The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

What components of the plasma can affect the blood pressure? Explain how they affect it. What other solutes are present in the plasma?

Options:

A: The concentration of inorganic salts has no effect on blood pressure.
B: The presence of white blood cells is the main determinant of blood pressure.
C: Only red blood cells affect the blood pressure.
D: Only the concentration of oxygen and carbon dioxide in plasma affects blood pressure.
E: Plasma proteins have no influence on blood pressure; plasma is primarily composed of vitamins and minerals.
F: The viscosity of plasma, unrelated to its solute content, is the sole factor influencing blood pressure.
G: Plasma contains only water and no solutes.
H: The concentrations of inorganic salts and plasma proteins can affect the blood pressure. Plasma also contains organic nutrients, nitrogenous waste products, hormones and dissolved gases.
I: Blood pressure is unaffected by plasma composition; plasma contains only immune system factors.
J: The concentration of glucose in plasma is the only factor affecting blood pressure.

Okay, so I've got this question about what components in plasma affect blood pressure and what other solutes are present. Hmm, I remember that plasma is the liquid part of blood, right? It's mostly water, but there are other things in there too.

The question is asking which components affect blood pressure and what other solutes are present. I need to look at each option and see which makes sense.

Option A says inorganic salts have no effect, but I think they do. Like, sodium and potassium affect osmolarity, which can influence blood pressure through the kidneys and such.

Option B says white blood cells are the main determinant, but I don't think that's right. Blood pressure is more about the volume and pressure in vessels, not the number of cells.

Option C says only red blood cells affect it, but red blood cells are in the blood, not plasma. Plus, their count affects viscosity, but plasma's role is more about the liquid component.

Option D says only O2 and CO2 affect it. I don't think that's correct because those gases are important but not the main factors in blood pressure compared to things like salts and proteins.

Option E claims plasma proteins have no influence, which I don't agree with. Plasma proteins contribute to osmotic pressure, so if they're low (like in nephrotic syndrome), edema can occur, affecting blood pressure.

Option F says viscosity is the sole factor, but blood pressure is more influenced by blood volume and the elasticity of arteries, not just plasma viscosity. Plus, viscosity is related to solute content.

Option G says plasma has only water, which is wrong because there are definitely solutes like salts, proteins, glucose, etc.

Option H says inorganic salts and proteins affect blood pressure, and lists other solutes. That sounds right because both salts (affecting osmolarity and volume) and proteins (osmotic pressure) influence blood pressure. Also, plasma contains organic nutrients, waste, hormones, and gases, so that fits.

Option I says plasma composition doesn't affect blood pressure, which is incorrect. Changes in plasma can definitely impact blood pressure.

Option J says only glucose affects it, but that's not true. Glucose does have some effects, but it's not the only factor.

So putting it together, option H seems correct because it correctly identifies the role of salts and proteins in blood pressure and lists other solutes.

The correct answer is H. Plasma's inorganic salts and proteins influence blood pressure by affecting osmolarity and volume. Additionally, plasma contains various solutes like organic nutrients, waste products, hormones, and dissolved gases.
