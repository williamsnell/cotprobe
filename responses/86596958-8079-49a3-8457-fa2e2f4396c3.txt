Okay, so I have this question about a singer who appeared in the 1992 baseball movie 'A League of Their Own.' I'm trying to figure out which one of the options A through J is the correct answer. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I should recall what I know about the movie. 'A League of Their Own' is a baseball film, and I remember it's based on the true story of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League. The movie stars Tom Hanks and Geena Davis, but I'm not sure about any singers in the cast. Wait, wasn't there a famous singer in a smaller role? I think she played a character who was a baseball player as well.

Looking at the options, the singers listed are A: Whitney Houston, B: Madonna, C: Mariah Carey, D: Celine Dion, E: Janet Jackson, F: Prince, G: Britney Spears, H: Garth Brooks, I: Michael Jackson, J: Brandy.

I know that Madonna was in a few movies, but I'm not sure if she was in this one. Wait, no, I think she wasn't. But I remember hearing that a singer played a character named Dottie Hinson. Oh right, that was Geena Davis, but she's an actress, not a singer. Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, no, the singer in the movie was actually the actress who played the role but also sang some songs. I think the main singer in the film is the actress who played the character, but maybe I'm confusing it with another movie.

Wait, no, I'm pretty sure that the singer in the movie is the actress who played Dottie Hinson, but Geena Davis isn't a singer. So maybe the question is referring to someone else. Alternatively, perhaps one of the options is a known singer who appeared in that movie.

I think I remember that the movie included a song by a famous singer. Let me think. The movie's soundtrack had some popular songs. One of the songs was "Take Me Out to the Ball Game," and I think a famous singer covered that. Wait, wasn't that song performed by the actress Geena Davis? Or was it someone else?

Wait, no, Geena Davis did sing in the movie, but she's primarily an actress. Alternatively, maybe another singer was featured. Let me try to recall any other singers in the cast. There's also the character named Minnie, played by another actress, but I don't think she's a singer.

Wait, perhaps it's the actor who played the coach, Tom Hanks, but he's not a singer. Alternatively, maybe one of the other actresses in the movie was a singer. I'm a bit confused.

Wait, I think the answer is A: Whitney Houston. Because Whitney Houston was in the movie, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, I might be mixing it up with another movie where she appeared. Let me think again.

No, wait, I think the singer in the movie was actually the actress Geena Davis, but she's not primarily known as a singer. Alternatively, the answer might be E: Janet Jackson, but I'm not sure.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try another approach. I'll go through each option and see if I can remember if any of them were in the movie.

A: Whitney Houston. I don't recall her being in 'A League of Their Own.' She was in other movies, but not this one.

B: Madonna. I don't think she was in that movie. She has acted in some films, but I don't remember this one.

C: Mariah Carey. She's a singer, but I don't think she appeared in that movie.

D: Celine Dion. She's a singer, but I don't think she was in the movie.

E: Janet Jackson. She's an actress and singer. I'm not sure if she was in 'A League of Their Own.'

F: Prince. He's a singer and actor. I don't think he was in this movie.

G: Britney Spears. She was quite young in 1992, and I don't think she was in that movie.

H: Garth Brooks. He's a country singer, but I don't think he acted in that movie.

I: Michael Jackson. He was a big star, but I don't remember him being in this movie.

J: Brandy. She was a singer and actress, but I don't think she was in that movie in 1992.

Wait, I think I'm mixing up the cast. Let me think again. The main cast included Tom Hanks, Geena Davis, and maybe someone else. Oh, I think I remember now. The singer who played the character of Dottie Hinson was Geena Davis, but she's not a singer. Alternatively, maybe the movie had a song performed by a famous singer. Oh! I think the song "Baseball, Hot Dogs, Apple Pie and Momma" was performed by the actress Geena Davis, but she's not known as a singer. Alternatively, perhaps the song was performed by a different artist.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The question is about a singer who appeared in the movie, not necessarily as a main actress or singer in the role. So perhaps one of the options is an actor in the movie who is also a singer.

Wait, I think I remember now. The actress who played Dottie Hinson is Geena Davis, but she's not a singer. However, the movie also features a song called "A League of Their Own" which was performed by a singer. I think that song was performed by someone else, maybe the actor playing the coach, Tom Hanks, but he's not a singer. Alternatively, perhaps it's someone else.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think differently. I'll look up in my mind if any of the options were in the movie. I think the answer is A: Whitney Houston, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe it's E: Janet Jackson.

Wait, no, I think the correct answer is A: Whitney Houston. Because I remember her being in the movie, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's B: Madonna.

Wait, no, I think I'm wrong. Let me try to recall. The movie 'A League of Their Own' was released in 1992 and stars Tom Hanks, Geena Davis, and Renée Zellweger, I believe. Wait, no, Renée Zellweger was in other movies. Wait, the main cast was Geena Davis, Tom Hanks, and maybe another actress. I think the character Dottie Hinson was played by Geena Davis, and maybe another character was played by someone else.

Wait, perhaps the answer is E: Janet Jackson. Because I think she had a role in the movie. Let me think, Janet Jackson was in the movie 'A League of Their Own' playing the character of Dottie Hinson. No, that's Geena Davis. So maybe Janet Jackson wasn't in it.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to think of the song from the movie. The song "Take Me Out to the Ball Game" was performed in the movie. I think the character sang that, but she was an actress, not a singer. Alternatively, maybe it was performed by a singer in the movie.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is A: Whitney Houston, but I'm not sure. I think I'm stuck, so I'll have to make an educated guess. I think the correct answer is A: Whitney Houston.
