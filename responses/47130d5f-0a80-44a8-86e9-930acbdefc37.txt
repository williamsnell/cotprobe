Okay, so I have this question about contractionary fiscal policy in the United States and how it affects domestic interest rates and the international value of the dollar. I'm a bit rusty on my economics, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

First, let me recall what contractionary fiscal policy is. From what I remember, contractionary fiscal policy involves the government either increasing taxes or decreasing spending with the aim of reducing the money supply. The goal is usually to control inflation or reduce a budget deficit. When the money supply decreases, it can lead to various effects on the economy.

Now, the question is about the impact on two things: domestic interest rates and the value of the dollar internationally. I need to figure out how contractionary fiscal policy affects each of these.

Let's start with domestic interest rates. Contractionary fiscal policy reduces the money supply, which makes it more scarce. When money is scarce, the cost of borrowing (interest rates) tends to go up because there's less money available for loans. So I think contractionary fiscal policy would lead to an increase in interest rates. That makes sense because if the government is taking money out of the economy, banks have less to lend, so they charge more to lend what they have.

Next, the effect on the dollar's value. If contractionary fiscal policy is implemented, it can lead to higher interest rates in the US. Higher interest rates can attract foreign investors because they get a better return on their investments in US bonds or other fixed-income securities. When foreign money flows into the US to take advantage of higher rates, the demand for dollars increases. Higher demand for a currency makes it appreciate, meaning its value goes up relative to other currencies.

So putting these together, contractionary fiscal policy would likely cause interest rates to increase and the dollar to appreciate. Now looking at the options, I need to find the option that matches these two effects.

Looking at the options:

A: Interest rates increase and the dollar depreciates. → Doesn't match because I think the dollar would appreciate, not depreciate.

B: Interest rates same and dollar depreciates. → Doesn't fit.

C: Interest rates decrease and dollar appreciates. → No, because contractionary policy increases rates.

D: Both same. → Unlikely.

E: Rates increase, dollar same. → Maybe, but I think the dollar would appreciate.

F: Rates same, dollar appreciates. → Doesn't fit.

G: No predictable effect. → I think there is a predictable effect.

H: Rates decrease, dollar depreciates. → Opposite of what I think.

I: Rates increase, dollar appreciates. → This matches my reasoning.

J: Rates decrease, dollar same. → No.

So the correct answer should be option I: Interest rates increase and the dollar appreciates.

The contractionary fiscal policy reduces the money supply, leading to higher domestic interest rates. Higher interest rates attract foreign investment, increasing the demand for dollars and causing it to appreciate.
