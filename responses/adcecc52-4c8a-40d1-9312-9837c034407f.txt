Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about work management, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let's read it again carefully.

The question is asking what ensures that one individual does not carry the burden of a whole work task. The options are A through J, with each being a different work management concept.

Hmm, so I need to think about what each option means. Work delegation is when a manager assigns tasks to others, right? So if one person takes on a lot of work, that might mean they're carrying the burden. So A might not be the answer because delegation could mean someone is taking on more than they're supposed to.

Workload balancing sounds like it's distributing tasks evenly. So each person would have a fair share, reducing the chance of one person doing all the work. That makes sense. So B could be the correct answer.

Work distribution is a bit vague. I'm not entirely sure what that means. It could be similar to delegation, or maybe it's about spreading tasks in another way. I'll have to think about the other options to see if this fits.

Work specialisation is when people focus on one area and become experts there. That doesn't balance the workload; instead, it can lead to concentration and perhaps higher stress or failure. So that's probably not the answer.

Work rotation is when workers move from one job to another, which might distribute the load better. It's more about switching roles, so each person spends time on different tasks. That sounds promising, but I'm not sure if it's a more common term than workload balancing.

Work division is about dividing tasks into separate projects. That spreads the workload, so each person isn't doing everything, which seems right. But I'm not as certain about this as work balancing.

Work design refers to creating a system or structure for work, which could include balancing. But I'm not sure how specific that is.

Work schedule is about the timing, but it doesn't directly address the burden a person is carrying. Work design might be more about how work is structured, but I'm not certain.

Work design could be a way to structure tasks, but I'm not sure if that's the specific term used for workload distribution or balancing.

Wait, work division is about dividing tasks into parts, which is a way to spread the burden. Work distribution might be a broader term, but maybe it's similar to work division or work balancing.

Work load balancing aims to distribute tasks evenly, so that each person doesn't have to do too much. Work rotation might also help because it spreads out the time each person spends on different tasks, reducing the burden on any one person.

I'm a bit torn between B and E. Work division sounds more like dividing into separate parts, which is similar to work distribution. Work rotation is about moving between roles. Hmm.

Wait, the question is specifically about ensuring that one individual doesn't carry the burden. Work division might mean splitting tasks, so each person doesn't do the whole. Work rotation spreads out time, so that each person isn't overburdened.

Alternatively, workload balancing is a method where tasks are distributed to avoid one person doing all the work. So maybe B is the answer.

But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again. Work division could mean dividing a task into subtasks, which is a way to spread it. Work rotation might involve moving between tasks, distributing time. Work distribution is vague, but work division is more about dividing into parts.

So I'm leaning towards B: Workload balancing. That's the one where tasks are divided so that no one person is carrying the entire load.

The correct answer is B: Workload balancing. This ensures that tasks are distributed evenly so no individual carries the entire burden. 

Answer: B
