Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me start by reading the question carefully. 

The question says that a female fruit fly with linked genes showing a gray body and normal wings mates with a male who has a black body and vestigial wings. Among their progeny, there are some flies that are gray-bodied with vestigial wings. I need to explain why this happens, choosing from the given options A to J.

Hmm, linked genes... I remember that linked genes are genes located close together on the same chromosome, so they tend to be inherited together. When linked genes are involved, crossing over can sometimes happen, which can break the linkage. But I'm not sure yet how that applies here.

Wait, the parents are female and male. The female has gray body and normal wings, the male has black body and vestigial wings. So, let's think about their possible genotypes. Let me denote the genes. Let's say the body color gene is one locus and the wing type is another. Gray and black might be different alleles, but since they're linked, maybe they're on the same chromosome. But wait, in fruit flies, the body color is usually on the X chromosome. Oh right, because fruit flies have an XY system. So females are XX and males are XY. 

So, if the female is gray-bodied, she must have two X chromosomes. Let's say gray is dominant (maybe G) and black is recessive (g). So the female would be X^G X^something. Since she's gray, her genotype for body color is X^G X^G or X^G X^g. But wait, she's mated to a male with black body, which is probably X^g Y. So if the female is X^G X^g, she could pass on either X^G or X^g. The male would pass X^g from his X and Y (but Y doesn't have the body color gene). 

Wait, but the wings are another trait. Normal wings and vestigial wings. Vestigial wings are a recessive trait, I think. So for wings, let's say the gene is on the same chromosome as body color since they're linked. So the female has normal wings, which is dominant, let's say N for normal and n for vestigial. So she's NN or Nn. The male has vestigial wings, which is recessive, so his genotype is nn.

Wait, but the problem says the genes are linked. So both body color and wing type are on the same chromosome. That complicates things because the traits are linked, so their inheritance might be correlated.

When the female (gray body, normal wings) and the male (black body, vestigial wings) mate, why do some progeny have gray body and vestigial wings? That seems unusual because if the parents are gray and black, and normal and vestigial, the linked genes would typically mean the traits are inherited together.

Wait, let's map it out. Let's assume the female's genotype is X^G X^g for body color (since she's gray, X^G is dominant) and for wings, since she's normal, let's say N for normal and n for vestigial. So her genotype for wings is Nn or NN. The male is X^g Y (black body) and nn (vestigial wings). 

But wait, fruit flies have the wings on the autosomes, not on the X. Oh wait, no, wing type is on an autosome. Wait, no. I'm a bit confused. Let me clarify: in fruit flies, wing type (vestigial vs normal) is on an autosome, and body color is on the X chromosome. But in this problem, the genes are linked. So both body color and wing type are on the same chromosome. That's unusual because typically, they're on different chromosomes, but the question says they're linked, so they're on the same chromosome.

So, the female's genotype for the linked genes (body color and wing type) would be something like G N on one chromosome and g n on the other. Because she's gray (so G is dominant) and has normal wings (N dominant). The male would have g n on his X and Y, but wait, the wing gene is on an autosome, so maybe the male is homozygous for the recessive wing. Wait, this is getting a bit tangled.

Let me think again. The female has gray body (so X^G X^something) and normal wings. The male has black body (X^g Y) and vestigial wings (nn). The linked genes are on the same chromosome, so perhaps the female is X^G X^g for body and N n for wings, but since they're linked, maybe the G is linked to N, and g is linked to n.

Wait, no, linked genes are on the same chromosome, so the alleles for body color and wing type are on the same chromosome. So for the female, her possible gametes would carry either the G (with N) or g (with n), assuming no crossing over. Similarly, the male would have gametes with g and n (since he is X^g Y, but the Y doesn't have the body color gene, so maybe this is a different scenario.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to approach it differently. Since the parents are linked, their offspring shouldn't show independent assortment. So the presence of certain phenotypes would indicate if crossing over happened.

So the female has gray body and normal wings, and the male has black body and vestigial wings. If the genes are linked, their offspring should mostly show the parental types: gray-normal and black-vestigial. But if some offspring are gray-vestigial or black-normal, that suggests crossing over happened during meiosis, breaking the linkage.

In this case, the question says that some progeny are gray-bodied and vestigial-winged. So that's a recombinant phenotype. That suggests that crossing over occurred in the parents' gametes, leading to recombinant chromosomes.

So the presence of gray-vestigial flies (which are recombinants) is best explained by crossing over, which would allow the linked genes to separate. So the correct answer should be E: crossing over.

Wait, but let me make sure. The options are A through J. E is crossing over. Segregation of alleles (J) would refer to the separation of alleles during meiosis, like in Mendel's law, but that's more about independent genes. Penetrance (A) is about the expression of a genotype into phenotype, not about recombination. Independent assortment (B) is about genes on different chromosomes. In this case, the genes are linked, so independent assortment doesn't apply. Genetic drift (C) is a random change in allele frequency, not relevant here. Incomplete dominance (D) is about blending of traits, not applicable. Codominance (G) is similar. Transcription error (I) is a mutation, but that's unlikely to explain a significant number of offspring. Non-disjunction (H) is about failure of chromosomes to separate, leading to aneuploidy, which probably doesn't explain the phenotype. Mutation (F) is a change in DNA, but again, unlikely to explain the presence of certain phenotypes in the progeny.

So, the only option that explains the recombinant phenotypes is crossing over (E). Therefore, the answer should be E.

The question involves a female fruit fly with linked genes for gray body and normal wings mating with a male fruit fly with black body and vestigial wings. The presence of gray-bodied, vestigial-winged progeny indicates that linked genes have been separated, which is best explained by crossing over. Crossing over occurs during meiosis when homologous chromosomes exchange genetic material, breaking the linkage between genes. This results in recombinant gametes, leading to the observed recombinant phenotypes. Other options, such as independent assortment, segregation of alleles, or mutation, do not adequately explain the recombination of linked genes. Therefore, the correct answer is:

E: crossing over

Answer: E
