Okay, so I need to determine whether the given argument is valid using indirect truth tables. The argument consists of two premises and a conclusion. Let me break it down step by step.

The premises are:
1. H is equivalent to (~I ∨ J). So, H ≡ (~I ∨ J).
2. H ∨ ~J.

The conclusion is: ~I.

First, I remember that an indirect truth table is used to check the validity of an argument. The method involves assuming the conclusion is false and then seeing if the premises can all be true at the same time. If they can, then the argument is invalid because we've found a counterexample. If not, the argument is valid.

So, let's set up the indirect truth table. I'll list all the possible truth values for the propositions involved, which are H, I, and J. Since there are three variables, there are 8 possible combinations.

The conclusion is ~I, so assuming the conclusion is false means I is true. So, I will fix I as true and then check the premises under this assumption.

Now, let's go through each possible scenario where I is true and see if the premises can both be true.

Premise 1: H ≡ (~I ∨ J). Since I is true, ~I is false. So, (~I ∨ J) becomes (false ∨ J), which simplifies to J. Therefore, H ≡ J. So, H must be equal to J in this case.

Premise 2: H ∨ ~J. Since H ≡ J, we can substitute H with J. So, H ∨ ~J becomes J ∨ ~J, which is always true because it's a tautology. So, Premise 2 is always true regardless of J's value when I is true.

Wait, that can't be right. Let me double-check. If H ≡ J, then H and J are the same. So, if H is true, J is true; if H is false, J is false.

So, looking at Premise 2: H ∨ ~J. If J is true, then ~J is false, so H must be true for the premise to hold. But since H ≡ J, if J is true, H is true, so H ∨ ~J is true. If J is false, then ~J is true, so H ∨ ~J is also true regardless of H's value because ~J is already true.

Wait, that means whenever I is true, both premises are automatically satisfied, regardless of H and J's values. That suggests that there's a situation where the premises are true and the conclusion is false, making the argument invalid.

Wait, but let me think again. The conclusion is ~I, which is false when I is true. So, in the case where I is true, the conclusion is false. Now, can the premises be true when I is true? Let's see.

If I is true, then H ≡ J. So H and J must be the same. Now, Premise 2 is H ∨ ~J. Since H and J are the same, let's consider two cases:

Case 1: H is true. Then J is true. So, Premise 2 becomes true ∨ false (since ~J is false), which is true.

Case 2: H is false. Then J is false. So, Premise 2 becomes false ∨ true (since ~J is true), which is also true.

So in both cases, when I is true, Premise 2 is true. Therefore, when I is true, both premises are true, and the conclusion is false. That means the argument is invalid because we've found a situation where premises are true and conclusion is false.

Now, looking at the options, I need to find which one presents a counterexample. A counterexample is a situation where the premises are true and the conclusion is false. So, when I is true, and H and J are such that H ≡ J, and H ∨ ~J is true.

Looking at the options:

A: Invalid. Counterexample when J is true and H and I are false. Wait, but I is true in the counterexample. So this can't be right because I is true, not false. So A is not correct.

B: Valid. No counterexample. But we found a counterexample, so B is wrong.

C: Invalid. Counterexample when H, I, and J are false. Let's see: If H, I, J are all false.

Premise1: H ≡ (~I ∨ J). I is false, so ~I is true. J is false. So ~I ∨ J is true ∨ false = true. So H must be true. But in this case, H is false. So Premise1 is false. Therefore, this is not a counterexample because the premises aren't both true. So C is incorrect.

D: Invalid. Counterexample when H and J are true and I is false. Let's check: I is false. So ~I is true. Premise1: H ≡ (~I ∨ J). H is true, ~I is true, J is true. So (~I ∨ J) is true. So H ≡ true, which is true. Premise2: H ∨ ~J. H is true, ~J is false. So true ∨ false is true. Conclusion: ~I is true. But in this case, I is false, so conclusion is true. Wait, but for a counterexample, the conclusion must be false. So this isn't a counterexample because conclusion is true when I is false. So D is not correct.

E: Invalid. Counterexample when H is true, I and J are false. Let's check: I is false, J is false.

Premise1: H ≡ (~I ∨ J). ~I is true, J is false. So (~I ∨ J) is true. H is true, so H ≡ true is true.

Premise2: H ∨ ~J. H is true, ~J is true. So true ∨ true is true.

Conclusion: ~I is true because I is false. So conclusion is true. Therefore, this is not a counterexample because the conclusion is true when the premises are true. So E is not correct.

F: Valid. No, because we have a counterexample, so F is wrong.

G: Invalid. Counterexample when I is true and H and J are false. Let's check: I is true. So ~I is false.

Premise1: H ≡ (~I ∨ J). H is false, ~I is false, J is false. So (~I ∨ J) is false ∨ false = false. So H ≡ false, which matches H being false. So Premise1 is true.

Premise2: H ∨ ~J. H is false, ~J is true. So false ∨ true = true. So Premise2 is true.

Conclusion: ~I is false because I is true. So conclusion is false. Therefore, this is a counterexample because both premises are true and conclusion is false. So G is a correct counterexample.

Wait, but earlier I thought that whenever I is true, the premises are true. So in this case, I is true, H and J are false.

Premise1: H ≡ (~I ∨ J). Since I is true, ~I is false. J is false. So ~I ∨ J is false ∨ false = false. H is false. So H ≡ false, which is true. So Premise1 is true.

Premise2: H ∨ ~J. H is false, ~J is true. So false ∨ true is true. So Premise2 is true.

Conclusion: ~I is false because I is true. So conclusion is false.

Yes, so this is a valid counterexample. So G is an option.

Wait, but earlier I thought that any case where I is true would satisfy the premises. So in G, I is true, H and J are false. That works.

Another option is H: Invalid. Counterexample when I is false and H and J are true.

Let me check H's option. I is false, H and J are true.

Premise1: H ≡ (~I ∨ J). I is false, so ~I is true. J is true. So (~I ∨ J) is true. H is true. So H ≡ true, which is true.

Premise2: H ∨ ~J. H is true, ~J is false. So true ∨ false is true.

Conclusion: ~I is true because I is false. So conclusion is true. Therefore, this isn't a counterexample because conclusion is true when premises are true. So H is not a counterexample.

Wait, but the question is to choose the correct option. So looking back, the correct counterexample is when I is true, and H and J are such that H ≡ J.

But in option G, I is true, H and J are false. So that's a case where both premises are true, and conclusion is false. So G is correct.

Wait, but wait another moment. Let me check all possibilities where I is true.

When I is true, H must be equal to J. So H and J have the same truth value.

So possible cases:

1. I=T, H=T, J=T.

Check premises:

Premise1: H ≡ (~I ∨ J). ~I is F, J=T. So F ∨ T = T. H=T. So H ≡ T, which is T.

Premise2: H ∨ ~J. H=T, ~J=F. So T ∨ F = T.

Conclusion: ~I=F.

So in this case, premises are true, conclusion is false. So this is a counterexample.

Another case: I=T, H=F, J=F.

Premise1: H ≡ (~I ∨ J). ~I=F, J=F. So F ∨ F=F. H=F. So H ≡ F, which is T.

Premise2: H ∨ ~J. H=F, ~J=T. So F ∨ T=T.

Conclusion: ~I=F.

So again, premises are true, conclusion is false.

So both these cases are counterexamples. Now, looking at the options, which one corresponds to these.

Option G is when I is true, H and J are false. That's the second case I just described.

Option H is when I is false, H and J are true. But that's when I is false, which doesn't apply because we're looking for cases where I is true.

Wait, but in the options, G is "Invalid. Counterexample when I is true and H and J are false." That's correct.

Another option, E: Invalid. Counterexample when H is true, I and J are false. But in that case, I is false, so conclusion is true. So E is not a counterexample.

So the correct answer is G.
</think>

The argument is invalid because we found a counterexample where the premises are true, and the conclusion is false. Specifically, when I is true, H and J are false, both premises hold, and the conclusion (~I) is false.
