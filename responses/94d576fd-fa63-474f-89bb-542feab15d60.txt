Okay, so I've got this problem to solve. I need to find the sum of the primes between 100 and 200, inclusive, that are either 1 or 2 more than a perfect square. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.

First, I think I should figure out what perfect squares are just below 100 and above 200 because the primes we're looking for are 1 or 2 more than these squares. Wait, no, actually, the primes are between 100 and 200, so the perfect squares must be such that when we add 1 or 2, the result is within that range. So the perfect squares themselves should be between 98 and 198 because 98 + 2 = 100 and 198 + 2 = 200. Wait, actually, let me think again. If the prime is 1 or 2 more than a square, then the square must be less than 200. Because the prime can be up to 200, so the square could be 199-1=198 or 199-2=197, but wait, 198 is not a perfect square. Let me list the perfect squares up to 199 because the square plus 1 or 2 has to be ≤200.

So, the perfect squares less than 200: let's see, 14^2 is 196, 15^2 is 225 which is over 200, so the squares we're considering are from 1^2 up to 14^2.

But since the primes are between 100 and 200, the squares that could lead to primes in that range would be those where the square is between 99 (since 99+1=100) and 198 (since 198+2=200). So the squares are from 10^2 (100) up to 14^2 (196), but let me check: 10^2 is 100, so adding 1 would be 101, which is within the range. 14^2 is 196, adding 2 gives 198, which is under 200. So the squares we need to consider are 10^2, 11^2, 12^2, 13^2, and 14^2.

Wait, but let's make sure. Let's list all perfect squares from 1^2=1 up to 14^2=196. Then, for each, add 1 and 2 to see if the result is a prime between 100 and 200.

So, let's list each square and compute n^2 +1 and n^2 +2, then check if those numbers are prime and fall within 100-200.

Let's start with n=10: 10^2=100. So 100+1=101 and 100+2=102. Are 101 and 102 primes? 101 is a prime, yes. 102 is even, so not a prime.

n=11: 121. So 121+1=122, 121+2=123. 122 is even, not prime. 123: 123 ÷3=41, so yes, 3×41=123, not prime.

n=12:144. 144+1=145, 144+2=146. 145 ends with 5, so divisible by 5, not prime. 146 is even, not prime.

n=13:169. 169+1=170, 169+2=171. 170 is even, 171: sum of digits is 9, so divisible by 9, not prime.

n=14:196. 196+1=197, 196+2=198. 197 is a prime. 198 is even, not prime.

Wait, but I think I missed some squares. Because n=9: 81. 81+1=82, which is below 100, so no. n=10 is the first where adding 1 gives 101, which is in the range. So the squares from n=10 to n=14 are the ones that could yield primes in 100-200 when 1 or 2 is added.

So from the above, the primes we have are 101 (from 10^2+1) and 197 (from 14^2+1). Are there any others? Let me check n=15: 225, which is over 200, so adding 1 would be 226, which is over 200, so no. So only 101 and 197 so far.

Wait, but let me double-check the squares. Did I miss any? Let's see:

n=1:1, n=2:4, n=3:9,... up to n=14:196. So for each n from 1 to 14, check n^2 +1 and n^2 +2, see if it's between 100-200 and prime.

Wait, perhaps I should check lower n as well, but only those where n^2 +2 >=100. Let me see: for n=10, 10^2=100, so 100+1=101, 100+2=102.

n=9:81. 81+2=83, which is below 100, so not in range. So n=10 is the first n where n^2 +1 is 101, which is within 100-200.

Wait, but let me check n=7: 49. 49+2=51, which is below 100. n=8:64. 64+2=66, still below 100. n=9:81. 81+2=83, below 100. So only from n=10 onwards.

So, for n=10: 101 (prime), 102 (not).

n=11:122 (not), 123 (not).

n=12:145 (not),146 (not).

n=13:170 (not),171 (not).

n=14:197 (prime),198 (not).

Wait, but wait, I think I might have missed a square. Let me check n=7 again: 49. 49+1=50, 49+2=51. No. n=8:64+1=65, 64+2=66. No. n=9:81+1=82, 81+2=83. No.

Wait, but what about n=15? 225 is over 200, so n=15 is out.

So, so far, I have 101 and 197 as primes that fit the criteria.

Wait, but let me check n=10 to n=14 again, perhaps I missed some.

n=10:100. 101 is prime, 102 not.

n=11:121. 122 is even, 123 is 3×41.

n=12:144. 145 is 5×29, 146 is even.

n=13:169. 170 even, 171 divisible by 9.

n=14:196. 197 prime, 198 even.

Wait, but wait, n=7:49. 49+1=50, no. n=8:64. 64+1=65 (5×13), 64+2=66 (even). n=9:81. 81+1=82 (even), 81+2=83 (prime, but 83 is below 100, so not in our range).

Wait, but what about n=16? 16^2=256, which is way over 200, so n=16 is out.

So the only primes in the range 100-200 that are 1 or 2 more than a perfect square are 101 and 197.

Wait, but is that all? Maybe I missed some. Let me think again.

Wait, n=5:25. 25+1=26, 25+2=27. No. n=6:36. 36+1=37, 36+2=38. No.

n=7:49. 50, 51. No.

n=8:64. 65, 66. No.

n=9:81. 82, 83. 83 is prime but below 100.

n=10:100. 101, 102. 101 is prime.

n=11:121. 122, 123.

n=12:144. 145, 146.

n=13:169. 170,171.

n=14:196. 197,198.

n=15:225. 226,227. 227 is prime, but 225 is over 200, so 226 is 225+1=226, which is over 200, so no.

Wait, but wait, 225 is over 200, but 225+1=226 is over, but 225 is 15^2, but 226 is over 200, so we don't consider it.

So, the primes are 101 and 197.

Wait, but wait another moment. Let me check n=10: 10^2=100, 100+1=101, which is prime.

n=11:121+1=122, not prime.

n=12:144+1=145, not prime.

n=13:169+1=170, not prime.

n=14:196+1=197, prime.

n=10:100+2=102, not prime.

n=11:121+2=123, not prime.

n=12:144+2=146, not prime.

n=13:169+2=171, not prime.

n=14:196+2=198, not prime.

So, only 101 and 197 are primes in the range that are 1 or 2 more than a perfect square.

Wait, but wait, what about n=16? 16^2=256, which is way over 200, so no.

Wait, but let me think again. Could there be any other squares between 100 and 200 that when you add 1 or 2, you get a prime within 100-200?

Wait, perhaps I missed some squares. Let me list all squares from n=10 to n=14:

n=10:100

n=11:121

n=12:144

n=13:169

n=14:196

So, 100, 121, 144, 169, 196.

Adding 1: 101, 122, 145, 170, 197.

Adding 2: 102, 123, 146, 171, 198.

Now, check which of these are primes.

101: prime.

122: even, no.

145: ends with 5, divisible by 5, no.

170: even, no.

197: prime.

102: even, no.

123: sum of digits 6, divisible by 3, no.

146: even, no.

171: sum of digits 9, divisible by 9, no.

198: even, no.

So yes, only 101 and 197.

Wait, but is there any other square that when adding 1 or 2 gives a prime between 100 and 200? Let me think: for example, n=17: 289. 289+1=290, which is over 200, so no.

n=16:256, which is over 200, so no.

n=7:49, 49+2=51, which is below 100.

So, no, only 101 and 197.

So the sum is 101 + 197 = 298.

Looking at the options, option G is 298.

Wait, but let me double-check: 101 + 197 is indeed 298.

Yes, so the answer should be G:298.
</think>

The primes between 100 and 200 that are 1 or 2 more than a perfect square are 101 and 197. Their sum is 298.
