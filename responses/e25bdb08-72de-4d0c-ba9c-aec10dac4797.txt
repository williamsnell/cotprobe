Okay, so I've got this question about an unknown substance and I need to figure out what kind of bonding it has. Let's break down the information given. 

First, the substance has a high melting point. High melting points usually mean that the bonds between the particles are strong and require a lot of energy to break. So I should think about which types of bonds are strong.

Next, it's a poor conductor of electricity. That makes me think it's not a metal because metals are good conductors. So metallic bonding is probably not the answer. Also, if it's not conducting, it might not have ions moving around, so ionic bonding might not be it either, but wait, ionic compounds can conduct when melted or in solution. Hmm.

It also doesn't dissolve in water. Substances that don't dissolve in water often have bonds that are not easily broken by water. Ionic compounds usually dissolve because water can break apart the ions, but if it doesn't dissolve, maybe the bonds are too strong or it's nonpolar. But wait, the substance is a poor conductor, which might suggest it's not ionic because ionic compounds can conduct when they're in solution or molten, but if it's solid, maybe not. But if it's not dissolving, maybe it's covalent.

Now, considering the bonding options. Let's go through each option:

A: Dipole-dipole bonding. That's a type of intermolecular force, not the primary bonding in the substance itself. The question is about the substance's composition, so maybe not the right choice.

B: Ionic bonding. Ionic compounds form crystals with high melting points. They usually conduct electricity when melted or dissolved, but in solid form, they don't conduct. But if the substance doesn't dissolve in water, maybe it's not ionic. Hmm, conflicting thoughts.

C: Covalent network bonding. Covalent network, like diamond or graphene, has strong covalent bonds forming a giant lattice. These have very high melting points because you need to break all those bonds to melt them. They don't conduct electricity because the electrons are tightly bound, so they're insulators. That fits with high melting point and poor conductor. Also, such substances don't dissolve in water because they're not ions and the structure is too strong. So this seems like a good candidate.

D: Nonpolar covalent bonding. Nonpolar covalent substances have weak London dispersion forces. They usually have low melting points and are gases or liquids. But the question says high melting point, so this doesn't fit.

E: Coordinate covalent bonding. That's a type of bond where both electrons come from one atom. Not sure about the melting point and conductivity. Probably not the primary bonding type here.

F: London dispersion bonding. These are weak intermolecular forces, leading to low melting points. Doesn't fit with high melting point.

G: Van der Waals bonding. Similar to London dispersion, but generally weaker than dipole-dipole. Also low melting points, so not matching.

H: Metallic bonding. Metals conduct electricity well because the delocalized electrons can move freely. But the substance is a poor conductor, so this is unlikely.

I: Hydrogen bonding. Hydrogen bonds are stronger than van der Waals but weaker than covalent. Substances with H-bonds can have higher melting points than those without, but not as high as covalent networks. Also, hydrogen bonds are intermolecular, not the bonding within the substance itself.

J: Polar covalent bonding. Polar covalent bonds can form molecules that have dipole-dipole interactions. These usually have higher melting points than nonpolar, but not as high as network covalent. Also, polar covalent substances might dissolve in water if they're polar enough, but the question says it doesn't dissolve. So maybe not.

Putting it all together: High melting point, poor conductor, doesn't dissolve in water. Covalent network bonding fits because it's a giant structure with strong bonds, doesn't conduct (since electrons are localized), and won't dissolve in water as it's not made of ions or polar molecules. So the answer should be C.
</think>

The substance has a high melting point, indicating strong bonds that require significant energy to break. It is a poor conductor of electricity, suggesting it lacks free-moving electrons, which rules out ionic and metallic bonding. Additionally, it does not dissolve in water, implying it is not ionic or polar. Covalent network bonding, such as in diamond or graphene, forms a giant lattice with strong covalent bonds, resulting in high melting points, poor conductivity, and insolubility in water. This matches all the given properties.

Answer: C
