Okay, so I'm trying to answer this question about Hersey and Blanchard's Situational Leadership Model. I remember that this model talks about how a leader's style should adapt based on the situation, specifically considering the maturity of the subordinates. The question is about the Delegating Style, so I need to think about what that entails.

First, I recall that Hersey and Blanchard describe four main leadership styles: Directive, Coach, Supportive, and Delegating. Each style has different levels of task and relationship orientation. Task orientation is about focusing on the work and its structure, while relationship orientation is about building relationships and providing support.

The Delegating Style is supposed to be used when subordinates are highly mature. High maturity means they're capable and confident, so the leader doesn't need to be as involved. In this case, the leader would delegate tasks and give more autonomy. So, if the subordinates are mature, the leader's task orientation would be low because the tasks are handled by the subordinates. Relationship orientation would also be low because the leader doesn't need to focus much on relationships since the subordinates are self-sufficient.

Looking at the options, I need to find the one that has low task and low relationship orientation. Let me go through each option:

A: High task and high relationship – That sounds like a more supportive style, maybe when subordinates are somewhat mature but still need some guidance.

B: High task and low relationship – This might be Directive style, where the leader focuses on tasks but doesn't build much relationship.

C: Moderate in both – I'm not sure when this would apply. Maybe when subordinates are developing but not fully mature.

D: No relationship and high task – Similar to B, perhaps Directive again.

E: Low task and low relationship – This fits with Delegating, as the leader isn't focusing on tasks or relationships much.

F: No in both – Maybe a hands-off approach, but I'm not sure if that's exactly Delegating.

G: High relationship and no task – That doesn't seem right because if the leader is high in relationships, they might be using a different style.

H: Low task and high relationship – This might be Supportive, where the leader focuses on relationships but not so much on tasks.

I: High task and no relationship – Again, sounds like Directive.

J: Moderate task and high relationship – Maybe when subordinates need some support and guidance.

So, the Delegating Style should be E: low task and low relationship. That makes sense because the leader delegates and doesn't need to be involved in tasks or relationships much.

The Delegating Style in Hersey and Blanchard’s model is characterized by low task and low relationship orientation, as subordinates are highly mature and capable.
