Okay, so I've got this question about blood types and probabilities. Hmm, let me think. I remember that blood types are determined by the ABO alleles. Each person has two alleles, one from each parent. The possible blood types are A, B, AB, and O.

The question says one parent has type B blood, and the other has type AB. I need to find the probability that their child has type O blood.

Wait, type B has genotype either BB or BO, right? And type AB is always AB because they have both A and B alleles. So, the AB parent can only pass on either A or B to the child.

Let me break it down. The AB parent can give either A or B. The B parent can give either B or O, assuming they're heterozygous. Wait, no, wait. Wait, type B can be either BB or BO. Oh, but if the B parent is type B, they might be either homozygous (BB) or heterozygous (BO). Hmm, but I think when a parent is type B, without more info, we assume they're heterozygous, so their genotype is BO.

Wait, no, actually, type B can be either BB or BO. But the probability for each depends on whether the parents are carriers or not. But in this case, since one parent is AB and the other is B, I need to figure out all possible combinations.

So, the AB parent can pass A or B. The B parent can pass B or O, assuming they're heterozygous. So the possible combinations would be:

AB parent gives A, B parent gives B → child has AB? Wait, no. Wait, the child's blood type is determined by the combination of alleles. So, let's list all possible combinations.

AB parent's alleles: A and B, so gametes are A or B.

B parent's alleles: Let's say they're BO, so gametes are B or O.

So the possible children would be:

A (from AB) + B (from B) → AB
A + O → AO → which is type A
B + B → BB → type B
B + O → BO → type B

Wait, but wait. Wait, no, if the B parent is BB, then they can only give B. But if the B parent is BO, they can give B or O.

Wait, but the question doesn't specify whether the B parent is homozygous or heterozygous. Oh, wait, but in general, for blood types, type B could be either BB or BO. So, without more info, we might have to assume that the B parent is heterozygous, i.e., BO, because if they were homozygous BB, they can't pass O. But I'm not entirely sure. Hmm.

Wait, but in reality, type B can be either. So, perhaps I should consider both possibilities. But I think the standard approach is to assume that the B parent is heterozygous (BO) unless stated otherwise.

So, assuming B parent is BO, their gametes are B (50%) and O (50%).

So, the AB parent's gametes are A (50%) and B (50%).

So, combining these:

- 50% (A) * 50% (B) = 25% chance of AB (A from AB, B from B)
- 50% (A) * 50% (O) = 25% chance of AO (A and O → type A)
- 50% (B) * 50% (B) = 25% chance of BB (type B)
- 50% (B) * 50% (O) = 25% chance of BO (type B)

Wait, but that adds up to 100%: 25% +25% +25% +25%. So each combination is 25%.

Wait, but the possible blood types would be:

AB: 25% (from A and B)
A: 25% (from A and O)
B: 50% (since BB is 25% and BO is 25% → both type B)
O: 0% because there's no way to get O. Because the O allele would have to come from both parents, but the AB parent can't give O. Wait, no, the AB parent can only give A or B, and the B parent can give O only if they're BO.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The child's genotype would be a combination of one allele from each parent.

If the child gets O from the B parent (BO gives O) and A from AB parent: AO → type A.

If the child gets O and B: BO → type B.

If the child gets A and B: AB → type AB.

If the child gets B and B: BB → type B.

Wait, but the only way the child can have O is if both parents give O. But the AB parent can't give O because their alleles are A and B. So, the AB parent can't give O. So the child can't get O from the AB parent. Therefore, the child can't have O blood type, because O requires two O alleles, one from each parent. Since the AB parent can't give O, the child can't have O.

So the probability is zero.

The probability that the child has type O blood is **0%** because the AB parent can only contribute the A or B allele, and the B parent can only contribute the B or O allele. Since the child needs two O alleles (one from each parent) to have type O blood, and the AB parent cannot contribute an O allele, it is impossible for the child to have type O blood.
