Okay, so I have this question about convex sets and their properties when expanded by a distance 'a'. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the question defines S_a as the set of all points x such that the distance from x to the set S is less than or equal to a. The distance here is defined as the infimum of the norms of x minus y for y in S. So, S_a is like an "a-neighborhood" around the set S. 

The main question is whether S_a is convex if S is convex. Convexity means that for any two points in the set, the line segment connecting them is entirely within the set. So, I need to check if this holds for S_a.

I remember that taking a neighborhood around a convex set doesn't necessarily preserve convexity, but wait, I might be mixing things up. Let me think. If S is convex, then S_a is the union of all balls of radius a centered at points in S. So, S_a is the Minkowski sum of S with a closed ball of radius a. 

Wait, isn't the Minkowski sum of a convex set with a convex set (like a ball) also convex? Because a ball is convex, and the Minkowski sum of two convex sets is convex. So if S is convex, then S_a should be convex too. 

But wait, I'm not entirely sure. Let me consider a specific example. Suppose S is a line segment in R^2. Then S_a would be a rectangle with rounded ends, which is still convex. Another example: if S is a convex polygon, S_a would be the polygon expanded by a distance a in all directions, which is also convex. 

Alternatively, consider S as a convex function's epigraph; expanding it by a should still keep it convex. So, based on these examples and the Minkowski sum reasoning, S_a should be convex if S is convex.

Wait, but I'm supposed to return 1 for yes and 0 for no. So, the answer should be 1, which in the options is D: 1.0.

The set \( S_a \) is the Minkowski sum of the convex set \( S \) with a ball of radius \( a \), which is convex. Therefore, \( S_a \) is convex.
