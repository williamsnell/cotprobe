Okay, so I have to figure out which article of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact was violated by Operation Barbarossa. Let me start by understanding the question and the context.

First, the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact was signed in 1939 between the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany. It had several articles, and the question is about which one was broken when Operation Barbarossa happened.

Operation Barbarossa was the code name for Nazi Germany's invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941. So, I need to look at what the Pact said and see what Operation Barbarossa did that would violate it.

Looking at the articles:

- Article I: Both parties agreed to desist from any act of violence, aggressive actions, or attacks on each other. So if Germany attacked the USSR, that's a direct violation of Article I.

- Article II: If one party was attacked by a third power, the other shouldn't support that third power. But in this case, it's about the attack itself, not about supporting another country.

- Article III: They agreed to maintain continual contact for consultations on common interests. If they stopped consulting, that could be a violation, but the main issue here is the invasion.

- Article IV: If disputes arise, they shouldn't join any group aimed at the other. But again, the main issue is the attack itself.

- Article V: Disputes should be settled through friendly talks or arbitration. But the invasion was a direct military action, so this might not apply directly.

So, Operation Barbarossa was a direct military invasion by Germany into the USSR. That's an aggressive act against each other, which directly violates Article I. Additionally, Article II says that if one is attacked by a third party, the other shouldn't support that third party. But in this case, it's Germany attacking the USSR, so maybe it's more about Article I.

Wait, but let me think again. The Pact was a non-aggression treaty. So any aggressive action by either side would break Article I. Since Germany launched the invasion, they violated Article I.

Looking at the options, option A is Article I. Option J is Article I and II. But did Operation Barbarossa also violate Article II? Article II says if one is attacked by a third power, the other shouldn't support that third party. But in this case, Germany was the aggressor, not the defender. So perhaps Article II wasn't directly violated because it's about supporting a third party when one is attacked, not initiating the attack.

So the main violation is Article I. Therefore, the correct answer should be A: Article I.

The correct answer is A: Article I. Operation Barbarossa was a direct aggressive act by Germany against the Soviet Union, violating Article I of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact.
