Okay, let's try to solve this problem step by step. So, the question is about finding the cost of one pencil in cents. 

First, I'll read the problem again to make sure I understand it correctly. It says that eleven pencils cost as much as three pens. Then, it tells me that seven pens cost $9.24. I need to find the cost of one pencil in cents.

Hmm, so let's break this down. I think the first step is to find out the cost of one pen. If seven pens cost $9.24, then each pen should cost that amount divided by seven. 

Let me calculate that: $9.24 divided by 7. Well, 7 goes into 9 once, with 2 remaining. 7 into 24 is 3 times, because 3*7 is 21, which leaves a remainder of 3. Wait, but wait, no, 24 divided by 7 is 3 with 3 left over. So that would make it 1.32 dollars per pen? Wait, no, that can't be right because 7 times 1.32 is 9.24. Let me check that: 1.32 * 7. 7*1 is 7, 7*0.3 is 2.1, 7*0.02 is 0.14. Adding those up: 7 + 2.1 is 9.1, plus 0.14 is 9.24. Yep, that's correct. So each pen costs $1.32.

Wait, the question asks for the cost in cents, so I'll convert that to cents. Since $1 is 100 cents, $1.32 is 132 cents per pen.

Now, the problem says that eleven pencils cost as much as three pens. So, the cost of eleven pencils equals the cost of three pens. Let me write that as an equation. Let Pencil cost be 'p' cents each, and Pen cost is 132 cents each.

So, 11p = 3 * 132.

I can calculate 3 * 132 first. 3 * 100 is 300, 3*30 is 90, 3*2 is 6. Adding those up: 300 + 90 is 390, plus 6 is 396. So, 11p = 396 cents.

To find the cost of one pencil, I need to divide both sides by 11. So, p = 396 / 11. Let me do that division. 11 goes into 39 three times (11*3=33), subtract 33 from 39, we get 6. Bring down the 6, making it 66. 11 goes into 66 exactly six times (11*6=66). So, p = 36. 

Wait, 36 cents per pencil? Let me check the math again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

So, 7 pens cost $9.24, which is 924 cents. Each pen is 924 / 7 = 132 cents. That's correct. Then, 3 pens would cost 3 * 132 = 396 cents. So, 11 pencils equal 396 cents. Therefore, each pencil is 396 / 11 = 36 cents. 

Looking at the options, J is 36. So the answer should be J.
