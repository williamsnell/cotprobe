Options:

A: Energy is evenly distributed among all organisms in an ecosystem.
B: All organisms in an ecosystem receive the same amount of energy.

E: The amount of energy transferred from one trophic level to the next is constant.
F: Energy flow between trophic levels is 100% efficient.
G: Smaller organisms need less energy per gram of body weight than do larger organisms.
H: Energy is transferred from consumers to producers.
I: Energy flow in an ecosystem is cyclical.
J: Energy flow between trophic levels is inefficient.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the flow of energy in ecosystems. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is asking which statement is true about the flow of energy. The options are from A to J. Let's go through each one and see which makes sense.

Option A: Energy is evenly distributed among all organisms. Hmm, I don't think that's right. In an ecosystem, usually, energy isn't spread out evenly. Producers like plants have more because they take in the sunlight, while consumers get energy from what they eat. So A might not be correct.

Option B: All organisms receive the same amount of energy. That doesn't sound right either. Different organisms have different roles. For example, a grass plant (producer) gets energy from the sun, while a deer (consumer) gets it from eating the grass. They don't get the same amount, so B is probably wrong.

Option C: Energy transfer involves conservation of heat. Wait, energy transfer usually results in some loss as heat, right? Because only about 10% of energy is transferred to the next trophic level. So conservation of heat doesn't sound right. Maybe it's more about losing energy as heat, not conserving it. So C might not be correct.

Option D: Chemical energy is converted into radiant, then back into chemical. That doesn't seem right. Producers like plants convert sunlight (radiant) into chemical energy. Then, when a herbivore eats the plant, it uses that chemical energy. So it's more like radiant to chemical, not the other way around. So D is probably incorrect.

Option E: The amount transferred between levels is constant. I remember that each transfer loses most of the energy as heat, so the amount isn't constant. It decreases each time. So E is wrong.

Option F: Energy transfer is 100% efficient. No, that's not true. I've heard that only about 10% is transferred, so efficiency is low, not 100%. So F is incorrect.

Option G: Smaller organisms need less energy per gram than larger ones. Wait, I think smaller organisms might actually need more energy per gram because they have higher metabolic rates. Like how a shrew needs a lot of food relative to its size. So G is probably wrong.

Option H: Energy flows from consumers to producers. That doesn't make sense because in a food chain, energy goes from producers to consumers, not the other way around. Unless decomposers are involved, but even then, they break down organic matter and release energy, not transfer it back. So H is incorrect.

Option I: Energy flow is cyclical. No, energy flow in ecosystems isn't cyclical. It starts with the sun and flows through the ecosystem, eventually dissipating as heat. It doesn't cycle like matter does (biogeochemical cycles). So I is wrong.

Option J: Energy transfer between levels is inefficient. Yes, this rings a bell. I remember that energy transfer is inefficient, with only about 10% being passed on. So J is correct.

Wait, let me double-check. The options are about true statements. So J says the transfer is inefficient, which is correct because a lot is lost as heat. So the correct answer should be J.

The correct answer is J. The flow of energy between trophic levels is inefficient because only a small fraction of the energy is transferred, with the majority lost as heat. 

Answer: J
