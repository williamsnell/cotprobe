Okay, so I'm trying to solve this investment wheel problem. The strategy given is (γ, 0, 0), and I need to find the value of γ that maximizes the overall factor after n steps. The factor is given as (1+2γ)^(n/2) multiplied by (1-γ)^(n/2). Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, I think I should simplify the overall factor expression. Let me write it out: (1+2γ)^(n/2) * (1-γ)^(n/2). Since both terms are raised to the power of n/2, I can combine them by multiplying the bases. So, that would be [(1+2γ)(1-γ)]^(n/2).

Let me compute the product inside the brackets. (1+2γ)(1-γ) equals 1*(1) + 1*(-γ) + 2γ*(1) + 2γ*(-γ). Calculating each term: 1 - γ + 2γ - 2γ². Combining like terms, that's 1 + γ - 2γ². So the overall factor becomes (1 + γ - 2γ²) raised to the power of n/2.

Now, to maximize the overall factor, I need to maximize the base of the exponent, which is (1 + γ - 2γ²). Because if the base is larger, then raising it to any positive power will make it bigger. So the problem reduces to finding the value of γ that maximizes the quadratic function f(γ) = 1 + γ - 2γ².

Since this is a quadratic function in terms of γ, it's a downward-opening parabola (because the coefficient of γ² is negative). The maximum occurs at the vertex of the parabola. The formula for the vertex (maximum point) in a quadratic equation ax² + bx + c is at x = -b/(2a). Here, a is -2, and b is 1. So substituting, γ = -1/(2*(-2)) = -1 / (-4) = 1/4. So γ should be 0.25.

Wait, let me double-check that. The function is f(γ) = -2γ² + γ + 1. So a = -2, b = 1. So the vertex is at γ = -b/(2a) = -1/(2*(-2)) = 1/4, which is 0.25. That makes sense because the coefficient of γ² is negative, so the parabola opens downward, and the vertex is the maximum.

So the value of γ that maximizes the factor is 0.25, which is option B.

The strategy involves maximizing the factor (1+γ - 2γ²)^(n/2), which is achieved when γ is 0.25.

Answer: B
