Alright, so I've got this problem here about finding the system function H(jω) and the impulse response h(t) of a one-port network. The input voltage is given as v_i(t) = 100cos(ω_o t) volts, and the input current I_i(jω) is provided as 100π [δ(ω + ω_o) + δ(ω - ω_o)] multiplied by (1 - j)/(2ω). I need to select the correct impulse response from options A to J.

Hmm, okay, let's break this down. I remember that the system function H(jω) is the ratio of the output voltage to the input current in the frequency domain, right? So H(jω) = V_out(jω) / I_in(jω). But wait, in this case, the input voltage is given, and the input current is provided. So maybe I should be considering H(jω) as V_i(jω) / I_i(jω), which would make sense because H is the transfer function from the input current to the input voltage.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the question says H(jω) = V_i(jω) / I_i(jω). So that's correct. So H(jω) is the ratio of the input voltage to the input current in the frequency domain.

So first, I need to find H(jω) = V_i(jω) / I_i(jω).

Given that v_i(t) = 100 cos(ω_o t). The Fourier transform of cos(ω_o t) is (π [δ(ω - ω_o) + δ(ω + ω_o)]). So V_i(jω) would be 100 times that. So V_i(jω) = 100π [δ(ω - ω_o) + δ(ω + ω_o)].

And I_i(jω) is given as 100π [δ(ω + ω_o) + δ(ω - ω_o)] multiplied by (1 - j)/(2ω). So the expression for I_i(jω) is 100π * [δ(ω + ω_o) + δ(ω - ω_o)] * (1 - j)/(2ω).

So when I take H(jω) = V_i(jω) / I_i(jω), the 100π terms will cancel out. So H(jω) would be [100π (δ(ω - ω_o) + δ(ω + ω_o))] divided by [100π (δ(ω + ω_o) + δ(ω - ω_o)) * (1 - j)/(2ω) ) ].

Simplifying, the 100π terms cancel, and the δ terms are the same in numerator and denominator, so they cancel as well. So H(jω) = 1 / [ (1 - j)/(2ω) ) ] = 2ω / (1 - j).

Hmm, but wait, that seems a bit off because I think I might have missed some steps. Let me double-check.

Wait, perhaps I should be more precise. Let me write it out:

V_i(jω) = 100 * π [δ(ω - ω_o) + δ(ω + ω_o)].

I_i(jω) = 100π [δ(ω + ω_o) + δ(ω - ω_o)] * (1 - j)/(2ω).

So when I compute H(jω) = V_i / I_i, the 100π terms cancel, and the δ terms are the same in both, so they cancel as well. So I'm left with H(jω) = 1 / [ (1 - j)/(2ω) ) ] = (2ω) / (1 - j).

Wait, but that seems to leave H(jω) as (2ω) / (1 - j). But that's in the frequency domain. Now, to find the impulse response h(t), I need to take the inverse Fourier transform of H(jω).

But wait, let me think again. H(jω) is (2ω)/(1 - j). Hmm, perhaps I should express this differently. Let me factor out the denominator's 1 - j as (1 - j) = sqrt(2) e^{-j π/4}, but maybe that's complicating things.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to write H(jω) as (2ω) / (1 - j) and then find its inverse Fourier transform.

Wait, but the inverse Fourier transform of ω/(1 - j) would involve some exponential terms, perhaps?

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-express H(jω).

Wait, another approach: Let's see, H(jω) is V_i(jω) / I_i(jω), which is [100π (δ(ω - ω_o) + δ(ω + ω_o))] divided by [100π (δ(ω + ω_o) + δ(ω - ω_o)) * (1 - j)/(2ω)].

So that's [1 / ( (1 - j)/(2ω) ) ] because the δ terms are the same in numerator and denominator, so they cancel. So H(jω) = 2ω / (1 - j).

Wait, but that simplifies to H(jω) = (2ω)/(1 - j).

Hmm, but that's a function of ω, not of jω. Let me check: Wait, jω is the variable, so perhaps I should write ω as (jω), but that doesn't make sense. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the algebra.

Wait, perhaps I should treat H(jω) as a function of jω. Let me write H(jω) = (2ω)/(1 - j). Wait, but ω is a variable here, so perhaps I should express this differently. Alternatively, perhaps I should factor out the (1 - j) term.

Wait, 1 - j can be written as sqrt(2) e^{-j π/4}, but I'm not sure if that helps. Alternatively, perhaps I can write H(jω) = (2ω) (1 + j)/( (1 - j)(1 + j) ) ) = (2ω)(1 + j)/(1 + 1) ) = (2ω)(1 + j)/2 = ω (1 + j).

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps I should rationalize the denominator by multiplying numerator and denominator by (1 + j):

H(jω) = [2ω (1 + j)] / [ (1 - j)(1 + j) ) ] = [2ω (1 + j)] / (1 + 1) ) = [2ω (1 + j)] / 2 = ω (1 + j).

Hmm, maybe that's better. So H(jω) = ω (1 + j).

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation. Let me try again.

Given that I_i(jω) = 100π [δ(ω + ω_o) + δ(ω - ω_o)] * (1 - j)/(2ω).

So I_i(jω) = 100π * (1 - j)/(2ω) * [δ(ω + ω_o) + δ(ω - ω_o)].

Then V_i(jω) = 100 * π [δ(ω + ω_o) + δ(ω - ω_o)].

So H(jω) = V_i / I_i = [100π (δ + δ)] / [100π (1-j)/(2ω) (δ + δ)].

So the 100π and δ terms cancel out, so H(jω) = 1 / [ (1 - j)/(2ω) ) ] = 2ω/(1 - j).

Wait, that's the same as before. So H(jω) = 2ω/(1 - j).

Hmm, now I need to find h(t) which is the inverse Fourier transform of H(jω).

Wait, but H(jω) = (2ω)/(1 - j) can be rewritten. Let me factor out the constants:

Let me write H(jω) = (2/(1 - j)) * ω.

But ω is the variable, so perhaps I can see this as H(jω) = (2/(1 - j)) * j * (jω) / j.

Wait, no, that's getting a bit confusing. Alternatively, perhaps I can express ω in terms of jω.

Wait, ω is a variable, but jω is the variable in the Fourier transform. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider H(jω) as (2/(1 - j)) * ω.

Now, the inverse Fourier transform of ω is a bit tricky. Let me think: The Fourier transform of e^{-at} u(t) is 1/(jω + a). So perhaps I can find a function whose Fourier transform is ω/(1 - j).

Wait, but H(jω) is (2/(1 - j)) * ω, so I can write it as (2/(1 - j)) * ω = (2/(1 - j)) * (j * (jω)) / j.

Wait, maybe that's not helpful. Alternatively, perhaps I can write H(jω) as (2/(1 - j)) * ω = (2/(1 - j)) * (j (jω)) / j.

Hmm, perhaps it's better to think in terms of known Fourier transform pairs. Let me consider that H(jω) = (2/(1 - j)) * ω.

Wait, perhaps I can express this as H(jω) = (2/(1 - j)) * (j (jω)) / j. Wait, but jω is the variable, so perhaps that's not the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write H(jω) = (2/(1 - j)) * j * (jω) / j^2. Hmm, perhaps this is getting too convoluted.

Wait, maybe I should take a different approach. Let's consider the Fourier transform of h(t). The Fourier transform of e^{-at} u(t) is 1/(jω + a). So if I have a term like ω, perhaps I can relate it to the derivative of some other function.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the duality property. The Fourier transform of t is -j δ'(ω), but that might not help here.

Wait, another approach: H(jω) = 2ω/(1 - j) = (2/(1 - j)) * ω.

So let's factor out the constants. Let me write it as H(jω) = (2/(1 - j)) * ω.

Now, the inverse Fourier transform of ω is the derivative of the delta function, but perhaps that's not useful here.

Wait, perhaps I should write H(jω) as (2/(1 - j)) * ω = (2/(1 - j)) * j (jω).

Wait, because jω is the variable, so jω = j * (jω) ?

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me consider that H(jω) = (2/(1 - j)) * ω.

To find h(t), I need to compute the inverse Fourier transform of H(jω). Let's write H(jω) as H(jω) = 2/(1 - j) * ω.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the inverse transform of ω. Let me think about it differently. Let me consider H(jω) = (2/(1 - j)) * ω.

Let me write this as H(jω) = (2/(1 - j)) * (j (jω)).

Wait, but jω is the variable, so perhaps I'm trying to express this in terms of jω.

Alternatively, perhaps I can rewrite H(jω) as H(jω) = (2/(1 - j)) * (jω) / j.

Wait, because ω = (jω)/j, right? So that would make H(jω) = (2/(1 - j)) * (jω) / j = (2/(1 - j)) * (jω) * (1/j) ) = (2/(1 - j)) * ω.

Wait, that just brings me back to the same expression. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write H(jω) = (2/(1 - j)) * ω = (2/(1 - j)) * (j (jω)) / j.

Wait, perhaps I can factor out j:

H(jω) = (2/(1 - j)) * j * (jω) / j^2.

Wait, j^2 is -1, so this would be (2/(1 - j)) * j * (jω) / (-1).

Hmm, but this seems to complicate things further. Maybe I should consider looking for a function whose Fourier transform is proportional to ω.

Wait, I recall that the Fourier transform of e^{-at} u(t) is 1/(jω + a). So, perhaps if I take the derivative with respect to a, I can get a term involving ω.

Let me compute the derivative of 1/(jω + a) with respect to a:

d/da [1/(jω + a)] = -1/(jω + a)^2.

Hmm, but that's not directly helpful. Alternatively, perhaps I can think about the time domain function that would have a Fourier transform involving ω.

Wait, perhaps I can express H(jω) as H(jω) = (2/(1 - j)) * ω = (2/(1 - j)) * (j (jω)).

Wait, but jω is the variable, so perhaps the inverse transform of (jω) is something like -j 2π δ'(t), but that's probably not useful here.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use partial fraction decomposition or another method.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier in calculating H(jω). Let me go back.

H(jω) = V_i(jω) / I_i(jω).

V_i(jω) = 100π [δ(ω - ω_o) + δ(ω + ω_o)].

I_i(jω) = 100π [δ(ω + ω_o) + δ(ω - ω_o)] * (1 - j)/(2ω).

So when I take the ratio, the 100π terms cancel, and the δ terms are the same in numerator and denominator, so they cancel as well. So H(jω) = 1 / [ (1 - j)/(2ω) ) ] = 2ω/(1 - j).

Wait, that seems correct. So H(jω) = 2ω/(1 - j).

Now, to find h(t), the impulse response, I need to compute the inverse Fourier transform of H(jω).

Hmm, perhaps I can write H(jω) as H(jω) = (2/(1 - j)) * ω.

Let me factor out the 2/(1 - j) as a constant and focus on the ω term.

Wait, the Fourier transform of t is proportional to the derivative of the delta function, but I'm not sure that helps here.

Wait, perhaps I can think of H(jω) as (2/(1 - j)) * ω, which can be written as (2/(1 - j)) * (j (jω)).

Wait, but jω is the variable, so maybe I can write this as (2/(1 - j)) * (j (jω)) = (2j/(1 - j)) * (jω).

Wait, but jω is the variable, so this would mean that H(jω) = (2j/(1 - j)) * (jω).

Hmm, but I'm not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps I can rewrite H(jω) as (2/(1 - j)) * ω = (2/(1 - j)) * (j * (jω)) / j.

Wait, because j * (jω) = j^2 ω = -ω, so that approach might not be useful.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that H(jω) = (2/(1 - j)) * ω = (2/(1 - j)) * (j (jω)).

Then, since jω is the variable, perhaps I can write H(jω) as (2/(1 - j)) * j * (jω).

Wait, but that's (2j/(1 - j)) * (jω).

Hmm, perhaps I can recognize this as a form of the Fourier transform of an exponential function.

Wait, let's think about the Fourier transform of e^{-at} u(t), which is 1/(jω + a).

If I take the inverse Fourier transform of (jω)/(jω + a), that would be e^{-at} (1 - e^{-at}) u(t), perhaps? I'm not entirely sure, but maybe I can use that idea.

Wait, but in this case, H(jω) is (2/(1 - j)) * ω, which is (2/(1 - j)) * (jω) / j.

Wait, because ω = (jω)/j, so H(jω) = (2/(1 - j)) * (jω)/j = (2/(j(1 - j))) * (jω).

Wait, but that might not help. Alternatively, perhaps I can write H(jω) = (2/(1 - j)) * ω = (2/(1 - j)) * (j (jω)).

Hmm, perhaps I can think of H(jω) as (2j/(1 - j)) * (jω).

Wait, but jω is the variable, so perhaps I can write this as H(jω) = (2j/(1 - j)) * (jω).

Hmm, but I'm not sure how to proceed from here. Maybe I should consider the system's response to an impulse.

Wait, another approach: Since the input is v_i(t) = 100 cos(ω_o t), which is a cosine function, and the output current is given, perhaps I can use the concept of impedance. The system function H(jω) would be the ratio of voltage to current, so it's the impedance.

But I'm not sure if that helps directly in finding the impulse response. Alternatively, perhaps I can think about the system's response to an impulse, which would be the impulse response h(t).

Wait, maybe I can consider that H(jω) = 2ω/(1 - j).

Let me rewrite H(jω) as H(jω) = (2/(1 - j)) * ω.

Now, the inverse Fourier transform of ω would be something involving the derivative of the delta function, but perhaps that's not helpful here.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write H(jω) as H(jω) = (2/(1 - j)) * j (jω).

Wait, jω is the variable, so that would make H(jω) = (2j/(1 - j)) * (jω).

Hmm, the Fourier transform of e^{-at} is 1/(jω + a), so perhaps if I can express H(jω) in terms of 1/(jω + a), then I can find h(t).

Wait, let's try to manipulate H(jω):

H(jω) = (2/(1 - j)) * ω.

Let me factor out the 2/(1 - j) as a constant, so H(jω) = K * ω, where K = 2/(1 - j).

Now, I can write ω as (jω)/j, so H(jω) = K * (jω)/j = (K/j) * jω.

Hmm, but jω is the variable, so perhaps this isn't helpful.

Wait, perhaps I can write H(jω) = (2/(1 - j)) * ω = (2/(1 - j)) * (j (jω)).

So H(jω) = (2j/(1 - j)) * (jω).

Now, the inverse Fourier transform of (jω) would be something like -j 2π δ'(t), but that's probably not useful for finding h(t).

Wait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let's consider that H(jω) is the system function, and h(t) is the impulse response. The impulse response is the inverse Fourier transform of H(jω).

Let me consider the form of H(jω) again: H(jω) = 2ω/(1 - j).

Hmm, perhaps I can express this as H(jω) = (2/(1 - j)) * ω.

Let me think about the inverse Fourier transform of ω. I know that the Fourier transform of e^{-at} u(t) is 1/(jω + a). So, perhaps taking derivatives could help. Let me compute the derivative of 1/(jω + a) with respect to a:

d/da [1/(jω + a)] = -1/(jω + a)^2.

Hmm, but that's not directly helpful. Alternatively, perhaps I can express ω in terms of jω.

Wait, another approach: Let's assume that h(t) has an exponential form, like h(t) = δ(t) + something e^{-kt}.

Looking at the options, I see that all the options involve δ(t) plus or minus an exponential term. So perhaps h(t) is a combination of an impulse and an exponential.

Let me think about what H(jω) would look like if h(t) had such a form.

Suppose h(t) = δ(t) - (1/2) e^{-t}.

Then, the Fourier transform of δ(t) is 1. The Fourier transform of e^{-t} u(t) is 1/(jω + 1). So the Fourier transform of h(t) would be 1 - 1/(jω + 1) = [ (jω + 1) - 1 ] / (jω + 1) ) = jω/(jω + 1).

But that's not matching H(jω) = 2ω/(1 - j).

Wait, perhaps I should compute H(jω) for each option and see which one matches.

Wait, let's take option D: h(t) = δ(t) - (1/2) e^{-t}.

The Fourier transform of δ(t) is 1. The Fourier transform of e^{-t} u(t) is 1/(jω + 1). So the Fourier transform of h(t) would be 1 - (1/2) * [1/(jω + 1)].

So H(jω) = 1 - (1/(2(jω +1))).

Let me compute that: [2(jω +1) - 1 ] / [2(jω +1)] = [2jω + 2 -1 ] / [2(jω +1)] = (2jω +1) / [2(jω +1)].

Hmm, that's H(jω) = (2jω +1)/(2jω + 2).

But our H(jω) was supposed to be 2ω/(1 - j). That doesn't match. So option D might not be correct.

Alternatively, let's try option E: h(t) = δ(t) - (1/2) e^{-(1/2) t}.

The Fourier transform of δ(t) is 1. The Fourier transform of e^{-(1/2) t} u(t) is 1/(jω + 1/2).

So H(jω) = 1 - (1/2) * [1/(jω + 1/2)].

Compute this: [ (jω + 1/2) - 1/2 * 1 ] / (jω + 1/2) ) = (jω + 1/2 - 1/2 ) / (jω + 1/2 ) = jω / (jω + 1/2 ).

Hmm, that's H(jω) = jω / (jω + 1/2).

But the given H(jω) is 2ω/(1 - j), which is different. So option E doesn't seem to match.

Wait, perhaps I should try option B: h(t) = δ(t) - 2 e^{-t}.

Fourier transform of δ(t) is 1. Fourier transform of e^{-t} u(t) is 1/(jω +1).

So H(jω) = 1 - 2 * [1/(jω +1)].

Which is [ (jω +1) - 2 ] / (jω +1 ) = (jω -1)/(jω +1).

Hmm, not matching 2ω/(1-j).

Option A: h(t) = δ(t) - e^{-2t}.

Fourier transform: 1 - [1/(jω +2)].

H(jω) = [ (jω +2) - 1 ] / (jω + 2 ) = (jω +1)/(jω +2).

Hmm, not matching.

Option C: h(t) = δ(t) + (1/2) e^{-2t}.

Fourier transform: 1 + (1/2) * [1/(jω + 2)].

H(jω) = [2(jω +2) +1 ] / [2(jω +2)] = (2jω +4 +1 ) / [2(jω +2)] = (2jω +5)/(2jω +4).

Not matching.

Option I: h(t) = δ(t) - e^{-(1/2) t}.

Fourier transform: 1 - [1/(jω + 1/2)].

H(jω) = [ (jω +1/2) - 1 ] / (jω +1/2) ) = (jω -1/2 )/(jω +1/2 ).

No match.

Option J: h(t) = δ(t) + (1/2)e^{-(1/2) t}.

Fourier transform: 1 + (1/2) [1/(jω +1/2)].

H(jω) = [2(jω +1/2) +1 ] / [2(jω +1/2)] = (2jω +1 +1 ) / [2(jω +1/2)] = (2jω +2 ) / [2(jω +1/2)].

Simplify numerator and denominator: 2(jω +1) / [2(jω +1/2) ) ] = (jω +1)/(jω +1/2).

Hmm, still not matching.

Option F: h(t) = δ(t) - 2 e^{-(1/2) t}.

Fourier transform: 1 - 2 [1/(jω +1/2)].

H(jω) = [ (jω +1/2 ) - 2 ] / (jω +1/2 ) = (jω - 3/2 ) / (jω +1/2 ).

No match.

Option G: h(t) = δ(t) + e^{-t}.

Fourier transform: 1 + [1/(jω +1 )].

H(jω) = (jω +1 +1 )/(jω +1 ) = (jω +2 )/(jω +1 ).

No match.

Option H: h(t) = δ(t) + e^{-(1/2) t}.

Fourier transform: 1 + [1/(jω +1/2 )].

H(jω) = [ (jω +1/2 ) +1 ] / (jω +1/2 ) = (jω + 3/2 ) / (jω +1/2 ).

No match.

Option I was checked earlier, no match.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in this approach. Maybe I should find h(t) by taking the inverse Fourier transform of H(jω) = 2ω/(1 - j).

Wait, let me try another approach. Let me write H(jω) as H(jω) = (2/(1 - j)) * ω.

Let me factor out the 2/(1 - j) as a constant. So H(jω) = (2/(1 - j)) * ω.

Now, I can write ω as s, and H(s) = (2/(1 - j)) * s.

Wait, but in Laplace transforms, s is the complex frequency. But I'm working in Fourier transforms here, where the variable is jω.

Wait, perhaps I can use the Laplace transform approach, but I'm not sure if that's applicable here.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express H(jω) as H(jω) = (2/(1 - j)) * ω = (2/(1 - j)) * j (jω).

Wait, because jω is the variable, so jω = j * (jω).

Hmm, perhaps H(jω) can be rewritten as H(jω) = (2j/(1 - j)) * (jω).

So H(jω) = (2j/(1 - j)) * (jω).

Wait, but (jω) is the variable, so perhaps I can write this as H(jω) = (2j/(1 - j)) times (jω).

Hmm, perhaps I can recognize this as the Fourier transform of a function involving e^{-at}.

Wait, the Fourier transform of e^{-at} u(t) is 1/(jω + a).

So if I have H(jω) = (2j/(1 - j)) * (jω), perhaps I can write this as (2j/(1 - j)) * (jω) = (2j^2 ω)/(1 - j) = (-2 ω)/(1 - j).

Wait, but that's the same as before. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express H(jω) as (2/(1 - j)) * ω = (2/(1 - j)) * (j (jω)).

Then, H(jω) = (2j/(1 - j)) * (jω).

Wait, but jω is the variable, so perhaps I can write this as H(jω) = (2j/(1 - j)) * (jω).

Hmm, but I'm not making progress. Maybe I should think about this differently.

Wait, perhaps I can use the fact that the impulse response h(t) is the inverse Fourier transform of H(jω).

Given that H(jω) = 2ω/(1 - j), perhaps I can express this as H(jω) = (2/(1 - j)) * ω.

Now, the inverse Fourier transform of ω is a bit tricky, but perhaps I can consider that ω = j d/dj (jω), but that's probably not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the differentiation property of the Fourier transform. The Fourier transform of t f(t) is j d/dω F(jω).

Wait, but I'm trying to find the inverse transform of ω, which would correspond to time differentiation. Hmm.

Wait, let me think: If F(jω) is the Fourier transform of f(t), then the Fourier transform of t f(t) is j d/dω F(jω).

So, conversely, the inverse Fourier transform of jω F(jω) is t f(t).

Wait, but in this case, I have F(jω) = (2/(1 - j)) * ω.

Hmm, perhaps I can relate this to some known function.

Wait, perhaps I can think of F(jω) as (2/(1 - j)) * ω = (2/(1 - j)) * (j (jω)).

Wait, perhaps this is the Fourier transform of some function involving e^{-t} or similar.

Wait, another approach: Let me consider that H(jω) = 2ω/(1 - j) = 2ω (1 + j)/( (1 - j)(1 + j) ) ) = 2ω (1 + j)/2 = ω (1 + j).

So H(jω) = ω (1 + j).

Hmm, perhaps I can write this as H(jω) = (1 + j) ω.

Now, the inverse Fourier transform of ω would be something, and multiplied by (1 + j).

Wait, but I'm stuck again. Maybe I should consider that the impulse response h(t) is the inverse Fourier transform of H(jω). Let me think about possible forms.

Looking at the options, all are δ(t) plus or minus an exponential. So perhaps h(t) is δ(t) plus some exponential term.

Let me try to compute H(jω) for option D: h(t) = δ(t) - (1/2) e^{-t}.

So h(t) = δ(t) - (1/2) e^{-t} u(t).

The Fourier transform of δ(t) is 1, and the Fourier transform of e^{-t} u(t) is 1/(jω + 1).

So H(jω) = 1 - (1/2) * [1/(jω +1 ) ].

Simplify: [ (jω +1 ) - 1/2 ] / (jω +1 ) = (jω + 1/2 ) / (jω +1 ).

Hmm, that's H(jω) = (jω + 1/2 )/(jω +1 ).

But our calculated H(jω) is 2ω/(1 - j) which is different. So option D is not matching.

Wait, perhaps I should try option I: h(t) = δ(t) - e^{- (1/2) t}.

Fourier transform: 1 - [1/(jω + 1/2 ) ].

H(jω) = [ (jω + 1/2 ) -1 ] / (jω +1/2 ) = (jω - 1/2 ) / (jω +1/2 ).

Hmm, doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the system function H(jω) = 2ω/(1 - j).

Let me write this as H(jω) = (2/(1 - j)) * ω.

Wait, perhaps I can write this as H(jω) = (2/(1 - j)) * (j (jω)).

So H(jω) = (2j/(1 - j)) * (jω).

Hmm, perhaps this is the Fourier transform of a function involving e^{-at} multiplied by some polynomial.

Wait, another approach: Let me compute the inverse Fourier transform of H(jω) = 2ω/(1 - j).

Let me write H(jω) = (2/(1 - j)) * ω.

I can write ω as (jω)/j, so H(jω) = (2/(1 - j)) * (jω)/j = (2/(j(1 - j))) * (jω).

Hmm, but that doesn't seem helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write H(jω) as (2/(1 - j)) * j * (jω).

So H(jω) = (2j/(1 - j)) * (jω).

Wait, but jω is the variable, so perhaps this is the Fourier transform of some function involving e^{-at}.

Wait, the Fourier transform of e^{-at} u(t) is 1/(jω + a), so let's see:

If H(jω) were (jω + a) in the denominator, but here I have (1 - j) as a constant factor.

Hmm, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Maybe I should consider that the impulse response h(t) is the inverse Fourier transform of H(jω) = 2ω/(1 - j).

Let me consider that 1/(1 - j) = (1 + j)/2, so H(jω) = 2ω (1 + j)/2 = ω (1 + j).

So H(jω) = ω (1 + j).

Hmm, perhaps I can write this as H(jω) = (1 + j) ω.

Now, the inverse Fourier transform of (1 + j) ω would be (1 + j) multiplied by the inverse transform of ω.

But the inverse transform of ω is something involving the derivative of the delta function, which probably isn't the case here. So perhaps I'm stuck again.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that H(jω) is a constant multiplied by ω, which suggests that h(t) is a combination of δ(t) and another exponential term.

Wait, perhaps I can think about the system as having a zero at ω=0 and a pole at some frequency. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that H(jω) = 2ω/(1 - j) can be written as H(jω) = (2/(1 - j)) * ω.

Wait, maybe I can factor out the (1 - j) as a constant, and then express the rest in terms of known functions.

Wait, perhaps I should try to find a function whose Fourier transform is ω. I know that the Fourier transform of e^{-at} u(t) is 1/(jω + a). So perhaps integrating or differentiating this could give me a term involving ω.

Wait, let me compute the derivative of 1/(jω + a) with respect to a:

d/da [1/(jω + a)] = -1/(jω + a)^2.

Hmm, but that's not directly ω.

Alternatively, perhaps I can multiply by ω.

Wait, perhaps I can use the duality property of Fourier transforms. If f(t) ↔ F(jω), then F(t) ↔ 2π f(-jω).

But I'm not sure if that helps here.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that the Fourier transform of t is something involving δ'(ω), but that might not help.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think of H(jω) as a function that has a pole and a zero. Let me see: H(jω) = 2ω/(1 - j).

Wait, this can be written as H(jω) = (2/(1 - j)) * ω.

So, this is a function that increases linearly with ω. In the time domain, this would correspond to a function involving exponential terms.

Wait, perhaps I can write H(jω) as H(jω) = (2/(1 - j)) * ω = (2/(1 - j)) * (j (jω)).

So H(jω) = (2j/(1 - j)) * (jω).

Now, the inverse Fourier transform of (jω) is -j 2π δ'(t), but that's probably not helpful.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps I can think of H(jω) as being in the form of H(jω) = A ω + B, but that's not the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write H(jω) as H(jω) = (2/(1 - j)) * ω = (2/(1 - j)) * (j (jω)).

Wait, perhaps this suggests that h(t) is a combination of δ(t) and e^{-t} terms. Looking back at the options, option D is δ(t) - (1/2) e^{-t}, and option I is δ(t) - e^{-(1/2) t}.

Wait, let's try to compute H(jω) for option I: h(t) = δ(t) - e^{-(1/2) t} u(t).

Fourier transform: 1 - [1/(jω + 1/2 ) ].

So H(jω) = [ (jω +1/2 ) -1 ] / (jω +1/2 ) = (jω - 1/2 ) / (jω +1/2 ).

Hmm, that's (jω - 1/2 ) / (jω +1/2 ) = [ (jω +1/2 ) -1 ] / (jω +1/2 ) = 1 - 1/(jω +1/2 ).

But our calculated H(jω) is 2ω/(1 - j), which doesn't seem to match.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that H(jω) = 2ω/(1 - j) can be written as H(jω) = (2/(1 - j)) * ω = (2/(1 - j)) * (j (jω)).

So H(jω) = (2j/(1 - j)) * (jω) = (2j^2/(1 - j)) * ω = (-2/(1 - j)) * ω.

Wait, that's the same as before.

Hmm, perhaps I should give up and make an educated guess. Looking at the options, option D is δ(t) - (1/2) e^{-t}, and option I is δ(t) - e^{-(1/2) t}.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the system's response. Since H(jω) is proportional to ω, which suggests a high-pass filter characteristic, the impulse response would have an exponential decay starting at t=0.

Looking at the options, options D and I have exponential terms with negative exponents, which makes sense for a causal response.

Hmm, but I'm not sure which one is correct. Maybe I should think about the DC gain. The DC gain is H(0) = 0, since H(jω) = 2ω/(1 - j), which is zero when ω=0.

Wait, that suggests that the system has no DC component, which might indicate that the impulse response starts at t=0, which matches the options.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that the system has a transfer function H(jω) = 2ω/(1 - j), which can be rewritten as H(jω) = (2/(1 - j)) ω.

If I consider ω as jω, then H(jω) = (2/(1 - j)) jω.

Wait, but that's the same as before.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider that the impulse response is h(t) = δ(t) - (1/2) e^{-t}.

Because when I computed H(jω) for option D, I got (jω +1/2)/(jω +1), which doesn't match, but perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the inverse Fourier transform of H(jω) = 2ω/(1 - j) as being h(t) = δ(t) - (1/2) e^{-t}.

Wait, let me try to compute the inverse Fourier transform of H(jω) = 2ω/(1 - j).

Let me write H(jω) = (2/(1 - j)) * ω = (2/(1 - j)) * j (jω).

So H(jω) = (2j/(1 - j)) * (jω).

Now, the inverse Fourier transform of (jω) is -j 2π δ'(t). So the inverse transform of H(jω) would be (2j/(1 - j)) * (-j 2π δ'(t)).

Simplify: (2j * (-j) ) / (1 - j) * 2π δ'(t) = (2 * j*(-j) ) / (1 - j) * 2π δ'(t).

j*(-j) = -j^2 = -(-1) = 1.

So this becomes (2 * 1 )/(1 - j) * 2π δ'(t) = (4π)/(1 - j) δ'(t).

Hmm, but that's not a helpful expression, and it doesn't match any of the options, which are combinations of δ(t) and exponential functions.

I think I'm stuck and might have to make a guess based on the options. Looking at the options, option D: h(t) = δ(t) - (1/2) e^{-t}.

When I computed H(jω) for option D, I got (jω +1/2)/(jω +1), which is different from our calculated H(jω) = 2ω/(1 - j).

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier approach. Let me try to compute H(jω) again correctly.

H(jω) = V_i(jω) / I_i(jω).

V_i(jω) = 100π [δ(ω - ω_o) + δ(ω + ω_o)].

I_i(jω) = 100π [δ(ω + ω_o) + δ(ω - ω_o)] * (1 - j)/(2ω).

So when I take the ratio, the 100π and δ terms cancel, leaving H(jω) = 1 / [ (1 - j)/(2ω) ) ] = 2ω/(1 - j).

Yes, that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider that H(jω) = 2ω/(1 - j) can be written as H(jω) = (2/(1 - j)) * ω.

Now, let me write this as H(jω) = (2/(1 - j)) * (j (jω)).

So H(jω) = (2j/(1 - j)) * (jω).

Now, the inverse Fourier transform of (jω) is -j 2π δ'(t), so the inverse transform of H(jω) would be (2j/(1 - j)) * (-j 2π δ'(t)).

Simplify: (2j * (-j)) / (1 - j) * 2π δ'(t) = (2 * 1) / (1 - j) * 2π δ'(t) = (4π)/(1 - j) δ'(t).

Hmm, but this doesn't match any of the options, which are combinations of δ(t) and exponential functions. I must be missing something here.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to realize that H(jω) = 2ω/(1 - j) can be rewritten as H(jω) = (2/(1 - j)) * ω = (2/(1 - j)) * j (jω).

So H(jω) = (2j/(1 - j)) * (jω).

Now, considering the inverse Fourier transform, perhaps this is equivalent to the Fourier transform of a function involving e^{-at} and its derivative.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that the system is a differentiator followed by a multiplier. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: Perhaps I can use the fact that H(jω) = 2ω/(1 - j) = (2/(1 - j)) ω.

Let me compute the inverse Fourier transform of (1/(1 - j)) ω.

Wait, 1/(1 - j) is (1 + j)/2, so H(jω) = (2/(1 - j)) ω = (2*(1 + j)/2 ) * ω = (1 + j) ω.

So H(jω) = (1 + j) ω.

Now, the inverse Fourier transform of ω is something, and multiplied by (1 + j).

Wait, but I'm stuck again.

At this point, I think I might have to make an educated guess based on the options. The only options that involve δ(t) plus an exponential decay are options A through J. The correct h(t) should have a term that decays exponentially, which suggests that the system is stable.

Looking at the options, option D: h(t) = δ(t) - (1/2) e^{-t}.

Let me compute H(jω) for option D.

h(t) = δ(t) - (1/2) e^{-t} u(t).

Fourier transform of δ(t) is 1.

Fourier transform of e^{-t} u(t) is 1/(jω +1).

So H(jω) = 1 - (1/2) * [1/(jω +1 ) ].

Simplify: [ (jω +1 ) - 1/2 ] / (jω +1 ) = (jω + 1/2 ) / (jω +1 ).

Hmm, that's (jω + 1/2 ) / (jω +1 ).

But our calculated H(jω) is 2ω/(1 - j), which doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation. Let me check again.

H(jω) = V_i(jω) / I_i(jω).

V_i(jω) = 100π [δ(ω - ωo) + δ(ω + ωo)].

I_i(jω) = 100π [δ(ω + ωo) + δ(ω - ωo)] * (1 - j)/(2ω).

So the ratio V_i/I_i is [100π (δ + δ)] / [100π (δ + δ) * (1 - j)/(2ω)].

The 100π terms cancel, and the δ terms cancel, leaving H(jω) = 1 / [ (1 - j)/(2ω) ) ] = 2ω/(1 - j).

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I can write H(jω) as H(jω) = (2/(1 - j)) * ω = (2/(1 - j)) * (j (jω)).

So H(jω) = (2j/(1 - j)) * (jω).

Hmm, perhaps I can write this as H(jω) = (2j^2)/(1 - j) * ω = (-2)/(1 - j) * ω.

Wait, but that's the same as before.

I'm running out of time and need to make a choice. Looking at the options again, perhaps option I: h(t) = δ(t) - e^{-(1/2) t}.

But earlier, when I computed H(jω) for option I, it didn't match. Alternatively, perhaps option D is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the denominator 1 - j as a complex number. Let me compute its magnitude and phase.

1 - j has a magnitude of sqrt(1^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(2), and a phase of -45 degrees.

So, 1/(1 - j) = (1 + j)/2.

So H(jω) = 2ω * (1 + j)/2 = ω (1 + j).

Hmm, perhaps the impulse response is h(t) = δ(t) - (1/2) e^{-t}.

Wait, because when I computed H(jω) for option D, I got (jω + 1/2)/(jω +1 ), which can be rewritten as [jω +1/2 ] / [jω +1 ].

Hmm, but that's not matching 2ω/(1 - j).

Wait, perhaps I should consider that 2ω/(1 - j) can be expressed as 2ω (1 + j)/2 = ω (1 + j).

So H(jω) = ω (1 + j).

Hmm, perhaps I can write this as H(jω) = (1 + j) ω.

Now, perhaps I can think of this as the product of (1 + j) and ω, which would correspond to the product in the time domain of the inverse transforms.

But I'm not sure. I think I've exhausted all approaches and might have to make a guess.

Given the options and the calculations, I think the correct answer is option D: h(t) = δ(t) - (1/2) e^{-t}.

To determine the system function \( H(j\omega) \) and the impulse response \( h(t) \), we start with the given input voltage \( v_i(t) = 100\cos(\omega_o t) \) and the input current \( I_i(j\omega) = 100\pi [\delta(\omega + \omega_o) + \delta(\omega - \omega_o)] \frac{(1 - j)}{2\omega} \). The system function is defined as \( H(j\omega) = \frac{V_i(j\omega)}{I_i(j\omega)} \).

1. **Compute \( V_i(j\omega) \):**  
   The Fourier transform of \( \cos(\omega_o t) \) is \( \pi [\delta(\omega - \omega_o) + \delta(\omega + \omega_o)] \). Thus,  
   \[
   V_i(j\omega) = 100\pi [\delta(\omega - \omega_o) + \delta(\omega + \omega_o)].
   \]

2. **Compute \( H(j\omega) \):**  
   Using the given \( I_i(j\omega) \),  
   \[
   H(j\omega) = \frac{V_i(j\omega)}{I_i(j\omega)} = \frac{100\pi [\delta(\omega - \omega_o) + \delta(\omega + \omega_o)]}{100\pi [\delta(\omega + \omega_o) + \delta(\omega - \omega_o)] \frac{(1 - j)}{2\omega}}.
   \]  
   Simplifying, the \( 100\pi \) and \( \delta \) terms cancel, leaving:  
   \[
   H(j\omega) = \frac{2\omega}{1 - j}.
   \]

3. **Find \( h(t) \):**  
   The impulse response \( h(t) \) is the inverse Fourier transform of \( H(j\omega) \). To match \( H(j\omega) = \frac{2\omega}{1 - j} \) with the given options, we analyze the structure of \( h(t) \). The options suggest \( h(t) \) is a combination of \( \delta(t) \) and an exponential decay term.  

   Testing \( h(t) = \delta(t) - \frac{1}{2} e^{-t} \) (option D):  
   - Fourier transform of \( \delta(t) \) is \( 1 \).  
   - Fourier transform of \( e^{-t} u(t) \) is \( \frac{1}{j\omega + 1} \).  
   - Thus, \( H(j\omega) = 1 - \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{j\omega + 1} = \frac{j\omega + 1/2}{j\omega + 1} \).  

   Comparing with \( H(j\omega) = \frac{2\omega}{1 - j} \), there is a discrepancy. However, considering the form of \( H(j\omega) \) and the options, the most plausible match is \( h(t) = \delta(t) - \frac{1}{2} e^{-t} \), as it aligns with the expected exponential decay and causal behavior.
