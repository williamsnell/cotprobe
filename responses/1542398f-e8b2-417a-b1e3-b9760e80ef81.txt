Question:

A man needed to have the oil changed on his car. On Friday, he decided to take his car to the local dealership to have the oil changed and asked his neighbor if she would give him a ride home from the dealership. The neighbor said, "Why pay the high prices a dealership will charge you? I can change the oil in your car for you. If you will agree to pay me $50, I'll change the oil in your car over the weekend. " The man readily agreed. On Sunday afternoon, the man noticed that his neighbor still had not started working on the car. He asked his neighbor if the car would be ready for him to drive to work Monday morning. The neighbor replied, "I thought about it and realized $50 is too low a price for the work involved. I don't think I'm going to change the oil in your car. " The man then said, "Look, I realize $50 is low for the work involved. If you can change the oil in my car by tomorrow morning, I'll pay you an additional $25. And I won't sue you in small claims court for your failure to perform your promise. " The neighbor then changed the oil late Sunday afternoon, but the man refused to pay to the neighbor anything more than $50. In a suit by the neighbor to recover the additional $25 promised by the man, the neighbor will

Options:

A: lose, because the neighbor had a pre-existing duty to change the oil in the car for $50.
B: win, because the second contract for $75 superseded the original $50 contract.
C: win, because the man willingly offered an additional $25 for the service.
D: win, because the man breached the verbal contract they had.
E: win, because she performed her part of the bargain.
F: win, because the man promised not to sue in small claims court.
G: lose, because the neighbor did not fulfill the initial agreement within the agreed timeframe.
H: lose, because the man's offer of an additional $25 was not legally binding.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this legal question about contracts. Let me read through the scenario again and break it down step by step.

So, a man needs his car's oil changed. On Friday, he asks his neighbor for a ride home from the dealership, and the neighbor offers to change the oil instead. The neighbor says she'll do it for $50, and the man agrees. That seems like a contract: offer, acceptance, consideration. So the initial agreement is for $50, and the neighbor is supposed to change the oil.

Then, on Sunday afternoon, the man checks in and asks if the car will be ready by Monday. The neighbor says she changed her mind because $50 is too low, so she's not going to do it. That's a problem because she's backing out of the original contract. But the man offers more money—$25 extra, making it $75 total—if she does it by tomorrow morning. He also says he won't sue her for not performing the original promise. So now, the neighbor agrees and does the oil change late Sunday afternoon.

Now, the man only pays her the original $50, and she's suing for the extra $25. The question is whether she'll win that lawsuit.

I remember that contract law requires offer, acceptance, and consideration. Also, consideration must be something of value exchanged. So, in the first contract, the neighbor agreed to change the oil for $50. That's a valid contract.

When the man offered an additional $25, that's a new offer. But for a contract to be formed, there must be consideration from both sides. The man is offering more money, but does that count as consideration from his side? Also, the neighbor had already agreed to the original $50, so her promise was already in place.

Wait, but in the second agreement, the man is promising more money in exchange for her performance. But she was already under the original contract to perform for $50. So, is the second agreement a valid modification? Or is it a new contract?

I think that if both parties agree to modify an existing contract, that's generally allowed. But here, the man is offering more money, but the neighbor is just agreeing to do the same thing for more money. So, the modification would require new consideration. But under the pre-existing duty rule, a promise to do something you're already obligated to do isn't valid consideration.

So, in the original contract, the neighbor was already bound to change the oil for $50. The man's offer of an additional $25 is asking her to do the same thing she was already contractually obligated to do. Therefore, there's no new consideration for the second agreement. Without consideration, the second contract might not be enforceable.

Additionally, the man said he wouldn't sue her for breaching the original contract. That might be a waiver, but I'm not sure how that affects the second agreement. But the main issue is whether there was consideration for the additional $25.

So, if there's no consideration, then the second contract isn't enforceable. That would mean the neighbor can't collect the extra $25 because the second agreement lacked consideration. Therefore, in the lawsuit, the neighbor would lose because the additional promise wasn't supported by consideration.

Looking at the options:

A: Lose because neighbor had a pre-existing duty. That sounds right based on what I thought—she was already obligated under the first contract.

B: Win because the second contract superseded the first. But without consideration, the second contract isn't valid, so this is incorrect.

C: Win because man offered more money. But without consideration, her performance doesn't bind her to the new terms.

D: Win because man breached the first contract. No, the man didn't breach; the neighbor refused to perform first, then he offered more money.

E: Win because she performed. She did perform, but if the contract is unenforceable due to lack of consideration, she doesn't win the extra.

F: Win because man promised not to sue. That's a separate issue, but the main problem is the consideration.

G: Lose because she didn't fulfill the initial agreement on time. But she did fulfill it eventually, just late. The question is about the second payment, not the timing.

H: Lose because the offer wasn't binding. That's possible, but I think it's more about consideration.

So, the best answer is A: lose because she had a pre-existing duty.
</think>

The scenario involves a contract dispute where the neighbor initially agreed to change the car's oil for $50 but later demanded an additional $25. The key issue is whether the second agreement is enforceable. Under the pre-existing duty rule, a promise to perform an obligation already owed is not valid consideration. Since the neighbor was already contractually bound to perform for $50, the additional $25 offer lacks consideration, making the second agreement unenforceable. Therefore, the neighbor cannot recover the extra $25.
