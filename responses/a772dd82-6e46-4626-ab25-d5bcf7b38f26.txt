Okay, so I have this question about how many chickens were killed for meat production in 2018, and I need to choose the correct answer from options A to J. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that the global meat industry is a huge business, and chicken is one of the most consumed meats. I think the numbers are in the billions, so I can probably eliminate some options right away. Let's look at the options:

A: 690 billion
B: 1 trillion
C: 2.5 billion
D: 690 million
E: 250 billion
F: 120 billion
G: 69 billion
H: 6.9 billion
I: 12 billion
J: 25 billion

Hmm, okay. I know that 1 trillion is 1,000 billion, which seems really high. I'm not sure if the world produces that many chickens annually. Maybe 690 billion (A) is possible, but I'm not certain. Let me think about what I know about chicken production.

I recall that in recent years, the number has been increasing because of the growing population and higher demand for meat, especially in developing countries. I think the numbers are in the hundreds of billions. So options C, D, G, H, I, and J are probably too low. That leaves A, B, E, F.

Wait, I think the global chicken production is around 60 billion to 100 billion annually. Let me see. I remember reading that in 2018, the number was around 69 billion. So looking at the options, G is 69 billion. But wait, option A is 690 billion, which is ten times higher. Did I mix up the numbers?

Wait, maybe I'm confusing the total number of chickens raised versus those killed. Or perhaps the units are different. Let me double-check my memory. I think the correct figure is around 69 billion chickens per year. So that would be option G: 69 billion.

Wait, but I'm not 100% sure. Another thought: maybe it's 69 billion, or perhaps it's higher. I think the number has been increasing, so maybe it's higher than that. Let me think about where I might have heard this number.

I recall that in 2018, the estimated number was around 69 billion chickens used for meat. So that would point to option G. But wait, another source I remember said around 70 billion, so G is 69, which is close. Alternatively, maybe it's 690 million, but that's way too low because 690 million is 0.69 billion, which doesn't make sense for global production.

Wait, another angle: the total number of chickens in the world is estimated to be around 24 billion, but that's for all purposes, including eggs. But for meat production specifically, it's higher. So 69 billion seems plausible.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes numbers are presented in different units. Let me think again. If the answer is 69 billion, that's 69,000 million. So option G is 69 billion. Alternatively, if it's 690 million, that's 0.69 billion, which is way too low.

Wait, I think I've read that the global poultry meat production is around 69 billion birds annually. So that would make G the correct answer. But wait, another thought: maybe the number is higher. Let me check my reasoning again.

I think the correct figure is around 69 billion chickens killed for meat in 2018. So the answer should be G: 69 billion.

The correct answer is G: 69 billion. 

Answer: G
