Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the Internal-External Control Scale. The question is asking about the sex and race differences that have been found on this scale. I'm a bit rusty on my psychology, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that the Internal-External Control Scale, sometimes referred to as locus of control, measures how much people believe they can control their own lives versus how much they think their environment or others control them. People with an internal locus of control believe their actions are primarily responsible for their outcomes, while those with an external locus think outside factors are more influential.

Now, considering sex differences: I think there's some research suggesting that women tend to have a more internal locus of control compared to men. Or wait, was it the other way around? Hmm. Wait, no, I think women are generally more internal. They might be more likely to attribute success or failure to their own efforts, whereas men might lean more towards external factors. Or maybe it's the opposite. I'm not entirely sure. I should double-check my memory. From what I recall, some studies show that women are more internal, but I'm not 100% confident.

Now, race differences. I'm a bit less sure about this. I think that cultural factors might influence locus of control. For example, some research might suggest that certain ethnic groups have higher internal control. Wait, I think African Americans might have a higher internal locus compared to whites, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, it could be the opposite. Or perhaps there's no significant difference. I'm getting a bit confused here.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Women are more internal than men, no difference between blacks and whites. So women internal, blacks and whites same.

Option B: No differences at all. I don't think that's correct because I remember some sex differences, though maybe not race.

Option C: Women more external, blacks more external than whites. That seems opposite to what I thought about women.

Option D: Women more internal, blacks more internal than whites. This aligns with my initial thought about women being internal and perhaps blacks being more so.

Option E: No sex difference, blacks more external. So women and men same, blacks external. Not sure, but I don't think there's no sex difference.

Option F: Women internal, whites internal than blacks. So women more internal, and whites more than blacks. So blacks would be more external. I'm not sure about the race part here.

Option G: Equal in internal, whites more internal than blacks. So no sex difference, which I don't think is right.

Option H: Men more external, whites more external. So men external, whites external. I'm not sure about either.

Option I: Men more internal, blacks more internal. So the opposite of what I thought about men. Wait, no, I thought women were more internal. So this would say men are more internal than women, which contradicts my initial thought.

Option J: Equal external, blacks more internal. So men and women equally external, blacks more internal. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the typical findings. I think that women generally have a more internal locus of control compared to men. So options where women are internal would be D, F, or others. For race, I'm less certain. Some studies might suggest that African Americans have a more internal locus, possibly due to cultural emphasis on self-determination or historical experiences. So in that case, blacks would be more internal than whites.

So looking at the options:

Option D says women are more internal and blacks are more internal. That would fit if both are true. Option F says women are internal and whites are more internal than blacks. So if blacks are more internal, F is wrong. Option D would be correct in that case.

But wait, I'm not 100% sure about the race part. Another angle: the Internal-External Control Scale was developed by Julian B. Rotter. I think his work suggests that locus of control can vary by culture. For example, some collectivist cultures might have a more internal locus because they focus on personal responsibility. African American culture, being collectivist in some aspects, might have a higher internal locus. Alternatively, maybe it's the other way around due to systemic factors, but I'm not certain.

So, if both sex and race differences exist, and women and blacks are more internal, then Option D would be correct. Alternatively, if only sex differences exist, then perhaps a different option.

Wait, the question is about what has been found, so I need to think about the correct answer based on existing research. From what I remember, women do tend to score higher on internal control than men. For race, I'm less sure, but I think that some studies show that African Americans have a higher internal locus of control compared to whites, possibly due to cultural or historical reasons. If that's the case, then D would be correct.

Alternatively, another possibility is that whites have a more internal locus, but I'm not as confident about that. Maybe it's the other way around. I'm a bit stuck on the race part, but leaning towards D as the correct answer.

The Internal-External Control Scale measures an individual's belief in their ability to control their life outcomes. Research indicates that women generally exhibit a more internal locus of control compared to men, meaning they attribute their successes and failures to their own actions. Regarding race differences, some studies suggest that African Americans may have a higher internal locus of control than whites, possibly due to cultural or historical factors emphasizing self-determination. Based on these findings, the correct answer is:

D: Women are more internal than men and blacks are more internal than whites.

Answer: D
