Question:

This question refers to the following information.
"When we were kids the United States was the wealthiest and strongest country in the world; the only one with the atom bomb, the least scarred by modern war, an initiator of the United Nations that we thought would distribute Western influence throughout the world. Freedom and equality for each individual, government of, by, and for the people—these American values we found good, principles by which we could live as men. Many of us began maturing in complacency.
"As we grew, however, our comfort was penetrated by events too troubling to dismiss. First, the permeating and victimizing fact of human degradation, symbolized by the Southern struggle against racial bigotry, compelled most of us from silence to activism. Second, the enclosing fact of the Cold War, symbolized by the presence of the Bomb, brought awareness that we ourselves, and our friends, and millions of abstract 'others' we knew more directly because of our common peril, might die at any time. . . ."

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about the Port Huron Statement and the growth of the organization that published it during the remainder of the 1960s. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that the Port Huron Statement was a significant document from the 1960s. It was written by the Students for a Democratic Society (SDS), right? So the question is about what context best explains the growth of SDS in the 1960s after the statement was published in 1962.

Looking at the passage, it mentions that when they were kids, the US was seen as the wealthiest and strongest country, with the atom bomb, and they felt a sense of complacency. But as they grew, two main issues troubled them: human degradation, symbolized by the Southern struggle against racial bigotry, and the Cold War, symbolized by the presence of the Bomb. These events made them move from silence to activism.

So the context for SDS's growth would involve these issues. Let's look at the options.

Option A: Increase in immigration, labor unions, feminist movement. Hmm, these were important in the 60s, but the passage specifically mentions racial issues and the Cold War. So maybe not the best fit.

Option B: Baby boom, economic growth, higher education expansion. These factors might have contributed to a larger student population, but the passage is more about the issues driving activism, not just growth factors.

Option C: Computers, Christian fundamentalism, student apathy. Doesn't seem to align with the passage's focus on racial issues and the Cold War.

Option D: Escalation of Vietnam War, peace movement, assassinations. The Vietnam War was a big deal in the mid-60s, and the peace movement ties in with both the Cold War fears and racial activism. Assassinations of key figures like MLK and Kennedy likely galvanized movements.

Option E: Economic polarization, supply-side policies, middle class disappearing. Not directly tied to the issues in the passage.

Option F: Decline of colonial powers, spread of democracy. More related to global politics but not specifically the US context of racial struggles and Cold War.

Option G: Technologies, internet, multinationals. The internet wasn't a big thing in the 60s, so probably not.

Option H: Civil rights movement, spread of communism, nuclear threat. This seems relevant because the passage mentions the Southern struggle (civil rights) and the Cold War (nuclear threat). The spread of communism ties into the Cold War context.

Option I: End of Cold War, dissolution of Soviet Union, globalization. These events happened later, in the 80s and 90s, so probably not the context for the 60s.

Option J: Industrialization, urban growth, corporate consolidation. More about economic and urban changes, not directly the issues mentioned.

So between D and H. The passage talks about the Cold War (nuclear threat) and racial bigotry (civil rights). H includes the civil rights movement, spread of communism (which relates to Cold War), and nuclear threat. D mentions Vietnam, peace movement, and assassinations.

The Port Huron Statement was in 1962, and the organization (SDS) likely grew in the context of both civil rights and the Cold War. The Vietnam War escalated later in the decade, so maybe D is more about the mid to late 60s. But the initial growth after 1962 might have been driven more by the civil rights movement and Cold War fears.

Wait, but the question is about the growth through the remainder of the 1960s. So the 60s saw both the civil rights movement and the escalation of Vietnam. The organization's growth would have been influenced by these events. The peace movement and assassinations (like MLK and RFK) would have spurred more activism.

So D includes the Vietnam escalation, which was a major factor in the 1960s, especially as it escalated in the mid-60s. The peace movement would have been a response to that, and assassinations like MLK's in 1968 would have driven more activism.

Alternatively, H includes the civil rights movement, which was a big part of the early 60s, and the Cold War context. But the question is about the remainder of the 1960s, so maybe the later part is more about Vietnam and the peace movement.

I'm a bit torn between D and H. Let me think again.

The passage mentions the Cold War (nuclear threat) and racial bigotry (civil rights). So H's factors are directly tied to the passage's context. The growth of SDS would have been influenced by both the civil rights movement (as they were active in the South) and the fear of nuclear war. The spread of communism (as in the Cold War) would have been a backdrop.

But D's factors include the Vietnam War, which became a major focus for SDS and other activist groups in the latter part of the decade. The peace movement and assassinations would have mobilized a lot of people, including students.

So both D and H have relevant points. The question is which context best explains the growth through the remainder of the 1960s.

The Port Huron Statement was in 1962, which is early in the decade. The organization's growth probably continued as the decade went on, influenced by both civil rights and the Vietnam War. But the options are about the context, so which factors were most influential.

In the passage, both the civil rights struggle and the Cold War (nuclear threat) are mentioned as the main troubling events that moved people to activism. So the growth of SDS would be in the context of these two main issues.

Looking at the options again, H is "the rise of the civil rights movement, the spread of communism, and the threat of nuclear war." That seems to align well with the passage's focus.

Option D includes the Vietnam War, which is part of the Cold War but more specific. The peace movement and assassinations would have been significant, but the initial factors mentioned in the passage are civil rights and the Cold War.

So I think H is the best answer because it directly ties to the two main issues highlighted in the passage: human degradation (civil rights) and the Cold War (nuclear threat and spread of communism).

The growth of the organization that published the Port Huron Statement, Students for a Democratic Society (SDS), during the remainder of the 1960s can be best understood in the context of the rise of the civil rights movement, the spread of communism, and the threat of nuclear war. These factors align closely with the issues highlighted in the passage, which emphasize the troubling events of human degradation (symbolized by racial bigotry) and the Cold War (symbolized by the presence of the Bomb). While the Vietnam War and the peace movement were significant later in the decade, the passage specifically focuses on the early 1960s context of racial struggles and Cold War fears, making option H the most relevant.

Answer: H
