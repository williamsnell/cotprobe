Okay, so I'm looking at this question about group tasks and how the performance is limited by the least skilled member. The question is asking for the correct term that fits in the blank. The options given are A through J, and I need to figure out which one is correct.

First, I remember that there are different types of tasks in group settings. I think the key here is understanding how the group's performance relates to each member's skills. The question states that the group's performance is limited by the least skilled member. That makes me think of tasks where everyone's contributions are necessary, and if one person isn't performing well, it affects the whole group.

Wait, I think there's a specific term for tasks where the group's success depends on all members performing well. I'm trying to recall from what I've studied. There's something about additive tasks where individual contributions are added together, but in that case, the group's performance would be the sum of all members' efforts. So if one person is weak, their contribution is just added, not necessarily a bottleneck.

Then there's conjunctive tasks. From what I remember, a conjunctive task requires all group members to perform well for the task to succeed. It's like a weakest link scenario. If even one person doesn't do their part, the whole task fails. For example, building a bridge where each part must be strong enough; if one part is weak, the bridge might collapse. So in this case, the group's performance is limited by the weakest member, which fits the question.

Let me think about the other options to make sure I'm not mixing things up. There's additive, which I mentioned beforeâ€”it's more about combining individual strengths. Divisible tasks can be split among members, but the overall performance isn't necessarily limited by any single member. Sequential tasks are done one after another, so maybe the slowest person affects the timeline, but that's more about time than skill.

Compensatory tasks allow stronger members to cover for weaker ones, so the group's performance isn't limited by the weakest. That's the opposite of what the question is saying. Complementary tasks require different skills, but it doesn't directly relate to being limited by the weakest. Synchronized tasks require coordination but again, not necessarily about the weakest link.

So putting it all together, the term that fits is conjunctive because the group's success depends on all members, and the weakest member can hold the group back. Therefore, the answer should be B: conjunctive.

The correct term describing a task where the group's performance is limited by the least skilled member is **conjunctive**. This is because, in such tasks, all members' contributions are necessary, and the group's success depends on the weakest link.

Answer: B
