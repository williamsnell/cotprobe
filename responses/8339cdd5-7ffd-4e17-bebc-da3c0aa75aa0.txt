Okay, so I've got this question about discounts on a sight draft, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

Friedman Brothers accepted a 60-day sight draft on April 10 for $562.50. It was discounted on April 15 at 6%. I need to find the proceeds. The options are from A to J, and I have to choose the right one.

Hmm, I remember that when you discount a draft, you're essentially getting the present value of that amount, considering the interest that's been applied over the period. So the formula for calculating the discount is something like the face value minus the interest, right? Or maybe it's the present value, which is face value multiplied by (1 minus the discount rate over time). I'm not entirely sure, but I'll try to recall.

First, let's figure out how many days the draft is outstanding for. The draft was accepted on April 10 and discounted on April 15. So from April 10 to April 15 is 5 days. But the total term of the draft is 60 days. Wait, no, the discounting happens on April 15, so the period from April 15 to the maturity date (April 10 + 60 days) is what we need to calculate the discount on.

Wait, let me clarify the dates. April has 30 days, right? So April 10 plus 60 days would be May 10th. Because April has 30 days, so April 10 + 20 days is April 30, and then 40 more days brings us to May 10. So the maturity date is May 10.

Now, the discounting happened on April 15. So the period from April 15 to May 10 is how many days? Let's count. April 15 to April 30 is 16 days (since 30-15=15, but including the 15th, so 16 days). Then from May 1 to May 10 is 10 days. So total days is 16 + 10 = 26 days.

So the discount period is 26 days, and the rate is 6% per annum. I think the formula for discount is (face value) multiplied by (rate) multiplied by (time in years), and then subtract that from the face value to get the proceeds.

Wait, but sometimes it's calculated as (face value) * (1 - (rate * time)), which might be the same thing. Let me check.

The discount amount would be F × r × t, where F is the face value, r is the annual interest rate, and t is the time in years. So I need to convert 26 days into years. Since a year is 360 days in banking terms (I think), t would be 26/360.

So, F is $562.50, r is 6% or 0.06, t is 26/360.

Let's compute the discount: 562.50 * 0.06 * (26/360).

First, calculate 0.06 * (26/360). 26 divided by 360 is approximately 0.072222. Multiply that by 0.06 gives 0.0043333.

Then multiply by 562.50: 562.50 * 0.0043333 ≈ ?

Let me calculate that. 562.50 * 0.004 is 2.25. 562.50 * 0.0003333 is approximately 0.1875. So total discount is approximately 2.25 + 0.1875 = 2.4375.

So the discount is about $2.44. Then the proceeds would be the face value minus this discount: 562.50 - 2.44 = 560.06.

Wait, but that's not matching any of the options exactly. Let me check if I did the math right.

Alternatively, maybe I should compute it more accurately. Let's calculate 26/360 first. 26 divided by 360 equals 0.0722222222. Then multiply by 0.06: 0.0722222222 * 0.06 = 0.0043333333.

Now, 562.50 * 0.0043333333. Let's compute that:

562.50 * 0.004 = 2.25.

562.50 * 0.0003333333 ≈ 0.1875.

Adding together: 2.25 + 0.1875 = 2.4375.

So the discount is $2.4375, which is approximately $2.44.

Subtracting that from $562.50: 562.50 - 2.4375 = 560.0625.

Looking at the options, option C is $560.00, which is very close. But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the number of days.

Wait, from April 15 to May 10 is 26 days? Let me recount. April has 30 days, so from April 15 to April 30 is 16 days (including the 15th). Then May 1 to May 10 is 10 days, so total 26 days. That seems correct.

But another thought: sometimes, when calculating the discount period, the starting date is the day after the discount date. So from April 15 to May 10 is 26 days, but perhaps the calculation is based on whether the 15th is included or not. Wait, in banking calculations, usually, the day of discounting is not counted. So from April 15 to April 16 is one day. So from April 15 to May 10 is 25 days.

Wait, that could be a mistake. Let me check again. If the discount is on April 15, then the period starts on April 16. So from April 16 to May 10.

April has 30 days, so April 16 to April 30 is 15 days. Then May 1 to May 10 is 10 days. So total 25 days.

Oh! So I think I miscalculated earlier. It should be 25 days, not 26. Because the discount period starts the day after the discount date.

So that changes things. Let me redo the calculation with 25 days.

t = 25/360.

So the discount amount is 562.50 * 0.06 * (25/360).

First, 25/360 = 0.0694444444.

0.06 * 0.0694444444 ≈ 0.0041666666.

Multiply by 562.50: 562.50 * 0.0041666666 ≈ ?

Well, 562.50 * 0.004 = 2.25.

562.50 * 0.0001666666 ≈ 0.09375.

Adding together: 2.25 + 0.09375 = 2.34375.

So the discount is $2.34375.

Proceeds = 562.50 - 2.34375 = 560.15625.

Hmm, that's approximately $560.16. But that's still not matching the options exactly. Let me check the options again.

Options are:

A: 562.50

B:557.34

C:560.00

D:555.34

E:559.90

F:550.00

G:558.50

H:553.25

I:5.16

J:565.75

Wait, option C is $560.00, which is close to my calculation of $560.16. But perhaps I should compute more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps using simple interest formula: I = P × r × t.

Where P is $562.50, r is 6% per annum, t is 25/360 years.

So I = 562.50 * 0.06 * (25/360).

Let me compute 0.06*(25/360) first.

25/360 is approximately 0.069444.

0.06 * 0.069444 = 0.00416664.

Now, 562.50 * 0.00416664.

Let me compute 562.50 * 0.004 = 2.25.

562.50 * 0.00016664 ≈ 0.093765.

Adding them: 2.25 + 0.093765 ≈ 2.343765.

So the discount is approximately $2.343765, so the proceeds are 562.50 - 2.343765 ≈ 560.156235, which is about $560.16.

But none of the options is exactly $560.16. The closest is option C, $560.00, but that's a bit off. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the days.

Wait another thought: perhaps the discount period is 26 days, including the 15th. So if the discount is on the 15th, the period is from the 15th to the 10th of May, which is 26 days.

Wait, let me think again. If the draft was accepted on April 10, and the maturity is 60 days later, that's May 10. If it's discounted on April 15, the period from April 15 to May 10 is 26 days.

So perhaps I should use 26 days.

Let me calculate with 26 days.

t = 26/360.

I = 562.50 * 0.06 * (26/360).

26/360 ≈ 0.072222.

0.06 * 0.072222 ≈ 0.0043333.

562.50 * 0.0043333 ≈ ?

As before, 562.50 * 0.004 = 2.25.

562.50 * 0.0003333 ≈ 0.1875.

Total discount: 2.25 + 0.1875 = 2.4375.

So proceeds: 562.50 - 2.4375 = 560.0625, approximately $560.06.

Again, close to $560.06, so the closest option is C: $560.00.

But wait, let me check the options again. Option E is $559.90, which is a bit lower. Maybe my approach is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the present value formula, which is PV = FV / (1 + r*t). But I'm not sure if that's applicable here because discounting can be either simple interest or bank discount.

Wait, in the case of a sight draft, the discounting is usually based on the simple interest calculation. So the formula is:

Discount = F × r × t

Proceeds = F - Discount.

So, using 26 days, as I did earlier, leads to a discount of approximately $2.44, so proceeds are $560.06, which is close to $560.00.

But looking at the options, option B is $557.34, which is lower. Maybe I did something wrong in the days calculation.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try using the formula for bank discount:

Proceeds = F × (1 - (r × t))

Where t is days/360.

So with 26 days, t = 26/360.

r = 6% = 0.06.

So 1 - (0.06 × 26/360) = 1 - (0.0043333) = 0.9956667.

Then, 562.50 × 0.9956667 ≈ ?

Let me compute that: 562.50 * 0.9956667.

I can compute 562.50 × 0.9956667 as 562.50 × (1 - 0.0043333) = 562.50 - (562.50 × 0.0043333).

Which is the same as before: 562.50 - 2.4375 = 560.0625.

So again, around $560.06.

But none of the options is exactly that. Option C is $560.00, which is very close. Alternatively, perhaps the question uses 365 days for the year, but that's less common in banking calculations.

Wait, another approach: maybe the time is calculated as the number of days from April 15 to May 10 inclusive or exclusive.

Wait, if the discount is on April 15, the period starts on April 16. So from April 16 to May 10 is 25 days.

So t = 25/360.

Then, discount = 562.50 × 0.06 × (25/360).

Calculating that:

25/360 = 0.0694444.

0.06 × 0.0694444 ≈ 0.00416666.

562.50 × 0.00416666 ≈ 2.34375.

So proceeds = 562.50 - 2.34375 = 560.15625.

Again, about $560.16, which is close to $560.00.

But perhaps the options are rounded. Let me check the options again. Option C is $560.00, which is the closest.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the days.

Wait, another way: April has 30 days, so from April 15 to April 30 is 16 days (including the 15th). Then May 1 to May 10 is 10 days. So 16 + 10 = 26 days. So perhaps the correct period is 26 days.

In that case, the discount is 562.50 × 0.06 × (26/360) = 2.4375.

So proceeds = 562.50 - 2.4375 = 560.0625, which is approximately $560.06.

Looking at the options, the closest is C: $560.00.

But wait, let me think again. Maybe the question is using 360 days in a year, but perhaps the rate is applied differently. Alternatively, perhaps the discount is calculated as 6% per annum simple interest, so the formula is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the discount is calculated using the actual number of days in the year, but that's less likely.

Wait, let me try calculating the discount using 25 days.

So 25/360 = 0.0694444.

0.06 × 0.0694444 = 0.00416666.

562.50 × 0.00416666 ≈ 2.34375.

So proceeds = 562.50 - 2.34375 = 560.15625.

Which is $560.16, still close to $560.00.

But none of the options exactly match. Let me check if I did the math correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is expecting me to calculate the discount from the date of discounting to the maturity date, which is 26 days, leading to the proceeds being $560.00, which is option C.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is B: $557.34, which is lower. I'm confused now.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the exact amount using the formula for the discount.

Let me compute the discount amount precisely.

For 26 days:

Discount = 562.50 × 0.06 × (26/360).

Compute 26/360 first: 26 ÷ 360 = 0.072222222.

Multiply by 0.06: 0.072222222 × 0.06 = 0.0043333333.

Now, 562.50 × 0.0043333333.

Let me compute that:

562.50 × 0.004 = 2.25.

562.50 × 0.0003333333 ≈ 562.50 × 0.0003333333 = 0.1875.

So adding together: 2.25 + 0.1875 = 2.4375.

So discount is $2.4375.

Proceeds: 562.50 - 2.4375 = 560.0625.

So $560.0625, which is approximately $560.06.

Looking back at the options, the closest is C: $560.00.

But wait, let me check the options again. Option B is $557.34, which is $5 less. Maybe I did the days wrong.

Wait, perhaps the time is calculated as 24 days. Let me see.

From April 15 to May 10 is 26 days if including both start and end dates, but sometimes the end date is not counted.

Alternatively, perhaps the period is 25 days.

Wait, maybe the correct period is 25 days because the discount is on the 15th, so the first day is the 16th.

So let me compute with 25 days.

So discount = 562.50 × 0.06 × (25/360).

25/360 = 0.0694444.

0.06 × 0.0694444 ≈ 0.00416666.

562.50 × 0.00416666 ≈ 2.34375.

Proceeds: 562.50 - 2.34375 = 560.15625.

Still around $560.16.

But none of the options match. Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option B: $557.34, but I'm not sure why.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Maybe the discount is calculated as (rate × time) × face value, but perhaps the rate is applied differently.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the discount rate is 6% per annum, so the daily rate is 6% / 360 = 0.0166667% per day.

So for 26 days, the discount would be 562.50 × 0.0166667% × 26.

Wait, no, that's incorrect. The rate is 6% per annum, so per day it's 0.06 / 360 = 0.000166667.

So for each day, the discount is 562.50 × 0.000166667.

So for 26 days: 562.50 × 0.000166667 × 26.

Compute 0.000166667 × 26 = 0.00433334.

Then 562.50 × 0.00433334 ≈ 2.4375, same as before.

So proceeds are 562.50 - 2.4375 = 560.0625.

Hmm, same result.

Looking at the options, the closest is C: $560.00.

But wait, another thought: perhaps the discount period is 26 days, but the rate is 6% per annum, so using 365 days in a year? Let me try that.

t = 26/365 ≈ 0.071232877.

Then discount = 562.50 × 0.06 × 0.071232877 ≈ 562.50 × 0.00427397 ≈ ?

562.50 × 0.004 = 2.25.

562.50 × 0.00027397 ≈ 0.15374.

Total discount ≈ 2.25 + 0.15374 ≈ 2.40374.

Proceeds ≈ 562.50 - 2.40374 ≈ 560.09626, which is about $560.10.

Still close to $560.10, but not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option B: $557.34. Let me see how that could happen.

Wait, perhaps the maturity period is 60 days from April 10, which would be May 10, as I thought. But if the discount is on April 15, then the period is 26 days.

Alternatively, perhaps the discount rate is applied on the face value for 26 days, but using a different formula.

Wait, maybe the formula is:

Proceeds = Face Value × [1 - (Discount Rate × Time)]

So again, 1 - (0.06 × 26/360) = 1 - 0.0043333 = 0.9956667.

Then, 562.50 × 0.9956667 = ?

Let me compute 562.50 × 0.9956667.

Multiply 562.50 by 0.9956667:

First, 562.50 × 0.9956667 = ?

I can compute this as 562.50 × (1 - 0.0043333) = 562.50 - (562.50 × 0.0043333) = 562.50 - 2.4375 = 560.0625.

Same result again.

So the proceeds are $560.0625, which is approximately $560.06.

But since the options don't have that, the closest is C: $560.00.

Wait, perhaps the options are rounded down. So the correct answer would be C.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of days. Let me recount.

April 15 to May 10:

April has 30 days. From April 15 to April 30 is 16 days (including the 15th). Then May 1 to May 10 is 10 days. Total 26 days.

Wait, but if the discount is on April 15, does the period start on April 15 or April 16? I think it's April 16, so 25 days.

So t = 25/360.

Then discount = 562.50 × 0.06 × (25/360) = 562.50 × 0.0041666667 ≈ 2.34375.

Proceeds = 562.50 - 2.34375 = 560.15625 ≈ $560.16.

But again, no option matches exactly.

Wait, looking back at the options, option E is $559.90, which is close to $560.00.

Alternatively, perhaps the discount is calculated using 365 days in a year, but that's less common.

Wait, let's try 365 days.

t = 26/365 ≈ 0.071232877.

Discount = 562.50 × 0.06 × 0.071232877 ≈ 562.50 × 0.00427397 ≈ 2.40374.

Proceeds = 562.50 - 2.40374 ≈ 560.09626, which is approximately $560.10.

Still, the closest option is C: $560.00.

But wait, perhaps I should check if the discount period is 25 days, leading to $560.15625, which is approximately $560.16. But the options don't have that either.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option B: $557.34. But I can't see how that would happen unless the discount period is longer.

Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating the days. Let me think again.

If the draft was accepted on April 10, and it's a 60-day draft, it matures on May 10.

Discounted on April 15, so the period from April 15 to May 10 is 26 days.

So t = 26/360.

So discount = 562.50 × 0.06 × (26/360) = 562.50 × 0.0043333 ≈ 2.4375.

Proceeds = 562.50 - 2.4375 = 560.0625.

So around $560.06, which is closest to option C: $560.00.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is option B: $557.34, but I'm not sure why.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the formula. Perhaps the discount is calculated as F × r × t, but perhaps the rate is 6% per annum, so the daily rate is 6% / 360 = 0.0166667%. So for 26 days, the discount is 562.50 × 0.0166667% × 26.

Wait, that would be:

0.0166667% per day × 26 days = 0.4333342% total.

Then, 562.50 × 0.4333342% = 562.50 × 0.00433334 ≈ 2.4375.

Same as before. So proceeds are $560.0625.

So I think the correct answer is option C: $560.00.
</think>

To determine the proceeds after discounting the sight draft, we calculate the discount using the formula:

\[
\text{Discount} = F \times r \times t
\]

Where:
- \( F = \$562.50 \) (face value),
- \( r = 6\% \) (annual interest rate),
- \( t \) is the time in years.

The draft was discounted on April 15, 2023, and matures on May 10, 2023 (60 days from April 10). The discount period is from April 15 to May 10, which is 26 days. Converting days to years:

\[
t = \frac{26}{360} \approx 0.072222
\]

Calculating the discount:

\[
\text{Discount} = 562.50 \times 0.06 \times 0.072222 \approx 2.4375
\]

The proceeds are:

\[
\text{Proceeds} = 562.50 - 2.4375 = 560.0625 \approx \$560.06
\]

Among the options, the closest value is **\$560.00**.

**Answer: C**
