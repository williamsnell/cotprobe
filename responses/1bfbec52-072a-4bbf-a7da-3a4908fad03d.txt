Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the inverse Laplace transform of F(s) = (3s + 1)/[(s - 1)(s² + 1)]. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on Laplace transforms, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

First, I remember that the inverse Laplace transform can often be found by breaking the function into partial fractions. So, I should try to express F(s) as a sum of simpler fractions that I can recognize.

The denominator is (s - 1)(s² + 1). So, I can write F(s) as A/(s - 1) + (Bs + C)/(s² + 1), where A, B, and C are constants I need to find.

Let me set up the equation:

(3s + 1)/[(s - 1)(s² + 1)] = A/(s - 1) + (Bs + C)/(s² + 1)

To find A, B, and C, I'll multiply both sides by the denominator (s - 1)(s² + 1) to get rid of the fractions:

3s + 1 = A(s² + 1) + (Bs + C)(s - 1)

Now, I'll expand the right-hand side:

A(s² + 1) = A s² + A
(Bs + C)(s - 1) = B s² - Bs + Cs - C

So combining these:
A s² + A + B s² - B s + C s - C

Now, group like terms:
(A + B)s² + ( -B + C)s + (A - C)

This should equal the left-hand side, which is 3s + 1. So, I can write the equation as:

(A + B)s² + ( -B + C)s + (A - C) = 0 s² + 3 s + 1

Since this must hold for all s, the coefficients of corresponding powers of s must be equal.

So, setting up the equations:

1. Coefficient of s²: A + B = 0
2. Coefficient of s: -B + C = 3
3. Constant term: A - C = 1

Now, I have a system of three equations:

A + B = 0
-B + C = 3
A - C = 1

Let me solve this system.

From equation 1: B = -A

Substitute B = -A into equation 2:

-(-A) + C = 3 → A + C = 3 → C = 3 - A

Now, substitute C = 3 - A into equation 3:

A - (3 - A) = 1 → A -3 + A = 1 → 2A -3 =1 → 2A=4 → A=2

Now, since A=2, from equation 1, B = -2.

And from C=3 - A, C=3 -2=1.

So, A=2, B=-2, C=1.

Now, the partial fractions decomposition is:

F(s) = A/(s -1) + (Bs + C)/(s² +1) = 2/(s -1) + (-2s +1)/(s² +1)

Now, I need to find the inverse Laplace transform of each term.

The inverse Laplace transform of 2/(s -1) is 2 e^{t}, because L{e^{at}} = 1/(s -a), so here a=1.

Next term: (-2s +1)/(s² +1). Let's split this into two parts:

= (-2s)/(s² +1) + 1/(s² +1)

The inverse Laplace of (-2s)/(s² +1) is -2 cos t, because L{cos t} = s/(s² +1), so it's scaled by -2.

The inverse Laplace of 1/(s² +1) is sin t, because L{sin t} = 1/(s² +1).

Putting it all together:

f(t) = 2 e^{t} - 2 cos t + sin t.

Wait, looking at the options, let me check each one.

Option I is e^t - 2 cos t + 2 sin t. Hmm, no, because my result is 2 e^t -2 cos t + sin t.

Wait, let me check the options again.

Looking at the options:

A: 3e^t + sin t - cos t

B: e^t - cos t + sin t

C: e^t - sin t - cos t

D: e^t + cos t - 2 sin t

E: 3e^t - cos t - 2 sin t

F: 2e^t + sin t + 2 cos t

G: 2e^t - 2 cos t + sin t

H: 2e^t - 2 sin t + cos t

I: e^t - 2 cos t + 2 sin t

J: 2e^t + 2 cos t - sin t

Wait, in my calculation, I have 2e^t -2 cos t + sin t. Let me check which option that is.

Looking through the options, option G is 2e^t - 2 cos t + sin t. So that's what I have. But wait, let me double-check my partial fractions, because I might have made a mistake.

Wait, the partial fractions step: F(s) = 2/(s-1) + (-2s +1)/(s² +1). So when I split (-2s +1)/(s² +1), I get (-2s)/(s² +1) + 1/(s² +1).

Inverse of (-2s)/(s² +1) is -2 cos t, and 1/(s² +1) is sin t. So f(t) = 2 e^t -2 cos t + sin t. That's correct.

So looking at the options, that's option G.

The inverse Laplace transform of F(s) is found by decomposing it into partial fractions and applying known transforms. The result is 2e^t - 2 cos t + sin t, which corresponds to option G.

Answer: G
