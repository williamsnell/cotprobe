Okay, so I have this question about bond pricing, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question is asking for the price of a three-year bond with a face value of $100. It pays 5% coupons, and the yield is 6%. The options are A through J, with various dollar amounts.

First, I need to remember how bond pricing works. From what I recall, the price of a bond is the present value of all its future cash flows, discounted at the yield rate. So, for this bond, the cash flows would be the coupon payments each year and the face value at maturity.

The bond has a face value of $100, and it pays 5% coupons. So, each year, the coupon payment should be 5% of $100, which is $5. That makes sense because 5% of 100 is 5. So, every year, the bondholder gets $5.

Now, the yield is 6%. I think this is the market interest rate or the discount rate. So, I need to discount those coupon payments and the face value back to the present using 6% as the discount rate.

Since it's a three-year bond, there are three coupon payments: one at the end of each year, and then the face value at the end of the third year.

I remember the formula for bond pricing is the sum of the present value of each coupon plus the present value of the face value. So, mathematically, it's:

Price = (Coupon / (1 + y)^1) + (Coupon / (1 + y)^2) + (Coupon / (1 + y)^3) + (Face Value / (1 + y)^3)

Where y is the yield, which is 6% or 0.06 in decimal.

Let me plug in the numbers.

Coupon each year is $5. The yield is 6%, so y = 0.06.

Calculating each part:

First coupon: $5 / (1.06)^1 = 5 / 1.06 ≈ 4.71698
Second coupon: 5 / (1.06)^2 ≈ 5 / 1.1236 ≈ 4.4538
Third coupon: 5 / (1.06)^3 ≈ 5 / 1.191016 ≈ 4.1988

Face value at year 3: 100 / (1.06)^3 ≈ 100 / 1.191016 ≈ 83.9619

Now, adding all these up:

First coupon: ~4.71698
Second coupon: ~4.4538
Third coupon: ~4.1988
Face value: ~83.9619

Adding the coupons: 4.71698 + 4.4538 = 9.17078; plus 4.1988 gives 13.36958.

Adding the face value: 13.36958 + 83.9619 ≈ 97.33148.

So the total price is approximately $97.33. Looking at the options, option D is $97.33.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Maybe I should calculate each present value more accurately.

First coupon: 5 / 1.06 = 4.716981137
Second coupon: 5 / (1.06)^2 = 5 / 1.1236 = 4.453822854
Third coupon: 5 / (1.06)^3 = 5 / 1.191016 ≈ 4.198795484
Face value: 100 / (1.06)^3 ≈ 83.96189686

Adding them up:

4.716981137 + 4.453822854 = 9.170803991
9.170803991 + 4.198795484 = 13.369599475
13.369599475 + 83.96189686 ≈ 97.33149633

So yes, that's about $97.33. So the answer should be D. But wait, sometimes I might confuse the yield with the coupon rate, but in this case, since the coupon rate is lower than the yield, the bond should be priced below face value, so under $100. All the options under $100 are A, C, D, E, H, I. Wait, no: I need to check the options again.

Looking at the options: A is 98.25, C is 96.71, D is 97.33, E is 99.67, H is 95.33. So D is 97.33, which matches my calculation.

Alternatively, I could have used the present value of an ordinary annuity formula for the coupons. The present value of an annuity of $5 for 3 years at 6% would be:

PV = C * [(1 - (1 + y)^-n) / y]

Where C is 5, y is 0.06, n is 3.

So,

PV_coupons = 5 * [ (1 - 1/(1.06)^3 ) / 0.06 ]

Calculating 1/(1.06)^3: that's approximately 0.839619.

So 1 - 0.839619 = 0.160381.

Divide by 0.06: 0.160381 / 0.06 ≈ 2.673017.

Multiply by 5: 5 * 2.673017 ≈ 13.365085.

Then add the present value of the face value, which is 100 / 1.06^3 ≈ 83.961896.

Total price: 13.365085 + 83.961896 ≈ 97.326981, which rounds to $97.33. So that confirms it.

I think I'm confident that D is the correct answer.
</think>

The price of the bond is calculated by discounting the future cash flows (coupons and face value) at the yield rate of 6%. The coupon payments are $5 each year, and the face value is $100. Using the present value formula for each cash flow and summing them up gives a total price of approximately $97.33.
