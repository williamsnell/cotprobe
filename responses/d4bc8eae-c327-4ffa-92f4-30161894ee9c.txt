Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with collision rates and electron movement, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says: If the average distance the free electrons travel between collisions in copper is 4 × 10^-8 meters, how many collisions per second do the electrons make? And also, what's the time between collisions? The average electron speed is given as 1.21 × 10^6 m/s.

Hmm, right. So, I remember that when electrons move through a conductor like copper, they don't move in straight lines forever because they collide with atoms or other electrons. The distance they travel between two collisions is called the mean free path. I think the mean free path (λ) is given here as 4e-8 meters.

The first thing I need to find is the number of collisions per second, which is the collision rate. Then, from that, I can find the time between collisions, which is just the reciprocal of the collision rate.

So, let me think. The average speed (v) is 1.21e6 m/s. The mean free path (λ) is 4e-8 m. So, how do I relate these to find the collision rate?

Oh wait, the collision rate (Z) would be the number of collisions per second. I think the formula is Z = v / λ. Because if each collision happens after the electron travels λ distance, then the number of collisions per second is the speed divided by the distance between collisions.

Let me write that down:

Z = v / λ

Plugging in the numbers:

v = 1.21e6 m/s
λ = 4e-8 m

So Z = (1.21e6) / (4e-8) 

Let me compute that. First, 1.21 divided by 4 is approximately 0.3025. Then, 1e6 divided by 1e-8 is 1e14, because 1e6 / 1e-8 = 1e14. So 0.3025e14 is 3.025e13 collisions per second.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is 2.0e13, B is 3.8e13, etc. My calculation gives around 3.0e13, which isn't exactly matching any option. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, wait. Let me double-check the calculation. 1.21e6 divided by 4e-8.

Let me calculate it more accurately. 1.21 divided by 4 is 0.3025. Then, 1e6 divided by 1e-8 is 1e14 because 1e6 /1e-8 = 1e14. So 0.3025e14 is 3.025e13. Oh, that's about 3.0e13 collisions per second. Looking at the options, option H is 3.0e13 and time is 3.3e-14 s.

But wait, another way to look at it: maybe the collision rate is v divided by λ. Because the time between collisions would be the time it takes to travel λ at speed v. So time between collisions t is λ / v. Then, the collision rate is 1/t, which is v/λ. So that part seems correct.

So Z = v/λ = (1.21e6) / (4e-8) = (1.21 /4) * 1e14 = 0.3025 * 1e14 = 3.025e13 per second.

Looking at the options, option H is 3.0e13 collisions/s. So that's the first part. Now, the time between collisions is the reciprocal of Z, so t = 1/Z.

So t = 1/(3.025e13) ≈ 3.3e-14 seconds. Because 1/(3e13) is approximately 3.333e-14. So t ≈ 3.3e-14 s.

Looking at option H, which says 3.0e13 collisions/s and 3.3e-14 s. That matches exactly.

Wait, but let me check another option. Option B says 3.8e13 and 2.6e-14. Maybe I made a mistake in the division.

Wait, perhaps I should do the division more accurately. Let me compute 1.21e6 / 4e-8.

1.21e6 is 1,210,000, and 4e-8 is 0.00000004. So 1,210,000 divided by 0.00000004.

Another way to compute this: 1.21e6 /4e-8 = (1.21 /4) * 1e14 = 0.3025 * 1e14 = 3.025e13. So that's correct.

So, the collision rate is approximately 3.0e13 collisions per second, and the time between collisions is 3.3e-14 seconds. So option H matches both.

Wait, but let me make sure there's no alternative approach. Another possible formula could involve the drift velocity, but I don't think that's relevant here. The given speed is the average speed, not the drift velocity. Drift velocity is much smaller, but here it's given as the average speed between collisions, so we should use that.

So, yes, I think option H is correct.

To determine the number of collisions per second and the time between collisions for electrons in copper, we start with the given data:

- Average distance between collisions (mean free path):  
  \[
  \lambda = 4 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{m}
  \]
- Average electron speed:  
  \[
  v = 1.21 \times 10^6 \, \text{m/s}
  \]

### Step 1: Calculate the collision rate (\(Z\))
The collision rate (\(Z\)) is the number of collisions per second and can be calculated using the formula:  
\[
Z = \frac{v}{\lambda}
\]
Substituting the given values:  
\[
Z = \frac{1.21 \times 10^6}{4 \times 10^{-8}} = \frac{1.21}{4} \times 10^{14} = 0.3025 \times 10^{14} = 3.025 \times 10^{13} \, \text{collisions/s}
\]
This rounds to approximately \(3.0 \times 10^{13} \, \text{collisions/s}\).

### Step 2: Calculate the time between collisions (\(t\))
The time between collisions (\(t\)) is the reciprocal of the collision rate:  
\[
t = \frac{1}{Z}
\]
Substituting \(Z = 3.025 \times 10^{13}\):  
\[
t = \frac{1}{3.025 \times 10^{13}} \approx 3.3 \times 10^{-14} \, \text{s}
\]

### Final Answer
The collision rate is \(3.0 \times 10^{13} \, \text{collisions/s}\), and the time between collisions is \(3.3 \times 10^{-14} \, \text{s}\). These values match **Option H**.
