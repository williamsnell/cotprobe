Alright, so I've got this problem here where I need to raise a phasor to the second and fifth powers. The phasor given is (8.66 + j5.0). Hmm, okay, phasors are complex numbers used in electrical engineering to represent sinusoidal functions, right? So I think I can treat this as a complex number and use De Moivre's theorem to raise it to the required powers.

First, I need to represent the phasor in polar form because that's easier when raising to a power. The polar form is r∠θ, where r is the magnitude and θ is the angle. To find r, I'll calculate the magnitude of the complex number 8.66 + j5.0. The formula for magnitude is r = sqrt(a² + b²), where a is the real part and b is the imaginary part.

So, plugging the numbers in: r = sqrt(8.66² + 5.0²). Let me calculate that. 8.66 squared is approximately 75, because 8.66 times 8.66 is around 75 (since 8^2 is 64, 9^2 is 81, and 8.66 is closer to 9, so 75 makes sense). 5 squared is 25. Adding those together gives 75 +25=100. So r is sqrt(100)=10. Oh, that's a nice round number. So the magnitude is 10.

Next, I need to find the angle θ. The angle can be found using the arctangent of (b/a), which is θ = arctan(b/a). Here, b is 5.0 and a is 8.66. So θ = arctan(5/8.66). Let me compute that. 5 divided by 8.66 is approximately 0.577. Arctan of 0.577 is about 30 degrees because tan(30°) is approximately 0.577. So θ is 30 degrees. That makes the phasor 10∠30°.

Now, the problem asks to raise this phasor to the second and fifth powers. Using De Moivre's theorem, which states that (r∠θ)^n = r^n ∠ (nθ), where n is the exponent. So for n=2, it becomes (10)^2 ∠ (2*30°) = 100∠60°. For n=5, it would be (10)^5 ∠ (5*30°)=100,000∠150°.

Wait, let me double-check the angle calculations. For the second power, 2*30=60°, correct. For the fifth power, 5*30=150°, that's right. And the magnitudes: 10 squared is 100, and 10^5 is 100,000. So the results should be 100∠60° and 100,000∠150°.

Looking at the options, I need to find which one has these two values. Let's go through each option:

Option A: 85∠75° and 85,000∠170°. No, the magnitudes and angles don't match.

Option B: 125∠55° and 125,000∠175°. Nope.

Option C: 80∠90° and 500,000∠180°. No, the magnitudes and angles don't fit.

Option D: 95∠65° and 95,000∠165°. Not matching.

Option E: 90∠70° and 90,000∠160°. No.

Option F: 75∠80° and 75,000∠200°. No.

Option G: 70∠85° and 70,000∠190°. No.

Option H: 150∠45° and 150,000∠225°. Magnitudes and angles wrong.

Option I: 110∠50° and 110,000∠140°. Nope.

Option J: 100∠60° and 100,000∠150°. Wow, that's exactly what I calculated. So option J is the correct one.

The phasor (8.66 + j5.0) has a magnitude of 10 and an angle of 30°, making it 10∠30°. Raising this to the second power gives 100∠60°, and to the fifth power gives 100,000∠150°. Option J matches these results.
