Question:

On January 1, year 1, a company purchased equipment for $100 million. The equipment consists of four major components, of which two components comprise 80% of the total cost and each has a 20-year useful life. The remaining two components have costs of $10 million each; one of them has a useful life of four years, and the other has a useful life of five years. The company applies the cost model to the equipment and uses the straight-line method of depreciation. Under IFRS, what is the depreciation expense for the year ended December 31, year 1?

Options:

A: $7,500,000
B: $5,000,000
C: $6,000,000
D: $8,000,000
E: $10,000,000
F: $9,500,000
G: $7,000,000
H: $4,000,000
I: $9,000,000
J: $8,500,000

Okay, so I need to figure out the depreciation expense for the year ended December 31, year 1, under IFRS. The company bought equipment for $100 million on January 1, year 1. The equipment has four major components, and each component's cost and useful life are different.

Let me break this down. The equipment has four parts. Two of them make up 80% of the total cost, so each of those two must cost $40 million because 80% of $100 million is $80 million, and since there are two, each is $40 million. These two have a 20-year useful life each.

The other two components each cost $10 million, so that's $10 million each. One of these has a 4-year life and the other a 5-year life.

Under IFRS, when a company applies the cost model and uses straight-line depreciation, each component's depreciation is calculated separately if they have different useful lives. So I can't just take the whole $100 million and divide it by an average life; instead, each part must be depreciated based on its own useful life.

So, let's calculate each component's annual depreciation.

First, the two big components: each is $40 million with a 20-year life. Straight-line means each year's depreciation is cost divided by useful life. So for each, it's $40M / 20 years = $2M per year. Since there are two of them, that's 2 * $2M = $4M per year.

Next, the two smaller components. The one costing $10 million with a 4-year life: depreciation is $10M / 4 = $2.5M per year. The other is $10M with a 5-year life: $10M /5 = $2M per year.

So adding all these up: $4M (from the two big ones) + $2.5M (from the 4-year component) + $2M (from the 5-year component) = $8.5M total depreciation for the first year.

Wait, but wait. The initial purchase was on January 1, year 1. So for the year ended December 31, year 1, there's a full year of depreciation. So the calculation is correct because each component starts depreciating from the date of purchase.

Let me check the options. Option J is $8,500,000, which matches my calculation.

The depreciation expense is calculated by depreciating each component separately based on its useful life. The two major components each cost $40 million and have a 20-year life, contributing $4 million annually. The remaining components, costing $10 million each, have 4- and 5-year lives, contributing $2.5 million and $2 million respectively. Adding these gives a total of $8.5 million.

Answer: J
