Question:

Suppose that the Durbin Watson test is applied to a regression containing two explanatory variables plus a constant with 50 data points. The test statistic takes a value of 1.53. What is the appropriate conclusion?

Options:

A: Residuals appear to be negatively autocorrelated
B: There is a strong linear relationship between the variables
C: The regression model is incorrectly specified
D: The residuals are heteroscedastic
E: Residuals appear not to be autocorrelated
F: The residuals are homoscedastic
G: There is no relationship between the variables
H: Residuals appear to be positively autocorrelated
I: Residuals appear to be perfectly autocorrelated
J: The test result is inconclusive

Okay, so I have this question about the Durbin-Watson test, and I need to figure out the correct conclusion based on the given test statistic. Let me start by recalling what I know about the Durbin-Watson (DW) test.

The DW test is used to detect the presence of autocorrelation in the residuals from a regression analysis. Autocorrelation occurs when the residuals (the errors) are correlated with each other, which can happen if there's a pattern or structure in the data that the model isn't capturing.

The test statistic ranges roughly between 0 and 4. I remember that if the statistic is close to 2, it suggests no autocorrelation. If it's significantly lower than 2, like around 1, it indicates positive autocorrelation. Conversely, if it's significantly higher than 2, around 3, it might suggest negative autocorrelation.

In this case, the test statistic is 1.53. Hmm, that's less than 2, so it's on the lower side. So that would lean towards positive autocorrelation. Wait, but how does that compare to the critical values for the test?

I think the critical values depend on the number of explanatory variables and the sample size. The question says there are two explanatory variables plus a constant, so that's two variables, and the sample size is 50. I should check the critical values for DW statistic with n=50 and k=2.

I don't remember the exact critical values, but I think for a two-tailed test at a 5% significance level, the lower and upper critical values are around 1.6 and 2.6, respectively. So, if the DW statistic is less than the lower critical value (1.6), we reject the null hypothesis of no autocorrelation in favor of positive autocorrelation. If it's above the upper critical value (2.6), we'd reject in favor of negative autocorrelation. If it's between, the test is inconclusive.

So here, the statistic is 1.53, which is below 1.6. That means we can conclude that there's positive autocorrelation. Looking at the options, H says residuals appear to be positively autocorrelated. Option A says negatively, which would be higher than 2. So H is looking correct.

Wait, but wait. Some sources say that when the statistic is around 1, it's definitely positive. So with 1.53, it's below 2, so positive. So the conclusion should be H.

Let me double-check the options. Option E says residuals are not autocorrelated, but since 1.53 is less than 2, that's not the case. Option J says inconclusive, but since it's below the lower critical value, it's conclusive, so J isn't right. So the answer should be H.

The Durbin-Watson test statistic of 1.53, which is less than the lower critical value of approximately 1.6 for a sample size of 50 and two explanatory variables, indicates the presence of positive autocorrelation in the residuals. Therefore, the appropriate conclusion is that the residuals appear to be positively autocorrelated.
