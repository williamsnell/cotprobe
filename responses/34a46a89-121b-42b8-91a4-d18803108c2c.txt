Okay, so I've got this question about the synoptic Gospels. I'm a bit rusty on my Bible knowledge, but I'll try to think it through. First, I remember that the term "synoptic" has something to do with seeing things together or from a common view. I think the synoptic Gospels are the ones that are similar in content and structure, so they probably share a lot of the same stories and teachings.

I know the four Gospels are Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. John is often considered different because it has a more unique structure and content, focusing more on the miracles and the theological aspects. So John might not be part of the synoptic ones. That eliminates options that include John, like A, B, D, I, and J.

Wait, let me check the options again. Option D is Matthew, Mark, John. Since John is likely not synoptic, D is out. Option E is Matthew, Mark, Luke. That seems right because I've heard that these three are grouped together as synoptic. But let me make sure.

I remember that Mark is often called the "earliest" Gospel, but I'm not entirely sure. Some scholars think that Mark was the first to be written, and then Matthew and Luke used Mark as a source. So if Mark is the base, then the other two would be Matthew and Luke. That would make the synoptic Gospels Matthew, Mark, and Luke. So option E matches that.

Looking at other options, option B is John, Luke, Mark. But as I thought earlier, John is probably not included. Option C is Peter, John, Mark. Wait, Peter isn't one of the canonical Gospels. The Gospels are attributed to Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. So options that include Peter, like C, G, H, J, are probably wrong because they're not part of the official New Testament books.

Option F is Mark, Luke, Paul. Paul isn't a Gospel writer; he wrote epistles. So F is definitely incorrect. Option A includes Paul as well, so that's out too.

Option E is the only one left that makes sense. It includes the three Gospels that are considered synoptic because they share so much material and are structurally similar. So the answer should be E.

The synoptic Gospels are Matthew, Mark, and Luke, as they share similar content and structure. John is distinct and not included. Options with non-canonical authors like Peter or Paul are incorrect. The correct answer is E.

Answer: E
