Okay, so I've got this question about the interior angles of a regular octagon. The sign outside Bob's Burger Barn is a regular octagon shape, and I need to figure out how many degrees are in each interior angle. I've got multiple-choice options, so I'll have to think through this step by step.

First, I remember that a regular octagon has all sides equal and all interior angles equal. So, each angle should be the same. I think the formula for the sum of interior angles of a polygon is something like (n-2) multiplied by 180 degrees, where n is the number of sides. Yeah, that sounds right. So for an octagon, n is 8.

Let me write that down. The sum of the interior angles would be (8-2) * 180. That's 6 * 180. Hmm, 6 times 180 is 1080 degrees. So the total of all interior angles is 1080 degrees.

Since it's a regular octagon, each angle is the same. So to find one interior angle, I need to divide that total by 8. So 1080 divided by 8. Let me do that calculation. 1080 รท 8 equals 135. So each interior angle is 135 degrees.

Let me check the options. The options are A:90, B:45, C:75, D:150, E:120, F:180, G:105, H:135, I:60. So H is 135, which matches my calculation.

Wait, just to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Another way to think about it: I remember that for regular polygons, each interior angle can be calculated using the formula ((n-2)*180)/n. So plugging in 8, it's (6*180)/8 = 1080/8 = 135. Yep, that's the same as before.

I think that's correct. So the answer should be H:135.
