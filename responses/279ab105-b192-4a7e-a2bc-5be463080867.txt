Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the media-themes model of media influence. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

First, I remember that the media-themes model is one of several theories explaining how media affects audiences. Other models include the hypodermic needle model, which is more about direct influence, and the uses and gratifications theory, which talks about audiences seeking media for their needs.

The question is asking what the media-themes model claims. Let me look at the options one by one.

Option A says audiences are only influenced if they actively seek the message. That sounds a bit like the uses and gratifications model, where people are active in choosing what to watch or read. But I'm not sure if that's exactly the media-themes model.

Option B claims media only influences those already predisposed to agree. That might relate to the idea of selective exposure or selective perception, where people are more likely to accept messages that align with their existing beliefs. But is that the media-themes model specifically?

Option C: audiences reject messages conflicting with their beliefs. Again, that's more about selective processes, perhaps part of the selective exposure or cognitive dissonance theories. Not sure if it's the media-themes model.

Option D: audiences selectively interpret what they want to hear. Selective interpretation sounds like part of how people process media, maybe fitting into the media-themes model where themes are interpreted based on their own schemas or beliefs.

Option E: messages are universally interpreted the same way. That seems unlikely because different people have different backgrounds, so interpretations can vary. So E is probably incorrect.

Option F: media influence is only significant during major events. I don't think the media-themes model is event-specific. It's more about ongoing themes and how they're interpreted.

Option G: content analysis is the best way to identify themes. Wait, content analysis is a method to study media, not necessarily the model's claim about influence. So G might be more about research methods than the model itself.

Option H: audiences passively absorb messages. That's more like the hypodermic needle model, where media directly affects without the audience's active involvement. So H is probably not the answer.

Option I: media has no influence. That's contrary to most media influence theories, so I think I is incorrect.

Option J: social interaction reinforces selected ideas. While social interaction does play a role in how media messages are interpreted, I'm not sure if that's the primary focus of the media-themes model.

Wait, the media-themes model focuses on how media present themes and how audiences interpret them based on their own experiences and beliefs. So it's about selective interpretation. So looking back, option D says audiences selectively interpret what they want to hear, which aligns with this idea. They don't passively take in messages but instead interpret them in ways that make sense to them, possibly reinforcing their existing beliefs.

So putting it all together, the answer should be D. The model suggests that audiences selectively interpret media messages, fitting them to their own understanding and pre-existing beliefs.

The media-themes model of media influence emphasizes that audiences do not passively absorb messages but instead actively interpret them based on their own experiences and beliefs. This selective interpretation aligns with the idea that individuals process information in ways that resonate with their existing schemas and values. Among the options provided, the best fit is that audiences selectively interpret what they want to hear, which reflects the model's focus on how themes are understood and reinforced through personal filters.

Answer: D
