Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about solubility products and figuring out when hydroxides precipitate. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

The question says that the solubility products (Ksp) of Fe(OH)₂ and Fe(OH)₃ are 10^-17 and 10^-38, respectively. The concentrations of Fe²+ and Fe³+ are each 10^-5 M. I need to find the pH at which each hydroxide just begins to precipitate. The options are from A to J, so I'll have to calculate for both hydroxides and see which option matches.

First, I remember that the solubility product Ksp is a measure of the solubility of a compound. For a hydroxide, the general dissolution reaction is something like Fe(OH)₂ ⇌ Fe²+ + 2OH⁻. Similarly, Fe(OH)₃ would dissociate into Fe³+ and 3 OH⁻ ions.

Wait, no, wait. Let me write the correct dissociation equations. Fe(OH)₂ would dissociate into Fe²+ and 2 OH⁻. So the Ksp for Fe(OH)₂ is [Fe²+][OH⁻]^2. Similarly, Fe(OH)₃ would dissociate into Fe³+ and 3 OH⁻, so Ksp is [Fe³+][OH⁻]^3.

Given that, I can set up equations for each hydroxide to find the [OH⁻] when precipitation starts, which is when the product [Fe²+][OH⁻]^2 equals Ksp for Fe(OH)₂, and [Fe³+][OH⁻]^3 equals Ksp for Fe(OH)₃.

The Fe²+ and Fe³+ concentrations are each 10^-5 M, so I can plug those into the equations.

Starting with Fe(OH)₂:

Ksp = [Fe²+][OH⁻]^2.

So 1e-17 = (1e-5) * [OH⁻]^2.

To find [OH⁻], I can rearrange the equation:

[OH⁻]^2 = (1e-17) / (1e-5) = 1e-12.

Taking the square root of both sides, [OH⁻] = sqrt(1e-12) = 1e-6 M.

Wait, that's 1e-6 M of OH⁻. Now, pH is related to [OH⁻] through the equation pH = 14 - pOH. Since pOH is -log10([OH⁻]), let's calculate that.

pOH = -log(1e-6) = 6. So pH = 14 - 6 = 8.

Wait, that would mean that Fe(OH)₂ starts to precipitate at pH 8. Hmm, but let me double-check the calculation. Wait, Ksp is 1e-17, and [Fe²+] is 1e-5. So [OH⁻]^2 = 1e-17 / 1e-5 = 1e-12. Square root is 1e-6, yeah.

So pH is 8 for Fe(OH)₂.

Now for Fe(OH)₃. Ksp is 1e-38.

So Ksp = [Fe³+][OH⁻]^3.

Plugging in [Fe³+] = 1e-5 M:

1e-38 = (1e-5) * [OH⁻]^3.

Rearranging, [OH⁻]^3 = 1e-38 / 1e-5 = 1e-33.

Taking the cube root of 1e-33. Let's see, 1e-33 is (1e-11)^3, because (1e-11)^3 = 1e-33. So [OH⁻] = 1e-11 M.

pOH = -log(1e-11) = 11. So pH = 14 - 11 = 3.

Wait, that's pH 3 for Fe(OH)₃. So Fe(OH)₂ precipitates at pH 8, and Fe(OH)₃ at pH 3.

Wait, but wait a second. That seems off because Fe(OH)₃ is much less soluble than Fe(OH)₂, as its Ksp is way smaller. So it should precipitate at a lower pH than Fe(OH)₂, which matches here because 3 is lower than 8.

Looking at the options, which one has Fe(OH)₂ at pH 8 and Fe(OH)₃ at pH 3? Let me check the options.

Looking through the options:

Option I: pH = 8 for Fe(OH)₂ and pH =3 for Fe(OH)₃. So that would be option I.

Wait, but I thought I saw another option. Let me double-check. Wait, the options are A to J.

Option I is: pH =8 for Fe(OH)₂ and pH=3 for Fe(OH)₃. So that's correct.

Wait, but I don't see option I matching exactly. Let me check the options again.

Wait, let me recheck the options. The user provided options A to J, with each option being two pH values.

Looking back, the options are:

A: pH4 and pH9

B: pH6 and pH11

C: pH12 and pH7

D: pH9 and pH4

E: pH10 and pH5

F: pH5 and pH10

G: pH14 and pH14

H: pH7 and pH2

I: pH8 and pH3

J: pH11 and pH6

Yes, option I is pH8 for Fe(OH)₂ and pH3 for Fe(OH)₃. So that's the correct answer.

Wait, but wait another thing. The Fe(OH)₂ starts precipitating at pH8, which is lower than the pH of Fe(OH)₃ at pH3. That doesn't make sense because Fe(OH)₂ is more soluble (higher Ksp) than Fe(OH)₃, so it should precipitate at a higher pH. Because if a compound has a higher Ksp, it's more soluble, meaning it will precipitate at a higher pH.

Wait, because Ksp depends on how much the ions can be in solution. So a higher Ksp means the compound is more soluble, so it will precipitate only when the solution is more concentrated in OH⁻, i.e., higher pH.

Wait, but in our calculation, Fe(OH)₂ precipitates at pH8, which is higher than Fe(OH)₃ at pH3. That makes sense because Fe(OH)₂ is more soluble, so it starts precipitating at a higher pH.

So the correct pH values are 8 for Fe(OH)₂ and 3 for Fe(OH)₃, which is option I.

The solubility products (Ksp) of Fe(OH)₂ and Fe(OH)₃ are given as \(10^{-17}\) and \(10^{-38}\), respectively. The concentrations of Fe²⁺ and Fe³⁺ are each \(10^{-5}\) M. To determine the pH at which each hydroxide begins to precipitate, we use the Ksp expressions:

For Fe(OH)₂:  
\[
\text{Ksp} = [\text{Fe}^{2+}][\text{OH}^-]^2
\]  
Substituting \(10^{-17} = (10^{-5})[\text{OH}^-]^2\):  
\[
[\text{OH}^-]^2 = \frac{10^{-17}}{10^{-5}} = 10^{-12}
\]  
\[
[\text{OH}^-] = \sqrt{10^{-12}} = 10^{-6} \, \text{M}
\]  
The pOH is \(-\log(10^{-6}) = 6\), so the pH is \(14 - 6 = 8\).

For Fe(OH)₃:  
\[
\text{Ksp} = [\text{Fe}^{3+}][\text{OH}^-]^3
\]  
Substituting \(10^{-38} = (10^{-5})[\text{OH}^-]^3\):  
\[
[\text{OH}^-]^3 = \frac{10^{-38}}{10^{-5}} = 10^{-33}
\]  
\[
[\text{OH}^-] = \sqrt[3]{10^{-33}} = 10^{-11} \, \text{M}
\]  
The pOH is \(-\log(10^{-11}) = 11\), so the pH is \(14 - 11 = 3\).

Thus, Fe(OH)₂ begins to precipitate at pH 8, and Fe(OH)₃ begins to precipitate at pH 3. The correct option is:

I: pH = 8 for Fe(OH)₂ and pH = 3 for Fe(OH)₃.
