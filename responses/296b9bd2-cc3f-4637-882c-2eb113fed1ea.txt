Okay, so I've got this economics question here, and I need to figure out the answer. Let's see what it's about. The question is about the impact of government spending and tax changes on real GDP. Hmm, I remember from my studies that government spending and taxation can affect the economy in different ways.

Alright, the question says that the government of country Z increases spending by $12 million and raises tax collections by the same amount. I need to determine the overall impact on real GDP. The options are A through J, each giving a different outcome.

Wait, so the government is both spending more and taxing more. Let me think about how each of these actions affects the economy. I remember that government spending is part of the aggregate demand, which can stimulate economic activity. When the government spends more, it can lead to an increase in GDP because that spending goes into the economy, creating jobs and income for people, which then leads to more consumption.

On the other hand, when the government raises taxes, it takes more money out of the economy. Higher taxes mean that people have less disposable income, so they spend less. This can reduce consumption and thus lower aggregate demand. So, higher taxes tend to decrease GDP.

But wait, the question is about both actions happening at the same time—spending up by $12 million and taxes up by $12 million. So, what's the net effect? I think the key here is to look at the overall impact of these two policies together.

I remember something about a balanced budget multiplier. Oh right, the balanced budget theorem. If the government increases spending and taxes by the same amount, the overall effect on real GDP depends on the multiplier effect. Because when the government spends more, it directly increases demand. But when it taxes more, it reduces the private sector's disposable income, which might reduce their spending.

But wait, the net effect—if they're balanced—what happens? I think the balanced budget multiplier in a Keynesian model is 1, meaning that the overall effect on real GDP is zero because the increase in government spending is exactly offset by the decrease in consumption due to higher taxes. So, the real GDP remains unchanged.

Let me make sure I'm not mixing things up. If the government only increases spending, GDP would increase. If only taxes go up, GDP would decrease. But when both happen equally, do they cancel each other out? Yeah, I think that's right. So the overall impact is no change in real GDP. Therefore, the answer should be F: Real GDP will remain unchanged.

Wait, but some might think about the size of the multiplier. Oh, right, the spending multiplier is usually greater than 1, but the tax multiplier is less than 1. Wait, no—actually, in a balanced budget, the two changes exactly offset each other because the increase in G and the decrease in T (with same amount) leads to a net change in aggregate demand of zero. So, the overall effect is zero, meaning GDP doesn't change.

So, the correct answer is F. Let me check the options again. Option F is "Real GDP will remain unchanged." Yep, that's it.

The government's simultaneous increase in spending and taxes by $12 million each results in no net change to real GDP due to the balanced budget multiplier effect. Therefore, the correct answer is:

F: Real GDP will remain unchanged.

Answer: F
