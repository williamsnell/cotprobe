Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a particle in a one-dimensional box. Hmm, I remember that particles in a box problems are part of quantum mechanics, specifically dealing with the energy levels of a particle confined in a region. Let me try to break this down.

The question says that an electron in an excited energy level transitions to the ground state and emits a photon with a wavelength of 8.79 nm. I need to find the initial quantum number. The options given are A through J, with numbers like 10, 2, 3, etc. The box length is 2.00 Ångströms, which is 2.00 x 10^-10 meters. Wait, no, wait—Wait, 1 Å is 1e-10 meters, so 2.00 Å is 2e-10 m? Or wait, no, wait: 1 Å is 1e-10 meters, so 2.00 Å is 2.00 x 1e-10 m, which is 2e-10 m. Or wait, maybe I should double-check the units. No, wait, I think the box length is given as 2.00 Å, which is 2.00 x 10^-10 meters. So L=2.00e-10 m.

The photon emitted has a wavelength of 8.79 nm. Oh, nm is nanometers, so 1e-9 meters. So 8.79 nm is 8.79e-9 meters. I think the energy of the photon is related to the energy difference between the two states.

In a one-dimensional box, the energy levels are given by the formula E_n = (n² h²) / (8 m L²), where h is Planck's constant, m is the mass of the electron, and L is the length of the box. So the energy difference between the initial state (n_initial) and the ground state (n=1) is ΔE = E_n - E_1.

But wait, since the electron is transitioning from a higher energy level to a lower one, the photon's energy would be the difference between these two. So the energy of the photon (E_photon) equals ΔE. And since E_photon is hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant, c is the speed of light, and λ is the wavelength.

So putting it all together, the energy difference ΔE is E_n - E_1 = (n² - 1) * (h²)/(8 m L²). That should equal hc/λ.

Wait, so let me write the equations. The energy levels are E_n = (n² h²) / (8 m L²). So the energy difference when transitioning from n to 1 is E_n - E_1 = (n² - 1) * (h²)/(8 m L²).

This equals the photon's energy, which is E_photon = hc/λ.

So setting them equal: (n² - 1) * (h²)/(8 m L²) = hc/λ.

Hmm, I can solve for n from this equation. Let me rearrange it.

Multiply both sides by 8 m L² / h²:

(n² - 1) = (8 m L² c) / (h λ) * (1/h²?) Wait, no, let's see.

Wait, let me write the equation again:

ΔE = (n² -1) * (h²)/(8 m L²) = hc/λ

So, (n² - 1) = (8 m L² c) / (h λ) * (1/h²) ? Wait, no, let me do it step by step.

Wait, ΔE = (n² -1) * (h²)/(8 m L²) = hc/λ.

So, (n² - 1) = [ (8 m L² c) / (h λ) ) ] * (1/h²?) Wait, no, let me rearrange.

Let me write it as (n² -1) = [ (8 m L² c) / (h λ) ) ] * (1/(h²)) )? No, I think I'm getting confused here. Let's multiply both sides by (8 m L²)/(h²) to get (n² -1) = [ (8 m L² c) / (h λ) ) ].

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to plug in the numbers and see. Let me think about the constants:

h is Planck's constant, approximately 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s.

m is the mass of the electron, about 9.109 x 10^-31 kg.

c is the speed of light, 3.00 x 10^8 m/s.

L is 2.00 Å = 2.00e-10 m.

λ is 8.79e-9 m.

Let me compute the right-hand side: (8 m L² c) / (h λ).

Wait, but wait, let me compute (8 m L² c) / (h λ):

Let's plug in the numbers:

8 * m = 8 * 9.109e-31 kg ≈ 7.287e-30 kg.

L squared is (2.00e-10 m)^2 = 4.00e-20 m².

Multiply by c: 4.00e-20 m² * 3.00e8 m/s = 1.2e-11 m³/s.

Wait, no, wait: 8 m L² c = 8 * 9.109e-31 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 * 3e8 m/s.

Let me compute each term step by step.

Compute 8 * m: 8 * 9.109e-31 = 7.2872e-30 kg.

Compute L^2: (2e-10 m)^2 = 4e-20 m².

Multiply by c: 4e-20 m² * 3e8 m/s = 1.2e-11 m³/s.

Now multiply by 8 m L² c: 7.2872e-30 kg * 1.2e-11 m³/s = 8.7446e-41 kg·m³/s.

Wait, no, wait: Wait, perhaps I should compute 8 m L² c as:

8 * m * L^2 * c.

m=9.109e-31 kg.

L=2e-10 m, so L^2=(2e-10)^2=4e-20 m².

c=3e8 m/s.

So 8 * m = 8 * 9.109e-31 = 7.2872e-30 kg.

Multiply by L^2: 7.2872e-30 kg * 4e-20 m² = 2.91488e-49 kg·m².

Multiply by c: 2.91488e-49 kg·m² * 3e8 m/s = 8.74464e-41 kg·m³/s.

So numerator is 8 m L² c = 8.74464e-41 kg·m³/s.

Denominator is h * λ.

h=6.626e-34 J·s.

λ=8.79e-9 m.

So h * λ = 6.626e-34 * 8.79e-9 = let's compute that.

6.626e-34 * 8.79e-9 = 6.626 *8.79 = approx 58.23, so 58.23e-43 = 5.823e-42 J·m.

Wait, 6.626 * 8.79: 6 *8 is 48, 6*0.79 is about 4.74; 0.626 *8 is 5.008, and 0.626 *0.79 is about 0.493. So adding up: 48 +4.74 +5.008 +0.493 ≈ 58.241. So 58.241e-43, which is 5.8241e-42.

So denominator hλ = 5.8241e-42 J·m.

So (8 m L² c)/(h λ) = 8.74464e-41 / 5.8241e-42 ≈ (8.74464 / 5.8241) * (1e-41 /1e-42) ) = approx 1.5016 * 10 ≈ 15.016.

Wait, let me compute that division more accurately.

8.74464e-41 / 5.8241e-42 = (8.74464 / 5.8241) * (1e-41 /1e-42) )

1e-41 /1e-42 = 10.

So 8.74464 /5.8241 is approximately 1.5016.

So 1.5016 *10 =15.016.

So (8 m L² c)/(h λ) ) ≈15.016.

So n² -1 = 15.016.

So n² = 15.016 +1 =16.016.

So n ≈ sqrt(16.016) ≈4.002. Hmm, that's about 4. So n is 4.

Wait, looking at the options, D is 4. So the initial state is n=4, since it's dropping to n=1. So the initial quantum number is 4.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation because I'm approximating a lot. Let me make sure.

Computing (8 m L² c)/(h λ):

m=9.109e-31 kg.

L=2e-10 m.

c=3e8 m/s.

h=6.626e-34 J·s.

λ=8.79e-9 m.

Compute each part:

8 * m = 8 *9.109e-31 =7.2872e-30 kg.

L² = (2e-10)^2 =4e-20 m².

Multiply by c: 4e-20 *3e8 =1.2e-11 m²/s.

Now, 8 m L² c =7.2872e-30 *1.2e-11 =8.7446e-41 kg·m²/s.

h λ =6.626e-34 *8.79e-9 = let's compute that more precisely.

6.626e-34 *8.79e-9 =6.626 *8.79 = let me calculate that: 6*8=48, 6*0.79=4.74, 0.626*8=5.008, 0.626*0.79≈0.493. So total is 48 +4.74 +5.008 +0.493 =58.241. So 58.241e-43 =5.8241e-42 J·m.

So (8 m L² c)/(h λ) =8.7446e-41 /5.8241e-42 ≈ (8.7446 /5.8241) *10 ≈1.5016 *10=15.016.

So n²-1 =15.016 → n²=16.016 → n≈4.002. So n is about 4.

So the initial state is n=4, so the quantum number is 4. Looking at the options, D is 4. So the answer should be D.

To solve the problem, we analyze the energy levels of a particle in a one-dimensional box. The energy levels are given by:

\[
E_n = \frac{n^2 h^2}{8 m L^2}
\]

where \( n \) is the quantum number, \( h \) is Planck's constant, \( m \) is the mass of the electron, and \( L \) is the length of the box. When the electron transitions from an excited state (\( n_{\text{initial}} \)) to the ground state (\( n = 1 \)), the energy difference is:

\[
\Delta E = E_{n_{\text{initial}}} - E_1 = \frac{(n_{\text{initial}}^2 - 1) h^2}{8 m L^2}
\]

This energy difference corresponds to the photon emitted, whose energy is:

\[
E_{\text{photon}} = \frac{hc}{\lambda}
\]

Equating the two expressions for energy:

\[
\frac{(n_{\text{initial}}^2 - 1) h^2}{8 m L^2} = \frac{hc}{\lambda}
\]

Rearranging for \( n_{\text{initial}}^2 - 1 \):

\[
n_{\text{initial}}^2 - 1 = \frac{8 m L^2 c}{h \lambda}
\]

Substituting the given values:
- \( L = 2.00 \, \text{Å} = 2.00 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \)
- \( \lambda = 8.79 \, \text{nm} = 8.79 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m} \)
- \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \)
- \( m = 9.109 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg} \)
- \( c = 3.00 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \)

First, compute \( 8 m L^2 c \):

\[
8 m L^2 c = 8 \times (9.109 \times 10^{-31}) \times (2.00 \times 10^{-10})^2 \times (3.00 \times 10^8)
\]

\[
8 m L^2 c = 8.7446 \times 10^{-41} \, \text{kg·m}^3/\text{s}
\]

Next, compute \( h \lambda \):

\[
h \lambda = (6.626 \times 10^{-34}) \times (8.79 \times 10^{-9}) = 5.8241 \times 10^{-42} \, \text{J·m}
\]

Now, calculate \( \frac{8 m L^2 c}{h \lambda} \):

\[
\frac{8 m L^2 c}{h \lambda} = \frac{8.7446 \times 10^{-41}}{5.8241 \times 10^{-42}} \approx 15.016
\]

Thus:

\[
n_{\text{initial}}^2 - 1 = 15.016 \quad \Rightarrow \quad n_{\text{initial}}^2 = 16.016 \quad \Rightarrow \quad n_{\text{initial}} \approx 4.002
\]

Since \( n \) must be an integer, \( n_{\text{initial}} = 4 \). Therefore, the quantum number of the initial state is **4**, which corresponds to option **D**.
