Question:

E: 6.3molal
F: 4.0 molal
G: 3.2 molal
H: 7.2molal
I: 7.8 molal
J: 9.6 molal

Okay, so I've got this problem here about calculating the molality of an alcohol-water mixture that won't freeze above -10°C. Hmm, freezing point depression, right? I remember from chemistry that adding solutes lowers the freezing point of a solution compared to the pure solvent. 

The question gives me the freezing point constant, Kf, which is 1.86°C·kg/mol. The molecular weight of the alcohol is 46 g/mol. Wait, but for molality, I don't think I need the molecular weight because molality is moles per kilogram of solvent. Oh, right, because it's based on the number of particles in the solution. 

The formula I think I need is ΔTf = Kf * m * i, where ΔTf is the change in freezing point, Kf is the freezing point depression constant, m is molality, and i is the van't Hoff factor, which is the number of particles the solute dissociates into. 

Since alcohol is probably a nonelectrolyte, like ethanol or something similar, it should dissociate into two particles? Wait, no, no. Wait, ethanol is C2H5OH, which doesn't dissociate in water. So i would be 1, right? Because it doesn't split into ions. So i=1.

The freezing point of pure water is 0°C. We want the solution to freeze at -10°C. So the change in freezing point ΔTf would be 10°C (since 0 - (-10) = 10). Wait, actually, the formula is ΔTf = Kf * m * i, and since the freezing point is lower, ΔTf is positive 10°C.

So plugging in the numbers: 10 = 1.86 * m * 1. So m = 10 / 1.86. Let me calculate that. 

10 divided by 1.86. Hmm, 1.86 times 5 is 9.3, and 1.86 *5.4 would be around 10. So 5.4 molal. Let me check the calculation again. 1.86 *5.4 equals 1.86 *5=9.3, plus 1.86*0.4=0.744. So 9.3+0.744=10.044, which is about 10. So m is approximately 5.4 molal.

Looking at the options, option A is 5.4 molal. So that should be the answer.

The problem involves calculating the molality of an alcohol-water mixture that does not freeze above -10°C. Using the freezing point depression formula, ΔTf = Kf * m * i, where ΔTf is 10°C, Kf is 1.86°C·kg/mol, and i is 1 (since alcohol does not dissociate), the molality m is found to be approximately 5.4 molal.
