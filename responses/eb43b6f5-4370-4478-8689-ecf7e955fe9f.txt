Okay, so I've got this question about proprioceptive nerve endings in synovial joints. Hmm, I remember from my anatomy class that proprioception has to do with the sense of position and movement of the body. So the question is asking where these nerve endings are located.

Let me think. Synovial joints are the most common type of joints in the body, like the ones in our knees, elbows, etc. These joints have several structures: the articular cartilage covers the ends of the bones, the synovial membrane lines the joint capsule and secretes synovial fluid, which lubricates the joint. There are also ligaments that hold the joint together and stabilize it.

Now, proprioceptive nerves, or mechanoreceptors, are responsible for detecting changes in joint position and movement. I think they are located in certain areas of the joint. I remember something about the joint capsule being a key area. The capsule itself is made of connective tissue, and it has two layers: the outer fibrous layer and the inner synovial layer. The fibrous layer is dense connective tissue, and I believe that the nerves are found in this part because it's more substantial and has more connective tissue for the sensory organs to attach.

Wait, but also, I think there are some receptors in the ligaments. Ligaments are tough bands of connective tissue that connect bones to each other. So ligaments would also contain these nerve endings because they are important for stabilizing the joint and providing feedback on the position of the joint.

So putting that together, the proprioceptive nerve endings are located in both the capsule and the ligaments. Let me check the options. Option B is capsule and ligaments. Option J is synovial membrane and ligaments. Hmm, the synovial membrane is the inner layer, which is more about secreting fluid than housing nerve endings. The capsule's fibrous layer is where the receptors are, not the synovial membrane. So the correct answer must be B, which includes the capsule and ligaments.

Wait, another thought: sometimes I've heard that the articular cartilage doesn't have a lot of blood supply, so maybe not the best place for nerves. Yeah, I think the cartilage is more about reducing friction. So that supports the idea that the receptors are in the capsule and ligaments.

Also, I remember that the joint capsule has a lot of sensory receptors, especially in the fibrous part. So the answer must include the capsule. Among the options, B and J have the capsule and ligaments, but J pairs ligaments with synovial membrane, which I don't think is correct.

The proprioceptive nerve endings in synovial joints are primarily located in the joint capsule and ligaments. The joint capsule, particularly its fibrous layer, contains these sensory receptors, which are crucial for detecting joint position and movement. Ligaments, which stabilize the joint, also house these nerve endings to provide feedback on joint stability and position. Therefore, the correct answer is:

B: capsule and ligaments.

Answer: B
