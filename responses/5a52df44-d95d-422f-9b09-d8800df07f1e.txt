Alright, let's try to tackle this logic problem. Okay, so the question is about symbolizing a sentence in propositional logic. The sentence is: "A person is considered to have lived with you for all of the present year if the person was born or died in the present year and your home was this person's home for the entire time this person was alive."

First, I need to break this down. The main idea is that someone has lived with you all year (let's call this L) under two conditions: they were born or died this year (B or D), and your home was their home during their entire life (H). So, the structure seems to be that L happens if both B or D and H are true.

Let me assign some variables to make it clearer. Let's say:
- L: The person lived with you all year.
- B: The person was born this year.
- D: The person died this year.
- H: Your home was their home for the entire time they were alive.

The sentence is saying that if (B or D) and H are true, then L is true. So in logical terms, that would be (B ∨ D) and H implying L. Wait, no, actually, the sentence says that a person is considered to have lived with you all year (L) if both (B or D) and H are true. So it's more like (B ∨ D) ∧ H → L.

Wait, but looking at the options, I need to see which one matches this structure. Let me look at each option.

Option A: H ⊃ [(B ∨ D) • L]. So H implies (B or D) and L. That doesn't seem right because the original condition is that both B/D and H together imply L. So H alone wouldn't be sufficient; both B/D and H are needed.

Option B: (L ∨ B) • (D ⊃ H). This seems a bit off. It's saying (L or B) and (if D then H). Doesn't match the structure we're looking for.

Option C: [L ⊃ (B ∨ D)] • H. So if L then (B or D), and H. Doesn't fit because the original is about (B/D and H) implying L.

Option D: (B ∨ D) ⊃ (H • L). Hmm, this says if (B or D) then (H and L). Wait, but the original says that if (B or D) and H, then L. So D is saying that B or D leads to both H and L, which might not be correct because H is a separate condition.

Option E: L ⊃ (B ∨ D • H). This looks like if L then (B or (D and H)), which isn't the same as the original condition.

Option F: [(B ∨ D) • H] ⊃ L. Wait, this is exactly what we're thinking! So if (B or D) and H, then L. So F seems correct.

Option G: L ⊃ [(B ∨ D) • H]. This is the converse of F. It says if L then (B or D) and H, which isn't what the original sentence states.

Option H: L ⊃ [(H • B) ∨ D]. Again, this is about L implying something else, not the condition for L.

Option I: [(B ∨ D) ∨ H] ⊃ L. This would mean if either B/D or H, then L, which is too broad because H alone isn't enough; both B/D and H are needed together.

Option J: (B ∨ D • H) ⊃ L. The parentheses here are confusing. It could be read as (B ∨ (D ∧ H)), which would mean if B or both D and H, then L. But the original requires both B/D and H together, not just one or the other.

So after analyzing, option F seems to correctly capture the structure: (B ∨ D) and H imply L.

The correct formula is F: [(B ∨ D) • H] ⊃ L.

Answer: F
