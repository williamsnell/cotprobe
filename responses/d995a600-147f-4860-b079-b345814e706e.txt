Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an electron being accelerated through a potential difference, and I need to find its final speed. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

Alright, the question says the electron is accelerated from rest through a potential difference of 100 kV. So, the potential difference Δφ is 100,000 volts. I remember that when a charge is accelerated through a potential difference, it gains kinetic energy. The energy gained should be equal to the charge multiplied by the potential difference.

Wait, the formula I think I need is the one relating electric potential energy to kinetic energy. So, the electric potential energy change is eΔφ, and that should equal the kinetic energy, which is (1/2)mv², right? Because the electron starts from rest, all the potential energy goes into kinetic.

So, the equation should be eΔφ = (1/2)mv². My goal is to find v, the speed.

I'll rearrange the equation to solve for v. Let's see. So, v² = (2eΔφ)/(m). Then, v is the square root of that.

Now, I need to plug in the values. Let's list out the constants I need:

- e is the elementary charge, which is 1.602 × 10^-19 coulombs.
- m is the mass of the electron, 9.109 × 10^-31 kilograms.
- Δφ is 100,000 volts, which is 1e5 volts.

Wait, actually, the potential difference is 100 kV, so that's 100,000 volts. So, eΔφ would be (1.602e-19 C) * (1e5 V). Let me calculate that first.

Calculating eΔφ: 1.602e-19 * 1e5 = 1.602e-14 J. Because 1 volt is 1 joule per coulomb, so volts times coulombs give joules.

So, the kinetic energy is 1.602e-14 J. Now, set that equal to (1/2)mv².

Plugging in m: 9.109e-31 kg.

So, 1.602e-14 = 0.5 * 9.109e-31 * v².

Let me compute the right side: 0.5 * 9.109e-31 = 4.5545e-31.

So, 1.602e-14 = 4.5545e-31 * v².

To find v², divide both sides by 4.5545e-31.

v² = (1.602e-14) / (4.5545e-31) = ?

Let me calculate that. 1.602 / 4.5545 is approximately 0.3514. Then, 1e-14 / 1e-31 is 1e17.

So, v² ≈ 0.3514e17 = 3.514e16.

Now, take the square root to find v. sqrt(3.514e16) = approximately sqrt(3.514) * 1e8.

What's sqrt(3.514)? Let me think, sqrt(3)=1.732, sqrt(4)=2, so sqrt(3.514) should be around 1.875. Let me check with calculator steps.

Wait, 1.875 squared is (1.875)^2 = (1.8)^2 + 2*1.8*0.075 + (0.075)^2 = 3.24 + 0.27 + 0.005625 ≈ 3.5156. Hmm, that's very close to 3.514. So, sqrt(3.514) ≈ 1.875.

So, v ≈ 1.875e8 m/s. Looking at the options, option H is 1.88e8 m/s, which matches closely.

Wait, let me double-check the calculation to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Wait, 1.602e-19 * 1e5 = 1.602e-14 J, correct. Then, 1.602e-14 = 0.5 * 9.109e-31 * v².

So, v² = (2 * 1.602e-14) / (9.109e-31).

Wait, perhaps I missed the 2 in the earlier steps. Oh wait, no, the equation was v² = (2eΔφ)/(m), which I did. So, 2*1.602e-14 is 3.204e-14, divided by 9.109e-31 kg.

3.204e-14 / 9.109e-31 = (3.204 / 9.109) * 1e17.

3.204 /9.109 is approximately 0.3514, so 0.3514e17 = 3.514e16, same as before. So, sqrt(3.514e16) is sqrt(3.514)*1e8. As before, that's about 1.875e8 m/s.

So, the closest option is H: 1.88e8 m/s.

To determine the final speed of an electron accelerated through a potential difference of 100 kV, we use the conservation of energy. The potential energy gained, \( e\Delta\phi \), equals the kinetic energy, \( \frac{1}{2}mv^2 \). Rearranging for \( v \), we get:

\[
v = \sqrt{\frac{2e\Delta\phi}{m}}
\]

Substituting the constants:
- \( e = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \mathrm{C} \)
- \( m = 9.109 \times 10^{-31} \, \mathrm{kg} \)
- \( \Delta\phi = 100,000 \, \mathrm{V} \)

\[
v = \sqrt{\frac{2(1.602 \times 10^{-19})(100,000)}{9.109 \times 10^{-31}}}
\]

Calculating \( e\Delta\phi \) gives \( 1.602 \times 10^{-14} \, \mathrm{J} \). Substituting into the equation:

\[
v = \sqrt{\frac{2(1.602 \times 10^{-14})}{9.109 \times 10^{-31}}}
\]

Simplifying:

\[
v = \sqrt{3.514 \times 10^{16}} \approx 1.875 \times 10^8 \, \mathrm{m/s}
\]

The closest option is **H: 1.88 \( 10^8 \, \mathrm{m/s} \)**.
