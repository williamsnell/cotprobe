Question:

A father died leaving a will by which he devised a 100-acre tract to his daughter. At the time of the father's death, he believed that he owned all of the 100-acre tract. However, the father actually owned 95 acres of the tract. The other five acres were owned by a farmer. After taking possession of the tract, the daughter executed and delivered a warranty deed to a buyer, purporting to convey all 100 acres of the tract. The agreed purchase price was $100,000. According to the terms of the sale, the buyer paid the daughter a down payment of $25,000, with the unpaid portion of the purchase price (i. e. , $75,000) secured by a mortgage. The mortgage instrument described the property interest as covering all 100 acres of the tract. After the daughter buyer transaction was completed, the farmer came forward and informed the parties that she was the true record owner of five acres of the 100-acre tract. Upon the farmer's threat to sue to quiet title, the daughter negotiated a deal whereby she paid the farmer $5,000 for the five-acre tract. As part of their agreement, the farmer executed and delivered a quitclaim deed quitclaiming to the buyer all of her interest in the five-acre parcel. Thereafter, the buyer defaulted on the mortgage debt, and the daughter properly consummated foreclosure proceedings, becoming the purchaser of the tract at her own foreclosure sale. The description of the deed in the foreclosure sale referred to the tract as consisting of all 100 acres. After the foreclosure sale was finalized, the buyer brought suit claiming title in fee simple to the five-acre tract, formerly owned by the farmer. In an appropriate action to determine the title to the said five-acre tract, the buyer will

Options:

A: lose, because the buyer did not have a legal claim to the five-acre tract
B: lose, because the foreclosure proceedings were properly executed
C: win, because the farmer's threat to sue to quiet title was not legally binding
D: win, because the deed from the farmer to the buyer was a quitclaim deed.
E: win, because the quitclaim deed from the farmer to the buyer was subsequent to the deed from the daughter to the buyer and to the mortgage.
F: lose, because the buyer defaulted on the mortgage debt
G: win, because the daughter purchased the tract at her own foreclosure sale
H: lose, because the doctrine of after-acquired title controls.
I: win, because the mortgage instrument described the property interest as covering all 100 acres of the tract.

Okay, let's try to work through this legal problem. Hmm, it's about property law, specifically regarding deeds and ownership. The situation is a bit complex, but I'll break it down step by step.

So, the father left a will devising a 100-acre tract to his daughter. At the time of his death, he thought he owned all 100 acres, but actually, he only owned 95 acres. The other 5 acres were owned by a farmer. The daughter took possession of the tract, which I assume includes both the 95 acres she inherited and the 5 acres from the farmer. Then, she executed a warranty deed to a buyer, conveying all 100 acres. The purchase price was $100,000, with a $25,000 down payment and a $75,000 mortgage.

The mortgage instrument covered all 100 acres. So the buyer paid the down payment and took possession, but the daughter still had a mortgage on the property. Then, the farmer came forward, claiming she was the true owner of the 5 acres. She threatened to sue to quiet title, so the daughter negotiated and paid her $5,000 for the 5-acre tract. As part of this, the farmer delivered a quitclaim deed to the buyer, transferring her interest in those 5 acres.

After that, the buyer defaulted on the mortgage, and the daughter foreclosed. She became the purchaser at her own foreclosure sale, and the deed there described the tract as 100 acres. Now, the buyer is suing, claiming title in fee simple to the five-acre tract.

The question is about who owns the five acres now. The options are A through I, each giving a reason.

First, I need to understand the chain of title and the types of deeds involved. The daughter initially owned 95 acres, not 100. She conveyed all 100 acres via a warranty deed to the buyer. Then, when the farmer claimed the 5 acres, the daughter bought it from her, and the farmer gave a quitclaim deed to the buyer.

Wait, no. Let me re-read. The daughter paid the farmer $5,000, and as part of their agreement, the farmer executed a quitclaim deed to the buyer. So the farmer transferred her interest to the buyer, not to the daughter. Hmm, that's a bit confusing.

Wait, the daughter wanted to clear up the title, so she bought the 5 acres from the farmer and got a quitclaim deed. But the deed was from the farmer to the buyer, not to the daughter. So the farmer's deed went directly to the buyer, not the daughter. That might be important.

So, the daughter had the 95 acres from her father's will. She conveyed all 100 acres to the buyer via warranty deed. But she only owned 95, so she was conveying 5 acres that she didn't own. That makes her deed to the buyer a conveyance that included 5 acres she didn't have title to, which could be a problem.

The farmer later conveyed her 5 acres to the buyer via a quitclaim deed. So the buyer now has two interests: one from the daughter (warranty deed for 100 acres) and one from the farmer (quitclaim for 5 acres).

But wait, the daughter had to foreclose because the buyer defaulted. After foreclosure, the daughter took ownership again. So she sold the property at foreclosure, but the description was 100 acres. Then the buyer is suing, claiming he owns the five acres.

Let's think about ownership. The daughter's initial conveyance to the buyer via warranty deed was only valid for the 95 acres she owned. The 5 acres were owned by the farmer. So when the buyer purchased from the daughter, he had a claim to the 95 acres, but the 5 were not hers to convey. So the warranty deed's 100 acres included 5 she didn't own, making that part of the deed ineffective.

Then, the farmer conveyed her 5 acres to the buyer via a quitclaim deed. A quitclaim deed only transfers whatever interest the grantor has. Since the farmer owned the 5 acres, her quitclaim deed to the buyer would transfer that 5-acre interest to the buyer.

So, after the farmer's quitclaim deed, the buyer owns the 5 acres in fee simple from the farmer, and the 95 from the daughter. Then, the buyer defaulted, and the daughter foreclosed. But since the buyer had a mortgage on the entire 100 acres, including the 5, would the foreclosure affect that?

Wait, the daughter's mortgage was on the 100 acres, but she only owned 95. So when she foreclosed, she took the property back. But the buyer had obtained title to the 5 acres from the farmer. Does the foreclosure affect the buyer's ownership of the 5 acres?

In a foreclosure, the mortgagee (daughter) takes the property as it was at the time of the mortgage. If the mortgage included the 5 acres, but the daughter didn't have a valid interest in them, would the mortgage cover those 5? Or would the mortgage only apply to the 95 acres she owned.

This is getting a bit tangled. Let me think about the priority of interests. The buyer got a quitclaim deed from the farmer, which gave him the 5 acres. Then, the daughter conveyed the 100 acres to the buyer via warranty deed. But since the daughter didn't own the 5, that part was ineffective. However, the farmer's quitclaim to the buyer would give him the 5 acres.

But then, when the buyer took the mortgage, he mortgaged the 100 acres, which included the 5. So when he defaulted, the daughter foreclosed on the entire 100 acres. But the 5 acres were owned by the buyer via the quitclaim deed. So does the foreclosure extinguish the buyer's interest in the 5 acres?

Wait, no. Because the daughter only had a mortgage on the 100 acres, but she didn't own the 5. So when she foreclosed, she could only take the property she had an interest in, which was the 95 acres. The 5 acres, owned by the buyer, wouldn't be part of the foreclosure. Or would they?

Alternatively, perhaps the mortgage was on the buyer's interest. So when the buyer took the mortgage, he was mortgaging his interest. So if he owned the 5 acres, then the mortgage would include those. But if the daughter only had an interest in 95, then the mortgage on the 100 acres would include both her 95 and the buyer's 5.

But when the buyer defaulted, the daughter foreclosed and took the entire tract, which included both her 95 and the 5. But the 5 were owned by the buyer, not the daughter. So the daughter's foreclosure would only affect her 95 acres. The 5 acres would remain with the buyer, as the mortgage wouldn't affect them since they weren't part of her ownership.

Wait, but the buyer's mortgage was on the entire 100 acres. So when he took the mortgage, he mortgaged all his interest in the property. Since he had a 5 acres from the farmer, that was part of his interest. So when the daughter foreclosed, she took the entire tract, including the 5 acres, because the mortgage was on the entire 100 acres. But the problem is that the daughter didn't own the 5 acres, so could she even mortgage them?

This is getting complicated. Maybe I should think about the chain of title and who owns what at each step.

1. Father's will: daughter gets 95 acres. The other 5 belong to the farmer.

2. Daughter conveys all 100 acres via warranty deed to buyer. So for the 95 acres, she can convey that. The 5 she doesn't own, so that part is a flaw in the warranty deed. The buyer gets title to the 95 from the daughter, but the 5 are not hers to convey.

3. Farmer later conveys her 5 acres to the buyer via quitclaim deed. So the buyer now has title to the 5 acres from the farmer.

4. Buyer takes a mortgage on the entire 100 acres. The mortgage would encumber all the buyer's interest, including the 5 acres from the farmer.

5. Buyer defaults. Daughter forecloses on the mortgage. The foreclosure sale includes the entire 100 acres. But the daughter only owned the 95 acres; the 5 were owned by the buyer.

Wait, but when the daughter foreclosed, she took the property as it was at the time of the mortgage. The buyer owned the 5 acres, so the mortgage would have included those. Therefore, in the foreclosure, the daughter took the entire 100 acres, including the 5. But the problem is that the daughter didn't have a valid title to the 5 acres to begin with. So when she conveyed them to the buyer via warranty deed, she was only conveying her 95. The 5 were a separate conveyance from the farmer.

So after the foreclosure, the daughter owns the 95 acres from her will, plus the 5 acres because the buyer's interest was extinguished through foreclosure. But wait, no. The buyer had a quitclaim deed from the farmer, giving him the 5 acres. The mortgage was on his entire interest, so when he defaulted, the daughter could foreclose and take the entire property, including the 5 acres.

But the daughter's initial conveyance to the buyer was only valid for the 95 acres. So the buyer's ownership of the 5 acres came from the farmer, not the daughter. Therefore, when the daughter foreclosed, she took the 95 acres (her own) plus the 5 acres (from the buyer's mortgage). So after foreclosure, the daughter owns all 100 acres.

But the buyer is suing, claiming he owns the five-acre tract. So who is right?

Alternatively, perhaps the quitclaim deed from the farmer to the buyer conveyed the 5 acres to the buyer, making him the owner. Then, when the buyer mortgaged the entire 100 acres, that included the 5. So when the buyer defaulted, the daughter foreclosed, and the property sold at foreclosure included the 5 acres. Therefore, the daughter now owns the 5 acres as part of the foreclosure.

Wait, but the daughter didn't have any interest in the 5 acres before the foreclosure. So could she take them through foreclosure?

This is tricky. Let me think about the mortgage. The buyer had a mortgage on the entire 100 acres, which he received from the daughter's warranty deed and the farmer's quitclaim deed. So the mortgage would encumber both the 95 acres from the daughter and the 5 from the farmer. Therefore, when the buyer defaulted, the daughter could foreclose on the entire property, including the 5 acres.

So after foreclosure, the daughter would own all 100 acres, including the 5. Therefore, the buyer no longer has any interest in the 5 acres because the foreclosure sale transferred the entire property to the daughter.

But wait, the daughter's warranty deed to the buyer only covered the 95 acres she owned. The 5 acres were from the farmer. So when the buyer received the quitclaim from the farmer, he owned the 5. The mortgage was on all 100, so when he defaulted, the daughter foreclosed and took the entire tract, including the 5.

Thus, after foreclosure, the daughter owns the 100 acres, including the 5. Therefore, the buyer has no claim to the 5 acres anymore.

But the options don't directly state this. Let's look at the options:

Option A: lose, because the buyer did not have a legal claim to the five-acre tract.

But the buyer did have a legal claim because he received a quitclaim deed from the farmer. So he owned the 5 acres before foreclosure. But after foreclosure, the daughter took the entire tract, including the 5.

So the buyer's ownership was extinguished upon foreclosure because the mortgage was on the entire property. Therefore, the buyer no longer has a claim.

Alternatively, the buyer's ownership was subject to the mortgage, so the foreclosure would transfer the 5 acres to the daughter.

So the buyer would lose because the daughter's foreclosure sale included the 5 acres.

Looking at the options:

Option A says the buyer didn't have a legal claim. But he did have a claim before foreclosure. However, after foreclosure, his claim is extinguished.

Option H: lose, because the doctrine of after-acquired title controls.

After-acquired title refers to when someone acquires title after a conveyance. For example, if A conveys land to B but A didn't own it, and later A acquires it, the title passes to B retroactively. That's after-acquired title.

In this case, the daughter initially didn't own the 5 acres, but later (after conveying the warranty deed to the buyer), she bought the 5 acres from the farmer and had the farmer convey it to the buyer via quitclaim. So the daughter's interest in the 5 acres came after she had already conveyed to the buyer. But the farmer's quitclaim was directly to the buyer, not to the daughter. So the daughter didn't acquire the 5 acres herself; the farmer conveyed them to the buyer.

Wait, the daughter paid the farmer $5,000 and the farmer executed a quitclaim deed to the buyer. So the farmer's deed was to the buyer, not the daughter. So the daughter didn't acquire the 5 acres; she just facilitated the transfer from the farmer to the buyer.

Therefore, the doctrine of after-acquired title might not apply here because the daughter didn't acquire the 5 acres after the conveyance to the buyer. The farmer did, conveying directly to the buyer.

So perhaps the correct reasoning is that the buyer's ownership of the 5 acres was subject to the mortgage, and upon foreclosure, the daughter took the entire tract, including the 5. Therefore, the buyer lost his interest.

Looking at the options, option A says the buyer loses because he didn't have a legal claim, but he did have a quitclaim deed. So A is incorrect.

Option E: win, because the quitclaim deed from the farmer to the buyer was subsequent to the deed from the daughter to the buyer and the mortgage.

Wait, the quitclaim was after the daughter's warranty deed, but the mortgage was taken after both. So the mortgage would have priority over the quitclaim deed if the mortgage was recorded first. But recording dates matter for priority.

But the key is that the mortgage was on the entire 100 acres, which included the 5 from the farmer. So when the buyer defaulted, the mortgagee (daughter) foreclosed and took the entire property, including the 5.

Therefore, the buyer's claim is extinguished by foreclosure.

Looking at the options, which one aligns with this?

Option A is incorrect because the buyer did have a claim (from the farmer's quitclaim) before foreclosure.

Option E suggests the buyer wins because the quitclaim was after the mortgage. But the mortgage would take priority over the quitclaim unless the quitclaim was recorded first. But recording is about notice, not priority. The priority is determined by the time of recording. If the daughter's mortgage was recorded before the farmer's quitclaim, then the mortgage would have priority, and the quitclaim would be subordinate. But if the quitclaim was recorded first, it would take priority.

In the problem, it's not stated when the deeds were recorded. Assuming they were both recorded, but the mortgage was taken after the quitclaim, so the mortgage would have priority because it was a later interest.

Wait, no. The mortgage was taken after the quitclaim. So the mortgage would have priority over the quitclaim if the mortgage was recorded first. Since the problem doesn't specify, but generally, the mortgage would have priority if recorded before the quitclaim.

But the key point is that the mortgage was on the entire 100 acres, which included the 5 from the farmer. Therefore, the foreclosure would affect the 5 acres as part of the mortgage.

So the buyer's interest in the 5 acres was subject to the mortgage, and upon foreclosure, the daughter took the entire tract, including the 5. Therefore, the buyer loses.

So looking at the options, option A says the buyer loses because he didn't have a legal claim. But he did have a claim via the quitclaim deed. So A is incorrect.

Option E says the buyer wins because the quitclaim was after the mortgage. But if the mortgage was recorded first, it has priority, so the quitclaim would not affect that.

Option H: lose, because the doctrine of after-acquired title controls. But I don't think that applies here since the daughter didn't acquire the 5 acres after conveying to the buyer. The farmer conveyed directly to the buyer.

Option B: lose, because the foreclosure was properly executed. That seems likely because the daughter took the entire tract, including the 5 acres, through foreclosure.

Alternatively, the daughter's ownership of the 95 acres was separate, and the 5 were the buyer's, but the mortgage included both. So upon foreclosure, the daughter took all 100, including the 5.

Therefore, the buyer's interest was extinguished, so he loses.

Looking for the option that says the buyer loses because the foreclosure was proper. That's option B: lose, because the foreclosure proceedings were properly executed.

But wait, earlier I thought the daughter only owned 95, so could she properly foreclose on the 100? Maybe not, because she didn't have a valid interest in the 5. So the mortgage might not have been enforceable against the 5 acres.

Wait, the daughter's mortgage was on the 100 acres, but she only owned 95. So the mortgage on the 5 acres would be invalid because she didn't own them. Therefore, the foreclosure could only affect the 95 acres she owned.

If that's the case, the 5 acres would remain with the buyer because the mortgage didn't cover them. Therefore, the buyer would still own the 5, and the daughter only owns the 95.

In that case, the buyer would win because the foreclosure didn't affect the 5 acres.

But this is conflicting. Let me think again.

The daughter's warranty deed to the buyer conveyed 100 acres, but she only owned 95. So the buyer's title from the daughter is only valid for 95. The 5 came from the farmer's quitclaim, so the buyer owns the 5 in fee simple. The mortgage was on all 100, but the daughter only had a mortgage on the 95 she owned. The 5 were owned by the buyer, so the mortgage didn't affect them.

Therefore, when the buyer defaulted, the daughter could only foreclose on the 95 acres. The 5 acres would remain with the buyer because the mortgage didn't cover them.

Thus, the buyer would still own the 5 acres, and the daughter would own the 95. Therefore, the buyer would win.

Looking at the options, option E says the buyer wins because the quitclaim was subsequent to the mortgage. But the priority would depend on recording dates. If the mortgage was recorded before the quitclaim, it would have priority. But if the quitclaim was recorded first, it would take priority.

In the problem, the daughter had the mortgage instrument, which described the property as all 100 acres. The farmer conveyed via quitclaim after the daughter's conveyance but before the mortgage? Or after?

Wait, the daughter conveyed the warranty deed to the buyer, then the farmer threatened to sue, so the daughter paid the farmer and got the quitclaim deed to the buyer. Then the buyer took the mortgage.

So the sequence is:

1. Daughter conveys warranty deed to buyer (100 acres, but only owns 95).

2. Farmer threatens to sue, so daughter pays farmer $5k and farmer gives quitclaim to buyer (so the quitclaim is from farmer to buyer, after the warranty deed).

3. Buyer takes mortgage on the 100 acres.

So the mortgage was after both conveyances. Therefore, the recording dates would matter. If the mortgage was recorded first, it would have priority. If the quitclaim was recorded first, it would have priority.

Assuming the quitclaim was recorded before the mortgage, the buyer's interest would take priority over the mortgage. Therefore, the mortgage would not affect the 5 acres, and the buyer would keep them.

But if the mortgage was recorded first, then the mortgage would have priority, and the foreclosure would extinguish the buyer's interest in the 5 acres.

The problem doesn't specify the recording dates, so we have to assume that the mortgage was properly recorded, which would take priority unless the quitclaim was recorded first.

In most states, the first to be recorded has priority. So if the mortgage was recorded after the quitclaim, the quitclaim would have priority. But if the mortgage was recorded first, it would have priority.

But the problem states that the daughter properly consummated foreclosure proceedings, becoming the purchaser at her own foreclosure sale. So the foreclosure sale included the 100 acres, which suggests that the mortgage was enforceable on the entire tract, including the 5 acres.

But the daughter didn't own the 5 acres, so could she enforce the mortgage on them? Or was the mortgage only on her 95 acres?

This is getting too complicated. Perhaps the correct answer is that the buyer loses because the foreclosure was properly executed, taking all 100 acres, including the 5. So option B.

Alternatively, the daughter's mortgage on the 100 acres could only be enforced on the 95 she owned, leaving the 5 to the buyer. So the buyer would win, but that's not one of the options directly.

Looking at the options, option E says the buyer wins because the quitclaim was subsequent to the mortgage. But if the mortgage was recorded first, the buyer would lose. If the quitclaim was recorded first, the buyer would win.

But the problem doesn't specify, so perhaps the answer is E, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the farmer executed a quitclaim to the buyer after the daughter's warranty deed. So the daughter's mortgage was after both. So the mortgage was the last to be recorded, if they were recorded. So the mortgage would have priority over the quitclaim because it was recorded later. Therefore, the mortgage would take precedence, and the foreclosure would extinguish the buyer's interest in the 5 acres.

Thus, the buyer loses because the foreclosure was properly executed, taking the entire tract, including the 5 acres. So the answer is B.

But wait, the daughter didn't own the 5 acres, so could she mortgage them? No, because she didn't own them. Therefore, the mortgage on the 5 acres was invalid, and the foreclosure couldn't affect them. So the buyer still owns the 5 acres.

In that case, the buyer would win because the mortgage didn't affect the 5 acres. So the answer would be E or another option.

I'm getting confused. Let me try to summarize:

- Daughter owns 95 acres, conveys 100 to buyer via warranty deed. Buyer gets 95 from daughter, but 5 from nowhere.

- Farmer conveys 5 to buyer via quitclaim. Now buyer owns 5.

- Buyer mortgages entire 100 acres (his 95 + the 5). So the mortgage is on both.

- Buyer defaults. Daughter forecloses, takes entire 100 acres.

But daughter only owned 95, so could she take the 5 through foreclosure? Or does the mortgage on the 5 (which the daughter didn't own) not affect it.

I think the mortgage on the 5 acres was invalid because the daughter didn't own them, so the foreclosure couldn't take the 5. Therefore, the buyer still owns the 5.

Thus, the buyer would win because the foreclosure didn't affect the 5 acres.

Looking at the options, option E says the buyer wins because the quitclaim was after the mortgage. But the priority depends on recording dates. If the mortgage was recorded first, it would have priority. If the quitclaim was recorded first, it would.

But the problem says the daughter properly consummated foreclosure, implying that she took all 100, including the 5. So perhaps the answer is B, the buyer loses because the foreclosure was proper.

Alternatively, if the mortgage couldn't affect the 5, the buyer would win. But I'm not certain.

I think the correct answer is E: win, because the quitclaim was subsequent to the mortgage. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, the answer is A: lose because he didn't have a claim, but he did have a quitclaim.

Wait, the daughter's warranty deed to the buyer only covered the 95. The 5 were obtained via the farmer's quitclaim after the mortgage. So the mortgage was on the 100, but the 5 were acquired after the mortgage. So the mortgage would have priority over the quitclaim if recorded first.

But if the quitclaim was recorded after the mortgage, the mortgage would take precedence.

In any case, the buyer's claim would depend on whether the mortgage affected the 5.

I think the correct answer is E: win, because the quitclaim was after the mortgage. But I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, the answer is A, but that doesn't seem right because he did have a claim via the quitclaim.

Wait, the daughter's deed to the buyer was a warranty deed for 100 acres, but she only owned 95. So the warranty deed was ineffective for the 5. Therefore, the buyer didn't get title to the 5 from the daughter. Instead, he got it from the farmer's quitclaim deed.

The mortgage was on the entire 100 acres, which included the 5. But since the daughter didn't own the 5, could she mortgage them? Or was the mortgage only on her 95?

I think the mortgage would only be enforceable on the 95 acres she owned. Therefore, the 5 were not part of the mortgage, and the buyer's ownership of them wasn't affected by the foreclosure.

Thus, the buyer would own the 5 acres, and the daughter owns the 95. So the buyer would win because the foreclosure didn't affect the 5.

Looking at the options, option E says the buyer wins because the quitclaim was after the mortgage. But the priority would depend on recording dates. If the mortgage was recorded first, it would have priority, but if the quitclaim was recorded first, it would.

Since the problem doesn't specify, I think the answer is E: win, because the quitclaim was subsequent to the mortgage. But I'm not entirely confident.

Alternatively, the answer could be A: lose, but that doesn't fit because he did have a claim.

I think I'll go with option E: the buyer wins because the quitclaim was subsequent to the mortgage.
</think>

The question revolves around property ownership and the effects of deeds and foreclosure. The daughter inherited 95 acres but conveyed all 100 acres to the buyer via a warranty deed. The farmer, owning the remaining 5 acres, later executed a quitclaim deed to the buyer. The buyer then mortgaged the entire 100 acres, including the 5 acres conveyed by the farmer, and defaulted on the mortgage. The daughter foreclosed and took possession of the entire tract, including the 5 acres.

The key issue is whether the buyer's ownership of the 5 acres was extinguished by the foreclosure. The daughter's warranty deed to the buyer was only valid for the 95 acres she owned, while the 5 acres were acquired by the buyer through the farmer's quitclaim deed. The mortgage on the entire 100 acres included the 5 acres, but since the daughter did not own them, the mortgage's validity over the 5 acres is questionable. However, the foreclosure likely extinguished the buyer's interest in the 5 acres as part of the mortgage process.

Option E suggests the buyer wins because the quitclaim deed was subsequent to the mortgage. However, the priority of interests depends on recording dates, which are not specified. If the mortgage was recorded first, it would have priority, and the buyer's interest would be extinguished. Given the problem's context, the foreclosure likely transferred the entire tract, including the 5 acres, to the daughter. Therefore, the buyer loses because the foreclosure was properly executed.
