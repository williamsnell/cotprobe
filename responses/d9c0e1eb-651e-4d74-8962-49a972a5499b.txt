Okay, so I've got this DNA question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

First, the problem says that a DNA molecule has 180 base pairs. Wait, DNA is made up of base pairs, right? Each base pair consists of two nucleotides, one from each strand. So the total number of nucleotides would be double that, but maybe I don't need that right now.

The question is asking how many cytosine nucleotides are present. Hmm. I remember that in DNA, the bases are adenine (A), thymine (T), cytosine (C), and guanine (G). And the pairing is A with T and C with G. So the number of A's equals the number of T's, and the number of C's equals the number of G's.

The problem states that the DNA is 20 percent adenine. So 20% of all the bases are adenine. Wait, but waitâ€”each base pair has two bases. So the total number of bases in the DNA molecule would be 180 base pairs multiplied by 2, which is 360 bases. Because each pair has two nucleotides, right?

So 20% of 360 bases are adenine. Let me calculate that. 20% is the same as 0.2, so 0.2 times 360 equals 72. So there are 72 adenine nucleotides.

Since in DNA, adenine pairs with thymine, the number of thymine nucleotides should be the same as adenine. So thymine is also 72.

Now, the total number of bases is 360, and we've accounted for 72 A and 72 T. That adds up to 144. So the remaining bases must be C and G. Because C pairs with G, their numbers should be equal. So the sum of C and G is 360 minus 144, which is 216. Since C equals G, each would be half of 216. So 216 divided by 2 is 108. So there are 108 cytosine nucleotides.

Wait, but wait another thing. Let me double-check. The DNA is a double helix, so each base pair has two nucleotides. So 180 base pairs mean 360 nucleotides in total.

20% of 360 is adenine, which is 72. So T is also 72. So C and G together make up 360 - 72 -72 = 216. Since C=G, each is 108. So the number of C nucleotides is 108. Looking at the options, option A is 108, so that's the answer.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't mix up the percentages. The problem says 20% adenine. So in the entire DNA, 20% are A's. So yes, 20% of 360 is 72. Then C is 108. So the correct answer should be A: 108.

The DNA molecule has 180 base pairs, meaning it contains 360 nucleotides. Since 20% of the nucleotides are adenine, there are 72 adenine nucleotides. Adenine pairs with thymine, so there are also 72 thymine nucleotides. The remaining 216 nucleotides are cytosine and guanine, which are equal in number. Dividing 216 by 2 gives 108 cytosine nucleotides.

Answer: A
