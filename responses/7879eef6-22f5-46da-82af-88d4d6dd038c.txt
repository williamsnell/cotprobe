Okay, so I've got this problem about finding the density of carbon monoxide under different conditions. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on gas laws, but I'll take it slow.

Alright, the problem says that at standard conditions, 28.0 grams of CO occupies 22.4 liters. I remember that standard conditions are usually 0°C and 1 atm pressure, which is about 760 mmHg or 760 torr. But wait, the question is asking about 20°C and 600 torr. So I need to adjust for these different conditions.

First, I think I should find the molar mass of CO because knowing that can help me find the number of moles, which is useful for gas calculations. Carbon has an atomic weight of about 12 g/mol, and oxygen is around 16 g/mol. So CO would be 12 + 16 = 28 g/mol. That makes sense because the problem gives us 28.0 grams, which is exactly one mole of CO. Oh wait, because 22.4 liters at standard conditions is one mole. So that checks out.

Now, the question is about finding the density at 20°C and 600 torr. Density is mass over volume, so I need to find the mass and the volume under these new conditions. But wait, the mass isn't changing because we're dealing with the same amount of substance, right? So the mass is still 28.0 grams, but the volume will change due to the different temperature and pressure.

I think I should use the combined gas law here. The formula is P1V1/T1 = P2V2/T2, where P is pressure, V is volume, and T is temperature in Kelvin. Because I'm looking for the new volume, I can rearrange the formula to solve for V2.

Let me jot down the given values:

P1 (initial pressure) is 760 torr (standard pressure).
V1 is 22.4 L (standard volume).
T1 is 0°C, which is 273.15 K.

P2 is 600 torr.
T2 is 20°C, which is 293.15 K.

So plugging into the formula: (760 torr)(22.4 L) / 273.15 K = (600 torr)(V2) / 293.15 K.

I can rearrange this to solve for V2: V2 = (760 * 22.4 * 293.15) / (600 * 273.15).

Let me compute that. First, let's calculate the numerator: 760 * 22.4 = let's see, 760 * 20 is 15,200 and 760 * 2.4 is 1,824, so total is about 17,024. Then multiply by 293.15. Hmm, that's a big number. Maybe I'll approximate.

Wait, maybe it's better to compute step by step. Let me compute 760 * 22.4 first. 22.4 * 700 is 15,680, and 22.4 * 60 is 1,344, so total is 17,024. Then 17,024 * 293.15. That's a bit too big. Alternatively, maybe I can simplify the fractions before multiplying.

Wait, maybe I can cancel some terms. Let me write the equation again:

V2 = (760 * 22.4 * 293.15) / (600 * 273.15)

I can simplify 760/600. Let's see, 760 ÷ 600 = 1.2667 (approx). Also, 293.15 / 273.15 is roughly 1.0733. So maybe I can multiply 22.4 by 1.2667 and 1.0733.

Wait, alternatively, maybe I can compute 760/600 as (760 ÷ 20)/(600 ÷20) = 38/30 = 19/15 ≈1.2667. And 293.15/273.15 is approximately 1.0733.

So V2 = 22.4 * (19/15) * (293.15/273.15).

Let me compute 19/15 first: that's about 1.2667.

Now, 22.4 * 1.2667 ≈ 22.4 * 1.2667 ≈ let's see, 22 * 1.2667 is about 27.867, and 0.4 *1.2667 is about 0.5067, so total is around 28.373 L.

Wait, maybe that's not the right way. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I can compute it as 22.4 * (760/600) * (293.15/273.15).

Let me compute each part step by step.

First, compute 760/600 = 1.26667.

Then, 293.15/273.15 ≈ 1.0732.

Multiply those two: 1.26667 * 1.0732 ≈ 1.3615.

Then, multiply by 22.4 L: 22.4 * 1.3615 ≈ 30.568 L.

Wait, that seems a bit high, but perhaps correct.

So V2 is approximately 30.568 liters.

But wait, let me check that calculation again because sometimes approximations can lead me astray.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

So, 760 * 22.4 = 17024.

17024 * 293.15 = let's compute that.

Well, 17024 * 293 = 17024 * (200 + 90 + 3) = 17024*200 = 3,404,800; 17024*90 = 1,532, 160; 17024*3=51,072. Adding them up: 3,404,800 + 1,532,160 = 4,936,960 +51,072=4,988,032.

Then, 17024 * 0.15 = 2,553.6, so total numerator is 4,988,032 + 2,553.6 = 4,990,585.6.

Denominator: 600 * 273.15 = 600*273=163,800; 600*0.15=90 → 163,890.

So V2 = 4,990,585.6 / 163,890 ≈ let's compute that.

Divide numerator and denominator by 100: 49,905.856 / 1,638.9.

Approximately, 49,905.856 ÷ 1,638.9 ≈ 30.44 liters.

Wait, that's about 30.44 L. Hmm, that's a bit more than my earlier approximation, but close enough.

So the volume at 20°C and 600 torr is approximately 30.44 liters.

Now, the mass is still 28.0 grams, so density is mass/volume → 28.0 g / 30.44 L ≈ 0.919 g/L.

Wait, looking at the options, option H is 0.9198 g/l, which is very close to that. Alternatively, maybe I made a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps I should use the ideal gas law instead. The ideal gas law is PV = nRT. Since I know the mass, I can find the number of moles (n) and then use that to find the volume under the new conditions.

At standard conditions (0°C, 760 torr), n = mass / molar mass = 28.0 g / 28 g/mol = 1 mol.

So, n = 1 mol.

Now, using the ideal gas law at the new conditions:

P2 = 600 torr, T2 = 20°C = 293.15 K.

R is the gas constant. If I use R in units of L·torr/(mol·K), then R = 16.732 L·torr/(mol·K).

So, PV = nRT → V = nRT/P.

Plugging in the numbers:

V = (1 mol)(16.732 L·torr/(mol·K))(293.15 K) / 600 torr.

Let me compute that.

16.732 * 293.15 ≈ let me calculate 16 * 293.15 = 4,690.4, and 0.732 * 293.15 ≈ 214.63. So total is approximately 4,690.4 + 214.63 ≈ 4,905.03.

Then, 4,905.03 / 600 ≈ 8.175 L.

Wait, that can't be right because earlier I got around 30 liters, and this is giving me about 8 liters. There must be a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the units. Let me double-check R's value. R is 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K), but if I'm using torr, I need R in L·torr/(mol·K). Since 1 atm = 760 torr, R = (0.0821 L·atm/mol·K) * (760 torr/atm) = 62.364 L·torr/(mol·K). Oh! I think I used the wrong value for R earlier. So R is actually 62.364 L·torr/(mol·K), not 16.732.

Let me recalculate using the correct R.

So V = (1 mol)(62.364 L·torr/(mol·K))(293.15 K) / 600 torr.

Compute numerator: 62.364 * 293.15 ≈ let's see, 60 * 293.15 = 17,589, and 2.364 *293.15 ≈ 693. So total ≈ 18,282.

Then, 18,282 / 600 ≈ 30.47 L.

Ah, that makes more sense. So the volume is approximately 30.47 liters.

Now, the density is mass/volume → 28 g / 30.47 L ≈ 0.919 g/L. So that's about 0.919 g/L, which matches option H: 0.9198 g/l.

Wait, but let me check if I did everything correctly. Another approach could be using the density formula, which is (PM)/(RT), where P is pressure, M is molar mass, R is gas constant, T is temperature.

Density (d) = (P * M) / (R * T).

Given that, let's plug in the values.

P = 600 torr.

M (molar mass of CO) = 28 g/mol.

R = 62.364 L·torr/(mol·K).

T = 293.15 K.

So d = (600 torr * 28 g/mol) / (62.364 L·torr/(mol·K) * 293.15 K).

Compute numerator: 600 * 28 = 16,800 g·torr/mol.

Denominator: 62.364 * 293.15 ≈ 62.364 * 293 ≈ let's compute 62 * 293 = 18,206 and 0.364 *293 ≈ 106.652 → total ≈ 18,312.652 (approx).

So d ≈ 16,800 / 18,312.652 ≈ 0.918 g/L.

Which again gives me around 0.918 g/L, which aligns with option H, 0.9198 g/l.

So I think the correct answer is H.

To determine the density of carbon monoxide (CO) at 20°C and 600 torr, we start by noting that at standard conditions (0°C and 760 torr), 28.0 g of CO occupies 22.4 L, which corresponds to 1 mole of CO. The molar mass of CO is 28 g/mol. 

Using the ideal gas law, \( PV = nRT \), we calculate the volume of CO under the new conditions (20°C or 293.15 K and 600 torr). Rearranging the formula to solve for volume:

\[
V = \frac{nRT}{P}
\]

Substituting the values:
- \( n = 1 \, \text{mol} \)
- \( R = 62.364 \, \text{L·torr/(mol·K)} \)
- \( T = 293.15 \, \text{K} \)
- \( P = 600 \, \text{torr} \)

\[
V = \frac{(1)(62.364)(293.15)}{600} \approx 30.47 \, \text{L}
\]

The density is then calculated as mass divided by volume:

\[
\text{Density} = \frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Volume}} = \frac{28.0 \, \text{g}}{30.47 \, \text{L}} \approx 0.919 \, \text{g/L}
\]

This value closely matches option H: 0.9198 g/L.

Answer: H
