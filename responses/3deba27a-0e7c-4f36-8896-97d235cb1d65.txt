Question:

Frank Bryant is a salesman for the Fast Cool Refrigerator Co. He is compensated for all travel expenses, and is allowed a drawing account of $600 per month. He receives a monthly commission of 2% of his first $30,000 of sales, 2.5% of the next $10,000 of sales, and 3% of all sales in excess of $40,000. Find the amount due him for a month in which his travel expenses paid out of pocket are $332.75, his drawings are $600, and his sales total $41,180.

Options:

A: $1,332.75
B: $942.55
C: $783.40
D: $618.15
E: $725.15
F: $1,035.40
G: $885.40
H: $1,118.15
I: $1,218.15
J: $332.75

Answer:

Okay, so I need to figure out how much Frank Bryant is owed for the month based on his sales and other expenses. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I know that Frank works for Fast Cool Refrigerator Co. as a salesman. His compensation includes travel expenses, a drawing account, and commissions based on his sales. The problem gives me his specific numbers for the month, so I'll need to calculate each part and sum them up.

Let's list out the given information:

- Travel expenses paid out of pocket: $332.75
- Drawings: $600 (this is his monthly allowance, I think it's a fixed amount he can draw regardless of sales)
- Sales total: $41,180

Now, his commission structure is a bit more complex. It's tiered based on sales amounts:

1. 2% on the first $30,000 of sales.
2. 2.5% on the next $10,000 (so that's from $30,001 to $40,000).
3. 3% on any sales beyond $40,000.

Since his total sales are $41,180, I need to calculate each portion separately.

Let me start by calculating each commission tier.

First tier: The first $30,000. 2% of 30k.

So, 0.02 * 30,000 = $600.

Second tier: The next $10,000. That's from 30k to 40k. 2.5% of 10k.

0.025 * 10,000 = $250.

Third tier: The remaining sales beyond $40,000. His total is 41,180, so the excess is 41,180 - 40,000 = $1,180. 3% of this.

0.03 * 1,180 = let me calculate that. 1% is 11.8, so 3% is 35.4. So that's $35.40.

Now, adding up all the commissions: 600 + 250 + 35.40 = 885.40.

Wait, that seems correct. So his total commission is $885.40.

Next, his drawings are $600, which is a fixed amount he's allowed to draw each month. So that's separate from his commission.

He also has travel expenses of $332.75 that he paid out of pocket. I think this is a reimbursement. The question says he's "compensated for all travel expenses," so I believe he gets reimbursed for this amount. So that would add another $332.75 to his total.

So now, adding up all his components:

Commission: $885.40
Drawings: $600
Travel expenses: $332.75

Wait, but wait a second. I need to make sure I'm not double-counting anything. Drawings are a separate allowance, not part of his commission. So yes, they add up.

Wait, but sometimes, in some setups, the drawing account might be a fixed amount, and the commission is separate. So in this case, the 600 is a fixed drawing, and the commission is calculated on sales, which is 885.40. Then, the travel expenses are a reimbursement, so that's separate.

So total amount due would be 600 (drawings) + 332.75 (travel) + 885.40 (commission) = let me add these up.

First, 600 + 332.75 is 932.75. Then, adding 885.40 to that: 932.75 + 885.40.

Let me calculate that. 932 + 885 is 1817, and 0.75 + 0.40 is 1.15, so total is 1818.15? Wait, wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 932.75 + 885.40.

Let me do it properly:

932.75
+885.40
= ?

Adding the cents: 0.75 + 0.40 = 1.15, which is 1 dollar and 15 cents. So 932 + 885 = 1817. Then add 1 dollar to get 1818.15, and the 15 cents makes it 1818.15+0.15=1818.30? Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, perhaps I should add the numbers correctly.

Wait, 932.75 plus 885.40:

932.75
+885.40
= (932 + 885) + (0.75 + 0.40)
= 1817 + 1.15
= 1818.15.

Wait, that seems high. Let me check my calculations again.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure. Maybe the drawing account is part of his fixed compensation, and the commissions are added on top. Let me see the options again.

Wait, looking at the options, the highest is option I: $1,218.15, and option H is $1,118.15. So maybe my calculation is off.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in adding up the numbers. Let me recalculate the total.

Commission: $885.40
Drawings: $600
Travel expenses: $332.75

So adding 885.40 + 600 = 1,485.40. Then add 332.75: 1,485.40 + 332.75.

Let me compute that. 1,485 + 332 = 1,817. Then, 0.40 + 0.75 = 1.15. So total is 1,817 + 1.15 = 1,818.15.

Wait, but looking at the options, the highest is I: $1,218.15. So perhaps I'm including something incorrectly.

Wait a minute, perhaps the drawing account is a fixed amount, and the travel expenses are a reimbursement, so maybe they are separate from the commission. So the total would be:

Commission: $885.40
Drawings: $600
Travel: $332.75

Adding them together: 885.40 + 600 = 1,485.40; 1,485.40 + 332.75 = 1,818.15. But that's not one of the options. Wait, looking back at the options, I see option H is $1,118.15 and option I is $1,218.15. So perhaps I'm including the drawing account incorrectly.

Wait, perhaps the drawing account is part of his compensation, so he is allowed to draw $600 regardless of sales. So his total amount due would be his commission plus his drawings plus his travel expenses.

Wait, but in the question, "he is allowed a drawing account of $600 per month." That typically means he can draw up to $600, but in this case, he drew the full $600. So the $600 is part of his compensation. The travel expenses are paid out of pocket, so he's seeking reimbursement for that.

So the total amount due is commission ($885.40) + drawings ($600) + travel expenses ($332.75). So 885.40 + 600 = 1,485.40 + 332.75 = 1,818.15.

But none of the options match that. So perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the commission.

Wait, let me recheck the commission calculation.

Sales are $41,180.

First tier: 2% of first 30k: 0.02 * 30,000 = $600.

Second tier: 2.5% of next 10k: 0.025 * 10,000 = $250.

Third tier: 3% of the remaining 1,180: 0.03 * 1,180 = $35.40.

Total commission: 600 + 250 + 35.40 = 885.40. That seems correct.

Hmm, perhaps the question is asking for net pay after expenses, but that doesn't make sense because the travel expenses are a reimbursement, not a deduction.

Wait, perhaps I'm supposed to subtract something. Let me read the question again.

"Find the amount due him for a month in which his travel expenses paid out of pocket are $332.75, his drawings are $600, and his sales total $41,180."

So, the amount due would be his commission plus his drawings plus his travel expenses. So 885.40 + 600 + 332.75 = 1,818.15. But that's not an option. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, the options provided are:

A: $1,332.75

B: $942.55

C: $783.40

D: $618.15

E: $725.15

F: $1,035.40

G: $885.40

H: $1,118.15

I: $1,218.15

J: $332.75

So, 1,818.15 isn't among them. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the drawing account is a fixed amount, and the travel expenses are a separate reimbursement, but perhaps the drawing account is subtracted from his commission? That doesn't make sense because the drawing is an allowance, not a deduction.

Wait, maybe the drawing account is subtracted from his total earnings, but that also doesn't make sense because the drawing is a separate allowance. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for net pay after expenses, but that's not clear.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that the drawing account is a fixed amount he takes, regardless of his sales. So, the total amount he's owed is commission plus drawing plus travel.

Wait, but if that's the case, then the total would be 885.40 + 600 + 332.75 = 1,818.15, which isn't an option. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure.

Wait another thought: perhaps the drawing account is not an expense but a fixed amount he is allowed to take each month, so it's added to his commission and travel reimbursement. But again, that leads to the same high number.

Alternatively, perhaps the drawing account is a fixed amount, and the question is asking for the amount he's owed beyond that. But that doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe I'm supposed to calculate his net pay after considering the drawing account as part of his compensation, but perhaps I'm adding it when I shouldn't. Let me see the options again.

Looking at option G: $885.40, which is exactly his commission. So maybe the question is only asking for the commission, but that seems unlikely because the question mentions drawings and travel expenses.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the travel expenses and drawings are part of his compensation, and the commission is additional. So the total is commission plus drawings plus travel.

But as I calculated, that's 885.40 + 600 + 332.75 = 1,818.15, which isn't an option. So perhaps I'm miscalculating the commission.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the commission calculation. Let's recheck.

Sales: $41,180.

First, 2% of 30k: 0.02 * 30,000 = 600.

Next, 2.5% of 10k: 0.025 * 10,000 = 250.

Then, 3% of (41,180 - 40,000) = 3% of 1,180 = 35.40.

Total commission: 600 + 250 + 35.40 = 885.40. That seems correct.

Wait, perhaps the drawing account is a fixed amount, and the question is asking for the total amount due, which is commission plus drawing plus travel. But that leads to 1,818.15, which isn't an option. So perhaps I'm including the drawing account incorrectly.

Wait, perhaps the drawing account is a fixed amount he's allowed to draw, but in this case, he didn't draw the full $600. Wait, the question says his drawings are $600. So he drew the full amount.

Hmm, maybe the mistake is in the way I'm adding up. Let me try another approach.

Wait, perhaps the drawing account is not to be added as a separate amount, but perhaps it's a separate line item. Let me think: the total amount due would be his commission plus his drawings plus his travel expenses. So:

Commission: $885.40
Drawings: $600
Travel: $332.75

Total: 885.40 + 600 = 1,485.40 + 332.75 = 1,818.15. Still not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps the drawing account is a deduction. No, that doesn't make sense because it's an allowance, not a deduction.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the net amount after considering that he has to pay back any over-drawing. But that's not indicated.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the commission is calculated differently. Let me check the commission structure again.

The commission is 2% on first $30k, 2.5% on next $10k, and 3% on anything over $40k. So for $41,180, it's correct as I calculated.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the drawing account is a fixed amount, and the question is only asking for the commission, not the other amounts. But that would make the answer G: $885.40, which is an option. But the question mentions his drawings and travel expenses, so I think it's supposed to include all.

Alternatively, perhaps the drawing account is not to be added, but perhaps it's a fixed amount he's allowed to draw regardless of sales, so it's separate from commission. So the total would be commission plus travel expenses plus drawing. But again, that leads to 1,818.15, which isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the drawing account is $600, which is a fixed salary, and the commission is on top. So the total would be 600 + 885.40 + 332.75 = 1,818.15. But again, no option matches.

Wait, perhaps the drawing account is not part of his earnings but is a separate thing. So the amount due him would be his commission plus his travel expenses. So 885.40 + 332.75 = 1,218.15, which is option I.

Wait, that makes sense because perhaps the drawing account is a fixed amount he's taking, and the commission and travel are additional. But that would mean the drawing is separate, so he's owed 885.40 (commission) + 332.75 (travel) = 1,218.15, plus the drawing of 600, but that's not matching.

Wait, no, perhaps the drawing is a fixed amount he's allowed, so it's part of his earnings. So the total is 600 + 885.40 + 332.75.

Wait, but that's the same as before, 1,818.15, which isn't an option. So perhaps the question is only asking for the commission plus the travel expenses, because the drawing is a fixed amount he's allowed. So 885.40 + 332.75 = 1,218.15, which is option I.

But I'm not sure because the question says "the amount due him for a month," which would include all his earnings, including the drawing. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the drawing account is a fixed amount, and the question is asking for the amount due beyond that. But that would be confusing because the drawing is part of his compensation.

Alternatively, perhaps the drawing account is a fixed amount, and the commission is separate, but the travel expenses are a reimbursement. So his total would be 600 (drawing) + 885.40 (commission) + 332.75 (travel) = 1,818.15, which isn't an option. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the drawing account is not to be added because it's a fixed amount, and the question is asking for the additional amount he's owed beyond his drawing. But that would make the answer 885.40 + 332.75 = 1,218.15, which is option I. But that seems unlikely because the drawing is part of his compensation.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the options again. The options include G: $885.40, which is exactly the commission. So maybe the question is only asking for the commission, but that seems odd because the question mentions the other amounts.

Alternatively, perhaps the drawing account is a fixed amount, and the travel expenses are a reimbursement, so the total would be 600 (drawing) + 332.75 (travel) + 885.40 (commission) = 1,818.15, but that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps the drawing account is a monthly allowance, and it's separate from his earnings. So the amount due him would be his commission plus his travel expenses, as the drawing is a fixed amount he's already taken. So that would be 885.40 + 332.75 = 1,218.15, which is option I.

But I'm not entirely sure because the wording says "the amount due him," which would logically include all forms of compensation. 

Wait, perhaps the drawing account is not part of his earnings but is a separate advance. So the amount he's owed would be his commission plus his travel expenses, as the drawing is a separate allowance. Thus, 885.40 + 332.75 = 1,218.15, option I.

Alternatively, perhaps the drawing is a fixed amount, and the question is asking for the net amount after considering that. But that doesn't make sense.

Wait, looking back, perhaps the correct approach is that the drawing is a fixed amount he's allowed, and the question is asking for the total amount he should receive, which includes his commission, his travel reimbursement, and his drawing. So 885.40 + 332.75 + 600 = 1,818.15, but that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the commission calculation. Let me check again.

Sales: $41,180.

First tier: 2% of 30,000 = $600.

Second tier: 2.5% of 10,000 = $250.

Third tier: 3% of 1,180 = $35.40.

Total commission: 600 + 250 + 35.40 = $885.40. That seems correct.

Wait, perhaps the drawing account is a fixed amount, and the question is only considering the commission and the travel expenses. So 885.40 + 332.75 = $1,218.15, which is option I.

Alternatively, perhaps the drawing account is not part of the calculation because it's a separate expense, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the answer is option G: $885.40, but that would ignore the travel expenses and the drawing, which seems unlikely.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the drawing account is a fixed amount, and the question is asking for the total amount he's owed beyond that, meaning the commission and travel expenses. So 885.40 + 332.75 = 1,218.15, which is option I.

But I'm not entirely confident because the question says he's allowed a drawing account, which implies it's part of his compensation.

Alternatively, perhaps the drawing account is a fixed amount, so he doesn't need to pay it back, and the amount due him is his commission plus his travel expenses plus the drawing. But again, that would be 1,818.15, which isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option G: $885.40, which is just the commission. But the question seems to imply that all three components should be considered.

Wait, perhaps I should look for an option that adds commission and travel expenses only, which would be 885.40 + 332.75 = 1,218.15, option I.

Alternatively, perhaps the drawing account is a fixed amount, and the question is asking for the amount due him beyond that, but that doesn't seem right.

Wait, I'm stuck. Let me try another approach. Let's sum up all amounts:

Commission: $885.40

Drawings: $600

Travel expenses: $332.75

Total = 885.40 + 600 + 332.75 = 1,818.15.

But none of the options match this. So perhaps I'm including something incorrectly.

Wait, perhaps the drawing account is a fixed amount, and the question is only asking for the commission plus the travel expenses, because the drawing is a separate allowance.

So 885.40 + 332.75 = 1,218.15, which is option I.

Alternatively, perhaps the drawing account is not to be included because it's a fixed amount, and the question is asking for the additional amount he's owed beyond that.

Wait, I think I need to go with option I: $1,218.15, which is the sum of commission and travel expenses.

Frank Bryant's compensation includes a commission based on his sales, a fixed drawing account, and reimbursement for travel expenses. 

1. **Commission Calculation**:
   - First $30,000: 2% of $30,000 = $600.
   - Next $10,000: 2.5% of $10,000 = $250.
   - Excess $1,180: 3% of $1,180 = $35.40.
   - **Total Commission**: $600 + $250 + $35.40 = $885.40.

2. **Drawings**: Frank is allowed a fixed drawing account of $600 per month.

3. **Travel Expenses**: Frank paid $332.75 out of pocket, which he is reimbursed for.

Adding these amounts together:
- **Commission**: $885.40
- **Travel Expenses**: $332.75
- **Total Due**: $885.40 + $332.75 = **$1,218.15**

The drawing account is a fixed allowance and is not included in the calculation of the amount due as it is a separate component.
