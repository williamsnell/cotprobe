Okay, so I have this problem here about a tornado. Let me try to understand what's being asked. The question says that the wind velocity 5 miles from the center of a tornado was measured as 30 mph, and the barometer read 29 inches of mercury. I need to calculate the wind velocity half a mile from the center and the barometric pressure there. 

Hmm, I remember that in fluid dynamics, when dealing with things like tornadoes or vortices, the velocity might relate to the distance from the center. Maybe it's similar to how the velocity in a vortex relates to the radius or distance. I think the formula for velocity in a vortex is something like v = (k) / r, where k is a constant and r is the distance from the center. So, if the velocity at 5 miles is 30 mph, then at a different distance, say 0.5 miles, the velocity would be higher because r is smaller.

Wait, let me think. If v = k/r, then k would be v * r. So if I have v1 = 30 mph at r1 = 5 miles, then k = 30 * 5 = 150. Then, at r2 = 0.5 miles, v2 = k / r2 = 150 / 0.5 = 300 mph. So the wind velocity would be 300 mph at 0.5 miles from the center. That seems like a big jump, but tornadoes do have rapidly increasing winds as you get closer to the center.

Now, what about the barometric pressure? The problem gives the barometric pressure as 29 inches of mercury at 5 miles away. I'm not sure how pressure changes with distance from the center. I might be confusing this with how pressure changes in a storm system, but maybe in a tornado, the pressure decreases as you get closer to the center because the air is moving faster (Bernoulli's principle). 

Wait, Bernoulli's equation relates pressure and velocity. The equation is P + ½ρv² + ρgh = constant. Assuming the tornado is a vertical vortex and neglecting the height change (h), the equation simplifies to P + ½ρv² being constant. So if the velocity increases, the pressure should decrease, and vice versa.

But wait, I'm not sure if the pressure given is the atmospheric pressure or the dynamic pressure. Oh, wait, the barometer reads 29 inches of mercury, which is the atmospheric pressure at that point. So as you move towards the center, the atmospheric pressure probably decreases because the air is moving faster, so the static pressure drops.

But I'm a bit confused here. Let me think again. The barometric pressure is the static pressure. So using Bernoulli's equation, P1 + ½ρv1² = P2 + ½ρv2². Because the kinetic energy term would be higher where the velocity is higher, so P would be lower there.

Given that, I can set up the equation. Let me make sure all units are consistent. The given density is ρ_air = 0.00238 slugs/ft³. The velocity is in mph, and pressure is in inches of mercury. I need to convert units appropriately.

First, let's compute P1 and P2.

Given:
v1 = 30 mph
r1 = 5 miles
r2 = 0.5 miles
P1 (barometric) = 29 in Hg

We found v2 = 300 mph.

Using Bernoulli's equation: P1 + ½ρv1² = P2 + ½ρv2².

Let me compute each term.

First, convert velocities from mph to ft/s because density is in slugs/ft³, and units need to be consistent. 1 mph = 5280 ft / 3600 s ≈ 1.4667 ft/s.

v1 = 30 mph = 30 * 1.4667 ≈ 44 ft/s.
v2 = 300 mph = 300 * 1.4667 ≈ 440 ft/s.

Now, compute ½ρv1² and ½ρv2².

ρ = 0.00238 slug/ft³.

½ρv1² = 0.5 * 0.00238 * (44)^2
= 0.00119 * 1936
≈ 2.304 ft H2O.

Similarly, ½ρv2² = 0.5 * 0.00238 * (440)^2
= 0.00119 * (440^2)
= 0.00119 * 193600
≈ 230.384 ft H2O.

Wait, but the problem states that 1 ft Hg = 13.55 ft water. So 1 inch Hg = (13.55 / 12) ft H2O ≈ 1.13 ft H2O per inch.

So P1 is 29 in Hg. To convert to ft H2O: 29 * 1.13 ≈ 32.77 ft H2O.

Now, setting up Bernoulli's equation:

P1 + ½ρv1² = P2 + ½ρv2²

32.77 + 2.304 = P2 + 230.384

So 35.074 ≈ P2 + 230.384

Hmm, that can't be right because P2 would be negative, which doesn't make sense. I must have made a mistake. Wait, perhaps I applied Bernoulli's equation incorrectly. Maybe I should consider that the pressure decreases as velocity increases, so P2 should be less than P1. Let me re-express the equation:

P2 = P1 + ½ρ(v1² - v2²)

Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me re-derive it correctly.

Bernoulli's equation: P1 + ½ρv1² = P2 + ½ρv2²

So rearranged: P2 = P1 + ½ρ(v1² - v2²)

Plugging in the numbers:

P2 = 32.77 + 0.5 * 0.00238 * (44^2 - 440^2)
= 32.77 + 0.00119 * (1936 - 193600)
= 32.77 + 0.00119 * (-191664)
= 32.77 - 229.13
≈ -196.36 ft H2O

Wait, that can't be right because pressure can't be negative. I must have messed up the units somewhere. Maybe I should approach this differently. Alternatively, perhaps the pressure isn't changing because the tornado is a balance between the pressure gradient and centrifugal force, but that's getting complicated.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The barometric pressure given is the static pressure at 5 miles from the center. As you move closer to the center, the static pressure decreases because the velocity increases, so the pressure should drop.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the pressure at the center is lower, but we're being asked about the pressure at 0.5 miles. But without more information, maybe the pressure remains the same? That doesn't make sense because the velocity is changing.

Wait, perhaps the pressure is the same because the barometric pressure is measured relative to a reference, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the barometric pressure given is the same at both points because it's the atmospheric pressure outside the tornado? No, that doesn't seem right. The barometric pressure inside the tornado would be lower.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the pressure inside the tornado is lower, but the question is about the barometric pressure at 0.5 miles from the center. Alternatively, maybe the barometric pressure remains the same, and the change is due to the dynamic pressure. Wait, perhaps the pressure given is the static pressure, and at 0.5 miles, the static pressure is lower.

But I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to find another approach. Maybe I should look for a relationship between the pressure and the radius in a tornado. I recall that in a tornado, the pressure decreases as you move towards the center, which causes the wind speed to increase.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is assuming that the pressure is the same because the question gives only one barometric reading, and it's the same as the outside. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the wind speed is higher inside, so the pressure should be lower.

Wait, maybe the pressure at 5 miles is 29 in Hg, and at 0.5 miles, it's lower. So using Bernoulli's equation, I can calculate the pressure at 0.5 miles.

Let me try that again with correct unit conversions.

Given:
v1 = 30 mph = 44 ft/s
v2 = 300 mph = 440 ft/s
P1 = 29 in Hg = 29 * 13.55 / 12 ft H2O ≈ 29 * 1.13 ≈ 32.77 ft H2O

So Bernoulli's equation:

P1 + ½ρv1² = P2 + ½ρv2²

32.77 + 0.5 * 0.00238 * (44)^2 = P2 + 0.5 * 0.00238 * (440)^2

Compute each term:

0.5 * 0.00238 * 44² = 0.00119 * 1936 ≈ 2.304 ft H2O
0.5 * 0.00238 * 440² = 0.00119 * 193600 ≈ 230.384 ft H2O

So:

32.77 + 2.304 = P2 + 230.384

35.074 = P2 + 230.384

Subtract 230.384 from both sides: P2 = 35.074 - 230.384 ≈ -195.31 ft H2O

Wait, that can't be right because pressure can't be negative. I must have made a mistake in the approach.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider that the pressure inside the tornado is lower, but the barometric pressure is measured as 29 in Hg at 5 miles. Maybe the barometric pressure at 0.5 miles is the same as outside, but that doesn't make sense because the pressure inside should be lower.

Alternatively, perhaps the pressure doesn't change with distance, but that's not possible because velocity increases, so pressure should decrease.

Wait, maybe the problem is assuming that the pressure remains the same, so the barometric pressure at 0.5 miles is also 29 in Hg, but that doesn't align with the physics.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking about the velocity and not the pressure, but the question clearly asks for both.

Wait, looking at the options, I see that option I says wind velocity is 300 mph and pressure is 25.62 in Hg. How did they get 25.62?

Let me think differently. Maybe the pressure change is due to the height difference? Wait, no, the problem doesn't mention height, so I should ignore that.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula for pressure in a vortex. The pressure in a vortex is given by P = P0 - (ρ v^2)/(2 g), where g is gravity. Wait, but I'm not sure if that's the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the pressure decreases by the dynamic pressure term. But in that case, the static pressure would be the given barometric pressure minus the dynamic pressure.

Wait, let's try that. The static pressure at a point is the barometric pressure minus the dynamic pressure. So P2 = P1 - (½ ρ (v2² - v1²)).

Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me think again. The total pressure is static pressure plus dynamic pressure. So static pressure P = P_total - ½ ρ v².

Wait, if I'm at 5 miles, the static pressure is 29 in Hg, and the velocity is 30 mph. At 0.5 miles, the velocity is 300 mph. So the static pressure at 0.5 miles would be P2 = P1 - ½ ρ (v2² - v1²).

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me write the equation correctly.

P1 = P0 + ½ ρ v1² (if moving from rest to velocity)
But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the static pressure at a point is P = P0 - ½ ρ v^2, where P0 is the pressure when velocity is zero.

So if at 5 miles, the velocity is 30 mph, then P1 = P0 - ½ ρ v1².

At 0.5 miles, P2 = P0 - ½ ρ v2².

So the difference in pressure between the two points would be P2 - P1 = (P0 - ½ ρ v2²) - (P0 - ½ ρ v1²) )= ½ ρ (v1² - v2²).

But without knowing P0, I can't find the absolute pressure. Hmm, this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the pressure at both points is the same, which would mean that the pressure doesn't change with distance. But that doesn't make sense because velocity increases, so pressure should decrease.

Wait, maybe I should look for an answer where the velocity is 300 mph and the pressure is lower than 29 in Hg. Looking at the options, option I has 300 mph and 25.62 in Hg. How did they get 25.62?

Let me try to compute the pressure difference using the dynamic pressure.

The dynamic pressure at 0.5 miles is ½ ρ v2².

v2 = 440 ft/s (from earlier).

Dynamic pressure = 0.5 * 0.00238 * (440)^2 ≈ 0.00119 * 193600 ≈ 230.384 ft H2O.

Convert that to inches of mercury: since 1 ft Hg = 13.55 ft H2O, so 230.384 ft H2O = 230.384 / 13.55 ≈ 17.0 in Hg.

So the dynamic pressure is about 17 in Hg. If the static pressure at 5 miles is 29 in Hg, then at 0.5 miles, the static pressure would be 29 - 17 = 12 in Hg. But that's not one of the options. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should consider that the static pressure at 5 miles is 29 in Hg, and the dynamic pressure there is ½ ρ v1².

v1 = 44 ft/s.

Dynamic pressure at 5 miles: 0.5 * 0.00238 * 44^2 ≈ 0.00119 * 1936 ≈ 2.304 ft H2O ≈ 2.304 / 13.55 ≈ 0.17 in Hg.

So the static pressure at 5 miles is P1 = 29 in Hg, which includes the dynamic pressure. At 0.5 miles, the dynamic pressure is 17 in Hg as before.

So the static pressure at 0.5 miles would be P2 = P1 - (dynamic pressure difference).

Wait, but P1 already includes the dynamic pressure at that point. So perhaps P2 = P1 - (dynamic pressure at 0.5 miles) + (dynamic pressure at 5 miles). Wait, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the static pressure at 0.5 miles is P2 = P1 - (½ ρ (v2² - v1²)).

Wait, let me think. The total pressure is static pressure plus dynamic pressure. So at 5 miles, P_total = P1 + ½ ρ v1².

At 0.5 miles, P_total = P2 + ½ ρ v2².

Assuming that the total pressure is the same at both points (which it isn't, because in a tornado, the pressure is lower towards the center), but if I assume that, then:

P1 + ½ ρ v1² = P2 + ½ ρ v2².

So P2 = P1 + ½ ρ (v1² - v2²).

Plugging in the numbers:

v1² = 44^2 = 1936
v2² = 440^2 = 193600

So ½ ρ (v1² - v2²) = 0.5 * 0.00238 * (1936 - 193600)
= 0.00119 * (-191664)
≈ -229.13 ft H2O.

Convert to inches Hg: -229.13 ft H2O * (1 in Hg / 13.55 ft H2O) ≈ -16.92 in Hg.

So P2 = 29 in Hg + (-16.92 in Hg) ≈ 12.08 in Hg.

But none of the options have 12 in Hg. The closest is option I with 25.62 in Hg. Hmm, so I must be missing something.

Wait, maybe the pressure doesn't drop that much. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the barometric pressure at 0.5 miles is the same as at 5 miles, which is 29 in Hg. But that would mean the pressure doesn't change, which might not be physically accurate, but perhaps the problem assumes that.

Wait, looking back at the options, option D says wind velocity is 150 mph and pressure is 29 in Hg. That would suggest that the velocity doesn't change, which contradicts the vortex assumption.

Option I has wind velocity 300 mph and pressure 25.62 in Hg. How did they get 25.62? Let me compute 29 - (something).

Wait, perhaps the pressure changes based on the velocity squared. Let me compute the pressure difference.

The pressure difference ΔP = P1 - P2 = ½ ρ (v2² - v1²).

So:

ΔP = 0.5 * 0.00238 * (440^2 - 44^2)
= 0.00119 * (193600 - 1936)
= 0.00119 * 191664
≈ 228.3 ft H2O.

Convert to inches Hg: 228.3 / 13.55 ≈ 16.88 in Hg.

So P2 = P1 - ΔP = 29 - 16.88 ≈ 12.12 in Hg. But that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps the problem assumes that the pressure is the same, so the barometric pressure is still 29 in Hg, and only the velocity changes. But that doesn't make sense because the pressure should drop as velocity increases.

Alternatively, perhaps the pressure at 0.5 miles is the same as at 5 miles because the tornado is part of a larger system where the pressure is balanced. But that seems unlikely.

Wait, looking at the options again, option I has pressure 25.62 in Hg. How is that derived? Let me think differently. Maybe the pressure is calculated using the formula P = P0 * (v1 / v2)^2. Because in a vortex, the pressure might scale with the square of the velocity.

So if P1 = 29 in Hg at v1=30 mph, then P2 = 29 * (30/300)^2 = 29 * (1/10)^2 = 29 * 0.01 = 0.29 in Hg. That's way too low and not matching any options.

Alternatively, perhaps the pressure is inversely proportional to the square of the radius. Since the radius is 1/10th, the pressure would be 100 times higher, but that would give P2 = 29 * 100 = 2900 in Hg, which is impossible.

Hmm, maybe I should consider that the pressure gradient is balanced by the centrifugal force. The formula for pressure in a vortex is P = P0 - (ρ v²)/(2 g). But without knowing g or P0, I can't proceed.

Wait, maybe I should use the fact that pressure decreases with the velocity squared, so P is proportional to 1/v². So P2 = P1 * (v1² / v2²) = 29 * (30^2 / 300^2) = 29 * (900 / 90000) = 29 * (1/100) = 0.29 in Hg. Again, not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the pressure remains the same because the question only gives one pressure reading, and it's the same everywhere. But that doesn't make sense physically.

Wait, maybe the pressure at 0.5 miles is lower by the amount of dynamic pressure. The dynamic pressure at 0.5 miles is ½ ρ v2².

v2 = 300 mph = 440 ft/s.

Dynamic pressure = 0.5 * 0.00238 * (440)^2 ≈ 230.384 ft H2O ≈ 230.384 /13.55 ≈ 17 in Hg.

So static pressure at 0.5 miles would be 29 -17 = 12 in Hg. But that's not an option. Hmm.

Wait, looking at option I, the pressure is 25.62 in Hg. Let me see how that number comes about.

25.62 is 29 minus 3.38. How?

Wait, perhaps the pressure decrease is based on the ratio of velocities. v2 is 10 times v1, so the dynamic pressure is 100 times higher. So the dynamic pressure at 0.5 miles is 100 times that at 5 miles.

At 5 miles, dynamic pressure is ½ ρ v1² = 2.304 ft H2O ≈ 0.17 in Hg.

At 0.5 miles, dynamic pressure is 230.384 ft H2O ≈ 17 in Hg.

So static pressure at 0.5 miles is 29 -17 = 12 in Hg. Not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the fact that the pressure difference is proportional to the velocity difference. But I'm stuck.

Wait, maybe I should just go with the velocity part. The velocity at 0.5 miles is 300 mph, as calculated earlier. Now looking at the options, options A, E, F, G, H, I, J have 300 mph as an option. Now, the pressure part: which option has a lower pressure than 29 in Hg.

Looking at the options, I is 25.62, which is lower. How did they get that number?

Wait, maybe I should calculate the pressure using the formula P = P0 - (ρ v^2)/(2 g), but I don't have P0 or g. Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the pressure change is small and uses a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the pressure at 0.5 miles is the same as at 5 miles, but that can't be right.

Wait, maybe I should look for an option where the pressure is 25.62 in Hg. How is that number derived?

Wait, 25.62 is approximately 29 * (1 - (v2² - v1²)/(2g)). But without knowing g, I can't compute that.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the formula P = P0 * (v1 / v2)^2. So P2 = 29 * (30/300)^2 = 29 * (1/10)^2 = 29 * 0.01 = 0.29 in Hg. That's not it.

Wait, maybe the pressure is inversely proportional to the radius. So P2 = P1 * (r2 / r1). Since r2 is 1/10 of r1, P2 = 29 * 10 = 290 in Hg. Not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the pressure is the same, and the answer is D: 150 mph and 29 in Hg. But that doesn't fit the velocity calculation.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the velocity. Let me double-check.

The velocity in a vortex is v = k / r, so v2 = (v1 * r1) / r2.

v1 =30 mph, r1=5 miles, r2=0.5 miles.

v2 = (30 *5)/0.5 = 300 mph. So that part is correct.

So velocity is 300 mph. Now, looking at the options, the ones with 300 mph are A, E, I.

A: 300 mph, 29 in Hg.

I: 300 mph, 25.62 in Hg.

E: 300 mph, 23 in Hg.

So now, the pressure must be lower than 29. So I or E.

But how to find the correct pressure.

Wait, perhaps the problem is assuming that the pressure drop is due to the velocity change, using Bernoulli's equation, but I must have made a mistake earlier.

Let me try again with correct unit conversions.

Given:

v1 =30 mph =44 ft/s

v2=300 mph=440 ft/s

P1=29 in Hg =29 * 13.55 /12 ft H2O ≈ 32.77 ft H2O.

Using Bernoulli's equation:

P1 + ½ρv1² = P2 + ½ρv2²

32.77 + (0.5 * 0.00238 * 44^2) = P2 + (0.5 * 0.00238 *440^2)

Compute:

0.5 *0.00238 *44^2 =0.00119 *1936=2.304 ft H2O.

0.5 *0.00238 *440^2=0.00119 *193600=230.384 ft H2O.

So:

32.77 +2.304 = P2 +230.384

35.074 = P2 +230.384

P2=35.074-230.384= -195.31 ft H2O.

That's impossible, so I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the pressure inside the tornado is much lower, but the barometric pressure is measured as 29 in Hg at 5 miles. Maybe the barometric pressure at 0.5 miles is still 29 in Hg, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the pressure given is the dynamic pressure, not the static. If P1 is the dynamic pressure, then static pressure would be higher.

Wait, perhaps the problem is only asking for the velocity, and the pressure remains the same. So the answer would be option A: 300 mph and 29 in Hg. But that seems unlikely because the pressure should change.

Alternatively, perhaps the pressure remains the same because the question doesn't provide enough info, but that's not correct.

Wait, maybe the pressure at 0.5 miles is the same as at 5 miles, so the answer is A: 300 mph, 29 in Hg.

But that contradicts the physics. Alternatively, perhaps the pressure is lower, and the correct option is I: 300 mph, 25.62 in Hg.

But how did they get 25.62? Maybe they used a different approach.

Wait, 25.62 is exactly 29 - (something). Let me compute 29 -25.62=3.38 in Hg.

So the pressure drop is 3.38 in Hg. How does that relate to the velocity?

Dynamic pressure at 0.5 miles is 17 in Hg (from earlier), so 29-17=12, which doesn't match.

Alternatively, perhaps the pressure drop is proportional to the square of the velocity ratio.

(v2/v1)=10, so (v2/v1)^2=100. So pressure drop is 100 times, but that would make the pressure negative, which isn't possible.

Wait, perhaps the pressure is calculated using the formula P = P0 * (v1/v2)^2.

So P2=29*(30/300)^2=29*(1/100)=0.29 in Hg. No, that's not it.

Alternatively, maybe the pressure is inversely proportional to velocity, so P2=29*(30/300)=29*(1/10)=2.9 in Hg. Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the pressure is the same because the question doesn't provide enough info, so the answer is A.

But I'm not confident. Looking at the options, the only one with 300 mph and lower pressure is I: 25.62 in Hg.

I think I'll go with option I: wind velocity 300 mph and barometric pressure 25.62 in Hg.
</think>

The problem involves calculating the wind velocity and barometric pressure at 0.5 miles from the center of a tornado, given the wind velocity and barometric pressure at 5 miles. The wind velocity at 5 miles is 30 mph, and the barometric pressure is 29 inches of mercury. Using the relationship for velocity in a vortex, \( v = \frac{k}{r} \), where \( k \) is a constant and \( r \) is the distance from the center, the velocity at 0.5 miles is calculated as:

\[
v_2 = \frac{v_1 \cdot r_1}{r_2} = \frac{30 \cdot 5}{0.5} = 300 \, \text{mph}.
\]

For the barometric pressure, Bernoulli's equation is applied:

\[
P_1 + \frac{1}{2} \rho v_1^2 = P_2 + \frac{1}{2} \rho v_2^2,
\]

where \( \rho \) is the air density. Converting velocities to ft/s and pressures to consistent units, the calculations show that the pressure at 0.5 miles is lower than at 5 miles. However, the exact derivation of the pressure value \( 25.62 \, \text{in Hg} \) is unclear, but it aligns with the assumption of a pressure drop as velocity increases.

From the options, the only one consistent with a velocity of 300 mph and a lower pressure than 29 in Hg is:

**I: Wind velocity is 300 mph and barometric pressure is 25.62 in. mercury.**

I

**Answer: I**
