Okay, so I need to figure out which of these options is an example of devolution. Hmm, devolution is a term I've heard before, but I'm not exactly sure what it means. Let me think. From what I remember, devolution is when power or authority is transferred from a central government to a lower level, like states or regions. It's the opposite of centralization, where the central government holds more power.

Looking at the options, I need to find one where the federal government is giving more power to the states or allowing them to make their own decisions. Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: Allowing states to decide how to meet federally mandated greenhouse gas emissions targets. So the federal government sets the targets, but states can choose their methods. That sounds like devolution because the states have some autonomy in how they achieve the goals set by the central government.

Option B: The federal government setting a minimum wage that all states must meet. Here, the federal government is imposing a rule that states have to follow. This doesn't seem like devolution; it looks more like the central government is imposing standards, taking away state autonomy.

Option C: A state being prevented from implementing a more stringent fuel efficiency standard than the federal one. So the federal government is stopping states from doing more, which is actually limiting state power. That's the opposite of devolution.

Option D: A "race to the bottom" where states compete to have fewer environmental regulations. This might be a result of too little federal oversight, but I'm not sure if it's devolution. It's more about states competing to lower regulations, which might be due to federal policies allowing them to do so, but it's not directly an example of devolution itself.

Option E: A state being forced to comply with federal immigration policies. Again, this is the central government enforcing policies on the states, which doesn't sound like devolution.

Option F: The federal government establishing nationwide educational standards. This is like the federal level setting standards that states must meet, which again is centralization, not devolution.

Option G: A state choosing to implement stricter gun control laws than federal mandates. This is the state acting on its own, but whether that's allowed depends on federal laws. If the federal government allows states to have stricter laws, that would be devolution. But if the states can't override federal laws, then it's not. I'm not sure, but I think this might be more about state sovereignty rather than devolution.

Option H: A state decriminalizing all drug use, contrary to federal law. Similar to G, this is the state acting independently, but it's in conflict with federal law. If the federal government allows states to make their own drug laws, that's devolution. But if the federal law is overriding, then it's not. I'm not certain about this one.

Option I: A state legalizing marijuana possession conflicting with federal law. This is similar to H. If the federal government allows states to decide on marijuana laws, that's devolution. Otherwise, it's not. But often, federal law can override state laws, especially on things like marijuana, so this might not be the best example.

Option J: The federal government overriding a state's decision on same-sex marriage. This is definitely centralization, not devolution. The federal government is taking away state power.

So, looking back, the best example seems to be A: Allowing states to decide how to meet federally mandated targets. Because the federal government sets the target but lets the states choose their methods, which transfers some authority down.

The correct answer is A: Allowing states to decide how to meet federally mandated greenhouse gas emissions targets. This is an example of devolution because it involves transferring decision-making authority from the federal government to the states, allowing them to implement the targets in ways that suit their specific circumstances.
