Okay, so I've got this problem here about a finite set X. The question says that the number of subsets with exactly 3 elements is 14 more than the number of subsets with exactly 2 elements. I need to find how many subsets have exactly 4 elements. The options are from A to J, and I have to choose the correct one.

Hmm, let's start by recalling some combinatorics. The number of subsets of a set X with exactly k elements is given by the combination formula C(n, k), where n is the total number of elements in X. So, if X has n elements, then:

- The number of 3-element subsets is C(n,3).
- The number of 2-element subsets is C(n,2).

According to the problem, C(n,3) is 14 more than C(n,2). So, mathematically, that's:

C(n,3) = C(n,2) + 14.

I need to find n first because once I know n, I can compute C(n,4), which is the number of 4-element subsets. So, let's write out the combinations:

C(n,2) = n(n-1)/2
C(n,3) = n(n-1)(n-2)/6.

So, substituting these into the equation:

n(n-1)(n-2)/6 = n(n-1)/2 + 14.

Hmm, maybe I can simplify this equation. Let's multiply both sides by 6 to eliminate the denominators:

n(n-1)(n-2) = 3n(n-1) + 84.

Let me expand the left side first. So, expanding n(n-1)(n-2):

First, multiply (n-1)(n-2) = n² - 3n + 2. Then multiply by n: n³ - 3n² + 2n.

So, left side becomes n³ - 3n² + 2n.

The right side is 3n(n-1) + 84. Let's expand 3n(n-1):

3n² - 3n. So, right side is 3n² - 3n + 84.

Now, putting it all together:

n³ - 3n² + 2n = 3n² - 3n + 84.

Let's move all terms to the left side:

n³ - 3n² + 2n - 3n² + 3n - 84 = 0.

Wait, that's not correct. When moving terms, I should subtract the right side from both sides. So:

n³ - 3n² + 2n - (3n² - 3n + 84) = 0.

Which is:

n³ - 3n² + 2n -3n² +3n -84 = 0.

Combine like terms:

n³ + (-3n² -3n²) + (2n +3n) + (-84) = 0.

So:

n³ -6n² +5n -84 = 0.

Hmm, so now I have the cubic equation: n³ -6n² +5n -84 = 0.

I need to solve for n. Since n is the number of elements in a set, it must be a positive integer, probably not too big. So I'll try small integer values to see which one satisfies the equation.

Let me try n=7:

7³ = 343
6*7²=6*49=294
5*7=35
So, 343 - 294 +35 -84 = (343-294)=49 +35=84 -84=0. Oh, it works!

So n=7. That's the number of elements in set X.

Now, I need to find the number of 4-element subsets, which is C(7,4).

Calculating C(7,4):

C(7,4) = 7! / (4! * (7-4)!) = (7*6*5*4!)/(4! *3*2*1) = (7*6*5)/(6) = (7*5)=35.

Wait, wait, let me compute that again. Let me do it step by step:

7! = 5040
4! =24
(7-4)! =3! =6

So, C(7,4) =5040/(24*6) =5040/(144) = 35.

Yes, so C(7,4) is 35. So the number of 4-element subsets is 35.

Looking at the options, J is 35. So the answer should be J.

The number of elements in set X is 7, calculated by solving the equation derived from the given condition. The number of 4-element subsets is C(7,4) = 35.

Answer: J
