Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to find the period of a signal. The signal is given by x₁(t) = cos(3πt) − 4cos(5πt − 0.5π). Hmm, okay, I remember that the period of a cosine function is related to its frequency. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, each term in the signal is a cosine function, so each has its own period. The overall period of the signal x₁(t) will be the least common multiple (LCM) of the periods of its individual components. So I need to find the periods of cos(3πt) and cos(5πt − 0.5π) separately.

Let's start with the first term: cos(3πt). The general form of a cosine function is cos(ωt + φ), where ω is the angular frequency. The period T is given by 2π divided by ω. So here, ω is 3π. So the period T₁ would be 2π / (3π) = 2/3. Wait, that simplifies to 2/3. Hmm, okay, so T₁ is 2/3 seconds.

Now the second term is cos(5πt − 0.5π). Again, ω is 5π, so the period T₂ is 2π / (5π) = 2/5. So T₂ is 2/5 seconds.

Wait, but I'm trying to find the period of the entire signal, which is a combination of these two. So the overall period will be the LCM of T₁ and T₂. But wait, T₁ is 2/3 and T₂ is 2/5. Hmm, how do I find the LCM of two fractions?

I remember that the LCM of two numbers can be found by taking the LCM of the numerators divided by the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the denominators. So LCM(a/b, c/d) = LCM(a,c) / GCD(b,d). Let me apply that here.

The numerators are both 2, so LCM(2,2) is 2. The denominators are 3 and 5. The GCD of 3 and 5 is 1, since they're both primes. So the LCM would be 2 / 1 = 2. Wait, that can't be right because 2/3 and 2/5 are both fractions less than 1. Let me think again.

Alternatively, maybe I should express each period as a fraction and find the smallest number that both fractions divide into. So T₁ is 2/3 and T₂ is 2/5. Let me think about their multiples.

Wait, maybe another approach. The period of each component is T₁ = 2/3 and T₂ = 2/5. So I can write these as fractions: T₁ = 2/3, T₂ = 2/5. To find the LCM, perhaps I can find the LCM of their denominators when expressed with a common denominator. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to consider the periods as fractions and find the LCM of the two.

Wait, another approach: The LCM of two periods T₁ and T₂ is the smallest T such that T is an integer multiple of both T₁ and T₂. So T = k*T₁ = m*T₂, where k and m are integers. So substituting, k*(2/3) = m*(2/5). Let's solve for k and m.

Multiply both sides by 15 to eliminate denominators: 10k = 6m → 5k = 3m. So m has to be a multiple of 5, let's say m=5n, and k=3n, where n is an integer. The smallest n is 1, so k=3 and m=5. Thus, T = 3*(2/3) = 2, and T=5*(2/5)=2. So the LCM is 2.

Wait, that makes sense. So each component's period divides into 2. Because 2 divided by T₁ (2/3) is 3, which is an integer, and 2 divided by T₂ (2/5) is 5, also an integer. So the overall period is 2 seconds.

Wait, but looking at the options, option H is 2. So the answer should be H.

The signal is a combination of two cosine functions. The period of each component is calculated, and the overall period is the least common multiple (LCM) of these periods. The LCM of 2/3 and 2/5 is found to be 2. Therefore, the period of the signal is 2 seconds.

Answer: H
