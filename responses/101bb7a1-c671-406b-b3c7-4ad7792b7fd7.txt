Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully. The question is about determining the composition of a mixture at equilibrium when inert gas is added. Hmm, right, I remember that inert gases can affect the total pressure but not the partial pressures of the reacting gases. 

The problem states that the initial mixture is composed of 0.5 mol of carbon monoxide (CO) and 2.38 mol of air. The conditions are 3000 K and 1 atm pressure. I'm supposed to calculate the composition at equilibrium. The options given are from A to J, each with different amounts of CO.

Wait, so the key here is understanding how the addition of inert gas affects the equilibrium. I remember that Le Chatelier's principle says that if you add an inert gas at constant pressure, the system will adjust by shifting the equilibrium to the side with more moles of gas to reduce the pressure. But wait, in this case, the mixture is initially 0.5 mol CO and 2.38 mol air. Wait, air is a mixture of gases, mainly N2 and O2, which are diatomic, so each mole of air contributes more moles of gas.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think. The reaction here isn't given, but I think the system must be considering the decomposition or reaction of CO with something, but the problem doesn't specify. Oh wait, maybe it's a reaction involving CO and air, perhaps combustion? Or maybe the dissociation of CO into its elements. Wait, but without the reaction equation, it's a bit tricky. Hmm.

Wait, wait, perhaps the problem is about the dissociation of CO into C and O, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a reaction where CO reacts with O2 to form CO2, but that's not given. Hmm. Since the problem mentions the effect of inert gas, maybe the reaction is CO reacting with something else, but without the equation, I'm a bit stuck.

Wait, perhaps the problem is more straightforward. Let me think again. The initial mixture is 0.5 mol CO and 2.38 mol air. Air is mainly N2 and O2, which are inert. So adding more inert gas (maybe the problem is adding more inert gas to this mixture?), but wait, the problem says the mixture is initially composed of these, so perhaps the inert gas is already present. Or is the 2.38 mol air considered as the inert component? Wait, air isn't inert because it contains O2, which can react, but in this context, maybe the problem is treating air as an inert gas for the purpose of this calculation.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about the partial pressures. Let me think. At equilibrium, the partial pressures of the gases matter. When you add an inert gas at constant pressure, the partial pressures of the reacting gases decrease because the total pressure is the same, but the number of moles increases. Wait, but in this case, the initial mixture already includes air (2.38 mol), which is a gas, so when the system is at 1 atm, the partial pressures are proportional to their mole fractions.

Wait, but perhaps the reaction is something like 2CO(g) ⇌ C(s) + O2(g), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is CO reacting with O2 to form CO2. Let me assume a general reaction. Suppose the reaction is CO(g) ⇌ C(s) + 0.5 O2(g). But I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe it's the dissociation of CO into solid carbon and oxygen gas.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is simpler. Let me think again. The question is about the effect of inert gas on the equilibrium composition. The problem says "the effect of inert gas on equilibrium composition can be determined by the computation of the mixture composition." So perhaps the inert gas is being added, and we need to calculate the new equilibrium.

Wait, but the initial mixture is 0.5 mol CO and 2.38 mol air. So the total initial moles are 0.5 + 2.38 = 2.88 mol. At 1 atm and 3000 K, using the ideal gas law, the volume can be calculated, but maybe that's not necessary here.

Since air is considered as an inert gas here, adding more inert gas would change the total pressure. Wait, but the problem states that the system is at 1 atm pressure. So if the initial pressure is 1 atm, and we add more inert gas, the total pressure would increase, but the problem states the conditions are 1 atm and 3000 K. So perhaps the inert gas is being added at constant pressure, which would cause the system to adjust.

Wait, but maybe the problem is that the initial mixture is 0.5 mol CO and 2.38 mol air (inert). So the total initial moles are 2.88 mol. At 1 atm and 3000 K, the volume V can be found using PV = nRT. But I'm not sure if that's needed.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the shift in equilibrium when more inert gas is added, which doesn't participate in the reaction. If the reaction is, say, CO decomposing into C and O2, then adding inert gas would decrease the partial pressure of CO, shifting the equilibrium to produce more CO. Wait, no, wait. Let me think: for a reaction aA + bB ⇌ cC + dD, adding inert gas at constant pressure would decrease the partial pressures of all gases involved, shifting the equilibrium toward the side with more moles of gas.

Wait, but in this problem, perhaps the reaction is such that adding inert gas (which increases the total pressure) would cause the system to shift to the side with fewer moles of gas to reduce pressure. Wait, no, wait: when the total pressure is increased by adding inert gas at constant volume, the system shifts toward the side with fewer moles to reduce pressure. But in this problem, the pressure is kept constant at 1 atm. So adding more inert gas would require the system to adjust, perhaps by shifting the equilibrium.

Wait, but perhaps the initial mixture is at 1 atm without the inert gas, and then we add inert gas, keeping the total pressure at 1 atm. So the partial pressures of the reacting gases would decrease. Let me think about how that affects the equilibrium.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the initial mixture is 0.5 mol CO and 2.38 mol air (inert), so the total initial moles are 2.88. At 1 atm and 3000 K, the volume is V = nRT/P = (2.88 mol)(0.0821 L·atm/mol·K)(3000 K) / 1 atm. But maybe this isn't necessary unless I need the volume for further calculations.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about the shift in equilibrium when inert gas is added. If the reaction is, for example, CO(g) ⇌ C(s) + 0.5 O2(g), then the number of moles on the product side is 1.5 (since 0.5 mole of O2 is produced). So if the system is at equilibrium, and then inert gas is added, the partial pressure of CO would decrease, shifting the equilibrium to the right to produce more CO. Wait, no, when partial pressure of CO decreases, according to Le Chatelier's principle, the system would shift to the side that produces more CO, which is the left. Wait, no, wait: the reaction is CO → C + 0.5 O2. So if CO's partial pressure decreases (because we added inert gas, lowering its partial pressure), the system would shift to the right to produce more CO to counteract the decrease. Wait, no, that's not right. If the partial pressure of CO decreases, the system would shift toward the products to try to increase the concentration of CO. Wait, no, wait: Le Chatelier says that if a reactant's concentration decreases, the system shifts to produce more reactants. So in this case, if [CO] decreases, the system shifts to the left, producing more CO and reducing O2. Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's the case here.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck because I don't know the exact reaction. Maybe I should think differently. Since the problem is about the effect of inert gas on the equilibrium composition, perhaps the key is that adding inert gas doesn't affect the partial pressures of the reacting gases, so the mole fractions remain the same. Wait, but that's only true if the pressure is allowed to change. If the pressure is kept constant, adding inert gas would change the total moles, thus changing the mole fractions of the reacting gases.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the fact that adding inert gas doesn't affect the equilibrium constant Kp, but it does change the partial pressures, thus shifting the equilibrium.

Wait, but without knowing the reaction, it's hard to proceed. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is simpler. The initial mixture is 0.5 mol CO and 2.38 mol air. Suppose the reaction is CO(g) ⇌ C(s) + 0.5 O2(g). The total moles at equilibrium would change based on how much CO dissociates. Let me denote x as the moles of CO that dissociate.

At equilibrium:
Moles of CO = 0.5 - x
Moles of C = x
Moles of O2 = 0.5 x

But since C is a solid, its amount doesn't affect the partial pressures. The total moles at equilibrium would be (0.5 - x) + 0.5x = 0.5 - 0.5x.

Wait, but the problem states that the system is at 1 atm and 3000 K. If the initial moles are 0.5 CO + 2.38 air (inert), then the initial total moles are 2.88. When the reaction proceeds, the moles of CO decrease by x, and O2 increases by 0.5x. So the total moles at equilibrium would be 2.88 - x + 0.5x = 2.88 - 0.5x.

Wait, but I'm not sure how this helps without the equilibrium constant. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the shift caused by adding inert gas, but I'm getting stuck.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the inert gas is being added, but the system is at constant pressure. So when you add inert gas, the total pressure increases, but since the system is at constant pressure, the volume must adjust. Alternatively, the system adjusts by shifting the equilibrium to reduce the pressure.

Wait, but maybe the problem is that the initial mixture is 0.5 mol CO and 2.38 mol air (inert), so the total moles are 2.88. At equilibrium, the partial pressure of CO would be (moles of CO)/(total moles) * total pressure.

Wait, but without knowing the reaction, I'm not sure how to proceed. Maybe the problem is simply about the mole fraction of CO in the mixture after adding inert gas. But that doesn't make sense because the mole fraction would decrease if inert gas is added, but the options suggest that CO's amount might change.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about the decomposition of CO into C and O2, and the effect of adding inert gas (like N2) on the equilibrium. Let me assume that the reaction is:

2 CO(g) ⇌ C(s) + O2(g)

In this case, the number of moles of gas on the left is 2, and on the right is 1. So adding inert gas would decrease the partial pressures of CO and O2, shifting the equilibrium to the left to produce more CO, thus increasing the amount of CO at equilibrium.

Wait, but if the system is initially at equilibrium without inert gas, adding inert gas would shift it. Let me think: initially, without inert gas, the total moles are 0.5 CO and 2.38 air. When inert gas is added, the total pressure remains at 1 atm, but the total moles increase, so the mole fraction of CO decreases. The reaction would shift to the left to produce more CO, which would increase the amount of CO.

Wait, but I'm not sure about this. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that adding inert gas doesn't affect the partial pressures of CO and O2, so the equilibrium remains the same. But that's only true if the pressure is allowed to change, which it isn't in this case.

Wait, perhaps the key is that the partial pressure of CO remains the same because the total pressure is maintained at 1 atm, but the mole fraction of CO decreases due to the addition of inert gas. So the system would shift to counteract this change.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck because I'm not certain about the reaction. Maybe I should consider the options given and think about which one makes sense. The initial amount of CO is 0.5 mol. If adding inert gas causes the system to shift to produce more CO, then the equilibrium amount of CO would be more than 0.5 mol. Looking at the options, B says 0.5 mol, which would mean no shift. But if the system shifts to the left to produce more CO, then the equilibrium amount would be higher than 0.5. So looking at the options, options C (2.88), D (2.0), E (0.75), F (1.5), G (1.88), H (2.38), J (3.00) are all higher than 0.5. So if the system shifts to the left, the amount of CO would increase.

Wait, but wait. If the reaction is 2 CO ⇌ C + O2, and we add inert gas, which increases the total pressure, the system would shift to the side with fewer moles of gas to reduce the pressure. The left side has 2 moles of CO, and the right has 1 mole of O2. So the system would shift to the right, producing more O2 and C, which would consume CO, thus decreasing the amount of CO at equilibrium.

Wait, that's the opposite of what I thought earlier. So if the system shifts to the right, CO is consumed, so the equilibrium amount of CO would be less than 0.5 mol.

Looking at the options, options A (0.24), I (0.10) are less than 0.5. So if the system shifts to the right, the equilibrium amount of CO would decrease.

But I'm not sure if the reaction is in that direction. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is CO ⇌ C + 0.5 O2. In that case, adding inert gas would increase the total pressure, shifting the equilibrium to the side with fewer moles of gas. The left side has 1 mole, and the right has 1.5 moles. So the system would shift to the left, producing more CO, thus increasing the equilibrium amount of CO.

Hmm, this is confusing. Maybe I should think about the effect of inert gas on the reaction quotient. The addition of inert gas doesn't change the partial pressures of the reacting gases, so the reaction quotient Q remains the same. Therefore, the system remains at equilibrium, and the amount of CO doesn't change. So the equilibrium amount remains 0.5 mol, which is option B.

Wait, but that contradicts my earlier reasoning. I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think again. The key point is that adding an inert gas at constant pressure doesn't change the partial pressures of the reacting gases because the total pressure remains the same, but the total moles increase. So the mole fractions of the reacting gases decrease, which can affect the reaction quotient.

Wait, but for a reaction where the number of moles changes, adding inert gas can shift the equilibrium. For example, if the reaction is A ⇌ B, and you add inert gas at constant pressure, the system will shift to the side with fewer moles to reduce pressure. But if the reaction is A ⇌ 2B, it would shift to the right.

In our case, suppose the reaction is CO(g) ⇌ C(s) + 0.5 O2(g). The left side has 1 mole, and the right has 1.5 moles. So adding inert gas at constant pressure would shift the equilibrium to the side with fewer moles, which is the left. Thus, more CO would be formed, so the equilibrium amount of CO would increase.

But without knowing the reaction, it's hard to be certain. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the inert gas doesn't affect the equilibrium because the partial pressures of CO and O2 remain the same. Wait, but that's only true if the pressure is allowed to change. Since the pressure is constant, adding inert gas changes the mole fractions, which affects the reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply that the amount of CO remains the same because the addition of inert gas doesn't affect the partial pressure of CO, so the equilibrium isn't shifted. Thus, the equilibrium amount of CO would still be 0.5 mol, which is option B.

But I'm not entirely confident. Let me think about the ideal gas law. The partial pressure of CO is (n_CO / n_total) * P_total. If we add inert gas, n_total increases, so the partial pressure of CO decreases. This would shift the equilibrium to the right if the reaction consumes CO. So depending on the reaction, the amount of CO could increase or decrease.

Wait, but without the reaction, I can't be sure. Maybe the problem is intended to test the understanding that adding an inert gas doesn't affect the partial pressures, so the equilibrium doesn't shift. Thus, the amount of CO remains 0.5 mol, which is option B.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the initial amount of CO is 0.5 mol, and the inert gas is 2.38 mol, but the reaction doesn't involve CO. Wait, that doesn't make sense. I'm getting stuck because I don't have the reaction equation.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about the dissociation of CO into C and O2, and the presence of inert gas affects the equilibrium. If the reaction is CO(g) ⇌ C(s) + 0.5 O2(g), then adding inert gas would decrease the partial pressure of CO, shifting the equilibrium to the right, thus decreasing the amount of CO.

In that case, the equilibrium amount of CO would be less than 0.5 mol. Looking at the options, option A is 0.24 mol, which is a significant decrease. Option I is 0.10 mol, which is even lower. But without knowing the value of K, it's hard to calculate the exact amount.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed so that the amount of CO remains the same because the inert gas doesn't participate in the reaction, and the partial pressure of CO remains unchanged. Thus, the equilibrium composition doesn't change, so the amount of CO is still 0.5 mol, option B.

But I'm not entirely sure. Another approach: perhaps the problem is that the addition of inert gas doesn't change the mole fractions of CO and O2, so the reaction quotient remains the same, and equilibrium isn't affected. Thus, the amount of CO remains 0.5 mol, option B.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the initial amount of CO is 0.5 mol, and the addition of inert gas at constant pressure causes the system to shift to the side with more moles of gas to reduce the pressure. For example, if the reaction is CO(g) ⇌ C(s) + 0.5 O2(g), the right side has 1.5 moles of gas, so the system would shift to the right, consuming CO and producing O2, thus decreasing the amount of CO at equilibrium.

In that case, the equilibrium amount of CO would be less than 0.5 mol. Looking at the options, option A is 0.24, which is a plausible decrease.

But again, without knowing the reaction, it's hard to be confident. Given the options, and considering that the problem mentions the effect of inert gas on equilibrium composition, perhaps the intended answer is that the amount of CO remains the same because the partial pressure doesn't change, so option B is correct.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Another angle: the problem states that the mixture is initially 0.5 mol CO and 2.38 mol air. Air is considered inert, so the total initial moles are 2.88. At equilibrium, the moles of CO would be x, and the moles of other gases would adjust accordingly. But without the reaction, I can't proceed.

Wait, perhaps the problem is simply about the total pressure and mole fractions. If the system is at 1 atm and 3000 K, and we add inert gas, the mole fraction of CO decreases. But the partial pressure of CO would be (x / (total moles)) * 1 atm. Without knowing the reaction, I can't determine x.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The problem gives the initial moles of CO as 0.5 and air as 2.38. The options suggest that the equilibrium amount of CO is one of the choices. Since the system is at 1 atm and 3000 K, perhaps the reaction is such that the amount of CO remains unchanged because the inert gas doesn't affect the partial pressure, so the equilibrium isn't shifted. Thus, the answer would be B: 0.5 mol of CO.

But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the addition of inert gas causes the system to shift, leading to a different amount of CO. For example, if the reaction is 2CO ⇌ C + O2, adding inert gas would shift it to the right, decreasing CO. So the equilibrium amount would be less than 0.5. The closest option below 0.5 is A: 0.24.

But I'm not sure. Another approach: perhaps the problem is about the effect of adding inert gas on the reaction quotient. The reaction quotient Q is based on partial pressures, which are (n_i / V) * R T. If inert gas is added, the volume changes to keep pressure constant, so n_total increases, but the partial pressures of CO and O2 would decrease. This would affect Q, causing the system to shift.

But without the reaction, I can't calculate it. Given the confusion, I'll go with the initial assumption that the amount of CO remains the same because the partial pressure doesn't change when inert gas is added at constant pressure. So the correct answer is B: 0.5 mol of CO.
</think>

The problem involves determining the equilibrium composition of a mixture containing 0.5 mol of CO and 2.38 mol of air (treated as inert) at 3000 K and 1 atm pressure. The key consideration is the effect of inert gas on the equilibrium composition. Inert gases do not participate in the reaction but can influence the system by altering the total pressure and mole fractions of the reacting gases.

Initially, the total moles of the mixture are 2.88 mol (0.5 mol CO + 2.38 mol air). At equilibrium, the composition depends on whether the partial pressures of CO and other gases change. Adding inert gas at constant pressure decreases the mole fraction of CO, which can shift the equilibrium depending on the reaction. However, without the exact reaction equation, it is challenging to determine the direction of the shift or the equilibrium constant.

If the reaction involves CO dissociating into C(s) and O2(g), adding inert gas would decrease the partial pressure of CO, potentially shifting the equilibrium to produce more CO. Conversely, if the reaction favors the production of CO, the equilibrium amount might remain unchanged. Given the options and the lack of specific reaction details, the simplest assumption is that the partial pressure of CO remains constant, and the equilibrium composition does not shift significantly. Thus, the amount of CO at equilibrium remains 0.5 mol.

**Answer: B**
