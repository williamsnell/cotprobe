Okay, so I have this problem about gas pressure in flasks when the temperature changes. Let me try to work through it step by step. 

The problem says there are two flasks of equal volume filled with nitrogen gas. Initially, both are immersed in boiling water, and the pressure is 0.5 atm. Then one flask is moved to an ice-water mixture, while the other stays in boiling water. I need to find the new pressure of the system.

Hmm, I remember that gas pressure depends on temperature when volume is constant. So this sounds like it's related to Gay-Lussac's Law, which states that pressure is directly proportional to temperature when volume is constant. The formula is P1/T1 = P2/T2, right?

Wait, but in this case, the volumes are the same for both flasks, but each is at a different temperature now. So I think I should model each flask separately and then combine their pressures since they are connected or part of the same system? Wait, no, the problem says "the gas pressure inside the system." So maybe the system is both flasks connected, or perhaps the pressure changes in each flask, and the total pressure is different. I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, maybe I should think of each flask as a separate system. Initially, both are at the same temperature (boiling water), so same pressure. Then when one is cooled and the other remains hot, their pressures will change, and assuming the system's volume is the sum or something? Wait, no, the flasks are of equal volume, but I'm not sure if they're connected. The problem says "the system," which could imply that the total pressure is the sum of the individual pressures, but maybe not, maybe each is a separate system. Oh wait, the initial pressure is 0.5 atm for both, so when they are connected, perhaps the pressure is the same in both. But now, when one is cooled and the other remains hot, the pressure in each changes, and the system's pressure would be the same throughout, but how?

Wait, perhaps the flasks are connected by a tube with a valve or something, so that the pressure equalizes. Or maybe the system is each flask, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the combined gas in both flasks, so the total pressure would be the sum of the partial pressures. Let me think.

Wait, the problem says "the gas pressure inside the system." So perhaps the system is each flask. Or perhaps the system is both together. I'm a bit confused. Let me try to parse the question again.

"Two flasks of equal volume are filled with nitrogen gas and, when both are immersed in boiling water, the gas pressure inside the system is 0.5 atm." So when both are at boiling water, each has pressure P, but since they're connected as a system, perhaps the total pressure is P. Wait, but if they're connected, maybe the pressure in each is the same. Alternatively, perhaps each is a separate system. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that both flasks are connected, so initially, they have the same pressure. Then, when one is cooled and the other remains hot, the pressure changes. So the system's pressure will adjust to a new value based on the temperatures of the two flasks.

Wait, no, that might not be the case. Alternatively, perhaps each flask is a separate container, and after changing the temperature of one, the pressure in each changes, and the system's total pressure is the sum of the two. But that depends on whether the flasks are connected. Hmm. The wording isn't clear. But the problem says "the gas pressure inside the system," which suggests that the system is the combined system of both flasks. So maybe the system's volume is double the volume of one flask, and the total moles would be double as well.

Wait, but initially, both are at the same temperature and pressure. So each has pressure P, volume V, temperature T. Then when one is cooled, its pressure changes, and the other remains at the same temperature, so pressure also changes. But no, wait—if each flask is separate, then each would have its own pressure after the temperature change. But the problem says "the system," so perhaps the total pressure is the sum of the pressures in each flask. Or perhaps the system's pressure is the same in both, and we have to find the new pressure when one is cooled.

I think perhaps the problem is that the two flasks are connected, so after the temperature change, the pressure equalizes between them. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe each is a separate system, so the pressure in each changes independently, and the system's pressure is the sum. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to model each flask separately. Let's assume that each flask is a separate system, so when one is cooled and the other remains at the original temperature, their pressures change, and the total pressure is the sum of the two, divided by the total volume. Or perhaps it's the same pressure in both because they're connected. I think I'm getting stuck on the setup.

Wait, maybe the system is each flask. So after the change, each has a new pressure, and the total pressure is the sum. Let me try that approach.

So initially, each flask has volume V, pressure P1 = 0.5 atm, and temperature T1 = boiling water, which is 100°C or 373.15 K.

When one flask is immersed in ice-water, T2 = 0°C = 273.15 K. The other remains at T1.

Assuming nitrogen gas, which is diatomic, so it's a gas, and we can use the ideal gas law.

Since the volume of each flask is constant, for each flask, P1 * V = n1 * R * T1.

After the temperature change, for the first flask (cooled), P2 * V = n2 * R * T2.

Similarly, for the second flask (still at boiling water), P3 * V = n3 * R * T1.

Wait, but the problem states "filled with nitrogen gas," so perhaps the number of moles is the same in each flask initially. Wait, but if the volume is the same and the pressure and temperature are the same, then yes, each has the same number of moles.

Wait, but if the flasks are separate, each with volume V, then the initial pressure is 0.5 atm in each, so for each, n = PV/(RT).

So when one is cooled, its pressure changes, and the other remains at the same temperature, so its pressure also changes? Or does it stay the same? Wait, no, because if each is a separate system, when one cools, its pressure changes, but the other remains at the same pressure because its temperature hasn't changed.

Wait, but the problem says "the gas pressure inside the system" after the change. So perhaps the system is each flask, so each has its own pressure. But the question is about the new pressure for the system, which might imply the combined system. I'm getting a bit stuck.

Alternatively, maybe the system is the combination of both flasks, so the total pressure is the sum of the pressures in each flask. But that would be if the flasks are connected and the volume is additive. Let me think.

Wait, initially, when both are at 100°C, each has pressure 0.5 atm, so if they're connected, the pressure would still be 0.5 atm because they're at the same temperature and pressure. But when one is cooled, the pressure in that one would drop, while the other remains the same. So the system's pressure would adjust.

Wait, perhaps I should model this using the combined gas law. Let me consider that the system's total volume is 2V (since each is V). But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the system's pressure is the same in both flasks after the change.

Wait, maybe the correct approach is to consider each flask as a separate container and calculate their individual pressures after the temperature change, then sum them if they are connected or take the average. But I'm not exactly sure.

Let me try working with the ideal gas law for each flask.

For Flask 1: Initially, P1 = 0.5 atm, V = V, T1 = 373.15 K.

After being cooled to 273.15 K, the pressure P1' is calculated using P1 * V = n * R * T1.

So n = (P1 * V) / (R * T1).

After cooling, T2 = 273.15 K.

P1' * V = n * R * T2.

Substituting n from above:

P1' * V = (P1 * V / (R T1)) ) * R T2.

Simplify: P1' = P1 * (T2 / T1) = 0.5 atm * (273.15 / 373.15).

Calculating that: 273.15 / 373.15 ≈ 0.732. So 0.5 * 0.732 ≈ 0.366 atm.

So Flask 1 now has pressure ≈0.366 atm.

Flask 2 remains at 373.15 K, so its pressure remains 0.5 atm, assuming no temperature change.

Wait, but if the system is the combination of both flasks, then the total pressure would be the sum of the two pressures divided by the total volume? Or perhaps the pressure is the same throughout, so we have to find a new pressure P such that the total moles are conserved.

Wait, perhaps I should model this as a combined system. Let me think of the two flasks as connected, so the total volume is 2V, and the total moles are n_total = n1 + n2.

Initially, each flask has n = (P_initial * V) / (R T_initial).

So n1_initial = n2_initial = n = (0.5 atm * V) / (R * 373.15 K).

Total moles initially: 2n.

After the change, Flask 1 is at T2 = 273.15 K, Flask 2 remains at T1 = 373.15 K.

Assuming the system's total volume is 2V, but each part is at different temperatures. Hmm, but that's not possible with the ideal gas law because pressure and temperature are uniform in each part if connected. Wait, no, if they are at different temperatures, the pressure can vary, but in reality, if they're connected, the pressure must be the same throughout. So perhaps that's the case.

Wait, that makes more sense. So if the two flasks are connected, the pressure throughout the system must be the same. So when one part is cooled, the pressure would adjust to a new value that's lower than 0.5 atm.

So let's model this as a combined system with volume 2V, and find the new pressure P after Flask 1 is cooled to 0°C and Flask 2 remains at 100°C.

Wait, but that might not be correct because each part is at a different temperature. Hmm, perhaps I should model it as two separate containers at different temperatures but same pressure.

Wait, but in reality, if two containers are connected, the pressure must be the same. So each part must be at the same pressure, but different temperatures. So the ideal gas law for each part would be:

For Flask 1 (cooled to 0°C): P * V = n1 * R * T2.

For Flask 2 (still at 100°C): P * V = n2 * R * T1.

The total moles in the system would be n1 + n2 = (P V)/(R T2) + (P V)/(R T1).

The total volume is 2V, and the initial total moles were 2n, where n = (0.5 atm * V)/(R * T1).

So initial moles: 2 * [0.5 V / (R T1)] = V/(R T1).

After the change, total moles = P V/(R T2) + P V/(R T1) = P V (1/(R T2) + 1/(R T1)) ) = P V (1/R)(1/T2 + 1/T1) ).

Since the number of moles doesn't change (assuming no gas escapes), we have:

V/(R T1) = P V (1/R)(1/T2 + 1/T1).

Simplify:

1/(T1) = P (1/T2 + 1/T1).

Multiply both sides by T1 T2:

T2 = P (T1 + T2).

So P = T2 / (T1 + T2).

Wait, that seems interesting. Let me plug in the numbers.

T1 = 373.15 K, T2 = 273.15 K.

P = 273.15 / (373.15 + 273.15) = 273.15 / 646.3 ≈ 0.423 atm.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.423 atm. So that's the answer.
</think>

The problem involves two flasks of equal volume filled with nitrogen gas, initially at 0.5 atm pressure when both are immersed in boiling water (373.15 K). One flask is then cooled to an ice-water mixture (273.15 K), while the other remains at boiling water temperature. The goal is to calculate the new pressure of the system.

Using the ideal gas law and the principle that the total number of moles of gas remains constant, the system's pressure can be determined by considering the combined moles in both flasks. Initially, each flask has the same number of moles, and the total moles are conserved after the temperature change. The pressure adjusts to a new value that satisfies the ideal gas law for both flasks at their respective temperatures.

The final pressure is calculated as:

\[
P = \frac{T_2}{T_1 + T_2}
\]

Substituting \( T_1 = 373.15 \, \text{K} \) and \( T_2 = 273.15 \, \text{K} \):

\[
P = \frac{273.15}{373.15 + 273.15} = \frac{273.15}{646.3} \approx 0.423 \, \text{atm}.
\]

Thus, the new pressure of the system is **0.423 atm**.
