Question:

Algae may be microscopic single-celled organisms or enormousmulticellularseaweeds hundreds of feet long. The body of one of these organisms is termed athallus. How does athallusdiffer from a plant body?

Options:

A: A plant body shows differentiation of parts, with its roots, stems, and leaves all varying greatly in structure and in function. Multicellular algae show very little, if any, tissue differentiation.
B: Algae have a more complex structure than plants
C: A thallus has a rigid cell wall made of cellulose, which is absent in plant cells
D: A thallus consists of a single layer of cells, unlike the multilayered tissues of plants
E: Algae possess true flowers and seeds, which differentiates them from plants
F: Algae cells are much smaller than plant cells
G: Algae have vascular systems similar to plants for transporting nutrients
H: Algae bodies are typically organized into root-like, stem-like, and leaf-like structures
I: Algae are capable of photosynthesis while plants are not
J: Algae perform cellular respiration, while plants only perform photosynthesis

Okay, so I have this question about algae and how their body, called a thallus, differs from a plant body. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step. Let's see what I remember from my biology classes.

First, the question starts by saying that algae can be microscopic single-celled organisms or huge multicellular seaweeds. So, they come in different forms, but all of them are classified as algae. The body of these organisms is called a thallus. Now, I need to compare this thallus to a plant body.

I remember that plants have a specific structure: roots, stems, and leaves. Each part has different functions. For example, roots absorb water and minerals, stems transport these nutrients and support the plant, and leaves are where photosynthesis happens. So, plants have a high degree of organ differentiation.

On the other hand, algae, especially the multicellular ones like seaweeds, don't have this same level of differentiation. I think some algae have structures that might look like stems or leaves, but they aren't the same as in plants. Maybe they have holdfasts, stipes, and blades, but these aren't true roots, stems, or leaves. So, the thallus isn't organized into distinct roots, stems, and leaves like a plant's body is.

Looking at the options:

Option A says that a plant body has differentiation of parts like roots, stems, and leaves, which vary in structure and function. Multicellular algae show very little tissue differentiation. That sounds right. Because plants have these specialized organs, while algae might not have such a clear division.

Option B says algae have a more complex structure than plants. I don't think that's correct because plants are more complex with their organ systems.

Option C talks about a rigid cell wall made of cellulose. Both plants and algae have cell walls made of cellulose, so this isn't a difference.

Option D mentions a single layer of cells versus multiple layers. Some algae might be multicellular, but I don't think it's necessarily just a single layer. Also, plants have multiple layers, so this might not be the main difference.

Option E says algae have true flowers and seeds. No, plants have flowers and seeds. Algae reproduce via spores, so this is incorrect.

Option F claims algae cells are smaller. I don't think cell size is the main distinguishing factor here.

Option G says algae have vascular systems like plants. No, most algae lack vascular tissues. Plants have xylem and phloem, which algae don't, so G is wrong.

Option H says thallus is organized into root-like, stem-like, and leaf-like structures. Wait, but the question is about how they differ. If algae have these structures but they aren't true organs, then H might be describing the algae's structure, not the difference. But the question is about how thallus differs from plant body. So maybe H is incorrect because plants have true differentiation, whereas algae don't. So H might not be the right answer.

Option I says algae can photosynthesize and plants can't. No, both do photosynthesis, so I is wrong.

Option J says algae do cellular respiration, plants only photosynthesis. No, plants do both, so J is incorrect.

So putting it together, the key difference is the differentiation of parts. Plants have specialized organs, while algae's thallus doesn't. So the correct answer should be A.

The correct answer is A. Plants exhibit a higher degree of organ differentiation with roots, stems, and leaves, each serving distinct functions. In contrast, multicellular algae, such as seaweeds, lack this level of differentiation. Their body, the thallus, does not organize into true roots, stems, or leaves, distinguishing them from plants.

Answer: A
