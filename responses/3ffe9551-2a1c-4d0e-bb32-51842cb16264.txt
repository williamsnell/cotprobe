Okay, so I've got this problem to compute the area of a part of a helicoid. The helicoid is given by z = arctan(y/x), and I'm looking at the part that's in the first octant between two cylinders: x² + y² = 1² and x² + y² = 2². Hmm, alright. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I remember that the area of a surface given by z = f(x, y) can be found using a surface integral. The formula for the surface area is the double integral over the region D of the square root of (f_x² + f_y² + 1) dA. So I need to find the partial derivatives of z with respect to x and y.

Let me compute f_x and f_y. So, z = arctan(y/x). The partial derivative with respect to x would be: using the chain rule, the derivative of arctan(u) is (1/(1 + u²)) * du/dx. Here, u = y/x, so du/dx is -y/x². So f_x = (1/(1 + (y/x)²)) * (-y/x²) = (-y)/(x² + y²). Similarly, for f_y, the derivative with respect to y, u = y/x, so du/dy is 1/x. Thus, f_y = (1/(1 + (y/x)²)) * (1/x) = x/(x² + y²).

So, f_x² is [y²/(x² + y²)²], and f_y² is [x²/(x² + y²)²]. Adding these together: (y² + x²)/(x² + y²)^2 = (x² + y²)/(x² + y²)^2 = 1/(x² + y²). So the integrand becomes sqrt(1/(x² + y²) + 1). Wait, no, wait. The formula is sqrt(f_x² + f_y² + 1). Wait, no, wait. Let me correct that. The surface area element is sqrt( (f_x)^2 + (f_y)^2 + 1 ). So f_x² + f_y² is [y² + x²]/(x² + y²)^2, which simplifies to 1/(x² + y²). So adding 1, we have 1/(x² + y²) + 1 = (1 + x² + y²)/(x² + y²) = (x² + y² + 1)/(x² + y²). Hmm, that seems a bit complicated. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the expression.

Wait, let me recheck. The surface area element is sqrt( (dz/dx)^2 + (dz/dy)^2 + 1 ). Wait, no, no, wait. No, actually, the formula is sqrt( (dz/dx)^2 + (dz/dy)^2 + 1 ). Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, no, wait. The correct formula is sqrt( (dz/dx)^2 + (dz/dy)^2 + 1 ), no, wait, no. Wait, no, I think I'm confusing the formula. Let me recall: for a surface z = f(x, y), the surface area element is sqrt( (f_x)^2 + (f_y)^2 + 1 ) dx dy. So yes, that's correct.

So, f_x and f_y are as I computed. So f_x² + f_y² is [y² + x²]/(x² + y²)^2, which is 1/(x² + y²). So adding 1 gives 1/(x² + y²) + 1 = (1 + x² + y²)/(x² + y²). So sqrt of that is sqrt( (1 + x² + y²)/(x² + y²) ). That's the integrand.

Wait, but maybe I can simplify this. Let me see: (1 + x² + y²)/(x² + y²) = (x² + y² + 1)/(x² + y²) = 1 + 1/(x² + y²). Hmm, not sure if that helps much.

Alternatively, maybe using polar coordinates would be better here, since the region is between two cylinders, which are circles in the xy-plane. So x² + y² = r² in polar coordinates. So perhaps switching to polar coordinates would help.

So, in polar coordinates, x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ, so z = arctan( (r sinθ)/(r cosθ) ) = arctan(tanθ) = θ, since θ is between 0 and π/2 because we're in the first octant. Wait, but arctan(y/x) is θ in the first quadrant, yes.

So, the surface is z = θ, but that's only when x and y are positive, which they are in the first octant.

Wait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about parameterizing the surface. Alternatively, perhaps using a parameterization in terms of r and θ, since the region is circular.

Let me try parameterizing the surface using r and θ, where r goes from 1 to 2 (since between x² + y² = 1 and 2), and θ goes from 0 to π/2 because it's the first octant.

So, the parameterization would be:

x = r cosθ,

y = r sinθ,

z = arctan(y/x) = arctan( (r sinθ)/(r cosθ) ) = arctan(tanθ) = θ, because θ is in [0, π/2), so arctan(tanθ) = θ.

So, the parameterization is r(θ, r) = (r cosθ, r sinθ, θ), where r ∈ [1,2], θ ∈ [0, π/2].

Wait, actually, in parameterizing surfaces, we usually use two parameters, say u and v, but here I'm using r and θ, which correspond to the polar coordinates. Alternatively, I can compute the surface area using the parameterization.

The formula for the surface area when parameterizing with u and v is the double integral over the parameters of |r_u × r_v| du dv.

So, let's compute the partial derivatives of the parameterization with respect to r and θ.

First, the parameterization in terms of r and θ is:

x = r cosθ,

y = r sinθ,

z = θ.

So, compute r_r (partial derivative with respect to r):

dr/dr = (cosθ, sinθ, 0).

Then, compute r_θ (partial derivative with respect to θ):

dr/dθ = (-r sinθ, r cosθ, 1).

Now, compute the cross product of r_r and r_θ.

The cross product is:

|i     j     k|
|cosθ sinθ 0|
|-r sinθ r cosθ 1|

So, determinant:

i*(sinθ*1 - 0*r cosθ) - j*(cosθ*1 - 0*(-r sinθ)) + k*(cosθ*r cosθ - (-r sinθ)*sinθ).

Simplify each component:

i component: sinθ * 1 = sinθ.

j component: -(cosθ * 1) = -cosθ.

k component: cosθ * r cosθ + r sinθ * sinθ = r cos²θ + r sin²θ = r (cos²θ + sin²θ) = r.

So, the cross product is (sinθ, -cosθ, r).

The magnitude of this cross product is sqrt( (sinθ)^2 + (-cosθ)^2 + r^2 ) = sqrt( sin²θ + cos²θ + r² ) = sqrt(1 + r²).

So, the surface area element dS is |r_r × r_θ| dr dθ = sqrt(1 + r²) dr dθ.

Therefore, the area is the integral over θ from 0 to π/2 and r from 1 to 2 of sqrt(1 + r²) dr dθ.

Since the integrand doesn't depend on θ, we can separate the integrals.

So, Area = ∫ (θ=0 to π/2) [ ∫ (r=1 to 2) sqrt(1 + r²) dr ] dθ.

The integral over θ is just π/2, because the integrand is 1 with respect to θ from 0 to π/2. So, Area = (π/2) * ∫ (r=1 to 2) sqrt(1 + r²) dr.

Now, compute the integral ∫ sqrt(1 + r²) dr from 1 to 2.

Let me recall that ∫ sqrt(r² + a²) dr = (r/2) sqrt(r² + a²) + (a²/2) ln(r + sqrt(r² + a²))) ) + C, where a is a constant. Here, a = 1, so:

∫ sqrt(r² + 1) dr = (r/2) sqrt(r² + 1) + (1/2) ln(r + sqrt(r² + 1)) ) + C.

Evaluate this from 1 to 2.

At r=2:

(2/2) sqrt(4 + 1) + (1/2) ln(2 + sqrt(5)) = (1) sqrt(5) + (1/2) ln(2 + sqrt(5)).

At r=1:

(1/2) sqrt(2) + (1/2) ln(1 + sqrt(2)).

So, the definite integral from 1 to 2 is [sqrt(5) + (1/2) ln(2 + sqrt(5))] - [ (sqrt(2)/2) + (1/2) ln(1 + sqrt(2)) ) ].

Simplify this:

sqrt(5) - sqrt(2)/2 + (1/2)[ ln(2 + sqrt(5)) - ln(1 + sqrt(2)) ].

But perhaps it's better to compute numerically.

Compute each part:

Compute sqrt(5): approx 2.23607.

Compute sqrt(2)/2: approx 1.41421 / 2 ≈ 0.707105.

Compute ln(2 + sqrt(5)): 2 + sqrt(5) ≈ 2 + 2.23607 ≈ 4.23607. ln(4.23607) ≈ 1.4436.

Compute ln(1 + sqrt(2)): 1 + 1.41421 ≈ 2.41421. ln(2.41421) ≈ 0.88137.

So, the integral from 1 to 2 is:

(2.23607 - 0.707105) + (0.5)(1.4436 - 0.88137) = (1.528965) + (0.5)(0.56223) ≈ 1.528965 + 0.281115 ≈ 1.81008.

Wait, but wait, that can't be right because the integral of sqrt(r² +1) from 1 to 2 is definitely larger than that. Wait, perhaps I messed up the signs.

Wait, the integral is [sqrt(5) - sqrt(2)/2] + (1/2)[ln(2 + sqrt(5)) - ln(1 + sqrt(2))].

Compute sqrt(5) ≈ 2.23607, sqrt(2)/2 ≈ 0.707105. So sqrt(5) - sqrt(2)/2 ≈ 2.23607 - 0.707105 ≈ 1.528965.

Then, ln(2 + sqrt(5)) ≈ ln(4.23607) ≈ 1.4436, ln(1 + sqrt(2)) ≈ ln(2.41421) ≈ 0.88137.

So, the difference is 1.4436 - 0.88137 ≈ 0.56223.

Multiply by 1/2: 0.56223 * 0.5 ≈ 0.281115.

Add to the previous part: 1.528965 + 0.281115 ≈ 1.81008.

So the integral ∫ from 1 to 2 of sqrt(r² +1) dr ≈ 1.81008.

Then, the area is (π/2) * 1.81008.

Compute π/2 ≈ 1.5708.

Multiply by 1.81008: 1.5708 * 1.81008 ≈ Let's compute 1.5708 * 1.8 ≈ 2.82744, but more accurately:

1.5708 * 1.81008 ≈ Let me compute 1.5708 * 1.8 = 2.82744, plus 1.5708 * 0.01008 ≈ 0.01584. So total ≈ 2.82744 + 0.01584 ≈ 2.84328.

So the area is approximately 2.843.

Looking at the options, option C is 2.843. So I think the answer is C.

The problem requires computing the area of a helicoid defined by \( z = \arctan(y/x) \) within the first octant between the cylinders \( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \) and \( x^2 + y^2 = 2 \). 

To solve this, we parameterize the surface using polar coordinates \( (r, \theta) \), where \( r \) ranges from 1 to 2 and \( \theta \) ranges from 0 to \( \pi/2 \). The parameterization is:

\[
x = r \cos\theta, \quad y = r \sin\theta, \quad z = \theta.
\]

The partial derivatives of the parameterization are computed, and the cross product of these derivatives yields a magnitude of \( \sqrt{1 + r^2} \). The surface area integral is then set up as:

\[
\text{Area} = \int_{0}^{\pi/2} \int_{1}^{2} \sqrt{1 + r^2} \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The integral over \( \theta \) is straightforward, yielding \( \pi/2 \). The radial integral \( \int_{1}^{2} \sqrt{1 + r^2} \, dr \) is evaluated numerically, resulting in approximately 1.81008. Multiplying this by \( \pi/2 \) gives the total area as approximately 2.843.

Thus, the correct answer is:

C: 2.843
