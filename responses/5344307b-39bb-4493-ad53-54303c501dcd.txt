Okay, so I've got this problem here about Fei Yen's dog and the dog food. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

Alright, the question says Fei Yen's dog eats 8 ounces each day. She bought a 28-pound bag of dog food. They're asking how many 8-ounce servings are in that 28-pound bag. Hmm, sounds like a unit conversion problem.

First, I need to convert pounds to ounces because the serving size is in ounces. I remember that 1 pound is equal to 16 ounces. So, if the bag is 28 pounds, I can multiply 28 by 16 to find out how many ounces are in the bag.

Let me do that calculation: 28 times 16. Let's see, 20 times 16 is 320, and 8 times 16 is 128. Adding those together, 320 plus 128 equals 448 ounces. So, the bag has 448 ounces of dog food.

Now, each serving is 8 ounces. To find out how many servings are in the bag, I should divide the total ounces by the serving size. That means 448 divided by 8.

Let me calculate that: 448 ÷ 8. Well, 8 times 50 is 400, and 8 times 6 is 48, so 50 plus 6 is 56. So, 448 divided by 8 is 56. That means there are 56 servings of 8 ounces each in the 28-pound bag.

Looking at the options, G is 56. So the answer should be G.

The 28-pound bag converts to 448 ounces, and dividing by 8 ounces per serving gives 56 servings.

Answer: G
