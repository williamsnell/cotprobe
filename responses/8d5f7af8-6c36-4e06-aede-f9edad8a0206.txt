Question:

This question refers to the following information.
First we must remark that the cosmos is spherical in form, partly because this form being a perfect whole requiring no joints, is the most complete of all, partly because it makes the most capacious form, which is best suited to contain and preserve everything; or again because all the constituent parts of the universe, that is the sun, moon and the planets appear in this form; or because everything strives to attain this form, as appears in the case of drops of water and other fluid bodies if they attempt to define themselves. So no one will doubt that this form belongs to the heavenly bodies. …
That the earth is also spherical is therefore beyond question, because it presses from all sides upon its center. Although by reason of the elevations of the mountains and the depressions of the valleys a perfect circle cannot be understood, yet this does not affect the general spherical nature of the earth. …
As it has been already shown that the earth has the form of a sphere, we must consider whether a movement also coincides with this form, and what place the earth holds in the universe. … The great majority of authors of course agree that the earth stands still in the center of the universe, and consider it inconceivable and ridiculous to suppose the opposite. But if the matter is carefully weighed, it will be seen that the question is not yet settled and therefore by no means to be regarded lightly. Every change of place which is observed is due, namely, to a movement of the observed object or of the observer, or to movements of both. … Now it is from the earth that the revolution of the heavens is observed and it is produced for our eyes. Therefore if the earth undergoes no movement this movement must take place in everything outside of the earth, but in the opposite direction than if everything on the earth moved, and of this kind is the daily revolution. So this appears to affect the whole universe, that is, everything outside the earth with the single exception of the earth itself. If, however, one should admit that this movement was not peculiar to the heavens, but that the earth revolved from west to east, and if this was carefully considered in regard to the apparent rising and setting of the sun, the moon and the stars, it would be discovered that this was the real situation."

Okay, so I need to figure out which tradition Copernicus was working in based on the passage provided. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the passage is from Copernicus's "The Revolutions of the Heavenly Bodies," written in 1543. The passage talks about the Earth being spherical and its position in the universe. It also discusses whether the Earth moves or not, and how that affects our observations of the heavens.

Looking at the options, the possible traditions include Ptolemaic, skeptical, Stoic, Aristotelian, Platonic/Pythagorean, observational, Cartesian, heliocentric, empirical, and natural magic.

Copernicus's work is famous for proposing a heliocentric model, which states that the Earth and other planets revolve around the Sun. This goes against the geocentric model of Ptolemy, where the Earth was at the center. So, if he's arguing against the Earth being the center, he's moving away from the Ptolemaic tradition (option A). That makes me think option H (heliocentric tradition) is a strong possibility.

But let me think about the other options. The passage mentions that the Earth is spherical because it's observed to press from all sides and that the irregularities like mountains and valleys don't change its overall spherical nature. This seems like an observational approach, so maybe the observational tradition (F) is a contender. However, while observations are important, Copernicus's main contribution was the heliocentric model, so F might not be the best fit.

The passage also talks about whether the Earth moves or not, and how that affects the observed movement of the heavens. He's considering the possibility that the Earth's movement explains the apparent motion of the stars and planets. This is a key point in the heliocentric theory, so again pointing towards option H.

Looking at other traditions: the Ptolemaic tradition is geocentric, so Copernicus is against that. The Skeptical tradition is about doubting accepted knowledge, but the passage doesn't seem to focus on skepticism. The Stoic tradition is more about ethics and cosmology, not sure if that's relevant here. The Aristotelian tradition is also geocentric and supports a different model, so probably not. The Platonic/Pythagorean tradition does have some ideas about cosmic order, but heliocentrism is more directly associated with Copernicus. The Cartesian tradition is later, involving Descartes, so not applicable here. The empirical tradition relies on experiments and data, which Copernicus used, but his work is more about the model itself, so maybe not the best fit. The natural magic tradition is about occult phenomena, which doesn't seem related.

So, putting it all together, Copernicus was part of the heliocentric tradition because he proposed that the Earth moves around the Sun, which is the defining feature of that tradition. Therefore, the answer should be H.

H

The passage discusses Copernicus's argument for the Earth's movement and its spherical nature, leading to the conclusion that he was working within the heliocentric tradition.

Answer: H
