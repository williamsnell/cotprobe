Okay, so I have this problem about finding the enthalpy change (ΔH') for CCl4 based on its vapor pressure at two different temperatures. Hmm, I remember that vapor pressure is related to temperature and enthalpy change through the Clausius-Clapeyron equation. Let me try to recall how that works.

The Clausius-Clapeyron equation is used to relate the change in vapor pressure (ln(P2/P1)) to the change in temperature (1/T2 - 1/T1) and the enthalpy of vaporization (ΔH'). The equation is usually written as:

ln(P2/P1) = (ΔH')/R * (1/T1 - 1/T2) / (1)

Wait, wait, no. I think I might have mixed up the signs. Let me think again. The correct form is:

ln(P2/P1) = -(ΔH')/R * (1/T2 - 1/T1)

Because vapor pressure increases with temperature if the process is endothermic, which it is for vaporization. So the equation should account for that.

Given that, I have P2 as 0.526 atm at T2 = 58°C, and P1 as 0.132 atm at T1 = 23°C. Oh wait, but temperature should be in Kelvin. So I need to convert those temperatures.

T1 = 23 + 273.15 = 296.15 K
T2 = 58 + 273.15 = 331.15 K

Now, plug into the equation:

ln(0.526/0.132) = -(ΔH')/R * (1/331.15 - 1/296.15)

Wait, no. Because P2 is higher than P1, and T2 is higher than T1, so when I take P2/P1, it's greater than 1, so ln of that is positive. The right side should be negative times (1/T2 - 1/T1), which would make it positive because (1/T2 - 1/T1) is negative since T2 > T1.

Let me compute the left side first:

ln(0.526 / 0.132) = ln(4.0) approximately. Because 0.526 ÷ 0.132 is roughly 4. So ln(4) is about 1.386.

Now, the denominator on the right side is R, which I think is 8.314 J/(mol·K). Let me confirm that R is 8.314.

So, rearranging the equation to solve for ΔH':

ΔH' = -(R) * (ln(P2/P1)) / (1/T2 - 1/T1)

Wait, no, let's make sure. Let me write the equation again.

ln(P2/P1) = -(ΔH')/R * (1/T2 - 1/T1)

Multiply both sides by R:

R * ln(P2/P1) = -(ΔH') (1/T2 - 1/T1)

Then, multiply both sides by -1:

- R * ln(P2/P1) = ΔH' (1/T2 - 1/T1)

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me double-check. Oh wait, no, I think I messed up the rearrangement. Let me go back.

Starting from:

ln(P2/P1) = (ΔH')/R * (1/T1 - 1/T2)

Because the equation is ln(P2/P1) = (ΔH')/R (1/T1 - 1/T2), right? Because when T increases, 1/T decreases, so the right side should be positive if ΔH' is positive (since vaporization is endothermic). So perhaps I should write it as:

ln(P2/P1) = (ΔH')/R (1/T1 - 1/T2)

So, solving for ΔH':

ΔH' = [ln(P2/P1) * R] / (1/T1 - 1/T2)

Wait, that makes more sense. Because if T2 > T1, then 1/T1 > 1/T2, so denominator is positive, and ln(P2/P1) is positive, so ΔH' is positive, which is correct because vaporization is endothermic.

So, let's compute each part.

First, calculate ln(P2/P1):

P2 = 0.526 atm, P1 = 0.132 atm.

P2/P1 = 0.526 / 0.132 ≈ 4.0 (exactly, 0.526 ÷ 0.132 is approximately 4.0, but let me compute it accurately: 0.526 ÷ 0.132 = 4.0 exactly? Wait, 0.132 * 4 = 0.528, which is a bit higher than 0.526, so it's actually about 3.985, so ln(3.985) is approximately 1.384.

Wait, maybe I should compute it more accurately. Let me compute 0.526 ÷ 0.132.

0.132 × 3.98 = ?

0.132 × 3 = 0.396

0.132 × 0.98 = approx 0.12936

So total is 0.396 + 0.12936 = 0.52536, which is very close to 0.526. So 3.98 is roughly 3.98, so ln(3.98) ≈ 1.384.

Alternatively, using a calculator approach: ln(4) is about 1.386, so maybe 1.384 is close enough.

Next, compute the denominator: (1/T1 - 1/T2)

T1 = 296.15 K, T2 = 331.15 K.

1/T1 ≈ 1/296.15 ≈ 0.003377 K^-1

1/T2 ≈ 1/331.15 ≈ 0.003020 K^-1

So 1/T1 - 1/T2 = 0.003377 - 0.003020 = 0.000357 K^-1

Now, plug into the equation:

ΔH' = [ln(P2/P1) * R] / (1/T1 - 1/T2)

Which is:

ΔH' = (1.384 * 8.314) / 0.000357

First, compute 1.384 * 8.314:

Let me compute 1 *8.314 = 8.314

0.384 *8.314 ≈ 3.185 (since 0.3 *8.314=2.494, 0.08*8.314=0.665, 0.004*8.314≈0.033; adding 2.494 +0.665=3.159 +0.033=3.192)

So total is approx 8.314 +3.192 ≈ 11.506 J/(mol·K)

Wait, wait, no. Because 1.384 is 1 + 0.384, so 1 *8.314 =8.314, 0.384 *8.314 = let's compute:

0.3 *8.314=2.4942

0.08 *8.314=0.66512

0.004 *8.314=0.033256

Adding those: 2.4942 +0.66512 =3.15932 +0.033256=3.192576

So total is 8.314 +3.192576 ≈ 11.506576 J/(mol·K)

Now, divide by 0.000357 K^-1:

11.506576 / 0.000357 ≈ ?

Let me compute 11.506576 ÷ 0.000357.

0.000357 is 3.57e-4.

So 11.506576 ÷ 3.57e-4 = 11.506576 / 0.000357 ≈ ?

Let me compute this division:

0.000357 × 32,200 ≈ 11.4954 (because 35,700 * 0.000357 would be 35,700 * 3.57e-4 = 12.7089, but I think I need a better approach.

Alternatively, let's compute 11.506576 / 0.000357.

It's the same as 11.506576 * (1 / 0.000357) ≈ 11.506576 * 2803.36 ≈ ?

Wait, because 1/0.000357 ≈ 2803.36.

So 11.506576 * 2803.36 ≈ ?

Let me compute 11.5 * 2800 = 32,200.

But more accurately: 11.506576 * 2803.36 ≈ ?

Let me compute 11 * 2803.36 = 30,837. 0.506576 *2803.36 ≈ 1,418. So total is approx 30,837 +1,418 = 32,255 J/mol.

Wait, but perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me check with a calculator approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute 11.506576 ÷ 0.000357:

Let me write both numbers in scientific notation.

11.506576 = 1.1506576 ×10^1

0.000357 =3.57 ×10^-4

So 1.1506576e1 / 3.57e-4 = (1.1506576 / 3.57) × 10^5

1.1506576 ÷3.57 ≈ 0.3223

So 0.3223 ×1e5 =32,230 J/mol, approximately.

Wait, that's about 32,230 J/mol, which is approximately 32,230 J/mol.

Looking at the options, option I is 32,000 J/mol. So that's close.

Wait, but let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps using more precise values would give a better approximation.

Wait, ln(0.526/0.132) is ln(4.0) exactly? Let me compute 0.526 ÷0.132 more precisely.

0.132 ×3 =0.396

0.132 ×3.98 =0.132*(4 -0.02)=0.528 -0.00264=0.52536

But 0.526 is a bit higher than 0.52536, so 3.98 ×0.132=0.52536, so 0.526 would be 3.98 + (0.526-0.52536)/0.132 = 3.98 + (0.00064)/0.132 ≈3.98 +0.004848≈3.984848.

So ln(3.984848) ≈1.384.

But perhaps a more accurate value using a calculator: ln(3.984848) is approximately 1.384.

So the numerator is 1.384 *8.314 ≈11.506.

Denominator is (1/296.15 - 1/331.15) = (0.003377 -0.003020)=0.000357.

So 11.506 /0.000357 ≈32,230 J/mol.

So the closest option is I:32,000 J/mol.

Wait, but looking at the options, option I is 32,000.

Alternatively, maybe I should double-check the calculation steps for any errors.

Another approach: perhaps using the exact values without approximations.

Compute ln(P2/P1):

P2=0.526, P1=0.132.

P2/P1=0.526/0.132=4.0 exactly? Let me compute 0.132 ×4=0.528, which is higher than 0.526, so it's actually 4 - (0.528-0.526)/0.132=4 - 0.002/0.132≈3.9931, so ln(3.9931)=?

Using a calculator, ln(3.9931)= approximately 1.385.

R=8.314 J/(mol·K)

Denominator: (1/296.15 -1/331.15) = (1/296.15 -1/331.15)=?

Compute 1/296.15=0.003377 K^-1

1/331.15=0.003020 K^-1

So 0.003377 -0.003020=0.000357 K^-1

Now, ΔH' = (1.385 *8.314)/0.000357

Compute numerator:1.385 *8.314=?

8 *1.385=11.08

0.314 *1.385= approx 0.434

So total ≈11.08 +0.434=11.514 J/(mol·K)

Now, 11.514 /0.000357=?

11.514 ÷0.000357 = let's compute 11.514 /0.000357.

Multiply numerator and denominator by 1e6 to eliminate decimals: 11,514,000 /357 ≈?

Compute 357 ×32,270=?

357 ×32,270: Let's compute 357 ×32,000=11,424,000

357 ×270=96,390

Total 11,424,000 +96,390=11,520,390.

But our numerator is 11,514,000, which is a bit less than 32,270.

So 32,270 ×357=11,520,390.

We have 11,514,000, which is 6,390 less.

So 6,390 /357 ≈18.

So approximately 32,270 -18=32,252 J/mol.

Which is about 32,250 J/mol, which rounds to 32,000 J/mol, matching option I.

Wait, but looking at the options, I is 32,000, but another option is H:28,000, which is lower. Did I make a mistake in the equation setup?

Wait, another possibility: maybe I used the wrong form of the Clausius-Clapeyron equation. Let me think again.

The correct form is:

ln(P2/P1) = (ΔH')/R (1/T1 - 1/T2) [since vaporization is endothermic, ΔH' is positive, and as T increases, P increases, so the right side should be positive, which is achieved if (1/T1 -1/T2) is positive, which it is because T1 < T2.]

So the equation is correct as I used.

Wait, but perhaps I should consider that R is 8.314 J/(mol·K), which is correct.

So the calculation seems correct, leading to ΔH' ≈32,000 J/mol, which is option I.

But wait, looking at the options, option I is 32,000 J/mol. So that's the answer.
</think>

To determine the enthalpy change (ΔH') for the vaporization of CCl₄ between 23°C and 58°C, the Clausius-Clapeyron equation is used:

\[
\ln\left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right) = \frac{\Delta H'}{R} \left(\frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_2}\right)
\]

### Given Data:
- \( P_1 = 0.132 \, \text{atm} \) at \( T_1 = 23^\circ \text{C} = 296.15 \, \text{K} \)
- \( P_2 = 0.526 \, \text{atm} \) at \( T_2 = 58^\circ \text{C} = 331.15 \, \text{K} \)
- \( R = 8.314 \, \text{J/(mol·K)} \)

### Step 1: Calculate \( \ln(P_2/P_1) \)
\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \frac{0.526}{0.132} \approx 4.0
\]
\[
\ln(4.0) \approx 1.386
\]

### Step 2: Calculate \( \frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_2} \)
\[
\frac{1}{T_1} = \frac{1}{296.15} \approx 0.003377 \, \text{K}^{-1}
\]
\[
\frac{1}{T_2} = \frac{1}{331.15} \approx 0.003020 \, \text{K}^{-1}
\]
\[
\frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_2} = 0.003377 - 0.003020 = 0.000357 \, \text{K}^{-1}
\]

### Step 3: Solve for \( \Delta H' \)
Rearranging the Clausius-Clapeyron equation:
\[
\Delta H' = \frac{\ln(P_2/P_1) \cdot R}{\frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_2}}
\]
\[
\Delta H' = \frac{1.386 \cdot 8.314}{0.000357}
\]
\[
\Delta H' \approx \frac{11.506}{0.000357} \approx 32,250 \, \text{J/mol}
\]

### Step 4: Match with the closest option
The calculated value of \( \Delta H' \) is approximately \( 32,250 \, \text{J/mol} \), which corresponds to option **I: 32,000 J/mol**.

**Answer: I**
