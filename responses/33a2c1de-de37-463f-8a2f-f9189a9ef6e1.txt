Question:

A city entered into a small-cost construction contract with a construction company whereby the latter obligated themselves to perform certain minor sewer repair work. Two months after completion of the work, the company sued the city for its failure to pay under the terms of the contract. At trial, the company's construction supervisor who personally oversaw all the repair work was called to testify. He sought to testify about the amount of sewer pipe used, the number of hours required to complete the job, and the number of workers employed by the company during the construction repair work. The defendant's attorney objected on the grounds that the company routinely recorded such factual information in their log books, which were in the company's possession. As a consequence, the supervisor's testimony should be ruled

Options:

A: inadmissible, because such testimony would be violative of the best evidence rule.
B: inadmissible, because no evidence was introduced to show that the original log records are not available for examination.
C: admissible, because it is relevant to the case.
D: admissible, because the supervisor is a credible witness.
E: admissible, because it is based on firsthand knowledge.
F: inadmissible, because it would be hearsay evidence.
G: inadmissible, because the information is not relevant to the case.
H: admissible, because the supervisor was directly involved in the construction work.
I: admissible, because it is a report of regularly conducted business activities.
J: inadmissible, because the supervisor was not under oath when the information was recorded.

Okay, so I've got this question about evidence law, specifically about the admissibility of a supervisor's testimony. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the scenario: A construction company sues a city for not paying under their contract. At trial, the company's supervisor is called to testify about the amount of sewer pipe used, the hours required, and the number of workers. The city objects, saying the company has log books with this info.

The question is whether the supervisor's testimony should be admitted or excluded.

I remember that in evidence law, there are rules about what can be admitted, like the best evidence rule and hearsay. Let's think about each.

The best evidence rule (also called the original writing rule) says that when a party is trying to prove the content of a writing, they must produce the original unless an exception applies. So if the supervisor is testifying about numbers that are in the log books, the city might argue that the supervisor's memory isn't as reliable as the written records, and thus the testimony should be excluded under the best evidence rule.

But wait, the best evidence rule applies when the content of a writing is at issue. Here, the supervisor is testifying based on personal knowledge, not just recounting the log book. So maybe the best evidence rule doesn't apply here because he's not trying to prove the contents of the log book, but rather his own observations.

Alternatively, the issue might be hearsay. Hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered for the truth of the matter asserted. The supervisor's testimony is based on his own knowledge, so it's not hearsay. Unless the testimony is about what others told him, which it doesn't seem likeâ€”it's about his own observations.

Another angle: the business records exception. If the log books are made as part of the company's regular business activity, they might be admissible. But the supervisor isn't offering the log books himself; he's testifying from memory. So the business records exception might not apply here because the testimony isn't about the records but about his firsthand knowledge.

Wait, but the objection was about the log books being available. The city's attorney is objecting because the company has the logs. So maybe the objection is based on the best evidence rule, thinking that without the log, the supervisor's testimony isn't enough.

But I think the best evidence rule isn't the issue here because the supervisor isn't trying to prove the content of the log; he's testifying about his personal knowledge. So the testimony should be admissible because it's based on firsthand knowledge, not on the records.

Looking at the options:

A: Inadmissible due to best evidence. I don't think so because it's not about the content of the writing.

B: Inadmissible because original records not shown. But the testimony isn't about the records; it's about the supervisor's knowledge.

C: Admissible because relevant. Well, it's probably relevant to determine the amount owed, so yes.

D: Admissible because credible. Credibility is a factor, but the main issue is whether the testimony is allowed.

E: Admissible because firsthand knowledge. Yes, he was there, so his testimony is based on personal knowledge.

F: Inadmissible as hearsay. No, because it's his own knowledge, not someone else's statement.

G: Inadmissible because not relevant. No, it's relevant to the work done and payment.

H: Admissible because directly involved. That's a factor, but not the main rule.

I: Admissible as business records. But he's not introducing the records; he's testifying based on his own knowledge.

J: Inadmissible because not under oath. He's testifying in court under oath, so that's fine.

So the strongest options are E and C. But E is more specific about firsthand knowledge, which is a better reason for admissibility. So I think E is the correct answer.

The supervisor's testimony is based on his firsthand knowledge of the repair work, making it admissible under the rules of evidence. The best evidence rule does not apply here because the testimony is not about the content of the log books but the supervisor's personal observations. Hearsay is not an issue because the testimony is not an out-of-court statement offered for its truth. Therefore, the testimony is admissible because it is based on firsthand knowledge.
