Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this question about the mammalian cardiac cycle and how blood pressure changes when blood is transferred from the venous side to the arterial side. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that the cardiac cycle involves the filling and emptying of the heart chambers. The stroke volume is the amount of blood the ventricles pump out with each contraction. So during each cycle, a volume equal to the stroke volume moves from the venous system into the arterial system.

Now, the question is about the pressures in the venous and arterial compartments. Venous and arterial systems have different levels of compliance. Compliance refers to how much a system can expand when pressure is applied. High compliance means the system can stretch more without a significant increase in pressure, while low compliance means pressure increases more with the same volume change.

Venous side is more compliant. That means when blood is added to the venous system, it can expand more without a big rise in pressure. On the other hand, the arterial side is less compliant. So when blood is pumped into the arteries, they don't expand as much, leading to a larger increase in pressure.

So during the cardiac cycle, when the ventricles eject blood into the arteries (which is during systole), the arteries must accommodate this volume. Since they're less compliant, the pressure in the arteries (arterial pressure) increases significantly. At the same time, when the ventricles relax and fill with blood during diastole, the venous system, being more compliant, doesn't see as much of a pressure change because it can expand more to hold the returning blood.

Wait, but the question says that a volume equal to stroke volume is transferred from the venous to the arterial side. So during each cycle, the same volume is moved. So when blood is pushed into the arteries, their pressure goes up. Because the arteries can't expand much, this leads to a large increase in arterial pressure. 

What about the venous pressure? The venous system is more compliant, so when blood flows into it (during diastole), the pressure doesn't rise as much. But wait, during systole, the ventricles are ejecting blood into the arteries, which is when the pressure in the arteries increases. But what about the venous system during this time? When the ventricles contract, they empty into the arteries, so the venous system is filling during diastole, not during systole. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, let me clarify. The stroke volume is the amount ejected into the arteries each time. So during systole, the ventricles push that volume into the arteries, causing the arteries to experience a pressure rise. Since the arteries can't stretch much, the pressure increases a lot. On the venous side, during diastole, the ventricles fill with blood from the veins, so the venous system is supplying that blood. But since the venous system is more compliant, the pressure in the veins doesn't change much when this blood is taken in.

So when the stroke volume is transferred from venous to arterial, the venous system's pressure doesn't increase much because of its high compliance. Meanwhile, the arteries, being less compliant, experience a significant pressure increase when the same volume is added during each contraction.

Looking at the options, I think the correct answer is B: little effect on venous pressure and a large increase in arterial pressure. Because the venous system can handle the volume without much pressure change, while the arteries have a big increase.

Wait, but let me double-check. Another way to think: when the heart pumps blood into the arteries, the arteries have to accommodate that volume. Since they're less compliant, their pressure rises a lot. The venous system, which is more compliant, doesn't see a big change because it can expand. So the venous pressure would be relatively unchanged, and the arterial pressure would go up a lot. That matches option B.

The mammalian cardiac cycle involves transferring a volume of blood equivalent to the ventricular stroke volume from the venous side to the arterial side. The venous system is more compliant, meaning it can expand more without a significant increase in pressure, while the arterial system is less compliant, leading to a larger pressure rise when blood is added.

During systole, the ventricles eject blood into the arteries, causing a large increase in arterial pressure due to the low compliance of the arterial system. Simultaneously, the venous system, being more compliant, experiences little change in pressure as it accommodates the returning blood during diastole. Therefore, the transfer results in little effect on venous pressure and a large increase in arterial pressure.

Answer: B
