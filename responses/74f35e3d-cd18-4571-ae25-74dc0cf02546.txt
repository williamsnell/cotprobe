Question:

While visiting at his son's home, a grandfather tripped on a toy left on the floor by his four-year- old grandson. The grandfather fell and was severely injured. The grandfather regularly visited his son's home and was aware that the grandson routinely left toys scattered about the house. The son had never warned the grandfather to look out for toys. The grandfather brought an action against his son to recover for his injuries. At trial, after the close of evidence, both the grandfather and the son have moved for judgment as a matter of law as to liability. The jurisdiction has abolished intra-family immunity and applies the traditional rules of landowner liability. What action should the court take?

Options:

A: Grant the grandfather's motion, because the son is liable as a matter of law for failing to warn about the risk of toys being left on the floor.
B: Deny both motions and submit the case to the jury based on premises liability.
C: Grant the son's motion, because the grandfather was aware of the risk and still chose to visit.
D: Deny both motions and submit the case to the jury based on strict liability.
E: Grant the son's motion, because the grandfather failed to exercise due care in avoiding the toy.
F: Deny the grandfather's motion, because the son had no duty to control the behavior of his child.
G: Grant both motions, as both parties share equal liability for the incident.
H: Grant the grandfather's motion, because the son had a duty to maintain a safe environment for visitors.
I: Deny both motions and submit the case to the jury based on negligence.
J: Grant the son's motion, because the son had no duty to warn that the grandson might leave toys on the floor.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this tort law question. Let me read through it carefully. 

The situation is about a grandfather who tripped on a toy left by his four-year-old grandson at his son's home. The grandfather was visiting regularly and knew the grandson often left toys around. The son never warned him about looking out for toys. Now, the grandfather is suing his son for his injuries, and both have moved for judgment as a matter of law on liability. The jurisdiction has abolished intra-family immunity and uses the traditional landowner liability rules.

So, the question is what the court should do regarding their motions. The options are A through J, each suggesting different outcomes.

First, I need to recall the rules of premises liability. Landowners generally have a duty to maintain their property in a safe condition for invitees. But there are exceptions, like for children, the attractive nuisance doctrine might apply, but I think that's more about things that are dangerous and on the property that a child might be attracted to, like a swimming pool.

Wait, in this case, the issue is toys on the floor. So, the son's home is where the grandfather is visiting, making him an invitee. The grandson's behavior is leaving toys scattered. The grandfather knew this was a risk because he regularly visited and saw the toys.

Under premises liability, the landowner (son) has a duty to inspect and warn of hidden dangers. But in this case, the toys are in plain view, right? If the toys are left on the floor, and it's a common area where the grandfather walks, is the son's duty to warn about that?

Wait, but the toys are placed by the grandson. The son is the parent, so does he have a duty to control his child's actions? Or is the duty to warn about known dangers that aren't obvious? 

I remember that in some cases, if a condition is open and obvious, the landowner isn't required to warn. Also, if the invitee is aware of the risk, the landowner's duty might be limited. 

But the grandfather was aware that the grandson left toys around. So, he knew about the risk but still chose to visit, meaning he assumed the risk. So, could the son's duty be non-existent because the risk was open and obvious?

Wait, but the grandfather is suing the son for failing to warn. The son didn't warn him. But if the risk was obvious, the son might not have a duty to warn. So, in that case, the grandfather would be contributorily negligent or assume the risk, which could bar recovery.

But wait, the jurisdiction has abolished intra-family immunity. So, the son isn't immune from suit just because they're family. But that doesn't directly answer the duty question.

So, the key points are: grandfather is an invitee, the risk (toys on the floor) is open and obvious, and the son didn't warn. The grandfather knew about it but still came and tripped.

In premises liability, if the condition is open and obvious, the landowner isn't liable because the invitee should have noticed and avoided it. So, the son may not have a duty to warn about something so obvious. Therefore, the grandfather can't hold the son liable for failing to warn.

Looking at the options, let's see.

Option A: Grandfather's motion granted because son failed to warn. But if the risk was obvious, the son isn't liable because he had no duty to warn. So A might not be correct.

Option B: Deny both motions and send to jury based on premises liability. But if the issue is whether the risk was obvious, the court might decide as a matter of law, not let the jury decide. So B may not be right.

Option C: Son's motion granted because grandfather knew the risk. That sounds plausible. Because if the risk was known, the son's duty is discharged.

Option E: Son's motion granted because grandfather didn't exercise due care. So, the grandfather's own negligence contributed. But the issue is whether the son had a duty. If the son had no duty to warn, then the grandfather can't recover, regardless of his own actions.

Option F: Deny grandfather's motion because son had no duty to control the child. Wait, the son's duty isn't about controlling the child, but about the premises. So, the duty to warn about dangers. If the danger is open and obvious, then no duty. So F says the son had no duty to control the child, which is correct, but the issue here is about the warning, not the child's behavior.

Option H: Grant grandfather's motion because son had a duty to maintain a safe environment. But if the risk was obvious, the son's duty is to warn, which he didn't, but if the risk was obvious, he's not required to warn.

Wait, but in premises liability, the duty is to warn of hidden dangers. If the danger is open and obvious, the landowner isn't liable. So, in this case, the toys are on the floor, which the grandfather was aware of. So the danger was open and obvious, so the son had no duty to warn.

If that's the case, then the son's motion should be granted because the son had no duty to warn. So looking at the options, which one aligns with that.

Option J: Grant son's motion because he had no duty to warn about the toys. Yes, that makes sense.

Option E says the grandfather failed to exercise due care. But the question is about the son's duty, not the grandfather's negligence. If the son had no duty, the grandfather can't recover, regardless of the grandfather's own actions.

So, the correct answer would be J: Grant the son's motion because he had no duty to warn that the grandson might leave toys on the floor.

Wait, but in some cases, even if the condition is obvious, if the landowner creates the risk or knows about it, they might have a duty. But here, the son didn't create the risk; the grandson did. And the son didn't warn because it was obvious.

I think the key is whether the risk was open and obvious. Since the grandfather was aware, the risk was obvious. So the son had no duty to warn, making J the correct answer.
</think>

The jurisdiction has abolished intra-family immunity, meaning the son is not immune from liability solely because of their family relationship. However, under premises liability, a landowner generally has a duty to warn invitees of hidden dangers. In this case, the toys left on the floor by the grandson were in plain view, making the risk open and obvious. Since the grandfather was aware of this risk and still chose to visit, the son had no duty to warn about it. Therefore, the son's motion should be granted because he had no duty to warn about the toys.
