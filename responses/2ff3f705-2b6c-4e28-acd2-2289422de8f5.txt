Okay, so I've got this initial value problem to solve. The equation is ty' - 2y = t^5 sin(2t) - t^3 + 4t^4, and the initial condition is y(π) = (3π^4)/2. I need to find y(t) when t = π/2. Hmm, that seems a bit involved, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

First, I should probably rewrite the differential equation in a more standard form. The equation is linear in y, so it should be possible to solve using an integrating factor. Let me see... The standard form for a linear DE is y' + P(t)y = Q(t). So I'll divide everything by t to get y' on its own.

Dividing both sides by t gives y' - (2/t)y = t^4 sin(2t) - t^2 + 4t^3. Wait, let me check that. The right-hand side was t^5 sin(2t) - t^3 + 4t^4. Dividing each term by t, that becomes t^4 sin(2t) - t^2 + 4t^3. So P(t) here is -2/t, and Q(t) is t^4 sin(2t) - t^2 + 4t^3.

Now, the integrating factor μ(t) is usually e^(∫P(t) dt). So integrating -2/t with respect to t gives -2 ln|t|, which is ln(t^-2). So the integrating factor is e^(ln(t^-2)) = t^-2, which is 1/t².

Next, I'll multiply both sides of the DE by the integrating factor. So:

(1/t²) y' - (2/t³) y = (1/t²)(t^4 sin(2t) - t^2 + 4t^3).

Simplifying each term on the right:

(1/t²) * t^4 = t², so t² sin(2t).

(1/t²) * (-t^2) = -1.

(1/t²) * 4t^3 = 4t.

So the right-hand side simplifies to t² sin(2t) - 1 + 4t.

Now, the left-hand side should now be the derivative of (μ(t) y), which is (1/t²) y. So, d/dt [y / t²] = t² sin(2t) - 1 + 4t.

To find y, I'll integrate both sides with respect to t. So:

∫ d/dt [y / t²] dt = ∫ [t² sin(2t) - 1 + 4t] dt.

The left side integrates to y / t². The right side needs to be integrated term by term.

Let's tackle each integral:

1. ∫ t² sin(2t) dt.
2. ∫ (-1) dt = -t + C.
3. ∫ 4t dt = 2t² + C.

For the first integral, ∫ t² sin(2t) dt, I'll use integration by parts. Let me set u = t², dv = sin(2t) dt. Then du = 2t dt, and v = - (1/2) cos(2t).

So, using integration by parts formula ∫ u dv = uv - ∫ v du:

= - (t²)(1/2) cos(2t) + ∫ (1/2) cos(2t) * 2t dt.

Simplify:

= - (t² / 2) cos(2t) + ∫ t cos(2t) dt.

Now, the remaining integral ∫ t cos(2t) dt can be done by parts again. Let me set u = t, dv = cos(2t) dt. Then du = dt, v = (1/2) sin(2t).

So, ∫ t cos(2t) dt = (t)(1/2 sin 2t) - ∫ (1/2 sin 2t) dt.

= (t/2) sin(2t) - (1/2) ∫ sin(2t) dt.

= (t/2) sin(2t) + (1/4) cos(2t) + C.

Putting it all back together:

∫ t² sin(2t) dt = - (t² / 2) cos(2t) + (t/2) sin(2t) + (1/4) cos(2t) + C.

So combining all the integrals:

The integral of the right-hand side becomes:

[- (t² / 2) cos(2t) + (t/2) sin(2t) + (1/4) cos(2t)] - t + 2t² + C.

So now, y / t² equals this expression. Therefore, y = t² [ - (t² / 2) cos(2t) + (t/2) sin(2t) + (1/4) cos(2t) - t + 2t² ] + C t².

Wait, let me double-check that. Because when I integrate, I have:

y / t² = [ - (t² / 2) cos(2t) + (t/2) sin(2t) + (1/4) cos(2t) ] - t + 2t² + C.

So multiplying both sides by t²:

y = t² [ expression ] + C t².

Wait, no, that's not correct. Because when I integrate, the right-hand side is the integral, which is equal to y/t². So y = t² [ integral result ] + C t²? Wait, no. Wait, no, the integration gives y/t² = [integral] + C, so y = t² ([integral] + C).

Wait, perhaps it's better to write it as y/t² = integral + C, so y = t² (integral) + C t². Hmm, maybe I should have included the constant during integration. Let me correct that.

So y/t² = ∫ [t² sin(2t) -1 +4t ] dt = [ - (t² / 2) cos(2t) + (t/2) sin(2t) + (1/4) cos(2t) ] - t + 2t² + C.

So y = t² [ - (t² / 2) cos(2t) + (t/2) sin(2t) + (1/4) cos(2t) - t + 2t² ] + C t².

Wait, that seems a bit complicated. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the integration.

Wait, perhaps I should have kept track better. Let me write the integral again:

∫ [t² sin(2t) -1 +4t ] dt = ∫ t² sin(2t) dt - ∫ 1 dt + ∫4t dt.

Which is:

= [ - (t² / 2) cos(2t) + (t/2) sin(2t) + (1/4) cos(2t) ] - t + 2t² + C.

So y/t² = [ - (t² / 2) cos(2t) + (t/2) sin(2t) + (1/4) cos(2t) - t + 2t² ] + C.

Therefore, y = t² [ - (t² / 2) cos(2t) + (t/2) sin(2t) + (1/4) cos(2t) - t + 2t² ] + C t².

Hmm, that's quite a long expression. Let me see if I can simplify it.

Let's combine terms:

First, expand the terms inside the brackets multiplied by t²:

y = t²*(-t²/2 cos(2t)) + t²*(t/2 sin(2t)) + t²*(1/4 cos(2t)) + t²*(-t) + t²*(2t²) + C t².

Simplify each term:

- t^4 / 2 cos(2t) + (t^3)/2 sin(2t) + (t^2)/4 cos(2t) - t^3 + 2t^4 + C t^2.

Now, let's combine like terms:

The t^4 terms: (-1/2 cos(2t) + 2) t^4.

The t^3 terms: (1/2 sin(2t) - 1) t^3.

The t^2 terms: (1/4 cos(2t)) t^2.

Plus C t^2.

Wait, that seems a bit complicated. Maybe I can factor some terms:

y = [2t^4 - (1/2) cos(2t) t^4] + [ (1/2 sin(2t) -1) t^3 ] + [ (1/4 cos(2t) + C) t^2 ].

Hmm, perhaps I should write it as:

y = t^4 (2 - (1/2) cos(2t)) + t^3 ( (1/2 sin(2t) - 1) ) + t^2 (1/4 cos(2t) + C).

Now, we have the general solution. But we need to apply the initial condition y(π) = (3π^4)/2.

So let's plug t = π into the expression for y:

y(π) = π^4 (2 - (1/2) cos(2π)) + π^3 ( (1/2 sin(2π) - 1) ) + π^2 (1/4 cos(2π) + C).

Let's compute each part:

cos(2π) = 1, sin(2π) = 0.

So substituting:

y(π) = π^4 (2 - (1/2)(1)) + π^3 ( (1/2 * 0) - 1 ) + π^2 ( (1/4)(1) + C ).

Simplify each term:

First term: π^4 (2 - 0.5) = π^4 (1.5) = 3π^4 / 2.

Second term: π^3 (0 - 1) = -π^3.

Third term: π^2 (0.25 + C).

So putting it all together:

y(π) = (3π^4 / 2) - π^3 + π^2 (0.25 + C).

But we know y(π) = 3π^4 / 2, so:

3π^4 / 2 = (3π^4 / 2) - π^3 + π^2 (0.25 + C).

Subtracting 3π^4 / 2 from both sides:

0 = -π^3 + π^2 (0.25 + C).

Let's solve for C:

π^2 (0.25 + C) = π^3.

Divide both sides by π^2:

0.25 + C = π.

So C = π - 0.25.

So now, the particular solution is:

y = t^4 (2 - (1/2) cos(2t)) + t^3 ( (1/2 sin(2t) - 1) ) + t^2 (1/4 cos(2t) + π - 0.25).

Wait, but that's a bit messy. Maybe I can factor some terms or make it more concise.

Alternatively, perhaps I should write the solution as y = t² [ ... ] + C t², where C is π - 0.25.

Wait, perhaps it's better to go back to the expression before expanding:

y = t² [ - (t² / 2) cos(2t) + (t/2) sin(2t) + (1/4) cos(2t) - t + 2t² ] + (π - 0.25) t².

Hmm, perhaps I can combine terms inside the brackets:

Let me collect like terms:

- (t² / 2) cos(2t) + (1/4) cos(2t) = cos(2t)( -t²/2 + 1/4 )

(t/2) sin(2t) remains as is.

- t + 2t².

So y = t² [ cos(2t)( -t²/2 + 1/4 ) + (t/2) sin(2t) - t + 2t² ] + (π - 0.25) t².

Wait, this might not be the most efficient way, but perhaps I can compute y(π/2) directly.

So I need to compute y(t) at t = π/2.

Let me substitute t = π/2 into the expression for y.

First, compute each part step by step.

Compute cos(2t) when t = π/2: cos(2*(π/2)) = cos(π) = -1.

sin(2t) when t = π/2: sin(π) = 0.

So let's compute each term in the expression for y at t = π/2.

Starting with y(t) = t^4 (2 - (1/2) cos(2t)) + t^3 ( (1/2 sin(2t) - 1) ) + t^2 (1/4 cos(2t) + π - 0.25).

Substituting t = π/2:

First term: (π/2)^4 (2 - (1/2)(-1)) = (π^4 / 16) [2 + 0.5] = (π^4 / 16)(2.5) = (5/16) π^4.

Second term: (π/2)^3 ( (1/2)(0) - 1 ) = (π^3 / 8)(0 - 1) = - π^3 / 8.

Third term: (π/2)^2 ( (1/4)(-1) + π - 0.25 ) = (π^2 / 4)( -1/4 + π - 0.25 ).

Simplify inside the parentheses:

-1/4 - 0.25 = -1/4 - 1/4 = -1/2.

So it's ( -1/2 + π ).

Thus, third term becomes (π^2 / 4)( π - 1/2 ) = (π^3 / 4) - (π^2) / 8.

Now, let's add all the terms together:

y(π/2) = (5/16)π^4 - (π^3)/8 + (π^3)/4 - (π^2)/8.

Simplify each term:

Combine the π^3 terms: (-1/8 + 1/4) π^3 = (1/8) π^3.

So y(π/2) = (5/16)π^4 + (1/8)π^3 - (1/8)π^2.

Hmm, let me calculate the numerical value.

Compute each term separately:

First, compute π^4:

π ≈ 3.1416.

π^2 ≈ 9.8696.

π^3 ≈ 31.0063.

π^4 ≈ 97.4091.

So:

5/16 π^4 ≈ (5 * 97.4091) / 16 ≈ (487.0455)/16 ≈ 30.4397.

1/8 π^3 ≈ 31.0063 / 8 ≈ 3.8758.

-1/8 π^2 ≈ -9.8696 / 8 ≈ -1.2337.

Now add them up:

30.4397 + 3.8758 = 34.3155.

34.3155 - 1.2337 ≈ 33.0818.

Wait, but looking at the options, the highest is 24.512. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, let me check my calculations again.

Wait, when I substituted t = π/2, let me make sure I did each term correctly.

First term: t^4 (2 - (1/2) cos(2t)).

t = π/2: t^4 = (π/2)^4 = π^4 / 16.

cos(2t) = cos(π) = -1.

So 2 - (1/2)(-1) = 2 + 0.5 = 2.5 = 5/2.

So first term: (π^4 / 16) * (5/2) = (5 π^4) / 32 ≈ (5 * 97.4091) / 32 ≈ 487.0455 /32 ≈ 15.218.

Wait, I think I messed up the denominator earlier. Wait, 5/16 π^4 would be (5 * 97.4091)/16, but in reality, it's (5/32) π^4, because (π^4 /16) * (5/2) = 5 π^4 /32.

So wait, I think I made a mistake in the first term's coefficient.

Let me recompute each term correctly.

First term:

(π/2)^4 = (π^4) / (2^4) = π^4 / 16.

Multiply by (2 - (1/2)(-1)) = 2 + 0.5 = 2.5 = 5/2.

So first term: (π^4 /16) * (5/2) = (5 π^4) / 32 ≈ (5 * 97.4091)/32 ≈ 487.0455 /32 ≈ 15.218.

Second term:

(π/2)^3 * ( (1/2)(0) -1 ) = (π^3 /8) * (-1) = - π^3 /8 ≈ -31.0063 /8 ≈ -3.8758.

Third term:

(π/2)^2 * [ (1/4)(-1) + π - 0.25 ].

(π^2 /4) * [ (-1/4) + π - 1/4 ].

Simplify inside: (-1/4 -1/4) = -1/2, so:

(π^2 /4) * (π - 1/2).

So compute (π^2 /4) * π = π^3 /4 ≈ 31.0063 /4 ≈ 7.7516.

And (π^2 /4) * (-1/2) = - π^2 /8 ≈ -9.8696 /8 ≈ -1.2337.

So third term: 7.7516 - 1.2337 ≈ 6.5179.

Now, adding all three terms:

15.218 (first term) -3.8758 (second term) +6.5179 (third term).

15.218 -3.8758 = 11.3422.

11.3422 +6.5179 ≈ 17.8601.

Hmm, that's approximately 17.86, which is close to option F: 17.234 or E:16.389. But wait, perhaps I made an error in calculations.

Wait, perhaps I should compute more accurately.

Let me compute each term with more precision.

Compute first term: 5 π^4 /32.

π^4 ≈ 97.40909103.

5 * 97.40909103 = 487.04545515.

Divide by 32: 487.04545515 /32 ≈ 15.21954547.

Second term: - π^3 /8.

π^3 ≈ 31.00627668.

31.00627668 /8 ≈ 3.875784585.

So -3.875784585.

Third term: (π^2 /4)(π - 1/2).

π^2 ≈ 9.8696044.

π ≈3.14159265.

So π - 0.5 ≈2.64159265.

So π^2 /4 ≈9.8696044 /4 ≈2.4674011.

Multiply by (2.64159265):

2.4674011 *2.64159265 ≈ Let's compute:

2.4674 *2.6416 ≈ 

Compute 2 *2.6416 =5.2832.

0.4674 *2.6416 ≈ approx 1.234.

So total ≈5.2832 +1.234 ≈6.5172.

So third term ≈6.5172.

Now, adding them up:

15.21954547 -3.875784585 =11.343760885.

11.343760885 +6.5172 ≈17.860960885.

Hmm, that's approximately 17.861.

Looking at the options, the closest is option I:19.095. Wait, but that's not close. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in setting up the solution.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the integrating factor or the integration steps.

Let me go back and check.

Starting again, the DE is ty' -2y = t^5 sin(2t) -t^3 +4t^4.

Dividing by t: y' - (2/t)y = t^4 sin(2t) -t^2 +4t^3.

So P(t) = -2/t, Q(t) = t^4 sin(2t) -t^2 +4t^3.

Integrating factor μ(t) = e^{∫-2/t dt} = e^{-2 ln t} = t^{-2}.

Multiply both sides by μ(t): t^{-2} y' -2 t^{-3} y = t^{-2} [t^4 sin(2t) -t^2 +4t^3].

Simplify RHS:

t^{-2} * t^4 sin(2t) = t^2 sin(2t).

t^{-2}*(-t^2) = -1.

t^{-2}*4t^3 =4t.

So RHS is t^2 sin(2t)-1+4t.

Left side is d/dt [ y * t^{-2} ].

Integrate both sides:

y t^{-2} = ∫ [t^2 sin(2t) -1 +4t ] dt + C.

Which is:

y t^{-2} = ∫ t^2 sin(2t) dt - ∫1 dt + ∫4t dt.

We did the integral ∫ t^2 sin(2t) dt earlier, which was:

- (t^2 /2) cos(2t) + (t/2) sin(2t) + (1/4) cos(2t).

So putting it all together:

y t^{-2} = [ - (t^2 /2) cos(2t) + (t/2) sin(2t) + (1/4) cos(2t) ] - t + 2t^2 + C.

Multiply both sides by t^2:

y = t^2 [ - (t^2 /2) cos(2t) + (t/2) sin(2t) + (1/4) cos(2t) ] - t^3 + 2t^4 + C t^2.

Wait, but when I applied the initial condition earlier, I think I may have made a mistake in expanding the terms.

Let me correctly compute y(π):

y(π) = π^2 [ - (π^2 /2) cos(2π) + (π/2) sin(2π) + (1/4) cos(2π) ] - π^3 + 2π^4 + C π^2.

Compute each term:

cos(2π)=1, sin(2π)=0.

So:

y(π)= π^2 [ - (π^2 /2)(1) + 0 + (1/4)(1) ] - π^3 + 2π^4 + C π^2.

Simplify inside the brackets:

- (π^2 /2) + 1/4.

So,

y(π)= π^2 ( -π^2 /2 + 1/4 ) - π^3 + 2π^4 + C π^2.

Expanding:

= - (π^4)/2 + (π^2)/4 - π^3 + 2π^4 + C π^2.

Combine like terms:

- (π^4)/2 + 2π^4 = (3/2) π^4.

(π^2)/4 + C π^2 = (1/4 + C) π^2.

So,

y(π) = (3/2) π^4 + (1/4 + C) π^2 - π^3.

But we know y(π) = (3 π^4)/2.

So,

(3/2) π^4 + (1/4 + C) π^2 - π^3 = (3/2) π^4.

Subtract (3/2) π^4 from both sides:

(1/4 + C) π^2 - π^3 = 0.

So,

(1/4 + C) π^2 = π^3.

Divide both sides by π^2:

1/4 + C = π.

Thus, C = π - 1/4.

So now, the particular solution is:

y = t^2 [ - (t^2 /2) cos(2t) + (t/2) sin(2t) + (1/4) cos(2t) ] - t^3 + 2t^4 + (π - 1/4) t^2.

Let me simplify this expression.

First, expand the terms inside the brackets multiplied by t^2:

y = t^2*(-t^2/2 cos(2t)) + t^2*(t/2 sin(2t)) + t^2*(1/4 cos(2t)) - t^3 + 2t^4 + (π - 1/4) t^2.

Simplify each term:

= - t^4 / 2 cos(2t) + t^3 / 2 sin(2t) + t^2 / 4 cos(2t) - t^3 + 2t^4 + (π - 1/4) t^2.

Now, let's combine like terms:

- t^4 / 2 cos(2t) + 2t^4.

+ t^3 / 2 sin(2t) - t^3.

+ t^2 /4 cos(2t) + (π - 1/4) t^2.

So,

y = [2t^4 - (t^4 / 2) cos(2t)] + [ (t^3 / 2 sin(2t) ) - t^3 ] + [ (t^2 /4 cos(2t) ) + (π - 1/4) t^2 ].

Now, factor where possible:

= t^4 (2 - (1/2) cos(2t)) + t^3 ( (1/2 sin(2t) -1) ) + t^2 ( (1/4 cos(2t) ) + π - 1/4 ).

Now, let's compute y(π/2):

First, compute each part at t = π/2.

cos(2t) = cos(π) = -1.

sin(2t) = sin(π) = 0.

So,

t = π/2:

Compute each term:

1. t^4 (2 - (1/2) cos(2t)) = (π/2)^4 (2 - (1/2)(-1)) = (π^4 / 16)(2 + 0.5) = (π^4 / 16)(2.5) = (5 π^4)/32.

2. t^3 ( (1/2 sin(2t) -1) ) = (π/2)^3 (0 - 1) = (π^3 / 8)(-1) = - π^3 /8.

3. t^2 ( (1/4 cos(2t) ) + π - 1/4 ) = (π/2)^2 ( (1/4)(-1) + π - 1/4 ) = (π^2 /4)( -1/4 + π - 1/4 ) = (π^2 /4)( π - 1/2 ).

Let me compute each term numerically.

First term: (5 π^4)/32.

π^4 ≈97.4091.

5 * 97.4091 ≈487.0455.

487.0455 /32 ≈15.2195.

Second term: -π^3 /8 ≈-31.0063 /8 ≈-3.8758.

Third term: (π^2 /4)(π - 1/2).

π^2 ≈9.8696.

π ≈3.1416.

So π - 1/2 ≈2.6416.

So (9.8696 /4) * 2.6416 ≈2.4674 *2.6416 ≈ Let me calculate 2.4674 *2.6416.

2 *2.6416 =5.2832.

0.4674 *2.6416 ≈1.234.

So total ≈5.2832 +1.234 ≈6.5172.

Now, sum all three terms:

15.2195 -3.8758 +6.5172 ≈15.2195 -3.8758 =11.3437 +6.5172=17.8609.

So y(π/2)≈17.8609.

Looking at the options, the closest is option F:17.234 or option I:19.095. But 17.86 is not exactly matching any option. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in computation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute more accurately.

Compute each term with more precision.

First term: (5 π^4)/32.

π ≈3.1415926535.

π^4 = (3.1415926535)^4 ≈97.409091034.

5 *97.409091034 =487.04545517.

Divide by32:487.04545517 /32 ≈15.21954547.

Second term: -π^3 /8.

π^3 ≈31.00627668.

31.00627668 /8 ≈3.875784585.

So -3.875784585.

Third term: (π^2 /4)(π - 0.5).

π^2 ≈9.8696044.

π -0.5 ≈2.6415926535.

Multiply π^2 /4 ≈2.4674011.

2.4674011 *2.6415926535 ≈ Let's compute:

2 *2.6415926535 =5.283185307.

0.4674011 *2.6415926535 ≈ approx 1.234.

So total ≈5.283185307 +1.234≈6.517185307.

Now, sum all three terms:

15.21954547 -3.875784585 =11.343760885.

11.343760885 +6.517185307 ≈17.86094619.

Rounded to three decimal places, that's 17.8609.

Looking at the options, the closest is option F:17.234, but that's not very close. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the integrating factor step.

Wait, let's double-check the integrating factor.

The DE is y' - (2/t)y = t^4 sin(2t) - t^2 +4t^3.

Integrating factor is e^{∫-2/t dt} = e^{-2 ln t} = t^{-2}.

Multiplying through by t^{-2}:

t^{-2} y' - 2 t^{-3} y = t^{-2} (t^4 sin(2t) - t^2 +4t^3 ) = t^2 sin(2t) -1 +4t.

Left side is d/dt [ t^{-2} y ].

So integrating both sides:

t^{-2} y = ∫ [t^2 sin(2t) -1 +4t ] dt + C.

Which gives:

y = t^2 [ ∫ t^2 sin(2t) dt - ∫1 dt + ∫4t dt ] + C t^2.

Which is what I did earlier. So perhaps my mistake is elsewhere.

Wait, when I applied the initial condition, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, when t=π:

y(π) = π^2 [ - (π^2 /2) cos(2π) + (π/2) sin(2π) + (1/4) cos(2π) ] - π^3 +2π^4 + C π^2.

Which is:

= π^2 [ -π²/2 *1 + 0 + 1/4 *1 ] - π^3 + 2π^4 + C π^2.

= π^2 (-π²/2 + 1/4 ) - π^3 + 2π^4 + C π^2.

= -π^4 /2 + π^2 /4 - π^3 + 2π^4 + C π^2.

= ( -0.5 +2 ) π^4 + (0.25 + C) π^2 - π^3.

= 1.5 π^4 + (0.25 + C) π^2 - π^3.

Set equal to 3π^4 /2.

So,

1.5 π^4 + (0.25 + C) π^2 - π^3 = 1.5 π^4.

Subtract 1.5 π^4:

(0.25 + C) π^2 - π^3 =0.

So,

(0.25 + C) π^2 = π^3.

Divide both sides by π^2:

0.25 + C = π.

So,

C = π - 0.25.

That seems correct.

So the solution is correct, and y(π/2) ≈17.8609, which isn't exactly one of the options. The closest option is F:17.234, but that's a bit off. Alternatively, perhaps I miscalculated.

Wait, perhaps I should check the integral ∫ t^2 sin(2t) dt again.

Let me recompute ∫ t^2 sin(2t) dt.

Using integration by parts:

Let u = t², dv = sin(2t) dt.

Then du = 2t dt, v = - (1/2) cos(2t).

So,

∫ t^2 sin(2t) dt = - t² (1/2) cos(2t) + ∫ (1/2) cos(2t) * 2t dt.

= - (t²/2) cos(2t) + ∫ t cos(2t) dt.

Now, ∫ t cos(2t) dt:

Let u = t, dv = cos(2t) dt.

du = dt, v = (1/2) sin(2t).

So,

= t*(1/2) sin(2t) - ∫ (1/2) sin(2t) dt.

= (t/2) sin(2t) + (1/4) cos(2t).

So,

∫ t^2 sin(2t) dt = - (t²/2) cos(2t) + (t/2) sin(2t) + (1/4) cos(2t) + C.

Yes, that's correct. So no mistake there.

Wait, perhaps I should recalculate y(π/2) using more precise values.

Compute each term precisely:

First term: (5 π^4)/32 ≈ (5 *97.40909103)/32 ≈487.04545515/32≈15.21954547.

Second term: -π^3 /8 ≈-31.00627668/8≈-3.875784585.

Third term: (π^2 /4)(π -1/2).

Compute π^2 ≈9.8696044.

π ≈3.14159265.

π - 0.5≈2.64159265.

So, π^2 /4≈9.8696044/4≈2.4674011.

Multiply by 2.64159265:2.4674011 *2.64159265.

Compute:

2 *2.64159265=5.2831853.

0.4674011 *2.64159265≈0.4674 *2.6416≈1.234.

So total≈5.2831853 +1.234≈6.5171853.

Now, sum all terms:

15.21954547 -3.875784585=11.343760885.

11.343760885 +6.5171853≈17.860946185.

Hmm, that's approximately 17.8609, which isn't exactly matching any of the options. The closest option is F:17.234, but that's a difference of about 0.626. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup.

Wait, perhaps I should check the original equation and integrating factor again.

Wait, the original equation is ty' -2y = t^5 sin(2t) -t^3 +4t^4.

Dividing by t: y' - (2/t)y = t^4 sin(2t) -t^2 +4t^3.

Integrating factor: e^{∫-2/t dt} = t^{-2}.

Multiply through: t^{-2} y' - 2 t^{-3} y = t^{-2} (t^4 sin(2t) -t^2 +4t^3 )= t^2 sin(2t) -1 +4t.

Left side is d/dt [ t^{-2} y ].

Integrate both sides:

t^{-2} y = ∫ [t^2 sin(2t) -1 +4t ] dt + C.

Which gives:

y = t^2 [ ∫ t^2 sin(2t) dt - ∫1 dt + ∫4t dt ] + C t^2.

Which is what I did earlier.

Wait, perhaps I should check the integration of ∫ t^2 sin(2t) dt again.

Yes, that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps the issue is that the options are rounded, and 17.86 is not listed. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial condition.

Wait, when I substituted y(π), I might have made a mistake. Let me recalculate y(π):

y(π) = (3/2) π^4 + (1/4 + C) π^2 - π^3.

Set equal to 3π^4 /2.

So,

(3/2) π^4 + (1/4 + C) π^2 - π^3 = (3/2) π^4.

Subtract (3/2) π^4:

(1/4 + C) π^2 - π^3 =0.

So,

(1/4 + C) π^2 = π^3.

Thus,

1/4 + C = π.

So,

C = π - 1/4.

That's correct.

Hmm, perhaps the problem lies in the computation of y(π/2). Alternatively, perhaps the options are approximate, and 17.86 rounds to 18.042, which is option C.

Wait, 17.86 is closer to 17.86, which is between F (17.234) and I (19.095). Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the third term more accurately.

Third term: (π^2 /4)(π - 0.5).

Compute π^2/4:9.8696044 /4=2.4674011.

Multiply by (π -0.5)=2.6415926535.

2.4674011 *2.6415926535.

Let me compute this more accurately:

2.4674011 *2.6415926535.

Compute 2 *2.6415926535=5.283185307.

0.4674011 *2.6415926535.

Compute 0.4 *2.6415926535=1.056637061.

0.0674011 *2.6415926535≈0.17835.

So total≈1.056637061 +0.17835≈1.234987.

So total third term≈5.283185307 +1.234987≈6.518172.

Now, sum all terms:

15.21954547 -3.875784585=11.343760885 +6.518172≈17.861932885.

So about 17.8619, which is approximately 17.862, which is closest to option F:17.234 but not very close. Alternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem statement or in the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer to be approximated to three decimal places, and since 17.862 isn't an option, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, perhaps I should check if I correctly substituted t=π/2.

Wait, when t=π/2, cos(2t)=cos(π)=-1, sin(2t)=sin(π)=0.

So,

First term: t^4 (2 - (1/2) cos(2t))= (π/2)^4 (2 +0.5)= (π^4 /16)*2.5=5π^4/32≈15.2195.

Second term: t^3 ( (1/2 sin(2t) -1 ))= (π/2)^3*(-1)= -π^3/8≈-3.8758.

Third term: t^2 ( (1/4 cos(2t) ) + π - 1/4 )= (π/2)^2*( -1/4 +π -1/4 )= (π^2 /4)*(π - 0.5)=≈6.5182.

Sum:15.2195 -3.8758 +6.5182=17.8619.

Hmm, that's consistent. Since none of the options match exactly, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is option F:17.234, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should check if I correctly computed the integrating factor and the solution steps. Alternatively, perhaps I should use another method, like variation of parameters, but that might be more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use an alternative approach. Let me consider using the integrating factor again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the expression for y. Let me try an alternative approach.

The DE is linear: y' + P(t) y = Q(t).

We have P(t) = -2/t, Q(t) = t^4 sin(2t) -t^2 +4t^3.

Integrating factor μ(t)= t^{-2}.

So, solution is y = [ ∫ μ(t) Q(t) dt + C ] / μ(t).

Wait, no, the standard solution is y = (1/μ(t)) [ ∫ μ(t) Q(t) dt + C ].

Which is y = t^2 [ ∫ t^{-2} (t^4 sin(2t) -t^2 +4t^3 ) dt + C ].

Wait, no, that's not correct. The integral is ∫ μ(t) Q(t) dt, which is ∫ t^{-2} (t^4 sin(2t) -t^2 +4t^3 ) dt.

Wait, but that's the same as earlier steps.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use a different substitution.

Wait, perhaps I can write the equation as y' - (2/t)y = t^4 sin(2t) -t^2 +4t^3.

Let me use substitution v = y / t^2. Then y = v t^2, so y' = v' t^2 + 2v t.

Substituting into DE:

v' t^2 + 2v t - (2/t)(v t^2) = t^4 sin(2t) -t^2 +4t^3.

Simplify:

v' t^2 + 2v t - 2v t = t^4 sin(2t) -t^2 +4t^3.

The 2v t and -2v t cancel, so:

v' t^2 = t^4 sin(2t) -t^2 +4t^3.

Thus,

v' = t^2 sin(2t) -1/t^2 +4t.

Integrate both sides:

v = ∫ [ t^2 sin(2t) -1/t^2 +4t ] dt + C.

Which is the same integral as before. So no mistake there.

Thus, v = ∫ t^2 sin(2t) dt - ∫1/t^2 dt + ∫4t dt + C.

Which is:

v = [ - (t^2 /2) cos(2t) + (t/2) sin(2t) + (1/4) cos(2t) ] + (1/t) + 2t^2 + C.

Therefore, y = v t^2 = t^2 [ - (t^2 /2) cos(2t) + (t/2) sin(2t) + (1/4) cos(2t) + 1/t + 2t^2 ] + C t^2.

Wait, that's a different expression than before. Wait, perhaps I missed a term earlier.

Wait, when I did the integration, I think I missed the ∫4t dt part, which is 2t^2.

But in the previous steps, I think I correctly included all terms.

Wait, perhaps I should compute y(π/2) again using this new expression.

y = t^2 [ - (t^2 /2) cos(2t) + (t/2) sin(2t) + (1/4) cos(2t) + 1/t + 2t^2 ] + C t^2.

Wait, but when I computed earlier, I didn't include the 1/t term. That's probably where I made the mistake.

So, the correct expression for y is:

y = t^2 [ - (t^2 /2) cos(2t) + (t/2) sin(2t) + (1/4) cos(2t) + 1/t + 2t^2 ] + C t^2.

Now, let's compute y(π/2).

Compute each term at t=π/2:

cos(2t)=cos(π)=-1.

sin(2t)=sin(π)=0.

So,

Inside the brackets:

- (t^2 /2)(-1) + (t/2)(0) + (1/4)(-1) + 1/t + 2t^2.

= (t^2 /2) + 0 -1/4 +1/t + 2t^2.

Combine like terms:

(1/2 t^2 + 2t^2 ) = (5/2) t^2.

So,

= (5/2) t^2 -1/4 +1/t.

Now, multiply by t^2:

y = t^2 [ (5/2) t^2 -1/4 +1/t ] + C t^2.

= t^2*(5/2 t^2) + t^2*(-1/4) + t^2*(1/t) + C t^2.

= (5/2) t^4 - (1/4) t^2 + t + C t^2.

Now, apply the initial condition y(π) = 3π^4 /2.

Compute y(π):

= (5/2) π^4 - (1/4) π^2 + π + C π^2.

Set equal to 3π^4 /2:

(5/2) π^4 - (1/4) π^2 + π + C π^2 = (3/2) π^4.

Subtract (3/2) π^4 from both sides:

(5/2 -3/2) π^4 - (1/4) π^2 + π + C π^2 =0.

Simplify:

π^4 - (1/4) π^2 + π + C π^2 =0.

Rearrange:

π^4 + (C -1/4) π^2 + π =0.

Wait, that can't be right because we have a positive π^4 term. I must have made a mistake in the substitution.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in expanding y.

Wait, let me recompute y correctly.

y = t^2 [ - (t^2 /2) cos(2t) + (t/2) sin(2t) + (1/4) cos(2t) + 1/t + 2t^2 ] + C t^2.

At t=π/2:

Inside the brackets:

- ( (π/2)^2 /2 )*(-1) + (π/2 /2)*0 + (1/4)*(-1) + (1/(π/2)) + 2*(π/2)^2.

= (π^2 /8) + 0 -1/4 + 2/π + 2*(π^2 /4).

= (π^2 /8) -1/4 +2/π + (π^2 /2).

Combine π^2 terms:

π^2 /8 + π^2 /2 = (1/8 +4/8) π^2 =5π^2 /8.

So,

=5π^2 /8 -1/4 +2/π.

Multiply by t^2 = (π/2)^2 = π^2 /4.

So,

y = (π^2 /4) [5π^2 /8 -1/4 +2/π ] + C * (π^2 /4).

Compute each term:

First term: (π^2 /4)*(5π^2 /8 )=5π^4 /32 ≈15.2195.

Second term: (π^2 /4)*(-1/4)= -π^2 /16 ≈-9.8696/16≈-0.61685.

Third term: (π^2 /4)*(2/π )= (2 π^2 )/(4π )= π/2 ≈1.5708.

So,

First three terms:15.2195 -0.61685 +1.5708≈15.2195 +0.95395≈16.17345.

Plus C*(π^2 /4).

So,

y(π/2)=16.17345 + C*(π^2 /4).

Now, we need to find C using the initial condition y(π)=3π^4 /2.

Compute y(π):

y(π)= (5/2) π^4 - (1/4) π^2 + π + C π^2.

Set equal to (3/2) π^4.

So,

(5/2) π^4 - (1/4) π^2 + π + C π^2 = (3/2) π^4.

Subtract (3/2) π^4:

(5/2 -3/2) π^4 - (1/4) π^2 + π + C π^2=0.

Simplify:

π^4 - (1/4) π^2 + π + C π^2=0.

Factor π^2:

π^4 + (C -1/4) π^2 + π =0.

This can't be correct because it's a quartic equation in π, which can't be zero unless coefficients are zero, which would require C=1/4 - something, but this seems impossible. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in the substitution approach.

Wait, perhaps I should abandon this method and stick to the earlier approach where y(π/2)≈17.86, which isn't an option. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option I:19.095, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should check my calculation again for y(π/2).

Wait, earlier, when I included the 1/t term, I think I made a mistake in expanding y.

Wait, let me go back to the correct expression after substitution:

y = t^2 [ - (t^2 /2) cos(2t) + (t/2) sin(2t) + (1/4) cos(2t) + 1/t + 2t^2 ] + C t^2.

At t=π/2:

Inside the brackets:

- ( (π/2)^2 /2 )*(-1) + (π/2 /2)*0 + (1/4)*(-1) +1/(π/2) +2*(π/2)^2.

= (π^2 /8) +0 -1/4 + 2/π +2*(π^2 /4).

= π^2 /8 -1/4 +2/π + π^2 /2.

Combine π^2 terms:

π^2 /8 +4π^2 /8=5π^2 /8.

So,

=5π^2 /8 -1/4 +2/π.

Multiply by t^2=π^2 /4:

y = (π^2 /4)(5π^2 /8 -1/4 +2/π ) + C*(π^2 /4).

Compute each term:

5π^4 /32 ≈15.2195.

-π^2 /16 ≈-0.61685.

2π /4=π/2≈1.5708.

So total:15.2195 -0.61685 +1.5708≈16.17345.

Plus C*(π^2 /4).

Now, using the initial condition y(π)=3π^4 /2.

Compute y(π)= (5/2)π^4 - (1/4)π^2 + π + C π^2.

Set equal to 3π^4 /2:

(5/2)π^4 - (1/4)π^2 + π + C π^2 = (3/2)π^4.

Move (3/2)π^4 to left:

(5/2 -3/2)π^4 - (1/4)π^2 + π + C π^2=0.

Which is:

π^4 - (1/4)π^2 + π + C π^2=0.

Factor π^2:

π^4 + (C -1/4)π^2 +π=0.

This equation can't be satisfied with any real C because π^4 is positive and the other terms can't cancel it out. This suggests I made a mistake in the substitution approach.

Therefore, I must have made a mistake in the substitution. Perhaps I should stick to the earlier method where y(π/2)≈17.86, which isn't an option, so perhaps the correct answer is closest to option C:18.042, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial steps and the correct answer is option E:16.389.

Wait, perhaps I should recalculate the third term more accurately.

Third term: (π^2 /4)(π - 0.5)= (π^3 /4 - π^2 /8).

Compute π^3 ≈31.00627668.

π^3 /4≈7.75156917.

π^2 ≈9.8696044.

π^2 /8≈1.2337.

So, 7.75156917 -1.2337≈6.5178.

So y(π/2)=15.2195 -3.8758 +6.5178≈17.8615.

Hmm, I think I'm confident in this result, but since it's not among the options, perhaps I made a mistake in the integrating factor or the substitution steps. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects an approximate answer, and 17.86 rounds to 18.042, which is option C.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that when I computed y(π/2), I missed a term or included an extra term.

Wait, perhaps I should go back to the initial solution:

y = t^4 (2 - (1/2) cos(2t)) + t^3 ( (1/2 sin(2t) -1) ) + t^2 (1/4 cos(2t) + π - 1/4 ).

At t=π/2:

cos(2t)=-1, sin(2t)=0.

So,

y= (π/2)^4 (2 +0.5) + (π/2)^3*(-1) + (π/2)^2*( -1/4 + π -1/4 ).

= (π^4 /16)(2.5) + (π^3 /8)(-1) + (π^2 /4)(π - 0.5).

Compute each term:

(5 π^4)/32 ≈15.2195.

- π^3 /8 ≈-3.8758.

(π^2 /4)(π -0.5)= (π^3 /4 - π^2 /8 )≈7.7516 -1.2337≈6.5179.

Sum:15.2195 -3.8758 +6.5179≈17.8616.

So, I think this is correct, but since it's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option C:18.042, considering possible approximations or rounding errors.
</think>

To solve the given initial value problem (IVP), we start by rewriting the differential equation in standard linear form and applying the integrating factor method. After finding the general solution, we apply the initial condition to determine the constant of integration. Substituting \( t = \pi/2 \) into the solution yields the value of \( y(\pi/2) \). Despite several checks, the computed value of approximately 17.86 does not match any option exactly. However, considering possible rounding or approximation errors, the closest option is:

**C: 18.042**

Answer: C
