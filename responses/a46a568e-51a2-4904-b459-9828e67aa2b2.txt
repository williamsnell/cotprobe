Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about aesthetics, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let me start by understanding what the question is asking. The question says, "Aesthetics deals with objects that are____." Then there are ten options from A to J.

First, I should recall what aesthetics is. From what I remember, aesthetics is a branch of philosophy that deals with the study of beauty and taste. It's concerned with how we perceive and evaluate art, nature, and other aspects of our environment based on their visual, auditory, or other sensory qualities. So, it's about the appreciation of things that are considered beautiful or have artistic value.

Now, looking at the options:

A: not essential to our existence
B: frequently used in daily life
C: not visible to the human eye
D: only appreciated by experts
E: universally liked
F: unimportant to most people
G: essential for survival
H: essential to our existence
I: rarely viewed
J: universally disliked

I think about what objects aesthetics deals with. Aesthetics isn't just about things we need to survive, so options G and H, which talk about essential for survival or existence, don't seem right. Similarly, F says unimportant to most people, but aesthetics is about things that people do find important in terms of beauty, so F might not be correct.

Option D says only appreciated by experts. That might not be accurate because aesthetics is something the average person can engage with, even if experts have more nuanced opinions. So D is probably not the best choice.

Option E says universally liked. Well, I know that beauty is often considered subjective and can vary widely between cultures and individuals. So something being universally liked might not always hold true. However, aesthetics does deal with things that people generally find pleasing, even if not everyone agrees.

Option B says frequently used in daily life. While we do encounter aesthetic objects daily, like art or design in products, I'm not sure if "frequently used" captures the essence of what aesthetics is about. Aesthetics is more about the appreciation of form and beauty rather than just usage.

Option I says rarely viewed. That doesn't make sense because many aesthetic objects are things we see and interact with regularly.

Option C says not visible to the human eye. That's about things like microwaves or atoms, which are not the focus of aesthetics. Aesthetics deals with things we can perceive, so C is incorrect.

Option A: not essential to our existence. Hmm, this is interesting. Aesthetics deals with things that are nice to have but not necessary for survival. So objects in aesthetics might not be essential but are still valued for their beauty or other qualities. That could make sense. So A might be the right answer because aesthetics is about things that add to our quality of life but aren't required for survival.

Wait, but let me think again. The question is asking what aesthetics deals with. If the objects are not essential, then they are non-essential, which aligns with A. But I'm a bit confused because some aesthetic objects, like functional art, might have a dual purpose, but I think the main point is that aesthetics is about things that are nice to have, not necessary for survival.

So putting it all together, the best option seems to be A: not essential to our existence.
