Okay, so I have this question about public relations tactics and the 'halo effect.' Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on what exactly the halo effect means in this context, but I think it's about how one positive thing can create a favorable impression that affects people's perception of something else. Like, if a company does something good, people might think all their other actions are good too.

The question is asking which PR tactic can provide this halo effect. The options are A through G. Let me go through each one and see which makes sense.

Option A: Placement on TV or radio. That's about getting media coverage, right? If a company is featured on TV or radio, it gets exposure, but does that create a halo effect? I'm not sure. It's more about reaching a broad audience, but maybe not the halo effect specifically.

Option B: Sponsorship. Sponsorship is when a company supports an event, charity, or activity. I think this could create a halo effect because by associating with a positive cause, the company might be seen in a better light. People might remember the good deed and transfer that positive feeling to the company's brand.

Option C: Social Media Advertising. This is paid ads on platforms like Facebook or Instagram. While it can boost visibility, I'm not sure if it directly creates a halo effect. It's more about targeted marketing than building a positive image through good deeds.

Option D: Billboards and Posters. These are visual ads in public spaces. They can increase awareness but again, it's more about direct advertising rather than creating a positive image through善行 (good deeds) that lead to a halo effect.

Option E: Stunts. These are usually attention-grabbing events or actions. A stunts might get a lot of media attention, but unless it's for a good cause, it might not create a halo effect. It's more about creating buzz than building a positive reputation.

Option F: Direct Mail. This is sending physical ads through the mail. It's a direct marketing tactic but doesn't inherently create a halo effect. It's more about reaching specific customers with promotions.

Option G: Email Marketing. Similar to direct mail, it's about sending promotional content via email. Again, not directly linked to creating a halo effect through positive associations.

So, putting it together, sponsorship (Option B) seems like the best fit. When a company sponsors a positive event or cause, it can create a positive image that people associate with the company, leading to the halo effect where they view the company more favorably overall.

The correct answer is B: Sponsorship. Sponsorship can create a 'halo effect' by associating a company with positive events or causes, leading to a favorable perception of the brand.
