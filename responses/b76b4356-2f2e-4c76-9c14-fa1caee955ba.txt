Okay, so I've got this concentration cell problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because electrochemistry isn't my strongest subject. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The cell is a concentration cell, which I remember means it has the same electrodes but different concentrations of the solution. The setup given is Ag | AgNO3 (0.0100 m) || AgNO3 (y) | Ag. So the left side has a known molality, and the right is what we're trying to find.

The measured voltage is 0.0650 V at 25°C. Oh, and the activity coefficients are given as γ± = 1, which simplifies things a bit because I don't have to worry about activity coefficients complicating the Nernst equation.

First, I need to recall the formula for the cell potential in a concentration cell. I think the Nernst equation applies here. The general form is E = (E°cell) - (RT/nF) ln Q, but since it's a concentration cell, E°cell is zero because both electrodes are the same. So the equation simplifies to E = (RT/nF) ln (Q), but wait, I think it might be a negative sign. Let me think: for a concentration cell, the cell potential arises because of the difference in concentrations. The cell reaction is such that the higher concentration will drive electrons through the cell, so the E is positive based on which side is more concentrated.

Wait, maybe I should write the cell reaction. The left side is lower concentration (0.0100 m), and the right is y m. Since it's a concentration cell, the reaction would be Ag(s) dissolving on the side with lower concentration and depositing on the higher. So the cell reaction would be:

Ag (right) + NO3^- → Ag^+ (right) + e^-
But wait, no, wait. The anode is where oxidation happens. So in the left half, if the concentration is lower, maybe it's more likely to oxidize. Or perhaps the higher concentration is the cathode.

Wait, no. Let me think again. In a concentration cell, the more concentrated solution will act as the cathode because the reaction there is reduction. The lower concentration will be the anode, where oxidation occurs. Because the cell wants to equalize the concentrations, so AgNO3 from the higher concentration will be reduced, and the lower concentration will have Ag being oxidized.

So the cell notation is: left (lower conc) | AgNO3 (0.0100 m) || AgNO3 (y) | right (higher conc). So the left is the anode (oxidation), and the right is the cathode (reduction).

So the cell potential E is given by E = (E°cell) - (RT/nF) ln(Q), but E° is zero, so E = (RT/nF) ln (Q), but I might have the sign wrong. Alternatively, I've heard it expressed as E = (0.05916 V / n) * log(Q) at 25°C. Since it's a concentration cell, n is the number of electrons transferred, which for Ag is 1.

So the formula becomes E = (0.05916 V / 1) * log (Q). But wait, what's Q here? Oh, right, Q is the reaction quotient. For a concentration cell, the reaction is:

At the cathode (right side): Ag^+ + e^- → Ag(s)
At the anode (left side): Ag(s) → Ag^+ + e^-

So the overall reaction is Ag^+ (cathode) + Ag(s) → Ag(s) + Ag^+ (anode), which simplifies to Ag^+ (cathode) → Ag^+ (anode). So the reaction is just the transfer of Ag^+ from cathode to anode. Therefore, the expression for Q is [Ag^+] (anode) / [Ag^+] (cathode). But wait, in a concentration cell, which side is which? Because the cell is set up as left || right, so the left is the anode (lower conc) and right is cathode (higher conc). So in the Nernst equation, since the reaction is from cathode to anode, Q would be [Ag^+] (anode) / [Ag^+] (cathode) = (0.0100) / y.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The cell reaction is Ag^+ (cathode) → Ag^+ (anode). So the reaction quotient Q is [Ag^+] (anode) / [Ag^+] (cathode), which would be (0.0100) / y if the anode is the left side. But since the cell is set up as left (0.0100) || right (y), the left is the anode (lower conc), so the Ag^+ is lower on the left. So the reaction is that Ag^+ from the right (higher conc) is moving to the left (lower conc), which would make the cell potential positive.

Wait, but in the Nernst equation, the cell potential E is calculated based on the reaction as written. So if the reaction is Ag^+ (cathode) → Ag^+ (anode), then Q is [Ag^+] (anode) / [Ag^+] (cathode) = 0.0100 / y.

But wait, the standard cell potential E° is zero, so the actual cell potential E is determined by the concentrations. The formula is E = (0.05916/n) * log ( [cathode]/[anode] ), because the cell reaction is cathode (reduction) and anode (oxidation). Wait, no, maybe I should think about the cell notation in terms of the cell potential formula.

The general formula for a concentration cell is E = (0.05916 V / n) * log ( [cathode]/[anode] ), where [cathode] is the concentration at the cathode, and [anode] is the concentration at the anode. Because the cathode is where reduction happens, so higher concentration would be at the cathode, leading to a positive E.

Wait, but in this case, the measured voltage is 0.0650 V, which is positive, so the cell is set up correctly with the higher concentration on the cathode side (right). So [cathode] is y, and [anode] is 0.0100 m. So the log would be log(y / 0.0100) because [cathode]/[anode] is y / 0.0100.

Wait, no, wait. Let me make sure. The reaction is that at the cathode, Ag^+ is reduced, so the cathode is the higher concentration. So the cell potential E is given by E = (0.05916/n) * log ( [cathode]/[anode] ). Since n=1, it's 0.05916 * log(y / 0.0100) = 0.0650 V.

So let me write that equation:

0.05916 * log(y / 0.0100) = 0.0650.

We can solve for log(y/0.0100) by dividing both sides by 0.05916.

log(y/0.0100) = 0.0650 / 0.05916 ≈ 1.10.

Wait, 0.0650 / 0.05916 is approximately 1.10, because 0.05916 * 1 = 0.05916, and 0.05916*1.1 ≈ 0.065076, which is very close to 0.0650. So it's about 1.10.

So log(y/0.0100) ≈ 1.10.

To solve for y/0.0100, we take 10^1.10. Let me calculate that. 10^1 = 10, 10^0.1 ≈ 1.2589, so 10^1.1 ≈ 12.589.

So y/0.0100 ≈ 12.589 → y ≈ 0.0100 * 12.589 ≈ 0.12589 m.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.1255 m, which is very close to 0.12589. So I think the answer is option B.

The problem involves a concentration cell where the measured voltage is 0.0650 V at 25°C. The cell setup is Ag | AgNO₃ (0.0100 m) || AgNO₃ (y) | Ag, with the goal of determining the molality \( y \) of the right-hand half-cell. 

Using the Nernst equation for a concentration cell at 25°C:

\[
E = \frac{0.05916}{n} \log \left( \frac{[\text{cathode}]}{[\text{anode}]} \right)
\]

Here, \( n = 1 \), \( [\text{anode}] = 0.0100 \, \text{m} \), \( [\text{cathode}] = y \), and \( E = 0.0650 \, \text{V} \). Substituting these values:

\[
0.0650 = 0.05916 \cdot \log \left( \frac{y}{0.0100} \right)
\]

Solving for \( \log \left( \frac{y}{0.0100} \right) \):

\[
\log \left( \frac{y}{0.0100} \right) = \frac{0.0650}{0.05916} \approx 1.10
\]

Taking the antilog:

\[
\frac{y}{0.0100} = 10^{1.10} \approx 12.589
\]

Thus:

\[
y \approx 0.0100 \cdot 12.589 \approx 0.12589 \, \text{m}
\]

Comparing with the options, the closest value is \( 0.1255 \, \text{m} \), which corresponds to option B.
