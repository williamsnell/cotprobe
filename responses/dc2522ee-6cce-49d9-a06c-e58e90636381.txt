Alright, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields produced by a charged particle. Let me try to unpack this step by step. Okay, the question says that the electric field at two different points is given, and I need to find the x-coordinate of the particle.

First, let me note down the given information. The electric field at (3.0, 3.0) cm is 7.2 times (4.0 i + 3.0 j) N/C. Let me compute that. 7.2 multiplied by 4.0 is 28.8, so the i-component is 28.8 N/C. Similarly, 7.2 times 3.0 is 21.6, so the j-component is 21.6 N/C. So the electric field at (3,3) cm is (28.8 i + 21.6 j) N/C.

Then, at the point (2.0, 0) cm, the electric field is given as 100 i N/C. So that's straightforward—only an i component, no j component, which might be a clue.

Now, since the particle is positively charged, the electric field vectors should point away from the particle. So, the direction of the electric field at each point should indicate where the particle is located. 

The general formula for the electric field due to a point charge is E = k * q / r² * r̂, where r̂ is the unit vector pointing from the charge to the point where the field is measured. Alternatively, E is proportional to the vector from the charge to the point where E is measured. So, if I can find the direction of E at both points, I can figure out where the charge must be located.

Starting with the first point, (3,3) cm. The electric field is (28.8 i + 21.6 j) N/C. Let me find the direction of this vector. The direction can be found by the angle it makes with the x-axis. The components are 28.8 i and 21.6 j. The ratio of j to i is 21.6 / 28.8 = 0.75. So the angle is tan⁻¹(0.75), which is 36.87 degrees. So the field is pointing in the direction of 36.87 degrees above the x-axis. Since the field points away from the charge, the charge must lie somewhere along the line that's in the opposite direction of this field. So, from (3,3), the charge is in the direction opposite to 36.87 degrees, meaning towards the fourth quadrant relative to (3,3). Hmm, maybe I can represent this as a vector pointing towards the charge from (3,3).

Wait, no. Wait, the electric field points away from the charge, so the charge must lie along the line that starts at (3,3) and goes in the direction opposite to the field vector. So the field is (28.8, 21.6), which is pointing towards the first quadrant. So the charge would be in the direction opposite to that, which would be the third quadrant relative to (3,3). But wait, actually, wait. Let me think again. The electric field direction is away from the charge, so if I'm at (3,3), the field there is (28.8, 21.6). So the charge must be located in the direction opposite to this vector from (3,3). So if the field is pointing in the first quadrant, the charge must be in the direction towards the third quadrant from (3,3). 

Alternatively, maybe a better approach is to model the electric field vectors as pointing away from the charge. So the line connecting the charge to (3,3) should be in the same direction as the electric field vector at (3,3). Wait, no. Wait, the electric field at a point is the direction you'd feel a force if you were a positive test charge. So the field points away from the source charge. So the vector from the charge to (3,3) should be in the same direction as the electric field vector at (3,3). So if the electric field is (28.8, 21.6), which is pointing to the first quadrant, then the charge must lie somewhere along the line that's in the direction opposite to this vector relative to (3,3). So the line from the charge to (3,3) is along (28.8, 21.6). So the charge is at (3 + 28.8 * t, 3 + 21.6 * t), where t is some positive scalar. Wait, no, wait. If the field points away from the charge, then the charge is located at a point such that the vector from the charge to (3,3) is in the direction of the field. So the charge is at (3 - 28.8 * t, 3 - 21.6 * t). Hmm, maybe I should think of it as the charge being along the line that's in the direction opposite to the field vector from (3,3).

Alternatively, perhaps another approach is better. Let me consider that the electric field vectors at both points must point towards the charge. So, if I can find the direction of each field vector, I can find the point where the charge lies along both lines of direction.

So, for the first point (3,3), the field is (28.8, 21.6). The direction is 28.8 i + 21.6 j. So the unit vector is (4/5 i + 3/5 j). So the field is pointing in the direction (4,3). So the charge is located along the line that goes through (3,3) and in the direction opposite to (4,3). So the charge would be in the direction of (3 - 4k, 3 - 3k) for some k > 0.

Similarly, for the second point (2,0), the field is 100 i. So the field is pointing in the positive x-direction. So the charge must be along the line that goes from (2,0) in the direction opposite to the field, which is the negative x-direction. So the charge would be at (2 - 100m, 0) for some m > 0.

Wait, that can't be right because the field's direction depends on the location of the charge relative to the point. So perhaps a better approach is to model the direction of the field vectors as pointing away from the charge, so the charge must lie somewhere such that both field vectors point towards it.

Wait, maybe using the inverse square law. The electric field strength is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the charge. So E is proportional to 1/r². But since the problem gives E at two points, maybe we can find the distance from the charge to each point, and use that to find the location.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to model the position of the charge as (x, y), and then express the electric fields at both points in terms of (x, y). But since we're only asked for the x-coordinate, perhaps we can ignore the y-coordinate and find x.

Wait, but maybe it's better to think in terms of the direction of the field vectors. Let me consider that the field at (3,3) is (28.8, 21.6), which simplifies to (4,3) when divided by 7.2. So the direction is along (4,3), meaning the charge lies along the line that goes from (3,3) in the direction opposite to (4,3). So the line is parametrized as (3 - 4k, 3 - 3k), where k is a positive scalar.

Similarly, the field at (2,0) is (100, 0). The direction is along (1, 0), so the charge must lie along the line from (2,0) in the direction opposite to (1,0), which is the negative x-direction. So the line is parametrized as (2 - m, 0), where m is a positive scalar.

Now, the charge must lie at the intersection of these two lines. So I need to find (x, y) that satisfies both parametrizations.

From the first line: x = 3 -4k, y=3 -3k.

From the second line: x=2 -m, y=0.

So, the point (x, y) must be the same in both. So, y from the first line is 3 -3k, and from the second line, y is 0. So 3 -3k = 0 → k=1.

Substituting k=1 into the first line's x: x=3 -4(1)= -1 cm. Wait, but the options don't include -1 cm as the correct answer. Wait, looking back, option H is -1.0 cm. But let me check if that's correct.

Wait, but let me think again. If I'm at (3,3) and moving in the direction opposite to (4,3), that would take me towards (3 -4k, 3-3k). For k=1, that gives ( -1, 0 ). But that would mean the charge is at (-1, 0) cm. Then, let's check if the field at (2,0) would point towards that charge.

The charge is at (-1,0). The point (2,0) is 3 cm to the right of the charge along the x-axis. The field at (2,0) due to a positive charge at (-1,0) would point away from (-1,0), so towards the positive x-direction, which matches the given field of 100 i N/C. So that's correct.

But wait, let me see if that charge location also gives the correct field at (3,3). The vector from (-1,0) to (3,3) is (4,3). The field should be proportional to that vector. The magnitude would be k*q/(r²), where r is the distance between (-1,0) and (3,3), which is sqrt(4² +3²) =5 cm. So r=5 cm=0.05 m.

The electric field magnitude would be E = (k*q)/(r²). Let's compute the given E at (3,3). The given E is 7.2*(4i +3j) = (28.8, 21.6) N/C. The magnitude is sqrt(28.8² +21.6²) = sqrt(829.44 +466.56)=sqrt(1296)=36 N/C.

So E =36 N/C. Let's compute the same using the formula. E = (k*q)/(r²). Let's compute k*q/(r²) where r=0.05 m. 

Wait, r is 5 cm, which is 0.05 m. So r² =0.0025 m². So E = (k*q)/(0.0025). Let's compute k*q: E *0.0025 =k*q.

Wait, but actually, the direction of the field at (3,3) should be along (4,3). Which it is, because the charge is at (-1,0), so the vector from (-1,0) to (3,3) is (4,3), which is the direction of the field. So that's correct.

But wait, the field at (2,0) needs to be 100 i N/C. Let me compute that. The vector from (-1,0) to (2,0) is (3,0), so the direction is along i. The magnitude of the field is k*q/(r²), where r is 3 cm (0.03 m), so r²=0.0009 m².

So E = (k*q)/(0.0009). From the first calculation, at (3,3), E=36 N/C = (k*q)/(0.0025). So from that, k*q = 36 * 0.0025 = 0.09.

So at (2,0), E = (0.09) / 0.0009 = 100 N/C, which matches the given field. So that's correct. So the charge is at (-1,0) cm, which gives an x-coordinate of -1.0 cm, which is option H.

Wait, but looking back at the options, H is -1.0 cm. So that's the answer. But wait, let me double-check because the options don't seem to include that in the first glance, but let me check again.

Wait, I think the mistake is that I considered the direction of the field as pointing towards the charge, but actually, since the charge is positive, the field points away from it. So the field vectors at both points should point away from the charge. So if the charge is at (-1,0), then at (3,3), the field points towards (3,3) from (-1,0), which is correct. Similarly, at (2,0), the field points towards (2,0) from (-1,0), which is correct. So that seems consistent.

Wait, but another thought: the line from the charge to (3,3) is in the direction of (4,3), so the field at (3,3) is in that direction, which matches the given field. Similarly, the field at (2,0) is along (3,0), which is the direction from (-1,0) to (2,0). So the field is in the i-direction, which matches the given 100i N/C.

So the charge is at (-1,0) cm, so x-coordinate is -1.0 cm, which is option H.

The problem involves determining the x-coordinate of a positively charged particle based on the electric field vectors at two points: (3.0, 3.0) cm and (2.0, 0) cm. The electric field at (3.0, 3.0) cm is given as \( 7.2(4.0 \hat{i} + 3.0 \hat{j}) \, \mathrm{N/C} \), which simplifies to \( (28.8 \hat{i} + 21.6 \hat{j}) \, \mathrm{N/C} \). At (2.0, 0) cm, the field is \( 100 \hat{i} \, \mathrm{N/C} \).

Since the particle is positively charged, the electric field vectors point away from it. This means the charge lies along the line opposite to the field vectors at both points. For the first point, the field direction is \( (4, 3) \), so the charge lies along the line \( (3 - 4k, 3 - 3k) \) for some \( k > 0 \). For the second point, the field is along \( (1, 0) \), so the charge lies along \( (2 - m, 0) \) for some \( m > 0 \).

To find the charge's location, we equate the parametrizations. From the first line, \( y = 3 - 3k \), and from the second line, \( y = 0 \). Solving \( 3 - 3k = 0 \) gives \( k = 1 \). Substituting \( k = 1 \) into the first line gives \( x = 3 - 4(1) = -1 \, \mathrm{cm} \). Thus, the charge is at \( (-1, 0) \, \mathrm{cm} \), and the x-coordinate is \( -1.0 \, \mathrm{cm} \).

This solution is consistent with the given electric fields: at (3,3), the field points towards \( (-1, 0) \), and at (2,0), the field also points towards \( (-1, 0) \). Therefore, the x-coordinate of the particle is \( -1.0 \, \mathrm{cm} \).
