Question:

Which of the following statements about the protein requirement is correct


Options:

A: The protein requirement can be less than the demand.
B: The protein requirement is equal to the demand minus the efficiency of utilization.
C: The protein requirement is equal to the demand divided by the efficiency of utilization.
D: The protein requirement is always higher than the demand.
E: The protein requirement is the same for all individuals regardless of age or health status.
F: The protein requirement is equal to the demand multiplied by the efficiency of utilization.
G: The protein requirement is always the same as the demand.

Okay, so I've got this question about protein requirements and I need to figure out which statement is correct. Let me break it down step by step. 

First, I remember that protein requirements can vary based on different factors like age, health, activity level, and so on. So looking at the options, option E says the requirement is the same for everyone, regardless of age or health. That doesn't sound right because I know athletes or people recovering from illness need more protein. So E is probably wrong.

Now, the question is about how protein requirement relates to demand. I think the requirement is the amount needed to meet the body's needs, considering how efficiently the body uses the protein consumed. I've heard terms like "biological value" or "efficiency of utilization" before. So the formula must involve dividing the demand by the efficiency because if the body isn't very efficient, you need more protein to meet the same demand.

Looking at the options, option C says the requirement is equal to the demand divided by the efficiency. That makes sense because if efficiency is low, you need more protein. For example, if the efficiency is 80%, you'd need 1.25 times the demand. So C seems correct.

Option F says multiplied by efficiency. That would mean if efficiency is 80%, you need less protein, which doesn't fit because higher efficiency would mean less protein needed, but the requirement should be based on meeting the demand regardless. Wait, no, actually, the requirement is how much you need to eat to meet the demand, considering that not all is absorbed. So if you have a demand of X, and your efficiency is E (as a decimal), you need X/E. So yes, C is correct.

Option B says demand minus efficiency. That doesn't make much sense because subtracting efficiency from demand wouldn't account for the actual need properly. Option A says the requirement can be less than demand. That doesn't sound right because if your body needs a certain amount (demand), the requirement should at least meet that, adjusted for efficiency. So A is incorrect.

Option D says the requirement is always higher than demand. That's not true because if efficiency is 100%, the requirement would equal the demand. But since efficiency is usually less than 100%, the requirement would be higher, but it's not always higher because in theory, if efficiency were 100%, they'd be equal. So D is incorrect.

Option G says requirement is always the same as demand. That's only true if efficiency is 100%, which it's not. So G is wrong.

So, after considering each option, the correct one is C: The protein requirement is equal to the demand divided by the efficiency of utilization.

The correct statement is that the protein requirement is equal to the demand divided by the efficiency of utilization, as it accounts for the body's absorption efficiency.

Answer: C
