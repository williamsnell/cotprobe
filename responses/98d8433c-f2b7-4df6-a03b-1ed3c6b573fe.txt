Question:

An eastbound car travels a distance of 40 m in 5 s. Determine the speed of the car.

Options:

A: 12 m/s
B: 11 m/s
C: 10 m/s
D: 16 m/s
E: 6 m/s
F: 9 m/s
G: 7.5 m/s
H: 8 m/s
I: 5 m/s
J: 14 m/s

Okay, so I need to figure out the speed of this eastbound car. The question says it travels 40 meters in 5 seconds. Hmm, I remember that speed is basically how fast something is moving, right? So speed equals distance divided by time. Let me think about that formula.

The formula is speed = distance / time. So I should take the distance, which is 40 meters, and divide it by the time, which is 5 seconds. Let me do that calculation. 40 divided by 5. Wait, 5 times 8 is 40, so 40 divided by 5 is 8. So the speed is 8 meters per second.

Now I need to look at the options given. The options are labeled from A to J. Let me check each one. A is 12, that's too high. B is 11, nope. C is 10, still too high. D is 16, way off. E is 6, lower than 8. F is 9, getting closer. G is 7.5, also close but not 8. H is 8, that's exactly what I calculated. I is 5, too low. J is 14, nope. So the correct answer should be H: 8 m/s.

I don't think I made any mistakes here. The formula is straightforward, and the numbers are simple enough. Yeah, I'm confident that H is the right choice.

The speed of the car is calculated as distance divided by time: 40 m / 5 s = 8 m/s. The correct option is H.

Answer: H
