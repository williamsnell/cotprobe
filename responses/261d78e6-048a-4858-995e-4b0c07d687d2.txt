Question:

This question refers to the following information.
Under the name of Chartist well-meaning inconsiderate men and other misled men have in very many cases, all over the country from the extreme west to the extreme east and from Brighton in the south to nearly the extreme north of Scotland, denounced every man who is not a working man, applied to him, the grossest epithets and most atrocious intentions and conduct, have threatened them with vengeance and in some places, have proposed plans for the seizure and division of their property—numbers of misled men and others of bad character, under the self-denomination of Chartists have gone from place to place and in the most violent manner disturbed and dispersed meetings of various kinds. Your Committee object to the words Household Suffrage since under any honest definition of the words—they would exclude a large majority of the men of these kingdoms—and because they have become reasonably obnoxious to the political portion of the working people.

Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about the Chartist movement. I remember from my history classes that the Chartists were a political movement in Britain, probably in the 19th century. The question is asking about their primary goal.

Looking at the excerpt provided, it's a letter from Francis Place in 1842. He talks about the Chartists denouncing non-working men, using harsh language, and planning to seize property. He also mentions that his committee objects to the term "Household Suffrage" because it excludes a large majority of men. So, the issue here seems to be about voting rights.

The options are A through J, each representing a different goal. Let me go through them one by one.

A: Universal female suffrage. That's about women's voting rights. I don't think the Chartists focused on women; their movement was more about working-class men's suffrage. So probably not A.

B: Equal distribution of wealth. That sounds more like socialist or communist ideas. The Chartists were more about political reform rather than economic redistribution. So maybe not B.

C: Universal male suffrage. This rings a bell. I recall that the Chartist movement was primarily about expanding voting rights. Specifically, they wanted all men, regardless of wealth or property, to have the right to vote. So C seems likely.

D: Universal suffrage. This would include all adults, regardless of gender. But I think the Chartists didn't push for women's suffrage. Theirs was a male-only suffrage movement. So D might be too broad.

E: Universal health care. That's a modern issue, probably not related to the 19th-century Chartists.

F: Universal education. While education was important, I don't think it was their main goal. Their focus was on political rights, specifically voting.

G: Abolition of child labor. Again, more of a later reform, maybe by later movements like the Labour Party, not the Chartists.

H: Establishment of a socialist state. The Chartists were more about democratic reforms rather than a complete overhaul of the economic system.

I: Abolition of monarchy. That's more of a republican goal. The Chartists wanted parliamentary reforms but didn't aim to abolish the monarchy.

J: Social security and unemployment insurance. These are welfare issues that came much later, probably in the 20th century.

So, putting it all together, the primary goal was universal male suffrage, which is option C. The excerpt mentions the issue with Household Suffrage excluding many men, implying they wanted a broader, more inclusive voting system for men.

The Chartist movement primarily aimed for universal male suffrage, as evident from their focus on expanding voting rights for working-class men. This aligns with the excerpt's concern over the exclusionary nature of existing suffrage definitions.

Answer: C
