Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. The question says: "Through what potential must a proton initially at rest fall so that its de Broglie wavelength is 1.0 × 10^-10 meters?" Hmm, I remember that the de Broglie wavelength relates the momentum of a particle to its wavelength. The formula is λ = h / p, where h is Planck's constant and p is the momentum. 

Since the proton is initially at rest, it's starting with zero kinetic energy. When it falls through a potential, it gains kinetic energy. So I think the potential here is the voltage through which the proton is accelerated, which gives it kinetic energy. 

Wait, protons have charge equal to the elementary charge, which is e = 1.602 × 10^-19 coulombs. So if it falls through a potential V, the kinetic energy gained should be eV. Oh, right, because the work done by the electric field is eV. 

But since the proton starts from rest, its kinetic energy (KE) is equal to eV. So KE = eV.

Now, the de Broglie wavelength λ is given by λ = h / (m v), where m is the mass of the proton and v is its velocity after being accelerated. Oh wait, but maybe I can relate the kinetic energy to the velocity. Because KE is (1/2) m v². So KE = eV = (1/2) m v². 

So I can write v = sqrt(2 eV / m). 

Substituting this into the de Broglie wavelength equation, I get λ = h / (m v) = h / (m * sqrt(2 eV / m)) ). Let me simplify that. 

Let me rewrite the denominator: m * sqrt(2 eV/m) = sqrt( m² * (2 eV/m) ) = sqrt( m * 2 eV ). So λ = h / sqrt(m * 2 eV).

Wait, maybe it's easier to square both sides to get rid of the square root. So λ² = h² / (m * 2 e V). 

Then, solving for V, I get V = h² / (m * 2 e * λ²). 

Wait, that seems right. Let me plug in the numbers. 

I know that Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626 × 10^-34 J·s. The mass of a proton m is about 1.67 × 10^-27 kg. The elementary charge e is 1.602 × 10^-19 C. The wavelength λ is 1.0 × 10^-10 m. 

So let's compute V. 

First, compute h squared: (6.626e-34)^2 = let me compute that. 6.626^2 is approximately 43.9, so 43.9e-68 (since (1e-34)^2 is 1e-68). Wait, maybe better to compute exactly: 6.626e-34 squared is (6.626)^2 × (1e-34)^2 = 43.90 × 1e-68 = 4.390e-67 J²·s².

Wait, wait, actually, 6.626 × 6.626 is about 43.9, so yes, 43.9 × 1e-68 = 4.39e-67.

Then m is 1.67e-27 kg. e is 1.602e-19 C. λ squared is (1e-10)^2 = 1e-20 m².

So putting it all into V = (h²) / (m * 2e * λ²):

V = (4.39e-67) / (1.67e-27 kg * 2 * 1.602e-19 C * 1e-20 m²)

Wait, let me compute the denominator first. 

Denominator: m * 2e * λ² = 1.67e-27 * 2 * 1.602e-19 * 1e-20.

Let me compute step by step:

1.67e-27 * 2 = 3.34e-27.

3.34e-27 * 1.602e-19 = let's compute 3.34 * 1.602 ≈ 5.353, and the exponents: 1e-27 * 1e-19 = 1e-46. So 5.353e-46.

Then multiply by 1e-20: 5.353e-46 * 1e-20 = 5.353e-66.

So denominator is 5.353e-66.

So V = (4.39e-67) / (5.353e-66) = ?

Dividing 4.39e-67 by 5.353e-66 is the same as (4.39 / 5.353) * 1e-1. Because 1e-67 / 1e-66 = 1e-1.

4.39 divided by 5.353 is approximately 0.82 (since 5.353 * 0.8 is 4.2824, and a bit more). Let me compute it more accurately: 4.39 ÷ 5.353.

5.353 × 0.82 = 5.353 * 0.8 = 4.2824, plus 5.353 * 0.02=0.10706 → total 4.38946. That's very close to 4.39. So 0.82.

So V ≈ 0.82 * 0.1 = 0.082 volts. Wait, because it's 0.82 * 1e-1, which is 0.082 V.

Looking at the options, J is 0.082 V, which matches. So the answer should be J.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations because sometimes I might have messed up the exponents.

Wait, denominator calculation:

m = 1.67e-27 kg

e = 1.602e-19 C

λ^2 = (1e-10)^2 = 1e-20 m².

So denominator: m*2e*λ^2 = 1.67e-27 * 2 * 1.602e-19 * 1e-20.

Breaking it down:

1.67e-27 * 2 = 3.34e-27.

3.34e-27 * 1.602e-19 = Let's compute 3.34 * 1.602 ≈ 5.353, exponents: 1e-27 *1e-19=1e-46 → 5.353e-46.

5.353e-46 *1e-20 = 5.353e-66.

So denominator is 5.353e-66.

Numerator: h² = (6.626e-34)^2 = (6.626)^2 = approx 43.9, so 43.9e-68 → 4.39e-67.

So V = (4.39e-67) / (5.353e-66) = (4.39 / 53.53) ) * (1e-67 / 1e-66) → Wait, no, wait: 5.353e-66 is 5.353 × 1e-66.

So 4.39e-67 / 5.353e-66 = (4.39 / 5.353) * (1e-67 / 1e-66) = (approx 0.82) * (0.1) = 0.082 V.

Yes, that's correct. So the potential is 0.082 V, which is option J.

The de Broglie wavelength of a proton is given by λ = h / p, where h is Planck's constant and p is the momentum. Since the proton starts at rest and gains kinetic energy by falling through a potential V, its kinetic energy is KE = eV, where e is the elementary charge. Using KE = (1/2)mv², the velocity v can be expressed as v = sqrt(2eV/m). Substituting this into the de Broglie wavelength equation gives λ = h / sqrt(m * 2eV). Squaring both sides and solving for V yields V = h² / (m * 2e * λ²).

Substituting the known values:
- h = 6.626 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s,
- m = 1.67 × 10⁻²⁷ kg,
- e = 1.602 × 10⁻¹⁹ C,
- λ = 1.0 × 10⁻¹⁰ m,

the calculation proceeds as follows:

1. Compute h² = (6.626 × 10⁻³⁴)² ≈ 4.39 × 10⁻⁶⁷ J²·s².
2. Compute the denominator: m * 2e * λ² = (1.67 × 10⁻²⁷ kg) * 2 * (1.602 × 10⁻¹⁹ C) * (1.0 × 10⁻¹⁰ m)² ≈ 5.353 × 10⁻⁶⁶ kg·C·m².
3. Divide h² by the denominator: V = (4.39 × 10⁻⁶⁷) / (5.353 × 10⁻⁶⁶) ≈ 0.082 V.

Thus, the potential V is approximately 0.082 V, corresponding to option J.
