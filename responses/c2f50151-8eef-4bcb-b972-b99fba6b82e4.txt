Question:

In the Tularosa Basin of New Mexico are black lava formations surrounded by light-colored sandy desert. Pocket mice inhabit both areas. Dark-colored ones inhabit the lava formations, while light-colored mice inhabit the desert. Which of the following statements is correct about this scenario?

Options:

A: The light-colored mice evolved from the dark-colored mice over time.
B: The color of the mice is determined by their diet in the lava formations and desert.
C: The two varieties of mice descended from a recent common ancestor.
D: The mouse population was originally one population that diverged into two species because of mutations.
E: Selection favors some phenotypes over others.
F: The two varieties of mice have always existed separately and did not share a common ancestor.
G: Originally the mice were all dark colored. As the lava decomposed into sand, the color of some mice changed because that color was favored in that environment.
H: The mice were originally light-colored, but some darkened over time to blend into the lava formations.

Okay, so I'm trying to answer this biology question about pocket mice in the Tularosa Basin. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand. The setup is that there are black lava formations surrounded by light-colored sandy desert. The pocket mice live in both areas, with dark-colored mice on the lava and light-colored ones in the desert. I need to pick the correct statement from the options A to J.

Hmm. So, the first thing that comes to mind is that this is about natural selection and possibly speciation. The mice have different colors based on where they live, so their coloration must be an adaptation to their environment. That makes me think about how natural selection works, favoring certain traits that improve survival and reproduction.

Looking at the options:

A: The light-colored mice evolved from the dark-colored mice over time. Well, that's possible, but I'm not sure if it's the best answer. It suggests a directional evolution, but maybe it's more about selection favoring different traits in different environments rather than one evolving from the other.

B: The color is determined by their diet. I don't think so. Diet can influence some coloration, but I remember that in many cases, like with peppered moths, it's more about the environment and predators rather than what they eat. Plus, the question doesn't mention diet differences.

C: Two varieties descended from a recent common ancestor. That sounds plausible. If they were one species and then split into two due to environmental pressures, they would have a recent common ancestor. But I'm not sure if this is the most correct statement.

D: The mouse population was one that diverged into two species because of mutations. Hmm. Well, mutations are a source of variation, but divergence into species usually involves more than just mutations; it's about reproductive isolation and different selection pressures leading to different traits.

E: Selection favors some phenotypes over others. This seems directly applicable. In the lava area, dark mice blend in better and survive, while in the desert, light mice do the same. So natural selection is favoring the darker ones in one place and lighter in another. This makes sense.

F: The two varieties have always existed separately and didn't share a common ancestor. That doesn't sound right. Usually, species diverge from a common ancestor, so they must have shared one at some point.

G: Originally, all mice were dark. As lava decomposed, some turned light because the environment favored it. Wait, the lava is black and the desert is light. If lava decomposes into sand, that would make the area lighter over time. But I think natural selection acts on existing variation. Maybe some were already light and survived better as the environment changed. But this option suggests the color change happened after the lava decomposed, which might not be the main point here.

H: Originally, mice were light, some darkened over time to blend into lava. Similar to G but the opposite. Again, maybe selection acted on pre-existing variation rather than a change after the environment changed.

So, evaluating E: Selection is definitely favoring certain phenotypes in each environment. That fits with the idea of natural selection. The dark mice in lava and light in desert are examples of divergent evolution due to different selective pressures.

Other options: C and D talk about divergence, but the question is about which statement is correct about the scenario, not necessarily about the process of speciation. E is more directly about the mechanism of natural selection, which is a correct statement here.

So I think E is the correct answer.

The scenario describes pocket mice in the Tularosa Basin, where dark-colored mice inhabit black lava formations and light-colored mice inhabit the surrounding sandy desert. This suggests that the coloration of the mice is an adaptation to their environment, influenced by natural selection. Among the options:

- **A**: Incorrect, as it implies a unidirectional evolution from dark to light, which isn't supported by the scenario.
- **B**: Incorrect, as the color is likely influenced by environmental pressures rather than diet.
- **C**: Plausible but not the most direct answer, as it focuses on divergence from a common ancestor rather than the mechanism of selection.
- **D**: Incorrect, as divergence into species involves more than just mutations.
- **E**: Correct, as natural selection favors darker mice in the lava and lighter mice in the desert, highlighting the process of selection favoring certain phenotypes.
- **F**: Incorrect, as the mice likely shared a common ancestor before diverging.
- **G** and **H**: Incorrect, as they suggest color changes after environmental changes, rather than selection acting on pre-existing variation.

The most accurate statement is **E**, as it directly addresses the role of natural selection in favoring different phenotypes in different environments.

Answer: E
