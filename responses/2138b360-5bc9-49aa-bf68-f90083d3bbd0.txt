Okay, so I have this question about calculating the effective yield of a bond. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on bond calculations, but let me try to work through it step by step.

The bond in question is a 6 and 3/4% bond with a face value of $1,000. It's purchased at 88 and 3/4. I need to find the effective yield, rounded to the nearest tenth of a percent. The options are given from A to J, so I'll need to compute it accurately.

First, I remember that the effective yield, also known as the current yield, is calculated by taking the annual coupon payment divided by the current market price of the bond. Oh wait, but sometimes it's the yield to maturity, but I think in this case, since it's just asking for effective yield, it's the current yield.

Wait, no, wait. Effective yield is actually the yield to maturity, which takes into account the purchase price, the coupon payments, and the face value at maturity. Or is it the current yield formula? I'm getting a bit confused. Let me clarify.

Current yield is (Annual Coupon / Price) * 100. Yield to Maturity (YTM) is the total return anticipated on the bond if it's held until maturity, including principal, interest, and purchase price. So the question says "effective yield," which I think refers to the current yield. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me check the problem again.

The question says, "What is the effective yield..." and gives the purchase price. Effective yield is usually YTM, but sometimes people use it interchangeably with current yield. Hmm. I might need to compute YTM here because it's more comprehensive.

Wait, the problem mentions "effective yield," which is typically the YTM because it accounts for the time value of money and all cash flows. So I should calculate YTM.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Determine the coupon rate: 6.75% (since 3/4 is 0.75, so 6 + 0.75 = 6.75%).
2. Face value is $1,000.
3. The purchase price is 88 and 3/4, which is 88.75. So the price is 88.75% of face value, which is 0.8875 * 1000 = $887.50.

Now, YTM is the discount rate that equates the present value of the bond's cash flows to its price. The formula is:

Price = (C * (1 - (1 + r)^-n) / r) + (FV / (1 + r)^n)

Where:
- C = annual coupon payment
- r = YTM (as a decimal)
- n = number of periods (years until maturity)
- FV = face value

But wait, I don't know the maturity period. The problem doesn't specify how many years the bond has left until maturity. Hmm, that's a problem. Oh, wait, maybe it's a 6-month period, or is it a standard 10-year bond? Wait, no, the question doesn't mention the term. That seems like a missing piece. Did I miss something?

Wait, the original problem says a 6 (3/4)% bond, which is 6.75%. It's a $1,000 face value bond. The purchase price is at 88(3/4), which is 88.75, so $887.50. But without knowing the time to maturity, I can't compute YTM because the number of periods (n) is unknown.

Wait, perhaps the bond is a U.S. Treasury bond, which typically has a coupon period of six months, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the bond is a 30-year bond, but that's not stated. Wait, perhaps I should assume it's a 6-month period, but that doesn't make sense because the coupon rate is annual. Alternatively, perhaps the bond has a certain standard term, but I don't recall that being specified here.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Perhaps the question is asking for the current yield instead of the YTM, which would only require the annual coupon and the purchase price. Let me try that approach.

Current Yield = (Annual Coupon) / (Purchase Price) * 100.

So, the annual coupon is 6.75% of $1,000, which is 0.0675 * 1000 = $67.50.

The purchase price is 88.75% of $1,000, so $887.50.

So Current Yield = (67.50 / 887.50) * 100.

Let me compute that.

67.50 divided by 887.50. Let's see, 67.5 / 887.5.

First, 887.5 goes into 67.5... Well, 887.5 * 0.076 is approximately 67.5. Let me check:

0.076 * 887.5 = ?

0.07 * 887.5 = 62.125
0.006 * 887.5 = 5.325
Adding them together: 62.125 + 5.325 = 67.45, which is close to 67.50. So 0.076, which is 7.6%.

Wait, but let me calculate more accurately.

Compute 67.5 / 887.5.

First, 887.5 * 0.07 = 62.125
887.5 * 0.075 = 66.5625
887.5 * 0.076 = 67.45 (as above)
887.5 * 0.0762 ≈ 67.50

So 0.0762, which is approximately 7.62%. Rounded to the nearest tenth, that's 7.6%.

Looking at the options, option A is 7.6%, which would be the current yield.

Wait, but earlier I thought effective yield might be YTM, which requires knowing the time to maturity. Since the problem doesn't specify the term, perhaps the question is asking for the current yield instead. Alternatively, maybe the bond is a perpetuity, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the bond has a certain standard term, but without that info, I can't compute YTM.

Wait, perhaps the problem assumes that the bond is purchased at a certain price and has a certain term, perhaps 6 years or something, but that's not stated. Alternatively, perhaps the bond is a 6-month note, but that would have a different calculation. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the question is miswritten, and the term is 6 years. But I don't know. Alternatively, perhaps I should proceed under the assumption that we're calculating current yield, which is 7.6%, option A.

But wait, let me think again. The question says "effective yield," which is more likely YTM. So without knowing the term, I can't compute YTM. Therefore, perhaps the question is actually asking for the current yield, in which case the answer is 7.6%, option A.

Alternatively, perhaps the bond is a 6-month bond, but that would have a coupon rate of 6.75% for 6 months, so 3.375% semi-annual. But that seems inconsistent. Alternatively, perhaps the bond is a 6-year bond, but again, without knowing, I can't compute YTM.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me try to compute YTM with the information given, assuming a certain term. But without knowing n, I can't proceed.

Wait, perhaps the problem has a typo, and the term is given elsewhere, but as presented, it's not there. Alternatively, perhaps the term is 10 years, a common term. Let me try that.

Assume n=10 years.

So, using the YTM formula:

887.50 = (67.50 * (1 - (1 + r)^-10) / r) + (1000 / (1 + r)^10)

This equation needs to be solved for r. Since this is complicated, perhaps I can use trial and error or approximate.

Let's try r=7.6% as a starting point.

Compute 67.50 * (1 - 1/(1.076)^10) / 0.076 + 1000/(1.076)^10.

First, compute (1.076)^10. Let's approximate:

(1.076)^10 ≈ 2.1487 (exact value would require a calculator, but for estimation, it's around 2.15).

So, 1/(1.076)^10 ≈ 0.465.

Thus,

67.50 * (1 - 0.465) / 0.076 = 67.50 * 0.535 / 0.076 ≈ 67.50 * 6.99 ≈ 472.425.

Plus 1000 / 2.1487 ≈ 465.4.

Total ≈ 472.425 + 465.4 ≈ 937.825, which is higher than the price of 887.50. So 7.6% is too low.

Wait, that can't be right because if the price is lower, the YTM should be higher. Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps I should try a higher rate. Let's try r=8%.

Compute (1.08)^10 ≈ 2.1589.

1/(1.08)^10 ≈ 0.463.

So,

67.50 * (1 - 0.463) / 0.08 = 67.50 * 0.537 / 0.08 ≈ 67.50 * 6.7125 ≈ 453.5156.

Plus 1000/2.1589 ≈ 463.19.

Total ≈ 453.52 + 463.19 ≈ 916.71, still higher than 887.50.

Hmm, need a higher r. Let's try 8.5%.

(1.085)^10 ≈ 2.378.

1/(1.085)^10 ≈ 0.420.

So,

67.50 * (1 - 0.420) / 0.085 ≈ 67.50 * 0.58 / 0.085 ≈ 67.50 * 6.8235 ≈ 460.65.

Plus 1000 / 2.378 ≈ 420.3.

Total ≈ 460.65 + 420.3 ≈ 880.95, which is close to 887.50.

So, at 8.5%, the present value is about 880.95, which is a bit less than 887.50. So the actual YTM is slightly less than 8.5%.

Let me try 8.4%.

(1.084)^10: Let's compute it step by step.

1.084^1 =1.084
^2≈1.084*1.084≈1.175
^3≈1.175*1.084≈1.275
^4≈1.275*1.084≈1.383
^5≈1.383*1.084≈1.504
^6≈1.504*1.084≈1.633
^7≈1.633*1.084≈1.780
^8≈1.780*1.084≈1.932
^9≈1.932*1.084≈2.100
^10≈2.100*1.084≈2.276.

So, (1.084)^10 ≈ 2.276.

1/(1.084)^10 ≈ 0.439.

So,

67.50 * (1 - 0.439) / 0.084 ≈ 67.50 * 0.561 / 0.084 ≈ 67.50 * 6.68095 ≈ 451.18.

Plus 1000 / 2.276 ≈ 439.3.

Total ≈ 451.18 + 439.3 ≈ 890.48, which is higher than 887.50. So at 8.4%, the present value is 890.48, which is higher than the price, so the YTM is between 8.4% and 8.5%.

Wait, but earlier at 8.5%, PV was 880.95, which is lower than 887.50. So we need to find r where PV=887.50.

We can set up a linear approximation between 8.4% and 8.5%.

At 8.4%: PV=890.48
At 8.5%: PV=880.95

We need PV=887.50. The difference between 890.48 and 880.95 is 9.53 over 0.1% increase in r.

We need to decrease PV from 890.48 to 887.50, which is a decrease of 2.98.

So, the fraction is 2.98 / 9.53 ≈ 0.312.

So, r ≈ 8.4% + 0.312*(0.1%) ≈ 8.4% + 0.0312% ≈ 8.4312%.

So approximately 8.43%, which is about 8.4% when rounded to the nearest tenth. But looking at the options, option C is 8.2%, D is7.8%, F is8.8%, G is8.6%, H is9.2%, etc.

Wait, but this is assuming a 10-year maturity. The problem didn't specify, so perhaps I'm making an incorrect assumption. Alternatively, perhaps the bond is a 6-year bond. Let me try that.

Assume n=6.

So,

887.50 = (67.50 * (1 - (1 + r)^-6) / r) + (1000 / (1 + r)^6)

Let me try r=7.6%.

Compute (1.076)^6 ≈ ?

1.076^2 ≈1.158
^3≈1.158*1.076≈1.246
^4≈1.246*1.076≈1.338
^5≈1.338*1.076≈1.438
^6≈1.438*1.076≈1.546.

So, (1.076)^6≈1.546.

1/(1.076)^6≈0.646.

So,

67.50*(1 - 0.646)/0.076 ≈67.50 * 0.354 / 0.076 ≈67.50 *4.66 ≈313.65.

Plus 1000/1.546≈647.89.

Total≈313.65 +647.89≈961.54, which is higher than 887.50. So 7.6% is too low.

Try r=8%.

(1.08)^6≈1.513.

1/1.513≈0.660.

So,

67.50*(1-0.660)/0.08≈67.50*0.34 /0.08≈67.50*4.25≈286.875.

Plus 1000/1.513≈660.7.

Total≈286.88 +660.7≈947.58>887.50. Still too high.

Try r=9%.

(1.09)^6≈1.612.

1/1.612≈0.619.

So,

67.50*(1-0.619)/0.09≈67.50*0.381/0.09≈67.50*4.233≈285.33.

Plus 1000/1.612≈620.14.

Total≈285.33+620.14≈905.47>887.50.

Still too high. Let's try r=9.5%.

(1.095)^6≈?

Compute step by step:

1.095^2≈1.199

^3≈1.199*1.095≈1.314

^4≈1.314*1.095≈1.437

^5≈1.437*1.095≈1.575

^6≈1.575*1.095≈1.723.

So, (1.095)^6≈1.723.

1/1.723≈0.580.

So,

67.50*(1-0.580)/0.095≈67.50*0.42 /0.095≈67.50*4.421≈298.01.

Plus 1000/1.723≈580.03.

Total≈298.01 +580.03≈878.04, which is less than 887.50. So YTM is between 9.5% and 10%.

Wait, but this is getting too complicated without knowing the term. Since the problem doesn't specify the term, perhaps the question is indeed asking for the current yield, which is 7.6%, option A.

Alternatively, perhaps the term is 6 years, but even then, the YTM isn't matching any of the options. Alternatively, perhaps the term is 6 months, making this a short-term calculation.

Wait, let me try the term as 6 months, so n=6.

Wait, but that would make the coupon rate 6.75% annually, so semi-annual coupon would be 3.375% per 6 months, with a payment of $33.75 every 6 months.

If the bond is purchased at 88.75, which is $887.50, and has 6 months until maturity, then the cash flows would be $33.75 in 6 months and $1,000 at maturity.

So, the YTM (which would be a semi-annual rate) can be calculated as:

887.50 = 33.75/(1 + r) + 1000/(1 + r).

So, 887.50 = (33.75 + 1000)/(1 + r) = 1033.75/(1 + r).

Thus, 1 + r = 1033.75 / 887.50 ≈ 1.165.

So, r ≈ 0.165, or 16.5% annual rate, which is 8.25% semi-annual. But that seems extremely high for a bond yield, and the options don't have 16.5%. So perhaps this is not the correct approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the term is 6 years, but without the term, I can't compute YTM accurately.

Given this confusion, perhaps the intended answer is the current yield, which is 7.6%, option A.
</think>

The effective yield, in this case, refers to the current yield since the problem does not specify the time to maturity. The current yield is calculated as the annual coupon payment divided by the purchase price. 

1. **Coupon Payment**: The annual coupon rate is 6.75%, so the coupon payment is $67.50 ($1,000 face value × 6.75%).
2. **Purchase Price**: The bond is purchased at 88.75, which is $887.50.
3. **Current Yield Calculation**: 
   \[
   \text{Current Yield} = \left( \frac{67.50}{887.50} \right) \times 100 \approx 7.6\%.
   \]

Thus, the effective yield is **7.6%**, corresponding to option A.

Answer: A
