Okay, so I've got this problem about a sight draft and discounting, and I need to figure out the proceeds. Let me try to break it down step by step because I'm not entirely sure how all these terms work.

First, the problem says Jane Morrow gave a 60-day sight-draft dated May 5 for $255 to Jason Bros. Inc. It was accepted on June 1, and then discounted on July 1 at 5%. I need to find the proceeds after discounting.

Hmm, okay. So a sight draft is like a type of draft that's payable immediately or on presentation, right? But in this case, it's a 60-day sight draft, so the payment is due 60 days after May 5. Let me calculate when that would be. May has 31 days, so from May 5, 60 days later would be July 4, because May 5 to May 31 is 27 days, then June has 30 days, so 27 + 30 = 57 days, then 3 more days into July would make it 60. So the maturity date is July 4.

But the draft was accepted on June 1. Wait, when a draft is accepted, that means the drawee (Jason Bros. Inc.) has agreed to pay the amount when it becomes due. So now, the draft is accepted, and then it's discounted on July 1. Discounting is when a bank or financial institution buys the draft from the holder before its maturity date, charging a discount based on the interest rate.

So the key here is to calculate the discount based on the time between June 1 (the date of discounting) and the maturity date, which is July 4. Let me check how many days that is. From June 1 to July 4: June has 30 days, so from June 1 to June 30 is 30 days, and then July 1 to July 4 is 3 days, making a total of 33 days. But wait, I think when calculating days for interest, sometimes the start and end dates are included differently. Let me clarify: if the draft is discounted on July 1, the period would be from July 1 to July 4, which is 3 days. So the discount period is 3 days.

Wait, no, because the draft was accepted on June 1, so the holder (Jane or someone else) is discounting it on July 1. So the time between July 1 and July 4 is 3 days. So the discount period is 3 days.

The discount rate is 5%. I think the formula for calculating the discount is:

Discount = Face Value × (Discount Rate) × (Time in years)

Since the time is in days, I need to convert it into years. So 3 days is 3/360 years, because banks often use 360 days a year for calculations. Alternatively, sometimes they use 365, but I think in this context, 360 is more likely.

So Discount = $255 × 5% × (3/360)

Let me compute that. 5% is 0.05, so:

$255 × 0.05 = $12.75

Then multiply by 3/360, which is 1/120. So $12.75 × (3/360) = $12.75 × 0.008333... ≈ $0.10625

Wait, that seems very small. Let me check the calculation again. Alternatively, maybe I should calculate the discount as:

Discount = (Face Value) × (Rate) × (Time in days) / 360

So that's $255 * 5% * 3 / 360

Let me compute this step by step:

5% of $255 is $12.75. Then, 3 days over 360 is 1/120, so $12.75 * (3/360) = $12.75 * 0.008333 ≈ $0.10625.

So the discount is approximately $0.11. Therefore, the proceeds would be $255 - $0.11 ≈ $254.89. But looking at the options, none of them are exactly that. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the time period.

Wait, the draft was accepted on June 1, and discounted on July 1. So the time between June 1 and July 1 is exactly 30 days, right? Because June has 30 days. So from June 1 to July 1 is 30 days. But the maturity date is July 4, which is 3 days after July 1. So when discounting on July 1, the time left until maturity is 3 days. So the discount period is 3 days.

Wait, but earlier I thought the discount period is from July 1 to July 4, which is 3 days. So the discount is based on 3 days. So the calculation should be:

Discount = 255 × 0.05 × (3/360) = 255 × 0.000416667 ≈ 255 × 0.000416667 ≈ 0.10625, so $0.10625.

So the proceeds are 255 - 0.10625 = 254.89375, which rounds to about $254.89. The options don't have that exact amount. Let me check the options again.

Options are A:251.94, B:256.50, C:242.75, D:252.94, E:254.94, F:249.94, G:257.94, H:250.00, I:248.94, J:253.94.

Wait, option E is $254.94, which is very close to my calculation. But wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the time period. Maybe the discount period isn't just 3 days but from June 1 to July 1, which is 30 days, and then adding the 3 days. No, no, the discounting happens on July 1, so the time from July 1 to maturity is 3 days. So the discount period is 3 days.

Alternatively, perhaps the time is calculated from the date of discounting, which is July 1, to the maturity date, which is July 4. So that's 3 days.

Wait, but let me think again. The discount is calculated on the number of days remaining until maturity when the discounting occurs. So if discounted on July 1, the maturity is July 4, so 3 days left. So the discount period is 3 days.

So the discount is 255 × 0.05 × (3/360) = 255 × 0.000416667 ≈ 0.10625, so $0.10625.

Subtracting that from 255 gives 254.89375, which is approximately $254.89. The closest option is E: $254.94. Hmm, but there's a difference of about 5 cents, which is probably due to rounding. Alternatively, maybe I should calculate using 365 days in a year.

Let me try that. Using 365 days:

Discount = 255 × 0.05 × (3/365) ≈ 255 × 0.00041096 ≈ 0.1046.

So proceeds would be 255 - 0.1046 ≈ 254.8954, which is still about $254.8954, which would round to $254.90, but again, the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the time period. Let me go back. The draft is accepted on June 1, which is the date when Jason Bros. Inc. becomes the drawee. Then, it's discounted on July 1. So the time between June 1 and July 1 is 30 days, but the discount is calculated from July 1 to the maturity date, which is July 4. So 3 days.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the period from the date of discounting to the maturity date, which is 3 days. So the calculation is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the discount is calculated on the total time from the draft date to the maturity date, but I don't think so because discounting is done on the current holder, and the time is from when the discounting occurs to the maturity.

Wait, another approach: The draft was accepted on June 1, so that's the date the bank (Jason Bros.) becomes responsible. Then, when Jane discounts it on July 1, the bank will calculate the discount from July 1 to the maturity date. So 3 days.

Alternatively, perhaps the time is calculated as the number of days from the date of discounting to the maturity date. So 3 days.

So the discount is $255 × 0.05 × (3/360) = 0.10625, so proceeds are $254.89375.

Looking at the options, E is $254.94, which is very close. But perhaps I made a mistake in the number of days. Let me check the dates again.

Draft date: May 5.

60 days from May 5: May has 31 days, so May 5 to May 31 is 27 days. Then 60 -27 =33 days into June. June has 30 days, so 33 days would take us to July 3 (since 30 days in June + 3 days into July). Wait, that would make the maturity date July 3, not July 4. Did I make a mistake earlier?

Wait, 60 days from May 5: May has 31 days. So from May 5, day 1 is May 5. So day 27 would be May 31. Then day 28 is June 1, day 29 is June 2, ..., day 30 is June 30, day 31 is July 1, day 32 is July 2, day 33 is July 3. So 60 days from May 5 is July 3, not July 4. So the maturity date is July 3.

So if the discounting is on July 1, then the days remaining are July 1 to July 3, which is 2 days. Because from July 1 to July 3 inclusive is 3 days, but the discount is calculated on the days remaining after discounting. So if you discount on July 1, the draft is due on July 3. So the time is 2 days.

Wait, no, the period from July 1 to July 3 is 2 days if we count the start and end dates. Because July 1 is day 1, July 2 is day 2, and July 3 is day 3. So from July 1 to July 3 is 2 days after discounting. Or is it 3 days? I'm a bit confused.

Wait, if I discount on July 1, then the next day is July 2, and the maturity is July 3. So the number of days is 2 days after discounting. So the discount period is 2 days.

So let me recalculate with 2 days.

Discount = 255 × 0.05 × (2/360) = 255 × 0.05 × (1/180) = 255 × 0.000277778 ≈ 0.0708333.

So discount is approximately $0.0708333.

Proceeds = 255 - 0.0708333 ≈ $254.9291667, which is approximately $254.93. Looking at the options, E is $254.94, which is very close. So the answer would be E.

Wait, but earlier I thought the maturity date was July 4, but now I'm seeing that it's July 3. That changes the calculation. So let's confirm the 60 days from May 5.

May has 31 days. So from May 5 to May 31 is 27 days (including May 5). Then, 60 days minus 27 days is 33 days into June. June has 30 days, so 33 days would take us to July 3. So the 60th day is July 3.

So discounting on July 1, the days remaining are July 1 to July 3, which is 2 days. So the discount period is 2 days.

So the discount is 255 × 0.05 × (2/360) = 255 × 0.05 × (1/180) = 255 × 0.000277778 ≈ 0.0708333.

So the proceeds are 255 - 0.0708333 ≈ 254.9291667, which rounds to $254.93. The closest option is E: $254.94.

Alternatively, perhaps the bank includes the maturity date as the last day, so if discounted on July 1, the period is 3 days until July 3. So days = 3.

In that case, discount = 255 × 0.05 × (3/360) = 255 × 0.000416667 ≈ 0.10625.

Proceeds = 255 - 0.10625 ≈ 254.89375, which is approximately $254.89. But the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps the calculation uses 365 days instead of 360. Let me try that.

Using 365 days:

Discount = 255 × 0.05 × (3/365) ≈ 255 × 0.00041096 ≈ 0.1046.

Proceeds = 255 - 0.1046 ≈ 254.8954, which is about $254.8954, still close to $254.90.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct answer is E: $254.94.

Alternatively, maybe I miscalculated the days. Let me check again.

If the draft is accepted on June 1, and it's a 60-day draft, the maturity date is July 3. So if discounted on July 1, the days remaining are 2 days (July 1 to July 3 is 2 days after discounting? Or 3 days including the discount date? Wait, no, discounting happens on July 1, so the time from July 1 to July 3 is 2 days because on July 1, it's day 0, July 2 is day 1, July 3 is day 2. So 2 days.

So discount is 255 × 0.05 × (2/360) = 255 × 0.000277778 ≈ 0.0708333.

Proceeds ≈ 254.929, which is $254.93. The closest option is E: $254.94, which is likely the intended answer.
</think>

The problem involves calculating the proceeds after discounting a 60-day sight draft. The draft was dated May 5, 2023, and accepted on June 1, 2023, with a maturity date of July 3, 2023. It was discounted on July 1, 2023, at a 5% discount rate. The discount period is the number of days from July 1 to July 3, which is 2 days. Using the formula for discounting, the discount is calculated as $255 × 0.05 × (2/360) ≈ $0.0708. Subtracting the discount from the face value gives the proceeds as approximately $254.93. The closest option is **E: $254.94**.

Answer: E
