Okay, so I have this problem here about a pizza parlor that offers 8 different toppings. The question is asking how many ways a customer can order a pizza with 3 toppings. The options are from A to J, and I need to figure out the correct answer.

Hmm, let me think. I remember that when dealing with combinations, the order doesn't matter. So if the pizza toppings are selected without considering the order, it's a combination problem. For example, choosing pepperoni, mushrooms, and olives is the same as choosing olives, mushrooms, and pepperoni for the pizza. So I should use combinations here.

The formula for combinations is n choose k, which is n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose. In this case, n is 8 toppings, and k is 3 toppings.

So plugging in the numbers: 8 choose 3 would be 8! / (3! * (8-3)!)).

Let me calculate that. 8! is 40320, but wait, maybe I can simplify before multiplying everything out. Since 8! = 8×7×6×5!, and the denominator is 3!×5! So the 5! cancels out from numerator and denominator.

That leaves me with (8×7×6) / (3×2×1). Let's compute that. 8×7 is 56, times 6 is 336. Then 3×2×1 is 6. So 336 divided by 6 is 56.

Wait, so the number of ways is 56. Looking at the options, A is 56. So the correct answer should be A.

Just to make sure I didn't make a mistake, let me think again. If there are 8 toppings, choosing any 3, and order doesn't matter, it's definitely combinations. Another way to think about it: the first topping has 8 options, the second 7, the third 6. But wait, that's permutations, right? Because order matters there. So 8×7×6 = 336. But since the order doesn't matter for toppings on a pizza, I have to divide by the number of ways the 3 toppings can be arranged, which is 3! = 6. So 336 / 6 = 56 again. Yep, that's consistent.

The number of ways to choose 3 toppings from 8 is calculated using combinations. The formula is 8 choose 3, which equals 56.
