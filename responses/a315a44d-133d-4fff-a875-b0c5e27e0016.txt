Answer:
    
<think>
Okay, so I've got this question about scaling models for airplanes and testing them in wind and water tunnels. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it step by step.

The question says it's a one-fifth scale model. So the model is 1/5 the size of the actual airplane. I remember that when scaling models, especially for aerodynamics, you have to consider how the Reynolds number scales because that affects the flow conditions.

The problem is asking me to find the tunnel speeds required for both a wind tunnel and a water tunnel so that the model's performance at those speeds corresponds to the full-scale speed of 100 fps at sea level.

First, I'll tackle part (a), the wind tunnel. I think the wind tunnel uses air, so I'll need the properties of air. Let me look at TABLE 2 for the gas properties. Air has a density (rho) of 0.00238 slug/ft³ and a viscosity (mu) of 0.0378 ×10^-5 lb-sec/ft².

For the model, since it's a scale model, the Reynolds number needs to be the same as the full-scale Reynolds number. The Reynolds number (Re) is given by Re = (rho * V * L) / mu, where V is the velocity and L is the characteristic length, like the chord or the wing span. But since the model is scaled down by a factor of 1/5, the length is 1/5th of the actual. However, for Reynolds number, the scaling factors for velocity and length come into play.

Wait, actually, when scaling models, the Reynolds number can change. For similarity, the model and prototype should have the same Reynolds number. So, for the same Reynolds number, the ratio of velocities and lengths must be adjusted. The formula I think is (V_model / V_full) = (L_full / L_model) * (mu_model / mu_full) / (rho_model / rho_full). Wait, no, maybe it's better to write it as Re_model = Re_full.

So Re = (rho * V * L) / mu. For the model, Re_model = (rho_air_model * V_model * L_model) / mu_air_model. But wait, since it's the same air, the density and viscosity are the same as the full scale. Wait no, the model is in the tunnel, which uses the same air as the real airplane at sea level? Or does it? Hmm, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, no, the model is tested in a wind tunnel, so the air properties are the same as the real airplane's environment. Or does it matter? Wait, the question says "at sea level" for the full-scale, so I think the air properties are standard sea level conditions, which are given in TABLE 2 as rho=0.00238 slug/ft³ and mu=0.0378e-5 lb-sec/ft².

Wait, but the model is in the same tunnel, so the air properties are the same as the full scale. So the model's Reynolds number should match the full scale's Reynolds number.

Wait, but the model is scaled down. So the length scale is 1/5, so L_model = L_full /5.

So for the same Reynolds number, Re_model = Re_full.

So, Re_full = (rho_full * V_full * L_full) / mu_full.

Re_model = (rho_model * V_model * L_model) / mu_model.

Since rho and mu are the same (same air), we can write:

(rho * V_full * L_full) / mu = (rho * V_model * (L_full/5)) / mu.

Simplify: V_model = V_full * L_full / (5 * L_full) ) → V_model = V_full /5. So for the same Reynolds number, the model's speed would be V_full /5. But wait, that can't be right because the model is smaller, so the speed should be higher to maintain the same Reynolds number. Hmm, I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, maybe I should think about how Reynolds number scales with model size. Let me think. Reynolds number is proportional to V*L/nu, where nu is kinematic viscosity. For similarity, Re_model = Re_full. So (V_model * L_model) = (V_full * L_full) * (mu_model / mu_full) / (rho_model / rho_full). Wait, but in this case, the model is in the same tunnel, so mu and rho are the same as full scale. So mu_model = mu_full, rho_model = rho_full.

So V_model * L_model = V_full * L_full. Since L_model = L_full /5, then V_model = (V_full * L_full) / L_model = V_full *5. So the model speed would be 5 times the full-scale speed. So V_model = 5 * 100 fps = 500 fps. But wait, looking at the options, option I is 500 fps for part (a), but I'm not sure if I'm missing something.

Wait, but wait, maybe that's not correct. Because if the model is smaller, the velocity in the tunnel has to be higher to maintain the same Reynolds number. So yes, V_model = V_full * (L_full / L_model) ) → since L_model is 1/5, V_model =5* V_full=500 fps.

But wait, another thought: sometimes when you scale down, the Reynolds number isn't the same because the viscosity might scale differently if the fluid is different. But in this case, both the model and the full-scale are in air, so mu and rho are same. So yes, V_model =5 *100=500 fps. So part (a) would be 500 fps. Let's look at the options: option I is 500 for (a), and 34.2 for (b). Option J is 510, 33.2. Option A is 600, 40.2. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, maybe I should check the formula again. Reynolds number similarity requires that:

Re_model = Re_full.

So,

(rho_air * V_model * L_model) / mu_air = (rho_air * V_full * L_full) / mu_air.

Simplify, since rho and mu are same,

V_model * L_model = V_full * L_full.

So,

V_model = (V_full * L_full) / L_model.

But L_model = L_full /5, so,

V_model = (100 * L_full) / (L_full/5) )= 100 *5 =500 fps.

Yes, so part (a) is 500 fps.

Now part (b) is a water tunnel. So the model is tested in water. Now, the model is still a one-fifth scale, but the fluid is water, not air. So the properties of water are different.

So, for the water tunnel, the Reynolds number must match the full-scale Reynolds number in air. Wait, no, because the model is in water, and the full-scale is in air. So the Reynolds numbers for the model and the full-scale are different because they're in different fluids. So how do we approach this?

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the model's speed in the water tunnel such that the model's Reynolds number in water matches the full-scale Reynolds number in air. So we need to equate Re_model_water = Re_full_air.

So let's compute Re_full_air first.

Re_full_air = (rho_air * V_full * L_full) / mu_air.

Given V_full=100 fps, rho_air=0.00238 slug/ft³, mu_air=0.0378e-5 lb-sec/ft².

So Re_full_air = (0.00238 * 100 * L_full) / (0.0378e-5).

But wait, L_full is the actual length, but since we're scaling, perhaps we can write Re_model_water = Re_full_air.

Re_model_water = (rho_water * V_water * L_model) / mu_water.

But L_model = L_full /5.

So,

( rho_water * V_water * (L_full/5) ) / mu_water = (0.00238 * 100 * L_full) / (0.0378e-5).

We can cancel L_full from both sides.

So,

( rho_water * V_water ) / (5 * mu_water) ) = (0.00238 * 100) / (0.0378e-5).

Now, rho_water is from TABLE 1. Let me check TABLE 1 for water. Fresh water has sp gr 1.0, mu is 2.09e-5 lb-sec/ft². So rho_water = sp gr * rho_water, where rho_water is 62.4 lb/ft³ (since fresh water is 62.4 lb/ft³ at 39.2 F, but maybe we can just take 62.4 as rho_water).

Wait, but in the table, it's given as "rho" for gases. Oh wait, TABLE 1 is for liquids. So the rho for water would be 1.0 * 62.4 lb/ft³ = 62.4 lb/ft³.

So rho_water = 62.4 lb/ft³.

mu_water = 2.09e-5 lb-sec/ft².

So,

(62.4 * V_water) / (5 * 2.09e-5) ) = (0.00238 *100) / (0.0378e-5).

Let me compute both sides.

Left side numerator: 62.4 * V_water.

Denominator:5 * 2.09e-5 = 1.045e-4.

Right side numerator: 0.00238 *100 =0.238.

Denominator:0.0378e-5=3.78e-7.

So right side is 0.238 / 3.78e-7 ≈ 629,500.

Left side: (62.4 V_water) / 1.045e-4 = (62.4 /1.045e-4) * V_water ≈ 62.4 / 0.0001045 ≈ 62.4 * 9572 ≈ 62.4 * ~9572 ≈ let's compute 62.4 * 9572 = ?

Wait, perhaps I should compute 62.4 / 0.0001045 first.

Wait, 62.4 / 0.0001045 = 62.4 / 1.045e-4 = 62.4 / (1.045 *1e-4) )= (62.4 /1.045) ) * 1e4 ≈ 59.71 * 1e4 ≈597,100.

So 597,100 * V_water = 629,500.

So V_water ≈ 629,500 /597,100 ≈ approximately 1.0545 fps.

Wait, that seems way too low. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should recalculate more carefully.

Let me do the right side first:

(0.00238 * 100) / (0.0378e-5) = (0.238) / (3.78e-7) = 0.238 / 0.000000378 ≈ 629,500.

Left side:

(62.4 * V_water) / (5 * 2.09e-5) ) = (62.4 * V_water) / (1.045e-4) ) = (62.4 /1.045e-4) ) * V_water.

Compute 62.4 /1.045e-4:

62.4 / 0.0001045 ≈ let's compute 62.4 / 0.0001045.

Let me compute 62.4 / 0.0001045:

Divide numerator and denominator by 0.0001:

62.4 /0.0001045 = 624000 / 1.045 ≈ 624000 /1.045 ≈ let's compute 1.045 * 600,000 = 627,000. So 624,000 would be 600,000 - 3,000.

So 600,000 /1.045 ≈ 574,000.

Wait, perhaps a better approach: 1.045 * 597,000 = ?

1.045 * 597,000 = (1 *597000) + (0.045 *597000) = 597000 + 26,865 = 623,865.

That's close to 624,000. So 597,000 *1.045=623,865. So 624,000 ≈ 597,000 *1.045 + 135.

So 624,000 ≈597,000 + (135/1.045) ≈597,000 +129.2≈597,129.2.

So 624,000 ≈597,129.2 → 597,129.2 ≈ 624,000 → wait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me just do the division:

62.4 / 0.0001045 = 62.4 / 1.045e-4 = (62.4 /1.045) ) * 1e4.

62.4 /1.045 ≈59.71.

So 59.71 *1e4=597,100.

So left side: 597,100 * V_water = right side 629,500.

Thus, V_water=629,500 /597,100≈1.0545 fps.

Wait, but that's about 1.05 fps, which seems way too slow. That can't be right because water is more viscous than air, so the model would need a lower speed to match Reynolds number.

Wait, but I thought when scaling to a smaller model in a more viscous fluid, you need to increase speed, but maybe I'm getting it wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in setting up the equation.

Wait, perhaps I should think again. The model is in water, but the full scale is in air. So the Reynolds numbers are different. But the question says to find the tunnel speed in water such that it corresponds to the full scale speed of 100 fps. Wait, perhaps I misunderstood the question.

Wait, the question says: "Calculate the tunnel speeds required to correspond to a full-scale speed of 100 fps at sea level."

So perhaps the model's speed in the tunnel (water or air) should result in the same dynamic pressure or something else. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's about dynamic similarity, where the model's Reynolds number in the tunnel matches the full-scale Reynolds number in air.

Alternatively, perhaps the model's speed in water needs to be such that the Reynolds number in water is the same as the Reynolds number in air for the full-scale airplane.

Wait, that's what I was trying earlier. So let me recheck the calculations.

Another approach: Compute Re_full for the full-scale airplane in air.

Re_full = (rho_air * V_full * L_full) / mu_air.

Similarly, Re_model_water = (rho_water * V_water * L_model) / mu_water.

Set Re_model_water = Re_full.

So,

(rho_water * V_water * (L_full/5)) / mu_water = (rho_air * V_full * L_full) / mu_air.

Cancel L_full from both sides:

(rho_water * V_water) / (5 * mu_water) ) = (rho_air * V_full) / mu_air.

Solve for V_water:

V_water = [ (rho_air * V_full *5 * mu_water) / mu_air ] * (1 / rho_water).

Now plug in the numbers.

rho_air = 0.00238 slug/ft³.

V_full=100 fps.

mu_air=0.0378e-5 lb-sec/ft².

mu_water=2.09e-5 lb-sec/ft².

rho_water=62.4 lb/ft³.

So,

V_water = (0.00238 * 100 *5 * 2.09e-5 ) / (0.0378e-5 *62.4 ).

Compute numerator: 0.00238 *100=0.238. 0.238 *5=1.19. 1.19 *2.09e-5≈1.19 *0.0000209≈0.00002497.

Denominator:0.0378e-5 *62.4= (0.0378 *62.4)*e-5.

0.0378 *62.4≈2.36.

So denominator≈2.36e-5.

So V_water≈0.00002497 / 2.36e-5 ≈≈0.00002497 /0.0000236≈≈1.058 fps.

Wait, that's about 1.06 fps, which seems extremely low. That can't be right because water is more viscous, so the model would need a lower speed to match the Reynolds number. But 1.06 fps is way too slow. Maybe I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I should not have divided by rho_water, but maybe I messed up in the algebra.

Let me re-derive the formula.

From Re_model_water = Re_full_air.

So,

(rho_water * V_water * L_model) / mu_water = (rho_air * V_full * L_full) / mu_air.

L_model = L_full /5.

So,

rho_water * V_water * (L_full/5) / mu_water = rho_air * V_full * L_full / mu_air.

Cancel L_full:

rho_water * V_water / (5 * mu_water) ) = rho_air * V_full / mu_air.

Solve for V_water:

V_water = [ (rho_air * V_full *5 * mu_water) / (mu_air * rho_water) ) ].

Wait, no, rearranging:

V_water = [ (rho_air * V_full *5 * mu_water) / (mu_air * rho_water) ) ].

Wait, no, let's solve for V_water.

Multiply both sides by 5 * mu_water:

rho_water * V_water = (rho_air * V_full *5 * mu_water * L_full) / (mu_air * L_full).

Wait, no, I think I'm getting confused. Let me write it again.

From:

(rho_water * V_water) / (5 * mu_water) ) = (rho_air * V_full) / mu_air.

Multiply both sides by 5 * mu_water:

rho_water * V_water = 5 * mu_water * (rho_air * V_full) / mu_air.

Then,

V_water = [5 * mu_water * rho_air * V_full ] / (mu_air * rho_water).

Now plug in the numbers:

mu_water =2.09e-5 lb-sec/ft².

mu_air =0.0378e-5 lb-sec/ft².

rho_air=0.00238 slug/ft³.

rho_water=62.4 lb/ft³.

V_full=100 fps.

So,

V_water = [5 * 2.09e-5 * 0.00238 * 100 ] / (0.0378e-5 *62.4).

Compute numerator:

5 *2.09e-5 =1.045e-4.

1.045e-4 *0.00238= approx 2.482e-7.

2.482e-7 *100=2.482e-5.

Denominator: 0.0378e-5 *62.4 =0.0378 *62.4 *1e-5.

0.0378 *62.4 ≈2.36.

So denominator≈2.36e-5.

So,

V_water=2.482e-5 /2.36e-5≈≈1.0518 fps.

Again, about 1.05 fps. That seems way too low. But perhaps that's correct because water is much more viscous. So the model would need to be tested at a very low speed in water to match the Reynolds number of the full-scale airplane in air.

Looking back at the options, part (b) is the water tunnel speed. Let me check the options:

A: 600, 40.2
B:450,35.2
C:550,38.2
D:480,32.2
E:400,30.2
F:520,36.2
G:470,31.2
H:430,28.2
I:500,34.2
J:510,33.2

Wait, none of the options have part (b) as around 1.05 fps. The lowest part (b) is 28.2 in option H. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I confused the model and full-scale in the Reynolds number equation. Maybe I should set Re_model in water to match Re_full in water, but that doesn't make sense because the full scale is in air.

Wait, perhaps the question is not about Reynolds number similarity but about dynamic pressure or something else. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the model's speed in the water tunnel should correspond to the same Mach number or something else, but that's more relevant for air. Alternatively, perhaps it's about dynamic similarity in terms of velocity, considering the scale factor.

Wait, perhaps the model's speed in the water tunnel is determined by scaling the full-scale speed by the square root of the scale factor, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: The model is scaled by 1/5 in linear dimensions. So, in dynamic similarity, the velocity scales with the inverse of the scale factor. But that's only when the Reynolds numbers are the same, which brings me back to the earlier approach.

Alternatively, maybe the question is simpler. Since it's a one-fifth scale model, the speed in the tunnel would be 5 times the full-scale speed. So for air, part (a) would be 500 fps, which matches option I's part (a). But for water, perhaps we have to consider the kinematic viscosity.

Wait, but let's think about dynamic similarity. For dynamic similarity, the model and prototype must have the same Reynolds number. So for the water tunnel, the model's Reynolds number in water must equal the prototype's Reynolds number in air.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the Reynolds number for the full-scale airplane in air.

Re_full_air = (rho_air * V_full * L_full) / mu_air.

And for the model in water, Re_model_water = (rho_water * V_water * L_model) / mu_water.

Set Re_model_water = Re_full_air.

So,

(rho_water * V_water * (L_full/5)) / mu_water = (rho_air * 100 * L_full) / mu_air.

Cancel L_full,

(rho_water * V_water) / (5 * mu_water) ) = (rho_air *100) / mu_air.

Now solve for V_water.

So,

V_water = [ (rho_air *100) / mu_air *5 * mu_water ] / rho_water.

Plugging in the numbers:

rho_air=0.00238 slug/ft³.

mu_air=0.0378e-5 lb-sec/ft².

mu_water=2.09e-5 lb-sec/ft².

rho_water=62.4 lb/ft³.

So,

V_water = [ (0.00238 *100) / (0.0378e-5) ) *5 *2.09e-5 ] /62.4.

Compute numerator:

0.00238 *100=0.238.

0.238 /0.0378e-5 =0.238 /0.000000378≈629,500.

Multiply by5: 629,500 *5=3,147,500.

Multiply by2.09e-5:3,147,500 *0.0000209≈65.78.

Divide by62.4:65.78 /62.4≈1.054 fps.

Again, same result. So part (b) is about 1.05 fps, but the options don't have this. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I'm using the wrong units. Let me check the units.

rho_air is in slug/ft³. mu_air in lb-sec/ft².

rho_water is in lb/ft³, but we need to convert it to slug/ft³ because the units for rho in Reynolds number must be compatible. Wait, because in the Reynolds number formula, rho is in mass density, but slug is mass.

Wait, 1 slug = 32.174 lb. So rho_water in slug/ft³ is 62.4 lb/ft³ /32.174 lb/slug ≈1.938 slug/ft³.

Ah! I see. I used rho_water as 62.4 lb/ft³, but in the Reynolds number formula, it should be in slug/ft³. So I made a mistake there.

So rho_water =62.4 lb/ft³ =62.4 /32.174 ≈1.938 slug/ft³.

So now, let me recalculate V_water.

V_water = [ (0.00238 *100) / (0.0378e-5) ) *5 *2.09e-5 ] / rho_water.

rho_water=1.938 slug/ft³.

So,

V_water = [ (0.238 /0.000000378) *5 *0.0000209 ] /1.938.

Compute:

0.238 /0.000000378 ≈629,500.

629,500 *5=3,147,500.

3,147,500 *0.0000209≈65.78.

65.78 /1.938≈34.0 fps.

Ah! Now that makes sense. So part (b) is approximately 34 fps.

So looking at the options, option I is (500,34.2). So part (a)=500, part (b)=34.2, which is option I.
</think>

To determine the tunnel speeds required for a one-fifth scale airplane model to correspond to a full-scale speed of 100 fps at sea level, we analyze both the wind tunnel and water tunnel scenarios.

### Part (a): Wind Tunnel (Air)
The model is tested in air, and the Reynolds number must match that of the full-scale airplane. Using the formula for Reynolds number similarity:

\[
\text{Re}_{\text{model}} = \text{Re}_{\text{full-scale}}
\]

\[
\frac{\rho_{\text{air}} \cdot V_{\text{model}} \cdot L_{\text{model}}}{\mu_{\text{air}}} = \frac{\rho_{\text{air}} \cdot V_{\text{full}} \cdot L_{\text{full}}}{\mu_{\text{air}}}
\]

Since \( L_{\text{model}} = \frac{L_{\text{full}}}{5} \), the velocity scales as:

\[
V_{\text{model}} = 5 \cdot V_{\text{full}} = 5 \cdot 100 = 500 \, \text{fps}.
\]

### Part (b): Water Tunnel
For the water tunnel, the Reynolds number of the model in water must match the full-scale Reynolds number in air. The formula is:

\[
\frac{\rho_{\text{water}} \cdot V_{\text{water}} \cdot L_{\text{model}}}{\mu_{\text{water}}} = \frac{\rho_{\text{air}} \cdot V_{\text{full}} \cdot L_{\text{full}}}{\mu_{\text{air}}}
\]

Substituting \( L_{\text{model}} = \frac{L_{\text{full}}}{5} \), we solve for \( V_{\text{water}} \):

\[
V_{\text{water}} = \frac{\rho_{\text{air}} \cdot V_{\text{full}} \cdot 5 \cdot \mu_{\text{water}}}{\mu_{\text{air}} \cdot \rho_{\text{water}}}.

Using the given values:
- \( \rho_{\text{air}} = 0.00238 \, \text{slug/ft}^3 \),
- \( \mu_{\text{air}} = 0.0378 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{lb-sec/ft}^2 \),
- \( \rho_{\text{water}} = 1.938 \, \text{slug/ft}^3 \) (converted from \( 62.4 \, \text{lb/ft}^3 \)),
- \( \mu_{\text{water}} = 2.09 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{lb-sec/ft}^2 \),
- \( V_{\text{full}} = 100 \, \text{fps} \),

\[
V_{\text{water}} = \frac{(0.00238 \cdot 100 \cdot 5 \cdot 2.09 \times 10^{-5})}{(0.0378 \times 10^{-5} \cdot 1.938)} \approx 34.0 \, \text{fps}.
\]

### Final Answer
The tunnel speeds required are approximately **500 fps** for the wind tunnel and **34.0 fps** for the water tunnel, corresponding to **Option I**.
