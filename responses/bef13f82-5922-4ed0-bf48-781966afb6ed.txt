Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about Homo erectus, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let's break it down step by step.

First, I'll read the question again: "Homo erectus was:" with options A through J. I'm a bit rusty on my prehistory, but I remember some key points about Homo erectus from my studies.

Homo erectus is an extinct species of hominid, right? I think they were around a long time ago, maybe from about 1.9 million years ago up until about 70,000 years ago. That's a pretty long time, so I wonder if that relates to option A, which says "a stable, long-lived species." Long-lived in terms of duration makes sense if they existed for over a million years, but I'm not sure if "stable" is the right term. Stable might imply they didn't change much, but I think Homo erectus did evolve some subspecies and eventually led to modern humans.

Option B says "the first hominid to stand 'erect' and walk upright." Wait, Homo erectus literally means "man who stands up," so that's a strong hint. I'm pretty sure they were the first to walk fully upright, so B might be correct. But I should check the other options too.

Option C: "a hominid species that was completely herbivorous." I don't think so. From what I remember, Homo erectus was more of a generalist, eating both plants and meat. They were probably omnivores, not strictly herbivorous. So C is likely incorrect.

Option D: "the first hominid to develop agriculture." No way. Agriculture developed much later, around 10,000 years ago, and Homo erectus was already extinct by then. So D is wrong.

Option E: "an unsuccessful, short-lived species." Well, they lasted for a very long time, so E is incorrect. They were quite successful in terms of survival and evolution.

Option F: "a hominid species that lived primarily in trees." I don't think so. Homo erectus was definitely a ground dweller, adapted to walking upright on the savannas, not living in trees like earlier hominids such as Australopithecus.

Option G: "a species that coexisted with modern humans." Modern humans, Homo sapiens, appeared around 200,000 years ago. Homo erectus went extinct around 70,000 years ago, so they didn't coexist with modern humans. So G is incorrect.

Option H: "the first hominid to develop complex language." I'm not sure about this. I think the development of complex language is more associated with Homo sapiens, or perhaps even later. Homo erectus might have had some form of basic communication, but complex language might have come later. So H is probably not correct.

Option I: "the first hominid to make and use stone tools." I remember that Homo erectus is credited with creating the Acheulean tools, which are more advanced than the earlier Oldowan tools. So yes, they were the first to make and use more complex stone tools, which makes I a contender.

Wait, so both B and I are looking good. So which one is the correct answer? Let me think again. The question says "Homo erectus was:" and each option is a characteristic.

Looking back, the question is a single correct answer. So I need to see which of these is accurate.

Option B is about walking upright, which is correct because Homo erectus is known for their fully bipedal stance. But wait, wasn't walking upright something that happened earlier? Like, some earlier hominids like Australopithecus were bipedal. Oh, wait! No, the ability to walk fully upright and have a similar body structure to modern humans is more associated with Homo erectus. So B is correct in that sense.

Option I says they were the first to make and use stone tools. That's also correct because they developed the Acheulean tool industry, which was an important step. But wait, wasn't it Homo habilis who made the first stone tools? Or was Homo erectus the first to make more advanced tools?

I think Homo habilis is often called the "handy man" and is associated with the earliest stone tools, the Oldowan tools. Homo erectus then made more sophisticated tools like the Acheulean hand axes. So if the question is about the first to make stone tools, it's Homo habilis, but if it's about the first to make and use more complex tools, then it's Homo erectus.

But the option I says "the first hominid to make and use stone tools." So if Homo habilis is considered a hominid (which they are), then I would be incorrect because they were earlier. So maybe I is not correct. Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing.

Wait, the options are about Homo erectus. So the question is, which of these describes Homo erectus. So option I says Homo erectus was the first to make and use stone tools. But if Homo habilis was earlier, then I is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering that Homo erectus was the first to make and use stone tools in a more advanced way, but not necessarily the very first.

So if the question is about the first hominid to make stone tools, the answer would be Homo habilis, not Homo erectus. Therefore, option I is incorrect because it's not the first, but Homo erectus did make and use stone tools, so perhaps the question is considering that they were the first to do so, but that's not accurate.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me try to clarify:

- Homo habilis (around 2.5 million years ago) is associated with the earliest stone tools (Oldowan).
- Homo erectus (about 1.9 million years ago) developed more advanced tools (Acheulean).

So if the question is about the first hominid to make and use stone tools, the answer would be Homo habilis, not Homo erectus. Therefore, option I is incorrect for this question, as it's referring to Homo erectus.

So going back, the correct answer would be B: the first hominid to stand "erect" and walk upright. Because while earlier hominids like Australopithecus were bipedal, Homo erectus had a more modern gait and body structure, making them the first to walk fully upright in a manner similar to modern humans.

Wait, but I thought Australopithecus already walked upright. So is B correct? Or is it that Homo erectus was the first to have a more modern form of upright walking?

Yes, I think the key here is that Homo erectus is considered the first hominid to have a fully modern erect posture, with longer legs, shorter arms, and a more efficient bipedal gait. So option B is correct.

So, putting it all together, the correct answer is B.

Homo erectus is best known for being the first hominid to stand erect and walk upright in a manner similar to modern humans, with a fully bipedal posture and modern gait. This makes option B correct. While Homo erectus did use stone tools, they were not the first hominids to do so, as Homo habilis preceded them. Therefore, the correct answer is:

B
