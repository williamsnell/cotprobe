Okay, so I have this question about Feinberg and his views on happiness. I'm a bit rusty on my philosophy, but I'll try to think it through. I remember that Feinberg is associated with the pursuit of happiness, but I'm not exactly sure about the details.

The question is asking what Feinberg claims is the best way to pursue happiness. The options are A through J. Let me go through them one by one.

Option A is striving for success. I think success is often linked with happiness in some theories, but I'm not sure if Feinberg specifically says that. It might be more about the process than just success.

Option B is pursue knowledge. Knowledge is important, but I don't recall Feinberg emphasizing knowledge as the main path to happiness. More about emotions maybe?

Option C is pursue happiness. Wait, that's a bit circular. The question is about the best way to pursue happiness, so if the answer is to pursue it, that seems too direct. Maybe it's more about the means, not the end itself.

Option D is focus on material wealth. Materialism isn't really what Feinberg is about, I think. He's more about intrinsic values.

Option E is none of the above. That's a possibility if none of the other options fit.

Option F is help others to be happy. Altruism is a big part of some happiness theories. Feinberg might think that helping others contributes to one's own happiness, but is that the best way?

Option G is forget about happiness. That sounds counterintuitive. Why would you forget about it if you're trying to pursue it?

Option H is live in the moment. That's more of a mindfulness approach, maybe related to some philosophers, but not sure about Feinberg.

Option I is avoid pain. Pain avoidance is part of minimizing suffering, but again, not sure if that's the main way Feinberg suggests for happiness.

Option J is pursue pleasure. Pleasure is a common goal, but I think Feinberg might have a more nuanced view, perhaps distinguishing between different kinds of pleasures or valuing other aspects over just pleasure.

Wait, I think Feinberg's philosophy emphasizes that the pursuit of happiness is the best means to achieve it. So the best way isn't to focus on something else, but to directly aim for happiness. So the answer might be E because the other options don't quite capture his view accurately. Or maybe it's C, but that seems too straightforward.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. Feinberg is known for his work on the definition of happiness and the paradox of hedonism. He suggests that the best way to be happy is to not make happiness the sole goal, but to focus on other things that contribute to it. So maybe the answer is E because none of the options A-J directly capture that nuance. Alternatively, if the option says "pursue happiness" (C), that might be too simplistic, as Feinberg points out the paradox that focusing solely on happiness can be counterproductive.

So perhaps the correct answer is E, none of the above, because Feinberg's view is more about the paradox and the indirect means, not a direct pursuit.

The question asks about Feinberg's view on the best way to pursue happiness. After considering the options, it seems Feinberg's perspective is more nuanced, suggesting that directly pursuing happiness can be counterproductive. Therefore, none of the provided options accurately capture his view.

Answer: E
