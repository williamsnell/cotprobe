Alright, I'm trying to figure out the answer to this question about Mayan art and iconography. The question is asking what the last character of their art prominently features. The options are A through I, each representing different themes.

First, I remember that Mayan culture was highly sophisticated, with a strong emphasis on astronomy, religion, and their calendar. Their art often depicted figures from their mythology, such as gods and deities. I'm trying to recall specific examples. For instance, I think Mayan art frequently includes glyphs, which are their writing system, and these are often part of larger compositions in their art.

Looking at the options, A is mutilation and violence. I'm not sure if that's a primary theme. B is stars and comets, which makes sense because astronomy was important to them, so they might depict celestial events. C is infants and children; I don't recall that being a major theme in their art. D is modern technologies, which doesn't make sense because the Mayans didn't have modern tech. E is domesticated animals—Mayans had animals like jaguars, but I'm not sure if they were a prominent feature. F is love and sex; I don't think that's a common theme in their art. G is landscapes and sceneries—maybe, but I'm not certain. H is everyday household activities, which seems more like a later Mesoamerican culture, perhaps. I is abstract geometric shapes; I don't think that's it.

Wait, I think I'm mixing up some Mesoamerican cultures. The Aztecs might have more abstract or different themes. The Mayans were more into their calendar, gods, and possibly celestial events. So stars and comets (B) could be a good fit because they were keen observers of the sky.

Alternatively, another thought: Mayan art often includes figures in profile, with intricate headdresses and other symbolic elements. They also depicted their rulers and historical events. But the question is about the last character, which might refer to the main or most prominent feature.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The Mayan glyphs are a key part of their art, and these glyphs often include symbols that represent their writing, which might be more abstract or geometric. So perhaps I, abstract geometric shapes, is the answer. But I'm not entirely sure. Or maybe the answer is B because they tracked the stars for their calendar.

I'm a bit torn between B and I. I think the glyphs are a major part, so I might lean towards I, abstract geometric shapes. But I'm not 100% certain. Alternatively, the question might be about the main subjects, which could be more about deities and events, not the shapes themselves. Hmm.

Wait, another angle: the question says "iconography prominently feature." Iconography refers to the conventional representations in art. The Mayans used a lot of symbolic and often geometric designs in their glyphs and patterns. So maybe the abstract geometric shapes (I) are prominent in their art as part of their writing and decorative elements.

But I'm still not entirely confident. Maybe I should think about examples. For instance, Mayan vases, sculptures, and codices often have intricate designs, including geometric patterns. So I think the answer is I.

The answer is I: abstract geometric shapes.

The Mayan art and iconography prominently feature depictions of abstract geometric shapes, which are integral to their intricate designs and symbolic representations in their art.
