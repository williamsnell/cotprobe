Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here about the principle inorganic compound found in living things. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my biology, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking about the principle inorganic compound. Wait, inorganic compounds are those that don't contain carbon, right? Or do they? No, wait, I think inorganic compounds can contain carbon, but organic compounds specifically are those that are based on carbon. So inorganic would exclude things like glucose, which is definitely organic. So looking at the options, J is glucose, which I can eliminate because it's organic.

The options are A: oxygen, B: calcium, C: carbon, D: potassium, E: phosphorus, F: water, G: sulfur, H: hydrogen, I: nitrogen, J: glucose.

Wait, the question is about the compound, not just the element. So I'm thinking about what the main inorganic compounds are in living organisms. The big ones are water, carbon dioxide, and maybe salts like sodium chloride or things with potassium and other minerals. Since the question is about the principle compound, I think water is the most abundant. So option F is water.

But wait, carbon is an element, not a compound. So if the question is about compounds, carbon by itself isn't a compound. Carbon is an element, so it's not the answer. Similarly, oxygen is an element, so maybe not the compound. Water is H2O, which is a compound, so F seems right.

Let me double-check. The principle inorganic compound in living things is water. Yeah, I remember that about 60-70% of the human body is water, so that's the main one. Other options like calcium, potassium, phosphorus are elements found in compounds, like bones have calcium, but the compound itself would be something else. So the primary inorganic compound is water.

The principle inorganic compound found in living things is water, as it is the most abundant and essential compound for life. 

Answer: F
