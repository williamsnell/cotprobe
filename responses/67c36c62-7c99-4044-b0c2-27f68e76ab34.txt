Okay, so I've got this question about the wave function of a 2P_Z electron when the angle away from the Z axis increases. Hmm, let's see. I remember from my chemistry class that atomic orbitals have different shapes depending on their type—s, p, d, f, etc. The P orbitals specifically are called p_x, p_y, and p_z, each aligned along different axes.

The question is about the 2P_Z orbital. I think the wave function for a p orbital has a certain angular dependence. I recall that the wave function for p orbitals is proportional to sinθ, where θ is the polar angle from the Z axis. So, for example, the 2P_Z orbital's wave function might involve something like sinθ multiplied by some other factors, maybe involving the azimuthal angle φ, but since the question is about changing θ, I can focus on that part.

As the angle θ increases away from the Z axis (which is at θ=0), θ approaches 90 degrees. The sine of θ, sinθ, would increase from 0 up to θ=90°, where sin90° is 1. Wait, no, wait—wait, sin(0) is 0, and sin(90°) is 1. So as θ increases from 0 to 90°, sinθ increases. But wait, for angles beyond 90°, like going towards 180°, sinθ decreases again because sin(180°)=0. So the wave function's magnitude depends on θ.

But wait, the wave function for the 2P_Z orbital is actually proportional to cosθ, right? Because I think the p_z orbital's wave function is proportional to cosθ. Let me think: the general form for p orbitals is proportional to Y_1^m, where m can be -1, 0, +1. For P_Z, m=0, so the associated Legendre polynomial is P_1^0(θ) which is cosθ. So the wave function for 2P_Z would involve cosθ.

So as we move away from the Z axis (increasing θ), cosθ decreases because cos(0) is 1, and cos(90°) is 0. So the wave function's magnitude, |ψ|, would decrease as θ increases. Wait, but the wave function could also have a phase factor, like e^{iφ}, but since the question is about the electron density, which is the square of the absolute value, the phase doesn't matter for density.

So the electron density, which is |ψ|^2, would go as (cosθ)^2. So as θ increases from 0 to 90°, cosθ decreases, so the electron density would decrease. Beyond 90°, cosθ becomes negative, but when squared, it becomes positive again, so the density starts increasing again towards θ=180°, but wait—no, wait. cos(180°) is -1, so (cosθ)^2 is 1 again. So the maximum electron density is along the Z axis (θ=0 and 180°), and it's zero at θ=90°, which is the equatorial plane.

Wait, but the question is about increasing the angle away from the Z axis. So moving from θ=0 to higher θ, what happens to the wave function's magnitude? It decreases until θ=90°, then increases again beyond that. But the question is probably considering angles up to 90°, maybe, because that's where the density is dropping.

So looking at the options, the question is about how the wave function changes when moving away from the Z axis. The wave function itself is proportional to cosθ, so as you move away (θ increases), cosθ decreases, so the wave function's magnitude (absolute value) decreases. But the electron density is the square, so it also decreases until θ=90°, then starts increasing again. But the question is about the general trend as you move away from the Z axis.

Option C says the wave function and the electron density for a 2P_Z electron decreases. That sounds correct because as θ increases, both ψ (cosθ) and |ψ|^2 (cos²θ) decrease up to θ=90°, but beyond that, it changes. But wait, the question is about moving away, so perhaps it's considering θ increasing generally beyond 0, so the electron density would decrease until θ=90°, but after that, it increases again. Hmm, but the options don't specify beyond 90°, just moving away from Z.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the maximum points. The maximum electron density is along the Z axis (θ=0 and 180°), and it's zero at θ=90°. So as you go away from the Z axis (θ increases), the electron density decreases until θ=90°, then increases again. But the question is about moving away, so maybe it's more about moving from θ=0 upwards, so up to θ=90°, the density decreases, but beyond that, it increases. But the options are about the overall effect when moving away.

Wait, but the question is phrased as "how does the wave function... change?" So for the wave function, which is ψ, as θ increases, it's cosθ, which decreases until θ=90°, then becomes negative beyond that. So the magnitude (absolute value) of ψ decreases, but the actual value becomes negative. However, the electron density is |ψ|², which is always positive and depends on cos²θ.

So looking at the options:

A: The wave function increases. No, because |ψ| decreases as θ increases from 0 to 90°, then increases again beyond that.

B: The wave function inverts in phase. That would mean the sign changes, but the question is about the magnitude, not the phase. And the phase change would only affect the wave function, not the electron density. So B might be correct in a way, but I'm not sure if that's what the question is asking about.

C: The wave function and the electron density for a 2P_Z electron decreases. So both decrease as θ increases up to 90°, but beyond that, the electron density increases again. But overall, for angles moving away from Z, up to 90°, yes, both decrease.

D: The wave function becomes constant. No, because ψ depends on θ.

E: No change. That's not true.

F: Electron density spreads uniformly. No, because the density is highest along the Z axis.

G: Electron density becomes more spherically symmetric. Wait, the p orbitals are directional, so the density isn't spherically symmetric. P orbitals have a higher density along one axis and less elsewhere, so making it more symmetric? Not sure.

H: Electron density concentrates on the equatorial plane. Wait, the 2P_Z orbital has zero density at θ=90°, so that's the equatorial plane. So the density is actually lowest there. So H is incorrect.

I: Electron density increases. That's not correct because as θ increases from 0, the density decreases up to 90°, then increases again.

J: The wave function decreases only along the Z axis. No, the wave function changes with θ, not just along Z.

So the correct options would be C, but wait. Let me think again. The wave function is proportional to cosθ. As θ increases, cosθ decreases, so the wave function's magnitude decreases. The electron density, being cos²θ, also decreases as θ increases from 0 to 90°, and then increases again beyond that. So when moving away from the Z axis (θ increases), the electron density first decreases, reaches zero at 90°, then increases again. So overall, for angles up to 90°, both the wave function and electron density decrease.

But the question is about how the wave function and electron density change as the angle increases. So for angles beyond 90°, the electron density increases, but the wave function's magnitude decreases beyond 90° as well? Wait, wait—cosθ is positive for θ <90°, negative for θ between 90° and 180°, and zero at 90° and 270°, etc. But the magnitude of ψ, |ψ|, is |cosθ|, so it's highest at θ=0 and 180°, zero at 90°.

So as θ increases from 0 to 90°, |ψ| decreases, but as θ goes beyond 90° towards 180°, |ψ| increases again. So if the question is about moving away from the Z axis, which is at θ=0, moving towards θ=90° and beyond, the wave function's magnitude first decreases, reaches zero at θ=90°, then increases again towards θ=180°.

But the options don't specify whether it's up to 90° or beyond. The question is a bit ambiguous, but I think it's referring to moving away from the Z axis, which would be increasing θ from 0. So as θ increases, the wave function's magnitude decreases until θ=90°, then increases again. But the electron density (squared) would decrease until θ=90°, then increase again.

So the correct statement would be that the wave function and the electron density decrease as you move away from the Z axis up to θ=90°, but beyond that, the density increases. But the options don't specify that. Option C says both decrease, which is true for θ up to 90°, but not beyond.

Wait, but the question is about how they change when increasing the angle away from the Z axis. So if you move away, the maximum density is at Z (θ=0), and as you move away, the density decreases until θ=90°, then starts increasing again. So the overall trend isn't a straightforward decrease. But the question is a bit ambiguous.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is only considering angles away from the Z axis up to 90°, so in that case, both the wave function and electron density decrease. So the correct answer would be C.

Option I says the electron density increases. That's only true beyond 90°, so not correct in general.

So yes, the correct answer is C: The wave function and the electron density for a 2P_Z electron decreases.
</think>

The wave function for a 2P_Z electron is proportional to \( \cos\theta \), where \( \theta \) is the polar angle measured from the Z axis. As \( \theta \) increases, \( \cos\theta \) decreases in magnitude, meaning the wave function's magnitude decreases. The electron density, which is proportional to \( \cos^2\theta \), also decreases as \( \theta \) increases from 0 to 90°. Beyond 90°, the electron density increases again, but the question focuses on the general trend as the angle increases away from the Z axis. Therefore, the correct answer is that both the wave function and the electron density decrease.
