Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the area between two functions, f(x) = x² - 4x + 10 and g(x) = 4x - x², between x = 1 and x = 3. Hmm, I remember that to find the area between two curves, I need to integrate the top function minus the bottom function over the interval. But first, I should figure out which function is on top and which is on the bottom in the given interval.

Let me start by finding where these two functions intersect. To do that, I'll set f(x) equal to g(x):

x² - 4x + 10 = 4x - x²

Let's move all terms to one side to solve for x:

x² - 4x + 10 - 4x + x² = 0

Combine like terms:

2x² - 8x + 10 = 0

I can simplify this equation by dividing all terms by 2:

x² - 4x + 5 = 0

Wait, let me check if I did that correctly. Let me re-do the step:

f(x) = x² -4x +10
g(x) = -x² +4x

So f(x) - g(x) = (x² -4x +10) - (-x² +4x) = x² -4x +10 +x² -4x = 2x² -8x +10.

So setting 2x² -8x +10 = 0, which simplifies to x² -4x +5 = 0. Hmm, that's a quadratic equation. Let me compute the discriminant to see if there are real roots.

Discriminant D = b² -4ac = (-4)^2 -4*1*5 = 16 -20 = -4. Since D is negative, there are no real roots. That means the functions don't intersect in the real plane, so they don't cross each other between x=1 and x=3. 

Wait, but that can't be right because the functions are both quadratics, and they should intersect somewhere. Did I make a mistake in setting up the equation?

Wait, let me check again. f(x) is x² -4x +10, and g(x) is 4x -x², which can be written as -x² +4x. So f(x) is a parabola opening upwards, and g(x) is a downward-opening parabola.

So when I set them equal:

x² -4x +10 = -x² +4x

Bring all terms to left side:

x² -4x +10 +x² -4x = 0 → 2x² -8x +10 = 0.

Divide by 2: x² -4x +5 =0, same as before. Discriminant is 16 -20 = -4, so no real roots. So they don't intersect, which means one function is always above the other in the interval from x=1 to x=3.

I need to determine which function is on top. Let me plug in a value between 1 and 3, say x=2.

f(2) = (2)^2 -4*(2) +10 = 4 -8 +10 = 6.

g(2) = 4*(2) - (2)^2 = 8 -4 =4.

So at x=2, f(2)=6 and g(2)=4. So f(x) is above g(x) at least at x=2. Let me check another point, like x=1.

f(1) =1 -4 +10=7.

g(1)=4*1 -1=3.

So f(1)=7 and g(1)=3. So f is above g at x=1.

x=3:

f(3)=9-12+10=7.

g(3)=12 -9=3.

Again, f(3)=7 and g(3)=3. So f(x) is above g(x) throughout the interval from 1 to 3. Therefore, the area will be the integral from 1 to 3 of f(x) - g(x) dx.

Compute f(x) - g(x):

f(x) - g(x) = (x² -4x +10) - (4x -x²) = x² -4x +10 -4x +x² = 2x² -8x +10.

So the area is the integral from 1 to 3 of (2x² -8x +10) dx.

Let me compute that integral step by step.

First, find the antiderivative:

Integral of 2x² dx = (2/3)x³.

Integral of -8x dx = -4x².

Integral of 10 dx = 10x.

So the antiderivative F(x) = (2/3)x³ -4x² +10x.

Now evaluate F(x) from 1 to 3.

Compute F(3):

(2/3)*(27) -4*(9) +10*(3) = (2/3)*27 = 18; 18 -36 +30 = 18-36 is -18, plus 30 gives 12.

Compute F(1):

(2/3)*(1) -4*(1) +10*(1) = 2/3 -4 +10 = (2/3) +6 = 6 + 2/3 ≈ 6.6667.

Now subtract F(1) from F(3):

12 - (20/3) = since 6.6667 is 20/3? Wait, no, 6.6667 is 20/3? Wait, 20/3 is approximately 6.6667, yes.

So 12 is 36/3. So 36/3 - 20/3 = 16/3 ≈5.3333.

Wait, but 16/3 is exactly 5.3333... So the area is 16/3, which is approximately 5.333.

Looking at the options, option G is 5.333. So the answer should be G.

The area between f(x) and g(x) from x=1 to x=3 is found by integrating the difference f(x)-g(x) = 2x² -8x +10. The integral evaluates to 16/3, which is approximately 5.333.

Answer: G
