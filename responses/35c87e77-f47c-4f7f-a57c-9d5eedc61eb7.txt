Okay, so I've got this problem here about the translational partition function for gaseous Argon at 298 K confined to a two-dimensional plane. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

First, I remember that the translational partition function is a concept from statistical thermodynamics. It's related to the possible translational states a gas particle can occupy. Since this is a two-dimensional problem, I don't think the three-dimensional formulas will apply directly. Wait, right, in 2D, the partition function would be different.

I think the formula for the translational partition function in two dimensions is q_trans = (A) / (λ_x λ_y), where A is the area and λ_x and λ_y are the de Broglie wavelengths in each direction. But wait, wait—no, maybe it's just q = (2πmkT)^(d/2) * V / h^d, where d is the dimensionality. Oh, right, for 3D, it's (2πmkT)^(3/2) * V / h^3, but here it's 2D, so exponent would be 2/2 =1.

Wait, let me get the exact formula. The general formula for the translational partition function in d dimensions is q = ( (2π m k T) )^(d/2) * (Volume) / h^d. So for d=2, it's (2π m k T)^(1) * A / h^2, since the area A is 2D volume.

Okay, so m is the mass of an Argon atom. Argon's atomic weight is about 39.948 g/mol, but I need to convert that into kg. So 39.948 g/mol is 0.039948 kg/mol. Avogadro's number is 6.022e23 mol^-1, so m = 0.039948 kg/mol / 6.022e23 atoms/mol = approximately 6.63e-26 kg per atom.

Wait, let me calculate that more accurately. 39.948 grams per mole is 0.039948 kg/mol. Divided by Avogadro's number: 0.039948 / 6.022e23 ≈ 6.633e-26 kg per Ar atom.

Next, temperature T is 298 K. Boltzmann's constant k is 1.380649e-23 J/K. Planck's constant h is 6.62607015e-34 J·s.

Putting it all together. The formula for q_trans becomes:

q = (2π m k T) * (A) / h²

Wait, because for d=2, the formula is (2π m k T)^(2/2) * A / h^2, which is same as (2π m k T) * A / h^2.

So let's plug in the numbers.

First, compute 2π m k T.

m = 6.633e-26 kg
k = 1.380649e-23 J/K
T = 298 K

So 2 * π ≈ 6.2832.

Let me compute 2π m k T:

2 * π * m * k * T = 6.2832 * (6.633e-26 kg) * (1.380649e-23 J/K) * 298 K.

Wait, let me compute step by step.

Compute m*k*T first: 6.633e-26 kg * 1.380649e-23 J/K * 298 K.

Let me calculate the numerical values:

m*k*T = 6.633e-26 * 1.380649e-23 * 298.

Let me compute 1.380649e-23 * 298 = approx 4.104e-21.

Then 6.633e-26 * 4.104e-21 = (6.633 *4.104) e-47.

6.633 *4.104 ≈ 27.23, so 27.23e-47 = 2.723e-46.

Now multiply by 2π: 6.2832 * 2.723e-46 ≈ 17.11e-46 = 1.711e-45.

Wait, wait, that can't be right. Let me check the exponents again.

Wait, 6.633e-26 * 1.380649e-23 = (6.633 *1.380649) * 1e-26-23 = 9.190...e-49.

Wait, 1e-26 *1e-23 is 1e-49? Wait no, 1e-26 * 1e-23 is 1e-49? No, wait, 1e-26 * 1e-23 is 1e-49? Because 10^-26 *10^-23 =10^-49. Yes.

So 6.633 *1.380649 ≈ 9.19 (approx). So 9.19e-49.

Then multiply by T=298: 9.19e-49 * 298 ≈ 2.737e-46.

Then multiply by 2π: 6.2832 * 2.737e-46 ≈ 17.13e-46 = 1.713e-45.

So 2π m k T ≈ 1.713e-45 J·s²/kg? Wait, units? Hmm, maybe not necessary for the calculation, but I think the units will work out since we're using them in the partition function.

Now, the area A is 1.00 cm², which is 1e-4 m² (since 1 m² = 1e4 cm², so 1 cm² = 1e-4 m²).

So q_trans = (2π m k T * A) / h².

So now we have 2π m k T = 1.713e-45, A = 1e-4 m².

So numerator is 1.713e-45 * 1e-4 = 1.713e-49.

Denominator is h squared: (6.626e-34)^2.

Compute h squared: (6.626e-34)^2 ≈ (6.626)^2 * 1e-68.

6.626^2 ≈ 43.9, so 43.9e-68 = 4.39e-67.

So q_trans = numerator / denominator = (1.713e-49) / (4.39e-67) = (1.713 /4.39) * 1e( -49 +67 ) = approx 0.390 * 1e18 = 3.90e17.

Wait, let me compute 1.713 /4.39. Let's see, 4.39 * 0.4=1.756, which is a bit higher than 1.713. So 0.39 *4.39≈1.7121. That's close. So 1.713 /4.39≈0.3908.

So 0.3908e18 = 3.908e17.

Looking at the options, option C is 3.9e17, option E is 2.1e17, option D is 5.3e17, etc.

So the closest is option C: 3.9 x10^17.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations to see if I made any mistakes.

Another approach: let me compute 2π m k T * A = 2π * m * k * T * A.

Wait, maybe I should compute each step more accurately.

Compute m = 39.948 g/mol / 1000 = 0.039948 kg/mol.

m per atom = 0.039948 kg/mol / 6.022e23 atoms/mol = 0.039948 /6.022e23 ≈ 6.63e-26 kg.

k=1.380649e-23 J/K.

T=298 K.

A=1 cm²=1e-4 m².

h=6.626e-34 J·s.

Compute 2π m k T A / h².

Let me compute each part:

2π = 6.2832.

m=6.63e-26 kg.

k=1.38e-23 J/K.

T=298 K.

A=1e-4 m².

h^2 = (6.626e-34)^2 = approx 4.39e-67 J²·s².

So compute numerator: 2π * m *k * T * A.

2π * m =6.2832 *6.63e-26 ≈41.77e-26 =4.177e-25.

Then multiply by k:4.177e-25 *1.38e-23 ≈5.77e-48.

Multiply by T=298:5.77e-48 *298≈1.715e-45.

Multiply by A=1e-4 m²: 1.715e-45 *1e-4 =1.715e-49.

So numerator is 1.715e-49.

Denominator h²=4.39e-67.

So q = (1.715e-49) / (4.39e-67) = (1.715/4.39) * 1e18.

1.715 /4.39 ≈0.3906.

So q≈0.3906e18 =3.906e17.

So that's about 3.9e17, which matches option C: 3.9 x10^17.

Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the formula. Let me think again about the formula for the translational partition function in 2D.

The general formula in d dimensions is q = ( (2π m k T) )^{d/2} * V / h^d.

So for d=2, it's (2π m k T)^(1) * A / h².

Which is what I used. So that's correct.

Wait, another way to compute it: compute the thermal wavelength λ, and then A/(λ_x λ_y). But in 2D, the thermal wavelength would be sqrt( (h^2)/(2π m k T) ), so λ = h / sqrt(2π m k T).

Wait, no, the expression for the de Broglie wavelength is λ = h / sqrt(2π m k T), but I think I might have the formula wrong. Let me check: the thermal wavelength is λ = h / sqrt(2π m k T).

Wait, for 3D, the partition function is (V) / (λ_x λ_y λ_z) ) = V/(λ^3), where λ is the thermal wavelength.

In 2D, it would be A/(λ_x λ_y) = A/λ², since λ_x=λ_y=λ in 2D.

So λ = h / sqrt(2π m k T).

So q = A/(λ²) = A * (2π m k T) / h².

Which is the same as the formula I used earlier. So yes, that's correct.

So I think the calculation is correct, leading to option C.

To calculate the translational partition function for gaseous Argon confined to a two-dimensional plane, we use the formula:

\[
q_{\text{trans}} = \frac{(2\pi m k T) \cdot A}{h^2}
\]

### Step 1: Gather constants and values
- **Mass of Argon (m):**  
  Argon's atomic weight is \(39.948 \, \text{g/mol}\), which converts to \(0.039948 \, \text{kg/mol}\). Dividing by Avogadro's number (\(6.022 \times 10^{23} \, \text{mol}^{-1}\)) gives:  
  \[
  m = \frac{0.039948}{6.022 \times 10^{23}} \approx 6.63 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{kg}.
  \]

- **Boltzmann's constant (\(k\)):** \(1.380649 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K}\).  
- **Temperature (\(T\)):** \(298 \, \text{K}\).  
- **Area (\(A\)):** \(1.00 \, \text{cm}^2 = 1.00 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{m}^2\).  
- **Planck's constant (\(h\)):** \(6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}\).

### Step 2: Compute \(2\pi m k T\)
\[
2\pi m k T = 2 \cdot \pi \cdot (6.63 \times 10^{-26}) \cdot (1.38 \times 10^{-23}) \cdot 298.
\]

- First, calculate \(m k T\):  
  \[
  m k T = (6.63 \times 10^{-26}) \cdot (1.38 \times 10^{-23}) \cdot 298 \approx 2.723 \times 10^{-46}.
  \]

- Multiply by \(2\pi\):  
  \[
  2\pi m k T \approx 1.713 \times 10^{-45}.
  \]

### Step 3: Compute \(h^2\)
\[
h^2 = (6.626 \times 10^{-34})^2 \approx 4.39 \times 10^{-67}.
\]

### Step 4: Compute the partition function
\[
q_{\text{trans}} = \frac{(2\pi m k T) \cdot A}{h^2} = \frac{(1.713 \times 10^{-45}) \cdot (1.00 \times 10^{-4})}{4.39 \times 10^{-67}}.
\]

- Numerator:  
  \[
  (1.713 \times 10^{-45}) \cdot (1.00 \times 10^{-4}) = 1.713 \times 10^{-49}.
  \]

- Denominator:  
  \[
  4.39 \times 10^{-67}.
  \]

- Final calculation:  
  \[
  q_{\text{trans}} = \frac{1.713 \times 10^{-49}}{4.39 \times 10^{-67}} \approx 3.906 \times 10^{17}.
  \]

### Step 5: Match with options
The closest option is **C: \(3.9 \times 10^{17}\)**.
