Okay, so I have this question about ethical guidelines regarding someone administering psychological tests. Let me try to break it down.

The question is about Alice A., who has a master's degree in clinical psychology but isn't licensed. She's been hired by a community mental health clinic to do several things, including administering standard psychological tests to adult clients. The question is asking whether this is acceptable under ethical guidelines, and there are several options to choose from.

First, I need to recall what the ethical guidelines say about who can administer psychological tests. I know that in psychology, there's a distinction between what a licensed psychologist can do versus someone without a license. Typically, administering psychological tests, especially standardized ones, usually requires some level of licensure or at least being under the supervision of a licensed professional.

Alice has a master's degree, which is a step towards a doctorate, but she's not licensed. So, can she administer these tests on her own? I think the answer might depend on whether she's supervised or not. Some guidelines allow master's-level professionals to administer tests if they're under the supervision of a licensed psychologist.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Acceptable if a professional clinical psychologist co-signs her evaluations. That seems possible, but I'm not sure if co-signing is enough. Or does she need more direct supervision?

Option B: Unacceptable because she doesn't have a doctoral degree. That's a possibility because some places require a PhD for administering tests, but I'm not sure if that's a hard and fast rule everywhere.

Option C: Acceptable if a professional counselor supervises her. Wait, but the question is about a clinical psychologist, not a counselor. Maybe the supervisor needs to be a psychologist, not just any counselor.

Option D: Unacceptable because she's not licensed. That sounds likely because many places require a license to administer tests, even if she's supervised. Or does supervision override the lack of licensure?

Option E: Acceptable if a professional clinical psychologist supervises her. This seems plausible because many states allow master's-level individuals to do testing under supervision.

Option F: Unacceptable because she doesn't have a PhD. Similar to B, but again, maybe it's about being a licensed psychologist rather than just having a PhD.

Option G: Acceptable if she's pursuing licensure. That might be a factor, but I don't think it's sufficient on its own unless other conditions are met.

Option H: Unacceptable because she lacks a specialization in testing. I don't think that's the main issue here; the issue is more about licensure and supervision.

Option I: Acceptable if the clinic has liability insurance. That doesn't seem directly related to her qualifications, more about the clinic's responsibility.

Option J: Acceptable if she gets more training and certification. That could be a factor, but the question is about current acceptability based on her current status.

So, putting this together: Alice has a master's but isn't licensed. The key seems to be whether she can administer tests under supervision. Option E says it's acceptable if a professional clinical psychologist supervises her. Option A is about co-signing, which might be less than active supervision.

I think the correct answer is E because ethical guidelines often allow non-licensed master's-level individuals to administer tests when supervised by a licensed psychologist. Co-signing (Option A) might not be enough; active supervision is probably required.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Some places might require the psychologist to be present or actively overseeing the work, not just co-signing. So E is better because it's about supervision, not just a signature.

The correct answer is E: acceptable as long as a professional clinical psychologist supervises Alice’s activities. Ethical guidelines typically allow individuals with a master's degree to administer psychological tests if they are supervised by a licensed clinical psychologist. Co-signing (Option A) may not be sufficient, as active supervision is generally required. Other options either focus on incorrect qualifications or unrelated factors, making E the most appropriate choice.

Answer: E
