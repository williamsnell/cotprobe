Question:

Which of the following is true about the diagnosis of "osteopenia" or "osteoporosis" in North America and Western Europe


Options:

A: Women over age 80 with osteopenia have above average bone mineral density for their age
B: Fewer than 10% of women over age 50 have osteopenia
C: Fewer than 50% of women over age 80 have osteopenia or osteoporosis
D: Osteoporosis is defined as a bone density lower than 2.5 standard deviations below the average for age-matched controls.

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about osteopenia and osteoporosis, and I need to figure out which statement is true. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, I remember that osteopenia is a condition where bone mineral density (BMD) is lower than normal but not as severe as osteoporosis. Osteoporosis is when the BMD is significantly lower, making bones more fragile and prone to fractures.

The question is asking which of the options A through D is true about the diagnosis in North America and Western Europe. Let's look at each option one by one.

Option A: Women over age 80 with osteopenia have above average bone mineral density for their age. Hmm, that doesn't sound right. If someone has osteopenia, their BMD is below average. So this can't be correct because they wouldn't have above average density if they have osteopenia.

Option B: Fewer than 10% of women over age 50 have osteopenia. I'm not sure about this one. I remember hearing that a significant number of older women have some form of bone density issues. I think it's more than 10%, so this might be false.

Option C: Fewer than 50% of women over age 80 have osteopenia or osteoporosis. Again, I'm not certain, but I recall that the prevalence increases with age. So by age 80, I think a lot of women, more than half, might have either condition. This could be incorrect.

Option D: Osteoporosis is defined as a bone density lower than 2.5 standard deviations below the average for age-matched controls. I'm pretty sure this is correct. The World Health Organization defines osteoporosis as a BMD that's 2.5 standard deviations below the mean of a healthy young adult of the same sex. So this seems accurate.

Let me double-check each option. For option A, if someone has osteopenia, their BMD is below normal, so they can't have above average. So A is wrong.

Option B says fewer than 10% over 50 have osteopenia. From what I know, around 50% of women over 50 have low bone density, including both osteopenia and osteoporosis. So B is probably false.

Option C claims fewer than 50% of women over 80 have either condition. That doesn't sound right. I think the prevalence is much higher, maybe around 70% or more. So C is incorrect.

So the only correct statement seems to be option D, which correctly defines osteoporosis in terms of standard deviations below the mean.

The correct answer is D, as it accurately defines osteoporosis based on bone mineral density criteria.

Answer: D
