Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question here, and I need to figure out which answer is correct. Let's take it step by step.

The question presents two statements and asks which are true or false. I need to evaluate each statement separately to determine their validity.

Statement (1): In every country, people think other individuals in their country are less happy than they actually are. Hmm, I'm not entirely sure about this. I remember reading something about how people often compare themselves to others, but does that mean they think others are less happy? Maybe this relates to the idea of the "happy neighbor syndrome," where people believe their neighbors are happier than they are. But does this happen in every country? I'm not certain, but I think there's some research suggesting that people tend to overestimate others' happiness, thinking others are happier than they truly are. So maybe statement (1) is true.

Statement (2): In the United States, women’s happiness has increased both absolutely and relative to men. I'm more familiar with this one. I've heard that over the past few decades, women's happiness levels have gone up. Some studies show that American women have become happier compared to men, which might be due to various factors like increased educational and career opportunities. So statement (2) seems to be true as well.

Wait, but I should double-check. For statement (1), does it hold true universally across every country? I might be conflating general trends with specific findings. There might be countries where people accurately perceive others' happiness or even think others are happier than they are. But the statement says "in every country," which is a strong claim. I'm not sure if it's true for every single country. Maybe in some cultures, people don't have such biases. Alternatively, perhaps the statement is a general trend, not an absolute in every country. So maybe statement (1) is not entirely true everywhere. Or perhaps the original research suggests that this is a widespread phenomenon, making statement (1) true.

Wait, I think the first statement is referring to a phenomenon known as the "false uniqueness effect," where people think their own negative emotions are unique, but maybe it's more about happiness. Alternatively, the "happy neighbor syndrome" is a specific example where people think their neighbors are happier than they are. If that's the case, then statement (1) might not be true in every country, but perhaps in many. But the statement says "in every country," which might make it false because there could be exceptions.

Wait, no, the statement is phrased as "In every country," which implies that this is universally true. But I'm not sure if that's the case. Maybe in some countries, people accurately perceive others' happiness, or perhaps they think others are less happy. Without specific data, it's hard to say. But I think the general consensus in social psychology is that people tend to overestimate others' happiness. So perhaps statement (1) is true.

So if both statements are true, the answer would be C: True, True. But wait, I remember something about statement (2) being a bit more nuanced. Let me think again. Has women's happiness increased absolutely and relative to men in the US? I think the data shows that women's happiness has increased, but relative to men, the gap might not have widened as much, or perhaps it's more that both genders have become happier but women more so. Or maybe in recent years, the trend has changed. I'm a bit fuzzy on the details, but I think the general trend is that women have become happier compared to men. So statement (2) is true.

Wait, no, I think I might be confusing this with the idea that women have experienced more progress in areas like education and workforce participation, which could contribute to higher happiness. So statement (2) is true. Therefore, both statements are true, making the answer C. But wait, the options are A: Both are largely true, which might be different from C. Let me check the options again.

Looking back, option C is "True, True," while option A is "Both statements are largely true." So if both are true, then C is the correct choice. Alternatively, if one is only partially true, that might affect the answer.

Wait, perhaps statement (1) isn't entirely true. Maybe it's true in some countries but not all. So if the first statement is not true in every country, then it's false as a universal statement. That would make statement (1) false. If that's the case, then statement (2) is true, which would make the answer E: True, False. But wait, no, because statement (1) being false would mean the first part is false, and statement (2) is true, so the answer would be E: True, False? Wait, no. The options are in terms of statement 1 and statement 2.

Wait, let me clarify: the options are about the two statements. So if statement (1) is true and statement (2) is true, the answer is C. If statement (1) is false and statement (2) is true, the answer would be E: True, False? Wait, no. Let me look at the options again.

Options:

A: Both statements are largely true

B: False, False

C: True, True

D: The first statement is true, the second statement is largely false

E: True, False

F: The first statement is false, the second statement is partially true

G: False, True

H: The first statement is partially true, the second statement is false

I: The first statement is largely false, the second statement is true

J: Both statements are partially true

Wait, so if statement (1) is true and statement (2) is true, then C is correct. But if statement (1) is not true in every country, then it's false as a universal statement. So let's reevaluate statement (1). The statement says "In every country, people think other individuals in their country are less happy than they actually are." If this is not the case in every country, then statement (1) is false. So perhaps in some countries, people accurately perceive others' happiness or even think others are happier. But does this hold true for every country? I'm not sure. Maybe the statement is an overgeneralization.

If statement (1) is false because it's not true in every country, and statement (2) is true, then the correct answer would be I: The first statement is largely false, the second statement is true.

Alternatively, if statement (1) is true for most countries but not all, then it's "largely true," making A the answer. But the wording is "in every country," which requires it to be true universally. So if it's not universally true, then statement (1) is false.

So putting it together:

Statement (1): False (because it's not true in every country)

Statement (2): True

Therefore, the answer would be I: The first statement is largely false, the second statement is true.

Wait, but the options are about the truth of each statement. So if statement (1) is false and statement (2) is true, the correct option would be G: False, True. Because the first statement is false, the second is true.

Wait, no. Let me check the options again. Option G is "False, True." So if statement (1) is false and statement (2) is true, then G is correct.

But earlier I thought statement (1) might be true. So I'm a bit confused. Let me try to find some sources.

Upon checking, I recall that there's a concept called "misery loves company," where people assume others are happier than they are. Studies have shown that people tend to believe that their neighbors or others are happier, which can lead to social comparisons and lower self-esteem. This is known in some contexts, like the "happy neighbor syndrome." However, whether this is true in every country is another question. It might be a general trend, but not necessarily universal across all cultures and countries.

If the statement says "in every country," and if there's even one country where people accurately perceive others' happiness or think they're more happy, then the statement is not universally true. But I think the general consensus is that people do tend to think others are happier, so statement (1) is true. However, I'm not entirely certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the first statement is false because it's not the case in every country. So if statement (1) is false and statement (2) is true, then the answer is G: False, True.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about statement (2). Women's happiness in the US. I believe that over the past few decades, women's life satisfaction has increased, and they are now happier than men in some measures. So statement (2) is likely true.

If statement (1) is true, then the answer is C. If statement (1) is false, then G is correct.

Wait, I think I remember a study that found that people in many countries believe others are happier than they are, but not all. So statement (1) is not true in every country, making it false as a universal statement. Therefore, statement (1) is false, and statement (2) is true, so the answer is G: False, True.

Wait, no. Because the options are about the statements as given. Let me recheck:

If statement (1) is false (because it's not true in every country), and statement (2) is true, then the answer is G: False, True.

Alternatively, if both are true, then C is correct.

I'm going to go with I: The first statement is largely false, the second statement is true. Because I think the first statement is an overgeneralization and not true for every country.

The question evaluates the truthfulness of two statements about happiness perception and trends in the United States. 

**Statement (1):** It claims that in every country, people think others are less happy than they actually are. While there is evidence suggesting people often overestimate others' happiness (e.g., "happy neighbor syndrome"), the statement's universality across every country is questionable. Since it is not true for every country, the statement is largely false.

**Statement (2):** It states that in the United States, women's happiness has increased both absolutely and relative to men. Research supports this, as women have seen rises in happiness, likely due to gains in education and workforce participation. Thus, this statement is true.

Given these evaluations, the first statement is largely false, and the second is true. 

**Answer: I**
