Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about water flowing over a waterfall and figuring out the maximum temperature difference and the usable power going to waste. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.

First, the problem says that water flows at a rate of 2.5 m³/s over a waterfall that's 15 meters high. The density of water is given as 10³ kg/m³, and the specific heat capacity is 10³ cal/(kg·°C). Wait, that specific heat is in calories, but usually in physics, we use joules. Oh wait, maybe I can work with calories here, but I should check the units later.

The question has two parts: the maximum temperature difference between the water at the top and bottom, and the usable power that's going to waste. So, I think this is about energy conversion. When water falls, its gravitational potential energy is converted into kinetic energy, and some of that might go into heat, hence the temperature rise.

Let me think about the energy involved. The potential energy (PE) of the water is mgh, where m is mass, g is acceleration due to gravity, and h is the height. The kinetic energy (KE) at the bottom would be similar, but since it's falling, the KE would equal the PE lost. But not all of that KE is usable as power; some is lost as heat, which increases the water's temperature.

Wait, but the problem says 'usable power going to waste.' Oh, so maybe the water's kinetic energy is what could be used, but some of it is lost as heat. Alternatively, perhaps the power available is the kinetic energy, and the heat is the power lost. Hmm, I might need to clarify that.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the maximum possible temperature difference, which would occur when all the potential energy is converted into heat. But that sounds a bit off because in reality, not all energy goes into heat. Wait, but the question says 'maximum difference', which implies assuming that all the energy is converted into heat. So maybe that's the approach.

So, let's proceed. The mass flow rate is given as 2.5 m³/s. The density is 10³ kg/m³, so the mass per second (m_dot) is density * volume flow rate. So m_dot = 10³ kg/m³ * 2.5 m³/s = 2500 kg/s.

The potential energy per unit time (power) is m_dot * g * h. So that's 2500 kg/s * 9.81 m/s² * 15 m. Let me calculate that.

2500 * 9.81 = 24525, and 24525 *15 = 367875 Watts. So approximately 367,875 W, which is 367.875 kW. That would be the potential energy per second, or the power.

If all this energy were converted into heat, the temperature rise would be calculated using the formula Q = mcΔT. Here, Q is the energy (in joules), m is mass, c is specific heat, and ΔT is the temperature change. But wait, the specific heat given is in calories. I know that 1 calorie is approximately 4.184 joules. So maybe I should convert everything to joules.

Wait, but perhaps I can work in calories. Let me see: the specific heat capacity is 10³ cal/(kg·°C). So for the mass flow rate, each second, 2500 kg of water is moving. The energy per second (power) is 367,875 J/s (since 1 W = 1 J/s). But if this energy is converted into heat, then:

Power = m_dot * c * ΔT, where ΔT is in °C. So rearranging, ΔT = Power / (m_dot * c). But wait, here Power is in J/s, and c is in cal/(kg·°C). I need to make sure the units match. So let's convert Power into cal/s.

Since 1 J = 0.239 cal (because 1 cal = 4.184 J), so 367875 J/s is 367875 * 0.239 cal/s. Let me calculate that: 367875 * 0.239 ≈ let's see. 367875 * 0.2 is 73,575, and 0.039 is about 14,345.25, so total around 87,920.25 cal/s.

So Power in cal/s is approximately 87,920.25 cal/s.

Now, m_dot is 2500 kg/s, and c is 10³ cal/(kg·°C). So ΔT = Power / (m_dot * c) = 87920.25 / (2500 * 1000) = 87920.25 / 2,500,000. Let me compute that: 87920.25 / 2,500,000 = approximately 0.035168 °C. So about 0.035°C.

Wait, but let me check my calculations again. Maybe I made a mistake in unit conversion.

Wait, another approach: Calculate energy per second in joules, then convert to calories.

Energy per second (power) is m_dot * g * h = 2500 kg/s * 9.81 m/s² * 15 m = 2500 * 9.81 *15 = 2500 * 147.15 = 367,875 W or 367,875 J/s.

Now, the specific heat in cal/(kg·°C) is 10³, so c = 1000 cal/(kg·°C). To use in the equation Q = mcΔT, I need to have Q in calories. Since 1 J = 0.239 cal, then 367875 J/s = 367875 * 0.239 cal/s ≈ 87,935 cal/s.

So the rate of heat transfer (power in cal/s) is 87,935 cal/s.

Now, the mass flow rate is 2500 kg/s. So the temperature rise ΔT is (Power in cal/s) / (mass flow rate * specific heat) = 87935 / (2500 * 1000) = 87935 / 2,500,000 = approx 0.035172 °C, which is roughly 0.035°C.

Looking at the options, option F is 0.035°C and 367.5 kW. Wait, but the power I calculated was approximately 367.875 kW, which is about 367.9 kW. The option F says 367.5 kW, which is very close. So the temperature rise is about 0.035°C, and the power is about 367.5 kW.

Wait, but I'm supposed to find the maximum temperature difference, which would be under the assumption that all the potential energy is converted into heat. So that makes sense. Therefore, the maximum temperature difference is 0.035°C.

But wait, another thought: the problem says 'usable power going to waste.' So perhaps the usable power is the potential energy converted into work, but in reality, some of it is lost as heat. Wait, but the way the question is phrased, maybe the usable power is the potential energy, and the heat is the waste. So the usable power would be m_dot * g * h, which is 367.875 kW, which is about 367.9 kW. So the option F says 367.5 kW, which is very close. The temperature is 0.035°C.

So option F would be the correct choice: 0.035°C and 367.5 kW.

Wait, but I'm seeing option F: 0.035°C and 367.5 kW. That matches my calculations. So I think the answer is F.

The problem involves calculating the maximum temperature difference and the usable power going to waste when water flows over a waterfall. The water flows at a rate of 2.5 m³/s, with a height of 15 m. The density of water is 10³ kg/m³, and its specific heat capacity is 10³ cal/(kg·°C).

First, the mass flow rate is calculated as:

\[
\dot{m} = \text{density} \times \text{volume flow rate} = 10^3 \, \text{kg/m}^3 \times 2.5 \, \text{m}^3/\text{s} = 2500 \, \text{kg/s}.
\]

The potential energy per unit time (power) is:

\[
P = \dot{m} \times g \times h = 2500 \, \text{kg/s} \times 9.81 \, \text{m/s}^2 \times 15 \, \text{m} = 367,875 \, \text{W} \, (\text{or } 367.875 \, \text{kW}).
\]

Assuming all this energy is converted into heat, the temperature rise is calculated using:

\[
\Delta T = \frac{P}{\dot{m} \times c},
\]

where \( c = 10^3 \, \text{cal/(kg·°C)} \). Converting \( P \) to calories per second:

\[
P = 367,875 \, \text{J/s} \times 0.239 \, \text{cal/J} \approx 87,920.25 \, \text{cal/s}.
\]

Thus:

\[
\Delta T = \frac{87,920.25}{2500 \times 1000} = 0.035168 \, \text{°C} \approx 0.035 \, \text{°C}.
\]

The usable power going to waste is approximately \( 367.875 \, \text{kW} \), which rounds to \( 367.5 \, \text{kW} \). Comparing with the options, the correct answer is:

**F: 0.035°C and 367.5 kW.**
