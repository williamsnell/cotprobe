Okay, so I need to figure out the selling price for Joe's Department Store's coat. The problem says they want a 20% margin on the selling price, and the cost is $40. Hmm, let me break this down.

First, I remember that a margin is usually calculated based on the selling price. So, the margin is the percentage of the selling price that is profit. That means the selling price (SP) minus the cost (which is $40) should equal 20% of the SP. 

Let me write that out as an equation. If the margin is 20%, then:

SP - Cost = 0.20 * SP

Wait, that makes sense because the cost is the part that's not the margin. So, substituting the cost:

SP - 40 = 0.20 * SP

I can rearrange this equation to solve for SP. Let me subtract 0.20 SP from both sides:

SP - 0.20 SP = 40

Which simplifies to:

0.80 SP = 40

Now, to find SP, I divide both sides by 0.80:

SP = 40 / 0.80

Hmm, what's 40 divided by 0.8? Let me think. 0.8 goes into 40 fifty times because 0.8 times 50 is 40. So, SP = $50.

Wait, but let me double-check. If the selling price is $50, then 20% of that is $10. So, the cost is $40, and $50 minus $40 is $10, which is indeed 20% of $50. That seems right.

Looking at the options, H is $50. So the answer should be H.

The selling price is calculated by dividing the cost by (1 - margin), which gives $50. 

Answer: H
