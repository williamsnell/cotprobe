Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Alright, let's see what the question says.

There's a horizontal spring attached to a wall on one end. The other end has a mass of 0.30 kg attached to it. The mass is resting on a table. Then, the mass is displaced 0.030 meters from its equilibrium position and released. As it passes through the equilibrium point, it's moving at 0.040 m/s. We're told there's no friction, and we need to find the total mechanical energy of the system.

Hmm, mechanical energy... that's the sum of kinetic and potential energy. Since there's no friction, the energy should be conserved, right? So when the mass is at the equilibrium position, all the energy is kinetic because the potential energy in the spring is zero there. And when it's at maximum displacement, all the energy is potential, with kinetic being zero. But wait, the question is asking for the total mechanical energy of the system, which is the same as the maximum potential energy or the maximum kinetic energy, I think.

Wait, no, because the total mechanical energy is the sum when both kinetic and potential are present. But in this case, when the mass is at the equilibrium, the kinetic energy is maximum and potential is zero. So the total energy E would be equal to the kinetic energy at that point.

Wait, but kinetic energy is (1/2)mv². Let me compute that. m is 0.30 kg, v is 0.040 m/s. So KE = 0.5 * 0.30 * (0.040)^2. Let me calculate that.

0.5 * 0.3 is 0.15. 0.04 squared is 0.0016. So 0.15 * 0.0016 = 0.00024. Wait, but that gives me 0.00024 J, which is 0.24 mJ. Wait, because 1 mJ is 1e-3 J, so 0.00024 J equals 0.24 mJ. So that would be option C.

Wait, but wait a second. Alternatively, maybe I should check using the potential energy at maximum displacement. Because when the mass is at maximum displacement, all the energy is potential. So the potential energy is (1/2)kx², where x is 0.030 m.

But I don't know k, the spring constant. Hmm, but perhaps I can find k using the given information. Because when the mass passes through equilibrium, it has maximum speed, which is given as 0.040 m/s. So at that point, the kinetic energy is maximum, and the potential is zero. But wait, we can also find the maximum potential energy from the maximum displacement and set that equal to the kinetic energy at equilibrium, since energy is conserved.

Wait, let's think again. The total mechanical energy E is conserved, so E = KE at equilibrium = (1/2)mv² = 0.5 * 0.30 * (0.04)^2 = 0.5 * 0.30 * 0.0016. Let me compute that again.

0.5 * 0.30 is 0.15. Multiply by 0.0016: 0.15 * 0.0016 = 0.00024 J, which is 0.24 mJ. So option C.

Alternatively, when the mass is at maximum displacement, x = 0.030 m, the potential energy is (1/2)kx², and the kinetic energy is zero. So the total energy E is equal to (1/2)k(0.03)^2.

But how can I find k? Well, maybe using the velocity at equilibrium. Because when the mass is at equilibrium, the kinetic energy is (1/2)mv², which is E. So E = (1/2)mv². So with m=0.30 kg, v=0.040 m/s, E = 0.5 *0.30 *0.04^2 = as before, 0.24 mJ.

So I think the correct answer is C, which is 0.24 mJ.
</think>

To determine the total mechanical energy of the system, we note that it is conserved due to the absence of friction. At the equilibrium position, the mass has maximum kinetic energy and zero potential energy. The kinetic energy is given by:

\[
KE = \frac{1}{2}mv^2
\]

Substituting the values \( m = 0.30 \, \text{kg} \) and \( v = 0.040 \, \text{m/s} \):

\[
KE = 0.5 \times 0.30 \times (0.040)^2 = 0.5 \times 0.30 \times 0.0016 = 0.00024 \, \text{J}
\]

Converting to millijoules (\( 1 \, \text{mJ} = 10^{-3} \, \text{J} \)):

\[
KE = 0.24 \, \text{mJ}
\]

Thus, the total mechanical energy of the system is \( 0.24 \, \text{mJ} \).
