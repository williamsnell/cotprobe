Alright, so I've got this multiple-choice question about ethics, specifically about the concept of a "prima facie duty." I'm a bit rusty on my philosophy terms, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

First, I need to understand what a prima facie duty is. From what I remember, the term "prima facie" comes from Latin, meaning "at first glance" or "on the face of it." So, a prima facie duty would be something that appears to be a duty upon first inspection, but maybe not in every situation.

Looking at the options:

A: Seems to be right, although this might be illusory.
B: Tends to be right, although this might be outweighed by other considerations.
C: Is right.
D: Is the first thing that an agent ought to do, above all else.

I think the key here is that a prima facie duty is not necessarily absolute. It's not always the case that the duty is right in all circumstances. Instead, it's a duty that appears to be right under initial consideration but might not hold when other factors are taken into account.

Option A says it seems right but might be illusory. That sounds plausible because it's about the initial appearance. But I'm not sure if "illusory" is the right term here. Maybe it's more about being overridden by other duties.

Option B says it tends to be right but might be outweighed. This also rings a bell because I remember that prima facie duties can be overridden by stronger duties. So, even if an act tends to be right, other considerations could make it wrong.

Option C is too absolute. If a duty is right, it's not just prima facie; it's a categorical imperative, maybe Kantian in nature. So C doesn't seem right because prima facie is more about apparent duties that can be set aside.

Option D talks about being the first thing to do, above all else. That sounds more like a prima ordine or something else, not exactly the same as prima facie. Prima facie is about initial appearance, not necessarily the priority.

So between A and B. Let me think again. Prima facie duties are those that, upon first glance, seem to be duties, but they can be overridden. So if a duty tends to be right but might be outweighed, that fits B. Because it's about the tendency but not absolute.

Wait, but does the question say "in virtue of which the act is" something? The question is asking what the characteristic is. So a prima facie duty is a characteristic that makes the act seem right, but this might not hold when considering other duties.

So A says "seems right, although illusory." But I think the point is that it's not necessarily illusory, but it's a prima facie (apparent) rightness that could be overridden. So B is more about the tendency and the possibility of being outweighed.

Wait, the question is about the characteristic of the act. So if the act has a prima facie duty, it tends to be right, but other factors could make it wrong. So option B seems to fit better.

The concept of a "prima facie duty" refers to an act that appears to be right upon initial consideration but may not hold when other factors are taken into account. It is not absolute but rather a duty that can be overridden by stronger considerations. 

- **Option A** suggests the act seems right but might be illusory. While this captures the initial appearance, "illusory" implies a lack of reality, which is not the precise focus of prima facie duties.
- **Option B** states the act tends to be right but might be outweighed by other considerations. This aligns well with the idea that a prima facie duty is a duty that appears right but can be overridden by stronger duties.
- **Option C** is too absolute, as it implies the act is always right, which contradicts the nature of prima facie duties.
- **Option D** suggests the act is the first and most important, which does not capture the conditional nature of prima facie duties.

Thus, the best answer is **B**, as it accurately reflects the tendency of the act to be right while acknowledging the possibility of being outweighed by other considerations.

Answer: B
