Okay, so I have this question about ratios, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.

The question says that the weekly milk order for the Tranquility Inn includes 40 gallons of low-fat milk and 15 gallons of chocolate milk. I need to find the ratio of low-fat gallons to chocolate gallons. The options are from A to J, each a different ratio.

Alright, so the first thing I remember is that a ratio compares two quantities. Here, it's low-fat to chocolate. So, the numbers I have are 40 and 15. I think I should write this as 40:15. But wait, ratios are usually simplified to their lowest terms, right? So I need to reduce this fraction.

Let me think about how to simplify 40/15. Both numbers are divisible by 5. If I divide both by 5, 40 ÷ 5 is 8, and 15 ÷ 5 is 3. So the simplified ratio would be 8:3.

Now, looking at the options, I need to find which one has 8:3. Let me go through each option:

A: 5:03. Hmm, that's 5:3, which is different from 8:3.

B:8:04. Wait, 04 is 4. So that's 8:4, which simplifies to 2:1. Not what I need.

C:8:05. That's 8:5. No, I'm looking for 8:3.

D:2:01. That's 2:1, which is not it.

E:3:01. 3:1, nope.

F:8:03. Oh, that's 8:3. Perfect, that's what I got.

G:7:03. 7:3, not the same.

H:6:03. 6:3 is 2:1, same as B.

I:4:01. 4:1, no.

J:5:01. 5:1, no.

So the correct answer must be F:8:03.

The ratio of low-fat to chocolate milk is 40:15, which simplifies to 8:3. The correct option is F.

Answer: F
