Okay, so I need to figure out the cost per tire for Good-day Tire Company. Let's see, the problem says they had expenses of $820,600 over the past 6 months and produced 110,000 tires. I think the cost per tire is just the total expenses divided by the number of tires produced, right?

So, the formula should be Cost per tire = Total Expenses / Number of Tires. That makes sense because it's like spreading the total cost evenly across each tire.

Let me plug in the numbers. The total expenses are $820,600, and the number of tires is 110,000. So, I need to divide 820,600 by 110,000. Let me do that calculation.

Hmm, 820,600 divided by 110,000. I can simplify this by dividing both numerator and denominator by 1,000 to make it easier. That gives me 820.6 divided by 110. Now, I can do this division step by step.

Let me think, 110 times 7 is 770. That's less than 820.6. 110 times 7.4 is 110 *7 =770 plus 110*.4=44, so 770+44=814. Still less than 820.6. Next, 110*7.5 is 825, which is more than 820.6. So somewhere between 7.4 and 7.5.

Wait, but maybe I should just do the exact division. Let me compute 820600 รท 110000. Alternatively, I can simplify the fraction: 820600 / 110000. Both numbers can be divided by 100, so that becomes 8206 / 1100.

Hmm, 1100 goes into 8206 how many times? Let's see:

1100 *7 = 7700. Subtract that from 8206: 8206 -7700=506.

So that's 7 with a remainder of 506. Now, 506 divided by 1100 is 0.46. So altogether, it's 7.46.

Wait, so the cost per tire is $7.46. Looking at the options, J is $7.46. So the answer should be J.

Let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a calculation mistake. Maybe I can use another method. 110,000 tires at $7.46 each would be 110,000 *7.46.

Calculating that: 110,000 *7 = 770,000. 110,000 *0.46 = 50,600. So total is 770,000 +50,600=820,600. Yep, that matches the total expenses. So yes, J is correct.

The cost per tire is calculated by dividing the total expenses by the number of tires produced. This results in $7.46 per tire, which corresponds to option J.

Answer: J
