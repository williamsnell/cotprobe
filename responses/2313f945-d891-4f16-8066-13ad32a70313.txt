Alright, let's tackle this logic problem step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow and try to understand each part carefully.

First, the problem presents an argument and asks whether it's valid using indirect truth tables. If it's invalid, I need to choose a counterexample from the given options. Let's break down what each part means and then construct the truth table.

The argument given is:
H ≡ (I · ~J)  -- So H is equivalent to (I and not J)
K ≡ ~H        -- K is equivalent to not H
~(K ⊃ J)      -- The negation of (K implies J)
We need to see if this leads to I ≡ J (I is equivalent to J).

Wait, no, the conclusion is I ≡ J. But the argument is supposed to derive that from the premises. Hmm.

So, to use indirect truth tables, I think I need to assume the premises are true and the conclusion is false, then check for a contradiction.

Alternatively, maybe I should set up the premises and the negation of the conclusion and see if there's a row where all are true.

Let me list the premises and the conclusion.

Premises:
1. H ≡ (I ∧ ~J)
2. K ≡ ~H
3. ~(K → J)

Conclusion: I ≡ J

We can rewrite the conclusion as ~I ∨ J, but since it's an equivalence, the argument is that if the premises are true, then I ≡ J must be true.

But to find if the argument is valid, we can use an indirect truth table by assuming the premises are true and the conclusion is false, then see if any such row exists. If it does, the argument is invalid, and that row is a counterexample.

Alternatively, sometimes people construct the truth table with all possible truth values and look for a row where premises are true and conclusion is false. If such a row exists, the argument is invalid.

Let me try both approaches.

First, let's define all variables: I, J, H, K.

We have four variables, so 16 possible rows. That's manageable but time-consuming. Alternatively, perhaps using the equivalence relations to simplify.

Given H ≡ (I ∧ ~J), so H can be true only if I is true and J is false.

K ≡ ~H, so K is the negation of H. So if H is true, K is false, and vice versa.

The third premise is ~(K → J). Let's recall that K → J is equivalent to ~K ∨ J. So the negation of that is K ∧ ~J. So the third premise simplifies to K ∧ ~J.

So, our premises are:

1. H ≡ (I ∧ ~J)
2. K ≡ ~H
3. K ∧ ~J

We need to see if these premises together imply I ≡ J.

Alternatively, let's write all the premises in terms of I and J because H and K depend on I and J.

From premise 1: H = I ∧ ~J.

From premise 2: K = ~H = ~(I ∧ ~J) = ~I ∨ J.

So K is equivalent to ~I ∨ J.

Now, the third premise is K ∧ ~J. Substituting K, this becomes (~I ∨ J) ∧ ~J.

Let's simplify (~I ∨ J) ∧ ~J.

This is equivalent to (~I ∧ ~J) ∨ (J ∧ ~J). Since J ∧ ~J is a contradiction (always false), this simplifies to ~I ∧ ~J.

So premise 3 simplifies to ~I ∧ ~J.

So putting it all together, our premises are:

1. H = I ∧ ~J
2. K = ~I ∨ J
3. ~I ∧ ~J

Now, the conclusion is I ≡ J, which is I ↔ J. This is equivalent to (I ∧ J) ∨ (~I ∧ ~J). But if ~I ∧ ~J is true (from premise 3), then I ≡ J is also true because both I and J are false. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no: If both I and J are false, then I ≡ J is true because both are the same (both false). So in this case, the conclusion would be true.

Wait, but that would mean that whenever the premises are true, the conclusion is also true, making the argument valid. But that can't be right because the options include invalid answers, so I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me double-check.

Wait, the premises are:

1. H ≡ I ∧ ~J
2. K ≡ ~H
3. ~(K → J) ≡ K ∧ ~J

So from 3, K ∧ ~J is true.

From 2, K = ~H = ~(I ∧ ~J) = ~I ∨ J.

So K is ~I ∨ J.

So K ∧ ~J = (~I ∨ J) ∧ ~J.

Which is equivalent to (~I ∧ ~J) ∨ (J ∧ ~J). As J ∧ ~J is false, it's ~I ∧ ~J.

So premise 3 is ~I ∧ ~J.

So in this case, I is false, J is false.

Now, the conclusion is I ≡ J, which is (I ↔ J). Since both are false, I ↔ J is true because both are the same.

So if the premises are true, the conclusion is necessarily true. Therefore, the argument should be valid, making option A correct.

Wait, but the options include various counterexamples, which suggests that perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe I should approach this using the indirect truth table method. Let's set up a truth table where premises are true and the conclusion is false, then see if any such row exists.

The premises are:

1. H ≡ (I ∧ ~J)
2. K ≡ ~H
3. ~(K → J) ≡ K ∧ ~J

Conclusion: I ≡ J.

We want to see if there's a row where premises 1,2,3 are true, and conclusion I ≡ J is false.

So, I ≡ J is false when I and J have different truth values. So either I is true and J is false, or I is false and J is true.

So let's look for a row where premises are true and I≠J.

Let me list all possible combinations where I≠J and see if the premises can be true.

Case 1: I = T, J = F

Then, from premise 1: H = I ∧ ~J = T ∧ T = T.

From premise 2: K = ~H = F.

From premise 3: K ∧ ~J = F ∧ T = F.

So premise 3 is false. So this row doesn't satisfy all premises.

Case 2: I = F, J = T

From premise 1: H = F ∧ ~T = F ∧ F = F.

From premise 2: K = ~H = T.

From premise 3: K ∧ ~J = T ∧ F = F.

So premise 3 is false again.

So in both cases where I≠J, premises 1,2,3 cannot all be true. Therefore, there is no row where premises are true and the conclusion is false. Thus, the argument is valid, making option A correct.

Wait, but the options include several invalid counterexamples. Did I do this right?

Wait, perhaps I should check the premises again.

Let me try to construct the truth table for all variables.

Variables: I, J, H, K.

H = I ∧ ~J

K = ~H = ~(I ∧ ~J) = ~I ∨ J

~(K → J) = K ∧ ~J

We need to find a row where H, K, and K ∧ ~J are true, and I ≡ J is false.

So let's list all possible I and J values and compute H, K, K ∧ ~J, and I ≡ J.

1. I=T, J=T:
   H = T ∧ F = F
   K = T
   K ∧ ~J = T ∧ F = F
   So premise 3 is false.

2. I=T, J=F:
   H = T ∧ T = T
   K = F
   K ∧ ~J = F ∧ T = F
   Premise 3 false.

3. I=F, J=T:
   H = F ∧ F = F
   K = T
   K ∧ ~J = T ∧ F = F
   Premise 3 false.

4. I=F, J=F:
   H = F ∧ T = T
   K = F
   K ∧ ~J = F ∧ T = F
   Premise 3 false.

Wait, so in all cases, premise 3 is false? That can't be right because premise 3 is ~(K → J), which would be true when K is true and J is false.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution.

Wait, let's compute again for each I and J.

Case 1: I=T, J=T

H = T ∧ ~T = T ∧ F = F

K = ~H = T

K → J = T → T = T

~(K → J) = F

So premise 3 is F.

Case 2: I=T, J=F

H = T ∧ T = T

K = ~H = F

K → J = F → F = T

~(K → J) = F

So premise 3 is F.

Case 3: I=F, J=T

H = F ∧ F = F

K = T

K → J = T → T = T

~(K → J) = F

Case 4: I=F, J=F

H = F ∧ T = T

K = F

K → J = F → F = T

~(K → J) = F

Wait, in all cases, premise 3 is F? That can't be. Because when K is T and J is F, premise 3 should be T.

Wait, let's see:

Wait, K is ~H, which is ~ (I ∧ ~J). So when I is F and J is T, K is T.

Wait, let's take I=F, J=F.

H = F ∧ T = T

K = ~H = F

So K is F. Then, K → J = F → F = T. So ~(K → J) = F.

But what about when K is T and J is F? Let's see when K is T.

K is T when H is F, which happens when I is F or J is T.

Wait, let's pick I=F, J=F.

Wait, no, if I=F and J=F, H is T, so K is F.

Wait, is there a case where K is T and J is F?

Yes, when H is F. H is F when either I is F or J is T.

So, let's take I=F, J=F: H=T, K=F.

No, that's not K=T.

Wait, let's take I=F, J=T: H=F, K=T.

Then, J=T. So K → J = T → T = T. So ~(K → J) = F.

Wait, but what if J is F and K is T?

We need to find a case where K=T and J=F.

So when does K=T?

K=T when H=F, which is when I=F or J=T.

So if I=F and J=F, H=T, K=F. Not the case.

If I=F and J=T, H=F, K=T.

In this case, J=T, so K ∧ ~J would be T ∧ F = F.

Wait, so when does K=T and J=F happen?

It doesn't seem possible because K=T only when H=F, which requires either I=F or J=T. So if J=F, then K=T only if I=F and J=F? No, because H would be I ∧ ~J.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me try different I and J values.

Let me try I=T, J=F.

H = T ∧ T = T

K = ~H = F

So K=F, J=F.

Then K ∧ ~J = F ∧ T = F.

So premise 3 is F.

Another case: I=F, J=T.

H=F ∧ F=F

K=T

J=T

K ∧ ~J = T ∧ F = F.

Hmm, still F.

Wait, when would K=T and J=F?

We need K=T and J=F.

K=T when H=F, which is when I=F or J=T.

So to have J=F and K=T, we need H=F, which requires I=F or J=T. But J=F, so J=T is not possible. So H=F requires I=F.

So I=F, J=F.

Then H= I ∧ ~J = F ∧ T = T.

K= ~H = F.

So K=F. So K ∧ ~J = F ∧ T = F.

So premise 3 is F.

Wait, is there any case where K=T and J=F?

It seems not. Because when J=F, H is I ∧ T. So H would be T if I=T.

So K= ~H = F.

Alternatively, if I=F, H=F, so K=T. But then J=F.

Wait, I=F, J=F: H=T, K=F.

I=F, J=F: H=T, K=F.

Wait, but if I=F and J=F, H=I ∧ ~J=F ∧ T=T.

So K=F.

So K=T only when H=F, which is when I=F or J=T.

So when J=F, K=T only if I=F and J=F? No, because if J=F, then H=F only if I=F.

Wait, I=F, J=F: H=F ∧ T=T.

Wait, no, H=I ∧ ~J. So if I=F and J=F, ~J=T. So H=F ∧ T=F.

Wait, no, F ∧ T is F. So H=F.

Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier.

Let me recalculate H when I=F and J=F.

H= I ∧ ~J.

I=F, J=F. So ~J=T.

So H=F ∧ T=F.

So H=F.

Therefore, K= ~H=T.

So K=T when I=F and J=F.

Ah, okay, that's the case I was missing.

So in this case:

I=F, J=F.

H= F ∧ T=F.

K= ~H=T.

So K=T, J=F.

Thus, K ∧ ~J = T ∧ T=T.

So premise 3 is T.

So in this case, all premises are true.

Now, the conclusion is I ≡ J.

I=F, J=F. So I ≡ J is T.

Wait, but we're looking for a case where the premises are true and the conclusion is false, to show the argument is invalid.

In this case, conclusion is true. So no contradiction.

Wait, but let's see other possibilities.

Wait, let's take I=T, J=F.

H=T ∧ T=T.

K= ~H=F.

K ∧ ~J=F ∧ T=F.

So premise 3 is F.

Another case: I=F, J=T.

H=F ∧ F=F.

K=T.

K ∧ ~J=T ∧ F=F.

So premise 3 is F.

The only case where premise 3 is T is when I=F and J=F.

In that case, I ≡ J is T.

So there's no row where premises are T and conclusion is F.

Therefore, the argument is valid, so option A is correct.

Wait, but the options include several invalid options with counterexamples. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, perhaps I should check all possibilities again.

Wait, when I=F, J=F:

H= I ∧ ~J = F ∧ T=F.

Wait, no, F ∧ T is F. So H=F.

K= ~H=T.

So K=T.

J=F.

So K ∧ ~J= T ∧ T=T.

Thus, premise 3 is T.

Conclusion: I ≡ J. I=F, J=F. So I ≡ J=T.

So in this case, all premises are T, and conclusion is T.

No row where premises are T and conclusion is F.

Thus, the argument is valid, so option A is correct.

But the options include other possibilities. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, perhaps the conclusion is I ≡ J, but the argument is supposed to derive that from the premises. So if in all possible cases where premises are true, the conclusion is also true, the argument is valid.

Yes, that's what I found.

So the correct answer should be A: Valid.

But looking back at the options, option A is "Valid". So the answer is A.
</think>

The argument is valid because in all cases where the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true. There is no counterexample where the premises are true and the conclusion is false.
