Question:

A contractor agreed to remodel a homeowner's garage for $5,000. Just before the parties signed the one-page written contract, the homeowner called to the contractor's attention the fact that the contract did not specify a time of completion. The parties orally agreed but did not specify in the contract that the contractor would complete the work in 60 days, and then they both signed the contract. The contract did not contain a merger clause. The contractor failed to finish the work in 60 days. The homeowner has sued the contractor for breach of contract. Is the court likely to admit evidence concerning the parties' oral agreement that the work would be completed in 60 days?

Options:

A: No, because the oral agreement contradicts the written contract.
B: Yes, because the homeowner brought up the time limit before signing the contract.
C: Yes, because the homeowner can provide evidence of the oral agreement.
D: Yes, because the time limit is an additional term that does not contradict the partially integrated written contract.
E: No, because the oral agreement is considered hearsay.
F: No, because the contract is a fully integrated written contract.
G: Yes, because the court can consider oral agreements in absence of a merger clause.
H: No, because the court must ascertain the meaning of the agreement from the terms of the written contract.
I: Yes, because the contract is ambiguous.
J: No, because the oral agreement was merely part of the parties' negotiations.

Okay, so I've got this contracts question here, and I need to figure it out. Let's break it down step by step.

The situation is that a contractor agreed to remodel a garage for $5,000. They had a one-page written contract, but just before signing, the homeowner pointed out that the contract didn't specify a time of completion. So they orally agreed that the contractor would finish in 60 days, but didn't put that in writing. Then they both signed. The contract didn't have a merger clause either. Later, the contractor didn't finish on time, and the homeowner sued for breach. The question is whether the court will admit evidence of their oral agreement about the 60-day completion.

I remember that when a contract is written, there's the issue of whether it's an integrated agreement. If it's a fully integrated contract, then any prior agreements are merged into the written one, and you can't introduce evidence of those prior oral agreements. But if it's only a partially integrated contract, then the written version doesn't exclude other terms, and you can bring in evidence of those prior agreements or subsequent modifications.

So in this case, the contract didn't have a merger clause. That's important because a merger clause would say that the written contract supersedes all prior agreements and understandings. Without that, the contract is considered partially integrated. So under the common law, even without a merger clause, if the written contract is detailed and looks like it was intended to be the whole agreement, it might be seen as a fully integrated contract. But I think the absence of a merger clause makes it more likely that it's only partially integrated.

The issue here is whether the oral agreement about the 60-day completion is admissible. The contract didn't specify the time, so the homeowner wants to show that they orally agreed to that term. Since the written contract didn't include it, and there's no merger clause, the court should allow evidence of the oral agreement. 

Looking at the options:

A says no because the oral agreement contradicts the written contract. But the written contract didn't have a time, so it's not a contradiction. Plus, without a merger clause, the oral term can be added.

B says yes because the homeowner brought up the time before signing. That's true, but the key is whether the contract is integrated. Since there's no merger clause, the oral term can be considered.

C says yes because the homeowner can provide evidence of the oral agreement. That seems right, but I need to see if there's a rule against it.

D says yes because the time is an additional term not contradicting the partially integrated contract. That makes sense because without a merger clause, the written contract isn't considered the whole agreement, so additional terms can be added.

E says no because the oral agreement is hearsay. Wait, but in contract cases, prior agreements are not hearsay because they're being offered to prove the existence of the contract, not for the truth of the matter. So E is incorrect.

F says no because the contract is a fully integrated written contract. But without a merger clause, it's only partially integrated, so F is wrong.

G says yes because the court can consider oral agreements in the absence of a merger clause. That sounds correct because without a merger clause, prior agreements can be admitted.

H says no because the court must look only at the written terms. But again, without a merger clause, the court can consider other evidence.

I says yes because the contract is ambiguous. But the contract wasn't ambiguous; it just didn't mention the time. So I don't think ambiguity is the issue here.

J says no because the oral agreement was part of negotiations. But once the contract is signed, prior negotiations can be considered if the contract isn't fully integrated.

So the key points are whether the contract is partially or fully integrated. Without a merger clause, it's more likely partially integrated, so the oral agreement can be admitted. So options D and G seem relevant.

Option D says it's an additional term not contradicting the partially integrated contract. Option G says the court can consider oral agreements without a merger clause.

I think both D and G are correct in their reasoning, but the correct answer depends on the specifics of the law. Under the common law, the absence of a merger clause doesn't automatically make the contract partially integrated; it's more about whether the written contract appears to be the entire agreement. But here, since the contract didn't specify the time, and they orally agreed, the court would allow evidence of that because the written contract isn't fully integrated. So G seems correct, but D also makes sense because the term is additional.

Wait, but the question is about whether the evidence is admissible. Under the rules of evidence, prior agreements are admissible unless the contract is fully integrated. Without a merger clause, the contract isn't fully integrated, so the evidence is admissible. So G is correct.

Alternatively, D says it's an additional term, which is also correct, but perhaps G is more direct. So which option is better?

Looking again, the issue is whether the oral agreement is admissible. The answer is yes because without a merger clause, the oral agreement can be admitted. So G is correct.

The key issue is whether the oral agreement about the 60-day completion is admissible when the written contract lacks a merger clause. Without a merger clause, the contract is considered partially integrated, meaning prior agreements can be admitted as evidence. Therefore, the court is likely to admit the oral agreement.
