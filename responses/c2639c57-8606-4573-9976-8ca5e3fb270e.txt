Okay, so I have this question here: Let x = 1. What is x << 3 in Python 3? The options are A through J, with numbers like 16, 4, 8, etc. Hmm, I need to figure out what the answer is.

First, I remember that the << operator in Python is a bitwise left shift. Bitwise operations can be a bit tricky, but I think I get the basics. Left shifting means moving the bits of the number to the left. Each shift effectively multiplies the number by 2, right? Because each position in binary represents a power of two.

So, x is 1. Let me think about what 1 looks like in binary. Oh right, 1 in binary is just 1. Now, when I do a left shift by 3 positions, I'm moving that 1 three places to the left. Let me visualize it: 1 becomes 10, then 100, then 1000 in binary after each shift. So shifting once gives 2, twice gives 4, three times gives 8. So x << 3 should be 8.

Wait, let me make sure I'm not mixing up left and right shifts. Right shifts would divide by 2, but left shifts multiply by 2 for each position. So yeah, 1 shifted left by 3 is 8. Looking at the options, option C is 8. So the answer should be C.

The answer is C: 8.

Step-by-step explanation:
- The << operator in Python performs a bitwise left shift.
- Shifting 1 (binary: 1) left by 3 positions results in 1000 in binary, which is 8 in decimal.

Answer: C
