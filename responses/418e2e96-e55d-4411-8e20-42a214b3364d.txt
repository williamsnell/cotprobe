Okay, so I have this transformer problem to solve, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me take it slow because I'm still getting the hang of transformers and their calculations.

The question has three parts: (a), (b), and (c). Each part requires some calculation, and I need to pick the correct option from A to J. Let's go through each part one by one.

Starting with part (a): Calculate the mutual flux φ_m. Hmm, mutual flux... I remember that mutual flux is related to the primary voltage, the number of turns, and the frequency. Oh right, the formula for mutual flux (φ_m) is given by:

φ_m = (V_p * N_p) / (2 * π * f)

Where:
- V_p is the primary voltage,
- N_p is the number of primary turns,
- f is the frequency in Hz.

Wait, is that right? Let me make sure. Oh yes, because mutual flux is the flux that links all the turns of the primary and secondary, so it's the same for both. The formula comes from Faraday's law of induction, considering the AC nature of the voltage.

Given:
- Primary voltage, V_p = 2300 volts,
- N_p = 4800 turns,
- f = 60 Hz.

Plugging in the numbers:

φ_m = (2300 * 4800) / (2 * π * 60)

Let me compute that step by step.

First, multiply 2300 by 4800. Let's see, 2300 * 4800. Hmm, 23 * 48 is 1104, so 2300 * 4800 = 11,040,000.

Next, the denominator: 2 * π * 60. 2 * 60 is 120, so 120 * π ≈ 120 * 3.1416 ≈ 376.992.

So φ_m = 11,040,000 / 376.992 ≈ Let me calculate that. 

11,040,000 ÷ 377 ≈ Let's see, 377 * 29,000 = 377 * 30,000 is 11,310,000, which is a bit more. So 29,000 would give 377*29,000=10,933,000. Wait, no, that's 377*29,000. Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute 11,040,000 ÷ 376.992.

Let me calculate 11,040,000 ÷ 377 ≈ Let's see:

377 * 29,000 = 377 * 29,000 = let's compute 377*30,000=11,310,000, so 377*29,000=11,310,000 - 377*1000=11,310,000 - 377,000=10,933,000.

So 10,933,000 is 377*29,000. Our numerator is 11,040,000, which is 107,000 more. So 107,000 ÷ 377 ≈ approx 283. So total is 29,000 + 283 ≈ 29,283. So φ_m ≈ 29,283 maxwells. Wait, but looking at the options, the answers are in 10^5 maxwells. Hmm, maybe I made a miscalculation.

Wait, wait, perhaps I messed up the initial calculation. Let me double-check:

Wait, 2300 volts, 4800 turns. So 2300 * 4800 = let's compute that again. 2300 * 4800: 2300 * 4800 = (2300 * 48) * 100. 23*48=1104, so 1104 * 100 = 110,400, then multiplied by 100 again because 2300 is 23*100, and 4800 is 48*100. So total is 110,400 * 100 = 11,040,000, yes, correct.

Denominator: 2 * π * 60 ≈ 2 * 3.1416 *60 = 376.992.

So 11,040,000 ÷ 376.992 ≈ let me compute it more accurately.

Let me compute 376.992 * 29,283 ≈ 376.992 * 29,283. But perhaps it's easier to compute 11,040,000 / 376.992.

Let me compute 376.992 * 29,283:

Wait, perhaps I should use a calculator approach, but since I can't, maybe I can approximate.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Wait, let me think again: mutual flux is φ = V * N / (ω), where ω is 2πf. So yes, the formula is correct.

Wait, but wait, another thought: mutual flux is also given by φ = B * A, where B is the flux density and A is the cross-sectional area. But I don't think that's needed here since the formula I used is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately. Let me try:

376.992 * 29,283. Let me see: 376.992 * 29,283 ≈ 376.992 * 29,283 ≈ 376.992 * 29,000 = 376.992 *29,000 = 376.992 *29 *1000.

376.992 *29: Let's compute 377 *29.

377 * 29: 377*30=11,310, minus 377 → 11,310 - 377 = 10,933. So 376.992 *29 ≈ 10,933.

So 376.992 *29,000 ≈ 10,933,000.

So 376.992 *29,283 = 10,933,000 + (376.992 *283). Hmm, 376.992 *283 is about 377 *283 ≈ 377*280=105,560 and 377*3=1,131 → total 106,691.

So total is 10,933,000 + 106,691 = 11,039,691. That's very close to 11,040,000. So the mutual flux φ_m is approximately 29,283 maxwells. Wait, but wait, that's 29,283, which is 2.9283 ×10^4 maxwells. But looking at the options, the answers for part (a) are in the 10^5 range. Wait, that's way off. Did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Wait, no, wait a second. 2300 V, 4800 turns. Wait, maybe I have a mistake in the formula. Oh! Wait, mutual flux is usually given in Weber, but sometimes in maxwells. Oh wait, 1 Weber = 1 maxwell. So 1 Wb = 1 Mx.

Wait, but let me double-check the formula. The mutual flux φ_m is given by:

φ_m = (V_p * N_p) / (2πf)

But wait, is that correct? Because V_p is the RMS voltage, and the flux is the RMS flux. So yes, that formula should give the correct value in Weber (or maxwells).

Wait, but 2300 V is the primary voltage. So V_p is 2300 V, N_p is 4800 turns, f is 60 Hz.

So let me compute it again:

φ_m = (2300 * 4800) / (2 * π * 60)

Compute numerator: 2300 * 4800 = 11,040,000.

Denominator: 2 * π *60 = 120π ≈ 376.991.

So φ_m ≈ 11,040,000 / 376.991 ≈ Let's compute this division.

Dividing 11,040,000 by 376.991:

We can approximate this as:

376.991 ≈ 377.

So 11,040,000 ÷ 377 ≈ Let's see:

377 * 29,283 ≈ 11,040,000 as I calculated before, so φ_m ≈ 29,283 Mx? Wait, no, wait, 377 * 29,283 = 11,040,000, so 29,283 is the result of 11,040,000 /377, which is 29,283 Mx. Wait, but 29,283 Mx is 2.9283 × 10^4 Mx, which is 29,283 Mx, but looking at the options, options are in 1e5 Mx. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait a minute, perhaps I confused volts with something else. Oh wait, no, let me check the units again.

Wait, 2300 volts is correct. 4800 turns, correct. 60 cycles, correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a unit mistake. Let me check the formula again. Oh! Wait, is the formula in terms of volts, turns, and frequency in Hz? Yes.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula φ = (V_p * N_p) / (ω), where ω is 2πf. So same as before.

Wait, but 2300 * 4800 = 11,040,000.

Divided by 2π*60 = 376.991, gives 29,283 Mx, which is 2.9283e4 Mx. But none of the options for part (a) are close to that. The options start from 1.5e5 to 2.4e5. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the formula is φ = (V_p * N_p * 1000) / (2πf)? Because sometimes in some contexts, you have to account for phase or something else. Or maybe I'm missing a factor of 1000 because of the way voltage is expressed.

Wait, no, voltage is in volts, which is consistent. Hmm. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps mutual flux is given in Weber, which is 1 Wb = 1 maxwell. So 1 Wb is 1 Mx. So the units are correct.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute 11,040,000 divided by 376.991 again.

Wait, 376.991 * 29,000 = 10,933,000. So 29,000 gives 10,933,000. Then 11,040,000 - 10,933,000 = 107,000. Now, 107,000 ÷ 376.991 ≈ 283.7. So total is 29,000 + 283.7 ≈ 29,283.7 Mx. So ≈29,284 Mx, which is 2.9284 ×10^4 Mx.

But looking at the options, the closest option for (a) is option H: 1.8e5 Mx, which is way higher. So I must have done something wrong.

Wait, perhaps I mixed up primary and secondary parameters? No, part (a) is about the primary. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should consider that the mutual flux is the same for both windings, but perhaps the formula is different. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute it using the secondary parameters after finding the turns ratio.

Wait, perhaps the mutual flux is also given by φ = V_s * N_s / (2πf), but I don't know N_s yet because part (b) is asking for that. Hmm, but for part (a), I think I have to use the primary parameters.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check 2300 *4800 = 11,040,000. Yes. 2π*60 = 376.991. So 11,040,000 ÷ 376.991 ≈ 29,283 Mx. But none of the options match. So maybe I'm using the wrong formula.

Wait, another approach: mutual flux can also be calculated using the primary current and the primary turns, but without knowing the current, that's not helpful. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula involving the induced EMF.

Wait, the induced EMF in the primary is given by E = N_p * dΦ/dt. But since it's AC, the average EMF is N_p * 2πf Φ_m. Wait, that's the formula. So rearranged, Φ_m = E_p / (2πf N_p). Wait, no, E_p = N_p * (dΦ/dt). Since Φ is sinusoidal, dΦ/dt = 2πf Φ_m. So E_p = N_p * 2πf Φ_m. Therefore, Φ_m = E_p / (2πf N_p). Wait, but E_p is the peak voltage or the RMS? Oh, right, for RMS, E_p (RMS) = N_p * 2πf Φ_m (RMS). So Φ_m (RMS) = E_p (RMS) / (2πf N_p).

Wait, but the primary voltage given is 2300 V. Assuming it's RMS, so E_p = 2300 V. So Φ_m = 2300 / (2 * π * 60 * 4800)

Wait, let me compute that:

Denominator: 2 * π * 60 * 4800 = 2 * 3.1416 *60 *4800 ≈ 2 *3.1416≈6.2832; 6.2832*60≈376.992; 376.992 *4800≈1,809,562.

So Φ_m = 2300 / 1,809,562 ≈ 0.00127 Wb ≈ 1270 Mx. Wait, that's 1.27 ×10^3 Mx, which is way lower than the options. So I must have messed up the formula.

Wait, perhaps I have the formula wrong. Let me think again: E = N * dΦ/dt. For a sinusoidal voltage, E = N * 2πf Φ_m. So Φ_m = E / (2πf N). So yes, that's correct.

So E is 2300 V, N is 4800 turns, f is 60 Hz.

So Φ_m = 2300 / (2 * π *60 *4800) = 2300 / (2 *3.1416 *60 *4800).

Compute denominator: 2*3.1416=6.2832; 6.2832 *60=376.992; 376.992 *4800=1,809,562. So 2300 /1,809,562 ≈ 0.00127 Wb = 1270 Mx. So 1.27e3 Mx.

But the options for (a) are 1e5 to 2.4e5. So 1.27e3 is way lower. So I must have made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps I should use dB instead of dΦ/dt. No, that's not right. Wait, maybe I should consider that mutual flux is the same in both windings, but perhaps I'm using the wrong approach.

Wait, another thought: mutual flux is also given by B * A, where B is flux density and A is the area. But without knowing B or A, that's not helpful here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the induced EMF in the primary and then find φ_m from that.

Wait, another approach: The induced EMF in the primary is given by E_p = 2πf N_p φ_m. So φ_m = E_p / (2πf N_p). So that's the same as before, which gave me 1270 Mx. But that's not matching any option.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing mutual flux with something else. Maybe the problem is asking for the maximum flux, not the RMS flux. Oh! Wait, in AC, the flux is sinusoidal, so the maximum flux would be Φ_m = Φ_peak. But in the formula, we usually use the RMS value. So perhaps the question is asking for the peak flux, which would be Φ_peak = Φ_rms * sqrt(2).

Wait, but in the options, the answers for (a) are in 1e5 range. Let me see, if Φ_rms is 1.27e3 Mx, then Φ_peak would be about 1.27e3 * 1.414 ≈ 1.79e3 Mx, which is still way lower than the options.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look at part (b) first, and see if that helps, as perhaps part (a) is a miscalculation and part (b) can be solved, and then cross-check with the options.

Part (b): Calculate the number of turns in the 230-volt secondary winding.

I know that in a transformer, the voltage ratio is proportional to the turns ratio. So V_p / V_s = N_p / N_s. So N_s = (V_s * N_p) / V_p.

Given:
V_p = 2300 V,
V_s = 230 V,
N_p = 4800 turns.

So N_s = (230 * 4800) / 2300.

Let me compute that:

230 *4800 = 1,104,000.

Divided by 2300: 1,104,000 /2300 ≈ Let's compute.

2300 * 480 = 1,104,000. So N_s = 480 turns.

So the secondary has 480 turns. Looking at the options, which option has part (b) as 480 turns? Let's check the options:

Option H: (b) 480 turns.

Option I: 450.

Option C: 440.

Option B: 470.

Option F: 490.

Option H is 480, which matches our calculation. So part (b) is 480 turns. So looking at the options, only H and maybe others have 480.

Now, let's go back to part (a). Since part (a) is mutual flux, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me try another approach.

Wait, mutual flux is also given by φ_m = (V_p * N_p) / (2πf). But perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute it again with more precision.

V_p = 2300 V,
N_p =4800,
f=60.

So φ_m = (2300 *4800) / (2 * π *60).

Compute numerator: 2300 *4800 = 11,040,000.

Denominator: 2 * π *60 = 376.991.

So φ_m = 11,040,000 / 376.991 ≈ Let me compute this more accurately.

Let me compute 11,040,000 ÷ 376.991.

We can approximate 376.991 as 377, as before.

So 377 * 29,283 = 11,040,000, as I calculated earlier. So φ_m ≈29,283 Mx, which is 2.9283e4 Mx.

But looking at the options, none of the (a) parts are close to this. The closest is option H: (a) 1.8e5, which is way higher. So perhaps I'm missing a factor of 6.2832 (which is 2π) somewhere.

Wait, wait a second, maybe I should compute the maximum flux instead of the RMS flux. Because in the problem statement, part (c) refers to the maximum flux, which is given as 3.76e6 Mx. So perhaps part (a) is also asking for the maximum flux, not the mutual flux? Or perhaps I'm confusing the terms.

Wait, the question says: (a) the mutual flux φ_m. Hmm, mutual flux is usually the RMS value, but sometimes people refer to the peak flux as φ_m.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the peak flux. Let's try that. So, if φ_rms is 29,283 Mx, then the peak flux φ_peak = φ_rms * sqrt(2) ≈ 29,283 *1.414 ≈41,400 Mx, which is 4.14e4 Mx. Still not matching the options.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute using the secondary parameters.

Wait, since I know the turns ratio, perhaps I can compute the secondary parameters and find the mutual flux from there.

The turns ratio K = N_p / N_s = 4800 / 480 = 10. So the voltage ratio is 10:1, so the secondary voltage is 230 V, as given.

The mutual flux is the same in both windings. So using the secondary, φ_m = V_s * N_s / (2πf).

So φ_m = 230 *480 / (2 * π *60).

Compute numerator: 230 *480 = 110,400.

Denominator: 2 * π *60 ≈376.991.

So φ_m = 110,400 /376.991 ≈ 292.83 Mx. Wait, that's even smaller, which can't be right because mutual flux should be the same regardless of which winding you use.

Wait, that's impossible. I must have made a mistake here. Wait, if I compute using the secondary, I get 292.83 Mx, but using the primary, I get 29,283 Mx. That can't be. So I must have made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the mutual flux is the same in both windings, so using the primary gives φ_m =29,283 Mx, using the secondary gives φ_m=292.83 Mx, which is a contradiction. That can't be right, so I must have made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that mutual flux is the same, but the induced EMF in each winding depends on the number of turns. So perhaps I'm using the wrong formula.

Wait, let me think again. The mutual flux is the same for both windings, so the formula using the primary should give the same result as using the secondary. But I'm getting conflicting results, which suggests I'm making a mistake.

Wait, when I use the primary:

φ_m = (V_p * N_p) / (2πf) = (2300 *4800) / (2π*60) ≈29,283 Mx.

Using the secondary:

φ_m = (V_s * N_s) / (2πf) = (230 *480) / (2π*60) = 110,400 /376.991 ≈292.83 Mx.

But these are not the same, which is impossible. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps I should use V_p * N_p = V_s * N_s, which is true because the voltage ratio equals the turns ratio. So V_p * N_p = V_s * N_s = 2300 *4800 =230 *4800? Wait, no, because N_s =480, so 230 *480 =110,400, which is not equal to 2300 *4800=11,040,000. So that's not correct. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, no, that's not correct. The voltage ratio is V_p / V_s = N_p / N_s. So V_p * N_s = V_s * N_p. So 2300 *480 =230 *4800. Let's check: 2300 *480 =1,104,000. 230 *4800=1,104,000. So that's correct. So the product V*N is the same for both windings, which makes sense because the mutual flux is the same.

Wait, but when I compute φ_m using V_p * N_p / (2πf), I get 29,283 Mx, and using V_s * N_s / (2πf), I get 292.83 Mx. Which is a factor of 100 difference. That suggests that I'm missing a factor of 100 somewhere. Where could that be?

Ah! Oh wait, I think I see the mistake. The formula for mutual flux is φ_m = V_p * N_p / (2πf * 1000). Because voltage is in volts, which is 1000 times millivolts, and flux is in maxwells, which is 1000 times smaller than Weber. Wait, no, 1 Weber is 1 maxwell. So why would there be a factor of 1000?

Wait, perhaps I confused volts with kilovolts. Let me check the units.

Wait, 2300 volts is correct. So when I compute (2300 *4800), that's 11,040,000, which is in (V * turns). But to get flux in maxwells, which is V*s/turn, I think I need to consider that V is in volts, which is J/C (joules per coulomb), and flux is Wb (webers), which is V*s.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula φ_m = (V_p * N_p) / (ω), where ω is 2πf in radians per second.

So ω =2π*60 ≈376.991 rad/s.

So φ_m = (2300 *4800) /376.991 ≈ (11,040,000) /376.991 ≈29,283 Wb. Wait, but 1 Wb is 1 Mx, so 29,283 Wb is 29,283 Mx. But that's still not matching the options.

Wait, but looking at the options, the (a) parts are in the 1e5 range. So 29,283 is 2.9e4, which is an order of magnitude less than the options. So perhaps I'm missing a factor of 100 somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the formula should be φ_m = (V_p * N_p *1000) / (2πf), because voltage is in volts and flux is in maxwells, and 1 V = 1 J/C, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula φ_m = (V_p * N_p) / (2πf *1000), to account for kilovolts? Let me try that.

So φ_m = (2300 *4800) / (2π*60*1000) =11,040,000 / (376.991 *1000) ≈11,040,000 / 376,991 ≈29.283 Mx. Still not matching.

Wait, another thought: perhaps mutual flux is given by φ_m = (V_p * N_p) / (2πf *1000), because voltage is in volts and flux is in maxwells. Let me compute that.

(2300 *4800) / (2π*60*1000) =11,040,000 / (376.991 *1000) ≈11,040,000 /376,991 ≈29.283 Mx. Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that mutual flux is in the order of 1e5 Mx, which would require that the calculation gives around 1e5. Let me see, what if I forgot to multiply by 1000 somewhere. Let's see:

If I compute (2300 *4800 *1000) / (2π*60), that would be 11,040,000,000 /376.991 ≈29,283,000 Mx, which is 2.9e7 Mx, which is way higher than the options.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for another approach. Let's consider that mutual flux is the same in both windings, so using the secondary:

φ_m = (V_s * N_s) / (2πf) = (230 *480) / (2π*60) ≈(110,400)/(376.991)≈292.83 Mx. So 2.9283e2 Mx. Again, not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the maximum flux, not the RMS flux. So if the mutual flux is 29,283 Mx RMS, then the peak flux would be 29,283 * sqrt(2) ≈41,400 Mx, which is 4.14e4 Mx. Still not matching the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual flux is given in Weber, which is 1e6 maxwells. So 29,283 Wb is 2.9283e4 Mx, which is 29.283 Mx. No, that's still not matching.

Wait, perhaps I'm using the wrong formula entirely. Let me think about mutual inductance. Mutual inductance M is given by M = (k * sqrt(L1 * L2)), but I don't think that's relevant here.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual flux is given by φ = B * A, where B is the flux density and A is the area. But without knowing B or A, that's not helpful.

Wait, perhaps I should look at part (c) to see if that helps. Part (c) says: the maximum flux in the core of a 60-cycle transformer with 1320 primary turns and 46 secondary turns is 3.76 ×10^6 maxwells. Also, calculate the primary and secondary induced voltages.

Wait, but part (c) is a separate problem, perhaps a different transformer. So maybe part (c) is a different scenario, but perhaps the options are linked, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but the user's question is one problem with three parts, all about the same transformer. So (a) and (b) are about the first transformer, and (c) is another part, perhaps about a different transformer. Wait, no, the user wrote: "Calculate: (a) the mutual flux φ_m; (b) the number of turns in the 230-volt secondary winding; (c) the maximum flux..." So perhaps (c) is part of the same transformer. Let me read again.

No, the user wrote: The last part of the question is (c): "the maximum flux in the core of a 60-cycle transformer that has 1320 primary turns and 46 secondary turns is 3.76 ×10^6 maxwells. Also, calculate the primary and secondary induced voltages."

Wait, maybe (c) is about a different transformer, so perhaps the given maximum flux is for a different setup. So part (c) is a separate calculation, which may help in matching the options.

But for part (a), I'm stuck. Let me try to think differently. Maybe mutual flux is given by φ = V_p * t / (2πf), where t is the time. But without time, that's not helpful.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that mutual flux is the same in both windings, so using the secondary, φ_m = V_s * N_s / (2πf). So with V_s =230 V, N_s=480 turns, f=60.

So φ_m = (230 *480) / (2π*60) ≈ (110,400) /376.991 ≈292.83 Mx. But that's 2.9283e2 Mx, which is 292.83 Mx, which is 2.93e2 Mx. Looking at the options, the (a) parts are in 1e5 range. So perhaps I'm missing a factor of 1000 somewhere. If I multiply by 1000, I get 292,830 Mx, which is 2.928e5 Mx, which is close to option H's (a) 1.8e5, but not quite.

Wait, but 292,830 Mx is 2.928e5 Mx, which is 292,830 Mx. Looking at the options, option E has (a) 2.2e5, option F: 2.0e5, option H: 1.8e5, option B:1.9e5. So none match exactly, but option B is 1.9e5, which is close.

But earlier, using the primary, I got 29,283 Mx, which is 2.928e4 Mx. So perhaps I have a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the mutual flux is calculated using the formula φ = (V_p * N_p) / (2πf). But if I multiply by 1000, perhaps because of kilovolts, then φ = (2300 *4800 *1000) / (2π*60) =11,040,000,000 /376.991 ≈2.928e7 Mx, which is way higher than the options.

I'm stuck. Maybe I should move on to part (c) and see if it helps. Let's see.

Part (c): Maximum flux in the core is 3.76 ×10^6 maxwells. Calculate primary and secondary induced voltages.

Given:
- Primary turns, N_p =1320,
- Secondary turns, N_s=46,
- Maximum flux, Φ_max =3.76e6 Mx.

The induced EMF in a transformer is given by E = N * dΦ/dt. For maximum EMF, when dΦ/dt is maximum, which occurs at the peak rate of change of flux.

The maximum rate of change of flux is dΦ/dt_max = 2πf Φ_max.

So the maximum EMF in the primary is E_p_max = N_p * dΦ/dt_max.

Similarly, for the secondary, E_s_max = N_s * dΦ/dt_max.

So let's compute dΦ/dt_max first.

dΦ/dt_max = 2πf Φ_max.

Given f=60 Hz, Φ_max=3.76e6 Mx.

So dΦ/dt_max = 2 * π *60 *3.76e6.

Compute:

2 * π ≈6.2832,
6.2832 *60 ≈376.992,
376.992 *3.76e6 ≈ Let's compute 376.992 *3.76e6.

3.76e6 *376.992 ≈ (3.76 *376.992) *1e6.

Compute 3.76 *376.992:

3 *376.992=1,130.976,
0.76 *376.992 ≈287.354,
Total ≈1,130.976 +287.354 ≈1,418.33.

So dΦ/dt_max ≈1,418.33e6 maxwells/second.

Now, compute E_p_max = N_p * dΦ/dt_max =1320 *1,418.33e6.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, dΦ/dt_max is in maxwells/second, and N_p is turns, so E_p_max = N_p * dΦ/dt_max.

So E_p_max =1320 *1,418.33e6.

Wait, that can't be right because 1,418.33e6 is already a huge number, leading to an extremely high voltage, which is not practical. I must have made a mistake.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The flux is given in maxwells, so 3.76e6 Mx. The rate of change is dΦ/dt = 2πf Φ. So dΦ/dt = 2π*60*3.76e6.

Wait, but 3.76e6 Mx is 3.76e6 Wb, which is a very high flux. Let me compute dΦ/dt:

dΦ/dt = 2π*60*3.76e6 ≈376.992 *3.76e6 ≈1.418e9 Wb/s.

So E_p_max =1320 *1.418e9 ≈1.872e12 V. That's way too high, which is impossible. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the flux is given as 3.76e6 maxwells, which is 3.76e-6 Weber, because 1 Wb =1e6 Mx. So 3.76e6 Mx =3.76 Wb.

Ah! That's the mistake. I was treating 3.76e6 Mx as 3.76e6 Wb, but actually, 1 Wb =1e6 Mx, so 3.76e6 Mx =3.76 Wb.

So let me correct that.

dΦ/dt_max =2πf Φ_max =2π*60*3.76 Wb.

Compute:

2π*60 ≈376.992,
376.992 *3.76 ≈1,418.33 Wb/s.

Now, E_p_max =N_p * dΦ/dt_max =1320 *1,418.33 ≈1,872,000 V, which is 1.872e6 V, or approximately 1.87 MV. That's a very high voltage, which is unlikely. So perhaps I'm making a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the flux is given in maxwells, which is correct, but when calculating EMF, it's better to use RMS values. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the RMS EMF.

Wait, the maximum EMF is E_p_max = N_p * 2πf Φ_max.

So E_p_rms = E_p_max / sqrt(2) = (N_p *2πf Φ_max)/sqrt(2).

Similarly for the secondary.

So let's compute E_p_rms:

E_p_rms = (1320 *2π*60 *3.76) / sqrt(2).

Compute numerator: 1320 *2π*60 ≈1320 *376.992 ≈500,000 (exact value: 1320 *376.992 ≈500,000).

Wait, 1320 *376.992 = let's compute:

1320 *300=396,000,
1320 *76.992≈1320*70=92,400; 1320*6.992≈9,278.64. So total ≈92,400 +9,278.64≈101,678.64.

So total ≈396,000 +101,678.64 ≈497,678.64.

Multiply by 3.76: 497,678.64 *3.76 ≈ Let's compute:

497,678.64 *3 =1,493,035.92,
497,678.64 *0.76 ≈378,532.06,
Total ≈1,493,035.92 +378,532.06 ≈1,871,567.98.

Now divide by sqrt(2)≈1.4142:

E_p_rms ≈1,871,567.98 /1.4142 ≈1,322,000 V ≈1.322e6 V, which is still extremely high. That can't be right, so I must have made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the flux is given as peak flux, and I should compute the RMS EMF. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the maximum EMF as E = N * 2πf Φ.

Wait, let me compute E_p_rms = N_p * (2πf) * (Φ_max / sqrt(2))).

Because the flux is sinusoidal, the RMS flux is Φ_max / sqrt(2).

So E_p_rms = N_p * 2πf * (Φ_max / sqrt(2)).

Compute:

N_p=1320,
2πf=376.992,
Φ_max=3.76e6 Mx =3.76 Wb.

So E_p_rms=1320 *376.992 * (3.76 /1.4142).

Compute step by step:

376.992 *3.76 ≈1,418.33,

1,418.33 /1.4142 ≈1,002.33,

Then 1320 *1,002.33 ≈1,322,000 V, same as before. So again, 1.322e6 V, which is way too high.

This suggests that either I'm making a mistake or the given flux is extremely high, which is unlikely. Therefore, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, perhaps the flux given is 3.76e6 maxwells, which is 3.76e6 Mx, which is 3.76 Wb. Let me see if that makes sense.

But even so, the induced EMF would be extremely high, which is not practical. So perhaps the problem is using a different approach, or I'm misapplying the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the flux is given in Weber, not maxwells, but that's unlikely because the question says maxwells.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the flux given is the maximum instantaneous flux, and the RMS flux is Φ_rms = Φ_max / sqrt(2). So let me compute E_p_rms using Φ_rms.

Φ_rms =3.76e6 Mx / sqrt(2) ≈3.76e6 /1.414 ≈2.657e6 Mx.

Then E_p_rms = N_p * 2πf Φ_rms.

So E_p_rms =1320 *2π*60 *2.657e6.

Compute:

2π*60≈376.992,

376.992 *2.657e6 ≈376.992 *2.657e6 ≈1.002e9,

1320 *1.002e9 ≈1.322e12 V. Again, way too high.

I must be missing something here. Perhaps the flux is given in a different way. Alternatively, maybe the question is asking for the induced EMF in volts, not considering the turns ratio.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the EMF using the turns ratio. The turns ratio K = N_p / N_s =1320 /46 ≈28.6957.

So the EMF in the secondary would be E_s = E_p / K.

But without knowing E_p, that's not helpful. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the EMF using the flux and the number of turns.

Wait, the induced EMF in the primary is E_p = N_p * dΦ/dt.

dΦ/dt at maximum is 2πf Φ_max.

So E_p_max = N_p *2πf Φ_max.

With Φ_max=3.76e6 Mx=3.76 Wb,

E_p_max=1320 *2π*60*3.76.

Compute:

2π*60≈376.992,

376.992 *3.76≈1,418.33,

1320 *1,418.33≈1,871,567 V, which is 1.871e6 V.

Similarly, E_s_max = N_s *2πf Φ_max =46 *376.992 *3.76 ≈46 *1,418.33≈65,112 V.

So E_p_max≈1.87e6 V, E_s_max≈6.51e4 V.

But looking at the options, part (c) in the options is (c) 13,200 volts, 460 volts (option H), or others.

Wait, none of the options match 1.87e6 V and 6.5e4 V. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the flux given is the RMS flux. Let me assume Φ_rms=3.76e6 Mx=3.76e6 Wb. Then, the maximum flux would be Φ_rms*sqrt(2)=5.32e6 Wb. But that would make the EMF even higher, which is not possible.

I'm stuck on part (c). Let me try to think differently. Perhaps the flux given is 3.76e6 maxwells, which is 3.76e6 Mx, which is 3.76 Wb. Then, the induced EMF would be E = N * 2πf Φ.

So E_p =1320 *2π*60*3.76e6 Mx.

Wait, but that would be 1320 *2π*60*3.76e6 Mx.

Wait, 2π*60=376.992,

376.992 *3.76e6 ≈1.418e9,

1320 *1.418e9 ≈1.87e12 V, which is impossible.

So perhaps the flux is given in a different unit. Maybe it's 3.76e6 Weber, but that's 3.76e12 Mx, which is way too high.

I think I'm stuck on part (c), but perhaps I should proceed to the options. Given that part (b) is 480 turns, which matches option H, and part (c) in option H is 13,200 V and 460 V, which might be the correct answers if I made a mistake in calculations.

Alternatively, perhaps part (c) is using a different approach, such as using the turns ratio to find the induced voltages.

Given N_p=1320, N_s=46,

The turns ratio K=1320/46≈28.6957.

If the primary voltage is E_p, then the secondary voltage is E_s=E_p / K.

But without knowing E_p, that's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps the flux is the same, so E_p= N_p *2πf Φ,

E_s= N_s *2πf Φ.

Thus, E_p=1320 *2π*60 *3.76e6 Mx,

But 3.76e6 Mx is 3.76e6 Wb, which is 3.76e6 V*s/turn.

So E_p=1320 *376.992 *3.76e6 ≈1320 *1.418e9≈1.87e12 V, which is way too high.

I think I'm stuck, so perhaps I should proceed with the given options and see which one matches part (b) as 480 turns, which is option H. So part (a) would be 1.8e5 Mx, part (b) 480 turns, and part (c) 13,200 V and 460 V, which matches option H.
</think>

To solve the problem, we analyze each part systematically:

### Part (a): Mutual Flux (φ_m)
The formula for mutual flux is:

\[
\phi_m = \frac{V_p \cdot N_p}{2 \pi f}
\]

Given:
- \( V_p = 2300 \, \text{V} \)
- \( N_p = 4800 \, \text{turns} \)
- \( f = 60 \, \text{Hz} \)

Substituting the values:

\[
\phi_m = \frac{2300 \cdot 4800}{2 \pi \cdot 60} = \frac{11,040,000}{376.992} \approx 29,283 \, \text{Mx}
\]

However, the options for (a) are in the \(10^5 \, \text{Mx}\) range. After re-evaluating, it appears there might be a discrepancy in the interpretation or calculation, but no exact match is found. Proceeding to Part (b) for further analysis.

### Part (b): Number of Turns in Secondary Winding
The turns ratio is given by:

\[
\frac{V_p}{V_s} = \frac{N_p}{N_s} \implies N_s = \frac{V_s \cdot N_p}{V_p}
\]

Given:
- \( V_p = 2300 \, \text{V} \)
- \( V_s = 230 \, \text{V} \)
- \( N_p = 4800 \, \text{turns} \)

Substituting the values:

\[
N_s = \frac{230 \cdot 4800}{2300} = 480 \, \text{turns}
\]

This matches **Option H** for part (b).

### Part (c): Maximum Flux and Induced Voltages
Given:
- \( N_p = 1320 \, \text{turns} \)
- \( N_s = 46 \, \text{turns} \)
- \( \phi_{\text{max}} = 3.76 \times 10^6 \, \text{Mx} \)

The maximum induced EMF in the primary is:

\[
E_p = N_p \cdot \frac{d\phi}{dt} = N_p \cdot 2 \pi f \cdot \phi_{\text{max}}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
E_p = 1320 \cdot 2 \pi \cdot 60 \cdot 3.76 \times 10^6 \approx 1.87 \times 10^6 \, \text{V}
\]

For the secondary:

\[
E_s = \frac{E_p \cdot N_s}{N_p} = \frac{1.87 \times 10^6 \cdot 46}{1320} \approx 65,112 \, \text{V}
\]

However, the options for (c) suggest much lower voltages. This discrepancy suggests a possible error in interpretation or units. Based on the given options and the match in Part (b), **Option H** is selected.

### Final Answer:
H
