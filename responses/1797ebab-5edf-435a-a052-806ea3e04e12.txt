Question:

A state has recently enacted a statute prohibiting the sale of computer printer ink cartridges in plastic bags. In accordance with the new law, all ink cartridges within the state must be sold in paper cartons that are recyclable. Before the passage of the law, approximately 28% of all ink cartridges used in the state was packaged in plastic bags. Of that total, 75% of the ink cartridges was packaged outside the state, while 25% was packaged by companies in-state. The legislature passed the bill at the strong urging of the paper industry. It was estimated that one paper company alone spent over $5,000,000 in its lobbying campaign for the passage of the bill. Ironically, the new law even received strong support from environmentalists who believed that recyclable paper would help prevent littering. Assume that the state Supreme Court adjudges the law to be unconstitutional on the grounds that it violates the contracts clauses of both the federal and the state Constitutions. The contracts clause of the state Constitution is similar to the one in the federal Constitution. The court so held because, in its judgment, the statute retroactively impairs the ability of plastic bag packagers to honor their existing contracts for the sale of ink cartridges packaged in plastic bags. The state attorney general now seeks review of this decision in the U. S. Supreme Court. How should the U. S. Supreme Court rule on this case?

Options:

A: Refuse to review this case on the merits because there is an adequate and independent state ground for the decision rendered below.
B: Affirm the decision on the merits with respect to the federal constitutional issue, but reverse the decision with respect to the state constitutional issue.
C: Reverse the decision on the merits with respect to the state constitutional issue because the federal constitutional holding rendered below makes such a state constitutional decision unnecessary.
D: Refuse to review the case because the state Supreme Court's decision does not conflict with any federal law or constitutional provision.
E: Affirm the decision on the merits with respect to the federal constitutional issue and abstain from reviewing the state constitutional issue.
F: Reverse the decision because the law does not retroactively impair the ability of plastic bag packagers to honor their existing contracts for the sale of ink cartridges packaged in plastic bags.
G: Affirm the decision on the merits with respect to the state constitutional issue and abstain from reviewing the federal constitutional issue.
H: Affirm the decision on the merits with respect to both the federal and state constitutional issues because the state constitution must substantially conform with the federal constitution on this issue.
I: Reverse the decision on the grounds that the state law does not violate the contracts clause of the federal Constitution.
J: Reverse the decision because the state law is a reasonable regulation of commerce and does not violate the contracts clauses of the federal and state constitutions.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how the U.S. Supreme Court would rule in this case. Let me start by breaking down the problem.

The state passed a law that prohibits selling ink cartridges in plastic bags and requires them to be sold in recyclable paper cartons. Before the law, 28% of ink cartridges were in plastic bags. Out of that, 75% were packaged outside the state, and 25% by in-state companies. The law was supported by the paper industry, particularly one company that spent a lot on lobbying. Environmentalists also supported it because they thought paper was recyclable and would help prevent litter.

The state Supreme Court found the law unconstitutional because it violated the contracts clause of both federal and state Constitutions. They said the law retroactively impairs the ability of plastic bag packagers to honor their existing contracts. Now, the attorney general is asking the U.S. Supreme Court to review this decision.

I need to determine how the U.S. Supreme Court should rule. The options are from A to J.

First, I should recall what the contracts clause says. The contracts clause in the U.S. Constitution prohibits states from passing laws that impair the obligation of contracts. So, if a state law retroactively invalidates existing contracts, it might be unconstitutional under the contracts clause.

In this case, the state law requires that ink cartridges be sold in paper bags, not plastic. Before the law, some contracts were in place for plastic packaging. The state law would require those contracts to be honored in a different way, maybe even making the plastic packaging illegal. So, the state Supreme Court said this impairs existing contracts, which is likely a valid concern under the contracts clause.

But wait, the state's law is about packaging, which is more of a regulation of commerce. However, the contracts clause applies if the law impairs existing contractual obligations. So, if the law makes it impossible for packagers to fulfill their contracts using plastic, that could be a problem.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A says the U.S. Supreme Court should refuse to review because there's an adequate state ground. But the state's decision was based on both federal and state constitutions. If the federal issue is present, the Court might still consider it.

Option B suggests affirming the federal part but reversing the state part. That might make sense if the federal issue was correctly decided but the state's own constitution doesn't have the same problem.

Option C says reverse the state issue because the federal holding makes it unnecessary. Wait, if the Supreme Court agrees with the state court on the federal issue, then the state's decision on their constitution might not be necessary. But the options here are about how the Court would rule.

Option D says refuse to review because no conflict with federal law. But the state's decision is about a federal constitutional issue, so this probably isn't right.

Option E affirms federal and abstains on state. That could be possible if the federal issue is resolved, but the state's own constitution is separate.

Option F reverses because the law doesn't impair contracts. That would mean the state court was wrong, but I'm not sure if the law definitely doesn't impair contracts.

Option G affirms the state issue and abstains on federal. That seems unlikely because the state's decision was based on both constitutions, and the U.S. Court would need to address the federal issue.

Option H affirms both because the state must conform. But the state's constitution can be more restrictive, so this might not be correct.

Option I reverses because the law doesn't violate the federal contracts clause. So, if the Court finds the law doesn't impair contracts, then they'd reverse.

Option J reverses because the law is a reasonable regulation. So, the law is upheld under the commerce clause, perhaps, but I'm not sure how that interacts with the contracts clause.

Wait, the key here is whether the state law retroactively impairs contracts. If the law applies only prospectively, it wouldn't impair existing contracts. But in this case, the law is applied retroactively. So, any existing contracts that require plastic packaging would be impaired.

Under the contracts clause, the state must have a substantial reason to justify impairing contracts. Here, the reason is environmental benefits, which is a legitimate concern. But courts are usually strict about retroactive laws.

The Supreme Court might look into whether the state's law is a reasonable exercise of police power. However, if the law is applied retroactively, it's more likely to be unconstitutional.

So, if the state Supreme Court found it unconstitutional under both constitutions, the U.S. Supreme Court might agree that the federal contracts clause is violated. But looking at the options, the options are about how the Court would rule on the case.

Wait, the question is about the U.S. Supreme Court's review of the state Supreme Court's decision. The state court ruled that the law is unconstitutional on contracts clause grounds. So, the U.S. Court has to decide whether to agree or disagree.

If the U.S. Court agrees that the law violates the federal contracts clause, they would affirm the state court's decision on that point. But the state court also ruled on the state constitution, which is similar. The U.S. Court would only address the federal issue, unless the state's decision was based on an independent state ground.

But in this case, the state's decision was based on both constitutions, so the U.S. Court could review the federal issue. If they agree, they would affirm the state court's decision on the federal part. But they might not need to decide on the state constitutional issue because the federal issue is sufficient.

Looking at the options, option E says affirm the federal issue and abstain on the state. That makes sense because the U.S. Court would decide the federal question, and the state's own constitutional issue is separate.

Alternatively, option H says affirm both because the state must conform. But that's not necessarily the case; the state can have its own constitution, but here the issue is about the federal clause.

Wait, another angle: the state's law affects both in-state and out-of-state packagers. The 75% packaged outside the state would be subject to the commerce clause analysis. But the contracts clause issue is about whether the law impairs contracts.

If the state's law is applied to both in-state and out-of-state contracts, it could be that the state doesn't have the power to impair contracts with out-of-state parties. But the state can regulate commerce, but not impair contracts in a way that unduly burdens interstate commerce.

Wait, but the question is about the contracts clause, not the commerce clause. So, the issue is whether the state can pass a law that impairs existing contracts, regardless of interstate commerce implications.

In this case, the law is a present law that affects future sales, but if it's applied retroactively, it could impair existing contracts. The state's reasoning is about environmental benefits, which is a substantial interest, but the impairment must be reasonable and necessary.

The Supreme Court has held that a state may not impair contracts without a substantial reason. For example, in Home Building & Loan Assn. v. Blaisdell, the Court upheld a state law that temporarily stayed mortgage foreclosures during the Great Depression, finding it was a reasonable exercise of police power to prevent loss of homes. However, that was a prospective application.

In this case, the law is applied retroactively, which makes it more likely to be unconstitutional. So, the state Supreme Court correctly found it unconstitutional. Therefore, the U.S. Supreme Court would affirm the decision on the federal constitutional issue.

But the options also mention the state constitutional issue. The state's decision was based on both constitutions. If the U.S. Court affirms the federal part, they might not need to address the state issue because the state's decision was on independent grounds. Alternatively, the state's decision could be upheld on federal grounds, making the state constitutional issue moot.

Looking at the options again:

Option E: Affirm federal, abstain on state.

Option H: Affirm both because state must conform.

But the state's constitution is similar to the federal, but not necessarily identical. However, the Supreme Court might not need to decide the state issue if the federal issue is resolved. So, if the state's decision was based on both, but the federal issue is sufficient, the U.S. Court could affirm on federal and not address the state.

Therefore, the correct answer would be E: Affirm the decision on the merits with respect to the federal constitutional issue and abstain from reviewing the state constitutional issue.

Wait, but another angle: the state's law is a regulation of commerce. The contracts clause applies to state laws, but the commerce clause could also be implicated if it's a burden on interstate commerce. However, the question is about the contracts clause, not the commerce clause. So, the U.S. Court would focus on whether the state law impairs contracts.

If the state's law does impair contracts, the U.S. Court would affirm the state court's decision on the federal contracts clause. But the options don't have that. Option I suggests reversing because the law doesn't violate the contracts clause. But if the law does impair contracts, then the state was correct.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The state Supreme Court found the law unconstitutional on contracts clause grounds, both federal and state. The U.S. Supreme Court would decide whether the law violates the federal contracts clause.

If the U.S. Court agrees, they would affirm on the federal issue. The state's decision on their own constitution is separate, so the U.S. Court might not need to address it, thus affirming the federal part and abstaining on the state.

So, the answer is E.
</think>

The U.S. Supreme Court should affirm the state Supreme Court's decision on the federal constitutional issue because the state law retroactively impairs existing contracts, violating the federal contracts clause. The state's decision was based on both federal and state constitutions, but the U.S. Supreme Court's review focuses on the federal issue. Therefore, the Court affirms the federal holding and abstains from addressing the state constitutional issue, as the federal decision is sufficient.
