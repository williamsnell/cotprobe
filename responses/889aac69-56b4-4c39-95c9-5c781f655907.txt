Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.

The reaction given is C₂H₄O → CH₄ + CO. It's a first-order reaction with a specific rate constant of 0.0123 min⁻¹ at 415°C. The question is asking what percent of the original C₂H₄O will be decomposed after heating at that temperature for one hour.

Hmm, right, so first-order reactions. I remember that the formula for the concentration remaining after time t is [A] = [A]₀ * e^(-kt). But wait, the question is about the percent decomposed, not the remaining. So I need to find how much has reacted, which would be 100% minus the remaining percentage.

Let me jot down what I know:
- Rate constant, k = 0.0123 min⁻¹
- Time, t = 1 hour. Oh, wait, I need to convert that into minutes because the units don't match. One hour is 60 minutes. So t = 60 min.

Now, plug these into the first-order formula. The formula for the remaining amount is [A] = [A]₀ * e^(-kt). So the remaining percent is ( [A] / [A]₀ ) * 100%. The decomposed percent would be 100% minus that.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, the problem asks for the percent decomposed, which is the amount that has reacted. So if X is the decomposed fraction, then X = 1 - (e^(-kt)). Because [A] is what's left, so the decomposed is 1 minus that fraction.

So let me compute e^(-kt). Let's calculate kt first. 0.0123 min⁻¹ * 60 min = 0.738.

So e^(-0.738). I need to calculate that. I remember that e^-0.7 is about 0.4966 (since ln(0.5) is about -0.693, so e^-0.7 is a bit less than 0.5). Let me get a more precise value.

Alternatively, I can use a calculator step by step. Let's see: 0.738. Let's compute e^-0.738.

Wait, using a calculator would be easier, but since I don't have one, I can approximate. Let me think. I know that e^0.7 is approximately 2.0138, so e^-0.7 is 1/2.0138 ≈ 0.4966. But 0.738 is a bit more than 0.7, so e^-0.738 should be a bit less than 0.4966. Maybe around 0.477?

Wait, another approach. Maybe I can use the Taylor series expansion for e^x. But that's time-consuming. Alternatively, I can use known values. Let me think: e^-0.6 is about 0.5488, e^-0.7 is about 0.4966, e^-0.8 is about 0.4493. So 0.738 is between 0.7 and 0.8. Let's see, 0.738 is 0.7 + 0.038. So let's linearly interpolate between 0.7 (0.4966) and 0.8 (0.4493).

The difference between 0.7 and 0.8 is 0.1. The value at 0.738 is 0.038 above 0.7. So the fraction would be (0.038/0.1) = 0.38. The change in e from 0.7 to 0.8 is 0.4966 - 0.4493 = 0.0473. So subtract 0.0473 * 0.38 from 0.4966.

0.0473 * 0.38 = approximately 0.018. So e^-0.738 ≈ 0.4966 - 0.018 = 0.4786. So about 0.4786, or 47.86%.

Wait, but wait, that's the remaining amount. So the percent decomposed is 100% - 47.86% = 52.14%.

Looking at the options, option A is 52.1%. That seems close.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculation because I might have made a mistake in the interpolation. Alternatively, perhaps I should use a more accurate method.

Wait another approach: I can use the formula for first-order reactions and plug in the numbers precisely.

So, kt = 0.0123 * 60 = 0.738.

Compute e^(-0.738). Let me see, using a calculator:

e^0.738 is approximately 2.093 (since e^0.7 is ~2.0138, e^0.038 is about 1.0388, so 2.0138 * 1.0388 ≈ 2.093). So e^-0.738 is 1/2.093 ≈ 0.4778, or 47.78%. So the remaining is about 47.78%, so decomposed is 100 - 47.78 = 52.22%. So approximately 52.2%, which aligns with option A: 52.1%.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any calculation mistakes. Let me recheck the multiplication for kt.

k is 0.0123 per minute. Time is 60 minutes. So 0.0123 * 60 = 0.738. Correct.

Now, e^-0.738. I think my estimation of around 0.4778 is accurate enough. So the remaining is about 47.78%, so decomposed is 52.22%, which would round to 52.2%. The closest option is A: 52.1%.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute e^-0.738 more accurately. Let's try using more precise methods.

We can use the Taylor series expansion for e^x around x=0. But since 0.738 is a bit large, the approximation might not be great, but let's try.

The Taylor series for e^x is 1 + x + x²/2! + x³/3! + x⁴/4! + ... So for x = -0.738,

e^-0.738 = 1 - 0.738 + (0.738²)/2 - (0.738³)/6 + (0.738⁴)/24 - ... 

Calculating each term:

Term 0: 1

Term 1: -0.738

Term 2: (0.738)^2 = 0.544. Divided by 2: 0.272 → +0.272

Term 3: (0.738)^3 ≈ 0.738 * 0.544 ≈ 0.401. Divided by 6: ≈ 0.0668 → -0.0668

Term 4: (0.738)^4 ≈ 0.401 * 0.738 ≈ 0.295. Divided by 24: ≈ 0.0123 → +0.0123

Term 5: (0.738)^5 ≈ 0.295 * 0.738 ≈ 0.217. Divided by 120: ≈ 0.00181 → -0.00181

Term 6: (0.738)^6 ≈ 0.217 * 0.738 ≈ 0.160. Divided by 720: ≈ 0.000222 → +0.000222

Adding up these terms:

1 -0.738 = 0.262

+0.272 → 0.534

-0.0668 → 0.4672

+0.0123 → 0.4795

-0.00181 → 0.4777

+0.000222 → 0.4779

So up to the sixth term, we have approximately 0.4779. The actual value is around 0.4778, so this approximation is pretty close. So e^-0.738 ≈ 0.4778, so 47.78% remaining, meaning 52.22% decomposed.

Looking at the options, the closest is A: 52.1%.

Wait, but another approach: perhaps using a calculator more precisely. Let me think. Alternatively, maybe I can use the natural logarithm properties. But I think the approximation is sufficient.

So the answer should be A: 52.1%.

To determine the percentage of C₂H₄O decomposed after 1 hour at 415°C, we use the first-order reaction formula:

\[
[A] = [A]_0 \cdot e^{-kt}
\]

Given:
- \( k = 0.0123 \, \text{min}^{-1} \)
- \( t = 60 \, \text{min} \)

First, calculate \( kt \):
\[
kt = 0.0123 \cdot 60 = 0.738
\]

Next, compute \( e^{-0.738} \). Using approximations:
\[
e^{-0.738} \approx 0.4778
\]

The remaining percentage of C₂H₄O is:
\[
\text{Remaining} = 0.4778 \cdot 100\% = 47.78\%
\]

The decomposed percentage is:
\[
\text{Decomposed} = 100\% - 47.78\% = 52.22\%
\]

The closest option is **52.1%**.
