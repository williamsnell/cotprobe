Alright, so I need to figure out how much Steven Moore has to pay each month for his new car. Let me start by understanding the problem.

He bought the car for $3,462.20, and he wants to pay it off in 35 months. I think this is a loan scenario where he's going to make equal monthly payments. So, I need to calculate the monthly payment amount.

Hmm, I remember there's a formula for calculating the monthly payment on a loan, which is the Present Value of an Annuity. The formula is PMT = PV * [i(1+i)^n]/[(1+i)^n -1]. Where PV is the present value, i is the monthly interest rate, and n is the number of payments.

Wait, but the problem doesn't specify the interest rate. Oh wait, maybe I'm missing something. Oh, wait, I think the question is expecting a simple calculation without considering interest, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the question assumes a zero interest rate, but that seems unlikely because that would make the monthly payments just the principal divided by the number of months.

Wait, let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the total amount he'll pay, including taxes and fees, but perhaps it's just a simple division. So if he's paying $3,462 over 35 months, then each month's payment would be $3,462 / 35.

Let me calculate that. 35 times 99 is 3465, which is just a bit higher than 3462. So 3462 /35 is approximately 99 (since 99 *35=3465, which is 3 more than 3462, so 3462 is 3465-3, so 99 - (3/35)= approximately 99 -0.085=98.914. So about $98.91 per month.

Looking at the options, E is $98.92, which is very close. But wait, wait. I think I might have made a mistake here. Because if the question is about a loan with a certain interest rate, those payments would be higher, but without knowing the interest rate, we can't apply the actual formula. Alternatively, maybe the question is considering a simple interest calculation, but that's not standard for loans.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the question is a straightforward division because the interest rate isn't given, but that might not be the case. Let me re-examine the problem statement. It says he purchased the car for $3,462.20 including taxes and all other charges. He wants to pay it in 35 months. So, the principal is $3,462, and he's going to pay it over 35 months.

Wait, but the question is about the monthly payments. Without knowing the interest rate, we can't calculate the exact payment. Oh wait, maybe the question is a trick question, and the correct payment is just the principal divided by the number of months, which would be $3462 /35 = approximately $98.91. So that would match option E: $98.92.

But wait, I'm not sure if the question implies that there's any interest. Because if there's no interest, the payment would just be the principal divided by the number of months. But the question doesn't mention interest, so perhaps it's just a flat rate or something else. Hmm, I'm a bit confused now.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is expecting to use the simple interest formula. The simple interest formula is I = P * r * t, where I is interest, P principal, r rate, t time. But again, without the interest rate, we can't calculate the exact amount. So that approach isn't helpful here.

Wait, another thought: sometimes in finance, when someone says they're paying a certain amount each month, it's the present value of those payments, which would involve the time value of money. But without knowing the discount rate, that's difficult. But since the question gives four options and one of them is just over $98.92, which is the result of $3462 /35, I think that's the intended approach.

So, the correct monthly payment would be approximately $98.91, which is option E: $98.92.

The correct calculation assumes the monthly payment is the principal divided by the number of months, as the interest rate is not provided and the question doesn't specify a more complex calculation. 

Answer: E: $98.92
