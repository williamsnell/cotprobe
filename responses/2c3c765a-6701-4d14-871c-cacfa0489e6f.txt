Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here about marketing methods. The question is asking which method is very effective at delivering messages to target audiences because it allows for explanation in a way that most other media can't. The options are A through J, with each being a different marketing approach.

First, I need to understand what each option entails. Let's go through them one by one.

Option A: Broadcast. That usually refers to mass media like TV, radio, or maybe even traditional advertising that reaches a broad audience. But broadcast might not be as targeted as some other methods, and it's more about reaching a wide audience rather than a specific group.

Option B: Social Media. Social media is a big one these days. It allows for targeted advertising because you can use algorithms to reach specific demographics, interests, and behaviors. Plus, platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter let you create detailed audience segments. But does it allow for detailed explanation? Well, social media can be visual and have text, but maybe it's limited in how much you can explain compared to other methods.

Option C: Direct Mail. This is physical mail sent directly to people's homes or businesses. Direct mail is known for being very targeted because you can choose specific lists of people based on demographics, purchasing behavior, etc. The advantage here is that you can include detailed information, maybe even a full explanation of a product or service. But it's a physical medium, so it's more tangible but perhaps slower in delivery and less immediate than digital methods.

Option D: Guerrilla Marketing. This is a low-cost, high-impact approach, often using unconventional methods like stickers, chalk art, or other creative tactics. It's good for creating buzz but might not be as effective in delivering detailed messages because it's more about grabbing attention quickly rather than explaining things thoroughly.

Option E: Digital. Digital marketing is a broad category that includes things like websites, social media, email, etc. While digital is great for reaching a wide audience and can be targeted, the question is asking about the ability to explain messages. Digital might offer more space for explanation than traditional media, but it's a broad term, so maybe not the best answer.

Option F: Email Marketing. Email allows for sending detailed messages directly to people's inboxes. You can include links, images, and a lot of content. It's very targeted because you can segment your email list based on various criteria. This seems like a strong candidate because emails can be personalized and provide in-depth information, which might be more than other media can offer.

Option G: Word-of-Mouth. This is a personal recommendation from one person to another. It's very effective because it's trusted, but it's not really a method you can control or scale easily. Plus, it's more about spreading the message rather than explaining it in detail.

Option H: Outdoor. Billboards, posters, etc. These are good for grabbing attention in public spaces but are limited in how much they can explain. They usually have short messages because of space constraints. So they're more about awareness than detailed explanation.

Option I: Print. This includes magazines, newspapers, flyers, etc. Print media can provide detailed information, but it's not as interactive or immediate as digital methods. It's also subject to the physical constraints of the medium, like page space. Plus, print has a slower reach compared to digital.

Option J: Event Marketing. This involves hosting or participating in events to promote a product or service. It allows for face-to-face interaction, which can be great for detailed explanations. You can demonstrate products, answer questions, and provide in-depth information. However, events can be expensive and time-consuming to organize, and their reach might be limited to those who attend the event.

Now, the question is about delivering messages with detailed explanations. So I need to think which method allows for that in a way others can't.

Email marketing (F) seems like a good fit because emails can be lengthy and detailed, allowing for thorough explanations. They can include links to more information, videos, images, etc. Plus, they can be targeted to specific segments, making the message more relevant.

Direct mail (C) also allows for detailed explanations, as you can include brochures, pamphlets, or letters with a lot of information. However, it's a physical medium, which might be less efficient than digital methods in terms of speed and reach.

Guerrilla marketing (D) and outdoor (H) are probably not as good for detailed messages because of their brevity. Broadcast (A) and print (I) can reach a wide audience but might not be as targeted or detailed as email or direct mail.

Word-of-mouth (G) is effective but not a method you can control for detailed messaging. Event marketing (J) is good for face-to-face explanations but limited in reach.

Digital (E) is broad, so while it includes email, it's too general. Social media (B) can be detailed but might not allow for as much depth as email or direct mail.

Putting it all together, email marketing seems to be the best option because it's highly targeted and allows for detailed explanations. It's a direct method where you can send a message with all the necessary information to the right people.
