Okay, so I have this microscopy problem to solve. Let me start by trying to understand what the question is asking. 

The question is about a compound microscope, which I remember has two main components: the objective lens and the eyepiece. The objective forms an image, and then the eyepiece magnifies that image. The problem gives me some specific details, and I need to find the total magnification.

Let me jot down the given information:

- Objective focal length, f_obj = 3 mm. Wait, that's a really short focal length. I'm used to seeing objectives with much longer focal lengths, but maybe it's correct.
- The intermediary image formed by the objective is 160 mm beyond the second focal plane of the objective. Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on what that means. I think the second focal plane is related to where the image is formed when the object is placed at the first focal plane. Oh wait, in microscopy, when the object is placed at the first focal plane (f1) of the objective, the image is formed at the second focal plane (f2) which is at a distance determined by the objective's properties. But wait, the problem says the image is 160 mm beyond the second focal plane. So the image distance (v) is f2 + 160 mm? Or is f2 the image distance when the object is at f1?

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The formula for a microscope's magnification involves the objective and the eyepiece. The total magnification M is given by M = M_obj * M_eyepiece, where M_obj is the magnification of the objective, and M_eyepiece is the magnification of the eyepiece.

The eyepiece magnification is given as 20x when the eye is focused at infinity. So M_eyepiece is 20x. That part seems straightforward.

Now, the objective magnification. I recall that the magnification of the objective is given by M_obj = - (v/u), where v is the image distance and u is the object distance. But in microscopy, when the object is placed at the first focal plane, the image is formed at the second focal plane. The magnification in that case is given by M_obj = (25 cm) / f_obj, but wait, that's for when the image is at infinity. Or is it (25 cm) / f_obj when the image is at the second focal plane?

Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Let me get the formula right. The magnification of the objective when the image is at the second focal plane (which is 25 cm from the eyepiece, but maybe I'm complicating it). Let me think about the formula again.

The objective forms an image which is then viewed by the eyepiece. The total magnification for the microscope is given by M = (v/u) * (D / f_eyepiece), where D is 25 cm (the near point of the eye). Alternatively, another formula I remember is M = (v/u) * (D / f_eyepiece) = (v/u) * (eyepiece magnification). Since the eyepiece magnification here is 20x, I can express M as M_obj * 20.

But wait, M_obj is (v/u) for the objective. So I need to find v and u for the objective.

Wait, but in the problem, it says the image is formed 160 mm beyond the second focal plane. So the image distance (v) is f_obj2 + 160 mm. But what's the position of the second focal plane?

Wait, the second focal plane of the objective is at a distance given by the formula for the image when the object is at the first focal plane (u = f_obj). So when u = f_obj, the image is formed at v = f_obj * (1 + (f_obj / u)). Wait, no, that's not right. Let me recall the lens formula: 1/f = 1/u + 1/v.

If u = f_obj, then 1/f = 1/f + 1/v → 1/v = 0 → v approaches infinity. Hmm, that's not right because when the object is at the first focal plane, the image should be at infinity for a microscope? Wait, maybe I'm getting the setup wrong.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the image distance beyond the second focal plane. The problem states that the image is 160 mm beyond the second focal plane. So the image distance (v) is equal to the focal length of the objective (f_obj) plus 160 mm? Or perhaps the second focal plane is at a certain position, and the image is 160 mm beyond that.

Wait, maybe the second focal plane is at a distance determined by another factor. Let me think: when the object is placed at the first focal plane of the objective (u = f_obj), the image is formed at the second focal plane, which is at a distance v = infinity. But that can't be right because that would mean the image is at infinity, which wouldn't make sense for microscopy. Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up things. Maybe for a microscope, the objective is designed such that when the object is at the first focal plane, the image is formed at the second focal plane, which is at a specific distance, not necessarily infinity.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula for the image distance when the object is placed at the first focal plane. Let me think: using the lens formula 1/f = 1/u + 1/v. If u = f, then 1/f = 1/f + 1/v → 0 = 1/v → v approaches infinity. So that's correct. But that would mean the image is at infinity when the object is at the first focal plane. But in microscopy, the image formed by the objective is then viewed by the eyepiece, which acts as a magnifier. So perhaps the image is at the focal point of the eyepiece, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try a different approach. The problem states that the image is 160 mm beyond the second focal plane of the objective. So the image distance (v) is f_obj + 160 mm. If f_obj is 3 mm, then v = 3 mm + 160 mm = 163 mm. But that seems very close, maybe in centimeters instead? Oh wait, no, 3 mm is 3 mm, so 163 mm is 163 mm.

Wait, but that would make the image distance 163 mm. Now, using the lens formula, 1/f = 1/u + 1/v → 1/3 = 1/u + 1/163. Let me solve for u.

1/u = 1/3 - 1/163 ≈ (163 - 3)/(3*163) = 160/(489) ≈ 0.3271. So u ≈ 1/0.3271 ≈ 3.058 mm. So the object is placed approximately 3.058 mm from the objective. But wait, the object is supposed to be at the first focal plane, which is at u = f_obj = 3 mm. So perhaps the image being 160 mm beyond the second focal plane is the image distance beyond the second focal plane, so the total image distance (v) is f_obj (position of the second focal plane) plus 160 mm. Wait, but I thought the second focal plane is at v = infinity when the object is at u = f_obj. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting the setup wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the image being formed 160 mm beyond the second focal plane refers to the image distance being 160 mm longer than the second focal plane's position. So if the second focal plane is at a certain position, the image is 160 mm beyond that. Let me think: the second focal plane is at a distance from the objective equal to the focal length, so f_obj = 3 mm. So the image distance is v = 3 mm + 160 mm = 163 mm. So now, using the lens formula, 1/f = 1/u + 1/v → 1/3 = 1/u + 1/163 → 1/u = 1/3 - 1/163 ≈ (163 -3)/(3*163) = 160/(489) ≈ 0.3271 → u ≈ 3.058 mm.

Wait, but if the object is placed at u = 3 mm, which is f_obj, then the image would be at v = infinity. But in this case, the image is at 163 mm. So perhaps the object is placed a bit beyond the first focal plane, making the image form at a finite distance.

Wait, perhaps the key here is that the image is formed 160 mm beyond the second focal plane, but I'm not entirely sure how that translates into the image distance. Maybe I should think in terms of the magnification of the objective.

The magnification of the objective M_obj is given by M_obj = -v/u. Since the object is placed at u, and the image is at v, and the image is inverted, but the negative sign just indicates inversion, so the magnification's magnitude is v/u.

In microscopy, the magnification of the objective is often given by (v/u) when the object is at the first focal plane, but in that case, v approaches infinity, making the magnification very large. But in this problem, the image isn't at infinity but at 160 mm beyond the second focal plane.

Wait, perhaps the second focal plane is at a distance of f_obj from the objective. So the second focal plane is at v = f_obj = 3 mm. Then, the image is formed 160 mm beyond that, so v = 3 mm + 160 mm = 163 mm. So now, using the lens formula, 1/f = 1/u + 1/v → 1/3 = 1/u + 1/163 → 1/u = (163 -3)/(3*163) = 160/(489) → u ≈ 3.058 mm.

So the object is placed at u ≈ 3.058 mm, and the image is at v = 163 mm. So the magnification of the objective is M_obj = v/u ≈ 163 / 3.058 ≈ 53.26. So approximately 53.26 times.

Wait, but that seems a bit high for an objective magnification, but maybe it's correct. Alternatively, perhaps the formula for the objective magnification when the image is at a finite distance is different.

Wait, another formula I remember is that the magnification of the objective is M_obj = (v)/(u), but when the object is at the first focal plane, u = f_obj, and v approaches infinity, making M_obj very large. But in this case, the object isn't at u = f_obj, because the image is at v = 163 mm, so u is just a bit larger than f_obj.

Wait, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The problem says that the image is formed 160 mm beyond the second focal plane, so v = f_obj + 160 mm = 3 + 160 = 163 mm.

So using the lens formula, 1/f = 1/u + 1/v → 1/3 = 1/u + 1/163 → 1/u = 1/3 - 1/163 = (163 -3)/(3*163) = 160/(489) → u ≈ 3.058 mm.

So M_obj = v/u = 163 / 3.058 ≈ 53.26.

Then, the eyepiece magnification is 20x, so total magnification M = M_obj * M_eyepiece ≈ 53.26 * 20 ≈ 1065.2, which is approximately 1066x.

Looking at the options, option G is 1066. So the answer should be G: 1066.

The problem involves calculating the total magnification of a compound microscope. The objective has a focal length of 3 mm, and the image formed by the objective is 160 mm beyond the second focal plane. The eyepiece provides a magnification of 20x.

### Step 1: Determine the image distance (v)
The second focal plane is located at a distance equal to the focal length of the objective, \( f_{\text{obj}} = 3 \, \text{mm} \). Since the image is 160 mm beyond this plane, the total image distance is:

\[
v = f_{\text{obj}} + 160 \, \text{mm} = 3 \, \text{mm} + 160 \, \text{mm} = 163 \, \text{mm}.
\]

### Step 2: Use the lens formula to find the object distance (u)
The lens formula is:

\[
\frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{u} + \frac{1}{v}.
\]

Substituting \( f = 3 \, \text{mm} \) and \( v = 163 \, \text{mm} \):

\[
\frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{u} + \frac{1}{163}.
\]

Solving for \( \frac{1}{u} \):

\[
\frac{1}{u} = \frac{1}{3} - \frac{1}{163} = \frac{163 - 3}{3 \times 163} = \frac{160}{489}.
\]

Thus, the object distance is:

\[
u = \frac{489}{160} \approx 3.058 \, \text{mm}.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the magnification of the objective
The magnification of the objective is given by:

\[
M_{\text{obj}} = \frac{v}{u}.
\]

Substituting \( v = 163 \, \text{mm} \) and \( u \approx 3.058 \, \text{mm} \):

\[
M_{\text{obj}} = \frac{163}{3.058} \approx 53.26.
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the total magnification
The total magnification of the microscope is the product of the objective magnification and the eyepiece magnification:

\[
M_{\text{total}} = M_{\text{obj}} \times M_{\text{eyepiece}}.
\]

Given \( M_{\text{eyepiece}} = 20 \):

\[
M_{\text{total}} = 53.26 \times 20 \approx 1065.2 \approx 1066.
\]

### Final Answer:
The total magnification provided by the microscope is approximately **1066x**.
