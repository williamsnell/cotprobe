Question:

A widow owned an apartment building. Several years ago, a student, in a signed writing, entered a three-year lease agreement with the widow. The student agreed to pay $800 monthly rent for the third-floor apartment in the widow's building. The original three-year term had long since expired, but the student had continued to pay his rent, and the widow continued to accept it. If the widow had chosen to evict the student immediately upon the end of the three-year period, and before she had accepted the next rent check, the student's strongest argument to prevent eviction, if true, would have been that

Options:

A: the student had a right to stay as he had been residing there for more than three years.
B: the widow had not given the student requisitenotice for terminating a term of years.
C: the student had made improvements to the property, thus extending the leasehold.
D: the student had a verbal agreement with the widow to extend the lease.
E: the terms of the leasehold contract were binding on both parties.
F: the widow had accepted rent for the following month before the three-year period ended.
G: the student was protected from eviction due to his status as a student.
H: the widow had not clearly communicated the end of the lease term.
I: the widow had not given the student requisitenotice for terminating a periodic tenancy.
J: the leasehold contract was void ab initio.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about property law, specifically dealing with leases. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow.

The question is about a widow who owns an apartment building. A student signed a three-year lease with her, agreeing to pay $800 a month. The lease term has expired, but the student has kept paying rent, and the widow kept accepting it. Now, if the widow tried to evict the student right after the lease ended, before accepting the next rent check, what's the student's best argument against eviction?

I remember that when a lease term ends, the tenant can sometimes continue staying if the landlord doesn't explicitly terminate the lease. This might create what's called a periodic tenancy or a month-to-month lease. But I'm not entirely sure about the specifics.

Looking at the options:

A: The student has a right to stay because he's been there more than three years. I think a lease term doesn't automatically extend based on duration; it's about the lease terms. So maybe A isn't right.

B: The widow didn't give the required notice to terminate a term of years. Wait, the lease was a three-year term. If the original term is over, she needs to give notice if it's a periodic tenancy now. But I'm not sure if B is about the original term or the new periodic one.

C: The student improved the property, extending the lease. I don't think tenant improvements can extend a lease unless the lease says so. So probably not C.

D: They had a verbal agreement to extend. The original lease was written, but if they verbally agreed, that might create a new lease. But if the original term ended, and there's no written extension, a verbal might not be enforceable. I'm not certain.

E: The lease terms were binding. Well, yes, but once the term is over, the lease is done unless it's extended. So E might not prevent eviction.

F: The widow accepted rent for the following month before the lease ended. Hmm, that sounds like the lease was still in effect because she accepted rent after the term had ended, which might imply an extension. But wait, the question says she accepted the rent after the term ended but before she tried to evict. I'm a bit confused here. If she accepted rent after the lease ended, that could create a new periodic tenancy. But if she tried to evict before accepting the next check, then maybe F isn't applicable because she didn't accept it yet.

G: Student status protected. I don't think being a student gives any special protection unless there's specific law, which isn't mentioned here.

H: Widow didn't communicate the end. Maybe she didn't tell him the lease was ending, but the question doesn't say she did or didn't. It just says the term expired, and she accepted rent, so maybe H isn't the main issue.

I: Widow didn't give notice for terminating periodic tenancy. If the original lease ended and the tenant stayed, a periodic tenancy might start, and the landlord would need proper notice to end it. Since she tried to evict right after the term ended, before accepting the next rent, she might not have given the required notice yet. So I could be the right answer.

J: Lease was void from the start. That seems unlikely unless there were issues with the lease formation, which isn't mentioned here.

So putting it together: When a lease term ends, if the landlord doesn't give proper notice, the tenant might continue under a periodic tenancy. The required notice for terminating a periodic tenancy is usually 30 or 60 days, depending on the state. If the widow tried to evict immediately upon the lease ending, she might not have given the required notice yet, making the eviction improper. So the student's argument would be that the widow didn't give the necessary notice to terminate the periodic tenancy, which is option I.

The student's strongest argument would be that the widow did not provide the required notice to terminate the periodic tenancy that formed after the original lease expired. This is because, upon the lease ending, the continued acceptance of rent created a new periodic tenancy, and the widow needed to give proper notice before evicting. 

Answer: I
