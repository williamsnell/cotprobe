The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

A landlord was the owner of a two-story dwelling house and leased it completely furnished to a tenant for a 10-year period. Toward the end of the seventh year of the term, a violent storm blew off several of the roof shingles. The tenant noticed a leak through the roof where the shingles had blown off, but didn't make any repairs. A month later, a severe rain storm occurred and water leaked through the roof, causing damage to the valuable parquet floors in the two rooms below. In a subsequent proceeding by the landlord against the tenant to recover for the damage to the parquet floors resulting from the leak, liability would most likely be imposed upon

Options:

A: the landlord, because he failed to inspect the property after the storm
B: both the landlord and the tenant, because they both neglected their responsibilities in maintaining the property.
C: the tenant, because a tenant for years is obligated to make such ordinary repairs on the leased property.
D: the landlord, because he was under an implied obligation to keep the premises in a habitable condition.
E: the landlord, because he was under an affirmative obligation to deliver the premises in a reasonable state of repair.
F: the tenant, because he noticed the damage and failed to report it to the landlord
G: the tenant, because he is responsible for any damage that occurs during his lease period
H: the landlord, because of the contractual obligation under the lease to make all necessary repairs during the term of the lease.
I: the tenant, because he was negligent in maintaining the property
J: the landlord, because he didn't provide sufficient maintenance during the lease period

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this landlord-tenant question. Let me read through it again.

A landlord leased a two-story house completely furnished for 10 years. In the seventh year, a storm blew off some roof shingles. The tenant noticed the leak but didn't fix it. A month later, another storm caused water damage to the parquet floors. The landlord is suing the tenant for the damage. Who's liable?

Hmm, I remember that in lease agreements, there are different obligations. I think about whether the landlord or tenant is responsible for repairs. So, the lease was for 10 years, so it's a long-term lease. I think that in such cases, the tenant might have more responsibilities, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, the lease was "completely furnished." Does that change anything? Maybe the landlord is supposed to maintain the premises, but if it's furnished, maybe the tenant takes on more responsibility? Or is it the other way around?

The key here is the timing. The first storm happened towards the end of the seventh year. The tenant noticed the leak but didn't repair it. Then, a month later, another storm caused damage. So, the tenant had notice of the problem but didn't act.

I think about the concept of "tenant for years." I remember that a tenant for years is considered a lessee and has certain obligations. They might be responsible for maintaining the property, especially if the lease term is long. So, maybe the tenant is liable here because they didn't fix the leak after noticing it.

But wait, the landlord's obligations. I think landlords typically have to keep the premises in a habitable condition. But in this case, the problem was a leak that the tenant noticed. So, the landlord might not be liable if they weren't aware of the issue or if the tenant failed to address it.

Looking at the options, let's go through them one by one.

Option A: Landlord failed to inspect. But the tenant noticed the leak, so maybe the landlord wasn't required to inspect unless there's a specific clause. But I don't think the landlord is liable just for not inspecting; the tenant should have taken care.

Option B: Both parties. Hmm, maybe, but I'm not sure. If both were negligent, but perhaps the tenant's negligence is the main cause.

Option C: Tenant for years obligated to make ordinary repairs. That sounds familiar. Since it's a long lease, the tenant might be responsible for repairs. So, the tenant is liable because they didn't fix the leak, leading to damage.

Option D: Landlord's implied obligation to keep premises habitable. But the issue here is that the tenant noticed the leak. The landlord might not be liable if the tenant didn't report it and the tenant is responsible for repairs during the lease.

Option E: Landlord's obligation to deliver in a reasonable state. The initial delivery was probably fine, but the issue arose during the lease. So, maybe the landlord isn't liable for ongoing repairs unless the lease says so.

Option F: Tenant failed to report the damage. If the tenant is required to notify the landlord, then maybe the landlord should have fixed it. But I think in a tenant for years situation, the tenant usually handles repairs unless the landlord is contractually obligated.

Option H: Contractual obligation under lease. If the lease says the landlord must make repairs, then the landlord would be liable. But if the lease doesn't specify, then the tenant might be responsible. The question doesn't say anything about the lease terms regarding repairs, so I can't assume that.

Option I: Tenant negligent in maintaining. That's possible, but I'm not sure if it's the primary reason. It's more about the duty to repair.

Option J: Landlord's insufficient maintenance. Again, without specific lease terms, it's hard to say. But the tenant had notice.

So, considering all this, I think the tenant is liable because they didn't repair the known issue. The landlord's obligations are usually to provide a habitable unit at the start, but during the term, especially for a long lease, the tenant is responsible for maintenance. So, the answer should be C or I.

Wait, the options: C says tenant is obligated to make ordinary repairs. I says tenant was negligent. The difference is between a contractual obligation and negligence.

In a lease, the tenant's duty to repair is often contractual, not necessarily negligence unless they failed to act when they should have. So, if the lease requires the tenant to make repairs, then C applies. But if the landlord didn't specify, maybe it's negligence.

But the question says the lease was completely furnished. I think in such cases, the tenant is expected to maintain the premises, so they might have an obligation to repair. So, C seems correct because it's about the tenant's obligation under the lease.

Alternatively, D says the landlord's implied obligation to keep it habitable. But the tenant didn't report the issue, so maybe the landlord isn't liable because the tenant didn't inform them. Landlords are usually only liable for defects they know about or should know through inspections, but since the tenant noticed it, the landlord might not be responsible.

So, I think the correct answer is C: the tenant is liable because a tenant for years is obligated to make such ordinary repairs.

The correct answer is C: the tenant, because a tenant for years is obligated to make such ordinary repairs on the leased property.
