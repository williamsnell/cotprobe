Okay, so I have this question about nuclear reactions and changes in atomic numbers. Hmm, I remember from my chemistry class that when elements undergo alpha or beta decay, their atomic numbers change in specific ways. Let me try to think this through step by step.

The question says that a certain element emits one alpha particle and then its products emit two beta particles in succession. I need to find out how the atomic number of the resulting element changes.

First, I should recall what happens during alpha and beta decay. Alpha decay involves the emission of an alpha particle, which is a helium nucleusâ€”so it's made up of 2 protons and 2 neutrons. When an element emits an alpha particle, its atomic number decreases by 2 because it loses two protons. So if the original element has an atomic number Z, after alpha decay, it becomes Z-2.

After that, the product of the alpha decay emits two beta particles. Now, beta decay is a bit different. In beta minus decay, a neutron turns into a proton, an electron (beta particle), and an antineutrino. Each beta emission increases the atomic number by 1 because a neutron is converted into a proton. So if the element after alpha decay has an atomic number of Z-2, each beta decay will add 1 to that.

Since there are two beta emissions, the atomic number increases by 2. So the total change would be the initial change from alpha decay minus 2, and then plus 2 from the two beta decays. Let me write that down:

Initial atomic number: Z
After alpha decay: Z - 2
After first beta decay: (Z - 2) + 1 = Z - 1
After second beta decay: (Z - 1) + 1 = Z

Wait, so after both decays, the atomic number ends up back at Z? That means the net change is zero. So the atomic number doesn't change overall. 

Let me double-check. Alpha decay reduces Z by 2, then each beta adds 1. 2 betas add 2, so -2 +2 = 0. Yeah, that makes sense. So the resulting element has the same atomic number as the original element. 

Looking at the options, the change is zero, which is option J.

The element emits an alpha particle, decreasing its atomic number by 2. Subsequent beta emissions increase the atomic number by 1 each, resulting in a net change of zero. 

Answer: J
