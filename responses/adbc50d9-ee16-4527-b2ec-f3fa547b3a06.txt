Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem about a damped harmonic oscillator. The question is asking for the ratio of the frequency of the damped oscillator to its natural frequency after four cycles, when the amplitude drops to 1/e of its initial value. Hmm, I remember that damped oscillators have exponential decay in their amplitude over time. 

Let me think. The general equation for the amplitude of a damped harmonic oscillator as a function of time is A(t) = A0 * e^(-t/(2τ)), where τ is the time constant. But wait, I might have that equation a bit off. Alternatively, I've heard it expressed using the damping factor. Oh right, the amplitude decreases by a factor of 1/e every τ time units, where τ is the damping time. So the amplitude after time t is A(t) = A0 * e^(-t/τ), where τ is the time constant related to the damping.

But in this problem, they mention the amplitude drops to 1/e after four cycles. So first, I need to relate the time taken for four cycles to the exponential decay. Let me think: each cycle is a period T. So four cycles would be 4T. So the time t is 4T. 

So at that time, A(t) = A0 / e. Plugging into the amplitude equation: A0 / e = A0 * e^(-t/τ). Dividing both sides by A0, I get 1/e = e^(-4T/τ). Taking the natural logarithm of both sides, ln(1/e) = -4T/τ. That simplifies to -1 = -4T/τ. So τ = 4T. Oh wait, that can't be right because if τ is 4T, then the damping time is four times the period. Hmm, maybe I messed up the equation.

Wait, wait. Let me double-check. The general expression for amplitude in damped harmonic motion is A(t) = A0 * e^(-t/(2τ)), where τ is the time constant. Or is it 1/(2τ)? Oh wait, I think it's A(t) = A0 * e^(-t/τ), where τ is the time constant. But I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The damping is usually modeled by exponential decay, so perhaps τ is the time it takes for the amplitude to decrease by 1/e. So if A(t) = A0 * e^(-t/τ), then when t=τ, A= A0/e. So yes, τ is the time for the amplitude to drop by 1/e. 

So in this problem, after four cycles, which take time t=4T, the amplitude is A0 / e. So setting that equal:

A(t) = A0 * e^(-t/τ) = A0 / e.

Dividing both sides by A0:

e^(-t/τ) = 1/e.

Taking ln:

- t/τ = -1 → t/τ = 1 → τ = t = 4T.

So τ = 4T. But τ is also related to the damping coefficient. I think the damping time τ is related to the natural frequency ω0 and the damping coefficient γ. The damping coefficient γ is related to the natural frequency by τ = 1/(γ/2), or τ = 2/γ. Wait, the relationship between the damping coefficient γ and the natural frequency ω0 is that the damping ratio is ζ = γ/(2ω0). 

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me think step by step. The equation of motion for a damped harmonic oscillator is:

m d²x/dt² + γ dx/dt + kx = 0.

Dividing through by m, we get:

d²x/dt² + (γ/m) dx/dt + (k/m) x = 0.

Let me denote ω0² = k/m, so the natural frequency is ω0 = sqrt(k/m).

The damping coefficient is γ/m, which I'll call 2β, so γ = 2β m, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the damping coefficient is often written as γ, so the equation becomes:

d²x/dt² + (γ/m) x' + ω0² x = 0.

The characteristic equation is r² + (γ/m) r + ω0² = 0.

The roots are r = [ -γ/(2m) ± sqrt( (γ/(2m))² - ω0² ) ].

For underdamped motion, the roots are complex, and the solution is x(t) = e^(-γ t/(2m)) [ C1 cos(ω_d t) + C2 sin(ω_d t) ], where ω_d is the damped frequency.

So ω_d = sqrt(ω0² - (γ/(2m))² ).

But I think the amplitude decay is given by the exponential term, which is e^(-t/(2τ)), where τ is the time constant. So 1/(2τ) = γ/(2m) → τ = m/(γ).

Wait, no, because the exponential term is e^(-tτ'), where τ' is the time constant. So τ' = m/(γ) * 2, perhaps. Let me clarify. The exponential decay term is e^(-t/(2τ)), so to match that with the solution, we have 1/(2τ) = γ/(2m) → τ = m/(γ). Hmm, maybe I should check that.

Alternatively, the amplitude as a function of time is A(t) = A0 * e^(-t/(2τ)), where τ is the time constant. So the time for the amplitude to drop by 1/e is τ, as at t=τ, A = A0/e.

In this problem, the amplitude drops to 1/e after four cycles, so t=4T. So 4T = τ.

Now, the natural frequency is ω0 = 2π f0, where f0 is the natural frequency in Hz. The damped frequency is ω = ω_d = sqrt(ω0² - (γ/(2m))² ). But I'm not directly asked about the frequency, but the ratio of the damped frequency to the natural frequency, which is ω / ω0.

Wait, the question is the ratio of the damped oscillator's frequency to its natural frequency. But wait, in the damped oscillator, the frequency is ω_d. So the ratio is ω_d / ω0.

But I think I can find ω_d in terms of ω0 and τ. Let me see.

From τ = m/(γ). Because τ is the time constant, and earlier I had τ = m/(γ), as per the exponential term being e^(-t/(2τ)).

Wait, no, earlier I thought the exponential decay was e^(-t/τ), but perhaps I should be precise. Let me re-express the amplitude. The amplitude after time t is A(t) = A0 * e^(-t/(2τ)), where τ is the time constant related to damping. So in this case, when t=4T, A(t)=A0/e. So:

A0/e = A0 * e^(-4T/(2τ)).

Divide both sides by A0 and take reciprocal:

e = e^(2T/τ).

So 2T/τ = 1 → τ = 2T.

Wait, that's different from what I thought earlier. So τ is 2T. Because 4T/(2τ) equals 4T/(2*(2T))=4T/(4T)=1. So 4T/(2τ) is 1, so e^(-1) = 1/e.

So τ = 2T.

Now, τ is the time constant, which is m/(γ). Because from the exponential term e^(-t/(2τ)), the 2τ is the time to drop by 1/e, so τ is the time to drop by 1/sqrt(e), perhaps? Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me better relate τ to the damping coefficient.

In the solution, the amplitude is A(t) = A0 e^(-t/(2τ)). So the time to drop by 1/e is when e^(-t/(2τ)) = 1/e → t/(2τ) = 1 → t = 2τ. So if the amplitude drops to 1/e after t=2τ, then in this problem, it drops to 1/e after t=4T. So 4T = 2τ → τ=2T.

So τ=2T.

Now, τ is related to the damping coefficient γ and the natural frequency ω0. From the damping ratio, ζ = γ/(2ω0). Also, in underdamped systems, the time constant τ is given by τ = 1/(ζω0). Wait, let me think. I might be mixing different expressions.

Alternatively, the damping factor is gamma/(2m), and the time constant τ is 1/(gamma/(2m)) )= 2m/gamma. Hmm, I think I need to find the relation between τ and ω0.

Alternatively, since τ=2T, and T is the period of the oscillator. The period T of the natural oscillator is T0 = 2π/ω0. So T=2π/ω0.

But in the damped oscillator, the period is T_d = 2π/ω_d, where ω_d is the damped frequency. But the system is oscillating with frequency ω_d, which is less than ω0.

But the time for four cycles is 4T_d, because each cycle is T_d. Wait, no. Wait, the time taken for four cycles in the damped oscillator would be 4T_d. But in our problem, the time is 4T, where T is the period of the natural oscillator, which is 2π/ω0. So t=4*(2π/ω0) = 8π/ω0.

But earlier, we had t=4T = τ=2T. Wait, no, no, earlier I found that τ=2T, where T is the period of the natural oscillator, T0=2π/ω0. So τ=2*(2π/ω0)=4π/ω0.

But τ is also related to the damping coefficient. Let's relate τ to the damping coefficient γ.

From the amplitude equation, the exponential decay is e^(-t/(2τ)). So the time constant for decay is 2τ. Wait, perhaps not. Let me think: when t=2τ, then the amplitude is e^(-2τ/(2τ))=e^{-1} = 1/e. So the time constant for the amplitude to drop by 1/e is 2τ. So in our problem, the time is 4T, and that's the time when the amplitude drops by 1/e. So 4T = 2τ → τ=2T.

But wait, I'm getting myself confused. Let me try a different approach.

We have τ = 2T, where T is the natural period (2π/ω0). So τ = 2*(2π/ω0) =4π/ω0.

But τ is also related to the damping coefficient γ. From the damped harmonic oscillator, the time constant for the exponential decay is τ_decay = 1/(ζ ω0), where ζ is the damping ratio. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, the time constant τ is related to the damping coefficient γ by τ= m/(γ). Because the damping coefficient is γ, and the equation involves terms like (γ/m). So from τ = m/γ, and knowing that ζ= γ/(2ω0), we can write γ=2ζ ω0 m.

Wait, maybe that's getting somewhere. Let me write down the relations:

ζ = γ/(2ω0 m) ??? Wait, no. Let me correct. The damping coefficient is often denoted by γ, and the damping ratio is ζ = γ/(2ω0), where ω0 is the natural frequency. So ζ = γ/(2ω0).

So γ = 2 ζ ω0.

Now, the time constant τ is given by τ = m/(γ). Substituting γ from above, τ = m/(2 ζ ω0).

But earlier, we found that τ=4π/ω0. So:

m/(2 ζ ω0) = 4π/ω0.

Multiply both sides by ω0:

m/(2 ζ) =4π.

So m/(2 ζ) =4π → m =8 π ζ.

Hmm, not sure if that helps directly. Alternatively, perhaps I can find the ratio ω/ω0, where ω is the damped frequency.

The damped frequency is given by ω = ω0 sqrt(1 - ζ^2). Because in underdamped motion, the angular frequency is sqrt(ω0² - (γ/(2m))² ) = ω0 sqrt(1 - ζ^2).

Wait, ζ is the damping ratio, which is ζ = γ/(2ω0 m) ? No, wait. Let me clarify.

Wait, ζ is the damping ratio, defined as ζ = (γ)/(2ω0). So ζ = γ/(2ω0).

So from that, γ=2 ζ ω0.

The damped frequency is ω = ω0 sqrt(1 - ζ^2).

So the ratio ω/ω0 is sqrt(1 - ζ^2).

Our goal is to find this ratio.

Now, we need to find ζ in terms of the given information.

We know that after t=4T, where T is the natural period T=2π/ω0, the amplitude is A0/e. So t=4*(2π/ω0) =8π/ω0.

At this time, the amplitude is A(t)=A0 e^(-t/(2τ)), which equals A0/e. So:

A0/e = A0 e^(-t/(2τ)) → 1/e = e^(-t/(2τ)) → take ln both sides: -1 = -t/(2τ) → t/(2τ)=1 → t=2τ.

So t=8π/ω0 =2τ → τ=4π/ω0.

But τ is also the time constant for the amplitude decay, which is related to ζ and ω0.

From the exponential decay, the amplitude is A(t)=A0 e^(-t/(2τ)), and τ is related to the damping ratio. Specifically, τ = 1/(ζ ω0). Because the time constant for the amplitude decay is 2τ (as in, A(t)=A0 e^{-t/(2τ)} ), so the time to drop to 1/e is 2τ. So perhaps I should relate τ to ζ and ω0.

Wait, let me think again. The time constant for the amplitude to drop by 1/e is 2τ. So from the equation, τ_decay = 2τ.

But how is this related to ζ? I think the time constant τ_decay is given by 1/(ζ ω0). Because in the underdamped case, the amplitude decays as e^(-ζ ω0 t).

Wait, perhaps the correct relation is that the amplitude is A(t)=A0 e^(-ζ ω0 t). So the time to drop by 1/e is when ζ ω0 t =1 → t=1/(ζ ω0). So the time for 1/e decay is 1/(ζ ω0). But in our case, t=8π/ω0 = 2τ, where τ is the time constant for the amplitude decay, which is 1/(ζ ω0).

Wait, no, I think I might be mixing up definitions here. Let me get this straight. The amplitude of a damped oscillator is:

A(t) = A0 e^(- ζ ω0 t).

So when does A(t)=A0/e?

Set e^(- ζ ω0 t) = 1/e → -ζ ω0 t = -1 → t = 1/(ζ ω0).

In our problem, this t is 4T, where T is the natural period, T=2π/ω0. So 4T =4*(2π/ω0) )=8π/ω0=1/(ζ ω0).

So 8π/ω0 =1/(ζ ω0).

Multiply both sides by ω0: 8π =1/ζ → ζ=1/(8π).

Wait, that doesn't seem right. 8π is a large number, so ζ would be very small, which makes sense for a lightly damped oscillator.

But let me check the steps again. So, A(t)=A0 e^{- ζ ω0 t}.

At t=4T, amplitude is A0/e.

So e^{- ζ ω0 (4T)} =1/e → ζ ω0 (4T) =1 → 4T ζ ω0=1.

But T=2π/ω0 → 4T=8π/ω0.

So 4T * ζ ω0 = (8π/ω0) * ζ ω0 )=8π ζ=1 → ζ=1/(8π).

So ζ=1/(8π). Now, the ratio of the damped frequency to the natural frequency is ω/ω0= sqrt(1 - ζ^2).

So ω/ω0 = sqrt(1 - (1/(8π))^2 )= sqrt(1 - 1/(64 π²)).

But I need to find this ratio and match it with the given options.

Wait, the options are in terms of expressions like (n π)/sqrt(n² π² +1), etc. So perhaps I can manipulate sqrt(1 - 1/(64 π²)).

Let me compute sqrt( (64 π² -1 ) / (64 π²) ) )= sqrt(64 π² -1 )/(8 π).

So ω/ω0 = sqrt(64 π² -1 )/(8 π).

Hmm, but looking at the options, I don't see any that match this. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A: (4 π)/sqrt(16 π²+1)
B: (2 π)/sqrt(4 π²+1)
C: (12 π)/sqrt(144 π²+1)
D: (5 π)/sqrt(25 π²+1)
E: (10 π)/sqrt(100 π²+1)
F: (6 π)/sqrt(36 π²+1)
G: (9 π)/sqrt(81 π²+1)
H: (7 π)/sqrt(49 π²+1)
I: (8 π)/sqrt(64 π²+1)

Wait, my expression is sqrt(64 π² -1)/(8 π) = sqrt(64 π² -1)/(8 π).

But none of the options have a sqrt in the numerator with a subtraction. Instead, all options have (n π) in the numerator and sqrt(n² π² +1) in the denominator.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me go back.

Wait, I think I got the wrong expression for the amplitude decay. Let me recheck.

The amplitude of a damped harmonic oscillator is given by A(t) = A0 e^{- ζ ω0 t}, yes. So when A(t) = A0/e, we have:

e^{- ζ ω0 t} =1/e → ζ ω0 t =1 → t=1/(ζ ω0).

But in our problem, the time is t=4T, where T is the natural period: T=2π/ω0. So t=4*(2π/ω0)=8π/ω0.

So 8π/ω0 =1/(ζ ω0) → 8π = 1/ζ → ζ=1/(8π).

Thus, the ratio ω/ω0 is sqrt(1 - ζ²) = sqrt(1 - (1/(8π))² )=sqrt(1 -1/(64 π²)).

Hmm, that's sqrt( (64 π² -1 )/(64 π²) ) → sqrt(64 π² -1)/(8 π).

Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see that exact form. Let's see if any of the options can be rewritten in terms of this.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have considered the time for four cycles in terms of the damped frequency's period, not the natural frequency's. Let me think again.

Wait a second—did I make a mistake in assuming that the time is 4T, where T is the natural period? Or is the time 4T_d, where T_d is the period of the damped oscillator?

In the problem statement, it says "after four cycles." So if the oscillator is damped, its frequency is lower, so each cycle takes longer. So the time for four cycles would be 4T_d, where T_d is the period of the damped oscillator.

So that's a crucial point. So the time t is 4T_d, where T_d=2π/ω.

So the correct approach is to set t=4T_d=4*(2π/ω) =8π/ω.

So the amplitude at t=8π/ω is A(t)=A0/e.

So A(t)=A0 e^{- ζ ω0 t}.

But wait, no. The correct form is A(t)=A0 e^{- ζ ω0 t}.

So at t=8π/ω, A(t)=A0/e.

So:

A0/e =A0 e^{- ζ ω0 (8π/ω)}.

Divide both sides by A0 and take reciprocal:

e = e^{ζ ω0 (8π/ω)} → 1= ζ ω0 (8π/ω).

So 8π ζ ω0 / ω=1 → 8π ζ ω0 = ω.

But ω=ω0 sqrt(1-ζ²).

So substituting, 8π ζ ω0 = ω0 sqrt(1-ζ²).

Divide both sides by ω0:

8π ζ = sqrt(1-ζ²).

Square both sides:

64 π² ζ² = 1 - ζ² → 64 π² ζ² + ζ² =1 → ζ² (64 π² +1 )=1 → ζ²=1/(64 π² +1).

So ζ=1/sqrt(64 π² +1).

Now, we need to find ω/ω0= sqrt(1- ζ²)= sqrt(1 -1/(64 π² +1 ))= sqrt( (64 π² +1 -1)/(64 π² +1) )= sqrt(64 π²/(64 π² +1 ))= (8 π)/sqrt(64 π^2 +1).

So the ratio is (8 π)/sqrt(64 π^2 +1), which is option I.

To solve the problem, we analyze the damped harmonic oscillator's amplitude decay and relate it to the given conditions. The amplitude of a damped harmonic oscillator decreases exponentially over time as \( A(t) = A_0 e^{-\zeta \omega_0 t} \), where \( \zeta \) is the damping ratio, \( \omega_0 \) is the natural frequency, and \( t \) is time. The problem states that after four cycles, the amplitude drops to \( 1/e \) of its initial value. 

### Step 1: Relate time to cycles
The period of oscillation for a damped oscillator is \( T_d = \frac{2\pi}{\omega} \), where \( \omega \) is the damped frequency. After four cycles, the time elapsed is \( t = 4T_d = \frac{8\pi}{\omega} \).

### Step 2: Apply the amplitude condition
At \( t = \frac{8\pi}{\omega} \), the amplitude is \( A(t) = \frac{A_0}{e} \). Substituting into the amplitude equation:
\[
\frac{A_0}{e} = A_0 e^{-\zeta \omega_0 t}.
\]
Dividing through by \( A_0 \) and taking the natural logarithm:
\[
-\frac{1}{e} = -\zeta \omega_0 t \implies \zeta \omega_0 t = 1.
\]
Substituting \( t = \frac{8\pi}{\omega} \):
\[
\zeta \omega_0 \frac{8\pi}{\omega} = 1 \implies 8\pi \zeta \omega_0 = \omega.
\]

### Step 3: Express the damped frequency
The damped frequency \( \omega \) is related to the natural frequency \( \omega_0 \) by:
\[
\omega = \omega_0 \sqrt{1 - \zeta^2}.
\]
Substituting \( \omega = 8\pi \zeta \omega_0 \) into this equation:
\[
8\pi \zeta \omega_0 = \omega_0 \sqrt{1 - \zeta^2}.
\]
Dividing through by \( \omega_0 \):
\[
8\pi \zeta = \sqrt{1 - \zeta^2}.
\]
Squaring both sides:
\[
64\pi^2 \zeta^2 = 1 - \zeta^2 \implies 64\pi^2 \zeta^2 + \zeta^2 = 1 \implies \zeta^2 (64\pi^2 + 1) = 1.
\]
Solving for \( \zeta^2 \):
\[
\zeta^2 = \frac{1}{64\pi^2 + 1}.
\]

### Step 4: Find the frequency ratio
The ratio of the damped frequency to the natural frequency is:
\[
\frac{\omega}{\omega_0} = \sqrt{1 - \zeta^2}.
\]
Substituting \( \zeta^2 = \frac{1}{64\pi^2 + 1} \):
\[
\frac{\omega}{\omega_0} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{64\pi^2 + 1}} = \sqrt{\frac{64\pi^2}{64\pi^2 + 1}} = \frac{8\pi}{\sqrt{64\pi^2 + 1}}.
\]

### Step 5: Match with the options
The derived expression matches option **I**:
\[
\frac{8\pi}{\sqrt{64\pi^2 + 1}}.
\]
