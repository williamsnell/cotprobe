Question:

This question refers to the following information.
Read the following excerpt.
Never were talents of the highest genius of the most exalted kind, more profusely bestowed upon a human being. The genius of Napoleon is astounding. All branches of human knowledge seemed alike familiar to his gigantic mind. His conversations at St. Helena, scattered through the numerous and voluminous memorials of those who gleaned them, are replete with intensest interest. During the long agony of his imprisonment and his death, he conversed with perfect freedom upon the events of his marvelous career, and upon all those subjects or morals, politics, and religion, which most deeply concern the welfare of our race. There is no mind which will not be invigorated by familiarity with these profound thoughts, expressed with so much glow of feeling and energy of diction.

Okay, so I've got this question about Napoleon and an excerpt from a historian's work. The question is asking which action of Napoleon the author seems to ignore the hypocrisy of, while focusing on praising his high-mindedness. The options are A through J, but in the given list, it's up to H.

First, I need to understand the excerpt. The author, John S. C. Abbott, is talking about Napoleon's genius and how his conversations at St. Helena are full of deep thoughts on various subjects. He seems to admire Napoleon's intellect and the way he discussed serious topics like morals, politics, and religion. The author believes that familiarizing oneself with Napoleon's thoughts would invigorate the mind because they're expressed with such feeling and energy.

Now, the question is about what the author is ignoring in terms of hypocrisy. So I'm looking for something Napoleon did that might be morally questionable or hypocritical, but the author isn't addressing it while praising him.

Let's look at the options:

A: Manipulation of the press for political gain. That sounds plausible because many leaders use media to their advantage. But the excerpt is more about Napoleon's intellect and conversations, not his political tactics. Maybe the author isn't discussing this because it's more about image management.

B: Conquest of Europe and the Continental System. The conquest part is definitely a big deal. Napoleon expanded his empire, which could be seen as aggressive and imperialistic. The Continental System was his economic policy to weaken Britain by blocking trade. However, the author is focusing on Napoleon's deep thoughts and not his military or economic policies, so maybe this is something he's ignoring. But the question is about hypocrisy, so I'm not sure if this counts as hypocritical unless the author is ignoring Napoleon's expansionist ways while praising his intellect.

C: Imposition of French culture on conquered territories. This involves cultural imperialism. While Napoleon spread French culture, it might have been seen as oppressive by the locals. The author doesn't mention this, focusing instead on Napoleon's broad knowledge and conversations. So the author might be ignoring this aspect, which could be hypocritical if Napoleon was imposing his culture on others while discussing high-minded topics.

D: Invasion of Haiti to stop a slave revolt. This is a specific event. Invading Haiti to suppress a slave revolt could be seen as hypocritical if Napoleon was against slavery but took actions that supported it or if he used the situation for his own gain. The author doesn't talk about this; he's more focused on Napoleon's intellectual side. So maybe the author is ignoring this event, which could be a hypocritical action.

E: Establishment of the Bank of France. This is more about economic policy. The author isn't discussing financial policies, so this might not be the focus. I don't see how this relates to hypocrisy in the context of the excerpt.

F: Self-appointment as Emperor of France. This is a significant action. Napoleon crowned himself emperor, which some might see as greedy or power-hungry. The author doesn't mention this, focusing instead on Napoleon's intellect and discussions on important topics. So the author is ignoring this action, which could be seen as hypocritical because it's about self-aggrandizement.

G: Promoting soldiers and government workers based on merit. The author might actually approve of this, as it's a positive action. The excerpt praises Napoleon's genius and how he dealt with various subjects, so this might align with his image as a capable leader. The author isn't ignoring this; it's more about meritocracy, which is a good thing.

H: Creation of the Napoleonic Code. This is a legal system that introduced many reforms. The author might not be discussing this, but it's a positive action, so it's less likely to be hypocritical. The question is about ignoring something negative, so this might not be the right choice.

So, looking at the options, the author is ignoring something that contradicts Napoleon's image as a high-minded, intellectual leader. The options that fit this are A, B, C, D, and F.

Between these, I think the author is ignoring Napoleon's self-appointment as Emperor (F) because that's a clear act of power hunger and hypocrisy if he's being praised for his intellect and moral discussions. Alternatively, the invasion of Haiti (D) could be hypocritical if he was against slavery but took actions that supported it or exploited the situation.

Wait, but the excerpt doesn't mention anything about Napoleon's military actions or his political self-promotion. The author is focusing on his conversations and intellect, not his actions as a ruler. So the author is ignoring the negative actions while highlighting the positive intellectual aspects.

Which of these actions is more clearly hypocritical in the context of being a high-minded person? Self-appointment as Emperor might be seen as narcissistic and power-hungry, which would be hypocritical if he's discussing matters of state and leadership with depth. On the other hand, invading Haiti to stop a slave revolt could be seen as hypocritical if he was against slavery but used military force to maintain control, perhaps continuing or supporting it in some way.

But the excerpt doesn't provide context on Napoleon's stance on slavery. The author is focusing on his intellect and the depth of his conversations, not his policies or military actions. So the author is ignoring the fact that Napoleon took actions that might contradict his high-mindedness, such as becoming emperor, which could be seen as self-serving.

Alternatively, the conquest of Europe (B) is a significant action that the author ignores while praising Napoleon's intellect. The author doesn't mention the negative aspects of Napoleon's rule, so the author is ignoring the hypocrisy in his actions, such as the aggressive expansion and the use of the Continental System, which could be seen as hypocritical if he's discussing the welfare of the race but engaging in aggressive policies.

But the question is about what the author is ignoring in his examination. The author is focusing on Napoleon's high-mindedness and praiseworthiness, so the action that seems hypocritical is the self-appointment as Emperor, which is a clear act of power and perhaps hypocrisy if he's discussing matters of governance and leadership with such depth but then taking such a self-centered action.

Wait, but the excerpt doesn't mention Napoleon's rise to power or his self-coronation. It's more about his conversations and intellect. So the author is ignoring the fact that Napoleon declared himself emperor, which is a significant action that could be seen as hypocritical if he's being portrayed as a wise and just leader.

Alternatively, the invasion of Haiti (D) might be more about using force to maintain control, which could be hypocritical if he's discussing matters of morality and justice. However, without knowing Napoleon's stance on slavery, it's harder to judge.

I think the best fit is F: His self-appointment as Emperor of France. The author is ignoring this action, which is a clear example of hypocrisy because it shows Napoleon's desire for power, which might contrast with his discussions on leadership and governance.

The author, John S. C. Abbott, focuses on Napoleon's intellect and the depth of his conversations on moral, political, and religious topics, praising his genius and the value of his thoughts. However, the author seems to ignore actions that might contradict Napoleon's portrayal as a high-minded and praiseworthy leader. Among the options, the self-appointment as Emperor of France stands out as a hypocritical action. This act of declaring himself emperor highlights Napoleon's desire for power, which could be seen as hypocritical given his discussions on governance and leadership. The author's focus on Napoleon's intellectual and conversational prowess overlooks this significant aspect of his rule, making it the most plausible answer.

Answer: F
