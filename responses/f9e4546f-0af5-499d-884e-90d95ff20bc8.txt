Okay, so I need to figure out how much Peter paid for the typewriter. Let's break it down step by step. 

First, the typewriter originally costs $125, but there's a 5% discount. So I should calculate the discount amount and subtract it from the original price. 

5% of $125 is calculated as 0.05 * 125. Let me do that: 0.05 times 125 equals 6.25. So the discount is $6.25. Subtracting that from $125 gives me 125 - 6.25 = $118.75. So after the discount, the price is $118.75.

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right because the next step involves taxes. I think I might have made a mistake here. Let me double-check. Oh, wait, no, the discount is applied first, then the taxes are added. So yes, after the discount, it's $118.75.

Now, I need to calculate the taxes. The state sales tax is 4.5%, and the city tax is 2.5%. I think these are both applied to the discounted price. So first, I'll calculate each tax separately and then add them together.

Calculating the state tax: 4.5% of $118.75. Let's see, 0.045 * 118.75. Hmm, 0.045 is the same as 45/1000. Let me compute 118.75 * 0.045. 

Breaking it down: 100 * 0.045 is 4.5, 18.75 * 0.045 is 0.84375. Adding them together gives 4.5 + 0.84375 = $5.34375. So the state tax is approximately $5.34.

Next, the city tax: 2.5% of $118.75. That's 0.025 * 118.75. Let me compute that. 100 * 0.025 is 2.5, 18.75 * 0.025 is 0.46875. Adding those gives 2.5 + 0.46875 = $2.96875. So the city tax is approximately $2.97.

Now, add both taxes together: $5.34 + $2.97 = $8.31. So the total taxes are about $8.31.

Wait, but I think another way to do this is to add the tax rates together first. So 4.5% + 2.5% equals 7%. Then, calculate 7% of $118.75. Let me try that: 0.07 * 118.75. 

Calculating: 100 * 0.07 is 7, 18.75 * 0.07 is 1.3125. Adding those gives 7 + 1.3125 = $8.3125, which is $8.31 when rounded to the nearest cent. So that matches my previous calculation. Good.

Now, adding the total taxes to the discounted price: $118.75 + $8.31 = $127.06. 

Wait, but looking at the options, option D is $127.06. So that should be the correct answer.

But hold on a second, I'm a bit confused because sometimes taxes are applied after discounts, but is there a possibility that the discount is applied after taxes? Let me think. No, the way the problem is phrased, it says "less a 5% discount," so the discount comes first. Then the taxes are applied to the discounted amount. So I think my calculation is correct.

Let me just go through the steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 

Original price: $125. 
Discount: 5% of 125 is 6.25, so 125 - 6.25 = 118.75.

Total taxes: 4.5% + 2.5% = 7% on 118.75. 7% of 118.75 is 8.3125.

So total price: 118.75 + 8.3125 = 127.0625, which is $127.06 when rounded.

Looking at the options, D is $127.06, so that should be the correct answer.

The correct answer is calculated by first applying the 5% discount to the original price of $125, resulting in $118.75. Then, the combined tax rate of 7% (4.5% state + 2.5% city) is applied to $118.75, yielding $8.31 in taxes. Adding this to the discounted price gives a total of $127.06.
