Question:

Explain what is meant by an animal's ecological niche, and definecompetitive exclusion.

Options:

A: Niche refers to the specific diet of an organism, while competitive exclusion is the dominance of one species over another in acquiring food.
B: Niche is the physical area where an organism lives
C: An ecological niche is the temperature range an organism prefers, and competitive exclusion means that species with the same temperature preferences cannot live in the same area.
D: Niche is defined by the habitat of an organism
E: Competitive exclusion means two species with similar niches can coexist in the same habitat
F: Niche is the functional role and position of an organism within its ecosystem. Competitive exclusion states that unless the niches of two species differ, they cannot coexist in the same habitat.
G: Competitive exclusion refers to the idea that no two species can share the same predators, while a niche is determined by the predators of an organism.
H: Niche is the set of behaviors an organism exhibits, and competitive exclusion implies that two species will eventually merge into one if they have similar behaviors.
I: Niche is the social role of an organism in a group, and competitive exclusion dictates that two species with the same social roles cannot exist together in a social group.
J: Ecological niche is the time of day an animal is most active. Competitive exclusion suggests that two species cannot be active at the same time.

Okay, so I've got this question about ecological niches and competitive exclusion. Hmm, I remember from biology class that an ecological niche refers to the role an organism plays in its environment. It's like how a species fits into the ecosystem, including where it lives, what it eats, and how it interacts with other species. So the niche isn't just the habitat or the diet alone, but the whole package of how it functions in the ecosystem.

Now, looking at the options, I need to pick the correct definitions. Let's go through each option one by one.

Option A says the niche is the specific diet and competitive exclusion is one species dominating in food acquisition. That doesn't sound right because niche isn't just about diet. It's broader than that.

Option B says the niche is the physical area where the organism lives. That's part of it, but the niche includes more than just habitat, like diet and interactions too. So B is incomplete.

Option C defines niche as the temperature range and competitive exclusion about same temperature preferences. That's too narrow. Niche isn't just about temperature; it's a broader concept.

Option D says niche is the habitat, which again is only a part of the niche. So D is incorrect.

Option E states that two species with similar niches can coexist. Wait, no, competitive exclusion usually says that if two species have too similar niches, one might outcompete the other, so they can't coexist unless their niches are distinct. So E is the opposite; it's not correct.

Option F says the niche is the functional role and position in the ecosystem, and competitive exclusion means two species can't coexist if their niches are the same. That sounds right. The niche includes the role and position, and competitive exclusion (like the principle of competitive exclusion) says that species with identical niches can't stably coexist; one will dominate.

Option G talks about predators. Competitive exclusion isn't just about predators; it's about resource use. So G is wrong.

Option H says niche is about behaviors and exclusion is about merging species. No, niche isn't just behaviors, and merging species is more about speciation than competitive exclusion.

Option I mentions social roles. That's not related to ecological niches or competitive exclusion. So I is incorrect.

Option J says niche is the time of day active, and exclusion is about not being active at the same time. That's more about temporal niches, but competitive exclusion is broader than just timing.

So the correct answer should be F. It correctly defines the niche and explains competitive exclusion accurately.

The ecological niche refers to the functional role and position of an organism within its ecosystem, encompassing aspects like habitat, diet, and interactions with other species. Competitive exclusion, often associated with the principle of competitive exclusion, states that two species with identical or very similar niches cannot stably coexist in the same habitat; one will eventually outcompete the other.

Answer: F
