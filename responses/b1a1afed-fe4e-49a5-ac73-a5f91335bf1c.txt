A: $350 per year, $850 after first year, $500 after second year
B: $100 per year, $1100 after first year, $1000 after second year
C: $400 per year, $800 after first year, $400 after second year
D: $250 per year, $950 after first year, $700 after second year
E: $600 per year, $600 after first year, $0 after second year
F: $500 per year, $700 after first year, $200 after second year
G: $150 per year, $1050 after first year, $900 after second year
H: $200 per year, $1000 after first year, $800 after second year
I: $300 per year, $900 after first year, $600 after second year

Okay, so I need to figure out the depreciation and book value for the first two years of Joe's chain saw. Let me think about this step by step.

First, the question says Joe bought a chain saw for $1,200 and it'll last 6 years with no residual value. He's using the straight-line method of depreciation. So I remember that straight-line depreciation is when you spread the cost evenly over the useful life.

So the formula for straight-line depreciation is (Cost - Salvage Value) / Useful Life. In this case, the cost is $1,200. Since there's no residual value, salvage value is 0. The useful life is 6 years.

So annual depreciation would be 1200 divided by 6. Let me calculate that: 1200 รท 6 equals 200. So the depreciation each year is $200. That means each year, the book value decreases by $200.

Now, the first year's book value would be the original cost minus the first year's depreciation. So $1,200 minus $200 is $1,000. The second year's depreciation is another $200, so the book value after the second year would be $1,000 minus $200, which is $800.

Looking at the options, option H says $200 per year, $1000 after first year, and $800 after second. That matches what I calculated.

The straight-line depreciation method spreads the cost evenly over the useful life.

**Depreciation per year:**
- Total cost: \$1,200
- Useful life: 6 years
- Depreciation = \$1,200 / 6 = \$200 per year.

**Book value after first year:**
- Book value = \$1,200 - \$200 = \$1,000.

**Book value after second year:**
- Book value = \$1,000 - \$200 = \$800.

**Answer:**
H: \$200 per year, \$1,000 after first year, \$800 after second year.

Answer: H
