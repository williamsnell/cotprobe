Okay, so I have this question about malware types, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. The question is asking what a program is called that steals logins and passwords for instant messaging applications. The options are A through J. Let me go through each option one by one to see which makes the most sense.

Starting with option A: Banking Trojan. I know that banking trojans are specifically designed to target financial information, like online banking credentials. So they might steal credit card numbers or bank login details, but the question is about instant messaging apps, which are different. So probably not A.

Option B: Rootkit Trojan. Rootkits are a type of malware that gain root access to a system, allowing them to hide and take control. While they can be used for various malicious purposes, including stealing information, they aren't specifically tied to stealing IM credentials. So maybe not B.

Option C: Worm-Downloader. Worms are malware that replicate themselves and spread to other computers. A downloader would typically install other malicious software. While it could be used to steal information, the name doesn't specify IM credentials, so I'm not sure if this is the best fit.

Option D: Keylogging Malware. Keyloggers are programs that record keystrokes, which means they can capture any information you type, including logins and passwords. Since IM apps require logins, keylogging malware could definitely steal those. This seems like a strong candidate.

Option E: Backdoor Trojans. Backdoors allow remote access to a system, giving attackers control. While they can be used to steal information, the term doesn't specifically point to IM credentials.

Option F: Email Spyware. This would target email accounts, not necessarily IM apps. So probably not F.

Option G: Trojan-Downloader. Similar to Worm-Downloader, this would download other malware. But again, it's not specific to IM.

Option H: IM – Trojans. This one is actually named after IM, so it seems relevant. It's a type of Trojan specifically targeting instant messaging applications. That sounds exactly like what the question is describing.

Option I: Ransom Trojan. Ransomware encrypts data and demands payment for decryption. It's more about blocking access than stealing credentials, so probably not I.

Option J: Infostealer Trojan. Infostealers are designed to steal information. Since IM logins are information, this is a possible answer. But I have to compare it with H, which is more specific.

So between D, H, and J. D is keylogging, which is a method, not a specific type targeting IM. H is IM-Trojan, which is specific. J is Infostealer, which is broader.

The question is asking for the program that steals IM logins specifically. So the most accurate answer would be H: IM – Trojans, because it's directly named after the target (IM). Alternatively, J is also possible because it's an infostealer, but it's more general. However, H is more precise here.

The correct answer is H: IM – Trojans, as it directly refers to malware targeting instant messaging applications.

Answer: H
