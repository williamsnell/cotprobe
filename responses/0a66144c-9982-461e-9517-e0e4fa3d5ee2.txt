Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about diagnostic techniques and neural tube defects. I need to figure out which one is not useful for diagnosing it. Let me think through each option step by step.

First, what are neural tube defects? They're birth defects that happen when the neural tube, which forms the brain and spinal cord, doesn't close properly during early development. Common examples include spina bifida and anencephaly.

Now, the question is asking which of the listed techniques is of no value in diagnosing these defects. So I need to go through each option and see if they're used for this purpose.

Option A: Chorion villus sampling (CVS). I remember that CVS is a prenatal test where they take a sample of the chorionic villi, which are part of the placenta. It can be done early in pregnancy, around 10-12 weeks. CVS can detect chromosomal abnormalities and some genetic disorders, but does it help with neural tube defects? I think neural tube defects are more structural, so maybe CVS isn't the primary method. But wait, sometimes they can do biochemical tests from CVS to check for certain markers, but I'm not sure if it's commonly used for NTDs. Maybe it's more for genetic issues.

Option B: Positron emission tomography (PET) scan. PET scans are used to look at the body's metabolic processes. They're often used in oncology to see how cancers are responding to treatment, or in neurology to assess brain function. Do they have a role in diagnosing neural tube defects? I don't think so. NTDs are structural issues, and PET scans aren't typically used for that. They might be more for functional imaging rather than structural anomalies.

Option C: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MRI uses magnetic fields and radio waves to create detailed images of the body. It's great for soft tissues and can clearly show the brain and spinal cord. So for neural tube defects, especially after birth, MRI would be very useful to see the extent of the defect. So this is a valuable technique.

Option D: Biopsy. A biopsy involves taking a sample of tissue to examine under a microscope. For neural tube defects, I think this would be more relevant after birth, perhaps in cases where there's uncertainty or for research purposes. But during prenatal diagnosis, biopsy isn't typically done because it's invasive and carries risks. However, if the question is about any use, then maybe in some cases, but I'm not sure if it's commonly used for NTDs.

Option E: Blood pressure measurement. Hmm, blood pressure is a vital sign but I don't see how it relates directly to neural tube defects. Unless high blood pressure in the mother is a risk factor, but measuring it wouldn't diagnose the defect itself. So this seems unrelated to diagnosing NTDs.

Option F: Computed tomography (CT) scan. CT scans use X-rays to create cross-sectional images. They're good for bony structures and can sometimes be used to look at the brain, but they involve radiation. For neural tube defects, especially in the brain, CT might be useful, but MRI is usually preferred because it's better for soft tissues without radiation. So CT could have some value, but maybe not as the first choice.

Option G: Maternal serum screening. This refers to blood tests done on the mother to check for certain markers that might indicate an increased risk of birth defects, including neural tube defects. For example, elevated levels of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) in the mother's blood can sometimes be a marker. So this is definitely a useful screening tool.

Option H: Ultrasonography. Ultrasound uses sound waves to create images and is the primary method for prenatal diagnosis of structural abnormalities. Neural tube defects can often be seen on an ultrasound, especially if there's an open defect like spina bifida. So this is a very valuable technique.

Option I: Electroencephalogram (EEG). EEG measures electrical activity in the brain and is used to diagnose seizures, epilepsy, and other neurological conditions. While NTDs can cause neurological issues, EEG wouldn't directly diagnose the structural defect itself. It would be more for assessing symptoms after the defect is identified.

Option J: Amniocentesis. This is a procedure where amniotic fluid is sampled to check for chromosomal abnormalities or genetic disorders. It can also measure AFP levels, which might be elevated in cases of NTDs. So amniocentesis can be useful, especially in confirming the presence of a defect when other tests are inconclusive.

Now, putting it all together. The question is which technique is of no value. So I need to find the one that doesn't help in diagnosing NTDs.

CVS (A) can sometimes be used with biochemical tests, but it's more for genetic reasons. PET (B) doesn't seem helpful for structural issues. Blood pressure (E) isn't related to the defect itself. Biopsy (D) is more for after birth. Amnio (J) can help, as can maternal serum (G) and ultrasound (H). MRI (C) is postnatal. CT (F) might be used but not as common. EEG (I) assesses function, not structure.

So the options that are definitely not useful would be E (blood pressure), B (PET), and maybe I (EEG). But wait, the question is about diagnostic techniques for NTDs. So which one is of no value? 

Blood pressure measurement (E) is definitely not useful for diagnosing NTDs. It's about maternal health, not the fetus's structure.

The question asks which diagnostic technique is of no value for diagnosing neural tube defects (NTDs). Neural tube defects are structural abnormalities, so techniques that do not provide structural imaging or specific markers for NTDs are not useful. 

- **A: Chorion villus sampling (CVS)** can sometimes detect biochemical markers, but it is primarily for genetic disorders.  
- **B: Positron emission tomography (PET) scan** is used for functional imaging, not structural defects.  
- **C: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)** is useful for detailed structural imaging postnatally.  
- **D: Biopsy** is not typically used for prenatal diagnosis of NTDs.  
- **E: Blood pressure measurement** is unrelated to diagnosing NTDs.  
- **F: Computed tomography (CT) scan** can provide structural images but is less preferred for soft tissues.  
- **G: Maternal serum screening** can detect biochemical markers like elevated AFP.  
- **H: Ultrasonography** is the primary prenatal imaging method for NTDs.  
- **I: Electroencephalogram (EEG)** assesses brain function, not structural defects.  
- **J: Amniocentesis** can measure AFP levels to confirm NTDs.  

Among these, **blood pressure measurement (E)** is entirely unrelated to diagnosing NTDs. 

Answer: E
