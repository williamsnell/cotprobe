Okay, so I've got this equation to solve: sqrt(x² + x + 1) + sqrt(2x² + x + 5) = sqrt(x² - 3x + 13). Hmm, it's a bit intimidating with all those square roots. I remember that when dealing with square roots, I should check the domain first, making sure all expressions inside the square roots are non-negative.

Let me write down each expression inside the square roots:

1. For sqrt(x² + x + 1), the inside is x² + x +1. Let me see if this is always non-negative. The discriminant is 1² - 4*1*1 = 1 -4 = -3, which is negative. That means this quadratic has no real roots and since the coefficient of x² is positive, it's always positive. So no worries here.

2. For sqrt(2x² + x +5), the inside is 2x² +x +5. The discriminant is 1 -4*2*5 = 1 -40 = -39, also negative. So again, it's always positive. Good.

3. For sqrt(x² -3x +13), inside is x² -3x +13. Discriminant: 9 -52 = -43, which is negative. So this is always positive as well.

So all the square roots are defined for all real numbers. Now, I need to solve the equation. Maybe I can square both sides to eliminate the square roots, but I remember that squaring can sometimes introduce extraneous solutions, so I'll have to check any solutions I find.

Let me denote the equation as:

sqrt(A) + sqrt(B) = sqrt(C), where A = x² + x +1, B = 2x² +x +5, and C = x² -3x +13.

So, sqrt(A) + sqrt(B) = sqrt(C)

I'll square both sides:

(sqrt(A) + sqrt(B))² = (sqrt(C))²
A + 2*sqrt(A*B) + B = C

Substituting A, B, and C:

(x² + x +1) + (2x² +x +5) + 2*sqrt{(x² +x +1)(2x² +x +5)} = x² -3x +13

Let me simplify the left side:

x² +x +1 + 2x² +x +5 = 3x² + 2x +6

So the equation becomes:

3x² + 2x +6 + 2*sqrt{(x² +x +1)(2x² +x +5)} = x² -3x +13

Now, subtract (3x² + 2x +6) from both sides:

2*sqrt{(x² +x +1)(2x² +x +5)} = (x² -3x +13) - (3x² +2x +6)

Simplify the right side:

x² -3x +13 -3x² -2x -6 = (-2x² -5x +7)

So now we have:

2*sqrt{(x² +x +1)(2x² +x +5)} = -2x² -5x +7

Hmm, since sqrt is always non-negative, the left side is non-negative, so the right side must also be non-negative. So:

-2x² -5x +7 ≥ 0

Let me solve this inequality. Multiply both sides by -1 (remembering to reverse the inequality):

2x² +5x -7 ≤ 0

Find the roots of 2x² +5x -7 = 0.

Using quadratic formula: x = [-5 ± sqrt(25 +56)] / (2*2) = [-5 ± sqrt(81)]/4 = [-5 ±9]/4.

So the roots are (4)/4=1 and (-14)/4=-3.5.

So the inequality 2x² +5x -7 ≤0 is satisfied between x = -3.5 and x=1.

So any solution must lie between -3.5 and 1. I'll keep that in mind.

Now, going back to the equation:

2*sqrt{(x² +x +1)(2x² +x +5)} = -2x² -5x +7

I can divide both sides by 2:

sqrt{(x² +x +1)(2x² +x +5)} = (-2x² -5x +7)/2

Now, square both sides again to eliminate the square root:

(x² +x +1)(2x² +x +5) = [(-2x² -5x +7)/2]^2

Let me compute both sides.

Left side: (x² +x +1)(2x² +x +5)

Let me multiply these two quadratics:

= x²*(2x² +x +5) + x*(2x² +x +5) +1*(2x² +x +5)
= 2x^4 +x^3 +5x² + 2x^3 +x² +5x +2x² +x +5
Combine like terms:

2x^4 + (1x^3 +2x^3) + (5x² +x² +2x²) + (5x +x) +5
= 2x^4 +3x^3 +8x² +6x +5

Right side: [(-2x² -5x +7)/2]^2

= [(-2x² -5x +7)^2]/4

Let me compute (-2x² -5x +7)^2:

= ( -2x² )^2 + (-5x)^2 +7^2 + 2*(-2x²)*(-5x) + 2*(-2x²)*7 + 2*(-5x)*7

= 4x^4 +25x^2 +49 + 20x^3 + (-28x²) + (-70x)

Wait, let me compute it step by step:

(-2x² -5x +7)(-2x² -5x +7)

Multiply term by term:

-2x²*(-2x²) = 4x^4
-2x²*(-5x) = 10x^3
-2x²*7 = -14x²

-5x*(-2x²) =10x^3
-5x*(-5x) =25x²
-5x*7 =-35x

7*(-2x²) =-14x²
7*(-5x) =-35x
7*7=49

Now, sum all terms:

4x^4 +10x^3 -14x² +10x^3 +25x² -35x -14x² -35x +49

Combine like terms:

4x^4 + (10x^3 +10x^3) + (-14x² +25x² -14x²) + (-35x -35x) +49

=4x^4 +20x^3 + (-3x²) + (-70x) +49

So the right side becomes (4x^4 +20x^3 -3x² -70x +49)/4

Now, the equation is:

Left side = Right side

2x^4 +3x^3 +8x^2 +6x +5 = (4x^4 +20x^3 -3x² -70x +49)/4

Multiply both sides by 4 to eliminate the denominator:

4*(2x^4 +3x^3 +8x² +6x +5) = 4x^4 +20x^3 -3x² -70x +49

Left side: 8x^4 +12x^3 +32x² +24x +20

So equation becomes:

8x^4 +12x^3 +32x² +24x +20 = 4x^4 +20x^3 -3x² -70x +49

Bring all terms to left side:

8x^4 -4x^4 +12x^3 -20x^3 +32x² +3x² +24x +70x +20 -49 =0

Simplify:

4x^4 -8x^3 +35x² +94x -29 =0

Wait, let me check the subtraction:

8x^4 -4x^4 =4x^4

12x^3 -20x^3= -8x^3

32x² - (-3x²) =32x² +3x²=35x²

24x - (-70x)=24x +70x=94x

20 -49= -29

So the equation is:

4x^4 -8x^3 +35x² +94x -29=0

Wow, that's a quartic equation. Solving this might be tricky. Maybe I can try rational roots. The possible rational roots are factors of 29 over factors of 4. So possible roots: ±1, ±29, ±1/2, ±29/2, etc.

Let me test x=1:

4(1)^4 -8(1)^3 +35(1)^2 +94(1) -29=4 -8 +35 +94 -29= (4-8)= -4 +35=31 +94=125 -29=96 ≠0.

x= -1:

4(-1)^4 -8(-1)^3 +35(-1)^2 +94(-1) -29=4 +8 +35 -94 -29= (4+8)=12 +35=47 -94= -47 -29= -76 ≠0.

x=29 is too big, maybe try x=1/2:

4*(1/2)^4 -8*(1/2)^3 +35*(1/2)^2 +94*(1/2) -29

=4*(1/16) -8*(1/8) +35*(1/4) +47 -29

= (1/4) -1 + (35/4) +47 -29

= (1/4 -1) = (-3/4) + (35/4) = (32/4)=8 +47=55 -29=26 ≠0.

x= -1/2:

4*(1/16) -8*(-1/8) +35*(1/4) +94*(-1/2) -29

= (1/4) +1 + (35/4) -47 -29

= (1/4 +1) = (5/4) +35/4=40/4=10 -47=-37 -29=-66 ≠0.

Hmm, maybe x=7/2? Let's see, but that's getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can factor this quartic.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake earlier in expanding the products. Let me double-check the multiplication steps because the quartic seems complicated.

Wait, when I squared sqrt(A) + sqrt(B) earlier, perhaps I should check that again.

Wait, the initial equation after squaring once was:

3x² + 2x +6 + 2*sqrt{(x² +x +1)(2x² +x +5)} = x² -3x +13.

Subtracting 3x² +2x +6 from both sides:

2*sqrt(...) = -2x² -5x +7.

Then, I squared both sides again. Maybe I should try substituting x values from the options to see if they satisfy the original equation.

Looking at the options, let me see the possible roots. The options are A, B, C, etc., each with different pairs.

Option A: [0.2807764064, -1.7807764064]

Option E: [-1.2807764064, 2.2807764064]

But wait, earlier I found that solutions must be between -3.5 and 1. So any solution beyond that is invalid. So in option E, 2.28 is >1, which is outside the allowed interval, so E is invalid.

Similarly, option B has 1.2807, which is just above 1. It's at x=1.28, which is beyond 1. So maybe B is invalid as well.

Option C: [1.78, -0.28] - 1.78 is beyond 1, so invalid.

Option D: empty. Maybe possible.

Option F: [0.28, 2.78]. 2.78 is beyond 1, so invalid.

G: [-3.78, 0.78]. -3.78 is less than -3.5, so outside.

H: [-0.28, 1.78]. 1.78 is beyond 1, invalid.

I: [-1.78, 0.28]. Both within -3.5 and 1, so possible.

J: [0,2], 2 is beyond 1, invalid.

So the only possible options are A, I, and D.

Wait, A is [0.28, -1.78]. Both within -3.5 and 1? 0.28 is within, -1.78 is within.

I is [-1.78, 0.28]. Both within.

So perhaps the real roots are two: 0.28 and -1.78. Or maybe one of them is invalid.

Alternatively, perhaps only one solution exists, but the options may have two, but maybe they're both in the valid range.

Let me try plugging x=0.2807764064 into the original equation.

Compute sqrt(x² +x +1) + sqrt(2x² +x +5) and see if it equals sqrt(x² -3x +13).

Compute each term:

x ≈0.2807764

x² ≈0.0788

sqrt(0.0788 + 0.2807764 +1) = sqrt(1.3595764) ≈1.166

sqrt(2*(0.0788) +0.2807764 +5)=sqrt(0.1576 +0.2807764 +5)=sqrt(5.4383764)≈2.332

Sum ≈1.166 +2.332≈3.498

Now compute sqrt(x² -3x +13):

x²≈0.0788, -3x≈-0.8423, so 0.0788 -0.8423 +13≈12.2365. sqrt(12.2365)≈3.497≈3.498. So it's close. So x≈0.280776 is a solution.

Now check x≈-1.7807764064.

Compute sqrt(x² +x +1):

x≈-1.7807764

x²≈3.171

x² +x +1≈3.171 -1.7807764 +1≈3.171 -0.7807764≈2.3902

sqrt(2.3902)≈1.546

sqrt(2x² +x +5):

2x²≈6.342, x=-1.7807764, so 6.342 -1.7807764 +5≈6.342 +3.219≈9.561. sqrt(9.561)≈3.092.

Sum≈1.546 +3.092≈4.638.

Now compute sqrt(x² -3x +13):

x²≈3.171, -3x≈5.342, so 3.171 +5.342 +13≈21.513. sqrt(21.513)≈4.638. So it's correct.

So both x≈0.280776 and x≈-1.780776 are solutions.

Looking at the options, option A is [0.2807764064, -1.7807764064], which matches.

But earlier, I thought maybe the quartic equation would have two roots, but when I tried solving it, I couldn't find rational roots, so perhaps the quartic factors into quadratics or something else. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in expanding earlier.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use substitution.

Wait, but given that both x≈0.28 and x≈-1.78 satisfy the original equation, and they are within the domain, so the correct answer would be option A.

Another option that includes both is A. However, option I is [-1.78, 0.28], which is the same as A but in reverse order, but since the question asks for ascending order, A is [0.28, -1.78], which is not in order. Wait, no, in the options, A is [0.2807764064, -1.7807764064], but that's not in ascending order since -1.78 is less than 0.28. So perhaps the correct list is [-1.78, 0.28], which is option I.

Wait, looking back at the options:

Option A: [0.2807764064, -1.7807764064]

Option I: [-1.7807764064, 0.2807764064]

So the correct order is ascending, so the smaller number first. So the correct list is [-1.7807764064, 0.2807764064], which is option I.

Wait, but when I tested x≈-1.78 and x≈0.28, both worked. So the real roots are x≈-1.78 and x≈0.28, so the list should be ordered as [-1.78, 0.28], which is option I.

But earlier I thought option A was correct, but perhaps I misread the options. Let me check again.

Yes, the options are:

A: [0.2807764064, -1.7807764064]

I: [-1.7807764064, 0.2807764064]

Since the question asks for the list in ascending order, so the correct order is from smaller to larger, which is option I.

Wait, but when I calculated, x≈0.28 worked, and x≈-1.78 worked. So the roots are approximately -1.78 and 0.28. So in ascending order, it's [-1.78, 0.28], which is option I.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier steps, but the tests confirm both roots are valid.

Wait, but when I squared both sides twice, I might have introduced extraneous roots, so it's essential to check.

Wait, but both x≈0.28 and x≈-1.78 satisfy the original equation, as I checked numerically. So both are valid roots, and they are the only ones in the domain.

So the correct list is option I.
</think>

The equation is solved by identifying the real roots within the domain and verifying them by substitution. The valid roots are approximately -1.7807764064 and 0.2807764064, which, when ordered in ascending order, form the list [-1.7807764064, 0.2807764064].

Answer: I
