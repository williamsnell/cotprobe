Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about voting populations, and I need to figure out which statement is the most accurate. Let me go through each option one by one and think about what I know regarding voter behavior.

Option A says voters are more likely to vote at age 18 than at 65. Hmm, I remember reading that younger voters, especially those in their late teens and early twenties, tend to have lower voter turnout. I think this is because they might be newer to the voting process or less engaged. On the other hand, older voters, like those in their 60s and beyond, usually have higher turnout rates because they're more established and possibly more politically involved. So A might not be correct.

Option B claims that someone with a bachelor's degree is less likely to vote than someone with just a high school diploma. Wait, that doesn't sound right. From what I know, higher education is often correlated with higher voter turnout. People with more education are more politically aware and may be more inclined to participate. So B seems incorrect.

Option C states that affluent individuals are less likely to vote than those who are impoverished. That also doesn't make sense. I recall that wealthier people tend to vote more because they have more resources and are often more politically active. They might feel their votes matter more or have more stake in the outcomes. So C is probably wrong.

Option D says individuals are less likely to vote in a closely contested race. Wait, that seems counterintuitive. In a close race, the stakes are higher, so I would think people are more motivated to vote because their vote could make a difference. For example, in a tight election, people might be more eager to participate to ensure their candidate wins. So D might be incorrect.

Option E claims individuals without a high school diploma are more likely to vote than those who have one. That doesn't align with what I know. Education is generally a strong predictor of voting behavior. People with higher education tend to vote more. So someone without a diploma would likely have lower turnout, making E incorrect.

Option F suggests people in rural areas are less likely to vote than those in urban areas. I'm not entirely sure about this. Urban areas might have more resources and get more attention from campaigns, leading to higher turnout. But rural areas can sometimes have lower turnout because access to polling stations might be harder. I'm not certain, but this could be correct. I'll keep this in mind.

Option G states that someone with a graduate degree is more likely to vote than someone with only a high school diploma. This aligns with my previous thought that higher education correlates with higher turnout. So G seems accurate.

Wait, let me double-check each option. So A is wrong because 18-year-olds vote less than 65-year-olds. B is wrong because higher education (bachelor's) leads to more voting, not less. C is wrong because the affluent do vote more. D is wrong because close races might increase turnout. E is wrong because no diploma means lower turnout. F is possibly correct, but I'm not as confident. G is correct because higher degrees mean higher likelihood to vote.

So, looking at the options, G seems correct. But wait, what about F? I'm not certain. I think urban areas have higher turnout because of more campaign activities and easier access, but some rural areas might have lower turnout. However, I'm not sure if that's a general rule. Maybe F isn't necessarily correct. So, focusing on the options, G is a strong contender.

Wait another thought: Option D says less likely to vote in a closely contested race. That seems off because in a close race, people are more motivated. So D is incorrect.

So, the most accurate statements are G and possibly F. But I'm more confident about G. So G is the correct answer.

The most accurate statement is G: An individual with a graduate degree is more likely to vote than an individual who has only a high school diploma.
