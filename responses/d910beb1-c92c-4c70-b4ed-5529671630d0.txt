Okay, so I have this question about the binary number system and how many digits it has. Hmm, I remember that binary is one of the fundamental number systems used in computing. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I recall that the term "binary" comes from "bi," meaning two. So, binary should have something to do with two. In the context of number systems, the digits used are based on the base of the system. For example, the decimal system we use every day is base 10 because it has ten digits: 0 through 9.

Wait, so if binary is base 2, that means it should have two digits. What are those digits? I think they are 0 and 1. Yeah, that's right. So each digit in a binary number can only be either 0 or 1. That makes sense because in computing, everything is based on switches that are either on or off, which correspond to 1 and 0.

Looking at the options provided, let's see:

A: 0 – That can't be right because binary definitely has digits.
B: 1 – No, because binary has two digits, not one.
C: 2 – Yes, that matches what I was thinking.
D: 10 – Wait, 10 is the base for decimal, not binary.

So the correct answer should be option C: 2.

The binary number system has two digits: 0 and 1. This corresponds to option C.
