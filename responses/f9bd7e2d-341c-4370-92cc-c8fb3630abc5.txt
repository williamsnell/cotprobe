Okay, so I have this question about publics according to Esman (1972), and I need to figure out the answer. Let me start by recalling what I know about publics in the context of organizational communication or public relations.

Esman's typology of publics categorizes them based on their relationship with the organization. I remember that he identified several types, each playing a different role. The question is asking which publics help an organization exist by lending authority or assistance. So, I'm looking for a type that provides support or enables the organization to function.

Let me go through the options one by one. The options are A to J, so I'll list them out as I think of each.

A: Collaborative – These might be partners or collaborators who work together on projects. They contribute through their work, but does that include lending authority?

B: Enabling – This sounds like it could be the right fit. Enabling publics provide resources or support that enable the organization to exist. Maybe they supply funding, services, or other necessary assistance.

C: Strategic – These are likely long-term partners with mutual goals. They might align with the organization's strategy but not necessarily provide authority or assistance for existence.

D: Operational – These would be involved in day-to-day operations. They might be suppliers or service providers, but I'm not sure if that's the same as lending authority.

E: Normative – These are publics that set norms or standards. They might influence how the organization behaves but not directly support its existence through authority or assistance.

F: Regulatory – These are government bodies or official regulators. They provide oversight and ensure compliance, which is important, but do they lend authority? Or do they enforce it?

G: Diffused – These are widespread, less organized publics. They might be the general public or customers, but they don't necessarily help the organization exist by lending authority.

H: Functional – Similar to operational, they might be involved in specific functions but not necessarily providing authority support.

I: Financial – These would be investors or financial institutions. They provide funds, which is crucial, but is that the same as lending authority?

J: Administrative – These could be those involved in the administrative functions, like boards or advisors. They provide oversight and perhaps authority, but I'm not sure if that's the primary role.

So, going back to the question, it's about publics that help the organization exist by lending authority or assistance. Enabling (B) seems to fit because enabling publics are those that provide the necessary support or resources, which can include both financial and other forms of assistance. They enable the organization to function and exist. 

Financial (I) is also a possibility because financial institutions provide funds, but the term "enabling" seems broader and includes more than just financial support. It could encompass other types of assistance beyond money.

Wait, I should make sure I'm not mixing up enabling with other categories. Let me think again. Enabling publics are those that facilitate the organization's existence by providing necessary support, which can include resources, services, or even permissions. This could include financial institutions, suppliers, or even certain regulatory bodies that make it possible for the organization to operate.

Yes, I think B: Enabling is the correct answer because it's about the publics that support the organization's existence through various means, including authority or assistance.

The correct answer is B: Enabling. These publics provide the necessary support or resources that enable the organization to exist, including both financial and other forms of assistance. 

Answer: B
