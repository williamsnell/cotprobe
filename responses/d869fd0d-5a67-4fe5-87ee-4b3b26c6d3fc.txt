Okay, so I have this question about an African butterfly species that exists in two strikingly different color patterns. The question is asking which evolutionary mechanism describes this situation. The options are A through J, which include various selection types and other evolutionary concepts.

First, I need to understand what each option refers to. Let's go through them one by one.

Option A: Directional selection. That's when natural selection favors one extreme of a trait over the others. So, for example, if a population has a range of beak sizes and a new environment favors larger beaks, directional selection would lead to an increase in the average beak size over time.

Option B: Natural selection. This is the general process where traits that improve survival and reproduction become more common in a population. It's not specific to a type of selection but the broader mechanism.

Option C: Artificial selection. This is when humans actively select for certain traits in domesticated species, like breeding dogs for specific features.

Option D: Divergent selection. This occurs when different environments favor different traits, leading to divergence in the population. So, if two groups of a species are in different habitats, each might evolve different traits suited to their environment.

Option E: Convergent evolution. This is when unrelated species independently develop similar traits because they're adapting to similar environments. Like how dolphins and sharks both have fins for swimming.

Option F: Genetic drift. This is a random change in allele frequencies, especially in small populations, that isn't due to selection.

Option G: Balanced selection. This maintains multiple alleles at a locus in the population, often through heterozygote advantage or other balancing mechanisms.

Option H: Stabilizing selection. This favors the average trait, reducing variation. It's like if a trait's extremes are less fit, so the population becomes more uniform.

Option I: Disruptive selection. This is the opposite of stabilizing; it favors extreme traits, increasing variation. If being at either end of a trait distribution is better, the population becomes more diverse in that trait.

Option J: Sexual selection. This is when traits evolve because they increase an organism's chances of obtaining a mate, often leading to traits like peacock tails.

The question is about a butterfly with two different color patterns. So, the species must have two distinct forms that are maintained in the population. I'm thinking that this might be an example of disruptive selection because it increases the variation in the population. Alternatively, it might be divergent selection if the two color patterns are due to different environments favoring different traits.

Wait, but divergent selection is when different environments lead to different traits. If the same species has two color patterns because they're in different habitats, that's divergent. But if it's within the same environment but for some other reason, like sexual selection, that's different.

Another thought: some butterflies have different color patterns for males and females, which would be sexual selection. Or maybe it's a case where the two color forms are maintained because each has some advantage in different ecological conditions, which would be divergent selection.

But the question says "exists in two strikingly different color patterns" without specifying if they're in different environments or for different purposes like mating. So, if the two patterns are maintained because each is advantageous in different contexts, that could be either divergent or disruptive selection.

Alternatively, if the two patterns are maintained because each has some selective advantage, perhaps disruptive selection is at play. For example, maybe one pattern is better for camouflage in one habitat, and another pattern in another, but the same butterfly species can be found in both areas. That would be divergent selection.

Wait, but the question is about the species as a whole having two different patterns. Maybe it's a case of polymorphism, where the species has multiple forms. If the two patterns are maintained because each is favored in different parts of the range, that's divergent selection. Alternatively, if the selection within each part of the range is pushing towards different extremes, that's also divergent.

Alternatively, if the two patterns are maintained because each is advantageous in some way, perhaps in different microhabitats or for different purposes like mimicry, that might be disruptive selection.

Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. Disruptive selection increases the frequency of extreme traits, leading to a bimodal distribution. So if the butterfly has two very different color patterns, and each is favored over intermediate forms, that's disruptive selection.

But wait, another possibility is that the two patterns are maintained by different selective pressures, like different predators or habitats, which would be divergent selection.

I think the key here is that the species has two distinct patterns. If the two patterns are maintained because each is favored in different environments (like one for a dense forest and another for an open savanna), that's divergent selection. But if the same environment allows for both because they serve different functions (like male and female coloration), that might be sexual selection.

But the question doesn't specify the reason, just that the species has two different color patterns. So, in evolutionary terms, when a population splits into two or maintains two forms due to different selective pressures, it's divergent selection.

Wait, but divergent selection is a type of natural selection. So the broader process is natural selection, but the specific type here is divergent.

Alternatively, if the two color patterns are maintained because each is better in some aspect, perhaps it's a case of disruptive selection. For example, if having a certain color makes it harder for predators to detect, and another color might be better for attracting mates, but that's more about sexual selection.

Wait, perhaps the answer is I: Disruptive selection. Because it's maintaining two distinct forms by favoring the extremes, leading to a split in the population.

Alternatively, I'm not entirely sure. Let me think of examples. The peppered moth is often cited with directional selection, but there are other examples. For instance, some fish have different color patterns based on environment, which would be divergent selection.

Alternatively, think of mimicry: some butterflies have patterns that mimic others for protection. But that's more about natural selection favoring the mimicry.

Wait, another angle: the question is about the mechanism that describes the species having two different color patterns. If the two patterns are maintained because each is advantageous in different ways, perhaps due to sexual selection (like male peacocks), but in this case, it's about color patterns, which could be for camouflage or mating.

Alternatively, it's about the same species having two forms that are each favored in their own contexts, which would be either divergent or disruptive selection.

I think I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to match the options with the scenario:

- Directional selection (A): leads to a shift in the mean trait, not two distinct forms.

- Natural selection (B): general process, not specific mechanism.

- Artificial selection (C): human involvement, not applicable.

- Divergent selection (D): different traits favored in different environments, leading to divergence.

- Convergent evolution (E): unrelated species evolving similar traits.

- Genetic drift (F): random changes, unlikely to cause striking patterns.

- Balanced selection (G): maintains multiple alleles, but not necessarily different traits.

- Stabilizing selection (H): reduces variation, so less likely.

- Disruptive selection (I): increases variation, leading to two distinct forms.

- Sexual selection (J): traits for mating, could involve color, but not necessarily two forms unless it's for different sexes or something.

So, the question is about two strikingly different color patterns. If the species has two forms because each is favored in different environments, it's divergent selection. If each form is favored because they are extremes (e.g., one very bright, one very dull), it's disruptive selection.

But the question doesn't specify the reason, just that the species has two different color patterns. So which mechanism is more likely to produce such a scenario?

Divergent selection typically refers to different environments leading to different adaptations. So if the butterfly exists in two different habitats with different selective pressures, leading to two color patterns, that's divergent.

Alternatively, if the same environment has multiple selective pressures maintaining two forms, that's disruptive.

But the question says the butterfly exists in two patterns, not necessarily in two environments. So perhaps it's a case where within the same environment, the two patterns are maintained because each offers an advantage in different aspects, like predation and mating.

Wait, but if the two patterns are maintained because each is better in some aspect, that could be disruptive selection. For example, if one pattern is better for males to attract mates, and another for females to avoid predators, that's disruptive.

Alternatively, maybe the two patterns are due to different ecological factors, which would be divergent.

I'm still a bit stuck. Let me think of an example. The African butterfly in question might be the African mocker swallowtail, which has different forms. Wait, I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, some butterflies have different seasonal forms, which might be due to different environmental pressures, like migration.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a case where the two color patterns are maintained because each is favored in different parts of the life cycle or for different functions.

But without more context, I need to choose the best fit.

The options are about the mechanism. The question is about two different color patterns existing in the same species. That suggests that the selection is maintaining both forms, which is either divergent or disruptive.

If the two forms are maintained because each is better in different environments (divergent), or because each is better in different aspects of the same environment (disruptive).

I think the answer is I: Disruptive selection, because it's about maintaining two distinct forms by favoring the extremes, leading to increased variation. Divergent selection is more about different environments leading to different adaptations, but the question doesn't specify separate environments.

Alternatively, the answer could be D: Divergent selection if the two patterns are due to different selection pressures in different contexts.

Wait, but the question doesn't specify that the two patterns are in different environments. So perhaps it's more about within the same environment, having two different traits favored, which would be disruptive selection.

Hmm, I'm still not entirely sure, but I think the correct answer is I: Disruptive selection.

The question asks which evolutionary mechanism describes an African butterfly species with two strikingly different color patterns. To determine the correct answer, each option was analyzed in the context of the scenario:

- **Directional selection (A)** favors one extreme trait, leading to a shift in the mean trait, which does not fit the description of two distinct patterns.
- **Natural selection (B)** is a broad process but does not specify the mechanism for maintaining two patterns.
- **Artificial selection (C)** involves human intervention, which is irrelevant here.
- **Divergent selection (D)** occurs when different environments favor different traits, leading to divergence. This could apply if the butterfly exists in different habitats with distinct selective pressures.
- **Convergent evolution (E)** involves unrelated species evolving similar traits, which is not applicable.
- **Genetic drift (F)** is a random process and unlikely to produce striking patterns.
- **Balanced selection (G)** maintains multiple alleles but does not explain distinct color patterns.
- **Stabilizing selection (H)** reduces variation, so it is unlikely to maintain two distinct forms.
- **Disruptive selection (I)** increases variation by favoring extreme traits, potentially leading to two distinct forms.
- **Sexual selection (J)** involves traits for mating, but the question does not specify a link to mating.

The question does not specify whether the two patterns are due to different environments or functions. However, **disruptive selection (I)** is more likely to maintain two distinct forms by favoring extremes, even within the same environment. This aligns with the scenario of two strikingly different color patterns.
