Question:

What is an EPSP? What is an IPSP? How do they affect a nerve cell's excitability?

Options:

A: EPSP and IPSP are types of nerve cells.
B: Both EPSP and IPSP reduce the likelihood of a nerve cell reaching threshold and firing an action potential.
C: EPSP and IPSP are neurotransmitters released by glial cells that do not directly affect nerve cells.
D: EPSP refers to a nerve cell's energy production surge, while IPSP refers to its energy conservation state.
E: EPSP is an inhibitory postsynaptic potential and IPSP is an excitatory postsynaptic potential.
F: An EPSP is a permanent change in nerve cell excitability, while an IPSP is a temporary change that lasts only a few seconds.
G: An EPSP is an excitatory postsynaptic potential making a nerve cell more likely to fire and an IPSP is an inhibitory post synaptic potential making it less likely to fire.
H: EPSP is a protein that enhances nerve growth, and IPSP is a molecule that prevents nerve growth.
I: EPSP increases a nerve cell's excitability by decreasing its membrane potential, while IPSP decreases excitability by increasing the membrane potential.
J: EPSP and IPSP do not affect a nerve cell's excitability.

Okay, so I've got this question about EPSP and IPSP and how they affect nerve cell excitability. Hmm, I remember from my biology class that these terms relate to how neurons communicate with each other. Let me think.

EPSP stands for excitatory postsynaptic potential, and IPSP is inhibitory postsynaptic potential. Right, so when a neuron sends a signal, it releases neurotransmitters. Depending on the type of neurotransmitter, it can either excite or inhibit the next neuron.

So, an excitatory postsynaptic potential would make the receiving neuron more likely to fire an action potential. Because when the EPSP happens, it lowers the threshold needed for the next cell to depolarize. That means the cell is more excited, so more likely to send a signal.

On the other hand, an inhibitory postsynaptic potential does the opposite. It raises the threshold, making it harder for the neuron to reach the necessary voltage for an action potential. So the cell is less likely to fire.

Looking at the options, let's go through them one by one.

Option A says they're types of nerve cells. No, that's not right. They're potentials, not cells.

Option B says both reduce the likelihood. That's wrong because EPSP increases it, IPSP decreases it.

Option C mentions neurotransmitters from glial cells. No, they're released by neurons, not glial cells, and they are potentials, not neurotransmitters.

Option D talks about energy production. Doesn't seem right; it's about membrane potentials, not energy.

Option E says EPSP is inhibitory and IPSP is excitatory. Wait, that's the opposite of what I know. No, EPSP is excitatory, so E is incorrect.

Option F says EPSP is permanent and IPSP is temporary. I don't think so. Both are temporary changes in the membrane potential, lasting milliseconds.

Option G: EPSP is excitatory, making firing more likely, and IPSP inhibitory, making it less likely. That matches what I was thinking. So G seems correct.

Option H refers to proteins and molecules related to nerve growth. Not related to EPSP/IPSP in terms of excitability.

Option I says EPSP decreases membrane potential and IPSP increases it. Wait, no. EPSP is when the membrane potential becomes more positive (depolarized), which is excitatory. IPSP makes it more negative (hyperpolarized), so it's the opposite of what I said. So I is wrong.

Option J says they don't affect excitability. No, they directly influence it.

So putting it all together, the correct answer is G.

The correct answer is G: An EPSP is an excitatory postsynaptic potential making a nerve cell more likely to fire, while an IPSP is an inhibitory postsynaptic potential making it less likely to fire.

Answer: G
