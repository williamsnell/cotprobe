Question:

A defendant is on trial for possession of heroin. During the prosecution's case-in-chief, a police officer testifies that he watched another officer seize a bag of white powder from the defendant and seal it in an envelope, which both officers initialed and dated and then placed in the police property room. The prosecutor then calls a chemist to testify that she obtained, intact from the property room, the dated, sealed envelope with the initials of both police officers, whose handwriting she recognized police officers, whose handwriting she recognized from previous experience, and that testing disclosed that the powder therein was heroin. The defendant argues that the prosecutor has not sufficiently authenticated the powder tested by the chemist as the powder that was seized from the defendant. Is the chemist's testimony admissible?

Options:

A: No, unless the envelope and powder are produced in court or their absence is explained.
B: Yes, because the chemist's recognition of the officers' handwriting is sufficient authentication.
C: No, because the chemist did not personally witness the seizure of the powder.
D: No, because the chemist did not directly receive the envelope from the police officers.
E: Yes, because the powder is sufficiently identified as having come from the defendant.
F: Yes, because an object in official custody is self-authenticating.
G: Yes, because the envelope was properly sealed and initialed by the officers.
H: No, because the chemist lacks firsthand knowledge that the powder came from the defendant.
I: No, because there is no proof that the powder in the envelope is the same powder that was seized.

Okay, so I've got this evidence question about the admissibility of a chemist's testimony regarding heroin possession. Let me try to break it down step by step.

So, the scenario is a defendant on trial for heroin possession. During the prosecution's case, a police officer testifies that he saw another officer seize a bag of white powder from the defendant. They sealed it in an envelope, both initialed and dated it, and placed it in the police property room. Then the prosecutor calls a chemist to testify. The chemist says she obtained the envelope from the property room; it's intact, properly sealed with initials and date, and she recognized the officers' handwriting from previous experience. Testing showed the powder was heroin. The defendant argues the prosecution hasn't authenticated the powder as the one seized.

The question is whether the chemist's testimony is admissible. I need to determine if the evidence was sufficiently authenticated under the rules of evidence.

I'm a bit rusty on evidence law, but I remember that authentication is a key requirement for admissibility. Authentication means proving that an item is what it's claimed to be. For physical evidence like this, the chain of custody is important, but sometimes other methods like identification can suffice.

So, the chemist didn't witness the seizure herself. She got the envelope from the property room. The officers sealed it, initialed and dated it. The chemist recognized their handwriting, which she knew from previous experience. So she can say the envelope is the same one handled by those officers.

But does that prove the powder inside is the same as what was seized? I think about the chain of custody. Typically, to authenticate an item, you need to show that it hasn't been tampered with and that it's the same as when it was seized. The officers sealed it properly, and the chemist saw that the envelope was intact. That suggests no tampering, so the powder is probably the same as what was seized.

Wait, but the chemist didn't see the seizure happen. She just knows the officers' handwriting. Is that enough? I think yes because the officers' initials and the date, along with the intact envelope, create a reliable chain. The chemist can identify the envelope as the one handled by the officers, and thus the powder inside is the same as what was seized.

Looking at the options:

Option A says the testimony isn't admissible unless the envelope is produced or the absence explained. But the chemist did obtain the envelope from the property room, so it's not clear why it's not produced. Maybe it's not necessary if the chain is solid.

Option B says yes because the chemist recognized the handwriting. That seems relevant but maybe not enough on its own.

Option C says no because the chemist didn't witness the seizure. But they don't need firsthand knowledge if the chain is good.

Option D says no because she didn't get the envelope directly from the officers. But the fact that she got it from the property room, which was handled properly, should be sufficient.

Option E says yes because the powder is identified as coming from the defendant. That sounds like it's relying on the chain, which might be correct.

Option F says yes because it's in official custody, making it self-authenticating. I'm not sure if that's a correct rule. I think some items in official custody can be self-authenticating, like business records, but I'm not sure about a police property envelope. Maybe not.

Option G says yes because the envelope was properly sealed and initialed. That sounds correct because those steps help show no tampering and proper handling.

Option H says no because the chemist lacks firsthand knowledge. But she has enough circumstantial evidence through the chain.

Option I says no because there's no proof the powder is the same as seized. But the chain of custody and proper sealing should provide that proof.

So, putting this together, the chemist's testimony should be admissible because the chain of custody is sufficiently established. The envelope was properly sealed, initialed, and the chemist can authenticate the officers' handwriting. Therefore, G seems correct, but I'm also considering E and F.

Wait, F says it's self-authenticating because it's in official custody. I'm not sure if that's the case here. The envelope is in the police property room, which is official custody, but does that make it self-authenticating? Maybe not necessarily, because someone's still needed to authenticate it. The chemist's testimony about the initials and sealing likely provides the necessary authentication.

So, between G and E. E says the powder is sufficiently identified as from the defendant. G says yes because of the proper sealing and initials. I think G is more about the method of authentication, while E is about identification. The key here is that the method (sealed envelope with initials) is sufficient for authentication. So G seems correct.

The chemist's testimony is admissible because the envelope was properly sealed and initialed by the officers, which establishes a sufficient chain of custody and authentication. The chemist's recognition of the officers' handwriting corroborates the integrity of the evidence. 

Answer: G
