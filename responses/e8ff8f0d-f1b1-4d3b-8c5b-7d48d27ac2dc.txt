Alright, so I've got this question about exchange rates and the price of a Big Mac in different countries. I need to figure out where the Big Mac is the most expensive. Let me break it down step by step.

First, let me list out the given information. The exchange rates are:

- 0.5 British Pounds per dollar. So that means 1 dollar = 0.5 GBP. Wait, no, wait. Actually, exchange rates are usually expressed as how much of the foreign currency you get per unit of your currency. So if it's 0.5 GBP per dollar, that would mean 1 dollar buys you 0.5 GBP. Wait, that seems a bit low. Wait, no, no, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Because usually, when you see exchange rates, it's like USD to GBP. So if the rate is 0.5 GBP per dollar, that means 1 USD = 0.5 GBP. So actually, the pound is weaker than the dollar in this case because you get fewer pounds per dollar. Or wait, no, maybe I'm mixing it up. Wait, no, if 1 USD buys you 0.5 GBP, that means GBP is weaker because each dollar can buy more pounds. Wait, no, that can't be right. Maybe I'm getting confused with the direction. Let me think: If the exchange rate is 0.5 GBP per USD, that's the same as 1 USD = 0.5 GBP. So that would mean that the GBP is weaker, because you need more GBP to make a dollar. So, for example, if I have 2 GBP, that's only 1 USD because 2 * 0.5 = 1. So yeah, that makes sense.

Next, 10 Mexican Pesos per dollar. So 1 USD = 10 MXN. That's straightforward.

Then, 100 Chinese Yuan per dollar, so 1 USD = 100 CNY.

Now, the price of a Big Mac in each country:

- America: $3.
- England: 2 pounds.
- Mexico: 50 pesos.
- China: 200 yuan.

The question is asking in which country the Big Mac is most expensive. So I need to convert each price into dollars to compare them.

Let's start with America: It's already in dollars, so $3. That's straightforward.

England: The Big Mac costs 2 pounds. I need to convert pounds to dollars. Since 1 USD = 0.5 GBP, that means 1 GBP = 2 USD. Wait, no, let me think again. Wait, if 1 USD = 0.5 GBP, then each GBP is worth 2 USD. So 1 GBP = 2 USD. So if something costs 2 GBP, that would be 2 * 2 USD = $4. So in England, the Big Mac costs $4 when converted to dollars.

Mexico: The Big Mac is 50 pesos. Since 1 USD = 10 MXN, then 50 MXN would be 50 / 10 = $5. So in Mexico, it's $5.

China: The Big Mac is 200 yuan. With 1 USD = 100 CNY, that's 200 / 100 = $2. So in China, it's $2.

Now, let's list all the converted prices:

- America: $3
- England: $4
- Mexico: $5
- China: $2

Comparing these, the most expensive is Mexico at $5. So the answer should be option C, Mexico ($5).

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

For England: 2 GBP. Since 1 USD = 0.5 GBP, then 1 GBP = 2 USD. So 2 GBP is 2 * 2 = 4 USD. Correct.

Mexico: 50 MXN. 10 MXN = 1 USD, so 50 /10 =5 USD. Correct.

China: 200 CNY. 100 CNY =1 USD, so 200 /100=2 USD. Correct.

So yes, Mexico is the most expensive at $5. So the correct answer is option C.

The Big Mac is most expensive in Mexico at $5 when converted to dollars.
