Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a capacitor, and I'm a bit rusty on my concepts, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem states: A 30 mF capacitor has 6 millicoulombs of charge on each plate. The energy stored in the capacitor is most nearly... and then there are several options given.

Alright, first, I remember that a capacitor stores energy, and there's a specific formula for calculating that energy. I think the formula involves the capacitance and the charge or voltage. Hmm. Wait, I think there are two main formulas for the energy stored in a capacitor. One is using charge, and the other uses voltage. Let me try to recall them.

I think one formula is U = (1/2) * C * V², where U is the energy, C is capacitance, and V is voltage. Another formula is U = Q² / (2C), where Q is the charge. Both formulas are correct because they're related; since Q = C * V, I can derive one from the other.

In this problem, I'm given the capacitance C as 30 mF. Wait, mF is millifarads, right? So 30 mF is 30 x 10^-3 farads. And the charge Q is 6 millicoulombs, which is 6 x 10^-3 coulombs.

So I can use the formula U = Q² / (2C). That should work because I have Q and C. Let me plug in the numbers.

First, calculate Q squared. Q is 6 x 10^-3 C, so Q squared is (6e-3)^2. Let me compute that: 6 squared is 36, and (10^-3)^2 is 10^-6. So Q² is 36 x 10^-6, which is 3.6e-5? Wait, no, 36 x 10^-6 is 3.6 x 10^-5? Wait, no, 36e-6 is 0.000036, which is 3.6 x 10^-5. Hmm, maybe I should write it as 36e-6 for calculation.

Then, the denominator is 2C. C is 30e-3 farads. So 2C is 2 * 30e-3 = 60e-3 or 0.06 farads.

So putting it all together, U = (36e-6) / (2 * 30e-3) * 0.5? Wait, no, wait. The formula is U = Q²/(2C). So actually, it's (36e-6) / (2 * 30e-3). Let me compute the denominator first: 2 * 30e-3 = 60e-3 = 0.06 F.

So U = 36e-6 / 0.06. Let me compute that. 36e-6 divided by 0.06.

Wait, 36e-6 is 0.000036, and 0.06 is 0.06. So 0.000036 divided by 0.06 equals... Let's see. 0.06 is 6e-2. So 36e-6 divided by 6e-2 is (36/6) * (1e-6 / 1e-2) = 6 * 1e-4, since 1e-6 divided by 1e-2 is 1e-4. So 6e-4 is 0.0006 J.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations. Alternatively, I can convert 36e-6 to 3.6e-5. So 3.6e-5 divided by 0.06:

3.6e-5 / 0.06 = (3.6 / 0.06) * 1e-5.

3.6 divided by 0.06 is 60, because 0.06 * 60 = 3.6. So 60 * 1e-5 is 6e-4, which is 0.0006 J. So U is 0.0006 joules.

Looking at the options, let's see: the options are A: 9e-8, B: 2 J, C: 2.7e-9, D:0.6 J, E:1.2 J, F:12.5 J, G:4.5e-8, H:7.5 J, I:5.4e-10, J:0.3 J.

Wait, my calculation gives 0.0006 J, which is 6e-4 J. But none of the options are exactly that. Wait, let me check again because maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, wait, maybe I messed up the exponents. Let me compute it again more carefully.

Q is 6e-3 C. So Q squared is (6e-3)^2 = 36e-6 C². 36e-6 is 3.6e-5, right?

C is 30e-3 F. So 2C is 60e-3 F.

So U = (36e-6) / (60e-3) = (36e-6) / (6e-2) = (36 / 6) * (1e-6 / 1e-2) )= 6 * 1e-4 = 6e-4 J. So 0.0006 J, which is 6e-4 J.

Looking back at the options, none of the letters have 6e-4 J, which is 0.0006 J. Hmm. Let me check the options again.

Option J is 0.3 J. That's 3e-1 J, which is way bigger than what I got. Option D is 0.6 J, which is 6e-1 J. That's ten times larger than my result. Option E is 1.2 J, which is even bigger. Hmm, am I missing a factor of 1/2 somewhere?

Wait, wait a minute. I think I might have missed a part of the formula. Let me reconsider the formula.

The correct formula for energy stored in a capacitor is U = (1/2) * C * V², or alternatively, U = (Q²)/(2C). Oh! I forgot the 1/2 factor in my calculation. Oops, that's a big mistake.

So let me recalculate using the correct formula: U = (Q²)/(2C).

So Q is 6e-3 C. So Q squared is (6e-3)^2 = 36e-6 C².

2C is 2 * 30e-3 = 60e-3 F.

So U = (36e-6) / (60e-3 * 2). Wait no, wait. The formula is (Q^2)/(2C). So it's (36e-6) / (2 * 30e-3) ) * (1/2)? No, no, wait. No, the denominator is 2C, so 2*30e-3 is 60e-3.

So U = (36e-6) / (60e-3) ) * (1/2). Wait, no, no, no, no. Wait, no. The formula is U = Q²/(2C). So I have Q²=36e-6, and 2C=60e-3.

So U = (36e-6) / (60e-3) ) * (1/2) ? No, wait, wait. No, no. Wait, no. The formula is U = (Q^2)/(2C), so it's (36e-6) divided by (2*30e-3), which is (36e-6)/(60e-3) = 6e-4 J. But I just realized that the formula already includes the 1/2, so I don't need to multiply by 1/2 again. Wait, no, I think I'm getting confused.

Wait, the formula is U = (1/2) * C * V². Alternatively, U = (Q²)/(2C). So the denominator includes the 2. So in this case, I have Q²/(2C), which is (36e-6)/(60e-3) = 6e-4 J, which is 0.0006 J.

Wait, but that's what I got before. So 0.0006 J is 6e-4 J. Now looking at the options, let's see which is closest.

Looking at the options again:

A: 9e-8 J (0.00000009 J) → way too small.

B: 2 J → too big.

C: 2.7e-9 J → way too small.

D: 0.6 J → 6e-1 J, which is 10 times bigger than 6e-4.

E:1.2 J → even bigger.

F:12.5 J → way too big.

G:4.5e-8 J → too small.

H:7.5 J → way too big.

I:5.4e-10 J → way too small.

J:0.3 J → 3e-1 J, which is 500 times bigger than 6e-4.

Hmm, none of the options are 6e-4 J. Am I making a mistake in the calculation? Let me check another approach.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute the voltage first and then use the other formula U = ½ C V².

Since Q = C * V, so V = Q/C.

Q is 6e-3 C, C is 30e-3 F.

So V = (6e-3)/(30e-3) = (6/30) = 0.2 volts.

Now, using U = ½ C V² = 0.5 * 30e-3 F * (0.2)^2.

(0.2)^2 is 0.04.

So U = 0.5 * 30e-3 * 0.04.

0.5 * 30e-3 is 15e-3.

15e-3 * 0.04 = 0.0006 J, which is the same as before. So that's 6e-4 J.

Hmm. So why is none of the options matching this? Maybe I made a mistake in the exponents or in the initial values.

Wait, let me check the values again.

Capacitance is 30 mF → 30 x 10^-3 F = 0.03 F.

Charge is 6 mC → 6 x 10^-3 C.

So Q is 6e-3, C is 30e-3.

So U = (6e-3)^2 / (2 * 30e-3) = (36e-6) / (60e-3) = (36e-6) / (0.06) = 6e-4 J.

Wait, 36e-6 / 60e-3 is equal to (36/60) * (1e-6 / 1e-3) )= 0.6 * 1e-3 = 6e-4.

So 6e-4 J is 0.0006 J. But looking at the options, the closest is option J: 0.3 J, which is 0.3 J. Hmm, that's 3e-1, which is 500 times larger than 6e-4. That can't be right. So maybe I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait another thought: Did I maybe mix up micro and milli somewhere? Let me check the units again.

The question says 30 mF (millifarads), which is correct as 30e-3 F. The charge is 6 mC (millicoulombs), which is 6e-3 C. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the formula. Let me double-check the formula for stored energy. The formula is definitely U = (1/2) C V², or U = Q²/(2C). Both are correct. So I think my approach is correct, but perhaps I made an error in calculation.

Wait, let me compute 36e-6 / (60e-3) again.

36e-6 is 0.000036.

60e-3 is 0.06.

So 0.000036 divided by 0.06 is 0.000036 / 0.06 = 0.0006.

Yes, that's correct.

Hmm. So the answer is 0.0006 J, which is 6e-4 J. But none of the options match that. Let me look again at the options.

Looking at the options, option J is 0.3 J, which is 0.3. That's 500 times bigger. Option D is 0.6 J, which is 10 times bigger than 0.0006. Option E is 1.2 J, which is even larger.

Wait, could I have made a mistake in the exponents when calculating Q squared? Let me recalculate (6e-3)^2.

6e-3 is 0.006. Squaring that: 0.006^2 = 0.000036, which is 3.6e-5, not 36e-6. Wait a second, that's a mistake! Oh no! I think I messed up the exponent when computing Q squared.

Wait, 6e-3 is 6 x 10^-3. Squared, it's (6)^2 x (10^-3)^2 = 36 x 10^-6, which is 36e-6. So that's correct. So 36e-6 is 3.6e-5. Hmm, no, 36e-6 is 36 x 10^-6, which is 0.000036, correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the denominator. Let me compute 2C again. C is 30e-3 F, so 2C is 60e-3 F, which is 0.06 F. Correct.

So (36e-6) divided by 0.06 is 0.0006 J. So 6e-4 J.

But none of the options match. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Alternatively, maybe the question says 30 microfarads instead of millifarads? Let me check.

The question states 30 mF, so 30 millifarads, which is correct. So 30e-3 F.

Wait, perhaps the charge is 6 coulombs, but no, the question says 6 mC. So 6e-3 C.

Hmm. Maybe the formula I used is wrong. Alternatively, maybe I should have used the other formula, U = ½ C V².

Let me compute V again. V = Q/C. So Q is 6e-3 C, C is 30e-3 F.

So V = (6e-3) / (30e-3) = 0.2 V.

Then, U = ½ * C * V² = 0.5 * 30e-3 F * (0.2)^2.

0.2 squared is 0.04.

So 0.5 * 30e-3 = 15e-3.

15e-3 * 0.04 = 0.0006 J, same as before.

Hmm. So the answer is 0.0006 J, which is 6e-4 J.

Looking back at the options, the closest one would be none, but maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should check the calculation using exponents more carefully.

36e-6 divided by 60e-3 equals (36e-6) / (60e-3) = (36/60) * (1e-6 / 1e-3) = 0.6 * 1e-3 = 0.6e-3 = 6e-4 J. So that's correct.

Wait, but the options don't have 6e-4 J. So perhaps I made a mistake in the problem's units. Let me check the problem again.

Wait, the problem says 30 mF (millifarads) and 6 mC (millicoulombs). So 30e-3 F and 6e-3 C.

Wait, maybe I should convert everything into base units to see if I'm making a mistake.

Wait, another approach: Let me compute the energy in joules using correct units.

Energy U = (Q^2)/(2C).

Q is 6 mC → 6e-3 C.

C is 30 mF →30e-3 F.

So Q² = (6e-3)^2 = 36e-6 C².

2C = 60e-3 F.

So U = 36e-6 / 60e-3 = (36e-6) / (6e-2) )

Because 60e-3 is 6e-2? Wait, no. 60e-3 is 0.06, which is 6e-2. Wait, no, 60e-3 is 6e-2? Wait 60e-3 is 0.06, which is 6e-2? No, 6e-2 is 0.06. Oh wait, yes. 60e-3 is 6e-2. Because 60e-3 = 60 x 1e-3 = 6 x 1e-2 = 0.06.

So 36e-6 / 6e-2 = (36 / 6) * (1e-6 / 1e-2) )= 6 * 1e-4 = 6e-4 J. So that's correct.

Hmm. So the correct answer is 6e-4 J, which is 0.0006 J. But none of the options match. So perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the question.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the capacitor has 6 mC on each plate, but sometimes capacitors have equal and opposite charges, but the magnitude is 6 mC. So the charge per plate is 6 mC, but perhaps the formula uses the total charge or the difference. Wait, no, the formula uses the charge on one plate, since Q is the charge on each plate.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that each plate has 6 mC, so the total charge is 12 mC? No, that can't be right because the formula uses the charge on one plate. No, because the capacitor's charge is the magnitude on each plate. So I'm confident that Q is 6e-3 C.

Wait, perhaps the problem is written incorrectly, but assuming the problem is correct, maybe I made a mistake in the exponents.

Wait, 6e-3 squared is 36e-6. Divided by 60e-3 gives 36e-6 / 60e-3 = 0.0006 J. So 6e-4 J.

Looking at the options, perhaps none of them are correct, but since the closest is option J: 0.3 J, but that's way off. Alternatively, perhaps I should check if I used the correct formula.

Wait, another thought: Did I mix up the formula? Let me think: Maybe I should use Q = CV, so V = Q/C, then U = ½ CV². So using V = (6e-3)/(30e-3) = 0.2 V. Then U = ½ * 30e-3 * (0.2)^2.

So ½ *30e-3 is 15e-3. (0.2)^2 is 0.04. 15e-3 * 0.04 = 0.0006 J. Same result.

Hmm. I'm starting to think that perhaps the options are wrong, but that's unlikely. Or maybe I made a calculation mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it as 36e-6 / 6e-2.

36e-6 is 3.6e-5.

6e-2 is 0.06.

So 3.6e-5 / 0.06 = (3.6 / 0.06) * 1e-5.

3.6 divided by 0.06 is 60. So 60e-5 is 6e-4, which is 0.0006 J.

Hmm. So I'm confident that the correct answer is 0.0006 J, which is 6e-4 J. But the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the problem's parameters.

Wait, another possibility: Did the problem state 30 mF or 30 μF (microfarads)? Because 30 μF would be 30e-6 F, which would change the calculation significantly.

Wait, the problem says 30 mF. So 30e-3 F. If it were 30 μF, it would be 30e-6 F.

Wait, let me quickly check what the energy would be if C were 30 μF.

If C were 30e-6 F, then U = (6e-3)^2/(2*30e-6) ) = 36e-6 / (60e-6) )= 0.6 J.

That would match option D: 0.6 J.

But the problem says 30 mF, not μF. So unless I misread the question, which I should double-check.

The question says: "A 30 mF capacitor has 6 millicoulombs of charge on each plate."

Yes, mF, not μF.

So unless I made a mistake in the exponents, perhaps the correct answer is 0.0006 J, but that's not among the options. Alternatively, maybe I should check the options again.

Wait, looking at the options again, option J is 0.3 J. That's 3e-1 J.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation and the correct answer is 0.0006 J, which is 6e-4 J. But none of the options match. So perhaps the intended answer is option J: 0.3 J, which is 3e-1 J, but that's 500 times larger than what I calculated.

Wait, perhaps I should check if I used the correct formula, perhaps using Q as the total charge? No, because for a capacitor, the charge on each plate is Q, and the formula uses Q as the magnitude on each plate.

Wait, another thought: Maybe I should have used 6 mC as the total charge, but that's not the case. Because the capacitor has two plates, each with 6 mC, so the total charge is 12 mC. But in the formula, Q is the charge on one plate, so I'm correct in using 6 mC.

Alternatively, maybe the formula is U = Q * V, but that's not correct. The correct formula is U = ½ QV, which gives the same result as before.

Wait, let me compute U using U = ½ QV.

We have Q = 6e-3 C, V = 0.2 V.

So U = 0.5 * 6e-3 * 0.2 = 0.5 * 0.0012 = 0.0006 J. Same result.

Hmm. So perhaps the options are wrong, or I made a mistake. But since none of the options match, perhaps I should look for a calculation error.

Wait, another approach: Let's compute using Q in coulombs and C in farads.

Q = 6e-3 C.

C = 30e-3 F.

So Q² is (6e-3)^2 = 36e-6 C².

2C = 60e-3 F.

So U = 36e-6 / 60e-3 = (36e-6) / (6e-2) = (36/6) * (1e-6 / 1e-2) )= 6 * 1e-4 = 6e-4 J.

Yes, same result.

Since none of the options match, perhaps the intended answer is option J: 0.3 J, but that's way off. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the exponents.

Wait, perhaps I should write 6e-4 as 6 x 10^-4 J. Looking at the options again, option D is 0.6 J, which is 6e-1 J, ten times larger. Option J is 0.3 J, which is 3e-1 J.

Wait, could I have missed a factor of 10 somewhere? Let me check:

If I used 6e-4 J, which is 0.0006 J, which is 600 microjoules. Looking at the options, option A is 9e-8 J, which is 0.00000009 J, way smaller. Option C is 2.7e-9 J, even smaller. Option G is 4.5e-8 J, still smaller. So none of the options are close except perhaps option J, but it's 0.3 J, which is 500 times bigger.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the exponent when calculating Q squared. Let me check again.

(6e-3)^2 = 36e-6. Yes, correct.

Wait, another thought: Did I perhaps confuse milli with micro somewhere? Let me think.

If I had used 6 μC instead of 6 mC, then Q would be 6e-6 C. But the problem says 6 mC, so that's 6e-3 C.

Alternatively, if the capacitance were 30 μF, then C =30e-6 F, which would give a higher energy. Let me see:

If C were 30e-6 F, then U = (6e-3)^2 / (2 *30e-6) )= 36e-6 / (60e-6) )= 0.6 J, which is option D.

But the problem states 30 mF, so that's 30e-3 F. So I think I'm correct in my calculation.

But since the correct answer isn't among the options, perhaps the intended answer is option J: 0.3 J, but that's 0.3 J, which is 500 times bigger than what I got. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula, like using (Q)(V) instead of ½ QV.

Wait, if I had mistakenly used Q * V, then U would be 6e-3 * 0.2 = 0.0012 J, which is 1.2e-3 J. That's 0.0012 J, which is 1.2e-3 J. Looking at the options, option E is 1.2 J, which is much bigger. Option J is 0.3 J, which is 3e-1 J.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option J: 0.3 J, but I can't figure out how to get that from the given values. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express 6e-4 J in scientific notation. 6e-4 J is 0.0006 J, which is 6 x 10^-4 J. Looking at the options, option A is 9e-8, option C is 2.7e-9, option G is 4.5e-8. None of these are close to 6e-4.

Wait, perhaps I should check the formula again. The formula for energy stored is definitely U = (1/2) C V² or U = Q²/(2C). So I think I'm correct.

Wait, another angle: Maybe the question intended to say 30 μF instead of 30 mF? Let's try that.

If C is 30 μF =30e-6 F, and Q is 6e-3 C.

Then U = (6e-3)^2 / (2 *30e-6) )= (36e-6) / (60e-6) )= 0.6 J, which is option D.

So if the question had said 30 μF, the answer would be option D: 0.6 J. But the question says 30 mF, so that's 30e-3 F.

Alternatively, perhaps the question had a typo, and the intended answer is option J: 0.3 J. But I can't see how that would happen.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the calculation one more time.

Q=6e-3 C.

C=30e-3 F.

U= (6e-3)^2 / (2*30e-3) = (36e-6)/(60e-3) = (36e-6) / (6e-2) )= 6e-4 J.

Yes, correct.

So, since none of the options match, perhaps the intended answer is option J: 0.3 J, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the capacitor might be connected across a certain voltage, but the problem doesn't state that. It just gives Q and C. So I think my approach is correct.

In conclusion, based on the given values, the correct energy stored is 0.0006 J, which is 6e-4 J. Since this isn't among the options, perhaps the intended answer is option J: 0.3 J, but I can't see how that would be achieved with the given parameters. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation, but I've checked it several times and it seems correct.
</think>

The energy stored in a capacitor can be calculated using the formula \( U = \frac{Q^2}{2C} \), where \( Q \) is the charge and \( C \) is the capacitance. 

Given:
- \( Q = 6 \, \text{mC} = 6 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{C} \)
- \( C = 30 \, \text{mF} = 30 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{F} \)

First, calculate \( Q^2 \):
\[
Q^2 = (6 \times 10^{-3})^2 = 36 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{C}^2
\]

Next, calculate \( 2C \):
\[
2C = 2 \times 30 \times 10^{-3} = 60 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{F}
\]

Now, substitute into the formula:
\[
U = \frac{36 \times 10^{-6}}{60 \times 10^{-3}} = \frac{36}{60} \times 10^{-6 + 3} = 0.6 \times 10^{-3} = 6 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{J}
\]

Thus, the energy stored is \( 6 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{J} \), which is \( 0.0006 \, \text{J} \). However, none of the provided options match this value exactly. The closest option is **J: 0.3 J**, though it is significantly larger than the calculated result. Given the provided options, the most reasonable choice is:

**Answer: J**
