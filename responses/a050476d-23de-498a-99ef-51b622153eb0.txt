Alright, so I have this question about Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection, and I need to figure out which principle isn't part of it. Let me go through each option one by one.

First, the question is asking which is NOT part of Darwin's theory. So I need to remember what Darwin's theory entails. I know that natural selection is a key part, along with some other concepts like variation, competition, and gradual change over time.

Option A: Evolution does not occur within an individual's lifespan. Wait, that sounds familiar. I think Darwin believed that evolution happens over generations, not within a single lifetime. So this is part of his theory. So A is correct, meaning it's part of the theory, so it's not the answer we're looking for.

Option B: Natural selection favors traits that are beneficial for survival. Yeah, that's definitely Darwin. He said that traits that help survival and reproduction are more likely to be passed on. So B is correct, not the answer.

Option C: Evolution occurs in response to changes in the environment. Hmm, I'm a bit unsure here. I remember that natural selection is about differential survival and reproduction based on existing variation, not necessarily that the environment directly causes the changes. So evolution isn't really a response to the environment, but more about which traits are selected for. So maybe C is not part of Darwin's theory. But I'm not too sure yet; I'll keep this in mind.

Option D: Every population has tremendous variation. Darwin talked about variation within species, which is essential for natural selection. So D is correct and part of his theory.

Option E: Species can develop new traits during their lifetime, which they can pass on to their offspring. Wait, that doesn't sound right. I think Darwin didn't believe in the inheritance of acquired traits. So if a trait develops in an individual's lifetime, it usually isn't passed on. That's more like Lamarckism, which Darwin's theory doesn't support. So E is not part of Darwin's theory. Hmm, this is a possible answer.

Option F: Survival of the fittest ensures that only the strongest survive. This is a phrase associated with Darwin. Survival of the fittest is another way of saying natural selection, where the most fit individuals survive and reproduce. So F is correct, part of the theory.

Option G: Evolution is a gradual process that occurs over a long period of time. Yes, Darwin's theory is about gradual changes over deep time. So G is correct.

Option H: Every species has the potential to evolve. That makes sense because as long as there's variation and selection, species can evolve. So H is correct.

Option I: Organisms will overpopulate an area, giving rise to competition. This relates to Malthus's idea that populations grow geometrically but resources don't, leading to competition. Darwin was influenced by this, so I think I is part of his theory. So I is correct.

Option J: Mutations are the main source of all variation in a population. Wait, Darwin didn't know about mutations. He thought variation came from some other mechanism, maybe blending inheritance or other factors. The role of mutations came later with Mendel and genetic theories. So J is not part of Darwin's original theory. So J is incorrect.

Wait, so I have two possible answers: E and J. Let me think again.

E says species can develop new traits during their lifetime and pass them on. Darwin's theory doesn't support that because he didn't believe in the inheritance of acquired characteristics. So E is incorrect, part of the theory is not correct.

J says mutations are the main source of variation. Darwin didn't talk about mutations; he didn't know about genes or mutations. He thought variation arose somehow, but mutations were a later concept. So J is not part of his theory.

But the question is asking which is NOT part of Darwin's theory. So both E and J are incorrect parts. Wait, but the options are only one correct answer. Let me check the question again.

The options are A-J, and the question is which is NOT part.

Wait, another angle: Let me list what each option says.

Option E: Species can develop new traits during their lifetime, which they can pass on to their offspring. That's about acquired traits, which Darwin didn't include. So E is not part of his theory.

Option J: Mutations are the main source of all variation. Darwin's theory didn't include mutations as a source because he didn't know about them. He thought variation was due to other factors. So J is also not part of his theory.

Wait, but the question asks which is NOT part. So both E and J are incorrect. But looking back, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, maybe E is correct. Because in reality, some traits can be developed during the lifetime, but Darwin didn't think they were heritable. So E is not part of his theory because he didn't think that could happen. So E is the wrong principle.

Similarly, J is also not part because mutations weren't part of his theory.

Wait, but the options may have only one correct answer. Let me check the options again.

Wait, the options are A-J, and the correct answer is E or J.

Wait, the original question is asking which is NOT part of Darwin's theory.

Looking it up in my mind: Darwin's theory includes variation within populations, natural selection acting on that variation, leading to adaptation. He didn't believe in the inheritance of acquired traits, so E is incorrect. He also didn't know about mutations, which are a source of variation, so J is incorrect.

Wait, but the options are A-J. So looking for the one that's not part of his theory.

Option E: Species can develop new traits during their lifetime, which they can pass on. That would be like a giraffe stretching its neck, which Darwin thought might be possible, but modern science says that's not how it works. So E is not part of Darwin's theory because he didn't think that was a main mechanism. Or did he?

Wait, actually, I think Darwin did consider that some traits could be acquired and passed on, but modern understanding says that's incorrect. So E is not part of his theory because he didn't think that was a source of heritable variation. Wait, no, he did think that acquired traits could be inherited. I'm getting confused.

Wait, no. Let me clarify: Darwin's theory didn't include the inheritance of acquired characteristics. So E is stating that species can develop new traits during their lifetime and pass them on, which is incorrect because Darwin didn't think that was possible. So E is not part of his theory.

On the other hand, J says mutations are the main source of variation. Darwin didn't know about mutations, so in his theory, he didn't identify mutations as the cause. So J is also not part of his theory.

But the question is which one is NOT part. So I need to choose between E and J.

Wait, perhaps E is correct. Because in Darwin's time, he didn't have the concept of mutations, and he thought variation came from other sources. So E is incorrect because he didn't believe in the development of new traits during the individual's lifetime being inherited. So E is not part of his theory.

Alternatively, J is not part because he didn't talk about mutations.

Wait, the answer options include J as "Mutations are the main source of all variation in a population." Since Darwin didn't know about mutations, J is not part of his theory.

So the question is which is NOT part. So both E and J are not part of his theory, but the options likely have only one correct answer.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again.

The main points of Darwin's theory are:

- Variation exists within species.

- Organisms have the potential to overbreed, leading to competition.

- Natural selection acts on variation, favoring beneficial traits.

- Evolution is gradual over time.

- Traits are inherited, but not acquired traits (though he might have been influenced by the idea, but it's not a correct part of his theory).

So looking at the options:

A: Correct, evolution doesn't happen within a lifetime.

B: Correct, natural selection favors beneficial traits.

C: Incorrect because evolution isn't a response to the environment but a result of selection.

D: Correct, variation exists.

E: Incorrect because species can't develop new traits during their lifetime that are inherited.

F: Correct, survival of the fittest.

G: Correct, gradual process.

H: Correct, every species can evolve.

I: Correct, overpopulation leads to competition.

J: Incorrect, as mutations weren't part of his theory.

Wait, but the question is which is NOT part. So the incorrect ones are C, E, J.

But the options are only one correct answer. So perhaps the question is designed so that E is the correct answer because it's a common misconception that Darwin allowed for acquired traits.

Alternatively, J is also a correct answer because mutations are not part of his theory.

Wait, the options are A to J, and the question asks which is NOT part. So perhaps both E and J are not part. But the options are single choice.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is E, because in Darwin's theory, new traits that develop during an individual's lifetime are not passed on. So E is not part of his theory.

But the question is tricky because J is also not part. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the answer is E and J, but since I have to choose one, perhaps the intended answer is E.

Wait, looking back, the options are:

E: Species can develop new traits during their lifetime, which they can pass on to their offspring.

This is incorrect because Darwin didn't think that was possible. So E is not part of his theory.

J: Mutations are the main source of all variation. Darwin didn't know about mutations, so J is also not part of his theory.

But perhaps in the context of the question, the intended answer is E, as it's a more directly incorrect statement, while J is more about the mechanism of variation which wasn't part of his theory but is more of a later addition.

Alternatively, perhaps the question considers mutations as a source of variation, which is part of modern evolutionary theory but not Darwin's.

So, the options are to choose which is NOT part.

Looking at the options again:

The answer is E and J. But since I have to choose one, perhaps the intended answer is E.

Wait, but the correct answer according to the options is E and J. But the question expects one answer.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is E. Because the statement in E is incorrect as per Darwin's theory. Alternatively, J is also incorrect.

Wait, let me think about what each option says.

Option E: Species can develop new traits during their lifetime, which they can pass on to their offspring.

Darwin's theory says that variation arises from heritable factors, not from changes during the individual's lifetime. So E is incorrect.

Option J: Mutations are the main source of all variation in a population.

Darwin didn't know about mutations, so in his theory, variation was due to other causes, not mutations. So J is also incorrect.

But in the context of the options, perhaps the intended answer is E, because it's more directly about the mechanism of inheritance, whereas J is about the source of variation, which is a different aspect.

Wait, perhaps the question expects E as the answer.

But I'm getting stuck. Let me try to remember which of these options are definitely not part of Darwin's theory.

Option E is definitely not part because Darwin rejected the inheritance of acquired traits. So E is not part of his theory.

Option J is also not part because he didn't know about mutations.

But the question is asking which is NOT part, so the correct answer is either E or J.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is E because it's more directly related to the theory.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is E, and the answer is E.

Wait, but looking back, the options are A-J, and I think the correct answer is E.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.

If I have to choose, I'll go with E: Species can develop new traits during their lifetime, which they can pass on to their offspring. This is not part of Darwin's theory because he didn't believe in the inheritance of acquired characteristics. So E is the correct answer.

The question asks which principle is NOT part of Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection. Darwin's theory includes concepts like natural selection, variation within populations, gradual evolution over time, and competition due to overpopulation. He did not believe in the inheritance of acquired traits (E) or the role of mutations (J) as the main source of variation, as mutations were not understood during his time. However, the intended answer is likely **E**, as it directly contradicts Darwin's rejection of acquired traits being inherited.

Answer: E
