Okay, so I need to figure out which group the Leiter International Performance Scale is most useful for measuring intelligence. Let me think about what I know about the Leiter Scale.

I remember that the Leiter Scale is an intelligence test, but it's not like the regular ones. I think it's designed for people who can't take traditional tests, maybe because they have certain disabilities. Oh right, traditional tests often rely on verbal skills, so if someone has a speech impairment or is non-verbal, they can't take those tests. That's where the Leiter comes in.

Wait, the Leiter Scale uses performance-based assessments. That means it doesn't require talking or listening, which is great for people who have speech impairments or hearing issues. So it's more about visual and motor tasks. I think it's used for children and adults who can't do standard tests because of their impairments.

Looking at the options, let's go through them one by one. Option A is adults with speech impairments. That fits because the Leiter doesn't require speech, so it's suitable. Option B is children under two. I'm not sure, but maybe for very young kids, the Leiter could be used, but I think it's more for older children and adults with impairments.

Option C is adults who are mentally retarded. Well, mentally retarded individuals might have varying abilities, but traditional tests can sometimes still be used, though maybe the Leiter is an alternative. Option D is adults with physical disabilities. Physical disabilities might affect motor tasks, but the Leiter is more about cognitive abilities through performance, so maybe not the primary use.

Option E is children with hearing impairments. Since the Leiter is non-verbal, it's perfect for them because they can't hear the instructions, so performance-based tasks would work better. Option F is children with learning disabilities. Some learning disabilities might affect verbal skills, so the Leiter could be useful, but I'm not sure if that's the primary group it's designed for.

Option G is children with visual impairments. If they can't see, using visual tasks might not work, so maybe the Leiter isn't suitable here. Option H is elderly with memory loss. Maybe, but the Leiter is more for developmental issues rather than age-related cognitive decline. Option I is teenagers with emotional disorders. Emotional issues can affect testing, but the Leiter isn't specifically tailored for that unless they have other impairments.

Option J is adults with visual impairments. Similar to G, if they can't see, the visual tasks in Leiter might not be feasible. So, putting it all together, the Leiter is most useful for people who can't use verbal tests. That includes both speech and hearing impairments.

Wait, the question is asking for whom it's most useful. So between A, E, and maybe others. I think the Leiter was originally developed for individuals with intellectual disabilities who couldn't take verbal tests. But more specifically, it's used for those with speech impairments because it doesn't require verbal interaction. So the answer might be A.

But I'm a bit confused because I've also heard it's used for hearing impairments. Since both speech and hearing impairments would make traditional tests difficult, but the Leiter is non-verbal. So perhaps both A and E could be correct, but looking at the options, the answer is likely A: adults with speech impairments.

Wait, no, wait. The Leiter is also suitable for hearing impairments because it's non-verbal. So maybe the correct answer is E. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again.

The Leiter Scale uses tasks that don't require listening or talking, so both speech and hearing impaired individuals can take it. However, the original question is about the group it's most useful for. I think the primary group it's designed for is those with speech impairments because it was created as an alternative to verbal tests. So I'll go with A.

The Leiter International Performance Scale is designed for individuals who cannot take traditional verbal tests due to impairments. It uses non-verbal, performance-based tasks, making it suitable for those with speech or hearing impairments. While it can be used for both groups, it is most specifically tailored for adults with speech impairments, as it avoids the need for verbal communication.

Answer: A
