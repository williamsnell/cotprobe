Okay, so I need to figure out how many ribs are in the human body. Hmm, I remember learning about the skeleton in school, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Let me think. I know that the human skeleton has a lot of bones, but I'm specifically focusing on the ribs here.

Wait, I think the ribcage is made up of the ribs and the sternum. So each rib is attached to the spine and some to the sternum. But how many are there? I remember something about 12 pairs, but I'm not sure if that's correct. If there are 12 pairs, that would make 24 ribs in total. But wait, I also heard that some people have an extra rib, like a cervical rib, but I think that's not a standard part of the body. So maybe the standard number is 24.

Let me think of the structure. The ribcage has 12 vertebrae in the thoracic spine, right? Each vertebra has a pair of ribs. So 12 times 2 is 24. Yeah, that makes sense. So each side has 12 ribs, but since there are two sides, left and right, that's 24 in total.

Wait, but sometimes I get confused between the number of pairs and individual ribs. Oh, right, each pair consists of two ribs, one on each side. So 12 pairs equal 24 individual ribs. That must be the correct answer. So looking at the options, option B is 24. That should be the right choice.

The human body has 24 ribs, consisting of 12 pairs. Each pair is attached to the thoracic vertebrae and the sternum. Therefore, the correct answer is B: 24.
