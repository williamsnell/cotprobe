Okay, so I've got this ice hockey question here, and I need to figure out which of the options is not a penalty. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that in ice hockey, penalties are called when a player does something against the rules. There are various types of penalties, like minor, major, or misconduct. I need to go through each option and see if it's a recognized penalty or not.

Option A: Cross-passing. Wait, I think cross-passing is when a player passes the puck to a teammate who's in an offside position. I'm pretty sure that's a penalty because it's against the rules. So A is a penalty.

Option B: Charging. Charging is when a player checks another player with their body, and if it's not done correctly, like targeting the head or not using the stick properly, it's a penalty. So B is a penalty.

Option C: Carving. Hmm, carving isn't a term I'm too familiar with. Maybe it's similar to cross-checking? Cross-checking is when a player uses the stick to jab at an opponent, which is a penalty. So maybe C is a penalty, but I'm not 100% sure.

Option D: Butt-ending. That's when a player uses the end of their stick near the butt to hit another player. I remember that's definitely a penalty because it's dangerous.

Option E: Stick-checking. Stick-checking is a common defensive tactic where you try to knock the puck away from an opponent. I don't think that's a penalty unless it's done in a way that's excessive or dangerous, like hooking or slashing. So maybe E isn't a penalty, but I'm not certain yet.

Option F: Goal-tending. Goal-tending is just playing the goal, right? I don't think that's a penalty. Maybe F is not a penalty.

Option G: Sliding. Sliding is a technique players use to stay on their feet or move with the puck. I don't think that's a penalty. So G might be the answer.

Option H: Hooking. Hooking is when a player uses their stick to pull an opponent down. That's definitely a penalty.

Option I: Skating. Skating is just moving around the ice using skates. I don't think that's a penalty. So I might be the correct answer.

Option J: Puck-handling. Handling the puck is part of the game; players are supposed to handle it. So J isn't a penalty.

Wait, so the question is asking which is NOT a penalty. So I need to find the option that's not a penalty.

Looking back:

A: Penalty
B: Penalty
C: Possibly penalty
D: Penalty
E: Maybe not a penalty unless done improperly
F: Not a penalty
G: Not a penalty
H: Penalty
I: Not a penalty
J: Not a penalty.

Wait, I think I might be getting confused. Let me clarify each term.

Cross-passing (A) is a penalty because it causes an offside.
Charging (B) is a penalty.
Carving (C) I think refers to using the stick in a way that's not allowed, so it's a penalty.
Butt-ending (D) is a penalty.
Stick-checking (E) is allowed as long as it's done properly, so it's not a penalty.
Goal-tending (F) is part of the game, not a penalty.
Sliding (G) is a legal move.
Hooking (H) is a penalty.
Skating (I) is just movement, no penalty.
Puck-handling (J) is allowed.

So among the options, the ones that are not penalties are E, F, G, I, J. But the question asks which is NOT a penalty, so the correct answer is one of these. But the question is a single choice.

Wait, looking back at the options, the question is which is NOT a penalty. So the correct answer would be one of the non-penalties.

But the options are A to J, and the answer is one of them. Let me think again.

Wait, the options are:

A: cross-passing (penalty)
B: charging (penalty)
C: carving (penalty)
D: butt-ending (penalty)
E: stick-checking (not a penalty)
F: goal-tending (not a penalty)
G: sliding (not a penalty)
H: hooking (penalty)
I: skating (not a penalty)
J: puck-handling (not a penalty)

So the question is asking which is NOT a penalty. So the options that are not penalties are E, F, G, I, J. But the question expects one answer. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding some terms.

Wait, maybe I'm wrong about E: stick-checking. Because if you check someone with your stick in a legal way, it's not a penalty. But if you do it in a way that's too rough, like slashing, that's a penalty. So stick-checking itself is not a penalty, it's a legal play. So E is not a penalty.

Similarly, F: goal-tending is not a penalty because it's part of the game.

G: sliding is a technique, not a penalty.

I: skating is movement, not a penalty.

J: puck-handling is part of the game.

So the options that are not penalties are E, F, G, I, J. But the question is which one is NOT a penalty, so perhaps the answer is F, G, I, or J. But looking at the options, the question must have one correct answer.

Wait, perhaps the question is more about the specific terms. For example, 'cross-passing' is a specific term. Let me confirm each.

Cross-passing leads to an offside, so it's a penalty.

Charging is a penalty if it's done illegally.

Carving, I think, is another term for cross-checking, which is a penalty.

Butt-ending is a penalty.

Stick-checking is allowed, so E is not a penalty.

Goal-tending is allowed, so F is not a penalty.

Sliding is allowed, so G is not a penalty.

Hooking is a penalty.

Skating is allowed, so I is not a penalty.

Puck-handling is allowed, so J is not a penalty.

So the question is which is NOT a penalty, so the options are E, F, G, I, J.

But the question is in the options, so the answer must be one of these.

Looking at the options, the possible answers are E, F, G, I, J. But the question is to pick one.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is F: goal-tending. Because when a player is goal-tending, they're in the net, but maybe it's not considered a penalty. Or perhaps the term is different.

Alternatively, maybe 'sliding' is a technique, so it's not a penalty.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is I: skating, because it's a normal action, not a penalty.

Wait, but the question is which is NOT a penalty, so all except A, B, C, D, H are not penalties.

But the options are A to J, so the answer is one of E, F, G, I, J.

Wait, the original question lists the options, and the answer is one of them. So perhaps the correct answer is F: goal-tending, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, another approach: in hockey, penalties are called for actions like charging, cross-checking, hooking, butt-ending, etc. So the non-penalties would be things like stick-checking, goal-tending, sliding, skating, puck-handling.

So the question is which is NOT a penalty. So the answer is E, F, G, I, or J.

But the options are A to J, so the correct answer must be one of these.

Wait, the question is which is NOT a penalty. So the correct answer is E: stick-checking because it's a legal play, not a penalty.

But earlier I thought E is a penalty, but now I'm confused.

Wait, no, stick-checking is when you legally use your stick to knock the puck away. It's not a penalty unless it's done in a way that's dangerous, like slashing or hooking.

So E is not a penalty.

Similarly, F is not a penalty.

So the answer could be E, F, G, I, or J.

But the question expects one answer.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is F: goal-tending. Because in hockey, the goal-tender can't handle the puck in certain ways, but the term 'goal-tending' itself isn't a penalty.

Alternatively, the answer is E: stick-checking, because it's a legal action.

But the question is which is NOT a penalty. So the correct answer is one of E, F, G, I, J.

Wait, looking at the options again, perhaps the answer is F: goal-tending. Because when a player is goal-tending, they are in the net, and that's not a penalty.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is I: skating, because it's a normal action.

But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should look up each term.

Cross-passing: leads to offside, penalty.

Charging: penalty.

Carving: same as cross-checking, penalty.

Butt-ending: penalty.

Stick-checking: legal.

Goal-tending: legal.

Sliding: legal.

Hooking: penalty.

Skating: legal.

Puck-handling: legal.

So the options that are not penalties are E, F, G, I, J.

The question is to choose which one is NOT a penalty. So the correct answer is one of these. Since the options are A-J, and the question is a single choice, perhaps the intended answer is E: stick-checking.

But I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, the answer could be F: goal-tending.

Wait, perhaps the answer is F: goal-tending, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is I: skating, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the answer is E: stick-checking, because it's a legal play.

But I'm not confident. Let me think again.

In hockey, stick-checking is allowed. So E is not a penalty.

Similarly, F, G, I, J are not penalties.

So the question is which is NOT a penalty, so any of these could be the answer. But the options are A to J, and only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps the answer is F: goal-tending, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is I: skating, but that's a basic action.

Wait, maybe the intended answer is F: goal-tending, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is E: stick-checking.

Wait, I think the answer is E: stick-checking because it's a legal play, not a penalty.

But I'm not 100% sure. Maybe I should go with E.

In ice hockey, penalties are called for specific actions that break the rules. Let's analyze each option to determine which one is not a penalty:

- **A: Cross-passing** - This leads to an offside and is a penalty.
- **B: Charging** - Charging another player is a penalty.
- **C: Carving** - This refers to cross-checking, which is a penalty.
- **D: Butt-ending** - Using the end of the stick near the butt is a penalty.
- **E: Stick-checking** - Legally using the stick to knock the puck away is not a penalty.
- **F: Goal-tending** - This is part of the game and not a penalty.
- **G: Sliding** - A legal technique to stay on your feet, not a penalty.
- **H: Hooking** - Using the stick to pull an opponent down is a penalty.
- **I: Skating** - A normal action, not a penalty.
- **J: Puck-handling** - A legal part of the game, not a penalty.

The question asks which is **not** a penalty. While multiple options (E, F, G, I, J) are not penalties, the intended answer is likely **E: Stick-checking**, as it is a legal play.

Answer: E
