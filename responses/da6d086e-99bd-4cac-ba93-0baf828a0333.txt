Hmm, okay, so I've got this problem about calculating depreciation. Let me think through it step by step. So, the question is about an electric sign in Times Square. It costs $4,500, and it's expected to last 11,250 hours. After that, it scrap value is $450. And we need to find the depreciation charge for a month when it was used for 478 hours.

Wait, I remember that there are different methods of depreciation. The question doesn't specify the method, but since it's not given, I might need to consider the straight-line method. Or maybe the units-of-activity method. Oh right, the straight-line method is probably the most common unless stated otherwise.

Alright, straight-line depreciation. The formula for that is (Cost - Scrap Value) divided by the useful life in years, or wait, the useful life here is given in hours, so I need to adjust for that.

So, the formula is:

Depreciation per year = (Cost - Scrap Value) / Useful Life in years

Wait, but the useful life is 11,250 hours. So, I should calculate the depreciation per hour first.

Let me compute (4,500 - 450) = 4,050. Then divide by the number of hours: 11,250 hours.

So per hour depreciation is 4,050 / 11,250. Let me calculate that. Hmm.

4,050 divided by 11,250. Let's see, both divide by 25 first. 4050 ÷25=162, 11250 ÷25=450. So 162/450. Simplify that. Both divided by 6: 27/75. Wait, maybe I can do it another way.

Alternatively, 4,050 ÷11,250. Let me see, 11,250 divided by 4,050. Wait, no, I think it's easier to do 4,050 ÷11,250.

Let me compute 4,050 / 11,250.

Well, 4,050 ÷ 11,250 = (4,050 / 11,250) = 0.36 times something? Wait, no, wait: 4,050 ÷11,250.

Let me rephrase it as (4,050 ÷ 11,250) = (4,050 ÷11,250) = 0.36. Wait, no, wait, 4,050 ÷ 11,250. Let me calculate that properly.

Hmm, 11,250 / 4,050 = 2.777... So 4,050 is 1/2.777 of 11,250. So 4,050 /11,250 = 4,050 ÷ 11,250. Let me compute it as 4,050 ÷ 11,250. Let's write as 4050 ÷ 11250. Let me do this division.

We can simplify the numbers by dividing numerator and denominator by 50: 81 ÷ 225. Hmm, 81/225. Both can be divided by 9: 9/25. 9 ÷25 is 0.36. Oh, wait, 9/25 is 0.36. So 4,050 /11,250 = 0.36.

So the depreciation per hour is $0.36. But wait, let me double-check that. Because 0.36 per hour × 11,250 hours would be 4,050, which matches the cost minus salvage. So that's correct.

So, the depreciation per hour is $0.36. But wait, is this per hour or per year? Because the question is about one month's depreciation.

Wait, the question is about a month when it was used 478 hours. So, I think we need to calculate the depreciation for that month.

But wait, the straight-line depreciation is per year, so each hour is a fixed cost. So, if I take the per hour rate, multiply by the number of hours used.

So, per month, 478 hours × $0.36 per hour. Let me compute that.

478 × 0.36. Let's compute this.

478 × 0.36 = ?

Hmm, 400 × 0.36 = 144.

70 ×0.36 = 25.2.

8 ×0.36=2.88.

Adding them up: 144 +25.2 =169.2 +2.88=172.08.

Wait, so that would be $172.08 per month.

Looking at the options: option C is $172.08. So the answer should be C.

Alternatively, wait, is there another method? Oh, perhaps the units-of-activity method using the hours. Which is what I did.

Wait, but another thought: sometimes, the number of years is used instead. Let me double-check the depreciation per year.

The straight-line method calculates annual depreciation as (Cost - Scrap) / useful life in years. So, useful life is 11,250 hours. So, 11,250 / 12 = 937.5 years? Wait, that's a very long time. Wait, wait, no, wait. No, that's not correct. Because the depreciation is based on the total useful life in hours, not years. So 11,250 hours is the total life, so the depreciation per hour is calculated as (cost - scrap) divided by 11,250.

So, yes, the per hour rate is correct.

So, for 478 hours, the depreciation would be 478 × 0.36, which is $172.08.

Looking at the options, option C is $172.08. So the correct answer is C.

To calculate the depreciation charge for a month when the electric sign was used for 478 hours, we use the straight-line depreciation method. The formula is:

\[
\text{Depreciation per hour} = \frac{\text{Cost} - \text{Scrap Value}}{\text{Useful Life in hours}} = \frac{4,500 - 450}{11,250} = \frac{4,050}{11,250} = 0.36 \text{ dollars per hour}
\]

Next, we calculate the depreciation for 478 hours:

\[
\text{Depreciation for 478 hours} = 478 \times 0.36 = 172.08 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the depreciation charge for the month is $172.08.
