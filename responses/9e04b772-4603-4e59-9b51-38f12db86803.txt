Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here about externalities. Hmm, I remember from my economics class that externalities have something to do with costs or benefits that aren't borne by the parties involved in a transaction. Let me think through this step by step.

The question is asking what an externality does. The options are from A to J. Let me go through each one.

Option A says it results in a deficit of goods. Wait, a deficit is when there's not enough supply. But I think externalities can cause either overproduction or underproduction. For example, if a factory pollutes, the cost isn't borne by the factory, so they produce more than the socially optimal amount, leading to a surplus, not a deficit. So A might not be correct.

Option B says it results in a surplus. That could make sense if the externality is a positive one, but more often, externalities like pollution cause overproduction. Wait, no, wait. If there's a negative externality, like pollution, the market might produce more than what's socially optimal, leading to a surplus. So B could be a possibility, but I'm not sure yet.

Option C states that an externality exists when equilibrium equals market price. That doesn't sound right. Externalities are about situations where market outcomes don't maximize social welfare, but that's not directly about the price being equal. So I'll skip C.

Option D says it exists when markets can't reach equilibrium. No, markets can still reach an equilibrium, but that equilibrium might not be the socially optimal one. So D isn't correct.

Option E says it causes the equilibrium price to be artificially low. That sounds like a price floor or something, but externalities can affect prices through costs not accounted for. For example, if a good has a negative externality, the equilibrium price might be lower than the social cost, leading producers to overproduce. Wait, no, the equilibrium price in the market might not reflect the true cost. So maybe the price is lower than it should be because the externality isn't considered. So E could be correct, but I'm not certain.

Option F says it causes the equilibrium price to be artificially high. That would be the case if there's a tax or something, but externalities are usually about missing costs or benefits. So if there's a negative externality, the market price is too low because the cost isn't fully considered. So F might not be correct.

Option G says it results in an equilibrium that doesn't maximize total benefit. Yes, that's exactly what externalities do. Because externalities cause the market equilibrium to not align with the socially optimal point, the total benefit isn't maximized. So G seems correct.

Option H says it causes a left shift in the demand curve. That's when people want less at every price, but externalities don't directly cause that shift. They might affect supply or demand through other mechanisms, but H doesn't seem right.

Option I says the equilibrium quantity exceeds the market quantity. I'm not sure what this means. Equilibrium is where supply and demand meet, so if there's an externality, the equilibrium might not be efficient, but I don't think I is correct.

Option J says it causes a right shift in the supply curve. A right shift in supply is when more is supplied at every price, but externalities might cause firms to supply more because they don't bear the full cost. For example, with pollution, firms don't pay the full cost, so they produce more. So J could be correct, but I'm not sure if that's the best answer.

Wait, let's go back. The question is asking what an externality does. The main point is that an externality causes the market to reach an equilibrium that doesn't maximize social welfare. So option G directly addresses that. Other options might describe effects, but G is the most accurate definition of what an externality does.
</think>

An externality occurs when the actions of a firm or individual affect others without compensation. This disrupts the market equilibrium, leading to outcomes that do not maximize total societal benefit. 

**Analysis of Options:**
- **A & B:** Externalities can cause either a surplus or deficit, depending on the type, but these options are not the most accurate definitions.
- **C:** Equilibrium price matching market price is unrelated to externalities.
- **D:** Markets can still reach equilibrium, but it may not be socially optimal.
- **E & F:** These describe price distortions but are not the primary definition of externalities.
- **G:** Correctly identifies that externalities lead to an equilibrium that doesn't maximize total societal benefit.
- **H, I, J:** These describe specific shifts in curves or quantities but do not define externalities.

**Answer:** G
