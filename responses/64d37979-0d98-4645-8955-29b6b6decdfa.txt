Okay, so I have this question about why Australian and American megafauna were wiped out. I remember that megafauna refers to large animals, like big mammals, right? So the question is asking what probably caused their extinction.

The options are A to J. Let me think through each one. 

Option A is natural disasters like volcanic eruptions or earthquakes. I know that natural disasters can impact ecosystems, but I'm not sure if that's the main reason for the megafauna extinction. I think there's more evidence pointing towards human activity.

Option B is both humans and environmental changes. That sounds plausible because sometimes multiple factors contribute. But I'm not sure if it's the most agreed-upon answer.

Option C is invasive plant species altering habitats. I'm not too familiar with this, but I think some studies suggest that invasive species can change habitats, but was that a major factor for megafauna? Maybe not the primary cause.

Option D is sudden climate change due to global warming. Climate change does affect environments, but I'm not sure if it was a sudden event. I think the extinction events happened around the time humans arrived, so maybe humans played a bigger role.

Option E is humans carrying diseases over land bridges. I'm not sure about this. I know that when humans move, they can bring diseases, but I'm not sure if that's the main reason for megafauna extinction. It might have played a role, but I'm not certain.

Option F is humans. This seems like a strong possibility because when humans migrated to new continents, they often hunted large game. I remember reading that in Australia and the Americas, large animals like mammoths and kangaroos were hunted by humans, contributing to their extinction.

Option G is diseases from other animals. Maybe, but I think the primary cause was more direct, like hunting or habitat destruction by humans.

Option H is a comet or asteroid impact. I know that the extinction of the dinosaurs was due to an asteroid, but I don't think a comet impact is linked to the megafauna extinction events in Australia and America. That seems more like a past event.

Option I is environmental changes. This is similar to option D, but more general. While environmental changes can affect species, the timing with human arrival suggests human activity was more significant.

Option J is competition with other animals. I think competition might have happened, but again, the main factor is likely humans.

So, putting it together, the most probable answer is F, humans. They probably hunted the megafauna, and their arrival led to their decline. Also, environmental changes might have played a role, but the primary cause was human activity.

The extinction of Australian and American megafauna is widely attributed to human activity. When humans migrated to these continents, they likely hunted large animals like mammoths and kangaroos, leading to their decline. While environmental changes and other factors may have contributed, the primary cause is humans.

Answer: F
