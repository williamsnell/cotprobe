Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about what might happen to the housing construction industry if commercial banks are allowed to compete freely with mutual savings banks. The options are A through I, and I need to figure out which one is correct.

First, I should understand the roles of commercial banks and mutual savings banks. Commercial banks are for-profit institutions that offer a range of services, including loans, savings accounts, and investment services. They're known for their broad customer base and sometimes focus on larger transactions. Mutual savings banks, on the other hand, are typically not-for-profit and are owned by their members. They often provide services to their members at competitive rates, especially in savings and mortgages.

If commercial banks are allowed to compete more freely with mutual savings banks, what would that mean? Well, competition usually leads to more options for consumers. Commercial banks might start offering more mortgage products or better rates to attract customers. This could potentially increase the availability of loans for housing construction, which would mean more houses could be built or renovated.

Looking at the options:

A: Quality of housing construction would deteriorate. I don't see why competition would lead to lower quality. Banks are regulated, so they have to maintain certain standards. So maybe A is not correct.

B: More houses could be bought. If more loans are available because banks are competing, more people might get mortgages, leading to more house purchases. That seems plausible.

C: The housing industry would slump. If there's more competition, maybe prices could drop, but I'm not sure it would cause a slump. It might just adjust, but not necessarily a slump.

D: Mutual savings banks would become obsolete. That's possible if commercial banks can offer better terms, but mutual banks have their own advantages, like community focus. So maybe not obsolete, but perhaps they'd have to adapt.

E: Deposits in mutual savings banks would increase. If commercial banks are competing, maybe mutuals would have to offer better rates, which could attract more deposits. But I'm not sure if that's a direct outcome.

F: Housing prices would become more volatile. More competition could change the market dynamics, but I'm not certain it would cause volatility. Maybe not the main effect.

G: The housing industry would boom. If more loans are available, more construction might happen, leading to a boom. That sounds possible.

H: Commercial banks would focus solely on large developments. They might, but I think they'd also target individual home buyers to compete.

I: No noticeable change. If competition increases, there should be some change, so I think this is unlikely.

Between B, G, and maybe E. Let me think again. If commercial banks compete, they might lower interest rates or offer more flexible terms, making it easier for people to buy homes. This increased demand could lead to more construction, which would mean more houses are built (option B) or a boom in the industry (option G). 

I think the main effect would be more houses being built because of increased lending. So option B might be the answer. Alternatively, if the industry booms, that would also mean more houses. Hmm, maybe G is more accurate because a boom implies a significant increase, whereas B is just more houses bought, which could happen but might not be the primary effect.

Wait, but the question is about the housing construction industry. If more loans are available, construction companies can build more, so the industry would boom. So G seems more likely. But I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, more competition could lead to lower prices, making more houses affordable, which would mean more people buy them, so B.

I think the key is that increased competition from commercial banks would likely lead to more lending, which supports more construction. So the industry would boom. So the answer might be G.

The housing construction industry could experience a boom as commercial banks compete with mutual savings banks, increasing lending and supporting more construction. 

Answer: G
