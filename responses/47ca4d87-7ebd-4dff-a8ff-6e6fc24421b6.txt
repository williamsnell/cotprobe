Question:

Unlike large populations, small populations are vulnerable to various processes that draw populations down an extinction vortex toward smaller and smaller populations until no individuals survive. Which of the following statements correctly identifies the factors that endanger a population?

Options:

A: Inbreeding and loss of genetic variation threaten a population.
B: Increased competition for resources within the population threatens a population.
C: Overpopulation is a direct threat to the survival of a population.
D: Weather and climate changes have no impact on small populations.
E: Mutation reduces the health of a population.
F: Small populations are not affected by diseases.
G: The growth of human settlements and industries does not impact small populations.
H: Migration of new individuals into the population threatens a population.
I: Breeding with individuals from a different population may cause the extinction of the first population due to a decrease in diversity.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here about why small populations are more vulnerable to extinction. I'm a bit rusty on my ecology, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking which factors endanger a small population, leading it down an extinction vortex. The options are A through I. Let me go through each one.

First, the main point is that small populations face certain threats that larger ones don't as much. I remember that genetic issues like inbreeding can be a problem when populations are small. Inbreeding leads to a loss of genetic diversity, which makes the population less adaptable and more susceptible to diseases or other threats. So option A says inbreeding and loss of genetic variation threaten a population. That sounds correct.

Option B talks about increased competition for resources. Well, competition is a natural thing, but I'm not sure if it's more of a threat specifically to small populations. Maybe if the population is small, each individual has to compete more, but I'm not certain. I'll keep this in mind but not jump to conclusions yet.

Option C says overpopulation is a direct threat. Wait, overpopulation usually refers to when a population grows beyond what the environment can support. But if the population is small and maybe isolated, overpopulation doesn't make much sense. Plus, the question is about small populations being vulnerable, so overpopulation seems like the opposite issue. I don't think C is right.

Option D claims that weather and climate changes have no impact. That doesn't seem right. Climate changes can affect any population, regardless of size. Small populations might be more vulnerable because they have less resilience, but D says it has no impact, which is incorrect. So D is wrong.

Option E says mutation reduces health. While mutations can be harmful, they can also be neutral or beneficial. In small populations, harmful mutations might accumulate because there's less genetic diversity to mask them, but I'm not sure if mutation itself is the main threat here. It might be a factor, but I think inbreeding is more directly linked to extinction vortices.

Option F claims small populations aren't affected by diseases. That doesn't make sense. In fact, diseases can spread more easily in small, dense populations because there's less dispersion. So F is definitely incorrect.

Option G says human growth doesn't impact small populations. That's not true. Human settlements and industries often encroach on natural habitats, affecting all populations, including small ones. So G is wrong.

Option H suggests that migration of new individuals threatens the population. Wait, migration usually brings in new genes, which can be beneficial for small populations by increasing genetic diversity. So migration shouldn't be a threat; it should help. Therefore, H is incorrect.

Option I says breeding with another population causes extinction due to decreased diversity. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. If a population breeds with another, it might introduce new genes, which could actually help prevent extinction by increasing diversity. Unless the other population has harmful genes, but generally, gene flow is beneficial. So I think I is incorrect because it's the opposite of what should happen.

So, going back, the main factors for small populations are inbreeding and loss of genetic diversity. That matches option A. Other options either don't make sense or are incorrect in their reasoning.

A: Inbreeding and loss of genetic variation threaten a population.

The correct answer is A. Small populations are indeed more vulnerable to inbreeding and loss of genetic variation, which can lead to reduced adaptability and increased extinction risk.

Answer: A
