Okay, so I've got this question about the reserve requirement and how the Fed's action affects the money supply. Hmm, let's think this through. I remember that the reserve requirement is the amount of money that banks must keep on hand, not lent out. In this case, it's 10%, so that means for every dollar a bank has, they have to keep 10 cents as reserves.

The question says the Fed sells $29 million worth of government securities. Wait, when the Fed sells securities, that's an open market operation. Selling securities means they're taking money out of the economy, right? Because they're selling them to banks or other financial institutions, which pay them with money. So that reduces the amount of money in circulation.

Now, how does this affect the money supply? Well, when the Fed sells securities, it's decreasing the money supply. But the exact amount depends on the reserve requirement. Because when the Fed sells, it's taking money out, which means banks have less money to lend. The money multiplier effect comes into play here. The formula I think is (1 / reserve requirement). So with a 10% reserve, the multiplier is 10 times.

Wait, but when the Fed sells securities, it's actually reducing the excess reserves in the banking system. Because banks use their reserves to buy these securities. So the initial change is that the Fed gets $29 million from selling the securities. This $29 million is subtracted from the banks' reserves.

So the money supply effect is that the money multiplier will cause a larger change. The change in money supply is (change in reserves) multiplied by the money multiplier. But wait, in this case, the Fed is selling, so it's a decrease. So the change in reserves is -$29 million. The money multiplier is 1 / 0.10 = 10. So the change in money supply would be -29 * 10 = -290 million. So the money supply decreases by $290 million.

Looking at the options, option J is decrease by $290 million. That seems right. Let me double-check. If the Fed sells $29 million, that's a reduction in their assets, so they remove $29 million from the banks' reserves. The banks can't lend out that $29 million anymore, but since they have a reserve requirement, the actual impact is 10 times that because each dollar not lent out reduces the money supply by 10 times.

Wait, no, actually, the money multiplier is used when the Fed adds reserves. When they sell securities, they take away reserves. So the money supply decreases by the amount equal to the reserves removed multiplied by the money multiplier. So 29 million * 10 = 290 million decrease. Yep, that's option J.

The Fed sells $29 million in securities, reducing banks' reserves. With a 10% reserve requirement, the money multiplier is 10. Thus, the money supply decreases by $29 million Ã— 10 = $290 million.

Answer: J
