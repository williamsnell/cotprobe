Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which statement about human amino acid requirements is correct. Let me go through each option one by one and think through what I remember about amino acids and nutrition.

First, I know that amino acids are essential for building proteins, and different age groups have different requirements because their bodies are at various stages of growth, maintenance, or possibly even breakdown.

Option A: The amino acid requirements determined for adults is assumed to be the requirement pattern for all ages. Hmm, that doesn't sound right. Adults are in a maintenance phase, but infants and children are growing, so their needs must be higher. So A is probably incorrect.

Option B: The amino acid pattern of breast milk is assumed to be the requirement pattern for all children. I remember that breast milk is considered optimal for infants, but does it apply to all children? I think breast milk is more relevant for infants, not necessarily older children. So B might not be correct.

Option C: The amino acid requirements determined for infants is assumed to be the requirements for maintenance for all ages. No, infants have high requirements because they're growing rapidly. Maintenance would be lower, so C is wrong.

Option D: The amino acid pattern of animal protein is assumed to be the requirement patterns for adults. I know that animal proteins are often considered complete, but the requirement patterns are based on human needs, not the protein source. So D might not be correct.

Option E: The amino acid pattern of human tissue protein is assumed to be the requirement patterns for all ages. Human tissues have a certain amino acid composition, but I'm not sure if it's used for all ages. It might be a basis, but probably not for all. Wait, I think the amino acid requirements are based on the body's needs, which do vary with age. So E might not be correct.

Option F: The amino acid requirements determined for adults is assumed to be the requirements for maintenance for all ages. Maintenance implies adults are in a steady state, but other ages have different needs. So F is probably incorrect.

Option G: The amino acid pattern of human tissue protein is assumed to be the requirement patterns for infants and young children. Wait, human tissue protein is what our body uses, so maybe infants require a pattern closer to human milk, not tissue. I'm not sure about this one. Maybe G is incorrect.

Option H: The amino acid pattern of breast milk is assumed to be the requirement pattern for all adults. No, adults are in maintenance, not growth, so H is wrong.

Option I: The amino acid requirements determined for the elderly is assumed to be the requirements for maintenance for all ages. The elderly have different needs, possibly lower protein, so I is incorrect.

Option J: The amino acid requirements determined for children is assumed to be the requirement pattern for all ages. No, children's needs are higher than adults, so this can't be right.

Wait, I might have missed something. Let me think again. The correct approach is that the amino acid requirements are determined based on the nitrogen balance and the body's needs. For infants, breast milk is the model, and for adults, it's based on maintaining nitrogen balance.

Looking back, the correct statement should be that the amino acid pattern of human tissue protein is the requirement for all ages. Because the body's proteins are made of a certain amino acid composition, and that's what we need to maintain. So E says that human tissue protein's pattern is assumed for all ages. That sounds correct because the body's own proteins dictate the required amino acid composition for maintenance.

Wait, but in reality, infants require a different pattern because they're growing. So maybe E is not correct. Alternatively, the amino acid requirements for adults are for maintenance, and for infants, they're higher. So perhaps the correct answer is E because it states that human tissue protein's amino acid pattern is assumed for all ages, which might be the basis for determining requirements.

Alternatively, I might be mixing up concepts. Let me think again. The amino acid requirements are based on the body's needs. For adults, it's about maintaining nitrogen balance, so the pattern is similar to human tissues. For infants, it's more like breast milk. So the correct statement is E: the amino acid pattern of human tissue protein is assumed to be the requirement patterns for all ages.

Wait, but that doesn't sound right because infants have higher needs. So maybe E is incorrect. Another approach: the correct answer is E because it's the only option that correctly states that human tissue amino acids are the basis for all ages, even though infants have different patterns.

Alternatively, I'm getting confused. Let me recall that the FAO/WHO/UNU set the amino acid requirements based on the body's protein turnover. Adults require amino acids to maintain their protein, so their pattern is based on human tissue. Infants, needing growth, have higher requirements, but their pattern is based on breast milk, which is different.

So looking at the options, E says human tissue is the pattern for all ages. That would be incorrect because infants have a different pattern (breast milk). But the question is about which statement is correct. So the correct answer is E if the statement is accurate, or perhaps another option.

Wait, looking at option E again: "The amino acid pattern of human tissue protein is assumed to be the requirement patterns for all ages." No, that's not correct because infants have different requirements based on growth, not maintenance. So E is incorrect.

Then, perhaps F is correct. F says the amino acid requirements for adults are assumed to be the requirements for maintenance for all ages. But no, because maintenance is specific to adults, not all ages. So F is incorrect.

Wait, maybe the correct answer is E because it's the only one that mentions human tissue, which is the basis for determining requirements for all ages. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is E because it's the closest to the correct principle.

Wait, another angle: the amino acid requirements are based on the body's composition, which for adults is about maintenance, but for infants, it's about growth. So the correct pattern for all ages isn't the same. Therefore, E is incorrect. Then, perhaps none of the options are correct, but that can't be the case.

Wait, let me think about each option again. Option E says the amino acid pattern of human tissue protein is the requirement for all ages. That's not accurate because infants require a different pattern, closer to breast milk. So E is incorrect.

Then, looking back, perhaps the correct answer is E is incorrect, and the correct statement is that the amino acid pattern of human tissue is used as the requirement for adults, but not all ages. So looking at the options, none seem correct except perhaps E.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is E. I'm getting a bit stuck, but I'll go with E as the correct answer because it's the only one that aligns with the idea that human tissue composition dictates amino acid needs, even though I'm a bit uncertain.

The correct answer is **E**: The amino acid pattern of human tissue protein is assumed to be the requirement patterns for all ages.
