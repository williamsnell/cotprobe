Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question with two statements, and I need to figure out if each is true or not. The options are A through J, each giving different combinations. Let me break it down.

First, Statement 1: "R is a splitting field of some polynomial over Q." Hmm, R usually stands for the field of real numbers, and Q is the rationals. A splitting field is a field extension where a given polynomial can be factored into linear terms. Now, the real numbers are a field where every polynomial splits into linear factors only if it's of degree 1 (like linear polynomials) or if it's a quadratic with real roots. But wait, not all polynomials split in R. For example, xÂ² + 1 doesn't split in R because its roots are imaginary. So R can't be a splitting field for all polynomials over Q. But the statement says "some" polynomial, not all. So yes, R is a splitting field for polynomials that have all real roots. For example, x - 1 splits in R. So Statement 1 is True.

Now, Statement 2: "There is a field with 60 elements." I remember that finite fields, also called Galois fields, have order p^n where p is a prime and n is a positive integer. So 60 factors into 2^2 * 3 * 5. Wait, but 60 isn't a prime power. It's 2^2 * 3 *5, which is 4*3*5=60. Since 60 isn't a prime power, there can't be a field with 60 elements. So Statement 2 is False.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check. The number of elements in a finite field must be a prime power. So 60 is not a prime power. So yes, Statement 2 is False.

So looking at the options, I need to find which option says Statement 1 is True and Statement 2 is False. Looking at the options:

Option C: True, False. That's it. So the answer should be C.

The first statement is true because the real numbers (R) can be a splitting field for some polynomials over Q, such as linear polynomials. The second statement is false because a field with 60 elements cannot exist since 60 is not a prime power. 

Answer: C
