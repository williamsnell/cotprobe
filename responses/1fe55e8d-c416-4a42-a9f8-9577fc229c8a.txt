Question:

A man decided to stop at a drive-through hamburger stand for a late snack. As he drove up to the drive- through line, the manager of the hamburger stand informed him through the intercom system that the restaurant was closing and no further orders would be accepted. She told the man that the last car to be served was the one directly in front of him. The man became angry and yelled into the intercom machine, "Listen, babe, I am hungry. I want two cheeseburgers, a large order of fries, and a Coke. " The manager retorted, "I'm terribly sorry, but we cannot accept your order. "Shortly thereafter, the manager handed the food order to the passengers in the car immediately in front of the man's. When the man saw the manager serving that car, he became very angry, drove his automobile up to the service window and shouted at the manager, "You can't do this to me. " When the manager laughed, the man suddenly reached into the car's glove compartment and pulled out a gun. He aimed at the manager and fired the weapon, intending to hit her. The bullet missed the manager but hit a customer, wounding him in the head. In an action by the customer against the man for battery, the customer will be

Options:

A: successful, because the man caused harm with his actions, regardless of his intent.
B: unsuccessful, because the man was not aiming at the customer.
C: unsuccessful, because the manager could have prevented the situation by accepting the man's order.
D: successful, because the man was acting recklessly and created a dangerous situation.
E: unsuccessful, because the man could not foresee that the bullet would hit anyone other than the manager.
F: unsuccessful, because the man was provoked by the manager's refusal to serve him.
G: unsuccessful, because the man did not intend to shoot the customer.
H: successful, because there was a "substantial certainty" that the customer would be hit by the bullet.
I: successful, because the man intended to shoot the manager.
J: successful, because the bullet from the man's gun directly caused the customer's injury.

Okay, so I need to figure out the correct answer to this torts question. Let me read through the scenario carefully.

So, the man is at a drive-through, and the manager tells him the restaurant is closing and they won't take any more orders. The last car in front of him will be served. He gets angry and orders food through the intercom, but she refuses. Then, she gives the last order to the car in front, which makes him even angrier. He drives up, yells at her, and when she laughs, he pulls out a gun, aims at her, and shoots. The bullet misses her but hits a customer, causing a head injury.

The question is about whether the customer can successfully sue the man for battery. The options are A through J.

I remember that battery is an intentional tort. It requires intentional contact with another person, causing harmful or offensive contact. But wait, sometimes it's about the intent behind the action. If someone intends to hit one person but ends up hitting another, does that count as battery?

In this case, the man aimed at the manager. He intended to shoot her. But the bullet missed and hit the customer instead. So, did he have the intent to cause contact with the customer? I think intent can be transferred. Like, if you throw a rock at person A and hit person B, you intended to hit A, but you're still liable for battery against B because your intention to hit A included the knowledge that it might hit someone in that vicinity. Or maybe it's about whether you acted with the intent to cause harmful contact, regardless of who it was.

Option A says the man caused harm regardless of intent. But battery is intentional, so A might not be right because it's more about intent. Option D says he acted recklessly and created a dangerous situation. That sounds more like negligence, but the man was intentional in pulling the gun and shooting. Option J says the bullet directly caused the injury, which is true, but does that alone make it battery? Or does it require intent towards the specific person?

Option I says he intended to shoot the manager, which would make it battery against her. But the customer was hit instead. So does the intent transfer? I think so. Because when you intentionally commit an act that causes contact with another person, even if you aimed elsewhere, you can still be liable. Like, if you swing at A and hit B, you intended to hit A but it's still battery against B.

Looking at the options, J says the bullet directly caused the injury, which is a fact, but that alone doesn't capture the intent. Option D is about recklessness, which might not fit because he was acting intentionally. Option I is about intent to shoot the manager, but the battery is against the customer. So, the correct reasoning is that the man's intentional act caused the contact with the customer, making it battery.

Wait, but I should check the specific tort rules. Battery requires an intentional act that results in harmful or offensive contact. The intent can be transferred if the act was intended to cause contact with someone else. So even if he aimed at the manager, his intent to shoot in that direction was enough to make the contact with the customer intentional.

So looking at the options, J says the bullet caused the injury. But the reasoning is more about intent. Wait, option I says he intended to shoot the manager, but the customer was hit. So the intent was to shoot the manager, but the act resulted in shooting the customer. Does that make it battery against the customer?

I think the key is that the man's act was intentional, and the result was contact with the customer. So the battery is against the customer because the contact was a result of the intentional act, even if not the intended target.

So the correct answer is J: successful because the bullet directly caused the injury. Or is it I? Hmm. I think J is more about causation, but the main issue is intent. Wait, no, battery requires intent to cause contact, which can be transferred. So the man intended to shoot the manager, but the act resulted in shooting the customer, so he's liable for battery against the customer. Therefore, the correct answer is I: successful because he intended to shoot the manager, but that's not exactly correct because the customer is the one who was injured. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the options.

Wait, option I says "successful, because the man intended to shoot the manager." But the customer is the one suing. So the intent was to shoot the manager, but the bullet hit the customer. Does that mean the intent was to shoot the manager, but the act resulted in shooting the customer, making the man liable for battery towards the customer?

I think the correct answer is J, because the bullet directly caused the injury, and the man's act was intentional. But I'm a bit confused between I and J. I think J is better because it focuses on the direct cause, but the intent is also a factor. Alternatively, since the man intended to shoot someone (the manager), and the bullet hit the customer, the intent to cause contact was present, so it's battery. Therefore, either I or J could be correct, but I think J is more about causation, while I is about intent towards the manager, not the customer. So maybe the correct answer is J because the act caused the injury, regardless of intent towards the customer.

Wait, no, battery requires intent to cause contact with the specific person. But in this case, the man didn't intend to hit the customer, but he intended to hit the manager. However, in tort law, if the defendant intended to cause harmful contact to one person, and the contact occurs with another, the intent transfers. So, the intent to cause contact is sufficient, regardless of who it was. Therefore, the man's intent was to cause contact (shooting), so even though he aimed at the manager, the contact with the customer is enough for battery.

So the correct answer is I: successful because the man intended to shoot the manager. But wait, the customer is suing, so the intent to shoot the manager is not directly relevant. Or is it? Because the intent to shoot in that area is enough. Alternatively, the correct reasoning is that the man acted intentionally, causing contact, so it's battery regardless of intent towards the specific person.

I think the correct answer is J: successful, because the bullet directly caused the injury. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, D says he acted recklessly, but he was acting intentionally, so D is not correct. Option I might be about intent towards the manager, but the battery is against the customer. I think the key is that the man's intention to shoot was intentional, and the bullet hitting the customer was a result of that act, making it battery. So the answer is I or J. I'm a bit confused.

Wait, looking at the options again. Option I says he intended to shoot the manager, which is true, but the customer is suing. So the battery against the customer is because the bullet hit him. So the man's intent was to shoot the manager, but the act resulted in shooting the customer. So the intent to cause contact was present, transferred to the customer. Therefore, the correct answer is I: successful because the man intended to shoot the manager, which caused the customer's injury.

Alternatively, J says the bullet directly caused the injury, which is a fact, but the intent is the key. So I think the correct answer is I.

The scenario describes a situation where the man intentionally aimed and fired a gun at the manager, resulting in a bullet that missed the manager and struck the customer, causing injury. Battery requires an intentional act that results in harmful or offensive contact. The man's intent to shoot the manager satisfies the intent requirement, and the act of firing the gun, which caused contact with the customer, fulfills the requirement of causing harm. The intent to shoot the manager is sufficient because the act of shooting in that direction demonstrates the intention to cause contact, even if the specific target was not the customer. Therefore, the customer's injury is a foreseeable result of the man's intentional act, making the battery claim successful.

Answer: I
