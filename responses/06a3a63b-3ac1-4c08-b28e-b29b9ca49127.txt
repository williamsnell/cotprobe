Okay, so I have this physics problem here about calculating how much heat an electric iron produces in 5 minutes. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my physics, but let me see if I can work this out step by step.

Alright, the question says the iron draws 5 amperes from a 120-volt line. Oh right, I remember that electric power can be calculated using the formula P = V * I, where P is power, V is voltage, and I is current. So, first I need to find the power the iron is using.

So plugging in the numbers: V is 120 volts, I is 5 amps. So P = 120 * 5. Let me do that multiplication. 120 times 5 is 600. So the power is 600 watts. Wait, that seems high. Oh, but electric irons do use a lot of power, I guess. Yeah, that makes sense.

Now, the next part is figuring out how much heat is produced. Heat in this context is the energy used, right? So I need to calculate the energy, which is power multiplied by time. The formula for energy is E = P * t. But wait, the units here are important. The power is in watts, which is joules per second, and the time is given in minutes. So I need to convert the time from minutes to seconds to make the units match.

So 5 minutes is 5 multiplied by 60 seconds. Let me calculate that. 5 times 60 is 300 seconds. Okay, so t is 300 seconds.

Now, plug those into the energy formula. E = 600 W * 300 s. Hmm, 600 times 300. Let me break that down. 6 times 3 is 18, and then there are two zeros from each, so that's 180,000. So E is 180,000 joules. Right, because watts are joules per second, so multiplying by seconds gives joules.

But wait, the answer options are in calories, not joules. I remember that there's a conversion factor between joules and calories. One calorie is approximately 4.184 joules. So to convert joules to calories, I need to divide by 4.184.

So E in calories is 180,000 J divided by 4.184 J/cal. Let me do that division. Let me approximate 4.184 as roughly 4.2 for easier calculation. So 180,000 divided by 4.2.

Hmm, 180,000 divided by 4.2. Let me see: 4.2 times 42,857 is about 180,000 because 4.2 times 40,000 is 168,000, and 4.2 times 2,857 is roughly 12,000. So adding those together, 168k +12k=180k. So 42,857 calories approximately.

Wait, but looking at the options, the closest one would be... Let me check the options again. The options are A:72,000, B:80,000, C:36,000, D:65,000, E:48,000, F:43,000, G:60,000, H:50,000, I:54,000, J:30,000.

Wait, none of these are close to 42,857. Did I make a mistake somewhere? Let me double-check my calculations.

Oh wait, maybe I messed up the time conversion. Wait, the time is 5 minutes, which is 300 seconds. That part was correct. Power was 600 W, so that's right. So 600 * 300 is 180,000 J. Then converting to calories: 180,000 / 4.184 ≈ ?

Wait, perhaps I should calculate it more accurately. Let me do that division precisely.

So 180,000 divided by 4.184. Let me set it up.

4.184 × 42,857 ≈ 180,000 as before. But perhaps I should use a calculator approach.

Alternatively, maybe I should use the fact that 1 calorie = 4.184 J, so 1 J = 1/4.184 calories ≈ 0.2388 calories.

So 180,000 J * 0.2388 cal/J ≈ ?

Let me compute 180,000 * 0.2388.

First, 180,000 * 0.2 = 36,000.

Then 180,000 * 0.0388 = ?

0.0388 is approximately 0.04 minus 0.0012.

So 180,000 * 0.04 = 7,200.

Minus 180,000 * 0.0012 = 216.

So 7,200 - 216 = 6,984.

Now add that to the 36,000: 36,000 + 6,984 = 42,984 calories.

So approximately 42,984 calories, which rounds to about 43,000. Looking back at the options, option F is 43,000 calories. But wait, the options don't have F as 43,000. Let me check again.

Wait, option F is 43,000, yes. So that's the answer.

Wait, but wait another thing. Did I make a mistake in the power calculation? Because 120 volts times 5 amps is 600 watts, that's correct. Time is 5 minutes, which is 300 seconds.

But another way to calculate energy is using watt-hours. Wait, because sometimes people use that method. Let me think.

Wait, power in watts, time in hours. So 5 minutes is 5/60 hours, which is 1/12 hours. So power is 600 W, so energy in watt-hours would be 600 * (5/60) = 600 * (1/12) = 50 watt-hours.

But to convert watt-hours to joules, since 1 watt-hour is 3.6 million joules (because 1 W = 1 J/s, so 1 W * 3600 s = 3600 J). So 50 watt-hours is 50 * 3,600,000 J? Wait, no. Wait, 1 watt-hour is 3,600 J. So 50 watt-hours is 50 * 3,600 = 180,000 J. Which matches what I had before. So that's correct.

So back to calories: 180,000 J is about 42,984 calories, which rounds to 43,000. So option F is 43,000 calories.

Wait, but looking back at the options, I see that option E is 48,000, F is 43,000, and others are lower or higher. So perhaps I did everything correctly, and the answer is F. But let me double-check all steps once more to be sure.

Wait, another thought: sometimes, electric appliances have a power factor, but the problem doesn't mention it, so I assume it's a resistive load, so power is purely P = V * I. So that step is correct.

Alternatively, maybe the question expects using calories as in food calories, which are actually kilocalories. Wait, no, in physics, a calorie is 4.184 joules, and a food Calorie is 1000 calories. But the options are in calories, so I think it's correct as is.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the division. Let me compute 180,000 / 4.184 more accurately.

Let me try long division. 4.184 goes into 180,000 how many times?

Well, 4.184 * 42,857 ≈ 180,000, as before. But perhaps I should compute it more precisely.

Alternatively, using a calculator approach: 4.184 * 42,857 = ?

Well, 42,857 * 4 = 171,428.

42,857 * 0.184 = ?

42,857 * 0.1 = 4,285.7.

42,857 * 0.08 = 3,428.56.

42,857 * 0.004 = 171.428.

Adding those together: 4,285.7 + 3,428.56 = 7,714.26; plus 171.428 gives 7,885.688.

So 42,857 * 4.184 ≈ 171,428 + 7,885.688 ≈ 179,313.688, which is slightly less than 180,000. So to reach 180,000, we need a bit more.

The difference is 180,000 - 179,313.688 = 686.312.

So 686.312 / 4.184 ≈ approximately 164 more. So total would be 42,857 + 164 ≈ 43,021.

So about 43,021 calories, which rounds to 43,000. So the correct option is F:43,000 calories.

The heat produced by the electric iron is calculated using the formula \( E = P \times t \), where \( P = V \times I \). With \( V = 120 \, \text{V} \) and \( I = 5 \, \text{A} \), the power \( P = 600 \, \text{W} \). The time \( t = 5 \, \text{minutes} = 300 \, \text{seconds} \). Thus, \( E = 600 \times 300 = 180,000 \, \text{J} \). Converting joules to calories using \( 1 \, \text{cal} = 4.184 \, \text{J} \), we find \( E \approx 43,000 \, \text{calories} \).
