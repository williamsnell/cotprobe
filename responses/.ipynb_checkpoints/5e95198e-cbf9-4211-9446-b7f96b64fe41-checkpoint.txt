Alright, let's tackle this multiple-choice question. So, the question is about identifying what kind of firm a marketing research company is, based on the services they provide. The firm in question contracts with clients to conduct a complete marketing research project, including data collection, analysis, and reporting. I need to choose the correct option from A to J.

First, I'll break down the key components of the question. The firm does three main things: data collection, analysis, and reporting. So they're handling the entire process from start to finish. That suggests they're a comprehensive or full-service provider rather than specializing in just one part of the process.

Looking at the options:

A: Data collection firm. Well, that's just one part of what they do, so probably not the best fit.

B: Freelance agency. Freelance implies individual contractors rather than a full agency, so maybe not.

C: Data analysis firm. Again, only part of the services they offer, so not the full picture.

D: Survey firm. Surveys are a method of data collection, but the firm does more than that.

E: Full-service agency. This sounds promising because it implies they handle all aspects of the project.

F: Tabulation agency. That's about processing data, another subset, not the whole package.

G: Marketing agency. Marketing agencies can vary, but they might not specifically handle the research part comprehensively.

H: Research firm. This is a possibility, but it's a bit vague. It could mean they do research but not necessarily the full service.

I: Consultant. Consultants provide expert advice but might not handle the entire project execution.

J: Field agency. This relates to the fieldwork part, like collecting data on-site, which is just one part.

So, putting it together, the firm is doing everything from data collection to analysis and reporting, which means they're a full-service agency. That aligns with option E.
