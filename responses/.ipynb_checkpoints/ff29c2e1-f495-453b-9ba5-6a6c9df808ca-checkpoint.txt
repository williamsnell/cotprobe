Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best answer to this public relations question. Let me break it down step by step. 

The scenario is that I'm the VP of PR for a company that makes a well-known food product. In Albany, NY, one of our products has been found contaminated, causing a lot of people to have severe stomach issues. It's not fatal, but still serious. The contamination is traced back to our product, which is sold nationwide. The CEO wants my advice to prevent a PR disaster.

The options are A through J. I need to pick the best one.

First, what's the situation? There's a product recall issue. The product is causing illnesses, so it's a serious matter. The company needs to handle this carefully to maintain public trust.

Looking at the options:

A: Conduct an internal investigation but don't acknowledge publicly. Hmm, that might not be good because if the issue is already known, hiding it could make things worse. People might find out later and lose trust.

B: Issue a press release to Albany explaining how to treat symptoms. That seems helpful but maybe too limited. The problem is in Albany, but the product is sold nationwide. So, maybe they should address it more broadly.

C: Stop all sales and issue a recall nationwide. This seems proactive. If the product is contaminated and causing harm, pulling it off the shelves and recalling it could prevent more people from getting sick. It shows responsibility.

D: Quickly investigate to confirm it's definitely the cause. While important, this might delay the response. People might get sicker while waiting for confirmation, and the delay could hurt the company's image.

E: Recall only where complaints were received. That might not be enough because the contamination could be widespread, not just where complaints were made. Also, it might seem like the company is only addressing known problems, not taking full responsibility.

F: Continue sales with warning labels. This could be risky. If the product is unsafe, continuing sales even with warnings might not be the best approach. It could be seen as putting profits over safety.

G: Offer vouchers as compensation. While this helps affected customers, it doesn't address the root cause. People might feel the company is just trying to fix the PR issue without fixing the product.

H: Deny responsibility until more info is available. Denying responsibility is usually bad for PR. It can lead to distrust and legal issues. Better to acknowledge the problem and take action.

I: Stop sales and recall only in Albany. Since the product is sold nationwide, and the contamination could be widespread, this might not be sufficient. Only addressing Albany might leave other areas at risk.

J: Downplay the severity. This is bad because underplaying the issue can lead to more serious consequences later. People might get more sick, and the company's credibility would take a hit.

So, considering all options, the best approach seems to be C: Stop all sales and issue a recall nationwide. This shows immediate action and responsibility, which is crucial in a PR crisis. It prevents more people from being affected and demonstrates that the company prioritizes customer health over sales.

The best approach is to act swiftly and responsibly. By stopping all sales and issuing a nationwide recall, the company shows immediate concern for customer health, which is essential for maintaining public trust and avoiding a PR disaster.

Answer: C
