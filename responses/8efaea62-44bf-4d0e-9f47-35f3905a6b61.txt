Question:

A woman needed to have her microwave repaired. She contacted the local handyman, who said he could repair the microwave for $100. The woman readily agreed and delivered the microwave to the handyman, who promised to have it ready in two weeks. One week later, the handyman realized that he had so much work to do that he would not be able to repair the microwave on time. He then took the microwave to a repair store. The repair store agreed to repair the microwave for $80 within one week. The owner of the repair store that contracted with the handyman was unaware that the woman actually owned the microwave. If the repair store fails to repair the microwave, which of the following is the most accurate statement?

Options:

A: The woman has a cause of action against the repair store, but only if the handyman does not pay the repair bill.
B: The woman has a cause of action against the handyman and the repair store, but only if the repair is not completed on time.
C: The woman has no cause of action against either the repair store or the handyman.
D: The woman has no cause of action as she agreed to the repair without a specific completion date.
E: The woman has a cause of action against the repair store, but only if they knew she was the true owner of the microwave.
F: The woman has a cause of action against the repair store only.
G: The woman has a cause of action against the handyman, but only if the microwave is not repaired.
H: The woman has a cause of action against the handyman only.

Okay, so I've got this legal question here, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the scenario: A woman needs her microwave repaired. She contacts a handyman who quotes $100 and says he'll have it ready in two weeks. She agrees and gives him the microwave. But then, a week later, the handyman realizes he's too busy, so he takes the microwave to a repair store. The store agrees to repair it for $80 in a week. The store owner didn't know the woman was the actual owner. Now, if the repair store fails to fix the microwave, what happens?

I need to figure out who the woman can sue. The options suggest possibilities involving the handyman, the repair store, both, or neither. Let's think about the contracts and liabilities here.

So, the woman contracted with the handyman. They had an agreement where the handyman promised to repair the microwave for $100 and deliver it in two weeks. Now, the handyman decided he couldn't do it on time, so he subcontracted the work to the repair store. The store didn't know the woman was the owner, but the handyman still took the microwave there.

I remember that when someone contracts to do a job and then delegates the work to another party, the original contractor remains responsible unless the delegation was properly transferred. But in this case, the handyman just took the microwave to the repair store; he didn't inform the woman about it. So, the woman didn't agree to have the repair store do the work. That means the handyman hasn't transferred his obligation; he's just trying to get help, but he's still responsible for the repair.

If the repair store fails to repair the microwave, the handyman is still liable to the woman because the delegation doesn't relieve him of his original duty. The woman can hold the handyman accountable for not fulfilling his contract. As for the repair store, since they didn't know she was the owner, and the handyman didn't inform them, they might not have any direct liability to her. She didn't contract with them directly, so it's unclear if she can sue them. But wait, the repair store did the work for the handyman, so if they messed up, the handyman would be the one to pay, but the woman's claim is against the handyman for breach of contract, not the repair store unless the store's actions somehow directly affect her.

Wait, but the question says the repair store fails to repair. If that happens, the microwave isn't fixed. So the woman hasn't received the service she paid for. The handyman is the one who's supposed to deliver the repaired microwave, so if the repair store doesn't fix it, the handyman is in breach. The woman can sue the handyman for not fulfilling his contract. As for the repair store, since they had a contract with the handyman, but not with the woman, she can't directly sue them unless there's some other reason, like if they were acting as her agent without her knowledge. But they didn't know she was the owner, so probably no.

Wait, but maybe the repair store's failure to repair would mean the handyman can't fulfill his contract, so the woman can sue the handyman. The repair store isn't liable to her because she never had a contract with them. So the answer would be that she can sue the handyman only.

Looking at the options, option H says the woman has a cause of action against the handyman only. Option I says both, but I don't think she can sue the repair store because they weren't her contract party. Option A suggests she can sue the repair store only if the handyman doesn't pay the bill, but that's about the handyman's liability, not hers.

So the correct answer should be H: The woman has a cause of action against the handyman only.

The woman contracted with the handyman, who remained responsible for the repair despite subcontracting to the repair store. Since the repair store didn't have a contract with her, she can't sue them. Therefore, she can only sue the handyman.

Answer: H
