Okay, so I've got this problem about mixing silver alloys, and I need to figure out how many ounces of the first alloy I need to mix with the second to get a certain percentage. Let me think through this step by step.

Alright, the problem says: I have an alloy that's 28% silver, and I need to mix it with 24 ounces of another alloy that's 8% silver. The goal is to produce a new alloy that's 20% silver. I need to find out how many ounces of the 28% alloy I need to add.

Hmm, I remember this is a mixture problem, probably involving some kind of equation where the total amount of silver before and after mixing stays the same. Let me try to set it up.

Let's denote the amount of the 28% alloy as x ounces. So, I'm mixing x ounces of 28% silver with 24 ounces of 8% silver. The total volume after mixing will be x + 24 ounces.

Now, the amount of pure silver in the first alloy would be 28% of x, which is 0.28x. The amount of silver in the second alloy is 8% of 24 ounces, which is 0.08 * 24. Let me calculate that: 0.08 * 24 is 1.92 ounces.

So, the total silver in the mixture will be 0.28x + 1.92 ounces. This total silver should equal 20% of the total mixture, which is 20% of (x + 24). So, 20% is 0.20, so that's 0.20*(x + 24).

Putting it all together, the equation is:

0.28x + 1.92 = 0.20(x + 24)

Now, let me solve for x.

First, expand the right side: 0.20x + 0.20*24. 0.20*24 is 4.8, so the equation becomes:

0.28x + 1.92 = 0.20x + 4.8

Now, subtract 0.20x from both sides to get:

0.08x + 1.92 = 4.8

Then, subtract 1.92 from both sides:

0.08x = 4.8 - 1.92

What's 4.8 minus 1.92? Let's see, 4.8 is the same as 4.80, subtract 1.92. 4.80 - 1.00 is 3.80, minus 0.92 is 2.88. So:

0.08x = 2.88

Now, divide both sides by 0.08:

x = 2.88 / 0.08

Let me calculate that. 2.88 divided by 0.08. Well, 0.08 goes into 2.88 how many times? Let's think in terms of fractions. 0.08 is 8 hundredths, so 2.88 divided by 0.08 is the same as 2.88 * (100/8) = 2.88 * 12.5.

Alternatively, 2.88 รท 0.08: Let's multiply numerator and denominator by 100 to eliminate decimals: 288 รท 8. 8 goes into 28 three times (8*3=24), remainder 4. Bring down the 8: 48. 8 goes into 48 six times. So 36. So, x = 36.

Wait, that makes sense. So, I need 36 ounces of the 28% alloy.

Looking at the options, option F is 36 ounces.

To solve the problem, set up an equation where the total silver from both alloys equals the silver in the final alloy. Let x be the ounces of the 28% alloy. The equation is:

0.28x + 0.08(24) = 0.20(x + 24)

Simplify and solve for x to find x = 36 ounces.

Answer: F
