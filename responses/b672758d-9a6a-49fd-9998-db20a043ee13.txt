Okay, so I need to figure out what percentage agriculture contributed to India's GDP in 2015. I'm not exactly sure about the exact number, but I can think through it.

First, I remember that in recent years, India's economy has been growing, and the services sector has been a big part of that growth. I think services, like IT and other business services, make up a large portion of the GDP. So maybe the agriculture sector isn't the largest anymore.

Agriculture used to be a bigger part of the economy in India, but I believe it's been decreasing over time as the country industrializes and services expand. In the past, I think it was around 20-30%, but I'm not sure if it's lower now.

Looking at the options, I see choices like 64%, 55%, 40%, 8%, 10%, 50%, 22%, 16%, 32%, and 28%. 

I know that by 2015, India's economy was more diversified. Services were a major contributor, probably around 50-60%, maybe even more. Industry, including manufacturing and construction, also contributed a significant chunk. That leaves agriculture to be a smaller percentage.

From what I've heard, around 2012-2015, agriculture was still important but not as dominant. I think it was somewhere between 10-20%. So looking at the options, 16% (H) and 22% (G) are in that range. 

Wait, I think I read a report once that said agriculture's share was about 14-15% around 2015. But that's not one of the options. The closest higher option is 16% (H). Alternatively, maybe it's 16%, or perhaps the actual number was a bit higher.

Another angle: I remember that the agricultural sector in India employs a large portion of the population, but its contribution to GDP is less because of low productivity and the shift towards services and industry. So if services are around 50%, industry maybe 25%, that leaves about 25% for agriculture and other sectors. But 25% isn't an option either.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the data. Let's think differently. I know that in 2016, the agricultural sector's contribution was around 16-17%. So in 2015, it might have been similar. Looking at the options, 16% is H, and 22% is G. So H seems more accurate.

Alternatively, maybe it's 22%. I'm a bit confused. I think I need to recall specific reports. The World Bank data might help. I think in 2015, India's agricultural value added was around 16-17% of GDP. So the closest option is H:16%.

But wait, I'm not 100% sure. Another possibility is that the number is higher, like 22%, but I'm more confident it's around 16%.

The agricultural sector's contribution to India's GDP in 2015 was approximately 16%. This aligns with reports indicating a gradual decline from higher percentages in previous years due to the growth of services and industry. 

Answer: H
