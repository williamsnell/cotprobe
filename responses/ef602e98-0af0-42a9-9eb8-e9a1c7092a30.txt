Okay, let me try to figure out this problem step by step. So the equation given is 3 raised to the power of (x minus 3) plus 10 equals 19. Hmm, I think I should start by isolating the exponential part. 

First, I'll subtract 10 from both sides to get rid of that constant term. So, subtracting 10 from 19 gives me 9. Now the equation is 3^(x-3) = 9. 

Wait, 3 to what power gives me 9? I remember that 3 squared is 9 because 3 times 3 is 9. So, 3^2 equals 9. That means the exponent (x-3) must be equal to 2. 

So, setting up the equation: x - 3 = 2. To solve for x, I just need to add 3 to both sides. Adding 3 to both sides gives me x equals 5. 

Let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Plugging x=5 back into the original equation: 3^(5-3) + 10 equals 3^2 +10, which is 9 +10, and that indeed equals 19. Yep, that checks out. 

Looking at the options, H is 5. So the answer should be H.

The equation simplifies to 3^(x-3) = 9, which leads to x = 5.

Answer: H
