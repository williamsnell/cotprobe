Unknown to the owner, the buyer had intendedto offer only $2,000 per acre but had mistakenly typed "$2,200." As both parties knew, comparable land in thevicinity had been selling at prices between $2,000 and $2,400 per acre. Which of the following states the probable legal consequences of the correspondence between theparties?

A: There is a contract formed at a price of $2,400 per acre, as it is the highest price in the vicinity.
B: There is a contract, but the price per acre will be determined by a third-party appraiser.
C: There is no contract, because the parties attached materially different meanings to the price term.
D: There is no enforceable contract, because the buyer is entitled to rescission due to a mutual mistake asto a basic assumption.
E: There is no contract, because the buyer can argue that the price was a typo.

Okay, so I need to figure out this contract law question. Let me read it carefully.

The situation is that a buyer sent a letter to the owner offering to pay $2,200 per acre for the parcel. The owner replied accepting the offer. But here's the twist: the buyer actually intended to offer $2,000 per acre but made a typo. Both parties knew that comparable land was selling between $2,000 and $2,400 per acre.

So, the question is about the legal consequences of this correspondence. The options are A through J, and I need to pick the correct one.

First, I should recall the basic principles of contract law regarding offer and acceptance. When an offer is made and accepted, a contract is formed. However, there are exceptions, like mutual mistake or unilateral mistake.

In this case, the buyer made a mistake in typing the price. The buyer intended $2k but wrote $2,200. The owner accepted the $2,200 offer, not knowing about the typo. Now, did a contract form at $2,200, or is there a mistake that affects the contract's validity?

I think about unilateral mistakes. Generally, a unilateral mistake (where only one party makes a mistake) doesn't void a contract unless it's a basic assumption that both parties should have been aware of. But here, the buyer made the mistake, and the owner didn't know. So, does the owner's lack of knowledge matter?

Wait, but the buyer intended $2k, and the correct price is within the vicinity of $2k to $2.4k. So, $2,200 is within that range. Maybe the buyer's typo doesn't change the fact that a contract was formed at the higher figure. Because the owner accepted the offer as written, the contract is at $2,200. The buyer's intention might not matter here because the offer was clear, and the owner accepted it. So, the contract is formed at $2,200.

Looking at the options, J says there's a contract at $2,200 regardless of the buyer's true intention. That seems to fit. But wait, what about mutual mistake? No, it's a unilateral mistake because only the buyer was mistaken. Mutual mistake would require both parties to be wrong about a fact, which isn't the case here.

Another point: if the typo was a mutual mistake, like both parties thought it was $2k but it was written as $2,200, but that's not the case. Only the buyer made the mistake.

So, the contract is at $2,200 because the owner accepted the offer as written. The buyer's intention doesn't change the terms once the offer is accepted. So, the correct answer is J.
</think>

The buyer made a unilateral mistake by typing $2,200 instead of $2,000, but the owner accepted the offer as written. A contract is formed at the price stated in the offer, $2,200, regardless of the buyer's intent. 

Answer: J
