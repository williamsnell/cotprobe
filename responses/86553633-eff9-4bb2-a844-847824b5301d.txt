Okay, so I've got this question about Little's argument regarding abortion and maternal prerogative. Let me try to unpack it step by step.

First, the question is asking why Little argues that we should accept a prerogative for mothers to end a pregnancy until the fetus becomes a person. The options are A through J, each presenting a different reason.

I remember that the debate around abortion often revolves around when a fetus becomes a person and what that means for its moral status. Little, I think, is someone who's discussed the ethics of abortion, possibly leaning towards the side that allows abortion before a certain point because the fetus isn't yet a person.

Looking at the options:

Option A says abortion is presumptively wrong but permissible in extreme cases. That sounds more like a pro-life stance where abortion is generally wrong but allowed in exceptions, like if the mother's life is in danger. But the question is about accepting a prerogative, so maybe it's more about the mother's choice rather than exceptions. Not sure yet.

Option B states the fetus isn't a person until it can live independently. That aligns with the idea that until birth, the fetus doesn't have the status of a person, so the mother can decide. This seems relevant because if the fetus isn't a person, then maybe the mother's rights take precedence.

Option C is that the decision rests with the mother. That's a common argument, emphasizing bodily autonomy. But the question is about Little's specific reasoning, which might be more about personhood rather than just the mother's choice.

Option D says the moral status of the fetus is irrelevant. I think that's more of a utilitarian perspective, where the fetus's status doesn't matter as much as the consequences. But I'm not sure if Little takes that stance.

Option E talks about declining radical changes to practical identity. That's a bit abstract. I'm not certain how this connects to abortion. Maybe about personal identity theory, but I don't think that's the main point here.

Option F says it's permissible to abort before the fetus becomes a person. That sounds like a direct statement of Little's view. If the fetus isn't a person, then abortion is permissible. So this is a possible answer.

Option G is about the right to control one's body, which is a key feminist argument. But again, the question is about Little's reasoning, which might focus more on personhood than just bodily autonomy.

Option H suggests there's no clear answer about the moral status. That's more of an agnostic position, not the specific reasoning we're looking for.

Option I claims abortion is absolutely wrong, which is the opposite of what we're considering here.

Option J refers to a legal right, which is more about the law rather than the moral argument Little is making.

So putting this together, Little's argument is likely based on the idea that until the fetus becomes a person, the mother has the right to choose. That would point towards either B or F.

Option B says the fetus isn't a person until independent life, which is a factual statement about when personhood begins. Option F is the conclusion that abortion is permissible before personhood, which is the moral stance.

The question is asking why we should accept the mother's prerogative. So Little would argue that because the fetus isn't a person yet, it's permissible to abort. Therefore, the reason is that the fetus isn't a person until independent life, which is option B. But wait, the question is about the reason for accepting the prerogative, so the reasoning is about personhood, which makes option B the reason.

Alternatively, option F is the conclusion, but the question is why we should accept the prerogative, so the reasoning is because the fetus isn't a person until then, so option B is the reason, and F is the conclusion based on that.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up. The question is asking what Little argues as the reason. So Little's argument is that because the fetus isn't a person until it can live independently, the mother can end the pregnancy. So the reason is B.

But wait, looking back, the question is phrased as "because" followed by the reason. So the reason is B, which explains why the mother's prerogative exists. So the answer would be B.

Wait, but let me check. The question is: Little argues we should accept the mother's prerogative until the fetus is a person because... So the reason is why, which is the basis for the argument. So the reason is that the fetus isn't a person until it can live independently. So the answer is B.

The correct answer is B: the fetus is not a person until it is capable of independent life. This is because Little's argument hinges on the idea that until the fetus becomes a person, the mother retains the prerogative to end the pregnancy, as the fetus lacks the moral status of a person. 

Answer: B
