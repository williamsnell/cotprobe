Question:

Jack picks 60 apples from an apple tree. He uses 12 of them to make applesauce. He places the remaining apples equally into 6 gift baskets. Which equation can be used to determine the numberof apples, a, that Jack places into each gift basket?

Options:

A: (60-6)-12=a
B: (60+12)/6=a
C: (60—12)/6=a
D: (60/12) - 6 = a
E: (60 + 6)/12 = a
F: (60 + 12) - 6 = a
G: (60 - 12)*6 = a
H: (60/6) + 12 = a
I: (60 - 6)/12 = a
J: (60/6)—12=a

Okay, so I have this problem where Jack picks 60 apples. He uses 12 of them to make applesauce. Then he puts the remaining apples equally into 6 gift baskets. I need to find which equation represents the number of apples, a, in each basket.

First, let me break down the problem step by step. Jack starts with 60 apples. He uses 12 for applesauce. So the first thing is to subtract 12 from 60 to find out how many apples are left after making applesauce. That would be 60 minus 12, which equals 48 apples remaining.

Now, he places these remaining 48 apples equally into 6 gift baskets. To find out how many apples go into each basket, I need to divide the remaining apples by the number of baskets. So that's 48 divided by 6, which equals 8 apples per basket.

So the equation should represent this process. Let me look at the options.

Option C is (60 - 12)/6 = a. That makes sense because it subtracts the 12 apples first and then divides by 6 baskets. Let me check the other options just to be sure.

Option A: (60 - 6) - 12 = a. Wait, that would be subtracting 6 and then 12, which doesn't match the problem. Jack used 12, not 18.

Option B: (60 +12)/6 = a. That adds 12, which doesn't make sense because he used 12, so we should subtract, not add.

Option D: (60/12) -6= a. Dividing 60 by 12 gives 5, then subtracting 6 would give a negative number, which can't be right.

Option E: (60 +6)/12 =a. Again, adding instead of subtracting, so wrong.

Option F: (60+12)-6 =a. That adds 12 and subtracts 6, which is 66-6=60, but that's not dividing by baskets.

Option G: (60-12)*6 =a. That would multiply, which would be 48*6=288, which is way too high and doesn't make sense.

Option H: (60/6)+12=a. 60 divided by 6 is 10, plus 12 is 22, which is not right because we subtract first.

Option I: (60-6)/12=a. That subtracts 6, which isn't the correct number of apples used. He used 12, so this is wrong.

Option J: (60/6)-12=a. 60/6 is 10, minus 12 gives -2, which is impossible.

So, the correct equation is definitely Option C: (60 -12)/6 =a.

The correct equation is (60 - 12)/6 = a, which is option C.

Answer: C
