Okay, so I'm trying to figure out what Lyotard's dictum means. The question is about his statement, "I define postmodern as incredulity toward meta-narratives." I remember that Lyotard was a French philosopher associated with postmodernism. 

Meta-narratives, I think, refer to grand, overarching stories or theories that try to explain everything. Like, big systems such as Marxism, Freudianism, or even something like the idea of progress. So, when he says "incredulity toward meta-narratives," he's suggesting skepticism or distrust towards these big, all-encompassing stories.

Looking at the options, let's go through each one. 

Option A: Postmodernism disregards individual stories. That doesn't seem right. I think postmodernism actually values diverse individual narratives rather than dismissing them.

Option B: Universal values are meaningless. This could be related because if you're skeptical of meta-narratives, you might question universal values that these grand stories often promote. But I'm not sure if this is exactly what Lyotard is saying.

Option C: Literature reproduces repression. That sounds more like a Marxist or feminist critique, not directly about meta-narratives.

Option D: The concept of truth is objective and undeniable. Lyotard's statement seems to question the idea of a single objective truth, so this is probably the opposite of what he's saying.

Option E: The law is static. I don't think this connects to meta-narratives; laws being static is more about governance, not grand theories.

Option F: Individual stories are suspect. Wait, that's the opposite of what I thought earlier. If postmodernism distrusts big narratives, does it mean it's skeptical of individual ones too? Or does it mean that it's more about accepting multiple, smaller narratives?

Option G: Postmodernism promotes the acceptance of all narratives. That sounds a bit too broad. I think it's more about being skeptical of the grand ones, not necessarily accepting all.

Option H: Postmodernism rejects all forms of authority. This could be related because meta-narratives often serve as authoritative frameworks, so rejecting them would mean rejecting that authority.

Wait, so Lyotard is saying that postmodernism is characterized by a lack of belief in these big, all-encompassing stories. So, meta-narratives are those big systems that claim to explain everything, and being incredulous towards them means not taking them at face value. 

So, looking at the options again, which one aligns with that. Option F says individual stories are suspect. That might not be correct because postmodernism often emphasizes the validity of individual experiences and stories, not that they're suspicious.

Option H says postmodernism rejects all forms of authority. If meta-narratives are a form of authority, then maybe this is correct. But does it reject all authority, or just the grand narratives? I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, the dictum is about being incredulous towards meta-narratives, not necessarily all authority. So maybe H is too broad. 

Another angle: the idea that there's no single truth, which aligns with being skeptical of meta-narratives that claim to have the ultimate truth. So, D says truth is objective and undeniable, which would be the opposite. So D is incorrect.

So back to the options, the correct interpretation is that postmodernism is suspicious of large-scale theories that claim to explain everything. So, which option reflects that? 

Option F says individual stories are suspect. No, that's not it. It's the meta-narratives that are suspect, not individual stories.

Option H says postmodernism rejects all forms of authority. Maybe, but perhaps that's too strong. Lyotard is specifically talking about meta-narratives, which are a type of authority, but does that mean all authority? I'm not sure.

Wait, another way: the statement is about not believing in meta-narratives, which are grand theories. So, it's about skepticism towards these big stories. So, the answer would be that it's about distrust towards these large narratives, not individual ones. So looking again, the options:

A: Disregard individual stories. No, because it's about meta, not individual.

B: Universal values are meaningless. Maybe, because universal values are part of meta-narratives.

H: Rejects all authority. Maybe, but perhaps more specifically about meta-narratives.

Wait, the question is asking what the dictum means. The statement is that postmodernism is characterized by a lack of belief in meta-narratives. So, meta-narratives are the grand theories that try to explain everything, like the idea of progress, or the belief in a single true religion, etc.

So, the correct interpretation is that postmodernism is suspicious of these big stories. So, looking at the options, which one matches that.

Option F: Individual stories are suspect. No, because it's the meta that's suspect, not individual.

Option H: Rejects all forms of authority. That might be too broad. Maybe H is stretching it.

Wait, another way: when you're incredulous towards meta-narratives, you don't accept them as true. So, the idea that there's one objective truth (option D) is being rejected. So, D is incorrect.

So, the correct answer is that postmodernism is skeptical of these big narratives. So, looking back, the options:

Which option says that meta-narratives are distrusted? None of the options directly say that, but perhaps the closest is H: Postmodernism rejects all forms of authority. Because meta-narratives are a form of authority, so rejecting them would mean rejecting that authority.

Alternatively, option F: Individual stories are suspect. No, that doesn't fit.

Wait, another way: the statement is about not believing in meta-narratives. So, it's about being skeptical of grand theories. So, the answer is that postmodernism is skeptical of these big stories, which are meta-narratives. So, looking at the options, which one reflects that.

Option F says individual stories are suspect. That doesn't align. Option H says it rejects all authority, which might be a possible interpretation, but perhaps F is about individual stories being suspect, which doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again.

Lyotard's statement is about not believing in meta-narratives. So, meta-narratives are the big stories that try to explain everything. So, the statement is that postmodernism is characterized by a lack of belief in these big stories.

So, the options:

A: Disregards individual stories. No, the opposite.

B: Universal values are meaningless. Maybe, because universal values are part of meta-narratives.

H: Rejects all forms of authority. Maybe, but perhaps more accurately, it's about rejecting grand narratives that impose authority.

Wait, the correct answer is that postmodernism is skeptical of these grand narratives. So, looking at the options, which one reflects that.

Option F: Individual stories are suspect. No, because it's the meta that are suspect.

Option H: Rejects all forms of authority. Maybe, but perhaps H is too broad.

Wait, another angle: meta-narratives are systems that claim to have the truth, so being incredulous towards them means not accepting that there's a single objective truth. So, option D says the concept of truth is objective and undeniable, which is the opposite. So D is incorrect.

So, maybe the correct answer is B: Universal values are meaningless. Because universal values are part of the meta-narratives that postmodernism distrusts.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is H: Postmodernism rejects all forms of authority. Because meta-narratives are a form of authority, so rejecting them would mean rejecting that authority.

Wait, but H says "all forms of authority," which might be too broad. Lyotard is specifically talking about meta-narratives, not all authority.

Hmm. Maybe I should look up the options again.

Options:

A: Postmodernism disregards individual stories.

B: Universal values are meaningless.

C: Literature reproduces repression.

D: The concept of truth is objective and undeniable.

E: The law is static.

F: Individual stories are suspect.

G: Postmodernism promotes the acceptance of all narratives.

H: Postmodernism rejects all forms of authority.

The statement is about being suspicious of meta-narratives, which are big stories that claim to explain everything. So, it's about not believing in these big systems.

So, the correct interpretation is that postmodernism is skeptical of these grand, authoritative narratives.

Looking at the options, H says it rejects all forms of authority. That might be the closest, but perhaps more accurately, it's about rejecting the authority of meta-narratives, not necessarily all authority.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is F: Individual stories are suspect. But that doesn't seem right because postmodernism often celebrates individual narratives.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think differently. The term "incredulity towards meta-narratives" means not taking these big stories for granted. So, it's about not believing in them. So, the answer would be that postmodernism is skeptical of these big stories.

Looking at the options, the one that fits is H: Postmodernism rejects all forms of authority. Because meta-narratives are a type of authority, so if you're skeptical of them, you're rejecting that form of authority.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is F: Individual stories are suspect. But that's not correct because it's the meta that are suspect, not the individual.

Wait, I'm stuck. Another approach: which option is the opposite of meta-narratives. Since meta-narratives are big, the opposite is individual. So, the statement is about distrusting the big ones, not the small ones. So, the answer is not about individual stories being suspect, but about the big ones.

So, the options don't directly say that, but the best fit is H: Postmodernism rejects all forms of authority. Because meta-narratives are a form of authority, so rejecting them would mean rejecting that authority.

Wait, but does it mean rejecting all authority? Or just the meta-narrative kind? I'm not entirely sure, but perhaps H is the intended answer.
</think>

Lyotard's statement emphasizes skepticism toward "meta-narratives," which are grand, overarching theories that claim to explain everything. This means postmodernism distrusts these large, authoritative frameworks. Among the options, **H: Postmodernism rejects all forms of authority** aligns most closely with this idea, as meta-narratives are a form of authority. While the statement focuses specifically on meta-narratives, interpreting it within the given options, H is the most fitting answer.

H
