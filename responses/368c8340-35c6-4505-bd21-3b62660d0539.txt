Okay, so I've got this question about demodulating a single tone-modulated signal. The signal given is m(t) = cos(ω_m t). The task is to find the demodulated single sideband output g(t). There are several options provided, from A to J, each with different expressions involving cosines or sines and varying coefficients and phase terms.

Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my modulation techniques, but I'll try to think this through. So, single sideband modulation (SSB) is a type of amplitude modulation where only one sideband is transmitted, along with the carrier if desired. But in SSB, typically the carrier is suppressed, so it's more efficient in terms of bandwidth.

When you modulate a carrier wave with a message signal using SSB, the resulting signal has just one sideband. The demodulation process should then recover the original message signal.

Wait, but in this question, it's about the demodulated output. So after the signal has been transmitted through an SSB modulator, what does the demodulator do?

I remember that SSB demodulation usually involves using a local oscillator to mix the received signal, then using a low-pass filter to extract the baseband signal. The process involves heterodyning: mixing the received signal with the local oscillator to shift the frequency down, then filtering to get the baseband.

Alternatively, sometimes the demodulator for SSB uses a product detector or a synchronous demodulator. But I'm not entirely sure about the exact steps, so maybe I should think about the math.

The general form of an SSB signal is something like S(t) = A cos(ω_c t) + B cos(ω_c t + 2φ) or something like that. Wait, no, more accurately, the SSB signal can be written as either cos(ω_c t + β cos(ω_m t)) or cos(ω_c t - β cos(ω_m t)), depending on upper or lower sideband.

But when you demodulate, you multiply the received signal with the carrier (or a locally generated carrier) and then pass it through a low-pass filter. So the demodulation process for SSB typically involves:

1. Mixing the received signal with the carrier (same frequency as the original carrier) to shift it down to baseband.
2. Applying a low-pass filter to remove any high-frequency components, leaving the original message.

Let me try to model this. Let's say the received signal is s(t) = cos(ω_c t ± β cos(ω_m t)). When you multiply this by the local carrier cos(ω_c t), you get:

s(t) * cos(ω_c t) = cos(ω_c t ± β cos(ω_m t)) * cos(ω_c t).

Using the trigonometric identity: cos A cos B = [cos(A+B) + cos(A-B)] / 2.

So expanding that:

= [ cos(ω_c t ± β cos(ω_m t) + ω_c t) + cos(ω_c t ± β cos(ω_m t) - ω_c t) ] / 2.

Simplify the arguments:

First term: cos(2ω_c t ± β cos(ω_m t)).

Second term: cos(∓ β cos(ω_m t)).

Wait, because when you subtract ω_c t from (ω_c t ± β cos(ω_m t)), you get ±β cos(ω_m t) - 0, so it's cos(±β cos(ω_m t)), but cosine is even, so cos(±x) = cos(x). So the second term becomes cos(β cos(ω_m t)).

But the first term, cos(2ω_c t ± β cos(ω_m t)), has a frequency of 2ω_c, which is much higher than the message frequency ω_m. So when you pass this through a low-pass filter, only the second term (cos(β cos(ω_m t))) will pass through, because its frequency is around 0 (the DC term), but wait, no, cos(β cos(ω_m t)) is a modulated cosine, which is actually a frequency-modulated signal, but wait, no, I think I'm getting confused here.

Wait, no, the original message is m(t) = cos(ω_m t), which when modulated, produces a signal with sidebands at ω_c ± ω_m. After demodulation, the process should recover the original m(t).

Wait, perhaps I should think about the demodulation process more carefully. Let's model it step by step.

The received SSB signal is s(t) = cos(ω_c t ± β cos(ω_m t)). Let's take the lower sideband for this example, so s(t) = cos(ω_c t - β cos(ω_m t)).

In the demodulator, we multiply s(t) by the local carrier cos(ω_c t):

s(t) * cos(ω_c t) = cos(ω_c t - β cos(ω_m t)) * cos(ω_c t).

Using the product-to-sum formula:

= [ cos( (ω_c t - β cos(ω_m t)) + ω_c t ) + cos( (ω_c t - β cos(ω_m t)) - ω_c t ) ] / 2.

Simplify the arguments:

First term: cos(2ω_c t - β cos(ω_m t)).

Second term: cos(-β cos(ω_m t)) = cos(β cos(ω_m t)), since cosine is even.

Now, the first term has a frequency of 2ω_c, which is much higher than the message frequency ω_m. The second term is cos(β cos(ω_m t)), which is a time-varying function with frequencies around ω_m.

But wait, the second term is cos(β cos(ω_m t)), which is a signal that's amplitude-modulated, but it's actually a form of frequency modulation. Hmm, but that's not correct because the original message is a cosine, so perhaps the demodulation process should extract that.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me think again.

The original message is m(t) = cos(ω_m t). When you modulate it using SSB, the modulated signal is s(t) = cos(ω_c t ± β m(t)).

So s(t) = cos(ω_c t ± β cos(ω_m t)).

When you multiply s(t) by cos(ω_c t) in the demodulator, you get:

s(t) * cos(ω_c t) = cos(ω_c t ± β cos(ω_m t)) * cos(ω_c t).

Expanding this gives:

= [ cos(2ω_c t ± β cos(ω_m t)) + cos(∓ β cos(ω_m t)) ] / 2.

Wait, but cos(2ω_c t ± β cos(ω_m t)) is a high-frequency term, which after the low-pass filter would be removed, leaving us with cos(∓ β cos(ω_m t)) / 2.

But cos is even, so cos(∓x) = cos(x), so this simplifies to cos(β cos(ω_m t)) / 2.

Wait, but that's not the original message. The original message is m(t) = cos(ω_m t), but here we have cos(β cos(ω_m t)).

Hmm, that doesn't seem right. So perhaps I'm missing something in the demodulation process.

Wait, maybe I should consider using a different approach, like synchronous demodulation or using a different method to extract the message.

Another approach is to use a phase-sensitive detector. Let me think about that. In a synchronous demodulator, you multiply the received signal by the carrier and then pass it through a low-pass filter. Alternatively, you can use a high-pass filter if the carrier is shifted up, but in this case, perhaps a low-pass filter is used.

Wait, but in my earlier calculation, after multiplying by the carrier, the output is:

[ cos(2ω_c t ± β cos(ω_m t)) + cos(∓ β cos(ω_m t)) ] / 2.

So the high-frequency term is cos(2ω_c t ± β cos(ω_m t)), and the low-frequency term is cos(∓ β cos(ω_m t)).

Wait, but the original message is m(t) = cos(ω_m t), and the modulated signal is s(t) = cos(ω_c t ± β cos(ω_m t)).

After demodulation, we're getting cos(β cos(ω_m t)) / 2, which is not the same as the original message. So perhaps I'm missing a step here, like a second multiplication or a different approach.

Wait, maybe I should think about the amplitude modulation in terms of the Bessel functions expansion. When you modulate a cosine with another cosine, you get a signal with multiple sidebands, but in SSB, only one sideband is transmitted.

Alternatively, perhaps the demodulation process involves taking the real part after mixing and filtering, but I'm not quite getting it right.

Wait, another approach: consider the envelope of the modulated signal. For SSB, the envelope should follow the message signal. So the demodulation could involve taking the square of the modulated signal and then taking the square root, but that seems a bit too simplified.

Wait, let's think about the message m(t) = cos(ω_m t). When modulated using SSB, the output is s(t) = cos(ω_c t ± β cos(ω_m t)). The demodulation process should extract the β cos(ω_m t) term from this.

Wait, perhaps the key is to realize that when you multiply s(t) by the carrier and pass through a low-pass filter, you get something proportional to the original message.

Wait, let me try this again. The demodulation process is:

s(t) = cos(ω_c t ± β m(t)).

Multiply by cos(ω_c t):

s(t) * cos(ω_c t) = cos(ω_c t ± β m(t)) * cos(ω_c t).

Using the product identity:

= [ cos( (ω_c t ± β m(t)) + ω_c t ) + cos( (ω_c t ± β m(t)) - ω_c t ) ] / 2.

Simplify:

First term: cos(2ω_c t ± β m(t)).

Second term: cos(± β m(t)).

So, after low-pass filtering, the first term is at 2ω_c, which is high frequency and is filtered out. The second term is cos(± β m(t)).

But since cos is even, cos(± β m(t)) = cos(β m(t)).

Wait, but the original message is m(t) = cos(ω_m t), so cos(β m(t)) = cos(β cos(ω_m t)), which is a different function. That's not the same as m(t). So how does this lead to the original message?

Ah, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the modulation process. Wait, maybe the demodulation isn't just a simple multiplication and filtering. Perhaps there's an additional step, like using a phase-locked loop or another technique.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to use a coherent demodulation method. Let me think about that.

In coherent demodulation, you multiply the received signal by the carrier and then pass it through a low-pass filter. The result should give you the original message, but scaled by some factor.

Wait, perhaps I should model it using trigonometric identities more carefully.

Let me consider the received SSB signal as s(t) = cos(ω_c t - β cos(ω_m t)).

Multiply by cos(ω_c t):

s(t) * cos(ω_c t) = cos(ω_c t - β cos(ω_m t)) * cos(ω_c t).

Expanding using the identity:

= [ cos( (ω_c t - β cos(ω_m t)) + ω_c t ) + cos( (ω_c t - β cos(ω_m t)) - ω_c t ) ] / 2.

Simplify the arguments:

First term: cos(2ω_c t - β cos(ω_m t)).

Second term: cos(-β cos(ω_m t)) = cos(β cos(ω_m t)).

So after the low-pass filter, only the second term remains: cos(β cos(ω_m t)) / 2.

Hmm, but the original message is m(t) = cos(ω_m t), so this isn't matching. Wait, perhaps the demodulation process includes taking the real part after another step, like differentiation or something else.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider the Taylor expansion of cos(β cos(ω_m t)).

The Taylor series for cos(x) is 1 - x²/2! + x^4/4! - ..., so cos(β cos(ω_m t)) would be 1 - (β² cos²(ω_m t))/2! + (β^4 cos^4(ω_m t))/4! - ... .

But that's getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the amplitude modulation in terms of the message signal.

Wait, perhaps the demodulated output is proportional to the original message. Let me think, if the modulated signal is s(t) = cos(ω_c t - β cos(ω_m t)), then when we multiply by the carrier and filter, we get cos(β cos(ω_m t)) / 2. But that's not the same as the original message.

Wait, maybe I'm confusing amplitude modulation with angle modulation. In amplitude modulation, the carrier's amplitude varies with the message, but in SSB, it's a form of angle modulation (like phase or frequency modulation), but actually no, SSB is an amplitude modulation technique where only one sideband is transmitted.

Wait, no, SSB is a type of amplitude modulation. So in SSB, the carrier is suppressed, and only one sideband is transmitted. The modulation is done by varying the amplitude of the sideband.

Wait, perhaps the confusion arises from the method of demodulation. Let me think again: after multiplying by the carrier and filtering, the output is cos(β cos(ω_m t)) / 2.

But the original message is m(t) = cos(ω_m t). So how does cos(β cos(ω_m t)) relate to m(t)?

Alternatively, perhaps the demodulation process is more involved, and the output after the filter is passed through another stage, like a square root or something, to recover m(t). But that's not one of the options given.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the options and see which one makes sense.

Looking at the options, the answer should be a function involving cos(ω_m t ± something), probably with a coefficient.

Option G is y(t) = (Ar/2) cos(ω_m t ± Δφ).

Option I is y(t) = (Ar/2) cos(ω_m t).

Option C is y(t) = (Ar/4) cos(ω_m t ± Δφ).

Wait, but in our earlier calculation, the demodulated output was cos(β cos(ω_m t)) / 2. But none of the options directly match that. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.

Wait, perhaps the demodulation process is different. Maybe the correct approach is to use a different method, like using a high-pass filter instead of a low-pass filter. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps the demodulation involves taking the imaginary part after mixing. Let me try that.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the demodulator uses a synchronous detection, where the received signal is multiplied by the carrier and then low-pass filtered. So after filtering, the output is proportional to the message.

Wait, but earlier I thought that leads to cos(β cos(ω_m t)) / 2, which doesn't directly give m(t). So perhaps I'm missing a step where this is further processed.

Alternatively, maybe the demodulation involves using a phase-sensitive detector, which might involve taking the derivative or integrating the signal. But that's getting more advanced.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to recognize that the demodulated output is proportional to the original message. Let me think about the options.

Option I is y(t) = (Ar/2) cos(ω_m t). That's a simple cosine with the same frequency as the message. That seems plausible.

Option G is y(t) = (Ar/2) cos(ω_m t ± Δφ). That includes a phase shift, which might come from the modulation and demodulation process.

Wait, in our earlier calculation, after demodulation, the output was cos(β cos(ω_m t)) / 2. But that's not a simple cosine of ω_m t. Unless β is 1, in which case it's cos(cos(ω_m t)), which isn't the same as cos(ω_m t). So perhaps my earlier approach is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the demodulation process for SSB with a single-tone message results in a scaled version of the original message.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the correct demodulation output is proportional to the original message, scaled by a factor. Looking at the options, options G and I have cos(ω_m t) terms, which matches the original message's frequency.

If the demodulation correctly recovers the message, then the output should be proportional to cos(ω_m t). So looking at the options, option I is y(t) = (Ar/2) cos(ω_m t). Option G includes a phase shift, which might be due to the modulation process, but if the demodulation is coherent and perfect, the phase could be zero.

Wait, but then why is there a phase shift in some options? Maybe the modulation introduces a phase shift, and the demodulation must account for that, but perhaps in the ideal case, the phase shift cancels out.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option I, where y(t) is proportional to cos(ω_m t).

Wait, but looking back at the options, option I is y(t) = (Ar/2) cos(ω_m t). That seems like it would be the case if the demodulation correctly extracts the message without any phase shift.

Wait, but earlier I thought that after demodulation, the output was cos(β cos(ω_m t)) / 2, which isn't the same. So perhaps I'm missing something here.

Wait, perhaps the initial assumption is that the modulation is done such that the demodulation results in a linear scaling of the message. Let me think differently: perhaps the modulated signal is s(t) = cos(ω_c t) * [1 + r m(t)], where r is the modulation index. But that's for amplitude modulation, not SSB.

Wait, no, in SSB, the signal is s(t) = cos(ω_c t ± β m(t)). So in this case, m(t) = cos(ω_m t), so s(t) = cos(ω_c t ± β cos(ω_m t)).

When demodulating, as we did earlier, the output after the low-pass filter is cos(β cos(ω_m t)) / 2. But that's not the same as m(t). So perhaps there's a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the demodulation process isn't just a simple multiplication and filtering. Maybe a different approach is needed, like using a phase-locked loop or another method to track the phase of the carrier.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct way is to use a second multiplication with a 90-degree phase shift, leading to a different expression.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the demodulation process for SSB involves using a local oscillator that's phase-locked to the carrier, and then using a synchronous detector. In that case, the output would be proportional to the original message.

Wait, but without getting too deep into the mathematics, perhaps the correct answer is option I: y(t) = (Ar/2) cos(ω_m t), because that directly recovers the original message's frequency.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option G: y(t) = (Ar/2) cos(ω_m t ± Δφ), where Δφ is a phase shift introduced during modulation and demodulation. But if the demodulation is done perfectly, the phase shift would be zero, leading to option I.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck here. Let me think about the options again.

Looking at the options, option G is (Ar/2) cos(ω_m t ± Δφ), which includes a phase shift. Option I is (Ar/2) cos(ω_m t), which doesn't. If the modulation process introduces a phase shift that's not canceled out during demodulation, then option G would be correct. But if the demodulation is coherent and correctly tracks the phase, then the phase shift would be zero, leading to option I.

Wait, but in the demodulation process I considered earlier, the output was cos(β cos(ω_m t)) / 2, which isn't the same as the original message. So perhaps I'm missing a step where this is further processed to extract the original message.

Wait, maybe the correct approach is to use a high-pass filter instead of a low-pass filter. Let me try that.

If after multiplying by the carrier, we pass through a high-pass filter instead, then the high-frequency term cos(2ω_c t ± β cos(ω_m t)) would pass through, but that's at 2ω_c, which is higher than the message frequency. So that doesn't help.

Alternatively, perhaps the demodulation process involves taking the difference between the upper and lower sidebands, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the option where the output is proportional to cos(ω_m t). Among the options, option I and G have cos(ω_m t), while others have different frequencies or phase shifts.

Given that, option I seems plausible. But let me think again about the demodulation process.

Wait, perhaps the correct demodulation of an SSB signal with a single cosine message would result in an output proportional to the original message. So if m(t) = cos(ω_m t), then the demodulated output y(t) should also be proportional to cos(ω_m t).

Looking at the options, option I is y(t) = (Ar/2) cos(ω_m t), which fits this condition.

But earlier I thought that the demodulation would result in cos(β cos(ω_m t)) / 2, which doesn't match. So perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the modulation process.

Wait, maybe the correct expression for the SSB modulated signal is s(t) = cos(ω_c t) + cos(ω_c t ± 2ω_m t), but that doesn't seem right either.

Alternatively, perhaps the demodulation process involves a different approach, such as using a Hilbert transform or another method, but that's probably beyond the scope of this question.

Given the options and the reasoning that the demodulated output should be proportional to the original message's frequency, I think the correct answer is option I: y(t) = (Ar/2) cos(ω_m t).
</think>

For a single tone-modulated signal \( m(t) = \cos(\omega_m t) \), the demodulated single sideband (SSB) output \( g(t) \) can be determined by analyzing the modulation and demodulation process. In SSB modulation, the carrier is suppressed, and only one sideband is transmitted. During demodulation, the received signal is multiplied by the local carrier and passed through a low-pass filter to recover the original message.

The received SSB signal is of the form \( s(t) = \cos(\omega_c t \pm \beta \cos(\omega_m t)) \). When this signal is multiplied by the local carrier \( \cos(\omega_c t) \), the result is:

\[
s(t) \cdot \cos(\omega_c t) = \cos(\omega_c t \pm \beta \cos(\omega_m t)) \cdot \cos(\omega_c t).
\]

Using the trigonometric identity \( \cos A \cos B = \frac{1}{2} [\cos(A+B) + \cos(A-B)] \), the product can be expanded as:

\[
\frac{1}{2} [\cos(2\omega_c t \pm \beta \cos(\omega_m t)) + \cos(\pm \beta \cos(\omega_m t))].
\]

The term \( \cos(2\omega_c t \pm \beta \cos(\omega_m t)) \) is at a high frequency and is removed by the low-pass filter. The remaining term is:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \cos(\pm \beta \cos(\omega_m t)).
\]

Since \( \cos \) is an even function, \( \cos(\pm \beta \cos(\omega_m t)) = \cos(\beta \cos(\omega_m t)) \). For the original message \( m(t) = \cos(\omega_m t) \), the demodulated output should ideally be proportional to \( \cos(\omega_m t) \). Among the given options, the one that matches this condition is:

\[
y(t) = \frac{Ar}{2} \cos(\omega_m t).
\]

This corresponds to **Option I**, which correctly recovers the original message without any phase shift or additional modulation terms.
