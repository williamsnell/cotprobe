Okay, so I've got this problem about mixing three different liquids at different temperatures. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, I'll read the problem again to make sure I understand it. There are three liquids with temperatures 15°C, 20°C, and 25°C. When equal masses of the first two (15 and 20) are mixed, the result is 18°C. When equal masses of the last two (20 and 25) are mixed, the result is 24°C. Now, I need to find the temperature when equal masses of the first and last liquids (15 and 25) are mixed. 

Hmm, since the masses are equal, I can assume the mass is the same for both, let's say m. So for the first case, mixing 15°C and 20°C:

The formula for mixing two masses is (m1*T1 + m2*T2)/(m1 + m2). Since m1 = m2 = m, this simplifies to (15 + 20)/2 = 35/2 = 17.5°C. But wait, the problem says when equal masses are mixed, the final temperature is 18°C. That's a bit higher than 17.5. That suggests that maybe the specific heats aren't the same for the liquids. Oh, right, because different substances have different specific heats. So I can't just take the average; I need to consider the specific heat capacities.

Let me denote the specific heats as c1, c2, c3 for the three liquids. But wait, the problem doesn't give me any info about the specific heats. Hmm, maybe I can set up equations based on the mixing results.

When equal masses of the first two (15°C and 20°C) are mixed, the final temp is 18°C. So the heat lost by the hotter liquid equals the heat gained by the cooler one, considering equal mass. Since mass is same, the heat transfer depends on specific heat and temperature change.

So, for the first mixture: m*c1*(18 -15) = m*c2*(20 -18). The m cancels out, so 3*c1 = 2*c2 → 3c1 = 2c2 → equation 1: c2 = (3/2)c1.

Similarly, when equal masses of the last two (20°C and 25°C) are mixed, the final temp is 24°C. So the heat lost by the hotter (25°C) equals heat gained by the cooler (20°C). 

So, m*c2*(25 -24) = m*c3*(24 -20). Again, m cancels. 1*c2 =4*c3 → equation 2: c3 = c2/4.

Now, using equation 1, c2 is (3/2)c1. So substituting into equation 2: c3 = (3/2)c1 /4 = (3/8)c1.

Now, the question is to find the final temp when equal masses of first (15°C) and third (25°C) are mixed. Let's denote the final temp as T.

Heat lost by the third liquid (25°C) will equal the heat gained by the first (15°C). So,

m*c1*(T -15) = m*c3*(25 - T). Again, m cancels.

So, c1(T -15) = c3(25 - T).

We know c3 is (3/8)c1, so substituting:

c1(T -15) = (3/8)c1 (25 - T).

We can cancel c1 from both sides (assuming c1 ≠ 0):

T -15 = (3/8)(25 - T).

Let me solve this equation for T.

Multiply both sides by 8 to eliminate the denominator:

8(T -15) = 3(25 - T).

Expanding both sides:

8T - 120 = 75 - 3T.

Bring all T terms to one side and constants to the other:

8T +3T = 75 +120.

11T = 195.

So, T = 195 / 11. Let me calculate that. 11*17=187, 195-187=8. So 17 + 8/11 → 17.727... which is approximately 17.727°C, but wait, that doesn't make sense because when mixing 15 and 25, the temp should be between 15 and 25. Wait, 195/11 is about 17.727, which is below 15, which can't be possible because 25 is higher than 15. Wait, that can't be right. Did I make a mistake in the setup?

Wait, let me check the setup again. When mixing 15 and 25, the heat lost by 25 should equal the heat gained by 15. So, the equation should be:

m*c1*(T -15) = m*c3*(25 - T). That's correct. Then substituting c3=3/8 c1, so:

c1(T-15) = (3/8 c1)(25-T). So yes, that's correct. So when I cancel c1, I get:

T-15 = (3/8)(25 - T).

So, 8(T-15) =3(25 - T).

8T -120 =75 -3T.

Adding 3T to both sides: 11T -120 =75.

Adding 120: 11T=195 → T=195/11 ≈17.727°C.

Wait, but that's lower than 15°C, which doesn't make sense because the hotter liquid is 25°C. The final temp should be between 15 and 25. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I mixed up the heat transfer direction. Let me think again. When mixing 15 and 25, the 25°C liquid will lose heat, and the 15°C will gain heat. So the equation is correct. But getting a lower temp than 15 implies that perhaps the specific heat of the third liquid is much higher, allowing it to absorb more heat. Wait, but according to our earlier calculations, c3 is (3/8)c1, which is less than c1. So maybe I made a mistake in the earlier steps.

Wait, let me double-check the earlier steps.

First mixture: 15 and 20 give 18°C.

So, m*c1*(18-15) = m*c2*(20-18) → 3c1=2c2 → c2=1.5c1.

Second mixture: 20 and 25 give 24°C.

So, m*c2*(25-24)=m*c3*(24-20) → c2*(1) = c3*(4) → c3 = c2/4 = (1.5c1)/4 = 0.375c1.

So c3=3/8 c1.

Now, when mixing 15 and 25, with masses m each, the heat balance is:

m c1 (T -15) = m c3 (25 - T)

Divide both sides by m:

c1 (T-15) = c3 (25-T)

Substitute c3=3/8 c1:

c1 (T-15) = (3/8 c1)(25-T)

Divide both sides by c1 (since c1≠0):

T-15 = (3/8)(25-T)

Multiply both sides by 8:

8T -120 = 3*(25 - T) → 8T -120 =75 -3T

Bring like terms together:

8T +3T =75 +120 →11T=195 → T=195/11 ≈17.727°C.

Hmm, but that's impossible because the final temp can't be lower than the initial temp of the cooler liquid. So I must have made a mistake in the setup.

Wait a minute, perhaps I should have set it up differently. Maybe the heat lost by the hotter equals the heat gained by the cooler, but perhaps the specific heats are different, so the coefficients matter.

Wait, another approach: Let me denote the specific heats as c1, c2, c3.

From the first mixing (15 and 20 to 18):

The heat lost by the 20°C liquid is m c2 (20-18)=2 m c2.

The heat gained by the 15°C liquid is m c1 (18-15)=3 m c1.

Since heat lost = heat gained, 2 m c2 =3 m c1 → 2c2=3c1 → c2= (3/2)c1.

Second mixing (20 and 25 to 24):

Heat lost by 25°C: m c3 (25-24)=1 m c3.

Heat gained by 20°C: m c2 (24-20)=4 m c2.

So 1 m c3 =4 m c2 → c3=4 c2.

But from earlier, c2=1.5 c1 → c3=4*(1.5 c1)=6 c1.

Wait, that's different from what I had before. Did I make a mistake earlier? Because in the second mixing, the final temp is 24°C, which is between 20 and 25. So the heat lost by 25 is (25-24)=1, and the heat gained by 20 is (24-20)=4. So 1*c3 =4*c2 → c3=4 c2.

Wait, earlier I thought it was 1*c2=4*c3, but that's wrong. It should be 1*c3 =4*c2 → c3=4 c2.

Wait, no, wait. The heat lost by the hotter liquid (25) is m c3 (25-T) and the heat gained by the cooler (20) is m c2 (T-20). Since T is 24, it's m c3*(25-24)=m c3*(1) and m c2*(24-20)=m c2*(4). So 1*c3 =4*c2 → c3=4 c2.

But earlier I thought it was c3= c2/4, which is wrong. So that's where I made a mistake.

So, let me correct that.

From the first mixing: c2= (3/2)c1.

From the second mixing: c3=4 c2 =4*(3/2)c1 =6 c1.

So now, when mixing 15 and 25, with equal masses, the final temp T.

Heat lost by 25: m c3 (25-T).

Heat gained by 15: m c1 (T-15).

So, m c3 (25-T) = m c1 (T-15).

Cancel m: c3 (25-T) = c1 (T-15).

But c3=6 c1, so substitute:

6 c1 (25-T) = c1 (T-15).

Divide both sides by c1 (c1≠0):

6(25-T) = T-15.

Expand 6*25=150, 6*(-T)= -6T.

So 150 -6T = T -15.

Bring all T terms to left and constants to right:

-6T - T = -15 -150 → -7T = -165 → 7T=165 → T=165/7 ≈23.571°C.

Wait, that makes more sense because it's between 15 and 25. Now, let me compute 165/7. 7*23=161, so 165-161=4, so T=23 and 4/7°C, which is option C: 23 (4/7) °C.

Wait, but let me check the calculations again to make sure.

Wait, in the second mixing, I had 20 and 25 giving 24°C. So the heat lost by 25 is 1 unit (25-24=1) multiplied by c3, and the heat gained by 20 is 4 units (24-20=4) multiplied by c2. So 1*c3 =4*c2 → c3=4c2. Then from first mixing, c2=1.5 c1 → c3=4*1.5 c1=6 c1.

So when mixing 15 and 25: heat lost by 25 is c3*(25-T) =6 c1*(25-T).

Heat gained by 15 is c1*(T-15).

So 6c1*(25-T) =c1*(T-15).

Divide by c1: 6*(25-T)=T-15 → 150-6T=T-15 → 150+15=7T → 165=7T → T=165/7=23.571°C, which is 23 and 4/7°C. So the correct answer is option C.

The problem involves determining the final temperature when equal masses of the first and third liquids (15°C and 25°C) are mixed. By analyzing the given data and setting up heat transfer equations, we find that the specific heat of the third liquid is six times that of the first. Using this relationship, the final temperature is calculated to be 23 (4/7)°C.
