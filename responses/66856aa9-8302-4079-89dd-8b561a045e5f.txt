Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about logical fallacies, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let's break it down step by step.

The question is asking about a fallacy where someone decides on a conclusion first and then only accepts evidence that supports it, or interprets all evidence as confirming that conclusion. Hmm, that sounds familiar. I remember learning about different types of fallacies in my logic class, so let's try to recall.

The options are A through D: ad ignorantium, a priori, plurium interrogationum, and Extension. Wait, no, actually the options are A to J, but in the given question, it's A to D. Wait, no, looking again, the options are A to D as per the user's message: A: ad ignorantium, B: a priori, C: plurium interrogationum, D: Extension. Wait, no, the user wrote options as A through J but the actual options are A, B, C, D. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me check again.

Wait, the user wrote the options as A through J but then listed them as A: ad ignorantium, B: a priori, C: plurium interrogationum, D: Extension. So the options are four: A, B, C, D.

So the fallacy described is where someone starts with a conclusion and then only looks for supporting evidence. That sounds like confirmation bias, but I'm not sure if that's one of the options here.

Wait, let's think about each option:

A: ad ignorantium – I think that's the argument from ignorance, where someone assumes something is true because it hasn't been proven false. Not exactly what the question is describing.

B: a priori – that's reasoning from prior knowledge or theory, not necessarily a fallacy. It's a method of reasoning, not a fallacy.

C: plurium interrogationum – that's the many questions fallacy, where someone asks a series of questions that can't be answered without admitting something. Not matching the scenario.

D: Extension – Not sure about this one. Maybe it's referring to the extension fallacy, but I'm not certain.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. The fallacy where someone starts with a conclusion and then seeks only evidence to support it is called "confirming evidence bias," but that's not one of the options. Alternatively, it could be the "appeal to belief" or "appeal to consensus," but those aren't listed here.

Wait, another thought: the term "a priori" sometimes refers to reasoning that starts from a conclusion and works backward. But that's not a fallacy per se, just a method. However, if someone uses a priori reasoning in a way that they only accept evidence that supports their initial conclusion, that might fit. Or perhaps the fallacy is "begging the question," which is assuming what you're trying to prove.

Wait, maybe the fallacy is called "one-sided reasoning." But that's not an option here. Alternatively, "cherry picking," which is selecting only the data that supports a conclusion. But again, not listed.

Wait, looking back at the options, maybe the correct answer is A: ad ignorantium? No, that doesn't fit. Or perhaps it's D: Extension. Wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the fallacy is "appeal to emotion," but that's not the case here.

Wait, another angle: the question describes a situation where the conclusion is determined first, and then evidence is selectively accepted. That sounds like a form of bias rather than a specific fallacy. Maybe it's the "conclusion-first" approach, which is a type of fallacy.

Wait, perhaps the fallacy is known as "a priorism," but I'm not sure if that's one of the options. Looking at the options again, B is a priori, which is a method, not a fallacy. So maybe the answer is not among these options, but perhaps I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, perhaps the fallacy is called "confusing correlation with causation," but that's not it either.

Wait, maybe I should think about the structure of the fallacy. The person decides on the conclusion first, then looks for evidence to support it. That's similar to the "affirming the consequent" or "denying the antecedent," but those are specific types of syllogistic fallacies.

Alternatively, the fallacy might be "post hoc ergo propter hoc," but that's about cause and effect, not about selecting evidence.

Wait, perhaps the correct term is "the nail is on the anvil" fallacy, but that's not one of the options.

Wait, maybe the answer is A: ad ignorantium. No, that doesn't fit. Let me think again.

Wait, in the options, the only one that might fit is D: Extension. But I'm not sure what Extension refers to in this context. Maybe it's referring to extending a claim beyond the evidence, but that's not exactly the same as selecting evidence.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The fallacy where you start with the conclusion and then seek evidence to support it is called "confirmatory bias," but that's not an option. Alternatively, it's "theorizing from a conclusion," but again, not an option.

Wait, perhaps the answer is A: ad ignorantium. No, that's about ignorance, not evidence selection.

Wait, maybe I'm confusing it with the "appeal to consequences" fallacy, but that's about the consequences of a belief being used as evidence, not about selecting evidence.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is not listed here, but since I have to choose from the given options, I need to pick the closest one. Alternatively, maybe I'm missing the correct term.

Wait, another approach: the fallacy is about only accepting evidence that supports the conclusion, which is a form of confirmation bias. But since that's not an option, perhaps the answer is A: ad ignorantium, but I don't think so.

Wait, perhaps the fallacy is called "presumption," but that's not listed.

Alternatively, maybe it's "appeal to authority," but that's not it either.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is B: a priori. Because a priori reasoning starts with a conclusion and works backward, but that's a method, not a fallacy. So maybe the fallacy is when a priori reasoning is misapplied, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the fallacy is "ignoring the opposite," but that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps the answer is A: ad ignorantium, but I'm not confident.

Wait, another thought: the fallacy is called "the fallacy of the selected evidence," but I'm not sure if that's one of the options.

Alternatively, maybe it's "appeal to emotion," but that's not relevant here.

Wait, I'm stuck. Let me try to think of the options again.

A: ad ignorantium – argument from ignorance.

B: a priori – reasoning from theory.

C: plurium interrogationum – many questions.

D: Extension – not sure.

Wait, perhaps the answer is A: ad ignorantium. No, that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe the answer is D: Extension. But I'm not sure what that refers to.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is none of the above, but since I have to choose, I'll have to go with the best guess.

Wait, I think the fallacy described is called "the confirmatory approach" or "one-sided argument," but since those aren't options, perhaps the answer is A: ad ignorantium. But I'm not confident.

Wait, perhaps the answer is C: plurium interrogationum. No, that's about asking too many questions.

Wait, maybe it's D: Extension. Maybe it's referring to the extension fallacy, which is when someone extends a claim beyond its scope, but that's not exactly the same as selecting evidence.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is B: a priori, but that's a method, not a fallacy.

Wait, I'm really not sure. Maybe I should think of it as a form of bias rather than a fallacy. But the question refers to it as a fallacy, so it must be one of the options.

Wait, perhaps the answer is A: ad ignorantium. No, that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the answer is D: Extension. Maybe Extension refers to the extension fallacy, which involves extending a claim beyond the evidence. But that's not exactly the same as selecting evidence to support a conclusion.

Wait, I'm stuck. I think the correct answer is A: ad ignorantium, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps it's B: a priori, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I should look up the fallacy. The fallacy where someone starts with a conclusion and then only accepts evidence that supports it is known as "the confirmatory approach," but that's not an option. Alternatively, it's "one-sided reasoning," but again, not an option.

Wait, perhaps the answer is A: ad ignorantium. No, that's about lack of evidence.

Wait, maybe the answer is D: Extension. I'm going to go with that, but I'm not certain.

The fallacy described involves starting with a desired conclusion and then selectively accepting only evidence that supports it. After considering the options, the answer that best fits, despite some uncertainty, is:

D: Extension

Answer: D
