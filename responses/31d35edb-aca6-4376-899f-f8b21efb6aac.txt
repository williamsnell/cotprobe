Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, Katie is going on vacation for 3 weeks, and she wants to find out how many days of work she'll miss. She does this by multiplying 5 by 3. Hmm, wait, 5 times 3 equals 15. But wait, 3 weeks is 21 days, right? Oh, wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Maybe she's calculating something else. Let me read the question again.

Wait, the question says she's multiplying 5 × 3 to find the number of days she'll miss. So, 5 times 3 is 15. So, she's expecting to miss 15 days of work. But wait, 3 weeks is 21 days. That doesn't add up. Maybe she's only missing 5 days each week? Or perhaps she's taking a 3-week vacation but only missing work for 5 days each week. Wait, that would be 5 days a week times 3 weeks, which is 15 days. So, maybe she works 5 days a week and takes 3 weeks off, but perhaps she's only missing 5 days each week, but that doesn't make sense because if she's on vacation, she wouldn't be working those weeks. Alternatively, maybe she's taking 3 days off each week, but that's not matching the multiplication.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The key is that she's using 5 × 3 to find the number of days she'll miss. So, regardless of the context, 5 × 3 is 15. Now, the question is asking for another expression that equals 15, which would show another way she can compute the same result.

Looking at the options:

A: 5 + 3 + 3 = 11. No, that's not 15.

B: 3 + 3 + 3 = 9. No.

C: 5 × 5 = 25. No.

D: 5 × 3 × 3. That's 5 × 9 = 45. No.

E: 5 × 2 × 3. That's 5 × 6 = 30. No.

F: 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5. That's 5 added five times, which is 25. No.

G: 5 + 5 + 5. That's 15. Oh, yes, that's correct.

H: 3 × 4 +5 = 12 +5 =17. No.

I: 3 +5=8. No.

J: 3×3×3=27. No.

So the correct expression that equals 15 is option G: 5 +5 +5.

The correct expression is G: 5 + 5 + 5.

Answer: G
