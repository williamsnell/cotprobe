Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the absolute minimum value of the function f(x, y) = x² + y², but it's subject to the constraint x² + 2y² = 1. Hmm, I remember from my calculus class that when you have a function to optimize with a constraint, you can use something called Lagrange multipliers. Let me try to recall how that works.

First, the function f(x, y) is what I want to minimize. The constraint is g(x, y) = x² + 2y² - 1 = 0. So, according to the method, I need to set the gradient of f equal to λ times the gradient of g. That gives me two equations from the partial derivatives.

The gradient of f is (2x, 2y), and the gradient of g is (2x, 4y). So, setting them up:

2x = λ * 2x
2y = λ * 4y

Wait, maybe I should write that more carefully. So,

∂f/∂x = 2x = λ * ∂g/∂x = λ * 2x
∂f/∂y = 2y = λ * ∂g/∂y = λ * 4y

So from the first equation, 2x = λ * 2x. If I subtract, I get 2x(1 - λ) = 0. So either x = 0 or λ = 1.

From the second equation, 2y = λ * 4y. Rearranging, 2y - 4λ y = 0 → y(2 - 4λ) = 0. So either y = 0 or λ = 2/(4) = 0.5.

Now, let's think about the possible cases.

Case 1: x = 0.

If x = 0, then from the constraint equation x² + 2y² = 1, we get 0 + 2y² = 1 → y² = 1/2 → y = ±√(1/2) = ±(√2)/2.

So plugging into f(x, y), f(0, y) = 0 + y² = 1/2. So that's 0.5.

Case 2: y = 0.

If y = 0, then from the constraint, x² + 0 = 1 → x = ±1.

Then f(x, 0) = x² + 0 = 1. So that's 1.

Case 3: λ = 1.

Wait, let me check. If λ = 1, then from the second equation, 2y = 1 * 4y → 2y = 4y → 2y = 0 → y = 0. But that's the case where y=0, which we already considered in case 2. So no new information there.

Case 4: λ = 0.5.

If λ = 0.5, then from the first equation, 2x = 0.5 * 2x → 2x = x → 2x - x = 0 → x = 0. So that brings us back to case 1 where x=0.

Wait, so maybe the only critical points are when either x=0 or y=0, leading to f=0.5 or f=1, respectively.

So comparing these, 0.5 is less than 1, so the minimum is 0.5.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing any other possibilities. Are there other points where both x and y are non-zero, and λ is neither 0.5 nor 1? Hmm, maybe not, because the equations lead to either x=0 or λ=1, and λ=1 leads to y=0. So the only possible points are when x=0 or y=0, which are the cases we considered.

Alternatively, I could try using substitution. Let me see. The constraint is x² + 2y² = 1. So perhaps I can solve for x² in terms of y²: x² = 1 - 2y². Then substitute into f(x, y):

f = x² + y² = (1 - 2y²) + y² = 1 - y².

So f(y) = 1 - y². Now, to find the minimum of this, I need to find the maximum of y² because f decreases as y² increases. But under the constraint, y² can't be more than 1/2 because from x² = 1 - 2y², x² must be ≥ 0, so 1 - 2y² ≥ 0 → y² ≤ 1/2.

So the maximum y² can be is 1/2, which would make f = 1 - (1/2) = 1/2. So the minimum value of f is 0.5.

Wait, that's the same result as before. So that seems to confirm it.

Alternatively, I could think geometrically. The function f(x, y) = x² + y² is the square of the distance from the origin to the point (x, y). The constraint is an ellipse given by x² + 2y² = 1. The closest point on the ellipse to the origin would give the minimum value of f. 

Looking at the ellipse, along the x-axis, it goes up to (1, 0), so f=1 there. Along the y-axis, the ellipse reaches y = ±√(1/2), so f=0.5 there. That makes sense because the point (0, √(1/2)) is closer to the origin than (1,0).

So, putting it all together, the minimum value is 0.5, which is option E.

The problem requires finding the absolute minimum of \( f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 \) subject to the constraint \( x^2 + 2y^2 = 1 \). Using the method of Lagrange multipliers and substitution, the minimum value is determined to be 0.5.
