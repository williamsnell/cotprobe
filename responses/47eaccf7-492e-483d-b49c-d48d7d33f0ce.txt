Okay, so I've got this question about logical fallacies, and I need to figure out the right answer. The question is asking which fallacy occurs when someone assumes that a general rule applies to a specific situation, even though it might not. The options are A through D, and I need to pick the correct one.

First, I should probably remember what each of these fallacies means. Let me think about each option one by one.

Option A is False Dilemma. I remember that this fallacy happens when someone presents a situation as having only two possible options when, in reality, there are more. It's like saying you're either with us or against us, ignoring other possibilities. So that doesn't seem to fit the question here.

Option B is Circular Reasoning. Circular reasoning is when the conclusion is based on a premise that is itself based on the conclusion. It's like saying "I'm right because I'm right." This isn't about applying a general rule to a specific case, so probably not this one.

Option C is Accident. I think this is the fallacy where a general rule is applied to an exception. For example, saying "Birds can fly" and then applying it to a penguin, which is a bird but can't fly. So this seems to fit the question because it's taking a generalization and applying it without considering exceptions.

Option D is Bifurcation. From what I recall, bifurcation is similar to the false dilemma but maybe a bit different. It's when someone divides an issue into two parts when there are actually more aspects to consider. For example, saying something is either all good or all bad. But again, this isn't about applying a general rule to a specific case.

So putting it all together, the question is about applying a general rule to a particular case without considering exceptions. That sounds exactly like the Accident fallacy. So the answer should be C.

The correct answer is **C: Accident**. This fallacy occurs when a general rule is applied to a specific case without considering that the case might be an exception.

Answer: C
