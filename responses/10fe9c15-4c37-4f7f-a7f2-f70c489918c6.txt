Okay, so I have this algebra problem here. It says that the expression -2x² -20x -53 should be written in the form a(x + d)² + e. Then I need to find the sum of a + d + e. Hmm, I remember that this process is called completing the square. Let me try to work through it step by step.

First, the original expression is -2x² -20x -53. I want to write this in the form a(x + d)² + e. So, I think I should factor out the coefficient of x² from the first two terms. That would be -2, right? Let me do that.

So, factoring -2 out from -2x² -20x gives me: -2(x² + 10x) -53. Wait, because -2 times x² is -2x², and -2 times 10x is -20x. That's correct.

Now, inside the parentheses, I have x² + 10x. To complete the square, I need to add and subtract the square of half the coefficient of x. The coefficient of x here is 10, so half of that is 5, and squaring it gives 25. So I should add and subtract 25 inside the parentheses.

But wait, since I'm adding inside the parentheses, and there's a factor of -2 outside, I have to be careful with how that affects the overall expression. Let me write it out.

So, after adding and subtracting 25 inside, it becomes: -2[(x² + 10x + 25) - 25] -53. Wait, no, that's not right. Because when you factor out a negative, adding and subtracting inside would change the signs. Let me think again.

Actually, when I factor out -2, I have -2(x² + 10x) -53. To complete the square, I add and subtract (10/2)² = 25 inside the parentheses. But since there's a factor of -2 outside, adding 25 inside is like adding -2*25, which would change the overall expression. So I need to adjust by adding the same amount inside to balance it.

Wait, maybe a better way is to write it as -2[(x² + 10x + 25) -25] -53. Because I'm adding 25 inside the parentheses, but since it's multiplied by -2, it's like subtracting 50. So to balance, I need to add 50 outside. Let me check:

-2[(x +5)^2 -25] -53 = -2(x+5)^2 +50 -53. So, combining the constants, 50 -53 is -3. So the expression becomes -2(x +5)^2 -3.

Wait, let me verify this. Expanding -2(x +5)^2 -3 should give me the original expression. Let's see:

-2(x² +10x +25) -3 = -2x² -20x -50 -3 = -2x² -20x -53. Yes, that's correct.

So now, the expression is in the form a(x + d)^2 + e, where a is -2, d is 5, and e is -3.

Wait, but in the form a(x + d)^2 + e, the d is the term added inside the square. So when I have (x +5)^2, that's (x + d)^2, so d is 5. So a is -2, d is 5, and e is -3.

Now, the question asks for the sum a + d + e. So let's compute that: (-2) + 5 + (-3) = (-2) +5 is 3, then 3 + (-3) is 0. So the sum is 0. Looking at the options, option A is 0.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Sometimes when dealing with negative signs, it's easy to slip up.

Starting again, the original expression is -2x² -20x -53. Factor out -2 from the first two terms: -2(x² +10x) -53.

To complete the square inside the parentheses, take half of 10, which is 5, square it to get 25. So I add and subtract 25 inside the parentheses. But since I'm factoring out -2, adding 25 inside is like adding (-2)*25 = -50. So to balance, I need to add +50 outside.

Wait, but in my earlier step, I had -2[(x+5)^2 -25] -53, which expands to -2(x+5)^2 +50 -53, which is -2(x+5)^2 -3. That seems correct.

So a is -2, d is +5, e is -3. So sum is (-2) +5 + (-3) = 0. So the answer should be A: 0.

The expression is rewritten by factoring out -2 and completing the square, resulting in -2(x + 5)² - 3. The constants are a = -2, d = 5, and e = -3. Their sum is (-2) + 5 + (-3) = 0.
