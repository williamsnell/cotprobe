Okay, so I have this accounting problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to solve it. Let me read it again carefully.

The problem says that Corporation XY had sales in 197X amounting to $3,000,000. The cost of goods sold is $1,500,000. Administrative expenses are $300,000, depreciation is $800,000, and all other expenses are $100,000. Retained earnings are $100,000. The income tax rate is 48%, and they want to know how much dividend is declared. Then, if the tax rate falls to 45%, how much could be declared?

The options are from A to J, each giving two numbers, one for each scenario.

Hmm, so I think this is about calculating dividends based on retained earnings and taxable income. Wait, no, retained earnings are part of the equity, but here they give retained earnings as $100,000. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I think I need to calculate the company's net income for the year. To find net income, I subtract all the expenses from the sales. Let me list out the numbers:

Sales: $3,000,000
Cost of goods sold (COGS): $1,500,000
Administrative expenses: $300,000
Depreciation: $800,000
Other expenses: $100,000

So total expenses would be the sum of these. Let me add them up:

COGS: 1.5M
Admin expenses: 0.3M
Depreciation: 0.8M
Other: 0.1M
Total expenses = 1.5 + 0.3 + 0.8 + 0.1 = $2,700,000

Wait, that's $2.7 million in expenses. So the gross profit would be sales minus COGS, right? Or wait, no, because COGS is part of the cost of goods sold, but other expenses like admin and depreciation are operating expenses. Wait, no, wait. Normally, to get EBIT (Earnings Before Interest and Taxes), you subtract COGS and operating expenses from sales. Then, interest and taxes come next.

Wait, but in this problem, maybe it's a simpler approach. Let me think: the problem doesn't mention interest expenses, so perhaps we can ignore them for now. So, the net income would be calculated as:

Net Income = Sales - COGS - Administrative Expenses - Depreciation - Other Expenses - Taxes

Wait, but taxes depend on the taxable income, which is the income before taxes. So first, I need to calculate EBIT, then subtract taxes, and then perhaps interest if any. But since there's no mention of interest, maybe it's just EBIT.

Wait, perhaps the steps are:

1. Calculate EBIT: Sales - COGS - Administrative Expenses - Depreciation - Other Expenses.

Wait, no, because COGS is part of the cost of goods sold, which is subtracted from sales to get gross profit. Then, other expenses are subtracted to get EBIT. Let me clarify:

Gross Profit = Sales - COGS
= 3,000,000 - 1,500,000 = $1,500,000

Then, subtract other expenses: Administrative ($300k), Depreciation ($800k), and Other ($100k). So total of $1,200,000 in expenses.

So EBIT = Gross Profit - Operating Expenses
= 1,500,000 - (300,000 + 800,000 + 100,000)
= 1,500,000 - 1,200,000
= $300,000

Wait, that seems low. Let me check:

300k (admin) + 800k (depreciation) + 100k (other) = 1,200k. So yes, 1.5M - 1.2M = 0.3M, so EBIT is $300,000.

Then, we have to consider taxes. The tax rate is 48%. So, taxes would be 48% of EBIT, assuming no other deductions or credits.

Taxes = 300,000 * 0.48 = $144,000

So, Net Income = EBIT - Taxes
= 300,000 - 144,000 = $156,000

Wait, but wait a second. Retained earnings are given as $100,000. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Retained earnings are part of the equity section and represent the profits that have been reinvested in the company. So, if the net income is $156,000, and the retained earnings are $100,000, does that mean that the company paid dividends of $56,000? Because retained earnings would be the net income minus dividends.

Wait, but the problem says "retained earnings are $100,000." That might not be the net income. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me think again.

Wait, no, retained earnings are the profits that have been kept by the company after paying dividends. So, if the net income is $156,000, and the retained earnings are $100,000, that implies that the company paid dividends of $56,000 because 156k - 56k = 100k. So the dividend declared would be $56,000.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is structured such that the net income is the sum of retained earnings and dividends. So, Net Income = Retained Earnings + Dividends.

If that's the case, and Net Income is $156,000, and Retained Earnings are $100,000, then Dividends = 156,000 - 100,000 = $56,000.

So then, under the first scenario, the dividend is $56,000. Now, the second part is if the tax rate falls to 45%. Let's recalculate.

EBIT remains the same, $300,000.

Taxes now would be 300,000 * 0.45 = $135,000

So Net Income = 300,000 - 135,000 = $165,000

Again, using the same retained earnings of $100,000, the dividends would be 165,000 - 100,000 = $65,000.

So the dividends would be $56,000 when the tax rate is 48% and $65,000 when it's 45%.

Looking at the options, option C is $56,000 and $65,000, which matches.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any miscalculations.

Wait, let me recalculate EBIT:

Sales: 3,000,000

COGS: 1,500,000

Gross Profit: 1,500,000

Expenses: Admin 300k, Depreciation 800k, Other 100k. Total: 1,200,000.

So EBIT: 1,500,000 - 1,200,000 = 300,000. Correct.

Taxes at 48%: 300,000 * 0.48 = 144,000. So Net Income: 300,000 - 144,000 = 156,000.

Retained Earnings: 100,000. So Dividends: 156,000 - 100,000 = 56,000.

At 45% tax: 300,000 * 0.45 = 135,000.

Net Income: 300,000 - 135,000 = 165,000.

Dividends: 165,000 - 100,000 = 65,000.

Yes, that seems correct. So the answer should be option C: $56,000 and $65,000.

The problem involves calculating the dividends declared by Corporation XY under two different income tax rates. 

First, the company's net income is determined by subtracting total expenses from sales. The expenses include cost of goods sold ($1,500,000), administrative expenses ($300,000), depreciation ($800,000), and other expenses ($100,000), totaling $2,700,000. Subtracting these from sales ($3,000,000) gives an earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) of $300,000. 

Applying the 48% tax rate, the tax expense is $144,000, resulting in a net income of $156,000. Given retained earnings of $100,000, the dividends declared are $56,000 ($156,000 - $100,000). 

If the tax rate decreases to 45%, the tax expense becomes $135,000, leading to a net income of $165,000. The dividends in this scenario are $65,000 ($165,000 - $100,000). 

Thus, the dividends declared are $56,000 and $65,000 respectively, corresponding to option C.
