Okay, so I need to figure out where the chicken was first domesticated. The options are A through J, including Russia, Zaire, Australia, Peru, India, Greece, Canada, Egypt, France, and China. Hmm, I remember that chickens are one of the first domesticated birds, but I'm not exactly sure where it happened.

I think the process of domesticating animals often started in regions with agriculture, so maybe somewhere in the Middle East or Asia. Let me think about what I know. Chickens are closely related to red junglefowl, which are found in Southeast Asia. I've heard that the domestication of chickens probably began in that region. So, looking at the options, China is one of them. I think China is in Southeast Asia, so that might be the right answer.

Wait, but I'm not entirely certain. I remember something about India also being a place where chickens were kept, but was it the first? I think the domestication started in China and then spread to other countries like India. So, the first domestication would be in China, not India.

Let me consider the other options quickly. Russia, Zaire, Australia, Peru, Greece, Canada, Egypt, Franceâ€”these don't seem to fit. Chickens were domesticated for their eggs and meat, so it's more likely to be a region with early agriculture. China has a long history of farming, so that makes sense.

I think the answer must be J: China.

The chicken was first domesticated in China, where the red junglefowl, its wild ancestor, is found. China's early agricultural practices likely contributed to this domestication, which then spread to other regions.
