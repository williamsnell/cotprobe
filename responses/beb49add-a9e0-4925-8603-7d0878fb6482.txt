Question:

You are training a linear regression model for a simple estimation task, and notice that the model is overfitting to the data. You decide to add in $\ell_2$ regularization to penalize the weights. As you increase the $\ell_2$ regularization coefficient, what will happen to the bias and variance of the model?

Options:

A: Bias increase ; Variance increase
B: Bias decrease ; Variance increase
C: Neither bias nor variance is affected by $\ell_2$ regularization
D: Variance remains constant ; Bias decreases
E: Bias increase ; Variance decrease
F: Bias remains constant ; Variance increases
G: Both bias and variance remain constant
H: Variance remains constant ; Bias increases
I: Bias decrease ; Variance decrease
J: Bias remains constant ; Variance decreases

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about linear regression models and regularization. Let me break it down step by step.

The question says that I'm training a linear regression model and noticing it's overfitting. Overfitting usually means the model is too complex and captures the noise in the training data, leading to high variance but low bias. Since it's overfitting, the model probably has high variance because it's too sensitive to the training data, and maybe low bias because it's not constrained enough.

To fix this, I decide to add ℓ₂ regularization. ℓ₂ regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function proportional to the square of the weights. I remember that this type of regularization helps prevent the model from becoming too complex by discouraging large weights. So, it should make the model less sensitive to the training data, which I think reduces variance.

Now, the question is about what happens when I increase the ℓ₂ regularization coefficient. The coefficient controls how strong the regularization is. As I increase it, the penalty becomes stronger, so the model's weights are pushed towards zero more than before.

Bias is about how much the model's predictions deviate from the true values because of simplifying assumptions. Variance is the model's sensitivity to fluctuations in the training data. High regularization usually leads to models that are simpler and less prone to capturing noise, which should reduce variance. But what about bias?

If I add more regularization, the model becomes less flexible. It might start to underfit if the regularization is too strong. Underfitting means high bias because the model can't capture the underlying pattern of the data. So, increasing regularization (ℓ₂) should decrease variance because the model is less complex, but it might increase bias because the model is too simple.

Wait, let me think again. When you apply ℓ₂ regularization, you're adding a bias term? No, the bias term is separate. Oh, right, the bias is the intercept term, and ℓ₂ regularization affects the weights, not the bias directly. So, the bias term isn't penalized in ℓ₂. So, increasing ℓ₂ regularization would make the weights smaller but not affect the bias term. So, the model's predictions would rely more on the bias term, which might mean the bias increases because the model is less able to fit the data without relying more on the intercept.

Wait, no. If the weights are being penalized, the model might have a higher bias because it's not capturing the features as strongly, leading to systematic errors (bias). At the same time, the variance would decrease because the model is less sensitive to the training data's fluctuations.

So, putting it together: increasing ℓ₂ regularization should decrease variance (since the model is less complex and overfitting less) and increase bias (since the model is underfitting more). Looking at the options, option E says Bias increase and Variance decrease. That fits.

Wait, but earlier I thought ℓ₂ affects only weights, not bias. So the bias term (intercept) remains the same, but the model's overall bias (systematic error) increases because the weights are smaller. Hmm, maybe I'm conflating the bias term with the model's bias. Let me clarify.

In the context of bias and variance tradeoff: higher regularization (like ℓ₂) leads to models that underfit, which have higher bias and lower variance. So, yes, bias increases and variance decreases.

So the correct answer should be E: Bias increase; Variance decrease.
</think>

When you increase the ℓ₂ regularization coefficient in a linear regression model, the model becomes less complex as the weights are constrained to be smaller. This reduces the model's sensitivity to the training data, thereby decreasing variance. However, the increased regularization can lead to underfitting, which increases bias. Therefore, as the regularization coefficient increases, bias increases and variance decreases.

Answer: E
