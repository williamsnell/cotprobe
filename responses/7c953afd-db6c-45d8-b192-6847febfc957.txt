Okay, so I have this problem about a Poisson process, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step. 

The problem says: Let {N(t), t ∈ [0, ∞)} be a Poisson process with rate λ = 4. X₁ is the first arrival time. Given that N(t) = 1, what is P(X₁ ≤ t/2)?

Hmm, I remember that in a Poisson process, the number of arrivals in any interval of length t follows a Poisson distribution with parameter λt. Also, the times between arrivals (inter-arrival times) are exponentially distributed with parameter λ, and they are independent.

But wait, the problem is conditional. It says given N(t) = 1, so we're looking at the scenario where exactly one arrival has occurred by time t. I need to find the probability that the first arrival happened before t/2 under this condition.

Let me think about the setup. When N(t) = 1, it means there was exactly one arrival in the interval [0, t]. The time of this arrival, X₁, is somewhere between 0 and t. Now, we want to find the probability that X₁ is less than or equal to t/2, given that there was exactly one arrival in [0, t].

I think this is a conditional probability. So, P(X₁ ≤ t/2 | N(t) = 1). 

In a Poisson process, the distribution of the arrival time given that there's exactly one arrival is uniform. Because the process is memoryless, the arrival is equally likely to occur at any point in the interval [0, t]. So, the probability that X₁ is less than or equal to t/2 should be the length of the interval [0, t/2] divided by the total interval [0, t].

So, the probability would be (t/2 - 0) / (t - 0) = (t/2) / t = 1/2. So, 0.5.

Wait, but let me double-check that. Since the arrival is uniformly distributed when conditioned on N(t) = 1, yes, the probability that X₁ ≤ t/2 is indeed the ratio of the intervals, which is 1/2. So, the answer should be 0.5, which is option A.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about it in terms of the Poisson process properties. The probability that the first arrival is before t/2 given that there's exactly one arrival by time t.

Another approach: The conditional probability can be calculated using the definition. P(X₁ ≤ t/2 | N(t)=1) = P(X₁ ≤ t/2 and N(t)=1) / P(N(t)=1). 

But since if X₁ ≤ t/2 and N(t)=1, that means the arrival happened before t/2, and no arrivals after that until t. Wait, but in a Poisson process, the events are independent. So, the probability that the first arrival is before t/2 and that no arrivals happen between t/2 and t.

So, P(X₁ ≤ t/2 and N(t)=1) = P(X₁ ≤ t/2) * P(no arrivals between t/2 and t | X₁ ≤ t/2).

But wait, maybe it's easier to think in terms of the time being split into two intervals: [0, t/2] and (t/2, t]. For N(t)=1, the arrival must be in either the first half or the second half.

The probability that the arrival is in [0, t/2] given that it's in [0, t] is (length of [0, t/2]) / (length of [0, t]) = (t/2)/t = 1/2.

So, yeah, that again gives 0.5.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought sometimes in some processes the distribution might not be uniform. But no, I remember that for a Poisson process, given exactly one arrival in [0,t], the arrival time is uniformly distributed over [0,t]. So, the probability that it's in the first half is 1/2.

Therefore, the answer should be A: 0.5.

The probability that the first arrival occurs before t/2 given exactly one arrival by time t is 0.5 because the arrival time is uniformly distributed over [0, t].
