Okay, so I've got this psychology question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

Shannon forgot her pillow when she went camping, and she ended up complaining about sleeping with her head flat on the ground all night. The key point is that she failed to fold up her jeans and sweater to use as a pillow substitute. The question is asking which psychological concept this best illustrates from the given options.

First, I need to understand each of the options to see which one fits. Let's go through them one by one.

Option A: Functional fixedness. I remember that this is a concept where people have difficulty using objects in ways other than their intended purpose. So, if Shannon didn't think to use her clothes as a pillow because she only saw them as clothes, that might be functional fixedness. That sounds relevant here.

Option B: Availability heuristic. This is about how people estimate the likelihood of events based on how easily examples come to mind. I'm not sure how this applies here directly. Maybe if she thought it was too easy to forget a pillow, but I don't think that's the main issue.

Option C: Overconfidence effect. This is when people overestimate their abilities. While she might not have been overconfident, the question is more about her not thinking of an alternative solution, not her confidence level.

Option D: Representativeness heuristic. This is about judging something based on how well it represents a category. Not sure how that ties in here.

Option E: Confirmation bias. This is about favoring information that confirms existing beliefs. Maybe she didn't consider other options because she was stuck on the idea of needing a pillow, but I'm not certain.

Option F: Framing effect. This is about how presenting information differently affects decisions. Not sure that's relevant here.

Option G: Hindsight bias. This is the "I knew it all along" effect. Doesn't seem applicable.

Option H: Illusion of control. This is when people believe they have more control over events than they actually do. Not sure how that applies here.

Option I: Cognitive dissonance. This is about discomfort from holding conflicting thoughts. She was probably uncomfortable, but the question is about her failure to find a solution, not her mental state.

Option J: Anchoring effect. This is about relying too much on the first piece of information encountered. Doesn't seem to fit.

So, going back to the scenario, Shannon didn't think to use her clothes as a pillow. That sounds like she was fixated on the intended use of her clothes (as clothing) and didn't consider alternative uses. That's textbook functional fixedness. She didn't think outside the box, so to speak.

I think the answer is A: functional fixedness.

The scenario describes Shannon failing to use her clothes as a makeshift pillow because she was unable to think of them in a different context than their usual use. This best illustrates **functional fixedness**, where the mind is fixated on the primary use of an object and struggles to consider alternative uses.

Answer: A
