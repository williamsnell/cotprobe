Okay, so I've got this question about skewness in a dataset. The data is the waist measurements of six chocolate rabbits: 3, 2, 3.7, 5, 2.7, and 3 inches. I need to figure out the relative measure of skewness and choose the correct option from A to J.

First, I remember that skewness refers to the asymmetry in a distribution. A normal distribution is symmetrical, so positive or negative skewness means it's leaning to one side or the other. If the skewness is zero, it's perfectly symmetrical.

So, the first step is to order the data to better understand its distribution. Let's arrange the numbers from smallest to largest: 2, 2.7, 3, 3, 3.7, 5.

Looking at the ordered data, I can see the smallest value is 2, then 2.7, followed by three 3s, then 3.7, and the largest is 5. Hmm, that looks a bit spread out but not too much.

Next, I think about the mean and median because skewness is often discussed in relation to these. The median is the middle value. Since there are six numbers, the median will be the average of the third and fourth numbers. The third is 3 and the fourth is also 3, so the median is 3.

Now, let's calculate the mean. Adding all the values: 2 + 2.7 is 4.7, plus 3 is 7.7, plus another 3 is 10.7, plus 3.7 is 14.4, and finally plus 5 is 19.4. So the total is 19.4, and dividing by 6 gives the mean. 19.4 divided by 6 is approximately 3.23 inches.

Wait, so the mean is about 3.23 and the median is 3. That means the mean is slightly higher than the median. In a positively skewed distribution, the mean is greater than the median because the tail is on the right side. So that suggests positive skewness.

But wait, let me double-check. Positive skewness occurs when the right tail (higher end) is longer. So if the mean is higher than the median, the data is pulled towards the higher end, making the right tail longer. That would mean positive skewness.

Looking back at the data, the highest value is 5, which is quite a bit larger than the others. So that might be pulling the mean up. The rest of the data points are clustered around 2 to 3.7. So yes, that would cause the distribution to be positively skewed.

Now, let's consider the options. Option A says the distribution is positively skewed, which fits. Option B is zero skewness, which would mean it's symmetrical, but I don't think so because the mean and median aren't the same. Option C is negatively skewed, which would mean the left tail is longer, but here the mean is higher, so that's not it. Option D says perfectly normal, but with only six data points, it's unlikely to perfectly match a normal distribution. Option E is uniform, which would mean all values are equally likely, but the data isn't spread out that way. Option F is bimodal, meaning two peaks, but I don't see that here. The data seems to have one peak around 3 inches. Option G is multimodal, which would be more than two peaks; again, not the case here. Option H says skewness can't be determined, but I think we can since we have the data. Option I says no skewness, which implies symmetry, but that's not the case. Option J says symmetrical, but again, the mean and median are different, so it's not symmetrical.

So based on that, the correct answer should be A: The distribution is positively skewed.

The data points are 2, 2.7, 3, 3, 3.7, and 5 inches. Ordering them shows the smallest value is 2 and the largest is 5. The median is 3, and the mean is approximately 3.23. Since the mean is greater than the median, the distribution is positively skewed.

Answer: A
