Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about job training and younger workers. Hmm, I need to figure out which option is correct. Let me read the question again: "With respect to job training, younger workers..." The options are A through J, each making a different claim.

First, I should think about what I know regarding how younger workers approach job training. I remember reading somewhere that younger people might have different attitudes or learning styles compared to older workers. Maybe they're more tech-savvy, but does that mean they need more or less training?

Option A says younger workers have less experience and need more training. That makes some sense because they're new, but maybe they adapt quickly. I'm not sure if that's the best answer.

Option B claims they don't benefit as much as older workers. I'm not sure about that. I think training effectiveness can vary, but I don't know if younger workers inherently benefit less.

Option C says they're less open to feedback. I'm not certain, but I think younger workers might be more open to feedback since they're still developing their skills. So maybe C is incorrect.

Option D suggests they prefer classes by themselves. I don't know about that. Some might, but I don't think it's a general rule.

Option E says they always learn faster. "Always" seems too strong. People learn at different paces, so I don't think E is correct.

Option F claims they always perform worse than trained older workers. Again, "always" is too absolute. It's possible in some cases, but not always.

Option G says they receive more opportunities. I'm not sure about that. It might depend on the company, but I don't have enough info to confirm G.

Option H states they're not interested in job training. I think many younger workers are interested in growing their skills, so H might not be right.

Option I says they perform better than trained older workers. That could be true in some contexts, but it's not necessarily always the case. It depends on the situation.

Option J suggests they prefer online training over traditional classrooms. That sounds plausible because younger generations are more accustomed to digital learning. I think online training is more common for them.

Wait, but the question is about job training in general. So, considering that, which option is correct? Let me think again. Younger workers might be more tech-savvy, so they might prefer online learning. That would make J a good option. Also, I recall that online training is often self-paced and flexible, which suits many younger workers.

Another angle: the effectiveness of training. Do younger workers need more or less? I think they might adapt quickly, so maybe they don't need as much as older workers who might be learning new technologies for the first time. But the options don't directly address that. So, looking back, J seems the most likely correct because it's about their preference in training methods.

The correct answer is J. Younger workers often prefer online training over traditional classroom learning due to its flexibility and alignment with their tech-savvy nature.

Answer: J
