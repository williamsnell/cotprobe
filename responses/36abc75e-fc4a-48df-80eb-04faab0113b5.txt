Okay, so I've got this question about effusion rates of two gases, HBr and CH4. Hmm, I remember from chemistry class that effusion has to do with the rate at which gases escape through a tiny opening. The question gives me their molecular weights: HBr is 81 and CH4 is 16. The effusion rate for HBr is 4 ml/sec, and I need to find the rate for CH4.

Wait, I think this involves Graham's Law of Effusion. Right, Graham's Law states that the rate of effusion is inversely proportional to the square root of the molecular weight. So the formula should be Rate1 / Rate2 = sqrt(Molecular Weight2 / Molecular Weight1). 

Let me write that down: Rate1/Rate2 = sqrt(M2/M1). Here, Rate1 is HBr's rate, which is 4 ml/sec, and M1 is 81. Rate2 is what I'm looking for, and M2 is 16 for CH4.

Plugging in the numbers: 4 / Rate2 = sqrt(16/81). Let's compute sqrt(16/81). The square root of 16 is 4, and the square root of 81 is 9. So sqrt(16/81) is 4/9.

So now the equation is 4 / Rate2 = 4/9. To solve for Rate2, I can cross-multiply: 4 * 9 = 4 * Rate2. That gives 36 = 4 * Rate2. Dividing both sides by 4, Rate2 = 9. Wait, that can't be right because if HBr is heavier, CH4 should effuse faster. Wait, no, wait. Let me double-check my setup.

Wait, no, maybe I messed up the ratio. Graham's Law says Rate1/Rate2 = sqrt(M2/M1). So Rate2 = Rate1 * sqrt(M1/M2). Oh wait, perhaps I should rearrange the equation correctly.

Alternatively, since Rate is inversely proportional to sqrt(M), then Rate ∝ 1/sqrt(M). So Rate2 = Rate1 * sqrt(M1/M2). Let me plug that in.

Rate2 = 4 ml/sec * sqrt(81/16). The square root of 81 is 9, and sqrt(16) is 4. So 9/4. So 4 * (9/4) = 9 ml/sec. Oh, so CH4 would effuse at 9 ml/sec. Wait, but wait, CH4 is lighter, so it should effuse faster. So if HBr is 4, and CH4 is lighter, its rate should be higher. Wait, 9 is higher than 4, so that makes sense.

Wait, but looking at the options, J is 9 ml/sec. So that would be the answer. But wait, let me make sure I didn't mix up the ratio. Another approach: the rate ratio is sqrt(M2/M1). So for the same opening, the lighter gas should effuse faster. So Rate_CH4 / Rate_HBr = sqrt(M_HBr / M_CH4) = sqrt(81/16) = 9/4 = 2.25. So Rate_CH4 = Rate_HBr * 2.25 = 4 * 2.25 = 9 ml/sec. Yep, that's correct.

So the answer should be J: 9 ml/sec.

The effusion rate is determined using Graham's Law, which relates the rates inversely to the square roots of the molecular weights. For CH₄, the rate is calculated as 9 ml/sec.
