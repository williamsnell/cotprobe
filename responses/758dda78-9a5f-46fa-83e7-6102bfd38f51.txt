Okay, so I've got this question about autocorrelation coefficients and statistical significance. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through. 

The problem gives me three autocorrelation coefficients at lags 1, 2, and 3. The values are 0.2, -0.15, and -0.1 respectively. They also mention that these are estimates obtained using 250 data points, and we're to assume the coefficients are approximately normally distributed. The question is asking which of these coefficients are statistically significant at the 5% level.

Wait, I remember that for autocorrelation, the significance test is usually done using the standard normal distribution or sometimes the t-distribution. Since they say the coefficients are approximately normally distributed, maybe we can use the z-test here. But wait, another thought: I think the standard test for autocorrelation coefficients (like in the Durbin-Watson test) uses a different critical value, but perhaps for large sample sizes, the normal approximation is okay.

But wait, another approach is to calculate the standard error (SE) of the autocorrelation coefficient. Oh right! For a sample size n, the standard error of the lag k autocorrelation is approximately 1/sqrt(n), assuming that the autocorrelation is under the null hypothesis of no autocorrelation. So for n=250, the SE would be 1/sqrt(250). Let me compute that: sqrt(250) is about 15.81, so 1/15.81 is approximately 0.063.

So the critical value at the 5% level would be ±1.96 times the standard error. Let me compute that: 1.96 * 0.063 ≈ 0.123. So any coefficient with an absolute value greater than 0.123 would be considered statistically significant at the 5% level.

Now, looking at the coefficients:

- Lag 1: 0.2. The absolute value is 0.2, which is greater than 0.123. So this is significant.
- Lag 2: -0.15. Absolute value is 0.15 which is greater than 0.123. So this is significant.
- Lag 3: -0.1. Absolute value is 0.1, which is less than 0.123. So this is not significant.

Wait, but wait a second. I think the formula for the standard error is actually 1/sqrt(n - k - 1) or something like that, depending on the model. Oh, but since the question says to assume the coefficients are approximately normally distributed, maybe we don't need to worry about that correction. It's possible they're simplifying it to 1/sqrt(n), so n=250, SE=0.063.

So according to that, Lag 1 is significant, Lag 2 is significant, and Lag 3 isn't. But wait, looking at the options, option I says 1 and 2 only, which would be significant. But wait, let me double-check the calculation.

Wait, 1/sqrt(250) is approximately 0.063. 1.96 * 0.063 is about 0.123. So any coefficient with |r| > 0.123 is significant. So:

- 0.2 > 0.123 → significant.
- 0.15 > 0.123 → significant.
- 0.1 < 0.123 → not significant.

So that would mean lags 1 and 2 are significant, and lag 3 is not. So looking at the options, option I is "1 and 2 only". But wait, looking back at the options, option I is "1 and 2 only", which would be correct if both were significant.

Wait, but another thought: I'm using the standard error as 1/sqrt(n), but maybe the formula is different. Oh right, I think the standard error for the sample autocorrelation is actually 1/sqrt(n - k), where k is the lag. So for lag 1, SE would be 1/sqrt(250 -1)=1/sqrt(249)=approx 0.0632. For lag 2, SE is 1/sqrt(250-2)=sqrt(248)=~15.748, so SE≈0.0635. Similarly for lag 3, SE=1/sqrt(247)=~0.0636.

Wait, but that's only a minor difference. So the critical value remains around 0.123. So the conclusion remains the same: lags 1 and 2 are significant, lag 3 isn't.

Wait, but another point: in some cases, the critical values for autocorrelation might be different. Like, for example, the Durbin-Watson test has its own critical values, but I think that's for regression residuals, not for the autocorrelation function in general.

Alternatively, perhaps using the normal distribution approach is correct here because the question states that the coefficients are approximately normally distributed. So perhaps each coefficient can be treated as a z-score, where the test statistic is r / SE. So for each lag, compute r / (1/sqrt(n)) and see if it's beyond ±1.96.

So for Lag 1: 0.2 / 0.063 ≈ 3.17, which is greater than 1.96 → significant.

Lag 2: -0.15 / 0.063 ≈ -2.38, which is greater than 1.96 in absolute value → significant.

Lag 3: -0.1 / 0.063 ≈ -1.587, which is less than 1.96 → not significant.

So based on this, lags 1 and 2 are significant, lag 3 isn't. So the answer would be option I: 1 and 2 only.

But wait, looking at the options again:

A: 1, 2 and 3 only

B: All

C: None

D: 1 and 3 only

E: 1 only

F: 3 only

G: Can't determine without SE

H: 2 only

I: 1 and 2 only

J: 2 and 3 only

So according to my calculation, I is correct. But wait, I'm a bit confused because sometimes the standard error for autocorrelation might be different. Wait, another formula I recall is that the variance of the sample autocorrelation at lag k is approximately 2/(n) for large n. So the standard deviation would be sqrt(2/n). Wait, that would make SE = sqrt(2/250)=sqrt(0.008)=approx 0.0894. Then the critical value would be 1.96 * 0.0894 ≈ 0.176.

So then the absolute values:

0.2 > 0.176 → significant.

-0.15: 0.15 < 0.176 → not significant.

-0.1: 0.1 < 0.176 → not significant.

Wait, that's conflicting with the earlier approach. So which is correct?

Hmm, I think I might have made a mistake earlier. Let me clarify: the variance of the sample autocorrelation at lag k (for large n) is 2/n. So standard error is sqrt(2/n). So for n=250, SE= sqrt(2/250)=sqrt(0.008)=approx 0.0894.

So the critical value is 1.96 * 0.0894 ≈ 0.176. So any |r| > 0.176 is significant.

So checking the coefficients:

- Lag 1: 0.2 > 0.176 → significant.

- Lag 2: 0.15 < 0.176 → not significant.

- Lag 3: 0.1 < 0.176 → not significant.

Wait, so that contradicts my earlier conclusion. Now, according to this, only Lag 1 is significant. So the answer would be option E: 1 only.

But wait, this is confusing. Which formula is correct? Let me think again. The sample autocorrelation function (ACF) at lag k, say r_k, has an approximate variance of (2)/(n) when n is large, assuming the true autocorrelation is zero. So Var(r_k) = 2/n → SE = sqrt(2/n).

Alternatively, another source says that the variance is 1/n for the first lag, but I'm not sure. Wait, I think I need to get this right.

Upon checking, the standard error of the sample autocorrelation at lag k is approximately 1/sqrt(n) for small lags, but for the general case, it's sqrt( (2)/(n) ) for larger lags, but I might be mixing things up.

Wait another thought: perhaps the standard error for the ACF is 1/sqrt(n) for each lag, regardless of k. Because each r_k is computed as (correlation), and for large n, the variance of r_k is approximately 1/n. So standard error is 1/sqrt(n).

Wait, that makes sense because for a sample correlation, the standard error is usually 1/sqrt(n-2) or something like that, but for large n, it's roughly 1/sqrt(n). So if that's the case, then the standard error is 1/sqrt(250)= ~0.063.

Then, the critical value is 1.96 * 0.063 ≈ 0.123. So any |r| > 0.123 is significant.

So in that case:

- Lag 1: 0.2 > 0.123 → significant.

- Lag 2: 0.15 > 0.123 → significant.

- Lag 3: 0.1 < 0.123 → not significant.

Which brings us back to the initial conclusion that lags 1 and 2 are significant, so option I.

But wait, I'm getting conflicting results based on different approaches. Which one is correct?

Alternatively, perhaps the correct standard error is sqrt( (2)/(n) ), which would be 0.0894, leading to a critical value of ~0.176. Then, only Lag 1 is significant.

I think I need to figure out which formula is correct for the standard error of the autocorrelation coefficient.

Upon checking, the variance of the sample autocorrelation at lag k is given by (2)/(n) for large n, assuming no true autocorrelation. So the standard error is sqrt(2/n). So for n=250, SE= sqrt(2/250)=sqrt(0.008)=0.0894.

So using this, the critical value is 1.96 * 0.0894 ≈ 0.176. So:

- Lag 1: 0.2 > 0.176 → significant.

- Lag 2: 0.15 < 0.176 → not significant.

- Lag 3: 0.1 < 0.176 → not significant.

So only Lag 1 is significant. Therefore, the answer would be option E: 1 only.

Wait, but I'm getting conflicting information. Another source says that for the ACF, the standard error is 1/sqrt(n) for each lag. So which is correct?

Alternatively, perhaps the standard error is 1/sqrt(n - k), but for large n, the difference is negligible. Wait, but for k=1, n=250, n -k =249, so 1/sqrt(249)=~0.0632, which is close to 1/sqrt(250)=0.063.

So perhaps the initial approach was correct, and the standard error is 1/sqrt(n), leading to only Lag 1 and 2 being significant.

But now I'm really confused because different sources might present it differently. Let me try to find a definitive answer.

Upon checking, the standard error of the sample autocorrelation at lag k is approximately 1/sqrt(n) for each lag, especially when n is large. So the variance is 1/n, and the SE is 1/sqrt(n).

Therefore, using SE=1/sqrt(250)=0.063, the critical value is 1.96*0.063≈0.123.

So:

- Lag 1: 0.2 >0.123 → significant.

- Lag 2: 0.15>0.123 → significant.

- Lag 3: 0.1 <0.123 → not significant.

Thus, lags 1 and 2 are significant, which is option I.

But wait, another source I found says that the variance for the ACF at lag k is 2/n, so SE=sqrt(2/n). So which is it?

Hmm, perhaps it depends on whether the data is from a stationary process and other assumptions. But the question says to assume the coefficients are approximately normally distributed, so perhaps we can proceed with the SE=1/sqrt(n) approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for the variance of the ACF at lag k is Var(r_k) = (1 + 2 sum_{i=1}^{k-1} r_i^2 ) / n. But for large n and if the true autocorrelations are small, this approximates to 1/n.

Wait, that makes sense. So if the true autocorrelations are zero, then Var(r_k)=1/n, so SE=1/sqrt(n). But if there are other autocorrelations, it might be different.

Given that the question states that the coefficients are approximately normally distributed, perhaps we can safely use SE=1/sqrt(n)=0.063.

Therefore, critical value=0.123. So lags 1 and 2 are significant.

Wait, but I'm still not entirely sure. Some sources I've seen use the standard error as 1/sqrt(n) for the ACF, while others use sqrt(2/n). But I think for the purposes of this question, the intended approach is to use SE=1/sqrt(n), leading to lags 1 and 2 being significant.

Wait, but let me think again. If the standard error is 1/sqrt(n), then:

- 0.2 / 0.063 ≈ 3.17 → significant.

- 0.15 / 0.063 ≈ 2.38 → also significant.

- 0.1 / 0.063 ≈ 1.587 → not significant.

So the answer would be I: 1 and 2 only.

But looking back at the options, option I is "1 and 2 only", which would be correct.

Wait, but I'm getting conflicting conclusions based on different SE formulas. Maybe the question expects us to use the 1/sqrt(n) approach, so the answer is I.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is trying to test knowledge that for multiple lags, the standard errors are adjusted, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the approximate 95% confidence interval for each coefficient. The 95% CI would be ±1.96*(1/sqrt(n)).

So for each coefficient:

- 0.2: 0.2 ± 0.123 → (0.077, 0.323). Since it doesn't include zero, it's significant.

- -0.15: -0.15 ± 0.123 → (-0.273, 0.023). Oh wait, this interval includes zero, so it's not significant.

Wait, no, that can't be right because -0.15 is less than 0.123 in absolute terms. Wait, 0.15 is greater than 0.123, so it's outside the CI.

Wait, no, the confidence interval is around the coefficient. So for -0.15, the CI is from -0.15 -0.123 to -0.15 +0.123, which is (-0.273, -0.027). Since zero is not in this interval, it's significant.

Wait, that's correct because 0.15 > 0.123. So the coefficient is significant.

Similarly, 0.2 is way above 0.123, so it's significant.

Lag 3 is 0.1, which is less than 0.123, so not significant.

So the conclusion is that lags 1 and 2 are significant. So the answer is I.

But wait, earlier when I used SE=sqrt(2/n)=0.0894, the critical value was 0.176, and 0.15<0.176, so not significant. But that approach might not be correct here.

I think the correct approach is to use SE=1/sqrt(n), so the answer is I: 1 and 2 only.
</think>

The question involves determining which autocorrelation coefficients at lags 1, 2, and 3 are statistically significant at the 5% level, given 250 data points and coefficients of 0.2, -0.15, and -0.1. To assess significance, the standard error (SE) of the autocorrelation coefficients is approximated as \( \frac{1}{\sqrt{n}} \), where \( n = 250 \). This yields \( \text{SE} \approx 0.063 \). The critical value for a 5% significance level is \( 1.96 \times 0.063 \approx 0.123 \). 

- **Lag 1**: Coefficient = 0.2. The absolute value \( |0.2| > 0.123 \), so it is significant.
- **Lag 2**: Coefficient = -0.15. The absolute value \( |-0.15| > 0.123 \), so it is significant.
- **Lag 3**: Coefficient = -0.1. The absolute value \( |-0.1| < 0.123 \), so it is not significant.

Thus, only lags 1 and 2 are statistically significant at the 5% level.
