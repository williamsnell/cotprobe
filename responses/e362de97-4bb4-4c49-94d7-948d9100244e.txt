Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem. Let me read it again and understand what's being asked. 

We have a 10 kg box sliding horizontally without friction at a speed of 1 m/s. Then, at some point, a constant force is applied in the direction of its motion. The box travels 5 meters with this force applied. After the force is removed, the box's speed increases to 2 m/s. We need to find the magnitude of the applied force. 

Hmm, the options are A through J, with various values. So I need to figure out which force F makes sense here.

First, let's think about what happens here. The box is moving initially at 1 m/s, and after some force is applied for a distance of 5 meters, it ends up moving at 2 m/s. So the force does some work on the box, increasing its kinetic energy.

Since there's no friction, the only work done on the box is by this applied force. So the work done should equal the change in kinetic energy.

Wait, let's break this down. The kinetic energy of the box is given by (1/2)mv². The initial kinetic energy is (1/2)*10*(1)^2 = 5 J. The final kinetic energy after the force is removed is (1/2)*10*(2)^2 = 20 J. So the change in kinetic energy is 20 - 5 = 15 J. 

So the work done by the force F over the distance d (which is 5 m) should be equal to this change in KE. Work is F*d, but since the force and displacement are in the same direction, the work is positive. 

So, Work = F * d = 15 J.

Wait, but wait a second. The force is applied over 5 meters, so F * 5 = 15 J. Solving for F, F = 15 /5 = 3 N. Hmm, that would be option J. 

But wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me double-check. The box starts at 1 m/s, and after the force is applied for 5 m, it's moving at 2 m/s. So the work done by the force increases the KE from 5 J to 20 J, a difference of 15 J. So F * 5 = 15, so F=3 N. That's option J. 

Wait, but another approach: Maybe using kinematics equations. Let's see. The box starts at 1 m/s, ends at 2 m/s after moving 5 m under the force. 

We can use the work-energy theorem again, which I think is the same as what I did. Alternatively, using acceleration. Since F is applied, the acceleration a would be F/m. The initial velocity u is 1 m/s, final velocity v is 2 m/s, displacement s is 5 m. Using the equation v² = u² + 2as. 

Plugging in: 2² = 1² + 2*a*5. So 4 = 1 + 10a → 3 =10a → a=0.3 m/s². 

Then F = m*a = 10 *0.3=3 N. So again, F=3 N, which is J. 

So that's consistent. So why am I confused? Maybe because I thought the answer might be different, but both methods give F=3 N. 

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Let me check the work-energy again. The initial KE is 5 J, final is 20 J. So the change is 15 J. The work done is F*5, so F=3 N. Yep, that's correct. 

Wait, but perhaps I should consider the fact that the force is applied for a certain time and not just distance? But no, because the work done is F*d, regardless of time, as long as the force is applied over that distance. 

Alternatively, maybe the box's velocity increases due to the force, and it's moving 5 m under that force. But I think the work-energy approach is correct here. 

So, the answer should be J:3 N.

The problem involves a 10 kg box sliding without friction, initially at 1 m/s. A constant force is applied in the direction of motion, causing the box to travel 5 m and reach a final speed of 2 m/s. To find the magnitude of the applied force, we use the work-energy theorem, which states that the work done by the force equals the change in kinetic energy.

The initial kinetic energy of the box is:

\[
KE_{\text{initial}} = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 = \frac{1}{2}(10)(1)^2 = 5 \, \text{J}
\]

The final kinetic energy is:

\[
KE_{\text{final}} = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 = \frac{1}{2}(10)(2)^2 = 20 \, \text{J}
\]

The change in kinetic energy is:

\[
\Delta KE = KE_{\text{final}} - KE_{\text{initial}} = 20 - 5 = 15 \, \text{J}
\]

The work done by the force over the distance of 5 m is:

\[
W = F \cdot d = 15 \, \text{J}
\]

Solving for the force:

\[
F = \frac{W}{d} = \frac{15}{5} = 3 \, \text{N}
\]

Thus, the magnitude of the applied force is **3 N**, corresponding to option J.

Answer: J
