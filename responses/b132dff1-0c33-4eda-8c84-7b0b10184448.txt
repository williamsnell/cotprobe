Okay, so I've got this problem here about a water tank and flow rates. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

The question says the water tank will hold 50 gallons. I need to find the flow rate required to fill it in 20 seconds. Hmm, flow rate is usually volume over time, right? So I think the formula I need is flow rate equals total volume divided by time. 

So, the volume is 50 gallons, and the time is 20 seconds. That means I should divide 50 by 20 to get the flow rate in gallons per second. Let me do that calculation. 50 divided by 20 equals... 2.5. Wait, that seems right because 20 times 2.5 is 50. 

Now, looking at the options, I need to find which one matches 2.5. Let's see the options again: A is 6, B is 70, C is 1.5, D is 5, E is 16.7, F is 10, G is 0.4, H is 4, I is 3.5, and J is 2.5. Oh, there's J as 2.5. So that should be the correct answer. 

Wait, did I do that right? Let me double-check. If the flow rate is 2.5 gallons per second, then in 20 seconds, it would be 2.5 * 20 = 50 gallons. Yep, that matches the tank's capacity. So I'm pretty confident the answer is J.

The flow rate required is calculated by dividing the tank's volume by the time. 50 gallons divided by 20 seconds equals 2.5 gallons per second. 

Answer: J
