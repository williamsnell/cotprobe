Okay, so I have this question about the TV show 'Cheers' and I need to figure out what character Woody replaced. The options are from A to J, and I have to pick the correct one. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that 'Cheers' is a classic sitcom that ran for many years. The main bar is Cheers in Boston, and there are several regular characters. Woody is one of the characters, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details of who he replaced.

I think about the main characters. There's Sam, the owner of Cheers. Then there's Diane, who was one of the waitresses. I remember that Woody is another waiter, but I'm not sure exactly who he replaced. Wait, wasn't there a character before Woody who was also a waiter? I think so.

Let me go through the options. Option F is Sam, but Sam is the owner, so he wouldn't be replaced by a waiter. Option I is Rebecca, but she's another character, maybe a regular but not a waiter. Option C is Carla, who was a waitress, but I don't think she was replaced by Woody. Option E is Vera, but I don't recall her being a main character. Option D is Lilith, which is one of the barflies, right? So she's a regular but not a waiter.

Option H is Coach, but he was more of a regular with his own set of friends. Option G is Frasier, but Frasier is from 'Frasier,' which is a spin-off, and he was a character on 'Cheers' too, but I don't think he was a waiter. Wait, Frasier was actually the manager at Cheers, wasn't he? Hmm, maybe, but I'm not sure if he replaced someone.

Option B is Cliff, but Cliff was a regular at the bar, not a waiter. Option A is Norm, another regular, but he's a regular customer, not a waiter. Option J is Diane, who was a waitress, but I don't think she was replaced by Woody.

Wait, I think the character Woody replaced was a waiter named Vera. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe it was someone else. Let me think again. Oh, I think Vera was a character who was a waitress before Woody. So when Vera left, Woody took her place as the main male waiter.

Alternatively, I might be mixing up some details. Maybe it's not Vera. I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to recall the cast. The main waitresses were Diane, Carla, and Vera. So if Vera left, Woody came in as the new waiter. So I think the answer is E: Vera.
