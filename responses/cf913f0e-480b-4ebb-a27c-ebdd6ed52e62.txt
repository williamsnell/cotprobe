Question:

High levels of progesterone are essential for the maintenance of the uterine lining during pregnancy. But high levels of progesterone exerts a negative feedback action on LH secretion, with a consequent decrease in LH secretion and eventual atrophy of the corpus luteum. Atrophy of the corpus luteum cuts the progesterone supply resulting in menstruation. Clearly, these events cannot take place after conception, or the embryo would get sloughed off. When conception occurs, the corpus luteum is seen to last through most of pregnancy. How can this be explained?

Options:

A: The endometrium produces a hormone that supports the corpus luteum throughout pregnancy.
B: The body naturally adjusts progesterone levels during pregnancy.
C: The placenta secretes a hormone, chorionic gonadotrophin, which takes the place of LH in preserving the corpus luteum. This allows the corpus luteum to secrete high levels of progesterone without being shut off.
D: The corpus luteum spontaneously increases in size during pregnancy, which maintains progesterone levels without hormonal regulation.
E: The corpus luteum is replaced by a secondary organ that secretes progesterone during pregnancy.
F: The corpus luteum is not necessary during pregnancy.
G: The embryo produces progesterone independently, eliminating the need for the corpus luteum after conception.
H: The corpus luteum's lifespan is extended due to increased blood flow to the ovaries during pregnancy.
I: The mother's pituitary gland secretes additional LH during pregnancy to maintain the corpus luteum.
J: The embryo secretes a hormone to preserve the corpus luteum.

Okay, I'm trying to figure out this question about progesterone and the corpus luteum during pregnancy. Let me start by recalling what I know.

So, from what I remember, progesterone is crucial for maintaining the uterine lining during pregnancy. Without enough progesterone, the lining might not stay intact, which could lead to the embryo being expelled, like during a miscarriage. But the question says that high progesterone has a negative feedback effect on LH secretion. LH, I think, is the hormone that helps the corpus luteum function. So normally, high progesterone would reduce LH, causing the corpus luteum to stop working, leading to a drop in progesterone and eventually menstruation.

But after conception, the corpus luteum continues to function longer, providing the necessary progesterone. The question is asking why this is possible.

Looking at the options, let's go through them one by one.

Option A says the endometrium produces a hormone to support the corpus luteum. I'm not sure about that; I thought the endometrium is the lining, but maybe it doesn't produce such a hormone. Not certain yet.

Option B suggests the body adjusts progesterone levels naturally. That's too vague. The question is about why the corpus luteum doesn't atrophy, so B doesn't explain the mechanism.

Option C talks about the placenta producing chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) which replaces LH. I think hCG is important here. From what I remember, after implantation, the placenta starts making hCG, which helps maintain the corpus luteum. So when LH levels drop due to negative feedback from progesterone, hCG takes over, allowing the corpus luteum to keep producing progesterone without being shut down. That makes sense because if the corpus luteum continues, progesterone levels stay high, supporting the pregnancy.

Option D says the corpus luteum grows bigger, so it doesn't need regulation. I don't think that's right because even if it's bigger, without hormonal support, it would still stop functioning.

Option E suggests another organ replaces the corpus luteum. I thought the corpus luteum is still active, but maybe the placenta takes over? Wait, no, the placenta secretes hCG, but the corpus luteum is still needed for progesterone initially. So E might not be correct.

Option F claims the corpus luteum isn't needed during pregnancy. That can't be right because it's the source of progesterone early on.

Option G says the embryo makes its own progesterone. I'm not sure if embryos produce hormones early on. They might, but I think it's more about the corpus luteum and then the placenta taking over.

Option H mentions increased blood flow extending the corpus luteum's life. I don't recall blood flow being the main reason. It's more about hormonal support.

Option I says the pituitary secretes more LH. But if high progesterone inhibits LH, the pituitary wouldn't keep making more. So I don't think this is correct.

Option J says the embryo makes a hormone to preserve the corpus luteum. Wait, that's similar to option C but maybe not exactly. I think the embryo, through the placenta, produces hCG, which supports the corpus luteum. So J could be correct too, but I'm not sure if it's the same as C.

Wait, option C says the placenta secretes hCG to take the place of LH. Option J says the embryo secretes a hormone. Since hCG is produced by the embryo (through the placenta), both C and J might be similar. But the way they're phrased is a bit different. Option C is about hCG taking over LH's role, which is more accurate because hCG acts similarly to LH in supporting the corpus luteum.

So the correct answer should be C. It explains that after conception, the placenta (which is part of the embryo's development) produces hCG, which maintains the corpus luteum, allowing it to keep producing progesterone without the negative feedback shutting it down.

The correct answer is C. After conception, the placenta secretes chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG), which replaces LH in maintaining the corpus luteum. This allows the corpus luteum to continue producing high levels of progesterone without being affected by negative feedback, ensuring the uterine lining remains intact to support the pregnancy.
