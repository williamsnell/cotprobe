Okay, so I have this physics problem here about two masses connected by a spring on a frictionless track. I need to find the frequency of their oscillatory motion. Hmm, I remember that when masses are connected by a spring, it's a type of harmonic oscillator problem. But wait, what's the formula for the frequency in such a system?

I think the formula involves the reduced mass of the system. Yeah, right. The formula for the angular frequency ω is the square root of (k over μ), where μ is the reduced mass. And the frequency f is ω divided by 2π. So first, I need to calculate μ.

The two masses are m₁ = 100 grams and m₂ = 200 grams. Oh wait, I should convert grams to kilograms because SI units are needed here. So m₁ is 0.1 kg and m₂ is 0.2 kg. The reduced mass μ is (m₁ * m₂) divided by (m₁ + m₂). Let me calculate that.

So μ = (0.1 kg * 0.2 kg) / (0.1 + 0.2) = (0.02) / (0.3) = 0.0666... kg, approximately 0.0667 kg.

The spring constant k is given as 0.5 N/m. Now, plugging into the formula: ω = sqrt(k/μ) = sqrt(0.5 / 0.0667). Let me compute that.

0.5 divided by 0.0667 is approximately 7.5. So sqrt(7.5) is about 2.7386 radians per second. Wait, but the options are given in frequency, not angular frequency. So I need to find f = ω / (2π).

Calculating that: 2.7386 / (2 * π) ≈ 2.7386 / 6.283 ≈ 0.436 Hz. Wait a second, that doesn't match any of the options. Did I make a mistake?

Let me double-check. Oh wait, maybe I missed a step. Wait, no, the formula is correct. Alternatively, perhaps I confused the formula for the system's frequency. Wait, I think I might have miscalculated the reduced mass or the steps after.

Wait, let me recalculate μ. m₁ = 0.1 kg, m₂ = 0.2 kg. So μ = (0.1 * 0.2) / (0.1 + 0.2) = 0.02 / 0.3 = 0.066666... kg.

Then k/μ is 0.5 / 0.066666... Let me calculate that again: 0.5 divided by 0.066666... is 7.5. So sqrt(7.5) is approximately 2.7386 rad/s. Then f = 2.7386 / (2π) ≈ 0.436 Hz. Hmm, but the options don't have this. Did I make a mistake in the formula? Wait another thought: maybe the formula uses the total mass instead of reduced mass? No, no, for two masses connected by a spring, it's definitely the reduced mass in the denominator.

Wait, perhaps I inverted the formula. Let me think again. The formula for the angular frequency is ω = sqrt(k / μ). So that part seems right. Then f = ω/(2π). So 2.7386 / 6.283 ≈ 0.436 Hz. But none of the options match this. Let me check the options again.

Options: A is 0.79 rad/s, which is about 0.125 Hz. Hmm, not matching. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me try another approach.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the angular frequency first in rad/s, then see which option is closest. So ω is sqrt(7.5) ≈ 2.7386 rad/s. Wait, looking at the options, option H is 2.74 rad/s. So that's the angular frequency. But the question asks for the frequency, which is f = ω/(2π) ≈ 0.436 Hz. But the options don't have 0.436. Wait, maybe the question is asking for angular frequency, not the frequency? Let me check the question again.

The question says, "Find the frequency of oscillatory motion for this system." So it's asking for f in Hz, but the options are given in rad/s. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, the options are labeled as rad·s⁻¹, which is angular frequency. Oh wait, did I misread the question? It says frequency, but the options are in angular frequency terms. Hmm, that's confusing. Wait, no, the options are in rad/s, which is angular frequency. So the question is actually asking for angular frequency, not frequency in Hz. Oh! So I think I made a mistake earlier because I thought the question was asking for Hz, but it's asking for ω, not f.

Wait, the problem says "frequency of oscillatory motion," but the options are in radians per second. So perhaps the question is actually referring to angular frequency. Maybe it's a typo, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding. So let's clarify: frequency is f (Hz), angular frequency is ω (rad/s). The problem says "frequency," but the options are in rad/s. Hmm, that's conflicting.

Wait, perhaps the problem is written correctly, and the options are in rad/s. So perhaps the question is actually asking for the angular frequency, and the wording is incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps I should proceed as if the question is correct, but the options are in angular frequency. Let me think again.

Wait, I think the formula for frequency is f = (1/(2π)) * sqrt(k/μ). So if I compute that, it's approximately 0.436 Hz. But the options don't have that. So perhaps I'm missing something else in the setup.

Wait, another approach: perhaps it's a two-body problem where each mass oscillates around the center of mass. But the angular frequency for each mass's motion would be the same, given by sqrt(k/μ). So in that case, the angular frequency ω is sqrt(k/μ) ≈ 2.738 rad/s, which is option H. But the question says "frequency," so is the answer 0.436 Hz, which isn't an option, or is it 2.74 rad/s (option H)?

Wait, perhaps I should re-examine the problem statement. It says "frequency of oscillatory motion." In physics, sometimes the term "frequency" might be used when they actually mean angular frequency, especially in contexts where the answer is expected in rad/s. Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the term correctly, but the options are in rad/s, which would imply that the correct answer is the angular frequency.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating μ. Let me recalculate μ again. μ = (m1 * m2) / (m1 + m2) = (0.1 kg * 0.2 kg) / (0.3 kg) = 0.02 kg² / 0.3 kg = 0.066666... kg. So that's correct.

Then, k/μ = 0.5 / 0.066666... = 7.5. So sqrt(7.5) = approx 2.7386 rad/s. So the angular frequency is about 2.74 rad/s, which is option H.

Wait, but the problem asks for the frequency, which would be in Hz, so maybe the answer is 0.436 Hz, but that's not an option. So perhaps the problem is actually asking for the angular frequency, and the options are correct as is. So the answer would be option H: 2.74 rad/s.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Let me think again: when two masses are connected by a spring, the system's angular frequency is indeed sqrt(k/μ), where μ is the reduced mass. So that part is correct.

So I think the correct answer is option H: 2.74 rad/s.

The problem involves two masses connected by a spring on a frictionless track, and the goal is to find the frequency of their oscillatory motion. The formula for the angular frequency (ω) of such a system is given by:

\[
\omega = \sqrt{\frac{k}{\mu}}
\]

where \( k \) is the spring constant and \( \mu \) is the reduced mass of the system. The reduced mass is calculated as:

\[
\mu = \frac{m_1 \cdot m_2}{m_1 + m_2}
\]

Given \( m_1 = 0.1 \, \mathrm{kg} \) and \( m_2 = 0.2 \, \mathrm{kg} \), the reduced mass is:

\[
\mu = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.2}{0.1 + 0.2} = \frac{0.02}{0.3} = 0.0667 \, \mathrm{kg}
\]

The spring constant \( k = 0.5 \, \mathrm{N/m} \). Substituting into the formula for \( \omega \):

\[
\omega = \sqrt{\frac{0.5}{0.0667}} = \sqrt{7.5} \approx 2.7386 \, \mathrm{rad/s}
\]

The problem asks for the frequency of oscillatory motion, but the options are given in angular frequency (rad/s). Therefore, the angular frequency \( \omega \) is approximately \( 2.74 \, \mathrm{rad/s} \), which corresponds to option H.
