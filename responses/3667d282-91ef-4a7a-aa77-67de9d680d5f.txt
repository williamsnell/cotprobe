Question:

What is one reason why the government discourages collusion between large firms in the same industry?

Options:

A: Joint profit maximization leads to a decrease in consumer surplus as the price falls below competitive levels.
B: Collusive output levels tend to increase, driving the price down to competitive levels.
C: Collusion between large firms leads to an increase in consumer surplus.
D: Collusive output levels tend to increase, driving the price above competitive levels.
E: Joint profit maximization costs society consumer surplus as the price rises above competitive levels.
F: Collusive output levels tend to decrease, driving the price down to competitive levels.
G: Collusion between large firms leads to an oversupply in the market.
H: Consumer surplus falls as the price is driven downward.
I: Joint profit maximization leads to a decrease in market competition.
J: Collusion between large firms leads to a decrease in consumer demand.

Okay, so I have to figure out why the government discourages collusion between large firms in the same industry. Hmm, I remember from my economics class that collusion is when firms in the same industry agree to set prices or output levels together. I think this is usually bad for competition and consumers. 

Let me look at the options. Option A says joint profit maximization leads to a decrease in consumer surplus because the price falls below competitive levels. Wait, that doesn't sound right. If prices fall below competitive levels, that would mean lower prices for consumers, increasing their surplus. But I thought collusion actually leads to higher prices because firms are acting like a monopoly. So maybe A is incorrect.

Option B says collusive output increases, driving prices down to competitive levels. That seems off too because if they collude, they might reduce output to increase prices, not increase. So B might not be right.

Option C suggests collusion increases consumer surplus, which I don't think is the case. Collusion usually hurts consumers, so C is probably wrong.

Option D says collusive output decreases, driving prices above competitive levels. That makes sense because if firms agree to produce less, the price goes up. So D seems like a good candidate. Higher prices mean lower consumer surplus, which is why the government would disapprove.

Option E mentions joint profit maximization costs society by rising prices. That also sounds correct because higher prices reduce consumer surplus. So E could be another option, but I need to see which one is more accurate.

Option F says output increases and prices go down, which doesn't align with what I know about collusion. So F is probably wrong.

Option G talks about oversupply, which doesn't seem related. Collusion is more about controlling prices and output to maximize profits, not creating more supply. So G is likely incorrect.

Option H says consumer surplus falls because prices go down. Wait, if prices go down, surplus increases, so H is wrong. Unless I'm misunderstanding, but I think in collusion, prices go up, so H is incorrect.

Option I says joint profit reduces market competition. That's true because collusion reduces competition, leading to less choice and higher prices. So I is another possible answer.

Option J says collusion decreases consumer demand. I don't think that's right. Collusion affects supply and prices, not demand directly.

So the question is why the government discourages collusion. The main reasons are higher prices, reduced competition, and lower consumer surplus. Looking at the options, both D and E and I are relevant. Wait, but the question asks for one reason. 

Option D is about prices rising due to lower output, leading to higher prices. Option E says joint profit maximization costs society by rising prices. So both E and D are about higher prices, but D explains the mechanism (output decrease) while E is the result.

The question is about why the government discourages it, so the reason is likely because it leads to higher prices, which reduces consumer surplus. So E is about the cost to society due to higher prices, which reduces consumer surplus. Alternatively, D explains how output levels affect prices.

Wait, the options are a bit tricky. Let me think again. If firms collude, they agree to set prices above competitive levels to maximize profits. This reduces output and increases prices. So the result is higher prices, lower output, and lower consumer surplus. So the correct reason would be that collusion drives prices above competitive levels, reducing consumer surplus.

Looking back at the options, option D says collusive output levels tend to increase, driving the price above competitive levels. Wait, no, if output increases, prices should fall, right? Because more supply would lower prices. So D is incorrect. Option E says joint profit maximization costs society as prices rise above competitive levels. That makes sense because when firms collude, they act like a monopoly, setting higher prices than in a competitive market, thus reducing consumer surplus.

Alternatively, option I says collusion decreases market competition, which is another valid reason. But the question is about a reason related to prices or output.

So I think the best options are E and D, but I might have confused the effects earlier. Let me clarify: collusion leads to less output (reducing supply) which causes prices to rise. So the output levels decrease, not increase. So option D says output levels increase, which is wrong. So D is incorrect.

Option E correctly states that joint profit maximization causes prices to rise above competitive levels, reducing consumer surplus. Therefore, the government discourages collusion because it leads to higher prices and lower consumer surplus.

Wait, but option I is also correct in that collusion reduces competition, which is another reason. So the answer could be either E or I, but the question is about one reason, so perhaps the immediate effect is on prices.

Alternatively, the main reason is higher prices, which directly affects consumer surplus. So E is the correct answer. Alternatively, option I is about competition, which is another valid reason.

Wait, the question is why the government discourages collusion. One major reason is that it leads to higher prices and lower consumer surplus. So E states that consumer surplus is lost because prices rise.

Yes, so E is correct.

The government discourages collusion because it leads to higher prices, which reduce consumer surplus. Collusion allows firms to act like a monopoly, maximizing profits by setting prices above competitive levels. This results in lower output and higher prices, directly harming consumers. 

Answer: E
