Okay, so I need to figure out which NBA team Phil Jackson played for before he became a coach. Let me think about what I know regarding Phil Jackson. He's a well-known figure in the NBA, both as a player and as a coach. As a coach, he was famous for leading the Chicago Bulls and the Los Angeles Lakers to multiple championships. But the question is about his playing days before he took up coaching.

I remember that Phil Jackson played basketball, but I'm not exactly sure which team he was on. He's more famous for his coaching career, especially with the Bulls and Lakers. Wait, I think he played for the New York Knicks. But I'm not 100% certain. Alternatively, I might be confusing him with someone else.

Let me recall some details. The New York Knicks have had several notable players, but I'm trying to remember if Jackson was one of them. Or maybe it's the Chicago Bulls? No, I think he played before he was with the Bulls as a coach. Wait, no, the Bulls were his team as a coach, but when he was a player, he might have been on a different team.

I think he played for the New York Knicks. I recall that he was part of the Knicks team that made it to the NBA Finals in the late 1970s. Specifically, I think it was in 1973 or 1974. But I'm not entirely sure, so I should double-check. Alternatively, he might have played for the Chicago Bulls, but I think that was more as a coach than as a player.

Wait, another thought: the Boston Celtics are one of the all-time great teams, but I don't think Jackson played for them. The Philadelphia 76ers, maybe? Or perhaps the Golden State Warriors? Hmm, I'm not sure about those.

I'm leaning towards the New York Knicks because I remember a bit about him being part of a Knicks team that was competitive in the 70s. Let me think about some of his teammates. Was he with the Knicks when they had their great run? I think so. So putting that together, the answer is probably A: New York Knicks.
