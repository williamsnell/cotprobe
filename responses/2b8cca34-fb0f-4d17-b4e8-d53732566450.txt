Alright, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about a utilitarian's view on rights. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the question is asking what a utilitarian who recognizes rights would say about how rights are explained based on utility. Utilitarianism is a theory that suggests the best action is the one that maximizes overall happiness or utility. So, when it comes to rights, a utilitarian would probably argue that rights are justified if they contribute to the greatest good for the greatest number.

Looking at the options, I need to find which one aligns with this idea. Let's go through each option one by one.

Option A says there are only moral rights and no utility. That doesn't seem right because utilitarianism is all about utility. So A is probably incorrect.

Option B is "all of the above," which I can put on hold until I check the others.

Option C claims there are no moral rights, only utility. But the question states that the utilitarian recognizes rights, so C might be too extreme. They do acknowledge rights, so C is likely not the answer.

Now, options D to J describe what justifies a moral right. Let's parse them:

D: Justified by the fact that its recognition will diminish overall welfare. That seems counter to utilitarianism, which aims to maximize welfare, so D is probably wrong.

E: Recognition won't contribute to maximizing overall welfare. Again, that goes against the utilitarian goal, so E is likely incorrect.

F: Recognition will not diminish welfare. Hmm, this is saying that rights don't make things worse, but not necessarily that they improve things. Not sure yet.

G: Recognition leads to maximizing individual welfare. Wait, utilitarianism is about overall, not individual, so G might not be the right fit.

H: Recognition leads to minimizing overall welfare. That's the opposite of what utilitarians want, so H is out.

I: Recognition has no impact on welfare. Doesn't seem right because utilitarians would care about the impact on welfare.

J: Recognition contributes to maximizing overall welfare. This sounds exactly like what a utilitarian would say. Rights are justified if they help maximize overall happiness or utility.

So, reviewing the options, J seems to be the correct answer. It directly ties the recognition of rights to the maximization of overall welfare, which is the core of utilitarianism.

The correct answer is J: a moral right is a kind of claim that is justified by the fact that its recognition will contribute to the maximization of overall welfare.

Answer: J
