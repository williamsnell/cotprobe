Okay, so I need to figure out the correct answer to this equity theory question. Let me start by recalling what I know about equity theory. I remember that equity theory, developed by Adams, focuses on how individuals perceive fairness in their work based on the inputs they give and the outcomes they receive compared to others.

The question is asking when equity and inequity are perceived. The options are A through J, but looking at the provided options, it's A to H. Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: Equity is perceived when a person has high expectations for promotion. Hmm, that doesn't sound right. Equity is about the balance between what you put in and what you get out, not just expecting promotions. So maybe A isn't correct.

Option B: Equity is perceived when there's a balance between a person's inputs and outcomes on the job. This sounds familiar. Equity theory is all about the balance between inputs (like effort, skills) and outcomes (like salary, recognition). So B seems correct.

Option C: Inequity is perceived when a person receives the same outcomes as others, regardless of input. Wait, if outcomes are the same but inputs differ, that would feel inequitable. For example, if I work hard but someone else who doesn't work as hard gets the same bonus. So C might be correct, but let me think more.

Option D: Equity is perceived when a person's salary is higher than their peers. No, equity isn't about being higher; it's about fairness. If your salary is higher because your inputs are higher, that's equity. But if it's just higher without more input, it might not be. So D is about a situation that could be equitable, but the statement is about perceived equity, not the actual condition.

Option E: Inequity is perceived when a person's inputs are recognized through awards and honors. Wait, if inputs are recognized, that's positive. So getting awards would probably be seen as equity, not inequity. So E is incorrect.

Option F: Inequity is perceived when a person compares their job title with others. Comparing titles alone might lead to inequity if the inputs and outcomes don't match. But the statement is about inequity when comparing titles regardless of other factors, so F might be a correct scenario for inequity.

Option G: Equity is perceived when there's an imbalance between a person's inputs and outcomes. That's the opposite of equity. Equity is when the balance is there, so G is wrong.

Option H: Equity is perceived when a person is promoted. Promotion can be a result of equity if the inputs justify it. But promotion alone doesn't define equity. So H is not correct.

Now, I need to choose between the options. The question is when equity and inequity are perceived. So the correct definition of equity is when inputs and outcomes are balanced, which is option B. 

Looking at inequity, option C says inequity when outcomes are same regardless of input. That would be a case of inequity because the person might feel underpaid if they put in more. Similarly, option F talks about comparing job titles, which could lead to inequity if the inputs don't match the title. So which one is correct?

Wait, the question is about when equity and inequity are perceived. The options are each about one scenario. So each option is a separate case.

So, the correct answer for equity is B. For inequity, looking at the options, C and F are about inequity. But the question is about when inequity is perceived. So which scenario correctly shows inequity.

Inequity occurs when there's an imbalance. So option C: same outcomes regardless of input. That's an imbalance. So C is correct for inequity. But looking at the options, each option is about either equity or inequity.

Wait, the question is to select all that apply? No, the question is "When are equity and inequity perceived?" So it's about when each is perceived. The options are each a separate statement.

So, the correct answer for equity is B. For inequity, the correct scenario is when a person's inputs don't match others' outcomes. So looking at the options, option C is about inequity when outcomes are same regardless of input. That's correct.

Wait, but the options are separate. So the correct answer would be B for equity and C for inequity. But the question is presented as a multiple-choice, so perhaps each option is a standalone statement. Let me check the options again.

The question is: "When are equity and inequity perceived?" So each option is a statement about when equity or inequity is perceived. So each option is either about equity or inequity.

So, the correct answer is B for equity and C for inequity. But looking at the options, the user is asking for which option is correct. Wait, no, the user provided options A to H, each a statement. So the question is to pick the correct statement about when equity or inequity is perceived.

So, for example, option B correctly states when equity is perceived. Option C correctly states when inequity is perceived. But the question is, "When are equity and inequity perceived?" So perhaps the question is looking for both, but in the options, each is a separate statement.

Wait, no, the question is a single sentence, and the options are each a statement. So the question is asking, which of the following is correct regarding when equity and inequity are perceived. So each option is a possible correct statement.

So, among the options, B correctly defines equity. C correctly defines inequity. But the options are separate; perhaps the question is looking for the correct definition of equity. So the answer would be B.

Wait, but the question is phrased as "When are equity and inequity perceived?" So it's about both. But each option is a separate statement about either equity or inequity. So perhaps the correct answers are B and C, but the options are given as A to H, each a separate option. So the user is to select which is correct.

Wait, perhaps the way the question is phrased, it's a multiple-choice question where the correct answer is one option. So looking back, the question is "Discuss equity theory. When are equity and inequity perceived?" So the correct answer is the option that correctly states when equity is perceived, and another for inequity. But the options are separate.

Wait, perhaps the question is to select the correct statement about equity, and another about inequity, but in the options, each is a separate statement. So the user is to choose the correct option, which might cover both.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. Equity theory says that equity is when the ratio of inputs to outcomes is similar to others. So when a person's inputs and outcomes are balanced, that's equity. So option B is correct.

Inequity is when the ratio is not balanced. So, for example, if a person feels they're putting in more than they're getting compared to others. So option C says inequity is when outcomes are same regardless of input. That would be a case of inequity because if someone's inputs are higher but outcomes are same, they feel inequity.

But the options are A to H, each a separate statement. So the correct answer would be B for equity and C for inequity. But the question is presented as a single choice. Wait, no, the question is "When are equity and inequity perceived?" So perhaps it's a single correct option that correctly identifies both, but looking at the options, each is a separate statement.

Wait, perhaps the question is to select which statement correctly identifies when equity is perceived. So the correct answer is B. Alternatively, if the question is about when inequity is perceived, the correct answer would be C.

Wait, the question is to discuss equity theory and when equity and inequity are perceived. So perhaps the correct answer is B, which correctly defines equity, and another option for inequity.

But the options are separate, so perhaps the correct answer is B for equity and C for inequity, but the question is to choose the correct option. Alternatively, perhaps the question is to choose the correct statement about equity, which is B, and another correct statement about inequity, which is C. But the options are separate, so perhaps the user is to pick the correct option.

Given that, the correct answer for equity is B, and for inequity is C. But the options are separate, so I need to see which is the correct option.

The user is asking to select from A to H. So the correct answer is B and C. But in the options provided, each is a separate statement. So perhaps the correct answer is B and C, but the options are separate. However, the way the question is phrased, it's a single choice.

Wait, perhaps the question is to identify which statement is correct about equity or inequity. So both B and C are correct, but the options are separate. So perhaps the user is to select both, but the options are presented as single choices.

Wait, no, the way the question is given, it's a multiple-choice with options A to H, each a statement. So the correct answer would be the statement that correctly defines equity or inequity.

So, the correct statement about equity is B: Equity is perceived when there's a balance between inputs and outcomes.

The correct statement about inequity is C: Inequity is perceived when a person receives the same outcomes as others, regardless of input.

But the question is asking about when both are perceived, so perhaps the correct answer is both B and C. But in the options, each is a separate choice.

Wait, perhaps the question is to select all that apply, but the user hasn't specified. So, given that, the correct options are B and C.

But looking back, the user provided options A to H, each a statement. So the correct answer is that both B and C are correct. But since the options are separate, perhaps the user is to choose the correct one.

Wait, but the question is to choose the correct statement. So if the question is to identify when equity is perceived, the answer is B. If it's about inequity, the answer is C.

But the question is phrased as "When are equity and inequity perceived?" So perhaps the correct answer is both B and C. However, in a multiple-choice setting, each option is a separate statement, so perhaps the question is to select all correct options, but the user hasn't specified that.

Alternatively, perhaps only one option is correct. Let me re-examine the options.

Option B: Equity when inputs and outcomes are balanced. Correct.

Option C: Inequity when outcomes same regardless of input. Correct.

So both B and C are correct. But the options are separate. So perhaps the question expects both to be correct, but the user is to select all that apply. However, the way the question is given, it's a single-choice question.

Wait, perhaps the question is to select the correct statement about equity, which is B, and another about inequity, which is C. But the options are separate, so perhaps the user is to select both, but in this case, the answer would be both B and C.

But the way the user presented the question, it's a single-choice, so perhaps the correct answer is B and C. But in the given options, each is a separate option. So perhaps the user is to select both.

But since the user is asking to select from A to H, each a separate option, and the last character must be the letter chosen, perhaps the correct answer is B for equity and C for inequity, but the options are separate, so the user is to choose both. However, in the given setup, the user is to reply with a single letter.

Wait, perhaps the question is to select the correct definition of equity, which is B. So the answer is B.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is to select the correct statement about when inequity is perceived, which is C.

But the question is about both equity and inequity. So perhaps the correct answer is both B and C. But the user is to choose from the options, each a separate statement. So perhaps the correct answers are B and C, but the user is to choose all that apply.

However, given that the user is to respond with a single letter, perhaps the intended answer is B.

Wait, let me think again. The question is to discuss equity theory and when equity and inequity are perceived. So the correct answer is that equity is perceived when inputs and outcomes are balanced (B), and inequity is perceived when they are not (which could be when outcomes are same regardless of input, as in C).

So both B and C are correct. But the options are separate, so perhaps the user is to select both. But in the given setup, the user is to choose one option. So perhaps the intended answer is B for equity.

But the question is about both equity and inequity. So perhaps the correct answer is both B and C. But the options are separate, so perhaps the user is to select both. But the way the question is phrased, it's a single-choice, so perhaps the correct answer is B.

Wait, perhaps the question is to select the correct statement about equity, which is B. So the answer is B.

Equity theory, developed by Adams, suggests that individuals perceive fairness based on the balance between their inputs (e.g., effort, skills) and outcomes (e.g., salary, recognition) compared to others. When this balance exists, equity is perceived. Conversely, inequity arises when this balance is disrupted.

- **Option A**: Incorrect. Equity is not about high promotion expectations but about the balance between inputs and outcomes.
- **Option B**: Correct. Equity is perceived when there's a balance between a person's inputs and outcomes on the job.
- **Option C**: Correct. Inequity is perceived when a person receives the same outcomes as others, regardless of their inputs, leading to a sense of imbalance.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. Equity is not about having a higher salary; it's about fairness relative to others' inputs and outcomes.
- **Option E**: Incorrect. Recognition through awards is typically seen as equitable, not inequitable.
- **Option F**: Incorrect. Comparing job titles alone doesn't define inequity; it's the mismatch between inputs and outcomes that matters.
- **Option G**: Incorrect. Equity requires balance, not imbalance.
- **Option H**: Incorrect. Promotion is a result of equity but doesn't define it.

The correct answer for equity is **B**, and for inequity is **C**. However, since the question asks for a single choice, the most accurate answer regarding equity is **B**.

Answer: B
