Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields from a charged disk. Let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to remember the concepts.

The question says: At what distance along the central perpendicular axis of a uniformly charged plastic disk is the magnitude of the electric field equal to one-half the magnitude of the field at the center of the surface of the disk? 

Hmm. So, first, I need to recall the formula for the electric field produced by a uniformly charged disk at a point along its central axis. I remember that for an infinite sheet of charge, the field is σ/(2ε₀), but a disk is finite, so the field should vary with distance from the center.

Wait, the disk has radius 0.600 m. The problem mentions the central perpendicular axis, so we're looking at points along the axis perpendicular to the disk's plane, passing through its center.

At the center of the disk (z=0), the electric field should be the strongest because all the charges contribute in the same direction. As you move along the axis away from the center, the field decreases. I think the formula for the electric field at a distance z from the center is given by E = (σ/(2ε₀)) * (1 - (z/√(z² + R²))), where R is the radius of the disk, and σ is the surface charge density.

Wait, let me make sure. I think the formula is E = (σ/(2ε₀)) * (1 - (z/√(z² + R²)) ). So at the center (z=0), the second term becomes zero, so E_center = σ/(2ε₀). 

The problem asks for the distance z where E = (1/2) E_center. So E(z) = (1/2) * (σ/(2ε₀)) )= σ/(4 ε₀). 

So setting up the equation:

σ/(4 ε₀) = (σ/(2 ε₀)) [1 - (z/√(z² + R²)) ]

Let me simplify this. I can cancel σ/(2 ε₀) from both sides by dividing both sides by that term. So:

(1/2) = 1 - (z/√(z² + R²))

Let me rearrange that:

z/√(z² + R²) = 1 - 1/2 = 1/2.

So z/√(z² + R²) = 1/2.

Let me square both sides to eliminate the square root. That gives:

z² / (z² + R²) = 1/4.

Multiply both sides by (z² + R²):

z² = (1/4)(z² + R²)

Multiply out the right side:

z² = (z²)/4 + R²/4.

Bring all terms to one side:

z² - (z²)/4 = R²/4.

Simplify the left side:

(4z² - z²)/4 = R²/4 → (3z²)/4 = R²/4.

Multiply both sides by 4:

3z² = R².

So z² = (R²)/3 → z = R / sqrt(3).

Wait, R is 0.600 m, so z = 0.600 / sqrt(3).

Calculate that: sqrt(3) is approximately 1.732, so 0.600 / 1.732 ≈ 0.346 m.

Looking at the options, option G is 0.346 m. So that should be the answer.

Wait, let me double-check the steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So starting from E(z) = (1/2) E_center. Then E_center is σ/(2 ε₀), so E(z) is σ/(4 ε₀). Plugging into the formula, I got that z/√(z² + R²) = 1/2. Squaring both sides correctly gives me z²/(z² + R²) = 1/4. Then solving for z gives z = R/sqrt(3), which is approximately 0.346 m. That seems right.

The electric field along the central perpendicular axis of a uniformly charged disk at a distance \( z \) from the center is given by:

\[
E(z) = \frac{\sigma}{2\epsilon_0} \left( 1 - \frac{z}{\sqrt{z^2 + R^2}} \right)
\]

At the center of the disk (\( z = 0 \)), the electric field is \( E_{\text{center}} = \frac{\sigma}{2\epsilon_0} \). The problem asks for the distance \( z \) where \( E(z) = \frac{1}{2} E_{\text{center}} \). Substituting \( E(z) = \frac{\sigma}{4\epsilon_0} \) into the equation:

\[
\frac{\sigma}{4\epsilon_0} = \frac{\sigma}{2\epsilon_0} \left( 1 - \frac{z}{\sqrt{z^2 + R^2}} \right)
\]

Dividing both sides by \( \frac{\sigma}{2\epsilon_0} \):

\[
\frac{1}{2} = 1 - \frac{z}{\sqrt{z^2 + R^2}}
\]

Rearranging:

\[
\frac{z}{\sqrt{z^2 + R^2}} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

Squaring both sides:

\[
\frac{z^2}{z^2 + R^2} = \frac{1}{4}
\]

Multiplying through by \( z^2 + R^2 \):

\[
z^2 = \frac{1}{4}(z^2 + R^2)
\]

Simplifying:

\[
3z^2 = R^2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad z = \frac{R}{\sqrt{3}}
\]

Given \( R = 0.600 \, \text{m} \), we find:

\[
z = \frac{0.600}{\sqrt{3}} \approx 0.346 \, \text{m}
\]

Thus, the correct answer is:

G: \( 0.346 \, \text{m} \)
