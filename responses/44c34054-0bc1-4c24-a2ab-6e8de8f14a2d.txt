Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. Let me try to break it down. It's about mirrors and image formation, which I remember from my optics lessons. The question has two parts, (a) and (b), and I need to choose the correct option from A to J.

Starting with part (a): What type of mirror is required to form an image on a wall 3 meters from the mirror of the filament of a headlight lamp that's 10 cm in front of the mirror. Hmm. So, the object is 10 cm in front, and the image is formed on a wall 3 meters away. Wait, 3 meters is 300 cm. So the image is much farther away than the object. 

I think I need to recall the mirror formulas. The mirror equation is 1/f = 1/do + 1/di, where f is the focal length, do is the object distance, and di is the image distance. But wait, the sign conventions matter here. Typically, in mirrors, the object distance is positive if it's in front of the mirror, and the image distance is positive if it's real and on the opposite side. 

Wait, the image is formed on a wall, which means it's a real image. So the image is real, so it's on the opposite side of the mirror from the object. So di would be positive. But the object is 10 cm in front, so do is 10 cm. The image is 300 cm behind the mirror, so di is 300 cm. Plugging these into the equation: 1/f = 1/10 + 1/300. Let me calculate that.

1/10 is 0.1, and 1/300 is approximately 0.003333. Adding them: 0.103333. So 1/f ≈ 0.103333, meaning f ≈ 1/0.103333 ≈ 9.677 cm. Wait, that's positive. So f is positive. In mirrors, a positive focal length means it's a concave mirror. Because for concave mirrors, the focal point is in front, so the focal length is positive. Convex mirrors have a negative focal length because their focus is behind the mirror.

So part (a) requires a concave mirror because the image is real and formed on the wall. So looking at the options, the first part of the answer must be concave, so options A, C, D, I, J are the ones with concave or convex. Wait, I think I misread: the options have two parts, the first being the mirror type, the second the image height.

Wait, the options are A: Concave, 5 mm; B: Convex, 5 mm; etc. So for part (a), the mirror type is concave. So options A, C, D, I, J are possible, but wait, concave is only in A, C, D, I, J? Let me see: A, C, D are concave. I and J are convex. So for part (a), the answer is concave, so options A, C, D are possible. 

But wait, let me think again. The question is about forming an image on the wall, which is a real image. So concave mirrors can form real images when the object is within the focal length (do < f), between f and 2f, or beyond 2f. Wait, in this case, do is 10 cm and f is about 9.68 cm. So do is slightly larger than f. So the object is just beyond the focal point. Wait, no, wait, wait. Wait, do is 10 cm, f is about 9.68 cm. So do is just beyond f. Hmm, but wait, in concave mirrors, when the object is between the mirror and the focal point (do < f), the image is virtual and behind the mirror. But when the object is beyond f, the image is real and in front. So in this case, do is 10 cm, f is about 9.68 cm, so do is just beyond f. So the image is real, which is what we want because it's projected on the wall.

So that makes sense. So part (a) requires a concave mirror. So the first part of the option is concave. So looking at the options, the first letters A, C, D are concave.

Now part (b): What is the height of the image if the object's height is 5 mm. So we need to find the magnification. Magnification m is given by m = hi/ho = -di/do. Since di is 300 cm and do is 10 cm, m = -300/10 = -30. The negative sign indicates that the image is inverted. But since the question is about the height, the magnification's absolute value will determine the size. So the height of the image is |m| * ho = 30 * 5 mm = 150 mm. Wait, that's 150 mm. So the image is 150 mm tall. 

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the magnification. di is 300 cm, do is 10 cm. So di/do = 30. So m is -30, meaning inverted. So the image height is 30 times the object height. 5 mm *30=150 mm. So 150 mm. 

Now looking at the options, which option has concave mirror and image height 150 mm. Let's look:

Option C: Concave, 150 mm. So that's the one. So the answer should be option C.

To determine the type of mirror and the height of the image, we analyze the given scenario using the mirror equation and magnification formula.

### Part (a): Type of Mirror
The object is 10 cm in front of the mirror, and the image is formed 300 cm (3 m) behind the mirror. Since the image is real and formed on the wall, the mirror must produce a real image. For mirrors, a positive focal length indicates a **concave mirror**, while a negative focal length indicates a **convex mirror**. Using the mirror equation:

\[
\frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{d_o} + \frac{1}{d_i}
\]

where \(d_o = 10 \, \text{cm}\) and \(d_i = 300 \, \text{cm}\), we calculate:

\[
\frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{10} + \frac{1}{300} \approx 0.1033 \implies f \approx 9.677 \, \text{cm}.
\]

Since \(f\) is positive, the mirror must be **concave**.

### Part (b): Height of the Image
The magnification \(m\) is given by:

\[
m = \frac{h_i}{h_o} = -\frac{d_i}{d_o}.
\]

Substituting \(d_i = 300 \, \text{cm}\) and \(d_o = 10 \, \text{cm}\):

\[
m = -\frac{300}{10} = -30.
\]

The negative sign indicates the image is inverted, but the height depends on the absolute value of \(m\). Given the object height \(h_o = 5 \, \text{mm}\), the image height is:

\[
h_i = |m| \cdot h_o = 30 \cdot 5 \, \text{mm} = 150 \, \text{mm}.
\]

### Final Answer
The required mirror is **concave**, and the image height is **150 mm**. 

**Answer: C**
