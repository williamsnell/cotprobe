Okay, so I've got this problem here about the interference of light using two slits. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my optics, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

Alright, the setup is that two narrow slits are illuminated with red light, wavelength 694.3 nm. The screen is 3 meters away, and the distance between the bright bands is 1.50 cm. I need to find the distance between the slits. The options are given in millimeters, so I'll have to make sure I convert units correctly.

Wait, I remember that this is a double-slit interference problem. The formula that relates these things is the one for the spacing between bright fringes on the screen. The formula I think is delta y equals lambda times D divided by d, where delta y is the distance between the bright bands, lambda is the wavelength, D is the distance from the slits to the screen, and d is the distance between the slits. So, delta y = (lambda * D) / d.

Let me write that down: delta y = (lambda * D) / d. I need to find d, so I can rearrange this formula. Rearranging, d = (lambda * D) / delta y.

Wait, but I need to make sure all the units are consistent. The wavelength is given in nanometers, D is in meters, and delta y is in centimeters. Let me convert them all to meters for consistency.

So, lambda is 694.3 nm. Since 1 nm is 1e-9 meters, that's 694.3e-9 meters. D is 3.00 meters. Delta y is 1.50 cm, which is 0.015 meters.

Plugging the numbers into the rearranged formula: d = (694.3e-9 m * 3.00 m) / 0.015 m.

Let me compute that. First, multiply 694.3e-9 by 3.00. 694.3e-9 is approximately 6.943e-7 meters. Multiply by 3, that gives 2.0829e-6 m².

Now, divide that by 0.015 m. So, 2.0829e-6 / 0.015. Let me calculate that. 2.0829e-6 divided by 0.015 is the same as 2.0829e-6 * (1/0.015) = 2.0829e-6 * 66.666... which is approximately 1.3886e-4 meters.

Wait, 1.3886e-4 meters is equal to 0.13886e-3 meters, which is 0.13886 mm. Or, converting meters to millimeters: 1.3886e-4 m = 0.13886 mm. Wait, because 1 mm is 1e-3 meters, so 1.3886e-4 m is 0.13886 mm.

Looking at the options, I see option J is 0.139 mm, which matches this calculation. So the answer should be J.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Sometimes when dealing with exponents, it's easy to slip up.

So, 694.3 nm is 694.3e-9 meters. Correct. D is 3.00 m. Delta y is 1.50 cm = 0.015 m. Correct.

So, (694.3e-9 * 3.00) = 2082.9e-9 m². Which is 2.0829e-6 m². Divided by 0.015 m, which is 0.015 m. So 2.0829e-6 / 0.015 = 1.3886e-4 m, which is 0.13886 mm. So 0.139 mm. Yup, that's option J.

I think that's right. Let me just make sure I didn't mix up delta y and d anywhere. Wait, no, the formula is correct. Delta y is the distance between fringes, so yes, using that in the denominator. And everything else seems correct.

To solve the problem, we use the formula for the distance between bright fringes in a double-slit interference pattern:  
\[
\Delta y = \frac{\lambda D}{d}
\]  
where:  
- \( \Delta y \) is the distance between the bright bands,  
- \( \lambda \) is the wavelength of the light,  
- \( D \) is the distance from the slits to the screen,  
- \( d \) is the distance between the slits.  

Rearranging the formula to solve for \( d \):  
\[
d = \frac{\lambda D}{\Delta y}
\]  

### Step 1: Convert units to consistency  
- \( \lambda = 694.3 \, \text{nm} = 694.3 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m} \)  
- \( D = 3.00 \, \text{m} \)  
- \( \Delta y = 1.50 \, \text{cm} = 0.015 \, \text{m} \)  

### Step 2: Plug values into the formula  
\[
d = \frac{(694.3 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m}) \times 3.00 \, \text{m}}{0.015 \, \text{m}}
\]  

### Step 3: Simplify  
\[
d = \frac{2.0829 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}^2}{0.015 \, \text{m}} = 1.3886 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{m} = 0.13886 \, \text{mm}
\]  

### Step 4: Match with options  
The closest option is **0.139 mm**, which corresponds to **J**.
