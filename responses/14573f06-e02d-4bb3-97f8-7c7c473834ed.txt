Okay, so I need to divide 7,285 by 4. Hmm, let's see. I remember that division is about splitting a number into equal parts. So, 4 goes into 7,285 how many times? 

Let me start by breaking it down digit by digit. 4 goes into 7 once because 4 times 2 is 8, which is too big. So I write down 1. Then, subtract 4 from 7, which leaves 3. Bring down the next digit, which is 2, making it 32.

Now, how many times does 4 go into 32? Well, 4 times 8 is 32 exactly, so I write down 8. Subtract 32 from 32, and there's no remainder. Bring down the next digit, which is 8. Wait, 4 goes into 8 exactly 2 times. So I write 2. Subtract 8 and get 0. Then bring down the last digit, 5.

Wait, I think I might have made a mistake here. Because after bringing down the 8, I had 8, and 4 goes into 8 twice, so that's correct. Then bring down the 5. Now, 4 goes into 5 once, because 4 times 1 is 4. Subtract 4 from 5, and I have a remainder of 1.

So putting it all together, I have 1, 8, 2, and then 1, with a remainder of 1. So the quotient is 1,821 with a remainder of 1. Looking at the options, that would be option J: 1,821 R1.

Wait, let me double-check. Maybe I should do it step by step more carefully. 

First, 4 into 7 is 1, remainder 3. Then bring down the 2, making 32. 4 into 32 is 8, remainder 0. Bring down the 8, 4 into 8 is 2, remainder 0. Bring down the 5, 4 into 5 is 1, remainder 1. So yes, 1,821 with a remainder of 1. So the correct answer is J.

The division of 7,285 by 4 results in a quotient of 1,821 with a remainder of 1. Therefore, the correct answer is J.
