Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the number of university graduates at the time of independence for certain countries. The question is a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down.

The question says: "At the time of independence, there were already hundreds of thousands of university graduates in ____, but hardly any at all in ____." And I need to choose between options A to J.

First, I should think about when each country gained independence. India, for example, got independence from Britain in 1947. Congo, which is now the Democratic Republic of the Congo, got its independence from Belgium in 1960. Australia's independence is a bit more complicated because it was a British colony, but it's often considered to have gained full independence in 1948, though it remained part of the British Commonwealth. South Korea, on the other hand, got independence from Japan in 1945, but then was divided into North and South Korea, with South Korea becoming an independent state after the Korean War, which ended in 1953.

Now, the question is about the number of university graduates. I remember that higher education systems vary a lot between countries. India, being one of the largest countries in the world, probably had a significant number of universities even before independence. But wait, during British rule, India did have some universities, like the University of Calcutta and others. So by 1947, when India became independent, they likely had a substantial number of graduates.

Congo, on the other hand, was a Belgian colony until 1960. Belgium, being a smaller country, might have invested less in higher education in the colonies. So when Congo became independent, it's possible that they didn't have many universities or graduates because the education system was likely focused on primary and secondary levels, and higher education was probably limited, especially in the colony.

Looking at the options, the first blank is a country with hundreds of thousands of graduates, and the second is one with hardly any. So the first country should be one with a developed higher education system at the time of independence, and the second should be one with a less developed system.

Option A: India, Congo. That makes sense because India had a more established system, while Congo was just gaining independence and might not have had many graduates.

Option B: India, Australia. Australia's independence is a bit tricky. Australia's higher education system was well-established by the time of independence, so I don't think it was the case that they had hardly any graduates.

Option H: Congo, India. No, because that would mean Congo had many graduates and India had few, which doesn't fit.

So looking at the options, A seems correct. India had many graduates, Congo had few.

The answer is A: India, Congo.

**Answer: A**
