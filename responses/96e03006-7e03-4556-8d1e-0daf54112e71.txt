Options:

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the likelihood ratio test for GARCH models. Hmm, I need to figure out which statements are true. Let me break it down.

The question is about testing whether a GARCH(2,2) model can be restricted to a model with a constant conditional variance. So the null hypothesis is that the variance is constant, meaning the GARCH coefficients might be zero or something like that.

First, let me recall what the likelihood ratio test (LRT) does. The LRT compares two models: the null (restricted) and the alternative (unrestricted). The test statistic is -2 times the difference in the log-likelihoods of the two models. Under the null, this statistic should follow a chi-squared distribution with degrees of freedom equal to the number of parameters estimated in the unrestricted model that aren't in the restricted one.

In a GARCH(2,2) model, the variance equation has parameters like α0, α1, α2, β1, β2. If we restrict it to a constant variance, we're probably setting all the GARCH coefficients (α1, α2, β1, β2) to zero, leaving only α0. So the number of restrictions here is 4. Therefore, the test statistic should have 4 degrees of freedom, not 2. So option A says 2 degrees of freedom, which would be wrong. So A is false.

Option B says the log-likelihood is bigger for the restricted model. Wait, the unrestricted model is more flexible, so it should fit better, meaning its log-likelihood would be higher. Therefore, the restricted model's log-likelihood is lower. So B is incorrect.

Option C gives log-likelihoods of -112.3 (restricted) and -118.4 (unrestricted). Wait, that can't be right because the unrestricted should have a higher (less negative) log-likelihood. Here, the restricted is higher, which doesn't make sense. So the test statistic would be -2*( -112.3 - (-118.4) ) = -2*(6.1)= -12.2. But test statistics are positive, so maybe they took absolute value or I'm misunderstanding. Wait, no, the formula is 2*(LR) = 2*(unrestricted LL - restricted LL). So 2*( -118.4 - (-112.3) )= 2*(-6.1)= -12.2. But the test statistic can't be negative. Did I mess up the formula? Oh wait, the log-likelihoods are both negative, but the difference could be negative if the restricted model is worse. So the test statistic is 2*(unrestricted - restricted) = 2*(-118.4 +112.3)= 2*(-6.1)= -12.2. That can't be right because the test statistic should be positive. Wait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me think again: the unrestricted model is more general, so its log-likelihood should be higher. So if the restricted model has LL = -112.3 and the unrestricted is -118.4, that would mean the unrestricted model is worse, which is impossible. So the numbers in option C must be swapped. Therefore, the value of the test statistic would be 2*( -112.3 - (-118.4) )= 2*(6.1)=12.2. But wait, that would mean the restricted model has a higher LL, which is unlikely. So perhaps the test statistic in C is correct, but the setup is wrong. So option C is incorrect because the log-likelihoods are in the wrong order.

Option D says the LRT compares the slopes of the log-likelihood at max and restricted parameters. Wait, no, the LRT is about the difference in the maximum log-likelihoods, not the slopes. The slopes might relate to the score test, but not the likelihood ratio. So D is incorrect.

So, looking back, the correct statements would only be C if the test statistic is calculated correctly despite the log-likelihoods being swapped. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the options. Let me check again.

Wait, the log-likelihoods in C are -112.3 (restricted) and -118.4 (unrestricted). So the unrestricted model has a lower log-likelihood, which is impossible because the unrestricted model should fit better. So the numbers must be wrong, meaning the test statistic in C is wrong. So option C is incorrect.

Therefore, the only correct statement is... none except perhaps C if the numbers were swapped. But the options given, A is wrong (degrees of freedom should be 4), B is wrong, C is wrong because the LLs are presented incorrectly, and D is wrong. Wait, but none of the options seem correct? That can't be. Maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake about the degrees of freedom. Let me think: in the GARCH(2,2) model, the variance equation has 4 parameters (α1, α2, β1, β2). Restricting to a constant variance would set these 4 parameters to zero. So the number of restrictions is 4, so the test statistic should have 4 df. So A says 2 df, which is wrong. So A is incorrect.

So none of the options seem correct except maybe C if the LLs were presented incorrectly. Wait, maybe I'm supposed to assume that the restricted model has the lower LL. So in option C, the unrestricted is -112.3 and the restricted is -118.4. Then the test statistic would be 2*( -112.3 - (-118.4) )= 2*(6.1)=12.2, which matches option C. So in that case, C is correct. But the way the option is written, the restricted is -112.3 and the unrestricted is -118.4, which is impossible. So perhaps the option is correct because the test statistic is 12.2, regardless of the order. Or maybe the question assumes that the test statistic is calculated correctly regardless of the LLs' order.

Wait, no, the test statistic is based on the correct difference. If the unrestricted model has a lower LL, that would mean the test statistic is negative, which isn't possible. So perhaps there's a typo, but the question says the LLs are -112.3 (restricted) and -118.4 (unrestricted). That can't be, so perhaps the test statistic in C is incorrect. Therefore, the correct answer would be none of the options except perhaps C if we ignore the LL order. But that's confusing.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's see: the correct test statistic for LRT is 2*(LR) = 2*(unrestricted LL - restricted LL). So if the restricted LL is -112.3 and the unrestricted is -118.4, then 2*( -118.4 - (-112.3) )= 2*(-6.1)= -12.2. But test statistics are positive, so maybe we take the absolute value, making it 12.2. So the test statistic is 12.2, which matches option C. So despite the LLs being in the wrong order, the test statistic's magnitude is correct. Therefore, option C is correct.

So the correct answer would be C.

The question involves testing whether a GARCH(2,2) model can be restricted to a constant conditional variance using the likelihood ratio test (LRT). The analysis of each option is as follows:

- **Option A**: The test statistic for the LRT follows a chi-squared distribution with degrees of freedom equal to the number of restrictions. In this case, restricting the GARCH(2,2) model to a constant variance involves setting four parameters (α1, α2, β1, β2) to zero, resulting in 4 degrees of freedom. Therefore, the claim of 2 degrees of freedom is incorrect, making **A false**.

- **Option B**: The unrestricted model is more flexible and should generally fit the data better, leading to a higher (less negative) log-likelihood value compared to the restricted model. The claim that the restricted model has a higher log-likelihood is incorrect, making **B false**.

- **Option C**: The log-likelihood values provided are -112.3 (restricted) and -118.4 (unrestricted). Typically, the unrestricted model should have a higher log-likelihood, but the test statistic is calculated as \( 2 \times (\text{unrestricted LL} - \text{restricted LL}) \). Substituting the values, the test statistic would be \( 2 \times (-118.4 - (-112.3)) = -12.2 \). Since test statistics are positive, the absolute value is taken, resulting in 12.2. Despite the log-likelihoods being presented in an unusual order, the test statistic matches the given value, making **C true**.

- **Option D**: The LRT compares the maximum log-likelihoods of the two models, not the slopes of the log-likelihood function. The slopes are relevant for other tests, such as the score test. Therefore, **D is false**.

The only correct statement is **C**.
