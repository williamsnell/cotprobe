Okay, so I have this question about Durkheim's view on the function of punishment. I'm a bit rusty on my sociology, but I'll try to think it through.

Durkheim was a functionalist, right? He believed that social institutions and practices have functions that contribute to the stability of society. So when it comes to punishment, he probably saw it as serving a specific purpose for society as a whole.

Looking at the options, let's go through them one by one. 

Option A is Vengeance. That sounds more like a retributive idea, which is more about personal revenge rather than a societal function. I don't think Durkheim focused on that.

Option B is Deterrence. Deterrence is about discouraging others from committing crimes by making an example of the punished. That makes sense in a functionalist framework because it's about maintaining order by preventing future crimes.

Option C is Restoration. Restoration usually refers to repairing the harm done, maybe through reparation or reconciliation. I'm not sure if Durkheim emphasized that; it sounds more like a restorative justice approach, which came later.

Option D is Moral Education. That might involve teaching right and wrong, which could be part of it, but I'm not certain if that's the primary function Durkheim emphasized.

Option E is Indemnification. That's about compensating the victim. Again, more of a retributive or restorative aspect, not sure it's Durkheim's main point.

Option F is Rehabilitation. This is about preparing the offender to re-enter society. That's more of a utilitarian or humanitarian approach, not sure it's Durkheim's focus.

Option G is Social Control. This seems broader and more in line with functionalism. Punishment as a way to control deviance and maintain social order. That sounds like Durkheim because he focused on how society maintains cohesion through various mechanisms.

Option H is Incapacitation. This is about preventing the offender from committing more crimes, like through imprisonment. While practical, it's more about individual protection rather than societal function.

Option I is Desert. This is about 'getting what you deserve,' which is more of a retributive justice perspective, not the functionalist view.

So, putting it together, Durkheim likely viewed punishment as a way to maintain social order and control deviance. Among the options, Social Control (G) seems to best capture his perspective. Deterrence (B) is also a possibility because it's about preventing future crimes, but Social Control feels more encompassing as it relates to the broader function of societal mechanisms.

The correct answer is G: Social control. Durkheim viewed punishment as a means to maintain social order and cohesion by controlling deviance, which aligns with the concept of social control.
