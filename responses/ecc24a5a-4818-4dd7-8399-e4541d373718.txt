Question:

During a paternity trial, the mother's attorney asks to have the baby girl, now 36 months old, exhibited for the purpose of calling attention to certain facial resemblances between the child and the reputed father. The defendant's attorney objects to the offering of the baby into evidence for comparison. The trial judge should

Options:

A: permit the child to be exhibited as a non-objectionable form of demonstrative evidence.
B: not permit the child to be exhibited, because such an exhibition would violate the child's rights.
C: not permit the child to be exhibited, because such an exhibition would be self-serving to the complainant.
D: not permit the child to be exhibited, because such an exhibition would be highly prejudicial to the defendant.
E: permit the child to be exhibited as within the hearsay exception of pedigree.
F: not permit the child to be exhibited, as it could emotionally distress the child.
G: permit the child to be exhibited, but only under specific conditions set by the court.
H: permit the child to be exhibited, as it may provide relevant evidence to the jury.
I: not permit the child to be exhibited, as the physical resemblance is not a scientifically reliable form of evidence.
J: permit the child to be exhibited, but only if both parties agree to it.

Okay, so I've got this question about a paternity trial, and I need to figure out what the trial judge should do. Let me try to break this down step by step.

The scenario is that the mother's attorney wants to exhibit the baby girl, who's 36 months old, to point out facial resemblances between the child and the reputed father. The defendant's attorney is objecting to this. I need to determine the correct ruling the judge should make.

First, I remember that in legal cases, especially involving children, there are specific rules and considerations. I think about evidence rules, particularly hearsay, but also about the treatment of children in court.

The question is about whether the child can be brought into the courtroom for the jury to see. The options suggest various reasons why the judge might allow or disallow this.

I recall that in some jurisdictions, children can testify, but there are rules to protect them, like using closed-door proceedings or allowing them to testify via video. But this isn't about testimony; it's about being exhibited as evidence for visual comparison.

I think about the Federal Rules of Evidence, particularly Rule 613, which deals with the use of evidence to prove a witness's credibility by showing they've made inconsistent statements. But that's not directly relevant here.

Rule 803 deals with hearsay exceptions. Option E mentions the pedigree exception, but I'm not sure if physical appearance falls under that. Pedigree usually relates to family history, not physical traits.

Looking at the options, some focus on the child's rights. Option B says it's a violation of the child's rights. I think children do have rights in legal proceedings, but bringing them into court might be allowed if it's for a legitimate purpose. However, there are concerns about their emotional well-being.

Option F suggests it could emotionally distress the child. That's a valid concern. Courts often consider the best interests of the child, especially in custody cases, but here it's a paternity case. Still, exposing a young child to a courtroom setting might not be ideal.

Option D says it's highly prejudicial. Prejudice is a big issue in evidence law. If the child's presence sways the jury emotionally, that could be unfair. Juries might be more inclined to believe the case if they see a resemblance, even if it's not scientifically proven.

Option I argues that physical resemblance isn't scientifically reliable. I know that expert testimony is required for scientific methods, but in this case, the mother's attorney is probably using the child as demonstrative evidence. Demonstrative evidence is allowed to help the jury understand, but it's not the same as substantive evidence.

Option A says it's non-objectionable as demonstrative evidence. I'm not sure if that's the case. Demonstrative evidence is usually things like diagrams or models, not live people. Using a person, especially a child, might be problematic.

Option H suggests it's permitted because it provides relevant evidence. Facial resemblance can be relevant in paternity cases, but relevance doesn't automatically mean it's admissible. The judge must balance relevance against other factors like prejudice.

Option C says it's self-serving. Self-serving evidence is when a party presents evidence that only supports their case without the other side having a chance to respond. But in this scenario, the mother is presenting the child to show resemblance, which could be seen as self-serving, but I'm not sure if that's a valid objection.

Option G allows it under specific conditions. That seems reasonable because judges often set conditions to protect the child, like limiting the time in court or excluding spectators.

Option J requires both parties to agree, which is unusual. Most evidentiary decisions are made by the judge, not dependent on the parties' agreement unless it's a stipulation.

So, putting it all together, the main issues are whether bringing the child into court is appropriate. Courts are cautious about exposing children to the stress of court proceedings. They might allow it if it's necessary for the case, but under strict conditions to protect the child.

I think the correct answer is either A, G, or H. But considering the options, G seems to balance allowing the evidence while protecting the child. The judge could permit it but only under specific conditions, like limiting the time or ensuring it's done respectfully.

Wait, but some states might have specific laws about this. For example, some jurisdictions have age limits or require that the child not be in the courtroom for extended periods. Alternatively, the child might be allowed to be present briefly for identification purposes.

Another angle: under the rules of evidence, live witnesses can be used for identification, but it's not common to bring a child in for that purpose. It's more typical to use photos or have the witness testify based on those.

But the question is about whether the judge should permit the exhibition. The objections are probably about the child's rights and potential prejudice.

I think the best answer is G: permit the child to be exhibited, but only under specific conditions set by the court. This way, the court ensures the child isn't unduly distressed and that the evidence is used appropriately.

The trial judge should permit the child to be exhibited as evidence but only under specific conditions to protect the child's well-being and ensure fairness. This allows the jury to observe the child for facial resemblances while minimizing potential emotional distress and prejudice.
