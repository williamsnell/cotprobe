Question:

This jurisdiction has the following bribery statute in effect:"Any person who offers or gives a thing of value to a government officeholder in exchange for official action is guilty of bribery. "A real estate developer owned a large parcel of land in the suburbs. Although the developer wanted to build an office building on the property, the land was zoned residential. Due to the residential zoning, the developer could not pursue his planned development unless he received a variance from the building commission. The developer held a meeting with a member of the building commission to solicit his approval in securing a zoning variance. To do so, the developer gave the commission member $10,000 in exchange for his support in approving the zoning variance. Thereupon, the commission member voted to approve the variance, thus making it possible for the developer to commence construction of the office building. The developer was subsequently prosecuted for conspiracy to commit bribery. During the course of the trial, the commission member testified that he faked the agreement with the developer and would have approved the zoning variance regardless of whether the developer gave him any money. Furthermore, in his defense, the developer presented evidence that the other six members of the building commission voted affirmatively to approve the variance. If the jury believed that the commission member would have approved the variance even had he not received the $10,000, the developer should be found

Options:

A: guilty, because the commission member's agreement to accept the $10,000 was sufficient to form a conspiratorial objective.
B: guilty, because he gave the commission member the $10,000 in exchange for his approval of the zoning variance.
C: not guilty, because the commission member did not receive a thing of value, since he would have approved the variance regardless of receiving any payment from the developer.
D: not guilty, because there was no true agreement between the parties.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this legal question about bribery and conspiracy. Let me start by breaking down the problem step by step.

First, the statute says that any person who offers or gives a thing of value to a government officeholder in exchange for official action is guilty of bribery. So, the key elements here are: offering/giving a thing of value, to an officeholder, in exchange for an official action.

In this case, the developer gave $10,000 to a commission member to get a zoning variance. The commission member then voted to approve it. But the twist is that the member testified he faked the agreement and would have approved the variance anyway, even without the money. Also, the developer showed that the other six commission members approved it, so maybe it wasn't just about that one member's vote.

The developer is being prosecuted for conspiracy to commit bribery. So, conspiracy requires an agreement between two or more persons to commit a crime, followed by at least one overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy.

Wait, but in this situation, the developer gave the money to the commission member, but the member didn't actually change his vote because of itâ€”he was going to approve it anyway. So, did the developer commit bribery? Because under the statute, it's about giving a thing of value in exchange for official action. But if the action would have happened regardless, does that matter?

I remember something about the "but for" test. For bribery, the payment must be a factor in the official decision. If the official would have acted the same way regardless, then maybe there's no bribery because the thing of value wasn't the cause of the action.

But this is about conspiracy. The developer conspired with the commission member to commit bribery. But if the commission member never intended to actually do anything different because of the money, does that negate the conspiracy?

Hmm, conspiracy is about the intent to commit the underlying crime. If the developer intended to give money to influence the official's action, and the official agreed to accept it, then perhaps they had a conspiracy. But if the official's agreement was fake, meaning he never intended to be influenced, does that affect the conspiracy?

Wait, in conspiracy, the agreement must be to commit the crime. So, the developer and the commission member supposedly agreed that the developer would give money, and the member would take it and approve the variance. But if the member never intended to approve it because of the money, does that mean there was no real agreement? Or is the agreement enough, even if the member didn't follow through?

I think for conspiracy, the actual successful commission of the crime isn't necessary, just the intent and an overt act. So even if the member didn't intend to do it, if he agreed to accept the money in exchange for the action, that might be enough for the conspiracy.

But wait, the developer's defense is that the commission member would have approved anyway. So, maybe the developer didn't think the money was necessary because the member was going to approve it regardless. But the developer still gave the money, thinking it would influence the member. So, the developer's intent was to offer a bribe, and the member agreed to accept it.

But another angle: if the member would have approved the variance even without the money, is there a thing of value exchanged in exchange for the action? Because the action was going to happen regardless. So, maybe the exchange wasn't for the action, since the action wasn't caused by the money.

Wait, but the statute says "in exchange for official action." So, if the official action was going to happen regardless, is the exchange valid? Or does the exchange require that the thing of value was a reason for the action?

I think the key here is whether the thing of value was given in exchange for the action. If the action would have happened regardless, then maybe the exchange wasn't for the action, so no bribery.

But this is about conspiracy. So, the issue is whether the conspiracy to commit bribery exists. Did the developer and the commission member agree to commit bribery? If the member never intended to actually take the money and give the variance because of it, maybe there was no real agreement.

Wait, but conspiracy doesn't require the commission of the crime, just the intent to commit it. So, if the member agreed to accept the money with the intent to influence his vote, even if he later changed his mind, that might still be a conspiracy. But in this case, the member testified that he faked the agreement and would have approved regardless. So, perhaps he didn't actually agree to be influenced by the money.

Alternatively, the fact that the member would have approved regardless might negate the necessity of the bribe, meaning there was no actual exchange for the official action. Therefore, the developer didn't commit bribery, and thus the conspiracy wouldn't hold.

Wait, but the developer gave the money in exchange for the approval. Whether the approval was actually influenced or not, the act of giving the money in exchange is what matters for the crime. So, perhaps the developer is guilty because he offered a thing of value in exchange for the action, regardless of whether the action was influenced.

But the answer options suggest that the question is about whether the developer is guilty or not. Option C says not guilty because the commission member didn't receive a thing of value since he would have approved anyway. That seems to hinge on whether the exchange was effective.

In some cases, the law looks at whether the official was actually influenced, but in others, it's about the offer and acceptance. For example, if a bribe is offered and accepted, even if the official would have acted the same, it might still be a bribe because the act of offering with the intent to influence is enough.

But under the statute here, it's about offering or giving a thing of value in exchange for official action. So, if the official's action was not influenced by the thing of value, does that negate the exchange?

I'm a bit confused. Let me think about the elements again. The statute requires that the thing of value is given in exchange for the official action. If the action would have happened anyway, the exchange wasn't for the action, so maybe it's not a bribe.

But the developer intended to influence the action by giving the money. So, from the developer's perspective, it was an exchange. But from the official's side, he didn't need the money because he was going to approve it anyway.

In some jurisdictions, the test is whether the public official was induced by the thing of value to perform the act. If he wasn't induced, then there's no bribery. But if the developer intended to influence him, and the official agreed to the exchange, even if he didn't intend to be influenced, does that count?

Wait, but the official's testimony is that he faked the agreement. So, he didn't actually agree to be influenced. So, perhaps there was no real agreement between them. The developer thought he was agreeing to accept the bribe, but in reality, he had no intention of doing so.

If there was no real agreement, then perhaps there's no conspiracy because conspiracy requires an agreement between the parties. If the commission member didn't actually agree to take the money in exchange for the action, then there's no conspiracy.

Wait, but in the scenario, the developer gave the money to the member, and the member voted to approve. But the member's vote was based on his own decision, not because of the money. So, perhaps the developer's intent was to influence him, but the member wasn't actually influenced.

In terms of conspiracy, the developer intended to commit the crime (bribery) by giving the money, and the member agreed to accept it. But if the member didn't really agree to be influenced, then maybe the agreement was a sham.

Alternatively, the developer's intent was to offer a bribe, and the member accepted it, so the conspiracy is formed regardless of whether the member actually intended to be influenced.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me look at the options again.

Option A: guilty because the member's agreement was enough for conspiratorial objective.

Option B: guilty because he gave the money in exchange for approval.

Option C: not guilty because the member didn't receive a thing of value since he would have approved regardless.

Option D: not guilty because there was no true agreement.

So, the issue is whether the agreement was real or fake. If the member faked the agreement, then perhaps there was no real agreement. But in terms of conspiracy, does a sham agreement count? Or does it require a genuine intent?

I think for conspiracy, the agreement must be a real agreement. So, if the commission member didn't actually agree to accept the money in exchange for the action, then there's no conspiracy. Because conspiracy requires an agreement between the parties to commit the crime.

So, the developer thought he had an agreement, but the member faked it. Therefore, there was no real agreement. Hence, no conspiracy.

Alternatively, perhaps the developer's act of giving the money and the member's acceptance, even if the member didn't intend to perform, is enough for the conspiracy. But I think the key is whether the member had the intent to commit the crime with the developer.

If the member had no intent to actually be influenced, then perhaps he didn't have the intent to commit bribery. So, the agreement was a sham, and thus no conspiracy.

Therefore, the answer would be D: not guilty because there was no true agreement between the parties.

The question revolves around whether the developer is guilty of conspiracy to commit bribery. The statute defines bribery as offering or giving a thing of value to a government official in exchange for official action. The developer gave $10,000 to a commission member to secure a zoning variance, which the member approved. However, the member testified that he would have approved the variance regardless of the payment, and the developer presented evidence that other commission members also approved it.

Key considerations include whether the commission member actually agreed to accept the money in exchange for the variance. Conspiracy requires an agreement between parties to commit a crime, followed by an overt act. If the member faked the agreement and had no intention of being influenced by the money, there was no genuine agreement. While the developer intended to influence the member, the lack of a real agreement between the parties negates the conspiracy.

Thus, the correct answer is D: not guilty, because there was no true agreement between the parties.

Answer: D
