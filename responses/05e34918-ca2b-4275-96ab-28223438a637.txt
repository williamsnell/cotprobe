Okay, so I need to solve this math problem: 13 over 14 plus 7 over 14. Hmm, let me think. Both fractions have the same denominator, which is 14. That makes things easier because when adding fractions with the same denominator, I just add the numerators and keep the denominator the same.

So, 13/14 plus 7/14. Let me add the numerators: 13 plus 7. Wait, 13 plus 7 is 20. So that would make the numerator 20, and the denominator stays 14. So the sum is 20/14.

But wait, 20/14 can be simplified further, right? Because both 20 and 14 are divisible by 2. Let me divide both by 2. 20 divided by 2 is 10, and 14 divided by 2 is 7. So that simplifies to 10/7.

Now, 10/7 is an improper fraction, which means it can be converted into a mixed number. How do I do that again? Oh right, I divide the numerator by the denominator. 7 goes into 10 once, with a remainder of 3. So that's 1 and 3/7. Alternatively, as an improper fraction, it's 10/7.

Looking at the options, let's go through them one by one. Option A is 20/28. Wait, 20/28 can be simplified by dividing numerator and denominator by 4, which gives 5/7. That's not the same as 10/7, so A isn't right.

Option B is 2 and 3/14. Let me see: 2 is 28/14, plus 3/14 is 31/14. That's way bigger than 20/14, so B is wrong.

Option C is 1 and 3/7. Well, 1 is 7/7, plus 3/7 is 10/7, which matches what I got. So C seems correct.

Option D is 2 and 1/14. That's 28/14 +1/14=29/14, which is more than 20/14, so no.

Option E is 3 and 2/7. That's 23/7, which is way bigger. So E's wrong.

Option F is 1 and 2/7. That's 9/7, which is less than 10/7, so no.

Option G is 1 and 1/7, which is 8/7, also less than 10/7.

Option H is 1 and 1/2, which is 3/2 or 10.5/7, but that's not matching.

Option I is 1 and 5/14, which is 19/14, still less than 20/14.

Option J is 1 and 4/7, which is 11/7, which is more than 10/7? Wait, 11/7 is 1.571, and 10/7 is about 1.428. So J is 11/7, which is more than our result. So no.

Wait, so the correct answer is C: 1 and 3/7. Let me double-check my steps.

13/14 +7/14=20/14=10/7=1 3/7. Yep, that's right. So the answer must be C.

The sum of 13/14 and 7/14 is 20/14, which simplifies to 10/7 or 1 3/7.
