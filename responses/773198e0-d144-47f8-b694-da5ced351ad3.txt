Question:

A 37-year-old man comes to the physician because of nonradiating low back pain for 3 days. The pain began after he worked in his yard. He has not had any change in bowel movements or urination. He had one similar episode 3 years ago that resolved spontaneously. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination of the back shows bilateral paravertebral muscle spasm. Range of motion is limited by pain. Straight-leg raising is negative. In addition to analgesia, which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?

Options:

A: MRI of the spine
B: Chiropractic treatment
C: X-rays of the spine
D: Lumbar puncture
E: Surgical consultation
F: Steroid injections
G: Acupuncture
H: Regular activity
I: Bed rest

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best answer for this medical question. Let's break it down step by step.

The patient is a 37-year-old man with nonradiating low back pain for three days. The pain started after he worked in his yard. He hasn't had any changes in bowel movements or urination. He had a similar episode three years ago that went away on its own. His vital signs are normal. On exam, he has bilateral paravertebral muscle spasm, limited range of motion, but the straight-leg raise is negative.

So, the question is about the next step in management after analgesia. The options are A through I.

First, I need to consider the likely diagnosis. The pain is in the low back, nonradiating, and started after physical activity. The fact that the straight-leg raise is negative suggests it's not a herniated disc because that test is positive in such cases. Since the pain is bilateral and there's muscle spasm, it sounds like a musculoskeletal issue, possibly a muscle strain or maybe a lumbar sprain.

The patient's history of a similar episode resolving spontaneously points towards a self-limiting condition, which is typical for muscle strains. These usually improve with rest and physical therapy.

Now, the options. Let's go through them:

A: MRI of the spine. Well, if the straight-leg raise is negative, and there's no neurological deficit (like foot drop or loss of reflexes), imaging like MRI isn't usually the first step. It's more for red flags, which aren't present here.

B: Chiropractic treatment. While some patients find relief, it's not necessarily the most appropriate next step. It's more of a treatment option and not always the first choice after initial management.

C: X-rays of the spine. X-rays are good for bony injuries but not for soft tissue issues like muscle strains. Since the pain is musculoskeletal and there's no suspicion of fractures or bony issues, x-rays might not be necessary.

D: Lumbar puncture. That's for neurological issues, like meningitis or disc herniation with cauda equina. But since the straight leg raise is negative and there's no neurological deficit, this seems unnecessary.

E: Surgical consultation. Surgery is for severe cases, like if there's a herniated disc causing significant nerve compression. But again, the straight leg raise is negative, so this isn't indicated.

F: Steroid injections. These are sometimes used for inflammation, but for a muscle strain, they might not be the first line, especially without more severe symptoms or if imaging isn't showing a clear issue.

G: Acupuncture. It can help with pain, but it's more of a supportive treatment and not the first step in management.

H: Regular activity. Encouraging the patient to stay active and not rest too much is actually beneficial. Bed rest beyond a day or two can worsen the condition because of deconditioning.

I: Bed rest. Short-term bed rest (like 1-2 days) might help, but prolonged bed rest isn't good for recovery. So, after the initial period, getting back to regular activities is better.

The patient's previous episode resolved on its own, which suggests this is likely a similar situation. The most appropriate next step, after analgesia, would be to encourage regular activity to prevent worsening and promote healing. So, option H seems best.
</think>

The patient presents with nonradiating low back pain following physical activity, consistent with a musculoskeletal strain. The negative straight-leg raise and lack of neurological deficits suggest no indication for advanced imaging or surgical intervention. Chiropractic treatment and acupuncture are options but not the most appropriate next steps. Encouraging regular activity promotes healing and prevents deconditioning, making it the best choice.

Answer: H
