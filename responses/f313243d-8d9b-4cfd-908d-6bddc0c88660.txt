Okay, so I've got this question about Arthur pointing out that Singer ignores certain principles regarding world hunger and poverty. I need to figure out which option is correct. Let me break it down.

First, I remember that Peter Singer is a philosopher known for his work on ethics, particularly in utilitarianism. He's famous for his arguments on animal rights and global poverty. His main idea is that we have a moral obligation to help others, especially when it comes to preventing suffering.

The question is about what Arthur says Singer ignores. So, the options are various principles, and I need to pick the right one from A to J.

Let me think about each option:

A: Sacrifice and reward. Singer's approach is more about maximizing overall well-being, so maybe he doesn't focus on sacrifice. But I'm not sure.

B: Right and good. That's a broad category. Singer does talk about what's right and good, so maybe Arthur is pointing out he ignores something else.

C: Contribution and entitlement. Contribution makes sense because Singer argues about contributing to those in need. Entitlement might relate to what people deserve, but I'm not sure.

D: Equality and harm. Singer does discuss equality in some contexts, but I think the main point is about helping the worst off, so maybe not.

E: Rights and desert. Singer talks about rights, especially animal rights, but desert (deserving) might not be central here.

F: Need and capacity. This sounds relevant. Singer emphasizes that we should help those in need, considering our capacity to give. Wait, but isn't that exactly what he does? So maybe Arthur is pointing out that Singer ignores another aspect related to need and capacity, perhaps.

Wait no, maybe the question is about what Singer ignores. Let me think again. I think Singer's approach is more about the consequences (utilitarian) rather than deontological principles like rights. So perhaps he ignores principles like rights and desert, focusing more on outcomes.

Looking at the options, E is rights and desert. So Arthur might be saying Singer ignores these. Alternatively, maybe it's about justice and fairness, which is J. Because Singer's approach is more about the greatest good, while J is about justice, which could be more about rights and fairness.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think about the context. Arthur is criticizing Singer, so maybe he's saying Singer doesn't consider certain principles. For example, Singer's approach is more about义务 (obligation) and benefits, but perhaps he doesn't address justice and fairness adequately.

Alternatively, the question might be referring to the fact that Singer's utilitarianism might not fully account for principles like rights and desert, which are more about what people deserve versus what's needed.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck. Let me try to recall. I think Singer emphasizes the duty to help, based on the ability to prevent suffering. So maybe Arthur points out that he ignores principles like rights and desert. So E would be the answer.

Wait, but another angle: Singer's approach might focus on what we can do to reduce suffering, regardless of whether it's deserved. So he might not prioritize desert (what people deserve) but focus on need. Therefore, Arthur might be saying he ignores principles of rights and desert, which are more about what individuals deserve rather than just need.

So I think the answer is E: the principles of rights and desert.

The question revolves around identifying which principles Arthur claims Singer ignores in the context of world hunger and poverty. Singer's ethical framework, particularly his utilitarian approach, emphasizes maximizing overall well-being and reducing suffering. This often leads him to focus on consequences and duties rather than certain deontological principles.

Analyzing the options, E: the principles of rights and desert stands out. Singer's work, especially regarding global poverty, focuses on the obligation to help those in need, considering our capacity to do so, rather than on desert (what individuals deserve) or rights in the sense of entitlement. Arthur might be pointing out that Singer's approach overlooks these aspects, which are more about individual deservingness and rights rather than the broader consequences of actions. Therefore, the correct answer is:

E
