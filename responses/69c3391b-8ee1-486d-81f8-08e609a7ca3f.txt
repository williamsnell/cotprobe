Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a Jamin refractometer, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what the question says.

The setup is that there are two tubes, each 30 cm long. One tube contains a gas at low pressure, and the other is a vacuum. When the gas is removed, there's a shift of 10 fringes observed for red light with a wavelength of 6000 angstroms in a vacuum. I need to find the index of refraction of the gas.

Hmm, I remember that a Jamin refractometer is used to measure the refractive index of gases. It works by comparing the interference of light in two tubes. When one tube is evacuated (vacuum), and the other has gas, the path difference changes, causing a shift in the interference fringes.

The formula I think is involved here is related to the change in the optical path length. The index of refraction, n, affects the optical path length, which is n multiplied by the physical path length.

The fringe shift is due to the change in the optical path difference (OPD) between the two tubes. Each fringe corresponds to a change of one wavelength (λ) in the OPD. So, a shift of 10 fringes means the OPD has changed by 10λ.

Wait, but the wavelength used is in vacuum, so λ_vac = 6000 A (angstroms). So each fringe shift corresponds to a change of λ_vac in the OPD.

Let me think about the setup. Initially, one tube has gas (n) and the other is vacuum (n=1). When the gas is removed, both tubes become vacuum. So the change in OPD will be the difference in the optical paths when the gas was present versus when it's removed.

Let me denote the length of each tube as L = 30 cm = 0.3 meters. But wait, the units might not matter as long as I'm consistent.

When the gas is present in one tube, its optical path length is n * L. The other tube is vacuum, so its optical path is 1 * L. The difference in optical path (OPD) is (nL - L) = L(n-1). 

But wait, actually, the OPD is the difference between the two tubes. So if one is nL and the other is L, OPD = (nL) - (L) = L(n-1). 

Wait, no, if both were gases, but here one is gas and one is vacuum. So the initial OPD is L(n - 1), because the gas path is nL and the vacuum is L. 

When the gas is removed, both become vacuum, so the OPD becomes zero. The change in OPD is from L(n-1) to 0, so the change is L(n-1). This change in OPD causes a fringe shift. Each fringe shift corresponds to a phase change of 2π, which is a path difference of λ. So the number of fringes, N, is equal to the change in OPD divided by λ_vac. 

So, N = (L(n-1)) / λ_vac. 

Wait, but wait, the problem says that when the gas is removed, the shift is 10 fringes. So the initial OPD was L(n-1), and after removing the gas, the OPD becomes zero. So the shift is the difference, which is L(n-1). 

So the shift in fringes is N = (L(n-1)) / λ_vac. 

Rearranging for n: 

n = 1 + (N * λ_vac) / L.

Given N = 10, λ_vac = 6000 A, L = 30 cm = 300 mm = 3e4 A (since 1 cm = 1e8 A, so 30 cm is 3e9 A? Wait, wait, wait. Let me double-check the units.

Wait, 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters. So 30 cm is 0.3 meters = 3e8 angstroms. Because 1 meter is 1e10 angstroms. Because 1 A = 1e-10 m. So 0.3 m = 3e8 A. Because 0.3 m * (1e10 A/m) = 3e9 A? Wait, no, 0.3 m is 3e8 A? Let me compute: 1 m = 1e10 A, so 0.3 m = 3e9 A. Oh right, 1e10 A in a meter. So 30 cm is 0.3 m = 3e8 mm? No, wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, 1 meter is 100 cm. So 30 cm is 0.3 meters. 1 A is 1e-10 meters. So 30 cm is 0.3 m = 3e8 A, because 0.3 / 1e-10 = 3e8. Yes, so L = 3e8 A.

So plugging in the numbers:

n = 1 + (10 * 6000 A) / (3e8 A)

Compute numerator: 10 * 6000 = 6e4 A.

Denominator: 3e8 A.

So (6e4)/(3e8) = 2e-4.

So n = 1 + 0.0002 = 1.0002.

Wait, but the options don't have 1.0002. Let me check the options again.

Options are:

A: 1.00002

B: 1.00007

C: 1.00001

D: 1.00004

E: 1.00005

F: 0.99999

G: 0.99998

H: 1.00003

I: 1.00006

J: 1.00000

Wait, none of the options is 1.0002. Did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Wait, maybe I messed up the units. Let me recheck.

Wait, 30 cm is 0.3 meters, which is 3e8 angstroms. Because 1 m = 1e10 A, so 0.3 m = 3e8 A.

So 3e8 A is correct.

So n = 1 + (10 * 6000) / (3e8) = 1 + (6e4)/(3e8) = 1 + 2e-4 = 1.0002.

But that's 1.0002, which isn't in the options. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the shift is 10 fringes, but maybe it's a shift in one direction or the other, but that shouldn't affect the calculation. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is different.

Wait, another thought: The Jamin refractometer measures the difference in optical path, and the number of fringes is proportional to the difference in optical path divided by the wavelength.

Wait, let me think again. The formula for the number of fringes is N = (n - 1) * L / λ.

So N = (n-1) * L / λ_vac.

So n = 1 + (N * λ_vac) / L.

So substituting:

N=10, λ=6000 A, L=3e8 A.

So (10 * 6000) = 6e4.

6e4 / 3e8 = 2e-4.

So n = 1 + 2e-4 = 1.0002.

But again, that's not an option. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I messed up the length. Oh wait, wait! Wait a second. The two tubes are each 30 cm long. But in a Jamin refractometer, the two tubes are placed in such a way that the light passes through each tube twice, once in each direction. So the actual path length per tube is 2L, because light goes in and reflects back, making the path twice as long.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, in a Michelson interferometer, the path is 2L for each arm. But in a Jamin refractometer, perhaps it's similar. So the optical path for each tube would be 2nL and 2L, respectively. So the OPD would be (2nL) - (2L) = 2L(n-1). 

Wait, that changes things. So the formula becomes N = (2L(n-1)) / λ.

So N = 2 * L * (n-1) / λ.

So solving for (n-1) = N * λ / (2L).

Thus, n = 1 + (N * λ) / (2L).

So plugging in the numbers again:

N=10, λ=6000 A, L=3e8 A.

So numerator: 10 * 6000 = 6e4.

Denominator: 2 * 3e8 = 6e8.

So (6e4)/(6e8) = 1e-4.

So n = 1 + 1e-4 = 1.0001.

Wait, that's 1.0001, which is option C: 1.00001. Wait, no, 1.0001 is 1.0001, but the options are to five decimal places. So 1.0001 is 1.00010, which is not exactly matching any option. The closest option would be C: 1.00001, but that's 1.00001, which is 1.00001, which is 0.00001, but according to the calculation, it's 0.0001.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Let me think again.

Wait, another possibility: When you remove the gas, the tube that was gas becomes vacuum, so the optical path changes from nL to L. The other tube was vacuum, so remains L. So the OPD when gas is present is (nL) - (L) = L(n-1). When you remove the gas, the OPD becomes zero. So the change in OPD is L(n-1). Each fringe corresponds to λ, so the number of fringes N is L(n-1)/λ.

So N = L(n-1)/λ.

Thus, n = 1 + (N λ)/L.

Which brings us back to the initial calculation: n = 1 + (10 *6000)/(3e8) = 1 + (6e4)/(3e8) = 1 + 2e-4 =1.0002.

But since that's not an option, maybe I'm missing something else.

Wait, perhaps the formula involves twice the length because the light goes through the tube twice? Like in a resonant cavity? Or perhaps the tubes are arranged such that the light reflects, making the path double.

Wait, in a Jamin refractometer, the setup is that one tube is filled with gas and the other with vacuum, and the light reflects back and forth between mirrors. So the effective path length for each tube is 2L, because the light goes in one direction and then the reflected light comes back.

Wait, but in that case, the optical path for the gas would be 2nL, and for the vacuum, it's 2L. The OPD is then 2nL - 2L = 2L(n-1).

So the number of fringes N is the change in OPD divided by λ.

So N = 2L(n-1)/λ.

So solving for n:

n = 1 + (N λ)/(2L)

Plugging in:

N=10, λ=6000 A, L=3e8 A.

So (10 *6000) =6e4.

2L=6e8.

So 6e4 /6e8 = 1e-4.

n=1 + 1e-4 =1.0001.

Which is 1.0001. Looking at the options, the closest is option B:1.00007 or option I:1.00006, but wait, no. Let me check:

The options are:

A:1.00002

B:1.00007

C:1.00001

D:1.00004

E:1.00005

F:0.99999

G:0.99998

H:1.00003

I:1.00006

J:1.00000

Wait, 1.0001 is 1.00010, but none of the options have that. The closest higher option is B:1.00007, but that's 1.00007, which is higher than 1.0001 (which is 1.00010). Hmm, that doesn't match. So perhaps I'm still making a mistake.

Wait, maybe the formula is N = (n - 1) * L / λ, without the factor of 2. Because perhaps in the Jamin setup, the light doesn't reflect, so the path length is only L, not 2L.

Wait, that would bring us back to n = 1.0002, which is not an option. So maybe I'm overcomplicating this.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem states that the shift is 10 fringes when the gas is removed. So the initial OPD is L(n-1), and after removal, it's zero. So the change is L(n-1), which equals Nλ.

So Nλ = L(n-1).

n = 1 + (N λ)/(L).

So N=10, λ=6000 A, L=3e8 A.

n=1 + (10*6000)/(3e8) = 1 + (6e4)/(3e8) = 1 + 2e-4 = 1.0002.

But again, no option matches. So perhaps I made a mistake in L's units.

Wait, perhaps L is 30 cm = 300 mm = 300,000 angstroms. Because 1 cm = 10,000 angstroms. So 30 cm = 30 * 1e4 = 3e5 angstroms.

Wait, that's a big mistake! Oh no, I think I messed up the unit conversion earlier. Let me redo that.

1 cm = 1e4 angstroms. Because 1 angstrom = 1e-10 m, 1 cm = 1e-2 m = 1e-2 / (1e-10) )= 1e8 angstroms? Wait no, wait.

Wait, 1 m = 1e10 angstroms. So 1 cm = 1e-2 m = 1e-2 * 1e10 A = 1e8 A. So 30 cm = 30 * 1e8 A = 3e9 A.

Wait, that's not right. Because 1 cm is 1e8 angstroms? Wait, 1 cm is 0.01 meters. So 0.01 m * (1e10 A/m) )= 1e8 A. So yes, 30 cm = 30 * 1e8 A = 3e9 A.

Wait, no! Wait, 1 cm = 1e4 micrometers, and 1 angstrom is 0.1 nanometers, so 1 cm is 1e8 angstroms. So 30 cm is 3e9 angstroms. So L = 3e9 A.

Ah! That's where I went wrong earlier. I thought 30 cm was 3e8 A, but it's actually 3e9 A.

So now, let's recalculate.

n = 1 + (N * λ) / L.

N=10, λ=6000 A, L=3e9 A.

So (10 *6000) =6e4.

6e4 /3e9 = 2e-5.

So n =1 + 2e-5 =1.00002.

Oh, that's option A:1.00002.

Wait, that makes sense now. So the correct answer is A.
</think>

The problem involves a Jamin refractometer with two tubes, each 30 cm long. One tube contains a gas at low pressure, and the other is evacuated. When the gas is removed, a shift of 10 fringes is observed for red light with a wavelength of \( \lambda_{\text{vac}} = 6000 \, \text{Å} \). The goal is to determine the refractive index \( n \) of the gas.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Fringe Shift and Optical Path Difference (OPD):**  
   Each fringe corresponds to a change in the optical path difference of \( \lambda_{\text{vac}} \). A shift of 10 fringes implies a change in OPD of \( \Delta \text{OPD} = 10 \cdot \lambda_{\text{vac}} \).

2. **Refractive Index Formula:**  
   The refractive index \( n \) can be calculated using the formula:  
   \[
   n = 1 + \frac{\Delta \text{OPD}}{L}
   \]  
   where \( L \) is the length of the tube.

3. **Unit Conversion:**  
   - \( L = 30 \, \text{cm} = 30 \cdot 10^8 \, \text{Å} = 3 \times 10^9 \, \text{Å} \).  
   - \( \Delta \text{OPD} = 10 \cdot 6000 \, \text{Å} = 6 \times 10^4 \, \text{Å} \).

4. **Calculation:**  
   Substituting the values into the formula:  
   \[
   n = 1 + \frac{6 \times 10^4}{3 \times 10^9} = 1 + 2 \times 10^{-5} = 1.00002
   \]

5. **Answer Selection:**  
   The calculated refractive index \( n = 1.00002 \) matches option **A**.

### Final Answer:
A: 1.00002
