Okay, so I have this economics question here about the United States producing rice in a competitive market. The question says that with free trade, the world price is lower than the domestic price. I need to figure out what must be true based on that information.

Alright, let me start by recalling some basic economics concepts. I remember that in a competitive market, the price is determined by the interaction of supply and demand. When a country is part of a free trade environment, it can import and export goods without restrictions.

So, the world price is lower than the domestic price. Hmm, that means that rice is cheaper on the world market compared to what it's selling for domestically in the US. In such a scenario, what happens? Let me think about supply and demand.

If the world price is lower, US producers might find it more profitable to sell their rice on the world market because they can get a better price there. But wait, no, the world price is lower than the domestic price. So if the US is currently selling rice at a higher domestic price, but the world price is lower, that might mean that the domestic price is higher than the equilibrium price without trade.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think of it this way: without trade, the US has its own supply and demand, which sets the domestic price. If the US opens up to free trade, it can import and export. If the world price is lower, that suggests that the US is a price setter or the world market is such that the US can influence the price. But in a competitive market, the US is a price taker, right? So the world price is lower than what the US would charge domestically.

So, when the domestic price is higher than the world price, what happens? Well, at the domestic price, the quantity supplied by US producers is higher than the quantity demanded by US consumers. That would create a surplus in the domestic market. Because when price is above equilibrium, quantity supplied exceeds quantity demanded.

So, with a surplus, what do countries do? They export the surplus to other countries where the price might be higher. Wait, but in this case, the world price is lower. Oh, wait no. Let me clarify: if the world price is lower than the US domestic price, then US consumers can buy rice cheaper from the world market. So, US producers might find it hard to sell all their rice at the higher domestic price, leading them to lower their prices or export to where the price is higher. But wait, the world price is lower, so exporting might not be profitable. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing up the logic here.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of comparative advantage. If the US is producing rice and the world price is lower, maybe it's more efficient for the US to import rice from countries where it's cheaper. So, when the domestic price is higher than the world price, consumers can buy cheaper imports, leading to increased imports and a decrease in domestic production.

Wait, that makes sense. So, if the world price is lower, the US will start importing rice because it's cheaper than producing it domestically. That would lead to a situation where the US has a surplus in its production, but since the world price is lower, they can't sell all their rice domestically, so they export. Wait, no, that's conflicting.

Let me try again. Without trade, the US has a certain equilibrium price where supply equals demand. When trade is allowed, if the world price is lower than the domestic price, US consumers can buy rice from the world market at a lower price. This would reduce the demand for domestically produced rice. As a result, US rice producers might have a surplus because they're producing more than what the domestic market can absorb at the higher price. So, to eliminate this surplus, the US would export the extra rice to the world market where the price is lower. Wait, but if the world price is lower, why would the US export? Wouldn't they be importing instead?

Wait a second, I'm getting this mixed up. If the world price is lower, the US can buy rice cheaper from other countries. So, US consumers will start buying more rice from imports, and US producers might reduce production because they can't sell as much at the lower price. Wait, no, the domestic price is higher. So, when the world price is lower, the US will import rice because it's cheaper. So, the US will have a surplus of rice? Or a shortage?

Wait, no. Let's think about it as the law of supply and demand. If the domestic price is higher than the world price, then at the domestic price, the quantity supplied is higher than the quantity demanded. That's a surplus. So, to eliminate the surplus, the US would export rice to other countries, but those countries might have a higher price. Wait, but the world price is lower. So, maybe it's the opposite.

Alternatively, perhaps the US would import rice, leading to a decrease in domestic production. So, the correct answer would be that the US begins to import rice to eliminate a domestic surplus. That would make sense because if the domestic price is higher than the world price, there's a surplus, so they import to reduce that surplus.

Wait, but why would they import to eliminate a surplus? Maybe it's the other way around. If the domestic price is higher, they produce more than needed, so they export to get rid of the surplus. But the world price is lower, so perhaps exporting isn't profitable. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the correct reasoning is that when the world price is lower than the domestic price, the US will import rice because it's cheaper. This importation will cause the domestic price to fall, reducing the surplus. So, option C says the US begins to import rice to eliminate a domestic surplus. That seems correct.

Wait, but let me think again. If the world price is lower, the US can import rice at that lower price. This would mean that US consumers buy more rice from imports, causing the demand for domestic rice to drop. As a result, US rice producers might lower their prices to match the world price, leading to a new equilibrium where the surplus is eliminated through imports. So, the US starts importing to eliminate the surplus.

Alternatively, if the US starts exporting, that would mean they're selling rice on the world market, but since the world price is lower, that might not be profitable. So, it's more likely that they import because it's cheaper.

Wait, but the question says the world price is lower than the domestic price. So, the US would import rice because they can get it cheaper. So, the correct answer is C: The United States begins to import rice to eliminate a domestic surplus.

Wait, but why would importing eliminate a surplus? Because when you import, you're bringing in more rice, which would increase the supply in the domestic market, but that would lower the price. Wait, no, that's not right. Importing increases the supply, which could drive the price down, but if the domestic price was higher, the surplus existed because supply was higher than demand.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to visualize the supply and demand curves. Without trade, the domestic supply and demand intersect at a certain price. With free trade, the US can trade at the world price, which is lower. So, the US will import rice because it's cheaper. This importation will cause the domestic price to fall, reducing the surplus. So, the US starts importing to eliminate the surplus, which is option C.

Alternatively, if the world price was higher than the domestic price, the US would export. But in this case, the world price is lower, so they import.

The United States produces rice in a competitive market, and with free trade, the world price is lower than the domestic price. In this scenario, the domestic price is higher than the equilibrium price, leading to a surplus of rice in the domestic market. To eliminate this surplus, the United States begins to import rice at the lower world price, which helps reduce the excess supply domestically.

Answer: C
