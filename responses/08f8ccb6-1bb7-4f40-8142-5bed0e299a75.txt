Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about Abraham Maslow's hierarchy of needs. The question is asking what each person is motivated by according to his theory. The options are A through J, and I need to pick the correct one.

First, I remember that Maslow's theory is about a hierarchy, which means different levels of needs that people pursue. The basic idea is that people are motivated by a hierarchy of needs, starting from the most fundamental to more complex ones.

Let me think about each option. Option A says "solely by their physical needs." I don't think that's right because Maslow's theory includes more than just physical needs. It goes beyond that to emotional, social, and self-actualization levels.

Option B is "striving for self-actualization and personal growth." That sounds familiar because I recall that the top of the hierarchy is self-actualization, which is about fulfilling one's potential. So this could be a strong contender.

Option C mentions "primary (physical) and secondary (emotional) needs." While primary needs are the lower levels like food and shelter, and secondary are social and emotional, Maslow's hierarchy has more levels than just these two. So maybe C isn't the complete picture.

Option D says "a constant state of dissatisfaction." I'm not sure about this. I think the idea is that once a lower need is met, the next one becomes the focus, but it's not necessarily about being dissatisfied all the time.

Option E is about "desire for power and dominance." I don't think that's the main point of Maslow's theory. It's more about personal needs rather than power over others.

Option F is the "need to fulfill societal expectations." That might be part of social needs, but I don't think it's the overall motivation as per Maslow.

Option G talks about "homeostasis needs determined by our inner self." Homeostasis is more of a biological concept, and while it's related, Maslow's theory is broader than just maintaining inner balance.

Option H suggests "motivation is derived from the fear of failing to meet needs." I don't recall fear being a central motivator in Maslow's theory; it's more about striving upwards once lower needs are met.

Option I is the "desire to achieve in the eyes of others." That seems related to esteem needs, which are part of the hierarchy but not the overall driving force according to the theory.

Option J is about "satisfying needs from the next step in the hierarchy." This might be a bit abstract. I think it's more about moving up the hierarchy once current needs are met, but the question is asking what people are motivated by, not the process of moving up.

Putting it all together, the hierarchy goes from physiological, safety, social, esteem, to self-actualization. The theory suggests that as lower needs are met, the higher ones become more important. So the overall motivation is striving for self-actualization and personal growth. That points me to option B.

The correct answer is B: striving for self-actualization and personal growth. Maslow's hierarchy emphasizes moving beyond basic needs towards self-fulfillment.

Answer: B
