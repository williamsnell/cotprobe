Okay, so I have this math problem here where I need to order some numbers from greatest to least. The numbers given are 3, 3 and 1 over 8, 3.8, and 3.18. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.

First, I should probably write down all the numbers clearly to make sure I understand them. The numbers are:

- 3
- 3 and 1 over 8 (which I think is a mixed number, so that's 3 1/8)
- 3.8
- 3.18

Now, I need to compare these numbers. I think the best way is to convert all of them into decimals so they're easier to compare directly.

Starting with 3, that's straightforwardâ€”it's already a whole number, so 3.0.

Next is 3 1/8. To convert a mixed number to a decimal, I can divide the numerator by the denominator. So 1 divided by 8 is 0.125. Adding that to 3 gives me 3.125.

Then, 3.8 is already a decimal. So that's 3.8.

Finally, 3.18 is also a decimal, so that's 3.18.

Now, I have all the numbers as decimals:

- 3.0
- 3.125
- 3.8
- 3.18

Now I need to arrange these in descending order, from the largest to the smallest. Let's list them in order.

Looking at the decimals, I know that 3.8 is the largest because it's more than 3.18, which is next. Then comes 3.18, followed by 3.125, and finally the smallest is 3.0.

So the order from greatest to least should be: 3.8, 3.18, 3.125, 3.0.

Now, looking back at the options provided (A to J), I need to match this order.

Let me look at each option:

Option A: 3.8, 3 and 1/8, 3.18, 3. That would be 3.8, 3.125, 3.18, 3.0. Wait, but 3.18 is greater than 3.125, so this order is incorrect because it places 3.125 before 3.18.

Option B: 3.18, 3.8, 3, 3 and 1/8. That's 3.18, then 3.8, which is wrong because 3.8 is larger than 3.18. So this can't be right.

Option C: 3, 3.8, 3 and 1/8, 3.18. That's 3.0, 3.8, 3.125, 3.18. No, because 3.18 should come before 3.125.

Option D: 3.18, 3 and 1/8, 3, 3.8. That's 3.18, 3.125, 3.0, 3.8. No, because 3.8 is the largest.

Option E: 3.8, 3.18, 3 and 1/8, 3. That's 3.8, 3.18, 3.125, 3.0. Yes, this matches what I thought earlier. So E seems correct.

Option F: 3 and 1/8, 3.8, 3.18, 3. So 3.125, 3.8, 3.18, 3.0. No, because 3.8 is the largest.

Option G: 3, 3 and 1/8, 3.18, 3. That would be 3.0, 3.125, 3.18, 3.0 again? Wait, the last 3 is the same as the first, which doesn't make sense. Maybe a typo, but not the correct order.

Option H: 3.18, 3 and 1/8, 3.8, 3. So 3.18, 3.125, 3.8, 3.0. No, because 3.8 is larger than 3.18.

Option I: 3 and 1/8, 3, 3.8, 3.18. That's 3.125, 3.0, 3.8, 3.18. No, because 3.8 is the largest.

Option J: 3, 3.18, 3.8, 3 and 1/8. That's 3.0, 3.18, 3.8, 3.125. No, because 3.8 is the largest, so it should come first.

Wait, but in option E, it's 3.8, 3.18, 3 and 1/8, 3. Which is correct as per my earlier analysis. So the correct order is option E: 3.8, 3.18, 3 1/8, 3.

But wait, let me double-check. The numbers in order are 3.8 (largest), then 3.18, then 3.125 (which is 3 1/8), and finally 3.0. So yes, option E is correct.

The numbers in decimal form are 3.0, 3.125, 3.8, and 3.18. Arranged from greatest to least, they are 3.8, 3.18, 3.125, 3.0. This matches option E.

Answer: E
