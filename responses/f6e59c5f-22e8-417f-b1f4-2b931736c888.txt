Okay, so I have this question about permutations and cycles. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The question has two statements:

Statement 1: Every permutation is a cycle.
Statement 2: Every cycle is a permutation.

I need to determine if each statement is true, false, or if there's not enough information. The options are A through J, with each option pairing a truth value for Statement 1 and Statement 2.

First, let's recall what permutations and cycles are. A permutation is a rearrangement of elements. In group theory, permutations are bijections from a set to itself. They can be represented as functions or, more concretely, as rearrangements of the elements.

A cycle in permutations is a specific type of permutation where elements are rotated around. For example, a cycle (1 2 3) means that 1 goes to 2, 2 goes to 3, and 3 goes back to 1. Cycles are fundamental in the study of permutation groups because any permutation can be decomposed into a product of disjoint cycles.

Wait, that's an important point. I remember that any permutation can be expressed as a product of disjoint cycles. So, does that mean every permutation is a cycle? Hmm, no, because a permutation can be a product of multiple cycles. For instance, the permutation that swaps 1 and 2, and separately swaps 3 and 4, is made up of two disjoint transpositions. This isn't a single cycle; it's a product of two cycles. So, not every permutation is a single cycleâ€”it can be a combination of cycles. Therefore, Statement 1 is false.

Now, Statement 2: Every cycle is a permutation. Well, a cycle is a specific type of permutation where the elements are arranged in a cyclic manner. Since all cycles are bijections (they are one-to-one and onto), they are indeed permutations. So, Statement 2 is true.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm not mixing up anything here. A cycle is a permutation, but not every permutation is a single cycle. So, Statement 1 is false and Statement 2 is true.

Looking at the options, I need to find the pair where the first is false and the second is true. Let me check the options:

Option H: False, True. That seems to fit.

But wait, looking back, the options are:

A: Not enough info, False

B: False, False

C: Not enough info, True

D: True, True

E: True, False

F: True, Not enough info

G: Not enough info, Not enough info

H: False, True

I: False, Not enough info

J: Both statements are partially true

So, yes, H is False, True. That matches my analysis.

I think that's right. So the answer should be H.

The first statement is false because not every permutation is a single cycle; they can be products of multiple cycles. The second statement is true because every cycle is a specific type of permutation. Therefore, the correct answer is H.
