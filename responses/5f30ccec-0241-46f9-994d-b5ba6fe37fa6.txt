Okay, so I have this logic problem to solve. The question is about translating the English sentence "All first-year students take a swim test" into predicate logic. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

First, I need to understand what the sentence is saying. It's making a general statement that every first-year student is required to take a swim test. So, whenever someone is a first-year student, they must take the swim test. 

Now, I should identify the key components of the sentence. There are two main parts here: being a first-year student (let's denote that as Fx) and taking the swim test (let's denote that as Sx). The structure seems to be that for every x, if x is a first-year student, then x takes the swim test.

In predicate logic, implications are used to express conditional statements. So, the structure would be "If Fx, then Sx." That translates to Fx → Sx. But wait, in logic, implications can also be written using the symbol '⊃', so Fx ⊃ Sx. 

Now, the sentence says "all" first-year students, which means it's a universal statement. So we need a universal quantifier, which is ∀x. Putting it together, the entire statement becomes ∀x (Fx ⊃ Sx). 

Looking at the options, I need to find which one matches this structure. Let's go through them one by one.

Option A: (∀x)(Sx ⊃ Fx) – This says if someone takes the swim test, then they are a first-year student. That's the converse of what we want. So it's not correct.

Option B: (∀x)(Fx ≡ Sx) – This is saying that being a first-year student is equivalent to taking the swim test. That's too strong because the original statement doesn't say that only first-year students take the test, just that all first-year students do.

Option C: (∀x)(Sx ∨ Fx) – This is saying that either someone takes the swim test or they are a first-year student. That's not the same as saying all first-year students take the test.

Option D: (∀x)(Sx ≡ Fx) – Same as B but using a different symbol; it's the same issue where equivalence is too strong.

Option E: (∀x)(Sx ∧ Fx) – This says every x is both a first-year student and takes the swim test, which isn't correct because not everyone is a first-year student.

Option F: (∀x)(Fx ∨ Sx) – Similar to C; it's an OR statement, not a universal implication.

Option G: (∀x)(~Sx ⊃ Fx) – If someone doesn't take the swim test, then they are a first-year student. Again, the opposite of what we want.

Option H: (∀x)(Fx ∧ Sx) – Same as E; not correct.

Option I: (∀x)(Fx ⊃ ~Sx) – If someone is a first-year student, then they do NOT take the swim test. This is the opposite of what we want.

Option J: (∀x)(Fx ⊃ Sx) – This matches exactly what we're looking for. It says that for all x, if x is a first-year student (Fx), then x takes the swim test (Sx).

So, after going through each option, J is the correct translation.

The correct translation is J: (∀x)(Fx ⊃ Sx).

Answer: J
