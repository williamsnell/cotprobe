Okay, so I have this question about John Stuart Mill's philosophy, and I need to figure out the right answer. The question is asking what Mill says we must do to determine whether one pleasure is more valuable than another. The options are A through J, and I need to choose the correct one.

First, I remember that Mill talked about happiness and utilitarianism. He said that the goal is to maximize overall happiness, and he distinguished between higher and lower pleasures. Higher pleasures are those that are more intellectual or refined, like art or philosophy, while lower pleasures are more physical, like eating or drinking.

Wait, but the question is about determining which pleasure is more valuable. I think Mill believed that pleasures can be compared, and the value isn't just about quantity but also quality. He had this idea of qualitative hedonism, where some pleasures are inherently better than others.

Looking at the options, option A says "determine which pleasure most experienced people prefer." That sounds a bit like Mill's idea because he thought that people who are more educated or have experienced more would naturally prefer higher pleasures. So maybe A is the right choice.

Option B says consult science. I don't think Mill's theory relies on science for determining the value of pleasures. It's more about personal experience and qualitative judgment.

Option C is about religious leaders, which doesn't fit because Mill was a utilitarian, and his approach was secular, not religious.

Option D says determine which is objectively most pleasurable. Well, Mill does talk about objectivity in the sense of higher pleasures being objectively better, but the method of determining that isn't about measuring but about experienced judgment.

Option E is about measuring intensity. Mill did talk about intensity, but I think he also considered the quality. The question is about determining which is more valuable, so it's probably more about the quality aspect, which relates to experience.

Option F is about attainability. I don't think that's the main factor for Mill. He was more concerned with the quality and the preference of those experiencing them.

Option G is consulting personal preferences. That seems too subjective. Mill's idea was that higher pleasures are preferred by those who have experienced them, not just anyone's personal preference.

Option H is about universal preference. That might be similar to A, but I think Mill focused more on those who are more experienced rather than what's universally preferred.

Option I is about duration. Mill did mention that some pleasures last longer, but the primary determinant is the quality, not just how long they last.

Option J is consulting past philosophers. That doesn't seem right; Mill was about current experience and judgment, not just past ideas.

So putting it together, the key point is that Mill believed we should compare the quality of pleasures based on the experiences of those who have lived them. Therefore, the correct answer is A: determine which pleasure most experienced people prefer.

The correct answer is A: determine which pleasure most experienced people prefer. This aligns with Mill's view that higher pleasures, which are more intellectually enriching, are preferred by those with greater experience and education.

Answer: A
