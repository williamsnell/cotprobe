Okay, so I've got this question here about numbers in different bases, and I need to figure out which list orders them from least to greatest. Let's see, the numbers given are Binary 1100, Decimal 11, and Hexadecimal D. The options are A, B, C, D, each listing the numbers in a different order.

Hmm, first, I think I should convert all these numbers to the same base so I can compare them easily. Maybe converting them all to decimal would work best since I'm more familiar with that system.

Starting with Binary 1100. I remember that binary is base 2, so each digit represents a power of 2. Let me break it down: the rightmost digit is 2^0, then 2^1, 2^2, and 2^3 as we move left. So for 1100, the digits are 1, 1, 0, 0. Wait, no, wait—actually, the rightmost digit is the least significant bit. So let me write it out correctly:

Binary 1100:
- The rightmost digit is the 0th position: 0 * 2^0 = 0
- Next digit: 0 * 2^1 = 0
- Next: 1 * 2^2 = 4
- Leftmost: 1 * 2^3 = 8
Adding those up: 8 + 4 = 12. So Binary 1100 is 12 in decimal.

Next, the Decimal 11 is already in decimal, so that's easy—it's 11.

Then, Hexadecimal D. Hexadecimal is base 16. I remember that in hex, the letters A-F represent 10-15. So D would be 13 in decimal. Wait, let me double-check: A is 10, B is 11, C is 12, D is 13, E is 14, F is 15. Yep, D is 13.

So now I have all three numbers in decimal:
- Binary 1100 = 12
- Decimal 11 = 11
- Hexadecimal D = 13

Now I need to arrange them from least to greatest. So let's list their decimal equivalents:

11 (Decimal), 12 (Binary 1100), 13 (Hex D).

So the order from least to greatest is 11, 12, 13. That means the correct order is Decimal 11 first, then Binary 1100, then Hexadecimal D.

Looking at the options:
A: Binary 1100, Decimal 11, Hex D → No, because 11 comes after 12.
B: Decimal 11, Binary 1100, Hex D → Yes, this matches 11,12,13.
C: Decimal 11, Hex D, Binary 1100 → No, because 13 comes after 12.
D: Hex D, Decimal 11, Binary 1100 → No, because 13 is the largest.

So the correct option must be B.

The numbers in decimal are 12, 11, and 13. Arranged from least to greatest: 11, 12, 13. The correct order is Decimal 11, Binary 1100, Hexadecimal D.

Answer: B
