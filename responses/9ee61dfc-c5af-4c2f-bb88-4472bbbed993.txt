Okay, so I've got this differential equation problem to solve. The equation is 4y'' - y = 0, with initial conditions y(0) = 2 and y'(0) = β. I need to find the value of β such that the solution approaches zero as t approaches infinity. Hmm, let's break this down.

First, I remember that this is a second-order linear homogeneous differential equation with constant coefficients. The standard approach for such equations is to find the characteristic equation. So, let me write that out.

The differential equation is 4y'' - y = 0. To form the characteristic equation, I'll assume a solution of the form y = e^(rt). Plugging that into the equation gives:

4r²e^(rt) - e^(rt) = 0.

Dividing both sides by e^(rt) (which is never zero), we get the characteristic equation:

4r² - 1 = 0.

Now, solving for r: 4r² = 1 → r² = 1/4 → r = ±1/2. So the roots are r = 1/2 and r = -1/2.

Therefore, the general solution to the differential equation is:

y(t) = C1 * e^( (1/2)t ) + C2 * e^( (-1/2)t ),

where C1 and C2 are constants determined by the initial conditions.

Wait a minute, but the problem states that the solution should approach zero as t approaches infinity. Let me think about what that implies. As t becomes very large, the terms in the solution will behave as follows:

- The term e^( (1/2)t ) grows exponentially, going to infinity.
- The term e^( (-1/2)t ) decays exponentially, approaching zero.

So, if we want y(t) to approach zero as t→infty, the coefficient of the growing exponential term must be zero. Otherwise, the solution would blow up. So, for y(t) to approach zero, C1 must be zero. That way, the solution simplifies to y(t) = C2 * e^( (-1/2)t ), which indeed approaches zero as t increases.

So now, with C1 = 0, let's apply the initial conditions to find C2 and β.

First, applying y(0) = 2:

y(0) = C1 * e^(0) + C2 * e^(0) = C1 + C2 = 2.

But since C1 is zero, this simplifies to C2 = 2.

Next, we need to find y'(t) to apply the initial condition on y'(0) = β.

Differentiating y(t):

y'(t) = (1/2) * C1 * e^( (1/2)t ) + (-1/2) * C2 * e^( (-1/2)t ).

Again, since C1 = 0, this simplifies to:

y'(t) = (-1/2) * C2 * e^( (-1/2)t ).

Evaluating y'(0):

y'(0) = (-1/2) * C2 * e^(0) = (-1/2) * C2.

We already found that C2 is 2, so:

y'(0) = (-1/2)*2 = -1.

But y'(0) is given as β, so:

β = -1.

Wait, but let me double-check. Did I make any mistakes in the differentiation? Let me see: the derivative of C1*e^( (1/2)t ) is (1/2)C1 e^( (1/2)t ), and the derivative of C2 e^(-1/2 t) is (-1/2) C2 e^(-1/2 t). Correct. Since C1 is zero, y'(0) is (-1/2)*C2. With C2=2, that gives (-1/2)*2 = -1. So β is -1, which is option J: -1.

I think that makes sense. By setting C1 to zero, we ensure the solution decays to zero. Then the initial conditions determine the remaining constants. So the answer should be J.

The differential equation is solved by finding the characteristic equation, leading to roots r = ±1/2. The general solution is a combination of exponentials. To ensure the solution approaches zero as t→infty, the coefficient of the growing exponential must be zero. Applying the initial conditions, we determine β = -1.

Answer: J
