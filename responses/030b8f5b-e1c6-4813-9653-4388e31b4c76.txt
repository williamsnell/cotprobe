Okay, so I've got this problem here about a binary component system. It says there are initially 3 grams of component A and 7 grams of component B. So the total mass is 10 grams. They've brought this system to a temperature where two phases are present. One phase has 5% A, and the other has 50% A. I need to find the masses of these two phases.

Hmm, I remember that in phase diagrams, when a system is in two phases, it's usually a mixture that's either side of the solubility limit. So each phase has a certain composition. I think the key here is to use the lever rule or something like that.

Wait, the lever rule is used to find the proportions of each phase based on their compositions. The idea is that the mass fractions are inversely proportional to the distances from the tie line.

So let me get the compositions right. The two phases have 5% A and 50% A. Let me denote them as phase alpha (5%) and phase beta (50%). The total mass of A is 3g and B is 7g, so total is 10g.

I think the formula involves calculating the mass of each phase using the difference in compositions. Maybe it's something like (composition of B phase - overall composition) divided by (difference in phase compositions). Wait, no, maybe I should think in terms of mass balance.

Wait, the overall composition of the mixture before phase separation would lie somewhere between these two phases. Let me calculate the overall mass fractions.

Wait, the initial mixture is 3g A and 7g B. So the mass fraction of A is 3/10 = 0.3 or 30% A, and 70% B.

But wait, after phase separation, the system has two phases. So the overall composition (30% A) must lie between the two phase compositions (5% and 50% A).

So the two phases are alpha (5% A) and beta (50% A). The overall composition is 30% A. Now, I think the lever rule says that the ratio of the masses of the two phases is inversely proportional to the distances from the overall composition.

So the distance from alpha to overall is 30% -5% =25%. From beta to overall is 50%-30% =20%.

So the ratio of masses is 25% : 20% = 5:4.

Wait, because the lever rule says mass_alpha / mass_beta = (composition_beta - composition_overall) / (composition_overall - composition_alpha).

So m_alpha/m_beta = (50% -30%)/(30% -5%) = 20%/25% = 4/5. Wait, no, wait: wait, the formula is m_alpha/m_beta = (c_beta - c_total)/(c_total - c_alpha). So c_alpha is 5%, c_beta 50%, c_total 30%. So (50-30)/(30-5) = 20/25 = 4/5. So m_alpha/m_beta =4/5. So m_alpha = (4/5)m_beta.

But the total mass is m_alpha + m_beta =10g. So substituting m_alpha= (4/5)m_beta into this:

(4/5)m_beta + m_beta =10 → (9/5)m_beta=10 → m_beta= (10 *5)/9 ≈50/9≈5.5556g. Then m_alpha=4/5 of that, which is (4/5)*(50/9)=40/9≈4.444g.

Wait, but wait, because the question says the system is brought to a temperature where two phases are present. So the total mass should still be 10g, right? Because mass can't disappear, it's just separated into two phases.

So m_alpha + m_beta =10g. From the ratio, m_alpha : m_beta =4:5. So total parts=9. Each part is 10/9 ≈1.111g.

So m_alpha=4*(10/9)=40/9≈4.444g, m_beta=50/9≈5.555g.

Looking at the options, option H is m_alpha=4.444g, m_beta=5.556g. Yes, that's what I got.

Wait, but let me double-check. Because sometimes I get confused whether the ratio is m_alpha/m_beta= (c_beta - c) / (c -c_alpha), which in this case is (50-30)/(30-5)=20/25=4/5. So m_alpha is to m_beta as 4 is to 5. So m_alpha =4/9 of 10g is 40/9≈4.444g. m_beta=5/9≈5.555g.

Yes, that matches option H.

To solve the problem, we use the lever rule to determine the mass of each phase. The system initially contains 3g of A and 7g of B, giving a total mass of 10g and an overall composition of 30% A. After phase separation, two phases form: one with 5% A (phase α) and the other with 50% A (phase β). 

Using the lever rule, the ratio of the masses of the two phases is inversely proportional to their distances from the overall composition. The distance of α from the overall composition is 25% (30% - 5%), and the distance of β is 20% (50% - 30%). Thus, the mass ratio of α to β is 20:25 or 4:5.

Given the total mass is 10g, we calculate the masses of α and β as follows:
- Total parts = 4 + 5 = 9
- Each part = 10g / 9 ≈ 1.111g
- Mass of α = 4 × 1.111 ≈ 4.444g
- Mass of β = 5 × 1.111 ≈ 5.556g

This matches option H: m_alpha = 4.444g, m_beta = 5.556g.
