Okay, so I have this physics problem here about calculating the work done when moving an object. The problem says the force is a variable force given by 5x^(-2) pounds, and the object moves along a straight line from x=1 foot to x=10 feet. I need to find the work done, and there are multiple-choice options provided.

Hmm, I remember that work done by a variable force is calculated using integration. The formula for work is the integral of the force over the distance moved. So, in this case, I need to integrate the force function from x=1 to x=10.

The force function is given as 5x^(-2) pounds. So, the integral of 5/x² dx from 1 to 10. Let me think about how to integrate that.

Wait, the integral of x^n is (x^(n+1))/(n+1), right? So, for 5/x², that's the same as 5x^(-2). The integral would be 5 * (x^(-1)/(-1)) + C, which simplifies to -5/x + C. So, the indefinite integral is -5/x.

Now, to find the definite integral from 1 to 10, I plug in the limits. So, I evaluate the integral at 10 and subtract the value at 1.

Calculating at x=10: -5/10 = -0.5
Calculating at x=1: -5/1 = -5

So, the definite integral is (-0.5) - (-5) = (-0.5) + 5 = 4.5.

Wait, that gives me 4.5, but let me double-check the signs. The integral from a to b is F(b) - F(a), where F is the antiderivative. So, yes, F(10) is -5/10 = -0.5, F(1) is -5/1 = -5. So, F(10) - F(1) = (-0.5) - (-5) = 4.5 ft-lb.

Looking at the options, option I is 4.5 ft-lb. So, that should be the correct answer.

The work done is calculated by integrating the force function from 1 to 10, resulting in 4.5 ft-lb.
