Question:

What is the role of psychological inconsistency in the theory of cognitive dissonance?

Options:

D: Psychological inconsistency is deemed irrelevant in the theory of cognitive dissonance and has no effect on behavior or attitudes.
E: Psychological inconsistency in the theory of cognitive dissonance is an indicator of mental illness.
F: Psychological inconsistency in the theory of cognitive dissonance leads to an increase in the dissonant beliefs or actions.
G: Psychological inconsistency in the theory of cognitive dissonance is typically resolved through the intervention of a professional therapist.
H: Psychological inconsistency in the theory of cognitive dissonance motivates a person to ignore the dissonant elements.
I: Psychological inconsistency in the theory of cognitive dissonance is resolved through the development of new, unrelated attitudes or actions.
J: Psychological inconsistency in the theory of cognitive dissonance motivates a person to change either the attitude or action that is responsible for the dissonance.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about cognitive dissonance. Let me start by recalling what I know about the theory. Cognitive dissonance is a psychological concept introduced by Leon Festinger. It refers to the mental discomfort or tension experienced by a person who holds contradictory beliefs, values, or ideas. The theory suggests that people are motivated to reduce this dissonance, or inconsistency, to maintain a state of psychological equilibrium.

The question is asking about the role of psychological inconsistency in this theory. So, the key here is to understand what happens when someone experiences this inconsistency. From what I remember, Festinger proposed that when there's a discrepancy between attitudes and actions, or between two attitudes, or between two actions, it creates dissonance. This dissonance is an uncomfortable feeling that drives the person to take action to reduce it.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: It prompts a person to increase the importance of consistent beliefs or actions. That sounds plausible because if someone's actions are inconsistent with their beliefs, they might try to strengthen their beliefs or change their actions to make them align.

Option B: Results in seeking external validation. I'm not sure about this. While dissonance can lead to justification, external validation might be a part of that, but is it the primary role? I'm not certain.

Option C: Leads to a state of equilibrium where dissonant and consonant elements coexist without change. Wait, equilibrium is the goal, but it's achieved by changing something, not just coexisting. So I don't think this is right.

Option D: Irrelevant and has no effect. No, that's not true because the whole theory is about inconsistency causing discomfort and motivating change.

Option E: Indicator of mental illness. No, cognitive dissonance is a normal psychological state, not a sign of illness.

Option F: Leads to an increase in dissonant beliefs or actions. That doesn't make sense because the theory is about reducing dissonance, not increasing it.

Option G: Resolved through therapist intervention. I don't think cognitive dissonance requires a therapist unless it's a clinical issue, which it's not in general.

Option H: Motivates to ignore dissonant elements. Ignoring might be a way to reduce dissonance, but I think the theory emphasizes more active reduction methods like changing attitudes or actions.

Option I: Resolved through new, unrelated attitudes or actions. I'm not sure. Maybe sometimes people develop new beliefs, but I think the main point is to address the existing conflicting ones.

Option J: Motivates to change attitude or action causing dissonance. This aligns with what I remember. People either change their attitudes, their actions, or add new beliefs to reduce inconsistency.

So, putting it together: Psychological inconsistency (dissonance) leads people to take steps to reduce it. The main ways are changing their attitudes, changing their actions, or adding new cognitive elements to justify the inconsistency. The question is about the role of inconsistency, so the role is that it's the driving force behind these changes.

Looking at the options, J seems correct because it states that inconsistency motivates a person to change either the attitude or action responsible for the dissonance. That's exactly what the theory saysâ€”people are motivated to reduce dissonance by changing one of the elements involved.

The role of psychological inconsistency, or cognitive dissonance, is to motivate individuals to reduce the discomfort caused by conflicting beliefs, attitudes, or actions. This is achieved by changing either the attitude or the action that is responsible for the dissonance.
