Okay, so I've got this math problem here: Use a number line to find the sum of −9 + (−8). The options are from A to J, and I need to pick the right one. Hmm, let's think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that adding negative numbers is like moving further into the negative direction on the number line. So, starting at −9, adding another negative number, which is −8, should take me further away from zero. 

Wait, no, actually, when you add two negative numbers, you add their absolute values and then keep the negative sign. So, 9 plus 8 is 17, and since both are negative, the result should be −17. Let me visualize it on a number line.

Starting at −9, if I add −8, I move 8 units to the left because adding a negative is like subtracting. So from −9, moving left 8 would land me at −17. That makes sense because −9 is already 9 units to the left of zero, and moving another 8 units left adds up to 17 units left of zero, which is −17.

Looking at the options, C is −17, so that should be the correct answer. Let me make sure I'm not mixing up the signs. Adding a positive would move right, but adding a negative moves left. So yes, two negatives added together give a more negative result. I don't think I made any mistakes here. So the answer must be C.

The sum of −9 and −8 is found by adding their absolute values and keeping the negative sign, resulting in −17.

Answer: C
