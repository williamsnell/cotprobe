Okay, so I have this chemistry question here, and I need to figure out which of the given options can form hydrogen bonds. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, I remember that hydrogen bonding occurs when a hydrogen atom is bonded to a highly electronegative atom, like oxygen or nitrogen. These atoms have strong electron-withdrawing abilities, which makes the hydrogen's proton quite positive, allowing it to form strong bonds with other electronegative atoms nearby, typically oxygen or nitrogen again. So, the key is to look for molecules where hydrogen is attached to O, N, or maybe F, which are highly electronegative.

Let me look at each option one by one.

Option A: CH3F. So, this is methyl fluoride. The central carbon is bonded to three hydrogens and one fluorine. Fluorine is highly electronegative, but in this case, it's bonded to carbon, not to hydrogen. So, the H in CH3F is attached to carbon. Wait, no, the structure is CH3F, so the fluorine is at the end. So the molecule is F-CH2CH3? Wait, no, wait. Actually, CH3F would be a methyl group with a fluorine attached. So the structure is CH3F, where F is bonded to C, which is bonded to three H's. So the H's are on the C, not directly bonded to F. So, the H's here are on carbon, not on F. So, no H attached to F. Therefore, these H's can't form hydrogen bonds because they're not bonded to an electronegative atom like O or N. So A probably can't form H-bonds.

Option B: CH3OCH2Br. Hmm, let's see. The structure here is O in the middle, connected to CH3 and CH2Br. So, the oxygen is bonded to two carbons and maybe a hydrogen? Wait, no, the formula is CH3OCH2Br. So, the structure is CH3-O-CH2Br. So, the oxygen is connected to CH3, CH2Br, and perhaps a hydrogen? Wait, no, oxygen typically has two bonds in such compounds. Wait, no, wait. Let me think: CH3-O-CH2Br. So, the oxygen is bonded to CH3 and CH2Br, but does it have a lone pair? Yes, O usually has two lone pairs. So, the oxygen here is an ether group. So, the oxygen has two lone pairs. But wait, for hydrogen bonding, the H needs to be attached to O, N, or F. In this case, the H's are on the CH3 and CH2Br groups. So, the CH3 has H's attached to C, and the CH2Br has H's attached to C. So, the H's are on C, not on O. But wait, the O in the ether can't form H-bonds because it's not bonded to H. Wait, no, wait. Oh, wait, no. The oxygen is in the middle, so it's not bonded to any H. Because the formula is CH3-O-CH2Br. So, the oxygen is connected to CH3 and CH2Br, but not to any H. So, the H's here are on the carbons. So, these H's can't form H-bonds because they're not attached to O, N, or F. So, the molecule itself doesn't have H's attached to electronegative atoms. So, B can't form H-bonds either.

Option C: CH4. That's methane. The H's are all attached to C. Carbon isn't highly electronegative, so these H's can't form hydrogen bonds. So, C is out.

Option D: CH3CH2CH2CH3. That's butane. All the H's are on C atoms. So, no H's attached to O, N, or F. So, D can't form H-bonds.

Option E: CH3NH2. That's methylamine. The structure is CH3NH2. So, the N is bonded to two H's and a CH3 group. Nitrogen is highly electronegative. So, the H's attached to N can form hydrogen bonds. So, in this molecule, the NH2 group has H's bonded to N, which can form hydrogen bonds with other N or O atoms. So, E can form H-bonds.

Option F: CH3CH3. That's ethane. All H's are on C, so no H's attached to electronegative atoms. So, F can't form H-bonds.

Option G: C6H6. That's benzene. It's a ring with alternating double bonds. All H's are attached to C, so no H-bonds possible. So, G is out.

So, the only option that can form hydrogen bonds is E: CH3NH2.

The ability to form hydrogen bonds depends on the presence of hydrogen atoms bonded to highly electronegative atoms like oxygen or nitrogen. Let us analyze each option:

- **A: CH3F**  
  Hydrogen is bonded to carbon, not to an electronegative atom like oxygen or nitrogen. Therefore, CH3F cannot form hydrogen bonds.

- **B: CH3OCH2Br**  
  The oxygen atom is bonded to carbon atoms, not to hydrogen. Thus, CH3OCH2Br cannot form hydrogen bonds.

- **C: CH4**  
  All hydrogens are bonded to carbon, which is not electronegative enough to form hydrogen bonds. Therefore, CH4 cannot form hydrogen bonds.

- **D: CH3CH2CH2CH3**  
  All hydrogens are bonded to carbon atoms, so CH3CH2CH2CH3 cannot form hydrogen bonds.

- **E: CH3NH2**  
  The nitrogen atom is bonded to two hydrogen atoms. Nitrogen is highly electronegative, so the hydrogen atoms bonded to it can form hydrogen bonds. Thus, CH3NH2 can form hydrogen bonds.

- **F: CH3CH3**  
  All hydrogens are bonded to carbon atoms, so CH3CH3 cannot form hydrogen bonds.

- **G: C6H6**  
  All hydrogens are bonded to carbon atoms in benzene, so C6H6 cannot form hydrogen bonds.

The only molecule that can form hydrogen bonds is **CH3NH2**.
