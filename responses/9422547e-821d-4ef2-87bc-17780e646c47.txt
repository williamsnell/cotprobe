Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about calculating the wavelength and energy of a photon related to the series limit of the Lyman series. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my spectroscopy, but let me think this through step by step.

First, I remember that the Lyman series is one of the spectral series of hydrogen, right? It's the series that corresponds to transitions where the electron falls to the ground state, which is the n=1 energy level. The series limit of the Lyman series would be the shortest wavelength in that series, which I think is the limit as the electron transitions from a higher energy level (like n approaching infinity) down to n=1.

Wait, so the series limit is the point where the wavelength is at its minimum, which corresponds to the maximum energy photon emitted. That makes sense because as n approaches infinity, the energy difference between n and 1 becomes the maximum possible. So the photon's energy would be the maximum in the Lyman series.

I think the formula used for the wavelength of such transitions is the Rydberg formula. The Rydberg formula for hydrogen is given by 1/λ = R * (1/n₁² - 1/n₂²), where R is the Rydberg constant, n₁ is the lower energy level, and n₂ is the higher one. Since we're looking at the Lyman series, n₁ is 1, and n₂ is approaching infinity.

So plugging in the values, when n₂ is very large, 1/n₂² becomes almost zero. So the equation simplifies to 1/λ = R * (1 - 0) = R. So λ = 1/R.

Wait, what's the value of the Rydberg constant R? I think it's approximately 1.097 x 10^7 m⁻¹. Let me double-check that. Yes, R is about 1.097373e7 m⁻¹.

So calculating λ would be 1 divided by 1.097373e7 m⁻¹. Let me compute that. 1 / (1.097e7) ≈ 9.105e-8 meters. Converting that to nanometers by multiplying by 1e9 (since 1 m = 1e9 nm), so 9.105e-8 m * 1e9 nm/m = 91.05 nm.

Looking at the options, option A is 91.17 nm, which is very close to my calculation. Hmm, but wait, maybe I should be more precise with the Rydberg constant's value. Let me use R = 1.0973731568507e7 m⁻¹. So 1/R is 1 / 1.0973731568507e7. Let me compute that more accurately.

Calculating 1 / 1.0973731568507e7 equals approximately 9.105717e-8 meters, which is 91.05717 nm. So rounding to four decimal places, that's about 91.06 nm. The options given are in two decimal places, so the closest would be option A, 91.17 nm. Wait, but my calculation gives 91.06, which is not exactly matching any option except maybe A if there's a rounding difference. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the Rydberg formula in terms of the series limit properly. The series limit wavelength λ is given by λ = 1/(R*(1 - 1/∞²)) = 1/(R). So it's correct.

Wait, another thought: sometimes, the Rydberg constant is given in terms of reciprocal meters, but sometimes people use different units or exact values. Let me check the exact value of R. The Rydberg constant R_H is approximately 1.0973731568507 × 10^7 m⁻¹. So 1/R_H is about 9.105717e-8 m, which is 91.05717 nm. But looking at the options, option A is 91.17 nm, which is a bit higher. So why the discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately. Let me compute 1 divided by 1.0973731568507e7 precisely.

Using a calculator:

1 / 1.0973731568507e7 = 9.105717e-8 meters, which is 91.05717 nm.

Looking at the options again: Option A is 91.17 nm, which is slightly higher. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Could I have made a mistake in the formula? Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the Rydberg formula for the series limit. Let me think again. The series limit occurs when the electron comes from n approaching infinity to n=1. So the wavelength is the limit as n approaches infinity. So the formula is indeed 1/λ = R*(1 - 1/1) = R. So λ = 1/R.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the energy of the photon, not the wavelength. But the question says to calculate both the wavelength and energy. Wait, but the options are only giving wavelengths. Wait, no, the question says "selecting from the answer A through to J" and the options are all wavelengths, but the question says to calculate both wavelength and energy. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Wait, no, looking again, the options are all wavelengths. So the question must be only about the wavelength part, perhaps. Or maybe I'm supposed to find the wavelength and energy, but the options are only for the wavelength.

Wait, but the question says "Calculate the wavelength and the energy of a photon..." but the options are all wavelengths. So perhaps the first part is the wavelength, and then the energy is another part, but the options given are only for the wavelength. So perhaps the question is only about the wavelength part, and the options are just the possible answers for that.

In any case, based on the calculation, the correct wavelength is approximately 91.06 nm, which isn't exactly any of the options. The closest option is A:91.17 nm, but wait, that's a bit higher. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that maybe the Rydberg constant used is an approximate value, like R = 1.097e7 m⁻¹, which would give λ = 1/(1.097e7) ≈ 9.105e-8 m = 91.05 nm. Again, that's not matching any option except perhaps A, but A is 91.17 nm. Wait, perhaps the series limit is actually the first wavelength in the series, which is when n=2 transitions to n=1, giving the longest wavelength in the Lyman series. Wait, no, the series limit is the shortest wavelength, which is the first line, or the limit as n approaches infinity.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the series limit with the first line. The Lyman series starts at the series limit (shortest wavelength) and extends to longer wavelengths. So the series limit is when n approaches infinity, giving the shortest wavelength of 91.17 nm, perhaps. Let me check an example. In some textbooks, the series limit for Lyman series is given as about 91 nm. So perhaps the correct answer is option A:91.17 nm.

Alternatively, maybe I should compute it more precisely. Let me compute 1 divided by 1.0973731568507e7 m⁻¹.

1 / 1.0973731568507e7 = approximately 9.105717e-8 meters.

Converting to nanometers: 9.105717e-8 m * 1e9 nm/m = 91.05717 nm.

Looking at the options, the closest is A:91.17 nm. But that's a bit off. Wait, perhaps the exact value is 91.16 nm? Because sometimes Rydberg's value is given as 1.097373e7 m⁻¹, so 1/1.097373e7 = 9.1057e-8 m = 91.057 nm. Maybe the options have a typo, or perhaps I'm missing a factor.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the Rydberg formula is expressed differently. Sometimes, the formula is written as 1/λ = R_H (1/n₁² - 1/n₂²). For the series limit, n₂ approaches infinity, so 1/n₂² approaches zero, giving 1/λ = R_H (1 - 0) = R_H. So λ = 1/R_H = 91.16 nm approximately.

Wait, let me compute 1.0973731568507e7 m⁻¹ precisely. Let's compute 1 / 1.0973731568507e7.

Calculating 1 / 1.0973731568507e7:

1.0973731568507e7 = 10,973,731.568507

So 1 / 10,973,731.568507 ≈ 9.105717e-8 m, which is 91.05717 nm.

Hmm, so still around 91.06 nm. None of the options exactly match, but option A is 91.17 nm. Maybe due to rounding in the Rydberg constant's value.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is not about the series limit but the first line of the Lyman series. Wait, the first line of Lyman would be n=2 to n=1. Let me compute that.

For n=2 to n=1: 1/λ = R (1/1² - 1/2²) = R (1 - 1/4) = (3/4) R. So λ = 4/(3R) = 4/(3*1.097e7) ≈ 4/(3.291e7) ≈ 1.215e-7 m = 121.5 nm, which is option C. But the question specifically mentions the series limit, which is the shortest wavelength, so that would correspond to the n approaching infinity case, giving 91.17 nm (option A) as the answer.

Wait, but earlier calculation gave me around 91.06 nm. So perhaps the correct option is A, given that it's the closest. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the Rydberg constant's value. Let me check another source. Oh wait, the Rydberg constant is approximately 1.097373 × 10^7 m⁻¹. So 1/R would be approximately 91.16 nm, which is option A:91.17 nm.

Ah, yes, so that's the correct answer. So the wavelength is approximately 91.17 nm, which is option A.
</think>

The Lyman series corresponds to transitions in hydrogen where the electron falls to the ground state (n=1). The series limit of the Lyman series is the shortest wavelength, which occurs when the electron transitions from n approaching infinity to n=1. Using the Rydberg formula:

\[
\frac{1}{\lambda} = R \left(1 - \frac{1}{n_2^2}\right)
\]

As \(n_2 \to \infty\), \(\frac{1}{n_2^2} \to 0\), so:

\[
\frac{1}{\lambda} = R
\]

The Rydberg constant \(R\) is approximately \(1.097373 \times 10^7 \, \text{m}^{-1}\). Thus:

\[
\lambda = \frac{1}{R} = \frac{1}{1.097373 \times 10^7} \approx 9.105717 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{m} = 91.05717 \, \text{nm}
\]

Among the given options, the closest value to this calculation is **91.17 nm**, which corresponds to option A. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
