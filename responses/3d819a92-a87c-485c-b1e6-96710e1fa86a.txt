Question:

A woman was seven months pregnant with her first child. One afternoon, the woman was in the kitchen of her home preparing a snack when she glanced out the window and saw a horrible crime being committed. The woman watched in horror as a local gang member pulled out a handgun and used it to shoot the victim, a member of a rival gang. The gang member did not know anyone was witnessing his act of shooting the victim. The woman watched as the victim collapsed and fell dead on her neighbor's front lawn. As a result of her shock from viewing this horrible incident, the woman suffered a miscarriage. If the woman asserts a claim against the local gang member who shot the victim, the woman will

Options:

A: recover, because she suffered a physical injury, rather than just emotional harm.
B: not recover, because the gang member was unaware that the woman was watching.
C: not recover, because the woman was not the intended target of the gang member's act.
D: not recover, because the woman voluntarily assumed the risk by watching the crime.
E: not recover, because the miscarriage cannot be directly linked to the gang member's act.
F: recover, because the gang member acted intentionally in shooting the victim.
G: not recover, because the woman was not within the zone of danger.
H: recover, because the gang member's act was a direct cause of her miscarriage.
I: recover, because the gang member's act was unlawful and caused harm.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this legal question about whether the woman can recover damages from the gang member who shot the victim. Let's break down the scenario first. The woman was seven months pregnant and witnessed a gang-related shooting. Because of the shock, she miscarried. She's suing the shooter. The question is about whether she can recover.

I remember that in tort law, particularly for intentional torts, there's something about emotional distress. But wait, there's a difference between emotional distress and physical injury. The woman didn't get physically hit, but she saw the crime and had a miscarriage. So is the miscarriage considered a physical injury?

I think the key here is whether she has a physical injury or just emotional harm. In some cases, witnessing a traumatic event can lead to physical manifestations like a miscarriage. But I'm not sure if that's enough. I recall that some jurisdictions require a physical injury for recovery in cases of emotional distress, especially if it's not a direct act towards the plaintiff.

Looking at the options, A says she can recover because she had a physical injury. E says she can't because the miscarriage isn't directly linked. Hmm. But the miscarriage was a result of the shock, so is that a direct cause? Or is it too indirect?

Also, option C says she can't recover because she wasn't the intended target. Intended target might matter for some torts, like assault, where intent is key. But for negligence, it's different. Wait, this might be an intentional tort, like battery or assault, but she wasn't the target. So maybe she can't claim battery because he didn't intend to harm her. But she might have a claim for bystander emotional distress.

Wait, there's the concept of bystander liability. If someone witnesses a tortious act and suffers emotional distress, can they sue? I think some places allow it if the plaintiff is closely related to the victim, like a family member. But here, the victim was a rival gang member, not her relative. So maybe that doesn't apply.

Option G says she can't recover because she wasn't in the zone of danger. The zone of danger test is used in some jurisdictions to determine if a bystander can claim emotional distress. If the plaintiff wasn't in immediate physical danger, they might not recover. She was watching from her kitchen, so she wasn't in the line of fire. So the zone of danger might not apply here.

Option H says she can recover because it was a direct cause. But if she wasn't in the zone, maybe it's not direct enough.

Option F says she can recover because the act was intentional. But if it wasn't directed at her, maybe intent alone isn't enough. The shooter didn't know she was watching, so he didn't intend to cause her harm.

Option I says she can recover because the act was unlawful and caused harm. But again, without a physical injury or being in the zone, would that be enough? Some places require a physical injury for recovery, others might accept emotional distress if it's severe enough, but the physical result (miscarriage) might be necessary.

Wait, but in some cases, a miscarriage can be considered a physical injury. So if she can prove that the shock caused the miscarriage, she might have a case. But then, option E says the miscarriage isn't directly linked. But the question says "as a result of her shock," so it's directly linked. So E might not be correct.

So putting it together, if the jurisdiction allows recovery for emotional distress when there's a physical manifestation, like a miscarriage, and she wasn't in the zone of danger, maybe she can still recover. But if the jurisdiction requires being in the zone, then she can't.

I think in some cases, even if not in the zone, if the distress is severe enough and causes physical harm, the plaintiff can recover. So maybe option A is correct because she had a physical injury (miscarriage), even though she wasn't directly targeted.

Wait, but some places require a physical injury for recovery, so A could be the answer. Alternatively, the reason might be that she wasn't the intended target, so C could be a reason not to recover.

But I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The shooter didn't know she was watching, so it's not intentional towards her. So for an intentional tort like assault, intent is key. But if it's negligence, maybe the shooter's action was negligent, but she wasn't the intended target.

Alternatively, if the shooter's act was so reckless that it could foresee that someone might witness and suffer harm, maybe she can recover under negligence. But I'm not sure if that's the case here.

In any case, the options are about whether she can recover. The key points are whether she has a physical injury and whether she was in the zone of danger.

If the answer is A, because she had a physical injury, but if the answer is E, because the miscarriage isn't directly linked, but the question says it was a result of the shock, so E doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, if the jurisdiction requires being in the zone of danger, then G would apply, and she can't recover.

I'm a bit torn, but the question seems to hinge on whether a miscarriage is a physical injury. If so, she can recover. So I think the correct answer is A.

The woman can recover because the miscarriage constitutes a physical injury, which allows her to seek damages for the harm she suffered.
