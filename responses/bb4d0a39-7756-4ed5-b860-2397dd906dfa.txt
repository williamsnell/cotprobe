Okay, so I have this question about Lee and George's argument regarding embryos and personhood. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is asking what Lee and George argue in response to the claim that embryos aren't persons because they lack certain rights, like the right to life. The options are from A to J, and I need to pick the correct one.

First, I need to understand the context. The argument presented is that embryos aren't considered persons because they don't have certain rights that all persons are supposed to have, such as the right to life. So, the opposing view is that since embryos don't have these rights, they aren't persons. Lee and George are countering this, so I need to figure out what their counterargument is.

I remember that in ethical debates, especially around abortion, one common argument is about when personhood begins. Some say it starts at conception, others at birth, and others when certain capabilities like self-awareness begin. The right to life is a key point here.

Looking at the options:

A: The right to life belongs to all living creatures, human or not. So this would mean even animals have it, which is broader than the question. But the question is about embryos being persons, so maybe not the focus here.

B: The right to life belongs to a human being at all times they exist. That sounds like a strong statement, implying that once you're a human, you always have the right to life.

C: Only beings capable of experiencing pain should have the right to life. That's more about sentience, which might be another argument, but I'm not sure if Lee and George focus on pain.

D: The right to life is not relevant to embryos. This would suggest that embryos don't have the right, which seems to support the original argument, so probably not what Lee and George say.

E: The right to life applies only to beings capable of thought and self-awareness. That's more about personhood criteria, but I'm not sure if that's Lee and George's point.

F: Embryos have potential personhood and should be given the right to life. Potential personhood is a concept I've heard before, where an embryo has the potential to become a person, so it's given rights on that basis.

G: Not all persons have the right to life, like murderers. This brings up exceptions but doesn't directly address embryos' personhood.

H: All of the above. That's probably incorrect because the options are specific.

I: The right to life doesn't apply to embryos because they're not independent. This seems to agree with the original argument, so Lee and George would likely disagree.

J: The right to life is granted at birth. This is a common view, but I'm not sure if Lee and George take this stance.

Now, from what I recall, Lee and George argue that embryos should be considered persons because they have the potential to develop into beings with characteristics like rationality and self-consciousness. They don't focus on the right to life directly but on the potential for personhood. So, option F seems to align with that, as it mentions potential personhood granting the right to life.

Wait, but looking at the options, option F says "have potential personhood and therefore should be given the right to life." That seems to fit, as Lee and George would argue that because embryos can develop into persons, they should be afforded rights now.

So, considering all the options, the best fit is F.

The correct answer is F. Lee and George argue that embryos have potential personhood and therefore should be given the right to life.

Answer: F
