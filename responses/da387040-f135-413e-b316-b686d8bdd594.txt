Okay, so I've got this question about human senses and their categories. Hmm, the question is asking how human senses are divided based on what they gather from the outside world. I'm a bit rusty on my biology, but let me think this through.

First, I remember that the human body has five main senses: sight, hearing, touch, smell, and taste. But wait, the options given don't list five; instead, they're grouped into two categories. So the question is about dividing these into two major groups.

The options are A to J. Let's look at each one.

Option A: auditory and visual. Those are two specific senses, but the question is about two major categories. So maybe not A, unless all other senses are grouped elsewhere.

Option B: internal and external. Internal would be like internal organs, but I'm not sure how that relates to senses. Wait, senses are about external stimuli, so maybe B isn't the right fit.

Option C: tactile and olfactory. Tactile is touch, olfactory is smell. That's two, but again, they're specific senses, not categories of how they gather info.

Option D: biological and physical. Not sure about that. Maybe not related to the way senses work.

Option E: energy and chemical. Hmm, this sounds interesting. Because some senses detect energy, like light (sight) and sound (auditory). Others detect chemicals, like taste and smell. So maybe the two categories are based on whether they detect energy or chemicals.

Option F: mechanical and thermal. Mechanical might relate to touch or hearing, thermal to temperature. But I'm not sure if this is the standard way to categorize senses.

Option G: bichromatic and trichromatic. Those terms relate to types of color vision, more specific to sight, I think.

Option H: conduction and transduction. These are processes, not categories of senses.

Option I: sensation and perception. Those are stages of processing sensory input, not categories of the senses themselves.

Option J: proximal and distal. Proximal refers to near, distal to far. So maybe how the stimuli are located, but I'm not sure how that divides the senses.

So, going back, the question is about what the senses gather. Energy could be things like light and sound, which are forms of energy. Chemicals would be taste (taste buds detect chemicals) and smell (olfactory receptors detect chemicals). So the two categories would be based on the type of stimuli: energy (like light, sound) and chemicals (like taste, smell). That leaves touch as detecting mechanical energy, but wait, mechanical is a type of energy. Oh wait, but in the options, E is energy and chemical. So perhaps touch is under energy? Because touch can involve pressure, which is mechanical energy. But then how does that fit?

Wait, the five senses: sight (energy - light), hearing (energy - sound), touch (mechanical and maybe thermal), taste (chemical), smell (chemical). So if we group based on whether they detect energy or chemicals, then energy includes sight and hearing, and perhaps touch (mechanical is a form of energy). Then chemical would be taste and smell. But the answer options don't have three, only two. So maybe the two categories are energy (sight, hearing, touch) and chemical (taste, smell). But the options don't have that; option E is energy and chemical. So that would make sense.

Alternatively, maybe the question is considering whether the senses detect energy or matter. So energy-based senses detect things like light, sound, which are forms of energy, while chemical-based detect molecules, like taste and smell.

So the two major categories would be energy and chemical. That would make option E the correct answer.

The human senses can be divided into two major categories based on the type of stimuli they detect. Senses like sight and hearing detect forms of energy (light and sound), while senses like taste and smell detect chemicals. Touch, which detects mechanical and sometimes thermal energy, also falls under the energy category. Therefore, the two categories are energy-based senses and chemical-based senses.

Answer: E
