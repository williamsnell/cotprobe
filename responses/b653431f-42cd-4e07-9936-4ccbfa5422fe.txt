Okay, so I have this question about Nagel and the core of the absolutist position. Hmm, I need to figure out what the right answer is. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I should probably recall who Nagel is and what his position on ethics is. I remember that Nagel is a philosopher who has written about moral theory, especially in the context of义务论 (duty-based ethics) versus目的论 (consequentialism). The question is about the absolutist position, which I think is a type of moral stance where certain actions are considered absolutely wrong or right, regardless of the consequences.

Wait, the question is asking what Nagel thinks is the core of the absolutist position. So, I need to remember what Nagel says about absolutism. I think he contrasts absolutism with relativism or maybe with other ethical theories.

Looking at the options, let's go through them one by one.

Option A: All actions are morally equivalent. That seems more like a kind of moral nihilism or relativism where nothing is right or wrong, just whatever. I don't think Nagel's absolutism is about equivalence; rather, it's about certain actions being absolutely wrong.

Option B: It is permissible to harm as a foreseen but unintended consequence. That sounds more like a consequentialist idea, perhaps related to the doctrine of double effect. I'm not sure if Nagel's absolutism would endorse this. In fact, I think absolutists might reject causing harm even if unintended.

Option C: The ends justify the means. That's a classic consequentialist view, often associated with utilitarianism. But Nagel is critical of this, so I don't think this is the core of his absolutist position.

Option D: Individuals should always act in their own best interest. That's more of a egoist or self-interested perspective, like what Bentham or some others might suggest. Nagel's absolutism is about moral duties, so this seems off.

Option E: The moral worth of an action is determined by its outcome. Again, this is a consequentialist view. Nagel's absolutism probably doesn't agree with this because he's arguing against ends-justifying-means approaches.

Option F: No action can be morally justified. That sounds like a very strong statement, maybe from an extreme relativist or a skeptic. I don't think Nagel is saying that; rather, he's arguing for certain moral principles.

Option G: Morality is subjective and varies from person to person. That's moral relativism. Nagel is arguing against relativism, so this is not the core of his absolutist position.

Option H: The hostility should be directed at its true object. I'm not too familiar with this one. It might relate to how to properly direct anger, but I'm not sure how this ties into Nagel's absolutism. Maybe it's about justifying actions towards the right targets, but I'm not certain.

Option I: Human persons have a right to life. This seems like a specific moral stance, perhaps a deontological one, but is this the core of absolutism? Nagel might argue that some rights are absolute, but I'm not sure if this is the core he's referring to.

Option J: Each person should pursue his or her own happiness. That's a utilitarian or perhaps hedonistic idea, focusing on individual well-being. Nagel's position is more about duties and absolute moral rules, so this doesn't fit.

Wait, going back, the question is about the core of the absolutist position as Nagel thinks it. From what I remember, Nagel's "The Possibility of Altruism" argues against psychological egoism, but this question is about the absolutist position in ethics.

Absolutism in ethics, as I understand, holds that certain moral rules are always binding, regardless of the situation. So, for example, telling the truth is always right, regardless of the consequences. This is in contrast to relativism or consequentialism.

Looking at the options again, option C is about ends justifying means, which is the opposite of absolutism. So Nagel would reject that as the core of absolutism.

Option E is also about outcomes determining morality, so again, not the core of absolutism.

Option I is about human rights, but I'm not sure if that's the core of the absolutist position as Nagel defines it.

Wait, perhaps the core is that certain actions are absolutely wrong, regardless of outcomes. So, maybe the ends don't justify the means. That would be against option C. But looking at the options, none directly say that.

Wait, option B says it's permissible to harm as a foreseen but unintended consequence. That might relate to the doctrine of double effect, where unintended side effects are permissible. But Nagel, as an absolutist, might argue against this, saying that even unintended harm is wrong.

Option H talks about directing hostility at the true object. Maybe this is about justifying actions towards the right target, like in war, you can target military but not civilians. But I'm not sure if that's the core of Nagel's absolutism.

Wait, perhaps the answer is option E: the moral worth is determined by outcome. But Nagel would argue against that, as he supports a duty-based approach. So the core of absolutism would be that outcomes aren't the only thing determining morality, but that's more of a contrast than the core.

Alternatively, maybe the core is that certain actions are always wrong, so perhaps none of the options directly state that. Let me think again.

Wait, the options are about what Nagel thinks the core is. From what I recall, Nagel argues that the absolutist position holds that some actions are wrong in themselves, regardless of the consequences. So the core is that certain actions are intrinsically wrong, not based on outcomes.

Looking at the options, none directly say that, but perhaps option C is the opposite. Or maybe option E is the opposite. If the core of absolutism is that outcomes don't matter, then the ends don't justify the means. So, the opposite of option C.

Wait, the question is what Nagel thinks the core is. So, for Nagel, the core of the absolutist position is that certain actions are always wrong, regardless of the outcome. So, the ends do not justify the means. Therefore, the opposite of option C, but the question is about what the absolutist position's core is, so Nagel would say that the core is that the ends do not justify the means, which would mean that the permissible thing is not to have the ends justify the means. So, perhaps option C is the opposite of what the absolutist holds.

Wait, the question is, Nagel thinks the core of the absolutist position is. So, if the absolutist position is that the ends do not justify the means, then the core is that the ends don't justify the means. But looking at the options, option C says "the ends justify the means," which would be the opposite. So, if Nagel is arguing against that, then the core of the absolutist position is that the ends do not justify the means, which is not directly listed. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the core is that certain actions are always wrong, regardless of consequences. So, looking for that in the options. Option I is about the right to life, which is a specific right, but perhaps not the broader concept.

Alternatively, maybe the core is that the moral worth is determined by something other than outcomes. Option E says "the moral worth of an action is determined by its outcome," which is a consequentialist view. So, Nagel would argue that the absolutist position doesn't base moral worth on outcomes, so the core is the opposite of E.

Wait, but the question is asking what the core is, according to Nagel. So, if the absolutist position is opposed to E, then the core would be that the moral worth isn't determined by outcome. But none of the options state that. So perhaps the answer is E is not the core, but the opposite is.

Alternatively, perhaps the core is that the ends do not justify the means, which would be the opposite of option C. So, if the options don't have that, perhaps the answer is C, but that would be the opposite of what the absolutist holds. Wait, no, the question is what the absolutist position's core is, so if Nagel is explaining their position, he would say their core is C. But I'm confused.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about this again. Nagel is critical of the absolutist position because he thinks it's too rigid, but he also presents it as a rival to relativism. The core of the absolutist position is that there are absolute moral truths, such as certain actions are always wrong, regardless of context. So, in that sense, the core is that some actions are intrinsically wrong.

Looking at the options, none directly say that. But perhaps the closest is option C: the ends justify the means, which is a way of saying that outcomes can override the means, which the absolutist would reject. So, if the question is what the absolutist position's core is, and Nagel is explaining that, then perhaps the answer is C, but that would mean that Nagel is saying the core is that the ends justify the means, which I don't think is correct because Nagel is arguing against that.

Wait, no. The question is what the absolutist position's core is, according to Nagel. So, Nagel is explaining their position. The absolutist believes that certain actions are always wrong, regardless of the consequences. So, the core would be that the ends do not justify the means. But the options don't have that; option C is the opposite.

Wait, perhaps the answer is E: the moral worth is determined by its outcome. But Nagel would argue that the absolutist doesn't think that. So, perhaps the answer is E is the opposite, and the correct core is that outcomes don't determine worth, which is not among the options. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the answer is H: the hostility should be directed at its true object. I'm not sure, but perhaps it's about justifying actions towards the correct target, which is a way of saying that even if you have to act, you must direct it properly, which might be part of an absolutist approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is I: human persons have a right to life. That's a specific right, but I'm not sure if that's the core of the absolutist position.

Wait, perhaps I should think about Nagel's "The Possibility of Altruism." In that work, he argues against psychological egoism, suggesting that altruism is possible. But that's more about motivation than the structure of morality.

Wait, another angle: the question is about the core of the absolutist position. The absolutist in ethics believes in absolute moral rules. So, for example, lying is always wrong. This is opposed to a consequentialist who might say lying is wrong only if it leads to worse consequences.

So, the core is that certain actions are intrinsically right or wrong, regardless of outcomes. So, the moral worth is not determined by the outcome but by the action itself. Looking at the options, option E says the moral worth is determined by outcome, which is the opposite of what the absolutist holds. So, if the question is what the absolutist position's core is, then it's not E. Instead, the core is that the action's nature determines its morality, not the outcome.

But none of the options directly state that. So perhaps the answer is E is the opposite, but the question is about what Nagel thinks the core is, which would be that the outcome doesn't determine it.

Wait, perhaps the answer is I: human persons have a right to life. That's a specific right, but maybe the absolutist position holds that certain rights are absolute, like the right to life. But I'm not sure if that's the core.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is H: the hostility should be directed at its true object. Maybe this is about just war theory, where you can target military but not civilians. But I'm not certain.

Wait, maybe I should think about the term "absolutist position." It's a position that rejects moral relativism, holding that there are absolute moral truths. So, the core is that some actions are always wrong, regardless of context.

Looking back at the options, option C is "the ends justify the means," which is a consequentialist view. The absolutist would say that some means are inherently wrong, regardless of the ends. So, the core of the absolutist position is that the ends do not justify the means, which is the opposite of option C. But since the question is what the absolutist's core is, Nagel would say it's that the ends don't justify the means, which is not directly an option.

Wait, perhaps the answer is E: the moral worth is determined by outcome. If the absolutist doesn't think that, then the core is that it's not determined by outcome. But the options don't have that. So maybe the answer is E is incorrect, and the core is something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is option I: human persons have a right to life. This is a specific application, but maybe Nagel's absolutism includes this as a core principle.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to recall any specific arguments Nagel has made. In "The Possibility of Altruism," he argues against psychological egoism, but that's about motivation, not the structure of morality. In other works, like "Moral Luck," he discusses how moral responsibility can be affected by factors beyond our control, which relates to absolutism.

Wait, perhaps the answer is option I: human persons have a right to life. Because Nagel is an absolutist, he might hold that certain rights, like the right to life, are absolute. So, the core would be that individuals have a right to life, making option I correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is option E: the moral worth is determined by outcome. But that's the opposite of what I think Nagel would say.

Wait, another approach: the question is about the core of the absolutist position. So, for example, in medical ethics, an absolutist might say that killing is always wrong, regardless of the benefits. So, the core is that certain actions are absolutely forbidden.

Looking at the options again, none directly state that. So perhaps the closest is option I: human persons have a right to life, which aligns with that idea.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is option C: the ends justify the means, but that's the opposite of what the absolutist holds.

Wait, I'm getting more confused. Maybe I should look for which option is the opposite of what Nagel supports. Since Nagel is against the idea that the ends justify the means, the core of the absolutist position must be that the ends do not justify the means, which isn't directly an option. So perhaps the answer is option C, but that's the opposite.

Wait, no, the question is what the absolutist's core is. So, if the absolutist believes in ends not justifying the means, then the core is that the ends don't matter, which isn't an option. Alternatively, perhaps the core is that some actions are always wrong, which again isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps the answer is option E: the moral worth is determined by outcome. But Nagel would argue against that, so the core of the absolutist position is that it's not determined by outcome.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of this differently. The question is about the core of the absolutist position as Nagel defines it. So, perhaps the answer is option I: human persons have a right to life, as a specific example of an absolute moral right.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is option H: the hostility should be directed at its true object. This might relate to justifying actions based on proper targets, which could be part of an absolutist approach in war or self-defense.

Wait, I'm still not sure. Let me try to think of it this way: the absolutist position is that certain moral rules are absolute, so the core is that some actions are always wrong, regardless of context. Looking for that in the options, perhaps option I is about human rights, which is a specific absolute rule.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is option E, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: the question is about the core, so perhaps it's about the foundational principle. For absolutists, it's that certain actions are intrinsically wrong. So, the moral worth is determined by the action itself, not the outcome. So, the opposite of option E.

But since the options don't have that, perhaps the answer is E is incorrect, and the core is something else.

Wait, maybe the answer is option I: human persons have a right to life. Because that's a right that is absolute, regardless of circumstances.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is option H: the hostility should be directed at its true object. Maybe this is about the principle that you can only act on legitimate targets, which is part of an absolutist approach.

Wait, I'm still stuck. Let me try to recall any specific points from Nagel's work. In his essay "War and Moral Responsibility," Nagel discusses the ethics of war, where he might argue that even in war, certain actions are absolutely wrong, like targeting civilians. So, the core might be that the true object (like military targets) should be the focus of hostility, making option H correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is option I, but I'm not certain.

Wait, considering that the question is about the core of the absolutist position, which is about absolute moral rules, perhaps the answer is option I: human persons have a right to life. Because that's an absolute right, and Nagel's absolutism would support that.

But I'm not entirely confident. Another way: if the ends justify the means, that's option C. The absolutist would say that some means are wrong regardless of ends, so the core is that the ends don't justify the means. But since the options don't have that, perhaps the answer is C, but that's the opposite.

Wait, no. The question is what the absolutist's core is, so if Nagel is explaining their position, he'd say their core is that the ends do justify the means, which would be option C. But that can't be right because Nagel is critical of that.

Wait, I'm getting myself confused. Let me try to think differently. The absolutist position holds that some actions are always wrong, regardless of the consequences. So, the core is the belief in absolute moral rules. Looking at the options, none directly say that, but perhaps option I is the closest, as it's about an absolute right.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is option E, but that's about outcomes determining worth, which the absolutist rejects.

Wait, perhaps the answer is option I: human persons have a right to life. Because that's a specific absolute right, and Nagel's absolutism would include that as part of the core.

I think I've circled enough. I'll go with option I.
</think>

The question asks about the core of the absolutist position as Nagel defines it. Nagel's absolutist position in ethics holds that certain moral rules are absolute and binding, regardless of context or consequences. This means that some actions are intrinsically right or wrong, and the ends do not justify the means. Among the options provided, the closest alignment to this idea is option I: "human persons have a right to life," as it reflects an absolute moral principle that resonates with Nagel's absolutist stance.

Answer: I
