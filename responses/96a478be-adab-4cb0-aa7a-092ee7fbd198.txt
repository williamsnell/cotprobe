Question:

Kerri ran the same distance in four different races. Her times were 18.04 seconds, 21.39 seconds, 12.99 seconds, and 14.14 seconds. If the individual times are rounded to the nearest one-tenth of a second, what is the estimate of Kerri's total time for all four races?

Options:

A: 66.5 seconds
B: 64.5 seconds
C: 65.6 seconds
D: 66.6 seconds
E: 68 seconds
F: 65.5 seconds
G: 66.4 seconds
H: 66 seconds
I: 67 seconds
J: 67.5 seconds

Okay, so Kerri ran four races, and I need to figure out her total time when each race's time is rounded to the nearest tenth of a second. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I'll list out the times she had in each race: 18.04, 21.39, 12.99, and 14.14 seconds. The problem says to round each of these to the nearest tenth before adding them up.

Rounding to the nearest tenth means looking at the hundredths place. If the hundredths digit is 5 or above, we round up the tenths place by one. If it's less than 5, we leave the tenths place as is.

Let's go through each time:

1. **18.04 seconds**: The tenths place is 0, and the hundredths is 4. Since 4 is less than 5, we round down, so it stays 18.0.

2. **21.39 seconds**: The tenths place is 3, and the hundredths is 9. 9 is more than 5, so we round up the tenths place. 3 becomes 4, making it 21.4.

3. **12.99 seconds**: Tenths place is 9, hundredths is 9. Again, 9 is more than 5, so we round up the tenths place. 9 becomes 10, but since we're dealing with tenths, adding 1 makes it 13.0. Wait, no, wait. Let me correct that. Tenths place is 9, so adding 1 would make it 10 in the tenths, which would carry over. So 12.99 rounded to the nearest tenth is actually 13.0 because 99 hundredths is almost a full second. So yes, it becomes 13.0.

4. **14.14 seconds**: Tenths place is 1, hundredths is 4. Since 4 is less than 5, we round down, keeping it at 14.1.

Wait, did I handle the third one correctly? Let me double-check. 12.99: the tenths digit is 9, and the hundredths is 9. So yes, since 9 ≥5, we round up. But 9 in tenths plus 1 is 10, so the tenths place becomes 0 and we add 1 to the ones place. So 12.99 becomes 13.0.

Now, adding up the rounded times:

18.0 + 21.4 + 13.0 + 14.1 = ?

Let me add them step by step.

First, 18.0 + 21.4 = 39.4.

Then, 39.4 + 13.0 = 52.4.

Next, 52.4 + 14.1 = 66.5.

Wait, but looking at the options, 66.5 is option A. But I remember sometimes when rounding, especially with money or measurements, we have to be careful about the total. But wait, let me recount each rounding step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

18.04 → 18.0 (correct)
21.39 → 21.4 (correct)
12.99 → 13.0 (correct)
14.14 → 14.1 (correct)

Adding them: 18 + 21.4 is 39.4. Then 39.4 +13 is 52.4. 52.4 +14.1 is 66.5. So that's 66.5, which is option A.

Wait, but looking at the options again: A is 66.5, which seems correct. However, let me check if I added correctly.

18.04 →18.0

21.39 →21.4

12.99 →13.0

14.14 →14.1

Adding:

18.0 + 21.4 = 39.4

39.4 +13.0 = 52.4

52.4 +14.1 = 66.5.

Yes, that's correct. So the total is 66.5 seconds, which is option A.

The times are rounded to the nearest tenth, then summed: 18.0 + 21.4 + 13.0 + 14.1 = 66.5 seconds.

Answer: A
