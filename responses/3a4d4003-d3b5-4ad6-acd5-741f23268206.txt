Okay, so I need to solve the equation 2x³ + e^x = 10 using the Newton-Raphson method. Hmm, I remember that the Newton-Raphson method is a way to find roots of equations, so I guess I need to rearrange this equation into the form f(x) = 0. Let me think, if I subtract 10 from both sides, I get 2x³ + e^x - 10 = 0. So f(x) is 2x³ + e^x - 10. 

Now, the Newton-Raphson formula is x_{n+1} = x_n - f(x_n)/f'(x_n). I need to find an initial guess, x₀, and then iterate until I get close enough to the root. But what's a good initial guess here? Let me think about the behavior of the function. 

When x is 0: 2*(0)^3 + e^0 = 0 + 1 = 1, which is less than 10. At x=1: 2*1 + e^1 ≈ 2 + 2.718 ≈ 4.718 <10. At x=2: 2*8 + e² ≈16 +7.389≈23.389>10. So the root is between 1 and 2. Maybe x₀=1.5? Let's check x=1.5: 2*(3.375)=6.75, e^1.5≈4.481, so 6.75+4.481≈11.231>10. So between 1 and 1.5. Let's try x=1.2: 2*(1.728)=3.456, e^1.2≈3.32, so total ≈6.776 <10. So the root is between 1.2 and 1.5. Maybe start with x₀=1.4.

Wait, let me check x=1.4: 2*(2.744)=5.488, e^1.4≈4.055, sum≈9.543 <10. Close. Next, x=1.45: 2*(1.45)^3. Let's compute 1.45^3. 1.45*1.45=2.1025, then *1.45≈3.0506. So 2*3.0506≈6.101. e^1.45≈4.26, sum≈6.101+4.26=10.361>10. So the root is between 1.4 and 1.45.

So maybe start with x₀=1.4. Let's compute f(1.4) and f'(1.4). 

f(x)=2x³ + e^x -10. So f(1.4)=2*(2.744) + e^1.4 -10 ≈5.488 +4.055 -10≈9.543 -10= -0.457.

f'(x) is the derivative: 6x² + e^x. At x=1.4, f'(1.4)=6*(1.96) + e^1.4≈11.76 +4.055≈15.815.

Now, Newton-Raphson step: x₁ = x₀ - f(x₀)/f'(x₀) = 1.4 - (-0.457)/15.815 ≈1.4 + 0.0289≈1.4289.

So x₁≈1.4289. Now compute f(x₁). Let's compute 2*(1.4289)^3 + e^1.4289.

First, 1.4289^3: Let's approximate. 1.4^3=2.744, 1.42^3≈1.42*1.42=2.0164, then *1.42 ≈2.863. Hmm, but 1.4289 is a bit higher. Alternatively, maybe compute 1.4289^3 as (1.4)^3 + 0.0289*(3*(1.4)^2) + ... Hmm, maybe better to just compute it step by step.

1.4289 * 1.4289 = let's calculate 1.4289^2. 1.4^2=1.96, 0.0289^2 is negligible, but cross terms: 2*1.4*0.0289≈0.0809. So approx 1.96+0.0809≈2.0409. Now, 2.0409 *1.4289. Let me compute 2*1.4289=2.8578, 0.0409*1.4289≈0.0584. So total approx 2.8578 +0.0584≈2.9162. So 1.4289^3≈2.9162. So 2x³≈5.8324.

Now e^1.4289: e^1.4 is about 4.055, e^0.0289≈1 +0.0289 + (0.0289)^2/2 ≈1.0289 +0.000418≈1.0293. So e^1.4289≈4.055 *1.0293≈4.174. So total f(x₁)=5.8324 +4.174 -10≈10.0064 -10≈0.0064. So f(x₁)≈0.0064, which is very close to zero.

Wait, but wait, 5.8324 +4.174 is 10.0064, so f(x₁)=0.0064. That's very close to zero. So the next step would give a better approximation. Let's compute f'(x₁)=6x² +e^x at x=1.4289. 

x²= (1.4289)^2≈2.0409, so 6x²≈12.245. e^1.4289≈4.174. So f'(x₁)=12.245 +4.174≈16.419.

Now, next iteration: x₂ = x₁ - f(x₁)/f'(x₁) ≈1.4289 - 0.0064/16.419 ≈1.4289 - 0.00039≈1.4285.

So x₂≈1.4285. Let me check f(1.4285). 2x³: x=1.4285, so x³≈(1.4285)^3. Let me approximate. Since 1.4289^3≈2.9162, so 1.4285^3 would be slightly less, maybe 2.913. So 2x³≈5.826. e^1.4285≈e^1.4289 - a tiny bit, so about 4.174 minus a little. Let's say approximately 4.173.

So f(x₂)=5.826 +4.173 -10≈9.999 -10≈-0.001. Hmm, but wait, maybe I'm getting close enough. Alternatively, perhaps I should take another iteration, but maybe the root is around 1.428.

Looking back at the options, the choices are A:3.14, B:2.05, C:2.89, D:-1.23, E:2.56, F:1.42, G:0.98, H:0.75, I:1.85, J:3.67.

So the closest to 1.428 is option F:1.42.

The equation \(2x^3 + e^x = 10\) is rearranged as \(f(x) = 2x^3 + e^x - 10\). Using the Newton-Raphson method, the root is sought between 1 and 2. Starting with an initial guess \(x_0 = 1.4\), the method converges to approximately \(x \approx 1.428\). Among the given options, the closest value is **1.42**.
