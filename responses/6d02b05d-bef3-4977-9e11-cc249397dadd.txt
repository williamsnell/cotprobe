Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the acceleration of a helicopter at a specific time. The height of the helicopter is given by the function s(t) = 300t - 4t³. I'm supposed to find the acceleration at t = 5 minutes, and the answer should be in meters per minute squared. The options are from A to J, so I'll need to compute and choose the correct one.

First, I remember that acceleration is the second derivative of the position function with respect to time. So, I'll need to find the first derivative, which gives velocity, and then take the derivative of that to get acceleration.

Let me start by finding the first derivative of s(t). The function is 300t minus 4t cubed. The derivative of 300t with respect to t is 300, right? Because the derivative of any linear term at is just a. Now, for the second term, -4t³, the derivative is calculated by bringing down the exponent as a coefficient and reducing the exponent by one. So, 3 times -4 is -12, and then t^(3-1) is t squared. So the first derivative, which is the velocity function v(t), should be 300 minus 12t squared.

Wait, no, wait a second. Let me double-check that. The derivative of -4t³ is indeed -12t² because 3 times 4 is 12, and the negative sign stays. So yes, v(t) = 300 - 12t².

Now, acceleration is the derivative of velocity, so I need to find the second derivative a(t). Taking the derivative of v(t) = 300 - 12t². The derivative of 300 is 0 because it's a constant. The derivative of -12t² is -24t, because you bring down the 2 as a coefficient, so 2 times -12 is -24, and the exponent becomes 1, so t. So the acceleration function a(t) is -24t.

Wait, that seems right. Let me make sure. Yes, because the derivative of t² is 2t, so when multiplied by -12, that's -24t.

Now, I need to find the acceleration at t = 5 minutes. So substitute t = 5 into a(t). So a(5) = -24 * 5. Let me calculate that. 24 times 5 is 120, so with the negative sign, it's -120.

Looking at the options, option H is -120. So the acceleration at t=5 is -120 m/min².

Wait, did I make any mistakes here? Let me go through the steps again. The position function is s(t) = 300t -4t³. First derivative: 300 -12t². Second derivative: -24t. At t=5, that's -24*5 = -120. Yep, that seems correct. So the answer should be H.

The acceleration is found by taking the second derivative of the position function s(t). The second derivative is -24t, and substituting t=5 gives -120 m/min².

Answer: H
