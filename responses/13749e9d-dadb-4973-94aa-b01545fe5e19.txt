Okay, so I've got this problem about cooling a plate with an air stream. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my heat transfer, but I'll do my best.

First, the problem states that the air is moving at 655 ft/sec. The plate is 1 inch long, and the static temperature is 65°F. There are two parts: part (a) is about finding the adiabatic wall temperature when the surface temperature is 95°F, and part (b) is calculating the heat transfer rate when the surface is 300°F.

Hmm, I'm a bit confused about what exactly is being asked. For part (a), adiabatic wall temperature... Wait, isn't the adiabatic wall temperature the temperature of the surface when it's perfectly insulated, meaning no heat is transferred? So if the surface is at 95°F, and the air is moving, is the adiabatic temperature the same as the surface temperature here? Or is it different? Maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, no, I think the adiabatic wall temperature refers to the temperature the surface would reach if it were adiabatic, meaning it's in equilibrium with the flow. So maybe it's the stagnation temperature? Because stagnation temperature is the temperature the gas would have if it were brought to rest adiabatically. Oh, right, stagnation temperature is important in high-speed flows because the temperature changes when the flow is decelerated.

So for part (a), the surface is at 95°F, but the plate is being cooled by the air. So the adiabatic wall temperature would be related to the stagnation temperature of the incoming air. Let me recall the formula for stagnation temperature.

The stagnation temperature, T0, is given by T0 = T + (V^2)/(2*c_p), where V is the velocity, and c_p is the specific heat at constant pressure. But wait, the units here are in Fahrenheit, which complicates things because I usually work in Kelvin or Celsius. Also, velocity is in ft/sec, so I need to make sure the units are consistent.

Wait, but maybe I can find the stagnation temperature in Fahrenheit. Alternatively, perhaps I can convert everything to Rankine since Fahrenheit can be tricky. Let me think. Wait, no, maybe I can just use the formula directly in Fahrenheit, considering that the specific heat is in BTU units.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the stagnation temperature in terms of static temperature. The static temperature is given as 65°F. So, T = 65°F, V = 655 ft/s.

But to calculate the stagnation temperature, I need to use the formula T0 = T + (V^2)/(2*c_p). But I'm not sure about the value of c_p for air in these units. I remember that for air, c_p is approximately 0.24 BTU/lb·°F. Wait, but sometimes it's given as 0.24 BTU/(lb·°R) since it's the same in Fahrenheit and Rankine because they're linear scales.

Wait, but I'm not certain. Let me think: c_p for air is around 0.24 BTU/(lb·°F), yes. So, using that, I can compute the stagnation temperature.

So, V = 655 ft/s. Let me compute V squared: 655^2 = let's see, 600^2 is 360,000, 55^2 is 3,025. So 655^2 is (600+55)^2 = 600^2 + 2*600*55 +55^2 = 360,000 + 66,000 + 3,025 = 429,025 ft²/s².

But wait, the units for c_p are in BTU/(lb·°F), so I need to convert the velocity term into units that match. Let me see, the formula is T0 = T + (V^2)/(2*c_p). But V is in ft/s, so V² is (ft²/s²). To convert that into energy per mass, I think I need to use the conversion factor from (ft/s)^2 to BTU/lb. I remember that 1 BTU is approximately 778 ft·lb. So, let's see:

The term (V^2)/(2*c_p) would be (ft²/s²) divided by (BTU/(lb·°F)). Wait, that would give (ft²/s² * lb·°F) / BTU. That seems a bit off. Maybe I should approach this differently.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the conversion that 1 BTU = 25037 ft²·lb/s². Wait, that might help. Because then, c_p is in BTU/(lb·°F), which is equivalent to (ft²·lb/s²)/(lb·°F) ) = ft²/(s²·°F). Hmm, maybe I can rearrange.

Wait, perhaps I should first compute the kinetic energy per unit mass and then convert it into temperature rise.

So, kinetic energy per unit mass is (V^2)/2, which is (655)^2 / 2 = 429,025 / 2 = 214,512.5 (ft²/s²). Now, to convert ft²/s² into BTU/lb, I need to use the conversion factor between ft·lb and BTU. Since 1 BTU ≈ 778 ft·lb, then 1 ft·lb = 1/778 BTU.

But wait, ft²/s² is a unit of energy per mass. Let me see: energy is in ft·lb, so (ft²/s²) * lb = ft·lb·s^-2, which is force times velocity, which is power. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the relation that the kinetic energy in BTU per pound is (V^2)/(2*gc*778), where gc is the conversion factor from English to SI units, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I should look up the formula for stagnation temperature in English units. I think the formula is T0 = T + (V^2)/(2*c_p*R*T), but wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again.

Wait, I think the correct formula is T0 = T + (V^2)/(2*c_p), where c_p is in consistent units. But I'm not getting the units right. Let me try plugging in the numbers.

If T is 65°F, V is 655 ft/s, and c_p is 0.24 BTU/(lb·°F), then:

(V²)/(2*c_p) = (655^2) / (2 * 0.24). Let's compute that:

655^2 = 429,025.

So 429,025 / (2 * 0.24) = 429,025 / 0.48 ≈ 893,802.0833.

But what are the units here? Let me see: 655 ft/s squared is (ft²/s²), and 0.24 is BTU/(lb·°F). So the units would be (ft²/s²) / (BTU/(lb·°F)) ) = (ft²/s² * lb·°F) / BTU. That's not matching, so I must have made a mistake.

Wait, maybe I should convert the velocity into something else. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula in terms of the specific heat in different units. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: The stagnation temperature increase due to velocity can be calculated using the formula:

ΔT = V^2 / (2 * c_p * 5703)

Where 5703 is the conversion factor from (ft/s)^2 to BTU/lb. Because 1 BTU ≈ 778 ft·lb, and 1 lb·ft = 1 ft·lb, so 778 ft·lb = 1 BTU. So, to convert (ft/s)^2 to BTU/lb, we can use 1 BTU = 778 ft·lb, so 1 ft^2/s^2 = 1/(778) ft·lb/s^2. But I'm not sure if that's the right approach.

Wait, perhaps it's better to use the formula:

T0 = T + (V^2)/(2 * c_p * 5703)

Where 5703 is the conversion factor from (ft/s)^2 to BTU/lb. Let me check that. So 5703 comes from (1 BTU) / ( (1 lb) * (1 ft/s)^2 * something )? Maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the following approach:

The kinetic energy per unit mass is (V^2)/2 (in ft²/s²). To convert this to BTU/lb, I can use the conversion factor 1 BTU = 778 ft·lb. So, 1 ft²/s² = 1 ft·lb/(lb·s²). Wait, that doesn't make sense. Let me think again.

Wait, I think the correct formula is:

T0 = T + (V^2)/(2 * c_p * (25037))

Where 25037 is the conversion factor from (ft/s)^2 to BTU/lb. Because 1 BTU ≈ 25037 ft²/s². So, 1 ft²/s² = 1/25037 BTU/lb.

So, using that, the formula becomes:

T0 = T + (V^2) / (2 * c_p * 25037)

Let me plug in the numbers:

V = 655 ft/s, T = 65°F, c_p = 0.24 BTU/(lb·°F)

Compute V² = 655^2 = 429,025 ft²/s².

So, (429,025) / (2 * 0.24 * 25037) = 429025 / (2 * 0.24 * 25037)

Let me compute the denominator first: 2 * 0.24 = 0.48; 0.48 * 25037 ≈ 12,017.76

So, 429,025 / 12,017.76 ≈ 35.72 °F.

So, the stagnation temperature T0 = 65 + 35.72 ≈ 100.72°F.

Wait, but that's part (a). The surface temperature is 95°F, but the adiabatic wall temperature would be the stagnation temperature, which is higher than the static temperature. So in this case, the surface is at 95°F, but the adiabatic temperature is around 100.7°F, which would be higher than the surface temperature. But the surface is cooler than the adiabatic temperature, which doesn't make sense because if the plate is cooler than the surrounding air, heat should be transferred from the plate to the air, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Wait, the plate is being cooled by the air stream. So the plate's surface is at 95°F, and the air is at 65°F static temperature. So, the plate is hotter than the air, so heat should flow from the plate to the air.

But the adiabatic wall temperature is the temperature the plate would reach if it were adiabatic, meaning no heat transfer. So in that case, the plate's temperature would be equal to the stagnation temperature of the incoming air, which we calculated as about 100.7°F. But wait, that's higher than the plate's surface temperature of 95°F. That can't be right because if the plate is at 95°F, and the adiabatic temp is 100.7°F, then the plate would actually be cooler than the adiabatic temp, which would imply that heat is being transferred from the plate to the air, which is possible.

Wait, but in the case of adiabatic walls, the plate's temperature would be higher than the incoming air's stagnation temperature if it's being heated. But in this case, the plate is being cooled, so perhaps the adiabatic temp is lower. Hmm, I'm getting confused.

Wait, maybe I should think differently. The adiabatic wall temperature is the temperature that the wall would reach if it were perfectly insulated, meaning no heat transfer occurs. In that case, the wall's temperature would be equal to the stagnation temperature of the incoming air. So, in this problem, the plate is at 95°F, which is lower than the adiabatic temp of about 100.7°F. So, that would mean that the plate is below the adiabatic temperature, so heat would flow from the plate to the air, which would cool the plate further. But that's not possible because the plate is at 95°F, and the adiabatic temp is higher. Wait, no, if the plate is at 95°F and the adiabatic temp is 100.7°F, then the plate would actually be cooler than the adiabatic temp, which suggests that heat would flow from the plate to the air, causing the plate's temperature to increase towards the adiabatic temp. But that's not the case here because the plate is being cooled. I must have messed up the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recalculate the stagnation temperature.

Compute V² = 655^2 = 429,025.

Then, 429,025 divided by (2 * 0.24 * 25037)

Wait, 2*0.24 is 0.48, 0.48 * 25037 is about 12,017.76.

So 429,025 / 12,017.76 ≈ 35.72.

So T0 = 65 + 35.72 ≈ 100.72°F.

Hmm, that seems correct. So the adiabatic wall temp would be about 100.7°F. But the plate's surface is at 95°F, which is lower. So that implies that the plate is cooler than the adiabatic temp, so heat would flow from the plate to the air, which would increase the plate's temp towards 100.7°F. But the plate is being cooled, which would require that the plate's temp is higher than the adiabatic temp, so heat can flow from the plate to the air, cooling the plate. Wait, maybe I'm getting this backwards.

Wait, no. If the plate is at a higher temperature than the surrounding fluid, heat will flow from the plate to the fluid, cooling the plate. So if the plate's surface temp is 95°F, and the fluid's stagnation temp is 100.7°F, then the plate is cooler than the fluid, which would mean heat flows from the fluid to the plate, heating the plate. But that's the opposite of what's happening here, because the plate is being cooled by the air stream.

I think I'm getting confused here. Maybe I should approach this differently. Let's consider that the plate is being cooled by the air, so the plate's surface is at 95°F, and the air is at 65°F static temp. The adiabatic wall temp would be the temp the plate would reach if it were adiabatic, which in this case, since the plate is being cooled, perhaps the adiabatic temp is lower than the plate's current temp. Wait, that doesn't make sense because if the plate is adiabatic, it can't exchange heat, so its temp would remain at whatever it is. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up concepts. The adiabatic wall temp is the temp that the wall would have if it were perfectly insulated, meaning no heat transfer occurs between the wall and the fluid. So, in that scenario, the wall's temp would be equal to the fluid's stagnation temp. So in this problem, the plate is at 95°F, and the fluid's stagnation temp is 100.7°F. So the plate's adiabatic temp would be 100.7°F, which is higher than its current temp of 95°F. But that suggests that the plate is cooler than the adiabatic temp, so heat would flow from the plate to the fluid, but that would require the plate to be at a higher temp than the fluid, which it isn't. So this seems contradictory.

Alternatively, perhaps the adiabatic wall temp is the temp the plate would reach if it were adiabatic, which in this case, since the plate is being cooled, the adiabatic temp would be lower than the plate's current temp. But that doesn't make sense because if the plate is adiabatic, it can't lose heat, so its temp would be higher than the fluid's.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's approach part (a) first. The question is, given a surface temp of 95°F, calculate the adiabatic wall temp. So perhaps the adiabatic wall temp is the same as the surface temp in this case. But that doesn't make sense because adiabatic implies no heat transfer, so the wall's temp would be the same as the incoming fluid's stagnation temp.

Wait, but in this scenario, the plate is being cooled by the air, so the plate's surface temp is 95°F, which is lower than the static air temp of 65°F. Wait, no, 95 is higher than 65. So the plate is hotter than the air, so heat would flow from the plate to the air, cooling the plate.

But the adiabatic wall temp is the temp the plate would reach if it were adiabatic, meaning no heat transfer. So in that case, the plate's temp would be equal to the incoming air's stagnation temp, which we calculated as about 100.7°F. So the answer for part (a) would be 100.7°F, which is approximately 100°F when rounded.

Looking at the options, option B says 100°F, and the heat transfer rate is 10,000 Btu/hr-ft². Option A says 95°F, which is the surface temp, but that's not the adiabatic temp. So part (a)'s answer would be 100°F.

Now, part (b) is about calculating the rate of heat transfer when the surface temp is 300°F. So, the plate's surface is at 300°F, and the air is at 65°F static temp. The plate's length is 1 inch. Wait, but for heat transfer, I think we need to consider the convective heat transfer coefficient.

Wait, but the problem doesn't provide any information about the convective coefficient. Hmm. Maybe I need to calculate it using some formula. Oh, perhaps we can use the Dittus-Boelter equation for convective heat transfer in turbulent flow.

The Dittus-Boelter equation is Nu = 0.023 * Re^(0.8) * Pr^(1/3), where Re is the Reynolds number and Pr is the Prandtl number.

First, I need to calculate the Reynolds number. Reynolds number Re = (V * L) / ν, where L is the length of the plate, V is the velocity, and ν is the kinematic viscosity.

But the plate's length is given as 1 inch, which is 1/12 ft. So L = 1/12 ft.

V is 655 ft/s.

ν for air can be calculated using the ideal gas law: ν = R*T/ρ, where R is the specific gas constant for air, T is the static temp in Rankine, and ρ is the density.

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to find ν at 65°F. At standard conditions, air at 60°F has a kinematic viscosity of approximately 1.5e-4 ft²/s. Let me check: at 65°F, which is slightly higher than 60°F, ν would be a bit lower, maybe around 1.4e-4 ft²/s. Alternatively, I can calculate it.

The dynamic viscosity μ for air can be approximated using the formula μ = 0.00001782 * (T/100)^1.5 lb·s/ft², where T is in °F. Wait, is that correct? Or perhaps it's better to use Sutherland's formula.

Sutherland's formula for dynamic viscosity μ is:

μ = (0.01788 c_p * T^(3/2)) / (T + 198.6)

Where c_p is in BTU/(lb·°F), T is in °F.

Wait, but this might get complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can look up the kinematic viscosity at 65°F. I think at 65°F, ν is approximately 1.44e-4 ft²/s.

Wait, let me confirm: at 60°F, ν is about 1.47e-4 ft²/s. At 70°F, it's about 1.39e-4. So at 65°F, it's roughly 1.44e-4 ft²/s.

So, Re = (V * L) / ν = (655 ft/s * 1/12 ft) / (1.44e-4 ft²/s)

Calculate numerator: 655 * (1/12) ≈ 54.583 ft²/s.

So Re = 54.583 / 1.44e-4 ≈ 54.583 / 0.000144 ≈ 379,000.

That's a high Reynolds number, so the flow is definitely turbulent.

Next, the Prandtl number for air is approximately 0.72.

So, using Dittus-Boelter: Nu = 0.023 * (Re)^0.8 * (Pr)^(1/3)

Compute Re^0.8: 379,000^0.8.

Let me compute ln(379,000) ≈ 12.845. Multiply by 0.8: 10.276. Exponentiate: e^10.276 ≈ 25,000 (exact value might be a bit off, but for estimation, let's say about 25,000).

Pr^1/3 = 0.72^(1/3) ≈ 0.896.

So Nu ≈ 0.023 * 25,000 * 0.896 ≈ 0.023 * 22,400 ≈ 515.2.

So, the Nusselt number is approximately 515.

Then, the convective heat transfer coefficient h is given by h = Nu * ν / L.

Wait, no, wait: h = Nu * (k), where k is the thermal conductivity. Alternatively, h = Nu * (k/L), but I think I'm mixing up formulas.

Wait, no, the correct formula is h = Nu * (k), but k can also be expressed in terms of ν and c_p. Since k = c_p * ν, then h = Nu * c_p * ν.

Wait, let me check: For Dittus-Boelter, h = Nu * (k), and k = c_p * ν. So h = Nu * c_p * ν.

But I need to ensure the units are consistent.

c_p for air is approximately 0.24 BTU/(lb·°F). ν is 1.44e-4 ft²/s.

So h = 515 * 0.24 * 1.44e-4.

Compute 515 * 0.24 = 123.6.

Then, 123.6 * 1.44e-4 = 123.6 * 0.000144 ≈ 0.01785 BTU/(hr·ft²·°F). Wait, no, that can't be right because the units don't make sense. Wait, let me check the units again. Wait, no, the units for h should be BTU/(hr·ft²·°F), but I think I messed up the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate h in different units. Let's compute it step by step.

h = Nu * c_p * ν.

Nu = 515 (dimensionless)

c_p = 0.24 BTU/(lb·°F)

ν = 1.44e-4 ft²/s.

So, h = 515 * 0.24 * 1.44e-4 (BTU/(lb·°F)) * (ft²/s)

But to convert this into BTU/(hr·ft²·°F), I need to convert seconds to hours.

So, 1 hour = 3600 seconds.

So, h = 515 * 0.24 * 1.44e-4 * 3600 (since ft²/s * s/hour = ft²/hour)

Wait, no, perhaps better to compute:

h = 515 * 0.24 * 1.44e-4 * 3600.

Let me compute that:

First, 515 * 0.24 = 123.6.

123.6 * 1.44e-4 = 123.6 * 0.000144 ≈ 0.01785.

Then, 0.01785 * 3600 ≈ 64.26.

So, h ≈ 64.26 BTU/(hr·ft²·°F).

Wait, that seems a bit low. Let me check the steps again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me redo it.

h = Nu * c_p * ν * (3600/(1))

Because ν is in ft²/s, and we want h in BTU/(hr·ft²·°F), so we multiply by 3600 to convert seconds to hours.

So, h = 515 * 0.24 * 1.44e-4 * 3600.

Compute step by step:

515 * 0.24 = 123.6.

123.6 * 1.44e-4 = 123.6 * 0.000144 = 0.01785.

0.01785 * 3600 ≈ 64.26.

So, h ≈ 64.26 BTU/(hr·ft²·°F).

Now, the heat transfer rate per unit area (q) is given by Newton's law of cooling: q = h * (T_s - T_ambient).

T_s is the surface temp, which is 300°F, and T_ambient is the static temp of the air, 65°F.

So, T_s - T_ambient = 300 - 65 = 235°F.

Thus, q = 64.26 * 235 ≈ ?

Compute 64.26 * 200 = 12,852.

64.26 * 35 ≈ 2,249.1.

Total ≈ 12,852 + 2,249.1 ≈ 15,101.1 BTU/hr·ft².

Looking at the options, option C is 15,000 BTU/hr·ft², which is close to this value. But wait, part (a) had the adiabatic temp as 100°F, which would correspond to option B for part (a), but the heat transfer rate is part (b)'s answer.

Wait, but the options are given as (a) and (b) in the same options. Let me look again.

The options are:

A: 95°F, 12,361 Btu/hr-ft²

B: 100°F, 10,000 Btu/hr-ft²

C: 90°F, 15,000 Btu/hr-ft²

D: 85°F, 13,000 Btu/hr-ft²

Wait, but the way the options are structured, each option seems to provide both the adiabatic temp and the heat transfer rate. But the problem has two parts: (a) asks for adiabatic temp when surface is 95°F, and (b) asks for heat transfer rate when surface is 300°F.

So, the correct answer for part (a) is 100°F, and for part (b) it's approximately 15,100 Btu/hr·ft², which is closest to option C's 15,000.

But wait, option C says 90°F for the adiabatic temp, which contradicts our earlier calculation of 100°F. So perhaps the options are for each part separately, but the way the options are presented is unclear. Alternatively, perhaps each option combines the two parts, but that doesn't make sense because part (a) is about 95°F surface, and part (b) is about 300°F surface.

Wait, perhaps each option is a possible answer for both parts, but that's not clear. Alternatively, perhaps the options are for part (b) only, but the way the question is phrased is a bit confusing.

Wait, the question says: "Considering (a) a surface temperature of 95°F, calculate the adiabatic wall temperature (b) a surface temperature of 300°F, calculate the rate of heat transfer at the plate."

So, perhaps each option provides both answers, but that would mean that for each option, the first part is the adiabatic temp for (a), and the second part is the heat transfer rate for (b).

But that would mean that we need to find an option where the adiabatic temp is 100°F and the heat rate is ~15,000 Btu/hr·ft². Looking at the options, option C has 15,000 Btu/hr·ft² but the adiabatic temp is 90°F, which doesn't match. Similarly, option B has 100°F but the heat rate is 10,000, which is lower than our calculation.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating h. Let me double-check the steps.

Reynolds number: V = 655 ft/s, L = 1/12 ft, ν = 1.44e-4 ft²/s.

Re = (655 * 1/12) / 1.44e-4 = (54.583) / 0.000144 ≈ 379,000. Correct.

Pr = 0.72. Correct.

Nu = 0.023 * (379000)^0.8 * (0.72)^(1/3).

Compute (379,000)^0.8:

Take natural log: ln(379,000) ≈ 12.845.

Multiply by 0.8: 10.276.

Exponentiate: e^10.276 ≈ 25,000.

(0.72)^(1/3) ≈ 0.896.

So Nu ≈ 0.023 * 25,000 * 0.896 ≈ 0.023 * 22,400 ≈ 515.2.

Correct.

h = Nu * c_p * ν * 3600.

c_p = 0.24 BTU/(lb·°F).

ν = 1.44e-4 ft²/s.

So, h = 515.2 * 0.24 * 1.44e-4 * 3600.

Compute 515.2 * 0.24 = 123.648.

123.648 * 1.44e-4 = 123.648 * 0.000144 ≈ 0.01786.

0.01786 * 3600 ≈ 64.296 BTU/(hr·ft²·°F).

Then, q = h * (300 - 65) = 64.296 * 235 ≈ 15,130 Btu/hr·ft².

So, the closest option for the heat transfer rate is option C's 15,000 Btu/hr·ft², but the adiabatic temp for part (a) is 100°F, which is option B's adiabatic temp, but option B's heat rate is 10,000, which doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the adiabatic temp. Let me recheck that.

Earlier, I calculated the stagnation temp as T0 = T + V²/(2*c_p*25037).

Wait, 25037 is the conversion factor from (ft/s)^2 to BTU/lb. So, 25037 ft²/s² = 1 BTU/lb.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the formula for stagnation temperature. The correct formula is T0 = T + (V^2)/(2 * c_p * 25037), where c_p is in BTU/(lb·°R).

But I think I might have used the wrong formula. Let me look it up.

Wait, the correct formula for stagnation temperature in English units is:

T0 = T + (V^2)/(2 * c_p * 25037)

Where c_p is in BTU/(lb·°R), which is the same as BTU/(lb·°F) because the size of the degree is the same.

So, using c_p = 0.24 BTU/(lb·°F), V = 655 ft/s, T = 65°F.

Compute V² = 655^2 = 429,025.

Then, V²/(2 * c_p * 25037) = 429025 / (2 * 0.24 * 25037) = 429025 / (12,017.76) ≈ 35.72.

So, T0 = 65 + 35.72 ≈ 100.72°F, which is about 100.7°F. So, the adiabatic temp is approximately 100.7°F, which would round to 100°F, matching option B's adiabatic temp.

But the heat transfer rate for part (b) is around 15,130 Btu/hr·ft², which is closest to option C's 15,000 Btu/hr·ft². But option C's adiabatic temp is 90°F, which doesn't match our calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of h. Let me check again.

h = 515.2 * 0.24 * 1.44e-4 * 3600.

Wait, 515.2 * 0.24 = 123.648.

123.648 * 1.44e-4 = 0.01786.

0.01786 * 3600 = 64.296.

Yes, that's correct.

q = 64.296 * (300 - 65) = 64.296 * 235 ≈ 15,130.

So, the closest option is C: 15,000 Btu/hr·ft², but its adiabatic temp is 90°F, which is incorrect. Similarly, option B has the correct adiabatic temp but the wrong heat rate.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of h. Maybe I should use a different approach. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use a different method, like assuming the flow is laminar, but that would give a lower Re and a lower h, which would result in a lower heat transfer rate. But the Re we calculated was 379,000, which is well into the turbulent flow regime, so the Dittus-Boelter equation is appropriate.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the Reynolds number in the laminar range, but that's unlikely given the high velocity and short length.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the plate's length is 1 inch, which is 0.0833 feet. Wait, no, 1 inch is 1/12 feet, which is approximately 0.0833 feet. So, using that, Re = (655 * 0.0833) / ν.

Wait, but I did that correctly earlier. 655 * (1/12) ≈ 54.583, and ν is 1.44e-4, so Re is 54.583 / 0.000144 ≈ 379,000.

Yes, that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use a different method for part (b), such as using the thermal conductivity directly without calculating h. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the problem is only asking for part (a) and part (b) separately, and the options are for each part individually. So, for part (a), the adiabatic temp is 100°F, which is option B's first part. For part (b), the heat rate is approximately 15,130, which is closest to option C's second part.

But the options are structured as single answers, not separate for each part. So perhaps the correct option is the one that combines the correct adiabatic temp and heat rate.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of h. Let me try using a different approach.

Another formula for h in turbulent flow is h = 0.023 * (Re - 1000)^(0.8) * Pr^(1/3) * c_p * ν * 3600.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the Colburn factor, which is similar to the Dittus-Boelter equation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the approximation that for air, the convective coefficient can be approximated as h ≈ 0.0175 * V * c_p.

Wait, let me try that. V is 655 ft/s, c_p is 0.24 BTU/(lb·°F).

So, h ≈ 0.0175 * 655 * 0.24.

0.0175 * 655 ≈ 11.6125.

11.6125 * 0.24 ≈ 2.787 BTU/(hr·ft²·°F).

Wait, that's way lower than what I calculated earlier. That can't be right because the Dittus-Boelter gave a much higher h.

Hmm, perhaps that approximation is only valid under certain conditions. I think the Dittus-Boelter approach is more accurate here.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem expects me to use the formula for heat transfer rate without calculating h, perhaps using the Nusselt number directly. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the formula q = (V * c_p * (T_s - T_ambient)) / (L), but I'm not certain.

Wait, let me think: the mass flow rate is (density * velocity * area). But without knowing the area, it's hard to proceed. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula for heat transfer per unit area, which is h * (T_s - T_ambient).

But I think my earlier approach is correct, leading to a heat transfer rate of approximately 15,130 Btu/hr·ft², which is closest to option C's 15,000 Btu/hr·ft², but that option has the adiabatic temp as 90°F, which is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the adiabatic temp is not needed for part (b), and the options are structured differently. Maybe each option is for part (b), with the first part being the adiabatic temp from part (a). But that's unclear.

Wait, perhaps the options are for each part separately. So, for part (a), the correct answer is 100°F, which is option B's first value. For part (b), the correct answer is approximately 15,130 Btu/hr·ft², which is closest to option C's second value.

But the options are presented as A through J, each providing both adiabatic temp and heat rate, so perhaps the correct option combines both correct answers, but none of the options do that. Alternatively, perhaps the question is only asking for part (a) or part (b), but the way it's phrased is unclear.

Wait, the question says: "calculate the adiabatic wall temperature (a)" and "calculate the rate of heat transfer at the plate (b)". So perhaps the options are for each part individually, but the way they are presented is unclear.

Assuming that, for part (a), the adiabatic temp is 100°F, which is option B's first value. For part (b), the heat rate is ~15,130, which is closest to option C's second value.

But since the options are combined, perhaps the intended answer is option B for part (a) and option C for part (b), but that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the heat transfer rate. Let me try a different approach.

Another formula for heat transfer rate is q = (m_dot) * c_p * (T_s - T_ambient).

But I need to find m_dot, the mass flow rate. m_dot = density * velocity * area.

But without the area, I can't compute m_dot. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering heat transfer per unit length or per unit area.

Wait, the plate length is 1 inch, which is 1/12 ft. So, perhaps the area is length times width, but without the width, I can't compute the area. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is assuming a unit width, so the area is length * 1 ft.

In that case, the area A = (1/12) ft * 1 ft = 1/12 ft².

Then, m_dot = density * velocity * A.

Density ρ can be found from the ideal gas law: ρ = P/(R*T), but without pressure, it's hard to find. Alternatively, perhaps we can assume standard atmospheric pressure, but without that, it's unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps we can estimate the density using the specific volume. Specific volume v = 1/ρ. For air, at 65°F and 1 atm, the specific volume is about 13.97 ft³/lb.

So, density ρ = 1/13.97 ≈ 0.0716 lb/ft³.

Then, m_dot = ρ * V * A.

V is 655 ft/s, A is 1/12 ft².

So, m_dot = 0.0716 lb/ft³ * 655 ft/s * (1/12) ft².

Compute:

0.0716 * 655 ≈ 47.014.

47.014 * (1/12) ≈ 3.918 lb/s.

Then, q = m_dot * c_p * (T_s - T_ambient) = 3.918 lb/s * 0.24 BTU/lb·°F * (300 - 65)°F.

Compute:

3.918 * 0.24 ≈ 0.94032 BTU/s·°F.

0.94032 * 235 ≈ 221.37 BTU/s.

Convert to BTU/hr: 221.37 * 3600 ≈ 800,532 BTU/hr.

But that's the total heat transfer rate, not per unit area. To find q per ft², divide by the area (1/12 ft²):

q = 800,532 / (1/12) ≈ 9,606,384 BTU/hr·ft², which is way too high. That can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Maybe I should use the convective coefficient h and calculate q per unit area instead.

As earlier, h ≈ 64.296 BTU/(hr·ft²·°F).

q = h * (T_s - T_ambient) = 64.296 * (300 - 65) ≈ 64.296 * 235 ≈ 15,130 BTU/hr·ft².

So, this aligns with the earlier calculation.

But looking back at the options, the only option with a heat rate close to this is option C: 15,000 Btu/hr·ft², but its adiabatic temp is 90°F, which is incorrect. Option B has the correct adiabatic temp but the wrong heat rate.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to use a different method for part (a). Let me think again.

In part (a), the surface temp is 95°F, and the plate is being cooled by the air. The adiabatic wall temp would be the stagnation temp of the incoming air, which we calculated as 100.7°F, so approximately 100°F, matching option B.

For part (b), the heat transfer rate is approximately 15,130 Btu/hr·ft², which is closest to option C's 15,000 Btu/hr·ft², but option C's adiabatic temp is 90°F, which is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the options are structured such that each option provides the answer for both parts, and the correct option is the one where part (a) is 100°F and part (b) is ~15,130. But none of the options match that exactly.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the adiabatic temp. Let me recalculate that.

T0 = T + V²/(2*c_p*25037)

V=655, T=65, c_p=0.24.

V²=429,025.

Denominator: 2 * 0.24 * 25037 = 0.48 * 25037 ≈ 12,017.76.

So, V²/(denominator) = 429,025 / 12,017.76 ≈ 35.72.

So, T0 = 65 + 35.72 ≈ 100.72°F.

Yes, that's correct. So, the adiabatic temp is 100.7°F, which is closest to option B's 100°F.

Thus, the correct answer for part (a) is 100°F, and for part (b) it's approximately 15,130 Btu/hr·ft².

But since the options are combined, perhaps the intended answer is option B for part (a) and another option for part (b), but that's not clear.

Given the options, the closest match for part (a) is option B, and for part (b), option C. However, since the options are combined, perhaps the intended answer is option B for part (a), and the heat transfer rate is not critical in the options for part (a).

But the question is to select the answer for both parts, so perhaps the correct option is the one that includes the correct adiabatic temp and heat rate. Since none of the options do, perhaps the intended answer is option B for part (a), and for part (b), the closest is option C.

But since the options are given as a single choice, I think the intended answer is option B for part (a), but I'm not sure about part (b). Alternatively, perhaps the heat transfer rate calculation was incorrect, and the correct answer is option A or D.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I should use the formula for heat transfer rate as q = (V * c_p * (T_s - T_ambient)).

But that would be:

q = 655 ft/s * 0.24 BTU/(lb·°F) * (300 - 65)°F.

But that gives q in BTU/(s·lb), which isn't helpful without mass flow rate.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the mass flow rate as m_dot = (density) * V * A.

But without knowing the area, I can't proceed. Hmm.

I think I've spent enough time on this. The adiabatic temp for part (a) is 100°F, which is option B, and the heat transfer rate for part (b) is approximately 15,130, which is closest to option C's 15,000. But since the options are combined, perhaps the intended answer is option B for part (a) and option C for part (b), but that's not an option. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B for part (a), and the heat transfer rate is not as critical.

But given the options, the best fit for part (a) is option B, and for part (b), option C. However, since the options are combined, perhaps the answer intended is option B, considering part (a) is correct and part (b) is less critical. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in part (b).

Wait, perhaps the heat transfer rate should be calculated using the formula q = (m_dot) * c_p * (T_s - T_ambient).

But without m_dot, I can't proceed. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the formula q = (V * A) * c_p * (T_s - T_ambient), but that's not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the convective coefficient h and calculate q = h * (T_s - T_ambient) * A, but without A, I can't find q per unit area.

Wait, but earlier I calculated h as 64.296 BTU/(hr·ft²·°F), so q per unit area is h*(T_s - T_ambient) = 64.296 * 235 ≈ 15,130 BTU/hr·ft², which is what I did earlier.

So, the correct answer for part (a) is 100°F, and for part (b) it's ~15,130 Btu/hr·ft², which is closest to option C's 15,000, but option C's adiabatic temp is 90°F, which is incorrect.

Given this confusion, perhaps the intended answer is option B for part (a) and option C for part (b), but since the options are single choices, I'll have to choose the best fit.

But the options are A through D, each providing both adiabatic temp and heat rate. Since part (a) is about adiabatic temp and part (b) about heat rate, perhaps the correct option is the one where part (a) is 100°F and part (b) is ~15,130. But none of the options match that exactly.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is option B, which has the correct adiabatic temp for part (a), and the heat rate is 10,000, which is lower than my calculation. But I think my calculation is more accurate.

In conclusion, the correct answers are:

(a) Adiabatic temp: 100°F (option B's first value)

(b) Heat rate: ~15,130 Btu/hr·ft² (closest to option C's second value)

But since the options are combined, perhaps the intended answer is option B for part (a), and the heat rate is not as critical. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in part (b), and the correct answer is option A.

But given the time I've spent, I'll go with option B for part (a) and option C for part (b), but since that's not an option, I'll choose option B as the best fit.
</think>

The problem involves cooling a plate with an air stream moving at 655 ft/s, where the plate length is 1 inch and the static temperature is 65°F. Two parts are considered: (a) calculating the adiabatic wall temperature when the surface temperature is 95°F, and (b) calculating the heat transfer rate when the surface temperature is 300°F.

### Part (a): Adiabatic Wall Temperature
The adiabatic wall temperature is the stagnation temperature of the incoming air. Using the formula for stagnation temperature:

\[
T_0 = T + \frac{V^2}{2 \cdot c_p \cdot 25037}
\]

Where:
- \( T = 65°F \)
- \( V = 655 \, \text{ft/s} \)
- \( c_p = 0.24 \, \text{BTU/(lb·°F)} \)
- \( 25037 \, \text{ft}^2/\text{s}^2 = 1 \, \text{BTU/lb} \)

Calculating \( V^2 \):
\[
V^2 = 655^2 = 429,025 \, \text{ft}^2/\text{s}^2
\]

Substituting into the formula:
\[
\frac{V^2}{2 \cdot c_p \cdot 25037} = \frac{429,025}{2 \cdot 0.24 \cdot 25037} \approx 35.72°F
\]

\[
T_0 = 65 + 35.72 \approx 100.72°F \approx 100°F
\]

Thus, the adiabatic wall temperature is approximately **100°F**, matching **option B**.

### Part (b): Heat Transfer Rate
The heat transfer rate is calculated using Newton's law of cooling:
\[
q = h \cdot (T_s - T_{\text{ambient}})
\]

Where:
- \( T_s = 300°F \)
- \( T_{\text{ambient}} = 65°F \)
- \( h \) is the convective heat transfer coefficient.

Using the Dittus-Boelter equation for turbulent flow:
\[
\text{Nu} = 0.023 \cdot \text{Re}^{0.8} \cdot \text{Pr}^{1/3}
\]

Where:
- \( \text{Re} = \frac{V \cdot L}{\nu} \)
- \( L = \frac{1}{12} \, \text{ft} \)
- \( \nu = 1.44 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{ft}^2/\text{s} \)
- \( \text{Pr} = 0.72 \)

Calculating \( \text{Re} \):
\[
\text{Re} = \frac{655 \cdot \frac{1}{12}}{1.44 \times 10^{-4}} \approx 379,000
\]

Calculating \( \text{Nu} \):
\[
\text{Nu} = 0.023 \cdot (379,000)^{0.8} \cdot (0.72)^{1/3} \approx 515.2
\]

Calculating \( h \):
\[
h = \text{Nu} \cdot c_p \cdot \nu \cdot 3600 \approx 64.296 \, \text{BTU/(hr·ft}^2·°\text{F)}
\]

Finally, calculating \( q \):
\[
q = 64.296 \cdot (300 - 65) \approx 15,130 \, \text{BTU/hr·ft}^2
\]

The closest option for the heat transfer rate is **15,000 Btu/hr·ft²**, matching **option C**. However, option C's adiabatic temperature is incorrect, so the best fit for part (a) is **option B**.

### Final Answer:
**B** (100°F, 10,000 Btu/hr·ft²)

Answer: B
