Okay, so I have this question about stable isotopes and their use in measuring total body water. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that isotopes are variants of elements with different numbers of neutrons. Stable isotopes are those that don't decay into other elements over time. They're commonly used in various scientific measurements, including medical and nutritional fields.

The question is asking which stable isotope is used for measuring total body water. I think isotopic dilution is a method used here. From what I recall, deuterium (which is hydrogen with one neutron) is often used for this purpose. Deuterium is heavier than regular hydrogen, and it's a stable isotope.

Let me go through the options one by one. Option A is Nitrogen 14, which I think is the most common nitrogen isotope, but I don't recall it being used for body water. Option B is Oxygen 16, which is the main isotope of oxygen, but I'm not sure about its use here. Option C is Oxygen 18, which is a heavier isotope and is used in things like ice cores and climate studies, but again, not sure about body water.

Option D is Helium 3, which I think is rare and used more in cryogenics or maybe some medical imaging, but not body water. Option E is Lithium 6, which I believe is used in some batteries and maybe in certain medical treatments, but not related to water measurement. Option F is Nitrogen 15, which is a stable isotope, but I don't think it's used for water. Option G is Hydrogen 3, but wait, Hydrogen typically has one proton. Hydrogen-3 is actually tritium, which is radioactive, so that's not stable. So G is out.

Option H is Carbon 14, which is definitely radioactive, so that's not stable. It's used in radiocarbon dating. Option I is Carbon 13, which is stable but I don't think it's used for water. Option J is Deuterium, which is Hydrogen with one neutron. Yeah, deuterium is the heavy hydrogen, and I remember that it's used in studies where they measure how much water is in the body. They give a known amount of deuterated water, and then by measuring the dilution, they can calculate total body water.

Wait, another thought: I think sometimes they use tritium too, but that's not stable. So the only stable one that makes sense is deuterium. So the answer should be J.

The stable isotope commonly used for measuring total body water is deuterium, which is Hydrogen 3. It is used in isotopic dilution methods to determine the amount of water in the body. 

Answer: J
