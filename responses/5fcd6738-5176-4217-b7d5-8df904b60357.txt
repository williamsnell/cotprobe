Okay, so I have this history question here, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me read it again: "Which of the following groups was converted to Christianity in the tenth century C.E. by missionaries from the Byzantine Empire?" The options are A through J, including groups like Goths, Huns, Normans, Franks, Russians, Anglo-Saxons, Vandals, Moors, Celts, and Visigoths.

Hmm, I remember that the Byzantine Empire, also known as the Eastern Roman Empire, was quite active in spreading Christianity through missionary work. The tenth century is the period we're focusing on here. Let me go through each option one by one.

Starting with option A: Goths. The Goths were a Germanic group that converted to Christianity, but I think they were converted earlier, possibly in the 4th or 5th centuries. They were Arians, if I recall correctly, and their conversion wasn't by the Byzantines but maybe by other missionaries or through their own internal developments.

Option B: Huns. The Huns were a nomadic group that migrated across Europe. I don't think they were particularly known for converting to Christianity in the tenth century. They were more involved in invasions and less in religious conversions.

Option C: Normans. The Normans came later, in the medieval period, and their conversion to Christianity was more associated with the Carolingians or the Catholic Church rather than the Byzantines. Plus, I think their conversion happened earlier, maybe during the Viking Age, but I'm not sure about the exact timeline.

Option D: Franks. The Franks were a significant group in early medieval Europe. They were converted to Christianity in the 5th century by the Roman Church, specifically through the efforts of missionaries like St. Columbanus. So that's earlier than the tenth century, so probably not this one.

Option E: Russians. This might be a good candidate. The Rus' people, who are the ancestors of Russians, were converted to Christianity in the 10th century. I think it was around 988 C.E. when Vladimir the Great converted his people from paganism to Christianity, and the missionaries likely came from the Byzantine Empire, which was the Eastern Orthodox Church at the time. That makes sense because the Byzantines were active in spreading Christianity among neighboring groups, especially through trade and political alliances.

Option F: Anglo-Saxons. The Anglo-Saxons in England were converted to Christianity starting in the 6th century, with missionaries like St. Augustine sent by the Pope in Rome. So that's earlier than the tenth century, and the missionaries were from Rome, not Byzantium. So probably not F.

Option G: Vandals. The Vandals were another Germanic group, and I think they were Arians too, like the Goths. Their conversion happened earlier, and I don't think the Byzantines had much influence over them in the tenth century.

Option H: Moors. The Moors were in North Africa and later Spain, but they were primarily Muslim. The conversion to Christianity wasn't happening in the tenth century; instead, they were spreading Islam. So H is unlikely.

Option I: Celts. The Celts were already Christianized by the time of the Roman Empire, so that's way before the tenth century. They had their own Christian practices, possibly influenced by the early Church, but not by Byzantine missionaries in the tenth century.

Option J: Visigoths. The Visigoths were a branch of the Goths and were established in Spain. They were Arians initially, but I think they converted to Catholicism in the 6th or 7th century. So that's earlier than the tenth century, so J isn't the right answer.

Putting it all together, the only group that fits the criteria is the Russians (option E). They were converted in the tenth century by Byzantine missionaries, specifically through the influence of the Byzantine Empire and the Eastern Orthodox Church.

The correct answer is E: Russians. They were converted to Christianity in the tenth century C.E. by missionaries from the Byzantine Empire.
