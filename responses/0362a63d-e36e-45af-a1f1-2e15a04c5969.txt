Okay, so I have this transformer problem to solve. I'm a bit rusty on my transformer calculations, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

First, the question gives me a lot of data. Let me list out what's given:

- It's a 2,300-volt, 60-cycle power transformer. So the primary voltage is 2300V.
- r1 is 1.28 ohms, which I think is the resistance of the primary winding.
- r2 is 0.0467 ohms, probably the resistance of the secondary winding.
- x1 is 4.24 ohms, which is the reactance of the primary.
- x2 is 0.162 ohms, the reactance of the secondary.

Then there are two test scenarios:

1. **No Load Test**: 2300V at 60Hz is applied to the low-voltage winding (so probably the secondary is the low-voltage side here). The current is 3.57A, and the power is 2140W.

2. **Short-Circuit Test**: The high-voltage winding is shorted, and 48.4V at 60Hz is applied to the low-voltage winding. The input current is 132.6A, and the power is 1934W.

The question asks for the efficiency when the transformer is operating at full kVA with a 0.8 power factor load.

Hmm. So, efficiency is usually calculated as (Output Power) / (Input Power) * 100%. But for transformers, especially under load, we need to consider the losses. Transformer losses include copper losses and iron losses (core losses). Copper losses vary with the load current, while iron losses are mostly constant.

Wait, but when the transformer is under full load, the efficiency will depend on these losses. So first, I think I need to find the full load current and then compute the total losses at that current.

Wait, but the question mentions the efficiency for a full kVA, 0.8 power-factor load. So I need to find the efficiency when the transformer is delivering its full kVA capacity with a 0.8 power factor.

First, maybe I should determine the kVA rating of the transformer. Since it's a power transformer, the kVA is usually the product of voltage and current on the primary or secondary, depending on how it's rated.

Wait, but let's see. The no-load test gives me some data. When the low-voltage side is 2300V, the current is 3.57A, power is 2140W. But wait, no-load implies that the secondary is open, so the current is the magnetizing current. So that current is small, but the power is the core loss (iron loss) plus any no-load copper loss. But since the resistances are given, maybe copper losses are small, but I'm not sure.

Wait, no, in a no-load condition, the current is mainly the magnetizing current, which is typically small, and the power is the core loss, which is usually the iron loss. But let me think again.

Wait, the no-load test is when the secondary is open. So the current on the primary side is the magnetizing current, which is usually small. The power input is mainly the core loss (iron loss). But in this case, the current is 3.57A, which is more than I would expect, but maybe it's because the primary isn't the high-voltage side. Wait, wait, the question says when 2300V is applied to the low-voltage winding. So perhaps the primary is the low-voltage side, and the high-voltage side is the other winding.

Wait, but the problem says: When the high-voltage winding is short-circuited, and 48.4V is applied to the low-voltage side. So in the short-circuit test, the voltage applied is 48.4V on the low-voltage side, and the high is shorted. So the primary is the low-voltage side with 48.4V, and the secondary is shorted.

Wait, perhaps I should figure out the turns ratio. The primary voltage is 2300V on the low-voltage side in the no-load test. So the low-voltage side is 2300V, and the high-voltage side must be higher. But wait, no, in a transformer, the primary is the one with higher voltage usually, but sometimes it's the opposite if it's a step-down or step-up.

Wait, perhaps the primary is the high-voltage side, but in the no-load test, the low-voltage side is 2300V. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to think.

In the no-load test, the low-voltage winding is connected to 2300V, and the current is 3.57A. So that's the current in the low-voltage winding, which is the primary if it's a step-down transformer, but maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the primary is the high-voltage side, and the secondary is the low-voltage side. Let me think again.

Wait, the question says it's a 2,300-volt 60-cycle power transformer. So perhaps the primary is 2300V, and the secondary is lower. So in the no-load test, 2300V is applied to the low-voltage winding, which would mean that the low-voltage side is being used as the primary? That doesn't make sense because usually, the primary is the high-voltage side. Maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the primary is the high-voltage side, but in the no-load test, they applied 2300V to the low-voltage (secondary) side. That would imply that the primary has a higher voltage than 2300V, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should find the turns ratio using the resistances and reactances.

The resistances are r1 = 1.28 ohms for primary, r2 = 0.0467 ohms for secondary. The reactances are x1 = 4.24 ohms, x2 = 0.162 ohms.

Wait, the turns ratio, a, can be found from the resistances. The formula is (r1/r2) = (N2/N1)^2, where N1 is the primary turns, N2 is secondary. So the turns ratio a = N1/N2 = sqrt(r2/r1).

So a = sqrt(r2/r1) = sqrt(0.0467 / 1.28) = sqrt(0.0365625) ≈ 0.1912.

Wait, that makes sense because if the primary is the high-voltage side, then the turns ratio is a = N1/N2, so the secondary voltage would be V2 = a * V1.

Wait, but in the no-load test, 2300V is applied to the low-voltage winding (secondary). So the primary would have a higher voltage, but in this case, the no-load test is on the secondary. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the primary is the low-voltage side, so when 2300V is applied to the low-voltage side, the high-voltage side would have a higher voltage. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute the kVA rating using the short-circuit test data.

In the short-circuit test, the applied voltage is 48.4V on the low-voltage side, and the current is 132.6A. So the short-circuit current is 132.6A. The power is 1934W, which is the copper loss at that current.

Wait, because in the short-circuit test, the transformer is in a low-voltage condition, so the current is high, but the power is the copper loss.

So the copper loss at full load can be calculated, but perhaps I should first find the full load current.

Wait, the problem asks for the efficiency at full kVA, 0.8 power factor. So first, I need to find the full kVA capacity of the transformer.

So, the kVA is the product of the voltage and current on the primary or secondary, depending on which side is being used.

Wait, perhaps the primary is the low-voltage side. So, in the no-load test, 2300V is applied to the low-voltage side, and the current is 3.57A. The power is 2140W.

But wait, in the no-load condition, the current is the magnetizing current. The power is the core loss plus any no-load copper loss. But perhaps for this problem, the core loss can be taken as the power at no-load, which is 2140W.

Wait, but during the short-circuit test, the power is 1934W, which is the copper loss when the current is 132.6A on the low-voltage side. So that would be the total copper loss in the primary and secondary windings.

Wait, but how to find the full load current?

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the kVA of the transformer from the short-circuit test. Because when the transformer is shorted, the applied voltage is such that the current is the full load current. So when the secondary is shorted and a certain voltage is applied to the primary, the current is the full load current.

Wait, in the short-circuit test, the applied voltage is 48.4V on the low-voltage side, and the current is 132.6A. So perhaps the full load current on the low-voltage side is 132.6A.

Wait, but the transformer's kVA would be the product of the primary voltage and primary current. So if the primary is the low-voltage side, then the kVA would be 48.4V * 132.6A, but that's for the short-circuit test.

Wait, no, the short-circuit test is when the transformer is operating at maximum current, but the voltage is low. So the full load current would be when the transformer is delivering its kVA at rated voltage.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try another approach.

The efficiency is given by η = (Output Power) / (Input Power) * 100%.

At full load, the input power is the sum of the output power plus the total losses (copper and iron). So, η = (P_out) / (P_out + P_loss) * 100%.

But to find the efficiency, I need to know the total losses at full load. The total losses are the sum of the iron loss (which is constant) and the copper loss (which depends on load current).

So, to find the losses, I need to find the iron loss (from the no-load test) and the copper loss at full load.

From the no-load test: the power is 2140W, which is mainly the iron loss (core loss) plus any no-load copper loss. But since the resistances are given, perhaps the no-load current is small enough that the copper loss is negligible. But let's check.

The no-load current is 3.57A on the low-voltage side. The copper loss would be I^2 * r, where r is the resistance on that side. So for the low-voltage side (r1 = 1.28 ohms), the copper loss is 3.57^2 * 1.28 ≈ 16.25 * 1.28 ≈ 20.8 W. So the total no-load power is 2140W, which includes core loss and 20.8W copper loss. So the core loss would be 2140 - 20.8 ≈ 2119.2W. But that's almost the same as 2140, which doesn't make sense because the core loss should be higher. Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, no, in the no-load test, the current is on the low-voltage side. So the copper loss would be I^2 * (r1 + (r2 * (N1/N2)^2 ))? Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the no-load current is primarily the magnetizing current, which is small, so the copper loss is negligible, and the 2140W is approximately the core loss.

But in the short-circuit test, the power is 1934W, which is the total copper loss when the current is 132.6A on the low-voltage side. So the copper loss is I^2 * (r1 + (r2 * (a^2))), where a is the turns ratio. Wait, maybe I should compute the total copper loss at full load.

Wait, perhaps I should find the full load current first. The full load current would be when the transformer is delivering its kVA rating. The kVA is the product of the primary voltage and primary current. But I'm not sure which side is which.

Alternatively, perhaps the kVA is determined by the short-circuit test. The short-circuit test gives the maximum current the transformer can handle before saturation, which would be the full load current.

Wait, in the short-circuit test, the transformer is operating at maximum current, so the current is the full load current. So the full load current on the primary (low-voltage side) would be 132.6A. So the kVA would be the primary voltage (48.4V) multiplied by 132.6A, but that's 48.4 * 132.6 ≈ 6395 VA, which seems high. Wait, but that's for the short-circuit test, which is when the voltage is low and current is high, so perhaps the kVA is the same as the full load kVA.

Wait, but the primary voltage in the short-circuit test is 48.4V, and the current is 132.6A. So the kVA would be 48.4 * 132.6 ≈ 6395 kVA? No, that can't be right because 48.4V * 132.6A is 6395 VA, which is 6.395 kVA. That seems more reasonable.

Wait, but the problem states it's a 2300-volt transformer, so the primary voltage is 2300V on the low-voltage side. That doesn't make sense because usually, the primary is the high-voltage side. Maybe I'm getting the sides mixed up.

Alternatively, perhaps the primary is the high-voltage side (2300V), and the secondary is the low-voltage side. So in the no-load test, 2300V is applied to the low-voltage side, which would imply that the primary is the high-voltage side, but that's confusing.

Wait, maybe I should approach this differently. Let's find the turns ratio using the resistances.

The turns ratio a = N1/N2 = sqrt(r2/r1) = sqrt(0.0467 / 1.28) ≈ sqrt(0.0365625) ≈ 0.1912.

So the secondary has fewer turns than the primary. So the primary is the high-voltage side, and the secondary is the low-voltage side.

So, the primary voltage (high side) is 2300V. The secondary voltage (low side) would be V2 = V1 / a = 2300V / 0.1912 ≈ 12031V. That seems extremely high, which probably isn't correct. Maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, no, wait. The turns ratio is a = N1/N2, so the primary voltage is V1 = a * V2. So if the primary is the high-voltage side, then V1 = a * V2. But in the no-load test, 2300V is applied to the low-voltage side, so V2 = 2300V. Then the primary voltage would be V1 = a * V2 ≈ 0.1912 * 2300 ≈ 439.76V. That doesn't make sense because the primary is supposed to be the high-voltage side.

Hmm, maybe I got the turns ratio the other way. Let me try a = N2/N1. Then a = sqrt(r1/r2) = sqrt(1.28 / 0.0467) ≈ sqrt(27.41) ≈ 5.235.

So a = N2/N1 = 5.235, which means the secondary has more turns than the primary. So the primary is the low-voltage side, and the secondary is the high-voltage side.

So when 2300V is applied to the low-voltage side, the secondary voltage would be V2 = a * V1 = 5.235 * 2300 ≈ 12,040V. That's a very high voltage, which might be correct for a power transformer.

In the short-circuit test, the high-voltage side is shorted, and 48.4V is applied to the low-voltage side. So the current on the low-voltage side is 132.6A, which would be the full load current on the low-voltage side. Therefore, the kVA rating is 48.4V * 132.6A ≈ 6395 VA ≈ 6.395 kVA.

Wait, but the problem mentions a full kVA load, which is 0.8 power factor. So the kVA is the same as the transformer's rating, which we've calculated as approximately 6.395 kVA.

Now, to find the efficiency, we need to calculate the total losses at full load.

The total losses consist of:

1. Iron loss (core loss) from the no-load test.
2. Copper loss at full load.

We can calculate the copper loss at full load using the resistances and the current.

But first, let's find the iron loss. From the no-load test, the power is 2140W, which is the iron loss plus any no-load copper loss. The no-load current is 3.57A on the low-voltage side. The copper loss on the low-voltage side would be I^2 * r1 = (3.57)^2 * 1.28 ≈ 12.74 * 1.28 ≈ 16.25W. Similarly, the current on the high-voltage side would be I = I1 * a = 3.57 * 5.235 ≈ 18.66A. The copper loss on the high side is I^2 * r2 = (18.66)^2 * 0.0467 ≈ 348.1 * 0.0467 ≈ 16.18W. So total no-load copper loss is 16.25 + 16.18 ≈ 32.43W. Therefore, the iron loss is 2140 - 32.43 ≈ 2107.57W.

Now, the copper loss at full load is calculated using the current on both sides. At full load, the current on the low-voltage side is 132.6A, as given in the short-circuit test. The current on the high-voltage side would be I2 = I1 * a = 132.6 * 5.235 ≈ 696.08A. That's a very high current, which might not be practical, but perhaps it's correct for the short-circuit condition.

Wait, but in the short-circuit test, the high-voltage side is shorted, so the current is the same as the full load current on the low-voltage side. So the total copper loss would be I1^2 * r1 + I2^2 * r2.

Wait, but I1 is 132.6A on the low-voltage side, and I2 is I1 * (N1/N2) = 132.6 * (1/5.235) ≈ 25.33A. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, since the current in the primary (low-voltage side) is I1, the current in the secondary (high-voltage side) would be I2 = I1 * (N1/N2) = I1 / a = 132.6 / 5.235 ≈ 25.33A.

Wait, but that can't be right because in a short-circuit, the current would be determined by the applied voltage and the total resistance. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the current in the short-circuit test is the same on both sides, but that's not correct because the turns ratio affects the current.

Wait, perhaps I should model the transformer as a two-winding circuit during the short-circuit test. When the high-voltage side is shorted, the current in the primary (low-voltage side) is determined by the applied voltage and the total resistance, considering the turns ratio.

The equivalent circuit during the short-circuit test would have the primary resistance r1 and the secondary resistance r2, but the secondary is shorted, so the total resistance seen by the primary is r1 + (r2 * (N1/N2)^2) )= r1 + r2 * a^2.

Wait, no, the secondary resistance when referred to the primary side is r2 * (a)^2, where a is the turns ratio N1/N2.

So the total resistance in the primary circuit during the short-circuit test is r1 + (r2 * a^2).

Given that a = N1/N2 = 5.235, so a^2 ≈ 27.41.

So r2_ref = r2 * a^2 = 0.0467 * 27.41 ≈ 1.28 ohms.

So the total resistance is r1 + r2_ref = 1.28 + 1.28 = 2.56 ohms.

The applied voltage is 48.4V, so the current would be I = 48.4V / 2.56 ohms ≈ 18.91A. But the question states that the current is 132.6A, which is much higher than this calculation. Hmm, so I must have made a mistake in the turns ratio.

Wait, perhaps I got the turns ratio wrong. Let me recalculate the turns ratio.

The formula is a = N1/N2 = sqrt(r2/r1) = sqrt(0.0467 / 1.28) ≈ sqrt(0.0365625) ≈ 0.1912.

Wait, that's correct. So a = 0.1912, meaning N1 is smaller than N2. So the primary is the low-voltage side, and the secondary is the high-voltage side.

So, the equivalent resistance of the secondary referred to the primary is r2 * (a)^2 = 0.0467 * (0.1912)^2 ≈ 0.0467 * 0.03656 ≈ 0.001706 ohms.

So the total resistance in the primary during the short-circuit test is r1 + r2_ref = 1.28 + 0.001706 ≈ 1.2817 ohms.

The applied voltage is 48.4V, so the current would be I = 48.4 / 1.2817 ≈ 37.76A. But the question says the current is 132.6A, which is much higher. So something's wrong here.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the short-circuit test is done on the high-voltage side. So the transformer is connected with the high-voltage side shorted, and the low-voltage side is applied with 48.4V.

Wait, but in that case, the equivalent resistance would be different.

The equivalent resistance when the high-voltage side is shorted would be r1_ref + r2, where r1_ref is the primary resistance referred to the secondary side.

r1_ref = r1 * (N2/N1)^2 = r1 / a^2 = 1.28 / (0.1912)^2 ≈ 1.28 / 0.03656 ≈ 35.02 ohms.

So the total resistance is r1_ref + r2 = 35.02 + 0.0467 ≈ 35.0667 ohms.

The applied voltage is 48.4V, so the current would be 48.4 / 35.0667 ≈ 1.38A, which doesn't match the given 132.6A. So that's not right.

Hmm, I'm confused. Maybe I should approach this differently. Let's think about the short-circuit test again.

In the short-circuit test, the transformer is shorted on one side, and a voltage is applied to the other. The current in this test is the full load current on the side where the voltage is applied.

So, in this case, the high-voltage side is shorted, and 48.4V is applied to the low-voltage side. The current on the low-voltage side is 132.6A, which would be the full load current on that side.

So the kVA rating is 48.4V * 132.6A ≈ 6395 VA ≈ 6.395 kVA.

Now, the efficiency is calculated as (Output Power) / (Input Power) * 100%. The output power is the input power minus the losses.

The losses consist of the iron loss (from the no-load test) and the copper loss at full load.

From the no-load test, the power is 2140W, which is approximately the iron loss. The copper loss during no-load is minimal, so we'll take 2140W as the iron loss.

The copper loss at full load is I^2 * (r1 + (r2 * (N1/N2)^2)). Wait, but I think I should calculate the copper loss on both sides. Since the current on the low-voltage side is 132.6A, the current on the high-voltage side would be I2 = I1 * (N1/N2) = 132.6 * 0.1912 ≈ 25.33A.

So, the copper loss on the low-voltage side is I1^2 * r1 = (132.6)^2 * 1.28 ≈ 17,582.76 * 1.28 ≈ 22,411.5 W.

The copper loss on the high-voltage side is I2^2 * r2 = (25.33)^2 * 0.0467 ≈ 641.5 * 0.0467 ≈ 29.52 W.

Total copper loss is 22,411.5 + 29.52 ≈ 22,441 W.

Wait, that's 22.441 kW. That seems extremely high for a 6.395 kVA transformer. That can't be right because the copper loss would be much lower than the output power.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the current on the high-voltage side. Because in a transformer, the current on the primary and secondary are inversely proportional to their turns ratios. So, I2 = I1 * (N1/N2) = I1 * a.

Given that a = 0.1912, I2 = 132.6 * 0.1912 ≈ 25.33A.

But the copper loss on the low-voltage side is I1^2 * r1 = 132.6^2 * 1.28 ≈ (17,582.76) * 1.28 ≈ 22,411.5 W.

That's 22.4 kW of copper loss. But the transformer's kVA is only 6.395 kVA, which means the output power is I * V = 132.6A * 48.4V ≈ 6,395W, which is 6.395 kVA. The copper loss is 22.4 kW, which is way higher than the output power, which doesn't make sense because the efficiency would be negative.

Wait, that can't be right. I must have made a mistake in calculating the copper loss.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the total copper loss using the total current in the primary and secondary during full load.

Wait, another approach: the total copper loss at full load is the same as the power measured during the short-circuit test. Because in the short-circuit test, the current is the full load current, and the power is the total copper loss.

Wait, but in the short-circuit test, the power is 1934W, which would be the total copper loss at full load. So that's easier. So the copper loss is 1934W.

So, total losses at full load are iron loss + copper loss = 2140W + 1934W = 4074W.

The output power at full load is kVA * power factor = 6.395 kVA * 0.8 = 5.116 kV·A·cosθ = 5.116 kVA * 0.8 = 4.0928 kW (4092.8W).

So, the input power is output power + losses = 4092.8 + 4074 = 8166.8W.

Efficiency η = (4092.8 / 8166.8) * 100 ≈ 50.14%. That can't be right because the options are all above 90%.

Wait, I must have made a mistake in calculating the kVA. Because the short-circuit test gives the current as 132.6A on the low-voltage side when 48.4V is applied. So the kVA would be 48.4V * 132.6A ≈ 6395 VA, which is 6.395 kVA. But that seems high, and the copper loss in the short-circuit test is 1934W, which is much lower than the output power, leading to a low efficiency.

Wait, perhaps I should instead find the kVA using the no-load test. The no-load power is 2140W, which is the iron loss. The full load output would be P_out = kVA * 0.8. The input power would be P_out + losses (iron + copper).

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Maybe I should use the formula for efficiency:

η = (kVA * power factor) / (√( (kVA)^2 + (kVA * power factor)^2 )) * 100%.

Wait, no, that's not right. Alternatively, the efficiency formula when considering losses is:

η = (kVA * pf) / (√(kVA^2 + (kVA * pf)^2 )) * 100% 

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the total impedance and find the voltage drop.

Alternatively, maybe I should find the voltage on the secondary side under load and then compute the efficiency.

Wait, perhaps I should find the impedance of the transformer and then compute the voltage drop at full load.

The total impedance Z1 on the primary side is sqrt(r1^2 + x1^2) = sqrt(1.28^2 + 4.24^2) ≈ sqrt(1.6384 + 17.9776) ≈ sqrt(19.616) ≈ 4.43 ohms.

Similarly, Z2 = sqrt(r2^2 + x2^2) = sqrt(0.0467^2 + 0.162^2) ≈ sqrt(0.00218 + 0.02624) ≈ sqrt(0.02842) ≈ 0.1686 ohms.

The equivalent impedance when the transformer is under load can be calculated, but perhaps it's easier to find the voltage drop and then compute the efficiency.

At full load, the current is I1 = (kVA * 1000) / (V1) = (6.395 * 1000) / 2300 ≈ 2.78A on the primary side. Wait, no, that's not correct because the primary voltage is 2300V, and the kVA is 6.395, so I1 = 6.395 / 2300 ≈ 0.00278 A, which is not correct.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the sides wrong. The primary is the low-voltage side with 48.4V in the short-circuit test, but when the transformer is rated at 2300V on the low-voltage side, the primary is the low-voltage side, and the secondary is the high-voltage side.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the efficiency can be calculated using the formula:

η = (P2 / (P1)) * 100%, where P2 is the output power, and P1 is the input power.

But P1 = P2 + losses.

At full load, P2 = kVA * power factor = 6395 VA * 0.8 = 5116W.

The losses are 2140W (iron) + 1934W (copper) = 4074W.

So P1 = 5116 + 4074 = 9190W.

Efficiency η = (5116 / 9190) * 100 ≈ 55.6%. But that's not matching any of the options.

Wait, but the options are all above 90%, so I must have made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the full load is not the same as the short-circuit current. Maybe the full load current is lower.

Wait, perhaps the kVA is determined by the no-load test and the short-circuit test together. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the impedance of the transformer and then find the voltage drop under load.

The transformer's impedance Z can be found from the short-circuit test. The short-circuit impedance Zsc is the voltage applied divided by the current, so Zsc = 48.4V / 132.6A ≈ 0.364 ohms.

But that's the impedance on the low-voltage side. The total impedance on the primary side would be Zsc * a^2, where a is the turns ratio.

Wait, a is N1/N2 = 0.1912, so a^2 ≈ 0.03656.

So Zsc_primary = 0.364 * 0.03656 ≈ 0.0133 ohms.

But I'm not sure if that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the total impedance is Z1 + Z2, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should model the transformer as having two windings with their own resistances and reactances, and then calculate the efficiency based on that.

The efficiency formula for a transformer under load is:

η = (V2 * I2 * cosθ) / (V1 * I1) * 100%.

But I need to find I1, which is the current on the primary side when the secondary is loaded.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Maybe I should use the formula for efficiency considering the load.

The formula for efficiency is:

η = (kVA * pf) / (kVA * pf + (I² * R)) * 100%.

But I'm not sure about the exact formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the efficiency can be found using the formula:

η = (I2² R2 + I1² R1) / (V1 I1) * 100%.

Wait, no, that's not right. Efficiency is output over input, so:

η = (V2 I2 cosθ) / (V1 I1) * 100%.

But to find I1, we can use the transformer's turns ratio and the load current.

I1 = I2 * (N2/N1) = I2 / a.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps it's better to look for the formula for efficiency in terms of the given data.

The efficiency of a transformer under a load is given by:

η = (V2 I2 cosθ) / (V1 I1) * 100%.

But we can express I1 in terms of I2 and the turns ratio.

I1 = I2 * (N2/N1) = I2 / a.

So, η = (V2 I2 cosθ) / (V1 (I2 / a)) ) * 100% = (a V2 I2 cosθ) / (V1 I2) ) * 100% = (a V2 cosθ) / V1 * 100%.

But a = N1/N2 = sqrt(r2/r1) ≈ 0.1912.

So, η = (0.1912 * V2 * cosθ) / V1 * 100%.

Wait, but I don't know V2 under load. V2 would be the secondary voltage under load, which is V1 (primary voltage) minus the voltage drop due to the current and the impedance.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the voltage regulation and then compute the efficiency.

Voltage regulation is the drop in voltage from no-load to full load.

But I'm not sure. Maybe I should use the formula for efficiency considering the load.

Wait, perhaps the best approach is to use the data from the short-circuit test to find the total copper loss at full load and the no-load test for the iron loss, then compute the efficiency as follows:

Efficiency η = (kVA * power factor) / (kVA * power factor + iron loss + copper loss) * 100%.

So, let's proceed with that.

First, find the kVA rating. From the short-circuit test, when 48.4V is applied to the low-voltage side, the current is 132.6A. So the kVA is 48.4 * 132.6 ≈ 6395 VA ≈ 6.395 kVA.

Iron loss (from no-load test) = 2140W.

Copper loss at full load (from short-circuit test) = 1934W.

Total losses = 2140 + 1934 = 4074W.

Output power at full load = kVA * power factor = 6395 VA * 0.8 = 5116W.

Input power = Output + losses = 5116 + 4074 = 9190W.

Efficiency η = (5116 / 9190) * 100 ≈ 55.6%.

But this is nowhere near the options given (all above 90%). So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the kVA is not 6.395 kVA. Maybe the kVA is determined differently.

Wait, perhaps the kVA is determined from the no-load test. The no-load power is 2140W, which is the iron loss. The full load power would be higher, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should find the voltage on the high-voltage side and then compute the kVA.

From the turns ratio a = 0.1912, so the high-voltage side voltage V2 = a * V1 = 0.1912 * 2300 ≈ 439.76V. That seems low for a high-voltage side, but maybe it's correct.

So the kVA would be V2 * I2, where I2 is the current on the high-voltage side at full load.

Wait, but I don't know I2 yet.

Alternatively, perhaps the kVA is the same on both sides, so when the low-voltage side is 2300V, the high-voltage side would have a higher voltage, but I'm not sure.

I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps the transformer's efficiency can be found using the formula:

η = (η1 * η2) * 100%, where η1 is the efficiency of the core and η2 is the efficiency of the copper.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for efficiency considering the load:

η = (V2 I2 cosθ) / (V1 I1 + I2^2 R2 + I1^2 R1) * 100%.

But I need to find I1 and I2.

Alternatively, perhaps I should find the equivalent resistance and reactance and then compute the voltage drop and efficiency.

The equivalent impedance on the primary side is Z1 = sqrt(r1^2 + x1^2) ≈ 4.43 ohms.

The secondary impedance referred to the primary is Z2_ref = Z2 * (N1/N2)^2 = Z2 * a^2.

Z2 = sqrt(r2^2 + x2^2) ≈ 0.1686 ohms.

So Z2_ref = 0.1686 * (0.1912)^2 ≈ 0.1686 * 0.03656 ≈ 0.00617 ohms.

So the total impedance on the primary side is Z_total = Z1 + Z2_ref ≈ 4.43 + 0.00617 ≈ 4.436 ohms.

At full load, the current I1 = (kVA * 1000) / (V1) = (6395 * 1000) / 2300 ≈ 2.78A.

Wait, but that would be the current on the primary side, which is the low-voltage side. The voltage drop would be I1 * Z_total ≈ 2.78 * 4.436 ≈ 12.25V.

So the voltage on the primary side would be V1 - voltage drop ≈ 2300V - 12.25V ≈ 2287.75V.

Then, the voltage on the secondary side would be V2 = a * V1 ≈ 0.1912 * 2287.75 ≈ 439.76V.

The current on the secondary side would be I2 = (kVA * 1000) / V2 ≈ 6395 / 439.76 ≈ 14.54A.

The power output would be V2 * I2 * cosθ ≈ 439.76V * 14.54A * 0.8 ≈ 439.76 * 11.632 ≈ 5116W.

The input power would be V1 * I1 ≈ 2300V * 2.78A ≈ 6,394W.

The losses would be 6394 - 5116 ≈ 1278W.

The efficiency η = (5116 / 6394) * 100 ≈ 79.8%. Still not matching the options.

I'm clearly making a mistake somewhere. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I'm using the wrong kVA. Let's try to find the kVA using the resistances and the given data.

The copper loss in the short-circuit test is I_SC^2 * (r1 + (r2 * (N1/N2)^2 )) = 132.6^2 * (1.28 + (0.0467 * (0.1912)^2 )) ≈ 17,582.76 * (1.28 + 0.001706) ≈ 17,582.76 * 1.2817 ≈ 22,442W.

But the power in the short-circuit test is given as 1934W, which is the copper loss. So:

1934 = I_SC^2 * (r1 + (r2 * a^2 )).

Wait, but we have I_SC = 132.6A, so:

132.6^2 * (1.28 + 0.0467 * a^2 ) = 1934.

Calculate:

132.6^2 = 17,582.76.

So 17,582.76 * (1.28 + 0.0467 * a^2 ) = 1934.

Divide both sides by 17,582.76:

1.28 + 0.0467 * a^2 ≈ 1934 / 17,582.76 ≈ 0.10998.

So 0.0467 * a^2 ≈ 0.10998 - 1.28 ≈ -1.17002.

That can't be right because a^2 is positive, and 0.0467 * a^2 can't be negative. So I must have made a mistake in the equation.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

P_SC = I_SC^2 * (r1 + r2 * (N1/N2)^2 ) = I_SC^2 * (r1 + r2 * a^2).

Given that a = N1/N2 = 0.1912, so a^2 ≈ 0.03656.

So P_SC = 132.6^2 * (1.28 + 0.0467 * 0.03656) ≈ 17,582.76 * (1.28 + 0.001706) ≈ 17,582.76 * 1.2817 ≈ 22,442W.

But the given P_SC is 1934W, which is much lower. So this suggests that my earlier assumption about the turns ratio is wrong. Therefore, perhaps the turns ratio is calculated differently.

Wait, perhaps the turns ratio is a = N2/N1 = sqrt(r1/r2) = sqrt(1.28 / 0.0467) ≈ 5.235.

So a = N2/N1 = 5.235, meaning N1 = N2 / 5.235.

In that case, the primary is the low-voltage side, and the secondary is the high-voltage side.

So, when 48.4V is applied to the low-voltage side, the current is 132.6A, which is the full load current on the primary side.

The kVA would be 48.4 * 132.6 ≈ 6395 VA ≈ 6.395 kVA.

Now, the copper loss at full load is given by the short-circuit test as 1934W.

The iron loss from the no-load test is 2140W.

Total losses = 2140 + 1934 = 4074W.

Output power = 6.395 kVA * 0.8 = 5.116 kW = 5116W.

Input power = Output + losses = 5116 + 4074 = 9190W.

Efficiency η = (5116 / 9190) * 100 ≈ 55.6%.

This still doesn't match the options.

Wait, perhaps the no-load power includes both core loss and no-load copper loss, so the core loss is less than 2140W.

Earlier, I calculated the no-load copper loss as 32.43W, so core loss would be 2140 - 32.43 ≈ 2107.57W.

But that still leads to the same issue.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the short-circuit test is on the high-voltage side, and the current is lower. Let me try that.

If the high-voltage side is shorted, the current would be higher because the voltage is higher. Wait, but the short-circuit test is done on the low-voltage side, as per the problem statement.

I'm clearly stuck and not getting the right approach. Maybe I should look for another way.

Wait, perhaps the efficiency can be calculated using the formula:

η = (kVA * pf) / (kVA * pf + (I² * R_total)) * 100%.

Where R_total is the total copper resistance at full load.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the efficiency is given by:

η = (V2 I2 cosθ) / (V1 I1 + I1² r1 + I2² r2) * 100%.

But without knowing the exact values, it's hard to proceed.

Given the time I've spent and the confusion, perhaps I should look at the options and see which one makes sense. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to find the efficiency using the given data without considering the kVA.

The efficiency formula is:

η = (V2 I2 cosθ) / (V1 I1) * 100%.

But I don't know V2 and I2.

Alternatively, perhaps the efficiency can be found using the formula:

η = (η_iron + η_copper) * 100%.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option F: 99.1%. Because the losses are relatively small compared to the output power, but I'm not certain.
</think>

To determine the efficiency of the transformer under a full kVA, 0.8 power-factor load, the following steps were considered:

1. **Transformer Data and Tests**:
   - The transformer has a 2,300-volt primary and a low-voltage secondary.
   - No-load test: 2300V applied to the low-voltage winding, resulting in 3.57A current and 2140W power.
   - Short-circuit test: 48.4V applied to the low-voltage winding with the high-voltage winding shorted, resulting in 132.6A current and 1934W power.

2. **Turns Ratio and Impedance**:
   - The turns ratio \( a = \frac{N_1}{N_2} = \sqrt{\frac{r_2}{r_1}} = \sqrt{\frac{0.0467}{1.28}} \approx 0.1912 \).
   - The primary resistance \( r_1 = 1.28 \, \Omega \) and secondary resistance \( r_2 = 0.0467 \, \Omega \) were used to calculate the equivalent impedance.

3. **kVA Rating**:
   - From the short-circuit test, the full-load current on the low-voltage side is 132.6A when 48.4V is applied. Thus, the kVA rating is:
     \[
     \text{kVA} = 48.4 \, \text{V} \times 132.6 \, \text{A} \approx 6.395 \, \text{kVA}.
     \]

4. **Losses**:
   - **Iron Loss**: From the no-load test, the power is 2140W, which is approximately the core loss.
   - **Copper Loss**: From the short-circuit test, the power is 1934W, representing the total copper loss at full load.

5. **Efficiency Calculation**:
   - Total losses at full load:
     \[
     \text{Total Losses} = \text{Iron Loss} + \text{Copper Loss} = 2140 \, \text{W} + 1934 \, \text{W} = 4074 \, \text{W}.
     \]
   - Output power at full load (0.8 power factor):
     \[
     \text{Output Power} = \text{kVA} \times \text{Power Factor} = 6.395 \, \text{kVA} \times 0.8 = 5.116 \, \text{kW} = 5116 \, \text{W}.
     \]
   - Input power:
     \[
     \text{Input Power} = \text{Output Power} + \text{Total Losses} = 5116 \, \text{W} + 4074 \, \text{W} = 9190 \, \text{W}.
     \]
   - Efficiency:
     \[
     \eta = \frac{\text{Output Power}}{\text{Input Power}} \times 100 = \frac{5116}{9190} \times 100 \approx 55.6\%.
     \]

6. **Mismatch and Reassessment**:
   - The calculated efficiency of 55.6% does not match the provided options, suggesting an error in assumptions or calculations. However, based on the given options and the high efficiency expected for modern transformers, the closest plausible answer is **99.1%**.

ANSWER: F
