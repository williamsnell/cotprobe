Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question here, and I need to figure out which game isn't played with cards. The options are A through I, and I need to choose the correct one. Let me go through each option one by one and think about what I know about each game.

First, the question is asking which game is not played with cards. So, I need to identify the one that doesn't use cards as its primary tool. Let's start with each option.

Option A: Euchre. I remember that Euchre is a trick-taking card game. It's usually played with a deck of cards, and the goal is to be the first to make the agreed number of tricks. So, that's definitely a card game. So, A is played with cards.

Option B: Craps. Hmm, I think craps is a casino game. I'm pretty sure it's played with dice, not cards. Craps involves rolling two dice and betting on the outcomes. So, that's not a card game. That might be the answer, but I'll check the others to be sure.

Option C: Bridge. Bridge is a well-known trick-taking card game. It involves four players and a standard deck of cards. So, definitely uses cards. So, C is a card game.

Option D: Solitaire. Solitaire, also known as patience, is a game where you arrange cards into piles following specific rules. It's typically played with a standard deck and is a solo game, not against others. So, D is a card game.

Option E: Poker. Poker is one of the most popular card games. It involves hands of cards and betting, so E is definitely a card game.

Option F: Blackjack. Blackjack is another casino game, but I believe it's played with cards, specifically using one or more decks. The goal is to get a hand total as close to 21 as possible without going over. So, F uses cards.

Option G: Hearts. Hearts is a trick-taking card game where the goal is to minimize the number of hearts you end up with. It's played with a standard deck, so G is a card game.

Option H: Baccarat. Baccarat is a casino card game. It's played with a standard deck, and players bet on which hand will win: the player's or the banker's. So, H uses cards.

Option I: Rummy. Rummy is a family of card games where players draw and discard cards to form sets and runs. So, I is a card game.

So, going through each option, the only one that doesn't involve cards is B: Craps. It uses dice instead. Therefore, the answer should be B.

The answer is B: craps, as it is played with dice, not cards.

Answer: B
