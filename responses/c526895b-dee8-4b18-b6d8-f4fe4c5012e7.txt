Okay, so I've got this question about ionic bonds and how certain changes affect the bond strength. Hmm, I remember that ionic bonds are between positive and negative ions, right? The strength has to do with the charges and the sizes of the ions. Let me think this through step by step.

The question has four parts: (a), (b), (c), and (d). Each part changes a different aspect, and I need to figure out the effect on bond strength. The options are A through J, each giving different outcomes for each part.

Let me start by recalling the formula for the strength of an ionic bond. I think it's related to Coulomb's law, which is F = (k * |q1 * q2|) / r², where k is Coulomb's constant, q1 and q2 are the charges, and r is the distance between the ions. So the bond strength is proportional to the product of the charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance (radius) between them.

So, bond strength ∝ (charge on A * charge on B) / (radius of A + radius of B)². Wait, or is it just each radius individually? Hmm, I think it's the sum of the radii because that's the distance between the centers of the ions.

Let's tackle each part one by one.

(a) Doubling the charge on A. The charge on A was originally, say, +1. If I double it to +2, what happens to the bond strength? Since bond strength is proportional to the product of the charges, doubling A's charge would double the product. So bond strength should double. Wait, but I'm not so sure. Because if only A's charge doubles, the product becomes 2*qA * qB, so it's multiplied by 2. So the bond strength would be doubled. So for part (a), the bond strength is doubled.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, I might have gotten that wrong. Let me think again. If the original charge on A is Q, and on B is q, then the product is Q * q. If Q doubles, the product becomes 2Q * q, so the bond strength increases by 2. So yes, part (a) should double the bond strength.

(b) Simultaneously doubling the charge on A and B. So both charges are doubled. The original product is Q * q. Now it's (2Q) * (2q) = 4Qq. So the product is four times larger. So the bond strength quadruples. Wait, but looking at the options, I need to see which option has (a) as doubled and (b) as quadrupled.

Wait, but looking at the options, let me check. For example, option I says (a) is doubled, (b) is quadrupled. That fits so far. But let me continue to check the other parts.

(c) Doubling the radius of B. The radius of B is part of the denominator in the bond strength formula. The bond strength is inversely proportional to r². So if the radius of B doubles, the sum of the radii (assuming A's radius remains the same) would increase. Wait, but the problem says only B's radius is doubled. So the new distance is rA + 2rB, whereas before it was rA + rB. How does this affect the bond strength? Let me think about the ratio. The original distance is r = rA + rB. If only rB doubles, the new distance is r' = rA + 2rB. Let me compute (r')² = (rA + 2rB)². Comparing to r² = (rA + rB)².

But wait, in the case where A's radius doesn't change, the new denominator is (rA + 2rB)². So the bond strength would be inversely proportional to this. So if rB doubles, the denominator becomes (rA + 2rB)². Let's compute the factor by which the denominator increases. Let me make an example. Suppose rA = x and rB = y. Then original denominator is (x + y)^2. After doubling B's radius, it's (x + 2y)^2. The ratio is (x+2y)^2 / (x+y)^2.

Wait, but without knowing the actual values, it's hard to compute exactly. But I can think about the effect on the bond strength. Since the denominator increases, the bond strength decreases. The question is, by how much?

Wait, but the problem says "simultaneously doubling the radius of B" in part (c). Let me think about the case where only B's radius doubles. So, the new r is rA + 2rB. The original r was rA + rB. The bond strength is inversely proportional to r², so the new bond strength would be (original bond strength) multiplied by (original r²)/(new r²). So S' = S * (r²)/(r'²).

But without specific values, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the ratio. Let me suppose that rA is much smaller than rB. So rA << rB. Then, original r ≈ rB, new r ≈ 2rB. So denominator increases by (2rB)^2 / (rB)^2 = 4. So bond strength would decrease by a factor of 4. So S' = S/4.

But if rA is not negligible compared to rB, then the change would be less. For example, if rA = rB, then original r is 2rB, new r is rB + 2rB = 3rB. So original r² is (2rB)^2 = 4rB², new r² is 9rB². So the factor is 4/9, so S' = S * (4/9) ≈ 0.44 S. So it's less than a quarter.

Wait, but the question doesn't specify whether rA is smaller or larger than rB. So perhaps the best approach is to consider that increasing the radius of B would increase the distance, thus decreasing the bond strength. But the exact factor isn't clear without more info. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the question assumes that the sum of the radii is proportional to each radius. Maybe it's a bit tricky.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of relative changes. Let me consider that the distance between A and B is proportional to the sum of their radii. So if B's radius doubles, the distance becomes (rA + 2rB) = rA + rB + rB = r + rB. Hmm, but without knowing rA and rB, it's hard to compute the exact factor. Maybe I should look for an option that corresponds to the bond strength being halved, or something else.

Wait, but looking at the options, option I says (c) is halved. Let me check if that makes sense. So if bond strength is inversely proportional to r², and r doubles, then bond strength would be 1/4th. But wait, in part (c), only B's radius doubles. So the denominator increases by (rA + 2rB)². Let's make an example where rA = 1 and rB = 1. Original r = 2, so r²=4. After doubling B's radius, r becomes 1 + 2=3, so r²=9. Bond strength is inversely proportional, so 4/9 ≈ 0.444, which is about a quarter. So the bond strength would decrease by a factor of about 4, which is 1/4. So the bond strength would be 25% of the original, which is a decrease by a factor of 4. Hmm, but none of the options have (c) as decreased by a factor of 4. Let me check the options again.

Looking at option I: (c) is halved. Option C: (c) is quadrupled. No, that's not right. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the radius of B as the sole factor, ignoring A. But that wouldn't make sense because the distance is sum of both radii.

Wait, maybe I should think about the Madelung constant, but perhaps that's complicating things. Alternatively, perhaps the question treats the radius change as the only factor, assuming that the sum of the radii is proportional to the radius of B. So if B's radius doubles, the distance between A and B doubles, leading to bond strength being 1/(2^2) = 1/4th, so a decrease by a factor of 4. But looking at the options, I don't see any option where (c) is decreased by a factor of 4. Wait, let me check all options.

Looking at the options, option J says (c) is decreased by a factor of 4. Let me see what option J says overall. Option J: (a) unchanged, (b) doubled, (c) decreased by 4, (d) quadrupled. Wait, but earlier I thought (a) would double the bond strength. So option J's (a) is unchanged, which contradicts my initial thought. So perhaps I'm wrong about part (a).

Wait, maybe I should re-express the bond strength formula. Let me denote the original charges as Q_A and Q_B, and their radii as r_A and r_B. So the bond strength S is proportional to (Q_A * Q_B) / (r_A + r_B)^2.

Part (a): Charge on A doubles. So new Q_A' = 2Q_A. So new S_a = (2Q_A * Q_B) / (r_A + r_B)^2 = 2 * (Q_A Q_B)/(r_A + r_B)^2 = 2S. So bond strength doubles. So part (a) is doubled.

Part (b): Both charges double. So Q_A' = 2Q_A, Q_B' = 2Q_B. So S_b = (2Q_A * 2Q_B) / (r_A + r_B)^2 = 4 * (Q_A Q_B)/(r_A + r_B)^2 = 4S. So bond strength quadruples. So part (b) is increased by 4.

Part (c): Radius of B doubles. So new r_B' = 2r_B. New S_c = (Q_A Q_B) / (r_A + 2r_B)^2. Let me compute the ratio S_c/S = [1] / [(r_A + 2r_B)^2 / (r_A + r_B)^2]. So S_c = S * (r_A + r_B)^2 / (r_A + 2r_B)^2.

Now, depending on the relative sizes of r_A and r_B, this ratio changes. For example, if r_A is much smaller than r_B (like in NaCl, where Na+ has a smaller radius than Cl-), then r_A + r_B ≈ r_B, and r_A + 2r_B ≈ 2r_B. So S_c ≈ S*(r_B^2)/(4r_B^2) )= S*(1/4). So the bond strength decreases by a factor of 4.

But if r_A is comparable to r_B, the factor changes. For example, if r_A = r_B, then original r = 2r_B, new r = r_A + 2r_B = r_B + 2r_B = 3r_B. So (r_A + r_B) = 2r_B, (r_A + 2r_B)=3r_B. So ratio is (2r_B)^2/(3r_B)^2 = 4/9. So S_c = S*(4/9) ≈ 0.444 S. So bond strength decreases to about 44.4% of original, which is a decrease by a factor of about 2.25.

But the question doesn't specify, so perhaps it's assuming that B's radius is the dominant one, so the bond strength decreases by a factor of 4. But looking at the options, none have (c) as decreased by 4 except option J. Wait, option J says (c) is decreased by a factor of 4. But let me check what the options say for each part.

Option I: (a) doubled, (b) quadrupled, (c) halved, (d) decreased by 4.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me re-examine each option.

Option I: (a) Bond strength is doubled, (b) Bond strength is quadrupled, (c) Bond strength is halved, (d) Bond strength is decreased by a factor of 4.

Wait, but according to our analysis, part (c) would decrease by a factor of 4 if r_A is much smaller than r_B. So for option I, (c) is halved, which would be incorrect if the factor is 4. So perhaps the correct option doesn't exist yet. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in part (c).

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the radius of B only, i.e., the distance is just r_B. That can't be right because the distance is the sum of the two radii. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering only one ion's radius, but that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is simplifying the model, considering the radius as the distance between the ions, which would be r_A + r_B. So if only r_B doubles, the distance becomes r_A + 2r_B. Let me take r_A = 1 and r_B = 1 for simplicity. So original distance is 2, new distance is 3. So the denominator becomes (3)^2 =9, original is 4. So bond strength is (1/9)/(1/4) = 4/9 of original, which is about 0.444, so a decrease by a factor of about 2.25. But none of the options reflect that exactly.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering that the radius of B is the only factor, and assuming r_A is zero, which isn't realistic, but let's see. If r_A is zero, then original distance is r_B, new distance is 2r_B. So bond strength would be (1/(2r_B)^2) / (1/r_B^2) )= 1/4. So a decrease by a factor of 4. So if the option has (c) as decreased by 4, that would fit. Looking again at option J: (c) is decreased by a factor of 4.

So, putting all together:

(a) Doubles the charge on A → bond strength doubles.

(b) Both charges doubled → bond strength quadruples.

(c) Radius of B doubles → bond strength decreases by 4 (if r_A is zero, but realistically, it depends. Maybe the question assumes this.)

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the question's options don't have any correct one, but among the options, perhaps option I is the best fit for (a) and (b), but (c) in option I is halved, which doesn't align with my calculation of a 4x decrease.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in part (a). Let me think again. The bond strength is proportional to the product of the charges. So if charge on A doubles, the product becomes 2*Q_A * Q_B, which is twice the original. So bond strength doubles. So (a) is correct as doubled.

Now, looking at the options, which ones have (a) as doubled?

Option A: (a) same → no.

Option B: (a) doubled → yes.

Option C: (a) halved → no.

Option D: (a) quadrupled → no.

Option E: (a) halved → no.

Option F: (a) quadrupled → no.

Option G: (a) tripled → no.

Option H: (a) halved → no.

Option I: (a) doubled → yes.

Option J: (a) unchanged → no.

So options B and I have (a) as doubled.

Now, part (b) is both charges doubled. So bond strength quadruples.

Looking at options B and I:

Option B: (b) remains same → no.

Option I: (b) quadrupled → yes.

So option I has (b) correct.

Now, part (c): radius of B doubles → bond strength decreases by a factor of 4 (if r_A is zero) or less.

Looking at option I, (c) is halved. That doesn't fit, unless my assumption is wrong. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in part (c).

Wait, perhaps the radius of B is doubled, but the problem states 'simultaneously doubling the radius of B' in part (c). So the only change is B's radius. So the bond strength would be S * (r_A + r_B)^2 / (r_A + 2r_B)^2.

But without knowing r_A and r_B, perhaps the question is simplifying and saying that the radius of B is the only factor, leading to a decrease by a factor of 4, so bond strength becomes 1/4th. So in that case, part (c) would decrease by a factor of 4.

Looking at option J: (c) decreased by 4.

But option J says (a) is unchanged, which is wrong because (a) should double. So only options I and B have (a) correct. Option I's (c) is halved, which doesn't fit my initial analysis.

Wait, perhaps I should think about how the radius affects the bond strength. The bond strength is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between ions. So if the radius of B doubles, the distance increases, so the bond strength decreases.

But the exact factor depends on the sum. For example, if r_A is 1 and r_B is 1, the distance becomes 3 when B's radius doubles, so the bond strength is (2/3)^2 = 4/9 of the original. That's a decrease by a factor of about 2.25, which isn't any of the options.

Alternatively, if r_A is 0, then the distance doubles, leading to a decrease by 4. But that's an extreme case.

Looking at the options, option I says (c) is halved. So maybe the question is considering that the radius of B is the only factor, making the distance double, leading to bond strength halved (since 1/(2)^2 = 1/4, but that would be a decrease by a factor of 4, not halved). Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the bond strength is inversely proportional to the radius, not the square. No, Coulomb's law is inverse square.

Wait, another approach: the options may have (c) as halved, which would mean a change in bond strength by a factor of 1/2. How would that happen?

If the radius of B doubles, and the sum of the radii increases by a factor of 1.5 (e.g., r_A=1, r_B=1 → sum=2; after doubling B, sum=3 → increase by 1.5). Then, the bond strength would be (1/1.5)^2 ≈ 0.444, which is a decrease by a factor of about 2.25. But that's not matching any option.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the radius of B as the sole radius, ignoring A. So if B's radius doubles, the distance becomes 2r_B, leading to bond strength being 1/(2)^2 = 1/4. So bond strength decreases by 4. But none of the options for (c) have that except option J, which has (a) as unchanged, which is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the radius of B is halved, but no, the question says doubled.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option I, where (c) is halved. But that would imply that the bond strength decreases by a factor of 2, which would happen if the sum of the radii increases by a factor of sqrt(2). For example, if r_A=1, r_B=1, sum=2 → after doubling B, sum=3. 3/2 = 1.5, which is more than sqrt(2) (~1.414). So that would lead to a decrease by (1.5)^2 = 2.25, which is more than a factor of 2. So perhaps option I isn't correct.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to think differently. The bond strength is proportional to (charge product)/(radius sum squared). So for each part:

(a) Charge on A doubles → bond strength doubles. So part (a) is correct in options B and I.

(b) Both charges double → bond strength quadruples. So part (b) is correct in option I.

(c) Radius of B doubles → bond strength decreases by a factor of (r_sum_new / r_sum_old)^2. Without specific values, perhaps the question assumes that the radius of B is the only factor, so the sum doubles, leading to a factor of 4 decrease. But none of the options for (c) have that except option J, which has (a) as unchanged, which is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the radius of B is the same as the sum, which doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the radius of B is the only factor, and the distance doubles, leading to a decrease by 4. So (c) would be decreased by 4.

Looking at option J:

(a) unchanged → no, because I think (a) should double.

(b) increased by 4 → correct.

(c) decreased by 4 → correct.

(d) decreased by 4 → but I'm not sure about (d) yet.

Wait, but (a) should double, so option J can't be correct.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in part (c). Let me think again. If the radius of B doubles, and the sum of the radii increases, the bond strength decreases. But without knowing r_A, it's hard to calculate exactly. Maybe the best approach is to look for the option where (a) is doubled, (b) is quadrupled, and (c) is halved, which would be option I.

Wait, but according to my earlier calculation, (c) would decrease by a factor of 4 if r_A is zero, which isn't realistic, but perhaps the question expects that. Alternatively, perhaps the question treats the radius of B as the main factor, leading to a factor of 4 decrease, but that's not matching any option except J, which has (a) unchanged.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to proceed to part (d) and see if that helps.

(d) Simultaneously doubling the radius of A and B. So both radii double. The sum of the radii becomes (2r_A + 2r_B) = 2(r_A + r_B). So the new distance is twice the original. The bond strength is inversely proportional to (distance)^2, so the new bond strength is S' = S * (original distance^2) / (new distance^2) = S * (r_A + r_B)^2 / (2(r_A + r_B))^2 = S * 1/4. So bond strength decreases by a factor of 4. So part (d) would be decreased by a factor of 4.

Looking at the options, which option has (d) as decreased by 4?

Option I: (d) decreased by a factor of 4 → yes.

So, putting it all together:

(a) doubled → options B and I.

(b) quadrupled → option I.

(c) decreased by a factor of 4 → option J, but J's (a) is wrong.

Wait, but according to my analysis, part (c) would decrease by 4 if r_A is zero, but realistically, it's more complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the bond strength is inversely proportional to each radius individually, not the sum. That would be incorrect, but perhaps that's what the question assumes.

If the bond strength is inversely proportional to each radius, then for part (c), doubling B's radius would make the bond strength proportional to 1/(2r_B)² = 1/(4r_B²), so the bond strength would be 1/4th, a decrease by 4. So (c) would be decreased by 4.

Looking back at the options, option J says (c) is decreased by 4. But option J's (a) is unchanged, which is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is option H. Let me check option H:

H: (a) halved, (b) same, (c) doubled, (d) quadrupled. No, that doesn't fit.

Option D: (a) quadrupled, (b) halved, (c) doubled, (d) halved. No.

Option F: (a) quadrupled, (b) octupled, (c) halved, (d) same. No.

Option G: (a) tripled, (b) sextupled, (c) same, (d) decreased by 8. No.

So, perhaps the correct answer is option I, even though (c) doesn't align with my initial analysis, because the other parts fit. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in part (c).

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question is considering that the radius of B is the only factor, meaning the distance is just r_B. So if r_B doubles, the distance becomes 2r_B, leading to bond strength being 1/(2r_B)^2 = 1/(4r_B²), which is 1/4 of original. So (c) would be decreased by 4.

But looking at the options, only option J has (c) as decreased by 4, but option J's (a) is unchanged, which I think is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option I, and I'm overcomplicating part (c). Let me think: option I says (a) doubled, (b) quadrupled, (c) halved, (d) decreased by 4.

Wait, but according to my analysis, (d) would be decreased by 4, which matches option I's (d). So perhaps the correct answer is option I.

Wait, but earlier for part (c), I thought it should decrease by 4, but option I says (c) is halved. That's conflicting. Maybe I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the bond strength is inversely proportional to each radius, not the sum. So if B's radius doubles, bond strength is inversely proportional to (2r_B), leading to 1/2 the bond strength. So (c) would be halved. That would align with option I's (c).

But that's not correct because the distance is the sum of the radii, not just one of them. So I'm a bit stuck, but perhaps the intended answer is option I, given that (a) and (b) fit, and (d) fits as decreased by 4, even though (c) might not align with the actual calculation.

Wait, but if the question assumes that each radius contributes independently, then for part (c), the bond strength would be inversely proportional to r_B, so doubling r_B would halve the bond strength. So (c) would be halved. That would make option I correct.

So, putting it all together:

(a) Charge on A doubles → bond strength doubles.

(b) Both charges double → bond strength quadruples.

(c) Radius of B doubles → bond strength halves.

(d) Both radii double → bond strength decreases by 4.

Which matches option I.
</think>

The question examines how changes in charge and radius affect the strength of an ionic bond, based on Coulomb's law. The bond strength is proportional to the product of the charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the ions (sum of their radii). Each part of the question is analyzed as follows:

1. **Part (a): Doubling the charge on A**  
   The bond strength is proportional to the product of the charges. Doubling the charge on A doubles the product, so the bond strength doubles.

2. **Part (b): Simultaneously doubling the charges on A and B**  
   Doubling both charges increases the product by a factor of 4, so the bond strength quadruples.

3. **Part (c): Doubling the radius of B**  
   The bond strength is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the ions. If only B's radius doubles, the distance increases, reducing the bond strength. Assuming the radius of B dominates, the bond strength decreases by a factor of 4. However, the question simplifies this to a halving of the bond strength.

4. **Part (d): Simultaneously doubling the radii of A and B**  
   Doubling both radii increases the distance by a factor of 2, reducing the bond strength by a factor of 4.

Among the options, **option I** aligns with the analysis for parts (a) and (b) and assumes the bond strength is halved in part (c) due to the simplified model. While part (c) might not perfectly align with the detailed calculation, option I is the best fit overall.

**Answer: I**
