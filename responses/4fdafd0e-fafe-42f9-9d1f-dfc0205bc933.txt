Okay, so I have this problem about a discounted note, and I need to figure out the proceeds Jane Carpov held. Let me try to break this down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on financial math, but I'll give it a shot.

The note is a 60-day note for $4200 with an interest rate of 5%. It was discounted 25 days before maturity at 6%. I need to find the proceeds Jane received when she discounted the note.

First, let me understand what's happening here. Jane has a note that will mature in 60 days, and she's discounting it 25 days before it matures. So, how much time is left when she discounts it? If it's 25 days before maturity, that means there are 60 - 25 = 35 days left until the note matures. So the discounting happens when there's 35 days remaining on the note.

Wait, no, actually, when a note is discounted, the discount is calculated based on the remaining time until maturity, right? So if the note was taken for 60 days and she discounted it 25 days before it matures, that would mean she discounted it when there were 60 - 25 = 35 days left. So the discount period is 35 days.

But wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me clarify: the note is held for 60 days. The discounting occurs 25 days before the maturity date. So the maturity is at day 60, so discounting is done at day 60 -25 = day 35. So the time from the discounting date to maturity is 25 days? Or is it 35 days? Hmm, maybe I got that wrong.

Wait, no. If the note was held for 60 days, and she discounts it 25 days before it matures, that means when she discounts it, there are 25 days left until maturity. So the discount period is 25 days. Because she's discounting it 25 days before it's due, so the note would have been outstanding for 60 days, but she's discounting it at day 60 -25 = day 35. Then from day 35 to day 60 is 25 days. So the discount is calculated on 25 days, not 35. Hmm, that makes more sense.

Wait, this is confusing. Let me think again. Suppose the note is for 60 days, so it's due at day 60. If Jane discounts it 25 days before it's due, that would be at day 60 -25 = day 35. So the time remaining when she discounts it is 25 days. So the discount is calculated over 25 days. That seems correct.

So, the note's face value is $4200, and it's bearing interest at 5%. So the interest is calculated on the principal for the 60 days. But when Jane discounts it, she's getting the present value of the note, which includes the interest for the remaining 25 days, discounted at 6%.

Wait, no. The interest on the note is 5% for 60 days. But when she discounts it, she's effectively selling the note before it matures, and the discount is based on the remaining time at a higher rate (6%). So perhaps the interest is calculated on the remaining time, but the discount rate is 6%.

Wait, maybe I should approach this step by step. Let's outline the steps:

1. Determine the maturity value of the note.
2. Determine the number of days remaining when the note is discounted.
3. Calculate the discount amount using the discount rate.
4. Subtract the discount from the maturity value to get the proceeds.

First, the maturity value. The note is for $4200 at 5% for 60 days. The interest can be calculated using simple interest: I = P * r * t.

Here, P = $4200, r = 5% per annum, which is 0.05. Time is 60 days. I need to convert days to years because the rate is annual. 60 days is 60/360 = 1/6 of a year, assuming a 360-day year, which is common in finance.

So, interest I = 4200 * 0.05 * (60/360) = 4200 * 0.05 * (1/6) = 4200 * 0.008333... ≈ 4200 * 0.008333 = let's calculate that.

4200 * 0.008333 is the same as 4200 * (1/120) because 0.008333 is 1/120. So 4200 / 120 = 35. So the interest is $35. Thus, the maturity value is principal + interest = 4200 + 35 = $4235.

Wait, that's the maturity value. So when the note is due, it's worth $4235.

Now, Jane discounts this note 25 days before maturity. So she's getting money before the note matures. The discount is calculated on the remaining 25 days at 6% discount rate.

Wait, but the discount rate is 6%, which is the annual rate. So I need to find the discount amount for 25 days at 6%.

The formula for discount is D = M * r_discount * t, where M is the maturity value, r_discount is the discount rate, and t is the time in years.

So, D = 4235 * 0.06 * (25/360). Let's compute that.

First, 25/360 is approximately 0.069444 years.

So D = 4235 * 0.06 * 0.069444.

Let me compute 0.06 * 0.069444 first. 0.06 * 0.069444 ≈ 0.00416664.

Then, D ≈ 4235 * 0.00416664.

Let me calculate that: 4235 * 0.00416664.

Well, 4235 * 0.004 = 16.94.

4235 * 0.00016664 ≈ 4235 * 0.00016664 ≈ approximately 0.705.

So adding together, 16.94 + 0.705 ≈ 17.645.

So the discount D is approximately $17.65.

Therefore, the proceeds Jane receives would be the maturity value minus the discount: 4235 - 17.65 ≈ $4217.35.

Looking at the options, option G is $4217.35, so that's the answer.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

Maturity value: 4200 * 0.05 * (60/360) = 4200 * 0.008333 = 35. So total maturity value is 4235. That's correct.

Discount period: 25 days, so 25/360 = 0.069444 years.

Discount rate is 6%, so 0.06 * 0.069444 ≈ 0.00416664.

4235 * 0.00416664 = let me compute it more accurately.

4235 * 0.00416664:

First, 4235 * 0.004 = 16.94.

4235 * 0.00016664 = let's compute 4235 * 0.0001 = 0.4235.

4235 * 0.00006664 ≈ 4235 * 0.00006664 ≈ approximately 0.282.

So 0.4235 + 0.282 ≈ 0.7055.

So total D ≈ 16.94 + 0.7055 ≈ 17.6455 ≈ $17.65.

Thus, proceeds = 4235 - 17.65 = 4217.35.

Yes, that's correct. So the answer is G: $4217.35.
</think>

The maturity value of the note is calculated by adding the interest to the principal. The interest is $35, making the maturity value $4235. The discount is calculated on this maturity value for 25 days at 6%, resulting in a discount of approximately $17.65. Subtracting this discount from the maturity value gives the proceeds as $4217.35.
