Okay, so I've got this problem about finding the voltage across a capacitor at a specific time. Hmm, let's see what it's asking. The capacitor is 0.01 microfarads, which I should convert to farads. I remember that 1 microfarad is 1e-6 farads, so 0.01 microfarads would be 0.01 * 1e-6 = 1e-8 farads. Got that down.

The time given is t = 0.25 microseconds. Wait, microseconds are 1e-6 seconds, so 0.25 microseconds is 0.25e-6 seconds. I need to keep track of the units because that's crucial for calculations.

The problem has three parts, each with a different current through the capacitor. Let's go through each one by one.

Starting with part (a): the current is 0.2 sin(2π * 1e6 t) A. Oh, right, this is a sinusoidal current. The general formula for voltage across a capacitor is V = integral of I(t) dt divided by capacitance C. So I need to integrate the current function over time from 0 to 0.25e-6 seconds and then divide by C.

Let me set up the integral. The integral of 0.2 sin(2π * 1e6 t) dt. The integral of sin(ax) is -(1/a) cos(ax) + constant. So integrating 0.2 sin(2π *1e6 t) dt gives (0.2 / (2π * 1e6)) * (-cos(2π *1e6 t)) ) evaluated from 0 to t=0.25e-6.

Wait, let's compute that step by step. The integral from 0 to t is [ (0.2 / (2π *1e6 )) * (-cos(2π *1e6 t) + cos(0)) ) ].

Plugging in t=0.25e-6: 0.25e-6 * 1e6 = 0.25. So 2π * 0.25 = π/2 radians. Cos(π/2) is zero. And cos(0) is 1.

So the integral becomes (0.2/(2π *1e6)) * (0 + 1) = 0.2/(2π *1e6) * (1) = 0.1/(π *1e6).

But wait, no, let's compute the integral correctly. The integral is (0.2/(2π *1e6)) * [ -cos(2π *1e6 t) ] from 0 to t. So at t, it's -cos(2π*1e6 * t), and at 0, it's -cos(0) = -1. So subtracting, it's [ -cos(2π*1e6 t) + 1 ].

So the integral evaluates to (0.2/(2π*1e6)) * [1 - cos(2π*1e6 t)].

At t=0.25e-6, 2π*1e6 * 0.25e-6 = 2π * 0.25 = π/2. Cos(π/2)=0, so the integral is (0.2/(2π*1e6)) * (1 - 0) = 0.2/(2π*1e6) = 0.1/(π *1e6).

Calculating that value: 0.1 / (3.1416 * 1e6) ≈ 0.1 / 3.1416e6 ≈ 3.183e-8 Coulombs.

Then, voltage V = Q/C = (3.183e-8 C) / (1e-8 F) = 3.183 V. Hmm, but the options don't seem to have exactly that. Wait, let me double-check my calculations.

Wait, 0.2/(2π*1e6) = 0.1/(π *1e6) ≈ 0.1/(3.1416e6) ≈ 3.183e-8 C. Then V = 3.183e-8 / 1e-8 = 3.183 V. But looking at the options, the closest is option A for part (a) as 3.78 V, which is higher. Maybe I made a mistake in the integration limits.

Wait, maybe I should consider the phase more carefully. Alternatively, perhaps the integral is from 0 to t, so the correct expression is (0.2/(2π *1e6)) * (1 - cos(2π *1e6 t)).

Wait, 2π *1e6 * 0.25e-6 = 2π *0.25 = π/2. So 1 - cos(π/2) = 1-0=1.

So the integral is (0.2/(2π *1e6)) * 1 = 0.1/(π *1e6) ≈ 3.183e-8 C.

Then, V = 3.183e-8 / 1e-8 = 3.183 V. But the options don't have this. The closest is option A: 3.78 V. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial step. Alternatively, maybe the integration includes the initial condition differently.

Wait, perhaps I forgot that the integral is the charge, and the initial voltage is V(0) = 0.6 V. Because the capacitor has an initial voltage, so the total voltage would be the integral plus the initial voltage?

Wait, wait, the problem states ν(0) = 0.6 V. Oh, right! So the voltage at t=0 is 0.6 V, which is the initial condition. So when calculating the voltage at t, it's V(t) = V(0) + (1/C) ∫ I(t) dt from 0 to t.

Ah, that's a crucial point I missed. So the integral gives the change in voltage, and the initial voltage is 0.6 V.

So for part (a), I need to compute V(t) = 0.6 V + (1/C) * ∫ I(t) dt from 0 to t.

But wait, is that correct? Let me think. The voltage across a capacitor is the integral of the current over time divided by capacitance, plus the initial voltage. So yes, correct.

So in my earlier calculation, I got the integral as ~3.183e-8 C. So voltage change is 3.183e-8 C / 1e-8 F = 3.183 V. So total V(t) is 0.6 + 3.183 ≈ 3.783 V. That's approximately 3.78 V, which matches option A's (a) 3.78 V.

Alright, that makes sense now. So part (a) is about 3.78 V.

Moving on to part (b): the current is 0.2 e^(-10^7 t) A. Wait, the exponent is written as (10)7 t, perhaps it's 10^7 t? So I(t) = 0.2 e^(-1e7 t) A.

Again, V(t) = V(0) + (1/C) ∫ I(t) dt from 0 to t.

So integrating 0.2 e^(-1e7 t) dt from 0 to 0.25e-6.

The integral of e^(-kt) is (-1/k) e^(-kt), so:

∫ I(t) dt = ∫ 0.2 e^(-1e7 t) dt = 0.2 * [ (-1/(1e7)) e^(-1e7 t) ] from 0 to t.

Evaluating from 0 to t:

= 0.2 * [ (-1/1e7) e^(-1e7 t) + (1/1e7) e^(0) ) ]

= 0.2 * (1/(1e7)) [1 - e^(-1e7 t) ]

So at t=0.25e-6 s:

Compute 1e7 * 0.25e-6 = 1e7 * 2.5e-7 = 2.5. So e^(-2.5) ≈ 0.082085.

Thus, the integral becomes 0.2 * (1e-7) [1 - 0.082085] = 0.2e-7 * 0.917915 ≈ 0.2e-7 * 0.9179 ≈ 1.8358e-8 C.

Then, the voltage change is 1.8358e-8 C / 1e-8 F = 1.8358 V.

Adding the initial 0.6 V, V(t) = 0.6 + 1.8358 ≈ 2.4358 V. Approximately 2.44 V, which matches option A's (b) 2.44 V.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A's (b) is 2.44 V, which is what I have. So part (b) is 2.44 V.

Now part (c): current is 0.2 A for 0 ≤ t ≤ 3 μs. So it's a DC current, 0.2 A constant.

Again, V(t) = V(0) + (1/C) ∫ I(t) dt from 0 to t.

Since I(t) is constant, the integral is I*t. So the voltage change is (0.2 * t) / C.

t is 0.25e-6 s, so 0.2 * 0.25e-6 = 0.05e-6 = 5e-8 C.

Divided by C=1e-8 F: 5e-8 / 1e-8 = 5 V.

Adding initial voltage 0.6 V, V(t)=0.6 +5 =5.6 V.

So part (c) is 5.6 V, which matches option A's (c) 5.6 V.

Looking at the options, option A is (a) 3.78 V, (b) 2.44 V, (c)5.6 V. So the correct option is A.

The voltage across the capacitor is calculated for each case by integrating the current over time, dividing by capacitance, and adding the initial voltage of 0.6 V. 

For part (a), the sinusoidal current integrates to approximately 3.78 V when adding the initial voltage. For part (b), the exponential decay current results in about 2.44 V. For part (c), the constant current leads to 5.6 V. These values match option A.
