Okay, so I have this thermodynamics problem here. The question is about estimating the change in Gibbs function, ΔG, for a reaction when going from the Earth's crust to its core. The given parameters are pressure and temperature at the core, along with changes in volume and entropy. Hmm, I remember Gibbs free energy change is calculated using the formula ΔG = VΔP + TΔS. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the problem states that the pressure at the core is 3 × 10^6 atm. Wait, that's a really high pressure compared to atmospheric pressure. The temperature is 4000°C, which is quite hot. The changes given are ΔV = 1 cm³/mol and ΔS = 2.1 J/(K·mol). Oh, wait, the units for volume are in cm³, but I think I need to convert that to m³ because the standard unit for pressure in pascals is m⁻³. Or wait, maybe I can work with cm³ if I adjust the pressure units accordingly. Let me clarify.

Wait, the formula ΔG = VΔP + TΔS requires all terms to be in compatible units. So, I need to make sure that the units for V and P are the same. Since ΔV is given in cm³/mol, perhaps I should convert the pressure from atm to some unit that works with cm³. Alternatively, I could convert cm³ to m³. Let me think about the conversion factors.

I know that 1 m³ = 10^6 liters, and 1 liter is 1000 cm³, so 1 m³ = 10^9 cm³. So, 1 cm³ = 1e-9 m³. Alternatively, pressure in Pascals is N/m². Hmm, but maybe it's easier to convert the pressure from atm to some other unit that pairs with cm³. Let's see, I remember that 1 L·atm is approximately 101.325 J. Since 1 L is 1000 cm³, 1 cm³·atm is about 0.101325 J.

Wait, that might be a useful conversion. So, if I have ΔV in cm³ and ΔP in atm, then multiplying them would give me cm³·atm, which I can convert to J using that factor.

So, the formula ΔG = VΔP + TΔS. Let's plug in the numbers.

ΔV = 1 cm³/mol, ΔP = 3e6 atm.

So, VΔP = 1 cm³ * 3e6 atm = 3e6 cm³·atm.

Now, converting cm³·atm to Joules: since 1 cm³·atm ≈ 0.101325 J, so 3e6 * 0.101325 ≈ 303,975 J/mol, which is about 304 kJ/mol.

Wait, but wait, that's a big number. Hmm, but let me check the temperature part.

Temperature T is 4000°C, which is 4000 + 273.15 = 4273.15 K. ΔS is 2.1 J/(K·mol), so TΔS = 4273.15 * 2.1 ≈ let's calculate that. 4000 * 2.1 is 8400, and 273.15 * 2.1 ≈ 573.615, so total is about 8973.615 J/mol, which is approximately 8974 J/mol or about 8.97 kJ/mol.

So now, adding the two parts: VΔP ≈ 304 kJ/mol and TΔS ≈ 9 kJ/mol. Wait, wait, but hold on. Gibbs free energy change is ΔG = VΔP - SΔT? Or is it TΔS? Wait, no, the correct formula is ΔG = VΔP - SΔT, but wait, no, wait, the Gibbs equation when considering pressure and temperature changes is ΔG = VΔP - SΔT. Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me check.

Wait, the general formula for the Gibbs free energy change under non-standard conditions is ΔG = ΔG° + VΔP - SΔT. But in this problem, are we considering ΔG° as zero? Or is it a general ΔG? Hmm, the problem says to estimate the change in Gibbs function when going from crust to core, so perhaps it's assuming standard conditions, and the changes are due to pressure and temperature. Alternatively, maybe the formula is ΔG = VΔP + TΔS. Wait, that can't be right because TΔS would be in J/mol·K * K, which is J/mol, and VΔP would be in cm³·atm, which we converted to J. So, perhaps the formula is ΔG = VΔP - TΔS? Or is it the other way around? I think I might be mixing up the formula.

Wait, no, the formula for Gibbs free energy change when pressure and temperature change is ΔG = VΔP - SΔT. Because the differential form is dG = VdP - SdT. So, for a finite change, ΔG = VΔP - SΔT.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it says to use ΔV and ΔS. So, perhaps ΔG = ΔV ΔP - ΔS ΔT. Because when you integrate dG = V dP - S dT, you get ΔG = V ΔP - S ΔT, assuming V and S are constant, which is a reasonable approximation for small changes.

So, in this case, ΔV is 1 cm³/mol, ΔS is 2.1 J/(K·mol), ΔP is 3e6 atm, and ΔT is 4000°C, which is 4273 K.

Wait, but let me get the signs right. When going from crust to core, the pressure increases and temperature increases. So, the change in pressure is from atmospheric pressure (say 1 atm) to 3e6 atm, so ΔP = 3e6 - 1 ≈ 3e6 atm. Similarly, temperature increases from, say, surface temperature (maybe around 25°C, 298 K) to 4000°C (4273 K), so ΔT = 4273 - 298 ≈ 3975 K.

But wait, the problem might just be giving the core conditions, so perhaps we're considering the change as going from crust (P=1 atm, T=298 K) to core (P=3e6 atm, T=4273 K). So ΔP = 3e6 - 1 ≈ 3e6 atm, ΔT = 4273 - 298 ≈ 3975 K.

So, using ΔG = ΔV ΔP - ΔS ΔT.

Let me plug in the numbers.

First, compute ΔV ΔP:

ΔV = 1 cm³/mol = 1e-6 m³/mol (since 1 m³ = 1e6 L, 1 cm³ = 1e-6 m³? Wait, no, 1 m³ = 1e3 L, 1 L = 1e3 cm³, so 1 m³ = 1e3 * 1e3 = 1e6 L. Wait, no, wait, 1 m³ = 1,000,000 liters? No, that can't be right. Wait, 1 m³ is (100 cm)^3 = 1e6 cm³. So, 1 cm³ = 1e-6 m³. So, ΔV is 1e-6 m³/mol.

But pressure is given in atm. To use SI units, perhaps I should convert pressure to Pascals (Pa), where 1 Pa = 1 N/m². Also, 1 atm = 101325 Pa.

So, ΔP = 3e6 atm * 101325 Pa/atm = 3e6 * 1.01325e5 Pa = 3.03975e11 Pa.

Wait, that's a huge pressure. Now, ΔV is 1e-6 m³/mol. So, VΔP = 1e-6 m³ * 3.03975e11 Pa = 3.03975e5 N·m/mol = 303,975 J/mol ≈ 304 kJ/mol.

Next, compute TΔS: T is 4273 K, ΔS is 2.1 J/(K·mol). So, TΔS = 4273 * 2.1 ≈ 8973.3 J/mol ≈ 8.97 kJ/mol.

So, ΔG = VΔP - SΔT = 304,000 J - 8,973 J ≈ 295,027 J/mol ≈ 295 kJ/mol.

Wait, but that's approximately 295 kJ/mol. Looking at the options, I see option I is 291.7 kJ/mol, which is close. Hmm. But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation steps.

Wait, let me double-check the units. Because when I converted 1 cm³ to m³, I got 1e-6 m³, which is correct. Pressure in Pa is 3e6 atm * 101325 Pa/atm = 3e6 * 1.01325e5 = 3.03975e11 Pa. So VΔP is 1e-6 m³ * 3.03975e11 Pa = 3.03975e5 J/mol.

Wait, 3.03975e5 J is 303,975 J, which is 303.975 kJ.

Then, TΔS is 4273 K * 2.1 J/(K·mol) = 8973.3 J/mol, which is 8.973 kJ/mol.

So, ΔG = 303,975 J - 8,973 J = 295,002 J ≈ 295,000 J, which is 295 kJ/mol.

Looking at the options, option I is 291.7 kJ/mol, which is very close. Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the pressure conversion. Let me check that again.

Wait, 3e6 atm * 101325 Pa/atm = 3,000,000 * 101,325 = 303,975,000,000 Pa. Oh wait, wait, that can't be right. Wait, 1 atm is 101,325 Pa, so 3e6 atm is 3e6 * 101,325 = 303,975,000 Pa. So, 3.03975e8 Pa.

Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me recalculate that:

3e6 atm = 3,000,000 atm.

1 atm = 101,325 Pa.

So, 3e6 * 101,325 = 3e6 * 1.01325e5 = 3 * 1.01325e11 = 3.03975e11 Pa? Wait, no, 3e6 * 1e5 is 3e11, so 3e6 * 1.01325e5 = 3.03975e11 Pa. Wait, but that's 303,975,000,000 Pa, which is correct.

Now, ΔV is 1 cm³/mol = 1e-6 m³/mol.

So, VΔP = 1e-6 m³ * 3.03975e11 Pa = 3.03975e5 J/mol = 303,975 J/mol ≈ 304 kJ/mol.

TΔS = 4273 K * 2.1 J/(K·mol) = 8,973.3 J/mol ≈ 8.97 kJ/mol.

So, ΔG = 304 kJ - 8.97 kJ ≈ 295.03 kJ/mol.

Looking at the options, the closest is I: 291.7 kJ/mol. Hmm, but why the difference? Maybe I made a calculation error in TΔS.

Wait, let me compute 4273 * 2.1 more accurately.

4273 * 2 = 8546.

4273 * 0.1 = 427.3.

Total: 8546 + 427.3 = 8973.3 J/mol, which is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the pressure change is from crust to core, so the pressure difference is 3e6 atm - 1 atm ≈ 3e6 atm, but maybe the problem assumes that the pressure change is 3e6 atm, ignoring the 1 atm. Let me check the problem statement again.

The problem says, "the pressure and temperature at the center of the earth are 3 × 10^6 atm and 4000°C respectively." So, it's the change from crust (P=1 atm, T=25°C) to core (P=3e6 atm, T=4000°C). So, the change in pressure is 3e6 - 1 ≈ 3e6 atm, and change in temperature is 4000 - 25 ≈ 3975°C, which is 4273 K.

Wait, but in the formula, ΔG = VΔP - SΔT. So, using these values, the result is about 295 kJ/mol, but the option I is 291.7, which is close. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects a different approach.

Wait, another approach: using the relation ΔG = VΔP + TΔS. Wait, but that would be if the formula were ΔG = VΔP + TΔS. But earlier I thought the correct formula is ΔG = VΔP - SΔT. Let me confirm.

From thermodynamics, the Gibbs free energy change at constant temperature is ΔG = VΔP - SΔT. Wait, no, more accurately, the differential is dG = V dP - S dT. So, for a process where both P and T change, ΔG = V ΔP - S ΔT.

So, yes, the formula is ΔG = VΔP - SΔT.

But in the problem statement, the given values are ΔV and ΔS. So, ΔV is the change in volume, and ΔS is the change in entropy.

Wait, but wait, in the formula, V is molar volume change, and S is entropy change? Or is it the partial molar volume and entropy? I think for a reaction, ΔG is calculated using the changes in volume and entropy for the system.

So, using the values provided: ΔV = 1 cm³/mol, ΔS = 2.1 J/(K·mol).

So, ΔG = (ΔV)ΔP - (ΔS)ΔT.

Wait, but wait, the formula uses the change in pressure and temperature. So, ΔP is the change in pressure, and ΔT is the change in temperature.

So, let's compute each term again.

ΔP = 3e6 atm - 1 atm ≈ 3e6 atm (since 3e6 is much larger than 1 atm).

ΔT = 4000°C - 25°C ≈ 3975°C, which is 3975 K? Wait, no, wait, 0°C is 273.15 K, so 4000°C is 4273.15 K, and 25°C is 298.15 K. So, ΔT = 4273.15 - 298.15 = 3975 K.

So, now, ΔG = (ΔV in m³/mol) * (ΔP in Pascals) - (ΔS in J/(K·mol)) * (ΔT in K).

First, convert ΔV from cm³/mol to m³/mol: 1 cm³ = 1e-6 m³, so ΔV = 1e-6 m³/mol.

ΔP = 3e6 atm * 101325 Pa/atm = 3e6 * 1.01325e5 = 3.03975e11 Pa.

So, VΔP = (1e-6 m³/mol) * (3.03975e11 Pa) = 3.03975e5 J/mol = 303,975 J/mol.

Next, TΔS = (3975 K) * (2.1 J/(K·mol)) = 8347.5 J/mol.

So, ΔG = 303,975 J - 8,347.5 J = 295,627.5 J/mol ≈ 295.6 kJ/mol.

Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see 295.6 kJ/mol. The closest is option I: 291.7 kJ/mol. Hmm, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the pressure conversion or in the ΔT.

Wait, let me recheck the pressure calculation.

3e6 atm * 101325 Pa/atm = 3e6 * 101,325 = 3e6 * 1.01325e5 = 3.03975e11 Pa. So, that's correct.

ΔV = 1e-6 m³, so 1e-6 * 3.03975e11 = 3.03975e5 J = 303,975 J.

ΔS = 2.1 J/(K·mol), ΔT = 3975 K.

So, 2.1 * 3975 = let me compute that.

3975 * 2 = 7950.

3975 * 0.1 = 397.5.

Total: 7950 + 397.5 = 8347.5 J.

So, ΔG = 303,975 - 8,347.5 = 295,627.5 J, which is 295.6275 kJ/mol.

Looking at the options, the closest is I:291.7 kJ/mol. Hmm, perhaps the problem expects using temperature at core, 4000°C, not the change in temperature. Let me try that.

If I use T = 4273 K directly in TΔS, then TΔS = 4273 * 2.1 = 8973.3 J/mol.

Then, ΔG = 303,975 J - 8,973.3 J = 294,  03,975 - 8,973.3 = 295,001.7 J ≈ 295 kJ/mol.

Still, the closest option is I:291.7. Alternatively, perhaps the pressure is 3e6 atm, not the change, so ΔP is 3e6 atm, not 3e6 -1.

Wait, let's try that. If ΔP is 3e6 atm, then:

ΔP = 3e6 atm * 101325 Pa/atm = 3.03975e11 Pa.

VΔP = 1e-6 m³ * 3.03975e11 Pa = 3.03975e5 J.

ΔT = 4000°C, which is 4273 K. So, TΔS = 4273 * 2.1 = 8973.3 J.

So, ΔG = 303,975 J - 8,973.3 J = 295,001.7 J ≈ 295 kJ/mol.

Still getting the same result. Hmm.

Wait, looking at the options, option I is 291.7 kJ/mol. That's about 291,700 J. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of VΔP.

Wait, let's compute 1e-6 m³ * 3e6 atm * 101325 Pa/atm.

Wait, 3e6 atm = 3e6 * 101325 Pa = 3.03975e11 Pa.

1e-6 m³ * 3.03975e11 Pa = 3.03975e5 J, which is 303,975 J.

Hmm, perhaps the problem expects the pressure in units of bar instead of atm? Because sometimes in thermodynamics, bar is used, and 1 bar = 10^5 Pa, while 1 atm ≈ 1.01325 bar.

Wait, let me try that. If I use pressure in bar, 1 bar = 1e5 Pa.

So, 3e6 atm = 3e6 * 1.01325 bar ≈ 3,039,750 bar.

Wait, but that's a lot. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects pressure in terms of cm³·atm converted to J using 1 cm³·atm ≈ 101.325 J/L, but wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 1 L·atm ≈ 101.325 J, so 1 cm³·atm = 0.1 L·atm, which is 0.1 * 101.325 ≈ 10.1325 J.

Wait, so if ΔV is 1 cm³/mol and ΔP is 3e6 atm, then VΔP = 1 * 3e6 cm³·atm = 3e6 cm³·atm.

Convert that to J: 3e6 * 10.1325 J ≈ 30,397,500 J ≈ 30,397.5 kJ/mol. That's way too high, so I must have made a mistake in this approach.

Wait, no, wait, 1 cm³·atm is 1 cm³ * 1 atm. 1 cm³ is 1e-6 m³, and 1 atm is 101325 Pa, so 1e-6 m³ * 101325 Pa = 0.101325 J. So, 1 cm³·atm = 0.101325 J.

So, 3e6 cm³·atm = 3e6 * 0.101325 J = 303,975 J ≈ 304 kJ.

So, that's the same as before. So, the first term is 304 kJ.

Then, TΔS: 4273 K * 2.1 J/(K·mol) = 8973 J ≈ 8.97 kJ.

So, ΔG = 304 kJ - 8.97 kJ ≈ 295 kJ/mol.

But the options don't have 295 kJ/mol. The closest is option I:291.7 kJ/mol. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the pressure as 3e6 atm relative to 1 atm, so ΔP is 3e6 -1 ≈ 3e6 atm, but perhaps the problem is considering the absolute pressure, so it's 3e6 atm, not the change. Let me try that.

If ΔP = 3e6 atm, then VΔP = 1 cm³/mol * 3e6 atm = 3e6 cm³·atm.

Convert to J: 3e6 * 0.101325 J/cm³·atm = 303,975 J ≈ 304 kJ.

TΔS = 4273 K * 2.1 J/(K·mol) = 8973 J ≈ 8.97 kJ.

So, ΔG = 304,000 J - 8,973 J = 295,027 J ≈ 295 kJ/mol.

Still, no option matches. Wait, perhaps I should calculate using the given ΔV and ΔS without converting to m³ and Pa, but using cm³ and atm.

Wait, another approach: using the formula ΔG = ΔV ΔP + T ΔS.

Wait, but earlier I thought the formula was ΔG = VΔP - SΔT. Wait, perhaps I have the sign wrong. Let me think again.

In the Gibbs equation, dG = V dP - S dT. So, integrating, ΔG = V ΔP - S ΔT.

So, the formula is correct as ΔG = VΔP - SΔT.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the data given is ΔV and ΔS, so perhaps the formula should be ΔG = ΔV ΔP - ΔS ΔT.

Yes, that makes sense. So, using ΔV and ΔS as given.

So, ΔV = 1 cm³/mol, ΔP = 3e6 atm.

ΔS = 2.1 J/(K·mol), ΔT = 4000°C = 4273 K.

So, compute each term.

First term: ΔV * ΔP = 1 cm³ * 3e6 atm.

Convert this to J: 1 cm³·atm = 0.101325 J.

So, 3e6 cm³·atm = 3e6 * 0.101325 J = 303,975 J.

Second term: ΔS * ΔT = 2.1 J/(K·mol) * 4273 K = 8973.3 J.

So, ΔG = 303,975 J - 8,973.3 J ≈ 295,001.7 J ≈ 295 kJ/mol.

But the options don't have this. The closest is option I:291.7 kJ/mol. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the temperature. Let me check: 4000°C is 4000 + 273.15 = 4273.15 K.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, maybe the problem expects the pressure in terms of 1 cm³·atm = 101.325 J, which would be 101.325 J per cm³·atm. Wait, that can't be right because 1 L·atm is 101.325 J, so 1 cm³·atm is 0.1 L·atm, which is 10.1325 J.

Wait, no, that can't be right. Let me be precise.

1 m³ = 1,000,000 liters.

1 liter = 1000 cm³.

So, 1 m³ = 1,000,000 * 1000 cm³ = 1e9 cm³.

So, 1 cm³ = 1e-9 m³.

Pressure in Pa is N/m².

So, 1 cm³·atm = 1e-9 m³ * 101325 Pa = 1e-9 * 101,325 = 0.000101325 J.

Wait, that's 1.01325e-4 J. So, 1 cm³·atm = 1.01325e-4 J.

Wait, that's different from what I thought earlier. So, if ΔV is 1 cm³/mol and ΔP is 3e6 atm, then VΔP = 1 * 3e6 cm³·atm = 3e6 * 1.01325e-4 J = 303.975 J.

Wait, that's way lower than before. So, 303.975 J is about 0.304 kJ.

Then, TΔS = 4273 K * 2.1 J/(K·mol) = 8973.3 J.

So, ΔG = 303.975 J - 8973.3 J = -8669.3 J ≈ -8.67 kJ/mol.

But that's a negative value, and the options don't have that. Hmm, perhaps I messed up the unit conversion again.

Wait, wait, earlier I thought 1 cm³·atm = 0.101325 J, but now I'm getting 1.01325e-4 J. Which is correct?

Let me compute 1 cm³·atm in J.

Pressure: 1 atm = 101325 Pa.

Volume: 1 cm³ = 1e-6 m³.

Work done = PΔV = 101325 Pa * 1e-6 m³ = 0.101325 J.

Ah, so 1 cm³·atm = 0.101325 J. So, earlier calculation was correct. So, 3e6 cm³·atm = 3e6 * 0.101325 J = 303,975 J ≈ 304 kJ.

So, I must have made a mistake in the second approach where I thought 1 cm³·atm was 1.01325e-4 J. That was incorrect.

So, going back, ΔG = 304,000 J - 8,973 J ≈ 295,027 J ≈ 295 kJ/mol.

But the options don't have 295. The closest is I:291.7.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the pressure to be 3e6 times the standard pressure, which is 1 atm. So, ΔP is 3e6 atm, but the formula is ΔG = ΔV ΔP + T ΔS.

Wait, let's try that.

ΔV ΔP = 1 cm³ * 3e6 atm = 3e6 cm³·atm = 3e6 * 0.101325 J = 303,975 J.

TΔS = 4000°C = 4273 K. 4273 * 2.1 = 8973 J.

So, ΔG = 303,975 + 8,973 = 312,948 J ≈ 312.9 kJ/mol.

But that's even further from the options. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is ΔG = VΔP + TΔS. But that would give a much larger value, which doesn't match any options.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the problem is using the formula ΔG = VΔP + TΔS, but with the signs as given.

Wait, no, that would make it positive 304 + 8.97 ≈ 312.97 kJ/mol, which is not an option.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck here. The calculation consistently gives me around 295 kJ/mol, but the closest option is I:291.7. Perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation somewhere.

Wait, let me try recalculating 4273 * 2.1.

4273 * 2 = 8546.

4273 * 0.1 = 427.3.

Total: 8546 + 427.3 = 8973.3 J.

So, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the pressure in terms of 1 cm³·atm = 101.325 J, which would be incorrect, but let's try it.

If 1 cm³·atm = 101.325 J, then 3e6 cm³·atm = 3e6 * 101.325 J = 303,975,000 J = 303,975 kJ. That's way too high.

No, that can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps the pressure is given as 3e6 times the crust pressure, which is around 1 atm, so ΔP = 3e6 atm. But that's what I've already done.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is using the change in Gibbs free energy as ΔG = ΔV ΔP + ΔS ΔT, but I'm not sure.

If I do that:

ΔV =1 cm³/mol, ΔP=3e6 atm.

ΔS=2.1 J/(K·mol), ΔT=4000°C=4273 K.

So, VΔP =1 *3e6 cm³·atm =3e6 *0.101325 J=303,975 J.

SΔT=2.1 *4273=8973 J.

So, ΔG=303,975 +8,973=312,948 J≈312.9 kJ/mol.

But again, no option matches.

Alternatively, maybe the formula is ΔG = VΔP - TΔS.

So, 303,975 - 8,973=295,002 J≈295 kJ/mol.

Still not matching any option.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses pressure in different units. Let me try using bar instead of atm.

1 bar = 1e5 Pa.

So, 3e6 atm =3e6 *1.01325 bar≈3,039,750 bar.

VΔP =1e-6 m³ *3,039,750 bar *1e5 Pa/bar.

Wait, 1 bar =1e5 Pa.

So, 3,039,750 bar =3.03975e8 Pa.

VΔP=1e-6 m³ *3.03975e8 Pa=3.03975e2 J=303.975 J.

Then, TΔS=4273 *2.1=8973 J.

So, ΔG=303.975 -8973= -8669 J≈-8.67 kJ/mol.

But that's negative and not matching any options.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me look at the options again.

The options are:

A: 8.3 kJ/mol

B:15 kJ/mol

C:500 kJ/mol

D:8347.5 J/mol

E:300 kJ/mol

F:29.17 kJ/mol

G:3.5 kJ/mol

H:2.917 kJ/mol

I:291.7 kJ/mol

J:600 J/mol

Wait, option D is 8347.5 J/mol, which is about 8.3475 kJ/mol. That's exactly the TΔS value I calculated earlier (8347.5 J when using ΔT=3975 K). So, perhaps the problem is only considering the TΔS term and ignoring the VΔP term. But that doesn't make sense because the formula requires both terms.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different approach, like ΔG = TΔS - PΔV.

Wait, let's try that.

ΔG = TΔS - PΔV.

T=4273 K, ΔS=2.1 J/(K·mol) → TΔS=8973 J.

P=3e6 atm, ΔV=1 cm³/mol → PΔV=3e6 *0.101325 J=303,975 J.

So, ΔG=8973 -303,975= -295,002 J≈-295 kJ/mol.

But the options don't have this either.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula ΔG = TΔS - VΔP.

So, 8973 -303,975= -295,002 J, same as above.

No match.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using just TΔS, ignoring VΔP. But that would give 8973 J≈9 kJ/mol, which isn't an option except perhaps option F (29.17), which is higher.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using ΔG = VΔP - TΔS, but using only the change in pressure and temperature, not the absolute values. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is using the formula ΔG = ΔV ΔP + ΔS ΔT, without subtracting.

So, 303,975 J +8,973 J=312,948 J≈313 kJ/mol. Not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the pressure in terms of 1 cm³·atm = 101.325 J, which would make ΔVΔP=1 *3e6 *101.325 J=303,975,000 J=303,975 kJ, which is way too high.

No, that can't be right.

Wait, maybe I should consider that the pressure change is 3e6 atm -1 atm ≈3e6 atm, and the temperature change is 4000°C -25°C=3975°C=3975 K.

So, ΔG= VΔP - SΔT.

VΔP=1 cm³ *3e6 atm=3e6 cm³·atm=3e6 *0.101325=303,975 J.

SΔT=2.1 J/(K·mol)*3975 K=8347.5 J.

So, ΔG=303,975 -8,347.5=295,627.5 J≈295.6 kJ/mol.

Still, no option matches. The closest is I:291.7 kJ/mol.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses T=4000 K instead of 4273 K. Let me try that.

T=4000 K.

TΔS=4000 *2.1=8400 J.

So, ΔG=303,975 -8,400=295,575 J≈295.58 kJ/mol.

Still no match.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses T=4000°C as 4000 K, which is incorrect because 4000°C is 4273 K.

If I use T=4000 K, then TΔS=4000 *2.1=8400 J.

ΔG=303,975 -8,400=295,575 J≈295.58 kJ/mol.

Still not matching any option.

Wait, perhaps I should check the options again. Option I is 291.7 kJ/mol, which is 291,700 J. Let me see if 303,975 - 8,347.5=295,627.5 J. That's 295.6275 kJ, which is about 295.6 kJ/mol. The option I is 291.7, which is about 4 kJ less. Maybe I made a miscalculation in the multiplication.

Wait, let me recompute 4273 K *2.1 J/(K·mol).

4273 *2=8546.

4273 *0.1=427.3.

Total=8546 +427.3=8973.3 J.

Yes, correct.

So, 303,975 -8,973.3=295,001.7 J≈295.002 kJ/mol.

Hmm, perhaps the intended answer is option I:291.7 kJ/mol, but I'm getting 295. Maybe the problem expects rounding to the nearest 100, but that would be 300 kJ/mol, which is option E.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the pressure calculation. Let me check that again.

ΔP=3e6 atm.

1 atm=101325 Pa.

So, 3e6 atm=3e6 *101325=3.03975e11 Pa.

ΔV=1 cm³=1e-6 m³.

VΔP=1e-6 *3.03975e11=3.03975e5 J=303,975 J.

Yes, correct.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck. Given the options, the closest is I:291.7 kJ/mol, but my calculation consistently gives around 295 kJ/mol. Perhaps the intended answer is I, considering possible rounding differences or a miscalculation in the problem setup.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses pressure as 3e6 times 1 atm without subtracting the crust pressure, so ΔP=3e6 atm, and T=4000 K.

Wait, let's try that.

ΔP=3e6 atm.

T=4000 K.

So, VΔP=1 *3e6 *0.101325=303,975 J.

TΔS=4000 *2.1=8400 J.

ΔG=303,975 -8,400=295,575 J≈295.58 kJ/mol.

Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the pressure in terms of MPa. 1 MPa=1e6 Pa. So, 3e6 atm=3e6 *101325 Pa=3.03975e11 Pa=303,975 MPa.

But that doesn't help with the calculation.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem uses the formula ΔG = VΔP + TΔS, which would give a much higher value, but that's not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the pressure is given in terms of 1 cm³·atm = 101.325 J, which would be incorrect, but let's see.

If 1 cm³·atm=101.325 J, then 3e6 cm³·atm=3e6 *101.325=303,975,000 J=303,975 kJ.

That's way too high, so that can't be right.

I think I've exhausted all possibilities. The correct calculation gives approximately 295 kJ/mol, but the closest option is I:291.7 kJ/mol. Perhaps the intended answer is I, considering some rounding or a different approach in the problem setup.

To estimate the change in Gibbs free energy, ΔG, for the reaction when moving from the Earth's crust to its core, the formula used is:

\[
\Delta G = V \Delta P - S \Delta T
\]

### Given Data:
- **Pressure at the core**: \( P = 3 \times 10^6 \, \text{atm} \)
- **Temperature at the core**: \( T = 4000^\circ \text{C} = 4273 \, \text{K} \)
- **Change in volume**: \( \Delta V = 1 \, \text{cm}^3 \, \text{mol}^{-1} = 1 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}^3 \, \text{mol}^{-1} \)
- **Change in entropy**: \( \Delta S = 2.1 \, \text{J} \, \text{K}^{-1} \, \text{mol}^{-1} \)

### Step 1: Convert Pressure to Pascals
\[
1 \, \text{atm} = 101325 \, \text{Pa}, \quad \Delta P = 3 \times 10^6 \, \text{atm} = 3 \times 10^6 \times 101325 \, \text{Pa} = 3.03975 \times 10^{11} \, \text{Pa}.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate \( V \Delta P \)
\[
V \Delta P = (1 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}^3) \times (3.03975 \times 10^{11} \, \text{Pa}) = 3.03975 \times 10^5 \, \text{J} = 303,975 \, \text{J}.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate \( T \Delta S \)
\[
T \Delta S = (4273 \, \text{K}) \times (2.1 \, \text{J} \, \text{K}^{-1} \, \text{mol}^{-1}) = 8973.3 \, \text{J}.
\]

### Step 4: Calculate \( \Delta G \)
\[
\Delta G = V \Delta P - T \Delta S = 303,975 \, \text{J} - 8,973.3 \, \text{J} = 295,001.7 \, \text{J} \approx 295 \, \text{kJ}.
\]

### Step 5: Compare with Options
The calculated value of \( \Delta G \) is approximately \( 295 \, \text{kJ} \). However, the closest option provided is:

**I: 291.7 kJ/mol**

This discrepancy may arise from rounding differences or slight variations in the problem setup. Based on the given options, the best match is:

**I: 291.7 kJ/mol**

### Final Answer:
I
