Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The reaction given is ethanol (C₂H₅OH) reacting with oxygen gas to produce carbon dioxide and water vapor. The balanced equation is:

C₂H₅OH(l) + 3 O₂(g) → 2 CO₂(g) + 3 H₂O(g)

The problem states that the change in internal energy (Δr U°) at 298 K is -1373 kJ/mol. I need to find the change in enthalpy (Δr H°) for this reaction. The options are A through J, each with a different value.

Hmm, I remember that the relationship between enthalpy change (ΔH) and internal energy change (ΔU) involves the heat at constant pressure and volume, respectively. The formula I recall is:

ΔH = ΔU + Δ(n)RT

Where Δ(n) is the change in the number of moles of gas, R is the gas constant, and T is the temperature in Kelvin.

Wait, let me make sure. Yes, because ΔH = q_p (heat at constant pressure), and ΔU = q_v (heat at constant volume). The difference between them comes from the work done by expansion, which relates to the change in the number of moles of gas.

So, first, I need to calculate Δ(n), the change in the number of moles of gas in the reaction.

Looking at the reaction:
- Reactants: 3 moles of O₂ (gas) and 1 mole of ethanol (liquid). Ethanol is a liquid, so it doesn't contribute to the gas moles.
- Products: 2 moles of CO₂ (gas) and 3 moles of H₂O (gas).

So, the moles of gas on the reactant side are 3 (only O₂). On the product side, it's 2 + 3 = 5 moles of gas.

Therefore, Δ(n) = moles of gas in products - moles in reactants = 5 - 3 = 2 moles.

Wait, but wait, ethanol is a liquid, so it's not counted. So yes, the change is 5-3=2.

Now, the temperature is 298 K. The gas constant R is usually 8.314 J/mol·K, but since the ΔU and ΔH are in kJ, I should convert R to kJ. So R = 0.008314 kJ/mol·K.

Putting it all together:

ΔH = ΔU + Δ(n) * R * T

Given ΔU is -1373 kJ/mol:

ΔH = (-1373) + (2) * (0.008314) * (298)

Let me calculate the second part first.

First, 0.008314 * 298 ≈ 2.477572

Multiply by 2: 2 * 2.477572 ≈ 4.955144 kJ/mol.

So, ΔH ≈ -1373 + 4.955 ≈ -1368.045 kJ/mol.

Wait, that's approximately -1368 kJ/mol.

Looking at the options, option J is -1368 kJ/mol.

Wait, but let me check the calculation again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

R is 8.314 J/mol·K, which is 0.008314 kJ/mol·K. 0.008314 * 298 = let me calculate:

298 * 0.008314 = 

Well, 300 * 0.008314 ≈ 2.4942, but since it's 298, which is 2 less, 2.4942 - 2 * 0.008314 = 2.4942 - 0.016628 = 2.477572 kJ/mol·K? Wait, no, wait, R is 0.008314 kJ/(mol·K), so the units are correct.

So 0.008314 * 298 = 2.477572 kJ/(mol·K) * K → 2.477572 kJ/mol.

Multiply by Δn=2: 2 * 2.477572 ≈ 4.955 kJ/mol.

So ΔH = (-1373) + 4.955 ≈ -1368.045 kJ/mol.

Looking at the options, option J is -1368 kJ/mol.

So the answer should be J.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes the formula is written as ΔH = ΔU + Δ(n)RT, but I want to make sure about the sign conventions. Since the moles of gas are increasing (from 3 to 5), the system is doing work, so the enthalpy should be more negative than the internal energy. Wait, no, let me think.

Wait, when the number of moles increases, more gas is formed, which means the system's volume increases, so work is done by the system. The formula for ΔH is ΔU + PΔV. Since PΔV is the work done by the system in expansion, if Δn is positive, PΔV is positive, so ΔH = ΔU + positive value. Therefore, since ΔU is negative and we add a positive value, ΔH becomes less negative than ΔU. Wait, but in this case, ΔU is -1373, and we add about +4.955, which makes ΔH ≈ -1368, which is less negative, meaning it's a higher value (closer to zero) than ΔU. That makes sense because when you produce more gas, the enthalpy change is more exothermic than the internal energy change? Wait, no, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, if the reaction is exothermic (ΔH negative), and we have more gas moles, the internal energy change is even more negative because the system is doing work. Wait, no, I think I'm getting confused. Let me think of an example.

If a reaction produces gas, the system is expanding, so it does work on the surroundings. The work done is PΔV, which is positive because the system is expanding. The first law says ΔU = q + w, where w is work done on the system. But when the system does work (expansion), w is negative. So, if the reaction is exothermic, q is negative, and if the system does work (expansion, so w is negative), then ΔU = q + w, which would be more negative than q. Hmm, but in our case, we're given ΔU, and we compute ΔH as ΔU + Δ(n)RT.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the formula. Let me just stick with the calculation I did. The result is approximately -1368, which is option J. So I think that's the correct answer.

The reaction given is:

\[
\mathrm{C}_2\mathrm{H}_5\mathrm{OH}(\mathrm{l}) + 3\mathrm{O}_2(\mathrm{g}) \rightarrow 2\mathrm{CO}_2(\mathrm{g}) + 3\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}(\mathrm{g})
\]

We are provided with the change in internal energy, \(\Delta_{\mathrm{r}} U^\ominus = -1373 \, \mathrm{kJ \, mol^{-1}}\), and need to calculate the change in enthalpy, \(\Delta_{\mathrm{r}} H^\ominus\), at 298 K. The relationship between \(\Delta H\) and \(\Delta U\) is given by:

\[
\Delta H = \Delta U + \Delta(n)\, R\, T
\]

where \(\Delta(n)\) is the change in the number of moles of gas, \(R\) is the gas constant (\(8.314 \, \mathrm{J \, mol^{-1} \, K^{-1}}\) or \(0.008314 \, \mathrm{kJ \, mol^{-1} \, K^{-1}}\)), and \(T\) is the temperature in Kelvin.

### Step 1: Calculate \(\Delta(n)\)
- **Reactants**: 3 moles of \(\mathrm{O}_2\) (gas) and 1 mole of ethanol (liquid).
- **Products**: 2 moles of \(\mathrm{CO}_2\) (gas) and 3 moles of \(\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}\) (gas).

\[
\Delta(n) = \text{moles of gas in products} - \text{moles of gas in reactants} = 5 - 3 = 2 \, \mathrm{mol}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate \(\Delta H\)
Using the formula:

\[
\Delta H = \Delta U + \Delta(n)\, R\, T
\]

Substitute the values:
- \(\Delta U = -1373 \, \mathrm{kJ \, mol^{-1}}\)
- \(\Delta(n) = 2 \, \mathrm{mol}\)
- \(R = 0.008314 \, \mathrm{kJ \, mol^{-1} \, K^{-1}}\)
- \(T = 298 \, \mathrm{K}\)

\[
\Delta H = -1373 + (2)(0.008314)(298)
\]

First, calculate \(R \cdot T\):

\[
0.008314 \times 298 = 2.477572 \, \mathrm{kJ \, mol^{-1}}
\]

Then, multiply by \(\Delta(n)\):

\[
2 \times 2.477572 = 4.955144 \, \mathrm{kJ \, mol^{-1}}
\]

Finally, add to \(\Delta U\):

\[
\Delta H = -1373 + 4.955144 = -1368.045 \, \mathrm{kJ \, mol^{-1}}
\]

Rounding to the nearest whole number gives:

\[
\Delta H \approx -1368 \, \mathrm{kJ \, mol^{-1}}
\]

### Final Answer:
The closest option to \(-1368 \, \mathrm{kJ \, mol^{-1}}\) is **J**.
