Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this meiosis question. Let's see what the problem says. The animal has a diploid number of 8. That means during normal times, each cell has 8 chromosomes. So, diploid is 8, and each chromosome has two chromatids after replication. 

The question has three parts: (a), (b), and (c). I need to find the number of chromatids in each stage.

Starting with part (a): tetrad stage. I remember that a tetrad is formed during prophase I of meiosis. So, during this phase, each homologous pair of chromosomes (each consisting of two sister chromatids) form the tetrad. Since the diploid number is 8, each cell has 8 chromosomes. But wait, each chromosome has two chromatids at this stage because DNA replication has already happened in the S phase before meiosis.

So, each tetrad consists of four chromatids. Wait, no, wait. Each homologous pair has two chromosomes, each with two chromatids. So each tetrad has four chromatids. But wait, the question is asking for how many chromatids are present in the tetrad stage. No, wait, the tetrad is a structure made of four chromatids? Or is it four chromosomes?

Wait, no, I think a tetrad is made of two homologous chromosomes, each with two chromatids. So each tetrad has two pairs of homologs, each with two chromatids. So each tetrad has four chromatids. So for each tetrad, which is a pair of homologs (each having two chromatids), the total would be four. But wait, since each homolog has two chromatids, two homologs would have four. So yes, each tetrad has four chromatids.

But wait, the question is phrased as "how many chromatids are present in the tetrad stage." But in the tetrad stage, each homologous pair is in the tetrad. So for each of the 8 chromosomes, wait no. Wait, the diploid is 8, so each cell has 8 chromosomes. But during meiosis, each cell (after replication) has 8 chromosomes, each with two chromatids, so 16 chromatids in total. But in the tetrad stage, each pair of homologs (so each two chromosomes) forms a tetrad. So each tetrad has four chromatids (since each has two, and there are two chromosomes in the pair). But wait, the question is asking for the number of chromatids in the entire cell at the tetrad stage. Or is it per tetrad?

Wait, the question says "how many chromatids are present in the tetrad stage." So I think it's per cell. So during the tetrad stage (prophase I), each cell has 8 chromosomes, each with two chromatids, so 16 chromatids in total. But no, wait, no. Because in the tetrad stage, each pair of homologs (each consisting of two chromatids) is present. So each pair is a tetrad. So for 8 chromosomes (diploid 8), there are 4 pairs of homologs. Each pair has four chromatids (two per chromosome, times two chromosomes). So 4 pairs × 4 = 16 chromatids in total. So part (a) would be 16 chromatids.

Wait, but looking at the options, option E says (a) 16, (b)4, (c)4. But let's check the other parts to make sure.

Part (b): late telophase of the first meiotic division. In late telophase I, the cell is getting ready to divide. After the first meiotic division, the cell will split into two. So during telophase I, the cell has just finished separating the homologs. So each daughter cell will have half the number of chromosomes, but each chromosome still has two chromatids. So the diploid is 8, so each daughter cell will have 4 chromosomes, each with two chromatids. Wait, but during late telophase I, the cell hasn't split yet. So the cell is still diploid, but the chromosomes have separated. So each cell would have 4 chromosomes, each with two chromatids, so 8 chromatids in total. But wait, no. Wait, the cell is in the first meiotic division, so after anaphase I, when the homologs are separated, each cell will have 4 chromosomes, each with two chromatids. But in late telophase I, the cell is still going through the division, so maybe the total number of chromatids is 8. But wait, the diploid number is 8, so during meiosis I, each cell starts with 8 chromosomes (16 chromatids). After anaphase I, each daughter cell has 4 chromosomes (8 chromatids). So in late telophase I, the cell is in the process of dividing, so each cell would have 4 chromosomes, each with two chromatids, so 8 chromatids in total.

Wait, but the question is asking for the number of chromatids in the cell during late telophase I. So the cell hasn't split yet, but the homologs have separated. So each cell would have 4 chromosomes, each with two chromatids. So 8 chromatids in total. So part (b) is 8.

Wait, but let me think again. During prophase I, the cell has 8 chromosomes (16 chromatids). During anaphase I, these homologs are pulled apart, so each cell will have 4 chromosomes, each with two chromatids, so 8 chromatids. So yes, part (b) is 8.

Part (c): metaphase of the second meiotic division. In the second meiotic division, each cell is haploid (assuming no crossing over and normal division). So each cell has 4 chromosomes, each with two chromatids. But during metaphase II, the chromosomes align at the equator. Each chromosome has two chromatids. So each cell has 4 chromosomes × 2 = 8 chromatids in total.

Wait, but in metaphase II, the cell is about to split. So each cell has 4 chromosomes, each with two chromatids. So 8 chromatids.

Wait, but looking at the options, let's see.

Looking back at the options, let's see:

Option E: (a)16, (b)4, (c)4.

No, because part (b) is 8, not 4.

Option G: (a)16, (b)8, (c)8.

Hmm, part (a) 16, part (b) 8, part (c)8. So that would match our analysis.

Wait, but let me double-check. Part (a) is the tetrad stage, which is during prophase I, where each homologous pair has four chromatids. So for 8 chromosomes, each with two chromatids, the total is 16. So part (a) is 16.

Part (b) is late telophase I, where the cell has 4 chromosomes, each with two chromatids, so 8 total.

Part (c) is metaphase II, where each cell has 4 chromosomes, each with two chromatids, so 8 total.

So looking at the options, which one matches (a)16, (b)8, (c)8.

Looking at the options:

Option G: (a)16, (b)8, (c)8.

Yes, that's the one.

Wait, but let me check other options. Option E has (a)16, (b)4, (c)4. No, because (b) is 8.

Option H: (a)16, (b)8, (c)16. No, because part (c) is 8.

Option D: (a)8, (b)16, (c)4. No.

Option F: (a)4, (b)16, (c)8. No.

So the correct option is G.

The animal has a diploid number of 8, meaning each cell has 8 chromosomes, and each chromosome has two chromatids after DNA replication. 

(a) In the tetrad stage (prophase I), each homologous pair of chromosomes forms a tetrad. Since each chromosome has two chromatids, each tetrad contains four chromatids. With 8 chromosomes, there are 16 chromatids in total during this stage.

(b) In late telophase I, the homologs have been separated, and the cell is preparing to divide. Each daughter cell will have 4 chromosomes, each with two chromatids, resulting in 8 chromatids in total.

(c) In metaphase II, each cell is haploid, with 4 chromosomes, each still having two chromatids. Thus, there are 8 chromatids in total during this stage.

The correct option is **G**: (a) 16 chromatids, (b) 8 chromatids, (c) 8 chromatids.
