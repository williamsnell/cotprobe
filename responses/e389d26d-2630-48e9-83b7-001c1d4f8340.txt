Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. It's a multiple-part question about probability density functions, quantization levels, and variance. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to work through each part carefully.

First, the problem states that the probability density function (pdf) of a signal is given by f(x) = K e^(-|x|) for |x| < 4, and zero otherwise. There are three parts to the question: finding the step size S, determining the constant K, and calculating the variance of the quantization error. Each part has options A through J, so I'll need to figure out each part one by one.

Starting with part (a): What is the step size S if there are four quantization levels?

Hmm, quantization levels typically divide the range of the signal into intervals. Since the pdf is defined for |x| < 4, the total range is from -4 to +4, which is 8 units. If there are four quantization levels, I think that means the range is divided into three intervals, each corresponding to a step. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. Quantization levels usually refer to the number of intervals plus one. Wait, no, perhaps it's better to think of it as the number of regions between the quantization points. So, four quantization levels would mean three intervals? Or maybe four intervals? No, wait, perhaps the number of levels is the number of regions. Let me clarify: For example, if you have two quantization levels, you have one step. So, for four levels, how many steps? Or perhaps the number of steps is one less than the number of levels. Wait, no, I think the number of quantization levels is the number of possible output values, which would correspond to n+1 where n is the number of intervals. So if there are four levels, maybe the number of intervals is three. But wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, another approach: The quantization step size S is the width of each interval between quantization points. So if the total range is 8 (from -4 to +4), and there are four quantization levels, how many intervals are there? Let me think, the number of intervals is one less than the number of levels. So four levels would mean three intervals. Therefore, each interval would be 8/(4-1) = 8/3 ≈ 2.666. But that doesn't match any of the options. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Alternatively, perhaps four levels imply four intervals, so each step would be 8/4 = 2. That seems more plausible. Let me check the options. Looking at the options, several have step size 2, such as B, C, D, F, I, J. So maybe the step size S is 2. Let me proceed with that for now.

Next, part (b): Find the value of the constant K.

The pdf is given by f(x) = K e^(-|x|) for |x| < 4, and zero otherwise. To find K, we know that the integral of f(x) over all x must equal 1. So, the integral from -4 to 4 of K e^(-|x|) dx equals 1.

Since the function is symmetric (because of |x|), I can compute twice the integral from 0 to 4 of K e^(-x) dx.

So, 2 * K ∫ (from 0 to 4) e^(-x) dx = 1.

The integral of e^(-x) dx from 0 to 4 is [-e^(-x)] from 0 to 4, which is (-e^(-4)) - (-1) = 1 - e^(-4).

So, 2K (1 - e^(-4)) = 1.

Solving for K: K = 1/(2(1 - e^(-4))).

Let me compute this numerically. e^(-4) is approximately 0.0183156. So 1 - e^(-4) ≈ 0.9816844. Then 2*(0.9816844) ≈ 1.9633688. So K ≈ 1/1.9633688 ≈ 0.5093.

Looking at the options, several have K=0.5093, such as A, C, E, F, G, H, I. So that's good.

Now part (c): Determine the variance of the quantization error when there are four quantization levels, and f(x) is not constant over each level.

Hmm, quantization error variance. I remember that for quantization, the error is the difference between the original signal x and its quantized version x_q. The quantization levels are determined by the step size S.

Since the step size S is 2, as determined in part (a), the quantization levels would be at x = -4, -2, 0, +2, +4? Wait, wait, no. Wait, with four levels, the midpoints would be at -3, -1, +1, +3, assuming S=2. Because each level would cover a range of 2 units. For example, the first level might be -4 to -2, mid at -3; second level -2 to 0, mid at -1; third 0 to +2, mid at +1; fourth +2 to +4, mid at +3. Or perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, the quantization points could be at the midpoints of each interval. So the intervals are (-4, -2), (-2, 0), (0, +2), (+2, +4). Each interval has width S=2.

The quantization error e is given by e = x - x_q, where x_q is the quantized value (the midpoint of the interval in which x lies).

To find the variance of e, Var(e) = E[e^2] - (E[e])^2. But since the quantization is symmetric, E[e] should be zero, so Var(e) = E[e^2].

The formula for quantization error variance when the source pdf is not constant over each level is given by the sum over each interval of the integral of (e)^2 f(x) dx, where e is the error within that interval.

So, for each interval, the error e is the difference between x and the quantization point x_q. For example, in the first interval (-4, -2), x_q would be -3, so e = x - (-3) = x + 3. Similarly, for the next interval (-2, 0), x_q is -1, so e = x +1. For (0, 2), x_q is +1, so e = x -1. For (2,4), x_q is +3, so e = x -3.

The variance would then be the sum over each interval of the integral from x_start to x_end of (x - x_q)^2 f(x) dx.

Given that f(x) = K e^{-|x|}, and K is 0.5093 as found earlier.

Let me compute each integral.

First interval: (-4, -2), x_q = -3. So e = x +3. The integral from -4 to -2 of (x +3)^2 * K e^{-|x|} dx.

Since x is negative here, |x| = -x. So f(x) = K e^{x} (because e^{-|x|} = e^{x} when x is negative).

So the integral becomes:

∫ from -4 to -2 of (x +3)^2 * K e^{x} dx.

Let me make a substitution u = x + 3. Then when x=-4, u=-1; x=-2, u=1. So the integral becomes ∫ from u=-1 to u=1 of u^2 * K e^{(u-3)} du.

Wait, because x = u -3, so e^{x} = e^{u-3}.

Hmm, that might complicate things, but perhaps integrating u^2 e^{u-3} is manageable.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute numerically, but maybe I can find a pattern or symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps using integration by parts.

But maybe it's easier to compute each integral separately and then sum them up.

Alternatively, since the function is symmetric, perhaps some integrals can be simplified.

Wait, this might take a while, but let's proceed.

Let me compute the integral for the first interval:

I1 = ∫ from -4 to -2 of (x +3)^2 * K e^{x} dx.

Let me expand (x+3)^2 = x^2 +6x +9.

So I1 = K ∫ (x^2 e^x +6x e^x +9 e^x) dx from -4 to -2.

Integrating term by term:

∫ x^2 e^x dx = (x^2 - 2x +2) e^x + C

∫ x e^x dx = (x -1) e^x + C

∫ e^x dx = e^x + C

So,

I1 = K [ (x^2 -2x +2) e^x + 6(x -1) e^x +9 e^x ] evaluated from x=-4 to x=-2.

Simplify the expression inside:

= K [ (x^2 -2x +2 +6x -6 +9) e^x ]

= K [ (x^2 +4x +5) e^x ] from -4 to -2.

Compute at x=-2:

= (-2)^2 +4*(-2) +5 = 4 -8 +5 = 1.

So term at -2: 1 * e^{-2}.

At x=-4:

= (-4)^2 +4*(-4) +5 = 16 -16 +5 =5.

So term at -4:5 * e^{-4}.

So I1 = K [ (1*e^{-2}) - (5 e^{-4}) ].

Similarly, compute for the second interval: (-2, 0), x_q=-1.

e = x +1.

Integral I2 = ∫ from -2 to 0 of (x+1)^2 * K e^{-|x|} dx.

Since x is negative in (-2,0), |x| = -x, so f(x)=K e^{x}.

Wait, no, wait: For x in (-2, 0), x is negative only when x is between -2 and 0. So for x in (-2,0), |x| = -x, so f(x)=K e^{x}.

Wait, but wait, no: Wait, when x is negative, |x| is -x, so f(x)= K e^{-|x|} = K e^{x}.

So I2 = K ∫ from -2 to 0 of (x+1)^2 e^{x} dx.

Again, expand (x+1)^2 = x^2 +2x +1.

So I2 = K ∫ (x^2 e^x + 2x e^x + e^x) dx from -2 to 0.

Integrate term by term:

∫ x^2 e^x dx = (x^2 - 2x +2) e^x

∫ 2x e^x dx = 2*(x -1) e^x

∫ e^x dx = e^x

So I2 = K [ (x^2 -2x +2) e^x + 2(x -1) e^x + e^x ] evaluated from -2 to 0.

Simplify the expression:

= K [ (x^2 -2x +2 +2x -2 +1) e^x ]

= K [ (x^2 +1) e^x ] from -2 to 0.

At x=0: (0 +1) e^0 =1*1=1.

At x=-2: (4 +1) e^{-2} =5 e^{-2}.

So I2 = K [ (1) - (5 e^{-2}) ].

Third interval: (0,2), x_q=1.

e = x -1.

Integral I3 = ∫ from 0 to 2 of (x-1)^2 * K e^{-x} dx.

Because for x>0, |x|=x, so f(x)=K e^{-x}.

Expanding (x-1)^2 =x^2 -2x +1.

I3 = K ∫ (x^2 e^{-x} -2x e^{-x} +e^{-x}) dx from 0 to 2.

Integrate term by term:

∫ x^2 e^{-x} dx = (-x^2 -2x -2) e^{-x} 

∫ -2x e^{-x} dx = (-2x +2) e^{-x}

∫ e^{-x} dx = -e^{-x}

So I3 = K [ (-x^2 -2x -2) e^{-x} + (-2x +2) e^{-x} - e^{-x} ] from 0 to 2.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the integration. Let me double-check.

Actually, it's better to compute each integral separately.

Wait, perhaps using the standard integrals:

∫ x^2 e^{-x} dx = (-x^2 - 2x -2) e^{-x} + C

∫ x e^{-x} dx = (-x -1) e^{-x} + C

∫ e^{-x} dx = -e^{-x} + C

So, I3 = K [ ∫ x^2 e^{-x} dx - 2 ∫ x e^{-x} dx + ∫ e^{-x} dx ]

= K [ ( (-x^2 -2x -2) e^{-x} ) - 2*( (-x -1) e^{-x} ) + (-e^{-x}) ) ] evaluated from 0 to 2.

Simplify the expression inside:

= K [ (-x^2 -2x -2) e^{-x} + 2x e^{-x} + 2 e^{-x} - e^{-x} ]

= K [ (-x^2 -2x -2 + 2x +2 -1) e^{-x} ]

= K [ (-x^2 -1) e^{-x} ]

Evaluated from 0 to 2.

At x=2:

= (-4 -1) e^{-2} = (-5) e^{-2}.

At x=0:

= (-0 -1) e^{0} = (-1)(1) = -1.

So I3 = K [ (-5 e^{-2}) - (-1) ] = K [1 -5 e^{-2} ].

Wait, because when evaluating from 0 to 2, it's [upper - lower], so:

= K [ (-5 e^{-2}) - (-1) ] = K [1 -5 e^{-2} ].

Wait, that seems correct.

Fourth interval: (2,4), x_q=3.

e = x -3.

Integral I4 = ∫ from 2 to 4 of (x-3)^2 * K e^{-x} dx.

Expanding (x-3)^2 =x^2 -6x +9.

I4 = K ∫ (x^2 e^{-x} -6x e^{-x} +9 e^{-x}) dx from 2 to 4.

Integrate term by term:

∫ x^2 e^{-x} dx = (-x^2 -2x -2) e^{-x}

∫ -6x e^{-x} dx = -6*(-x -1) e^{-x} = 6(x +1) e^{-x}

∫ 9 e^{-x} dx = -9 e^{-x}

So I4 = K [ (-x^2 -2x -2) e^{-x} +6(x +1) e^{-x} -9 e^{-x} ] evaluated from 2 to 4.

Simplify the expression inside:

= K [ (-x^2 -2x -2 +6x +6 -9) e^{-x} ]

= K [ (-x^2 +4x -5) e^{-x} ]

Evaluated from 2 to 4.

At x=4:

= (-16 +16 -5) e^{-4} = (-5) e^{-4}.

At x=2:

= (-4 +8 -5) e^{-2} = (-1) e^{-2}.

So I4 = K [ (-5 e^{-4}) - (-1 e^{-2}) ] = K [ (-5 e^{-4} + e^{-2}) ].

Now, summing up all four integrals:

Var(e) = I1 + I2 + I3 + I4.

Let me compute each term numerically, using K=0.5093.

Compute each integral:

I1 = K [e^{-2} -5 e^{-4} ].

e^{-2} ≈ 0.135335, e^{-4} ≈ 0.0183156.

So I1 ≈ 0.5093*(0.135335 -5*0.0183156) = 0.5093*(0.135335 -0.091578) = 0.5093*(0.043757) ≈ 0.5093 *0.043757 ≈ 0.02237.

I2 = K [1 -5 e^{-2} ].

= 0.5093*(1 -5*0.135335) = 0.5093*(1 -0.676675) = 0.5093*(0.323325) ≈ 0.5093*0.323325 ≈ 0.1646.

I3 = K [1 -5 e^{-2} ].

Same as I2: ≈0.1646.

I4 = K [ (-5 e^{-4} ) + e^{-2} ].

= 0.5093*(-5*0.0183156 +0.135335) = 0.5093*(-0.091578 +0.135335) = 0.5093*(0.043757) ≈0.02237.

Adding all together: 0.02237 +0.1646 +0.1646 +0.02237 ≈ 0.3739.

Looking at the options, option F has K=0.5093 and variance 0.3739. Also, option A has variance 0.3739 but with step size 3, which is incorrect. Option F: step size 2, K=0.5093, Variance:0.3739. So that matches.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations for any possible mistakes. Especially in the integration steps. Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula for variance without computing all these integrals, but I think the approach is correct.

Another thought: The variance of the quantization error can also be approximated using the formula Var(e) = (S^2/12) * (probability that the error is within each interval). But I'm not sure if that's applicable here since the source pdf isn't uniform. So perhaps the method I used is more accurate.

So, putting it all together:

(a) Step size S=2.

(b) K=0.5093.

(c) Variance≈0.3739.

Which matches option F: Step size:2; K:0.5093; Variance:0.3739.
</think>

The problem involves determining the step size, constant, and variance of quantization error for a given probability density function. 

(a) The step size \( S \) is calculated by dividing the total range \(-4\) to \(4\) into four quantization levels, resulting in \( S = 2 \).

(b) The constant \( K \) is found by ensuring the integral of the PDF equals 1. Solving gives \( K \approx 0.5093 \).

(c) The variance of the quantization error is computed by integrating the squared error over each interval. The result matches \( 0.3739 \).

The correct option is **F**.

Answer: F
