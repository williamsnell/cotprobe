Okay, so I've got this question about a grammar and its properties. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The grammar given is:
S → ( S )
S → x

And the options are statements about whether the grammar is ambiguous, suitable for top-down parsing, and/or suitable for bottom-up parsing. The options are labeled I, II, III, and then the possible answers are combinations of these.

First, I need to understand each part.

Statement I: The grammar is ambiguous. Ambiguity in a grammar usually means that there's more than one parse tree for a string, or more than one way to derive the same string. So, I should check if this grammar allows for multiple derivations of the same string.

Looking at the productions, S can produce either (S) or x. Let's see for a string like x. The only way to derive x is S → x. So that's one parse tree. So for x, it's unambiguous.

What about a longer string, say (x)? Let's see: S → (S) and then S → x. So the derivation is S → (S) → (x). That's one way. No other options because the only other production for S is x, which doesn't start with (. So for (x), only one parse tree. Hmm.

Wait, what about a string like ((x))? Let's see: S → (S) → ((S)) → ((x)). So that's one way. Alternatively, could there be another way? Let me see: Maybe S → (S), and then the inner S could be either x or (S). So for ((x)), the parse tree is straightforward. But wait, can the same string be derived in more than one way? Let me think again. No, because each step only has one option when building up. So maybe this grammar isn't ambiguous? Because each production is only S expanding to (S) or x, and each time you have a choice, but once you choose, the rest follows. So perhaps the grammar isn't ambiguous. So statement I might be false.

Wait, but sometimes ambiguity arises when a string can be parsed in two different ways. Let me take another example. Suppose the string is ( (x) ). Wait, that's the same as ((x)), which we've seen only has one parse tree. Alternatively, could there be a case where a string can be derived in two different ways?

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let's consider the string "x". It can only be derived one way. The string "(x)" can only be derived one way. The string "((x))" also only one way. So maybe this grammar isn't ambiguous. So statement I would be false, so any option that includes I being true would be incorrect.

Then, statement II: The grammar is suitable for top-down parsing. Top-down parsing typically refers to methods like recursive descent, which work by trying to match the leftmost production first. Since this grammar has only two productions for S, and each is a choice between (S) and x, a top-down parser should handle it. Because each production is straightforward, and you can try each option. So I think statement II is true.

Statement III: The grammar is suitable for bottom-up parsing. Bottom-up parsing, like shift-reduce, uses a stack and tries to match the right-hand sides of the productions. For this grammar, let's see if it's suitable. Let's look for possible left recursions or issues.

Wait, the grammar has S → (S). That's a left-recursive rule because S appears on the left side of the production. Left recursion can cause problems in bottom-up parsers because they typically process from right to left. Wait, but sometimes you can convert left-recursive grammars into right-recursive ones for bottom-up parsing, but it depends on the specific grammar.

Alternatively, maybe the grammar is suitable. Let me think about the possible parse trees. For a string like (x), the bottom-up approach would start by seeing x, then see the parentheses. So perhaps a shift-reduce parser can handle it. But let me check for possible ambiguity again. Wait, earlier I thought the grammar isn't ambiguous, so that's fine.

Wait, but the problem is left recursion. Left recursion in a grammar can make it difficult for bottom-up parsers, which usually prefer right recursion. So perhaps this grammar isn't suitable for bottom-up parsing because of the left recursion in S → (S). Because in bottom-up parsing, you process from the end, and left recursion can cause issues like infinite loops or not being able to reduce properly.

Wait, for example, when parsing (S), the bottom-up parser would see the closing parenthesis, then try to reduce it with the production S → (S). But without seeing the entire (S), it might not know when to stop. Alternatively, perhaps the grammar can be rewritten to remove left recursion, making it suitable for bottom-up parsing.

Wait, how about converting S → (S) into a right-recursive form. Since S → (S) is left-recursive, we can rewrite it to avoid left recursion. Let me try: S → ( S' ), where S' → S | ε. But that's complicating it. Alternatively, perhaps the original grammar is ambiguous, but earlier I thought it wasn't.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. So, let's try to see if the grammar is left-recursive. Yes, S → (S) is left-recursive. So that could cause problems for bottom-up parsers, which are typically not good with left recursion. Therefore, statement III might be false. So the grammar isn't suitable for bottom-up parsing.

Wait, but maybe the grammar can be handled with a bottom-up parser even with left recursion. I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the grammar is suitable because the productions are simple. Let me think of the possible parse steps.

Take the string "(x)". The bottom-up parser would read x, then see the closing ), and then try to match S → (S). So it would shift x, then when it sees ), it would pop x and see if it matches the right-hand side of any production. The production S → x is applicable, so it would create a node S with x, then see the ). Then, it would look for a production that can match ( followed by S. So S → (S) would apply, creating a new S node containing the previous S. So it seems possible. So maybe the grammar is suitable for bottom-up parsing despite the left recursion.

Wait, but another example: suppose the string is "((x))". Then, the parser would process x, then ), then ), then (. Hmm, but that might not work. Because the first ) would trigger the production S → x, but then the ( would be left, which is a problem. So perhaps the left recursion makes it difficult for bottom-up parsing.

Alternatively, perhaps the left recursion can be handled if the grammar is converted into a right-recursive form. But the question is about the given grammar, not a transformed one. So in the given form, perhaps the bottom-up parser would have trouble, making statement III false.

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident. So let me try to summarize:

Statement I: Grammar is ambiguous. Earlier, I thought it's not, because each string has only one parse tree. So I is false.

Statement II: Suitable for top-down parsing. Yes, because top-down can handle it. So II is true.

Statement III: Suitable for bottom-up parsing. Since there's left recursion, perhaps it's not suitable. So III is false.

Wait, but earlier when I thought about the string (x), it seemed possible. So maybe it's possible. Alternatively, perhaps the left recursion is not a problem because the production S → (S) can be processed correctly. Like, the stack would have the ( and then when the S is processed, it can reduce.

Alternatively, perhaps the grammar is suitable for bottom-up parsing. So if statement III is true, then what?

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the options again.

The options are:

A: III only and not II
B: II only and not III
C: I only
D: I and II only
E: III only
F: Neither I, II, nor III
G: II and III only
H: II only
I: I and III only
J: I, II, and III

Wait, I thought I is false, so any option that includes I (like D, I, J) is out.

So possible options are B, G, H, E, A, F.

Now, earlier I thought II is true and III is false. So statement II is true, III is false. So the only true statement is II.

Looking at the options, option B is "II only and not III." That would fit.

Wait, but earlier I thought that III might be true. Let me think again.

If the grammar is suitable for bottom-up parsing, then statement III is true. So if both II and III are true, then option G would be correct. But earlier I thought that left recursion might make it unsuitable for bottom-up.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about III. Let me think again about bottom-up parsing. Shift-reduce parsers can handle grammars with left recursion if they are transformed into right-recursive form, but the given grammar isn't in that form. So perhaps the given grammar isn't suitable for bottom-up parsing as is.

Wait, but in this case, the grammar is very simple. Maybe it's possible. Let me try to construct a parse stack.

Take the string "(x)". The bottom-up parser would process the string from right to left.

Start with stack: [ ], input: ( x )

Take x, push it to stack. Stack: [x]

Next token is ). Now, looking for a production that starts with ). The production S → (S) has a left-hand side S, and the right-hand side starts with (. So when we see ), perhaps we look for a way to reduce.

Wait, but in shift-reduce parsing, when you see a ), you would look for a production that ends with ), but our production starts with (.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think differently. In bottom-up parsing, you shift tokens until you can apply a reduction.

For "(x)", the input is ( x )

- Shift x. Stack: x
- Next token is ). Now, check if the top of stack matches any right-hand side of a production. The production S → x is applicable, so we can reduce x to S. So stack becomes S.

Now, the next token is (.

Wait, but if the parser is processing from right to left, the next token after x would be ), but perhaps I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, maybe the stack after processing x and ) would be S, and then the next token is (.

Wait, no, perhaps I should model it as processing from right to left.

Wait, in the string "(x)", the tokens are ( and x, but perhaps the processing is done from the end. So the first token is x, then ), then (.

But I'm getting stuck. Maybe it's better to look for an example. Let me see.

In any case, perhaps the grammar is suitable for bottom-up parsing because it's simple, and the left recursion doesn't cause issues in this specific case. Or maybe it's not suitable because of the left recursion.

Alternatively, perhaps the grammar is ambiguous, but I thought it wasn't.

Wait, let me get back to whether the grammar is ambiguous. Let's take the string "x(x)". Wait, no, because S can only produce x or (S). So the string would be like x, or (x), or ((x)), etc. So each string can only be derived in one way, so the grammar is unambiguous. So statement I is false.

So, going back, statement I is false, statement II is true, and statement III is... I'm not sure. If the grammar can be handled with bottom-up parsing, then statement III is true, making option G (II and III only) correct. But if statement III is false, then option B is correct.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused about whether the grammar is suitable for bottom-up. Let me think about shift-reduce parsing. For the production S → (S), the right-hand side starts with (, which is a non-terminal. So when we see (, we would push it onto the stack. Then, when we see S, we would process it. But for bottom-up, perhaps the left recursion can cause issues because the parser would need to see the entire (S) before it can reduce.

Alternatively, perhaps the left recursion doesn't prevent bottom-up parsing. For example, the grammar S → a S | ε is left-recursive but can be handled with a bottom-up parser by reordering the productions, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the given grammar is suitable for bottom-up parsing. So statement III is true.

If that's the case, then statements II and III are true, making option G the correct answer.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the left recursion would cause problems. I'm a bit torn here.

Wait, another approach: let's look for whether the grammar is LL(1) or not. Because if it's LL(1), it's suitable for top-down parsing. But for bottom-up, perhaps it's SLR or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the grammar is ambiguous, but I don't think so.

Wait, perhaps the grammar is ambiguous. Let me think again. Suppose the string is ( (x) ). How many parse trees are there? Only one: S → (S) → ((S)) → ((x)). So it's not ambiguous.

Wait, so I is false. So options with I are out.

So, II is true, III is... Let me think again. If the grammar can be parsed with a bottom-up approach, then III is true. But given the left recursion, perhaps it can't.

Wait, perhaps the answer is that only II is true, making option B correct. Because the grammar is suitable for top-down parsing but not for bottom-up due to the left recursion.

Alternatively, perhaps bottom-up can handle it. I'm a bit stuck, but I think the correct answer is that the grammar is suitable for top-down parsing but not for bottom-up, making option B correct.

Wait, but earlier I thought that statement III is false because of left recursion. So, II is true, III is false. So the answer is option B: II only and not III.

But I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, perhaps both II and III are true, making option G correct.

Wait, perhaps I should look for examples. Let me see.

In the grammar, S can produce (S) or x. For top-down, it's easy because you can choose between the two options at each step.

For bottom-up, let's take the string "x". The steps would be: start with x. Apply S → x. That's straightforward.

For the string "(x)", the steps would be: read x, then ). Apply S → x, then apply S → (S), so the stack would reduce when the ) is encountered.

Wait, perhaps it's manageable. So maybe statement III is true.

Wait, but in the case of "(x)", the bottom-up parser would process the ) after x. So the stack would have x, then when ) is read, it can reduce x to S (using S → x), then when the ( is processed, it can reduce (S) to S (using S → (S)). So that works.

Similarly, for "((x))", the steps would be:

- x → S
- ) → S → (S)
- ( → push (
- Then, the next ) would trigger another reduction.

Wait, maybe it can be handled. So perhaps the grammar is suitable for bottom-up parsing, making statement III true.

If that's the case, then both II and III are true, making option G correct.

But I'm not entirely confident about this. Alternatively, perhaps the presence of left recursion makes it impossible, so only II is true.

Wait, another way to think: left recursion is a problem for bottom-up parsers because they typically process from right to left, and left recursion can lead to infinite loops or inability to reduce.

But in this grammar, the left recursion is only in S → (S). So, for example, when a ( is encountered, the parser would push it onto the stack, then expect an S. Once the S is processed, it can reduce.

Wait, perhaps it's manageable, so the grammar is suitable for bottom-up parsing.

In that case, both II and III are true, making option G correct.

But earlier I thought that left recursion would cause issues, but perhaps the grammar is simple enough that it can be handled.

Alternatively, perhaps the grammar isn't suitable for bottom-up parsing because of the left recursion, making statement III false.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck, but perhaps the answer is option B: II only and not III.

The grammar provided is:

```
S → ( S )
S → x
```

### Analysis of Statements:

1. **Statement I: The grammar is ambiguous.**  
   Ambiguity occurs if a string can be derived in multiple ways. For example:
   - The string `x` can only be derived as `S → x`.
   - The string `(x)` can only be derived as `S → (S) → (x)`.
   - The string `((x))` can only be derived as `S → (S) → ((S)) → ((x))`.
   Since every string derived from this grammar has a unique parse tree, the grammar is **unambiguous**.  
   **Conclusion:** Statement I is false.

2. **Statement II: The grammar is suitable for top-down parsing.**  
   Top-down parsing (e.g., recursive descent) works by trying to match the leftmost production first. The grammar has two productions for `S`: `(S)` and `x`. A top-down parser can handle this by choosing between the two options at each step. There are no conflicts or ambiguities that would prevent top-down parsing.  
   **Conclusion:** Statement II is true.

3. **Statement III: The grammar is suitable for bottom-up parsing.**  
   Bottom-up parsing (e.g., shift-reduce) processes inputs from right to left and uses a stack to reduce strings to the start symbol. The grammar contains a left-recursive production `S → (S)`, which can cause issues for bottom-up parsers because they typically process from right to left. Left recursion can lead to infinite loops or inability to reduce properly. While the grammar is simple, the left recursion makes it unsuitable for bottom-up parsing without modification.  
   **Conclusion:** Statement III is false.

### Final Answer:
Based on the analysis, only **Statement II** is true. Therefore, the correct option is:

**Answer: B**
