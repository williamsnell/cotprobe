Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about regression, and I'm supposed to figure out which statement is false. Let me think through each option carefully.

First, I remember that regression analysis is a statistical method used in various fields. It's primarily used to understand the relationship between variables. Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A says, "It may be used for interpretation." I think that's true because regression models can show how each input variable affects the output. Like, if you have a regression equation, you can see the coefficients which tell you the impact of each variable. So A is probably true.

Option B: "It is used for prediction." That definitely sounds right. I've heard regression used a lot for forecasting, like predicting sales based on advertising spend or something like that. So B is true.

Option C: "It relates inputs to outputs." Yes, regression is all about finding the relationship between independent variables (inputs) and a dependent variable (output). So C is correct.

Option D: "It discovers causal relationships." Hmm, this one is a bit tricky. I remember that correlation doesn't imply causation. Regression can show that two variables are related, but it doesn't necessarily mean one causes the other. For example, just because ice cream sales and drowning incidents both go up in the summer doesn't mean ice cream causes drowning. There's a confounding variable, like the weather. So D is actually false because regression can't discover causation on its own; it only shows associations.

So putting it all together, the false statement is D.

The false statement regarding regression is D: It discovers causal relationships. Regression can show associations but not causation.

Answer: D
