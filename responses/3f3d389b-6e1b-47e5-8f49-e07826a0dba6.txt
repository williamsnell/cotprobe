Okay, so I need to solve this problem where Dani has 45 marbles, and she has 5 times as many as Joe. I'm supposed to find out how many marbles Joe has. Let me break this down step by step.

First, let's understand the problem. Dani's marbles are 5 times Joe's. So, if I let Joe's marbles be a certain number, say J, then Dani has 5 times that number. The problem states that Dani has 45 marbles, so I can set up an equation based on that.

So, the equation would be: Dani's marbles = 5 × Joe's marbles. In numbers, that's 45 = 5 × J. To find J, I need to solve for it. That means I'll divide both sides of the equation by 5.

Let me write that out: 45 ÷ 5 = J. Doing the division, 45 divided by 5 is 9. So, J equals 9. That means Joe has 9 marbles.

Looking at the options, J is option J. So, the correct answer should be J: 9.

Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Sometimes when setting up equations, it's easy to mix up who has more. The problem says Dani has 5 times as many as Joe. So if Joe has J marbles, Dani has 5J. And 5J equals 45, so J is 9. Yep, that checks out.

I think that's correct. So the answer is J.

The problem states that Dani has 45 marbles, which is 5 times as many as Joe. To find Joe's marbles, set up the equation 45 = 5 × J. Solving for J gives J = 9.
