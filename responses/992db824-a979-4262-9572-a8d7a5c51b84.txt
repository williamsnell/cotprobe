Question:

What is meant by the marginal product of aproductive factor?

Options:

A: The total output produced by a single unit of a factor
B: The increase in total cost when one more unit of a factor is employed, holding all other factors constant
C: The cost of producing an additional unit of output
D: The amount by which total output increases due to the addition of one unit of a given factor while the amount used of other factors of production remains unchanged
E: The revenue generated from selling the output produced by an additional unit of a factor
F: The ratio of total output to the number of units of a factor used
G: The added value of a unit of output
H: The average output produced by all units of a factor
I: The decrease in total output when one unit of a factor is removed
J: The profit earned from the production of one more unit of output using an additional unit of a factor

Okay, so I need to figure out what the marginal product of a productive factor means. Hmm, I remember from my economics class that marginal concepts usually refer to the additional effect of one more unit. So, marginal product must be about the additional output from using one more unit of something.

Let me look at the options one by one. Option A says it's the total output from a single unit. No, that doesn't sound right because marginal product is about the addition, not the total. Option B talks about the increase in total cost when more units are used. That's about cost, not output, so probably not B.

Option C is the cost of producing an extra unit. Again, that's about cost, not the product. D says it's the increase in total output when one more unit is added, keeping others constant. That sounds familiar. It's like the definition I rememberâ€”when you add one more unit of a factor while holding others steady, how much more output do you get.

E is the revenue from an additional unit. No, because that's revenue, not product. F is the ratio of output to the number of units used. That sounds like average product, not marginal. G is the added value of a unit of output, which I think relates to marginal revenue product, not just marginal product.

H is the average output per unit of factor. Again, that's average, not marginal. I is the decrease when a unit is removed. That's the opposite of marginal product. J is the profit from producing one more unit with an extra factor. That seems related but more about profit, not the product itself.

So putting it all together, the correct answer should be D. It directly addresses the increase in output from adding one more unit of the factor, holding others constant.

The marginal product of a productive factor refers to the increase in total output resulting from the addition of one more unit of that factor, while keeping the use of other factors constant. This aligns with option D, which accurately describes the concept.

Answer: D
