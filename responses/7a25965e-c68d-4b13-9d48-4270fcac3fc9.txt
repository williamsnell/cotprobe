Okay, so I need to figure out which option gives the best buy. That means I have to find out which option has the lowest price per bottle. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that to calculate the price per bottle, I should divide the total price by the number of bottles for each option. That will give me the cost per bottle, and then I can compare them all.

Let me list out the options again to make sure I have them all:

A: 7 bottles for $15.75
B: 5 bottles for $11.25
C: 9 bottles for $20.25
D: 4 bottles for $9.00
E: 11 bottles for $24.86
F: 12 bottles for $27.00
G: 16 bottles for $35.68
H: 18 bottles for $40.50
I: 14 bottles for $31.50
J: 3 bottles for $6.72

I think the best way is to calculate each one step by step.

Starting with option A: 7 bottles for $15.75. So, 15.75 divided by 7. Let me do that calculation. 15.75 ÷ 7 equals... 2.25. So each bottle is $2.25.

Option B: 5 bottles for $11.25. 11.25 ÷ 5. That's 2.25 as well. So same as A.

Option C: 9 bottles for $20.25. 20.25 ÷ 9. Hmm, 9 times 2.25 is 20.25, so that's also $2.25 per bottle. Wow, same as the first two.

Option D: 4 bottles for $9. So 9 ÷ 4. Let me calculate that. 4 goes into 9 two times, which is 8, with a remainder of 1. So 1 ÷ 4 is 0.25. So total is $2.25. Again, same as before.

Option E: 11 bottles for $24.86. Let's see, 24.86 ÷ 11. Hmm, 11 times 2 is 22, so 24.86 minus 22 is 2.86. Then, 2.86 ÷ 11 is approximately 0.26. So total is about $2.26 per bottle. That's slightly higher than the others so far.

Option F: 12 bottles for $27.00. So 27 ÷ 12. 12 times 2 is 24, so 27-24=3. 3 ÷12 is 0.25. So total is $2.25. So same as A, B, C, D.

Option G: 16 bottles for $35.68. So 35.68 ÷16. Let's see, 16 times 2 is 32. 35.68-32=3.68. 3.68 ÷16 is 0.23. So total is 2 + 0.23 = $2.23 per bottle. That's better than the previous ones. So G is cheaper per bottle.

Option H: 18 bottles for $40.50. 40.50 ÷18. 18 times 2 is 36. 40.50 -36=4.50. 4.50 ÷18 is 0.25. So total is 2 + 0.25= $2.25. Same as others.

Option I: 14 bottles for $31.50. 31.50 ÷14. 14 times 2 is 28. 31.50-28=3.50. 3.50 ÷14=0.25. So total is 2 +0.25= $2.25. Same as before.

Option J: 3 bottles for $6.72. So 6.72 ÷3. Let me calculate that. 3 goes into 6 twice. 6.72-6=0.72. 0.72 ÷3 is 0.24. So total is 2 +0.24= $2.24 per bottle. That's even lower than G.

Wait, so J is $2.24 per bottle, which is cheaper than G's $2.23? Let me double-check. 6.72 divided by 3 is indeed 2.24. So J is better than G.

Wait, but did I calculate G correctly? G is 35.68 ÷16. Let me do that again. 16 x 2=32, 35.68-32=3.68. 3.68 ÷16 is 0.23, so total is 2.23. So yes, J is 2.24, which is slightly higher than G's 2.23. So G is better than J.

Wait, no. 2.23 is lower than 2.24, so G is cheaper. So G is better than J.

Wait, but I thought I made a mistake earlier. Let me check again. 35.68 ÷16: 16 x 2=32, remainder 3.68. 3.68 ÷16: 3.68 divided by 16. Let me compute that. 16 x 0.23 is 3.68, right? Because 0.2 x16=3.2, and 0.03 x16=0.48, so 3.2+0.48=3.68. So yes, 0.23. So G is 2.23.

J is 6.72 ÷3=2.24. So G is cheaper per bottle.

Wait, but I thought J was lower because 2.24 is higher than 2.23, so G is better. So G is the best so far.

Wait, but let me check all the options again to make sure I didn't miss any.

Option A: 2.25

B: 2.25

C:2.25

D:2.25

E: ~2.26

F:2.25

G:2.23

H:2.25

I:2.25

J:2.24

So the lowest is G at 2.23, then J at 2.24, then the rest at 2.25 or higher.

Wait, but is there any option with lower than 2.23? Let me check all calculations again.

Option G: 16 bottles for $35.68. 35.68 ÷16.

Let me compute 35.68 ÷16:

16 x 2 =32. 35.68-32=3.68.

3.68 ÷16: 3.68 ÷16 = 0.23. So total is 2.23.

Option J: 3 bottles for $6.72. 6.72 ÷3=2.24.

So G is cheaper.

Wait, what about option E: 24.86 ÷11. Let me compute that again. 11 x 2=22. 24.86-22=2.86. 2.86 ÷11=0.26. So 2.26.

So yes, G is the cheapest.

Wait, but I thought I had another option. Let me check option I: 14 bottles for $31.50. 31.50 ÷14=2.25. Correct.

Option F: 12 bottles for $27.00. 27 ÷12=2.25.

So the calculations seem correct.

Therefore, the best buy is option G, which is 16 bottles for $35.68, at $2.23 per bottle.

The best buy is determined by calculating the price per bottle for each option. Option G has the lowest price per bottle at $2.23.
