<think>
Okay, so I have this problem about a spherical cast iron shell with an inside radius of 2.5 inches and an outside radius of 6 inches. The solution inside is releasing heat at a rate of 0.8 × 10^5 Btu/hr. The outside surface of the shell is kept at 120°F. I need to find the temperature at r = 5 inches, assuming steady state conditions and constant thermal conductivity of 45 Btu/hr-ft-°F.

Hmm, I remember from my studies that when dealing with heat transfer in spherical shells, we often use the concept of steady-state conduction. Since the shell is spherical, the heat transfer equation would involve spherical coordinates. The general solution for the temperature distribution in a spherical shell under steady-state conditions with constant thermal conductivity involves finding a function that satisfies Laplace's equation in spherical coordinates.

In steady-state, the temperature distribution in a spherical shell can be expressed as T(r) = A + B*(1/r), where A and B are constants determined by boundary conditions. Wait, no, that's for a sphere with a point heat source. For a spherical shell, maybe it's a bit different. Alternatively, I think the solution might involve a logarithmic term because the boundary conditions involve surface temperatures.

Wait, let me think again. The heat flux q is given, and the outside surface is at a fixed temperature. So, perhaps I should use the formula for heat transfer in a spherical shell. The general approach would be to use the conduction equation for spherical coordinates.

The heat equation in steady-state for spherical coordinates (assuming symmetry, so no angular dependence) is:

d²T/dr² + (2/r) dT/dr = 0

This is a second-order differential equation. To solve this, I can integrate it. Let me try integrating.

Let me set u = dT/dr. Then, du/dr = d²T/dr².

So, the equation becomes:

du/dr + (2/r) u = 0

Which is a separable equation. Rearranging:

du/u = -2 dr/r

Integrating both sides:

ln|u| = -2 ln r + C
=> u = C1 / r^2, where C1 is a constant.

So, dT/dr = C1 / r^2.

Integrate again to find T(r):

dT = C1 / r^2 dr

Integrate from some r to R, but more accurately, integrate from r to a point where r approaches infinity, but in this case, the shell has finite limits. Wait, perhaps I should integrate from r to r_outer or r_inner.

Wait, actually, the general solution for T(r) when solving the differential equation is:

T(r) = A + B ln(r)

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Let me check. When I integrated u = C1 / r^2, then integrating dT/dr = C1 / r².

The integral of 1/r² dr is -1/r + C. So,

dT = (C1 / r²) dr
Integrate:

T(r) = -C1 / r + C2

So the general solution is T(r) = A - B/r, where A and B are constants determined by boundary conditions.

So, now I have T(r) = A - B/r.

The boundary conditions are:

1. At r = r_inner = 2.5 inches, the heat flux is given by the internal heat generation. Wait, no, the heat is being liberated inside the shell, so perhaps that's the heat flux at r = r_inner. Alternatively, maybe the heat generation rate is given, so we need to relate that to the flux.

Wait, the problem states that the solution inside the shell liberates heat at a rate of 0.8e5 Btu/hr. So, that's the total heat transfer rate from the system. Since it's a steady state, the heat conducted out of the shell must equal the heat generated inside.

Alternatively, since the shell is a conductor, the heat generated is conducted outward. So, the total heat flow out of the shell is equal to the heat generated.

The heat flux q at r = r_inner (2.5 in) can be found using Fourier's law in spherical coordinates.

In spherical coordinates, the heat flux q is given by:

q = -k * (dT/dr) * (dA)

But since it's a spherical shell, the area element dA is 4πr² dr, but I think for heat flux in steady state, the heat flow rate (Q) is given by:

Q = -4π r² k (dT/dr) evaluated at r = r_inner, because that's where the heat is being generated.

Wait, no, I think the correct approach is that the heat generated per unit volume is given, but here, the problem states the total heat liberation rate is 0.8e5 Btu/hr. So, perhaps we can model this as a heat flux at r = r_inner.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me try to clarify.

In a spherical shell, the heat generated inside (at r = r_inner) would cause a heat flux outward. The total heat transfer rate Q is the heat flux multiplied by the surface area at r = r_inner.

So, Q = -4π r_inner² k (dT/dr) at r = r_inner.

But wait, the negative sign indicates direction, but since we're dealing with magnitudes, I can write:

Q = 4π r_inner² k (dT/dr) evaluated at r = r_inner.

Wait, no, Fourier's law is q = -k (dT/dr), so the heat flux is q = -k dT/dr. The negative sign indicates that heat flows from higher to lower temperature. So, the rate of heat transfer (Q) through a spherical surface of radius r is:

Q = -4π r² k (dT/dr)

So, at r = r_inner, the heat generated is Q = 0.8e5 Btu/hr.

So,

0.8e5 = -4π (2.5)^2 * 45 * (dT/dr at r=2.5)

Wait, but since heat is being generated, the temperature inside (at r=2.5) must be higher than the outside (r=6). So, dT/dr at r=2.5 should be negative, meaning T decreases as r increases, which makes sense.

So, let's compute this.

First, compute the left side:

Q = 0.8e5 Btu/hr.

Compute the right side:

-4π (2.5)^2 * 45 * (dT/dr at r=2.5) = Q.

So,

-4π (6.25) *45 * (dT/dr) = 0.8e5

Compute 4π *6.25 *45:

4 * π ≈ 12.566

12.566 *6.25 ≈ 78.5375

78.5375 *45 ≈ 3534.1875

So,

-3534.1875 * (dT/dr) = 0.8e5

So,

(dT/dr) = - (0.8e5) / 3534.1875

Compute 0.8e5 = 80,000.

80,000 /3534.1875 ≈ 22.63

So,

(dT/dr) at r=2.5 ≈ -22.63 °F/in.

So, dT/dr at r=2.5 is -22.63.

Now, from the general solution, T(r) = A - B/r.

So, dT/dr = B / r².

Wait, wait, earlier I thought dT/dr = -B/r², but in the general solution, T(r)=A - B/r, so dT/dr = B / r², but since the derivative is negative, perhaps I have the signs wrong.

Wait, let me check again. The general solution I found earlier was T(r) = A - B/r.

So, dT/dr = B / r².

Wait, but when I applied Fourier's law, I had q = -k dT/dr.

So, the heat flux is negative of k times dT/dr.

So, in this case, at r=2.5, the heat flux q = -k dT/dr.

So, q = -45 * (dT/dr).

But from the heat transfer equation, Q = q * (dA) ?

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the heat flux per unit area.

The heat flux q (W/m²) is given by Fourier's law as q = -k (dT/dr).

But in spherical coordinates, the heat flux per unit area is q = -k (dT/dr).

So, the total heat transfer rate Q is:

Q = q * 4π r².

So,

Q = (-k (dT/dr) ) * 4π r².

But since the heat is leaving the system, the negative sign indicates that dT/dr is negative (since T decreases as r increases, which makes sense).

So, substituting:

0.8e5 = (-45) * (dT/dr at r=2.5) * 4π (2.5)^2.

Wait, but the negative sign would make the RHS negative, so perhaps I should take absolute values.

Alternatively, since Q is positive (heat out), and dT/dr is negative, the equation becomes:

0.8e5 = 45 * |dT/dr| * 4π (2.5)^2.

So, let me compute that.

Compute 4π (2.5)^2 = 4 * π * 6.25 ≈ 78.54.

So,

0.8e5 = 45 * |dT/dr| * 78.54

So,

|dT/dr| = 0.8e5 / (45 *78.54)

Compute denominator: 45 *78.54 ≈ 3534.3.

So,

|dT/dr| ≈ 80000 / 3534.3 ≈ 22.63 °F/in.

Thus, dT/dr at r=2.5 is -22.63, as T decreases with r.

So, from the general solution, T(r) = A - B/r.

We have dT/dr = B / r².

At r=2.5, dT/dr = -22.63 = B / (2.5)^2.

So,

-22.63 = B / 6.25 → B = -22.63 *6.25 ≈ -141.4375.

So, B ≈ -141.4375.

So, T(r) = A + (141.4375)/r.

Wait, because from the general solution, T(r) = A - B/r, and B is positive if dT/dr is negative.

Wait, no, earlier I had T(r) = A - B/r, and dT/dr = B/r².

But in this case, dT/dr at r=2.5 is negative, so B must be positive because dT/dr = B/r² = positive, but in reality, dT/dr is negative. So perhaps I have a sign error here.

Wait, perhaps I should correct the signs.

Let me go back. The general solution is T(r) = A + (B ln(r)).

Wait, no, earlier I thought the solution was T(r) = A + B ln(r), but when solving the ODE, I got T(r) = A - B/r.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Let me rederive the solution.

The differential equation is:

d²T/dr² + (2/r) dT/dr = 0.

Let me make the substitution x = ln(r).

Then, d/dr = d/dx * dx/dr = (1/r) d/dx.

So,

d²T/dr² = d/dx (dT/dr) * (1/r) = (1/r) d²T/dx² * (1/r) )? Wait, perhaps better to compute directly.

Alternatively, let me try to solve the ODE correctly.

The equation is:

(1/r²) d/dr (r² dT/dr) ) = 0

Because for spherical coordinates, the Laplacian in steady-state is (1/r²) d/dr (r² dT/dr) ) = 0.

So,

d/dr (r² dT/dr) ) = 0.

Integrate once:

r² dT/dr = C → dT/dr = C / r².

Integrate again:

T(r) = -C / r + D.

So, T(r) = D - C/r.

So, the general solution is T(r) = A + B/(r), where A and B are constants.

Wait, but earlier I thought it was T(r) = A - B/r, but perhaps it's better to write it as T(r) = A + B/(r).

So, in this case, T(r) = A + B/(r).

Now, applying boundary conditions.

We have two boundary conditions:

1. At r = r_outer = 6 inches, T(r) = 120°F.

2. At r = r_inner = 2.5 inches, the heat flux is given by the internal heat generation, which we've calculated as dT/dr at r=2.5 is -22.63 °F/in.

So, let's apply the first boundary condition at r=6:

T(6) = A + B/6 = 120.

And from the heat flux condition at r=2.5:

dT/dr = -22.63 = B/(2.5)^2 → because dT/dr = B/(r²) = B/(6.25) = -22.63.

So,

B = (-22.63) *6.25 ≈ -141.4375.

So, B ≈ -141.4375.

Now, substitute B into the first equation:

A + (-141.4375)/6 = 120.

Compute (-141.4375)/6 ≈ -23.5729.

So,

A -23.5729 = 120 → A = 120 + 23.5729 ≈ 143.5729.

So, the temperature distribution is:

T(r) = 143.5729 - 141.4375 / r.

Now, we need to find T at r=5 inches.

So,

T(5) = 143.5729 - (141.4375 /5).

Compute 141.4375 /5 = 28.2875.

So,

T(5) ≈ 143.5729 -28.2875 ≈ 115.2854 °F.

Wait, but none of the options are around 115. The options are A:176, B:172, C:160, etc. So, this suggests I might have made a mistake.

Wait, that can't be right. I must have messed up somewhere.

Let me check my calculations again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sign when applying the heat flux condition.

Wait, dT/dr = B/(r²).

At r=2.5, dT/dr = -22.63 = B/(2.5)^2.

So,

B = (-22.63) * (2.5)^2 = (-22.63) *6.25 ≈ -141.4375.

Yes, that's correct.

Then, the temperature at 6 inches:

T(6) = A + B/6 = 120.

So,

A + (-141.4375)/6 = 120 → A -23.5729 =120 → A=143.5729.

So, T(r) = 143.5729 - 141.4375/r.

At r=5,

T(5)=143.5729 -141.4375/5 ≈143.5729 -28.2875=115.2854 °F.

But the options don't include 115, so I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I confused the inside and outside radii. The inside radius is 2.5 in, and the outside is 6 in. So, the shell is from r=2.5 to r=6.

Wait, but the heat is generated inside the shell, so the solution is inside the shell, which is from r=2.5 to r=6. So, the heat is generated within this shell, and it's conducted outward.

But wait, the shell is a sphere, so the solution is in the annular region between r=2.5 and r=6.

Wait, but the heat is generated within the shell, so the total heat generated is 0.8e5 Btu/hr, which is conducted out through the outer surface at 120°F.

Wait, perhaps I should model this as a spherical shell with internal heat generation.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to consider the heat flux at r=2.5 as the heat being generated, and the outer surface at r=6 has T=120°F.

Wait, but the heat generated inside the shell would cause a temperature gradient from r=2.5 to r=6, with T higher at 2.5 and lower at 6, which is the opposite of what I found earlier.

Wait, that can't be right because the outside is at 120°F, and the inside (solution) would be hotter, so T at 2.5 should be higher than T at 6.

So, in my earlier calculation, I have T(r=5) as 115, which is lower than 120, which can't be correct because 5 is between 2.5 and 6, so T should decrease from 2.5 to 6.

Wait, that's correct. If T at 2.5 is higher than at 6, then at r=5, it should be between those two.

But according to my calculation, T(5)=115.28, which is less than 120, which is at r=6. That can't be right because T should decrease from 2.5 to 6.

Wait, but 115 is less than 120, which would mean that T at 5 is lower than at 6, which is impossible because the heat is leaving at 6, so T should be higher at 2.5 than at 6.

Wait, I must have made a mistake in applying the boundary conditions.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the heat flux direction again.

The heat is generated inside the shell, so the solution is inside the shell, which is between r=2.5 and r=6.

The heat flows from higher T to lower T. So, at r=2.5, the temperature is higher, and at r=6, it's 120°F.

So, the temperature distribution should decrease from 2.5 to 6.

In my solution, T(r=5) is 115, which is lower than T(r=6)=120, which is impossible because 5 is between 2.5 and 6. So, I must have messed up the signs.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express the general solution correctly.

Let me go back.

The general solution for steady-state heat conduction in a spherical shell is T(r) = A + B ln(r). Wait, no, earlier I thought it was T(r) = A + B/(r), but perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, no, the solution to (1/r²) d/dr (r² dT/dr) )=0 is T(r) = A + B ln(r).

Wait, that's right. Because when you solve the ODE, the solution is T(r) = A + B ln(r).

Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier when I thought the solution was T(r) = A - B/r. That's incorrect. The correct solution is T(r) = A + B ln(r).

Wait, let me rederive it properly.

The equation is (1/r²) d/dr (r² dT/dr) )=0.

Integrate once:

d/dr (r² dT/dr) )= C.

Integrate again:

r² dT/dr = C r + D.

Wait, no, integrating d/dr (r² dT/dr) )= C gives:

r² dT/dr = C r + D.

So,

dT/dr = (C r + D)/(r²) = C/(r) + D/(r²).

Integrate again:

T(r) = C ln(r) + D/r + E.

But in the case of a spherical shell with finite r limits, we can set E=0 because the solution is finite at r=0, so the general solution is T(r) = A ln(r) + B.

Wait, but that's for the entire sphere. In a shell between r_inner and r_outer, perhaps the solution is different.

Wait, perhaps I should look for a solution that satisfies the boundary conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps the solution is T(r) = A + B ln(r). 

Wait, let me check. The ODE is (1/r²) d/dr (r² dT/dr) )=0.

So,

d/dr (r² dT/dr) )=0 → r² dT/dr = C → dT/dr = C/(r²).

Integrate:

T(r) = -C/(r) + D.

So, T(r) = D - C/r.

Ah, so I was correct earlier. The general solution is T(r) = A + B/(r), where A and B are constants.

Wait, but that gives T(r) = A + B/(r), not involving ln(r). So, perhaps I was right the first time.

Wait, but when I applied the boundary conditions, I ended up with T(r=6)=120 and dT/dr at r=2.5 = -22.63.

So, with T(r)=A + B/r.

Then,

At r=6: A + B/6 = 120.

At r=2.5: dT/dr = -B/(2.5)^2 = -22.63 → B/(6.25)=22.63 → B=22.63 *6.25 ≈141.4375.

So, B≈141.4375.

Then, from T(6):

A + (141.4375)/6 = 120 → A +23.5729 =120 → A=96.4271.

So, T(r)=96.4271 +141.4375/r.

Wait, but then at r=2.5,

T(2.5)=96.4271 +141.4375/2.5 ≈96.4271 +56.575≈153°F.

At r=6,

T(6)=96.4271 +141.4375/6 ≈96.4271 +23.5729≈120°F, which matches.

Now, at r=5,

T(5)=96.4271 +141.4375/5 ≈96.4271 +28.2875≈124.7146°F.

But this is higher than the outside temperature of 120°F, which can't be right because T should decrease from r=2.5 to r=6.

Wait, this suggests that T(r=5)=124.7°F, which is higher than T(r=6)=120°F, which is correct because as r increases, T decreases.

So, T(r=5)=~124.7°F.

But looking at the options, the closest is option J:170°F, but that's much higher.

Wait, this can't be right because according to this, T(r=5)=~125°F, but the options don't have that.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the heat flux calculation.

Wait, let's recalculate the heat flux.

Given that the heat generated inside the shell is 0.8e5 Btu/hr.

The heat flux at r=2.5 is given by:

Q = -4π r² k (dT/dr) at r=2.5.

But since the heat is leaving the system, we can write:

Q = 4π r² k (dT/dr) at r=2.5, because dT/dr is negative.

So,

0.8e5 = 4π*(2.5)^2*45*(dT/dr at r=2.5).

Compute 4π*(2.5)^2 =4*3.1416*6.25≈78.54.

So,

0.8e5 =78.54 *45 * (dT/dr).

Compute 78.54*45≈3534.3.

So,

0.8e5 =3534.3 * (dT/dr).

So,

dT/dr =80000 /3534.3≈22.63.

But since the heat is leaving, dT/dr is negative. So, dT/dr =-22.63.

So, in the general solution T(r)=A + B/r,

dT/dr = -B/(r²).

So,

- B/(2.5)^2 = -22.63 → B/(6.25) =22.63 → B=22.63 *6.25≈141.4375.

So, B≈141.4375.

Then, applying T(6)=120,

A +141.4375/6=120 → A +23.5729=120 → A≈96.4271.

So, T(r)=96.4271 +141.4375/r.

At r=5,

T=96.4271 +141.4375/5=96.4271 +28.2875≈124.7146°F.

But the options don't have this value. So, perhaps I have a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the heat is generated within the shell, and the shell itself has a certain thermal conductivity. So, perhaps the heat is conducted through the shell, and the solution is inside. Wait, the problem says the shell contains a solution which liberates heat. So, the heat is generated inside the shell, which is the region between r=2.5 and r=6.

Wait, but the shell is made of cast iron, so it's the conductor. The solution is inside, generating heat at 0.8e5 Btu/hr.

Wait, perhaps I should model the problem as a spherical shell with internal heat generation, with the outer surface at T=120°F.

So, the general solution for T(r) in such a case would involve a logarithmic term.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula for temperature distribution in a spherical shell with internal heat generation.

The solution for T(r) in a spherical shell (r_inner < r < r_outer) with internal heat generation (q_gen) and fixed temperature at r_outer is given by:

T(r) = T_outer + (q_gen / (4π k)) * ln(r/r_outer) + (q_gen / (4π k)) * [1/(r) - 1/(r_outer)].

Wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, the solution might be:

T(r) = T_outer + (q_gen / (4π k)) [ ln(r_outer/r) + 1 - (r_inner)/(r_outer) ) ].

Wait, perhaps I should look up the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use the method of separation of variables.

The general solution for T(r) in a spherical shell is:

T(r) = A ln(r) + B.

But applying boundary conditions.

At r_outer, T(r_outer)=T_outer=120°F.

At r_inner, the heat flux is given by q = q_gen/(4π r_inner²), because the total heat generated is q_gen=0.8e5 Btu/hr, so the heat flux per unit area at r_inner is q = q_gen/(4π r_inner²).

Wait, that makes sense. The total heat generated is q_gen=0.8e5 Btu/hr, so the heat flux at r_inner is q = q_gen/(4π r_inner²).

So,

q = 0.8e5 / (4π (2.5)^2).

Compute denominator:4π*(6.25)=78.54.

So,

q ≈80000 /78.54 ≈1018.59 Btu/hr·ft².

Wait, no, because r is in inches, but k is in Btu/hr·ft·°F.

Wait, units are important here.

Wait, r is in inches, but thermal conductivity is given in Btu/hr·ft·°F. So, I need to convert r to feet.

r_inner=2.5 inches=2.5/12≈0.2083 feet.

r_outer=6 inches=0.5 feet.

So, the shell is from r=0.2083 ft to r=0.5 ft.

So, the area at r_inner is 4π (0.2083)^2.

So, the heat flux q at r_inner is:

q = Q_gen / (4π r_inner²) =0.8e5 / (4π (0.2083)^2).

Compute denominator:4π*(0.2083)^2≈4*3.1416*(0.0434)≈0.5434.

So,

q≈80000 /0.5434≈147235 Btu/hr·ft².

Now, Fourier's law in spherical coordinates gives:

q = -k (dT/dr) at r=r_inner.

So,

147235 = -45 * (dT/dr at r=0.2083).

So,

(dT/dr at r=0.2083) = -147235 /45 ≈-3272.33 °F/ft.

Wait, that's a very large value. Let me check the units.

Wait, k is in Btu/hr·ft·°F.

q is in Btu/hr·ft².

So,

q = -k (dT/dr) → (Btu/hr·ft²) = (Btu/hr·ft·°F) * (°F/ft).

So, units match.

So, dT/dr at r=0.2083 ft is -3272.33 °F/ft.

Now, the general solution is T(r) = A ln(r) + B.

So, dT/dr = A/(r).

At r=0.2083,

A/(0.2083) = -3272.33 → A = -3272.33 *0.2083 ≈-680.7.

So, A≈-680.7.

Now, apply the boundary condition at r=0.5 ft (r_outer):

T(0.5)=120 = A ln(0.5) + B.

Compute ln(0.5)= -0.6931.

So,

120 = (-680.7)*(-0.6931) + B → 120 ≈471.3 + B → B≈120-471.3≈-351.3.

So, the temperature distribution is:

T(r) = -680.7 ln(r) -351.3.

Now, we need to find T at r=5 inches=5/12≈0.4167 ft.

So,

T(0.4167) = -680.7 * ln(0.4167) -351.3.

Compute ln(0.4167)= ln(5/12)= ln(0.4167)≈-0.8755.

So,

T≈-680.7*(-0.8755) -351.3 ≈600.5 -351.3≈249.2°F.

But this is way higher than the options given, which are around 150-190°F.

I must have made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps I should model the problem differently. Since the shell is a conductor, the heat generated inside the shell (between r=2.5 and r=6 inches) must be conducted outward, so the temperature distribution would be T(r) = T_outer + (q_gen/(4πk)) [ (1/r) - (1/r_outer) ].

Wait, perhaps this is the correct formula.

The general solution for a spherical shell with internal heat generation q_gen and fixed outer temperature T_outer is:

T(r) = T_outer + (q_gen/(4πk)) (1/r - 1/r_outer).

Wait, let's check the dimensions.

q_gen is in Btu/hr.

4πk is in Btu/hr·ft·°F * ft² (since 1/r has units of 1/ft, so 1/r - 1/r_outer is unitless? Wait, no, 1/r is 1/ft, so the term is 1/ft.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

T(r) = T_outer + (q_gen/(4πk)) [ (1/r) - (1/r_outer) ].

Let me try that.

Given:

q_gen=0.8e5 Btu/hr.

k=45 Btu/hr·ft·°F.

r_outer=6 inches=0.5 ft.

r_inner=2.5 inches≈0.2083 ft.

But wait, the shell is from r_inner=2.5 to r_outer=6, but the formula I'm using is for internal heat generation within the shell. So, perhaps the formula applies.

So,

T(r) =120 + (0.8e5 / (4π *45)) [ (1/r) - (1/0.5) ].

Compute the constant term:

0.8e5=80000.

4π*45≈565.487.

So,

80000/565.487≈141.43.

So,

T(r)=120 +141.43 [ (1/r) -2 ].

Now, at r=5 inches=5/12≈0.4167 ft.

So,

T=120 +141.43 [ (1/0.4167) -2 ].

Compute 1/0.4167≈2.4.

So,

2.4 -2=0.4.

Thus,

T=120 +141.43*0.4≈120 +56.57≈176.57°F.

This matches option A:176°F.

So, the correct answer is A.

To determine the temperature at \( r = 5 \) inches in a spherical cast iron shell with an inside radius of 2.5 inches and an outside radius of 6 inches, we analyze the heat transfer under steady-state conditions. The shell contains a solution that liberates heat at a rate of \( 0.8 \times 10^5 \, \text{Btu/hr} \), and the outside surface is maintained at \( 120^\circ \text{F} \). The thermal conductivity of cast iron is \( 45 \, \text{Btu/hr-ft-}^\circ \text{F} \).

### Key Steps:
1. **Heat Flux at \( r = 2.5 \) inches**:
   The heat flux \( q \) at the inner surface is calculated using the total heat generation:
   \[
   q = \frac{Q_{\text{gen}}}{4 \pi r_{\text{inner}}^2} = \frac{0.8 \times 10^5}{4 \pi (2.5)^2} \approx 147235 \, \text{Btu/hr-ft}^2.
   \]
   Using Fourier's law, \( q = -k \frac{dT}{dr} \), we find:
   \[
   \frac{dT}{dr} \bigg|_{r=2.5} = -\frac{q}{k} = -\frac{147235}{45} \approx -3272.33 \, ^\circ \text{F/ft}.
   \]

2. **General Solution for Temperature Distribution**:
   The temperature distribution in a spherical shell with internal heat generation and fixed outer temperature is:
   \[
   T(r) = T_{\text{outer}} + \frac{Q_{\text{gen}}}{4 \pi k} \left( \frac{1}{r} - \frac{1}{r_{\text{outer}}} \right).
   \]
   Substituting the given values:
   \[
   T(r) = 120 + \frac{0.8 \times 10^5}{4 \pi \times 45} \left( \frac{1}{r} - \frac{1}{0.5} \right).
   \]
   Compute the constant term:
   \[
   \frac{0.8 \times 10^5}{4 \pi \times 45} \approx 141.43.
   \]
   Thus:
   \[
   T(r) = 120 + 141.43 \left( \frac{1}{r} - 2 \right).
   \]

3. **Temperature at \( r = 5 \) inches**:
   Convert \( r = 5 \) inches to feet: \( r = \frac{5}{12} \approx 0.4167 \, \text{ft} \). Substitute into the temperature equation:
   \[
   T(0.4167) = 120 + 141.43 \left( \frac{1}{0.4167} - 2 \right).
   \]
   Compute \( \frac{1}{0.4167} \approx 2.4 \), so:
   \[
   T(0.4167) = 120 + 141.43 (2.4 - 2) = 120 + 141.43 \times 0.4 \approx 120 + 56.57 = 176.57^\circ \text{F}.
   \]

### Final Answer:
The temperature at \( r = 5 \) inches is approximately \( 176^\circ \text{F} \), corresponding to **Option A**.
