Question:

Explain the 'END OF FILE Condition' method of ending a Explain the 'END OF FILE Condition' method of ending a programin PL/I.

Options:

A: The end-file condition occurs when a special end-of-file character is encountered within the file's data.
B: The end-file condition occurs when the file is not found
C: The end-file condition occurs when the operating system signals the end of a file due to a timeout.
D: The end-file condition occurs when the file is manually closed by the user during the execution of the program.
E: The end-file condition occurs when an attempt is made to acquire data from the input file after the last data from the file has already been read.
F: The end-file condition occurs when the file reaches a certain size limit during data writing.
G: The end-file condition occurs when the file is corrupted
H: The end-file condition occurs when the file's read permission is revoked while the program is running.
I: The end-file condition is triggered by a specific keyword written into the file.

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about the 'END OF FILE Condition' in PL/I. I'm a bit rusty on PL/I, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking about how the END OF FILE condition is used to end a program. Let's see the options.

Option A says it's when a special end-of-file character is encountered. From what I remember, in some programming languages, like C, you might check for EOF by seeing if a read operation returns nothing. But in PL/I, I think it's more about the operating system signaling when the end is reached, not a specific character. So maybe A isn't the right choice.

Option B mentions the file not being found. That sounds more like an error condition when trying to open the file, not the end of processing it once it's open. So B is probably not it.

Option C talks about a timeout. I don't think timeouts are related to EOF conditions. EOF is about the data, not time. So C is likely incorrect.

Option D says the file is manually closed by the user. Well, the program might close the file, but the end of file condition is more about the program detecting that it's reached the end, not the user manually closing it. So D doesn't seem right.

Option E: The end-file condition occurs when attempting to read after the last data. This rings a bell. I think in PL/I, when you read from a file and there's no more data, the end-file condition is triggered. So E might be the correct answer.

Option F is about the file reaching a size limit during writing. That sounds like something related to file limits, maybe in operating systems, but not the EOF condition in PL/I. So F is probably not correct.

Option G mentions a corrupted file. Corruption would cause errors, but not the EOF condition specifically. So G is out.

Option H: File read permission revoked. That's more of an access error, not an end-of-file scenario. So H is not the answer.

Option I: Triggered by a specific keyword. I don't recall PL/I using keywords like that to signal EOF. It's more about the data reading process. So I is likely incorrect.

Putting it all together, the correct answer should be E because the EOF condition is when the program tries to read beyond the last data available in the file.

The correct answer is E because the END OF FILE condition in PL/I is triggered when the program attempts to read data from a file after all the data has already been read.
