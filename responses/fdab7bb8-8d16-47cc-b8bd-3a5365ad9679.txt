Okay, so I need to figure out which option corresponds to the definition given in the question. The question is asking about the last part of the definition: "the act or practice of killing or allowing someone to die." Let me break this down.

First, the options are A to D: murder, ethical killing, suicide, euthanasia. I'll go through each one to see which fits best.

Murder (A) is the unlawful killing of another person. So that's about killing, but it's specifically unlawful and without justification. The question's definition is broader, including allowing someone to die, which isn't exactly what murder is. Murder is more about the act of killing, not the omission of not saving someone.

Ethical killing (B) sounds like it's about killing done for moral reasons, maybe in a way that's considered right. But the term in the question is neutral, not necessarily about ethics. It's just the act of killing or letting die, so I'm not sure if B is the right fit.

Suicide (C) is when a person intentionally takes their own life. That fits the "allowing someone to die" part, but only in the context of oneself. The question seems to be about a general act, not specifically about self-inflicted death.

Euthanasia (D) refers to the act of intentionally causing the death of a person to relieve their suffering. This can be either active, like giving a lethal injection, or passive, like withholding treatment. So euthanasia involves either killing or allowing someone to die, which aligns perfectly with the definition given in the question.

Putting it all together, the correct answer should be D, euthanasia.

The correct answer is D, euthanasia, as it involves the act of killing or allowing someone to die, fitting the definition provided.

Answer: D
