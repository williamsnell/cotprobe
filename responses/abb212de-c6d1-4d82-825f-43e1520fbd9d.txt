Okay, so I have this question about monetary policy in open versus closed economies. I'm a bit rusty on my macroeconomics, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says Economy X is an open economy with flexible exchange rates, and Economy Y is closed. We're looking at the effectiveness of expansionary monetary policy in both. The options are about whether it's more, less, equally effective, and why.

First, I remember that expansionary monetary policy usually involves actions like lowering interest rates or increasing the money supply. The goal is to stimulate economic activity—so more investment, consumption, etc.

In an open economy (Economy X), when a central bank implements expansionary policy, interest rates go down because of lower rates or more money in the system. Lower interest rates can lead to increased investment at home. But since it's an open economy, lower interest rates might also attract foreign investors bringing in capital. Wait, no—wait, if domestic interest rates are lower than foreign, wouldn't that cause capital outflows? Because people might invest their money where the returns are higher. Hmm, maybe I got that wrong. Let me think: if the central bank lowers rates, the cost of borrowing decreases, so more people borrow and invest. But for the currency, lower rates could make the currency less attractive, leading to depreciation. A weaker currency makes exports cheaper and imports more expensive, so net exports would increase. That's a positive for the economy.

But wait, in an open economy, when you have expansionary policy, the exchange rate might depreciate, which boosts net exports. So the multiplier effect here would be stronger because the policy not only affects domestic spending (like consumption and investment) but also has an impact through the exchange rate on net exports. So the overall effect is larger because of the trade channel.

In contrast, a closed economy (Economy Y) doesn't have the net exports factor because it doesn't engage in international trade. So the same expansionary policy would only affect the economy through the interest rate and money supply channels. The effect might be weaker because there's no boost from net exports; the stimulus is only from domestic investment and consumption.

So putting it together, expansionary monetary policy in an open economy (X) would lead to more effective results because the lower interest rates (or higher money supply) would not only stimulate domestic demand but also cause the currency to depreciate, increasing net exports. This dual effect makes the policy more powerful in X compared to Y, where the policy only affects the economy through the domestic channels.

Looking at the options, option A says it's more effective in X because the policy increases net exports. That seems to fit with what I was thinking. Option B says decreases net exports, which I don't think is right because lower rates would make the currency weaker, making exports cheaper and thus increasing net exports. Option C says equally effective, but I think X is more effective. Options D says less effective, which contradicts my conclusion.

So the answer should be A.

The effectiveness of expansionary monetary policy differs between open and closed economies. In an open economy (X), such as one with flexible exchange rates, expansionary policies like lowering interest rates can lead to currency depreciation. This depreciation makes exports cheaper and imports more expensive, thereby increasing net exports. Additionally, lower interest rates stimulate domestic investment. The dual effect of increased domestic demand and enhanced net exports makes the policy more potent in an open economy. In contrast, a closed economy (Y) lacks the net exports channel, so the policy's impact is limited to domestic factors, making it less effective. Therefore, expansionary monetary policy is more effective in Economy X because it increases net exports.
