Okay, I've got this problem here about oxygen transport in blood. Let me try to break it down step by step. So the question is about calculating the number of moles of O2 per liter of blood and then figuring out how many hemoglobin molecules are needed to carry that oxygen.

First, the problem states that one liter of fully oxygenated blood can carry 0.18 liters of O2 at 298 K and 1.00 atm. I remember that the ideal gas law, PV = nRT, is useful for finding the number of moles (n) of a gas given its volume, pressure, and temperature.

So, I'll plug in the values into the formula. P is 1.00 atm, V is 0.18 L, R is the gas constant which I think is 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K), and T is 298 K. Rearranging the formula to solve for n gives n = (PV)/(RT).

Calculating that: (1.00 atm * 0.18 L) / (0.0821 * 298). Let me compute the denominator first. 0.0821 multiplied by 298 is approximately 24.4658. So, numerator is 0.18, so 0.18 divided by 24.4658. Let me see, 0.18 / 24.4658 is roughly 0.00736 moles. So that's about 7.36e-3 moles of O2 per liter.

Wait, but the problem is asking for the number of moles per liter of blood, which matches what I just found, so that's part one done.

Next part: Hemoglobin has four oxygen binding sites. So each hemoglobin molecule can carry four O2 molecules. Wait, no, wait. Each binding site binds one O2 molecule, so each hemoglobin can carry four O2 molecules. So for each mole of hemoglobin, it can carry 4 moles of O2.

But wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. Each hemoglobin molecule can bind four O2 molecules. So each hemoglobin can transport four O2 molecules. So to find how many hemoglobin molecules are needed to carry the O2 in 1 L of blood, I need to know how many moles of O2 are present and then find how many moles of hemoglobin are needed, considering each carries four O2.

Wait, no. Each hemoglobin can carry four O2 molecules, so the number of O2 molecules per hemoglobin is four times the number of hemoglobin molecules. Alternatively, the moles of O2 is four times the moles of hemoglobin. So, moles of O2 = 4 * moles of hemoglobin. So to get moles of hemoglobin, I'd do moles of O2 divided by 4.

Wait, but let me make sure. Suppose one hemoglobin carries four O2 molecules. So each hemoglobin contributes four O2 molecules. So if I have n moles of hemoglobin, they can carry 4n moles of O2.

So, given that we have 0.00736 moles of O2, the number of moles of hemoglobin required would be (0.00736) / 4 = 0.00184 moles.

Wait, but that seems really small. Let me double-check. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, one mole of hemoglobin can carry four moles of O2. So yes, the moles of hemoglobin would be (moles of O2) / 4.

But wait, another approach: the number of molecules. Let's think in terms of molecules instead of moles. Each hemoglobin can carry 4 O2 molecules. So the total O2 molecules in 1 L of blood is n_O2 = 0.00736 moles * Avogadro's number (6.022e23 molecules/mol) = 0.00736 * 6.022e23 ≈ 4.43e21 molecules.

Each hemoglobin can carry 4 O2, so the number of hemoglobin molecules needed is (4.43e21) / 4 = 1.1075e21 molecules. Wait, that's approximately 1.11e21, which would correspond to option A.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making any mistakes here. Let me go through it again.

So, part 1: Find moles of O2. PV = nRT. P=1 atm, V=0.18 L, R=0.0821, T=298 K.

n = (1 * 0.18) / (0.0821 * 298) = 0.18 / (24.4658) ≈ 0.00736 moles. So that's 7.36e-3 moles of O2 per liter.

Part 2: Each hemoglobin carries 4 O2 molecules. So the number of hemoglobin molecules needed would be (moles of O2) / 4 * Avogadro's number.

Wait, no. Because moles of O2 is 7.36e-3, which is 7.36e-3 * 6.022e23 = 4.43e21 molecules. Each hemoglobin carries 4 molecules, so 4.43e21 /4 = 1.1075e21 hemoglobin molecules. So that's approximately 1.11e21, which is option A.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes hemoglobin is considered per red blood cell, but the question is about the number of hemoglobin molecules, not cells. So each RBC has about 250 million hemoglobin molecules, but that's perhaps irrelevant here.

Wait, but let me check the calculation again. 0.00736 moles of O2, each mole being 6.022e23 molecules, gives 0.00736 * 6.022e23 = 4.43e21 O2 molecules.

Each hemoglobin carries 4 O2, so the number of hemoglobin molecules is 4.43e21 /4 = 1.1075e21. So that's 1.11e21, which is option A.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is 1.11e21. So that's the answer. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation. Let me check the ideal gas law again.

n = (1.00 * 0.18) / (0.0821 * 298). 0.0821 * 298 is 24.4658. 0.18 /24.4658 is approximately 0.007367 moles. Yes.

So, yeah, the number of hemoglobin molecules needed is (0.007367 * 6.022e23) /4 = (4.435e21) /4 = 1.10875e21, which rounds to 1.11e21, so option A.

To calculate the number of moles of $\mathrm{O}_2$ carried per liter of blood, we use the ideal gas law, $PV = nRT$. Given $P = 1.00 \, \mathrm{atm}$, $V = 0.18 \, \mathrm{L}$, $R = 0.0821 \, \mathrm{L \cdot atm / (mol \cdot K)}$, and $T = 298 \, \mathrm{K}$, we solve for $n$:

\[
n = \frac{PV}{RT} = \frac{(1.00)(0.18)}{(0.0821)(298)} \approx 0.00736 \, \mathrm{mol}.
\]

Thus, one liter of blood carries approximately $0.00736 \, \mathrm{mol}$ of $\mathrm{O}_2$.

Next, we calculate the number of hemoglobin molecules required. Each hemoglobin molecule can bind four $\mathrm{O}_2$ molecules. The total number of $\mathrm{O}_2$ molecules in one liter of blood is:

\[
n_{\mathrm{O}_2} \times N_A = (0.00736 \, \mathrm{mol}) \times (6.022 \times 10^{23} \, \mathrm{molecules/mol}) \approx 4.43 \times 10^{21} \, \mathrm{molecules}.
\]

Since each hemoglobin molecule carries four $\mathrm{O}_2$ molecules, the number of hemoglobin molecules required is:

\[
\frac{4.43 \times 10^{21}}{4} \approx 1.11 \times 10^{21}.
\]

Thus, approximately $1.11 \times 10^{21}$ hemoglobin molecules are needed to transport the $\mathrm{O}_2$ in one liter of fully oxygenated blood.
