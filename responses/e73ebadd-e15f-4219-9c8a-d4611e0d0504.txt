Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a block of wood floating in water. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is asking about the volume of the block that's above water when it's afloat. The options are from A to J, but I'm not sure which one is correct yet. Let me break it down.

First, the block has a density of 0.80 g/cm³. Wait, density is mass over volume, right? So density (ρ) = mass (m) / volume (V). The block weighs 1.0 kg. Oh, wait, but the density is given in grams per cm³, so maybe I should convert the mass to grams for consistency. 1 kg is 1000 grams. Okay, so mass m = 1000 g, density ρ = 0.80 g/cm³.

The first thing I need to find is the total volume of the block. Using the formula, V = m / ρ. So plugging in the numbers: V = 1000 g / 0.80 g/cm³. Let me do that division. 1000 divided by 0.8 is... 1250 cm³. So the total volume of the block is 1250 cm³.

Now, the block is floating, so it displaces its own weight in water. Wait, the note says that a floating object displaces its own weight of water. So the weight of the displaced water equals the weight of the block. Since the block weighs 1.0 kg, which is 1000 grams, the displaced water must also weigh 1000 grams.

Water's density is 1.00 g/cm³, right? So the volume of the displaced water would be the mass divided by density. So V_displaced = 1000 g / 1.00 g/cm³ = 1000 cm³. That means the submerged part of the block is 1000 cm³ under water.

The total volume of the block is 1250 cm³, and 1000 cm³ is submerged. So the volume above water would be the total volume minus the submerged volume: 1250 cm³ - 1000 cm³ = 250 cm³. So the block has 250 cm³ above water.

Wait, but let me double-check. The block's density is less than water, so it floats. The fraction submerged is the block's density over water's density. So fraction submerged = 0.80 / 1.00 = 0.8, or 80%. So 80% of the block's volume is underwater, and 20% is above. 20% of 1250 is 250 cm³. Yep, that matches.

Looking at the options, option B is 250 cm³. So the answer should be B.

The block of wood has a density of 0.80 g/cm³ and a mass of 1.0 kg (1000 g). Its total volume is calculated as \( V = \frac{m}{\rho} = \frac{1000}{0.80} = 1250 \, \text{cm}^3 \). When floating, it displaces water equal to its weight, which is 1000 g, corresponding to a displaced water volume of \( 1000 \, \text{cm}^3 \). The submerged volume is therefore 1000 cm³, leaving \( 1250 - 1000 = 250 \, \text{cm}^3 \) above water. Thus, the volume above the water surface is 250 cm³.

Answer: B
