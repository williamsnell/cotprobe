Okay, so I've got this question about depreciation using the declining-balance method. Let's try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll do my best.

Alright, the problem is about the Five Star Hotel which put down $3,000 worth of carpeting. The carpeting is expected to last five years. The accountant wants to use the declining-balance method, and we need to find the depreciation for the second year.

First, I remember that the declining-balance method is an accelerated depreciation method. That means the asset depreciates more in the early years and less in the later years. It's often used for assets that lose their value quickly, like electronics or, in this case, carpeting.

I think the formula for declining-balance is something like Depreciation = Book Value × Depreciation Rate. The book value is the asset's value minus any accumulated depreciation. The depreciation rate is usually based on the straight-line rate, but for declining-balance, it's applied at a higher rate, often double.

Wait, no, the straight-line rate is calculated as 1 divided by the useful life. So for five years, the straight-line rate would be 1/5, which is 20% per year. But in declining-balance, I think we use double that rate, so 40% per year. Or wait, maybe it's just the straight-line rate, not necessarily doubled. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused.

Let me clarify. The straight-line depreciation rate is 1 divided by the useful life. So for five years, that's 20% each year. But the declining-balance method uses a higher rate, which is 1.5 times the straight-line rate, or 30% in this case. Wait, no, I'm mixing things up. Actually, the declining-balance method typically uses a rate that's higher than the straight-line. For example, double the straight-line rate. So if straight-line is 20%, then declining-balance would be 40% each year.

Wait, but I'm not sure if the question specifies a rate, or if it's just using the straight-line rate multiplied by 150% or something. Hmm, the question doesn't give a specific rate, so I think it's safe to assume that the rate is 150% of the straight-line rate. So 150% of 20% is 30% per year.

Wait, no, maybe it's just the straight-line rate, not multiplied. Let me think again. Oh, wait, the standard declining-balance method uses a rate of 150% of the straight-line rate. So straight-line is 20%, so the rate here would be 30%.

So first, let's calculate the straight-line rate: 1/5 = 20%. Then, the declining-balance rate is 1.5 × 20% = 30%.

Now, the initial cost is $3,000. The first year's depreciation would be 30% of $3,000, which is $900. So the book value at the end of the first year would be $3,000 - $900 = $2,100.

For the second year, we take 30% of the new book value, which is $2,100. So 30% of 2,100 is 0.3 × 2,100 = $630. Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see $630. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the rate. Maybe the rate is 20% each year, not 30%. Let me try that. So straight-line rate is 20%, and if we're using double the rate, that would be 40% per year. So first year's depreciation would be 40% of 3,000, which is $1,200. Book value at end of year one is $1,800.

Then, second year's depreciation would be 40% of $1,800, which is $720. Looking at the options, H is $720. That seems to be an option.

Wait, but I think I'm getting confused between the methods. Let me double-check. So, the straight-line rate is 20%, so the declining-balance rate is 1.5 times that, which is 30%. So first year's dep is 30% of 3k = 900, book value is 2,100. Second year: 30% of 2,100 is 630. But that's not an option. So maybe I'm wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the rate is double the straight-line rate, which would be 40%. So first year: 40% of 3k = 1,200. Book value 1,800. Second year: 40% of 1,800 = 720, which is option H.

But wait, another thought: in some cases, the rate is 150% of straight-line, which would be 30%. So first year is $900, second year is $630. But 630 isn't an option. So maybe the rate is 200% of straight-line, which is 40%. So then, the second year's depreciation is $720, which is option H.

Alternatively, maybe the question is using the straight-line rate as 20%, and the declining-balance is using that same rate, not double. That would mean first year is $600, second year $480. But that doesn't seem right because the point of declining-balance is to accelerate depreciation.

Wait, but the options don't have $600 as the second year's depreciation. Let me see the options again: A:900, B:1,440, C:1,000, D:300, E:960, F:600, G:1,200, H:720, I:1,800, J:480.

If I'm using 30% as the rate, first year is 900, second is 630, which isn't an option. So perhaps the rate is 40%? So first year 1,200, second 720, which is option H.

Wait, but let me make sure. The formula for declining-balance is: depreciation each year is (book value) × (rate). The rate is usually 200% of straight-line, so 40%. So first year: 3000 × 0.4 = 1200. Second year: (3000 - 1200) × 0.4 = 1800 × 0.4 = 720. So the second year's depreciation is $720, which is option H.

Yes, that makes sense. So the answer should be H: $720.
</think>

The correct answer is H: $720.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Determine the Straight-Line Depreciation Rate:**  
   The asset's useful life is 5 years, so the straight-line rate is 1/5 = 20% per year.

2. **Declining-Balance Rate:**  
   The declining-balance method uses a rate higher than the straight-line rate. Typically, it's 150% of the straight-line rate, which is 30%. However, in this case, the rate is likely double the straight-line rate, making it 40%.

3. **First Year Depreciation:**  
   Depreciation = $3,000 × 40% = $1,200.  
   Book Value at the end of Year 1 = $3,000 - $1,200 = $1,800.

4. **Second Year Depreciation:**  
   Depreciation = $1,800 × 40% = $720.

5. **Conclusion:**  
   The depreciation for the second year is $720, which corresponds to option H.
