Okay, so I've got this problem about absorption in a column, and I'm trying to figure out the transfer rate per unit area. Let me try to work through it step by step. 

The problem says that a column is used to absorb ammonia in water from a feed of air and ammonia. The conditions are 1 atm and 0°C. The resistance to transfer is completely in the gas phase, which means it's all in the gas film. The thickness of this gas film is 1.5 mm. The partial pressure of NH3 at a certain point in the column is 55 mm Hg. The diffusivity of ammonia in air is given as 0.198 cm²/sec at 0°C.

The question is asking for the transfer rate per unit area at that point. The options are A through J, with various values in gmoles/cm²-sec.

Alright, so I think this has to do with mass transfer, probably using something like the film theory or the concept of mass transfer coefficients. Since the resistance is only in the gas phase, I can model this using the gas-phase mass transfer.

I remember that for a situation where mass transfer occurs across a gas film, the rate can be calculated using the formula:

N = (D * P) / (δ * sqrt(π))

Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Maybe I should think in terms of the mass transfer coefficient. Oh right, the film theory model might involve the Sherwood number, but since we're given the diffusivity, maybe it's simpler.

Wait, another approach: the mass transfer rate can be calculated using the formula for flux (N) which is (P * D) / (δ * sqrt(2π)), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's related to the equation for steady-state diffusion in a stagnant film.

Wait, I think the formula for the flux (N) when there's a concentration gradient in a gas film is given by:

N = (P * D) / (δ * sqrt(2πr)) 

Wait, no, maybe that's not the right approach. Alternatively, I've heard of the formula involving the Peclet number, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating it.

Wait, perhaps it's better to use the equation for mass transfer in a laminar flow through a film. The flux (N) is given by:

N = (D * P) / (δ * sqrt(2π))

But I'm not entirely sure about the exact formula. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the formula for the rate of mass transfer per unit area, which is the flux N (in mol/cm²·sec). The flux can be calculated using the formula:

N = (P * D) / (δ * sqrt(π))

Wait, where P is the partial pressure, D is the diffusion coefficient, and δ is the thickness of the film.

Wait, but I'm not certain about the exact form. Maybe I should check the units to see if that helps.

Let me list the given data:

- Partial pressure of NH3, P = 55 mm Hg. But I need to convert this into units compatible with the others. Since the diffusivity D is in cm²/sec, perhaps pressure should be in some unit that combines with D to give the correct units for flux.

Wait, the units of N should be gmoles/cm²·sec. But how does pressure, diffusivity, and film thickness relate to that?

Wait, perhaps I should convert the partial pressure from mm Hg to atmospheres or Pascals, but maybe it's easier to work in mm Hg since the film's thickness is given in mm, which I can convert to cm.

Wait, let me convert the film thickness δ from mm to cm: 1.5 mm = 0.15 cm.

Now, the units for N (flux) are gmoles/cm²·sec. So, let's see. The formula must combine P, D, and δ to get these units.

I think the formula is N = (P * D) / (δ * sqrt(π)). Let me check the units:

P is in mm Hg, which is a pressure unit. D is cm²/sec. δ is cm.

Hmm, but mm Hg is a pressure, which can be converted into kg/(m·s²) or similar, but perhaps it's easier to find a way to get the flux in correct units.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses the pressure gradient, but in this case, the flux is due to the partial pressure driving the mass transfer.

Wait, another approach: the flux N can be calculated using the equation:

N = (P * D) / (δ * sqrt(2π))

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, maybe it's N = (P * D) / (δ * sqrt(π)).

Wait, let me think about the units:

If P is in mm Hg, D is cm²/sec, δ is cm.

So, units for N would be (mm Hg * cm²/sec) / (cm * sqrt(units)).

Wait, but mm Hg is a pressure, which is force per area, so kg/(m·s²). Let me convert mm Hg to kg/(m·s²).

1 mm Hg = 133.322 Pascals (since 1 atm = 760 mm Hg = 101325 Pa, so 1 mm Hg ≈ 133.322 Pa).

So 55 mm Hg = 55 * 133.322 ≈ 7332.71 Pa.

But wait, maybe it's easier to work in mm Hg and find a way to make the units work.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is N = (P * D) / (δ * sqrt(π)).

Let me plug in the numbers:

P = 55 mm Hg.

D = 0.198 cm²/sec.

δ = 0.15 cm.

So N = (55 mm Hg * 0.198 cm²/sec) / (0.15 cm * sqrt(π)).

Wait, but what are the units here? Let's see.

Wait, mm Hg is a pressure, which is kg/(m·s²). Hmm, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses the fact that the flux is proportional to the pressure and the diffusion coefficient, inversely proportional to the film thickness.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula for the mass transfer coefficient k, which for a laminar flow in a film is given by:

k = (D / δ) * sqrt( (π * P) / (2 * ρ_air) )

Wait, but maybe that's complicating things. Alternatively, perhaps the flux is given by N = (P * D) / (δ * sqrt(2π)).

Wait, let me think about the units again. D is cm²/s, δ is cm, so D/δ is cm/s.

P is pressure, which can be expressed as (force/area) = (mass × acceleration)/area = mass/(length × time²).

So, putting it all together, (P × D) has units (mass/(length·time²)) × (length²/time) )= mass/(length·time³).

Divided by δ (length) and multiplied by 1/sqrt(2π), which is unitless, the overall units would be mass/(length²·time³).

Wait, but flux N is mass/(area × time), which is mass/(length² × time). Hmm, this doesn't seem to match. So perhaps I'm using the wrong formula.

Wait, another approach: the flux due to diffusion in a film can be expressed as N = (P * D) / (δ * sqrt(π)), but I'm not sure. Let's try plugging in the numbers and see.

N = (55 mm Hg * 0.198 cm²/s) / (0.15 cm * sqrt(π)).

Wait, but 55 mm Hg needs to be converted into a unit compatible with D and δ. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing a conversion factor here.

Wait, perhaps the formula is N = (P * D) / (δ * sqrt(π)).

But let's check the units:

P: mm Hg → let's convert to Pascals. 55 mm Hg = 7332.71 Pa = 7332.71 kg/(m·s²).

D: 0.198 cm²/s = 0.198 × (1e-2 m)^2 / s = 0.198e-4 m²/s.

δ: 0.15 cm = 0.0015 m.

So N = (7332.71 kg/(m·s²) * 0.198e-4 m²/s) / (0.0015 m * sqrt(π)).

Let's compute numerator: 7332.71 * 0.198e-4 ≈ 7332.71 * 1.98e-5 ≈ approx 0.1449 kg/(s³).

Denominator: 0.0015 * sqrt(3.1416) ≈ 0.0015 * 1.77245 ≈ 0.0026587 m.

So N ≈ (0.1449 kg/s³) / 0.0026587 m ≈ 54.5 kg/(m²·s).

Wait, but the desired unit is gmoles/cm²·sec. So I need to convert kg/(m²·s) to gmoles/cm²·s.

First, kg to grams: 1 kg = 1e3 g.

m² to cm²: 1 m² = 1e4 cm².

So 54.5 kg/(m²·s) = 54.5 * 1e3 g / (1e4 cm² · s) ) = 54.5 * 0.1 g/(cm²·s) = 5.45 g/(cm²·s).

Wait, but that's in grams per cm² per second. But the answer options are in gmoles, so I need to convert grams to gmoles.

The molar mass of NH3 is 17 g/mol (14 N + 3 H = 17).

So 5.45 g/(cm²·s) = 5.45 / 17 = approx 0.3206 gmoles/(cm²·s).

Wait, but looking at the options, they are on the order of 1e-6 gmoles/cm²·sec. So 0.32 is way too high. Hmm, that suggests I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the formula. Maybe I should have used a different approach.

Another approach: The transfer rate per unit area (N) can be calculated using the equation for steady-state diffusion in a film, which is:

N = (P * D) / (δ * sqrt(π))

But wait, perhaps the correct formula is N = (P * D) / (δ * sqrt(2π)).

Wait, let me try that.

So, using natural units, perhaps. Let me redo the calculation with proper unit conversions.

First, let's convert P from mm Hg to atmospheres, since the problem mentions 1 atm. Wait, but maybe it's more straightforward to keep it in mm Hg and find a way.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses the pressure in a specific way. Let me try to find a source or a formula.

Wait, I think the correct formula for the mass flux (N) when the transfer is in the gas phase is:

N = ( (P) * D ) / ( δ * sqrt(π) )

But let me make sure about the units.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the flux is given by N = (P * D) / (δ * sqrt(2π)).

Wait, I think I'm confusing different models here. Let me try to find the correct formula.

Wait, perhaps it's better to approach this using the concept of the mass transfer coefficient (k). The mass transfer coefficient for a laminar flow in a film can be given by:

k = (D / δ) * (P / (2 * sqrt(π * D * L)) )

Wait, maybe that's not the right formula. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the equation for the rate of mass transfer, which is:

N = k * P

Where k is the mass transfer coefficient. Then, the coefficient k can be calculated as:

k = D / δ

Wait, no, that can't be right because then the units wouldn't match. Alternatively, perhaps k is proportional to D/δ.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try a different approach.

I recall that the mass flux N (mol/cm²·sec) can be calculated using the formula:

N = (P * D) / (δ * sqrt(2π))

Where:
- P is the partial pressure in mm Hg
- D is the diffusion coefficient in cm²/sec
- δ is the film thickness in cm

Wait, but let's check the units:

P is in mm Hg, which I need to convert to cm Hg, perhaps. Or maybe I should convert mm Hg to Pascals and then to kg/(m·s²).

Alternatively, perhaps the formula assumes that P is converted into the correct units.

Wait, perhaps another way: The flux N can be calculated using the equation:

N = ( (P) * D ) / (δ * sqrt(2π)) )

Let me try plugging in the numbers with the correct unit conversions.

First, convert P from mm Hg to kg/(m·s²):

1 mm Hg = 133.322 Pa = 133.322 kg/(m·s²)

So P = 55 mm Hg = 55 * 133.322 ≈ 7332.71 kg/(m·s²)

D = 0.198 cm²/sec = 0.198 × (1e-2 m)^2 / sec = 0.198e-4 m²/s

δ = 1.5 mm = 0.15 cm = 0.0015 m

Now, plug into the formula:

N = (7332.71 kg/(m·s²) * 0.198e-4 m²/s) / (0.0015 m * sqrt(2 * π))

Compute numerator: 7332.71 * 0.198e-4 ≈ 7332.71 * 1.98e-5 ≈ 0.145 kg/(s³)

Denominator: 0.0015 m * sqrt(6.2832) ≈ 0.0015 * 2.5133 ≈ 0.00376995 m

So N ≈ 0.145 / 0.00376995 ≈ 38.47 kg/(m²·s)

Convert kg/(m²·s) to gmoles/cm²·s:

1 kg = 1e3 g, 1 m² = 1e4 cm².

So 38.47 kg/(m²·s) = 38.47 * 1e3 g / (1e4 cm²·s) ) = 38.47 * 0.1 g/(cm²·s) = 3.847 g/(cm²·s)

Now, convert grams to gmoles using molar mass of NH3 (17 g/mol):

3.847 g/(cm²·s) / 17 g/mol ≈ 0.2263 mol/(cm²·s) → 0.2263 gmoles/(cm²·s)

But this is way higher than any of the options given, which are in the 1e-6 range. So something's wrong with this approach.

Wait, perhaps the formula I'm using is incorrect. Maybe I should use the formula for the rate of mass transfer in a gas film, which is:

N = (P * D) / (δ * sqrt(π)) 

But let's try that.

N = (55 mm Hg * 0.198 cm²/s) / (0.15 cm * sqrt(π))

Wait, but I need to ensure that the units match. Let me convert P to appropriate units.

Wait, perhaps I should convert P from mm Hg to cm Hg, since D is in cm²/s and δ in cm.

1 mm Hg = 0.1 cm Hg, so 55 mm Hg = 5.5 cm Hg.

So P = 5.5 cm Hg.

Wait, but Hg (mercury) is a liquid, so pressure in cm Hg is a measure of height, which relates to pressure. The conversion from cm Hg to Pascals is needed, but perhaps another approach is better.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses the pressure in cm Hg, but I'm not sure. Let me try this approach.

So N = (5.5 cm Hg * 0.198 cm²/s) / (0.15 cm * sqrt(π)).

Wait, cm Hg is a unit of pressure, but I'm not sure how to handle the units here. Let me proceed numerically.

Numerator: 5.5 * 0.198 = 1.089.

Denominator: 0.15 * sqrt(3.1416) ≈ 0.15 * 1.772 ≈ 0.2658.

So N ≈ 1.089 / 0.2658 ≈ 4.096 cm/(s).

Wait, but the unit here would be (cm Hg * cm²/s) / (cm * unitless) → (cm Hg * cm)/s.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. I'm getting cm/s, but I need gmoles/cm²·s.

Hmm, clearly, this approach isn't working. I must be missing something in the formula.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula for the mass transfer rate when the driving force is the partial pressure difference across the gas film. The formula might be:

N = (D * P) / (δ * sqrt(2π))

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, maybe I should use the formula involving the mass transfer coefficient k, which is given by:

k = (D / δ) * (P / sqrt(2π))

Then, N = k * P

Wait, no, that might not be right. Alternatively, perhaps the flux N is given by:

N = (P * D) / (δ * sqrt(2π))

Let me try this again with unit conversions.

P = 55 mm Hg = 55 * 133.322 Pa ≈ 7332.71 Pa = 7332.71 kg/(m·s²)

D = 0.198 cm²/s = 0.198e-4 m²/s

δ = 0.15 cm = 0.0015 m

So N = (7332.71 kg/(m·s²) * 0.198e-4 m²/s) / (0.0015 m * sqrt(2π))

Calculate numerator: 7332.71 * 0.198e-4 ≈ 0.145 kg/(s³)

Denominator: 0.0015 m * 2.5066 ≈ 0.0037599 m

So N = 0.145 / 0.0037599 ≈ 38.57 kg/(m²·s)

Convert kg/(m²·s) to gmoles/cm²·s:

38.57 kg/(m²·s) = 38.57e3 g/(1e4 cm²·s) ) = 3.857 g/(cm²·s)

Molar mass of NH3 is 17 g/mol, so 3.857 / 17 ≈ 0.227 gmoles/(cm²·s), which is still way too high compared to the options.

Wait, perhaps I'm using the wrong formula. Maybe the correct formula is N = (P * D) / (δ * sqrt(π)).

Let me try that.

N = (7332.71 kg/(m·s²) * 0.198e-4 m²/s) / (0.0015 m * sqrt(π))

Numerator: same as before ≈ 0.145 kg/(s³)

Denominator: 0.0015 m * 1.77245 ≈ 0.0026587 m

N ≈ 0.145 / 0.0026587 ≈ 54.54 kg/(m²·s)

Convert to gmoles/cm²·s: 54.54 kg/(m²·s) = 54.54e3 g/(1e4 cm²·s) ) = 5.454 g/(cm²·s) → 5.454 /17 ≈ 0.321 gmoles/(cm²·s), which is still way off.

Hmm, this approach isn't working. Maybe I'm missing a factor of 1e-6 somewhere. Alternatively, perhaps the formula involves dividing by the molecular weight.

Wait, perhaps the formula for N is (P * D) / (δ * sqrt(π * M)), where M is molar mass.

Wait, let me try that. M for NH3 is 17 g/mol.

So N = (7332.71 kg/(m·s²) * 0.198e-4 m²/s) / (0.0015 m * sqrt(π * 17))

But wait, the units for M would be g/mol, but I'm not sure if that's the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the flux in terms of molar concentration.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the rate equation for adsorption, where the rate is given by:

N = (P * D) / (δ * sqrt(2π))

But perhaps I'm missing a factor of the molar mass in the conversion.

Wait, maybe I should calculate the flux in moles per cm² per second, considering the molar mass.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

N = (P * D) / (δ * sqrt(2π)) * (1/M)

Where M is the molar mass.

Let me try that.

So, N = (7332.71 kg/(m·s²) * 0.198e-4 m²/s) / (0.0015 m * sqrt(2π)) * (1/0.017 kg/mol)

Wait, wait, M is 0.017 kg/mol for NH3.

Wait, let me compute step by step.

First, compute numerator: 7332.71 * 0.198e-4 ≈ 0.145 kg/(s³)

Denominator: 0.0015 * 2.5066 ≈ 0.0037599 m

So N = (0.145 / 0.0037599) * (1/0.017)

= (38.57 kg/(m²·s)) * (1/0.017 kg/mol)

= 38.57 / 0.017 ≈ 2268.82 mol/(m²·s)

Convert to gmoles/cm²·s:

2268.82 mol/(m²·s) = 2268.82e3 gmoles/(1e4 cm²·s) ) = 226.882 gmoles/(cm²·s), which is way too high.

Hmm, I'm really stuck here. Let's think differently.

Wait, perhaps the formula is simpler. The transfer rate per unit area (flux) can be calculated using the formula:

N = (D * P) / (δ * sqrt(π * M))

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me try plugging in the numbers.

D = 0.198 cm²/s.

P = 55 mm Hg.

δ = 0.15 cm.

M = 17 g/mol.

So N = (0.198 * 55) / (0.15 * sqrt(π * 17)) 

Calculate numerator: 0.198 *55 = 10.89 cm²·mm Hg/s

Denominator: 0.15 * sqrt(π *17) ≈ 0.15 * sqrt(53.407) ≈ 0.15 * 7.308 ≈ 1.0962 cm

So N ≈ 10.89 / 1.0962 ≈ 10.0 cm·mm Hg/(cm·s)

Wait, the units here are cm·mm Hg/(cm·s) → mm Hg/s. That doesn't make sense for a flux.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider the units more carefully.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to use the formula:

N = (P * D) / (δ * sqrt(π)) 

But with P in the correct units.

Wait, perhaps P should be converted into concentration units. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for the rate of mass transfer in a film as:

N = (P * D) / (δ * sqrt(2π)) 

But again, I'm not getting the right units.

Wait, let me try another approach. The rate of mass transfer per unit area (N) can be calculated using the formula:

N = (P * D) / (δ * sqrt(2π)) 

But I need to make sure all units are compatible.

Let me convert P from mm Hg to Pascals:

P = 55 mm Hg = 55 * 133.322 ≈ 7332.71 Pa = 7332.71 kg/(m·s²)

D = 0.198 cm²/s = 0.198e-4 m²/s

δ = 0.15 cm = 0.0015 m

So N = (7332.71 kg/(m·s²) * 0.198e-4 m²/s) / (0.0015 m * sqrt(2π))

Compute numerator: 7332.71 * 0.198e-4 ≈ 0.145 kg/(s³)

Denominator: 0.0015 * 2.5066 ≈ 0.0037599 m

So N ≈ 0.145 / 0.0037599 ≈ 38.57 kg/(m²·s)

Now, convert kg/(m²·s) to gmoles/cm²·s:

38.57 kg/(m²·s) = 38.57e3 g/(1e4 cm²·s) ) = 3.857 g/(cm²·s)

Molar mass of NH3 is 17 g/mol, so 3.857 g/(cm²·s) = 3.857 / 17 ≈ 0.227 gmoles/(cm²·s)

But this is nowhere near the options given. The options are on the order of 1e-6. So I must have made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the transfer rate is per unit area, but I'm calculating it for the entire column, not per unit area. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing a factor of 1e-6 somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is N = (P * D) / (δ * sqrt(π)) ) × (1e-6) ?

But that would make the number too small. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the flux is in gmoles per cm² per second, so perhaps I need to adjust the calculation accordingly.

Wait, let me think again. Maybe the formula is:

N = (P * D) / (δ * sqrt(π)) 

But with P in mm Hg, D in cm²/s, and δ in cm.

So plugging in the numbers:

N = (55 * 0.198) / (0.15 * sqrt(π)) 

Compute numerator: 55 * 0.198 = 10.89

Denominator: 0.15 * 1.77245 ≈ 0.265868

N ≈ 10.89 / 0.265868 ≈ 40.96 cm/s

Wait, cm/s is not the correct unit for flux. Flux should be in gmoles/cm²·s, so perhaps I'm still not on the right track.

Wait, perhaps the formula involves the molar concentration. Maybe I should use the ideal gas law to find the concentration.

The partial pressure P of NH3 is 55 mm Hg. Using the ideal gas law at 0°C (273 K) and 1 atm (101325 Pa), the concentration can be found.

But I'm not sure how to proceed from here. Maybe the formula is:

N = (P * D) / (δ * sqrt(π)) 

But I'm not getting the correct units. Alternatively, perhaps I should look for the formula for the mass transfer coefficient.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

N = (P * D) / (δ * sqrt(2π)) 

But with the correct unit conversion, perhaps the result comes out to 1e-6 range.

Wait, let me try once more with the numbers and see where I'm getting stuck.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula:

N = (P * D) / (δ * sqrt(π)) 

But I'm not converting units correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps I should convert everything into CGS units.

P = 55 mm Hg → 55 mm Hg = 55 mm of Hg. Since 1 mm Hg = 133.322 Pa, which is 1333.22 dyne/cm².

Wait, 1 Pa = 1 N/m² = 10 dyn/cm². So 133.322 Pa = 1333.22 dyne/cm².

So P = 55 * 1333.22 ≈ 73,327 dyne/cm².

D = 0.198 cm²/s.

δ = 0.15 cm.

Now, plug into the formula N = (P * D) / (δ * sqrt(π))

N = (73327 dyne/cm² * 0.198 cm²/s) / (0.15 cm * sqrt(π))

Compute numerator: 73327 * 0.198 ≈ 14,520 dyne·cm²/(cm²·s) → 14,520 dyne/s

Wait, dyne is g·cm/s², so 14,520 dyne/s = 14,520 g·cm/s³.

Denominator: 0.15 cm * 1.77245 ≈ 0.265868 cm

So N ≈ (14,520 g·cm/s³) / 0.265868 cm ≈ 54,580 g/(s·cm²)

Convert to gmoles/cm²·s: 54,580 g/(cm²·s) → 54,580 / 17 ≈ 3,210.59 gmoles/(cm²·s)

But that's way too high, so I must be making a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps I'm using the wrong formula altogether. Maybe the correct formula for the mass transfer rate per unit area is:

N = (P * D) / (δ * sqrt(2π)) 

But even then, with the numbers plugged in, it's not giving the right magnitude.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the flux is given by:

N = (P * D) / (δ * sqrt(π)) 

But perhaps I should also account for the fact that P is in mm Hg, so I need to convert it to concentration units using the ideal gas law.

At 0°C, the pressure is 1 atm, so the concentration of NH3 can be found using PV = nRT.

But I'm not sure how to apply that here. Let me see:

The partial pressure P = 55 mm Hg. The total pressure is 1 atm, so the mole fraction y = 55/760 ≈ 0.07237.

The concentration of NH3 in air at 0°C and 1 atm can be calculated using the ideal gas law:

n/V = P/(RT)

Where R is the gas constant, 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K).

But perhaps it's better to compute in cm³.

Wait, let's compute the concentration in mol/cm³.

At 0°C, T = 273 K.

So, n/V = P/(RT) = (55/760 atm) / (0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K) * 273 K)

Compute denominator: 0.0821 * 273 ≈ 22.415 L/mol

n/V = (55/760) / 22.415 ≈ (0.07237) / 22.415 ≈ 3.228e-3 mol/L → 3.228e-6 mol/cm³ (since 1 L = 1000 cm³)

So concentration c = 3.228e-6 mol/cm³.

Now, the flux N can be calculated using the formula:

N = c * D

But wait, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the flux is given by N = c * D * something.

Wait, perhaps the flux is N = (c * D) / δ.

But let's try that.

N = (3.228e-6 mol/cm³ * 0.198 cm²/s) / 0.15 cm

= (3.228e-6 * 0.198) / 0.15 → (6.40164e-7) / 0.15 ≈ 4.27e-6 mol/(cm²·s)

Convert mol to gmoles: 4.27e-6 mol = 4.27e-6 gmoles, since 1 mol = 1 gmoles.

So N ≈ 4.27e-6 gmoles/(cm²·s)

Looking at the options, option J is 5.0e-6, I is 4.4e-6, and option F is 3.9e-6. So 4.27e-6 would be closest to option I (4.4e-6) or perhaps option J.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation.

n/V = (55/760) / (0.0821 * 273) → 55/760 ≈ 0.07237.

0.07237 / (0.0821 * 273) → 0.07237 / 22.415 ≈ 3.228e-3 mol/L → 3.228e-6 mol/cm³.

N = (3.228e-6 mol/cm³ * 0.198 cm²/s) / 0.15 cm

= (3.228e-6 * 0.198) / 0.15

3.228e-6 * 0.198 ≈ 6.4016e-7

Divide by 0.15: 6.4016e-7 / 0.15 ≈ 4.2677e-6 mol/(cm²·s)

Which is approximately 4.27e-6 gmoles/(cm²·s), as 1 mol = 1 gmoles.

So the closest option is I: 4.4 × 10^-6 gmoles/cm²-sec.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a rounding error. Let me check the calculation again.

n/V = (55/760) / (0.0821 * 273) → 55/760 = 0.072368.

0.072368 / (0.0821 * 273) = 0.072368 / 22.415 ≈ 3.228e-3 mol/L → 3.228e-6 mol/cm³.

N = (3.228e-6 mol/cm³ * 0.198 cm²/s) / 0.15 cm → (3.228e-6 * 0.198) / 0.15.

3.228e-6 * 0.198 = 6.40164e-7.

6.40164e-7 / 0.15 ≈ 4.2677e-6 mol/(cm²·s).

So 4.27e-6 gmoles/(cm²·s), which is very close to option I (4.4e-6) or option F (3.9e-6). But perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula to use is N = (P * D) / (δ * sqrt(π)) in appropriate units, but considering the concentration approach seems to have brought me closer to the answer.

Wait, in the concentration approach, I got N ≈4.27e-6 gmoles/(cm²·s), which is close to option I (4.4e-6) or option J (5.0e-6).

But looking back, the correct calculation using the concentration method gave me approximately 4.27e-6, which is very close to option I: 4.4e-6.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option I: 4.4 × 10^-6 gmoles/cm²-sec.

To determine the transfer rate per unit area in the column, we analyze the mass transfer process in the gas phase. The problem specifies that the resistance to transfer is entirely in the gas phase, and the relevant parameters include the partial pressure of NH₃, the diffusion coefficient, and the thickness of the gas film. The goal is to calculate the flux \( N \), which represents the transfer rate per unit area.

### Key Parameters:
- **Partial pressure of NH₃**: \( P = 55 \, \text{mm Hg} \)
- **Diffusion coefficient of NH₃ in air**: \( D = 0.198 \, \text{cm}^2/\text{sec} \)
- **Gas film thickness**: \( \delta = 1.5 \, \text{mm} = 0.15 \, \text{cm} \)
- **Molar mass of NH₃**: \( M = 17 \, \text{g/mol} \)

### Approach:
The flux \( N \) can be calculated using the formula for steady-state diffusion in a gas film:
\[
N = \frac{P \cdot D}{\delta \cdot \sqrt{\pi}}
\]
Here, \( P \) is converted to a compatible unit with \( D \) and \( \delta \). However, the units must be carefully managed to ensure consistency. Additionally, the flux is expressed in terms of gmoles per unit area per second, requiring conversion from mass to gmoles.

### Calculation:
1. **Convert \( P \) to concentration using the ideal gas law**:
   Using \( P = 55 \, \text{mm Hg} \), the concentration \( c \) is calculated as:
   \[
   c = \frac{P}{R \cdot T}
   \]
   where \( R = 0.0821 \, \text{L·atm/(mol·K)} \) and \( T = 273 \, \text{K} \). This yields:
   \[
   c \approx 3.228 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{mol/cm}^3
   \]

2. **Calculate the flux \( N \)**:
   Using the formula \( N = \frac{c \cdot D}{\delta} \), we substitute the values:
   \[
   N = \frac{(3.228 \times 10^{-6}) \cdot 0.198}{0.15} \approx 4.27 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{gmoles/cm}^2\text{-sec}
   \]

### Final Answer:
The calculated flux \( N \) is approximately \( 4.27 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{gmoles/cm}^2\text{-sec} \), which aligns closely with option **I: \( 4.4 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{gmoles/cm}^2\text{-sec} \)**.
