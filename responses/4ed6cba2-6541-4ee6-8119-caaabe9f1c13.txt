Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here about blood types and allele frequencies. Let's try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of this, but I'll do my best.

The question gives me a table with the blood types of the population in a small village. The blood types are M, N, and MN. The numbers are: M is 53, N is 4, MN is 29, and the total is 86. I need to find the frequencies of the L^M and L^N alleles.

Wait, wait, the alleles are L^M and L^N? Hmm, I think I remember that in blood types, the ABO system uses A, B, and O alleles. But maybe this is a different system, perhaps the MN blood group? I think the MN system is another blood group, like the MNS system, which involves M, N, and Ss. But in this case, the question is about M and N, so the alleles are L^M and L^N. So, each person has two alleles, either same or different.

So, first, I need to calculate the genotype frequencies. The given data is the phenotype counts: number of M, N, and MN individuals. To find allele frequencies, I can use these numbers.

Let me write down the numbers:

- M phenotype: 53
- N phenotype: 4
- MN phenotype: 29
- Total: 86

Wait, but in the MN blood group, the M phenotype is determined by having at least one M allele (either MM or MN), and N is determined by having at least one N allele (NN or MN). But wait, that's confusing because MN would have both M and N alleles. So, for the MN blood group, the phenotypes are M (homozygous MM or heterozygous MN), N (homozygous NN or heterozygous MN), but wait, that can't be right because if someone is MN, they'd express both M and N, but I'm not sure how that translates to the phenotype. Alternatively, maybe the MN phenotype is a separate category. Oh, right, in some systems, the MN phenotype is a distinct type, showing both M and N antigens. So perhaps in this case, the M phenotype is MM, N is NN, and MN is the heterozygote.

Wait, no, that might not be correct. Let me think. In the MN blood group, the possible genotypes are MM, MN, and NN. The corresponding phenotypes are M, MN, and N. So the M phenotype is MM, N is NN, and MN is the heterozygote. So the counts given are for each phenotype: M (53), N (4), and MN (29). So the total is 53+4+29 = 86.

Wait, that adds up correctly. So 53 M, 4 N, 29 MN, total of 86 individuals.

Each individual has two alleles. So to find the allele frequencies, I can calculate the total number of each allele in the population.

Let's break it down:

- For the M phenotype (MM): each individual has two M alleles. So 53 individuals contribute 2 M alleles each. So total M alleles from M phenotype: 53 * 2 = 106.
- For the N phenotype (NN): each has two N alleles. So 4 * 2 = 8 N alleles.
- For the MN phenotype (heterozygotes): each has one M and one N allele. So 29 individuals contribute 29 M and 29 N alleles.

So total M alleles: 106 (from MM) + 29 (from MN) = 135.
Total N alleles: 8 (from NN) + 29 (from MN) = 37.

But wait, each individual contributes two alleles, so the total number of alleles in the population is 86 * 2 = 172.

So the frequency of L^M is total M alleles divided by 172, and L^N is total N alleles divided by 172.

Calculating:

L^M frequency = 135 / 172 ≈ 0.7843 (approximately 0.784)
L^N frequency = 37 / 172 ≈ 0.2151 (approximately 0.215)

Looking at the options, let's see which one matches these numbers.

Option I: L^M = .785, L^N = .215. That's very close to what I calculated. So the answer should be option I.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Total M alleles: 53 * 2 = 106 (from MM) + 29 (from MN) = 135.
Total N alleles: 4 * 2 =8 (from NN) + 29 (from MN) =37.
Total alleles = 172.

135/172 ≈ 0.7843 → 0.785 when rounded to three decimal places.
37/172 ≈ 0.2151 → 0.215.

Yes, that matches option I: L^M = .785, L^N = .215.

The problem involves determining the allele frequencies of L^M and L^N in a population based on blood type data. The given counts are: M = 53, N = 4, MN = 29, with a total of 86 individuals. Each individual has two alleles, so the total number of alleles is 86 × 2 = 172.

To calculate the allele frequencies:

1. **Total M alleles**:  
   - M phenotype (MM): 53 individuals × 2 M alleles = 106 M alleles.  
   - MN phenotype: 29 individuals × 1 M allele = 29 M alleles.  
   - Total M alleles = 106 + 29 = 135.

2. **Total N alleles**:  
   - N phenotype (NN): 4 individuals × 2 N alleles = 8 N alleles.  
   - MN phenotype: 29 individuals × 1 N allele = 29 N alleles.  
   - Total N alleles = 8 + 29 = 37.

3. **Allele frequencies**:  
   - Frequency of L^M = 135 / 172 ≈ 0.785.  
   - Frequency of L^N = 37 / 172 ≈ 0.215.

Comparing these values to the options, the correct choice is **I: frequency L^M = 0.785, frequency L^N = 0.215**.
