Question:

A typical bacterial cell has a cell wall and plasma membrane. If the cell wall is removed by treatment withlysozyme, an enzyme that selectively dissolves the cell wall material, will the bacteria live? Explain. What is the biochemicaldifference between the cell walls of bacteria, and plants?

Options:

A: The bacterial cell can live without its cell wall in an isotonic medium, where the osmotic pressure is equal to the bacterial protoplasm. The cell wall of bacteria is composed of insoluble peptidoglycan, while the cell wall in eucaryotes is composed of cellulose.
B: The bacterial cell will immediately die without its cell wall, as the plasma membrane alone cannot withstand osmotic pressure. The cell wall of bacteria is similar to that of plants, both composed of cellulose.
C: The bacterial cell can live without its cell wall as long as it is provided with an external structural support. The cell wall of bacteria is composed of a complex mixture of proteins and carbohydrates, distinct from the cellulose-based cell walls of plants.
D: The cell wall in eucaryotes is composed of peptidoglycan.
E: The bacterial cell can only live without its cell wall in a hypertonic medium, where the osmotic pressure is higher outside than inside the bacterial protoplasm. The cell wall of bacteria is composed of chitin, while the cell wall in eucaryotes is composed of cellulose.
F: The bacterial cell can survive without its cell wall in a hypotonic medium, where the osmotic pressure is lower outside than inside the bacterial protoplasm. The cell wall of bacteria is made of glycoproteins, in contrast to the cellulose in plant cell walls.
G: The bacterial cell cannot survive without its cell wall in any circumstances.
H: The cell wall of bacteria is composed of lipids.
I: The bacterial cell wall can regenerate quickly after removal, allowing the bacteria to survive without it temporarily. The biochemical difference is that bacterial cell walls have a higher lipid content compared to the cellulose-rich cell walls of plants.
J: The bacterial cell cannot live without its cell wall because it provides essential nutrients. The cell walls of bacteria are made primarily of lignin, whereas plant cell walls are composed of cellulose and lignin.

Okay, so I've got this biology question here about bacterial cells and their cell walls. Let me read through it carefully and try to figure it out step by step. 

The question says that a typical bacterial cell has a cell wall and a plasma membrane. If the cell wall is removed using lysozyme, which breaks down the cell wall material, will the bacteria live? And then there's a second part asking about the biochemical difference between bacterial and plant cell walls.

Alright, I remember from my notes that the cell wall in bacteria is made of peptidoglycan. I think peptidoglycan is a polymer of sugars and amino acids. Lysozyme specifically targets this peptidoglycan structure, breaking it down. So when you treat the bacteria with lysozyme, the cell wall would be removed. But does the cell survive?

I recall that in bacteria, the cell wall plays a crucial role in maintaining the cell's shape and withstanding the internal osmotic pressure. Without the cell wall, the plasma membrane might not be enough to hold the cell's shape, especially if the environment is isotonic or hypotonic. Wait, in an isotonic solution, the osmotic pressure inside and outside is equal, so the cell doesn't normally expand or contract. But without the cell wall, would the cell burst? Or would it just lose its shape but stay intact?

I think that without the cell wall, the bacterial cell might become spherical because the cell wall helps maintain the rigid structure. But whether the cell lives or dies depends on whether the plasma membrane can handle the pressure. I remember reading that some bacteria can survive without their cell wall in certain conditions. Like, if the environment is such that the osmotic pressure is balanced, maybe they can live. Or perhaps they require some external support, like being in a solution that prevents the cell from bursting.

Wait, another thought: the cell wall also protects the cell from lysis. So without it, the cell might lyse if the osmotic pressure is too high on one side. So if the medium is hypotonic (lower osmotic pressure outside), water would rush into the cell, and without the cell wall, the membrane might not hold, causing the cell to burst. But in an isotonic medium, the pressure is balanced, so maybe the cell can survive because the membrane can handle it without the wall.

So for the first part: will the bacteria live after losing the cell wall? It depends on the medium. If it's isotonic, perhaps it can live because the osmotic pressure is equal, so no net movement of water. But if it's hypotonic, the cell might take in water and burst. So the answer might depend on the condition.

Wait, looking at the options, let's see. Option A says the bacterial cell can live without its wall in an isotonic medium. That makes sense because in isotonic conditions, the osmotic pressure inside and outside is the same, so the cell won't take in water. But if the cell wall is removed, the cell might lose its shape but not necessarily die if the osmotic pressure is balanced. So the cell can live, but it might not have its shape anymore.

Now the second part: the biochemical difference between bacterial and plant cell walls. I know that bacterial cell walls have peptidoglycan, which is a unique structure. Plant cell walls, on the other hand, are made of cellulose. Cellulose is a polysaccharide, a type of carbohydrate. So the main component of plant cell walls is cellulose, while bacterial cell walls are made of peptidoglycan.

Looking at the options, option A correctly states that bacterial cell walls are made of insoluble peptidoglycan, and plant cell walls are made of cellulose. That seems right. Let me check the other options to make sure.

Option B says the cell wall is similar to plants, both made of cellulose. No, that's incorrect because bacterial cell walls are peptidoglycan, not cellulose.

Option C says the bacterial cell can live as long as it has external support, which might be true in some cases, but the biochemical part says it's a mixture of proteins and carbs, distinct from plant's cellulose. Wait, peptidoglycan is a mix of sugars and amino acids (proteins), so that's correct. So this option is also a possibility.

Wait, but the first part of option A says the cell can live in isotonic medium, which I think is correct. The second part of option C says the wall is made of proteins and carbs, which is correct, and plant's is cellulose. So both A and C have correct biochemical differences.

Wait, but the question is a single correct answer. Let me read the options again.

Option A: The bacterial cell can live without its cell wall in an isotonic medium. The cell wall is peptidoglycan, plant's is cellulose.

Option C: Can live as long as provided with external support. Wall is proteins and carbs; plant's is cellulose.

Which one is correct? The first part of the question is about whether the cell can live after losing the wall. I think that if the cell is placed in an isotonic solution, the cell won't take in water because the osmotic pressure is the same. So the cell won't burst, but without the cell wall, it might not maintain its shape but might survive. So the cell can live in isotonic conditions without the wall. So option A's first part is correct.

Option C's first part says it can live as long as it's given external support, which might be another scenario. But the question doesn't specify the medium, just asks if the bacteria can live. So the correct condition for survival would be isotonic, making option A correct.

Also, looking at other options: Option D says the eukaryotic cell wall is peptidoglycan, which is wrong because eukaryotes (like plants) have cellulose. Option E says bacterial wall is chitin, which is incorrect. Chitin is in fungi and some arthropods. Option F says wall is glycoproteins vs plant's cellulose. No, bacterial walls are peptidoglycan, which includes both polysaccharides and proteins, but not exactly glycoproteins. Option G says it can't survive under any circumstances, which is incorrect because they can survive in isotonic solutions.

So the correct answer is option A.

The bacterial cell can live without its cell wall in an isotonic medium because the osmotic pressure inside and outside the cell is equal, preventing water from rushing in and causing the cell to burst. The cell wall of bacteria is composed of peptidoglycan, a unique structure made of sugars and amino acids, while the cell walls of plants are composed of cellulose, a polysaccharide.
