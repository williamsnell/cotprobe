Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again: an object carries a charge of –1 C. How many excess electrons does it contain? The options are from A to J, with various numbers given.

Hmm, I remember from my classes that the charge of an electron is negative. Oh right, the elementary charge, which is the charge of a single proton or electron, is approximately 1.602 × 10^-19 coulombs. Since the object has a negative charge, it must have gained electrons because electrons have a negative charge.

So the problem is asking for the number of excess electrons. Each electron contributes a charge of -1.602e-19 C. If the total charge is -1 C, I think I can find the number of electrons by dividing the total charge by the charge per electron.

Wait, let me make sure. The formula should be number of electrons = total charge / charge per electron. But since the charge is negative, that just tells me it's electrons, not protons. So plugging in the numbers:

Total charge Q = -1 C
Charge per electron e = -1.602 × 10^-19 C

So the number of electrons n would be Q divided by e. But since both are negative, the negatives cancel out, giving a positive number.

n = (-1 C) / (-1.602e-19 C) ≈ (1) / (1.602e-19) ≈ 6.247 × 10^18 electrons.

Let me double-check that calculation. 1 divided by 1.602e-19 is the same as 1 / 1.602 × 10^19, which is approximately 0.6247 × 10^19, or 6.247 × 10^18. That makes sense.

Looking at the options, option D is 6.25 × 10^18, which is very close to what I got. So I think that's the correct answer.

Wait, but did I do that right? Let me think again. Each electron is -1.6e-19 C, so how many make up 1 C? So 1 C divided by 1.6e-19 C/electron gives about 6.25e18 electrons. Yep, that's right. So the correct choice is D.

The object has a charge of -1 C, which means it has gained electrons. Each electron has a charge of -1.602 × 10^-19 C. To find the number of electrons, divide the total charge by the charge per electron: \( \frac{1}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 6.25 \times 10^{18} \). 

Answer: D
