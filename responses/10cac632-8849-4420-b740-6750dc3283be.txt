Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and displacement fields. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll give it a shot.

The question is about a positive point charge of 5 × 10^-10 coulombs. We need to find the magnitude of E (electric field) and D (displacement field) at a distance of 30 cm. There are two scenarios: (a) when the charge is in air, and (b) when it's in glycerin with a relative permittivity (epsilon_r) of 50.

First, I remember that the electric field E due to a point charge is given by Coulomb's law: E = k * |q| / r². Here, k is Coulomb's constant, approximately 8.988 × 10^9 N·m²/C². The distance r is 30 cm, which is 0.3 meters.

So, plugging in the numbers: E = (8.988e9) * (5e-10) / (0.3)^2.

Let me calculate that. 5e-10 is 5 × 10^-10. Multiply by 8.988e9 gives (8.988 *5) × 10^-1, which is about 44.94 × 10^-1, so 4.494. Then divide by 0.09 (since 0.3^2 is 0.09). So 4.494 / 0.09 is approximately 49.933... So around 50 volts/meter. That's the electric field in air.

Now, for the displacement field D. I think D is related to E by D = ε₀ E, where ε₀ is the vacuum permittivity. But wait, no, more accurately, D is the electric displacement field, and in a medium, E = D / ε₀? No, wait, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, the relation is D = ε₀ E + P, where P is the polarization. But for a linear isotropic material, D = ε₀ ε_r E, where ε_r is the relative permittivity. Or wait, no—actually, E = D / (ε₀ ε_r), because D = ε₀ ε E, where ε is the absolute permittivity, which is ε = ε₀ ε_r.

Wait, let me get this right. The electric displacement D is defined as D = ε₀ E + P. For linear isotropic materials, P = χe ε₀ E, and χe = ε_r - 1. So D = ε₀ E (1 + χe) ) = ε₀ ε_r E. So D = ε₀ ε_r E, and E = D / (ε₀ ε_r).

Wait, but in the case of vacuum (air is approximately vacuum for this purpose), ε_r is 1. So D = ε₀ E. So in air, D = ε₀ * E.

So let's compute D in air. E is about 50 V/m, so D = (8.854e-12 F/m) * 50 V/m. 8.854e-12 *50 = 4.427e-10 C/m². Hmm, looking at the options, option E for air has E=50, D=4.44e-10, which matches closely.

Now, for the glycerin part. The relative permittivity ε_r is 50. So, how does this affect E and D?

In a medium, the electric field E is the same as in vacuum only if the medium doesn't affect the charges. Wait, no, the presence of the medium affects the field. Wait, actually, when you have a medium, the displacement field D remains the same as in vacuum because D depends only on the free charges, not the bound charges. So D is the same as in vacuum, but E is D divided by ε (the absolute permittivity). So E = D / (ε₀ ε_r).

Wait, let me think again. The point charge is in glycerin, so the medium is glycerin. The displacement field D is given by D = (1/(4π ε)) * q / r², but wait, no, D is similar to E but using ε₀ instead. Alternatively, D = (ε₀ ε_r) * E_medium.

Wait, perhaps another approach. The displacement field D is equal to the same as in vacuum because D only depends on the free charge, and in this case, the charge is the same. So D remains the same as in air, but E changes because E = D / (ε₀ ε_r).

Wait, that makes sense. So in both cases, D is the same as in air because the free charge is the same. But E is different because the medium affects it.

So in glycerin, D is the same as in air, which is about 4.427e-10 C/m². Then E = D / (ε₀ ε_r).

So E_glycerin = (4.427e-10) / (8.854e-12 * 50).

Let me compute that denominator: 8.854e-12 *50 = 4.427e-10. So E = 4.427e-10 / 4.427e-10 = 1 V/m? Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, because I think I might have made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, actually, in the medium, E = D / (ε₀ ε_r). So plugging in D from air: D = ε₀ E_air. So in glycerin, E_glycerin = D / (ε₀ ε_r) = (ε₀ E_air) / (ε₀ ε_r) )= E_air / ε_r.

So E_glycerin = (50 V/m) / 50 = 1 V/m.

Wait, that makes sense because the E would decrease by a factor of ε_r.

So in glycerin, E is 1 V/m, and D is the same as in air, approximately 4.427e-10 C/m², which rounds to 4.44e-10 as in option E.

Looking at the options, option E says: E=50 V/m and D=4.44e-10 in air; E=1 V/m and D=4.42e-10 in glycerin. That matches.

Wait, but let me check the options again. Option E states: E=50 in air, E=1 in glycerin, D=4.44e-10 in air, D=4.42e-10 in glycerin. That seems correct.

So the correct answer should be option E.

The electric field \( E \) due to a point charge is calculated using Coulomb's law:  
\[
E = \frac{k |q|}{r^2}
\]  
where \( k = 8.988 \times 10^9 \, \text{N·m}^2/\text{C}^2 \), \( q = 5 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{C} \), and \( r = 0.3 \, \text{m} \). Substituting these values gives \( E \approx 50 \, \text{V/m} \) in air.  

The displacement field \( D \) is related to \( E \) by \( D = \varepsilon_0 E \), where \( \varepsilon_0 = 8.854 \times 10^{-12} \, \text{F/m} \). Substituting \( E \) gives \( D \approx 4.44 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{C/m}^2 \) in air.  

In glycerin (\( \varepsilon_r = 50 \)), \( D \) remains the same as in air because it depends only on the free charge. The electric field \( E \) is reduced by a factor of \( \varepsilon_r \), giving \( E \approx 1 \, \text{V/m} \) in glycerin.  

Thus, the correct answer is:  
**E: \( E = 50 \, \text{V/m} \) and \( D = 4.44 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{C/m}^2 \) in air, \( E = 1 \, \text{V/m} \) and \( D = 4.42 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{C/m}^2 \) in glycerin.**
