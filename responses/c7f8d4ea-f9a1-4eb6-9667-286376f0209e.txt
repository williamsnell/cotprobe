D: {NOT, OR}
E: {XOR, NOT}
F: {AND, NOT}
G: {OR, NOR}
H: {NOR}

Okay, so I have this question about Boolean algebra and completeness of operator sets. The question is asking which of the given options is NOT complete. A complete set of Boolean operators means that any Boolean expression can be represented using just those operators. If a set isn't complete, then there are some expressions that can't be made with those operators alone.

Let me go through each option one by one and see which one can't express all possible Boolean expressions.

Option A: {NAND}. I remember that NAND is a universal gate. That means you can build any other gate using just NAND. For example, you can make NOT, AND, OR, etc., using NAND. So {NAND} is complete.

Option B: {NOT, NAND}. Since NAND is universal and we already have NOT, this set is definitely complete. Because even if you didn't have NOT, NAND alone is enough. Adding NOT doesn't make it incomplete, so this is complete.

Option C: {AND, OR}. Hmm, I'm not sure about this one. AND and OR are basic gates, but can they express everything? Wait, without any negation operator like NOT, can you represent all expressions? I think you can't. For example, can you create a NOT function with just AND and OR? I don't think so. Because to get NOT A, you'd need something like A AND (NOT something), but without a way to invert, you can't get the negation. So {AND, OR} alone might not be complete. This could be the answer.

Option D: {NOT, OR}. Let's see. OR and NOT. Can these two express everything? I think OR combined with NOT can, because you can make AND using De Morgan's laws. For example, NOT (NOT A OR NOT B) is equivalent to A AND B. So with NOT and OR, you can express AND, which along with OR and NOT, allows you to build any expression. So this set is complete.

Option E: {XOR, NOT}. XOR is interesting. I recall that XOR combined with NOT is also universal. Because you can make other gates with them. For example, you can create AND using XOR and NOT. So this set should be complete.

Option F: {AND, NOT}. AND and NOT. I think this is complete because you can make OR using De Morgan's laws. OR is equivalent to NOT (NOT A AND NOT B). So with AND and NOT, you can create OR. Therefore, this set is complete.

Option G: {OR, NOR}. OR and NOR. NOR is the negation of OR, right? So similar to NAND, I think NOR is also a universal gate. So {OR, NOR} would be complete because you can express all necessary operations. Wait, but do you really need both OR and NOR? Let me think. Without NOT, can you get it? Well, since OR is there, and NOR is NOT OR. So for example, with OR and NOR, you can get NOT: NOT A is equivalent to A NOR A. Because A OR A is A, so NOT (A OR A) is NOT A. So with OR and NOR, you have NOT, and then you can build the rest. So this set is complete.

Option H: {NOR}. Similar to option A, since NOR is a universal gate, the set {NOR} alone is complete. So this is complete.

Wait, so going back. The question is which is NOT complete. So from the above analysis, option C: {AND, OR} is the one that's NOT complete because you can't express NOT with just AND and OR. So the answer should be option C.

The question asks which set of Boolean operators is NOT complete. A complete set can represent all Boolean expressions. Let's analyze each option:

- **A: {NAND}**  
  NAND is a universal gate, meaning any Boolean expression can be constructed using only NAND. Hence, this set is complete.

- **B: {NOT, NAND}**  
  Since NAND alone is universal, adding NOT doesn't affect completeness. This set is complete.

- **C: {AND, OR}**  
  AND and OR are basic gates, but without a negation operator like NOT, you can't express all Boolean expressions. For example, you can't create NOT A using only AND and OR. Thus, this set is NOT complete.

- **D: {NOT, OR}**  
  With NOT and OR, you can express AND using De Morgan's laws. This set is complete.

- **E: {XOR, NOT}**  
  XOR combined with NOT is universal. This set is complete.

- **F: {AND, NOT}**  
  With AND and NOT, you can express OR using De Morgan's laws. This set is complete.

- **G: {OR, NOR}**  
  NOR is the negation of OR, and together with OR, you can express NOT and other gates. This set is complete.

- **H: {NOR}**  
  NOR is a universal gate, so this set is complete.

The only set that cannot express all Boolean expressions is **C: {AND, OR}**.
