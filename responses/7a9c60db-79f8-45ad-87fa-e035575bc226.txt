Okay, so I've got this question about capacitors with different dielectrics. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The problem has three parts: a, b, and c. Each part describes a different configuration of dielectrics between the capacitor plates. I need to find the capacitance for each case and then match them with the given options.

First, let me jot down the given data. The area of each capacitor plate is 240π cm², and the separation between the plates is 10 mm. Oh wait, I should convert those into standard units. So, area A is 240π cm²—since 1 cm² is 1e-4 m², that becomes 240π * 1e-4 m². Let me calculate that: 240π is approximately 753.982, so times 1e-4 is 0.0753982 m². The separation, d, is 10 mm, which is 0.01 meters.

The formula for capacitance without dielectrics is C = ε₀ * A / d. But with dielectrics, it's C = (ε₀ * A / d) * ε_r, where ε_r is the relative permittivity (dielectric constant) of the material.

But wait, in each case, the dielectric isn't a single material. So I need to think about how multiple dielectrics affect the capacitance.

Starting with part a: two dielectrics, ε1 = 3.5 and ε2 = 8.5. It says each dielectric has the same thickness, and the interfaces are parallel to the plates. So the total separation is 10 mm, and each dielectric layer has thickness d1 and d2, with d1 + d2 = 10 mm. But wait, the problem doesn't specify the thicknesses of each dielectric. Hmm, this is a bit ambiguous. Usually, when multiple dielectrics are present with the same thickness, I think it's implied each layer has equal thickness. So if there are two dielectrics, each would occupy 5 mm. But wait, the question says "several sheets of different dielectric, each of the same thickness." So for two dielectrics, each would have 5 mm thickness. So the arrangement is like two layers, each 5 mm thick, with ε1 and ε2.

But wait, another possibility: maybe each dielectric is placed such that the effective series or parallel combination applies. Wait, no—capacitors in series when dielectrics are in series, right? Because the electric field across each dielectric would contribute to the total. So the overall capacitance would be the sum of each individual capacitance in series.

Wait, but actually, in this case, each dielectric is filling part of the same space between the plates. So the effective dielectric isn't just the average, but since the E field is the same across each, the capacitance would be the reciprocal of the sum of the reciprocals of each part. So it's like a series combination. Alternatively, if the dielectrics are in parallel, but I don't think that's the case here because each dielectric is a layer between the plates, so they're in series.

Wait, let me clarify. When the dielectrics are placed in layers between the plates, each layer effectively has the same voltage across it because the electric field is uniform, but the fields in each dielectric would be the same as the overall field. Hmm, no, wait. No, the fields in each dielectric would be the same as the total field. Because the E field is determined by the voltage across the entire separation. So the E field in each dielectric would be E = V/d_total. But for each dielectric, the voltage across it would be E * d_i, where d_i is the thickness of that dielectric.

So the capacitance of each dielectric layer would be C_i = (ε₀ * A * ε_r_i) / d_i. Since each layer is in series, the total capacitance would be the reciprocal of the sum of reciprocals. Wait, no, that's when capacitors are in series. But in this case, the two dielectrics are in parallel? Or in series? Wait, no. The arrangement is that each dielectric fills part of the space between the plates. So the two layers are in series because the total separation is the sum of each layer's thickness. So the effective capacitance would be the reciprocal of the sum of the reciprocals of each individual capacitance.

Wait, let me think again. Each dielectric is a separate layer, so the electric field across each is the same as the overall E. So each layer's voltage is E * d_i, but the total voltage is E*(d1 + d2) = E*d_total. So the total capacitance is C_total = Q_total / V_total. But each dielectric holds a charge Q_i = C_i * V_i, where V_i = E*d_i. So the total charge Q = Q1 + Q2 = (C1 V1) + (C2 V2). But since V1 = E d1 and V2 = E d2, and E = V_total / d_total.

Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Alternatively, maybe it's better to model each dielectric as a separate capacitor in series. Because the same charge flows through each, but the voltage across each is different. So the total voltage is the sum of voltages across each dielectric.

So for case a), each dielectric is 5 mm thick. So the capacitance for each would be C1 = (ε₀ A ε1) / d1 and C2 = (ε₀ A ε2) / d2. Since d1 = d2 = 5 mm = 0.005 m, each C would be (ε₀ * 240πe-4 m² * ε_r) / 0.005 m.

Wait, but wait: actually, each dielectric fills half the space, so each has a thickness of 5 mm, but each is in series. So the total capacitance would be C = (C1 * C2) / (C1 + C2). Because when capacitors are in series, the reciprocal of the total is the sum of reciprocals.

Wait, let me compute each C1 and C2.

First, compute C1: ε_r1 =3.5, d1=5 mm=0.005 m.

C1 = ε₀ * A * ε_r1 / d1.

Similarly, C2 = ε₀ * A * ε_r2 / d2.

But since d1=d2=0.005 m, and A is same, we can write C1 = (ε₀ A / 0.005) * 3.5, and C2 = (ε₀ A /0.005) *8.5.

Let me compute (ε₀ A / d) first. ε₀ is 8.85e-12 F/m.

A=240π cm² = 240π *1e-4 m² ≈ 753.982 *1e-4 = 0.0753982 m².

So ε₀ A / d = (8.85e-12 F/m) * 0.0753982 m² / 0.01 m.

Wait, wait, wait. Wait, the d is 10 mm, which is 0.01 m. So for each dielectric, the thickness is 5 mm, so d_i=0.005 m.

So ε₀ A / d_i = (8.85e-12) * 0.0753982 / 0.005.

Let me compute that:

8.85e-12 * 0.0753982 ≈ 6.67e-13.

Divided by 0.005 is 6.67e-13 / 0.005 = 1.334e-10 F.

So C1 = 1.334e-10 F * 3.5 ≈ 4.669e-10 F.

Similarly, C2 = 1.334e-10 F *8.5 ≈ 1.1339e-09 F.

Now, the total capacitance when two capacitors are in series is 1/C_total = 1/C1 + 1/C2.

So 1/C_total = (1/4.669e-10) + (1/1.1339e-9) ≈ (2.14e9) + (8.82e8) ≈ 3.022e9.

So C_total ≈ 1 / 3.022e9 ≈ 3.31e-10 F, which is 331 pF. Wait, but wait, the options are in pF and 10^-12 F. 331e-12 F is 331 pF, but looking at the options, I don't see 331 pF. Hmm, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, let me double-check the calculations. Oh wait, no—each dielectric is 5 mm, d=0.005 m. So ε₀ A / d would be (8.85e-12) * (0.0753982) / 0.005.

Let me compute that again:

8.85e-12 * 0.0753982 = 8.85e-12 * ~0.0754 ≈ 6.67e-13.

Divided by 0.005: 6.67e-13 / 0.005 = 1.334e-10 F.

So C1 = 1.334e-10 *3.5 ≈ 4.669e-10 F.

C2 = 1.334e-10 *8.5 ≈ 1.1339e-9 F.

Now, 1/C1 = 1/(4.669e-10) ≈ 2.14e9 S.

1/C2 = 1/(1.1339e-9) ≈ 8.82e8 S.

Sum is 2.14e9 + 0.882e9 ≈ 3.022e9 S.

C_total = 1 / 3.022e9 ≈ 3.31e-10 F = 331 pF. Hmm, but looking at the options, none have 331 pF. Wait, perhaps I messed up the unit conversions.

Wait, let me recheck the area calculation. Oh no! Wait, 240π cm² is 240 * π * (1e-2 m)^2, because 1 cm is 0.01 m. So 240π cm² is 240π * (1e-2)^2 = 240π * 1e-4 m² = 753.982e-4 m² = 0.0753982 m², which I think I did correctly.

Wait, or wait: 1 cm² is (1e-2 m)^2 = 1e-4 m². So 240π cm² is 240π * 1e-4 m² ≈ 240 *3.1416 *1e-4 ≈ 753.982e-4 ≈ 0.0753982 m². Correct.

Hmm, but the options have 278 pF, 282 pF, etc. Maybe I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps I should model the two dielectrics as being in series. Alternatively, maybe the formula is C_total = (ε1 + ε2) / 2 * something? No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the formula for multiple dielectrics in series is C = (ε₀ A) / (d1/ε1 + d2/ε2). Wait, that sounds familiar. Because when you have two dielectrics in series, each with thickness d1 and d2, and permittivities ε1 and ε2, the formula is C = (ε₀ A) / (d1/ε1 + d2/ε2).

Wait, that makes sense because the effective capacitance would be the reciprocal of the sum of the reciprocals, but each term is (d_i / (ε_i ε₀ A)).

Wait, let me think. The formula for two dielectrics in series is:

1/C_total = (d1/(ε1 ε₀ A)) + (d2/(ε2 ε₀ A))

Which can be written as (d1/(ε1) + d2/(ε2)) ) / (ε₀ A).

So C_total = (ε₀ A) / (d1/ε1 + d2/ε2).

Since in this case, d1 = d2 = 5 mm = 0.005 m, and ε1=3.5, ε2=8.5.

So denominator becomes (0.005 /3.5 ) + (0.005 /8.5 ) = 0.005*(1/3.5 + 1/8.5).

Compute 1/3.5 ≈ 0.2857, 1/8.5≈0.1176. Sum is ≈0.4033.

So denominator ≈ 0.005 *0.4033 ≈ 0.0020165.

Thus C_total = (8.85e-12 F/m * 0.0753982 m²) / (0.0020165).

Compute numerator: 8.85e-12 *0.0753982 ≈6.67e-13.

Divide by 0.0020165: 6.67e-13 / 0.0020165 ≈ 3.307e-10 F = 330.7 pF. So approximately 331 pF.

Wait, but looking at the options, part a) is the first value, and the options have various first parts. Let's see the options:

Option G: 330 ×1e-12 F, 282 ×1e-12 F, etc. Wait, 330e-12 F is 330 pF. So for part a), the capacitance is 330 pF. So that would match option G's first value. But I'm not sure if I did part a) correctly. Let me try another approach.

Alternatively, the formula when the dielectrics are in series is C_total = (ε₀ A) / (d1/ε1 + d2/ε2). So for two dielectrics each of 5 mm, ε1=3.5, ε2=8.5.

So plugging in: d1 = d2=0.005 m.

C = (8.85e-12 F/m * 0.0753982 m²) / (0.005/(3.5) + 0.005/(8.5)).

Compute denominator: 0.005/(3.5) = ~0.0014286, 0.005/(8.5)≈0.0005882. Sum ≈0.0020168.

Numerator: 8.85e-12 * 0.0753982 ≈ 6.67e-13.

So 6.67e-13 / 0.0020168 ≈ 3.307e-10 F = 330.7 pF, which is about 331 pF. So that's 330.7e-12 F, so 330.7 ×1e-12 F.

Looking at the options, option G has 330 ×1e-12 F as the first value. So part a) is 330e-12 F, or 330 pF.

Ok, that's part a). Now, moving to part b): 10 dielectrics, each with ε_r from 1.5, 2.5,..., up to 10.5. So each dielectric has ε_r increasing by 1 each time, but wait, 1.5, 2.5,... up to 10.5: that's (10.5 -1.5)/1 +1=10 steps, so 10 dielectrics, each with ε_r = 1.5, 2.5,...,10.5.

Each dielectric has the same thickness, which is d=10mm divided by 10, so 1 mm each, since there are 10 dielectrics. So each dielectric is 1 mm thick, which is 0.001 m.

Using the same approach as part a), the total capacitance is C_total = (ε₀ A) / sum (d_i/ε_i), where each d_i is 0.001 m, and ε_i ranges from 1.5 to 10.5 in steps of 1.0.

So sum (d_i/ε_i) = sum from ε=1.5 to 10.5, step 1, of (0.001/ ε).

So sum = 0.001 * [1/1.5 + 1/2.5 + 1/3.5 + ... +1/10.5 ].

Let me compute each term:

1/1.5 ≈ 0.666667
1/2.5 =0.4
1/3.5 ≈0.285714
1/4.5≈0.222222
1/5.5≈0.181818
1/6.5≈0.153846
1/7.5≈0.133333
1/8.5≈0.117647
1/9.5≈0.105263
1/10.5≈0.095238

Adding these up:

0.666667
+0.4 =1.066667
+0.285714=1.352381
+0.222222=1.574603
+0.181818=1.756421
+0.153846=1.910267
+0.133333=2.0436
+0.117647=2.161247
+0.105263=2.26651
+0.095238=2.361748.

So sum ≈2.361748.

Multiply by 0.001: 0.002361748.

Now, C_total = (8.85e-12 F/m * 0.0753982 m²) / 0.002361748.

Compute numerator: 8.85e-12 * 0.0753982 ≈6.67e-13.

So 6.67e-13 / 0.002361748 ≈ 2.824e-10 F = 282.4 pF, approximately 282 pF.

So part b) is approximately 282 ×1e-12 F.

Now, part c): one nonhomogeneous dielectric, with ε_r varying linearly from 1 to 11. So ε varies as a linear function from 1 to 11 across the 10 mm separation. So I need to model this as a continuous dielectric with ε_r(x) = 1 + (10)(x/d), where x is the distance from one end, and d=0.01 m.

Wait, actually, let me think. If ε varies linearly, then the relative permittivity as a function of position x (0 ≤ x ≤ d) is ε_r(x) = ε_0 + (ε_final - ε_0) * (x/d). Here, ε_0=1, ε_final=11, so ε_r(x) = 1 + (10)(x/0.01) = 1 + 1000 x. Wait, that can't be right because x is in meters, so 0.01 m is 10 mm. Wait, perhaps better to write as ε_r(x) = 1 + (10)(x/(0.01)), since the change is from 1 to 11 over 0.01 m. So ε_r(x) = 1 + 10*(x/0.01) = 1 + 1000 x, but that would make ε_r(0)=1, ε_r(0.01)=11, which is correct.

Wait, but the variation is linear with x. So the relative permittivity increases linearly from 1 to 11 across the 10 mm. So how does this affect the capacitance?

In such a case, the effective permittivity is the average of the starting and ending values, because the capacitance for a varying dielectric can be approximated by the average if it's linear. So the average ε_r is (1+11)/2=6.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute the capacitance using integration. The general formula for a varying ε_r is:

C = (ε₀ A) / ( ∫ (dx/ε_r(x)) )

Since the plates are separated by d, and ε_r varies from ε_0=1 to ε_d=11 over a distance d=0.01 m.

So ε_r(x) = 1 + (10)(x/d), which is 1 + (10/d) x.

Wait, because from x=0 to x=d, ε_r increases from 1 to 11, so the slope is (11-1)/d =10/d.

Thus, ε_r(x) = 1 + (10/d) x.

So the integral ∫ dx/ε_r(x) from 0 to d is ∫ dx/(1 + (10/d)x).

Let me compute this integral:

Let u = 1 + (10/d) x → du = (10/d) dx → dx = (d/10) du.

Limits: x=0 → u=1; x=d → u=11.

So integral becomes ∫ from u=1 to u=11 of (d/10) du / u = (d/10) ∫ (1/u) du.

Which is (d/10) [ln u] from 1 to 11 = (d/10)(ln 11 - ln 1) = (d/10) ln 11.

So ∫ dx/ε_r(x) = (d/10) ln 11.

Thus, C = (ε₀ A) / ( ∫ dx/ε_r(x) ) = (ε₀ A) / [ (d/10) ln 11 ) ] = (10 ε₀ A) / (d ln 11).

Now, plugging in the numbers:

ε₀ =8.85e-12 F/m,

A=0.0753982 m²,

d=0.01 m,

ln(11)≈2.3979.

So,

C = (10 * 8.85e-12 * 0.0753982) / (0.01 * 2.3979).

Compute numerator: 10 *8.85e-12=8.85e-11.

Multiply by 0.0753982: 8.85e-11 *0.0753982 ≈6.67e-12.

Denominator: 0.01 *2.3979≈0.023979.

So C ≈6.67e-12 / 0.023979 ≈2.785e-10 F = 278.5 pF, approximately 278 pF.

So part c) is 278 ×1e-12 F.

Now, compiling the three parts:

a) 330 ×1e-12 F,

b) 282 ×1e-12 F,

c) 278 ×1e-12 F.

Looking at the options, option G is: 330 ×1e-12 F, 282 ×1e-12 F, 278 PF.

Wait, option G's third value is 278 PF, which is 278e-12 F, so that's correct. So the correct option is G: 330, 282, 278 PF.
</think>

The problem involves calculating the capacitance of a capacitor with varying dielectric configurations. 

### Part (a): Two Dielectrics
For two dielectrics with $\epsilon_1 = 3.5$ and $\epsilon_2 = 8.5$, each occupying 5 mm thickness, the total capacitance is calculated using the series formula for capacitors. The effective capacitance is found to be approximately **330 pF**.
