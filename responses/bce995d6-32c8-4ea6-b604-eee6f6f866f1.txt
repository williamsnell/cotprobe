Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this multiple-choice question about group theory. There are two statements, and I need to determine if each is true or false, then see how they relate.

Statement 1 says, "The external direct product of cyclic groups is cyclic." I remember that the direct product of two groups G and H, denoted G × H, consists of all ordered pairs (g, h) where g is in G and h is in H. The operation is component-wise. Now, for cyclic groups, if both G and H are cyclic, does their direct product also cyclic?

I think the key here is the orders of the groups. If G and H have relatively prime orders, then their direct product is cyclic. Because the order of G × H would be |G| × |H|, and if they're coprime, the cyclic group of that order exists. But wait, the first statement doesn't specify that the orders are coprime. It just says the external direct product of cyclic groups is cyclic. So in general, that's not always true. For example, take Z_2 × Z_2. Both are cyclic, but their direct product is the Klein four-group, which is not cyclic because every element has order 2. So Statement 1 is false.

Now, Statement 2: "The external direct product of D_3 and D_4 is isomorphic to D_12." Hmm, D_n is the dihedral group of order 2n, right? So D_3 has order 6 (n=3, so 2×3=6), D_4 has order 8 (n=4, 2×4=8). Their direct product would have order 6×8=48. D_12 has order 24 (since n=12, 2×12=24). Wait, 48 vs 24—that's a problem. Because the direct product would have twice as many elements as D_12. So the orders are different, which means they can't be isomorphic. So Statement 2 is also false.

Wait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding. Could the direct product somehow be isomorphic to a larger dihedral group? No, because the orders don't match. D_12 is order 24, and D_3 × D_4 is order 48. So no, they can't be isomorphic. Therefore, Statement 2 is false.

So both statements are false. Looking at the options, I need to see which option says both are false. Let's check the options:

A: Statement 1 is an example of Statement 2, False. Hmm, not relevant here.

B: Both true? No.

C: True, False: No, because Statement 1 is false.

D: Both true but unrelated: No.

E: True, Statement 2 is an example of Statement 1: No, both are false.

F: Both true, but Statement 1 sometimes false: No, both are false.

G: False, True: No, both are false.

H: Statement 1 is dependent on Statement 2, False. Not sure, but both are false.

I: False, False. Yes, this matches.

J: Both false, but Statement 2 occasionally true: No, because in this case, it's not true.

So the correct answer is I: False, False.

The external direct product of cyclic groups is not always cyclic unless their orders are coprime. The direct product of D_3 and D_4 has a different order than D_12, making them non-isomorphic.
