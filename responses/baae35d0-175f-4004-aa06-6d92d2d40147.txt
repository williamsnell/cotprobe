Okay, so I have this question about photosynthesis, and I need to figure out which option is the source of the oxygen produced. Let me think about what I remember from biology class.

Photosynthesis is the process by which plants make their own food, right? And it's divided into two main stages: the light-dependent reactions and the Calvin cycle. The overall equation I remember is something like 6 CO2 + 6 H2O + light energy â†’ C6H12O2 + 6 O2. So oxygen is a product here.

Wait, the question is about the source of the oxygen. So looking at the equation, the oxygen comes from water. Because in the light-dependent reactions, water is split into oxygen gas, protons, and electrons. That's part of the process where the plant captures light energy and produces ATP and NADPH, which are used in the Calvin cycle.

Let me go through the options to make sure. Option D is H2O, which is water. That's definitely the source because the water molecules are broken down to release oxygen. The other options don't make sense. CO2 is used to make glucose and O2, but the oxygen comes from water, not CO2. Methane and other gases like N2 and O3 aren't involved in oxygen production in photosynthesis. Glucose is the product, not the source of O2. H2O2 is hydrogen peroxide, which is something else, maybe related to respiration or decomposition. Ozone is O3, which is different from O2. CO is carbon monoxide, not relevant here. Carbon (C) is part of glucose but not the source of O2.

So I'm pretty confident the answer is D: H2O.

The source of oxygen produced during photosynthesis is water (H2O). During the light-dependent reactions, water molecules are split, releasing oxygen gas as a byproduct.

Answer: D
