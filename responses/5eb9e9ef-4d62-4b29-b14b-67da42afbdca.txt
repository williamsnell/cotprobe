Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me, and I need to calculate the energy of one mole of UV photons with a wavelength of 300 nm. Then, I have to compare this energy with a typical single-bond energy of 400 kJ/mol. The options are given from A to J, and I have to choose the correct one.

Hmm, I remember that the energy of a photon can be calculated using the equation E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant, c is the speed of light, and λ is the wavelength. But wait, since we're dealing with a mole of photons, I think I need to use the concept of molar energy. Oh right, because photons come in large numbers, so for a mole, I should use Avogadro's number.

So let me jot down the constants first. Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s. The speed of light c is about 3.0 x 10^8 m/s. Avogadro's number N_A is 6.022 x 10^23 mol^-1.

The wavelength λ is given as 300 nm. Wait, nanometers are 10^-9 meters, so I should convert that to meters. So 300 nm is 300 x 10^-9 meters, which is 3 x 10^-7 meters.

Now, the energy per photon would be E_photon = hc/λ. Plugging the numbers in: (6.626e-34 J·s)(3.0e8 m/s) / (3e-7 m). Let me compute that numerator first: 6.626e-34 * 3.0e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m. Dividing by 3e-7 m gives (1.9878e-25) / (3e-7) = approximately 6.626e-19 J per photon.

Wait, wait, let me check that calculation again. 6.626e-34 * 3e8 is 1.9878e-25 J·m. Then dividing by 3e-7 m: 1.9878e-25 / 3e-7 = 6.626e-19 J. Yeah, that seems right.

Now, to find the energy for one mole of photons, I multiply by Avogadro's number. So E_mole = E_photon * N_A = (6.626e-19 J) * (6.022e23 mol^-1). Let's compute that. 6.626e-19 * 6.022e23 = (6.626 * 6.022) x 10^4. 

Calculating 6.626 * 6.022: 6 *6=36, 0.626*6=3.756, 6*0.022=0.132, and 0.626*0.022≈0.01377. Adding them up roughly: 36 +3.756=39.756 +0.132=39.888 +0.01377≈39.90177. So approximately 39.90177e4 J/mol, which is 3.990177e5 J/mol.

Wait, but wait a second, 6.626e-19 * 6.022e23 is 6.626 *6.022 = let me compute more accurately. 6 *6 is 36, 6 *0.022 is 0.132. 0.626 *6 is 3.756, 0.626 *0.022 ≈0.01377. So adding up 36 + 0.132 +3.756 +0.01377 = 39.9 + 0.01377 = 39.91377. So 39.91377e4 J/mol. Which is 399,137.7 J/mol. Oh wait, but 39.91377e4 is 399,137.7 J. Wait, 1e4 is 10,000, so 39.91377 *10,000 = 399,137.7 J/mol. Since 1 kJ is 1,000 J, this converts to 399.1377 kJ/mol.

Wait, but wait a minute, that's about 399 kJ per mole. The problem says to compare it with a typical single-bond energy of 400 kJ/mol. So the photon energy is about 399 kJ/mol, which is just under 400. Looking at the options, option H is 399 kJ/mol.

Wait, but wait again. Let me make sure I didn't make any calculation mistakes. Let me redo the multiplication step. E_photon = hc/λ = (6.626e-34)(3e8) / (3e-7). Let me compute that again.

Calculate numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = (6.626 *3) * 1e-34+8 = 19.878 * 1e-26 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Then, divide by λ=3e-7 m: 1.9878e-25 / 3e-7 = (1.9878 /3) * 1e-25 +7 = 0.6626e-18 = 6.626e-19 J per photon.

Then, per mole: 6.626e-19 J/photon * 6.022e23 photons/mol = (6.626 *6.022) * 1e4 J/mol. 6.626 *6.022 is approximately 39.9, so 39.9 *1e4 J = 399,000 J/mol, which is 399 kJ/mol.

So yes, that's correct. So the energy is approximately 399 kJ/mol, which is very close to the single bond energy of 400 kJ/mol. So the answer should be H: 399 kJ/mol.

Wait, but looking back at the options, option H is 399 kJ/mol. So that's the correct choice.

The energy of one mole of UV photons with a wavelength of 300 nm is calculated using the equation \( E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \), where \( h \) is Planck's constant, \( c \) is the speed of light, and \( \lambda \) is the wavelength. Converting the wavelength to meters (\( 300 \, \text{nm} = 3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m} \)) and plugging in the constants, the energy per photon is found to be approximately \( 6.626 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \). Multiplying by Avogadro's number (\( 6.022 \times 10^{23} \, \text{mol}^{-1} \)) gives the molar energy as \( 399 \, \text{kJ/mol} \). Comparing this with the given single-bond energy of \( 400 \, \text{kJ/mol} \), the closest match is option H.
