Okay, so I've got this problem here about calculating the standard enthalpy change for the combustion of ammonia. Hmm. I remember that enthalpy change is calculated using the enthalpies of formation of the products and reactants. The formula is ΔH° = Σ ΔHf°(products) - Σ ΔHf°(reactants). 

First, I need to write the balanced chemical equation for the combustion of NH3. Combustion usually involves reacting with oxygen to produce oxides. So ammonia would react with O2 to form NO and H2O. Let me try to balance that.

The unbalanced equation is: NH3 + O2 → NO + H2O.

Let me assign variables to the coefficients. Let's say a NH3, b O2 → c NO, d H2O.

So for nitrogen: a = c. For hydrogen: 3a = 2d (since H2O has two H each). For oxygen: 2b = c + d (since O2 is diatomic, and each O in NO and H2O comes from O2).

Let me solve these equations. From H: 3a = 2d → d = (3a)/2.

From N: a = c.

From O: 2b = c + d. Substituting c = a and d = (3a)/2, we get 2b = a + (3a/2) = (5a/2). So b = (5a)/4.

To eliminate fractions, let me choose a =4. Then c=4, d= (3*4)/2=6, and b=(5*4)/4=5.

So the balanced equation is: 4 NH3 +5 O2 →4 NO +6 H2O.

Wait, but wait—ammonia is NH3, and the products are NO and H2O. So that seems right.

Now, the next step is to use the enthalpies of formation given. The ΔHf values are:

H2O(l): -68.32 kcal/mol

NH3(g): -11.02 kcal/mol

NO(g): 21.57 kcal/mol

Wait, since NH3 is a reactant, its ΔHf will be subtracted. The products are NO and H2O, so their ΔHf will be added.

So the formula is ΔH°rxn = [4*(ΔHf(NO)) + 6*(ΔHf(H2O))] - [4*(ΔHf(NH3)) +5*(ΔHf(O2))].

But wait, O2 is in its standard state, so its ΔHf is zero. So the equation simplifies to:

ΔH°rxn = [4*(21.57) + 6*(-68.32)] - [4*(-11.02) +5*(0)].

Let me compute each part step by step.

First, the products:

4 * 21.57 = 86.28

6 * (-68.32) = -409.92

So products sum to 86.28 -409.92 = -323.64 kcal.

Now the reactants:

4 * (-11.02) = -44.08

5 * 0 = 0.

So reactants sum to -44.08.

Now ΔH°rxn = (-323.64) - (-44.08) = -323.64 +44.08 = -279.56 kcal/mol.

Looking at the options, option C is -279.56. So the answer should be C.

The balanced chemical equation for the combustion of ammonia is:

4 NH₃(g) + 5 O₂(g) → 4 NO(g) + 6 H₂O(l).

Using the enthalpies of formation provided, the standard enthalpy change is calculated as:

ΔH° = [4(21.57) + 6(-68.32)] - [4(-11.02) + 5(0)].

Calculating the products: 4(21.57) = 86.28, 6(-68.32) = -409.92, so total is -323.64 kcal.

Reactants: 4(-11.02) = -44.08, 5(0) = 0, so total is -44.08 kcal.

ΔH° = (-323.64) - (-44.08) = -279.56 kcal/mol.

The correct answer is C.
