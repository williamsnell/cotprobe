Okay, so I have this problem where I need to design a steel bar to withstand an axial load of 5500 lbs. based on the Euler load. The factor of safety is 2.5, and the length of the column is 222 inches. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think through it step by step.

First, I remember that Euler's formula is used to determine the critical load that a column can withstand before it buckles. The formula is Pcr = (π² * E * I) / (k² * L²), where E is Young's modulus, I is the moment of inertia, k is the effective length factor, and L is the length of the column. But wait, I also need to consider the factor of safety. So the actual load the column should be designed for is the critical load divided by the factor of safety.

The given axial load is 5500 lbs. Since the factor of safety is 2.5, the design load should be 5500 / 2.5 = 2200 lbs. So I need to find the diameter or the dimensions of the steel bar such that its critical load is at least 2200 lbs.

But wait, the problem is asking for the last character of the response, which is the letter corresponding to the correct option. The options are all in inches, so I think they're giving possible diameters or maybe side lengths of a square bar? I'm not sure if it's a circular or square bar, but since it's a steel bar, perhaps it's a round bar.

Assuming it's a circular bar, I can calculate the required radius or diameter. But I need some properties of the steel. I think the standard steel used for columns has a Young's modulus E around 29,000 ksi ( ksi = 1000 psi, so 29,000,000 psi). But I'm not entirely sure if that's correct. Let me confirm: yes, for steel, E is typically around 29,000 ksi.

Next, I need to find the moment of inertia I for a circular rod. Wait, no, I think I might be confusing terms. The moment of inertia for a rod is different for a column. Actually, for a rod in bending, the moment of inertia is (π * r^4)/4, where r is the radius. Since the bar is circular, the radius would be half of the diameter. But I'm not sure if I should use the area moment of inertia or just the radius. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the radius of gyration. Because Euler's formula can also be written as Pcr = (π² * E * (I/A)) / (k² * L²), where I is the moment of inertia and A is the cross-sectional area. The term (I/A) is the radius of gyration squared, r². So maybe it's easier to approach it that way.

So, the radius of gyration r for a solid circular rod is (d/4), where d is the diameter. Because for a solid circle, the radius of gyration about its central axis is r = d/4. So, r = d/4.

So, putting that into Euler's formula, Pcr = (π² * E * (d/4)²) / (k² * L²). Wait, no, wait. Let me double-check that. The moment of inertia I for a circular rod is (π * d^4)/64, and the area A is π*(d/2)^2 = π*d²/4. So I/A is (π d^4 /64) / (π d²/4) )= (d² / 16). So the radius of gyration r is sqrt(I/A) = d/(4). So yes, r = d/4.

So, Pcr = (π² * E * r²) / (k² * L²). Substituting r = d/4, that becomes Pcr = (π² * E * (d²/16)) / (k² * L²) = (π² * E * d²) / (16 * k² * L²).

But I also need to consider the effective length factor k. For a column that's pinned at both ends, k is 1. If it's fixed at both ends, k is 0.5. But the problem doesn't specify, so I think the default is to assume k=1, meaning it's pinned at both ends.

So, k=1, so the formula simplifies to Pcr = (π² * E * d²) / (16 * L²).

Now, I have Pcr, but I need to set Pcr equal to the design load, which is 2200 lbs. So:

2200 = (π² * 29,000 * d²) / (16 * (222)^2 )

Let me compute the right-hand side step by step.

First, calculate π²: approximately 9.8696.

So, π² * 29,000 ≈ 9.8696 * 29,000 ≈ let's see: 9 * 29,000 is 261,000, 0.8696 *29,000 ≈ about 25,218.4, so total is approximately 286,218.4.

Denominator: 16 * (222)^2. 222 squared is 222 * 222. Let me calculate that: 200^2 =40,000, 22^2=484, and cross term 2*200*22=8,800. So 222^2 = (200+22)^2 = 40,000 + 8,800 + 484 = 49,284. So 16 * 49,284 = 788,544.

So now, Pcr = (286,218.4 * d²) / 788,544 ≈ (286218.4 / 788544) * d² ≈ let me compute 286218.4 / 788544.

Dividing numerator and denominator by 1000: 286.2184 / 788.544 ≈ approximately 0.362.

So, 0.362 * d² = 2200.

So, d² = 2200 / 0.362 ≈ let's compute that: 2200 / 0.362 ≈ 6077.35.

Then, d = sqrt(6077.35) ≈ 77.96 inches? Wait, that can't be right. Wait, that's way too big. I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, no, wait. 222 inches is the length, which is 18.5 feet. So a column 18.5 feet long with a diameter of 78 inches seems way too large. That can't be right. I must have messed up the calculations.

Wait, let me double-check the units. E is in ksi, which is 1000 psi, so 29,000 ksi is 29,000,000 psi. But in the formula, all terms should be in consistent units. Wait, maybe I messed up the units conversion.

Wait, in the formula Pcr is in pounds, E is in psi, d is in inches, so let's make sure the units work out.

Wait, perhaps I should convert E into the same units as Pcr. Let me recast everything in consistent units.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use E in psi, and the length in inches, and the load in pounds. Let me redo the calculation carefully.

So, E = 29,000 ksi = 29,000,000 psi.

So, Pcr = (π² * E * d²) / (16 * L² )

Plug in the numbers:

Pcr = (9.8696) * (29,000,000) * d² / (16 * (222)^2 )

Compute numerator: 9.8696 * 29,000,000 ≈ let's compute 9 * 29e6 = 261e6, 0.8696 *29e6 ≈ 25.2184e6. So total ≈ 286.2184e6.

Denominator: 16 * (222)^2 = 16 * 49,284 = 788,544.

So Pcr = (286.2184e6 * d²) / 788,544 ≈ (286.2184e6 / 788,544) * d².

Compute 286.2184e6 / 788,544: 286,218,400 / 788,544 ≈ approximately 362.14.

So Pcr ≈ 362.14 * d².

Set Pcr equal to 2200 lbs:

362.14 * d² = 2200 ⇒ d² = 2200 / 362.14 ≈ 6.073 ⇒ d ≈ sqrt(6.073) ≈ 2.464 inches.

Wait, that makes more sense. So the diameter d is approximately 2.464 inches.

Looking at the options, the choices are in inches. The options are:

A: 1 5/8 (1.625)
B: 2
C: 1 1/2 (1.5)
D: 1 3/4 (1.75)
E: 2 1/4 (2.25)
F: 1 1/4 (1.25)
G: 2 1/2 (2.5)
H: 1 7/8 (1.875)
I: 1 11/16 (1.6875)
J: 1 7/16 (1.4375)

So 2.464 inches is approximately 2.46 inches, which is between 2 1/4 (2.25) and 2 1/2 (2.5). So the closest option is E: 2 1/4 (2.25) or G: 2 1/2 (2.5). But 2.46 is closer to 2.5 than to 2.25. Wait, 2.46 is 0.21 above 2.25 and 0.04 below 2.5. So the closest is G: 2 1/2 inches.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check.

Wait, when I calculated 286.2184e6 / 788,544, I did 286,218,400 / 788,544 ≈ 362.14. But let me check that division again.

788,544 * 362 = ?

Well, 788,544 * 300 = 236,563,200.

788,544 * 60 = 47,312,640.

788,544 * 2 = 1,577,088.

Adding them up: 236,563,200 + 47,312,640 = 283,875,840, plus 1,577,088 is 285,452,928.

But the numerator is 286,218,400. So 788,544 * 362 ≈ 285,452,928, which is less than 286,218,400. The difference is 286,218,400 - 285,452,928 = 765,472.

Now, 765,472 / 788,544 ≈ 0.971. So 788,544 * 0.971 ≈ 765,472. So total multiplier is 362 + 0.971 ≈ 362.971.

So, 286,218,400 / 788,544 ≈ 362.971.

So Pcr ≈ 362.971 * d².

Set to 2200:

362.971 * d² = 2200 ⇒ d² = 2200 / 362.971 ≈ 6.064.

d = sqrt(6.064) ≈ 2.462 inches.

So about 2.46 inches, which is 2 and 0.46 inches. Since 0.46 is less than 0.5, the nearest 1/16th inch would be 2 7/16 inches (since 0.4375 is 7/16), but the options don't have that. Wait, the options are in fractions: E is 2 1/4 (2.25), G is 2 1/2 (2.5), and I is 1 11/16 (1.6875), J is 1 7/16 (1.4375). Wait, none of the options are between 2.25 and 2.5 except E and G. So the closest is G: 2 1/2 inches. But wait, 2.46 is closer to 2.5 than to 2.25. Let me see: 2.46 is 0.21 above 2.25 and 0.04 below 2.5. So it's much closer to 2.5. So the answer should be G: 2 1/2 inches.

Wait, but wait a second. Did I make a mistake in the formula? Because if the bar is a square, the radius of gyration would be different. Oh wait, I assumed it's a circular bar. But the question just says a steel bar, so maybe it's a square bar. Let me reevaluate that.

If it's a square bar, the radius of gyration would be (s/2) * sqrt(3)/3, where s is the side length. Because for a square, the moment of inertia about its central axis is (s^4)/12, and area A is s². So I/A = (s^4/12)/s² = s²/12. So radius of gyration r = sqrt(s²/12) = s/(2*sqrt(3)) ≈ s/(3.464).

So in that case, the formula would be Pcr = (π² * E * (s/(2*sqrt(3)))^2 ) / (k² L² )

Which simplifies to Pcr = (π² * E * s² ) / (12 * k² * L² )

So with k=1, Pcr = (π² * E * s² ) / (12 * L² )

Plugging in E=29,000,000 psi, L=222 inches.

So Pcr = (9.8696 * 29e6 * s²) / (12 * 222^2 )

Compute denominator: 12 * (222)^2 = 12 * 49,284 = 591,408.

Numerator: 9.8696 * 29e6 ≈ 286,218,400.

So Pcr = (286,218,400 * s² ) / 591,408 ≈ (286,218,400 / 591,408 ) * s² ≈ 484.2 * s².

Set Pcr = 2200:

484.2 * s² = 2200 ⇒ s² = 2200 / 484.2 ≈ 4.544 ⇒ s ≈ 2.132 inches.

Looking at the options, 2.132 inches is approximately 2 1/8 inches, but that's not an option. The options are:

E: 2 1/4 (2.25)
G: 2 1/2 (2.5)

So 2.132 is between E (2.25) and something smaller. The closest option would be E: 2 1/4 inches, but wait, 2.132 is closer to 2.125 (which is 2 1/8) than to 2.25. But the options don't have 2 1/8. So perhaps the bar is circular, and the answer is G: 2 1/2 inches.

But wait, earlier when I assumed it was a circular bar, the required diameter was about 2.46 inches, which is very close to 2.5 inches, so option G.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider whether the bar is a W-shape or something else, but I think the question is assuming a simple circular or square bar.

Given that, I think the correct answer is G: 2 1/2 inches.

To design a steel bar to withstand an axial load of 5500 lbs. with a factor of safety of 2.5, the design load is reduced to 2200 lbs. Using Euler's formula for a column of length 222 inches, the critical load \( P_{cr} \) is calculated. Assuming a circular cross-section with Young's modulus \( E = 29,000,000 \) psi, the required diameter is found to be approximately 2.46 inches. Among the given options, the closest match is **G: 2 1/2 inches**.
