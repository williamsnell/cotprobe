Okay, so I need to solve the math problem 110 plus 70. Let me think about how to approach this. I remember that when adding two numbers, I should line them up by their place values. So, 110 is the same as 100 + 10, and 70 is just 70. 

Let me write it down to visualize it better. 

110
+70

Starting from the right, I add the ones place. 0 plus 0 is 0. Then the tens place: 1 plus 7 is 8. Finally, the hundreds place: 1 plus 0 is 1. So putting it all together, that's 180. 

Wait, did I do that right? Let me double-check. 110 plus 70... another way to think about it is that 70 is close to 70, so adding it to 100 would be 180, but since 110 is 10 more than 100, it's 180. Yeah, that makes sense. 

Looking at the options, J is 180. So the correct answer should be J.

The sum of 110 and 70 is 180.
