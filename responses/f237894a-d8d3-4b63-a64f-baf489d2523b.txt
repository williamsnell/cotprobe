Okay, so I've got this problem here about a right triangle. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question says the hypotenuse is 10 inches and one angle is 45 degrees. I need to find the area of the triangle in square inches.

Hmm, right triangles have one right angle (90 degrees) and two other angles. Since one of the angles is 45 degrees, that means the other non-right angle must also be 45 degrees because the angles in a triangle add up to 180. So, 90 + 45 + something = 180. Wait, no, wait. If one angle is 45, the other is also 45 because 45 + 45 +90=180. So this is a 45-45-90 triangle. Oh right, that's an isosceles right triangle, meaning the two legs are equal in length.

In a 45-45-90 triangle, the legs are of equal length, and the hypotenuse is leg * sqrt(2). So if I let each leg be 'a', then hypotenuse is a√2. Since the hypotenuse is given as 10 inches, I can set up the equation a√2 = 10. To find 'a', I divide both sides by √2. So a = 10 / √2. But wait, I remember that sometimes you rationalize the denominator. So 10 divided by √2 is the same as (10√2)/2, which simplifies to 5√2. So each leg is 5√2 inches long.

Now, the area of a triangle is (base * height)/2. In a right triangle, the two legs can serve as base and height. Since both are 5√2, the area would be (5√2 * 5√2)/2. Let me compute that. 5 times 5 is 25, and √2 times √2 is 2. So 25*2 is 50. Then, divide by 2, so 50/2 is 25. Wait, is that right? Let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, no. Let me recalculate: (5√2) * (5√2) = (5*5)*(√2 * √2) = 25 * 2 = 50. Then, area is 50 divided by 2, which is 25. So the area is 25 square inches.

Looking at the options, option G is 25. So the answer should be G.

The triangle is a 45-45-90 right triangle with a hypotenuse of 10 inches. In such a triangle, the legs are equal, and each leg is \( \frac{10}{\sqrt{2}} = 5\sqrt{2} \) inches. The area is \( \frac{1}{2} \times (5\sqrt{2})^2 = 25 \) square inches.

Answer: G
