Question:

Assume that the Black-Scholes framework holds. The price of a nondividened-paying stock is $30. The price of a put option on this stock is $4.00. You are given $(i) $\Delta=-0.28$.

B: 2.9
C: 4.8
D: 3.0
E: 3.7
F: 4.5
G: 5.0

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Black-Scholes options pricing question using the delta-gamma approximation. Let me break this down step by step because I'm a bit new to this.

First, the problem states that we have a nondividend-paying stock with a current price of $30. The put option on this stock is priced at $4.00. We are given the delta (Δ) as -0.28 and gamma (Γ) as 0.10. The task is to find the new price of the put option if the stock price changes to $31.50. The options are given from A to J, and I need to choose the correct one.

I remember that the delta-gamma approximation is a method used to estimate the change in the option's price when the underlying asset's price changes. It's a second-order approximation, meaning it considers both the first derivative (delta) and the second derivative (gamma) of the option's value with respect to the stock price.

The formula I think I need to use is:

ΔC ≈ Δ*S + 0.5 * Γ*(ΔS)^2

Where:
- ΔC is the change in the option's price.
- Δ is the delta of the option.
- S is the change in the stock price.
- Γ is the gamma of the option.
- ΔS is the change in the stock price.

Let me make sure I have all the values right.

Original stock price (S_initial): $30
New stock price (S_final): $31.50
So, the change in stock price (ΔS) is S_final - S_initial = 31.50 - 30 = $1.50.

Wait, no, wait. Actually, in the formula, ΔS is the change, which is 1.50. But wait, in the formula, is it squared? Yes, because gamma is the second derivative, so the second term is quadratic.

The original put option price is $4.00. We need to find the new price after the stock moves.

So, plugging in the values:

ΔC ≈ Δ * (ΔS) + 0.5 * Γ * (ΔS)^2

But wait, delta (Δ) is given as -0.28. Gamma is 0.10.

So, ΔS is +1.50 (since the stock went up from 30 to 31.50). So, let's compute each part.

First term: Δ * ΔS = (-0.28) * 1.50 = -0.42.

Second term: 0.5 * Γ * (ΔS)^2 = 0.5 * 0.10 * (1.50)^2.

Calculating (1.50)^2: that's 2.25.

So, 0.5 * 0.10 = 0.05.

0.05 * 2.25 = 0.1125.

So the second term is +0.1125.

Adding both terms: -0.42 + 0.1125 = -0.3075.

So, ΔC ≈ -0.3075.

This means the change in the option's price is approximately -$0.3075.

The original price was $4.00, so the new price would be 4.00 - 0.3075 = 3.6925.

Looking at the options, let's see which is closest to 3.69. The options are:

A:5.5, B:2.9, C:4.8, D:3.0, E:3.7, F:4.5, G:5.0, H:2.5, I:4.2, J:3.9.

Option E is 3.7, which is very close to 3.69. So, I think E is the correct answer.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

ΔS is +1.50. Delta is -0.28, so the first term is -0.28 * 1.5 = -0.42. Correct.

Gamma is 0.10, so 0.5 * 0.10 = 0.05. (1.5)^2 is 2.25. 0.05 * 2.25 is 0.1125. Correct.

So total change is -0.42 + 0.1125 = -0.3075. So new price is 4.00 - 0.3075 = 3.6925, which rounds to 3.69, but the options have E as 3.7, so that's the closest.

I think I did everything correctly. So the answer should be E.

The delta-gamma approximation is used to estimate the change in the put option's price when the stock price changes. The formula is:

ΔC ≈ Δ * ΔS + 0.5 * Γ * (ΔS)^2

Given:
- Δ = -0.28
- Γ = 0.10
- ΔS = 31.50 - 30 = 1.50

Calculating each term:
1. Δ * ΔS = (-0.28) * 1.50 = -0.42
2. 0.5 * Γ * (ΔS)^2 = 0.5 * 0.10 * (1.50)^2 = 0.05 * 2.25 = 0.1125

Total change: ΔC ≈ -0.42 + 0.1125 = -0.3075

New put price: 4.00 - 0.3075 ≈ 3.6925, which rounds to 3.7. 

The closest option is E: 3.7.

Answer: E
