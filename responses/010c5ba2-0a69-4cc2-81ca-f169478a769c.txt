Okay, so I have this question about how arrays are declared in PL/I. I'm a bit rusty on my PL/I syntax, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

First, I remember that in PL/I, array declarations have a specific structure. I think the general form involves the keyword ARRAY, followed by the name of the array, and then some dimension attributes. But I'm not entirely sure about the exact order.

I recall that when declaring variables in PL/I, you typically use the DCL keyword. So the declaration starts with DCL, then the data attributes, then the type (like array), the name, and then the dimension attributes if it's an array.

Wait, let me think about the order. I believe the syntax is something like:

DCL [data attributes] [type] [name] [(dimension attributes)];

For arrays, the type is ARRAY, and then you specify the dimensions. So putting it together, it might look like:

DCL DATA ATTRIBUTES ARRAY NAME (DIMENSION ATTRIBUTES);

Looking at the options, I need to find which one matches this structure.

Let me go through the options one by one.

Option A: DATA ATTRIBUTES DCL ARRAY (DIMENSION ATTRIBUTES) NAME;
Wait, that doesn't seem right. The DCL should come after the data attributes, not after ARRAY.

Option B: ARRAY NAME DCL (DIMENSION ATTRIBUTES) DATA ATTRIBUTES;
Hmm, no. The DCL is in the middle, which doesn't fit. The correct order should have DCL first, then data attributes, then array, then name, then dimensions.

Option C: DCL DATA ATTRIBUTES ARRAY NAME (DIMENSION ATTRIBUTES);
This looks promising. It starts with DCL, then data attributes, then ARRAY, then the name, followed by the dimensions in parentheses. That matches what I was thinking.

Option D: ARRAY (DIMENSION ATTRIBUTES) NAME DCL DATA ATTRIBUTES;
No, the DCL is after the name, which isn't right. The DCL should be at the beginning.

Option E: ARRAY DCL NAME (DIMENSION ATTRIBUTES) DATA ATTRIBUTES;
Again, DCL is in the wrong place. It should be at the start.

Option F: (DIMENSION ATTRIBUTES) DCL ARRAY NAME DATA ATTRIBUTES;
No, the dimensions are in the wrong place. They should be after the array name.

Option G: NAME DCL DATA ATTRIBUTES ARRAY (DIMENSION ATTRIBUTES);
No, the name comes after the data attributes and array keyword, which isn't correct.

Option H: DCL (DIMENSION ATTRIBUTES) ARRAY NAME DATA ATTRIBUTES;
The dimensions are in the wrong place here too; they should be after the array name in parentheses.

Option I: NAME ARRAY DCL (DIMENSION ATTRIBUTES) DATA ATTRIBUTES;
No, the DCL is in the middle, and the name comes before DCL, which is wrong.

Option J: DCL ARRAY NAME (DIMENSION ATTRIBUTES) DATA ATTRIBUTES;
Wait, this also seems possible. It starts with DCL, then ARRAY, then the name, then dimensions in parentheses. But where are the data attributes? Oh, I see, it's after the dimensions. So the order is DCL, ARRAY, NAME, (dimensions), then data attributes.

But I thought the data attributes come before the type. So in the correct syntax, data attributes are declared before the type (like ARRAY). So the correct order should be DCL, data attributes, ARRAY, name, (dimensions).

Looking back, option C is DCL DATA ATTRIBUTES ARRAY NAME (DIMENSION ATTRIBUTES); which fits that structure.

Wait, but option J is DCL ARRAY NAME (DIMENSION ATTRIBUTES) DATA ATTRIBUTES. That would mean data attributes are after the array declaration, which I think is incorrect because data attributes like INITIAL, VALUE, etc., should come after the type declaration but before the dimensions. Or wait, maybe not. Let me think again.

In PL/I, the order is:

DCL [data attributes] [type] [name] [dimensions];

So data attributes come right after DCL, before the type.

So, for an array, it would be:

DCL [data attributes] ARRAY [name] ([dimensions]);

Therefore, the correct format should have data attributes between DCL and ARRAY.

Looking at option C: DCL DATA ATTRIBUTES ARRAY NAME (DIMENSION ATTRIBUTES); That fits because after DCL comes data attributes, then ARRAY, then name, then dimensions.

But wait, option J is DCL ARRAY NAME (DIMENSION ATTRIBUTES) DATA ATTRIBUTES. That would put data attributes after the array declaration, which doesn't seem right. Because data attributes like INITIAL would come before the array name, not after.

So the correct answer should be option C.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me check an example. Suppose I want to declare a one-dimensional array of integers. The correct declaration would be:

DCL DATA ATTRIBUTES ARRAY A (1:10);

Or, if I have initial values:

DCL INITIAL (1,2,3,4,5) ARRAY A (1:10);

So yes, the data attributes come right after DCL, followed by ARRAY, then the name, then the dimensions in parentheses.

Therefore, the correct option is C: DCL DATA ATTRIBUTES ARRAY NAME (DIMENSION ATTRIBUTES);
</think>

The correct format for declaring an array in PL/I involves starting with the DCL keyword, followed by data attributes, then the keyword ARRAY, the array name, and finally the dimension attributes in parentheses. This structure ensures that data attributes are specified before the array type and name.
