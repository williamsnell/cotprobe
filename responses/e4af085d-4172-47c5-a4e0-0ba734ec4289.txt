Okay, so I have this question here: "How many states were in the Confederate States of America?" The options are A through J, with numbers ranging from 10 to 22. I'm a bit fuzzy on my American history, but I'll try to work through this step by step.

First, I remember that the Confederate States of America (CSA) was the group of Southern states that seceded from the United States before the Civil War. The Civil War started in 1861, so I'm thinking about the states that were part of the South at that time.

I know that the main Southern states were the ones that had plantation economies relying heavily on slavery. The original states that were part of the CSA, I believe, were the 11 states that actually seceded before the war started. These included states like South Carolina, Georgia, Texas, and so on. But wait, I'm not sure if more states joined later.

Let me think about when each state seceded. South Carolina was the first to secede in December 1860, followed by Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, and Texas by February 1861. Then, in April 1861, after the attack on Fort Sumter, Virginia seceded. That was followed by Arkansas, Tennessee, and North Carolina by June 1861. So that's 11 states in total. But I'm trying to remember if any other states ever joined the CSA after that.

I think about Kentucky and Missouri. I believe they had some Confederate support, but they never officially seceded and were instead part of what's called "loyal" states. Their Confederate factions sometimes operated within the Union but weren't recognized as part of the CSA. So they don't count towards the total number of states in the CSA.

Also, I recall that the CSA was sometimes referred to as the "Confederacy," and it's often associated with the 11 Southern states. I've heard the term "the original 11" used in this context. So that makes me think that the answer is 11.

Looking back at the options, B is 11. So I think that's the correct answer. The other options are higher numbers, but I don't think the CSA had more than 11 states. Some people might confuse the number of battles or events, but in terms of actual states that seceded and were part of the CSA, it's 11.

The Confederate States of America (CSA) consisted of 11 Southern states that seceded from the United States before the Civil War. These states were South Carolina, Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Texas, Virginia, Arkansas, Tennessee, and North Carolina. While some other states like Kentucky and Missouri had Confederate sympathies, they did not officially secede and were not part of the CSA. Therefore, the correct number of states in the CSA is 11.

Answer: B
