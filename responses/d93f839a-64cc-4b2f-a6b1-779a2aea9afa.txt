B: Glycolysis doesn't require any enzymes
C: In glycolysis, glucose is cleaved into two three-carbon products

Okay, so I've got this question about glucose metabolism, and I need to figure out which statement is correct. Let me go through each option one by one.

Starting with Option A: "The end-product of glycolysis in all cells is glucose." Hmm, that doesn't sound right. Glycolysis is the process where glucose is broken down, so the end product shouldn't be glucose again. I think the end products are more likely to be something like pyruvate or lactate, depending on the conditions. So A is probably incorrect.

Option B: "Glycolysis doesn't require any enzymes." That can't be true. Metabolic pathways like glycolysis rely heavily on enzymes to catalyze the reactions. Without enzymes, those reactions wouldn't happen efficiently. So B is definitely wrong.

Option C: "In glycolysis, glucose is cleaved into two three-carbon products." This rings a bell. I remember that glucose, which is a six-carbon molecule, is split into two three-carbon molecules during glycolysis. Those are probably pyruvate or something similar. So C sounds correct.

Option D: "Glucose metabolism only occurs in the presence of oxygen." Wait, isn't glucose metabolism part of cellular respiration, which can happen with or without oxygen? Like, anaerobic respiration doesn't require oxygen but still involves glycolysis. So D is incorrect because glucose metabolism can occur without oxygen.

Option E: "In glycolysis, glucose is converted into two molecules of fructose." No, that doesn't make sense. I think glucose is broken down, not converted into fructose. Fructose is a different sugar, so E is incorrect.

Option F: "Glycolysis requires ATP only." I remember that glycolysis actually uses ATP in the first steps but also produces ATP later on. So it's not just requiring ATP; it's a net gain. So F is wrong because it also produces ATP, not just uses it.

Option G: "Glucagon increases the rate of glycolysis." Glucagon is involved in increasing blood sugar levels, so it probably enhances glycogen breakdown, not directly increasing glycolysis. I think insulin is more about promoting anabolism and glycolysis. So G is incorrect.

Option H: "Glycolysis requires NADP+." NADP+ is more associated with reactions like the pentose phosphate pathway and maybe some other redox reactions. In glycolysis, I believe NAD+ is used and gets reduced to NADH. So H is wrong because it's NAD+ that's involved, not NADP+.

So, reviewing all options, the correct statement is C: In glycolysis, glucose is cleaved into two three-carbon products.

The correct statement is C: In glycolysis, glucose is cleaved into two three-carbon products.

Answer: C
