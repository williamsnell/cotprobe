Okay, so I have this question about hormones involved in puberty for both females and males. Let me think through this step by step. 

Puberty is the period when a child's body matures into an adult, and it involves a lot of hormonal changes. I remember that the process is driven by the hypothalamus, which releases gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). This then triggers the pituitary gland to release two key hormones: FSH (follicle stimulating hormone) and LH (luteinizing hormone). These hormones are crucial because they stimulate the gonads, which are the ovaries in females and testes in males, to produce sex hormones.

In females, the primary sex hormones are estrogen and progesterone. Estrogen is responsible for the development of secondary sexual characteristics like breast development, while progesterone plays a role in the menstrual cycle. In males, the main hormone is testosterone, which drives changes like facial hair growth, deepening of the voice, and muscle development.

Looking at the options, option H mentions FSH, LH, estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone. That seems to cover all the main hormones involved. Let me double-check the other options to make sure I'm not missing something.

Option A talks about Cortisol, aldosterone, and adrenal androgens. Cortisol and aldosterone are stress and mineral corticoid hormones, respectively, not directly related to puberty. Adrenal androgens might contribute a bit, but they're not the main drivers.

Option B is about insulin, glucagon, and somatostatin, which are all related to metabolism and blood sugar regulation. Not relevant here.

Option C includes cholecystokinin, ghrelin, and leptin. Those are hormones involved in digestion and appetite, so not related to puberty.

Option D lists vasopressin, erythropoietin, and renin. These are related to blood pressure, red blood cell production, and kidney function, respectively. Not the ones causing puberty changes.

Option E has epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine, which are neurotransmitters and part of the fight-or-flight response, not puberty.

Option F is melatonin, serotonin, and endorphins. These are hormones related to sleep, mood, and pain relief, not directly causing puberty changes.

Option G includes growth hormone, prolactin, and oxytocin. Growth hormone does contribute to growth during puberty, but it's not the main driver of the sexual changes. Prolactin is more about lactation, and oxytocin is for bonding and childbirth.

Option I is calcitonin, parathyroid hormone, and vitamin D, which relate to calcium regulation and bone health, but again, not the main puberty hormones.

Option J is thyroxine and triiodothyronine, which are thyroid hormones involved in metabolism and growth, but not specifically puberty's sexual changes.

So, putting it all together, the correct answer should be option H because it includes FSH, LH, which are the gonadotropins, and the sex hormones estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone, which are key in the changes during puberty for both males and females.
