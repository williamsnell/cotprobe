The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

A woman is the owner of record of a parcel of land designated as "A. " It is the highest of three neighboring properties on a mountain. The woman's sister owns parcel "C," which lies the lowest on the mountain. Parcel "B" lies between Parcels "A" andIn 2000, the woman who originally owned all three parcels of land constructed a private drainage system. This system consisted of an underground pipeline that extended across all three parcels of land. Sewage from parcel "A" drained through the system to a municipal sewer, which was located at the bottom of the mountain. In 2005, the sister purchased parcel "C" from the woman. The deed to the sister did not contain any mention of the woman's drainage system. Located on each of the parcels are large ranch-style homes occupied by the respective owners. A portion of the sister's unimproved land began to subside over the drainage system. This was because of an especially pliable soil condition of which the woman was unaware prior to construction of the drainage system. In an action brought by the sister against the woman to recover property damage for the subsidence of her land, judgment should be for whom?

Options:

A: The woman, unless it can be proven that she intentionally hid the condition of the soil.
B: The woman, because the sister did not maintain the drainage system on her property.
C: The woman, because the sister purchased the property with full knowledge of the existing drainage system.
D: The sister, because the woman did not include any mention of the drainage system in the deed.
E: The sister, because the woman should have tested the soil before constructing the drainage system.
F: The sister, because she is entitled to subjacent support for her land in its natural condition.
G: The woman, unless she sister proves that the woman was negligent in constructing the drainage system.
H: The sister, because she is entitled to support for her land in its improved condition.
I: The sister, because she is entitled to lateral support for her land in its natural condition.
J: The woman, because the sister did not perform a thorough inspection before purchasing the property.

Okay, so I need to figure out the answer to this legal question. Let me read through it carefully.

The scenario involves a woman who owns parcel A, which is the highest of three neighboring properties on a mountain. Her sister owns parcel C, the lowest, and parcel B is in between. In 2000, the woman constructed a private drainage system across all three parcels. The sewage from A goes through this system to a municipal sewer at the bottom.

In 2005, the sister buys parcel C from the woman, and the deed doesn't mention the drainage system. Now, a part of the sister's land is subsiding because the soil is especially pliable, and the woman didn't know about this soil condition before building the drainage system. The sister is suing for property damage.

The question is about who should get judgment: the woman or the sister.

I think this is a property law issue, probably related to support and lateral or subjacent support. Let me recall what I know about this.

Subjacent support refers to the natural support that land receives from underlying land. If someone's land is undermined, the owner may be entitled to support. But if the land was already improved, like with a building, lateral support is about the support provided by adjacent land.

Wait, in this case, the sister's land is subsiding because of the drainage system. The drainage system was built by the woman across all parcels. So, the sister's parcel C is at the bottom, and the drainage system is under her land.

The sister's land is unimproved, just land with a ranch-style home. So, the subsidence is causing damage to her land. The woman didn't know about the soil condition before building the drainage system.

So, the sister is suing for damage. The options involve whether the woman is liable or not.

Looking at the options:

A: Woman wins unless she intentionally hid the soil condition. So, if she didn't know, she's not liable.

B: Woman wins because sister didn't maintain the system. But the sister didn't know it existed since the deed didn't mention it.

C: Woman wins if sister had full knowledge. But the deed didn't mention it, so sister might not have known.

D: Sister wins because the deed didn't mention the system. But does that make her entitled to damages?

E: Sister wins because woman should have tested the soil. But the woman didn't know about the condition, and maybe testing wasn't required.

F: Sister is entitled to subjacent support. Subjacent support is about the natural state. But the drainage system is an artificial structure. Maybe the sister's land is being damaged due to the woman's actions on adjacent land.

G: Woman wins unless sister proves negligence. So, if the woman was negligent, sister can win. If not, woman wins.

H: Sister entitled to support for improved land. But her land was unimproved except for the home.

I: Sister entitled to lateral support in natural condition. Wait, lateral support is between adjacent parcels. The sister's parcel is C, and the woman owns A. But the drainage system is under C. So, maybe the woman is using C's land for the drainage, which could affect the support.

Wait, lateral support is typically about the support provided by neighboring land. If someone digs into their land, they can't undermine their neighbor's land. So, if the woman's drainage system is affecting the sister's parcel, maybe it's a lateral support issue.

But in this case, the woman owns A, B, and C initially, but she sold C to her sister. Now, the sister's land is subsiding because of the drainage system. The woman built it without knowing the soil was pliable.

So, the sister is claiming that the woman's drainage system on her land (C) caused the subsidence. But the woman built the system when she owned all three. After selling C, the system is still there.

In property law, when a landowner digs into their land, they must provide lateral support to adjacent land. So, if the woman's drainage system (like a tunnel or pipe) is under the sister's land (C), she might have a duty to provide lateral support.

Wait, but the woman no longer owns C. She sold it to her sister. So, the sister owns C, and the drainage system is on her land. But the woman built it when she owned all parcels.

So, the sister's claim would be against the woman for damage caused by the drainage system. But since the woman no longer owns C, does she have any liability?

Alternatively, perhaps the sister is claiming that the woman's construction of the drainage system on her (sister's) land without disclosing it caused the subsidence.

Wait, the deed didn't mention the drainage system, so the sister didn't know about it when she bought the property. So, she might argue that the woman failed to disclose a latent defect.

But in property law, a seller generally doesn't have to disclose hidden defects unless they know about them or there's a duty to inspect. But the woman didn't know about the soil condition. She constructed the drainage system without knowing the soil was pliable.

So, the sister might argue that the woman was negligent in constructing the drainage system without knowing the soil could cause subsidence. Or, she might claim that the woman is liable under some theory of support.

Looking at the options, option F says the sister is entitled to subjacent support. Subjacent support is the natural support from below. If the drainage system undermines that, the owner can sue. But in this case, the sister's land is being damaged because the drainage system (underground) caused the soil to subside. So, perhaps the sister is entitled to subjacent support because the woman's actions (building the system) damaged the natural support.

Alternatively, if the drainage system is on the sister's land, then the woman might have dug into her own land (when she owned C) and thus is liable for lateral support. But the woman no longer owns C, so maybe she's not liable. However, the sister bought the land without knowledge, and the system was already there.

Wait, the sister's land is sinking because of the drainage system. The woman built the system without knowing the soil was unstable. So, if the woman's construction caused the damage, perhaps she's liable for negligence, even if she didn't know about the soil condition.

But the options don't all present that. Option E suggests the woman should have tested the soil, but if she didn't know, maybe she wasn't required to test.

Option I says the sister is entitled to lateral support for her land in its natural condition. Lateral support is about neighboring land, but the sister's land is C, which is the lowest. The woman built the drainage system across all three parcels, including C. So, when the woman was owner of C, she built the system, which now affects the sister's land.

Wait, lateral support is about the support provided by adjacent land. If the woman's land (when she owned C) had a drainage system that caused the sister's land to subside, that might be a lateral support issue. But the sister's land is lower, so perhaps the woman's actions on her own land (C) affected the sister's land.

Alternatively, maybe the sister is claiming that the woman's construction on parcel A caused the subsidence on C, but that seems less likely since A is higher.

Alternatively, the sister's land is parcel C, which is at the bottom. The drainage system goes through all three, so the pipe is under her land. The subsidence is on her land because the pipe is there, and the soil is pliable.

So, the sister is claiming that the woman's drainage system caused her land to subside. The woman didn't know about the soil condition.

In property law, a landowner has a duty to provide lateral support to adjacent land. If the woman was the original owner of C, and she dug into her own land (to build the drainage system), she could be liable for failing to provide lateral support to the adjacent land (which in this case, since C is the lowest, maybe there's no adjacent land below it, but perhaps the land is supported by the earth beneath it, which is subjacent support).

Wait, but the woman no longer owns C. She sold it to her sister. So, the sister now owns C, and the drainage system is part of her land. So, can the sister sue the woman for damage caused by the system that was built when the woman owned C?

I think that the sister is claiming that the woman, when she owned C, failed to provide proper support, causing damage after the transfer. But in property law, the duty to provide lateral support runs with the land, so even after selling, the woman might still be liable if the support was inadequate.

Alternatively, the sister might have a claim for breach of the covenant of seisin or for failing to disclose a defect. But the deed didn't mention the drainage system, so the sister didn't know about it when she bought the property.

In some jurisdictions, a seller must disclose latent defects they know about. But the woman didn't know about the soil condition, so she might not be liable for nondisclosure.

But the woman built the drainage system without knowing the soil was unstable. So, the sister's land is now subsiding because of that. The sister might argue that the woman was negligent in constructing the system without knowing the soil could cause subsidence.

So, looking at the options, option G says the woman wins unless the sister proves she was negligent. So, if the sister can prove negligence, she wins. Otherwise, the woman wins.

Option F says the sister is entitled to subjacent support. Subjacent support is the natural support from below. If the woman's drainage system undermines that, the sister might be entitled to it.

But the sister's land is at the bottom, so maybe the support comes from the ground beneath. If the drainage system caused the ground to subside, that's a failure of subjacent support.

Alternatively, the sister's claim is based on lateral support because the drainage system is under her land, affecting it.

But I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.

The key points:

- Woman built a drainage system across all three parcels, including C, when she owned them all.

- The system drained sewage from A to the municipal sewer at the bottom (C).

- The sister bought C in 2005, deed didn't mention the system.

- The sister's land started subsiding because the soil is pliable, and the woman didn't know.

So, the sister's land is being damaged because the drainage system, built by the woman, is causing the soil to subside.

In property law, when a landowner excavates their land, they must provide lateral support to adjacent land. If they don't, the adjacent land can sue for damages.

In this case, when the woman owned C, she built the drainage system (like digging a tunnel or pipe). This excavation could have affected the sister's land (C). Wait, but C is the parcel she owns now. So, the woman built the system on her own land (C), which is now the sister's. So, the sister's land is being damaged because the woman's construction (while she owned C) caused the subsidence.

But the woman no longer owns C. So, can the sister sue her for damages caused by the construction when the woman owned C?

I think yes, because the duty to provide lateral support can be a continuing duty, and the damage occurred after the sale.

Alternatively, the sister can argue that the woman, as the original excavator, is liable for the damage caused to her land.

So, the sister might have a claim for lateral support. If the woman built the drainage system on her own land (C) without providing proper lateral support, then the sister, as the current owner, can sue.

But the options don't all present that. Let's look at the options again.

Option F: Sister entitled to subjacent support. That would be if the support from below was damaged. The sister's land is at the bottom, so maybe the support comes from below. But the drainage system is on her land, not below it. So, maybe not.

Option I: Sister entitled to lateral support for her land in its natural condition. Lateral support is about adjacent land, but in this case, the sister's land is at the bottom. The woman built the system on her own land, which is now the sister's. So, perhaps the sister is claiming that the woman's construction on her own land (C) caused the land to subside, thus failing to provide lateral support to her own land. That doesn't make sense because lateral support is about neighboring land.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think of it as the woman built a structure (drainage system) on her land (C) which is now the sister's. The structure caused the land to subside because the soil was pliable. The sister is claiming that the woman's structure caused the damage.

In this case, the sister might have a claim against the woman for failing to provide support. But since the woman no longer owns the land, perhaps the sister can't claim lateral support because the adjacent land is not owned by the woman anymore.

Alternatively, the sister might have a claim based on the fact that the woman's construction of the drainage system, while she owned C, caused the damage to the land, which the sister now owns. So, the sister can sue the woman for the damage.

In tort law, the woman could be liable for negligence if she failed to exercise reasonable care. She didn't know about the soil condition, but perhaps she should have known or tested the soil before building the system.

But the options don't directly address negligence. Option E says the sister wins because the woman should have tested the soil. But the woman didn't know about the condition, so she might not have had a duty to test.

Option G says the woman wins unless the sister proves she was negligent. So, if the sister can prove negligence, she can win; otherwise, the woman wins.

Alternatively, the sister might have a claim under the theory of lateral support. The woman, when she owned C, had a duty to provide lateral support to her own land, but if the support was inadequate, the current owner (sister) can sue.

Wait, but lateral support is about support from adjacent land. If the woman's drainage system on her own land (C) caused the land to subside, that's not a failure of lateral support but perhaps a failure to provide adequate support to her own land. But that's more about a covenant of seisin or breach of warranty in a deed.

But the deed didn't mention the drainage system, so the sister might have a claim for breach of the covenant of seisin if the woman knew about the problem. But the woman didn't know, so that's not applicable.

Alternatively, the sister might argue that the woman's construction constitutes a trespass or was done in a negligent manner.

So, going back to the options, option F says the sister is entitled to subjacent support. If the drainage system caused the natural support of the land to fail, then yes. If the subsidence is due to the woman's drainage system, then the sister might be entitled to subjacent support because the support from below was disrupted.

Option I says the sister is entitled to lateral support for her land in its natural condition. But if the sister's land is the lowest, there's no adjacent land below it, so lateral support wouldn't apply. Subjacent support would.

So, I'm leaning towards option F: the sister is entitled to subjacent support because the drainage system caused the natural support to fail.

Alternatively, option I might not apply because lateral support is between adjacent parcels, and C is the lowest.

Wait, but the sister's land is parcel C, and the drainage system is on her land. The woman built it when she owned C, and now the sister owns it. The subsidence is on the sister's land because of the drainage system. So, the sister's land is sinking because the structure (drainage) is on her own land. That might not be a lateral support issue but a failure of support in general.

In that case, the sister's claim would be for subjacent support because the natural support from the ground was disrupted by the drainage system. So, the woman, by building the system, caused the ground to subside, thus damaging the sister's land.

Therefore, the sister would be entitled to subjacent support, making option F correct.

Wait, but the woman didn't know about the soil condition. So, maybe the woman isn't liable because she didn't know. But in property law, the duty to provide support isn't just about knowledge; it's about the act causing the damage.

So, even if the woman didn't know, if her actions (building the drainage system) caused the subsidence, she might be liable unless she can show she wasn't negligent.

Looking at the options, option G says the woman wins unless the sister proves negligence. So, if the sister can show the woman was negligent in constructing the system, she can win. Otherwise, the woman wins.

But the question is, was the woman negligent? She didn't know about the soil condition. Did she have a duty to test the soil? Maybe she should have known that building a drainage system in such soil could cause subsidence, so perhaps she was negligent in not testing.

But the options don't all present that. Option E says the sister wins because the woman should have tested. Option G says the woman wins unless negligence is proven.

So, if the sister can prove negligence, she wins. Otherwise, the woman wins.

But the question is, is the woman negligent for not testing the soil? If it's reasonable to assume that building a drainage system requires testing the soil, then yes. But if the woman had no reason to know the soil was unstable, perhaps she wasn't negligent.

But the question states that the woman was unaware of the soil condition prior to construction. So, she didn't know, and she had no way of knowing. Therefore, she wasn't negligent, and the sister can't prove negligence. So, the woman would win under option G.

Wait, but the sister didn't know about the drainage system when she bought the property. So, she might argue that the woman should have disclosed it, but the deed didn't mention it.

But the woman didn't know about the soil condition, so she didn't know the drainage system would cause subsidence. Therefore, she wasn't obligated to disclose it as a defect.

So, in that case, the woman isn't liable because she wasn't negligent. Therefore, the judgment would be for the woman, unless the sister can prove negligence, which she can't because the woman didn't know.

Therefore, the correct answer would be option G: The woman, unless the sister proves negligence.

But wait, another angle: the woman's duty to provide lateral support. When she owned C, she built the drainage system, which could have been an excavation. If she didn't provide adequate support, the sister can sue for lateral support. But since the woman no longer owns C, is she liable?

In some jurisdictions, the duty to provide lateral support can run with the land, so even after selling, the original owner can be liable if the support fails. So, the sister could sue the woman for failing to provide adequate lateral support.

In that case, the sister would be entitled to lateral support, making option I correct.

But I'm not sure if the woman's own land (C) being affected by her drainage system falls under lateral support. Lateral support is about adjacent land. If the damage is to her own land, perhaps it's a different issue.

Alternatively, the sister's land is parcel C, and the woman's drainage system is on C. The sister's land is sinking because of the drainage system. So, perhaps the sister is entitled to lateral support from the woman, but since the woman no longer owns C, maybe she isn't liable.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to recall the rules.

When a landowner excavates on their land, they must provide lateral support to adjacent land. If they fail to do so, the owner of the adjacent land can sue for damages. The duty to provide lateral support is a continuing duty, so even if the land is sold, the original owner can be liable if the support fails after the sale.

In this case, the woman built the drainage system on her own land (C) when she owned it. Now, the sister owns C, and the drainage system is causing the land to subside. So, the sister can sue the woman for failing to provide adequate lateral support, even though the woman no longer owns C.

Therefore, the sister is entitled to lateral support for her land in its natural condition, making option I correct.

But wait, lateral support is about supporting the land of others. If the woman's land was C, and she built on her own land, perhaps the support is for her own land. But that doesn't make sense. Lateral support is about supporting adjacent land, not your own.

Wait, perhaps the sister's land is being affected by the woman's construction on her own land (C). So, the sister's land is the same as the land where the woman built the drainage system. Therefore, the sister is claiming that the woman's construction on her own land (C) caused damage to her land, which is parcel C.

But that seems like the woman built on her own land, so the sister's claim might be about a covenant of seisin or breach of warranty, not lateral support.

Alternatively, if the drainage system extends under the sister's land, perhaps it's affecting the support from below, which would be subjacent support.

I'm getting more confused. Let me try to outline the possibilities:

1. The sister's claim is based on lateral support: The woman, when she owned C, built a structure that undermined the adjacent land (but C is the lowest, so adjacent would be B and A above). But the subsidence is on C itself, not on B or A.

2. The sister's claim is based on subjacent support: The drainage system disrupted the natural support from below, causing the land to subside.

3. The sister's claim is based on negligence: The woman built the drainage system without knowing the soil was unstable, which caused the damage.

Option F is about subjacent support, option I about lateral support.

If the sister's land is sinking because the drainage system (on her land) is causing the soil to subside, that might be a failure of subjacent support. So, option F would be correct.

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, if the woman built the system on her own land (C) without providing lateral support to herself, that might not apply. Lateral support is for adjacent land, not your own.

Therefore, the sister's claim would be for subjacent support, making option F correct.

But wait, the woman didn't know about the soil condition, so she didn't intentionally cause harm. However, the duty to provide support isn't about intent; it's about the duty to not cause damage.

So, the sister is entitled to subjacent support because the woman's drainage system disrupted the natural support. Therefore, option F is correct.

Alternatively, if the sister's land is being damaged because the woman's drainage system on her own land (C) caused the subsidence, the sister might have a claim for lateral support because the woman, as the original owner, had a duty to provide support even after selling the land.

But I'm still not entirely certain. Another approach: look at the options and see which ones make sense.

Option F: Sister entitled to subjacent support. That would mean the sister can recover because the support from below was damaged.

Option I: Sister entitled to lateral support for her land in its natural condition. That would mean the woman didn't provide support from the side, but in this case, the sister's land is the lowest, so there's no adjacent land below.

Therefore, the correct answer is likely option F: the sister is entitled to subjacent support.

But wait, another thought: the sister's land is being damaged because the woman's drainage system is under her land. So, the sister's land is sinking because the woman's structure is causing the ground to subside. That sounds like a failure of support, but it's the same land. So, maybe it's not lateral support but a failure of the woman to construct the drainage system properly.

Alternatively, the sister might have a claim in tort for negligence, but the options don't directly address that.

Given the options, I think the best choice is option F: the sister is entitled to subjacent support.

Wait, but another angle: the sister's land is in its natural condition except for the home. The subsidence is causing damage, so she's entitled to lateral support because the woman's construction on her own land (C) affected the support. But I'm not sure if that's lateral support.

I think I'm overcomplicating it. The key is that the sister's land is subsiding because of the drainage system built by the woman. The woman didn't know about the soil condition. So, the sister's claim is for support.

The sister's land is at the bottom, so the support comes from below (subjacent). The drainage system disrupted that support, so she's entitled to subjacent support. Therefore, option F is correct.

Alternatively, if the woman built the system on her own land (C), and the sister's land is the same as C, then the sister can't claim lateral support because there's no adjacent land. So, it's subjacent support.

Therefore, the answer should be option F.
</think>

The scenario involves a woman who owned three parcels of land (A, B, and C) and constructed a drainage system across all three parcels in 2000. Parcel C, the lowest property, was later sold to her sister in 2005, with the deed not mentioning the drainage system. After the sale, the sister's parcel C began to subside due to the drainage system, which was built on pliable soil unknown to the woman. The sister sued for property damage, claiming the woman's drainage system caused the subsidence.

Key legal principles include the duty to provide lateral support (support from adjacent land) and subjacent support (natural support from below). The woman built the drainage system on parcel C when she owned it, and the subsidence occurred after she sold the parcel to her sister. The sister did not know about the drainage system at the time of purchase.

The sister's claim likely hinges on whether the woman's actions disrupted the natural support of the land, making her entitled to subjacent support. The woman did not know about the soil condition, so she cannot be held liable for intentionally hiding a defect. However, the duty to provide support is not dependent on intent but on the act causing the damage. The drainage system, built by the woman, disrupted the natural support of the land, entitling the sister to subjacent support.

Option F states that the sister is entitled to subjacent support for her land in its natural condition. This aligns with the facts, as the subsidence was caused by the drainage system affecting the natural support of the land. Other options, such as lateral support (option I), are less applicable because the sister's land is the lowest parcel, and lateral support typically refers to support from adjacent land, not the land itself.

Thus, the judgment should be for the sister, as she is entitled to subjacent support for her land in its natural condition.

**Answer: F**
