Okay, so I have this question about Piaget's theory of cognitive development, and I need to match the concepts with the correct stages. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that Piaget divided cognitive development into four stages: sensorimotor, preoperational, concrete operational, and formal operational. Each stage has its own main characteristics.

The options given are A to J, each pairing a concept with a stage. I need to figure out which pair is correct.

Let me list out the concepts and the stages they belong to as I remember them.

1. Centration: I think centration is about focusing on one aspect of a problem and ignoring others. I recall that this is part of the preoperational stage. So, maybe it's not in the sensorimotor stage.

2. Conservation: Conservation is the understanding that quantity remains the same even if the shape changes. Piaget said kids learn this in the concrete operational stage. So, if an option pairs conservation with formal operational, that might be wrong.

3. Object permanence: That's the understanding that objects continue to exist even when they can't be seen. I believe this is learned in the sensorimotor stage, specifically around 8 months old. So, if an option says object permanence is in the concrete operational stage, that would be incorrect.

4. Egocentrism: This is when a child can't see things from others' perspectives. I think this is part of the preoperational stage, not the formal operational. So if an option pairs egocentrism with formal operational, that's wrong.

5. Hypothetical-deductive reasoning: This involves using hypotheses to solve problems. Piaget said this develops in the formal operational stage, so that concept should be matched with formal operational.

Now, looking at the options:

A: Centration—sensorimotor. Hmm, I thought centration is preoperational, so A might be wrong.

B: Conservation—sensorimotor. No, conservation is concrete operational, so B is incorrect.

C: Object permanence—concrete operational. Wait, object permanence is sensorimotor, so C is wrong.

D: Egocentrism—formal operational. No, egocentrism is preoperational, so D is incorrect.

E: Egocentrism—sensorimotor. No, sensorimotor is before preoperational, so E is wrong.

F: Object permanence—preoperational. No, object permanence is sensorimotor, so F is incorrect.

G: Conservation—formal operational. No, conservation is concrete operational, so G is wrong.

H: Hypothetical-deductive reasoning—formal operational. Yes, this matches what I remember, so H seems correct.

I: Hypothetical-deductive reasoning—preoperational. No, that's not right, so I is wrong.

J: Centration—concrete operational. Wait, centration is preoperational, so J is incorrect.

Wait, did I get centration right? Centration is about focusing on one aspect. I think it's part of the preoperational stage, which comes after sensorimotor. So looking back at the options, J says centration—concrete operational. But I thought centration is preoperational, so J would be wrong. The correct pairing for centration would be preoperational, but none of the options have that except perhaps A or J. Wait, A is sensorimotor, which is wrong. So maybe none of the options have the correct centration pairing except perhaps J is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me double-check.

Piaget's stages:

- Sensorimotor (0-2): Object permanence, begins around 8 months.
- Preoperational (2-7): Egocentrism, Centration.
- Concrete Operational (7-11): Conservation, reversibility.
- Formal Operational (11+): Hypothetical-deductive reasoning.

So:

Centration is preoperational, so any option pairing it with sensorimotor (A) or concrete (J) is wrong. So A and J are incorrect.

Conservation is concrete operational, so options B and G are wrong.

Object permanence is sensorimotor, so C and F are wrong.

Egocentrism is preoperational, so D and E are wrong.

Hypothetical-deductive reasoning is formal operational, so H is correct.

So the correct answer is H: Hypothetical-deductive reasoning—formal operational stage.

The correct answer is H: Hypothetical-deductive reasoning—formal operational stage.
