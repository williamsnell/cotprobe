Answer:
    
<think>
Okay, so I've got this biology question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question says that if DNAse is added to a bacterial cell, the DNA is hydrolyzed. That makes sense because DNAse is an enzyme that breaks down DNA. When the DNA is broken down, the cell can't make proteins anymore because it needs DNA to transcribe into mRNA and then translate into proteins. So the cell dies.

But then, when DNAse is added while certain viruses are in the cell, the cells continue to produce new proteins. That's interesting. Why would that happen? So the virus must have some way of allowing the cell to keep making proteins even after DNAse is added.

Let me think about what DNAse does. It breaks down DNA. So if the cells are still making proteins, their DNA must not be affected. But wait, the bacterial cell's DNA would be degraded by DNAse, so how is the cell still making proteins? Maybe the virus is somehow protecting its own DNA or the host's DNA isn't needed anymore for some reason.

Wait, no. The question says that when DNAse is added to the bacterial cell without the virus, the DNA is hydrolyzed, and the cell dies. But when the virus is present, the cells continue to produce proteins. So the presence of the virus somehow allows the cell to keep functioning despite DNAse.

Hmm, possible scenarios: maybe the virus's DNA is protected in some way. Or the virus has integrated into the host's genome, so the host's DNA isn't being used anymore, but the virus's DNA is replicated separately, not affected by DNAse.

Wait, but DNAse would break down any DNA in the cell. Unless the DNAse isn't targeting the virus's DNA. Let me look at the options.

Option A: The virus contains RNA because it's not affected by DNAse. That makes sense because DNAse targets DNA, not RNA. So if the virus uses RNA, then DNAse wouldn't affect it. But wait, the question says that when the virus is present, the cell continues to make proteins. So maybe the virus provides its own RNA, which is used for translation into proteins. But wait, the bacterial cell's own DNA is being broken down by DNAse, so how is it making proteins? Unless the virus is providing the mRNA.

Wait, maybe the virus has integrated its DNA into the host's chromosome. So when DNAse is added, it would break down the host's DNA, including the viral DNA. But that doesn't make sense because the host's DNA is being broken down, so the cell can't produce proteins. Unless the virus has some way of preventing that.

Alternatively, maybe the virus's DNA isn't in the nucleus anymore. For example, if the virus is in the cytoplasm, and DNAse can't reach it because it's in the nucleus. Wait, but bacteria don't have a nucleus; their DNA is in the cytoplasm. So that might not apply.

Looking at the options again:

Option B: The virus integrates its DNA into the host's chromosome, which is not targeted by DNAse. Wait, but DNAse would target the host's DNA, including the integrated viral DNA. So if the host's DNA is broken down, the cell can't make proteins. But the question says the cell continues to produce proteins when the virus is present. So maybe the virus's DNA is integrated, and the host's enzymes are being used to make viral proteins. But the host's DNA is broken, so they can't make their own proteins. Hmm, this doesn't add up.

Option C: The cell repairs DNAse damage quickly, which the virus uses. I don't know much about this. Maybe the virus helps the cell repair DNA, but I'm not sure if that's the case here.

Option D: The virus uses the host's DNA replication machinery, which isn't susceptible to DNAse. That doesn't make sense because DNAse would break down the host's DNA, and the replication machinery would be affected too.

Option E: The virus is unaffected by DNAse because it's immune. Not sure what that means. Maybe it's resistant, but I don't think that's the case.

Option F: The virus contains DNA. Well, that's true for many viruses, but how does that help? If the virus's DNA is present, DNAse would break it down too, unless it's somehow protected.

Option G: The virus has a protective protein coat preventing DNAse from reaching its DNA. That could be possible. So the DNAse can't access the viral DNA because it's coated in proteins. But then why would the host cell continue to make proteins? Because the host's DNA is being broken down. Hmm, maybe the virus provides the mRNA for the proteins instead.

Option H: The virus is resistant to DNAse. That might mean that the virus's DNA isn't affected, but the host's DNA is still broken, so the cell can't make its own proteins. So why would the cell continue to produce proteins? Unless the virus provides the necessary components.

Option I: The virus replicates in the cell's nucleus where DNAse can't reach. But bacteria don't have a nucleus. So this option is probably incorrect.

Wait, let me think again. When DNAse is added to a bacterial cell without the virus, the cell's DNA is broken, so it can't transcribe mRNA, thus no proteins, and the cell dies.

When the virus is present, the cell continues to make proteins. So the cell must have a way to produce mRNA despite the DNA being broken. How? Maybe the virus provides its own mRNA, which the host's ribosomes translate into proteins. But how does the virus get its mRNA into the host without its DNA being broken?

Alternatively, the virus might have integrated its DNA into the host's genome. So the host's DNA is still present, but the virus's DNA is part of it. Wait, but DNAse would break down the host's DNA, including the viral part. So that doesn't explain why the cell can still make proteins.

Wait, maybe the virus is an RNA virus. If the virus has RNA instead of DNA, then DNAse wouldn't affect it. So the virus can use its RNA to make proteins. So the host's DNA is broken, but the virus's RNA is intact, and the cell uses it to make viral proteins. But the question says the cell continues to produce new proteins, which I assume are their own. Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, the question says "the cells continue to produce new proteins." So perhaps the cell's own proteins are still being made. But if the DNA is broken by DNAse, the cell can't transcribe its own genes. So the only way the cell can make proteins is if it has mRNA available, which would have to come from the virus.

So if the virus provides the mRNA, then the cell can make proteins. But how does the virus provide mRNA without its DNA being broken?

Another angle: Maybe the virus uses a different mechanism for replication that doesn't involve the host's DNA. For example, some viruses can replicate without integrating into the host's genome, perhaps using their own enzymes. But I'm not sure.

Wait, let's go back to the options. Option A says the virus contains RNA. That would mean the virus is an RNA virus. So DNAse wouldn't affect the virus's genome because it's RNA. So the virus can continue to produce its own mRNA and the host's ribosomes can make proteins from that mRNA. But the host's DNA is broken, so the cell can't make its own proteins. But the question says the cells continue to produce new proteins, which I'm assuming are their own. So maybe that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps the question is implying that the cell's DNA is being broken, but the virus's DNA is somehow protected. So the cell's DNA is gone, but the virus's DNA remains, allowing the virus to produce proteins using the host's machinery.

Wait, but DNAse would break down all DNA in the cell, including the virus's. Unless the virus's DNA is protected.

Looking at the options, option G says the virus has a protective protein coat that prevents DNAse from reaching its DNA. That would mean the virus's DNA isn't broken down, so it can use it to produce proteins. But then, the host's DNA is broken, so the cell can't make its own proteins. So why would the cell continue to produce proteins? Unless the virus's DNA is providing the necessary mRNA.

Alternatively, maybe the virus has a way to make proteins without relying on the host's DNA. For example, if the virus brings its own ribosomes or something, but that's not likely.

Wait, perhaps the virus is a DNA virus that has integrated into the host's genome, so the host's DNA is now a mix of host and viral DNA. When DNAse is added, it breaks down the host's DNA, including the viral part. But then the cell can't make any proteins. So that doesn't explain why the cell continues to produce proteins.

Another thought: Maybe the virus is a temperate phage that integrates its DNA into the host's genome. When DNAse is added, it would break the host's DNA, including the viral DNA. But then the cell can't make proteins, so that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe the virus is using a different strategy, like replicating without integrating into the host's DNA. So the virus's DNA is separate, but protected. So DNAse can't reach it because of a protein coat. Then, the virus can use its own DNA to produce mRNA, which the host's ribosomes translate into viral proteins. But the host's own DNA is broken, so the host can't make its own proteins. But the question says the cell continues to produce proteins, which I'm assuming are for the cell's own use, not viral. So that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the virus is a lysogenic phage. When it integrates into the host's genome, it becomes a prophage. So the host's DNA now includes the viral genes. When DNAse is added, it would break down the host's DNA, including the viral genes. But then the host can't make any proteins, including its own. So the cell would die. But the question says the cell continues to produce proteins when the virus is present. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, maybe the virus is an RNA virus. So DNAse doesn't affect it. The cell's DNA is broken, but the virus's RNA is intact. So the cell uses the virus's RNA to make proteins. But the cell's own proteins would stop being made because their DNA is gone. So the cell would produce viral proteins, but not its own. But the question says the cells continue to produce new proteins, which I think refers to their own. So maybe that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps the virus provides a way for the cell to replicate its DNA without using the host's replication machinery. But I'm not sure.

Let me look at the options again. Option B says the virus integrates its DNA into the host's chromosome, which is not targeted by DNAse. Wait, but DNAse targets DNA. If the virus's DNA is integrated into the host's chromosome, then DNAse would break it down along with the host's DNA. So that wouldn't protect it. So option B might not be correct.

Option I: The virus replicates in the cell's nucleus where DNAse can't reach. But bacteria don't have a nucleus, so this option is probably wrong.

Option G: The virus has a protective protein coat that prevents DNAse from reaching its DNA. So the virus's DNA isn't broken, but the host's DNA is. So the virus can use its DNA to make mRNA, which the host's ribosomes translate into proteins. But the host's own DNA is broken, so they can't make their own proteins. But the question says the cells continue to produce new proteins, which I'm assuming are their own. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe the question is implying that the cell's DNA isn't being broken because the virus is somehow protecting it. But why would the virus protect the host's DNA? That doesn't make sense from an evolutionary standpoint.

Another angle: Maybe the virus is using a different pathway for protein synthesis that doesn't rely on the host's DNA. For example, some viruses bring their own RNA and enzymes to replicate. But I'm not sure.

Wait, the question says that when DNAse is added, the DNA is hydrolyzed. So the host's DNA is broken, but the virus's DNA isn't. How? Maybe the virus's DNA is in a part of the cell that DNAse can't reach, like the cell membrane or some structure. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the virus is using a different type of DNA that DNAse can't break down. But I don't think that's the case.

Wait, let's think about what DNAse does. It's an enzyme that breaks down DNA by cleaving the phosphodiester bonds. So if the DNA is protected, like in a protein coat, the enzyme can't access it. So option G says the virus has a protective protein coat. That would prevent DNAse from reaching the viral DNA. So the virus's DNA remains intact, and it can use it to make mRNA, which the host's ribosomes translate into proteins. But the host's own DNA is broken, so they can't make their own proteins. However, the question says the cells continue to produce new proteins, which might mean the cell's own proteins, not viral ones. So this doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the virus is a plasmid that's circular. Circular DNA is more resistant to some enzymes, but I don't think DNAse is affected by that.

Alternatively, maybe the virus's DNA is in a different form, like single-stranded, which might be more resistant. But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the virus is using the host's RNA as a template. But that would require the virus to have RNA polymerase, which I'm not sure about.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to eliminate options.

Option E: The virus is unaffected by DNAse because it's immune. I don't think that's a standard biological mechanism.

Option F: The virus contains DNA. Well, that's true for many viruses, but how does that help? The host's DNA is broken, so the cell can't make its own proteins. Unless the virus provides the necessary mRNA.

Option A: The virus contains RNA. So it's an RNA virus. Then DNAse wouldn't affect the virus's genome. So the virus can replicate using its RNA. But the host's DNA is broken, so the host can't make its own proteins. But the question says the cell continues to produce proteins, which I think refers to the cell's own proteins. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe the cell's DNA is not completely broken because the virus is preventing it. But that seems unlikely.

Another thought: Maybe the virus is using the host's DNA replication machinery, which isn't affected by DNAse. But that doesn't make sense because DNAse would break the host's DNA.

Option D: The virus uses the host's DNA replication machinery, which isn't susceptible to DNAse. No, that's not correct. The replication machinery is made of proteins, not DNA, but the DNA itself is being broken by DNAse.

Wait, maybe the virus is replicating in a part of the cell where DNAse can't reach. But bacteria don't have such compartments.

Wait, perhaps the virus's DNA is in the form of a virion with a protein coat, so DNAse can't reach it. So the virus's DNA remains intact, allowing it to produce mRNA, which the host's ribosomes use to make viral proteins. But the host's own DNA is broken, so they can't make their own proteins. But the question says the cells continue to produce new proteins, which I'm assuming are their own. So this doesn't fit.

Hmm, maybe the question is implying that the virus is using the host's DNA replication machinery, and since the machinery isn't affected by DNAse, it can continue to make proteins. But I'm not sure.

Wait, the question says that the cells continue to produce new proteins when the virus is present. So the cell's own DNA is gone, but the virus's DNA is intact. So the virus's DNA is providing the necessary mRNA for the cell to make proteins. But why would the cell make proteins from the virus's DNA? Because the virus is using the host's machinery to replicate.

So the virus's DNA isn't broken by DNAse because it's protected. So the correct option would be G: the virus has a protective protein coat.

But wait, the virus's DNA is inside a protein coat, so DNAse can't reach it. The host's DNA is broken, so the cell can't make its own proteins, but the virus's DNA is intact, so it can make viral proteins. But the question says the cells continue to produce new proteins, which I'm assuming are their own. So this doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe the virus's DNA is integrated into the host's genome in such a way that it's not accessible to DNAse. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the virus is not using DNA at all. So it's an RNA virus. Then DNAse wouldn't affect it. So the virus's RNA is used to make proteins. But the host's DNA is broken, so the host can't make its own proteins. But the question says the cells continue to produce proteins, which I think refers to their own. So this doesn't fit.

I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the options again.

Option B says the virus integrates its DNA into the host's chromosome, which is not targeted by DNAse. Wait, no, DNAse targets DNA regardless of where it is. So if the virus's DNA is integrated into the host's chromosome, DNAse would break it down along with the host's DNA. So the cell's DNA is gone, and the virus's DNA is gone too. So the cell can't make any proteins, which contradicts the question.

Option I: The virus replicates in the nucleus where DNAse can't reach. But bacteria don't have a nucleus, so this is incorrect.

Option C: The cell repairs DNAse-induced damage rapidly, which the virus exploits. I'm not familiar with this mechanism, but perhaps the virus provides factors that help the cell repair DNA quickly. But I'm not sure how that would allow the cell to continue producing proteins.

Option H: The virus is resistant to DNAse. So its DNA isn't broken. But how does that help the cell produce proteins? The host's DNA is broken, so the cell can't make its own proteins. Unless the virus provides the mRNA.

Wait, perhaps the virus's DNA is protected, so it can produce mRNA for the cell's own proteins. But that doesn't make sense because the virus would likely produce its own proteins, not the host's.

I'm a bit confused. Let me try to approach this differently. The key point is that when DNAse is added, the bacterial cell's DNA is broken, so it can't make proteins and dies. But when a certain virus is present, the cell continues to make proteins. So the presence of the virus somehow allows the cell to keep producing proteins despite DNAse.

Possible scenarios:

1. The virus's DNA is protected from DNAse, so it can produce mRNA that the cell uses to make proteins. But the cell's own DNA is broken, so the cell can't make its own proteins. But the question says the cells continue to produce new proteins, which I'm assuming are their own. So this doesn't fit.

2. The virus provides a way for the cell to replicate its DNA without using the host's replication machinery. But I'm not sure.

3. The virus is an RNA virus, so DNAse doesn't affect it. The virus can use its RNA to make proteins. But again, the cell's own DNA is broken, so the cell can't make its own proteins.

Wait, perhaps the virus is a plasmid that's circular and more resistant to DNAse. But I don't think that's the case.

Another thought: Maybe the virus is using reverse transcriptase to make DNA from its RNA, but that would require the virus to have RNA. But then DNAse would break that DNA.

Alternatively, the virus might have a way to repair DNA quickly, but I don't know.

Wait, perhaps the virus is a lysogenic phage that, upon integration, doesn't disrupt the host's DNA. So DNAse would break the host's DNA, but the viral DNA is somehow protected. But I'm not sure.

I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let's look at the options again.

Option A: The virus contains RNA. So it's an RNA virus. Then DNAse doesn't affect it. The virus can use its RNA to make proteins. But the host's DNA is broken, so the host can't make its own proteins. But the question says the cells continue to produce new proteins, which I'm assuming are their own. So this doesn't fit.

Option B: The virus integrates into the host's chromosome. But DNAse would break both, so the cell can't make proteins. So this doesn't fit.

Option G: The virus has a protective coat. So its DNA isn't broken. The virus can use its DNA to make mRNA, which the host translates into proteins. But the host's DNA is broken, so they can't make their own. So the cell would make viral proteins, but the question says the cells continue to produce proteins, which I think are their own. So this doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe the question is implying that the virus's presence allows the host's DNA to not be targeted by DNAse. How? Maybe the virus's DNA is not recognized as foreign, so DNAse doesn't target it. But DNAse targets any DNA, regardless of origin.

Another angle: Maybe the virus is a DNA virus that doesn't require the host's DNA for replication. For example, it has its own enzymes. But then the host's DNA is broken, so the cell can't make proteins.

I'm stuck. Let me try to think about what each option implies.

Option B says the virus integrates into the host's chromosome, which is not targeted by DNAse. But DNAse targets DNA, so that doesn't make sense.

Option G: The virus has a protective coat. So the virus's DNA isn't broken. The virus can then use its DNA to make mRNA, which the host's ribosomes translate into proteins. But the host's DNA is broken, so they can't make their own proteins. So the cell would produce viral proteins, but the question says the cell continues to produce new proteins, which I'm assuming are their own.

Wait, maybe the virus's DNA is providing the necessary genes for the cell to continue producing proteins. For example, the virus integrates its DNA in such a way that it supplies the necessary genes. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the virus is a plasmid that's providing essential genes. But plasmids are circular DNA, and DNAse would break them too.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the virus is a bacteriophage that, upon infection, injects its DNA into the host. If the virus's DNA is protected (like in a capsid), DNAse can't reach it. So the virus's DNA remains intact. The host's DNA is broken, so the host can't make its own proteins, but the virus can use its DNA to make mRNA and produce viral proteins. But the question says the cell continues to produce new proteins, which I'm assuming are the host's, not the virus's.

I'm not getting this. Maybe I need to think about what each option is suggesting.

Option A: Virus has RNA. So DNAse doesn't affect it. The virus can replicate using its RNA, making proteins. But the host's DNA is broken, so the host can't make its own proteins.

Option B: Virus integrates into host's DNA, which isn't targeted by DNAse. No, DNAse targets DNA.

Option C: Cell repairs DNAse damage quickly, exploiting the virus. Not sure.

Option D: Virus uses host's DNA replication machinery, which isn't susceptible. No, DNAse affects the DNA.

Option E: Virus is immune to DNAse. Unlikely.

Option F: Virus has DNA. True, but how does that help?

Option G: Virus has protective coat. So its DNA isn't broken. So it can make mRNA for proteins, but host can't.

Option H: Virus is resistant to DNAse. Same as G.

Option I: Virus replicates in nucleus where DNAse can't reach. Bacteria don't have nucleus.

So the only options that make sense are A and G. If the virus is an RNA virus (A), then DNAse doesn't affect it. But the host's DNA is broken, so the host can't make its own proteins. But the question says the cells continue to produce proteins, which I think are their own. So that doesn't fit.

If the virus has a protective coat (G), then its DNA isn't broken. So it can make mRNA for proteins, but again, the host's proteins stop. So the cell would make viral proteins, but the question says the cells continue to produce new proteins, implying their own.

Wait, maybe the virus's presence allows the host's DNA to not be broken. How? If the virus's DNA is integrated in a way that DNAse doesn't affect it, but the host's DNA is still broken. That doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, maybe the virus is using a different pathway for replication that doesn't involve the host's DNA. But then the host's DNA is broken, so the cell can't make proteins.

I'm stuck. Maybe the correct answer is option B, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: When the virus is present, the host's DNA is not being used because the virus's DNA is providing the necessary genes. So the host's DNA is irrelevant. But how?

If the virus integrates into the host's chromosome (option B), then the host's DNA is still there, but the virus's DNA is part of it. When DNAse is added, it breaks the host's DNA, including the virus's DNA. So the cell can't make any proteins, which contradicts the question.

Hmm. Maybe the virus's DNA is in a separate location, like a plasmid, that's not broken by DNAse. But plasmids are circular DNA, and DNAse can still break them.

Wait, another thought: The virus might be using the host's RNA as a template. So it's an RNA virus, and DNAse doesn't affect it. The virus can replicate using the host's RNA, making proteins. But the host's DNA is broken, so the host can't make its own proteins.

I'm going in circles. Let me think about the options again.

The question is why the cells continue to produce proteins when the virus is present. So the cell's DNA must still be intact or the virus provides a way for the cell to make proteins without using its DNA.

If the virus is an RNA virus (option A), then DNAse doesn't break its genome. The virus can use its RNA to produce mRNA, which the cell translates into proteins. But the host's DNA is broken, so the cell can't make its own proteins. But the question says the cells continue to produce proteins, which I'm assuming are their own. So this doesn't fit.

If the virus's DNA is protected (option G), then the virus can use its DNA to make mRNA, leading to viral proteins. But again, the host's DNA is broken, so the cell can't make its own proteins.

Wait, maybe the question is implying that the virus's presence allows the host's DNA to not be broken. How? Maybe the virus's DNA is not recognized as DNA by the cell, so DNAse doesn't target it. But that's not how DNAse works.

Another possibility: The virus uses a different type of DNA that DNAse can't break. For example, it's a single-stranded DNA. But I don't think that's the case.

I'm really stuck here. Maybe the correct answer is option B: the virus integrates its DNA into the host's chromosome, which isn't targeted by DNAse. But that doesn't make sense because DNAse targets DNA regardless of where it is.

Wait, perhaps the virus's DNA is in a different location that DNAse can't reach. For example, the cell wall or some structure. But I don't know.

Alternatively, maybe the virus is using a different method of replication that doesn't involve the host's DNA. But then the host's DNA is broken, so the cell can't make its own proteins.

I think I need to make a choice. Based on the options, the most plausible is option B: the virus integrates its DNA into the host's chromosome, which is not targeted by DNAse. But that doesn't make sense because DNAse would target the host's DNA, including the virus's. So maybe that's not correct.

Wait, perhaps the virus is a temperate phage that, upon integration, doesn't disrupt the host's DNA. So when DNAse is added, it breaks the host's DNA, but the virus's DNA is somehow protected. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the virus is a plasmid that's circular and more resistant. But I don't think that's the case.

I think I've exhausted all options. Based on the given choices, the best answer seems to be option B: the virus integrates its DNA into the host's chromosome, which is not targeted by DNAse. But I'm not confident. Alternatively, option G might be correct if the virus's DNA is protected.

Wait, the question says that the cells continue to produce new proteins. So the cell's DNA must still be intact or the virus provides the means. If the virus's DNA is protected, then it can provide the necessary genes for the cell to make proteins. But the host's DNA is broken, so the cell can't make its own proteins unless the virus provides the mRNA.

I'm going to go with option B: the virus integrates its DNA into the host's chromosome, which is not targeted by DNAse. But I'm not entirely sure.
</think>

The question involves understanding why bacterial cells continue to produce proteins when certain viruses are present, despite the addition of DNAse, which hydrolyzes DNA. DNAse breaks down DNA, preventing the cell from producing proteins and leading to cell death. However, when a specific virus is present, the cells can still produce proteins, suggesting the virus has a mechanism to either protect its DNA or provide an alternative pathway for protein synthesis.

### Key Analysis of Options:

1. **Option A**: The virus contains RNA.  
   - If the virus is an RNA virus, DNAse would not affect its genome. However, the host's DNA is broken, so the cell cannot produce its own proteins. This does not explain why the cell continues to produce proteins, which are likely its own, not viral.  

2. **Option B**: The virus integrates its DNA into the host's chromosome, which is not targeted by DNAse.  
   - If the virus integrates its DNA into the host's chromosome, DNAse would still target and break both the host's and the virus's DNA. This would prevent the cell from producing any proteins, contradicting the question.  

3. **Option C**: The cell repairs DNAse-induced damage rapidly, which the virus exploits.  
   - There is no clear evidence or mechanism provided to suggest that the virus facilitates rapid DNA repair in the host cell. This option is speculative and unlikely.  

4. **Option D**: The virus uses the host's DNA replication machinery, which is not susceptible to DNAse.  
   - DNAse targets DNA, not the replication machinery. If the host's DNA is broken, the cell cannot produce proteins, making this option implausible.  

5. **Option E**: The virus is unaffected by DNAse because it's immune.  
   - This is not a standard biological mechanism. Viruses are not immune to enzymes like DNAse; protection would likely come from a structural feature, not immunity.  

6. **Option F**: The virus contains DNA.  
   - While many viruses do contain DNA, this alone does not explain why the cell continues to produce proteins. The host's DNA is still broken, so the cell cannot produce its own proteins unless the virus provides an alternative mechanism.  

7. **Option G**: The virus has a protective protein coat that prevents DNAse from reaching its DNA.  
   - If the virus's DNA is protected by a protein coat, it could remain intact and potentially provide the necessary genetic material for protein synthesis. However, the host's DNA is still broken, so the cell cannot produce its own proteins, making this option inconsistent with the question.  

8. **Option H**: The virus is resistant to DNAse.  
   - Similar to Option G, this would protect the virus's DNA but does not explain how the host cell continues to produce its own proteins.  

9. **Option I**: The virus replicates in the cell's nucleus where DNAse cannot reach.  
   - Bacteria do not have a nucleus, making this option irrelevant.  

### Conclusion:
The most plausible explanation, despite its flaws, is that the virus integrates its DNA into the host's chromosome (Option B). This assumes that the virus's DNA is somehow protected or that the integration process allows the virus to manipulate the host's DNA in a way that enables continued protein production. While this explanation is not entirely consistent with the described mechanism of DNAse, it aligns most closely with the given options.

**Answer: B**
