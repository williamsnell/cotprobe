Okay, so I have this question about the advantages of multicellular organisms over single-celled ones. I'm a bit rusty on my biology, but let me think through this.

First, I remember that single-celled organisms, like bacteria or protozoa, have only one cell that does everything. Multicellular organisms, like plants, animals, and fungi, have multiple cells. Each cell in a multicellular organism usually has a specific job, right? So that's probably one of the advantages.

Looking at the options, option D says that multicellular organisms have specialized cells for various functions, higher complexity, better adaptation, and diversity. That makes sense because having specialized cells allows them to perform different tasks, like digestion, respiration, reproduction, etc. Without this specialization, they wouldn't be able to do as much. So D seems like a strong candidate.

Option A says multicellular have shorter lifespans, allowing quicker evolutionary adaptations. Hmm, I'm not sure about that. Lifespan varies a lot between species, and I don't think it's a general advantage. Plus, I think longer lifespans might give more time for evolution, but I'm not certain. Maybe not the best answer.

Option B claims they're always larger and have better defense. Wait, no, some single-celled organisms are quite large, like some algae, and size isn't a given. Plus, defense mechanisms vary; being larger might help, but it's not a universal advantage. So B is probably wrong.

Option C says multicellular are less versatile. That doesn't sound right. In fact, multicellular organisms can take on more varied forms and functions because of their specialized cells, so they should be more versatile, making C incorrect.

Option E: reproduce faster. I don't think that's true. Multicellular organisms might have more complex reproduction processes, which could actually be slower. Single-celled organisms like bacteria reproduce quickly through binary fission, so E is likely wrong.

Option F: move more rapidly with better coordination. Well, movement varies a lot. Some multicellular organisms, like cheetahs, can move fast, but others, like trees, don't move at all. So it's not a universal advantage, making F incorrect.

Option G: can synthesize everything from simple nutrients. That sounds more like a capability of some single-celled organisms, like plants via photosynthesis. Multicellular might rely on more complex processes, so G might not be an advantage.

Option H: smaller surface area to volume ratio. Wait, larger organisms have a smaller surface area relative to their volume. A smaller ratio can be a problem for exchanging materials, which is why some organisms have developed other ways, like more efficient diffusion or circulatory systems. So H is probably not a benefit but a challenge.

Option I: don't need to eat food. No, that's not true. Most multicellular organisms do need to consume food. Plants make their own food via photosynthesis, but many animals and fungi still eat. So I is incorrect.

Option J: survive only in water. Definitely not. Multicellular organisms live in many environmentsâ€”land, water, air. So J is wrong.

So, going back, the main advantage is specialization and complexity. So the correct answer should be D.

The correct answer is D: Multicellular organisms have specialized cells for a variety of functions, higher order of complexity, better adaptation to different environments including land, and potential for diversity.

Answer: D
