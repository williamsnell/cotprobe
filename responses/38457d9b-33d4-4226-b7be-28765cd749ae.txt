Question:

Let a undirected graph G with edges E = {<0,1>,<0,2>,<0,3>,<0,5>,<2,3>,<2,4>,<4,5>}, which <A,B> represent Node A is connected to Node B. What is the shortest path from node 0 to node 5? Represent the path as a list.

Options:

A: [0, 1, 3, 5]
B: [0, 2, 5]
C: [0, 3, 5]
D: [0, 2, 3, 5]
E: [0, 1, 2, 5]
F: [0, 3, 2, 5]
G: [0, 1, 5]
H: [0, 5]
I: [0, 1, 2, 3, 5]
J: [0, 2, 4, 5]

Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the shortest path from node 0 to node 5 in an undirected graph. The edges are given as E = {<0,1>, <0,2>, <0,3>, <0,5>, <2,3>, <2,4>, <4,5>}. Hmm, let me try to visualize the graph first.

Starting with node 0, it's connected directly to nodes 1, 2, 3, and 5. So the edges from 0 are 0-1, 0-2, 0-3, and 0-5. Wait, so 0 is connected to 5 directly. That means the shortest path from 0 to 5 is just 0 →5, right? Because that's a direct edge. So that would be the shortest possible path with just one step.

But wait, let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Let me look at the options provided. Option H is [0,5], which is a path of length 1. Are there any other options that have a shorter path? Well, the path can't be shorter than one edge because you can't get from 0 to 5 in zero steps. So that's the shortest possible.

But just to double-check, maybe I should consider if there are alternative paths that could be shorter than the direct connection. For example, is there a path like 0→2→4→5? That would be three steps, which is longer than the direct path. Similarly, 0→2→3→5 is another option, but again, longer. Or 0→3→2→5, which is also three steps. All of these are longer than the direct edge.

Wait, but what about the other options? Let's go through each option:

A: [0,1,3,5] → length 3
B: [0,2,5] → length 2
C: [0,3,5] → length 2
D: [0,2,3,5] → length 3
E: [0,1,2,5] → length 3
F: [0,3,2,5] → length 3
G: [0,1,5] → Hmm, is there an edge 1-5? Looking back, the edges are 0-1,0-2,0-3,0-5,2-3,2-4,4-5. So 1 isn't connected to 5 directly. So option G isn't a valid path because 1 and 5 aren't connected. So G is incorrect.

H: [0,5] → length 1
I: [0,1,2,3,5] → length 4
J: [0,2,4,5] → length 3

So H is the shortest, but wait, the question is about the shortest path, so the one with the fewest edges. H is just one edge, so that's the shortest possible.

I think I might have overcomplicated it, but yes, the direct edge from 0 to 5 makes the path length 1, which is the shortest possible. So the correct answer should be option H.

The shortest path from node 0 to node 5 is directly connected via edge <0,5>, making the path [0,5].

Answer: H
