Okay, so I need to figure out which nitrogenous compound is the main one in urine. Let me think about what I know. Urine is a waste product from the kidneys, right? It's got various substances that the body doesn't need. The main nitrogenous compounds I can think of are urea, ammonia, uric acid, and maybe creatinine. 

Wait, I remember that when proteins are broken down in the body, the nitrogen is released. The liver processes this nitrogen and forms urea. Then the urea is transported to the kidneys and excreted in urine. So urea must be a major component.

But wait, what about ammonia? I think ammonia is also a nitrogenous waste, but isn't it more toxic? So the body converts it to urea to make it less harmful. That would mean urea is the main one because it's less toxic and can be transported more safely.

Creatinine is another one. I know it's a byproduct of muscle metabolism and is also excreted in urine, but I think it's more about muscle function and kidney function assessment. So maybe it's not the main nitrogenous compound.

Uric acid comes from the breakdown of purines. It's the same compound that forms uric stones if levels are too high. So uric acid is another nitrogenous waste product, but is it the main one in urine? Probably not, since urea is a major one.

Looking at the options, H is urea. So I think H is the correct answer. Other options like A (uric acid) and I (creatinine) are present but not the main ones. Nitrogen itself is a component, but the compounds are more specific. So H: Urea should be the main one.

The main nitrogenous compound in urine is urea, as it is the primary waste product formed from protein metabolism. 

Answer: H
