Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of different number bases. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question has three parts: a), b), and c). Each part involves multiplying two numbers in different bases, and then the options provide results in various bases. I need to figure out which option has all three correct results.

Starting with part a): 3652_8 × 24_8. Both numbers are in octal (base 8). Hmm, I think the easiest way to multiply them is by converting each to decimal first, multiplying, and then converting back to octal. Let me try that.

First, convert 3652_8 to decimal. Breaking it down:
3 * 8^3 = 3 * 512 = 1536
6 * 8^2 = 6 * 64 = 384
5 * 8^1 = 5 * 8 = 40
2 * 8^0 = 2 * 1 = 2
Adding them up: 1536 + 384 = 1920, 1920 +40=1960, 1960+2=1962. So 3652_8 is 1962 in decimal.

Next, 24_8 to decimal:
2*8^1 +4*8^0 = 16 +4 =20.

Multiplying 1962 * 20 = 39240.

Now, convert 39240 back to octal. To do that, I'll divide by 8 repeatedly and find the remainders.

39240 ÷8 = 4905, remainder 0
4905 ÷8 = 613, rem 1
613 ÷8 =76, rem 5
76 ÷8=9, rem 4
9 ÷8=1, rem 1
1 ÷8=0, rem 1
Reading the remainders from bottom up: 1 1 4 5 1 0. So 39240 decimal is 114510_8.

Looking at the options, I need to see which option has a) as 114510_8. Let me check the options:

Option H: a) is 114510_8. That's a match. Other options don't have this in a). So possible, but let's check the other parts.

Part b): 11.01_2 × 1.01_2. Both are binary numbers. I think multiplying them in binary would be easier, but I'm not too confident. Alternatively, I can convert to decimal, multiply, and then convert back.

First, 11.01_2 is equal to 1*2^1 + 1*2^0 + 0*2^-1 +1*2^-2 = 2 +1 +0 +0.25=3.25.

1.01_2 is 1*2^0 +0*2^-1 +1*2^-2 = 1 +0 +0.25=1.25.

Multiplying 3.25 *1.25: Let me calculate that. 3*1=3, 3*0.25=0.75, 0.25*1=0.25, 0.25*0.25=0.0625. Adding those: 3 +0.75=3.75, +0.25=4, +0.0625=4.0625.

Now, converting 4.0625 back to binary. Let's handle the integer and fractional parts separately.

Integer part 4: binary is 100.

Fractional part 0.0625: since 0.0625 = 1/16, which is 2^-4. So the fractional part is .0001.

Putting them together: 100.0001_2.

Wait, but looking at the options, the second part (b) is given as something like 110.1100, 101.1101, etc. Hmm, I got 100.0001_2 for the product. Let me see which option has this.

Looking at the options:

Option H: part b is 100.0001_2. Yes, that's exactly what I got. So so far, H is matching for a) and b). Let me check part c).

Part c): 5AB_16 × F5A_16. Both are hexadecimal numbers. Multiplying them directly in hex might be tricky, so I'll convert each to decimal, multiply, and then convert back to hex.

First, 5AB_16. Breaking it down:
5 is the hundreds place (16^2): 5*256=1280
A is 10 in the 16^1 place: 10*16=160
B is 11 in the 16^0 place: 11*1=11
Adding up: 1280 +160=1440, +11=1451.

Next, F5A_16:
F is 15 in the 16^2 place: 15*256=3840
5 is 5 in the 16^1 place:5*16=80
A is 10 in the 16^0 place:10*1=10
Adding: 3840 +80=3920, +10=3930.

Now, multiply 1451 * 3930. Let me compute that.

First, approximate: 1450 * 3930 = Let me compute 1450 * 3930.

Wait, perhaps break it down:

1451 * 3930 = ?

Let me compute 1451 * 3000 = 4,353,000

1451 * 930 = ?

Wait, 3930 = 3000 + 930.

Wait, 930 is 900 +30.

So 1451 * 900 = 1,305,900

1451 *30 =43,530

Adding: 1,305,900 +43,530=1,349,430

Now total is 4,353,000 + 1,349,430 = 5,702,430.

Wait, but let me check that again because I might have made a mistake in the breakdown.

Wait, 3930 is 3000 + 930, but 930 is 900 +30. So 1451*(3000+930) = 1451*3000 + 1451*930.

1451*3000: 1451 *3 =4353, then add three zeros: 4,353,000.

1451*930: Let's compute 1451 *900 = 1,305,900.

1451*30=43,530.

So 1,305,900 +43,530=1,349,430.

Adding to 4,353,000: 4,353,000 +1,349,430=5,702,430.

So the product in decimal is 5,702,430.

Now, convert this to hexadecimal.

I'll divide 5,702,430 by 16 repeatedly.

But perhaps a better way is to find how many times 16^6, 16^5, etc., fit into this number.

Compute 16^6 = 16*16*16*16*16*16 = 16^3=4096, so 16^6=4096^2=16,777,216. But 5,702,430 is less than that, so the highest power is 16^5=1,048,576.

Compute how many times 1,048,576 fits into 5,702,430:

5,702,430 ÷ 1,048,576 ≈5.438. So the coefficient is 5.

5 *1,048,576=5,242,880.

Subtract from 5,702,430: 5,702,430 -5,242,880=459,550.

Next, 16^4=65,536.

459,550 ÷65,536 ≈6.999. So 6 times.

6*65,536=393,216.

Subtract:459,550-393,216=66,334.

Next, 16^3=4096.

66,334 ÷4096 ≈16.20, but since we can't have more than 15 in a hex digit, the coefficient is 16? Wait, no, because each digit in hex can only go up to 15 (F). So 16 isn't allowed as a single digit. So perhaps I made a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps I should compute each digit step by step.

Alternatively, perhaps using the division method would be more accurate.

Let me try that.

5,702,430 ÷16.

First step: 5,702,430 ÷16.

16 * 356,401=5,702,416 (because 356,401 *16=5,702,416). The remainder is 5,702,430 -5,702,416=14. So the least significant digit is 14 (E).

Now, take 356,401 ÷16.

356,401 ÷16: 16*22,275=356,400. Remainder 1. Next digit is 1.

Now, 22,275 ÷16: 16*1,392=22,272. Remainder 3. Next digit is 3.

1,392 ÷16=87, remainder 0. Next digit is 0.

87 ÷16=5, remainder 7. Next digit is7.

5 ÷16=0, remainder5. So the digits from last to first are 5,7,0,3,1,E.

So putting it together: 5 7 0 3 1 E.

Wait, but that would be 57031E_16. Let me check the calculation again because I'm getting 57031E, but let's see the options.

Looking at the options, part c) is the third value. Option H has part c) as 57031D_16. But I got 57031E_16. Hmm, that's a discrepancy. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, let's recheck the division steps.

Starting with 5,702,430.

First division by 16:

5,702,430 ÷16: 16 × 356,401 = 5,702,416. Remainder 14 → E.

So first digit (LSB) is E.

Next, take 356,401 ÷16: 16 ×22,275=356,400. Remainder 1 → next digit is1.

Next, 22,275 ÷16: 16 ×1,392=22,272. Remainder 3 → next digit is3.

1,392 ÷16: 16 ×87=1,392. Remainder 0 → next digit is0.

87 ÷16: 16 ×5=80. Remainder7 → next digit is7.

5 ÷16: 0 ×16=0. Remainder5 → next digit is5.

So the hex digits are 5 7 0 3 1 E → 57031E_16.

But option H for part c) is 57031D_16. So that's a problem. Did I make a mistake in the multiplication earlier?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the multiplication of the two hex numbers. Let me double-check.

5AB_16 is 5*256 +10*16 +11*1 =1280 +160 +11=1451.

F5A_16 is 15*256 +5*16 +10 =3840 +80 +10=3930.

1451 * 3930.

Let me compute this more carefully.

Compute 1451 × 3930.

Let me break it down as (1400 +51) × (3900 +30).

Wait, perhaps a better way is to compute 1451 ×3930.

Compute 1451 × 3000 = 4,353,000.

1451 ×900 = 1,305,900.

1451 ×30=43,530.

Adding these together: 4,353,000 +1,305,900 =5,658,900.

5,658,900 +43,530=5,702,430. So that's correct.

So the product is indeed 5,702,430 in decimal, which converts to 57031E_16.

Looking back at the options, none of the options have 57031E_16 for part c). Let me check the options again.

Option H: part c) is 57031D_16. That's off by one. Did I make a mistake in the conversion?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the conversion from decimal to hex. Let me try again.

5,702,430 ÷16: 5,702,430 ÷16 = 356,401 with a remainder of 14 (E). 

356,401 ÷16: 356,401 ÷16 = 22,275 with a remainder of 1.

22,275 ÷16: 22,275 ÷16 = 1,392 with a remainder of 3.

1,392 ÷16=87 with remainder 0.

87 ÷16=5 with remainder 7.

5 ÷16=0 with remainder5.

So the hex digits are 5 7 0 3 1 E → 57031E_16.

Hmm, so the correct hex should be 57031E_16, but none of the options have that. Let me look at the options again.

Looking back, option J has part c) as F5A0AB_16, which seems unrelated. Option H's part c) is 57031D_16. That's one less than my result. Maybe I made a mistake in the multiplication, perhaps in the hex numbers.

Wait, let me double-check the hex to decimal conversion.

5AB_16: 5 is 5, A is 10, B is 11.

So 5*16^2 +10*16 +11 =5*256=1280, 10*16=160, 11=11. Total 1280+160=1440, +11=1451. Correct.

F5A_16: F=15,5=5,A=10.

15*16^2=15*256=3840, 5*16=80, 10=10. Total 3840+80=3920+10=3930. Correct.

So 1451*3930=5,702,430. That's correct.

So the hex conversion must be correct as 57031E_16.

Looking at the options, I don't see any option where part c) is 57031E_16. Let me check all the options again.

Option A: c) ABF55C_16. No.

Option B: c) 1DF570_16. No.

Option C: c) 5AB0F5_16. No.

Option D: c) FEDCBA_16. No.

Option E: c)0F5A5B_16. No.

Option F: c) ABCDEF_16. No.

Option G: c) A55A1F_16. No.

Option H: c)57031D_16. No, it's D instead of E.

Option I: c)12345F_16. No.

Option J: c)F5A0AB_16. No.

Hmm, so none of the options have 57031E_16. Did I make a mistake somewhere?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the multiplication. Let me check 1451 ×3930 again.

Wait, 1451 ×3930. Let me compute it differently.

Compute 1451 ×3930 =1451 × (3000 +930) =1451×3000 +1451×930.

1451×3000=4,353,000.

1451×930: Let's compute 1451×900=1,305,900.

1451×30=43,530.

Adding them: 1,305,900 +43,530=1,349,430.

Adding to 4,353,000: 4,353,000 +1,349,430=5,702,430. Correct.

So the product is correct. Therefore, the hex conversion must be correct as 57031E_16. Since none of the options have this, perhaps I made a mistake in the hex conversion.

Wait, perhaps I should try a different approach to convert 5,702,430 to hex.

Another method: Find the largest hex power less than the number.

16^5=1,048,576.

5,702,430 ÷1,048,576 ≈5.438. So coefficient is5.

5 ×1,048,576=5,242,880.

Subtract:5,702,430 -5,242,880=459,550.

Next, 16^4=65,536.

459,550 ÷65,536≈6.999. So coefficient is6.

6 ×65,536=393,216.

Subtract:459,550 -393,216=66,334.

Next, 16^3=4096.

66,334 ÷4096≈16.20. But since each digit can't exceed 15, perhaps I made a mistake here. Wait, 4096 ×16=65,536, which is larger than 66,334. So the coefficient is16, but that's not allowed. So maybe I should adjust.

Wait, 4096 ×16=65,536, which is less than 66,334. So coefficient is16, but that's invalid. Hmm, perhaps I should instead take 16^3 ×16 =16^4, but that's already handled.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Let me try another method.

Alternatively, perhaps I can break the number down:

5,702,430 = 5,242,880 (5*16^5) + 459,550.

459,550 = 6*65,536 (16^4) = 393,216. Subtract:459,550-393,216=66,334.

66,334 = 16*4096 (16^3) =65,536. 66,334-65,536=798.

798 = 3*256 (16^2) =768. 798-768=30.

30 = 1*16 (16^1) =16. 30-16=14.

14 = 14*1 (16^0) =14.

So compiling the coefficients:

16^5:5

16^4:6

16^3:16 → which is invalid, so perhaps I need to adjust.

Wait, but 16^3 can't have 16 as a coefficient. So perhaps I made an error in calculation.

Wait, 66,334 ÷4096=16.20. So 16 *4096=65,536. 66,334-65,536=798.

So, coefficients so far:

5 (16^5), 6 (16^4), 16 (16^3), which is invalid. So perhaps I should carry over the 16 to higher digits. But since higher digits have already been processed, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should try a different approach. Let me use a calculator to convert 5,702,430 to hex.

Alternatively, I can use the fact that 5,702,430 ÷16=356,401.875. Wait, no, earlier calculation showed it was 356,401 with remainder 14. So the last digit is E.

356,401 ÷16=22,275.0625, which is 22,275 with remainder 1. So next digit is1.

22,275 ÷16=1,392.1875 →1,392 with remainder3.

1,392 ÷16=87 with remainder 0.

87 ÷16=5.4375 →5 with remainder7.

5 ÷16=0 with remainder5.

So the hex digits are 5,7,0,3,1,E →57031E_16.

So the correct answer for part c) is 57031E_16. But none of the options have that. Hmm.

Wait, looking back, perhaps I made a mistake in the multiplication of the two hex numbers. Let me check 5AB_16 × F5A_16.

Alternatively, perhaps I can try multiplying them directly in hex.

Let me attempt to multiply 5AB by F5A in hex.

But this might be time-consuming. Let me see.

First, write down 5AB
× F5A
------------

Let me convert each digit:

5AB is 5, A (10), B (11).

F5A is F (15), 5, A (10).

Multiplying as in hex:

First, multiply 5AB by A (the units place of F5A).

5AB × A:

A is 10.

B × A = 11×10=110. In hex, 110 ÷16=6 rem 14 (E). So write down E, carry over 6.

A × A =10×10=100. Plus carryover 6=106. 106 ÷16=6 rem 10 (A). Write down A, carry over6.

5 × A=5×10=50. Plus carryover6=56. 56 ÷16=3 rem 8. Write 8, carry over3.

So 5AB × A = 38E8? Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, perhaps I should do it step by step.

Wait, perhaps it's better to handle each step properly.

Wait, actually, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Since I know the decimal product is 5,702,430, which is 57031E_16, but none of the options match, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier parts.

Wait, looking back, perhaps part a) was miscalculated. Let me check that again.

Part a): 3652_8 ×24_8.

3652_8 in decimal: 3*8^3 +6*8^2 +5*8 +2 =3*512=1536, 6*64=384, 5*8=40, 2=2. Total=1536+384=1920+40=1960+2=1962.

24_8 is2*8 +4=20.

1962 ×20=39240.

39240 ÷8=4905 rem0.

4905 ÷8=613 rem1.

613 ÷8=76 rem5.

76 ÷8=9 rem4.

9 ÷8=1 rem1.

1 ÷8=0 rem1.

So the octal is 1 1 4 5 1 0 →114510_8. So part a) is correct in option H.

Part b):11.01_2 ×1.01_2 =100.0001_2. As I calculated earlier, which matches option H's part b).

So parts a) and b) in option H are correct. But part c) is wrong because the correct hex is 57031E_16, but option H has 57031D_16. So either I made a mistake, or perhaps the options have a typo.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the hex conversion. Let me check 5,702,430 in hex again.

Using a calculator: 5,702,430 in hex is 57031E. So option H's part c) is off by one. Maybe I should check if the hex product is indeed 57031E or 57031D.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the multiplication. Let me compute 5AB × F5A in hex.

Wait, 5AB × F5A. Let me try to compute this step by step.

First, write down 5AB × F5A.

We can compute it as:

5AB × F5A = 5AB × (F00 +50 +A).

Compute each part and sum.

Compute 5AB × F00:

5AB × F = ?

Wait, 5AB × F: Let me compute 5AB × F in hex.

5AB × F:

B × F = 11 ×15 =165. 165 ÷16=10 rem5 → A5. So write down 5, carry over A.

A × F =10 ×15=150. Plus carryover A (10) →150+10=160. 160 ÷16=10 rem0 → A0. Write down 0, carry over A.

5 × F=5×15=75. Plus carryover A (10)=85. 85 ÷16=5 rem5. So 55.

So 5AB × F = 55A5.

But since we're multiplying by F00, it's 55A5 shifted two places: 55A500.

Next, 5AB ×50:

5AB ×5 = ?

B ×5=55. 55 ÷16=3 rem7 → 37.

A ×5=50 →32 in hex (50 is 5*16 +0=80, wait no: 50 in hex is 5*16 +0=80 in decimal. Wait, I'm confusing.

Wait, 5AB ×50: Let me compute it properly.

5AB ×5: 

B ×5=55 (decimal) → 37 in hex (3*16 +7=55).

A ×5=50 →32 in hex (since 5*16=80, but 50 in hex is 80 in decimal. Wait, perhaps I should compute each digit correctly.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute 5AB ×5 in decimal.

5AB is 5*256 +10*16 +11=1280+160+11=1451.

1451 ×5=7255.

7255 in hex: Let's compute.

7255 ÷16=453 rem7 →7.

453 ÷16=28 rem5 →5.

28 ÷16=1 rem12 →C.

1 ÷16=0 rem1 →1.

So 7255 is 1C57_16.

Since we're multiplying by 50 (which is 5 ×10 in hex, i.e., 5×16=80 in decimal), we need to shift left by 1 (since 50 is 5×16^1). So 7255 ×16=116,080.

Wait, no, 5AB ×50 is 5AB ×5 ×16^1.

So 5AB ×5 is 7255, then multiply by 16 (shift left by 4 bits) →7255 ×16=116,080.

Convert 116,080 to hex:

116,080 ÷16=7,255 rem0.

7,255 ÷16=453 rem7.

453 ÷16=28 rem5.

28 ÷16=1 rem12 →C.

1 ÷16=0 rem1.

So 116,080 is 1C570_16.

Next, 5AB ×A:

5AB ×A is 5AB ×10 in hex.

5AB ×10 in hex is the same as shifting left by 4 bits (multiplying by 16). So 5AB ×10 =5AB0_16.

But in decimal, 5AB is 1451, so 1451 ×16=23,216.

Now, sum all three parts:

55A500_16 (55A500 is 5,702,400 in decimal? Let me check: 5*16^5=5*1,048,576=5,242,880; 5*16^4=5*65,536=327,680; A*16^3=10*4096=40,960;5*16^2=5*256=1,280;0*16=0;0=0. Adding them:5,242,880 +327,680=5,570,560 +40,960=5,611,520 +1,280=5,612,800. Wait, that's not matching 5,702,400. Hmm, perhaps my approach is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps I should sum the three parts in hex.

Wait, this is getting too complicated. I think I'll stick with my earlier conclusion that the correct hex is 57031E_16, which isn't listed in any option. Therefore, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, looking back, perhaps I made a mistake in the multiplication of 5AB and F5A. Let me try to compute 5AB ×F5A again in hex.

Alternatively, perhaps I should accept that option H is the correct one because parts a) and b) match, and perhaps I made a mistake in part c). Maybe I should choose option H.

But wait, the correct answer for part c) is 57031E_16, which isn't in the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the multiplication. Let me check 5AB × F5A again.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 5AB × F5A in hex:

First, 5AB × F5A:

Let me break it down into parts.

5AB × F5A =5AB × (F00 +50 +A).

Compute each part:

1. 5AB × F00:

5AB × F = ?

5AB × F:

Starting from the right:

B × F = 11 ×15=165 →165 ÷16=10 rem5 →A5. Write 5, carry over A.

A × F=10×15=150 +A=10 →160 →160 ÷16=10 rem0 →A0. Write 0, carry over A.

5 × F=5×15=75 +A=10 →85 →85 ÷16=5 rem5 →55.

So 5AB × F =55A5.

So 5AB × F00 =55A500.

2. 5AB ×50:

5AB ×5=7255 (as before). 7255 in hex is1C57.

Shift left by one (since ×10 in hex is ×16 decimal):1C570.

3. 5AB ×A:

5AB ×A=5AB0 (shift left by four bits).

Now, sum all three parts:

55A500

+001C570

+0005AB0

Let me add them in hex.

First, add 55A500 and 001C570.

55A500
+001C570
=?

Let me align them:

  55A500
+ 001C570
=?

Add each column from right:

0+0=0

0+7=7

5 +5=10 (A)

A +C= 10+12=22 →22 ÷16=1 rem6 →carry 1, write 6.

5 +1=6.

5 +0=5.

So the sum is 5621A70? Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in addition.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to convert each to decimal and add.

55A500_16: 5*16^5 +5*16^4 +A*16^3 +5*16^2 +0*16 +0.

5*1,048,576=5,242,880

5*65,536=327,680

A=10*4096=40,960

5*256=1,280

0+0=0

Total:5,242,880 +327,680=5,570,560 +40,960=5,611,520 +1,280=5,612,800.

001C570_16: 1*16^5 +C*16^4 +5*16^3 +7*16^2 +0*16 +0.

1*1,048,576=1,048,576

C=12*65,536=786,432

5*4096=20,480

7*256=1,792

0+0=0.

Total:1,048,576 +786,432=1,835,008 +20,480=1,855,488 +1,792=1,857,280.

Adding to 5,612,800:5,612,800 +1,857,280=7,470,080.

Now add 0005AB0_16, which is 5*16^4 +A*16^3 +B*16^2 +0.

5*65,536=327,680

A=10*4096=40,960

B=11*256=2,816

0=0.

Total:327,680 +40,960=368,640 +2,816=371,456.

Adding to 7,470,080:7,470,080 +371,456=7,841,536.

Now, 7,841,536 in hex:

7,841,536 ÷16=490,096 rem0.

490,096 ÷16=30,631 rem0.

30,631 ÷16=1,914 rem7.

1,914 ÷16=119 rem10 (A).

119 ÷16=7 rem7.

7 ÷16=0 rem7.

Reading remainders from bottom:7,7,A,7,0,0 →77A700_16.

Wait, that can't be right because earlier the sum was 7,841,536, which is 77A700_16.

But earlier in decimal, the product was 5,702,430, which is different. So I must have made a mistake in this approach.

I think I'm getting stuck here, and perhaps I should conclude that option H is the correct one because parts a) and b) match, and perhaps I made a mistake in part c). Alternatively, maybe the correct option isn't listed, but among the options given, H is the only one where a) and b) are correct.
</think>

The correct answer is **H**, as parts a) and b) match the calculations, and part c) is likely a typo.

ANSWER: H
