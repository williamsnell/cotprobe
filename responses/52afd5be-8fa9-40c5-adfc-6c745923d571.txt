Okay, so I have this question about ethnic identity, and I need to figure out what it refers to. Let me read the options again and think through each one carefully.

The question is asking, "Ethnic identity refers to..." and I have to choose from options A to J. I remember that ethnic identity has to do with how someone identifies with their ethnic group, including their cultural practices and traditions. But let me go through each option to make sure.

Option A says it's a rejection of Caucasian social, cultural, and institutional standards. Hmm, that sounds more like a form of resistance or opposition rather than what ethnic identity is. I think ethnic identity is more about embracing one's own group rather than rejecting another's.

Option B is the rejection of all cultural traditions and practices. That doesn't sound right either. Rejecting all traditions would imply a complete abandonment, which doesn't fit with the concept of identity, which usually involves some level of acceptance or participation.

Option C says it's the extent to which an individual endorses and practices the ethnocultural traditions of a given group. That sounds plausible. Ethnic identity often involves how much someone identifies with and follows the traditions of their ethnic group. So this might be the correct answer.

Option D refers to cultural practices and beliefs that are non-Western. That's too narrow because ethnic identity can include any cultural background, not just non-Western ones. It's not limited to that.

Option E is about adhering only to Western cultural traditions. Again, that's too specific and doesn't cover the broader concept of ethnic identity, which can apply to any ethnic group, Western or otherwise.

Option F is the extent to which an individual rejects their own ethnocultural traditions. Wait, that's the opposite of ethnic identity. Ethnic identity is about embracing, not rejecting, one's own traditions. So this is probably not the right choice.

Option G talks about adopting multiple ethnic identities and practices. That might be more related to multiculturalism or acculturation, where someone identifies with more than one group. But ethnic identity is more singular, about one's primary group.

Option H is about practicing the traditions of the majority culture. That's more about cultural assimilation rather than ethnic identity, which focuses on one's own group, not necessarily the majority.

Option I refers to the collective cultural practices of ethnic minority communities. While ethnic identity does involve a group aspect, this option seems to focus on the collective more than the individual's personal endorsement and practice. So maybe not the best fit.

Option J is about adopting the cultural practices of the dominant group. That sounds like assimilation again, not ethnic identity.

So, going back, Option C seems to fit best because it's about how much someone endorses and practices their own ethnic group's traditions. It's about the individual's connection and participation in their ethnic culture, which aligns with what I know about ethnic identity.
