Okay, so I need to compute the covariance of two variables x and y. The data given is x = (1,2,3,4) and y = (2,3,4,5). I'm a bit rusty on statistics, but I'll try to remember how covariance works.

First, I think covariance measures how much two variables change together. The formula, if I recall correctly, is something like the average of the product of the deviations of each variable from their respective means. So, I need to find the mean of x and the mean of y first.

Let me calculate the mean of x. The numbers are 1, 2, 3, 4. Adding them up: 1+2=3, 3+3=6, 6+4=10. So the sum is 10, and there are 4 numbers, so the mean is 10/4 = 2.5.

Now for y: 2, 3, 4, 5. Summing these: 2+3=5, 5+4=9, 9+5=14. So sum is 14, mean is 14/4 = 3.5.

Next step is to find the deviations from the mean for each corresponding pair of x and y. That means for each i, I subtract the mean of x from each x_i and the mean of y from each y_i, then multiply these two deviations together, and sum all those products up. Then I divide by (n-1) if it's sample covariance, or by n if it's population covariance. Wait, but the question doesn't specify sample or population. Hmm, maybe I should go with population covariance since the data might be considered the entire population here.

So let's list out each pair:

For i=1: x=1, y=2.
x deviation: 1 - 2.5 = -1.5
y deviation: 2 - 3.5 = -1.5
Product: (-1.5)*(-1.5) = 2.25

i=2: x=2, y=3.
x dev: 2-2.5 = -0.5
y dev: 3-3.5 = -0.5
Product: (-0.5)*(-0.5)=0.25

i=3: x=3, y=4.
x dev: 3-2.5=0.5
y dev:4-3.5=0.5
Product: 0.5*0.5=0.25

i=4: x=4, y=5.
x dev:4-2.5=1.5
y dev:5-3.5=1.5
Product:1.5*1.5=2.25

Now sum all these products: 2.25 + 0.25 = 2.5, plus 0.25 is 2.75, plus 2.25 gives 5. So total sum is 5.

Now, since it's population covariance, I divide by n which is 4. So 5/4 = 1.25.

Wait, but sometimes covariance is calculated with (n-1) in the denominator, especially when dealing with samples. That would make it 5/3 ≈ 1.6667. Hmm, which option is that? Looking at the options, F is 1.67, which is approximately 1.6667. But wait, the question doesn't specify sample or population. 

But wait, in many statistical contexts, when the entire dataset is given and not a sample, we use population covariance, which is divided by n. So 5/4=1.25, which is option E.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me double-check. Covariance formula:

Cov(x,y) = [Σ(x_i - μ_x)(y_i - μ_y)] / n

So, yes, it's divided by n.

So 5 divided by 4 is 1.25, which is option E.

Alternatively, sometimes in some contexts, especially introductory stats, they might use n-1 for the sample covariance. But I think in this case, since the question says 'compute covariance', without specifying, it's safer to go with population covariance, so 1.25, option E.

The covariance is calculated using the population formula, resulting in 1.25.

Answer: E
