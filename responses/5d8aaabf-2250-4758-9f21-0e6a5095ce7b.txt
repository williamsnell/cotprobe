Question:

A baseball fan purchased two tickets for a World Series baseball game. The fan contacted his best friend and invited him to go to the game. The friend, who was a fanatic baseball fan, eagerly agreed. The fan told the friend that the game started at 7:00 p. m. and that he would pick him up at about 5:00 p. m. so they could get there early to watch batting practice. They were driving to the game together when the fan sped up to cross an intersection while the traffic signal was changing from amber to red. As he reached the intersection, the fan was traveling at 50 m. p. h. although the posted speed limit was 25 m. p. h. Simultaneously, a car entered the intersection on red and collided with the fan's vehicle. The friend suffered a broken pelvis in the collision. This jurisdiction has adopted the following "modified" comparative negligence statute:"A negligent plaintiff is entitled to obtain a recovery provided plaintiff's negligence is not equal to or greater than that of the defendant's; otherwise no recovery is permitted. "Suppose the friend brings suit against the driver of the car that entered the intersection on the red light to recover damages for his injury. Ajury returned a special verdict with the following findings: (1) The fan was 55 percent negligent in speeding; (2) The driver was 45 percent negligent in driving through the red light; and (3) The friend suffered $100,000 in damages. As a result, the court should enter a judgment for the friend in the amount of

Options:

A: $45,000. 00
B: $50,000.00
C: nothing, because the fan was more negligentthan the driver.
D: A split judgment where the fan pays $55,000.00 and the driver pays $45,000.00
E: $100,000.00 but paid by both the fan and the driver
F: $45,000.00 but only from the driver's insurance
G: $55,000. 00
H: $55,000.00 but only from the fan's insurance
I: $55,000.00 from the driver as the fan was more negligent
J: $100,000. 00

Okay, so I have this tort law question here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again carefully.

So, the situation is about a baseball fan who bought two tickets and invited his friend to a game. They agreed to meet, and the fan was supposed to pick up his friend at 5 pm to get to the game early. On their way, the fan was speeding through an intersection when the light was changing from amber to red. He was going 50 mph in a 25 mph zone. At the same time, another car entered the intersection on a red light and collided with the fan's car. The friend got a broken pelvis and $100,000 in damages.

The jurisdiction has a modified comparative negligence statute. The statute says that a plaintiff can recover if their negligence isn't equal to or greater than the defendant's. So, if the plaintiff is 50% or more negligent, they can't recover anything.

The jury found three things: (1) the fan was 55% negligent for speeding, (2) the driver was 45% negligent for running the red light, and (3) the friend's damages were $100k.

The question is, what judgment should the court enter for the friend?

The options are A through J, with various amounts and reasons.

First, I need to understand the comparative negligence here. The key is that the plaintiff (the friend) is suing the driver. So, the friend is the plaintiff, and the driver is the defendant.

In comparative negligence, each party's percentage of fault is considered. The statute says the plaintiff can recover unless their negligence is equal to or greater than the defendant's. So, if the plaintiff's negligence is 50% or more, they get nothing.

Here, the friend (plaintiff) is suing the driver (defendant). The jury found the fan (who is the plaintiff's friend, but in this case, the plaintiff is the friend, so perhaps the fan is a third party?) Wait, no. Wait, the friend is the plaintiff, and he's suing the driver. So, the fan's negligence is being considered as that of the plaintiff's own actions? Or is the fan a separate party?

Wait, the fan is the driver, right? Because the fan was the one speeding through the intersection. So the fan is the defendant in the friend's lawsuit? Or wait, no. The friend is suing the driver who ran the red light. So the fan and the other driver are the two parties involved in the collision.

Wait, the friend is the plaintiff, and he's suing the driver who entered on red. So, the defendant is that other driver.

But the jury found that the fan was 55% negligent and the driver was 45% negligent. So, the fan's negligence is 55%, and the driver's is 45%. But wait, the fan is the plaintiff's friend, but the friend (plaintiff) was a passenger in the fan's car. So, the friend is suing the other driver, but the fan's negligence contributed to the accident.

Wait, but in this case, the friend is suing the other driver, so the fan's negligence would be considered in terms of how it affects the friend's recovery against the driver.

Wait, no. The friend is suing the driver, so the defendant is the driver. The fan is the other party involved. But the question is whether the friend's negligence (if any) affects his claim against the driver.

Wait, perhaps the friend is not negligent, but the fan is the driver who was speeding. So, the friend is the passenger, and the driver (fan) was negligent, but the friend is suing the other driver (the one who ran the red light). So, in this case, the friend's recovery is against the other driver, but the fan's negligence is being considered as a third party.

Wait, that's getting a bit confusing. Let me think again.

The friend is the plaintiff, suing the driver (defendant) who ran the red light. The jury found that the fan (the driver of the plaintiff's car) was 55% negligent, and the defendant driver was 45% negligent. So, the total negligence is 100%, with the fan at 55% and the defendant at 45%.

But wait, the friend is suing the defendant driver. So, does the friend's own negligence come into play? Or is the friend not at fault here?

Wait, the friend was a passenger. The question is whether the friend's own negligence contributed to his injuries. But the jury didn't assign any negligence to the friend; they assigned 55% to the fan (the driver) and 45% to the defendant driver. So, the friend's own negligence is zero? Or perhaps the fan's negligence is considered as the plaintiff's own because he was the driver.

Wait, no. The friend is suing the driver (defendant) for his injuries. So, the friend's own negligence would only be his own, but in this case, the jury didn't find any negligence on the friend's part. It found 55% on the fan (the driver) and 45% on the defendant driver.

Wait, but the fan is the driver of the plaintiff's car, so perhaps the fan's negligence is the same as the plaintiff's for the purpose of comparative negligence. Or is the fan a separate party?

I think I'm getting confused here. Let me clarify the parties:

- The plaintiff is the friend, who was a passenger in the fan's car.

- The defendant is the driver of the other car who ran the red light.

- The fan (driver of the plaintiff's car) is a separate person, but in this case, the jury assigned 55% negligence to the fan (for speeding) and 45% to the defendant.

So, the friend is suing the defendant driver. The question is, how does the fan's negligence factor into this?

In comparative negligence, each party's percentage is compared. The statute says the plaintiff can recover unless their negligence is equal to or greater than the defendant's.

So, the friend (plaintiff) is suing the defendant driver. The friend's own negligence would be his percentage of fault in causing his own injuries. But in this case, the jury didn't assign any negligence to the friend; they assigned 55% to the fan and 45% to the defendant.

Wait, but the fan is the driver, so perhaps the fan's negligence is the same as the plaintiff's because the plaintiff was in the fan's car. Or is the fan a third party?

Alternatively, perhaps the fan's negligence is the plaintiff's own negligence because the plaintiff was in his own vehicle, but that doesn't make sense because the plaintiff was a passenger. Wait, no, the plaintiff was the passenger, so the driver's negligence (the fan) would be considered in terms of how it contributed to the plaintiff's injuries.

Wait, but in this case, the friend is the passenger, and the driver is the fan. So, the fan's negligence is the same as the plaintiff's own negligence because the plaintiff was in his own vehicle. Wait, no, the plaintiff is suing the other driver, so perhaps the fan's negligence is considered as the plaintiff's own negligence in the context of the lawsuit against the defendant.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me think again.

The friend is the plaintiff, suing the driver (defendant) who ran the red light. The fan is the driver of the plaintiff's car, who was speeding, contributing 55% to the accident, and the defendant driver contributed 45%. So, the total is 100%.

In comparative negligence, the plaintiff's recovery is reduced by their percentage of fault, but only if their fault is less than the defendant's. If the plaintiff's fault is equal to or greater, they recover nothing.

In this case, the plaintiff (friend) is suing the defendant (driver). The jury found that the fan (driver) was 55% negligent and the defendant was 45% negligent. So, does that mean the plaintiff's own negligence is 55% because he was in the fan's car?

Wait, no. The friend is the passenger, so his own negligence would be separate. But the jury didn't assign any negligence to the friend; it assigned 55% to the fan (the driver) and 45% to the defendant.

So, the friend's own negligence is zero. Therefore, the defendant's negligence is 45%, and the fan's negligence is 55%. But the friend is suing the defendant, so the question is whether the friend's own negligence is considered, or the fan's.

Wait, this is getting confusing. Let me try to break it down.

In a lawsuit between the friend (P) and the driver (D), the friend's damages are $100k. The jury found that the fan (driver of P's car) was 55% negligent, and D was 45% negligent.

But in this context, the fan is a third party, not a party to this lawsuit. So, when the friend is suing D, the only negligence in this case is between P and D. Wait, but the fan's negligence is part of the cause of the accident.

Wait, perhaps the fan's negligence is considered as the plaintiff's own negligence because the fan is the driver of the plaintiff's car. So, if the driver (fan) was negligent, that would be the plaintiff's negligence in the context of suing the defendant.

So, in this case, the plaintiff's negligence is 55%, and the defendant's is 45%. Since the plaintiff's negligence (55%) is greater than the defendant's (45%), under the modified comparative negligence statute, the plaintiff cannot recover anything. Because the statute says if the plaintiff's negligence is equal to or greater than the defendant's, no recovery.

Therefore, the friend cannot recover from the driver because his own negligence (through the driver, the fan) was 55%, which is more than the defendant's 45%.

So, the court should enter judgment for nothing.

Looking at the options, option C says "nothing, because the fan was more negligent than the driver."

Yes, that makes sense. So the answer should be C.
</think>

The friend (plaintiff) is suing the driver (defendant) who ran the red light. The jury found the fan (driver of the plaintiff's car) 55% negligent and the defendant 45% negligent. Under the modified comparative negligence statute, the plaintiff cannot recover if their negligence equals or exceeds the defendant's. Here, the plaintiff's negligence (55%) is greater than the defendant's (45%), so the friend cannot recover damages.

**Answer: C**
