Question:

At high pressures and temperatures a quite good equation of state is P(V - nb) = nRT, where b is a constant. Find (\partialV / \partialT)_P and (\partialV / \partialP)_T from this equation and hence dV in terms of P, T, (V - nb), dT and dP.

Options:

A: dV= - [(V - nb) / P]dP - [(V - nb) / T]dT
B: dV= - [(V - nb) / P]dP + [(V - nb) / T]dT = (V - nb) [- (dP / P) + (dT / T)]
C: dV= [(V - nb) / P]dP - [(V - nb) / T]dT
D: dV= [(V - nb) / P]dP + [(V - nb) / T]dT

Okay, so I've got this problem here about finding the partial derivatives of V with respect to P and T, and then expressing dV in terms of dP and dT. Hmm, let's see. The equation of state given is P(V - nb) = nRT. I remember that when dealing with equations of state, partial derivatives are key for finding expressions like (∂V/∂T)_P and (∂V/∂P)_T.

First, I need to find (∂V/∂T) at constant pressure P. Let me start by rearranging the equation to solve for V. So, from P(V - nb) = nRT, I can write V = (nRT)/(P) + nb. That simplifies things a bit.

Now, to find (∂V/∂T)_P, I treat P as a constant. So V is a function of T, with P held constant. Looking at V = (nRT)/(P) + nb, the derivative of V with respect to T would be (nR/P) because nb is a constant and its derivative is zero. So (∂V/∂T)_P = nR/P. Wait, but in the equation, V appears as (V - nb), so maybe I should consider that in a different way. Alternatively, perhaps I should approach it using implicit differentiation.

Let me think again. The equation is P(V - nb) = nRT. Taking the partial derivative with respect to T at constant P, we have P*(∂/∂T)(V - nb) = nR ∂T/∂T. Since nb is a constant, ∂/∂T (V - nb) is ∂V/∂T. So, P*(∂V/∂T) = nR. Therefore, (∂V/∂T)_P = nR / P. But wait, the answer options don't have R or n, so maybe I'm missing something here. Alternatively, perhaps I should express it in terms of V. Let me hold on that thought.

Next, I need to find (∂V/∂P)_T. Again, starting from P(V - nb) = nRT. Now, taking the partial derivative with respect to P at constant T. So, on the left side, it's (V - nb) + P*(∂V/∂P) because P is multiplied by (V - nb), which depends on P through V. Wait, no, actually, it's the derivative of P*(V - nb) with respect to P, which is (V - nb) + P*(∂V/∂P) because d/dP [P * f(P)] = f(P) + P*f’(P). On the right side, nR is constant, so the derivative of T with respect to P is zero (since T is constant here). So, putting it together: (V - nb) + P*(∂V/∂P) = 0. Therefore, P*(∂V/∂P) = -(V - nb), so (∂V/∂P)_T = -(V - nb)/(P).

Wait, but in the equation P(V - nb) = nRT, perhaps I can express V in terms of P and T. Let me solve for V: V = (nRT)/(P) + nb. So, V - nb = (nRT)/P. Then, (∂V/∂P)_T would be the derivative of [nRT/P + nb] with respect to P. nb is constant, so derivative is -nRT/P². But wait, nRT is from the equation as P(V - nb) = nRT, so nRT = P(V - nb). So, substituting, (∂V/∂P)_T = - [P(V - nb)] / P² = -(V - nb)/P. That matches what I found earlier. So, that's correct.

Now, moving on to finding dV. The total differential dV is given by the sum of the partial derivatives multiplied by their respective differentials: dV = (∂V/∂T)_P dT + (∂V/∂P)_T dP.

From earlier, I have (∂V/∂T)_P = nR/P, but wait, the options don't involve R or n. Hmm, maybe I should express it differently. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps instead of solving for V explicitly, I should take the total derivative of the equation P(V - nb) = nRT. That might be a better approach.

So, taking the total derivative of both sides:

d[P(V - nb)] = d(nRT).

Left side: Using product rule, dP*(V - nb) + P*d(V - nb). Since nb is constant, d(V - nb) = dV.

So left side becomes: (V - nb) dP + P dV.

Right side: nR dT, since n is constant.

Putting it together:

(V - nb) dP + P dV = nR dT.

Now, solve for dV:

P dV = nR dT - (V - nb) dP.

Divide both sides by P:

dV = [nR/P dT] - [(V - nb)/P dP].

Hmm, but looking at the options, they don't have nR. So perhaps I should express nR in terms of the equation. From the original equation, P(V - nb) = nRT, so nR = P(V - nb)/T.

Substituting nR into dV:

dV = [ (P(V-nb)/T ) / P ] dT - [ (V-nb)/P ] dP.

Simplify:

dV = [ (V - nb)/T ] dT - [ (V - nb)/P ] dP.

Which can be written as:

dV = - [ (V - nb)/P ] dP + [ (V - nb)/T ] dT.

So, in terms of partial derivatives, this can be expressed as dV = (∂V/∂T)_P dT + (∂V/∂P)_T dP, where (∂V/∂T)_P = (V - nb)/T and (∂V/∂P)_T = - (V - nb)/P.

Wait, but I thought earlier that (∂V/∂T)_P was nR/P, but when I took the derivative through the equation, I found it to be (V - nb)/T. Let me check that again.

Alternatively, perhaps using the equation P(V - nb) = nRT, so V - nb = (nRT)/P. Then, (∂V/∂T)_P would be (nR)/P, which is correct. But in the total derivative approach, I arrived at (∂V/∂T)_P = (V - nb)/T, which is the same as (nRT/(P)) / T = nR/(P). So yes, both agree.

Wait, so (∂V/∂T)_P = (V - nb)/T = (nRT/(P)) / T = nR/P. So that's correct.

Similarly, (∂V/∂P)_T is -(V - nb)/P, as found earlier.

So putting it all together, dV = (∂V/∂T)_P dT + (∂V/∂P)_T dP = [(V - nb)/T] dT - [(V - nb)/P] dP.

Which can be written as dV = - [(V - nb)/P] dP + [(V - nb)/T] dT.

Looking at the options, option B says: dV= - [(V - nb)/P]dP + [(V - nb)/T]dT, which equals (V - nb)[ -dP/P + dT/T ].

Yes, that matches exactly what I derived. So the correct answer should be option B.

To solve the problem, we start with the given equation of state: 

\[
P(V - nb) = nRT
\]

### Step 1: Find \((\partial V / \partial T)_P\)
At constant pressure \(P\), we differentiate the equation implicitly with respect to \(T\):

\[
P \frac{\partial V}{\partial T} = nR
\]

Solving for \((\partial V / \partial T)_P\):

\[
\left(\frac{\partial V}{\partial T}\right)_P = \frac{nR}{P}
\]

### Step 2: Find \((\partial V / \partial P)_T\)
At constant temperature \(T\), we differentiate the equation implicitly with respect to \(P\):

\[
(V - nb) + P \frac{\partial V}{\partial P} = 0
\]

Solving for \((\partial V / \partial P)_T\):

\[
\left(\frac{\partial V}{\partial P}\right)_T = -\frac{V - nb}{P}
\]

### Step 3: Express \(dV\) in terms of \(dP\) and \(dT\)
The total differential \(dV\) is given by:

\[
dV = \left(\frac{\partial V}{\partial T}\right)_P dT + \left(\frac{\partial V}{\partial P}\right)_T dP
\]

Substituting the partial derivatives:

\[
dV = \frac{nR}{P} dT - \frac{V - nb}{P} dP
\]

Using the original equation \(P(V - nb) = nRT\), we substitute \(nR = \frac{P(V - nb)}{T}\):

\[
dV = \frac{V - nb}{T} dT - \frac{V - nb}{P} dP
\]

Thus:

\[
dV = -\frac{V - nb}{P} dP + \frac{V - nb}{T} dT
\]

This matches **Option B**.
