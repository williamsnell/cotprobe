Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it carefully.

The problem is about the production of paper pulp using calcium bisulfite, Ca(HSO3)2. The process starts with digesting wood chips using this solution, which breaks down lignin and resins, leaving pure cellulose. The sulfite solution is prepared through a series of reactions. 

The question has two parts, (a) and (b). Let's tackle them one by one.

Starting with part (a): For every 250 kg of limestone (CaCO3) used, how much sulfur would be required?

Hmm, I think I need to look at the chemical equations provided. The problem lists several reactions:

1. S + O2 → SO2
2. SO2 + H2O → H2SO3
3. CaCO3 + 2H2SO3 → Ca(HSO3)2 + CO2 + H2O

So, the process starts with sulfur (S) reacting with O2 to form SO2. Then, SO2 reacts with water to form H2SO3. Finally, CaCO3 (limestone) reacts with H2SO3 to produce Ca(HSO3)2, CO2, and H2O.

Wait, but for part (a), the question is about the amount of sulfur needed when 250 kg of CaCO3 is used. So, I think I need to find the stoichiometric relationship between CaCO3 and S.

Looking at the third reaction: CaCO3 + 2H2SO3 → Ca(HSO3)2 + CO2 + H2O.

So, 1 mole of CaCO3 reacts with 2 moles of H2SO3. But where does H2SO3 come from? From the second reaction: SO2 + H2O → H2SO3. So, 1 mole of SO2 gives 1 mole of H2SO3. And SO2 is made from S and O2 in the first reaction: S + O2 → SO2.

So, the overall process is S → SO2 → H2SO3 → reacts with CaCO3.

Let me break it down step by step.

First, the third reaction: 1 mole CaCO3 → 1 mole Ca(HSO3)2. So, the CaCO3 is used to produce the calcium bisulfite.

But to get H2SO3, we need SO2, which comes from S.

So, starting from S:

Each mole of S produces 1 mole of SO2 (from reaction 1). Each mole of SO2 produces 1 mole of H2SO3 (reaction 2). And each mole of H2SO3 is needed for 0.5 moles of CaCO3, because in reaction 3, 2 moles H2SO3 react with 1 mole CaCO3. So, for 1 mole CaCO3, we need 2 moles H2SO3, which comes from 2 moles SO2, which comes from 2 moles S.

Wait, let me write the stoichiometry:

From reaction 3: 1 CaCO3 + 2 H2SO3 → 1 Ca(HSO3)2 + others.

Each H2SO3 comes from reaction 2: 1 SO2 + H2O → 1 H2SO3.

Each SO2 comes from reaction 1: 1 S + O2 → 1 SO2.

So, for each mole of CaCO3, we need 2 moles of H2SO3. Each H2SO3 requires 1 mole SO2, which in turn requires 1 mole S.

So, per mole CaCO3: 2 moles H2SO3 → 2 moles SO2 → 2 moles S.

So, the ratio is 1 mole CaCO3 : 2 moles S.

Therefore, the amount of S needed is twice the amount of CaCO3 used, in moles.

But wait, let me check the molar masses to calculate the actual mass.

Molar masses:

CaCO3: Ca is ~40, C is 12, O3 is 16*3=48. So 40+12+48=100 g/mol.

Sulfur (S): atomic weight ~32.07 g/mol.

So, for 250 kg of CaCO3, which is 250,000 grams.

Moles of CaCO3 = 250,000 g / 100 g/mol = 2500 moles.

From the ratio, 2500 moles CaCO3 require 2*2500 = 5000 moles of S.

Mass of S = 5000 moles * 32.07 g/mol.

Let me calculate that: 5000 *32.07 = 160,350 grams, which is 160.35 kg.

Wait, but looking at the options, the sulfur amounts are around 120-220 kg. Hmm, 160 kg is option F (160 kg) for part (a). But let me double-check my calculations because 160.35 kg is approximately 160 kg.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the stoichiometry. Let's go through it again.

Reaction 3: 1 CaCO3 + 2 H2SO3 → products.

Each H2SO3 comes from 1 SO2. So 2 H2SO3 = 2 SO2.

Each SO2 comes from 1 S. So 2 SO2 → 2 S.

So, 1 CaCO3 requires 2 S.

So, moles CaCO3 = 250 kg / 100 g/mol = 2500 mol.

Moles S = 2 * 2500 = 5000 mol.

Mass S = 5000 *32.07 = 160,350 g = 160.35 kg.

Looking at the options, option F for part (a) is 160 kg of sulfur. So that's correct for part (a).

Now part (b): What weight of Ca(HSO3)2 is produced from the limestone and sulfur in part (a)?

From reaction 3, 1 mole CaCO3 produces 1 mole Ca(HSO3)2. So, moles of Ca(HSO3)2 = 2500 mol.

Molar mass of Ca(HSO3)2.

Let me calculate that:

Ca: 40.

Each HSO3^- group: H (1) + S (32.07) + O3 (48) = 1 +32.07 +48 = 81.07 g/mol. But since it's Ca(HSO3)2, it's 2*(HSO3^-) so 2 *81.07 = 162.14.

Plus Ca: 40. So total is 40 + 162.14 = 202.14 g/mol.

So, 2500 moles *202.14 g/mol = ?

Let me compute that:

2500 *200 = 500,000.

2500 *2.14 = 5,350.

So total is 500,000 +5,350 = 505,350 grams, which is 505.35 kg.

Looking at the options, option F for part (b) is 505 kg of Ca(HSO3)2. So, that matches.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss any steps. Because sometimes in these problems, there might be other reactions or ratios I missed.

But in this case, the third reaction directly shows that each mole of CaCO3 produces one mole of Ca(HSO3)2. So, yes, 2500 moles of CaCO3 produce 2500 moles of Ca(HSO3)2, which is 505.35 kg.

So putting it together, part (a) is 160 kg S, part (b) is 505 kg Ca(HSO3)2. So the correct option is F: 160 kg of sulfur, 505 kg of Ca(HSO3)2.
</think>

For part (a), the stoichiometric ratio shows that 1 mole of CaCO3 requires 2 moles of sulfur. Given 250 kg of CaCO3, which is 2500 moles, we need 5000 moles of sulfur, corresponding to 160.35 kg. For part (b), each mole of CaCO3 produces 1 mole of Ca(HSO3)2, resulting in 2500 moles or 505.35 kg. 

The correct answer is:

F: 160 kg of sulfur, 505 kg of Ca(HSO3)2.
