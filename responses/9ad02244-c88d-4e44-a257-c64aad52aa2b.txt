Question:

After a wife found out about her husband's infidelity, she decided to have him killed. The defendant approached a hit man to solicit his assistance in carrying out the planned murder. Although the wife believed that he was a hit man, he was, in fact, an undercover agent. The wife told the undercovr agent she would pay him $20,000 if he accepted the job and an additional $20,000 after the killing was completed. Upon hearing the wife's proposal, the undercover agent told the wife he would kill her husband. However, the undercover agent secretly intended not to go through with the plan, and he merely feigned agreement because he wished to trap the wife. The wife told the undercover agent that she would deliver the first payment the next day. However, before making the initial payment, the wife learned that the hit man was really an undercover agent. Fearful that she might be prosecuted for planning her husband's murder, the wife contacted the police and renounced her participation in the criminal endeavor. The defendant will most likely be found

Options:

Okay, so I've got this law question here, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let's break it down step by step. 

The scenario is about a wife who wants her husband killed because he was unfaithful. She approaches someone she thinks is a hit man, but it's actually an undercover agent. She offers $20k upfront and another $20k after the job. The undercover agent agrees but has no intention of going through with it; he's just trying to trap her. 

Then, before she can make the first payment, she finds out he's an undercover agent and renounces her plan, contacting the police. The question is about whether she's guilty of any crimes, specifically solicitation and conspiracy.

First, I need to remember the elements of solicitation and conspiracy. Solicitation typically involves offering a reward or inducement to someone to commit a crime. Conspiracy requires an agreement between two or more people to commit a crime, along with an intent to follow through.

In this case, the wife approached the undercover agent, thinking he was a hit man. She offered money, which is an inducement, so that could be solicitation. But wait, does it matter that the person she approached was actually an undercover agent? I think so. Because if the person isn't actually going to commit the crime, does that affect her liability?

As for conspiracy, she would need to have agreed with someone to commit murder. But since the undercover agent didn't intend to go through with it, maybe that affects the conspiracy charge. I'm a bit fuzzy on whether the other person's intent matters for conspiracy. I think for conspiracy, it's about the agreement and the intent of the person soliciting, not necessarily the other person's intent. So if she intended for her husband to be killed and the undercover agent agreed (even if he didn't plan to do it), maybe that's enough for conspiracy.

Wait, but she later renounced her participation and contacted the police. Does that affect her liability? I remember something about renunciation being a defense, but only if it's done before any further steps. In this case, she renounced before making the payment, which is early in the process. I think if someone renounces their intent to commit a crime and takes affirmative steps to prevent it, like contacting authorities, they might be able to avoid charges. But does that apply to both solicitation and conspiracy?

So, for solicitation: she offered money to someone she thought was a hit man. Even though he was an undercover agent, she had the intent to solicit murder. So she might be guilty of solicitation. But if she renounced before any action, does that negate it? Maybe not, because solicitation is about the offer, not the completion.

For conspiracy: she agreed with the undercover agent to commit murder. The fact that he didn't intend to carry it out might not matter because conspiracy doesn't require both parties to intend the crime; it's about the agreement and the intent of the solicitor. So she intended the murder, and they had an agreement, so conspiracy might hold.

But wait, what about the fact that the agent was undercover? Does that change anything? I think the law treats it the same whether the person is a real hit man or an undercover agent. The solicitor's belief that the person is capable of committing the crime is enough for solicitation.

Now, regarding renunciation: if she renounced before any further steps, would that negate the conspiracy? I think renunciation can be a defense to conspiracy if it's done before the crime is attempted and the person takes affirmative steps to prevent it. So she contacted the police, which is an affirmative step. That might mean she can avoid conspiracy charges.

But wait, does that apply to both conspiracy and solicitation? Solicitation is about the offer. She made the offer, so maybe she's still guilty of solicitation, even if she later renounces. Because solicitation is completed upon the offer, regardless of whether the crime is actually committed.

So, putting it together: she's guilty of solicitation because she offered to pay someone to commit murder. As for conspiracy, she may not be guilty because she renounced before any further steps and took action to prevent it. Therefore, she's guilty of solicitation but not conspiracy.

Looking at the options:

A: Not guilty of either. No, because she did offer to solicit.

B: Not guilty due to lack of intent. No, she definitely had intent.

C: Attempted murder. Doesn't seem right; she didn't attempt it herself.

D: Guilty of both. Maybe, but I think she can avoid conspiracy.

E: Not guilty due to renouncing. Maybe, but only for conspiracy, not solicitation.

F: Guilty of solicitation. That fits.

G: Conspiracy and attempted murder. No, she didn't attempt.

H: Not guilty of conspiracy, guilty of solicitation. Yes, this seems right.

I: Attempted murder and solicitation. No, she didn't attempt.

J: Conspiracy only. No, because she can avoid conspiracy.

So the answer should be H: not guilty of conspiracy, but guilty of solicitation.

The wife approached an undercover agent believing him to be a hit man, offering payment for the murder of her husband. She intended to solicit the crime, meeting the elements of solicitation by offering an inducement. Her belief that the agent was a genuine hit man is irrelevant to her liability for solicitation, as the offer itself constitutes the crime.

Regarding conspiracy, she agreed with the undercover agent to commit murder. However, conspiracy typically requires an agreement and intent to commit the crime. While the agent's lack of intent may not negate her conspiracy charge, her subsequent renunciation of participation and contact with the police before any further action could serve as a defense. Renunciation, if sincere and followed by affirmative steps to prevent the crime, can negate conspiracy charges.

For solicitation, the offer was completed upon the proposal, making her guilty regardless of renunciation. Therefore, she is guilty of solicitation but not conspiracy.
