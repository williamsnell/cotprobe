Question:

John divided his souvenir hat pins into two piles. The two piles had an equal number of pins. He gave his brother one-half of one-third of one pile. John had 66 pins left. How many pins did John originally have?

B: 72
C: 44
D: 60
E: 108
F: 48
G: 66
H: 36
I: 80
J: 90

Okay, let's try to solve this problem step by step. So, John has souvenir hat pins that he divided into two equal piles. That means if the total number is, say, N, each pile has N/2 pins. 

He gave his brother one-half of one-third of one pile. Let me break that down. First, take one pile, which is N/2 pins. Then, one-third of that pile would be (1/3)*(N/2) = N/6. Then, he gave his brother half of that one-third. So, that's (1/2)*(N/6) = N/12. 

Wait, so he gave N/12 pins to his brother. Now, how many pins does John have left? He started with two piles, each N/2. He took one pile and gave away N/12 from it. So, the remaining pins are:

The untouched pile is still N/2. The other pile after giving away N/12 is (N/2 - N/12). Let me calculate that. 

First, N/2 is the same as 6N/12, right? So, subtracting N/12 from that gives 5N/12. So, the total pins left are 6N/12 (untouched pile) plus 5N/12 (the pile after giving away) equals 11N/12.

Wait, but the problem says he has 66 pins left. So, 11N/12 = 66. To find N, I can set up the equation:

11N/12 = 66

Multiply both sides by 12: 11N = 792

Then divide by 11: N = 72.

Hmm, so John originally had 72 pins. Let me check if that makes sense.

If N is 72, each pile is 36. He gave his brother half of one-third of one pile. So, one-third of 36 is 12, and half of that is 6. So, he gave 6 pins away. 

The untouched pile is still 36. The other pile after giving away 6 is 30. Total pins left are 36 + 30 = 66, which matches the problem statement. 

So, the correct answer should be 72, which is option B.

John divided his pins into two equal piles, each of size N/2. He gave away (1/2)(1/3)(N/2) = N/12 pins. The remaining pins are N/2 + (N/2 - N/12) = 11N/12. Setting 11N/12 = 66, we solve to find N = 72.

Answer: B
