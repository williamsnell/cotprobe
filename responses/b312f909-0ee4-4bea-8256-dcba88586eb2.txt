Question:

Why might a researcher use a variable ratio of reinforcement rather than a fixed ratio?

Options:

A: Fixed ratio schedules of reinforcements are more time intensive.
B: Fixed ratio schedules of reinforcement allow for easier data collection.
C: Variable ratio schedules of reinforcement are less effective but easier to implement.
D: Variable ratio schedules of reinforcements avoid problems such as generalization and the Premack principle.
E: Variable ratio schedules of reinforcements are less susceptible to habituation.
F: Fixed ratio schedules of reinforcement are less predictable, thus more effective.
G: Fixed ratio schedules of reinforcement are more resistant to extinction than variable schedules.
H: Variable ratio schedules of reinforcement are more resistant to extinction than fixed schedules.
I: Variable ratio schedules of reinforcements produce results more quickly.

Alright, so I'm trying to figure out this question about reinforcement schedules. The question is asking why a researcher might choose a variable ratio of reinforcement over a fixed ratio. The options are from A to I, and I need to pick the correct one.

First, I remember that reinforcement schedules are types of operant conditioning. There are different schedules like fixed ratio (FR), variable ratio (VR), fixed interval (FI), and variable interval (VI). Each has different effects on behavior.

Fixed ratio means reinforcement is given after a specific number of responses. For example, every 5th correct answer gets a reward. Variable ratio means the number of responses needed for reinforcement varies; like a slot machine where you don't know when you'll get a payout.

I think about why someone would choose one over the other. Fixed ratio can lead to a steady response rate because the person knows how many more they need. But variable ratio is known for producing high and consistent response rates, especially in gambling. Also, variable ratio schedules are harder to extinguish because the person keeps waiting for the next reinforcement.

Wait, extinction is when the behavior stops because reinforcement stops. So if a schedule is more resistant to extinction, it means the behavior continues longer without reinforcement. I remember that variable ratio schedules are more resistant to extinction than fixed ratio. That's because with FR, once the reinforcement stops, the person knows exactly when they won't get it next, so they might stop sooner. Whereas with VR, there's always a chance the next response could get a reward, so they keep going longer.

Looking at the options:

Option H says, "Variable ratio schedules of reinforcements are more resistant to extinction than fixed schedules." That sounds correct based on what I was thinking.

Option G says the opposite, that FR is more resistant, which I think is wrong because VR is actually more resistant.

Other options: A says fixed ratio is more time-intensive. I'm not sure about that. Maybe it's not the main reason. B talks about data collection being easier with FR, which might be true, but the question is about why use VR instead.

C says VR is less effective but easier to implement. No, VR is actually very effective, especially in maintaining high response rates.

D mentions avoiding generalization and Premack principle. I don't think that's related. The Premack principle is about using preferred activities to reinforce others, not directly related to reinforcement schedules.

E says VR is less susceptible to habituation. Habituation is about getting used to something and responding less, but I'm not sure if that's the main point here.

F says FR is less predictable and thus more effective. That doesn't make sense because FR is predictable, and VR is less so. But effectiveness isn't just about predictability.

I says VR produces results more quickly. I'm not certain. I think VR might maintain behavior better over time rather than producing quick results.

So the main point is about resistance to extinction. Therefore, the correct answer should be H.

The correct answer is H because variable ratio schedules are more resistant to extinction than fixed ratio schedules, making them preferable in scenarios where maintaining consistent behavior over time is important.
