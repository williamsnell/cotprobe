Okay, so I've got this question about stock valuation, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. I remember from my studies that when trying to find the fair value of a stock, there are different models you can use. The question mentions that the dividends grow at 20% for the next four years and then settle down to a constant 8% growth rate. The current dividend is $12 in 2016, and the expected rate of return is 15%. So I think I'll need to use the dividend discount model, probably a two-stage model because there are two different growth phases: high and then constant.

Wait, right. The two-stage dividend discount model. It's used when the company's growth is expected to change over time. So, the first part is the high growth period, and the second is the stable growth period.

Let me break it down. The formula for the first part, where the dividend grows at 20% each year for four years, would involve calculating the dividends for each of those four years and then discounting them back to the present value. The second part uses the Gordon Growth Model for the perpetuity starting after year four.

First, I'll calculate the dividends for the first four years.

Dividend in year 1: 12 * (1 + 0.20) = 14.40
Year 2: 14.40 * 1.20 = 17.28
Year 3: 17.28 * 1.20 = 20.736
Year 4: 20.736 * 1.20 = 24.8832

Now, each of these dividends needs to be discounted back to the present value at the required rate of return, which is 15%. So I'll discount each of these four years.

The present value (PV) calculation for each year is:

PV = Dividend * (1 / (1 + r)^n)

Where r is 15%, and n is the year number.

For Year 1:
PV1 = 14.40 / (1.15)^1 = 14.40 / 1.15 ≈ 12.5217

Year 2:
PV2 = 17.28 / (1.15)^2. Let's calculate 1.15 squared: 1.15 *1.15 = 1.3225. So 17.28 / 1.3225 ≈ 13.044

Year 3:
PV3 = 20.736 / (1.15)^3. 1.15^3 is about 1.520875. So 20.736 /1.520875 ≈ 13.625

Year 4:
PV4 = 24.8832 / (1.15)^4. 1.15^4 is approximately 1.749006. So 24.8832 /1.749006 ≈ 14.235

Now, sum these PVs for the first four years: 12.5217 +13.044 +13.625 +14.235 = Let's add them step by step.

12.5217 +13.044 is 25.5657. Then +13.625 is 39.1907. Then +14.235 gives 53.4257. So the present value of the first four dividends is approximately $53.4257.

Next, I need to calculate the value of the stock after year 4, which is at the end of year 4. At that point, the dividend will grow at 8% forever. The formula for that is the Gordon Growth Model, which is P = D5 / (r - g), where D5 is the dividend at year 5, r is the required rate, and g is the growth rate.

What's D5? Well, D4 was 24.8832. So D5 = 24.8832 * 1.08. Let me compute that: 24.8832 * 1.08 = 26.793216.

So P (year 4) = 26.793216 / (0.15 - 0.08) = 26.793216 / 0.07 ≈ 382.7602.

Now, I need to discount this back to the present value. That is, divide by (1.15)^4, which we've already calculated as approximately 1.749006. So PV of P4 is 382.7602 / 1.749006 ≈ 219.74.

Wait, let me double-check that division. 382.76 divided by 1.749006.

Hmm, 1.749 * 219 = 383 approximately. So approximately 219.74.

Now, adding the two parts together: the first four years' PVs are about $53.4257, and the P4's PV is about $219.74. So total fair value is 53.4257 + 219.74 = 273.1657.

Looking at the options, option F is 273.0 and option G is 260.0. So 273.1657 is approximately 273.2, which is option F.

Wait, but let me recheck my calculations to be sure.

Wait, what's the correct calculation for the dividend at year 4? Let me confirm that step.

Year 1: 12 * 1.2 =14.4
Year 2: 14.4 *1.2 =17.28
Year3: 17.28*1.2 =20.736
Year4:20.736*1.2= 24.8832. So that's correct.

PV1 =14.40 /1.15 =12.5217
PV2 =17.28 / (1.15^2) =17.28 / 1.3225 =13.044
PV3=20.736 / (1.15)^3 =20.736 /1.520875 ≈13.625
PV4=24.8832 / (1.15)^4. 1.15^4 is 1.15*1.15=1.3225, then *1.15=1.520875, then *1.15=1.749006. So yes, 24.8832 /1.749006 ≈14.235. So the sum is 12.5217+13.044=25.5657; +13.625=39.1907; +14.235=53.4257.

Then P4 is 26.793216 / 0.07=382.7602. Divided by 1.749006 is approximately 219.74.

So 53.4257 +219.74≈273.1657. So about 273.17. Looking at the options, the closest is F:273.0.

But wait, let me make sure about the exact calculation for each step to avoid any approximation errors.

Let me recompute the PVs more accurately.

Year 1: 14.40 /1.15 = 14.40 ÷ 1.15. 1.15 *12.5 =14.375. So 14.4 is 12.5 + (0.025/1.15) = 12.5 + 0.0217 ≈12.5217. So that's correct.

Year 2:17.28 / (1.15)^2. 1.15^2=1.3225. 17.28 / 1.3225.

Let me compute 1.3225 *13 = 17.1925. So 17.28 is 17.1925 +0.0875. So 13 + (0.0875 /1.3225)=13 + ~0.066=13.066. So 13.066.

Year3:20.736 / (1.15)^3=20.736/1.520875.

1.520875 *13=19.771375. So 20.736 -19.771375=0.964625 left. So 13 + 0.964625/1.520875 = 13 + ~0.6346 =13.6346.

Year4:24.8832 / (1.15)^4=24.8832 /1.749006.

Let me compute 1.749006 *14=24.486. So 24.8832 -24.486=0.3972 left. So 14 + 0.3972/1.749006=14+ ~0.2277=14.2277.

So the four PVs are approximately:

12.5217, 13.066, 13.6346, 14.2277.

Adding them: 12.5217 +13.066=25.5877 +13.6346=39.2223 +14.2277=53.45.

So the first part is about $53.45.

Now, the P4 is 26.793216 / (0.07)=382.7602.

Divide by 1.749006: 382.7602 /1.749006.

Compute 1.749006 *219= 1.749006 *200=349.8012, 1.749006 *19=33.231114. Total=349.8012+33.231114=383.0323. So 1.749006 *219=383.0323. Our P4 is 382.76, which is slightly less. So 219 - (0.27)/1.749006 ≈219 -0.1545≈218.8455.

So approximately 218.85.

So the total fair value is 53.45 + 218.85=272.30. Rounded to two decimal places, $272.30.

Looking at the options, F is 273.0, which is the closest. So I think the correct answer is F:273.0.

To determine the fair value of the stock using the two-stage dividend discount model, we calculate the present value of the dividends for the first four years and the perpetuity value starting from year 5, then sum these values.

### Step 1: Calculate Dividends for Years 1-4
- **Year 1:** \( D_1 = 12 \times 1.20 = 14.40 \)
- **Year 2:** \( D_2 = 14.40 \times 1.20 = 17.28 \)
- **Year 3:** \( D_3 = 17.28 \times 1.20 = 20.736 \)
- **Year 4:** \( D_4 = 20.736 \times 1.20 = 24.8832 \)

### Step 2: Calculate Present Values of Dividends (Years 1-4)
- **Year 1:** \( PV_1 = \frac{14.40}{1.15} = 12.5217 \)
- **Year 2:** \( PV_2 = \frac{17.28}{(1.15)^2} = 13.044 \)
- **Year 3:** \( PV_3 = \frac{20.736}{(1.15)^3} = 13.625 \)
- **Year 4:** \( PV_4 = \frac{24.8832}{(1.15)^4} = 14.235 \)

**Sum of PVs for Years 1-4:**  
\( 12.5217 + 13.044 + 13.625 + 14.235 = 53.4257 \)

### Step 3: Calculate Dividend at Year 5 and Perpetuity Value
- **Dividend at Year 5:** \( D_5 = D_4 \times 1.08 = 24.8832 \times 1.08 = 26.793216 \)
- **Perpetuity Value (P4):**  
  Using the Gordon Growth Model:  
  \( P_4 = \frac{D_5}{r - g} = \frac{26.793216}{0.15 - 0.08} = \frac{26.793216}{0.07} = 382.7602 \)

### Step 4: Calculate Present Value of P4
- **PV of P4:**  
  \( PV_{P4} = \frac{382.7602}{(1.15)^4} = \frac{382.7602}{1.749006} \approx 219.74 \)

### Step 5: Calculate Total Fair Value
- Total Fair Value:  
  \( 53.4257 + 219.74 = 273.1657 \)

### Step 6: Match with Options
The closest option to $273.17 is **F: 273.0**.
