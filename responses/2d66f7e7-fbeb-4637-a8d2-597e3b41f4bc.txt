Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two bicycle tires and their rolling friction coefficients. Hmm, let me try to break this down. I'm a bit rusty on rolling friction, but I remember it's related to the force that opposes motion when a tire rolls. 

The problem states that two tires are set rolling with the same initial speed of 3.5 m/s. Each travels a certain distance before their speed is reduced by half. One tire is at 40 psi and goes 18.1 m, the other at 105 psi and goes 92.9 m. I need to find the coefficient of rolling friction for each. The options are A to J, each with two numbers, so the first number is for 40 psi, the second for 105 psi.

I think the key here is to use the work-energy principle. The work done by the friction force will reduce the kinetic energy of the tires until their speed is halved. Since the initial speed is the same for both, but the distances are different, the friction forces must be different because the tires have different pressures.

Wait, rolling friction force is usually given by F_friction = μ * N, where N is the normal force. Since the tires are on a flat road, N should be equal to the weight of the tire. But wait, I'm not sure if the pressure affects the normal force. Oh wait, pressure in tires relates to the contact area. Higher pressure means less contact area, so maybe N is proportional to pressure? Or is it the opposite?

Wait, no. The normal force N is the force exerted by the road on the tire, which should be equal to the weight of the bicycle and rider, but if the tires are the same except for pressure, perhaps the weight is the same. Wait, but wait, maybe the area changes with pressure. If the pressure is higher, the contact area is smaller. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the normal force is the same for both tires because the weight (mass) of the bicycle is the same, so N = mg is the same. Hmm, but that doesn't seem right because pressure would affect the contact area, but if mass is same, N is same. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, the problem says "the net horizontal force is due to rolling friction only." So F_friction is μN, and N is the normal force. Since the road is flat, N equals the weight, which I'll assume is the same for both tires. So N is same for both. So F_friction = μ*N. So for each tire, F_friction is μ*N, but since N is same, the frictional force is proportional to μ.

Wait, but if the tire is inflated to a higher pressure, does that affect the normal force? I think higher pressure reduces the contact area, so maybe N = mg is the same, but contact area is smaller. Wait, but if the mass of the bike is the same, N would be same regardless of tire pressure. So maybe the normal force is the same for both. So F_friction is μ*N, same N for both. So if μ is different, F_friction is different.

Wait, but if F_friction is μN, and N is same, then F_friction is same for both if μ is same. But in this problem, the two tires have different distances, so F_friction must be different. That suggests that μ is different for each tire.

Wait, but why would μ depend on tire pressure? I'm not sure. Maybe the coefficient of friction μ is given by some function of the tire pressure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the normal force is different because of the tire pressure.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the normal force N is proportional to the tire pressure. Because higher pressure would mean the tire is harder, so maybe the deformation is less, and N might be different. But I'm not entirely certain.

Alternatively, perhaps N is the same, because the bike's weight is the same, so F_friction is μ*N, which would be same if μ is same. But in this problem, the tires have different μ, so F_friction would be different.

Wait, but I think I'm getting ahead of myself. Let me approach this systematically.

The problem is asking for the coefficient of rolling friction, μ, for each tire. So each tire will have its own μ.

We can model the situation using the work-energy principle. The work done by the friction force will equal the change in kinetic energy.

The initial kinetic energy is (1/2)mv². The final kinetic energy is (1/2)m*(v/2)^2 = (1/2)m*(v²/4) = (1/8)mv². So the change in kinetic energy is ΔKE = KE_final - KE_initial = (1/8)mv² - (1/2)mv² = (-3/8)mv². The work done by friction is negative and equals the change in KE, so W = F_friction * d = ΔKE = -3/8 mv².

But F_friction is the rolling friction force, which is μ*N. So:

F_friction * d = -3/8 mv².

But N is the normal force, which is mg. So F_friction = μ mg.

Substituting:

μ mg * d = (-3/8) mv².

The mass m cancels out:

μ g d = (-3/8) v².

But since we're dealing with magnitudes, we can ignore the negative sign.

So rearranged:

μ = (3 v²) / (8 g d).

Wait, wait, because F_friction * d = -ΔKE, so:

F_friction * d = (3/8) mv².

Wait, maybe I should redo the signs.

The work done by friction is W = F_friction * d * cos(theta), where theta is the angle between F_friction and displacement. Since friction is opposite to displacement, theta is 180 degrees, so cos(theta) is -1. So W = -F_friction * d.

The change in KE is KE_final - KE_initial = (1/2 m (v/2)^2) - (1/2 m v^2) )= (1/8 mv²) - (1/2 mv²) = (-3/8 mv²).

So W = ΔKE → -F_friction * d = -3/8 mv² → F_friction * d = 3/8 mv².

So F_friction = (3 mv²)/(8 d).

But F_friction is μ N. N is mg. So:

μ mg = (3 mv²)/(8 d).

Mass m cancels. So:

μ = (3 v²)/(8 g d).

Okay, that's the formula I get. Now, I can compute μ for each tire.

Given:

v = 3.5 m/s same for both.

d is 18.1 m for 40 psi, and 92.9 m for 105 psi.

g is 9.81 m/s².

Plugging in the numbers for each tire.

First, for the 40 psi tire, d =18.1 m.

μ = (3*(3.5)^2)/(8 *9.81 *18.1).

Let me compute this step by step.

3.5 squared is 12.25.

Multiply by 3: 3 *12.25 = 36.75.

Denominator: 8 *9.81 = 78.48; 78.48 *18.1 ≈ let's calculate 78 *18=1404, 78.48 *18.1.

Wait, better to calculate exactly.

78.48 * 18.1 = ?

Let me compute 78.48 * 18 = 1412.64

Then 78.48 *0.1 = 7.848.

Total is 1412.64 +7.848 = 1420.488.

So denominator is 1420.488.

μ =36.75 / 1420.488 ≈ let's compute this division.

36.75 ÷ 1420.488 ≈

Well, 1420 is about 1400, 36.75 ÷1400 ≈ 0.02625.

But let's be precise.

1420.488 × 0.025 = 35.5122.

But 36.75 is a bit more than 35.5122. The difference is 36.75 -35.5122=1.2378.

So 1.2378 /1420.488 ≈ approx 0.00087.

So total μ ≈0.025 + 0.00087=0.02587, approximately 0.0259.

So for the 40 psi tire, μ is about 0.0259.

Now for the 105 psi tire, d=92.9 m.

Using the same formula:

μ = (3*(3.5)^2)/(8*9.81*92.9).

Compute numerator: 3*(3.5)^2=36.75.

Denominator:8 *9.81 =78.48; 78.48 *92.9.

Calculate 78.48 *90=7063.2, 78.48 *2.9=227.592. So total is 7063.2 +227.592=7290.792.

So denominator is 7290.792.

μ=36.75 /7290.792 ≈ let's compute.

36.75 ÷7290.792 ≈

Well, 7290 is about 7300. 36.75 ÷7300 ≈ 0.005034.

But let's be precise.

7290.792 ×0.005=36.45396.

Which is a bit less than 36.75. The difference is 36.75 -36.45396=0.29604.

So 0.29604 /7290.792 ≈ approx 0.0000406.

So total μ≈0.005 +0.0000406≈0.0050406, about 0.00504.

So the two μ's are approximately 0.0259 and 0.00504.

Looking at the options, option D is [0.0259, 0.00505], which matches closely.

Wait, but wait, let me check my calculations again. Because when I computed 36.75/7290.792, perhaps I made an error.

Wait, 36.75 ÷7290.792.

Let me compute 36.75 ÷7290.792.

Well, 7290.792 × 5 = 36453.96, which is way larger than 36.75, so 36.75 is about 5 parts per 10000.

Wait, 7290.792 × 0.005 is 36.45396, as I had before. So 36.75 is 36.45396 +0.29604.

0.29604 /7290.792 ≈ 0.29604 /7290.792 ≈ approx 4.065e-5.

So total μ ≈0.005 +0.0000406=0.0050406, which is approximately 0.00504.

Looking back at the options:

Option D: [0.0259, 0.00505]

So the first μ is 0.0259, second is 0.00505. Which matches our calculations.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because higher pressure usually leads to lower rolling resistance, which would mean a lower μ. So the 105 psi tire should have a lower μ than the 40 psi one. Which is what we have here: 0.0259 and 0.00505. So that makes sense.

Thus, the correct answer is option D.

The problem involves determining the coefficient of rolling friction (μ) for two bicycle tires with different pressures (40 psi and 105 psi) using the work-energy principle. The tires are set rolling with the same initial speed (3.5 m/s) and travel different distances before their speed is halved. The work done by rolling friction is equated to the change in kinetic energy to derive the formula for μ:

\[
\mu = \frac{3v^2}{8gd}
\]

where \(v = 3.5 \, \text{m/s}\), \(g = 9.81 \, \text{m/s}^2\), and \(d\) is the distance traveled by each tire.

For the 40 psi tire (\(d = 18.1 \, \text{m}\)):

\[
\mu = \frac{3(3.5)^2}{8(9.81)(18.1)} = \frac{36.75}{1420.488} \approx 0.0259
\]

For the 105 psi tire (\(d = 92.9 \, \text{m}\)):

\[
\mu = \frac{3(3.5)^2}{8(9.81)(92.9)} = \frac{36.75}{7290.792} \approx 0.00505
\]

The results show that the 40 psi tire has a higher μ (0.0259) than the 105 psi tire (0.00505), which aligns with the expectation that higher tire pressure reduces rolling friction. Comparing these values to the options provided, the correct match is:

**D: [0.0259, 0.00505]**
