Okay, so I've got this probability problem here. Let's try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow and see if I can figure it out.

Alright, the problem says that X is uniformly distributed over the set {1, 2, ..., m}, and m is equal to 2^n. So, m is a power of 2, which might be important later on. We're asking random questions like, "Is X in S₁?" "Is X in S₂?", and so on until only one integer remains. All possible subsets S₁, S₂, etc., are equally likely. So each question is a random subset, right?

We're asked to determine the probability of error (which is having one or more wrong objects remaining) when we ask n + sqrt(n) random questions. And we need to use Markov's inequality to find this probability as n goes to infinity.

Hmm, okay. Let me think about the setup. Since X is uniformly distributed, each element has an equal chance of being the correct one. Initially, there are m possibilities, each with probability 1/m.

Each question is a subset S_i, and the answer is "yes" if X is in S_i and "no" otherwise. These subsets are all equally likely, so each S_i is a random subset, each with probability 1/(2^m) of being any particular subset. Wait, no, actually, the question says all 2^m subsets are equally likely. So each subset S_i is chosen uniformly at random from all possible subsets of {1, 2, ..., m}.

Wait, but each question is a subset, and each subset is equally likely. So each S_i is an independent uniform random subset. So each element j in {1, ..., m} has a 50% chance of being in S_i, because each subset is equally likely, so each element is included with probability 1/2.

So each question gives a bit of information about X. If we ask n + sqrt(n) questions, we can model the process as each question partitioning the set of possible candidates for X.

Wait, but when you ask a question "Is X in S_i?", the answer will either eliminate some candidates or not. But since the subsets are random, the information gained each time is probabilistic.

Wait, maybe we can model this as each question being a random partitioning of the remaining possible candidates. Let me think about it. Initially, there's m=2^n possible values. Each question, on average, might split the remaining candidates into two roughly equal parts, but since the subsets are random, the split isn't perfectly balanced every time.

So after k questions, the number of remaining candidates could be roughly m / 2^k, but with some variance because the splits aren't perfect.

Wait, but in this problem, we're not necessarily getting a perfect split each time. Instead, each question has a 50% chance of including X, and each question is independent.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to model the number of candidates remaining after k questions. Let me denote Y_k as the number of candidates remaining after k questions.

Initially, Y_0 = m. After each question, each candidate has a certain probability of being eliminated. Wait, no, because each question is a subset, and the answer is whether X is in that subset. So for each candidate j (which is a possible value of X), if j is in S_i, then if the answer is "yes", that doesn't necessarily eliminate any candidates because X could be any of the ones in S_i. Similarly, if the answer is "no", then all candidates in S_i are eliminated, but since X is not in S_i, so all j in S_i are excluded.

Wait, no, wait. Let me clarify. Suppose the true X is some value, say x. Then when we ask if X is in S_i, the answer is "yes" if x is in S_i, and "no" otherwise. But for each candidate j, if j is in S_i, then whether the answer is "yes" or "no" depends on whether x is in S_i. But since we don't know x yet, the process is to iteratively eliminate candidates based on the answers.

Wait, maybe I'm complicating it. Let me think differently. Each time we ask a question, the answer will be either "yes" or "no", and each candidate j will be eliminated if, for some question, the answer is "no" and j is in S_i, or "yes" and j is not in S_i. Wait, no, that's not right. Because the answer is "yes" if X is in S_i. So for a candidate j, if j is in S_i, and the answer is "no", then j can be eliminated because X cannot be j. Similarly, if j is not in S_i, and the answer is "yes", then j can be eliminated because X is in S_i, so j isn't. Wait, that's correct. So each question can eliminate some candidates based on the answer.

Wait, so for each question, half the candidates are in S_i and half are not, on average. So if the answer is "yes", then all the candidates not in S_i are eliminated. Similarly, if the answer is "no", then all the candidates in S_i are eliminated.

Wait, but since each S_i is a random subset, the number of candidates eliminated depends on the answer. For example, if I ask a question, and the answer is "yes", then the number of candidates remaining is equal to the number of candidates not in S_i. Since each S_i includes each element with probability 1/2, the expected number of candidates remaining after the first question is m * (1/2), which is m/2.

Similarly, after the second question, the expected number would be m/2 * (1/2) = m/4, and so on. So after k questions, the expected number of candidates remaining is m / 2^k.

Wait, but the problem is that each S_i is a random subset, but the answers are dependent on X. So each question is not independent in terms of the information, but the process of elimination is a bit more involved.

Wait, but maybe the expected number of candidates remaining after k questions is indeed m / 2^k. Because each question, on average, halves the number of candidates. So for each question, the expected number is halved, leading to E[Y_k] = m / 2^k.

So in our problem, we're asking k = n + sqrt(n) questions. So E[Y_{n + sqrt(n)}] = m / 2^{n + sqrt(n)}.

But m is 2^n, so substituting that in, E[Y] = 2^n / 2^{n + sqrt(n)} } = 1 / 2^{sqrt(n)}.

So the expected number of candidates remaining is 1 / 2^{sqrt(n)}, which tends to zero as n approaches infinity because sqrt(n) grows without bound, making 2^{sqrt(n)} very large.

Now, we're interested in the probability that there is an error, which is the probability that one or more wrong objects remain. Wait, but wait, the correct object is X, so the error is when there's more than one candidate left, right? Because if there's more than one candidate left, we haven't narrowed it down to exactly X, so that's an error.

Wait, no, the problem says "one or more wrong objects remaining." Hmm, maybe the error occurs if after the questions, the set of candidates includes at least one wrong object, i.e., the correct X is not the only one left. So the error is when Y_k >= 2, because that would mean there's more than one candidate, implying that X isn't uniquely identified.

So the probability of error is P(Y_k >= 2). We can use Markov's inequality to bound this probability.

Markov's inequality states that for a non-negative random variable Y and for any epsilon > 0, P(Y >= epsilon) <= E[Y]/epsilon.

In our case, Y_k is the number of candidates remaining. We can set epsilon = 2, so P(Y_k >= 2) <= E[Y_k]/2.

We already found that E[Y_k] = 1 / 2^{sqrt(n)}, so P(Y_k >=2) <= (1 / 2^{sqrt(n)}) / 2 = 1/(2^{sqrt(n)+1}).

As n approaches infinity, 2^{sqrt(n)} grows exponentially, so 1/(2^{sqrt(n)+1}) approaches zero. Therefore, the probability of error approaches zero as n goes to infinity.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check. Because if E[Y_k] is approaching zero, that means the expected number of candidates is approaching zero. But can the probability of Y_k being at least 2 also approach zero? I think so, because as the expectation goes to zero, the probability that Y_k is large (like >=2) must also go to zero.

Alternatively, maybe using a different approach. Let's model Y_k as a random variable representing the number of candidates remaining. The expectation E[Y_k] is m / 2^k, which we've calculated as 1 / 2^{sqrt(n)}.

We can use Markov's inequality to get an upper bound on P(Y_k >= 1). Wait, but what we need is P(Y_k >=2). Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to model the probability that Y_k is at least 1, but that's not exactly what we need. Wait, no, because the problem is about the error when one or more wrong objects remain. So if Y_k is 1, that's correct; if Y_k >=2, that's an error.

Wait, but perhaps I should model the probability that Y_k >= 1, which would be 1, because Y_k can't be zero. Wait, no, because Y_k is the number of candidates remaining, so it's at least 1 (since X is always in the candidates). Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps I should think of it differently. The error occurs when after k questions, we haven't narrowed down to exactly X. So the error is when Y_k > 1. So P(Y_k >1) is the probability of error.

We can use Markov's inequality on Y_k. Let's set a =1, then P(Y_k >=1) <= E[Y_k]/1. But E[Y_k] = 1/2^{sqrt(n)} which tends to zero. But P(Y_k >=1) is 1, because Y_k is at least 1. That doesn't help. So perhaps instead, we can use Markov's inequality on Y_k -1, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps we can model the number of incorrect candidates remaining. Let me define Z_k as the number of incorrect candidates remaining. Then the total number of candidates Y_k = 1 + Z_k, where 1 is the correct candidate X. So Z_k is the number of wrong candidates remaining.

Then, the error occurs when Z_k >=1, so P(Z_k >=1) is the probability of error.

We can find E[Z_k]. Since each incorrect candidate j has some probability of surviving k questions. Let's compute the probability that a particular incorrect candidate j remains after k questions.

Wait, for a particular j != X, what's the probability that j is not eliminated after k questions? Well, each question can potentially eliminate j if the answer to that question would indicate that j is not X.

Wait, but each question is a subset S_i, and the answer is "yes" if X is in S_i. For j != X, the answer is "yes" only if X is in S_i, which is a 1/2 chance, since X is uniformly distributed and each S_i is a random subset. Wait, no, that's not correct. Because each S_i is a random subset, but for a fixed j and X, whether j is in S_i is independent of X. Wait, no, because S_i is chosen uniformly, so for each i, the probability that j is in S_i is 1/2, independent of everything else.

Wait, but for a particular j, the process of elimination is such that j will be eliminated if, for any question where j is in S_i, the answer is "no", because that indicates X is not in S_i, so X can't be j. Similarly, j will be eliminated if, for any question where j is not in S_i, the answer is "yes", because that indicates X is in S_i, so X can't be j.

Wait, but for j != X, the answers to the questions are all about X. So for each question S_i, the answer is "yes" if X is in S_i, else "no". So for j != X, whether j is in S_i or not doesn't affect the answer. The answer is determined by X's membership in S_i.

Wait, but for j != X, the answer to each question is "yes" or "no" based on X's inclusion in S_i, not j's. So for j, the process is that after each question, if j is in S_i and the answer is "no", then j is eliminated. Or if j is not in S_i and the answer is "yes", then j is eliminated.

Wait, so for j to survive k questions, it must not be eliminated in any of the k questions. So for each question i, j is not eliminated only if either:

1. j is in S_i and the answer is "yes" (so X is in S_i, so j could be X, but since j != X, this doesn't eliminate j? Wait, no, because if j is in S_i and the answer is "yes", that means X is in S_i, so X could be j or another element in S_i. So j isn't necessarily eliminated in this case.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused again. Let me think: for j != X, what is the condition for j to be eliminated after a question?

If j is in S_i, and the answer is "no" (meaning X is not in S_i), then j is eliminated because X can't be j (since X is not in S_i, and j is in S_i).

Similarly, if j is not in S_i, and the answer is "yes" (meaning X is in S_i), then j is eliminated because X is in S_i, so X can't be j.

So for j to survive k questions, for each i from 1 to k, either:

- j is not in S_i and the answer is "no" (so X is not in S_i), or
- j is in S_i and the answer is "yes" (so X is in S_i).

But since j != X, the answer being "yes" when j is in S_i doesn't necessarily eliminate j, because X could be another element in S_i.

Wait, no, because if j is in S_i and the answer is "yes", that means X is in S_i, but X could be j or any other element in S_i. So j isn't eliminated in this case because X could still be j. So j can only be eliminated in one of two scenarios: either j is in S_i and the answer is "no", or j is not in S_i and the answer is "yes".

So for each question, the probability that j is not eliminated is the probability that either:

- j is not in S_i and the answer is "no", or
- j is in S_i and the answer is "yes".

But since S_i is a random subset, the probability that j is in S_i is 1/2, and the answer is "yes" with probability 1/2 (since X is in S_i with probability 1/2, independent of j's membership in S_i).

Wait, but actually, the answer is determined by X, so the answer is "yes" if X is in S_i, which is a probability of 1/2, because S_i is a random subset. So for each question i, the probability that j is not eliminated is:

P(j not eliminated in question i) = P(j not in S_i and X not in S_i) + P(j in S_i and X in S_i).

Since X and j are fixed, and S_i is random, the events j in S_i and X in S_i are independent.

So P(j not eliminated) = P(j not in S_i) * P(X not in S_i) + P(j in S_i) * P(X in S_i).

Since P(j in S_i) = 1/2, P(X in S_i) = 1/2, and similarly for their complements.

So P(j not eliminated) = (1/2)(1/2) + (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4 + 1/4 = 1/2.

Wait, that's interesting. So for each question, the probability that j is not eliminated is 1/2.

Therefore, for k questions, the probability that j survives all k questions is (1/2)^k.

Since there are m-1 incorrect candidates (since X is one of m), the expected number of incorrect candidates remaining after k questions is (m-1) * (1/2)^k.

So E[Z_k] = (m-1) * (1/2)^k.

Since m = 2^n, this becomes (2^n - 1) * (1/2)^{n + sqrt(n)} }.

Simplify that:

= (2^n - 1) / 2^{n + sqrt(n)}}
= (2^n / 2^{n + sqrt(n)}) ) - (1 / 2^{n + sqrt(n)})
= 1 / 2^{sqrt(n)} - 1 / 2^{n + sqrt(n)}.

As n approaches infinity, the second term becomes negligible, so E[Z_k] ≈ 1 / 2^{sqrt(n)}.

So the expected number of incorrect candidates is about 1 / 2^{sqrt(n)}, which tends to zero as n grows.

Now, to find P(Z_k >= 1), which is the probability that at least one incorrect candidate remains, we can use Markov's inequality.

Markov's inequality says that P(Z_k >= 1) <= E[Z_k] / 1 = E[Z_k].

So P(Z_k >=1) <= E[Z_k] ≈ 1 / 2^{sqrt(n)}.

As n approaches infinity, 1 / 2^{sqrt(n)} approaches zero. Therefore, the probability of error approaches zero.

Wait, but let me double-check. Because for each incorrect candidate j, the probability that j remains is (1/2)^k. So the expected number is (m-1)(1/2)^k, which is (2^n -1)/2^{n + sqrt(n)} ≈ 1/2^{sqrt(n)}.

So the expectation is going to zero, which implies that the probability that Z_k is at least 1 is also going to zero, because the expectation being small means that the probability of having even one incorrect candidate is small.

Therefore, as n approaches infinity, the probability of error (having one or more incorrect candidates remaining) tends to zero.

Looking at the options, option D is 0.0, which is zero. So the answer should be D.
</think>

The problem involves determining the probability of error when using random subset questions to identify a uniformly distributed integer \( X \) over \( \{1, 2, \ldots, m\} \) with \( m = 2^n \). We ask \( n + \sqrt{n} \) questions and use Markov's inequality to find the error probability as \( n \) grows large.

Each question is a random subset \( S_i \), and the answer reveals whether \( X \) is in \( S_i \). The number of candidates remaining after \( k \) questions is modeled by \( Y_k \), with the expected value \( E[Y_k] = m / 2^k \). For \( k = n + \sqrt{n} \), \( E[Y_k] = 1 / 2^{\sqrt{n}} \), which tends to zero as \( n \) increases. 

The error occurs when \( Y_k \geq 2 \), meaning more than one candidate remains. Using Markov's inequality, \( P(Y_k \geq 2) \leq E[Y_k] / 2 \), which also tends to zero. Thus, the probability of error approaches zero.
