Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a steel rod and some stress and strain calculations. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step. I remember that stress is related to force and area, and strain is about deformation. Let's see.

The problem states: A steel rod is 2.0 meters long, has a cross-sectional area of 0.30 cm². It's hung by one end from a support, and a 550-kg milling machine is hung from the other end. We need to find the stress on the rod and the resulting strain and elongation, with the answer in millimeters.

Wait, the question mentions stress and then strain and elongation, but the options are single values. Maybe the question is asking for elongation only? Or perhaps the options refer to elongation. Let me check the units—it says the unit is mm, so probably elongation.

First, I should probably find the elongation of the rod. To do that, I think I need to use Hooke's Law, which relates stress and strain. The formula I remember is ΔL = (F * L) / (A * E), where F is the force, L is the original length, A is the cross-sectional area, and E is Young's modulus for steel.

Wait, but what's Young's modulus for steel? I think it's around 200 GPa, which is 200 x 10^9 Pa. Let me confirm that. Yeah, steel's Young modulus is approximately 200 GPa.

Now, the force F here is the weight of the milling machine. The mass is 550 kg, so F = m * g, where g is 9.81 m/s². Let me calculate that: 550 * 9.81 = ... 550*9 is 4950, 550*0.81 is about 445.5, so total is approximately 5395.5 N. Let me write that as 5395.5 N for precision.

Next, the cross-sectional area A is given as 0.30 cm². But I need to convert that into m² because the units should be consistent. 1 cm² is 1e-4 m², so 0.30 cm² is 0.30e-4 m², which is 3e-5 m². Wait, no: 0.30 cm² is 0.30 * (1e-2 m)^2. Let me compute that: (1 cm) = 0.01 m, so 1 cm² = (0.01 m)^2 = 1e-4 m². So 0.30 cm² is 0.30 * 1e-4 = 3e-5 m²? Wait, 0.3 *1e-4 is 3e-5? Wait, 0.3 *1e-4 is 3e-5? No, wait: 0.3 *1e-4 is 3e-5? No, 0.3 is 3e-1, so 3e-1 * 1e-4 = 3e-5. So yes, 3e-5 m².

The original length L is 2.0 meters.

Young's modulus E is 200e9 Pa.

Now plug into ΔL = (F * L) / (A * E).

So ΔL = (5395.5 N * 2.0 m) / (3e-5 m² * 200e9 Pa).

Let me calculate the numerator first: 5395.5 * 2 = 10791 N·m.

Denominator: 3e-5 * 200e9 = 3e-5 * 2e11 = 6e6.

So ΔL = 10791 / 6e6. Let me compute that.

10791 ÷ 6e6 = 10791 ÷ 6,000,000 ≈ 0.0017985 meters. To convert to mm, multiply by 1000: 0.0017985 * 1000 ≈ 1.7985 mm.

Looking at the options, the closest is option I: 1.8 mm. So the answer should be I.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

Force: 550 kg *9.81 = 5395.5 N. Correct.

Area: 0.30 cm² = 0.30e-4 m² = 3e-5 m². Correct.

E: 200e9 Pa. Correct.

ΔL = (5395.5 * 2) / (3e-5 * 200e9) = 10791 / (6e6) = 1.7985e-3 m = 1.7985 mm. Rounded to two decimal places, 1.8 mm. So yes, option I.

To determine the elongation of the steel rod, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta L = \frac{F \cdot L}{A \cdot E}
\]

Where:
- \( F = 550 \, \text{kg} \times 9.81 \, \text{m/s}^2 = 5395.5 \, \text{N} \)
- \( L = 2.0 \, \text{m} \)
- \( A = 0.30 \, \text{cm}^2 = 3 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{m}^2 \)
- \( E = 200 \times 10^9 \, \text{Pa} \)

Substituting the values:

\[
\Delta L = \frac{5395.5 \cdot 2.0}{3 \times 10^{-5} \cdot 200 \times 10^9} = \frac{10791}{6 \times 10^6} \approx 0.0017985 \, \text{m} = 1.7985 \, \text{mm}
\]

Rounding to two decimal places, the elongation is approximately \( 1.8 \, \text{mm} \).
