Okay, so I have this question about the three basic methods for measuring and analyzing thresholds. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think through it step by step.

First, I remember that threshold measurement is a key part of psychophysics, which deals with how people perceive stimuli. There are several methods used to determine the point at which a stimulus is just detectable or when a change in stimulus is noticeable.

From what I recall, there are a few main methods. The most commonly discussed ones are the Method of Limits, the Method of Constant Stimuli, and the Method of Adjustment. But wait, the question is asking for three basic methods, so I need to make sure I'm not mixing up the terms.

Let me break it down. The Method of Limits involves presenting a stimulus that starts above the threshold and is gradually decreased until the subject reports they can't detect it. Then the stimulus is increased again to find the upper limit. This is done a few times to get an average. So that's one method.

The Method of Constant Stimuli is where different intensities of a stimulus are presented multiple times in a random order, and the subject responds each time. This method gives a more accurate threshold because it's based on the proportion of correct responses at each level.

The third method I'm trying to remember. Oh, right, the Method of Average Error. This method involves adjusting a stimulus to match a standard, and the errors are averaged over multiple trials. The threshold is determined by the point where the average error crosses zero.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because some sources might refer to other methods like the Method of Minimum Error or others. Let me think about the options given.

Looking at the options, I see option I: Method of Limits, Method of Average Error, Frequency method. Hmm, but I'm not sure about the Frequency method. Alternatively, option J: Method of Limits, Method of Average Error, Method of Maximum Likelihood. Maximum likelihood seems more statistical and not a traditional method.

Option E is Method of Limits, Method of Median Error, Frequency method. Median error doesn't ring a bell as a primary method.

Option F: Method of Limits, Method of Constant Errors, Sequential method. Constant errors don't sound right. I think it's usually called Method of Constant Stimuli.

Option G: Method of Adjustments, Method of Minimum Error, Probability method. Adjustments and minimum error sound familiar, but I'm not certain if these are the standard three.

Wait, the three main methods I learned are:
1. Method of Limits
2. Method of Constant Stimuli
3. Method of Adjustment (which is similar to Method of Average Error or Method of Minimum Error)

But I'm not sure if Adjustment and Average Error are the same. Let me clarify: the Method of Adjustment involves the subject adjusting a stimulus to match a standard, and the errors are recorded, usually leading to the threshold based on where the errors cross zero. The Method of Average Error is similar but perhaps refers to averaging the errors in some way.

Looking back at the options, option I includes Method of Limits, Method of Average Error, and Frequency method. But I'm not sure about the Frequency method. Alternatively, option J has Maximum Likelihood, which I don't think is one of the basic methods.

Option E has Method of Limits, Median Error, and Frequency method. I'm not sure about Median Error either.

Wait, another approach: the three main methods are usually Limits, Constant Stimuli, and Adjustment. So if I look for those terms in the options, do any match?

Looking at the options, I don't see "Method of Constant Stimuli" being paired with others. Let me check each option.

Option B: Method of Constant Stimuli, Right and Wrong Cases, Variability. Right and Wrong Cases sounds like the method of yes/no responses, which is part of the constant stimuli method. But I'm not sure if Variability is a separate method.

Option I: Limits, Average Error, Frequency. So if Average Error is a method, and Limits is one, then what's the third? If the third is Frequency method, I'm not sure that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the three methods are:

1. Method of Limits
2. Method of Constant Stimuli
3. Method of Adjustment (or Average Error)

So looking for an option that includes Limits, Average Error, and another. Option I has those, but what's the third?

Alternatively, maybe the third is the Method of Adjustment, which could be called Method of Minimum Error or something else. Let me check the options again.

Option G: Adjustments, Minimum Error, Probability. So that's two methods I'm considering, but the third is Probability method, which I'm not sure about.

Option I includes Frequency method as the third, which I'm not certain about. Alternatively, perhaps the third method is the Method of Constant Errors, but I think that's not a standard term.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think of the three main methods I've studied. I'm pretty confident about Method of Limits and Method of Constant Stimuli. The third is either Method of Adjustment or something else.

Oh wait, another thought: sometimes the methods are categorized as:

- Absolute threshold methods: like Limits and Adjustment
- Differential threshold methods: like Method of Constant Stimuli

But the question is about three basic methods of measuring thresholds, not necessarily distinguishing between absolute and differential.

Alternatively, perhaps the three are:

1. Method of Limits
2. Method of Constant Stimuli
3. Method of Adjustment

So looking for an option that includes these. Let me check the options.

Option I: Limits, Average Error, Frequency. That's two I'm considering, but the third doesn't match.

Option J: Limits, Average Error, Maximum Likelihood. Maximum Likelihood isn't a standard method in basic psychophysics.

Option E: Limits, Median Error, Frequency. Not sure.

Wait, perhaps the third method is the Method of Adjustment, which is sometimes called the Method of Adjustments. Let me see which option includes that. Option G: Adjustments, Minimum Error, Probability. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the three methods are: Limits, Forced-Choice (which could be Right and Wrong Cases), and something else. But I'm not confident.

Wait, I think I'm overcomplicating this. The most common three methods taught are:

1. Method of Limits
2. Method of Constant Stimuli
3. Method of Adjustment (or Average Error)

So looking for an option that includes all three. Let me check each option.

Option I: Method of Limits, Method of Average Error, Frequency method. So that includes Limits and Average Error, which is the same as Adjustment. But what's the third? Frequency method doesn't ring a bell.

Wait, perhaps the third is the Method of Constant Stimuli. But none of the options include Limits, Average Error, and Constant Stimuli together.

Alternatively, maybe the three methods are Limits, Average Error, and another. Let me think about the options again.

Option J: Limits, Average Error, Maximum Likelihood. I don't think Maximum Likelihood is a method used in threshold measurement.

Option I: Limits, Average Error, Frequency method. So perhaps Frequency method is another name for something else. Or maybe I'm wrong about the third method.

Another angle: perhaps the three methods are:

- Method of Limits
- Method of Constant Stimuli
- Method of Adjustment

If that's the case, then the correct option would have all three. But looking at the options, none have all three. Let me check each option.

Option I: Limits, Average Error, Frequency method. So that's two I'm considering, but the third is different.

Wait, perhaps the third method is the Method of Constant Errors, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's the Method of Median Error, which I don't think is standard.

I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think of what each option includes.

Option I: Method of Limits, Method of Average Error, Frequency method.

Option E: Limits, Median Error, Frequency.

Option J: Limits, Average Error, Maximum Likelihood.

Option B: Constant Stimuli, Right and Wrong, Variability.

Option G: Adjustments, Minimum Error, Probability.

Hmm. Maybe the correct answer is I: Limits, Average Error, Frequency method. But I'm not entirely sure about the Frequency method.

Wait, perhaps the third method is the Method of Adjustment, which is sometimes called the Method of Adjustments or Method of Minimum Error. If that's the case, then none of the options perfectly match except maybe option I if Frequency method is a misnomer.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is I because it includes Limits and Average Error, and perhaps the third method is a less common one, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating and the correct answer is I: Method of Limits, Method of Average Error, and Frequency method.

Wait, another thought: sometimes the methods are grouped as:

1. Method of Limits
2. Method of Constant Stimuli
3. Method of Adjustment (Average Error)

So the correct option would include all three, but none of the options do. So perhaps the answer is I because it includes two of the three, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the third method is the Method of Constant Errors, but I don't think that's a standard term.

Wait, perhaps the answer is I because it includes Method of Limits and Method of Average Error, and the third is Frequency method, which I might have confused with something else.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck, but I think the correct answer is I: Method of Limits, Method of Average Error, Frequency method.
</think>

The question asks about the three basic methods of measuring and analyzing thresholds. The most commonly discussed methods in psychophysics include the Method of Limits, the Method of Constant Stimuli, and the Method of Adjustment (also known as the Method of Average Error or Minimum Error). 

Analyzing the options:

- **Option I**: Includes the Method of Limits, Method of Average Error, and Frequency method. The Method of Limits and Method of Average Error are well-known methods, but the Frequency method is not a standard threshold measurement technique.
- **Option J**: Includes the Method of Limits, Method of Average Error, and Method of Maximum Likelihood. While the first two are correct, Maximum Likelihood is not a traditional threshold method.
- **Option E**: Includes the Method of Limits, Method of Median Error, and Frequency method. Median Error is not a standard method.
- **Option B**: Includes the Method of Constant Stimuli, Right and Wrong Cases, and Variability method. While Method of Constant Stimuli is correct, the others are not standard threshold methods.
- **Option G**: Includes the Method of Adjustments, Method of Minimum Error, and Probability method. Adjustments and Minimum Error are related but not as commonly referenced as the other methods.

Given the analysis, **Option I** is the most plausible because it includes two widely recognized methods (Method of Limits and Method of Average Error), even though the Frequency method is not a standard threshold technique.
