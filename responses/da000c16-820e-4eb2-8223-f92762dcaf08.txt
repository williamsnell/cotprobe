Okay, I'm trying to figure out the correct answer to this patent law question. Let me read through it again. So, the situation is that a patent holder is suing a licensee for patent infringement in federal court. The patent holder thinks a jury would be more sympathetic and wants a jury trial. The question is what the lawyer should do to secure that right.

I remember that in the U.S., the right to a jury trial in civil cases is governed by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Specifically, Rule 38 deals with jury trials. From what I recall, a party has to demand a jury trial in writing. If they don't, they might lose that right.

So, when does a party have to make this demand? I think it's within a certain time after the pleading is closed. I remember something about 14 days, but I'm not sure. Wait, no, maybe it's longer. Let me think. Oh right, I think it's within 30 days after the last pleading is closed. But wait, I'm a bit confused because there are different rules for when you can demand a jury trial.

Wait, another thought: the demand has to be made no later than 14 days after the last pleading is served. Or is it 30 days? I'm getting mixed up. Let me try to remember the exact rule. I think Rule 38(b) says that any party may demand a jury trial by serving the other parties with a written demand—that cannot be withdrawn—no later than 14 days after the last pleading directed to the issue is served.

Wait, no, actually, I think the initial pleading is the complaint, and then the defendant has 14 days to serve an answer or a motion. So, the last pleading would be either the answer or a counterclaim, depending on the case. Then, the demand for jury trial has to be made within 14 days after that.

Looking at the options, let's see. Option J says within 14 days after the complaint was served. That might not be correct because the demand is made after the pleadings are closed, not just after the complaint.

Option D says within 30 days after the close of pleadings. Hmm. Wait, I think the correct time is 14 days after the last pleading is closed. So, the last pleading would be when all the initial pleadings are done, like the complaint and the answer.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me check what each option says. Option J is 14 days after the complaint was served. That's probably too early because the defendant might not have answered yet. Option D is 30 days after the close of pleadings. So, if the pleadings close, say, in 30 days, then the demand has to be within 14 days after that.

Wait, no, the rule is that the demand must be made within 14 days after the last pleading directed to the issue is served. So, if the last pleading is, say, the answer, which is served 14 days after the complaint, then the demand has to be within 14 days after that, which would be 28 days after the complaint. So, the demand must be made by day 28.

Looking at the options, let's see. Option J says 14 days after the complaint is served. That would be too early because the defendant might not have filed their answer yet. So, the correct time is 14 days after the last pleading is closed, which would be the answer. So, the demand must be made within 14 days after that.

Wait, but none of the options directly say that. Let me look again.

Option A: Within 60 days after the close of pleadings. That seems too long.

Option B: At the close of discovery. No, that's way too late because discovery comes after pleadings.

Option C: Submit by email. I don't think that's the method; it's supposed to be in writing, either by filing and serving.

Option D: 30 days after close of pleadings. Hmm, I'm not sure if it's 30 days or 14 days.

Wait, I think I'm mixing up the rules. Let me think again. Rule 38(b) states that the demand must be made within 14 days after the last pleading directed to the issue is served. So, if the last pleading is the answer, and it's served, say, on day 15, then the demand has to be made by day 29.

But looking at the options, none of them say 14 days after the last pleading. So, perhaps the closest is option J, which is 14 days after the complaint was served. But wait, if the last pleading is the answer, which is filed after the complaint, then the 14 days would be after the answer is filed.

Alternatively, maybe option J is correct because the complaint is the first pleading, and the demand must be made within 14 days of the last pleading, which would be the answer. But the options don't have that phrasing.

Wait, another angle: the initial pleading is the complaint. Then, the defendant files an answer. So, the last pleading directed to the issue is the answer. So, the 14 days run from when the answer is served. So, the demand must be made within 14 days after the answer is filed.

So, looking at the options, none directly say that. The options are:

A: 60 days after pleadings close.

B: At close of discovery.

C: Email.

D: 30 days after close.

E: At initial hearing.

F: File complaint excluding jury.

G: Verbal request.

H: Pretrial conference.

I: Include in complaint.

J: 14 days after complaint served.

Wait, option I says to include a jury trial demand in the complaint. That's possible because under Rule 38(b), a party may demand a jury trial by serving a written demand. Alternatively, they can include it in a pleading. So, if the complaint includes the jury demand, that's acceptable.

Wait, yes, I think that's correct. Rule 38(b) says a party may demand a jury trial by (1) serving the other parties with a written demand—no later than 14 days after the last pleading directed to the issue is served—or (2) by filing and serving a demand in accordance with Rule 5(d), which allows for filing a pleading that includes the demand.

So, if the plaintiff includes the jury demand in the complaint, that's acceptable. So, option I says "File and serve a complaint that includes a jury trial demand." That would be correct.

Alternatively, option J is making a demand within 14 days after the complaint is served. But if the plaintiff includes the demand in the complaint, that would be timely.

Wait, but the question says the patent holder asked his lawyer to obtain a jury trial. So, the lawyer needs to make sure the demand is properly filed.

So, if the complaint is being filed, and the lawyer includes the jury demand in the complaint, that would satisfy the requirement. So, option I would be correct.

Alternatively, if the complaint is already filed without the demand, then the lawyer needs to file a separate jury trial demand within 14 days after the last pleading is served. But the question doesn't specify whether the complaint already includes the demand.

But looking at the options, option I is about including it in the complaint, which is correct. So, the lawyer should file and serve a complaint that includes a jury trial demand.

To secure the patent holder's right to a jury trial in a federal patent infringement case, the lawyer must ensure compliance with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 38. Rule 38(b) allows a party to demand a jury trial by either (1) serving a written demand no later than 14 days after the last pleading directed to the issue is served or (2) including the demand in a pleading. 

Option I, which involves filing and serving a complaint that includes a jury trial demand, is the correct approach. This method is timely and effective, as it allows the demand to be included in the initial pleading, ensuring the right to a jury trial is properly asserted.

Answer: I
