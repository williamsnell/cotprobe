Alright, so I've got this question about Cicero and his views on immorality and expediency. I'm a bit rusty on my philosophy, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that Cicero was a Roman philosopher and statesman who was influenced by Stoicism. Stoicism, as I recall, teaches that the universe has a rational order, called Nature, and that virtue is in agreement with this Nature. So, things that are in accord with Nature are good, and things that go against it are bad.

The question is asking about immorality and expediency. Immorality is doing something that's against moral standards, right? So, if immorality is against Nature, that would mean it's repugnant to Nature. Because if Nature is aligned with virtue and the right way of living, then immorality would go against that.

Now, expediency refers to what's convenient or useful, often in a practical sense. But in philosophical terms, especially for Stoics, expediency might not always align with what's morally right. I think Cicero would say that expediency, especially if it's just about what's convenient without considering the moral aspect, might be indifferent to Nature. Because sometimes things can be expedient but not necessarily aligned with the natural order or moral principles.

Looking at the options, I need to find where immorality is repugnant and expediency is indifferent. Let me scan the options:

A: Indifferent; in accord. No, that's the reverse.

B: In accord; indifferent. Hmm, no, because immorality shouldn't be in accord.

C: Both in accord. That can't be right because immorality is wrong.

D: Repugnant; in accord. Wait, that would mean expediency is in accord, but I thought expediency might be indifferent.

Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing things up. Let me think again. If expediency is what's useful, but not necessarily moral, then it's indifferent to Nature. Because Nature (as per Stoicism) is about the rational order, so expediency might not always fit into that order. So, expediency is indifferent.

So, immorality is repugnant, and expediency is indifferent. Looking back at the options, I see option H: indifferent to Nature; repugnant to Nature. Wait, no, that's the other way around. Option H says immorality is indifferent, which isn't right.

Wait, let me check again. Option F: repugnant; indifferent. Yes, that's what I thought. So, immorality is repugnant, expediency is indifferent.

Wait, but looking at the options, option F is "repugnant to Nature; indifferent to Nature." So the first blank is immorality, which is repugnant, and expediency is indifferent. That seems correct.

Wait, but earlier I thought about expediency being indifferent, so F would be the right choice. Let me double-check.

I think I'm getting confused because I might have misread the options. Let me list them again:

A: Indiff; in accord.

B: In accord; indiff.

C: Both in accord.

D: Repugnant; in accord.

E: Beneficial; in accord.

F: Repugnant; indiff.

G: Both repugnant.

H: Indiff; repugnant.

I: Beneficial; repugnant.

J: In accord; repugnant.

So, the correct pairing is immorality is repugnant (so first part is repugnant), expediency is indifferent (so second part is indifferent). So that's option F: repugnant; indifferent.

Wait, but I'm a bit unsure. I thought sometimes expediency could be seen as in accord with Nature, but no, because expediency is more about utility, not necessarily moral alignment. So, yes, F makes sense.
