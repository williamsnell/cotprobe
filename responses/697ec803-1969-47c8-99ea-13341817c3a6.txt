Alright, so I've got this problem here: "What is the sum of all integer solutions to |n| < |n-3| < 9?" Hmm, okay. Let me try to break this down step by step. I'm a bit confused, but I'll take it slow.

First, the problem involves absolute values, which I know can sometimes be tricky because they involve distances on the number line. The expression is two inequalities combined: |n| < |n-3| and |n-3| < 9. So I need to find all integer values of n that satisfy both conditions and then sum them up.

Let me start by understanding each part separately.

First inequality: |n| < |n - 3|

I think this inequality is about the distance of n from 0 being less than the distance of n from 3. So, on the number line, which numbers are closer to 0 than to 3? Hmm, that might be numbers to the left of the midpoint between 0 and 3, which is 1.5. So if n is less than 1.5, it's closer to 0 than to 3. But wait, let me make sure.

Alternatively, I can solve the inequality algebraically. Let's square both sides to eliminate the absolute values because squaring preserves the inequality when both sides are non-negative, which they are here since absolute values are always non-negative.

So, |n| < |n - 3| becomes n² < (n - 3)².

Expanding the right side: (n - 3)² = n² -6n +9.

So the inequality is n² < n² -6n +9.

Subtract n² from both sides: 0 < -6n +9.

Then, rearranging: 6n < 9 → n < 9/6 → n < 1.5.

So yes, n must be less than 1.5. Since we're dealing with integers, that means n can be at most 1. So n ≤ 1.

Wait, but let me check for n=1. Let's plug n=1 into |n| and |n-3|.

|1| =1, |1-3|=2. So 1 < 2, which is true. Good.

For n=2: |2|=2, |2-3|=1. So 2 < 1? No, that's false. So n=2 doesn't satisfy the first inequality.

Similarly, n=0: |0|=0 < |0-3|=3 → 0 <3, which is true.

n=-1: |-1|=1 < |-1-3|=4 → 1 <4, true.

So the first inequality restricts n to be less than 1.5, so integers n ≤1.

Now the second inequality: |n -3| <9.

This means the distance of n from 3 is less than 9, so n must be between -6 and 12, because 3 -9 = -6 and 3 +9=12. So -6 < n <12.

But since n must be an integer, n can be from -5 up to 11, inclusive. Wait, no, wait: if |n-3| <9, then n-3 is between -9 and 9, so n is between -6 and 12, but since n must be an integer, n can be from -6 (if inclusive) up to 11. Wait, let me clarify.

Wait, |n-3| <9 implies that -9 <n-3 <9. Adding 3 to all parts: -6 <n <12. So n can be any integer greater than -6 and less than 12. So n can be -5, -4, ..., 11.

But wait, n has to be an integer, so the possible integer values are from -5 up to 11. Because -6 is excluded (since it's less than or equal to -6), but wait, no: the inequality is strict, so n must be greater than -6 and less than 12. So the integers would be -5, -4, ..., 11.

Wait, but let me check. If n=-6, |n-3|=| -6 -3|=9, which is not less than 9, so n=-6 is excluded. So the smallest integer n is -5, and the largest is 11.

So combining both inequalities, n must satisfy both n <1.5 and n >-6, and n must be integer.

So the possible integer values of n are from -5 up to 1, inclusive.

Wait, because n has to be less than 1.5, so the maximum integer is 1. So n can be -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1.

Wait, let me list them:

n=-5: check both inequalities.

First, |n|=5, |n-3|=|-5-3|=8. 5 <8? Yes.

Second, |n-3|=8 <9? Yes. So n=-5 is valid.

n=-4: |n|=4, |n-3|=7. 4<7 yes. 7<9 yes.

Similarly, n=-3: |n|=3, |n-3|=6. 3<6 yes. 6<9 yes.

n=-2: |n|=2, |n-3|=5. 2<5 yes.

n=-1: |n|=1, |n-3|=4. 1<4 yes.

n=0: |0|=0 < |0-3|=3 yes.

n=1: |1|=1 < |1-3|=2 yes.

n=2: Wait, earlier we saw that n=2 doesn't satisfy the first inequality, so it's excluded.

So the integer solutions are n=-5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1.

Now, the question is the sum of all these integer solutions.

Let me calculate the sum:

-5 + (-4) + (-3) + (-2) + (-1) + 0 + 1.

Let me add them step by step.

Start with -5.

-5 + (-4) = -9.

-9 + (-3) = -12.

-12 + (-2) = -14.

-14 + (-1) = -15.

-15 + 0 = -15.

-15 +1 = -14.

So the sum is -14.

Looking at the options, option F is -14.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check the list of integer solutions.

n=-5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1: that's 7 numbers.

Wait, but when I added them up, I got -14. Let me confirm:

-5 + (-4) = -9.

-9 + (-3) = -12.

-12 + (-2) = -14.

-14 + (-1) = -15.

-15 +0= -15.

-15 +1= -14.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, but wait another thing: in the second inequality, |n-3| <9, so n can be from -5 up to 11. But the first inequality restricts n to be less than 1.5, so n ≤1.

So the integer solutions are indeed from -5 to 1.

Wait, but I think I might have missed something. Let me think again.

Wait, the first inequality is |n| < |n-3|, which as we saw, implies n <1.5. So n can be any integer less than 1.5, which is up to 1.

But the second inequality is |n-3| <9, which gives n > -6 and n <12. So the intersection is n >-6 and n <1.5.

So integer n can be -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1.

Yes, that's correct.

So the sum is -14, which is option F.

The integer solutions are -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, and 1. Their sum is -14.
