Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is about how many gallons of water pass through a human body over 60 years, based on the daily liquid loss. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on unit conversions, but I'll take it step by step.

First, I need to find out how much water is lost each day and then multiply that by the number of days in 60 years. The daily losses are given in liters. Let's add them up.

The data given is:
- Urine: 1.0 L/day
- Sweat: 0.6 L/day
- Fecal matter: 0.1 L/day
- Expired air: 0.4 L/day

Adding these together: 1.0 + 0.6 is 1.6, plus 0.1 makes 1.7, and then adding 0.4 gives a total of 2.1 liters per day.

Wait, that's 2.1 liters lost each day. But I think the body also consumes water, so maybe I should consider the total intake. Oh, but the question states "how many gallons pass through," so perhaps it's just the loss, which would be equal to the intake? Or maybe it's the total water processed, which would include both intake and loss. Hmm, but the data given are the loss amounts, so maybe the total water that passes through would be the sum of all these losses plus the amount drunk, but that's not provided. Wait, no, the question says "assuming these data hold for 60 years," so perhaps these are the losses, implying that the total water processed is more than that. But I'm a bit confused.

Wait, no, maybe it's simpler. The question is asking how many gallons pass through, so perhaps it's the total loss, which is 2.1 liters per day. Because the body is losing that amount each day, so the total over 60 years would be 2.1 L/day multiplied by the number of days in 60 years, which would give the total liters lost. Then convert that to gallons.

So first, calculate the total liters lost in 60 years. Let's compute the number of days in 60 years. Assuming it's 365 days per year, but wait, leap years? Hmm, maybe just approximate with 365 days per year. So 60 years * 365 days/year = 21,900 days.

Then, total liters lost: 2.1 L/day * 21,900 days = let's calculate that. 2 * 21,900 is 43,800, and 0.1 *21,900 is 2,190, so total is 43,800 + 2,190 = 45,990 liters.

Now, convert liters to gallons. I remember that 1 gallon is approximately 3.78541 liters. So to find out how many gallons 45,990 liters is, we divide by 3.78541.

Let me compute that: 45,990 / 3.78541 ≈ ?

Well, 45,990 ÷ 3.78541 ≈ Let's see:

3.78541 * 12,000 = 45,425 liters (since 3.78541 * 10,000 = 37,854.1; 3.78541 * 2,000 = 7,570.82; adding gives 45,424.92).

We have 45,990 liters, which is about 565 liters more than 45,424.92. So 565 / 3.78541 ≈ 149. So total gallons would be approximately 12,000 + 149 ≈ 12,149 gallons.

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is 12,045 gallons, which is close. Hmm, but let me check the exact calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial liters per day. Let me double-check. The given losses are 1.0 + 0.6 + 0.1 + 0.4 = 2.1 L/day. So that's correct.

Total liters over 60 years: 2.1 * 365 * 60. Let me compute that again.

2.1 * 365 = 766.5 liters per year. Multiply by 60: 766.5 * 60 = 45,990 liters. That's correct.

Now, converting to gallons: 45,990 / 3.78541 ≈ ?

Using a calculator approach, 3.78541 goes into 45,990 how many times?

Well, 3.78541 * 12,000 = 45,424.92.

Subtract: 45,990 - 45,424.92 = 565.08 liters.

Now, 565.08 / 3.78541 ≈ 149.07 gallons.

So total is 12,000 + 149.07 ≈ 12,149.07 gallons.

Looking at the options, B is 12,045, which is a bit lower. Hmm, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, maybe I should consider that the body's water is part intake and part output, but the question is asking how much passes through, which would be the total consumed. But the data given are outputs, so perhaps the total water that passes through includes both the input and the output. Wait, but that's not clear. Alternatively, perhaps the question is just asking for the total loss, which is 2.1 L/day, leading to 12,149 gallons.

But looking at the options, option B is 12,045, which is the closest. Alternatively, perhaps the calculation is done with 365 days a year, but perhaps the exact number includes leap years. Wait, 60 years would have about 15 leap years, so 60*365 +15 = 21,915 days. So 2.1 * 21,915 = let's compute that.

2 * 21,915 = 43,830. 0.1 *21,915 = 2,191.5. Total = 45, 830 + 2,191.5 = 46,021.5 liters.

46,021.5 / 3.78541 ≈ ?

3.78541 * 12,000 = 45,424.92.

46,021.5 -45,424.92 = 596.58 liters.

596.58 / 3.78541 ≈ 157.6.

So total gallons ≈12,157.6, which is approximately 12,158 gallons. But none of the options match this exactly. Wait, the options are A: 2.10, B:12,045, C:5.48e4, D:21,900, E:4.60e4, F:8.25e3, G:1.089e4, H:6.12e3, I:9.67e4, J:3.65e5.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me check if the calculation is per day, but maybe the question is about the total water that passes through, which would be more than just the loss.

Wait, no, the question says "how many gallons of water pass through a human being," assuming the data hold. The data given are the amounts lost each day. So perhaps the total is just the sum of these losses over 60 years, which is 2.1 L/day * 21,900 days = 45,990 liters, which is about 12,149 gallons, as I calculated earlier. But the closest option is B:12,045, which is a bit less. Alternatively, perhaps the options are approximated.

Wait, maybe I should calculate 2.1 * 365 = 766.5 L/year. Over 60 years, that's 766.5 *60=45,990 L. Now, 45,990 L divided by 3.78541 L/gallon is approximately 12,149 gallons. But none of the options match exactly. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial total liters. Let me check again.

Wait, 2.1 L/day * 60 years. Wait, 60 years is 60 * 365 = 21,900 days. So 2.1 *21,900 = 45,990 liters. Correct.

Now, 45,990 /3.78541 = 45,990 ÷3.78541 ≈ 12,149 gallons.

Looking at the options, B is 12,045, which is close but not exact. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects us to calculate only the urine, sweat, feces, and expired air, but perhaps I'm missing something else. Wait, maybe the question is considering that the total water intake is more than the loss, but the question is only about the loss. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the total water that passes through, which would be the sum of all inputs and outputs. But since the question only gives the outputs, maybe that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating, and the correct answer is option B:12,045 gallons. But why is my calculation giving 12,149? Maybe I should check the exact division.

Let me compute 45,990 ÷ 3.78541 precisely.

3.78541 * 12,149 = let's see, 3.78541 * 12,000 = 45,424.92. 3.78541 * 149 = let's compute:

3.78541 * 100 = 378.541

3.78541 * 40 = 151.4164

3.78541 * 9 = 34.06869

Adding those: 378.541 + 151.4164 = 529.9574 +34.06869=564.02609

So 3.78541 *149=564.02609

Adding to 45,424.92: 45,424.92 +564.02609=45,988.946 liters.

Which is very close to 45,990 liters, so 12,149 gallons would give about 45,988.946 liters, which is almost 45,990. So the exact value is approximately 12,149 gallons. But the options don't have that. The closest is B:12,045.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial liters per day. Let me recheck: 1.0 +0.6=1.6, +0.1=1.7, +0.4=2.1 liters. Correct.

Hmm. Maybe the question expects us to calculate without considering the leap years, so 60*365=21,900 days. So 2.1 *21,900=45,990 liters.

Then, 45,990 divided by 3.78541 is approximately 12,149 gallons. But the options don't have this. So perhaps the correct option is B:12,045 gallons, but I'm not sure why there's a discrepancy.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering only the water lost, not the total consumed. Alternatively, maybe the options are approximated, and B is the intended answer. Alternatively, perhaps I made a calculation mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the total water that passes through includes both intake and output, but that's not clear. If the intake is, say, 3 liters per day, then the total would be 5 liters per day. But the question doesn't provide intake data, only loss. So I think the initial approach is correct.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the question is asking for the total water that passes through, which would be the sum of all inputs and outputs. But without knowing the intake, we can't calculate that. So perhaps the question is only about the loss, which is 2.1 L/day, leading to 12,149 gallons, which isn't an option. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, looking at the options again, option I is 9.67e4, which is 96,700 gallons, way too high. Option E is 4.60e4, which is 46,000, close to 45,990 liters, but that's in liters, not gallons. So no.

Wait, maybe I should consider that the question is asking for the total water that passes through, which is the sum of all the losses plus the water ingested. But since the question doesn't provide the intake, perhaps it's only the loss. So 2.1 L/day *60 years=45,990 liters, which is approx 12,149 gallons. But none of the options match that exactly. The closest is B:12,045 gallons. Maybe the options have approximated the gallon conversion factor.

Alternatively, perhaps the question wants the total in liters converted to gallons using a different conversion factor. For example, 1 gallon = 3.785 liters, but sometimes approximated as 4 liters for easy calculation. So 45,990 liters divided by 4 is 11,497.5, which is close to option B:12,045, but not exact.

Alternatively, perhaps the question expects us to sum all the loss per day (2.1 L) and multiply by 60 years, then convert to gallons. So 2.1 *60=126 L per year? No, wait, that's incorrect. It's 2.1 L/day. So per year, it's 2.1 *365=766.5 L/year. Over 60 years:766.5 *60=45,990 L.

So 45,990 L /3.78541 L/gallon ≈12,149 gallons. But the options don't have this. So perhaps the intended answer is option B:12,045 gallons, considering possible rounding during calculations.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me try again.

Compute 2.1 L/day * 60 years.

First, compute the number of days:60 *365=21,900 days.

2.1 *21,900=45,990 liters.

Convert liters to gallons:45,990 /3.78541≈12,149.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the correct answer is option B:12,045 gallons, which is approximately 12,045.

Alternatively, perhaps the question expects to calculate using 3.8 liters per gallon as an approximation.

So 45,990 /3.8 ≈12,102.63 gallons, which is still not matching any option. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the total water that passes through, which would be the sum of all the losses plus the water taken in. But since we don't have intake data, perhaps it's only the loss.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the total water processed is more than the loss, but again, without intake data, I can't calculate that.

Wait, perhaps the confusion is that the question is about the total water that passes through the body, which would be the sum of all the losses plus the water consumed. But without knowing the intake, that's impossible to calculate. Therefore, perhaps the question is only about the loss, which is 2.1 L/day, leading to 12,149 gallons, but since that's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the question is in gallons per day, but no, the data is in liters per day.

Wait, reviewing the options again, option B is 12,045 gallons, which is close to my calculation of 12,149. Maybe the options used a slightly different conversion factor, like 3.8 liters per gallon.

If I use 3.8 L/gallon:

45,990 /3.8 ≈12,102.63 gallons, which is still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the question expects us to ignore leap years, but that's already done.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial data is wrong. Let me check the sum again.

1.0 (urine) +0.6 (sweat)+0.1 (feces)+0.4 (expired air)=2.1 L/day. Correct.

Hmm, perhaps the answer is option B:12,045 gallons, given the closest approximation.
</think>

To determine how many gallons of water pass through a human being over 60 years, we start by calculating the total daily water loss, which is the sum of the given losses:

- Urine: 1.0 L/day  
- Sweat: 0.6 L/day  
- Fecal matter: 0.1 L/day  
- Expired air: 0.4 L/day  

Adding these together:  
\[ 1.0 + 0.6 + 0.1 + 0.4 = 2.1 \, \text{L/day} \]

Next, calculate the total number of days in 60 years:  
\[ 60 \, \text{years} \times 365 \, \text{days/year} = 21,900 \, \text{days} \]

Multiply the daily loss by the total number of days to find the total liters lost over 60 years:  
\[ 2.1 \, \text{L/day} \times 21,900 \, \text{days} = 45,990 \, \text{L} \]

Convert liters to gallons using the conversion factor \( 1 \, \text{gallon} = 3.78541 \, \text{L} \):  
\[ \frac{45,990 \, \text{L}}{3.78541 \, \text{L/gallon}} \approx 12,149 \, \text{gallons} \]

Among the provided options, the closest value to this calculation is **12,045 gallons**. While there is a slight discrepancy, this is likely due to rounding or approximations in the conversion factor.
