Okay, so I need to figure out the correct answer to this genetics question. Let's start by understanding what the question is asking. It's about predicting genotypic and phenotypic results from different crosses in garden peas. There are four parts: (a), (b), (c), and (d), each involving different crosses, and I need to choose the option (A to J) that correctly describes the outcomes for all parts.

First, I'll recall some basic genetics principles. Garden peas have simple Mendelian inheritance for traits like height, where 'D' is dominant (tall) and 'd' is recessive (dwarf). A homozygous dominant plant is DD and will always produce tall offspring, while a homozygous dwarf is dd.

Let's tackle each part one by one.

**Part (a): Tall (homozygous dominant) crossed with dwarf (homozygous recessive).**
- The tall parent is DD, and the dwarf is dd.
- When crossed, each parent can only contribute one allele. DD can only give D, and dd can only give d. So all offspring will be Dd.
- Genotypic ratio: All Dd.
- Phenotypic ratio: Since Dd is heterozygous, they will all be tall (since dominant trait is expressed).
- So for part (a), the answer should be all Dd genotypically and all tall phenotypically.

Looking at the options, let's check each:

Option A: (a) All dd, All dwarf. No, because crossing DD with dd gives Dd, not dd. So A is out.

Option B: (a) All DD, All tall. No, because the cross is DD x dd, so offspring are Dd. B is out.

Option C: (a) All dd, All dwarf. Same issue as A. C is out.

Option D: (a) All dd, All dwarf. No, same as above. D is out.

Option E: (a) All Dd, All tall. Yes, this matches. E looks possible so far.

Option F: (a) All Dd, (1/2) tall; (1/2) dwarf. No, because all Dd are tall. F is out.

Option G: (a) All Dd, All tall. Yes, correct. G is possible.

Option H: (a) All Dd, (1/2) tall; (1/2) dwarf. No, same as F. H is out.

Option I: (a) All Dd, All tall. Correct. I is possible.

Option J: (a) All DD, All tall. No, because cross is DD x dd. J is out.

So, from part (a), the correct options are E, G, and I.

**Part (b): The progeny of (a) when self-pollinated.**
- The progeny from (a) are all Dd. When Dd self-pollinates, they undergo a self-fertilization.
- The expected genotypic ratio is DD:Dd:dd = 25%:50%:25%.
- Phenotypically, DD and Dd are tall (dominant), dd is dwarf.
- So, 75% tall (DD and Dd) and 25% dwarf (dd).

Now, let's check the options for part (b).

Looking at each option's (b) description:

Option E: (b) (1/4) DD, (1/2) Dd; (1/4) dd, (3/4) tall; (1/4) dwarf. This matches the 25% DD, 50% Dd, 25% dd, and 75% tall, 25% dwarf. So E's part (b) is correct.

Option G: (b) (1/4) DD, (1/2) Dd; (1/4) dd, (3/4) tall; (1/4) dwarf. Same as E, correct.

Option I: (b) (1/3) DD, (1/3) Dd; (1/3) dd, (2/3) tall; (1/3) dwarf. No, because selfing Dd gives a 25%:50%:25% ratio, not 1/3 each. So I is out.

So now, from parts (a) and (b), only E and G are possible.

**Part (c): The progeny of (a) crossed with a homozygous tall plant.**
- The progeny from (a) are all Dd. Now, crossing Dd with a homozygous tall (DD) plant.
- Each Dd parent can produce D and d gametes (each 50%).
- The DD parent can only produce D gametes.
- So the cross is Dd x DD.
- The possible offspring are:
  - D (from Dd) + D (from DD) → DD
  - d (from Dd) + D (from DD) → Dd
- So the genotypic ratio is 50% DD and 50% Dd.
- Phenotypically, all are tall because both DD and Dd express the dominant trait.

Now check the options for part (c).

Option E: (c) (1/2) DD, (1/2) Dd, All tall. Yes, correct.

Option G: (c) (1/2) DD, (1/2) Dd, All dwarf. No, because they're all tall. So G is out.

So now, only E remains correct for (c).

**Part (d): The progeny of (a) crossed with a dwarf plant.**
- Progeny from (a) are Dd. Now, crossed with a dwarf (dd).
- The cross is Dd x dd.
- Each Dd parent produces D and d gametes (50% each).
- The dd parent produces only d gametes.
- So the possible offspring:
  - D (from Dd) + d (from dd) → Dd (tall)
  - d (from Dd) + d (from dd) → dd (dwarf)
- Genotypic ratio: 50% Dd, 50% dd.
- Phenotypic ratio: 50% tall, 50% dwarf.

Check the options for part (d).

Option E: (d) (1/2) Dd; (1/2) dd, (1/2) tall; (1/2) dwarf. Yes, correct.

So putting it all together:

- (a): All Dd, All tall.
- (b): 25% DD, 50% Dd, 25% dd; 75% tall, 25% dwarf.
- (c): 50% DD, 50% Dd; All tall.
- (d): 50% Dd, 50% dd; 50% tall, 50% dwarf.

Looking at the options, only option E matches all parts.

Wait, but let me double-check. Option E's parts:

(a) All Dd, All tall. Correct.

(b) (1/4) DD, (1/2) Dd; (1/4) dd, (3/4) tall; (1/4) dwarf. Correct.

(c) (1/2) DD, (1/2) Dd, All tall. Correct.

(d) (1/2) Dd; (1/2) dd, (1/2) tall; (1/2) dwarf. Correct.

Yes, so option E is the correct answer.

The correct answer is E.
