Okay, let's try to figure out this tax calculation problem. So, the question is about finding the total tax on a store with an assessed valuation of $6,640. The tax rate is $3.87 per $100, and there's also an additional 2% collector's fee on the tax. Hmm, I need to break this down step by step.

First, I think I should calculate the initial tax before the collector's fee. The tax rate is given as $3.87 per $100 of the assessed value. So, I need to find out how many $100s are in $6,640. To do that, I'll divide 6,640 by 100. Let me see, 6,640 รท 100 equals 66.4. So, there are 66.4 units of $100 in the assessed value.

Next, I'll multiply this number by the tax rate. So, 66.4 multiplied by $3.87. Hmm, let me calculate that. 66 times 3.87 is... let's see, 66 * 3 is 198, 66 * 0.87 is approximately 57.42. Adding those together gives 198 + 57.42 = 255.42. Then, 0.4 * 3.87 is about 1.548. Adding that to 255.42 gives 256.968. So, the initial tax comes out to approximately $256.97 before the collector's fee.

Now, there's an additional 2% collector's fee on this tax amount. So, I need to calculate 2% of $256.97. To find 2%, I can multiply 256.97 by 0.02. Let's do that: 256.97 * 0.02 equals approximately $5.14.

Adding this collector's fee to the initial tax will give the total tax. So, $256.97 + $5.14 equals $262.11. Let me double-check that addition: 256.97 + 5.14. 256 + 5 is 261, and 0.97 + 0.14 is 1.11. So together, it's 261 + 1.11 = 262.11.

Looking at the options provided, option D is $262.11, which matches my calculation. So, I think the correct answer is D.

The tax is calculated by multiplying the assessed valuation by the tax rate per $100, then adding a 2% collector's fee on the tax amount. The total tax is $262.11.

Answer: D
