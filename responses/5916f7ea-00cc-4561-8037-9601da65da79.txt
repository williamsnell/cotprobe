Question:

A traffic accident occurred at a road intersection. A motorcycle, a car, and a truck were involved. The motorcyclist was injured and brought suit against the driver of the car and the driver of the truck. The jury returned a verdict finding that the motorcyclist's injuries were caused by negligence on the part of all three of the parties. The jury assigned 55 percent of the fault for the motorcyclist's injuries to the motorcyclist, 25 percent to the driver of the car, and 20 percent to the driver of the truck. The jury found that the amount of the motorcyclist's injuries was$100,000. The motorcyclist enforces the judgment against the driver of the car and collects $45,000 from the driver of the car. If the driver of the car then brings an action against the driver of the truck for contribution, the driver of the car should

Options:

A: recover $5,000.
B: recover $45,000, the amount he paid to the motorcyclist.
C: recover $35,000.
D: recover $25,000.
E: recover nothing, as he has already collected from the motorcyclist.
F: recover $20,000.
G: recover nothing, because he was more at fault than the driver of the truck.
H: recover $27,000.
I: recover $15,000.
J: recover $30,000.

Okay, so I've got this question about tort law, specifically dealing with comparative negligence and contribution among tortfeasors. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the scenario: there's a traffic accident involving a motorcycle, a car, and a truck. The motorcyclist was injured and sued both the car driver and the truck driver. The jury found all three parties (motorcyclist, car driver, truck driver) were negligent. They assigned 55% fault to the motorcyclist, 25% to the car driver, and 20% to the truck driver. The total injury was $100,000.

The motorcyclist then enforced the judgment against the car driver and collected $45,000. Now, the car driver is suing the truck driver for contribution. The question is, how much can the car driver recover?

Hmm, I remember that in cases where multiple defendants are found liable, each can be held responsible for their proportionate share of the damages. But there's also the issue of contribution, which allows a defendant who has paid more than their share to seek reimbursement from the others.

So, first, let's figure out each party's share. The total damages are $100,000. The motorcyclist is 55% at fault, so their own recovery would be limited by comparative negligence. Wait, but in some jurisdictions, if the plaintiff is more than 50% at fault, they can't recover anything. But here, the motorcyclist was 55%, so under pure comparative negligence, their recovery would be reduced by their percentage. So their actual recovery would be (100% -55%) =45% of $100,000, which is $45,000. That's why the motorcyclist collected $45,000 from the car driver.

Wait, but the car driver was 25% at fault. So their share is 25% of $100,000, which is $25,000. Similarly, the truck driver is 20%, so $20,000.

Now, the motorcyclist collected $45,000 from the car driver, which is exactly the car driver's full share. But the car driver is now suing the truck driver for contribution. Contribution is about sharing the liability proportionally. So each defendant is responsible for their percentage.

Wait, but the car driver paid the full $45,000, which is more than their 25% share. Because 25% of $100k is $25k, but the car driver paid $45k. That doesn't make sense because the motorcyclist's recovery was limited to 45k, but the car driver's share was only 25k. Maybe I'm getting confused here.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of total liability. The motorcyclist's total recovery is $45k (45% of 100k). The car driver's liability is 25%, so $25k, and the truck driver's is $20k. But the motorcyclist collected $45k from the car driver, which is more than the car driver's share. Now, the car driver is seeking contribution from the truck driver.

I think under the doctrine of joint and several liability, each defendant can be held responsible for the entire amount, but in some states, they only have to pay their proportionate share. But I'm not sure if that's the case here.

Wait, but the car driver paid $45k, which is the full amount the motorcyclist was entitled to. But the car driver's proportionate share was only $25k. So the car driver paid more than their share. Now, they can seek contribution from the other defendant (truck driver) for the excess.

So, the car driver paid $45k, which is the motorcyclist's total recovery. The car driver's share was $25k, so they overpaid by $20k ($45k - $25k). Now, the car driver can seek contribution from the truck driver for their proportionate share, which is $20k.

Wait, no. The truck driver's share is $20k. So the car driver can ask the truck driver to pay their $20k, but since the car driver already paid $45k, which includes both their own $25k and the truck's $20k, perhaps the truck driver is liable for $20k, but the car driver can only recover up to what they paid beyond their own share.

Wait, maybe I should think about it this way: the total liability is $100k. The motorcyclist can recover 45% because of their own negligence. So the defendants are jointly responsible for that 45k. The car driver is 25% of 100k, which is $25k, and the truck is 20k. So together, their shares add up to 45k, which matches the motorcyclist's recovery.

So the motorcyclist can recover the full 45k from either or both defendants. The car driver paid the full 45k, so now they can seek contribution from the truck driver for the truck's share, which is 20k.

Wait, but the car driver's own share is 25k. So they paid 45k, which is 25k + 20k. So they can seek 20k from the truck driver as contribution. So the car driver would recover $20k from the truck driver.

But wait, looking at the options, F is $20k. But wait, option F is $20,000. So the answer would be F. But wait, let me make sure.

Alternatively, maybe the contribution is based on the proportionate share. The car driver paid $45k, which is their 25% plus the truck's 20%. So the car driver can recover from the truck driver 20% of the total 100k, which is $20k. So yes, F is the answer.

But wait, another angle: some states allow for contribution only up to the amount paid. So if the car driver paid $45k, and their own share is $25k, they can recover from the other defendant the amount that would reduce their burden to their share. So the truck driver's share is $20k, so the car driver can recover $20k from the truck driver, making their net payment $25k, which is their proportionate share.

So the car driver would be able to recover $20k from the truck driver. So the answer should be F: $20,000.

The car driver can recover $20,000 from the truck driver as contribution, which is the truck driver's proportionate share of the motorcyclist's damages. 

Answer: F
