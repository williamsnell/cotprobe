Okay, so I've got this question here, and I'm trying to figure out who said that "Jurisprudence is the eye of law." The options are A through J, each a different legal thinker. Let me start by breaking this down.

First, I need to remember who these people are and what they're known for. I think I'll go through each option one by one and see if any of them are associated with that quote.

Starting with option A, Pound. Roscoe Pound was an American legal scholar known for his work in sociological jurisprudence. I don't recall him saying that specific quote, but maybe I'm wrong. I'll keep it in mind.

Option B is Austin. John Austin is a big name in legal positivism. He's known for his work on thecommand theory of law, like in "The Province of Jurisprudence Determined." But does he say anything about jurisprudence being the eye of law? I'm not sure, but I don't think so.

Option C is Savigny. Friedrich Carl von Savigny is associated with the historical school of jurisprudence. He emphasized the organic growth of law and the role of the Volkgeist, the spirit of the people. I don't remember that specific quote from him either.

Moving to option D, Hart. H.L.A. Hart is another key figure in legal positivism. He wrote "The Concept of Law." I don't think he made that statement. His focus was more on the structure of legal systems.

Option E is Bentham. Jeremy Bentham is the father of utilitarianism and critical of legal formalism. He was a big influence on legal positivism, but I don't think he's the one who said that quote.

Option F is Dworkin. Ronald Dworkin was a critic of legal positivism and argued for a more interpretive approach to law. His ideas are more about justice and integrity in law, but I don't recall him making that specific statement.

Option G is Blackstone. Sir William Blackstone wrote the influential "Commentaries on the Laws of England." He's more about explaining and describing the law rather than making such a philosophical statement. I don't think he's the one.

Option H is Laski. Harold Laski was a political philosopher and legal theorist. He had many ideas, especially about the social aspects of law, but I'm not sure if he made that quote.

Option I is Kelsen. Hans Kelsen is known for his work on the pure theory of law, emphasizing the formal aspects. I don't think he's associated with that particular saying.

Option J is Maine. Henry Maine is known for his work on the early history of law, like in "Ancient Law." He discussed the transition from status to contract in legal systems. I don't remember him making that quote either.

Wait, maybe I'm missing someone. I think the quote is from someone else. Alternatively, perhaps it's a less-known figure or a translation from another language. Oh, wait! I think I might have heard this quote before. Let me think. There's a German saying that translates to "Jurisprudence is the eye of the law." The original German might be "Das Recht hat ein Auge, die Jurisprudenz, und das Auge ist blind." But I'm not sure about the exact origin.

Wait, another thought: I think it's a quote from a German legal historian. Maybe it's from someone like Rudolph von Jhering? Or perhaps it's a misattribution. Alternatively, maybe it's from someone like Savigny, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps it's from a later thinker.

Wait, another angle: the term "eye of the law" suggests that jurisprudence provides insight or vision into the law. So maybe it's someone who emphasized the interpretative or analytical role of jurisprudence. Hart comes to mind, but I don't think he said that. Or maybe it's from someone like Blackstone, but I don't think so.

Alternatively, perhaps it's from Dworkin. He talked about law as an interpretive concept, but again, not sure about the exact quote. Alternatively, maybe it's from a Latin maxim. Or perhaps it's from someone like Laski, who wrote about the social aspects of law.

Wait, I think I might have heard that quote before. Let me try to recall. I think it's from a German source. Maybe it's from Rudolf von Jhering, a 19th-century legal thinker. He wrote "Die Rechtswissenschaft" and had many quotes. But I'm not sure if he's one of the options here. Looking back, the options are A to J, and J is Maine. So maybe it's not there.

Wait, perhaps it's from someone else. Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is G, Blackstone. Because he's known for his commentaries, but I don't think he said that.

Alternatively, perhaps it's from Savigny, but I can't recall. Alternatively, maybe it's from someone else entirely. Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to think differently.

Another approach: the quote suggests that jurisprudence is the eye, meaning it gives insight or provides the vision for law. So perhaps it's someone who emphasizes the analytical or theoretical aspect of law. Austin, as a legal positivist, focused on the command theory, so maybe not. Hart, as a positivist, perhaps. Alternatively, maybe it's from someone who wrote about the methodology of law.

Wait, I think I've read that the quote is from Rudolf von Jhering, but since he's not an option, perhaps the correct answer is someone else. Alternatively, maybe it's from someone like Maine, but I don't think so.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing it with another quote. Let me think again. The options are A to J, so I need to pick one. I think I've heard that the quote is from someone like Dworkin or perhaps Laski.

Alternatively, maybe it's from Henry Maine. He wrote about the development of law, but I don't recall him making that specific statement.

Alternatively, perhaps it's from someone else. Wait, I think I might have mixed up the quote. Let me check my memory again. I think the actual quote is "Jurisprudence is the eye of the law," and I believe it's from an older thinker. Maybe it's from Blackstone? Or perhaps it's from someone like Savigny.

Wait, I think I might have found it. I believe it's from a German source, and the original quote is "Das Recht hat ein Auge, die Jurisprudenz, und das Auge ist blind." Translated, it means "The law has an eye, jurisprudence, and the eye is blind." But I'm not sure who said that.

Alternatively, perhaps it's from a more modern thinker. Wait, I think I've heard it in the context of Hart's work. But I'm not certain.

Wait, another thought: perhaps it's from Dworkin's work. He often talked about law as an interpretive concept, so maybe he made a similar statement. But I don't recall exactly.

Alternatively, maybe it's from Kelsen, who wrote about the pure theory of law. But again, I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think about each option again. Let me list them:

A: Pound – sociological jurisprudence
B: Austin – command theory
C: Savigny – historical school
D: Hart – concept of law
E: Bentham – utilitarian
F: Dworkin – critical legal theory
G: Blackstone – commentaries
H: Laski – social justice
I: Kelsen – pure theory
J: Maine – Ancient Law

Hmm. Now, I'm trying to think if any of these are known for saying that jurisprudence is the eye. Maybe it's from Savigny, as he's from Germany and perhaps made some philosophical statements about law. Alternatively, perhaps it's from someone else. Wait, I think I've heard that the quote is from Kelsen. Or maybe it's from someone like Laski.

Wait, another angle: perhaps it's from someone who emphasized the importance of theory in law. So, maybe Savigny, who talked about the historical development of law, or perhaps Dworkin, who emphasized interpretation.

Alternatively, maybe it's from Austin, but I don't think so. Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think of any other clues. The quote seems to suggest that jurisprudence provides insight or vision into the law. So, perhaps it's someone who saw the law as being understood through its principles, which is a key aspect of legal theory.

Wait, I think I've read that this quote is from someone like Rudolf von Jhering, but since he's not an option, maybe the answer is not among the options. But the options are given, so I must choose from A to J.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing it with another quote. I think I've heard that "Law is the command of the sovereign," which is Austin. But that's a different quote.

Alternatively, maybe it's from someone who wrote about the structure of law. Hart, for example, in "The Concept of Law," but I don't think he made that specific statement.

Wait, another thought: perhaps it's from someone like Blackstone, who in his commentaries talks about the law as a science, but I don't recall him using that exact wording.

Alternatively, maybe it's from Maine. He wrote about the early history of law, but I don't think he's the one.

Wait, I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to make an educated guess. The quote seems to be about the role of jurisprudence in understanding law, providing insight. Among the options, someone like Hart or Dworkin might have made such a statement, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's from Savigny or Austin.

Wait, I think I've heard that the quote is from Savigny. He might have said something like that in his work. So, perhaps the answer is C: Savigny.

But I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, maybe it's from someone else. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: I think I've heard that the quote is actually from Rudolf von Jhering, but since he's not an option, perhaps the correct answer is someone else. But since the options don't include Jhering, I have to choose from the given list.

Alternatively, perhaps it's from Kelsen. He wrote about the formal aspects, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I should look for the origin. I think the quote is "Das Recht hat ein Auge, die Jurisprudenz, und das Auge ist blind." Translated, it's "The law has an eye, which is jurisprudence, and the eye is blind." I think this is a German saying, but I'm not sure who said it first.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a misattribution, and the actual origin is unknown. But given the options, I have to choose.

Wait, perhaps the answer is G: Blackstone. Because he's known for his commentaries and explaining the law, so maybe he referred to jurisprudence as the eye. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe it's from someone like Dworkin, who emphasized the interpretive aspect.

Wait, I think I've heard that the quote is from Savigny. He might have made that statement in his writings. So, perhaps the answer is C: Savigny.

But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps it's from someone else.

Wait, another thought: maybe it's from someone like Maine, who wrote about the early history of law. But I don't recall that specific quote.

Alternatively, perhaps it's from Laski, who wrote about the social aspects of law.

Wait, I think I'm stuck. I'll have to make a guess. Given that the options are A to J, and considering that the quote is about the insight or vision of law, I think the answer is probably C: Savigny.

The question asks who said that "Jurisprudence is the eye of law." After considering each option and their contributions, the most plausible answer is Savigny, as he is associated with philosophical statements about the law and jurisprudence.

Answer: C
