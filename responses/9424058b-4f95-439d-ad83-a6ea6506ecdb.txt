Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let me read it again carefully.

The question says: A constant horizontal force of 10 N is required to drag an object across a rough surface at a constant speed of 5 m/sec. What power is being expended? How much work would be done in 30 minutes?

Hmm, I remember that power is related to work and time. Oh wait, power is the rate at which work is done. The formula I think is P = F * v, where P is power, F is force, and v is velocity. Right, because power is force multiplied by the speed at which the force is applied.

So first, let's calculate the power. The force here is 10 N, and the velocity is 5 m/s. So plugging into the formula: P = 10 N * 5 m/s = 50 Watts. Okay, that should be the power expended, which is 50 W. 

Now, the second part is about work done in 30 minutes. Work done is calculated as W = F * d, where d is the distance. But wait, how do I find the distance? Oh right, distance is speed multiplied by time. So I need to find how far the object moves in 30 minutes.

First, convert 30 minutes to seconds because the velocity is in m/s. 30 minutes is 30 * 60 = 1800 seconds. Then, distance d = velocity * time = 5 m/s * 1800 s = 9000 meters. 

Now, work W = F * d = 10 N * 9000 m = 90,000 Joules. But wait, the options are given in Watt-hours, right? So I need to convert Joules to Watt-hours because 1 Watt-hour is 3600 Joules. So 90,000 J divided by 3600 equals... let me calculate that.

90,000 / 3600 = 25. So 25 W-hr. 

So putting it together, the power is 50 W, and the work done is 25 W-hr. Now, looking at the options, I see option G is 50 W and 25 W-hr. So that should be the correct choice.

The power is calculated using P = F * v = 10 N * 5 m/s = 50 W. The work done in 30 minutes (1800 seconds) is W = F * d = 10 N * (5 m/s * 1800 s) = 90,000 J, which converts to 25 W-hr. 

Answer: G
