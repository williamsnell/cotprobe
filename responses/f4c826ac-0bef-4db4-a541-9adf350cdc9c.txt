Okay, so I have this question about nucleotide bases and RNA. Hmm, I remember that RNA stands for ribonucleic acid, right? And DNA is deoxyribonucleic acid. They both have nucleotides, which are made up of a sugar, a phosphate group, and a nitrogenous base.

The question is asking which nucleotide base isn't found in RNA. Let's look at the options.

Option A: Deoxyribose. Wait, deoxyribose is the sugar in DNA, not RNA. RNA uses ribose, so deoxyribose isn't a baseâ€”it's a sugar. So A is a sugar, not a base, but the question is about bases, so maybe A isn't the answer. Or does the question count the sugar as part of the nucleotide? Wait, the question says "nucleotide bases," so it's about the bases themselves. So maybe A isn't a base, but a sugar. So perhaps the answer is A because RNA doesn't have deoxyribose as a base.

Option B: Phosphate. Phosphate is part of the nucleotide backbone, not a base. So B is not a base either, but the question is about the base, so B isn't the right answer.

Option C: Cytosine. Cytosine is a pyrimidine base, and I think RNA has cytosine. So C is present.

Option D: Nitrogenous base. That's a general term; all bases are nitrogenous. So D is a category, not a specific base, but the question is about which specific base isn't found. So D is not the answer.

Option E: Uracil. RNA uses uracil instead of thymine, so E is present.

Option F: Thymine. DNA has thymine, and RNA doesn't. So F might be the answer.

Option G: Ribose. Again, that's the sugar in RNA, not a base. So G isn't a base, but the question is about bases, so G isn't the answer.

Option H: Guanine. That's a purine base found in both RNA and DNA, so H is present.

Option I: Pyrimidine. That's a class of bases, including cytosine and uracil. So I is a category, not a specific base, so not the answer.

Option J: Adenine. Another purine base, present in RNA as well.

Wait, so the question is about which base isn't found in RNA. Thymine (F) is the one that's only in DNA, right? Because RNA uses uracil instead. So F is the correct answer.

Wait, but option A is deoxyribose, which is a sugar, not a base. The question is about bases, so the incorrect base would be F, Thymine. So the answer is F.

The question asks which nucleotide base is not found in RNA. RNA is composed of ribose sugar, phosphate groups, and nitrogenous bases. Among the options, thymine is a nucleotide base found in DNA but not in RNA, which instead uses uracil. Deoxyribose is a sugar, not a base, but the question focuses on bases. Therefore, the correct answer is thymine.

Answer: F
