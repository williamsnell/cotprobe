<think>
Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to calculate the standard enthalpy of formation (ΔHf°) for NO(g) at 975 K. The question says to assume that the heat capacities of the reactants and products are constant over the temperature interval at their values at 298.15 K. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through step by step.

First, I remember that the standard enthalpy of formation is the change in enthalpy when one mole of a substance is formed from its elements in their standard states. For NO(g), the reaction would be:

1/2 N2(g) + 1/2 O2(g) → NO(g)

At 298 K, the standard enthalpy of formation of NO is known. I think it's around 90 kJ/mol. But wait, the question is asking for 975 K, which is higher. So I can't just use the value directly; I need to account for the temperature change.

I recall that when the temperature changes, we can use the heat capacities to find the change in enthalpy. The formula for the change in enthalpy due to temperature is:

ΔH = Σ [n * C_p * (T2 - T1)]

Where C_p is the heat capacity at constant pressure, and n is the stoichiometric coefficient.

But wait, this is for a reaction. Since NO is formed from its elements, I think I need to consider the standard enthalpy of formation at 298 K and then adjust it for the temperature change to 975 K.

So, the approach would be:

1. Start with the standard enthalpy of formation at 298 K.
2. Calculate the change in enthalpy for each substance involved when the temperature changes from 298 K to 975 K.
3. Sum these changes appropriately based on their stoichiometric coefficients.
4. Add this total change to the original ΔHf° at 298 K to get the value at 975 K.

Let me jot down the given data. The standard enthalpy of formation of NO at 298 K is approximately 90.4 kJ/mol. Wait, I'm not entirely sure about the exact value, but I think it's around there. Let me check the options: looking at the choices, option E is 91.7 kJ/mol, which is close. But that's at 298 K. Oh wait, no, the question is about 975 K, so I can't just pick E.

Next, I need the heat capacities (Cp) for each substance involved. The reaction is:

1/2 N2 + 1/2 O2 → NO

So the substances are N2, O2, and NO. I think the Cp values at 298 K are needed. I remember that the Cp for N2 is about 29.1 J/mol·K, O2 is around 34.8 J/mol·K, and NO is approximately 44.5 J/mol·K. Let me confirm these values; I might be mixing them up a bit.

Wait, I think the Cp for diatomic gases are as follows:
- N2: 29.1 J/mol·K
- O2: 34.8 J/mol·K
- NO: 44.5 J/mol·K

Yes, that's right. So, each has their specific Cp.

Now, the temperature change is from 298 K to 975 K. So, the ΔT is 975 - 298 = 677 K.

For each substance, I calculate the enthalpy change due to temperature:

ΔH_substance = n * Cp * ΔT

But since the reaction is 1/2 N2 + 1/2 O2 → NO, the coefficients are 1/2 for N2 and O2, and 1 for NO. However, in enthalpy calculations, each substance is considered separately.

Wait, no. I think the correct approach is to calculate the change for each substance involved in the reaction and then sum them up.

So, for the reaction:

1/2 N2: ΔH = (1/2) * Cp(N2) * ΔT
1/2 O2: ΔH = (1/2) * Cp(O2) * ΔT
NO: ΔH = (1) * Cp(NO) * ΔT

But wait, the way the reaction is written, the NO is a product. So when considering the overall enthalpy change due to temperature, I think I need to compute the sum of the enthalpy changes of the products minus the sum of the reactants.

Wait, no, because the standard enthalpy of formation includes the enthalpy change at 298 K, and we're adjusting it for temperature. So perhaps it's better to compute the enthalpy change for each substance from 298 K to 975 K and then apply their stoichiometric coefficients.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to compute the standard enthalpy of formation at 975 K by taking the value at 298 K and adding the enthalpy change due to the temperature change for each substance involved in their standard states.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

The standard enthalpy of formation of NO at 298 K is ΔHf°(NO, 298) = 90.4 kJ/mol (approx).

To find ΔHf°(NO, 975), we can calculate the change in enthalpy due to the temperature change using Cp.

The formula would be:

ΔHf°(NO, 975) = ΔHf°(NO, 298) + [Σ (ν_products * Cp(product) - Σ ν_reactants * Cp(reactant)) ] * ΔT

Wait, no. Because for the formation reaction, the reactants are elements in their standard states. So the reaction is:

1/2 N2(g) + 1/2 O2(g) → NO(g)

So, the change in enthalpy due to temperature would be the sum of the enthalpy changes for each substance multiplied by their stoichiometric coefficients.

Wait, but the enthalpy change for the reaction at constant pressure is ΔH = Σ νΔ Cp ΔT.

So, for each substance in the reaction:

ΔH_rxn due to T change = [ν(NO)*Cp(NO) + ν(N2)*Cp(N2) + ν(O2)*Cp(O2)] * ΔT

But wait, no. Let me think: The general formula is:

ΔH = Σ [ν_products * Cp(product)] - Σ [ν_reactants * Cp(reactant)] ) * ΔT

So in this case:

ν(NO) = 1
ν(N2) = 1/2
ν(O2) = 1/2

So,

ΔH_T = [1*Cp(NO) + (1/2)*Cp(N2) + (1/2)*Cp(O2)] * (975 - 298)

Wait, but wait, when calculating the enthalpy change due to temperature for the reaction, it's the sum of (ν * Cp) for products minus sum for reactants multiplied by ΔT.

Wait, no, I think the correct approach is to compute the enthalpy change for the reaction at constant pressure when each substance's temperature changes. So the formula is:

ΔH_rxn(T2) = ΔH_rxn(T1) + [Σ ν_products Cp(products) - Σ ν_reactants Cp(reactants)] * (T2 - T1)

So, in this case, ΔH_rxn(T1) is ΔHf°(NO, 298) = 90.4 kJ/mol.

We need to find ΔH_rxn at T2=975 K, so:

ΔHf°(NO,975) = 90.4 + [ (1*Cp(NO)) - ( (1/2)*Cp(N2) + (1/2)*Cp(O2) ) ) ] * (975 - 298)

Wait, that makes sense. The term in the brackets is the difference between the sum of products' Cp and reactants' Cp, each multiplied by their stoichiometric coefficients.

Let me compute each term:

Cp values:
N2: 29.1 J/mol·K
O2: 34.8 J/mol·K
NO: 44.5 J/mol·K

So,

Sum for products: 1 * 44.5 = 44.5 J/mol·K
Sum for reactants: (1/2)*29.1 + (1/2)*34.8 = (29.1 +34.8)/2 = 63.9/2 = 31.95 J/mol·K

So the difference is 44.5 - 31.95 = 12.55 J/mol·K

ΔT is 975 - 298 = 677 K

So,

ΔH_T = 12.55 J/mol·K * 677 K = ?

Calculating that:

12.55 * 677 = ?

Let me compute step by step:

12 * 677 = 8,124
0.55 * 677 = approx 372.35
Total = 8,124 + 372.35 = 8,496.35 J/mol, which is 8.496 kJ/mol.

So, the change in enthalpy due to temperature is +8.496 kJ/mol.

Now, the original ΔHf° at 298 K is 90.4 kJ/mol. Adding the temperature change:

90.4 + 8.496 ≈ 98.896 kJ/mol.

Wait, but wait. The options don't have 98.9. Let me check the options again.

Options are:

A: 76.4

B:80.9

C:85.5

D:97.3

E:91.7

F:120.8

G:110.3

H:99.9

I:103.6

J:105.2

Hmm, 98.9 is close to option H:99.9, but perhaps I made a mistake in calculations.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the Cp difference. Let me double-check.

Sum for products: 1 * 44.5 =44.5

Sum for reactants: (1/2)*29.1 + (1/2)*34.8 = 14.55 +17.4=31.95

Difference:44.5 -31.95=12.55 J/mol·K.

Yes, that's correct.

ΔT=677 K.

12.55 * 677 = ?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the multiplication.

Let me compute 12.55 * 677:

12 * 677 = 8,124

0.55 * 677: 0.5*677=338.5, 0.05*677=33.85 → total 338.5 +33.85=372.35

So 8,124 +372.35=8,496.35 J → 8.49635 kJ.

So that's correct.

Adding to 90.4 gives 90.4 +8.496=98.896 kJ/mol.

Looking at the options, the closest is H:99.9 kJ/mol. But perhaps my initial ΔHf° value was incorrect.

Wait, what's the standard enthalpy of formation of NO at 298 K? I thought it was about 90.4 kJ/mol, but perhaps it's different.

Let me recall: I think the standard enthalpy of formation of NO is approximately 90.4 kJ/mol, but I'm not 100% sure. Some sources say it's 90.4, others might have slightly different values.

Alternatively, perhaps the calculation should be done in J instead of kJ to avoid decimal errors.

Wait, let me recalculate the ΔH_T more accurately.

12.55 J/mol·K * 677 K = ?

12.55 * 677:

Calculate 12 * 677 =8,124

0.55 * 677: 0.5*677=338.5; 0.05*677=33.85 → 338.5 +33.85=372.35

Total 8,124 +372.35=8,496.35 J → 8,496.35 J =8.49635 kJ.

So, 8.496 kJ.

Adding to 90.4 gives 98.896 kJ/mol.

But none of the options exactly match that. The closest is H:99.9, but that's off by about 1 kJ. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial ΔHf° value.

Wait, perhaps the standard enthalpy of formation of NO is actually 102.5 kJ/mol? No, I think it's around 90. Let me check another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have used the standard enthalpy of formation at 298 K as 102.5 kJ/mol. Wait, no, that's for something else. I think NO's ΔHf° is indeed about 90.4 kJ/mol.

Wait, maybe I should look up the exact value to make sure. Since I can't look it up, I'll proceed with 90.4.

Wait, perhaps the question assumes that the heat capacities are used for each substance, but I might have miscalculated the Cp difference.

Wait, another way: perhaps the calculation is done per mole of reaction as written.

Wait, the reaction is 1/2 N2 + 1/2 O2 → NO.

So, for each mole of reaction, the change in enthalpy due to temperature is:

ΔH_T = [ (1 * Cp(NO)) - ( (1/2)*Cp(N2) + (1/2)*Cp(O2) ) ) ] * ΔT

Which is what I did earlier.

So, 44.5 - (14.55 +17.4) =12.55 J/mol·K.

So, 12.55 *677=8,496.35 J=8.496 kJ.

So, total ΔHf° at 975 K is 90.4 +8.496≈98.896 kJ/mol.

But the options don't have that. The closest is H:99.9, but that's 1.004 kJ higher. Alternatively, perhaps the initial ΔHf° is 91.7 kJ/mol, which is option E. Let me check.

If ΔHf°(NO,298)=91.7 kJ/mol, then adding 8.496 gives 91.7 +8.496=100.196 kJ/mol. That's even closer to option H:99.9, but it's about 0.3 kJ higher.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the Cp values. Let me double-check the Cp for each gas.

N2: 29.1 J/mol·K (correct)
O2:34.8 J/mol·K (correct)
NO:44.5 J/mol·K (correct)

So the difference is correct.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is written as:

N2 + O2 → 2 NO, but no, the standard formation is for one mole of NO, so it's 1/2 N2 +1/2 O2 → NO.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the enthalpy at 975 K, but considering that the standard enthalpy of formation is for the reaction as written, and the temperature adjustment is for each substance.

Wait, another approach: the standard enthalpy of formation at T2 is equal to the standard enthalpy at T1 plus the sum of (Cp * ΔT) for each substance in the reaction, each multiplied by their stoichiometric coefficients.

So,

ΔHf°(NO, T2) = ΔHf°(NO, T1) + [ (ν(NO) * Cp(NO) ) - (ν(N2)*Cp(N2) + ν(O2)*Cp(O2)) ) ] * (T2 - T1)

Which is exactly what I did.

So, with ΔHf°(NO,298)=90.4 kJ/mol,

ΔHf°(NO,975)=90.4 + (44.5 - (14.55 +17.4)) *677

Which is 90.4 +12.55 *677 J → 90.4 +8,496.35 J → 90.4 +8.496 kJ =98.896 kJ.

Hmm, so the answer should be approximately 98.9 kJ/mol. Looking at the options, H is 99.9, which is close but a bit higher. Alternatively, perhaps the initial ΔHf° is 90.4, and the calculation gives 8.496, so 90.4 +8.496=98.896. But none of the options match exactly.

Wait, perhaps the initial ΔHf° is 102.5 kJ/mol? No, that's for another reaction. I'm pretty sure NO's ΔHf° is around 90.4.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the Cp values. Let me check another source in my mind. Sometimes, Cp values are given in different units or for different conditions.

Wait, perhaps the Cp values are in kJ instead of J. No, that can't be right because 29.1 J is 0.0291 kJ.

Wait, perhaps the Cp values are in kJ/(mol·K), so 29.1 J/(mol·K) is 0.0291 kJ/(mol·K). So, when multiplied by 677 K, it's 0.0291 *677 ≈19.61 kJ/mol for N2, but no, that's per mole of N2.

Wait, no, the calculation was correct because I used J and converted to kJ afterward.

Wait, perhaps I should use the exact value of ΔT. Let me recalculate ΔT: 975 -298=677 K. Correct.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is H:99.9 kJ/mol, but my calculation gives 98.896. Maybe I should check if I made a mistake in the Cp values.

Wait, perhaps the Cp for O2 is 34.8 J/mol·K, which is correct. N2 is 29.1, correct. NO is 44.5, correct.

Wait, another approach: let's compute the exact value.

ΔH_T = (44.5 - (14.55 +17.4)) *677 =12.55 *677=8,496.35 J=8.49635 kJ.

So, adding to 90.4:

90.4 +8.49635=98.89635 kJ/mol.

Looking at the options again:

H:99.9 is the closest, but it's 1.0036 higher. Alternatively, perhaps the given options have a different value for ΔHf° at 298 K. Let me think: if the initial ΔHf° is 91.7 kJ/mol (option E), then:

91.7 +8.496=100.196 kJ. That's closer to H:99.9 but still a bit off.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the calculation.

Wait, 12.55 *677:

Let me compute 12.55 * 677 precisely.

12.55 * 600 =7,530

12.55 *77=965.35

Total:7,530 +965.35=8,495.35 J → 8.49535 kJ.

So, 90.4 +8.49535=98.89535 kJ/mol.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is H:99.9, but it's a bit higher. Alternatively, maybe the Cp values are different.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question expects us to use only the Cp values without considering that the reaction is 1/2 N2 +1/2 O2 → NO. Maybe it's considering the formation of one mole of NO from the elements, but perhaps the calculation is done per mole of NO, so the Cp values are multiplied by 1.

Wait, perhaps the correct way is to calculate the enthalpy change for each substance from 298 to 975 K, then sum them according to their stoichiometric coefficients.

So, for the reaction:

1/2 N2 → 1/2 N2 at 975 K: ΔH = (1/2) * Cp(N2) * ΔT

Similarly for O2 and NO.

Wait, but I think that's the same as what I did before.

Alternatively, perhaps the approach is to compute the enthalpy of each substance at 975 K and then compute the formation enthalpy.

Wait, the standard enthalpy of formation is the sum of the enthalpies of the reactants minus the enthalpy of the product.

So, ΔHf°(NO) = [ (1/2 H(N2)) + (1/2 H(O2)) ] - H(NO)

But I'm not sure if that's the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the standard enthalpy of formation at T2 is:

ΔHf°(NO, T2) = ΔHf°(NO, T1) + [ Cp(NO) - (1/2 Cp(N2) +1/2 Cp(O2)) ] * (T2 - T1)

Which is what I did.

So, unless I'm missing something, the calculation seems correct, but the answer isn't matching the options exactly.

Wait, perhaps the question is using a different value for ΔHf° at 298 K. Let me check the options again. Option E is 91.7, which is close to 90.4. If I use 91.7 as the initial value, then:

91.7 +8.496=100.196 kJ/mol. The closest option is H:99.9, but that's still off by about 0.3 kJ.

Alternatively, perhaps the question expects us to use the standard enthalpy of formation at 298 K as 102.5 kJ/mol. Wait, that can't be right because NO's standard enthalpy of formation is exothermic, around 90 kJ/mol.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the Cp difference. Let me recheck.

Products: 1 mole of NO → Cp=44.5 J/mol·K

Reactants: 1/2 N2 and 1/2 O2 → their Cp contributions are (1/2)*29.1 + (1/2)*34.8 =14.55 +17.4=31.95 J/mol·K

Difference:44.5 -31.95=12.55 J/mol·K.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the question is using the molar heat capacities in kJ instead of J. Let me try that.

If I use Cp values in kJ:

N2: 29.1 J/mol·K =0.0291 kJ/mol·K

O2:34.8 J/mol·K=0.0348 kJ/mol·K

NO:44.5 J/mol·K=0.0445 kJ/mol·K

Then,

Difference=0.0445 - (0.0291*(1/2)+0.0348*(1/2)).

Compute: 0.0291*(0.5)=0.01455; 0.0348*(0.5)=0.0174 → sum=0.01455+0.0174=0.03195.

So, difference=0.0445 -0.03195=0.01255 kJ/mol·K.

ΔT=677 K.

ΔH_T=0.01255 *677=8.49585 kJ/mol.

So, same as before.

So, ΔHf°(NO,975)=ΔHf°(298) +8.49585.

If ΔHf°(298)=90.4, then 90.4+8.49585=98.89585≈98.9 kJ/mol.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct answer is H:99.9, but that's a bit higher. Alternatively, perhaps I should round up to 99 kJ/mol, but none of the options are exactly that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial ΔHf° value. Let me think: if the standard enthalpy of formation of NO is actually 91.7 kJ/mol (option E), then adding 8.496 gives 100.196 kJ/mol. The closest option is H:99.9, which is 0.3 kJ lower. Alternatively, perhaps the Cp values are different.

Wait, perhaps the Cp for NO is 45.5 J/mol·K instead of 44.5. Let me try that.

If NO's Cp is 45.5:

Difference=45.5 -31.95=13.55 J/mol·K.

ΔH_T=13.55 *677=9,170.85 J=9.17085 kJ.

Adding to 90.4:90.4 +9.17085=99.57085≈99.57 kJ/mol.

That's closer to H:99.9. But I think NO's Cp is 44.5, not 45.5.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is written as N2 + O2 → 2 NO, so the stoichiometric coefficients are different.

Wait, let's try that. The reaction as 2 moles of NO:

N2 + O2 → 2 NO

In that case, the stoichiometric coefficients are:

ν(N2)=1, ν(O2)=1, ν(NO)=2.

So, the difference in Cp would be:

Sum for products:2 *44.5=89 J/mol·K

Sum for reactants:1*29.1 +1*34.8=63.9 J/mol·K

Difference:89 -63.9=25.1 J/mol·K.

ΔT=677 K.

ΔH_T=25.1 *677=16,932.7 J=16.9327 kJ.

But this is for 2 moles of NO. So per mole, it's 8.466 kJ.

So, ΔHf°(NO,975)=90.4 +8.466≈98.866 kJ/mol.

Still around the same as before.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe the correct answer is H:99.9, but I can't see why. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, perhaps the standard enthalpy of formation at 975 K is calculated by considering the enthalpy change from each reactant and product from 298 K to 975 K.

So, the reaction is:

1/2 N2(g) + 1/2 O2(g) → NO(g)

The enthalpy at 975 K would be the sum of the enthalpies of the products minus the reactants at 975 K.

So,

ΔHf°(NO,975) = [ H(NO,975) ] - [ (1/2)H(N2,975) + (1/2)H(O2,975) ]

But H(X,975) = H(X,298) + Cp(X) * (975-298)

So,

H(NO,975) = H(NO,298) + Cp(NO)*677

Similarly for N2 and O2.

So,

ΔHf°(NO,975) = [ H(NO,298) + Cp(NO)*677 ] - (1/2)[ H(N2,298) + Cp(N2)*677 ] - (1/2)[ H(O2,298) + Cp(O2)*677 ]

But H(N2,298) is zero because it's an element in standard state. Similarly, H(O2,298)=0.

So,

ΔHf°(NO,975) = [ ΔHf°(NO,298) + Cp(NO)*677 ] - (1/2) [ 0 + Cp(N2)*677 ] - (1/2) [0 + Cp(O2)*677 ]

Simplify:

= ΔHf°(NO,298) + Cp(NO)*677 - (1/2) Cp(N2)*677 - (1/2) Cp(O2)*677

Factor out 677:

= ΔHf°(NO,298) + 677 [ Cp(NO) - (1/2) Cp(N2) - (1/2) Cp(O2) ]

Which is the same as before. So, same result.

So, I think the calculation is correct. But since none of the options match exactly, perhaps the intended answer is H:99.9, considering rounding or a different initial ΔHf° value.

Alternatively, perhaps the question expects the answer to be approximately 99 kJ/mol, which would be H:99.9.

But I'm not entirely confident. Another possibility is that I made a mistake in the Cp values. Let me check another source in my mind. Oh wait, perhaps the Cp for NO is 45.5 J/mol·K, not 44.5.

If Cp(NO)=45.5, then the difference would be 45.5 -31.95=13.55 J/mol·K.

ΔH_T=13.55 *677=9,170.85 J=9.17085 kJ.

Adding to 90.4 gives 99.57085 kJ/mol, which is approximately 99.6 kJ/mol. The closest option is H:99.9 kJ/mol.

So perhaps that's the intended answer.
</think>

To calculate the standard enthalpy of formation (ΔHf°) of NO(g) at 975 K, we start with the known ΔHf° at 298 K and adjust for the temperature change using the heat capacities (Cp) of the reactants and products. The reaction is:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \text{N}_2(g) + \frac{1}{2} \text{O}_2(g) \rightarrow \text{NO}(g)
\]

### Given Data:
- ΔHf°(NO, 298 K) ≈ 90.4 kJ/mol (assumed value).
- Cp values at 298 K:
  - N₂: 29.1 J/mol·K
  - O₂: 34.8 J/mol·K
  - NO: 44.5 J/mol·K
- Temperature change: ΔT = 975 K - 298 K = 677 K.

### Step 1: Calculate the enthalpy change due to temperature
The enthalpy change for the reaction due to temperature is given by:

\[
\Delta H_{\text{T}} = \left[ \nu_{\text{products}} \cdot C_p(\text{products}) - \nu_{\text{reactants}} \cdot C_p(\text{reactants}) \right] \cdot \Delta T
\]

For the reaction:
- ν(NO) = 1
- ν(N₂) = 1/2
- ν(O₂) = 1/2

Substituting the Cp values:
\[
\Delta H_{\text{T}} = \left[ (1 \cdot 44.5) - \left( \frac{1}{2} \cdot 29.1 + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 34.8 \right) \right] \cdot 677
\]

\[
\Delta H_{\text{T}} = \left[ 44.5 - (14.55 + 17.4) \right] \cdot 677
\]

\[
\Delta H_{\text{T}} = \left[ 44.5 - 31.95 \right] \cdot 677 = 12.55 \cdot 677 = 8,496.35 \, \text{J} = 8.496 \, \text{kJ}.
\]

### Step 2: Adjust the standard enthalpy of formation
The standard enthalpy of formation at 975 K is:

\[
\Delta Hf^\circ(\text{NO}, 975 \, \text{K}) = \Delta Hf^\circ(\text{NO}, 298 \, \text{K}) + \Delta H_{\text{T}}
\]

\[
\Delta Hf^\circ(\text{NO}, 975 \, \text{K}) = 90.4 + 8.496 = 98.896 \, \text{kJ/mol}.
\]

### Step 3: Compare with the options
The calculated value of 98.896 kJ/mol is closest to **H: 99.9 kJ/mol**. Minor discrepancies may arise due to rounding or slight variations in the assumed ΔHf° value at 298 K.
