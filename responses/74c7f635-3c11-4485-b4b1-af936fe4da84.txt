Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here about legumes, and I need to figure out which of the options are not legumes. Let's see, the options are A through G: peas, soybeans, peanuts, radishes, lentils, beans, and chickpeas. I remember that legumes are a specific group of plants, so I need to recall what defines them.

First, I think about what legumes are. From what I remember, legumes are plants in the family Fabaceae, which includes a lot of well-known plants. They have pods, right? So any plant that produces pods that split along both sides would be a legume. Examples I can think of include peas, beans, lentils, soybeans, and chickpeas. So those are definitely legumes.

Now, looking at the options, A is peas, which I know are legumes. B is soybeans, also a legume. C is peanutsâ€”I think peanuts are also considered legumes because they have pods. Wait, but wait, aren't peanuts technically groundnuts? No, I think they are still legumes because they belong to the same family. So C is a legume.

Then D is radishes. Radishes are root vegetables, and I don't think they are legumes. They belong to the Brassicaceae family, which includes plants like cabbage and mustard. So radishes are not legumes. That makes D the correct answer to the question "which are not legumes."

E is lentils, which are definitely legumes. F is beans, so that's a legume too. G is chickpeas, which are also known as garbanzo beans, another legume. So the only one that stands out as not a legume is D, radishes.

Wait, but just to make sure, is there any chance that radishes are considered legumes? I don't think so. Legumes are usually the plants that bear pods, and radishes don't have pods; instead, they have a taproot that's eaten. So yeah, D is the one that's not a legume.
