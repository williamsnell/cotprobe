Okay, so I've got this economics question here about expansionary fiscal policy and crowding out. Hmm, I need to figure out when there's more crowding out as a result of such a policy. Let me start by recalling what I know about these concepts.

Expansionary fiscal policy usually involves the government increasing spending or cutting taxes to stimulate the economy. Crowding out, on the other hand, refers to the idea that when the government borrows to finance its spending, it can push up interest rates, which in turn can reduce private investment. So, more crowding out means that the government's actions are causing a bigger displacement of private sector activities.

The question is asking when there's relatively more crowding out due to expansionary fiscal policy. Let's look at the options one by one.

Option A: Central bank pursues contractionary monetary policy. If the central bank is contractionary, they might be raising interest rates or reducing the money supply. This could make borrowing more expensive, which might lead to more crowding out because higher interest rates would discourage private investment. But I'm not sure if this is the main factor here.

Option B: Expansionary monetary policy accompanies fiscal policy. If both fiscal and monetary policies are expansionary, that usually leads to lower interest rates because the central bank is increasing the money supply. Lower rates would mean less crowding out because private investment would be cheaper. So this might actually reduce crowding out, making option B less likely the correct answer.

Option C: Government cuts taxes rather than increasing spending. When the government cuts taxes, it's putting more money into the hands of people and businesses. This might lead to increased consumption and investment. But since it's a tax cut, the government isn't necessarily increasing its own spending. I'm not sure how this affects crowding out directly. Maybe if taxes are cut, there's less need for the government to borrow, so less impact on interest rates. So perhaps this leads to less crowding out.

Option D: Investment demand curve is perfectly inelastic. Perfectly inelastic means that investment doesn't change regardless of interest rates. So if the government's borrowing increases interest rates, but investment doesn't change because the curve is perfectly inelastic, there wouldn't be any crowding out. Therefore, this would mean less crowding out, so D is not the right answer.

Option E: Government spending improves profit expectations among businesses. If government spending makes businesses more optimistic about profits, they might invest more on their own. So, when the government spends and businesses also increase investment, the overall effect might be more output without as much crowding out. So this might actually reduce crowding out, making E less likely.

Option F: Investment demand curve is inelastic. Inelastic means that a change in interest rates leads to a smaller change in investment. So if the government's borrowing causes interest rates to rise, the reduction in private investment would be small. That means more crowding out because the increase in government spending doesn't fully offset the decrease in private investment. Wait, no—elasticity in investment demand: if the curve is inelastic, a given change in interest rates causes a small change in investment. So if interest rates go up, investment goes down a little. That would mean more crowding out because the government's spending is pushing out private investment, but since the curve is inelastic, the effect is smaller. Wait, but the question is about more crowding out. So if the investment demand is less responsive, then the crowding out effect is smaller. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. Elastic means that a small change in interest rates leads to a large change in investment. So if the investment demand is elastic, then an increase in interest rates due to government borrowing would lead to a significant drop in private investment—so more crowding out. So if the investment demand is elastic (option G), that would lead to more crowding out. So option F, where it's inelastic, would mean less crowding out.

Option G: Investment demand curve is elastic. As I thought earlier, elastic investment demand means that a rise in interest rates leads to a large drop in private investment. So when the government increases spending (expansionary fiscal policy), it borrows more, driving up interest rates. If investment is elastic, this leads to a significant reduction in private investment—so more crowding out. Therefore, G seems like a good candidate.

Option H: Economy is in a boom period. During a boom, the economy is overheating, and resources are largely employed. If the government implements expansionary fiscal policy, it might cause excessive demand, leading to higher interest rates and potential crowding out. But I'm not sure if this is the direct cause of more crowding out compared to other options.

Option I: Economy is in a recession. If the economy is in a recession, expansionary fiscal policy is usually implemented to stimulate it. In this case, the private sector might have lower investment anyway because of low confidence. So the impact of government borrowing on interest rates might be less pronounced, leading to less crowding out. Or maybe the opposite—if the economy is weak, the government's spending might not cause as much displacement because private investment is already low. So I'm not sure if this leads to more crowding out.

Option J: Government spending is primarily focused on infrastructure. Infrastructure spending is productive and can have positive externalities. It might actually encourage private investment if it improves the business environment. So this could lead to less crowding out because the government's investment complements private activities rather than competing with them.

So putting it all together, the key factor here is the elasticity of the investment demand curve. If it's elastic (option G), then expansionary fiscal policy will lead to more crowding out because the increase in government spending will push up interest rates, leading to a significant decrease in private investment. Therefore, the correct answer should be G.

The correct answer is when the investment demand curve is elastic because an elastic curve means that a rise in interest rates due to government borrowing leads to a significant drop in private investment, resulting in more crowding out.

Answer: G
