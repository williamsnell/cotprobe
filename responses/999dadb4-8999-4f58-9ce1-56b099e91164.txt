Question:

A father and a son were indicted and charged with bank robbery. They allegedly participated together in robbing a bank in their hometown. After the son was arrested and given Miranda warnings, he confessed and admitted that he and his father took part in the bank robbery. The prosecution decided to charge the father and son in the same indictment and prosecute them together in a single trial. At trial, the son took the stand and recanted his earlier confession by denying participation in the robbery. The prosecution now seeks to introduce into evidence the son's earlier confession that was videotaped by the police. The son and the father both object to its admissibility. The confession should be

Options:

A: admitted against the father only, because the son recanted his confession.
B: not admitted against the son, but admitted against the father as it implicates him in the crime.
C: admitted against both the son and the father, because the son implicated the father in the crime.
D: not admitted against the son or the father, because the son was under duress when he confessed.
E: admitted against the son only, because it is his confession.
F: admitted against both the son and the father, because they were jointly charged.
G: not admitted against the son or the father, because the confession is hearsay not within any recognized exception.
H: not admitted against the son or the father, because the son recanted the confession.
I: admitted against both the son and the father, because they were engaged in a conspiracy.
J: admitted against the son only.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this evidence question about the admissibility of a confession. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the scenario: A father and son are charged with bank robbery. The son was arrested, given Miranda warnings, and confessed, implicating himself and his father. Then, at trial, the son recanted his confession and denied involvement. The prosecution wants to use the videotaped confession against both the father and son.

I remember that confessions can be tricky because of the rules against hearsay and the rights of the accused. Miranda warnings are crucial here because if they're given correctly, any confession is considered voluntary and can be used against the person, right?

So, the son gave a confession after Miranda, so it's admissible against him unless... Well, he later recanted. But can he do that? I think that a defendant can change their story, but their initial confession, if voluntary and made with Miranda, is still admissible as evidence against them. So the son's confession can be used against him, regardless of his later testimony. That would mean option E or J is possible because it's his own confession.

But what about the father? The son's confession mentions the father. Under what circumstances can a co-defendant's confession be used against another defendant? I recall that there's a rule about co-conspirator statements. If two people are part of a conspiracy, then one's statement can be used against the other if it was made during the conspiracy and in furtherance of it. But here, it's a robbery, not necessarily a conspiracy. Or maybe the joint trial implies a conspiracy? Not sure.

Alternatively, there's the Bruton issue. Bruton v. United States deals with the admission of a co-defendant's confession that implicates another defendant when they're tried jointly. If the confession is voluntary and the other defendant isn't testifying, the confession can be admitted, but if the defendant is testifying and the confession is being used against them, there's a risk of a confrontation clause violation, especially if the other defendant doesn't have the chance to cross-examine.

Wait, in this case, the son is testifying and recanting. So if the confession is admitted against the father, that might violate the father's confrontation rights because the son isn't available for cross-examination. But I'm not sure if that applies here since the father is a separate defendant.

Another angle: The confession is hearsay. Hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. The exception for confessions applies when it's the defendant's own statement. So the son's confession is admissible against him as a statement against his penal interest, but what about against the father?

The father wasn't the one confessing, so the statement would be hearsay as to him. Unless there's another exception, like if it's a declaration against interest or something else. But I don't think that applies here. So against the father, the son's confession would be inadmissible hearsay unless an exception applies.

Wait, but if the father and son were part of a conspiracy, then the son's statement could be admissible against the father as a co-conspirator's statement. But to use that exception, the prosecution would have to prove that the two were conspirators at the time the statement was made. The question doesn't mention a conspiracy charge, just a robbery. So maybe that's not applicable.

Alternatively, the statement could be used against the father under the theory that it's a joint venture. But I think that's more about whether the father can be held liable for the son's actions, not about the admissibility of the confession against him.

So, putting it together: The son's confession can be used against him because it's his own statement after Miranda. But against the father, it's hearsay unless there's a specific exception. Since the question doesn't indicate any such exception, it's likely inadmissible against the father.

Wait, but what about the rule against using one defendant's confession against another in a joint trial? The case I remember is Bruton, where a co-defendant's confession was admitted, leading to a confrontation clause issue because the defendant couldn't cross-examine the declarant. But in this case, the son is testifying, so maybe Bruton doesn't apply. Or does it? Because here, the son is on the stand, so the father can cross-examine him about the confession. So Bruton's issue might not be a problem here.

If that's the case, then the confession could be admitted against the father as well because the confrontation clause isn't violated when the declarant is present and testifies. But wait, the son is the declarant, and he's testifying. So the father can cross-examine him about his confession, so Bruton's problem is avoided.

But wait, the confession is against the son. So if it's being used against the father, is it hearsay? Because it's an out-of-court statement by the son to prove the father committed the crime. So yes, it's hearsay as to the father unless an exception applies.

I'm a bit confused here. On one hand, the confession is admissible against the son because it's his statement. But against the father, it's hearsay unless it falls under a co-conspirator exception or some other rule.

But since the question doesn't mention a conspiracy, I'm leaning towards the confession being inadmissible against the father. So the options are looking for which one applies.

Looking at the options:

A: Admitted against father only because son recanted. No, because the confession is the son's, so it's more about the son.

B: Not admitted against son, but admitted against father as it implicates him. Wait, the confession is the son's, so it's not hearsay against the son. But against the father, it is hearsay. So unless an exception applies, it's not admissible against the father.

C: Admitted against both because son implicated father. But unless it's a co-conspirator statement, which isn't established here, this might not be correct.

D: Not admitted against either because duress. The question doesn't mention duress, so probably not.

E: Admitted against both because it implicates the father. But again, hearsay issue for the father.

F: Admitted against both because jointly charged. Not necessarily, unless there's a rule about that.

G: Not admitted against either because hearsay. Well, against the son, it's not hearsay because it's his own statement. Against the father, it's hearsay unless an exception applies.

H: Not admitted against either because son recanted. But the admissibility of the confession against the son isn't affected by his recantation; he can testify differently, but the confession is still admissible against him.

I: Admitted against both because conspiracy. But no mention of conspiracy, so probably not applicable.

J: Admitted against son only.

So, the correct options would be that the confession is admissible against the son (E, J, or others) but not against the father unless an exception applies.

Wait, but the question is whether the confession should be admitted against both. Option E says admitted against both because the son implicated the father. But without a co-conspirator exception, that's hearsay against the father.

So the correct answer is that the confession is admissible against the son only (option E or J), but against the father, it's hearsay unless an exception applies. Since the options don't include that, I have to look again.

Wait, option E says admitted against both because the son implicated the father. But that's only possible if the statement is admissible against the father, which it isn't unless an exception applies. So the correct answer is that it's admissible against the son only, which is option J.

Wait, but option E says "admitted against both the son and the father, because the son implicated the father in the crime." But that's incorrect because it's hearsay against the father. So the correct answer would be that it's admissible against the son only, which is option E if it's allowed against the father, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is B: not admitted against the son, but admitted against the father as it implicates him.

Wait, no. The son's own confession is admissible against him regardless of his later testimony. So the prosecution can introduce the confession against the son. But against the father, it's hearsay unless an exception applies. So the confession is admissible against the son only.

Looking at the options, E says admitted against both because the son implicated the father. But that's hearsay against the father. So that's incorrect. Option J says admitted against the son only, which is correct.

So the correct answer is E if the father can be implicated via the confession, but I think without a co-conspirator exception, it's hearsay against the father. Therefore, the confession is only admissible against the son, making option J correct.

Wait, but I'm getting conflicting thoughts. Let me think again. The son's confession is his own statement, so it's admissible against him. As for the father, the confession is hearsay, unless it's a statement against penal interest. But the son's statement implicating his father would be a statement against his own interest, so maybe it's admissible under the exception for statements against penal interest. But wait, that exception applies when the declarant is unavailable as a witness, but here the son is testifying, so he's available. Therefore, the exception doesn't apply. So the confession is inadmissible against the father.

So the confession can be used against the son only, making option E incorrect and option J correct.

Wait, but option E says it's admitted against both because the son implicated the father. But without an exception, that's not the case. So the correct answer is that it's admitted against the son only, which is option E if that's the case, but I think option E is wrong because it's hearsay against the father.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The key is that the son's confession is admissible against him, but not against the father unless it's a co-conspirator statement. Since the question doesn't establish a conspiracy, the confession can't be used against the father. So the answer is that it's admitted against the son only, which is option E or J.

Wait, option E is admitted against both because the son implicated the father. No, that's not correct. Option J is admitted against the son only, which is correct.

So the correct answer is E if the statement can be used against both, but that's incorrect. Therefore, the correct answer is J: admitted against the son only.

The son's confession is admissible against him because it is his own statement made after Miranda warnings, even though he later recanted. However, against the father, the confession is hearsay unless a recognized exception applies. Since the question does not establish a conspiracy or any other exception, the confession cannot be used against the father. Therefore, the confession is only admissible against the son.
