The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

Assume all gases are perfect unless stated otherwise. Note that 1 atm = 1.013 25 bar. Unless otherwise stated, thermochemical data are for 298.15 K. The constant-volume heat capacity of a gas can be measured by observing the decrease in temperature when it expands adiabatically and reversibly. If the decrease in pressure is also measured, we can use it to infer the value of $\gamma=C_p / C_V$ and hence, by combining the two values, deduce the constant-pressure heat capacity. A fluorocarbon gas was allowed to expand reversibly and adiabatically to twice its volume; as a result, the temperature fell from $298.15 \mathrm{~K}$ to $248.44 \mathrm{~K}$ and its pressure fell from $202.94 \mathrm{kPa}$ to $81.840 \mathrm{kPa}$. Evaluate $C_p$.

<think>
Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let me read the question again carefully.

The problem states that a fluorocarbon gas undergoes a reversible adiabatic expansion, doubling its volume. As a result, the temperature drops from 298.15 K to 248.44 K, and the pressure decreases from 202.94 kPa to 81.840 kPa. I need to find the constant-pressure heat capacity, Cp, of the gas.

Hmm, I remember that for an adiabatic process, especially a reversible one, certain equations apply. The key equations for adiabatic processes involve the relation between temperature and volume, and temperature and pressure.

First, I think the formula for the temperature change during an adiabatic expansion is (T2 / T1) = (V1 / V2)^(γ-1), where γ is the heat capacity ratio, Cp/Cv. Since the volume doubles, V2 is 2V1, so V1/V2 is 1/2.

Let me write that down:

T2 = T1 * (V1/V2)^(γ-1)
So, T2/T1 = (1/2)^(γ-1)

Given T1 is 298.15 K and T2 is 248.44 K. Plugging in the numbers:

248.44 / 298.15 = (1/2)^(γ-1)

I can take the natural logarithm of both sides to solve for γ. Let me calculate the left side first. 248.44 divided by 298.15 is approximately 0.832. So ln(0.832) ≈ -0.184.

On the right side, ln[(1/2)^(γ-1)] = (γ-1) * ln(1/2). Since ln(1/2) is -0.693, so:

-0.184 ≈ (γ-1)*(-0.693)

Dividing both sides by -0.693 gives (γ-1) ≈ 0.184 / 0.693 ≈ 0.265.

So γ ≈ 1 + 0.265 = 1.265.

Wait, that seems a bit too straightforward. Let me double-check the calculation. 248.44 / 298.15 is indeed roughly 0.832. Let me compute it more accurately: 248.44 ÷ 298.15 ≈ 0.8322.

So ln(0.8322) is approximately ln(0.83) which is about -0.1863. So that part is correct. And since ln(1/2) is -0.6931, then (γ-1) = (-0.1863)/(-0.6931) ≈ 0.2687. So γ is about 1.2687. Let's round that to 1.269.

Alternatively, another approach is to use the pressure ratio. Because in an adiabatic process, the relation between pressure and volume is P2 = P1 * (V1/V2)^γ.

So the pressure drops from 202.94 kPa to 81.840 kPa. So P2/P1 = 81.840 / 202.94 ≈ 0.403.

Using the same formula: P2/P1 = (V1/V2)^γ → (1/2)^γ = 0.403.

Taking natural logs: ln(0.403) = γ * ln(1/2).

Compute ln(0.403) ≈ -0.908 and ln(1/2) ≈ -0.6931.

So -0.908 ≈ γ * (-0.6931). Therefore, γ ≈ 0.908 / 0.6931 ≈ 1.31.

Wait, that's a different value of γ than before. Hmm, so I get two different values for γ using temperature and pressure ratios. That can't be right, so I must have made a mistake.

Wait, maybe I mixed up the exponents. Let me think again. The correct relations for adiabatic processes are:

For temperature and volume: T2/T1 = (V1/V2)^(γ-1).

For pressure and volume: P2/P1 = (V1/V2)^γ.

Alternatively, another relation is T2/T1 = (P2/P1)^((γ-1)/γ).

Wait, maybe I should use one of the other adiabatic relations that involve both pressure and temperature.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use both the temperature and pressure data to find γ. Let me try that.

From the temperature change:

(T2 / T1) = (V1/V2)^(γ-1) → (248.44/298.15) = (1/2)^(γ-1).

From the pressure change:

P2/P1 = (V1/V2)^γ → (81.840/202.94) = (1/2)^γ.

So let me compute both.

Compute (T2/T1) = 248.44 / 298.15 ≈ 0.8322.

So 0.8322 = (1/2)^(γ -1).

Taking natural logs: ln(0.8322) = (γ -1) * ln(1/2).

As before, ln(0.8322) ≈ -0.1863, ln(1/2) ≈ -0.6931.

So (γ -1) = (-0.1863)/(-0.6931) ≈ 0.2687 → γ ≈ 1.2687.

From the pressure ratio: P2/P1 = 81.84 / 202.94 ≈ 0.403.

So 0.403 = (1/2)^γ → take ln: ln(0.403) = γ * ln(1/2).

ln(0.403) ≈ -0.908, so γ = (-0.908)/(-0.6931) ≈ 1.31.

Hmm, so from the temperature ratio, γ is about 1.269, and from the pressure ratio, it's about 1.31. These are close but not the same. I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should use a different approach. Let me consider the relation that connects T and P in an adiabatic process. The formula is T2/T1 = (P2/P1)^((γ-1)/γ).

Let me compute (T2/T1) and (P2/P1) and see if they are consistent.

Given: T2/T1 = 248.44 / 298.15 ≈ 0.8322.

P2/P1 = 81.84 / 202.94 ≈ 0.403.

So let's compute (P2/P1)^((γ-1)/γ) and see if it equals T2/T1.

Alternatively, I can set up the equation using both.

(T2/T1) = (P2/P1)^((γ-1)/γ)

So substituting the numbers:

0.8322 = (0.403)^((γ-1)/γ)

Taking natural logs: ln(0.8322) = (γ-1)/γ * ln(0.403).

We already have ln(0.8322) ≈ -0.1863 and ln(0.403) ≈ -0.908.

So:

-0.1863 = (γ-1)/γ * (-0.908)

Multiply both sides by -1:

0.1863 = (γ-1)/γ * 0.908

Divide both sides by 0.908:

(γ-1)/γ ≈ 0.1863 / 0.908 ≈ 0.205.

So (γ-1)/γ = 0.205 → let me write this as:

γ - 1 = 0.205 γ → γ - 0.205 γ = 1 → 0.795 γ =1 → γ ≈ 1 / 0.795 ≈ 1.257.

Hmm, that's another value, around 1.257. This is different from the previous two estimates. So now I'm getting γ ≈1.257 from this method.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately. Let me compute 0.1863 / 0.908:

0.1863 ÷ 0.908 ≈ 0.2051.

So (γ-1)/γ = 0.2051.

Rearranging:

γ - 1 = 0.2051 γ → γ - 0.2051 γ = 1 → 0.7949 γ =1 → γ ≈ 1 / 0.7949 ≈ 1.257.

So γ is approximately 1.257.

Wait, but earlier from the temperature ratio, I had γ ≈1.269, and from the pressure ratio, 1.31. These are close but not the same, which suggests maybe I should average them or find a more accurate method.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use both equations together to solve for γ accurately.

Let me denote γ as the ratio Cp/Cv.

We have two equations:

1) (T2 / T1) = (V1/V2)^(γ-1) → equation (1).

2) (P2 / P1) = (V1/V2)^γ → equation (2).

We can divide equation (1) by equation (2):

(T2/T1) / (P2/P1) = (V1/V2)^(γ-1) / (V1/V2)^γ = (V1/V2)^(-1) = (V2/V1).

So (T2/T1) / (P2/P1) = V2/V1.

Given that V2 = 2 V1, so V2/V1 =2.

Compute (T2/T1)/(P2/P1) = (0.8322)/(0.403) ≈ 2.065.

Which is approximately 2, which matches V2/V1=2, so this checks out. So perhaps the slight discrepancy is due to rounding.

Now, to find γ accurately, perhaps I can use both equations.

From equation (2):

P2/P1 = (V1/V2)^γ → 0.403 = (1/2)^γ → ln(0.403) = γ * ln(0.5).

So γ = ln(0.403)/ln(0.5) → ln(0.403)≈-0.908, ln(0.5)=−0.6931.

So γ ≈ (-0.908)/(-0.6931) ≈ 1.31.

But from equation (1), (T2/T1) = (V1/V2)^(γ-1) → 0.8322 = (1/2)^(γ-1).

Taking ln: ln(0.8322) = (γ-1) ln(0.5).

So γ-1 = ln(0.8322)/ln(0.5) ≈ (-0.1863)/(-0.6931) ≈ 0.2687 → γ ≈1.2687.

Hmm, so two different γs from the two equations. That can't be right, so perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, another thought: Since the process is adiabatic and reversible, we can also use the relation involving both temperature and pressure, such as T^γ P^{1-γ} = constant.

So, (T2/T1)^γ * (P2/P1)^{1-γ} = 1.

Wait, let me check that. The general adiabatic relation is T^γ = P^{γ*(1-γ)/(1-γ)} but maybe I should look it up.

Alternatively, the relation can be written as T^γ * P^{1-γ} = constant.

So let me compute (T2/T1)^γ * (P2/P1)^{1-γ} and see if it equals 1.

Given that, let's compute it with the values we have.

But wait, perhaps it's better to write it as:

(T2 / T1) = (P2 / P1)^{(γ-1)/γ}.

Which is the same as T2/T1 = (P2/P1)^{1 - 1/γ}.

So substituting the known values:

0.8322 = (0.403)^{(γ-1)/γ}.

Taking natural logs:

ln(0.8322) = [(γ-1)/γ] * ln(0.403).

As before, ln(0.8322) ≈ -0.1863 and ln(0.403)≈-0.908.

So:

-0.1863 = [(γ-1)/γ] * (-0.908)

Multiply both sides by -1:

0.1863 = [(γ-1)/γ] * 0.908.

Divide both sides by 0.908:

(γ-1)/γ ≈ 0.1863 / 0.908 ≈ 0.205.

So (γ-1)/γ = 0.205 → γ-1 = 0.205 γ → γ -0.205 γ =1 → 0.795 γ=1 → γ≈1.257.

Hmm, so γ is approximately 1.257.

Wait, but earlier I had γ from the pressure ratio as 1.31 and from the temperature ratio as 1.2687. So perhaps the more accurate value is around 1.257.

But wait, let me compute this more accurately.

Let me compute the left-hand side of the equation (T2/T1) = (P2/P1)^{(γ-1)/γ}.

So 0.8322 = (0.403)^{(γ-1)/γ}.

Taking natural logs:

ln(0.8322) = (γ-1)/γ * ln(0.403).

So:

(γ-1)/γ = ln(0.8322)/ln(0.403) = (-0.1863)/(-0.908) ≈ 0.2051.

So:

(γ-1)/γ = 0.2051 → γ-1 = 0.2051 γ → γ -0.2051 γ =1 → 0.7949 γ =1 → γ=1/0.7949≈1.257.

So γ≈1.257.

Wait, perhaps I should use more precise values for the logarithms to get a more accurate γ.

Let me compute ln(0.8322) more accurately.

Using a calculator: ln(0.8322) ≈-0.1863.

And ln(0.403) ≈-0.908.

So (γ-1)/γ = (-0.1863)/(-0.908) = 0.2051.

So γ ≈1.257.

Now, I have γ≈1.257.

The problem is to find Cp, the constant-pressure heat capacity.

We know that γ = Cp/Cv → Cp = γ * Cv.

But how do I find Cv?

Wait, the problem says that the constant-volume heat capacity can be measured by observing the decrease in temperature when the gas expands adiabatically and reversibly. So perhaps we can find Cv from the temperature change.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use the relation involving the work done in the expansion, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: The change in internal energy (ΔU) during an adiabatic process is zero because Q=0. So ΔU = n Cv ΔT.

But wait, the process is adiabatic, so Q=0, and ΔU = W, the work done on the system. But since the gas is expanding, it's doing work, so ΔU is negative.

But perhaps I can find the number of moles, n, using the ideal gas law, since we have the initial and final states.

Wait, but without knowing n, perhaps I can find it in terms of R.

Wait, but maybe I can use the relation between the temperatures and volumes to find the ratio.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find Cv using the relation γ = Cp/Cv → Cp = γ Cv → and knowing that Cp - Cv = nR → but without n, perhaps I can express Cv in terms of R.

But wait, for an ideal gas, Cp - Cv = nR. But since we're dealing with molar heat capacities, Cp and Cv are per mole. So Cp - Cv = R.

Wait, wait, no. Cp and Cv are molar heat capacities. So for one mole, Cp - Cv = R.

Yes, because for an ideal gas, Cp - Cv = R.

So, from γ = Cp/Cv → Cp = γ Cv.

And Cp - Cv = R → γ Cv - Cv = R → Cv (γ -1) = R → Cv = R/(γ-1).

But R is the gas constant, which is 8.314 J/mol·K.

So, with γ≈1.257, γ-1=0.257.

Thus, Cv = 8.314 / 0.257 ≈ 32.35 J/mol·K.

Then, Cp = γ * Cv ≈1.257 * 32.35 ≈40.65 J/mol·K.

Wait, but looking at the options, the closest one is option C:38.70 J/K/mol, option G:41.40, etc.

Hmm, but perhaps my value of γ is a bit off. Let me check the calculations again.

Wait, perhaps I should compute γ more accurately. Let me recompute using more precise values.

Let me compute the temperature ratio and pressure ratio more accurately.

Given:

T1 = 298.15 K, T2 =248.44 K.

P1=202.94 kPa, P2=81.840 kPa.

Compute T2/T1: 248.44 / 298.15 = ?

Let me calculate this: 248.44 ÷ 298.15.

298.15 is approximately 298.15.

248.44 ÷ 298.15 ≈ 0.8322.

Similarly, P2/P1=81.840 / 202.94 ≈ 0.403.

Now, using the relation (T2/T1) = (P2/P1)^{(γ-1)/γ}.

So:

0.8322 = (0.403)^{(γ-1)/γ}.

Taking natural logs:

ln(0.8322) = [(γ-1)/γ] * ln(0.403).

Let me compute ln(0.8322) and ln(0.403) precisely.

Using a calculator:

ln(0.8322)= approximately -0.1863.

ln(0.403)= approximately -0.908.

So:

-0.1863 = [(γ-1)/γ] * (-0.908).

Dividing both sides by -0.908:

(γ-1)/γ = 0.1863 / 0.908 ≈ 0.2051.

So (γ-1)/γ = 0.2051 → γ-1 = 0.2051 γ → γ (1 - 0.2051) =1 → γ=1/0.7949≈1.257.

So γ≈1.257.

Now, using Cp = γ Cv and Cp - Cv = R.

So, Cp = γ Cv → Cv = Cp / γ.

And Cp - (Cp/γ) = R → Cp (1 - 1/γ) = R → Cp = R / (1 - 1/γ).

But 1 - 1/γ = (γ -1)/γ.

So Cp = R * γ/(γ -1).

So with R=8.314 J/mol·K, γ=1.257, γ-1=0.257.

Cp = 8.314 *1.257 /0.257 ≈ ?

Compute denominator: 0.257.

So 1.257 / 0.257 ≈ 4.895.

Then, 8.314 *4.895 ≈ ?

Let me compute 8 *4.895 =39.16, 0.314 *4.895≈1.537 → total≈39.16+1.537=40.697 J/mol·K.

So approximately 40.7 J/mol·K.

Looking at the options, option G is 41.40, which is close but not exact. Option C is 38.70, which is a bit lower.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the γ value. Let me try using more precise values for the temperature and pressure ratios.

Compute T2/T1 more accurately:

248.44 / 298.15 = ?

Let me compute this division precisely.

298.15 × 0.832 = ?

0.8 ×298.15 =238.52

0.03 ×298.15=8.9445 → 0.83 ×298.15=247.4645.

0.002 ×298.15=0.5963 → 0.832 ×298.15=247.4645 +0.5963=248.0608.

But T2 is 248.44, so 0.832 ×298.15=248.0608, which is less than 248.44. So let's compute 248.44 ÷298.15.

Let me compute it as:

248.44 ÷298.15 = (248.44 ×10000) ÷ (298.15 ×10000) = 2484400 ÷ 2981500 ≈0.8322.

Alternatively, using a calculator: 248.44 ÷298.15 ≈0.8322.

Similarly, P2/P1=81.840 ÷202.94≈0.403.

Now, more accurately, let's compute ln(0.8322) and ln(0.403).

Using a calculator:

ln(0.8322)= -0.18633.

ln(0.403)= -0.90829.

So:

(γ-1)/γ = (-0.18633)/(-0.90829) = 0.20515.

So γ=1/(1-0.20515) = 1/0.79485≈1.2575.

Now, compute Cp using Cp = R * γ/(γ-1).

So γ=1.2575, γ-1=0.2575.

So γ/(γ-1) =1.2575/0.2575≈4.891.

So Cp=8.314 *4.891≈?

8 *4.891=39.128.

0.314 *4.891≈1.536.

Total≈39.128 +1.536=40.664 J/mol·K.

So approximately 40.66 J/mol·K.

Looking at the options, option G is 41.40, which is a bit higher. Option C is 38.70, which is lower. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the relation between Cp and Cv without relying on γ.

Wait, another approach: Since we have the adiabatic process, and we can find γ from the data, then use Cp = γ Cv and Cp - Cv = R.

Wait, but maybe the data given allows us to find Cv directly.

The problem states that the constant-volume heat capacity can be measured by observing the decrease in temperature when the gas expands adiabatically. So perhaps we can find Cv using the temperature change.

In an adiabatic process, the change in internal energy is equal to the work done. But for a constant-volume process, no work is done, but here the process is adiabatic and expansion, so volume changes.

Wait, but perhaps using the formula for the temperature change in an adiabatic expansion:

ΔT = T2 - T1 = - (P2 - P1) * V / (Cv).

Wait, no, that's not the correct formula. Alternatively, for an adiabatic process, the relation between temperature and pressure is given by:

T^(γ) P^{1-γ} = constant.

But perhaps it's better to go back to the first law.

In an adiabatic process, Q=0, so ΔU = W, the work done by the system is negative, so ΔU = -W.

The work done by the gas during expansion is W = n R (T2 - T1)/(γ-1), but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps using the formula for the work done in an adiabatic process:

W = (P1 V1 - P2 V2)/(γ-1).

But without knowing the number of moles, n, perhaps I can find it using the ideal gas law.

At initial state: P1 V1 = n R T1.

At final state: P2 V2 = n R T2.

Since V2=2 V1, P2 V2 = P2 * 2 V1 = n R T2.

But P1 V1 =n R T1 → V1= (n R T1)/P1.

So P2 * 2 V1 =n R T2 → P2 *2*(n R T1)/P1 =n R T2.

Simplify:

2 P2 T1 / P1 = T2.

So 2*(81.840 kPa)*298.15 K / (202.94 kPa) = ?

Compute numerator: 2*81.840 *298.15 ≈ 2*81.840=163.68; 163.68 *298.15≈163.68*300=49,104 minus 163.68*1.85≈303. So approx 49,104 - 303≈48,801.

Denominator: 202.94 kPa.

So 48,801 /202.94 ≈ 240.6.

But T2 is 248.44 K, so this doesn't match. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, let's compute it accurately.

Compute 2 * P2 * T1 / P1:

2 *81.840 kPa *298.15 K /202.94 kPa.

The kPa units cancel out.

So compute 2*81.840*298.15 /202.94.

Calculate numerator: 2*81.840=163.68; 163.68 *298.15.

Let me compute 163.68 * 298 = ?

163.68 * 300 =49,104 → subtract 163.68 *2=327.36 → 49,104 - 327.36=48,776.64.

Then, 163.68 *0.15=24.552 → total numerator≈48,776.64 +24.552=48,801.192.

Now, divide by 202.94:

48,801.192 /202.94 ≈ let's compute 202.94 *240 =48,705.6.

Subtract from numerator: 48,801.192 -48,705.6=95.592.

Now, 95.592 /202.94 ≈0.4706.

So total is 240 +0.4706≈240.4706 K.

But T2 is 248.44 K, so this suggests that 2 P2 T1 /P1 ≈240.47 K, which is less than T2=248.44 K. That's a discrepancy, which suggests that perhaps the assumption that the process is adiabatic and the ideal gas law applies here. Alternatively, perhaps the gas isn't ideal, but the problem states that all gases are perfect unless stated otherwise, so ideal gas law should hold.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me check the formula again.

The relation I used is from the ideal gas law: P1 V1 =n R T1 and P2 V2=n R T2.

Since V2=2 V1, P2*2 V1 =n R T2.

But P1 V1 =n R T1 → V1 = (n R T1)/P1.

Substituting into P2*2 V1 =n R T2:

P2 *2*(n R T1)/P1 =n R T2 → 2 P2 T1 / P1 = T2.

So T2 should equal 2 P2 T1 / P1.

But when I compute it, I got 240.47 K, but the given T2 is 248.44 K.

This discrepancy suggests that perhaps the process isn't ideal, but the problem states to assume all gases are perfect, so I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated 2 P2 T1 / P1.

Let me compute it again accurately.

P2=81.840 kPa, T1=298.15 K, P1=202.94 kPa.

2 * P2 * T1 = 2 *81.840 *298.15.

Compute 81.840 *298.15:

First, 80 *298.15=23,852.

1.840 *298.15≈548.016.

So total ≈23,852 +548.016=24,400.016.

Multiply by 2: 48,800.032.

Now, divide by P1=202.94:

48,800.032 /202.94 ≈ let me compute 202.94 *240=48,705.6.

48,800.032 -48,705.6=94.432.

94.432 /202.94≈0.465.

So total T2=240 +0.465=240.465 K.

But the given T2 is 248.44 K, which is higher. So this suggests that the process isn't following the ideal gas law, which contradicts the problem statement. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps I should instead use the relation for an adiabatic process involving temperature and pressure.

The formula is T2/T1 = (P2/P1)^{(γ-1)/γ}.

We can use this to find γ.

So let me compute (T2/T1) and (P2/P1) and solve for γ.

Compute (T2/T1) =248.44/298.15 ≈0.8322.

Compute (P2/P1)=81.840/202.94≈0.403.

Now, let me take the ratio:

(T2/T1)/(P2/P1) = (0.8322)/(0.403) ≈2.065.

But from the adiabatic relations, we have:

(T2/T1) = (P2/P1)^{(γ-1)/γ}.

Taking both sides to the power of γ/(γ-1):

(P2/P1) = (T2/T1)^{γ/(γ-1)}.

Wait, perhaps that's not helpful. Alternatively, let me take the natural logs again.

ln(T2/T1) = (γ-1)/γ * ln(P2/P1).

So, ln(0.8322)= (γ-1)/γ * ln(0.403).

We have:

ln(0.8322)= -0.1863.

ln(0.403)= -0.908.

So:

-0.1863 = (γ-1)/γ * (-0.908).

Divide both sides by -0.908:

(γ-1)/γ ≈0.2051.

So γ=1/(1-0.2051)=1/0.7949≈1.257.

So γ≈1.257.

Now, using Cp = γ Cv and Cp - Cv = R → Cp= γ/(γ-1) R.

So Cp= (1.257)/(0.257) *8.314 ≈4.895 *8.314≈40.69 J/mol·K.

Which is approximately 40.7 J/mol·K.

Looking back at the options, the closest is option G:41.40 J/K/mol.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of γ. Let me try a more precise calculation.

Let me compute (T2/T1)/(P2/P1) = (0.8322)/(0.403)≈2.065.

But from the adiabatic relation, (T2/T1)/(P2/P1) should equal (V2/V1)=2.

So 2.065 ≈2, which is close, suggesting that the approximation is acceptable.

Now, perhaps the slight discrepancy is due to the precision of the logarithms. Let me compute (γ-1)/γ more accurately.

From:

(γ-1)/γ=0.20515.

So γ=1/(1-0.20515)=1/0.79485≈1.2575.

Now, Cp= γ/(γ-1) * R = (1.2575/0.2575)*8.314.

Compute 1.2575/0.2575:

0.2575 ×4.89=1.2575.

So it's exactly 4.89.

Thus, Cp=4.89 *8.314≈4.89*8=39.12, 4.89*0.314≈1.537 → total≈40.657 J/mol·K.

So approximately 40.66 J/mol·K.

Looking at the options, the closest is option G:41.40 J/K/mol. But that's a bit higher. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in using the formula.

Wait, another approach: Using the relation for an adiabatic process, the work done is W = (P1 V1 - P2 V2)/(γ-1).

But without knowing V1 or n, perhaps I can find it using the ideal gas law.

From the initial state: P1 V1 =n R T1.

Similarly, V2=2 V1.

So, the work done is:

W = (P1 V1 - P2 *2 V1)/(γ-1) = V1 (P1 -2 P2)/(γ-1).

But ΔU = -W = -V1 (P1 -2 P2)/(γ-1).

But ΔU is also n Cv (T2 - T1).

So,

n Cv (T2 - T1) = - [V1 (P1 -2 P2)/(γ-1)].

But from the ideal gas law, V1 =n R T1 / P1.

Substituting:

n Cv (T2 - T1) = - [ (n R T1 / P1) * (P1 -2 P2) ) / (γ-1) ].

Simplify:

n Cv (T2 - T1) = - [ n R T1 (P1 -2 P2) ) / (P1 (γ-1)) ) ].

Cancel n from both sides:

Cv (T2 - T1) = - [ R T1 (P1 -2 P2) ) / (P1 (γ-1)) ) ].

Rearranging:

Cv = [ R T1 (2 P2 - P1) ) ] / [ P1 (γ-1) (T2 - T1) ) ].

But wait, T2 < T1, so T2 - T1 is negative, and 2 P2 = 163.68 kPa, which is less than P1=202.94 kPa, so 2 P2 - P1 is negative. So numerator and denominator would both be positive, as Cv is positive.

Let me plug in the numbers.

R=8.314 J/mol·K.

T1=298.15 K.

P1=202.94 kPa.

P2=81.840 kPa.

T2=248.44 K.

γ=1.257.

Compute 2 P2 - P1 = 2*81.840 -202.94 =163.68 -202.94= -39.26 kPa.

So numerator: R T1 (2 P2 - P1) =8.314 *298.15*(-39.26).

Denominator: P1 (γ-1) (T2 - T1) =202.94*(0.257)*(248.44-298.15).

Compute denominator:

T2 - T1 =248.44-298.15= -49.71 K.

So denominator=202.94 *0.257*(-49.71).

Compute denominator:

202.94 *0.257 ≈52.19.

52.19*(-49.71)≈-2590.0.

Numerator:

8.314 *298.15=2477.5.

2477.5*(-39.26)≈-97,  2477.5 *39.26≈ let me compute 2477.5 *40=99,100 → minus 2477.5*0.74≈1833 → 99,100 -1,833≈97,267.

So numerator≈-97,267 J·kPa/mol·K.

Wait, but units might be getting a bit messy here.

But let's compute the value:

Cv = [8.314 *298.15*(-39.26)] / [202.94 *0.257*(-49.71)].

The negatives cancel, so:

Cv = (8.314 *298.15 *39.26) / (202.94 *0.257 *49.71).

Compute numerator:8.314 *298.15 ≈2477.5; 2477.5 *39.26≈97,267.

Denominator:202.94 *0.257≈52.19; 52.19 *49.71≈2590.0.

So Cv≈97,267 /2590 ≈37.5 J/mol·K.

Hmm, that's around 37.5 J/mol·K.

Then, Cp= γ Cv ≈1.257 *37.5 ≈47.1 J/mol·K.

Wait, that's significantly higher than the previous estimate. But this approach seems more direct.

Wait, but this result contradicts the earlier calculation where Cp was around 40.7 J/mol·K.

I must have made a mistake somewhere. Let me check the formula again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sign. Since the gas is expanding, work is done by the system, so ΔU is negative, and the formula should account for that.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have taken absolute values since we're dealing with magnitudes.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Compute numerator: 8.314 *298.15 *39.26.

Let me compute step by step.

8.314 *298.15 ≈8 *298.15=2385.2; 0.314 *298.15≈93.7 → total≈2385.2 +93.7=2478.9.

2478.9 *39.26 → let's compute 2478.9 *40 =99,156 → subtract 2478.9 *0.74≈1832 → 99,156 -1,832=97,324.

Denominator:202.94 *0.257 *49.71.

202.94 *0.257 ≈202.94 *0.25=50.735; 202.94 *0.007≈1.42058 → total≈50.735+1.42058≈52.156.

52.156 *49.71 ≈52 *50=2600; 52 * (-0.29)= -15.08 → 52 *49.71≈52*(50-0.29)=2600 -15.08=2584.92.

Plus 0.156 *49.71≈7.75 → total≈2584.92 +7.75≈2592.67.

So Cv=97,324 /2592.67≈37.51 J/mol·K.

Then, Cp=γ * Cv=1.257 *37.51≈47.13 J/mol·K.

Wait, that's around 47.1 J/mol·K.

Looking at the options, option B is 47.80, which is close. Alternatively, perhaps my calculation of γ was slightly off, leading to a higher Cp.

Wait, but earlier using Cp=γ/(γ-1)*R gave me about 40.7 J/mol·K, but using this method, I get around 47.1 J/mol·K.

Hmm, this suggests I made a mistake in one of the approaches. Let me check where I might have gone wrong.

Wait, perhaps in the first approach, I used Cp=γ/(γ-1)*R, which assumes that Cp and Cv are molar heat capacities, but perhaps I should have used the relation Cp = Cv + R, which is correct for ideal gases.

Given that, with Cp = γ Cv and Cp = Cv + R, substituting gives γ Cv = Cv + R → Cv (γ -1) = R → Cv=R/(γ-1).

So with γ=1.257, Cv=8.314/(0.257)≈32.35 J/mol·K.

Then, Cp=γ * Cv=1.257 *32.35≈40.66 J/mol·K.

But in the second approach, using the work done, I got Cp≈47.1 J/mol·K, which is significantly higher.

This discrepancy suggests I made a mistake in one of the methods. Let me re-examine the second approach.

In the second approach, I used the formula for work done in an adiabatic process:

W = (P1 V1 - P2 V2)/(γ-1).

But in an adiabatic expansion, the work done by the gas is positive, so W>0.

The change in internal energy is ΔU = -W.

ΔU is also equal to n Cv (T2 - T1).

So,

n Cv (T2 - T1) = -W = - (P1 V1 - P2 V2)/(γ-1).

But V2=2 V1, so:

n Cv (T2 - T1) = - (P1 V1 -2 P2 V1)/(γ-1) = -V1 (P1 -2 P2)/(γ-1).

But V1 =n R T1 / P1.

Substituting:

n Cv (T2 - T1) = - (n R T1 / P1) (P1 -2 P2)/(γ-1).

Cancel n:

Cv (T2 - T1) = - [ R T1 (P1 -2 P2) ) / ( P1 (γ-1) ) ].

Rearranged:

Cv = [ R T1 (2 P2 - P1) ) ] / [ P1 (γ-1) (T1 - T2) ) ].

Wait, I think I made a mistake in the sign here. Since T2 < T1, T1 - T2 is positive, and 2 P2 - P1 is negative (as 2*81.840=163.68 <202.94).

So the numerator becomes negative, denominator positive, so Cv would be negative, which is impossible. So perhaps I should take absolute values.

Alternatively, perhaps I should write it as:

Cv = [ R T1 (P1 -2 P2) ) ] / [ P1 (γ-1) (T1 - T2) ) ].

So let's compute that.

Compute numerator: R T1 (P1 -2 P2) =8.314 *298.15*(202.94 -2*81.840).

2*81.840=163.68 → 202.94-163.68=39.26 kPa.

So numerator=8.314 *298.15 *39.26.

Denominator= P1 (γ-1) (T1 - T2) =202.94 *0.257*(298.15-248.44)=202.94 *0.257*49.71.

Compute numerator:

8.314 *298.15≈2477.5.

2477.5 *39.26≈2477.5*40=99,100 → minus 2477.5*0.74≈1,833 → 99,100 -1,833≈97,267.

Denominator:

202.94 *0.257≈52.156.

52.156 *49.71≈52.156*50=2607.8 → minus 52.156*0.29≈15.125 → 2607.8 -15.125≈2592.675.

So Cv=97,267 /2592.675≈37.51 J/mol·K.

Then, Cp=γ * Cv=1.257 *37.51≈47.13 J/mol·K.

But this contradicts the earlier approach. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in one of the methods.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to use the relation Cp = γ/(γ-1) R, which gave Cp≈40.7 J/mol·K.

But given the options, option G is 41.40 J/K/mol, which is close to 40.7.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the more accurate value of γ.

Earlier, using the pressure and temperature ratios, I found γ≈1.257.

Using Cp=γ/(γ-1) R → 1.257/(0.257) *8.314≈4.895 *8.314≈40.69 J/mol·K.

So approximately 40.7 J/mol·K.

Looking at the options, option G is 41.40, which is close. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C:38.70, but that's lower.

Wait, perhaps I should check the calculation using the work done approach again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. The correct formula for the work done in an adiabatic process is W = (P1 V1 - P2 V2)/(γ-1).

But since V2=2 V1, W = (P1 V1 -2 P2 V1)/(γ-1) = V1 (P1 -2 P2)/(γ-1).

But from the ideal gas law, V1 =n R T1 / P1.

So W = (n R T1 / P1) * (P1 -2 P2) / (γ-1).

The change in internal energy ΔU = -W = -n Cv (T2 - T1).

So,

-n Cv (T2 - T1) = - (n R T1 (P1 -2 P2))/(P1 (γ-1)).

Cancel n and multiply both sides by -1:

Cv (T2 - T1) = [ R T1 (P1 -2 P2) ] / [ P1 (γ-1) ].

Since T2 < T1, T2 - T1 is negative, and P1 -2 P2 is positive (as P1=202.94 kPa, 2 P2=163.68 kPa).

So,

Cv = [ R T1 (P1 -2 P2) ] / [ P1 (γ-1) (T1 - T2) ].

Plugging in the numbers:

R=8.314 J/mol·K.

T1=298.15 K.

P1=202.94 kPa.

P2=81.840 kPa.

T2=248.44 K.

γ=1.257.

Compute numerator: R T1 (P1 -2 P2) =8.314 *298.15*(202.94 -163.68)=8.314 *298.15 *39.26.

Denominator: P1 (γ-1) (T1 - T2)=202.94 *0.257*(298.15 -248.44)=202.94 *0.257 *49.71.

Compute numerator:8.314 *298.15=2477.5 → 2477.5 *39.26≈97,267 J·kPa/mol·K.

Denominator:202.94 *0.257=52.156 →52.156 *49.71≈2592.675 J·kPa/mol·K.

So Cv=97,267 /2592.675≈37.51 J/mol·K.

Then, Cp=γ * Cv=1.257 *37.51≈47.13 J/mol·K.

This suggests that Cp≈47.1 J/mol·K, which is close to option B:47.80.

But earlier, using Cp=γ/(γ-1)*R gave me around 40.7 J/mol·K.

This discrepancy is confusing. I must have made a mistake in one of the approaches.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in assuming that the process is adiabatic and the work done is calculated correctly. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to use the relation Cp = γ/(γ-1) R, which gives Cp≈40.7 J/mol·K, which is close to option G:41.40.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C:38.70 J/K/mol, but that's lower than both estimates.

Wait, perhaps I should cross-check with the given data.

Let me try to compute γ using the pressure ratio and volume ratio.

From the pressure ratio: P2/P1 = (V1/V2)^γ → 0.403 = (1/2)^γ.

Taking ln: ln(0.403) = γ * ln(0.5).

So γ= ln(0.403)/ln(0.5)= (-0.908)/(-0.693)=≈1.31.

Using this γ, compute Cp=γ/(γ-1) R=1.31/(0.31)*8.314≈4.2258 *8.314≈35.14 J/mol·K.

Wait, that's around 35 J/mol·K, which is close to option I:35.20.

But earlier, using the temperature ratio, I got γ≈1.257, leading to Cp≈40.7 J/mol·K.

This suggests that perhaps the correct approach is to use the temperature ratio to find γ, as it gives a more accurate result for the process.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C:38.70, which is between 35 and 40.

But I'm getting conflicting results from different methods, which suggests I made a mistake somewhere.

After much consideration, I think the correct approach is to use the relation Cp = γ/(γ-1) R, where γ is determined from the temperature ratio, leading to Cp≈40.7 J/mol·K, which is closest to option G:41.40.
</think>

To determine the constant-pressure heat capacity \( C_p \) of the fluorocarbon gas, we analyze the given adiabatic expansion data. The gas expands reversibly and adiabatically, doubling its volume, with the temperature dropping from \( T_1 = 298.15 \, \mathrm{K} \) to \( T_2 = 248.44 \, \mathrm{K} \), and the pressure dropping from \( P_1 = 202.94 \, \mathrm{kPa} \) to \( P_2 = 81.840 \, \mathrm{kPa} \).

### Step 1: Determine the heat capacity ratio \( \gamma = \frac{C_p}{C_v} \)
For an adiabatic process, the temperature-pressure relation is:
\[
\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \left( \frac{P_2}{P_1} \right)^{\frac{\gamma - 1}{\gamma}}
\]
Substituting the given values:
\[
\frac{248.44}{298.15} = \left( \frac{81.840}{202.94} \right)^{\frac{\gamma - 1}{\gamma}}
\]
\[
0.8322 = (0.403)^{\frac{\gamma - 1}{\gamma}}
\]
Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:
\[
\ln(0.8322) = \frac{\gamma - 1}{\gamma} \ln(0.403)
\]
\[
-0.1863 = \frac{\gamma - 1}{\gamma} (-0.908)
\]
\[
\frac{\gamma - 1}{\gamma} = \frac{0.1863}{0.908} \approx 0.2051
\]
Solving for \( \gamma \):
\[
\gamma - 1 = 0.2051 \gamma \quad \Rightarrow \quad \gamma (1 - 0.2051) = 1 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \gamma \approx 1.257
\]

### Step 2: Calculate \( C_p \) using \( \gamma \)
For an ideal gas, the relation between \( C_p \) and \( C_v \) is:
\[
C_p - C_v = R
\]
where \( R = 8.314 \, \mathrm{J \, K^{-1} \, mol^{-1}} \). Additionally, \( \gamma = \frac{C_p}{C_v} \), so:
\[
C_p = \gamma C_v
\]
Substituting \( C_v = \frac{R}{\gamma - 1} \):
\[
C_p = \gamma \frac{R}{\gamma - 1}
\]
\[
C_p = \frac{\gamma}{\gamma - 1} R
\]
Using \( \gamma \approx 1.257 \):
\[
C_p = \frac{1.257}{1.257 - 1} \cdot 8.314 \approx \frac{1.257}{0.257} \cdot 8.314 \approx 4.895 \cdot 8.314 \approx 40.7 \, \mathrm{J \, K^{-1} \, mol^{-1}}
\]

### Step 3: Compare with the options
The calculated \( C_p \approx 40.7 \, \mathrm{J \, K^{-1} \, mol^{-1}} \) is closest to option **G: 41.40 \, \mathrm{J \, K^{-1} \, mol^{-1}}**.

ANSWER: G
