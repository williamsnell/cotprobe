Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about relations in set theory. I need to figure out which statement is true. Let me go through each option one by one and think it through.

First, the options are labeled A to J. I'll start by recalling some basic concepts about relations.

A relation on a set A is a subset of the Cartesian product A × A. Relations can have properties like reflexive, symmetric, transitive, and antisymmetric. Also, the number of possible relations between two sets depends on their sizes.

Let's look at each option:

**Option A: Empty relation is not reflexive.**
- A relation R on set A is reflexive if every element of A is related to itself, i.e., (a,a) ∈ R for all a ∈ A.
- The empty relation has no elements. So, for any a in A, (a,a) is not in R. Therefore, the empty relation cannot be reflexive because it fails to include all diagonal elements. So A is true.

**Option B: Number of relations from A = {x, y, z} to B = {1, 2, 3} is 64.**
- The number of relations from A to B is 2^(|A| × |B|). Here, |A|=3 and |B|=3, so 2^(3×3)=2^9=512. 64 is 2^6, which is much less. So B is false.

**Option C: Properties of a relation being symmetric and being unsymmetric are positives of each other.**
- Wait, "unsymmetric" isn't a standard term. Maybe they mean asymmetric? Or perhaps it's a typo. Assuming they mean asymmetric, symmetric and asymmetric are opposites in the sense that a relation can't be both symmetric and asymmetric. But "properties being positive of each other" isn't the right terminology. Alternatively, if "un-symmetric" refers to asymmetric, then if a relation is symmetric, it can't be asymmetric, so they are opposites. But the wording is unclear. I'm not sure, so I'll hold off on this for now.

**Option D: Empty relation is reflexive.**
- As I thought before, the empty relation can't be reflexive because it doesn't contain any pairs, including the required (a,a) pairs. So D is false.

**Option E: Properties of a relation being symmetric and being un-symmetric are negative of each other.**
- Similar to option C. If "un-symmetric" is asymmetric, then symmetric and asymmetric are mutually exclusive, so they can't both hold. So perhaps this is trying to say that they are negatives. But the exact wording is a bit confusing. Not sure yet, but maybe E is correct if it's about being negatives.

Wait, but in logic, the terms "positive" and "negative" aren't standard. Maybe they mean that symmetric and asymmetric are opposites. So, if a relation is symmetric, it can't be asymmetric, and vice versa. So E might be correct if it's about being opposites, but the wording is a bit unclear. Alternatively, maybe E is trying to say that being symmetric and asymmetric are mutually exclusive, which is true. So maybe E is true.

But I'm not entirely certain because the wording isn't precise. Let me come back to this after checking other options.

**Option F: Number of relations from A = {x, y, z} to B = {1, 2} is 64.**
- |A|=3, |B|=2. So the number of relations is 2^(3×2)=2^6=64. So F is true.

Wait, earlier I thought B was false because it was 512, but F is 64, which is correct. So F is true.

But wait, the question is which statement is true. So both A and F could be true. But let me check the rest to see if there are more.

**Option G: Every equivalence relation is a partial-ordering relation.**
- An equivalence relation is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive. A partial order is reflexive, antisymmetric, and transitive.
- Equivalence relations are not necessarily partial orders because they require symmetry, whereas partial orders require antisymmetry. For example, equality is an equivalence relation but not a partial order. So G is false.

**Option H: Every partial-ordering relation is an equivalence relation.**
- Partial orders are not necessarily equivalence relations because they lack symmetry. For example, ≤ on integers is a partial order but not symmetric (since 2 ≤ 3 doesn't imply 3 ≤ 2). So H is false.

**Option I: Number of relations from A = {x, y, z} to B = {1, 2} is 32.**
- As calculated earlier, it's 64. So I is false.

**Option J: Properties of a relation being symmetric and being anti-symmetric are negatives of each other.**
- Symmetric means if (a,b) ∈ R, then (b,a) ∈ R. Antisymmetric means if (a,b) and (b,a) are both in R, then a = b.
- These are not direct opposites. A relation can be both symmetric and antisymmetric. For example, the equality relation is both symmetric and antisymmetric. So J is false.

Now, let's recap the options:

- A: True
- B: False
- C: Unclear, but possibly true if "un-symmetric" is asymmetric and they are opposites
- D: False
- E: Unclear, maybe true if being opposites
- F: True
- G: False
- H: False
- I: False
- J: False

Wait, so both A and F are true? But the question is asking which statement is true, implying only one correct answer. Hmm. Let me double-check.

Wait, I think I made a mistake. Option F says the number of relations from A to B is 64. A has 3 elements, B has 2. The number of possible relations is 2^(3×2)=64, so F is correct.

Option A says the empty relation is not reflexive. Yes, that's correct.

So both A and F are true. But looking back at the options, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check the options again.

Wait, the options are A to J, and the question is which statement is true. So it's possible that more than one is true, but in multiple-choice questions, usually only one is correct. But the way the question is phrased, it's "which of the following statements is true"—so possibly more than one could be correct. But perhaps I need to see which one is correct.

Wait, but let me check the options again.

Wait, looking back, the options are:

A: Empty relation is not reflexive. Correct.

F: Number of relations from A to B is 64. Correct.

So both A and F are correct. But the options are A to J, and the user is asking me to choose one. So perhaps I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I misread the options. Let me check again.

Option B: A to B where A has 3, B has 3: 2^9=512, so B says 64, which is wrong.

Option F: A has 3, B has 2: 2^(3×2)=64, correct.

So F is true.

Option A is also true. So the question is, which of the following is true. So both A and F could be correct. But the options are A-J, and the user is asking for the correct letter.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is both A and F, but the options don't allow for multiple choices. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering whether A is correct.

Wait, the empty relation: is it reflexive? Let me think again. A relation R on set A is reflexive if for every a ∈ A, (a,a) ∈ R. The empty relation has no elements, so all (a,a) are missing. Thus, it's not reflexive. So A is correct.

So both A and F are correct. But in the given options, perhaps only one is correct. Or maybe the question allows for multiple correct answers, but the way it's presented, the user is to select one. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the options.

Wait, looking back:

The user wrote:

Options:

A: Empty relation _ is not reflexive.

B: Number of relations from A = {x, y, z} to B= (1, 2, 3), is 64.

C: Properties of a relation being symmetric and being un-symmetric are positive of each other.

D: Empty relation _ is reflexive

E: Properties of a relation being symmetric and being un-symmetric are negative of each other.

F: Number of relations form A = {x, y, z} to B= (1, 2), is 64.

G: Every equivalence relation is a partial-ordering relation.

H: Every partial-ordering relation is an equivalence relation.

I: Number of relations from A = {x, y, z} to B= (1, 2), is 32.

J: Properties of a relation being symmetric and being anti-symmetric are negative of each other.

Wait, I think I might have mixed up F and I. Let me check.

Option F: Number of relations from A = {x, y, z} to B= (1, 2), is 64.

Yes, that's correct, because 3×2=6, 2^6=64.

Option I: ... is 32. 32 is 2^5, but 3×2=6, so 2^6=64. So I is wrong.

So F is correct.

So both A and F are correct. But perhaps the question expects only one correct answer. Alternatively, perhaps the options are presented in a way that only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should check if the question is about relations on a set, not from one set to another. Let me read the options again.

Option A is about the empty relation, which is on a set, not from one set to another.

Options B, F, I are about relations from A to B, which are different.

So the empty relation is on a set, while B, F, I are about relations between two sets.

So A and F are both correct.

But perhaps the question is designed such that only one is correct. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended only one correct answer.

Wait, perhaps I should re-examine the options again. Let me see:

Looking at the options again, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the number of relations.

Wait, when the question says "number of relations from A to B," that's the number of subsets of A×B. So for A={x,y,z}, B={1,2}, A×B has 3×2=6 elements. So the number of relations is 2^6=64, which is correct, so F is correct.

Similarly, the empty relation is not reflexive, so A is correct.

So both A and F are correct. But the options don't have both correct. Or perhaps the question allows for multiple correct options, but the user is to choose all that apply. But in this case, I have to choose one.

Wait, perhaps the question is designed to have only one correct answer. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating other options.

Wait, looking back at option C and E:

Option C: Properties of a relation being symmetric and being un-symmetric are positive of each other.

Option E: Properties of a relation being symmetric and being un-symmetric are negative of each other.

Assuming "un-symmetric" is a typo and should be "antisymmetric," then symmetric and antisymmetric are not necessarily opposites. A relation can be both symmetric and antisymmetric (e.g., the equality relation). So C and E are both incorrect.

Alternatively, if "un-symmetric" refers to asymmetric, which is when if (a,b) is in R, then (b,a) is not. So symmetric and asymmetric are opposites in the sense that a relation can't be both symmetric and asymmetric. So if a relation is symmetric, it can't be asymmetric, and vice versa. So perhaps option E is correct if it's about being negatives (i.e., mutually exclusive). But the wording is unclear.

But perhaps the correct answer is both A and F, but since the options don't allow for that, perhaps the intended answer is A and F.

Wait, perhaps I should check the other options again.

Option G: Every equivalence relation is a partial-ordering relation.

No, because equivalence relations require symmetry, while partial orders require antisymmetry and transitivity but not necessarily symmetry. So G is false.

Option H: Every partial-ordering relation is an equivalence relation.

No, because partial orders don't have to be symmetric. So H is false.

Option J: Properties of a relation being symmetric and being anti-symmetric are negatives of each other.

As I thought earlier, a relation can be both symmetric and antisymmetric (e.g., equality). So J is false.

So back to options A and F being correct.

But perhaps the question is structured so that only one is correct. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the number of relations.

Wait, let me confirm the number of relations from A to B.

If A has m elements and B has n elements, the number of relations from A to B is 2^(m×n).

In option B: A has 3, B has 3, so 2^(9)=512. So B is wrong.

Option F: A=3, B=2, so 2^(6)=64. Correct.

Option I: 2^5=32, which is wrong because 3×2=6, so 2^6=64.

So F is correct.

Similarly, A is correct.

So perhaps the correct answers are both A and F. But in the options, the user didn't mark which are correct. So perhaps I should select both, but the way the question is phrased, it's a single choice.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is both A and F. But the options only allow one letter. So maybe I made a mistake elsewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is designed such that only one is correct. Let me check again.

Wait, perhaps I should think about whether the empty relation is not reflexive. Yes, because reflexivity requires (a,a) for all a, which the empty relation lacks.

So A is correct.

F is correct.

So the correct options are A and F.

But the way the question is presented, perhaps only one option is correct. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake, but I need to proceed.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is both A and F, but looking back, the options are A to J, and the user is to select one.

Alternatively, perhaps only F is correct. But no, A is definitely correct.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the question is from a test where only one answer is correct, so perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating A.

Wait, perhaps the empty relation is considered reflexive on the empty set. Wait, but the question is about the empty relation on a non-empty set. Because if A is non-empty, the empty relation can't be reflexive. But if A is empty, the empty relation would be reflexive because it's the only subset.

Wait, but the question doesn't specify the set. Option A says "Empty relation _ is not reflexive." So perhaps it's referring to the empty relation on a non-empty set, which is not reflexive. So A is correct.

So I think both A and F are correct. But perhaps the intended answer is F, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the question is designed to have only one correct answer, so I need to pick the most correct one.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is F, as the number of relations is correctly calculated.

But since both A and F are correct, I'm a bit confused. But perhaps the intended correct answer is F, as the number of relations is a more straightforward calculation.

Wait, but the question is about which statement is true, and both A and F are true. So perhaps the correct answer includes both. But since the options are single letters, perhaps the intended answer is F, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake elsewhere. Let me try to think again.

Wait, perhaps the empty relation is considered as reflexive only if the set is empty. So if the set A is empty, the empty relation is reflexive because the condition is vacuously true. But if A is non-empty, then the empty relation is not reflexive. So option A is correct because it's referring to the empty relation on a non-empty set.

So, to sum up, both A and F are correct. But since the options are single letters, perhaps the correct answer is both A and F. But the way the question is presented, I think the correct answer is both A and F. However, since the user expects a single letter, perhaps the intended answer is F, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the number of relations from A to B is 2^(|A|×|B|). So for A=3, B=2, it's 64, so F is correct.

In conclusion, both A and F are correct. But perhaps the intended answer is F, so I'll go with F.
</think>

The correct statements are A and F. However, since the question expects a single answer, the most direct correct statement is F.

F
