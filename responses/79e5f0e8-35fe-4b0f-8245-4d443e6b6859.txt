The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

The fixed assets and related depreciation of a company are currently tracked on a password-protected spreadsheet. The information technology governance committee is designing a new enterprise-wide system and needs to determine whether the current fixed asset process should be included because the current system seems to be working properly. What long-term solution should the committee recommend?

Options:

A: Purchasing a stand-alone fixed asset program for managing the assets and related depreciation
B: Adopting the fixed asset module of the new system for integration.
C: Leaving the decision to the individual departments to choose their preferred method
D: Adopting a cloud-based fixed asset management system
E: Incorporating blockchain technology for asset tracking and depreciation
F: Implementing an open-source fixed asset system to manage the assets and related depreciation
G: Continuing to use the current spreadsheet process because there have been no issues in this area.
H: Implementing an AI-based fixed asset system to manage the assets and related depreciation
I: Developing a new fixed asset system to manage the assets and related depreciation
J: Outsourcing the management of fixed assets to a third-party company

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about IT governance and fixed asset management. Let me try to work through it step by step.

The question says that a company currently tracks fixed assets and their depreciation using a password-protected spreadsheet. The IT governance committee is looking at a new enterprise-wide system and is deciding whether to include the current fixed asset process. The current system works properly, but they're evaluating if it's better to move to something else.

The options are A through J, each suggesting a different approach. I need to figure out which long-term solution the committee should recommend.

First, I'll think about the advantages of the current system. The spreadsheet is working fine, and it's password-protected, so maybe it's secure enough. But spreadsheets can have issues like being difficult to integrate with other systems, potential for human error, lack of scalability, and maybe not being as secure as a dedicated system, even though it's password-protected.

The committee is designing a new enterprise-wide system. So, they're probably looking to consolidate and integrate various processes into a single, unified system. If the current fixed asset process isn't integrated, it could lead to inefficiencies or data silos. Plus, as the company grows, a spreadsheet might not scale well.

Looking at the options:

A: Purchasing a stand-alone fixed asset program. This might integrate better than a spreadsheet but still might not tie into the new enterprise system, leading to separate systems to manage.

B: Adopting the fixed asset module of the new system. This makes sense because it would integrate with the rest of the enterprise system, ensuring data consistency and easier management. It also offers scalability and better security.

C: Letting departments choose. This could lead to inconsistency and more complexity, making governance harder. The committee probably wants a unified approach.

D: Cloud-based system. Cloud solutions are good, but unless it's part of the new system, it might still be a separate solution. Also, the question is about the new enterprise system, so maybe this isn't the best fit unless it's integrated.

E: Blockchain for asset tracking. While blockchain is secure, it might be overkill and not necessary if the current system is working. Plus, it's a newer technology with possible learning curves and costs.

F: Open-source system. This could be cost-effective, but again, unless it's part of the new system, it's another tool to manage. Also, support and updates might be an issue.

G: Continue with the spreadsheet. The question says the current system is working, but spreadsheets have limitations. The committee is considering a new system, so maybe they're looking for improvements beyond what the spreadsheet offers.

H: AI-based system. AI can be useful, but it's a niche solution. The question doesn't mention any specific need for AI, and integrating it might complicate things if it's not part of the new system.

I: Developing a new system. This is resource-intensive and might not be necessary if the new enterprise system has a module that can handle it.

J: Outsourcing. This shifts the responsibility but might not provide the same level of control or integration with the new system.

So, considering all this, the best long-term solution would likely be to adopt the fixed asset module of the new system. This ensures integration, scalability, and alignment with the company's broader IT strategy. It avoids the fragmentation of having separate systems and leverages existing investments in the new enterprise system.

The committee should recommend adopting the fixed asset module of the new system for integration, as it ensures scalability, data consistency, and alignment with the company's IT strategy.

Answer: B
