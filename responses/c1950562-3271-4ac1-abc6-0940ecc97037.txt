Okay, so I need to figure out which type of unemployment Theo's situation falls into. Let's break down the question. Theo lost his job at the public swimming pool because the pool closed for the winter. So, the pool is seasonal, right? It probably operates during the summer when more people swim and then closes in the winter when it's too cold.

Looking at the options, I remember that different types of unemployment have different causes. Let me list out what each term means:

A: Natural unemployment is the normal rate of unemployment that exists in an economy even when it's healthy. It includes frictional and structural unemployment.

B: Underemployment refers to people working in jobs that don't fully utilize their skills, or they might be working part-time when they want full-time work.

C: Discouraged worker is when someone stops looking for work because they think there are no jobs available, so they're no longer counted in the unemployment rate.

D: Structural unemployment happens when there's a mismatch between the skills workers have and the jobs available, often due to technological changes or shifts in the economy.

E: Jobless recovery is when the economy is recovering but hasn't created enough jobs yet, so unemployment remains high.

F: Cyclical unemployment occurs during economic downturns, when demand for goods and services drops, leading to layoffs.

G: Seasonal unemployment is when jobs are tied to certain times of the year, like retail during the holidays or construction in good weather. So, when the season ends, people lose their jobs.

H: Frictional unemployment is when people are between jobs or entering the workforce, causing temporary unemployment as they search for work.

I: Long-term unemployment refers to people who are unemployed for a long time, usually longer than a certain period, often due to economic downturns or lack of demand for their skills.

J: Involuntary unemployment is when people are unable to find a job despite their willingness to work, which can include cases where the economy isn't providing enough jobs.

So, Theo lost his job because the pool closed for the winter. That's a seasonal closure, so his unemployment is due to the seasonality of his job. That points directly to seasonal unemployment, which is option G.

Wait, let me make sure I'm not confusing it with other types. Natural unemployment is more about the general rate, not specific reasons. Structural is about skills mismatch, which isn't the case here. Cyclical is due to the economic cycle, but this is more about the time of year. Frictional is about transitions, but Theo isn't necessarily looking for another job immediately; the pool just isn't open. So yes, seasonal makes the most sense.

Theo's unemployment is due to the seasonal closure of the swimming pool, which is a specific time-related factor. This aligns with seasonal unemployment.
