Okay, so I have this system of equations to solve. The problem is:

888x + 889y = 890  
891x + 892y = 893  

And I need to find the value of x - y. The options are given from A to J, so I have to pick the correct one.

Hmm, let me think. I'm a bit rusty on solving systems of equations, but I remember there are methods like substitution, elimination, or maybe matrix methods. Since these are two equations with two variables, elimination might work here.

Looking at the coefficients, the numbers are pretty close to each other. Maybe subtracting the equations could help simplify things. Let me write them down again:

Equation 1: 888x + 889y = 890  
Equation 2: 891x + 892y = 893

If I subtract Equation 1 from Equation 2, what happens? Let's see:

(891x - 888x) + (892y - 889y) = 893 - 890  
That simplifies to:  
3x + 3y = 3

Oh, that's nice. I can factor out the 3:

3(x + y) = 3  
Divide both sides by 3:  
x + y = 1

So now I have x + y = 1. That's one equation, but I need another to find both x and y. Let me try to express one variable in terms of the other using this equation. Let's say x = 1 - y.

Now I can substitute x in one of the original equations. Let's pick Equation 1 because the numbers are a bit smaller.

Substituting x into Equation 1:  
888(1 - y) + 889y = 890  
Let me expand this:  
888*1 - 888y + 889y = 890  
Which is:  
888 + (889y - 888y) = 890  
Simplify the y terms:  
888 + y = 890

Now subtract 888 from both sides:  
y = 890 - 888  
y = 2

Wait, so y is 2. Now, since x + y = 1, x = 1 - y = 1 - 2 = -1.

So x is -1 and y is 2. Now, the question asks for x - y. Let me compute that:

x - y = (-1) - 2 = -3.

Looking back at the options, E is -3. So the answer should be E.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Sometimes I might miscalculate when dealing with larger numbers.

Let me substitute x and y back into both equations to verify.

First, Equation 1: 888*(-1) + 889*2  
= -888 + 1778  
= 890. Correct, that matches the right side.

Equation 2: 891*(-1) + 892*2  
= -891 + 1784  
= 893. Correct again.

So both equations are satisfied. Therefore, x is -1, y is 2, so x - y is indeed -3. That must be the right answer.

The system of equations is solved by elimination, leading to x = -1 and y = 2. Thus, x - y = -3.
