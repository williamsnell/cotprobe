Alright, let's tackle this logic problem step by step. So, the question is asking which of the given options is an immediate consequence of the premises in propositional logic (PL). The premises are:

1. (N ⊃ ~O) ⊃ (O ∨ Q)
2. P ⊃ (N ⊃ ~O)
3. N ⊃ P

And the options are labeled from A to J. I need to figure out which one follows directly from these premises in one step.

First, I should recall some basic rules of propositional logic, particularly focusing on implication and contrapositive, hypothetical syllogism, and maybe even modus ponens or tollens. Let's break down each premise and see how they can be connected.

Starting with the first premise: (N ⊃ ~O) ⊃ (O ∨ Q). This seems a bit complex. Let's simplify it. Let me represent it as if (N → ~O) then (O ∨ Q). Alternatively, in PL, this can be rewritten using material implication: ~ (N → ~O) ∨ (O ∨ Q). But perhaps it's better to look for contrapositives or other forms.

The second premise is P ⊃ (N ⊃ ~O). That can be read as P implies that N implies ~O. Alternatively, using material implication, this is equivalent to ~P ∨ (~N ∨ ~O). Wait, but maybe there's a better way to handle this.

The third premise is N ⊃ P, which is straightforward: N implies P.

Let me see if I can derive anything from these. Maybe using hypothetical syllogism, which says that if A → B and B → C, then A → C. Let's see if that applies here.

Looking at premises 2 and 3: premise 2 is P → (N → ~O), and premise 3 is N → P. So, if I apply hypothetical syllogism to these two, perhaps I can derive something.

Wait, but hypothetical syllogism requires the antecedent of one to be the consequent of another. Let's see: premise 3 is N → P, so N is the antecedent, P is the consequent. Premise 2 is P → (N → ~O). So P is the antecedent here. So if I apply hypothetical syllogism, I can combine N → P and P → (N → ~O) to get N → (N → ~O). But that seems a bit odd. Let me write that down:

From N → P (premise 3) and P → (N → ~O) (premise 2), by hypothetical syllogism, we get N → (N → ~O). Hmm, that's N implies (N implies ~O). Now, what can we do with that?

In logic, N → (N → ~O) can be rewritten as ~N ∨ (~N ∨ ~O), which simplifies to ~N ∨ ~O. Because if both disjuncts are ~N, it's the same as ~N. So, this simplifies to ~N ∨ ~O, which is equivalent to N ⊃ ~O. Wait, that's interesting because that's exactly the antecedent of the first premise. The first premise is (N → ~O) → (O ∨ Q). So, if we have N → ~O, that would make the antecedent of the first premise true, thus making the consequent (O ∨ Q) true.

Wait, so if I have N → ~O, then according to the first premise, (N → ~O) → (O ∨ Q), so (O ∨ Q) must be true. Therefore, O ∨ Q would be an immediate consequence.

Alternatively, let me see if I can get O ∨ Q directly. From premise 3, N → P. From premise 2, P → (N → ~O). So, combining these, as above, we get N → (N → ~O), which is equivalent to ~N ∨ ~O. But ~N ∨ ~O is the same as N → ~O. Now, the first premise says that if N → ~O, then O ∨ Q. So, since we have N → ~O, then by modus ponens on the first premise, we can conclude O ∨ Q. So that would make option B: O ∨ Q the answer.

Let me check the options again. Option B is O ∨ Q, which is exactly what we derived. So that seems to fit.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing any other possible conclusions. Let's see the other options:

A: P → O. I don't think we can derive that directly. From N → P and P → (N → ~O), we get N → (N → ~O), which we've already used to get O ∨ Q. But P → O would require that whenever P is true, O is true, but we have that when N is true, O is false (from N → ~O). But P could be true when N is false, so O could be either true or false, depending on other factors. So I don't think A is necessarily true.

C: N → Q. Hmm, not sure. From N → ~O, and the first premise, we get O ∨ Q. So if N is true, then ~O is true, so O is false, which makes O ∨ Q reduce to Q. So if N is true, then Q must be true. Therefore, N → Q. Wait, that's option C. So maybe C is also a possible conclusion.

Wait, so if N is true, then from N → ~O, O is false. Then, from the first premise, (N → ~O) → (O ∨ Q), and since N → ~O is true, O ∨ Q must be true. But since O is false when N is true, Q must be true. Therefore, N → Q. So that would make option C also a valid conclusion. But wait, is that an immediate consequence?

Wait, but the question is about immediate consequences, meaning one step. So let's see:

From premise 3: N → P.

From premise 2: P → (N → ~O). So combining these, via hypothetical syllogism, we get N → (N → ~O), which simplifies to ~N ∨ ~O, as before. Then, the first premise is (N → ~O) → (O ∨ Q). So, if we have (N → ~O) as a fact, then O ∨ Q is true. So that's one step.

Alternatively, from (N → ~O), we can derive O ∨ Q in one step using modus ponens on the first premise.

So, O ∨ Q is an immediate consequence, which is option B.

Wait, but earlier I thought that when N is true, Q must be true, leading to N → Q, which is option C. So is that also an immediate consequence?

Let me think again. So, from the premises, can I derive N → Q in one step?

We have:

1. (N → ~O) → (O ∨ Q)
2. P → (N → ~O)
3. N → P

From 3 and 2, using hypothetical syllogism, we get N → (N → ~O), which is equivalent to ~N ∨ ~O.

Now, if we have ~N ∨ ~O, and from 1, (N → ~O) → (O ∨ Q). Let me see if I can derive N → Q.

Let's assume N is true. Then, from ~N ∨ ~O, since N is true, ~N is false, so ~O must be true. So O is false. Then, from the first premise, since N → ~O is true (because N is true and ~O is true), then O ∨ Q must be true. But since O is false, Q must be true. Therefore, if N is true, Q is true, so N → Q.

But is this an immediate consequence? It seems like it's two steps: first getting ~N ∨ ~O, then assuming N to derive Q. But the question is about immediate consequences, which are one-step inferences.

So, perhaps the immediate consequence is O ∨ Q, which can be derived in one step from the first premise and the fact that (N → ~O) is true.

Alternatively, perhaps N → Q can be derived more directly. Let me see:

We have N → P (premise 3), and P → (N → ~O) (premise 2). So combining these, as before, we get N → (N → ~O), which is ~N ∨ ~O.

Now, from ~N ∨ ~O and the first premise, which is (N → ~O) → (O ∨ Q), can we derive N → Q?

Let me represent the first premise as: If (N → ~O) is true, then (O ∨ Q) is true. But (N → ~O) is equivalent to ~N ∨ ~O, which we've already established.

So, if (N → ~O) is true, then O ∨ Q is true. So, when (N → ~O) is true, O ∨ Q is true. But (N → ~O) is equivalent to ~N ∨ ~O, which is the same as what we have from premises 2 and 3.

Wait, perhaps I can use modus ponens on the first premise. Since (N → ~O) is true (from premises 2 and 3), then O ∨ Q must be true. So that's one step, making B correct.

Alternatively, considering that O ∨ Q is equivalent to ~O ∨ Q, which is the same as ~O ∨ Q, which is also equivalent to Q ∨ ~O. So, if I have O ∨ Q, that's the same as ~O ∨ Q, which is the same as Q ∨ ~O. So, perhaps I can also derive ~O ∨ Q, which is option I.

Wait, but option I is ~O ∨ Q, which is the same as O ∨ Q, so that's also a possible conclusion. But since O ∨ Q is option B, and ~O ∨ Q is option I, both would be correct. But looking back, the first premise is (N → ~O) → (O ∨ Q). So, when (N → ~O) is true, O ∨ Q is true, which is the same as ~O ∨ Q. So, both B and I could be considered correct, but looking at the options, B is O ∨ Q and I is ~O ∨ Q. Wait, no, O ∨ Q is the same as ~O ∨ Q, because O and ~O are complements. Wait, no, O ∨ Q is not the same as ~O ∨ Q. Wait, O ∨ Q is equivalent to Q ∨ O, and ~O ∨ Q is equivalent to Q ∨ ~O. These are different unless Q is a tautology, which it's not.

Wait, no, O ∨ Q is not equivalent to ~O ∨ Q. So, perhaps I made a mistake there. Let me clarify: O ∨ Q is the same as (O ∨ Q), which is different from ~O ∨ Q. So, if I have O ∨ Q, that's one thing, but ~O ∨ Q is another.

Wait, but in our case, when (N → ~O) is true, O ∨ Q is true. So, O ∨ Q is true. That's option B. So, that's a direct consequence. Alternatively, if I have O ∨ Q, I can also write it as ~O ∨ Q, which would be option I. But are they both correct? Let me check the options again.

Looking back:

I: ~O ∨ Q

B: O ∨ Q

So, if O ∨ Q is true, then ~O ∨ Q is also true because if O is true, then ~O is false, but Q is true. If O is false, then ~O is true, making ~O ∨ Q true regardless. So, O ∨ Q and ~O ∨ Q are actually equivalent because they are both equivalent to Q ∨ (O and ~O), which is just Q ∨ something. Wait, no, that's not correct. O ∨ Q is equivalent to ~O → Q, and ~O ∨ Q is also equivalent to O → Q. Wait, no, O ∨ Q is equivalent to ~O → Q, whereas ~O ∨ Q is equivalent to O → Q. So, they are not the same. So, if I derive O ∨ Q, that's B, which is correct. But can I derive ~O ∨ Q (option I) as well?

Wait, let's think differently. From the premises, we have:

1. (N → ~O) → (O ∨ Q)
2. P → (N → ~O)
3. N → P

From 3 and 2, we get N → (N → ~O), which is ~N ∨ ~O.

Now, the first premise is (N → ~O) → (O ∨ Q). So, if (N → ~O) is true, then O ∨ Q is true. But (N → ~O) is equivalent to ~N ∨ ~O, which we have from premises 2 and 3. So, (N → ~O) is true, hence O ∨ Q is true. So, O ∨ Q is an immediate consequence, which is option B.

Alternatively, if I have O ∨ Q, can I derive ~O ∨ Q? Well, O ∨ Q is equivalent to ~O → Q, which is the same as Q ∨ ~O. So, yes, O ∨ Q is equivalent to ~O ∨ Q, so both B and I are the same. Wait, no, O ∨ Q is the same as Q ∨ O, and ~O ∨ Q is the same as Q ∨ ~O. These are not the same unless O and ~O are both present, which they're not. So, perhaps I made a mistake in thinking they're equivalent.

Wait, no, O ∨ Q is equivalent to ~ ( ~O ∧ ~Q ), which is De Morgan's law. Similarly, ~O ∨ Q is equivalent to ~ (O ∧ ~Q ). So, they are not equivalent. Therefore, O ∨ Q and ~O ∨ Q are different.

So, from the premises, we can derive O ∨ Q (option B) as an immediate consequence. Additionally, since O ∨ Q is true, then ~O ∨ Q is also true because if O is true, ~O is false but Q is true; if O is false, ~O is true, making ~O ∨ Q true. Wait, but that's not necessarily an immediate consequence. It's a tautological consequence, but not necessarily an immediate one-step inference.

So, perhaps the immediate consequence is only O ∨ Q, which is option B.

Wait, but let me think again. From the premises, can I also derive N → Q in one step? Because if N is true, then from N → ~O, we have ~O, and then from the first premise, since (N → ~O) is true, O ∨ Q is true. Since O is false, Q must be true. So, N → Q. But is that an immediate consequence?

To derive N → Q, I would need to use hypothetical syllogism or other rules. Let's see:

From premise 3: N → P.

From premise 2: P → (N → ~O).

So, combining these, as before, we get N → (N → ~O), which is ~N ∨ ~O.

Now, from the first premise: (N → ~O) → (O ∨ Q).

So, (N → ~O) is equivalent to ~N ∨ ~O, which we have. Therefore, (N → ~O) is true, so (O ∨ Q) is true.

Now, from (O ∨ Q) being true, can I derive N → Q?

Wait, perhaps using contrapositive. If I have O ∨ Q, that's equivalent to ~O → Q. So, if I can derive ~O → Q, that would be the same as O ∨ Q. But how does that help me get N → Q?

Alternatively, perhaps using the fact that N → ~O and O ∨ Q leads to N → Q.

Wait, let's assume N is true. Then, from N → ~O, O is false. From O ∨ Q, since O is false, Q must be true. Therefore, if N is true, Q is true, so N → Q.

But is this an immediate consequence? It seems like it's a two-step reasoning: first, derive O ∨ Q, then assuming N, derive Q. So, perhaps N → Q is not an immediate consequence but a derived one after two steps.

Therefore, the immediate consequence is O ∨ Q, which is option B.

Wait, but earlier I thought that N → Q could be derived in one step. Let me see:

If I have N → (N → ~O), which is ~N ∨ ~O, and also have the first premise: (N → ~O) → (O ∨ Q). So, (N → ~O) is ~N ∨ ~O, which is true, so O ∨ Q is true.

Now, can I derive N → Q from these? Let's see:

If N is true, then from ~N ∨ ~O, ~O must be true. So, O is false. Then, from O ∨ Q, since O is false, Q must be true. So, N → Q.

But is this an immediate consequence? It seems like it's a two-step process: first, getting O ∨ Q, then assuming N to derive Q. So, perhaps it's not an immediate consequence but a result after two steps.

Therefore, the immediate consequence in one step is O ∨ Q, which is option B.

Wait, but let me check the options again. Option I is ~O ∨ Q, which is O ∨ Q in reverse. Since O ∨ Q is equivalent to Q ∨ O, which is the same as ~O ∨ Q, because O and ~O are complements. Wait, no, that's not correct. O ∨ Q is not equivalent to ~O ∨ Q. They are different. O ∨ Q is equivalent to ~ ( ~O ∧ ~Q ), while ~O ∨ Q is equivalent to ~ (O ∧ ~Q ). So, they are not the same.

Wait, but if O ∨ Q is true, then ~O ∨ Q must also be true, because if O is true, ~O is false but Q is true, so ~O ∨ Q is true. If O is false, ~O is true, so ~O ∨ Q is true regardless of Q. Therefore, O ∨ Q implies ~O ∨ Q. So, if O ∨ Q is an immediate consequence, then ~O ∨ Q is also a consequence, but perhaps not immediate. Similarly, if ~O ∨ Q is true, O ∨ Q may or may not be true.

But in our case, we derived O ∨ Q as an immediate consequence. So, option B is correct.

Wait, but let me think again. The first premise is (N → ~O) → (O ∨ Q). So, if (N → ~O) is true, then O ∨ Q is true. From premises 2 and 3, we have (N → ~O) is true. Therefore, O ∨ Q is true. So, that's an immediate consequence, which is option B.

Alternatively, if I have O ∨ Q, can I derive ~O ∨ Q? Yes, as I thought before, but it's not an immediate consequence from the premises. It's a consequence from the derived O ∨ Q.

So, the immediate consequence is O ∨ Q, which is option B.

Wait, but looking back at the options, option I is ~O ∨ Q, which is equivalent to O → Q. So, if I can derive O → Q, that would be equivalent to ~O ∨ Q. But can I derive O → Q in one step?

Let me see. From the premises:

1. (N → ~O) → (O ∨ Q)
2. P → (N → ~O)
3. N → P

From 3 and 2, we get N → (N → ~O), which is ~N ∨ ~O.

Now, from premise 1, (N → ~O) → (O ∨ Q). Since (N → ~O) is ~N ∨ ~O, which is true, then O ∨ Q is true.

So, O ∨ Q is true. Now, can I derive O → Q? That would be equivalent to ~O ∨ Q, which is option I.

But O ∨ Q is equivalent to ~O → Q, which is the contrapositive. So, O ∨ Q is equivalent to ~O → Q, which is the same as saying if O is not true, then Q is true. But that's not the same as O → Q, which is ~O ∨ Q.

Wait, no, O → Q is ~O ∨ Q, which is the same as Q ∨ ~O. And O ∨ Q is the same as Q ∨ O. So, they are different. Therefore, O ∨ Q is not equivalent to ~O ∨ Q. So, if I have O ∨ Q, I can't directly derive ~O ∨ Q as an immediate consequence. It's a different statement.

Therefore, the immediate consequence is O ∨ Q, which is option B.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me try another approach. Let's use a truth table to see which options are entailed by the premises.

But that might take too long, but perhaps I can think of possible truth values.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is option I: ~O ∨ Q, which is equivalent to O → Q. Let me see.

From the premises, we have:

1. (N → ~O) → (O ∨ Q)
2. P → (N → ~O)
3. N → P

From 3 and 2, as before, we get N → (N → ~O), which is ~N ∨ ~O.

Now, from premise 1, (N → ~O) → (O ∨ Q). Since (N → ~O) is ~N ∨ ~O, which is true, then O ∨ Q is true.

So, O ∨ Q is true.

Now, can I derive ~O ∨ Q? Well, if O is true, then ~O is false, but Q could be true or false. But from O ∨ Q being true, if O is true, Q can be anything. If O is false, then Q must be true.

Wait, but ~O ∨ Q is equivalent to O → Q. So, if I have O ∨ Q, does that imply O → Q?

No, because O ∨ Q is equivalent to ~O → Q, which is the contrapositive. So, O ∨ Q is equivalent to ~O → Q, which is the same as saying if O is not the case, then Q is the case. But O → Q is ~O ∨ Q, which is the same as O → Q.

Wait, no, O ∨ Q is equivalent to ~ ( ~O ∧ ~Q ), which is De Morgan's law. O → Q is equivalent to ~O ∨ Q, which is the same as Q ∨ ~O.

So, O ∨ Q is not the same as ~O ∨ Q. Therefore, if I have O ∨ Q, I can't derive ~O ∨ Q directly.

Therefore, the immediate consequence is O ∨ Q, which is option B.

Wait, but another approach: using the hypothetical syllogism again. Let's see:

From premise 3: N → P.

From premise 2: P → (N → ~O).

So, combining these, N → (N → ~O).

Now, from the first premise: (N → ~O) → (O ∨ Q).

So, since (N → ~O) is true, then (O ∨ Q) is true. Therefore, O ∨ Q is an immediate consequence.

So, yes, option B is correct.

I think I've gone in circles a bit, but I'm confident that option B is the immediate consequence.
</think>

The question involves determining which of the given options is an immediate consequence of the premises in propositional logic (PL). The premises are:

1. \((N \supset \neg O) \supset (O \vee Q)\)
2. \(P \supset (N \supset \neg O)\)
3. \(N \supset P\)

To solve this, we analyze the logical relationships between the premises and the options. 

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Premise 3**: \(N \supset P\) means that if \(N\) is true, then \(P\) must also be true.
2. **Premise 2**: \(P \supset (N \supset \neg O)\) means that if \(P\) is true, then \(N \supset \neg O\) is also true.
3. Combining Premises 2 and 3 using hypothetical syllogism, we derive:
   \[
   N \supset (N \supset \neg O)
   \]
   This simplifies to \(\neg N \vee (\neg N \vee \neg O)\), which further simplifies to \(\neg N \vee \neg O\). This is equivalent to \(N \supset \neg O\).
4. **Premise 1**: \((N \supset \neg O) \supset (O \vee Q)\) states that if \(N \supset \neg O\) is true, then \(O \vee Q\) must also be true.
5. From step 3, we have \(N \supset \neg O\), which makes the antecedent of Premise 1 true. Therefore, by modus ponens, the consequent \(O \vee Q\) must be true.

Thus, \(O \vee Q\) is an immediate consequence of the premises.

### Evaluation of Options:

- **A: \(P \supset O\)**: This cannot be directly derived from the premises.
- **B: \(O \vee Q\)**: This is derived as shown above.
- **C: \(N \supset Q\)**: While \(N \supset Q\) can be inferred from the premises, it requires two steps and is not an immediate consequence.
- **D: \(O \vee P\)**: This is not supported by the premises.
- **E: \(\neg N\)**: This cannot be directly derived.
- **F: \(P\)**: This is not supported by the premises.
- **G: \(N \supset \neg O\)**: This is derived but not the immediate conclusion.
- **H: \(P \supset Q\)**: This cannot be directly derived.
- **I: \(\neg O \vee Q\)**: This is equivalent to \(O \vee Q\) but is not the immediate conclusion.
- **J: \(\neg P\)**: This cannot be directly derived.

### Conclusion:

The immediate consequence is \(O \vee Q\), which corresponds to **Option B**.

**Answer:** B
