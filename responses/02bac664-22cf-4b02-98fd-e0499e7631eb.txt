Okay, so I've got this question about the Durbin-Watson statistic and the first-order autocorrelation coefficient. Hmm, I remember that the Durbin-Watson (DW) statistic is used to detect the presence of autocorrelation in the residuals from a regression analysis. But wait, what exactly does the DW statistic tell us?

I think the DW statistic ranges somewhere between 0 and 4. Oh right, when the value is close to 2, it suggests that there's no autocorrelation. So if it's around 2, the autocorrelation coefficient rho is near zero. But what happens when the DW statistic is close to zero?

Wait, let me think. The formula for the Durbin-Watson statistic is something like DW = 2(1 - rho), where rho is the first-order autocorrelation coefficient. So if DW is close to zero, that would mean 2(1 - rho) is near zero. Let me solve for rho.

If DW ≈ 0, then 2(1 - rho) ≈ 0 → 1 - rho ≈ 0 → rho ≈ 1. But wait, that would mean positive autocorrelation. So rho would be close to +1. But I also remember that if DW is close to 4, rho is close to -1, indicating negative autocorrelation.

Wait, no, let me double-check. The formula I remember is DW = 2(1 - rho). So if DW is 0, then 2(1 - rho) = 0 → 1 - rho = 0 → rho = 1. So when DW is near 0, rho is near +1. But wait, that can't be right because if there's positive autocorrelation, the DW statistic would be lower, closer to 0. Alternatively, maybe I have the formula reversed. Let me think again.

Alternatively, the Durbin-Watson statistic is calculated as (sum of squared differences between consecutive residuals) divided by the sum of squared residuals. So when the residuals are positively autocorrelated, the differences between consecutive residuals would be small, leading to a smaller sum of squared differences, hence a smaller DW statistic. So a DW close to 0 would indicate strong positive autocorrelation, meaning rho is close to +1.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I've also heard that when DW is around 2, there's no autocorrelation. So if DW is near 0, it's positive autocorrelation, and near 4, it's negative. So the first-order autocorrelation coefficient rho would be close to +1 when DW is near 0. So looking at the options, which one says close to +1?

Looking at the options, option J is "Close to plus one." But wait, another thought: suppose the DW is close to zero, does that mean rho is close to +1 or -1? Because if there's positive autocorrelation, the residuals tend to repeat their signs, so the difference between consecutive residuals would be small, leading to a low DW. So yes, rho would be close to +1. So the answer should be J.

Wait, but let me make sure. Some sources say that the Durbin-Watson statistic approximately equals 2(1 - rho). So if the DW is near 0, then 2(1 - rho) ≈ 0 → rho ≈1. So rho is close to +1, so the answer is J.
</think>

The Durbin-Watson (DW) statistic is used to detect autocorrelation in regression residuals. It ranges between 0 and 4, with a value close to 2 indicating no autocorrelation. The formula for the DW statistic is approximately \( DW = 2(1 - \rho) \), where \( \rho \) is the first-order autocorrelation coefficient. If the DW statistic is close to 0, then \( 2(1 - \rho) \) is near 0, implying \( \rho \) is close to +1, indicating strong positive autocorrelation. Therefore, the first-order autocorrelation coefficient is close to plus one.

Answer: J
