Okay, so I've got this question about banking and the money supply. Let me try to break it down step by step. The question is: If $1,000 is deposited in a commercial bank and the required reserve ratio is 15%, what's the potential change in the total money supply?

Hmm, I remember something about the money multiplier effect from my economics class. The idea is that when a bank receives deposits, it doesn't keep all of it as reserves; it lends out a portion, which can then be redeposited, and so on. This process can create more money in the economy.

Wait, the required reserve ratio (r) is 15%, so that's 0.15 in decimal. The formula I think is that the money multiplier is 1 divided by the reserve ratio. So 1 / 0.15 equals approximately 6.6667. That means each dollar of reserves can support about $6.6667 in the money supply.

But wait, the initial deposit is $1,000. So the total money created would be the initial deposit multiplied by the money multiplier. So 1,000 * (1/0.15) = 1,000 * 6.6667 ≈ $6,666.67. But looking at the options, I don't see exactly $6,666. The closest option is D: $5,667, but that's lower. Did I miss something?

Wait, maybe I'm confusing something. The initial deposit of $1,000 is the starting point. The first thing the bank does is keep 15% as reserves, which is $150, and lend out the remaining $850. Then, when that $850 is deposited elsewhere, the next bank keeps 15% of $850, which is $127.50, and lends out $722.50. And this process continues.

So the total money created is the sum of all these loans. The formula for the total money supply change is the initial deposit divided by the reserve ratio. So 1,000 / 0.15 ≈ $6,666.67. But none of the options have that exact number. Wait, looking back at the options, option D is $5,667, which is about 1,000 multiplied by 5.6667, which is roughly 1/(0.176). Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, maybe I should think about it differently. The money supply change is the initial deposit multiplied by (1/r) minus the initial deposit itself because the initial deposit is part of the money supply. Wait, no, the initial deposit is the starting point. The change would be the total created from it, which is 1,000 / 0.15 ≈ 6,666.67. So the change is an increase of about $6,666.67 in the money supply.

Looking at the options again, option D is $5,667, which is about 1,000 * 5.6667, which is 1/(0.176). That doesn't match. Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me double-check: 1 divided by 0.15 is approximately 6.6667. So 1,000 * 6.6667 is 6,666.67. But the options don't have that. The closest higher option is E: $6,000, and the next is F: $7,000.

Wait, but perhaps the question is asking for the potential change, which is the maximum possible increase. Alternatively, maybe the question is asking for the maximum expansion, which would be 6,666.67, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is E: $6,000, but that's an approximation.

Wait, looking at the options again: Option D is $5,667, which is 1,000 * 5.6667, which is 1/(0.176). That doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is different. Wait, maybe the question is asking about the change from the original deposit, so the total money supply increases by 6,666.67, but the options don't have that. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the maximum possible money created from the initial deposit, which is 1,000 / 0.15 ≈ 6,666.67. But the options don't include that. So looking again, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, 1,000 divided by 0.15 is indeed approximately 6,666.67. So if that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is E: $6,000, but that's an approximation. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects the change to be 1,000 * (1 / 0.15) = 6,666.67, but since that's not available, maybe the closest is D: $5,667, but that doesn't add up.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the multiplier. The money multiplier is 1/(1 - r), but wait, that's when the reserve ratio is r, so the multiplier is 1/r. Wait, no, the formula is 1/(r), because the bank can lend out the rest. Wait, no, the money multiplier is actually 1/(r), because each dollar of reserves supports 1/r dollars of deposits. So yes, 1/0.15 is about 6.6667.

Wait, but looking at the options, D is $5,667, which is 1,000 * 5.6667, which is approximately 1/(0.176). Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe the question is about the change in the money supply beyond the initial deposit. Oh wait, the initial deposit is part of the money supply, so the change would be the total minus the initial. So 6,666.67 - 1,000 = 5,666.67, which is approximately $5,667. So that would be option D.

Oh! That makes sense. Because the question is asking for the potential change in the total money supply resulting from the deposit. So the initial deposit is $1,000, and the total money created is $6,666.67, so the change is an increase of $5,666.67, which rounds to $5,667. So the correct answer is D.

The potential change in the total money supply resulting from the deposit is calculated using the money multiplier effect. With a required reserve ratio of 15% (0.15), the money multiplier is 1/0.15 ≈ 6.6667. The total money created from the $1,000 deposit is $1,000 × 6.6667 ≈ $6,666.67. However, the question asks for the change in the total money supply, which is the increase beyond the initial deposit. Subtracting the initial $1,000 from the total gives $6,666.67 - $1,000 ≈ $5,666.67, which rounds to $5,667.

Answer: D
