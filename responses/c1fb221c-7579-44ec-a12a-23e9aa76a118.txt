Okay, so I need to answer this multiple-choice question about Weber and the 'spirit of capitalism.' Hmm, I remember that Weber wrote about this in his work "The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism." From what I recall, he argued that certain Protestant groups, particularly Calvinists, played a key role in shaping the values that contributed to capitalism.

Let me go through the options one by one. Option A is about religious pluralism. Weber did discuss how different religious movements influenced society, but I don't think he directly linked the spirit of capitalism to pluralism. More about specific groups than pluralism itself.

Option B mentions inspirational Protestant groups reviving religious ideas. That sounds a bit vague. I think Weber was more specific about Calvinists and their particular doctrines, like predestination, which led to certain behaviors.

Option C is about the fall of feudalism and rise of industrialism. While these economic changes were happening, Weber's focus was more on the cultural and religious factors driving the capitalist spirit, not just the structural changes.

Option D talks about paper currency in the Middle Ages. That seems unrelated. The introduction of paper money is more of an economic development, not directly tied to Weber's arguments about the spirit of capitalism.

Option E is about new religious movements rejecting traditional labor. Again, Weber was specific about Calvinists and their work ethic, so this might be a bit off.

Option F is the spread of secularism. Weber actually focused on how religious ideas, especially Protestant ones, influenced economic behavior, so secularism might be the opposite of what he was saying.

Option G is Calvinists who engaged in ascetic practices for signs of salvation. This rings a bell. Calvinists believed in predestination, so they worked hard and lived frugally as a sign of their election, which Weber linked to the capitalist work ethic. This seems correct.

Option H is the expansion of trade during the Renaissance. While trade expanded, Weber's focus was more on the religious motivations rather than the economic activities themselves.

Option I is the development of the scientific method during the Enlightenment. That's more about rationality and science, not directly about the roots of capitalist spirit as Weber discussed.

Option J is the birth of democracy in ancient Greece. That's much earlier and unrelated; Weber was looking at more recent religious movements.

So putting it all together, the best fit is option G: Calvinists who engaged in ascetic practices to gain signs of salvation. Weber connected their religious beliefs to the Protestant work ethic, which underpinned the spirit of capitalism.

The correct answer is G: Calvinists who engaged in ascetic practices to gain signs of salvation. Weber linked their religious beliefs to the Protestant work ethic, which underpinned the spirit of capitalism.
