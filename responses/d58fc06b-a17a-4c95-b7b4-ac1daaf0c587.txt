Okay, so I have this question about a Mother Goose nursery rhyme. I'm trying to remember which child is described as being full of woe. The options are A through J, each referring to a different child based on the day they were born or their position in the family.

I think the rhyme in question is "Monday's Child." Let me try to recall the verses. I remember that each day of the week corresponds to a different characteristic. For example, Monday's child is fair and clever, Tuesday's is full of woe. Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing it up with another rhyme. Or is it the other way around?

Wait, no, I think I'm confusing it with "The Days of the Week." Let me think again. The rhyme goes something like this:

Monday's child is fair of face,
Tuesday's child is full of woe,
Wednesday's child has far to go,
Thursday's child is full of cheer,
Friday's child is happy and free,
Saturday's child works for his living,
Sunday's child is a snuggle-wart.

Hmm, that seems familiar. So according to this, Tuesday's child is full of woe. So the answer would be B: Tuesday's child.

But wait, I'm not entirely sure. Let me double-check. The rhyme I'm thinking of does assign different traits to each day of the week. So Monday is fair, Tuesday is woe, Wednesday has far to go, Thursday is cheerful, Friday is happy, Saturday works hard, and Sunday is a snuggle-wart or maybe a lucky child. Yeah, I think I'm right. So the correct answer is B.

The correct answer is B: Tuesday's child.
