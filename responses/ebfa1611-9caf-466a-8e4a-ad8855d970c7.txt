Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question says: Two atoms of scandium are to combine with three atoms of oxygen. If we start with 1 gram of scandium, how much oxygen is required? The atomic weights are given: scandium is 44.96 g/mol, and oxygen is 15.999 g/mol. The options are A through J, and I need to pick the right one.

Alright, first, I think I need to figure out the chemical formula of the compound formed between scandium and oxygen. Scandium is Sc, and oxygen is O. The problem states that two Sc atoms combine with three O atoms. So the formula should be Sc2O3, right? Because for every two Sc atoms, there are three O atoms.

Now, I need to find out how much oxygen is needed when 1 gram of scandium is used. So I'll probably have to use stoichiometry, which involves moles, molar masses, and maybe Avogadro's number.

Let me start by finding out how many moles of scandium are in 1 gram. The atomic weight of Sc is 44.96 g/mol, which means one mole of Sc atoms weighs 44.96 grams. So, moles of Sc = mass / molar mass = 1 g / 44.96 g/mol. Let me calculate that.

1 divided by 44.96 is approximately 0.02225 moles of Sc. Wait, let me check that calculation. 44.96 goes into 1 about 0.0222 times because 44.96 * 0.0222 ≈ 1. So, moles of Sc ≈ 0.02225 mol.

Next, since the compound is Sc2O3, the mole ratio between Sc and O is 2:3. That means for every 2 moles of Sc, I need 3 moles of O. So, if I have 0.02225 moles of Sc, how much O is needed?

Let me set up a proportion. 2 moles Sc → 3 moles O. So, 0.02225 moles Sc → x moles O. Solving for x: x = (3/2) * 0.02225. Let's calculate that. 3/2 is 1.5, so 1.5 * 0.02225 = 0.033375 moles of O.

Wait, that seems right. So, I need 0.033375 moles of oxygen. Now, I need to convert that into grams. The molar mass of oxygen is 15.999 g/mol. So, grams of O = moles * molar mass = 0.033375 mol * 15.999 g/mol.

Let me compute that. 0.033375 multiplied by 16 is approximately 0.534 grams, but since 15.999 is slightly less than 16, it'll be a bit less. Let me do the exact calculation.

0.033375 * 15.999 ≈ Let's compute 0.033375 * 16 = 0.534. But since 15.999 is 0.001 less than 16, the actual product would be 0.534 minus (0.033375 * 0.001). That's 0.534 - 0.000033375 ≈ 0.5339666 grams. So approximately 0.534 grams of oxygen.

Wait, but looking at the options, let me see. Option J is 0.533 g, which is close. So that must be the answer. But let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

1. Calculated moles of Sc: 1g /44.96g/mol ≈ 0.02225 mol. Correct.
2. Mole ratio Sc:O is 2:3, so O needed is (3/2)*0.02225 ≈0.033375 mol. Correct.
3. Converted moles of O to grams: 0.033375 *15.999≈0.533g. Correct.

So, the answer should be J: 0.533 g of oxygen.

The problem involves determining the amount of oxygen required to combine with 1 gram of scandium to form Sc₂O₃. 

1. **Calculate moles of scandium**:  
   Moles of Sc = mass / molar mass = 1 g / 44.96 g/mol ≈ 0.02225 mol.

2. **Determine moles of oxygen needed**:  
   From the formula Sc₂O₃, the mole ratio is 2:3.  
   Moles of O = (3/2) × moles of Sc = (3/2) × 0.02225 ≈ 0.033375 mol.

3. **Convert moles of oxygen to grams**:  
   Mass of O = moles × molar mass = 0.033375 mol × 15.999 g/mol ≈ 0.533 g.

Thus, the required amount of oxygen is approximately **0.533 g**, corresponding to option J.
