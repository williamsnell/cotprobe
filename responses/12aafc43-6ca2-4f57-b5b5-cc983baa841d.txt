Question:

This question refers to the following information.
The following entries are in the diary of Napoleon Bonaparte.
Paris has a short memory. If I remain longer doing nothing, I am lost. In this great Babylon one reputation quickly succeeds another. After I have been seen three times at the theatre, I shall not be looked at again. I shall therefore not go very frequently. (diary, 1798)
If the press is not bridled, I shall not remain three days in power. (diary, 1799)
The presence of a general is necessary; he is the head, he is the all in all of an army. It was not the Roman army that conquered Gaul, it was Caesar, it was not the Carthaginians that made the armies of the Roman republic tremble at the very gates of Rome, it was Hannibal. (diary, 1801)
My power proceeds from my reputation, and my reputation from the victories I have won. My power would fall if I were not to support it with more glory and more victories. Conquest has made me what I am; only conquest can maintain me. (diary, 1802)
The revolution in France is over and now there is only one party in France and I shall never allow the newspapers to say anything contrary to my interests. They may publish a few little articles with just a bit of poison in them, but one fine day I shall shut their mouths forever. (diary, 1805)

Alright, so I've got this multiple-choice question about Napoleon Bonaparte, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let's break it down step by step.

First, I'll read the question carefully. It's asking about the domestic issue that Napoleon was most often criticized for, given that he's praised for implementing the Napoleonic Code and a meritocracy in the army. So, the question is about his domestic policies and which one was a point of criticism.

Looking at the options:

A: High taxes
B: Curtailment of citizens' rights
C: Abolishing the French monarchy
D: Favoritism in army promotions
E: Placing relatives on foreign thrones
F: Neglecting agriculture
G: Compulsory military service
H: Changing criminal code
I: Ignoring working class
J: Financial mismanagement

I remember that Napoleon is known for several things. The Napoleonic Code was a significant legal reform, promoting merit and equality, so that's a positive. But in terms of criticism, I think he's often criticized for issues like centralizing power, restricting political freedoms, and maybe his treatment of the military or his personal ambitions.

Looking at the options again, let's consider each one:

A: High taxes. I know that under Napoleon, taxes were increased, but was that a major criticism? Maybe, but I'm not sure if that's the top issue.

B: Curtailment of citizens' rights. This seems possible. Napoleon did consolidate power, which might have led to less freedom for citizens. He had a police state and controlled the press, which could be a sign of curtailing rights.

C: Abolishing the monarchy. Wait, he actually restored the monarchy in a way with the Bourbon restoration, but he also had his own rule. I'm not sure if this was a criticism point.

D: Favoritism in army promotions. The meritocracy was one of his positives, but did he practice favoritism? I think he tried to base promotions on merit, but he did have a system where he could appoint people, so maybe there was some favoritism.

E: Placing relatives on foreign thrones. This is something he did, like with his brothers and sisters. It's more of an international policy issue, but not sure if it's a domestic criticism.

F: Neglecting agriculture. I don't recall this being a major issue, but maybe the economy was affected by his wars.

G: Compulsory military service. He did expand the army, but I'm not sure if this was a domestic criticism point. It's more about conscription, which he implemented, but it's part of his military reforms.

H: Changing criminal code. The Napoleonic Code did change laws, but I don't think that's the main criticism point.

I: Ignoring the working class. He did some reforms, but the working class might have been neglected, leading to issues like poor working conditions and low wages. This could be a point of criticism.

J: Financial mismanagement. He had a lot of wars, which might have led to financial strain, but was that a main domestic issue?

Now, considering the context of the question, which refers to his diary entries. Looking at the entries, one mentions the press and controlling it (diary 1799), another talks about the importance of a general and military strength (1801), and others about reputation and power. So, he was very concerned about maintaining control and his image, which might tie into curtailing rights or controlling the press.

In terms of domestic policies, I think the main criticisms were more about his consolidation of power, the centralization of government, and the reduction of political freedoms. So option B: Curtailment of citizens' rights seems plausible.

Another point is that while he introduced the Napoleonic Code, which was progressive in some ways, his rule was also marked by authoritarianism. He restricted freedom of the press, limited political opposition, and had a strong central government, which would curtail citizens' rights.

So, putting it all together, the domestic issue he was most criticized for is likely the curtailing of citizens' rights.
