Okay, so I have this problem about choosing the right diameter for a shaft in a car based on the power transmitted and the shear stress. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my mechanical engineering, but let me try to think through this step by step.

First, the problem says that the engine develops 120 horsepower (hp) at 300 revolutions per minute (rpm). This power is to be transmitted through a shaft, and the shear stress on the shaft is given as 6500 psi. I need to find the suitable standard diameter from the options provided.

I remember that power transmitted through a shaft relates to shear stress and torsion. The formula for power in terms of shear stress is something like P = (π * D^3 * τ * N) / 16, where P is power, D is the diameter, τ is shear stress, and N is the speed in rpm. Or wait, maybe it's P = (τ * D^3 * N) / 2. Let me make sure I get the formula right.

Oh right, the correct formula for power transmitted in a shaft is P = (τ * D^3 * N) / 2, where P is in horsepower, τ is shear stress in psi, D is diameter in inches, and N is rpm. Wait, no, I think I might be mixing up units here. Because in the formula, when using horsepower, the formula is P (hp) = (τ (psi) * D^3 (in^3) * N (rpm)) / (some constant). Let me check the exact formula.

Wait, I think the formula is P = (τ * D^4 * N) / (some constant), but that doesn't sound right. Alternatively, I've heard that the power can be expressed using the torsional shear stress formula. The torsional shear stress τ is given by τ = (T * D) / (2 * J), where T is torque, and J is the polar moment of inertia. But maybe it's easier to use the power formula directly.

Alternatively, I remember that the power transmitted by a shaft can be calculated as P = (T * ω) / 7457, where T is torque in lb-ft, and ω is angular velocity in rad/s. Since power is in horsepower, and 1 hp is approximately 7457 watts or 7457 ft-lb/s.

So, first, I can find the torque T from the power and speed. Power P is 120 hp, and speed N is 300 rpm. Let me convert rpm to rad/s because ω is in radians per second.

ω = 300 rpm * (2π rad/rev) / 60 s/min = 10π rad/s ≈ 31.4159 rad/s.

Now, using P = T * ω / 7457, I can solve for T.

Rearranging, T = (P * 7457) / ω.

Plugging in the numbers: T = (120 * 7457) / 31.4159.

Let me calculate that:

120 * 7457 = 894,840.

Divide by 31.4159: 894,840 / 31.4159 ≈ 28,473 lb-ft.

Wait, that seems really high. Let me check the calculation again.

Wait, 7457 is the conversion factor from hp to ft-lbf/s. So, P in hp multiplied by 7457 gives the power in ft-lbf/s. So yes, 120 * 7457 = 894,840 ft-lbf/s.

Then, ω is 300 rpm, which is 300 * (2π)/60 = 10π rad/s ≈ 31.4159 rad/s.

So T = (894,840) / 31.4159 ≈ 28,473 lb-ft. Hmm, that's a huge torque. I must have made a mistake because that seems way too high. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula in horsepower directly. The formula for torque in lb-ft when you have horsepower and rpm is T = (P * 5252) / N.

Wait, yes, that's another formula I remember: T (lb-ft) = (P (hp) * 5252) / N (rpm).

So, let me try that. 5252 is the conversion factor because 1 hp = 5252 ft-lbf per minute. So, T = (120 * 5252) / 300.

Calculating that: 120 * 5252 = 630,240. Divided by 300, that's 2100.8 lb-ft. That's more reasonable. So torque T is approximately 2100.8 lb-ft.

Wait, that's 2100 lb-ft, which is still a lot, but maybe it's correct for a vehicle's rear axle. Let me proceed with that.

Now, the shear stress τ is given as 6500 psi. The formula that relates shear stress, torque, and diameter is τ = (T * D) / (2 * J), where J is the polar moment of inertia of the shaft. But J for a solid shaft is (π * D^4) / 32. So substituting J into the shear stress formula:

τ = (T * D) / (2 * (π * D^4 / 32)) )

Simplifying that: τ = (T * D) * 32 / (2 * π * D^4) ) = (16 * T) / (π * D^3)

So, rearranged to solve for D: D^3 = (16 * T) / (π * τ)

Plugging in the numbers: T is 2100.8 lb-ft, τ is 6500 psi.

Wait, but let me make sure the units are consistent. Torque T here is in lb-ft, and shear stress τ is in psi (lb/in²). So, I need to make sure the units are compatible.

Let me write the formula again: D^3 = (16 * T) / (π * τ)

But since T is in lb-ft and τ is in lb/in², I need to convert T to lb-in instead of lb-ft. Because 1 ft = 12 inches, so T in lb-in would be 2100.8 lb-ft * 12 in/ft = 25,209.6 lb-in.

So, T = 25,209.6 lb-in.

Now, plug into D^3 = (16 * 25,209.6) / (π * 6500)

Calculate numerator: 16 * 25,209.6 = 403,353.6

Denominator: π * 6500 ≈ 3.1416 * 6500 ≈ 20,420.4

So D^3 = 403,353.6 / 20,420.4 ≈ 19.75

Now, taking the cube root of 19.75. Let's see:

Cube of 2.7 is 2.7^3 = 19.683, which is very close to 19.75. So D ≈ 2.7 inches.

Looking at the options, option A is 2.7 inches, and option I is 2.5 inches. So the closest is 2.7 inches.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

First, T in lb-in: 2100.8 lb-ft * 12 = 25,209.6 lb-in. Correct.

Shear stress τ is 6500 psi.

So D^3 = (16 * 25,209.6) / (π * 6500) = (403,353.6) / (20,420.4) ≈ 19.75.

Cube root of 19.75: 2.7^3 is 19.683, so yes, D≈2.7 inches.

So the suitable diameter is 2.7 inches, which is option A.

To determine the suitable diameter for the shaft, the following steps were taken:

1. **Convert Power to Torque**:  
   Using the formula \( T = \frac{P \cdot 5252}{N} \), where \( P = 120 \, \text{hp} \) and \( N = 300 \, \text{rpm} \), the torque \( T \) was calculated as approximately \( 2100.8 \, \text{lb-ft} \). Converting this to \( \text{lb-in} \) gives \( 25,209.6 \, \text{lb-in} \).

2. **Relate Shear Stress to Diameter**:  
   The formula \( \tau = \frac{16T}{\pi D^3} \) was used, where \( \tau = 6500 \, \text{psi} \). Rearranging for \( D^3 \), the equation becomes \( D^3 = \frac{16T}{\pi \tau} \).

3. **Calculate Diameter**:  
   Substituting \( T = 25,209.6 \, \text{lb-in} \) and \( \tau = 6500 \, \text{psi} \), \( D^3 \) was found to be approximately \( 19.75 \). Taking the cube root gives \( D \approx 2.7 \, \text{in} \).

4. **Select the Closest Option**:  
   Among the provided options, \( 2.7 \, \text{in} \) corresponds to option A.
