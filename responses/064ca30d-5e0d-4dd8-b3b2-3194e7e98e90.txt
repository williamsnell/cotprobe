Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this evidence question about whether a statement is admissible. Let me break it down step by step.

The scenario is a defendant on trial for attempted murder. The victim testifies and describes how the defendant beat her with a baseball bat. Then, the prosecution calls another witness who wants to testify that after the beating stopped, the victim screamed, "I'm dying. Don't let the defendant get away with this."

The issue here is whether this statement is admissible. The defendant's attorney objected, so we need to determine if the statement is admissible under hearsay exceptions or not.

First, I remember that hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. So, the victim's statement here is being offered to prove that she was dying, which relates to the defendant's actions. So it's hearsay unless an exception applies.

Looking at the options, the possible exceptions include present sense impressions, excited utterances, statements against interest, etc.

Option E says admissible as a present sense impression. Present sense impressions are statements describing an event made while the event is occurring or immediately thereafter. The statement here was after the beating stopped, so it's not during the event but right after. I think present sense impressions require the statement to be made contemporaneously with the event. So maybe E is not correct.

Option G is excited utterance. Excited utterances are statements made under the stress of a startling event, before the declarant has had time to fabricate. The beating was a startling event, so the scream right after might qualify. The witness is testifying about what the victim said, so it's being offered as an excited utterance. I think this could be admissible because the statement was made under stress.

Option A is a statement of then existing condition. That's for statements like "I'm hurt" made at the time, but here the statement includes a future consequence ("I'm dying") and a request, which might be more opinion or a statement against interest.

Option H says inadmissible as hearsay not within any exception. But I think G might apply, so H might not be correct.

Option I is statement against interest. That applies when the statement is against the declarant's pecuniary or proprietary interest. Here, the victim's statement might not be against her interest; in fact, it's more of a cry for help. So I don't think I applies.

Option D says inadmissible because the victim wasn't questioned about the statement before being excused. Wait, the rule about prior statements is that if a witness is asked about prior inconsistent statements, they can be admitted, but here the prosecution didn't ask about the statement. However, the hearsay exception for excited utterance doesn't require prior questioning. So D might not be the right reason to exclude it.

Option F says inadmissible because the witness wasn't present. But the witness was present when the statement was made, so F is incorrect.

So, the key here is whether the statement qualifies as an excited utterance. Since the beating was a traumatic event, the scream right after would likely be considered an excited utterance under FRE 803(2). Therefore, the statement is admissible as an excited utterance, which would make option G correct.

Wait, but let me double-check. The statement was "I'm dying. Don't let the defendant get away with this." The first part is a statement of physical condition, which could be a present sense impression. The second part is more of a request or a statement against the defendant. But under excited utterance, both parts could be admitted if made under stress.

Yes, so the statement is admissible under the excited utterance exception. So the correct answer should be G.

The statement made by the victim after the beating stopped qualifies as an excited utterance under the Federal Rules of Evidence 803(2). This exception applies to statements made under the stress of a startling event, which in this case was the violent attack. The victim's statement, "I'm dying. Don't let the defendant get away with this," was made immediately after the traumatic event, making it admissible as an excited utterance.
