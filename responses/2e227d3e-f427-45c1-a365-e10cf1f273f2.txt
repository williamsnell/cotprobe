Question:

Which of the following is not correct about economies of scale?

Options:

A: Economies of scale are associated with increases in production of output.
B: Economies of scale are associated with the rising or increasing portion of an average total cost (ATC) curve.
C: Economies of scale are associated with the declining or decreasing portions of the ATC curve.
D: Economies of scale result in decreases in per unit average cost.

Okay, I need to figure out which statement about economies of scale is incorrect. Let me start by recalling what economies of scale mean. So, economies of scale refer to the cost advantages that businesses obtain due to their scale of operation, with cost per unit of output decreasing as the volume of production increases. 

Looking at the options:

Option A says economies of scale are associated with increases in production. That makes sense because as production increases, the average cost per unit tends to decrease, which is the essence of economies of scale. So A seems correct.

Option B claims they're associated with the rising or increasing portion of the ATC curve. Wait, the ATC curve typically has two parts. Initially, as production increases, ATC decreases—that's the economies of scale. But after a certain point, the curve might start rising due to diminishing returns or other factors like coordination costs. So the increasing portion would be a lack of economies of scale or even diseconomies of scale, not economies of scale. So B might be incorrect.

Option C states economies of scale are associated with the declining portion of ATC. That aligns with what I remember—when ATC is decreasing, that's where economies of scale happen. So C is correct.

Option D says economies of scale result in decreases in per unit average cost. Exactly, that's the definition. So D is correct.

So the incorrect statement is B because economies of scale are about the decreasing part, not the increasing part of the ATC curve.

The incorrect statement about economies of scale is option B, as economies of scale are associated with the declining portion of the ATC curve, not the rising portion.

Answer: B
