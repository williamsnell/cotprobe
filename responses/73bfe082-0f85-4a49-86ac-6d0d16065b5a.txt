Okay, so I've got this question about banking and the money supply, and I need to figure out the immediate effect when Bank A receives a deposit and then grants a loan. Hmm, let's break it down step by step.

First, I remember that when a bank receives a deposit, it doesn't just keep all that money idle. Banks are required to keep a certain portion as reserves, but the rest can be lent out. This is part of the fractional reserve banking system. So, when Mr. X deposits $1000 in currency into Bank A, that money becomes part of the bank's assets. But wait, the question is about the money supply. So, does this deposit increase the money supply right away?

I think the money supply includes both the physical currency and the demand deposits (like checking accounts). When Mr. X deposits $1000, that's moving money from his physical holdings into the bank. So, the total money in circulation might decrease by $1000 because now it's sitting in the bank as a deposit. But wait, the bank doesn't keep all of it. They have to hold some as reserves, say 10% if the reserve ratio is 10%, which would be $100 in this case. The remaining $900 would be available to lend out.

Then, Bank A grants a loan of $500 to Mr. Y. When Mr. Y takes that loan, he's going to spend it, right? So, he'll withdraw the $500 from his new account. That means the bank's reserves decrease by $500, but now Mr. Y has $500 in his account, which is part of the money supply as a demand deposit.

Wait, but the initial deposit was $1000. The bank can lend out up to $900 (if the reserve ratio is 10%), but in this case, they only lent $500. So, after the deposit and the loan, how does the money supply change?

Let me think again. The money supply is M1, which includes coins, bills, and demand deposits. When Mr. X deposits $1000 in cash into the bank, that reduces the currency in circulation by $1000. But the bank then creates a demand deposit of $1000 for Mr. X. So, the money supply remains the same because the cash is just moved from one part (physical) to another (demand deposit). But then, when the bank lends $500 to Mr. Y, they create a new demand deposit of $500. So, the money supply increases by $500 because Mr. Y now has $500 in his account that he can spend, which wasn't there before.

Wait, but the initial deposit didn't change the money supply because it's just moving from cash to a deposit. The loan adds $500 to the deposit side, so the money supply increases by $500. But I'm a bit confused because sometimes I've heard that the money supply can increase through the lending process, but in the immediate case, only the loan affects it.

Alternatively, maybe the immediate effect is that the money supply doesn't change because the $1000 was just moved from cash to a deposit, and then the $500 loan adds to the deposits. So the net change is +$500.

But wait, the question is about the immediate effect. So when the bank receives the $1000 deposit, the money supply doesn't change because it's just a transfer. Then, when they lend $500, that adds $500 to the money supply because now there's an additional $500 in the system through the loan.

Alternatively, maybe the immediate effect is that the money supply increases by $500 because the bank's action of granting the loan creates new money in the form of a demand deposit. So the correct answer would be B: add $500 to the money supply.

Wait, but another thought: the initial deposit of $1000 in cash into the bank removes $1000 from the money supply (since it's no longer in circulation), but the bank's assets increase by $1000. Then, when they lend $500, they create a $500 demand deposit, so the money supply goes up by $500. But because the initial $1000 was taken out of circulation, the net change is -$1000 + $500 = -$500, but that doesn't make sense because the options don't have a negative change.

Wait, no. The money supply includes both cash and demand deposits. So when Mr. X deposits $1000 in cash, the money supply doesn't change because the $1000 is now in a demand deposit. Then, when the bank lends $500, they create a new demand deposit of $500, so the money supply increases by $500. Therefore, the immediate effect is an increase of $500.

But wait, I'm a bit confused because I might be mixing up the concepts of the money multiplier effect, which happens over time as banks lend and create more deposits. But the question is about the immediate effect. So, the initial deposit doesn't change the money supply because it's just moving from cash to a deposit. Then, the loan adds $500, so the money supply increases by $500. So the answer should be B: add $500.

But another angle: when the bank receives the $1000, they have more reserves. Then, when they lend $500, they create a new deposit of $500, which increases the money supply by $500. So yes, the answer is B.

The immediate effect on the money supply occurs when Bank A grants a loan of $500 to Mr. Y. When Mr. X deposits $1000 in currency, the money supply remains unchanged because the $1000 moves from physical cash to a demand deposit. However, when the bank lends $500 to Mr. Y, it creates a new demand deposit, increasing the money supply by $500.
