Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question says that when a current of 5.36 A is passed for 30 minutes through an electrolytic cell containing a solution of a zinc salt, 3.27 grams of zinc metal is deposited at the cathode. The task is to find the equivalent weight of zinc in the salt, and there are multiple-choice options provided.

Hmm, I remember that in electrolysis, the amount of substance deposited is related to the current, time, and the equivalent weight. The formula I think I should use comes from Faraday's laws of electrolysis. The basic idea is that the mass of a substance deposited is proportional to the amount of charge passed through the solution.

Faraday's first law states that the amount of substance deposited is equal to (current × time) divided by the equivalent weight. The formula is:

Mass (m) = (I × t) / (E × 96485)

Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again. Oh right, the formula is:

m = (I × t) / (E × 1000) × M

Wait, no, perhaps more accurately, the formula is m = (I × t) / (n × F) × M, where n is the valence and F is Faraday's constant. Or maybe I should start from the basics.

Let me reorganize. The mass deposited can be calculated using the formula:

m = (I × t) × (Molar Mass) / (n × F)

Wait, no, I think it's better to approach it using equivalents. The equivalent weight (E) is the molar mass divided by the valence (n). So, E = M / n.

Faraday's law says that the amount of substance deposited is equal to the amount of charge passed divided by the equivalent weight. The charge Q is current I multiplied by time t (in seconds). So, Q = I × t.

The formula for mass deposited is:

m = (Q) / (E × 96485)

Wait, no, I think I might be mixing up the units. Let me get this straight.

Faraday's constant F is 96485 C/mol. So, the charge Q is I (in A) multiplied by t (in seconds). So, Q = I * t.

Each mole of electrons corresponds to F coulombs. The number of moles of electrons (n_e) is Q / F.

In an electrolytic cell, the metal is deposited at the cathode. For zinc, which has a valence of +2, each mole of Zn^2+ requires 2 moles of electrons to be reduced to Zn metal. So, the moles of Zn deposited (n_Zn) is n_e / 2.

So, n_Zn = (I * t) / (2 * F)

The mass of Zn deposited is n_Zn multiplied by the molar mass of Zn (M).

So, m = (I * t) / (2 * F) * M

We can rearrange this to solve for M, the molar mass of Zn. But wait, the question is about the equivalent weight of Zn in the salt. Since equivalent weight E is M / n, and for zinc, n is 2 (because Zn^2+), E = M / 2.

So, let's plug in the numbers.

Given:
I = 5.36 A
t = 30 minutes = 30 * 60 = 1800 seconds
m = 3.27 g

We need to find E, the equivalent weight.

First, calculate the charge Q:
Q = I * t = 5.36 A * 1800 s = 5.36 * 1800 = let's compute that.

5 * 1800 = 9000, 0.36 * 1800 = 648, so total is 9000 + 648 = 9648 C.

Wait, that's interesting. 5.36 * 1800 is 5.36 * 1.8e3 = let's calculate accurately.

5.36 * 1800 = 5.36 * 18 * 100. 5 * 18 =90, 0.36*18=6.48 → total 96.48. So 96.48 * 100 = 9648 C.

So Q = 9648 C.

Now, the moles of electrons (n_e) is Q / F = 9648 C / 96485 C/mol ≈ 0.1 mol.

Wait, 9648 divided by 96485 is approximately 0.1, exactly 0.1 (since 96485 is 10 times 9648.5). So yes, n_e ≈ 0.1 mol.

Now, since each mole of Zn requires 2 moles of electrons, the moles of Zn deposited is n_Zn = n_e / 2 = 0.1 / 2 = 0.05 mol.

The mass of Zn deposited is m = n_Zn * M, where M is the molar mass of Zn.

Given m = 3.27 g,

3.27 g = 0.05 mol * M → M = 3.27 / 0.05 = 65.4 g/mol.

Wait, that's the molar mass of zinc. Zinc's atomic weight is about 65.38 g/mol, so that's correct.

But the question is asking for the equivalent weight of zinc in the salt. The equivalent weight E is M / n, where n is the valency. Since zinc is Zn^2+ in the salt, n=2.

So E = 65.4 / 2 = 32.7 g/equivalent.

Looking at the options, option F is 32.7g. So the answer should be F.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Current is 5.36 A for 30 minutes (1800 s). Charge Q = 5.36 * 1800 = 9648 C.

n_e = 9648 / 96485 ≈ 0.1 mol.

n_Zn = 0.1 / 2 = 0.05 mol.

Mass m = 0.05 * M = 3.27 → M = 65.4 g/mol.

E = 65.4 / 2 = 32.7 g/equivalent.

Yes, that seems correct. So the answer is F: 32.7g.

The problem involves using Faraday's laws of electrolysis to determine the equivalent weight of zinc. The mass of zinc deposited is related to the current, time, and equivalent weight via the formula:

\[
m = \frac{I \cdot t}{E \cdot F}
\]

Where:
- \( m \) is the mass of zinc deposited (3.27 g),
- \( I \) is the current (5.36 A),
- \( t \) is the time in seconds (1800 s),
- \( E \) is the equivalent weight of zinc,
- \( F \) is Faraday's constant (96485 C/mol).

Rearranging the formula to solve for \( E \):

\[
E = \frac{I \cdot t \cdot E}{m \cdot F}
\]

First, calculate the charge \( Q \):

\[
Q = I \cdot t = 5.36 \, \text{A} \times 1800 \, \text{s} = 9648 \, \text{C}
\]

Next, determine the moles of electrons (\( n_e \)):

\[
n_e = \frac{Q}{F} = \frac{9648 \, \text{C}}{96485 \, \text{C/mol}} \approx 0.1 \, \text{mol}
\]

Since zinc has a valency of 2, the moles of zinc deposited (\( n_{\text{Zn}} \)) are:

\[
n_{\text{Zn}} = \frac{n_e}{2} = \frac{0.1}{2} = 0.05 \, \text{mol}
\]

Using the molar mass (\( M \)) of zinc:

\[
M = \frac{m}{n_{\text{Zn}}} = \frac{3.27 \, \text{g}}{0.05 \, \text{mol}} = 65.4 \, \text{g/mol}
\]

The equivalent weight (\( E \)) is:

\[
E = \frac{M}{\text{valency}} = \frac{65.4}{2} = 32.7 \, \text{g/equivalent}
\]

Thus, the equivalent weight of zinc is **32.7 g**, corresponding to option F.
