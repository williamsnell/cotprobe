Question:

How does the price mechanism act to conservethose productsand resources which are most scarce?

Options:

A: The price mechanism guarantees an equal distribution of scarce resources among consumers.
B: The price mechanism ensures that scarce resources are only used by the government.
C: The price mechanism has no effect on the conservation of scarce resources.
D: The price mechanism leads to a rapid depletion of scarce resources due to increased demand.
E: The price mechanism caps the price of scarce resources to make them affordable.
F: The price mechanism reduces the production of scarce resources.
G: The price mechanism discourages consumers from buying scarce resources.
H: The price mechanism allocates scarce resources to the highest bidders, regardless of the conservation status.
I: The price mechanism induces consumers to search for substitutes, an act which will tend to conserve the scarce resource.
J: The price mechanism encourages overuse of scarce resources.

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about how the price mechanism conserves scarce products and resources. I'm a bit rusty on economics, but let me think it through.

The question is asking how the price mechanism acts to conserve scarce resources. The options are A through J, and I need to pick the correct one.

First, I remember that the price mechanism is part of the market system. Prices are determined by supply and demand. When something is scarce, its supply is low relative to demand. So, how does price affect this?

If a product is scarce, the supply decreases. According to the laws of supply and demand, if supply decreases and demand remains the same, the price should increase. Higher prices act as an incentive for producers to supply more, but since the resource is scarce, maybe they can't produce more quickly.

But how does this conserve resources? Well, higher prices might deter some consumers from buying the product because it's more expensive. So, people might look for substitutes instead. That makes sense because if a product becomes too expensive, consumers might find alternatives, reducing the pressure on the scarce resource.

Looking at the options:

A: Equal distribution. No, prices don't ensure equal distribution; they reflect value and availability.

B: Only government uses. That sounds more like a command economy, not the free market.

C: No effect. Not true, prices definitely influence behavior.

D: Rapid depletion. Higher prices usually reduce demand, so this might not be right.

E: Caps prices. Price capping is a policy, but the question is about the natural mechanism.

F: Reduces production. If prices are high, producers might produce more, not less.

G: Discourages buying. Higher prices can discourage, but it's more about substitution.

H: Allocates to highest bidders. That's part of it, but how does that conserve? It just allocates, not necessarily conserve.

I: Encourages search for substitutes. Yes, higher prices make substitutes more attractive, reducing the use of the scarce resource.

J: Encourages overuse. No, higher prices would make people use less, not more.

So the correct answer should be I. The price mechanism induces consumers to search for substitutes, which conserves the scarce resource.

The price mechanism conserves scarce resources by influencing consumer behavior. When a product is scarce, its price rises, making it less affordable and encouraging consumers to seek alternatives. This reduces demand on the scarce resource, promoting conservation.

Answer: I
