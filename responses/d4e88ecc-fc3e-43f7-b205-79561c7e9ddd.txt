Okay, so I need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 24 and 36. Hmm, I remember that LCM is the smallest number that both numbers divide into without leaving a remainder. I think there are a couple of methods to find the LCM, like listing multiples or using prime factors. Let me try both to make sure I get it right.

First, maybe I'll list the multiples of each number and see where they overlap. The multiples of 24 are 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144, and so on. For 36, the multiples are 36, 72, 108, 144, etc. Wait, I see 72 in both lists. So 72 is a common multiple. But is it the smallest? Let me check. Before 72, the multiples are 24, 36, but 36 doesn't divide 24, and 24 doesn't divide 36. So yeah, 72 seems to be the first common multiple. So the LCM should be 72. Looking at the options, option C is 72.

Alternatively, using prime factors might be more efficient. Let me factor both numbers. 24 breaks down into 2^3 * 3^1, because 2*2*2*3=24. And 36 is 2^2 * 3^2. To find the LCM, I take the highest power of each prime number present. So for 2, the highest power is 2^3 from 24, and for 3, it's 3^2 from 36. Multiplying these together gives 8 * 9 = 72. Yep, same result.

I think that's solid. So the answer should be C: 72.

The least common multiple (LCM) of 24 and 36 is 72, found using both listing multiples and prime factorization methods.
