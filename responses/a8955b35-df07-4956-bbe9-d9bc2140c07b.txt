Okay, so I need to find the inverse Laplace transform of F(s) where F(s) is (2s + 4)/(s² + 2s +5). Hmm, I remember that Laplace transforms often involve breaking down the expression into simpler parts that match known transform pairs. 

First, I should probably complete the square in the denominator to make it easier. The denominator is s² + 2s +5. Completing the square, I take s² +2s, add (2/2)²=1, so it becomes (s+1)² + (5-1)=4. So the denominator is (s+1)² + 4. That looks like the standard form for a damped sinusoid, which is (s + a)² + ω², whose inverse Laplace is e^(-at) cos(ωt) and similar sine terms.

Now, the numerator is 2s +4. Let me factor out a 2 to get 2(s +2). Wait, but the denominator is (s+1)^2 +4. Hmm, maybe I can express the numerator in terms that relate to the denominator's derivative or something. Alternatively, I can use partial fractions or split the numerator into terms that match the denominator and its derivative.

Let me think. The Laplace transform of e^(-at) cos(ωt) is (s + a)/[(s +a)^2 + ω²], and the sine term is ω/[(s+a)^2 + ω²]. So perhaps I can express F(s) as a combination of these two forms.

Let me write F(s) = (2s +4)/[(s+1)^2 +4]. Let me split this into two parts: (2s + 2 + 2)/[(s+1)^2 +4]. Wait, maybe I should separate it differently. Alternatively, I can split the numerator into terms that fit the standard forms. Let me try to write F(s) as A*(s +1) + B* something over the denominator.

So, let me set F(s) = [A(s +1) + B]/[(s+1)^2 +4] + C/(denominator). Wait, perhaps a better approach is to express it as a combination of (s +1) and a constant over the denominator.

So, let me let F(s) = A*(s+1)/[(s+1)^2 +4] + B*1/[(s+1)^2 +4]. Then, the numerator would be A(s+1) + B = 2s +4.

Expanding A(s+1) + B = As + A + B. Comparing to 2s +4, we have:

As = 2s → A = 2.

And A + B =4 → since A=2, B=2.

So F(s) = 2*(s+1)/[(s+1)^2 +4] + 2*1/[(s+1)^2 +4].

Now, the inverse Laplace of (s +1)/[(s+1)^2 +4] is e^(-t) cos(2t), because the standard form is (s +a)/[(s +a)^2 + ω²] → e^(-at) cos(ωt), so here a=1, ω=2.

The inverse Laplace of 1/[(s+1)^2 +4] is e^(-t) sin(2t)/2, because it's ω/((s+a)^2 + ω²) → (1/ω) e^(-at) sin(ωt). Wait, no, wait, the transform of sin(ωt) is ω/((s +a)^2 + ω²), so the inverse would be sin(ωt), but scaled by 1/ω. So 1/((s+1)^2 +4) would be (1/2) e^(-t) sin(2t).

Wait, let me check:

L{ e^{at} cos(ωt) } = (s - a)/[(s -a)^2 + ω²]
L{ e^{at} sin(ωt) } = ω/[(s -a)^2 + ω²]

So, if we have 1/[(s + a)^2 + ω²], that's the same as 1/(s'^2 + ω²) where s' = s +a, which corresponds to e^{-at} sin(ωt)/ω.

Wait, no, because L{ sin(ωt) } = ω/(s² + ω²). So L^{-1} { 1/(s² + ω²) } is sin(ωt)/ω. So in this case, since we have (s+1)^2 +4, which is s'² + (2)^2, a=1, ω=2. So 1/[(s+1)^2 +4] → (1/2) e^{-t} sin(2t).

So back to F(s):

F(s) = 2*(s+1)/denominator + 2*(1)/denominator.

So inverse Laplace:

f(t) = 2*e^{-t} cos(2t) + 2*(1/2) e^{-t} sin(2t).

Simplify: 2 e^{-t} cos(2t) + e^{-t} sin(2t).

Wait, but looking at the options, option I is f(t) = 2e^{-t} cos2t + e^{-t} sin2t. So that's option I.

Wait, but let me double-check the coefficients. From F(s) = 2*(s+1)/denominator + 2/denominator.

The first term gives 2 e^{-t} cos(2t), the second term is 2 * [1/(denominator)] → 2*(1/2) e^{-t} sin(2t) because 1/denominator is (1/2) e^{-t} sin(2t). So 2*(1/2) is 1. So overall, f(t) = 2 e^{-t} cos2t + e^{-t} sin2t.

Looking at the options:

Option I is exactly that: 2e^-t cos2t + e^-t sin2t.

Wait, but another approach: sometimes the method of partial fractions or using a table entry might involve a different way.

Alternatively, I could have used the formula for the inverse Laplace of (as + b)/(s² + 2s +5). Let me see if that approach confirms the same result.

The denominator is s² +2s +5 = (s+1)^2 +4, so a=1, ω=2.

The general form for inverse Laplace when F(s) = (α s + β)/[(s + a)^2 + ω²]. The inverse would be e^{-at} [α cos(ωt) + (β/ω) sin(ωt)].

In this case, F(s) is (2s +4)/denominator. So α=2, β=4, a=1, ω=2.

So f(t) = e^{-t} [2 cos(2t) + (4/2) sin(2t)] = e^{-t} [2 cos(2t) + 2 sin(2t)].

Wait, that gives 2 cos(2t) + 2 sin(2t), but that's different from what I had earlier. Wait, did I make a mistake in the earlier step?

Wait, wait, perhaps I messed up the coefficients. Let me redo it.

Using the general formula: If F(s) = (α s + β)/[(s +a)^2 + ω²], then the inverse Laplace is e^{-at} [ α cos(ωt) + (β/ω) sin(ωt) ].

In our case, F(s) = (2s +4)/[(s+1)^2 +4], so α=2, β=4, a=1, ω=2.

So f(t) = e^{-t} [2 cos(2t) + (4/2) sin(2t)] = e^{-t} [2 cos(2t) + 2 sin(2t)].

Wait, but earlier when I split F(s) into two terms, I ended up with 2 cos(2t) + e^{-t} sin(2t). So which is correct?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the first approach. Let me check.

In the first approach, I split F(s) into 2*(s+1)/(denominator) + 2/(denominator). So the inverse Laplace is 2 e^{-t} cos2t + 2*(1/2) e^{-t} sin2t. Because the inverse of 1/denominator is (1/2) e^{-t} sin2t. So 2*(1/2) is 1. So that gives 2 cos +1 sin.

But according to the general formula, it's 2 cos + 2 sin. So that's a discrepancy. Which one is correct?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the general formula. Let me re-examine the general formula.

The Laplace transform of e^{-at} [A cos(ωt) + B sin(ωt)] is (A(s +a) + B ω)/[(s +a)^2 + ω²].

So if F(s) = (α s + β)/[(s +a)^2 + ω²], then we can match terms:

α s + β = A(s +a) + B ω.

Which gives:

α = A,

β = A a + B ω.

So solving for A and B:

From α = A → A = α.

Then β = α a + B ω → B = (β - α a)/ω.

So in our problem, α=2, β=4, a=1, ω=2.

So A=2,

B=(4 - 2*1)/2 = (4-2)/2=2/2=1.

So the inverse Laplace is e^{-t} [2 cos(2t) + 1 sin(2t)].

Which matches the first approach: 2 cos + 1 sin. So the correct answer is 2 e^{-t} cos2t + e^{-t} sin2t, which is option I.

Wait, but earlier when I used the general formula, I thought it would give 2 cos + 2 sin, but that was a mistake because I misapplied the formula.

So the correct coefficients are 2 and 1, making option I the correct choice.

The inverse Laplace transform of \( F(s) = \frac{2s + 4}{s^2 + 2s + 5} \) is found by expressing it in terms of known Laplace transform pairs. Completing the square in the denominator gives \( (s + 1)^2 + 4 \), and splitting the numerator into suitable terms leads to the result \( f(t) = 2e^{-t}\cos(2t) + e^{-t}\sin(2t) \), which matches option I.
