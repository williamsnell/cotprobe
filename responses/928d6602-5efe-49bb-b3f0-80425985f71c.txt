Okay, so I need to figure out how much Bob has to pay each creditor in cents on the dollar, and then determine how much a creditor with a $4,500 claim would receive. Let's break this down step by step.

First, the problem states that Bob has debts totaling $25,000, but when he went bankrupt, he only had $15,000 available to pay his creditors. So, the total amount he can pay back is $15,000 across all his debts. 

I think the first thing to do is find out what percentage of each debt Bob can pay. Since he has $15k to pay off $25k, I should calculate the ratio of available funds to total debt. 

So, $15,000 divided by $25,000 equals 0.6. To convert that to cents on the dollar, I multiply by 100, which gives 60 cents. So, Bob can pay 60 cents on each dollar he owes.

Now, the next part is figuring out how much a specific creditor gets. The creditor in question has a claim of $4,500. If Bob is paying 60 cents on the dollar, then the amount paid would be 60% of $4,500. 

Calculating 60% of $4,500: 0.6 * 4,500 = $2,700. 

Looking at the options, option H says 60 cents on the dollar and $2,700. That matches what I calculated. Let me just double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 

Wait, another way to think about it is: if the total available is $15,000 and the total debt is $25,000, then each creditor gets their claim multiplied by (15,000/25,000). So for this creditor, 4,500 * (15/25) = 4,500 * 0.6 = 2,700. Yep, that's correct.

So the correct answer should be H: 60 cents on the dollar, $2,700.

Bob has $15,000 to pay $25,000 in debts, which is a ratio of 60% (60 cents on the dollar). A creditor with a $4,500 claim receives 60% of $4,500 = $2,700.
