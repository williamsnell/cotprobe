Okay, so I have this problem here where Sam bought 18 stamps for $8.28, and I need to figure out how much 12 stamps would cost at the same rate. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I guess I should find out how much one stamp costs. If 18 stamps cost $8.28, then each stamp is 8.28 divided by 18. Let me do that calculation. So 8.28 รท 18. Hmm, I can maybe simplify this by dividing both numerator and denominator by 6 to make it easier. 8.28 divided by 6 is 1.38, and 18 divided by 6 is 3. So that becomes 1.38 รท 3. Now, 1.38 divided by 3 is 0.46. Wait, that doesn't seem right because 0.46 times 18 would be more than 8.28. Let me check that again.

Wait, maybe I should just do the division directly. 8.28 divided by 18. Let me think: 18 times 0.4 is 7.20. Subtracting that from 8.28 leaves 1.08. Then, 18 times 0.06 is 1.08. So adding 0.4 and 0.06 gives me 0.46. Oh, so each stamp is $0.46. Okay, that makes sense.

Now, to find out the cost for 12 stamps, I multiply 0.46 by 12. Let's calculate that. 0.46 times 10 is 4.60, and 0.46 times 2 is 0.92. Adding those together, 4.60 + 0.92 equals $5.52. So 12 stamps would cost $5.52.

Wait, but let me double-check the initial calculation. Is each stamp really $0.46? Let me multiply 0.46 by 18. 0.46 * 10 is 4.60, 0.46 * 8 is 3.68. Adding those gives 4.60 + 3.68 = 8.28, which matches the given total. So yes, each stamp is $0.46.

Multiplying 0.46 by 12 again: 0.46 * 10 is 4.60, 0.46 * 2 is 0.92, so total is 5.52. That seems correct.

Looking at the options, option C is $5.52. So that should be the answer.

The cost per stamp is $0.46, so 12 stamps cost 12 ร $0.46 = $5.52.

Answer: C
