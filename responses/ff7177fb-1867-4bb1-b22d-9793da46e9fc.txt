Okay, so I've got this question about Bayesian networks and how many independent parameters are needed for a given structure. The network is described as H -> U <- P <- W. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

First, I remember that Bayesian networks represent variables as nodes and their dependencies as directed edges. The structure here seems to have H pointing to U, which is also pointed to by P, and P points to W. So it's like H influences U, P influences both U and W, and W is influenced by P.

The question is about calculating the number of independent parameters. I think this involves determining the number of probability distributions each node contributes and then subtracting any dependencies due to conditional probabilities.

Let me break down each node:

1. **H**: It's a root node, so it doesn't have any parents. The number of parameters for H would be based on its own probability distribution. If H is binary (which is common), it would have 2 possible states. The number of parameters for a single node is equal to the number of states minus one because the last state is determined by the others (they sum to 1). So if H has 2 states, it contributes 1 parameter.

Wait, but I'm not sure what the actual variables are. The question doesn't specify the number of states each variable has. Oh, right, I think in such problems, it's often assumed that each variable is binary unless stated otherwise. So let's proceed with that assumption.

2. **U**: It has two parents, H and P. So U is conditionally dependent on both H and P. The number of parameters for U's conditional probability would be based on the number of possible combinations of H and P. Since each is binary, there are 2 * 2 = 4 combinations. For each combination, U can have a probability, but since it's a distribution, we subtract one parameter. So 4-1=3 parameters for U.

Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, no—U's probability is conditioned on H and P. So the number of parameters for U is (number of states of H) * (number of states of P) * (number of states of U - 1). Since each is binary, it's 2*2*(2-1)=4 parameters. Wait, but that's the number of entries in the table, right? But since the sum must be 1, you subtract one. So 4-1=3 parameters for U.

3. **P**: P has no parents, so it's a root node. Like H, it’s binary, so it contributes 1 parameter.

4. **W**: It has one parent, P. So W's conditional probability depends on P. Since P is binary, there are 2 states. So W's parameters would be (2) * (2-1) = 2 parameters. Wait, 2 states of P, each with a probability for W being 0 or 1. So for each state of P, there are two probabilities, but subtract one because they sum to 1. So for each P state, we have one parameter. So 2 parameters in total for W.

Now, adding them up: H contributes 1, U contributes 3, P contributes 1, W contributes 2. So total is 1+3+1+2=7. Hmm, but that's not one of the options. Wait, the options are A:3, B:10, C:2, etc. So 7 isn't an option. Oh, maybe I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the parameters. Let me go through each node again.

H: binary, no parents. Parameters: 1.

U: depends on H and P, both binary. So the number of possible states for H and P is 2^2=4. Each state has a probability for U being 0 or 1, but we subtract one because probabilities sum to 1. So 4*(2-1)=4 parameters for U.

Wait, that's different from what I thought earlier. So U contributes 4 parameters.

P: binary, no parents. 1 parameter.

W: depends on P (binary). So for each of P's two states, W has two probabilities, but subtract one. So 2*(2-1)=2 parameters.

Now adding: H (1) + U (4) + P (1) + W (2) = 8 parameters total.

Looking at the options, D is 8. So the answer should be D:8.

The Bayesian network structure H -> U <- P <- W is analyzed to determine the number of independent parameters. Each node's parameters are calculated based on its states and dependencies:

- **H**: Binary with no parents → 1 parameter.
- **U**: Depends on H and P (both binary) → 4 parameters.
- **P**: Binary with no parents → 1 parameter.
- **W**: Depends on P → 2 parameters.

Summing these gives 1 + 4 + 1 + 2 = 8 parameters.
