Okay, so I have this problem about Mr. Okada's property taxes and figuring out how much goes towards education. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, I need to understand what's given. Mr. Okada's home is worth $28,750. The town assesses homes at 38% of their market value. So, I think that means the assessed value is 38% of $28,750. I should calculate that first.

So, 38% of 28,750. Let me do that calculation. 38% is the same as 0.38. So, 0.38 multiplied by 28,750. Hmm, 28,750 times 0.38. Let me compute that. 28,750 * 0.38. Well, 28,750 times 0.3 is 8,625, and 28,750 times 0.08 is 2,300. So adding those together, 8,625 + 2,300 equals 10,925. So the assessed value is $10,925.

Next, he pays property taxes at a rate of $8.42 per $100. I think that means for every $100 of assessed value, he pays $8.42 in taxes. So I need to calculate his total property taxes. 

To do that, I should find out how many hundreds are in the assessed value of $10,925. So, 10,925 divided by 100 is 109.25. So there are 109.25 hundreds in $10,925. 

Now, multiply that by the tax rate of $8.42. So, 109.25 * 8.42. Hmm, that might be a bit tricky. Let me break it down. 

First, 100 * 8.42 = 842. Then, 9.25 * 8.42. Let me calculate 9 * 8.42 = 75.78, and 0.25 *8.42 is 2.105. Adding those together, 75.78 + 2.105 = 77.885. So the total tax would be 842 + 77.885 = 919.885. Rounding that, it's approximately $919.89.

Wait, but let me double-check that multiplication. Maybe I should do it another way. Let's see: 109.25 * 8.42. Alternatively, 109.25 * 8 = 874, and 109.25 * 0.42. Let's compute 109.25 * 0.4 = 43.7, and 109.25 * 0.02 = 2.185. So, 43.7 + 2.185 = 45.885. Now add that to 874: 874 + 45.885 = 919.885. Yep, same result. So total taxes are $919.89.

Now, the question is about how much of his taxes goes towards education. It says 47% of his property taxes is spent on education. So I need to find 47% of $919.89.

Calculating 47%: 0.47 * 919.89. Let me do that. 900 * 0.47 is 423. 19.89 * 0.47. Let me compute 19 * 0.47 = 8.93, and 0.89 *0.47≈0.4183. Adding those gives 8.93 + 0.4183 ≈9.3483. So total is 423 + 9.3483 ≈432.3483. So approximately $432.35.

Wait, but let me check another way. 919.89 * 0.47. Let's break it down:

919.89 * 0.4 = 367.956

919.89 * 0.07 = about 64.3923

Adding those together: 367.956 + 64.3923 = 432.3483. So yes, around $432.35.

Looking at the options, D is $432.35. So that's the answer.

The amount of property taxes Mr. Okada pays is calculated by first determining the assessed value of his home, which is 38% of $28,750. This gives an assessed value of $10,925. The property tax rate is $8.42 per $100 of assessed value, so multiplying 10,925 by 8.42 divided by 100 yields a total property tax of $919.89. Since 47% of this tax is allocated to education, 47% of $919.89 is approximately $432.35.

Answer: D
