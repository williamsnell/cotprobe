Okay, so I have this question about vitamin D and its functions. I'm a bit rusty on my vitamins, but I'll try to think it through. The question is asking which of the options is NOT a function of vitamin D. The options are A through F.

First, I remember that vitamin D is important for bone health. I think it helps with calcium absorption, so F: Regulation of bone turnover sounds right. That makes sense because bone turnover involves the breakdown and formation of bone, and vitamin D plays a role in that.

Option A is about the immune system. I've heard that vitamin D has some role in immune function, maybe helping the body fight infections or something like that. So A is probably a function.

Option B is muscle strength. I remember reading that vitamin D deficiency can lead to muscle weakness, so it must regulate muscle strength. So B is a function too.

Option C is the regulation of adipocyte differentiation. Adipocytes are fat cells, and differentiation means how they develop from stem cells into fat cells. Hmm, I'm not sure about this one. I know that vitamin D affects various cells, but I'm not certain about adipocytes. I'll have to think more.

Option D is glucose metabolism. I'm not too sure about this. I know that vitamin D is involved in calcium and bone, but does it impact how the body processes sugar? Maybe. I think there's some research linking vitamin D to diabetes, so perhaps it does regulate glucose metabolism. So D might be a function.

Option E is being a lipid-soluble antioxidant in cell membranes. Wait, vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin, but is it an antioxidant? Antioxidants like vitamin C are water-soluble, and others like vitamin E are lipid-soluble. I don't recall vitamin D acting as an antioxidant. Antioxidants usually neutralize free radicals, but I don't think that's a primary function of vitamin D. So E might be the incorrect function.

Putting it together: The functions I'm confident about are bone health (F), immune system (A), muscle strength (B). I'm uncertain about C and D. If C is about adipocytes, maybe vitamin D does influence that. I think it might have a role in cell differentiation, so C could be a function. 

So the options that are not functions would be E, because I don't think vitamin D acts as an antioxidant. Therefore, the answer is E.

The answer is E. Vitamin D is not a lipid-soluble antioxidant in cell membranes. 

Answer: E
