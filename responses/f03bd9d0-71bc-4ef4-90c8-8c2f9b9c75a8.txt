Okay, so I have this economics question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by breaking down the question and the options.

The question is asking: If the economy is operating at full employment, which policy will create the most inflation in the short run? The options are A through J, each involving different combinations of government spending and taxes.

First, I remember that when the economy is at full employment, the unemployment rate is low, and the economy is producing at its potential output. At this point, any increase in aggregate demand (AD) would lead to inflation because the economy can't produce more goods and servicesâ€”it's already maxed out.

Now, the policies in the options are all about fiscal policy tools: government spending and taxes. I need to recall how these affect aggregate demand. Government spending is a component of AD, so increasing it would shift AD to the right. Conversely, decreasing spending would shift AD left. Taxes affect disposable income; higher taxes mean people have less to spend, so AD decreases, and lower taxes mean more spending, increasing AD.

Inflation happens when AD increases beyond the current output, so the policy that increases AD the most will cause more inflation. But wait, some options involve both spending and taxes changing. I need to calculate the net effect on AD.

Looking at each option:

A: Increase in taxes, no change in spending. Higher taxes reduce disposable income, so AD decreases. This would reduce inflation, not cause it. So A is not the answer.

B: No change in spending or taxes. AD remains the same, so no inflation. Not the answer.

C: Increase in spending matched by equal increase in taxes. Let's see: spending up increases AD, but higher taxes decrease AD. So overall, the net effect is zero. No change in AD, so no inflation. Not the answer.

D: Decrease in spending and increase in taxes. Both reduce AD. So this would decrease inflation. Not the answer.

E: Increase in spending, no change in taxes. Spending up increases AD. At full employment, this would lead to higher inflation. This is a candidate.

F: Decrease in taxes and increase in spending. Both actions increase AD. Decrease in taxes increases disposable income, and increase in spending directly adds to AD. So this would cause a bigger increase in AD than just E. So F might be worse for inflation than E.

G: Decrease in spending, no change in taxes. AD decreases, so less inflation. Not the answer.

H: Increase in taxes and decrease in spending. Both reduce AD. So this would lower inflation. Not the answer.

I: Decrease in taxes, no change in spending. Lower taxes increase disposable income, so AD increases. This would cause inflation, but possibly less than if spending is also increased.

J: Decrease in taxes and increase in spending. Both cause AD to increase. So this would have the biggest increase in AD, leading to the most inflation.

Wait, let me clarify. The options are about the short run, so we're considering the impact on AD and thus inflation. The bigger the AD shift, the more inflation.

Option E: Only spending increases. So AD increases by the amount of the spending increase.

Option I: Only taxes decrease, so AD increases by the tax multiplier effect. The tax multiplier is usually less than the spending multiplier because taxes are a leakage, so the impact might be smaller than a direct spending increase.

Option F: Taxes decrease and spending increases. Both are pro-AD, so their combined effect would be the sum of E and I, leading to a larger AD shift.

Option J: Same as F? Wait, J says decrease in taxes and increase in spending. So that's the same as F. Wait, no, looking back, F is "a decrease in taxes with an increase in government spending." Yes, same as J? Wait, no, let me check:

Wait, looking back: Option J says "A decrease in taxes and an increase in government spending." So it's the same as F? Wait, no, let me look again: Option F is "A decrease in taxes with an increase in government spending." So F is the same as J? Hmm, perhaps I'm confused. Wait, no, looking again, the options are:

F: Decrease in taxes, increase in spending.

J: Decrease in taxes and increase in spending. So they are the same? Or perhaps I misread. Wait, no, probably each option is unique. Let me check again.

Wait, the options are:

E: Increase spending, no taxes.

F: Decrease taxes, increase spending.

I: Decrease taxes, no spending.

J: Decrease taxes, increase spending. Wait, that's the same as F. No, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me check the original options again.

Wait, the user wrote:

Options:

E: An increase in government spending with no change in taxes

F: A decrease in taxes with an increase in government spending

I: A decrease in taxes with no change in government spending

J: A decrease in taxes and an increase in government spending

Wait, so F and J are the same? Because F says decrease taxes and increase spending, same as J. That can't be right. Maybe I misread; perhaps F is "decrease taxes and increase spending" while J is "decrease taxes and increase spending"? No, that can't be. Wait, perhaps the user made a typo, but assuming they are distinct, perhaps F is decrease taxes and increase spending, and J is the same. But that's not possible. Alternatively, perhaps F is just decrease taxes without spending, but no, the user wrote:

F: A decrease in taxes with an increase in government spending.

J: A decrease in taxes and an increase in government spending.

Wait, so F and J are the same. That can't be; perhaps it's a typo, and I should proceed as if each option is unique. Alternatively, perhaps I should treat them as separate, but that would complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in reading.

Wait, perhaps F is "a decrease in taxes and an increase in government spending," same as J. That can't be; perhaps I'm misreading. Let me check again.

Wait, the options as presented:

F: A decrease in taxes with an increase in government spending.

J: A decrease in taxes and an increase in government spending.

Hmm, they seem the same. That's a problem because two options would be identical. But perhaps it's a mistake in the question. Alternatively, perhaps F is "decrease taxes and increase spending," while J is "decrease taxes and increase spending." But that's the same.

Wait, perhaps I need to proceed without that confusion. Let's proceed.

So, the policies that increase AD the most are those that either increase spending, decrease taxes, or both.

At full employment, the most inflation would come from the biggest AD increase.

So, the biggest AD increase would be from both increasing spending and decreasing taxes. Because both actions add to AD.

The tax multiplier is usually smaller than the spending multiplier. For example, if taxes decrease by X, disposable income increases by X, and consumption increases by some fraction of that, say, MPC*X. Meanwhile, an increase in government spending directly increases AD by the same amount, say, G.

So, if both happen, the total AD increase is G + (MPC * X), assuming X is the tax cut.

Thus, the policy that increases spending and cuts taxes would cause the largest AD increase, leading to the most inflation.

Looking back at the options, which option does that?

Option E: Only increase spending. AD increases by G.

Option F: Decrease taxes and increase spending. AD increases by G + (MPC * T). So more than E.

Option J: Same as F? Or perhaps I'm misreading. Wait, let me check the options again.

Looking back:

E: Increase spending, no taxes.

F: Decrease taxes, increase spending.

I: Decrease taxes, no spending.

J: Decrease taxes and increase spending.

Wait, so F and J are the same. That's odd. Maybe it's a typo, and J is meant to be something else. Alternatively, perhaps J is "increase in taxes and increase in spending," but that's not the case.

Assuming that F and J are separate, but they describe the same policy, which would be the case if J is "decrease taxes and increase spending," same as F. That would be an error, but perhaps I should proceed.

In that case, the correct answer would be the option that combines both increasing spending and cutting taxes, which would be F (or J, if they are the same). But since the options should be unique, perhaps I'm misreading.

Alternatively, perhaps J is "decrease in taxes and increase in government spending," which is the same as F. So maybe the correct answer is J, but perhaps the options are intended to have only one correct choice.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the options as given.

Option E: Only spending up. AD increases by G.

Option F: Spending up and taxes down. AD increases by G + (MPC * T). So more than E.

Option I: Only taxes down. AD increases by MPC*T.

Option J: Same as F.

Thus, the policy that leads to the most inflation is F (or J, if they are the same), as it combines both a spending increase and a tax cut, leading to the largest AD increase.

But wait, in the options, the correct answer would be J if it's the same as F, but perhaps the intended answer is F or J. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, perhaps the intended correct answer is E, but no, because combining both spending and taxes would have a bigger effect.

So, the most inflation would come from the biggest AD increase, which is when both spending is increased and taxes are decreased.

Thus, the correct answer is F or J, but since in the options, F is "decrease taxes with an increase in spending," and J is "decrease taxes and increase spending," which are the same. So perhaps the intended answer is J.

Wait, but looking back, the options are:

F: A decrease in taxes with an increase in government spending.

J: A decrease in taxes and an increase in government spending.

They are the same. So perhaps the intended correct answer is J, but that's a problem because F and J are the same.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is E, but no, because F/J would have a bigger impact.

Wait, perhaps I should proceed with the assumption that the correct answer is E, but no, that's not correct because combining both would cause more inflation.

So, the correct answer is the option that both increases spending and decreases taxes, which is F or J. But since F and J are the same, perhaps the intended answer is J.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is E, but that's not right.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the size of the fiscal policy. The maximum inflation would come from the biggest fiscal expansion, which is a combination of spending increase and tax cut.

Thus, the correct answer is F or J, but as per the options given, perhaps F is the intended answer.

Wait, but looking at the options again, perhaps J is a separate option that combines both, so the answer is J.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the options as given.

In the options, E is only spending up, F is spending up and taxes down, I is only taxes down, and J is same as F.

But perhaps the intended answer is E, but that's not correct. The correct answer is the one that increases both spending and cuts taxes, leading to the largest AD increase.

So, the correct answer is F or J. But since they are the same, perhaps the correct answer is J.

Wait, but the options list F and J as separate, so perhaps I made a mistake in reading. Let me check again.

Looking back at the options:

F: A decrease in taxes with an increase in government spending.

J: A decrease in taxes and an increase in government spending.

Wait, perhaps F is a decrease in taxes and an increase in spending, same as J. So perhaps the correct answer is J, as it's the same as F, but perhaps the intended answer is F.

Alternatively, perhaps I should proceed with the assumption that the correct answer is E, but that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is F, which is a decrease in taxes and an increase in spending, leading to the biggest AD increase.

Thus, the correct answer is F or J. But since they are the same, perhaps the intended answer is J.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the fiscal policy multipliers.

The spending multiplier is typically around 1/(1-MPC), and the tax multiplier is MPC/(1-MPC). So, if both are increased, the total multiplier effect is larger.

Thus, the policy that increases spending and cuts taxes would have a larger impact on AD, leading to more inflation.

So, the correct answer is the option that does both: increase spending and decrease taxes. That's options F and J, but as per the options given, perhaps F and J are the same. Assuming that, the correct answer is F or J.

But since the options are presented as separate, perhaps I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is E, but no.

In any case, the correct answer is the one that combines both an increase in spending and a decrease in taxes, leading to the largest AD increase and thus the most inflation.

The correct answer is **J**. When the economy is at full employment, increasing government spending and decreasing taxes leads to the largest increase in aggregate demand (AD), causing the most inflation. This is because both actions directly stimulate economic activity, with the combined effect of higher spending and lower taxes having a greater impact than either policy alone.

     Answer: J
