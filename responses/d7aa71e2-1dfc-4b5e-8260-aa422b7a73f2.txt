Okay, so I've got this question here about calculating total wealth based on expected annual income and an interest rate. Hmm, I'm trying to remember how these kinds of problems work. I think it's related to present value or maybe future value, but I'm not entirely sure which one applies here.

The question says: If the expected annual income is $20,000 and the rate of interest is 9.8%, what is the total wealth? The options are from A to J, with various amounts. I need to figure out the correct formula to use.

Wait, I think total wealth in this context refers to the present value of a perpetuity. Because it's an annual income that's expected to continue indefinitely, so a perpetuity makes sense. The formula for the present value of a perpetuity is annual income divided by the interest rate. So, it's PV = C / r, where C is the annual cash flow and r is the discount rate or interest rate.

Let me plug in the numbers. The annual income (C) is $20,000, and the interest rate (r) is 9.8%, which is 0.098 in decimal form. So, PV = 20,000 / 0.098. Let me calculate that.

20,000 divided by 0.098. Hmm, let me do this step by step. 20,000 divided by 0.1 is 200,000, right? Because 0.1 is 10%, so 20,000 / 0.1 = 200,000. But here, the rate is 9.8%, which is slightly less than 10%, so the present value should be a bit higher than 200,000. Because a lower denominator would give a higher value.

Let me compute it more accurately. 20,000 / 0.098. Maybe I can rewrite it as 20,000 ÷ (98/1000) because 0.098 is 98/1000. So, 20,000 ÷ (98/1000) is the same as 20,000 * (1000/98). That simplifies to (20,000 * 1000) / 98. 20,000 * 1000 is 20,000,000. Then divide by 98.

So, 20,000,000 ÷ 98. Let me do that division. 98 times 204,081 is approximately 20,000,000 because 98 * 204,081.632653 = 20,000,000 exactly. So, 20,000,000 ÷ 98 is approximately 204,081.63. So, the present value is about $204,081.63.

Looking at the options, option G is $204,082, which is very close to my calculation. So, that must be the correct answer. I think that's it. So, the total wealth would be option G.

The correct answer is G, calculated using the present value of a perpetuity formula: PV = $20,000 / 0.098 ≈ $204,082.

Answer: G
