Question:

A man was the owner of the newly constructed hotel in a city. On March 15, the man received a telephone call from a salesperson who was a distributor of hotel equipment. The salesperson offered to sell the man 1,000 fire extinguishers for his hotel. The salesperson told the man that the cost of the fire extinguishers would be $35,000 (or $35 apiece), payable 90 days after delivery. The salesperson promised to have the fire extinguishers installed no later than April 15. On March 16, the man telephoned the salesperson and accepted the offer. The following day, the man mailed the following memo to the salesperson:"Please be advised that I shall take a 15 percent discount for cash payment seven days after installation. " The salesperson received the man's correspondence on March 20. On April 1, the salesperson sent a telegram to the man, stating: "It's apparent we don't have an enforceable contract in effect. I will not be delivering the fire extinguishers on April 15 or any other time. "The man brings suit against the salesperson for breach of contract. The salesperson asserts the defense of the statute of frauds under the UCC. Which of the following is the most accurate statement regarding the salesperson's defenses?

Options:

A: The salesperson's defense is valid, because the man failed to pay for the fire extinguishers within the specified 90 days.
B: The salesperson's defense is valid, because the man's memo was inconsistent with the terms of the salesperson's oral offer.
C: The salesperson's defense is valid, because the man's memo was not sufficient to indicate that a contract was formed.
D: The salesperson's defense is not valid, because the salesperson has breached the contract by failing to deliver the fire extinguishers on the agreed date.
E: The salesperson's defense is not valid, because the man's memo is considered a written contract under the UCC.
F: The salesperson's defense is valid, because the man's memo did not include a signature, which is required for a contract to be valid under the UCC.
G: The salesperson's defense is not valid, because under the UCC the statute of frauds is not applicable in agreements between merchants.
H: The salesperson's defense is not valid, because the man accepted the offer before the salesperson decided to terminate it.
I: The salesperson's defense is not valid, because the salesperson failed to respond to the man's memo within a reasonable period of time.

Okay, let's try to figure out this question. It's about contract law, specifically the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) and the Statute of Frauds. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

So, the scenario is that a man owns a new hotel and receives a call from a salesperson offering to sell him 1,000 fire extinguishers for $35 each, totaling $35,000. The terms are that payment is due 90 days after delivery, and the salesperson will install them by April 15. 

On March 16, the man accepts the offer by calling the salesperson. Then, on March 17, he sends a memo to the salesperson saying he wants a 15% discount if he pays cash seven days after installation. The salesperson receives this on March 20. 

Then, on April 1, the salesperson sends a telegram saying they don't have an enforceable contract and won't deliver the extinguishers. The man sues for breach of contract, and the salesperson claims the Statute of Frauds as a defense.

The question is whether the salesperson's defense is valid. The options are A through I, each giving a different reason.

First, I need to recall what the Statute of Frauds requires under the UCC. From what I remember, the Statute of Frauds requires certain contracts to be in writing to be enforceable. Specifically, under UCC ยง 2-201, a contract for the sale of goods priced at $500 or more must be in writing and signed by the party against whom enforcement is sought. 

In this case, the goods are 1,000 fire extinguishers at $35 each, totaling $35,000. That's well over $500, so the Statute of Frauds applies. So, if there's no writing, the contract might not be enforceable unless an exception applies.

Now, the man accepted the offer orally on March 16. Then, he sent a memo on March 17. The salesperson received it on March 20. The memo says he wants a 15% discount if he pays cash seven days after installation. So, the man is trying to modify the terms.

I think the key here is whether the memo constitutes a written contract under the UCC. The memo is a written communication, but does it satisfy the requirements of the Statute of Frauds?

The UCC requires a signed writing. The memo doesn't have a signature, just a typed name perhaps? Wait, the memo says "Please be advised..." and is sent as a letter. But it doesn't mention a signature. So, the memo isn't signed by the man. Under the Statute of Frauds, the writing must be signed by the party against whom enforcement is sought. Here, the man is suing the salesperson, so the salesperson is the one who needs to be able to enforce against the man. Wait, no, the man is the buyer, so if the salesperson is the seller, the seller would need a writing signed by the buyer to enforce the contract. But in this case, the man is the one bringing the suit against the seller for breach. So the seller would need a signed writing from the buyer to enforce the contract. But here, the issue is whether the oral agreement plus the memo creates an enforceable contract.

Wait, but the man's memo is trying to modify the terms. The original offer was cash within 90 days after delivery. The man is offering to pay 15% less if he pays cash seven days after installation. That's a counter-offer or a modification.

Under contract law, a modification can be made without consideration unless it's under a statute that requires it. But more importantly, for the Statute of Frauds, if the modification brings the contract under the $500 threshold, it might not require a writing. But here, the total is still $35,000, so it's way over.

But wait, the original contract, if it's oral, might not satisfy the Statute of Frauds. So, unless there's a written memorandum that satisfies the requirements, the contract isn't enforceable.

The memo from the man says he wants a discount for cash payment. It's a written statement, but it's not a signed agreement. The UCC requires the writing to be signed by the party against whom enforcement is sought. So, if the salesperson is trying to enforce the contract, they need the man's signature. But in this case, the man is suing the salesperson, so the salesperson would need a written agreement signed by the man to enforce it. However, the man's memo isn't signed. So, does the oral acceptance plus the memo suffice?

Alternatively, maybe the oral agreement is sufficient as an initial acceptance, but the Statute of Frauds requires a writing for sales over $500. So, without a writing, the contract isn't enforceable. But wait, the man sent a memo, but it's not a contract because it's not signed. 

Wait, but the man accepted the offer orally. So, the contract was formed orally. But under the Statute of Frauds, an oral contract for goods over $500 isn't enforceable unless there's a writing. So, the salesperson's defense would be that the contract isn't enforceable because it wasn't in writing. 

But wait, the man sent a memo. Does that count as a sufficient writing? The memo says he wants a discount. It's a modification, but does it serve as a written agreement? The memo isn't a signed agreement. The UCC requires the writing to be signed. So, the memo without a signature might not suffice.

Looking at the options, E says the salesperson's defense isn't valid because the man's memo is a written contract. But for it to be a valid contract under the Statute of Frauds, it needs to be signed. The memo doesn't have a signature, so E might not be correct.

Option F says the memo didn't include a signature, so the defense is valid. That seems plausible because without a signature, the writing doesn't satisfy the Statute of Frauds.

Wait, but the oral contract was formed on March 16. Then, on March 17, the man sent a memo trying to modify the terms. The salesperson didn't accept this modification. The salesperson sent a telegram on April 1 saying there's no enforceable contract. 

So, if the oral agreement was sufficient, but the Statute of Frauds requires a writing, then the contract isn't enforceable unless the memo serves as that writing. But without a signature, it doesn't. So, the salesperson can defend on the Statute of Frauds, making their defense valid.

Looking at the options, option F says the salesperson's defense is valid because the memo lacks a signature. That seems correct.

Alternatively, option E says the memo is a written contract, but without a signature, it's not valid under the UCC. So, E is incorrect.

Another angle: The Statute of Frauds requires a writing that indicates a contract was formed. The memo says he wants a discount, but it's a modification. If the original oral agreement was for $35,000, and the memo is a modification, perhaps the memo doesn't create a new contract but just proposes a change. The salesperson didn't accept the modification, so the original contract was oral and unenforceable. 

So, the salesperson's defense is valid because the contract wasn't in writing and signed. Therefore, the correct answer is F.
