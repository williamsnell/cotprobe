Question:

A woman owned land in fee simple absolute. The woman conveyed the land to a friend "for life," and when the friend died the land was to go to the woman's neighbor "and her heirs." The neighbor died and in her duly probated will devised her entire estate to a local charity. If she had died intestate, her daughter would have been her only heir. One year after the neighbor died, her daughter executed a quitclaim deed conveying any interest she might have in the land to the woman's friend. The common law Rule Against Perpetuities is unmodified in the jurisdiction. There are no other applicable statutes. Who has what interest in the land?

Options:

A: The friend has a life estate and the woman has a reversion, because the neighbor's remainder was void under the Rule Against Perpetuities.
B: The friend has a fee simple absolute, because his life estate merged with the remainder conveyed to him by the daughter.
C: The friend has a life estate and the charity has a contingent remainder, because the neighbor's interest was devisable and her will transferred her entire estate.
D: The friend has a fee simple absolute, because the quitclaim deed from the daughter transferred any interest she might have had in the land.
E: The friend has a life estate and the daughter has a contingent remainder, because the deed from the woman created an interest in the neighbor's heirs.
F: The friend has a life estate and the daughter has a vested remainder, because the deed from the woman created an interest in the neighbor's heirs.
G: The friend has a life estate and the woman's neighbor has a vested remainder, because the deed from the woman created an interest in the neighbor.
H: The friend has a life estate and the charity has a vested remainder, because the neighbor's interest was devisable.
I: The friend has a life estate and the local charity has a contingent remainder, because the neighbor's will transferred her entire estate.
J: The friend has a life estate and the woman's neighbor has a contingent remainder, because the neighbor's will devised her entire estate to a local charity.

Okay, so I have this property law question about the Rule Against Perpetuities and future interests. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The woman owned land in fee simple absolute, which means she had the highest possible ownership. She conveyed the land to her friend "for life," and when the friend died, the land was to go to her neighbor "and her heirs." So, from this conveyance, I think the friend gets a life estate, and the neighbor has a remainder. The question is about what type of remainderâ€”whether it's vested or contingent, and whether it violates the Rule Against Perpetuities.

Wait, the Rule Against Perpetuities (RAP) says that any contingent future interest must vest, if at all, within 21 years after a life in being at the time of the conveyance. If it doesn't, the interest is void.

In this case, the remainder is given to the neighbor and her heirs. Heirs are determined at the time of death, so the neighbor's interest is a remainder subject to the RAP. Is it a vested remainder or a contingent one? Well, since the neighbor is living at the time of the conveyance, she has a vested remainder subject to open (because her heirs could change, but she's alive so it's vested as to her). So the remainder is a vested remainder subject to open. But under RAP, does this vest within the period?

Wait, the remainder is to the neighbor and her heirs. Since the neighbor is alive, the remainder is vested in her. The interest is to her and her heirs, so when the friend dies, the land goes to the neighbor's estate, and then to her heirs. But the issue is whether the neighbor's interest is valid under RAP.

Wait, the RAP applies to contingent remainders. Vested remainders don't need to satisfy RAP. So if the neighbor has a vested remainder, then RAP doesn't apply. But wait, the problem says the jurisdiction hasn't modified RAP, so maybe I'm missing something.

Alternatively, maybe the interest is a contingent remainder because the neighbor's heirs could include people not yet born. Hmm, but the neighbor is alive, so her interest is vested. So the RAP doesn't invalidate it because it's a vested remainder.

Wait, the conveyance was to the friend for life, then to the neighbor and her heirs. So the neighbor's interest is a vested remainder subject to open. So under RAP, since it's vested, it's okay. Therefore, the neighbor's remainder is valid.

Now, the neighbor dies and in her will, she devises her entire estate to a local charity. But the problem says that if she had died intestate, her daughter would have been her only heir. So her will transferred her entire estate, which presumably includes any interest she had in the land.

But wait, the neighbor's interest was a vested remainder subject to open. When she dies, her heirs would take any interest she had. But she devised everything to charity. So does that mean the charity gets her interest?

Wait, but the land was conveyed to the friend for life, then to the neighbor and her heirs. So the neighbor's interest was a remainder. She died, and her will says her entire estate goes to charity. So her interest in the land (the remainder) would pass under her will, right? So the charity would take her remainder.

But wait, the daughter executed a quitclaim deed after the neighbor died, conveying any interest she might have in the land to the friend. So the daughter, as the neighbor's heir, would have inherited the neighbor's remainder if the neighbor had died intestate. But the neighbor had a will, so the daughter's deed is conveying any interest she might have had from intestacy, but since the neighbor's will devised everything, maybe the daughter didn't have any interest. Or did she?

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let me try to outline the chain of events.

1. Woman conveys to friend for life, remainder to neighbor and her heirs.

- Friend has life estate.
- Neighbor has vested remainder subject to open.

2. Neighbor dies, leaving a will that gives everything to charity.

- If the neighbor had died intestate, her daughter would have been her only heir, so the remainder would have gone to the daughter and her heirs.
- But she made a will, so her estate (including her interest in the land) goes to charity. So the charity now has the remainder.

3. Daughter executes a quitclaim deed, conveying any interest she might have in the land to the friend.

- But wait, did the daughter have any interest? The neighbor's will devised everything, so unless the will was invalid or didn't cover the land, the daughter wouldn't have inherited anything from the neighbor. So the daughter's quitclaim deed probably didn't convey anything, because she didn't have any interest.

So after the neighbor's death, the charity has the remainder. The friend still has the life estate. So the friend has a life estate, and the charity has a vested remainder.

Wait, but the question is about whether the neighbor's remainder was valid under RAP. Since the neighbor was alive when the conveyance was made, her remainder was vested, so RAP doesn't apply, making it valid. So the charity receives her vested remainder.

But looking at the options, option H says the friend has a life estate and the charity has a vested remainder. That would be correct if the daughter's deed doesn't affect anything.

Wait, but option I says the friend has a life estate and the charity has a contingent remainder. Why would it be contingent?

Because maybe the daughter's deed affects it. The daughter conveyed any interest she might have. But she didn't have any interest because the neighbor's will gave everything to charity. So the daughter's deed is ineffective. Therefore, the charity has the vested remainder.

So looking at the options, option H is "The friend has a life estate and the charity has a vested remainder, because the neighbor's interest was devisable."

Wait, but the neighbor's interest was a vested remainder subject to open. She could devise it, so when she died, the charity took her interest.

Alternatively, maybe the remainder was a contingent one. Wait, no, because the neighbor was alive, so it's vested.

Wait, but the original conveyance was to the neighbor and her heirs. So the neighbor's interest is a vested remainder subject to open. When she dies, her heirs would take, but because she made a will, the charity gets it. So the charity's interest is a vested remainder, not contingent.

So the correct answer would be H: The friend has a life estate and the charity has a vested remainder.

But wait, looking at the options, option H is exactly that. But another option is I, which says the charity has a contingent remainder. Why would that be?

Alternatively, perhaps the remainder to the neighbor and her heirs is a contingent remainder because it depends on the neighbor surviving the friend. But no, because the neighbor was alive at the conveyance. So it's vested.

Wait, maybe I'm confusing. Let me think again.

The conveyance is to friend for life, then to neighbor and her heirs. So at the time of conveyance, the neighbor is alive, so she has a vested remainder subject to open. Her heirs could change, but it's vested as to her. So under RAP, because it's vested, it doesn't violate RAP.

So the neighbor's interest is valid. She can devise it. So when she dies, the charity gets her vested remainder. The friend still has the life estate.

So the correct answer is H.

But let me check the options again.

Option H: Friend has life estate, charity has vested remainder.

Option I: Friend has life estate, charity has contingent remainder.

So why would it be contingent? Maybe because the neighbor's will devised her entire estate, which included the land. But the neighbor's interest was a vested remainder, so when she dies, the charity takes it. Thus, it's a vested remainder for the charity.

Therefore, the correct answer is H.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because the daughter conveyed her interest. But since the neighbor's will gave everything to charity, the daughter didn't have any interest to convey. So the daughter's quitclaim deed doesn't affect anything.

So the friend has a life estate, charity has the vested remainder. So the answer is H.
</think>

The woman conveyed the land to her friend for life, with a remainder to the neighbor and her heirs. This created a life estate for the friend and a vested remainder subject to open for the neighbor. The Rule Against Perpetuities (RAP) does not apply to vested remainders, so the neighbor's interest is valid. Upon the neighbor's death, her will devised her entire estate, including her vested remainder, to the charity. The daughter's quitclaim deed is ineffective because the neighbor's will divested her of any interest to convey. Therefore, the friend retains a life estate, and the charity holds a vested remainder.

**Answer: H**
