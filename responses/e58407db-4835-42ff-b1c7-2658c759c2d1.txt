Alright, so I need to figure out the answer to this Bible question. The question is asking about the sister of Moses and Aaron. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that Moses and Aaron were important figures in the Bible, especially in the Old Testament. They were leaders of the Israelites during their exodus from Egypt. I think they had a sister who played a role in their story, maybe even in the miracles or the exodus events.

I'm trying to recall the names of their siblings. From what I remember, Moses and Aaron had a sister named Miriam. I think she was a prophetess and a leader as well. She was involved in the deliverance of the Israelites, perhaps in the early parts of their history.

Looking at the options provided, I see that Miriam is option E. The other options are names like Jochebed, Esther, Leah, Rebecca, Martha, Ruth, Naomi, Deborah, and Sarah. Let's go through them to make sure I'm not mixing up names from different parts of the Bible.

Jochebed (A) is mentioned in the Bible as the wife of Amram, the father of Moses, Aaron, and Miriam. So she's the mother, not the sister. Esther (B) is the queen from the Book of Esther, which is in the Old Testament but much later, so she's not related to Moses. Leah (C) is the sister of Rachel, the wife of Jacob, so that's from the patriarchal narratives, not the exodus.

Rebecca (D) is another matriarch, the wife of Isaac and mother of Jacob and Esau, so she's earlier in the timeline. Martha (F) is from the New Testament, a friend of Jesus, so that's too late. Ruth (G) is the Moabite woman who joined the Israelites, from the Book of Ruth. Naomi (H) is her mother-in-law. Deborah (I) is a prophetess and judge, but she's from a later period, I think during the time of the judges, not the exodus. Sarah (J) is the wife of Abraham, the mother of Isaac.

So, narrowing it down, the only name that fits as the sister of Moses and Aaron is Miriam, which is option E. I'm pretty confident that's the correct answer because I remember her being mentioned in the context of their early history and the exodus.
