Answer:
    
<think>
Okay, so I have this problem about dividends and growth rates. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I remember from my finance classes that when a stock is priced as a growing perpetuity, the price is determined by the Gordon Growth Model. The formula, if I recall correctly, is P = D1 / (r - g), where P is the price, D1 is the next dividend, r is the required return, and g is the growth rate.

Wait, let me make sure. So D1 is the dividend next year. Since the last dividend paid was $3, and if the growth rate is g, then D1 should be 3*(1+g). Right? So D1 = 3(1 + g).

The company's expected return on equity is 12%, so that's r = 12% or 0.12. The current stock price is $75, so P = 75.

Putting it all into the formula: 75 = 3(1+g) / (0.12 - g). Hmm, I need to solve for g here.

Let me write that equation again:

75 = [3*(1 + g)] / (0.12 - g)

First, I'll multiply both sides by (0.12 - g) to get rid of the denominator:

75*(0.12 - g) = 3*(1 + g)

Let me compute 75*0.12. 75 times 0.12 is 9. So:

9 - 75g = 3 + 3g

Wait, that's because 75*(0.12) is 9, and 75*(-g) is -75g. On the right side, 3*(1) is 3, and 3*g is 3g.

Now, let's bring like terms together. I'll add 75g to both sides and subtract 3 from both sides:

9 -3 = 75g + 3g

Which simplifies to:

6 = 78g

So, g = 6 / 78. Let me calculate that. 6 divided by 78 is the same as 1/13, which is approximately 0.0769 or 7.69%. Wait, but that's not one of the options. Let me check my calculations again because the options don't have 7.69%.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the algebra. Let me go through it again:

75*(0.12 - g) = 3*(1 + g)

Expanding both sides:

75*0.12 - 75g = 3 + 3g

Which is 9 -75g = 3 +3g

Now, moving all terms to one side. Let's subtract 3 from both sides:

9 -3 = 75g +3g → 6 = 78g

So 78g =6 → g=6/78=0.076923, which is about 7.69%. But the options don't have that. Hmm. Did I make a mistake somewhere?

Wait, let me check the options again. The options are A:0%, B:6%, C:4%, D:10%, E:-4%, F:-8%, G:8%, H:20%, I:16%, J:12%.

So 7.69% isn't an option. Did I use the correct formula? Let me think again. Oh wait, maybe I should be using the current dividend D0 instead of D1. Because the formula uses D1, which is D0*(1+g). So D1 is 3*(1+g). So my setup was correct.

Wait, maybe I should rearrange the equation differently. Let me try again.

75 = [3*(1+g)] / (0.12 - g)

Multiply both sides by denominator:

75*(0.12 - g) = 3*(1 + g)

75*0.12 is 9, so 9 -75g =3 +3g

Bring variables to one side and constants to the other:

-75g -3g = 3 -9 → -78g = -6 → 78g =6 → g=6/78=0.0769, same as before.

Hmm, but none of the options match. Let me check if I misread the question. The problem states the expected return on equity is 12%, which is r. The stock is at $75, and last dividend was $3. So the setup is correct.

Wait, maybe the question is expecting me to use the dividend yield approach. Wait, no, because it's a growing perpetuity, so the Gordon model is the right approach.

Wait another thought: Maybe the question is phrased differently. Let me think about the required growth rate for the price to stay at $75 given r=12%. So, perhaps I can rearrange the formula to solve for g.

Alternatively, perhaps I made an error in the calculation. Let me try plugging in the options to see which one gives P=75.

Option B is 6% growth. Let's see: D1 =3*(1.06)=3.18. Then P=3.18/(0.12-0.06)=3.18/0.06=53. That's lower than 75, so not correct.

Option C is 4%: D1=3.12; P=3.12/(0.12-0.04)=3.12/0.08=39. Still too low.

Option G is 8%: D1=3.24; P=3.24/(0.12-0.08)=3.24/0.04=81. Closer, but higher than 75.

Option J is 12%: D1=3.36; P=3.36/(0.12-0.12)= division by zero, which is impossible, so J can't be right.

Looking at option B again: 6% growth gives P=53; that's lower than 75. So perhaps I need a lower growth rate. Wait, wait, because as g increases, the denominator (r -g) decreases, so P increases. Wait, if g is higher, the denominator gets smaller, making P larger. So, when I calculated 7.69%, which is between 6% and 8%, P would be between 53 and 81.

But 75 is between 53 and 81, so the correct g should be between 6% and 8%. Let me check the options again. The options are B:6%, G:8%, but no option in between. Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake in the algebra.

Wait, another approach: Let's rearrange the equation.

From P = D1/(r -g), and D1 = D0*(1+g), so:

P = [D0*(1+g)] / (r -g)

We can rearrange this as:

P*(r -g) = D0*(1+g)

75*(0.12 -g) =3*(1+g)

Which is what I did earlier. So 75*(0.12 -g) =3*(1 +g)

Let me compute 75*(0.12 -g) =3 +3g.

75*0.12 is 9, so 9 -75g =3 +3g.

Bring all terms to left:

9-3 =75g +3g →6=78g →g=6/78=0.0769 or 7.69%.

But since that's not an option, perhaps I need to recheck the problem statement.

Wait, the question says the last dividend was $3, and they're asking for the growth rate to make the price $75 with a required return of 12%. So maybe I'm missing something. Let me try with option C:4%.

g=4%, so D1=3.12.

P=3.12/(0.12-0.04)=3.12/0.08=39. Nope, too low.

Option G:8% gives P=81, as above. So 75 is between 39 and 81, which would suggest a g between 4% and 8%. But the options don't have that. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the problem is using g as the growth rate in dividends, but perhaps the formula is P = D0 / (r -g). No, that's not right because D0 is the current dividend, and the next dividend is D1. So the correct formula uses D1.

Wait, perhaps I should use D0 in the formula. Let me try that.

If I mistakenly used D0 instead of D1, then the formula would be P = D0 / (r -g). Let's try that.

75=3/(0.12 -g)

So 0.12 -g =3/75=0.04 → g=0.12-0.04=0.08 or 8%, which is option G.

But wait, that's not correct because the formula uses D1, not D0. So I'm confused. Did I make a mistake in using D0 instead of D1?

Because if I use D0, I get g=8%, which is option G, but that's not the right approach. The correct formula should use D1, so perhaps the answer isn't among the options, but that can't be the case because it's a multiple-choice question.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the initial setup. Let me think again.

The correct formula is P = D1/(r -g), and D1 = D0*(1+g). So P = [D0*(1+g)]/(r -g).

So plugging in the numbers:

75 = [3*(1+g)]/(0.12 -g)

Multiply both sides by denominator:

75*(0.12 -g) =3*(1+g)

As before, 9 -75g =3 +3g → 6=78g →g=6/78=0.0769, which is approximately 7.69%.

Since that's not an option, perhaps the problem expects us to use D0 instead of D1. Let's try that.

If I use P = D0/(r -g), then:

75=3/(0.12 -g) →0.12 -g=3/75=0.04 →g=0.12-0.04=0.08 or 8%, which is option G.

But that's incorrect because the formula should use D1, not D0. Unless the problem is using D0, which is a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the growth rate to be 8%, even though that's not the correct approach.

Wait, but looking back, when I used g=8%, the price came out to be 81, which is higher than 75. So that's not matching. So perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but that's not possible. Maybe I made a miscalculation.

Wait, let me check the calculation again:

75*(0.12 -g) =3*(1+g)

75*0.12 =9, correct.

So 9 -75g =3 +3g.

Subtract 3 from both sides:6 -75g =3g.

Add 75g to both sides:6=78g →g=6/78=0.0769, which is 7.69%.

So the correct growth rate is approximately 7.69%, but the closest option is not present. So perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the problem.

Wait, another angle: Maybe the required return is 12%, but the growth rate is negative. Let me try option E: -4%.

So g=-4%, D1=3*(0.96)=2.88.

P=2.88/(0.12 - (-0.04))=2.88/0.16=18. That's way lower than 75. So not correct.

Option F: -8%, D1=3*0.92=2.76. P=2.76/(0.12+0.08)=2.76/0.20=13.8. Still too low.

Option D:10%, D1=3.3. P=3.3/(0.12-0.10)=3.3/0.02=165. That's way higher than 75.

Hmm, none of these seem to fit. I'm stuck. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial equation setup.

Wait, another approach: Let me write the equation again.

75 = [3*(1+g)] / (0.12 -g)

Let me rearrange terms:

75*(0.12 -g) =3*(1 +g)

Divide both sides by 3:

25*(0.12 -g) =1 +g

25*0.12=3, so 3 -25g =1 +g

Bring like terms:

3-1=25g +g →2=26g →g=2/26≈0.0769 or 7.69%.

Same result as before. So perhaps the correct answer isn't listed, but the closest is option B:6% or G:8%. Let me see what the price would be at 6% and 8%.

At 6%, D1=3.18, P=3.18/(0.12-0.06)=53.

At 8%, D1=3.24, P=3.24/(0.04)=81.

Since 75 is between 53 and 81, and growth rate between 6% and 8%, but no option exists for that. So perhaps the intended answer is 8%, but that would give a price higher than 75. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the dividend yield formula without considering growth, but that's not the case here.

Alternatively, maybe the required return is 12%, so 12% = (D1 + gP)/P.

Wait, that's another formula. Let me think. The required return r equals the dividend yield plus the growth rate. So r = (D1/P) + g.

So, 0.12 = (3*(1+g)/75) + g.

Let me compute that.

0.12 = [3*(1+g)]/75 + g.

Simplify [3*(1+g)]/75: that's (3/75)*(1+g)=0.04*(1+g).

So, 0.12 =0.04*(1+g) +g.

Expand:0.12=0.04 +0.04g +g →0.12=0.04 +1.04g.

Subtract 0.04:0.08=1.04g →g=0.08/1.04≈0.0769, or 7.69%. Again, same result.

So the correct growth rate is approximately 7.69%, but the options don't have that. The closest option would be B:6% or G:8%, but neither gives exactly 75. Maybe the intended answer is 8%, but that's not matching. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to round to the nearest option, but 7.69% is closer to 8% than 6%.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Let me try solving the equation 75 = 3*(1+g)/(0.12 -g) again.

Let me set it up as:

3*(1+g) =75*(0.12 -g)

3 +3g =9 -75g

Bring all terms to one side:

3 +3g +75g -9=0 →78g -6=0 →78g=6 →g=6/78=0.0769, same as before.

I think I'm stuck. Since none of the options match, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup. Let me check again: The last dividend is $3, the required return is 12%, and the price is $75. So the formula should be correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the perpetuity formula without growth, meaning g=0. Let's see what that gives.

If g=0, P=3/0.12=25. That's way below 75. So not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the required return is 12%, but the growth rate is such that the price is 75. Let me try option B:6%.

As before, P=53, which is lower than 75. So not correct.

Option G:8% gives P=81, which is higher than 75. So perhaps the correct answer isn't listed, but given the options, maybe the intended answer is 8%, but that's not correct. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should try each option and see which one gives a price closest to 75.

Option B:6% growth.

D1=3*(1.06)=3.18. P=3.18/(0.12-0.06)=3.18/0.06=53. Not 75.

Option C:4% growth.

D1=3.12. P=3.12/0.08=39. No.

Option G:8% growth.

D1=3.24. P=3.24/0.04=81. Closer to 75 than 53, but still not matching.

Option J:12% growth.

D1=3.36. P=3.36/(0.12-0.12)= undefined. So no.

Option I:16% growth.

D1=3.48. P=3.48/(0.12-0.16)=3.48/-0.04=-87. Negative price, which doesn't make sense.

Option D:10% growth.

D1=3.3. P=3.3/(0.12-0.10)=3.3/0.02=165. Way higher.

Option E:-4% growth.

D1=3*0.96=2.88. P=2.88/(0.12 - (-0.04))=2.88/0.16=18.

Option F:-8% growth.

D1=3*0.92=2.76. P=2.76/(0.12 - (-0.08))=2.76/0.20=13.8.

Option A:0% growth.

P=3/0.12=25.

So none of the options give exactly 75. The closest is option G:8%, which gives P=81, but that's higher than 75. Alternatively, perhaps the intended answer is 8%, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I should check if I made a mistake in the initial setup. Let me think again.

The formula is correct, right? P = D1/(r -g), and D1=3*(1+g). So 75=3*(1+g)/(0.12 -g).

Yes, that's correct. So solving for g gives approximately 7.69%, which isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects us to use the current dividend D0 as D1. Let me see what that would give.

If I mistakenly use D0=3 as D1, then:

75=3/(0.12 -g) →0.12 -g=3/75=0.04 →g=0.08, which is option G:8%.

But that's incorrect because D1 should be 3*(1+g), not 3. So that approach is wrong, but perhaps that's what the problem expects.

In that case, the answer would be option G:8%. But I'm not confident because it's based on a mistake in the formula.

The question involves determining the dividend growth rate \( g \) that ensures the stock price of $75 is consistent with the Gordon Growth Model (GGM). The formula for the stock price in a growing perpetuity is:

\[
P = \frac{D_1}{r - g}
\]

Where:
- \( P = 75 \) (current stock price),
- \( D_1 = D_0 \times (1 + g) \) (next year's dividend),
- \( r = 12\% = 0.12 \) (required return),
- \( D_0 = 3 \) (last dividend).

### Step 1: Rearrange the GGM Formula
Substitute \( D_1 = 3 \times (1 + g) \) into the formula:

\[
75 = \frac{3 \times (1 + g)}{0.12 - g}
\]

### Step 2: Solve for \( g \)
Multiply both sides by \( (0.12 - g) \):

\[
75 \times (0.12 - g) = 3 \times (1 + g)
\]

Simplify:

\[
9 - 75g = 3 + 3g
\]

Combine like terms:

\[
6 = 78g
\]

\[
g = \frac{6}{78} \approx 0.0769 \text{ or } 7.69\%
\]

### Step 3: Compare with Options
The calculated growth rate \( g \approx 7.69\% \) does not match any of the provided options. To verify, each option was tested by calculating the implied stock price using the GGM formula:

- **Option B (6\%):**  
  \( D_1 = 3 \times 1.06 = 3.18 \)  
  \( P = \frac{3.18}{0.12 - 0.06} = 53 \) (too low).

- **Option G (8\%):**  
  \( D_1 = 3 \times 1.08 = 3.24 \)  
  \( P = \frac{3.24}{0.12 - 0.08} = 81 \) (higher than 75).

Since \( g = 7.69\% \) is not listed, the closest option is **G: 8\%**, even though it results in a slightly higher stock price.

ANSWER: G
