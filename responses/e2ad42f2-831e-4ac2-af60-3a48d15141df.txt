Okay, so I have this question about the Intelligence Quotient, or IQ, and I need to figure out which formula correctly defines it. The options are labeled A through J, and each one is a different mathematical expression involving chronological age, mental age, verbal score, and performance score. Hmm, I remember that IQ tests have been around for a long time, and the concept of IQ is pretty standard, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula.

Let me start by recalling what IQ generally represents. I think it's a measure of a person's intelligence relative to their peers. The original idea, I believe, was developed by Alfred Binet and later adapted by Lewis Terman. The key term I remember is "mental age." So, mental age is like the age level a person is functioning at intellectually, compared to their chronological age, which is their actual age.

So, the formula for IQ, as I remember, is something like IQ equals (mental age divided by chronological age) multiplied by 100. That would make sense because it normalizes the score relative to the person's age. For example, if a 10-year-old has a mental age of 12, their IQ would be (12/10)*100 = 120, which is above average.

Looking at the options now:

A: chronological age/verbal score × 100 – That seems off because it's using chronological age over verbal, which doesn't align with mental age.

B: mental age/performance score × 100 – Hmm, performance score isn't something I remember. Maybe it's a distractor.

C: chronological age/performance score × 100 – Again, performance score is unclear, so probably not.

D: verbal score/chronological age × 100 – Doesn't fit the mental age concept.

E: verbal score/performance score × 100 – No, that's unrelated.

F: chronological age/mental age × 100 – Wait, that's the inverse of what I think. If it's chronological over mental, that would give a lower IQ for someone with higher mental age, which doesn't make sense.

G: verbal score/mental age × 100 – Not sure about verbal here. Maybe not.

H: performance score/verbal score × 100 – Doesn't sound right.

I: performance score/mental age × 100 – Again, performance isn't part of the original formula.

J: mental age/chronological age × 100 – Yes, this matches what I was thinking. It's mental age divided by chronological age, multiplied by 100.

Wait, let me double-check. The formula is IQ = (MA/CA) × 100. So option J is exactly that: mental age over chronological age times 100. That makes sense. So I think J is the correct answer.
</think>

The Intelligence Quotient (IQ) is defined as the ratio of mental age to chronological age, multiplied by 100. This aligns with the formula IQ = (Mental Age / Chronological Age) × 100. Among the given options, only option J matches this definition.

Answer: J
