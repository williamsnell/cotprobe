Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about which countries have high secondary school enrollment as of 2020. The options are A through J, each listing four countries. I need to figure out which one is correct.

First, I should recall what secondary school enrollment means. It's the percentage of the relevant age group (usually around 15-18 years old) that's enrolled in secondary education. Higher enrollment rates indicate more access to education in that country.

I remember that developed countries generally have higher enrollment rates, but some developing countries also do pretty well. For example, countries in Latin America like Uruguay and Costa Rica tend to have higher education access. On the other hand, Sub-Saharan African countries like Niger often have lower enrollment rates due to various socio-economic factors.

Let me go through each option:

Option A: Peru, Uruguay, Cambodia, and Niger. Wait, Peru and Uruguay are known for higher enrollment, but Niger is quite low, so this mix seems inconsistent. Maybe A isn't the right choice.

Option B: Pakistan, Niger, Peru, and Bhutan. Pakistan and Bhutan I'm not too sure about. I think Pakistan's enrollment might be lower, and Bhutan I'm not certain. This mix doesn't seem to align with high enrollment.

Option C: Bhutan, Cambodia, Uruguay, and Costa Rica. Uruguay and Costa Rica are probably high, but Bhutan and Cambodia? I think their enrollment rates might not be as high. I'm not sure about Bhutan's stats.

Option D: Costa Rica, Colombia, Niger, and Timor-Leste. Costa Rica and Colombia are likely high, but Niger and Timor-Leste are probably low. So this mix doesn't seem right.

Option E: Bhutan, Niger, Cambodia, and Costa Rica. Again, Niger and Cambodia are probably lower, while Costa Rica is high. Doesn't fit.

Option F: Timor-Leste, Pakistan, Peru, and Bhutan. Peru is high, but Timor-Leste and Pakistan are low. So F doesn't seem correct.

Option G: Niger, Bhutan, Timor-Leste, and Colombia. Colombia is high, but the others are low. So G is probably not the answer.

Option H: Cambodia, Timor-Leste, Uruguay, and Pakistan. Uruguay is high, but the others are low. So H is unlikely.

Option I: Colombia, Peru, Uruguay, and Costa Rica. All these countries are in Latin America and I think they have relatively high secondary enrollment rates. Colombia, Peru, Uruguay, and Costa Rica are known for their education systems being more developed compared to other regions. This seems like a strong candidate.

Option J: Uruguay, Costa Rica, Timor-Leste, and Pakistan. Timor-Leste and Pakistan have lower enrollment rates, so J is probably incorrect.

So putting it all together, the correct option should be I: Colombia, Peru, Uruguay, and Costa Rica. These are all countries with higher secondary school enrollment rates, especially compared to the other options which include countries with lower rates.

The correct answer is I: Colombia, Peru, Uruguay, and Costa Rica, as these countries are known for having higher secondary school enrollment rates.

Answer: I
