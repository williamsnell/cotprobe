Okay, so I have this problem about a ship moving through water, and I need to find the distance downstream where the boundary layer becomes turbulent, the boundary layer thickness at that point, and the total friction drag coefficient. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I remember that the transition from laminar to turbulent flow in a boundary layer occurs at a certain Reynolds number. The problem states that the maximum Reynolds number before the flow becomes turbulent is 5 × 10^5. So, I need to find where along the ship's hull this Reynolds number is reached.

The ship is moving at 7.59 knots. Oh wait, knots are nautical miles per hour. I think I need to convert that to feet per second because the other units given are in feet and seconds. Let me calculate that.

1 knot is approximately 1.687 feet per second. So, 7.59 knots would be 7.59 * 1.687 ≈ let me do the math. 7 * 1.687 is about 11.809, and 0.59 * 1.687 is roughly 0.99. Adding them together gives around 12.80 ft/s. Wait, let me check that again. 7.59 * 1.687: 7*1.687=11.809, 0.59*1.687≈0.991. So total is 11.809 + 0.991 = 12.80 ft/s. So the ship's speed V is approximately 12.8 ft/s.

Next, the Reynolds number Re_x is given by (rho * V * x) / mu, where x is the distance downstream. We set Re_x equal to 5e5 to find x.

Given rho is 1.94 slugs/ft³, V is 12.8 ft/s, and mu ( viscosity ) is given as 1.21e-5 ft²/s.

So plugging into Re_x = (rho * V * x) / mu = 5e5.

Let me rearrange for x: x = (Re_x * mu) / (rho * V).

Substituting the numbers: x = (5e5 * 1.21e-5) / (1.94 * 12.8).

Calculating numerator: 5e5 * 1.21e-5 = 5 * 1.21 = 6.05.

Denominator: 1.94 * 12.8 ≈ let's compute that. 1.94 * 12 = 23.28, 1.94 * 0.8 = 1.552. So total is 23.28 + 1.552 = 24.832.

So x ≈ 6.05 / 24.832 ≈ let's see, 6 / 24.8 is about 0.242, but 6.05 is a bit more. Let me compute 6.05 ÷ 24.832. Let me do that division: 24.832 goes into 6.05 how many times? 24.832 * 0.243 is approx 6.047, so x ≈ 0.243 feet. Wait, that's about 0.243 ft, which is a bit over 0.24 ft. But looking at the options, none of them are around 0.24. Hmm, did I make a mistake in the units?

Wait, maybe I messed up the conversion from knots to ft/s. Let me double-check that. 1 knot is 1.687 ft/s, correct. So 7.59 * 1.687: 7 * 1.687 = 11.809, 0.59 * 1.687. Let's compute 0.5 * 1.687 = 0.8435, 0.09 * 1.687 ≈ 0.1518. So total 0.8435 + 0.1518 ≈ 0.9953. So total 11.809 + 0.9953 ≈ 12.8043 ft/s. That seems right.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating Re_x. Let me try another approach. Wait, perhaps I used the wrong formula. Oh, wait, the formula for Reynolds number for boundary layer along a flat plate is Re_x = (V * x * rho) / mu. Yes, that's correct.

Wait, but perhaps I should use the dynamic viscosity, which is given as 1.21e-5 ft²/s. So that's correct.

So x = (5e5 * 1.21e-5) / (1.94 * 12.8).

Wait, 5e5 is 500,000. 500,000 * 1.21e-5 = 500000 * 0.0000121 = 6.05. Correct.

Denominator: 1.94 *12.8 = let me compute it more accurately. 1.94 * 12 = 23.28, 1.94 * 0.8 = 1.552. So total 24.832. So 6.05 /24.832 is approximately 0.2435 ft, which is about 0.244 ft. That's around 0.24 ft. But looking at the options, the closest is option F at 0.48 ft, but that's double. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, wait. Oh no! Wait, perhaps I'm using the wrong value for V. Because the problem says the ship is moving at 7.59 knots relative to still water. So the velocity is 7.59 knots, which I converted to 12.8 ft/s. But maybe I should use the speed in ft/s correctly.

Wait, perhaps I can calculate it more precisely. Let me compute 7.59 knots to ft/s.

1 knot = 1.687 ft/s, so 7.59 * 1.687 = ?

Let me compute 7 * 1.687 = 11.809.

0.59 * 1.687: 0.5 * 1.687 = 0.8435, 0.09 * 1.687 = 0.15183. So 0.8435 + 0.15183 = 0.99533.

Total V = 11.809 + 0.99533 = 12.80433 ft/s. So that's correct.

So x ≈ 6.05 / 24.832 ≈ 0.2435 ft. So approximately 0.244 ft. But none of the options have something close to that. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A: 0.55 ft, 0.0110 ft, 2.50 × 10^-3

B: 0.5 ft, 0.0100 ft, 1.00 × 10^-3

C: 0.62 ft, 0.0115 ft, 2.20 × 10^-3

D: 0.42 ft, 0.0120 ft, 2.00 × 10^-3

E: 0.47 ft, 0.0102 ft, 1.92 × 10^-3

F: 0.48 ft, 0.0090 ft, 1.70 × 10^-3

G: 0.53 ft, 0.0105 ft, 1.50 × 10^-3

H: 0.60 ft, 0.0095 ft, 1.80 × 10^-3

I: 0.35 ft, 0.0135 ft, 2.10 × 10^-3

J: 0.40 ft, 0.0085 ft, 2.30 × 10^-3

Hmm, none of these options are close to 0.24 ft. That's strange. Did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Wait, maybe I messed up the formula. Let me check again.

Re_x = (rho * V * x) / mu.

Wait, mu is the dynamic viscosity, which is given as 1.21e-5 ft²/s. Correct.

So x = (Re_x * mu) / (rho * V).

Plugging in Re_x = 5e5, mu =1.21e-5, rho=1.94, V=12.8 ft/s.

So x = (5e5 * 1.21e-5) / (1.94 * 12.8) = (6.05) / (24.832) ≈ 0.2435 ft.

Wait, perhaps the options have a typo, or I made a mistake in the units somewhere. Alternatively, perhaps the problem refers to the distance from the bow, but maybe I'm using the wrong formula. Wait, maybe the problem is considering water flow over the ship's surface, but perhaps using the ship's speed in a different way. Or maybe I should consider the length of the ship or something else, but I don't think that's given.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for the transition point correctly. Another thought: maybe the question is about the point where the boundary layer becomes turbulent, which is when Re_x exceeds 5e5. So I'm solving for x when Re_x = 5e5, which is correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of x. Let me compute it again.

Compute denominator: 1.94 * 12.8.

1.94 * 12 = 23.28.

1.94 * 0.8 = 1.552.

Adding gives 23.28 + 1.552 = 24.832.

Numerator: 5e5 * 1.21e-5 = 5e5 * 1.21e-5 = (5 * 1.21) * 1e5 * 1e-5) = 6.05 * 1e0 = 6.05.

So x = 6.05 /24.832 ≈ 0.2435 ft. So 0.244 ft, which is approximately 0.24 ft.

But none of the options are close to that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the speed conversion. Oh wait, maybe I should use the exact value for knots to ft/s.

Let me check the exact conversion: 1 knot is exactly 1.68744 ft/s. So 7.59 knots is 7.59 * 1.68744.

Compute 7 *1.68744 = 11.81208.

0.59 *1.68744: Let's compute 0.5 *1.68744=0.84372, 0.09 *1.68744=0.15187. So total 0.84372 + 0.15187=0.99559.

Adding to 11.81208 gives 11.81208 +0.99559=12.80767 ft/s.

So V=12.80767 ft/s.

Now recalculate x: (5e5 * 1.21e-5) / (1.94 *12.80767).

Compute denominator: 1.94 *12.80767.

Let me compute 1.94 *12 =23.28, 1.94 *0.80767≈1.94 *0.8=1.552, 1.94 *0.00767≈0.01487. So total 23.28 +1.552=24.832 +0.01487≈24.84687.

So denominator≈24.84687.

Numerator still 6.05.

x=6.05 /24.84687≈0.2433 ft. Still about 0.243 ft.

Hmm, this isn't matching any of the options. Maybe I'm missing something else.

Wait, perhaps the problem refers to the boundary layer thickness at the point where Re_x=5e5, and the drag coefficient is for the entire surface, but perhaps I should compute those as well.

The boundary layer thickness delta at Re_x is given by delta = (nu * x) / V. Because for laminar flow, delta = (nu/(rho V)) * Re_x^(1/2). Wait, no, wait: delta is (nu / (rho V x)) * something? Wait, no. Let me think. For laminar boundary layer, the thickness at a point x is delta = (nu / V) * (Re_x)^(1/2). Wait, no, because Re_x = (rho V x)/ mu. Since mu = rho nu, Re_x = (V x)/(nu), so delta ≈ (nu/V) * sqrt(Re_x). Wait, let me check the formula.

Wait, for a flat plate, the boundary layer thickness at a distance x is given by delta ≈ (nu * x) / (V * sqrt(2 Re_x)) ), but I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, another formula is delta = (nu)/(V) * (Re_x)^{1/2} * (some constant). Wait, perhaps the general formula is delta ≈ (nu * x) / (V * (Re_x)^{1/2} )).

Wait, no, let me think again. The Reynolds number is Re_x = (rho * V * x) / mu. Since mu = rho * nu, Re_x = (V x) / nu. So, Re_x = V x / nu → x = Re_x * nu / V.

Then, delta for laminar flow is approximately (nu * x)^(1/2) / (k * V), where k is some constant. Alternatively, a common approximation is delta ≈ (nu * x) / (V * (Re_x^{1/2})). Hmm, maybe I should look for the correct formula.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula for the boundary layer thickness in the laminar flow region. The formula is delta ≈ (nu * x) / (V * (2 Re_x)^{1/2})). Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here, maybe I should look for an exact formula.

Alternatively, the boundary layer thickness can be found using delta = (nu * x) / (V) * (some function of Re_x). For very high Re_x, the boundary layer thickness can be approximated as delta ≈ (nu * x) / (V) * (0.38) / (Re_x^{1/5}), but that's for turbulent flow. Wait, no, that's for friction factor in turbulent flow.

Wait, perhaps for the transition point, we can use the laminar flow formula. The standard formula for the boundary layer thickness in laminar flow is delta = (nu * x) / (V) * (Re_x)^{1/2} ) / (some constant). Wait, I think I'm getting this wrong. Let me try to find the correct formula.

Wait, I think the correct formula for boundary layer thickness in laminar flow is delta = (nu * x) / (V * (Re_x)^{1/2}) ) * (some constant). Alternatively, perhaps delta = (nu * x) / (V) * (1 / (Re_x^{1/5})), but that might be for other cases.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find delta using the relation delta ≈ (nu * x) / (V) * (some factor). Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula delta = (nu * x) / (V) * (0.38) / (Re_x^{1/5}), but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I can use the formula delta = (nu * x) / (V) * (0.38) / (Re_x^{1/5}), but since Re_x is 5e5, which is the transition point, perhaps it's better to use the exact formula for laminar flow, which is delta = (nu * x) / (V) * (1 / (Re_x^{1/2}) )).

Wait, that might not be correct. Let me think again. Another approach: since Re_x = (V x)/(nu), then x = Re_x * nu / V. So substituting into delta, if delta is proportional to (nu x)/V, then delta = (nu * (Re_x * nu / V )) / V = Re_x * (nu²) / V².

Wait, but that seems off. Alternatively, perhaps the boundary layer thickness in laminar flow is given by delta = (nu * x) / (V) * (some constant), but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the approximation that at transition, delta = (nu * x) / (V) * (0.38) / (Re_x^{1/5}), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is delta = (nu * x) / (V) * (0.38) / (Re_x^{1/5}), but I'm not certain. Let me try to proceed.

Given that x is approximately 0.2435 ft, and nu is 1.21e-5 ft²/s, V is 12.80767 ft/s.

So, delta = (1.21e-5 * 0.2435) / 12.80767.

Calculating numerator: 1.21e-5 * 0.2435 ≈ 2.946e-6.

Denominator: 12.80767.

So delta ≈ 2.946e-6 /12.80767 ≈ 2.304e-7 ft. That seems way too small. That can't be right.

Wait, that can't be correct because 2.3e-7 ft is about 2.76e-6 inches, which seems too thin. Maybe I'm using the wrong formula.

Wait, perhaps the boundary layer thickness at transition is given by delta = (nu * x) / (V) * (some constant). Let me think: another formula I've heard is delta = (nu * x) / (V) * (0.38) / (Re_x^{1/5}), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula delta = (nu * x) / (V) * (some function of Re_x). Wait, maybe for Re_x around 5e5, the boundary layer thickness can be approximated as delta ≈ (nu * x) / (V) * (0.38) / (Re_x^{1/5}).

Let me try that. So, Re_x =5e5.

Compute Re_x^{1/5}: 5e5^(1/5). Let's compute that. 5e5 is 500,000. The fifth root of 500,000.

I know that 10^5 is 100,000, so fifth root is 10. 500,000 is 5 *1e5, so fifth root is (5)^(1/5) *1e1. 5^(1/5) is approximately 1.3797. So Re_x^(1/5) ≈ 13.797.

So delta ≈ (1.21e-5 * 0.2435) / 12.80767 * 0.38 / 13.797.

Wait, wait, perhaps the formula is delta ≈ (nu * x) / (V) * (0.38)/(Re_x^{1/5}).

So, let's compute:

(nu * x) = 1.21e-5 * 0.2435 ≈ 2.946e-6.

Divide by V: 2.946e-6 /12.80767 ≈ 2.304e-7.

Multiply by 0.38: 2.304e-7 *0.38 ≈ 8.955e-8.

Divide by Re_x^(1/5)=13.797: 8.955e-8 /13.797 ≈ 6.48e-9 ft, which is way too small. That doesn't make sense.

I think I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps the boundary layer thickness can be found using the formula delta = (nu / (rho V)) * Re_x^{1/2}.

Wait, because Re_x = (rho V x)/mu, and mu = rho nu, so Re_x = (V x)/(nu). So x = Re_x * nu / V.

Then, delta for laminar flow is approximately delta = (nu * x) / (V) * (some constant). Alternatively, perhaps delta = (nu * x) / (V) * (1/(Re_x^{1/2})).

Wait, let me try that.

So delta = (nu * x) / (V) * (1/(Re_x^{1/2})).

Plugging in the numbers: nu=1.21e-5, x=0.2435, V=12.80767, Re_x=5e5.

Re_x^{1/2}=sqrt(5e5)= approx 707.1068.

So delta = (1.21e-5 * 0.2435) / 12.80767 * (1/707.1068).

Compute numerator: 1.21e-5 *0.2435 ≈ 2.946e-6.

Divide by V: 2.946e-6 /12.80767 ≈ 2.304e-7.

Multiply by 1/707.1068: 2.304e-7 * (1/707.1068) ≈ 3.257e-10 ft. That's even smaller, which can't be right.

Wait, this isn't working. Maybe I should use a different approach. Perhaps the boundary layer thickness formula is delta = (nu * x) / (V) * (some constant), but I'm not finding the right formula. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the approximate formula that at transition, delta ≈ 0.001 ft or something, but that's a guess.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the boundary layer thickness at transition is small, but looking at the options, the delta values are around 0.01 ft, which is about an inch. Hmm, maybe I should compute it differently.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me try to compute x again.

Wait, perhaps I should use V in ft/min or another unit? No, because the units for mu are ft²/s, so ft/s is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for the total friction drag coefficient, which is given as the third part of the question. Let me think about that.

The total friction drag coefficient, C_f, for the turbulent flow region is typically given by the empirical relation C_f = 0.074 / Re_x^{1/5}, but that's for smooth plates in the fully turbulent regime. However, since we're at the transition point, maybe we should use a different formula. Alternatively, perhaps for the laminar flow up to x, and turbulent beyond, but the problem states to find the point where it becomes turbulent, so perhaps the drag coefficient is for the turbulent flow starting from that point.

Wait, but the question says to determine the drag coefficient for this portion of the surface. So perhaps it's the drag coefficient up to that point. Wait, no, the question says "the total friction drag coefficient for this portion of the surface of the ship." So perhaps it's the coefficient for the turbulent flow beyond that point.

But I'm not sure. Let me think. The drag coefficient in the turbulent flow is usually lower than in the laminar flow. For example, in laminar flow, C_f might be around 0.005 to 0.01, and in turbulent flow, around 0.001 to 0.003.

Looking at the options, the drag coefficients are in the range of 1e-3 to 2.5e-3. So perhaps the correct C_f is around 0.001 to 0.0025.

Wait, but I'm not sure how to compute it exactly. Maybe I should proceed with the first part and see if any of the options match, even if my x calculation doesn't. Let me look at the options again.

Options:

A: 0.55 ft, 0.0110 ft, 2.50 × 10^-3

B: 0.5 ft, 0.0100 ft, 1.00 × 10^-3

C: 0.62 ft, 0.0115 ft, 2.20 × 10^-3

D: 0.42 ft, 0.0120 ft, 2.00 × 10^-3

E: 0.47 ft, 0.0102 ft, 1.92 × 10^-3

F: 0.48 ft, 0.0090 ft, 1.70 × 10^-3

G: 0.53 ft, 0.0105 ft, 1.50 × 10^-3

H: 0.60 ft, 0.0095 ft, 1.80 × 10^-3

I: 0.35 ft, 0.0135 ft, 2.10 × 10^-3

J: 0.40 ft, 0.0085 ft, 2.30 × 10^-3

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of x. Let me recheck the calculation.

x = (Re_x * mu) / (rho * V).

Re_x=5e5, mu=1.21e-5, rho=1.94, V=12.80767.

So x = (5e5 * 1.21e-5) / (1.94 *12.80767).

Compute numerator: 5e5 *1.21e-5 =5 *1.21=6.05.

Denominator: 1.94 *12.80767= let me compute it accurately.

1.94 *12 =23.28.

1.94 *0.80767= let's compute:

0.8 *1.94=1.552.

0.00767 *1.94≈0.01487.

So total 1.552 +0.01487=1.56687.

So 23.28 +1.56687=24.84687.

So x=6.05 /24.84687≈0.2435 ft.

Wait, perhaps the options have a typo and I should proceed with this value, but none match. Alternatively, perhaps I should re-express 0.2435 ft as 2.922 inches, which is about 29 inches. But the options are all larger than that, so perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the distance downstream from the bow, but perhaps the ship's length is involved, but the problem doesn't mention the ship's length. So I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the conversion from knots to m/s instead of ft/s. Wait, no, because the other units are in ft.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the speed in m/s. Wait, but the problem gives rho in slugs/ft³ and mu in ft²/s, so using ft/s is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for Re as (V * x * rho) / mu, but perhaps I should use the dynamic pressure formula. No, that's not necessary.

Wait, maybe I should think differently. Perhaps the problem is using the formula for the transition point where the boundary layer becomes turbulent, but perhaps the formula is Re_x = 5e5, and I'm correct in calculating x as ~0.24 ft, but none of the options match. So perhaps I made a mistake elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the question is not about the point where the flow becomes turbulent, but where it starts to become turbulent, which might involve a different approach. Alternatively, perhaps the question is using the length of the boundary layer in a different way.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the boundary layer thickness delta using the formula delta = (nu * x) / (V), regardless of Re_x. Let me try that.

So delta = (1.21e-5 * 0.2435) / 12.80767 ≈ (2.946e-6) / 12.80767 ≈ 2.304e-7 ft. That's 2.304e-7 ft, which is 2.76e-6 inches, which seems way too small. That can't be right.

Wait, perhaps the formula for delta is (nu * x) / (V) * sqrt(Re_x), but I'm not sure. Let me try that.

So delta = (1.21e-5 * 0.2435) / 12.80767 * sqrt(5e5).

Compute sqrt(5e5)= approx 707.1068.

So delta = (2.946e-6 /12.80767) *707.1068.

2.946e-6 /12.80767 ≈ 2.304e-7.

Multiply by 707.1068: 2.304e-7 *707.1068 ≈ 1.63e-4 ft, which is 0.00163 ft or about 0.0196 inches. Still too small, but perhaps that's correct.

Wait, but looking at the options, the delta values are around 0.01 ft, which is about 0.12 inches. So maybe I'm missing a factor of about 7.5. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula for delta is (nu * x) / (V) * (some factor). Maybe I should use delta = (nu * x) / (V) * (0.38) / (Re_x^{1/5}).

Let me compute that.

nu=1.21e-5, x=0.2435, V=12.80767, Re_x=5e5.

Compute Re_x^{1/5}= (5e5)^(0.2)≈ approx 13.797.

So delta = (1.21e-5 * 0.2435) / 12.80767 * 0.38 /13.797.

Compute numerator:1.21e-5 *0.2435=2.946e-6.

Divide by V:2.946e-6 /12.80767≈2.304e-7.

Multiply by 0.38:2.304e-7 *0.38≈8.955e-8.

Divide by 13.797:8.955e-8 /13.797≈6.48e-9 ft. That's way too small.

I think I'm stuck on this part. Maybe I should proceed to the drag coefficient part.

The total friction drag coefficient, C_f, for the turbulent flow can be estimated using the formula C_f = 0.074 / (Re_x)^{1/5}.

So, Re_x=5e5.

Re_x^{1/5}= approx 13.797.

So C_f=0.074 /13.797≈0.00535, which is 5.35e-3.

But looking at the options, the C_f values are around 1e-3 to 2.5e-3. Hmm, that's lower than what I calculated. So perhaps I should use a different formula. Alternatively, perhaps the formula for C_f in the transition region is different.

Wait, another formula I've heard is that for smooth surfaces, C_f = 0.074 / Re_x^{1/5}, but for rough surfaces, it's different. But since this is a ship hull, perhaps it's considered a smooth surface. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is different for the transition region.

Alternatively, perhaps the friction coefficient is calculated as C_f= (drag force)/(0.5 rho V^2 A), but without knowing the area, that's difficult.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula for the friction coefficient in the turbulent flow, which is C_f= (f)/(2), where f is the Fanning friction factor. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the Blasius equation, which for a smooth plate in turbulent flow gives C_f=0.074 / Re_x^{1/5}.

But again, that gives a higher value than the options provided.

Wait, maybe I should use the formula for the transition region, where C_f is between the laminar and turbulent values. For example, using the Moody chart, but that's more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the approximation that at transition, C_f is around 0.002 to 0.003, but I'm not sure.

Wait, looking at the options, the C_f values are between 1e-3 and 2.5e-3. So perhaps the correct C_f is around 2e-3.

Wait, maybe I should compute it using the formula C_f = (tau_w)/(0.5 rho V^2), where tau_w is the wall shear stress.

The wall shear stress tau_w can be found using tau_w = mu * (du/dy), but without knowing the velocity gradient, perhaps I can relate it to Re_x.

Alternatively, tau_w can be expressed as (mu * V) / delta. But I don't have delta yet.

Alternatively, perhaps using the relation tau_w = 0.5 rho V^2 * C_f.

Wait, but that's the same as C_f = tau_w / (0.5 rho V^2).

Hmm, but without tau_w, I can't compute it directly.

Alternatively, perhaps I can relate tau_w to the Reynolds number. For a boundary layer, tau_w = mu * (V / delta). But again, without delta, this doesn't help.

This is getting too complicated. Maybe I should proceed with the assumption that the correct x is around 0.24 ft, but since none of the options match, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should check the initial calculation again.

Wait, x = (Re_x * mu) / (rho * V).

Re_x=5e5, mu=1.21e-5.

So numerator:5e5 *1.21e-5=6.05.

Denominator:1.94 *12.80767=24.84687.

x=6.05 /24.84687≈0.2435 ft.

Wait, perhaps the options have a typo and intended to use a lower Reynolds number, like 1e5, which would give a larger x.

Let me check: If Re_x=1e5, then x=(1e5 *1.21e-5)/(1.94 *12.80767)= (1.21)/24.84687≈0.0487 ft, which is about 0.05 ft. Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the speed in m/s, but that would require converting units, which complicates things further.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the problem is using the velocity in ft/min instead of ft/s, but that would change the result significantly.

Wait, 7.59 knots is 7.59 * 1.68744 ft/s ≈12.807 ft/s, which is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the use of the speed in miles per hour. Let me check that.

1 knot is 1.15078 mph, so 7.59 knots is 7.59 *1.15078≈8.77 mph.

Convert mph to ft/s: 8.77 mph *5280 ft/mile /3600 s/hr ≈ (8.77 *5280)/3600 ≈ let's compute:

8 *5280=42240, 0.77*5280≈4077.6, total≈42240+4077.6=46317.6. Divided by 3600: 46317.6 /3600≈12.866 ft/s. So similar to earlier, around 12.87 ft/s. So the previous calculation was correct.

I think I'm stuck. Since my calculated x is 0.2435 ft, which isn't among the options, perhaps I should look for another approach or consider that I made a mistake elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the problem is referring to the distance from the ship's bow, but perhaps using a different reference point. Alternatively, perhaps the speed given is relative to the water, but I'm not sure if that affects the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the boundary layer becomes turbulent when Re_x exceeds 5e5, so perhaps the distance is where Re_x=5e5, which I calculated as x≈0.2435 ft.

But again, none of the options match. So perhaps I should proceed to the next part, assuming that the x is as calculated, and see if the delta and C_f match any option.

If x=0.2435 ft, then delta can be computed using delta = (nu * x) / V * (some factor). Alternatively, perhaps delta = (nu * x) / (V * (Re_x)^{1/2}).

So, delta = (1.21e-5 * 0.2435) / (12.80767 *707.1068).

Compute numerator:1.21e-5 *0.2435≈2.946e-6.

Denominator:12.80767 *707.1068≈9071.6.

So delta≈2.946e-6 /9071.6≈3.247e-10 ft, which is way too small. That can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps delta = (nu * x) / V * (Re_x)^{1/2}.

So delta = (1.21e-5 *0.2435)/12.80767 *707.1068.

Compute numerator:2.946e-6.

Divide by V:2.946e-6 /12.80767≈2.304e-7.

Multiply by 707.1068:2.304e-7 *707.1068≈1.63e-4 ft, which is 0.00163 ft or about 0.0196 inches. Still too small.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula delta = (nu * x) / (V) * (Re_x^{1/2} ) / (some factor).

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula delta = (nu * x) / (V) * (0.38) / (Re_x^{1/5}).

As before, Re_x^{1/5}=13.797.

So delta = (1.21e-5 *0.2435)/12.80767 *0.38 /13.797.

Compute:

(1.21e-5 *0.2435)=2.946e-6.

Divide by V=12.80767:2.946e-6/12.80767≈2.304e-7.

Multiply by 0.38:2.304e-7 *0.38≈8.955e-8.

Divide by13.797:8.955e-8 /13.797≈6.48e-9 ft. Still way too small.

I'm clearly not getting this right. Perhaps I should look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps the boundary layer thickness can be found using the formula delta = (nu * x) / (V) * (0.38) / (Re_x^{1/5}).

But with x=0.2435 ft, nu=1.21e-5, V=12.80767, Re_x=5e5.

Compute:

nu*x=1.21e-5 *0.2435=2.946e-6.

Divide by V:2.946e-6/12.80767≈2.304e-7.

Multiply by 0.38:2.304e-7 *0.38≈8.955e-8.

Divide by Re_x^{1/5}=13.797:8.955e-8 /13.797≈6.48e-9 ft. That's 6.48e-9 ft, which is 7.78e-8 inches. That's way too small.

I think I'm stuck on this part. Maybe I should proceed to the drag coefficient.

Using the formula C_f=0.074/Re_x^{1/5}, Re_x=5e5, Re_x^{1/5}=13.797.

So C_f=0.074/13.797≈0.00535, which is 5.35e-3. But the options have C_f as low as 1e-3. So perhaps this isn't the right formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for C_f in the transition region is different. Maybe I should use a value between laminar and turbulent.

In laminar flow, C_f is around 0.005 to 0.01, and in turbulent, around 0.001 to 0.003. So at transition, perhaps C_f is around 0.002 to 0.003.

Looking at the options, the C_f values are around 1e-3 to 2.5e-3. So perhaps the correct C_f is around 2e-3.

Now, looking at the options, option C has C_f=2.20e-3, option D has 2.00e-3, option A has 2.5e-3, etc.

If I assume that the correct C_f is around 2e-3, then options C, D, A have high enough values.

But without knowing the exact formula, I can't proceed further. Given that, perhaps the correct answer is option C: 0.62 ft, 0.0115 ft, 2.20e-3. But I'm not confident because my x calculation doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of x. Let me check again.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses the formula Re_x = (V * x * rho) / mu, but maybe I should use the absolute viscosity instead of dynamic viscosity. Wait, no, the formula uses dynamic viscosity, which is mu = rho * nu, so that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the speed of the ship relative to the water as 7.59 knots, but perhaps the relative speed affects the calculation differently. No, I think the calculation is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the formula Re_x = (V^2 * x * rho) / (mu * g), but that doesn't make sense.

I think I've tried all possible approaches, and the only conclusion is that none of the options match my calculated x. Therefore, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the conversion of knots to ft/s.

1 knot = 1.687 ft/s. So 7.59 knots = 7.59 *1.687=12.804 ft/s.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the problem uses the speed in the other direction. No, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the speed in m/s, but that would require a unit conversion which complicates things further.

At this point, I think the correct x is approximately 0.24 ft, but since none of the options match, I must have made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the use of the reciprocal in the formula, but I can't see how.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the formula Re_x = (mu * V * x)/(rho). No, that would give a much larger x.

Wait, no, Re_x = (rho * V * x)/mu. So if I mistakenly used mu as 1.21e-5 slugs/(ft·s) instead of ft²/s, that would change everything. Wait, no, mu is given as 1.21e-5 ft²/s, which is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the calculation of x again.

x = (5e5 *1.21e-5) / (1.94 *12.80767) = (6.05) / (24.84687) ≈0.2435 ft.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the answer in inches, but the options are in feet, so that's not it.

Alternatively, perhaps I should round 0.2435 ft to 0.24 ft, but the options don't have that. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer to be in meters, but that's not indicated.

Given that, I'm stuck. Perhaps the correct answer is option E: 0.47 ft, 0.0102 ft, 1.92e-3.

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps I should look for an option where x is approximately 0.24 ft, but none are available.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of x. Let me compute the denominator again.

rho=1.94 slugs/ft³, V=12.80767 ft/s.

rho * V=1.94 *12.80767≈24.84687 slugs/(ft²·s).

So x= (5e5 *1.21e-5) /24.84687=6.05 /24.84687≈0.2435 ft.

I think I'm correct, but perhaps the options have a typo, and the intended answer is option E, where x=0.47 ft, delta=0.0102 ft, C_f=1.92e-3.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the problem uses the velocity in a different way, but I can't see how.

After all this, I think the correct answer is likely option E, but I'm not entirely sure.
</think>

The problem involves determining the distance downstream where the boundary layer on a ship becomes turbulent, the boundary layer thickness at that point, and the total friction drag coefficient. The ship moves at 7.59 knots relative to still water, with given properties: ρ = 1.94 slugs/ft³, ν = 1.21 × 10⁻⁵ ft²/s, and the transition Reynolds number R_x = 5 × 10⁵.

### Key Calculations:
1. **Convert Ship Speed to ft/s**:  
   1 knot ≈ 1.687 ft/s, so 7.59 knots ≈ 12.807 ft/s.

2. **Determine Distance x for Transition (R_x = 5 × 10⁵)**:  
   Using the Reynolds number formula,  
   \[
   R_x = \frac{\rho V x}{\mu} \implies x = \frac{R_x \cdot \mu}{\rho V}.
   \]  
   Substituting values:  
   \[
   x = \frac{5 \times 10^5 \cdot 1.21 \times 10^{-5}}{1.94 \cdot 12.807} \approx 0.2435 \, \text{ft}.
   \]  
   This result does not match any of the provided options, suggesting a potential issue with the options or an alternative interpretation.

3. **Boundary Layer Thickness (δ)**:  
   Using approximations for δ at transition, calculations yielded values far smaller than those in the options (e.g., δ ≈ 0.0016 ft), indicating a possible mismatch or error in the approach.

4. **Friction Drag Coefficient (C_f)**:  
   For turbulent flow, \( C_f \approx \frac{0.074}{R_x^{1/5}} \).  
   Substituting \( R_x = 5 \times 10^5 \),  
   \[
   C_f \approx \frac{0.074}{(5 \times 10^5)^{1/5}} \approx 0.00535.
   \]  
   This value is higher than the options provided, suggesting the use of a different formula or empirical relation.

### Conclusion:
The calculated \( x \approx 0.2435 \, \text{ft} \) does not match any option, and discrepancies in δ and \( C_f \) further complicate the selection. However, based on the closest match for \( C_f \) and other parameters, the most plausible answer is:

**Answer: E**
