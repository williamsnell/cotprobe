Answer:
    
<think>
Okay, so I've got this problem about a shunt motor, and I need to find the speed at half load and at 125% overload. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on motor calculations, but let me try to think this through step by step.

First, I remember that shunt motors have separate excitation for the field and the armature. The speed of a shunt motor is given by the formula:

Speed (N) = (V - Ia * Ra) / (Φ * A) * 60π

Wait, maybe I should write it more clearly. Oh right, the formula is:

N = (V - Ia * Ra) / (Φ * (P/2)) ) * 60

Wait, no, perhaps another approach. Let me recall. The speed equation for a shunt motor is:

N = (V - Ia * Ra) / (Φ * (P/2)) ) * 60

But wait, I think another way to write it is:

N = (V - Ia * Ra) / (Φ * (P/2)) ) * 60 / π ?

Wait, maybe I should start from the basics. The speed of a shunt motor is given by:

N = (V - Ia * Ra) / (Φ * (P/2)) ) * (60 / (2π)) * 60 ?

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The correct formula for the speed of a shunt motor is:

N = (V - Ia * Ra) / (Φ * (P/2)) ) * (60 / π )

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to use the formula:

N = (V - Ia * Ra) / (Φ * A) ) * (60 / (2π)) )

Wait, maybe I should write it as:

N = (V - Ia * Ra) / (K) ), where K is the field flux and armature reaction effects. Wait, no, perhaps a better approach is to use the formula that relates speed to voltage, current, and resistance.

Another approach is to use the formula for speed:

N = (V - Ia * Ra) / (Φ * (P/2)) ) * (60 / (2π)) )

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula where speed is inversely proportional to the armature current. Wait, no, that's for series motors. Shunt motors have speed that depends on the voltage and the current in the armature.

Wait, I think the correct formula for the speed of a shunt motor is:

N = (V - Ia * Ra) / (Φ * (P/2)) ) * (60 / (2π)) )

But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe another way. Let me think about the back EMF equation. The back EMF E = V - Ia * Ra. And the back EMF is also equal to (Φ * P * N) / (60 * A), where A is the number of parallel paths, which for a shunt motor is usually 1 or 2, depending on the construction.

Wait, for a shunt motor, the armature has A parallel paths, and the field is in parallel with the armature. So the number of parallel paths in the armature is A, which is typically 1 or 2. For a four-pole motor, P=4, and A=2. So the formula for back EMF E is:

E = (Φ * P * N) / (60 * A)

So rearranging, N = (E * 60 * A) / (Φ * P )

But E is equal to V - Ia * Ra, so substituting:

N = ( (V - Ia * Ra) * 60 * A ) / (Φ * P )

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck with the exact formula, but perhaps I can find the speed variation based on load changes.

At full load, the speed is 1800 rpm. The question asks for the speed at half load and at 125% overload.

But wait, in a shunt motor, the speed is primarily determined by the voltage and the flux. Since it's a shunt motor, the field current If is constant because the field resistance is high (60 ohms), and the armature current varies with load.

Wait, no. Actually, in a shunt motor, the field is connected in parallel, so the field current If is (V - V Brushes) / Rf. Wait, but the brushes have a voltage drop, so the actual voltage across the field is V - V_brush.

Wait, the brush voltage drop is given as 3 V. So the field current If = (V - V_brush) / Rf. So at full load, V is 120 V. So If = (120 - 3) / 60 = 117 / 60 = 1.95 A.

So the flux Φ is proportional to If, so Φ = K * If, where K is a constant.

Now, the armature current Ia at full load is given as 40 A. So the armature voltage drop is Ia * Ra = 40 * 0.2 = 8 V.

So the back EMF E = V - Ia * Ra - V_brush? Wait, no, the brush drop is part of the armature circuit. So the armature voltage is V - V_brush, so E = (V - V_brush) - Ia * Ra.

Wait, no, the brushes are part of the external circuit, so the armature's voltage is V - V_brush. So the back EMF is E = (V - V_brush) - Ia * Ra.

So E = (120 - 3) - 40 * 0.2 = 117 - 8 = 109 V.

But wait, maybe that's correct. So at full load, E = 109 V.

Now, the speed at full load is 1800 rpm. Let's use that to find the constant in the speed equation.

The speed N is proportional to E / Φ, because in the speed equation, E = (Φ * P * N) / (60 * A). So N = (E * 60 * A) / (Φ * P )

But since Φ is proportional to If, and If is (V - V_brush)/Rf, which is 117/60 = 1.95 A. So Φ = K * If, where K is some constant.

Wait, but the speed equation can be written as N = (E) / (K * If * (P/(2A))) ), but perhaps it's easier to consider the speed variation with load.

In a shunt motor, the speed is given by:

N ∝ (V - Ia * Ra) / (If )

But since If is (V - V_brush)/Rf, and V is constant (assuming line voltage is constant), If is almost constant unless the armature reaction affects it. But in this problem, we can assume that If is constant because Rf is much higher than Ra, so If doesn't change much with Ia.

Wait, but in reality, the flux might decrease slightly with increasing Ia due to armature reaction, but the problem doesn't mention that, so perhaps we can assume that Φ is constant.

Wait, no, because the field current If is (V - V_brush)/Rf, and V is the line voltage, which is constant. So If is constant, approximately 1.95 A, as calculated before.

So if Φ is constant, then the speed N is proportional to (V - Ia * Ra) / V_total, where V_total is the total voltage in the armature circuit, which is V - V_brush.

Wait, no, because E = (V - V_brush) - Ia * Ra.

So, E = (120 - 3) - Ia * 0.2 = 117 - 0.2 Ia.

Since Φ is constant, the speed N is proportional to E, because N = (E * 60 * A) / (Φ * P ). If Φ and A and P are constants, then N ∝ E, which is (117 - 0.2 Ia).

So when the load decreases, the armature current Ia decreases, which increases E, thus increasing speed.

At full load, Ia is 40 A, so E is 117 - 8 = 109 V, and N is 1800 rpm.

Now, we need to find the speed at half load and at 125% load.

Wait, but wait, in a shunt motor, the torque is proportional to the flux times the armature current. Since torque T is proportional to Φ * Ia, and the speed is inversely proportional to torque (for a given power). So as the load increases, Ia increases, but speed decreases.

Wait, but the speed is proportional to E, which is (V - V_brush) - Ia Ra. So as Ia increases, E decreases, leading to lower speed.

So, for part (a), the speed at half load. At half load, the armature current Ia would be half of full load? Wait, no, that's not correct. In a motor, the current doesn't necessarily halve just because the torque is halved. It depends on the load characteristics.

Wait, perhaps for a linear load, like a resistive load, the current would be proportional to the torque, which is proportional to the load. But in practice, the relationship might not be linear, but perhaps for this problem, we can assume that the current at half load is half of the full load current, 20 A.

Wait, but that might not be accurate. Alternatively, perhaps we should think in terms of torque. The torque T is proportional to Φ * Ia, and since Φ is constant, T ∝ Ia. At full load, T = T_full at Ia=40 A. At half load, T = T_half = 0.5 T_full, so Ia would be 20 A.

But is that correct? Because in a motor, the torque is proportional to the armature current, assuming flux is constant. So yes, if the torque is halved, the current would be halved.

But wait, no, because the torque is proportional to Ia, so for half torque, Ia would be half. So Ia_half = 20 A.

So then, E_half = 117 - 0.2 * 20 = 117 - 4 = 113 V.

The speed N is proportional to E, so since at full load E=109 V, N=1800 rpm.

So the ratio of E at half load to E at full load is 113 / 109 ≈ 1.0367.

So the speed at half load would be 1800 * 1.0367 ≈ 1866 rpm.

Wait, but looking at the options, none of them have 1866. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the speed using the formula more accurately.

Let me set up the equation. Since N ∝ E, and E = 117 - 0.2 Ia.

At full load, Ia=40 A, E=109 V, N=1800 rpm.

So the constant of proportionality is K = N / E = 1800 / 109 ≈ 16.5138 rpm/V.

So at half load, Ia=20 A, E=117 - 4 = 113 V.

So N = K * E = 16.5138 * 113 ≈ 1867 rpm.

But looking at the options, the closest is option J: Half-load speed: 1840 rpm, 1(1/4) load speed: 1800 rpm. No, that's not close. Option C: Half 1900, which is higher. Option F: 1830, which is close but not exact.

Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating the Ia at half load. Alternatively, perhaps the assumption that Ia halves at half load is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the motor's torque is proportional to Ia, so at half load, the torque is half, so Ia is half. But perhaps the actual current isn't exactly half because the voltage drop in the armature resistance changes.

Wait, let me think again. The mechanical power output is P = T * ω. The electrical power input is V * Ia, but considering the voltage drop.

But perhaps a better approach is to use the fact that the speed is inversely proportional to the armature current when Φ is constant.

Wait, no, because E = V - Ia Ra, and N ∝ E, so N ∝ (V - Ia Ra). So N = (V - Ia Ra) / (some constant).

So the speed is directly proportional to (V - Ia Ra). So if Ia decreases, N increases.

At full load, Ia=40 A, N=1800 rpm.

At half load, Ia=Ia_half.

But how to find Ia_half? Well, the torque is proportional to Ia, so if the torque is halved, Ia is halved. So Ia_half=20 A.

So E_half = 117 - 0.2 * 20 = 117 - 4 = 113 V.

So N_half = (113 / 109) * 1800 ≈ 1.0367 * 1800 ≈ 1866 rpm.

But none of the options have this. The closest is option F: 1830 rpm, but that's lower. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in assuming that Ia is 20 A at half load. Perhaps the current doesn't drop linearly with load. Let me think differently.

The speed of the motor is given by:

N = (V - Ia Ra) / (Φ * (P/(2A))) ) * (60 / (2π)) )

But perhaps it's easier to use the formula for speed in terms of the back EMF.

Alternatively, I can use the formula that relates the speed to the load. Since the motor is a shunt motor, the flux is approximately constant, so the speed is inversely proportional to the armature current. Wait, no, because E = V - Ia Ra, so as Ia increases, E decreases, leading to lower speed.

Wait, perhaps another approach: the speed is given by:

N = (V - Ia Ra) / (Φ * (P/(2A))) ) * (60 / (2π)) )

But without knowing the number of poles P and the number of parallel paths A, I can't calculate it directly. But perhaps I can relate the speeds at different loads.

At full load, Ia = 40 A, N = 1800 rpm.

At half load, Ia = Ia_half.

Assuming that the torque is proportional to Ia, then at half load, Ia_half = 20 A.

So E_half = 117 - 0.2 * 20 = 113 V.

The ratio of E_half to E_full is 113/109 ≈ 1.0367.

So the speed at half load would be 1800 * 1.0367 ≈ 1866 rpm.

Looking at the options, none match exactly, but option J has half load at 1840 rpm, which is a bit lower. Option C has 1900, which is higher. Option F is 1830, which is a bit lower.

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the assumption that Ia is 20 A at half load. Alternatively, perhaps the current doesn't drop exactly to 20 A because the armature reaction changes the flux, but the problem says to assume Φ is constant.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the speed is given by N = (V - Ia Ra) / (Φ * (P/(2A))) ) * (60/(2π)) )

But without knowing P and A, perhaps I can relate the speeds using the fact that Φ is constant.

Let me denote the speed at any load as N = k (V - Ia Ra), where k is a constant that includes all other factors.

At full load, N1 = k (V - Ia1 Ra) = 1800 rpm.

At half load, N2 = k (V - Ia2 Ra).

We need to find Ia2.

But how?

The torque T is proportional to Ia, assuming Φ is constant. So T = K * Ia, where K is a constant.

At full load, T1 = K * Ia1.

At half load, T2 = K * Ia2.

If the load torque is halved, T2 = 0.5 T1, so Ia2 = 0.5 Ia1 = 20 A.

So N2 = k (V - Ia2 Ra) = k (117 - 4) = k * 113.

But k = 1800 / (V - Ia1 Ra) = 1800 / 109.

So N2 = (1800 / 109) * 113 ≈ (1800 * 113) / 109 ≈ 1800 * 1.0367 ≈ 1866 rpm.

But again, none of the options match this. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the speed at an overload of 125%, which is part (b), but I'm getting stuck on part (a).

Alternatively, perhaps the current doesn't drop to 20 A at half load because the voltage drop in the armature resistance is less. Wait, but Ia is 40 A at full load, which gives a drop of 8 V. At half load, 20 A would drop 4 V, so E would be 117 -4=113 V, leading to higher speed.

But perhaps the problem expects me to ignore the armature reaction and just calculate based on voltage and current.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the speed at different loads using the formula N = (V - Ia Ra) / (Φ * (P/(2A))) ) * (60/(2π)) )

But without knowing P and A, perhaps I can only find the ratio.

Wait, another approach: since Φ is constant, the speed is inversely proportional to the armature current.

Wait, no, because N is proportional to E, which is (V - Ia Ra). So if Ia decreases, E increases, leading to higher N.

So, let's calculate the speed for part (a) and (b).

At full load:

Ia1 = 40 A.

E1 = 117 - 40*0.2 = 117 -8=109 V.

N1=1800 rpm.

At half load:

Assuming Ia2=20 A.

E2=117-4=113 V.

So N2= (E2/E1)*N1= (113/109)*1800 ≈ 1.0367 *1800≈1866 rpm.

But looking at the options, the closest is option J: 1840 rpm, which is lower than 1866. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the question expects us to consider the field current If, which is (V - V_brush)/Rf = 117/60=1.95 A. The flux Φ=K * If.

But as the armature current Ia increases, the armature reaction may cause the flux to decrease, but the problem doesn't mention that, so perhaps we can ignore it.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to consider the speed variation due to changes in Ia and Φ.

But without knowing the exact formula, perhaps I should look for another way.

Wait, another formula for shunt motor speed is:

N = (V - Ia Ra) / (Φ * (P/(2A))) ) * (60/(2π)) )

But without knowing P and A, perhaps I can't proceed numerically.

Alternatively, perhaps the speed variation can be expressed as N ∝ (V - Ia Ra) / (Φ).

Since Φ is If * some factor, and If is (V - V_brush)/Rf.

But since V is constant, If is constant, so Φ is constant.

So N ∝ (V - Ia Ra).

So, the speed is directly proportional to (V - Ia Ra).

At full load, Ia=40 A, so V-Ia Ra=117-8=109 V, N=1800 rpm.

At half load, Ia=20 A, V-Ia Ra=117-4=113 V.

So N = (113/109)*1800 ≈ 1866 rpm.

But the options don't have this. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something about the field current. The field current If = (V - V_brush)/Rf = 117/60=1.95 A.

At full load, the field current is 1.95 A, so Φ is proportional to that.

At overload, Ia increases, but If remains the same because V and Rf are constant.

So, for part (b), 125% overload means Ia=50 A.

So E=117 -50*0.2=117-10=107 V.

So N= (107/109)*1800 ≈ 0.98165 *1800≈1767 rpm.

But looking at the options, part (b) is the speed at 125% load. Let's see which options have 1767 rpm for part (b).

Looking at the options:

Option F: 1(1/4) load speed: 1775 rpm.

Option G: 1765.

Option H: 1740.

Option I: 1700.

Option J: 1800.

None match exactly. The closest is option F at 1775, which is close to 1767.

But wait, perhaps I should recheck the calculations.

Wait, for part (b), the current is 125% of full load, so Ia=50 A.

E=117 -50*0.2=117-10=107 V.

N= (107/109)*1800 ≈ (0.98165)*1800≈1767 rpm.

Looking at the options, the closest is option F: 1775 rpm.

But let's see which options have (a) and (b) matching.

Looking at the options:

Option F: (a) Half-load: 1830 rpm, (b) 1775 rpm.

Option J: (a) 1840, (b) 1800.

Option E: (a)1750, (b)1825.

Option H: (a)1820, (b)1740.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in part (a). Maybe I should consider that the current at half load isn't exactly 20 A.

Wait, another approach: the speed is given by N = (V - Ia Ra) / (Φ * (P/(2A))) ) * (60/(2π)) )

But without knowing P and A, perhaps I can relate the speeds using the ratio.

At full load, N1=1800 rpm, Ia1=40 A.

At half load, Ia2=Ia_half.

Assuming that the load torque is halved, so T2=0.5 T1.

Since T ∝ Ia (assuming Φ constant), Ia2=0.5 Ia1=20 A.

So E2=117 -4=113 V.

N2= (113/109)*1800≈1866 rpm.

But none of the options match. So perhaps the correct answer isn't listed, but looking at the options, option J has half load at 1840, which is close to 1866.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the armature reaction causes the flux to decrease, but the problem doesn't mention that, so perhaps I should ignore it.

Wait, maybe the correct approach is to calculate the speed using the formula N = (V - Ia Ra) / (Φ * (P/(2A))) ) * (60/(2π)) )

But without knowing P and A, I can't proceed. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to assume that the speed is inversely proportional to the current, so N ∝ (V - Ia Ra).

Wait, perhaps I can calculate the speed ratio.

At full load: V-Ia Ra=109 V, N=1800 rpm.

At half load: V-Ia Ra=113 V, so N= (113/109)*1800≈1866 rpm.

But that's not an option. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating E. Let me recheck.

At full load, Ia=40 A, Ra=0.2 ohm.

So Ia Ra=8 V.

V=120 V, brush drop=3 V, so V across armature is 117 V.

So E=117 -8=109 V.

At half load, Ia=20 A, Ia Ra=4 V, E=117-4=113 V.

So N= (113/109)*1800≈1866 rpm.

But none of the options have this.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the brush voltage drop when calculating E. Let me try that.

If we ignore the brush drop, then E=V - Ia Ra.

So at full load, E=120 -8=112 V, N=1800 rpm.

At half load, E=120-4=116 V.

So N= (116/112)*1800≈1.0357*1800≈1864 rpm.

Still not matching any options.

Alternatively, perhaps the brush drop is 3 V per brush, so total drop is 6 V. Wait, but the problem says brush volt drop is 3 V. I think it refers to the total drop across both brushes, so 3 V in total, not per brush.

So I think I did it correctly before.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me look at the options again.

The options for part (a) are:

A: 1870

B:1780

C:1900

D:1800

E:1750

F:1830

G:1860

H:1820

I:1700

J:1840

My calculation gives 1866, closest to option G: 1860, but it's not exact. Alternatively, maybe the intended answer is option J: 1840 rpm.

Wait, perhaps the current at half load isn't 20 A. Maybe the current doesn't drop to 20 A because the load isn't linear, or perhaps the problem expects a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the speed is inversely proportional to the current, so N ∝ (V - Ia Ra).

Wait, but that's what I did.

Hmm, perhaps I should proceed to part (b) to see which option fits both (a) and (b).

For part (b), 125% overload means Ia=50 A.

E=117 -50*0.2=117-10=107 V.

N= (107/109)*1800≈1767 rpm.

Looking at the options for part (b):

Option F: 1775 rpm.

Option G:1765.

Option I:1700.

So the closest is option G:1765, but the exact calculation is 1767.

Looking at the options, option F has part (b) at 1775 rpm, which is close but not exact.

But let's see which overall option has both (a) and (b) matching.

Looking at option F: (a)1830, (b)1775.

My calculations give (a)=1866, (b)=1767.

No option matches exactly. Perhaps the intended answer is option J: (a)1840, (b)1800.

But 1800 rpm for part (b) is the same as full load, which can't be right because overload should reduce speed.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the speed is inversely proportional to the current, but that's only true for series motors. For shunt motors, it's more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the speed is given by:

N = (V - Ia Ra) / (K * Ia)

Where K is a constant that includes Φ and other factors.

Wait, that would make N = (V - Ia Ra) / (K Ia) = [V/(K Ia)] - Ra/K.

But that seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps another approach: the speed is given by:

N = (V - Ia Ra) / (Φ * (P/(2A))) ) * (60/(2π)) )

But without knowing P and A, I can't compute it. Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes P=4 and A=2, which are common for a 120 V motor.

Let me assume P=4 poles and A=2 parallel paths.

Then, the formula becomes:

N = (V - Ia Ra) / (Φ * (4/(2*2))) ) * (60/(2π)) )

Simplify denominator: 4/(2*2)=1.

So N = (V - Ia Ra) / Φ * (60/(2π)) )

But 60/(2π) ≈9.5493.

So N = (V - Ia Ra) * 9.5493 / Φ.

But Φ = If * something. Wait, Φ is the flux per pole, which is given by Φ = (V - V_brush) * (1/(Rf + ... )).

Wait, perhaps I should calculate Φ using the full load condition.

At full load, Ia=40 A, V=120 V, V_brush=3 V.

So V_armature = V - V_brush = 117 V.

The armature current Ia=40 A, so the armature voltage drop is Ia * Ra = 40 * 0.2 =8 V.

So back EMF E = V_armature - Ia Ra = 117-8=109 V.

E is also equal to (Φ * P * N) / (60 * A).

So 109 = (Φ * 4 * 1800) / (60 * 2 )

Simplify denominator: 60*2=120.

So 109 = (Φ *4 *1800)/120.

Simplify numerator:4*1800=7200.

So 109 = (7200 Φ)/120 → 7200/120=60.

So 109=60 Φ → Φ=109/60 ≈1.8167 Wb per pole.

Now, at half load, Ia=20 A.

E_half=117 -20 *0.2=117-4=113 V.

Using the same formula:

N = (E * 60 * A) / (Φ * P )

Plugging in the numbers:

N = (113 * 60 * 2) / (1.8167 *4 )

Calculate numerator: 113 *60=6780; 6780 *2=13560.

Denominator:1.8167 *4≈7.2668.

So N≈13560 /7.2668≈1866 rpm.

Again, same result. So the correct speed at half load is approximately 1866 rpm, which isn't an option. The closest is option G:1860.

But looking at the options, option G is (a)1860, (b)1765.

For part (b), Ia=50 A.

E=117-50*0.2=117-10=107 V.

N= (107 *60 *2)/(1.8167 *4)= (107 *60 *2)=12840; denominator=7.2668.

12840 /7.2668≈1767 rpm.

So option G's part (b) is 1765, which is very close.

So the correct answer would be (a)1860, (b)1765, which is option G.

But wait, looking back at the options, option G says:

G: Half-load speed: 1860 rpm, 1(1/4) load speed: 1765 rpm.

Yes, that matches our calculations.

To determine the speed of the shunt motor at half load and at 125% overload, we analyze the given parameters and apply the principles of motor operation.

### Key Parameters:
- **Voltage (V):** 120 V
- **Armature resistance (Ra):** 0.2 Ω
- **Field resistance (Rf):** 60 Ω
- **Brush voltage drop:** 3 V
- **Full load current (Ia₁):** 40 A
- **Full load speed (N₁):** 1800 rpm

### Full Load Analysis:
At full load:
- **Field current (If):**  
  \[
  I_f = \frac{V - \text{Brush drop}}{R_f} = \frac{120 - 3}{60} = 1.95 \, \text{A}
  \]
- **Flux (Φ):**  
  \[
  \Phi = K \cdot I_f \quad \text{(where \(K\) is a constant)}
  \]
- **Armature voltage drop:**  
  \[
  I_a \cdot R_a = 40 \cdot 0.2 = 8 \, \text{V}
  \]
- **Back EMF (E):**  
  \[
  E = (V - \text{Brush drop}) - I_a \cdot R_a = 117 - 8 = 109 \, \text{V}
  \]

### Speed Formula:
The speed of a shunt motor is given by:  
\[
N = \frac{E \cdot 60 \cdot A}{\Phi \cdot P}
\]
where \(A\) is the number of parallel paths and \(P\) is the number of poles. Assuming \(A = 2\) and \(P = 4\) (common for a 120 V motor), the speed simplifies to:  
\[
N = \frac{E \cdot 9.5493}{\Phi}
\]

At full load:  
\[
\Phi = \frac{E \cdot 60 \cdot A}{N \cdot P} = \frac{109 \cdot 60 \cdot 2}{1800 \cdot 4} = 1.8167 \, \text{Wb/pole}
\]

### (a) Speed at Half Load:
At half load:
- **Armature current (Ia₂):**  
  Since torque \(T \propto I_a\), at half load, \(I_a = 20 \, \text{A}\).
- **Back EMF (E₂):**  
  \[
  E₂ = (V - \text{Brush drop}) - I_a \cdot R_a = 117 - 4 = 113 \, \text{V}
  \]
- **Speed (N₂):**  
  \[
  N₂ = \frac{E₂ \cdot 9.5493}{\Phi} = \frac{113 \cdot 9.5493}{1.8167} \approx 1866 \, \text{rpm}
  \]

The closest option for half load is **1860 rpm**.

### (b) Speed at 125% Overload:
At 125% overload:
- **Armature current (Ia₃):**  
  \[
  I_a = 1.25 \cdot 40 = 50 \, \text{A}
  \]
- **Back EMF (E₃):**  
  \[
  E₃ = (V - \text{Brush drop}) - I_a \cdot R_a = 117 - 10 = 107 \, \text{V}
  \]
- **Speed (N₃):**  
  \[
  N₃ = \frac{E₃ \cdot 9.5493}{\Phi} = \frac{107 \cdot 9.5493}{1.8167} \approx 1767 \, \text{rpm}
  \]

The closest option for 125% overload is **1765 rpm**.

### Final Answer:
The correct option is **G**:  
- Half-load speed: 1860 rpm  
- 125% load speed: 1765 rpm  

**Answer: G**
