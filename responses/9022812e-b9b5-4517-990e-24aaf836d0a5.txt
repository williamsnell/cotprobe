Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about refrigerators and freezers, and I need to figure out by what factor it's more expensive to extract the same amount of heat from the freezer compared to the refrigerator. Hmm, let me think.

Alright, the problem says the refrigerator is at 36°F, the freezer at 0.00°F, and the room temperature is 65°F. I remember that refrigerators and heat pumps work based on the Carnot cycle, and their efficiency is related to the temperatures involved. Oh right, the theoretical limit for a reversible refrigerator (or heat pump) is given by the Carnot efficiency.

Wait, so the question is about the cost factor, which relates to how much work is required to move the heat. The more work needed, the more expensive it is. So I think I need to compare the coefficients of performance (COP) for both the refrigerator and the freezer when extracting heat.

Wait, no, wait. The COP for a refrigerator is the heat extracted divided by the work input. For a Carnot refrigerator, the COP is Tc/(Th - Tc), where Tc is the cold temperature and Th is the hot temperature (room temperature in this case).

So let me write down the temperatures in Kelvin because the formulas use absolute temperatures. To convert Fahrenheit to Kelvin, I think the formula is K = (F + 459.67) * 5/9. Let me calculate each:

Room temperature (Th): 65°F. So Th = (65 + 459.67) * 5/9. Let me compute that. 65+459.67 is 524.67. Multiply by 5 is 2623.35, divided by 9 is about 291.48 K.

Refrigerator temperature (Tc1): 36°F. So Tc1 = (36 + 459.67) *5/9. 36+459.67 is 495.67. Multiply by 5 is 2478.35, divided by 9 is 275.37 K.

Freezer temperature (Tc2): 0°F. So Tc2 = (0 + 459.67) *5/9. That's 459.67 *5=2298.35, divided by 9 is approximately 255.37 K.

Wait, those Kelvin values look right. Now, for a Carnot refrigerator, the COP is Tc/(Th - Tc). So for the refrigerator (36°F), COP_refrigerator = Tc1/(Th - Tc1) = 275.37 / (291.48 - 275.37). Let me compute the denominator: 291.48 - 275.37 is about 16.11 K. So COP_refrigerator = 275.37 / 16.11 ≈ 17.1.

Wait, that's high. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, wait. No, wait a minute, wait. Wait, no, I think I made a mistake. Because for a refrigerator, the COP is Tc/(Th - Tc). So for the refrigerator, Tc is 275.37 K, and Th is 291.48 K. So 275.37 / (291.48 - 275.37) = 275.37 / 16.11 ≈ 17.1.

Now for the freezer, which is at 0°F, so Tc2 is 255.37 K. The COP for the freezer (since it's extracting heat from a lower temperature) would be COP_freezer = Tc2/(Th - Tc2) = 255.37 / (291.48 - 255.37) = 255.37 / 36.11 ≈ 7.07.

Wait, but wait, the question is about the factor by which it's more expensive to extract the same amount of heat from the freezer compared to the refrigerator. So, if the COP is lower, that means for the same amount of heat extracted, more work is needed. So the factor would be COP_refrigerator / COP_freezer.

Wait, no. Let me think again. COP is heat extracted per work done. So COP = Qc / W. So if you have the same Q (same amount of heat), the work W needed would be Q / COP. So the work for the refrigerator is W_refrigerator = Q / COP_refrigerator. Similarly, W_freezer = Q / COP_freezer.

The factor is W_freezer / W_refrigerator = (Q/COP_freezer) / (Q/COP_refrigerator) ) = COP_refrigerator / COP_freezer.

So the factor is COP_refrigerator divided by COP_freezer. Let me compute that.

COP_refrigerator ≈17.1, COP_freezer≈7.07. So 17.1 / 7.07 ≈ 2.42. Hmm, looking at the options, there's F:2.4 and D:2.7, etc.

Wait, maybe I should recalculate more accurately to avoid approximation errors.

Let me redo the COPs more precisely.

First, converting temperatures accurately.

Th = 65°F to K:
(65 + 459.67) * 5/9 = (524.67) * 5/9 = 2623.35 /9 = 291.4833 K.

Tc1 (refrigerator): 36°F = (36 +459.67) *5/9 = (495.67)*5/9 = 2478.35 /9 = 275.3722 K.

Tc2 (freezer): 0°F = (0 +459.67)*5/9 = 459.67 *5/9 = 2298.35/9 ≈ 255.3722 K.

Now, COP_refrigerator = Tc1/(Th - Tc1) = 275.3722 / (291.4833 - 275.3722) = 275.3722 / 16.1111 ≈ 17.09.

COP_freezer = Tc2/(Th - Tc2) = 255.3722 / (291.4833 -255.3722) = 255.3722 / 36.1111 ≈ 7.07.

So the factor is 17.09 /7.07 ≈ 2.417, which is approximately 2.42. Looking at the options, option F is 2.4, which is the closest. So the factor is about 2.4 times more expensive to extract the same amount of heat from the freezer.

To determine the factor by which it is more expensive to extract the same amount of heat from the freezer compared to the refrigerator, we calculate the coefficients of performance (COP) for both using the Carnot cycle formula:  
\[
\text{COP} = \frac{T_c}{T_h - T_c}
\]  
where \(T_c\) is the temperature of the cold reservoir and \(T_h\) is the temperature of the hot reservoir (room temperature).

### Step 1: Convert Temperatures to Kelvin
- **Room temperature (\(T_h\))**: \(65^\circ \mathrm{F} = 291.48 \, \mathrm{K}\)
- **Refrigerator temperature (\(T_{c1}\))**: \(36^\circ \mathrm{F} = 275.37 \, \mathrm{K}\)
- **Freezer temperature (\(T_{c2}\))**: \(0.00^\circ \mathrm{F} = 255.37 \, \mathrm{K}\)

### Step 2: Calculate COP for the Refrigerator
\[
\text{COP}_{\text{refrigerator}} = \frac{T_{c1}}{T_h - T_{c1}} = \frac{275.37}{291.48 - 275.37} \approx 17.09
\]

### Step 3: Calculate COP for the Freezer
\[
\text{COP}_{\text{freezer}} = \frac{T_{c2}}{T_h - T_{c2}} = \frac{255.37}{291.48 - 255.37} \approx 7.07
\]

### Step 4: Determine the Factor
The factor is the ratio of the COPs:
\[
\text{Factor} = \frac{\text{COP}_{\text{refrigerator}}}{\text{COP}_{\text{freezer}}} = \frac{17.09}{7.07} \approx 2.42
\]

### Final Answer
The factor is approximately **2.4**, which corresponds to option **F**.
