Question:

Three years ago, Fred invested $10,000 in the shares of ABC Corp. Each year, the company distributed dividends to its shareholders. Each year, Fred received $100 in dividends. Note that since Fred received $100 in dividends each year, his total income is $300. Today, Fred sold his shares for $12,000. What is the holding period return of his investment?

Options:

A: 0.28
B: 0.15
C: 0.18
D: 0.40
E: 0.25
F: 0.30
G: 0.33
H: 0.10
I: 0.23
J: 0.20

Okay, so I need to figure out the holding period return for Fred's investment. Let me start by understanding what the holding period return (HPR) is. From what I remember, HPR is the total return on an investment over the period it's held, considering both capital gains and dividends received. It's usually calculated as the sum of all dividends received plus the capital gain (or loss) divided by the initial investment.

Fred invested $10,000 three years ago. Each year, he received $100 in dividends. So over three years, the total dividends would be 3 times $100, which is $300. That part seems straightforward.

He sold the shares today for $12,000. So his capital gain is the selling price minus the initial investment. That's $12,000 minus $10,000, which equals $2,000. 

Now, the total return is the sum of the dividends and the capital gain. So that's $300 + $2,000 = $2,300. 

To find the holding period return, I divide the total return by the initial investment. So that's $2,300 divided by $10,000. Let me do that calculation: 2300 / 10000 equals 0.23, which is 23%.

Looking at the options, I see option I is 0.23. So I think that's the correct answer. Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything.

Wait, another thought: sometimes HPR can be calculated in different ways, but I think in this case, since it's a simple three-year period, the approach I took is correct. Dividends are received each year, and the capital gain is the difference when he sold. So adding them and dividing by the initial investment gives the overall return.

The holding period return is calculated by adding the total dividends received ($300) to the capital gain ($2,000), which equals $2,300. Dividing this by the initial investment of $10,000 gives a 23% return.
