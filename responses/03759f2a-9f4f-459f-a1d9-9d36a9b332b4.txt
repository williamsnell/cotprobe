Okay, so I have this question about preparing a balance sheet for Silvertown Office Supplies. The user provided a bunch of financial items, and I need to figure out the total assets and choose the correct option from A to J. 

First, I'll try to recall what a balance sheet looks like. The balance sheet has two main sections: Assets and Liabilities. The total assets should equal the total liabilities plus total equity. So, I need to add up all the assets and then make sure the total liabilities plus equity match that number.

Looking at the given information:

- Cash: $3,390
- Notes Receivable: $2,905
- Accounts Receivable: $8,215
- Merchandise Inventory: $23,600
- Store Supplies: $720
- Store Fixtures: $2,895
- Furniture and Equipment: $5,600
- Notes Payable: $5,250
- Accounts Payable: $4,800

Wait, the question gives these items as individual accounts. So the assets are the non-current and current assets. Let me list out each asset and then sum them.

Starting with Cash: $3,390. That's a current asset.

Notes Receivable: $2,905. That's another current asset.

Accounts Receivable: $8,215. Current.

Merchandise Inventory: $23,600. Current.

Store Supplies: $720. That's part of the store's supplies.

Store Fixtures: $2,895. Also part of the store's fixtures.

Furniture and Equipment: $5,600. That's a fixed asset.

Notes Payable: $5,250. Liabilities.

Accounts Payable: $4,800. Liabilities.

So the assets are:

Cash ($3,390)
Notes Receivable ($2,905)
Accounts Receivable ($8,215)
Merchandise Inventory ($23,600)
Store Supplies ($720)
Store Fixtures ($2,895)
Furniture and Equipment ($5,600)

Wait, but I'm adding up all these. Let me add them step by step.

First, Cash is 3,390.

Add Notes Receivable: 3,390 + 2,905 = 6,295.

Add Accounts Receivable: 6,295 + 8,215 = 14,510.

Add Merchandise Inventory: 14,510 + 23,600 = 38,110.

Store Supplies: 38,110 + 720 = 38,830.

Store Fixtures: 38,830 + 2,895 = 41,725.

Furniture and Equipment: 41,725 + 5,600 = 47,325.

So the total assets are $47,325.

Now, checking the options, option H is 47,325. So that would be the right answer.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss any items. The question provided all the assets and liabilities as individual accounts, so I think I included them all. Let me just recount the numbers to check.

Another way: Add each asset.

3,390 (Cash)
+2,905 (Notes Receivable) = 6,295
+8,215 (A/R) = 14,510
+23,600 (Merch) = 38,110
+720 (Store Supplies) = 38,830
+2,895 (Store Fixtures) = 41,725
+5,600 (Furniture) = 47,325.

Yes, that's correct. Now, looking at the options: option H is 47,325. So the answer should be H.

To determine the total assets of Silvertown Office Supplies as of April 30, we sum all the current assets provided:

- **Cash**: $3,390  
- **Notes Receivable**: $2,905  
- **Accounts Receivable**: $8,215  
- **Merchandise Inventory**: $23,600  
- **Store Supplies**: $720  
- **Store Fixtures**: $2,895  
- **Furniture and Equipment**: $5,600  

Adding these together:

3,390 + 2,905 = 6,295  
6,295 + 8,215 = 14,510  
14,510 + 23,600 = 38,110  
38,110 + 720 = 38,830  
38,830 + 2,895 = 41,725  
41,725 + 5,600 = 47,325  

The total assets amount to $47,325. 

Comparing this with the options provided, the correct choice is **H: Total assets 47,325**.

Answer: H
