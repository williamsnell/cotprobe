Question:

A manufacturer of electric motors formerly produced motors that utilized as a coolant a chemical substancethat was later discovered to be highly toxic. During its manufacturing operations, the manufacturer negligentlyallowed quantities of this substance to leak into the soil. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) orderedthat the premises, now owned by an appliance repair shop, be decontaminated. This order, and the subsequent cleanup efforts, received a high level of attention in the local media. An employee of the appliance repair shop has sued the manufacturer in negligence for damages for emotionaldistress. The employee claims to have suffered the distress as a consequence of learning that she has beenexposed for five years, while employed by the appliance repair shop at the premises affected by the EPA order,to the toxic contamination that has existed there. Her complaint does not allege that her emotional distress issevere, that the manufacturer's conduct was extreme and outrageous, or that she has suffered any physicalconsequences. In that action the manufacturer has filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief maybe granted. What is the manufacturer's best argument in support of that motion?

Options:

A: The manufacturer cannot be held liable for negligence because the toxic substance was not known to be harmful at the time of the leakage.
B: The manufacturer cannot be held liable because the EPA is responsible for the decontamination process.
C: The employee cannot sue the manufacturer because she was not exposed to the toxic substance directly from the manufacturer.
D: The repair shop employee's emotional distress is not alleged to be severe.
E: The complaint does not allege that the manufacturer was aware of the toxicity of the substance at the time of the leakage.
F: The complaint does not allege that the manufacturer's conduct was extreme and outrageous.
G: The complaint does not allege that the employee suffered any financial loss due to the emotional distress.
H: The complaint does not allege that the repair shop employee suffered any physical consequences.
I: The repair shop employee's proper remedy is in a claim against the repair shop, the occupier of thepremises during the period of her alleged exposure.
J: The employee cannot sue the manufacturer because she was not employed by the manufacturer at the time of the exposure.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this legal question about negligence and emotional distress. Let's break it down step by step.

The scenario is that a manufacturer used a coolant that later turned out to be toxic. They negligently let it leak into the soil. Now, the EPA ordered the premises decontaminated. The premises are now owned by an appliance repair shop. An employee of the repair shop is suing the manufacturer for negligence, claiming emotional distress from learning she was exposed for five years while working there. Her lawsuit doesn't mention severe distress, extreme conduct, or physical consequences.

The manufacturer is moving to dismiss, so I need to find the best argument for why the claim shouldn't stand.

First, I remember that emotional distress claims usually require more than just knowing about a danger. There's the bystander rule, but that's when someone witnesses injury to another. Here, the employee isn't a bystander; she's the one exposed.

Then there's the direct threat theory. For that, the plaintiff must be in imminent danger of physical harm and suffer a physical injury. But in this case, she's not claiming physical harm, just emotional distress from knowing she was exposed.

I also recall that negligence for emotional distress often requires a showing that the distress was severe. But the complaint doesn't allege that. It just says she suffered emotional distress without specifying severity. So maybe that's a problem.

Looking at the options, option D says the distress isn't alleged to be severe. If that's a requirement, then the claim fails. But wait, isn't there a different standard for when you're directly threatened? Or does the lack of physical injury mean she needs to show severity?

Another angle: the manufacturer isn't liable for the repair shop's employees. The manufacturer's duty was to those who were on the premises when the negligence occurred. Since the repair shop bought the premises, maybe the manufacturer's liability doesn't extend to the repair shop's employees now. But I think premises liability can sometimes extend to ongoing contamination, but I'm not sure if that's the main issue here.

Option I says the employee should sue the repair shop. That might be a better argument because the manufacturer's liability could be cut off once the premises were sold. But the manufacturer's motion is about failure to state a claim, not about third-party liability.

Wait, the manufacturer's argument could be that the employee wasn't exposed to the toxic substance from them anymore because the premises were sold. So maybe the manufacturer isn't liable for subsequent exposures. But the employee was exposed while the repair shop was there, so the manufacturer's initial leakage caused ongoing contamination. But the manufacturer's duty would have been to prevent harm at the time of their negligence, not necessarily for future owners.

Another point: the manufacturer's motion might argue that the employee's emotional distress isn't compensable because she wasn't physically injured. But I think some jurisdictions allow emotional distress without physical injury if it's a result of a direct threat, but that might require more than just knowing about exposure.

Looking back, the complaint doesn't claim physical consequences, so maybe the manufacturer can argue that without physical harm, the claim fails. That would align with option H: the complaint doesn't allege physical consequences.

But wait, in some cases, emotional distress can be a standalone claim if it's severe enough. But since the complaint doesn't say it's severe, that might be the issue. So option D says the distress isn't severe, which could be a problem because many jurisdictions require some level of severity for emotional distress claims.

Alternatively, the manufacturer might argue that they aren't liable because the EPA is handling it, but that seems more like a defense of assumption of risk or governmental immunity, which might not apply here.

Option E says the manufacturer wasn't aware of the toxicity at the time. If they were negligent, they might not need to have known it was toxic, just that their actions were negligent. So that might not be a good argument.

So, putting it together, the main issues are whether the employee's emotional distress is compensable without physical harm and whether it's severe. Since the complaint lacks allegations of severity, that's a problem. Therefore, the manufacturer's best argument is that the emotional distress isn't severe, which is option D.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes, in toxic exposure cases, even without physical symptoms, emotional distress can be claimed if there's a risk of harm. But I think the lack of severity of the distress is a key point here. So, the manufacturer can say that without alleging severe distress, the claim doesn't hold.

Alternatively, maybe the employee's claim fails because she wasn't in imminent danger, but she was exposed over five years, which might be too remote. But the question doesn't mention that; it's more about the elements of the claim.

So, I think the best answer is either D or H. But D is about the severity, H is about physical consequences. Since the complaint doesn't allege physical consequences, H could also be a point. But the main issue in emotional distress is usually the severity. So, maybe D is the better answer.

Wait, no, in some jurisdictions, emotional distress doesn't require physical injury but does require that the distress be severe. So if the complaint doesn't say it's severe, the manufacturer can dismiss the claim on that basis. So, D is the correct option.

The manufacturer's best argument is that the employee's emotional distress is not alleged to be severe, which is a necessary element for recovery in negligence.
