Question:

A 20-year-old student at a state university enrolled in the university's R. O. T. C (Reserve Officers' Training Corps. ) program. As part of her R. O. T. C. training, the student was required to spend three weeks at a camp for Marine Corps. summer field exercises. While at the camp, the student was given a new synthetic helmet to wear during her basic training. An agency purchased the new high-technology helmets for the Army and Marine Corps. to replace the old "steel pot" headgear worn for decades by U. S. soldiers. These new synthetic helmets were manufactured by a corporation and were made of Kevlar, an extremely tough fiber material with high energy-absorbing qualities that made it stronger in some ways than steel. When the student received her helmet from the Marine Corps. , it was packaged in the original carton supplied by the corporation. On the box, there was a picture that depicted an off-duty marine wearing the helmet while riding a bicycle. One afternoon after training, the student decided to take a ride on her bicycle. Believing that it could be used as a bicycle helmet, the student decided to use it for that purpose. During the ride, the student hit a deep pothole that caused her to be thrown headfirst from the bicycle. As she was flying through the air, the strap from her helmet came loose, and the helmet fell off her head. The student landed on a lawn and was temporarily knocked unconscious. She suffered serious head injuries. If the student asserts a claim against the corporation to recover damages for her injuries, she will most likely

Options:

A: not prevail, because the student failed to secure the helmet strap properly.
B: prevail, because the corporation was negligent in their depiction of the helmet's use.
C: prevail, because the corporation failed to test the helmet for use in non-combat situations.
D: prevail, because under the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur negligence can be inferred from the fact that the helmet came off the student's head.
E: prevail, because the original package depicted a picture of a cyclist wearing the helmet.
F: prevail, because the corporation should have provided a warning against using the helmet for non-military purposes.
G: not prevail, because the student assumed the risk by choosing to use the helmet while cycling.
H: not prevail, because the helmet had been properly designed by the corporation for its intended use by the Army and Marine Corps.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this legal question about the student and the helmet. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the scenario: A 20-year-old ROTC student is at a Marine Corps camp for training. She gets a new synthetic helmet made of Kevlar, which is supposed to replace the old steel ones. The helmets were bought by an agency for the Army and Marines. The helmet was in its original packaging from the manufacturing corporation. The box has a picture of an off-duty Marine wearing the helmet while riding a bike. So, the student sees that and thinks, "Oh, maybe I can use this as a bike helmet." She does, and during a ride, she hits a pothole, gets thrown off, the helmet strap comes loose, it falls off, and she gets seriously injured. Now she's suing the corporation for her injuries.

The question is whether she'll prevail in her claim. The options are A through H, each with different reasons.

I think I need to consider product liability here. The corporation is the manufacturer, and she's claiming they're responsible for her injuries. Let's think about the possible theories: negligence, breach of warranty, or strict liability.

Strict liability might apply if the product was defective and the defect caused the injury. Under strict liability, the plaintiff doesn't have to prove negligence, just that the product was defective and that the defect led to their injury.

Looking at the helmet: It was designed for military use, not for cycling. The packaging had a picture of someone biking with it, but that might have been misleading. The student used it for a non-military purpose, which the helmet wasn't designed for. The helmet came off because the strap loosened, leading to her injury.

In product liability, one kind of defect is a design defect. If the helmet wasn't designed to protect in non-military situations like cycling, maybe it's defective. But wait, the helmet was intended for military use, so if she used it for something it wasn't designed for, that's misuse. Manufacturers generally aren't liable for misuse unless they should have foreseen that misuse or if they failed to warn against it.

So, did the corporation warn against using the helmet for non-military purposes? The options suggest that option F says they should have provided a warning. If they didn't warn, that could be a failure, leading to liability.

Alternatively, the helmet's design might not have been adequate for the intended use. But the intended use was military, and it was made with Kevlar, which is strong. So maybe it's not a design defect but misuse.

Another angle is assumption of risk. If the student used the helmet in a way it wasn't intended, she might have assumed the risk. That's more of a defense. Option G says she assumed the risk, so she wouldn't prevail.

But assumption of risk isn't always a complete defense; it depends on whether the misuse was foreseeable. If the manufacturer could have foreseen that people might use the helmet for cycling, then maybe they should have designed it to be safe for that or warned against it.

Looking at the options, option H says she won't prevail because the helmet was properly designed for its intended use. That seems correct if the intended use was military and she misused it. But if the misuse was foreseeable, then maybe the manufacturer should have designed it to be safe for that foreseeable misuse, or warned against it.

Option F says the corporation should have warned against non-military use. If there was no warning, that could be a failure. So if the court finds that the manufacturer should have warned against using it as a bike helmet, then the student might prevail.

But another point is whether the helmet was defectively designed. If the design was adequate for its intended military use but not for cycling, but the manufacturer didn't warn, then perhaps strict liability applies for failure to warn.

So, the key here is whether the manufacturer provided adequate warnings. The packaging showed a picture of a Marine biking with it, which might imply that it's safe for biking. That could be misleading. So the corporation might have a duty to warn against using the helmet for non-military purposes, especially if they depicted such use.

If the manufacturer didn't warn, that could be negligence per option F. So the student might prevail because the corporation failed to provide a warning.

Alternatively, if the helmet was properly designed for its intended use, as in option H, then the misuse by the student would mean she assumed the risk, and the manufacturer isn't liable.

I think the correct approach is to consider whether the manufacturer should have warned against non-military use. Since the helmet was depicted in a biking scenario, it's possible that the manufacturer should have included a warning that it's not suitable for cycling. If they didn't, that's negligence, and the student could prevail.

So, looking at the options, option F says she prevails because the corporation should have warned against non-military use. That seems like a strong argument.

But wait, another point is that the helmet came off because the strap loosened. Maybe the design was defective in that the straps weren't secure enough, but that's more about design. However, since the intended use was military, maybe the design was adequate.

Alternatively, if the helmet was used for cycling, which the manufacturer's picture suggested it could be used for, then maybe the manufacturer should have tested it for that use or designed it to be secure in such situations.

But I'm leaning towards the failure to warn. If the manufacturer's packaging depicted the helmet being used for biking without a warning, that could be a contributing factor to the misuse, making them liable.

Therefore, the answer is likely F: prevail because the corporation should have provided a warning against using the helmet for non-military purposes.

The student's claim likely hinges on whether the corporation provided adequate warnings about the helmet's intended use. The helmet was designed for military purposes, and its packaging included a picture suggesting it could be used for cycling, potentially misleading the student. If the corporation failed to warn against non-military use, that could constitute negligence, supporting the student's claim. Therefore, the correct answer is:

F
