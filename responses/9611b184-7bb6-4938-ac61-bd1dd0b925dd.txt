Okay, so I'm trying to figure out what the output of this FORTRAN program is. Let me look at the code carefully. 

The program starts with some declarations. There's a dimension statement: A is an array of 8 elements, and PTR is also an array of 8 elements. Then there's the data section where A is assigned some characters: 'A', 'S', 'E', 'Q', 'N', 'U', 'T', '1'. So A(1) is 'A', A(2) is 'S', and so on up to A(8) which is '1'.

Next, the PTR array is given values: 4,7,2,6,6,3,0,5. So PTR(1) is 4, PTR(2) is 7, etc.

The main part of the program starts with I being set to PTR(1), which is 4. So I = 4.

Then there's a loop labeled 20. The condition is if I equals 0, then go to 30. Since I is 4, it doesn't go to 30, so it proceeds. It writes A(I) to unit 5 using format 100, which is a single character. So first, it writes A(4), which is 'Q'.

After writing, I is set to PTR(I), which is PTR(4). Looking at the PTR array, PTR(4) is 6. So now I is 6.

We go back to the loop at 20 again. I is 6, not 0. So write A(6), which is 'U'. Then I becomes PTR(6). PTR(6) is 3. So I is now 3.

Loop again. I is 3, not 0. Write A(3), which is 'E'. Then I becomes PTR(3), which is 2. So I is 2.

Another loop. Write A(2), which is 'S'. I becomes PTR(2), which is 7. Now I is 7.

Loop again. Write A(7), which is 'T'. I becomes PTR(7), which is 0. Now I is 0.

Back to the loop condition. Since I is 0, we go to 30. So the loop stops after this step.

So the characters written in order are: Q, U, E, S, T. Wait, that's 'QUEST' but let me count the steps again.

Wait, let's list the steps:

1. I = PTR(1) = 4 → write A(4) = Q → sequence: Q
2. I = PTR(4) = 6 → write A(6) = U → QU
3. I = PTR(6) = 3 → write A(3) = E → QUE
4. I = PTR(3) = 2 → write A(2) = S → QUES
5. I = PTR(2) = 7 → write A(7) = T → QUEST
6. I = PTR(7) = 0 → loop ends.

So the output is 'QUEST', which is option D.

The program writes characters from array A using indices from array PTR until PTR points to 0. The sequence of indices and corresponding characters is 4→6→3→2→7, yielding "QUEST".

Answer: D
