Question:

What will happen to transfer earnings and economic rent if landhas only a single use?

Options:

A: The price of the land is entirely made up of transfer earnings.
B: Economic rent remains constant while transfer earnings fluctuate with market demands.
C: Transfer earnings are zero and the price of the land is entirely made up of economic rent.
D: Both transfer earnings and economic rent increase proportionally.

F: Transfer earnings decrease and economic rent increases.
G: Both transfer earnings and economic rent are zero.
H: Transfer earnings increase and economic rent decreases.
I: Economic rent increases to the point where it constitutes the majority, but not all, of the land price, with the remainder being transfer earnings.
J: Transfer earnings are constant, and economic rent decreases to zero.

Okay, so I've got this question about transfer earnings and economic rent when land has only a single use. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

First, I remember that in economics, land can be considered a factor of production, and its value is often split into economic rent and transfer earnings. Economic rent is the amount that exceeds the minimum required to keep the land in its current use. Transfer earnings, on the other hand, are the returns that could be transferred if the land were used for another purpose.

Wait, so if the land has only a single use, that probably means it can't be used for any alternative purposes. So the person owns land that's only good for one thing, maybe farming or something else, but not multiple uses.

In that case, what happens to transfer earnings? Transfer earnings are based on the next best alternative use. If there's only one use, there are no alternatives, so the transfer earnings would be zero because there's nowhere else the resources could go. The land can't be used for anything else, so the earnings from other uses don't exist.

Now, economic rent is the difference between what the land actually earns and what it would earn in the next best use. Since there's no next best use (only one use), the entire surplus goes to economic rent. So the price of the land would be made up entirely of economic rent because there's no transfer earnings component.

Looking at the options, option C says transfer earnings are zero and the price is entirely economic rent. That makes sense. Let me check the other options to be sure.

Option A says the price is entirely transfer earnings, which doesn't fit because if there's only one use, transfer earnings should be zero. Option B talks about economic rent being constant and transfer earnings fluctuating, but without alternatives, transfer earnings can't fluctuateâ€”they're zero. Option D and E suggest both increase or vary inversely, but without alternatives, transfer earnings aren't there. Option F says transfer earnings decrease and rent increases, but if they were already zero, that might not make sense. Option G says both are zero, which isn't right because the land still has value. Option H suggests transfer earnings increase and rent decreases, which doesn't fit. Option I says rent is the majority but not all, but in this case, it should be all. Option J says transfer earnings are constant and rent decreases to zero, which is the opposite of what should happen.

So yeah, the correct answer should be option C: Transfer earnings are zero and the price is entirely economic rent.

When land has only a single use, transfer earnings are zero because there are no alternative uses to generate such earnings. Consequently, the land's price is entirely composed of economic rent.
