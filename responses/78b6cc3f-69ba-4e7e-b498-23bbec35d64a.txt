Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how many points a touchdown is worth in American football. I don't know much about football, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that touchdowns are a big deal because they're worth a lot of points. I think it's more than a field goal, which I believe is three points. So options F and C are probably not it. 

I've heard the term "touchdown" a lot, and I think it's the primary way teams score. Maybe it's six points? I think that's right because I've heard people say "touchdown, six points!" during games. Let me see the options again. Option A is six, so that seems likely. 

Wait, are there any other possibilities? I think sometimes touchdowns can be followed by extra points, like one or two points, but that's after the touchdown. The touchdown itself is the main score. So yeah, I'm pretty sure it's six points.
