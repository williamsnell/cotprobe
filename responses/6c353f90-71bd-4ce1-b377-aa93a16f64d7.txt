Okay, so I have this economics problem here about supply and demand schedules. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to figure it out step by step.

First, the question has two parts: a and b. Part a asks for the equilibrium price, and part b is about whether there's a surplus or shortage if the price is set at $4.00.

Looking at the data provided, it's a supply and demand table. Let me try to parse the numbers correctly. The first part lists Quantity demanded and Price, then Quantity supplied. Then there's a continuation with more numbers.

Wait, maybe I should list out the data properly. Let's see:

From the first part:
- Quantity demanded: 3000, Price: $4.00, Quantity supplied: 1200
- Quantity demanded: 2800, Price: $4.05, Quantity supplied: 1600
- Quantity demanded: 2500, Price: $4.10, Quantity supplied: 1900

Then the continuation:
- Quantity demanded: 2100, Price: $4.15, Quantity supplied: 2100
- Quantity demanded: 2000, Price: $4.20, Quantity supplied: 2450
- Quantity demanded: 1700, Price: $4.25, Quantity supplied: 2900

Wait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me check again. The first line is Quantity demanded, then Price, then Quantity supplied. So each row represents a different price level, with corresponding quantities demanded and supplied.

So for each price point:

Price | Quantity Demanded | Quantity Supplied
$4.00 | 3000             | 1200
$4.05 | 2800             | 1600
$4.10 | 2500             | 1900
$4.15 | 2100             | 2100
$4.20 | 2000             | 2450
$4.25 | 1700             | 2900

Wait, that makes more sense. So each row is a different price, and for each, we have the quantity demanded and supplied.

Equilibrium occurs where Quantity Demanded equals Quantity Supplied. So I need to find the price where these two numbers match.

Let's go through each price:

- At $4.00: Demanded 3000, Supplied 1200. Not equal.
- At $4.05: Demanded 2800, Supplied 1600. Not equal.
- At $4.10: Demanded 2500, Supplied 1900. Not equal.
- At $4.15: Demanded 2100, Supplied 2100. Oh, here they are equal.

So the equilibrium price is $4.15, since that's where quantity demanded equals quantity supplied (2100 each). So part a's answer is $4.15.

Now part b: If the price is set at $4.00, what happens? Let's look at the numbers at $4.00. Quantity demanded is 3000, supplied is 1200. So demand is higher than supply. That means there's a shortage. The shortage is the difference between demanded and supplied: 3000 - 1200 = 1800 units.

Wait, but looking at the options, I see some about surplus and others about shortage. The question is, at $4.00, is there a surplus or shortage? At $4.00, since quantity demanded exceeds supplied, it's a shortage. The amount is 1800.

Now, looking at the options:

Option C says $4.15, shortage of 1800. But wait, that's for the equilibrium, which is part a. Part b is about $4.00. So let me check the options again.

Looking for part a and b:

Option A: $4.15, surplus 300. No, part a is $4.15, but part b is about $4.00.

Option B: $4.20, shortage 1200. No, part a is $4.15.

Option C: $4.15, shortage 1800. This is part a correct, but part b isn't addressed here.

Wait, but looking at the options, each option seems to be for part a and part b together. So each option is a pair: for a) equilibrium price and b) surplus or shortage at $4.00.

Wait, the options are structured as a) find equilibrium price, and b) determine surplus/shortage at $4.00. So each option is a combination of a and b.

Looking at the options:

A: $4.15, surplus of 300 units. So part a is $4.15 (correct), part b is surplus 300. But at $4.00, we have a shortage, so A is wrong.

B: $4.20, shortage 1200. Part a is wrong; equilibrium is $4.15.

C: $4.15, shortage of 1800. Part a correct, part b correct. Because at $4.00, shortage is 1800. So this would be option C.

Wait, but let me confirm. If the price is set at $4.00, which is below the equilibrium price of $4.15, the quantity supplied will be less than quantity demanded, leading to a shortage.

Yes, so the equilibrium price is $4.15, and at $4.00, shortage is 1800.

Looking at the options, option C states: $4.15, shortage of 1800 units. So that's the correct choice.

Wait, but let me check other options to be sure.

Option D: $4.00, surplus 1800. No, because at $4.00, demand exceeds supply, so it's a shortage.

Option E: $4.10, surplus 300. Part a wrong.

Option F: $4.10, equilibrium. No, equilibrium is at $4.15.

Option G: $4.05, equilibrium. No.

Option H: $4.00, shortage 1200. Part a is wrong, but part b is incorrect because at $4.00, shortage is 1800, not 1200.

Option I: $4.20, surplus 450. Part a wrong.

Option J: $4.25, surplus 1000. Part a wrong.

So the correct option is C: $4.15, shortage of 1800 units.

The equilibrium price is found where quantity demanded equals quantity supplied, which occurs at $4.15. At this price, both quantity demanded and supplied are 2100 units, indicating equilibrium. For part b, if the price is set at $4.00, the quantity demanded is 3000 units, while the quantity supplied is 1200 units. This results in a shortage of 1800 units (3000 - 1200). Therefore, the correct answer is:

C: $4.15, shortage of 1800 units.
