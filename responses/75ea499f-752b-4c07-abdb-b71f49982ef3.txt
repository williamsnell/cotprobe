Question:

There are only three active stations in a slotted Aloha network: A, B and C. Each station generates a frame in a time slot with the corresponding probabilities p_A=0.2, p_B=0.3 and p_C=0.4 respectively. What is the normalized throughput of the system?

Options:

A: 0.700
B: 0.275
C: 0.250
D: 0.300
E: 0.528
F: 0.452
G: 0.600
H: 0.485
I: 0.350
J: 0.500

Okay, I need to find the normalized throughput of a slotted Aloha network with three active stations: A, B, and C. Their probabilities of generating a frame in a time slot are 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4 respectively. 

Normalized throughput in a slotted Aloha system is calculated when the probability of a station transmitting in a slot is low enough that collisions are minimal. For a single station, the formula is p/(1-p), but with multiple stations, it's a bit different.

Wait, actually, in the case of multiple stations, the normalized throughput is the sum of each station's probability multiplied by the product of their own probability and the probabilities of the other stations not transmitting. Because for a station to successfully transmit, it must send a frame while all others don't.

So the formula for each station's throughput is p_i * (1 - p_i) * (1 - p_j) * (1 - p_k), but since there are three stations, it's p_i * product of (1-p_j) for j not i.

Wait, no, actually, the formula is p_i multiplied by the product of (1 - p_j) for all j ≠ i. Because for station i to successfully transmit, it must send (prob p_i) and all others must not send (prob 1-p_j for each j). 

So the normalized throughput Σ is the sum for each station of p_i multiplied by the product of (1-p_j) for all j not equal to i.

So let's calculate each term:

For station A (p_A=0.2):
Term A = 0.2 * (1-0.3) * (1-0.4) = 0.2 * 0.7 * 0.6 = 0.2 * 0.42 = 0.084.

For station B (p_B=0.3):
Term B = 0.3 * (1-0.2) * (1-0.4) = 0.3 * 0.8 * 0.6 = 0.3 * 0.48 = 0.144.

For station C (p_C=0.4):
Term C = 0.4 * (1-0.2) * (1-0.3) = 0.4 * 0.8 * 0.7 = 0.4 * 0.56 = 0.224.

Now sum all three terms: 0.084 + 0.144 + 0.224 = 0.452.

So the normalized throughput is 0.452. Looking at the options, option F is 0.452. So the answer should be F.

The normalized throughput is calculated by summing the contributions from each station, considering their transmission probabilities and the probabilities of other stations not transmitting. The result is 0.452, which corresponds to option F.
