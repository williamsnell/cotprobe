Okay, so I've got this problem here about the velocities of nitrogen and oxygen gases. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my gas mixture concepts, but I'll try to remember what I learned.

The problem states that the mixture contains equal weights of N₂ and O₂. So, the mass of N₂ equals the mass of O₂. The velocities given are v_N2 = -7i m/s and v_O2 = +7i m/s. Wait, so the N₂ is moving in the negative x-direction, and O₂ in the positive. Interesting.

I need to find both the average mass velocity and the average molar velocity. Hmm, I think average mass velocity is the velocity weighted by mass, and average molar velocity is the velocity weighted by moles. But wait, wait, I'm not entirely sure. Let me think.

First, I remember that for a mixture of gases, the average velocities can be calculated based on whether you're considering mass or moles. So, average mass velocity is the total momentum divided by the total mass, and average molar velocity is the total moles multiplied by their respective velocities divided by total moles, right?

Wait, wait. Momentum is mass times velocity. So, the total momentum would be sum of each gas's momentum. Since the problem gives equal mass for each gas, perhaps that will simplify things.

Wait, the mass of N₂ and O₂ are equal. Let me denote the mass of each as m. So, total mass is 2m.

Now, for the velocities: N₂ is moving at -7i, O₂ at +7i.

So, the momentum of N₂ is m * (-7i) = -7m i.

Momentum of O₂ is m * (7i) = +7m i.

Adding these gives total momentum = (-7m +7m) i = 0. So, the total momentum is zero. Therefore, the average mass velocity (which is total momentum over total mass) would be 0/(2m) = 0. So, average mass velocity is 0i m/s. That would eliminate some options.

Looking at the options, option B and option F say average mass velocity is 0. Let me check the other part, the molar average velocity.

Molar average velocity is the sum of (moles of each gas times their velocity) divided by total moles. So, I need to calculate the moles of N₂ and O₂.

Since the masses are equal, and the molar masses are different, the moles will not be equal.

Molar mass of N₂ is 28 g/mol (14*2), and O₂ is 32 g/mol (16*2). So, if the mass is the same, say m grams, then moles of N₂ = m / 28, and moles of O₂ = m /32.

Wait, let me think again. Let's say the mass of each is m. So, for N₂, moles n_N2 = m / (28 g/mol), and for O₂, n_O2 = m / (32 g/mol).

So, the total moles n_total = m/28 + m/32.

Now, the sum of moles times velocity:

n_N2 * v_N2 + n_O2 * v_O2 = (m/28)(-7) + (m/32)(7).

Factor out m and 7i:

= m*7i [ (-1/28) + (1/32) ) ]

Let me compute this inside the brackets: (-1/28) + (1/32) = (-32 + 28)/(28*32) )= (-4)/(896) )= -1/(224).

Wait, wait, let me compute it correctly.

Compute (-1/28) + (1/32) = (-32 +28)/(28*32) )= (-4)/(896) )= -1/224.

So, the sum is m*7i * (-1/224) )= (7m * (-1) )/(224) *i = -7m/(224) i.

Simplify: 7/224 = 1/32, so it's (-m * 1)/(32) )= -m/(32) i.

Now, the average molar velocity is this sum divided by total moles.

Total moles n_total = m/28 + m/32.

Let me compute that: m(1/28 +1/32) = m*( (32 +28)/(28*32) ))= m*(60)/(896) )= 60m/896.

Simplify: 60/896 = 15/224.

So, average molar velocity = [ -m/(32) i ] / [60m/896 ) ].

Wait, the m cancels out. So,

= [ (-1/32) ] / (60/896) ) * i.

Let me compute 60/896: Let's divide numerator and denominator by 4: 15/224.

So, 1/32 divided by (60/896) is same as (1/32) * (896/60) ).

896 divided by 32 is 28, since 32*28=896. So,

(1/32) * (896/60) )= (28)/(60) )= 7/15.

Wait, but I had a negative sign. So, - (7/15) i m/s.

Wait, but 7/15 is approximately 0.4667. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options, option B says molar average velocity is -0.42i, which is close but not exactly 7/15. Let me check if I did the calculation correctly.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the arithmetic. Let me recheck.

Computing the velocities:

n_N2 = m /28, n_O2 = m /32.

Sum of (n*v):

n_N2 * v_N2 = (m/28)*(-7) = -7m/28 = -m/4.

n_O2 * v_O2 = (m/32)*(7) = 7m/32.

So sum = (-m/4) + (7m/32) = [ (-8m +7m) ] /32 = (-m)/32.

Total moles: n_total = m/28 + m/32 = m(1/28 +1/32) = m( (32 +28) / (28*32) ))= m(60/896).

So, average molar velocity = sum / n_total = (-m/32) / (60m/896) )

The m cancels, so:

= (-1/32) / (60/896) )= (-1/32) * (896/60) )= (896)/(32 *60 ) * (-1).

896 /32 is 28, so 28/60 = 7/15 ≈ 0.4667.

So, average molar velocity is approximately -0.4667i m/s. Looking at the options, option B says -0.42i, which is close but not exactly the same. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me recheck the sum of (n*v).

n_N2 = m/28, v_N2 = -7.

n_N2*v_N2 = (m/28)*(-7) = -7m/28 = -m/4.

n_O2*v_O2 = (m/32)*7 = 7m/32.

Sum: (-m/4) + (7m/32) = (-8m +7m)/32 = (-m)/32.

Total moles: m/28 + m/32 = m*(32 +28)/(28*32) )= m*60/(896).

So average = (-m/32) / (60m/896) )= (-1/32) * (896/60) )= (-896)/(32*60) )= (-28)/(60) )= -7/15 ≈ -0.4667.

So, the molar average velocity is approximately -0.467i m/s. Looking at the options, option B says -0.42i, which is close but not exact. Alternatively, perhaps I made an approximation error or the options rounded it differently. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, another approach: maybe it's the other way around. Let me think again about which velocity is which. The problem says v_N2 is -7i and v_O2 is +7i.

Wait, perhaps I should take the absolute values correctly. Let me recompute the sum:

n_N2*v_N2 = (m/28)*(-7) = -7m/28 = -m/4.

n_O2*v_O2 = (m/32)*(7) = 7m/32.

Adding them: (-m/4) + (7m/32) = (-8m +7m)/32 = (-m)/32.

So the sum is -m/32.

Total moles: m/28 + m/32 = m*(1/28 + 1/32) = m*( (32 +28)/(28*32) )= m*(60/896) )= m*(15/224).

So, average molar velocity is (-m/32)/(15m/224) )= (-1/32) * (224/15) )= (-224)/(32*15) )= (-7)/(15) ≈ -0.4667i m/s.

So, the options don't have exactly this value. Option B is -0.42i, which is close but not exact. Alternatively, perhaps I messed up the calculation. Let me compute 7/15 exactly: 7 ÷15 is 0.466666..., so about -0.4667i.

Looking at the options, none have exactly this. Hmm. Let me check the options again.

Option H says average mass velocity is -0.42i and molar is 0.42i. That can't be right because average mass velocity is zero, as we found earlier.

Wait, option B says average mass velocity is 0 and average molar is -0.42i. That's close to what I calculated, but perhaps the question expects rounding to two decimal places, making it -0.47i. But none of the options have that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the velocities. Let me double-check.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I should have considered the absolute values of the velocities. Or maybe I should add the vectors as they are.

Wait, no, the velocities are given as vectors, so the signs matter. So, N₂ is moving left, O₂ right.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the average velocity in terms of direction, so maybe I should have taken the absolute values. Wait, no, I don't think so because the problem gives signed velocities.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Let me think again.

Wait, average mass velocity is total momentum over total mass, which we found to be zero because N₂ and O₂ have equal and opposite momenta.

So, mass average velocity is zero.

For molar average velocity, it's sum(n_i * v_i) / sum(n_i).

n_i is moles of each gas.

So, n_N2 = m/(M_N2) = m/(28 g/mol).

n_O2 = m/(32 g/mol).

v_N2 = -7, v_O2 = +7.

Sum(n*v) = [m/28 * (-7) ] + [m/32 *7 ].

Which is (-7m/28) + (7m/32) = (-m/4) + (7m/32).

As before, this is (-8m +7m)/32 = (-m)/32.

Total moles n_total = m/28 + m/32 = m*(32+28)/(28*32) )= m*60/(896) )= 15m/224.

So average molar velocity = (-m/32) / (15m/224) )= (-1/32) * (224/15) )= (-224)/(32*15) )= (-7)/(15) ≈ -0.4667.

So, approximately -0.467i. The closest option would be option B, which is -0.42i. But wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in fractions.

Wait, 7/15 is exactly 0.466666..., so maybe the options are approximate. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects to express it as 7/15 i, but that's not an option.

Wait, looking at the options again:

Option B: Average mass velocity is 0 and molar is -0.42i.

Option H: mass -0.42i, molar 0.42i.

But our calculation shows mass average is zero, and molar is approximately -0.467i.

Looking at the options, none have exactly -0.467i. Hmm. Did I make a mistake in the problem setup?

Wait, another possibility: maybe the velocities are given as vectors, but when taking the average, perhaps their signs affect the calculation differently.

Wait, let me think again. For the molar average velocity, it's (n1 v1 + n2 v2)/(n1 +n2).

n1 = m/28, v1= -7.

n2 = m/32, v2= +7.

So sum = (m/28)(-7) + (m/32)(7) = (-7m/28) + (7m/32) = (-m/4) + (7m/32).

Which is (-8m +7m)/32 = (-m)/32.

n_total = m/28 + m/32 = 60m/896.

So average velocity = (-m/32) / (60m/896) )= (-1/32) * (896/60) )= (-28)/(60) )= -7/15 ≈ -0.4667.

So, I'm confident in this calculation. Since none of the options match exactly, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, wait another thought: maybe the velocities are given as speed magnitudes, and I should take the absolute values for the velocities. But the problem states "absolute velocities," which I think refers to speed, but they have direction vectors. Hmm, perhaps not. The problem says "absolute velocities are given as: v_N2 = -7i, v_O2 = +7i." So, I think the signs are important.

Alternatively, perhaps the average molar velocity is the opposite sign. Let me check.

Wait, in my calculation, the sum was negative, so average velocity is negative. So, the molar average is negative.

Looking at the options, option B is average mass 0, molar -0.42i. Option E is mass -3.5i, molar 3.5i. Option H is mass -0.42i, molar 0.42i.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the calculation.

Hmm, another approach: maybe the velocities are in opposite directions, but their contributions could lead to a lower magnitude. Alternatively, perhaps I should look for the average in terms of the given options.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in assuming the mass is the same. Let me confirm: the mixture has equal weights (masses) of each gas. So, m_N2 = m_O2 = m.

So, that part is correct.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of 7/15. Let me compute it again.

7 ÷15:

15 ×0.4=6, 15×0.46=6.9, 15×0.466=6.99, 15×0.4666=6.999, so 7/15≈0.4667.

So, the average molar velocity is approximately -0.467i, which is about -0.47i m/s.

Looking back at the options, option B is -0.42i, which is close but not exact. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects an exact fraction, but the options don't have that.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I should calculate using the molar masses correctly.

Molar mass of N₂ is 28 g/mol, O₂ is 32 g/mol. So, for a given mass m, moles are m/(28) and m/(32).

So, the earlier approach is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the average molar velocity is the other way around. Let me see:

Wait, if the velocities were both positive, the sum would be higher, but in this case, N₂ is negative, O₂ positive. Let me recompute.

Sum = (n_N2 * v_N2) + (n_O2 * v_O2) = (m/28)(-7) + (m/32)(7) = (-7m/28) + (7m/32) = (-m/4) + (7m/32) = (-8m +7m)/32 = (-m)/32.

Yes, that's correct.

So, average molar velocity is (-m/32) / (60m/896) )= (-1/32) * (896/60) )= (-28)/(60)= -7/15.

Hmm, perhaps the options have a typo, but based on the given options, the closest is option B, which is average mass velocity 0 and molar -0.42i.

Wait, but 7/15 is approximately 0.4667, which is closer to 0.47i, but the option B says 0.42i.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the sum of moles. Let me recheck:

n_total = m/28 + m/32.

= m*(32 +28)/(28*32) )= m*(60)/(896) )= (60m)/(896).

Which simplifies to (15m)/(224).

So, 60/896 is 15/224, which is approximately 0.06696 m.

Hmm, perhaps I should express the average in terms of exact fractions.

Wait, 7/15 is exactly 0.466666..., which is approximately 0.467.

Looking at the options again, none have exactly this value. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the question is considering the average velocities as the vector sum, but weighted by something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the molar average velocity is calculated differently. Let me think: the average molar velocity is the sum of (moles_i * velocity_i) divided by total moles.

Which is what I did. So, perhaps the calculation is correct, and the options are approximations. So, option B is the closest, but it's -0.42i, not exactly -0.467i.

Alternatively, perhaps I should recheck the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the arithmetic when computing 7/15. Let me do it again.

7 ÷15:

15 ×0.4=6 → remainder 1.

0.4 → 6. So, 0.46 → 15×0.46=6.9 → remainder 0.1.

0.46 + 0.006 → 15×0.466=6.99 → rem 0.01.

0.466 + 0.0006 → 15×0.4666=6.999 → rem 0.001.

So, 7/15 = 0.466666..., which is approximately 0.467.

So, the molar average velocity is approximately -0.467i.

Looking back, the options don't have that. Perhaps the correct option is not listed, but the closest is option B.

Wait, but let me look at option B: average mass velocity 0, molar -0.42i. So, maybe the intended answer is option B, considering that 7/15 is approximately 0.4667, which is about 0.47, but perhaps the options rounded it to 0.42. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is considering the average of the absolute velocities, but that doesn't seem right. Because the problem gives signed velocities.

Alternatively, perhaps I should take the absolute values of the velocities for the average. Let me try that.

If I take absolute values, then for N₂, |v|=7, O₂ |v|=7.

But their directions are opposite, so their contributions would be:

n_N2 *7 + n_O2 *7 = 7*(n_N2 +n_O2) = 7*(n_total).

So average molar velocity would be 7*(n_total)/n_total )=7i.

But that can't be right because the directions are opposite, so their contributions would subtract, not add.

Wait, but that approach doesn't account for the direction, which seems wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the average of the speeds, but the question says velocities, which include direction.

Hmm, perhaps I should proceed with the calculation as correct and see which option matches.

So, average mass velocity is 0, molar average velocity is approximately -0.467i.

Looking at the options, the only one that matches average mass velocity 0 is option B and F.

Option B says average molar is -0.42i, which is close but not exact. Option F says average molar is 0, which isn't correct.

So, perhaps the intended answer is option B, with the molar average velocity being approximately -0.42i.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps I should think about this differently. Let me compute the exact value.

7/15 is exactly equal to 0.466666..., so the molar average velocity is -7/15 i.

Looking at the options, none have this, but perhaps option H is a possibility, but it has positive 0.42i for molar, which is opposite in sign.

Wait, no, option H says average mass velocity is -0.42i and average molar 0.42i. That can't be right because mass average is 0.

So, I'm stuck. The only option that fits the mass average being 0 is option B and F.

Option F: mass average 0, molar 0 → no, that's not correct.

Option B: mass average 0, molar -0.42i. Closest to our calculation.

But perhaps the intended answer is option B. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to consider that the molar masses are different, so the average is not zero.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question is asking for the average velocity in the sense of vector addition, but I think I did that correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the average molar velocity is the same as the average velocity of the center of mass, but that's what I calculated.

Hmm, maybe I should go with option B as the closest, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is option E or H, but I don't think so.
</think>

The problem involves a mixture of nitrogen (N₂) and oxygen (O₂) gases with equal masses. The absolute velocities are given as **v_N₂ = -7i m/s** and **v_O₂ = +7i m/s**. The goal is to determine the average mass velocity and the average molar velocity.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Average Mass Velocity**:
   - The total momentum is calculated as the sum of the momenta of N₂ and O₂.
   - Momentum of N₂: \( p_{N_2} = m \cdot (-7) = -7m \, i \, \text{m/s} \)
   - Momentum of O₂: \( p_{O_2} = m \cdot (+7) = +7m \, i \, \text{m/s} \)
   - Total momentum: \( p_{\text{total}} = -7m + 7m = 0 \)
   - Total mass: \( m_{\text{total}} = m + m = 2m \)
   - Average mass velocity: \( \frac{p_{\text{total}}}{m_{\text{total}}} = \frac{0}{2m} = 0 \, \text{m/s} \)

2. **Average Molar Velocity**:
   - Molar mass of N₂: \( M_{N_2} = 28 \, \text{g/mol} \)
   - Molar mass of O₂: \( M_{O_2} = 32 \, \text{g/mol} \)
   - Moles of N₂: \( n_{N_2} = \frac{m}{28} \)
   - Moles of O₂: \( n_{O_2} = \frac{m}{32} \)
   - Total moles: \( n_{\text{total}} = \frac{m}{28} + \frac{m}{32} = m \left( \frac{1}{28} + \frac{1}{32} \right) = m \cdot \frac{60}{896} = \frac{15m}{224} \)
   - Contribution to velocity:
     - \( n_{N_2} \cdot v_{N_2} = \frac{m}{28} \cdot (-7) = -\frac{7m}{28} = -\frac{m}{4} \)
     - \( n_{O_2} \cdot v_{O_2} = \frac{m}{32} \cdot (+7) = +\frac{7m}{32} \)
   - Total contribution: \( -\frac{m}{4} + \frac{7m}{32} = \frac{-8m + 7m}{32} = -\frac{m}{32} \)
   - Average molar velocity: \( \frac{\text{Total contribution}}{n_{\text{total}}} = \frac{-\frac{m}{32}}{\frac{15m}{224}} = -\frac{1}{32} \cdot \frac{224}{15} = -\frac{224}{480} = -\frac{7}{15} \approx -0.4667 \, \text{m/s} \)

### Conclusion:
- The average mass velocity is **0 m/s**.
- The average molar velocity is approximately **-0.4667 m/s**, which is closest to **-0.42i m/s** among the given options.

### Final Answer:
**B**
