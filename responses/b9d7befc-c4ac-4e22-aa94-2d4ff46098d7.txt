Question:

A person who has had an opportunity to contribute to the establishmentof objectives regarding his or her performance willhave a greater degree of commitment and motivation in attemptingto achieve those objectives. State and discuss thetheory underlying this statement. How is itimplemented practicallyto motivate employees ?

Options:

A: The theory is the Hierarchy of Needs by Maslow, and it is implemented by providing employees with a path for career progression and fulfilling higher-level needs.
B: The theory is implemented through punishments and rewards
C: The theory is known as the Two-Factor Theory by Herzberg, which is applied by addressing hygiene factors and providing intrinsic motivators such as recognition and achievement.
D: The theory is implemented through increasing employee's workload
E: The theory is implemented through strict supervision
F: The theory is known as the Equity Theory, which is put into practice by ensuring fair treatment of employees and balancing input and output ratios among workers.
G: The theory is the Self-Determination Theory, which is implemented by promoting autonomy, competence, and relatedness in the workplace.
H: The theory is the Social Learning Theory, and it is put into practice by using role models and mentors to demonstrate desirable behaviors and outcomes.
I: The theory underlying this statement is Management by Objectives (MBO), which involves mutual goal-setting between employees and management. It is practically implemented through programs such as job simplification, job enrichment, suggestion plans, and job redesign.
J: The theory is based on the Expectancy Theory of motivation, implemented through clear communication of performance criteria and linking outcomes directly to performance.

Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about the theory behind employee motivation when they're involved in setting objectives. The question is asking which theory explains why someone would be more committed and motivated when they help set their performance goals, and how that theory is practically applied.

Let me read through each option to understand them better.

Option A: It mentions Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs. Maslow's theory is about层次 needs, starting from basic needs like physiological and safety, moving up to social, esteem, and self-actualization. The implementation here is providing career paths for higher-level needs. But does this directly relate to setting objectives? I'm not sure. Career progression is more about fulfilling esteem or self-actualization, but the question is about contributing to objectives.

Option B: This says the theory is implemented through punishments and rewards. That sounds more like Skinner's operant conditioning or perhaps Taylor's scientific management, which uses rewards and punishment. But the question is about the theory underlying the statement, not just the method. So B might not be the right theory.

Option C: Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory. Herzberg distinguishes between hygiene factors (like salary, work conditions) which prevent dissatisfaction, and motivators (like recognition, achievement, growth) that lead to satisfaction. The implementation here is about addressing hygiene factors and providing intrinsic motivators. But does this directly tie into setting objectives? Maybe not directly, because Herzberg's theory is more about factors that satisfy vs. those that motivate, but I'm not sure it's about goal setting.

Option D: Increasing workload. That doesn't sound like a theory but more like a management practice. Also, more workload without motivation might lead to stress, not necessarily commitment.

Option E: Strict supervision. That's more about control rather than motivation. It doesn't align with the idea of employees contributing to objectives, which is more about autonomy.

Option F: Equity Theory by Adams. Equity theory is about fairness and employees' perception of their inputs and outputs relative to others. Implementation is ensuring fair treatment and balancing input and output. But how does this relate to setting objectives? Maybe not directly, unless the fairness is in how goals are set, but I'm not sure.

Option G: Self-Determination Theory by Deci and Ryan. This theory focuses on three needs: autonomy, competence, and relatedness. Implementation is promoting these in the workplace. If employees have autonomy in setting their goals, that could increase motivation. This might fit because setting their own objectives gives them autonomy and competence.

Option H: Social Learning Theory. This is about learning through observation, using role models. Implementation via mentors and role models. While this can influence behavior, it doesn't directly explain the commitment from setting goals.

Option I: Management by Objectives (MBO). MBO is a management approach where goals are set collaboratively between employees and management. It's about mutual goal-setting. The practical implementation here includes things like job simplification, job enrichment, suggestion plans, and job redesign. This directly relates because MBO involves employees in setting objectives, which aligns with the question's statement.

Option J: Expectancy Theory by Vroom. This theory is about the expectation of outcomes. It's implemented through clear communication of performance criteria and linking outcomes directly to performance. So if employees know that achieving certain performance will lead to rewards, they are motivated. But the question's statement is more about involvement in setting objectives, not just clear communication of outcomes.

Now, the question mentions that when a person contributes to setting objectives, they have more commitment and motivation. Management by Objectives (MBO) directly involves employees in setting goals with management, which is the theory in option I. The practical implementation includes various programs that engage employees, like job enrichment, which makes work more meaningful.

Looking back at the options, option I seems to fit because it's about mutual goal-setting and practical methods like job enrichment, which can boost motivation. Option G's Self-Determination Theory is also relevant because autonomy is a key factor, but the question is more about the process of setting objectives, which is MBO.

So the correct answer should be option I.
