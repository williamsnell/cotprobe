Answer:
    
<think>
Okay, so I've got this question about the Rayleigh distribution, and I need to find the expected value E[R], E[R²], and the variance σ². Hmm, I remember that the Rayleigh distribution is often used in communication theory and for wind speeds, I think. The density function is given as f(r) = (r / α²) e^(-r²/(2α²)) for r ≥ 0, and zero otherwise.

Alright, part (a) is E[R]. I know the expected value is the integral from 0 to infinity of r multiplied by the density function. So E[R] = ∫₀^∞ r * (r / α²) e^(-r²/(2α²)) dr. Let me write that out: E[R] = ∫₀^∞ (r² / α²) e^(-r²/(2α²)) dr.

Hmm, I think I can make a substitution here. Let me set x = r²/(2α²), so r² = 2α² x, and then dr would be sqrt(2α² x) dx? Wait, no, maybe better to let u = r²/(2α²). Then du/dr = (2r)/(2α²) = r/(α²), so r dr = α² du. Wait, but in the integral, I have r² * e^(-r²/(2α²)) dr. Let me see: r² is (2α² u), because r² = 2α² u. So substituting, the integral becomes ∫ (2α² u) e^{-u} * (α² du) )? Wait, no, wait. Let me do it step by step.

Let me try substitution u = r²/(2α²). Then r = α sqrt(2u), so dr = (α sqrt(2))/(2 sqrt(u)) du. Hmm, that might complicate things. Alternatively, maybe substitution t = r/(α√2), so r = α√2 t, dr = α√2 dt. Let's try that.

Then r² = (α² * 2 t²), and e^{-r²/(2α²)} becomes e^{-(α² * 2 t²)/(2α²)} = e^{-t²}. So the integral becomes ∫₀^∞ (α√2 t)² / α² * e^{-t²} * α√2 dt. Wait, wait, let's compute this step by step.

Wait, the original integrand is (r² / α²) e^{-r²/(2α²)}. Substituting r = α√2 t, so r² = 2 α² t². So r² / α² = 2 t². And e^{-r²/(2α²)} becomes e^{- (2 α² t²)/(2 α²)} = e^{-t²}.

So the integral becomes ∫ (2 t²) * e^{-t²} * (α√2 dt). Wait, because dr = α√2 dt. So putting it all together:

E[R] = ∫ (2 t²) e^{-t²} * α√2 dt, integrated from t=0 to t=∞.

So that's α√2 ∫ 2 t² e^{-t²} dt. I can factor out the 2: 2 α√2 ∫ t² e^{-t²} dt from 0 to ∞.

I remember that ∫ t² e^{-t²} dt from 0 to ∞ is (sqrt(π)/4) * something? Wait, no. Let me recall the standard integrals. The integral ∫ t^{2n} e^{-t²} dt from 0 to ∞ is (1*3*5*...*(2n-1)) * sqrt(π) ) / 2^{n+1} }.

For n=1, that's (1) * sqrt(π) / 4. So ∫ t² e^{-t²} dt from 0 to ∞ is (sqrt(π)/4) * 1. Wait, wait, 2n=2, so n=1. So yes, the integral is (1) * sqrt(π) / (2^{2}) ) = sqrt(π)/4.

So E[R] = 2 α√2 * (sqrt(π)/4) ) = (2 * sqrt(2) * sqrt(π)) / 4 ) α = (sqrt(2) * sqrt(π)) / 2 ) α.

Wait, sqrt(2)*sqrt(π) is sqrt(2π), so this becomes sqrt(2π)/2 * α, which is α * sqrt(π/2). So E[R] = α sqrt(π/2). Let me check the options.

Looking at the options, option F says E[R] = sqrt(π/2) α, which matches. Option A says E[R] is sqrt(π) α / 2, which is the same as α sqrt(π)/2. Wait, sqrt(π/2) is sqrt(π)/sqrt(2), which is about 1.253, whereas sqrt(π)/2 is about 0.886. So option F's E[R] is sqrt(π/2) α, which is what I got.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in substitution. Let me check the substitution again.

Wait, I set t = r/(α√2), so r = α√2 t. Then, r² = 2 α² t². So (r²)/(2α²) = t². So e^{-r²/(2α²)} = e^{-t²}. Then, dr = α√2 dt.

So the integral for E[R] is ∫ (r²/α²) e^{-r²/(2α²)} dr from 0 to ∞.

Substituting, (2α² t²)/α² = 2 t². So 2 t². Then, e^{-t²}, and dr is α√2 dt. So the integral becomes ∫ (2 t²) e^{-t²} * α√2 dt from 0 to ∞.

That's 2 * α√2 ∫ t² e^{-t²} dt. The integral ∫ t² e^{-t²} dt from 0 to ∞ is sqrt(π)/4. So 2 * α√2 * (sqrt(π)/4) = (2 * sqrt(2) * sqrt(π)) /4 ) α = (sqrt(2π)/2) α, which is α sqrt(π/2). So yes, E[R] = α sqrt(π/2). So that's option F, I think. Let me check the options.

Looking at the options: 

Option F: E[R] = [sqrt(π/2)] α, E[R²] = 2α², σ_r² = α²(0.43). Wait, but I'll come back to E[R²] and variance later.

Wait, but let me make sure. Another way to compute E[R] is using the gamma function. The Rayleigh distribution is a special case of the chi distribution, or more generally, the gamma distribution. The expected value for a gamma distribution is kβ, where k is the shape parameter and β is the scale parameter. For the Rayleigh distribution, the pdf is (r/(α²)) e^{-r²/(2α²)}, which is similar to a gamma distribution with shape parameter k=2, because the gamma pdf is (λ^k r^{k-1} e^{-λ r}) ) / Γ(k). Comparing, for gamma, the exponent is -λ r, but in Rayleigh it's -r²/(2α²). So maybe λ r = r²/(2α²), which would imply λ = r/(2α²), but that seems more complicated. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the chi distribution, where for two degrees of freedom, the pdf is (r/α²) e^{-r²/(2α²)}, which fits, so the expected value for a chi distribution with ν=2 is α sqrt(2/π) * something? Wait, no, I think for chi distribution with ν degrees of freedom, E[R] = sqrt(2) α Γ((ν+1)/2)/Γ(ν/2). For ν=2, (ν+1)/2=3/2, Γ(3/2)= (1/2) sqrt(π), and Γ(1)=1. So E[R] would be sqrt(2) α * (sqrt(π)/2) ) = alpha sqrt(π/2), which matches what I found earlier. So that's correct.

Now part (b): E[R²]. That's the integral of r² f(r) dr from 0 to ∞. So E[R²] = ∫₀^∞ r² (r/(α²)) e^{-r²/(2α²)} dr. Wait, no: f(r) is (r/α²) e^{-r²/(2α²)}, so E[R²] = ∫ r² * (r/α²) e^{-r²/(2α²)} dr. Wait, no, no: E[R²] is the integral of r² times f(r), so that's ∫ r² (r/α²) e^{-r²/(2α²)} dr. Wait, no, wait. No, wait: E[R²] is ∫ r² * f(r) dr. f(r) is (r/α²) e^{-r²/(2α²)}. So the integrand is r² * (r/α²) e^{-r²/(2α²)}, which simplifies to (r³ / α²) e^{-r²/(2α²)}. Hmm, that seems a bit more involved.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to compute E[R²] using the moment generating function or by recognizing it from the variance. Wait, because the variance is E[R²] - (E[R])².

Alternatively, perhaps there's a substitution I can use here. Let me try the substitution x = r²/(2α²), so r = α sqrt(2x), dr = (α sqrt(2))/(2 sqrt(x)) dx. Then, r² = 2 α² x, and r³ = (2 α² x)^(3/2) = 2^(3/2) α^3 x^(3/2). Maybe that's manageable.

So plugging into E[R²] = ∫₀^∞ (r^3 / α²) e^{-r²/(2α²)} dr = ∫ ( (2^(3/2) α^3 x^(3/2)) / α² ) e^{-x} * (α sqrt(2))/(2 sqrt(x)) dx ) from x=0 to x=∞.

Wait, let me compute each part:

r³ = (α sqrt(2x))³ = α^3 (2x)^(3/2) = α^3 2^(3/2) x^(3/2).

Then, divided by α²: (r³ / α²) = α 2^(3/2) x^(3/2).

Multiply by e^{-x}.

Multiply by dr, which is (α sqrt(2))/(2 sqrt(x)) dx.

So putting it all together:

E[R²] = ∫ ( α 2^(3/2) x^(3/2) ) * e^{-x} * (α sqrt(2))/(2 sqrt(x)) dx )

Simplify the terms:

α * 2^(3/2) * α sqrt(2) / 2 * x^(3/2) / sqrt(x) * e^{-x} dx.

Wait, let's compute the coefficients:

2^(3/2) is 2 * sqrt(2).

So α * 2 * sqrt(2) * alpha * sqrt(2) / 2.

Wait, the sqrt(2) in numerator and denominator will combine:

sqrt(2) * sqrt(2) = 2, so:

alpha * 2 * (2) * alpha / 2 = alpha^2 * 2 * 2 / 2 = 2 alpha^2.

Wait, let's compute step by step:

Coefficient: alpha * 2^(3/2) * alpha * sqrt(2) / 2.

2^(3/2) is sqrt(8) = 2.828 approx, but exact form is 2 * sqrt(2).

So 2^(3/2) = 2 * sqrt(2). So:

alpha * (2 * sqrt(2)) * alpha * sqrt(2) / 2.

= alpha^2 * (2 * sqrt(2) * sqrt(2)) ) / 2.

sqrt(2)*sqrt(2)=2, so 2*2=4.

So 4 / 2 = 2.

So coefficient is 2 alpha^2.

Now the x terms: x^(3/2) / sqrt(x) = x^(3/2 - 1/2) = x^1 = x.

So the integral becomes 2 alpha^2 ∫ x e^{-x} dx from 0 to ∞.

The integral ∫ x e^{-x} dx from 0 to ∞ is 1! = 1.

So E[R²] = 2 alpha^2 * 1 = 2 alpha^2.

Wait, that's interesting. So E[R²] is 2 alpha^2. Let me check that again. Alternatively, I can think about the variance of the Rayleigh distribution. I remember that the variance for Rayleigh is alpha^2 (pi/2 - 1). Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing it up with other distributions.

Wait, let me compute the variance as Var(R) = E[R²] - (E[R])².

From part (a), E[R] = alpha sqrt(pi/2). So (E[R])² = alpha² (pi/2).

If E[R²] is 2 alpha^2, then Var(R) = 2 alpha^2 - (pi/2) alpha^2 = alpha^2 (2 - pi/2) = alpha^2 (4 - pi)/2.

Wait, is that correct? Let me check with known values. I think the variance of the Rayleigh distribution is alpha^2 (pi/2 - 1). Hmm, but according to the calculation, I'm getting Var(R) = alpha^2 (4 - pi)/2. Wait, that's different.

Wait, I must have made a mistake somewhere. Let me redo the calculation for E[R²].

Wait, E[R²] is the integral ∫ r² f(r) dr, which is ∫ r² (r/(alpha²)) e^{-r²/(2 alpha²)} dr.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the substitution. Let me try a different substitution. Let me set t = r^2/(2 alpha^2), so r = alpha sqrt(2t), dr = alpha sqrt(2)/(2 sqrt(t)) dt.

Then r^2 = 2 alpha^2 t, and r^3 = (2 alpha^2 t)^{3/2} = 2^{3/2} alpha^3 t^{3/2}.

So, E[R²] = ∫ (r^3 / alpha^2) e^{-r^2/(2 alpha^2)} dr.

Substituting:

r^3 / alpha^2 = (2^{3/2} alpha^3 t^{3/2}) / alpha^2 = 2^{3/2} alpha t^{3/2}.

Then e^{-r^2/(2 alpha^2)} = e^{-t}.

dr = alpha sqrt(2)/(2 sqrt(t)) dt.

So putting it all together:

E[R²] = ∫ (2^{3/2} alpha t^{3/2}) * e^{-t} * (alpha sqrt(2)/(2 sqrt(t))) dt.

Simplify the coefficients:

2^{3/2} * alpha * alpha * sqrt(2) / 2 = 2^{3/2} * sqrt(2) * alpha^2 / 2.

2^{3/2} is 2 * sqrt(2), so 2 * sqrt(2) * sqrt(2) = 2 * 2 =4.

4 / 2 = 2. So coefficient is 2 alpha^2.

Now, t^{3/2} / sqrt(t) = t^{(3/2 - 1/2)} = t^{1} = t.

So the integral becomes 2 alpha^2 ∫ t e^{-t} dt from 0 to ∞.

∫ t e^{-t} dt is 1! = 1. So E[R²] = 2 alpha^2 * 1 = 2 alpha^2.

Hmm, that's what I got before. So variance is E[R²] - (E[R])² = 2 alpha^2 - (alpha^2 pi/2) ) = alpha^2 (2 - pi/2) = alpha^2 (4 - pi)/2.

Wait, but I thought the variance of Rayleigh was alpha^2 (pi/2 - 1). Let me check the formula for Rayleigh variance. Oh wait, perhaps I was confusing with the chi distribution. For chi distribution with ν=2, the variance is 2 alpha^2 - (E[R])^2.

Wait, from the Rayleigh distribution, the variance is given by Var(R) = alpha^2 ( (pi/2) - 1 ). Wait, that would be Var(R) = E[R²] - (E[R])^2 = ?

If E[R²] is 2 alpha^2 and (E[R])² is (alpha sqrt(pi/2))^2 = alpha^2 (pi/2), then Var(R) = 2 alpha^2 - (pi/2) alpha^2 = alpha^2 (2 - pi/2) = alpha^2 (4 - pi)/2.

Hmm, but I thought the variance of Rayleigh is alpha^2 (pi/2 - 1). Let me check with a source. [Imagining checking a textbook or notes.]

Wait, I think I might have made a mistake in the substitution for E[R²]. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute E[R²] in another way.

Alternatively, since the Rayleigh distribution is related to the chi-squared distribution, maybe I can use that to find moments.

Wait, another approach: For the Rayleigh distribution, the pdf is f(r) = (r/(alpha^2)) e^{-r²/(2 alpha^2)} for r ≥0.

The nth moment E[R^n] is given by the integral from 0 to ∞ of r^n (r/(alpha^2)) e^{-r²/(2 alpha^2)} dr.

Which is (1/alpha^2) ∫ r^{n+1} e^{-r²/(2 alpha^2)} dr from 0 to ∞.

Using substitution t = r^2/(2 alpha^2), so r = alpha sqrt(2t), dr = alpha sqrt(2)/(2 sqrt(t)) dt.

Then, r^{n+1} = (alpha sqrt(2t))^{n+1} = alpha^{n+1} (2t)^{(n+1)/2}.

So the integral becomes:

(1/alpha^2) * integral from t=0 to ∞ of [alpha^{n+1} (2t)^{(n+1)/2} ] * e^{-t} * [alpha sqrt(2)/(2 sqrt(t))] dt.

Simplify:

= (1/alpha^2) * alpha^{n+1} * (2)^{(n+1)/2} * alpha sqrt(2)/(2) ) * ∫ t^{(n+1)/2} * e^{-t} * t^{-1/2} dt.

Wait, because (2t)^{(n+1)/2} is 2^{(n+1)/2} t^{(n+1)/2}, and sqrt(t) is t^{1/2}, so when we divide by sqrt(t), it's t^{-1/2}.

So exponents on t: (n+1)/2 - 1/2 = (n)/2.

So the integral becomes:

(1/alpha^2) * alpha^{n+1} * (2)^{(n+1)/2} * (alpha sqrt(2)/2) ) * ∫ t^{n/2} e^{-t} dt.

Let me compute the constants:

(1/alpha^2) * alpha^{n+1} = alpha^{n-1}.

(2)^{(n+1)/2} * (sqrt(2)/2) = 2^{(n+1)/2} * 2^{1/2} / 2 = 2^{(n+1 +1)/2} / 2 = 2^{(n+2)/2} / 2 = 2^{(n+2)/2 - 1}.

So overall, the constants are:

alpha^{n-1} * 2^{(n+2)/2 -1}.

And the integral is ∫ t^{n/2} e^{-t} dt from 0 to ∞, which is Gamma((n/2)+1).

So putting it all together:

E[R^n] = alpha^{n-1} * 2^{(n+2)/2 -1} * Gamma((n/2)+1).

For n=1:

E[R] = alpha^{0} * 2^{(1+2)/2 -1} * Gamma(1 + 1/2).

Gamma(3/2) is (1/2) sqrt(pi).

So:

E[R] = 1 * 2^{(3/2)-1} * (1/2) sqrt(pi) = 2^{1/2} * (1/2) sqrt(pi) = (sqrt(2)/2) sqrt(pi) ) = sqrt(pi/2) alpha. Which matches part (a).

For n=2:

E[R²] = alpha^{1} * 2^{(2+2)/2 -1} * Gamma(2/2 +1) = alpha * 2^{2 -1} * Gamma(2) = alpha * 2 * 1! = 2 alpha.

So that's correct, E[R²] = 2 alpha^2. So yes, that's correct.

So the variance Var(R) = E[R²] - (E[R])^2 = 2 alpha^2 - (alpha^2 pi/2) = alpha^2 (2 - pi/2) = alpha^2 (4 - pi)/2.

Wait, but I thought the variance for Rayleigh was alpha^2 (pi/2 - 1). Hmm, perhaps I was mistaken earlier. Let me see: (4 - pi)/2 is approximately (4 -3.1416)/2 = (0.8584)/2 ≈ 0.4292, which is about 0.43 alpha^2. So option F says σ_r² = alpha^2 (0.43), which would correspond to (4 - pi)/2 alpha^2 ≈ 0.429 alpha^2.

So let's check the options again.

Option F: E[R] = sqrt(pi/2) alpha, E[R^2] = 2 alpha^2, σ_r² = alpha^2 (0.43). So that matches.

Option J: E[R] = alpha sqrt(2/pi), E[R^2] = 3 alpha^2 / 2, σ_r² = alpha^2 (1 - 2/pi). Hmm, that doesn't match what I have.

Wait, let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in calculating the variance. Because the variance for Rayleigh distribution is known to be alpha^2 ( (pi/2) - 1 ). Let me compute that: pi/2 is about 1.5708, so 1.5708 -1 = 0.5708. So variance would be 0.5708 alpha^2. But according to my calculation, I have 2 alpha^2 - (pi/2) alpha^2 = alpha^2 (2 - pi/2) ≈ 2 - 1.5708 = 0.4292 alpha^2, which is about 0.43 alpha^2. So which is correct?

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing with the chi distribution. The Rayleigh distribution is a special case of the chi distribution with two degrees of freedom. The variance for chi distribution with ν=2 is 2 alpha^2 - (E[R])^2. Wait, no, the variance for chi distribution is ν alpha^2 ( (1 - 2/(ν+2)) ) or something? Maybe I should look it up.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula Var(R) = E[R²] - (E[R])^2. Since I have E[R²] = 2 alpha^2 and E[R] = alpha sqrt(pi/2). So (E[R])^2 = alpha^2 (pi/2). Thus, Var(R) = 2 alpha^2 - (pi/2) alpha^2 = alpha^2 (2 - pi/2) = (4 - pi)/2 alpha^2 ≈ (4 -3.1416)/2 ≈ 0.8584/2 ≈ 0.4292 alpha^2, which is about 0.43 alpha^2 as before.

So according to this, the variance is approximately 0.43 alpha^2. So in the options, option F says σ_r² = alpha^2 (0.43), which matches. Option H says σ_r² = (4 - pi)/2 alpha^2, but looking at option H, it says σ_r² = (4 - pi) alpha^2/2, which is exactly what I have. Wait, option H: σ_r² = (4 - pi) alpha² / 2. Let me check option H.

Option H: E[R] = alpha^2, E[R²] = (2/3) alpha^2, σ_r² = (4 - pi) alpha² /2.

Wait, no, option H says E[R] = alpha², which is different from what I found. So option H is not correct.

Wait, let's look back at the options. 

Option F: E[R] = [sqrt(π/2)] alpha, E[R²] = 2 alpha², σ_r² = alpha²(0.43).

Option H: E[R] = alpha², E[R²] = (2/3) alpha², σ_r² = (4 - pi) alpha²/2.

So, option H's E[R²] doesn't match, so option F is correct for E[R] and E[R²], and σ_r² is approximately 0.43 alpha², which matches option F.

Wait, but option J: E[R] = alpha sqrt(2/pi), E[R²] = 3 alpha²/2, σ_r² = alpha² (1 - 2/pi).

Let me compute 1 - 2/pi: approximately 1 - 0.6366 = 0.3634, which is about 0.363 alpha². That doesn't match our variance of ~0.429 alpha².

So, based on the calculations, the correct option is F: E[R] = sqrt(π/2) alpha, E[R²] = 2 alpha², σ_r² = alpha²(0.43).
</think>

The Rayleigh distribution's expected value \( E[R] \) is calculated using the integral \( \int_0^\infty r \cdot f(r) \, dr \), where \( f(r) \) is the given density function. By substituting \( t = r / (\alpha \sqrt{2}) \), the integral simplifies to \( \alpha \sqrt{\pi / 2} \). For \( E[R^2] \), the integral \( \int_0^\infty r^2 \cdot f(r) \, dr \) evaluates to \( 2\alpha^2 \). The variance \( \sigma^2 \) is then \( E[R^2] - (E[R])^2 \), resulting in \( \alpha^2(4 - \pi)/2 \approx 0.43\alpha^2 \). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**F: \( E[R] = \alpha\sqrt{\pi/2} \), \( E[R^2] = 2\alpha^2 \), \( \sigma_r^2 = \alpha^2(0.43) \).**

Answer: F
