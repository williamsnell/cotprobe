Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about what a user auditor should include in their audit plan when the audit client uses a service organization for several processes. I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think it through carefully.

First, I remember that when a company relies on a service organization, like maybe a vendor or a third-party provider, for certain processes, the auditor needs to assess the risks involved. The idea is to make sure that the controls in place are effective because they affect the client's financial statements.

The question is asking which procedure is the most efficient. So, the options are A to J. Let me go through them one by one.

Option A says to rely solely on the service auditor's report without any additional review or testing. That doesn't sound right because relying solely might mean missing some issues. Auditors shouldn't just take the report at face value; they should probably do some checks.

Option B suggests reviewing the service organization's controls and auditing the client's internal controls. This seems plausible because both the service provider's controls and the client's internal controls are important. The auditor needs to understand both to assess risks accurately.

Option C advises ignoring the service organization's processes. That can't be right because if the service organization's processes are integral to the client's operations, ignoring them would leave gaps in the audit.

Option D is about auditing the client's internal controls without considering the service auditor's report. But if the service organization is handling key processes, the auditor should definitely look at their controls as well, not ignore them.

Option E says to audit the service organization's operations without reviewing their report. That might be redundant because if the service auditor has already done a report, the client auditor could use that information instead of doing a full audit themselves.

Option F suggests reviewing the service auditor's report on controls. That makes sense because the service auditor would have assessed their own controls, and the client's auditor can use that information as part of their plan.

Option G is similar to F but says to review the service organization's controls without considering their report. That seems less efficient because why review the controls again if the service auditor has already done it?

Option H is about auditing the service organization’s controls to test the service auditor's work. That might be necessary, but is it the most efficient? Maybe it's better to review the report first.

Option I says to review the service auditor’s report and outline the accounting system in a memo. That could be part of the process, but is it the main procedure needed for the audit plan?

Option J suggests auditing the service organization’s controls, assessing risk, and preparing the audit plan. This sounds comprehensive. It involves looking at the service controls, evaluating the risks they pose to the client's financial statements, and then planning the audit accordingly.

So, putting it all together, the auditor needs to understand the service organization's controls because they impact the client's processes. Reviewing the service auditor's report (Option F) is a step, but Option J includes not just reviewing the report but also assessing risk and planning the audit, which seems more efficient and thorough.

Wait, but Option B also includes reviewing the service controls and auditing the client's internal controls. That might be a good approach too. But Option J seems to encapsulate a more complete process: audit the service controls, assess risk, and plan the audit. That would lead to a more efficient audit because it addresses the key areas without unnecessary duplication.

I think I'm leaning towards Option J because it covers auditing the service controls, which are relevant, assessing the risks they pose, and then preparing the audit plan based on that. This approach would help the auditor focus on high-risk areas and allocate resources efficiently.

The most efficient procedure for a user auditor when the audit client uses a service organization is to audit the service organization’s controls, assess the associated risks, and prepare the audit plan accordingly. This approach ensures that the auditor thoroughly understands the service controls and their impact on the client's financial statements, leading to an efficient and effective audit process.

Answer: J
