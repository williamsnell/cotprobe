Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.

The question is asking: How many unique numbers can be made from creating a fraction where both the numerator and the denominator can be any of the numbers 2, 3, 4, or 6. So, I need to consider all possible fractions where each part is one of those four numbers and then count how many unique values there are.

Hmm, right. So, first, I should probably list out all possible fractions. Since there are four choices for the numerator and four for the denominator, that makes 4 x 4 = 16 possible fractions. But of course, some of these fractions might simplify to the same value, so I need to see which ones are duplicates.

Let me start by writing down each possible fraction. The numerators can be 2, 3, 4, 6, and the denominators can be 2, 3, 4, 6. So, I'll list them systematically:

1. 2/2
2. 2/3
3. 2/4
4. 2/6
5. 3/2
6. 3/3
7. 3/4
8. 3/6
9. 4/2
10. 4/3
11. 4/4
12. 4/6
13. 6/2
14. 6/3
15. 6/4
16. 6/6

Now, I need to simplify each of these fractions and see which ones are unique.

Starting with the first one: 2/2 = 1.

Next, 2/3 cannot be simplified further, so it's 2/3.

2/4 simplifies to 1/2.

2/6 simplifies to 1/3.

3/2 is already in simplest form.

3/3 = 1.

3/4 is already simplified.

3/6 simplifies to 1/2.

4/2 = 2.

4/3 is simplified.

4/4 = 1.

4/6 simplifies to 2/3.

6/2 = 3.

6/3 = 2.

6/4 simplifies to 3/2.

6/6 = 1.

Now, let me list all these simplified forms:

1. 1
2. 2/3
3. 1/2
4. 1/3
5. 3/2
6. 1
7. 3/4
8. 1/2
9. 2
10. 4/3
11. 1
12. 2/3
13. 3
14. 2
15. 3/2
16. 1

Now, let's collect all unique values. I'll list them as I find them.

1 appears multiple times (from 2/2, 3/3, 4/4, 6/6), so that's one unique number.

2/3 appears twice (fractions 2 and 12), so that's another unique number.

1/2 appears twice (fractions 3 and 8), so that's another unique.

1/3 appears once (fraction 4), so that's a third unique.

3/2 appears twice (fractions 5 and 15), so that's another unique.

3/4 appears once (fraction 7), so that's another.

4/3 appears once (fraction 10), so that's another.

2 appears twice (fractions 9 and 14), so that's another unique.

3 appears once (fraction 13), so that's another.

So, let me count them:

1. 1
2. 2/3
3. 1/2
4. 1/3
5. 3/2
6. 3/4
7. 4/3
8. 2
9. 3

Wait, that's nine unique numbers so far. But let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss any or count any extra.

Looking back at the simplified list:

Fractions 1,6,11,16: all 1s. So count 1 as one.

Fractions 2 and 12: both 2/3. Count as one.

Fractions 3 and 8: both 1/2. Count as one.

Fraction 4: 1/3. New.

Fraction 5 and 15: 3/2. Count as one.

Fraction 7: 3/4. New.

Fraction 10: 4/3. New.

Fraction 9 and 14: both 2. Count as one.

Fraction 13: 3. New.

So, total unique fractions: 9.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me make sure I didn't miss any. Let me list all the unique values again.

1, 2/3, 1/2, 1/3, 3/2, 3/4, 4/3, 2, 3.

That's nine different values. So the answer should be 9, which is option G.

But wait, let me check if I missed any. Are there any other fractions that might have simplified differently?

Wait, let's see:

Looking at 4/6: that's 2/3.

6/4: that's 3/2.

Yes, I think I accounted for all of them correctly.

So, the total unique numbers are 9. So the correct answer is G: 9.

The unique fractions obtained are 1, 2/3, 1/2, 1/3, 3/2, 3/4, 4/3, 2, and 3, totaling 9 unique numbers.

Answer: G
