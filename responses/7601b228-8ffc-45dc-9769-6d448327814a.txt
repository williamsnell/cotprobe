Okay, so I've got this question about calculating how many calories are needed to heat water. Let me think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my physics, but I remember some basics.

The question is: How many calories of heat are required to raise 1,000 grams of water from 10°C to 100°C? The options are A through J, with various numbers.

First, I recall that the formula for calculating the heat required to change the temperature of a substance is Q = m * c * ΔT. Here, Q is the heat, m is mass, c is specific heat capacity, and ΔT is the change in temperature.

Water has a specific heat capacity of 1 calorie per gram per degree Celsius. I think that's right—so c = 1 cal/(g·°C). Wait, actually, in some contexts, people use kilocalories, but I think here it's calories as in small calories, since the options are in thousands and not millions.

The mass given is 1,000 grams, which is 1 kilogram. But since the specific heat is per gram, I'll keep it as 1000 grams.

The temperature change, ΔT, is from 10°C to 100°C. So that's 100 - 10 = 90°C.

Putting it all together: Q = 1000 g * 1 cal/(g·°C) * 90°C. Let's calculate that.

1000 * 1 is 1000, and 1000 * 90 is 90,000. So Q = 90,000 calories.

Looking at the options, option H is 90,000 calories. So that should be the correct answer.

Wait, but I should double-check. Did I use the right specific heat? Yes, water is 1 cal/(g·°C). Did I calculate the temperature change correctly? 100 -10 is 90, that's right. Mass is 1000 grams. So 1000 * 1 *90 =90,000. Yep, that's correct.

To calculate the heat required to raise the temperature of 1,000 grams of water from 10°C to 100°C, use the formula:

\[ Q = m \times c \times \Delta T \]

Where:
- \( m = 1000 \, \text{g} \)
- \( c = 1 \, \text{cal/(g·°C)} \) (specific heat of water)
- \( \Delta T = 100 - 10 = 90 \, \text{°C} \)

Substituting the values:

\[ Q = 1000 \times 1 \times 90 = 90,000 \, \text{calories} \]

Thus, the correct answer is H.
