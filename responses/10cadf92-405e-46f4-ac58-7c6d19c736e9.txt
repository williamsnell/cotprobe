Question:

Under which of the following situations would the defendant most likely be found guilty of murder?

Options:

A: A defendant was speeding on a public highway, well over the speed limit. He saw a child chasing after a ball onto the road, but he was unable to stop or swerve in time and ended up hitting the child, causing fatal injuries.
B: A defendant was driving home after drinking heavily at a party. He lost control of his vehicle and crashed into a house, killing the resident who was sleeping inside.
C: A defendant, out hunting with a friend, mistook his friend for a deer and shot him, resulting in his friend's death.
D: A defendant was showing off his new gun to his friends at a party. He thought the gun was not loaded and playfully pointed it at a friend and pulled the trigger, resulting in his friend's death.
E: A defendant, accompanied by his girlfriend, was attending his law school graduation party. Both the defendant and his girlfriend became highly intoxicated during the party celebration. As the defendant and his girlfriend were leaving the party, the defendant handed his girlfriend the keys to his automobile and directed her to drive home. While driving, the girlfriend suddenly swerved the car across the median strip into the path of an oncoming car, killing the driver of the other vehicle.
F: One afternoon a defendant was delivering pornographic materials to various adult bookstores in the community. In this jurisdiction, the delivery of pornographic materials constituted a misdemeanor. As the defendant was on his way to a book store for his final delivery of the day, he inadvertently struck a blind man who was crossing an intersection. Six months later, the blind man died as a result of injuries suffered in the accident.
G: A defendant, while arguing with his spouse at home, pulled out a gun. The gun accidentally discharged and the bullet struck and killed their child who had just entered the room.
H: A defendant was involved in a heated argument with a coworker. In a fit of rage, he struck his coworker on the head with a heavy object, resulting in his coworker's death.
I: A defendant conspired with two other men to rob a store. On the day of the robbery, the three participants drove to the store in a stolen van. In accordance with their plan, the defendant was to wait in the getaway van while the two men conducted their heist. While the two men were inside the store, the defendant decided to renounce his involvement and participation in the scheme and hurriedly drove away in the van. In his haste, the defendant failed to see a pedesthan jaywalking across the street, and struck and killed the pedestrian.
J: A defendant, whose driver's license had been revoked one week previously, was driving on an infrequently traveled country road one night. Knowing that his car brakes were defective, the defendant was traveling at 35 m. p. h. in a zone in which the speed limit was 25 m. p. h. when a victim suddenly darted in front of his car. In an effort to avoid striking the victim, the defendant applied his brakes to no avail. The car struck and killed the victim.

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about criminal law, specifically murder. I'm trying to figure out which option would most likely lead to a conviction for murder. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I remember that murder typically involves an unlawful killing with malice aforethought. Malice can be express or implied. Express malice is when someone intends to kill, while implied malice can come from actions that show a wanton disregard for human life, like during felony murder or when using a deadly weapon in a way that's inherently dangerous.

Looking at each option:

A: The defendant was speeding, saw a child, couldn't stop, and hit them fatally. Speeding is a misdemeanor, but causing death while speeding could be manslaughter, not murder, unless it's shown to be with extreme recklessness. But I'm not sure if it meets the malice standard for murder.

B: The defendant drove after drinking, lost control, crashed into a house, killing someone. This sounds like manslaughter because it's caused by a criminally negligent act while driving under the influence. DUIs often lead to manslaughter charges if someone dies, not necessarily murder unless there's more.

C: Mistook a friend for a deer and shot him. This could be manslaughter because it was an accident due to a reasonable mistake. Unless the defendant was being reckless, but hunting typically requires some care, so maybe it's involuntary manslaughter.

D: Thought the gun wasn't loaded, pointed it at a friend, and it discharged. Again, this seems like an accident, so probably manslaughter. Unless there's a reason to think he should have known it was loaded.

E: Defendant and his intoxicated girlfriend drove home, she crashed. The defendant gave her the keys, knowing she was drunk. If he knew she was too intoxicated to drive safely, he could be liable as an accomplice if her driving was negligent, but I'm not sure if that's murder. It might be manslaughter if his action was criminally negligent.

F: Misdemeanor delivery of porn led to hitting a blind man, who died six months later. Misdemeanors usually don't count in felony murder unless it's a felony. So this might be manslaughter or maybe not criminal at all, depending on the jurisdiction.

G: During an argument, the gun discharged accidentally, killing their child. This could be manslaughter, maybe even involuntary, because it was a tragic accident during an argument, not intentional.

H: Heated argument, struck coworker on the head with a heavy object, causing death. This seems like intentional killing, so it's murder because it shows express malice. He intended to cause serious harm, leading to death.

I: Conspiracy to rob, defendant tried to leave but hit a pedestrian. If the robbery counts as a felony, then under felony murder, he could be guilty even if he tried to back out. So if the robbery is a felony, this might be felony murder, making him guilty.

J: Revoked driver's license, defective brakes, speeding, hit someone. His reckless driving could be considered malice, especially if he was speeding and knew the brakes were bad. This might be murder because his actions showed a wanton disregard for safety, maybe meeting the malice standard.

So, looking for which is most likely to be murder. Option H is intentional, so definitely murder. Option I is felony murder if the robbery is a felony. Option J might be murder due to reckless driving with a revoked license and defective brakes, showing extreme recklessness.

Wait, felony murder in I: the defendant was part of a robbery, which is a felony. Even if he tried to leave, his initial participation makes him liable. So I think I is murder.

Similarly, J could be murder because of the reckless driving leading to death. But which is more likely?

H is clear because it's an intentional act with a heavy object, causing death. That's express malice. I is felony murder, which is also murder. But J might be murder under the felony of reckless driving, but I'm not sure if that's a felony. Alternatively, it's murder under the theory of gross negligence.

Hmm, but the question is about the most likely. H is definitely murder because intent is clear. I and J might also be, but H is a sure thing.

The most likely situation for a murder conviction is when the defendant intentionally causes the death of another person. Option H describes a defendant striking a coworker with a heavy object during a heated argument, which demonstrates express malice aforethought, a clear element of murder.

Answer: H
