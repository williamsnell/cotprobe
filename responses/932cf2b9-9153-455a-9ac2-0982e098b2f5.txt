The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

A telephone executive instructs an associate to contact 104 customers using their service to obtain their opinions in regard to an idea for a new pricing package. The associate notes the number of customers whose names begin with A and uses a random number table to pick four of these names. She then proceeds to use the same procedure for each letter of the alphabet and combines the 4 Ã— 26 = 104 results into a group to be contacted. Which of the following is a correct conclusion?

Options:

A: Her procedure introduces bias through non-sampling error.
B: Her procedure results in a systematic sample.
C: Her procedure makes use of chance.
D: Her procedure ensures a representative sample of customer opinions.
E: Her procedure leads to a biased outcome due to the alphabetical selection process.
F: Her procedure results in a simple random sample.
G: Her procedure ensures every customer will be contacted.
H: Each customer has an equal probability of being included in the survey.
I: Her procedure introduces bias through sampling error.

Okay, let's try to work through this problem. So, the question is about a telephone executive who wants to contact 104 customers to get their opinions on a new pricing package. The associate is using a specific method to select these customers. I need to figure out which conclusion is correct based on the options given.

First, let me understand the procedure. The associate notes the number of customers whose names begin with each letter of the alphabet. Then, for each letter, she uses a random number table to pick four names. Since there are 26 letters, 4 times 26 equals 104, which matches the total number of customers she needs to contact. So she's selecting four customers for each starting letter and combining all of them into a group.

Now, I have to evaluate the options to see which one is correct. Let's go through each option one by one.

Option A: Her procedure introduces bias through non-sampling error. Non-sampling error refers to mistakes in the survey process, like bad question wording or non-response. But here, the problem is about the sampling method itself, not errors during data collection. So I don't think A is correct.

Option B: Her procedure results in a systematic sample. Systematic sampling is when you select every nth individual from a list. For example, choosing every 10th name. But in this case, the associate is picking four names for each starting letter, which doesn't follow a fixed interval. So B doesn't seem right.

Option C: Her procedure makes use of chance. Well, she's using a random number table to pick the names, which involves an element of chance. So this is a correct statement. But let me check other options to see if there's a better fit.

Option D: Her procedure ensures a representative sample of customer opinions. A representative sample would mirror the population in all aspects, including demographics. However, by grouping based on the first letter of the name, there might be an issue if, say, certain letters correspond to different demographics. For example, if more customers with names starting with 'A' are from a certain region, the sample might not be representative. But I'm not sure if this is about bias or just the method.

Option E: Her procedure leads to a biased outcome due to the alphabetical selection process. This is similar to what I was thinking with D. If the names are ordered alphabetically and she's selecting four from each, maybe the distribution isn't random. But wait, she's using a random number table within each group, so each starting letter's group is randomly selected. Unless there's a hidden bias in the way names are arranged alphabetically, I'm not sure if this introduces bias. Maybe E is correct, but I need to think more.

Option F: Her procedure results in a simple random sample. A simple random sample (SRS) is where every individual has an equal chance of being selected, and every subset of a certain size has an equal chance of being chosen. Here, she's dividing the population into 26 groups based on the first letter and then randomly selecting four from each. This might not be a simple random sample because the selection is stratified by the first letter. So F is probably incorrect.

Option G: Her procedure ensures every customer will be contacted. No, she's only selecting 104 customers out of presumably more than 104, so G is wrong.

Option H: Each customer has an equal probability of being included in the survey. Let's see. If she's selecting four from each of the 26 letters, the number of customers per letter might vary. For example, if there are 50 customers with names starting with 'A' and only 10 with 'Z', selecting four from each would mean that 'A' customers have a lower chance (4/50) compared to 'Z' customers (4/10). So the probability isn't equal for all customers. Therefore, H is incorrect.

Option I: Her procedure introduces bias through sampling error. Sampling error is the difference between the sample and population due to random chance, not bias. Bias would be systematic error. I'm not sure if her method introduces bias, but it might not be through sampling error. So I think I is incorrect.

Now, going back to the options, C says her procedure makes use of chance, which is true because she's using a random number table. But I'm also considering whether the sample is biased. From the analysis, since she's using random selection within each group, it should be unbiased, but the grouping by the first letter could potentially introduce issues if the letters correlate with other variables, but that's more about the stratification and not necessarily bias introduced by the sampling method itself.

Wait, but in the case where the population is divided into letters, and she's taking a random sample from each, it's a stratified random sample. Stratified sampling can reduce bias if the strata are homogeneous, but if the strata are heterogeneous, it might not. However, the problem doesn't indicate any issues with the strata themselves. So maybe her method is not introducing bias but is making use of chance (option C) and is a stratified sample, not a simple random sample.

But looking at the options, option E says it leads to a biased outcome due to alphabetical selection. I'm not entirely convinced because the selection within each group is random. Unless the alphabetical grouping itself introduces some form of bias, but the question doesn't provide information about the distribution of names across letters or any correlation with the variable of interest (opinions on pricing). So without that info, I'm not sure if E is correct. However, the method does use chance (C), so that's a correct conclusion.

Wait, another angle: when she picks four from each letter, if the number of customers per letter varies, some letters might have more selections. For example, if 'A' has 100 customers, selecting four would be 4% chance. If 'Z' has 5, selecting four would be 80% chance. So customers with names starting with less common letters have a higher chance of being selected. This would mean their probability isn't equal, so the sample isn't a simple random sample, but it's also not necessarily biased unless it affects the outcome. However, the question is about the procedure's correctness, not the outcome's bias.

So, among the options, C says it makes use of chance, which is correct because she's using a random number table. D says it ensures a representative sample, but without knowing the distribution, it's not guaranteed. E talks about bias due to alphabetical selection, which might not be the case if the selection within each group is random.

Therefore, the correct conclusions are C and maybe E, but I'm not entirely sure about E. But since the question asks which is a correct conclusion, and C is definitely correct, that's the answer.
</think>

The associate's procedure involves using a random number table to select four customers for each starting letter of the alphabet, resulting in a total of 104 customers. This method introduces an element of chance, as the selection within each group is random. However, it does not ensure equal probability for all customers, as the number of customers per starting letter may vary, leading to differing chances of selection. While the procedure does not guarantee a representative sample or eliminate bias entirely, the use of a random number table confirms that chance is involved.

Answer: C
