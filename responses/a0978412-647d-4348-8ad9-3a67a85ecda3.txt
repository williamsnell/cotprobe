Question:

This question refers to the following information.
The following quote is from Voltaire in response to the 1755 Lisbon earthquake.
My dear sir, nature is very cruel. One would find it hard to imagine how the laws of movement cause such frightful disasters in the best of possible worlds. A hundred thousand ants, our fellows, crushed all at once in our ant-hill, and half of them perishing, no doubt in unspeakable agony, beneath the wreckage from which they cannot be drawn. Families ruined all over Europe, the fortune of a hundred businessmen, your compatriots, swallowed up in the ruins of Lisbon. What a wretched gamble is the game of human life! What will the preachers say, especially if the palace of the Inquisition is still standing? I flatter myself that at least the reverend father inquisitors have been crushed like others. That ought to teach men not to persecute each other, for while a few holy scoundrels burn a few fanatics, the earth swallows up one and all.
—Voltaire, in a letter, 1755

Okay, so I have this question about the Enlightenment and the Romantic Movement. The question is asking which Enlightenment philosopher started questioning reliance on reason and began the Romantic Movement based on the rationale given in Voltaire's quote. 

First, I need to understand the context. The quote from Voltaire is about the 1755 Lisbon earthquake. He's talking about how nature is cruel, the suffering of people, and criticizes the Inquisition. He's clearly expressing a lot of emotion and questioning the idea that the world is the best possible, which was a response to Leibniz's optimistic view. Voltaire's letter seems to be a critique of the optimism of the time and the use of reason to explain such horrors.

The question is about who among the options questioned reason and started the Romantic Movement. The Romantic Movement was a reaction against the Enlightenment's emphasis on reason, logic, and science. It valued emotion, nature, and individualism.

Looking at the options:

A: Thomas Hobbes – He's more known for his social contract theory and the idea of the Leviathan. He thought humans were naturally selfish and cruel, but I'm not sure he started the Romantic Movement. He's earlier than the Enlightenment peak, maybe.

B: Jean-Jacques Rousseau – He did talk about society corrupting people, like in "Discourse on Inequality." He emphasized the noble savage idea, which is more emotional and critical of society. This seems relevant because he was a key figure in the Enlightenment but also contributed to Romanticism's ideas about nature and emotion.

C: Mary Wollstonecraft – She's an Enlightenment thinker who focused on women's rights. Her works are emotional, but I don't think she's directly linked to starting the Romantic Movement.

D: Denis Diderot – He was an encyclopedist, focusing on reason and enlightenment through knowledge. He might have believed in emotions, but I don't recall him being the one to question reason in a way that started Romanticism.

E: John Locke – He's more about empiricism and individual rights. His ideas were more about reason and the social contract, so probably not the one to question reason.

F: Immanuel Kant – He talked about the limits of reason, especially in his later works. He questioned whether reason alone could explain the universe but still maintained that reason was central. He's more of a bridge figure, but I'm not sure he's the one who began Romanticism.

G: Adam Smith – He's an economist, known for the "invisible hand." He discussed empathy in "The Theory of Moral Sentiments," but I don't think he's linked to starting the Romantic Movement.

H: Voltaire himself – He's the one who wrote the quote, but the question is asking which of the given options is the philosopher who questioned reason and started Romanticism. So it's not H, because the question is about someone else.

I: Baron Montesquieu – He wrote about the separation of powers. His ideas are more about government structure, not necessarily about emotion or questioning reason.

J: David Hume – He argued that reason is a slave to the passions. He emphasized that emotions and feelings drive human behavior more than reason. His skepticism about reason's role in making moral judgments could be a precursor to Romanticism, which valued emotion over reason.

Wait, so Voltaire's quote is about the horrors of nature and human suffering, questioning the optimism of the Enlightenment. The Romantic Movement arose partly in response to the Enlightenment's emphasis on reason. So the question is about who among the options started this shift by questioning reason.

Jean-Jacques Rousseau is often considered a key figure in the transition from Enlightenment to Romanticism. He criticized society and emphasized the individual and nature, which are Romantic themes. His work "Emile" and his ideas about the social contract reflect a move towards valuing emotion and individual experience over pure reason.

David Hume, on the other hand, did argue that reason is secondary to emotion, which is a Romantic idea. But Hume is more of an Enlightenment figure, though with some critical views on reason's limits. Rousseau is more directly associated with the shift towards Romanticism.

So, looking at the options, B is Rousseau because he thought society corrupted noble souls, which is a Romantic critique. He started questioning the Enlightenment's view of society and emphasized emotion and nature.

Therefore, the answer should be B.

The question asks which Enlightenment philosopher began questioning reliance on reason and started the Romantic Movement, as suggested by Voltaire's critique of nature's cruelty and human suffering in his letter about the Lisbon earthquake. The Romantic Movement reacted against the Enlightenment's emphasis on reason by valuing emotion, nature, and individualism.

Analyzing the options:

- **B: Jean-Jacques Rousseau** is the correct choice because he criticized society's corruption of natural goodness and emphasized individual experience and emotion, aligning with Romantic ideals. His work laid the groundwork for the shift from Enlightenment reason to Romanticism.

Answer: B
