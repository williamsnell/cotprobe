Question:

A man kidnapped a victim in State A and transported the victim across the state border into State B. These actions violated the kidnapping laws of both states, which are identical. A jury convicted the man in a State A court, but the trial judge gave what prosecutors in State B deemed an unduly lenient sentence. The state prosecutor in State B then commenced a kidnapping case against the man for violating State B's kidnapping statute. The man's lawyer has filed a motion in State B to dismiss the charge based on the double jeopardy protection against a second prosecution for the man's single act of kidnapping. Should the court grant the motion to dismiss?

Options:

A: No, because the man committed two separate acts of kidnapping, one in each state.
B: Yes, because the man was already tried and convicted for the same crime in State A.
C: Yes, because the double jeopardy protection applies to both state and federal laws.
D: No, because the man's conduct violated the laws of two different states, and each has the right to enforce its laws. right to enforce its laws.
E: No, because the double jeopardy protection only applies to federal law.
F: Yes, because the double jeopardy protection applies even when laws of different states are identical.
G: No, because the man's sentence in State A was deemed unduly lenient in State B.
H: Yes, because the government is collaterally estopped under the double jeopardy protection from prosecuting a defendant a second time for the same conduct that led to an earlier conviction.
I: Yes, because the double jeopardy protection prohibits a second prosecution following a conviction for the same offense.
J: No, because the double jeopardy protection only prohibits a second prosecution following an acquittal for the same offense.

Okay, so I have this question about double jeopardy, and I need to figure out whether the court should grant the motion to dismiss. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the scenario: A man kidnapped a victim in State A and took them to State B. Both states have identical kidnapping laws. He was convicted in State A, but the sentence was too lenient according to State B's prosecutors. Now, State B is prosecuting him again under their kidnapping statute.

The question is about whether double jeopardy applies here. I remember that double jeopardy is meant to protect someone from being tried twice for the same offense. But I'm a bit fuzzy on how it works between different states.

I think about the double jeopardy clause in the Fifth Amendment. It says you can't be tried twice for the same offense after jeopardy has attached. But wait, this applies to the same sovereign, right? So if it's the same state, then yes, double jeopardy applies. But here, we're dealing with two different states: State A and State B.

So, if the states are different sovereigns, then each can prosecute for the same act without violating double jeopardy. Because each state has its own set of laws and the authority to enforce them. So, the fact that the laws are identical shouldn't matter because they're separate sovereigns.

Let me think about the options. The options are from A to J. Looking at the options:

Option B says yes because he was tried and convicted in State A. But wait, double jeopardy doesn't prevent another state from prosecuting. So B might not be correct.

Option D says no because the conduct violated two states' laws, so each can enforce their laws. That makes sense because each state is a separate sovereign.

Option H mentions collateral estoppel. I think collateral estoppel is when an issue has been decided in a previous trial, so it can't be retried. But here, the issue is whether the same act can be tried in another state. Collateral estoppel doesn't apply across sovereigns, I believe. So H might not be the right answer.

Option I says yes because jeopardy prohibits a second prosecution after a conviction. But again, this is about the same sovereign. Different states don't fall under this.

Option J says no because jeopardy only prohibits after acquittal. But here, there was a conviction, so J isn't about this scenario.

So, putting it together. The key point is that each state is a separate sovereign. Therefore, State B can prosecute him even after State A's conviction. So the answer should be D: No, because the man's conduct violated the laws of two different states, and each has the right to enforce its laws.

Wait, but I remember something about dual sovereignty doctrine. Yes, the U.S. Supreme Court case of Bartkus v. Illinois established that a state and the federal government are separate sovereigns, so each can prosecute for the same act without violating double jeopardy. But in this case, it's two states, not federal and state. So the same principle applies. Therefore, double jeopardy doesn't bar the second prosecution.

The correct answer is D: No, because the man's conduct violated the laws of two different states, and each has the right to enforce its laws.
