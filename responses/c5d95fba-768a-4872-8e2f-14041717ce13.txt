Question:

Calculate the Gross Domestic Product using the total expenditure approach:
Consumption Expenditures | $500 billion
Wages and salaries | $400 billion
(Gross Private) Investments Expenditures | $80 billion
Government Expenditures | $100 billion

B: 730
C: 710
D: 760
E: 640
F: 680
G: 650
H: 720
I: 750
J: 660

Okay, so I've got this economics problem here about calculating the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) using the total expenditure approach. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

First, I remember that the total expenditure approach, also known as the expenditure method, sums up all the spending in the economy. The formula is usually GDP = Consumption + Investments + Government Spending + Net Exports. Wait, Net Exports is Exports minus Imports, right? So I have to make sure to account for that.

Let me list out the given data:

- Consumption Expenditures: $500 billion
- Wages and salaries: $400 billion (Hmm, I think wages and salaries are part of income, not expenditure. So maybe this isn't directly used in the expenditure method.)
- Gross Private Investments Expenditures: $80 billion
- Government Expenditures: $100 billion
- Taxes: $70 billion (Taxes are part of government revenue, but in the expenditure approach, I don't think we subtract them directly. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up different methods.)
- Imports: $50 billion
- Exports: $30 billion

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me clarify the components. The expenditure method is C + I + G + (X - M), where C is consumption, I is investment, G is government spending, X is exports, and M is imports.

So from the data:

C = 500 billion
I = 80 billion
G = 100 billion
X = 30 billion
M = 50 billion

So Net Exports (X - M) would be 30 - 50 = -20 billion. That means exports are less than imports, which would subtract from the GDP.

Now, adding up the components:

GDP = C + I + G + (X - M)
GDP = 500 + 80 + 100 + (30 - 50)
Let me compute that:

500 + 80 = 580
580 + 100 = 680
30 - 50 = -20
680 + (-20) = 660

Wait, but looking at the options, J is 660. So is that the answer? But wait, I'm not sure if I'm missing something because I remember that sometimes taxes are involved, but in the expenditure approach, taxes are part of government revenue, and they're not subtracted directly. Or wait, perhaps the government's total expenditure already includes taxes? No, I think in the expenditure approach, the government's spending is separate from taxes. So taxes are part of the government's revenue, but in the GDP calculation, it's about spending, not revenue.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check again. The problem lists "Taxes" as $70 billion. Does that affect the GDP calculation in the expenditure approach? I think in the expenditure approach, taxes are not directly subtracted. Instead, taxes are part of the income approach, where we calculate GDP by adding up all income earned by factors of production and then subtracting taxes. But in the expenditure approach, we focus on spending, not income.

So perhaps the $70 billion in taxes is irrelevant for this calculation because we're using the expenditure method, which doesn't factor in taxes the same way. So I shouldn't include it in the GDP calculation here.

Wait, but maybe I should think differently. Let me make sure. The expenditure method formula is C + I + G + (X - M). So the government's spending is G, which is $100 billion. The taxes are part of government's revenue, but unless there's a relation to government spending, I don't think it affects the GDP in the expenditure approach. So I should proceed with the numbers as given.

So adding up:

500 (C) + 80 (I) = 580
580 + 100 (G) = 680
Then, Net Exports: 30 -50 = -20
680 + (-20) = 660.

So the GDP would be $660 billion, which is option J.

Wait, but looking at the options, E is 640, F is 680, J is 660. So my calculation leads me to J. But wait, I'm a bit unsure because sometimes there's confusion between the expenditure approach and the income approach. Let me double-check.

In the expenditure approach, the formula is indeed C + I + G + Net Exports. So I think I did it right.

Alternatively, sometimes people might get confused and subtract taxes, but that's not part of the expenditure approach. For example, maybe someone would think GDP = C + I + G + Net Exports - Taxes, but that's not correct. Taxes are part of the income approach, not the expenditure method.

So yes, I think the correct answer is 660 billion, which is option J.

The GDP is calculated using the total expenditure approach as follows:

GDP = Consumption + Investments + Government Spending + (Exports - Imports)

Plugging in the given values:

GDP = 500 + 80 + 100 + (30 - 50)  
GDP = 500 + 80 + 100 - 20  
GDP = 660 billion

The correct answer is J.
