Okay, so I have this question here: If today is Wednesday, what day of the week will it be 10^(10^10) days from now? The options are from A to J, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.

First, I know that the days of the week repeat every 7 days. So, to find the day after a certain number of days, I can use modulo 7 arithmetic. That is, I can divide the number of days by 7 and find the remainder. The remainder will tell me how many days ahead from Wednesday I should count.

So, the main task is to compute 10^(10^10) modulo 7. Wait, 10^(10^10) is a huge number. But I remember that for large exponents, modular arithmetic can simplify things using properties like Euler's theorem or Fermat's little theorem. Let me recall: Fermat's little theorem says that if p is a prime number, then for any integer a not divisible by p, a^(p-1) ≡ 1 mod p. Since 7 is prime, and 10 is not divisible by 7, maybe I can use this.

So, 10^6 ≡ 1 mod 7 because 10^6 mod 7 is 1. That means 10^k ≡ 10^(k mod 6) mod 7. So, to compute 10^(10^10) mod 7, I can first find the exponent 10^10 mod 6, then use that to find the result.

Wait, why mod 6? Because the exponent's exponent is 10^10, and since 10 and 7 are coprime, the cycle repeats every 6 exponents (from Fermat's theorem). Therefore, 10^(10^10) mod 7 = 10^( (10^10 mod 6) ) mod 7.

So, first, compute 10^10 mod 6. Let's see: 10 mod 6 is 4, so 10 ≡ 4 mod 6. Then, 10^10 mod 6 is the same as 4^10 mod 6. Let's compute 4^10 mod 6.

But wait, 4 mod 6 is 4. 4^1 mod6=4, 4^2=16 mod6=4, because 16/6 is 2*6=12, 16-12=4. So 4^2 mod6=4. Hmm, it seems that any power of 4 mod6 is 4. Because 4*4=16≡4 mod6, and so on. So 4^10 mod6=4.

Therefore, 10^10 mod6=4. So now, the exponent in 10^(10^10) is 4. So, 10^(10^10) mod7 = 10^4 mod7.

Now, compute 10^4 mod7. Let's compute 10 mod7=3. So 10^4 mod7 is the same as 3^4 mod7.

3^1=3 mod7
3^2=9 mod7=2
3^3=3*2=6 mod7
3^4=3*6=18 mod7=4 (since 14 is 2*7, 18-14=4).

So, 10^4 mod7=4. Therefore, 10^(10^10) mod7=4.

So, starting from Wednesday, adding 4 days: Wednesday (0), Thursday (1), Friday (2), Saturday (3), Sunday (4). Wait, no, wait: adding 4 days to Wednesday. Let me count: Wednesday +1=Thursday, +2=Friday, +3=Saturday, +4=Sunday. So, 4 days ahead is Sunday.

Wait, but the options include Sunday (A) and Wednesday (B). So, the answer should be Sunday, which is option A.

Wait, but let me double-check my steps because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in modular arithmetic.

First step: 10^10 mod6. Since 10≡4 mod6, 10^10≡4^10 mod6. As I thought earlier, 4^2=16≡4 mod6. So 4^even power is 4 mod6, and 4^odd is 4 mod6. So 4^10 mod6=4. So exponent is 4.

Then, 10^4 mod7. 10 mod7=3, so 3^4=81. 81 divided by7: 7*11=77, 81-77=4. So yes, 81 mod7=4.

So, 10^(10^10) mod7=4. So 4 days from Wednesday is Sunday. So answer is A.

Wait, but wait another thing: sometimes when dealing with exponents, the modulus can have cycles, but I think I handled it correctly with Fermat's theorem.

Another way to think: 10 mod7=3. So 10^k mod7=3^k mod7.

We can compute 3^k mod7. Since 3^6≡1 mod7 by Fermat's theorem, so 3^(6m + r) ≡ (3^6)^m *3^r ≡1^m *3^r ≡3^r mod7.

So, the exponent in 3^k is k=10^10. So, to find k mod6, because 3^6≡1 mod7.

So, k=10^10. We need 10^10 mod6.

As before, 10≡4 mod6, so 10^10≡4^10 mod6. Since 4 mod6=4, 4^2=16≡4 mod6. So 4^any power is 4 mod6. Therefore, 10^10 mod6=4.

Thus, 3^(10^10) mod7=3^4 mod7=81 mod7=4.

So, same result. So yes, the day is 4 days ahead, which is Sunday. So answer is A.

Wait, but let me check the options again:

A: Sunday
B: Wednesday
C: Tuesday
D: Saturday
E: The day cannot be determined
F: No day because the world ends
G: Every day, cycle repeats
H: Thursday
I: Monday
J: Friday

So, Sunday is option A. So the answer should be A.
</think>

The problem involves determining the day of the week 10^(10^10) days from Wednesday. Using modular arithmetic, we find that 10^(10^10) modulo 7 is 4. Adding 4 days to Wednesday results in Sunday.
