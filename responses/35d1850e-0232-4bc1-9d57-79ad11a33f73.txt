Question:

A 45-year-old man comes to the physician because of right shoulder pain that began after he chopped wood 2 days ago. Examination of the right upper extremity shows no obvious bone deformities or point tenderness. The pain is reproduced when the patient is asked to externally rotate the shoulder against resistance; there is no weakness. In addition to the teres minor, inflammation of which of the following tendons is most likely in this patient?

Options:

A: Deltoid
B: Infraspinatus
C: Supraspinatus
D: Triceps Brachii
E: Subscapularis
F: Coracobrachialis
G: Teres Major
H: Pectoralis
I: Brachialis
J: Biceps Brachii

Answer:

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about a patient with shoulder pain. Let me try to work through it step by step.

The patient is a 45-year-old man who came in with right shoulder pain after chopping wood two days ago. When the doctor examined him, there were no obvious bone deformities or point tenderness. The pain is reproduced when he's asked to externally rotate the shoulder against resistance, and there's no weakness noted. The question is about identifying which tendon is inflamed besides the teres minor.

Hmm, I remember that the shoulder has several tendons that can get inflamed, leading to conditions like tendinitis. The common ones I think about are the rotator cuff tendons. The rotator cuff consists of four muscles: supraspinatus, infraspinatus, teres minor, and subscapularis. Each of these muscles has a tendon that can become inflamed.

The patient's pain is triggered by external rotation against resistance. External rotation of the shoulder is primarily the function of the infraspinatus and teres minor muscles. The supraspinatus is more involved in abduction, and the subscapularis assists in internal rotation.

Since the teres minor is already mentioned as inflamed, the other likely candidate here would be the infraspinatus. Both of these muscles are key in external rotation, so if that's causing pain, it's probably one of them.

Looking at the options, option B is infraspinatus, and option C is supraspinatus. Since supraspinatus is more about abduction, and in this case, the movement causing pain is external rotation, I think B is the better choice.

Wait, but I should double-check. The teres minor is part of the rotator cuff and is responsible for external rotation as well. So if both are inflamed, but the question says in addition to teres minor, which one else? Maybe the question is pointing towards another possible inflamed tendon besides teres minor.

Alternatively, could it be the supraspinatus? If the patient had pain on abduction, but here it's external rotation. So probably not. So yeah, infraspinatus seems more likely.

Another thought: the supraspinatus is often implicated in shoulder pain, especially with overhead activities, but in this case, the movement causing pain is external rotation. So I think the answer is B, infraspinatus.

The patient's pain is triggered by external rotation against resistance, which is primarily associated with the infraspinatus and teres minor muscles. Since the teres minor is already mentioned as inflamed, the next likely tendon involved is the infraspinatus. 

Answer: B
