Question:

One problem concerning space flight is the removal of carbon dioxide (CO_2, molecular weight = 44.0 g / mole) emitted by the human body (about 924 g of CO_2 per day). One solution is to react CO_2 with sodium hydroxide (NaOH, molecular weight = 40.0 g / mole) to form water and sodium carbonate (Na_2CO_3, molecular weight = 94 g / mole) according to the followingreation: 2NaOH + CO_2 \ding{217} NaCO_3- + H_2O. How muchNaOHmust be carried on board a space capsule to remove the CO_2 produced by an astronaut on a 10 day flight?

Options:

A: 20.5 kg
B: 15.7 kg
C: 22.0 kg
D: 18.9 kg
E: 21.2 kg
F: 14.5 kg
G: 19.6 kg
H: 16.8 kg
I: 23.4 kg
J: 17.3 kg

Okay, so I've got this problem about space flight and removing carbon dioxide using sodium hydroxide. Let me try to figure this out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on stoichiometry, but I'll take it slow.

First, the problem says that an astronaut emits about 924 grams of CO2 per day. The mission is 10 days long, so I need to calculate the total CO2 produced. That should be 924 g/day * 10 days. Let me do that: 924 * 10 equals 9240 grams of CO2. So, 9.24 kg of CO2 over 10 days.

Next, the reaction given is: 2 NaOH + CO2 â†’ Na2CO3 + H2O. I need to make sure I get the stoichiometry right. So for every 2 moles of NaOH, I react with 1 mole of CO2. That means the mole ratio of NaOH to CO2 is 2:1.

Now, I should calculate the moles of CO2 produced. The molecular weight of CO2 is 44.0 g/mol. So, moles of CO2 = 9240 g / 44.0 g/mol. Let me compute that. 9240 divided by 44. Hmm, 44*200 is 8800, so 9240-8800=440. 440/44=10, so 200+10=210 moles. So 210 moles of CO2.

Since the reaction requires 2 moles of NaOH per 1 mole of CO2, I'll need twice as much NaOH. So moles of NaOH needed = 2 * 210 = 420 moles.

Now, find the mass of NaOH needed. The molecular weight of NaOH is 40.0 g/mol. So mass = 420 moles * 40 g/mol. Let me calculate that: 420 *40 is 16,800 grams. To convert that to kilograms, divide by 1000: 16.8 kg.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations. CO2: 9240 g divided by 44 is indeed 210 moles. Then 210 *2 =420 moles NaOH. 420 *40=16,800 grams, which is 16.8 kg. Looking at the options, option H is 16.8 kg. So I think that's the answer.

But wait, another thought: Did I account for all the steps correctly? Let me go through again.

Total CO2: 924 g/day *10=9240g. Moles CO2: 9240/44=210. Moles NaOH needed: 210 *2=420. Mass NaOH: 420 *40=16800g=16.8kg. Yep, that seems right. So the answer should be H:16.8 kg.

To determine how much NaOH is needed to remove the CO2 produced by an astronaut over a 10-day mission, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate Total CO2 Produced**:  
   The astronaut emits 924 g of CO2 per day. Over 10 days, the total CO2 produced is:  
   \[
   924 \, \text{g/day} \times 10 \, \text{days} = 9240 \, \text{g}
   \]

2. **Convert CO2 to Moles**:  
   The molecular weight of CO2 is 44.0 g/mol. The number of moles of CO2 is:  
   \[
   \frac{9240 \, \text{g}}{44.0 \, \text{g/mol}} = 210 \, \text{mol}
   \]

3. **Determine Moles of NaOH Needed**:  
   From the balanced chemical equation \(2 \, \text{NaOH} + \text{CO2} \rightarrow \text{Na2CO3} + \text{H2O}\), 2 moles of NaOH react with 1 mole of CO2. Therefore, the moles of NaOH required are:  
   \[
   210 \, \text{mol CO2} \times 2 = 420 \, \text{mol NaOH}
   \]

4. **Calculate Mass of NaOH**:  
   The molecular weight of NaOH is 40.0 g/mol. The mass of NaOH needed is:  
   \[
   420 \, \text{mol} \times 40.0 \, \text{g/mol} = 16,800 \, \text{g} = 16.8 \, \text{kg}
   \]

Thus, the amount of NaOH required is **16.8 kg**, which corresponds to option **H**.
