Okay, so I have this question about calculating the NPV of an investment project. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on finance, but I'll try to remember what I learned.

Alright, the project costs $500 today. So that's the initial outlay. Then, it generates $500 profits in year five and another $500 in year ten. The discount rate is 10%. I need to find the Net Present Value (NPV) of this project.

NPV is calculated by taking the present value of all future cash flows and subtracting the initial investment. So the formula is NPV = PV of future cash flows - Initial Investment.

First, I need to calculate the present value of each $500 received in year five and year ten. The discount rate is 10%, which I can write as 0.10.

For the cash flow in year five, the present value (PV) is calculated as CF / (1 + r)^n. So for year five, n=5 and r=10%. Let me compute that.

PV5 = 500 / (1.10)^5. Hmm, what's 1.10 to the power of 5? Let me think. 1.1^1 is 1.1, 1.1^2 is 1.21, 1.1^3 is about 1.331, 1.1^4 is around 1.4641, and 1.1^5 is approximately 1.6105. So PV5 is 500 / 1.6105 ≈ 310.48.

Next, the cash flow in year ten. PV10 = 500 / (1.10)^10. What's 1.1^10? I remember it's about 2.5937. So PV10 = 500 / 2.5937 ≈ 192.78.

Now, add these two present values together. 310.48 + 192.78 = 503.26. Wait, that's interesting because the total of the present values is about $503.26.

The initial investment is $500. So NPV = 503.26 - 500 = +3.26. Hmm, that's a positive NPV, which would mean the project is profitable. But looking at the options, I don't see a +3.26. The options are A to J, and I see option E is $27, F is $100, but wait, option J is $3, which is close to my 3.26. But wait, maybe I made a calculation error.

Wait, let me double-check the present value calculations. Maybe I approximated too much.

Calculating (1.1)^5 more accurately. Let me compute step by step:

Year 1: 1.1
Year 2: 1.21
Year 3: 1.331
Year 4: 1.4641
Year 5: 1.61051 (I think that's more precise).

So PV5 = 500 / 1.61051 ≈ 310.48.

For (1.1)^10, let me compute it accurately:

Year 1: 1.1
Year 2: 1.21
Year 3: 1.331
Year 4: 1.4641
Year 5: 1.61051
Year 6: 1.61051 * 1.1 = 1.771561
Year 7: 1.771561 *1.1 = 1.9487171
Year 8: 1.9487171 *1.1≈2.14358881
Year 9: 2.14358881 *1.1≈2.35794769
Year 10: 2.35794769 *1.1≈2.59374246

So PV10 = 500 / 2.59374246 ≈ 192.777.

Adding PV5 and PV10: 310.48 + 192.777 ≈ 503.257.

So total PV is approximately $503.26. Subtract initial investment of $500: NPV ≈ $3.26.

Looking at the options, J is $3, which is close. But wait, none of the options are exactly $3.26. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A: -$100

B: $500

C: -$500

D: −$3

E: $27

F: $100

G: -$30

H: $0

I: −$27

J: $3

So J is $3, which is the closest. But wait, perhaps I did something wrong. Maybe I should have used exact values without rounding, but even then, the NPV is positive around $3.26, which is about $3. So the NPV would be positive, which would mean the project is acceptable.

Wait, but wait another thing. The initial cost is $500, and the present value of the cash flows is about $503.26. So the NPV is about $3.26, which is positive. So the project adds value. But looking at the options, the only positive options are B ($500), E ($27), F ($100), H ($0), and J ($3). So J is the closest.

Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the calculation. Let me think again. Wait, the initial investment is $500, and the PV of the two cash flows is about $503.26, so NPV is +3.26. So the project's NPV is about +3, which is option J: $3.

But wait, looking back at the problem statement: the project costs $500 today, which is the initial outflow. Then, the profits are $500 in year five and ten. So the cash flows are:

Year 0: -500

Year 5: +500

Year 10: +500

So the NPV is the sum of PVs of these cash flows.

So as I calculated, PV of year 5 is ~310.48, year 10 ~192.78. Total PV of inflows: 503.26.

Subtract initial outflow: 503.26 -500= +3.26. So NPV is approximately $3.26, which is about $3. So the answer would be J: $3.

Wait, but looking at the options, J is $3. So that's the correct answer.

The Net Present Value (NPV) is calculated by finding the present value of future cash flows and subtracting the initial investment. The project costs $500 today and generates $500 in year five and $500 in year ten, with a discount rate of 10%. 

The present value of the $500 in year five is approximately $310.48, and the present value of the $500 in year ten is approximately $192.78. Adding these gives a total present value of future cash flows of $503.26. Subtracting the initial investment of $500 results in an NPV of approximately $3.26, which rounds to $3. 

Therefore, the correct answer is J: $3.
