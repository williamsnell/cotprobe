Okay, so I've got this question about electromotive force, or emf, in a chemical system. The question is asking what the emf is when the equilibrium constant K equals the concentration quotient Q. The options are A through J, and I need to pick the correct one.

Hmm, I remember from my chemistry class that the emf of a cell is related to the reaction quotient. The formula I think is something like emf = (RT/nF) * ln(Q), but wait, when the system is at equilibrium, Q equals K. Oh right, because at equilibrium, the reaction quotient equals the equilibrium constant.

Wait, but when Q equals K, the system is at equilibrium. What happens to the emf then? I think the cell stops doing work because it's at equilibrium, so the emf should be zero. Because if the system is at equilibrium, there's no net change, so the driving force, which is the emf, must be zero.

Let me think again. The Nernst equation relates the emf to the reaction quotient. The equation is E = E° - (RT/nF) ln Q. When Q is equal to K, which is the case at equilibrium, the reaction isn't spontaneous in either direction, so the emf should be zero. Because at equilibrium, E would be zero.

Wait, no, wait. The standard emf E° is when the concentrations are all at standard conditions (like 1 M for solutions, 1 atm for gases). But when Q equals K, the reaction isn't shifting, so the actual emf E should be zero. So the correct answer would be I: 0.

Let me look at the options again. Option I is 0. Yeah, that makes sense because when Q=K, the system is at equilibrium and there’s no net emf driving the reaction.

The electromotive force (emf) of a system when the equilibrium constant \( K \) equals the concentration quotient \( Q \) is zero. This is because, at equilibrium, the system is at a state where there is no net driving force, meaning the emf is zero.
