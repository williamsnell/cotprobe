Question:

A furniture store had a truck that an employee of the store used to deliver furniture to the store's customers. One afternoon while the employee was driving the truck to deliver a chair to a customer, the employee negligently ran through a stop sign and hit a car. The driver of the car suffered a leg injury and succeeded in suing the furniture store, recovering $25,000. Assume that all of these events occur in a jurisdiction that has statutes permitting defendants to bring claims for contribution and indemnity. In the event that the furniture store brings suit against its employee (the truck driver) to recover for its losses, the furniture store will recover

Options:

A: $15,000, because the employee and the furniture store share 60-40 responsibility for the accident.
B: $25,000, unless the furniture store was fully insured against such losses.
C: nothing, because the furniture store should have maintained the truck in a safer condition.
D: $25,000, because the employee was at fault in causing the accident.
E: nothing, because the furniture store was primarily liable for the entire amount of damages.
F: $12,500, unless the furniture store had provided proper training to the employee.
G: nothing, because the employee was not acting negligently.
H: the full amount, only if the employee has sufficient personal insurance coverage.
I: $12,500, because the employer and employee bear equal shares of responsibility for the plaintiff's injuries.
J: nothing, because the employee was acting within the scope of his employment.

Okay, so I have this question about tort law, specifically dealing with employer and employee liability. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The scenario is that a furniture store has a truck used by an employee for deliveries. The employee was driving the truck and negligently ran through a stop sign, hitting another car. The driver of the car got a leg injury and successfully sued the furniture store for $25,000. Now, the question is about whether the furniture store can sue its employee to recover that $25,000, and if so, how much would they get?

First, I remember that in tort law, when an employee causes harm while acting within the scope of their employment, the employer can be held liable under the doctrine of respondeat superior. This means the employer is responsible for the employee's negligent actions if they were done within the scope of employment. So the store was sued and had to pay $25,000 because the employee was delivering furniture, which is part of his job.

Now, the store is suing the employee for contribution or indemnity. Contribution is when the defendant (the store) seeks to recover part or all of what they paid from another party (the employee), usually based on comparative fault. Indemnity is when one party is legally obligated to compensate another for liability.

The key here is whether the employee was negligent and whether the employer can seek recovery. Since the employee was negligent by running the stop sign, he was at fault. But under respondeat superior, the employer is primarily liable, not the employee. However, the employer can seek indemnity from the employee if the employee was at fault.

So, looking at the options, the question is whether the store can recover the full amount from the employee. Some options suggest partial recovery based on fault, others say nothing because the employee was within the scope, or other reasons.

Option D says the store recovers $25,000 because the employee was at fault. That makes sense because if the employee was negligent, the employer can seek indemnity. But wait, some states allow for indemnity only if the employer can show that the employee's actions were particularly egregious or outside the scope, or that the employer wasn't negligent themselves.

Another angle: sometimes, if the employer is found to be even slightly at fault, they can't recover the full amount. But in this case, the employee was negligent, and the employer was found liable because of the employee's actions. So, the employer can seek indemnity from the employee for the full amount, provided the employee was at fault and the employer wasn't contributorily negligent.

Let me check the options again. Option E says nothing because the store is primarily liable. But that's not necessarily true because indemnity allows the employer to recover from the employee if the employee was at fault. So E might not be correct.

Option J says nothing because the employee was acting within the scope. But that's about the employer's liability, not the employee's liability for indemnity. So J is about why the employer is liable, not whether the employee can be sued.

Option D seems to align with the idea that the employee was at fault, so the employer can recover the full amount. But wait, what about comparative negligence? If the store is in a state that allows contribution, they might have to share liability if both the employee and employer were negligent. But in this case, the employee's negligence caused the accident, and the employer's liability is vicarious. So the employer can seek indemnity because the employee was the one at fault.

Therefore, the correct answer would be D: $25,000 because the employee was at fault.

The furniture store can recover the full $25,000 from the employee because the employee was negligent and the doctrine of indemnity allows the employer to seek full recovery from the employee who was at fault. 

Answer: D
