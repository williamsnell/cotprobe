Alright, I'm trying to figure out during which time frame anatomically modern Homo sapiens existed. I remember that Homo sapiens are the species that we, humans, belong to. Anatomically modern means that they have the same physical characteristics as modern humans, right? So I think this refers to when humans started looking like us today.

I recall that the earliest Homo sapiens fossils are from around 200,000 years ago. There's a site in Ethiopia called Omo Kibish where some of the oldest modern human remains were found. So that's probably the starting point. As for the end of the time frame, well, we're still here today, so that's the present.

Looking at the options, I need to find the one that starts around 200,000 years ago and goes up to now. Let's go through the options one by one.

Option A: 600,000 to 300,000 years ago. That seems too early because modern humans didn't appear until about 200,000 years ago, so this period would have been before modern Homo sapiens existed.

Option B: 100,000 years ago to present. That's possible, but I think modern humans appeared earlier than 100,000 years ago, so this might be too recent as a starting point.

Option C: 400,000 to present. Again, that's earlier than 200,000, so maybe not the best fit.

Option D: 800,000 to 10,000 years ago. Hmm, 800,000 is way too early for modern humans. Also, 10,000 years ago is the end of the last ice age, but modern humans have been around longer than that.

Option E: 500,000 to 200,000 years ago. Wait, but 500,000 is earlier than 200,000, which doesn't make sense because the start date should be after the appearance of modern humans.

Option F: 300,000 to 100,000 years ago. So this is 300k to 100k. That's a bit too recent for the start, as modern humans appeared around 200k, so this would miss the earliest part.

Option G: 200,000 to 10,000 years ago. That seems promising because 200k is when modern humans appeared, and 10k is just the end of the ice age, but humans were around beyond that too.

Option H: 1,000,000 to 500,000 years ago. That's way too early; definitely before modern Homo sapiens.

Option I: 800,000 years ago to present. Again, 800k is too early, but the present is correct. So this option includes too much time before modern humans.

Option J: 200,000 to present. Oh, this seems spot on. It starts exactly when modern humans appeared and goes up to now. That matches what I was thinking.

Wait, but option G is 200k to 10k, and J is 200k to present. So which is correct? I think the modern Homo sapiens have been around from 200k years ago to now, so J is the correct answer because it includes the entire duration up to the present day. Option G stops at 10k, which is just the end of the ice age, but humans have been around for longer than that.

The correct answer is J: 200,000 to present. Modern Homo sapiens are believed to have appeared around 200,000 years ago, and they have continued to exist up to the present day. This aligns with the time frame provided in option J.

Answer: J
