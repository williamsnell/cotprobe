Question:

A 45-year-old woman has a 2-week history of increased anxiety, abdominal discomfort, irritability, and difficulty concentrating; she was robbed at knifepoint in a parking lot 3 weeks ago. She takes levothyroxine for hypothyroidism and uses an over-the-counter inhaler as needed for exercise-induced asthma. Her blood pressure is 140/80 mm Hg, and pulse is 100/min. Examination shows dry skin and hair. She is cooperative but appears anxious, glancing around quickly when a loud noise is heard outside the office. Leukocyte count is 12,000/mm3 , and serum thyroid-stimulating hormone concentration is 5.0 μU/mL. An ECG shows sinus tachycardia. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

Options:

A: Generalized anxiety disorder
B: Social anxiety disorder
C: Obsessive-compulsive disorder
D: Adjustment disorder
E: Post-traumatic stress disorder
F: Hypothyroidism
G: Panic disorder
H: Agoraphobia
I: Specific phobia
J: Acute stress disorder

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this multiple-choice question about a patient's diagnosis. Let me go through the details step by step.

The patient is a 45-year-old woman with a 2-week history of increased anxiety, abdominal discomfort, irritability, and trouble concentrating. She was robbed at knifepoint in a parking lot three weeks ago. That sounds like a pretty traumatic event. She's on levothyroxine for hypothyroidism and uses an over-the-counter inhaler for exercise-induced asthma. Her vitals are BP 140/80 and pulse 100/min. On exam, she has dry skin and hair. She appears anxious, glancing quickly when there's a loud noise outside. Her lab results show a leukocyte count of 12,000/mm³ and TSH of 5.0 μU/mL. The ECG shows sinus tachycardia.

First, I'll think about her possible conditions. The key here is her recent robbery, which was a traumatic event. The symptoms she's presenting now started around two weeks after that incident. Her anxiety, difficulty concentrating, irritability—these are classic signs of an anxiety disorder.

Looking at the options:

A: Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) - Usually has chronic, excessive worry without a specific trigger. Her symptoms are more acute and tied to a recent event.

B: Social anxiety disorder - Focused on social situations; doesn't seem to fit here.

C: Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) - Involves obsessions and compulsions, which aren't mentioned.

D: Adjustment disorder - This involves a maladaptive reaction to a life stressor, but it's usually shorter-term and less severe than PTSD.

E: Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) - This is a strong contender. She experienced a traumatic event, and her symptoms fit: re-experiencing (maybe through anxiety), hypervigilance (glancing at noise), and hyperarousal (tachycardia, high BP).

F: Hypothyroidism - Her TSH is slightly elevated at 5.0, but hypothyroidism typically presents with fatigue, weight gain, cold intolerance, etc. Her symptoms don't align as much with classic hypothyroidism.

G: Panic disorder - Characterized by panic attacks, which aren't described here. She doesn't report recurrent panic attacks.

H: Agoraphobia - Fear of places, especially those where escape might be difficult. Not directly linked to the robbery.

I: Specific phobia - Fear of a specific object or situation, which isn't indicated.

J: Acute stress disorder - Similar to PTSD but occurs within a month of trauma. Symptoms can include anxiety, hypervigilance, etc. But PTSD is more persistent.

Now, considering the timeline: symptoms started two weeks after the event. PTSD can develop within weeks, sometimes months. The robbery was a severe trauma, so the diagnosis is likely PTSD. Her ECG shows sinus tachycardia, which is common in anxiety and stress. The leukocytosis might be from stress response.

I should also consider other options. Adjustment disorder (D) is possible, but it doesn't usually present with the same intensity or specific symptoms like re-experiencing the trauma. Her physical signs like high BP and tachycardia, along with the anxiety, point more towards a stress-related disorder like PTSD.

So, putting it all together, the most likely diagnosis is E: Post-traumatic stress disorder.

The patient's symptoms, including anxiety, irritability, hypervigilance, and physiological signs like sinus tachycardia, align with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) following a traumatic robbery. 

Answer: E
