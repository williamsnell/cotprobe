Okay, so I've got this question about the federal budget deficit and debt, and I need to figure out which statement is correct. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, so I need to think carefully.

First, I remember that the budget deficit is the amount the government spends beyond what it earns in taxes. So when the government spends more than it takes in, that's a deficit. Conversely, if it spends less, that's a surplus.

Now, the federal debt is the total amount the government owes, right? It's like the accumulated deficits over time. So each year, if there's a deficit, that adds to the debt. If there's a surplus, that reduces the debt. Got it so far.

Let me look at the options one by one.

Option A says the debt is the sum of all past and future deficits. Hmm. The debt is the sum of past deficits minus any surpluses. But future deficits aren't guaranteed; they're projections. So I'm not sure if A is correct because it includes future deficits, which might not happen. Maybe A is incorrect.

Option B: When the debt is positive, the deficit decreases. Wait, a positive debt just means the government owes money. The deficit is the current year's spending over revenues. So if the debt is positive, it doesn't necessarily mean the deficit is decreasing. The deficit could be increasing or decreasing regardless of the current debt status. So B might not be correct.

Option C: When the deficit is negative, the debt decreases. A negative deficit is a surplus. So if the government has a surplus, it's paying back debt, so the debt would decrease. That makes sense. So C sounds correct.

Option D: The deficit is the accumulation of past debts. No, that's backwards. The debt is the accumulation of past deficits. The deficit is the current year's imbalance. So D is incorrect.

Option E: When the debt is negative, the deficit decreases. Wait, can the debt be negative? I think a negative debt would mean the government has more money than it needs, but that's not common. Usually, debt is positive. Maybe E is not applicable or incorrect.

Option F: The deficit is the accumulation of future debts. No, the deficit is the current year's situation, not future debts. So F is wrong.

Option G: The deficit and debt are always equal. No, because the debt is the sum over time, not the current deficit. They can be different. So G is incorrect.

Option H: When the deficit is positive, the debt decreases. No, a positive deficit means the government is spending more, so the debt increases. So H is wrong.

Option I: When the debt is positive, the deficit increases. Not necessarily. The deficit could be positive or negative regardless of the debt's status. So I don't think I is correct.

Option J: When the debt is negative, the deficit increases. Again, debt being negative is rare, and the deficit's relation isn't directly tied to the debt's sign. So J is likely incorrect.

So going back, the correct statement seems to be Option C: When the deficit is negative, the debt decreases. Because a negative deficit is a surplus, which reduces the overall debt.

The correct answer is C: When the deficit is negative, the debt decreases. A negative deficit indicates a surplus, which reduces the federal debt.

Answer: C
