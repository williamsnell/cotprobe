Okay, so I have this multiple choice question about the doctrine of substantial performance. Hmm, I remember that substantial performance is a concept in contract law where a party has fulfilled most of their obligations under a contract, except for minor details. If that's the case, the party is considered to have performed, and any damages would be limited to the minor deficiency.

The question is asking which transaction correctly illustrates this doctrine. The options are A through H. Let me go through each one.

Option A: The contract required hair styling to Toby's satisfaction, but Toby was dissatisfied. Wait, but was the dissatisfaction based on a minor issue? If the hairdresser did everything correctly but Toby just didn't like it, that might be a case of substantial performance because the main work was done. But I'm not sure if dissatisfaction alone counts as a minor issue.

Option B: Leslie painted the room but didn't put back the electrical outlet covers. That seems like a failure to complete a part of the work. If the painting was done but something minor was missed, that might be substantial performance. But I'm not certain if leaving the outlet covers off is considered a minor issue or a significant omission.

Option C: Blair ordered blue chairs, got red instead. That's a different color. I think color might be a material term, so this might not be substantial performance because the chairs are a different product. The buyer probably wouldn't accept this as substantial.

Option D: A carpenter used pine instead of oak. Wood type could be a material term, so this might not qualify as substantial performance. If the contract specified oak, using pine might be a breach because the material is different.

Option E: Dentist pulled the wrong tooth competently. That's a mistake, but pulling the wrong tooth is a significant issue. The dentist didn't fulfill the contract as intended, so this might not be substantial performance.

Option F: Builder forgot to install the kitchen sink. That's a major part of building a house. Without the sink, the house isn't complete. This seems like a significant failure, so probably not substantial performance.

Option G: Chef used pepper instead of salt. That's a mistake in seasoning, but maybe it's a minor part of the meal. If the rest of the meal was good, this could be a case where the chef substantially performed but made a minor error. So this might be the correct answer.

Option H: Mechanic fixed the car but forgot to change the oil. Changing oil is a routine maintenance task. If the main repairs were done, forgetting the oil change might be a minor oversight, making it substantial performance.

Wait, so I'm thinking between options G and H. Let me think again. In contract law, substantial performance requires that the breach is only in minor details. So for a chef using pepper instead of salt, that's a minor mistake if the meal was otherwise good. Similarly, a mechanic forgetting the oil change might be minor if the main repair was done.

But which one is more about minor details? Using the wrong seasoning might be more about the taste, which could be significant to the customer. Whereas forgetting an oil change could be seen as a missed step in maintenance, which might be considered more minor in the context of the repair service.

Alternatively, in the painting example in option B, not putting back outlet covers is a minor detail because the main painting was done. But the question didn't specify whether the covers were part of the contract. If the painter was supposed to replace them, not doing so is a breach, but perhaps a minor one.

Hmm, I think the key is to find a case where the main obligations were fulfilled, and the failure was minor. So in option D, using a different wood is probably a material breach because wood type is a key component. Similarly, in E, pulling the wrong tooth is a significant mistake.

In option G, the chef used the wrong seasoning. If the rest of the meal was fine, that might be a minor issue, so G would be substantial performance. But I'm not entirely sure. Another perspective is that in some cases, the substitution of materials (like pepper for salt) could be a minor breach if it doesn't affect the overall outcome much.

Alternatively, in option H, the mechanic's failure to change oil is a minor oversight if the main repair was done. So both G and H could be candidates. But which one is more about the doctrine?

Wait, the doctrine of substantial performance allows for recovery as long as the performance was "substantial," meaning the failure was in trivial matters. So in the chef's case, using pepper instead of salt might be considered trivial if the rest of the meal was good. Similarly, the mechanic forgetting the oil change might be trivial if the main repair was done.

But I'm not sure if using the wrong seasoning is considered trivial. It might affect the meal's taste, which is important, so maybe it's not trivial. On the other hand, forgetting the oil change could be considered a minor detail if the main repairs were completed.

Alternatively, in option B, the painter didn't put back the outlet covers. That seems like a small oversight, maybe considered trivial. But again, I'm not certain.

Wait, another angle: the doctrine is about whether the non-performance is so minor that it doesn't go to the root of the contract. So in option D, using pine instead of oak might affect the value and purpose, so it's a material breach. In option G, the wrong seasoning might affect the meal's quality, but perhaps not the main structure.

In option H, the mechanic's failure to change the oil is a minor part of the service. So if the main issue (say, fixing the engine) was done, forgetting the oil change might be deemed substantial performance.

Alternatively, the answer might be option G because using the wrong seasoning is a minor mistake, making the performance substantial. Or perhaps option B, where the painting was done but covers were missing.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to recall the concept. Substantial performance means the party has fulfilled all the essential parts of the contract, and any failure is minor. So the non-performance is in trivial details, not the main purpose.

So looking again:

Option B: Painting done, but outlet covers missing. If the contract required painting and replacing the covers, then missing the covers is a failure. But is it minor? Maybe, because the main painting was done.

Option G: Wrong seasoning. If the contract was for a meal with salt, using pepper is a breach, but maybe minor if the rest was good.

Option H: Mechanic fixed the car but forgot oil. If the main repair was done, maybe the oil change is minor.

I think the correct answer is B, D, or H. Wait, no, the question is about which illustrates substantial performance. So the correct scenario is where the performance was mostly done, except for minor details.

Wait, wait, I think I remember that in some cases, using a different material (like pine instead of oak) is a material breach because it changes the nature of the product. So D is not substantial performance.

In option G, using pepper instead of salt might be a minor mistake if the rest of the meal was prepared correctly. So that could be substantial performance.

Alternatively, in option B, the painter didn't put back the outlet covers. That might be a minor omission, so the painting was done, which is the main part.

But I'm not sure which one is the best example. Maybe the correct answer is B, because the main work (painting) was done, and the omission is minor.

Wait, another thought: substantial performance allows the non-breaching party to recover the contract price minus the value of the missing minor parts. So in option B, Leslie painted but didn't put back the outlet covers. The value of the covers might be minimal, so the payment would be adjusted accordingly.

Alternatively, in option G, the chef used the wrong seasoning. The cost of salt versus pepper is minimal, so the adjustment would be small.

I think both B and G could be candidates, but I need to choose the best one.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option B because it's a clear omission of a part of the work, whereas in G, it's a substitution that might not affect the overall meal as much. Or maybe it's G because the substitution is a minor breach.

I'm a bit stuck. Let me try to think of real examples. A painter not replacing covers is a small mistake, so the payment would be almost full. Similarly, a chef using wrong seasoning is a minor error, so the payment would be adjusted slightly.

But I think the key is that the main obligation was fulfilled. So in G, the chef cooked the meal, just used the wrong seasoning. That's substantial performance. Similarly, in B, the painter painted but missed the covers.

I think the answer is B because it's a clear example of a failure to complete a part of the work, but the main work was done. So the correct answer is B.

The doctrine of substantial performance applies when a party fulfills most of their contractual obligations, except for minor details. The failure must be trivial and not affect the root purpose of the contract. 

- **Option A**: Toby's dissatisfaction is subjective and not necessarily minor. 
- **Option B**: Leslie painted the room but failed to replace the outlet covers. This omission is minor, as the main work (painting) was completed. 
- **Option C**: Delivering red chairs instead of blue is a material breach because color is a key term. 
- **Option D**: Using pine instead of oak is a material breach because it changes the nature of the product. 
- **Option E**: Pulling the wrong tooth is a significant mistake, not minor. 
- **Option F**: Forgetting to install the kitchen sink is a major omission. 
- **Option G**: Using pepper instead of salt could affect the meal's quality, potentially making it non-trivial. 
- **Option H**: Forgetting to change the oil is minor if the main repairs were done, but the omission could be seen as more significant in maintenance contexts.

Between **B** and **G**, **B** is the better example because the main obligation (painting) was fulfilled, and the omission (not replacing outlet covers) is clearly minor. 

Answer: B
