Question:

What data support the theory that short-term memory is essentially auditory?

Options:

A: The theory is supported by the fact that people can remember music better than words.
B: Experiments that reveal short-term memory performs equally well with auditory, visual, and kinesthetic information.
C: Short-term memory does not involve auditory processes.
D: Findings that suggest short-term memory is linked primarily to tactile sensations and the ability to remember textures.
E: Studies indicating that individuals recall visual patterns with higher accuracy than auditory information.
F: Observations that people with better spatial awareness have superior short-term memory.
G: Short-term memory is visual.
H: Research demonstrating that short-term memory capacity is significantly increased when information is presented visually rather than auditorily.
I: Experiments showing auditory recoding in recall process and the detrimental effects of interruptions in rhythmic sequence on recall.
J: Evidence showing a correlation between short-term memory and olfactory senses.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about short-term memory and whether it's essentially auditory. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking which data supports the theory that short-term memory is essentially auditory. The options are A to J, each presenting a different piece of evidence or experiment.

First, I remember that short-term memory, or working memory, is often discussed in terms of how information is stored and processed. I think there's a famous experiment by George Miller from the 1950s where he found that people can remember about 7Â±2 pieces of information in short-term memory. But I'm not sure if that's directly related to whether it's auditory or not.

Another thing that comes to mind is the concept of 'phonological looping,' where information is repeated in a verbal or auditory manner to keep it in memory. For example, when you repeat a phone number to yourself to remember it longer. That seems to support the idea that short-term memory is tied to auditory processes because it uses sound to maintain the information.

Looking at the options now:

Option A: People remember music better than words. Hmm, music is auditory, but I'm not sure if this directly supports that short-term memory is auditory. It might just mean that auditory information is processed differently, but not necessarily that memory is essentially auditory.

Option B: Experiments show short-term memory performs equally well with different types of info. If it's equally good with auditory, visual, etc., that might not support the theory that it's essentially auditory. It could mean it's more versatile.

Option C: Short-term memory doesn't involve auditory processes. This seems to directly contradict the theory, so probably not the right answer.

Option D: Linked to tactile sensations. That's about touch, so it doesn't support the auditory theory.

Option E: Visual patterns are recalled better. If visual is better, that would argue against the theory, so not the right choice.

Option F: Spatial awareness and short-term memory. Not directly related to auditory, so probably not.

Option G: Short-term memory is visual. This is the opposite of what the question is about, so not the answer.

Option H: Visual presentation increases capacity. Again, this suggests visual is better, which would go against the theory that it's auditory.

Option I: Experiments show auditory recoding and interruptions in rhythmic sequences affect recall. Auditory recoding sounds like using sound to remember, which fits with the idea that short-term memory relies on auditory processes. Also, if interrupting the rhythm (like a verbal loop) affects recall, that supports the theory because the verbal loop is a method used for maintaining information in short-term memory.

Option J: Correlation with olfactory senses. That's about smell, which isn't related to the auditory theory.

So, putting it together, the theory that short-term memory is essentially auditory is supported by evidence that shows auditory recoding happens during recall and that disrupting the rhythm (which relates to verbal repetition) affects recall. That points to option I.

The correct answer is I, as it highlights the role of auditory recoding and the impact of rhythmic interruptions on recall, both of which align with the theory that short-term memory is fundamentally auditory.

Answer: I
