Alright, so I've got this question here about the primary colors of light. Hmm, I remember learning something about this in school, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Let me think through it step by step.

Okay, the question is asking which color isn't considered one of the primary colors of light. The options are A: red, B: green, C: blue, and D: yellow. I've heard the term "primary colors" before, but I'm not entirely sure how it applies to light specifically.

Wait, I think primary colors are the basic colors that can be combined to create other colors. For light, I remember something about RGB—Red, Green, and Blue. Oh right, RGB stands for Red, Green, and Blue, and those are the primary colors in additive color mixing. That's the system used in things like TVs and computer monitors. When these three colors are combined in different intensities, they can create any color we see on the screen.

So if the primary colors are red, green, and blue, then the fourth option here is yellow. That must be the one that's not a primary color. But wait, sometimes I get confused between subtractive and additive color models. In the subtractive model, like with paints, the primary colors are different—like red, blue, and yellow. But this question is specifically about light, so the additive model applies.

Wait, let me double-check. Additive uses RGB, so red, green, blue are primary. Yellow isn't one of them. So the answer should be D: yellow.

The primary colors of light are red, green, and blue (RGB). Yellow is not considered a primary color in this context. 

Answer: D
