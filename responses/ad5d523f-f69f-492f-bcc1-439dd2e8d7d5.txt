Okay, so I've got this problem about calculating the inversion density for a helium-neon laser. I remember inversion density is related to population inversion, which is crucial for laser action. Let's see, the formula I think is n_j - n_i multiplied by (g_j/g_i), where n's are the populations and g's are the statistical weights.

The given wavelength is 6328 Å, which I think is red light. But wait, wavelength might not directly affect the inversion density calculation, unless it's used to find the energy difference between the states. Oh right, the energy difference is E = hc/λ. H is Planck's constant, c speed of light, and λ wavelength.

The gain constant is 2% per meter. Gain constant usually relates to the amplification of light per unit length. But wait, I'm not sure how it directly ties into inversion density. Maybe it's used in the gain formula which involves inversion density. I think the gain coefficient G is related to the inversion density N and other factors like the transition probability.

Temperature is 100°C, which is 373 K. Thermal energy might affect the population distribution. Using the Boltzmann distribution, the ratio of populations between upper and lower states is (g_j/g_i) * exp(-ΔE/(kT)). Wait, but we're looking for inversion, so maybe when the upper state population exceeds the lower, which depends on temperature.

The lifetime of the upper state is 1e-7 seconds. The lifetime τ is related to the transition probability. The transition rate from upper to lower state is 1/τ. But how does that tie into inversion density?

Inversion density n_j - n_i is given by (g_j/g_i) * (N * (1/(exp(ΔE/(kT)) - 1))), but I might be mixing up some terms here. Alternatively, maybe it's better to approach it using the Einstein coefficients.

Wait, Einstein's A coefficient is the spontaneous emission rate. So A_ij = 1/τ, where τ is the lifetime. So A_ij = 1e7 s^-1.

The population inversion n_j - n_i can be found using the relation for a three-level or four-level system. Helium-neon is a four-level laser, I think. For a four-level system, the inversion is given by:

n_j - n_i = (g_j/g_i) * (N * A_ij)/(A_ji + 2u_j c_j), but I'm not sure. Maybe a simpler approach is to use the relation involving the gain constant.

Wait, the gain constant (α) is given as 2% per meter. Gain is proportional to the inversion density. The formula for gain is α = (λ * A_ij * N * (g_j/g_i)) / (something). Or perhaps α = (A_ij * (g_j/g_i)) * N, where N is the inversion density.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled. Let me think again. The gain coefficient α is related to the inversion density. The formula for gain is α = (h c / λ) * (g_j/g_i) * (n_j - n_i). So rearranging, inversion density n_j - n_i = α * λ / (h c (g_j/g_i)).

Wait, but wait, the gain α is given in 2% per meter, so that's 0.02 m^-1.

Let me plug in the numbers. h is Planck's constant, 6.626e-34 J·s. c is 3e8 m/s. λ is 6328 Å = 6328e-10 m.

So h c / λ = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (6328e-10) ≈ let's compute that.

Calculating numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Divide by 6328e-10 m: 1.9878e-25 / 6.328e-7 ≈ 3.14e-19 J.

Wait, but J is kg·m²/s². Not sure if that's needed yet.

But according to the formula, α = (h c / λ) * (g_j/g_i) * (n_j - n_i). So n_j - n_i = α * λ / (h c (g_j/g_i)).

Wait, but we don't know g_j and g_i. Wait, helium-neon laser transition: from Ne^+ upper state to lower state. Neon has multiple energy levels. The upper state is typically a metastable state with statistical weight g_j, and the lower state has g_i.

Wait, for the Ne^+ transitions, the upper state (let's say 3s) has g_j = 2 (since s states have spin multiplicity 2S+1; s=0, so g=1? Wait no, wait, for 3s, l=0, so spin multiplicity is 2I+1. For electrons, spin 1/2, so 2I+1=2. So g_j=2.

The lower state might be the 1s state, which is also l=0, so g_i=2. So g_j/g_i = 1.

Wait, but sometimes in neon, the lower state is a different level. Let's think. The 3s to 1s transition in Ne^+ is a common laser transition. Both have g=2, so their ratio is 1. So (g_j/g_i) is 1.

So then, n_j - n_i = α * λ / (h c) * (g_i/g_j) → but since (g_j/g_i) is 1, it's just α * λ/(h c).

Plugging in the numbers:

α = 0.02 m^-1.

λ = 6328e-10 m.

h c = 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

So:

n_j - n_i = (0.02) * (6328e-10) / (1.9878e-25) 

Calculate numerator: 0.02 * 6328e-10 = 0.02 * 6.328e-7 = 1.2656e-8.

Denominator: 1.9878e-25.

So 1.2656e-8 / 1.9878e-25 ≈ 6.36e16.

Wait, that's 6.36e16 m^-3. But wait, the options are all around 1e18 to 1e19. Hmm, that's way lower than the options. Did I make a mistake?

Ah, wait, maybe I missed a factor. Because in some derivations, the inversion density N is given by N = (α * λ) / (h c * A_ij), where A_ij is the Einstein coefficient for spontaneous emission. Alternatively, perhaps the formula should include the Einstein coefficient.

Wait, another approach. The gain coefficient α is related to the inversion density N as α = (A_ij * h c / λ) * N * (g_j/g_i), assuming a four-level system.

Wait, because for a four-level system, the lower state is the ground state, so it's quickly depopulated. The inversion density N is n_j - n_i.

So rearranging, N = α / (A_ij * (h c / λ) * (g_j/g_i)).

But A_ij is 1/τ, which is 1e7 s^-1.

So let's plug in:

α = 0.02 m^-1.

A_ij = 1e7 s^-1.

h c / λ = 1.9878e-25 J·m / 6328e-10 m ≈ 3.14e-19 J.

But wait, more accurately, let's compute h c / λ again.

h = 6.626e-34 J·s

c = 3e8 m/s

λ = 6328e-10 m.

h c = 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

h c / λ = 1.9878e-25 / 6328e-10 = 1.9878e-25 / 6.328e-7 ≈ 3.14e-19 J.

So now, N = (0.02) / [1e7 * 3.14e-19 * (g_j/g_i)].

Since g_j/g_i is 1, it's 0.02 / (1e7 * 3.14e-19) = 0.02 / (3.14e-12) ≈ 6.369e9 m^-3.

That's way smaller than the options. Hmm, something's wrong here.

Wait, maybe I have the formula wrong. Another approach: the inversion density N is given by N = (α * λ) / (h c * A_ij * (g_j/g_i)).

Wait, let's see:

α = 0.02 m^-1.

λ = 6328e-10 m.

h c = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

A_ij = 1e7 s^-1.

g_j/g_i =1.

So N = (0.02 * 6328e-10) / (1.9878e-25 * 1e7 * 1)

Compute numerator: 0.02 * 6328e-10 = 1.2656e-8.

Denominator: 1.9878e-25 * 1e7 = 1.9878e-18.

So N = 1.2656e-8 / 1.9878e-18 ≈ 6.36e9 m^-3.

Again, same result, which is nowhere near the options. Wait, but the options are in 1e18 or higher. So I must have made a mistake in the formula.

Alternative approach: Maybe the formula is N = (α / (h c / λ)) * (1/(A_ij)).

Wait, let me think. The gain per unit length is α = (h c / λ) * (g_j/g_i) * (n_j - n_i) * (1/2) ?

Wait, another formula I found somewhere: N = (α * λ) / (h c * A_ij). Let's try that.

N = (0.02 * 6328e-10) / (6.626e-34 * 3e8 * 1e7).

Wait, wait, h c A_ij would be (6.626e-34 * 3e8) * 1e7 = 6.626e-34 * 3e15 = 1.9878e-18 J·s.

Wait, no, wait: A_ij is 1e7 s^-1, so h c = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Multiplying by A_ij: 1.9878e-25 * 1e7 = 1.9878e-18 J·m·s^-1.

Then, numerator: 0.02 m^-1 * 6328e-10 m = 0.02 * 6.328e-7 = 1.2656e-8.

So N = 1.2656e-8 / (1.9878e-18) ≈ 6.36e9 m^-3.

Same result again. But the options are much higher. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should consider that the gain constant α is given as 2% per meter, which is 0.02 m^-1, but perhaps I need to account for the fact that the gain is related to the population inversion multiplied by the transition probability.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is N = (α * λ) / (h c * (g_j/g_i) * A_ij).

Wait, let's compute that.

N = (0.02 * 6328e-10) / (6.626e-34 * 3e8 * (1) * 1e7).

Wait, denominator: 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25. Multiply by 1e7: 1.9878e-18.

So N = (0.02 * 6.328e-7) / (1.9878e-18) = (1.2656e-8) / (1.9878e-18) ≈ 6.36e9 m^-3.

Same result. Not matching options.

Wait, perhaps I'm using the wrong formula. Let me think differently. The population inversion density N is given by N = (g_j/g_i) * (n_j - n_i) = (g_j/g_i) * (n_j - n_i).

But how to find n_j -n_i.

Wait, another approach: The inversion density N is given by N = (α * λ) / (h c * A_ij).

So N = (0.02 * 6328e-10) / (6.626e-34 * 3e8 * 1e7).

Compute denominator: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25. Multiply by 1e7: 1.9878e-18.

Numerator: 0.02 * 6328e-10 = 1.2656e-8.

So N = 1.2656e-8 / 1.9878e-18 = 6.36e9 m^-3.

Still not matching. Maybe I'm missing a factor of something else.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the temperature. Oh, right, because the population distribution is affected by temperature. So using the Boltzmann factor, n_j = n_i * (g_j/g_i) * exp(-ΔE/(k T)).

But since we're looking for inversion, n_j > n_i. So (g_j/g_i) exp(-ΔE/(k T)) >1.

But how does that tie into the inversion density? Hmm.

Wait, alternatively, the inversion density can be found using the relation involving the transition lifetime and the pumping rate.

The population inversion N is given by N = (g_j/g_i) * (1 - exp(-ΔE/(k T))) * (n_i + n_j + ...).

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the Einstein coefficients and the rate equations.

The rate equations for a four-level system are:

dn_j/dt = (pumping rate) - (A_ij n_j + ... )

But this might get complicated. Alternatively, considering steady-state conditions, the rate of population in the upper state equals the rate of loss.

Wait, perhaps the inversion density N is given by N = (α * λ) / (h c * A_ij * (g_j/g_i)).

Wait, same as before, which gives 6.36e9, which is not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps the gain constant is given as 2% per meter, which is 0.02 m^-1, but perhaps I should include the cross-section or other factors. Or maybe the formula for gain is α = (h c / λ) * (g_j/g_i) * N.

So rearranged, N = α * λ / (h c (g_j/g_i)).

With g_j/g_i =1, N=0.02 *6328e-10 / (6.626e-34 *3e8).

Compute numerator: 0.02 *6328e-10 = 1.2656e-8.

Denominator: 6.626e-34 *3e8 =1.9878e-25.

So N=1.2656e-8 /1.9878e-25 ≈6.36e16 m^-3.

Wait, that's 6.36e16, which is 6.4e16, but the options are around 1e19. Hmm, that's still off by a factor of ~150.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in units. Let me double-check the units.

h c / λ: [J·m]/[m] = J.

So α (m^-1) * λ (m) gives dimensionless? No, because α is m^-1, so m^-1 * m = 1, so dimensionless.

Wait, but N has units of m^-3.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is N = (α * λ) / (h c) * (g_j/g_i) * (1/(A_ij)).

Wait, so N = (0.02 *6328e-10) / (6.626e-34 *3e8) * (1/(1e7)).

Wait, that would be:

0.02 *6.328e-7 =1.2656e-8.

Divide by (6.626e-34 *3e8) =1.9878e-25.

So 1.2656e-8 /1.9878e-25 =6.36e16.

Multiply by 1/(1e7): 6.36e16 *1e-7 =6.36e9 m^-3. Same as before.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for another approach. Alternatively, perhaps the formula involves the spontaneous emission lifetime τ. So, the Einstein coefficient A_ij = 1/τ. So A_ij = 1e7 s^-1.

The gain is given by α = (h c / λ) * (g_j/g_i) * (n_j -n_i) * (1/2), but I'm not sure about the factor. Alternatively, in some sources, the gain is α = (A_ij * h c / λ) * (n_j -n_i) * (g_j/g_i).

Wait, let me try that: α = A_ij * (h c / λ) * (g_j/g_i) * (n_j -n_i).

So rearranged, n_j -n_i = α / (A_ij * (h c / λ) * (g_j/g_i)).

Plugging in the numbers:

α=0.02 m^-1,

A_ij=1e7 s^-1,

h c / λ=3.14e-19 J,

g_j/g_i=1.

So denominator: 1e7 *3.14e-19 *1 =3.14e-12.

n_j -n_i =0.02 /3.14e-12 ≈6.36e9 m^-3.

Same result again. Not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the problem gives the lifetime as 1e-7 seconds, which is τ=1e-7 s. So A_ij=1/τ=1e7 s^-1, which I have used correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula involves the pump rate or the population of the lower state, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I'm missing a factor of 1e6 somewhere because of the units. Let's see: 6328 Å is 6.328e-7 m, but wait, I've been using 6328e-10 m. Wait, 6328 Å is 6328 *1e-10 m =6.328e-7 m. Oh wait, no! Wait, 1 Å is 1e-10 m. So 6328 Å =6328e-10 m=6.328e-7 m. So I think I made a mistake earlier in converting λ.

Wait, that's a big mistake! I think I messed up the exponent. So λ=6328e-10 m =6.328e-7 m. So earlier calculations used 6328e-10 as 6.328e-7, but in the initial calculation, I think I used 6.328e-10, which is wrong.

So redoing the calculations with λ=6.328e-7 m.

So h c =6.626e-34 *3e8 =1.9878e-25 J·m.

h c / λ =1.9878e-25 /6.328e-7 =3.14e-19 J.

Wait, no, 1.9878e-25 /6.328e-7 = approximately 3.14e-19 J.

Wait, let's compute it accurately:

1.9878e-25 /6.328e-7 = (1.9878 /6.328) * 1e-18 ≈ 0.314 *1e-18 =3.14e-19 J.

So now, using the correct λ, let's recompute N.

Using the formula N = (α * λ) / (h c * A_ij * (g_j/g_i)).

Plugging in:

α =0.02 m^-1,

λ=6.328e-7 m,

h c =1.9878e-25 J·m,

A_ij=1e7 s^-1,

g_j/g_i=1.

So N = (0.02 *6.328e-7) / (1.9878e-25 *1e7 *1).

Compute numerator: 0.02 *6.328e-7 =1.2656e-8.

Denominator:1.9878e-25 *1e7=1.9878e-18.

So N=1.2656e-8 /1.9878e-18 ≈6.36e9 m^-3.

Still same result. Hmm, but the options are way higher.

Wait, perhaps I'm using the wrong formula. Another approach: The inversion density can be found using the relation N = (α * λ) / (h c * A_ij * (g_j/g_i)).

Wait, same as before. But perhaps the correct formula is N = (α * λ) / (h c * (g_j/g_i) * A_ij). So same as earlier.

Hmm. I must be missing something. The answer isn't matching the options. Maybe the formula should include the statistical weights differently. Or perhaps the problem involves considering the excited state's population due to pumping.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for inversion density is N = (α * λ) / (h c * (g_j/g_i) * A_ij * L), but I'm not sure about L.

Wait, perhaps the formula is N = (α * λ) / (h c * A_ij), but I'm not considering the statistical weights. Let me try that.

N = (0.02 *6.328e-7) / (6.626e-34 *3e8 *1e7).

Compute denominator: 6.626e-34 *3e8=1.9878e-25. Multiply by 1e7:1.9878e-18.

Numerator:0.02 *6.328e-7=1.2656e-8.

So N=1.2656e-8 /1.9878e-18 ≈6.36e9 m^-3.

Same result. Not matching options.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the inversion density is given by N = (n_j -n_i) = (g_j/g_i) * (n_j -n_i) = N * (g_j/g_i), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is N = (α * λ) / (h c * (g_j/g_i) * A_ij * 1e6), considering some scaling factor. Let's try that.

So N = (0.02 *6.328e-7) / (6.626e-34 *3e8 *1e7 *1e6).

Wait, but that would make denominator even larger, leading to a smaller N, which is worse.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for a different approach. Alternatively, perhaps the formula involves the pump power or other factors, but the problem doesn't provide those.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the rate of population inversion. The rate at which the upper state is populated is related to the pumping and the loss rates.

The steady-state condition for the upper level is:

 pumping rate = A_ij * n_j + other loss terms.

Assuming four-level system, the lower level is quickly depopulated, so n_i ≈ n0, the ground state.

But without knowing n0, it's hard to proceed. Maybe another approach is needed.

Wait, another formula I found: The inversion density N is given by N = (α * λ) / (h c) * (1/(A_ij * (g_j/g_i))).

Which brings us back to the same calculation, giving 6.36e9 m^-3.

Hmm, given that the options are much higher, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck the numbers.

Wait, let me compute h c / λ again correctly.

h =6.626e-34 J·s,

c=3e8 m/s,

λ=6328e-10 m =6.328e-7 m.

h c =6.626e-34 *3e8 =1.9878e-25 J·m.

h c / λ =1.9878e-25 /6.328e-7 =3.14e-19 J.

Yes, that's correct.

So, using α=0.02 m^-1,

N = (0.02 *6.328e-7) / (3.14e-19 *1e7).

Wait, because A_ij=1e7 s^-1, so denominator is 3.14e-19 *1e7 =3.14e-12.

So N= (0.02 *6.328e-7) /3.14e-12.

Compute numerator: 0.02 *6.328e-7=1.2656e-8.

1.2656e-8 /3.14e-12 ≈4.03e3 m^-3.

No, that's even smaller. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the formula uses the reciprocal. Maybe N = (A_ij * (h c / λ)) / α.

So N= (1e7 *3.14e-19) /0.02.

Compute numerator:1e7 *3.14e-19=3.14e-12.

3.14e-12 /0.02=1.57e-10 m^-3. No, that's way too small.

I'm really stuck here. The calculation isn't matching the options, and I can't figure out where I'm going wrong. Maybe I should make an educated guess based on the options.

Wait, looking at the options, the closest I can get is option H: 1e19, but my calculation doesn't reach that. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the exponent for λ.

Wait, if I mistakenly used 6328e-9 m (nanometers) instead of 6328e-10 m (angstroms), let's see what happens.

λ=6328e-9 m=6.328e-6 m.

Then h c / lambda=1.9878e-25 /6.328e-6=3.14e-20 J.

Now, using N=(0.02 *6.328e-6)/(1.9878e-25 *1e7).

Numerator:0.02 *6.328e-6=1.2656e-7.

Denominator:1.9878e-25 *1e7=1.9878e-18.

So N=1.2656e-7 /1.9878e-18 ≈6.36e10 m^-3.

Still not matching options. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the formula should have (g_j + g_i) instead of (g_j/g_i), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's (g_j + g_i) * (n_j - n_i).

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for inversion density is N = (g_j/g_i) * (n_j -n_i) = (g_j/g_i) * N.

But without knowing n_j and n_i separately, I can't proceed.

I think I'm stuck. Given the options, perhaps the correct answer is option H: 1e19, but my calculations don't reach that. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in considering the correct formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula is N = (α * λ) / (h c) * (1/(A_ij * (g_j/g_i))).

So N= (0.02 *6.328e-7)/(6.626e-34*3e8) * (1/(1e7)).

Compute denominator:6.626e-34*3e8=1.9878e-25.

So (0.02 *6.328e-7)=1.2656e-8.

1.2656e-8 /1.9878e-25=6.36e16.

Divide by 1e7:6.36e9.

Same result. Hmm.

I think I'll have to go with the calculation I have, but since it doesn't match the options, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Alternatively, the correct answer might be option H:1e19, but I'm not confident.

To calculate the inversion density \( n_j - n_i \) for a helium-neon laser operating at a wavelength of 6328 Å, the following steps were considered:

1. **Key Formula**: The inversion density \( n_j - n_i \) is related to the gain constant \( \alpha \), wavelength \( \lambda \), Planck's constant \( h \), speed of light \( c \), and the Einstein coefficient \( A_{ij} \) (related to the lifetime \( \tau \)) through the formula:

   n_j - n_i = \frac{\alpha \cdot \lambda}{h \cdot c \cdot A_{ij}} \cdot \frac{g_j}{g_i}
   \]

2. **Given Values**:
   - \( \alpha = 2\% \text{ per meter} = 0.02 \, \text{m}^{-1} \)
   - \( \lambda = 6328 \, \text{Å} = 6328 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} = 6.328 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m} \)
   - \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \)
   - \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \)
   - \( \tau = 10^{-7} \, \text{s} \implies A_{ij} = \frac{1}{\tau} = 1 \times 10^7 \, \text{s}^{-1} \)
   - \( g_j/g_i = 1 \) (statistical weights for the upper and lower states are equal).

3. **Calculation**:
   - Compute \( h \cdot c \):
     \[
     h \cdot c = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \cdot 3 \times 10^8 = 1.9878 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{J·m}
     \]
   - Compute \( h \cdot c / \lambda \):
     \[
     \frac{h \cdot c}{\lambda} = \frac{1.9878 \times 10^{-25}}{6.328 \times 10^{-7}} \approx 3.14 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}
     \]
   - Rearrange the formula for \( n_j - n_i \):
     \[
     n_j - n_i = \frac{\alpha \cdot \lambda}{h \cdot c \cdot A_{ij}}
     \]
   - Substitute values:
     \[
     n_j - n_i = \frac{0.02 \cdot 6.328 \times 10^{-7}}{1.9878 \times 10^{-25} \cdot 1 \times 10^7}
     \]
   - Compute numerator:
     \[
     0.02 \cdot 6.328 \times 10^{-7} = 1.2656 \times 10^{-8}
     \]
   - Compute denominator:
     \[
     1.9878 \times 10^{-25} \cdot 1 \times 10^7 = 1.9878 \times 10^{-18}
     \]
   - Divide:
     \[
     n_j - n_i = \frac{1.2656 \times 10^{-8}}{1.9878 \times 10^{-18}} \approx 6.36 \times 10^9 \, \text{m}^{-3}
     \]

4. **Discrepancy**:
   The calculated inversion density \( 6.36 \times 10^9 \, \text{m}^{-3} \) is significantly lower than the options provided, which are on the order of \( 10^{18} \, \text{m}^{-3} \). This suggests a potential error in the formula, units, or interpretation of the problem. However, based on the given options and the reasoning provided, the closest match appears to be **H: \( 1 \times 10^{19} \, \text{m}^{-3} \)**.

ANSWER: H
