Question:

An experiment was designed to test the effects of three different types of paint on the durability of wooden toys. Because boys and girls tend to play differently with toys, a randomly selected group of children was divided into two groups by sex. Which of the following statements about this experiment is true?

Options:

A: There are only three treatment combinations in this experiment.
B: This is a completely randomized design.
C: The sex of the children does not affect the experiment results.
D: Sex is a blocking factor.
E: The type of wooden toys is a blocking factor.
F: Type of paint is a blocking factor.
G: The durability of toys is a blocking factor.
H: This experiment does not have any blocking factors.

Answer:

Alright, so I've got this multiple-choice question here about an experiment involving paint types on wooden toys. Let me try to break it down.

The experiment is testing three different types of paint. The setup mentions that boys and girls play differently, so they took a random group of kids and split them into two groups based on sex. Hmm, okay. So the main variable here is the type of paint, which I assume is the independent variable. But then why split by sex?

I remember something about blocking in experimental design. Blocking is when you group subjects based on certain characteristics to reduce variability. Like, if you're testing a drug but some people have a condition that might affect the outcome, you'd block them by that condition. So in this case, since boys and girls play differently, which could influence how the toys wear, they're using sex as a blocking factor. That makes sense because it accounts for potential differences in how each group interacts with the toys, thus making the experiment more controlled and the results more reliable.

Now looking at the options:

A: There are only three treatment combinations. Wait, the experiment has three types of paint. If they're blocking by sex, then each paint type is applied to both groups. So each paint is tested on boys and girls. That would mean 3 paints * 2 sexes = 6 treatment combinations. So A is not correct.

B: Completely randomized design. No, because they're blocking by sex, it's not completely randomized. A completely randomized design doesn't use blocking, so B is wrong.

C: Sex doesn't affect results. But the question says they specifically split by sex because it does affect how toys are played with, so C is incorrect.

D: Sex is a blocking factor. Yeah, that aligns with what I was thinking earlier. So D seems correct.

E: Type of wooden toys is a blocking factor. No, the blocking here is by sex, not the toy type. The toy type is probably consistent across all treatments, so E is wrong.

F: Paint type is a blocking factor. No, paint is the treatment variable, not a block. Blocking factors are variables you control to minimize variability, not the main effect you're testing.

G: Durability is a blocking factor. That doesn't make sense. Durability is the dependent variable, the outcome being measured. Blocking factors are independent variables used as groups.

H: No blocking factors. That can't be right because they split by sex, which is a blocking factor.

So the correct answer should be D.

The experiment involves testing three types of paint on the durability of wooden toys, with children divided into two groups by sex due to differences in play behavior. This setup uses sex as a blocking factor to account for variability in how boys and girls interact with toys, improving the experiment's control and reliability. 

- **A**: Incorrect, as there are 3 paint types and 2 sexes, leading to 6 treatment combinations.  
- **B**: Incorrect, as the design is not completely randomized; it uses blocking.  
- **C**: Incorrect, as the question states that sex affects play behavior.  
- **D**: Correct, as sex is used to block and reduce variability.  
- **E**: Incorrect, as the type of wooden toys is not mentioned as a blocking factor.  
- **F**: Incorrect, as paint type is the treatment variable, not a block.  
- **G**: Incorrect, as durability is the dependent variable, not a block.  
- **H**: Incorrect, as sex is a blocking factor.  

The correct answer is **D**.
