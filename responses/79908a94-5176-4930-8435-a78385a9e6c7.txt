Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here about ordering numbers from least to greatest. The options are labeled A through J, each with a sequence of four numbers. My task is to figure out which option has the numbers correctly ordered.

First, let me understand what each number is. The numbers given are 0.75, 5/6, 1/8, and 1/3. I need to convert all of these into decimal form to compare them easily.

Starting with 5/6. I know that 5 divided by 6 is approximately 0.8333... because 6 goes into 5 zero times, add a decimal, 6 into 50 is 8 (since 6*8=48), remainder 2, then bring down a zero to make 20. 6 goes into 20 three times (6*3=18), remainder 2 again. So it repeats, making it 0.8333...

Next, 1/8. That's easy because I remember that 1/8 is 0.125. So that's straightforward.

Then, 1/3. That's approximately 0.3333..., repeating forever. So that's about 0.333.

And 0.75 is already a decimal, so that's easy.

Now, let me list all these decimals:

- 0.75 is 0.75
- 5/6 ≈ 0.8333
- 1/8 = 0.125
- 1/3 ≈ 0.3333

So, in order from least to greatest, I need to arrange them as 0.125, 0.3333, 0.75, 0.8333.

Wait, let me check that again. The smallest is 0.125 (1/8), then 0.3333 (1/3), then 0.75, and finally 5/6 at about 0.8333. So the correct order should be 1/8, 1/3, 0.75, 5/6.

Now, I need to look at each option and see which one matches this sequence.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 0.75, 5/6, 1/8, 1/3 → No, because 1/8 is the smallest and it's third here.

Option B: 1/8, 1/3, 0.75, 5/6 → Yes, this matches exactly what I found.

Option C: 1/8, 0.75, 1/3, 5/6 → No, because after 1/8, 0.75 is larger than 1/3, which is incorrect.

Option D: 5/6, 1/3, 0.75, 1/8 → No, starts with the largest, which is wrong.

Option E: 0.75, 1/8, 1/3, 5/6 → No, because 1/8 should come before 1/3, but here it's after 0.75, which is incorrect.

Option F: 5/6, 1/8, 1/3, 0.75 → No, starts with the largest and then has 1/8, which is correct, but then 1/3 comes after, which is higher than 1/8 but lower than 0.75.

Wait, let me check F again: 5/6 is first, which is wrong because it's the largest. Then 1/8 (0.125), then 1/3 (0.333), then 0.75. So the order would be 5/6, 1/8, 1/3, 0.75. That's not correct because 1/3 is less than 0.75 but more than 1/8, so the correct order after 1/8 should be 1/3, then 0.75, then 5/6. So F is wrong.

Option G: 1/8, 0.75, 5/6, 1/3 → No, because 1/3 is 0.333, which is less than 0.75, so it shouldn't come after 5/6.

Option H: 1/3, 0.75, 1/8, 5/6 → No, because 1/8 is smaller than 1/3, so it shouldn't come after 0.75.

Option I: 1/3, 1/8, 0.75, 5/6 → No, because 1/8 is smaller than 1/3, so the order is wrong here.

Option J: 5/6, 0.75, 1/3, 1/8 → No, starts with 5/6, which is the largest, and then 0.75, then 1/3, then 1/8. That's completely wrong.

So, the only option that correctly orders from least to greatest is option B: 1/8, 1/3, 0.75, 5/6.

The correct order is 1/8 (0.125), 1/3 (0.3333), 0.75, and 5/6 (0.8333). Option B matches this sequence.
