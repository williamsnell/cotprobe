Okay, so I have this logic problem to solve. The question is about translating the sentence "All children go to some school." into predicate logic. The options are labeled A through J, and I need to pick the best one. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I should understand what the original sentence means. "All children go to some school" implies that for every child, there exists at least one school that the child attends. So, in other words, every child is a student at some school.

Next, I'll look at the predicates given. Cx means "x is a child," Sx means "x is a school," and Gxy means "x goes to y." So, I need to structure this in predicate logic.

The sentence is a universal statement because it says "all children." So, I should start with a universal quantifier, which is ∀x. Then, for each x, if x is a child (Cx), then there exists a school y such that x goes to y (Gxy). 

Putting it together, it should be something like: For all x, if x is a child, then there exists a y such that y is a school and x goes to y. So, in symbols, that would be ∀x (Cx → ∃y (Sy ∧ Gxy)).

Now, looking at the options, I need to see which one matches this structure.

Option J is: (∀x)[Cx ⊃ (∃y)(Sy • Gxy)]. Let me parse this. The outer part is a universal quantifier, so for all x, if Cx (x is a child) then there exists a y such that Sy and Gxy. That seems exactly like what I have in mind. 

Wait, let me check the other options to be sure.

Option A: (∀x)(∃y)[(Cx • Sy) • Gxy). This seems to say that for every x and some y, x is a child, y is a school, and x goes to y. But the issue here is that it's using a conjunction (•) which is like an AND, meaning both Cx and Sy are true for the same x and y. But that's not quite right because x being a child doesn't necessarily make y a school, but rather, y is a school that x attends. So, the structure here might be incorrect because it's combining Cx and Sy with Gxy, but the implication is that x is a child, and there's a y that's a school where x goes. So, I think A might not be the correct structure.

Option B: (∀x)[Cx • (∃y)(Sy ⊃ Gxy)]. This translates to for all x, x is a child and there exists a y such that if y is a school, then x goes to y. This seems a bit off because the structure is that x is a child, but the existence of y is tied to Sy implying Gxy. It feels like the order is mixed up. It should be that the child implies there exists a school, not that the school implies the child goes there.

Option C: (∀x)[Sx ⊃ (∃y)(Cy • Gxy)]. This says for all x, if x is a school, then there exists a y which is a child and y goes to x. So this is the opposite of what we want. We want children to go to schools, not schools to have children.

Option D: (∀x)(∃y)[(Sx • Cy) • Gxy]. This looks similar to A but with Sx and Cy. So, for all x and some y, x is a school, y is a child, and y goes to x. Again, the problem is that it's combining Sx and Cy with Gxy, which isn't the right structure because the subject is children, not schools.

Option E: (∀x)(∃y)[(Cx ⊃ Sy) • Gxy]. This would mean that for every x and some y, if x is a child, then y is a school, and x goes to y. The issue here is that the implication (Cx ⊃ Sy) is part of the conjunction, which might not correctly capture the intended meaning. Also, the structure might be misplacing the quantifiers.

Option F: (∀x)(∃y)[(Cx • Sy) ⊃ Gxy). This seems to say that for all x and some y, if x is a child and y is a school, then x goes to y. But the way it's structured, the implication is within the scope of both universal and existential quantifiers, which might not correctly capture the intended meaning. Also, the order of quantifiers might be incorrect because the inner part is dependent on both x and y, which isn't right.

Option G: (∀x)[Sx ⊃ (∃y)(Cy ⊃ Gxy)]. This is saying that for all x, if x is a school, then there exists a y such that if y is a child, then y goes to x. Again, it's about schools having children, which isn't what we want. We want children attending schools.

Option H: (∀x)[Sx • (∃y)(Cy • Gxy)]. This is saying that for all x, x is a school and there exists a y such that y is a child and y goes to x. So, every school has at least one child attending it. But the original statement is about all children going to some school, not about schools having children. So, H is the converse of what we need.

Option I: (∃x)(∀y)[(Cx • Sy) • Gxy]. This is an existential quantifier for x, meaning there exists an x such that for all y, x is a child, y is a school, and x goes to y. That would mean there's a single child who goes to every school, which is not what the original sentence says. The original is about all children going to some school, so this is more restrictive and incorrect.

So, after going through each option, the correct structure is in Option J: (∀x)[Cx ⊃ (∃y)(Sy • Gxy)]. This correctly states that for every child x, there exists a school y such that x goes to y. The structure matches the original sentence, ensuring that every child is accounted for and that each has at least one school they attend.

The correct translation is ∀x (Cx → ∃y (Sy ∧ Gxy)), which corresponds to option J.
