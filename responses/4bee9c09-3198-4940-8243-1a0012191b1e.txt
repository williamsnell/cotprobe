Okay, so I've got this question about disk units and calculating the percentage of occupied tracks. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through step by step.

The question says that a disk unit uses a bit string where 0 is vacant and 1 is occupied. A 32-bit segment of this string has the hexadecimal value D4FE2003. I need to find the percentage of occupied tracks, rounded to the nearest percent.

First, I remember that hexadecimal is base 16, and each hex digit represents 4 bits. So, a 32-bit string would be 8 hex digits because 32 divided by 4 is 8. Wait, wait, but the value given is D4FE2003. Let me count the digits: D,4,F,E,2,0,0,3. Yep, that's 8 digits, so it's a full 32 bits. Good.

Now, I need to convert this hex string into binary to count how many 1s there are because each 1 represents an occupied track. So, each hex digit becomes four binary digits. Let me break it down:

D -> 1101
4 -> 0100
F -> 1111
E -> 1110
2 -> 0010
0 -> 0000
0 -> 0000
3 -> 0011

So putting it all together, the binary string would be:

1101 0100 1111 1110 0010 0000 0000 0011

Let me check that I've converted each correctly:

D: 13 in decimal is 1101. Correct.
4: 4 in decimal is 0100. Right.
F: 15 is 1111. Yep.
E: 14 is 1110. Correct.
2: 2 is 0010. Yes.
0: 0 is 0000. So two 0s here.
3: 3 is 0011. Correct.

Now, I'll write out the entire binary string without spaces:

11010100111111100010000000000011

Now, I need to count how many 1s are in this 32-bit string. Let me go through each bit and count.

Let's break it into parts to make it easier. I'll count each 4-bit segment as I go.

First 4 bits: 1101 → 3 ones.
Next 4: 0100 → 1 one.
Next: 1111 → 4 ones.
Next: 1110 → 3 ones.
Next: 0010 → 1 one.
Next two groups of 4: 0000 and 0000 → 0 ones each.
Last 4: 0011 → 2 ones.

So adding them up: 3 + 1 +4 +3 +1 +0 +0 +2 = let's see, 3+1 is 4, +4 is 8, +3 is 11, +1 is 12, then +2 is 14. Wait, that doesn't sound right. Let me recount each part carefully to avoid mistakes.

Let me list each group's count:

1. 1101 → 3
2. 0100 → 1
3. 1111 →4
4. 1110 →3
5. 0010 →1
6. 0000 →0
7. 0000 →0
8. 0011 →2

Adding these: 3+1=4; 4+4=8; +3=11; +1=12; +0=12; +0=12; +2=14. So total of 14 ones.

Wait, but 32 bits with 14 ones would mean 14/32 = 0.4375, which is 43.75% which rounds to 44%. Looking at the options, G is 44%, so that's the answer.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check the binary conversion because maybe I made a mistake there. Let me write each hex digit's 4 bits again:

D → 1101
4 → 0100
F → 1111
E → 1110
2 → 0010
0 → 0000
0 → 0000
3 → 0011

Putting it all together as a string:

1101 0100 1111 1110 0010 0000 0000 0011

So the binary string is:

1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1

Now, let me count the 1s again.

Starting from the beginning:

1 (1)
1 (2)
0
1 (3)
0
1 (4)
0
0
1 (5)
1 (6)
1 (7)
1 (8)
1 (9)
1 (10)
0 (11)
1 (12)
0
0
1 (13)
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
1 (14)
1 (15)
Wait, that's 15 ones. Oh no, I think I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, wait, when I broke it into 4-bit groups, I might have miscounted. Let me recount without grouping.

Looking at the entire 32-bit string:

1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1

Let's count each 1:

1: positions 1, 2, 4, 6, 9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,18,29,30,31,32? Wait, no. Wait, let me number them from 1 to 32.

Let me list each bit's position and whether it's 1:

1:1
2:1
3:0
4:1
5:0
6:1
7:0
8:0
9:1
10:1
11:1
12:1
13:1
14:1
15:1
16:0
17:0
18:1
19:0
20:0
21:0
22:0
23:0
24:0
25:0
26:0
27:0
28:0
29:1
30:1
31:0
32:0

Wait, no, because the last part is 0011, which would be bits 30,31,32 as 0,0,1,1? Wait, maybe I'm getting the order wrong.

Wait, the hex string is D4FE2003. So each pair is a byte. So maybe I should break it into bytes and check each.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm miscounting because I'm not considering the correct order. Let me try again.

Let me write the entire 32-bit string as a single line without spaces:

11010100111111100010000000000011

Now, let me count each '1' in this string.

I'll go through each character:

1 (1)
1 (2)
0
1 (3)
0
1 (4)
0
0
1 (5)
1 (6)
1 (7)
1 (8)
1 (9)
1 (10)
0
0
0
1 (11)
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
1 (12)
1 (13)

Wait, that's 13 ones. Wait, that's conflicting with my earlier counts. Hmm, I'm getting confused.

Let me count the number of '1's in the string:

Looking at the string: 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1

So let's count each '1':

1: position 1 →1
2: position 2 →2
4: position4 →3
6: position6 →4
9: position9 →5
10: position10 →6
11: position11 →7
12: position12 →8
13: position13 →9
14: position14 →10
15: position15 →11
18: position18 →12
29: position29 →13
30: position30 →14
31: position31 →15? Wait, no, because the string is 32 bits.

Wait, the string is 32 bits, so positions 1 to 32.

Let me list each bit:

1:1
2:1
3:0
4:1
5:0
6:1
7:0
8:0
9:1
10:1
11:1
12:1
13:1
14:1
15:1
16:0
17:0
18:1
19:0
20:0
21:0
22:0
23:0
24:0
25:0
26:0
27:0
28:0
29:1
30:1
31:1? Wait no, the last four bits are 0011, which would be bits 29,30,31,32 as 0,0,1,1.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the order wrong. Hex digits are grouped as two hex digits per byte, and each byte is 8 bits. So D4FE2003 would be four bytes: D4, FE, 20, 03.

Wait, but perhaps I should consider each byte as two hex digits, which make 8 bits. So let me break the hex string into four bytes:

First byte: D4 → D is 1101, 4 is 0100 → 11010100
Second byte: FE → F is 1111, E is 1110 →11111110
Third byte: 20 →2 is 0010, 0 is 0000 →00100000
Fourth byte: 03 →0 is 0000, 3 is 0011 →00000011

Wait, but that makes the 32-bit string as:

11010100 11111110 00100000 00000011

Which when written as a single string is:

11010100111111100010000000000011

Now, let's count the 1s in each byte.

First byte: 11010100 → bits: 1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0 → 1s at positions 1,2,4,6 → 4 ones.

Second byte: 11111110 → seven 1s and a 0 → 7 ones.

Third byte: 00100000 → only the third bit is 1 → 1 one.

Fourth byte: 00000011 → two 1s at the end → 2 ones.

Now, adding them up: 4 +7 +1 +2 = 14 ones.

So 14 ones out of 32 bits. So the fraction is 14/32 = 0.4375, which is 43.75%. Rounded to the nearest percent is 44%, which is option G.

But earlier I thought I had 13 or 15 ones, but breaking it into bytes makes it clearer. So the correct count is 14 ones. Therefore, 14/32 = 43.75% → 44%.
</think>

The hexadecimal value D4FE2003 is converted into a 32-bit binary string. Each hex digit is broken into 4 bits, resulting in the binary string:

11010100 11111110 00100000 00000011

Counting the number of '1's in this string yields 14 ones. The percentage of occupied tracks is calculated as \( \frac{14}{32} \times 100 = 43.75\% \), which rounds to 44%. 

Answer: G
