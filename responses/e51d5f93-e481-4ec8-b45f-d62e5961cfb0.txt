Okay, so I've got this question about emission spectra of Li++ and hydrogen. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my atomic structure, but let me think this through.

Alright, the question says that the emission spectrum of doubly ionized lithium (Li++) is identical to that of a hydrogen atom in terms of all wavelengths. So, I need to find out by what factor the wavelengths change.

Wait, Li++ is doubly ionized. That means it has lost two electrons. Lithium has an atomic number Z of 3, so Li++ would have Z=3, but with two electrons removed, meaning it's now a helium ion, He+. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, Li has Z=3, so Li++ would have lost two electrons, so it has only one electron left. Because neutral Li has three electrons, so Li++ is +2 charge, so one electron left.

And the hydrogen atom has Z=1. So, the emission spectrum here—emission lines come from electrons transitioning between energy levels. The formula for the wavelength of emitted light is given by the Rydberg formula: 1/λ = R*(1/n1² - 1/n2²), where R is the Rydberg constant, and n1 and n2 are the principal quantum numbers, with n2 > n1.

But wait, the Rydberg formula for hydrogen is 1/λ = R*(1/(n1²) - 1/(n2²)). For hydrogen, Z=1. For Li++, which is Li^2+ (Z=3), but since it has only one electron left, it's similar to hydrogen but with a higher Z.

Ah, right! The Rydberg formula for hydrogen-like atoms (like He+, Li++, etc.) is 1/λ = R*Z²*(1/(n1²) - 1/(n2²)). So the wavelength λ is inversely proportional to Z squared. Because if Z increases, the energy levels are more closely spaced, leading to shorter wavelengths for the same transitions.

So comparing Li++ (Z=3) to hydrogen (Z=1), the Rydberg constant for Li++ would be scaled by Z², so 3² =9. So the wavelength for Li++ would be λ_Li = λ_H / Z² = λ_H /9.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. Because for emission, the wavelength is given by 1/λ = R*Z²*(1/n1² - 1/n2²). So the wavelength λ = 1/(R*Z²*(...)). So if Z increases, λ decreases because it's in the denominator.

Wait, but the problem states that the emission spectrum of Li++ is identical to that of hydrogen. That can't be right because Z is different. Oh wait, no. The question says the wavelengths are scaled by a factor. So the emission lines of Li++ are the same as hydrogen's lines scaled by some factor.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the emission lines of Li++ (Z=3) are the same as those of hydrogen if we adjust for Z. So what factor would make the wavelengths match? Let me think.

The Rydberg formula for hydrogen is λ_H = 1/(R*(1/n1² - 1/n2²)). For Li++, it's λ_Li = 1/(R*(3²)*(1/n1² - 1/n2²)) ) = 1/(9 R (1/n1² - 1/n2²)) ). So λ_Li = λ_H /9.

Wait, that would mean that the wavelengths of Li++ are 1/9th of hydrogen's. So if the emission spectrum of Li++ is the same as hydrogen, then each wavelength λ_Li must be λ_H divided by 9. So the wavelengths are decreased by a factor of 9. Which would mean the wavelengths are shorter by a factor of 9.

Wait, but the options don't have a 'decreased by a factor of 9' as an option. Wait, looking back at the options: Option I is 'decreased by a factor of 9' and option J is 'decreased by a factor of 49'.

Wait, no, wait. Let me double-check. The problem states that the emission spectrum of Li++ is identical to that of hydrogen when all the wavelengths are adjusted by a factor. So the correct scaling factor would make the wavelengths of Li++ match those of hydrogen.

So if for Li++, λ_Li = λ_H / 9, then for the emission spectrum to be identical, the wavelengths of Li++ must be multiplied by 9 to get hydrogen's. Because if Li++ has λ = λ_H /9, then to make them same, you'd scale λ_Li by 9 to get λ_H.

Wait, no. Let me think differently. Suppose the emission lines of Li++ have wavelengths that are λ_Li = λ_H^(H) * factor. So the question is, what factor would make the emission lines the same.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the spectrum of Li++ is the same as hydrogen when you scale the wavelengths. So the wavelengths are scaled by a factor. So if Li++'s λ is λ_Li = λ_H / Z², which is λ_H /9. So if someone were to take hydrogen's spectrum and scale all wavelengths by 9, they would get Li++'s spectrum. So the factor is increased by a factor of 9, because each wavelength is longer by 9 times. Wait, no. Wait, if Li++ has shorter wavelengths, then to get Li++'s spectrum from hydrogen's, you have to decrease each wavelength by 1/9, which is scaling down by 9. Wait, I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the wavelengths of Li++ are 1/9th of hydrogen's. So if you have a hydrogen line at λ, Li++ would have a line at λ/9. So to make Li++'s spectrum match hydrogen's, you would have to multiply each wavelength by 9. So the wavelengths are increased by a factor of 9. Because Li++'s λ is smaller, so to make it same as H's, you scale up.

Wait, but that would mean the emission lines for Li++ are shorter. So if the question says that the emission spectrum is identical, implying that when you adjust the wavelengths by a factor, they match. So the factor would be the ratio of the wavelengths.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the Rydberg formula. For hydrogen, 1/λ_H = R*(1/n1² -1/n2²). For Li++, 1/λ_Li = R*(3^2)*(1/n1² -1/n2²) )= 9 R (1/n1² -1/n2²). So 1/λ_Li = 9*(1/λ_H). So λ_Li = λ_H /9.

So for the emission spectrum of Li++ to be identical to H's, each wavelength λ_Li must be equal to λ_H divided by 9. So the wavelengths in Li++ are shorter by a factor of 9. So the wavelengths are decreased by a factor of 9. So if a wavelength in H is λ, in Li++ it's λ/9. So to get the same emission lines, you have to multiply each H wavelength by 1/9 to get Li++'s. So the emission lines of H would have to be scaled down by 9 to match Li++.

Wait, but the question says the emission spectrum of Li++ is identical to that of H when all wavelengths are... So the scaling factor is applied to H's wavelengths to get Li++'s. So the scaling factor would be 1/9, meaning the wavelengths are decreased by a factor of 9. So the correct answer would be option I: decreased by a factor of 9.

Wait, but looking back at the options, option I is 'decreased by a factor of 9', which would mean that if you decrease H's wavelengths by 9 times, you get Li++'s. But no, the question says that the emission spectrum of Li++ is identical to H's when all the wavelengths are... So I think the factor is how much you have to change H's wavelengths to match Li++.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is phrased as: the emission spectrum of Li++ has the same lines as H, but scaled by a factor. So each wavelength λ_Li = λ_H * factor.

From earlier, λ_Li = λ_H /9. So the factor is 1/9, meaning each wavelength is 1/9th of H's. So to get Li++'s spectrum from H's, you multiply each H wavelength by 1/9. But the question is phrased as the emission spectrum of Li++ is identical to H's when all wavelengths are... so the scaling factor would be 1/9. So the wavelengths are decreased by a factor of 9.

So looking at the options, option I is 'decreased by a factor of 9', which would be the correct answer.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit tangled up here. Let me think about it another way. For hydrogen, the wavelength is λ_H. For Li++, since Z is 3, the wavelength is λ_Li = λ_H / Z² = λ_H /9. So if you want the spectrum of Li++ to look like H's, you have to multiply each λ_Li by 9 to get λ_H. So the scaling factor for the wavelengths is 9 times larger. So the wavelengths would be increased by a factor of 9. Wait, wait—this is confusing.

Alternatively, when you see the emission spectrum of Li++, it's as if you're looking at H's spectrum scaled down by 9. So if you take H's spectrum and scale down each wavelength by 9, you get Li++'s. So the wavelengths in Li++ are 1/9th of H's. So the factor is 9 times smaller, meaning the wavelengths are decreased by a factor of 9. So option I.

Wait, but let's think about a real example. The Balmer series in hydrogen has a wavelength of about 656 nm (red). For Li++, which is a hydrogen-like ion with Z=3, the Balmer transition would be from n=2 to n=1. The formula gives λ = 1/(R*(3²)*(1/1² - 1/4)) ). Let me compute that.

R is approximately 1.097e7 m^-1. So 1/(R *9*(1 - 0.25)) = 1/(9 R * 0.75) = 1/(6.75 R). For hydrogen, the Balmer wavelength is about 656 nm, which is 1/(R*(1/4 - 1)) = 1/(R*(-3/4)), wait, no, the formula is 1/λ = R*(1/n1² - 1/n2²), so for Balmer in hydrogen, n1=2, n2=1. So 1/λ_H = R*(1/4 -1) = R*(-3/4), which can't be right. Oh wait, n2 has to be higher than n1, so for emission, n2>n1. So maybe I should have n1=1 and n2=2 for Lyman series. Wait, no, the Balmer series is n1=2, n2=3,4,5 etc. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, let me get back. The point is that for hydrogen, the wavelength is λ_H, and for Li++, it's λ_Li = λ_H/(Z²) = λ_H/9. So the wavelength is shorter by a factor of 9.

So if the question is that the emission spectrum of Li++ is identical to that of hydrogen when all the wavelengths are adjusted by a factor, that factor would be 1/9. So the wavelengths are decreased by a factor of 9. So the correct option is I: decreased by a factor of 9.

The emission spectrum of doubly ionized lithium (Li++) is identical to that of a hydrogen atom when all the wavelengths are adjusted by a factor. Li++ has a nuclear charge \( Z = 3 \), while hydrogen has \( Z = 1 \). The Rydberg formula for hydrogen-like atoms is:

\[
\frac{1}{\lambda} = R \cdot Z^2 \left( \frac{1}{n_1^2} - \frac{1}{n_2^2} \right),
\]

where \( R \) is the Rydberg constant, and \( n_1 \) and \( n_2 \) are the principal quantum numbers. For Li++, the wavelength \( \lambda_{\text{Li}} \) is inversely proportional to \( Z^2 \), meaning:

\[
\lambda_{\text{Li}} = \frac{\lambda_{\text{H}}}{Z^2} = \frac{\lambda_{\text{H}}}{9}.
\]

This shows that the wavelengths of Li++ are shorter by a factor of 9 compared to hydrogen. Therefore, to make the emission spectrum of Li++ identical to that of hydrogen, the wavelengths must be scaled by a factor of 9. Specifically, the wavelengths of Li++ are decreased by a factor of 9 to match those of hydrogen.

The correct answer is:

**I: decreased by a factor of 9**
