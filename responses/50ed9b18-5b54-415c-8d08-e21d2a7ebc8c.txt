Okay, so I need to figure out which consequentialist theory Dershowitz thinks can justify terrorism in certain extreme cases. Let me start by breaking down the question and the options provided.

First, I know that consequentialist theories are those that determine the morality of an action based on its outcomes or consequences. The main types I remember are utilitarianism and hedonism, which can be either act-based or rule-based. There's also egoism, which focuses on self-interest, and relativism, which says that moral truths are relative to cultures or individuals.

Dershowitz is a legal philosopher, and I recall that he has discussed the ethics of terrorism, particularly in the context of extreme situations. He's argued that in some very extreme cases, even if terrorism causes harm, it might be justified if the overall consequences are better. This suggests a form of consequentialism because he's focusing on the outcomes.

Now, looking at the options:

A: Deontological ethics – This is non-consequentialist, focusing on duties and rules. So probably not this.

B: Rule-based hedonism – This is a type of hedonism that follows rules to maximize happiness. But I'm not sure if Dershowitz uses this specifically.

C: Act-based deontology – Again, deontological, so not a consequentialist approach.

D: Egoistic hedonism – Self-interested hedonism, but I don't think Dershowitz's view aligns with pure self-interest.

E: Moral relativism – This says morality is relative, not a universal theory, so maybe, but I don't think it's what Dershowitz is advocating here.

F: Act utilitarianism – This is about each individual action being judged by its utility, maximizing overall happiness.

G: Rule utilitarianism – Focuses on following rules that maximize happiness, rather than each individual act.

H: Rule egoism – Rules based on self-interest, not necessarily the greater good.

I: Virtue ethics – Focuses on character rather than consequences, so not applicable.

J: Act-based hedonism – Each act is evaluated for its immediate happiness.

Dershowitz's argument seems to hinge on the consequences of specific actions. He's not necessarily saying that there are general rules that should always be followed, but rather that in extreme cases, the outcome justifies the action. So this sounds more like act utilitarianism (F), where each action is evaluated based on its utility.

Wait, but I should double-check. Act utilitarianism is about the consequences of each individual act, whereas rule utilitarianism is about following rules that lead to the best consequences. Dershowitz's case might be more about the specific outcomes rather than adhering to rules. So F seems right.

I think the answer is F: act utilitarianism.

The correct answer is F: act utilitarianism. Dershowitz's reasoning aligns with act utilitarianism, which evaluates the morality of each action based on its consequences, particularly in extreme cases where the outcomes might justify the means.
