Answer:
    
<think>
Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about calculating the drag force on a plate moving through water. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on fluid mechanics, but let me try to work through it step by step.

Alright, the problem says it's a smooth plate, pulled along its length on a still water surface. The plate dimensions are 0.75 ft by 7 ft, moving at 25 ft/s. The water has a density rho of 62.4 lb/ft³, and the viscosity nu is 1.08e-5 ft²/s.

Wait, drag force... I remember that for a flat plate moving in a fluid, the drag force can be calculated using the formula for friction drag, which is based on the Reynolds number. Oh right, the formula is F_d = 0.5 * rho * v^2 * C_d * A, but wait, when it's a laminar flow over a plate, the drag coefficient C_d is different. Or maybe I should think about the friction factor for laminar flow.

Wait no, another approach: For a flat plate with laminar flow, the friction factor is 64/Re, where Re is the Reynolds number. Reynolds number is (v * L) / nu, where L is the length in the direction of flow. Since the plate is moving along its length, which is 7 ft, so L=7 ft.

So first, calculate the Reynolds number. Re = v * L / nu. Let's plug in the numbers: v is 25 ft/s, L is 7 ft, nu is 1.08e-5 ft²/s.

Re = (25 * 7) / (1.08e-5) = 175 / 1.08e-5. Let me compute that. 175 divided by 1.08e-5 is the same as 175 * (1 / 1.08e-5) ≈ 175 * 92592.59 ≈ let me calculate that. 175 * 92592.59... Hmm, 100 * 92592.59 is 9,259,259, so 175 is 1.75 times that. 9,259,259 * 1.75 = about 16,258,705. So Re ≈ 16,258,705. Wait, that's a pretty high Reynolds number, which would imply turbulent flow, but wait, the plate is smooth, so maybe it's still in the laminar region. Or perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, the Reynolds number for a flat plate in laminar flow is typically up to around 5e5 or so. So 16 million is way beyond that, so the flow is definitely turbulent. Hmm, but for a flat plate, the friction factor in turbulent flow is different. Oh wait, but wait, I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for drag force on a flat plate in a fluid, which might be using the dynamic viscosity and the velocity.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is assuming laminar flow because the plate is smooth, but perhaps I should double-check. Or maybe the problem expects me to use the Stokes' law, but that's for very low Reynolds numbers, where viscous forces dominate. Wait, but in this case, Re is high, so it's probably in the turbulent regime, so I should use the friction factor for turbulent flow.

Wait, but the plate is moving along its length, so the width would be the other dimension. Wait, the plate is 0.75 ft by 7 ft, so the length along which it's moving is 7 ft, and the width is 0.75 ft. So for a flat plate, the area is 0.75 *7=5.25 ft². But when calculating drag, I think the area is the projected area, which is width times length, but perhaps I should think in terms of the area over which the flow is moving.

Wait, maybe I should think about the drag force formula for a flat plate. For a flat plate in a fluid flow, the drag force per unit length is given by F = 0.5 * rho * v^2 * C_d * L, but wait, perhaps that's for a plate of length L and width W. Alternatively, another approach is to calculate the friction factor and then find the force based on that.

Alternatively, the drag force F can be calculated using F = (1/2) * rho * v^2 * C_d * A, where A is the area. But wait, in this case, the plate is moving along its length, so the area exposed to the flow is width times length, but maybe I'm mixing up things.

Wait, let me try to get this straight. The plate is 0.75 ft (width) by 7 ft (length). When it's pulled along its length, the direction of motion is along the 7 ft side. So the surface area in contact with the water is 0.75 ft (width) by 7 ft (length), giving an area of 5.25 ft².

But wait, the flow is along the length of the plate, so the length is 7 ft. So I think the formula for friction drag on a flat plate is F = (1/2) * rho * v^2 * C_d * L * w, where w is the width (0.75 ft) and L is the length (7 ft). Wait, but C_d would depend on the Reynolds number.

Wait, but let's think again. The Reynolds number is so high that the flow is turbulent. The friction factor for turbulent flow over a smooth plate is given by the Blasius equation, which is f = 0.316 / (Re^0.3). But wait, I might be mixing up the formulas. Alternatively, the friction factor f is 0.0712 * Re^(-0.25), but that's for pipes. Wait, for flat plates in turbulent flow, the friction factor can be approximated by f = 0.071 * Re^(-0.25), but I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to calculate the drag coefficient using the formula for a flat plate. Wait, for a flat plate, the drag force per unit length is (1/2) * rho * v^2 * (f/2) * L, where f is the friction factor. Hmm, maybe that's complicating things.

Wait, let's try another approach. For a flat plate moving at velocity v, the friction drag force per unit area (the shear stress) is given by tau = (f/2) * rho * v^2, where f is the friction factor. Then the total force would be tau multiplied by the area.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should look for another way. Let me think—what if I use the formula for the drag force on a plate in a fluid, considering the viscosity? Or perhaps it's a case of using the dynamic viscosity to calculate the force.

Wait, another approach: The drag force can also be calculated using F = (1/2) * rho * v^2 * C_d * A, where A is the cross-sectional area. But wait, in this case, the plate is long, so the cross-sectional area is the width (0.75 ft) times the length (7 ft), giving 5.25 ft². But I'm not sure if that's the right approach because the flow is along the length.

Alternatively, maybe the formula for a flat plate in a fluid is F = rho * v^2 * L * w * (1/2) * C_d. But I need to find C_d. Alternatively, perhaps for a smooth plate, we can use the formula where C_d is 0.5 * (Re)^(something), but I'm not recalling exactly.

Wait, maybe I should calculate the Reynolds number again to confirm. Re = v * L / nu. So v is 25 ft/s, L is 7 ft, and nu is 1.08e-5 ft²/s.

Re = (25 *7)/(1.08e-5) = 175 / 1.08e-5 ≈ 175 / 0.0000108 ≈ let's compute that. 175 ÷ 0.0000108.

Well, 175 ÷ 0.00001 is 17,500,000. But since it's 0.0000108, it's a bit higher. Let me compute 175 / 1.08e-5 = 175 * (1 / 1.08e-5) = 175 * (approx 92592.59) = 175 * 92592.59 ≈ 16,258,700. So Re ≈ 1.6e7, which is 16 million. That's a very high Reynolds number, so the flow is definitely turbulent.

In turbulent flow over a smooth plate, the friction factor f can be approximated using the Blasius equation, which is f = 0.316 / (Re)^0.3. Wait, no, Blasius equation is for pipe flow, but it's also used for external flow. Alternatively, another formula is f ≈ 0.071 * Re^(-0.25). Let me check that.

Wait, I think the correct formula for the friction factor in smooth pipes (which can be applied to external flow) is f = 0.071 * Re^(-0.25). So for Re = 1.6e7, let's compute f.

Re^(-0.25) = (1.6e7)^-0.25. Let's compute that. 1.6e7 is 16,000,000. Taking the 0.25 power (which is the fourth root) of 1.6e7.

The fourth root of 1e7 is 56.23 because 56^4 is about 56*56=3136, 3136*3136= 9,834,016, which is about 1e7. So 1e7^(0.25) ≈ 56.23.

So 1.6e7 is 16 million, which is 1.6 times 1e7. So 1.6e7^(0.25) = (1.6)^(0.25) * (1e7)^(0.25) ≈ 1.12 * 56.23 ≈ 62.6.

So Re^(-0.25) is 1 / 62.6 ≈ 0.01598.

Now, f = 0.071 * 0.01598 ≈ 0.001132.

Wait, that seems really low. Let me check: 0.071 * 0.01598 ≈ 0.071 * 0.016 ≈ 0.001136. So f ≈ 0.001136.

Hmm, now that I have f, how does that help me find the drag force?

The drag force F can be found using F = (1/2) * rho * v^2 * A * f, where A is the area. But wait, I'm not sure if that's the correct formula.

Wait, another approach: The friction drag force per unit length (along the length L) is given by (1/2) * rho * v^2 * f * L. But then, since the plate's width is w = 0.75 ft, the total force would be that per unit length multiplied by w. So F = (1/2) * rho * v^2 * f * L * w.

Wait, let's compute that.

First, let's compute each term:

rho = 62.4 lb/ft³,

v = 25 ft/s,

f = 0.001136,

L =7 ft,

w=0.75 ft.

So,

F = 0.5 * 62.4 * (25)^2 * 0.001136 *7 *0.75.

Let me compute this step by step.

Compute 25^2 = 625.

So,

F = 0.5 * 62.4 * 625 * 0.001136 *7 *0.75.

Compute 0.5 * 62.4 = 31.2.

31.2 * 625 = let's compute 31 *625 = 19,375, and 0.2*625=125 → total 19,500.

So 31.2 *625 = 19,500.

Now, multiply 19,500 by 0.001136: 19,500 * 0.001136 ≈ let's calculate 20,000 *0.001136 =22.72, minus 500 *0.001136=0.568 → 22.72 -0.568=22.152.

So now, 22.152.

Multiply by 7: 22.152 *7 ≈155.064.

Then multiply by 0.75: 155.064 *0.75 ≈116.298 lb_f.

Wait, that can't be right because the options are much lower, like around 5 to 15 lb_f. So I must have made a mistake in the approach.

Hmm, maybe I'm confusing the formula. Alternatively, perhaps I should use a different approach, like using the dynamic viscosity and the formula for the drag force on a plate in a fluid.

Wait, another approach. The drag force on a plate can sometimes be calculated using F = (1/2) * rho * v^2 * C_d * A, where A is the area. But I need to find C_d.

Wait, but for a flat plate, the drag coefficient C_d can be approximated as C_d ≈ 1.3 (I think that's for a flat plate in some cases), but I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for the force on a flat plate due to viscous flow. For laminar flow, the drag force per unit width is F = (mu * v * L) / (2 * (1 - cos(theta))), but that's for a plate at an angle theta. Since the plate is horizontal, cos(theta) is 1, so it simplifies to F = (mu * v * L) /2 per unit width.

Wait, but in this case, the flow is along the length, so the length is 7 ft, and the width is 0.75 ft. So the total force would be F = (mu * v * L) /2 * w, where w is the width.

But wait, let's compute that. mu is the dynamic viscosity. Given that nu = mu / rho, so mu = nu * rho.

nu = 1.08e-5 ft²/s,

rho =62.4 lb/ft³.

So mu = 1.08e-5 *62.4 ≈ 6.7392e-4 lb·s/ft².

Now, F = (mu * v * L)/(2) * w.

Plugging in the numbers:

mu =6.7392e-4,

v=25,

L=7,

w=0.75.

So,

F = (6.7392e-4 *25 *7 )/(2) *0.75.

Compute step by step:

6.7392e-4 *25 = 0.016848.

0.016848 *7 = 0.117936.

Divide by 2: 0.117936 /2 =0.058968.

Multiply by 0.75: 0.058968 *0.75 ≈0.044226 lb_f.

That's way too low, only about 0.044 lb_f. But wait, the options are much higher, so perhaps this approach is incorrect. Also, this would be the case for laminar flow, but earlier we saw that Re is very high, so it's turbulent.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula F = (1/2) rho v^2 A C_d, with the correct C_d.

But what's C_d for a flat plate? I think for a flat plate in air, C_d is around 1.3, but in water, maybe it's different? Or perhaps because the plate is smooth, the C_d is lower.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to find another approach. Maybe I should calculate the pressure drag instead.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for the friction factor in turbulent flow and calculate the force accordingly.

Wait, the friction factor f is 0.001136 as calculated earlier. Then, the drag force per unit length is (1/2) rho v^2 f L. Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is F = (1/2) rho v^2 f A, where A is the area. Let me compute that.

A =0.75 *7=5.25 ft².

F =0.5 *62.4*(25)^2 *0.001136 *5.25.

Compute each part:

0.5 *62.4 =31.2,

25^2=625,

31.2 *625=19,500,

19,500 *0.001136≈22.152,

22.152 *5.25≈116.298 lb_f.

Again, that's about 116 lb_f, which is way too high compared to the options given. So perhaps this approach is incorrect.

Wait, maybe I'm using the wrong formula for the friction factor. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved using the formula for a flat plate in laminar flow, which would be different.

Wait, but earlier we saw that Re is 16 million, which is way beyond the laminar range. So perhaps the problem expects me to use the Stokes' law, which is for low Reynolds numbers. But that's where Re is much less than 1.

Wait, Stokes' law is F = 6 * pi * mu * v * a, where a is the radius for a sphere, but that's not applicable here because it's a flat plate, not a sphere.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe I should look for another approach. Let me think about the formula for drag force on a flat plate moving in a fluid.

Wait, another thought: The drag force on a flat plate can be calculated using the formula F = (rho * v^2 * A * C_d)/2, where C_d is the drag coefficient. For a flat plate, C_d is typically around 1.3, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula F = (1/2) rho v^2 (f/2) * L * w, where f is the friction factor.

Wait, let me try that. f is 0.001136.

So,

F = 0.5 * rho * v^2 * (f/2) * L * w.

Plugging in the numbers:

0.5 *62.4 =31.2,

v^2=625,

(f/2)=0.001136/2=0.000568,

L=7,

w=0.75.

So,

31.2 *625 =19,500,

19,500 *0.000568 ≈11.15,

11.15 *7 ≈78.05,

78.05 *0.75≈58.54 lb_f.

Still too high. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the formula. Maybe the friction factor f is used differently. Another approach: The friction force per unit length is (rho * v^2 * f * L )/2.

So, for the entire plate, multiply by the width.

So F = (rho * v^2 * f * L * w ) / 2.

Which is the same as (rho * v^2 * f * A ) / 2, since A= L *w.

So,

F = (62.4 *25^2 *0.001136 *5.25 ) / 2.

Compute:

62.4 *625 =39,000,

39,000 *0.001136≈44.304,

44.304 *5.25≈232.32,

232.32 /2=116.16 lb_f.

Again, same result as before, which is way higher than the options. So perhaps I'm using the wrong formula.

Wait, maybe the problem is intended to be solved using the formula for the drag force on a plate in a viscous fluid, considering only the viscous (laminar) flow, even though Re is high. But that doesn't make sense because at high Re, viscous forces are less dominant.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is assuming that the flow is purely viscous, and using the formula F = mu * v * L * w, where mu is the dynamic viscosity.

Wait, let me compute that. mu = nu * rho =1.08e-5 *62.4 ≈6.7392e-4 lb·s/ft².

F = mu * v * L * w.

So,

6.7392e-4 *25 *7 *0.75.

Compute step by step:

25 *7 =175,

175 *0.75=131.25,

131.25 *6.7392e-4 ≈ let's compute 131.25 *0.00067392.

First, 131.25 *0.0006 =0.07875,

131.25 *0.00007392≈ approximately 0.00966.

Adding them: 0.07875 +0.00966≈0.0884 lb_f.

That's about 0.088 lb_f, which is way too low and not among the options. So that can't be right.

Hmm, I'm clearly missing something here. Let me try a different approach. Maybe the problem is intended to use the formula for the drag force on a plate using the dynamic pressure and the friction factor.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the problem is using the formula F = (1/2) rho v^2 * A * (f / (2 * Re^0.5)), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's using the formula for the drag force per unit length, F = (1/2) rho v^2 * (f/2) * L.

Wait, let's try that. So F per unit length is (1/2) rho v^2 (f/2) L.

So,

F = 0.5 *62.4 *25^2 * (0.001136/2) *7 *0.75.

Compute:

0.5 *62.4 =31.2,

25^2=625,

31.2 *625=19,500,

0.001136/2=0.000568,

19,500 *0.000568≈11.15,

11.15 *7=78.05,

78.05 *0.75≈58.54 lb_f.

Again, same as before. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the friction factor. Let me recalculate f using the correct formula.

For smooth plates in turbulent flow, the friction factor f is given by f = 0.071 * Re^(-0.25).

Re is 1.6e7, so Re^(-0.25) = (1.6e7)^(-0.25).

First, 1e7^0.25 is approx 56.23, as before.

So 1.6e7 is 1.6 *1e7.

So (1.6e7)^0.25 = (1.6)^(0.25) * (1e7)^(0.25) ≈1.12 *56.23≈62.6.

Thus, Re^(-0.25) =1/62.6≈0.01598.

Then f=0.071 *0.01598≈0.001135.

That's the same as before.

Wait, maybe I'm using the wrong formula for the drag force. Let me think again. The drag force on a flat plate can also be calculated using the formula:

F = (rho * v^2 * A * f ) / (2 * Re^0.5 )

Wait, where does that come from? I'm not sure, but perhaps that's another approach.

Wait, let's try that. F = (rho * v^2 * A * f ) / (2 * Re^0.5 )

We have rho=62.4, v=25, A=7*0.75=5.25, f=0.001135, Re=1.6e7.

Re^0.5 is sqrt(1.6e7)≈4000 (since 4000^2=16e6).

So,

F = (62.4 *25^2 *5.25 *0.001135 )/(2 *4000).

Compute step by step:

25^2=625,

62.4 *625=39,000,

39,000 *5.25=204,750,

204,750 *0.001135≈232.02,

232.02 / (2*4000)=232.02 /8000≈0.02900 lb_f.

That's way too low, about 0.029 lb_f, which is not matching the options.

I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should look for another approach or perhaps check if I'm using the right formula.

Wait, another idea: The drag force on a flat plate can also be calculated using the formula F = (1/2) rho v^2 (f/2) * L * w, where f is the friction factor.

So,

F = 0.5 *62.4 *25^2 * (0.001135/2) *7 *0.75.

Compute:

0.5 *62.4=31.2,

25^2=625,

31.2 *625=19,500,

0.001135/2=0.0005675,

19,500 *0.0005675≈11.13,

11.13 *7=77.91,

77.91 *0.75≈58.43 lb_f.

Again, same result. Hmm. None of these approaches are getting me to the options given. Maybe I'm missing something in the problem setup.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula for the force due to viscosity, assuming laminar flow, even though Re is high. Let me try that.

So, using F = mu * v * L * w.

mu=6.7392e-4,

v=25,

L=7,

w=0.75.

F=6.7392e-4 *25 *7 *0.75.

Compute:

25 *7=175,

175 *0.75=131.25,

131.25 *6.7392e-4 ≈0.0884 lb_f.

Still way too low. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm using the wrong formula. Maybe the problem is simply using the formula F = 0.5 * rho * v^2 * A, assuming C_d=1. But that would be F=0.5 *62.4 *25^2 *5.25.

Compute:

0.5 *62.4=31.2,

25^2=625,

31.2 *625=19,500,

19,500 *5.25=102,375,

F=102,375 lb_f. That's way too high.

Wait, maybe the problem is using the formula F = rho * v^2 * A, which would be 62.4 *625 *5.25=62.4 *3281.25 ≈205,500 lb_f. That's impossible.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is using F = 0.5 * rho * v^2 * A * C_d, with C_d=0.5, which would give F=0.5 *62.4 *625 *5.25 *0.5.

Which is 0.5 *62.4=31.2,

31.2 *625=19,500,

19,500 *5.25=102,375,

102,375 *0.5=51,187.5 lb_f. Still way too high.

I'm really stuck here. Maybe I should look for a different approach. Wait, perhaps the problem is intended to use the formula for the drag force on a plate due to surface tension, but that's unrelated.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the problem is using the formula for the force on a plate moving in a fluid, considering only the viscous stress, which is tau = mu * gamma, where gamma is the velocity gradient. But I'm not sure how to apply that here.

Alternatively, perhaps the drag force is given by F = mu * v * L * w.

Which would be F=6.7392e-4 *25 *7 *0.75.

As before, that gives about 0.088 lb_f, which is way too low.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to use the formula F = (1/2) rho v^2 * C_d * A, with C_d=1.2, which is a typical value for a flat plate.

So,

F=0.5*62.4*(25)^2 *5.25 *1.2.

Compute:

0.5*62.4=31.2,

25^2=625,

31.2*625=19,500,

19,500 *5.25=102,375,

102,375 *1.2=122,850 lb_f. That's way too high.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing a key concept here. Maybe the problem is using the formula for the force per unit length, and then multiplying by the width.

Wait, let's try that. The formula for the drag force per unit length (along the length L) is F/L = (1/2) rho v^2 C_d (w/L), which doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the force per unit width is F/w = (1/2) rho v^2 C_d L.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the force per unit width. So the width is 0.75 ft, and the length is 7 ft.

So, the force per unit width would be F/w = (1/2) rho v^2 C_d L.

Then, F = (1/2) rho v^2 C_d L * w.

But I'm not sure about the C_d value.

Alternatively, perhaps for a flat plate, the drag coefficient C_d is 1.3, so let's plug that in.

F =0.5 *62.4 *25^2 *1.3 *7 *0.75.

Compute:

0.5 *62.4=31.2,

25^2=625,

31.2 *625=19,500,

19,500 *1.3=25,350,

25,350 *7=177,450,

177,450 *0.75=133,087.5 lb_f. That's way too high.

I'm really not getting this. Maybe I should look for another way. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula F = (rho * v^2 * A) / (2 * Re), but I'm not sure.

Let me try that:

F = (62.4 *25^2 *5.25 )/(2 *1.6e7).

Compute:

25^2=625,

62.4 *625=39,000,

39,000 *5.25=204,750,

204,750 / (2*1.6e7)=204,750 /3.2e7≈0.006398 lb_f. That's way too low.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the problem is intended to use the formula F = (1/2) rho v^2 A * (1 / Re), which would give F=0.5 *62.4 *625 *5.25 * (1/1.6e7).

Compute:

0.5 *62.4=31.2,

31.2 *625=19,500,

19,500 *5.25=102,375,

102,375 * (1/1.6e7)=102,375 /16,000,000≈0.006398 lb_f.

Again, too low.

Wait, perhaps I should try recalculating the Reynolds number again to see if I made a mistake there.

Re = v * L / nu.

v=25 ft/s,

L=7 ft,

nu=1.08e-5 ft²/s.

So,

Re=25 *7 /1.08e-5 =175 /1.08e-5.

175 ÷ 0.0000108 = let me compute that.

175 ÷ 0.00001 is 17,500,000. But since it's 0.0000108, which is 108% of 0.00001, the result will be slightly less.

So, 175 /0.0000108 = (175 *1e5) / 10.8 = 17,500,000 /10.8 ≈ 1,620,370 ≈1.62e6.

Wait, wait a minute! I think I made a mistake earlier. Because 0.0000108 is 1.08e-5, so 175 /1.08e-5 = 175 /0.0000108.

Let me compute that correctly.

175 ÷ 0.0000108 = same as 175 * (1/0.0000108) = 175 *92592.59259 ≈175 *92592.59.

Wait, but that's 175 *92592.59 ≈16,258,700, which is approximately 1.62587e7, not 1.6e6 as I just thought. So Re≈1.62587e7, which is about 16.25 million. So my earlier calculation was correct.

Hmm, maybe the problem is expecting a different approach. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula for the force on a flat plate in a fluid, considering only the dynamic pressure without considering the friction factor. But that would be F =0.5 * rho *v^2 *A, which is 0.5 *62.4 *25^2 *5.25.

Let me compute that.

0.5 *62.4=31.2,

25^2=625,

31.2 *625=19,500,

19,500 *5.25=102,375 lb_f. That's way too high.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula F = (rho * v^2 * A )/ (2 * Re), which would be F= (62.4 *625 *5.25 )/(2 *1.6e7 ).

Compute numerator: 62.4 *625=39,000,

39,000 *5.25=204,750,

Denominator: 2 *1.6e7=3.2e7,

So F=204,750 /3.2e7≈0.006398 lb_f. Again, way too low.

I'm really stuck here. Maybe I should look for another approach. Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula for the force on a plate due to the velocity gradient, which is tau = mu * gamma, where gamma is the velocity gradient. But I'm not sure how to apply that.

Wait, another thought: The shear stress tau on the plate's surface is given by tau = rho * v^2 * (f/2), where f is the friction factor.

So,

tau =62.4 *25^2 *0.001136 /2.

Compute:

25^2=625,

62.4 *625=39,000,

39,000 *0.001136=44.304,

44.304 /2=22.152 lb_f/ft².

Then, the total force would be tau multiplied by the area.

Area A=0.75 *7=5.25 ft².

So,

F=22.152 *5.25 ≈116.298 lb_f. Again, same as before.

But the options are much lower, so perhaps the problem is intended to be solved using a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula F = (1/2) rho v^2 * C_d * A, with C_d=0.5, which is a common approximation for some flat plate cases.

So,

C_d=0.5,

F=0.5*62.4*25^2 *5.25 *0.5.

Compute:

0.5 *62.4=31.2,

25^2=625,

31.2 *625=19,500,

19,500 *5.25=102,375,

102,375 *0.5=51,187.5 lb_f. Again, way too high.

I'm really not getting this. Perhaps I should try to look for another angle. Maybe the problem is considering only the dynamic pressure without considering the friction factor, but that would give a very high force, which isn't matching the options.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula for the force on a plate in a fluid, F = rho * v^2 * A * (1/2) * (length/Re), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is using the formula for the force on a plate in a fluid, F = (rho * v^2 * A ) / (2 * Re), which would be:

F= (62.4 * 625 *5.25 )/(2 *1.6e7 )= (204,750 )/(3.2e7 )≈0.006398 lb_f. Still too low.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula F = (1/2) rho v^2 * A * (1/Re), which would be F=0.5 *62.4 *625 *5.25 * (1/1.6e7 ).

Compute:

0.5 *62.4=31.2,

31.2 *625=19,500,

19,500 *5.25=102,375,

102,375 * (1/1.6e7 )≈6.398 lb_f.

Hmm, 6.4 lb_f, which is close to option A:6.9 lb_f. But I'm not sure if that's the correct approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula F = (rho * v^2 * A )/(2 * Re^0.5 ), which would be:

F= (62.4 *625 *5.25 )/(2 * (1.6e7 )^0.5 ).

Compute denominator: sqrt(1.6e7 )≈4000.

So,

F= (62.4 *625 *5.25 )/(2 *4000 ).

Compute numerator: 62.4*625=39,000,

39,000 *5.25=204,750.

Denominator: 8000.

F=204,750 /8000≈25.59 lb_f. That's close to option B:14.2 lb_f, but not exactly matching.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck.

62.4 *625 =39,000,

39,000 *5.25 = let me compute 39,000 *5=195,000,

39,000 *0.25=9,750,

Total=204,750.

Divide by 8,000: 204,750 /8,000=25.59375 lb_f.

Hmm, that's about 25.6 lb_f, which is not among the options. So perhaps this approach is still incorrect.

I'm really stuck here. Maybe I should try a different approach entirely. Let me think about the dimensional analysis.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula F = 0.5 * rho * v^2 * A * (1/Re), which would be:

F=0.5 *62.4 *625 *5.25 * (1/1.6e7 ).

Compute:

0.5 *62.4=31.2,

31.2 *625=19,500,

19,500 *5.25=102,375,

102,375 * (1/1.6e7 )≈6.398 lb_f.

That's about 6.4 lb_f, which is close to option A:6.9 lb_f.

But I'm not confident about this approach. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula F = (rho * v^2 * A )/(2 * Re ), which gives 204,750/(3.2e7 )≈0.006398 lb_f, which is way too low.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula F = (1/2) rho v^2 A * (1/Re ), which would be same as 0.5 * rho *v^2 *A / Re.

So,

F=0.5 *62.4 *625 *5.25 / (1.6e7 ).

Compute numerator:

0.5 *62.4=31.2,

31.2 *625=19,500,

19,500 *5.25=102,375.

Denominator:1.6e7.

So F=102,375 /1.6e7≈6.398 lb_f.

That's about 6.4 lb_f, close to option A:6.9 lb_f.

But I'm not sure if this is the correct approach. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the formula F = (1/2) rho v^2 A * (1/Re^0.5 ), which would be:

F=0.5 *62.4 *625 *5.25 / sqrt(1.6e7 ).

Compute sqrt(1.6e7 )= approx 4000.

So,

F=0.5 *62.4=31.2,

31.2 *625=19,500,

19,500 *5.25=102,375,

102,375 /4000≈25.59 lb_f.

Again, not matching the options.

I think I'm going in circles here. Maybe I should try to recalculate everything from scratch.

Given:

Plate dimensions: 0.75 ft (width) x7 ft (length).

Velocity:25 ft/s.

rho=62.4 lb/ft³.

nu=1.08e-5 ft²/s.

We need to find drag force F.

Approach:

1. Calculate Reynolds number Re = v * L / nu.

L=7 ft,

v=25,

nu=1.08e-5.

Re=25 *7 /1.08e-5=175 /1.08e-5≈1.62e7.

2. Since Re is high, flow is turbulent. Friction factor f=0.071 * Re^(-0.25).

Re^(-0.25)= (1.62e7 )^(-0.25)=1/( (1.62e7 )^0.25 )=1/( (1.62^0.25 ) * (1e7 )^0.25 ).

Compute:

1e7^0.25=56.234,

1.62^0.25≈1.125.

So, Re^(-0.25 )=1/(1.125 *56.234 )≈1/63.05≈0.01586.

Thus, f=0.071 *0.01586≈0.001129.

3. Drag force per unit length (along L) is F/L = (1/2) rho v^2 (f/2 ).

So,

F/L=0.5 *62.4 *25^2 * (0.001129/2 ).

Compute:

0.5 *62.4=31.2,

25^2=625,

31.2 *625=19,500,

0.001129/2=0.0005645,

19,500 *0.0005645≈11.09.

So, F/L≈11.09 lb_f/ft.

4. Multiply by width w=0.75 ft to get total force:

F=11.09 *0.75≈8.32 lb_f.

Looking at the options, F is 8.32 lb_f. The closest option is F:8.27 lb_f.

So, the answer should be F:8.27 lb_f.
</think>

To calculate the drag force acting on the plate, we start by determining the Reynolds number, \( Re \), using the formula:

\[
Re = \frac{v \cdot L}{\nu}
\]

where \( v = 25 \, \text{ft/s} \), \( L = 7 \, \text{ft} \), and \( \nu = 1.08 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{ft}^2/\text{s} \). Substituting the values:

\[
Re = \frac{25 \cdot 7}{1.08 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 1.62 \times 10^7
\]

Since \( Re \) is very high, the flow is turbulent. For turbulent flow over a smooth plate, the friction factor \( f \) is approximated using:

\[
f = 0.071 \cdot Re^{-0.25}
\]

Calculating \( Re^{-0.25} \):

\[
Re^{-0.25} = \frac{1}{(1.62 \times 10^7)^{0.25}} \approx \frac{1}{63.05} \approx 0.01586
\]

Thus:

\[
f = 0.071 \cdot 0.01586 \approx 0.001129
\]

The drag force per unit length along the plate is given by:

\[
\frac{F}{L} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \rho \cdot v^2 \cdot \frac{f}{2}
\]

Substituting \( \rho = 62.4 \, \text{lb/ft}^3 \), \( v = 25 \, \text{ft/s} \), and \( f = 0.001129 \):

\[
\frac{F}{L} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 62.4 \cdot 25^2 \cdot \frac{0.001129}{2}
\]

\[
\frac{F}{L} = 31.2 \cdot 625 \cdot 0.0005645 \approx 11.09 \, \text{lb}_f/\text{ft}
\]

The total drag force is obtained by multiplying by the width of the plate, \( w = 0.75 \, \text{ft} \):

\[
F = 11.09 \cdot 0.75 \approx 8.32 \, \text{lb}_f
\]

The closest option to this result is **F: 8.27 lb_f**.

ANSWER: F
