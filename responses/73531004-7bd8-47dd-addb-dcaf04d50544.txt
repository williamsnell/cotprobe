Question:

A 30-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 2-day history of abdominal pain. She has a history of recurrent upper respiratory tract infections, sinusitis, and pancreatitis. She has thick nasal secretions. She says that her sweat is salty and crystallizes on her skin. Her vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows epigastric tenderness. Genetic testing for the 36 most common mutations shows a detectable mutation (G551D) in one allele of the CFTR gene. Which of the following best explains this patient's clinical phenotype?

Options:

A: Both CFTR alleles must be mutated to produce symptoms
B: Only one G551D allele is needed in CFTR
C: The patient is a CFTR obligate carrier
D: The patient's symptoms are coincidental and not related to the CFTR mutation
E: The G551D mutation in CFTR does not cause symptoms
F: The patient's CFTR mutation is unrelated to her clinical phenotype
G: The second CFTR mutation was not detected by the testing obtained
H: The patient's clinical phenotype is due to a mutation in a different gene
I: The patient has a rare form of CFTR mutation that requires two alleles
J: The CFTR mutation is associated with her clinical phenotype but not the cause

Okay, so I have this medical question to answer, and I'm trying to think through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The patient is a 30-year-old woman with a 2-day history of abdominal pain. Her medical history includes recurrent upper respiratory infections, sinusitis, and pancreatitis. She also mentions thick nasal secretions, salty sweat that crystallizes on her skin. Her vital signs are normal, and on exam, there's epigastric tenderness. Genetic testing showed a G551D mutation in one allele of the CFTR gene. So, the question is asking which option best explains her clinical phenotype.

Hmm, I remember that CFTR mutations are associated with cystic fibrosis (CF). But wait, CF is typically a recessive disorder, which means you need two copies of the defective gene to have the disease. But there are some exceptions, like in cases of incomplete dominance or semi-dominant mutations.

The G551D mutation is a specific type of CFTR mutation. I think I heard that some mutations are "semi-dominant" or "incomplete dominant," meaning that having just one copy can cause some symptoms. G551D is actually a well-known mutation that causes a gating defect in the CFTR protein. In some cases, it's associated with a milder form of CF, sometimes referred to as CF with a mutation that doesn't fully block function but impairs it.

Wait, but the patient has a history of upper respiratory issues, sinusitis, and pancreatitis. Those are classic CF symptoms. Also, the salty sweat is a hallmark of CF because the defective CFTR doesn't properly transport chloride, leading to thick mucus and high salt sweat.

But she only has one allele with the G551D mutation. Oh right, sometimes CFTR mutations can be heterozygous and present with symptoms. I think this is called being a carrier with a mutation that causes mild or partial CF. Or maybe it's a situation where a single mutation leads to some manifestations.

Looking at the options:

A: Both CFTR alleles must be mutated to produce symptoms. That would be the case for typical CF, which is recessive. But if the mutation is semi-dominant, this might not hold.

B: Only one G551D allele is needed. This makes sense if the mutation is dominant or semi-dominant.

C: The patient is a CFTR obligate carrier. Obligate carriers have one mutated allele and are usually asymptomatic, but maybe in this case, they're showing symptoms.

D: Symptoms are coincidental. Unlikely because the symptoms match CF.

E: G551D doesn't cause symptoms. But I know G551D is a disease-causing mutation, so this is incorrect.

F: Mutation unrelated to phenotype. No, the symptoms fit.

G: Second mutation not detected. So she might have another mutation on the other allele. If the testing only found one, maybe she has two mutations, but the testing didn't pick up the second. This could mean she has CF if the second is a CF-causing mutation. But the question says the testing found a detectable mutation in one allele. So perhaps the second isn't detected, but why? Maybe the test only checked the 36 most common mutations, so a rare one might be missed. So in that case, she could have two mutations, one common and one rare, leading to CF.

H: Mutation in a different gene. Unlikely because the symptoms point to CF, and the mutation is in CFTR.

I: Rare form needing two alleles. Not sure. Some rare mutations might require two copies, but G551D is common.

J: Mutation associated but not the cause. Unlikely, as the symptoms align with CF.

So, the options are B or G. If the testing only found one mutation, but the patient has symptoms, it's possible that the second mutation wasn't detected. For example, if the second allele has a different mutation that wasn't among the 36 tested, the test would miss it. So G could be the case.

Alternatively, if the G551D mutation itself is enough to cause symptoms, then B would be the answer. But I think that in most cases, CF requires two mutations because it's a recessive disease. However, G551D is a CF-causing mutation, but in some cases, being heterozygous can present with mild symptoms. There's something called "CFTR-related disorders" where people with one mutation can have some manifestations.

Wait, another point: the patient has a history of pancreatitis, which is a common CF complication. Also, thick nasal secretions and salty sweat. So her symptoms are consistent with CF. The genetic test shows only one mutation. So why does she have symptoms?

Possibly, she has a second mutation that wasn't detected. So option G is plausible. Because the genetic testing only checked the 36 most common mutations, perhaps the second mutation is a less common one, leading to her having two defective CFTR alleles, thus producing symptoms.

Alternatively, maybe the G551D mutation alone is enough to cause some mild symptoms, but I think that's less likely. Most CF cases require two mutations. However, in some cases, a single mutation can cause mild or partial CF, especially in certain tissues. For example, some people with one G551D allele might have CF-like symptoms but not the full-blown disease.

Wait, but the question says that the genetic testing found a detectable mutation in one allele. That suggests that the other allele is normal. So, if the patient only has one mutated allele, why does she have symptoms? That would go against the typical recessive model. Unless G551D is dominant, but I don't think it is.

Wait, I think there's a condition called "CFTR mutation-related diseases" where individuals with one mutation can have certain symptoms. For instance, some people with a single G551D mutation might develop CF-like symptoms, but it's less severe. Or perhaps it's a situation where the other allele is normal but there's another mutation elsewhere.

Alternatively, the question says that the patient has a history of recurrent upper respiratory infections, sinusitis, and pancreatitis. Those are common in CF, so if she only has one mutation, maybe she's a heterozygote with some mild symptoms. But I'm not sure if this is a recognized phenomenon.

Another angle: the G551D mutation is a common cause of CF, but sometimes it's associated with a milder phenotype when present as a single mutation. For example, some studies suggest that G551D carriers can have symptoms like sinusitis or infertility, but not the full CF. But I'm not certain about that.

Wait, looking back at the options, option B says "Only one G551D allele is needed in CFTR." So that would mean that having one allele is sufficient to cause symptoms. That would explain her clinical picture.

But then, what about option G? If the second mutation wasn't detected, perhaps she has a second mutation that wasn't tested for, which would mean she has two CFTR mutations. The test only checked the 36 most common, so if her second mutation is rare, it wouldn't show up, and she would have CF because she has two defective alleles.

So, the question is: does she have two mutations (one detected, one not) or just one?

The question states that the genetic testing found a detectable mutation in one allele. It doesn't say that the other allele is normal. So, it's possible that the other allele has another mutation that wasn't detected because the test only checked 36 common ones.

In that case, option G would be correct: the second mutation wasn't detected by the testing. So the patient has two CFTR mutations, one of which is G551D, and the other is perhaps a different mutation not included in the 36 tested.

Alternatively, maybe the patient only has the G551D mutation, and that's enough to cause her symptoms. But in typical CF, two mutations are needed. However, some mutations can cause a dominant effect, leading to symptoms with only one copy.

Wait, I think I remember that G551D is a CF-causing mutation, but it's a missense mutation that affects the CFTR function. In some cases, heterozygotes ( carriers) can have mild or specific symptoms. For example, some studies suggest that carriers might have a higher risk of certain complications like nasal polyps or sinusitis, which aligns with the patient's history.

So, if she has only one G551D allele, it might be sufficient to cause her symptoms, especially if the other allele is normal. So, option B would make sense: only one allele is needed. But I'm a bit confused because I thought CF is recessive.

Wait, no, some mutations are dominant-negative, meaning that one mutant allele can disrupt the function of the other normal allele. But I'm not sure if G551D is like that.

Alternatively, maybe the mutation affects a specific organ more than others. For example, the sweat chloride test is positive, which is due to the CFTR dysfunction in the sweat glands. So even with one allele, the sweat might be salty because the CFTR isn't working properly in those cells.

Wait, another thought: the CFTR gene is responsible for chloride transport. If one allele is mutated, the cells might still function somewhat normally, but if the mutation is severe enough, it could lead to dysfunction. But in most cases, two mutations are needed because the protein is misfolded or doesn't function, and you need both copies to be defective to have a significant impact.

So, perhaps the patient has another mutation that wasn't detected. That would mean the test only found one, but she has a second one. So option G would be correct.

But the question states that the testing found a detectable mutation in one allele. So, if the other allele is normal, why does she have symptoms? That's confusing.

Alternatively, maybe the G551D mutation is dominant, so only one copy is needed. That would explain her symptoms. So option B would be the answer.

I think I'm getting stuck between options B and G. The question is whether the mutation is sufficient on its own or if another mutation is present but not detected.

Given that the patient has a history of multiple CF-related symptoms, including pancreatitis and thick mucus, it's more likely that she has two CFTR mutations. But the testing only found one. Therefore, the best explanation is that the second mutation wasn't detected. So the answer would be G.

Wait, but the options are about explaining the clinical phenotype. If the second mutation wasn't detected, she could still have CF because she has two mutations, one known and one unknown. So G would explain why she has the symptoms despite only one detected mutation.

Alternatively, if the mutation is dominant, then B would explain it. But I think the standard CF is recessive.

Therefore, the correct answer is probably G: The second CFTR mutation was not detected by the testing obtained.
</think>

The patient is a 30-year-old woman with a history of symptoms consistent with cystic fibrosis (CF), including recurrent respiratory infections, sinusitis, pancreatitis, and salty sweat. Genetic testing revealed a G551D mutation in one allele of the CFTR gene. CF is typically a recessive disorder, requiring two defective alleles to produce the full phenotype. However, the G551D mutation is a well-known CF-causing mutation that can sometimes lead to symptoms even when present in a single allele, depending on its severity and the specific tissues affected.

The question asks which option best explains the patient's clinical phenotype. Option B suggests that only one G551D allele is needed, which could explain her symptoms if the mutation is dominant or semi-dominant. Option G posits that the second mutation was not detected by the testing, which only checked the 36 most common mutations. Given the patient's symptoms and the fact that CF is typically recessive, it is plausible that she has two CFTR mutations, one of which was not detected by the test.

While the G551D mutation alone might contribute to mild symptoms in some cases, the patient's history of severe complications like pancreatitis strongly suggests the presence of two CFTR mutations. Therefore, the most likely explanation is that the second mutation was not detected by the testing, aligning with option G.
