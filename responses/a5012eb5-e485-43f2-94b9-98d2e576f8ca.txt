Okay, so I need to find the value of b where the parabola y1 = x² + 2x +7 and the line y2 = 6x + b intersect at only one point. Hmm, I remember that when a line intersects a parabola at only one point, it's tangent to the parabola. That means the system of equations has exactly one solution. 

So, to find where they intersect, I can set y1 equal to y2 because they're equal at the point of intersection. That gives me the equation x² + 2x +7 = 6x + b. Let me rearrange this to form a quadratic equation. Subtract 6x and b from both sides: x² + 2x +7 -6x -b = 0. Simplify the like terms: x² -4x + (7 - b) = 0.

Now, since the line is tangent to the parabola, this quadratic equation should have exactly one real solution. That happens when the discriminant is zero. The discriminant of a quadratic equation ax² + bx + c = 0 is b² - 4ac. So, in this case, a is 1, the coefficient of x². The coefficient of x is -4, so b (in the discriminant formula) is -4. And the constant term is (7 - b), so c is (7 - b).

Plugging into the discriminant: (-4)² - 4*(1)*(7 - b) = 0. Let me compute that. (-4)^2 is 16. Then 4*1*(7 - b) is 4*(7 - b) which is 28 -4b. So the equation becomes 16 - (28 -4b) = 0. Wait, no, more accurately, it's 16 - 4*(7 - b) = 0. Let me make sure: discriminant D = (-4)^2 -4*1*(7 - b) = 16 - 4*(7 - b).

Simplify that: 16 -28 +4b = 0. Because 4*(7 -b) is 28 -4b, but since it's subtracted, it's -28 +4b. So 16 -28 is -12. So -12 +4b = 0. Now, solving for b: 4b = 12. Divide both sides by 4, so b = 3.

Wait, let me check that again. Maybe I made a mistake in the signs. Let me go through each step again. The quadratic equation is x² -4x + (7 - b) = 0. So a=1, b=-4, c=7 -b. The discriminant is (-4)^2 -4*1*(7 -b) = 16 -4*(7 -b). So 16 -28 +4b = 0. That's 16 -28 is -12, so -12 +4b =0. Adding 12 to both sides: 4b =12, so b=3. So the value of b is 3, which is option C.

The parabola and line intersect at one point when the quadratic equation formed by setting them equal has a discriminant of zero. Solving gives b = 3.

Answer: C
