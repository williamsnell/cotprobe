Okay, so I've got this economics question here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. The question is about the total product of labor rising at an increasing rate. I remember that in production theory, total product (TPL) is the total output produced by a certain amount of labor. The rate at which TPL is increasing is related to marginal product of labor (MPL), which is the additional output produced by one more unit of labor.

So, the question says that TPL is rising at an increasing rate. That means as we add more labor, not only does output increase, but the increase itself is getting larger. I think this has something to do with the law of diminishing marginal returns. Wait, no, actually, the law of diminishing marginal returns says that after a certain point, adding more labor leads to smaller increases in output. But that would mean MPL is decreasing, right?

Wait, but the question says TPL is rising at an increasing rate, which would imply that MPL is increasing. Because if each additional unit of labor is adding more to the total product than the previous one, then MPL is rising. So, when TPL is increasing at an increasing rate, MPL is positive and increasing. That would mean that the marginal product is going up as more labor is added. 

Looking at the options:

Option E says marginal product of labor is rising. That seems to fit because if TPL is increasing at an increasing rate, each additional labor unit contributes more, so MPL rises.

Option H says MPL is falling, which would be the opposite scenario, when TPL increases but at a decreasing rate. So H is not the case here.

Option I says MPL is at its maximum. I'm not sure about that. MPL reaches its maximum before the TPL starts to increase at a decreasing rate. So if TPL is increasing at an increasing rate, MPL hasn't yet reached its maximum; it's still rising.

Option D says average product is falling. Wait, average product (APL) is TPL divided by the number of labor units. If TPL is increasing at an increasing rate, then APL would also be increasing because each additional labor unit adds more than the previous, so the average is going up. So D is incorrect.

Option B says APL is at its maximum. Hmm, APL reaches its maximum when MPL equals APL. So if MPL is rising, APL is also rising, meaning B isn't correct yet.

Option A: MPL is at its minimum. That would be if MPL is just starting to increase, but in our case, MPL is rising, so A is not right.

Option C: Total cost decreasing. Well, if production is increasing and costs might be rising, but the question doesn't give any info on costs, so I don't think C is relevant here.

Option F: Marginal cost rising. Again, the question is about labor's product, not costs. So F is probably not related.

Option G: MPL is constant. No, because TPL is increasing at an increasing rate, so MPL can't be constant.

Option J: TPL is at its maximum. No, because if TPL is still rising, it hasn't reached maximum yet.

So the only option that fits is E: marginal product of labor is rising.

The correct answer is E: marginal product of labor is rising. When the total product of labor increases at an increasing rate, the marginal product of labor (MPL) is also rising because each additional unit of labor contributes more to the total output.

Answer: E
