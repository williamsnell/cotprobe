Question:

A plantiff sued a defendant for injuries suffered m a fall on the sidewalk of the defendant's home. The plaintiff's complaint alleged that the walk was covered by a thick sheet of ice, which had been negligently left there for several days by the defendant. In his answer, the defendant set forth that the ice formed overnight and that the plaintiff fell before the defendant had a chance to remove it. During the trial, a physician, whose office was next door to the defendant's home, testified that he saw the plaintiff fall and that the ice, which had been there for several days was at least two inches thick. On cross-examination, counsel for the defendant asked the physician the following question: "During your treatment of the plaintiff on the day in question, is it not true that he told you his fall resulted from a loss of equilibrium after he suffered from dizziness?"Upon objection by the plaintiff's attorney, the physician's testimony will be ruled

Options:

A: inadmissible, because it is hearsay evidence.
B: admissible, because the physician had personal knowledge of the plaintiff's injuries.
C: admissible, because it provides additional information about the plaintiff's condition.
D: admissible, because it sheds light on the plaintiff's physical condition at the time of the fall.
E: inadmissible, because the physician's testimony is not relevant to prove that the plaintiff's alleged injuries are false or exaggerated.
F: inadmissible, because the physician's testimony is biased.
G: inadmissible, because the defendant's counsel failed to lay a proper foundation.
H: inadmissible, because it contradicts the defendant's statement.
I: admissible, because it is reasonably pertinent to diagnosis or treatment.
J: admissible, because it helps to establish the timeline of events.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this evidence question. Let's break it down step by step.

The situation is a slip-and-fall case. The plaintiff is suing the defendant because they fell on the defendant's sidewalk covered in ice. The complaint says the ice was there for several days due to the defendant's negligence. The defendant's answer says the ice formed overnight and that they didn't have time to remove it before the plaintiff fell.

During the trial, a physician who's next door testified. He saw the plaintiff fall and said the ice was at least two inches thick and had been there for several days. So his testimony supports the plaintiff's claim about the ice.

Now, on cross-examination, the defendant's counsel asked the physician: "During your treatment of the plaintiff on the day in question, is it not true that he told you his fall resulted from a loss of equilibrium after he suffered from dizziness?" The plaintiff's attorney objected, and we need to decide if the testimony is admissible.

First, I need to recall hearsay rules. Hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. If the statement is made by the declarant (the plaintiff) and relates to diagnosis or treatment, it's admissible under the exception for statements made for medical diagnosis or treatment.

The question is whether the physician's testimony about what the plaintiff said is hearsay. The defense is trying to get in that the plaintiff's fall was due to dizziness and loss of equilibrium, possibly to show that the fall wasn't caused by the ice but by the plaintiff's own condition.

The physician's testimony about the plaintiff's statement would be hearsay unless it falls under an exception. The treatment exception (FRE 803(4)) allows statements made by the patient to the physician that are relevant to diagnosis or treatment. Here, the plaintiff's statement about the cause of the fall could be relevant to treatment because it's part of the medical history that helps the physician understand the injury.

But wait, the defense is using it to show that the plaintiff's fall wasn't caused by the ice but by his own dizziness. If the statement is offered for that purpose, then it's hearsay because it's being used to prove the truth of what the plaintiff said (that he fell because of dizziness, not the ice). However, if the statement is being offered to show the physician's basis for treatment, then it's not hearsay. But in this case, the defense is using it to challenge the cause of the fall, not just the treatment.

Alternatively, sometimes in cases, the opposing party can use a statement against the declarant if it's made by the declarant. So if the plaintiff said he fell because of dizziness, the defense can use that against him to show that the fall wasn't due to the ice. But under the hearsay rule, unless it's an exception, it's inadmissible.

Wait, but under the rule against hearsay, statements made by the party against whom the statement is offered can be admissible. So if the plaintiff is the declarant, and the defendant is offering it, it's non-hearsay because it's being used against the plaintiff, the declarant. So, the statement is admissible as an admission of a party-opponent.

So which is it? Is it hearsay or not? Let me think. The statement is being offered by the defense, and it's the plaintiff's own statement. So under FRE 801(d)(2), a statement is not hearsay if it's offered against an opposing party and was made by the party's agent or employee on a matter within their authority. Here, the plaintiff is the party, so his statement would be an admission and thus not hearsay.

Alternatively, even if it's hearsay, there's the exception for statements made for medical diagnosis or treatment. So the physician can testify about the plaintiff's statements if they were made during treatment and relate to the treatment or diagnosis.

But in this case, the defense is using the statement to show that the fall wasn't caused by the ice but by the plaintiff's own condition. So the statement is being offered for its truth, which would otherwise be hearsay, but because it's an admission by a party-opponent, it's not considered hearsay.

Wait, but the physician is testifying about what the plaintiff said during treatment. So the statement is both an admission and part of the treatment. So the defense can introduce it as an admission, which is non-hearsay, or under the medical treatment exception.

In this case, the objection is about hearsay. The defense is trying to get the statement in, but the plaintiff's attorney is objecting. The possible options are whether it's admissible or not.

Looking at the options:

A: inadmissible, because hearsay. But if it's an admission, it's not hearsay. So A might not be correct.

I: admissible, because it's reasonably pertinent to diagnosis or treatment. This seems correct because the statement was made during treatment and relates to the cause of the fall, which is relevant to treatment.

Alternatively, since the statement is being offered to show the cause of the fall, which is a fact at issue, the defense can use it as an admission.

But wait, the question is whether the testimony is admissible. The physician's testimony about the plaintiff's statement would be hearsay unless an exception applies.

If the statement is offered for its truth, it's hearsay unless it's an admission. Since the plaintiff is the declarant and the defendant is the opposing party, it's an admission and thus non-hearsay.

But wait, the defense's question is about the plaintiff's statement during treatment. So the statement is made by the plaintiff to the physician, which is for treatment. So the physician can testify to that statement under the medical treatment exception. Therefore, the testimony would be admissible.

Alternatively, the defense might be trying to use it to show that the plaintiff's version of events is inconsistent, which would go to the credibility of the plaintiff's claim.

But the initial objection is about hearsay. So whether the testimony is admissible because it's an exception or not hearsay.

I think the correct answer is I: admissible, because it is reasonably pertinent to diagnosis or treatment.

Wait, but another angle: the statement is about the cause of the fall, which is a fact at issue. If the physician is testifying about the plaintiff's statement about the cause, that's being offered for the truth, which is hearsay unless an exception applies.

But since it's an admission by a party-opponent (the plaintiff is the party, and the statement is being offered by the defense), it's non-hearsay under 801(d)(2)(A). So the testimony would be admissible as a party admission.

But the options don't include that reasoning. The options are about whether it's hearsay or not.

Looking back at the options:

Option I says it's admissible because it's reasonably pertinent to diagnosis or treatment. That's another way of saying it falls under the medical treatment exception.

So both reasoning paths lead to admissibility, either as a party admission or under the treatment exception.

But the question is, during cross-examination, the defense is asking the physician about the plaintiff's statement. The plaintiff's attorney objects on hearsay grounds. The court would need to decide if it's admissible.

If the court finds it's an admission, then it's not hearsay. If it's considered hearsay, then it's inadmissible unless an exception applies.

In this case, the statement is both an admission and part of the treatment. So it's admissible for both reasons.

Looking at the options, I think the best answer is I: admissible because it's reasonably pertinent to diagnosis or treatment.

Alternatively, option D says admissible because it sheds light on the plaintiff's physical condition at the time of the fall. That's also a possibility, but D is more about the condition, while I is about treatment.

Wait, but the statement is about the cause of the fall, which relates to treatment because the cause affects the treatment plan. So it's relevant to the treatment.

Therefore, the correct answer is I.

The testimony in question involves the physician recounting the plaintiff's statement about the cause of the fall. This statement is being offered to show that the fall resulted from dizziness and loss of equilibrium rather than the ice, challenging the plaintiff's claim. The key issue is whether this testimony is admissible despite the hearsay objection.

Under the Federal Rules of Evidence, hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. However, there are exceptions and exclusions. Here, the statement qualifies as a party admission under FRE 801(d)(2), as it is being offered by the opposing party (defendant) against the plaintiff, the declarant. Party admissions are not considered hearsay and are admissible.

Additionally, the statement could be admissible under the medical diagnosis or treatment exception (FRE 803(4)), as it was made during treatment and relates to the cause of the plaintiff's condition, which is relevant to treatment.

Given these considerations, the testimony is admissible because it is reasonably pertinent to the diagnosis or treatment of the plaintiff's condition.
