Answer the following multiple choice question, selecting from the answer A through to J. After thinking, reply directly with your answer. 

The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

Consider the following code segment, which uses the variables r, s, and t.
  r ← 1
   s ← 2
   t ← 3
   r ← s
   s ← t
   DISPLAY (r)
   DISPLAY (s)

 What is displayed as a result of running the code segment?

Options:

A: 3 3
B: 3 2
C: 2 1
D: 2 3
E: 1 2
F: 1 1
G: 2 2
H: 1 3
I: 3 1

Okay, I'm trying to figure out what this code segment does. Let me read through it step by step.

So, the code starts by assigning some values to variables r, s, and t. 

First line: r ← 1. So r is 1.
Second line: s ← 2. Now s is 2.
Third line: t ← 3. So t is 3.

Then, the next lines are assignments. 

Fourth line: r ← s. So whatever s is, r becomes that. Since s is currently 2, now r is 2.
Fifth line: s ← t. Now t is 3, so s becomes 3.

After these assignments, the code displays r and then s.

So after all the steps:
- r was 1, then became 2 when assigned from s.
- s was 2, then became 3 when assigned from t.

So when we display r, it's 2, and then display s, which is 3.

Wait, let me double-check. The initial values are r=1, s=2, t=3. Then r is set to s (so r=2), then s is set to t (so s=3). So when we display r, it shows 2, and s shows 3. So the outputs are 2 and 3.

Looking at the options, option D is 2 3. So the correct answer should be D.

The code assigns r to s (2), then s to t (3). Displaying r and s gives 2 and 3.

Answer: D
