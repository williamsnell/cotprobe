Okay, so I have this question about Epicurus, and I'm trying to figure out the answer. Let me think. I remember that Epicurus was an ancient Greek philosopher, and he had his own school of thought. I think he was a hedonist, but not the extreme kind. He believed in pursuing pleasure and avoiding pain, but in a more moderate way.

The question is asking what Epicurus claims all other virtues spring from. The options are A through J, with various virtues listed. Hmm, I need to recall what Epicurus emphasized as the foundation of all virtues.

I think Epicurus talked a lot about the cardinal virtues. Wait, no, wasn't that Aristotle? Or maybe it's different. Oh right, in Stoicism, the four cardinal virtues are wisdom, courage, justice, and self-discipline. But Epicurus was more of an atomist and had a different approach.

Wait, I remember that Epicurus considered friendship as the greatest good, but that's more about relationships. The question is about the source of all other virtues. So perhaps he thought that all virtues come from one primary virtue.

I think he might have emphasized prudence, which is often associated with practical wisdom or the ability to govern one's actions. Prudence is sometimes seen as the virtue that enables the practice of all other virtues. So if prudence is the key, then all other virtues stem from it.

Looking at the options, J is prudence. So the answer would be J. Alternatively, I might be mixing up with other philosophers. Let me double-check. Epicurus's philosophy is sometimes summarized as "a life of rational hedonism." He believed in moderation and avoiding unnecessary pain. So the virtues he valued would support that lifestyle.

I think in Epicurus's view, prudence (or practical wisdom) is what guides the other virtues. Without prudence, one might not make the right choices to lead a happy life. So yeah, the answer should be J: prudence.

The answer is J: prudence.

Epicurus, the ancient Greek philosopher, emphasized the importance of prudence as the foundation for all other virtues. He believed that prudence, or practical wisdom, guides individuals in making the right choices to lead a happy and contented life. This aligns with his teachings on rational hedonism and moderation, where prudence enables the practice of other virtues necessary for a flourishing life.

Answer: J
