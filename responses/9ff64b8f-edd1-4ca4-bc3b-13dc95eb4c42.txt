Okay, so I've got this optics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about a plane polarized light beam passing through a thin piece of quartz. The setup is that the optic axis lies on the surface, and we need to find the thickness of the crystal such that the phase difference between the E and O beams is π radians upon emergence.

Alright, first, let me recall some concepts. When plane polarized light passes through a crystal like quartz, which is a uniaxial crystal, it splits into two perpendicular components: the ordinary (O) and extraordinary (E) beams. Each of these beams travels at a different speed because they have different refractive indices. The refractive indices given are n_E = 1.553 and n_O = 1.544. 

The light is incident normally, which means it's hitting the crystal at a perpendicular angle. So, both the E and O beams will travel through the crystal with the same physical thickness, but their optical paths (which are n multiplied by the thickness) will be different. The difference in optical path will cause a phase difference between the two beams.

The phase difference Δφ is given by (2π/λ) * (n_E - n_O) * t, where t is the thickness of the crystal. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Actually, the phase difference should consider the difference in optical path lengths for E and O. So, the optical path length for E is n_E * t, and for O it's n_O * t. The difference is (n_E - n_O) * t. Then, the phase difference would be (2π/λ) multiplied by this difference.

But wait, λ here is the wavelength in vacuum or in the medium? Hmm, usually, when dealing with phase changes, the wavelength used is the wavelength in the medium. But wait, in this case, the light is initially in air (assuming the problem is about transmission through the crystal), so the incident wavelength is given as λ=6×10^-5 cm. Wait, 6e-5 cm is 6e-3 mm, which is 6000 Angstroms, so 600 nm. That's in the visible range, which makes sense.

Wait, but when the light enters the crystal, its wavelength changes. The wavelength λ' in the medium is λ_0 / n, where λ_0 is the vacuum wavelength. But wait, the problem gives λ as 6e-5 cm, but is that the wavelength in the medium or in vacuum? Hmm, the question says "λ = 6 × 10^-5 cm", but it doesn't specify. Wait, wait, in standard optics problems, when λ is given without a medium, it's usually the wavelength in vacuum. But sometimes, it's given as the wavelength in the medium. Wait, but in this case, since the light is incident on the crystal, I think it's safer to assume that λ is the vacuum wavelength. So λ_vacuum = 6e-5 cm = 6e-3 mm = 600 nm. Then, the wavelength inside the crystal for each beam would be λ_E = λ_vacuum / n_E and λ_O = λ_vacuum / n_O.

But wait, in the phase difference formula, the path difference is (n_E t - n_O t) = t (n_E - n_O). Then, the phase difference is (2π / λ) * (n_E t - n_O t), because the path difference is (n_E t - n_O t). Wait, but wait, the phase difference should be based on the number of wavelengths each beam travels. So, each beam's phase is (2π * path) / λ, where path is n t (since optical path is n * t). So the phase for E is (2π n_E t) / λ, and for O it's (2π n_O t) / λ. The difference is (2π t (n_E - n_O)) / λ.

But wait, the question states that the phase difference upon emergence is π radians. So, (2π t (n_E - n_O)) / λ = π. Simplifying this equation: 2π t (n_E - n_O) / λ = π → 2 t (n_E - n_O) = λ → t = λ / (2 (n_E - n_O)).

Wait, let me plug in the numbers. First, compute n_E - n_O. n_E is 1.553, n_O is 1.544, so the difference is 0.009.

The wavelength λ is given as 6 × 10^-5 cm. Let me convert that into meters or another unit to keep consistent units. Wait, 6e-5 cm is 6e-7 meters, but more accurately, 1 cm is 0.01 meters, so 6e-5 cm is 6e-7 meters. Alternatively, 6e-5 cm is 6e-3 mm, which is 0.006 mm, which is 6 micrometers. Wait, but 6e-5 cm is 6e-3 mm, yes. So 0.006 mm is 6 micrometers, which is 6000 Angstroms. Wait, but 6e-5 cm is 6 ×1e-2 m ×1e-3 cm = 6e-7 meters? Wait, perhaps better to convert everything into meters.

Wait, 1 cm is 0.01 meters, so 6 ×1e-5 cm is 6 ×1e-5 ×0.01 = 6e-7 meters. So λ = 6e-7 meters.

So t = λ / [2 (n_E - n_O)} ].

Plugging the numbers: λ=6e-7 m, n_E - n_O=0.009.

So t = (6e-7 m) / (2 * 0.009) = (6e-7) / 0.018 = (6 / 0.018) × 1e-7 m.

Calculating 6 / 0.018: 0.018 is 1.8e-2. 6 / 0.018 = (6 / 1.8) * 1e2 = (3.333...) * 100 ≈ 333.333... So 333.333e-7 m = 3.3333e-5 m. To convert that into mm: 1 m = 1000 mm, so 3.3333e-5 m = 3.3333e-2 mm = 0.033333 mm.

Looking at the options, option H is 0.033 mm, which matches this calculation.

Wait, but let me double-check the units. Let me convert λ to mm: 6e-5 cm is 6e-3 mm (since 1 cm = 10 mm, so 6e-5 cm = 6e-5 *10 mm = 6e-4 mm? Wait, wait, no, wait: 1 cm = 10 mm, so 1 mm is 0.1 cm. So 6e-5 cm is 6e-5 * 10 mm = 6e-4 mm. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 1 cm is 10 mm, so 1 mm is 0.1 cm. Therefore, 6e-5 cm is 6e-5 * (10 mm/cm) )= 6e-4 mm. So λ is 6e-4 mm.

Wait, but that's a big discrepancy from my earlier calculation. Wait, perhaps I messed up the unit conversion earlier. Let me redo the unit conversion carefully.

Given λ = 6 × 10^-5 cm. To convert cm to mm, since 1 cm = 0.1 mm, so 1 mm is 10 times larger than cm. So 6e-5 cm is 6e-5 * 0.1 mm = 6e-6 mm. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 1 cm = 10 mm, so 1 mm = 0.1 cm. So to convert cm to mm, multiply by 10. So 6e-5 cm = 6e-5 * 10 mm = 6e-4 mm. So λ=6e-4 mm.

Wait, that's correct. So λ=6e-4 mm.

So t = λ / [2*(n_E - n_O)] = (6e-4 mm) / [2*(0.009)].

Calculating denominator: 2 * 0.009 = 0.018.

So t = (6e-4) / 0.018 = (6 / 0.018) * 1e-4 mm.

6 / 0.018 = 333.333... So 333.333... * 1e-4 mm = 3.3333e-2 mm = 0.033333 mm.

So that's 0.033333 mm, which is approximately 0.033 mm. Looking at the options, option H is 0.033 mm. So that should be the correct answer.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up the formula. The phase difference is (2π/λ) * (n_E - n_O) * t = π. So solving for t gives t = λ/(2 (n_E - n_O)).

Yes, that's correct because (2π/λ)*Δn*t = π → Δn * t = λ/(2), so t = λ/(2 Δn).

Yes, that's right. So the calculation seems correct. So the answer should be option H: 0.033 mm.

To find the thickness \( t \) of the quartz crystal such that the phase difference between the E and O beams is \( \pi \) radians, we use the formula for phase difference:

\[
\Delta \phi = \frac{2 \pi}{\lambda} (n_E - n_O) t
\]

Given \( \Delta \phi = \pi \), we solve for \( t \):

\[
t = \frac{\lambda}{2 (n_E - n_O)}
\]

### Step 1: Convert the wavelength to mm
The wavelength is given as \( \lambda = 6 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{cm} \). Converting to mm:

\[
\lambda = 6 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{cm} \times 10 \, \text{mm/cm} = 6 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{mm}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate \( n_E - n_O \)
\[
n_E = 1.553, \quad n_O = 1.544 \quad \Rightarrow \quad n_E - n_O = 0.009
\]

### Step 3: Solve for \( t \)
Substitute the values into the formula:

\[
t = \frac{6 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{mm}}{2 \times 0.009} = \frac{6 \times 10^{-4}}{0.018} = 0.033333 \, \text{mm}
\]

### Step 4: Match with the options
The closest option to \( 0.033333 \, \text{mm} \) is \( 0.033 \, \text{mm} \), which corresponds to **Option H**.
