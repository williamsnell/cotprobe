Okay, so I have this question about structuralists and their focus matching a current psychological perspective. I'm a bit rusty on my psychology history, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that structuralism was one of the early schools of thought in psychology. The structuralists, like Wilhelm Wundt and Edward Titchener, were all about breaking down mental processes into their most basic components. They wanted to understand the structure of the mind, hence the name structuralism. They used introspection, which is like self-examination, to study experiences and sensations.

Now, looking at the options, I need to match structuralism with a current perspective. Let's go through each option:

A: Behaviorists – They focus on observable behavior and how it's learned through interaction with the environment. They don't really delve into internal mental structures, so probably not this one.

B: Psychoanalysts – This perspective, influenced by Freud, looks into the unconscious mind and how early experiences and the id, ego, superego influence behavior. It's more about the dynamic aspects rather than the structure of the mind itself.

C: Developmental psychologists – They study how people develop over their lifespan, focusing on areas like cognitive, emotional, and social growth. Not directly about the structure of the mind.

D: Neuropsychologists – They study the relationship between the brain and behavior, looking at how the nervous system affects psychological processes. This is more about the physical structure of the brain, not the mind's structure.

E: Humanists – Focus on the individual's potential and self-actualization, emphasizing personal growth and self-determination. Doesn't seem to align with structuralism's focus on breaking down structures.

F: Health psychologists – They look at how psychological factors influence health and illness. More about the interaction between mind and body, not the structure of the mind.

G: Cognitivists – This perspective studies mental processes like perception, memory, and problem-solving. It's about how the mind works, which seems closer to structuralism's interest in mental structures.

H: Forensic psychologists – They apply psychological principles to legal issues, like evaluating criminal behavior. Not related to internal structures.

I: Social psychologists – Focus on how social environments and group behaviors affect individuals. More about external influences rather than internal structures.

J: Existential psychologists – They deal with themes like meaning, freedom, and existence. More philosophical and less about structural components.

So, comparing structuralism's focus on the structure of mental processes with the options, cognitivists (G) are interested in the processes and structures of the mind, like how information is processed. Behaviorists (A) are more about external behaviors, not internal structures. Therefore, the closest match is probably G: cognitivists.

The focus of structuralists, who sought to break down mental processes into their basic components, aligns most closely with the current perspective of cognitivists. Cognitivists study mental processes like perception, memory, and problem-solving, which involves understanding the structure of the mind.

Answer: G
