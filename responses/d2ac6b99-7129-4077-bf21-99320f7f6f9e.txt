Okay, so I've got this question about a 3-way set-associative cache, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let me start by recalling what I know about cache memory and set-associativity.

First, I remember that cache memory is organized into blocks, and set-associative refers to how these blocks are mapped. In a set-associative cache, each set can hold multiple blocks. The number before "way" indicates how many blocks a set can hold. So a 3-way set-associative cache means each set can store three blocks.

Wait, but how does this relate to the main memory? Each main memory block is mapped to a specific set in the cache. So, each main memory word would have a certain number of possible locations in the cache, depending on how the sets are structured.

Looking at the options, let's go through them one by one.

Option A: Only effective when more than 3 processes are running. Hmm, I don't think the number of processes directly affects the set-associativity. The effectiveness is more about the cache's hit rate and how well it can handle memory accesses, not the number of processes. So I'm not sure about this one.

Option B: Possible only with write-through. Write-through is a policy where data is written directly to main memory whenever it's written to cache. But set-associativity is more about the mapping between main memory and cache, not the write policy. So I don't think B is correct.

Option C: Each main memory word can be stored at any of 4 cache locations. Wait, the question is about 3-way, so maybe 4 is incorrect. I think the number of ways would mean each word can go into any of those ways within a set. So maybe 3 locations? Not sure yet.

Option D: Possible only with write-back. Write-back is another policy where data is written to main memory only when a block is replaced. Again, this is about write policies, not the associativity. So D is likely incorrect.

Option E: Effective only with 3 or fewer processes. Similar to A, I don't see a direct link between the number of processes and set-associativity. So probably not E.

Option F: Each cache can store 3 main memory words. Wait, no. A 3-way set-associative cache has each set containing 3 blocks. But the entire cache can hold more than that, depending on the size. So F might be mixing up the per-set blocks with the total cache capacity.

Option G: Each main memory word can be stored at any of 3 cache locations. That sounds more accurate. Because in a 3-way set-associative cache, each memory block is mapped to a specific set (like a group), and within that set, it can be placed in any of the 3 blocks (ways) available in that set. So each word has 3 possible cache locations within its assigned set.

Wait, but how does the mapping work? In a k-way set-associative cache, each set has k blocks. So each memory address is mapped to a specific set, and then within that set, the block can be placed in any of the k ways. So for a 3-way, each main memory word can be in any of 3 cache blocks within its assigned set.

So looking back, option G says "each main memory word can be stored at any of 3 cache locations." That seems correct. So the answer should be G.

The correct answer is G: one in which each main memory word can be stored at any of 3 cache locations.

Answer: G
