Question:

This question refers to the following information.
The assumption by a government of the office of Reliever-general to the poor is necessarily forbidden by the principle that a government cannot rightly do anything more than protect. In demanding from a citizen contributions for the mitigation of distress … the state is … reversing its function. … To enforce the fundamental law—to take care that every man has freedom to do all that he wills, provided he infringes not the equal freedom of any other man. … [But that] is quite a separate thing from insuring him satisfaction. …
The poverty of the incapable, the distresses that come upon the imprudent, the starvation of the idle, and those shoulderings aside of the weak by the strong … are the decrees of a large, farseeing benevolence. … When regarded not separately, but in connection with the interests of universal humanity, these harsh fatalities are seen to be full of the highest beneficence.
Herbert Spencer, Social Statistics: Survival of the Fittest Applied to Humankind, 1851

Okay, so I have this question about Herbert Spencer's passage, and I need to figure out what he infers. Let me read the passage again carefully.

The passage starts by saying that the government's assumption of the office of Relievers-general to the poor is forbidden because the government can't do more than protect. It mentions that when the state demands contributions from citizens for mitigating distress, it's reversing its function. So, the government shouldn't be involved in helping the poor beyond protection.

Then it talks about enforcing the fundamental law, ensuring everyone has freedom as long as they don't infringe on others' equal freedom. It's clear that Spencer is emphasizing individual freedom and non-interference from the state. He says this is separate from insuring satisfaction, meaning the government isn't responsible for making people happy or providing for them.

Next, the passage discusses the poverty of the incapable, distress of the imprudent, starvation of the idle, and the weak being pushed aside by the strong. It refers to these as "decrees of a large, farseeing benevolence." So, Spencer seems to think that these harsh outcomes are actually beneficial in the grand scheme of things when viewed in the context of universal humanity. He implies that allowing the strong to succeed and the weak to struggle is part of a larger, beneficial plan.

Now, looking at the options:

A: Believed working people should unite for a common cause. I don't see any mention of unions or common causes here. The passage is more about the government's role, not about workers uniting.

B: Believed government should ensure satisfaction of its citizens. No, the passage says the opposite. The government shouldn't provide for satisfaction; it should just protect.

C: Supported government intervention in economic matters. Wait, the passage says the government shouldn't take on the role of relieving poverty, so this seems incorrect. Spencer is against the government getting involved beyond protection.

D: Advocated for higher taxes to support social causes. Again, the passage is against government intervention, so this doesn't fit.

E: Believed the government should do more than merely protect its people. No, the first line says the government can't do more than protect, so Spencer's view is that it shouldn't do more.

F: Believed in a society where the strong help the weak. Hmm, the passage says the opposite. It suggests that the weak being pushed aside is part of a larger plan, implying that the strong don't need to help the weak. So F doesn't seem right.

G: Opposed the use of tax money to provide aid to the poor. That fits because the passage says the government shouldn't demand contributions for mitigating distress, which would involve using tax money for aid. So G seems correct.

H: Advocated for a welfare state. No, because a welfare state involves government support, which Spencer is against.

So, putting it all together, Spencer is against the government using tax money to aid the poor. Therefore, the correct answer should be G.
</think>

The passage states that Herbert Spencer opposed the government's role in aiding the poor, arguing that the state should only protect and not provide for citizens' satisfaction. He believed that harsh outcomes like poverty and distress were part of a larger, beneficial plan, and thus the government should not intervene beyond protection. Therefore, Spencer opposed using tax money to provide aid to the poor.

Answer: G
