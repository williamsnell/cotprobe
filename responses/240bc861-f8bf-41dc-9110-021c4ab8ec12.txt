Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best way to decrease hostility between groups of junior high school students. Let's see, the question is asking what action would be most effective. There are several options to consider, from A to J.

First, I'll go through each option one by one to understand what they suggest.

Option A: Have the school counselor conduct individual sessions with each student. Hmm, individual sessions might help students with personal issues, but I'm not sure if that directly addresses the group dynamics. It might help some students individually, but it might not tackle the root cause of the hostility between groups.

Option B: Assign the students goals that can only be achieved through intergroup cooperation. This sounds interesting. If they have to work together to achieve something, maybe they'll learn to collaborate and see each other as allies rather than enemies. That could reduce hostility by building teamwork.

Option C: Have a respected community member speak about the benefits of cooperation. That could be effective because a respected figure might inspire them. But would a single talk be enough? It might raise awareness but not necessarily change behaviors unless followed up with actions.

Option D: Teach about the negative impacts of hostility through videos and presentations. Education is good, but sometimes just presenting information doesn't lead to behavior change. It might increase awareness but may not reduce the actual hostility between groups.

Option E: Have each group select a representative to discuss ways to reduce hostility. This could promote communication and mutual understanding. Representatives might find common ground and work towards solutions together, which could help reduce tension.

Option F: Implement a reward system for least hostile groups. Incentives can be motivating, but it might create a focus on avoiding penalties rather than fostering genuine cooperation. Also, it might pit groups against each other in a competitive way, which could backfire.

Option G: Organize competitive games between groups. Competitive games might increase tensions if one group wins, especially if there's a lot on the line. It could either foster camaraderie or escalate rivalry, depending on how it's handled. Not sure if this is the best approach.

Option H: Increase opportunities for contact under pleasant conditions. This rings a bell. I remember something about the contact hypothesis, which suggests that positive interactions between groups can reduce prejudice and hostility. If students have more positive interactions, they might learn to like each other better and reduce hostilities.

Option I: Encourage each group to develop their own rules. This might lead to each group having different standards, which could create more divisions rather than bringing them together. It might not address the underlying issues between groups.

Option J: Establish strict rules and penalties. While clear rules are important, this approach focuses on punishment rather than addressing the root causes. It might reduce overt hostility but could lead to undercurrents of resentment or avoidance.

Now, considering all options, the most effective approach seems to be either B, E, or H. Option H, increasing positive contact, aligns with the contact hypothesis, which is a well-researched method to reduce intergroup tensions. Assigning goals that require cooperation (B) is also good, as it forces interaction. However, sometimes just working together on a task might not be enough if the initial interactions are forced or if there's still underlying tension.

Option E, having representatives discuss, could help, but it's limited to discussions and might not lead to actual behavior changes unless they translate into actions together.

Comparing B and H, H is more about the interactions themselves, which can lead to more natural reductions in hostility as they get to know each other better. Assigning group goals (B) is also effective but might require more structure and could depend on how the groups perceive the goal.

I think H is the most comprehensive approach because it allows for organic, positive interactions, which can lead to more lasting changes in attitudes and behaviors between the groups.

The best approach to decrease hostility between groups of junior high school students is to increase opportunities for contact under pleasant conditions. This method aligns with the contact hypothesis, which emphasizes the importance of positive interactions in reducing intergroup tensions. By fostering natural and enjoyable interactions, students can develop mutual understanding and reduce hostility more effectively than other approaches.

Answer: H
