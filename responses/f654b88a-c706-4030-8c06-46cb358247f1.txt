Okay, so I have this question about plant growth, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is: "A plant that grows along a trellis exhibits..." and then there are several options. I remember that plant growth movements in response to stimuli are called tropisms. Tropisms can be positive or negative, depending on whether the plant grows towards or away from the stimulus.

First, I should think about what a trellis does. A trellis is a structure that plants like vines or climbers grow along. So the plant is growing upward and around the structure. This makes me think of how the plant's stems grow in contact with the trellis.

I recall that there are different types of tropisms. Let me list them out to see which applies here:

1. **Heliotropism**: Response to light direction, like flowers following the sun.
2. **Hydrotropism**: Response to water, roots growing towards water.
3. **Thigmotropism**: Response to touch or contact, like vines wrapping around a support.
4. **Gravitropism**: Response to gravity, roots growing downward.
5. **Chemotropism**: Response to chemicals, like roots growing towards nutrients.
6. **Phototropism**: Response to light, shoots growing towards light.

The plant is growing along the trellis, which suggests it's responding to physical contact. When a plant part touches a surface and then grows along it, that's thigmotropism. I think tendrils and vines exhibit this behavior. They curl around a trellis because they sense the contact and then grow in that direction.

Looking at the options, option C is thigmotropism. Let me double-check the other options to make sure I'm not confusing anything.

Option A: Heliotropism is about sun movement, which doesn't fit here. B: Hydrotropism is water, not relevant. D and G: Gravitropism is about gravity, not the trellis. E: Chemotropism is chemicals. F and H, I: Phototropism is light. None of these seem to fit the scenario of growing along a structure due to contact.

So the correct answer must be C: thigmotropism.

The plant's growth along a trellis is best explained by thigmotropism, which is the response to physical contact.

Answer: C
