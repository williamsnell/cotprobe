<think>
Okay, so I've got this problem here about radiation exposure, and I need to figure out how long it takes for someone to receive a certain dose from a gamma-ray source. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step. 

First, the problem states that the maximum weekly dose for the hands and forearms is 2.0 rem. The person's mass is 6 kg, and the surface area is 950 cm². The source is 15 millicuries, emits 3.0 MeV gamma rays, and is 15 cm away. I'm supposed to find out the time it takes to receive this dose, assuming no air absorption.

Wait, I remember that radiation exposure is related to the activity of the source, the distance from the source, and the time of exposure. The formula I think I need is the exposure dose formula. I think it's something like Dose = (Activity × Time) / (Distance² × Absorption factors), but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula.

Oh right, the basic formula for exposure (in rads or rems) is D = (N × t) / (4πd²), where N is the number of decays, t is time, and d is distance. But wait, Activity (A) is λN, where λ is the decay constant. So maybe I can express it in terms of Activity.

Wait, another approach: the exposure rate (C) is given by C = (A × t) / (4πd²), where A is the activity in curies, t is time in seconds, and d is in meters. Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again.

Ah, right, the exposure rate (in roentgens per hour, R/h) can be calculated using the formula: C = (A × T) / (4πd² × K), where A is in millicuries (mCi), d in cm, and K is a constant. Or maybe it's better to use the formula in terms of the exposure rate constant.

Wait, I think the exposure rate (in mR/h) can be calculated using the formula: C = (A × T) / (distance squared) × some factor. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me look up the formula in my notes.

Wait, no, I can't look it up, so I have to recall. The exposure due to a gamma source is given by the formula:

Dose (in rems) = (Activity × Time) / (Distance squared) × (some conversion factor)

But I think the correct formula is:

D = (A × t) / (4π * d²) × (1.25e-5) 

Wait, where A is in curies, t in seconds, d in meters, and D in rems. Or maybe I should use the exposure formula in terms of rads.

Alternatively, let me think about the units. 1 rem is 0.01 sieverts, but more importantly, the exposure in rems can be calculated using the formula:

Dose (rem) = (C × T) × (1.78e-5), where C is the exposure rate in roentgens per hour (R/h), and T is time in hours.

Wait, I think I need to find the exposure rate first. The exposure rate from a point source is given by:

C (R/h) = (A × 8.99e-6) / (d²), where A is in mCi and d in cm.

Wait, let me check the formula again. The exposure rate in R/h is given by:

C = (A × 8.99e-6) / (d²), where A is in mCi, d in cm.

So if A is 15 mCi, and d is 15 cm, then:

C = (15 × 8.99e-6) / (15²) 

Calculating that:

15 * 8.99e-6 = 134.85e-6 = 0.00013485

Then divide by 225 (since 15^2=225):

0.00013485 / 225 = approximately 5.98e-7 R/h.

Wait, that seems really low. Maybe I made a mistake in the formula. Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is:

C = (A × 8.99e-6) / d², where A is in mCi, d in cm.

Wait, 8.99e-6 is a conversion factor per mCi and cm. So yes, I think that's right.

So 15 mCi * 8.99e-6 = 15 * 8.99e-6 = 0.00013485 R/(cm²·h). Then divide by d squared (15 cm)^2=225 cm², so:

C = 0.00013485 / 225 ≈ 5.98e-7 R/h.

Wait, that's 5.98e-7 roentgens per hour. That's a very small number. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing a factor somewhere.

Wait, maybe the formula is C = (A × 8.99e-4) / d², where A is in mCi, d in cm, and C is in R/h. Let me check that. Because 1 mCi = 0.001 Ci, and 1 Ci = 3.7e10 Bq. Hmm, perhaps I should use the formula with the correct units.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

Exposure rate (C) in mR/h = (A in mCi) × (0.0178) / (d in cm)^2.

Wait, I think I remember that the exposure rate at 1 cm from 1 mCi of a gamma source is about 0.0178 mR/h. So more generally, C = (0.0178 * A) / d², where A is in mCi, d in cm, and C in mR/h.

So if A is 15 mCi and d is 15 cm, then:

C = (0.0178 * 15) / (15)^2 = (0.267) / 225 ≈ 0.0011867 mR/h.

Wait, that's 0.0011867 mR/h, which is 0.0011867 mR/h. To convert that into R/h, it's 0.0000011867 R/h. That seems way too low. I'm getting confused.

Wait, maybe I should use a different approach. Let me think about the units properly.

The exposure dose (D) in rems is equal to the product of the exposure rate (C in R/h) and the time (t in hours), so D = C * t.

I need to find t, so t = D / C.

But first, I need to calculate C correctly.

Another approach: The exposure dose from a gamma source can be calculated using the formula:

D = (A * t) / (4πd²) * (1.25e-5) 

Where:
- A is in mCi,
- t is in seconds,
- d is in meters,
- D is in rems.

Wait, let me check the units. 1 Ci = 3.7e10 Bq, and 1 Bq is 1 decay per second. The exposure formula in terms of air kerma is K = (activity * time) / (4πd²), and then converted into rems.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the exposure in rads first and then convert to rems. Because 1 rem = 1 rad (for gamma rays, since rem is rad equivalent man).

Wait, no, rem is a unit of dose equivalent, and rad is a unit of exposure. But for photons, the conversion factor is 1 rad = 1 rem, because the radiation weighting factor for photons is 1.

So, maybe I can calculate the exposure in rads and then it's the same as rems.

The formula for exposure (in rads) is:

E = (N * t) / (4πd²)

Where N is the number of photons emitted, t is time in seconds, and d is distance in meters.

But since the source is 15 mCi, which is 15e-3 Ci. Activity (A) = λN, so the number of decays per second is λN = A = 15e-3 Ci. Since 1 Ci = 3.7e10 decays/s, then A = 15e-3 * 3.7e10 = 5.55e8 decays per second.

Wait, but not all decays are gamma emissions. The source is 15 mCi of a gamma emitter. Let's assume it's a pure gamma emitter for simplicity, so each decay emits one gamma photon. So the number of photons emitted per second is equal to the activity, which is 5.55e8 photons/s.

So the exposure rate (in rads per second) would be:

E_rate = (A * t) / (4πd²)

Wait, no, E_rate is (A) / (4πd²) in rads per second. Because E = (A * t) / (4πd²).

So E_rate = A / (4πd²) in rads/s.

Given that, let's plug in the numbers.

A = 15 mCi = 15e-3 Ci = 15e-3 * 3.7e10 Bq = 5.55e8 decays/s.

d = 15 cm = 0.15 m.

So E_rate = (5.55e8) / (4 * π * (0.15)^2 )

Calculate denominator: 4 * π * 0.0225 = 4 * 3.1416 * 0.0225 ≈ 4 * 0.0706858 ≈ 0.282743.

So E_rate = 5.55e8 / 0.282743 ≈ 1.96e9 rads/s.

Wait, that can't be right. 1.96e9 rads per second is way too high. Because even 1 rad is a lot, and that's way beyond any practical exposure.

I must have messed up the units somewhere. Let me check again.

Wait, 1 Ci = 3.7e10 Bq, so 15 mCi = 0.015 Ci = 0.015 * 3.7e10 = 5.55e8 Bq. That's correct.

But when calculating E_rate, I think the formula is in terms of exposure in air, which has a density, so perhaps I should consider the exposure formula more carefully.

Another formula I remember is:

Exposure (E) in roentgens = (A * t) / (4πd²) * (1.25e-5) 

Where A is in mCi, t in seconds, d in meters, and E in roentgens.

Wait, 1 roentgen = 1 rad for X-rays or gamma rays. So the dose in rems would be the same as the exposure in roentgens.

So using this formula:

E (rem) = (A * t) / (4πd²) * 1.25e-5

Where A is in mCi, t in seconds, d in meters.

So, plugging in the numbers:

A = 15 mCi,
t = ? (we need to find t),
d = 0.15 m.

E = 2.0 rem (given).

So:

2.0 = (15 * t) / (4 * π * (0.15)^2 ) * 1.25e-5

Let me compute the denominator first:

4 * π * (0.15)^2 = 4 * 3.1416 * 0.0225 ≈ 4 * 0.0706858 ≈ 0.282743.

So,

2.0 = (15 * t) / 0.282743 * 1.25e-5.

Let me compute (15 / 0.282743) first.

15 / 0.282743 ≈ 53.05.

Then multiply by 1.25e-5:

53.05 * 1.25e-5 ≈ 6.631e-4.

So,

2.0 = (6.631e-4) * t.

Solving for t:

t = 2.0 / 6.631e-4 ≈ 3016.5 seconds.

Convert seconds to minutes: 3016.5 / 60 ≈ 50.275 minutes.

Wait, but looking at the options, the closest is H:50 min. But wait, another approach might give a different answer. Let me double-check.

Wait, perhaps I missed a conversion factor. Let me go through the steps again.

E (rem) = (A * t) / (4πd²) * 1.25e-5.

Yes, that's correct. Plugging the numbers again:

A=15 mCi,
t= t,
d=0.15 m.

So,

2.0 = (15 * t) / (4 * π * (0.15)^2 ) * 1.25e-5.

Compute denominator: 4π*(0.15)^2 = 4 * 3.1416 * 0.0225 ≈ 0.282743.

So,

2.0 = (15 * t) / 0.282743 * 1.25e-5.

Calculate 15 / 0.282743 ≈ 53.05.

Multiply by 1.25e-5: 53.05 * 1.25e-5 ≈ 6.631e-4.

So,

2.0 = 6.631e-4 * t → t ≈ 2.0 / 6.631e-4 ≈ 3016.5 seconds ≈ 50.275 minutes.

So the answer would be approximately 50 minutes, which is option H.

But wait, looking back at the options, option F is 22.6 min, J is 27.4, etc. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the formula. Let me check the formula again.

Wait, perhaps the formula should be E = (A * t) / (4πd²) * (exposure constant). Let me make sure the exposure constant is correctly applied.

I think the formula is:

Exposure (E) in roentgens = (A [mCi] * t [s] ) / (4πd² [m²]) ) × 1.25e-5.

Yes, that's correct. So my calculation seems right. So t is about 50.3 minutes, so option H:50 min.

Wait, but another thought: perhaps I should have used the exposure rate in mR/h and then multiplied by time in hours.

Let me try that approach.

Exposure rate (C) in mR/h is:

C = (A [mCi] * 0.0178) / d² [cm]^2.

So, A=15 mCi, d=15 cm.

C = (15 * 0.0178) / (15^2) = (0.267) / 225 ≈ 0.0011867 mR/h.

Wait, that's 0.0011867 mR/h, which is 1.1867e-3 mR/h.

Wait, but that seems too low. Because 1 mR/h is 0.001 R/h, so 1.1867e-3 mR/h is 1.1867e-6 R/h.

Wait, that can't be right because the exposure rate is way too low. I think I must have messed up the formula.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

C (mR/h) = (A [mCi] * 0.0178) / (d [cm])^2.

So, 0.0178 is the constant for mR/h when A is in mCi and d in cm.

So with A=15, d=15 cm,

C = (15 * 0.0178) / (15^2) = (0.267) / 225 ≈ 0.0011867 mR/h.

Again, that's 0.0011867 mR/h, which is 1.1867e-3 mR/h, or 1.1867e-6 R/h.

Wait, that's way too low. If that's the case, then to get 2.0 rem, which is 2000 mrem, the time would be enormous.

Wait, 2000 mrem / 0.0011867 mrem/h ≈ 1,684,000 hours, which is way too long. That can't be right.

So I must have made a mistake in the formula. Maybe the formula is actually C = (A * 8.99e-4) / d² in mR/h.

Wait, let me think differently. Maybe I should use the exposure formula in terms of dose per unit time.

The formula for dose rate (dose per second) is:

dose rate (rem/s) = (A [mCi] * 1e-3 Ci/mCi) * (3.7e10 decays/Ci) * (probability of photon emission) * (exposure constant) / (4πd²) [in meters squared]).

But this is getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula:

Dose (rem) = (A [mCi] * t [h] * 8.99e-6) / (d [cm])^2.

Wait, let me see: if I have A in mCi, t in hours, d in cm, then the formula would be:

D = (A * t * 8.99e-6) / (d²).

So plugging in the values:

D = 2.0 rem,
A=15 mCi,
d=15 cm,
t=?

So,

2.0 = (15 * t * 8.99e-6) / (15^2).

Simplify denominator: 225.

So,

2.0 = (15 * t * 8.99e-6) / 225.

Multiply both sides by 225:

450 = 15 * t * 8.99e-6.

Divide both sides by 15:

30 = t * 8.99e-6.

So,

t = 30 / 8.99e-6 ≈ 30 / 0.00000899 ≈ 3337306 seconds.

Wait, that's about 55,621 minutes, which is way too long. That can't be right either. I must have messed up the formula.

I'm getting conflicting results with different approaches. Let me try to find the correct formula.

Another way: The exposure dose (D) in rems is given by:

D = (A * t) / (4πd²) * (1.25e-5) 

Where:
- A is in mCi,
- t in seconds,
- d in meters,
- D in rems.

So, let's plug in the numbers.

A = 15 mCi,
t = t seconds,
d = 0.15 m.

So,

2.0 = (15 * t) / (4 * π * 0.15²) * 1.25e-5.

Compute denominator: 4 * π * 0.0225 ≈ 0.282743.

So,

2.0 = (15 * t) / 0.282743 * 1.25e-5.

Compute 15 / 0.282743 ≈ 53.05.

Multiply by 1.25e-5: 53.05 * 1.25e-5 ≈ 6.631e-4.

So,

2.0 = 6.631e-4 * t.

Solving for t:

t = 2.0 / 6.631e-4 ≈ 3016.5 seconds.

Convert seconds to minutes: 3016.5 / 60 ≈ 50.275 minutes.

So, about 50.3 minutes. Looking at the options, H is 50 min, which would be the closest.

Wait, but another thought: perhaps the formula uses time in hours. Let me double-check.

Wait, no, the formula I used has t in seconds. So 3016.5 seconds is indeed about 50.275 minutes.

So the answer should be H:50 min.
</think>

To determine how long it takes for a person to receive a maximum weekly dose of 2.0 rem from a 15 mCi gamma-ray source emitting 3.0 MeV photons at a distance of 15 cm, the exposure dose formula is used:

\[
D = \frac{A \cdot t}{4\pi d^2} \cdot 1.25 \times 10^{-5}
\]

Where:
- \( D \) is the dose in rems (2.0 rem),
- \( A \) is the activity in mCi (15 mCi),
- \( t \) is the time in seconds,
- \( d \) is the distance in meters (0.15 m).

Rearranging for \( t \):

\[
t = \frac{D \cdot 4\pi d^2}{A \cdot 1.25 \times 10^{-5}}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
t = \frac{2.0 \cdot 4\pi (0.15)^2}{15 \cdot 1.25 \times 10^{-5}}
\]

Calculating the denominator:

\[
4\pi (0.15)^2 = 4 \cdot 3.1416 \cdot 0.0225 \approx 0.282743
\]

\[
15 \cdot 1.25 \times 10^{-5} = 1.875 \times 10^{-4}
\]

\[
t = \frac{2.0 \cdot 0.282743}{1.875 \times 10^{-4}} \approx 3016.5 \, \text{seconds}
\]

Converting to minutes:

\[
t \approx \frac{3016.5}{60} \approx 50.275 \, \text{minutes}
\]

The closest option is **H: 50 min**.

Answer: H
