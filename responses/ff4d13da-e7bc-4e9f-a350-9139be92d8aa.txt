Okay, so I've got this logic problem to solve. Let me break it down step by step. The question is about constructing a truth table for a given argument and then determining whether it's valid or invalid. If it's invalid, I need to choose the correct counterexample from the options provided.

First, let's look at the argument given:

1. ~S ∨ T
2. ~S · U
3. ~T ∨ U

And the conclusion is T · U.

So, the premises are three statements, and the conclusion is another statement. The argument is valid if whenever all the premises are true, the conclusion is also true. If there's even one scenario where all premises are true but the conclusion is false, the argument is invalid, and that scenario is a counterexample.

To approach this, I need to construct a truth table with all possible truth values for the propositions S, T, and U. Since there are three variables, there are 2^3 = 8 possible combinations. I'll list them all out.

Let me list the variables as S, T, U, and for each, I'll compute the value of each premise and the conclusion.

Let's start by writing down all possible combinations:

1. S=T, T=T, U=T
2. S=T, T=T, U=F
3. S=T, T=F, U=T
4. S=T, T=F, U=F
5. S=F, T=T, U=T
6. S=F, T=T, U=F
7. S=F, T=F, U=T
8. S=F, T=F, U=F

Wait, actually, to avoid confusion, perhaps it's better to list all 8 combinations systematically. Let me correct that:

1. S=T, T=T, U=T
2. S=T, T=T, U=F
3. S=T, T=F, U=T
4. S=T, T=F, U=F
5. S=F, T=T, U=T
6. S=F, T=T, U=F
7. S=F, T=F, U=T
8. S=F, T=F, U=F

Wait, that's still 8, but maybe a better way is to list them in order of S, T, U:

1. T, T, T
2. T, T, F
3. T, F, T
4. T, F, F
5. F, T, T
6. F, T, F
7. F, F, T
8. F, F, F

Yes, that's correct. Now, for each of these 8 rows, I'll compute the premises and the conclusion.

Let's start with each row.

Row 1: S=T, T=T, U=T

Compute each premise:

1. ~S ∨ T: ~T is F, T is T → F ∨ T = T
2. ~S · U: ~T is F, U=T → F · T = F
3. ~T ∨ U: ~T is F, U=T → F ∨ T = T

Conclusion: T · U = T · T = T

So premises: T, F, T → but wait, the premises are all three statements. Wait, no, the premises are the three given, and the conclusion is the fourth.

Wait, actually, in an argument, the premises are the statements before the conclusion. So the premises are the three given, and the conclusion is T · U.

So for each row, I need to check if all three premises are true. If they are, then the conclusion must be true for the argument to be valid. If in any row, all premises are true but the conclusion is false, the argument is invalid.

So let's proceed.

Row 1: S=T, T=T, U=T

Premise 1: ~S ∨ T = F ∨ T = T
Premise 2: ~S · U = F · T = F
Premise 3: ~T ∨ U = F ∨ T = T

Conclusion: T · U = T · T = T

Now, since Premise 2 is F, the premises aren't all true. So this row doesn't affect the validity.

Row 2: S=T, T=T, U=F

Premise 1: ~S ∨ T = F ∨ T = T
Premise 2: ~S · U = F · F = F
Premise 3: ~T ∨ U = F ∨ F = F

Conclusion: T · U = T · F = F

Again, since Premise 2 is F, the premises aren't all true.

Row 3: S=T, T=F, U=T

Premise 1: ~S ∨ T = F ∨ F = F
Premise 2: ~S · U = F · T = F
Premise 3: ~T ∨ U = T ∨ T = T

Conclusion: T · U = F · T = F

Here, Premise 1 is F, so premises not all true.

Row 4: S=T, T=F, U=F

Premise 1: ~S ∨ T = F ∨ F = F
Premise 2: ~S · U = F · F = F
Premise 3: ~T ∨ U = T ∨ F = T

Conclusion: T · U = F · F = F

Again, Premise 1 and 2 are F.

Row 5: S=F, T=T, U=T

Premise 1: ~S ∨ T = T ∨ T = T
Premise 2: ~S · U = T · T = T
Premise 3: ~T ∨ U = F ∨ T = T

Conclusion: T · U = T · T = T

All premises are T, conclusion is T → no problem.

Row 6: S=F, T=T, U=F

Premise 1: ~S ∨ T = T ∨ T = T
Premise 2: ~S · U = T · F = F
Premise 3: ~T ∨ U = F ∨ F = F

Conclusion: T · U = T · F = F

Here, Premise 2 is F, so premises not all true.

Row 7: S=F, T=F, U=T

Premise 1: ~S ∨ T = T ∨ F = T
Premise 2: ~S · U = T · T = T
Premise 3: ~T ∨ U = T ∨ T = T

Conclusion: T · U = F · T = F

Wait, conclusion is F. But all premises are T. So this is a problem. Because if all premises are true, the conclusion should be true for the argument to be valid. Here, the conclusion is F, so this is a counterexample.

So in Row 7: S=F, T=F, U=T, all premises are true, but conclusion is F. So the argument is invalid.

Now, looking at the options, I need to find which option corresponds to this scenario.

Let me check the options:

A: Invalid. Counterexample when T is true, and S and U are false → T=T, S=F, U=F → This would be Row 8, which I'll check next.

B: Invalid. Counterexample when U is true and S and T are false → S=F, T=F, U=T → Which matches Row 7.

C: Valid

D: Valid. No counterexample exists.

E: Invalid. Counterexample when S and U are true and T is false → S=T, U=T, T=F → That's Row 3: S=T, T=F, U=T. Let me check that.

Row 3: S=T, T=F, U=T.

Premise 1: ~S ∨ T = F ∨ F = F → So premise 1 is F. So premises aren't all true. So E's counterexample isn't valid because in that case, premises aren't all true. So E is not a counterexample.

F: Invalid. Counterexample when S is true, T and U are false → S=T, T=F, U=F → Row 4. Let's check.

Row 4: S=T, T=F, U=F.

Premise 1: ~S ∨ T = F ∨ F = F → So premises not all true. So F's counterexample isn't valid.

G: Invalid. Counterexample when S, T, and U are true → S=T, T=T, U=T → Row 1. Let's check.

Row 1: S=T, T=T, U=T.

Premise 1: T, premise 2: F, premise 3: T. So premises not all true. So G's counterexample isn't valid.

H: Invalid. Counterexample when S is false, T is true, and U is false → S=F, T=T, U=F → Row 6.

Row 6: S=F, T=T, U=F.

Premise 1: T, premise 2: F, premise 3: F. So premises not all true. So H's counterexample isn't valid.

I: Invalid. Counterexample when S is true, T is false, and U is true → S=T, T=F, U=T → Row 3.

As I saw earlier, in Row 3, Premise 1 is F, so premises not all true. So I's counterexample isn't valid.

J: Invalid. Counterexample when S, T, and U are false → S=F, T=F, U=F → Row 8.

Row 8: S=F, T=F, U=F.

Premise 1: ~S ∨ T = T ∨ F = T
Premise 2: ~S · U = T · F = F
Premise 3: ~T ∨ U = T ∨ F = T

Conclusion: T · U = F · F = F

Here, Premise 2 is F, so premises not all true. So J's counterexample isn't valid.

So the only valid counterexample is when S=F, T=F, U=T, which is option B.
</think>

The argument is invalid because there is a counterexample where all premises are true, but the conclusion is false. This occurs when S is false, T is false, and U is true. 

Answer: B
