Question:

If a living frog muscle is dissected out from a frog's body and placed in a closed container without oxygen, it can contract for a time when stimulated. Then it stops. But if the container is opened, it soon regains the ability to contract. Comment.

Options:

A: The muscle cells contract due to the presence of carbon dioxide.
B: The muscle contracts because of the decrease in temperature when the container is opened.
C: The muscle cells are reanimated by the light entering the container when it is opened.
D: The muscle cells contract due to the release of lactic acid in the absence of oxygen.
E: The muscle cells require the presence of an inert gas, such as argon, to contract.
F: The muscle cells need nitrogen to contract.
G: The muscle cells contract due to the introduction of water.
H: The presence of oxygen enables the muscle cells to undergo aerobic respiration and produce more ATP, regaining its ability to contract.
I: Muscle contraction is restored due to increased humidity within the container.
J: The muscle cells contract because of the introduction of a new energy source when the container is opened.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about frog muscle contraction. Let me see. The question says that a living frog muscle is dissected and placed in a closed container without oxygen. It can contract for a time when stimulated, but then it stops. However, when the container is opened, it regains the ability to contract. I need to choose the correct comment from the options A to J.

First, I remember that muscle contraction requires energy, which is ATP. In the absence of oxygen, the muscle would rely on anaerobic respiration. Anaerobic respiration produces less ATP compared to aerobic respiration. So when the muscle is in a closed container without oxygen, it can still contract a few times because it has some stored ATP and can produce a little via anaerobic pathways. But over time, the ATP gets depleted, and the muscle can't contract anymore because it's not getting enough energy.

Now, when the container is opened, oxygen is reintroduced. With oxygen, the muscle cells can switch to aerobic respiration, which is more efficient and can produce more ATP. This allows the muscle to regain its ability to contract. So the presence of oxygen enables the cells to undergo aerobic respiration and produce more ATP.

Looking at the options, option H says exactly that: "The presence of oxygen enables the muscle cells to undergo aerobic respiration and produce more ATP, regaining its ability to contract." That makes sense.

Wait, let me double-check the other options to make sure. Option A talks about carbon dioxide, but I think CO2 is a byproduct, not the reason for contraction. Option B mentions temperature, but opening the container might not change temperature enough to affect this. Option C is about light; I don't think light is relevant here. Option D mentions lactic acid, which is a result of anaerobic respiration, but it doesn't explain why contraction resumes when oxygen is added. Option E is about inert gases; I don't see how that helps. Option F talks about nitrogen, which is in the air, but the key here is oxygen for respiration. Option G is about water, which isn't the issue since the container is closed but probably has moisture. Option I mentions humidity, which isn't the main factor. Option J talks about a new energy source, but oxygen allows for more efficient energy production, not a new source.

So the correct answer should be H.

The muscle can contract initially without oxygen due to anaerobic respiration, but it stops when ATP is depleted. Upon opening the container, oxygen reintroduces aerobic respiration, allowing more ATP production and restoring contraction. 

Answer: H
