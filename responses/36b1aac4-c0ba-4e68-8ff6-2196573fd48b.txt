Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about Anscombe's view on where the notion of moral obligation comes from. I'm a bit rusty on my philosophy, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that Anscombe was a 20th-century philosopher, and she wrote about ethics and the concept of obligation. I think she had some criticisms of certain ethical theories. Let me think about each option.

Option A: preference. Preference-based ethics would mean that moral obligations come from what we prefer. But I don't think Anscombe focused on preferences; she was more into actions and duties, maybe?

Option B: natural law. Natural law theory suggests that moral laws are derived from human nature or the universe's structure. Anscombe might have discussed this, but I'm not sure if she derived moral obligation from it. I think she was more critical of some aspects of natural law.

Option C: self-interest. Self-interest would tie into egoism, where obligations are for one's own benefit. Anscombe didn't seem to align with that; she was more about duties and obligations as separate from self-interest.

Option D: maximizing utility. That's Utilitarianism, right? Anscombe was critical of Utilitarianism, especially in her article "Modern Moral Philosophy." She didn't think that maximizing utility was the basis for moral obligation.

Option E: ethical relativism. This is the idea that moral obligations are relative to culture or society. I don't think Anscombe supported relativism; she was more of a deontologist, focusing on duties.

Option F: personal desire. That would mean obligations come from what one desires. Again, Anscombe's work seems more about external duties rather than personal desires.

Option G: positive law. Positive law is human-made law, like legislation. I don't recall Anscombe linking moral obligation to legal systems directly.

Option H: divine law. Divine law would suggest that moral obligations come from a divine source. Anscombe's work touches on religion, but I'm not sure if she directly tied moral obligation to divine law. She might have discussed it in some contexts, but I'm not certain.

Option I: societal norms. This would mean that society's norms define moral obligations. Anscombe was critical of this approach, as she emphasized individual duties over societal definitions.

Option J: consequentialism. Consequentialism is about the consequences of actions, like Utilitarianism. She was critical of this as well, as she focused more on the rightness or wrongness of actions themselves rather than their outcomes.

Wait, I think I might be mixing up some philosophers. Let me recall: Anscombe argued against the idea that moral obligation comes from maximizing utility or self-interest. She instead emphasized duties and rules. Oh, right, she was influenced by Kant, who talked about duties and obligations as part of the moral law. But Anscombe also discussed the concept of "obligation" in terms of what we have reasons to do, which might relate to duties or rules, not necessarily any of the listed options.

Wait, looking back at the options, I don't see an option that directly mentions duties or rules. So maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. Anscombe's article "Modern Moral Philosophy" criticized the idea that moral obligation comes from maximizing utility (which she saw as a form of consequentialism) or from natural law. She instead suggested that the concept of moral obligation is derived from the concept of the "moral law," which is more like duties or rules, but that's not one of the options.

Wait, looking at the options, option B is natural law, which she was critical of, and option H is divine law. Maybe she saw it as deriving from a higher law, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps she thought it's more about what is right or wrong in itself, regardless of consequences or self-interest.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck. Another approach: I remember that Anscombe was critical of the idea that moral obligation arises from human preferences (which would be option A), as she thought that obligation is a rational response to certain facts, not just preferences.

Alternatively, maybe she saw moral obligation as tied to societal norms or duties, but I don't see an option that directly matches that. The options given don't include "duties" or "rules," so I have to choose from the given list.

Wait, perhaps the answer is B: natural law. Because she was discussing how some derive moral obligation from natural law, but she was critical of that approach. Or maybe it's H: divine law. But I'm not certain.

Wait, I think I'm conflating different philosophers. Let me try to remember: Anscombe's target in "Modern Moral Philosophy" was the Utilitarian and Natural Law traditions. She argued that the concept of moral obligation is better understood in terms of the "moral law," which is more like the idea of duties. But the question is, which concept does she say it's derived from.

Alternatively, perhaps she thought that the notion of moral obligation comes from the concept of what is right or wrong in itself, irrespective of consequences or self-interest. But that's not one of the options.

Wait, another angle: the question is asking which concept the notion of moral obligation is derived from. So, perhaps she argues that moral obligation is derived from the concept of what is right (deontological), but if we have to choose from the options, maybe it's B: natural law, as she was responding to those who thought that way.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to think of what each option represents. Natural law (B) is the idea that moral laws are derived from human nature. Self-interest (C) is egoism. Utility (D) is Utilitarianism. Relativism (E) is cultural norms. Personal desire (F) is about what one wants. Positive law (G) is legal systems. Divine law (H) is religious-based laws. Societal norms (I) is similar to relativism. Consequentialism (J) is about outcomes.

I think Anscombe's point was that the concept of moral obligation is better understood as something like the moral law, which isn't captured by these options. But among the options, perhaps she was critical of deriving it from natural law or utility. So, perhaps the answer is B: natural law, but I'm not sure.

Wait, I think I'm getting this wrong. Another approach: in Anscombe's view, the notion of moral obligation is derived from the concept of what is the right thing to do, which is a deontological perspective. But since that's not an option, perhaps the closest is natural law, but I'm not confident.

Alternatively, maybe she thought that the notion of moral obligation is derived from the concept of the will of God (divine law), but that's speculative.

Wait, I think I remember that Anscombe was more of an intuitionist, thinking that moral truths are known through intuition, but that's not one of the options either.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck. Let me try to think of what each option is about. The question is which concept does Anscombe say moral obligation is derived from.

Wait, perhaps the answer is B: natural law. Because she was responding to those who thought that moral obligation arises from natural law, and she argued against that approach, suggesting instead that it's about the moral law. So maybe the correct answer is B, but I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps she thought that moral obligation is derived from the concept of what is good, but that's not an option.

Wait, another thought: Anscombe's article criticized the idea that moral obligation comes from maximizing utility (D), which is a form of consequentialism. She instead argued that the concept of moral obligation is better understood as involving the idea of what we have reason to do, which is more deontological. So, if the question is about where it's derived from, perhaps she thought it's not from utility, so the answer would be different.

Alternatively, maybe she thought it's derived from the concept of duty, but that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps the answer is B: natural law. Because she was critical of natural law theories, but the question is about where the notion is derived from. Maybe she said it's derived from natural law, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is H: divine law. Because she was influenced by Aquinas, who connected natural law with divine law, but I'm not certain.

I think I might have to make an educated guess here. Since Anscombe was critical of both natural law and Utilitarianism, perhaps she thought that the notion of moral obligation is derived from something else, but among the options, I'm not sure.

Wait, I think I'm overcomplicating. Let me look up Anscombe's view quickly in my mind. She argued that the concept of moral obligation is better understood as part of a system of duties, which are not derived from natural law, utility, or self-interest. So, perhaps the answer is B: natural law, but I'm not confident.

Alternatively, maybe she thought it's derived from the concept of what is right, but that's not an option. So, perhaps the answer is B: natural law.

Wait, no, I think I'm getting this wrong. Another approach: the question is about where Anscombe claims the notion comes from. She might have said it's derived from the concept of law, but in a moral sense. So, perhaps it's B: natural law, as that's a form of moral law.

Alternatively, perhaps she saw it as derived from divine law, but I'm not sure.

Hmm. I'm still not certain. I think the answer is B: natural law, but I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, maybe it's H: divine law. But I'm not sure.

Wait, I think I remember that Anscombe was critical of natural law theory, arguing that it conflates different kinds of laws. So perhaps she didn't think moral obligation is derived from natural law. That would leave the answer as something else.

If natural law is out, then maybe it's B is incorrect. So, what else? Maybe she thought it's derived from the concept of duties, but that's not an option. Alternatively, perhaps it's derived from the concept of what is right, but again, not an option.

Wait, perhaps the answer is none of these, but that's not an option. So, maybe the correct answer is B: natural law, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm mixing up Anscombe with other philosophers. Maybe the answer is B: natural law.

Wait, I think I've read that Anscombe was critical of natural law theorists, but she might have thought that the concept of moral obligation is part of a system of duties, which could be seen as a form of natural law. So, perhaps the answer is B.

Alternatively, maybe it's H: divine law, but I'm not sure.

I think I'll have to go with B: natural law as the answer, but I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps it's H: divine law.

Wait, another thought: Anscombe wrote about the concept of "obligation" in terms of what we are required to do, which is part of the moral law. She was critical of those who tried to ground this in natural law or utility. So, perhaps she didn't derive it from any of these options, but the closest might be B: natural law.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is B: natural law.

Wait, I think I'm stuck. I'll have to make a guess. I think the answer is B: natural law.

Anscombe's critique of moral theories, particularly in her work "Modern Moral Philosophy," highlights her skepticism toward deriving moral obligation from concepts like self-interest, utility, or societal norms. She emphasizes duties and the "moral law," though this isn't explicitly listed. Among the options, natural law (B) aligns most closely with her discussions, as she critiques its grounding of moral obligation. Thus, the answer is:

B
