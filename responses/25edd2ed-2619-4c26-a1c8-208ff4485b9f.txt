Question:

A deficiency in which endocrine gland would result in tetany?

Options:

A: Pancreas

C: pituitary gland
D: adrenal gland
E: thyroid gland
F: parathyroid gland
G: Pineal gland
H: Hypothalamus
I: Testis
J: Ovary

Answer:

Okay, so I've got this question about endocrine glands and tetany. Hmm, I remember that tetany has something to do with muscles, maybe cramps or spasms. I think it's related to calcium because calcium affects muscle function. Right, when calcium levels are low, muscles can get spasmy and cause tetany.

Now, the question is asking which gland deficiency causes this. Let's look at the options. The options are A through J, each an endocrine gland. I'm trying to remember which gland is responsible for calcium regulation.

I recall that the parathyroid glands secrete parathyroid hormone (PTH), which helps regulate calcium levels in the blood. If the parathyroid glands aren't working properly, PTH levels drop, leading to low calcium (hypocalcemia), which can cause tetany. So, if there's a deficiency in the parathyroid gland, that would be the cause.

Wait, but what about the other options? The pancreas is more about insulin and blood sugar. Thymus is related to the immune system. Pituitary gland controls other hormones, but I don't think it's directly involved in calcium. Adrenal glands are for stress hormones like cortisol. Thyroid gland affects metabolism and uses iodine, but it's not directly about calcium. Pineal gland is involved in sleep, I think. Hypothalamus is the brain region that links the nervous and endocrine systems. Testis and ovaries produce sex hormones. So, none of these others are directly linked to calcium levels.

So, the correct answer should be F: parathyroid gland.

The correct answer is F: parathyroid gland, as it regulates calcium levels, and a deficiency leads to hypocalcemia, causing tetany.

F: parathyroid gland
