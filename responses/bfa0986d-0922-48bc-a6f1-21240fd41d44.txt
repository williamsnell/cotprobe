Okay, so I have this question about group theory, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The set of integers Z is given with a binary operation "*" defined as a * b = a + b + 1 for any a, b in Z. The question is asking for the identity element of this group. The options are from A to J, with various numbers.

First, I remember that in group theory, an identity element is an element e such that for any element a in the group, the operation a * e equals a. So, for this specific operation, I need to find an integer e where a * e = a.

Let me write that out. According to the operation, a * e = a + e + 1. We want this to equal a. So:

a + e + 1 = a

Hmm, if I subtract a from both sides, that cancels out the a terms:

e + 1 = 0

So, solving for e, I subtract 1 from both sides:

e = -1

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, wait: if e + 1 = 0, then e is -1. So the identity element should be -1.

Let me double-check to make sure I haven't made a mistake. Let's substitute e = -1 into the operation. For any a in Z, a * (-1) should equal a.

So a * (-1) = a + (-1) + 1 = a -1 + 1 = a. Yes, that works.

But let me also check if the operation is actually a group. The question says it is, but just to be thorough, I should verify the group axioms to make sure I'm not missing anything.

Groups require four things: closure, associativity, identity, and inverses.

Closure: Since we're adding integers and adding 1, which are all integers, closure holds because the sum of two integers is an integer, and adding 1 keeps it an integer.

Associativity: Let's see if (a * b) * c = a * (b * c). Let's compute both.

Compute (a * b) * c: First, a * b = a + b + 1. Then, (a*b)*c = (a + b + 1) + c + 1 = a + b + c + 2.

Now compute a * (b * c): b * c = b + c + 1. Then, a * (b*c) = a + (b + c + 1) + 1 = a + b + c + 2. So both sides are equal. Hence, the operation is associative.

Identity: As we found, e = -1 works because a * (-1) = a.

Inverses: For each a in Z, there must exist an element b in Z such that a * b = e. We found e = -1, so we need a * b = -1.

Which means a + b + 1 = -1. Solving for b: b = -1 - a -1 = -a -2. Wait, that's an integer, so for each a, b = -a -2 is in Z. So inverses exist.

So yes, this is indeed a group under the operation *, and the identity element is -1, which is option A.

Wait, the options are A: -1, which matches my calculation. So I think the answer is A.

The identity element e satisfies a * e = a. Substituting the operation, a + e + 1 = a, leading to e = -1. Verified against the operation and group axioms, the identity is -1.

Answer: A
