The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

Traditional approaches seek to explain why and how states have sought security. Which answer best describes the approach of traditional Security Studies?

Options:

A: Traditional theories explain international politics as the distribution of power among members of an international system, and specifically as the balance of power amongst major states. The relative power and the constraints of a state are reflective of the security strategy of that state.
B: The traditional approaches emerged in response to the Cold War, and to the accumulation of tension and competition between the two Superpowers. Traditional theories seek to explain behaviour in terms of arms accumulation.
C: Traditional conceptions emerged to explain the clusters of norms and patterns of behaviour that result in management of conflict and cooperation in the international system, in specific spheres of activities.
D: Traditional approaches are concerned with sovereignty. Sovereignty is a legal status; it gives the state control over a specified territory, means it is free from arbitrary intervention, and is responsible to no higher authority. Traditional theories examine the patterns of behaviour and relative cooperation of sovereign states in the international system.

Okay, so I've got this question about traditional approaches in Security Studies. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

The question is asking which option best describes the approach of traditional Security Studies. The options are A through D. Let me think about what I know about traditional Security Studies.

From what I remember, traditional Security Studies, often called Realism, focuses on the state as the primary actor in international relations. It's all about power dynamics and how states seek security. Realism emphasizes the balance of power and the anarchic nature of the international system. States are self-interested and seek to maximize their power to ensure their survival.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Talks about the distribution of power and balance of power among major states. It mentions how a state's power and constraints relate to its security strategy. That sounds a lot like Realism because it's focusing on power distribution and state behavior based on that.

Option B: Says traditional approaches emerged during the Cold War and explain behavior through arms accumulation. While the Cold War did influence Realism, I think Realism existed before that. Plus, arms accumulation is a part of it, but the broader approach is more about power and state behavior, not just military aspects.

Option C: Discusses clusters of norms and patterns leading to conflict management and cooperation. This sounds more like Constructivism, which looks at norms and social structures. Traditional Security Studies, being Realist, isn't as focused on norms but rather on power and state interests.

Option D: Focuses on sovereignty, the legal status of states, and their behavior in the international system. While sovereignty is important in Realism, the option seems to be describing the state's characteristics, but traditional Security Studies is more about how states interact and seek security through power dynamics.

So, putting it together, Option A fits best because it directly addresses the balance of power and state strategies based on their power position, which is central to Realism. The other options either focus on specific contexts (like the Cold War in B), norms (C), or sovereignty without the power dynamics (D).

The correct answer is A: Traditional theories explain international politics as the distribution of power among members of an international system, and specifically as the balance of power amongst major states. The relative power and the constraints of a state are reflective of the security strategy of that state.

Answer: A
