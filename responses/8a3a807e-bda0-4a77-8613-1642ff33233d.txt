Okay, so I have this question about leadership theories, specifically the contingency theory of leadership. The question is asking who among the given options is a leading writer on contingency theory. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I need to remember what contingency theory is. From what I recall, contingency theory suggests that the best leadership style depends on the situation. It's not one-size-fits-all; instead, leaders should adapt their approach based on factors like the task, the team, and the environment. This contrasts with trait theory, which focuses on inherent qualities of leaders, or behavioral theories that look at specific actions.

Now, looking at the options:

A: Abraham Maslow – I know he's the guy behind Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs, which is about motivation. Not directly related to leadership theories, so probably not him.

B: Rensis Likert – I think he developed the Likert scale, which is more about measuring attitudes and opinions. But I'm not sure if he's linked to contingency theory.

C: Henry Mintzberg – He's known for his work on management and leadership, including concepts like the five roles of managers. I don't recall him being a main figure in contingency theory.

D: Joan Woodward – She studied organizations and perhaps leadership, but again, I'm not certain about her connection to contingency theory.

E: John Adair – He's known for his Three Circles model of leadership, which focuses on task, team, and individual. That seems a bit related but I'm not sure if it's contingency.

F: Peter Drucker – He's more about management concepts and innovation, not specifically contingency theory.

G: Rosabeth Kanter – She's written about leadership and change, especially in organizations, but I don't think she's a leading figure in contingency theory.

H: Warren Bennis – He's a key thinker in leadership, focusing on the development of leadership qualities, but not sure about contingency.

I: Fred Fiedler – Oh wait, I think Fred Fiedler is the one associated with the Contingency Model of leadership. His theory suggests that a leader's effectiveness depends on the situation, particularly focusing on the leader-member relations, task structure, and position power. That sounds exactly like contingency theory.

J: Douglas McGregor – He's famous for Theory X and Theory Y, which are about management styles, not specifically contingency theory.

So putting it all together, Fred Fiedler (Option I) is the leading writer on contingency theory of leadership. The other options either don't relate or are more connected to different theories or concepts.

The leading writer on contingency theory of leadership among the options is Fred Fiedler, known for his Contingency Model.
