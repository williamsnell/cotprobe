Okay, so I have this genetics problem here about garden peas. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll take it slow.

The question says that in garden peas, the allele for tall plants (D) is completely dominant over the dwarf allele (d). So, if a plant has at least one D, it'll be tall; only if it has two d's will it be dwarf. Similarly, the violet flower color allele (W) is completely dominant over white (w), so Ww or WW would be violet, and only ww would be white.

The cross is between a tall violet plant with genotype DDWw and a dwarf white plant. Wait, the dwarf white—what's its genotype? Since the plant is dwarf, it must be dd, and white means ww. So the genotype is ddww.

I'm supposed to find the phenotypic ratio of the progeny. Phenotypic ratio refers to the expected distribution of traits in the offspring based on the parents' genotypes.

Since these are two separate traits (height and flower color), I can probably use the law of independent assortment, which says that the alleles for different traits are distributed independently during gamete formation. So I can break this down into two monohybrid crosses and then combine the results.

Let's start with the height. The parent plants are DD (tall) and dd (dwarf). What gametes does each produce?

The DD plant can only produce D gametes because it has two dominant alleles. The dd plant can only produce d gametes because it's homozygous recessive.

So when they cross, the offspring for the height trait will be D from the first parent and d from the second. So all the offspring will be Dd for height. Since D is dominant, all these plants will be tall. So 100% tall.

Now for the flower color. The DDWw parent is Ww, and the other parent is ww.

Wait, let me correct that. The first parent has genotype DDWw, so for the Ww part, it's heterozygous. The second parent is ddww, so their genotype for flower color is ww.

So for flower color, the first parent (DDWw) can produce gametes with W or w. Each gamete has a 50% chance of W and 50% chance of w. The second parent (ww) can only produce w gametes.

So when they cross, the possible offspring for flower color are:

- W from first parent and w from second: Ww (violet)
- w from first parent and w from second: ww (white)

So each possibility is 50% because the first parent contributes either W or w, and the second contributes only w.

So for flower color, the expected ratio is 1:1 violet to white.

Wait, but the height is 100% tall. So combining both traits, each offspring will be tall, and half will be violet, half white.

So the phenotypic ratio for the two traits together would be:

- Tall and violet: 50% (since all are tall, and half are violet)
- Tall and white: 50% (all tall, half white)

But let me think again. Because the law of independent assortment applies, the combination of the two traits should be independent. So the possible phenotypes are tall violet, tall white, dwarf violet, dwarf white. But wait, in this case, the parents for the height are DD and dd, so all the offspring will be Dd (tall), right? Because D is dominant. So all the progeny are tall. Therefore, the only variation is in the flower color—violet and white.

So the ratio would be all tall, with half violet and half white. So the phenotypic ratio is 1:1 tall violet to tall white? Wait, no, because the options don't have that. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options, option I is 1 tall violet : 1 dwarf white. That can't be right because all the offspring are tall. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, no. Let me double-check. The first parent is DDWw, so for height, they are DD, so all gametes are D. The second parent is dd, so all gametes are d. So the offspring for height are Dd, which is tall. So all the offspring are tall. So the height is fixed as tall for all.

For flower color, the first parent is Ww, so gametes are W (50%) and w (50%). The second parent is ww, so gametes are w (100%). So the offspring's flower color genotypes will be Ww (50%) and ww (50%). So phenotype-wise, 50% violet (Ww) and 50% white (ww).

So the phenotypic ratio for the two traits is:

All tall (100%), with 50% violet and 50% white. So the ratio is 1:1 violet to white. But wait, because the options are combinations of both traits, perhaps the ratio is 1 tall violet : 1 tall white.

Wait, that would be option I: 1 tall violet : 1 dwarf white. No, dwarf white is not possible because all are tall. So perhaps the correct ratio is 1 tall violet : 1 tall white. But looking at the options, option J is 1 tall violet : 1 tall white, but that would imply no dwarf plants, which is correct because all are tall. So the ratio would be 1:1 for violet to white, all tall. So the phenotypic ratio is 1 tall violet : 1 tall white.

Wait, but looking at the options, option J is 1 tall violet : 1 tall white, which would mean there are only two phenotypes, both tall, but that's not considering that all are tall. Alternatively, perhaps I'm miscounting the combinations.

Wait, perhaps I should consider each possible phenotype as a combination of the two traits. So since all are tall, the possible phenotypes are:

- Tall violet
- Tall white

So the ratio is 1:1. But looking for the option that reflects this, perhaps the correct option is E or I.

Wait, let me check the options again.

Option E: 1 tall violet: 1 tall white: 1 dwarf violet: 1 dwarf white → No, because all are tall.

Option I: 1 tall violet: 1 dwarf white → No, because all are tall.

Option J: 1 tall violet:1 tall white → This would be a 1:1 ratio but only considering these two phenotypes. But wait, that would mean 50% each, so the ratio is 1:1, which matches.

Wait, but another way to look at it is that each of the two traits (flower color) has a 1:1 ratio, and since all are tall, the overall ratio is 1 tall violet : 1 tall white.

But looking at the options, option J is 1 tall violet : 1 tall white. So that would be the correct answer. But wait, the options list possible ratios, and option J doesn't account for the other possibilities, but since all are tall, the only variation is in flower color.

Wait, perhaps I should re-examine the possible options. Let me list the options again.

Options:
A: All dwarf white → No, because all are tall.

B: 1 tall violet: 2 tall white: 1 dwarf white → No, because all are tall.

C: 1 tall violet: 1 dwarf violet: 1 tall white: 1 dwarf white → No, all are tall.

D: All dwarf violet → No.

E: 1 tall violet: 1 tall white: 1 dwarf violet: 1 dwarf white → No, all are tall.

F: All tall violet → No, because half are white.

G: 1 tall violet: 1 dwarf violet → No, all are tall.

H: 2 tall violet: 1 dwarf violet: 1 dwarf white → No, all are tall.

I: 1 tall violet: 1 dwarf white → No, all are tall.

J: 1 tall violet: 1 tall white → This would mean half are violet and half are white, which matches our conclusion.

Wait, but the cross between Ww and ww would produce 50% Ww (violet) and 50% ww (white). So for each trait, the flower color ratio is 1:1. Since all are tall, the phenotypic ratio is 1:1 for violet to white, all being tall. So the correct ratio is 1 tall violet : 1 tall white, which is option J.

Wait, but another approach: each of the two traits is independent, so the expected phenotypic ratio is the product of each trait's ratio. So for height, it's 100% tall, and for flower color, it's 1:1 violet:white. So the combined ratio would be (1 tall) * (1 violet + 1 white) → so the ratio is 1 tall violet : 1 tall white. So yes, option J.

In this cross, the tall violet plant (DDWw) and the dwarf white plant (ddww) are analyzed for their offspring's phenotypic ratio. For height, the DDWw parent produces only D gametes (tall), and the ddww parent produces only d gametes (dwarf). Thus, all offspring inherit the Dd genotype, which is tall due to the dominance of D. For flower color, the DDWw parent produces W and w gametes (50% each), while the ddww parent produces only w gametes. This results in offspring with Ww (violet) and ww (white) genotypes in a 1:1 ratio. Combining both traits, all offspring are tall, with half being violet and half white. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio is 1 tall violet : 1 tall white.
