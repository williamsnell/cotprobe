Question:

Restate the utility-maximizing rule in algebraic terms.

Options:

A: MU_A / Price_B = MU_B / Price_A = MU_C / Price_D = MU_D / Price_C
B: MU_A = MU_B = MU_C = MU_D
C: MU_A + MU_B = Price_A + Price_B
D: MU_A - MU_B = Price_A - Price_B
E: MU_A * MU_B * MU_C * MU_D = Price_A * Price_B * Price_C * Price_D
F: MU_A ^2 / Price_A = MU_B ^2 / Price_B
G: MU_A * Price_A = MU_B * Price_B = MU_C * Price_C = MU_D * Price_D
H: MU_A / MU_B = Price_A / Price_B
I: MU_A / Price_A ^2 = MU_B / Price_B ^2 = MU_C / Price_C ^2 = MU_D / Price_D ^2
J: (MU_A /Price_A) = (MU_B /Price_B) = (MU_C /Price_C) = (MU_D /Price_D)

Okay, so I have this question about the utility-maximizing rule, and I need to restate it in algebraic terms. I remember from my economics class that this rule is about how consumers allocate their income to maximize satisfaction. Let me think about what the rule says.

The utility-maximizing rule, as I recall, states that the consumer should allocate their money in such a way that the marginal utility per dollar spent is equal across all goods. That is, for any two goods, say A and B, the ratio of their marginal utilities to their prices should be the same. So, MU_A divided by Price_A should equal MU_B divided by Price_B. And this should hold true for all goods the consumer is buying.

Looking at the options, I need to find the one that captures this relationship. Let me go through each option.

Option A: MU_A / Price_B = MU_B / Price_A = MU_C / Price_D = MU_D / Price_C. Hmm, this seems to mix up the prices. Like, MU_A over Price_B and MU_B over Price_A. That doesn't sound right because the rule uses each MU over its own price, not another good's price. So I think A is incorrect.

Option B: MU_A = MU_B = MU_C = MU_D. This suggests all marginal utilities are equal, but that's not the case. The rule is about the ratio of MU to price, not the MU itself. So B is probably wrong.

Option C: MU_A + MU_B = Price_A + Price_B. This doesn't make sense because adding marginal utilities to prices doesn't relate to the utility-maximizing condition. So C is out.

Option D: MU_A - MU_B = Price_A - Price_B. Again, subtracting doesn't fit the ratio concept. So D is incorrect.

Option E: MU_A * MU_B * MU_C * MU_D = Price_A * Price_B * Price_C * Price_D. Multiplying all MUs and prices together seems too complicated and not related to the rule. So E is wrong.

Option F: MU_A squared over Price_A equals MU_B squared over Price_B. Squaring the marginal utilities isn't part of the utility-maximizing rule. So F is not correct.

Option G: MU_A * Price_A = MU_B * Price_B = MU_C * Price_C = MU_D * Price_D. Wait, this says that the product of MU and price is equal across all goods. But according to the rule, it's the ratio of MU to price that's equal, not the product. So G is actually the inverse of what we want. So G is incorrect.

Option H: MU_A / MU_B = Price_A / Price_B. This says the ratio of MUs equals the ratio of prices. But the correct ratio is MU over price. So H is not right.

Option I: MU_A / (Price_A squared) equals the same for others. This introduces squares of prices, which isn't part of the standard rule. So I is out.

Option J: (MU_A / Price_A) = (MU_B / Price_B) = (MU_C / Price_C) = (MU_D / Price_D). This matches exactly what I was thinkingâ€”the ratio of each MU to its respective price is equal across all goods. So J must be the correct answer.

The utility-maximizing rule states that consumers allocate their income such that the marginal utility per dollar spent is equal across all goods. In algebraic terms, this is represented as the ratio of marginal utility to price being equal for all goods. Among the options provided, option J correctly states this relationship.

Answer: J
