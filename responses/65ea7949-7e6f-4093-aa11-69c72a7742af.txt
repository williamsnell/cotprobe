Question:

A worker on an assembly line takes 7 hours to produce 22 parts. At that rate how many parts can she produce in 35 hours?

Options:

A: 110 parts
B: 245 parts
C: 770 parts
D: 220 parts
E: 140 parts
F: 200 parts
G: 4 parts
H: 35 parts
I: 100 parts
J: 175 parts

Okay, so I need to figure out how many parts the worker can produce in 35 hours. Let's see, the problem says she takes 7 hours to produce 22 parts. Hmm, I think I should start by finding out how many parts she makes in one hour. That sounds like a good starting point.

So, if she makes 22 parts in 7 hours, her rate per hour would be 22 divided by 7. Let me do that calculation: 22 ÷ 7 is approximately 3.142857 parts per hour. Wait, that seems a bit slow, but okay, maybe that's right.

Now, I need to find out how many parts she can make in 35 hours. So I should multiply her hourly rate by 35 hours. Let me calculate that: 3.142857 parts/hour * 35 hours. Hmm, 3.142857 times 35. Let me do that step by step. 3.142857 times 30 is about 94.2857, and 3.142857 times 5 is about 15.7143. Adding those together gives me roughly 110 parts.

Wait, let me double-check that because I might have made a mistake. Alternatively, maybe I should approach it differently. Instead of calculating per hour, perhaps find out how many parts she makes in 35 hours by scaling up the initial time.

She makes 22 parts in 7 hours. So, how many 7-hour periods are there in 35 hours? Let me divide 35 by 7, which is 5. So she can work 5 times the initial period. Therefore, she can produce 22 parts * 5, which is 110 parts. That matches my earlier calculation.

Looking at the options, option A is 110 parts. So that's the answer. But wait, let me make sure I didn't overlook anything. The question is straightforward, right? It's a simple rate problem. So 22 parts in 7 hours, so 22/7 per hour, and then multiplied by 35 hours. Yep, that's correct.

I think I'm confident with this. So the answer should be A: 110 parts.

The worker produces 22 parts in 7 hours, which is 22/7 ≈ 3.14 parts per hour. Over 35 hours, multiplying 3.14 by 35 gives approximately 110 parts. Alternatively, since 35 is 5 times 7, she can make 22 * 5 = 110 parts.
