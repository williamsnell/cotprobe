Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out how many coulombs are required to deposit 0.10 grams of zinc. Hmm, I remember that this has to do with electrochemistry, maybe something about Faraday's laws. Let me try to think this through step by step.

First, I recall that Faraday's laws relate the amount of substance deposited to the electric charge passed. The key formula I think is Q = n * F, where Q is the charge in coulombs, n is the number of moles, and F is Faraday's constant, which is approximately 96,485 coulombs per mole. But wait, I should double-check what F is exactly. Oh right, yes, F is about 96,485 C/mol.

So, the problem gives me the mass of zinc as 0.10 grams, and the atomic mass is 65.38 g/mol. I think I need to find the number of moles of zinc first. Moles = mass / molar mass. So that would be 0.10 g divided by 65.38 g/mol. Let me calculate that.

0.10 divided by 65.38 is approximately 0.00153 moles. Wait, no, wait. Wait, 65.38 grams per mole is the molar mass, so 0.10 grams is 0.10 / 65.38 = approximately 0.001529 moles. Let me write that down: n ≈ 0.001529 mol.

But wait, zinc has a valence of 2. Oh right, because zinc typically has a charge of +2, so each mole of Zn²+ ions would require 2 moles of electrons. So for every mole of Zn, 2 moles of electrons are involved. Hmm, but how does that fit into the calculation?

I think the formula for the charge is Q = n * valence * F. So in this case, n is the moles of Zn, and valence is 2. So Q = (0.001529 mol) * 2 * 96485 C/mol. Let me calculate that.

First, multiply 0.001529 by 2: that's about 0.003058 mol of electrons. Then multiply by 96485 C/mol. So 0.003058 * 96485 ≈ let's see. Let's compute it step by step.

0.003058 * 96485. Let's break it down: 0.003 * 96485 = 289.455, and 0.000058 *96485 ≈ 5.6 (since 0.00005 *96485=4.82425, and 0.000008 *96485≈0.77188, so total around 5.596). So adding together, 289.455 + 5.596 ≈ 295.05 coulombs.

Wait, that's about 295 coulombs. Looking at the options, option E is 295 coulomb. So that's the answer.

Wait, did I make any mistakes? Let me check the steps again. Mass is 0.10g, atomic mass 65.38, so moles of Zn is 0.10 /65.38 ≈ 0.001529. Valence is 2, so electrons per Zn atom is 2. So total n (electrons) is 0.001529 * 2 = 0.003058 mol. Multiply by F (96485 C/mol): 0.003058 *96485 ≈ 295 C. Yep, that seems right.

To determine the number of coulombs required to deposit 0.10 grams of zinc, we use Faraday's laws of electrolysis. The steps are as follows:

1. **Calculate the number of moles of zinc**:  
   Using the formula \( n = \frac{\text{mass}}{\text{molar mass}} \),  
   \( n = \frac{0.10 \, \text{g}}{65.38 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.001529 \, \text{mol} \).

2. **Account for the valence of zinc**:  
   Zinc has a valence of 2, meaning each mole of zinc requires 2 moles of electrons.  
   \( \text{Moles of electrons} = 0.001529 \, \text{mol} \times 2 = 0.003058 \, \text{mol} \).

3. **Calculate the total charge**:  
   Using the formula \( Q = n \times F \), where \( F = 96485 \, \text{C/mol} \),  
   \( Q = 0.003058 \, \text{mol} \times 96485 \, \text{C/mol} \approx 295 \, \text{C} \).

Thus, the required charge is approximately **295 coulombs**, which corresponds to option **E**.
