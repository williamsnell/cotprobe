Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem says: A circular coil with a diameter of 20 mm is placed in a uniform magnetic flux density of 100 mT. The coil's plane is perpendicular to the magnetic field direction. I need to find the total flux threading the coil. The options are from A to J, and I have to choose the correct one.

Hmm, right. I remember that magnetic flux is calculated using the formula Φ = B * A * cosθ, where Φ is the flux, B is the magnetic field strength, A is the area of the coil, and θ is the angle between the magnetic field and the normal to the coil's surface.

In this problem, the coil's plane is perpendicular to the magnetic field. Wait, wait—so if the plane is perpendicular, that means the magnetic field is coming straight out of the plane. Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the normal vector. The normal to the plane would be perpendicular to the plane. So if the plane is perpendicular to the magnetic field, then the angle between the magnetic field and the normal is 0 degrees, right? Because the normal is pointing in the same direction as the field.

So cosθ would be cos(0°), which is 1. That simplifies the formula to Φ = B * A.

Now, I need to calculate the area A of the coil. The coil is circular with a diameter of 20 mm. So the radius r is half of that, which is 10 mm. To convert that into meters, since the magnetic field is given in millitesla, perhaps I should work in centimeters or meters. Wait, 10 mm is 0.01 meters.

The area A of a circle is πr². Plugging in r = 0.01 m, A = π * (0.01)^2 = π * 0.0001 m². Let me compute that: 0.0001 is 1e-4, so π * 1e-4 is approximately 3.1416e-4 m².

Wait, wait, but let me check the units again. The magnetic flux density B is given as 100 mT. Oh, right, mT is millitesla, which is 10^-3 T. So 100 mT is 0.1 T.

Now, putting it all together. Φ = B * A = 0.1 T * 3.1416e-4 m².

Let me calculate that. 0.1 * 3.1416e-4 equals 3.1416e-5 Weber. Wait, but the options are given in microWebers (μWb), and I know that 1 Weber is 1e6 microWebers. So 3.1416e-5 Wb is equal to 3.1416e-5 * 1e6 μWb, which is 31.416 μWb. Hmm, looking at the options, option E is 31.4 μWb. So that's probably the correct answer.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the area calculation. Let me double-check. The diameter is 20 mm, so radius is 10 mm, which is 0.01 meters. Area is πr², so π*(0.01)^2 = π*0.0001. That's correct. 0.0001 is 1e-4, so 3.1416e-4 m². Oh wait, no, wait—that's not right. Wait, 0.01 squared is 0.0001, so A = π * 0.0001 = 3.1416e-4 m². Oh, okay, that's correct.

Wait, but when I multiply B (0.1 T) by A (3.1416e-4 m²), I get 0.1 * 3.1416e-4 = 3.1416e-5 Wb, which is 31.416 μWb. So that's approximately 31.4 μWb, which is option E.

Wait, but another thought: Did I mess up the units somewhere? Let me check. The diameter is in mm, so 20 mm is 0.02 meters in diameter. So the radius is 0.01 meters. Area is π*(0.01)^2 = π*0.0001 m². Yes, that's correct. So the area is 3.1416e-4 m². Multiplying by B in Tesla gives flux in Weber.

Wait, another way: 100 mT is 0.1 T. So 0.1 T * area in m² gives Weber. So 0.1 * (π*(0.01)^2) = 0.1 * π * 0.0001 = π * 0.00001. Which is π * 1e-5 = approx 3.1416e-5 Wb. Which is 31.416 μWb. So yes, option E is 31.4 μWb, which matches.

To determine the total magnetic flux threading the coil, we use the formula:

\[
\Phi = B \cdot A \cdot \cos\theta
\]

Here, \( B = 100 \, \text{mT} = 0.1 \, \text{T} \), the coil's diameter is \( 20 \, \text{mm} \), so the radius \( r = 10 \, \text{mm} = 0.01 \, \text{m} \), and since the coil's plane is perpendicular to the magnetic field, \( \theta = 0^\circ \), making \( \cos\theta = 1 \).

The area \( A \) of the circular coil is:

\[
A = \pi r^2 = \pi (0.01)^2 = \pi \cdot 0.0001 \, \text{m}^2 \approx 3.1416 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{m}^2
\]

Substituting into the flux formula:

\[
\Phi = 0.1 \cdot 3.1416 \times 10^{-4} = 3.1416 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{Wb} = 31.416 \, \mu\text{Wb}
\]

Rounding to one decimal place, the flux is approximately \( 31.4 \, \mu\text{Wb} \), which corresponds to option E.
