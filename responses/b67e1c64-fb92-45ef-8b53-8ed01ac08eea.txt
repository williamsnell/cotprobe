Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the transition from food gathering to relying on agriculture. The question is asking which statement correctly describes that transition. Let's go through the options one by one.

First, the question is about when and how humans shifted from gathering food to farming. I remember that this shift is often referred to as the Neolithic Revolution. It's a big deal because it led to the rise of civilizations, settled communities, and all that came with it.

Looking at the options:

A: was driven solely by population growth. Hmm, I think population growth might have been a factor, but I don't think it was the only reason. People started farming because of environmental changes, the development of better tools, and maybe social reasons too. So 'solely' might make A incorrect.

B: only occurred in Europe and Asia. Wait, I recall that agriculture started in several regions, like the Fertile Crescent in the Middle East, parts of China, India, Africa, and the Americas too. So saying it only happened in Europe and Asia isn't right. So B is probably wrong.

C: took hundreds of thousands of years. Let me think. The Neolithic Revolution is thought to have started around 12,000 years ago, maybe earlier. So that's about 12,000 years, not hundreds of thousands. So C would be incorrect.

D: always required careful planning. Well, starting agriculture would require planning, like choosing good land, planting at the right time, etc. But 'always' is a strong word. Maybe some societies figured it out without as much planning, or maybe early attempts were more trial and error. So I'm not sure about D.

E: happened everywhere except in South America. Wait, South America had agriculture too, like in the Andes with potatoes. So E is incorrect because it did happen there.

F: was not possible without domesticated animals. I'm not sure. Some early farming might have started without domesticated animals, relying on plants. Domestication of animals probably came later. So F might not be correct.

G: was a direct result of advancements in technology. That sounds plausible. Better tools and knowledge would allow for farming. But was it the only reason? Maybe not. So G could be a contender, but I'm not certain it's the best option.

H: happened overnight. No way. The transition took thousands of years, so H is wrong.

I: only took place in societies with a written language. No, I think some early farming societies didn't have writing. They had spoken languages but not written records. So I is incorrect.

J: took thousands of years. That sounds right. The shift from gathering to agriculture was a gradual process over a long period, thousands of years. So J seems correct.

Now, looking back at the options, J is definitely correct because the transition was a slow process spanning thousands of years, not a quick change. So the answer should be J.

The transition from food gathering to agriculture, known as the Neolithic Revolution, was a gradual process that took thousands of years. This period involved significant changes in human society, including the development of farming techniques, the domestication of plants and animals, and the establishment of settled communities. It did not occur overnight, nor was it solely driven by population growth or limited to specific regions like Europe and Asia. While advancements in technology played a role, the transition was not a direct result of technology alone. Additionally, the shift to agriculture occurred in various parts of the world, including South America, and did not require a written language. Therefore, the correct answer is that this transition took thousands of years.

Answer: J
