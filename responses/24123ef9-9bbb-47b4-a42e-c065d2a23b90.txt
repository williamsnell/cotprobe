Answer:
    
<think>
Okay, so I have this probability problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again.

The question is about order statistics. We have Y₁ < Y₂ < Y₃ < Y₄ < Y₅ < Y₆, which are the order statistics from a random sample of size n=6. The distribution is continuous, and it has a (100p)th percentile π_p. The task is to compute the probability P(Y₂ < π₀.₅ < Y₅). The options are given from A to J.

Hmm, so π₀.₅ is the median of the distribution, right? Because the 50th percentile is the median. So the question is asking the probability that the second order statistic Y₂ is less than the median, and the fifth order statistic Y₅ is greater than the median.

I remember that for order statistics, especially in a sample from a continuous distribution, the probability that the median falls between Y_k and Y_{n+1−k} can be calculated using certain properties. Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the distribution of the sample percentiles.

Alternatively, I recall that for a sample median, the probability that Y₂ < median < Y₅ might relate to the coverage probability of the median when using order statistics. But I'm a bit confused about the exact approach.

Wait, let's think about the general case. For order statistics Y_1, Y_2, ..., Y_n, the probability that Y_j < π_p < Y_{n+1−j} is given by 1 - (p)^(n choose j). Is that right? Or maybe it's something else.

Alternatively, I think the probability that the median (which is the 50th percentile) is between Y₂ and Y₅ in a sample of size 6. So n=6, and we're looking at the second and fifth order statistics.

I remember that for a sample of size n, the probability that the p-th percentile lies between Y_{k} and Y_{n+1−k} is 1 - (1 - p)^k - p^{n+1−k}. Or maybe it's 1 - (p)^k - (1-p)^{n+1−k}.

Wait, let me think again. The probability that the median is less than or equal to Y_j is the probability that at least half of the sample is less than or equal to Y_j. Similarly, the probability that the median is greater than or equal to Y_{n+1−j} is the probability that at least half are greater than or equal to Y_{n+1−j}.

But in our case, we want the median to be between Y₂ and Y₅. So, P(Y₂ < median < Y₅) is equal to P(Y₅ > median) minus P(Y₂ < median). Or maybe it's the complement of both P(Y₂ >= median) and P(Y₅ <= median). Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, there's a formula for the probability that the median lies between two order statistics. For a sample of size n, the probability that Y_k < median < Y_{n+1−k} is equal to 1 - (k / (n+1)). Wait, that doesn't sound right. Or maybe it's more complicated.

Wait, let me try to recall. For the median to lie between Y_j and Y_{n+1−j}, the number of observations less than Y_j must be less than n/2, and the number greater than Y_{n+1−j} must be less than n/2. But since n=6, which is even, the median would typically be between Y₃ and Y₄. But in this question, it's between Y₂ and Y₅.

Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think of it in terms of the distribution function.

Let F be the distribution function. Then, the probability that the median is less than Y_j is the probability that at least (n+1)/2 observations are less than Y_j. Since n=6, 3 observations. So, P(median < Y_j) = P(Y_j is the 3rd smallest) but I'm not sure.

Wait, more accurately, the median is the value such that P(X <= median) = 0.5. So, for Y₂ < median < Y₅, we can think about the number of observations less than Y₂ and greater than Y₅.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to consider all possible ranks. For the median to be greater than Y₂, at least 3 observations must be greater than Y₂. Similarly, for the median to be less than Y₅, at least 3 observations must be less than Y₅.

Wait, but since the distribution is continuous, the probability that an observation equals Y_j is zero, so we can treat them as strict inequalities.

So, the event Y₂ < median < Y₅ is equivalent to the event that at least 3 observations are less than Y₅ and at least 3 observations are greater than Y₂.

Wait, but how does that relate? Let me think step by step.

The median is the middle value when n is odd, but here n is even, so the median is typically considered as the average of Y₃ and Y₄. But in some contexts, especially when dealing with order statistics, the median can refer to the position where half the data is below and half above. So, in our case, the median would be between Y₃ and Y₄. But the question is about Y₂ and Y₅. So perhaps we need to compute the probability that Y₂ < median and median < Y₅.

Wait, maybe another approach. If we have 6 observations, the probability that the median is between Y₂ and Y₅ is equal to the probability that Y₂ < median < Y₅. Since the median is at position 3 in the ordered sample when considering the lower half and position 4 for the upper half. Wait, not exactly.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to model this using the properties of order statistics. For a uniform distribution, the probability that the median (which would be the average of Y₃ and Y₄) lies between Y₂ and Y₅ can be calculated, but the question is for a general continuous distribution. However, I think the probability is the same regardless of the distribution because it's a property of order statistics.

Wait, yes, I think for any continuous distribution, the probability that Y₂ < median < Y₅ is the same as the probability that the median is between the second and fifth order statistics in a sample of size 6.

So, perhaps I can model this using the expectation of the indicator variable or use combinatorial probabilities.

Let me think combinatorially. The median being between Y₂ and Y₅ implies that in the sample, at least two observations are less than the median and at least two are greater than the median. Wait, no, that might not be accurate.

Wait, for the median to be greater than Y₂, at least three of the six observations must be greater than Y₂. Similarly, for the median to be less than Y₅, at least three observations must be less than Y₅.

But Y₂ is the second smallest, so all observations except Y₁ and Y₂ are greater than Y₂. So, the number of observations greater than Y₂ is 4. So, the probability that the median is greater than Y₂ is 1, because there are 4 observations greater than Y₂, which is more than half of 6. So that doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, no. The median is the middle value. For n=6, the median is typically the average of Y₃ and Y₄. So, Y₂ is the second smallest, Y₅ is the fifth smallest. So, the median is between Y₃ and Y₄, which are both between Y₂ and Y₅. So, the median is always between Y₂ and Y₅, but that can't be correct because the options don't include 1.

Wait, no, that's not correct. The median is the middle value, so in a sample of 6, it's between Y₃ and Y₄. So Y₂ is before Y₃, and Y₅ is after Y₄. Therefore, the median is always between Y₂ and Y₅, but that can't be because the probability can't be 1.

Wait, no, that's not right. Because the median is the middle of the ordered sample. So for example, if all six observations are the same, the median would equal all of them, but since it's continuous, that's impossible. But in general, the median is somewhere in the middle. So perhaps the probability that Y₂ < median < Y₅ is 1, but that's not an option. So I must be misunderstanding.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the 50th percentile, which is the median, and asks if it's between Y₂ and Y₅. But in a sample of size 6, the median is between Y₃ and Y₄. So, Y₂ is less than Y₃, which is less than Y₄, which is less than Y₅. Therefore, Y₂ < Y₃ < median < Y₄ < Y₅. So the median is always between Y₂ and Y₅, so the probability should be 1. But that's not one of the options. So I must be making a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the notation. Maybe π₀.₅ is the 50th percentile, which is the median, but in some cases, the median could be outside Y₂ and Y₅. No, that can't be. Because Y₂ is the second smallest, Y₅ is the fifth smallest, and the median is between Y₃ and Y₄. So Y₂ < Y₃ < median < Y₄ < Y₅, so Y₂ < median < Y₅ must always be true. Therefore, the probability should be 1. But that's not an option. So I'm definitely missing something.

Wait, wait, perhaps the question is not about the median of the population but about the sample median. No, the question says the distribution has a 50th percentile π_p, so π_0.5 is the population median. The sample is taken from this distribution. So the question is about the probability that the population median lies between the second and fifth order statistics of the sample.

Wait, that makes more sense. So it's not about the sample median, but the population median being between Y₂ and Y₅ in the sample.

Hmm, okay, so I need to compute P(Y₂ < π₀.₅ < Y₅). That is, the probability that the population median is between the second and fifth order statistics of the sample.

I think I remember that for order statistics, the probability that π_p lies between Y_j and Y_{n+1−j} is given by 1 - (p)^j - (1-p)^{n+1−j}.

Wait, let me check. For example, when j=1 and n+1−j=6, so 1 - p^1 - (1-p)^6. But I'm not sure if that's correct.

Alternatively, I think the probability that Y_j < π_p < Y_{n+1−j} is equal to 1 - (p)^j - (1-p)^{n+1−j}.

Wait, let me think for a moment. Suppose we have n=6, j=2, so n+1−j=5. So the formula would be 1 - (0.5)^2 - (0.5)^5.

Wait, 0.5 squared is 0.25, 0.5^5 is 0.03125. So 1 - 0.25 - 0.03125 = 0.71875. Hmm, but that's not one of the options. Wait, the options are A:0.7137, J:0.7812, etc.

Wait, maybe I'm applying the formula incorrectly. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is 1 - (p)^{j} - (1-p)^{j}.

Wait, let me try to reason it out. The probability that the population median is less than Y_j is equal to the probability that at least j-1 observations are less than the median. Since the median is the 50th percentile, the probability that a single observation is less than the median is 0.5. So, the probability that at least j-1 observations are less than the median is the same as the probability that Y_j is less than the median. Wait, no, that's not precise.

Wait, more accurately, the probability that the median is less than Y_j is the probability that at least (n+1)/2 of the observations are less than Y_j. For n=6, that's 3.5, but since we can't have half, perhaps it's 3 or more.

Wait, but the median is the value where half the population is below and half above. So, for the sample, the probability that Y_j is less than the median is the probability that at least 3 of the 6 observations are less than Y_j. Because if 3 or more are less than Y_j, then the median would be less than or equal to Y_j.

Similarly, the probability that Y_{n+1−j} is greater than the median is the probability that at least 3 of the 6 observations are greater than Y_{n+1−j}.

So, for our case, j=2. So, P(Y₂ < median) is the probability that at least 3 of the 6 are less than Y₂. But wait, Y₂ is the second smallest, so all observations after Y₂ are greater than Y₂. So, the number of observations greater than Y₂ is 4. Therefore, the number of observations less than Y₂ is 1 (only Y₁). So, the probability that at least 3 are less than Y₂ is zero, because only Y₁ is less than Y₂. So P(Y₂ < median) is zero? That can't be right because the median is between Y₂ and Y₅.

Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting confused here. Let me think again.

The probability that the median is less than Y_j is the probability that at least (n+1)/2 = 3.5, which is 4 observations, are less than Y_j. Wait, that can't be because Y_j is the j-th order statistic. So, the number of observations less than Y_j is exactly j-1. So, for Y₂, the number of observations less than Y₂ is 1 (only Y₁). So, the probability that the median is less than Y₂ is the probability that at least 3 observations are less than Y₂, which is impossible because only Y₁ is less than Y₂. Therefore, P(Y₂ < median) = 0.

Similarly, the probability that the median is greater than Y₅ is the probability that at least 3 observations are greater than Y₅. But Y₅ is the fifth order statistic, so only Y₆ is greater than Y₅. So, the number of observations greater than Y₅ is 1, which is less than 3, so P(median > Y₅) = 0.

Wait, but that would imply that the median is always between Y₂ and Y₅, but that's not correct because the sample could have all observations very close to each other, but in a continuous distribution, the probability that Y₂ < median < Y₅ is not necessarily 1.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the approach. Let's try a different method. The probability that the population median lies between Y₂ and Y₅ is equal to the probability that at least 2 observations are less than the median and at least 2 are greater than the median. Because Y₂ is the second smallest, so there's 1 observation less than Y₂, and Y₅ is the fifth smallest, so there's 1 observation greater than Y₅. So, the number of observations less than the median must be at least 2 (so Y₂ is less than the median) and the number of observations greater than the median must be at least 2 (so the median is less than Y₅).

Wait, that makes more sense. So, we can model this as the probability that in 6 independent observations, exactly k are less than the median, and the rest are greater. Since the median is the 50th percentile, each observation has a 0.5 chance of being less than or greater than the median.

So, the probability that exactly k observations are less than the median is given by the binomial distribution: C(6, k) * (0.5)^k * (0.5)^{6−k} = C(6, k) * (0.5)^6.

Now, for Y₂ < median < Y₅, we need at least 2 observations less than the median (so Y₂ is one of them, and at least one more) and at least 2 observations greater than the median (so Y₅ is one of them, and at least one more).

Wait, but if we have exactly 2 observations less than the median, then Y₂ would be the second one, and the rest would be greater. So, the median would be between Y₂ and Y₃, which is less than Y₅. Similarly, if we have exactly 3,4, or 5 observations less than the median, the median would still be between Y₂ and Y₅.

Wait, let's think about it. If exactly 2 observations are less than the median, then Y₂ is the second one, and Y₃ is the first one greater. So the median would be between Y₂ and Y₃, which is still less than Y₅.

If exactly 3 observations are less than the median, Y₃ would be the third one, and the median would be between Y₃ and Y₄, which is still less than Y₅.

Similarly, if 4 are less, then Y₄ is the fourth, and the median is between Y₄ and Y₅? Wait, no, because with 4 less, the median would be between Y₃ and Y₄, but Y₅ is higher.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the positions. Let me think again.

In any case, the number of observations less than the median can be 0,1,2,3,4,5,6. But since we need Y₂ < median and median < Y₅, we need at least 2 observations less than the median and at least 2 greater.

So, the number of observations less than the median must be 2,3,4, or 5.

Because if there are exactly 2 less, then Y₂ is the second, and Y₃ is the first greater. So the median is between Y₂ and Y₃, which is less than Y₅.

If there are 3 less, Y₃ is the third, and the median is between Y₃ and Y₄, still less than Y₅.

If there are 4 less, Y₄ is the fourth, and the median is between Y₃ and Y₄, which is still less than Y₅.

If there are 5 less, Y₅ is the fifth, and the median is between Y₅ and Y₆, but wait, that would mean the median is greater than Y₅, which is not allowed. So actually, if there are 5 less, then Y₅ is the fifth, and Y₆ is the sixth. The median would be between Y₅ and Y₆, which is greater than Y₅, so that would violate the condition that median < Y₅. So, in that case, the condition is not met.

Similarly, if there are exactly 1 less, then Y₁ is less, Y₂ is the second, and the median is between Y₂ and Y₃, but that still satisfies Y₂ < median < Y₅. Wait, but 1 less than the median would mean only Y₁ is less, and Y₂ is the first greater? No, that's not correct. Because Y₂ is the second order statistic, so if there's exactly 1 less than the median, then Y₁ is less, and Y₂ is the first greater. So the median would be between Y₁ and Y₂, which is less than Y₂, so Y₂ would be greater than the median. But the condition requires Y₂ < median. So that's not allowed.

Similarly, if there are exactly 0 less, then all are greater, which can't happen because the median is the 50th percentile, so half are less and half are more.

Wait, but in a continuous distribution, the probability of exactly k observations being less than the median is a binomial probability.

So, the probability that the number of observations less than the median is k is C(6, k) * (0.5)^6.

So, to have Y₂ < median < Y₅, we need the number of observations less than the median to be at least 2 and at most 4. Because if there are 2,3,4 less, then Y₂ is less than median and median is less than Y₅.

If there are 5 less, then Y₅ is less than the median, which would not satisfy median < Y₅.

Similarly, if there are 1 or 0 less, then the median is less than Y₂, which doesn't satisfy Y₂ < median.

So the total probability is the sum of the probabilities for k=2,3,4.

So P = C(6,2)*(0.5)^6 + C(6,3)*(0.5)^6 + C(6,4)*(0.5)^6.

Calculating each term:

C(6,2)=15, C(6,3)=20, C(6,4)=15.

So total is (15 + 20 +15) * (1/64) = 50/64 = 25/32 ≈ 0.78125.

Looking at the options, J is 0.7812, which is 25/32, so that must be the answer.
</think>

To compute \( P(Y_2 < \pi_{0.5} < Y_5) \), we consider the number of observations less than the median (\( k \)) in a sample of size 6. For the median to lie between \( Y_2 \) and \( Y_5 \), we need at least 2 observations less than the median and at most 4 observations less than the median. This ensures \( Y_2 < \pi_{0.5} < Y_5 \).

The probability is calculated using the binomial distribution, where each observation has a 0.5 chance of being less than the median. The total probability is the sum of probabilities for \( k = 2, 3, 4 \):

\[
P = \binom{6}{2} \left(0.5\right)^6 + \binom{6}{3} \left(0.5\right)^6 + \binom{6}{4} \left(0.5\right)^6
\]

Calculating each term:

\[
\binom{6}{2} = 15, \quad \binom{6}{3} = 20, \quad \binom{6}{4} = 15
\]

\[
P = (15 + 20 + 15) \times \frac{1}{64} = 50 \times \frac{1}{64} = \frac{25}{32} \approx 0.7812
\]

Thus, the probability is \( 0.7812 \), corresponding to option J.

Answer: J
