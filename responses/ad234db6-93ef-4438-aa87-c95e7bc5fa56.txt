Okay, so I've got this economics question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again: "If your nominal income rises 4 percent and your real income falls 1 percent, by how much did the price level change?" The options are from A to J, and I need to pick the correct one.

Hmm, I remember that nominal income is the money you earn before adjusting for inflation, right? And real income is your nominal income adjusted for inflation, so it's what you can actually buy with your income after prices have gone up or down. So if real income falls, that means inflation must have eroded the purchasing power.

Wait, so the formula I think I need is the one that relates real income to nominal income and the price level. I'm trying to recall... Oh yeah, real income equals nominal income divided by the price level. So in formula terms, it's something like Real Income = Nominal Income / Price Level.

But wait, when we talk about percentage changes, maybe I should think in terms of the change in nominal income and the change in real income to find the change in the price level. Let me think about the relationship between these variables.

If nominal income increases by 4%, that means if my nominal income was, say, $100, now it's $104. But my real income has fallen by 1%, so if my real income was also $100 before, now it's $99. So the formula in terms of changes would be the percentage change in real income equals the percentage change in nominal income minus the percentage change in the price level. Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Maybe it's the other way around.

Oh, right! The formula for the percentage change in real income is the percentage change in nominal income minus the percentage change in the price level. So, in symbols, ΔReal ≈ ΔNominal - ΔPrice.

Wait, but wait, I think I'm mixing up something. Let me get this straight. The real income is nominal income divided by the price level. So, when the price level goes up, real income goes down if nominal income stays the same. So, if nominal income goes up by 4%, but real income goes down by 1%, that implies that the price level must have gone up by some amount.

Let me write down the variables to make it clearer. Let me denote:

Let’s say initial nominal income is Y, initial price level is P, so initial real income is Y/P.

After the changes, nominal income becomes Y*(1 + 0.04) = 1.04Y.

Let’s say the price level increases by x percent, so P becomes P*(1 + x).

The new real income is (1.04Y) / (P*(1 + x)).

We are told that real income falls by 1%, so the new real income is (Y/P) * (1 - 0.01) = 0.99*(Y/P).

So, setting the two expressions equal:

(1.04Y) / (P*(1 + x)) = 0.99*(Y/P)

The Y/P terms cancel out on both sides, so we have:

1.04 / (1 + x) = 0.99

Now, solving for (1 + x):

1 + x = 1.04 / 0.99

Let me compute that. 1.04 divided by 0.99. Hmm, 0.99 is approximately 1, so 1.04 / 0.99 is a bit more than 1.04. Let me calculate it exactly.

1.04 / 0.99 ≈ 1.0505 (since 0.99 * 1.05 = 1.0395, and 0.99 * 1.0505 is about 1.04, because 0.99*0.05 is 0.0495, so 1.0505 *0.99 = 1.04).

So 1 + x ≈ 1.0505, which means x ≈ 0.0505, or 5.05%. So the price level increased by approximately 5.05%, which is roughly a 5% increase.

Wait, but looking at the options, option E is 5 percent increase. So that's the answer, right? But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a calculation error.

Alternatively, maybe I can think about it in terms of approximate percentages. If nominal income increases by 4%, and real income decreases by 1%, then the price level must have increased by roughly 5%, because 4% minus the price increase equals the real income change. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again.

Wait, the formula I used earlier was correct: ΔReal ≈ ΔNominal - ΔPrice. So rearranged, ΔPrice ≈ ΔNominal - ΔReal.

Wait, but that can't be exactly right because ΔReal is negative here. Let me plug in the numbers.

ΔNominal is +4%, ΔReal is -1%. So according to the formula, ΔPrice ≈ 4% - (-1%) = 5%. So that aligns with the earlier calculation. So the price level increased by 5%, which is option E.

Wait, but let me check the calculation again to be sure. 1.04 / 0.99 equals approximately 1.0505, which is a 5.05% increase. So rounding to the nearest whole number, that's 5%. So option E is correct.

The correct answer is E: 5 percent increase.

The price level increased by approximately 5 percent.
