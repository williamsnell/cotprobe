Question:

An owner-retailer in a small shopping center entered into a sale-leaseback arrangement with an investor. The retailer stayed in possession and became the lessee for the next 25 years with monthly payments and various obligations regarding maintaining the property. The retailer had to pay most of the expenses on the property, and had options for further extensions but not to purchase the property back. Within a few years, lessee's business grew and he wanted to tear down one of the buildings and attach a new building to his store. The investor refused to consent. Lessee filed suit asking for an order compelling compliance. Will the court likely order the investor to comply with the lessor's demands?

Options:

A: Yes, the lessee will be able to make the improvements without the investor's consent but the improvements will belong to the investor.
B: No, because in every sale-leaseback agreement, there is a clause guaranteeing that the lessee cannot make improvements without the written consent of the investor.
C: No, because the investor can deny any changes that they think will devalue the property.
D: Yes, because the lessee's equity interest surpasses the investor's interest, giving the lessee the right to make improvements.
E: Yes, because the lessee has the right to make alterations to improve business operations.
F: Yes, since the lessee's business is growing and needs expansion, the investor should comply.
G: Yes, because the lessee has the right to make changes as he is the one paying for the property.
H: No, the investor has the final say in any changes to the property since they are the legal owner.
I: No, it will preclude the lessee from making such drastic changes without the investor's consent.

Okay, so I've got this question about a sale-leaseback arrangement between an owner-retailer and an investor. Let me try to break it down. 

First, the setup: the retailer sold the property to the investor but then leased it back for 25 years. So the retailer is the lessee, and the investor is the lessor. The retailer is responsible for most expenses and has options to extend the lease but can't buy it back. Now, the retailer wants to tear down a building and build a new one attached to their store. The investor refused consent, and the lessee sued.

The question is whether the court will order the investor to comply with the lessee's demands. The options are A through I, but I need to figure out which one is correct.

I remember that in a sale-leaseback, the lessee typically has the right to use the property but not to own it. The lessor retains ownership. So, the lessee's rights are usually set out in the lease agreement. 

In most leases, especially commercial ones, the lessee usually needs the lessor's consent to make significant changes or improvements. This is because the lessor owns the property and has an interest in maintaining its value. Without consent, the lessee might not have the right to make such changes. 

Looking at the options:

A: Says the lessee can make improvements without consent but the improvements belong to the investor. That might be true if the lease allows it, but the question is whether the lessee can do it without consent. The problem is the investor refused, so A might not be correct unless the lease allows it regardless.

B: Claims every sale-leaseback has a clause preventing improvements without written consent. I'm not sure if every single one does, but many do. However, this option is an absolute statement, which might be too broad.

C: States the investor can deny changes that devalue the property. That sounds reasonable because the lessor's interest is in maintaining property value. So if the change would devalue it, the investor can refuse.

D: Suggests the lessee's equity surpasses the investor's, giving them the right. I don't think equity in the lease gives the lessee ownership rights to make changes without consent.

E: Says the lessee has the right to make alterations to improve business. But without the lease allowing it, this might not hold. Many leases require consent, especially for structural changes.

F: Argues the lessee's growth means the investor should comply. While growth is a good reason, the investor's rights are based on the lease terms, not just business needs.

G: Claims the lessee pays the property costs, so they can make changes. But paying expenses doesn't automatically grant the right to alter the structure without consent.

H: States the investor has final say since they're the legal owner. This makes sense because the lessor owns the property, and major changes could affect their asset.

I: Says the lessee can't make drastic changes without consent. This aligns with what I was thinking earlier.

So, looking at the options, H and I seem plausible. H is more about ownership rights, while I is about needing consent. But the question is whether the court will order compliance. If the lease requires consent, and the investor refused, the lessee can't force it without a specific clause.

In many cases, the court would side with the lessor because they have the right to control their property. So the answer is likely either H or I. 

Wait, option I says "No, it will preclude the lessee from making such drastic changes without the investor's consent." That sounds correct because the lessee can't make drastic changes without consent unless the lease allows it. But option H says the investor has final say as the legal owner. Both could be correct, but I think the better answer is H because it's a general principle that the owner can control the property use unless the lease says otherwise.

Alternatively, I might be leaning towards I because it's more about the necessity of consent, which is a standard lease clause. But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe the correct answer is H because the investor is the legal owner, so they have the authority to deny changes.

The correct answer is H: No, the investor has the final say in any changes to the property since they are the legal owner. 

Answer: H
