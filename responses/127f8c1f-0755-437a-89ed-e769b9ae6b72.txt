Question:

Two alternatives for interconnecting a set of processors with bidirectional links are (1) the fully interconnected network, in which each processor is directly connected to every other processor, and (2) the ring network, in which each processor is connected to two other processors. The worst-case path length for a network is the maximum, over all pairs of nodes in the network, of the minimum length paths (measured in number of links) between the nodes. For each type of interconnection of n processors, a figure of merit can be formed as the product of the number of links required for the network times the worst-case path length connecting any two processors. The ratio of this figure of merit for the fully interconnected network compared to that of the ring network, for even n > 2, is

Options:

A: (n-1)/n
B: 1/(2n)
C: 1/(n^2)
D: n/(n-1)
E: 1/(n(n-1))
F: 1/n
G: 1/(n+1)
H: n^2
I: (n+1)/n
J: 2n

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about interconnecting processors. The question is comparing two network types: a fully interconnected network and a ring network. I need to find the ratio of their figures of merit for even n > 2. 

First, I should understand what the figure of merit is. It's the product of the number of links required and the worst-case path length between any two processors. So for each network type, I calculate these two factors and then take their product. Then, I find the ratio of the figure of merit for the fully connected network to that of the ring network.

Let's break it down step by step.

Starting with the fully interconnected network, also known as a complete graph. In a complete graph with n processors, each processor is connected to every other processor. So each node has degree (n-1), and the total number of links is n*(n-1)/2. Because each link is counted twice when considering each node's connections.

Next, the worst-case path length in a fully connected network. Since every processor is directly connected, the maximum distance between any two processors is 1. Because you can go directly from any node to any other node in one step. So the minimal path length is always 1 for any pair. Therefore, the worst-case path length (also called diameter) is 1.

So the figure of merit (FOM) for the fully connected network is number_of_links * worst_case_path_length. That would be [n(n-1)/2] * 1 = n(n-1)/2.

Now, moving on to the ring network. In a ring network, each processor is connected to exactly two others, forming a circular topology. So for n processors, the number of links is n. Because it's a ring, each node has two links, but the total is n since each link connects two nodes.

The worst-case path length here is a bit trickier. In a ring, the maximum distance between any two nodes is the ceiling of n/2. Because in a ring, you can go either clockwise or counter-clockwise, and the longer path would be half the ring. For even n, it's exactly n/2. So the worst-case path length is n/2.

So the FOM for the ring network is number_of_links * worst_case_path_length = n * (n/2) = n²/2.

Now, the question asks for the ratio of the FOM of the fully connected network to that of the ring network. So that's FOM_fully / FOM_ring.

Plugging in the values: [n(n-1)/2] / [n²/2] = [n(n-1)/2] * [2/(n²)] = [n(n-1) * 2] / [2n²] = [n(n-1)] / n².

Simplifying that, the 2s cancel out, and we can cancel one n from numerator and denominator: (n-1)/n.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check that math.

FOM_fully is n(n-1)/2. FOM_ring is n*(n/2) = n²/2.

So FOM_fully divided by FOM_ring is [n(n-1)/2] / [n²/2] = [n(n-1)/2] * [2/(n²)].

The 2s cancel, so we have [n(n-1)] / [n²] = (n-1)/n.

So the ratio is (n-1)/n. Looking at the options, option A is (n-1)/n. So the answer should be A.

Wait, but wait another thing. Let me make sure I didn't mix up the FOMs. The question says the ratio of the figure of merit for the fully connected to the ring. So FOM_fully / FOM_ring. My calculation gives (n-1)/n, which is option A. But wait, sometimes when I see ratios, I might have to think if it's the other way around. Let me confirm.

Yes, the question is (figure of merit for fully) compared to (that of the ring). So correct, it's (n-1)/n.

But I'm a bit confused because I thought in some cases the ring might have a better FOM. Wait, in terms of path length, the ring is worse, but the number of links is better. Let me think again about the FOMs.

Wait, for the ring network, the number of links is n, and the worst-case path is n/2 for even n. So FOM_ring = n * (n/2) = n²/2.

For the fully connected, number of links is n(n-1)/2, and path length is 1, so FOM is [n(n-1)/2] * 1 = n(n-1)/2.

So the ratio is (n(n-1)/2) / (n²/2) = (n(n-1)/2) * (2/n²) = (n-1)/n.

Yes, that's correct. So the ratio is (n-1)/n, which is option A.

The figure of merit (FOM) for the fully interconnected network is calculated as the number of links (n(n-1)/2) multiplied by the worst-case path length (1), giving FOM_fully = n(n-1)/2. For the ring network, the number of links is n, and the worst-case path length is n/2, resulting in FOM_ring = n²/2. The ratio of FOM_fully to FOM_ring is (n(n-1)/2) / (n²/2) = (n-1)/n.
