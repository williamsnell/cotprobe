When she went into Computer Retailer Inc., the salesperson also sold her a 5-year service agreement for $1,200 for a total price of $2,200. Nine months later, the laptop stopped working and Computer Retailer refused to perform on their service agreement. If Connie sues Computer Retailer, the trial court will likely find for

Options:

B: Connie, under the UCC only if the predominate reason for entering into the contract was for the goods portion of the contract.
C: Connie, under the UCC unless the predominate purpose of the agreement was for the service agreement portion of the contract.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this contract law question. Let me read through it again. 

Connie bought a laptop for $1,000 and also got a 5-year service agreement for $1,200, making the total $2,200. Nine months later, the laptop broke, and the retailer refused to honor the service agreement. She's suing them. The question is about which party the trial court will likely rule in favor of, and the options are A through D.

First, I remember that contract law can be either under the common law or the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC). The UCC applies to sales of goods, while common law applies to services or other types of contracts. 

So the main issue here is determining whether the contract is governed by the UCC or common law. The contract includes both the sale of a laptop (a good) and a service agreement. I think the key is to figure out the predominant purpose of the contract. 

I recall that if the predominant purpose is the sale of goods, then the UCC applies. But if it's more about the service, common law might take over. There's a test where if the goods are considered incidental to the service, then common law applies. 

In this case, Connie bought a laptop, which is a good, and a service agreement. The service agreement is $1,200, which is more than the laptop's price. But I'm not sure if the higher cost of the service automatically makes it the predominant purpose. I think it's more about the intent of the parties and the nature of the contract, not just the dollar amounts.

Looking at the options:

Option A says Connie under common law because the predominant purpose was the sale of goods. Wait, no, the UCC would apply if the predominant purpose is goods. So A doesn't make sense because it's saying common law applies when goods are predominant, which I think is the opposite.

Option B says Connie under UCC only if the predominant reason was the goods. So if the goods were the main reason, UCC applies. But if the service was predominant, maybe not. I'm not sure about this one.

Option C says Connie under UCC unless the predominant purpose was the service. So if the service was the main reason, then maybe common law applies, otherwise UCC. That sounds more accurate because if the main purpose is goods, UCC applies; if it's services, common law.

Option D says the court looks at intent, not dollar amounts. So if the main intent was for the service, then the retailer might win because the court might find the predominant purpose was service, hence common law, and the retailer isn't obligated under UCC.

Wait, but Connie is suing because the service agreement wasn't honored. If the contract is governed by the UCC, which deals with the sale of goods, but the service agreement is a separate part. Or is the entire contract considered a sale of goods with an added service?

I think that if the predominant purpose is the goods, UCC applies to that part. But if the service is a separate contract, then maybe it's governed by common law. Alternatively, the entire agreement might be seen as a mixed contract.

But I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The UCC applies to the sale of goods. The service agreement might be a separate contract. So the laptop sale is governed by UCC, and the service agreement by common law. But the question is about whether the entire contract is under UCC or common law.

If the service is so significant that it's the main reason for the contract, then the predominant purpose is service, so common law applies. The higher price of the service might indicate that it's more important.

So if the predominant purpose is the service, then the trial court would apply common law, which might not require the retailer to perform the service, or perhaps Connie can sue under common law for breach of contract. Wait, no—if the contract is for services, and the retailer breached the service agreement, Connie could sue under common law.

But the options are about whether the court finds for Connie. So if the contract is governed by UCC, then Connie can sue under UCC. If it's governed by common law, then she could still sue under that.

Wait, the question is about whether the court will find for Connie. So under which theory does she win.

If the predominant purpose is the sale of goods, then UCC applies, and Connie can sue for breach under UCC, probably finding in her favor because the retailer didn't honor the service, but wait—the service is part of the contract. Hmm, maybe not. Or perhaps the service is considered a separate contract.

Alternatively, the court might look at the predominant purpose. If the laptop was the main thing, UCC applies, and Connie can recover under that. If the service was the main thing, common law applies, and she can recover under that.

But the options are about which law applies. Let me look at the options again.

Option D says the court will determine the predominant purpose by intent, not dollars. So if the intent was for service, then the contract is under common law.

The question is about whether Connie can sue and win. So if the contract is under UCC, she can probably win because the retailer is supposed to provide the goods and services as part of the contract. Wait, but the UCC primarily deals with the sale of goods. The service agreement might be a separate part.

Wait, maybe the entire contract is a sale of goods with an extended warranty or service agreement. In that case, the UCC would apply to the sale of the laptop, and the service agreement might be governed by common law. But in such cases, the court might consider whether the service is part of the goods sale.

Alternatively, some jurisdictions might consider the entire transaction as a mixed contract, but the predominant purpose determines which law applies.

So if the predominant purpose is the laptop (goods), UCC applies, and the service agreement is part of that. But in this case, the service is more expensive. Does that mean it's predominant? Or does the nature of the contract matter more than the price?

I think the key is whether the service is considered incidental to the goods. If the service is the main reason for the contract, then it's predominant, and common law applies.

In this case, the service is $1,200 versus $1,000 for the laptop. So the service is more expensive. But that might not be the only factor. The intent of the parties also matters.

If the retailer provided a service agreement that's part of the laptop purchase, maybe the predominant purpose is the laptop. But if the service is the main thing, then it's different.

I think the answer hinges on whether the predominant purpose was the sale of goods or the service. If the service was the main reason, then the contract is under common law, and the retailer might not be obligated under the UCC. But Connie can sue under common law for breach of contract.

Wait, but the question is about whether the court will find for Connie. So if the contract is under UCC, she can sue for breach. If under common law, she can also sue, but the outcome might be different.

But the options are about which law applies, not the outcome. Let's look again.

Option C: Connie under UCC unless the predominant purpose was the service.

So, if the purpose is service, then common law applies, and Connie doesn't get UCC. But she could still have a claim under common law.

But the options are about the trial court likely finding for whom. So if the contract is under UCC, the retailer is bound by UCC terms, and if they breached, Connie can recover. If under common law, it's a different analysis.

Wait, but the question says that the retailer refused to perform on the service agreement. So the issue is whether the service agreement is enforceable.

If the contract is governed by UCC, then Connie can sue for breach of contract under UCC. If it's common law, she can also sue under common law. But the options are about which law applies.

So, if the predominant purpose is goods, UCC applies (option A says common law, which would be wrong). Option C says Connie under UCC unless service was predominant.

So the correct answer is likely C, because if the predominant purpose is the service, she doesn't fall under UCC. But the question is whether the court will find for Connie. So if the contract is under UCC, she would win. If under common law, she could still win depending on the breach.

Wait, but the options are about the basis for the court's decision. So the court would find for Connie under UCC unless the predominant purpose was the service. So option C is correct.

Alternatively, option D says the court determines by intent, not dollars, so if intent was service, then common law applies, and maybe the court would find for the retailer if the service was the predominant purpose.

Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The key is that when a contract involves both goods and services, the applicable law depends on the predominant purpose. If goods are predominant, UCC applies. If services, common law.

In this case, the service is more expensive. But the predominant purpose is determined by the nature of the contract, not just the price. So if the main reason for the contract was the service, then common law applies.

The question is, if Connie sues, what will the court find? If the court finds that the predominant purpose was the service, then the contract is under common law, and Connie can sue under that. But in that case, option D says the court will determine by intent, not dollars. So if the intent was for service, the court would apply common law, and perhaps find for Computer Retailer if they have a defense under common law.

But the options are about who the court will find for. So if the contract is under common law, and the retailer breached, Connie can still win under common law. But the options are about the basis of the ruling.

Looking back, the options are about whether the court finds for Connie under UCC or common law.

Option C: Connie under UCC unless predominant purpose was service.

So if the service was predominant, she doesn't get UCC. But she could still win under common law.

But the question is about which the court will find for. So if the contract is under UCC, the court would find for Connie. If under common law, the court would also find for Connie if she can prove breach under common law.

Wait, but the options are about which law applies, not the outcome. So the correct answer is about the applicable law.

So, if the predominant purpose is the sale of goods, UCC applies, and Connie wins under UCC. If the purpose is service, common law applies, and she can still win under that.

But the options are about the court's finding, i.e., on which basis they decide. So if the contract is governed by UCC, the court will apply that.

The question is about whether the court will find for Connie. So if the contract is under UCC, she can sue and win. If it's under common law, she can also sue and win.

But the options are about which law the court uses. So the correct option is C: Connie under UCC unless the predominant purpose was the service agreement.

Because if the service was the main reason, then UCC wouldn't apply, and the court would have to apply common law. But the question is whether the court would find for Connie, which they would under either law if there's a breach.

Wait, but the options are about the basis, not the outcome. So the correct answer is C.

The question revolves around determining the applicable law for the contract between Connie and Computer Retailer Inc. The contract includes both the sale of a laptop (a good) and a 5-year service agreement. The key issue is whether the contract is governed by the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) or common law, which depends on the predominant purpose of the contract.

Under contract law, if the predominant purpose of the contract is the sale of goods, the UCC applies. If the predominant purpose is a service, common law applies. The determination of predominant purpose considers the nature of the contract and the intent of the parties, not just the dollar amounts.

In this case, the service agreement costs more than the laptop, but the focus is on the intent and nature of the contract. If the predominant purpose is the sale of goods, the UCC applies, and Connie can sue under the UCC. If the predominant purpose is the service agreement, common law applies, and Connie can sue under that.

Option C states that Connie would be governed by the UCC unless the predominant purpose was the service agreement. This aligns with the principle that the UCC applies when the predominant purpose is the sale of goods. If the service was the main reason, common law would apply instead.

Thus, the correct answer is:

C: Connie, under the UCC unless the predominant purpose of the agreement was for the service agreement portion of the contract.
