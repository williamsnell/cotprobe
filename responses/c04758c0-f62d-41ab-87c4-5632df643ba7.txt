Okay, so I have this question about what Mill defines as "utility." I'm a bit rusty on my philosophy, but I remember that Mill is associated with utilitarianism. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I recall that utilitarianism is a theory in ethics that suggests the best action is the one that maximizes overall happiness or utility. So utility here would be about producing the most good or happiness. Now, the question is, how exactly does Mill define it?

Looking at the options, A says "advantage or benefit to the user." That sounds too individualistic. Mill's utilitarianism is more about the greater good for society as a whole, not just the user.

Option B is "usefulness for some craft." That seems more like a general definition of usefulness, maybe in a practical sense, but not specific to Mill's utilitarianism.

Option C is "the ability to satisfy wants and needs." This is a bit broader. While satisfying wants and needs can contribute to utility, I'm not sure if that's exactly how Mill frames it. He might focus more on the outcomes rather than the satisfaction of wants.

Option D is "usefulness to an individual." Again, this is too narrow. Mill's principle of utility is about the greatest good for the greatest number, so it's not just individual.

Option E says "it promotes the interests of all and does not harm anyone." That's a bit similar to a concept of altruism, but I'm not sure if that's exactly Mill's definition. It might be more about consequences rather than promoting interests without harm.

Option F is "it promotes self-interest." That's more aligned with egoism, which Mill doesn't support. Utilitarianism is about the common good, not self-interest.

Option G is "the state of being useful, profitable, or beneficial." This is a general definition, but I think Mill's view is more specific, focusing on the consequences in terms of happiness.

Option H is "pleasure and the absence of pain." That's part of it because Mill does emphasize happiness, which he equates with pleasure and absence of pain. But I think the term "utility" in his context refers more to the consequences that bring about this state.

Option I is "usefulness to society." This seems closer. Mill's principle is about the greatest happiness of the greatest number, which ties into societal good.

Option J is "it benefits the majority and harms the minority." This is a bit related to utilitarianism, but it's more about the application (the ends justifying the means) rather than the definition of utility itself.

So, putting it all together, Mill defines utility in terms of the consequences that bring about the greatest happiness. His definition is often phrased in terms of maximizing overall well-being. Looking back at the options, option H mentions pleasure and absence of pain, which aligns with how Mill defines happiness. But wait, the question is about how Mill defines "utility," not happiness. I think in Mill's Utilitarianism, utility refers to the principle that actions are right if they promote the greatest good for the greatest number. So, utility is about the consequences in terms of producing the most happiness.

Wait, but looking at the options again, option H is about pleasure and absence of pain, which is more about the content of happiness. Option I is about usefulness to society. So, which is it? I think Mill defines utility as the greatest good for the greatest number, which is a societal benefit. So, option I could be a fit, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, option H is about the result, not the definition of utility itself.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the definitions. Mill's definition of utility is the principle that the rightness of an action is determined by the consequences in terms of maximizing overall happiness. So, utility is the state where actions aim to produce the most happiness, which is defined as pleasure and absence of pain. So, perhaps option H is more about the definition of happiness, while utility is the broader principle.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck. Let me think again. Mill's "utilitarianism" is the doctrine that the right action is the one that maximizes utility, where utility is defined as the sum of happiness. So "utility" itself is the measure of happiness, which is pleasure minus pain. Therefore, the definition would be H: pleasure and the absence of pain.

Wait, but I'm not sure because I think utility is the principle, not the state. Alternatively, maybe option I is correct because utility is about what's useful to society. No, I think the key is that Mill defines utility as the consequences that bring about the greatest happiness. So, utility is the outcome that results in pleasure and absence of pain for the majority.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for Mill's definition of "utility" as a principle, which is the greatest happiness principle. So, the answer might be H because that's what defines happiness, which is the basis of utility.

Wait, another angle: Mill's definition in his "Principles of Political Economy" might describe utility in terms of the satisfaction of wants. But in his ethical theory, it's about maximizing happiness. So, perhaps the answer is H because that's the definition of happiness, which is what utility aims for.

Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is I, usefulness to society, because the principle is about society's good. But I'm not entirely sure. I think I need to decide between H and I.

Wait, in Mill's "Utilitarianism," he says, "the foundation of morals and of the mental constitution of man is the principle of utility, laid down in the beginning of this work—that the sole end for which human actions are or ought to be directed is the greatest happiness of the greatest number." So, the principle of utility is about the greatest happiness, which is defined as the sum of pleasures minus pains. Therefore, "utility" as a concept is about the state of being in terms of pleasure and absence of pain.

So, the answer would be H: pleasure and the absence of pain.

Mill defines "utility" as the principle that actions are right if they promote the greatest happiness for the greatest number. In his work, he equates happiness with "pleasure and the absence of pain." Therefore, the correct answer is:

H
