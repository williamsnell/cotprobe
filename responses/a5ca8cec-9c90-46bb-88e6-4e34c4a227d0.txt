Okay, so I've got this economics question about the market for denim jeans. Hmm, let's see. The question says that the market is in equilibrium, and then the price of polyester pants, which are a substitute good, rises. I need to figure out what happens in the jean market as a result.

First, I remember that substitute goods are alternatives to each other. So if the price of polyester pants goes up, people might switch to buying more denim jeans because they're now relatively cheaper. That should affect the demand for jeans, right?

When the price of a substitute good increases, the demand for the other good usually increases. So in this case, demand for jeans should go up. Now, if demand increases in a market that was previously in equilibrium, what happens?

I think when demand rises, the equilibrium price and quantity both increase. Because more people are buying jeans, so the price goes up, and the quantity sold also goes up. So the demand curve shifts to the right, leading to a higher price and higher quantity.

Looking at the options, I need to find which one says demand rises, leading to an increase in both price and quantity. Let me go through the options:

A: supply falls, increasing price and quantity. No, that's about supply, but we're talking about demand here.

B: demand rises, decreasing price and increasing quantity. Wait, if demand rises, price should increase, not decrease. So B might not be right.

C: demand rises, increasing price and decreasing quantity. No, that doesn't make sense because higher demand usually leads to higher quantity.

D: demand falls, decreasing price and increasing quantity. No, because the price of polyester went up, so demand for jeans should rise, not fall.

E: supply rises, decreasing price and increasing quantity. Not about demand.

F: demand rises, increasing price and increasing quantity. Yes, this seems right because demand goes up, leading to higher price and more quantity.

G: supply rises, increasing price and decreasing quantity. Not relevant.

H: supply falls, increasing price and decreasing quantity. No, again supply isn't the main issue here.

I: demand falls, increasing price and decreasing quantity. No, same as D.

J: supply falls, decreasing price and decreasing quantity. No.

So the correct answer should be F: demand rises, increasing the price and increasing the quantity.

The price of polyester pants, a substitute for denim jeans, rises, leading to an increase in demand for jeans. This shifts the demand curve to the right, resulting in a higher equilibrium price and quantity.

Answer: F
