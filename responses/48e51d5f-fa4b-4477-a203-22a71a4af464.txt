Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric toasters. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my electrical stuff, but let me think. The question is asking for the resistance of a toaster that uses 5 amperes when connected to a 120-volt circuit. Alright, I remember something about Ohm's Law from my classes. Oh right, Ohm's Law relates voltage, current, and resistance. The formula is V equals I times R, right? So V is voltage, I is current, and R is resistance.

Wait, the formula is V = I * R, and I need to find R. So if I rearrange that, R should be V divided by I. Yeah, that makes sense because if you have the voltage and the current, you can find the resistance by dividing voltage by current.

So let me plug in the numbers. The voltage here is 120 volts, and the current is 5 amperes. So R = 120 V / 5 A. Let me do that division. 120 divided by 5. Hmm, 5 times 24 is 120, so that should be 24 ohms. 

Wait, but let me double-check. Ohm's Law can sometimes be tricky. So V is 120, I is 5. So R is 120 /5 =24. Yeah, that's right. So looking at the options, option G is 24 ohms. So the answer should be G.

I don't think I made any mistakes here. The calculation seems straightforward. Maybe I should consider if the units are correct. Volts divided by amps gives ohms, which is correct. So yeah, I'm confident that the answer is G.

The resistance of the toaster can be found using Ohm's Law, which states \( V = I \times R \). Rearranging the formula gives \( R = \frac{V}{I} \). Substituting the given values, \( R = \frac{120 \, \text{V}}{5 \, \text{A}} = 24 \, \Omega \). 

Answer: G
