Okay, let's tackle this chemistry problem step by step. The question is about predicting the heat of vaporization for water at 373 K. Hmm, I remember that the heat of vaporization is the energy required to change a liquid into a gas. Wait, but in thermodynamics, sometimes these values are given with a negative sign because they're exothermic when condensing, right?

So, the problem gives two reactions:

1. H₂(g) + ½ O₂(g) → H₂O(g) with ΔH°₃₇₃ = -57.98 kcal/mol
2. H₂(g) + ½ O₂(g) → H₂O(liq) with ΔH°₃₇₃ = -67.68 kcal/mol

Wait a second, I think I'm remembering that the formation of liquid water is more exothermic than vapor. So, the reaction forming liquid water releases more heat than the one forming water vapor. That makes sense because liquid is more stable than gas, so it releases more energy.

So, to find the heat of vaporization, I need to find the energy difference between the two states. I think the heat of vaporization (ΔH_vap) is the energy required to go from liquid to gas. So, if I take the enthalpy of vaporization, it's the enthalpy of the gas minus the enthalpy of the liquid.

Let me write that out. The equation for vaporization would be H₂O(liq) → H₂O(g). The enthalpy change for this reaction would be the ΔH for the gas minus the ΔH for the liquid.

So, using the given data:

ΔH°(vaporization) = ΔH°(H₂O(g)) - ΔH°(H₂O(liq))

Plugging in the numbers:

ΔH°(vap) = (-57.98 kcal/mol) - (-67.68 kcal/mol) = (-57.98 + 67.68) kcal/mol = 9.7 kcal/mol.

Wait, that's 9.7 kcal per mole. But the options are in kilojoules, so I need to convert. I remember that 1 kcal is approximately 4.184 kJ. So, 9.7 kcal * 4.184 kJ/kcal.

Let me calculate that: 9.7 * 4.184 ≈ 40.48 kJ/mol. Hmm, looking at the options, option F is 40.59 kJ. That's pretty close. I must have made a slight rounding error somewhere. Let me check the multiplication again.

9.7 * 4.184:

Well, 10 *4.184=41.84, so 9.7 is 0.3 less. 0.3 *4.184=1.2552. So, 41.84 -1.2552=40.5848 kJ. Yep, that rounds to 40.58 kJ, which matches option F, 40.59 kJ. So the answer should be F.

The heat of vaporization is calculated by finding the difference in enthalpy between the liquid and gaseous states of water. Using the provided data:

ΔH°(vap) = ΔH°(H₂O(g)) - ΔH°(H₂O(liq))  
ΔH°(vap) = (-57.98 kcal/mol) - (-67.68 kcal/mol) = 9.7 kcal/mol.

Converting 9.7 kcal/mol to kJ/mol using 1 kcal ≈ 4.184 kJ:  
9.7 kcal/mol × 4.184 kJ/kcal ≈ 40.58 kJ/mol.

This matches option F, 40.59 kJ.

Answer: F
