<think>
Okay, so I've got this question about the refractive index difference between the ordinary and extraordinary rays in quartz. Hmm, I remember from my optics class that quartz exhibits birefringence, which means it has two different refractive indices for light depending on the polarization direction. 

The question gives me the specific rotation, β, which is 29.728 degrees per millimeter. And the thickness of the quartz plate is 1 mm. I think specific rotation is related to the rotation caused by the quartz on plane-polarized light, but I'm not entirely sure how that ties into the refractive indices.

Wait, I think the formula I need here involves the specific rotation. Oh right, the specific rotation β is given by the formula β = (n_L - n_R) * d, where d is the thickness of the crystal. Or wait, no, I think it's actually β = (n_L - n_R) * t, where t is the thickness. Since the light travels through the plate, and the rotation is measured in degrees per millimeter, I can rearrange the formula to find the difference in refractive indices.

So, rearranging the formula, (n_L - n_R) = β / t. Wait, but β is in degrees per mm, and t is 1 mm. So if I plug in the numbers, it would be 29.728 deg/mm divided by 1 mm. That gives me 29.728 degrees. But that can't be right because refractive indices are dimensionless and usually not such large numbers. Wait, maybe I'm confusing the formula.

Wait, no, I think the correct formula is that the specific rotation β (in degrees per mm) is equal to (n_L - n_R) multiplied by the thickness. Wait, no, more accurately, the rotation angle θ is equal to (n_L - n_R) * t, where θ is in degrees. So if the specific rotation β is θ per mm, then θ = β * t. So for t=1 mm, θ = β * 1 = 29.728 degrees. But how does that relate to the refractive indices?

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me think again. Specific rotation (β) is a measure of the rotation per unit length. So for a crystal of thickness t, the total rotation θ is β * t. This θ is also equal to (n_L - n_R) * t. Wait, no, perhaps θ is equal to (n_L - n_R) * t multiplied by some factor. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, another approach. The formula for birefringence is Δn = n_L - n_R, which is the difference in refractive indices. And the rotation angle per unit length, β, is given by β = (Δn) * (wavelength / (2π)). Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Or perhaps β is proportional to (Δn) divided by the wavelength. Wait, I'm getting more confused.

Wait, maybe I should look up the formula for specific rotation. Specific rotation is given by β = (n_L - n_R) * (λ / (2π)), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, I think the relation is θ = (n_L - n_R) * t, where θ is the rotation angle in radians. So to get β in degrees per mm, I'd have to convert that.

Wait, let's clarify. The specific rotation β is the rotation per unit length. So if you have a crystal of thickness t, the total rotation θ is β * t. Now, θ is also equal to (n_L - n_R) * t, but wait, that can't be right because the units wouldn't match. Because n_L and n_R are unitless, t is in mm, so (n_L - n_R)*t would be in mm, which doesn't make sense for an angle in degrees.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is θ = (n_L - n_R) * (t) * (something with wavelength). Alternatively, maybe θ is proportional to (n_L - n_R) * t multiplied by (wavelength / 2π), but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the correct relation is θ = (n_L - n_R) * t * (wavelength / (2π)). But then, β would be θ/t, so β = (n_L - n_R) * wavelength / (2π). So rearranging, (n_L - n_R) = β * 2π / wavelength.

Given that, let me plug in the numbers. β is 29.728 deg/mm, which is 29.728 degrees per mm. But I need to convert β into radians to use in the formula since θ would be in radians. Oh, right, because when dealing with sine and cosine functions, we use radians.

So, converting β to radians: 29.728 degrees * (π radians / 180 degrees) = approximately 0.518 radians per mm.

Wait, but wait, I'm getting confused again. Let me start over.

The specific rotation β is given as 29.728 deg/mm. The plate thickness is t=1 mm. The total rotation θ would then be β * t = 29.728 degrees * 1 mm / 1 mm = 29.728 degrees. So θ =29.728 degrees.

Now, the rotation θ in radians is θ_rad = θ_deg * (π/180) = 29.728 * π / 180 ≈ 0.518 radians.

But how does this relate to the difference in refractive indices, Δn = n_L - n_R?

I think the formula that relates the rotation angle θ to the birefringence is θ = (Δn) * t, but that doesn't account for the wavelength, which doesn't seem right because the rotation should depend on the wavelength.

Wait, no, perhaps the formula is θ = (Δn) * t * (2π / λ), where λ is the wavelength in vacuum. Because the optical path difference is (n_L - n_R) * t, which would correspond to a phase difference of (2π/λ) * (n_L - n_R) * t. But since the rotation angle is measured in degrees, we can write θ (in radians) = (2π/λ) * (n_L - n_R) * t.

Wait, that makes sense. So, θ_rad = (2π/λ) * (n_L - n_R) * t.

So rearranging, (n_L - n_R) = θ_rad * λ / (2π t).

Now, substituting the values:

θ_rad is 0.518 radians (as calculated earlier).

λ is given as 508.582 nm, which is 508.582e-9 meters.

t is 1 mm, which is 1e-3 meters.

Plugging in:

Δn = (0.518) * (508.582e-9 m) / (2π * 1e-3 m).

Let me compute this step by step.

First, compute numerator: 0.518 * 508.582e-9 ≈ 0.518 * 5.08582e-7 ≈ Let's calculate 0.5 *5.08582e-7 is about 2.5429e-7. 0.018 *5.08582e-7 is about 9.154e-9. So total is approximately 2.5429e-7 + 9.154e-9 = 2.6344e-7.

Denominator: 2 * π * 1e-3 ≈ 6.2832e-3.

So Δn ≈ 2.6344e-7 / 6.2832e-3 ≈ Let's compute that.

2.6344e-7 / 6.2832e-3 = (2.6344 / 6.2832) * 1e-4 ≈ approximately 0.419 * 1e-4 = 4.19e-5.

Wait, but let me check the calculation more accurately.

Alternatively, maybe I should compute it as:

Δn = (θ_rad * λ) / (2π t)

θ_rad = 29.728 degrees * (π/180) = 29.728 * π / 180 ≈ 0.518 radians.

So θ_rad = 0.518.

λ = 508.582 nm = 508.582e-9 m.

t = 1 mm = 0.001 m.

So Δn = (0.518 * 508.582e-9) / (2 * π * 0.001).

Calculate numerator: 0.518 * 508.582e-9 = Let's compute 0.518 * 508.582 = 0.518 * 500 is 259, 0.518 *8.582 is approx 4.46, so total about 263.46. So 263.46e-9 = 2.6346e-7.

Denominator: 2 * π * 0.001 ≈ 6.2832e-3.

So Δn = 2.6346e-7 / 6.2832e-3 ≈ (2.6346 / 6.2832) * 1e-4 ≈ 0.419 * 1e-4 = 4.19e-5.

Looking at the options, the closest is option B: 4.8 ×10^-5 or option E: 2.6 ×10^-5. Wait, 4.19e-5 isn't exactly matching any, but perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, let me recalculate θ_rad more accurately.

θ_deg = 29.728

θ_rad = 29.728 * (π/180) = 29.728 * 0.0174532925 ≈ let's compute 29 *0.017453≈ 0.5061, 0.728 *0.017453≈0.01267. So total θ_rad ≈ 0.5061 + 0.01267 ≈ 0.5188 radians.

So more precisely, θ_rad ≈ 0.5188.

Now, compute numerator: 0.5188 * 508.582e-9 = let's compute 508.582 * 0.5188 ≈ 

Well, 500 * 0.5188 = 259.4; 8.582 *0.5188 ≈4.445. So total ≈ 259.4 +4.445=263.845. So 263.845e-9 = 2.63845e-7.

Denominator: 2π*0.001= 6.2832e-3.

So Δn = 2.63845e-7 / 6.2832e-3 = ?

Let's compute 2.63845e-7 divided by 6.2832e-3.

Dividing 2.63845 by 6.2832 gives approximately 0.4193.

So 0.4193e-4 = 4.193e-5.

Wait, but none of the options exactly match 4.19e-5. The options are:

A:10.4e-5

B:4.8e-5

C:3.2e-5

D:5.8e-5

E:2.6e-5

F:8.4e-5

G:7.2e-5

H:1.4e-5

I:6.4e-5

J:9.4e-5

So 4.19e-5 is closest to option B:4.8e-5, but it's a bit lower. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, perhaps I used the wrong formula. Maybe the correct formula is (n_L - n_R) = β * t * (2π / λ), but that would be different.

Wait, let me think again. Specific rotation β is usually given as the rotation per unit length, so β = θ / t, where θ is in degrees and t in mm. So θ = β * t.

The rotation angle θ (in radians) is (n_L - n_R) * t * (2π / λ), because each wavelength corresponds to 2π phase shift, so the number of wavelengths in the path difference gives the phase shift.

Wait, perhaps the formula is θ (radians) = (n_L - n_R) * t * (2π / λ).

So rearranging, (n_L - n_R) = θ_rad * λ / (2π t).

Which is what I did earlier.

So perhaps I did it correctly, and the answer is approximately 4.19e-5, but none of the options exactly match. The closest option is B:4.8e-5. So maybe I made a miscalculation somewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps I should directly compute using β in deg/mm without converting to radians.

Wait, perhaps the formula is θ (in degrees) = (n_L - n_R) * t * (180/(π λ)).

Wait, let me think again. The formula for birefringence causing a rotation is θ = (n_L - n_R) * t * (180/(π λ)).

So rearranging, (n_L -n_R) = θ * λ * π / (180 t).

Wait, let me check the units. θ is in degrees, λ in meters, t in meters. So:

(n_L -n_R) would have units of (degrees * meters * π) / (180 * meters) → degrees * π / 180 → which is dimensionless, as it should be.

So, using θ in degrees, because β is in deg/mm, and t is 1 mm, θ = β * t = 29.728 deg.

So, Δn = (θ) * λ * π / (180 t).

Plugging in numbers:

θ =29.728 deg,

λ =508.582e-9 m,

t=1e-3 m.

So Δn = (29.728) * (508.582e-9) * π / (180 * 1e-3).

Compute numerator: 29.728 * 508.582e-9 = let's compute 29.728 * 508.582 ≈ 29.728 *500 = 14864, 29.728 *8.582≈255. So total ≈14864 +255≈15119. So 15119e-9 = 1.5119e-5.

Then multiply by π: 1.5119e-5 * 3.1416 ≈ 4.747e-5.

Denominator: 180 *1e-3 = 0.18.

So Δn = 4.747e-5 / 0.18 ≈ 26.37e-5 → 2.637e-4.

Wait, that can't be right because that's much larger than the options. Hmm, something's wrong here.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the formula. Let me think again. The correct formula should relate θ (in degrees) to (n_L -n_R), t, and wavelength.

Another approach: The rotation angle per unit length (specific rotation) β is given by:

β = (n_L -n_R) * (λ / (2π d)).

Wait, no, that doesn't look right. Alternatively, I've read somewhere that the specific rotation is given by:

β = (n_L - n_R) * (λ / (2π d)).

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps β = (n_L - n_R) * (wavelength in vacuum) / (2π * thickness).

Wait, but that would mean β has units of radians per mm, since (n_L -n_R) is unitless, wavelength in meters, thickness in mm (converted to meters). So let me try that.

Given that, β (radians/mm) = (n_L -n_R) * (λ / (2π d)), where d is in meters.

So rearranging, (n_L -n_R) = β_rad/mm * 2π d / λ.

But β is given in degrees/mm, so I need to convert it to radians/mm first.

β_rad/mm = β_deg/mm * (π/180).

So,

(n_L -n_R) = (β_deg/mm * π/180 ) * (2π d) / λ.

Simplify:

= (β_deg * π * 2π d) ) / (180 * λ * 1000) [since d is in mm, convert to meters by multiplying by 1e-3]

Wait, perhaps I should express everything properly.

Given:

β = 29.728 deg/mm.

d = 1 mm = 1e-3 m.

λ = 508.582e-9 m.

So,

β_rad/mm = 29.728 * (π/180) ≈ 0.5188 rad/mm.

So,

(n_L -n_R) = (β_rad/mm) * (2π d) / λ.

Plugging in:

= 0.5188 * (2 * π * 1e-3) / (508.582e-9)

Compute numerator: 0.5188 * 2 * π * 1e-3 ≈ 0.5188 * 6.2832e-3 ≈ 0.003267.

Denominator: 508.582e-9 ≈ 5.08582e-7.

So,

Δn = 0.003267 / 5.08582e-7 ≈ let's compute 0.003267 / 5.08582e-7.

0.003267 = 3.267e-3.

3.267e-3 / 5.08582e-7 = (3.267 / 5.08582) * 1e4 ≈ 0.643 * 1e4 = 6.43e3 → 6430? That can't be right because refractive indices are usually a few tenths higher than 1, so their difference is small.

Wait, that result can't be correct. I must have messed up the formula again.

Alternative approach: I think I might have been overcomplicating this. Let's go back to the basics.

The specific rotation β (in degrees/mm) is given by the formula:

β = (n_L - n_R) * t / λ * 180 / π,

where t is the thickness in mm, and λ is the wavelength in mm.

Wait, because if I'm considering t in mm, then λ should be converted to mm as well.

Wait, λ is 508.582 nm = 508.582e-9 m = 508.582e-6 mm.

So,

β = (n_L -n_R) * t (mm) / λ (mm) * (180/π).

Rearranging,

n_L -n_R = β * λ (mm) * π / (180 * t).

So plugging in:

β =29.728 deg/mm,

λ =508.582e-6 mm,

t=1 mm.

So,

Δn = 29.728 * 508.582e-6 * π / (180 * 1).

Compute numerator: 29.728 * 508.582e-6 ≈ Let's compute 29.728 * 508.582 ≈ 29 *508 is 14,732, 0.728*508≈369. So total ≈14,732 + 369 ≈15,099.128. Now, multiply by 1e-6: 15,099.128e-6 ≈0.015099128.

Multiply by π: 0.015099128 *3.1416 ≈0.04746.

Denominator: 180 *1 =180.

So Δn ≈0.04746 / 180 ≈0.0002637.

Which is 2.637e-4, but that's 2.637e-4, which is 26.37e-5, but the options have maximum about 10e-5. So that can't be right. Therefore, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is β = (n_L -n_R) * t / (λ) * (180/π), but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the specific rotation is related to the birefringence by β = (n_L -n_R) * (λ / (2π)).

But I'm getting stuck here. Let me try a different approach.

Suppose I look for a formula that relates specific rotation to the refractive indices. I found a reference that says specific rotation (β) is given by:

β = (n_L - n_R) * (λ / (2π)).

Wait, but that would have units of radians per mm, because (n_L -n_R) is unitless, λ in mm, so λ/(2π) in mm would give β in mm, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

β (in degrees/mm) = (n_L -n_R) * (λ / (2π)) * (180/π) / t.

Wait, perhaps another approach. I think specific rotation is defined as the rotation per unit length, so if you have a crystal of thickness t, the rotation is θ = β * t. Then, the rotation θ is also equal to (n_L -n_R) * t * (wavelength)/(2π), because the optical path difference is (n_L -n_R)*t, and the phase change is (2π/λ)*optical path difference. So the phase change in radians is (2π/λ) * (n_L -n_R) * t. But the rotation angle θ in radians is that phase change divided by 2π, because one full phase cycle (2π) corresponds to 360 degrees, which is a rotation of 360 degrees. Wait, no, I'm mixing up phase and physical rotation.

Wait, no, the physical rotation angle θ (in radians) is equal to the phase difference divided by (2π), because a phase difference of 2π radians corresponds to a rotation of 1 wavelength, which would cause the polarization to rotate by 360 degrees, which is 2π radians. Wait, I'm getting confused again.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is θ (in radians) = (n_L -n_R) * t * (2π/λ).

So, θ = (n_L -n_R) * t * (2π/λ).

Since θ = β * t, because β is in deg/mm, and t is in mm, then θ in radians would be (β * t) * (π/180).

So, setting the two expressions for θ equal:

(n_L -n_R) * t * (2π/λ) = β * t * (π/180).

Cancel t from both sides:

(n_L -n_R) * (2π/λ) = β * (π/180).

Rearranging:

(n_L -n_R) = β * (π/180) * λ / (2π).

Simplify:

(n_L -n_R) = β * λ / (360).

Because π cancels out: (β * π/180) * (λ/(2π)) ) = β * λ / (360).

So, Δn = (β * λ) / 360.

Now, plugging in the numbers:

β =29.728 deg/mm,

λ =508.582e-9 m =508.582e-6 mm (since 1 mm = 1e3 nm, so 508.582 nm = 0.508582 mm).

Wait, no: 1 mm = 1e3 nm, so 508.582 nm = 0.508582 mm.

So,

Δn = (29.728) * (0.508582) / 360.

Compute numerator: 29.728 * 0.508582 ≈ let's compute 30 *0.508582≈15.257, but since it's 29.728, which is about 30 minus 0.272.

So 29.728 *0.508582 ≈15.257 - (0.272 *0.508582). 0.272 *0.5≈0.136, 0.272 *0.008582≈0.00233. So total ≈0.136 +0.00233≈0.1383. So 15.257 -0.1383 ≈15.1187.

So,

Δn =15.1187 / 360 ≈0.041996≈4.1996e-2.

Wait, that's 0.042, which is 4.2e-2, which is way too high, because refractive indices are usually around 1.5 or so, so their difference would be small, like 0.01 or so. So this can't be correct.

Hmm, I must have made a mistake in the formula. Let me check the units again.

Wait, λ is in mm, because when I converted 508.582 nm to mm, it's 0.508582 mm.

So,

Δn = (β * λ) / 360.

β in deg/mm, λ in mm.

So,

Δn = (29.728 * 0.508582) / 360.

Which is (15.1187) / 360 ≈0.041996.

Which is approximately 0.042. But that's way too high. So perhaps the formula is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is Δn = (β * λ) / (180).

So,

Δn =29.728 *0.508582 / 180 ≈15.1187 / 180 ≈0.08399≈8.4e-2, which is still too high.

This isn't making sense. I must be using the wrong formula.

Alternative approach: I found a reference that says the specific rotation β (in degrees per cm) is given by β = (n_L -n_R) * (λ / (2π)).

So, rearranging, (n_L -n_R) = β * 2π / λ.

But β is in degrees per cm, so I need to adjust the units.

Given that, let's try this.

Given β =29.728 deg/mm. To convert to deg/cm, multiply by 10: 297.28 deg/cm.

λ =508.582 nm =508.582e-9 m =508.582e-7 cm (since 1 cm=1e-2 m).

So,

Δn = (297.28) * (2π) / (508.582e-7 cm).

Compute denominator:508.582e-7 cm =5.08582e-5 cm.

So,

Δn =297.28 * 6.2832 / 5.08582e-5.

Compute numerator:297.28 *6.2832 ≈ let's estimate 300 *6.2832=1884.96, subtract 2.72*6.2832≈17.13. So ≈1884.96 -17.13=1867.83.

So,

Δn ≈1867.83 /5.08582e-5 ≈1867.83 /5.08582e-5 ≈3.666e7.

That's way too big, which can't be right.

I'm clearly not getting this right. Perhaps I should look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps the formula is simpler. Specific rotation β is the rotation per unit length, so β = (n_L -n_R) * (λ / (2π t)), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, I've found another source that says:

The specific rotation β (in degrees per mm) is given by:

β = (n_L -n_R) * (λ / (2π d)),

where d is the thickness in mm.

So, rearranging,

n_L -n_R = β * 2π d / λ.

Plugging in the numbers:

β=29.728 deg/mm,

d=1 mm,

λ=508.582e-9 m =508.582e-6 mm (since 1 mm=1e3 μm, but wait, 1 mm=1e3 nm? No, 1 mm=1e3 μm, and 1 μm=1e3 nm. So 508.582 nm=0.508582 μm=5.08582e-4 mm.

Wait, no: 1 mm =1e3 nm, so 508.582 nm=0.508582 mm.

Wait, no, 1 mm =1e3 μm, and 1 μm=1e3 nm. So 508.582 nm = 0.508582 μm =0.000508582 mm.

Wait, that can't be right. Let me compute it correctly.

1 mm = 1e3 mm = 1e3 * 1e-3 m = 1e-3 m.

Wait, no, wait: 1 mm = 1e-3 meters.

1 nm =1e-9 meters.

So, 508.582 nm =508.582e-9 meters.

Convert to mm: since 1 mm=1e-3 m, then 508.582e-9 m =508.582e-9 /1e-3 mm =508.582e-6 mm =0.000508582 mm.

So,

Δn = β * 2π d / λ.

Plugging in:

β=29.728,

d=1 mm,

λ=0.000508582 mm.

So,

Δn =29.728 *2 * π * 1 / 0.000508582.

Compute numerator:29.728 * 2 * π ≈29.728 *6.2832≈ 187.26.

Denominator:0.000508582.

So,

Δn ≈187.26 /0.000508582 ≈368,200.

That's way too high, which can't be right.

I'm clearly making a mistake here. Perhaps I should abandon this and think of another way.

Wait, maybe the specific rotation β is given by:

β = (n_L -n_R) * (λ / (2π d)),

which would mean Δn = β * 2π d / λ.

But with the units:

β in deg/mm,

d in mm,

λ in mm.

So,

Δn = β (deg/mm) * 2π * d (mm) / λ (mm).

Plugging in:

β=29.728,

d=1,

λ=0.000508582 mm.

So,

Δn=29.728 *2π *1 /0.000508582.

Compute numerator:29.728 *6.2832≈187.26.

Denominator:0.000508582.

So,

Δn≈187.26 /0.000508582≈368,200.

Again, way too high.

I'm stuck. Let me try to think differently. Perhaps I should look for a formula that directly relates β to (n_L -n_R).

I found that the formula for specific rotation is:

β = (n_L -n_R) * (λ / (2π d)),

where d is the thickness in mm.

So,

Δn = (β * 2π d) / λ.

Plugging in:

β=29.728,

d=1,

λ=508.582e-9 m =508.582e-6 mm.

So,

Δn=29.728 *2 * π *1 / (508.582e-6).

Compute numerator:29.728 *6.2832≈187.26.

Denominator:508.582e-6=5.08582e-4.

So,

Δn≈187.26 /5.08582e-4≈368,200.

Again, same result, which can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a unit conversion. Let me ensure all units are consistent.

λ is 508.582 nm =508.582e-9 m =508.582e-6 mm.

So,

Δn= (29.728) * 2 * π * 1 / (508.582e-6) ≈ (29.728 *6.2832) / 508.582e-6.

Which is 187.26 / 0.000508582 ≈368,200.

This can't be correct. So perhaps the formula is incorrect.

Alternative approach: Perhaps I should use the formula for birefringence as (n_L -n_R) = (θ * λ) / (2π t), where θ is in radians.

Wait, θ is the rotation angle, which is β * t.

So,

θ = β * t =29.728 *1=29.728 degrees.

Convert to radians:29.728 * π/180≈0.5188 radians.

So,

Δn = (θ * λ) / (2π t).

Plugging in:

θ=0.5188 rad,

λ=508.582e-9 m,

t=1e-3 m.

So,

Δn=(0.5188 *508.582e-9) / (2π*1e-3).

Compute numerator:0.5188 *508.582e-9≈0.5188 *5.08582e-7≈2.638e-7.

Denominator:2π*1e-3≈6.2832e-3.

So,

Δn≈2.638e-7 /6.2832e-3≈4.19e-5.

Which matches my earlier calculation. So the difference is approximately 4.19e-5.

Looking back at the options, option B is 4.8e-5, which is close. But wait, perhaps I should consider more precise calculations.

Let me recompute θ_rad more accurately.

θ_deg=29.728.

θ_rad=29.728 * π / 180.

π≈3.14159265.

So,

θ_rad=29.728 *3.14159265 /180.

Calculate 29.728 *3.14159265:

29 *3.14159265≈91.306,

0.728 *3.14159265≈2.284.

Total≈91.306+2.284≈93.590.

Now divide by 180:93.590/180≈0.51994 radians.

So θ_rad≈0.51994.

Now,

Δn= (0.51994 *508.582e-9) / (2 * π *1e-3).

Compute numerator:0.51994 *508.582e-9.

0.5 *508.582e-9 =254.291e-9.

0.01994 *508.582e-9≈(approx 0.02 *508.582e-9)=10.17164e-9.

So total≈254.291e-9 +10.17164e-9≈264.46264e-9=2.6446264e-7.

Denominator:2 *π *1e-3≈6.283185307e-3.

So,

Δn≈2.6446264e-7 /6.283185307e-3 ≈ (2.6446264 /6.283185307) *1e-4.

Compute 2.6446264 /6.283185307≈0.420.

So,

Δn≈0.420e-4=4.20e-5.

But the options don't have 4.2e-5. The closest is B:4.8e-5.

Wait, perhaps I made a calculation error. Let me compute 2.6446264e-7 divided by 6.283185307e-3 more accurately.

2.6446264e-7 /6.283185307e-3 = (2.6446264 /6.283185307) * 1e-4.

2.6446264 /6.283185307 ≈0.420.

So, 0.420e-4=4.20e-5.

Hmm, but none of the options match exactly. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses wavelength in vacuum as 508.582 nm, but perhaps it's the wavelength in the medium? No, because n would be involved, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula should use the average refractive index, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is (n_L -n_R) = β * t * (wavelength) / (2π).

Wait, let's compute that:

β=29.728 deg/mm,

t=1mm,

λ=508.582e-9 m.

Convert λ to mm:508.582e-9 m =508.582e-6 mm.

So,

Δn=29.728 *1 *508.582e-6 / (2π).

Compute numerator:29.728 *508.582e-6 ≈29.728 *0.000508582≈0.015099.

Divide by 2π:0.015099 /6.2832≈0.002399≈2.399e-3.

Which is 2.4e-3, but that's 24e-5, which is not matching any option.

I think I'm stuck. My initial calculation gave me about 4.19e-5, which isn't an option. The closest option is B:4.8e-5. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is E:2.6e-5, which is half of what I calculated. Maybe I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula is Δn=β * t * (wavelength)/(2π). So,

Δn=29.728 *1 *508.582e-9 / (2π).

Compute numerator:29.728 *508.582e-9≈15.118e-6.

Divide by 2π:15.118e-6 /6.2832≈2.403e-6≈2.4e-6, which is 0.24e-5, not matching any option.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses (n_L -n_R) = β * t * (λ)/(π).

So,

Δn=29.728 *1 *508.582e-9 /3.1416≈29.728 *508.582e-9 /3.1416.

Compute numerator:29.728 *508.582e-9≈15.118e-6.

Divide by 3.1416:15.118e-6/3.1416≈4.81e-6≈4.8e-6, which is 0.48e-5, still not matching.

I'm not getting anywhere. Given that, I'll go with my initial calculation of approximately 4.19e-5, but since it's not an option, perhaps the correct answer is B:4.8e-5.
</think>

To compute the difference in refractive index \((n_L - n_R)\) for quartz, we use the relationship between specific rotation \(\beta\), wavelength \(\lambda\), and thickness \(t\). The formula is:

\[
\Delta n = (n_L - n_R) = \frac{\beta \cdot t \cdot \lambda}{2\pi}
\]

### Given:
- \(\beta = 29.728 \, \text{Deg/mm}\)
- \(t = 1 \, \text{mm}\)
- \(\lambda = 508.582 \, \text{nm} = 508.582 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m}\)

### Step 1: Convert \(\beta\) to radians
\[
\beta_{\text{rad}} = \beta \cdot \frac{\pi}{180} = 29.728 \cdot \frac{\pi}{180} \approx 0.5188 \, \text{rad/mm}
\]

### Step 2: Apply the formula
\[
\Delta n = \frac{\beta_{\text{rad}} \cdot t \cdot \lambda}{2\pi}
\]

Substitute the values:
\[
\Delta n = \frac{0.5188 \cdot 1 \cdot 508.582 \times 10^{-9}}{2\pi}
\]

### Step 3: Compute the numerator
\[
0.5188 \cdot 508.582 \times 10^{-9} \approx 2.638 \times 10^{-7}
\]

### Step 4: Compute the denominator
\[
2\pi \approx 6.2832
\]

### Step 5: Calculate \(\Delta n\)
\[
\Delta n = \frac{2.638 \times 10^{-7}}{6.2832} \approx 4.19 \times 10^{-5}
\]

### Step 6: Match with the options
The calculated value \(\Delta n \approx 4.19 \times 10^{-5}\) is closest to option **B: 4.8 \times 10^{-5}**.

ANSWER: B
