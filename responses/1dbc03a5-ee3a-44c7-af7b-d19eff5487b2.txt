Question:

There are two highly inbred strains of laboratory mice whose adult body weights are very different. Assume that the mouse's body weight is under the control of three pairs of contrasting genes: A vs. a, B vs. b and D vs. d. Assume further that each capital letter gene is responsible for contributing 5.0 grams to the total body weight, and that lowercase letters contribute 2.5 grams to total body weight. The average weight of mice in Strain I is 30 grams, while that of Strain II mice is 15 grams. (a) What are the most likely genotypes of these two strains? (b) Suppose Strain I and Strain II are crossed. What will be the phenotype of the F_1 progeny?

Options:

A: Strain I: AABB DD, Strain II: aabb dd, F_1 progeny: 20g
B: Strain I: AAbb DD, Strain II: aaBB dd, F_1 progeny: 25g

Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here about mouse body weight and inbred strains. Let me try to work through it step by step.

Alright, the problem says there are two inbred mouse strains, I and II. Their average weights are 30g and 15g respectively. The body weight is controlled by three gene pairs: A vs a, B vs b, and D vs d. Each capital letter gene contributes 5g, and lowercase contributes 2.5g. 

So, each gene pair is either AA, Aa, aa, etc. But since the mice are highly inbred, I think that means they're homozygous, right? So their genotype for each gene is either AA or aa, or BB or bb, etc. Because inbreeding leads to homozygosity.

The total weight comes from the sum of each gene's contribution. So for each gene, if it's a capital letter, it adds 5g; lowercase adds 2.5g. Since there are three genes, each contributing, the total weight is the sum of all three.

Strain I has 30g. Let's think: how many capital letters do they have? Each capital adds 5g, lowercase 2.5. Let me calculate how many capitals each strain would have.

Strain I: 30g. Let's find how many 5g and 2.5g units add up to 30. Let me think: each gene contributes either 5 or 2.5, so three genes would add up to between 7.5g (all lowercase) and 15g (all capitals). Wait, but 30g is way higher than that. Hmm, wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, no, each gene's effect is additive. So for each gene, it's either 5 or 2.5. So three genes would contribute up to 3*5=15g. But the mouse's weight is 30g. That doesn't make sense. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Oh wait, perhaps each gene pair's effect is cumulative across the three genes. So for each gene, the contribution is 5 if dominant (A, B, D) or 2.5 if recessive (a, b, d). So for each gene, it's either 5 or 2.5, and the total is the sum of all three.

Wait, but that would mean the maximum possible is 3*5=15g, but Strain I is 30g. That's a problem. So maybe each gene contributes 5g per allele, so for each gene, two alleles: if both are dominant (like AA), it's 5*2=10g? Or perhaps each gene contributes 5g per dominant allele. So Aa would be 5 + 2.5 =7.5g for that gene. Wait, but the problem states each capital letter contributes 5g, lowercase 2.5g. So for each gene, the total is either 5+5=10 (if AA), 5+2.5=7.5 (if Aa), or 2.5+2.5=5 (if aa). Or wait, does each allele contribute, so each gene has two alleles, each contributing their value. So for AA, it's 5+5=10; Aa is 5+2.5=7.5; aa is 2.5+2.5=5.

Wait, that makes more sense. Because then, for each of the three genes, their contribution adds up. So for each gene, the possible contributions are 10 (AA), 7.5 (Aa), or 5 (aa). But since the mice are inbred, they must be homozygous, so each gene is either AA (10g) or aa (5g). So for each gene, either 10 or 5.

So total weight would be sum of three genes, each contributing 10 or 5. So for three genes, the maximum possible is 30g (10*3), and the minimum is 15g (5*3). 

Strain I is 30g, so all three genes must be AA (10 each) for all three genes. So their genotype would be AABB DD, because each gene is AA, BB, DD. Wait, no: each gene is separate. So for each gene pair (A/a, B/b, D/d), they'd be AA, BB, DD. So genotype AABB DD? Wait, but each is a separate gene; so genotype would be AABB DD, but that's for all three. So Strain I genotype is AABB DD (assuming each gene is homozygous dominant).

Strain II is 15g, which is the minimum. So each gene is aa, so genotype is aabb dd.

Wait, but the problem says each gene contributes 5g per dominant allele. Wait, maybe I misinterpreted earlier. Let me read the problem again.

Problem statement: Each capital letter gene contributes 5g, lowercase 2.5g. So for each gene, if it's AA, each A contributes 5g, so 5+5=10g per gene. If Aa, 5 + 2.5 =7.5g. If aa, 2.5 + 2.5=5g.

So each gene's contribution is 10, 7.5, or 5. But since the mice are inbred, each gene is homozygous, so each gene contributes either 10 or 5g.

So Strain I has 30g total, which is 10 *3 =30. So each of the three genes is AA (10g each). So Strain I is AABB DD (for each gene). Wait, but that's combining all three genes into one genotype. Actually, each gene is independent, so the genotype would be AA for A/a, BB for B/b, and DD for D/d. So the genotype is AABB DD (but written as three separate homozygous genes). Alternatively, the genotype would be AA BB DD, but I think the correct way is to write each gene's genotype. So I think the correct genotype for Strain I is AABB DD (assuming that each gene is AA, BB, DD).

Strain II has 15g, which is 5 *3 =15, so each gene is aa (5g each). So genotype is aabb dd.

So looking at the options, let's check which option has Strain I as AABB DD and Strain II as aabb dd. Option A says Strain I: AABB DD, Strain II: aabb dd, F1:20g. Let's check.

Now, part (a) is asking for the most likely genotypes, so that's option A's first two parts. But let's look at the F1 progeny.

When you cross Strain I (AABB DD) with Strain II (aabb dd), each gene is crossed. Since each is homozygous, the F1 will get one allele from each parent. For each gene, the F1 will be Aa for A/a (since AABB gives A, aabb gives a), Bb for B/b (BB x bb gives Bb), and Dd for D/d (DD x dd gives Dd).

Each gene in F1 is Aa, Bb, Dd. So for each gene, the contribution is 5 +2.5 =7.5g. Since there are three genes, each contributing 7.5g, total is 3 *7.5=22.5g.

Wait, but option A says F1 is 20g, which would be if each gene contributes 5g, but that's not the case. Hmm, so option A's F1 is 20g, which doesn't match. Let me check the options again.

Looking at option J: Strain I: AA bb DD, Strain II: aabb dd, F1:25g. Hmm, but Strain I's genotype is AA bb DD, which would mean for A/a, they're AA (10g), B/b they're bb (5g), D/d they're DD (10g). So their total is 10+5+10=25g. But Strain I's weight is supposed to be 30g, so this can't be right. So option J's Strain I is 25g, which doesn't match the given 30g. So J is incorrect.

Option C: Strain I: AA BB DD (so 10 each, total 30g), Strain II: aabb dd (so 5 each, total 15g). F1 would be Aa Bb Dd. Each gene contributes 7.5g, so 3 *7.5=22.5g. So F1 is 22.5g. So option C's F1 is 22.5g, which matches. So option C's answer for F1 is 22.5g.

But looking at the options, let's see which option has Strain I as AA BB DD and Strain II as aabb dd. Option C says Strain I: AA BB DD, Strain II: aabb dd, F1:22.5g. That would be correct.

Wait, but in the initial thought, I thought option A matched the genotypes but not the F1. But option C's F1 is 22.5g, which is correct, and the genotypes are correct. So option C is correct.

Wait, but looking at the options again, option C says F_1 progeny:22.5g. So that's correct. So part (a) would be Strain I: AA BB DD, Strain II: aabb dd, and part (b) F1 is 22.5g.

But looking at the options, the answer would be option C. But let me check all options again.

Option A: Strain I: AABB DD, Strain II: aabb dd, F1:20g. As I calculated, F1 should be 22.5g, so A is wrong.

Option C: F1 is 22.5g, which is correct. So option C is the correct choice.

The problem involves two inbred mouse strains with body weights of 30g (Strain I) and 15g (Strain II). Body weight is determined by three gene pairs (A/a, B/b, D/d), where each capital letter allele contributes 5g and each lowercase allele contributes 2.5g. Since the mice are inbred, they are homozygous for each gene.

For Strain I (30g), the maximum contribution per gene is 10g (AA, BB, or DD). Thus, Strain I must have the genotype **AA BB DD**, contributing 10g per gene, totaling 30g.

For Strain II (15g), the minimum contribution per gene is 5g (aa, bb, or dd). Thus, Strain II must have the genotype **aa bb dd**, contributing 5g per gene, totaling 15g.

When crossing Strain I (AA BB DD) with Strain II (aa bb dd), the F₁ progeny will inherit one allele from each parent for each gene. This results in the genotype **Aa Bb Dd** for the F₁. Each gene contributes 7.5g (5g from the capital allele and 2.5g from the lowercase allele), and the total weight is the sum of contributions from all three genes:  
\[
3 \times 7.5 = 22.5 \, \text{g}.
\]

Among the options, **Option C** correctly identifies the genotypes of Strain I and Strain II as **AA BB DD** and **aa bb dd**, respectively, and the F₁ progeny as **22.5g**.
