Okay, so I've got this problem about a soft drink dispenser. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

The question says the dispenser can deliver a fixed number of ounces, but there's a standard deviation in delivery of 0.3 ounces. They're asking what the mean setting should be so that a 12-ounce cup will overflow less than 1% of the time. And they assume the distribution is normal.

Hmm, so I'm thinking about what "overflow less than 1% of the time" means. I guess that means that only 1% of the time, the dispenser will deliver more than 12 ounces. So, I need to set the mean so that the probability of delivering more than 12 ounces is less than 1%.

In terms of probability, that would mean P(X > 12) < 0.01, where X is the ounces delivered. Since the distribution is normal, I can use z-scores to find the corresponding mean.

Wait, but normally, when we set a value such that a certain percentage is beyond it, we use the z-score that corresponds to that tail. So for 1%, which is a small probability in the upper tail, I need the z-score that leaves 1% in the right tail. I remember that the z-score for 99% confidence (which leaves 1% in the upper tail) is around 2.326. Because, like, the 99th percentile is where 99% of the data is below, so 1% is above.

So the formula I think I need is: μ + z * σ = 12 ounces. Wait, no, that's the other way. Wait, because if the mean is set higher, the probability of exceeding 12 would increase. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again.

Actually, the machine's mean setting is μ. The standard deviation σ is 0.3. We want P(X > 12) = 0.01. So, converting 12 ounces to a z-score: z = (12 - μ) / σ. Because X is normally distributed as X ~ N(μ, σ²), so Z = (X - μ)/σ.

We want P(Z > z) = 0.01. So the z-score corresponding to 0.01 in the upper tail is 2.326. Because the standard normal distribution table tells me that P(Z > 2.326) ≈ 0.01.

So setting up the equation: (12 - μ)/σ = 2.326. Wait, no, wait. Because if we have P(X > 12) = 0.01, then the z-score for X=12 is such that the probability beyond it is 0.01. So Z = (12 - μ)/σ = -2.326? Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the direction.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of: We want the 99th percentile of X to be 12. So, P(X ≤ 12) = 0.99, which means the z-score is 2.326. So,

Z = (12 - μ)/σ = 2.326.

Wait, no, wait. If P(X ≤ 12) = 0.99, then 12 is the 99th percentile. So, (12 - μ)/σ = 2.326.

Wait, but solving for μ, we get 12 - μ = 2.326 * σ, so μ = 12 - 2.326 * 0.3.

Wait, that would make μ less than 12. But wait, that can't be right because if the mean is below 12, then the probability of exceeding 12 would be less than 0.5, which is way more than 0.01. Wait, that's conflicting.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the direction. Let me think again.

We want P(X > 12) < 0.01. So the area to the right of 12 is 0.01, which means 12 is at the 99th percentile. So, the z-score for 12 is such that Z = (12 - μ)/σ = 2.326.

Wait, no, wait. Because if 12 is at the 99th percentile, then the z-score is positive 2.326. So,

(12 - μ)/0.3 = 2.326.

Wait, solving for μ:

12 - μ = 2.326 * 0.3

μ = 12 - (2.326 * 0.3)

Wait, that would make μ less than 12, which as I thought earlier, would mean that the machine's mean is below 12, so the probability of it delivering more than 12 would be about 1%—which is correct. Because if the mean is lower, the upper tail beyond 12 would be smaller.

Wait, but wait, let me confirm. Let's say μ is 12 - (2.326 * 0.3). So, 2.326 * 0.3 is approximately 0.6978. So μ ≈ 12 - 0.6978 ≈ 11.3022 ounces.

But wait, if μ is 11.3022, then the probability that X >12 is 0.01. So that would mean that 1% of the time, the dispenser delivers over 12 ounces, which would cause the cup to overflow. So that's what we want.

But looking at the options, let's see which one matches μ = 12 - 2.326*0.3. So that's 12 minus 2.326 times 0.3. Looking at the options:

Option H is 12 - 2.576*(0.3), which is too high a z-score. Option J is 12 - 2.326*(0.3). That's exactly what I have here. So the mean should be set at 12 - 2.326*0.3 ounces, which is option J.

Wait, but wait, let me check again. Because sometimes the z-score for 0.01 is 2.326, but sometimes people get confused whether it's a one-tailed or two-tailed test. But in this case, it's a one-tailed test because we're only concerned with the upper tail (overflow). So yes, 2.326 is correct.

Alternatively, maybe I should have set up the equation differently. Let me see: if we want P(X >12) = 0.01, then the z-score for 12 is (12 - μ)/σ = z, where z is the value such that P(Z > z) = 0.01. So z = 2.326. So,

(12 - μ)/0.3 = 2.326

12 - μ = 2.326 *0.3

μ = 12 - (2.326 *0.3) → which is option J.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought the mean should be higher than 12 to reduce the overflow, but that's not the case here. Wait, no, because if the mean is higher, the probability of delivering over 12 would be higher, right? So to have only 1% of the time exceeding 12, the mean should be lower than 12. Because if the mean is lower, the distribution is centered below 12, so the upper tail beyond 12 is smaller.

Yes, that makes sense. So, the correct answer is option J: 12 - 2.326*(0.3) ounces.
</think>

To determine the mean setting for the soft drink dispenser, we need to ensure that the probability of delivering more than 12 ounces (overflowing the cup) is less than 1%. Given that the standard deviation is 0.3 ounces and the distribution is normal, we use the z-score corresponding to the 99th percentile, which is 2.326. 

The formula to find the mean (μ) is:

\[
(12 - \mu) / 0.3 = 2.326
\]

Solving for μ:

\[
\mu = 12 - (2.326 \times 0.3)
\]

This corresponds to option J: \(12 - 2.326(0.3)\) ounces.
