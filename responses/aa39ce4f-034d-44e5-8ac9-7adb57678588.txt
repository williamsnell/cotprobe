Question:

Young Tina had never seen the space shuttle until her parents pointed out a picture of it ready to launch. When she next saw a picture of it flying, she had difficulty recognizing it. Which concept best explains this problem?

Options:

A: dishabituation
B: sensory adaptation
C: perceptual adaptation
D: summation
E: perceptual set
F: sensory interaction
G: binocular cue
H: depth perception
I: shape constancy
J: autokinetic effect

Okay, let me try to figure out this question. So, the scenario is about Young Tina who couldn't recognize the space shuttle in a picture when it was flying because she only saw it before when it was ready to launch. The question is asking which concept explains why she had difficulty recognizing it.

First, I need to understand each of the options given. Let's go through them one by one.

Option A: Dishabituation. I remember that dishabituation is when an organism stops responding to a stimulus after repeated exposure. But wait, in this case, Tina saw the shuttle once before, so maybe it's not about habituation here. Plus, she didn't recognize it the next time, which might not be about getting used to it.

Option B: Sensory adaptation. This is when our senses adjust to constant stimulation, making us less sensitive over time. For example, if you wear a shirt with an itchy tag, you stop feeling it after a while. But in this case, Tina saw the shuttle twice, but in different contexts. Maybe she didn't adapt to the movement? Not sure yet.

Option C: Perceptual adaptation. Hmm, this is about how our perceptions change when the environment changes. So, maybe she saw the shuttle in a static position (ready to launch) and then in motion (flying). Her brain might have adapted to the static image, making it harder to recognize when it's moving. That sounds plausible.

Option D: Summation. This is about the accumulation of stimuli over time, leading to a response. I don't think that's relevant here because the question isn't about the total amount of stimulation but about recognition difficulty.

Option E: Perceptual set. This refers to a person's predisposition to perceive things in a certain way based on past experiences. So, if Tina is used to seeing the shuttle in one position, she might have a perceptual set that makes it hard to recognize it in another. That could fit.

Option F: Sensory interaction. This is when one sense affects another, like how sound can influence what you see. Not sure how that applies here.

Option G: Binocular cue. That's related to depth perception using both eyes. The shuttle's appearance might not change much with depth cues, so maybe not.

Option H: Depth perception. This is about judging distance. Again, not directly related to recognizing the shuttle in different positions.

Option I: Shape constancy. This is the ability to recognize an object as the same shape regardless of the angle or perspective. So, if the shuttle changes shape when viewed from another angle, she might not recognize it. Wait, but the shuttle's shape doesn't change; it's the orientation. So maybe shape constancy isn't the issue here.

Option J: Autokinetic effect. This is when a stationary light appears to move when you're moving your eyes. Doesn't seem related to the shuttle's picture.

Now, narrowing it down. The key is that Tina saw the shuttle in one context (ready to launch) and couldn't recognize it in another (flying). So, it's about how her perception changed based on the new context.

Perceptual adaptation (Option C) seems to fit because it's about adjusting our perceptions when the environment changes. She adapted to seeing the shuttle in a static position, so when she saw it moving, her brain might have struggled to recognize it because it was a new context.

Perceptual set (Option E) is about a mental predisposition. If she was set to expect the shuttle in a certain way, that could also cause difficulty. But perceptual adaptation might be more about the change in context affecting recognition.

Wait, another angle: shape constancy (Option I) is about recognizing the same shape from different angles. But the shuttle's shape doesn't change, so maybe that's not it. It's more about the orientation, but shape constancy still applies because it's about recognizing the same object regardless of perspective. Hmm.

But in this case, the problem is that she didn't recognize it when moving. So, maybe it's about the difference between a stationary and moving image. So, her brain was used to the static image, and the moving one looked different. That's more about perceptual adaptation.

Alternatively, perceptual set could be about her mindset, expecting it to look a certain way. But I think perceptual adaptation is more about the change in the stimulus causing a change in perception.

So, I think the best answer is C: perceptual adaptation.

The scenario involves Young Tina struggling to recognize the space shuttle in a flying position after previously seeing it static. The key issue is how her perception changed when the context shifted from a stationary to a moving image. 

Analyzing the options, **perceptual adaptation (C)** best explains this difficulty. It refers to how our perceptions adjust when the environment changes, such as moving from a static to a dynamic visual context. Tina's brain adapted to the stationary image, making the moving shuttle harder to recognize. 

Other options, like **perceptual set (E)**, involve a predisposition to perceive things a certain way, but the question focuses on the change in context affecting recognition, which aligns more with perceptual adaptation. 

Thus, the best explanation is **C: perceptual adaptation**.
