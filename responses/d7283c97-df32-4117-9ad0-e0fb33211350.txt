Okay, so I've got this problem here about heat exchange between two infinite black parallel plates. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

Alright, the problem says the plates are initially at 100°F and 200°F. Then, we're supposed to increase the temperature difference by raising the second plate to 400°F. We need to find the increase in heat exchange. The options are given from A to J, and the answer is one of them.

Wait, so the initial temperatures are T1 = 100°F and T2 = 200°F. Then, T2 is increased to 400°F, making the new temperatures T1 = 100°F and T3 = 400°F. So the temperature difference changes from 100°F to 300°F. But wait, temperature in which units? Oh, right, the Stefan-Boltzmann law uses absolute temperature, probably in Rankine. So I need to convert these Fahrenheit temperatures to Rankine.

Let me recall: Rankine is Fahrenheit plus 459.67. So:
- T1_initial = 100°F → 100 + 459.67 = 559.67 °R
- T2_initial = 200°F → 200 + 459.67 = 659.67 °R
- T3 = 400°F → 400 + 459.67 = 859.67 °R

Wait, but in the Stefan-Boltzmann law, the radiated power is proportional to T^4. So the heat exchange (Q) between two plates is given by the formula:

Q = σ * A * (T2^4 - T1^4) / d

Wait, but wait, the problem says the plates are infinite and parallel, so the distance between them is 'd'. But the problem doesn't give the distance 'd' or the area. Wait, but looking back, the problem asks for the increase in heat exchange per unit area, I think. Because the options are in Btu/hr-ft², which is per area. So maybe the formula simplifies to Q per unit area, so Q/A = σ * (T_high^4 - T_low^4) / d.

Wait, but wait, the problem doesn't give 'd', the distance between the plates. Hmm, that's a problem. Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Oh, wait, perhaps the distance is the same before and after, so it cancels out when taking the increase. Or maybe the question is only about the change in heat rate, and perhaps the distance is not needed because it's a ratio, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for two black plates in thermal equilibrium is Q = σ * A * (T1^4 - T2^4) / d. Wait, but that would be the net heat flow from the hotter plate to the cooler plate.

Wait, let me think again. For two infinite black plates at T1 and T2, separated by distance d, the heat flux (Q/A) is given by σ*(T1^4 - T2^4)/(d). Or wait, is it the average? No, I think it's the difference in their fourth powers divided by the distance. Because each plate emits according to their own temperature.

Wait, but wait, for each plate, the heat emitted is εσA(T^4 - T_surrounding^4), but since it's a black plate, ε=1. But when two plates are facing each other, each plate emits radiation to the other. So the net heat flux from the hotter plate to the cooler plate would be σ*(T_high^4 - T_low^4)/(d).

Wait, but let me get this right. The Stefan-Boltzmann law says the power radiated per unit area is σT^4. So each plate emits σT1^4 and σT2^4 respectively. The net heat flow from the hotter plate to the cooler plate is the difference between these emissions. So the net Q/A is σ*(T_high^4 - T_low^4) / d. Because the heat emitted by the hotter plate is T_high^4, and the heat absorbed from the cooler plate is T_low^4, so the net is the difference, and since they're facing each other, the distance is d.

But wait, in this problem, the initial setup is T1=100°F and T2=200°F. So initial Q_initial per unit area is σ*(200^4 - 100^4)/(d). Then, after the temperature of the second plate is increased to 400°F, the new Q_final per unit area is σ*(400^4 - 100^4)/(d). The increase in heat exchange would be Q_final - Q_initial.

Wait, but the problem doesn't give 'd', so perhaps it's a ratio that the 'd' cancels out. Let me check: since both Q_initial and Q_final have the same 'd', when we subtract, it would still remain, but perhaps the problem expects us to compute the absolute increase, so we might need 'd' to compute it. But since the problem doesn't give 'd', maybe I'm missing something, or perhaps the formula doesn't involve 'd' because it's a unit area and maybe the distance is normalized or not provided. Alternatively, perhaps the formula I'm using is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the formula for two plates facing each other is Q = σ*A*(T1^4 - T2^4)/(d). So the heat flux per unit area is σ*(T1^4 - T2^4)/d. But without knowing 'd', I can't compute the exact value. Hmm, that's confusing. Maybe the problem assumes that 'd' is 1 ft, but that's just a guess. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula without 'd' because the distance is the same in both cases, so the ratio remains, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I should proceed with the calculation without considering 'd' because it's a per unit area basis, and perhaps the problem expects me to ignore 'd' or it's not needed. Alternatively, maybe the formula is different. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: the heat transfer rate between two black plates can be found using the formula:

Q = σ * (T1^4 - T2^4) / d

But wait, no, that's per unit area. So if I have two plates, the net heat flux is σ*(T_high^4 - T_low^4)/d.

So initial Q_initial: T_high = 200°F, T_low = 100°F.

Convert to Rankine: 200 + 459.67 = 659.67, 100 + 459.67 = 559.67.

So T_high^4 = (659.67)^4, T_low^4 = (559.67)^4.

Similarly, after the change, T_high becomes 400°F, which is 859.67 °R.

So Q_initial per unit area is σ*(659.67^4 - 559.67^4) / d.

Q_final per unit area is σ*(859.67^4 - 559.67^4)/d.

The increase is Q_final - Q_initial = σ/d * [ (859.67^4 - 559.67^4) - (659.67^4 - 559.67^4) ) ]

Simplify that: σ/d * [859.67^4 - 659.67^4 ]

But without 'd', I can't compute the numerical value. Hmm, perhaps the problem assumes that 'd' is 1 foot, or perhaps I'm missing a key point here.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me check the formula again. Oh, wait, perhaps the formula for two infinite plates is:

Q = (σ * A) / (d) * (T1^4 - T2^4)

So the heat rate Q is (σ*A/d)(T1^4 - T2^4). Since the problem asks for the increase in heat exchange per unit area, perhaps we're to compute the change per unit area, so (Q_final - Q_initial)/A = (σ/d)(T_high_final^4 - T_high_initial^4).

Wait, but without 'd', I can't compute this. Hmm, but looking at the answer options, they have units of Btu/hr-ft², which is per unit area. So perhaps 'd' is 1 foot, making the denominator 1, so it's just σ*(T_high^4 - T_low^4). But that seems odd. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is different.

Alternatively, perhaps I should model it using the two plates as each emitting radiation to each other. So the net heat transfer rate is the difference between the radiation emitted by the hotter plate and the radiation absorbed from the cooler plate.

Wait, let me think again. Each plate emits σ*T^4 towards the other. So the hotter plate emits σ*T_high^4, and the cooler plate emits σ*T_low^4. The net heat flow to the cooler plate from the hotter plate is σ*(T_high^4 - T_low^4)/d.

Wait, but that's per unit area. So if we compute the initial and final net heat flows, and find the difference, that would be the increase.

So initial net heat flux (per unit area):

Q_initial = σ*(T2_initial^4 - T1_initial^4)/d

T2_initial is 200°F, T1_initial is 100°F.

After increasing T2 to 400°F, the new net heat flux is:

Q_final = σ*(T2_final^4 - T1^4)/d

So the increase is Q_final - Q_initial = σ/d * (T2_final^4 - T1^4 - T2_initial^4 + T1^4 )

Which simplifies to σ/d * (T2_final^4 - T2_initial^4 )

But again, without knowing 'd', I can't compute the exact value. Hmm, maybe the problem expects me to assume that 'd' is 1 foot, so it's just σ*(T2_final^4 - T2_initial^4). Let's proceed with that assumption, even though it's unclear.

So let's compute the terms:

First, convert all temperatures to Rankine:

T1_initial = 100°F = 100 + 459.67 = 559.67 °R

T2_initial = 200°F = 200 + 459.67 = 659.67 °R

T2_final = 400°F = 400 + 459.67 = 859.67 °R

Compute T2_initial^4 = (659.67)^4

Similarly, T2_final^4 = (859.67)^4

Compute each term:

Let me compute 659.67^4:

First, 659.67^2 = (approx) 660^2 = 435,600. But more accurately:

659.67 * 659.67 = Let's compute:

659.67 * 659.67:

= (660 - 0.33)^2

≈ 660² - 2*660*0.33 + 0.33²

= 435600 - 435.6 + 0.1089 ≈ 435600 - 435.6 = 435164.4 + 0.1089 ≈ 435164.5089.

Then, 659.67^4 = (659.67^2)^2 ≈ (435164.5089)^2. Hmm, that's a big number. Maybe I can compute it step by step.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the value numerically using a calculator, but since I don't have one, I'll have to approximate.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the difference T2_final^4 - T2_initial^4 and see if there's a way to compute it without exact fourth powers.

Alternatively, perhaps I can factor the expression:

a^4 - b^4 = (a^2 + b^2)(a + b)(a - b)

So let's compute 859.67^4 - 659.67^4.

Let me denote a = 859.67, b = 659.67.

a^4 - b^4 = (a^2 + b^2)(a + b)(a - b)

Compute each term:

a - b = 859.67 - 659.67 = 200.

a + b = 859.67 + 659.67 = 1519.34.

a^2 = (859.67)^2 ≈ Let's compute 860^2 = 739600. So 859.67^2 ≈ 739,600 - (0.33)^2 + 2*860*(-0.33). Wait, maybe it's easier to compute as (860 - 0.33)^2 = 860² - 2*860*0.33 + 0.33² = 739,600 - 565.2 + 0.1089 ≈ 739,600 - 565.2 = 739,034.8 + 0.1089 ≈ 739,034.9089.

Similarly, b^2 = (659.67)^2 ≈ (660 - 0.33)^2 = 660² - 2*660*0.33 + 0.33² = 435,600 - 435.6 + 0.1089 ≈ 435,600 - 435.6 = 435,164.4 + 0.1089 ≈ 435,164.5089.

So a^2 + b^2 ≈ 739,034.9089 + 435,164.5089 ≈ 1,174,200.4178.

Now, multiply by (a + b) = 1519.34 and (a - b) = 200.

So a^4 - b^4 = (1,174,200.4178) * 1519.34 * 200.

Wait, that seems very large. Let me compute step by step.

First, compute 1,174,200.4178 * 1519.34.

Hmm, that's a huge number, but perhaps I can approximate.

Alternatively, perhaps I should proceed with the calculation:

Compute (a^2 + b^2) = 1,174,200.4178.

Multiply by (a + b) = 1519.34:

1,174,200.4178 * 1519.34 ≈ Let's approximate:

1,174,200 * 1,500 = 1,761,300,000.

But more accurately, 1,174,200 * 1,519.34 ≈ Let me compute 1,174,200 * 1,500 = 1,761,300,000, and 1,174,200 * 19.34 ≈ 1,174,200 * 20 = 23,484,000 minus 1,174,200 * 0.66 ≈ 776,  let's say approximately 23,484,000 - 776,000 ≈ 22,708,000.

So total ≈ 1,761,300,000 + 22,708,000 ≈ 1,783,008,000.

Then, multiply by (a - b) = 200:

1,783,008,000 * 200 = 356,601,600,000.

So a^4 - b^4 ≈ 356,601,600,000 (°R)^4.

Now, the heat increase per unit area is:

ΔQ = σ * (a^4 - b^4) / d.

But without 'd', I'm stuck. Wait, but looking back, the problem statement says to compute the increase in heat exchange. The options are in Btu/hr-ft², which is per unit area. So perhaps 'd' is 1 foot, making the denominator 1, so ΔQ = σ * (a^4 - b^4).

Given σ = 0.1714 × 10^-8 Btu/hr-ft²-°R^4.

So σ = 0.1714e-8 Btu/(hr·ft²·°R^4).

So ΔQ = 0.1714e-8 Btu/(hr·ft²·°R^4) * 356,601,600,000 °R^4.

Compute this:

0.1714e-8 * 356,601,600,000 = 0.1714 * 356,601,600,000 * 1e-8.

Compute 356,601,600,000 * 1e-8 = 3,566.016.

Then, 0.1714 * 3,566.016 ≈ Let's compute:

0.1714 * 3,500 = 599.9 (approx 600).

0.1714 * 66.016 ≈ approx 11.28.

So total ≈ 600 + 11.28 ≈ 611.28 Btu/hr·ft².

Looking at the options, option F is 612 Btu/hr-ft², which is very close. So the answer should be F.
</think>

The increase in heat exchange is calculated using the Stefan-Boltzmann law. The initial and final temperatures are converted to Rankine, and the heat flux difference is computed. Assuming the distance \( d = 1 \, \text{ft} \), the increase in heat exchange per unit area is approximately \( 612 \, \text{Btu/hr-ft}^2 \).

Answer: F
