Alright, I'm trying to figure out what passive personality jurisdiction means. I remember from my law classes that jurisdiction can be based on different factors, and passive personality is one of them. Let me think about the options given.

Passive personality jurisdictionâ€”okay, I think it's related to where the person is connected, maybe their nationality. So, passive personality jurisdiction usually refers to a state exercising jurisdiction over a crime because the victim is a national of that state. That makes sense because the state has an interest in protecting its citizens. 

Looking at the options, option D says it's based on the nationality of the victims. That seems right. Let me go through the other options to be sure.

Option A is about where the legal person was registered. That sounds more like territorial jurisdiction or maybe corporate law, not passive personality. 

Option B is about the nationality of the offender. Wait, that might be active personality jurisdiction, where the state has jurisdiction over its own nationals regardless of where the crime happens. 

Option C is the relationship between victim and offender. I'm not sure about that; it doesn't directly relate to passive personality. 

Option E is severity of the offence. That doesn't sound like a basis for jurisdiction; more about the punishment perhaps. 

Option F is where the crime was planned. That's more about territorial jurisdiction or maybe another form, not passive. 

Option G is international law applicable. International law might influence jurisdiction, but it's not the basis here. 

Option H is the residence of the offender. That could tie into jurisdiction, but passive personality is about the victim, not the offender's residence. 

Option I is where the offence was committed. That's territorial jurisdiction, the most common basis. 

Option J is the nationality of the witness. Witnesses are involved, but jurisdiction isn't based on their nationality in passive personality cases. 

So, putting it all together, passive personality jurisdiction is based on the victim's nationality. That's option D.

The correct answer is D: It is jurisdiction based on the nationality of the victims.
