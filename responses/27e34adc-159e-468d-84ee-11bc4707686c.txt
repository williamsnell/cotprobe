Okay, so I need to answer this multiple-choice question about Baxter's view on environmental problems. The question is asking about the first step towards a solution, specifically what the objective is not. The options are from A to J.

I remember that Baxter is associated with environmental ethics, particularly the idea of letting nature take its course. He's critical of human intervention in nature, advocating for letting natural systems regulate themselves. So, I think his approach is more about not interfering rather than trying to achieve a specific state like pure air or water.

The question says the objective is not pure air or water. So the answer should be something that contradicts the idea of making everything pristine. Baxter probably thinks that pure environments aren't the goal because nature itself isn't pure, and human attempts to make it so can be counterproductive.

Looking at the options, option C is "an overall maximally clean environment." That sounds like the opposite of what Baxter would support. He might argue that trying to make everything maximally clean isn't feasible and could disrupt natural processes.

Option H says "a state of pollution that supports human health and well-being." That seems more like a human-centric approach, which might align with some views but not necessarily Baxter's. He's more about letting nature be, even if it means some pollution as part of natural cycles.

Option I is "some optimal state of pollution." That also suggests a specific target, which again doesn't fit with Baxter's approach. He would probably say the goal isn't to find an optimal pollution level but to reduce human interference.

Option E is "some maximal state of pollution," which seems similar but in the opposite direction. But the question is about what the objective is not, so perhaps the correct answer is C, as the first step is to recognize that pure air and water aren't the goal.

Wait, the question says the first step is clear recognition that our objective is not pure air or water but rather... So the correct answer would be what Baxter says it is instead of pure air/water. So the answer should be the opposite of pure, perhaps allowing some pollution or a balance.

Wait, the options don't directly say that. The question is phrased as "the objective is not... but rather..." So the correct answer is what Baxter does propose as the objective.

Wait, I need to think again. The question is asking what the objective is not. So, for example, if Baxter says the objective is not pure air or water, but something else, like an optimal state or supporting human health.

Wait, the question is phrased: "the first and foremost step toward a solution of our environmental problems is a clear recognition that our objective is not pure air or water but rather..." So the answer is what Baxter believes it is instead of pure air or water.

So the options are what it is, not what it isn't. So the correct answer is the alternative to pure air and water that Baxter suggests.

Baxter's view is that we shouldn't try to make everything pure but instead let nature take its course. So perhaps the correct answer is that the objective is some maximal state of pollution, but that doesn't sound right. Alternatively, maybe it's an environment that supports human health, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: Baxter is often associated with the idea that human intervention is causing more harm, so the solution is to minimize interference. Therefore, the objective isn't to eliminate all pollution, but perhaps to find a balance where nature can regulate itself.

Looking at the options, option I is "some optimal state of pollution." That might be the idea, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, option E is "some maximal state of pollution," which sounds like it's the maximum acceptable pollution, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is H: a state of pollution that supports human health and well-being. That could be it, as it's about managing pollution to a level that's acceptable for humans, rather than trying to eliminate all pollution.

Alternatively, option I is about an optimal state, which might align with a more balanced approach. I'm a bit confused, but I think the answer is I: some optimal state of pollution. Because Baxter would argue that trying to achieve pure air and water isn't the right approach, and instead we should aim for an optimal balance where nature can function without constant human interference.

The correct answer is I: some optimal state of pollution. Baxter's view suggests that the objective is not to achieve pure air or water but to find a balance where nature can regulate itself, aiming for an optimal state rather than complete elimination of pollution.
