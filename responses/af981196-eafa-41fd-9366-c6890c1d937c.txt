Question:

 Select the best English interpretation of the given arguments in predicate logic.
(∃x)(Cx • Ox)
(∀x)[(~Cx ⊃ ~Bx) ⊃ ~Og]	/ ~Og

Options:

A: Some cookies have oatmeal. If something's not having chocolate chips entails that it is not a cookie, then it doesn't have oatmeal. So this cookie doesn't have oatmeal.
B: Some cookies have oatmeal. If something's not being a cookie entails that it doesn't have oatmeal, then this cookie doesn't have chocolate chips. So this cookie doesn't have oatmeal.
C: Some cookies have oatmeal. If something's not being a cookie entails that it doesn't have chocolate chips, then this cookie doesn't have oatmeal. So this cookie doesn't have oatmeal.
D: Some cookies have oatmeal. If something's not a cookie, it does not have oatmeal, and it does not have chocolate chips. So this cookie doesn't have oatmeal.
E: Some cookies have oatmeal. If something is a cookie, it does not have chocolate chips, and it doesn't have oatmeal. So this cookie doesn't have oatmeal.
F: Some cookies have oatmeal. If something's not being a cookie entails that it does have chocolate chips, then this cookie doesn't have oatmeal. So this cookie doesn't have oatmeal.
G: Some cookies have oatmeal. If something is not a cookie and does not have chocolate chips, it doesn't have oatmeal. So this cookie doesn't have oatmeal.
H: Some cookies have oatmeal. If something doesn't have oatmeal, then it is not a cookie and it doesn't have chocolate chips. So this cookie doesn't have oatmeal.
I: Some cookies have oatmeal. If something does not have chocolate chips, then it is not a cookie and therefore, it doesn't have oatmeal. So this cookie doesn't have oatmeal.
J: Some cookies have oatmeal. If something's not a cookie, it doesn't have chocolate chips. So this cookie has oatmeal.

Okay, so I've got this logic problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the correct answer. Let me break it down step by step.

The question is about translating predicate logic statements into English. The given statements are:

1. (∃x)(Cx • Ox)
2. (∀x)[(~Cx ⊃ ~Bx) ⊃ ~Og]
3. / ~Og

And the options are A through J, each with a different English interpretation. I need to select the best one.

First, let me parse each part of the logic.

Starting with the first statement: (∃x)(Cx • Ox). This is an existential statement. The existential quantifier (∃x) means "there exists some x such that..." Cx is "x is a cookie," and Ox is "x has oatmeal." So the first statement translates to "Some cookies have oatmeal." That seems straightforward.

Now, the second statement is a bit more complex: (∀x)[(~Cx ⊃ ~Bx) ⊃ ~Og]. Let's break this down. The universal quantifier (∀x) means "for all x." The inner part is (~Cx ⊃ ~Bx). So, if "~Cx" is "x is not a cookie," then "~Cx implies ~Bx" would mean "if x is not a cookie, then x does not have Bx." Wait, but what is Bx? The problem doesn't define it, but looking at the options, it's likely "Bx" stands for "has chocolate chips." So ~Bx would be "does not have chocolate chips." So the inner implication is "If x is not a cookie, then x does not have chocolate chips."

But then the entire statement is wrapped in another implication: [ (if ~Cx then ~Bx) ] implies ~Og. So the structure is: For all x, if (if ~Cx then ~Bx) holds, then ~Og. Wait, that seems a bit confusing. Let me think again.

Alternatively, maybe I should look at the entire second statement. It's written as (∀x)[(~Cx ⊃ ~Bx) ⊃ ~Og]. Wait, that might be misread. Let me parse it more carefully.

The second statement is: For all x, [ (not Cx implies not Bx) implies not Og ]. So, for every x, if the statement (¬Cx → ¬Bx) is true, then ¬Og must be true.

Wait, but ¬Og is a constant? Or perhaps it's a typo, maybe it should be something else. Oh wait, no, the conclusion is ~Og, which is the same as ¬Og. So the conclusion is that something does not have oatmeal.

Wait, but the second statement is ∀x [ (¬Cx → ¬Bx) → ¬Og ].

Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure. Let me try to write it in English.

The second statement can be read as: For all x, if (if x is not a cookie, then x does not have chocolate chips), then x does not have oatmeal. Or perhaps more accurately, if (not being a cookie implies not having chocolate chips), then x does not have oatmeal.

Wait, that seems a bit odd. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the entire implication. The second statement is a universal statement, so it's about all x, but the conclusion is ~Og, which is a single statement. So perhaps it's more accurate to say that if (for all x, if x is not a cookie then x does not have chocolate chips), then something (Og) is not true.

Wait, that might not make sense. Let me try to rephrase.

Wait, perhaps the second statement is: For all x, (¬Cx → ¬Bx) → ¬Og. So, for every x, if x is not a cookie, then if x doesn't have chocolate chips, x doesn't have oatmeal. Or perhaps it's structured as: If (for any x, not being a cookie implies not having chocolate chips), then something doesn't have oatmeal.

Wait, that's getting a bit tangled. Alternatively, perhaps the second statement is a conditional: If something is not a cookie, then it doesn't have chocolate chips, and that implies it doesn't have oatmeal.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to look at the entire formula again. The second statement is ∀x [ (¬Cx → ¬Bx) → ¬Og ].

Wait, but that would mean that for all x, if (¬Cx → ¬Bx) is true, then ¬Og is true. But that seems a bit odd because ¬Og is a single statement, not dependent on x. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the structure.

Wait, perhaps the second statement is actually: For all x, (¬Cx → ¬Bx) implies ¬Og(x). But then, in the formula, it's written as ~Og, which is a constant, not a function of x. Hmm, perhaps there's a typo, and it should be ~Ox, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the second statement is: For all x, if (x is not a cookie implies x is not a chocolate chip cookie), then x does not have oatmeal. So, for any x, if the condition that non-cookies don't have chocolate chips holds, then x doesn't have oatmeal. But that doesn't quite make sense, because the conclusion is about x not having oatmeal.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the formula is written as ∀x [ (¬Cx → ¬Bx) → ¬Og ], which would mean that if for any x, not being a cookie implies not having chocolate chips, then something doesn't have oatmeal. But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe it's better to approach this by looking at the options and seeing which one aligns with the logical structure.

The conclusion is ~Og, which is the same as saying "something does not have oatmeal." So the argument is:

1. Some cookies have oatmeal. (There exists at least one x where Cx and Ox.)

2. For all x, if (¬Cx → ¬Bx) then ¬Og.

Wait, but that seems a bit confusing. Let me try to rephrase the second statement as an English sentence.

The second statement is ∀x [ (¬Cx → ¬Bx) → ¬Og ]. So, for any x, if (if x is not a cookie, then x is not a chocolate chip), then x does not have oatmeal.

Wait, but that doesn't quite make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the second statement is interpreted as: If something is not a cookie, then it doesn't have chocolate chips, and from that, we can conclude that it doesn't have oatmeal.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to think of the second statement as: For all x, if (¬Cx → ¬Bx) is true, then ¬Og is true. So, if non-cookies don't have chocolate chips, then something doesn't have oatmeal.

Wait, but that seems a bit off. Alternatively, perhaps the second statement is: For all x, (¬Cx → ¬Bx) implies ¬Og, which might be rephrased as: If for any x, not being a cookie implies not having Bx (chocolate chips), then something doesn't have oatmeal.

Alternatively, perhaps the second statement is a single conditional: If something is not a cookie, then it doesn't have Bx, and from that, we can conclude that it doesn't have Ox (oatmeal).

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me try to approach this differently by looking at the options and seeing which one aligns with the logical steps.

The first premise is straightforward: Some cookies have oatmeal. So any option that starts with that is correct.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Some cookies have oatmeal. If something's not having chocolate chips entails that it is not a cookie, then it doesn't have oatmeal. So this cookie doesn't have oatmeal.

Wait, the second part seems to reverse the implication. The second statement is [¬Cx → ¬Bx], which is "If not a cookie, then not Bx." But in option A, it's phrased as "If something's not having chocolate chips (¬Bx) entails that it is not a cookie (¬Cx)." That's the converse of the original implication. The original is ¬Cx → ¬Bx, which is not the same as ¬Bx → ¬Cx. So option A seems to have the converse.

Option B: Some cookies have oatmeal. If something's not being a cookie entails that it doesn't have oatmeal, then this cookie doesn't have chocolate chips. So this cookie doesn't have oatmeal.

Hmm, the second part here says "If not being a cookie entails not having oatmeal," which would be ¬Cx → ¬Ox. But the original statement is ¬Cx → ¬Bx, so that's not matching. Also, the conclusion is about not having chocolate chips, which doesn't seem to follow.

Option C: Some cookies have oatmeal. If something's not being a cookie entails that it doesn't have chocolate chips, then this cookie doesn't have oatmeal. So this cookie doesn't have oatmeal.

This seems closer. The second part says if not being a cookie implies not having Bx (chocolate chips), then the cookie doesn't have oatmeal. Wait, but the original statement is ∀x [ (¬Cx → ¬Bx) → ¬Og ]. So for all x, if (¬Cx → ¬Bx) is true, then ¬Og is true. But in this option, it's phrased as "If something's not being a cookie entails that it doesn't have chocolate chips," which is ¬Cx → ¬Bx. So the implication is that if this condition holds, then this cookie doesn't have oatmeal. But I'm not sure how the conclusion is drawn.

Option D: Some cookies have oatmeal. If something is not a cookie, it does not have oatmeal, and it does not have chocolate chips. So this cookie doesn't have oatmeal.

This seems to conflate two things. The original statement is about ¬Cx implying ¬Bx, not ¬Ox. So it's saying that non-cookies don't have Bx, but option D says non-cookies don't have Ox, which is different.

Option E: Some cookies have oatmeal. If something is a cookie, it does not have chocolate chips, and it doesn't have oatmeal. So this cookie doesn't have oatmeal.

This seems to reverse the implication. The second statement is about ¬Cx implying ¬Bx, not about Cx implying ¬Bx. So option E is the inverse.

Option F: Some cookies have oatmeal. If something's not being a cookie entails that it does have chocolate chips, then this cookie doesn't have oatmeal. So this cookie doesn't have oatmeal.

This seems to have the opposite implication. If ¬Cx → Bx, which is not what the original says. The original is ¬Cx → ¬Bx, so F is incorrect.

Option G: Some cookies have oatmeal. If something is not a cookie and does not have chocolate chips, it doesn't have oatmeal. So this cookie doesn't have oatmeal.

This seems to mix two conditions. The original is ¬Cx → ¬Bx, which is a single implication, not a conjunction. So G is saying that if something is not a cookie and lacks Bx, then it lacks Ox. But the original statement is a universal implication that if ¬Cx, then ¬Bx, leading to ¬Og.

Option H: Some cookies have oatmeal. If something doesn't have oatmeal, then it is not a cookie and it doesn't have chocolate chips. So this cookie doesn't have oatmeal.

This seems to reverse the implication. The original is ¬Cx → ¬Bx, but H is saying ¬Ox → ¬Cx ∧ ¬Bx, which is a different statement.

Option I: Some cookies have oatmeal. If something does not have chocolate chips, then it is not a cookie and therefore, it doesn't have oatmeal. So this cookie doesn't have oatmeal.

This seems to have the converse implication. The original is ¬Cx → ¬Bx, but I is saying ¬Bx → ¬Cx ∧ ¬Ox, which is different.

Option J: Some cookies have oatmeal. If something's not a cookie, it doesn't have chocolate chips. So this cookie has oatmeal.

This seems to correctly state the second premise as ¬Cx → ¬Bx, but the conclusion is that the cookie has oatmeal, which contradicts the conclusion of the argument, which is ~Og (assuming "g" is a specific instance, perhaps "this cookie"?). Wait, the conclusion is ~Og, which would mean that "this cookie" doesn't have oatmeal. So option J's conclusion is that it does have oatmeal, which is the opposite of the argument's conclusion, so J is incorrect.

Wait, but looking back, the argument's conclusion is ~Og, which is "does not have oatmeal." So J's conclusion is that this cookie has oatmeal, which contradicts, so J is wrong.

Now, going back to the options, let's see which one correctly represents the second premise and the conclusion.

The second premise is ∀x [ (¬Cx → ¬Bx) → ¬Og ]. So for all x, if (¬Cx → ¬Bx) is true, then ¬Og is true.

Wait, but that seems a bit odd because ¬Og is a single statement, not quantified. Maybe it's a typo, and it should be ∀x [ (¬Cx → ¬Bx) → ¬Ox ], but assuming it's correct as given, perhaps it's better to think of it as a conditional statement where the antecedent is (¬Cx → ¬Bx) for all x, and the consequent is ¬Og.

Alternatively, perhaps the second statement is intended to be: If something is not a cookie, then it does not have chocolate chips, and from that, we can conclude that it does not have oatmeal.

Wait, but that would be (∀x)(¬Cx → ¬Bx) ⊃ ¬Og. So if for all x, ¬Cx → ¬Bx, then ¬Og. So the argument would be:

1. Some cookies have oatmeal.
2. If for all x, ¬Cx → ¬Bx, then ¬Og.
Therefore, ¬Og.

But I'm not sure if that's the case. Alternatively, perhaps the second statement is structured as a universal implication, so that for every x, (¬Cx → ¬Bx) implies ¬Og, but that would mean that for each x, if ¬Cx → ¬Bx is true, then ¬Og is true, which is a bit confusing because ¬Og is not dependent on x.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me look at option C again.

Option C: Some cookies have oatmeal. If something's not being a cookie entails that it doesn't have chocolate chips, then this cookie doesn't have oatmeal. So this cookie doesn't have oatmeal.

This seems to correctly represent the second premise as ∀x (¬Cx → ¬Bx), and then from that, it concludes that this cookie doesn't have oatmeal. But how does that follow?

Wait, the first premise is that some cookies have oatmeal, meaning there exists at least one x where Cx and Ox. The second premise is that for all x, if ¬Cx → ¬Bx, meaning non-cookies don't have Bx (chocolate chips). But how does that lead to ¬Og, i.e., this cookie doesn't have oatmeal?

Wait, perhaps the argument is using modus tollens. Let's see:

If (¬Cx → ¬Bx) is true, and we know that some cookie has oatmeal, then perhaps we can derive that ¬Og.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the conclusion is that if non-cookies don't have Bx, then the existence of a cookie with Ox leads to a contradiction unless that cookie doesn't have Ox.

Wait, maybe not. Let me think differently. Suppose we have a cookie, say 'g', that has oatmeal. Then, according to the second premise, for all x, if x is not a cookie, then x doesn't have Bx. But we know that 'g' is a cookie and has Ox. How does that relate?

Wait, perhaps the argument is trying to say that if non-cookies don't have Bx, then the existence of a cookie with Ox implies that the cookie must have Bx, leading to a contradiction, hence ¬Og.

Wait, that might make sense. Let me try to structure it:

1. Some cookies have oatmeal. So, there exists x such that Cx and Ox.

2. For all x, if x is not a cookie, then x doesn't have Bx.

Assume that 'g' is the specific cookie that has oatmeal (from the first premise). Now, we need to show that 'g' does not have oatmeal, which seems contradictory, but perhaps the logic is different.

Wait, perhaps the argument is using the second premise to derive that if a cookie has oatmeal, it must have Bx, which would contradict the second premise if non-cookies don't have Bx.

Wait, perhaps not. Let me try to think of it as a syllogism.

From the first premise, we have that some cookies have oatmeal. From the second premise, for all x, if x is not a cookie, then x doesn't have Bx. Therefore, if 'g' is a cookie, and we know that some cookies have oatmeal, perhaps 'g' must have Bx, but that doesn't directly lead to ¬Og.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me try to write the steps:

1. ∃x (Cx ∧ Ox) (Some cookies have oatmeal.)
2. ∀x [(¬Cx → ¬Bx) → ¬Og] (If something is not a cookie, then it doesn't have Bx, which implies ¬Og.)
Conclusion: ¬Og (This cookie doesn't have oatmeal.)

Wait, but how does the second premise lead to the conclusion? The second premise is a universal statement that for all x, if (¬Cx → ¬Bx) is true, then ¬Og is true. So if (¬Cx → ¬Bx) holds for all x, then ¬Og must hold.

But in the first premise, we have that some x has Cx and Ox. Let's say 'g' is that x. So 'g' is a cookie with oatmeal. Now, applying the second premise: For 'g', since 'g' is a cookie (Cx is true), the implication (¬Cx → ¬Bx) is vacuously true because ¬Cx is false. So the implication holds, and thus ¬Og must be true. Therefore, 'g' does not have oatmeal, which contradicts the first premise. Wait, that can't be right because the first premise says some cookies have oatmeal, so 'g' must have both Cx and Ox. But the conclusion says ¬Og, which would mean 'g' doesn't have Ox, leading to a contradiction.

Hmm, perhaps the argument is structured differently. Maybe the second premise is being used to derive that if a cookie exists with Ox, then it must have Bx, leading to a contradiction if non-cookies don't have Bx.

Alternatively, perhaps the argument is using the second premise to say that if non-cookies don't have Bx, then any cookie must have Bx, and if a cookie has Ox, then it must have Bx, but that doesn't necessarily lead to ¬Og unless there's a contradiction.

I'm getting a bit stuck here, so perhaps I should look back at the options to see which one aligns with the logical structure.

Looking at option C again: "If something's not being a cookie entails that it doesn't have chocolate chips, then this cookie doesn't have oatmeal."

The second part of the option seems to correctly state the second premise as ∀x (¬Cx → ¬Bx), and then it concludes that this cookie doesn't have oatmeal.

Wait, but how does the second premise lead to that conclusion? Because the first premise says that some cookies do have oatmeal. So if we have a cookie that has oatmeal, and the second premise says that non-cookies don't have Bx, how does that lead to this cookie not having oatmeal?

Perhaps the argument is using modus tollens. Let's suppose that if a cookie had oatmeal, then it would have Bx, but the second premise says that non-cookies don't have Bx, so perhaps the only way for a cookie to have Bx is if it's a cookie. But that doesn't directly lead to the conclusion that the cookie doesn't have oatmeal.

Wait, maybe the argument is structured as follows:

1. Some cookies have oatmeal. So there exists a cookie 'g' with Ox.

2. The second premise says that for all x, if x is not a cookie, then x doesn't have Bx.

Now, suppose 'g' is a cookie with Ox. Then, from the second premise, since 'g' is a cookie, the implication (¬Cx → ¬Bx) is true for 'g' because ¬Cx is false. So the implication holds, and thus ¬Og must be true. But that would mean 'g' doesn't have Ox, which contradicts the first premise. Therefore, the assumption must be wrong, and the conclusion is that 'g' doesn't have Ox.

Wait, but that seems to be a form of modus tollens. So the argument is:

- Assume that there exists a cookie 'g' with Ox.

- From the second premise, for all x, (¬Cx → ¬Bx) implies ¬Og.

- Therefore, 'g' must not have Ox, which contradicts the first premise unless we conclude that ¬Og.

So the argument is leading to the conclusion that ¬Og.

Looking back at the options, option C says:

"If something's not being a cookie entails that it doesn't have chocolate chips, then this cookie doesn't have oatmeal."

So the structure is:

- Some cookies have oatmeal.

- If (¬Cx → ¬Bx) then ¬Og.

Therefore, ¬Og.

Which matches the argument's structure.

So option C seems to correctly capture the logical steps.
</think>

The correct answer is option C. The argument translates as follows:

1. Some cookies have oatmeal.
2. If something's not being a cookie entails that it doesn't have chocolate chips, then this cookie doesn't have oatmeal.
Therefore, this cookie doesn't have oatmeal.

Answer: C
