Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the mole percent of butane in a mixture of ethane and butane. The problem gives me the volume of the bulb, the pressure, temperature, and the total mass of the gas. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.

First, I remember that the ideal gas law is PV = nRT. But wait, in this case, since it's a mixture of two gases, I can consider the total moles of the gas mixture. Oh right, because each gas contributes to the total pressure, but since they're in the same container, their total moles add up.

So the given data is:
- Volume (V) = 230.0 cm³. Oh wait, that's in cm³, which is 0.230 liters because 1 liter is 1000 cm³. So V = 0.230 L.
- Pressure (P) = 97.5 × 10³ Pa. I need to convert this to atm because R is usually in L·atm/(mol·K). I remember that 1 atm is about 101325 Pa. So let me calculate that. 97.5e3 Pa divided by 101325 Pa/atm. Let me do that: 97500 / 101325 ≈ 0.962 atm.
- Temperature (T) = 23.1°C. I need to convert that to Kelvin. So 23.1 + 273.15 = 296.25 K.
- Mass of the gas (m) = 0.3554 g. So the total mass of ethane and butane together is 0.3554 grams.

Let me denote the variables more clearly. Let’s say the mixture has ethane (C₂H₆) and butane (C₄H₁₀). Let me let x be the mole fraction of butane, and (1-x) be the mole fraction of ethane.

But wait, actually, I think I should let the moles of ethane be n1 and moles of butane be n2. Then total moles n = n1 + n2.

Alternatively, since it's a mole percent question, maybe it's easier to think in terms of mole fractions. But let me see.

So the ideal gas law gives PV = nRT. So n = PV/(RT). Let me compute n.

P is approximately 0.962 atm, V is 0.230 L, R is 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K), T is 296.25 K.

Calculating n: 0.962 * 0.230 / (0.0821 * 296.25).

Let me compute denominator first: 0.0821 * 296.25 ≈ 0.0821 * 300 ≈ 24.63, but more accurately, 296.25 *0.0821 = let me calculate: 296.25 * 0.08 is 23.7, 296.25 *0.0021 is about 0.622, so total ≈24.322.

So numerator: 0.962 * 0.230 ≈ 0.22126.

So n ≈ 0.22126 / 24.322 ≈ approximately 0.009096 mol. So total moles n is about 0.0091 mol.

Now, the total mass is 0.3554 g. Let me denote the moles of ethane as n1 and butane as n2. So n1 + n2 = 0.009096 mol.

The mass contributed by ethane is n1 * molar mass of ethane. The molar mass of C₂H₆ is 2*12.01 + 6*1.008 = 24.02 + 6.048 = 30.068 g/mol.

Similarly, the molar mass of butane, C₄H₁₀, is 4*12.01 +10*1.008 = 48.04 +10.08 =58.12 g/mol.

So, the total mass is n1*30.068 + n2*58.12 = 0.3554 g.

We have two equations:

1. n1 + n2 = 0.009096
2. 30.068 n1 +58.12 n2 = 0.3554

Let me write these as:

n1 = 0.009096 - n2

Substituting into equation 2:

30.068*(0.009096 - n2) +58.12 n2 = 0.3554

Expanding:

30.068*0.009096 -30.068 n2 +58.12 n2 = 0.3554

Calculate 30.068 *0.009096 ≈ 0.273 grams.

So:

0.273 + (58.12 -30.068) n2 = 0.3554

58.12 -30.068 is 28.052.

So:

0.273 +28.052 n2 = 0.3554

Subtract 0.273: 28.052 n2 = 0.0824

n2 = 0.0824 /28.052 ≈ 0.002938 mol.

So n2 ≈ 0.002938 mol, which is the moles of butane. Then the mole fraction of butane is n2/(n1 + n2) = 0.002938 /0.009096 ≈ 0.323, or 32.3%.

Looking at the options, H is 32%, so the answer should be H.

To determine the mole percent of butane in the gas mixture, we start by using the ideal gas law to calculate the total moles of gas. The given data includes the volume of the bulb, pressure, temperature, and total mass of the gas. Using the ideal gas law, we find the total moles of gas, which is approximately 0.0091 mol. 

Next, we set up two equations based on the total moles and total mass of the gas mixture. Let \( n_1 \) represent the moles of ethane and \( n_2 \) represent the moles of butane. The equations are:

1. \( n_1 + n_2 = 0.0091 \)
2. \( 30.068n_1 + 58.12n_2 = 0.3554 \)

By solving these equations, we find that \( n_2 \), the moles of butane, is approximately 0.002938 mol. The mole percent of butane is then calculated as:

\[
\text{Mole percent of butane} = \frac{n_2}{n_1 + n_2} \times 100 = \frac{0.002938}{0.0091} \times 100 \approx 32\%.
\]

Thus, the mole percent of butane in the mixture is **32%**, corresponding to option **H**.
