Question:

The mean daily demand for bread at a popular bakery is 2,500 loaves, with a standard deviation of 225 loaves. Every morning the bakery bakes 3,000 loaves. What is the probability that today it will run out of bread? Assume that the mean daily demand for bread at this bakery is normally distributed.

Options:

A: 0.9869
B: 0.5234
C: 0.6875
D: 0.0132
E: 0.3500
F: 0.4589
G: 0.8333
H: 0.2314
I: 0.7500
J: 0.1667

Okay, so I've got this problem here about a bakery and their bread demand. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

Alright, the mean daily demand is 2,500 loaves, and the standard deviation is 225 loaves. The bakery bakes 3,000 loaves every morning. The question is asking for the probability that today they'll run out of bread. Hmm, running out of bread would mean that the demand is higher than what they've baked, right? So, if the demand exceeds 3,000 loaves, they'll run out. 

Since the demand is normally distributed, I can use the properties of the normal distribution to find this probability. I remember that in a normal distribution, about 68% of the data falls within one standard deviation, 95% within two, and so on. But I think I need to calculate the Z-score here to find the exact probability.

The Z-score formula is (X - μ) / σ, where X is the value we're interested in, μ is the mean, and σ is the standard deviation. In this case, X is 3,000 because that's the point where they run out. So plugging in the numbers: (3000 - 2500) / 225. Let me calculate that. 

3000 minus 2500 is 500. Then, 500 divided by 225 is approximately 2.2222. So the Z-score is about 2.22. 

Now, I need to find the probability that the demand is greater than 3,000, which is the same as the probability that Z is greater than 2.22. Since the normal distribution is symmetric, I can look up the Z-value in a standard normal distribution table or use a calculator to find the area to the right of this Z-score.

Wait, I remember that the standard normal table gives the area to the left of the Z-score. So if I find P(Z < 2.22), that gives me the area up to 2.22, and then I subtract that from 1 to get the area to the right, which is the probability of exceeding 3,000.

Looking up 2.22 in the Z-table. Let me think, the Z-table for 2.22 would be around 0.9868. So P(Z < 2.22) ≈ 0.9868. Therefore, the probability of Z being greater than 2.22 is 1 - 0.9868 = 0.0132.

Wait, that seems a bit low, but considering the mean is 2500 and the standard deviation is 225, 3000 is about 2.22 standard deviations above the mean. In a normal distribution, about 1.32% of the data lies beyond 2.22 standard deviations. So that would make the probability about 1.32%, which is 0.0132.

Looking at the options, option D is 0.0132. So that should be the correct answer.

The probability that the bakery will run out of bread is determined by finding the probability that daily demand exceeds 3,000 loaves. Using the Z-score formula, the Z-score is calculated as (3000 - 2500)/225 ≈ 2.22. The area to the right of Z = 2.22 in the standard normal distribution gives the probability, which is approximately 0.0132. 

Answer: D
