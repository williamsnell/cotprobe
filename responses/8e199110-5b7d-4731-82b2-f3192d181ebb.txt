Answer:
    
<think>
Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about oxidation-reduction reactions, and I'm supposed to figure out which reaction is most likely to occur based on their standard reduction potentials. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

First, I remember that in redox reactions, the substance with a higher reduction potential tends to be reduced, and the one with a lower potential is oxidized. So the more easily a substance is reduced (has a higher E°), it will act as the oxidizing agent, and the other will act as the reducing agent, getting oxidized.

The question gives me several options, labeled A through I. Each option is a reaction where a metal reacts with a nitrate solution, producing another metal and a nitrate compound. I need to determine which of these reactions is feasible based on the standard E° values.

I think I should list out the possible metal ions and their standard reduction potentials. From what I recall, here are some key E° values (in volts) for common metals:

- Li+ + e- → Li: E° = -3.04 V
- K+ + e- → K: E° = -2.93 V
- Ba²+ + 2e- → Ba: E° = -2.98 V (I think it's around there)
- Mg²+ + 2e- → Mg: E° = -2.37 V
- Al³+ + 3e- → Al: E° = -1.66 V
- Zn²+ + 2e- → Zn: E° = -0.76 V
- Fe²+ + 2e- → Fe: E° = -0.44 V
- Pb²+ + 2e- → Pb: E° = -0.13 V
- Ni²+ + 2e- → Ni: E° = -0.23 V (Wait, I might have that wrong; I think Ni is around -0.28 V)
- Cu²+ + 2e- → Cu: E° = 0.34 V
- Ag+ + e- → Ag: E° = 0.80 V
- Hg²+ + 2e- → Hg: E° = 0.79 V (Wait, or is it Hg²²+? I'm a bit confused here.)
- Fe³+ + e- → Fe²+: E° = 0.77 V (I think this is for the Fe³+ to Fe²+ reduction)
- And for the nitrate ion, I remember that nitrate can act as an oxidizing agent in acidic conditions. The reduction of NO3^- to NO or N2 might have different E° values, but in these reactions, the nitrate is probably being reduced to its respective metal's ion.

Wait, but in each reaction, the nitrate is the nitrate of another metal. So I think each reaction involves a metal being oxidized (losing electrons) and the corresponding metal in the nitrate being reduced (gaining electrons).

So for each reaction, I need to determine whether the metal on the left (reactant) can oxidize the nitrate's metal on the right. That is, if the metal on the left has a lower E°, it's more likely to be oxidized, meaning the other metal's ion (from nitrate) will be reduced.

Let me go through each option.

Option A: Fe(s) + 2 KNO3(aq) → 2 K(s) + Fe(NO3)2(aq)
So Fe is oxidized to Fe²+, and K+ in KNO3 is reduced to K(s). Wait, but K+ has a high E° (like -2.93 V) because K is very active. So Fe's E° as Fe²+/Fe is -0.44 V. Since K+ has a higher E° (more positive), it would tend to be reduced. But wait, no, because if K+ is being reduced, that would require a lower E° than Fe's? Or wait, the higher E° would be the one that's more likely to be reduced. So if K+ has a higher E° than Fe²+/Fe, then K+ would be the oxidizing agent, and Fe would be oxidized.

Wait, no. Wait, the E° for K+ is higher (more positive) than Fe²+/Fe. So K+ would be more likely to gain electrons (be reduced), which would mean Fe(s) would be oxidized to Fe²+. So this reaction could happen because K+ has a higher E° than Fe²+/Fe. So A is possible.

Option B: Mg(s) + 2 KNO3(aq) → 2 K(s) + Mg(NO3)2(aq)
Mg is oxidized to Mg²+, and K+ is reduced to K(s). Mg's E° is -2.37 V, K+ is -2.93 V. Wait, K+ has a lower E° than Mg²+? Wait no, wait: The E° for K+ is the reduction potential, so K+ + e- → K(s) is -2.93 V. Mg²+ + 2e- → Mg(s) is -2.37 V. So the E° for Mg²+ is higher (less negative) than K+. So Mg²+ has a higher E°, meaning it's a better oxidizing agent. But wait, in this reaction, K+ is being reduced. So if K+ has a lower E° than Mg²+, that would mean Mg²+ is a better oxidizing agent. Wait, but in this reaction, K+ is being reduced, which would require that K+ has a higher E° than Mg²+? Because the substance with higher E° is more likely to be reduced.

Wait, wait, no. Let me think again. The E° for K+ is -2.93 V, and for Mg²+ it's -2.37 V. So Mg²+ has a higher E° (since -2.37 > -2.93). So Mg²+ is a better oxidizing agent than K+ because it has a higher E°. That means Mg²+ would be more likely to gain electrons (be reduced) compared to K+. But in this reaction, K+ is being reduced. So for Mg(s) to oxidize K+ to K(s), the E° of K+ must be higher (more positive) than Mg²+/Mg. Because if K+ has a higher E°, it would tend to be reduced, so Mg would oxidize.

Wait, but K+ is at -2.93 and Mg²+ is at -2.37. So Mg²+ has higher E°. So Mg²+ would be more likely to be reduced than K+. So in this case, Mg(s) is being oxidized to Mg²+, which would require that the K+ in solution is more likely to be reduced. But since Mg²+ has a higher E°, it's a better oxidizing agent than K+. So K+ would not be reduced because Mg²+ is a better oxidizing agent. So this reaction (B) is not likely to occur because Mg(s) is less likely to oxidize K+; instead, Mg²+ would be the oxidizing agent.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this backwards. Let me think again. In a redox reaction, the stronger oxidizing agent (higher E°) will be reduced. The stronger reducing agent (lower E°) will be oxidized.

So in reaction B, Mg(s) is the reducing agent, being oxidized to Mg²+. The oxidizing agent would be KNO3, so K+ is being reduced to K(s). For this to happen, K+ must have a higher E° than Mg²+. But K+ is at -2.93, Mg²+ is at -2.37. So Mg²+ has a higher E°. That means Mg²+ is a stronger oxidizing agent than K+. Therefore, Mg²+ would tend to be reduced, not K+. So K+ is not a strong enough oxidizing agent to oxidize Mg(s). Therefore, reaction B is not likely to occur.

Option C: Pb(s) + Ca(NO3)2(aq) → Ca(s) + Pb(NO3)2(aq)
Pb(s) is oxidized to Pb²+; Ca²+ in Ca(NO3)2 is reduced to Ca(s). The E° for Pb²+/Pb is -0.13 V, and for Ca²+/Ca it's -2.98 V. Wait, no, wait: Ca²+ + 2e- → Ca(s) has E° = -2.98 V. Pb²+ + 2e- → Pb(s) is E° = -0.13 V. So Pb²+ has a higher E° than Ca²+. So Pb²+ is a stronger oxidizing agent than Ca²+. Therefore, Pb(s) is more likely to be oxidized than Ca²+ is to be reduced. Wait, no: in this reaction, Pb(s) is being oxidized (to Pb²+) and Ca²+ is being reduced to Ca(s). So for that to happen, the oxidizing agent (Ca²+) must have a higher E° than the reducing agent (Pb²+). Wait, no: the oxidizing agent is the one being reduced. So the oxidizing agent here is Ca²+, which must have a higher E° than Pb²+ for it to be reduced.

But Ca²+ has E° = -2.98 V, which is lower than Pb²+’s E° of -0.13 V. So Ca²+ has a lower E°, meaning it's a weaker oxidizing agent. Therefore, it's less likely that Ca²+ will be reduced. So Pb(s) would not be oxidized by Ca²+ because Ca²+ is a weaker oxidizing agent. So this reaction (C) is not likely to occur.

Option D: Zn(s) + 2 AgNO3(aq) → 2 Ag(s) + Zn(NO3)2(aq)
Zn is oxidized to Zn²+; Ag+ is reduced to Ag(s). E° for Zn²+/Zn is -0.76 V; for Ag+/Ag, it's 0.80 V. So Ag+ has a much higher E°, so it's a strong oxidizing agent. Thus, Ag+ will be reduced, and Zn will be oxidized. So this reaction is likely to occur because Zn has a lower E°, making it a better reducing agent. So D is a possible reaction.

Option E: Pb(s) + 2 LiNO3(aq) → 2 Li(s) + Pb(NO3)2(aq)
Pb(s) is oxidized to Pb²+; Li+ is reduced to Li(s). E° for Pb²+/Pb is -0.13 V; for Li+/Li, it's -3.04 V. So Li+ has a lower E°, meaning it's a weaker oxidizing agent. Since Pb²+ has a higher E° than Li+, Pb(s) would be oxidized only if Li+ is a better oxidizing agent, which it's not. So this reaction (E) is not likely to occur because Li+ can't oxidize Pb(s) to Pb²+; Pb(s) is a better reducing agent than Li, so Li+ would not be reduced.

Option F: Zn(s) + 2 Cu(NO3)(aq) → 2 Cu(s) + Zn(NO3)2(aq)
Zn is oxidized to Zn²+; Cu²+ is reduced to Cu(s). E° for Zn²+/Zn is -0.76 V; for Cu²+/Cu, it's 0.34 V. So Cu²+ has a higher E°, so it's a better oxidizing agent. Therefore, Cu²+ will be reduced, and Zn will be oxidized. This reaction is feasible. So F is a possible reaction.

Option G: Al(s) + 2 Mg(NO3)(aq) → 2 Mg(s) + Al(NO3)3(aq)
Al is oxidized to Al³+; Mg²+ is reduced to Mg(s). E° for Al³+/Al is -1.66 V; for Mg²+/Mg, it's -2.37 V. So Mg²+ has a lower E°. So for Mg²+ to be reduced, it would need to have a higher E° than Al³+/Al. But Mg²+ is lower, so Mg²+ is a weaker oxidizing agent than Al³+. So Al(s) is more likely to be oxidized, but wait, wait: in this reaction, Mg²+ is being reduced. So the oxidizing agent is Mg²+, which must have a higher E° than Al³+/Al. Since Mg²+ has E° = -2.37 V, which is lower than Al's -1.66 V. So Mg²+ cannot oxidize Al(s) because Mg²+ is a weaker oxidizing agent than Al³+. Thus, G is not likely to occur.

Option H: Al(s) + 3 NaNO3(aq) → 3 Na(s) + Al(NO3)3(aq)
Al is oxidized to Al³+; Na+ is reduced to Na(s). E° for Al³+/Al is -1.66 V; Na+/Na is E° = -2.71 V (I think, but I might be mixing up values; I'll go with -2.71 V as an example). So Na+ has a lower E°, so it's a weaker oxidizing agent than Al³+. Thus, Al(s) would not be oxidized by Na+ because Na+ can't act as a strong enough oxidizing agent. So H is not likely to occur.

Option I: Ni(s) + 2 LiNO3(aq) → 2 Li(s) + Ni(NO3)2(aq)
Ni(s) is oxidized to Ni²+; Li+ is reduced to Li(s). E° for Ni²+/Ni is around -0.23 V (I think it's actually -0.28 V); for Li+/Li, it's -3.04 V. So Li+ has a lower E°. Therefore, Li+ can't be reduced because Ni²+ has a higher E°. So Ni(s) would not be oxidized by Li+ because Li+ is a weaker oxidizing agent. So I is not likely to occur.

Now, from all the options, the reactions that are likely to occur are D and F because in those cases, the oxidizing agent has a higher E° than the reducing agent.

Wait, let me double-check D and F.

In D: Zn(s) reacts with AgNO3. Zn's E° is -0.76 V, Ag's is 0.80 V. So Ag+ is a strong oxidizing agent, so it reduces, Zn oxidizes. So D is feasible.

In F: Zn reacts with Cu(NO3)2. Cu's E° is higher (0.34) than Zn's (-0.76). So Cu²+ reduces, Zn oxidizes. So F is also feasible.

Wait, but both D and F are possible. The question is asking which is most likely to occur based on E°. So I need to see which of these has a higher E° difference, making it more favorable.

The cell potential (E°cell) is E°cathode - E°anode. For D: E°cathode (Ag) is 0.80 V, E°anode (Zn) is -0.76 V. So E°cell = 0.80 - (-0.76) = 1.56 V.

For F: E°cathode (Cu) is 0.34 V, E°anode (Zn) is -0.76. So E°cell = 0.34 - (-0.76) = 1.10 V.

So D has a higher E°cell, making it more spontaneous. Therefore, D is more likely than F.

Wait, but wait: the question is which is "most likely to occur", so D and F are both possible, but D is more favorable.

Looking back at the options, the choices are D and F. So which is correct?

Wait, but in the options, D is Zn + 2 AgNO3 → 2 Ag + Zn(NO3)2.

And F is Zn + 2 Cu(NO3) → 2 Cu + Zn(NO3)2.

So both are possible, but D is more likely because the E°cell is higher, making it more spontaneous.

Wait, but the options are given as A to I, and the user is to choose the correct letter.

Wait, but in the options, I think I might have made a mistake with the E° for Ni. Let me confirm some E° values again.

Wait, for Ni²+ + 2e- → Ni(s) is E° = -0.23 V, and for Cu²+ + 2e- → Cu(s) is E° = 0.34 V.

So in F, Cu²+ has higher E°, so yes, it would be reduced.

In D, Ag+ has higher E°, so it's reduced.

So among the options, both D and F are possible, but the question is which is most likely. Since D has a higher E°cell, it's more likely to occur.

Wait, but looking back at the options, I think I might have missed something else. Let me check all the options again.

Wait, the options for D and F: Are the products correct? For F, the product is Zn(NO3)2, which makes sense because Zn is going to Zn²+. And for Cu(NO3), which is Cu(NO3)2? Wait, the formula might be a typo. But assuming it's correct, the reaction is feasible.

But wait, in the options, F is written as Zn(s) + 2 Cu(NO3)(aq) → 2 Cu(s) + Zn(NO3)2(aq). So the nitrate is from Cu, so it's Cu(NO3)2, perhaps? Or is it a typo? Maybe it's Cu(NO3)2, but the formula is written as Cu(NO3), which could be a mistake. But assuming it's Cu(NO3)2, then it's correct.

So, considering all that, the reactions in D and F are both possible. But the question is which is most likely to occur, so the one with the higher E°cell would be more favorable.

So D has E°cell of 1.56 V, F has 1.10 V. So D is more likely.

Wait, but looking back, the options given, are there any other possibilities? Let's see.

Wait, another approach: the more positive the E°, the more likely the reaction. So the reaction where the oxidizing agent's E° is higher than the reducing agent's will occur.

So for D: Ag+ has E°=0.80, Zn²+ has -0.76. So Ag+ is better oxidizing agent.

For F: Cu²+ has 0.34, Zn²+ has -0.76. Cu²+ is better.

So both are possible, but D is more feasible because of higher E°cell.

But wait, the question is which is "most likely to occur", so D is a better option.

Wait, but looking back at the options, I think I might have made a mistake with E° for Fe. Let me check that again.

Wait, in option A: Fe(s) reacts with KNO3. K+ has E°=-2.93, Fe²+ has -0.44. So K+ has a lower E°, meaning Fe²+ is a stronger oxidizing agent than K+. So Fe²+ would be reduced, but K+ is being reduced. Wait, no: wait, in A, K+ is being reduced to K(s), and Fe(s) is oxidized to Fe²+. So for K+ to be reduced, its E° must be higher than Fe²+/Fe. But K+ is at -2.93, Fe²+ is at -0.44. So Fe²+ has higher E°, so Fe²+ is a stronger oxidizing agent than K+. That means Fe²+ would be more likely to be reduced than K+. So K+ wouldn't be reduced in this case because Fe²+ is a stronger oxidizing agent. So reaction A is not likely to occur.

Wait, that's conflicting with my earlier thought. Let me clarify:

If Fe(s) is reacting with KNO3, then Fe is oxidized to Fe²+, and K+ is reduced to K(s). For K+ to be reduced, it must have a higher E° than Fe²+/Fe. Because the substance with higher E° is more likely to be reduced.

So K+ E°: -2.93 V.

Fe²+/Fe: -0.44 V.

Since -0.44 > -2.93, Fe²+ has higher E°. So Fe²+ is a better oxidizing agent than K+. Therefore, Fe²+ would be reduced, not K+. So K+ would not be reduced because Fe²+ is a stronger oxidizing agent. Hence, reaction A is not possible.

So going back to the options, the only reactions that are possible are D and F, with D being more favorable.

Wait, but the question is which is "most likely to occur", so D is the best option.

Wait, but let me check the options again. The problem is that in option D, the product is Zn(NO3)2, but the reactant is AgNO3. So Zn is oxidized, Ag is reduced.

Wait, but looking back, I think I made a mistake in the E° for Ag. Let me confirm:

Ag+ + e- → Ag(s): E° = +0.80 V.

Zn²+ + 2e- → Zn(s): E° = -0.76 V.

So the E°cell is E°cathode (Ag) - E°anode (Zn) = 0.80 - (-0.76) = 1.56 V. Positive, so reaction is spontaneous.

Similarly, for F: Cu²+ + 2e- → Cu(s): E°=0.34 V.

Zn²+ + 2e- → Zn(s): E°=-0.76 V.

E°cell = 0.34 - (-0.76) = 1.10 V. Also positive, so reaction is spontaneous.

So both D and F are possible, but D is more favorable.

Wait, but the options don't have both D and F as correct. The question is a single choice, so perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating other options.

Wait, perhaps I should check option I again.

Option I: Ni(s) + 2 LiNO3 → 2 Li(s) + Ni(NO3)2.

Ni's E° is around -0.23 V, Li+ at -3.04 V. So Li+ has lower E°, so can't be reduced. So Ni(s) won't oxidize Li+.

So, back to the options, the possible reactions are D and F. But which is the correct answer among the options?

Wait, the options are given as D and F. So perhaps the intended answer is D.

Alternatively, perhaps I missed something else. Let me think again.

Wait, another thing to consider: the activity of ions. But I think the question is based purely on standard E° values.

So, considering all, the correct answer should be D and F, but since the question asks which is most likely, D is more favorable.

Wait, but looking back, the options are:

D: Zn(s) + 2 AgNO3(aq) → 2 Ag(s) + Zn(NO3)2(aq)

F: Zn(s) + 2 Cu(NO3)(aq) → 2 Cu(s) + Zn(NO3)2(aq)

So both reactions are possible, but D is more favorable because the E°cell is higher.

But the question is which is "most likely", so perhaps the intended answer is D.

Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in E° for some metals. Let me confirm some E° values again.

From standard tables:

- Li+ + e- → Li: E° = -3.04 V
- K+ + e- → K: E° = -2.93 V
- Ba²+ + 2e- → Ba: E° = -2.98 V
- Mg²+ + 2e- → Mg: E° = -2.37 V
- Al³+ + 3e- → Al: E° = -1.66 V
- Zn²+ + 2e- → Zn: E° = -0.76 V
- Fe²+ + 2e- → Fe: E° = -0.44 V
- Pb²+ + 2e- → Pb: E° = -0.13 V
- Ni²+ + 2e- → Ni: E° = -0.23 V
- Cu²+ + 2e- → Cu: E° = 0.34 V
- Ag+ + e- → Ag: E° = 0.80 V

So yes, the values I used earlier are correct.

Thus, in the options, D and F are possible, but D is more favorable.

Wait, but the question is multiple choice, and I have to choose the correct option from A to I.

Wait, but looking at the options, perhaps I missed something else. Let me check option H again.

Option H: Al(s) + 3 NaNO3 → 3 Na(s) + Al(NO3)3.

Al is oxidized to Al³+; Na+ is reduced to Na(s). E° for Al³+/Al is -1.66 V; Na+/Na is -2.71 V (I think I might have gotten that wrong earlier; perhaps it's -2.71 V? I'm not entirely sure, but let's assume it's around there).

So Na+ has E°=-2.71 V, which is lower than Al's -1.66 V. So Na+ cannot be reduced because Al³+ is a stronger oxidizing agent. So Al(s) would not be oxidized by Na+; instead, Na+ would be oxidized, but that's not the case here. So reaction H is not possible.

So, back to the main options, D and F are possible. But looking at the options, perhaps the correct answer is option D.

Wait, but in the options, I think I might have made a mistake. Let me check each option again quickly.

Option D: Zn + 2 AgNO3 → 2 Ag + Zn(NO3)2.

This is a classic reaction where Zn displaces Ag because Ag is less active. So this reaction is known to occur.

Option F: Zn + 2 Cu(NO3) → 2 Cu + Zn(NO3)2.

This is also a known reaction because Cu is more noble than Zn.

But between the two, D is more favorable because Ag has a higher E°, making the reaction more spontaneous.

So, the correct answer should be D.
</think>

To determine which reaction is most likely to occur based on oxidation-reduction potentials, we analyze the standard reduction potentials (E°) of the metals involved. The substance with a higher E° is more likely to be reduced, while the substance with a lower E° is more likely to be oxidized. The feasibility of a reaction depends on whether the oxidizing agent (with higher E°) can reduce the reducing agent (with lower E°).

### Analysis of Each Option:

1. **Option A**:  
   Fe(s) + 2 KNO₃(aq) → 2 K(s) + Fe(NO₃)₂(aq)  
   - Fe is oxidized to Fe²⁺ (E° = -0.44 V), and K⁺ is reduced to K(s) (E° = -2.93 V).  
   - Since Fe²⁺ has a higher E° than K⁺, Fe is more likely to be reduced, and K⁺ is less likely to be reduced.  
   - **Reaction is not likely to occur**.

2. **Option B**:  
   Mg(s) + 2 KNO₃(aq) → 2 K(s) + Mg(NO₃)₂(aq)  
   - Mg is oxidized to Mg²⁺ (E° = -2.37 V), and K⁺ is reduced to K(s) (E° = -2.93 V).  
   - Mg²⁺ has a higher E° than K⁺, so Mg is more likely to be reduced, and K⁺ is less likely to be reduced.  
   - **Reaction is not likely to occur**.

3. **Option C**:  
   Pb(s) + Ca(NO₃)₂(aq) → Ca(s) + Pb(NO₃)₂(aq)  
   - Pb is oxidized to Pb²⁺ (E° = -0.13 V), and Ca²⁺ is reduced to Ca(s) (E° = -2.98 V).  
   - Pb²⁺ has a higher E° than Ca²⁺, so Pb is more likely to be reduced, and Ca²⁺ is less likely to be reduced.  
   - **Reaction is not likely to occur**.

4. **Option D**:  
   Zn(s) + 2 AgNO₃(aq) → 2 Ag(s) + Zn(NO₃)₂(aq)  
   - Zn is oxidized to Zn²⁺ (E° = -0.76 V), and Ag⁺ is reduced to Ag(s) (E° = 0.80 V).  
   - Ag⁺ has a much higher E° than Zn²⁺, so this reaction is highly favorable.  
   - **Reaction is likely to occur**.

5. **Option E**:  
   Pb(s) + 2 LiNO₃(aq) → 2 Li(s) + Pb(NO₃)₂(aq)  
   - Pb is oxidized to Pb²⁺ (E° = -0.13 V), and Li⁺ is reduced to Li(s) (E° = -3.04 V).  
   - Pb²⁺ has a higher E° than Li⁺, so Pb is more likely to be reduced, and Li⁺ is less likely to be reduced.  
   - **Reaction is not likely to occur**.

6. **Option F**:  
   Zn(s) + 2 Cu(NO₃)(aq) → 2 Cu(s) + Zn(NO₃)₂(aq)  
   - Zn is oxidized to Zn²⁺ (E° = -0.76 V), and Cu²⁺ is reduced to Cu(s) (E° = 0.34 V).  
   - Cu²⁺ has a higher E° than Zn²⁺, so this reaction is feasible.  
   - **Reaction is likely to occur**.

7. **Option G**:  
   Al(s) + 2 Mg(NO₃)(aq) → 2 Mg(s) + Al(NO₃)₃(aq)  
   - Al is oxidized to Al³⁺ (E° = -1.66 V), and Mg²⁺ is reduced to Mg(s) (E° = -2.37 V).  
   - Mg²⁺ has a lower E° than Al³⁺, so Mg²⁺ is less likely to be reduced.  
   - **Reaction is not likely to occur**.

8. **Option H**:  
   Al(s) + 3 NaNO₃(aq) → 3 Na(s) + Al(NO₃)₃(aq)  
   - Al is oxidized to Al³⁺ (E° = -1.66 V), and Na⁺ is reduced to Na(s) (E° = -2.71 V).  
   - Al³⁺ has a higher E° than Na⁺, so Al is more likely to be reduced, and Na⁺ is less likely to be reduced.  
   - **Reaction is not likely to occur**.

9. **Option I**:  
   Ni(s) + 2 LiNO₃(aq) → 2 Li(s) + Ni(NO₃)₂(aq)  
   - Ni is oxidized to Ni²⁺ (E° = -0.23 V), and Li⁺ is reduced to Li(s) (E° = -3.04 V).  
   - Ni²⁺ has a higher E° than Li⁺, so Ni is more likely to be reduced, and Li⁺ is less likely to be reduced.  
   - **Reaction is not likely to occur**.

### Conclusion:
The reactions in **Option D** and **Option F** are both feasible, but **Option D** is more favorable because the cell potential (E°cell) is higher (1.56 V compared to 1.10 V in F). Therefore, **Option D** is the most likely to occur.

**Answer: D**
