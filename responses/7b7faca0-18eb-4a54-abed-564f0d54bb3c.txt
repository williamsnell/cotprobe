Okay, so I have this question here, and I need to figure out which expression represents the phrase "3 fewer than a number, p." Let me break it down step by step.

First, I know that "fewer than" usually means subtraction. So if something is 3 fewer than p, it should be p minus 3. Let me think about that. For example, if p is 10, then 3 fewer would be 7, which is 10 - 3. So that makes sense.

Now, looking at the options, I need to find which one is p minus 3. Let me go through each option quickly.

Option A is p%3. Hmm, the % usually means modulo, which gives the remainder when p is divided by 3. That doesn't fit because we're talking about fewer, not a remainder.

Option B is p+3. That's adding 3, but the question is about fewer, so subtraction, not addition. So B is out.

Option C is 3^p, which is 3 raised to the power of p. That's exponential, not subtraction, so no.

Option D is p-3. That's exactly what I was thinking earlier. That seems correct.

Option E is 3/p, which is 3 divided by p. Not subtraction, so not the right choice.

Option F is p^3, which is p cubed. Again, exponentiation, not subtraction.

Option G is p*3, which is multiplication. That's not what we need here.

Option H is 3*p, same as G, just written differently. Still multiplication, so nope.

Option I is 3-p, which is the same as -(p-3). So it's negative of p-3. If p is 10, this would be -7, which is 3 fewer than 10 but expressed as a negative number. But the phrase "3 fewer than p" is p-3, not 3-p. So I think D is better.

Option J is p/3, which is division, not subtraction.

So after going through all the options, D: p-3 seems to be the correct answer. It directly translates to 3 fewer than the number p.

The phrase "3 fewer than a number, p" translates to p minus 3. Among the options, D: p-3 correctly represents this expression.

Answer: D
