Question:

A scientist using mouse models to determine the response of blood hormones to large levels of glucose in the body discovers a new hormone not previously described. According to his data, this hormone is found both inside and out of cells when carrying out its function, increase the amount of nucleic acid in the cell while functioning, and are derived from a structure containing four hydroxycarbon rings. This will likely be categorized as which type of hormone?

Options:

A: Lipid-based
B: Eicosanoid
C: Glycoprotein
D: Enzymatic
E: Protein-based
F: Carbohydrate-based
G: Nucleic acid-based
H: Steroid
I: Amino acid
J: Peptide

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this hormone question. Let's break it down step by step.

The question says a scientist found a new hormone in mouse models. The hormone does a few things: it's found both inside and outside cells when it's functioning, it increases the amount of nucleic acid in the cell while working, and it's derived from a structure with four hydroxycarbon rings. Hmm, I need to figure out what category this hormone falls into.

First, let's consider where the hormone is found. It's both inside and outside the cells. That makes me think it's probably a hormone that's secreted into the bloodstream, so it's likely a circulating hormone, not something that's strictly intracellular. But wait, steroids are hydrophobic and can pass through cell membranes, so they can be inside and outside. Other hormones like proteins are usually outside, but maybe some can get in too.

Next, the hormone increases nucleic acid in the cell. Nucleic acids are DNA and RNA. If a hormone increases these, maybe it's stimulating cell division or gene expression. Steroids like glucocorticoids can influence gene expression, so that's a possibility. Alternatively, some protein-based hormones might do that too, but let me think about the other clues.

The third clue is that it's derived from a structure with four hydroxycarbon rings. Four rings... that sounds a lot like a steroid structure. Steroids have four fused rings, each with hydroxyl groups (the hydroxy part) and carbon chains. So this points towards a steroid hormone. Examples include cortisol, estrogen, testosterone, etc.

Let me cross-check the other options. Lipid-based hormones would include steroids and eicosanoids. Eicosanoids are derived from arachidonic acid, which is a 20-carbon fatty acid, and they form structures like prostaglandins, leukotrienes, etc. They don't have four rings like steroids. So maybe not eicosanoid.

Protein-based hormones are things like insulin, growth hormone. They are usually large molecules, circulate in blood, and are synthesized by ribosomes. They wouldn't have the four-ring structure. Glycoproteins are also protein-based with carbohydrate parts, so same category as proteins.

Carbohydrate-based hormones are less common. I know plants have things like invertase, but in animals, maybe not so much. Same with amino acid-based, which would be like amines or amino acid derivatives, but those are usually small and not four rings.

Nucleic acid-based hormones don't make sense because hormones aren't made of DNA or RNA. Enzymatic is about enzymes, which are proteins, but the question is about a hormone, not an enzyme.

So putting it together: derived from four hydroxycarbon rings (steroid), found inside and outside (steroids can pass through cell membranes), and increasing nucleic acid (which steroids can do by influencing gene expression). Therefore, the answer should be H: Steroid.

The hormone in question is derived from a structure with four hydroxycarbon rings, which is characteristic of steroids. Steroids can be found both inside and outside cells and can influence processes like nucleic acid synthesis by affecting gene expression. Therefore, the hormone is likely a steroid.

Answer: H
