Okay, so I have this problem about markup percentage based on the selling price. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

The dress sells for $50.00, and the markup is 40% based on the selling price. I need to find the markup in dollars. Hmm, markup is the amount added to the cost to get the selling price, right? But wait, the markup is given as a percentage of the selling price, not the cost. That might be a bit tricky.

So, the formula for markup percentage based on selling price is: Markup = (Markup Percentage × Selling Price). Since the markup percentage is 40%, I can calculate this by converting 40% to a decimal, which is 0.4.

Let me compute that: 0.4 × $50.00. So, 0.4 times 50 is... 0.4 * 50 = 20. So the markup should be $20.00. 

Wait, but sometimes markup is calculated based on cost, not selling price. Let me double-check because I might be mixing things up. If it's based on cost, the formula would be different. But the question specifically says it's based on the selling price, so I think my initial calculation is correct.

So, the markup is $20.00, which corresponds to option G.

The markup is calculated as 40% of the selling price of $50.00. Converting 40% to a decimal (0.4) and multiplying by $50 gives a markup of $20.00.
