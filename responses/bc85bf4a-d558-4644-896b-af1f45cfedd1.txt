Question:

In which of the following situations would the defendant's intoxication NOT be able to negate his criminal culpability?

Options:

A: A defendant had been drinking liquor all evening at a bar with three of his buddies. An undercover detective overheard the defendant and his buddies plot to rob the bar after closing hours. When the defendant attempted to draw a gun from his coat, he was quickly disarmed and placed under arrest by the detective. The defendant is charged with the crime of conspiracy to commit robbery.
B: After consuming a large amount of alcohol at a party, a defendant decided to set a neighbor's car on fire out of spite. He was seen by witnesses and later arrested and charged with arson.
C: A defendant had been drinking at a local pub and got into a heated argument with another patron. The argument escalated, and the defendant pulled out a pocket knife and stabbed the other patron. The defendant is arrested and charged with attempted murder.
D: A defendant had consumed a fifth of bourbon. Later that same day, he approached a victim and, brandishing a knife, told her to accompany him or he would stab her. He led the victim to his car and then ordered her to disrobe. As the victim was removing her pantyhose, she kicked the defendant in the head, temporarily dazing him. The victim then safely ran from the car. The defendant is arrested and charged with the crime of assault with the intent to commit rape.
E: A defendant spent the evening drinking at a bar. On his way home, he broke into a house, intending to steal valuables. However, he fell asleep on the couch before he could steal anything. He was discovered by the homeowners and arrested and charged with attempted robbery.
F: At his law school graduation party, a defendant drank two six-packs of beer. Around midnight, the defendant was approached by a girl, who asked him to drive her home. Although the girl was only 15 years old, she had the appearance of a woman in her mid-to-late twenties. The defendant, who had had his eye on the girl all night, quickly agreed, and he showed her the way to his car. Once inside, they engaged in sexual intercourse. The age of consent in this jurisdiction is 17 years old for females. The defendant is subsequently arrested and charged with statutory rape.
G: A defendant was drinking at a bar when he noticed a woman leave her purse unattended. He stole the purse and was later arrested and charged with theft.
H: A defendant attended a wedding reception at a hotel, where he drank several vodka daiquiris. Following the reception, the defendant engaged in a violent argument with the hotel's parking lot attendant. The defendant took a tire iron from his car and threw it at the attendant. The tire iron missed the attendant and hit a victim as he was entering the hotel. The defendant is arrested and charged with assault with the intent to commit battery.
I: A defendant had been drinking heavily at a friend's house. Later that evening, he decided to drive home despite being significantly over the legal blood alcohol limit. On the way, he ran a red light and hit a pedestrian who was crossing the street. The defendant is arrested and charged with vehicular manslaughter.
J: After a night of heavy drinking, a defendant broke into a jewelry store and stole several expensive items. He was caught on the store's surveillance cameras and later arrested and charged with burglary.

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about criminal law, specifically regarding whether a defendant's intoxication can negate their criminal culpability. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question is asking in which situation the defendant's intoxication would NOT be able to negate his criminal culpability. That means I need to find the option where intoxication doesn't serve as a defense, so the defendant is still guilty.

From what I remember, in criminal law, voluntary intoxication can sometimes be a defense, but it depends on the type of crime. For specific intent crimes, voluntary intoxication can sometimes negate the specific intent, thus reducing the charge or exonerating the defendant. However, for general intent crimes, voluntary intoxication isn't a defense.

Specific intent crimes require the defendant to have a particular intent beyond just the act. Examples include crimes like first-degree murder (premeditation), burglary (intent to commit a felony inside), larceny, etc. General intent crimes just require the intent to commit the act, like assault, battery, or manslaughter.

So, the key is to determine whether each option's crime is specific or general intent.

Let's go through each option:

Option A: Conspiracy to commit robbery. Conspiracy is a specific intent crime because it requires the intent to agree and the intent to commit the underlying crime. However, wait, I think conspiracy is considered a general intent crime in some jurisdictions, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the specific intent is to commit the robbery, so if the defendant was too intoxicated to form that intent, it could negate the conspiracy. But I'm not certain.

Option B: Arson. Arson typically requires the intent to damage property by fire, which is specific intent. So if the defendant was too intoxicated to form that intent, he could use it as a defense. But wait, in some places, arson is considered a general intent crime. I'm a bit confused here.

Option C: Attempted murder. Murder is a specific intent crime because it requires malice aforethought. Attempted murder would require the intent to commit murder. So if the defendant was too intoxicated to form that intent, he might not be guilty. But wait, I think for attempt, the specific intent to commit the underlying crime is needed, so intoxication could negate that. However, some jurisdictions might treat it differently.

Option D: Assault with intent to commit rape. Assault is generally a general intent crime, but if it's with the specific intent to commit rape, then it's specific. So if the defendant was too drunk to form the intent to rape, he might not be guilty. But wait, if the assault was the act, and the intent was just to commit the assault, maybe it's general. Hmm, getting a bit tangled here.

Option E: Attempted robbery. Robbery is a specific intent crime because it involves taking property with the intent to permanently deprive. So if the defendant was too intoxicated to form that intent, he could use it as a defense. But since he fell asleep, maybe he didn't form the intent, so intoxication would negate it.

Option F: Statutory rape. Statutory rape is a strict liability crime in many jurisdictions because it doesn't require intentâ€”just the act and the age. So voluntary intoxication wouldn't be a defense here because intent isn't required. The defendant knew or should have known the girl's age, but intoxication doesn't negate strict liability.

Option G: Theft. Theft is a specific intent crime because it requires the intent to permanently deprive the owner of property. If the defendant was too intoxicated to form that intent, he might not be guilty. But if the crime is considered general intent, then intoxication wouldn't help. I think theft is specific intent, so intoxication could negate it.

Option H: Assault with intent to commit battery. Battery is typically a general intent crime, but if the intent is to commit battery specifically, maybe it's specific. Alternatively, if the defendant intended to throw the tire iron, which caused battery, then maybe the intent is general. So if he was too drunk to form that intent, it might help, but I'm not sure.

Option I: Vehicular manslaughter. Manslaughter, especially involuntary manslaughter, is generally a general intent crime. It's about causing death through criminal negligence. So voluntary intoxication wouldn't negate that because it's about the act, not the specific intent.

Option J: Burglary. Burglary is a specific intent crime because it requires the intent to commit a felony inside the structure. So if the defendant was too intoxicated to form that intent, he might not be guilty.

Wait, the question is about when intoxication cannot negate culpability. So, the correct answer would be when the crime is strict liability or when intoxication isn't a defense.

Looking back, statutory rape (Option F) is a strict liability crime. So voluntary intoxication can't be used as a defense because the crime doesn't require specific intent. Similarly, in some jurisdictions, crimes like battery or manslaughter are general intent, so intoxication doesn't help.

But the question is about which situation the intoxication cannot negate. So, the correct answer is F because statutory rape doesn't require intent, so intoxication can't be used as a defense.

Wait, but looking again, Option F says the defendant was charged with statutory rape. The age of consent is 17, and the girl was 15. Statutory rape is strict liability, so the defendant's intoxication doesn't matter. He's liable regardless of his intoxication.

So, the answer should be F.

The correct answer is **F**. Statutory rape is a strict liability crime, meaning it does not require the defendant to have a specific intent. Voluntary intoxication cannot negate the criminal culpability in such cases because the crime is defined by the act itself, regardless of the defendant's mental state.
