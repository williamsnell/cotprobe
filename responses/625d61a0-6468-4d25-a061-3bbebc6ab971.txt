Okay, so I've got this math problem here that I need to solve. It's a multiplication of three complex numbers: (i + 1)(5 – 5i)(5 + 5i). And I have to choose the correct answer from options A to J. Hmm, let's break this down step by step. 

First, I remember that when multiplying complex numbers, especially those with conjugates, there might be a shortcut. The terms (5 – 5i) and (5 + 5i) look like complex conjugates. I think their product should be a real number because the imaginary parts cancel out. Let me calculate that first to make things easier.

So, (5 – 5i)(5 + 5i) is a product of conjugates. The formula for that is (a - b)(a + b) = a² - b². Applying that here, a is 5 and b is 5i. So it's 5² minus (5i)². 

Calculating that: 5 squared is 25, and (5i) squared is 25i². Since i² is -1, that becomes 25*(-1) = -25. So subtracting that from 25 gives 25 - (-25) which is 25 +25 = 50. So the product of the second and third terms is 50.

Now the original expression simplifies to (i + 1) multiplied by 50. So (i + 1)*50. Let's distribute that. 50 times i is 50i, and 50 times 1 is 50. So adding those together gives 50 +50i.

Wait, but let me double-check that because sometimes I might make a mistake with the signs. Let me go through the multiplication again. 

Alternatively, maybe expanding all three terms step by step would be better to avoid any mistakes. Let me try that approach.

First, multiply (i + 1) with (5 –5i). Let's distribute each term. 

(i)*(5) = 5i
(i)*(-5i) = -5i²
1*(5) =5
1*(-5i) = -5i

So adding those together: 5i -5i² +5 -5i. Combine like terms. The 5i and -5i cancel each other out, leaving 5 -5i². Since i² is -1, that becomes 5 -5*(-1) =5 +5=10.

Wait, that's interesting. So (i+1)(5-5i) equals 10. Then I have to multiply that by (5 +5i). So 10*(5 +5i) =50 +50i. That matches what I got earlier. So the result is 50 +50i.

Looking back at the options, option C is 50 +50i. So that's the correct answer.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the first step. Because sometimes it's easy to miscalculate when dealing with complex numbers.

Alternatively, another approach is to multiply all three terms step by step, without grouping the conjugates first. Let me try that.

First, multiply (i +1) and (5 -5i). As I did before, that gives 10. Then multiply 10 by (5 +5i) to get 50 +50i. Yep, same result.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the FOIL method on all three terms, but that might be more complicated. Let me see: (i +1)(5 –5i)(5 +5i). Since two of the terms are conjugates, it's smarter to multiply those first, as I did, because it gives a real number, simplifying the rest of the calculation.

So, I'm confident that the answer is 50 +50i, which is option C.

The product (5–5i)(5+5i) is 50, and multiplying by (i+1) gives 50 +50i.
