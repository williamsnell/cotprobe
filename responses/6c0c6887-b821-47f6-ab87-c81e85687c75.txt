Question:

When it comes to STATISTICAL DECISION-MAKING, rejecting a false null is the goal of most researches. From your knowledge about TYPE I ERROR, which statement out of the following ones is about it?

Options:

A: null hypothesis is accepted, but it is false
B: the level of significance is set by the researcher at .01 or .05
C: graphically→ white is retention area and black is rejected area
D: probability of making a Beta Level error
E: null hypothesis is rejected, but it is true
F: null hypothesis is accepted, and it is true
G: null hypothesis is not rejected, but it is false
H: the level of significance is set by the researcher at .10 or .20
I: graphically→ black is retention area and white is rejected area

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about statistical decision-making, specifically focusing on Type I errors. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, I remember that in hypothesis testing, there are two main hypotheses: the null hypothesis (H0) and the alternative hypothesis (H1). The null hypothesis is the default assumption, and we test whether there's enough evidence to reject it in favor of the alternative.

Now, the question is about Type I errors. From what I recall, a Type I error occurs when we incorrectly reject a true null hypothesis. So, in other words, it's when our statistical test leads us to conclude that we should reject H0, but H0 was actually true. This is also known as a "false positive" result.

Looking at the options:

A: null hypothesis is accepted, but it is false. Hmm, that sounds like a Type II error, because accepting a false null means we failed to reject it when we should have. So A is about Type II.

B: level of significance set at .01 or .05. The level of significance (alpha) is the probability of making a Type I error. So B is talking about alpha, which relates to Type I, but it's not directly describing the error itself.

C: graphically, white is retention area and black is rejected area. I think the retention (or acceptance) area is where we fail to reject H0, and the rejection area is where we reject H0. The colors might represent these regions. If white is retention and black is rejection, this could be a graphical representation of the decision regions. But I'm not sure yet if this is about Type I error.

D: probability of making a Beta Level error. Beta is related to Type II errors, so D is about Type II, not Type I.

E: null hypothesis is rejected, but it is true. This is exactly the definition of a Type I error. So E seems correct.

F: null is accepted and it's true. That's a correct decision, not an error.

G: null is not rejected but it's false. That's a Type II error because we failed to reject a false null.

H: level of significance set at .10 or .20. Again, alpha relates to Type I, but the specific values here are just examples of alpha levels, not the error itself.

I: graphically, black is retention and white is rejected. Wait, that's the opposite of C. So if black is retention, that's where we don't reject H0, and white is where we reject. But how does this relate to Type I? The Type I error area would be in the rejection region where H0 is true. So if the rejection area is white, then any sample in white would lead to a Type I error if H0 is actually true. So I is about the graphical representation of the rejection regions but doesn't directly state it's a Type I error.

Wait, but the question is asking which statement is about Type I error. So looking back, E directly describes the scenario where we reject H0 when it's actually true, which is Type I. Options B and H are about alpha, which is the significance level set to control Type I errors. C and I are about graphical representations of the decision areas but don't explicitly state the error.

So the correct answer should be E.

The correct answer is E, as it directly describes the scenario of a Type I error, where the null hypothesis is rejected when it is actually true.

Answer: E
