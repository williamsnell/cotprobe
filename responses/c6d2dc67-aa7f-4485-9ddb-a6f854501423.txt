Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about a meta-analysis by Baltes and his colleagues from 1999 regarding the effects of flexitime in organizations. The question is asking which of the given options would likely have the greatest beneficial effects from instituting flexitime. 

First, I need to recall what flexitime is. Flexitime, or flexible working hours, typically allows employees to adjust their working hours within a framework, often giving them more control over when they start and finish work, as long as they meet core hours or complete their required tasks. The idea is to provide more work-life balance, which can have various effects on employees and the organization.

The options provided are:

A: job stress
B: communication within the organization
C: productivity
D: overall job satisfaction
E: self-rated performance
F: absenteeism
G: employee turnover
H: company profitability
I: teamwork

I remember that flexitime is often associated with reducing job stress because employees can manage their time better, avoiding rush hours or personal commitments. It might help in decreasing stress, which would make option A a possibility. However, I'm not sure if it's the greatest effect.

Looking at productivity (C), I think that flexible hours can sometimes lead to higher productivity because employees might work more efficiently when they're in a better mood or can work during their most productive times. But some studies suggest that without proper structure, productivity might not necessarily increase or could even decrease, so I'm not certain.

Overall job satisfaction (D) is another strong candidate. Flexibility is a key factor in job satisfaction; when employees feel they have control over their time, they tend to be more satisfied. This could lead to higher retention and better performance, but I'm not sure if it's the greatest effect compared to others.

Self-rated performance (E) is interesting. If employees feel they're performing better because of the flexibility, their self-ratings could improve. But this might be more of a secondary effect rather than the primary one.

Absenteeism (F) could decrease because employees might be less likely to call in sick if they have flexibility, but again, I'm not sure if this is the main beneficial effect.

Employee turnover (G) is another point. If employees are happier with their work-life balance, they might be less likely to leave, which would reduce turnover. But I'm not certain if this is the primary outcome the meta-analysis would highlight.

Company profitability (H) is a broader measure. While happy employees can contribute to profitability, the direct link might not be as clear as other factors.

Teamwork (I) might be affected, but I'm not sure how. Flexitime could either improve or hinder teamwork depending on how it's implemented. Maybe if teams can coordinate better with flexible hours, but this might vary.

Now, thinking about the meta-analysis by Baltes and colleagues (1999). I recall that meta-analyses often look for the most consistent and strongest effects across studies. From what I remember, job satisfaction is a common outcome in studies about work flexibility. Also, job stress reduction is a key benefit, but sometimes the greatest effect is on satisfaction rather than stress because satisfaction is a more comprehensive measure.

Wait, but sometimes productivity is the primary concern for organizations. If flexitime leads to higher productivity, that's a direct benefit. But I think productivity might not always increase; it can depend on the nature of the work. For example, in jobs that require collaboration, flexible hours might make coordination harder, potentially lowering productivity.

On the other hand, job satisfaction is something employees value highly. If flexitime leads to higher satisfaction, that could have a ripple effect on other variables like turnover and absenteeism. But the question is asking for the greatest beneficial effect, so which is more directly impacted.

I think I'm leaning towards job satisfaction (D) being the answer because providing flexibility is a key factor in employee satisfaction. But I'm trying to remember if productivity is more directly affected. Alternatively, maybe the meta-analysis found that productivity increases significantly with flexitime.

Wait, another angle: sometimes, when employees have more control over their time, they can manage their workload better, leading to higher productivity. But again, it's not always straightforward because if someone works longer hours, productivity might increase, but that's not necessarily better for work-life balance.

Alternatively, job stress (A) might be the answer because reducing stress is a significant benefit. But I'm not sure if it's the greatest effect compared to others.

I think I need to recall if there's any specific information about Baltes' study. I remember that some research suggests that flexitime can reduce stress and increase job satisfaction. However, in terms of the greatest effect, perhaps job satisfaction is the primary one because it's a more encompassing measure.

But wait, another thought: productivity is a key outcome that organizations care about. If flexitime leads to higher productivity without significant drawbacks, that could be the main reason companies implement it. So maybe the meta-analysis found that productivity (C) had the greatest beneficial effect.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is job satisfaction (D) because it's a more personal and positive outcome for employees.

Hmm, I'm a bit torn between C and D. But I think in most cases, job satisfaction is the primary outcome linked with increased flexibility. So I'm going to go with D: overall job satisfaction.

The meta-analysis by Baltes and colleagues (1999) likely found that instituting flexitime has the greatest beneficial effect on overall job satisfaction. Flexitime provides employees with more control over their work hours, which is a key factor in enhancing job satisfaction. While other outcomes like productivity, stress reduction, and absenteeism may improve, job satisfaction is a more comprehensive and frequently cited benefit in studies on work flexibility.
