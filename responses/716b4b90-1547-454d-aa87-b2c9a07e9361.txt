Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the question has two parts: (i) calculating the energy used by a heater and (ii) finding the line loss for a load at two different voltages. Let's start with part (i).

Part (i): How much energy is used by a 1,500-watt heater in 8 hours?

I remember that energy (in kilowatt-hours) is calculated by multiplying power (in watts) by time (in hours) and then converting watts to kilowatts. So, 1,500 watts is 1.5 kilowatts. Then, multiply that by 8 hours.

1.5 kW * 8 hours = 12 kWh. So the first part of the answer should be 12 kWh.

Now moving on to part (ii): A 12-kW load is supplied from a line with a resistance of 0.1 ohms in each conductor. We need to find the line loss when the load is supplied at (a) 120 volts and (b) 240 volts.

First, I think I need to find the current for each voltage. The load is 12 kW, which is 12,000 watts. Power (P) is V * I, so I can rearrange that to find current (I) as P/V.

But wait, I'm a bit confused here. Since the load is connected across both conductors, I think the voltage across the load is the supply voltage. So for each case, the load voltage is 120V and 240V respectively.

So for part (a) at 120V:

I_load = P / V = 12,000 W / 120 V = 100 A.

But wait, the line has a resistance in each conductor. So the total resistance for the circuit (from the load perspective) would be 0.1 ohms each way, so total R_line = 0.1 + 0.1 = 0.2 ohms.

Wait, no, that's correct because the current flows through both wires. So the line resistance is 0.1 ohms per conductor, so total resistance is 0.2 ohms.

Now, the current in the line is the same as the load current, which is 100 A. So the line loss (P_line) is I² * R_line.

So P_line = (100)^2 * 0.2 = 10,000 * 0.2 = 2,000 watts.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me make sure. Because when the supply voltage is applied across the load, the total voltage drop across the lines would be I*(R_line). But for the load voltage, perhaps we're assuming that the entire supply voltage is across the load, so the line losses are separate. Hmm, maybe I should approach it differently.

Alternatively, perhaps the line loss is calculated based on the current through each conductor. Since each conductor has 0.1 ohms, and the current is 100 A, each conductor has a voltage drop of I * R. So for each conductor, it's 100 * 0.1 = 10 V drop. So total voltage drop across both conductors is 20 V. But the supply voltage is 120 V, so the load voltage would be 120 - 20 = 100 V, but wait, that would affect the load's actual voltage. But the problem states that the load is supplied at 120 V, so maybe the line losses are considered elsewhere, and the load voltage is maintained at 120 V. So perhaps the line loss is calculated based on the current through the line resistors.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the total current and the line resistance. The load current is I = P_load / V. So for 120 V, I = 12,000 / 120 = 100 A. The line has two conductors each with 0.1 ohms, so total line resistance is 0.2 ohms. Then the line loss is I² * R_line = (100)^2 * 0.2 = 2000 W. So for part (a), the line loss is 2000 W.

Wait, but let me check again. Alternatively, the line loss per conductor is I^2 * R. Each conductor has 0.1 ohms, so each would have 100^2 * 0.1 = 1000 W. Since there are two conductors, 1000 * 2 = 2000 W. That matches the previous calculation.

Now for part (b) at 240 V:

I_load = 12,000 W / 240 V = 50 A.

Then the line loss would be I² * R_line. I is 50 A, R_line is 0.2 ohms.

So P_line = (50)^2 * 0.2 = 2500 * 0.2 = 500 W.

Wait, but wait: Alternatively, each conductor has 0.1 ohms, so for 50 A, each conductor's loss is 50^2 * 0.1 = 2500 * 0.1 = 250 W. Two conductors would give 250 * 2 = 500 W. Same result.

So part (ii) (a) is 2000 W, (b) is 500 W.

Now, looking at the options:

Let me check each option for part (i) and (ii).

The options are:

Each option has three values. The first is part (i), the next two are (ii)(a) and (ii)(b).

Looking for part (i) to be 12 kWh.

Looking at the options:

Option E: 12 kWh, 2000 W, 500 W.

Yes, that matches.

Option E: 12kwhr, 2000 watts, 500 watts.

So the answer should be E.

The first part of the problem calculates the energy used by a 1,500-watt heater over 8 hours. Converting watts to kilowatts and multiplying by time gives 12 kWh. For the second part, the line loss is determined for two voltages. At 120 volts, the current is 100 A, leading to a line loss of 2000 W. At 240 volts, the current is 50 A, resulting in a line loss of 500 W. Comparing these values to the options, the correct choice is E.

Answer: E
