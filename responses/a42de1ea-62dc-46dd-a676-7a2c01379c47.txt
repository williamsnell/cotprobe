Answer:
    
<think>
Okay, so I have this genetics problem to solve, and I need to think it through step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The question is about Mr. and Mrs. Brown, who both suffer from an autosomal recessive condition that causes anemia. So, autosomal means it's not on the sex chromosomes, so it's passed equally to sons and daughters from both parents. Recessive means they need two copies of the defective gene to show the disease.

Mr. Brown has an amino acid substitution in the beta-chain of his hemoglobin. I remember that hemoglobin has alpha and beta chains, and different mutations can cause different types of anemia. For example, sickle cell anemia affects the beta chain. Mrs. Brown's defect is in the alpha-chain, which might be something like alpha-thalassemia.

Their children, Betsy and Boopsy, aren't anemic. So, neither of them has the condition. The question is why that's the case.

Let me think about how autosomal recessive diseases are inherited. Both parents have the condition, so each must have two recessive alleles. Wait, no, wait. If the condition is recessive, each parent has one dominant and one recessive allele? No, wait, wait. No, wait, no—if both parents have the condition, that means they're homozygous recessive. Because you need two recessive alleles to show the disease when it's recessive.

Wait, but each parent has a different form of the condition. Mr. Brown's issue is with the beta chain, so his genotype would be something like bb where b is the recessive allele causing the beta-chain defect. Similarly, Mrs. Brown's issue is with the alpha chain—so her genotype would be AA for alpha, but wait, no. Wait, no, each parent has a different gene for alpha and beta chains. So, the beta chain is part of the HBB gene, and the alpha chain is part of the HBA gene. So, each parent has two recessive alleles for their respective gene.

Wait, but each parent has a different gene affected. So Mr. Brown has two recessive alleles for HBB, and Mrs. Brown has two recessive alleles for HBA. So when they have children, each child can inherit one allele from each parent, but since the genes are on different loci, the child would get one allele for HBA from Mrs. Brown and one from Mr. Brown, and similarly for HBB.

Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, each parent's condition is caused by a mutation in a different gene. So Mr. Brown's anemia is due to a beta-globin gene mutation (like HbS for sickle cell), and Mrs. Brown's is due to an alpha-globin gene mutation (like alpha-thalassemia). So each has their own recessive condition.

So each parent is homozygous for their respective mutation. Mr. Brown is homozygous recessive for the beta chain mutation, and Mrs. Brown is homozygous recessive for the alpha chain mutation.

When they have children, each child can inherit one allele from each parent. But because the mutations are in different genes, the children could potentially inherit one recessive allele for the beta gene and one for the alpha gene, but wait, no, each child would get one allele for each gene.

Wait, for each gene locus (HBA and HBB), each parent contributes one allele. So for HBA, Mrs. Brown can only give a recessive allele (since she's homozygous), and Mr. Brown's HBA alleles are normal because his mutation is in the HBB gene. Similarly, for HBB, Mr. Brown can only give the recessive allele, and Mrs. Brown's HBB alleles are normal because her mutation is in HBA.

Wait, no. Wait, each parent's genotype is for their own gene. So Mr. Brown's genotype for HBB is homozygous recessive (e.g., h homozygous), and his HBA is normal (Hh, assuming H is dominant). Mrs. Brown's HBA is homozygous recessive (e.g., h homozygous), and her HBB is normal (Hh).

So when they have children, each child gets one HBA allele from each parent and one HBB allele from each parent.

So for HBA:

- Mrs. Brown can give either h or h (since she's hh).
- Mr. Brown can give H or h (since he's Hh for HBA, assuming his HBA is normal because his mutation is in HBB).

Wait, but wait, wait. Wait, each parent has two alleles for each gene. So Mr. Brown has two alleles for HBA and two for HBB. His HBB is hh (since he has the condition), and his HBA is normal, so Hh. Mrs. Brown has HBB normal (Hh) and HBA hh.

So when they have children, each child will receive one HBA allele from each parent and one HBB allele from each parent.

Let's break it down:

For HBA (alpha chain gene):
- Mrs. Brown can only give h (since she's hh).
- Mr. Brown can give H or h (since he's Hh).

So the possible combinations for HBA in the child are:
- From Mrs. Brown: h
- From Mr. Brown: H or h

So the child's HBA genotype could be Hh (if they get H from Mr. Brown) or hh (if they get h from Mr. Brown). But wait, but Mrs. Brown is hh, so all her gametes carry h for HBA.

Similarly, for HBB (beta chain gene):
- Mr. Brown can only give h (since he's hh).
- Mrs. Brown can give H or h (since she's Hh).

So the child's HBB genotype could be Hh (if they get H from Mrs. Brown) or hh (if they get h from Mrs. Brown).

But the children are not anemic. So let's see what each child's genotype would look like.

Each child has:

HBA: h (from Mrs. Brown) and either H or h (from Mr. Brown).

HBB: h (from Mr. Brown) and either H or h (from Mrs. Brown).

So for HBA, if the child gets H from Mr. Brown, they have Hh (which is normal, since H is dominant). If they get h, they have hh, which would cause Mrs. Brown's type of anemia.

Similarly, for HBB, if the child gets H from Mrs. Brown, they have Hh (normal), and if they get h, they have hh (Mr. Brown's type of anemia).

But the children are not anemic. So let's see:

Each child must have at least one dominant allele for each gene to avoid the disease. Because the diseases are recessive.

So for HBA, the child must have at least one H (so Hh or HH) to not have Mrs. Brown's condition.

For HBB, the child must have at least one H (so Hh or HH) to not have Mr. Brown's condition.

So let's look at the possible combinations.

Each child has a 50% chance for each gene.

Wait, but since the genes are independent, the child's genotype for each gene is determined separately.

Wait, but each gene is on a different chromosome, so they assort independently.

So for HBA:

- 50% chance to get H from Mr. Brown, leading to Hh (no anemia).
- 50% chance to get h, leading to hh (Mrs. Brown's anemia).

Similarly, for HBB:

- 50% chance to get H from Mrs. Brown, leading to Hh (no anemia).
- 50% chance to get h, leading to hh (Mr. Brown's anemia).

But wait, the children are not anemic. So each child must have at least one dominant allele in both HBA and HBB.

Wait, but the children could have:

HBA: Hh (from Mr. Brown's H) and HBB: Hh (from Mrs. Brown's H).

Or any combination where they have H in either gene.

Wait, but each child's genotype would be:

HBA: h (from mom) + either H or h (from dad).

HBB: h (from dad) + either H or h (from mom).

So for each gene, there's a 50% chance of being Hh or hh.

But for the child to not be anemic, they need to have at least one H in each gene. So for HBA, they can't be hh, and for HBB, they can't be hh.

So the chance that a child is anemic would be if they have hh in HBA or hh in HBB. But wait, each condition is separate. Wait, but the parents have different conditions, so the children could potentially have both, but the question states that neither child is anemic, which suggests that in this case, both children are not affected.

Wait, but the options are about why the children aren't anemic.

Wait, but let's think about the possible genotypes.

Each child has:

HBA: h (from mom) and either H or h (from dad).

HBB: h (from dad) and either H or h (from mom).

So for each child, the possible combinations are:

HBA: Hh (50%) or hh (50%).

HBB: Hh (50%) or hh (50%).

But since the children are not anemic, that means neither HBA nor HBB is homozygous recessive.

So each child must have at least one H in HBA and at least one H in HBB.

So the only way this happens is if:

For HBA: they get H from dad (so Hh).

For HBB: they get H from mom (so Hh).

So the probability of each child being Hh for both HBA and HBB is 0.5 (for HBA) * 0.5 (for HBB) = 25%.

But that's the case where each child has Hh for both, meaning they're carriers but not affected.

Wait, but the question says neither child is anemic. So both children are either carriers or not affected. But the options don't directly address that.

Looking at the options:

Option E says the children cannot be carriers since they are not anemic. But that's not correct because being a carrier means you're heterozygous but not affected. So the children could be carriers but not anemic.

Option F says the children have a 50% chance of being carriers and a 25% chance of being affected. But that's not matching because each child's chance of being a carrier depends on each gene.

Wait, perhaps each child has a 50% chance of being a carrier for each parent's condition.

Wait, but the parents have different conditions—so each child could potentially carry one or both conditions.

Wait, but in this case, each child has a 50% chance of carrying the father's beta-chain mutation (if they get h from dad) and a 50% chance of carrying the mother's alpha-chain mutation (if they get h from mom).

So for each child:

- 50% chance to carry father's beta mutation (HBB hh? No, wait, the father is hh, so each child has 50% chance to get h from dad for HBB, making their HBB genotype Hh (if got H from mom) or hh (if got h from mom). Wait, no, the mom's HBB is Hh, so she can give H or h.

Wait, no, let me clarify:

Mr. Brown's HBB is hh (so he can only pass h).

Mrs. Brown's HBB is Hh (so she can pass H or h).

So for each child's HBB:

- 50% chance to get h from dad and H from mom → Hh (not affected).
- 50% chance to get h from dad and h from mom → hh (affected).

Similarly, for HBA:

Mrs. Brown's HBA is hh (so she can only pass h).

Mr. Brown's HBA is Hh (so he can pass H or h).

So for each child's HBA:

- 50% chance to get H from dad and h from mom → Hh (not affected).
- 50% chance to get h from dad and h from mom → hh (affected).

So each child has a 50% chance of being affected by Mrs. Brown's condition (alpha) and a 50% chance of being affected by Mr. Brown's condition (beta).

But the children are not anemic, so they must not have either condition. That would mean each child has at least one H in each gene.

Wait, but that would be a 25% chance (0.5 * 0.5) that each child is Hh for both genes. So each child has a 25% chance of being unaffected, meaning they're carriers for both.

Wait, but the question states that neither child is anemic. So all four possibilities (two children) must have been born without the conditions.

Wait, but this is a hypothetical scenario, not a probability question. The question is asking why the children aren't anemic.

So why aren't the children anemic? Because to have anemia, they'd need two recessive alleles for either the alpha or beta chain. But the parents each have recessive alleles for different genes. So each child can only get one recessive allele for each gene. Wait, no, because each child could potentially get two recessive alleles for one gene or the other, but not both.

Wait, no, each child could get a recessive allele for HBA or HBB, but not both unless they get both from each parent.

Wait, but since the parents' mutations are in different genes, the children can't get homozygous recessive for both genes unless they get h from both parents for each gene.

Wait, but each child can only get one allele per gene from each parent. So for HBA, the child gets h from mom and either H or h from dad. Similarly for HBB, the child gets h from dad and either H or h from mom.

So the child could have:

HBA: hh (from mom and dad) → affected by Mrs. Brown's anemia.

HBB: hh (from dad and mom) → affected by Mr. Brown's anemia.

But the children are not affected, so they must have at least one H in each gene.

So each child's genotype must be Hh for both HBA and HBB.

Wait, but that's only possible if they got H from one parent for each gene.

So the child's HBA is Hh (H from dad, h from mom) and HBB is Hh (H from mom, h from dad).

In this case, they are carriers for both conditions but not affected because they have one dominant allele for each gene.

So the children are not anemic because they have at least one dominant allele for each gene, making them carriers but not affected.

Looking back at the options, which one explains this.

Option E: The children cannot be carriers since they are not anemic.

No, that's incorrect because carriers are not affected but can pass the gene. So the children can be carriers.

Option F: The children have a 50% chance of being carriers and a 25% chance of being affected.

Hmm, but in reality, each child has a 50% chance of being a carrier for each gene. So for each gene, the child has a 50% chance of being a carrier (Hh) and 50% chance of being affected (hh).

But since the children are not anemic, it means they must be carriers for both, which is a 25% chance (0.5 * 0.5), but the question states that neither child is anemic, so perhaps in this case, both children happened to be carriers.

But the question is asking why the children aren't anemic, not about probabilities.

Looking for an option that says the children are carriers but not affected. But none of the options directly state that.

Wait, let me look at the options again.

Option E: The children cannot be carriers since they are not anemic. No, that's wrong because being a carrier doesn't make you anemic.

Option F: The children have a 50% chance of being carriers and a 25% chance of being affected. That's about probabilities, but the question states that neither child is anemic.

Wait, but the question is asking to explain why the children are not anemic, not about the probabilities, but the options don't have an option that directly states that the children are carriers and thus not anemic.

Wait, another option: Option E says the children cannot be carriers because they aren't anemic. But that's incorrect because being a carrier is possible without being anemic.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is Option E is incorrect, so maybe the correct reasoning is that each child can only inherit one recessive allele for each gene, making them carriers but not affected. So the children are carriers, not affected.

But the options don't have an option that directly says that. Let me look again.

Option E: The children cannot be carriers since they are not anemic. This is incorrect because carriers are not anemic.

Option F: The children have a 50% chance of being carriers and a 25% chance of being affected. This is about probabilities, but the question states that neither child is anemic, so perhaps the correct answer is F, but the question is about why the children aren't anemic, which would require them to have at least one dominant allele in each gene.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is that each child has a 50% chance for each gene, but the children in this case have inherited a dominant allele for both genes, making them not affected.

But the options don't directly address this.

Wait, looking at the options again:

Option E: The children cannot be carriers since they are not anemic.

No, because being a carrier doesn't make them anemic.

Option F: The children have a 50% chance of being carriers and a 25% chance of being affected.

This is a probability statement, but the question is about the children not being anemic, not the probabilities.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is E is incorrect, and the correct reasoning is that the children are carriers but not anemic, which is not directly stated in the options. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is that the parents each have a different recessive condition, so the children can't get both, but that's not the case because the children could get one or the other.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is that each child can only inherit one recessive allele for each gene, so they can't have both conditions, but that's not entirely accurate because they could have one condition if they get two recessive alleles for that gene.

Wait, but in this case, the children are not anemic, so they must have at least one dominant allele for each gene.

So the correct explanation is that each child has a 50% chance of being a carrier for each parent's condition, and a 25% chance of being affected by either condition. But since the children are not anemic, it means they must have at least one dominant allele for each gene.

Looking at the options, the only one that fits is Option F: The children have a 50% chance of being carriers and a 25% chance of being affected. But the question is about why the children aren't anemic, implying that in this case, they didn't inherit the conditions.

But perhaps the correct answer is Option E is incorrect, and the correct reasoning is that the children are carriers but not affected. However, the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is Option E is incorrect, and the correct answer is that the children are carriers but not anemic, which is not directly listed, but the closest is Option E, which is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is that the children are carriers but not anemic, which is not directly an option. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is that the parents each have a different gene mutation, so the children can't inherit both, but that's not entirely accurate because they could inherit one or the other.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is that each child can only inherit one recessive allele per gene, so they can't have both conditions, but that's not why the children aren't anemic. The children could have one condition if they inherit two recessive alleles for that gene.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to think differently.

The parents have different autosomal recessive conditions. So Mr. Brown has a beta-chain defect (homozygous recessive for HBB), and Mrs. Brown has an alpha-chain defect (homozygous recessive for HBA). When they have children, each child can inherit one allele from each parent for each gene.

So for each gene:

HBA: child gets h from mom (since she's hh) and either H or h from dad (dad is Hh for HBA).

HBB: child gets h from dad (since he's hh) and either H or h from mom (mom is Hh for HBB).

So for HBA, the child has a 50% chance of being Hh (not affected) and 50% of being hh (affected by Mrs. Brown's condition).

Similarly, for HBB, the child has a 50% chance of being Hh (not affected) and 50% of being hh (affected by Mr. Brown's condition).

But the children are not anemic, so they must not have either condition. That means for both genes, they must have at least one H allele.

So the only way is that the child got H from dad for HBA and H from mom for HBB. So the probability is 0.5 * 0.5 = 25% per child.

But the question states that neither child is anemic, which suggests that in this case, both children have inherited H from both parents, making them Hh for both genes. So they are carriers but not affected.

Looking at the options, none directly say that the children are carriers but not affected. Option E is incorrect because it says they can't be carriers, which is wrong. Option F talks about probabilities, but the question is about why they aren't anemic.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is that each child can only inherit one recessive allele from each parent, but that's not the case because they could inherit two.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is that the parents each have a different gene mutation, so the children can't get both, but that's not entirely accurate because they could get one.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is that the children are not affected because they have at least one dominant allele for each gene, making them carriers but not anemic. But the options don't have this.

Wait, looking at the options again, perhaps the correct answer is Option E is incorrect, and the correct reasoning is that the children are carriers but not anemic, but that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is that the children have a 50% chance of being carriers for each gene, but since the parents' mutations are in different genes, the children can't have both conditions unless they inherit two recessive alleles for each gene, which is 25% chance per child.

But the children aren't anemic, so they must have at least one dominant allele for each gene.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is that the children are carriers for both conditions but not affected, but the options don't have that.

Wait, looking back, the options:

Option E: The children cannot be carriers since they are not anemic. Incorrect.

Option F: The children have a 50% chance of being carriers and a 25% chance of being affected. This is about probabilities, but the question is why they aren't anemic.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is that each child cannot be affected because they can't inherit both recessive alleles for both genes. But that's not correct because they could inherit one gene's recessive alleles.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is that the parents' mutations are in different genes, so the children can't have both conditions, but that's not the case because they could have one.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to think of it another way.

Each parent has a different recessive condition. So Mr. Brown is homozygous recessive for HBB, and Mrs. Brown is homozygous recessive for HBA.

Each child will get one HBA allele from each parent and one HBB allele from each parent.

For HBA:

- From mom: h
- From dad: H or h

So child's HBA: Hh (if H from dad) or hh (if h from dad).

For HBB:

- From dad: h
- From mom: H or h

So child's HBB: Hh (if H from mom) or hh (if h from mom).

To not be anemic, the child must have at least one H in each gene.

So for HBA: Hh (not affected).

For HBB: Hh (not affected).

So the child must have H from dad for HBA and H from mom for HBB.

The probability of each child being Hh for both is 0.5 * 0.5 = 25%.

But the question says neither child is anemic, meaning in this case, both children must have inherited H from both parents for both genes. So they are carriers but not affected.

But the options don't have this scenario. The closest is Option F, which talks about probabilities, but the question is about the children not being anemic.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is that the children are carriers but not affected, which is not directly an option. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is that the children cannot be carriers because they're not anemic, which is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is that the children have a 50% chance for each gene, but the question states that neither is anemic, so perhaps the answer is that each child has a 50% chance of being a carrier, but the children in this case are both carriers, which is a 25% chance overall.

But the options don't directly state this.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is that each child can only inherit one recessive allele, making them carriers but not affected, which is not directly listed.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is Option E is incorrect, and the correct answer is that the children are carriers but not anemic, which is not an option.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the possible options again.

The question is why the children aren't anemic. The parents each have a different recessive condition. So the children can't get both conditions unless they inherit two recessive alleles for each gene, which is possible but not the case here.

But in this case, the children are not anemic, so they must have at least one dominant allele for each gene.

So the correct explanation is that the children are carriers for both conditions but not affected, meaning they have one dominant allele for each gene.

But looking at the options, the only one that somewhat fits is Option F, which talks about probabilities, but the question is about the specific case where the children aren't anemic.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is that each child can only inherit one recessive allele, so they can't have both conditions, but that's not entirely accurate.

Wait, I think I've spent enough time, and perhaps the correct answer is Option E is incorrect, and the correct answer is that the children are carriers but not affected, but since that's not an option, perhaps the correct answer is Option E is wrong, and the correct answer is that the children are carriers, which would make Option E incorrect.

Wait, but the options don't have that. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is that the children cannot be carriers because they are not anemic, which is Option E, but that's incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is that the children have a 50% chance of being carriers and a 25% chance of being affected. So Option F.

But the question states that neither child is anemic, which would mean that in this case, they didn't inherit the conditions, so perhaps the answer is Option F.

I think I'm getting stuck, but I'll go with Option E being incorrect, and the correct answer is that the children are carriers but not anemic, which is not directly listed, but perhaps the intended answer is Option E is incorrect, so the correct answer is that the children are carriers but not anemic, which would make Option E incorrect, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is that the children cannot be carriers because they are not anemic. But that's wrong because being a carrier doesn't make you anemic.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is that the parents each have a different gene mutation, so the children can't inherit both, but that's not entirely accurate because they could inherit one.

Wait, I think I'll settle on Option E being incorrect, and the correct answer is that the children are carriers but not anemic, which is not listed, but perhaps the intended answer is Option E is incorrect, so the correct answer is that the children are carriers, so Option E is wrong.

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is that the children have a 50% chance of being carriers for each gene, but the question is about why they're not anemic, so perhaps the answer is that they are carriers but not affected, which isn't an option, but the closest is Option F.

I think I'll go with Option E is incorrect, and the correct answer is that the children are carriers but not anemic, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is Option F.

The question involves Mr. and Mrs. Brown, who each suffer from an autosomal recessive condition causing anemia. Mr. Brown has a beta-chain hemoglobin mutation, while Mrs. Brown has an alpha-chain hemoglobin mutation. Their children, Betsy and Boopsy, are not anemic. The task is to determine why the children are not anemic.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Genetic Background of Parents**:
   - Mr. Brown is homozygous recessive for the beta-chain gene (HBB), meaning his genotype is **hh**.
   - Mrs. Brown is homozygous recessive for the alpha-chain gene (HBA), meaning her genotype is **hh**.

2. **Inheritance of Genes**:
   - For **HBA**:
     - Mrs. Brown can only pass **h** (since she is **hh**).
     - Mr. Brown can pass either **H** or **h** (since he is **Hh** for HBA).
     - Thus, each child has a 50% chance of inheriting **Hh** (not affected) and a 50% chance of inheriting **hh** (affected by Mrs. Brown's condition).
   - For **HBB**:
     - Mr. Brown can only pass **h** (since he is **hh**).
     - Mrs. Brown can pass either **H** or **h** (since she is **Hh** for HBB).
     - Thus, each child has a 50% chance of inheriting **Hh** (not affected) and a 50% chance of inheriting **hh** (affected by Mr. Brown's condition).

3. **Children's Genotypes**:
   - To avoid anemia, each child must inherit at least one dominant allele (**H**) for both **HBA** and **HBB**.
   - The probability of a child inheriting **Hh** for both genes (and thus being a carrier but not affected) is **25%** (0.5 * 0.5).

4. **Explanation of the Question**:
   - The children are not anemic because they have inherited at least one dominant allele for each gene, making them carriers but not affected by either condition.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A**: Incorrect. Both parents can pass the disorder, but the children have not inherited both recessive alleles.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. The children will not definitely pass the disorder because they are not affected.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. The children are not anemic because they have inherited dominant alleles, not due to an undetectable form of anemia.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. The parents are homozygous recessive, but this does not guarantee passing the disorder to their children.
- **Option E**: Incorrect. The children can be carriers but are not anemic because they have dominant alleles.
- **Option F**: Correct. The children have a 50% chance of being carriers for each gene and a 25% chance of being affected, aligning with the probabilities explained above.
- **Option G**: Incorrect. The disorder can be inherited from either parent, not just the mother.
- **Option H**: Incorrect. The parents can pass the disorder, but the children have not inherited both recessive alleles.
- **Option I**: Incorrect. The children are not anemic because they have dominant alleles, not due to a modifier gene.
- **Option J**: Incorrect. The children are not anemic and would not develop symptoms in adulthood.

### Conclusion:
The most accurate explanation is that the children have a 50% chance of being carriers for each gene and a 25% chance of being affected, as described in **Option F**.

**Answer: F**
