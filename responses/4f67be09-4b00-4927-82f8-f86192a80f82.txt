Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about the single-tax movement. The question is asking about the goal and economic rationale behind it, relating it to the Ricardian theory of land rents. Hmm, I remember that David Ricardo had some theories about land and economics, especially the concept of diminishing returns.

The single-tax movement... I think it was a late 19th-century idea. From what I recall, some economists and reformers wanted to simplify the tax system. Henry George, if I'm not mistaken, was a big proponent of this. His main idea was that the government should rely primarily on a single tax on land. Why land? I think Ricardo's theory suggested that land has a unique role in the economy because it's a natural resource and its value is tied to location and community infrastructure rather than individual effort.

So the Ricardian theory probably influenced the idea that land should be taxed because it's a source of unearned income. Unearned because it's not the result of labor or production but rather the location and society's development. Therefore, taxing land would capture this unearned wealth, which could then be used to fund government services without burdening other areas like labor or capital, which drive economic growth.

Looking at the options, option A says "To eliminate all taxes but a tax on land." That sounds right because Henry George's proposal was to have a single tax on land, replacing other taxes. Other options don't fit as well. Option B talks about taxing corporate profits, which is different. Option C is about wealth and capital gains, which isn't specific to land. Option D is about income, which George wasn't focused on. Option E is too broad, just eliminating all taxes, which isn't what George wantedâ€”he wanted to replace them with a land tax. Option F is about consumption, which is a different tax approach. Option G is a flat tax on income, which again, not land. Option H is about trade taxes, which doesn't relate. Option I is about reducing taxes on land, which is the opposite of what the movement aimed for. Option J is increasing all taxes, which doesn't make sense.

So putting it all together, the single-tax movement aimed to eliminate all other taxes and have just a tax on land. The rationale was that land's value is unearned and that this tax would be fair and efficient, promoting economic equality and reducing the incentive to speculate on land.

The single-tax movement, influenced by the Ricardian theory of land rents, sought to eliminate all other taxes and impose a single tax on land. This approach was based on the idea that land's value arises from its location and community development, making it a source of unearned income. Taxing land was seen as a fair and efficient way to fund government without burdening labor or capital.
