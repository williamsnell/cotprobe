Alright, I'm trying to figure out the answer to the question: "The first commercial radio station was located in what city?" The options are A through J, with cities including New York, Cleveland, Austin, and others.

I remember from history classes that the early days of radio were in the early 20th century. I think the first commercial radio station was in the United States, but I'm not exactly sure which city. I've heard of some cities being significant in media history, like New York and San Francisco, but maybe it's not one of the big ones.

Wait, I think it might be Cleveland. I recall something about a station in Cleveland being one of the first. Maybe it was around 1920 or so. Let me think, was it called something like WHK or something similar? I'm not entirely certain, but I think Cleveland is the right answer. I don't remember any of the other cities listed being the first for commercial radio. So, I'll go with option B: Cleveland.
