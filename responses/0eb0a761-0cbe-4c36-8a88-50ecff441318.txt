Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about predicting a child's adjustment after a divorce. I'm a bit rusty on my psychology, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is asking which factor is the best predictor of a child's post-divorce adjustment in the two years following the divorce. The options are A through J, each representing different factors.

First, I'll try to recall what I know about child adjustment after divorce. From what I remember, the quality of the relationship between the child and each parent, as well as the level of conflict between the parents, can have significant effects. Also, the way the divorce is handled—like whether there's a lot of hostility or if the parents can cooperate—might play a role.

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: Level of involvement of the non-custodial parent. I think that having an involved non-custodial parent (like a dad if mom has custody) is important because it gives the child a sense of stability and ongoing support. If the non-custodial parent is absent or uninvolved, the child might feel more abandoned, which could affect their adjustment.

Option B: Age of the child at the time of the divorce. I'm not sure. I know that younger children might have different reactions than older ones. For example, younger kids might not understand what's happening and could feel more confused, while teens might have different coping mechanisms. But I'm not certain if age itself is the best predictor, or if it's more about other factors like conflict between parents.

Option C: Degree of continued conflict between the parents after the divorce. This seems really important. If the parents are still fighting, arguing, or not getting along after the divorce, that could create a stressful environment for the child. The child might feel caught in the middle, leading to anxiety, behavioral issues, or other adjustment problems. I remember reading that ongoing conflict is a major factor in how well children adjust.

Option D: Degree of hostility during the divorce process. The divorce process itself being hostile could affect the child. If the parents are fighting a lot during the divorce, the child might witness a lot of negativity, which could be traumatic. But I'm not sure if this is more about the process itself or the ongoing conflict after the divorce, which is option C. Maybe the hostility during the process could predict future conflict, but I'm not sure if it's the best predictor.

Option E: Residence of the child with the preferred parent. I'm a bit confused about this. "Preferred parent" might mean the parent the child was closer to, but I'm not sure how this directly affects adjustment. If the child stays with the parent they're more comfortable with, maybe that's better, but I'm not sure if this is the main factor.

Option F: Child's academic performance before the divorce. I don't think this is directly related. Academic performance could be affected by the divorce, but it's more about how the child was doing before. Unless poor performance is a sign of underlying issues, but I don't think this is the best predictor.

Option G: Financial status of the parents after the divorce. Financial stability can affect the child's well-being, like their living conditions, access to resources, etc. But I'm not sure if it's the best predictor compared to other factors like parental conflict.

Option H: Withdrawal of the more disturbed parent. If one parent is withdrawing, maybe due to their own issues, that could leave the child without support. But this seems like a specific situation rather than a general predictor.

Option I: Level of support from extended family. Extended family support can help, but I'm not sure if it's the primary factor. The immediate parents' relationship and involvement might have a bigger impact.

Option J: Frequency of the child's contact with friends after the divorce. Social support from friends is important, but again, I'm not sure if this is the main predictor compared to family dynamics.

Now, thinking about what I know from studies on divorce and child adjustment. I recall that the most consistent predictor is the level of conflict between the parents after the divorce. High levels of conflict, whether it's arguments, disputes over custody, or ongoing issues, create an unstable and stressful environment for the child. This can lead to emotional and behavioral problems. So, option C seems to be the best answer.

I also thought about option A, the non-custodial parent's involvement, which is important, but I think the ongoing conflict between both parents is a more critical factor. Even if one parent is involved, if the other is not and there's conflict, it might be worse for the child.

So, putting it all together, I think the best answer is C.

The best predictor of a child’s post-divorce adjustment is the degree of continued conflict between the parents after the divorce, as ongoing conflict creates a stressful environment that negatively impacts the child's adjustment.
