Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the parameters of the T-equivalent circuit for this transformer when referred to the low voltage winding. Hmm, let me start by recalling what I know about transformers and equivalent circuits.

The transformer is 200 kVA, 13,200/2,200 volts, 60 Hz, single-phase. The test data includes open-circuit and short-circuit tests. The question is asking for the parameters when referred to the low voltage side, which is 2,200 volts.

First, I think I need to determine the turns ratio (a). The turns ratio is the primary voltage divided by the secondary voltage. Here, primary is 13,200 V and secondary is 2,200 V. So a = 13,200 / 2,200. Let me calculate that: 13,200 ÷ 2,200 = 6. So the turns ratio is 6. Looking at the options, options A, D, G, I have a turns ratio of 6. Options B is 5.7, C is 5.82, H is 5.82, etc. Wait, no, G is 5.82? Let me check. Oh, no, option G says turns ratio =5.82. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake. Wait, 13,200 divided by 2,200 is exactly 6, so that's straightforward. So options A, D, I have a=6. Let me check the options again.

Looking back, option A: a=6. So that's correct. But maybe I should double-check because sometimes the turns ratio might be calculated based on the actual test data. Wait, no, the turns ratio is given by the voltage ratio. So a=13,200/2,200=6. So the correct a is 6. So that narrows down to options A, D, I. Wait, I is 6, but the other options like D is 5.90, which is close but not exactly 6. So perhaps the options are using some approximation. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to calculate it from the test data instead of using the given ratio.

Wait, the test data: when the transformer is open-circuited, the primary is at 13,200 V, and the secondary is open, so the voltage is 12,800 V. Wait, that seems off. Wait, the open circuit test is usually done on the primary side, so the secondary is open. Wait, no, in the open circuit test, the primary is connected to the supply, and the secondary is open. So the open circuit test data would be on the primary side. Wait, but in the question, the open circuit test is given as 2,200 volts, 3.1 amps, 1550 watts, 60 Hz. Wait, that doesn't add up because 2,200 V is the secondary voltage, right? So maybe the open circuit test is done on the secondary side, which is why the voltage is 2,200 V.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. In open circuit tests, you apply voltage to one side and leave the other open. The open circuit test data is usually taken when the primary is connected to the supply, and the secondary is open. So the voltage would be the primary voltage, which is 13,200 V. But in the data given, the open circuit test has 2,200 V, 3.1 A, 1550 W, 60 Hz. That suggests that the test was done on the secondary side. Because 2,200 V is the secondary's rated voltage. So perhaps the open circuit test was conducted on the secondary side, which is why the voltage is 2,200 V.

Wait, but that's not typical. Usually, the open circuit test is done on the primary side. But the data here seems to indicate otherwise. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the test was done by applying to the secondary and measuring the primary. No, that's more like a short circuit test. Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me approach this step by step.

First, calculate the turns ratio using the given voltage ratio. The transformer is 13,200 V / 2,200 V. So a = 13,200 / 2,200 = 6. So that's straightforward.

Next, for the equivalent circuit, we need to find R, Y_oc (open circuit admittance), X_mag (magnetizing reactance), and others. Let's start with the open circuit test data.

The open circuit test data is given as 2,200 V, 3.1 A, 1550 W. Since this is the open circuit test, the current is the magnetizing current, and the power is the core loss (P_fe). So the core loss is 1550 W.

The magnetizing current I0 is 3.1 A on the secondary side (since the test is on the secondary side). Wait, no, because the open circuit test is usually done on the primary, but the data here seems to be on the secondary. Alternatively, perhaps the test was done with the primary open? Or maybe I'm misunderstanding the setup.

Wait, perhaps the open circuit test data is given for the secondary side. So when the secondary is open, the primary is connected to the supply. So the voltage applied would be the primary voltage, but the current would be the magnetizing current on the primary side. But in the data, the voltage is 2,200 V, which is the secondary voltage. Hmm, I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the test data is given as follows: when the secondary is open, the primary is connected to a voltage, and the current is measured. But the data here shows 2,200 V, which is the secondary's rated voltage, so perhaps it's being applied to the secondary. Wait, that can't be right because the secondary is open, so the primary would have a certain voltage. Maybe I should think differently.

Wait, perhaps the open circuit test is done on the primary side, but the voltage is given as 2,200 V. That doesn't make sense because the primary is 13,200 V. Alternatively, perhaps the test was done on the secondary side, applying a voltage to the secondary and measuring the current. But in that case, the voltage would be higher if the primary is open.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me proceed with the data as given. The open circuit test has a voltage of 2,200 V, current 3.1 A, power 1550 W. So the power is V * I, so 2,200 * 3.1 ≈ 6,820 W, but the data says 1550 W. That doesn't match. So perhaps there's a mistake in the data, or I'm misunderstanding it.

Wait, perhaps the data is given in a different way. Let me check: Open circuit test: 2,200 V, 3.1 A, 1550 W. So V=2,200 V, I=3.1 A, P=1550 W. Let me compute: 2200 * 3.1 = 6820 W, but the power is given as 1550 W. That doesn't add up. So perhaps the data is incorrect, or perhaps I'm misinterpreting it. Alternatively, maybe it's the power factor that's involved. Wait, but in open circuit tests, the power factor is almost unity because the magnetizing current is inductive but the losses are resistive. But that's not the case here because the power is less than V*I. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the open circuit test data is given as:

Volts: 2,200 V (which would be the primary voltage if the test is on the primary side)

Amps: 3.1 A (primary current)

Watts: 1550 W (core loss).

But then, the primary voltage is 13,200 V, so how come the open circuit test is 2,200 V? That doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the test was done on the secondary side, applying 2,200 V to the secondary, which would cause the primary to have a certain voltage due to inductive reactance, but that's more complicated.

Alternatively, maybe the data is swapped. Wait, perhaps the open circuit test is on the primary side, so the voltage is 13,200 V, current is 3.1 A, and power is 1550 W. That would make more sense because 13,200 * 3.1 ≈ 40,920 W, which is way higher than 1550 W. So that can't be.

Wait, perhaps the data is for the secondary side. So when the secondary is open, the primary is connected to the supply, but the voltage on the primary is 13,200 V, and the current is 3.1 A, power 1550 W. Then, when referred to the secondary, the current would be I0 * a, because the current on the primary is I0, and on the secondary, it's I0 * a, since the current ratio is a. Wait, no, the current ratio is inverse of the turns ratio. So if a = 6, then I_primary = I_secondary / a.

Wait, but I'm getting more confused. Maybe I should proceed with the short circuit test data first.

The short circuit test data is given as 210 V, 90.9 A, 2500 W, 60 Hz. Assuming this is on the primary side, because short circuit tests are usually done on the primary. So when the primary is shorted, the secondary is shorted, and the primary is connected to a reduced voltage.

Wait, but the voltage here is 210 V on the primary side. So the short circuit current on the primary is 90.9 A, and the power is 2500 W. So the power is V * I * cos(theta), where theta is the power factor. Since it's a short circuit, the power factor is almost unity because the current is mostly due to the armature reactance. So cos(theta) ≈ 1. So P = 210 * 90.9 ≈ 19,089 W, but the given power is 2500 W. That's way lower. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the test setup.

Wait, perhaps the short circuit test is done on the secondary side. So the secondary is shorted, and the primary is connected to a reduced voltage. The voltage on the primary would then be (V_primary) = (V_secondary_short) * a. Wait, but the data says 210 V on the primary, 90.9 A on the primary, and power 2500 W.

Wait, maybe the current is on the secondary side. Let me think: when the secondary is shorted, the current on the secondary is I_s = I_sc (short circuit current on secondary). The primary current I_p would be I_s / a. So if the short circuit current on the secondary is 90.9 A, then I_p = 90.9 /6 ≈ 15.15 A. But the data says I_p is 90.9 A, which would imply that the short circuit current on the secondary is much higher, which doesn't make sense because the primary current would be lower.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to approach this methodically.

First, calculate the turns ratio a = V1 / V2 = 13,200 / 2,200 = 6. So a=6.

Next, for the open circuit test, which is usually on the primary. The open circuit test on the primary would involve applying the primary voltage (13,200 V) and measuring the current (I0) and core loss (P_fe). But in the data, the open circuit test is given as 2,200 V, 3.1 A, 1550 W. That suggests that the test was done on the secondary side, with 2,200 V applied to the secondary, and the current is the magnetizing current on the secondary side.

Wait, but the secondary is open, so the magnetizing current would be I0_secondary = I0. When the secondary is open, the primary would have a certain current, but the voltage applied would be the primary voltage. So perhaps the data is given for the secondary side, but it's unclear. Alternatively, perhaps the data is swapped, and the open circuit test is on the primary, but the data is given as 2,200 V, which is the secondary voltage. That doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the open circuit test is done on the secondary, so the voltage applied is 2,200 V (the secondary's rated voltage), and the current is the magnetizing current on the secondary. Then, the core loss would be the power, which is 1550 W. So the magnetizing current I0_secondary is 3.1 A. Since the turns ratio is 6, the magnetizing current on the primary side would be I0_primary = I0_secondary * a = 3.1 * 6 = 18.6 A. But that would mean that when the secondary is open, the primary current is 18.6 A when 2,200 V is applied to the secondary. But I'm not sure if that's the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the open circuit test is done on the primary, and the data given is for the primary. But then the voltage would be 13,200 V, not 2,200 V. So I'm confused about this part.

Let me try to proceed with the short circuit test data. The short circuit test is done on the primary, so the primary is connected to a reduced voltage, and the secondary is shorted. The voltage is 210 V on the primary, current 90.9 A, power 2500 W.

The power in the short circuit test is the copper loss, which is I^2 R, but it's usually measured as V * I * cos(theta). Since it's a short circuit, the power factor is close to 1, so P ≈ V * I.

So P = 210 * 90.9 ≈ 19,089 W, but the data says 2500 W. That's a discrepancy. So perhaps the data is given for the secondary side short circuit test.

Wait, if the short circuit test is done on the secondary, then the voltage applied is V2_sc = 210 V on the secondary, and the current is I2_sc = 90.9 A on the secondary. Then, the copper loss on the secondary would be I2^2 * R2. But we need to find R, the total resistance, which is R1 + R2, but when referred to the low voltage side, perhaps we need to calculate R2 and then refer it to the primary.

Wait, the transformer's resistance on the primary is R1 = (V1^2) / (Pc), where Pc is the copper loss. Similarly, on the secondary, R2 = (V2^2) / (Pc). But when referred to the low voltage side, R_total would be R2 + (R1 / a^2), because when referring to the secondary side, the primary resistances are scaled down by a^2.

Wait, no, when referring to the low voltage side, the equivalent resistance R' is R2 + (R1 / a^2). So first, let's calculate R1 and R2 from the short circuit test.

From the short circuit test on the primary: V1_sc = 210 V, I1_sc = 90.9 A, P_fe + Pc = 2500 W. Wait, but short circuit test power is the copper loss only, because the core is not excited (since it's a short circuit). So the power should be V * I * cos(theta). Assuming cos(theta) ≈ 1, P ≈ 210 * 90.9 ≈ 19,089 W, but the data says 2500 W. That's way off. So perhaps the short circuit test is done on the secondary side.

If the short circuit test is on the secondary, then the voltage applied to the secondary is V2_sc = 210 V, current I2_sc = 90.9 A, power P = 2500 W. So the copper loss is I2^2 * R2 = 2500 W. So R2 = 2500 / (90.9)^2 ≈ 2500 / 8,262 ≈ 0.3025 ohms.

Wait, that seems very low. Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate R2 as V2_sc^2 / (Pc). So R2 = (210)^2 / 2500 ≈ 44,100 / 2500 ≈ 17.64 ohms.

Wait, that makes more sense. Because R2 = V2^2 / Pc = 210^2 / 2500 = 44,100 / 2500 ≈ 17.64 ohms.

Then, R1 is the primary resistance, which can be found using the turns ratio. Since R1 = (a^2) * R2. So R1 = 6^2 * 17.64 = 36 *17.64 ≈ 635 ohms.

Wait, but that seems high. Alternatively, perhaps R1 is calculated from the short circuit test on the primary. Let me think again.

If the short circuit test is done on the primary, then V1_sc = 210 V, I1_sc = 90.9 A, P = 2500 W. So R1 = V1_sc^2 / (Pc) = 210^2 / 2500 ≈ 17.64 ohms. Then, R2 = R1 / a^2 = 17.64 /36 ≈ 0.49 ohms.

But then, when referred to the low voltage side, the equivalent resistance R' would be R2 + R1 / a^2. But if R1 is 17.64, then R1 / a^2 = 17.64 /36 ≈ 0.49 ohms. So R' = R2 + R1/a^2 = 0.49 + 0.49 ≈ 0.98 ohms. That's not matching any of the options. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate R_total as R1 + R2, but when referring to the low voltage side, it's R_total' = R2 + (R1 / a^2). So if R1 is 17.64 and R2 is 0.49, then R_total' = 0.49 + (17.64 /36) = 0.49 + 0.49 ≈ 0.98 ohms. Again, not matching.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating R2. Let me try using the short circuit data correctly.

The short circuit test is done on the primary, so V1_sc = 210 V, I1_sc = 90.9 A. The power is 2500 W, which is the copper loss (Pc). So Pc = V1_sc * I1_sc * cos(theta). Assuming cos(theta) ≈ 1, Pc ≈ 210 *90.9 ≈ 19,089 W. But the data says 2500 W, which is way less. So that can't be right. Therefore, perhaps the data is given for the secondary side.

So if the short circuit test is on the secondary, then V2_sc = 210 V, I2_sc = 90.9 A. Then, Pc = V2_sc * I2_sc * cos(theta) ≈ 210 *90.9 ≈ 19,089 W, but data says 2500 W. So that's not matching either.

Wait, perhaps the short circuit test data has a power of 2500 W, which is the copper loss. So if it's on the primary, then R1 = V1_sc^2 / Pc = 210^2 /2500 ≈ 17.64 ohms. Then, R2 = R1 / a^2 = 17.64 /36 ≈ 0.49 ohms.

Then, when referred to the low voltage side, the equivalent resistance R' = R2 + (R1 / a^2) = 0.49 + 0.49 ≈ 0.98 ohms. But looking at the options, the r_1' + r_2 values are around 0.29 to 0.35 ohms. So 0.98 is way higher than any option. So I must have made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps the short circuit test data is given on the primary, but the power is 2500 W, which is the copper loss. So R1 = (210)^2 /2500 ≈ 17.64 ohms. Then, R2 = R1 / a^2 = 17.64 /36 ≈ 0.49 ohms. So when referred to the low voltage side (secondary), the equivalent resistance is R' = R2 + R1 / a^2 = 0.49 + 0.49 ≈ 0.98 ohms. But none of the options have this value. The closest is option B: 0.295, option D: 0.305, option G:0.303, etc.

Hmm, perhaps I'm miscalculating the equivalent resistance. Let me think again. When you refer the primary resistances to the secondary side, R1 becomes R1 / a^2, and then you add R2. So R_total' = R1' + R2 = (R1 / a^2) + R2.

Wait, but R1 is the primary resistance, which is already calculated as 17.64 ohms. So R1' = 17.64 / (6^2) = 17.64 /36 ≈ 0.49 ohms. Then, R_total' = 0.49 + R2. But R2 is the secondary resistance, which is R2 = (V2^2) / Pc_secondary. Wait, but I'm getting confused again.

Alternatively, perhaps the short circuit test data is given on the primary, and the power is 2500 W, which is the copper loss. So R1 = (210)^2 /2500 ≈ 17.64 ohms. Then, R2 = R1 / a^2 = 17.64 /36 ≈ 0.49 ohms. So the total resistance on the secondary side is R_total' = R2 + R1 /a^2 = 0.49 + 0.49 ≈ 0.98 ohms. But the options don't have this. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the test setup.

Wait, maybe the short circuit test data is given on the secondary side, so V2_sc = 210 V, I2_sc = 90.9 A, Pc = 2500 W. So R2 = (210)^2 /2500 ≈ 17.64 ohms. Then, R1 = a^2 * R2 = 36 *17.64 ≈ 635 ohms. So when referred to the secondary side, the equivalent resistance is R_total' = R2 + R1 / a^2 = 17.64 + (635 /36) ≈ 17.64 +17.64 ≈35.28 ohms. That's not matching either.

I'm clearly making a mistake here. Let me try a different approach. Let me look for the magnetizing reactance and the core losses.

From the open circuit test, the voltage is 2,200 V, current is 3.1 A, power is 1550 W. So the magnetizing current is 3.1 A on the secondary side. The magnetizing inductance L is such that V = I0 * X_mag. So X_mag = V / I0. But wait, the open circuit voltage is the voltage applied, which is 2,200 V on the secondary side, and the current is 3.1 A. So X_mag_secondary = V_oc / I0_secondary = 2200 /3.1 ≈709.68 ohms. Then, X_mag_primary = a^2 * X_mag_secondary = 36 *709.68 ≈25,552 ohms. But that seems very high.

Wait, but in the options, the X_mag values are around 700-730 ohms. Hmm, perhaps I should consider that the open circuit test is on the primary side, so the voltage is 13,200 V, current I0_primary = I0_secondary / a =3.1 /6 ≈0.5167 A. Then, X_mag_primary = 13,200 /0.5167 ≈25,552 ohms, which matches the previous calculation. But that's way higher than the options given. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the test setup.

Alternatively, perhaps the open circuit test is on the primary, but the data is given as 2,200 V, which is the secondary voltage. That doesn't make sense because the primary voltage is 13,200 V.

I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to look for another approach. Maybe I should calculate the magnetizing current from the open circuit test. The open circuit test gives the core losses and the magnetizing current. The magnetizing current on the secondary side is 3.1 A, so on the primary side, it's 3.1 /6 ≈0.5167 A.

The magnetizing reactance X_mag is V_oc / I0. If the open circuit test is on the primary, then X_mag_primary = 13,200 /0.5167 ≈25,552 ohms. But in the options, X_mag is around 700-730 ohms, which is much lower. So perhaps the open circuit test was done on the secondary, and X_mag_secondary =2200 /3.1 ≈709.68 ohms, which matches the options' X_mag around 700-710 ohms. Then, X_mag_primary =a^2 * X_mag_secondary =36 *709.68 ≈25,552 ohms, but again, that's not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps the magnetizing reactance is given as X_mag_secondary, which is 709.68 ohms, so the option with X_mag ≈710 ohms would be correct. Looking at the options, option A has X_mag=710 ohms, option G has 727, option D has 720, etc. So that could be a clue.

Now, the equivalent circuit when referred to the low voltage side would have R_total' = R1' + R2, where R1' is R1 /a^2. So R1 = (V1^2) / Pc_primary. Wait, but I'm not sure about the copper loss on the primary. Alternatively, from the short circuit test, R1 is calculated as V1_sc^2 / Pc_sc. But earlier, I was confused about whether the test was on the primary or secondary.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the short circuit test data on the primary to find R1. The short circuit test on the primary gives V1_sc =210 V, I1_sc=90.9 A, P=2500 W. So R1 = V1_sc^2 /Pc = (210)^2 /2500 ≈17.64 ohms. Then, R2 = R1 /a^2 =17.64 /36 ≈0.49 ohms. So when referred to the low voltage side, R_total' = R2 + R1' =0.49 + (17.64 /36) ≈0.49 +0.49=0.98 ohms. But none of the options have this. So perhaps I'm doing something wrong.

Wait, perhaps the short circuit test was done on the secondary, so the voltage is 210 V on the secondary, current 90.9 A, power 2500 W. Then, R2 = (210)^2 /2500 ≈17.64 ohms. R1 = a^2 * R2 =36 *17.64 ≈635 ohms. So when referred to the low voltage side, R_total' = R2 + (R1 /a^2) =17.64 + (635 /36)≈17.64 +17.64≈35.28 ohms. Still not matching the options.

I'm clearly missing something here. Let me try to look at the options and see which one fits the calculated X_mag around 710 ohms. Options A, D, G, J have X_mag around 710-750. Now, let's look at the R values. If the correct R_total' is around 0.3 ohms, then options B (0.295), D (0.305), G (0.303), etc., are close.

Wait, earlier I calculated R_total' as 0.98 ohms, but that's not matching. Perhaps I should re-express R_total' correctly. Let me think again.

The equivalent circuit when referred to the low voltage side has R_total' = R2 + (R1 /a^2). R1 is the primary resistance, which is (V1^2) / (Pc_primary). But wait, Pc_primary is the copper loss on the primary, which from the short circuit test is V1_sc * I1_sc * cos(theta). If the short circuit test is on the primary, then V1_sc=210 V, I1_sc=90.9 A, so Pc_primary=210*90.9≈19,089 W. But data says 2500 W, which is way less. So that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps the short circuit test is done on the secondary, so V2_sc=210 V, I2_sc=90.9 A, so Pc_secondary=210*90.9≈19,089 W. But data says 2500 W, which is a problem.

I'm stuck. Let me try to think differently. The options give R values around 3000-4000 ohms. So perhaps the R is the magnetizing resistance, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps R is the total resistance of the transformer when referred to the low voltage side. So R_total' = R1' + R2 = (R1 /a^2) + R2.

From the short circuit test on the primary: V1_sc=210 V, I1_sc=90.9 A, so R1=210^2 / (2500) ≈17.64 ohms. Then R1' =17.64 /36≈0.49 ohms. R2 is found from the short circuit test on the secondary: V2_sc=210 V, I2_sc=90.9 A, so R2=210^2 /2500≈17.64 ohms. Wait, but that can't be because R2 would be much smaller. Alternatively, perhaps R2 is (V2_sc^2)/(Pc_secondary), but if Pc_secondary is 2500 W, then R2=210^2/2500≈17.64 ohms. But that would make R_total' =0.49 +17.64≈18.13 ohms, which doesn't match.

I'm clearly not getting this right. Maybe I should look for another approach. Let me consider the magnetizing reactance and the core losses.

From the open circuit test on the secondary: V=2,200 V, I=3.1 A, P=1550 W. So the magnetizing current is 3.1 A on the secondary. The magnetizing reactance X_mag_secondary = V_oc / I0_secondary =2200 /3.1≈709.68 ohms. Then, X_mag_primary =a^2 * X_mag_secondary=36 *709.68≈25,552 ohms. But in the options, X_mag is around 700-730 ohms, which suggests that X_mag is given on the secondary side, so X_mag=709.68≈710 ohms, which matches option A's X_mag=710 ohms.

Now, the equivalent circuit when referred to the low voltage side would have the magnetizing reactance as X_mag_secondary=710 ohms. So that points towards option A, which has X_mag=710 ohms.

Next, the resistance R in the options is the total resistance when referred to the low voltage side. So R_total' = R1' + R2. R1 is the primary resistance, which from the short circuit test on the primary is R1= (V1_sc)^2 / Pc_primary. But I'm not sure about Pc_primary. Alternatively, if the short circuit test is on the primary, then Pc_primary=210 *90.9≈19,089 W, which is much higher than the given 2500 W. So perhaps the short circuit test is on the secondary.

If the short circuit test is on the secondary, V2_sc=210 V, I2_sc=90.9 A, Pc_secondary=210 *90.9≈19,089 W, but the data says 2500 W. So that's conflicting. Alternatively, perhaps the power is given as 2500 W, so R2=210^2 /2500≈17.64 ohms. Then, R1= a^2 * R2=36 *17.64≈635 ohms. So R_total' = R1' + R2=635/36 +17.64≈17.64 +17.64≈35.28 ohms, which is not matching any option.

Alternatively, perhaps the short circuit test is on the primary, and the power is given as 2500 W, which would imply R1=210^2 /2500≈17.64 ohms. Then, R2=17.64 /36≈0.49 ohms. So R_total' =0.49 +0.49≈0.98 ohms, which is higher than any option.

I'm stuck again. Let me think about the turns ratio. Earlier, I thought a=6, but options A, D, and I have a=6. Option G has a=5.82, which is close to 6 but not exactly. Given that the voltage ratio is exactly 6, I think a=6 is correct.

Looking at option A: a=6, R=2900 ohms, Y_oc=1.55e-3 mho, |b_mag|=1.40e-3, |X_mag|=710 ohms, r1' + r2=0.32 ohm, |X_sc|=2.1 ohm.

Wait, R in the options is probably the total resistance when referred to the low voltage side. So R_total' = R1' + R2. Let me calculate R1 and R2.

From the short circuit test on the primary: V1_sc=210 V, I1_sc=90.9 A, P=2500 W. So R1=210^2 /2500=17.64 ohms. Then, R2= R1 /a^2=17.64 /36≈0.49 ohms. So R_total'=0.49 +0.49=0.98 ohms, but option A says 0.32 ohm. That's not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps R in the options is the magnetizing resistance, but that's not likely.

Wait, perhaps R is the core loss resistance, but I'm not sure.

Another approach: The open circuit test gives the core losses (P_fe=1550 W). The magnetizing current is I0_secondary=3.1 A, so the magnetizing reactance X_mag_secondary=2200/3.1≈709.68 ohms, which matches option A's X_mag=710 ohms.

The equivalent circuit when referred to the low voltage side has the magnetizing branch with X_mag_secondary=710 ohms, and the resistance R_total' which is the sum of R1' and R2.

So R_total'= R1' + R2. R1' is R1 /a^2. R1 is the primary resistance from the short circuit test.

If the short circuit test is on the primary, then R1= (210)^2 /2500=17.64 ohms. R1'=17.64 /36≈0.49 ohms. R2= (2,200)^2 / (Pc_secondary). Wait, but I don't have Pc_secondary. Alternatively, from the short circuit test on the secondary, V2_sc=210 V, I2_sc=90.9 A, so Pc_secondary=210*90.9≈19,089 W, which is way higher than the given 2500 W. So that can't be.

I'm clearly missing something here. Let me try to look for another angle. The options give Y_oc as 1.55e-3 mho for option A. Y_oc is the open circuit admittance, which is 1/(X_mag). So if X_mag=710 ohms, then Y_oc=1/710≈1.408e-3 mho. But option A says Y_oc=1.55e-3 mho, which is a bit higher. That suggests that X_mag is slightly lower.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate Y_oc from the open circuit test. Y_oc = I0 / V_oc. I0=3.1 A on the secondary, V_oc=2,200 V. So Y_oc=3.1 /2200≈0.001409 mho=1.409e-3 mho. So option A has Y_oc=1.55e-3, which is higher. Option G has Y_oc=1.41e-3, which is closer.

Hmm, so if Y_oc is 1.409e-3, then option G's Y_oc=1.41e-3 is a match. So option G has Y_oc=1.41e-3, X_mag=727 ohms, which would correspond to Y_oc=1/727≈1.376e-3 mho, which is close to option G's Y_oc.

Wait, but my calculation from the open circuit test gives Y_oc=1.409e-3, which matches option A's Y_oc=1.55e-3? No, option A's Y_oc is higher. So perhaps the correct Y_oc is around 1.409e-3, which matches option G's Y_oc=1.41e-3.

So looking at option G: Turns ratio=5.82, R=3120 ohms, Y_oc=1.41e-3, |b_mag|=1.374e-3, |X_mag|=727 ohms, r1' + r2=0.303 ohm, |X_sc|=2.28 ohm.

But earlier, I thought the turns ratio is exactly 6, but option G has a=5.82. That's a problem. How can a be 5.82 when the voltage ratio is exactly 6?

Wait, perhaps the turns ratio is not exactly 6 because of the test data. Let me calculate a from the test data.

The open circuit test on the secondary: V_oc=2,200 V, I0=3.1 A. So the magnetizing reactance X_mag_secondary=2,200 /3.1≈709.68 ohms.

The short circuit test on the secondary: V_sc=210 V, I_sc=90.9 A. So the short circuit current on the secondary is 90.9 A, which would correspond to the armature current. The armature reactance X_arm= V_sc / I_sc =210 /90.9≈2.31 ohms.

Wait, but that's the armature reactance on the secondary side. Then, the total leakage reactance is X_leakage_secondary= X_arm=2.31 ohms. When referred to the primary, X_leakage_primary= a^2 * X_leakage_secondary= (a^2)*2.31.

But I'm not sure if that's relevant here.

Alternatively, perhaps the turns ratio a can be found from the short circuit test. From the short circuit test on the secondary, the current is I_sc_secondary=90.9 A, which would cause the primary current I_sc_primary= I_sc_secondary /a. But the short circuit test on the primary would have a different setup.

I'm getting too stuck here. Let me try to make an educated guess based on the options. The correct answer likely has a=6, X_mag around 710 ohms, Y_oc around 1.4e-3 mho, and R_total' around 0.3 ohms.

Looking at the options:

Option A: a=6, R=2900, Y_oc=1.55e-3, X_mag=710, r_total'=0.32.

Option D: a=5.90, R=3300, Y_oc=1.35e-3, X_mag=720, r_total'=0.305.

Option G: a=5.82, R=3120, Y_oc=1.41e-3, X_mag=727, r_total'=0.303.

Option I: a=6, R=3500, Y_oc=1.10e-3, X_mag=800.

Option B: a=5.70, R=3100, Y_oc=1.45e-3, X_mag=730, r_total'=0.295.

From earlier calculations, Y_oc should be around 1.409e-3, which is closest to option G's Y_oc=1.41e-3. But option G has a=5.82, which is close to 6 but not exact. Alternatively, option A's Y_oc is 1.55e-3, which is a bit higher than our calculated 1.409e-3.

But since the turns ratio is exactly 6, I think option A is more likely correct despite the slight discrepancy in Y_oc. Alternatively, perhaps the question intended for the turns ratio to be calculated from the test data, not from the given voltage ratio.

Wait, perhaps the turns ratio can be calculated from the open circuit test. The open circuit test on the secondary gives I0_secondary=3.1 A, V_oc_secondary=2,200 V. The magnetizing reactance X_mag_secondary=2,200 /3.1≈709.68 ohms.

The short circuit test on the secondary gives V_sc_secondary=210 V, I_sc_secondary=90.9 A. The armature reactance X_arm_secondary=210 /90.9≈2.31 ohms.

The total reactance on the secondary side is X_total_secondary= X_mag_secondary + X_arm_secondary≈709.68 +2.31≈712 ohms.

When referred to the primary, X_total_primary= a^2 * X_total_secondary=36 *712≈25,632 ohms. But that's not helpful here.

Alternatively, the turns ratio can be found from the short circuit test. The short circuit current on the secondary is I_sc_secondary=90.9 A, which is the full-load current on the secondary side. The full-load current on the primary side is I_sc_primary= I_sc_secondary /a.

The full-load current on the secondary is I2 = V2 / Z2, where Z2 is the impedance. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the short circuit test on the secondary gives the armature reactance X_arm_secondary=2.31 ohms as calculated earlier. The armature reactance on the primary side is X_arm_primary= a^2 * X_arm_secondary=36 *2.31≈83.16 ohms.

But I'm not sure how that helps with the turns ratio.

I think I've exhausted all approaches and must make a best guess. Based on the X_mag=710 ohms matching option A, and the turns ratio a=6, I think option A is the correct answer.

The problem involves determining the parameters of the T-equivalent circuit for a transformer referred to the low voltage winding. The transformer has a rating of 200 kVA, 13,200/2,200 V, 60 Hz, and the test data includes open-circuit and short-circuit measurements. The analysis proceeds as follows:

1. **Turns Ratio Calculation**:  
   The turns ratio \( a \) is calculated as the ratio of the primary voltage to the secondary voltage:  
   \[
   a = \frac{13,200}{2,200} = 6
   \]  
   This matches options A, D, and I.

2. **Open-Circuit Test**:  
   The open-circuit test data provides the magnetizing current \( I_0 = 3.1 \, \text{A} \) and core loss \( P_{\text{fe}} = 1,550 \, \text{W} \). The magnetizing reactance on the secondary side is:  
   \[
   X_{\text{mag, secondary}} = \frac{V_{\text{oc}}}{I_0} = \frac{2,200}{3.1} \approx 709.68 \, \Omega
   \]  
   This matches the magnetizing reactance values in options A, D, and G.

3. **Short-Circuit Test**:  
   The short-circuit test data provides \( V_{\text{sc}} = 210 \, \text{V} \), \( I_{\text{sc}} = 90.9 \, \text{A} \), and \( P_{\text{c}} = 2,500 \, \text{W} \). The resistance on the secondary side is:  
   \[
   R_{\text{2}} = \frac{V_{\text{sc}}^2}{P_{\text{c}}} = \frac{210^2}{2,500} \approx 17.64 \, \Omega
   \]  
   The resistance on the primary side is:  
   \[
   R_{\text{1}} = a^2 \cdot R_{\text{2}} = 36 \cdot 17.64 \approx 635 \, \Omega
   \]  
   When referred to the low voltage side, the total resistance is:  
   \[
   R_{\text{total}}' = R_{\text{2}} + \frac{R_{\text{1}}}{a^2} = 17.64 + \frac{635}{36} \approx 35.28 \, \Omega
   \]  
   However, this value does not match any option, suggesting a discrepancy in the interpretation of the test data.

4. **Analysis of Options**:  
   - **Option A**: Matches the turns ratio \( a = 6 \) and \( X_{\text{mag}} = 710 \, \Omega \). The open-circuit admittance \( Y_{\text{oc}} = 1.55 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{mho} \) is slightly higher than the calculated \( Y_{\text{oc}} = 1.409 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{mho} \).  
   - **Option G**: Has \( a = 5.82 \), which is close to 6, and \( Y_{\text{oc}} = 1.41 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{mho} \), which matches the calculated value. However, the turns ratio deviation from 6 reduces its likelihood.  
   - **Option D**: Has \( a = 5.90 \), which is close to 6, but the magnetizing reactance \( X_{\text{mag}} = 720 \, \Omega \) and open-circuit admittance \( Y_{\text{oc}} = 1.35 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{mho} \) do not fully align with the calculations.  

5. **Conclusion**:  
   Despite minor discrepancies, option A is the most consistent with the calculated turns ratio \( a = 6 \) and magnetizing reactance \( X_{\text{mag}} = 710 \, \Omega \). The slight difference in \( Y_{\text{oc}} \) may be due to rounding or test data approximations.
