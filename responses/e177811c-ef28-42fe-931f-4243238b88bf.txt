Okay, so I have this chemistry question here, and I need to figure out which process is an irreversible reaction. The options are A through I, and I need to pick the correct one. Let's see, I remember that irreversible reactions don't reach equilibrium because they go to completion. So, the products don't form a significant amount of reactants because the forward reaction is favored completely.

First, I should probably go through each option one by one and think about each reaction.

Option A: H2(g) + I2(g) ↔ 2HI(g). Hmm, I think this is a reversible reaction because I remember that the dissociation of HI can go both ways. Wait, no, actually, this is the formation of HI from H2 and I2. I think this reaction does reach equilibrium, so it's reversible. So A is reversible.

Option B: HCN(aq) + H2O(l) → CN-(aq) + H3O+(aq). HCN is a weak acid, right? So it doesn't completely dissociate in water. Wait, but this reaction shows it dissociating completely. Wait, no, wait. The arrow is a single arrow, which suggests it's a one-way reaction. But in reality, weak acids only partially dissociate. So maybe this reaction is written as if it's going to completion, but in reality, it's reversible. Wait, but the question is asking which is irreversible. Maybe this is written as a one-way because it's assumed to go to completion, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a strong acid, but I don't think HCN is strong. So maybe this reaction is reversible but written as if it's going to completion. Hmm, not sure yet.

Option C: 2H2O(l) ↔ 2H2(g) + O2(g). This is the decomposition of water into hydrogen and oxygen. I remember that this reaction doesn't go to completion because it's endothermic and requires a lot of energy. So in reality, it doesn't proceed much, meaning it's reversible but doesn't go to completion. So the process is reversible, but the reaction doesn't proceed much in the forward direction. So C is a reversible reaction that doesn't go far, but the question is about whether the process is irreversible. Wait, no, because the reaction can go both ways, so it's reversible. So C is not the answer.

Option D: 2Ag+(aq) + Ti(s) → 2Ag(s) + Ti2+(aq). This looks like a redox reaction. Silver ions are being reduced to silver metal, and titanium is oxidized to Ti²+ ions. Since metals like titanium can displace less active metals like silver from their ions, this reaction is likely to proceed to completion because the metals involved have different standard reduction potentials. The more active metal (titanium) displaces the less active one (silver). So this reaction is irreversible because it goes to completion, favoring the products. So D might be the correct answer.

Option E: PCl5(g) ↔ PCl3(g) + Cl2(g). I think this is a reversible reaction because PCl5 can decompose into PCl3 and Cl2, but it doesn't go to completion. So E is reversible.

Option F: CH3COOH(l) + CH3OH(l) ↔ CH3COOCH3(l) + H2O(l). This is an esterification reaction, which is a reversible reaction. It can go both ways, so F is reversible.

Option G: H2(g) + Cl2(g) ↔ 2HCl(g). This is a combustion reaction. I think it's highly exothermic and goes to completion, so it's irreversible. Wait, but wait, no, wait. In reality, the reaction of H2 and Cl2 forms HCl, and it's a very exothermic reaction. But is it reversible? I think it's reversible because under certain conditions, HCl can decompose back into H2 and Cl2, but in practice, it's driven so far forward that it's considered almost irreversible. Hmm, but maybe in this context, the reaction is considered reversible because it can go both ways, even if the reverse is not significant. So G is a reversible reaction.

Option H: N2(g) + 3H2(g) ↔ 2NH3(g). The Haber process. This is a reversible reaction because NH3 can decompose back into N2 and H2 under high temperatures, so H is reversible.

Option I: CH4(g) + O2(g) → CO2(g) + H2O(l). This is the combustion of methane, which is a highly exothermic reaction. Combustion reactions typically go to completion because they're exothermic and don't have an easy reverse path. So this reaction is irreversible because it doesn't reach equilibrium; it goes to completion. So I is an irreversible reaction.

Wait, but I thought D was irreversible as well. Let me think again. So the question is which process is irreversible, meaning it doesn't reach equilibrium. So looking at D and I.

D: 2Ag+ + Ti → 2Ag + Ti²+. Since Ti is more active than Ag, this reaction should proceed to completion, making D an irreversible reaction.

I: CH4 + O2 → CO2 + H2O. Combustion reactions are typically irreversible because they proceed to completion, so I is also irreversible.

Wait, but the options only have one correct answer. So which one is more likely to be considered irreversible? Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, let's clarify. Irreversible reactions don't have an equilibrium; they go to completion. So both D and I are such reactions.

But wait, looking back, I think in the options, only I is a combustion reaction. Let me check the options again.

Wait, option D: 2Ag+ + Ti → 2Ag + Ti²+. This is a displacement reaction where Ti reduces Ag+ to Ag metal. Since Ti is more reactive, this reaction is spontaneous and goes to completion, making D irreversible.

Option I: Methane combustion produces CO2 and water. Since combustion is a one-way process, it's irreversible.

So both D and I are irreversible. But the options only have one correct answer. So perhaps I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, let me think again. The question is which process is irreversible. So which of these reactions doesn't reach equilibrium and goes to completion.

Looking back at the options, I think both D and I are irreversible. But perhaps in the options, only I is considered, or perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, but the options are letters A to I, and the correct answer is one of them. So perhaps I should think again.

Wait, in the options, option I is a combustion reaction, which is definitely irreversible. So I is the answer.

Wait, but earlier I thought D is also irreversible. So perhaps both are correct, but the question is designed so that only one is correct.

Alternatively, maybe I confused the options. Let me check again.

Wait, the options are:

I: CH4(g) + O2(g) → CO2(g) + H2O(l)

Yes, combustion, which is irreversible.

So the correct answer is I.

Wait, but earlier I thought D is also irreversible. Hmm. Let me think about the standard reactions.

In D, the reaction is 2Ag+ + Ti → 2Ag + Ti²+. Since Ti is a more active metal, it displaces Ag from AgNO3 solution, and this reaction is typically considered to go to completion, making it irreversible.

So both D and I are irreversible reactions. But since the options are A to I, perhaps the correct answer is I, as combustion is a classic example of an irreversible reaction.

Wait, but the question says "which of the following processes is an irreversible reaction?" So perhaps both D and I are correct, but the options don't allow for multiple choices. So perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis.

Alternatively, perhaps I should check the standard lists of irreversible reactions. From what I remember, reactions like combustion (option I), precipitation reactions, and some redox reactions where a more active metal displaces a less active one (like D) are considered irreversible.

Wait, but in the options, which one is correct? The question asks for the process that is irreversible.

Looking at the options again, perhaps I is the correct answer because it's a well-known irreversible reaction.

But earlier I thought both D and I are correct. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the answer is I, because it's a combustion reaction, which is a classic example of an irreversible reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is D. Wait, I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, another approach: irreversible reactions are those that do not form an equilibrium. So, for example, when a solid is formed from ions in solution, like a precipitation reaction, or when a reaction goes to completion because the products are stable.

In D, the reaction is between Ag+ and Ti. The formation of solid Ag and Ti²+ ions in solution. Since Ti is more active, it should completely reduce Ag+ to Ag metal. So this reaction is irreversible.

Similarly, in I, the combustion reaction is highly exothermic and goes to completion, making it irreversible.

So both D and I are irreversible. But the options don't have both as correct. So perhaps the question expects one of them.

Wait, looking back, the options are A through I, and the correct answer is I.

Wait, perhaps I should check the options again.

Wait, the options are:

I: CH4(g) + O2(g) → CO2(g) + H2O(l)

Yes, that's the combustion reaction, which is irreversible.

So the correct answer is I.

The question asks which process is an irreversible reaction. Irreversible reactions do not reach equilibrium and proceed to completion. Here's the analysis of each option:

- **A**: The reaction between H₂, I₂, and HI is reversible as it can go both ways, forming and dissociating HI.
- **B**: HCN dissociating in water is a reversible reaction, even though it is a weak acid.
- **C**: The decomposition of water into H₂ and O₂ is reversible but does not proceed much due to high energy requirements.
- **D**: The reaction between Ag⁺ and Ti is a redox reaction where Ti displaces Ag, proceeding to completion, making it irreversible.
- **E**: The decomposition of PCl₅ is a reversible reaction as it can form and break down into PCl₃ and Cl₂.
- **F**: Esterification is a reversible reaction that can go both ways.
- **G**: The reaction between H₂ and Cl₂ to form HCl is highly exothermic but still reversible under certain conditions.
- **H**: The Haber process for ammonia synthesis is reversible, as NH₃ can decompose back into N₂ and H₂.
- **I**: The combustion of CH₄ is a classic example of an irreversible reaction, as it proceeds to completion due to its high exothermic nature.

Both **D** and **I** are irreversible reactions. However, since the question asks for a single answer, **I** is the most well-known example of an irreversible reaction.

Answer: I
