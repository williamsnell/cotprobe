Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me read it again: the frequency of males affected with an X-linked recessive condition is 0.10, which is one in ten. I need to find the expected frequency of affected females.

Hmm, I remember that X-linked recessive conditions affect males more often because they only have one X chromosome. Females have two X chromosomes, so they need two defective copies to show the condition. But wait, how does that translate into frequencies?

I think the formula for the frequency of affected males and females is different. For males, it's straightforward because they have only one X. So if the allele frequency is q, then the frequency of affected males is just q. But for females, since they need two copies, the frequency should be q squared, right?

Wait, but wait. Let me get this straight. The condition is X-linked recessive. So let's say the recessive allele is 'a' and the dominant is 'A'. Males only need one 'a' to be affected because they have only one X. So the frequency of affected males is q.

Females have two X's, so they need both to be 'a' to be affected. So the frequency of affected females would be q squared, because the probability of getting 'a' from both parents is q times q.

But wait, the question gives the frequency of affected males as 0.10. So q is 0.10. Then the frequency of affected females should be q squared, which is 0.10^2 = 0.01.

Wait a minute, but I've heard sometimes that the frequency of carriers (like females who are carriers) is different, but in this case, we're only looking for affected females, not carriers. Carriers are females with one 'a' and one 'A', so they're not affected. Affected females have two 'a's.

So if q is 0.1, then the female affected frequency is q², which is 0.01. Looking at the options, option B is 0.01. But wait, another thought: is there any other factor I'm missing, like Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium?

In Hardy-Weinberg, the genotype frequencies are p² (AA), 2pq (Aa), and q² (aa) for females. So the frequency of affected females is q², which is 0.01 in this case. So the answer should be B: 0.01.

Wait, but sometimes people get confused between the frequencies of males and females. Because males' frequency is q, and females' is q². So if males are 0.1, females are 0.01. That makes sense. So the answer is B.
</think>

The frequency of affected males with an X-linked recessive condition is given as 0.10. Since males have only one X chromosome, the frequency of the recessive allele (q) is 0.10. For females to be affected, they must inherit two copies of the recessive allele, making the frequency of affected females \( q^2 \). Calculating \( q^2 \) gives \( 0.10^2 = 0.01 \). Therefore, the expected frequency of affected females is 0.01.

Answer: B
