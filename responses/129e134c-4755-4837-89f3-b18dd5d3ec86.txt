Question:

An investor owned a building in a city. This was the only piece of real estate that the investor owned. The three-story building had a store on the ground floor and apartments on the other two floors. The investor entered into a leasehold agreement with a tenant, who would lease the first floor, where she planned to open a sporting goods store. After identifying the parties, the operative words of the lease were as follows: "Landlord hereby agrees to lease for the three years the first floor of his building in the city to tenant, reserving unto said landlord annual rental in the sum of $12,000 payable in advance in monthly installments of $1,000. "After the tenant took possession and the investor accepted her rent payment for the first floor of the building, which of the following most accurately describes the legal relationship between the parties?

Options:

A: A joint tenancy was created.
B: The tenant became the freeholder of the property.
C: The tenant's equitable three-year term became a legal three-year term.
D: The tenant became a subtenant of the investor.
E: A tenancy at sufferance was created.
F: A periodic tenancy from month-to-month was created.
G: The tenant's three-year term became a periodic tenancy.
H: A tenancy at will was created.
I: A periodic tenancy from year-to-year was created.

Okay, so I've got this question about lease agreements and property law. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

The scenario is an investor who owns a building. It's a three-story building with a store on the ground floor and apartments above. The investor, who is the landlord, leased the first floor to a tenant who wants to open a sporting goods store. The lease agreement says the landlord agrees to lease the first floor for three years, with an annual rental of $12,000, paid in advance in monthly installments of $1,000.

So after the tenant takes possession and pays the rent, what's the legal relationship between them? The options are A to I, and I need to pick the correct one.

First, I should recall the different types of tenancies. There are leasehold estates, which are the different types of tenancies based on the terms of the lease. The main ones I remember are:

1. **Tenancy for years**: This is a lease for a specific period, like three years. It automatically terminates at the end of the term unless renewed.
2. **Periodic tenancy**: This continues beyond the initial term and renews for a set period (like month-to-month or year-to-year) until one party gives notice to terminate.
3. **Tenancy at will**: This is an agreement that can be terminated by either party at any time without cause, usually with notice.
4. **Tenancy at sufferance**: This is when a tenant continues to occupy the property after the lease has ended, without the landlord's permission. It's a bit of a tricky situation because the tenant is technically trespassing but has a right to stay until evicted.

Looking back at the lease agreement, it's a three-year lease with a fixed amount. The lease says it's for three years, so that makes me think it's a tenancy for years. The rent is paid monthly in advance, but that shouldn't affect the type of tenancy; it's just about how the rent is structured.

Option C says the tenant's equitable term became a legal term. Hmm, equitable vs. legal. I think an equitable lease is one where the tenant has an equitable interest, like in a leasehold estate, but once the lease is executed, it becomes a legal lease. So maybe C is correct because the lease was created, giving the tenant a legal three-year term.

But let me look at the other options. Option F is a periodic tenancy from month-to-month. That would be if the lease didn't specify a term but instead continued month by month. But here, it's a three-year lease, so that's not the case.

Option I is a periodic tenancy from year to year. That would happen if the lease was for a year and then automatically renewed yearly. But again, the lease is for a fixed three years, so that's not applicable.

Option G suggests the three-year term became a periodic tenancy. That seems similar to F and I, which don't fit because the term is fixed.

Options A, B, D, E, H: A joint tenancy is when two people own property together, which isn't the case here. B says the tenant became the freeholder, which would mean they own the property outright, but that's not what a lease does. D says the tenant is a subtenant, but the investor owns the whole building, and the tenant is leasing the first floor directly, so not a subtenant. E is a tenancy at sufferance, which is after the lease ends, so no. H is tenancy at will, which allows either party to end it anytime, but the lease here is for a specific term, so that's not right.

So the correct one should be C: The tenant's equitable three-year term became a legal three-year term. Because when the lease is executed, the equitable interest (like the right to possession) becomes a legal lease with a definite term.

The correct answer is C: The tenant's equitable three-year term became a legal three-year term. The lease agreement specifies a three-year term, which establishes a legal leasehold estate, making the tenant's interest a legal three-year term.

C
