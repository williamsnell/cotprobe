Okay, so I've got this question about Lissajous patterns on an oscilloscope. Hmm, I remember Lissajous figures are those cool patterns that form when you have two signals on an oscilloscope, one on the x-axis and one on the y-axis. The shape depends on the ratio of their frequencies and the phase difference.

The question says the horizontal tangency is 5 and the vertical is 2. Wait, tangency... Oh right, tangency refers to how many times the pattern touches the edges of the screen. So if the horizontal has 5, that's the number of times it hits the right or left edges. Similarly, vertical tangency is 2, so top and bottom.

I think the number of tangencies relates to the number of cycles each signal goes through. For horizontal, each cycle would cause two tangencies—like, when the sine wave goes up and down, each peak would hit the edge. Or wait, maybe each tangency is an extremum point, like the maximum and minimum. So if it's 5 horizontal tangencies, that's like 5/2 cycles? Or maybe it's the number of peaks. Wait, no, actually, each full cycle would have two tangencies—one when it's at max positive and one at max negative. So if there are 5 horizontal tangencies, that would mean 5/2 = 2.5 cycles? Wait, that doesn't make much sense because cycles are whole numbers. Maybe I'm thinking about it wrong.

Wait, I recall that the number of tangencies corresponds to the number of points where the curve touches the axis, which relates to the number of maxima and minima each signal has. So for horizontal, 5 tangencies would mean that the horizontal signal has 5/2 cycles? Because each cycle has two tangencies (positive and negative peaks). So 5 tangencies would be 2.5 cycles. Similarly, 2 vertical tangencies would be 1 cycle.

But wait, that doesn't seem right because cycles should be integers. Maybe I'm getting this wrong. Another way: the number of horizontal tangencies is equal to the number of times the horizontal signal completes a half-cycle. So for example, if the horizontal has a frequency of f_x, then in the time it takes for the vertical signal to complete one cycle (f_y), the horizontal completes f_x * (1/f_y) cycles. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, no, I think the correct approach is to consider the ratio of the frequencies based on the number of tangencies. The number of horizontal tangencies is 5, and vertical is 2. So the horizontal has more tangencies, meaning it's oscillating faster. The ratio of frequencies would be the ratio of the number of tangencies. So f_x / f_y = 5/2. Wait, but wait, the horizontal tangency is 5, vertical is 2. So if the horizontal has 5, and vertical 2, then the frequency ratio is 5/2. Because for each cycle of the vertical, the horizontal does 5/2 cycles. So f_x is 100 Hz, so f_y = f_x * (2/5). Let me check that.

Wait, the formula I remember is that the ratio of frequencies is equal to the ratio of the number of horizontal to vertical tangencies. So if the horizontal has 'a' tangencies and vertical 'b', then f_x / f_y = a / b. So in this case, a=5, b=2. So f_x = 100 Hz, so f_y = (f_x * b) / a = (100 * 2)/5 = 40 Hz. But wait, none of the options are 40 Hz. Hmm, that's a problem.

Wait, maybe I had it backwards. Maybe the ratio is f_y / f_x = a / b? Let me think again. If the horizontal has more tangencies, that suggests a higher frequency. So if the horizontal is faster, then f_x is higher. So f_x / f_y = a/b =5/2. So f_y = (2/5)*f_x = (2/5)*100=40 Hz. But again, 40 isn't an option. Hmm, maybe I got the ratio wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio is the number of vertical tangencies over horizontal. So f_y / f_x = b/a = 2/5. So f_y = (2/5)*100=40. Still the same issue. Wait, but the options don't have 40. Let's see the options: A is 750, B 250, C 625, D 500, E 800, F 400, G 200, H 900, I 350, J 150. None of these match 40.

Wait, maybe I'm interpreting tangency wrong. Perhaps the number of tangencies is the number of cycles each signal completes during the time the other completes one cycle. So if horizontal has 5 tangencies, that would be 5/2 cycles per same time as the vertical's 2 tangencies, which is 1 cycle. So the horizontal's frequency is (5/2) times the vertical's frequency. So f_x = (5/2) * f_y. Since f_x is 100 Hz, then f_y = (100 * 2)/5 = 40 Hz. Still 40, which isn't an option. Hmm. So maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the number of tangencies equals the number of cycles times 2. Because each cycle has a positive and negative peak, hence two tangencies. So if horizontal has 5 tangencies, that's 5/2 = 2.5 cycles. Similarly, vertical with 2 tangencies is 1 cycle. So the ratio of frequencies would be 2.5 / 1 = 2.5. So f_x / f_y = 2.5 → f_y = f_x / 2.5 = 100 / 2.5 = 40 Hz. Still not an option. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of horizontal tangencies is the number of cycles, not multiplied by 2. So if horizontal has 5 tangencies, that's 5 cycles, and vertical has 2, which is 2 cycles. Then the frequency ratio is 5/2. So f_y = (2/5)*f_x = (2/5)*100=40 Hz. Again, same result. But the options don't have 40. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, maybe the tangency counts are the number of points where the curve touches the axis, which corresponds to the number of maxima and minima. So for a sine wave, each cycle has one maximum and one minimum, so 2 points. So if horizontal has 5, that's 5/2 cycles. Similarly, vertical with 2 is 1 cycle. Thus, the frequency ratio is (5/2)/1 = 2.5. So f_y = f_x / 2.5 = 40 Hz. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the ratio is the reciprocal. If f_x / f_y = 5/2, then f_y = (2/5)*100=40. But again, 40 isn't an option. Maybe I'm getting the ratio wrong. Maybe the ratio is the number of vertical tangencies to horizontal, so f_y / f_x = 2/5. Then f_y=40. But that's not an option.

Wait, looking at the options, perhaps I made a mistake in the ratio. Let me think again. If the horizontal has more tangencies, it's a higher frequency. So f_x is 100 Hz, and the vertical has fewer, so f_y is lower. But the options have higher and lower values. Let me check the options again.

Wait, the options are A:750, B:250, C:625, D:500, E:800, F:400, G:200, H:900, I:350, J:150. So 40 isn't there. Hmm. Maybe I got the ratio the other way. If the horizontal has 5 tangencies, which is more than vertical's 2, then the horizontal frequency is higher. So the ratio is 5/2, so f_x =5/2 * f_y. So 100= (5/2)f_y → f_y= (100*2)/5=40. Still 40, not in options.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the number of horizontal tangencies is the number of times the x signal completes a full cycle. So 5 tangencies would be 5 cycles. Similarly, vertical is 2. So the ratio is 5/2. So f_x / f_y =5/2 → f_y= (2/5)*100=40. Again, same result. So maybe I'm missing something in the question.

Wait, perhaps the tangency counts are the number of lobes or something else. Alternatively, maybe the number of tangencies is the number of times the signal reaches its maximum amplitude, which would be once per cycle. So for a sine wave, each cycle has one maximum. So 5 horizontal tangencies would mean 5 cycles, and vertical 2 tangencies is 2 cycles. So the ratio is 5/2. So f_x=100 Hz, so f_y= (2/5)*100=40 Hz. Still stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio is the reciprocal. Maybe f_y / f_x =5/2 → f_y=250 Hz. Because 100*(5/2)=250. Wait, that's option B. Because if the ratio is 5/2, then f_y= (5/2)*f_x=250 Hz. But that would mean the vertical frequency is higher, which would make sense if the vertical has fewer tangencies. Wait, no, because if vertical has fewer tangencies, it's lower frequency.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let's think differently. The number of horizontal tangencies is 5, and vertical is 2. The Lissajous pattern's shape depends on the ratio of the frequencies. If the horizontal has more tangencies, it's a higher frequency. So the ratio of f_x to f_y is equal to the ratio of the number of horizontal to vertical tangencies. So f_x/f_y =5/2. Since f_x is 100 Hz, then f_y= (2/5)*100=40 Hz. But that's not an option.

Wait, maybe the ratio is the other way around. If f_y/f_x =5/2, then f_y=100*(5/2)=250 Hz. That's option B. But why would that be the case? Because the number of tangencies is higher for the horizontal, but if the vertical frequency is higher, then vertical tangencies would be more. That doesn't make sense. So I'm probably getting the ratio wrong.

Wait, perhaps the ratio is the number of vertical tangencies divided by horizontal. So f_y/f_x=2/5. So f_y= (2/5)*100=40. Still not matching any options.

Wait, maybe the number of tangencies is the number of times each signal completes a half-cycle. So for a full cycle, it's two half-cycles, each causing a tangency. So 5 horizontal tangencies would be 5 half-cycles, which is 2.5 full cycles. Similarly, 2 vertical tangencies would be 1 full cycle. So the ratio f_x/f_y=2.5/1=2.5. So f_y=100/2.5=40 Hz. Still no match.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of tangencies is the number of full cycles. So 5 horizontal tangencies would be 5 cycles, 2 vertical tangencies would be 2 cycles. Then f_x=100 Hz, so f_y= (2/5)*100=40 Hz. Again, same issue.

Wait, maybe the ratio is the number of vertical tangencies to horizontal, so f_y/f_x=2/5, so f_y=40. Not in options. Alternatively, maybe it's f_x/f_y=2/5, so f_x= (2/5)f_y → 100= (2/5)f_y → f_y=250 Hz. That's option B. But why would the ratio be 2/5? Because horizontal has 5 tangencies, vertical 2. So perhaps the ratio is 5/2 for f_x to f_y. So f_y= (2/5)*100=40.

Wait, but 40 isn't an option. So maybe I'm making a mistake in the ratio. Let me think about the Lissajous formula. The equations are x = A sin(ω_x t) and y = B sin(ω_y t + φ). The number of times the curve touches the horizontal axis (x extremes) is determined by ω_x, and similarly for vertical.

The number of horizontal tangencies is the number of times x reaches its maximum or minimum, which is twice per cycle. So if there are 5 horizontal tangencies, that's 5/2 cycles. Similarly, vertical tangencies are 2/2=1 cycle. So the ratio of frequencies is (5/2) / 1 = 5/2. So f_x / f_y =5/2 → f_y= (2/5)*100=40 Hz. Still not matching.

Wait, but maybe the ratio is the number of vertical tangencies over horizontal, so 2/5. So f_y/f_x=2/5 → f_y=40. No match. Alternatively, perhaps the ratio is horizontal over vertical, so 5/2, making f_y= (2/5)*100=40.

Wait, perhaps the ratio is the other way around. If the horizontal has 5 tangencies and vertical 2, the frequency of the vertical is 5/2 times the horizontal. So f_y= (5/2)*100=250 Hz. That's option B. But why would the vertical frequency be higher if it has fewer tangencies? That doesn't make sense because a higher frequency would result in more tangencies.

Wait, maybe the number of tangencies is the number of oscillations, so 5 for horizontal and 2 for vertical. So the ratio f_x/f_y=5/2. So f_y= (2/5)*100=40. Still no match. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscounting the tangencies. Maybe each time the wave goes from positive to negative or vice versa, that's a tangency. So for a full sine wave, there are two tangencies: one at the peak and one at the trough. So 5 tangencies would mean 5/2=2.5 cycles. Similarly, 2 tangencies would be 1 cycle. So the ratio is 2.5/1=2.5. So f_y= f_x /2.5=40 Hz. Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of tangencies is the number of times the wave touches the axis, which is once per cycle for each direction. So 5 tangencies would be 5/2 cycles. Wait, I'm going in circles here.

Wait, maybe the question is referring to the number of times the curve touches the horizontal and vertical axes, not the axes of the oscilloscope. So for example, the horizontal axis (x) is touched when y is at max or min, but that's not the case. Wait, no, the tangency refers to the points where the curve is tangent to the axes. So for Lissajous figures, the number of points where the curve is tangent to the horizontal axis is equal to the number of times the x signal crosses its maximum and minimum, which is twice per cycle. So 5 tangencies would be 5/2 cycles. Similarly, vertical tangency is 2, so 1 cycle.

So the ratio of frequencies is (5/2) cycles per 1 cycle, meaning f_x/f_y=5/2. So f_y= (2/5)*100=40 Hz. But 40 isn't an option. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the question is reversed. Maybe the horizontal tangency is the number of times the x signal completes a cycle, so 5 cycles, and vertical is 2 cycles. So the ratio f_x/f_y=5/2. So f_y= (2/5)*100=40. Again, same issue.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio is f_y/f_x=5/2, so f_y=250 Hz. That's option B. But why would that be the case? Because if the horizontal has more tangencies, it's higher frequency. So f_x is higher than f_y. So f_y would be lower than f_x. So 250 Hz is higher than 100 Hz, which contradicts. So that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscounting the tangencies. Let me think of an example. Suppose the horizontal has 2 tangencies and vertical has 1. Then the ratio is 2/1=2, so f_x=2*f_y. If f_x=200 Hz, f_y=100 Hz. But in our case, it's 5 and 2. So f_x=5/2 *f_y. So f_y= (2/5)*100=40. Still no match.

Wait, perhaps the ratio is the reciprocal. Let me think: if the number of horizontal tangencies is 5 and vertical is 2, then the horizontal is faster. So f_x= (5/2)*f_y. So f_y= (2/5)*f_x=40 Hz. Still stuck.

Wait, perhaps the ratio is based on the least common multiple. The number of cycles should be such that after LCM(5,2)=10 tangencies, the pattern repeats. But I'm not sure how that helps.

Alternatively, maybe the number of tangencies is the number of times each signal completes a half-cycle. So for horizontal, 5 tangencies is 5 half-cycles, which is 2.5 cycles. Vertical is 2 half-cycles, which is 1 cycle. So f_x/f_y=2.5/1=2.5. So f_y=40 Hz.

Wait, but the options don't have 40. Maybe the question has a typo, or I'm misunderstanding something. Alternatively, perhaps the number of tangencies is the number of times the curve touches the axis, which for a Lissajous figure with a horizontal and vertical signal, the number of horizontal tangencies is equal to the number of vertical cycles, and vice versa. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the number of horizontal tangencies is equal to the number of vertical cycles, and vice versa. So if horizontal has 5 tangencies, that's 5 vertical cycles, and vertical has 2 tangencies, which is 2 horizontal cycles. So the ratio of frequencies would be f_x/f_y=5/2. So f_y= (2/5)*100=40 Hz. Still same.

Wait, but perhaps the ratio is f_y/f_x=5/2. So f_y=250 Hz. That's option B. But that would mean the vertical frequency is higher, which would have more tangencies. But vertical only has 2. That doesn't make sense. So I'm stuck.

Wait, maybe the answer is 250 Hz (option B). But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe I should think about the pattern. A Lissajous pattern with 5 horizontal and 2 vertical tangencies would form a pattern that repeats every 2 cycles of the vertical and 5 of the horizontal. So the ratio is 5:2, meaning f_x=5n and f_y=2n. Given f_x=100, so 5n=100 →n=20. So f_y=2n=40 Hz. But again, 40 isn't an option.

Wait, unless I've made a mistake in the ratio. If the ratio is 2:5, then f_x=2n, f_y=5n. So 2n=100 →n=50. So f_y=5*50=250 Hz. That's option B. But that would mean the vertical frequency is higher, which would have more tangencies. But the question says vertical has only 2. So I'm getting conflicting results.

Hmm, perhaps the answer intended is 250 Hz, option B. But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, maybe I should consider the number of tangencies as the number of cycles, so 5 for horizontal and 2 for vertical, making the ratio 5/2. So f_y= (2/5)*100=40. But since 40 isn't an option, perhaps the intended answer is 250 Hz, considering the reciprocal ratio, even though it doesn't make sense physically.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of tangencies is the number of cycles, so 5 for horizontal and 2 for vertical. So the ratio is 5/2, making f_y= (2/5)*100=40. Still same problem.

Wait, perhaps the ratio is the number of vertical tangencies to horizontal, so 2/5. So f_y= (2/5)*100=40. Not an option. I'm stuck. Maybe the intended answer is 250 Hz, option B, as it's the only one that comes from a reciprocal ratio. But I'm not sure.

The question involves determining the vertical frequency in a Lissajous pattern with 5 horizontal tangencies and 2 vertical tangencies, given the horizontal frequency is 100 Hz. Lissajous patterns depend on the ratio of the frequencies of the input signals. The number of tangencies corresponds to the number of times the signal reaches its maximum or minimum, which is twice per cycle for each signal.

For the horizontal signal with 5 tangencies, this implies \( \frac{5}{2} \) cycles, and for the vertical signal with 2 tangencies, this implies 1 cycle. The ratio of frequencies is therefore \( \frac{f_x}{f_y} = \frac{5/2}{1} = \frac{5}{2} \). Rearranging for \( f_y \), we get \( f_y = \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40 \, \text{Hz} \). However, 40 Hz is not among the provided options.

Considering the possibility of a reciprocal ratio, if \( \frac{f_y}{f_x} = \frac{5}{2} \), then \( f_y = \frac{5}{2} \times 100 = 250 \, \text{Hz} \). This matches option B. While this ratio seems counterintuitive given the tangency counts, it aligns with the provided options. Thus, the most reasonable choice is:

**Answer: B**
