Question:

Consider a profit-maximizing firm in a perfectly competitive market with several sellers and several buyers (i.e., the firm is a "price taker" of the goods it sells and a "price taker" of the hourly wages it pays its workers). If a technological innovation made by someone in this firm were to significantly raise the firm's marginal physical product (but not that of any other firm's), then this innovation would

Options:

A: lead the firm to reduce workers' wages as they now contribute less marginal revenue
B: lead the firm to hire more workers but not to raise their wages
C: reduce the firm's employment level but raise workers' wages
D: lead the firm to hire more workers and to pay them higher wages
E: raise the workers’ hourly wage as they now contribute more marginal revenue
F: reduce the firm's employment level and lower workers' wages
G: cause the firm to hire fewer workers but pay them higher wages
H: lead the firm to hire the same number of workers but pay them higher wages
I: reduce the firm’s employment level, because fewer workers are now needed
J: have no effect on the firm's employment level or workers' wages

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this economics question about a profit-maximizing firm in a perfectly competitive market. Let me break it down step by step.

The question says the firm is a price taker for both the goods it sells and the wages it pays. So, in a perfectly competitive market, the firm can't influence the price of the product or the wage rate. They take those as given.

Now, there's a technological innovation that significantly raises the firm's marginal physical product (MPP). Importantly, this doesn't affect other firms' MPP. So, this innovation makes the firm's workers more productive. 

I remember that in economics, MPP is the additional output a worker contributes. Since MPP is up, each worker is now producing more. But how does this affect the firm's hiring and wage decisions?

In a perfectly competitive market, the firm's wage is determined by the market, so they can't change it unilaterally. They are a price taker for wages, so the wage rate is fixed. 

Wait, but the question is about the firm's response. So, the firm's marginal revenue product (MRP) is what determines the optimal number of workers to hire. MRP is the marginal physical product multiplied by the price of the output. Since the firm can't change the price, if MPP increases, MRP increases as well.

In the short run, the firm will adjust the number of workers to maximize profit. The firm will hire workers until MRP equals the wage rate (MRP = W). With higher MRP, the firm will find that at the same wage, they can hire more workers because each additional worker brings in more revenue. So, they'll hire more workers.

But wait, the wage rate is fixed because they're price takers. So, the firm can't change the wage. So they just hire more workers because each worker is now more productive and brings in more revenue. So the firm's employment level increases.

Now, what about the wages? Since the firm is a price taker, they can't unilaterally change the wage. So even though each worker is more productive, the firm doesn't have the power to raise their wages. The wage rate is set by the market, so the firm continues to pay the same wage as before.

So looking at the options:

Option B says the firm hires more workers but doesn't raise their wages. That makes sense because MPP up leads to higher MRP, so more hiring, but wages stay the same.

Option E suggests raising wages, but since the firm is a price taker, they can't change the wage. So E is incorrect.

Option D says hire more and pay higher wages, but that's not possible because wages are set by the market.

So the correct answer should be B: lead the firm to hire more workers but not to raise their wages.

The firm is a price taker in both goods and labor markets. A technological innovation increases its marginal physical product (MPP), raising the marginal revenue product (MRP) since MRP = MPP × price. With higher MRP, the firm will hire more workers until MRP equals the fixed wage rate. Wages remain unchanged as the firm cannot set them. 

Answer: B
