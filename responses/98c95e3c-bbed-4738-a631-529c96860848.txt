Alright, so I need to figure out which of these options is not an available tool for assessing suicide risk. Let's go through each option one by one.

Starting with option A: Suicide Risk Identification Tool. I've heard of this before, it's used to identify individuals at risk, so that's a valid tool.

Option B: Suicide Risk Assessment Manual. Manuals are standard resources, so this is likely a real tool used by professionals.

Option C: Mood Disorder Questionnaire. I'm not as sure about this one. I know there are questionnaires for mood disorders, but I'm not certain if this is specifically a tool for assessing suicide risk. It might be more about diagnosing mood disorders in general.

Option D: Beck Hopelessness Scale. Yes, Beck's scales are well-known. The Hopelessness Scale is definitely used to assess suicidal risk because hopelessness is a big factor.

Option E: Beck Scale for Suicidal Ideation. Definitely a real tool. Beck created several scales related to suicide, so this is valid.

Option F: The Suicide Action Questionnaire. I think I've heard of this one; it's used to assess how likely someone is to act on suicidal thoughts, so that's a real tool.

Option G: Oxford Happiness Questionnaire. Hmm, this one rings a bell. I think the Oxford Happiness Questionnaire is more about measuring happiness and well-being rather than assessing suicide risk. It's used to determine how happy someone is, which is the opposite of what we're looking for here.

Option H: Suicidal Ideation Questionnaire. This sounds familiar. I believe there's a SIQ (Suicidal Ideation Questionnaire) that's used to assess the presence and severity of suicidal thoughts.

Option I: Depression Anxiety Stress Scales. DASS is a widely used tool to measure levels of depression, anxiety, and stress. While these are related to suicide risk, the DASS itself isn't specifically a suicide risk assessment tool but rather a general mood and stress measure.

Option J: Mental Health Inventory. I'm not too sure about this one. There are various mental health inventories, like the General Health Questionnaire, but I'm not certain if this is specifically used for suicide risk assessment. It might be a more general mental health assessment.

Now, thinking about each option, the key is to find the one that's not used for assessing suicide risk. 

Options A, B, D, E, F, H are all directly related to suicide risk assessment. C is for mood disorders in general, which might not directly assess suicide risk. G is about happiness, which is the opposite of what's needed. J could be a general mental health tool, but I'm not certain if it's specifically for suicide risk. 

Wait, the question is about which is NOT available for assessing suicide risk. So, the Oxford Happiness Questionnaire (G) is definitely not used for that. It measures happiness, which is a protective factor, not a risk factor. So G is the correct answer.

The correct answer is G: Oxford Happiness Questionnaire, as it is not used for assessing suicide risk.

Answer: G
