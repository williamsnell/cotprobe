Okay, so I've got this physics question here, and I need to figure out which of the given quantities decreases as the inverse square of distance for distances far from the objects producing the fields. The options are A through G, each describing a different field scenario. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I remember that fields like electric and magnetic fields have different behaviors depending on the source and the distance from it. The question specifically asks about inverse square law behavior, which I know applies to certain fields at a distance.

Inverse square law means that the field strength is proportional to 1 over the square of the distance from the source. So, the quantity should decrease with 1/r² as you move away. I also recall that some fields fall off more slowly, like 1/r, or even stay constant, depending on the setup.

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: Magnetic field from an infinitely long, straight current-carrying wire. I think the formula for the magnetic field around a long straight wire is B = (μ0 I)/(2π r), where r is the distance from the wire. So B is proportional to 1/r, which means it decreases as the inverse of distance, not inverse square. So A doesn't fit the question.

Option B: Magnetic field from a finite-length current-carrying wire. Hmm, a finite-length wire would have a different field pattern. For a long distance compared to the length of the wire, I think the field might resemble that of a dipole. The magnetic dipole field falls off as 1/r². So B could be a candidate, but I'm not sure if it's exactly the same as the dipole case.

Option C: Magnetic field from a current loop. A single loop can be considered a magnetic dipole. The field on the axis of the loop at a distance r much larger than the radius R of the loop behaves like B = (μ0 I)/(2r³) * (something like that?), wait, no, wait. Wait, I think the magnetic dipole field falls off as 1/r³. Because the dipole field is proportional to (1/r³) for r much larger than the dipole size. So that's even steeper than inverse square. So C's field decreases faster than 1/r², so it's not the answer.

Option D: Electric field from a finite-length charged rod. A finite rod is a charge distribution. For points far away (r >> length), the electric field would resemble that of a point charge. The electric field of a point charge is E = kQ/r², so it does follow the inverse square law. So D could be a candidate. But wait, the question is about which quantity decreases as inverse square. So D might be correct. But let me check all options.

Option E: Magnetic field from a uniformly magnetized infinite plane. Hmm, an infinite plane with uniform magnetization. I'm not entirely sure about this. I remember that the magnetic field due to an infinite sheet of magnetization can be found using Ampère's Law. Alternatively, maybe it's similar to a surface current. Let me think: for an infinite plane with surface current K, the magnetic field inside is zero, and outside, it's B = (μ0 K)/(2) perpendicular to the plane. Wait, but K is constant, so B would be constant with distance. So E's field doesn't decrease with distance; it's uniform. So E isn't the answer.

Option F: Electric field from an infinite plane of charge. The electric field from an infinite plane of charge is σ/(2ε0), which is constant with distance. So it doesn't follow inverse square; it's the same everywhere. So F isn't correct.

Option G: Electric field from an infinitely long charged cylinder. If the cylinder is charged along its length, say with charge per unit length λ, then using Gauss's Law, the electric field at radius r > R (where R is cylinder radius) would be E = λ/(2πε0 r). So that's proportional to 1/r, not 1/r². So G's field decreases as inverse distance, not inverse square.

Now, let's recap. The question asks which quantity decreases as inverse square. From the options:

- A: 1/r (magnetic field, long wire) → no.
- B: finite wire → dipole-like, which is 1/r²? Wait, wait. Wait, magnetic dipole field is 1/r³. Hmm, so B would be 1/r²? Or not? Let me clarify.

Wait, when you have a finite-length wire, the field at a point far from the wire can be approximated as a dipole. The magnetic dipole field at large r is given by B ≈ (μ0 m)/(4π r³) * (some direction factors), so it's proportional to 1/r³. So B would actually decrease as 1/r³, which is faster than inverse square. So B isn't the answer either.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the field from a dipole is 1/r³. So maybe I made a mistake with option B.

Wait, but wait, what about the finite-length wire's field? For a finite-length wire, when you're very far away, the field should approximate that of a dipole. So the field would fall off as 1/r³, which is steeper than 1/r². So B's field doesn't follow inverse square.

So let's reevaluate. The options that do follow inverse square would be D and possibly others.

Wait, D is the electric field from a finite-length charged rod. As I thought earlier, for points far away, the field approximates that of a point charge, so E ∝ 1/r². So D is a candidate.

Wait, but are there any other options where the field falls as 1/r²?

Looking back, option A is 1/r, B is 1/r³, C is 1/r³, D is 1/r², E is constant, F is constant, G is 1/r.

So the only option that shows inverse square dependence is D. So the correct answer should be D.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me think again. What about the electric field from a finite-length rod? When the point is at a distance much larger than the length of the rod, the field would be similar to that of a point charge, so yes, E ∝ 1/r².

So the answer should be D.

The question asks which quantity decreases as the inverse square of distance for large distances from the source. To determine this, we analyze each option:

- **A**: The magnetic field from an infinitely long, straight current-carrying wire decreases as \( \frac{1}{r} \), not \( \frac{1}{r^2} \).
- **B**: The magnetic field from a finite-length current-carrying wire approximates a dipole field at large distances, which decreases as \( \frac{1}{r^3} \), faster than \( \frac{1}{r^2} \).
- **C**: The magnetic field from a current loop also approximates a dipole field at large distances, decreasing as \( \frac{1}{r^3} \).
- **D**: The electric field from a finite-length charged rod, at distances much larger than the rod's length, approximates the field of a point charge, which decreases as \( \frac{1}{r^2} \).
- **E**: The magnetic field from a uniformly magnetized infinite plane is constant and does not decrease with distance.
- **F**: The electric field from an infinite plane of charge is constant and does not decrease with distance.
- **G**: The electric field from an infinitely long charged cylinder decreases as \( \frac{1}{r} \), not \( \frac{1}{r^2} \).

The only quantity that decreases as the inverse square of distance is the electric field from a finite-length charged rod in option **D**.
