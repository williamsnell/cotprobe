Okay, so I've got this heat transfer problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand it.

The question is about laminar film condensation of super-saturated steam on a vertical surface. The steam is at 1.43 psi and has a saturation temperature of 114°F. The wall temperature is 105°F. I need to find the coefficient of heat transfer at a point 3 inches from the top. The options are A to D, with the answers given in Btu/hr-ft²-°F.

Hmm, from what I remember, condensation heat transfer involves the transfer of heat from a surface to a fluid that is condensing on it. Since it's laminar flow, I think the Nusselt number might come into play here. Also, the surface is vertical, so maybe the geometry affects the calculation.

Wait, but the question mentions the point is 3 inches from the top. I'm not entirely sure how the position affects the heat transfer coefficient. Maybe it's about the length of the surface from that point to the top? Or perhaps it's about the height in terms of the flow characteristics.

Let me recall the formula for the convective heat transfer coefficient in laminar film condensation. I think the formula is something like h = (2.409 * (k^2) / (mu * L_v))^(1/3) * (g * (delta_p)^3 / (mu^2 * rho))^(1/3), but I might be mixing things up. Alternatively, I remember that for vertical surfaces, the formula might be different than for horizontal ones.

Wait, no, maybe it's simpler. I think the general formula for the Nusselt number in laminar flow is Nu = (2.409 * (Pr/ (1 + 12.7 Pr^(2/3)))^0.437 * (Re)^(-0.135)), but that's for forced convection. For condensation, perhaps it's different.

Alternatively, I remember that for laminar film condensation on a vertical plate, the heat transfer coefficient can be calculated using the formula h = (k * (g * (T_sat - T_wall) * L_v)^0.5) ) where k is the thermal conductivity of the vapor, g is gravity, T_sat is saturation temperature, T_wall is wall temperature, and L_v is the latent heat of vaporization.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The formula I remember is h = ( (2 * k * (g * (T_s - T_w) * L_v )^(1/2) ) / (mu) )^(1/3) ) ? I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should look up the standard formula for vertical surface condensation.

Alternatively, I think the formula is h = ( (k^2 * g * (T_s - T_w) * L_v ) / (mu) )^(1/3), but I'm not entirely sure. Wait, perhaps it's better to approach this systematically.

Given that the condensation is laminar and on a vertical surface, the heat transfer coefficient can be found using the formula derived from the Nusselt number for laminar flow. I think the formula is h = (k * (g * (T_sat - T_wall) * L_v) )^(1/2) ) / (mu), but I'm not confident.

Wait, another approach: I remember that for vertical surfaces, the formula for the condensation coefficient is given by:

h = ( (k * (g * (T_sat - T_wall) * L_v) )^(1/2) ) ) / (mu) * ( ( (T_sat - T_wall) ) / (T_sat) )^0.5 )

Wait, I'm getting more confused. Maybe I should think about the known values and see what I can find.

Given:
- Pressure = 1.43 psi
- Saturation temperature, T_sat = 114°F
- Wall temperature, T_wall = 105°F
- The point is 3 inches from the top, which is 0.25 feet (since 3 inches = 0.25 ft).

Wait, but why does the position matter? Maybe it affects the length over which condensation occurs, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's about the height of the surface, but the formula might not require it. Hmm.

I think I need to find the properties of the steam at the given pressure. Let me see, for steam at 1.43 psi, which is slightly above atmospheric pressure. The saturation temperature is given as 114°F, so that's consistent with the steam tables.

I should look up the properties of steam at 1.43 psi (which is about 114°F). From the steam tables, I can find the latent heat of vaporization (L_v), thermal conductivity (k), viscosity (mu), and density (rho) at the saturation temperature.

Looking up the steam tables:

At 114°F (which is about 45.6°C), the properties are:

- Latent heat of vaporization, L_v ≈ 970.3 Btu/lb (this might vary slightly, but I'll use this value)
- Thermal conductivity, k ≈ 0.269 Btu/hr-ft²-°F
- Viscosity, mu ≈ 0.01865 lb/hr-ft²
- Density, rho ≈ 0.01935 slug/hr²-ft

Wait, let me verify these values because I might be mixing up units. Alternatively, perhaps I should use consistent units throughout.

Wait, the formula I'm thinking of uses the following approach:

For laminar film condensation on a vertical surface, the heat transfer coefficient (h) can be calculated using:

h = ( (2 * k^3 * g * (T_sat - T_wall) * L_v ) / (mu^2 * rho) )^(1/4)

Wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, I think the formula is:

h = ( (k^2 * g * (T_s - T_w) * L_v ) / (mu) )^(1/3)

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula for vertical surfaces. Let me see, I think the correct formula is:

h = ( (k * (g * (T_s - T_w) * L_v )^(1/2) ) ) / (mu) )^(1/1)

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Another approach: I remember that for fully developed laminar flow on a vertical surface, the Nusselt number (Nu) is given by:

Nu = ( (k * (g * (T_s - T_w) * L_v )^(1/2) ) ) / (mu) )

But wait, that can't be right because the units might not balance. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula:

h = ( (k * (g * (T_s - T_w) * L_v ) )^(1/2) ) / (mu) )

Wait, but I'm not certain. Let me try to get the formula correct. I think the correct formula for h in the case of vertical surface condensation is:

h = ( (k^2 * g * (T_s - T_w) * L_v ) / (mu) )^(1/3)

Yes, that seems familiar. So, h = [ (k^2 * g * (T_s - T_w) * L_v ) / mu ]^(1/3)

Now, let's plug in the numbers. First, let's calculate each part.

Given:
- T_s = 114°F
- T_w = 105°F
- So, (T_s - T_w) = 9°F. I might need to convert this to Rankine for temperature differences, but I'm not sure if it's necessary here since the units might cancel out.

Wait, no, in the formula, (T_s - T_w) is a temperature difference, but since we're dealing with a product, perhaps it's better to keep it in Fahrenheit as long as all other terms are in consistent units.

Let me list the properties again (assuming they're correct):

- k = 0.269 Btu/hr-ft²-°F
- mu = 0.01865 lb/hr-ft²
- L_v = 970.3 Btu/lb
- g = 32.174 ft/s²

Wait, I think I might have made a mistake. The latent heat of vaporization (L_v) is 970 Btu/lb, that's correct. Viscosity (mu) is in lb/hr-ft², correct. Thermal conductivity (k) is in Btu/hr-ft²-°F, correct. Gravity (g) is 32.174 ft/s².

So, plugging into the formula:

h = [ (k^2 * g * (T_s - T_w) * L_v ) / mu ]^(1/3)

Let me compute each term step by step.

First, k^2 = (0.269)^2 ≈ 0.072361 (Btu^2/hr²-ft^4-°F²)

g = 32.174 ft/s²

(T_s - T_w) = 9°F

L_v = 970.3 Btu/lb

mu = 0.01865 lb/hr-ft²

Now, multiply all these together:

Numerator = k^2 * g * (T_s - T_w) * L_v
= 0.072361 * 32.174 * 9 * 970.3

Let me compute this step by step.

First, 0.072361 * 32.174 ≈ 2.327 (approx)

Then, 2.327 * 9 ≈ 20.943

Then, 20.943 * 970.3 ≈ 20,327.6 (approx)

So numerator ≈ 20,327.6 (units: (Btu^2/hr²-ft^4-°F²) * ft/s² * °F * Btu/lb )

Wait, perhaps I should check the units to make sure everything is compatible. But perhaps it's getting too complicated. Let me proceed.

Denominator = mu = 0.01865 lb/hr-ft²

So, the fraction inside the cube root is:

20,327.6 / 0.01865 ≈ 1,090,000 (approx)

Wait, 20,327.6 divided by 0.01865 is about 20,327.6 / 0.01865 ≈ 1,090,000.

Now, take the cube root of that: (1,090,000)^(1/3) ≈ ?

I know that 100^3 = 1,000,000, so the cube root of 1,090,000 is approximately 103, because 103^3 ≈ 1,092,727. So, approximately 103.

But wait, that seems too low. The options are over 1000. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the units somewhere. Let me check each step again.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate each multiplication more accurately.

Let me compute the numerator step by step.

k^2 = (0.269)^2 = 0.072361 Btu²/(hr²-ft^4-°F²)

g = 32.174 ft/s²

(T_s - T_w) = 9°F

L_v = 970.3 Btu/lb

So, numerator = 0.072361 * 32.174 * 9 * 970.3

First, 0.072361 * 32.174 ≈ 0.072361 * 32 = 2.31555, and 0.072361 * 0.174 ≈ 0.01255, so total ≈ 2.31555 + 0.01255 ≈ 2.3281.

Next, 2.3281 * 9 ≈ 20.9529.

Then, 20.9529 * 970.3 ≈ Let's compute 20 * 970.3 = 19,406; 0.9529 * 970.3 ≈ 924. So total ≈ 19,406 + 924 ≈ 20,330.

So numerator ≈ 20,330.

Denominator = mu = 0.01865 lb/hr-ft²

So, 20,330 / 0.01865 ≈ Let's compute this.

20,330 divided by 0.01865.

0.01865 is approximately 1/53.6, so 20,330 * 53.6 ≈ 20,330 * 50 = 1,016,500; 20,330 * 3.6 ≈ 73,188. So total ≈ 1,016,500 + 73,188 ≈ 1,089,688.

So the fraction is approximately 1,089,688.

Now, take the cube root of 1,089,688.

Cube of 100 is 1,000,000. 102^3 = 1,061,208; 103^3 = 1,092,727. So, 1,089,688 is between 102^3 and 103^3.

Approximately, 103^3 is 1,092,727, so cube root of 1,089,688 is about 102.97.

So h ≈ 103 Btu/hr-ft²-°F.

Wait, but looking at the options, the answers are all in the thousands except option D, which is 0.3656. So this suggests I've made a mistake in the calculation.

Hmm. I must have messed up somewhere. Let me go back.

Wait a second, perhaps I used the wrong formula. Maybe the formula is different for vertical surfaces. Alternatively, perhaps I forgot to consider the length from the top.

Wait, the problem states it's 3 inches from the top, which is 0.25 ft. Maybe the formula involves the length of the surface, but in the formula I used, I didn't consider any length term. That might be the issue.

Wait, perhaps the formula includes the length (L) of the surface. Let me think again. Maybe the formula is:

h = ( (k^2 * g * (T_s - T_w) * L_v * L) / mu )^(1/3)

Wait, but I didn't include L in my calculation earlier. If L is 0.25 ft, that would significantly affect the result.

So, let's adjust the formula to include L. Then, h = [ (k^2 * g * (T_s - T_w) * L_v * L) / mu ]^(1/3)

Now, L = 0.25 ft.

So, numerator becomes 20,330 * 0.25 = 5,082.5

Denominator is 0.01865

So, 5,082.5 / 0.01865 ≈ 5,082.5 / 0.01865 ≈ let's compute 5,082.5 / 0.01865:

0.01865 is approximately 1/53.6. So 5,082.5 * 53.6 ≈ 5,082.5 * 50 = 254,125; 5,082.5 * 3.6 ≈ 18,297. So total ≈ 254,125 + 18,297 ≈ 272,422.

Now, take the cube root of 272,422.

Cube of 65 is 274,625. So cube root of 272,422 is approximately 64.8, let's say 65.

So h ≈ 65 Btu/hr-ft²-°F.

But looking at the options, the smallest is 0.3656, so 65 is not matching any option. Hmm, perhaps I made another mistake.

Wait, maybe I forgot to account for the fact that the formula uses the length in a different way. Alternatively, perhaps the formula doesn't include L, but I'm supposed to use the length in some other way.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for vertical plates, which I think is:

h = (k * (g * (T_s - T_w) * L_v )^(1/2) ) / (mu) ) * ( (L) )^(1/2)

Wait, maybe. Let me try that.

So, h = [k * sqrt(g * (T_s - T_w) * L_v) ] / mu ) * sqrt(L)

So, let's compute each part.

Compute sqrt(g*(T_s - T_w)*L_v):

g = 32.174 ft/s²

(T_s - T_w) = 9°F

L_v = 970.3 Btu/lb

So, g*(T_s - T_w)*L_v = 32.174 * 9 * 970.3

32.174 *9 = 289.566

289.566 * 970.3 ≈ 289,566 * 970.3 ≈ Let's compute that.

Well, 289.566 * 1000 = 289,566, so 289,566 * 970.3 ≈ 289,566 * 970 ≈ 289,566 * 900 = 260,609,400; 289,566 * 70 = 20,269,620; total ≈ 260,609,400 + 20,269,620 ≈ 280,879,020.

Wait, but that's way too high. Wait, no, actually, I think I made a mistake here. Let me compute 32.174 *9 = 289.566, then 289.566 *970.3.

Wait, perhaps better to compute 289.566 * 970.3:

First, 289.566 * 900 = 260,609.4

289.566 * 70 = 20,269.62

289.566 * 0.3 = 86.8698

Adding them up: 260,609.4 + 20,269.62 = 280,879.02; +86.8698 ≈ 280,965.89.

So, sqrt(280,965.89) ≈ 530.06 (since 530^2 = 280,900, which is close).

Now, k = 0.269 Btu/hr-ft²-°F

mu = 0.01865 lb/hr-ft²

So, [k * sqrt(g*(T_s - T_w)*L_v) ] / mu = (0.269 * 530.06) / 0.01865

Compute numerator: 0.269 * 530.06 ≈ 142.68

Denominator: 0.01865

So, 142.68 / 0.01865 ≈ 7,645.5

Now, multiply by sqrt(L) where L=0.25 ft.

sqrt(0.25) = 0.5

So, h = 7,645.5 * 0.5 ≈ 3,822.75 Btu/hr-ft²-°F

That's approximately 3,823, which isn't matching any of the options either. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the formula is different. Perhaps I should refer to the standard formula for vertical plate condensation, which I think is:

h = ( (k^3 * g * (T_s - T_w) * L_v ) / (mu^2 * rho) )^(1/4)

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula from Incropera's Fundamentals of Heat and Mass Transfer.

Wait, from what I remember, for vertical surfaces, the formula for h is:

h = ( (k^2 * g * (T_s - T_w) * L_v ) / (mu) )^(1/3)

But I think I included L in the formula earlier, but perhaps it's not needed. Alternatively, maybe the position from the top doesn't affect h, which seems counterintuitive.

Wait, perhaps the position from the top affects the length of the surface, but in the formula, L is the length over which condensation occurs. So, if the point is 3 inches from the top, perhaps the length from that point to the bottom is not given, so maybe we assume L is the total height of the surface. Hmm, but the problem doesn't specify the total height, so perhaps L isn't a factor here.

Alternatively, maybe for vertical surfaces, the position from the top doesn't affect the local heat transfer coefficient, which would be surprising. But perhaps the formula gives a constant h independent of position, which I'm not sure about.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula without considering L, as I did earlier, which gave me h ≈ 103. But that doesn't match any options, so perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, maybe I should use the formula for horizontal surfaces, but that's a different case.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the correct formula is h = (k * (g * (T_s - T_w) * L_v )^(1/2) ) / (mu) )

So, let's compute that.

Compute sqrt(g*(T_s - T_w)*L_v) = sqrt(32.174 *9 *970.3) ≈ sqrt(280,965.89) ≈ 530.06 as before.

Then, h = (0.269 * 530.06) / 0.01865 ≈ (142.68) / 0.01865 ≈ 7,645.5 Btu/hr-ft²-°F.

Wait, that's about 7,645, which is not matching any option either.

Hmm, perhaps I'm using the wrong properties. Let me double-check the steam properties at 114°F.

Looking up steam tables at 114°F (which is 40.6°C), the properties are approximately:

- Latent heat of vaporization (L_v) ≈ 970 Btu/lb
- Thermal conductivity (k) ≈ 0.268 Btu/hr-ft²-°F
- Viscosity (mu) ≈ 0.01865 lb/hr-ft²
- Density (rho) ≈ 0.01935 slug/hr²-ft

Wait, maybe I should use the density in the formula. Let me think again.

Another approach: The formula for the Nusselt number in laminar condensation on a vertical plate is Nu = ( (k * (g * (T_s - T_w) * L_v )^(1/2) ) ) / (mu) )

But wait, that can't be right because the units would be in 1/time, which doesn't match.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

h = ( (k^2 * g * (T_s - T_w) * L_v ) / (mu) )^(1/3)

Which is what I tried earlier, but that gave me h ≈ 103, which doesn't match any option.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in calculation. Let me try that formula again without including L.

So, h = [ (k^2 * g * (T_s - T_w) * L_v ) / mu ]^(1/3)

Plugging in the numbers:

k = 0.269 Btu/hr-ft²-°F

k² = 0.269² = 0.072361

g = 32.174 ft/s²

(T_s - T_w) = 9°F

L_v = 970.3 Btu/lb

mu = 0.01865 lb/hr-ft²

So, numerator = 0.072361 * 32.174 * 9 * 970.3

As before, that's 0.072361 *32.174 ≈ 2.3281, then *9 ≈20.9529, then *970.3 ≈ 20,330.

Denominator = 0.01865

So, 20,330 / 0.01865 ≈ 1,089,688

Cube root of 1,089,688 ≈ 103.

Hmm, but options don't have 103. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula uses the density (rho) as well. Let me check another formula.

I found a reference that says for vertical plate condensation, the formula is:

h = ( (k * (g * (T_s - T_w) * L_v )^(1/2) ) ) / (mu) ) * ( (rho * mu^2 ) / (g * (T_s - T_w) * L_v) )^(1/4)

Wait, that seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

h = ( (k^2 * g * (T_s - T_w) * L_v ) / (mu * rho) )^(1/3)

Wait, let me try that.

So, h = [ (k^2 * g * (T_s - T_w) * L_v ) / (mu * rho) ]^(1/3)

Plugging in the numbers:

k² = 0.072361

g =32.174

(T_s - T_w) =9

L_v =970.3

mu=0.01865

rho=0.01935 slug/hr²-ft

So numerator = 0.072361 *32.174 *9 *970.3 ≈20,330 as before.

Denominator = mu * rho = 0.01865 *0.01935 ≈0.00036

So, 20,330 / 0.00036 ≈56,472,222.22

Now, cube root of 56,472,222 ≈383.2 Btu/hr-ft²-°F

That's about 383, which is close to option C (1,567) but not exactly. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula without rho, as I did earlier, but that gave me 103, which doesn't match.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula is:

h = ( (k^3 * g * (T_s - T_w) * L_v ) / (mu^2 * rho) )^(1/4)

Let me compute that.

k^3 = (0.269)^3 ≈0.0193

g=32.174

(T_s - T_w)=9

L_v=970.3

mu=0.01865

rho=0.01935

So, numerator =0.0193 *32.174 *9 *970.3

0.0193 *32.174 ≈0.621

0.621 *9=5.589

5.589 *970.3≈5,427.4

Denominator = mu² * rho = (0.01865)^2 *0.01935 ≈ (0.000348) *0.01935≈0.00000675

So, 5,427.4 / 0.00000675 ≈ 804,060,000

Now, take the fourth root: (804,060,000)^(1/4)

The fourth root of 100,000,000 is 17.78, so 804 million is about 8 times that, so cube root of 8 is 2, so 17.78 * 2 =35.56, but that's not matching.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should approach this differently.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula for vertical plate condensation which is:

h = ( (k * (g * (T_s - T_w) * L_v )^(1/2) ) ) / (mu) ) * ( (T_s) / (T_s - T_w) )^(1/4)

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

h = ( (k * (g * (T_s - T_w) * L_v )^(1/2) ) ) / (mu) )

Which would give h = (0.269 * sqrt(32.174*9*970.3)) / 0.01865

We computed sqrt(280,965.89)=530.06

So, h= (0.269 *530.06)/0.01865 ≈ (142.68)/0.01865≈7,645.5 Btu/hr-ft²-°F

But that's not an option either. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me look for a standard formula.

Upon checking, the formula for the convective heat transfer coefficient for laminar film condensation on a vertical plate is given by:

h = ( (k^2 * g * (T_s - T_w) * L_v ) / (mu) )^(1/3)

Which is what I used earlier, giving h≈103 Btu/hr-ft²-°F.

But none of the options match that. The options are A:1486, B:1071.6, C:1567, D:0.3656.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the formula uses (T_s + T_w) instead of (T_s - T_w). Let me try that.

(T_s + T_w) = 114 + 105 = 219°F

So, let's recalculate with 219.

h = [ (k^2 * g * (T_s + T_w) * L_v ) / mu ]^(1/3)

So, numerator = 0.072361 *32.174 *219 *970.3

Compute step by step.

0.072361 *32.174 ≈2.3281

2.3281 *219 ≈511.38

511.38 *970.3 ≈511,380 *970.3 ≈ let's compute 511.38 *970.3 ≈511,380 *970.3.

Wait, that's a big number. Let me compute 511.38 *970 ≈511,380 *970.3 ≈ 511.38 *970 ≈ 496,038.6.

So numerator ≈496,038.6

Divide by mu=0.01865: 496,038.6 /0.01865 ≈26,599,000

Cube root of 26,599,000 ≈299. So h≈299.

Still not matching any options. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the formula uses the absolute temperature. Let me check.

Alternatively, perhaps I should convert temperatures to Rankine.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the formula uses the average temperature or something else. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the properties at the wall temperature instead of the saturation temperature.

Wait, that could be a mistake. I assumed all properties are at T_sat, but perhaps they should be evaluated at the average temperature between T_sat and T_wall.

The average temperature, T_avg = (114 + 105)/2 = 109.5°F.

So, let me look up the properties at 109.5°F.

But without exact tables, I'll make an approximation. Let's assume that the properties change slightly, but perhaps the effect isn't drastic. Alternatively, maybe I should proceed without adjusting, as this might complicate things further.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the formula uses the length from the point to the top, which is 3 inches or 0.25 ft. So, perhaps the formula includes L as 0.25 ft.

Wait, I think I tried including L earlier, but perhaps I should try again.

Using the formula:

h = [ (k^2 * g * (T_s - T_w) * L_v * L ) / mu ]^(1/3)

With L=0.25 ft.

So, numerator =0.072361 *32.174 *9 *970.3 *0.25 ≈20,330 *0.25≈5,082.5

Denominator=0.01865

So, 5,082.5 /0.01865≈272,422

Cube root of 272,422≈65 Btu/hr-ft²-°F.

Still not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the formula is different for vertical surfaces. I found a reference that says for vertical surfaces, the formula is:

h = ( (k * (g * (T_s - T_w) * L_v )^(1/2) ) ) / (mu) ) * ( (T_s) / (T_s - T_w) )^(1/4)

Let me compute that.

Compute sqrt(g*(T_s - T_w)*L_v) = sqrt(32.174*9*970.3)=sqrt(280,965.89)=530.06

So, (k * 530.06)/mu = (0.269 *530.06)/0.01865 ≈142.68/0.01865≈7,645.5

Now, multiply by (T_s/(T_s - T_w))^(1/4) = (114/9)^(1/4)=12.6667^(0.25)

12.6667^(0.25) is the fourth root of 12.6667. Let's compute that.

The fourth root of 16 is 2, so 12.6667 is a bit less than that. Let's approximate it as 1.91.

So, h=7,645.5 *1.91≈14,631 Btu/hr-ft²-°F.

Still not matching any option. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should try using the formula without any modifications and see if any option aligns.

Earlier, without including L, h≈103. Without any other option close, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to use the formula for horizontal surfaces, but that's unlikely.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula for film condensation on a vertical plate is:

h = ( (k * (g * (T_s - T_w) * L_v )^(1/2) ) ) / (mu) ) * ( (L) )^(1/2)

So, including L as 0.25 ft.

So, h = (0.269 *530.06)/0.01865 * sqrt(0.25) ≈7,645.5 *0.5≈3,822.75 Btu/hr-ft²-°F.

Still not matching.

Wait, maybe the formula is h = (k * (g * (T_s - T_w) * L_v )^(1/2)) / (mu) )^(1/2)

So, h= sqrt( (0.269 *530.06)/0.01865 ) ≈ sqrt(7,645.5)≈87.44.

Still not matching.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Let me try to look for another approach. Maybe I should use the natural convection formula.

Wait, natural convection for condensation might involve the same approach as forced convection but with different factors.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

h = ( (k * (g * (T_s - T_w) * L_v )^(1/2) ) ) / (mu) ) * ( (Pr) )^(1/3)

Where Pr is the Prandtl number.

Wait, Pr = mu/(k * rho) = 0.01865 / (0.269 *0.01935) ≈0.01865/(0.00522)≈3.573.

So, h=7,645.5 * (3.573)^(1/3) ≈7,645.5 *1.53≈11,700.

Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the formula uses the position from the top, which affects the velocity profile, but I don't know how.

Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the Dittus-Boelter equation, which is used for tube flow. But since it's a vertical plate, that might not apply.

Another thought: perhaps the position from the top affects the length of the surface, but without knowing the total length, I can't compute it. So maybe the position isn't relevant, and the formula gives a constant h regardless of position, which seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

h = ( (k^2 * g * (T_s - T_w) * L_v ) / (mu) )^(1/3)

Which gives h≈103.

But since the options don't have that, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses (T_s + T_w) instead of (T_s - T_w), but I tried that earlier and it didn't help.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the latent heat is in different units. Let me check: 970 Btu/lb is correct.

Wait, maybe I should use the formula for vertical surfaces and include the effect of the point's position. I think the formula for vertical surfaces is:

h = ( (k^2 * g * (T_s - T_w) * L_v * x ) / mu )^(1/3)

Where x is the distance from the top. So, x=0.25 ft.

So, let's compute that.

h = [ (k^2 * g * (T_s - T_w) * L_v * x ) / mu ]^(1/3)

Plugging in the numbers:

k²=0.072361

g=32.174

(T_s - T_w)=9

L_v=970.3

x=0.25

mu=0.01865

Numerator=0.072361 *32.174 *9 *970.3 *0.25

Compute step by step:

0.072361 *32.174≈2.3281

2.3281 *9≈20.9529

20.9529 *970.3≈20,330

20,330 *0.25≈5,082.5

Denominator=0.01865

So, 5,082.5 /0.01865≈272,422

Cube root of 272,422≈65.

Hmm, that's still not matching any option.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the formula uses the distance from the top as the length, but in the denominator. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

h = ( (k^2 * g * (T_s - T_w) * L_v ) / (mu * x) )^(1/3)

Which would give:

x=0.25 ft.

So, numerator=20,330

Denominator=0.01865 *0.25≈0.0046625

20,330 /0.0046625≈4,356,000

Cube root≈163.

Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the formula uses x in the denominator, but that would give a much higher h.

Alternatively, maybe I should give up and look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps I should refer to the formula from my notes. I think the correct formula for vertical surfaces is:

h = ( (k^2 * g * (T_s - T_w) * L_v ) / (mu) )^(1/3)

Which gives me h≈103.

But since none of the options match, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check once more.

Compute numerator:

k²=0.269²=0.072361

g=32.174

ΔT=9

L_v=970.3

So, 0.072361 *32.174=2.3281

2.3281 *9=20.9529

20.9529 *970.3=20,330

mu=0.01865

20,330 /0.01865≈1,089,688

Cube root≈103.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is 103, but it's not listed. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula is:

h = ( (k * (g * (T_s - T_w) * L_v )^(1/2) ) ) / (mu) )^(1/2)

So, h = sqrt( (0.269 *530.06)/0.01865 ) ≈ sqrt(7,645.5)≈87.44.

Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

h = ( (k * (g * (T_s - T_w) * L_v )^(1/2) ) ) / (mu) ) * ( (rho) )^(1/3)

rho=0.01935 slug/hr²-ft

So, h=7,645.5 * (0.01935)^(1/3)

(0.01935)^(1/3)=cube root of 0.01935≈0.268

So, h≈7,645.5 *0.268≈2,048.

Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the formula is:

h = ( (k^2 * g * (T_s - T_w) * L_v ) / (mu) )^(1/3) * ( (x) )^(1/3)

Where x=0.25 ft.

So, h=103 * (0.25)^(1/3)=103 *0.63≈65.

Still not matching.

Hmm, I'm stuck. None of the options match my calculations, so perhaps I made a mistake in the formula or in the properties.

Wait, perhaps I should check the latent heat of vaporization again. At 114°F, L_v is about 970 Btu/lb, correct.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula uses the absolute temperature in Rankine. Let me try that.

(T_s - T_w) in Rankine: 9°F=9+459.67=468.67 R

So, using 468.67 instead of 9.

Compute h = [ (k^2 * g * (T_s - T_w)_R * L_v ) / mu ]^(1/3)

k²=0.072361

g=32.174

(T_s - T_w)_R=468.67

L_v=970.3

mu=0.01865

So, numerator=0.072361 *32.174 *468.67 *970.3

Compute step by step:

0.072361 *32.174≈2.3281

2.3281 *468.67≈1,090. (approx)

1,090 *970.3≈1,057,617.

Denominator=0.01865

So, 1,057,617 /0.01865≈56,720,000

Cube root≈384.

Still not matching any option.

Wait, maybe the formula uses (T_s + T_w) in Rankine.

(T_s + T_w)=114+105=219°F=219+459.67=678.67 R

So, numerator=0.072361 *32.174 *678.67 *970.3

0.072361 *32.174≈2.3281

2.3281 *678.67≈1,579.

1,579 *970.3≈1,530,000.

Denominator=0.01865

1,530,000 /0.01865≈82,000,000.

Cube root≈434.

Still not matching.

Hmm, perhaps I should conclude that the correct answer is option B:1071.6, as it's the closest to my initial calculation of 103 when considering possible rounding errors or formula adjustments. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula and the correct answer is option B.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula is:

h = ( (k * (g * (T_s - T_w) * L_v )^(1/2) ) ) / (mu) ) * ( (T_s - T_w) )^(1/3)

Which would give h=7,645.5 * (9)^(1/3)=7,645.5 *2.08≈15,930.

No, that's not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the formula uses (T_s) instead of (T_s - T_w).

But that would give a much higher value.

I'm really stuck here. Since I can't get any of the options to match, perhaps I should look for another approach. Maybe the formula is different.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula for vertical surfaces which considers the position from the top, using the distance x.

I found a reference that says for vertical plates, the local heat transfer coefficient at a distance x from the top is given by:

h = ( (k^2 * g * (T_s - T_w) * L_v * x ) / (mu) )^(1/3)

So, with x=0.25 ft.

Plugging in:

k²=0.072361

g=32.174

ΔT=9

L_v=970.3

x=0.25

mu=0.01865

Numerator=0.072361*32.174*9*970.3*0.25=20,330*0.25=5,082.5

Denominator=0.01865

5,082.5/0.01865≈272,422

Cube root≈65.

Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the formula uses the distance from the top as the length, but in the denominator, which would give a much higher h.

But that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

h = ( (k^2 * g * (T_s - T_w) * L_v ) / (mu * x) )^(1/3)

So, x=0.25.

Numerator=20,330

Denominator=0.01865*0.25=0.0046625

20,330/0.0046625≈4,356,000

Cube root≈163.

Still not matching.

I think I'm stuck. Given the options, perhaps the correct answer is B:1071.6. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula, and the correct approach gives a higher value.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the formula is:

h = ( (k * (g * (T_s - T_w) * L_v )^(1/2) ) ) / (mu) ) * ( (x) )^(1/2)

With x=0.25.

So, h=7,645.5 * sqrt(0.25)=7,645.5 *0.5≈3,822.75.

Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

h = ( (k^2 * g * (T_s - T_w) * L_v ) / (mu) )^(1/3) * (x)^(1/3)

With x=0.25.

So, h=103 * (0.25)^(1/3)=103 *0.63≈65.

Still not matching.

I think I've exhausted all options and can't find a way to get any of the given answers. Perhaps the correct answer is B:1071.6, but I'm not sure how to arrive at it. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula, and the correct approach gives h≈1071.6.

The problem involves calculating the heat transfer coefficient for laminar film condensation on a vertical surface. The steam is at 1.43 psi with a saturation temperature of 114°F, and the wall temperature is 105°F. The position 3 inches (0.25 ft) from the top is also specified. The goal is to determine the coefficient of heat transfer using the given options.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Formula Selection**: The formula for the heat transfer coefficient in laminar film condensation on a vertical surface is:
   \[
   h = \left( \frac{k^2 \cdot g \cdot (T_s - T_w) \cdot L_v}{\mu} \right)^{1/3}
   \]
   where:
   - \(k\) = thermal conductivity,
   - \(g\) = acceleration due to gravity,
   - \(T_s\) = saturation temperature,
   - \(T_w\) = wall temperature,
   - \(L_v\) = latent heat of vaporization,
   - \(\mu\) = dynamic viscosity.

2. **Properties from Steam Tables**:
   - \(k = 0.269 \, \text{Btu/hr-ft}^2-\text{°F}\),
   - \(\mu = 0.01865 \, \text{lb/hr-ft}^2\),
   - \(L_v = 970.3 \, \text{Btu/lb}\),
   - \(g = 32.174 \, \text{ft/s}^2\),
   - \((T_s - T_w) = 9 \, \text{°F}\).

3. **Calculation**:
   - Compute \(k^2 = 0.269^2 = 0.072361\),
   - Multiply by \(g \cdot (T_s - T_w) \cdot L_v\):
     \[
     0.072361 \cdot 32.174 \cdot 9 \cdot 970.3 \approx 20,330
     \]
   - Divide by \(\mu\):
     \[
     \frac{20,330}{0.01865} \approx 1,089,688
     \]
   - Take the cube root:
     \[
     h \approx \sqrt[3]{1,089,688} \approx 103 \, \text{Btu/hr-ft}^2-\text{°F}.
     \]

4. **Position Consideration**: The position 3 inches from the top was considered, but no formula adjustments yielded a match with the given options. The calculated value of \(h \approx 103\) does not align with any option, suggesting either a discrepancy in the formula or rounding differences.

5. **Final Consideration**: Among the options, the closest plausible answer based on the calculations and potential adjustments is **B: 1071.6**.

ANSWER: B
