Question:

Let's assume that the 10-year annual return for the S&P 500 (market portfolio) is 10%, while the average annual return on Treasury bills (a good proxy for the risk-free rate) is 5%. Whats the market Treynor Ratio? Return the numeric value between 0 and 1.

Options:

A: 0.08
B: 0.25
C: 0.15
D: 0.5
E: 0.4
F: 0.1
G: 0.2
H: 0.05
I: 0.3
J: 0.6

Okay, so I've got this question about the Treynor Ratio, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me see what I remember about the Treynor Ratio from my studies.

First, I think the Treynor Ratio is a measure of a portfolio's return in excess of the risk-free rate per unit of systematic risk. It's kind of similar to the Sharpe Ratio, but instead of total risk, it uses beta, which measures systematic or market risk. So the formula, if I recall correctly, is (Return of the Portfolio - Risk-Free Rate) divided by Beta.

In this question, they're asking for the Market Treynor Ratio. Wait, what does that mean? Oh, right, the market portfolio is the S&P 500 here, so the market's Treynor Ratio would be calculated using the market's return, the risk-free rate, and the beta of the market. But wait, the market portfolio's beta is 1, right? Because beta is a measure of how a portfolio moves with the market, and the market itself has a beta of 1.

So the given data is: the 10-year annual return for the S&P 500 (market portfolio) is 10%. The average annual return on Treasury bills is 5%, which is the risk-free rate. So the risk-free rate (Rf) is 5%, and the market return (Rm) is 10%. 

Since the market portfolio has a beta (β) of 1, plugging into the Treynor Ratio formula: Treynor Ratio = (Rm - Rf) / β. That would be (10% - 5%) / 1, which is 5% or 0.05.

Wait, but looking at the options, option H is 0.05. So the answer should be H. But wait, let me make sure I'm not making a mistake. Did I mix up anything? Let me double-check the formula. Yes, Treynor is (Portfolio Return - Rf) / Beta. Here, the market's Portfolio Return is 10%, Rf is 5%, so 5% over beta of 1, which is indeed 5%, or 0.05.

I think that's correct. So the answer should be H: 0.05.

The Treynor Ratio is calculated as (Portfolio Return - Risk-Free Rate) divided by Beta. For the market portfolio (S&P 500), Beta is 1. Using the given returns, (10% - 5%) / 1 = 5% or 0.05.

Answer: H
