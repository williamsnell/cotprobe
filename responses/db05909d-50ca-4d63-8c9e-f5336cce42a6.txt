Question:

Which of the following statements is not correct about lipids?

Options:

A: Lipids consist of fatty acids and glycerol.
B: Steroids are examples of lipids.
C: The molecules of a saturated fatty acid are packed so close together that they form a solid at room temperature.
D: The head of a phospholipid is hydrophobic, and the tails are hydrophilic.

Okay, so I've got this question about lipids, and I need to figure out which statement isn't correct. Let me go through each option one by one. 

First, I remember that lipids are a group of organic molecules that include fats, oils, waxes, and some other compounds. They're usually made up of fatty acids and other components. 

Option A says, "Lipids consist of fatty acids and glycerol." Wait, I think that's a bit off. Because while many lipids do include fatty acids, like triglycerides, not all lipids are just fatty acids and glycerol. For example, steroids like cholesterol are also lipids but don't have glycerol. So maybe A is incorrect, but I'm not sure yet. Let me check the other options.

Option B: "Steroids are examples of lipids." That's correct. Cholesterol is a steroid, which is definitely a lipid. So B is a true statement.

Option C: "The molecules of a saturated fatty acid are packed so close together that they form a solid at room temperature." I remember that saturated fatty acids have single bonds between carbon atoms. These bonds allow the molecules to pack tightly because they can't rotate much, which leads to solid structures at room temp, like butter or lard. So C is correct.

Option D: "The head of a phospholipid is hydrophobic, and the tails are hydrophilic." Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Phospholipids have a head that's hydrophilic (water-loving) because of the phosphate group, and the tails are hydrophobic (water-fearing) fatty acid chains. So D is incorrect because it says the opposite. So D's statement is wrong.

Wait, but the question is asking which statement is NOT correct. So if D is wrong, then it's the answer. But I should double-check because I might have mixed something up.

Wait, let me think again. The head of a phospholipid is the part that's attracted to water, so it's hydrophilic. The tails are the fatty acid parts, which are hydrophobic. So D says the head is hydrophobic and tails hydrophilic. That's definitely incorrect. So D is the wrong statement.

Wait, but what about Option A? Does it say "consist of" or "include"? Because if lipids include other things besides fatty acids and glycerol, like steroids, then A would be incorrect as well. So the statement in A is only partially correct. Because while some lipids have fatty acids and glycerol, not all do. So A is incorrect in a way. 

Hmm, so now I'm a bit confused. Because both A and D might be incorrect. Let me re-examine the options.

The question is asking which statement is NOT correct. So which one is the incorrect statement about lipids.

I think Option D is definitely incorrect because the description of phospholipid structure is reversed. The head is hydrophilic, tails hydrophobic. So D is wrong.

Option A says "Lipids consist of fatty acids and glycerol." But since lipids include other types like steroids, which don't have glycerol, A is incorrect as a general statement. So both A and D might be incorrect, but looking back at the options, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, the question is about which is NOT correct. So if both A and D are wrong, but the options only have one correct answer, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, let me think again. A: "Lipids consist of fatty acids and glycerol." That's true for triglycerides, but lipids include more than just that. So the statement is not entirely correct because it's too specific. But perhaps the question is considering only one incorrect statement.

Alternatively, perhaps I should focus on which statement is definitely incorrect. D is definitely incorrect because it's the opposite of what's true. So the answer is D.

The question asks which statement is not correct about lipids. Let's analyze each option:

- **Option A**: "Lipids consist of fatty acids and glycerol." While triglycerides, a type of lipid, are made of fatty acids and glycerol, not all lipids fit this description. For example, steroids like cholesterol are lipids but do not contain glycerol. Therefore, this statement is not entirely correct.

- **Option B**: "Steroids are examples of lipids." This is correct, as steroids such as cholesterol are indeed lipids.

- **Option C**: "The molecules of a saturated fatty acid are packed so close together that they form a solid at room temperature." This is correct because saturated fatty acids have rigid structures that allow them to pack tightly, forming solids like butter or lard at room temperature.

- **Option D**: "The head of a phospholipid is hydrophobic, and the tails are hydrophilic." This is incorrect. The head of a phospholipid is hydrophilic (water-attracting), while the tails are hydrophobic (water-repelling).

Both **A** and **D** are incorrect, but **D** is definitively so because it directly contradicts the known structure of phospholipids. Therefore, the answer is:

D
