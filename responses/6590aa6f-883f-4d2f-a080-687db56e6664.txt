Okay, so I need to find the uncertainty ΔL_z for the hydrogen atom's 2p_z stationary state. Hmm, I remember that L_z is the z-component of the angular momentum. In quantum mechanics, angular momentum has certain properties, especially for stationary states.

Wait, the state is 2p_z. So the principal quantum number n is 2, and the azimuthal (or angular momentum) quantum number l is 1 because p corresponds to l=1. The magnetic quantum number m is z, so in this case, m= -1, 0, or +1, but since it's 2p_z, I think m is 0? Or wait, no, 2p_z refers to the state where m=0? Or does it mean one of the possible m values, perhaps. Wait, actually, the notation is a bit confusing me. 

Wait, in hydrogen, the stationary states are labeled by n, l, m. The energy depends on n and l, not m. So for 2p, l=1. The m values are -1, 0, +1. So the 2p_z state is when m=0. Because the z-axis is usually the quantization axis here.

Now, the uncertainty principle applies to observables. L_z is an observable, and since we're in a stationary state, which is an eigenstate of L_z, the uncertainty should be zero. Because for an eigenstate, the expectation value is the eigenvalue, and the uncertainty is the standard deviation, which is the square root of the expectation value of (L_z^2) minus (expectation of L_z)^2. But if the state is an eigenstate, then (L_z)^2 has the same eigenvalue as (L_z)^2, so the uncertainty would be zero.

Wait, wait, more carefully: The uncertainty ΔA for an observable A is sqrt(⟨A²⟩ - ⟨A⟩²). If the state is an eigenstate of A with eigenvalue a, then ⟨A⟩ = a, and ⟨A²⟩ = a², so ΔA is zero. So in this case, since the state is an eigenstate of L_z (m=0), the uncertainty ΔL_z must be zero.

Looking at the options, G is 0. So the answer should be G.

The state in question is the hydrogen atom's 2p_z stationary state. For this state, the principal quantum number \( n = 2 \), the azimuthal quantum number \( l = 1 \), and the magnetic quantum number \( m = 0 \). Since the state is an eigenstate of \( L_z \), the uncertainty \( \Delta L_z \) is zero, as the expectation value of \( L_z \) is precisely the eigenvalue, and the uncertainty principle gives \( \Delta L_z = \sqrt{\langle L_z^2 \rangle - \langle L_z \rangle^2} = 0 \).

Answer: G
