Answer:
    
<think>
Okay, so I have to solve the equation sin(4x) + x = 54 using the Newton-Raphson method and find all the roots. Hmm, but wait, the options are ranges of values, so maybe the roots are around there. Let me think.

First, I know that the Newton-Raphson method is used to find roots of equations, so here the function is f(x) = sin(4x) + x - 54. The goal is to find x such that f(x) = 0.

But wait, sin(4x) is a periodic function with period π/2 because the period of sin(kx) is 2π/k. So sin(4x) has a maximum of 1 and a minimum of -1. Therefore, sin(4x) + x = 54 implies that x ≈ 54, since sin(4x) only varies between -1 and 1. So the roots should be near x ≈ 54. But looking at the options, all the possible roots are around 52-56, so that makes sense.

Now, Newton-Raphson requires an initial guess. But since I don't have a graph, maybe I can approximate where the roots are. Let's think about f(x) = sin(4x) + x -54. Let's see, f(54) = sin(216) +54-54 = sin(216). Wait, 216 radians is a lot. Let me convert that to degrees to get an idea. Since π radians is 180 degrees, 216 radians is (216 * 180)/(π) ≈ 216 * 57.3 ≈ 12388.8 degrees, which is a lot of full circles. But sin is periodic every 360 degrees, so sin(216 radians) is the same as sin(216 - 6*2π) because 6*2π is about 37.7, so 216 -37.7≈178.3 radians. Hmm, but 178.3 radians is still a lot. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute 216 modulo 2π. Let me compute 216/(2π) ≈ 216/(6.283) ≈ 34.44. So the fractional part is 0.44. So 0.44 * 2π ≈ 2.76 radians. So sin(216) ≈ sin(2.76). What's sin(2.76)? 2.76 is in radians, which is about 158 degrees. Sin(158) is sin(180-22) = sin(22) ≈ 0.3746. So f(54) ≈ 0.3746. So f(54) is positive.

But wait, I'm trying to find where f(x) = 0. So if f(54) is positive, maybe the root is just below 54? Or maybe there are multiple roots because of the oscillation of the sine function.

Wait, let's think about the behavior of f(x) = x + sin(4x) -54. Since x is increasing, and sin(4x) oscillates between -1 and 1, the function f(x) will increase overall but with small oscillations. So as x increases, f(x) increases. So, perhaps there's only one root near x=54, because for x slightly less than 54, f(x) would be negative, and at x=54, it's positive.

Wait, but wait. Let's test x=53.5. Then f(53.5) = 53.5 + sin(4*53.5) -54 = -0.5 + sin(214). Let me compute 4*53.5=214 radians. Again, mod 2π. 214/(2π) ≈ 214/(6.283) ≈34. So 34 full circles, fractional part 0, so 214 radians is equivalent to 0 radians (since 34*2π=213.628, so 214-213.628≈0.372 radians). So sin(0.372) ≈ 0.365. So f(53.5)= -0.5 + 0.365 ≈ -0.135. So f(53.5) is negative, and f(54) is positive, so there's a root between 53.5 and 54.

But wait, the options have multiple roots, like three roots in each option. So maybe the equation has more than one solution? But wait, f(x) = x + sin(4x) -54. Since x is increasing and sin(4x) oscillates, but x is the dominant term, so f(x) is a monotonic function except for the oscillation. So maybe the function crosses zero only once, but the options suggest three roots. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the user made a mistake in the equation. Let me check: the equation is sin(4x) + x =54. Alternatively, maybe the equation is written as sin(4x) +x -54=0. So, perhaps the function is f(x) = sin(4x) +x -54.

Wait, but let's think about the equation. For x=54, sin(4*54)=sin(216 radians)=approx 0.3746, so f(54)=0.3746, which is positive. For x=53.5, as before, f(53.5)= -0.135. So function crosses from negative to positive between 53.5 and 54, so one root there.

But the options have three roots, so maybe the function has multiple crossings. Wait, perhaps I should check other values. Let's try x=55. Then f(55)=55 + sin(220) -54 =1 + sin(220). 220 radians mod 2π: 220/(2π)= ~35.06, so fractional part 0.06. 0.06 *2π ≈0.377 radians. So sin(0.377)≈0.368. So f(55)=1 +0.368≈1.368>0. So f(55) is positive.

Wait, so between x=53.5 and 54, function goes from negative to positive, so one root. Then between x=54 and 55, function increases further, so no crossing.

Wait, but perhaps when x is higher, say x=56, f(56)=56 + sin(224) -54=2 + sin(224). 224/(2π)= ~35.64, so fractional part 0.64. 0.64*2π≈4.02 radians. Sin(4.02)=sin(π + 0.958)= -sin(0.958)≈-0.816. So f(56)=2 + (-0.816)=1.184>0.

Wait, but that's still positive. So function increases with x, but the sine term causes small oscillations. So perhaps there's only one root near 54. But the options suggest three roots in each answer, like [53.52, 54.25, 54.76], which has three values. So maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the equation is sin(4x) + x^2 =54, but the user wrote sin(4x) +x=54. Hmm, perhaps a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the equation is written correctly, and perhaps the function f(x)=sin(4x)+x-54 has multiple roots because the sine term can cause the function to dip below zero again after x=54, but given that x is increasing, the overall trend is upwards, so perhaps only one root exists.

Wait, but let's think about the derivative f’(x)=4cos(4x)+1. Since cos(4x) varies between -1 and 1, so f’(x) varies between 4*(-1)+1=-3 and 4*(1)+1=5. So the derivative is always positive because the minimum is -3+1= -3? Wait, no: 4cos(4x) can be as low as -4, so 4cos(4x)+1 can be as low as -3. So f’(x) can be negative if cos(4x) < -0.25, but the function f(x) is x + sin(4x) -54. Wait, but if the derivative is sometimes negative, that could mean that the function f(x) has local maxima and minima, which could lead to multiple roots.

Wait, but if f(x) has a local maximum where f(x) dips below zero again after x=54, then maybe there are multiple roots. Let me check f(54.5): f(54.5)=54.5 + sin(4*54.5) -54=0.5 + sin(218). 218 radians mod 2π: 218/(2π)=~34.68, so fractional part 0.68. 0.68*2π≈4.276 radians. Sin(4.276)=sin(π + 1.136)= -sin(1.136)≈-0.906. So f(54.5)=0.5 -0.906≈-0.406. Wait, that's negative. Wait, but earlier at x=54, f(x)=~0.374 positive, and at x=54.5, f(x)=~-0.406. That's a big drop. So function goes from positive at x=54 to negative at x=54.5. So that suggests another root between 54 and 54.5.

Wait, that can't be right because x is increasing, and the function's overall trend is upwards, but with oscillations. So perhaps the function f(x) has multiple roots because it goes up and down.

Wait, let me compute f(54.25): x=54.25. 4x=217 radians. 217/(2π)=~34.57, so fractional part 0.57. 0.57*2π≈3.58 radians. Sin(3.58)=sin(π - (3.58-π))=sin(π - (3.58-3.1416))=sin(0.6084)≈0.572. So f(54.25)=54.25 + 0.572 -54=0.822>0.

Then at x=54.5, as before, f(54.5)=~ -0.406. So between 54.25 and 54.5, function goes from positive to negative, so another root there.

Similarly, let's check x=55: f(55)=55 + sin(220) -54=1 + sin(220). 220 mod 2π≈0.377 radians, sin≈0.368. So f(55)=1 +0.368≈1.368>0.

So between x=54.5 and 55, function goes from negative to positive, so another root there.

So that suggests three roots: one between 53.5 and 54, another between 54.25 and 54.5, and another between 54.5 and 55.

Wait, but that's three roots, but the options have three values each. So perhaps the roots are around those areas.

Wait, but let me check x=53.5: f(x)= -0.135; x=54: 0.374; so root between 53.5 and 54.

Then between 54 and 54.5, f(x) goes from 0.374 to -0.406, so another root.

Then between 54.5 and 55, f(x) goes from -0.406 to 1.368, so another root.

So three roots total.

So now, using Newton-Raphson to find these roots.

Let me pick initial guesses near each of these intervals.

First root: between 53.5 and 54.

Let's start with x0=53.75.

Compute f(53.75)=53.75 + sin(4*53.75) -54= -0.25 + sin(215). 215 mod 2π: 215/(2π)=~34.25, so fractional part 0.25. 0.25*2π≈1.57 radians, which is π/2. So sin(π/2)=1. So f(53.75)= -0.25 +1=0.75>0.

Wait, but earlier at x=53.5, f=-0.135, and at 53.75, f=0.75. So the function crosses zero between 53.5 and 53.75.

Wait, but earlier I thought the first root was between 53.5 and 54, but now with x=53.75, f(x)=0.75, which is positive. So maybe the first root is between 53.5 and 53.75.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me recompute f(53.5): 4*53.5=214 radians. 214 mod 2π: 214/(2π)=~34.0, so fractional part 0, so 214=34*2π +0, so sin(214)=sin(0)=0. So f(53.5)=53.5 +0 -54= -0.5. So f(53.5)=-0.5.

At x=53.75: f(x)=53.75 + sin(215) -54= -0.25 + sin(215). 215 mod 2π: 215 -34*2π=215 - 213.628≈1.372 radians. So sin(1.372)≈0.979. So f(53.75)= -0.25 +0.979≈0.729>0. So between 53.5 and 53.75, function goes from -0.5 to 0.729, so root in that interval.

So first root: between 53.5 and 53.75.

Let's apply Newton-Raphson here.

Let me take x0=53.6.

Compute f(53.6)=53.6 + sin(4*53.6) -54= -0.4 + sin(214.4). 214.4 mod 2π: 214.4 -34*2π=214.4-213.628≈0.772 radians. sin(0.772)=~0.700. So f(53.6)= -0.4 +0.700=0.3>0.

f'(x)=4cos(4x)+1.

At x=53.6, f'(53.6)=4cos(214.4)+1. cos(0.772)=~0.717. So f'(53.6)=4*0.717 +1≈2.868+1=3.868.

Next approximation: x1 =x0 - f(x0)/f'(x0)=53.6 - (0.3/3.868)=53.6 -0.0776≈53.5224.

Compute f(53.5224)=53.5224 + sin(4*53.5224) -54=53.5224 + sin(214.09) -54.

4*53.5224=214.0896 radians. 214.0896 mod 2π: 214.0896 -34*2π=214.0896 -213.628≈0.4616 radians.

Sin(0.4616)=~0.445.

So f(53.5224)=53.5224 +0.445 -54= (53.5224 -54) +0.445≈-0.4776 +0.445≈-0.0326.

Now, f(x1)= -0.0326.

f'(x1)=4cos(4*53.5224)+1=4cos(214.0896)+1.

cos(0.4616)=~0.895.

So f'(x1)=4*0.895 +1≈3.58 +1=4.58.

Next iteration: x2= x1 - f(x1)/f'(x1)=53.5224 - (-0.0326)/4.58≈53.5224 +0.0071≈53.5295.

Compute f(53.5295)=53.5295 + sin(4*53.5295) -54.

4*53.5295=214.118 radians. mod 2π: 214.118 -213.628≈0.49 radians.

sin(0.49)=~0.472.

So f=53.5295 +0.472 -54≈(53.5295-54)+0.472≈-0.4705 +0.472≈0.0015.

f(x2)=~0.0015.

f'(x2)=4cos(4*53.5295)+1=4cos(214.118)+1.

cos(0.49)=~0.887.

f'(x2)=4*0.887 +1≈3.548+1=4.548.

Next iteration: x3= x2 - f(x2)/f'(x2)=53.5295 - (0.0015)/4.548≈53.5295 -0.00033≈53.52917.

So f(x3)=53.52917 + sin(4*53.52917) -54.

4x=214.1167 radians. mod 2π: 0.487 radians.

sin(0.487)=~0.469.

f=53.52917 +0.469 -54≈-0.47083 +0.469≈-0.00183.

Hmm, oscillating around the root. Let's take the average of x2 and x3: ~53.5293.

So one root is approximately 53.529, which matches option A's first value 53.52.

Now, the second root is between 54.25 and 54.5.

Let me take x0=54.375 as initial guess.

Compute f(54.375)=54.375 + sin(4*54.375) -54=0.375 + sin(217.5).

4*54.375=217.5 radians. mod 2π: 217.5/(2π)=~34.6, so fractional part 0.6.

0.6*2π≈3.77 radians.

sin(3.77)=sin(π + 0.628)= -sin(0.628)=~-0.587.

So f(54.375)=0.375 -0.587≈-0.212.

f'(x)=4cos(4x)+1.

At x=54.375, 4x=217.5 radians. cos(217.5)=cos(3.77)=cos(π +0.628)= -cos(0.628)=~ -0.816.

So f'(x)=4*(-0.816)+1≈-3.264 +1= -2.264.

Now, Newton-Raphson step: x1 =x0 - f(x0)/f'(x0)=54.375 - (-0.212)/(-2.264)=54.375 - (0.212/2.264)=54.375 -0.0937≈54.2813.

Compute f(54.2813)=54.2813 + sin(4*54.2813) -54=0.2813 + sin(217.1252).

4*54.2813=217.1252 radians. mod 2π: 217.1252 -34*2π=217.1252 -213.628≈3.4972 radians.

sin(3.4972)=sin(π + 0.3556)= -sin(0.3556)=~-0.348.

So f=0.2813 -0.348≈-0.0667.

f'(x1)=4cos(217.1252)+1=4cos(3.4972)+1.

cos(3.4972)=cos(π +0.3556)= -cos(0.3556)=~ -0.938.

So f'(x1)=4*(-0.938)+1≈-3.752 +1= -2.752.

Next iteration: x2=54.2813 - (-0.0667)/(-2.752)=54.2813 - (0.0667/2.752)=54.2813 -0.0242≈54.2571.

Compute f(x2)=54.2571 + sin(4*54.2571) -54=0.2571 + sin(217.0284).

4x=217.0284 radians. mod 2π:217.0284 -34*2π=217.0284 -213.628≈3.4004 radians.

sin(3.4004)=sin(π +0.2588)= -sin(0.2588)=~-0.255.

So f=0.2571 -0.255≈0.0021.

f'(x2)=4cos(217.0284)+1=4cos(3.4004)+1.

cos(3.4004)=cos(π +0.2588)= -cos(0.2588)=~ -0.966.

f'(x2)=4*(-0.966)+1≈-3.864 +1= -2.864.

Next iteration: x3=54.2571 - (0.0021)/(-2.864)=54.2571 +0.00073≈54.2578.

Check f(x3)=54.2578 + sin(4*54.2578) -54=0.2578 + sin(217.0312).

4x=217.0312 radians. mod 2π:217.0312 -34*2π=3.4032 radians.

sin(3.4032)=sin(π +0.2616)= -sin(0.2616)=~-0.258.

So f=0.2578 -0.258≈-0.0002.

Now, f(x3)=~ -0.0002.

f'(x3)=4cos(3.4032)+1=4*(-cos(0.2616))+1=4*(-0.966)+1≈-3.864 +1= -2.864.

Next iteration: x4=54.2578 - (-0.0002)/(-2.864)=54.2578 - (0.0002/2.864)=54.2578 -0.00007≈54.2577.

So root approx 54.2577, which rounds to 54.26, matching option A's second value 54.25.

Now, the third root is between 54.5 and 55.

Let's take x0=54.75.

Compute f(54.75)=54.75 + sin(4*54.75) -54=0.75 + sin(219). 219 mod 2π:219 -34*2π=219 -213.628≈5.372 radians.

sin(5.372)=sin(2π -0.890)= -sin(0.890)=~-0.777.

So f=0.75 -0.777≈-0.027.

f'(x)=4cos(4x)+1=4cos(219)+1.

cos(219)=cos(5.372)=cos(2π -0.890)=cos(0.890)=~0.621.

Wait, no: cos(5.372)=cos(2π -0.890)=cos(0.890)=0.621? Wait, cos(5.372)=cos(2π -0.890)=cos(0.890)=0.621? Wait, 5.372 radians is equivalent to -0.890 radians, so cos is positive. So f'(x)=4*0.621 +1≈2.484 +1=3.484.

Next iteration: x1=54.75 - (-0.027)/3.484≈54.75 +0.00776≈54.75776.

Compute f(54.75776)=54.75776 + sin(4*54.75776) -54=0.75776 + sin(219.031).

4x=219.031 radians. mod 2π:219.031 -34*2π=219.031 -213.628≈5.403 radians.

sin(5.403)=sin(2π -0.878)= -sin(0.878)=~-0.767.

So f=0.75776 -0.767≈-0.00924.

f'(x1)=4cos(219.031)+1=4cos(5.403)+1=4*cos(0.878)=4*0.635≈2.54 +1=3.54.

Next iteration: x2=54.75776 - (-0.00924)/3.54≈54.75776 +0.00261≈54.76037.

Compute f(54.76037)=54.76037 + sin(4*54.76037) -54=0.76037 + sin(219.0415).

4x=219.0415 radians. mod 2π:219.0415 -34*2π=219.0415 -213.628≈5.4135 radians.

sin(5.4135)=sin(2π -0.868)= -sin(0.868)=~-0.758.

So f=0.76037 -0.758≈0.00237.

f'(x2)=4cos(5.4135)+1=4*cos(0.868)+1=4*0.645≈2.58 +1=3.58.

Next iteration: x3=54.76037 - 0.00237/3.58≈54.76037 -0.00066≈54.7597.

Check f(x3)=54.7597 + sin(4*54.7597) -54=0.7597 + sin(219.0388).

4x=219.0388 mod 2π≈5.4108 radians.

sin(5.4108)=sin(2π -0.871)= -sin(0.871)=~-0.763.

f=0.7597 -0.763≈-0.0033.

f'(x3)=4cos(5.4108)+1=4*cos(0.871)+1=4*0.639≈2.556 +1=3.556.

x4=54.7597 - (-0.0033)/3.556≈54.7597 +0.00093≈54.7606.

f(x4)=54.7606 + sin(4*54.7606) -54=0.7606 + sin(219.0424).

4x=219.0424 mod 2π≈5.4144 radians.

sin(5.4144)=sin(2π -0.868)= -sin(0.868)=~-0.758.

f=0.7606 -0.758≈0.0026.

Hmm, oscillating around 54.76. So the root is approximately 54.76, matching option A's third value 54.76.

So the three roots are approximately 53.52, 54.25, and 54.76, which matches option A.

The equation \( \sin(4x) + x = 54 \) is solved using the Newton-Raphson method to find all roots. The function \( f(x) = \sin(4x) + x - 54 \) is analyzed, and its behavior is determined by considering the periodic nature of the sine term and the linear term \( x \). The function oscillates due to the sine term but overall increases with \( x \). By evaluating \( f(x) \) at various points, it is found that there are three roots: one near \( x \approx 53.52 \), another near \( x \approx 54.25 \), and a third near \( x \approx 54.76 \). These values match the options provided, specifically option A.
