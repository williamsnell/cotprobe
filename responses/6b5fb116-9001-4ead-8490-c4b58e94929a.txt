Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about Robert and the promotional campaign he's working on. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand it. Robert is a marketer for a global company and is working on a campaign for a new international market. He wants to make sure the campaign is clearly understood and doesn't offend anyone. The question is asking which external environment factor he's influenced by.

The options are A through J, covering various environments like economic, socio-cultural, geographic, etc. I think the key here is that he's targeting a new international market and is concerned about understanding and not offending the local consumers. So, I need to figure out which environmental factor deals with cultural aspects that could affect marketing.

Let me go through each option one by one. 

A: Economic environment. That's about the economy, like income levels, inflation, etc. While the economy affects purchasing power, the question is more about understanding and cultural aspects, not just the money part.

B: Socio-cultural environment. This includes the cultural norms, values, beliefs, and social structures. Since Robert is concerned about not offending anyone, this seems relevant. Cultural differences can impact how a campaign is received.

C: Geographic environment. This refers to physical geography and how it affects marketing, like climate or location. While geography is a factor, the question is more about the social aspects rather than the physical environment.

D: Political environment. This involves government policies, laws, and political stability. While important, the question doesn't mention anything about politics or government regulations, so this might not be the main factor here.

E: Competitive environment. This is about competitors and market competition. The question doesn't focus on competitors but rather on consumer understanding and cultural sensitivity.

F: Legal environment. This includes laws and regulations that businesses must comply with. Again, the question isn't about legal issues but more about cultural understanding.

G: Technological environment. This deals with technology and its impact on marketing. The question doesn't mention technology specifically, so probably not this one.

H: Natural environment. This is about natural resources and the physical environment. Doesn't seem directly related to cultural understanding.

I: International environment. This could involve factors related to international trade, but I'm not sure. The question is more about the specific market's culture rather than international trade aspects.

J: Demographic environment. This involves the study of populations, like age, gender, income, etc. While demographics are important, the question is more about the cultural aspects that could cause offense.

So, putting it all together, the most relevant factor here is the socio-cultural environment because it directly relates to cultural norms and values that influence how the campaign is received. Robert needs to understand the local culture to ensure the campaign is effective and doesn't offend anyone.

The correct answer is B: Socio-cultural environment. This factor involves understanding cultural norms and values, which is crucial for creating a campaign that resonates and avoids offense in a new market.
