Question:

Behaviorist views have been criticized by other approaches for a number of reasons. Ethologists argued that the behaviorists ignored innate, built-in biases in learning due to evolution, but also disagreed with:

Options:

A: the focus on negative reinforcement
B: the emphasis on observation over experimentation
C: the use of the trial-and-error system
D: the application of cognitive theory
E: the disregard for individual differences in behavior
F: the use of the operant conditioning principle
G: the use of the animals in laboratory experiments
H: the use of the classical conditioning principle
I: the use of the humans in laboratory experiments

Okay, so I've got this question about behaviorist views and their criticism from ethologists. Hmm, I remember that behaviorism is a psychological approach that focuses on observable behavior rather than internal mental states. Behaviorists like Skinner and Pavlov were all about how the environment shapes behavior through conditioning, right? So they used methods like classical and operant conditioning to explain learning.

Now, the question is about what ethologists disagreed with. Ethologists study animal behavior in their natural habitats, so they probably have a different perspective. I think ethologists argue that behaviorists ignored the innate, or built-in, behaviors that are part of an organism's evolutionary history. For example, instinctual behaviors that are not learned through the environment. So they might say that behaviorists focus too much on how the environment shapes behavior without considering these innate tendencies.

Looking at the options, the question says ethologists not only pointed out that behaviorists ignored innate biases but also disagreed with something else. So I need to find what else they disagreed on.

Option A: the focus on negative reinforcement. Negative reinforcement is when you remove an unpleasant stimulus to increase a behavior. I don't know if ethologists particularly focused on this; it seems more about the methods rather than the type of reinforcement.

Option B: the emphasis on observation over experimentation. Behaviorists do a lot of controlled experiments, so I'm not sure. Maybe ethologists prefer naturalistic observations, but I'm not certain if this is the main point of disagreement.

Option C: the use of trial-and-error system. Trial and error is a learning method where an organism tries different responses until it finds one that works. Behaviorists do explain learning in terms of trial and error, especially in operant conditioning. But I'm not sure if ethologists specifically disagreed with this approach.

Option D: the application of cognitive theory. Behaviorists were often criticized for ignoring cognition, focusing only on observable behaviors. Ethologists might agree with that, but the question is about what ethologists disagreed with, not just behaviorists' limitations.

Option E: the disregard for individual differences in behavior. Behaviorists might have focused on general principles rather than individual differences, but I'm not sure if that's what ethologists specifically pointed out.

Option F: the use of operant conditioning principle. Operant conditioning is a key part of behaviorism, where behavior is modified by consequences. Ethologists might not have a problem with the principle itself but perhaps with how behaviorists applied it without considering innate factors.

Option G: the use of animals in laboratory experiments. Ethologists might criticize the use of animals in labs because they prefer observing animals in their natural settings. But the question is about what they disagreed with in behaviorist views, not methods.

Option H: the use of classical conditioning principle. Classical conditioning is another cornerstone of behaviorism. Again, ethologists might not disagree with the principle but with the neglect of innate behaviors.

Option I: the use of humans in laboratory experiments. Similar to G, probably about methodology, not the theory itself.

So, the main point is that ethologists argue behaviorists ignored innate, evolutionary-based biases. So what else did they disagree on? Maybe the behaviorist's overreliance on conditioning without considering these innate factors.

Looking again, the options are about specific aspects. The question says ethologists argued that behaviorists ignored the innate biases and also disagreed with something else. So what else? Maybe the behaviorist's disregard for innate behaviors in favor of learned ones. But looking at the options, I don't see something about that.

Wait, perhaps ethologists also disagreed with the behaviorist's approach to learning as something that's entirely shaped by the environment, without considering instincts or species-typical behaviors. So maybe the behaviorists didn't account for these, which ethologists pointed out.

Looking at the options, perhaps the answer is E: the disregard for individual differences in behavior. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's about the methods, like focusing too much on reinforcement without considering the organism's predispositions.

Wait, another angle: Behaviorists used laboratory experiments with animals, focusing on controlled settings. Ethologists might have disagreed with this approach because they study animals in their natural environments. So perhaps the answer is G or H, but the question is about what they disagreed with in behaviorist views, not their methods.

Wait, the question is about what ethologists disagreed with. So maybe they disagreed with the idea that all behavior is learned and shaped by the environment, without considering innate factors. But the specific options don't directly state that.

Looking again, the options are about specific aspects of behaviorist approaches. The question says ethologists argued that behaviorists ignored innate biases and disagreed with something else.

Wait, perhaps they also disagreed with the behaviorist's focus on reinforcement, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe they disagreed with the emphasis on observable behaviors and not considering internal states or cognition.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck. Let me think about what ethologists like Konrad Lorenz focused on. They studied instinctual behavior, fixed action patterns, and how these are part of an organism's biology. They probably criticized behaviorists for not considering these innate behaviors and focusing only on what could be learned through the environment.

So, besides ignoring innate biases, what else? Maybe the behaviorist's dismissal of internal states or cognitive processes. But option D is about cognitive theory, which is more of a later development.

Alternatively, perhaps ethologists disagreed with the behaviorist's emphasis on controlled experiments (like in labs) rather than naturalistic observations. So that would point to option B, but I'm not sure if that's the main point.

Wait, the question says ethologists argued that behaviorists ignored innate biases due to evolution and also disagreed with something else. So the something else must be another point of criticism.

I think another point is that behaviorists focused on external, observable behaviors and didn't consider internal mental processes or innate tendencies. So perhaps ethologists also disagreed with the behaviorist's approach to learning, like trial and error, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe they disagreed with the behaviorist's use of animals in lab experiments, but that's more about methodology than theory.

Wait, perhaps the answer is E: the disregard for individual differences. Because ethologists might argue that behavior isn't just shaped by the environment but also by individual predispositions and genetic factors. So behaviorists might have overlooked individual differences in learning.

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe they disagreed with the use of trial-and-error as the primary method of learning, but that's part of behaviorist theories.

Another angle: the question is about what ethologists disagreed with, in addition to ignoring innate biases. Maybe they also disagreed with the behaviorist's focus on reinforcement schedules or the principles of conditioning without considering the organism's natural tendencies.

Wait, I think I'm overcomplicating it. The main points of criticism from ethologists towards behaviorists are that they ignored the influence of biological and evolutionary factors, focusing solely on environmental factors. So besides that, perhaps they also disagreed with the behaviorist's methods, like using animals in labs (option G), but the question is about their views, not methods.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is H: the use of classical conditioning principle. But that seems unlikely because classical conditioning is a valid concept.

Wait, maybe the answer is E: the disregard for individual differences. Because ethologists might argue that behavior isn't uniform across individuals and that behaviorists didn't account for that.

I'm still a bit confused, but I think the most likely answer is E: the disregard for individual differences in behavior. Because ethologists would consider that each organism has its own predispositions and learning styles, which behaviorists might have ignored by focusing on general principles.

The question asks what ethologists disagreed with regarding behaviorist views, in addition to the criticism that behaviorists ignored innate, evolution-based biases in learning. Behaviorism focuses on observable behavior and environmental influences, while ethology emphasizes innate behaviors and natural settings. Ethologists likely disagreed with behaviorists' disregard for individual differences in behavior, as they recognize that organisms have unique predispositions and learning styles shaped by both genetics and environment. This aligns with the idea that ethologists critique behaviorism for overlooking innate factors and individual variability.
