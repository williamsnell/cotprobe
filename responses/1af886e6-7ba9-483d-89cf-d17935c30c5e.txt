A 76-year-old man comes to the office because of early awakening at night. He has no difficulty falling asleep but routinely wakes up between 2:00 and 3:00 AM. The patient is a retired postal worker, and he has always been physically active. He has diabetes mellitus controlled by diet. The patient drinks one cup of coffee in the morning with breakfast and usually walks for exercise in the morning. Before retiring at night he has one alcoholic beverage. He has no history of depression, nightmares, or snoring and he takes no over-the-counter medications. His wife of 45 years is also in good health. Vital signs are temperature 37.1°C (98.8°F), pulse 96/min and regular, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 135/90 mm Hg. Physical examination shows a well-nourished, well-developed man. He is not obese. Examination of the head and neck is normal; there are no bruits or jugular venous distention. Chest is clear, and heart is normal with S1 and S2. Abdomen is soft and nontender with active bowel sounds and no organomegaly. Rectal examination discloses no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate management of this patient's insomnia?

Options:

A: Recommend the patient to watch television before going to bed.
B: Prescribe sleeping pills
C: Advise the patient to read and snack in bed to relax
D: Recommend a daytime nap to compensate for lost sleep
E: Prescribe a vigorous pre-bedtime exercise regimen

Okay, so I've got this question about a 76-year-old man with insomnia. Let's see, he's having trouble sleeping because he wakes up early in the morning, around 2-3 AM. He doesn't have trouble falling asleep, though. He's a retired postal worker and has always been active. He has diabetes controlled by diet, takes a cup of coffee in the morning, walks for exercise, and has a drink before bed. No history of depression, nightmares, or snoring. His vitals are okay, and physical exam shows nothing unusual. His wife is healthy too.

So the question is about the best management for his insomnia. The options are A to J, each suggesting a different approach.

First, I need to think about the possible causes of his early awakening. He's on a drink before bed, which is alcohol. Alcohol can affect sleep. It might help him fall asleep, but it can disrupt REM sleep and cause awakenings in the early morning. That fits with his symptoms.

His other habits: coffee in the morning. Caffeine can stay in the system for several hours, so maybe that's contributing, but he's drinking it in the morning, so maybe the effect is already waned by bedtime. He's active, which is good for sleep, but maybe the timing of his exercise is an issue? He walks in the morning, so that's probably fine.

He doesn't have depression, so it's not likely caused by that. No snoring suggests no sleep apnea, which is a common cause of early awakenings.

Looking at the options:

A: Watch TV before bed. TV can be stimulating, so that might not help. Might make it harder to fall asleep.

B: Sleeping pills. Could help, but considering he's on alcohol, combining with pills might be risky. Also, they can have dependence and tolerance issues, and he's an older adult, so more cautious with medications.

C: Read and snack in bed. Reading might be okay, but snacking could cause indigestion, which can disrupt sleep. Also, eating in bed is not great for sleep hygiene.

D: Nap during the day. If he's waking up early, a nap might make it harder to sleep at night, worsening the problem. Plus, he's already active, so maybe not necessary.

E: Vigorous pre-bedtime exercise. Exercise is good for sleep, but vigorous exercise before bed can increase adrenaline and make it harder to fall asleep. So that's probably not a good idea.

F: Sertraline. That's an antidepressant, often used for depression and anxiety. But the patient doesn't have depression, so this seems unnecessary unless he has undiagnosed anxiety, which isn't indicated here.

G: Low-carb diet. His diabetes is controlled by diet, but low-carb might help blood sugar, but I'm not sure how that ties to his sleep issue.

H: Discontinue bedtime drink. Since he has a drink before bed, which is alcohol, this could help. Alcohol disrupts sleep, leading to early awakenings.

I: Drink earlier in the day. This might help, as the alcohol would metabolize before bedtime, reducing its effect on sleep. But he's already having a drink before bed, so maybe moving it up a few hours could help.

J: Increase caffeine. More caffeine could interfere with sleep, especially if he's sensitive, but he's only having one cup in the morning. More might make it harder to fall asleep.

So considering all this, the most likely cause is the alcohol before bed. So the best advice would be to stop the bedtime drink (option H) or have it earlier (I). Between H and I, I think H is more direct—discontinuing the bedtime alcohol. Alternatively, maybe advising to have it earlier would be a better approach because completely stopping might be hard for him.

But looking at the options, H is to discontinue the bedtime drink, and I is to drink earlier. Both could be correct, but which is more appropriate? The question asks for the most appropriate management. Since alcohol close to bedtime is more disruptive, advising to stop the bedtime drink (H) might be better. Alternatively, option I is also a good option. But in clinical practice, I think advising to avoid alcohol before bed is more standard. So probably H is the best answer.

The patient's early awakening is likely due to his bedtime alcohol consumption, as alcohol disrupts REM sleep and can cause awakenings. Other options like television, reading, or snacks in bed, vigorous exercise before bed, or medications like sleeping pills or antidepressants are less appropriate. Discontinuing the bedtime drink (H) is the most direct and effective advice.

Answer: H
