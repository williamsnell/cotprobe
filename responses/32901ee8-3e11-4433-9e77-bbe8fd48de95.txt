Question:

Spark Co. buys cordless phones for $125 each and sells them for $200 each. Spark pays a sales commission of $25 per phone sold and monthly fixed costs are $3000. Assuming Spark desired a profit of 10% of sales how many units must Spark sell?

Options:

A: 400
B: 1000
C: 600
D: 800
E: 500
F: 200
G: 900
H: 700
I: 300
J: 100

Okay, so I've got this problem here about Spark Co. buying and selling cordless phones. I need to figure out how many units they must sell to achieve a 10% profit on sales. Let me break it down step by step.

First, let me list out the given information:

- Cost per phone: $125
- Selling price per phone: $200
- Sales commission per phone: $25
- Monthly fixed costs: $3,000
- Desired profit: 10% of sales

Hmm, wait, 10% of salesâ€”so that's 10% of the total revenue they make from selling the phones. I need to calculate the number of units they need to sell to reach that profit.

Alright, let's define some variables to make this clearer. Let's say the number of units sold is 'x'.

Revenue per unit is the selling price, which is $200. So total revenue would be 200x.

Now, the cost per unit is $125, so the cost of goods sold (COGS) would be 125x. But wait, there's also a sales commission of $25 per phone. So the total variable costs per phone are 125 + 25 = $150. So total variable costs would be 150x.

Fixed costs are $3,000 per month, so that's a constant.

So, the total costs would be fixed costs plus variable costs: 3000 + 150x.

Profit is calculated as total revenue minus total costs. But the desired profit is 10% of sales. Sales here would be the total revenue, right? So desired profit is 0.10 * 200x = 20x.

Wait, let me make sure. The problem says "desired a profit of 10% of sales." So, profit = 10% of total sales, which is 10% of 200x, so that's 20x.

So, the equation would be:

Profit = Total Revenue - Total Costs
20x = (200x) - (3000 + 150x)

Let me write that out:

20x = 200x - 3000 - 150x

Simplify the right side:

200x - 150x = 50x

So, 20x = 50x - 3000

Hmm, let's rearrange this equation to solve for x.

Subtract 50x from both sides:

20x - 50x = -3000

-30x = -3000

Divide both sides by -30:

x = (-3000)/(-30) = 100

Wait, so x is 100? That would mean they need to sell 100 units. But looking at the options, J is 100. But wait, that seems low. Let me check my calculations again because 100 units might not cover the fixed costs adequately.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the profit. Let me think again. Profit is 10% of sales, which is 10% of (200x), so 20x. So the equation is Profit = 20x.

Total costs are fixed + variable: 3000 + 150x.

So, Profit = Revenue - Costs: 200x - (3000 + 150x) = 20x.

So, 200x - 3000 -150x = 20x.

Which simplifies to 50x -3000 =20x.

Subtract 20x: 30x -3000=0.

30x =3000.

x=3000/30=100.

Hmm, that still gives me 100 units. But let me think again: is the profit correctly calculated as 10% of sales? Or is it 10% on cost? The problem says "profit of 10% of sales," so I think it's correct.

Wait, but let me double-check. If they sell 100 units:

Revenue: 100 *200 = $20,000.

Variable costs: 100*(125+25)=15,000.

Fixed costs:3,000.

Total costs:15,000+3,000=18,000.

Profit:20,000-18,000=2,000.

Desired profit is 10% of sales:10% of 20,000 is 2,000. So yes, that matches.

So the answer should be 100 units, which is option J.

But wait, I'm a bit confused because 100 units seem low, but the math checks out. Let me think if there's another way to approach this.

Alternatively, maybe the desired profit is 10% on the cost, but the question says 10% of sales, so that's on revenue. So I think my calculation is correct.

To determine how many units Spark Co. must sell to achieve a 10% profit on sales, we start by defining the variables and calculating the necessary components:

1. **Revenue per unit**: $200  
   **Total Revenue** = 200x

2. **Cost per unit**: $125 (COGS) + $25 (commission) = $150  
   **Total Variable Costs** = 150x

3. **Fixed Costs**: $3,000

4. **Total Costs** = Fixed Costs + Variable Costs = 3,000 + 150x

5. **Desired Profit**: 10% of sales = 10% of Total Revenue = 0.10 * 200x = 20x

The profit equation is:  
**Profit** = Total Revenue - Total Costs  
20x = 200x - (3,000 + 150x)

Simplifying:  
20x = 50x - 3,000  
-30x = -3,000  
x = 100

Thus, Spark Co. must sell **100 units** to achieve the desired profit.
