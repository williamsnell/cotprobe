Okay, so I've got this problem about parallel computing, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by understanding what's being asked here.

The problem says that a particular parallel program takes 100 seconds when run on a single processor. Now, 40% of this computation is inherently sequential, meaning that part can't be sped up by adding more processors. The question is asking for the best possible elapsed times when running this program on 2 and 4 processors, respectively.

Hmm, so first, I need to break down the computation into the sequential part and the parallelizable part. Since 40% is sequential, that leaves 60% that can be parallelized. Let me calculate the time each part takes on a single processor.

The total time on one processor is 100 seconds. So, 40% is sequential, which would be 0.4 * 100 = 40 seconds. The remaining 60% is parallelizable, so that's 0.6 * 100 = 60 seconds.

Wait, no, wait a minute. I think I got that right. So the sequential part takes 40 seconds, and the parallel part takes 60 seconds on one processor.

Now, when we add more processors, the sequential part can't be sped up. It will always take 40 seconds, regardless of the number of processors. But the parallel part can be divided among the processors, reducing the time it takes.

The formula I remember for parallel execution time is something like: the parallel time is the sequential part plus the parallel part divided by the number of processors.

So for P processors, the elapsed time T would be:

T = Sequential_time + (Parallel_time / P)

But wait, I'm not sure if that's exactly right. Let me think again. The parallel part can be split among the processors, so each processor handles a fraction of it. So the time for the parallel part on P processors would be the parallel time divided by P, right? Because with more processors, each does less work, so the time reduces.

So, the total time is the sum of the sequential part (which can't be reduced) and the parallel part divided by the number of processors.

So, let's compute for 2 processors first.

Parallel part is 60 seconds on one processor. On 2 processors, it would take 60 / 2 = 30 seconds.

Adding the sequential part: 40 + 30 = 70 seconds.

Wait, but wait, that's the total time for 2 processors. So with 2 processors, it's 70 seconds.

Now for 4 processors, the parallel part would take 60 / 4 = 15 seconds.

Adding the sequential part: 40 + 15 = 55 seconds.

So the times would be 70 seconds for 2 processors and 55 seconds for 4 processors.

Looking at the options, option F is 70 and 55 seconds. So that's the one.

Let me double-check. The sequential part is 40 seconds, which stays the same. The parallel part is 60 seconds. So for 2 processors, 60/2 is 30, plus 40 is 70. For 4 processors, 60/4 is 15, plus 40 is 55. Yep, that seems right.

Wait, but another approach: sometimes in parallel computing, the speedup is calculated as 1/(1 - s), where s is the fraction that's parallel. Hmm, but I'm not sure that applies directly here. Let me think again.

Wait, no, that formula is for when the entire computation can be parallelized, but in this case, only 60% can be. So the speedup would be limited by the sequential part. So the maximum speedup is determined by the parallel fraction. The speedup S is 1/(1 - s), where s is the fraction that's parallel. Here, s is 0.6, so S would be 1/(1-0.6) = 1/0.4 = 2.5. So the ideal time is T = 100 / 2.5 = 40 seconds. But wait, that's if the entire computation can be parallelized beyond the sequential part. But wait, no, because the sequential part can't be sped up, so the total time can't be less than the sequential time. So the speedup applies only to the parallel part.

Hmm, maybe I'm confusing the concepts here. Let me try a different approach.

The total time on one processor is T1 = 40 + 60 = 100 seconds.

When using P processors, the time is Tp = 40 + (60 / P).

So for P=2: 40 + 30 = 70.

For P=4: 40 + 15 = 55.

Yes, that's correct. So the answer should be F: 70 and 55 seconds.

The problem involves determining the best possible elapsed times for a parallel program running on 2 and 4 processors. The total computation time on a single processor is 100 seconds, with 40% (40 seconds) being inherently sequential and 60% (60 seconds) parallelizable.

For 2 processors:
- The parallel part takes \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) seconds.
- Adding the sequential part: \( 40 + 30 = 70 \) seconds.

For 4 processors:
- The parallel part takes \( \frac{60}{4} = 15 \) seconds.
- Adding the sequential part: \( 40 + 15 = 55 \) seconds.

Thus, the best possible times are 70 seconds for 2 processors and 55 seconds for 4 processors.
