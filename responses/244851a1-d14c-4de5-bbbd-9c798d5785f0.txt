Question:

Which group is composed entirely of individuals who maintained that species are fixed (i.e., unchanging)?

Options:

A: Aristotle, Darwin, and Lamarck
B: Aristotle, Lyell, and Darwin
C: Aristotle, Linnaeus, and Cuvier
D: Aristotle, Cuvier, and Lamarck
E: Linnaeus, Darwin, and Lamarck
F: Linnaeus, Cuvier, and Lamarck
G: Darwin, Cuvier, and Lamarck
H: Lyell, Cuvier, and Darwin
I: Lyell, Linnaeus, and Lamarck
J: Lyell, Lamarck, and Darwin

Okay, I need to figure out which group consists entirely of people who believed that species are fixed and unchanging. Let's go through each option one by one.

First, I should recall what each scientist's stance was on species. 

Aristotle: I remember he was an ancient Greek philosopher who thought that species were fixed and could not change. He believed in the immutability of species, which fits with the idea of fixed species.

Darwin: He's famous for his theory of evolution by natural selection, which suggests that species can and do change over time. So Darwin doesn't fit into the group that thinks species are fixed.

Lamarck: He proposed the idea of inheritance of acquired characteristics, which is part of early evolutionary thought. So he also didn't believe species were fixed.

Linnaeus: He was a taxonomist who classified organisms into a system of species and genus, etc. He viewed species as fixed and distinct, so he fits the group.

Cuvier: He was a French zoologist who believed in catastrophism and that species were fixed. He thought that species were created and could only be destroyed by catastrophic events, not through gradual change.

Lyell: He was a geologist known for his work on geology, promoting uniformitarianism, which is about gradual changes over time. But I think he was more about geological processes than biological species. However, I'm not entirely sure if he had a specific stance on species being fixed. I might need to check that.

Now, looking at the options:

Option C: Aristotle, Linnaeus, and Cuvier. All three believed species are fixed. That seems correct.

Option F: Linnaeus, Cuvier, and Lamarck. Wait, Lamarck didn't believe species were fixed, so this can't be right.

Option D: Aristotle, Cuvier, Lamarck. Again, Lamarck is in there, so no.

Option E: Linnaeus, Darwin, Lamarck. Both Darwin and Lamarck don't fit, so no.

Option G: Darwin, Cuvier, Lamarck. Darwin doesn't fit, so no.

Option H: Lyell, Cuvier, Darwin. Darwin is out, so no.

Option I: Lyell, Linnaeus, Lamarck. Lamarck again, so no.

Option J: Lyell, Lamarck, Darwin. Again, Lamarck and Darwin are wrong.

Option A: Aristotle, Darwin, Lamarck. Both Darwin and Lamarck are incorrect.

Option B: Aristotle, Lyell, Darwin. Darwin is wrong.

So the only option where all three believed species were fixed is option C: Aristotle, Linnaeus, and Cuvier.

The correct answer is C: Aristotle, Linnaeus, and Cuvier, as all three maintained that species are fixed and unchanging.

Answer: C
