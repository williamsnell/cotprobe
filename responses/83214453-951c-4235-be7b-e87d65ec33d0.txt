Okay, so I have this question about John Stuart Mill's distinction between justice and other moral obligations. I'm not super familiar with Mill's exact theories, but I remember that he talked about justice in Utilitarian terms. Let me think through this.

The question is asking what distinction corresponds perfectly to the one between justice and other moral obligations. The options are A to J, each giving a different pair. I need to figure out which pair matches.

I remember that in Mill's work, particularly in "Utilitarianism," he discusses the nature of moral obligations. He distinguishes between different types of duties. One concept I recall is that of perfect and imperfect obligations. Perfect obligations are those that can be fulfilled immediately, like not breaking a promise, whereas imperfect obligations are more open-ended, like doing good deeds in general.

Wait, so if justice is a perfect obligation, then other moral obligations might fall under imperfect. So the distinction between justice and others would align with perfect vs. imperfect. Looking at the options, I see option I is "perfect and imperfect obligations." That seems to fit.

But let me double-check. Other options: A is strong and weak duties. I'm not sure that's it. B is personal vs. public—maybe, but I think the key is about the nature of the obligations themselves, not their scope. C is conscious vs. unconscious, which seems more about awareness than the type of duty. D is absolute vs. relative, which might relate, but I think it's more about whether duties are fixed or variable. E is positive vs. negative, which refers to actions vs. omissions, not sure. F is moral vs. ethical—probably the same thing. G is direct vs. indirect, which is about the effect, not the obligation's nature. H is legal vs. illegal, which is about law, not morality. J is urgent vs. non-urgent, which is about timing, not the type.

So yeah, I think I is the correct answer because Mill's distinction between justice as a perfect obligation and others as imperfect makes sense. He sees justice as a stronger, more specific duty that can be immediately addressed, while other obligations are more general and ongoing.

The distinction between justice and other moral obligations corresponds to the distinction between perfect and imperfect obligations. Mill views justice as a perfect obligation, which can be fulfilled immediately, whereas other moral obligations are imperfect, being more open-ended and general.
