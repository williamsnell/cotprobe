Okay, so I have this series to analyze: the sum from n=0 to infinity of (n-1)/(n^3 +1). I need to figure out if it converges or diverges. Hmm, let's break this down.

First, I remember that when dealing with series convergence, especially for positive term series, comparison tests are often useful. But wait, in this case, the terms might not always be positive. Let me check the first few terms to see.

When n=0: The term is (0-1)/(0 +1) = (-1)/1 = -1.
n=1: (1-1)/(1 +1) = 0/2 = 0.
n=2: (2-1)/(8+1) = 1/9 ≈ 0.111.
n=3: (3-1)/(27+1) = 2/28 ≈ 0.071.
n=4: 3/(64+1) ≈ 3/65 ≈ 0.046.

So for n ≥ 2, the terms are positive, but for n=0, it's negative. But since the series starts at n=0, the first term is -1, then 0, and then positive terms. But the convergence is about the behavior as n approaches infinity, so maybe the initial terms don't affect it too much.

I think the best approach is to test for absolute convergence. So, take the absolute value of the terms: |(n-1)/(n^3 +1)|. Let's see how this behaves for large n.

As n gets very large, the numerator is roughly n, and the denominator is roughly n^3. So the terms behave like n/(n^3) = 1/n². I know that the series sum 1/n² converges (it's a p-series with p=2 >1). So if the absolute value of our terms is bounded above by a convergent series, then by the Comparison Test, the original series converges absolutely.

Wait, but let me make sure. The Comparison Test says that if 0 ≤ a_n ≤ b_n for all n beyond some index, and sum b_n converges, then sum a_n converges. Here, a_n = |(n-1)/(n^3 +1)| and b_n = 1/n².

But is (n-1)/(n^3 +1) ≤ 1/n² for all n sufficiently large? Let's see:

(n-1)/(n^3 +1) ≤ 1/n² ?

Multiply both sides by n^3 +1 (which is positive for n ≥1):

n - 1 ≤ (n^3 +1)/n² → n -1 ≤ n + 1/n².

Simplify: n -1 ≤ n + 1/n² → subtract n: -1 ≤ 1/n². Which is always true because 1/n² is positive. So yes, the inequality holds for all n ≥1. So the comparison test applies, and since sum 1/n² converges, our series converges absolutely.

Wait, but the original series includes negative terms too. But absolute convergence implies that the series converges regardless of the sign of the terms. So the series converges.

Wait, but looking back at the options: the options are numbers and "The series diverges". The options don't include "converges"; instead, they have numbers like 0.5, 1.0, etc. Wait, no, the options are A: 2.5, B:0.5, ..., C: diverges, etc. So perhaps the question is actually about the sum converging to a particular value, not just whether it converges or diverges.

Wait, but the original question says, "Does the following series converge?" So it's a yes/no question. But the options include "The series diverges" as option C, and other options are numbers. That's confusing because the sum might converge to a specific value. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is whether the series converges (i.e., whether it converges or diverges), and the options are the possible conclusions. So the options are: A-J are numbers, C says diverges, others are numbers. So the possible answers are either a specific value or that it diverges.

Wait, but the series is sum_{n=0}^infty (n-1)/(n^3+1). Let me compute a few partial sums to see if I can get an idea.

n=0: -1
n=1: -1 + 0 = -1
n=2: -1 + 0 + 1/9 ≈ -1 + 0.111 ≈ -0.889
n=3: add 2/28 ≈ 0.071 → ≈ -0.818
n=4: add 3/65 ≈ 0.046 → ≈ -0.772
n=5: (5-1)/(125+1)=4/126≈0.0317 → sum ≈-0.740
n=6: 5/(216+1)=5/217≈0.023 → sum≈-0.717
n=7:6/(343+1)=6/344≈0.0174→ sum≈-0.699
n=8:7/513≈0.0136→ sum≈-0.685
n=9:8/730≈0.0109→ sum≈-0.674
n=10:9/1001≈0.009→ sum≈-0.665.

It's getting closer to a value around -0.66 or so, but it's negative. Wait, but earlier analysis suggested it converges, so maybe the sum converges to a negative value around -0.66 or similar. But the options don't have that. Let me check the options again.

Options are:

A: 2.5

B:0.5

C:The series diverges

D:0

E:1.5

F:0.25

G:2.0

H:0.75

I:1.0

J:3.0

So none of the options are negative, except perhaps if I made a mistake in the partial sums. Wait, perhaps the series converges conditionally or absolutely, but the sum is a positive number. Wait, maybe I should compute the sum more accurately.

Wait, but perhaps I should find the exact sum. Let's try to compute the sum.

Sum from n=0 to ∞ of (n-1)/(n^3+1).

Wait, n=0 term is (0-1)/(0+1) = -1.

n=1: (1-1)/(1+1)=0.

n=2:1/(8+1)=1/9.

n=3:2/(27+1)=2/28=1/14.

n=4:3/(64+1)=3/65.

n=5:4/(125+1)=4/126=2/63.

n=6:5/(216+1)=5/217.

n=7:6/(343+1)=6/344=3/172.

n=8:7/(512+1)=7/513.

n=9:8/(729+1)=8/730.

n=10:9/(1000+1)=9/1001.

Hmm, adding these up, but it's tedious. Alternatively, perhaps we can find a general expression for the sum.

Alternatively, perhaps the series can be expressed as the sum from n=0 to ∞ of (n-1)/(n^3+1). Let me see if I can factor the denominator.

n^3 +1 = (n+1)(n² -n +1). So the denominator factors into (n+1)(n² -n +1).

So, (n-1)/(n^3+1) = (n-1)/[(n+1)(n² -n +1)].

Perhaps partial fraction decomposition could help here. Let me try to express (n-1)/[(n+1)(n² -n +1)] as A/(n+1) + (Bn + C)/(n² -n +1).

So, set up:

(n-1) = A(n² -n +1) + (Bn + C)(n+1).

Expanding the right side:

A(n² -n +1) + Bn(n+1) + C(n+1)

= A n² - A n + A + B n² + B n + C n + C.

Combine like terms:

(A + B) n² + (-A + B + C) n + (A + C).

Set equal to left side: n -1 = (n-1) → 0n² +1n -1.

So, equating coefficients:

A + B = 0 (coefficient of n²)

-A + B + C = 1 (coefficient of n)

A + C = -1 (constant term)

Now, we have a system of equations:

1. A + B = 0 → B = -A.

2. -A + B + C = 1.

Substitute B = -A into equation 2:

-A + (-A) + C = 1 → -2A + C = 1.

3. A + C = -1.

Now, from equation 3: C = -1 - A.

Substitute into equation 2:

-2A + (-1 - A) = 1 → -3A -1 =1 → -3A=2 → A= -2/3.

Then B = -A = 2/3.

From equation 3: C = -1 - (-2/3) = -1 + 2/3 = -1/3.

So the partial fractions are:

(-2/3)/(n+1) + ( (2/3)n -1/3 )/(n² -n +1).

Wait, let me double-check:

Yes, A=-2/3, B=2/3, C=-1/3.

So, the decomposition is:

(n-1)/(n^3 +1) = (-2/3)/(n+1) + ( (2/3 n - 1/3 ) )/(n² -n +1).

Simplify this:

= (-2)/(3(n+1)) + (2n -1)/(3(n² -n +1)).

Now, the sum from n=0 to ∞ can be split into two sums:

Sum [ (-2)/(3(n+1)) ] + Sum [ (2n -1)/(3(n² -n +1)) ].

Let me handle each sum separately.

First sum: (-2/3) Sum [1/(n+1)] from n=0 to ∞.

But Sum [1/(n+1)] from n=0 is the harmonic series, which diverges. So the first sum is (-2/3) times the harmonic series, which diverges.

Wait, but the original series is supposed to converge according to the comparison test earlier. Hmm, that's a contradiction. What's wrong here?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the partial fractions. Let me check the decomposition again.

Wait, when I set up the partial fractions, I assumed (n-1) = A(n² -n +1) + (Bn + C)(n+1).

Let me recompute:

A(n^2 -n +1) + (Bn + C)(n+1) = A n² - A n + A + Bn(n+1) + C(n+1).

= A n² -A n + A + B n² + Bn + C n + C.

Combine terms:

(A + B)n² + (-A + B + C) n + (A + C).

Set equal to (n-1) = 0 n² +1 n -1.

So:

A + B = 0

-A + B + C = 1

A + C = -1.

Solving:

From first equation: B = -A.

Substitute into second equation:

-A + (-A) + C = 1 → -2A + C =1.

Third equation: C = -1 - A.

Substitute into second equation:

-2A + (-1 - A) =1 → -3A -1 =1 → -3A=2 → A= -2/3.

So B=2/3, C= -1 - (-2/3) = -1 + 2/3 = -1/3.

So that part is correct.

Hmm, but then the first sum is (-2/3) Sum [1/(n+1)] from n=0, which is (-2/3) times the harmonic series starting at n=1: sum from n=1 of 1/n. So that diverges.

But the original series converges, so there must be some cancellation happening in the second sum that causes the divergences to cancel.

So, let's look at the second sum: Sum [ (2n -1)/(3(n² -n +1)) ].

Let me see if this sum converges or diverges.

First, for large n, the term behaves like (2n)/(n²) = 2/n, which is similar to the harmonic series, which diverges. So if the second sum diverges, and the first sum is divergent, but their combination might converge if they diverge in opposite directions.

Wait, but I thought earlier that the series converges absolutely because |(n-1)/(n^3+1)| ≤ 1/n², which converges. So perhaps the second sum converges conditionally.

Wait, perhaps I should analyze the second sum more carefully.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a telescoping nature in the partial fractions.

Let me write the second term as (2n -1)/(3(n² -n +1)).

Hmm, maybe I can express this as a derivative or find a telescoping pattern.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write it as a difference of terms.

Wait, let's consider the denominator: n² -n +1. Let me see what happens when I look at consecutive terms.

Suppose I let m = n-1, then for n, the denominator is n² -n +1 = (n-0.5)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2, but that might not help.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write (2n -1) as 2(n) -1, which is similar to the derivative of the denominator.

Wait, the derivative of n² -n +1 is 2n -1. Oh! That's exactly the numerator. So, that suggests that (2n -1)/(n² -n +1) is the derivative over the function, which is the derivative of the denominator.

Which means that the integral of (2n -1)/(n² -n +1) dn is ln|n² -n +1| + C.

But wait, how does that help with the sum?

Hmm, perhaps it's telescoping when considering the difference between terms, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can express it as a telescoping series.

Wait, perhaps if I consider the term (2n -1)/(3(n² -n +1)) as a difference between 1/(3(n)) and 1/(3(n-1)), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express it as the difference of two fractions. Let me try to write it as A/(n) + B/(n-1).

Wait, let's think differently. Since the denominator is n² -n +1, which is (n)(n-1) +1, perhaps I can find a way to write the fraction as a telescoping difference.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write (2n -1)/(n² -n +1) as [ (n+1) - (n) ] / (n² -n +1). Wait, not sure.

Wait, perhaps I can write (2n -1) as (n+1) + (n-2), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can split it into terms that can telescope.

Wait, maybe I can write (2n -1)/(n² -n +1) = [ (n+1) - (n-2) ] / (n² -n +1). Hmm, not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write (2n -1) as (n+1) + (n-2), but that might not help either.

Wait, perhaps I can split the fraction into two parts: A/(n) + B/(n-1), but I'm not sure. Let me try:

Let me assume (2n -1)/(n² -n +1) = A/n + B/(n-1). Then,

(2n -1) = A(n-1) + Bn.

Expanding: 2n -1 = A n - A + B n.

Grouping terms: (A + B) n + (-A) = 2n -1.

So,

A + B = 2,

-A = -1 → A =1.

Then, B = 2 - A =1.

So, (2n -1)/(n² -n +1) = 1/n + 1/(n-1).

Wait, but that can't be right because when I combine 1/n +1/(n-1) = (2n -1)/(n(n-1)).

Wait, but the denominator here is n² -n +1, not n(n-1). So that approach doesn't work. Therefore, perhaps this method isn't applicable.

Hmm, maybe I should consider that the partial fraction decomposition leads to a telescoping series when considering the entire expression.

So, the original decomposition is:

(n-1)/(n^3 +1) = (-2/3)/(n+1) + (2n -1)/(3(n² -n +1)).

So, when we sum from n=0 to ∞, the first term is (-2/3) sum 1/(n+1) which is (-2/3) times the harmonic series, which diverges.

The second term is (1/3) sum (2n -1)/(n² -n +1). Let's analyze this sum.

As I noted earlier, the term (2n -1)/(n² -n +1) behaves like 2n /n² = 2/n for large n, which diverges when summed. But perhaps the two divergent sums cancel each other out.

Wait, let me think. The first sum is (-2/3) sum 1/(n+1) from n=0, which is (-2/3) times [1 + 1/2 +1/3 +1/4 + ...].

The second sum is (1/3) sum (2n -1)/(n² -n +1).

But let's see if we can express (2n -1)/(n² -n +1) as a telescoping difference.

Wait, perhaps (2n -1)/(n² -n +1) = [something] - [something else].

Wait, let me consider that the derivative of the denominator is 2n -1, which is exactly the numerator. So, the integral of (2n -1)/(n² -n +1) dn is ln|n² -n +1| + C.

But for the sum, perhaps the terms can be expressed as differences of logs, leading to a telescoping effect.

Let me write S = sum_{n=0}^infty (2n -1)/(3(n² -n +1)).

So, S = (1/3) sum_{n=0}^\infty (2n -1)/(n² -n +1).

Let me compute the first few terms to see if there's a pattern.

n=0: (2*0 -1)/(0 -0 +1) = (-1)/1 = -1.

n=1: (2*1 -1)/(1 -1 +1)=1/1=1.

n=2: (4-1)/(4-2+1)=3/3=1.

n=3: (6-1)/(9-3+1)=5/7≈0.714.

n=4:7/(16-4+1)=7/13≈0.538.

n=5:9/(25-5+1)=9/21=3/7≈0.428.

n=6:11/(36-6+1)=11/31≈0.354.

n=7:13/(49-7+1)=13/43≈0.302.

n=8:15/(64-8+1)=15/57≈0.263.

n=9:17/(81-9+1)=17/73≈0.233.

n=10:19/(100-10+1)=19/91≈0.209.

Hmm, the terms are positive after n=1, and decreasing. Let me see if there's a telescoping pattern.

Wait, perhaps I can write (2n -1)/(n² -n +1) as [something] - [something else].

Wait, let's consider that n² -n +1 = (n-1)^2 + (n-1) +1.

Wait, for n, the denominator is n² -n +1.

For n-1, it's (n-1)^2 - (n-1) +1 = n² - 2n +1 -n +1 +1 = n² -3n +3.

Hmm, not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps (2n -1)/(n² -n +1) = [something related to (n)] - [something related to (n-1)].

Let me assume that (2n -1)/(n² -n +1) = A/(n) - A/(n-1), where A is a constant to be determined.

So,

(2n -1)/(n² -n +1) = A/(n) - A/(n-1).

Multiply both sides by n(n-1)(n² -n +1):

(2n -1) n(n-1) = A (n-1)(n² -n +1) - A n(n² -n +1).

But this seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can find a telescoping pattern by considering the partial sums.

Let me compute the partial sum up to N:

Sum from n=0 to N of (2n -1)/(n² -n +1).

Looking at the first few terms:

n=0: -1

n=1:1

n=2:1

n=3:5/7≈0.714

n=4:7/13≈0.538

n=5:3/7≈0.428

So, the partial sum from n=0 to N is:

-1 +1 +1 +5/7 +7/13 +3/7 + ... 

Wait, perhaps the terms after n=2 start to cancel out. Let me see:

The sum up to n=2 is (-1) +1 +1 =1.

n=3:1 +5/7≈1.714.

n=4:1.714 +7/13≈1.714+0.538≈2.252.

n=5:2.252 +3/7≈2.252+0.428≈2.68.

n=6:2.68 +11/31≈2.68+0.354≈3.034.

n=7:3.034+13/43≈3.034+0.302≈3.336.

n=8:3.336+15/57≈3.336+0.263≈3.599.

n=9:3.599+17/73≈3.599+0.233≈3.832.

n=10:3.832+19/91≈3.832+0.209≈4.041.

Hmm, the partial sums are increasing, but perhaps approaching a limit. Wait, but earlier analysis suggested the series converges, so perhaps it converges to a finite value.

But I'm getting partial sums approaching around 4 or more, but that's just up to n=10. Maybe the sum converges to a larger value. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the partial fraction decomposition.

Wait, but earlier I found that the original series converges absolutely, so the sum should converge to a finite value. Let me try to compute the exact sum.

Wait, perhaps the sum can be expressed as a telescoping series. Let me think again.

From the partial fractions:

(n-1)/(n^3 +1) = (-2/3)/(n+1) + (2n-1)/(3(n² -n +1)).

So, the sum from n=0 to ∞ is:

Sum [ (-2/3)/(n+1) + (2n-1)/(3(n² -n +1)) ].

Let me separate this into two sums:

S = (-2/3) Sum_{n=0}^\infty 1/(n+1) + (1/3) Sum_{n=0}^\infty (2n-1)/(n² -n +1).

The first sum is (-2/3) times the harmonic series, which diverges to -infinity.

The second sum, as I saw earlier, seems to approach a finite value, but let's check if it diverges.

Wait, for large n, (2n -1)/(n² -n +1) ≈ 2n /n² = 2/n, which is similar to the harmonic series, which diverges. So the second sum also diverges to +infinity.

So, S = (-2/3)(∞) + (1/3)(∞) → which is (-∞) + (∞), which is indeterminate. So perhaps the divergences cancel out, leading to a finite sum.

To evaluate this, perhaps I can consider the partial sums up to N and see if the divergent parts cancel.

Let me denote S_N = sum_{n=0}^N [ (-2/3)/(n+1) + (2n-1)/(3(n² -n +1)) ].

= (-2/3) sum_{n=0}^N 1/(n+1) + (1/3) sum_{n=0}^N (2n-1)/(n² -n +1).

= (-2/3)(H_{N+1}) + (1/3) sum_{n=0}^N (2n-1)/(n² -n +1),

where H_{N} is the Nth harmonic number.

Now, let's look at the second sum. Let me denote it as T_N = sum_{n=0}^N (2n-1)/(n² -n +1).

I need to find a way to express T_N in terms that might cancel the harmonic series.

Wait, perhaps T_N can be expressed as a telescoping sum.

Let me consider that:

(2n -1)/(n² -n +1) = [f(n) - f(n-1)], where f(n) is some function.

Let me try to find f(n) such that f(n) - f(n-1) = (2n -1)/(n² -n +1).

Assume f(n) = ln(n² -n +1). Then,

f(n) - f(n-1) = ln(n² -n +1) - ln( (n-1)^2 - (n-1) +1 )

Simplify the denominator for n-1:

(n-1)^2 - (n-1) +1 = n² -2n +1 -n +1 +1 = n² -3n +3.

So,

f(n) - f(n-1) = ln( (n² -n +1)/(n² -3n +3) ).

But that's not equal to (2n -1)/(n² -n +1). So that approach doesn't directly work.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write (2n -1)/(n² -n +1) as the derivative of ln(n² -n +1), but that's for integrals, not sums.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find a telescoping pattern by considering the difference between terms.

Wait, perhaps I can write (2n -1)/(n² -n +1) = [something involving 1/(n)] - [something involving 1/(n-1)].

Let me try to assume that (2n -1)/(n² -n +1) = A/(n) - A/(n-1).

Then,

(2n -1) = A(n-1) - A n = A(n-1 -n) = A(-1).

So,

2n -1 = -A → A= (1 - 2n).

Wait, that doesn't make sense because A would depend on n, but we need A to be a constant. So this approach doesn't work.

Hmm, perhaps I need to abandon the partial fraction approach and think differently.

Wait, going back, the original series is sum_{n=0}^\infty (n-1)/(n^3 +1).

I can write this as sum_{n=0}^\infty (n-1)/(n^3 +1).

But perhaps for n >=1, the terms are (n-1)/(n^3 +1). For n=0, it's -1.

Let me consider the sum from n=1 to ∞. The term at n=0 is -1, and n=1 term is 0, so the sum from n=1 is the same as the sum from n=0 because adding 0 doesn't change it.

So, sum from n=1 to ∞ (n-1)/(n^3 +1).

Let me make a substitution: let k = n-1. Then, when n=1, k=0, and as n→∞, k→∞.

So, sum becomes sum_{k=0}^\infty k/( (k+1)^3 +1 ).

Hmm, not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write (n-1)/(n^3 +1) = (n-1)/(n^3 +1) = (n-1)/[(n+1)(n² -n +1)].

Wait, perhaps I can split this into two fractions:

(n-1)/[(n+1)(n² -n +1)] = A/(n+1) + (Bn + C)/(n² -n +1).

Wait, I think I did this earlier, leading to partial fractions with divergent sums. But perhaps when combined, the divergences cancel.

So, the sum S = sum_{n=0}^\infty [ (-2/3)/(n+1) + (2n -1)/(3(n² -n +1)) ].

Let me write S = (-2/3) sum_{n=0}^\infty 1/(n+1) + (1/3) sum_{n=0}^\infty (2n -1)/(n² -n +1).

As N approaches infinity, sum_{n=0}^N 1/(n+1) = H_{N+1} ~ ln(N+1) + γ, where γ is Euler-Mascheroni constant.

Similarly, sum_{n=0}^N (2n -1)/(n² -n +1) = sum_{n=0}^N [d/dn ln(n² -n +1)].

Wait, but that's for integrals, not sums. Alternatively, perhaps the sum T_N = sum_{n=0}^N (2n -1)/(n² -n +1).

Let me compute T_N:

T_N = sum_{n=0}^N (2n -1)/(n² -n +1).

Let me see if I can express this sum as a telescoping series.

Wait, perhaps I can write (2n -1)/(n² -n +1) = [something] - [something].

Let me try to find an expression where the terms cancel out.

Wait, let me compute T_N:

T_N = sum_{n=0}^N (2n -1)/(n² -n +1).

Let me compute the first few terms:

n=0: (-1)/1 = -1.

n=1:1/1=1.

n=2:3/3=1.

n=3:5/7≈0.714.

n=4:7/13≈0.538.

n=5:9/21=3/7≈0.428.

n=6:11/31≈0.354.

n=7:13/43≈0.302.

n=8:15/57≈0.263.

n=9:17/73≈0.233.

n=10:19/91≈0.209.

So T_N = (-1) +1 +1 +5/7 +7/13 +9/21 +11/31 +13/43 +15/57 +17/73 +19/91 + ... up to n=N.

Hmm, I don't see an obvious telescoping pattern here. Maybe I should try a different approach.

Wait, perhaps I can consider the sum from n=2 to ∞ of (n-1)/(n^3 +1). Let me make substitution m = n-1. Then n = m+1, and when n=2, m=1.

So sum from m=1 to ∞ of m / ( (m+1)^3 +1 ).

Hmm, not sure if that's helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compare the terms more directly.

Wait, but earlier I determined that the series converges absolutely because |(n-1)/(n^3 +1)| ≤ 1/n², and sum 1/n² converges. So the series converges.

But the options don't have "converges"; they have specific values and "diverges". So the correct answer must be that the series converges, but the options don't list that. Wait, looking back at the options:

Options are:

A: 2.5

B:0.5

C:The series diverges

D:0

E:1.5

F:0.25

G:2.0

H:0.75

I:1.0

J:3.0

So the options are either specific numbers or that it diverges. But the series converges, so the correct answer would be that it doesn't diverge, meaning the options are either a specific sum or C (diverges). But the series does converge, so the answer can't be C. Therefore, the correct choice must be one of the numbers, but earlier partial sums suggested it converges to around -0.66 or something, but none of the options match that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-examine the partial fraction decomposition.

Wait, when I did the partial fractions, I got:

(n-1)/(n^3 +1) = (-2/3)/(n+1) + (2n -1)/(3(n² -n +1)).

But when I sum from n=0 to ∞, the first term is (-2/3) sum 1/(n+1), which is (-2/3)(H_∞), which diverges to -∞.

The second sum is (1/3) sum (2n-1)/(n² -n +1). Let's see if this sum converges.

Wait, for large n, (2n -1)/(n² -n +1) ≈ 2n /n² = 2/n, which is similar to the harmonic series, which diverges. So the second sum also diverges to +∞.

So S = (-2/3)(∞) + (1/3)(∞) → which is an indeterminate form. So perhaps the divergences cancel, leading to a finite sum.

To find the exact sum, perhaps I can consider the partial sums up to N and see the limit as N approaches infinity.

Let me write S_N = sum_{n=0}^N [ (-2/3)/(n+1) + (2n-1)/(3(n² -n +1)) ].

= (-2/3) sum_{n=0}^N 1/(n+1) + (1/3) sum_{n=0}^N (2n-1)/(n² -n +1).

= (-2/3)(H_{N+1}) + (1/3) sum_{n=0}^N (2n-1)/(n² -n +1).

Now, let me denote T_N = sum_{n=0}^N (2n-1)/(n² -n +1).

I need to find T_N.

Wait, perhaps T_N can be expressed in terms of H_{N+1} or similar.

Wait, let me consider that the second sum, T_N, might be related to the harmonic series.

Let me compute T_N:

T_N = sum_{n=0}^N (2n-1)/(n² -n +1).

Let me try to write each term as a difference of reciprocals.

Wait, perhaps (2n -1)/(n² -n +1) = [1/(n)] - [1/(n-1)].

Wait, let's test for n=1:

(2*1 -1)/(1 -1 +1) =1/1=1.

[1/1] - [1/0] → undefined, so that's not possible.

Alternatively, perhaps (2n -1)/(n² -n +1) = [1/(n)] + [1/(n+1)].

Wait, for n=1: 1 = 1 +1/2= 3/2, which is not correct.

Hmm, perhaps another approach. Let me consider that the denominator n² -n +1 can be written as n(n-1) +1.

Wait, perhaps I can write (2n -1)/(n² -n +1) = A/n + B/(n-1).

But earlier that didn't work because it led to A + B =2 and -A =-1, so A=1, B=1, but then the denominator would be n(n-1), not n² -n +1.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write (2n -1)/(n² -n +1) = [ (n+1) - (n-2) ]/(n² -n +1), but I don't see how that helps.

Wait, perhaps I can write it as [ (n+1) + (n-2) ]/(n² -n +1), but that also doesn't seem helpful.

Another idea: Let me consider that n² -n +1 = (n-0.5)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2, which is a form that might relate to the sum of a series, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps integrating term by term, but that's for functions, not sums.

Wait, perhaps I can write the sum as a telescoping series by considering the difference between consecutive terms of some function.

Wait, let me think differently. Since the partial fraction decomposition leads to terms involving 1/(n+1) and (2n-1)/(n² -n +1), perhaps when combined, the divergent parts cancel.

Let me consider S = sum [ (-2)/(3(n+1)) + (2n-1)/(3(n² -n +1)) ].

Let me write the partial sum up to N:

S_N = (-2/3) sum_{n=0}^N 1/(n+1) + (1/3) sum_{n=0}^N (2n-1)/(n² -n +1).

= (-2/3)(H_{N+1}) + (1/3) T_N,

where T_N = sum_{n=0}^N (2n-1)/(n² -n +1).

I need to find T_N.

Wait, perhaps T_N can be expressed as a telescoping sum. Let me compute T_N:

T_N = sum_{n=0}^N (2n-1)/(n² -n +1).

Let me compute the first few terms:

n=0: (-1)/1 = -1.

n=1:1/1=1.

n=2:3/3=1.

n=3:5/7≈0.714.

n=4:7/13≈0.538.

n=5:9/21=3/7≈0.428.

n=6:11/31≈0.354.

n=7:13/43≈0.302.

n=8:15/57≈0.263.

n=9:17/73≈0.233.

n=10:19/91≈0.209.

Adding these up:

n=0: -1.

n=1: -1 +1 =0.

n=2:0 +1=1.

n=3:1 +5/7 ≈1.714.

n=4:1.714 +7/13≈1.714 +0.538≈2.252.

n=5:2.252 +3/7≈2.252+0.428≈2.68.

n=6:2.68 +11/31≈2.68+0.354≈3.034.

n=7:3.034 +13/43≈3.034+0.302≈3.336.

n=8:3.336 +15/57≈3.336+0.263≈3.599.

n=9:3.599 +17/73≈3.599+0.233≈3.832.

n=10:3.832 +19/91≈3.832+0.209≈4.041.

So T_N up to n=10 is approximately 4.041.

But I need a general expression for T_N.

Wait, perhaps I can note that the denominator for term n is n² -n +1, and for term n+1, it's (n+1)^2 - (n+1) +1 =n² +2n +1 -n -1 +1 =n² +n +1.

Wait, perhaps there's a relation between the denominators of consecutive terms. Let me see:

Denominator at n: D(n) =n² -n +1.

Denominator at n+1: D(n+1) = (n+1)^2 - (n+1) +1 =n² +2n +1 -n -1 +1 =n² +n +1.

Hmm, not sure if that helps.

Wait, perhaps I can write (2n-1)/(n² -n +1) = [something involving 1/(n)] - [something involving 1/(n-1)].

Wait, let me try to find constants A and B such that:

(2n -1)/(n² -n +1) = A/(n) - A/(n-1).

Then,

2n -1 = A(n-1) - A n = A(n-1 -n) = -A.

So,

2n -1 = -A → A = -(2n -1).

But A can't depend on n; it must be a constant. So this approach doesn't work.

Hmm, perhaps another approach is needed. Let me consider that the sum S is the sum from n=0 to ∞ of (n-1)/(n^3 +1).

But earlier, I established that the series converges absolutely, so the sum converges to a finite value. But the options don't include an option that says "converges"; instead, they have specific values and option C says it diverges.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the comparison test. Let me double-check.

I compared |(n-1)/(n^3 +1)| ≤ 1/n² for n ≥2.

But for n=2: |1/9| = 1/9 ≤ 1/4 → yes.

n=3: |2/28|=1/14 ≤1/9 → yes.

n=4:3/65 ≤1/16 → 3/65 ≈0.046 ≤0.0625 → yes.

As n increases, |(n-1)/(n^3 +1)| ~1/n², which is dominated by 1/n², whose sum converges.

Therefore, by the Comparison Test, the series converges absolutely.

So the series converges, and the only options are specific numbers or that it diverges. Since it converges, the correct answer is not C. But the options don't include a "converges" option, so perhaps the intended answer is that it diverges, but that's incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the partial fraction decomposition. Let me check again.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the exact sum using the partial fractions.

The partial fraction decomposition is:

(n-1)/(n^3+1) = (-2)/(3(n+1)) + (2n -1)/(3(n² -n +1)).

So, the sum S = sum_{n=0}^\infty [ (-2)/(3(n+1)) + (2n -1)/(3(n² -n +1)) ].

Let me separate the sums:

S = (-2/3) sum_{n=0}^\infty 1/(n+1) + (1/3) sum_{n=0}^\infty (2n -1)/(n² -n +1).

As established, both sums diverge, but perhaps their combination converges.

Let me consider the partial sums up to N:

S_N = (-2/3) sum_{n=0}^N 1/(n+1) + (1/3) sum_{n=0}^N (2n -1)/(n² -n +1).

= (-2/3)(H_{N+1}) + (1/3) T_N,

where T_N = sum_{n=0}^N (2n -1)/(n² -n +1).

I need to find the limit as N→∞ of S_N.

Let me compute T_N for large N.

For large n, (2n -1)/(n² -n +1) ≈ 2n /n² = 2/n.

So, T_N ≈ sum_{n=0}^N 2/n.

But sum_{n=0}^N 2/n = 2 H_{N+1}.

So, T_N ≈ 2 H_{N+1}.

Now, substituting back into S_N:

S_N ≈ (-2/3) H_{N+1} + (1/3)(2 H_{N+1}) ) = (-2/3 + 2/3) H_{N+1} = 0.

But this is just an approximation. The actual terms might cancel more precisely.

Wait, perhaps I can write T_N = 2 H_{N+1} - C, where C is some constant.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the exact sum can be found by evaluating the limit.

Wait, let me consider the partial sum S_N:

S_N = (-2/3) H_{N+1} + (1/3) T_N.

If T_N = 2 H_{N+1} - K, where K is a constant, then:

S_N = (-2/3) H_{N+1} + (1/3)(2 H_{N+1} - K) ) = (-2/3 + 2/3) H_{N+1} - (1/3) K = - (1/3) K.

So, if T_N = 2 H_{N+1} - K, then S_N = -K/3.

But I need to find K.

Wait, perhaps I can compute T_N for small N and see a pattern.

Let me compute T_N for N=0: T_0 = (-1)/1 = -1.

N=1: T_1 = -1 +1=0.

N=2: T_2=0+1=1.

N=3:1 +5/7≈1.714.

N=4:1.714 +7/13≈2.252.

But for N=0, T_0 = -1.

If T_N = 2 H_{N+1} - K,

At N=0: T_0 = 2 H_1 - K → -1 = 2(1) - K → K=3.

So, K=3.

Thus, T_N = 2 H_{N+1} -3.

Then,

S_N = (-2/3) H_{N+1} + (1/3)(2 H_{N+1} -3 ) = (-2/3) H_{N+1} + (2/3 H_{N+1} -1 ) = (-2/3 + 2/3) H_{N+1} -1 = -1.

So, as N→∞, S_N approaches -1.

Therefore, the sum converges to -1.

Wait, that's a specific value. So the sum is -1.

But looking back at the options, the options are positive numbers and "diverges". The sum is negative, but perhaps the question is about the absolute convergence, but the options don't include negative numbers. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, according to this, S_N approaches -1, so the sum converges to -1.

But the options don't include -1. The closest is option D:0, but that's not correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the partial fraction decomposition leading to T_N =2 H_{N+1} -3.

Let me check for N=0:

T_0 = (-1)/1 = -1.

According to T_N =2 H_{N+1} -3,

For N=0: 2 H_1 -3 =2(1) -3= -1. Correct.

For N=1: T_1= (-1)+1=0.

2 H_2 -3=2(1 +1/2) -3=2(3/2) -3=3-3=0. Correct.

For N=2: T_2=0 +1=1.

2 H_3 -3=2(1 +1/2 +1/3) -3=2(11/6) -3=11/3 -3= (11-9)/3=2/3≈0.666. But T_2 is 1. So this doesn't match.

Wait, so my assumption that T_N=2 H_{N+1} -3 is incorrect beyond N=1.

Hmm, this suggests that the earlier approach has a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps the partial fraction approach isn't the best way to find the exact sum.

Given the time I've spent and the confusion, perhaps the correct answer is that the series converges, but none of the options except C (diverges) are incorrect. But earlier analysis using the comparison test shows it converges, so the correct answer must be that it converges, but the options don't include that. Alternatively, perhaps the intended answer is that it converges, but the options don't have that, so perhaps the closest is option C: The series diverges, which would be incorrect.

Wait, but according to my partial fraction decomposition and the limit as N approaches infinity, S_N approaches -1, which is a finite value, so the series converges.

But the options don't include -1, so perhaps the intended answer is that it converges, but the options don't reflect that. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the partial fractions.

Wait, perhaps I should accept that the series converges, and the correct answer is not C. But among the options, the only correct conclusion is that it converges, but the options don't have that. Therefore, perhaps the intended answer is that it converges, but since the options don't have that, perhaps the correct choice is I:1.0, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the sum is 1, but according to my earlier partial sums, it's approaching around -0.66, which isn't matching any options.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the sum from n=0 to ∞ of (n-1)/(n^3 +1) is equal to -1, based on the partial fractions and the limit as N approaches infinity.

Thus, the sum converges to -1, but since the options don't include negative numbers, perhaps the intended answer is that it converges, but none of the options reflect that. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option I:1.0, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the partial fraction decomposition. Let me re-express the partial fractions:

(n-1)/(n^3 +1) = (-2/3)/(n+1) + (2n-1)/(3(n² -n +1)).

Now, let me sum from n=1 to ∞, since n=0 gives 0 in the second term.

Sum from n=1 to ∞:

= (-2/3) sum_{n=1}^\infty 1/(n+1) + (1/3) sum_{n=1}^\infty (2n-1)/(n² -n +1).

Let me shift index in the first sum: let m =n+1 → n =m-1.

So, sum_{n=1}^\infty 1/(n+1) = sum_{m=2}^\infty 1/m = H_∞ -1 -1/2.

Similarly, the second sum can be expressed as sum_{n=1}^\infty (2n-1)/(n² -n +1).

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the exact sum is -1, as calculated earlier, but the options don't include that. Therefore, the correct answer must be that the series converges, but since the options don't include that, perhaps the intended answer is option C: The series diverges, which is incorrect based on the comparison test.
</think>

The series $\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{n-1}{n^3+1}$ is analyzed for convergence. By applying the comparison test, it is shown that the series converges absolutely since the terms are bounded by $1/n^2$, whose sum converges. However, when considering the partial fraction decomposition and partial sums, the series appears to converge to a specific value, though the options provided do not include negative values or a direct "converges" option. Despite the analysis suggesting convergence, the options force a choice between specific values or divergence. Based on the comparison test, the series converges, but the options do not reflect this accurately. The closest option to the conclusion is **I: 1.0**, though this does not align with the detailed partial sum calculations.

ANSWER: I
