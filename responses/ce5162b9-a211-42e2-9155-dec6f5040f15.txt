Question:

The drag of a ship in water is assumed to depend on the Reynolds number and the Froude number so that [drag / {(1/2)(\rhoV^2A)}] = f [{(\rhoVD) / \mu}, (V^2 / gD)] It is proposed that a model one-tenth the size of a full-scale ship be tested in water and the results be used to predict the performance of the full-scale ship. Is this feasible?

Options:

A: both Froude and Reynolds numbers need to be greater in the prototype
B: only Weber numbers need to be equal for model and prototype
C: the attainment of dynamic similarity in model and prototype is not possible
D: both Froude and Reynolds numbers need to be smaller in the model
E: similitude can be achieved by matching the Euler numbers only
F: the attainment of dynamic similarity in model and prototype is possible
G: dynamic similarity is irrelevant for predicting performance
H: the attainment of geometric similarity in model and prototype is sufficient
I: only Reynolds numbers need to be equal for model and prototype
J: only Froude numbers need to be equal for model and prototype

Okay, so I've got this question about ship drag and model testing. Hmm, let's try to break it down.

The question says that the drag of a ship in water depends on the Reynolds number and the Froude number. The equation given is [drag / (½ ρ V² A)] = f [(ρ V D / μ), (V² / g D)]. So, they're expressing the dimensionless drag as a function of Reynolds number (Re) and Froude number (Fr).

Now, the problem is about testing a model that's one-tenth the size of the full-scale ship. I need to determine if this is feasible for predicting the full-scale performance. The options are from A to J, and I need to pick the correct one.

First, I remember that when scaling models, dynamic similarity is key. Dynamic similarity means that the model and prototype must have the same dimensionless numbers, like Re, Fr, etc., so that the flow patterns and forces are similar.

The model is 1/10th the size, so the linear scale factor is L = 1/10. To maintain dynamic similarity, the Reynolds number and Froude number must be the same for both model and prototype.

Reynolds number Re = (ρ V L) / μ. If the model is scaled down, to keep Re the same, either the velocity must increase or the viscosity must decrease. But since we can't change the viscosity (assuming same fluid), we have to adjust the velocity. So model velocity V_model = V_prototype * (L / 1) )? Wait, no, because Re must be equal. So Re_model = Re_prototype → (ρ V_model L_model) / μ = (ρ V_prototype L_prototype) / μ → V_model = V_prototype * (L_prototype / L_model). Since L_prototype is 10 times L_model, V_model = 10 * V_prototype. That seems high, but maybe possible.

Froude number Fr = V² / (g D), where D is the characteristic length, which would be the ship's length. So Fr_model = V_model²/(g L_model) and Fr_prototype = V_prototype²/(g L_prototype). For Fr to be equal, V_model²/(L_model) = V_prototype²/(L_prototype). Substituting L_prototype = 10 L_model, we get V_model² / L_model = V_prototype² / (10 L_model) → V_model² = (V_prototype²) / 10 → V_model = V_prototype / sqrt(10). Wait, that's conflicting with the Re requirement.

Wait, this is a problem. Because from Re, V_model needs to be 10 times higher, but from Fr, V_model needs to be V_prototype / sqrt(10), which is lower. These two can't both be true unless V_model is both higher and lower, which is impossible. So that means we can't have both Re and Fr equal simultaneously. Therefore, dynamic similarity isn't possible because we can't satisfy both conditions at the same time.

Looking at the options, option C says "the attainment of dynamic similarity in model and prototype is not possible." That makes sense because Re and Fr can't both be matched when scaling down the model by a factor of 1/10. Alternatively, if you ignore one, you might match the other, but not both.

Wait, but wait. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculations. Let me double-check.

Reynolds number scaling:
Re_model = Re_prototype → (V_model * L_model) = (V_prototype * L_prototype)
Since L_prototype = 10 L_model, then V_model = 10 V_prototype.

Froude number scaling:
Fr_model = Fr_prototype → (V_model² / L_model) = (V_prototype² / L_prototype)
Substituting L_prototype =10 L_model:
V_model² / L_model = V_prototype² / (10 L_model)
Multiply both sides by L_model:
V_model² = V_prototype² /10 → V_model = V_prototype / sqrt(10) ≈ 0.316 V_prototype.

So the model's velocity needs to be both 10 times higher (for Re) and 0.316 times lower (for Fr). That's a contradiction. Therefore, you can't have both Re and Fr the same, so dynamic similarity isn't achievable. So the model can't be dynamically similar to the prototype.

Thus, the answer must be C: the attainment of dynamic similarity is not possible.

The question involves determining whether a model ship, one-tenth the size of a full-scale ship, can be used to predict the full-scale performance while maintaining dynamic similarity. Dynamic similarity requires that both the Reynolds number (Re) and Froude number (Fr) remain the same for both the model and the prototype.

For Reynolds number similarity:
\[
\text{Re}_\text{model} = \text{Re}_\text{prototype} \implies \frac{\rho V_\text{model} L_\text{model}}{\mu} = \frac{\rho V_\text{prototype} L_\text{prototype}}{\mu}
\]
Given \( L_\text{prototype} = 10 L_\text{model} \), this implies:
\[
V_\text{model} = 10 V_\text{prototype}
\]

For Froude number similarity:
\[
\text{Fr}_\text{model} = \text{Fr}_\text{prototype} \implies \frac{V_\text{model}^2}{L_\text{model}} = \frac{V_\text{prototype}^2}{L_\text{prototype}}
\]
Substituting \( L_\text{prototype} = 10 L_\text{model} \), this implies:
\[
\frac{V_\text{model}^2}{L_\text{model}} = \frac{V_\text{prototype}^2}{10 L_\text{model}} \implies V_\text{model}^2 = \frac{V_\text{prototype}^2}{10} \implies V_\text{model} = \frac{V_\text{prototype}}{\sqrt{10}}
\]

These two conditions contradict each other: \( V_\text{model} \) must be both 10 times higher (for Re) and 0.316 times lower (for Fr). Therefore, dynamic similarity cannot be achieved simultaneously for both the Reynolds and Froude numbers when scaling the model by a factor of 1/10.

Thus, the correct answer is:

C: the attainment of dynamic similarity in model and prototype is not possible.
