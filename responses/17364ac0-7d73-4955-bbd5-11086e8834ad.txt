Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says: A car is moving with speed v and reaches the foot of an incline of angle θ. It coasts up the incline without using the engine. We're told to neglect friction and air resistance. The question is about the magnitude of the car's horizontal acceleration (ax) and vertical acceleration (ay). We have to choose the correct option from A to J.

Hmm, right. So, when the car is moving up the incline, it's no longer being powered by the engine, so the only forces acting on it are gravity and the normal force from the incline. Since we're neglecting friction and air resistance, those are the only two forces.

First, I need to break down the forces into their components. Let me visualize this. The incline makes an angle θ with the horizontal. The car is moving along this incline, so the direction of motion is up the incline.

The gravitational force (mg) acts vertically downward. When we resolve this into components along the incline (which I'll call the x-direction) and perpendicular to it (the y-direction), the components will be:

- Along the incline (x): mg sinθ
- Perpendicular to the incline (y): mg cosθ

Wait, but since the car is moving up the incline, the acceleration will be in the opposite direction of motion. Oh wait, no. Wait, the car is moving up, but the net force is down the incline because gravity is pulling it down. So the acceleration along the incline (ax_dir) will be opposite to the direction of motion, causing deceleration. But in terms of magnitude, the acceleration component along the incline would be a = g sinθ. But wait, that's the acceleration along the incline. But we're asked for the horizontal and vertical components of the acceleration.

So, I think I need to express the acceleration in terms of horizontal (x-axis) and vertical (y-axis) components, not along the incline.

Right. So, the net force on the car is the component of gravity along the incline, which is mg sinθ, acting down the incline. Since the car is moving up the incline, this force will cause a deceleration. The acceleration along the incline (a_incline) is a = -g sinθ (negative because it's opposite to the direction of motion).

But wait, we're to find the horizontal and vertical accelerations. So, how do these relate to a_incline?

Hmm. Let me think. The acceleration along the incline is a_incline = -g sinθ. But the car's acceleration can also be decomposed into horizontal (ax) and vertical (ay) components.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to consider the direction of acceleration. The acceleration is along the incline, but at an angle θ below the horizontal. Because the net force is down the incline, which is at an angle θ below the horizontal when looking from the car's perspective, which is moving up.

So, the acceleration vector points down the incline, which is at angle θ below the horizontal. Therefore, the horizontal component ax is the acceleration along the incline multiplied by cosθ, and the vertical component ay is the acceleration along the incline multiplied by sinθ.

Wait, no. Wait, the acceleration is along the incline, which is at an angle θ from the horizontal. So, to get the horizontal component, I can think of the acceleration vector as having components ax and ay such that ax is adjacent to angle θ, and ay is opposite.

So, ax = a_incline * cosθ, and ay = a_incline * sinθ.

But wait, a_incline is negative (since it's down the incline, opposite to the direction of motion), so ax would be negative (opposite to the horizontal direction) and ay would be negative (downward).

Wait, but the problem is asking about the magnitudes of ax and ay, so the signs don't matter here. We just need to compare their magnitudes to g.

So, a_incline is g sinθ, but directed down the incline. So, the magnitude of a_incline is g sinθ.

Then, the horizontal acceleration ax is a_incline * cosθ, and the vertical acceleration ay is a_incline * sinθ.

So, substituting, ax = (g sinθ) * cosθ = g sinθ cosθ.

And ay = (g sinθ) * sinθ = g sin²θ.

Now, since θ is an angle between 0 and 90 degrees (as it's an incline), sinθ is less than 1, so sin²θ < sinθ and sinθ cosθ < sinθ.

Wait, but let's think about the maximum possible values. For any θ between 0 and 90 degrees, sinθ is between 0 and 1. So, sin²θ is less than sinθ because sinθ <1, so multiplying by another sinθ makes it smaller. Similarly, sinθ cosθ is less than sinθ because cosθ is less than 1.

Wait, but wait, let's think about specific values. For example, when θ is 0 degrees (flat ground), sinθ is 0, so both ax and ay are 0, which makes sense because the car would just coast at constant speed with no acceleration.

When θ is 90 degrees (vertical incline, like a cliff), sinθ is 1, so a_incline is g. Then, ax would be g * 1 * 0 = 0, and ay would be g * 1^2 = g. So, in that case, ax is 0 and ay is g.

Wait, but that's only when θ is 90 degrees. But the problem says it's an incline, so θ is less than 90 degrees.

Wait, but in the general case where θ is between 0 and 90 degrees, let's compare ax and ay with g.

So, ax = g sinθ cosθ = (g/2) sin(2θ). The maximum value of sin(2θ) is 1 (at θ=45 degrees), so ax can be up to g/2. So, ax < g because g/2 is less than g.

Similarly, ay = g sin²θ. The maximum value of sin²θ is 1 (at θ=90 degrees), so ay can be up to g, but for θ <90, it's less than g.

Wait, but when θ approaches 90 degrees, ay approaches g. So, in all cases except θ=90, ay is less than g.

Wait, but when θ is 90 degrees, the problem is about a vertical incline, which might not be the case here. The problem states it's an incline, so θ is probably less than 90 degrees, making ay < g.

Wait a second. Wait, I think I made a mistake. Because when the car is moving up the incline, the acceleration is directed down the incline, which is at an angle θ from the horizontal. So, the vertical component of acceleration is the component of a_incline downward. So, ay is positive if it's downward, but in terms of magnitude, it's just the component.

But when I calculated ay as g sin²θ, and ax as g sinθ cosθ, both are less than g because sinθ and cosθ are each less than 1. So, both ax and ay are less than g.

Wait, but wait. Wait, let's think again about the direction of the acceleration. The car is moving up the incline, so the net acceleration is down the incline, which is at angle θ below the horizontal. So, the horizontal component is ax = a_incline * cosθ, and the vertical component is ay = a_incline * sinθ.

But a_incline is g sinθ, so ax = g sinθ cosθ, ay = g sin²θ.

So, ax = (g/2) sin(2θ), which has a maximum of g/2, so ax < g.

And ay = g sin²θ, which has a maximum of g (at θ=90), but for any θ <90, ay is less than g.

Wait, but for θ=90, the car is moving vertically upward, but that's not an incline, that's a vertical surface. Since it's an incline, θ is less than 90, so ay < g.

So, both ax and ay are less than g in magnitude.

Wait, but let's look at the options. The options are:

Option B: ax =0, ay <g.

Option C: ax <g, ay <g.

Option E: ax=0, ay=g.

Wait, but according to our calculation, ax is g sinθ cosθ, which is not zero unless sinθ is zero (θ=0, flat ground), which is not the case here because it's an incline.

Wait, maybe I'm making a mistake in the component analysis.

Alternative approach: Let's model the coordinate system. Let's take the x-axis as horizontal and the y-axis as vertical.

The net force on the car is the component of gravity along the incline, which is mg sinθ, acting down the incline. The direction of this force is along the incline, which makes an angle θ above the negative x-axis (since the incline is upwards, but the force is down the incline, so from the top of the incline, the direction is down and to the left if the car is moving up to the right).

Wait, no. Let me think again. If the car is moving up the incline, which is inclined at θ above the horizontal, then the force of gravity has a component down the incline. So, in terms of the coordinate system, the gravitational component along the incline is mg sinθ, and the direction is along the negative x' direction, where x' is along the incline.

But to find the horizontal and vertical components, I need to express this force in the original x-y axes.

So, the gravitational component along the incline is F = mg sinθ, directed down the incline. The direction of this force relative to the x-y axes is θ degrees below the negative x-axis. Because the incline is at θ above the x-axis, so the force down the incline is θ below the negative x-axis.

So, the horizontal component (F_x) of this force is F * cosθ, but directed in the negative x direction.

Similarly, the vertical component (F_y) is F * sinθ, directed downward.

So, F_x = -mg sinθ cosθ.

F_y = -mg sin²θ.

Then, using Newton's second law, F = ma.

So, the acceleration components are:

a_x = F_x / m = (-mg sinθ cosθ)/m = -g sinθ cosθ.

Similarly, a_y = F_y / m = (-mg sin²θ)/m = -g sin²θ.

The magnitudes are |a_x| = g sinθ cosθ, and |a_y|= g sin²θ.

Now, which is larger: g sinθ cosθ or g sin²θ?

Well, it depends on θ. Let's see:

We can compare sinθ cosθ and sin²θ.

Let me compute for θ=30 degrees.

sin(30)=0.5, cos(30)=√3/2 ≈0.866.

So, sinθ cosθ = 0.5 * 0.866 ≈0.433.

sin²θ=0.25.

So, in this case, sinθ cosθ > sin²θ.

Thus, |a_x| =0.433 g, |a_y|=0.25 g. So, |a_x| > |a_y|.

Wait, but for θ=60 degrees:

sin(60)=√3/2≈0.866, cos(60)=0.5.

sinθ cosθ=0.866 *0.5≈0.433.

sin²θ= (0.866)^2≈0.75.

So, now |a_x|=0.433 g, |a_y|=0.75 g. So, here |a_y|>|a_x|.

Hmm, interesting. So, depending on θ, either a_x or a_y could be larger. But in both cases, they are less than g.

Wait, but the problem is asking about the magnitude of ax and ay in general. So, the correct option would have both ax and ay less than g.

Looking back at the options, option C is ax <g, ay <g.

Wait, but let me check for θ=0, which is a flat road. In that case, sinθ=0, so ax=0, ay=0. So, both are zero, which is less than g.

At θ approaching 90 degrees, sinθ approaches 1, so ax approaches g * 1 * 0 =0, and ay approaches g *1^2= g. But since the incline is less than 90 degrees, ay is less than g.

Wait, no. Wait, when θ approaches 90 degrees, the incline becomes almost vertical. So, the car is moving up almost vertically, and the acceleration is down the incline, which is almost vertical. So, the vertical acceleration approaches g, but it's still less than g unless θ=90, which is not an incline.

So, in all cases, ay is less than g, and ax is less than g.

Wait, but earlier when θ=60, ay was 0.75g, which is less than g. So, both are less than g.

So, the correct option would be C: ax <g; ay <g.

Wait, but looking at the options:

Option C: ax < g; ay < g.

So, that's the correct choice.
</think>

The car is moving up an incline of angle θ and coasts to a stop under the influence of gravity, with no friction or air resistance. The forces acting on the car are gravity (mg) and the normal force. The gravitational force is resolved into two components: one along the incline (mg sinθ) and one perpendicular to it (mg cosθ). The component along the incline causes deceleration, while the perpendicular component does not affect motion along the incline.

The acceleration along the incline is directed downward and has a magnitude of \( a_{\text{incline}} = g \sinθ \). To find the horizontal (\(a_x\)) and vertical (\(a_y\)) components of acceleration, we decompose \( a_{\text{incline}} \) into the x-y coordinate system:

- \( a_x = a_{\text{incline}} \cosθ = g \sinθ \cosθ \)
- \( a_y = a_{\text{incline}} \sinθ = g \sin^2θ \)

Since \( 0 < \sinθ < 1 \) for an incline (θ < 90°), both \( a_x \) and \( a_y \) are less than \( g \). For example:
- At θ = 30°, \( a_x = g \cdot 0.5 \cdot 0.866 \approx 0.433g \) and \( a_y = g \cdot 0.25 \approx 0.25g \).
- At θ = 60°, \( a_x = g \cdot 0.866 \cdot 0.5 \approx 0.433g \) and \( a_y = g \cdot 0.75 \approx 0.75g \).

In all cases, both \( a_x \) and \( a_y \) are less than \( g \). Therefore, the correct answer is:

**C: \( a_x < g \); \( a_y < g \)**

Answer: C
