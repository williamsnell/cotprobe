Okay, so I've got this problem here about markup percentages, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again: A tape deck sells for $200. The dollar markup is $80. I need to find the percent markup based on the selling price. The options are from A to J, with various percentages.

Wait, first, I need to remember what markup percentage means, especially when it's based on the selling price. From what I recall, markup is the amount added to the cost price to get the selling price. But here, the question specifies that the markup is based on the selling price, not the cost. So that's a bit different from the usual cost-based markup.

Let me jot down what I know. The selling price is $200, and the markup is $80. So, the cost price would be the selling price minus the markup. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, markup is usually added to the cost to get the selling price. So if the selling price is $200, and the markup is $80, then the cost price must be selling price minus markup, right?

Wait, no, that's not correct. Actually, the selling price is the cost plus the markup. So if the markup is $80, then the cost price should be selling price minus markup. So cost = 200 - 80 = $120. Wait, but that's the cost. But the question is about the markup based on the selling price, not the cost. So the formula for markup percentage based on selling price is (Markup / Selling Price) * 100.

So plugging in the numbers, the markup is $80, and the selling price is $200. So 80 divided by 200 equals 0.4, and then multiplied by 100 gives 40%. So the percentage markup is 40%.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm not mixing up the terms. Sometimes, markup can be calculated based on the cost, which would be (Markup / Cost) * 100. But the question specifically says it's based on the selling price, so I should definitely use the selling price as the denominator.

So the formula is (Markup Amount / Selling Price) * 100. So 80 / 200 = 0.4 → 40%. So the answer should be 40%, which is option A.

Wait, but just to double-check, let me think again. If the cost is $120, and the markup based on cost would be (80/120)*100 ≈ 66.67%, but that's not what's being asked here. The question is about markup based on the selling price, so it's correct to use 80/200, which is 40%. So yeah, option A is the correct choice.

The markup is $80, and the selling price is $200. To find the percent markup based on the selling price, use the formula (Markup / Selling Price) × 100. So, ($80 / $200) × 100 = 40%. 

Answer: A
