Alright, so I've got this question about inductors and finding the current through them at a specific time. It's a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let me think through each part carefully.

Okay, the question has three parts, (a), (b), and (c), each with different voltage expressions and time intervals. The goal is to find the current through a 0.1 H inductor at t=2s for each part, and then match the answers to the options provided.

Starting with part (a): The voltage across the inductor, V_L, is given as 0.5t volts for time t between 0 and 3 seconds. For times before 0 and after 3, the voltage is zero. Also, the initial current i_L is zero at t=-3s, which I think is just to set the starting point.

Since it's an inductor, I remember that the voltage across an inductor is related to the rate of change of current. The formula is V_L = L * (di_L/dt), where L is the inductance. Here, L is 0.1 H.

So, I can write the equation as 0.5t = 0.1 * (di/dt). To find the current, I need to integrate both sides with respect to time.

Let me rearrange the equation: di/dt = (0.5t)/0.1 = 5t. So, integrating di/dt from t=0 to t=2s will give me the change in current.

The integral of 5t dt is (5/2)t² + C, where C is the constant of integration. Since i_L is zero at t=0 (because the voltage starts at t=0, and before that, the voltage is zero), the constant C should be zero.

So, the current at t=2s would be (5/2)*(2)^2 = (5/2)*4 = 10 A. Wait, but let me check the options. Hmm, none of the options have 10 A as the first value. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe I missed something. The voltage is applied from t=0 to t=3. So, at t=2, which is within this interval, the integration from t=0 to t=2 is correct. So, 5t integrated from 0 to 2 is (5/2)(2^2 - 0^2) = 10 A. So part (a) answer is 10 A.

Moving on to part (b): Here, V_L is 0.5(t + 2) V for -2 ≤ t ≤1, and zero outside this range. The initial current at t=-3 is zero.

Again, using V_L = L di/dt, so 0.5(t+2) = 0.1 di/dt. Rearranging gives di/dt = 5(t + 2).

We need to find the current at t=2s. But wait, the voltage is only applied from t=-2 to t=1. At t=2, which is after the voltage stops, the inductor's current should remain constant because the voltage is zero, so no change in current after t=1.

But wait, let's compute the current up to t=1 first. We can integrate from t=-2 to t=1 to find the total current, and then that current remains constant for t>1.

So, integrating di/dt from t=-2 to t=1:

di = 5(t + 2) dt

Integrating from -2 to 1:

i = 5 ∫ (t+2) dt from -2 to 1.

The integral of (t+2) is (1/2)t² + 2t. Evaluating from -2 to 1:

At t=1: (1/2)(1)^2 + 2(1) = 0.5 + 2 = 2.5
At t=-2: (1/2)(4) + 2*(-2) = 2 -4 = -2
So the difference is 2.5 - (-2) = 4.5
Multiply by 5: 4.5 *5 = 22.5 A.

So, at t=1, the current is 22.5 A, and since after t=1, voltage is zero, the current remains 22.5 A at t=2s.

But looking at the options, the second part's answers are 24.5, 22.5, etc. So part (b)'s current is 22.5 A.

Now part (c): Here, the voltage is given as ν_L = 2/(t² +4) volts for all t. The initial current is zero as t approaches negative infinity.

Again, using V_L = L di/dt, so 2/(t² +4) = 0.1 di/dt.

Rearranging, di/dt = (2)/(0.1(t² +4)) = 20/(t² +4).

We need to integrate this from t=-infty to t=2s to find i_L at t=2.

So, i_L = ∫ (from -infty to 2) [20/(t² +4)] dt.

The integral of 1/(t² + a²) dt is (1/a) arctan(t/a) + C. Here, a²=4, so a=2.

So, ∫ [20/(t² +4)] dt = 20 * (1/2) arctan(t/2) ) + C = 10 arctan(t/2) + C.

Evaluating from -infty to 2:

At t=2: 10 arctan(2/2) = 10 arctan(1) = 10*(π/4) ≈ 10*(0.7854) ≈ 7.854 A.

At t=-infty: arctan(-infty/2) = arctan(-infty) = -π/2. So 10*(-π/2) ≈ -15.708 A.

Subtracting: 7.854 - (-15.708) = 23.562 A. Approximately 23.56 A.

Wait, but let me check the calculation again. The integral from -infty to 2 is [10 arctan(t/2)] from -infty to 2.

So, 10 [ arctan(2/2) - arctan(-infty/2) ].

arctan(1) is π/4, and arctan(-infty) is -π/2.

So, 10 [ π/4 - (-π/2) ] = 10 [ π/4 + π/2 ] = 10*(3π/4) = (10 * 3.1416/4 ) ≈ 10*(0.7854*3) ≈ 10*(2.3562) = 23.562 A.

So part (c) gives approximately 23.56 A.

Now, looking at the options, I need to match the three parts: (a) 10 A, (b) 22.5 A, (c) ~23.56 A.

Looking at the options:

Option H: 10, 22.5, 23.6. That seems to fit. So the answers are 10 A for part (a), 22.5 A for (b), and 23.6 A for (c).

Wait, but let me double-check part (a). I thought part (a) was 10 A, but option H's first value is 10 A. So that's correct.

Wait, but earlier when I checked part (a), I thought the answer was 10 A, but looking at the options, option H has 10, 22.5, 23.6. So that's the correct option.

The current through the inductor for each part is calculated as follows:

(a) Integrating the voltage from t=0 to t=2 gives **10 A**.  
(b) Integrating the voltage from t=-2 to t=1 and noting the current remains constant after t=1 gives **22.5 A**.  
(c) Integrating the voltage from t=-∞ to t=2 results in approximately **23.56 A**, which rounds to **23.6 A**.

The correct option is **H: 10 A, 22.5 A, 23.6 A**.
