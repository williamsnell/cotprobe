Okay, so I have this accounting question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question talks about an entity that prepares its financial statements on the income tax basis. The notes include a summary of significant accounting policies, which discusses the basis of presentation and how it differs from GAAP. The question is about where the dollar amount of the effects of the difference between the income tax basis and GAAP must be included.

Hmm, I remember from my studies that when financial statements are prepared using a basis other than GAAP, like the income tax basis, there are certain disclosures required. I think the key here is understanding what's required when the basis differs from GAAP.

So, the entity uses the income tax basis, which is different from GAAP. The notes already have a summary of significant accounting policies, so they've at least mentioned that the basis is different. But the question is about the dollar amount of the differences—like, do they have to quantify those differences and where?

I recall that if financial statements are prepared on a basis other than GAAP, the notes must explain the basis of presentation. But I also remember that the auditor's report might come into play. Specifically, if the financial statements aren't prepared in accordance with GAAP, the auditor has to mention that in the report.

Wait, but what about the dollar amounts? Do they need to be quantified and included in the financial statements or just in the notes? I think the notes should include a summary of the significant differences, but quantifying the exact dollar amounts might not always be required unless specified.

Also, I remember that if the financial statements are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, the auditor's report must include a separate section stating that. So the auditor would have to mention that the basis is different, but do they have to quantify the differences? I think the auditor just points out that the basis is different, not the exact dollar amounts.

So putting this together: the entity's notes already describe the basis and the differences. Now, regarding the dollar effects—do they need to be included in the balance sheet, income statement, or both? Or maybe just in the notes or the auditor's report.

From what I remember, the actual dollar amounts don't have to be included in the financial statements themselves (like the balance sheet or income statement) unless the basis is GAAP. Since this is on the income tax basis, the effects (differences) aren't part of the standard financial statements. So the dollar amounts wouldn't be in the balance sheet or income statement but might be in the notes or the auditor's report.

Wait, but the notes already include a summary of the policies. Do they need to quantify the differences there? Or is that not required? I think the summary of policies would explain the basis but doesn't necessarily have to include exact dollar figures. The main thing is that the financial statements are presented on that basis, and the auditor's report must state that.

So the dollar amount of the differences—like how much the net income or assets differ under GAAP versus the tax basis—wouldn't be included in the balance sheet or income statement. They might be discussed in the notes, but I'm not sure if they're required to be there or if it's optional.

Wait, no, the question says the notes include a summary that discusses the basis and describes the differences. So they've already done that part. Now, the question is about the dollar amount of the effects—so perhaps the exact figures. Are they required to be in the notes or the auditor's report?

I think the exact dollar amounts aren't required in the notes unless it's material. But if it's a significant difference, maybe it should be quantified. However, the options don't mention materiality, so I have to go by general rules.

I also remember that the auditor's report must mention that the financial statements are not prepared in accordance with GAAP if that's the case. But the auditor doesn't quantify the differences, just states the basis.

So the dollar effects (the actual amounts) would need to be included where? If the notes already describe the differences, but not the dollar amounts, then perhaps the dollar amounts aren't required. Wait, but the question says that the notes include a summary that "describes how that basis differs from GAAP." So they might have to explain the differences, but not necessarily quantify them unless they are material.

But the question is about the dollar amount of the effects. So perhaps that's not required to be included in the notes or the auditor's report. So the answer might be that they don't need to be quantified and included in the notes or auditor's report.

Looking at the options, option C says: "Need not be quantified and included in either the notes to the financial statements or the auditor's report."

But wait, isn't there a requirement for the notes to explain the basis? The notes already do that, but do they need to include the dollar amounts? I'm a bit confused here.

Alternatively, maybe the dollar amounts are required in the notes. But I'm not sure. Let me think again.

In the case where financial statements are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, the notes must explain the basis. The dollar amounts of differences are not required in the financial statements themselves (balance sheet or income statement) because they're not GAAP. So the dollar effects would only be included if the entity chooses to disclose them in the notes, but they aren't required to quantify them and include them in either the notes or the auditor's report.

Wait, but the notes already have a summary that discusses the basis, but not the dollar amounts. So the question is about whether the dollar amounts need to be included. If the notes already describe the basis, but not the dollar amounts, then perhaps the dollar amounts don't have to be included in the notes or the auditor's report.

So the correct answer would be option C: Need not be quantified and included in either the notes or the auditor's report.

The question revolves around whether the dollar amount of the effects of differences between the income tax basis and GAAP must be included in specific financial statements or reports. The entity prepares its financial statements on the income tax basis, and the notes already describe the basis and differences from GAAP. 

Key points to consider:
1. Financial statements prepared on a basis other than GAAP require a basis of presentation explanation in the notes.
2. The auditor's report must state that the financial statements are not prepared in accordance with GAAP but does not require quantification of differences.
3. Dollar amounts of differences are not required in the balance sheet or income statement when the basis is not GAAP.
4. The notes may explain the basis but do not necessarily need to include exact dollar figures unless material, which is not specified here.

Given this, the dollar amounts of the effects need not be quantified and included in either the notes or the auditor's report.
