Question:

Which of the following is true about the knee joint?

Options:

A: The patellar tap is used to demonstrate an effusion
B: 'knock knee' deformity is due to bilateral genu varum
C: The knee joint is the smallest joint in the body
D: The knee is a hinge joint that only allows flexion and extension
E: A baker's cyst can sometimes be found anterior to the knee

H: The patella is not part of the knee joint
I: The knee is a ball and socket joint
J: 'Bow leg' deformity is due to bilateral genu valgum

Okay, I've got this multiple-choice question about the knee joint, and I need to figure out which option is correct. Let's go through each option one by one.

Option A: The patellar tap is used to demonstrate an effusion. I remember that the patellar tap, also known as the ballottement test, is a physical exam maneuver used to check for joint effusion. When there's fluid in the knee, the patella might float higher when tapped, so A sounds correct.

Option B: 'Knock knee' deformity is due to bilateral genu varum. Wait, knock knees are when the knees bend inward, so that's genu valgum, not varum. Genu varum is when the knees are bowed outward, like in bow legs. So B is incorrect because knock knees are valgum, not varum.

Option C: The knee joint is the smallest joint in the body. I don't think so. The knee is a large, complex joint, so it's definitely not the smallest. The smallest might be the wrist or something else. So C is wrong.

Option D: The knee is a hinge joint that only allows flexion and extension. Well, the knee is a hinge joint, which allows bending and straightening (flexion and extension). But wait, it can also rotate slightly, especially during activities like walking or running. So saying it only allows flexion and extension isn't entirely accurate. D might not be correct.

Option E: A baker's cyst can sometimes be found anterior to the knee. Baker's cysts, or popliteal cysts, usually form behind the knee. Anterior would be the front, so E is incorrect.

Option F: The knee joint is not capable of rotation. As I thought earlier, the knee can rotate a little, so F is wrong.

Option G: The knee joint includes the hip bone. The knee joint is between the femur and the tibia. The hip bone is part of the hip joint, so G is incorrect.

Option H: The patella is not part of the knee joint. No, the patella is part of the knee joint, acting as a protective shield and aiding in knee extension. So H is wrong.

Option I: The knee is a ball and socket joint. No, the knee is a hinge joint, not a ball and socket. The hip is a ball and socket. So I is incorrect.

Option J: 'Bow leg' deformity is due to bilateral genu valgum. Bow legs are when the knees are too far apart, which is genu varum, not valgum. Genu valgum is knock knees. So J is wrong.

So reviewing, the correct statements are A (patellar tap for effusion) and maybe D, but D says only flexion and extension. Wait, hinge joints allow some rotation, so D is incorrect. So the only correct one is A.

The correct answer is A.
