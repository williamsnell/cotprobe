Okay, so I need to calculate the change in entropy when liquid water at -5°C and 1 atm changes to ice at the same temperature and pressure. Hmm, I remember that entropy change involves heat transfer and temperature. Let me think about the steps.

First, I recall that entropy change for a process can be calculated using the formula ΔS = q_rev / T, where q is the heat in a reversible process and T is the temperature in Kelvin. Since the process is a phase change from liquid to solid (freezing), I think it's the reverse of fusion. 

Wait, the data given includes the heat of fusion, ΔH_fusion, which is the heat absorbed when ice melts to water. So for freezing, it would be the negative of that, right? So ΔH_fusion is 1440 cal/mol at 0°C. But here, the temperature is -5°C, so maybe I need to adjust for that.

Wait, no, wait. The process here is at -5°C, so the phase change isn't happening at the melting point. Oh, wait, actually, when the temperature is below 0°C, liquid water can freeze without changing temperature. So the process involves cooling the liquid water from -5°C to 0°C, then freezing it at 0°C, and then cooling the ice from 0°C to -5°C. No, wait, no—wait, no, because we're starting at -5°C liquid and ending at -5°C ice. So the process is: liquid at -5°C → liquid at 0°C → ice at 0°C → ice at -5°C. But wait, no, that's not right because the initial and final states are both at -5°C. So maybe the process is just the phase change at -5°C? But phase changes typically happen at the melting point, so maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, no, actually, the process is phase change at a temperature where both phases coexist. But since -5°C is below 0°C, the phase change would occur at 0°C. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

The process is: liquid water at -5°C → ice at -5°C. So perhaps the steps are: first, cool the liquid from -5°C to 0°C, then freeze it at 0°C, and then cool the ice from 0°C to -5°C. Wait, no, because the final state is ice at -5°C, so maybe the process is cooling the liquid to 0°C, then freezing, then cooling the ice further to -5°C. But wait, that would involve two steps: cooling the liquid, then freezing, then cooling the ice. But the problem is asking for the entropy change when going from liquid at -5°C to ice at -5°C. So perhaps the steps are:

1. Cool the liquid from -5°C to 0°C.
2. Freeze the liquid at 0°C into ice.
3. Cool the ice from 0°C to -5°C.

So the entropy change would be the sum of the entropy changes for each step.

Wait, but when you cool the liquid from -5 to 0, the entropy change is calculated using the specific heat of liquid. Similarly for the ice cooling. The freezing step involves the heat of fusion, but since it's freezing, it's exothermic, so the q would be negative.

Alternatively, maybe I can approach it differently. Since the process is from liquid at -5°C to ice at -5°C, perhaps I can consider the heat released as the liquid cools to 0°C, then the heat released when freezing, then the heat released as the ice cools to -5°C. Because all these steps are exothermic, the q would be negative, leading to a negative entropy change.

Let me write down the steps:

1. Cooling liquid water from T1 = -5°C to T2 = 0°C.
   The entropy change for this step is ΔS1 = (mass × Cp_liquid × ln(T2/T1)) / something. Wait, no, the formula is ΔS = ∫(dQ_rev / T). Since Cp is constant, ΔS = Cp * ln(T2/T1), but wait, T must be in Kelvin.

Wait, I think the correct formula for entropy change when cooling at constant pressure is ΔS = n Cp ln(T2 / T1), but wait, no, Cp is at constant pressure, but entropy change uses the integral of dQ_rev over T. So for a substance cooling from T1 to T2, the entropy change is n Cp ln(T2/T1), but wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute the heat released in each step and then divide by the temperature.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute the entropy change for each step. Let's proceed step by step.

First, cooling liquid water from -5°C to 0°C.

The heat released is q1 = n * Cp_liquid * (T_initial - T_final). Wait, but since the temperature is decreasing, T_initial is -5°C, which is 268.15 K, and T_final is 0°C, which is 273.15 K.

Wait, but actually, when cooling, the temperature is going from higher to lower. So q1 would be negative because heat is released.

So q1 = n * Cp_liquid * (T_final - T_initial) = n * 18 cal/mol·°C * (273.15 - 268.15) = n * 18 * 5 = 90 n cal.

Wait, no, because in terms of Kelvin, the change is 5 K. So q1 = n * Cp_liquid * (T_final - T_initial) = n * 18 * (5) = 90 n cal. But since it's cooling, the system releases heat, so q is negative, so q1 = -90 n cal.

Wait, no, I think I'm mixing up signs. When the system releases heat, q is negative. So q1 = m * Cp * (T_final - T_initial) = n * 18 * (273.15 - 268.15) = 18 * 5 = 90 n cal, but since the system is losing heat, q1 = -90 n cal.

Wait, but I'm not sure if I should take it as positive or negative. Let me think again: when the system (water) loses heat, q is negative. So q1 = -90 n cal.

The entropy change for this step is ΔS1 = q1_rev / T_avg. Wait, but when T is changing, the correct way is to integrate dQ/T. Since Cp is constant, the entropy change is ΔS = n Cp ln(T_final / T_initial).

So for the first step, T_initial = 268.15 K, T_final = 273.15 K. So ΔS1 = n * 18 cal/(mol·K) * ln(273.15 / 268.15).

Wait, but wait, Cp is in cal/(mol·°C), but we're using Kelvin, so since a change in °C is the same as a change in K, it's okay. So ln(273.15/268.15) ≈ ln(1.0179) ≈ 0.0177.

So ΔS1 ≈ n * 18 * 0.0177 ≈ n * 0.3186 cal/K.

Wait, but since the system is losing heat, the entropy change would be negative. So ΔS1 = -0.3186 n cal/K.

Wait, no, because for the system, when you cool it, the entropy decreases. So yes, ΔS1 is negative.

Second step: Freezing the water at 0°C (273.15 K) into ice. The heat released is the heat of fusion, but since it's freezing, it's the negative of the heat of fusion. So q2 = -ΔH_fusion = -1440 n cal.

The entropy change for this step is ΔS2 = q2 / T = (-1440 n cal) / 273.15 K ≈ (-5.263 n) cal/K.

Third step: Cooling the ice from 0°C to -5°C.

The heat released here is q3 = n * Cp_ice * (0 - (-5)) = n * 9 * 5 = 45 n cal. Again, the system is losing heat, so q3 = -45 n cal.

The entropy change for this step is ΔS3 = n * Cp_ice * ln(T_final / T_initial) = n * 9 * ln(268.15 / 273.15).

Wait, T_initial is 273.15 K, T_final is 268.15 K. So ln(268.15/273.15) ≈ ln(0.9816) ≈ -0.0189.

So ΔS3 ≈ n * 9 * (-0.0189) ≈ n * (-0.1701) cal/K.

So total entropy change is ΔS_total = ΔS1 + ΔS2 + ΔS3.

Plugging in the numbers:

ΔS1 ≈ -0.3186 n

ΔS2 ≈ -5.263 n

ΔS3 ≈ -0.1701 n

So sum: (-0.3186 -5.263 -0.1701) n ≈ (-5.7517) n cal/K.

Wait, but wait, the units are in cal/(mol·K), so per mole, it's about -5.7517 cal/(mol·K).

But looking at the options, they're in "eu", which I think stands for entropy units, perhaps cal/(mol·K) is equivalent to eu.

Wait, but the options are:

A: -2.22eu

B: -5.1eu

C: 1.440eu

D: -1.440eu

E: 2.22eu

F: -0.166eu

G: -5.27eu

H: -0.144eu

I: 0.333eu

J: 0.144eu

Wait, so my calculation gives approximately -5.75 eu. But none of the options match that. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, maybe I didn't account for the fact that the heat is released, so the entropy change is negative. Let me check my calculations again.

Wait, perhaps I should have considered the heat flows as positive when heat is released by the system (i.e., when the process is exothermic). So for each step:

1. Cooling liquid: q1 = -90 n cal (system loses heat)
   ΔS1 = q1 / T_avg = (-90 n) / (average temp between 268.15 and 273.15 K)
   Wait, perhaps I should calculate it as an integral, which would be Cp ln(T2/T1).

Wait, another approach: the entropy change for cooling the liquid is:

ΔS1 = n Cp_liquid ln(T_final / T_initial) = n * 18 * ln(273.15/268.15) ≈ n * 18 * 0.0177 ≈ 0.3186 n cal/K.

But since the system is cooling, the entropy decreases, so ΔS1 is negative: -0.3186 n.

Similarly, for freezing, q2 = -1440 n, so ΔS2 = (-1440 n) / 273.15 ≈ -5.263 n.

For cooling ice: ΔS3 = n Cp_ice ln(268.15/273.15) = n *9 * (-0.0189) ≈ -0.1701 n.

So total ΔS = (-0.3186 -5.263 -0.1701) n ≈ -5.7517 n.

But the options don't have this. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Maybe the process is simply the phase change at -5°C, which isn't possible because phase changes occur at the melting point (0°C). So perhaps the process is only the freezing at 0°C, but that would be if we're going from -5°C liquid to 0°C ice, but that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be a phase change at 0°C, but the initial and final temps are -5°C. Wait, perhaps the problem is simpler. Maybe the process is cooling liquid from -5°C to ice at -5°C, which involves two steps: cooling the liquid to 0°C, freezing at 0°C, and then cooling the ice to -5°C.

Wait, but perhaps the problem assumes that the process is just the phase change at 0°C, but that's not the case here because the initial and final temps are -5°C.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to calculate the entropy change for the phase change at 0°C, but adjusted for the temperature difference. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: the entropy change when cooling from T1 to T2 is n Cp ln(T2/T1), and when freezing, it's -ΔH_fusion / T_melt.

So perhaps the total entropy change is the sum of cooling the liquid to 0°C, freezing at 0°C, and cooling the ice to -5°C.

So:

ΔS = ΔS_liquid_cooling + ΔS_freezing + ΔS_ice_cooling.

Calculate each:

ΔS_liquid_cooling = n * 18 * ln(273.15/268.15) ≈ n * 18 * 0.0177 ≈ 0.3186 n cal/K, but negative because cooling, so -0.3186 n.

ΔS_freezing = (-1440 n) / 273.15 ≈ -5.263 n.

ΔS_ice_cooling = n * 9 * ln(268.15/273.15) ≈ n * 9 * (-0.0189) ≈ -0.1701 n.

Total ΔS = (-0.3186 -5.263 -0.1701) n ≈ -5.7517 n.

But the options don't have this. The closest option is G: -5.27eu, which is about -5.27 n. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should have considered that the freezing step occurs at 0°C, so the entropy change is -ΔH_fusion / T, which is -1440 / 273.15 ≈ -5.263 n.

The other steps: cooling the liquid and ice.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Cp values. Let me check the given data:

C_p for H2O(s) = 9 cal/(deg·mol)

C_p for H2O(l) = 18 cal/(deg·mol)

ΔH_fusion @0°C is 1440 cal/mol.

So when cooling the liquid from -5°C to 0°C, the temperature change is 5°C, and Cp is 18. So the entropy change is n * 18 * ln(273.15/268.15) ≈ n * 18 * 0.0177 ≈ 0.3186 n. But since it's cooling, it's negative: -0.3186 n.

Similarly, when cooling the ice from 0°C to -5°C, the entropy change is n *9 * ln(268.15/273.15) ≈ n *9 * (-0.0189) ≈ -0.1701 n.

So total ΔS = (-0.3186 -5.263 -0.1701) n ≈ -5.7517 n.

But the options don't have this. Let me check the options again. Option G is -5.27eu, which is close to the freezing step's entropy change of -5.263 n. But the total is more negative.

Wait, perhaps the problem is only considering the phase change at 0°C, not the temperature adjustment. But that can't be because the initial and final states are at -5°C.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is intended to calculate the entropy change for the phase change at -5°C, but that's not possible because phase changes occur at the melting point. So maybe the problem is considering a reversible process, and the entropy change is only due to the heat of fusion, but adjusted for temperature.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to calculate the entropy change for cooling from -5°C liquid to -5°C ice, which would involve only the phase change at 0°C, but that doesn't make sense because the temps are at -5°C.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently. Maybe the problem is simply to calculate the entropy change for the phase change (freezing) at 0°C, and not consider the temperature change from -5°C to 0°C. But that doesn't align with the given data.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the process is cooling the liquid from -5°C to ice at -5°C, which involves two steps:

1. Cooling liquid from -5°C to 0°C: ΔS1 = n * Cp_liquid * ln(273.15/268.15) ≈ 0.3186 n, but negative: -0.3186 n.

2. Freezing at 0°C: ΔS2 = -1440 / 273.15 ≈ -5.263 n.

3. Cooling ice from 0°C to -5°C: ΔS3 = n * Cp_ice * ln(268.15/273.15) ≈ -0.1701 n.

Total: (-0.3186 -5.263 -0.1701) n ≈ -5.7517 n.

But again, I don't see this in the options. The closest is G: -5.27eu, which is just the freezing step. So perhaps the problem is only considering the freezing step, ignoring the temperature changes. But that would be incorrect because the initial and final states are at -5°C.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the Cp values. Let me check the units. The Cp is given in cal/(°C·mol), so when using in entropy calculations, which are in Kelvin, it's okay because a change in °C is the same as a change in K.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate each step's entropy change more accurately.

Calculating ΔS1:

T1 = 268.15 K, T2 = 273.15 K.

ΔS1 = n * 18 * ln(273.15/268.15).

Compute ln(273.15/268.15) = ln(1.017906) ≈ 0.01778.

So ΔS1 ≈ 18 * 0.01778 ≈ 0.3199 cal/(mol·K) → but since cooling, ΔS1 = -0.3199 n.

ΔS2 = (-1440 n) / 273.15 ≈ -5.263 n.

ΔS3 = n *9 * ln(268.15/273.15) = 9 * ln(0.9816) ≈ 9*(-0.0189) ≈ -0.1701 n.

So total ΔS ≈ (-0.3199 -5.263 -0.1701) n ≈ -5.753 n.

Hmm, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the cooling steps and only consider the phase change. So if we only consider the freezing at 0°C, ΔS = -1440 / 273.15 ≈ -5.263 n, which is approximately -5.27 n, matching option G.

But the process involves cooling to 0°C, freezing, then cooling the ice. So I'm confused why the options don't include the total. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the process occurs at constant temperature, but that's not the case.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the process is isothermal, but that's not possible because the phase change occurs at 0°C, not at -5°C. So maybe the problem is intended to calculate the entropy change only for the phase change, ignoring the temperature changes. That would give ΔS = -5.263 n, matching option G.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the process is cooling from -5°C to 0°C, then freezing, but not cooling the ice further. So only steps 1 and 2.

ΔS_total = (-0.3199 -5.263) n ≈ -5.583 n. Still not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps I should recalculate the freezing step. ΔH_fusion is 1440 cal/mol, so for freezing, it's -1440 cal/mol. So ΔS = (-1440) / 273.15 ≈ -5.263 cal/(mol·K). So per mole, that's about -5.263 eu.

Looking at the options, option G is -5.27eu, which is very close. So perhaps the intended answer is G.

But why? Because the problem is about the phase change at 0°C, but the initial and final states are at -5°C. Hmm, maybe the problem expects only the phase change entropy, ignoring the temperature changes. Or perhaps the Cp steps are negligible compared to the phase change.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in including the cooling steps. Let me think: when moving from liquid at -5°C to ice at -5°C, the process is cooling the liquid to 0°C, freezing, then cooling the ice to -5°C. So all three steps contribute.

But the calculation gives approximately -5.75 n, which isn't an option. The closest is G: -5.27eu.

Wait, perhaps the problem is intended to calculate only the phase change's entropy, which is option G. So maybe the answer is G.
</think>

To calculate the change in entropy when liquid water at -5°C and 1 atm transitions to ice at -5°C and 1 atm, we consider the process in three steps:

1. **Cooling the liquid water from -5°C to 0°C**:  
   The entropy change for this step is calculated using the formula:  
   \[
   \Delta S_1 = n \cdot C_{p,\text{liquid}} \cdot \ln\left(\frac{T_{\text{final}}}{T_{\text{initial}}}\right)
   \]  
   where \(T_{\text{initial}} = 268.15 \, \text{K}\) and \(T_{\text{final}} = 273.15 \, \text{K}\). Substituting \(C_{p,\text{liquid}} = 18 \, \text{cal/(mol·°C)}\):  
   \[
   \Delta S_1 = n \cdot 18 \cdot \ln\left(\frac{273.15}{268.15}\right) \approx n \cdot 18 \cdot 0.0177 \approx n \cdot 0.3186 \, \text{cal/(mol·K)}.
   \]  
   Since the system is cooling, the entropy change is negative:  
   \[
   \Delta S_1 \approx -0.3186 \, n \, \text{cal/(mol·K)}.
   \]

2. **Freezing the water at 0°C**:  
   The entropy change for this step is given by:  
   \[
   \Delta S_2 = \frac{-\Delta H_{\text{fusion}}}{T_{\text{fusion}}}.
   \]  
   Substituting \(\Delta H_{\text{fusion}} = 1440 \, \text{cal/mol}\) and \(T_{\text{fusion}} = 273.15 \, \text{K}\):  
   \[
   \Delta S_2 = \frac{-1440 \cdot n}{273.15} \approx -5.263 \, n \, \text{cal/(mol·K)}.
   \]

3. **Cooling the ice from 0°C to -5°C**:  
   The entropy change for this step is calculated similarly to the first step:  
   \[
   \Delta S_3 = n \cdot C_{p,\text{ice}} \cdot \ln\left(\frac{T_{\text{final}}}{T_{\text{initial}}}\right).
   \]  
   Substituting \(C_{p,\text{ice}} = 9 \, \text{cal/(mol·°C)}\), \(T_{\text{initial}} = 273.15 \, \text{K}\), and \(T_{\text{final}} = 268.15 \, \text{K}\):  
   \[
   \Delta S_3 = n \cdot 9 \cdot \ln\left(\frac{268.15}{273.15}\right) \approx n \cdot 9 \cdot (-0.0189) \approx -0.1701 \, n \, \text{cal/(mol·K)}.
   \]

**Total Entropy Change**:  
Summing the entropy changes for all three steps:  
\[
\Delta S_{\text{total}} = \Delta S_1 + \Delta S_2 + \Delta S_3 \approx (-0.3186) + (-5.263) + (-0.1701) \approx -5.7517 \, n \, \text{cal/(mol·K)}.
\]

However, the closest option to the calculated value is **-5.27 eu**, which corresponds to the entropy change for the freezing step alone. This suggests the problem may be focusing only on the phase change at 0°C, ignoring the temperature adjustments. Thus, the best answer is:

**G: -5.27eu**

Answer: G
