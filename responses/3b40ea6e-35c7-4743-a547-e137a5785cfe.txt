Okay, so I have this problem here about an 11-liter flask containing neon and hydrogen. I need to find the average molecular weight, the grams of hydrogen, and the pressure. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

First, the problem states that the flask has 20 grams of neon and an unknown weight of hydrogen. The density of the gas mixture is 0.002 grams per cubic centimeter at 0°C. Oh wait, 0°C is 273.15 K. The atomic weight of neon is given as 20 g/mol.

I remember that density (d) is related to molar mass (M) and pressure (P) through the ideal gas law. The formula I think is d = (PM)/RT. So, if I can find the total pressure, I can maybe use that to find the average molecular weight. Wait, but I also need to find the grams of hydrogen, so I might need to approach this differently.

Wait, the total mass of the gas in the flask is the sum of neon and hydrogen. The flask's volume is 11 liters, which is 11,000 cubic centimeters because 1 liter is 1000 cm³. So, density is mass over volume. So, mass = density × volume. Let me calculate that.

Density is 0.002 g/cm³, volume is 11,000 cm³. So mass = 0.002 * 11,000 = 22 grams. Oh, so the total mass of the gas mixture is 22 grams. Since we have 20 grams of neon, the mass of hydrogen must be 22 - 20 = 2 grams? Wait, but looking at the options, option G says 2 grams of hydrogen. But wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me double-check.

Wait, the total mass is 0.002 g/cm³ * 11,000 cm³ = 22 grams. Yes, because 11,000 * 0.002 = 22. So, 20 grams are neon, so 2 grams must be hydrogen. So the grams of hydrogen present is 2 grams. Looking at the options, G has 2 grams, and E, F, G, etc. So that's one part done.

Next, I need to find the average molecular weight. The average molecular weight (M_avg) is the total mass divided by the total number of moles. Wait, but maybe another approach is to use the density formula with the ideal gas law.

Alternatively, I can use the formula for density in terms of molar mass. The formula is d = (PM)/(RT), where d is in g/L, P in atm, M in g/mol, R is 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K), and T is in Kelvin.

Wait, but wait, the density given is 0.002 g/cm³, which is 20 g/L because 1 cm³ is 0.001 L, so 0.002 g/cm³ = 20 g/L. Because multiply by 1000 cm³/L: 0.002 * 1000 = 20 g/L. Oh right, that makes sense, because 1 L is 1000 cm³.

So d = 20 g/L. Now, using d = PM/(RT), I can solve for P if I know M_avg. Or wait, I can rearrange this to find M_avg = dRT/(P). But I don't know P yet. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe I can find the total moles of the gas mixture first, then compute the average molecular weight from the total mass and moles.

Wait, the total mass is 22 grams, and the total volume is 11 liters at 0°C (273 K). Using the ideal gas law PV = nRT. But I don't know P yet. Alternatively, perhaps I can find the total moles in terms of the average molecular weight.

Wait, another approach: the total number of moles is (mass of neon)/(molar mass of neon) + (mass of hydrogen)/(molar mass of hydrogen). Neon's molar mass is 20 g/mol, so moles of neon = 20 / 20 = 1 mole. Hydrogen's molar mass is about 2 g/mol, so if the mass is 2 grams, moles of H2 = 2 / 2 = 1 mole. So total moles = 1 + 1 = 2 moles.

So n_total = 2 moles. Then, using PV = nRT, P = nRT / V. R is 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K), T is 273 K, V is 11 L.

So P = (2 * 0.0821 * 273) / 11.

Let me calculate that: 2 * 0.0821 = 0.1642. 0.1642 * 273 ≈ 0.1642 * 270 = 44.334 plus 0.1642 *3 = 0.4926 → total ≈ 44.8266. Then divide by 11: 44.8266 / 11 ≈ 4.075 atm. So approximately 4.07 atm. That would correspond to option G, which has 4.07 atm and 2 grams of hydrogen.

Wait, but option G says average molecular weight is 11 g/mol. Let me check that. Average molecular weight is (total mass) / (total moles). Total mass is 22 g, total moles is 2, so 22 / 2 = 11 g/mol. Yes, that's correct. So the average molecular weight is 11 g/mol.

So putting it all together: grams of hydrogen is 2 grams, average molecular weight is 11 g/mol, and pressure is approximately 4.07 atm. That's option G: "2 gm of hydrogen, 11 gm/mole, 4.07 atm."

The problem involves an 11-liter flask containing 20 g of neon and an unknown amount of hydrogen. The gas density is 0.002 g/cm³ at 0°C (273 K). The goal is to determine the grams of hydrogen, the average molecular weight, and the pressure.

1. **Total Mass Calculation**:  
   The total mass of the gas mixture is calculated using the density formula:  
   \[
   \text{Mass} = \text{Density} \times \text{Volume}
   \]  
   Converting the volume to cubic centimeters:  
   \[
   11 \, \text{L} = 11,000 \, \text{cm}^3
   \]  
   \[
   \text{Mass} = 0.002 \, \text{g/cm}^3 \times 11,000 \, \text{cm}^3 = 22 \, \text{g}
   \]  
   Since 20 g is neon, the remaining mass is hydrogen:  
   \[
   \text{Mass of hydrogen} = 22 \, \text{g} - 20 \, \text{g} = 2 \, \text{g}
   \]

2. **Average Molecular Weight Calculation**:  
   The average molecular weight (\(M_{\text{avg}}\)) is given by:  
   \[
   M_{\text{avg}} = \frac{\text{Total Mass}}{\text{Total Moles}}
   \]  
   The total moles are calculated as:  
   \[
   \text{Moles of neon} = \frac{20 \, \text{g}}{20 \, \text{g/mol}} = 1 \, \text{mol}
   \]  
   \[
   \text{Moles of hydrogen} = \frac{2 \, \text{g}}{2 \, \text{g/mol}} = 1 \, \text{mol}
   \]  
   \[
   \text{Total Moles} = 1 \, \text{mol} + 1 \, \text{mol} = 2 \, \text{mol}
   \]  
   \[
   M_{\text{avg}} = \frac{22 \, \text{g}}{2 \, \text{mol}} = 11 \, \text{g/mol}
   \]

3. **Pressure Calculation**:  
   Using the ideal gas law \(PV = nRT\), where \(R = 0.0821 \, \text{L·atm/(mol·K)}\), \(T = 273 \, \text{K}\), and \(V = 11 \, \text{L}\):  
   \[
   P = \frac{nRT}{V}
   \]  
   Substituting the values:  
   \[
   P = \frac{2 \, \text{mol} \times 0.0821 \, \text{L·atm/(mol·K)} \times 273 \, \text{K}}{11 \, \text{L}}
   \]  
   \[
   P \approx 4.07 \, \text{atm}
   \]

From the calculations:  
- Grams of hydrogen = 2 g  
- Average molecular weight = 11 g/mol  
- Pressure = 4.07 atm  

The correct answer is **G: 2 gm of hydrogen, 11 gm/mole, 4.07 atm**.

**Answer: G**
