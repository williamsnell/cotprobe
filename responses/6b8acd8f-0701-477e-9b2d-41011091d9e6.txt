Okay, so I need to figure out the answer to this question about Carruther's view on moral criticism regarding animals. The question is asking where the justification for this criticism comes from, and I have to choose from options A to J.

First, I should think about who Carruthers is. Peter Carruthers is a philosopher known for his work in ethics and animal welfare. I recall that he has written about the moral status of animals and the implications for how we treat them.

The question is about the justification for moral criticism. So, when we do or don't do something to an animal, why is it morally criticizing us? I think this relates to the reasons behind our moral obligations towards animals.

Looking at the options:

A: The animal's lifespan. Hmm, lifespan might relate to how long an animal lives, but I'm not sure how that directly ties into moral justification. Maybe if lifespan is a measure of their existence, but I'm not certain.

B: The animal's direct moral standing. This seems relevant. If animals have direct moral standing, it means they are ends in themselves and not just means to an end. Carruthers probably argues that animals have intrinsic value, which would underpin moral criticism.

C: Societal norms and expectations. This is more about what society deems acceptable, but I think Carruthers focuses more on intrinsic moral reasons rather than just societal norms.

D: The animal's role in the ecosystem. While important, this might be more about instrumental value (how animals contribute to the ecosystem) rather than their direct moral standing.

E: The animal's inability to defend itself. That could be a factor, but I think it's more about empathy or power dynamics, not the main justification for moral criticism.

F: The bad qualities of character our actions evince. This seems more about our own moral failing, but I'm not sure if Carruthers uses this as the primary justification for criticizing actions towards animals.

G: The animal's intelligence level. Carruthers might discuss intelligence in his arguments, but I think the key point is more about their intrinsic value rather than their intelligence.

H: The animal's capacity for emotion. Emotion could relate to suffering, which is a factor, but again, I think the main point is their direct moral standing.

Putting it together, Carruthers likely argues that animals have direct moral standing, meaning their interests are important in themselves. This would justify moral criticism of actions towards them. So the answer should be B.

The justification for moral criticism in Carruther's view stems from the animal's direct moral standing, as he emphasizes their intrinsic value and not merely their utility or other attributes.

Answer: B
