Okay, so I've got this question about the ingredients of the solar nebula and their mass percentages from highest to lowest. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that the solar nebula was the cloud of gas and dust that formed the solar system. The main components would be gases, followed by ices and then metals and rocks, I think. But wait, I'm not entirely sure about the order.

I recall that the most abundant elements in the universe are hydrogen and helium. So the solar nebula, being mostly from the interstellar medium, should have a lot of these light gases. But wait, the options mix up different categories like light gases, hydrogen compounds, metals, and rocks.

Hydrogen and helium are the lightest, so they would make up the majority of the mass? Or wait, no, because mass-wise, heavier elements take up more mass but are less in quantity. Wait, no, because hydrogen is the most abundant by number, but when considering mass, it's still a big chunk because even though each atom is light, there's so much of it.

Wait, the solar nebula was mostly hydrogen, then helium, then heavier elements. But the heavier elements like metals and rocks make up a smaller percentage of the total mass. So the order should be from highest to lowest: light gases (H and He), then hydrogen compounds (like water, methane, ammonia), then metals, and then rocks. Hmm, but I'm not sure if hydrogen compounds come before or after metals.

Wait, maybe the order is light gases first because they're the most abundant in volume, but when considering mass, maybe the heavier elements have a higher mass percentage? No, I think the mass is dominated by hydrogen and helium because they're the primary components.

Wait, let me think again. The solar nebula's composition is mostly hydrogen (H), then helium (He), then heavier elements like oxygen, carbon, etc., which form ices and other compounds. So the list should start with H and He, then the hydrogen compounds, then metals, then rocks?

Wait, no, because metals are elements like iron, which are heavier, and rocks are silicates and such. So the order by mass percentage from highest to lowest would be light gases (H and He), then hydrogen compounds (like H2O, CH4, NH3), then metals, then rocks.

Wait, but another perspective: the denser materials like rocks and metals would have been in the inner regions, but in terms of overall mass in the nebula, the light gases would be more abundant. So the highest percentage is light gases, then hydrogen compounds, then metals, then rocks. But looking at the options, let me check.

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option B: light gases, hydrogen compounds, metals, rocks. So that's H He, then H2O etc., then metals, then rocks. That fits what I was thinking. But wait, another thought: the initial nebula is mostly H and He, then the next is ices (hydrogen compounds), then metals, then rocks. So the order from highest to lowest is light gases, hydrogen compounds, metals, rocks.

Wait, but looking at the options, let me see:

Option B is light gases, then hydrogen compounds, then metals, then rocks. That seems correct. But wait, I'm a bit confused because sometimes people say that the solar nebula's composition includes about 74% H, 24% He, and 2% heavier elements. So the heavier elements (metals and rocks) make up about 2%, with the hydrogen compounds (ices) being part of that 2%? Or perhaps the hydrogen compounds are part of the heavier elements.

Wait, the hydrogen compounds are things like water, methane, ammonia, which are made of hydrogen and other elements like O, C, N. So they're part of the heavier elements but still contain hydrogen. So in terms of mass, the light gases (H and He) are the highest, followed by the ices (hydrogen compounds), then metals, then rocks.

So the order would be light gases (H He) first, then hydrogen compounds, then metals, then rocks. So looking at the options, that would be option B: light gases, hydrogen compounds, metals, rocks.

Wait, but another thought: the initial nebula is 74% H, 24% He, and 2% others. The 2% includes heavier elements, which include metals and rocks, plus ices. So the ices are part of the 2%, but the hydrogen and helium are the vast majority.

So the order by mass percentage from highest to lowest would be: light gases (H He) at about 98%, then hydrogen compounds (ices) at maybe 1.5% of the total, then metals, then rocks.

Wait, but that might not be accurate. Alternatively, the nebula's composition is 74% H, 24% He, and 2% heavier elements. So the heavier elements include ices, metals, and rocks. So the order would be H and He first, then the heavier elements, but how are they ordered among themselves?

I think the heavier elements have a small percentage, so the order after H and He would be hydrogen compounds (ices), then metals, then rocks. So the list from highest to lowest would be:

1. Light gases (H He)
2. Hydrogen compounds
3. Metals
4. Rocks

Which matches option B.

Wait, but looking at option G: metals, rocks, hydrogen compounds, light gases. That doesn't seem right because H and He are the majority. So I think option B is correct.

The solar nebula's composition is primarily dominated by hydrogen and helium, which make up the majority of its mass. Following these light gases are hydrogen compounds (such as water, methane, and ammonia), then metals, and finally rocks. This order reflects the decreasing mass percentages from highest to lowest. 

Answer: B
