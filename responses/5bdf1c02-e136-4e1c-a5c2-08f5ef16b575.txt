Answer:
    
<think>
Okay, so I have this logic problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about determining whether a set of propositions is consistent using indirect truth tables. If it's consistent, I need to pick an option that gives a consistent valuation. The options are from A to J, each describing different scenarios.

First, let me list out the propositions given:

1. A ⊃ (~B ∨ C)
2. C ⊃ D
3. A ∨ (B · ~D)
4. A ≡ (B ⊃ D)

I need to check if these four propositions can all be true at the same time. If they can, the set is consistent. If not, it's inconsistent.

Since it's an indirect truth table approach, I think the method involves assuming that the set is inconsistent, which means at least one of the propositions must be false. Then, I try to derive a contradiction from that assumption. If I can derive a contradiction, the set is consistent; otherwise, it's inconsistent.

Wait, no, actually, the indirect method involves assuming the opposite of what we want and looking for a contradiction. So, if I assume that there's no consistent valuation, I look for a contradiction. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider all possible valuations and see if any make all propositions true.

But since there are four variables (A, B, C, D), there are 2^4 = 16 possible truth value combinations. That's a bit time-consuming, but maybe manageable.

Alternatively, I can try to find a valuation that satisfies all four propositions. Let me see if I can find such a valuation by testing some options.

Looking at the options, each suggests a particular valuation. So perhaps I can check each option's valuation against the four propositions to see if they hold.

Let me start by understanding each proposition:

1. A implies (~B or C). So, if A is true, then either B is false or C is true.
2. C implies D. So if C is true, D must be true.
3. A or (B and not D). So either A is true, or both B is true and D is false.
4. A is equivalent to (B implies D). So A is true if and only if B implies D. Which means, if B implies D, then A is true, and vice versa.

Hmm. Let me try to find a valuation where all four are true.

Let's consider option B: all variables are false.

So A=F, B=F, C=F, D=F.

Check each proposition:

1. A ⊃ (~B ∨ C): F ⊃ (T ∨ F) = F ⊃ T = T. So this holds.
2. C ⊃ D: F ⊃ F = T. Holds.
3. A ∨ (B · ~D): F ∨ (F · T) = F ∨ F = F. Wait, that's F, but proposition 3 is A or (B and ~D). So if A is F, B is F, D is F, so ~D is T. So B and ~D is F ∧ T = F. So A ∨ (B·~D) is F ∨ F = F. But proposition 3 is supposed to be true. So this valuation makes proposition 3 false. So option B's valuation doesn't satisfy all propositions. So option B is incorrect.

Wait, so option B says it's consistent and the valuation is all false. But that makes proposition 3 false. So the set would be inconsistent if that's the case. Wait, but I'm supposed to check if the set is consistent. So perhaps the set is consistent, but option B's valuation is wrong. So I need to find another valuation.

Let me try option F: C and D are true, A and B are false.

So A=F, B=F, C=T, D=T.

Check each proposition:

1. A ⊃ (~B ∨ C): F ⊃ (T ∨ T) = T. Holds.
2. C ⊃ D: T ⊃ T = T. Holds.
3. A ∨ (B · ~D): F ∨ (F · F) = F ∨ F = F. So proposition 3 is false here. So this valuation doesn't work either.

Wait, so proposition 3 is A ∨ (B ∧ ~D). So if A is F, then (B ∧ ~D) must be T for the whole proposition to be T. But in this case, B is F and D is T, so ~D is F. So B ∧ ~D is F ∧ F = F. So A ∨ (F) = F. So proposition 3 is F. So option F's valuation doesn't work.

Next, option E: B, C, D are T, A is F.

So A=F, B=T, C=T, D=T.

Check each proposition:

1. A ⊃ (~B ∨ C): F ⊃ (F ∨ T) = T. Holds.
2. C ⊃ D: T ⊃ T = T. Holds.
3. A ∨ (B · ~D): F ∨ (T · F) = F ∨ F = F. So proposition 3 is F. Doesn't work.

Hmm, same issue as before. So maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me try a different approach.

Let me consider the fourth proposition: A ≡ (B ⊃ D). Let's rewrite that. Since B ⊃ D is equivalent to ~B ∨ D. So A ≡ (~B ∨ D). So when A is true, ~B ∨ D must be true, and vice versa.

Now, let's look at proposition 1: A ⊃ (~B ∨ C). So if A is true, then ~B ∨ C must be true.

Proposition 2: C ⊃ D. So if C is true, D must be true.

Proposition 3: A ∨ (B · ~D). So either A is true, or both B and ~D are true. But if B and ~D are both true, that would mean D is false. But from proposition 2, if C is true, D is true. So if B and ~D are both true, then D is false, which would mean C must be false because C implies D. So if C is false, then D can be either T or F, but in this case, D is F because ~D is T.

Wait, this is getting a bit tangled. Maybe I should try to find a valuation where all four propositions are true.

Let me try a case where A is true.

If A is T, then from proposition 1, ~B ∨ C must be T. So either B is F or C is T.

From proposition 4, since A is T, then ~B ∨ D must be T. So either B is F or D is T.

From proposition 2, if C is T, then D must be T. So if C is T, D is T.

Proposition 3: A ∨ (B · ~D). Since A is T, this is automatically T.

So let's consider A=T.

Case 1: A=T, B=F.

From proposition 1: ~B is T, so ~B∨C is T regardless of C.

From proposition 4: ~B is T, so ~B∨D is T regardless of D.

Now, proposition 2: If C=T, then D=T. If C=F, D can be anything.

Proposition 3 is already satisfied because A=T.

So let's try A=T, B=F, C=F, D=F.

Check each proposition:

1. T ⊃ (T ∨ F) = T.
2. F ⊃ F = T.
3. T ∨ (F · T) = T.
4. T ≡ (F ⊃ F). F ⊃ F is T, so T ≡ T = T.

So all propositions are true in this case. So this is a consistent valuation. So the set is consistent, and this valuation is when A=T, B=F, C=F, D=F.

Wait, but looking at the options, which one matches this?

Looking at the options:

Option G: A, B, D are T, C=F.

Wait, no, in this case, A=T, B=F, C=F, D=F. So none of the options directly state this, but let me check.

Option B: all variables F. That didn't work earlier.

Option F: C and D=T, A and B=F. Which didn't work because proposition 3 failed.

Wait, but the valuation I found is A=T, B=F, C=F, D=F. Let me see if any option describes this.

Looking through the options:

Option G: A, B, D=T, C=F. No, because B=T in option G, but here B=F.

Option H: A, B, C=T, D=F. No.

Option C: A and D=T, B=F, C=F. Yes! Option C says: A and D are true, B and C are false.

So in that case, let's check again:

A=T, B=F, C=F, D=T.

Wait, in my earlier case, D=F. So that's conflicting.

Wait, in my case, D=F, but option C says D=T. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, in my case, when A=T, B=F, C=F, D=F.

But let me check proposition 2: C=F implies D can be anything. So D=F is allowed.

But then, in that case, let's check the fourth proposition: A ≡ (B ⊃ D). So A=T, and B ⊃ D is F ⊃ F, which is T. So T ≡ T = T. So that's okay.

So the valuation A=T, B=F, C=F, D=F is consistent.

Looking at the options, is there an option that states this? Let me check each option:

Option C: A and D=T, B and C=F.

Wait, no, because in my case, D=F. So option C is different.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in choosing D=F. Let me see if D can be T.

If I set D=T, then from proposition 2, C can be T or F, but in this case, C=F, so D can be T regardless.

Wait, let me try A=T, B=F, C=F, D=T.

Check each proposition:

1. A ⊃ (~B ∨ C) → T ⊃ (T ∨ F) = T.
2. C ⊃ D → F ⊃ T = T.
3. A ∨ (B · ~D) → T ∨ (F · F) = T.
4. A ≡ (B ⊃ D) → T ≡ (F ⊃ T) → T ≡ T → T.

So this also works. So A=T, B=F, C=F, D=T is also a consistent valuation.

Looking at the options, option C says: A and D=T, B and C=F. So that matches this case. So option C is a correct consistent valuation.

Wait, but earlier I thought that when D=T, the valuation would satisfy all propositions, but when I tried D=F, it also worked. So perhaps there are multiple consistent valuations.

But the question says that if the set is consistent, choose an option with a consistent valuation, noting that there may be others.

So looking at the options, option C is one such consistent valuation.

Let me check if any other options are correct. For example, option F says C and D=T, A and B=F.

Wait, let's test that: A=F, B=F, C=T, D=T.

Check proposition 1: F ⊃ (~F ∨ T) → F ⊃ T → T.

Proposition 2: T ⊃ T → T.

Proposition 3: F ∨ (F ∧ F) → F ∨ F → F. So proposition 3 is F, which makes the set inconsistent under this valuation. So option F is incorrect.

Similarly, option E: B, C, D=T, A=F.

Check:

Proposition 3: F ∨ (T ∧ F) → F ∨ F → F. So again, proposition 3 is F. So option E is incorrect.

Option G: A, B, D=T, C=F.

So A=T, B=T, C=F, D=T.

Check each proposition:

1. T ⊃ (~T ∨ F) → T ⊃ (F ∨ F) → T ⊃ F → F. So proposition 1 is F, which makes the set inconsistent. So option G is incorrect.

Option H: A, B, C=T, D=F.

Check proposition 2: C=T implies D=T. But D=F here. So proposition 2 is F. So option H is incorrect.

Option I: A, C, D=T, B=F.

So A=T, B=F, C=T, D=T.

Check proposition 1: T ⊃ (~F ∨ T) → T ⊃ (T ∨ T) → T.

Proposition 2: T ⊃ T → T.

Proposition 3: T ∨ (F ∧ F) → T ∨ F → T.

Proposition 4: A ≡ (B ⊃ D) → T ≡ (F ⊃ T) → T ≡ T → T.

So all propositions are true here. So this is another consistent valuation.

Looking at the options, option I says: Inconsistent. Inconsistent valuation when A, C, D=T and B=F. Wait, but in this case, all propositions are true, so the set is consistent, so option I is incorrect because it claims inconsistency.

Wait, option I says it's inconsistent because when A, C, D are T and B=F, the valuation is inconsistent. But in reality, that valuation makes all propositions true, so the set is consistent. So option I is wrong.

Option J: Inconsistent. So the set is inconsistent. But I found valuations where all propositions are true, so the set is consistent. So option J is incorrect.

Option A: Inconsistent. Inconsistent valuation when B and D are T, A and C are F.

So A=F, B=T, C=F, D=T.

Check proposition 1: F ⊃ (~T ∨ F) → F ⊃ (F ∨ F) → F ⊃ F → T.

Proposition 2: F ⊃ T → T.

Proposition 3: F ∨ (T ∧ F) → F ∨ F → F. So proposition 3 is F. So this valuation makes proposition 3 false, so the set is inconsistent under this valuation. But since there exists at least one valuation where all are true (like option C), the set is consistent overall. So option A is correct in saying it's inconsistent under that valuation, but the set is still consistent overall.

Option D: Inconsistent. Inconsistent valuation when all are T.

So A=T, B=T, C=T, D=T.

Check each proposition:

1. T ⊃ (~T ∨ T) → T ⊃ (F ∨ T) → T ⊃ T → T.

2. T ⊃ T → T.

3. T ∨ (T ∧ F) → T ∨ F → T.

4. A ≡ (B ⊃ D) → T ≡ (T ⊃ T) → T ≡ T → T.

So all propositions are true here. So option D is incorrect because it claims inconsistency when all are T, but in reality, the set is consistent under this valuation.

So, putting it all together, the set is consistent, and one of the consistent valuations is when A=T, B=F, C=F, D=T (option C). Alternatively, when A=T, B=F, C=F, D=F, which isn't listed as an option, but option C matches another valid case.

Therefore, the correct answer is option C: Consistent. Consistent valuation when A and D are true and B and C are false.
</think>

The set of propositions is consistent, as there exists at least one valuation where all propositions are true. One such consistent valuation is when A and D are true, and B and C are false.
