Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about the intensity of solar radiation and finding the amplitude of the electromagnetic waves at Earth's distance from the Sun. Hmm, alright, let's break it down step by step.

First, the problem states that the intensity of solar radiation at Earth's mean distance is 1.35 × 10³ J·m⁻²·s⁻¹. I remember that intensity (I) in electromagnetic waves is related to the amplitude (E) of the electric field and the magnetic field (B). The formula I think is I = (E²)/(2μ₀c), where μ₀ is the permeability of free space and c is the speed of light. Alternatively, I also recall that intensity can be expressed in terms of both E and B because they are related in EM waves.

Wait, another formula comes to mind: I = (c * ε₀ * E²)/2, since ε₀ is the permittivity of free space. Oh right, because E and B are related by E = cB. So maybe I can use that to find E.

Let me jot down the known values:
- Intensity, I = 1.35 × 10³ J/(m²·s)
- ε₀ (permittivity of free space) is approximately 8.85 × 10⁻¹² F/m
- c (speed of light) is about 3.00 × 10⁸ m/s

Wait, the question says if the radiation were all at one wavelength. That probably means it's a monochromatic wave, so it's a pure sinusoidal wave. For such waves, the intensity formula I = (E²)/(2μ₀c) applies, right? Or alternatively, I can use I = (2E²)/(cμ₀) because sometimes I get confused about the exact formula. Alternatively, since E and B are related, maybe using I = (E × B)/μ₀? Hmm, not sure.

Wait, I think the correct relation is I = (E^2)/(2μ₀c). Let me confirm. Intensity of an EM wave is given by I = (E^2)/(2μ₀c) = (c B²)/(2μ₀), and since E = cB, that makes sense. So yes, I'll use I = E²/(2μ₀c) to solve for E.

So rearranging the formula to solve for E: E = sqrt(2 * I * μ₀ * c)

Wait, no, wait. Let me do the algebra correctly. Let's see:

I = E²/(2μ₀c) → E² = 2μ₀ c I → E = sqrt(2 μ₀ c I)

Yes, that makes sense. So substituting the known values.

Plugging in the numbers:

μ₀ is 4π × 10⁻⁷ H/m. Let me compute that. 4π is approximately 12.566, so μ₀ ≈ 12.566 × 10⁻⁷ H/m.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, I'm confused. Because sometimes I see μ₀ as 4π×10⁻⁷ H/m. Yes, that's correct.

So let me compute 2 * μ₀ * c * I.

So 2 * μ₀ = 2 * 4π × 10⁻⁷ = 8π × 10⁻⁷ ≈ 25.133 × 10⁻⁷.

Wait, but maybe I should just compute it numerically.

Calculating each part:

2 * μ₀ = 2 * 4π × 10⁻⁷ = 8π × 10⁻⁷ H/m.

c is 3.00e8 m/s.

I is 1.35e3 J/(m²·s).

So 2 * μ₀ * c * I = (8π × 10⁻⁷) * (3.00e8) * (1.35e3)

Let me compute each step:

First, 8π ≈ 25.1327.

So 25.1327e-7 * 3e8 = 25.1327 * 3 * 1e1 = (75.3981) * 10 = 753.981.

Then multiply by I, 1.35e3:

753.981 * 1.35e3 = 753.981 * 1350.

Wait, let me compute that.

753.981 * 1000 = 753,981.

753.981 * 350 = ?

Well, 753.981 * 300 = 226,194.3.

753.981 * 50 = 37,699.05.

Total 226,194.3 + 37,699.05 = 263,893.35.

So 753,981 + 263,893.35 ≈ 1,017,874.35.

So 2 * μ₀ * c * I ≈ 1,017,874.35.

Then E = sqrt(1,017,874.35) ≈ ?

Let me compute sqrt(1,017,874.35). Hmm, 1009^2 is about 1,018,081, because 1000^2=1e6, 1010^2=1,020,100. Let me check 1009^2: (1000+9)^2 = 1000² + 2*1000*9 + 9² = 1e6 + 18,000 + 81 = 1,018,081. Which is a bit higher than 1,017,874. So maybe around 1008.9 or so.

Alternatively, compute approximately: Let me see, 1008^2 = (1000 +8)^2 = 1e6 + 16,000 + 64 = 1,016,064.

So 1,017,874 is between 1008² and 1009².

The difference between 1,017,874 and 1,016,064 is 1,810.

The total between 1008² and 1009² is 2,017 (1,018,081 - 1,016,064 = 2017).

So 1,810 / 2017 ≈ 0.897.

So approximate sqrt is 1008 + 0.897 ≈ 1008.897 V/m.

Wait, but wait! The options are in the order of 1e3 V/m, around 1.01e3, 1.00e3, etc. So 1008.9 V/m is approximately 1.01 × 10³ V/m, which matches option C: 1.01 × 10³ V·m⁻¹.

But wait, let me check my calculations again because sometimes I might have made a mistake in the multiplication.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating 2 * μ₀ * c * I.

Let me redo that part more carefully.

μ₀ = 4π × 10⁻⁷ H/m ≈ 12.566370614359172 × 10⁻⁷ H/m.

So 2 * μ₀ = 2 * 12.566370614359172e-7 ≈ 25.132741228718344e-7.

Then, multiply by c = 3e8 m/s:

25.132741228718344e-7 * 3e8 = 25.132741228718344 * 3 * 1e1 (because 1e-7 * 1e8 = 1e1).

25.132741228718344 * 3 = 75.39822368615503.

Multiply by 1e1: 753.9822368615503.

Now, multiply by I = 1.35e3:

753.9822368615503 * 1.35e3.

Which is 753.9822368615503 * 1350.

Let me compute 753.9822 * 1350.

Break it down:

753.9822 * 1000 = 753,982.2

753.9822 * 300 = 226,194.66

753.9822 * 50 = 37,699.11

Add them together:

753,982.2 + 226,194.66 = 980,176.86

980,176.86 + 37,699.11 = 1,017,875.97.

So 2 * μ₀ * c * I ≈ 1,017,875.97.

Now, sqrt(1,017,875.97) ≈ ?

I can compute sqrt(1,017,875.97) as follows.

We know that 1008^2 = 1,016,064.

1009^2 = 1,018,081.

Compute 1,017,875.97 - 1,016,064 = 1,811.97.

So the fraction is 1,811.97 / (1,018,081 - 1,016,064) = 1,811.97 / 2,017 ≈ 0.898.

So sqrt is approximately 1008 + 0.898 ≈ 1008.898 V/m.

Which is approximately 1.0089 × 10³ V/m, so about 1.01 × 10³ V/m, matching option C.

But wait, let me check if I used the correct formula. Because sometimes I might have mixed up the formula. Let me think again: intensity is I = E²/(2μ₀c), so E = sqrt(2 μ₀ c I). Did I compute that correctly?

Yes, 2 * μ₀ * c * I is under the square root.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have used E = sqrt(2 * I * μ₀ * c), which is the same as what I did.

Wait, another approach: I remember that the intensity can be expressed as I = (E^2)/(2μ₀c). So solving for E gives E = sqrt(2 μ₀ c I). So yes, that's correct.

Now, looking at the options, option C says 1.01 × 10³ V/m, which matches our calculation. But wait, let's check the other part of the option as well. The options also provide a magnetic field component or something else, like Wb/m², which is equivalent to Tesla. Wait, Wb/m² is Tesla, since Weber is T·m².

Wait, the second part of the options is labeled as Wb·m⁻², which is T. So the second value given in the options is the magnetic field B.

So, once we have E, we can find B using B = E/(c). Because in an EM wave, E and B are related by E = cB.

So B = E / c. Let's compute that.

E is approximately 1.0089e3 V/m.

So B = 1.0089e3 / 3e8 ≈ 3.363e-6 T.

Wait, 1e3 / 3e8 = (1/3) * 1e-5 = approximately 3.333e-6.

So 1.0089e3 /3e8 = (1.0089 /3) * 1e-5 ≈ 0.3363 * 1e-5 = 3.363e-6 T.

Which is 3.363 × 10⁻⁶ Wb/m² (since 1 T = 1 Wb/m²).

Looking at the options, option C says 3.37 × 10⁻⁶ Wb/m², which matches our calculation.

So putting it together, the amplitude of E is approximately 1.01 × 10³ V/m and B is 3.37 × 10⁻⁶ Wb/m², which is option C.

To determine the amplitude of the electromagnetic waves from the sun at Earth's distance, we use the intensity formula for an electromagnetic wave: 

\[
I = \frac{E^2}{2\mu_0 c}
\]

where \( I \) is the intensity, \( E \) is the electric field amplitude, \( \mu_0 \) is the permeability of free space (\( 4\pi \times 10^{-7} \, \text{H/m} \)), and \( c \) is the speed of light (\( 3.00 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \)).

Rearranging for \( E \):

\[
E = \sqrt{2 \mu_0 c I}
\]

Substituting the given values:
- \( I = 1.35 \times 10^3 \, \text{J/m}^2\text{s} \),
- \( \mu_0 = 4\pi \times 10^{-7} \, \text{H/m} \),
- \( c = 3.00 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \),

we calculate:

\[
E = \sqrt{2 \cdot (4\pi \times 10^{-7}) \cdot (3.00 \times 10^8) \cdot (1.35 \times 10^3)}
\]

First, compute \( 2 \cdot \mu_0 \cdot c \cdot I \):

\[
2 \cdot \mu_0 = 8\pi \times 10^{-7} \approx 25.133 \times 10^{-7}
\]
\[
25.133 \times 10^{-7} \cdot 3.00 \times 10^8 = 753.981
\]
\[
753.981 \cdot 1.35 \times 10^3 = 1,017,875.97
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
E = \sqrt{1,017,875.97} \approx 1.0089 \times 10^3 \, \text{V/m}
\]

This rounds to \( 1.01 \times 10^3 \, \text{V/m} \).

The magnetic field \( B \) is related to \( E \) by \( B = \frac{E}{c} \):

\[
B = \frac{1.0089 \times 10^3}{3.00 \times 10^8} \approx 3.363 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{T}
\]

Since \( 1 \, \text{T} = 1 \, \text{Wb/m}^2 \), \( B \approx 3.37 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{Wb/m}^2 \).

Thus, the amplitude of the electromagnetic waves is \( 1.01 \times 10^3 \, \text{V/m} \) and \( 3.37 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{Wb/m}^2 \), matching **option C**.
