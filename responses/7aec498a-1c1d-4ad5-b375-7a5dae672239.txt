Question:

How has the role of internal body secretions in behavior been demonstrated in silk worms?

Options:

Okay, so I've got this question about silk worms and their behavior, specifically about internal body secretions. Hmm, internal secretions would relate to hormones or something like that, right? I remember that hormones can influence behavior in various animals, including insects.

The question is asking how the role of internal body secretions has been demonstrated in silk worms. The options are A through J. Let me go through each option to see which one fits.

Option A says they spin based on the moon phase. That sounds more like an external stimulus, not internal secretions. Probably not the right choice.

Option B is about external stimuli controlling behavior. But the question is about internal secretions, so B might not be it.

Option C mentions spinning only with light. Again, that's an external factor, not internal.

Option D says based on age. Age could relate to internal changes, but I'm not sure if that's the direct link to secretions.

Option E is about vibrations. That's another external factor, so probably not.

Option F talks about diet triggering spinning. Diet is an external factor, but maybe it affects hormones? Not sure yet.

Option G is about temperature changes. External again, so maybe not.

Option H states they spin when juvenile hormone levels are high. Juvenile hormones are internal, so this seems relevant. High levels might signal a certain developmental stage.

Option I says cocoon spinning is controlled by hormones. That's a broad statement but aligns with internal secretions.

Option J claims it's a learned behavior. But spinning a cocoon is instinctive, not learned. So J is probably incorrect.

Now, the question is about demonstrating the role of internal secretions. So both H and I talk about hormones. H is more specific about juvenile hormones being high, while I is a general statement about hormones controlling behavior.

I think the key here is that juvenile hormones are known to regulate certain behaviors in insects, like metamorphosis. So when the level of juvenile hormone is high, the silk worm might be in a certain phase, leading them to spin cocoons. So H seems correct.

Alternatively, I could be correct because it directly mentions hormones controlling the behavior. But the question asks how it's demonstrated. Maybe the study showed that when juvenile hormone levels are high, they spin, so it's the specific cause.

Wait, another thought: I remember that in insects, the transition from larva to pupa is controlled by hormones. Specifically, juvenile hormones. When they stop being produced, the insect starts to pupate. So in the case of silk worms, when the juvenile hormone levels drop, they stop eating and start spinning their cocoon. Or wait, maybe when they're high, they continue feeding, and when they drop, they stop and spin. So perhaps the spinning is triggered when the hormone levels are high, but I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, maybe the presence of juvenile hormone is required for the larval stage, and when it decreases, they enter the prepupal stage, which leads to cocoon spinning. So if the level is high, they don't spin yet. So H says 'when they sense vibrations'â€”no, that's E. H says when juvenile hormone levels are high. So if the level is high, they don't spin; maybe when it's low, they do. So maybe H is incorrect.

Wait, but the question is about demonstrating the role. Maybe the study showed that when you manipulate the hormone levels, the behavior changes. So perhaps when juvenile hormone is present, they don't spin, but when it's absent, they do. So the spinning is triggered when the hormone levels are not high. Hmm, but the option says 'when they are high'.

Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is I: that the behavior is controlled by hormones. Because regardless of the specific timing, the hormones do control it. So I could be the broader statement that's correct, even if H is more specific but possibly incorrect.

Wait, but the question is about demonstrating the role, so the mechanism. So the correct answer is likely I or H. I think H is more precise, assuming that high levels trigger it, but maybe it's the opposite. I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is I because it's the broader statement about hormones, which are internal secretions.

The question focuses on how internal body secretions, specifically hormones, influence the behavior of silk worms, particularly their cocoon-spinning behavior. Among the options, H and I are the most relevant as they pertain to hormones. Option H suggests that spinning occurs when juvenile hormone levels are high, while I states that the behavior is controlled by hormones. Juvenile hormones are known to regulate developmental stages in insects, and their levels dropping typically trigger the transition to the pupal stage, leading to cocoon spinning. Therefore, while H is specific, it may not accurately reflect the timing of the behavior. Option I, however, broadly and correctly attributes the behavior to hormones, aligning with the role of internal secretions. 

The answer is I.
