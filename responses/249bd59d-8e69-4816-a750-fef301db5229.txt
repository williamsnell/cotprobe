Okay, so I've got this chemistry question here, and I need to figure out which molecule has an octet of electrons around the central atom. The options are A through E: BF3, BeF2, PF5, NH4+, and SF6.

Hmm, I remember that the octet rule says that atoms tend to have eight electrons in their valence shell, like noble gases. So the central atom in each molecule should have eight electrons around it.

Let me think about each option one by one.

Option A: BF3. Boron usually has three valence electrons. Each fluorine brings one electron for bonding. So BF3 has a trigonal planar shape. The boron is bonded to three F atoms. Each bond is a pair of electrons. So boron has 3 bonds × 2 electrons each = 6 electrons. But wait, boron can sometimes have an expanded octet? No, in BF3, boron is only making three bonds, so it has 6 electrons. That's not an octet. So A probably doesn't have an octet.

Option B: BeF2. Beryllium usually has two valence electrons. Each F brings one, so BeF2 has two bonds. Each bond is two electrons, so Be has 4 electrons. That's only four, so definitely not an octet. So B is out.

Option C: PF5. Phosphorus has five valence electrons. Each F brings one, so five bonds. Each bond is two electrons, so 5 × 2 = 10 electrons. Wait, that's more than eight. But wait, does phosphorus expand its octet here? I think phosphorus can have an expanded octet because it's in period 3, so it can have more than eight electrons. So PF5 would have 10 electrons around P, but the question is about an octet. Hmm, maybe the question is looking for exactly eight, so C might not be the answer.

Option D: NH4+. Nitrogen has five valence electrons normally. In NH4+, nitrogen is bonded to four H atoms. Each bond is two electrons, so 4 × 2 = 8 electrons. Plus, since it's NH4+, it has a positive charge, which means it lost an electron. Wait, but the central nitrogen's valence electrons: normally 5, but in the ion, it's lost one electron. So 5 - 1 = 4? No, wait, maybe I should calculate it differently. The Lewis structure for NH4+ has nitrogen with four single bonds to H and a positive charge, meaning it has 8 electrons around it. Because each bond is two electrons, four bonds make 8. So the central atom (N) has eight electrons. So D might be the correct answer.

Option E: SF6. Sulfur has six valence electrons. Each F brings one, so six bonds. Each bond is two electrons, so 6 × 2 = 12 electrons around S. But sulfur can expand its octet, so having 12 is possible. But again, the question is about having an octet, which is eight, so E has more than that. So E isn't the answer.

Wait, let me double-check. So the question is which has exactly eight electrons around the central atom. So D: NH4+ has eight electrons because each of the four H atoms contributes one electron, so four bonds × 2 = 8. Yes, that makes sense. So the correct answer is D.

The correct answer is D: NH4+. 

In NH4+, the nitrogen atom is bonded to four hydrogen atoms, forming four single bonds. Each bond contributes two electrons, resulting in a total of 8 electrons around the nitrogen atom. This satisfies the octet rule, making NH4+ the molecule with an octet of electrons around the central atom.

Answer: D
