Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

The problem says a 1000-gram metal block falls through a distance of 10 meters. All the energy goes into heat. I need to find out how many units of heat energy appeared. The options are given in calories, so I guess I need to calculate the energy in calories.

First, I remember that when an object falls, it gains gravitational potential energy, which converts into kinetic energy when it hits the ground. But here, all that energy is converted into heat. So I need to calculate the potential energy loss and then convert that into heat energy.

Gravitational potential energy (PE) is calculated using the formula PE = m * g * h, where m is mass, g is acceleration due to gravity, and h is height.

Wait, the mass is given in grams. I think I need to convert that to kilograms because the standard unit for mass in physics formulas is kilograms. So 1000 grams is 1 kilogram. Okay, that's easy.

Gravity (g) is approximately 9.8 m/s². The height (h) is 10 meters. So plugging those numbers into the formula: PE = 1 kg * 9.8 m/s² * 10 m.

Let me calculate that. 1 times 9.8 is 9.8, times 10 is 98. So the potential energy is 98 joules. Since all of this energy is converted into heat, the heat energy (Q) is also 98 joules.

But wait, the options are in calories, not joules. I remember that 1 calorie is approximately 4.184 joules. So I need to convert 98 joules into calories.

To convert joules to calories, I divide by the number of joules per calorie. So Q = 98 J / 4.184 J/cal. Let me do that calculation.

Dividing 98 by 4.184. Let's see, 4.184 times 23 is about 96.232. Then 4.184 times 23.5 is 4.184 * 20=83.68, 4.184*3=12.552, so 83.68+12.552=96.232, plus 0.5 *4.184=2.092, so total 96.232 +2.092=98.324. Hmm, so 23.5 calories would be approximately 98.324 J. But our Q is 98 J, which is just a tiny bit less. So maybe approximately 23.5 calories? Wait, but let me check the calculation again.

Wait, 98 divided by 4.184. Let me compute it more accurately. 4.184 goes into 98 how many times? 

4.184 * 23 = 96.232. Subtract that from 98, we get 1.768 left. 1.768 /4.184 is about 0.422. So total is approximately 23.422 calories. So around 23.42 calories. Looking at the options, option F is 23.5 cal. That's really close. So the answer should be F.

Wait, but let me double-check. Another way: 1 calorie is about 4.184 J, so 23.5 calories would be 23.5 *4.184 = 98.324 J. Yep, which matches our calculation of 98 J. So the heat energy is approximately 23.5 calories. So the correct answer is F.

The problem involves calculating the heat energy generated when a 1000-gram metal block falls 10 meters, with all the energy converted into heat. Using the formula for gravitational potential energy (PE = m * g * h), where m = 1 kg, g = 9.8 m/s², and h = 10 m, the potential energy is 98 joules. Converting this to calories (1 calorie ≈ 4.184 joules) gives approximately 23.5 calories. Thus, the correct answer is F.

Answer: F
