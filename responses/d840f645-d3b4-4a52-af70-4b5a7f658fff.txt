Answer:
    
<think>
Okay, so I've got this problem here where an investor is depositing $1000 in an account that gives 8% interest compounded monthly. Plus, they're adding $25 each month. I need to find out how much the balance will be after three years. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that compound interest can be calculated with the formula A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where P is the principal, r is the annual interest rate, n is the number of times interest is compounded per year, t is the time in years, and A is the amount after time t.

But wait, in this case, there are additional monthly deposits. So it's not just a simple compound interest problem; it's more like a future value of an annuity due to those monthly contributions. Right, so I think I'll need to use the future value formula for an ordinary annuity since the deposits are made at the end of each month.

The formula for the future value of an ordinary annuity is FV = PMT * [(1 + r/n)^(nt) - 1] / (r/n), where PMT is the monthly payment. Then, I'll also need to calculate the future value of the initial deposit using the compound interest formula and add them together.

Let me break it down step by step.

The initial principal is $1000. The annual interest rate is 8%, so r = 0.08. Since it's compounded monthly, n = 12. The time is 3 years, so t = 3. So for the initial deposit, the future value would be:

A = 1000 * (1 + 0.08/12)^(12*3)

Let me calculate that part first. 0.08 divided by 12 is approximately 0.0066667. So 1 + 0.0066667 is about 1.0066667. Then, 12*3 is 36. So I need to raise 1.0066667 to the 36th power.

I'll estimate that. Let me recall that (1 + r)^n ≈ e^(rn) when r is small, but maybe I should just compute it step by step or use logarithms. Alternatively, I can remember that 1.0066667^36 is roughly around... Let's see, 1.0066667^12 is about 1.083, because 8% annual rate, so monthly it's 0.66667% per month, and after a year, it's about 8.3% growth. So for 3 years, it's (1.083)^3. Wait, but that's the effective annual rate. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute 1.0066667^36.

Using a calculator, 1.0066667^36 ≈ 1.265319. So, A ≈ 1000 * 1.265319 ≈ $1265.32.

Wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, 8% over three years would give a much higher amount. Wait, 1000 at 8% for three years compounded monthly: let me recalculate that.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula more accurately. Let me compute (1 + 0.08/12)^36.

0.08 divided by 12 is approximately 0.006666667. So each month's multiplier is 1.006666667.

Now, let's compute this step by step. Let me use logarithms or natural exponentials to compute 1.006666667^36.

Alternatively, I can use the formula for compound interest: A = P(1 + i)^n, where i is the monthly rate and n is the number of months.

So, A = 1000*(1.006666667)^36.

Calculating (1.006666667)^36:

I can use the formula ln(1.006666667) ≈ 0.0066445. Then, 36 * 0.0066445 ≈ 0.2392. Then, e^0.2392 ≈ 1.2707. So, A ≈ 1000 * 1.2707 ≈ $1270.70.

Wait, that's a bit more precise. So the initial deposit grows to around $1270.70 after 3 years.

Now, for the monthly deposits of $25. So the future value of these deposits is an annuity. The formula for the future value of an ordinary annuity is FV = PMT * [(1 + r/n)^(nt) - 1]/(r/n).

Here, PMT = 25, r = 0.08, n =12, t=3, so nt=36.

So, plugging in the numbers:

FV = 25 * [(1 + 0.08/12)^36 - 1]/(0.08/12)

We already calculated (1 + 0.08/12)^36 as approximately 1.2707.

So, 1.2707 - 1 = 0.2707.

Divided by (0.08/12) which is 0.006666667.

So, 0.2707 / 0.006666667 ≈ 40.605.

Then, FV ≈ 25 * 40.605 ≈ 1015.13.

Wait, but that seems a bit high. Let me check the calculation again.

Wait, (1.006666667)^36 is approximately 1.2707, as I had before.

So, subtracting 1 gives 0.2707.

Divide by 0.006666667: 0.2707 / 0.006666667 ≈ 40.605.

Multiply by 25: 25 * 40.605 ≈ 1015.13.

So the future value of the monthly deposits is approximately $1015.13.

Now, adding the future value of the initial deposit and the future value of the monthly deposits:

Total balance = 1270.70 + 1015.13 ≈ $2285.83.

Hmm, looking at the options, option G is $2283.63, which is close to this estimate. The slight difference might be due to rounding during calculations.

Wait, let me double-check the calculations for more precision.

First, let's compute (1 + 0.08/12)^36 more accurately.

Using a calculator, 0.08/12 = 0.0066666667.

Let me compute (1.0066666667)^36:

Using logarithms:

ln(1.0066666667) ≈ 0.006644514.

Multiply by 36: 0.006644514 * 36 ≈ 0.2392025.

Exponentiate: e^0.2392025 ≈ 1.270708.

So, A = 1000 * 1.270708 ≈ $1270.71.

Now, for the annuity:

FV = 25 * [(1.270708 - 1) / (0.0066666667)].

So, 1.270708 - 1 = 0.270708.

0.270708 / 0.0066666667 ≈ 40.6062.

25 * 40.6062 ≈ 1015.155.

So total balance is 1270.71 + 1015.155 ≈ $2285.87.

Hmm, the options don't have exactly this number. The closest option is G: $2283.63, which is a bit lower. Maybe I made a slight error in the exponent calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps using a different method, such as the future value of each monthly deposit.

Alternatively, maybe I should compute it more precisely using the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the monthly deposits are being compounded each month, so their future value can be calculated as the sum of each monthly payment multiplied by (1 + r)^k, where k is the number of months remaining until the end.

So, for each monthly deposit of $25, the first deposit is made at the end of month 1, so it earns interest for 35 months, the second for 34 months, etc., down to the last deposit which earns 0 months of interest.

So the future value of each deposit would be 25*(1.006666667)^35 + 25*(1.006666667)^34 + ... + 25*(1.006666667)^0.

This is a geometric series, and the sum can be found using the formula for the future value of an ordinary annuity, which I used earlier.

But perhaps I need to calculate it more accurately.

Let me compute the factor [(1.006666667)^36 - 1]/0.006666667.

Using a calculator, (1.006666667)^36 is approximately 1.270708.

So, 1.270708 - 1 = 0.270708.

Divide by 0.006666667: 0.270708 / 0.006666667 ≈ 40.6062.

So, 25 * 40.6062 ≈ 1015.155.

Adding to the initial deposit's future value of $1270.71, total is $2285.865, which is approximately $2285.87.

Looking at the options, G is $2283.63, which is close but not exactly the same. Maybe I should check if I made a mistake in the exponent calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the exact formula without approximations.

Let me compute (1 + 0.08/12)^(12*3) precisely.

Using a calculator: 0.08/12 = 0.00666666667.

(1.00666666667)^36.

Using a calculator function, this is approximately 1.2707084.

So, FV of initial deposit: 1000 * 1.2707084 = 1270.7084.

Now, for the annuity:

FV = 25 * [ (1.00666666667)^36 - 1 ] / 0.00666666667.

We have (1.00666666667)^36 = 1.2707084.

So, 1.2707084 - 1 = 0.2707084.

Divide by 0.00666666667: 0.2707084 / 0.00666666667 = 40.606206.

Multiply by 25: 25 * 40.606206 = 1015.15515.

So, total balance is 1270.7084 + 1015.15515 = 2285.86355, approximately $2285.86.

But the options don't have this exact amount. The closest is option G: $2283.63. Hmm, perhaps I made an error in the calculation.

Wait, maybe I should use more precise intermediate steps. Alternatively, perhaps the monthly contributions are being compounded differently.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for the future value of a series of monthly deposits, considering each deposit earns interest for a certain number of months.

Alternatively, maybe using a financial calculator approach.

Another approach is to use the future value formula for each payment:

FV = 25 * sum_{k=1 to 36} (1 + 0.08/12)^{36 - k}.

But that's the same as the annuity formula, which I used earlier.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the factor more accurately.

Let me compute [(1.00666666667)^36 - 1] / 0.00666666667.

Calculating numerator: 1.2707084 - 1 = 0.2707084.

Denominator: 0.00666666667.

0.2707084 / 0.00666666667 ≈ 40.606206.

So, 25 * 40.606206 = 1015.15515.

Adding the initial deposit's FV: 1270.7084 + 1015.15515 ≈ 2285.86355.

Hmm, but the options don't have this. Maybe I should check if the initial deposit is compounded monthly for 3 years, and the monthly deposits start at the end of each month.

Wait, perhaps the initial deposit is compounded monthly, but the monthly deposits are starting immediately, making it an annuity due. But the problem says the investor makes additional deposits of $25 per month, but it doesn't specify if they're made at the beginning or end. Usually, it's assumed to be end of the period, so ordinary annuity.

Wait, perhaps I should use a more precise calculation method.

Alternatively, perhaps using the formula for the future value of an ordinary annuity with monthly contributions.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula: FV = PMT * ((1 + r)^n - 1)/r, where r is the periodic rate.

In this case, r = 0.08/12 ≈ 0.006666667, n=36.

So, FV = 25 * ((1.006666667)^36 -1)/0.006666667.

As before, that's 25 * (0.2707084)/0.006666667 ≈ 25*40.606206 ≈1015.155.

So, same result.

Adding to the initial FV: 1270.7084 +1015.155 = 2285.8634.

But the options don't have this; the closest is G: 2283.63.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, maybe I should use a financial calculator approach or check the options again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial FV calculation. Let me recalculate the initial deposit's FV.

A = 1000*(1 + 0.08/12)^(36).

Using a calculator, 0.08/12=0.006666667.

(1.006666667)^36=1.2707084.

So, 1000*1.2707084=1270.7084.

That seems correct.

Now, for the annuity: 25 * [(1.006666667)^36 -1]/0.006666667.

Which is 25 * (0.2707084)/0.006666667.

0.2707084 / 0.006666667 = 40.606206.

25*40.606206=1015.15515.

Total: 1270.7084 + 1015.15515=2285.86355.

Hmm, but the options don't have exactly this. The closest is G:2283.63, which is about $2283.63, a bit less than my calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the exponent. Let me check (1.006666667)^36 precisely.

Using a calculator, 1.006666667^36.

Let me compute it step by step:

1.006666667^1 = 1.006666667

^2 = 1.006666667 * 1.006666667 ≈ 1.013377778

^3 ≈ 1.013377778 * 1.006666667 ≈ 1.02013889

^35≈1.29950963 *1.006666667≈1.31103216

^36≈1.31103216 *1.006666667≈1.32274004

Wait, wait, that can't be right because earlier I thought it was around 1.27, but now after step-by-step calculation, I'm getting 1.3227 after 36 months. That's a discrepancy. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the step-by-step calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the multiplication steps. Let me check a few points.

At step 12, I had 1.08572370, which seems correct for 12 months at 8% compounded monthly.

Then, for step 24, after 24 months, it's 1.08572370 * (1.006666667)^12 again, which would be (1.08572370) * (1.08572370) ≈ 1.08572370^2 ≈ 1.178544. But I had 1.19347454 at step 24, which is higher than 1.178544. So perhaps I made a mistake in the step-by-step calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps using a different approach. Let me use logarithms again.

ln(1.006666667) ≈ 0.0066445.

Multiply by 36: 0.239202.

Exponentiate: e^0.239202 ≈ 1.2707.

So, the correct value after 36 months is approximately 1.2707, not 1.3227 as I mistakenly calculated step by step. So I must have made a mistake in the step-by-step approach, perhaps in the multiplications.

So, going back, the initial deposit's future value is 1000 * 1.2707 ≈ 1270.70.

The annuity's future value is 25 * 40.6062 ≈ 1015.155.

Total balance: 1270.70 + 1015.155 ≈ 2285.855.

But the options don't have this. The closest is G: $2283.63.

Wait, perhaps the options are rounded. Let me check the exact calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the monthly contributions are treated as starting at the beginning of each month, making it an annuity due, which would increase the future value.

Wait, the problem says the investor makes additional deposits of $25 per month. It doesn't specify when, but usually, if not specified, it's assumed to be at the end, so ordinary annuity.

But if it were an annuity due, each payment would earn an extra month's interest. So the future value would be higher. But that's probably not the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use more precise decimal places in the calculations.

Let me try recalculating the annuity factor with more precision.

[(1.006666667)^36 - 1] / 0.006666667.

We know (1.006666667)^36 = 1.2707084.

So, 1.2707084 - 1 = 0.2707084.

Divide by 0.006666667:

0.2707084 / 0.006666667 = 40.606206.

So, 25 * 40.606206 = 1015.15515.

Adding to initial FV: 1270.7084 + 1015.15515 = 2285.86355.

Hmm, but the options don't include this. Wait, looking back at the options, perhaps I misread them.

The options are:

A: $3200.67

B: $2050.89

C: $2100.45

D: $1950.32

E: $3000.59

F: $2500.00

G: $2283.63

H: $2750.48

I: $2600.25

J: $1800.75

So, the closest to my calculation is G: $2283.63, which is about $2 less than my calculated $2285.86. So perhaps the exact calculation using precise decimal places would result in $2283.63. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the initial FV calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the monthly contributions are compounded starting from the first month, so the first contribution earns interest for 35 months, not 36. Let me check that.

Wait, if the first contribution is made at the end of the first month, it will be in the account for 35 months. The last contribution is made at the end of the 36th month, so it doesn't earn any interest. So the number of periods each payment earns is from 1 to 35 months.

Wait, but in the annuity formula, we use n periods, which is 36. So the formula should be correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the future value function on a financial calculator.

Let me try that approach.

For the initial deposit:

FV = 1000*(1 + 0.08/12)^36 ≈ 1000*1.270708 ≈ 1270.71.

For the monthly deposits:

Using the future value of an ordinary annuity formula.

Number of periods (n) = 36.

Periodic payment (PMT) = 25.

Periodic rate (i) = 0.08/12 ≈ 0.006666667.

Compute the future value:

FV = PMT * [(1 + i)^n - 1]/i.

So, FV = 25 * [(1.006666667)^36 - 1]/0.006666667.

As before, this is 25*(0.2707084)/0.006666667 ≈ 25*40.606206 ≈1015.155.

Total FV: 1270.71 + 1015.155 = 2285.865.

But the closest option is G:2283.63. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should use more precise decimal places in the (1.006666667)^36 calculation.

Using a calculator, 1.006666667^36 is approximately 1.2707084.

So, 25 * [ (1.2707084 - 1) / 0.006666667 ] = 25 * (0.2707084 / 0.006666667) = 25 * 40.606206 ≈ 1015.155.

Adding to 1270.71 gives 2285.865.

Wait, but perhaps the options are rounded to the nearest cent, so perhaps the precise calculation would give exactly $2283.63. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved using simple interest, but that doesn't seem right because it's compounded monthly.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the monthly contributions are being added before the interest is applied each month. So, for each month, you add $25, then apply the interest. That would make the deposits grow more, but I think that's how it's supposed to work.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for the future value of a series of monthly deposits, which is what I did.

Wait, perhaps the options have a typo, or perhaps I should accept that the closest option is G: $2283.63.

Alternatively, perhaps I should check another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the total amount is $2283.63, which would be option G.
</think>

The problem involves calculating the future value of an initial deposit and a series of monthly contributions with compound interest. The initial deposit of $1000 earns 8% annual interest, compounded monthly, and the investor adds $25 each month. The goal is to find the balance after 3 years.

First, the future value of the initial deposit is calculated using the compound interest formula:
\[ A = P \left(1 + \frac{r}{n}\right)^{nt} \]
where \( P = 1000 \), \( r = 0.08 \), \( n = 12 \), and \( t = 3 \). This results in:
\[ A = 1000 \times (1 + 0.0066667)^{36} \approx 1000 \times 1.270708 \approx 1270.71 \]

Next, the future value of the monthly contributions is calculated using the future value of an ordinary annuity formula:
\[ FV = PMT \times \frac{(1 + \frac{r}{n})^{nt} - 1}{\frac{r}{n}} \]
where \( PMT = 25 \), \( r = 0.08 \), \( n = 12 \), and \( t = 3 \). This results in:
\[ FV = 25 \times \frac{(1.0066667)^{36} - 1}{0.0066667} \approx 25 \times 40.6062 \approx 1015.16 \]

Adding the future values of the initial deposit and the monthly contributions gives:
\[ \text{Total Balance} \approx 1270.71 + 1015.16 \approx 2285.87 \]

However, the closest option provided is **G: $2283.63**, which is slightly lower than the calculated amount. This discrepancy may be due to rounding differences in intermediate steps or the options provided.

Answer: G
