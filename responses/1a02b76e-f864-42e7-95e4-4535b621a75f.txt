Okay, so I've got this math problem here. It says that two numbers add up to 19 and their product is 70. I need to find which pair from the options A to J fits these conditions. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that when two numbers add up to a certain value, say S, and their product is P, they can be found using the quadratic formula. The numbers are the roots of the equation x² - Sx + P = 0. In this case, S is 19 and P is 70. So the equation would be x² - 19x + 70 = 0.

Wait, but maybe there's a simpler way without solving the quadratic. I can just check each option to see which pair adds up to 19 and multiplies to 70. Let's go through the options one by one.

Option A: 5 and 14. Adding them, 5 + 14 = 19. Good. Now the product: 5 * 14 = 70. Perfect, that's exactly what we need. So this looks like a possible answer.

But wait, I should check the other options to make sure there aren't multiple correct answers or if I made a mistake.

Option B: 4 and 15. 4 + 15 = 19. Product is 4 * 15 = 60. Not 70, so no.

Option C: 1 and 18. Sum is 19, product is 18. Not 70.

Option D: 9 and 10. Sum is 19, product is 90. Nope.

Option E: 12 and 7. Sum is 19, product is 84. Not 70.

Option F: 2 and 17. Sum is 19, product is 34. No.

Option G: 3 and 16. Sum is 19, product is 48. Not right.

Option H: 7 and 10. Wait, 7 + 10 is 17, not 19. Oh, wait no, 7 + 10 is 17. Wait, no, 7 + 10 is actually 17. So that's incorrect. Wait, did I make a mistake here? Let me check again. 7 +10 is 17, so it doesn't add up to 19. So H is out.

Option I: 8 and 11. 8 +11=19. Product is 88. Not 70.

Option J: 6 and 13. 6+13=19. Product is 78. Not 70.

So the only option that fits both conditions is A: 5 and 14.

The correct answer is A: 5 and 14, as they add up to 19 and multiply to 70.
