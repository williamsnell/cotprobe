Okay, so I've got this problem about calculating the absolute entropy of cadmium at 298 K. Hmm, I remember from my thermodynamics class that entropy can be calculated using integrals involving heat capacity. The question mentions using the T^3 law below 12°C, but wait, the temperature given is 298 K, which is about 25°C, so it's above 12°C. Hmm, that might complicate things because the T^3 law might not be valid there. But the problem says to assume it's valid below 12°C, so maybe I need to adjust the approach.

Wait, no, the data provided goes up to 298 K, so perhaps I should use the data points around that temperature. Let me look at the data table again. It lists Cp values at various temperatures for cadmium. The last entry is at T=298.16 K with Cp=6.224 cal/(deg·g-atom). But the question is about entropy at 298 K, so I probably need to use Cp data from lower temperatures and integrate up to 298 K, but considering the T^3 law only applies below 12°C (which is 285 K). So, maybe I should calculate the entropy change from 0 K up to 285 K using the T^3 law and then from 285 K to 298 K using the provided Cp data.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. The problem says to assume the T^3 law is valid below 12°C, which is 285 K, and Cp = Cv at these low temps. So, from 0 to 285 K, I can use the T^3 law. Then, from 285 K to 298 K, I have to use the Cp data provided.

I think the formula for entropy using Cp is S = integral from T_initial to T_final of Cp / T dT. So, the absolute entropy would be the sum of two parts: from 0 to 285 K using the T^3 law and from 285 K to 298 K using the given Cp data.

First, for the T^3 law. The molar heat capacity at constant volume, Cv, is proportional to T^3. Wait, but the problem says Cp and Cv are the same, so Cp = Cv. So, Cp = γ T^3, where γ is a constant. For the T^3 law, the entropy change from 0 to T is given by S = (3/2) γ T^2. Hmm, because the integral of (γ T^3)/T dT from 0 to T is (γ T^4)/4, but wait, maybe I'm mixing up the constants. Let me think again.

Wait, the general formula for entropy using Cp is S = ∫ (Cp / T) dT. For the T^3 law, Cp = γ T^3. So, S = ∫ (γ T^3 / T) dT = ∫ γ T^2 dT from 0 to T. The integral of T^2 is T^3/3, so S = γ (T^3)/3. But wait, I think the correct formula when Cp = a T^3 is S = (3/2) a (T^2 - T0^2), where T0 is the reference temperature, usually 0 K. But since we're calculating absolute entropy, maybe the reference is at 0 K, so the integral becomes from 0 to T. But I'm not entirely sure if it's (3/2) a T^2 or something else. Maybe I should look up the formula again. Oh right, for Cp = a T^3, the entropy change from 0 to T is S = (3/2) a T^2.

Wait, let me double-check. The entropy change is ∫ (Cp / T) dT from 0 to T. If Cp = a T^3, then it's ∫ a T^3 / T dT = ∫ a T^2 dT = a T^3 /3. Hmm, but I've read before that for the Debye model, the entropy is (3/2) (γ) T^2, where γ is the Debye constant. So maybe the formula is S = (3/2) γ T^2.

Wait, I think I might be mixing up the Debye model, which uses a different approach. Let me clarify. The Debye model gives the heat capacity as Cp = γ T^3 for T << Debye temperature. The entropy is then S = (3γ/2) T^2. So, yes, S = (3γ/2) T^2. But here, the problem says to use the T^3 law, so I'll proceed with that.

But I don't have the value of γ for cadmium. Wait, perhaps I can calculate γ using the Cp data at a certain temperature. Since Cp = γ T^3, I can find γ by rearranging: γ = Cp / T^3. Looking at the data, the first data point is at 12°C, which is 285 K, with Cp=5.413 cal/(deg·g-atom). Wait, wait, no, the data is in two columns: the first column is T in °C, the second in T_K. Wait, let me look again.

Looking at the data, the first line after the headers is:

12 0.392 → I think this is T=12°C (which is 285 K) and Cp=0.392 cal/(deg·g-atom).

Wait, no, wait, the data structure is a bit confusing. Let me parse it correctly. The first two numbers after the headers are probably the first data point. So, the first line after headers is:

12 0.392 130 5.608 → Hmm, maybe that's two data points. Let me check. It seems that each line has two sets of T and Cp values. So, the first line after headers is T=12°C, Cp=0.392; T=130, Cp=5.608. Wait, that can't be right because the temperatures are in °C and K? Wait, no, the first column is T in °C, the second column is Cp at that T, then the third is T in K, and the fourth is Cp at that K? Hmm, perhaps each line has two data points. Let me look again.

Wait, the first line is:

12 0.392 130 5.608

So, perhaps that's two data points: T=12°C (285 K) with Cp=0.392, and T=130 K with Cp=5.608. Hmm, but 12°C is 285 K, so maybe the data is in pairs: first two numbers are T in °C and Cp, then next two are T in K and Cp? That seems inconsistent. Alternatively, perhaps it's T in °C and Cp, then another T in °C and Cp? No, the third number is 130, which would be a high temperature in K, maybe 130 K is about -143°C. So, perhaps each line has two data points: one in °C and one in K. That makes more sense.

So, the first line is T=12°C (285 K), Cp=0.392; T=130 K, Cp=5.608. So, for T=130 K, Cp=5.608 cal/(deg·g-atom). Similarly, the next line is T=14°C (287 K), Cp=0.592; T=140 K, Cp=5.684. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because 14°C is 287 K, but the next K is 140, which is about -133°C.

Wait, but the problem says to use the T^3 law below 12°C (285 K), so perhaps I should use the data at T=12°C (285 K) as the upper limit for the T^3 law. So, for T from 0 K to 285 K, I can use the T^3 law, and for T from 285 K to 298 K, I can use the Cp data provided.

So, first, I need to calculate the entropy from 0 K to 285 K using the T^3 law. But to do that, I need the value of γ at T=285 K. Wait, but γ is a constant for the material at low temperatures. So, using Cp at T=285 K, which is 285 K (12°C) with Cp=5.413 cal/(deg·g-atom). Wait, no, looking back, at 12°C (285 K), the Cp is 5.413? Wait, no, let me look at the data again.

Wait, the data starts with:

12 0.392 130 5.608 → So, first data point: T=12°C (285 K), Cp=0.392 cal/(deg·g-atom). Then T=130 K, Cp=5.608.

Wait, that seems too low for Cp at 130 K. Or perhaps I have the columns mixed up. Maybe the first two numbers are T in °C and Cp, the next two are T in K and Cp. So, at T=12°C (285 K), Cp=0.392. At T=130 K, Cp=5.608. So, perhaps the data alternates between °C and K.

But this is getting confusing. Alternatively, maybe each line has a T in °C and Cp, then another T in °C and Cp. But 130°C would be high, but the data includes up to 290°C and 298 K. Hmm, perhaps I should look for the Cp at T=285 K, which is 12°C. So, using that T and Cp, I can find γ.

So, Cp = γ T^3 → γ = Cp / T^3. At T=285 K, Cp=0.392 cal/(deg·g-atom). So, γ = 0.392 / (285)^3. Let me compute that.

Wait, 285^3 is 285 * 285 = 81225; 81225 * 285 ≈ let me compute 81225 * 200 =16,245,000; 81225*85=6,899,125. So total ≈23,144,125. So, γ ≈ 0.392 / 23,144,125 ≈ 1.693e-8 cal/(K^3·g-atom).

Wait, that seems really small. Maybe I'm making a mistake here. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the Cp value at a higher temperature, but within the T^3 law region. Wait, the problem says the T^3 law is valid below 12°C, so up to 285 K. So, perhaps using the Cp at 285 K is correct.

Now, the entropy from 0 to 285 K using the T^3 law is S1 = (3/2) γ T^2. Plugging in γ and T=285 K.

Wait, but wait, the integral of Cp/T dT from 0 to T when Cp=γ T^3 is ∫ (γ T^3)/T dT = ∫ γ T^2 dT = γ T^3 /3. So S1 = γ (285)^3 /3. Hmm, yes, that's correct.

So, S1 = (0.392 cal/(deg·g-atom)) / (285)^3 * (285)^3 /3 → Wait, no, because γ = Cp / T^3, so S1 = ∫ (γ T^3 / T) dT from 0 to T = ∫ γ T^2 dT = γ T^3 /3. So, S1 = (0.392) * (285)^3 / (285)^3 * (285)^3 /3 → Wait, no, let me compute it correctly.

Wait, γ = Cp / T^3 = 0.392 / (285)^3. So, S1 = γ * (285)^3 /3 = (0.392 / (285)^3) * (285)^3 /3 = 0.392 /3 ≈ 0.1307 cal/(deg·g-atom).

Wait, that seems too low. Maybe I'm making a mistake in the approach. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is S = (3/2) γ T^2.

Wait, using S = (3/2) γ T^2, with γ = Cp / T^3 at T=285 K:

γ = 0.392 / (285)^3 ≈ 0.392 / 23,144,125 ≈ 1.693e-8 cal/(K^3·g-atom).

Then S1 = (3/2) * 1.693e-8 * (285)^2.

Calculating (285)^2 = 81,225.

So, S1 = 1.5 * 1.693e-8 * 81,225 ≈ 1.5 * 1.693e-8 * 8.1225e4.

Compute 1.693e-8 * 8.1225e4 = (1.693 * 8.1225) * 1e-4 ≈ (13.75) * 1e-4 ≈ 0.001375.

Then multiply by 1.5: 1.5 * 0.001375 ≈ 0.0020625 cal/(deg·g-atom). Hmm, that's about 0.002 cal/(deg·g-atom), which seems way too low. I must be doing something wrong.

Wait, maybe I'm using the wrong formula. Alternatively, perhaps the entropy at 285 K can be found using the Cp at that temperature, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the Cp data from 285 K to 298 K and integrate that part, assuming that the T^3 law isn't needed beyond 285 K.

Wait, the problem says to assume the T^3 law is valid below 12°C, which is 285 K. So, for T >285 K, I should use the Cp data provided. So, perhaps the approach is:

1. Calculate the entropy from 0 K to 285 K using the T^3 law, using the Cp at 285 K to find γ.

2. Calculate the entropy from 285 K to 298 K using the Cp data at higher temperatures.

3. Sum both parts to get the total entropy at 298 K.

But I'm getting stuck on the first part because the entropy from 0 to 285 K seems too low. Maybe I should proceed differently.

Alternatively, perhaps the T^3 law is not required beyond a certain point, and the problem is asking to use the data given, perhaps using the Cp at 298 K directly. Wait, the last data point is at 298.16 K with Cp=6.224 cal/(deg·g-atom). But the problem is asking for absolute entropy, which requires integrating from 0 to 298 K. But without data below 12°C, perhaps I should use the T^3 law up to 12°C and then use the Cp data from 12°C to 298 K.

Wait, perhaps the approach is to calculate the entropy change from 0 to 285 K using the T^3 law, and then from 285 K to 298 K using the Cp data.

But I'm getting stuck on how to compute the first part. Alternatively, perhaps I can find the entropy at 285 K using the Cp data and then compute the entropy from 285 K to 298 K.

Wait, but the problem says to use the T^3 law below 12°C, so perhaps the entropy from 0 to 285 K is negligible or considered as a constant, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the Cp data from 0 to 285 K and then from 285 K to 298 K. But I don't have Cp data below 12°C, except the first data point at 12°C (285 K) with Cp=0.392.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to use the T^3 law for the entire range up to 298 K, but that can't be right because the T^3 law is only valid below 12°C.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simplifying and just wants me to use the Cp at 298 K to compute the entropy change from 0 to 298 K, but that would ignore the temperature dependence of Cp.

Wait, maybe I should think of the problem differently. The question says to assume the T^3 law is valid below 12°C and that Cp = Cv at these low temperatures. So, perhaps I can calculate the entropy from 0 to 285 K using the T^3 law and the Cp at 285 K, and then from 285 K to 298 K using the Cp data provided.

So, let's proceed step by step.

First, calculate the entropy from 0 K to 285 K using the T^3 law.

Cp(T) = γ T^3, so γ = Cp(285 K) / (285)^3.

Cp at 285 K is 0.392 cal/(deg·g-atom).

So, γ = 0.392 / (285)^3.

But wait, 285^3 is 285 * 285 = 81225; 81225 * 285 ≈ 23,144,125.

So, γ ≈ 0.392 / 23,144,125 ≈ 1.693e-8 cal/(K^3·g-atom).

Now, the entropy from 0 to 285 K is S1 = ∫ (γ T^3)/T dT from 0 to 285 = ∫ γ T^2 dT = γ * (285^3)/3.

So, S1 = (0.392) * (285^3) / (3 * (285)^3) )? Wait, no, because γ = Cp / T^3, so S1 = (Cp / T^3) * (T^3)/3 = Cp /3.

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, S1 = ∫ (Cp / T) dT from 0 to T.

If Cp = γ T^3, then S1 = ∫ (γ T^3)/T dT = ∫ γ T^2 dT from 0 to T.

Which is γ * (T^3)/3.

But since γ = Cp / T^3, substituting:

S1 = (Cp / T^3) * (T^3)/3 = Cp /3.

Wait, that's a much simpler way. So, S1 = Cp(285 K) /3 = 0.392 /3 ≈ 0.1307 cal/(deg·g-atom).

That seems low, but maybe it's correct.

Now, the second part is from 285 K to 298 K. I need to calculate the entropy change using the Cp data. But I need to choose the appropriate Cp values. The data at 298 K is Cp=6.224 cal/(deg·g-atom). But I need Cp at 285 K and 298 K.

Wait, but the data for 285 K is at 12°C, which is the last data point before the higher temperatures. So, perhaps I can use linear interpolation between the Cp values at 285 K and 298 K.

Wait, looking at the data, the last line is:

290 6.201 298.16 6.224

Wait, that's T=290°C (which is way high), Cp=6.201, and T=298.16 K, Cp=6.224.

Wait, but 290°C is 563 K, which is way above 298 K. So, perhaps I should use the data at 298.16 K and interpolate between that and the nearest lower temperature. The data before that is at 290 K (which is 290 K, not 290°C). Wait, I'm getting confused again.

Wait, the data is structured as:

Each line has two sets of T and Cp. For example, the first line after headers is:

12 0.392 130 5.608 → T=12°C, Cp=0.392; T=130 K, Cp=5.608.

But wait, 12°C is 285 K, so perhaps the data is a bit mixed up. Alternatively, perhaps the data is presented with T in °C and K, but I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps it's better to list all the data points properly.

Looking at the data, it's in the format:

°C, Cp, K, Cp.

So, the first line is:

12°C → 285 K, Cp=0.392; 130 K, Cp=5.608.

Second line: 14°C → 287 K, Cp=0.592; 140 K, Cp=5.684.

Third line: 16°C → 289 K, Cp=0.804; 150 K, Cp=5.746.

Wait, but 16°C is 289 K, which is just a bit higher than 285 K. So, the data at 285 K is at 12°C, and the next data points are at 14°C (287 K), 16°C (289 K), etc.

Wait, but I'm looking for Cp at 285 K, which is 12°C, and at higher temperatures like 298 K. The data at 290 K is 290 K, Cp=6.201, and 298.16 K, Cp=6.224.

So, from 285 K to 298 K, I can use the Cp data at 285 K (0.392), 290 K (6.201), and 298.16 K (6.224).

Wait, but the Cp increases with temperature, so perhaps I can approximate the Cp as roughly constant between 285 K and 298 K.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the Cp at 285 K and 298 K and approximate the entropy change using the average Cp.

But that might not be accurate. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the Cp data at 298 K to compute the entropy change from 285 K to 298 K.

Wait, but I don't have the Cp at 285 K for higher temperatures. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the Cp at 298 K, which is 6.224, and assume it's roughly constant between 285 K and 298 K. Then, the entropy change S2 = ∫ (Cp / T) dT from 285 K to 298 K with Cp=6.224.

So, S2 = 6.224 * ln(298/285).

Compute ln(298/285) ≈ ln(1.0452) ≈ 0.0444.

So, S2 ≈ 6.224 * 0.0444 ≈ 0.2767 cal/(deg·g-atom).

Then, the total entropy S_total = S1 + S2 = 0.1307 + 0.2767 ≈ 0.4074 cal/(deg·g-atom).

But looking at the options, the answers are around 8 to 22 cal/(deg·g-atom), which is much higher than 0.4. So, I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait a minute, perhaps I'm using the wrong units or misapplying the formulas. Let me check again.

Wait, the units for Cp are cal/(deg·g-atom). So, when I integrate Cp/T dT, the units would be cal/(deg·g-atom) * (1/K) * K → cal/(g-atom)·ln(K). Wait, but I'm getting confused with the units.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the entropy in cal/(g-atom)·ln(K) and then convert it to cal/(g-atom)·K by multiplying by ln(e) or something else, but I'm not sure.

Wait, no, the integral ∫(Cp/T) dT from T1 to T2 is in units of (cal/(g-atom·K)) * ln(K), which doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps I'm missing a factor. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that Cp is in cal/(g-atom·K), so when I integrate Cp/T dT, the units are (cal/(g-atom·K)) * (1/K) * K → cal/(g-atom).

Wait, no, because T is in K, so Cp is cal/(g-atom·K), and when you divide by T (K), you get cal/(g-atom·K^2). Integrating with respect to T (K) would give cal/(g-atom·K). Hmm, that doesn't make sense for entropy, which should be in cal/(g-atom·K).

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the units. Let me think again. The entropy S has units of cal/(g-atom·K). The integral of Cp/T dT from T1 to T2 would have units of (cal/(g-atom·K)) * (1/K) * K → cal/(g-atom·K). Wait, no, because Cp is in cal/(g-atom·K), and T is in K, so Cp/T is (cal/(g-atom·K)) * (1/K) → cal/(g-atom·K^2). Integrating over T (K) would give cal/(g-atom·K). So, that's correct.

But in my earlier calculation, when I used Cp=0.392 at 285 K, I got S1=0.1307 cal/(g-atom·K), and S2≈0.2767 cal/(g-atom·K), summing to about 0.4074, which is way too low compared to the options given.

This suggests that perhaps the approach is incorrect. Alternatively, maybe the T^3 law isn't being applied correctly, or perhaps I should be using a different method.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to calculate the entropy change from 0 to 298 K using the Cp data provided, without splitting it into two parts. But how?

Wait, the problem says to assume the T^3 law is valid below 12°C, but the data provided includes temperatures up to 298 K. So, perhaps the intended approach is to use the Cp at 298 K and assume it's constant for the entire range, but that's not correct because Cp varies with temperature.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the Cp at 298 K to compute the entropy at 298 K, but that would ignore the temperature dependence.

Wait, perhaps I should use the data at 298 K directly. The Cp at 298 K is 6.224 cal/(g-atom·K). So, the entropy at 298 K would be S = ∫ (Cp / T) dT from 0 to 298 K. But without knowing Cp at all temperatures, I can't compute the integral directly. Unless I'm supposed to assume Cp is constant, which isn't the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to use the data at 298 K and assume that the entropy is approximately Cp ln(T) or something similar, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should look for a more straightforward approach. The problem gives data for Cp at various temperatures, including 298 K. The options are all around 8-22 cal/(g-atom·K), so perhaps the correct approach is to use Cp at 298 K and compute the entropy change from 0 to 298 K, assuming Cp is constant. But that's not accurate, but maybe it's what the problem expects.

So, S = Cp (298 K) * ln(298 K / 0 K). Wait, but ln(0) is undefined, so that's not possible. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects using Cp at 298 K and a reference entropy at a lower temperature, but without absolute entropy data, it's impossible to calculate absolute entropy.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Perhaps the problem expects me to use the formula S = ∫ (Cp / T) dT from 0 to T, and use the data to approximate the integral. But without knowing Cp at all temperatures, I can't do that exactly.

Wait, perhaps the problem is expecting me to use the data points provided and apply the formula for entropy change between consecutive data points, then sum them up. Let me try that.

Looking at the data, the last data point is at 298.16 K with Cp=6.224. The previous data point is at 290 K with Cp=6.201. So, the entropy change from 290 K to 298.16 K would be ∫ (Cp / T) dT ≈ average Cp * ln(T2/T1).

Assuming Cp is roughly constant between 290 K and 298 K, average Cp ≈ (6.201 +6.224)/2 ≈6.2125.

So, S2 = 6.2125 * ln(298.16/290) ≈6.2125 * ln(1.02746) ≈6.2125 * 0.02714 ≈0.1686 cal/(g-atom).

But that's just from 290 K to 298 K. I still need to account for the entropy from 0 K to 290 K, which isn't provided. So, perhaps the problem expects me to use the data from 285 K to 298 K, assuming that below 285 K, the T^3 law holds, and I can calculate S1 from 0 to 285 K using the T^3 law, then S2 from 285 K to 298 K using the Cp data.

But earlier, when I tried that, I got a very low entropy value. So, perhaps I made a mistake in applying the T^3 law.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula S = (3/2) γ T^2, where γ is Cp/(T^3).

At T=285 K, Cp=0.392.

So, γ = 0.392 / (285)^3 ≈ 0.392 / 23,144,125 ≈1.693e-8 cal/(K^3·g-atom).

Then S1 = (3/2) * 1.693e-8 * (285)^2.

Compute (285)^2 = 81,225.

So, S1 = 1.5 * 1.693e-8 * 81,225 ≈1.5 * (1.693e-8 *8.1225e4).

Compute 1.693e-8 *8.1225e4 = (1.693 *8.1225) *1e-4 ≈13.75 *1e-4≈0.001375.

Multiply by 1.5: 0.0020625 cal/(g-atom).

Then, from 285 K to 298 K, using Cp=6.224 as average:

S2 = 6.224 * ln(298/285) ≈6.224 *0.0444≈0.2767 cal/(g-atom).

Total S = 0.0020625 + 0.2767 ≈0.2788 cal/(g-atom).

But this is still way below the options given. So, I must be missing something.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different approach, such as using the formula S = C ln T + constant, but without knowing the constant, it's impossible.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the data at 298 K and assume that the entropy is just Cp at 298 K multiplied by some factor. Looking at the options, they are all around 10-22, which is much higher than my calculated 0.28.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the units. Let me check the data again. The Cp values are given in cal/(deg·g-atom), which is cal/(°C·g-atom). Wait, that's unusual because Cp is usually in cal/(g·K). Did I misinterpret the units?

Oh wait, perhaps the units are cal/(g·K), and the °C is just the temperature scale, not part of the unit. That would make more sense. So, Cp is in cal/(g·K), and the temperature is in °C or K.

If that's the case, then the units would make sense, and the earlier calculations would be correct, but the values would still be too low.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the units are cal/(mol·K), but the problem states "g-atom", so it's per gram-atom, which is per mole, since one g-atom is one mole.

Wait, perhaps I should convert grams to moles, but the problem states "g-atom", so it's per gram-atomic mass, which is per mole.

But regardless, the calculated entropy is still too low.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to sum the Cp at different temperatures and multiply by the temperature difference, but that's not the correct approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula S = ∫ Cp ln T dT from 0 to T. But I'm not sure.

Wait, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for another approach. The options are:

A:12.186

B:8.186

C:20.186

D:11.086

E:16.186

F:14.186

G:15.086

H:22.186

I:10.186

J:18.186

All are around 8-22. So, perhaps the correct approach is to use the Cp at 298 K and compute the entropy change from 0 to 298 K assuming Cp is constant, but that would give S= Cp * ln(298/0), which is undefined because ln(0) is negative infinity. So that's not possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different formula, such as S = (3/2) R ln T + ... but without knowing R in these units, I can't proceed.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to use the data at 298 K and assume that the entropy is approximately Cp at 298 K multiplied by a factor. But without more data, I can't compute that.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the Cp at 298 K, which is 6.224, but that's not one of the options. The options are all around 8-22, so that's not it.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the molar gas constant R. R is 8.314 J/(mol·K), but in cal, R is 1.987 cal/(mol·K). But I'm not sure how that would apply here.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to use the formula S = nR ln T + ... but without knowing n, it's impossible.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is using the molar entropy and the data is in cal/(mol·K), but the question states "g-atom", which is per mole.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the entropy at 298 K using the Cp data and integrate from 0 to 298 K, but without the full Cp data, I can't do that. So, perhaps the intended approach is to use the Cp at 298 K and assume it's constant, but that would give an entropy much higher than the options suggest.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to use the data at 298 K and the data at 285 K to calculate the entropy change between those two points and assume that's the total entropy, but that would ignore the entropy below 285 K.

I'm really stuck here. Maybe I should look for another approach. Wait, perhaps the problem is expecting me to use the formula S = ∫ (Cp / T) dT from 0 to T, and since the T^3 law is valid below 12°C, and the Cp data is provided above that, I can calculate the entropy in two parts.

Wait, perhaps I should use the Cp at 285 K to find γ and calculate the entropy from 0 to 285 K, then use the Cp data from 285 K to 298 K.

So, S1 = (3/2) γ T^2, with γ = Cp / T^3 at 285 K.

γ = 0.392 / (285)^3 ≈1.693e-8 cal/(K^3·g-atom).

S1 = (3/2)*1.693e-8*(285)^2 ≈ 0.0020625 cal/(g-atom).

Then, from 285 K to 298 K, using Cp=6.224 cal/(g-atom·K):

S2 = ∫ (6.224 / T) dT from 285 to 298 = 6.224 * ln(298/285) ≈6.224 *0.0444≈0.2767 cal/(g-atom).

Total S ≈0.0020625 +0.2767≈0.2788 cal/(g-atom).

But the options are much higher, so perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use Cp in a different way.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to calculate the change in entropy from 0 to 298 K using the Cp data provided, assuming that the T^3 law applies only below 12°C, and uses the given Cp data for the rest. But without the full Cp data, I can't compute the integral accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to use the data at 298 K and assume that the entropy is proportional to Cp. But that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the answer that matches the Cp at 298 K multiplied by a factor. The Cp is 6.224. None of the options are close to that, but option J is 18.186, which is about 3 times higher.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the formula S = C ln T, where C is a constant. If S = C ln T, then at T=298 K, S= C ln(298). If I assume C is around 8 cal/(g-atom), then S would be around 8 * 6 ≈48, which is way higher than the options.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the problem expects me to use the data at 298 K and assume that the entropy is simply the Cp at that temperature multiplied by a factor. But without more information, I can't proceed.

Given that I'm stuck, perhaps I should make an educated guess. The options are around 8-22, and the Cp at 298 K is 6.224. Maybe the correct answer is around 16 cal/(g-atom), which would be option E:16.186.

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B:8.186, which is close to the Cp at 298 K multiplied by ln(298/ something). But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is using the formula S = ∫ Cp d ln T from 0 to T. So, for each data point, calculate Cp * ln(T_next / T_prev), and sum them up.

But I need data points from 0 to 298 K. Since I don't have data below 285 K, perhaps I can only calculate from 285 K to 298 K.

So, from 285 K to 298 K, using Cp=6.224 at 298 K. The previous data point is at 290 K, Cp=6.201.

So, the entropy change from 290 K to 298 K is 6.21 (average) * ln(298/290) ≈6.21 *0.027 ≈0.1678.

But that's just a small part. Without data below 285 K, I can't compute the rest.

Given that I'm stuck, I'll have to make a guess. The options are A to J, with E being 16.186. Considering that the Cp at 298 K is 6.224, and the entropy is higher, perhaps the answer is around 16, so I'll go with option E:16.186.

To determine the absolute entropy of cadmium at 298 K, the problem involves using the provided heat capacity (Cp) data and assuming the T³ law is valid below 12°C (285 K). The approach involves calculating the entropy in two parts: from 0 K to 285 K using the T³ law and from 285 K to 298 K using the Cp data.

1. **Entropy from 0 K to 285 K (T³ law):**  
   Using Cp at 285 K (0.392 cal/(deg·g-atom)), the constant γ is calculated as:  
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{\text{Cp}}{T^3} = \frac{0.392}{(285)^3} \approx 1.693 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{cal/(K³·g-atom)}
   \]  
   The entropy change is then:  
   \[
   S_1 = \frac{3}{2} \gamma T^2 = \frac{3}{2} \times 1.693 \times 10^{-8} \times (285)^2 \approx 0.00206 \, \text{cal/(g-atom)}
   \]

2. **Entropy from 285 K to 298 K (Cp data):**  
   Using Cp at 298 K (6.224 cal/(deg·g-atom)), the entropy change is approximated as:  
   \[
   S_2 = \int \frac{\text{Cp}}{T} dT \approx \text{Cp} \cdot \ln\left(\frac{T_2}{T_1}\right) = 6.224 \cdot \ln\left(\frac{298}{285}\right) \approx 0.2767 \, \text{cal/(g-atom)}
   \]

3. **Total Entropy at 298 K:**  
   Summing the two parts:  
   \[
   S_{\text{total}} = S_1 + S_2 \approx 0.00206 + 0.2767 \approx 0.2788 \, \text{cal/(g-atom)}
   \]  
   However, this value is significantly lower than the provided options (8–22 cal/(g-atom)). This discrepancy suggests either an error in the approach or a misinterpretation of the problem's assumptions.

Given the options and the reasoning, the most plausible answer is **E: 16.186 cal/(g-atom)**, as it aligns with the expected range of absolute entropy values for metals like cadmium at 298 K.

Answer: E
