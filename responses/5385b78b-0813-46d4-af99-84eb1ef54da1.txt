Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about why Pizarro was able to subdue the entire Inca Empire. I'm a bit rusty on my history, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

First, I remember that Francisco Pizarro was a Spanish conquistador who led the conquest of the Inca Empire. The question is asking about the main reason he was able to do this. The options are A through J, so I need to evaluate each one.

Option A says the Incas were suffering from a plague when Pizarro arrived. I think I've heard something about diseases affecting Native American populations after European contact, but I'm not sure if it was already happening when Pizarro arrived. Maybe it was more of a later issue, like during the time of Cortes in Mexico. So I'm not sure about A.

Option B claims the empire had never won the allegiance of the peoples it had conquered. That doesn't sound right. The Inca Empire was known for its efficient administrative system and integrating conquered peoples into their empire, often through a system of reciprocity and by building infrastructure. So B seems unlikely.

Option C suggests the Incas were weakened by a civil war. I remember something about the Inca Empire being in turmoil when Pizarro arrived. There was a civil war between two brothers, Huascar and Atahualpa. This internal conflict probably made it harder for the Incas to unite and resist the Spanish. So C sounds plausible.

Option D says the Incas willingly surrendered because they expected Pizarro. That doesn't make sense. Why would they surrender without a fight? The Incas were a powerful empire, so they would likely fight unless they had no choice. So D is probably incorrect.

Option E mentions Pizarro arriving with a superior force of over 80,000 soldiers. Wait, I thought the Spanish forces were much smaller. Pizarro had a few hundred soldiers, maybe around 160-200, plus some native allies. 80,000 seems way too high, so E is likely wrong.

Option F states Pizarro used advanced technology the Incas couldn't comprehend. While the Spanish did have guns and horses, which were new to the Incas, I don't think that's the main reason. The Incas had their own advanced systems, and the numbers weren't overwhelmingly large. Plus, the civil war probably played a bigger role. So F might not be the best answer.

Option G says his horses and guns frightened the Incas. Maybe to some extent, but again, the main issue was probably the internal conflict. The Spanish's advantages were real, but without the Incas being weak, they might not have been enough. So G is possible but perhaps not the main reason.

Option H suggests Pizarro had support from other native tribes who were enemies of the Incas. That makes sense. The Spanish often allied with local groups who were discontented with Inca rule. For example, the Chancas or other groups might have joined Pizarro, helping him against the Incas. So H is a strong contender.

Option I says he was a brilliant military strategist. While Pizarro was certainly effective, I'm not sure if his strategic abilities alone were the main reason. Many factors contributed, so I might not pick I as the top reason.

Option J claims Pizarro manipulated the Incas into believing he was a god. I think the Inca emperor was considered divine, but Pizarro might have exploited this by presenting himself as a deity or an ally of the gods. For example, he might have used the arrival of the Spanish as a fulfillment of Inca prophecies. This manipulation could have undermined Inca resistance. So J is also a possible answer.

Now, considering all options, the key factors were likely the internal strife (Option C) and the alliances with other tribes (Option H). Some sources say that the civil war between Huascar and Atahualpa was a major factor because it divided the Inca forces. Additionally, Pizarro's alliances with neighboring tribes who were enemies of the Incas would have provided numerical support and inside help.

So, between C and H, which is more accurate? I think both played roles, but the question asks for the main reason. The civil war (C) probably weakened the Inca Empire significantly, making it easier for Pizarro to take over. However, without the support of other tribes (H), Pizarro might not have been as effective. But I'm not sure which was more decisive.

Wait, another angle: Pizarro's forces were small, so relying on local allies was crucial. If the Incas were already weakened by a civil war, their ability to resist was compromised. So both C and H are important, but the question is about the primary reason.

I think the main reason was the civil war (C) because without internal division, the Incas would have been a stronger opponent. The support from other tribes (H) was a secondary factor that helped, but the primary reason was the Inca's own weakness due to war.

Alternatively, some sources mention that Pizarro cleverly manipulated the situation, making the Incas see him as a savior or a god (J). But I'm not sure how much that contributed compared to the civil war.

I'm a bit torn between C and H, but I think the civil war (C) was the most significant factor. So I'll go with C.

The primary reason Pizarro was able to subdue the Inca Empire was due to the internal conflict, or civil war, between the Inca brothers Huascar and Atahualpa. This weakened the empire's ability to resist the Spanish forces. While alliances with other tribes and Pizarro's strategic advantages also played roles, the civil war was the decisive factor.

Answer: C
