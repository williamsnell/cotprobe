Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking. 

The question says that during a chemical reaction, NO(g) is reduced, and no nitrogen-containing compound is oxidized. Then, it asks which of the given options is a possible product. The options are from A to F, with various nitrogen compounds listed.

First, I need to recall what it means for a substance to be reduced. Reduction in chemical terms means gaining electrons, which lowers the oxidation state of the element. So, if NO is being reduced, its nitrogen's oxidation state must go down.

Let's look at the oxidation states in NO. Oxygen usually has an oxidation state of -2. The molecule NO is a neutral molecule, so the sum of oxidation states is zero. Let me calculate the oxidation state of nitrogen in NO. Let x be the oxidation state of N. Then x + (-2) = 0 → x = +2. So nitrogen in NO is +2.

Now, since NO is being reduced, the product must have nitrogen with a lower oxidation state. So possible oxidation states could be +1, 0, or even negative. Let's check each option to see if their nitrogen oxidation states are lower than +2.

Option A: N2(g). This is elemental nitrogen. In N2, each N atom has an oxidation state of 0. That's lower than +2, so this is a possible product.

Option B: N2O5(g). Let's calculate the oxidation state of N here. Let x be N's oxidation state. Each O is -2, so 2x + 5*(-2) = 0 → 2x -10 =0 → x=+5. That's higher than +2, which means N is oxidized, not reduced. Since the question states that no nitrogen-containing compound is oxidized, this can't be the product.

Option C: NO(g). That's the same as the reactant. So if NO is reduced, it can't stay the same. Unless it's a catalyst, but in the reaction, if NO is a reactant and being reduced, then the product must be different. So this is unlikely. Also, if it's a product, then what's the point of the reaction? Unless it's a catalyst, but I don't think that's the case here.

Option D: NO2^-(aq). Let's find the oxidation state. The ion has a charge of -1. Each O is -2. So for N: x + 2*(-2) = -1 → x -4 = -1 → x=+3. That's higher than +2, so N is oxidized. But the question says no nitrogen compound is oxidized, so this can't be the product.

Option E: NO3^-(aq). Here, the ion has a charge of -1. Each O is -2. So x +3*(-2) = -1 → x -6 = -1 → x=+5. Again, higher than +2, so N is oxidized. Not possible.

Option F: NO2(g). Each O is -2. The molecule is neutral, so oxidation state of N: x +2*(-2)=0 → x=+4. That's higher than +2, so N is oxidized. Not allowed.

So, the only option where N's oxidation state is lower than +2 is option A, N2(g), where it's 0. Therefore, the product must be N2.

The reaction involves NO(g) being reduced, meaning the nitrogen's oxidation state decreases. In NO, nitrogen has an oxidation state of +2. The possible products must have nitrogen in a lower oxidation state. 

- **Option A (N₂(g))**: Nitrogen in N₂ has an oxidation state of 0, which is lower than +2, making it a valid product.
- **Options B, D, E, and F**: All involve nitrogen in oxidation states higher than +2, which would require oxidation, contradicting the problem statement.
- **Option C (NO(g))**: This is the same as the reactant, so it cannot be the product of a reduction reaction.

Thus, the only possible product is **N₂(g)**.

Answer: A
