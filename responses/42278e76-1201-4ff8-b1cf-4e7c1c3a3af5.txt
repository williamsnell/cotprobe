Alright, so I've got this multiple-choice question here about why institutionalists in the early twentieth century rejected laissez-faire. Hmm, okay, let me think through this.

First, I need to understand who institutionalists were. From what I remember, institutional economics is a school of thought that emphasizes the role of institutions (like laws, social norms, organizations) in shaping economic behavior. They were active around the early 1900s, right? So, this was a time when laissez-faire was a dominant economic policy in many countries, especially in the US.

Laissez-faire is the idea that the government shouldn't interfere in the economy, letting the free market operate on its own. But why would institutionalists reject that? I think it's because they observed certain problems with the free market approach. Let me go through the options one by one.

Option A says they thought government intervention would reduce economic freedom. Wait, that sounds like a pro-laissez-faire argument. If they were rejecting laissez-faire, they probably didn't believe in less government intervention, so A might not be the reason they rejected it.

Option B suggests they were convinced that laissez-faire ensures equitable wealth distribution. But I think laissez-faire often leads to unequal wealth distribution because the market doesn't inherently balance things out. So if institutionalists were rejecting it, they might have seen it as not leading to equity, making B incorrect.

Option C mentions widespread poverty and business cycle fluctuations. That makes sense. The early 20th century had the Great Depression, and before that, there were periodic economic crises. Institutionalists probably saw that laissez-faire wasn't handling these issues well, leading to poverty and economic instability. So C seems plausible.

Option D says they thought laissez-faire would lead to more efficient and ethical business practices. That doesn't sound right. If they rejected it, they likely didn't think it promoted efficiency or ethics without regulation. So D is probably not the answer.

Option E states they favored socialism. While institutionalists might have been critical of pure laissez-faire, they weren't necessarily socialist. They wanted a mixed approach with some regulations, so E might not be the best fit.

Option F is about believing in supply and demand. Well, even Keynesians and institutionalists don't reject the basics of supply and demand; they just think more factors are at play. So F doesn't explain why they'd reject laissez-faire entirely.

Option G says they were satisfied with the economy. No, that doesn't make sense. If they were rejecting a policy, it's likely because they weren't satisfied with the outcomes.

Option H suggests they thought laissez-faire would prevent economic crises. But history shows that crises like the Great Depression happened under laissez-faire, so institutionalists would have rejected that idea, making H incorrect.

Option I claims they felt laissez-faire would eliminate corruption and monopolies. In reality, without regulation, monopolies and corruption can thrive, so institutionalists probably didn't believe in this. Hence, I is not the answer.

Option J says they were for complete government control. That's more like a socialist or centrally planned economy. Institutionalists wanted a middle ground, not complete control, so J isn't right.

Putting it all together, the main reasons institutionalists rejected laissez-faire were likely due to the visible failures, like poverty and economic instability. So the correct answer should be C.

The institutionalists of the early twentieth century rejected laissez-faire because they observed the shortcomings of the free-market approach, particularly the widespread poverty and the fluctuations of the business cycle. These issues highlighted the need for government intervention and institutional structures to address economic instability and inequality.

Answer: C
