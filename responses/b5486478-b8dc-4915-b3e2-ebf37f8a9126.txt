Question:

Distinguish economic goods from free goods, and give an example of each.

Options:

A: Economic goods require large amounts of resources to produce, such as diamonds, while free goods are created with minimal resources, like sunlight.
B: Economic goods are non-renewable resources, like coal. Free goods regenerate naturally and have no cost, like wind energy.
C: Economic goods are plentiful and satisfy all wants, like air. Free goods are scarce and command a positive price, like oil.
D: Economic goods and free goods are the same, both are available in sufficient quantity to satisfy all wants.
E: Economic goods are produced by the government and are free of charge, like public education. Free goods are produced by private companies and have high prices, like smartphones.
F: Economic goods are those that cannot be consumed by multiple people at once, like a sandwich. Free goods can be shared by many simultaneously, like a public park.
G: Economic goods are free, like air. Free goods are costly and scarce, like oil.
H: Economic goods are scarce and command a positive price, like oil. Free goods are plentiful and satisfy all wants, like air.
I: Economic goods are services that come at a cost, like legal advice. Free goods are natural phenomena that are not owned, like moonlight.
J: Economic goods are items with no intrinsic value, like currency. Free goods are essential for survival and cannot be owned, like oxygen.

Okay, so I have this question to answer about distinguishing economic goods from free goods and provide examples for each. The options are labeled A through J. Hmm, I need to think carefully about what each term means and how they differ.

First, I remember that economic goods are things that have both utility and scarcity. That means they provide some value to people and are not available in unlimited supply, so they have a price associated with them. Examples I can think of are like oil, diamonds, or even services like legal advice. These things are scarce, so people have to pay for them.

On the other hand, free goods are things that are available in such abundance that they don't have a price. They're not scarce, so they don't command a positive price. Examples might be air, sunlight, or even something like public parks where you don't pay to use them. Wait, but sometimes public parks might have fees, so maybe that's not the best example.

Wait, let me make sure. Free goods are things that are so plentiful that they don't have a market value. So air is a classic example because you can't really put a price on it, and it's everywhere. Sunlight is another one because it's freely available (except in some cases where you might pay for solar panels, but the sunlight itself isn't something you buy).

Now looking at the options:

Option A: Economic goods require large resources, like diamonds. Free goods have minimal resources, like sunlight. Hmm, that's partially correct. Diamonds do require resources and are economic goods, but sunlight is a free good. But I'm not sure if the distinction is about resource requirements. Maybe that's not the key difference.

Option B: Economic goods are non-renewable, like coal. Free goods regenerate and have no cost, like wind. Wait, wind energy is renewable, but is it a free good? You can generate wind energy with turbines, which do have costs. So maybe this isn't the best option.

Option C: Economic goods are plentiful and satisfy wants, like air. Free goods are scarce and have a price, like oil. Wait, that's the opposite. Air is a free good because it's plentiful, and oil is an economic good because it's scarce and has a price. So option C seems to mix them up.

Option D: Both are the same, available in sufficient quantity. No, that's wrong because economic goods are scarce, while free goods are not.

Option E: Economic goods are produced by the government and free, like public education. Free goods are from private companies with high prices, like smartphones. That doesn't make sense. Public education might be a public good, but smartphones are definitely economic goods with a price.

Option F: Economic goods can't be consumed by multiple people at once, like a sandwich. Free goods can be shared, like a public park. Well, a sandwich is a private good and can't be shared, but a public park is a free good because it's available without cost. But I'm not sure if this is the main distinction. The key difference is about scarcity and pricing, not consumption.

Option G: Economic goods are free, like air. Free goods are costly, like oil. That's the opposite of what I know. Air is a free good, oil is an economic good.

Option H: Economic goods are scarce and have a positive price, like oil. Free goods are plentiful and satisfy all wants, like air. Yes, this matches my understanding. Economic goods are scarce and thus have a price, while free goods are abundant and don't require payment.

Option I: Economic goods are services with a cost, like legal advice. Free goods are natural and not owned, like moonlight. While legal advice is an economic good, moonlight is a free good. But this option seems to define free goods as natural phenomena, which is part of it, but maybe not the complete picture.

Option J: Economic goods have no intrinsic value, like currency. Free goods are essential and can't be owned, like oxygen. Wait, currency has exchange value, so it's an economic good. Oxygen is essential but can be provided as a service (like bottled oxygen) which would be an economic good. So this option might be mixing things up.

So, putting it all together, the correct distinction is that economic goods are scarce and have a price, while free goods are abundant and don't have a price. Looking at the options, option H says exactly that: economic goods are scarce, like oil, and free goods are plentiful, like air.

I think the answer is H.

The correct answer is H. Economic goods are scarce and command a positive price, such as oil, while free goods are plentiful and satisfy all wants, like air.
