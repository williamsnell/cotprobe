Okay, so I've got this problem about nitrogen gas in an industrial process, and I need to find the pressure at 500 K using the van der Waals equation. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step.

First, I remember that the van der Waals equation is used to correct the ideal gas law for real gases, accounting for the volume of the gas molecules and the intermolecular attractions. The equation is given by:

\[ \left( P + a \frac{n^2}{V^2} \right) (V - n b) = n R T \]

Where:
- P is pressure
- V is volume
- n is the number of moles
- R is the gas constant
- T is temperature
- a and b are constants specific to the gas (given for nitrogen here)

The problem states that the container's volume is constant at 1.000 m³. The gas enters at 300 K and 100 atm, and the mass is 92.4 kg. We need to find the pressure at 500 K.

Wait, but the initial conditions are at 300 K, and the working temperature is 500 K. So the volume remains the same, but the temperature changes, which will affect the pressure. Since it's a real gas, we can't just use Charles's law or Gay-Lussac's law directly; we need to use the van der Waals equation for each state, perhaps.

But wait, the problem says the gas is heated to 500 K at a constant volume. So the initial state is probably at 300 K, and after heating, it's at 500 K. But the problem might require using the van der Waals equation at 500 K to find the new pressure. Alternatively, maybe we can find the number of moles from the initial state and then plug into the van der Waals equation at 500 K.

Let me check the given data:
- Mass of nitrogen (N₂) is 92.4 kg. Nitrogen's molar mass is 28 g/mol (since each N atom is ~14 g/mol, so 2 *14=28). So 92.4 kg is 92400 grams. Dividing by 28 gives moles: 92400 /28 = 3300 mol. So n ≈ 3300 mol.

Wait, let me double-check that calculation. 92400 divided by 28: 28*3300 = 92400, yes. So n=3300 mol.

The volume V is 1.000 m³. Oh wait, the van der Waals equation uses volume in dm³, I think. Because 1 m³ is 1000 liters, which is 1000 dm³. So V = 1000 dm³.

But wait, the units for a and b are given as dm^6 atm mol^-2 and dm^3 mol^-1, respectively. So we need to make sure all units are compatible.

The van der Waals equation is usually written with V in dm³, P in atm, and T in Kelvin. So I'll proceed with those units.

Now, the initial state is at 300 K and 100 atm, but maybe the van der Waals equation isn't necessary there because the pressure is quite high, but perhaps the problem is just giving the initial conditions to find n, and then we can use that n to compute the pressure at 500 K.

Wait, but if the container is rigid (constant volume), then when the temperature changes, the pressure will change. But for an ideal gas, we'd use PV = nRT. But since it's a real gas, we can't do that; we have to use the van der Waals equation for the final state at 500 K.

So the plan is:
1. Find the number of moles, n, using the initial state data and the van der Waals equation, or perhaps the ideal gas law as an approximation since maybe at 100 atm, the gas is not too far from ideal. Alternatively, maybe the initial state uses the van der Waals equation to find n. Hmm, but maybe it's easier to use the ideal gas law to find n, and then plug that into the van der Waals equation for the final state.

Wait, but the initial state is at 300 K and 100 atm. Let's think: at high pressures, real gases deviate more from ideal behavior, so perhaps we should use the van der Waals equation to find n from the initial state. But that might complicate things because we'd have to solve for n in the van der Waals equation, which is a cubic equation. That could be tricky, but maybe we can approximate it as an ideal gas because 100 atm is high pressure, and perhaps for the initial state, the pressure is high enough that the van der Waals correction is significant. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to compute n using the ideal gas law, even though it's an approximation.

Let me try that approach first. Using the ideal gas law at the initial state:

PV = nRT

We can solve for n:

n = PV/(RT)

But wait, the initial pressure is 100 atm, V is 1000 dm³, T is 300 K. R is 0.0821 dm³·atm/(mol·K).

So n = (100 atm * 1000 dm³) / (0.0821 * 300 K)

Calculating denominator: 0.0821 * 300 ≈ 24.63

So n ≈ (100,000) / 24.63 ≈ 4059 mol. Wait, but earlier I calculated n as 3300 mol from the mass. There's a discrepancy here. So that suggests that the initial state can't be treated as an ideal gas, and the van der Waals equation is necessary.

Hmm, this is a problem. Because using the ideal gas law gives a different n than the mass calculation. So perhaps the initial state must be analyzed using the van der Waals equation to find the correct n.

Wait, but the mass is given as 92.4 kg, which is fixed. So the number of moles is fixed at 3300 mol. Therefore, the initial state must be consistent with n=3300 mol. So perhaps the initial state's pressure and temperature are given under real gas conditions. So I have to use the van der Waals equation at the initial state to find the pressure, but wait, the initial pressure is given as 100 atm. So maybe we can use that to find any necessary parameters, but perhaps it's unnecessary because the problem is about the final state at 500 K.

Wait, perhaps the problem is only asking about the pressure at 500 K, given that the volume is constant, and the mass is fixed. So the number of moles n is fixed at 3300 mol.

So, moving on, we can use the van der Waals equation at the final state (500 K) to compute P.

The van der Waals equation is:

\[ P = \frac{n R T}{V - n b} - a \frac{n^2}{V^2} \]

We can plug in the known values.

Given:
n = 3300 mol
R = 0.0821 dm³·atm/(mol·K)
T = 500 K
V = 1000 dm³
a = 1.39 dm^6·atm/mol²
b = 0.0391 dm³/mol

Let me compute each term step by step.

First, calculate the term (V - n b):

V = 1000 dm³
n b = 3300 mol * 0.0391 dm³/mol = 3300 * 0.0391 ≈ let's compute that.

3300 * 0.0391: 3000 * 0.0391 = 117.3, and 300 * 0.0391=11.73, so total 129.03 dm³.

So V - n b = 1000 - 129.03 ≈ 870.97 dm³.

Next, compute (n R T)/(V - n b):

n R T = 3300 * 0.0821 * 500

Let me compute that:

0.0821 * 500 = 41.05

3300 * 41.05 = ?

Well, 3000 * 41.05 = 123,150

300 * 41.05 = 12,315

So total is 123,150 + 12,315 = 135,465 dm³·atm

Divide by (V - n b) = 870.97 dm³:

135,465 / 870.97 ≈ Let me compute that.

Approximately:

870.97 ≈ 870

135,465 ÷ 870 ≈ Let's see:

870 * 155 = 870*(150+5) = 130,500 +4,350 = 134,850

So 870 * 155 ≈ 134,850

Subtracting from 135,465: 135,465 - 134,850 = 615.

So 615 / 870 ≈ 0.707

So total ≈ 155.707 atm.

So the first term is about 155.7 atm.

Now, the second term is a*(n²)/(V²):

a = 1.39 dm^6·atm/mol²

n² = (3300)^2 = 10,890,000 mol²

V² = (1000)^2 = 1,000,000 dm^6

So a*(n²)/(V²) = 1.39 * (10,890,000) / 1,000,000

Simplify the denominator: 1e6.

10,890,000 / 1e6 = 10.89

So 1.39 * 10.89 ≈ Let's compute:

1.39 * 10 = 13.9

1.39 * 0.89 = approx 1.2371

Total ≈ 13.9 + 1.2371 ≈ 15.137 atm.

So the second term is approximately 15.14 atm.

Putting it all together, the van der Waals equation gives:

P = (155.7 atm) - (15.14 atm) ≈ 140.56 atm.

Looking at the options, option F is 140 atm, which is very close.

Wait, but let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

First, n = 92.4 kg / 0.028 kg/mol = 3300 mol. Correct.

V = 1 m³ = 1000 dm³. Correct.

Compute (V - n b):

n*b = 3300 *0.0391 = 129.03 dm³. Correct.

V-nb = 1000 -129.03 = 870.97 dm³. Correct.

nRT = 3300 *0.0821 *500. Let me compute 0.0821 *500 =41.05. Then 3300*41.05:

3300 *40=132,000

3300 *1.05=3,465

Total =135,465 dm³·atm. Correct.

Divide by 870.97: 135465 ÷ 870.97 ≈ 155.7 atm. Correct.

Now the second term: a*(n²)/(V²)

n²=3300²=10,890,000.

V²=10^6.

So 10,890,000 /1e6=10.89.

Multiply by a=1.39: 1.39 *10.89.

Let me compute it accurately:

10.89 *1.39:

10 *1.39=13.9

0.89 *1.39: 0.8*1.39=1.112; 0.09*1.39=0.1251 → total 1.2371

So total is 13.9 +1.2371=15.1371 atm. Correct.

So P=155.7 -15.137≈140.56 atm. So approximately 140 atm.

Looking at the options, F is 140 atm. So the answer should be F.

To determine the pressure of nitrogen at 500 K using the van der Waals equation, we start by calculating the number of moles, \( n \), from the given mass. The molar mass of nitrogen (\( \text{N}_2 \)) is 28 g/mol, so:

\[
n = \frac{92.4 \, \text{kg}}{0.028 \, \text{kg/mol}} = 3300 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The van der Waals equation is:

\[
P = \frac{nRT}{V - nb} - a\frac{n^2}{V^2}.
\]

Given:
- \( n = 3300 \, \text{mol} \),
- \( R = 0.0821 \, \text{dm}^3 \, \text{atm} \, \text{mol}^{-1} \, \text{K}^{-1} \),
- \( T = 500 \, \text{K} \),
- \( V = 1000 \, \text{dm}^3 \),
- \( a = 1.39 \, \text{dm}^6 \, \text{atm} \, \text{mol}^{-2} \),
- \( b = 0.0391 \, \text{dm}^3 \, \text{mol}^{-1} \).

First, calculate \( V - nb \):

\[
nb = 3300 \times 0.0391 = 129.03 \, \text{dm}^3,
\]
\[
V - nb = 1000 - 129.03 = 870.97 \, \text{dm}^3.
\]

Next, calculate the first term:

\[
\frac{nRT}{V - nb} = \frac{3300 \times 0.0821 \times 500}{870.97} = \frac{135,465}{870.97} \approx 155.7 \, \text{atm}.
\]

Now, calculate the second term:

\[
\frac{a n^2}{V^2} = \frac{1.39 \times (3300)^2}{(1000)^2} = \frac{1.39 \times 10,890,000}{1,000,000} = 1.39 \times 10.89 \approx 15.14 \, \text{atm}.
\]

Finally, subtract the second term from the first:

\[
P = 155.7 - 15.14 \approx 140.56 \, \text{atm}.
\]

The closest option is **140 atm**.
