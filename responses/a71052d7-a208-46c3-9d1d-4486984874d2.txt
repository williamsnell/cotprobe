Okay, so I have this question here about calculating a refund for an insurance policy that was canceled 33 days after purchase. The annual premium is $37, and I need to figure out how much the refund would be. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that insurance policies usually prorate the premium when they're canceled. That means if you cancel partway through the year, you get a prorated refund based on how much time is left. So, the total premium is for a year, and the refund depends on how long the policy was active.

The policy was canceled 33 days after purchase. So, I need to calculate how much of the year has passed and how much is left. Wait, no, actually, the refund is based on the time remaining after cancellation. So, if it's canceled after 33 days, how many days are left in the annual period?

Assuming the annual period is 365 days, the policy was active for 33 days. So the remaining days would be 365 - 33 = 332 days. Therefore, the refund would be calculated based on the proportion of the year that's remaining.

So the formula should be (Remaining Days / Total Days) * Annual Premium. That makes sense because you're only paying for the time you used, so the refund is for the unused time.

Let me plug in the numbers. Remaining Days = 332, Total Days = 365. So 332/365 = approximately 0.90959. Now multiply that by the annual premium of $37.

Calculating that: 0.90959 * 37 ≈ 33.65. Hmm, that's around $33.65. Looking at the options, I see option J is $33.70, which is very close. So that must be the answer.

Wait, but sometimes insurance companies might calculate it differently, like using 360 days for the year instead of 365. Let me check that. 332/360 = 0.92222. 0.92222 *37 ≈ 34.12, which isn't one of the options. So I think the correct approach is to use 365 days.

Another way to think about it: If the policy is for a year, each day's cost is 37/365 ≈ $0.10137 per day. So for 33 days, the cost is 33 * 0.10137 ≈ $3.345. The total premium is $37, so the refund would be 37 - 3.345 ≈ $33.655, which rounds to $33.66. Again, the closest option is J: $33.70.

I don't think there's any other factor here, like a cancellation fee or anything, because the question is straightforward about the refund based on cancellation after 33 days. So yeah, the answer should be J.

The refund is calculated by prorating the annual premium based on the remaining days after cancellation. Using 365 days for the annual period, the remaining days are 332. The refund is (332/365) * $37 ≈ $33.66, which rounds to $33.70.

Answer: J
