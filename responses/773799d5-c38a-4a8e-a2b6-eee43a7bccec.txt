The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

Why did Mendel succeed in discovering the principlesof transmissions of hereditary traits, whereas others who had conducted such investigations had failed?

Options:

A: Mendel had a larger sample size than his contemporaries, which made his results statistically significant
B: Mendel's experiments were conducted over a longer period of time than those of other researchers, which gave him more data
C: Mendel studied the transmission of multiple traits at once
D: Mendel's success was purely due to luck
E: Mendel collaborated with other leading scientists of his time to develop his theories
F: Mendel's success was due to his background in mathematics, allowing him to see patterns that others missed
G: Mendel used advanced technology for his studies
H: Mendel was the first to use the scientific method in the study of heredity
I: Mendel had access to a secret garden with unique plant varieties that no one else had
J: Mendel's success was a combination of good experimental technique and luck. He studied one trait at a time, began with pure line plants, and luckily chose traits coded for by genes on different chromosomes.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out why Mendel succeeded in discovering the principles of hereditary trait transmission when others didn't. The question gives me a list of options from A to J, and I need to choose the correct one.

First, I remember that Mendel is famous for his work on pea plants. He used them because they were easy to grow, self-pollinate, and had clear traits. So, maybe his choice of plants helped. But looking at the options, I don't see anything about pea plants specifically, so I need to think about his methods.

Option A says Mendel had a larger sample size. That makes sense because a bigger sample can make results more reliable. But I'm not sure if that was the main reason. I think his sample size was large, but others might have had similar or even larger samples without the same success.

Option B mentions a longer experiment period. Mendel did take a long time, over several years, but again, others might have too. It's possible, but maybe there's a more specific reason.

Option C says he studied multiple traits at once. Wait, no, I remember Mendel started by studying one trait at a time. He focused on one characteristic, like seed shape, before moving to others. So studying multiple traits might have complicated things, which others did but didn't find the patterns. So C is probably not correct.

Option D says it was purely luck. That doesn't seem right because Mendel's approach was methodical. It was more about his techniques than luck alone.

Option E talks about collaborating with other scientists. I don't think Mendel had many collaborators; he did his work mostly on his own. So E is likely incorrect.

Option F suggests his math background helped him see patterns. That makes sense because Mendel had a strong mathematical foundation. He could analyze data statistically, which others might not have done as thoroughly. This seems plausible.

Option G says he used advanced technology. But during Mendel's time, the technology wasn't that advanced. He used simple equipment, so G is probably wrong.

Option H claims he was the first to use the scientific method in heredity. I'm not sure if that's accurate. I think others were doing experiments too, but maybe Mendel applied the scientific method more rigorously. But I'm not certain if this is the main reason for his success.

Option I mentions a secret garden with unique plants. That sounds like a myth or a distractor. There's no evidence of this, so I think I is incorrect.

Option J says his success was a combination of good technique and luck, studying one trait at a time, using pure line plants, and choosing traits on different chromosomes. Wait, I remember Mendel used purebred plants (pure lines) which ensured that the traits were homozygous. He studied one trait at a time, which allowed him to see clear patterns without the complications of multiple traits. Also, he used statistical methods to analyze his data, which made his results more reliable. Additionally, he chose traits that were easily distinguishable and that were controlled by genes on different chromosomes, meaning they were independently assorted. This combination of factors likely contributed to his success. So J seems to combine several correct elements.

Wait, but option F also points out his math background. So which is it? Mendel's mathematical approach was crucial because he could quantify the results and see ratios that others might have dismissed as too variable. However, option J includes his method of studying one trait at a time, which is a key point. Others might have tried multiple traits and gotten confused results, making their data less clear.

So, putting it all together, J seems to encompass several correct factors: good experimental technique (like using pure lines, studying one trait at a time), and perhaps some luck in choosing the right traits and approach. His mathematical skills (F) were part of his technique, but J includes more specific aspects of his method.

Therefore, the best answer is J.

Mendel's success can be attributed to his meticulous experimental design, including studying one trait at a time, using pure line plants, and choosing traits that were independently assorted. His mathematical background allowed him to analyze data statistically, providing clear patterns. These factors, combined with his rigorous approach, contributed to his discovery. 

Answer: J
