Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about the decomposition of N₂O₄ into NO₂. Hmm, I remember that this is a reversible reaction, and it's an example of a reaction where the reactant turns into products. The problem gives me the initial conditions and asks about the extent of decomposition based on the volume change.

Let me read the problem again. It says that at 273 K and 1 atm, 1 liter of N₂O₄ decomposes to NO₂. The reaction is N₂O₄ ⇌ 2 NO₂. The question is asking to what extent the decomposition has proceeded when the original volume is 25% less than the existing volume. Wait, that wording is a bit confusing. So, the original volume is now 25% less than the existing volume. So, let me parse that.

Wait, maybe I got that backwards. The original volume is the initial volume, which was 1 liter. The existing volume is the volume after decomposition. So, the original volume (1 L) is 25% less than the existing volume. That means the existing volume is larger than the original by 25%. So, existing volume = original volume + 25% of original. Oh wait, no. If original is 25% less than existing, that means original = existing * (1 - 0.25) = existing * 0.75. So, existing = original / 0.75. Original is 1 L, so existing volume is 1 / 0.75 = 1.333... liters. Oh, so the volume has increased because the reaction produces more moles of gas.

Wait, let me think again. The reaction is N₂O₄ ⇌ 2 NO₂. So, 1 mole of N₂O₄ becomes 2 moles of NO₂. So, the number of moles increases from 1 to 2, which doubles. So, the volume should increase because more moles mean more volume at the same temperature and pressure.

So, initially, we have 1 L of N₂O₄. Let's let x be the extent of decomposition in terms of moles. Wait, perhaps using the ideal gas law, but since temperature and pressure are constant, the volume is proportional to moles.

Wait, let me model this. Let’s define the initial moles of N₂O₄ as n. Since the volume is 1 L, and if we assume ideal gas, n = PV/RT. But since P, V, R, T are constant, the initial moles are 1 L * (1 atm / RT) → but maybe it's easier to just use moles proportionally.

Let’s say initially, we have 1 mole of N₂O₄ (since volume is 1 L, and for ideal gas, V = nRT/P, so n = V/(RT) = 1/(RT)). But since RT is constant, we can just think in terms of moles.

Let’s let the initial moles of N₂O₄ be 1 mole. So, the initial moles of N₂O₄ is 1, and moles of NO₂ is 0.

At decomposition, some of N₂O₄ decomposes into NO₂. Let’s say x moles of N₂O₄ decompose. Then, the moles of N₂O₄ left would be (1 - x), and the moles of NO₂ formed would be 2x (since each mole of N₂O₄ produces 2 moles of NO₂).

So, the total moles after decomposition would be (1 - x) + 2x = 1 + x.

Initially, the volume was 1 L. After decomposition, the volume is V. Since moles are proportional to volume at constant P and T, V = (n_total) * (RT/P) → but since RT/P is a constant, V ∝ n_total. So, initial moles were 1, leading to 1 L. After decomposition, moles are 1 + x, so volume is (1 + x) * (V_initial / n_initial) → V = (1 + x) * 1 L.

Wait, no. Wait, initial V is 1 L, which corresponds to n_initial =1 mole. After decomposition, n_total is 1 + x, so V = (1 + x) * (1 L / 1) )= 1 + x. So, V = 1 + x.

But the problem states that the original volume is 25% less than the existing volume. So, original volume (1 L) = existing volume - 25% of existing. So, 1 = V_existing - 0.25 V_existing → 1 = 0.75 V_existing → V_existing = 1 / 0.75 = 4/3 ≈ 1.333 L.

So, V_existing is 1.333 L. And since V = 1 + x → 1.333 = 1 + x → x = 0.333... So, x is approximately 0.333 moles.

But x is the moles of N₂O₄ that decomposed. The initial moles of N₂O₄ were 1, so the extent of decomposition is x/1 * 100% = 33.33...% → approximately 33%. So, the answer should be option A: 33% decomposition.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in setting up the equation. The problem states that the original volume is 25% less than the existing. So, original = existing - 0.25 existing → existing = original / 0.75 → existing = 1 / 0.75 ≈1.333 L. Then, the total moles after decomposition are (1 + x) = (V_existing) = 1.333. So, x = 0.333 moles. So, 33.3% of the initial N₂O₄ has decomposed. So, option A is correct.

But wait, another way to think about it: if the volume increases, that implies the reaction has proceeded. Since the initial volume is 1 L, and the volume after decomposition is larger, which matches our earlier conclusion.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider the reaction quotient or set up an ICE table. Let me try that approach.

Let me set up the ICE table.

Initial:
[N₂O₄] = 1 L (assuming concentration is in terms of volume, since pressure and temperature are constant).
[NO₂] = 0.

Change:
[N₂O₄] decreases by x. So, change is -x.
[NO₂] increases by 2x.

Equilibrium:
[N₂O₄] = 1 - x
[NO₂] = 2x

But wait, because the volume is changing, perhaps I should consider the total volume instead. Hmm, maybe a better approach is to track the moles and volume.

Wait, since the reaction occurs at constant temperature and pressure, the volume change is directly proportional to the number of moles. So, initial moles are 1 (n₁ =1), and after reaction, moles are n₂ = (1 - x) + 2x = 1 + x. So, the volume becomes V₂ = (n₂ / n₁) * V₁ = (1 + x) * 1 L = 1 + x L.

Given that V₂ is such that the original volume (1 L) is 25% less than V₂. So,

1 L = V₂ - 0.25 V₂ → 1 L = 0.75 V₂ → V₂ = 1 / 0.75 = 4/3 L ≈1.333 L.

So, 1 + x = 4/3 → x = 1/3 ≈0.333. So, x is 1/3 of the initial moles of N₂O₄. So, the extent of decomposition is 33.3%, which is option A.

Wait, but let me think again. The problem says, what extent has decomposition proceeded when the original volume is 25% less than the existing volume. So, the original is less than the existing by 25%. So, existing is larger than the original by 1/0.75 - 1 = 0.333, which is 33.3% increase. So, the volume has increased by 33.3%, which comes from the reaction producing more moles.

So, the decomposition has proceeded to the extent that 33.3% of the N₂O₄ has decomposed. So, the answer is option A: 33% decomposition.

At 273 K and 1 atm, 1 liter of N₂O₄ decomposes into NO₂ according to the reaction N₂O₄ ⇌ 2NO₂. The problem states that the original volume (1 L) is 25% less than the existing volume after decomposition. This implies that the existing volume is 1 / 0.75 = 1.333 L. 

Since the reaction increases the number of moles of gas (1 mole of N₂O₄ produces 2 moles of NO₂), the volume increases proportionally. Let x represent the moles of N₂O₄ that decompose. Initially, there are 1 mole of N₂O₄ and 0 moles of NO₂. After decomposition, the moles of N₂O₄ are (1 - x), and the moles of NO₂ are 2x. The total moles after decomposition are (1 - x) + 2x = 1 + x. 

The volume after decomposition is proportional to the total moles, so V_existing = 1 + x. Given that V_existing = 1.333 L, we solve 1 + x = 1.333, yielding x = 0.333. Thus, 33.3% of the initial N₂O₄ has decomposed. 

The extent of decomposition is therefore 33%, corresponding to option A.
