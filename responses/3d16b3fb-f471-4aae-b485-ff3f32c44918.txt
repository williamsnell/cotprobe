Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to find the pH of a solution made by dissolving hypochlorous acid in water. Hmm, hypochlorous acid is HClO, right? I remember it's a weak acid because it doesn't completely dissociate in water. 

The problem states that 0.1665 moles of HClO are dissolved in enough water to make 500 mL of solution. The Ka given is 3.0 × 10^-4. I think I need to find the pH, so I'll probably have to calculate the concentration first and then use the Ka to find the H+ ions.

Wait, first step is to find the concentration of HClO. Molarity is moles divided by liters. So the volume is 500 mL, which is 0.5 liters. So the molarity (M) would be 0.1665 mol / 0.5 L = 0.333 M. Right, because 0.1665 divided by 0.5 is 0.333, so approximately 0.333 M.

Now, since HClO is a weak acid, it won't completely ionize. The ionization equation is HClO ↔ H+ + ClO-. The expression for Ka is [H+][ClO-] / [HClO]. Since the acid is weak, the change in concentration of HClO will be small, so we can make some approximations.

Let me set up an ICE table (Initial, Change, Equilibrium). Initial concentrations: [HClO] = 0.333 M, [H+] and [ClO-] are both 0. Change: Let's say x is the amount that dissociates. So [H+] increases by x, [ClO-] increases by x, and [HClO] decreases by x.

At equilibrium: [H+] = x, [ClO-] = x, [HClO] = 0.333 - x. Since Ka is 3.0 × 10^-4, which is small, x should be much smaller than 0.333, so I can approximate 0.333 - x ≈ 0.333. That simplifies the equation.

So plugging into Ka: (x)(x) / 0.333 = 3.0e-4. That becomes x² = 0.333 * 3.0e-4. Let's calculate that. 0.333 * 3 is about 0.999, so 0.999e-4 is approximately 9.99e-5. So x² = 9.99e-5. Taking square root, x ≈ sqrt(9.99e-5). Let's see, sqrt(1e-4) is 0.01, but 9.99e-5 is a bit less. Hmm, maybe around 0.009995, which is about 0.00999. So x ≈ 0.00999 M.

Wait, but wait a second. The H+ concentration is x, so pH = -log[H+]. Let's compute that. So [H+] is approximately 0.00999 M, which is 9.99e-3. Taking log: log(9.99e-3) is log(1e-2) is -2, but 9.99 is almost 10, so log(10e-3) is -2. So 9.99e-3 is 0.999 * 10e-3, so log(0.999) is almost 0, so log(9.99e-3)= approx -2.00, so pH is 2.00. Wait, but wait, double-checking the calculation.

Wait, 0.00999 is 9.99 × 10^-3. So pH is -log(9.99e-3). Let me compute that more accurately. Log(9.99) is about 0.9995, so log(9.99e-3) is 0.9995 -3 = -2.0005. So pH is 2.0005, which would round to 2.00. So the pH is approximately 2.00.

Looking at the options, option B is 2. So the answer should be B. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make any miscalculations. Let's recalculate x squared: 0.333 * 3e-4 is 0.333 * 3 = 0.999, so 0.999e-4 is 9.99e-5. So x is sqrt(9.99e-5) which is sqrt(9.99)*1e-2.5? Wait, sqrt(1e-4) is 0.01, so sqrt(9.99e-5) is sqrt(9.99)*1e-2.5? Wait, maybe I should compute it numerically. Let me compute sqrt(9.99e-5) exactly.

So 9.99e-5 is 0.0000999. The square root of 0.0000999. Well, sqrt(0.0001) is 0.01, so sqrt(0.0000999) is a bit less than that. Let me compute it: 0.009995 approximately. So x is about 0.009995 M, which gives [H+] as 0.009995, so pH is about 2.0002, so 2.00.

But wait, maybe I should use more precise calculations. Let me compute x² = 0.333 * 3e-4 = 0.333 * 0.0003 = 0.0000999. So x = sqrt(0.0000999) = 0.009995. So [H+] is 0.009995, which is 9.995e-3. pH is -log(9.995e-3) = ?

Using log(9.995e-3) = log(9.995) + log(1e-3) = 0.99977 + (-3) = -2.00023. So pH is 2.00023, which rounds to 2.00. So the pH is approximately 2.00, which is option B.

Wait, but wait, another thought. Did I account for the stoichiometry correctly? The initial concentration was 0.333 M, and the change is x, so yes, the approximation holds because 0.333 is much larger than x (~0.01). So the approximation is valid.

Alternatively, maybe I should check if the 5% rule holds, meaning that x is less than 5% of the initial concentration. 0.01 / 0.333 is about 0.03, which is 3%, so yes, less than 5%, so the approximation is valid.

Therefore, the pH is approximately 2.00, so the correct answer is B.

To determine the pH of the solution, the first step is to calculate the molarity of hypochlorous acid (HClO). Given 0.1665 moles dissolved in 500 mL (0.5 L), the molarity is:

\[
\text{Molarity} = \frac{0.1665 \, \text{mol}}{0.5 \, \text{L}} = 0.333 \, \text{M}.
\]

Since HClO is a weak acid, it partially ionizes in water:

\[
\text{HClO} \leftrightharpoons \text{H}^+ + \text{ClO}^-.
\]

Using the equilibrium expression for the acid dissociation constant \( K_a = 3.0 \times 10^{-4} \), the equilibrium concentrations are defined as follows:

- Initial: \([HClO] = 0.333 \, \text{M}, [H^+] = 0, [ClO^-] = 0\),
- Change: \([HClO] \text{ decreases by } x, [H^+] \text{ and } [ClO^-] \text{ increase by } x\),
- Equilibrium: \([HClO] = 0.333 - x, [H^+] = x, [ClO^-] = x\).

The equilibrium expression becomes:

\[
K_a = \frac{[H^+][ClO^-]}{[HClO]} = \frac{x^2}{0.333 - x}.
\]

Since \( K_a \) is small, \( x \) is much smaller than 0.333, so \( 0.333 - x \approx 0.333 \). This simplifies the equation to:

\[
x^2 = 0.333 \times 3.0 \times 10^{-4} = 9.99 \times 10^{-5}.
\]

Solving for \( x \):

\[
x = \sqrt{9.99 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 0.009995 \, \text{M}.
\]

The concentration of \( [H^+] \) is approximately \( 0.009995 \, \text{M} \). The pH is calculated as:

\[
\text{pH} = -\log[H^+] = -\log(0.009995) \approx 2.00.
\]

Thus, the pH of the solution is approximately 2.00, corresponding to option **B**.
