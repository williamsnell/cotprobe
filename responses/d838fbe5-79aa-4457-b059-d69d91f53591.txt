Question:

Images and sounds are maintained in sensory memory for:

Options:

A: less than 5 seconds.
B: 30 to 45 seconds.
C: only while the sensory input is present.
D: 10 to 15 seconds.
E: exactly 5 minutes.
F: about 60 to 90 seconds.
G: minutes to days, depending on the depth of encoding.
H: an hour to a day.
I: until the information is transferred to short-term memory.
J: an indefinite period of time.

Okay, so I have this question about sensory memory and how long images and sounds are maintained there. Hmm, I remember that sensory memory is the first step in processing information, right? It's like the initial stage where we register what's happening around us through our senses.

Wait, I think sensory memory is really short. Like, it's just a quick snapshot. I remember something about it being less than a second for some types of memory, but maybe a bit longer for others. Oh right, there's iconic memory for visual stuff and echoic memory for sounds. Iconic memory is like the afterimage you see when something flashes, and echoic memory is that echo-like sound that lingers after hearing something.

So the question is asking how long are these maintained? The options are A through J. Let me look at the options again. Option A is less than 5 seconds. That sounds familiar. I think iconic memory lasts for a fraction of a second, but maybe up to a couple of seconds. Option D is 10-15 seconds, which seems longer. Option C says only while the input is present, which might be more like the initial registration, not the duration after the input stops.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. I think sensory memory doesn't store information for very long. So if the input stops, how long does it stay? I remember reading that it's very brief, like a few seconds at most. So maybe A is correct because it's less than 5 seconds. Or perhaps it's a bit longer, like 10-15 seconds? Or maybe it's about how long you can hold onto that memory after the input is gone.

I think the key is that sensory memory is the immediate registration, and it decays very quickly. So images and sounds aren't held for more than a few seconds. Let me think about the options again. Option C says only while the input is present, which doesn't fit because even after the input stops, you can still have a lingering memory for a moment.

So, for example, if you see a flash of light, the afterimage stays for a second or two. Similarly, hearing a sound might leave an echo. So it's probably a few seconds, but not more than that. So looking at the options, A is less than 5 seconds, which seems right. Option D is 10-15, which might be too long for sensory memory.

Wait, but I also recall that some sources say sensory memory can last up to about 2-3 seconds for visual and a bit longer for auditory. Maybe up to 4 or 5 seconds. So A says less than 5, which would include that. So I think A is the correct answer. The other options like F (60-90 seconds) or G and H are way too long, those are for longer-term memory. Option I is about transferring to short-term memory, which is a process but not the duration itself. So yeah, I'll go with A.

The question asks about the duration for which images and sounds are maintained in sensory memory. Sensory memory, which includes iconic memory for visuals and echoic memory for sounds, is known for its brevity. It captures immediate sensory information but retains it for only a short period. Iconic memory, for example, lasts a fraction of a second up to about 2-3 seconds, while echoic memory might linger slightly longer but still within a few seconds. 

Analyzing the options, A states "less than 5 seconds," which aligns with the understanding that sensory memory is very brief. Other options, like D (10-15 seconds), F (60-90 seconds), G, H, I, and J, refer to durations that are too long for sensory memory, which is transient by nature. Option C, "only while the sensory input is present," is incorrect because sensory memory persists for a moment even after the input ceases. Therefore, the correct answer is A.

Answer: A
