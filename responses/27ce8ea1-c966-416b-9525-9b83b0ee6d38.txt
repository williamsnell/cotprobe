Question:

In DNA adenine normally pairs with:

Options:

A: protein.
B: cytosine.
C: thymine.
D: guanine.
E: nucleotide.
F: adenine.
G: ribose.
H: phosphate.
I: deoxyribose.
J: uracil.

Answer:

Okay, so I've got this question about DNA, and I need to figure out what adenine pairs with. Hmm, I remember that DNA is made up of nucleotides, and each nucleotide has a sugar, a phosphate, and a nitrogenous base. The bases are the key here because they're what form the bonds in the double helix.

Wait, the question is about adenine. I think adenine is one of the four main bases in DNA. The four are adenine, thymine, cytosine, and guanine. Oh right, in DNA, adenine always pairs with thymine. I remember learning that in Watson and Crick's model, adenine forms two hydrogen bonds with thymine. Then, in RNA, instead of thymine, it's uracil that pairs with adenine, right?

So looking at the options, the choices are A through J. Let me read them again. Option C is thymine, which I think is correct. Option J is uracil, which would be the RNA pairing, so not the answer here. So the correct pairing for adenine in DNA is thymine, which is option C.

I should double-check the options to make sure I'm not mixing anything up. The other options don't make sense. Proteins are not involved in pairing; they're more about structure and function elsewhere. Cytosine pairs with guanine, so option B is cytosine, which pairs with guanine, not adenine. So yeah, option C is definitely the right answer.

In DNA, adenine pairs with thymine through two hydrogen bonds. Among the options given, thymine corresponds to option C.

Answer: C
