Answer:
    
<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out the desired level of money balances when aggregate income is $1,600 billion per annum. The question says that members wish to hold money balances equal to 5 weeks of expenditure, and all income is spent. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

First, I remember that the demand for money is often related to transactions. People hold money to facilitate their spending over a certain period. Since all income is spent, the money balance they want is based on their spending needs over a specific time frame—in this case, 5 weeks.

So, aggregate income is $1,600 billion annually. I guess that's the total income, which would be like the GDP or total income in the economy. Now, to find the desired money balances, I think I need to calculate how much they want to hold each week and then multiply by 5.

Wait, but how do I get the weekly expenditure? Well, if all income is spent, then the total expenditure per year is the same as the aggregate income, right? So, if the annual income is $1,600 billion, then the weekly expenditure would be a fraction of that.

Let me calculate the number of weeks in a year to find the weekly amount. There are 52 weeks in a year. So, the weekly expenditure would be the annual income divided by 52.

So, $1,600 billion per year divided by 52 weeks. Let me do that math: 1,600 / 52 equals approximately 30.769 billion per week. Wait, that's 30.769 billion dollars each week.

But the question is about holding money for 5 weeks. So, they want to hold enough money to cover 5 weeks of expenditure. That means I multiply the weekly amount by 5.

So, 30.769 billion times 5 equals about 153.846 billion dollars. That seems like a lot, but given the numbers, it's correct.

Looking at the options, A is $153,846 billion, which matches my calculation. But wait, did I make a mistake in the decimal placement? Let me check. 1,600 divided by 52 is approximately 30.76923077 billion per week. Multiply that by 5 gives 153.8461538 billion. So yeah, that's approximately $153,846 billion. But wait, that's 153.846 billion, not 153,846. Oh, maybe I misread the options. Let me check again.

Option A is $153,846 billion. That's way too high. Wait, 153.846 billion is 0.153846 trillion. 153,846 billion would be 153.846 trillion, which doesn't make sense because the annual income is only 1.6 trillion. So I must have made a mistake in the calculation somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I misunderstood the question. The question says the desired level of money balances is equal to 5 weeks of expenditure. So, if the total income is 1,600 billion per year, then the total expenditure is also 1,600 billion annually because all income is spent.

Wait, but money demand is usually a function of income and the frequency of transactions. So, if they want to hold money for 5 weeks, that's like saying the money demand is (5/52) of annual income.

Let me recalculate. 5 weeks out of 52 weeks is 5/52 of the annual income. So, 5/52 * 1,600 billion.

Calculating that: 1,600 * 5 = 8,000. Then 8,000 / 52 ≈ 153.846 billion. So, the desired money balances would be approximately $153.846 billion.

Looking back at the options, option A is $153,846 billion, which is way too big. Wait, perhaps I misread the options. Let me check again. Oh, wait, option I is $30,769 billion. That's about 30.769 billion, which is the weekly amount. So 5 times that would be 153.846 billion, which isn't an option as is. Wait, looking at the options again, A is 153,846, which is 153.846 billion? No, wait, no. Wait, 153,846 billion is 153.846 trillion, which can't be right because the annual income is 1.6 trillion. So perhaps I'm miscalculating something.

Wait, maybe I got the units wrong. Let me think again. The annual income is $1,600 billion. That's 1.6 trillion. So, 1,600 billion is 1.6e3 billion, or 1.6 trillion.

Wait, perhaps I should think of it as 1,600 billion divided by 52 weeks gives weekly expenditure. So, 1,600 / 52 ≈ 30.769 billion per week. Then 5 weeks would be 30.769 *5 ≈153.846 billion.

Looking at the options, option A is 153,846 billion, which is 153.846 trillion, which is way too high. So that can't be right. Therefore, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, maybe the question is asking for the money balances, which is the average amount they hold. Wait, no, the question says they want to hold money balances equal to 5 weeks of expenditure. So, the total money they hold should be equal to 5 weeks' worth of spending.

So, if their annual income is $1,600 billion, and they spend it all, their weekly spending is 1,600 /52 ≈30.769 billion. So, 5 weeks is 153.846 billion. That's 153.846 billion dollars. Now, looking at the options, option A is 153,846 billion, which is 153.846 trillion. That's 100 times higher than what I calculated. So perhaps I'm missing a step.

Wait, maybe the question is annual money balances, so perhaps I need to annualize it differently. Wait, no, because 5 weeks is a fraction of the year, so the money balances would be that fraction of the annual income.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the flow of money, so maybe it's the total amount held, not the flow. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A: $153,846 billion, but that seems way too high. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the division. Let me recalculate.

1,600 divided by 52: 52 times 30 is 1,560, so 30 with a remainder of 40. 40/52 is approximately 0.769. So, 30.769 billion per week. 5 weeks is 30.769 *5 = 153.846 billion. So, that's 153.846 billion, which is 153,846 million. But the options are in billions. So, 153.846 billion is the correct figure.

Looking at the options again, none of them exactly match 153.846 billion. Wait, option A is 153,846 billion, which is 153.846 trillion. That's way too high. So perhaps I made a mistake in the problem understanding.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the money demand as a function of transactions. So, money demand (M) is equal to (T * t), where T is the total transactions, and t is the time between transactions. Or maybe it's a different formula.

Alternatively, maybe the money demand is (k * Y), where k is the fraction of income held as money. If they hold 5 weeks of expenditure, which is (5/52) of annual income.

So, M = (5/52) * Y, where Y is 1,600 billion.

So, M = (5/52)*1,600 = (8,000)/52 ≈153.846 billion.

So, that's 153.846 billion, which would be option A if it were 153.846 billion, but option A is 153,846 billion, which is 100 times higher. Wait, perhaps I misread the options. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A: $153,846 billion

B: $307,692 billion

C: $10,400 billion

D: $5,000 billion

E: $80,000 billion

F: $160,000 billion

G: $123,077 billion

H: $200,000 billion

I: $30,769 billion

J: $1,600 billion

Wait, 153.846 billion is 153,846 million. So, 153.846 billion equals 153,846 *1,000 million? No, wait, 1 billion is 1,000 million. So, 153.846 billion is 153,846 million. But the option A is written as $153,846 billion, which would be 153,846 *1,000 million, which is 153.846 trillion, which is way too high.

So, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation, or perhaps the options have a typo. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the total money in the economy, not per person or something. But no, the question states the aggregate income is $1,600 billion. So, the total money balances desired would be 5 weeks of expenditure, which is 5/52 of the annual income.

So, 1,600 *5/52 = 153.846 billion. So, that's the correct figure. But none of the options match exactly. Wait, option A is 153,846 billion, which is 153.846 trillion, which is way bigger than 1,600 billion. So, that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the division. Let me calculate 5/52 of 1,600 billion more carefully.

5 divided by 52 is approximately 0.0961538. So, 0.0961538 *1,600 = ?

1,600 *0.0961538 ≈ 153.84608 billion. So, that's correct.

Looking at the options again, perhaps option A is a typo, and they meant 153.846 billion, but it's written as 153,846 billion, which would be incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, maybe the question is asking for the money demand in terms of velocity. Wait, velocity of money is the number of times money circulates, which is T/Y. But I don't think that's relevant here.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the demand for money as a stock, which is (k * Y), where k is the fraction. So, k=5/52, Y=1,600, so M=5/52 *1,600=153.846 billion.

So, the correct answer should be 153.846 billion, which isn't exactly an option. Wait, looking at the options again, option A is $153,846 billion, which is 153.846 trillion, which is 100 times higher. So perhaps the correct option is not present, but the closest is option A if the comma is a typo. Alternatively, perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, maybe the annual income is $1,600,000 million, which is 1.6 trillion, but in the question, it's $1,600 billion, which is 1.6 trillion. So, the calculation stands.

Alternatively, perhaps the question intended to say 5 weeks of income, not expenditure. But the question says expenditure, so I think my approach is correct.

Wait, perhaps the options are in thousands of billions, so 153.846 billion is 153,846 million, which would be 153.846 billion. So, the option A is 153,846 billion, which is 153.846 trillion, which is way too high. So, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the question is about the average money held, not the total. But no, the question says the desired level of money balances, which is the total they want to hold.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think of it as 5 weeks of income. If income is 1,600 billion per year, then weekly income is 1,600 /52 ≈30.769 billion. So, 5 weeks would be 153.846 billion. So, same result.

I think the correct answer is 153.846 billion, but the options don't have that. Wait, looking again, option A is 153,846 billion, which is 153.846 trillion. That's way too high, so perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options. But that can't be. Maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the average money held, which would be (5/52)*Y. So, 153.846 billion. So, the correct answer is 153.846 billion, which is option A if it were written correctly. But since option A is 153,846 billion, which is 153.846 trillion, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, perhaps the question is not about annual income but monthly. No, the question says $1,600 billion per annum.

Alternatively, perhaps the calculation is 5 weeks of income, but that would be the same as 5 weeks of expenditure if all income is spent.

I think I've spent enough time on this. The correct calculation leads me to 153.846 billion, which isn't directly an option. But the closest is option A, which is written as 153,846 billion, but that's way too high. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake and the correct answer is option I: $30,769 billion, which is the weekly amount. But the question asks for 5 weeks, so 5 times that would be 153.846 billion.

Wait, perhaps the options have a typo, and the correct answer is option A: 153,846 billion, but that's 153.846 trillion, which doesn't make sense because the annual income is 1.6 trillion. Therefore, perhaps the correct answer is option C: $10,400 billion, which is 10.4 trillion, but that's not matching my calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should check the calculation again. 5/52 of 1,600 billion is:

5/52 = 0.0961538

0.0961538 * 1,600 = 153.846 billion.

So, that's correct. Therefore, the correct answer should be 153.846 billion, but the options don't have that. Wait, looking again, option A is 153,846 billion, which is 153.846 trillion. That's 100 times higher than needed. So perhaps I made a mistake in the division.

Wait, 1,600 divided by 52 is approximately 30.769 billion per week. 5 weeks is 153.846 billion. So, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the options are in thousands of millions, not billions. No, the options are in billions.

I think the correct answer is 153.846 billion, but since it's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option A, assuming a typo in the comma placement. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option I: $30,769 billion, which is the weekly amount. But the question asks for 5 weeks, so that can't be.

Wait, perhaps I'm misreading the options. Let me check again.

Option A: $153,846 billion

Option I: $30,769 billion

So, 153,846 billion is 153.846 trillion, which is 100 times higher than the correct figure. So, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but with a typo in the comma. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that 5 weeks is 5/52 of a year, so the money held is 5/52 of the annual income.

So, M = (5/52)*1,600 = 153.846 billion.

So, that's correct. Therefore, the correct answer is 153.846 billion, which is option A if it were correctly written as $153.846 billion, but it's written as $153,846 billion, which is incorrect. So, perhaps the intended answer is option A, assuming a typo.

Alternatively, perhaps the question intended to say that the desired level is 5 weeks' worth of income, not expenditure. But the calculation would be the same because all income is spent.

I think I've spent enough time on this. The correct calculation leads me to 153.846 billion, which is not an option, but the closest is option A, which is written incorrectly. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option I, which is 30,769 billion, but that's only one week. Since the question asks for 5 weeks, I think the intended answer is option A, despite the typo.
</think>

The question asks for the desired level of money balances when aggregate income is $1,600 billion per annum, assuming members wish to hold money balances equal to 5 weeks of expenditure and all income is spent. 

To calculate this, we first determine the weekly expenditure by dividing the annual income by the number of weeks in a year (52 weeks). This gives:

\[
\text{Weekly expenditure} = \frac{1,600 \text{ billion}}{52} \approx 30.769 \text{ billion}
\]

Since the desired money balances are for 5 weeks, we multiply the weekly expenditure by 5:

\[
\text{Desired money balances} = 30.769 \times 5 \approx 153.846 \text{ billion}
\]

Looking at the options provided, the closest match to this calculation is **Option A: $153,846 billion**. However, there appears to be a discrepancy in the formatting of the option, as $153,846 billion represents $153.846 trillion, which is inconsistent with the calculated value of $153.846 billion. Despite this, based on the calculation and the given options, **Option A** is the most appropriate choice.

**Answer: A**
