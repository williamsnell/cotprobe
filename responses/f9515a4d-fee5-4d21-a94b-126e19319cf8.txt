Okay, so I have this question about perceived volume of a tone and what determines it. The options are from A to J. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that sound has several characteristics, like pitch, loudness, and quality. The question is about perceived volume, which I think relates to how loud a sound is. So I'm trying to recall what each term means.

Option A is duration. That's how long the sound lasts. I don't think that directly affects how loud it is, though maybe a longer duration might seem louder if it's sustained, but I'm not sure if that's the main factor.

Option B is pitch. Pitch is about how high or low the note is, which relates to frequency. So pitch doesn't directly determine loudness.

C is timbre, which is the quality of the sound, like the difference between a violin and a piano playing the same note. Timbre affects how we recognize the instrument but not the loudness.

D is frequency, which is the same as pitch. So that's about the note's highness or lowness, not volume.

E is velocity. Hmm, velocity in music terms refers to how fast or slow the note is played, but I think it's more about dynamics (loudness) in some contexts. Or maybe it's related to how hard a key is pressed on a piano, which affects amplitude.

F is wavelength, which is related to frequency. Longer wavelength means lower pitch, but again, not directly about volume.

G is amplitude. I'm pretty sure amplitude is the measure of the sound wave's height, which directly relates to how loud the sound is. So higher amplitude means louder sound, which would determine the perceived volume.

H is overtones. These are additional frequencies above the fundamental pitch. They affect the timbre more than the loudness.

I is echo. That's about reflections of sound, not the loudness itself.

J is resonance, which refers to the reinforcement of sound frequencies in a space. It can affect how the sound is perceived, but I'm not sure it's the main determinant of volume.

So putting it together, the perceived volume is mainly determined by amplitude because that's what affects the loudness. So the answer should be G.

The perceived volume of a tone is primarily determined by its amplitude, as amplitude directly relates to the loudness of the sound. 

Answer: G
