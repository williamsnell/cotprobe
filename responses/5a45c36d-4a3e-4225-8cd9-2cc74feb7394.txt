Okay, so I need to figure out what percentage of the world's land area is forested as of 2015. The options are A through J, with numbers ranging from 10% up to 70%. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I remember that forests cover a significant portion of the Earth, but not the majority. Let me think step by step.

First, I know that Earth's total land area is about 148.9 million square kilometers. Forests, as per some data I've seen before, cover a large chunk of that. I think it's around 30% or so. Wait, but I'm not 100% sure. Let me try to recall any specific figures.

I remember that around the turn of the century, maybe 2000 or 2005, the forest cover was about 31%. But I'm not certain if that's the same as in 2015. Forests can change over time due to deforestation and reforestation efforts. I'm not sure if the percentage has increased or decreased since then.

Let me consider the options again. The choices are A:70% (too high, that's more than two-thirds), B:35% (a bit higher than what I thought), C:20% (seems low), D:60% (also high), E:15% (too low), F:50% (could be possible?), G:40%, H:10% (way too low), I:30% (close to what I thought), J:45% (a bit higher than my recollection).

I think the correct figure is around 30-35%. But wait, I've also heard that by 2020, it was around 31-32%. So 2015 might be similar. That would point to option I:30%. But another thought: maybe it's 31% as of 2015, so 30% is close enough.

Alternatively, I'm a bit confused because sometimes the data includes different definitions. For example, some sources might include different types of forests or calculate it differently. But I think the general consensus is that forests cover about 30-35% of the Earth's land area.

Wait, but another angle: the world's total forest area is about 4 billion hectares. Let me calculate that. 4 billion hectares divided by the total land area of ~148.9 million km². Wait, 1 hectare is 0.01 km², so 4 billion hectares is 40 million km². So 40 million / 148.9 million is roughly 26.8%. Hmm, that's about 27%, which would be closer to 30% when rounding. But wait, that math doesn't add up because 40 million divided by 148.9 million is approximately 0.268, so 26.8%, which is roughly 27%. So that would suggest the answer is around 27%, which isn't an option here. The closest option is I:30% or J:45% is too high.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check again. 4 billion hectares is 4,000,000,000 hectares. 1 hectare is 0.01 km², so 4e9 hectares = 4e8 km². The world's land area is about 148.9 million km², which is 1.489e8 km². So 4e8 / 1.489e8 ≈ 2.689, so about 269%, which can't be right because you can't have more than 100% coverage. Wait, that can't be correct. Oh wait, no, I think I messed up the exponents. Let me calculate it properly.

4e9 hectares = 4,000,000,000 hectares. Since 1 km² = 100 hectares, then 4e9 hectares = 4e7 km². The world's land area is about 148.9 million km², which is 1.489e8 km². So 4e7 / 1.489e8 = 0.268, so 26.8%. So that's about 27%, which is close to 30%. So the closest option is I:30%.

But wait, another thought: maybe the data I'm recalling is outdated. For example, in 2015, maybe the percentage was slightly higher. Alternatively, perhaps I'm confusing the global forest area with the Amazon or other regions. I'm not entirely sure, but based on this calculation, 27% would round to 30%, so I think the answer is I:30%.

The correct answer is I: 30%.
