Question:

An assembly line machine is supposed to turn out ball bearings with a diameter of 1.25 centimeters. Each morning the first 30 bearings produced are pulled and measured. If their mean diameter is under 1.23 centimeters or over 1.27 centimeters, the machinery is stopped and an engineer is called to make adjustments before production is resumed. The quality control procedure may be viewed as a hypothesis test with the null hypothesis H0: μ = 1.25 and the alternative hypothesis Ha: μ ≠ 1.25. The engineer is asked to make adjustments when the null hypothesis is rejected. In test terminology, what would a Type II error result in?

Options:

A: An incorrect assumption about the machinery's calibration
B: An unnecessary stoppage of the production process
C: Continued production of wrong size ball bearings
D: An unnecessary adjustment of the machinery
E: A warranted halt in production to adjust the machinery
F: A false alarm about the size of ball bearings
G: Continued production of proper size ball bearings

Alright, so I need to figure out what a Type II error would result in for this hypothesis testing scenario. Let me break it down step by step.

Okay, the setup is an assembly line machine that's supposed to produce ball bearings with a diameter of 1.25 cm. Every morning, the first 30 bearings are measured. If their average is less than 1.23 cm or more than 1.27 cm, they stop production and call an engineer to adjust the machinery. 

In hypothesis testing terms, the null hypothesis (H0) is that the mean diameter μ is 1.25 cm. The alternative hypothesis (Ha) is that μ is not equal to 1.25 cm. So, they're testing whether the mean is off by those thresholds.

Now, the question is about Type II errors. From what I remember, a Type II error occurs when the null hypothesis is not rejected when it's actually false. So, in other words, failing to detect a genuine difference or issue.

In this context, if the machinery is actually producing bearings with a mean diameter different from 1.25 cm, but the sample mean falls within the 1.23 to 1.27 range, the quality control team wouldn't stop production. They'd think everything's fine (failing to reject H0) even though there's a problem. 

So what's the consequence of that? The machinery is still producing bearings that are off the desired size, but they're not being stopped. That would mean the wrong size bearings are being made and shipped out without any intervention. 

Looking at the options:

A: Incorrect assumption about calibration. Hmm, maybe, but Type II is more about failing to detect an issue, not necessarily the assumption itself.

B: Unnecessary stoppage. No, that's Type I error—rejecting H0 when it's true. So stopping production when it's not needed.

C: Continued production of wrong size. Yes, that fits. Because Type II is not stopping when there's a problem.

D: Unnecessary adjustment. That's more like a Type I error leading to an adjustment when it's not needed.

E: Warranted halt. That's when they correctly stop production, which is the opposite of a Type II error.

F: False alarm. Again, that's Type I, where they stop production when it's not needed.

G: Continued proper production. That's the correct action when everything is fine, but not related to Type II.

So the correct answer should be C: Continued production of wrong size ball bearings.

In this scenario, a Type II error occurs when the machinery is producing ball bearings with a mean diameter different from 1.25 cm, but the sample mean falls within the acceptable range of 1.23 to 1.27 cm. This leads to the failure to reject the null hypothesis (H0: μ = 1.25), resulting in the continued production of incorrectly sized ball bearings without any adjustments. Therefore, the correct answer is:

C: Continued production of wrong size ball bearings.

Answer: C
