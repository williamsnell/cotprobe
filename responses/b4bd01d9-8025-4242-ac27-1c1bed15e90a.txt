Question:

A liquid flows at a constant flow rate through a pipe with circular cross-sections of varying diameters. At one point in the pipe, the diameter is 2 cm and the flow speed is 18 m/s. What is the flow speed at another point in this pipe, where the diameter is 3 cm?

Options:

A: 10 m/s
B: 18 m/s
C: 14 m/s
D: 8 m/s
E: 20 m/s
F: 4 m/s
G: 16 m/s
H: 12 m/s
I: 6 m/s
J: 22 m/s

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about fluid flow in a pipe with varying diameters. Hmm, I remember something about the continuity equation from my studies. Let me think. The continuity equation states that the volume flow rate remains constant in an incompressible fluid, right? So, the product of the cross-sectional area and the flow speed should stay the same at different points in the pipe.

Wait, the problem says the flow is at a constant flow rate, so yeah, that makes sense. The pipe has circular cross-sections, so the area depends on the diameter. Oh wait, the area of a circle is πr², but since diameter is given, I can write it as π*(d/2)², which simplifies to πd²/4. So area is proportional to the square of the diameter.

Let me jot down what I know. At the first point, the diameter is 2 cm, which is 0.02 meters. The flow speed there is 18 m/s. At the second point, the diameter is 3 cm, which is 0.03 meters. I need to find the flow speed there.

Using the continuity equation: A1 * v1 = A2 * v2. Since A is proportional to d², I can write (d1²) * v1 = (d2²) * v2. Because the π/4 factor cancels out when taking the ratio.

So plugging in the numbers: (0.02 m)² * 18 m/s = (0.03 m)² * v2. Let me compute each part.

First, 0.02 squared is 0.0004, multiplied by 18 gives 0.0072. On the other side, 0.03 squared is 0.0009, so 0.0009 * v2 equals 0.0072. To find v2, divide both sides by 0.0009. 0.0072 / 0.0009 is 8. So v2 is 8 m/s.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations. Maybe I should compute it step by step again to avoid mistakes. 

Alternatively, since the diameters are 2 cm and 3 cm, the ratio of the areas is (d1/d2)² = (2/3)² = 4/9. Since A1*v1 = A2*v2, then v2 = v1*(A1/A2) = 18*(4/9) = 8 m/s. Yep, that's the same result. So the flow speed at the second point is 8 m/s. Looking at the options, option F is 4 m/s, which is half of 8, but that's not right. Option D is 8 m/s, so that's the correct choice.

The flow speed at the second point is 8 m/s, which corresponds to option D.

Answer: D
