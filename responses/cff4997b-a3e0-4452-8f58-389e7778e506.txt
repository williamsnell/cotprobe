Okay, so I've got this genetics problem about pigeons and their feather patterns. Hmm, let me try to figure this out. The question involves a dihybrid cross, right? The parents are a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird. 

Wait, the genes involved are C and c for the checkered pattern, and B and b for the color. C is dominant for checkered, and c is recessive for plain. B is dominant for red, and b is recessive for brown. So the parents are CCBB (homozygous checkered red) and ccbb (plain brown). 

First, let me think about the F1 generation. When you cross CCBB with ccbb, the F1 should all be CcBb. Because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. So Cc for the C gene (since CC gives C and cc gives c) and Bb for the B gene (BB gives B and bb gives b).

Now, the next step is the F1 x F1 cross. So CcBb × CcBb. To find the phenotypes and ratios in the F2, I need to consider each gene separately and then combine them.

For the C gene: Cc × Cc. The possible gametes are C and c. So the Punnett square for C would be CC (25%), Cc (50%), and cc (25%). Since C is dominant, the phenotypes would be Checkered (CC and Cc) and Plain (cc). So 75% checkered and 25% plain.

For the B gene: Bb × Bb. Similarly, the gametes are B and b. The Punnett square gives BB (25%), Bb (50%), and bb (25%). B is dominant, so Red (BB and Bb) is 75% and Brown (bb) is 25%.

Now, since these two genes are independent (I assume they assort independently), the F2 phenotypes are combinations of the two traits. Let's cross the possibilities:

Checkered (C_ ) can combine with Red (B_ ) or Brown (bb).
Plain (cc) can also combine with Red or Brown.

So the possible phenotypic combinations are:
1. Checkered Red
2. Checkered Brown
3. Plain Red
4. Plain Brown

The phenotypic ratio is determined by multiplying the probabilities of each phenotype.

For Checkered Red: (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16
Checkered Brown: (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16
Plain Red: (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16
Plain Brown: (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, wait. No, I think I messed that up. Because each gene is independent, the phenotypic ratio is (3:1 for C) multiplied by (3:1 for B). So the combined ratio is 9 (3*3) checkered red, 3 (3*1) checkered brown, 3 (1*3) plain red, and 1 (1*1) plain brown. So the ratio is 9:3:3:1.

Wait, but wait, no. Wait, for each gene, it's 3:1 in terms of phenotypes. So when combining, the total phenotypic ratio is 9 checkered red : 3 checkered brown : 3 plain red : 1 plain brown. So 9+3+3+1=16 parts.

Looking at the options, option C says: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That matches the 9:3:3:1 ratio. So the phenotypic ratio would be 9:3:3:1.

Wait, but let me double-check. The F2 comes from crossing CcBb × CcBb. Each gene is independently assorting. So for each gene, the F2 will have a 3:1 ratio phenotypically. So for two traits, it's a dihybrid cross, leading to 9:3:3:1 phenotypic ratio.

So the correct phenotypic ratio should be 9 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 3 plain red, 1 plain brown. So looking at the options, option C is the one that matches this.

Wait, let me check the options again. Option C: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Yep, that's correct.

Wait, but wait another thing. The question mentions the F2 generation, which comes from F1 × F1. So our analysis is correct because we considered the F1 cross.

So the answer should be option C.
</think>

The dihybrid cross involves parents CCBB (homozygous checkered red) and ccbb (plain brown). The F1 generation is all CcBb. Crossing F1 × F1 (CcBb × CcBb), we analyze each gene separately. For the C gene (checkered/plain), the F2 phenotypic ratio is 3:1 (checkered:plain). For the B gene (red/brown), the ratio is also 3:1 (red:brown). Combining these, the phenotypic ratio for F2 is 9:3:3:1 (checkered red:checkered brown:plain red:plain brown). This matches option C.
