Okay, so I need to figure out the answer to this multiple-choice question about Gauthier's foundational crisis in morality. Let me start by recalling what I know about Gauthier and his work. 

David Gauthier was a philosopher known for his work in ethics, particularly his book "Moral Rights and Maximal Well-Being," where he discussed the foundations of ethics. I remember that he talked about a foundational crisis in morality, which he saw as a problem with traditional ethical theories.

The question is asking what this crisis essentially involves. The options given are various ethical theories and concepts. Let me go through each option to see which one fits.

Option A: Consequentialism. That's the idea that the consequences of an action determine its morality, like utilitarianism. I'm not sure if this is the one Gauthier was referring to as being in crisis.

Option B: Justified constraint. Hmm, I'm not too familiar with this term. Maybe it's about constraints that are justified morally? Not sure yet.

Option C: Pure altruism. That's about selfless concern for others. I don't think Gauthier's crisis is about altruism specifically.

Option D: Divine command theory. This is the idea that moral rules are commands from a divine source. Gauthier might critique this, but is the crisis about this theory?

Option E: Virtue ethics. Focuses on developing good character. I don't think this is directly related to the foundational crisis he's talking about.

Option F: Deontological ethics. This is about duties and rules, like Kant's approach. Gauthier might have issues with this as part of the crisis.

Option G: Moral relativism. The idea that morality is relative to culture or situation. Not sure if this is the focus.

Option H: Prima facie duties. These are duties that appear to be binding at first glance but might be overridden. Gauthier might discuss this, but is it the crisis?

Option I: Enlightened egoism. This is the idea that acting in one's self-interest is the basis of morality, but in a rational and long-term way. I think Gauthier supports this as a solution to the foundational crisis.

Wait, the question is about what the crisis involves, not what he proposes as a solution. So the crisis is about the failure of traditional theories. I remember that Gauthier argues that traditional deontological theories (like Kant's) and consequentialist theories (like utilitarianism) face a foundational crisis because they can't provide a stable basis for morality. He suggests that instead, a form of enlightened egoism can serve as the foundation.

So the foundational crisis involves both deontological and perhaps other theories. Looking at the options, the question asks which one it essentially involves. But the options are singular.

Wait, the options are individual theories. So the crisis involves one of these as being problematic. Alternatively, perhaps the crisis is that these theories can't ground morality, so the correct answer would be the type of theory that is in crisis.

Alternatively, maybe the foundational crisis is about the lack of a foundation, so perhaps the answer is deontological ethics (F) or something else.

Wait, I think Gauthier's argument is that both deontological and consequentialist theories are facing a crisis because they can't provide a solid foundation. But the options don't have a combination. So perhaps the question is more about what the crisis is about. Maybe it's about the lack of a foundation, so the answer is that the crisis involves the failure of these traditional theories.

Alternatively, the question is phrased as "the morality that Gauthier describes as facing a foundational crisis essentially involves." So it's about which moral theory is in crisis. Since Gauthier is critical of both deontological and consequentialist approaches, but perhaps the main one he discusses is deontological.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. Gauthier's foundational crisis is about the inability of traditional ethical theories to provide a solid basis for moral judgment. He argues that both deontological ethics (which focus on duties) and consequentialism (which focus on outcomes) have problems. He suggests that instead, a form of enlightened egoism, which is a version of egoism that is rational and long-term, can serve as the foundation.

So the foundational crisis is that these traditional theories (like deontological ethics) are failing, so the answer would be F: deontological ethics.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Another angle: the question says "the morality that Gauthier describes as facing a foundational crisis." So it's about the nature of the crisis. Maybe the crisis is about the justification of moral constraints. So option B: justified constraint.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to recall. Gauthier's main point is that traditional theories can't provide a foundation because they rely on either consequences or duties without a solid grounding. He thinks that a contractarian approach, based on rational self-interest, can provide the foundation. So the crisis is in the traditional approaches, particularly deontological ethics.

So the answer is F: deontological ethics.
</think>

The foundational crisis in morality, as described by Gauthier, centers on the failure of traditional ethical theories to provide a stable and rational basis for moral judgment. Gauthier critiques both deontological ethics, which focuses on duties and rules, and consequentialism, which prioritizes outcomes, for their inability to ground morality effectively. He argues that these theories lack a solid foundation, leading to the crisis. Among the options provided, deontological ethics (F) is the theory that Gauthier identifies as facing this foundational crisis.

Answer: F
