Okay, so I'm trying to solve this thermodynamics problem. Let's read through it carefully.

We have a system with 2.0 moles of CO₂ gas initially at 25°C (which is 298.15 K) and 10 atm pressure. The gas is in a cylinder with a cross-section of 10.0 cm². It's allowed to expand adiabatically against an external pressure of 1.0 atm until the piston moves outward by 20 cm. CO₂ is considered a perfect gas, and Cv,m is given as 28.8 J/(K·mol). We need to calculate the work done, w.

Wait, but wait—the expansion is adiabatic, so no heat exchange (q=0). For an adiabatic process, the first law says ΔU = w. But since the process is against an external pressure, it's likely an expansion, so work done by the system is negative (since work done on the surroundings is positive in convention, but in the formula, work done by the system is negative).

Hmm, but wait, for expansion work, the formula is usually w = -P_ext * ΔV. But wait, in this case, the process is adiabatic, so we might need to calculate the change in volume and use that to find the work. Alternatively, maybe we can find the final volume and then compute the work.

Wait, wait, but wait a second: in an adiabatic process for an ideal gas, the work done is related to the change in internal energy. Since it's adiabatic, ΔU = w. But also, for an ideal gas, ΔU = n Cv,m ΔT. So, if I can find the change in temperature, I can find w.

But wait, to find the temperature change, I might need to know how much the volume changes because the work is done against the external pressure. Hmm, perhaps I need to calculate the initial and final volumes.

Let me outline the steps I think I need to take:

1. Calculate the initial volume of the gas.
2. Calculate the final volume after expansion.
3. Compute the work done using w = -P_ext * (V_final - V_initial), but wait, is that the right approach? Wait, no, because the expansion is adiabatic, so the work done is the integral of P dV, but if it's against a constant external pressure, maybe we can approximate it as P_ext * ΔV.

Wait, but wait, in an adiabatic process, the work done is actually related to the change in internal energy, so for an ideal gas, w = -n Cv ΔT.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the work as the external pressure times the change in volume. Let me think.

First, let's compute the initial volume. The initial pressure is 10 atm, and the number of moles is 2.0 mol. Using the ideal gas law, PV = nRT, so V = (nRT)/P.

R is 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K), right? So T is 298.15 K.

So V_initial = (2.0 mol * 0.0821 L·atm/mol·K * 298.15 K) / 10 atm.

Let me compute that: 2 * 0.0821 is about 0.1642. Multiply by 298.15, which is roughly 0.1642 * 300 ≈ 49.26 L·atm. Wait, no, wait, 298.15 is approximately 298, so 0.1642 * 298 ≈ 48.96 L·atm. Then divide by 10 atm, so V_initial ≈ 4.896 L, which is 4896 cm³.

Wait, the cross-section of the cylinder is 10.0 cm², so the initial height h_initial is V_initial / (cross-section area). Wait, V is area times height, so h_initial = V_initial / (10 cm²) = 4896 cm³ / 10 cm² = 489.6 cm. Wait, that seems really long, but maybe that's correct.

Wait, but wait, when the piston moves outward by 20 cm, the final height is h_initial + 20 cm. So h_final = 489.6 + 20 = 509.6 cm.

Then, the final volume V_final is area * h_final = 10 cm² * 509.6 cm = 5096 cm³, which is 5.096 L.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial volume calculation. Let me recheck.

Wait, R is 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K), n=2, T=298.15 K, P=10 atm.

So V_initial = (2 * 0.0821 * 298.15) / 10.

Compute numerator: 2 * 0.0821 ≈ 0.1642. 0.1642 * 298.15 ≈ let's compute 0.1642 * 300 = 49.26, minus 0.1642 * 1.85 ≈ 0.303. So approximately 49.26 - 0.303 ≈ 48.957 L·atm. Then divide by 10 atm, so 4.8957 L, which is 4895.7 cm³, so about 4896 cm³. That seems correct.

So initial volume is 4.896 L.

After expansion, the volume is 5.096 L. So ΔV = 0.2 L, which is 200 cm³.

Wait, but wait, 5.096 - 4.896 = 0.2 L, which is 200 cm³. So the change in volume is 200 cm³, or 0.2 L.

Now, the external pressure is 1.0 atm. So the work done by the gas is w = -P_ext * ΔV.

Wait, but wait, is that correct? Because in an expansion, the gas is doing work on the surroundings, so work is negative from the system's perspective. So w = - P_ext * (V_final - V_initial).

But wait, in this case, the expansion is adiabatic, and the work done is against the external pressure. So perhaps we can model the work as w = -P_ext * ΔV.

So w = -1.0 atm * 0.2 L = -0.2 L·atm.

Convert that to joules: 1 L·atm ≈ 101.325 J.

So 0.2 L·atm ≈ 20.265 J. So w ≈ -20.265 J, which would be approximately -20 J. But that's not one of the options exactly. Wait, option G is -20 J. Hmm.

Wait, but wait—am I sure that's the correct approach? Because in an adiabatic process, the work done is related to the internal energy change. So perhaps I'm missing something here.

Alternatively, perhaps the process isn't isobaric, so the work can't be calculated simply as P_ext * ΔV. Wait, but in reality, when a gas expands against a constant external pressure, the work done is w = -P_ext * ΔV, regardless of whether it's adiabatic or not. Because that's the definition of work done against a constant external pressure.

Wait, but in an adiabatic process, the work done is equal to the change in internal energy, so w = -ΔU. And for an ideal gas, ΔU = n Cv ΔT. But I'm not sure if that's necessary here.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the work using the external pressure and volume change, as I did before, which gives me around -20.26 J, which would round to -20 J, corresponding to option G.

But looking at the options, G is -20 J. However, another approach might be to compute the work using the adiabatic condition.

Wait, maybe the expansion is free, but no—it's expanding against an external pressure, so it's not free expansion. Free expansion would be against zero pressure, and work would be zero. Here, the external pressure is 1 atm.

Hmm, so perhaps the initial approach is correct. Let me check the calculations again.

Wait, let me make sure about the volume change. Initial volume is 4.896 L, final is 5.096 L. So ΔV is 0.2 L. P_ext is 1 atm, so work is -1 * 0.2 * 101.325 ≈ -20.265 J.

So that's about -20 J, which is option G.

Wait, but let me think again: in an adiabatic process, the work done is equal to the change in internal energy. So ΔU = n Cv ΔT = w.

If I compute the work as -20 J, then ΔU is -20 J, so Cv is 28.8 J/(mol·K), and n=2, so ΔU = 2 * 28.8 * ΔT = -20 J.

So 2 * 28.8 = 57.6. So 57.6 * ΔT = -20 → ΔT = -20 / 57.6 ≈ -0.3472 K.

So the temperature would decrease by about 0.347 K. Does that make sense? But maybe that's a separate check.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for work in terms of pressure and volume. Wait, but if the process is adiabatic, and the gas expands, it's doing work, so the internal energy decreases, hence the temperature drops.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The initial approach seems straightforward: compute the change in volume and multiply by external pressure to find work.

Wait, but another thought: in an adiabatic process, the work done is given by w = (P_initial V_initial - P_final V_final) / (γ-1), where γ is Cp/Cv.

Wait, but I don't know P_final and V_final, except that the expansion stops when the piston has moved 20 cm. So perhaps I can't use that formula directly.

Alternatively, perhaps the process is such that the external pressure is constant, so the work is simply P_ext * ΔV, but with a negative sign.

So, given that, the calculation would be w = -1.0 atm * (5.096 - 4.896) L = -1.0 * 0.2 L·atm.

Convert to J: 0.2 L·atm * 101.325 J/(L·atm) ≈ 20.265 J. So w ≈ -20.265 J, which is approximately -20 J.

Looking at the options, G is -20 J. So that's the answer.

But wait, let me make sure about the volume change. The cross-section is 10 cm², and the piston moves 20 cm. So the change in volume is 10 cm² * 20 cm = 200 cm³, which is 0.2 L. So yes, ΔV is 0.2 L.

Therefore, the work done is -1 atm * 0.2 L = -0.2 L·atm = -20.265 J.

So the answer is G: -20 J.

The problem involves calculating the work done during the adiabatic expansion of 2.0 moles of CO₂ gas from an initial state of 10 atm and 25°C (298.15 K) to a final state where the piston has moved outward by 20 cm. The gas expands against a constant external pressure of 1.0 atm. 

### Key Steps:
1. **Initial Volume Calculation**:  
   Using the ideal gas law, \( V = \frac{nRT}{P} \):  
   \[
   V_{\text{initial}} = \frac{(2.0 \, \text{mol})(0.0821 \, \text{L·atm/mol·K})(298.15 \, \text{K})}{10 \, \text{atm}} \approx 4.896 \, \text{L}.
   \]

2. **Final Volume Calculation**:  
   The piston moves outward by 20 cm, and the cross-sectional area of the cylinder is \( 10.0 \, \text{cm}^2 \). The change in volume is:  
   \[
   \Delta V = 10.0 \, \text{cm}^2 \times 20.0 \, \text{cm} = 200 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.2 \, \text{L}.
   \]  
   Thus, \( V_{\text{final}} = V_{\text{initial}} + \Delta V = 4.896 \, \text{L} + 0.2 \, \text{L} = 5.096 \, \text{L} \).

3. **Work Calculation**:  
   The work done during the expansion against a constant external pressure is given by:  
   \[
   w = -P_{\text{ext}} \Delta V.
   \]  
   Substituting \( P_{\text{ext}} = 1.0 \, \text{atm} \) and \( \Delta V = 0.2 \, \text{L} \):  
   \[
   w = -(1.0 \, \text{atm})(0.2 \, \text{L}) = -0.2 \, \text{L·atm}.
   \]  
   Converting to joules using \( 1 \, \text{L·atm} \approx 101.325 \, \text{J} \):  
   \[
   w \approx -0.2 \times 101.325 \, \text{J} \approx -20.265 \, \text{J}.
   \]  
   Rounding to the nearest option, \( w \approx -20 \, \text{J} \).

### Conclusion:
The work done during the expansion is approximately \( -20 \, \text{J} \), corresponding to option **G**.
