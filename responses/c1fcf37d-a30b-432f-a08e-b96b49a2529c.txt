Question:

A ten-year-old boy, tested with a paper-and-pencil intelligence test, obtained an IQ score of 130. Two years later, he was tested with an alternate form of the same test. Most likely, the obtained score on the second testing would be

Options:

A: 130, but with a significant decrease in subtest scores
B: more than 130
C: 140, indicating significant intellectual growth
D: 130
E: 130, but with a different pare of subtest scores
F: less than 130
G: 130, but with a significant increase in subtest scores
H: 100, showing a significant drop in intelligence quotient
I: 120, indicating a decrease in intellectual capabilities
J: Unpredictable as the test used was different

Okay, so I've got this question about IQ tests and how scores might change over time, especially for a ten-year-old. Let me try to break this down step by step. 

First, the question says a ten-year-old boy took a paper-and-pencil intelligence test and scored an IQ of 130. Two years later, he was tested again with an alternate form of the same test. The question is asking what his score would most likely be on the second test.

I remember that IQ tests are standardized, meaning they have norms based on a large sample of people. The average IQ is 100, and scores usually follow a bell curve. So scoring 130 is above average, probably in the gifted range.

Now, the key here is that the second test is an alternate form of the same test. Alternate forms are usually designed to be equivalent to the original, meaning they measure the same abilities but with different questions. The idea is that they should yield similar scores if a person's abilities haven't changed.

I think about test-retest reliability. If a test is reliable, a person's score should be consistent over time, assuming their abilities haven't changed. However, there are factors like mood, test anxiety, or even the day's circumstances that can affect performance. But over two years, especially for a child, some changes in performance might occur, but since it's an alternate form, the expectation is that the score should be similar.

Looking at the options:

A: 130, but with a significant decrease in subtest scores. That would imply the total score stayed the same, but subtests dropped. Not sure why subtests would change if the form is alternate.

B: More than 130. Possible if he improved, but without specific info on improvement, it's unlikely.

C: 140, which is a big jump. Probably not unless he developed a lot in two years, which isn't indicated.

D: 130. This seems plausible because alternate forms should give similar scores.

E: 130, but with different parts. Maybe, but the question is about the overall score, not the subtest distribution.

F: Less than 130. Possible if he had a bad day, but again, the alternate form should be similar.

G: 130, but higher subtests. Not sure why that would happen.

H: 100, that's a huge drop. Unlikely without major issues.

I: 120, a significant drop. Again, unless something changed, which isn't suggested.

J: Unpredictable because the test was different. But it's an alternate form, so it should be similar.

So, the most likely answer is D: 130. The alternate form should yield a similar score, assuming no significant changes in the child's abilities. The other options suggest changes that aren't supported by the information given.

The most likely score on the second testing would be 130, as alternate forms of a test are designed to be equivalent, yielding similar scores if the individual's abilities haven't changed. 

Answer: D
