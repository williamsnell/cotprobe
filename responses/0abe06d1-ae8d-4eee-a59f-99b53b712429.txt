Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question says that a certain reaction is nonspontaneous under standard conditions but becomes spontaneous at higher temperatures. I need to figure out what that implies about the Gibbs free energy, enthalpy, and entropy under standard conditions.

Hmm, I remember that Gibbs free energy (ΔG) determines the spontaneity of a reaction. If ΔG is negative, the reaction is spontaneous; if it's positive, it's nonspontaneous. So under standard conditions, the reaction is nonspontaneous, which means ΔG is positive. So I'm looking for options where ΔG > 0.

Now, the reaction becomes spontaneous at higher temperatures. That means when T increases, ΔG must become negative. I think the formula ΔG = ΔH - TΔS is key here. Since the reaction goes from nonspontaneous to spontaneous with higher T, the term TΔS must be affecting the equation.

Let me think: At higher T, if ΔG becomes negative, then the change in TΔS must cause the overall ΔG to go from positive to negative. So, when T increases, the TΔS term becomes more significant. Let's break it down.

Under standard conditions, ΔG = ΔH - TΔS. Since ΔG is positive, that implies ΔH - TΔS > 0. Now, when temperature increases, to make ΔG negative, the TΔS term must be subtracting a larger positive number, making the whole expression negative. So, TΔS must be positive and increasing, which implies that ΔS is positive because T is positive.

Wait, but that's not possible because if ΔS is positive, then at higher T, TΔS would be more positive, making ΔG = ΔH - TΔS go down. So for ΔG to go from positive to negative with increasing T, ΔH must be positive, and ΔS must be positive as well. Let me see why.

Wait, no. Let me think again. If ΔS is positive, then as T increases, TΔS becomes a larger positive number. So if ΔH is positive, then ΔG = (positive) - (larger positive). So for ΔG to become negative, the TΔS term must be bigger than ΔH. That happens at higher T, meaning that the reaction becomes spontaneous when T is high enough.

Wait, let me put this into equations. Suppose under standard conditions (T1), ΔG is positive: ΔH - T1ΔS > 0. At higher T (T2), ΔG becomes negative: ΔH - T2ΔS < 0.

So, rearranging the first inequality: ΔH > T1ΔS.

From the second inequality: ΔH < T2ΔS.

Since T2 > T1, and both T are positive, the only way for ΔH to be greater than T1ΔS and less than T2ΔS is if ΔS is positive because when T increases, TΔS increases, allowing the second inequality to hold.

Wait, but if ΔS is positive, then as T increases, TΔS increases, so the second inequality (ΔH < T2ΔS) can hold if ΔH is positive. Let me see:

From the first inequality, ΔH > T1ΔS. Since ΔS is positive, T1ΔS is positive. So ΔH must be positive and larger than T1ΔS. But when T increases, T2ΔS is larger than T1ΔS, so if ΔH is positive, there comes a point where T2ΔS > ΔH, making ΔG negative.

So, in this scenario, ΔH must be positive, ΔS must be positive, and ΔG is positive under standard conditions.

Wait, but let me check the options. Looking at the options, let's see which ones match ΔH > 0, ΔS > 0, and ΔG > 0 under standard conditions.

Looking at the options:

A: ΔH = 0, ΔS > 0, ΔG >0. Hmm, but if ΔH is zero, then ΔG = -TΔS. If ΔS is positive, then at higher T, ΔG becomes more negative. So under standard conditions, if T is lower, say T is standard (25°C?), then ΔG would be negative because TΔS is positive, so ΔG = 0 - TΔS would be negative. But the reaction is nonspontaneous, which requires ΔG>0, so this doesn't fit. So A is out.

B: ΔH >0, ΔS <0, ΔG>0. Wait, but if ΔS is negative, then as T increases, TΔS becomes more negative, so ΔG = ΔH - TΔS becomes ΔH plus a positive number (since TΔS is negative, subtracting it is adding). So ΔG would get larger, making it even more positive, which would make the reaction less likely to be spontaneous at higher T. But the question says it becomes spontaneous at higher T, which would require ΔG to become negative. So B is not correct.

C: ΔH>0, ΔS=0, ΔG>0. If ΔS=0, then ΔG=ΔH. So ΔG would be positive regardless of T, meaning the reaction is always nonspontaneous. But the question says it becomes spontaneous at higher T, so C is wrong.

D: ΔH>0, ΔS>0, ΔG=0. Wait, ΔG=0 would mean the reaction is at equilibrium. But the question says it's nonspontaneous under standard, which would require ΔG>0, so D is out.

E: ΔH=0, ΔS<0, ΔG>0. Similar to A, but ΔS is negative. If ΔH=0, then ΔG=-TΔS. If ΔS is negative, then ΔG would be positive at any T, because -TΔS would be positive. But that would mean the reaction is always nonspontaneous, which isn't the case because it becomes spontaneous at higher T. So E is incorrect.

F: ΔH<0, ΔS=0, ΔG>0. If ΔH is negative and ΔS=0, then ΔG=ΔH, which is negative. But the question says under standard conditions, ΔG is positive. So F is out.

G: ΔH>0, ΔS>0, ΔG>0. This matches what I thought earlier. ΔH is positive, ΔS is positive, and under standard conditions, ΔG is positive. So this fits. Let me check the other options to be sure.

H: ΔH<0, ΔS>0, ΔG<0. Then, under standard conditions, ΔG would be negative, making the reaction spontaneous, which contradicts the question. So H is out.

I: ΔH<0, ΔS<0, ΔG=0. Doesn't fit because ΔG=0 implies equilibrium, and the question says it's nonspontaneous (ΔG>0) under standard conditions.

J: ΔH<0, ΔS<0, ΔG>0. So ΔH is negative and ΔS is negative. Under standard conditions, ΔG=ΔH - TΔS. Since ΔH is negative and ΔS is negative, TΔS is negative, so subtracting a negative is adding. So ΔG would be more negative, which makes the reaction spontaneous, but the question says it's nonspontaneous. So J is out.

So the only option that fits is G: ΔH>0, ΔS>0, ΔG>0 under standard conditions.

The reaction is nonspontaneous under standard conditions, meaning ΔG > 0. At higher temperatures, it becomes spontaneous, implying ΔG < 0. Using the equation ΔG = ΔH - TΔS, we analyze the conditions:

1. Under standard conditions, ΔG = ΔH - TΔS > 0. This suggests ΔH > TΔS.
2. At higher temperatures, ΔG = ΔH - TΔS < 0. This implies ΔH < TΔS.

For both conditions to hold, ΔH must be positive, and ΔS must be positive. A positive ΔS ensures that as T increases, TΔS grows, eventually making ΔG negative. Among the options, only G satisfies ΔH > 0, ΔS > 0, and ΔG > 0 under standard conditions.
