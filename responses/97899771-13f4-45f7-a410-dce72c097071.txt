Okay, so I have this electrochemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about designing an electrochemical cell using a specific setup: Li | LiCl (fused salt) | Cl₂. The goal is to find the optimum ratio of the weight of lithium (Li) to chlorine gas (Cl₂). The options are given from A to J, and I need to choose the correct one.

First, I remember that electrochemical cells work based on redox reactions. So, I should probably figure out what reactions are happening at the anode and cathode here. 

Li is a metal, so I think it would likely act as the anode where oxidation occurs. The Cl₂ is probably the cathode where reduction happens. Let me write down the possible half-reactions.

At the anode (oxidation): Li metal would lose electrons to become Li⁺ ions. The reaction would be Li → Li⁺ + e⁻. That makes sense because metals usually oxidize.

At the cathode (reduction): Cl₂ gas would gain electrons to become Cl⁻ ions. The reaction would be Cl₂ + 2e⁻ → 2Cl⁻. That's the standard reduction for chlorine.

So combining these, the overall cell reaction would be Li reacting with Cl₂ to form LiCl. Let me write that out: 2Li + Cl₂ → 2LiCl. That looks right because each Li contributes one electron, and Cl₂ takes two, so it balances.

Now, the question is about the weight ratio of Li to Cl₂. Since it's asking for the ratio by weight, I'll need to calculate the moles involved and then convert that to grams.

Looking at the balanced equation: 2 moles of Li react with 1 mole of Cl₂. So the molar ratio is 2:1. But wait, the question is about weight, not moles. So I need to convert the moles to grams using the atomic weights provided.

The atomic weight of Li is 6.94 g/mol, and Cl is 35.5 g/mol. Since Cl₂ is diatomic, the molar mass for Cl₂ is 2 * 35.5 = 71 g/mol.

So, for 2 moles of Li: 2 * 6.94 = 13.88 grams.
For 1 mole of Cl₂: 71 grams.

The ratio of Li weight to Cl₂ weight would be 13.88 / 71. Let me calculate that. 13.88 divided by 71 is approximately 0.1955. Hmm, looking at the options, option B is 0.196, which is very close to this value.

Wait, but let me double-check. Did I get the ratio right? The question asks for the weight of Li to Cl₂, so yes, Li is the numerator and Cl₂ is the denominator. So 13.88/71 ≈ 0.1955, which rounds to 0.196. That's option B.

I think that makes sense. The balanced equation gives a 2:1 mole ratio, and when considering their molar masses, the weight ratio is around 0.196. So the correct answer should be B.

The electrochemical cell involves the reaction 2Li + Cl₂ → 2LiCl. The molar ratio of Li to Cl₂ is 2:1. Using their atomic weights (Li = 6.94 g/mol, Cl₂ = 71 g/mol), the weight ratio is calculated as (2 × 6.94) / 71 ≈ 0.196. 

Answer: B
