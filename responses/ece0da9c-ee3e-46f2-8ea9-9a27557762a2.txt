Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the forced current i_forced in a circuit. The circuit setup is a voltage source in series with a resistor and a capacitor. The voltage source is given as 60 cos(1000t) volts. The resistor is 2 kΩ, which is 2000 Ω, and the capacitor is 1 μF, which is 1e-6 farads.

Hmm, I remember that when dealing with AC circuits, especially with resistors and capacitors in series, I should probably look into using phasors or the concept of impedance. Since it's a forced current, I think this is referring to the steady-state response, so I can ignore any transient parts.

First, let's recall the basics. In a series R-C circuit under AC conditions, the impedance Z is given by the formula Z = R + (1/(jωC)). Here, ω is the angular frequency, which in this case is 1000 rad/s because the voltage is 60 cos(1000t). 

So, let me compute the impedance. The resistor is R = 2000 Ω. The capacitor's reactance Xc is 1/(ωC). Plugging in the numbers: ω is 1000, C is 1e-6 F. So Xc = 1/(1000 * 1e-6) = 1/(0.001) = 1000 Ω. But since it's a capacitor, the reactance is negative in the imaginary part. So Xc = -j1000 Ω.

So the total impedance Z is R + Xc = 2000 - j1000 Ω.

Now, the current i is the voltage divided by impedance. The voltage here is 60 cos(1000t) V, which as a phasor is 60 ∠0° volts. But wait, when using phasors, we usually represent AC voltages as complex exponentials, but for the purpose of calculating current, I can think of it as a phasor with magnitude 60 and angle 0 degrees.

So the current I is V divided by Z. Let me compute that. V is 60 V (since it's the amplitude), and Z is (2000 - j1000) Ω. So I = 60 / (2000 - j1000).

To compute this, I can convert the denominator into polar form. Let's find the magnitude and angle of Z first. The magnitude |Z| is sqrt(2000² + (1000)²) = sqrt(4,000,000 + 1,000,000) = sqrt(5,000,000) = approximately 2236.07 Ω.

The angle θ of Z is arctangent of (Xc/R) but since Xc is negative (capacitive), the angle will be below the real axis. So θ = arctan( (1000)/2000 ) = arctan(0.5) ≈ 26.565 degrees. But since it's in the fourth quadrant (because Xc is negative), the angle is -26.565 degrees or 360 - 26.565 = 333.435 degrees.

So Z in polar form is approximately 2236.07 ∠-26.565° Ω.

Now, the current I is V/Z. V is 60 ∠0°, so I = 60 / (2236.07 ∠-26.565°) = (60 / 2236.07) ∠ (0° - (-26.565°)) ) = (≈0.02683) ∠26.565°.

Wait, let me compute the magnitude: 60 / 2236.07 ≈ 0.02683 A, which is 26.83 mA.

The angle is 26.565 degrees, so the phasor form is I = 26.83 ∠26.565° mA.

But the options are given in terms of cos and sin terms, which suggests using the rectangular form. So I need to convert this phasor into a combination of cosine and sine functions.

The rectangular form is I = I_m cos(ωt) + I_n sin(ωt), but wait, let me think. Alternatively, using Euler's formula, a phasor I = I_m ∠θ can be written as I_m cos(θ) - j I_m sin(θ), but wait, in terms of time, it's I = I_m cos(ωt + θ) or something like that. Wait, perhaps I should express it as a combination of cosine and sine with the same frequency.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me approach it differently. The current I can be written as I = (60 / Z) * e^{j0} divided by e^{-j26.565°}, which would be e^{j26.565°}. So the current's phasor is 60/(2236.07) ∠26.565°, which is about 0.02683 ∠26.565° A, which is 26.83 ∠26.565° mA.

Wait, but wait, when you divide by a complex number, the angles subtract. So I think I might have made a mistake earlier. Let me redo this part.

Wait, the formula is I = V / Z. V is 60 ∠0°, Z is (2000 - j1000) which is 2236.07 ∠-26.565°. So when you divide, the magnitude is 60 / 2236.07 ≈ 0.02683, and the angle is 0° - (-26.565°) = +26.565°. So the current's phasor is 0.02683 ∠26.565°, which is about 26.83 mA with a phase of 26.565 degrees.

But how do I convert this into a sine and cosine form? Wait, the general form is I(t) = I_m cos(ωt + φ), but sometimes it's expressed as a combination of sine and cosine. Alternatively, using the rectangular form as (I_r + jI_i), which would translate to I_r cos(ωt) - I_i sin(ωt), because the imaginary part comes from the sine component.

Wait, another approach: when you have a phasor I = I_m ∠θ, this can be written as I_m cos(θ) + j I_m sin(θ) in rectangular form. But in terms of time dependence, it's I(t) = I_m cos(ωt + θ), but perhaps I'm mixing up the steps.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to represent the current as I(t) = I_r cos(ωt) + I_i sin(ωt), where I_r and I_i are the real and imaginary parts of the phasor current.

Wait, but let me think again. The phasor I is 0.02683 ∠26.565°, so in rectangular form, that's I_r = 0.02683 * cos(26.565°) and I_i = 0.02683 * sin(26.565°).

Calculating I_r: cos(26.565°) ≈ 0.8944, so I_r ≈ 0.02683 * 0.8944 ≈ 0.02395 A, which is 23.95 mA.

I_i: sin(26.565°) ≈ 0.4472, so I_i ≈ 0.02683 * 0.4472 ≈ 0.01204 A, which is 12.04 mA.

Wait, but wait, when you have a phasor I = I_r + j I_i, the time domain is I(t) = I_r cos(ωt) - I_i sin(ωt). Because the j component is the sine term with a negative sign. Or wait, maybe I have the signs mixed up.

Wait, let's clarify. The phasor form is I = I_r + j I_i. When converted to time domain using Euler's formula, it's I(t) = I_r cos(ωt) - I_i sin(ωt). Because the exponential form is e^{jωt} = cos(ωt) + j sin(ωt), so the imaginary part is sin(ωt), but with a negative sign when you move from phasor to time domain.

Wait, maybe I should double-check. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute using the formula I(t) = (V/R) * cos(ωt + φ), where φ is the phase angle.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try another approach. The current I is given by V divided by Z, which is (60 / (2000 - j1000)) A.

Let me compute this division using complex numbers. So I = 60 / (2000 - j1000). To simplify, multiply numerator and denominator by the complex conjugate of the denominator, which is (2000 + j1000).

So I = [60 * (2000 + j1000)] / [(2000 - j1000)(2000 + j1000)].

The denominator becomes (2000)^2 + (1000)^2 = 4,000,000 + 1,000,000 = 5,000,000.

The numerator is 60*(2000 + j1000) = 120,000 + j60,000.

So I = (120,000 + j60,000) / 5,000,000 = (120,000/5e6) + j(60,000/5e6) = 0.024 + j0.012 A.

Converting to mA, that's 24 mA + j12 mA.

Wait, but wait, that can't be right because earlier calculations with magnitude gave me around 26.83 mA. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, let me check the calculation again. 60 * (2000) = 120,000. 60 * 1000 = 60,000. So yes, numerator is 120,000 + j60,000.

Denominator is (2000)^2 + (1000)^2 = 4e6 + 1e6 = 5e6.

So I = (120,000 + j60,000) / 5e6 = (120,000/5e6) = 0.024 A, and (60,000/5e6) = 0.012 A.

So I = 0.024 + j0.012 A, which is 24 mA + j12 mA.

Wait, but earlier when I calculated the magnitude using |V| / |Z|, I got 60 / sqrt(2000² + 1000²) = 60 / sqrt(5e6) ≈ 60 / 2236.07 ≈ 0.02683 A or 26.83 mA. But here, the magnitude of I is sqrt(24^2 + 12^2) = sqrt(576 + 144) = sqrt(720) ≈ 26.83 mA. Oh, okay that matches. So I_r is 24 mA, I_i is 12 mA.

So the current in rectangular form is I = 24 mA + j12 mA.

Now, the time domain expression is I(t) = I_r cos(ωt) - I_i sin(ωt). Because when you express the phasor in terms of cos and sin, the imaginary part gives the sine component with a negative sign.

Wait, wait. Let me think about this again. The phasor I is I_r + j I_i. The time domain expression is I(t) = I_r cos(ωt) + I_i sin(ωt). Or is it with a negative sign for the imaginary part?

Wait, perhaps another way. The phasor form is I = I_r + jI_i = I_m e^{jθ}, where θ is the phase angle. So expanding this, it's I_r + jI_i = I_m cosθ + j I_m sinθ. So in time domain, it's I(t) = I_m cos(ωt + θ), which can be written using trigonometric identities as I_r cos(ωt) - I_i sin(ωt), because cos(a + b) = cos a cos b - sin a sin b. So I_r would be I_m cosθ, and I_i would be I_m sinθ. So when you expand I(t) = I_m cos(ωt + θ), it becomes I_r cos(ωt) - I_i sin(ωt).

Therefore, in this case, I_r is 24 mA and I_i is 12 mA. So I(t) = 24 cos(1000t) - 12 sin(1000t) mA.

Looking at the options, option B is i_forced=24cos1000t -12 sin1000t mA. That matches exactly.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the current's phasor was 26.83 ∠26.565°, which would give I_r = 26.83 * cos(26.565) ≈ 26.83 * 0.8944 ≈ 23.95 mA, and I_i = 26.83 * sin(26.565) ≈ 26.83 * 0.4472 ≈ 12.04 mA. So close to 24 and 12 mA, which is what I got from the complex division method.

So the correct answer should be option B: 24cos1000t -12 sin1000t mA.

To determine the forced current \( i_{\text{forced}} \) in the given R-C circuit, we analyze the series connection of a resistor \( R = 2 \, \text{k}\Omega = 2000 \, \Omega \) and a capacitor \( C = 1 \, \mu\text{F} = 1 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{F} \) under the AC voltage source \( V(t) = 60 \cos(1000t) \, \text{V} \).

### Step 1: Impedance Calculation
The impedance \( Z \) of the series R-C circuit is given by:
\[
Z = R + \frac{1}{j\omega C}
\]
where \( \omega = 1000 \, \text{rad/s} \). Substituting the values:
\[
Z = 2000 - j\frac{1}{1000 \times 1 \times 10^{-6}} = 2000 - j1000 \, \Omega
\]
The magnitude of \( Z \) is:
\[
|Z| = \sqrt{2000^2 + 1000^2} = \sqrt{5,000,000} \approx 2236.07 \, \Omega
\]
The angle \( \theta \) is:
\[
\theta = \arctan\left(\frac{1000}{2000}\right) \approx 26.565^\circ
\]
Thus, \( Z \) in polar form is:
\[
Z \approx 2236.07 \, \angle -26.565^\circ \, \Omega
\]

### Step 2: Current Calculation
The current \( I \) is the voltage divided by the impedance:
\[
I = \frac{V}{Z} = \frac{60}{2236.07 \, \angle -26.565^\circ}
\]
The magnitude of \( I \) is:
\[
|I| = \frac{60}{2236.07} \approx 0.02683 \, \text{A} = 26.83 \, \text{mA}
\]
The angle of \( I \) is:
\[
\phi = 0^\circ - (-26.565^\circ) = 26.565^\circ
\]
Thus, \( I \) in polar form is:
\[
I \approx 26.83 \, \angle 26.565^\circ \, \text{mA}
\]

### Step 3: Rectangular Form Conversion
Converting \( I \) to rectangular form:
\[
I_r = |I| \cos(26.565^\circ) \approx 26.83 \times 0.8944 \approx 24 \, \text{mA}
\]
\[
I_i = |I| \sin(26.565^\circ) \approx 26.83 \times 0.4472 \approx 12 \, \text{mA}
\]
Thus, the current in rectangular form is:
\[
I = 24 \, \text{mA} + j12 \, \text{mA}
\]

### Step 4: Time-Domain Expression
The time-domain expression for the current is:
\[
i(t) = I_r \cos(1000t) - I_i \sin(1000t)
\]
Substituting \( I_r = 24 \, \text{mA} \) and \( I_i = 12 \, \text{mA} \):
\[
i(t) = 24 \cos(1000t) - 12 \sin(1000t) \, \text{mA}
\]

### Final Answer
The correct option is:
**B: \( i_{\text{forced}} = 24 \cos(1000t) - 12 \sin(1000t) \, \text{mA} \)**

B
