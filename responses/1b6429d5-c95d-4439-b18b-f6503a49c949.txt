Okay, so I've got this question about SCR, which stands for Silicon Controlled Rectifier. I'm a bit rusty on my electronics, but I'll try to work through this step by step.

The question says the latching current of an SCR is 20 mA, and we need to find the holding current. The options are A to J, with various milliamp values.

First, I remember that SCR has two main currents: latching current (IL) and holding current (IH). From what I recall, the holding current is the minimum current needed to keep the SCR conducting once it's been triggered. The latching current is the instantaneous current required to actually turn it on.

I think the key point here is the relationship between latching and holding currents. I remember that the holding current is usually less than the latching current. Wait, no, wait—actually, I might have it backwards. Let me think. When an SCR is triggered, it starts conducting. The latching current is the peak current that must be reached to ensure it continues conducting. Once it's conducting, the holding current is the lower current needed to maintain that state. So, the holding current is typically lower than the latching current.

Wait, no, wait again. I'm getting confused. Let me think of it another way. The latching current is the minimum current needed to turn the SCR on and keep it on. Or is it the peak? Hmm. Maybe I should look up the typical relationships.

Oh wait, in my notes, I think it was mentioned that the holding current is usually a fraction of the latching current. For example, sometimes it's around 25% or so. But I'm not sure about the exact ratio.

Alternatively, maybe the holding current is lower than the latching current. So if the latching current is 20 mA, the holding current would be less than that. Looking at the options, the choices less than 20 mA are A:5mA, H:10mA, J:15mA.

But wait, I'm not sure if it's that much lower. I think some sources say that holding current is about 20% to 30% of the latching current. So 20 mA times 0.2 is 4 mA, but that's not an option. 20 mA times 0.25 is 5 mA, which is option A. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe the holding current is higher than the latching current. Wait, that doesn't make sense because once it's latched, you don't need as much current. So the holding current should be lower.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to recall: the latching current is the minimum current needed to turn the device on, and once it's on, the holding current is lower. So, if the latching current is 20 mA, the holding current would be less than that.

Looking at the options, the lower options are A (5), H (10), J (15). But I'm not sure which one is correct. Alternatively, perhaps the holding current is the same as the latching current? That would be option D:20 mA. But I don't think that's right because the holding current is usually lower once it's conducting.

Wait, another thought: maybe the holding current is the same as the latching current. Because once it's triggered, it stays on as long as the current is above the holding level. But I'm not sure if the holding current is the same as the latching.

Alternatively, perhaps the holding current is a different parameter. I think in some textbooks, the relationship between latching current (IL) and holding current (IH) is that IH is less than IL. For example, IH might be around 10% to 20% of IL.

Wait, let's think about an example. Suppose IL is 20 mA. Then IH could be 5 mA (option A), which is 25% of 20. Or it could be 10 mA (option H), which is 50% of 20. Which one is more likely?

I think in many cases, the holding current is about 20% of the latching current. So 20% of 20 mA is 4 mA, but that's not an option. The closest is option A:5mA, which is 25%.

Alternatively, maybe it's 50%—so 10 mA. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think about how SCRs work. The SCR has a gate that, when triggered, causes the device to conduct. Once it's conducting, the current through it (anode current) must be above the holding current to stay on. If the current drops below IH, the SCR turns off.

So, the latching current is the minimum current that must be present when the gate is triggered to ensure the SCR turns on. The holding current is the minimum current needed to keep it on once it's conducting.

So, the holding current is lower than the latching current. So if the latching is 20 mA, the holding is less than 20. So from the options, the possible answers are A, H, J.

But which one? I'm not exactly sure. Maybe the holding current is about 10% to 20% of the latching current. So 20 mA * 0.1 is 2 mA (not an option), 0.2 is 4 mA (no option), 0.25 is 5 mA (option A), 0.5 is 10 mA (option H), etc.

Some sources say that the holding current is typically between 10% to 50% of the latching current. So 20 mA's 10% is 2 mA, 50% is 10 mA. So possible options are A (5mA), H (10mA).

But without exact data, it's hard to choose. However, looking at the options, 5mA is option A, 10mA is H, and 15mA is J.

Wait, maybe in some cases, the holding current is higher. For example, in some devices, it's around 25% to 50% of the latching current. So 20 mA * 0.25 is 5 mA, 0.5 is 10. So 5 mA is possible.

But another angle: sometimes, the holding current is the same as the latching current. Because once it's latched, it's conducting, and the holding current is the same as the latching. But that doesn't make sense because you'd think the device can hold with lower current once it's on.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the answer options. The options are A:5mA, B:23mA, C:25mA, D:20mA, E:30mA, F:40mA, G:50mA, H:10mA, I:60mA, J:15mA.

If the latching current is 20 mA, the holding current is usually lower, so options A, H, J.

But I'm not certain which one is correct. Maybe in the context of the question, the holding current is the same as the latching current. But I don't think that's the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the holding current is higher than the latching. Wait, that can't be right because once it's latched, you don't need as much current to keep it on.

Wait, another approach: in some textbooks, the holding current is the same as the minimum anode current required to maintain the conducting state. It's usually less than the latching current. So if latching is 20 mA, holding is less than 20.

So the options are A, H, J.

But which one? I'm not exactly sure. Maybe the answer is 5 mA (A), but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the holding current is around 10 mA, which is 50% of 20. That's option H.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think of a typical example. Suppose an SCR has a latching current of 20 mA, then the holding current might be around 5 mA (A), which is 25% of 20.

Alternatively, perhaps the holding current is the same as the latching current. Then it would be D:20 mA.

But I think that's not correct because the holding current is lower.

Wait, another thought: the latching current is the instantaneous current needed to trigger the device, while the holding current is the continuous current needed to keep it on. So the holding current is lower.

So, if the latching is 20 mA, the holding would be less than that. So the options are A, H, J.

But without exact data, it's hard. Maybe the answer is 5 mA, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's 10 mA.

Wait, I think I've read that the holding current is typically about 25% of the latching current. So 20 * 0.25 = 5 mA. So option A.

But I'm not 100% certain. Alternatively, perhaps the holding current is 10 mA, which is 50%.

Hmm. I'm a bit torn between A and H. But since 25% is a common ratio, I'll go with A:5 mA.

The latching current (IL) of an SCR is the minimum current required to turn it on and ensure it continues conducting. The holding current (IH) is the minimum current needed to maintain the conducting state once the SCR is triggered. Typically, the holding current is lower than the latching current, often around 20% to 30% of IL. Given IL is 20 mA, IH is expected to be less than 20 mA. Among the options, A (5 mA), H (10 mA), and J (15 mA) are the plausible choices. Considering a common ratio of 25%, IH would be 5 mA (20 mA * 0.25 = 5 mA). Therefore, the most likely answer is:

A.
