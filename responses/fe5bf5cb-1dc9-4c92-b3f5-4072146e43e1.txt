Okay, so I have this probability problem about poker hands. The question is asking for the probability of getting four of a kind when drawing five cards from a standard deck of 52 cards. The options are given from A to J, and I need to choose the correct one.

Let me start by recalling what four of a kind means in poker. It means having four cards of the same rank, like four kings or four queens, and then one card of a different rank. So, in five cards, four are of one value and the fifth is a different value.

To find the probability, I think I need to calculate the number of possible four-of-a-kind hands divided by the total number of possible five-card hands. That makes sense because probability is often favorable outcomes over total outcomes.

First, I'll calculate the total number of possible five-card hands. Since the order doesn't matter in a poker hand, it's a combination problem. The formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number we're choosing.

So, the total number of five-card hands is C(52, 5). Let me compute that. 52 choose 5. I remember that C(52,5) is 2,598,960. Yeah, that sounds right. I've heard that number before in poker probability contexts.

Next, I need to find the number of four-of-a-kind hands. Let's break this down step by step.

Four of a kind consists of four cards of the same rank and one card of a different rank. So, first, I need to choose the rank for the four cards. There are 13 possible ranks (from Ace to King). So, the number of ways to choose the rank is 13.

Once I've chosen the rank for the four cards, I need to choose all four suits for that rank. Since each rank has four suits, there's only one way to choose all four, but actually, since we're taking all four, it's C(4,4) = 1. So, for each rank, there's exactly one way to get all four cards of that rank.

Now, the fifth card has to be of a different rank. So, after choosing the four-of-a-kind rank, I have 12 remaining ranks to choose from. For each of these 12 ranks, I can choose any of the four suits. So, the number of ways to choose the fifth card is 12 (ranks) * 4 (suits) = 48.

So, putting it all together, the number of four-of-a-kind hands is the number of ways to choose the four-of-a-kind rank multiplied by the number of ways to choose the fifth card. That's 13 * 48.

Let me calculate that: 13 * 48 = 624. So, there are 624 four-of-a-kind hands.

Wait, let me double-check. So, ranks: 13, for each, four suits, so that's 13 * 1 (since you take all four). Then, the fifth card is any of the remaining 12 ranks, each with four suits, so 12 * 4 = 48. So total is 13 * 48 = 624. Yeah, that seems correct.

Now, the probability is the number of four-of-a-kind hands divided by the total number of five-card hands. So, that's 624 / 2,598,960.

Let me compute that. First, let's simplify the fraction. Let's see if both numerator and denominator can be divided by 48.

624 divided by 48 is 13. 2,598,960 divided by 48 is... let me calculate: 2,598,960 ÷ 48. 48 goes into 259 (the first three digits) 5*48=240, with 19 left. Bring down 8: 198. 4*48=192, remainder 6. Bring down 9: 69. 1*48=48, remainder 21. Bring down 6: 216. 4*48=192, remainder 24. Bring down 0: 240. 5*48=240, no remainder. So, 2,598,960 ÷48 is 54,145? Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the division. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to simplify step by step.

Wait, 2,598,960 ÷ 624. Let me just compute 624 into 2,598,960.

Wait, no, I should compute 624 / 2,598,960.

Alternatively, perhaps I can divide numerator and denominator by 24.

624 ÷24=26, 2,598,960 ÷24=108,290.

So, now it's 26/108,290. Let's see if we can reduce further. 26 and 108,290. 26 is 2*13, 108,290 is 108,290 ÷2=54,145. So, now it's 13 / 54,145.

Hmm, that might be as simplified as it gets. Alternatively, let me compute the decimal value.

So, 624 ÷ 2,598,960.

Let me compute this division. 624 ÷ 2,598,960.

Well, 624 is approximately 6.24e2, and 2,598,960 is about 2.59896e6.

So, 6.24e2 / 2.59896e6 ≈ (6.24 / 2.59896) * 1e-4.

Calculating 6.24 / 2.59896 ≈ 2.395 approx.

So, 2.395e-4, which is 0.0002395 approximately. So, around 0.00024.

Looking at the options, option F is 0.00024. So, that seems to be the answer.

Wait, but let me confirm my calculation more accurately. Maybe I made a mistake in the division.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute 624 / 2,598,960.

Let me write this as (624 / 2,598,960) = 624 / (2,598,960).

Dividing numerator and denominator by 48, as earlier: 624 ÷48=13, 2,598,960 ÷48=54,145.

So, 13 / 54,145.

Now, let's compute 13 ÷54,145.

54,145 goes into 13 zero times. So, 0.000...

Wait, 54,145 * 0.00024 = approx 54,145 * 24e-5 = 54,145 *24=1,299,480, so 1,299,480e-5 = 12.9948. Wait, that's not matching. Maybe I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps I'll compute 13 ÷54,145.

Let me compute 54,145 * 0.00024.

54,145 * 0.0002 = 10.829.

54,145 * 0.00004 = 2.1658.

So, 0.00024 is 10.829 + 2.1658 = 12.9948.

But 13 is just a bit more than that. So, 0.00024 gives 12.9948, which is just under 13. So, 0.00024 is approximately 13/54,145.

Wait, 54,145 * 0.00024 ≈12.9948, which is very close to 13, so 0.00024 is almost exactly 13/54,145.

Thus, the probability is approximately 0.00024, which is option F.

The probability of four of a kind in a five-card poker hand is calculated by determining the number of favorable hands divided by the total number of possible hands. There are 624 four-of-a-kind hands, and the total number of five-card hands is 2,598,960. Dividing these gives a probability of approximately 0.00024.
