Okay, so I've got this chemistry question here about Brønsted-Lowry acid-base pairs. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it step by step.

First, I remember that the Brønsted-Lowry theory defines an acid as a proton (H+) donor and a base as a proton acceptor. That means an acid-base pair should consist of two species where one is the acid and the other is its conjugate base. The conjugate base is what's left after the acid donates a proton. So, the acid loses a proton to become the conjugate base.

Looking at the options, I need to identify which pair fits this description. Let's go through each one.

Option A: HC2H3O2 and C2H3O2-
HC2H3O2 is acetic acid, right? If it donates a proton, it becomes C2H3O2-, which is the acetate ion. So that makes sense as a conjugate acid-base pair. Acetic acid is the acid, and acetate is its conjugate base.

Option B: SO3^2- and SO2^2-
Wait, SO3^2- is sulfite ion. If it donates a proton, it becomes SO2^2- (sulfide? Or maybe I'm mixing up the names). Wait, no, sulfite is SO3^2-, and if it loses a proton (H+), it would become SO2^2- (which I think is actually S^2- or maybe another form, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's the other way around—maybe SO3^2- is the base and SO2^2- is the conjugate acid. Hmm, but I'm not certain if this is a typical pair. I'll come back to this.

Option C: H3PO4 and H3PO3
H3PO4 is phosphoric acid. If it donates a proton, it becomes H2PO4^-, right? But the option here is H3PO3, which is a different compound. Oh wait, H3PO3 is phosphorous acid, which is a different species. So I don't think these are conjugates because they're different acids. H3PO4 losing a proton would give H2PO4^-, not H3PO3. So this pair doesn't fit the Brønsted-Lowry definition.

Option D: H3O+ and OH-
Hmm, H3O+ is the hydronium ion. If it donates a proton, it becomes H2O. But the option says OH- (hydroxide). Wait, no, H3O+ losing a proton would become H2O, not OH-. So this pair isn't correct. Unless I'm misunderstanding. Oh wait, maybe in another reaction? Let me think. Alternatively, OH- is a base because it can accept a proton to become H2O. But in this case, H3O+ is the acid, and its conjugate base would be H2O, not OH-. So this pair isn't right either.

So, reviewing the options:

A is correct because HC2H3O2 donates a proton to become C2H3O2^-.

B: I'm not sure. Let me think again. SO3^2- as a base would accept a proton to become HSO3^- or something else. Wait, no—wait, in the Brønsted-Lowry context, the acid is the proton donor, so if SO3^2- is acting as an acid, it would donate a proton to become SO2^2-. Wait, but is that a thing? Or is SO3^2- a base? Because sulfite is a weak base. So if it's a base, its conjugate acid would be HSO3^- or something else. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here.

Wait, perhaps I should think about each pair as acid and conjugate base. For option B, if SO3^2- is the base, then the conjugate acid would be HSO3^- (because SO3^2- + H+ → HSO3^-). But the option pairs it with SO2^2-, which is not HSO3^-, so that doesn't fit. Alternatively, if SO2^2- is the base, then the acid would be HSO2^2- or something else. I'm getting a bit stuck here, but I think option A is definitely correct. The others, like D, don't fit because the conjugate base isn't correct.

So the correct answer should be A.

The Brønsted-Lowry theory defines an acid as a proton donor and a base as a proton acceptor, with the conjugate base being the species formed after the acid donates a proton. 

- **Option A**: HC2H3O2 (acetic acid) donates a proton to become C2H3O2^- (acetate ion), forming a valid conjugate acid-base pair.  
- **Option B**: SO3^2- (sulfite ion) is a base, and its conjugate acid would be HSO3^- (bisulfite ion), not SO2^2-. Thus, this pair does not fit the Brønsted-Lowry definition.  
- **Option C**: H3PO4 (phosphoric acid) donates a proton to become H2PO4^-, not H3PO3 (phosphorous acid). These are not conjugates.  
- **Option D**: H3O+ (hydronium ion) donates a proton to become H2O, not OH^- (hydroxide ion). This pair is incorrect.  

The correct answer is **A**, as it satisfies the Brønsted-Lowry conjugate acid-base relationship.  

Answer: A
