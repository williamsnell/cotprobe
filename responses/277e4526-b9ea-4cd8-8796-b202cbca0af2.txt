Question:

A home security protection company provided protection services to property owners in the immediate area. The owner of a summer cottage in the area hired the company to provide 24- hour protection during the winter months when his home was unoccupied. According to the security arrangement, the company's uniformed guards would periodically patrol the property and, if necessary, provide an "armed response" to any unauthorized individuals who were found trespassing on the property. The company provided security protection to the owner's property for two years. The owner then notified the company that he was planning to sell the cottage. As a result, he requested that the company discontinue its home-protection service, effective immediately. Two weeks later, a burglar broke into the cottage and was ransacking it. As the burglar was exiting from the owner's house carrying a portable television set, he was seen by a security guard working for the company. The security guard, who was driving past the home on security patrol, had not been informed that the owner had discontinued protection services. The security guard suddenly stopped his patrol vehicle and ran toward the burglar shouting, "Stop! Don't move or I'll shoot!" Startled, the burglar dropped the television set and began to flee. Believing that the suspected burglar was about to escape, the security guard pulled out his service revolver and fired a bullet at the burglar. The shot struck the burglar in the leg, seriously wounding him. If the burglar asserts a claim against the owner for negligently failing to supervise those providing security services for the owner's property, the burglar will probably

Options:

A: not prevail, because the security guard was acting in the course of his duties.
B: prevail, because the burglar was unarmed when he was shot.
C: prevail, because the security guard acted without proper authorization.
D: prevail, because the security guard used excessive force.
E: not prevail, because the owner was not present when the shooting occurred.
F: not prevail, because the owner had discontinued protection services from the company when the shooting occurred.
G: prevail, because the owner knew or had reason to know that the company provided an "armed response" to suspected trespassers.
H: not prevail, because the owner had no control over the actions of the security guard.
I: prevail, because the owner did not properly inform the company of the discontinued services.
J: not prevail, because the burglar was trespassing on private property.

Okay, so I have this question about tort law, specifically negligence. Let's break it down step by step. 

The scenario is about a home security company that provided 24-hour protection to a property owner. The owner hired them for his summer cottage during winter when he was unoccupied. The contract included uniformed guards patrolling and an "armed response" if needed. They provided service for two years, and then the owner decided to sell the cottage, so he told the company to stop the protection immediately. 

Two weeks later, a burglar broke in and was caught by a security guard. The guard stopped his patrol, ran towards the burglar, shouted, and when the burglar tried to flee, the guard shot him, injuring him. Now, the burglar is suing the owner for negligence in supervising the security services.

I need to figure out whether the burglar will prevail in his claim. The options are A through J, each giving a different reason.

First, I should recall the elements of negligence: duty, breach, causation, and damages. For the owner to be liable, he must have owed the burglar a duty of care, breached it, which caused the injury, and resulted in damages.

But wait, the situation is the owner hired a security company, and the guard is an employee of that company. So, the question revolves around whether the owner can be held liable for the guard's actions. 

In tort law, the general rule is that an employer can be liable for the actions of their employees under the doctrine of respondeat superior, which holds the employer responsible if the employee was acting within the scope of their employment. But here, the owner has already told the company to stop services, effective immediately. So when the guard was on patrol that day, was he still acting within the scope of his duties?

The key fact is that the owner notified the company to discontinue services, but the guard didn't know about this. So from the guard's perspective, he was still doing his job. But from the company's side, they might have stopped sending guards or the guards might have been told to stop patrolling that property. But in this case, the guard was still patrolling, so the issue is whether the company still considered him to be on duty when the incident happened.

If the company had officially stopped providing services, then the guard's actions might not be within the scope of his employment anymore. If that's the case, the owner wouldn't be liable because the duty was no longer in place. But if the company didn't properly inform the guard, and he was still acting as if he was employed, then the employer (the security company) might be liable, but the owner may not be.

Wait, but the question is whether the owner can be held liable. The owner hired the company, and the company's guard was acting in his capacity. If the owner told the company to stop, but the company didn't inform the guard, does that mean the owner was still responsible?

Alternatively, if the owner discontinued the services, he might not have a duty anymore. So the duty was breached only if he failed to properly supervise, but if he tried to stop the service, maybe he can't be negligent in that aspect.

Looking at the options, option F says the owner had discontinued services, so he's not liable. That seems plausible because if the services were stopped, the owner isn't responsible for the guard's actions anymore.

Option H says the owner had no control over the guard's actions. That's true, but if the owner had a duty, even if he had no control, he could be liable if he breached that duty. But if he had no duty because he stopped the service, then H would support that.

Option I says the owner didn't properly inform the company, so he's liable. But if the company didn't pass the message to the guard, that might be the company's fault, not the owner's. The owner did notify the company, so he fulfilled his part. The company's failure to communicate with their own employee might be their problem, not the owner's.

Option G suggests the owner knew the company provided armed response. But that's about foreseeability, maybe. If the owner knew the guards were armed, could that mean he was negligent in allowing that? But if he had stopped the service, maybe he can't be liable for actions after that.

So putting it together, the owner tried to stop the service, so the duty of care was terminated. Therefore, he didn't breach any duty, so the burglar can't prevail. That would make option F correct: the owner had discontinued services, so he's not liable.

The owner notified the security company to discontinue services, so the duty of care was terminated. The guard acted without the owner's knowledge, and the owner had no control over the situation after discontinuing services. Therefore, the owner is not liable.

Answer: F
