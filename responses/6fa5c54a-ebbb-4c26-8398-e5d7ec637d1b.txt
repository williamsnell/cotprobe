Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about personnel selection, specifically about the definition of the selection ratio. Hmm, I remember selection ratios being discussed in my HR management class. Let me think through this.

The question is asking what the selection ratio is defined as. The options are A to D. I need to figure out which one is correct.

Selection ratio, as I recall, has to do with how many people are hired compared to those who applied. So it's about the number of successful candidates versus the number of applicants. Wait, but I should make sure.

Option A says the ratio of successful to unsuccessful workers. That sounds more like a success rate among those hired, but I think selection ratio is about the hiring process itself, not the performance of the hired workers. So maybe A isn't right.

Option B is the ratio of successful selected workers to the job's difficulty level. Hmm, difficulty level? I don't remember selection ratio involving job difficulty. It's more about the number of people selected versus applicants. So B might not be correct.

Option C is the percent of workers correctly placed. That sounds like placement effectiveness or job fit, which is a different concept. Selection ratio isn't about how well they fit; it's about how many are chosen relative to applicants. So C is probably not the answer.

Option D is the ratio of workers needed to applicants available. Oh, wait, that sounds familiar. I think selection ratio is the number of people hired divided by the number of applicants. Or is it the other way around? Wait, no. Selection ratio is the number of successful candidates divided by the number of applicants. So if 100 people applied and 10 were hired, the ratio is 10:100, or 1:10. So D says the ratio of workers needed to applicants available, which would be the same as successful over applicants. So D seems correct.

Wait, but I should double-check. The selection ratio is sometimes expressed as the number of hires divided by the number of applicants. So yes, that's the same as D. So the answer should be D.

The selection ratio is defined as the ratio of the number of workers needed to the number of applicants available. This measures how many candidates are successfully selected relative to the total number of applicants.
