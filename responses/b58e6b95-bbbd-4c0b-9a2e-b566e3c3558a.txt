Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how many bytes will be written to memory during the execution of the loop. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.

First, the setup: We've got two arrays, A and B. Array A has 256 elements, each 4 bytes, so that's 256 *4 = 1024 bytes. Array B has 512 elements, each 4 bytes, so 512*4=2048 bytes. 

The cache is a direct-mapped, physically tagged, 2K-byte cache with an 8-byte block size. So each block holds 8 bytes. Let's see, 2K is 2048 bytes, so the cache has 2048 / 8 = 256 blocks.

The cache uses a write-back policy, which means that when a write happens, the data is written to the cache first, and only when the block is replaced does it get written back to memory.

The loop is for (i=0; i<256; i++) A[i] = A[i] + B[2*i]; 

So each iteration, we're reading A[i], reading B[2*i], adding them, and storing back into A[i]. 

Let me think about the addresses. 

Array A's first element is at 4096. Since each element is 4 bytes, the addresses for A are from 4096 to 4096 + 255*4 = 4096 + 1020 = 5116. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, 256 elements, each 4 bytes: 256*4=1024 bytes. So starting at 4096, the last element ends at 4096 + 1023 = 5119. So address 4096 is A[0], 4097-4099 is A[0], wait no, each element is 4 bytes, so each takes 4 consecutive bytes. So A[0] is at 4096, 4097, 4098, 4099. A[1] starts at 4100, and so on.

Similarly, B starts at 8192. Each element is 4 bytes, 512 elements: 512*4=2048 bytes. So B ends at 8192 + 2047 = 10239, I think.

Now, the cache has 8-byte blocks. So each block is 8 bytes. Let me see how the cache works. Since it's direct-mapped, each physical address maps to exactly one cache block. The block number is determined by dividing the address by the block size. So for a block size of 8 bytes, the block number is (address) / 8.

Wait, no, wait. The block size is 8 bytes, so each block holds 8 bytes. So the block number is calculated by taking the physical address, dividing by the block size (8 bytes), and taking the integer part. So for example, address 4096 is in block 4096/8 = 512. Address 4097 is also in block 512, and so on up to 4103 (since 4103/8=512.875, so integer division gives 512). Then 4104 is block 513.

Wait, but the cache is 256 blocks (since 2048 bytes / 8 bytes per block = 256 blocks). So the block numbers go from 0 to 255. So any address beyond 255*8=2048 would map to block 255? Wait no, because 2048 /8 is 256, but the cache has 256 blocks, numbered 0-255. Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating. Let me think again.

The physical addresses are mapped to the cache using modulo 256, because the number of blocks is 256. So the block number is (address / block_size) mod number_of_blocks. So for block size 8, the block number is (address /8) mod 256.

Wait, but the cache has 256 blocks, each 8 bytes, so the block index is (address in bytes) /8 mod 256. Because 256 blocks *8 bytes = 2048 bytes, which is the cache size.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute the block index as (address) >> 3 (since 8 is 2^3), then mod 256 (since there are 256 blocks). So for example, address 4096 is 4096 >>3 = 512, mod 256 is 0. So block 0. Address 4097 is also 512 mod 256 is 0. Address 4103 is same. Address 4104 is 513 mod 256= 513-2*256=1. So block 1.

Similarly, let's calculate where the addresses of A and B fall in the cache.

Array A starts at 4096, which is block (4096/8) = 512. 512 mod 256 is 0. So all elements of A are in block 0. Because each element is 4 bytes, so each A[i] is in block 0. Because starting at 4096, each next element is 4 bytes higher, which is 0.5 blocks (since 8 bytes per block), but the block index is (address/8) mod 256. So for A[i], the address is 4096 + i*4. So (4096 +4i)/8 = 512 + 0.5i. The block is (512 + 0.5i) mod 256. 512 mod 256 is 0, so block is (0.5i) mod 256. Wait, but 0.5i is not an integer. Hmm, perhaps I should think in terms of the block index being (address >>3) mod 256.

Wait, for address 4096: 4096 in binary is 1000000000000, which is 13 bits. Shifting right by 3 gives 1000000000000 >>3 = 10000000000, which is 8192? No, wait, no, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me think again.

Wait, 4096 is 2^12. So 4096 divided by 8 is 512. So block index is 512 mod 256 = 0. So A starts at block 0.

Then, each element of A is 4 bytes, so the next element is at address 4096+4=4100. 4100/8=512.5, so the block index is 512.5 mod 256? Wait, but block indices must be integers. Oh right, because the address is aligned to the block. Wait, no, waitâ€”each element is 4 bytes, which is half a block. So each element is in the same block as the previous? No, wait, 4 bytes is half of 8. So, for example:

A[0] is at 4096-4099: block 0.

A[1] is at 4100-4103: which is (4100)/8=512.5, but since the block index is based on the starting address, perhaps the next block is 513 mod 256=1. So each A[i] is in block i*4/8 mod 256. Wait, perhaps I'm complicating this.

Wait, maybe a better approach is to see how many times each block is accessed and whether they hit in the cache or miss, leading to writes.

But perhaps it's easier to think about the addresses of A and B.

Array A is at 4096, 4 bytes each, 256 elements: so addresses 4096 to 4096 + 4*255 = 4096 + 1020 = 5116. So the last address is 5116 +3=5119.

Each address in A is at 4096 +4i, for i from 0 to 255.

Similarly, Array B starts at 8192, 4 bytes each, 512 elements: 8192 to 8192 +4*511=8192+2044=10236. So the last address is 10236+3=10239.

Now, in the loop, for each i from 0 to 255:

We access A[i] (read), then B[2i] (read), compute the sum, and write back to A[i].

Wait, no: the loop is A[i] = A[i] + B[2i]. So for each i, we read A[i], read B[2i], compute the sum, and write the result back to A[i].

So each iteration involves two reads and one write.

But the cache is write-back, which means that when we write to a location, if the block isn't in the cache, it's loaded into the cache, but the write is done to the cache, not to memory. Only when the block is replaced does the data get written back.

Wait, but in a write-back policy, when you write to a location, the data is written into the cache, and the cache block is marked as dirty. When a cache miss occurs (either for a read or a write), the block is loaded, and any previous data is written back to memory before the new data is loaded. Or wait, maybe not. Let me think again.

In write-back (or write-through?) Wait, no: write-back is where writes are done to the cache first, and the data is not written to memory until the block is replaced. So when a write occurs, if the data is already in the cache, it's updated in the cache, marked as dirty. If the data is not in the cache, the block is loaded into the cache (causing a read from memory), and then the write is done to the cache. So the initial load (read) would write the data from memory to the cache, but the write operation only updates the cache, and the old data remains in the cache until it's evicted.

Wait, but in this scenario, when the loop runs, the first access to A[i] and B[2i] will cause cache misses, so the data is loaded into the cache, and written into the cache, not into memory yet. Subsequent accesses may hit in the cache.

But let's get back to the block indices.

Each access is to a specific byte address. Let me compute the block index for each access.

First, for array A:

Each A[i] is at 4096 +4i bytes.

The block index is (address) /8 mod 256. So (4096 +4i)/8 = 512 + 0.5i. So the block index is (512 + 0.5i) mod 256.

But 512 mod 256 is 0, so block index is (0 + 0.5i) mod 256.

But 0.5i is not an integer. Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here because the address is in bytes, and each block is 8 bytes, so the block index is (address) >> 3 (since 8 is 2^3), then mod 256.

So for address 4096, 4096 >>3 is 512, mod 256 is 0.

Address 4096 +4 =4100: 4100 >>3 is 4100 /8=512.5, so 512 as integer division, mod 256 is 0.

Wait, but 4100 is 4096 +4, which is 4096 is block 0, and 4096 +4 is still in block 0 since 4 bytes is less than 8 bytes. So A[i]'s address is 4096 +4i.

So the block index for A[i] is (4096 +4i) >>3 mod 256.

Which is (512 + 0.5i) mod 256.

But since 0.5i can be a fractional part, but the block index must be an integer. Hmm, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think differently.

Each block holds 8 bytes, so the first 8 bytes in A are at 4096-4103, which is block 0. Then the next 8 bytes are 4104-4111, which is block 1, and so on.

Wait, no, because 4096 is the start of A, and each element is 4 bytes, so the blocks for A are block 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, etc. Because each element is 4 bytes, which is half a block. So for i from 0 to 255, A[i] is at 4096 +4i. So the block index is (4096 +4i) >>3.

Which is 4096 >>3 is 512, so 512 + (4i)/8 = 512 + 0.5i.

So the block index is (512 + 0.5i) mod 256.

Since 512 mod 256 is 0, the block index is (0 + 0.5i) mod 256.

But 0.5i is not an integer, so perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Because addresses are in bytes, and each block is 8 bytes, the block index must be an integer. So perhaps the correct way is to compute (address) / 8, which gives the block index as an integer, and then mod 256.

Wait, for example, address 4096: 4096/8=512 â†’ block 512 mod 256=0.

Address 4096+4=4100: 4100/8=512.5 â†’ floor is 512, so 512 mod 256=0.

Similarly, 4096+4*2=4108: 4108/8=513.5 â†’ floor 513 â†’ 513 mod256=1.

Wait, but 4096 is 512*8, so the next block is 513, which is 1 mod 256.

Wait, perhaps the block index for A[i] is (512 + (i//2)) mod 256.

Because each two elements of A (each 4 bytes) take up 8 bytes, so every two elements, the block index increases by 1.

Wait, let me check: i=0 â†’ A[0] is 4096-4099 â†’ block 0.

i=1 â†’ A[1] is 4100-4103 â†’ block 1.

i=2 â†’ A[2] is 4104-4107 â†’ block 2.

So for i, the block index is (512 + (i//2)) mod 256.

Wait, no. Because for i=0, i//2=0 â†’ block 512+0=512 mod256=0.

i=1 â†’ 1//2=0 â†’ block 0.

i=2 â†’ 2//2=1 â†’ block 513 mod256=1.

i=3 â†’3//2=1 â†’ block 1.

Yes, that makes sense. So the block index for A[i] is (512 + (i//2)) mod 256.

Similarly, for B, each element is 4 bytes. B starts at 8192.

Each B[j] is at 8192 +4j.

So the block index is (8192 +4j)/8 = 1024 + 0.5j.

So block index is (1024 + 0.5j) mod 256.

1024 mod256 is 0, because 256*4=1024.

So block index is (0 +0.5j) mod256.

Again, since j is an integer, 0.5j may not be an integer. Hmm, perhaps a better approach is to see that for B[j], the block index is (1024 + (j//2)) mod256.

Because each two elements of B (8 bytes) make a block. So for j=0, block 0; j=1, same block; j=2, block 1; etc.

Wait, no: 8192 is the start of B. Let's see:

B[0] is at 8192-8195 â†’ block 8192/8=1024 â†’ 1024 mod256=0.

B[1] is at 8196-8199 â†’ same block 0.

B[2] is at 8200-8203 â†’ block (8200)/8=1025 â†’ mod256=1.

So for B[j], the block index is (1024 + (j//2)) mod256.

So for j even, j=2k, block index is 1024 +k mod256= k mod256.

So in the loop, each i runs from 0 to 255.

In each iteration, we access A[i] and B[2i].

So for each i:

A[i] is in block (512 + (i//2)) mod256.

B[2i] is at 8192 +4*(2i)=8192+8i.

So the block index for B[2i] is (8192 +8i)/8 = 1024 +i â†’ mod256= i mod256.

So for B[2i], the block index is i mod256.

Now, the cache is initially empty. So the first access to A[0] will be a cache miss, so the block is loaded into the cache. Then, the first access to B[0] (since 2i=0 when i=0) will be a cache miss, so loaded into the cache.

But wait, the cache is direct-mapped, so each block can only be in one place. So when we access A[i], it's mapped to a specific block, and when we access B[j], it's mapped to another block.

So for each A[i], the block is (512 + (i//2)) mod256. For i from 0 to 255, (i//2) can be 0 to 127, since 256/2=128.

Wait, 256 elements for A, each two elements fit into one block. So (i//2) goes up to 127 (since 256/2=128, so i//2 for i=255 is 127).

So the block index for A[i] is (512 + (i//2)) mod256. 512 mod256 is 0, so it's (i//2) mod256.

But since i//2 for A's 256 elements can be up to 127, the block indices for A will be 0 to 127.

Similarly, for B[2i], the block index is i mod256. Since i runs up to 255, the block indices for B will be 0 to 255.

Wait, but the cache has 256 blocks. So the blocks for A are 0 to 127, and for B, 0 to 255. So some blocks are shared between A and B.

But let's proceed.

Now, the loop runs 256 times. Each iteration, we read A[i], read B[2i], compute the sum, and write back to A[i].

Each write to A[i] will affect the cache. Let's think about each step.

First iteration (i=0):

- Read A[0]: block (0//2)=0 mod256=0. Cache is empty, so miss. Load A[0] into block 0. Now, block 0 is in the cache, holds A[0] (4 bytes), and the rest of the block is perhaps 4 bytes of zeros or whatever. But we'll see.

Then, Read B[0]: block 0 (since i=0, j=0, block=0). So we access block 0 again. But since the cache is direct-mapped, and block 0 is already in the cache from the A[0] read, this will be a hit. So we read B[0] from the cache.

Then, compute A[0] = A[0] + B[0], and write back to A[0]. Since the write is to A[0], which is in block 0, which is already in the cache. So we write the new value into the cache, marking the block as dirty.

So the first iteration: A[0] is read (miss), B[0] is read (hit), and A[0] is written (hit, since block 0 is in cache).

No data is written to memory yet, except when the cache is evicted, which hasn't happened yet.

Second iteration (i=1):

- Read A[1]: block (1//2)=0 mod256=0. Block 0 is in cache, so hit. Read A[1] from cache.

- Read B[2*1=2]: block index for B[2] is j=2 â†’ block 2 mod256=2. So block 2 is not in cache yet. So miss. Load block 2 into cache. Now, block 2 holds B[2] and B[3], since each block is 8 bytes.

- Compute A[1] = A[1] + B[2]. Write back to A[1], which is in block 0, which is in cache. So write to cache, mark as dirty.

So after iteration 1, block 2 is loaded.

Now, let's see how many writes have occurred. So far, only the initial reads. No writes to memory yet, except when a block is evicted.

Wait, but when a block is loaded into the cache, if it's a miss, the data is loaded from memory into the cache. For write-back, the data is written to the cache, not to memory. So no writes to memory happen during a read miss.

Now, for the write back, the data is written to the cache, and when the block is evicted, it's written back to memory.

So the writes to memory will occur when a block is evicted from the cache and written back.

So the question is, how many blocks are evicted during the loop, and how much data is written back.

But this could get complicated. Alternatively, perhaps we can calculate how many times each block is written to, and whether it's evicted.

But perhaps a better approach is to compute how many times each block is accessed, and whether it's evicted.

Wait, but with 256 iterations, each accessing two blocks (A and B), and the cache is 256 blocks, perhaps each block is accessed once, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps each block is accessed multiple times, and some may be evicted.

Wait, but let's think about the number of cache lines accessed.

Each A[i] is in block (i//2), and each B[2i] is in block i.

So for i from 0 to 255:

- A accesses blocks 0, 0, 1,1, 2,2, ..., 127,127.

Because (i//2) for i=0 is 0, i=1 is 0, i=2 is 1, etc.

So for A, each block 0 to 127 is accessed twice each (since there are 256 elements, each block is accessed twice, except perhaps the last one if 256 is even, which it is).

Wait, 256 /2=128, so blocks 0 to 127 are each accessed twice.

For B, each B[2i] is in block i, and i runs from 0 to 255, so blocks 0 to 255 are accessed once each.

So total accesses:

A accesses: 256 accesses, each to 128 blocks (0-127), each block accessed twice.

B accesses: 256 accesses, each to 256 blocks (0-255), each block accessed once.

Now, the cache is initially empty. So the first access to any block will cause a cache miss, loading the block into the cache. But since the cache has 256 blocks, each block can hold one block of 8 bytes.

Wait, no, the cache can hold 256 blocks, each 8 bytes. So each block in memory can be loaded into the cache once, and when a new block is needed, the old one is evicted.

Wait, but when a block is loaded, it replaces whatever was in that cache block. So when a new block is accessed, if the cache has space, it's loaded; if not, an eviction occurs.

Wait, but the cache is 256 blocks, so initially empty. So the first 256 block accesses will each fill a new block in the cache without any evictions. After that, each new block access will cause an eviction.

Wait, but in our scenario, the number of block accesses is 256 (for A) + 256 (for B) = 512 block accesses.

But the cache can hold 256 blocks, so the first 256 block accesses will fill the cache. The next 256 will each cause an eviction, writing back the previous block's data to memory.

Wait, but in reality, some blocks may be accessed multiple times, so the same block may be loaded multiple times without eviction.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model this as a stream of block accesses and see which ones cause cache misses (and thus require writes to memory).

Let me consider the order of accesses.

Each iteration i, we have:

1. Read A[i], which is in block (i//2).

2. Read B[2i], which is in block i.

3. Write to A[i], which is in block (i//2).

So for each i, the blocks accessed are:

- Read A[i]: block (i//2)

- Read B[2i]: block i

- Write A[i]: block (i//2)

So for each i, two read accesses (A's block and B's block) and one write access (A's block).

Now, let's think about the order of block accesses for i from 0 to 255.

i=0:

Read A[0] â†’ block 0.

Read B[0] â†’ block 0.

Write A[0] â†’ block 0.

i=1:

Read A[1] â†’ block 0.

Read B[2] â†’ block 2.

Write A[1] â†’ block 0.

i=2:

Read A[2] â†’ block 1.

Read B[4] â†’ block 4.

Write A[2] â†’ block 1.

i=3:

Read A[3] â†’ block 1.

Read B[6] â†’ block 6.

Write A[3] â†’ block 1.

And so on.

So the sequence of block accesses for reads and writes is:

For i=0:

read block 0, read block 0, write block 0.

i=1:

read block 0, read block 2, write block 0.

i=2:

read block 1, read block4, write block1.

i=3:

read block1, read block6, write block1.

...

So, the first read for i=0 is block0: miss, loaded into cache.

Then read block0 again for B[0]: hit.

Write to block0: cache is already holding it, so write to cache, mark as dirty.

For i=1:

Read block0: hit.

Read block2: miss, load into cache.

Write to block0: hit.

i=2:

Read block1: miss, load into cache.

Read block4: miss, load into cache.

Write to block1: hit.

i=3:

Read block1: hit.

Read block6: miss, load into cache.

Write to block1: hit.

And so on.

Wait, but the cache can hold 256 blocks, so for the first 256 block accesses, it's filled without any eviction. But in our case, the first 256 block accesses would be:

i=0:

block0 (read), block0 (read), block0 (write).

i=1:

block0 (read), block2 (read), block0 (write).

i=2:

block1 (read), block4 (read), block1 (write).

i=3:

block1 (read), block6 (read), block1 (write).

...

Each time a new block is accessed, it's a miss, loaded into the cache, until all 256 blocks are filled.

Once the cache is full, any new block access will cause an eviction.

So, up to i=255, how many blocks are accessed?

Each i requires two read blocks and one write block, but some may hit.

But let's think about the total number of block accesses.

Each i:

- Read A[i]: block (i//2) â†’ 256 accesses.

- Read B[2i]: block i â†’ 256 accesses.

- Write A[i]: block (i//2) â†’ 256 accesses.

Total block accesses: 768.

But the cache has 256 blocks, so the first 256 block accesses (reads and writes) will fill the cache without eviction. The next 512 block accesses (768-256=512) will each cause an eviction, writing back the previous block's data to memory.

Wait, but write-back only writes when the block is evicted. So each time a block is evicted, the dirty data is written back to memory.

So the number of evictions is equal to the number of times a new block is accessed beyond the cache's capacity.

In this case, the cache can hold 256 blocks. The first 256 block accesses (reads and writes) will load the cache without eviction. The next 512 block accesses will require eviction.

But let's calculate how many times each block is accessed.

For the A accesses: each block (0-127) is accessed twice.

For the B accesses: each block (0-255) is accessed once.

So total accesses:

For A: 256 accesses (twice each for 128 blocks).

For B: 256 accesses (once each for 256 blocks).

So total block accesses: 512.

But the cache can hold 256 blocks, so the first 256 block accesses (the first 256 of the 512) will be misses, each loaded into the cache. The next 256 block accesses will be misses again, causing evictions.

Wait, no: because the first 256 block accesses are from A and B.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model each block access as either a hit or a miss.

Block accesses for A: for each of the 256 A accesses, the block is (i//2). So for i from 0 to 255, A accesses blocks 0,0,1,1,...,127,127.

So each of these blocks 0-127 is accessed twice.

Block accesses for B: for each i, B accesses block i. So for i=0 to 255, B accesses blocks 0,1,2,...,255.

Each of these blocks is accessed once.

So total block accesses (read and write):

A: 256 (each block 0-127 twice â†’ 256 accesses).

B: 256 (each block 0-255 once â†’ 256 accesses).

Write accesses (for A): 256 (each block 0-127 twice â†’ 256 accesses).

So total block accesses: 256 (A reads) +256 (B reads) +256 (A writes) = 768.

Now, the cache starts empty. The first 256 block accesses (any type) will be misses, each loaded into the cache. After that, each new block access will cause an eviction.

So the first 256 block accesses: all are misses, loaded into cache. No writes to memory yet.

Block accesses 257 to 768: each is a miss, causing an eviction. Each eviction writes the dirty data from the evicted block to memory.

So the number of evictions is 768 - 256 = 512.

Each eviction writes 8 bytes to memory, because each block is 8 bytes.

So total bytes written to memory: 512 evictions *8 bytes = 4096 bytes.

But wait, that can't be right because the options don't have 4096 as a correct answer for this question. Wait, option C is 4096. But I thought the correct answer is 2048. Hmm.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in counting the number of evictions.

Wait, let's think again.

The total number of block accesses is 768.

The cache can hold 256 blocks, so the first 256 block accesses are misses. The next 512 accesses are misses as well, each causing an eviction.

Each eviction writes 8 bytes to memory.

So total bytes written: 512 *8=4096.

But wait, the options include 4096 as option C. But I'm not sure if this is correct because the write-back policy only writes when the block is evicted, not every write.

But let's think: each write to a block is marked as dirty. Only when the block is evicted is the data written back.

So for each eviction, 8 bytes are written.

So total evictions: 768 - 256 = 512.

512 *8=4096 bytes.

But wait, in the options, option C is 4096. But let's check the options again.

Options:

A:512

B:1028

C:4096

D:1024

E:2000

F:5000

G:2048

H:1500

I:256

J:0

But I'm confused because I thought the answer would be 2048, but according to this calculation, it's 4096.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that each i requires two read accesses and one write access, but the write accesses are to the same block as the first read access, so perhaps the write accesses don't count as new block accesses.

Wait, no, because the block is already in the cache when the write occurs. So the write doesn't cause a block access; it's just a hit.

So the write accesses don't cause cache misses, so they don't contribute to the eviction count.

So the total number of block accesses that cause misses are the read accesses only.

So for the reads:

A accesses: 256 read accesses.

B accesses: 256 read accesses.

So total read accesses: 512.

The writes are 256, but they are hits, so no misses.

So the first 256 read accesses will be misses, filling the cache. The next 256 read accesses will be misses, causing 256 evictions.

Each eviction writes 8 bytes, so 256 *8=2048 bytes.

That makes more sense. So the total bytes written to memory would be 2048.

So the correct answer is G:2048.

Wait, but let me double-check.

Each read access (A and B) contributes to block accesses. Writes are hits, so no new block is accessed.

So total read accesses: 512.

Cache can hold 256 blocks, so first 256 read accesses are misses, next 256 are misses.

Each eviction writes 8 bytes.

So 256 evictions *8=2048 bytes.

Yes, that makes sense.

The problem involves two arrays, A and B, accessed in a loop with a direct-mapped, write-back cache. Array A has 256 elements (1024 bytes) starting at address 4096, and Array B has 512 elements (2048 bytes) starting at address 8192. The cache is 2K bytes with 8-byte blocks, totaling 256 blocks.

Each iteration of the loop accesses A[i] and B[2i], then writes back to A[i]. The cache initially empty, and the goal is to determine how many bytes are written to memory during the loop.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Cache Behavior**:
   - The cache is direct-mapped, so each physical address maps to a specific cache block.
   - The block index is `(address / 8) % 256`.
   - Write-back policy means data is written to the cache first, and only written to memory when evicted.

2. **Array Accesses**:
   - **A[i]**: Each element is 4 bytes, so A[i] accesses block `(i // 2) % 256`.
   - **B[2i]**: Each element is 4 bytes, so B[2i] accesses block `i % 256`.

3. **Total Block Accesses**:
   - **Reads**: 512 block accesses (256 from A and 256 from B).
   - **Writes**: 256 block accesses (to A[i]).

4. **Cache Evictions**:
   - The cache can hold 256 blocks. The first 256 block accesses (reads) are misses, filling the cache.
   - The next 256 block accesses (reads) are also misses, causing 256 evictions. Each eviction writes 8 bytes to memory.

5. **Bytes Written to Memory**:
   - Each eviction writes 8 bytes, so `256 evictions * 8 bytes = 2048 bytes`.

### Conclusion:
The total number of bytes written to memory during the loop is **2048 bytes**.
