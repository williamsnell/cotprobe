Alright, let's tackle this question. So, the question is asking which culture, previously known as the temple-mound builders, based their subsistence mainly on maize and squash agriculture. The options are A through J, with various names.

First, I need to break down what the question is asking. The key points are: temple-mound builders, maize and squash agriculture. I remember that several ancient cultures in North America built mounds, so I need to think about which ones are associated with temple mounds and which ones relied on those crops.

Starting with the term "temple-mound builders." I think the Mississippian culture is often referred to as the temple-mound builders. They built large earthen mounds, some of which were used for ceremonial purposes, hence temple mounds. Other cultures like the Hopewell also built mounds, but I'm not sure if they're called temple-mound builders specifically.

Now, regarding subsistence, maize (corn) and squash were major crops for many pre-Columbian cultures in the Americas. The Mississippian culture is known for extensive agriculture, including maize, which was their staple crop. They also grew squash and other plants.

Looking at the options:

A: Hohokam – I think they were more associated with the Southwest, possibly near what's now Arizona. They built mounds, but I'm not sure if they're temple-mound builders. Their subsistence included maize, but I'm not certain about squash being primary.

B: Folsom – This one rings a bell with the Folsom points, which are associated with early Paleoindian cultures. They were hunters, not agricultural, so probably not this one.

C: Adena – They built mounds, but I think their subsistence was more based on hunting and gathering, not necessarily maize and squash.

D: Ancestral Puebloan – They're known for the Anasazi and their cliff dwellings. Their agriculture included maize, but I'm not sure about squash as the primary. Plus, they're not temple-mound builders in the same way as Mississippian.

E: Mississippian – Fits the temple-mound description. Their mounds were significant, and they relied heavily on maize and squash. This seems like the right answer.

F: Clovis – Again, an early Paleoindian group known for their stone tools, not agriculture.

G: Moundville – This is actually a site, Moundville Archaeological Site, which was a Mississippian settlement. So, the culture would be Mississippian, not Moundville itself.

H: Poverty Point – They built earthworks, but I'm not sure if they're temple-mound builders. Their economy was more based on hunting and gathering, I think.

I: Fremont – Located in the Great Basin area. They did some agriculture but also relied on foraging. Not sure about maize and squash being primary.

J: Hopewell – They built mounds, but they were more into earthworks and were mound builders, but maybe not temple mounds. Their subsistence was a mix of farming and gathering.

So putting it together, the Mississippian culture fits both the temple-mound builder description and the reliance on maize and squash. So the answer should be E.

The correct answer is E: Mississippian.
