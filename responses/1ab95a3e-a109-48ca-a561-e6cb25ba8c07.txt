Alright, so I need to figure out the average difference in BMI between vegetarians and meat-eaters. I remember that BMI is a measure of body fat based on height and weight, and it's calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared.

I think vegetarians generally have a lower BMI than meat-eaters, but I'm not entirely sure by how much. Maybe it's a small difference? Or perhaps it's more significant. I've heard that vegetarians tend to have healthier lifestyles, which might include more exercise and better eating habits, which could contribute to a lower BMI.

I should consider studies or data that compare these groups. From what I recall, some research suggests that vegetarians have a lower average BMI. I'm trying to remember if the difference is around 1 unit or maybe a bit less. Wait, I think a study I read mentioned a difference of about 0.75 BMI units. That seems plausible because BMI is a broad measure and individual differences can vary.

Let me think about the options: the choices are from 0.25 up to 5 units. 0.25 seems too small; I don't think the difference is that minimal. 1 unit is possible, but I think I read it's a bit more than that. 0.75 makes sense because it's a noticeable difference without being too large. Other options like 2, 3, or 5 units seem too big for an average difference.

So, putting it all together, I'm leaning towards the answer being 0.75 units of BMI. That would be option C.

The average difference in BMI between vegetarians and meat-eaters is approximately 0.75 units. This is based on the understanding that vegetarians generally have a lower BMI due to healthier lifestyles and dietary habits.

Answer: C
