Alright, I need to figure out the correct answer to this question about daydreams and how they differ from dreams. Let's break it down step by step.

First, I'll read the question again: "Describe daydreams. How do they differ from dreams?" So, I need to compare the two and find the option that correctly explains the differences.

Looking at the options, each one offers a different perspective. I'll go through them one by one.

Option A says that both are involuntary, but daydreams happen while awake. That seems partly correct because daydreams are indeed during wakefulness, but I'm not sure if they're involuntary. Daydreams can sometimes feel like they're just happening, but maybe they're more controlled than that. Hmm, not sure yet.

Option B claims that dreams are about subconscious desires, while daydreams are just for entertainment. That doesn't sound right because I know daydreams often involve wishes or desires too, not just entertainment. So maybe B is incorrect.

Option C states that daydreams are remembered in detail, while dreams are quickly forgotten. I don't think that's accurate. I find that both can be remembered to varying degrees, but I'm not sure if daydreams are always more detailed. Maybe not the best choice.

Option D says daydreams occur only at night, which is definitely wrong. Daydreams happen during the day, while dreams are at night. So D is incorrect.

Option E: Daydreams are fantasies during waking, controlled and relate to reality, while dreams aren't controlled, and the person doesn't realize they're dreaming. This sounds plausible. Daydreams are indeed under conscious control and often based on real-life scenarios or wishes. Dreams, on the other hand, are involuntary and you're not aware you're dreaming while it's happening. That makes sense.

Option F says dreams are controlled by waking consciousness. No, that's not right. Dreams occur during sleep and are not under our control, so F is incorrect.

Option G claims daydreams are dreams during sleep. That's mixing up the two. Daydreams are during wakefulness, so G is wrong.

Option H suggests they share the same characteristics. That can't be right because daydreams and dreams are different in how they occur and awareness.

Option I: Daydreams are a type of dream while awake, involving wish fulfillment. Well, daydreams do involve wishes, but they're not considered a type of dream. Dreams happen during sleep, so I think I is incorrect.

Option J: Dreams are realistic, daydreams are fantastical. That's not always true. Both can have realistic and fantastical elements. So J might not be the best choice.

After evaluating, Option E seems to correctly differentiate daydreams and dreams. Daydreams are voluntary, controlled, and relate to reality, whereas dreams are involuntary, uncontrolled, and the person isn't aware they're dreaming.

The correct answer is E: Daydreams are fantasies created during a waking state which are controlled and closely related to reality, while dreams are not under control and the individual does not realize that he is dreaming.

Answer: E
