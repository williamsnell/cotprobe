Answer:
    
<think>
Okay, so I have this biology problem here about DNA transcription and translation. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question gives me two strands of DNA: strand1 and strand2. The task is to determine the mRNA molecule, the tRNA anticodons, and the amino acid sequence produced if strand1 is the transcription template for the mRNA.

Wait, I remember that in DNA, strands are antiparallel. So strand1 is the template, and strand2 is the coding strand. But wait, when making mRNA, it's based on the template strand, right? So the mRNA is complementary to the template strand and identical to the coding strand, except that T is replaced with U.

Let me look at the sequences. Strand1 is: A T G C G C T A C G G C A A T
Strand2 is: T A C G C G A T G C C G T T A

Wait, wait. DNA strands are complementary and antiparallel. So each base in strand1 pairs with the complementary base in strand2. So A pairs with T, T with A, C with G, G with C.

Let me write them out to see:

Strand1: A T G C G C T A C G G C A A T
Strand2: T A C G C G A T G C C G T T A

Wait, but looking at the first few bases: A in strand1 pairs with T in strand2. So that's correct. Same with T in strand1 pairing with A in strand2. So strand2 is indeed the complementary strand.

Now, since strand1 is the template for mRNA, the mRNA will be complementary to strand1. So mRNA will be made using strand1 as a template, using RNA nucleotides. So mRNA will have bases complementary to strand1, but with U instead of T.

So let's write out the mRNA sequence. Starting from the beginning, the first base of strand1 is A, so the mRNA will have U. Next, T becomes A, G becomes C, etc.

Wait, but wait: DNA is read in the 5' to 3' direction. So when making mRNA, we read the template strand (strand1) from 5' to 3', and the mRNA is synthesized in the 5' to 3' direction. So the mRNA will be complementary to strand1, but in the same direction as strand2.

Wait, maybe it's easier to write the mRNA as the reverse complement of strand1. Let me think.

Wait, strand1 is the template. So the mRNA will be complementary to strand1, but in the same direction as strand2. So if strand1 is read 5' to 3', the mRNA will be built as complementary to that, so the mRNA sequence should be the same as strand2, but with T replaced by U.

Wait, no. Because strand2 is the coding strand, which is the same as the mRNA but with T instead of U. So the mRNA would be the same as strand2, but with U's where there were T's.

Wait, perhaps I should write it out. Let me align the strands.

Strand1 (template): 5' - A T G C G C T A C G G C A A T - 3'
Strand2 (coding):   3' - T A C G C G A T G C C G T T A -5'

Wait, that makes sense because DNA strands are antiparallel. So when making mRNA, we read the template strand (strand1) from 5' to 3', and the mRNA is built complementary to that, so it will be the same as strand2 but with U instead of T.

So the mRNA sequence would be: A becomes U, T becomes A, G becomes C, etc. Wait no, because the mRNA is complementary to the template strand. So each base in the mRNA pairs with the template strand.

Wait, let me think again. The template strand is strand1: 5' A T G C G C T A C G G C A A T 3'

The mRNA will be synthesized as 5' to 3', complementary to strand1. So for each base in strand1, the mRNA will have the complementary base, but with U instead of T.

So the mRNA sequence would be:

strand1: 5' A T G C G C T A C G G C A A T 3'
mRNA:    5' U A C G C G A U G C C G U U A 3'

Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake because DNA strands are antiparallel. Let me double-check. The mRNA is synthesized using the template strand, which is strand1, so the mRNA will have the same sequence as strand2 but with U instead of T.

Strand2 is: T A C G C G A T G C C G T T A

So mRNA would be: A U C G C G U A C G G C A A U

Wait, no. Because strand2 is the coding strand, which is the same as mRNA except T becomes U.

Wait, perhaps I should write the mRNA as the same as strand2, but with U's where there were T's.

Strand2: T A C G C G A T G C C G T T A

So mRNA would be: A U C G C G U A C G G C A A U

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me approach this step by step.

1. Find the mRNA sequence.

Strand1 is the template, so the mRNA is complementary to strand1. Also, mRNA is synthesized in the 5' to 3' direction, so the mRNA will be the reverse complement of strand1, but with U instead of T.

So, let's write strand1 in 5' to 3' direction: A T G C G C T A C G G C A A T

The complementary mRNA is built as follows:

- A in DNA becomes U in mRNA
- T becomes A
- G becomes C
- C becomes G

But wait, since mRNA is complementary, each base in the template is matched.

Strand1 (template): A T G C G C T A C G G C A A T

So the mRNA would be:

- A (template) → U (mRNA)
- T → A
- G → C
- C → G
- G → C
- C → G
- T → A
- A → U
- C → G
- G → C
- G → C
- C → G
- A → U
- A → U
- T → A

Wait, but wait, the order might be reversed because mRNA is synthesized in the same direction as the coding strand. Let me think again.

Wait, the mRNA is synthesized from the template strand, which is read 5' to 3'. So the mRNA starts at the 3' end of the template, but I'm getting a bit tangled here.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to reverse the template strand and take the complement.

Strand1 (template): 5' A T G C G C T A C G G C A A T 3'

To find the mRNA, take the reverse complement of strand1, then replace T with U.

Reverse of strand1: T A A C G G C G A T G C G C T A (but wait, no, that's not correct because the strand is 5' to 3', so the reverse would be 3' to 5', which is the same as strand2's 5' to 3' is not matching. Maybe a better way is to write the complementary strand and then adjust for mRNA.

Wait, perhaps the mRNA is the same as strand2 but with T→U.

Strand2 is 3' T A C G C G A T G C C G T T A 5'

Wait, no, wait. The coding strand is the same as the mRNA but with T instead of U. So if strand2 is the coding strand, then the mRNA would be the same as strand2 but with T replaced by U.

Wait, strand2 is written as 3' T A C G C G A T G C C G T T A 5'

But wait, that can't be right because DNA strands are antiparallel. So strand1 (5'→3') is A T G C G C T A C G G C A A T, and strand2 (3'→5') is T A C G C G A T G C C G T T A.

So the coding strand is strand2, but written in 5'→3' direction, so it's A T G C G C T A C G G C A A T? No, that can't be because they should be complementary.

Wait, perhaps I should write both strands in the same direction for clarity.

Strand1 (5'→3'): A T G C G C T A C G G C A A T
Strand2 (3'→5'): T A C G C G A T G C C G T T A

So, to get the coding strand (strand2) in 5'→3' direction, it's the reverse complement of strand2's 3'→5' sequence.

Wait, maybe this is getting too complicated. Let me approach it differently.

The mRNA is synthesized using the template strand (strand1), so it's complementary to strand1. So the mRNA will be written as the reverse complement of strand1, but with U instead of T.

So, let's take strand1: 5' A T G C G C T A C G G C A A T 3'

The complementary strand would be 3' T A C G C G A T G C C G T T A 5' (which is strand2). But mRNA is built 5' to 3', so the mRNA would be the same as strand2 but with T→U.

So the mRNA sequence is:

Strand2: 5' A T G C G C T A C G G C A A U 3'

Wait, because strand2 in 5'→3' would be the reverse complement of strand1, which is the same as the mRNA except T→U.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try writing it again.

Strand1 (5'→3'): A T G C G C T A C G G C A A T

The mRNA is complementary to strand1, so each base in mRNA is the complement, but in the same direction as strand1.

So the mRNA would be: U A C G C G A U G C C G U U A

Wait, let me write it step by step.

Strand1: A → mRNA U
T → A
G → C
C → G
G → C
C → G
T → A
A → U
C → G
G → C
G → C
C → G
A → U
A → U
T → A

So the mRNA sequence is: U A C G C G A U G C C G U U A

Wait, but that seems a bit off. Let me group them into codons.

Wait, mRNA is read in triplets, starting from the 5' end. So the mRNA would be:

UAC GCG AU G CCG UUA

Wait, wait, let's split into codons:

Starting from the 5' end, which is the first base U.

U A C is the first codon: UAC
Then G C G: GCG
Then A U G: AUG
Then C C G: CCg
Then UUA: UUA

Wait, but wait, the mRNA sequence I wrote is U A C G C G A U G C C G U U A.

Let me count the letters: U, A, C, G, C, G, A, U, G, C, C, G, U, U, A.

That's 15 nucleotides, which is 5 codons.

So the mRNA codons would be:

1. UAC
2. GCG
3. A UG (but wait, that's only three letters: positions 7-9 would be A U G? No, wait, positions 7 is A, 8 is U, 9 is G? Wait, perhaps I should index them.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the mRNA sequence. Let me try again.

DNA strand1 (template): 5' A T G C G C T A C G G C A A T 3'

mRNA is complementary, so each base pairs as:

A → U
T → A
G → C
C → G
G → C
C → G
T → A
A → U
C → G
G → C
G → C
C → G
A → U
A → U
T → A

So mRNA sequence is 5' U A C G C G A U G C C G U U A 3'

Wait, that's 15 bases: U A C G C G A U G C C G U U A.

Wait, perhaps I can group them into codons, starting from the 5' end:

UAC GCG A UG CCG UUA

Wait, that doesn't seem right because the next part after GCG is A U G. Wait, but let me count.

Positions 1-3: U A C → UAC
4-6: G C G → GCG
7-9: A U G → AUG
10-12: C C G → CCG
13-15: U U A → UUA

Wait, but the mRNA sequence I have is UAC GCG A UG CCG UUA. Wait, no, because the 7th base is A, 8th is U, 9th is G. So that's AUG, which is methionine (Met).

So the codons are:

1. UAC
2. GCG
3. AUG
4. CCG
5. UUA

Wait, but wait, the mRNA is 5' UAC GCG A UG CCG UUA 3', which is 15 bases. So the codons would be UAC, GCG, A UG, CCG, UUA.

Wait, but wait, the fourth codon would be positions 10-12: C, C, G → CCG.

And the fifth codon is positions 13-15: U, U, A → UUA.

Now, let's translate each codon into an amino acid.

I need a codon table. Let me recall:

UAC → Tyrosine (Tyr)
GCG → Alanine (Ala)
AUG → Methionine (Met)
CCG → Proline (Pro)
UUA → Leucine (Leu)

Wait, wait, let me double-check:

- UAC: Tyrosine (Tyr)
- GCG: Alanine (Ala)
- AUG: Methionine (Met)
- CCG: Proline (Pro)
- UUA: Leucine (Leu)

So the amino acid sequence would be: Tyr-Ala-Met-Pro-Leu.

Wait, but wait, the order is based on the mRNA reading from 5' to 3', so the first codon is UAC (Tyr), then GCG (Ala), then AUG (Met), then CCG (Pro), then UUA (Leu).

So the amino acid sequence is Tyr-Ala-Met-Pro-Leu.

But looking at the options, let me look at option J: tyr-ala-met-pro-leu.

Wait, option J is "J: tyr-ala-met-pro-leu".

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is "met-pro-ala-tyr-leu" which doesn't match. Option B: met-ala-tyr-pro-leu. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the mRNA sequence. Let me check again.

Strand1 (template): 5' A T G C G C T A C G G C A A T 3'

mRNA is complementary, so:

A → U
T → A
G → C
C → G
G → C
C → G
T → A
A → U
C → G
G → C
G → C
C → G
A → U
A → U
T → A

So mRNA: 5' U A C G C G A U G C C G U U A 3'

Wait, perhaps I grouped them wrong. Let me list each position:

1. U
2. A
3. C → UAC (Tyr)
4. G
5. C
6. G → GCG (Ala)
7. A
8. U
9. G → A U G (AUG, Met)
10. C
11. C
12. G → CCG (Pro)
13. U
14. U
15. A → UUA (Leu)

So the order is Tyr, Ala, Met, Pro, Leu.

But looking at the options, option J is "tyr-ala-met-pro-leu", which matches.

Wait, but looking at the options, option J is "J: tyr-ala-met-pro-leu".

But another option, option C is "met-pro-ala-tyr-leu", which is different.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the mRNA sequence. Let me try again.

Wait, strand1 is the template, so the mRNA is built as complementary to strand1, 5' to 3'.

Strand1: 5' A T G C G C T A C G G C A A T 3'

So the mRNA will be:

5' U A C G C G A U G C C G U U A 3'

Wait, perhaps I should reverse it because mRNA is synthesized from 5' to 3', but the mRNA sequence is built in the same direction as the coding strand.

Wait, maybe I should think of it as the mRNA being the same as the coding strand (strand2), but with T→U.

Strand2 is 3' T A C G C G A T G C C G T T A 5'

Wait, so to get the coding strand in 5'→3' direction, it's the reverse complement of strand2.

Wait, strand2 is 3' T A C G C G A T G C C G T T A 5'

The reverse of strand2 is A T T G C C G T A G C G C A T A (but in 5'→3' direction).

Wait, this is getting too confusing. Let me try a different approach.

Since strand1 is the template, the mRNA is complementary to strand1, so the mRNA will be the same as strand2 but with T→U.

Strand2 is given as: T A C G C G A T G C C G T T A

So the mRNA would be: A U C G C G U A C G G C A A U.

Wait, because each T in strand2 would become U in mRNA.

So the mRNA sequence is: A U C G C G U A C G G C A A U.

Wait, but that's 14 bases, which doesn't make sense because the original strands are 15 bases each.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the length. Let me count the bases in strand1 and strand2.

Strand1: A T G C G C T A C G G C A A T → that's 15 bases.

Strand2: T A C G C G A T G C C G T T A → also 15 bases.

So the mRNA should be 15 bases as well.

Wait, if I take strand2 and replace T with U, I get:

Strand2 (coding): T A C G C G A T G C C G T T A → becomes A U C G C G U A C G G C A A U.

Wait, but that's only 14 bases because I'm replacing each T with U but perhaps I'm missing a base.

Wait, perhaps I should write it correctly.

Strand2 is 3' T A C G C G A T G C C G T T A 5'

So the mRNA, which is the same as strand2 but with T→U and written in 5'→3' direction, would be:

Strand2 in 5'→3' is the reverse complement of strand1, but for the mRNA, it's the same as strand2 but with T→U.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to write the mRNA as the reverse of the template's complement.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to write the mRNA sequence correctly.

Strand1 (template): 5' A T G C G C T A C G G C A A T 3'

The complementary mRNA would be 5' U A C G C G A U G C C G U U A 3'

So the mRNA sequence is: U A C G C G A U G C C G U U A.

Now, breaking into codons:

UAC GCG A UG CCG UUA.

Wait, but that would be UAC (Tyr), GCG (Ala), A UG (AUG, Met), CCG (Pro), UUA (Leu).

So the amino acid sequence is Tyr-Ala-Met-Pro-Leu.

Looking at the options, option J is "J: tyr-ala-met-pro-leu".

But wait, looking back at the options, option J is indeed that.

Wait, but let me check the options again.

Options:

A: ala-pro-met-tyr-leu

B: met-ala-tyr-pro-leu

C: met-pro-ala-tyr-leu

D: tyr-leu-pro-ala-met

E: ala-tyr-met-leu-pro

F: pro-tyr-ala-leu-met

G: leu-tyr-ala-met-pro

H: leu-pro-tyr-ala-met

I: pro-met-ala-leu-tyr

J: tyr-ala-met-pro-leu

So option J matches the sequence I derived: Tyr-Ala-Met-Pro-Leu.

But wait, I think I might have made a mistake in the mRNA grouping. Let me check again.

The mRNA is UAC GCG A UG CCG UUA.

Wait, that's five codons:

1. UAC → Tyr

2. GCG → Ala

3. A UG → AUG → Met

4. CCG → Pro

5. UUA → Leu

So the sequence is Tyr-Ala-Met-Pro-Leu, which is option J.
</think>

The question involves determining the mRNA molecule, tRNA anticodons, and the amino acid sequence produced from the given DNA strands, where strand1 is the transcription template. DNA strands are antiparallel, with strand1 (template) and strand2 (coding). The mRNA is synthesized complementary to the template strand (strand1), with T replaced by U.

### Step 1: Determine the mRNA sequence
Strand1 (template):  
`5' A T G C G C T A C G G C A A T 3'`

The mRNA is complementary to strand1, with T replaced by U. Thus, the mRNA sequence is:  
`5' U A C G C G A U G C C G U U A 3'`

### Step 2: Group the mRNA into codons
The mRNA sequence is split into codons (triplets) from the 5' end:  
`UAC, GCG, A UG, CCG, UUA`

### Step 3: Translate codons into amino acids
Using the genetic code:  
- `UAC` → Tyrosine (Tyr)  
- `GCG` → Alanine (Ala)  
- `AUG` → Methionine (Met)  
- `CCG` → Proline (Pro)  
- `UUA` → Leucine (Leu)  

The amino acid sequence is: **Tyr-Ala-Met-Pro-Leu**.

### Step 4: Match with the options
From the given options, **option J: tyr-ala-met-pro-leu** matches the derived sequence.

ANSWER: J
