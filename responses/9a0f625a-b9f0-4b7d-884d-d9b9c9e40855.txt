Question:

Company X shipped 5 computer chips, 1 of which was defective, and Company Y shipped 4 computer chips, 2 of which were defective. One computer chip is to be chosen uniformly at random from the 9 chips shipped by the companies. If the chosen chip is found to be defective, what is the probability that the chip came from Company Y?

Options:

A: 3 / 9
B: 4 / 9
C: 5 / 9
D: 5 / 6
E: 3 / 4
F: 1 / 3
G: 1 / 2
H: 2 / 9

Okay, so I've got this probability problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to understand what's being asked.

Alright, the setup is that there are two companies, X and Y, that each shipped some computer chips. Company X sent 5 chips, and out of those, 1 is defective. Company Y sent 4 chips, and 2 of theirs are defective. Now, someone is going to randomly pick one chip from all the chips shipped by both companies, so that's a total of 5 + 4 = 9 chips. The question is, if the chosen chip is defective, what's the probability that it came from Company Y? 

Hmm, okay, so this sounds like a conditional probability problem. I remember that conditional probability is about the probability of an event given that another event has occurred. The formula I think is P(A|B) = P(A and B) / P(B), where A is the event we're interested in, and B is the condition.

In this case, event A is "the chip is from Company Y," and event B is "the chip is defective." So we want P(Y | defective). According to the formula, that would be the probability that the chip is both from Y and defective divided by the probability that the chip is defective.

Let me break it down. First, I need to find P(defective), which is the total number of defective chips divided by the total number of chips. Company X has 1 defective out of 5, and Company Y has 2 defective out of 4. So total defective chips are 1 + 2 = 3. Total chips are 9. So P(defective) is 3/9, which simplifies to 1/3. Wait, but let's double-check that: 3 defective out of 9 total, yes, that's correct.

Next, I need P(Y and defective), which is the probability that the chip is both from Y and defective. Company Y has 2 defective chips out of the 9 total. So that probability is 2/9.

So putting it into the formula: P(Y|defective) = (2/9) / (3/9). Simplifying that, the 9s cancel out, so it's 2/3. Wait, wait, no, that can't be right because 2/9 divided by 3/9 is (2/9) * (9/3) = 2/3. Oh, wait, that's correct. So the probability is 2/3.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake. So another way to think about it is using the number of defective chips. There are 3 defective chips in total: 1 from X and 2 from Y. If a defective chip is picked, the chance it's from Y is the number of Y's defective divided by total defective. So that's 2/3.

Wait, but looking at the options, I see option I is 2/3, which would be the answer. But let me go through it again to be thorough.

Total chips: 5 from X (1 defective) and 4 from Y (2 defective). So total defective is 3, as I said. So when given that the chip is defective, the possible outcomes are 3 chips. Of those, 2 are from Y. So the probability is 2/3.

So the correct answer should be I: 2/3.

The probability that a defective chip came from Company Y is 2/3.
