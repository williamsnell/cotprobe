Okay, so I've got this physics problem about spaceships approaching Earth. Hmm, let me read it again carefully.

Alright, the question says that two spaceships are approaching Earth with equal speeds as measured by an Earth observer, but from opposite directions. So each spaceship is moving towards Earth at the same speed, but on opposite sides. Now, a meterstick on one spaceship is measured to be 60 cm long by an occupant of the other spaceship. I need to find the speed of each spaceship as measured by the Earth observer.

Wait, so the meterstick is on one spaceship, and someone on the other spaceship measures it as 60 cm. But in their own spaceship, the meterstick should be 100 cm, right? Because in its rest frame, the length should be the proper length.

This sounds like a problem involving special relativity, specifically length contraction. Because when an object is moving relative to an observer, its length in the direction of motion gets contracted.

So, the formula for length contraction is L = L0 * sqrt(1 - v²/c²), where L is the contracted length, L0 is the proper length (the rest length), and v is the relative velocity between the observer and the object.

In this case, the meterstick is on one spaceship, and the observer is on the other. So from the observer's frame (the other spaceship), the meterstick is moving, so its length is contracted to 60 cm. The proper length L0 is 100 cm (1 meter), so L is 60 cm.

Plugging into the formula: 60 = 100 * sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let's solve for v.

First, divide both sides by 100: 0.6 = sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

Then square both sides: 0.36 = 1 - v²/c².

Rearranging: v²/c² = 1 - 0.36 = 0.64.

Take the square root: v/c = sqrt(0.64) = 0.8.

So v = 0.8c. Wait, but wait a minute. Is that correct? Because the spaceships are moving at speed v as observed from Earth, but the observer in one spaceship measures the other's length.

Wait, I think I might have mixed up the frames here. Let me think again. The Earth observer sees both spaceships moving at speed v towards opposite directions. But the observer on one spaceship measures the other's meterstick.

So, in the frame of the observer on the moving spaceship, the other spaceship is approaching at speed u. Wait, no, wait. No, each spaceship is moving at v relative to Earth. So from the perspective of one spaceship, what is the speed of the other?

Hmm, because in special relativity, velocities don't just add linearly. The velocity of the second spaceship as seen from the first's frame is not simply 2v, because that would exceed c. Instead, we have to use the velocity addition formula.

The velocity addition formula is u' = (u + v)/(1 + (u v)/c²).

Wait, no, wait. Let me get the formula right. If an object is moving at speed u in Earth's frame, and Earth is moving at speed v in the other frame, then the speed u' in the other frame is u' = (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/c²), because when changing frames, it's (u - v)/(1 - (uv/c²)).

Wait, wait, no—wait, in this case, the Earth is moving at v relative to the spaceship. So from the spaceship's frame, Earth is approaching at v, and the other spaceship is approaching Earth at v as well. So what is the speed of the other spaceship as seen from the first spaceship?

Let me think: Earth sees spaceship A moving at v towards Earth, and spaceship B moving at v towards Earth but from the opposite direction. So from Earth's frame, A is moving at +v, and B is moving at -v (assuming Earth is at rest and the two are approaching from opposite sides).

Now, what is the speed of B as seen from A's frame? So according to the velocity addition formula, the speed u' of B in A's frame is given by u' = (u + v')/(1 + (u v')/c²) ?

Wait, I might be getting this wrong. Let's correct: the velocity addition formula when moving from frame S (Earth) to frame S' (spaceship A moving at speed v relative to S) is u' = (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/c²).

In this case, from Earth's frame, spaceship B is moving at u = -v (since it's approaching Earth from the opposite direction). So to find the speed of B in spaceship A's frame (S'), u' is calculated as (u - v_A)/(1 - (u v_A)/c²), where v_A is the velocity of S' (spaceship A) relative to S (Earth), which is v.

Wait, no, wait. Let me get this right. The velocity addition formula is:

u' = (u - v) / (1 - (u v)/c² )

where u is the velocity of the object in the original frame S (Earth), and v is the velocity of frame S' (spaceship A) relative to S. Since spaceship A is moving at +v (towards Earth), and spaceship B is moving at u = -v in Earth's frame.

So plugging into the formula: u' = [ (-v) - v ] / [1 - ( (-v) * v )/c² ]

Simplify numerator: (-v) - v = -2v.

Denominator: 1 - (-v²/c²) = 1 + v²/c².

So u' = (-2v) / (1 + (v²/c²)).

So the speed of spaceship B as seen from A's frame is |u'| = (2v)/(1 + (v²/c²)).

Wait, but in the problem statement, the observer in spaceship A measures the meterstick on spaceship B to be 60 cm. So the length contraction would be from the perspective of A, the moving frame relative to B.

Wait, no. Wait, spaceship B is moving at speed u' relative to A, so from A's frame, the length of B's meterstick would be L = L0 * sqrt(1 - (u')²/c²).

Wait, no: the length contraction formula says that an object moving at speed u' relative to the observer will have its length contracted by a factor of sqrt(1 - u'^2/c^2). So in this case, the proper length L0 is 100 cm, and the measured length is 60 cm. So:

60 = 100 * sqrt(1 - (u')²/c² )

Dividing both sides by 100: 0.6 = sqrt(1 - (u')²/c² )

Squaring: 0.36 = 1 - (u')²/c² → (u')²/c² = 0.64 → u' = 0.8c.

So u' is 0.8c. But from the velocity addition formula, we had u' = (2v)/(1 + (v²/c²)).

Wait, no, earlier calculation gave u' = (-2v)/(1 + (v^2/c^2)), but the speed magnitude is 2v/(1 + (v²/c²)).

So we have that u' = 0.8c, so:

2v/(1 + (v²/c²)) ) = 0.8c.

Let me write this equation again, using c as the speed of light.

So,

(2v)/(1 + (v²/c²)) ) = 0.8c.

Multiply both sides by denominator:

2v = 0.8c (1 + (v²/c²)) )

Multiply both sides by c² to eliminate denominators:

2v c² = 0.8c (c² + v² )

Divide both sides by c:

2v c = 0.8 (c² + v² )

Multiply both sides by 10 to eliminate decimals:

20 v c = 8 (c² + v² )

Expanding RHS: 8c² + 8v².

Bring all terms to one side:

8v² -20 v c + 8 c² = 0.

Hmm, this is a quadratic in terms of v. Let's write it as:

8v² -20 c v +8 c² =0.

We can divide all terms by 4 to simplify:

2v² -5 c v +2 c² =0.

Now, solving for v using quadratic formula.

Quadratic equation: a=2, b= -5c, c=2 c².

Wait, wait, in the equation 2v² -5c v +2c² =0.

The quadratic is in the form a v² + b v + c' =0, where a=2, b= -5c, c'=2c².

So, using the quadratic formula:

v = [5c ± sqrt( (5c)^2 - 4*2*2c² ) ]/(2*2)

Calculate discriminant D:

(5c)^2 =25 c²,

4*2*2c² =16 c².

So D=25 c² -16 c² =9 c².

Square root of D is 3c.

So,

v = [5c ±3c ]/(4).

So two solutions:

v = (5c +3c)/4 =8c/4=2c → which is impossible, as nothing can go faster than c.

v = (5c -3c)/4 =2c/4 =0.5c.

So v=0.5c.

Wait, that's 0.5c, which is option F.

But wait, earlier I thought the answer was 0.8c, but that was without considering the velocity addition correctly. Let me check again.

Wait, let me recap:

We found that the relative speed u' between the two spaceships is 0.8c because the length contraction gives us u'=0.8c.

Then, using the velocity addition formula, we set u' equal to (2v)/(1 + (v^2/c^2)), and solve for v.

Which gave us v=0.5c.

Let me check the calculation again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

The equation after substitution:

2v/(1 + (v^2/c^2)) ) = 0.8 c.

Let me plug v=0.5c into this equation.

v=0.5c.

Numerator: 2*(0.5c)=1c.

Denominator: 1 + ( (0.5c)^2 ) /c² =1 + (0.25 c²)/c²=1+0.25=1.25.

So, 1c /1.25=0.8c. Which matches. So yes, v=0.5c is correct.

So the speed of each spaceship as measured by Earth is 0.5c, which is option F.

Wait, but the options are given, so option F is 0.5c. So that's the correct answer.

The problem involves two spaceships approaching Earth with equal speeds, as measured by an Earth observer, but from opposite directions. A meterstick on one spaceship is measured to be 60 cm long by an occupant of the other spaceship. This scenario requires applying special relativity, specifically the concept of length contraction and relativistic velocity addition.

From the perspective of the observer in one spaceship, the meterstick on the other spaceship is contracted to 60 cm. Using the length contraction formula, \( L = L_0 \sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2} \), where \( L_0 = 100 \, \text{cm} \) (the proper length) and \( L = 60 \, \text{cm} \), we find the relative velocity \( u' \) between the two spaceships to be \( u' = 0.8c \).

Next, using the relativistic velocity addition formula, \( u' = \frac{2v}{1 + (v^2/c^2)} \), where \( u' = 0.8c \), we solve for \( v \). Substituting and simplifying, we find \( v = 0.5c \), which satisfies the equation and is consistent with the given conditions.

Thus, the speed of each spaceship, as measured by the Earth observer, is \( 0.5c \).
