Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about vapor pressure and molecular weight. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it step by step.

The problem says: The vapor pressure of benzene at 75°C is 640 torr. A solution made by dissolving 3.68 g of a solute in 53.0 g of benzene has a vapor pressure of 615 torr. I need to find the molecular weight of the solute. The options are A through J, with various g/mole values.

Alright, I remember that vapor pressure lowering is a colligative property, which depends on the mole fraction of the solute. The formula I think is:

Vapor pressure of solution (P₂) = Vapor pressure of pure solvent (P₁) * mole fraction of solvent (χ₁)

Wait, or is it the other way around? Oh right, the mole fraction of the solvent times the pure solvent's vapor pressure gives the solution's vapor pressure. So I can rearrange that to find the mole fraction of the solute or the solvent.

Let me jot down the given data.

P₁ (pure benzene) = 640 torr
P₂ (solution) = 615 torr
Mass of solute = 3.68 g
Mass of benzene = 53.0 g
Molecular weight (MW) of benzene = 78.0 g/mol

I need to find the molecular weight (MW) of the solute, which I'll call M.

First, let's find the mole fraction of the solvent (benzene). The formula is:

P₂ = P₁ * χ₁

So χ₁ = P₂ / P₁.

Plugging in the numbers: χ₁ = 615 / 640. Let me calculate that. 615 divided by 640 is approximately 0.9609375.

Wait, but I also know that the mole fraction of the solvent is (moles of solvent) / (total moles of solution), which is moles of benzene divided by (moles benzene + moles solute).

Let me denote moles of benzene as n₁ and moles of solute as n₂.

So, χ₁ = n₁ / (n₁ + n₂)

I can express n₁ as mass of benzene divided by its MW. So n₁ = 53.0 g / 78.0 g/mol. Let me compute that: 53 / 78 is approximately 0.679487 moles.

n₂ is the moles of solute, which is 3.68 g / M, where M is the molecular weight we're trying to find.

Putting it all together, χ₁ = (0.679487) / (0.679487 + (3.68/M))

But earlier I found χ₁ ≈ 0.9609375. So:

0.9609375 = 0.679487 / (0.679487 + (3.68/M))

Let me solve for M.

Multiply both sides by (0.679487 + (3.68/M)):

0.9609375 * (0.679487 + 3.68/M) = 0.679487

Divide both sides by 0.9609375:

0.679487 + (3.68/M) = 0.679487 / 0.9609375

Calculate 0.679487 / 0.9609375:

Approximately, 0.679487 ÷ 0.9609375 ≈ 0.707.

Wait, let me compute that accurately. 0.679487 ÷ 0.9609375.

Hmm, 0.9609375 is about 0.961, and 0.679487 is roughly 0.6795.

So 0.6795 / 0.961 ≈ 0.707. So:

0.679487 + (3.68/M) ≈ 0.707

Subtract 0.679487 from both sides:

(3.68/M) ≈ 0.707 - 0.679487 ≈ 0.027513

So 3.68 / M ≈ 0.027513.

Solving for M:

M ≈ 3.68 / 0.027513 ≈ ?

Let me compute that. 3.68 divided by 0.027513.

3.68 ÷ 0.027513 ≈ 133.8 g/mol.

Wait, that's one of the options. Let me check the options again. Option J is 133.8 g/mol.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

First, mole fraction of solvent: 615/640 = 0.9609375. Correct.

n₁ = 53/78 = 0.679487 moles. Correct.

χ₁ = n₁ / (n₁ + n₂) => 0.9609375 = 0.679487 / (0.679487 + n₂)

Wait, n₂ = 3.68/M. So:

0.9609375 = 0.679487 / (0.679487 + (3.68/M))

Cross-multiplied:

0.9609375 * (0.679487 + 3.68/M) = 0.679487

Expanding:

0.9609375 * 0.679487 + 0.9609375 * (3.68/M) = 0.679487

Compute 0.9609375 * 0.679487:

Approximately 0.679487 * 0.96 ≈ 0.652. Let me calculate more accurately.

0.9609375 * 0.679487:

= (0.9609375) * 0.679487 ≈ 0.6523 (exact value?)

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute 0.9609375 * 0.679487.

Let me compute this: 0.9609375 * 0.679487 ≈ 0.9609375 * 0.679487.

I can use a calculator here, but since I'm doing this manually, perhaps approximate.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to proceed with the equation as I did before.

So, 0.9609375 * (0.679487 + 3.68/M) = 0.679487

Divide both sides by 0.9609375:

0.679487 + 3.68/M = 0.679487 / 0.9609375

Which is approximately 0.707.

So 3.68/M ≈ 0.707 - 0.679487 = 0.027513.

So M ≈ 3.68 / 0.027513 ≈ 133.8.

Yes, that seems right. So the molecular weight is approximately 133.8 g/mol, which is option J.

The vapor pressure lowering is calculated using the formula:

\[
P_2 = P_1 \cdot \chi_1
\]

Given:
- \( P_1 = 640 \, \text{torr} \)
- \( P_2 = 615 \, \text{torr} \)
- Mass of benzene = \( 53.0 \, \text{g} \)
- Mass of solute = \( 3.68 \, \text{g} \)
- \( \text{MW of benzene} = 78.0 \, \text{g/mol} \)

The mole fraction of benzene (\( \chi_1 \)) is:

\[
\chi_1 = \frac{P_2}{P_1} = \frac{615}{640} \approx 0.9609
\]

The mole fraction of benzene is also:

\[
\chi_1 = \frac{n_1}{n_1 + n_2}
\]

where \( n_1 \) is the moles of benzene and \( n_2 \) is the moles of solute. 

\[
n_1 = \frac{\text{Mass of benzene}}{\text{MW of benzene}} = \frac{53.0}{78.0} \approx 0.6795 \, \text{mol}
\]

\[
n_2 = \frac{\text{Mass of solute}}{\text{MW of solute}} = \frac{3.68}{M}
\]

Substituting into the mole fraction equation:

\[
0.9609 = \frac{0.6795}{0.6795 + \frac{3.68}{M}}
\]

Solving for \( M \):

\[
0.9609 \cdot \left( 0.6795 + \frac{3.68}{M} \right) = 0.6795
\]

\[
0.6795 + \frac{3.68}{M} = \frac{0.6795}{0.9609} \approx 0.707
\]

\[
\frac{3.68}{M} = 0.707 - 0.6795 \approx 0.0275
\]

\[
M = \frac{3.68}{0.0275} \approx 133.8 \, \text{g/mol}
\]

Thus, the molecular weight of the solute is approximately **133.8 g/mol**, which corresponds to option J.
