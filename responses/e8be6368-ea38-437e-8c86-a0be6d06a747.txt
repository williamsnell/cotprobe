Question:

On arrival, she is unable to provide a history. Her pulse is 96/min, respirations are 12/min, and blood pressure is 124/58 mm Hg. Examination shows erythema, warmth, and induration of the upper back, buttocks, and posterior thighs. Her serum creatine kinase activity is 10,300 U/L. Urine toxicology screening is positive for opiates and cocaine. Urine dipstick is strongly positive for blood. Microscopic examination of the urine shows pigmented granular casts and rare erythrocytes. This patient is at increased risk for which of the following conditions over the next 24 hours?

Options:

A: Pulmonary embolism
B: Acute liver failure
C: Myocardial infarction
D: Septic shock
E: Acute respiratory distress syndrome
F: Cerebral edema
G: Cerebral hemorrhage
H: Pancreatitis
I: Acute renal failure
J: Acute tubular necrosis

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out what condition this patient is at increased risk for over the next 24 hours. Let me go through the information step by step.

First, the patient is a 37-year-old woman who was found unconscious. She didn't come to work, so her coworkers found her. That's concerning because it suggests she might have been unwell for a while or had an acute event.

Her vital signs are pulse 96/min, which is a bit on the higher side but not critically high. Respirations are 12/min, which is within normal range. Blood pressure is 124/58 mmHg. That's interesting because the diastolic is a bit low (normal is around 60-80), but not dangerously so. Maybe she's a bit hypotensive, but not in shock yet.

Physical exam findings: erythema, warmth, and induration in the upper back, buttocks, and posterior thighs. That sounds like some sort of tissue damage or inflammation. Maybe rhabdomyolysis? Because muscle breakdown can cause these symptoms, especially in the back and thighs.

Her serum creatine kinase (CK) level is 10,300 U/L. I remember that CK levels are elevated in rhabdomyolysis. Normal CK levels are usually around 50-400 U/L, so 10,000 is way above that. Rhabdomyolysis can lead to muscle cell death, which releases myoglobin into the bloodstream. Myoglobin can cause dark urine and, if it's filtered through the kidneys, might lead to acute kidney injury.

Urine toxicology is positive for opiates and cocaine. So she's using both, which might contribute to her current state. Opiates can cause respiratory depression, which could lead to hypoxia or even respiratory failure if severe. Cocaine can cause vasoconstriction, increasing the risk of hypertension or arrhythmias, but in this case, her blood pressure isn't that high. However, both drugs can contribute to altered mental status, which explains why she was found unconscious.

The urine dipstick is strongly positive for blood. Microscopic examination shows pigmented granular casts and rare erythrocytes. Pigmented granular casts are often seen in chronic kidney disease or acute kidney injury, as the cells in the casts are breaking down. The presence of blood in the urine (hematuria) could be from muscle breakdown (myoglobinuria) or from kidney damage.

Putting this together: high CK levels suggest rhabdomyolysis. Rhabdomyolysis can lead to myoglobin release, which can cause acute kidney injury (AKI) because myoglobin is toxic to the renal tubules. The pigmented granular casts in the urine support this. Also, the positive urine for blood and myoglobin would make her urine appear dark, which isn't mentioned but is common in rhabdomyolysis.

Looking at the options:

A: Pulmonary embolism – possible, but I don't see signs like dyspnea, chest pain, or ECG changes. She's more likely presenting with muscle symptoms.

B: Acute liver failure – no signs of jaundice, encephalopathy, or other liver-related issues.

C: Myocardial infarction – no chest pain, ECG changes, or risk factors like high cholesterol or diabetes mentioned.

D: Septic shock – she doesn't have signs of infection or sepsis, like high fever, chills, or leukocytosis.

E: Acute respiratory distress syndrome – no signs of severe respiratory distress or ARDS criteria.

F: Cerebral edema – would present with neurological signs, which aren't highlighted here.

G: Cerebral hemorrhage – no evidence of stroke or sudden neurological deficits.

H: Pancreatitis – no abdominal pain, nausea, or elevated amylase/lipase levels mentioned.

I: Acute renal failure – this fits with rhabdomyolysis causing AKI.

J: Acute tubular necrosis – this is a type of AKI, often caused by rhabdomyolysis, so this is also a possibility.

So the options I and J are both related to the kidneys. Acute tubular necrosis (ATN) is a specific cause of acute renal failure. In rhabdomyolysis, the myoglobin can cause direct tubular damage, leading to ATN. Therefore, the patient is at risk for acute tubular necrosis, which is a subset of acute renal failure.

Wait, but the question is asking for the condition she's at increased risk for over the next 24 hours. Rhabdomyolysis can lead to AKI, and in severe cases, acute tubular necrosis. So J is a more specific answer, while I is a broader category. Since the options include both, I need to see which is more precise.

The question is about the increased risk. Since the patient has rhabdomyolysis, the immediate risk is acute kidney injury, which can progress to acute tubular necrosis if not treated. So both I and J are correct, but the question gives both as options. However, in clinical terms, acute tubular necrosis is a specific cause, so J is the more accurate answer.

Wait, but sometimes the options are mutually exclusive. Let me think again. The patient has high CK, myoglobinuria, and signs of kidney involvement. So the next 24 hours, she's at risk for acute renal failure (I) or acute tubular necrosis (J). ATN is a form of acute kidney injury, so if J is an option, it's more specific. But if the question is about the condition she's at risk for, then acute renal failure (I) is the broader term. However, the options are separate, so I need to pick the best fit.

Alternatively, the presence of pigmented granular casts suggests chronic kidney disease, but in this case, the acute presentation points more to acute issues.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is I: Acute renal failure, as it's a broader term, but J is more specific. But in the context of rhabdomyolysis, the immediate risk is acute tubular necrosis, so J might be the answer.

Wait, the options are I and J. So, in this case, the patient has rhabdomyolysis leading to acute kidney injury, which is often due to acute tubular necrosis. So the most specific answer would be J: Acute tubular necrosis. But sometimes, acute renal failure is the term used, so I might also be correct. I think in the context of the options given, J is the better answer because it's the specific cause related to rhabdomyolysis.

Wait, but in the initial assessment, the presence of pigmented granular casts might suggest chronic issues, but the acute presentation suggests an acute process. I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. Pigmented granular casts are associated with chronic kidney disease, but in the context of acute kidney injury, they might also appear. Alternatively, the presence of myoglobin in the urine can lead to tubular damage, causing acute tubular necrosis.

So, considering all this, the patient is at risk for acute tubular necrosis (J) as a complication of rhabdomyolysis. Therefore, the answer is J.
</think>

The patient is a 37-year-old woman presenting with unconsciousness, elevated creatine kinase levels, and findings suggestive of rhabdomyolysis. Rhabdomyolysis can lead to the release of myoglobin into the bloodstream, which is toxic to the renal tubules, potentially causing acute tubular necrosis (ATN). ATN is a specific form of acute kidney injury (AKI) and is the immediate risk in this patient. While acute renal failure (I) is a broader term, the specific complication here is acute tubular necrosis.

Answer: J
