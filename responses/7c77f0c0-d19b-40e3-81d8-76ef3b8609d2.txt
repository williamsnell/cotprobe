Okay, so I have this problem about liquid nitrogen and the empty space in it based on the hard-sphere model. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question says that the molecular diameter of N2 is given as 3.15 × 10^-8 cm. The density of liquid nitrogen is 0.8081 g/cm³. I need to find the fraction of the liquid volume that's empty space using the hard-sphere model.

Wait, the hard-sphere model assumes that molecules are rigid spheres that don't overlap. So the packing efficiency would be the volume occupied by the molecules divided by the total volume. The empty space would then be 1 minus that efficiency.

First, I think I need to find the volume occupied by the nitrogen molecules in a given volume of liquid. Let me think about how to approach this.

Density (d) is mass (m) over volume (V), so d = m/V. Rearranging, V = m/d. But wait, I need to find the volume occupied by the molecules. Alternatively, maybe I should find the number of moles first, then the number of molecules, and from that, the total volume occupied by the molecules.

Yes, that makes sense. So, step by step:

1. Find the molar mass of N2. Nitrogen has an atomic weight of about 14 g/mol, so N2 is 28 g/mol.

2. Calculate the number of moles in a given volume. Let's pick a volume for simplicity, say 1 cm³, because density is given per cm³. So mass in 1 cm³ is 0.8081 g. Moles = mass / molar mass = 0.8081 g / 28 g/mol ≈ 0.02886 mol.

3. Number of molecules: moles × Avogadro's number. Avogadro's number is 6.022 × 10^23 molecules/mol. So 0.02886 mol × 6.022e23 ≈ 1.738e22 molecules.

4. Now, each molecule is a sphere with diameter 3.15e-8 cm, so radius is half that, 1.575e-8 cm.

The volume of a single sphere is (4/3)πr³. Let's compute that. Plugging in r = 1.575e-8 cm:

Volume per molecule = (4/3) * π * (1.575e-8)^3.

Let me calculate that step by step. First, cube the radius: (1.575e-8)^3 = (1.575)^3 × 10^-24 ≈ 3.8906 × 10^-24 cm³.

Multiply by (4/3)π: 3.8906e-24 * (4/3)*3.1416 ≈ 3.8906e-24 * 4.1888 ≈ 1.622e-23 cm³ per molecule.

Now, total volume occupied by all molecules is number of molecules × volume per molecule. So 1.738e22 molecules × 1.622e-23 cm³/molecule.

Let me calculate that: 1.738e22 * 1.622e-23 = (1.738 * 1.622) × 10^-1 ≈ 2.813 × 0.1 = 0.2813 cm³.

Wait, but wait, I'm looking at 1 cm³ of liquid, right? So the total volume occupied by the molecules is 0.2813 cm³.

But that can't be right because if the liquid volume is 1 cm³ and the molecules occupy only 0.2813 cm³, the empty space would be 1 - 0.2813 = 0.7187, which is about 71.87%. Looking at the options, F is 71.30%, which is close. Hmm, but maybe I made a calculation error somewhere.

Wait, let me double-check the steps.

Molar mass of N2 is correct at 28 g/mol.

Density is 0.8081 g/cm³, so 1 cm³ has 0.8081 g, which is 0.8081 / 28 = 0.02886 mol. Correct.

Avogadro's number: 6.022e23. So 0.02886 * 6.022e23 = approx 1.738e22 molecules. That seems right.

Diameter is 3.15e-8 cm, so radius is 1.575e-8 cm. Correct.

Volume of one sphere: (4/3)πr³.

r³ is (1.575e-8)^3. Let me calculate that more accurately.

1.575^3 = 1.575 * 1.575 = approx 2.4806, then *1.575 ≈ 3.8906. So 3.8906e-24 cm³. Multiply by (4/3)*π: (4/3)*3.1416 ≈ 4.1888. So 3.8906e-24 *4.1888 ≈ 1.622e-23 cm³ per molecule.

Number of molecules is 1.738e22, so total volume is 1.738e22 * 1.622e-23 = (1.738 * 1.622) * 1e-1.

1.738 * 1.622: Let's compute that accurately.

1.7 * 1.6 = 2.72, 1.7 * 0.222≈0.3774, 0.038 *1.6=0.0608, 0.038*0.222≈0.008436. Adding up: 2.72 + 0.3774=3.0974 +0.0608=3.1582 +0.008436≈3.1666. So approx 3.1666e-1 = 0.31666 cm³.

Wait, wait, that's different from before. Wait, 1.738e22 * 1.622e-23 = (1.738 * 1.622) * 1e22 * 1e-23 = (1.738 * 1.622) * 1e-1.

Wait, 1.738 * 1.622: Let's compute it precisely.

1.738 * 1.622:

1.738 * 1 = 1.738

1.738 * 0.6 = 1.0428

1.738 * 0.02 = 0.03476

1.738 * 0.002 = 0.003476

Adding them up: 1.738 +1.0428=2.7808 +0.03476=2.81556 +0.003476≈2.81904.

So 2.81904 * 1e-1 = 0.281904 cm³. Hmm, so the total volume of all molecules is 0.2819 cm³.

So in 1 cm³ of liquid, the molecules occupy 0.2819 cm³, so the fraction of empty space is 1 - (0.2819 / 1) = 0.7181 or 71.81%.

Looking at the options, F is 71.30%, which is close. Hmm, but my calculation gives about 71.81%, but F is 71.30. Maybe I did a miscalculation somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the volume per molecule. Let me recheck that.

r = 1.575e-8 cm.

r^3 = (1.575e-8)^3 = (1.575)^3 × 1e-24 cm³.

1.575^3: Let's compute it accurately.

1.575 * 1.575 = ?

1.5 *1.5 = 2.25.

1.5 *0.075=0.1125.

0.075*1.5=0.1125.

0.075*0.075=0.005625.

Wait, perhaps better to compute 1.575^2: 1.575 *1.575.

1.575 *1.575:

= (1 + 0.575)^2 = 1^2 + 2*1*0.575 + 0.575^2 = 1 + 1.15 + 0.330625 = 2.480625.

Then multiply by 1.575 again: 2.480625 * 1.575.

Let me compute 2.480625 * 1.575.

Break it down:

2 * 1.575 = 3.15

0.480625 * 1.575:

Compute 0.4 * 1.575 = 0.63

0.08 *1.575 = 0.126

0.000625 *1.575= ~0.000984375.

Adding up: 0.63 +0.126=0.756 +0.000984375≈0.756984375.

So total is 3.15 + 0.756984375 ≈ 3.906984375.

So 1.575^3 ≈3.906984 cm³ ×1e-24 cm³, so 3.906984e-24 cm³.

Then, volume per molecule is (4/3)πr³ = (4/3)*3.1416*3.906984e-24.

Compute (4/3)*3.1416 ≈4.1888.

4.1888 *3.906984e-24 ≈ 4.1888 *3.906984 ≈ let's compute that.

4 *3.906984 ≈15.627936.

0.1888 *3.906984 ≈ approx 0.1888*3.9 ≈0.73632.

So total ≈15.627936 +0.73632≈16.364256e-24 cm³.

Wait, no, wait: 3.906984e-24 *4.1888 = (3.906984 *4.1888) ×1e-24.

3.906984 *4.1888 ≈ let me compute this accurately.

3.906984 *4 =15.627936.

3.906984 *0.1888≈0.73632.

So total ≈15.627936 +0.73632 ≈16.364256.

So 16.364256e-24 cm³ per molecule.

Wait, but earlier I thought it was 1.622e-23 cm³ per molecule. Wait, 16.364256e-24 is 1.6364e-23 cm³. So approximately 1.636e-23 cm³ per molecule.

So each molecule's volume is about 1.636e-23 cm³.

Number of molecules is 1.738e22.

Total volume occupied by molecules: 1.738e22 *1.636e-23 = (1.738 *1.636) ×1e-1.

1.738 *1.636:

Let me compute 1.7 *1.636 = approx 2.7812.

0.038 *1.636 ≈0.062168.

So total ≈2.7812 +0.062168≈2.8434.

So 2.8434e-1 = 0.28434 cm³.

So in 1 cm³ of liquid, the molecules occupy 0.28434 cm³. Therefore, the empty space is 1 -0.28434 =0.71566, which is 71.566%.

Looking at the options, F is 71.30% and C is 75.80%. Hmm, my calculation is about 71.57%, which is closest to F, 71.30%.

Wait, but wait—maybe I should consider the exact value.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of molecules. Let me recheck that.

Density is 0.8081 g/cm³. So 1 cm³ is 0.8081 g.

Molar mass of N2 is 28 g/mol. So moles = 0.8081 /28 = let's compute precisely.

0.8081 /28 = 0.0288607 moles.

Number of molecules is 0.0288607 mol * 6.022e23 molecules/mol = 0.0288607 *6.022e23.

Compute 0.0288607 *6.022 = ?

0.0288607 *6 = 0.1731642.

0.0288607 *0.022≈0.0006349.

Adding them gives ≈0.1738.

So 0.1738e23 = 1.738e22 molecules. So that part seems correct.

So total volume of molecules: 1.738e22 *1.636e-23 = (1.738 *1.636) *1e-1.

Let me compute 1.738 ×1.636 exactly.

1.738 ×1.636:

Break it down as (1 + 0.738) × (1.6 + 0.036).

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute 1.738 ×1.636 step by step.

1.738 ×1 =1.738

1.738 ×0.6 =1.0428

1.738 ×0.03 =0.05214

1.738 ×0.006=0.010428

Adding them up: 1.738 +1.0428=2.7808 +0.05214=2.83294 +0.010428≈2.843368.

So 2.843368e-1 =0.2843368 cm³.

So the fraction is (1 - 0.2843368) = 0.7156632, which is 71.56632%.

Looking at the options, F is 71.30% and C is 75.80%. Hmmm, 71.57% is closer to F (71.30%) than to any other option. Maybe the slight discrepancy is due to rounding in the given diameter or other constants.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the molecular diameter is given as 3.15e-8 cm, which is 3.15 angstroms (since 1 angstrom is 1e-8 cm). But wait, wait, no—1 angstrom is 1e-8 cm, so 3.15e-8 cm is 3.15 angstroms, but nitrogen molecules are actually smaller. Wait, maybe I got the units wrong. Oh no, wait—no, the problem gives the diameter as 3.15 ×10^-8 cm, which is correct. So no issue there.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the packing efficiency isn't 100%, but in the hard-sphere model, the packing fraction is the maximum possible, which for close-packed structures (like FCC or HCP) is about 74%, but in liquids, it's less. Wait, but the question says to use the hard-sphere model, which assumes random close packing. Wait, no—the hard-sphere model for liquid structure often assumes a packing fraction around 70-75%, but in this calculation, I'm just considering the total volume occupied by the spheres without considering overlaps, which isn't exactly how it works. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, perhaps the approach is correct. So according to my calculation, the empty space is about 71.57%, which is closest to option F, 71.30%.
</think>

To determine the fraction of empty space in liquid nitrogen based on the hard-sphere model, the following steps were taken:

1. **Molar Mass and Moles Calculation**:  
   The molar mass of N₂ is 28 g/mol. Given the density of liquid nitrogen as 0.8081 g/cm³, the number of moles in 1 cm³ is:  
   \[
   \text{Moles} = \frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Molar Mass}} = \frac{0.8081 \, \text{g}}{28 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.02886 \, \text{mol}.
   \]

2. **Number of Molecules**:  
   Using Avogadro's number (\(6.022 \times 10^{23} \, \text{molecules/mol}\)), the number of molecules in 1 cm³ is:  
   \[
   \text{Molecules} = 0.02886 \, \text{mol} \times 6.022 \times 10^{23} \, \text{molecules/mol} \approx 1.738 \times 10^{22} \, \text{molecules}.
   \]

3. **Volume of a Single Molecule**:  
   The molecular diameter of N₂ is \(3.15 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{cm}\), so the radius is \(1.575 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{cm}\). The volume of a single sphere is:  
   \[
   V_{\text{molecule}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 = \frac{4}{3} \pi (1.575 \times 10^{-8})^3 \approx 1.636 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{cm}^3.
   \]

4. **Total Volume Occupied by Molecules**:  
   The total volume occupied by all molecules in 1 cm³ is:  
   \[
   V_{\text{total}} = \text{Number of Molecules} \times V_{\text{molecule}} = (1.738 \times 10^{22}) \times (1.636 \times 10^{-23}) \approx 0.2843 \, \text{cm}^3.
   \]

5. **Fraction of Empty Space**:  
   The fraction of empty space is:  
   \[
   \text{Empty Space} = 1 - \frac{V_{\text{total}}}{V_{\text{liquid}}} = 1 - \frac{0.2843}{1} \approx 0.7157 \, \text{or} \, 71.57\%.
   \]

Among the given options, the closest value is **71.30%**, which corresponds to **option F**.

**Answer:** F
