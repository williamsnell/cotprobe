Question:

Consider the following code segment.
 int num1 = value1, num2 = value2, num3 = value3;
 while (num1 > num2 || num1 > num3)
 {
 /* body of loop */
 }
 You may assume that value1, value2, and value3 are int values. Which of the following is sufficient to guarantee that /* body of loop */will never be executed?

Options:

A: num1 < num3
B: num1 == num3 && num1 > num2
C: num1 > num2 || num1 < num3
D: num1 < num2 && num1 < num3
E: num1 == num2 && num1 > num3
F: num1 < num2 || num1 < num3
G: num1 == num2 || num1 == num3
H: num1 < num2
I: num1 > num2 && num1 > num3

Okay, so I have this problem here about a while loop in C, and I need to figure out under what condition the body of the loop will never execute. Let me think through this step by step.

The code is:

int num1 = value1, num2 = value2, num3 = value3;
while (num1 > num2 || num1 > num3) {
    /* body of loop */
}

The question is asking which condition would ensure that the loop's body never runs. So, I need to find a scenario where the condition in the while loop is always false from the start, meaning the loop doesn't execute even once.

First, let's understand the loop condition: it's a logical OR between two comparisons. The loop will run as long as either num1 is greater than num2 OR num1 is greater than num3. So, the loop continues if at least one of these is true.

To make sure the loop body never executes, the condition must be false on the first check. That means both parts of the OR must be false. So, num1 must NOT be greater than num2, and num1 must NOT be greater than num3. In other words, num1 <= num2 AND num1 <= num3.

Wait, no, wait. Because the condition is OR, the loop runs if either is true. So for the condition to be false, both must be false. So the initial condition for the loop to not run at all is that num1 is not greater than num2 AND num1 is not greater than num3. That would mean num1 is less than or equal to both num2 and num3. But wait, in the options, I need to find which condition makes the loop's condition false.

So looking at the options:

Option D says num1 < num2 && num1 < num3. That's exactly what we're looking for. Because if num1 is less than both, then the loop condition (num1 > num2 || num1 > num3) becomes false. So the loop body won't execute.

Let me check other options to make sure I'm not missing something.

Option A: num1 < num3. But num1 could be greater than num2, so the loop condition might still be true. So this isn't sufficient.

Option B: num1 == num3 and num1 > num2. Here, num1 is equal to num3, so the first part of the OR is false (num1 > num3 is false). But num1 is greater than num2, so the OR is true. So the loop runs. So B doesn't prevent the loop.

Option C: num1 > num2 OR num1 < num3. Wait, no, the condition is about making the loop not run. So if num1 is less than num3, the OR would depend on whether num1 > num2. So this doesn't necessarily make the loop condition false.

Option D: num1 < num2 AND num1 < num3. Yes, as discussed, this makes both parts of the OR condition false, so loop doesn't run.

Option E: num1 == num2 and num1 > num3. Here, since num1 > num3, the OR condition is true, so loop runs.

Option F: num1 < num2 OR num1 < num3. Even if one is true, but if the other is false, the OR could be true. For example, if num1 < num2 is true but num1 > num3 is also true, then the loop runs. So F isn't sufficient.

Option G: num1 == num2 or num1 == num3. If num1 is equal to one, but greater than the other, the loop condition might still be true. So G doesn't guarantee the loop doesn't run.

Option H: num1 < num2. But if num1 > num3, the loop condition is true. So H alone isn't enough.

Option I: num1 > num2 AND num1 > num3. Wait, no, that would make the loop condition true, causing the loop to run. So I is the opposite of what we want.

So the correct option is D, because it ensures that num1 is less than both num2 and num3, making the loop condition false.

The loop condition is `num1 > num2 || num1 > num3`. For the loop body to never execute, this condition must be false initially. This happens when both `num1 <= num2` and `num1 <= num3`. Option D states `num1 < num2 && num1 < num3`, ensuring both conditions are met, making the loop condition false. 

Answer: D
