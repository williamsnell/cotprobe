Okay, let's try to figure out this problem step by step. So, Mrs. Valdez has to pay a property tax and a collection fee. The total charge is $70.62, and we need to find out the assessed valuation of her home.

First, I remember that the property tax rate is 2.432%. But there's also a collection fee of 1% on the tax. Hmm, so the total charge includes both the tax and the fee. I think the fee is calculated on the tax amount, not directly on the assessed value.

Let me break it down. Let's call the assessed valuation "V". The property tax would be 2.432% of V, which is 0.02432 * V. Then, the collection fee is 1% of that tax, so that's 0.01 * (0.02432 * V). 

So the total charge is the sum of the tax and the fee. That would be:

Total = Tax + Fee
Total = (0.02432 * V) + (0.01 * 0.02432 * V)

Let me compute that. The fee is 1% of the tax, so it's 0.01 times the tax. So the fee is 0.0002432 * V. So adding that to the tax:

Total = 0.02432V + 0.0002432V = (0.02432 + 0.0002432)V = 0.0245632V

Wait, that seems right. So the total charge is 0.0245632 times the assessed value. We know the total is $70.62, so:

70.62 = 0.0245632 * V

To find V, we can rearrange that:

V = 70.62 / 0.0245632

Let me calculate that. Let's see, 70.62 divided by 0.0245632. Hmm, maybe I can approximate this.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think about it as percentages. The total charge is 2.432% plus 0.02432% (since 1% of 2.432% is 0.02432%). Wait, that adds up to 2.45632%, so the total is 2.45632% of V equals $70.62.

So to find V, it's 70.62 divided by 0.0245632.

Let me compute that division. Let's see, 70.62 ÷ 0.0245632.

First, I can approximate 0.0245632 as about 0.02456. So 70.62 / 0.02456.

Hmm, perhaps using a calculator would help, but since I don't have one, I'll try to estimate.

Alternatively, I can think of it as V = 70.62 / (0.02432 + 0.0002432) = 70.62 / 0.0245632.

Wait, maybe I can set it up as:

0.0245632 * V = 70.62

So V = 70.62 / 0.0245632 ≈ ?

Let me try to compute this. Let me think in terms of fractions. 0.0245632 is approximately 2.45632%. So, 70.62 is 2.45632% of V.

Another approach: 1% of V is V/100. So, 2.45632% is 2.45632*(V/100) = 0.0245632V.

So, 0.0245632V = 70.62 → V = 70.62 / 0.0245632.

Let me calculate this. Let's compute 70.62 ÷ 0.0245632.

First, I can write this as 70.62 / 0.0245632 ≈ ?

Let me approximate 0.0245632 as 0.02456.

So, 70.62 ÷ 0.02456 ≈ 70.62 / 0.02456.

Let me compute this step by step.

I can think of it as 70.62 ÷ 0.02456 = 70.62 ÷ 2.456 × 1000.

Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 0.02456 is 2.456 × 10^-2. So when I divide by 0.02456, it's the same as multiplying by (1/0.02456) = approximately 40.69.

Wait, because 1/0.02456 ≈ 40.69.

So, 70.62 × 40.69 ≈ ?

Let me compute that:

70 × 40.69 = 2,848.3

0.62 × 40.69 ≈ 25.23

Adding them together: 2,848.3 + 25.23 ≈ 2,873.53.

Wait, so that would make V approximately $2,873.53.

Looking at the options, E is $2,875, which is close to this estimate. So that might be the correct answer.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculation because approximations can sometimes lead me astray.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Let me try to compute 70.62 ÷ 0.0245632 exactly.

First, let's set this up as:

70.62 ÷ 0.0245632 = ?

I can move the decimal to make it easier. Multiply numerator and denominator by 100,000 to eliminate decimals:

70.62 * 100,000 = 7,062,000

0.0245632 * 100,000 = 2,456.32

So now, it's 7,062,000 ÷ 2,456.32 ≈ ?

Hmm, that's a big number, but maybe I can find how many times 2,456.32 fits into 7,062,000.

Alternatively, I can simplify both numbers by dividing numerator and denominator by something, but perhaps it's easier to compute step by step.

Let me try to compute 2,456.32 × 2,875 = ?

Wait, 2,456.32 × 2,875. Let me see:

First, 2,456.32 × 2,000 = 4,912,640

2,456.32 × 800 = 1,965,056

2,456.32 × 75 = ?

2,456.32 × 70 = 171,942.4

2,456.32 × 5 = 12,281.6

So 171,942.4 + 12,281.6 = 184,224

Adding all together: 4,912,640 + 1,965,056 = 6,877,696 + 184,224 = 7,061,920.

Wait, that's very close to 7,062,000. Because 7,061,920 is 80 less than 7,062,000.

So 2,456.32 × 2,875 = 7,061,920, which is almost 7,062,000. So 7,062,000 ÷ 2,456.32 ≈ 2,875.008.

So V ≈ $2,875, which is option E.

Wait, but earlier I thought the answer was E, which is $2,875.

But let me check the options again because sometimes the options might be different.

Wait, the options are:

A: 3,000

B: 3,150

C: 3,250

D: 3,500

E: 2,875

F: 2,500

G: 2,750

H: 2,600

I: 2,950

J: 3,100

So yes, E is 2,875, which matches our calculation.

Wait, but let me cross-verify. If the assessed value is $2,875, then the property tax is 2.432% of that.

So, 2,875 × 0.02432 = ?

Let me compute that.

First, 2,875 × 0.02 = 57.5

2,875 × 0.00432 = ?

Well, 2,875 × 0.004 = 11.5

2,875 × 0.00032 = 0.919999... approximately 0.92

So adding up: 11.5 + 0.92 = 12.42

So total tax is 57.5 + 12.42 = 69.92

Then the collection fee is 1% of 69.92, which is 0.6992.

So total charge is 69.92 + 0.6992 ≈ 70.6192, which is approximately $70.62.

Yes, that matches exactly. So the assessed valuation is $2,875, which is option E.
