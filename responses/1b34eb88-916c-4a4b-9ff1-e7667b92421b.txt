Question:

A law school advertised in various law journals for a legal ethics and jurisprudence professor. Although a number of lawyers applied for the position, one of the applicants submitted a particularly impressive resume. The dean of faculty for the law school immediately wrote to the applicant to offer him the position. In the letter, the dean offered to employ the applicant for the upcoming academic year, which started on August 15, at a salary of $75,000. The letter also listed the employment terms and conditions, one of which stated that professors are entitled to five paid sick days during the year. The dean included a detailed employment contract containing all these terms, for the applicant's signature. After the applicant received this letter, he replied by mail, requesting a salary of $85,000 and sick leave of 10 days. Upon receipt of the applicant's letter, the dean telephoned the applicant and told him that the law school followed the American Bar Association guidelines with respect to salary and sick leave for its professors. The applicant acquiesced on the salary question, but insisted that his sick leave be extended to 10 days. The dean replied, "Let's not permit a minor issue to stand in the way of your coming to teach at our law school. In the event you require more than 5 sick days, I promise that the matter will be taken care of to your benefit. " The applicant informed the dean that he would sign the contract and forward it to the dean, which he promptly did. The applicant began teaching at the law school on August 15. Three months later, the applicant was out sick for five days with laryngitis. The applicant did not miss another school day until Monday, March 8, when he fell ill with food poisoning. This illness kept him home for five additional sick days. The applicant returned to work on March 15. When the applicant received his salary check at the end of the week, his check did not include payment for the previous week (from March 8 to March 12). Accompanying the check was a statement that read:"Salary payment for period from Monday, March 1 through Friday, March 19 with pro rata deduction to reflect five teaching days missed during said period. "When the applicant received his check, he immediately confronted the dean and requested full payment for the week of March 8 through 12. The dean responded, "I'm sorry, but there is absolutely nothing I can do about it. "The applicant asserted a claim against the law school for breach of contract. The applicant offers to introduce evidence that during his telephone conversation with dean of faculty, the dean promised, if necessary, to provide him with additional sick days. The most accurate statement concerning the dean's oral promise would be that

Options:

A: parol evidence is admissible to show that the parties assented to their written contract only as a partial integration of their complete contract.
B: parol evidence is admissible to prove the written contract was a mistake.
C: parol evidence is admissible to show the dean's personal guarantee of additional sick days.
D: parol evidence is admissible to show that the written contract was void due to lack of consideration.
E: parol evidence is inadmissible to prove any oral agreements made prior to the signing of the written contract.
F: parol evidence is admissible to show that the applicant misunderstood the terms of the contract.
G: parol evidence is admissible to prove the dean coerced the applicant into signing the contract.
H: parol evidence is admissible to show that the written contract is not enforceable, because of undue influence or fraud.
I: parol evidence is inadmissible to prove contemporaneous oral agreements that vary or contradict the terms of a written contract.

Alright, so I'm trying to figure out this law school contract question. Let me read through it carefully.

So, the situation is about a law school hiring a professor. The dean offered a salary and some sick days. The applicant asked for more sick days, and the dean responded by promising to handle it if needed. They signed the contract, and then later, when the applicant used his sick days, the school didn't pay him for those days beyond the 5 provided. Now, he's suing, and he wants to introduce evidence of the dean's oral promise about more sick days.

The question is about whether parol evidence is admissible to prove that oral promise. The options are from A to I, each giving a different reason.

First, I need to remember the rules about parol evidence. The main thing is the Parol Evidence Rule, which governs when prior or contemporaneous agreements can be admitted to contradict a written contract.

Under the UCC (which applies to contracts in general, unless it's a sale of goods, which this isn't), a written contract that is deemed to be a complete integration (meaning it's intended as the final and exclusive statement of the terms) can't have prior or contemporaneous agreements introduced to contradict it. But there are exceptions.

In this case, the contract was a written employment agreement. The applicant is trying to use an oral promise from the dean to show that the written contract's terms about sick days were different or that there was an additional promise.

So, the key here is whether the oral promise is considered a contemporaneous oral agreement that varies the written contract. If the written contract was intended to be a complete integration, then parol evidence can't be used to contradict it unless one of the exceptions applies.

The exceptions to the Parol Evidence Rule include:

1. To explain an ambiguity in the written contract.
2. To show that a term was agreed upon that wasn't included in the writing.
3. To show that there was a mistake in the written contract.
4. To show that consideration was lacking or that there was inducement by fraud, duress, or undue influence.

In this scenario, the written contract included the terms, and the oral promise was made contemporaneously (during the same phone call when the dean responded to the applicant's request). So the oral promise was made at the same time as the written contract was being negotiated and signed.

The applicant argues that the oral promise should be admissible to show that the written contract was not the entire agreement. But under the Parol Evidence Rule, if the written contract is a complete integration, contemporaneous oral agreements can't typically be used to vary its terms unless an exception applies.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Parol evidence is admissible to show the written contract was only a partial integration. Hmm, this suggests that there were additional terms outside the written agreement. But under the Parol Evidence Rule, if the written contract is a complete integration, prior or contemporaneous agreements can't add to it. However, if the contract wasn't intended as a complete integration, then parol evidence might be admissible. But the question is whether the contract was a complete integration.

Option B: Proving the written contract was a mistake. If the oral promise shows that the written contract didn't capture the agreed terms, that could be a mistake. But the applicant isn't claiming the contract was a mistake; he's claiming that there was an additional oral promise.

Option C: The dean's personal guarantee. This seems like it's about whether the oral promise can be considered a separate guarantee. But the Parol Evidence Rule is about the terms of the contract, not about guarantees outside the contract. Not sure.

Option D: Void due to lack of consideration. That's more about contract formation, not parol evidence.

Option E: Inadmissible to prove prior oral agreements. This is the general rule when the written contract is a complete integration. But if the oral agreement was contemporaneous, it's about whether it's admissible to vary the written terms.

Option F: Misunderstanding the contract. This might relate to whether the oral promise shows a mutual mistake or unilateral mistake. But the Parol Evidence Rule is about prior agreements, not about mistakes unless it's a mutual mistake leading to a rescission.

Option G: Coerced into signing. This would go to whether the contract is enforceable due to duress, but that's a defense to contract enforcement, not about parol evidence.

Option H: Void due to undue influence or fraud. Again, a defense, not directly about parol evidence.

Option I: Inadmissible to prove contemporaneous oral agreements that contradict the written contract. This seems to state the general rule that if the written contract is a complete integration, then parol evidence can't be used to vary its terms.

Wait, but in the scenario, the applicant is trying to introduce evidence of an oral promise made during the same time as the written contract. So, if the written contract is a complete integration, then parol evidence can't be used to contradict it. However, if the written contract wasn't intended to be a complete integration, then the oral promise could be admissible.

Looking back, the contract was a detailed one, so it's likely intended as a complete integration. Therefore, the oral promise would be inadmissible to vary the written terms unless an exception applies.

But the applicant's argument is that the oral promise was a separate term. So, the question is whether the Parol Evidence Rule bars this.

Under the UCC ยง2-202, which deals with the Parol Evidence Rule, if a contract is in writing and is considered a complete integration, then prior or contemporaneous agreements that contradict it are inadmissible.

However, if the written contract is not a complete integration, then such evidence is admissible.

The problem is whether the contract here was intended as a complete integration. The fact that the applicant signed the contract after negotiating some terms (salary) but not others (sick days) might indicate that the written contract was not intended to be the final word.

But in the phone call, the dean said that the school follows ABA guidelines, and the applicant only acquiesced on salary but insisted on more sick days. The dean then made the oral promise about handling it if needed.

So, the oral promise was made after the written contract was presented, but before signing. So, it's a contemporaneous oral agreement.

In this case, the written contract had five sick days, but the oral promise effectively added more. So, the applicant is trying to introduce this to show that the written contract didn't fully capture the agreement.

But under the Parol Evidence Rule, if the written contract is a complete integration, the oral promise can't be used to vary it. However, if the written contract was not a complete integration, then the oral promise can be admitted.

The question is about the most accurate statement regarding the admissibility.

Looking at the options, option I says: "parol evidence is inadmissible to prove any contemporaneous oral agreements that vary or contradict the terms of a written contract."

This is the general rule. So, unless an exception applies, it's inadmissible.

But wait, the contract was signed after the oral promise was made. So the oral promise was contemporaneous to the written contract. Therefore, under the Parol Evidence Rule, it's inadmissible to vary the written terms.

Alternatively, if the written contract wasn't intended as a complete integration, then it might be admissible. But that's a factual question. The problem states that the contract was a detailed one, which suggests it was intended as a complete integration.

So, under the general rule, the parol evidence is inadmissible. Therefore, option I would be the correct answer, stating that it's inadmissible to prove such contemporaneous oral agreements.

Wait, but looking at option A: "parol evidence is admissible to show that the parties assented to their written contract only as a partial integration of their complete contract."

This suggests that the written contract is only part of the agreement, so parol evidence can be used. But the Parol Evidence Rule would typically prevent that unless the written contract isn't a complete integration.

But the problem is that the written contract is detailed, which implies it was intended to be complete. Therefore, the oral promise is inadmissible.

So, the most accurate statement is that parol evidence is inadmissible to prove any contemporaneous oral agreements that vary the written contract, which is option I.

The question revolves around the admissibility of parol evidence in the context of a written employment contract. The applicant seeks to introduce an oral promise made by the dean regarding additional sick days, which contradicts the written contract. Under the Parol Evidence Rule, if the written contract is deemed a complete integration (i.e., intended as the final and exclusive statement of terms), contemporaneous oral agreements that contradict it are generally inadmissible unless an exception applies.

In this case, the written contract was detailed and likely intended as a complete integration. The oral promise was made contemporaneously and sought to vary the written terms, making it inadmissible under the general rule. Therefore, the most accurate statement is that parol evidence is inadmissible to prove any contemporaneous oral agreements that contradict the written contract.
