Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how much each insurance company paid Adams Manufacturing after their fire loss. The company had a loss of $45,000, and they're insured by two companies: Acme Insurance with a policy of $50,000 and Safe Way Insurance with $30,000.

Hmm, I think the first step is to understand how insurance policies typically work in cases like this. Usually, if the total loss exceeds the coverage of one policy, the other policy might come into play. But wait, in this case, the total loss is $45,000. Acme's policy is $50,000, which is more than the loss, and Safe Way's is $30,000. 

Wait, but how is the loss split between the two policies? I remember something about proportional coverage. If both policies are primary, maybe they each pay a portion based on their policy limits. So the total coverage from both is $50k + $30k = $80k. But the loss is only $45k, which is less than the combined total. 

So perhaps each company pays a proportion of the loss based on their policy relative to the total available coverage. Let me calculate that. 

Acme's share would be ($50k / $80k) * $45k, and Safe Way's would be ($30k / $80k) * $45k. 

Calculating Acme's payment: (50/80)*45 = (0.625)*45 = $28,125. 

And Safe Way's payment: (30/80)*45 = (0.375)*45 = $16,875. 

Wait, looking at the options, option D says Acme paid $28,125 and Safe Way $16,875. That matches what I just calculated. 

Alternatively, maybe I should check if one policy is primary and the other is excess. But in this case, since the loss is $45k, and Acme's policy is $50k, which covers the entire loss. So perhaps Acme pays the full $45k, and Safe Way doesn't pay anything because the loss is fully covered by Acme. But that doesn't seem right because the options don't have that scenario. 

Wait, but the policies are separate. So maybe each policy covers up to their limit. Since the loss is $45k, and Acme's policy is $50k, which is enough to cover the entire loss. So Acme would pay the full $45k, and Safe Way wouldn't have to pay anything because the loss is already covered by Acme. But looking at the options, I don't see an option where Acme pays $45k and Safe Way pays $0. 

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Perhaps the policies are both covering the same loss, so each covers a portion. So the proportional method is the right approach. Therefore, option D is correct.

The correct answer is determined by calculating each insurance company's proportional share of the loss based on their policy amounts relative to the total coverage. Acme Insurance's share is ($50,000 / $80,000) * $45,000 = $28,125, and Safe Way Insurance's share is ($30,000 / $80,000) * $45,000 = $16,875.
