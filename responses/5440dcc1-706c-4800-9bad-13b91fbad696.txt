Question:

A research project compared the performance of learning disabled and of normal students on ten scales of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children ~ Revised (WISC-R). Ten univariate analyses of variance (ANOVAs) were run to test for differences between the two groups, but use of a multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) would have been more desirable because MANOVA

Options:

A: can account for more variables simultaneously
B: is a more recent development in statistical analysis
C: reduces the need for subsequent regression analysis
D: can handle larger datasets more effectively
E: usually offers greater protection against Type Il error
F: requires less computational power
G: usually offers greater protection against a Type I error
H: allows for more detailed individual participant analysis
I: is conceptually and computationally a simpler and more efficient approach

Answer:

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about MANOVA versus ANOVA, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the question is about why a MANOVA would be more desirable than using ten separate ANOVAs when comparing two groups on ten scales of the WISC-R. The key here is understanding what MANOVA does compared to ANOVA.

I remember that ANOVA is used to compare means between groups on a single dependent variable. So if they ran ten ANOVAs, each one would test a different scale. But doing multiple ANOVAs increases the risk of Type I errors because each test has its own chance of incorrectly rejecting the null hypothesis. Type I error is when you say there's a difference when there isn't one.

Now, MANOVA stands for Multivariate Analysis of Variance. It's used when there are multiple dependent variables. Instead of doing multiple ANOVAs, MANOVA looks at all the variables together. I think one of the main advantages of MANOVA is that it controls for the inflation of Type I errors that comes from multiple comparisons. So it's more protective against that, which would make it better in this scenario where they have ten scales.

Looking at the options:

A: Can account for more variables simultaneously. Well, MANOVA does handle multiple variables, but the question is about why MANOVA is better here. While this is true, it might not directly address the main issue of error control.

B: More recent statistical development. I don't think the age of the method is the main reason for choosing MANOVA here.

C: Reduces need for subsequent regression. Not sure about that. MANOVA and regression are different techniques, but I'm not certain this is the main point.

D: Handles larger datasets. Not directly relevant here since both methods can handle the same data size.

E: Offers greater protection against Type II error. Wait, Type II is about failing to detect a real effect. But when you have multiple ANOVAs, the main issue is Type I, not Type II. So maybe this isn't the right reason.

F: Requires less computational power. I don't think so. In fact, MANOVA might be more complex, so maybe it needs more, not less.

G: Offers greater protection against Type I error. This sounds right because MANOVA adjusts the significance level across multiple dependent variables, reducing the chance of false positives.

H: Allows more detailed individual analysis. MANOVA gives overall tests, not detailed individual results, so probably not.

I: Conceptually simpler. No, MANOVA is more complex than ANOVA because it involves multivariate statistics.

So, the main issue is the increased risk of Type I errors when running multiple ANOVAs. MANOVA addresses this by controlling the overall Type I error rate, making option E or G possible. Wait, waitâ€”option E says Type II, and G says Type I. Since the problem with multiple ANOVAs is Type I inflation, the correct answer should be G.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me double-check. When you do multiple ANOVAs, the alpha level for each test is still 0.05, so the probability of at least one Type I error across ten tests is 1 - (0.95)^10, which is about 40-50%. That's a big risk. MANOVA, on the other hand, tests all variables together, so it maintains the overall alpha level, reducing Type I errors. So the correct reason is that MANOVA offers greater protection against Type I errors, which is option G.

But wait, I thought some sources say that MANOVA can actually increase the power to detect effects, which relates to Type II errors. But in the context of this question, the issue is why MANOVA is better when you have multiple dependent variables. The main advantage is controlling Type I errors when making multiple comparisons.

So the answer should be G: usually offers greater protection against a Type I error.

The correct answer is G. MANOVA is more protective against Type I errors when multiple dependent variables are involved, unlike multiple ANOVAs which increase the risk of false positives.

Answer: G
