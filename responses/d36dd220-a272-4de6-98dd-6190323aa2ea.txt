Okay, so I have this physics problem here about spaceships and velocities. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but I'll give it a shot.

The problem says: A spaceship is moving away from Earth at velocity v1 = 0.75c. Then it launches a rocket in the same direction, and the rocket's velocity relative to the spaceship is v2 = 0.75c. I need to find the rocket's velocity relative to Earth. The options are from A to J, some of which are above the speed of light, which I know isn't possible, so I can probably eliminate those right away.

Wait, but according to Einstein's theory of relativity, velocities don't just add up linearly. You can't just say 0.75c plus another 0.75c because that would give 1.5c, which is impossible. So the correct way is to use the velocity addition formula from special relativity.

I remember the formula is something like (v1 + v2) divided by (1 + (v1*v2)/c²). Let me write that down correctly. So the formula is u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u'v)/c²), where u' is the velocity of the rocket relative to the spaceship, and v is the spaceship's velocity relative to Earth. So u is the velocity we're trying to find.

Wait, let me make sure I have the variables right. In this case, the spaceship is moving at v = 0.75c away from Earth. The rocket is moving at u' = 0.75c relative to the spaceship, also in the same direction. So we're adding those velocities in the same direction, so the signs should be positive.

Plugging in the numbers: u = (0.75c + 0.75c) / (1 + (0.75c * 0.75c)/c²).

Let me compute the numerator first: 0.75 + 0.75 is 1.5, so 1.5c.

The denominator: 1 + (0.75 * 0.75) c² / c². The c² cancels out, so it's 1 + 0.5625, which is 1.5625.

So u = (1.5c) / 1.5625. Let me compute that division.

1.5 divided by 1.5625. Hmm, 1.5625 is 25/16, because 1.5625 = 25 ÷ 16. Wait, 16 * 1.5625 = 25? Let me check:

16 * 1.5625 = 16*(1 + 0.5 + 0.0625) = 16*1=16, 16*0.5=8, 16*0.0625=1. So 16+8+1=25. Yes, so 1.5625 = 25/16.

So 1.5 is 3/2. So (3/2) divided by (25/16) is (3/2) * (16/25) = (3*16)/(2*25) = 48/50 = 0.96.

So u = 0.96c.

Wait, that's one of the options. Let me check the options again. Option I is 0.96c. So that's the answer.

But wait, let me think again. Are there any other considerations, like direction? Both velocities are in the same direction, so adding them as positive makes sense. Also, according to the formula, when you're adding velocities in the same direction, the result is less than c, which is what we got here (0.96c < c), so that makes sense.

Just to make sure, maybe I can cross-verify. Suppose v = 0.8c and u' = 0.8c. Then u would be (0.8 + 0.8)/(1 + 0.64) = 1.6 / 1.64 ≈ 0.9756c, which is less than c. So the formula works.

In our case, 0.75 and 0.75 gives 0.96c, which is under c, so it's valid.

The velocity of the rocket relative to Earth is calculated using the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
u = \frac{u' + v}{1 + \frac{u'v}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \( v = 0.75c \) (spaceship's velocity relative to Earth) and \( u' = 0.75c \) (rocket's velocity relative to the spaceship). Substituting these values:

\[
u = \frac{0.75c + 0.75c}{1 + \frac{(0.75c)(0.75c)}{c^2}}
\]

Simplify the numerator:

\[
0.75c + 0.75c = 1.5c
\]

Simplify the denominator:

\[
1 + \frac{0.5625c^2}{c^2} = 1 + 0.5625 = 1.5625
\]

Now divide:

\[
u = \frac{1.5c}{1.5625} = 0.96c
\]

This result is consistent with relativistic principles and matches option I.
