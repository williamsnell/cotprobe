Alright, so I'm trying to figure out which activity is NOT commonly mentioned by retired people. Let's see, the options are A through J. I need to go through each one and think about whether they're typical for retirees.

Starting with A: Starting a new business. I'm not sure, but maybe some retirees do start businesses, maybe as a new venture after retirement. But I'm not certain how common that is.

B: Working part-time. I think a lot of retirees do this. They might take on part-time jobs for the income or to stay active. So B is probably a common activity.

C: Mountain climbing. That seems like an adventurous activity. I'm not sure if many retirees take up mountain climbing. It might be more for younger people, but maybe some do. I'll need to think more about this.

D: Household chores. Well, of course, people still need to do chores whether they're retired or not. So D is likely a common activity.

E: Travel. Definitely, many retirees travel more after retiring because they have the time. So E is common.

F: Writing a book. This could be a hobby, but I'm not sure how many retirees actually write a book. It might be a less common activity compared to others.

G: Redoing the home. Maybe retirees have more time to renovate or redecorate their homes. So G is probably common.

H: DJing at local clubs. This seems unusual. DJing is something that's more associated with younger people, especially in nightclubs. I don't think many retirees take up DJing as a regular activity. So H might be the answer.

I: Attending educational courses. Retirees often pursue new interests or education, so I is likely common.

J: Volunteering. Definitely, many retirees volunteer, as it's a common way to stay active and give back.

So, putting this together. The options that seem less common are A, F, and H. But the question is asking which is NOT one of the more frequently named activities. I think starting a business (A) might be less common than, say, writing a book (F). But DJing (H) seems the least likely because it's more of a young person's activity. So I think H is the answer.
