Question:

Rainbow Corporation has outstanding 1,000 shares of voting common stock and 1,000 shares of nonvoting preferred. The preferred has a liquidation preference equal to its par value of $100 per share plus a 3 percent noncumulative dividend. Rainbow submits to its stockholders a proposal to authorize a new class of preferred stock with redemption rights that would come ahead of the old preferred stock. At a shareholders' meeting, 700 common and 400 preferred vote in favor of the proposal. Which of the following statements is correct?

Options:

A: The proposal is invalidly approved because a unanimous vote from both classes is required.
B: The proposal is validly approved because the nonvoting preferred stock does not count towards the vote.
C: The proposal is invalidly approved because a two-thirds vote of each class is required.
D: The vote of the preferred stockholders does not matter because it was nonvoting stock.
E: The proposal is validly approved because the common shareholders have the majority vote.
F: The vote of the preferred stockholders does not matter because the proposal affects the common stock.
G: The proposal is validly approved because the preferred stockholders who voted in favor have a liquidation preference.
H: The proposal is invalidly approved because a majority of the outstanding shares did not approve.
I: The proposal is invalidly approved because a majority of the preferred shareholders did not approve.
J: The proposal is validly approved because overall a majority of the outstanding shares did approve.

Okay, so I have this question about corporate law, specifically dealing with stockholder voting on preferred stock proposals. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The company is Rainbow Corporation. They have two types of stock: voting common stock and nonvoting preferred stock. There are 1,000 shares of each. So, the common stock is voting, meaning the holders can participate in decisions like this proposal. The preferred stock is nonvoting, so their holders don't get to vote on such matters. 

The proposal is about authorizing a new class of preferred stock with redemption rights that come ahead of the existing old preferred stock. So, the new preferred would have priority over the old preferred in terms of redemption. That's important because in liquidation or redemption scenarios, the order matters a lot.

At the shareholders' meeting, 700 common and 400 preferred voted in favor. Wait, but the preferred stock is nonvoting. So, does that mean the preferred shareholders don't get to vote, and their votes don't count? Or is it that they can't vote because their shares are nonvoting? I think it's the latter. Nonvoting preferreds don't have voting rights, so their votes wouldn't count. So, the only votes that matter are from the common stockholders.

Wait, but the question says 400 preferred voted in favor. But since they're nonvoting, their votes don't count towards the proposal's approval. So the total votes in favor would only be from the common stockholders. How many common shares are there? 1,000. And 700 voted in favor. So 700 out of 1,000 common shares. That's a 70% approval from the common stock.

Now, the question is about whether the proposal was validly approved. So, what are the requirements for such a proposal? Typically, amendments to the corporate charter or authorizing new classes of stock can require majority votes or sometimes supermajorities. But the key here is how the company's charter is structured. But since the question doesn't specify any particular voting thresholds beyond what's usual, I'll assume the default rules apply.

But wait, another angle: when a corporation is proposing to issue new preferred stock with rights that could affect existing preferred or common shareholders, there are certain legal requirements. For example, prior rights of existing preferred stock must be protected unless certain conditions are met. But in this case, the new preferred has redemption rights that come ahead of the old preferred. That might require the consent of the existing preferred stockholders, but since the existing preferred is nonvoting, they can't consent through a vote. Hmm, but the proposal was approved by the common stockholders. 

Wait, but the existing preferred is nonvoting. So, if the proposal affects their rights, their consent might be required, but they can't vote. So, maybe the proposal needs to be approved by the existing preferred stockholders, but since they can't vote, it's impossible. But that doesn't seem to be the case here because the question says the proposal is submitted to the stockholders, and the common and some preferred voted. But the preferred's votes don't count. 

Alternatively, maybe the proposal only needs the approval of the common stockholders since the preferred can't vote. Let's think about what the options say.

Looking at the options:

A: Invalid because both classes need unanimous vote. Not sure, but I don't think that's the case. Typically, for amendments affecting preferred, you might need consent from preferred, but if they're nonvoting, that's tricky.

B: Valid because nonvoting preferred don't count. So the common's vote suffices. That seems plausible.

C: Invalid because each class needs 2/3. Not sure about that; the question doesn't specify a 2/3 requirement.

D: Preferred's vote doesn't matter because they're nonvoting. So their votes don't count. That's correct, but the overall question is whether the proposal is approved.

E: Valid because common has majority. Since 700/1000 is 70%, which is a majority. So yes, the common's approval is enough.

F: Preferred's vote doesn't matter because the proposal affects common. Not sure about thatâ€”maybe not relevant.

G: Preferred who voted in favor have liquidation preference. Not sure how that matters here.

H: Invalid because majority of all shares didn't approve. Total shares are 2000 (1000 common + 1000 preferred). If only 700 common voted yes, that's 350 out of 2000, which is only 17.5%. So majority (50%) isn't met if considering all shares.

I: Invalid because a majority of preferred didn't approve. But preferred can't vote, so their approval isn't considered.

J: Valid because overall majority of shares approved. But if preferred don't count, then 700 out of 1000 common is 70%, which is majority of the common class, but does the overall majority of all shares matter? If the proposal requires majority of all shares, then 700 is 35% of total 2000, which isn't a majority. But if the proposal only needs majority of the voting shares, which are common, then 70% is enough.

Wait, but the question is about the proposal being approved. So, if the proposal is presented to all stockholders, and only the common can vote, then 700 out of 1000 is a majority of the common, which might be sufficient. So the proposal is approved because the common shareholders who can vote, did so by majority.

But let me think about the structure. The company is proposing a new class of preferred stock. Since the existing preferred is nonvoting, they don't get to vote on this. So the proposal would need approval by the common stockholders. The common stock has 1,000 shares, and 700 voted in favor. That's a majority, so the proposal passes.

So looking at the options, E says "the proposal is validly approved because the common shareholders have the majority vote." That seems correct.

But let me check other options. Option B says it's valid because the nonvoting preferred don't count. That's also correct in a way, because their votes don't count. So the common's majority suffices.

But the question is whether the proposal is validly approved. So, if the common have a majority, the proposal passes because they're the only ones who can vote. So E and B could both seem correct.

Wait, but in some cases, when a proposal affects a particular class, you might need the approval of that class. But in this case, the new preferred has redemption rights ahead of the old preferred. Since the old preferred is nonvoting, they can't vote against it. So does that mean the proposal can't be approved because it affects their rights without their consent? But the preferred are nonvoting, so they can't consent. So perhaps the proposal requires the approval of the existing preferred, but since they can't vote, the proposal is invalid.

Wait, that's another angle. The proposal affects the existing preferred stockholders by subordinating their redemption rights. Under corporate law, when you issue new shares that have senior rights over existing ones, you may need the consent of the existing shareholders whose rights are being affected. But if they can't vote, can their consent be obtained? Probably not. So the proposal might be invalid because it impairs the rights of existing preferred without their consent.

But the question says the proposal was made, and 700 common and 400 preferred voted in favor. But since the preferred can't vote, their votes don't count. So the 700 common are 70% of the common, which is a majority. So the proposal passes because the common approved it, despite the fact that the preferred's rights are being altered without their vote.

But wait, the existing preferred are nonvoting. So they can't vote, but their rights are being subordinated. Does that require a vote? Or is it allowed because they can't vote, but the common, who have control, approve it.

I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.

Under the law, when a company wants to amend its charter to issue new shares that have rights superior to existing shares, it may need the consent of the affected existing shareholders. For example, if you have existing preferred with certain rights, and you want to issue new preferred that is senior, you might need the consent of the existing preferred. But if those existing preferred are nonvoting, they can't give their consent via a vote. So the company can't get their consent, which would make the proposal invalid.

But in this case, the proposal was submitted to the stockholders, and the common stock voted in favor. The preferred couldn't vote. So, if the proposal affects the existing preferred, and you need their consent but can't get it, then the proposal is invalid.

Wait, but the question says the proposal was submitted to the stockholders. So perhaps the company is asking for the approval of the stockholders, and since the common stock has a majority, the proposal passes. But the existing preferred's rights are being affected, but since they can't vote, their consent isn't obtained, which might make the proposal invalid.

Alternatively, perhaps the proposal only needs the approval of the common stock, as they're the only ones with voting rights. So the fact that the proposal affects the preferred doesn't matter because the preferred can't vote, and the common have approved it.

I'm a bit torn between these two possibilities. Let's look at the options.

Option I says the proposal is invalidly approved because a majority of preferred didn't approve. But the preferred can't vote, so their approval isn't required. So I think that's incorrect.

Option H says the proposal is invalid because a majority of all shares didn't approve. 700 is 35% of 2000, which is less than a majority. So if the proposal requires majority of all shares, then it's invalid. But I'm not sure if such a proposal needs overall majority or just the voting class.

In many cases, amendments to the corporate charter require the approval of a majority of the outstanding shares. But when dealing with different classes, sometimes each class must approve. But in this case, the existing preferred are nonvoting, so they can't approve. So the proposal needs the approval of the common stock, which it has, but if it's presented as an overall majority, then it's invalid.

Wait, but the question is about whether the proposal is validly approved. So if the proposal requires majority approval of all shares, then 700 is not enough. But if it only requires approval of the common stock, then it's sufficient.

I think the key is that the existing preferred are nonvoting, so their consent isn't required. Therefore, the common's approval is sufficient, making the proposal valid. So option E is correct.

Alternatively, looking at option J: the proposal is valid because a majority of all shares approved. But 700 is only 35% of 2000, so that's not a majority. So J is incorrect.

So, based on this, the correct answer is E: the proposal is validly approved because the common shareholders have the majority vote.
</think>

The Rainbow Corporation proposal involves issuing a new class of preferred stock with redemption rights senior to existing preferred stock. The company has 1,000 voting common shares and 1,000 nonvoting preferred shares. At the meeting, 700 common and 400 preferred shares voted in favor, but since the preferred shares are nonvoting, only the common shareholders' votes count. 

The common shareholders approved the proposal by a 70% majority (700 out of 1,000). Nonvoting preferred shareholders cannot consent to such changes, but their votes are irrelevant. The proposal does not require the approval of all shares or a supermajority, as the question does not specify such thresholds. Therefore, the proposal is validly approved by the common shareholders' majority vote.
