Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The question says that a chemist performs a neutralization reaction. She uses 1 gram of C6H10C4, which is an acid, and it requires 0.768 grams of KOH for complete neutralization. I need to determine the number of neutralizable protons in this molecule. The options are from A to J, with numbers ranging from zero to nine.

Hmm, neutralization reaction... That usually involves an acid reacting with a base to produce a salt and water. In this case, the acid is C6H10C4, and the base is KOH. So, the reaction would look something like:

C6H10C4 + KOH → Salt + H2O

Wait, but I'm not sure about the formula. Let me think. Acids are usually proton donors, so neutralizable protons would be the acidic protons in the molecule. For example, in a carboxylic acid, there are two acidic protons (the -OH in the COOH group), but only the first one is easily neutralizable. Or wait, maybe it's different. Let me get that straight.

Wait, no, in neutralization, each H+ from the acid reacts with OH- from the base. So the number of moles of H+ from the acid equals the moles of OH- from the KOH.

So, to find the number of neutralizable protons, I need to find the ratio of moles of acid to moles of KOH used.

First, I should calculate the molar masses to find the number of moles for each.

The acid is C6H10C4. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, wait, maybe it's a typo. Oh wait, perhaps it's C6H10O4? Because C6H10C4 doesn't make much sense; maybe it's an acid like citric acid, which is C6H8O6, but maybe the formula is different here. Alternatively, maybe it's C6H10O4, which would make sense as a diacid or something.

Wait, maybe I should just go by the given formula. So, the formula is C6H10C4. Wait, that's 6 C, 10 H, and 4 C? That adds up to 10 C, 10 H. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, perhaps it's a typo. Maybe it's C6H10O4. Because otherwise, the formula is C10H10, which is a molecule with 10 carbons and 10 hydrogens. But that doesn't seem like an acid. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the formula is correct as given, but that would be C6H10C4, which would be C10H10. Wait, that's possible, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's something else. Wait, but maybe I should proceed without worrying about that for now.

Wait, the problem says it's an acid, so it must have acidic protons. Let's proceed.

So, first, find the molar masses.

Molar mass of C6H10C4: Wait, 6 C, 10 H, and 4 C? That can't be right. Wait, no, I think I'm miscounting. Wait, the formula is C6H10C4, which is C6 + C4 = C10, so C10H10? So, carbon is 12 g/mol, hydrogen is 1 g/mol.

So molar mass of acid (C10H10) is (10 × 12) + (10 × 1) = 120 + 10 = 130 g/mol.

Wait, but that seems high, but let's go with it. So 1 gram of the acid is 1 g / 130 g/mol ≈ 0.007692 moles.

Now, KOH has a molar mass of K: 39, O:16, H:1. So 39 +16 +1 = 56 g/mol.

The mass of KOH used is 0.768 grams, so moles of KOH = 0.768 g /56 g/mol ≈ 0.013714 moles.

In a neutralization reaction, the acid (HnA) would react with KOH (a base) as follows:

HnA + KOH → K salt + H2O

Each mole of HnA would react with n moles of KOH, where n is the number of acidic protons (neutralizable protons).

So, the stoichiometry would be:

moles of acid × n = moles of KOH.

So, n = moles of KOH / moles of acid.

So, n = 0.013714 / 0.007692 ≈ 1.782.

Wait, but n should be an integer because it's the number of protons. So 1.782 is approximately 1.8, which is close to 2. Hmm, but that's a bit off. Maybe I made a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps I should recalculate the moles more accurately.

Molar mass of acid: C10H10 → 10×12=120, 10×1=10 → 130 g/mol.

Moles of acid = 1g /130 g/mol ≈ 0.0076923.

Molar mass of KOH: 56 g/mol.

Moles of KOH = 0.768 /56 = 0.0137143.

So, n = 0.0137143 / 0.0076923 ≈ 1.782.

Hmm, that's approximately 1.78, which is close to 1.8. That's not an integer, which is a problem because n should be an integer.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the molar mass of the acid. Let me check again. The formula given is C6H10C4. Wait, that's C6 plus C4, making it C10, and H10. So yes, C10H10, which is 10×12 +10×1 =130 g/mol.

Wait, perhaps the formula isn't C10H10. Maybe it's C6H10O4, as I thought earlier. Because C6H10O4 would be something like citric acid, which has three acidic protons. Let me calculate that.

C6H10O4: 6×12=72, 10×1=10, 4×16=64. Total: 72+10+64=146 g/mol.

Moles of acid: 1g /146 ≈ 0.0068493 moles.

Moles of KOH: 0.768 /56 ≈ 0.0137143.

n = 0.0137143 /0.0068493 ≈2.0005. Oh, that's approximately 2. So n=2.

Wait, that makes more sense. So if the formula is C6H10O4, which is, for example, a diprotic acid like maleic acid or something similar, then n=2. So the number of neutralizable protons is 2.

But wait, the problem states the formula as C6H10C4, which I'm now thinking might be a typo. Maybe it's C6H10O4. Alternatively, perhaps it's something else.

But given that, perhaps the correct number is 2. So the answer would be option C: two.

Wait, but the original formula given in the problem is C6H10C4, which doesn't include oxygen. So maybe it's a different kind of acid. Let's think again.

If the formula is C6H10C4, which is C10H10, then the molar mass is 130 g/mol. Then moles of acid is 1/130 ≈0.007692.

Moles of KOH: 0.768 /56 ≈0.013714.

n=0.013714 /0.007692 ≈1.782, which is approximately 1.78. That's not an integer, which suggests perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula is C6H10O2, which is another possibility. Let's see.

C6H10O2: 6×12=72, 10×1=10, 2×16=32. Total=72+10+32=114 g/mol.

Moles of acid: 1/114 ≈0.0087719.

Moles of KOH: 0.768/56=0.013714.

n=0.013714/0.0087719≈1.563. Still not integer.

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the formula is C6H10O6, like glucose, but that's not an acid. Alternatively, C6H5COOH is benzoic acid, which is C7H6O2. But that's 7 carbons, not 6.

Wait, perhaps the formula is C6H10O4, which is 146 g/mol. Then, as I calculated earlier, n≈2.0005.

So that would give n=2, which is option C.

But the problem states the formula as C6H10C4, which is C10H10, so maybe I need to reevaluate.

Alternatively, perhaps the acid is a diacid, with two acidic protons. So, in that case, each mole of acid would react with two moles of KOH.

Wait, but according to the calculation, when the formula is C10H10, the n comes out to about 1.78, which is not an integer. That can't be right, because the number of neutralizable protons must be a whole number.

So perhaps the formula is actually C6H10O4, which would give n=2, making the answer option C: two.

Alternatively, maybe the formula is correct as C6H10C4, which would be C10H10. Let's try to think of a molecule like that. Maybe it's a hydrocarbon with 10 carbons and 10 hydrogens. But that's an alkane or something else. Wait, but that's not an acid. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the formula is a typo, and it's supposed to be C6H10O4, which would make sense as a diacid, like maleic acid (which is C4H4O4), but that's another thing.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a monoacid, but then n would be 1. Let's see.

If n=1, then moles of KOH should equal moles of acid.

So, with the acid being C10H10 (molar mass 130), 1g is 0.007692 moles.

If n=1, then moles of KOH would be 0.007692, which would require KOH mass of 0.007692 ×56 ≈0.430 grams. But the problem says 0.768 grams of KOH are used, which is higher than that. So n must be higher than 1.

Wait, let's calculate the exact ratio again.

n = (0.768/56) / (1/130) = (0.768/56) * (130/1) = (0.768 ×130) /56.

0.768 ×130 = let's calculate that.

0.768 ×100=76.8; 0.768 ×30=23.04; total 76.8+23.04=99.84.

So 99.84 /56 ≈1.782.

So n≈1.78, which is approximately 1.78, but that's not an integer.

Hmm, that's a problem because n should be an integer. So perhaps there's a mistake in the problem's data, or perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, maybe I should check the molar masses again.

Wait, for C10H10: 10×12=120, 10×1=10. Sum 130 g/mol. That's correct.

KOH: 39.10 (K) +16.00 (O) +1.008 (H) ≈56.108 g/mol.

So 0.768 /56.108 ≈0.013707 moles.

1g /130 g/mol ≈0.0076923 moles.

n=0.013707 /0.0076923≈1.782.

Hmm, so n≈1.78, which is close to 1.78, but it's not an integer. That's confusing.

Wait, perhaps the acid is triprotic, and n=3, but that would mean moles of KOH =3×0.0076923≈0.023077, which would require KOH mass of 0.023077×56≈1.292 grams. But the problem says 0.768 grams, which is less than that.

Alternatively, maybe the acid is diprotic, n=2, which would require 2×0.0076923≈0.0153846 moles of KOH, which would be 0.0153846 ×56≈0.865 grams. But the problem uses 0.768 grams, which is less than that. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the acid is monoprotic, but then the KOH needed would be 0.0076923 ×56≈0.430 grams, which is lower than 0.768 grams. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, but perhaps the acid has more than one acidic proton, but not all are neutralizable. For example, maybe it's a diacid but only one proton is neutralizable. Then n=1. So the ratio would be 1, but then the KOH needed would be 0.430 grams, which is less than what's given.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is designed so that the ratio is approximately 2, leading to option C: two.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me calculate the exact value.

n = (0.768 /56) / (1/130) = (0.768 ×130) /56.

Compute 0.768 ×130:

0.768 ×100 =76.8

0.768 ×30=23.04

Total =76.8 +23.04=99.84.

So, 99.84 /56 = approximately 1.782857.

So n≈1.782857.

Hmm, that's not an integer. So perhaps the formula I'm using is incorrect. Maybe the formula is different.

Wait, perhaps the formula is C6H10O4, as I thought earlier, making the molar mass 146 g/mol.

So, moles of acid=1/146≈0.0068493.

Moles of KOH=0.768/56≈0.013714.

Then n=0.013714/0.0068493≈2.0005.

That gives n≈2, which is an integer. So that makes sense. So the number of neutralizable protons is 2.

Therefore, the answer would be option C: two.
</think>

To determine the number of neutralizable protons in the molecule C₆H₁₀C₄, we analyze the neutralization reaction between the acid and KOH. The reaction is:

\[
\text{C}_6\text{H}_{10}\text{C}_4 + \text{KOH} \rightarrow \text{Salt} + \text{H}_2\text{O}
\]

### Step 1: Molar Masses
- **Molar mass of C₆H₁₀C₄ (C₁₀H₁₀):**  
  \( 10 \times 12 + 10 \times 1 = 130 \, \text{g/mol} \)
- **Molar mass of KOH:**  
  \( 39 + 16 + 1 = 56 \, \text{g/mol} \)

### Step 2: Moles of Acid and KOH
- **Moles of acid (C₁₀H₁₀):**  
  \[
  \frac{1 \, \text{g}}{130 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.007692 \, \text{mol}
  \]
- **Moles of KOH:**  
  \[
  \frac{0.768 \, \text{g}}{56 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.013714 \, \text{mol}
  \]

### Step 3: Ratio of Neutralizable Protons
In a neutralization reaction, the number of moles of \( \text{H}^+ \) ions (neutralizable protons) from the acid equals the moles of \( \text{OH}^- \) ions from KOH. Thus:

\[
n = \frac{\text{Moles of KOH}}{\text{Moles of acid}} = \frac{0.013714}{0.007692} \approx 1.78
\]

This result is not an integer, which is unusual since \( n \) should represent the number of neutralizable protons and must be an integer. This discrepancy suggests a possible issue with the given formula \( \text{C}_6\text{H}_{10}\text{C}_4 \), as it does not align with typical acid structures.

### Step 4: Reassessing the Formula
If the formula were \( \text{C}_6\text{H}_{10}\text{O}_4 \) (a plausible acid structure, e.g., maleic acid), the molar mass would be:

\[
6 \times 12 + 10 \times 1 + 4 \times 16 = 146 \, \text{g/mol}
\]

Recomputing the moles:

- **Moles of acid (\( \text{C}_6\text{H}_{10}\text{O}_4 \)):**  
  \[
  \frac{1 \, \text{g}}{146 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.0068493 \, \text{mol}
  \]
- **Moles of KOH:**  
  \[
  \frac{0.768 \, \text{g}}{56 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.013714 \, \text{mol}
  \]

Now, the ratio \( n \) is:

\[
n = \frac{0.013714}{0.0068493} \approx 2.0005
\]

This result is approximately \( 2 \), indicating that the acid has **two neutralizable protons**.

### Conclusion
Given the ambiguity in the original formula, the most plausible interpretation is that the acid has **two neutralizable protons**, corresponding to option C.

**Answer:** C
