Okay, so I've got this economics question here about inelastic demand. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's start by recalling what inelastic demand means. If I remember right, inelastic demand is when the quantity demanded doesn't change much in response to a price change. So, the percentage change in quantity demanded is less than the percentage change in price. That means the price elasticity of demand (PED) is less than 1 in absolute terms.

The formula for PED is the percentage change in quantity demanded divided by the percentage change in price. So, if the price goes up by, say, 5% and the quantity demanded goes down by 3%, the PED would be -3%/5% = -0.6. Since we take the absolute value, that's 0.6, which is less than 1, so demand is inelastic there.

Looking at the options, I need to find which situation shows inelastic demand. Let's go through each one.

Option A: 10% price decrease leads to 20% increase in quantity. So, PED is 20% / (-10%) = -2. Absolute value is 2, which is greater than 1, so elastic. Not inelastic.

Option B: 3% decrease in price, 5% increase in quantity. PED is 5 / (-3) ≈ -1.666. Absolute is 1.666, which is greater than 1. So elastic again.

Option C: 2% price decrease, 5% quantity increase. PED is 5 / (-2) = -2.5. Absolute 2.5, elastic. Not inelastic.

Option D: 4% price increase, 6% decrease in quantity. PED is (-6%) / 4% = -1.5. Absolute is 1.5, which is greater than 1. So elastic again.

Option E: 10% price increase, 15% decrease in quantity. PED is (-15)/10 = -1.5. Absolute 1.5, still elastic.

Option F: 6% price increase, 9% decrease in quantity. PED is (-9)/6 = -1.5. Absolute 1.5, elastic. Hmm, same as D and E.

Option G: 7% price decrease, 10% increase in quantity. PED is 10 / (-7) ≈ -1.428. Absolute 1.428, still elastic.

Option H: 5% price increase, 3% decrease in quantity. PED is (-3)/5 = -0.6. Absolute is 0.6, which is less than 1. So this is inelastic.

Wait, let me double-check. For inelastic, the percentage change in quantity is smaller than the percentage change in price. So, in H, price goes up 5%, quantity down 3%. 3% <5%, so yes, inelastic. All other options have the quantity change percentage higher than the price change, leading to elastic demand. So the correct answer should be H.

The correct answer is H because the percentage change in quantity demanded (3%) is smaller than the percentage change in price (5%), indicating inelastic demand.
