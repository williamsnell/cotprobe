Okay, so I need to figure out who the archenemy of Underdog is from the given options. I'm not super familiar with Underdog, but I know he's a cartoon superhero. Let me think about what I remember.

First, Underdog is a character I've heard about, maybe from old cartoons. His main enemy should be someone significant in that show. Let me go through the options one by one.

Option A: Shredder. I know Shredder is from Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. He's their main antagonist, so probably not Underdog's enemy.

Option B: Captain Hook. That's from Peter Pan. He's more of a Disney character, not related to Underdog.

Option C: Dick Dastardly. Hmm, Dick Dastardly is from the animated series "The Road Rovers." He's a villain there, but I don't think he's connected to Underdog.

Option D: Dr. Doom. Dr. Doom is a Marvel villain, from the Fantastic Four. Doesn't seem related to Underdog.

Option E: OverCat. I'm not too sure about this one. OverCat rings a bell, but I'm not certain. Maybe a lesser-known villain?

Option F: Riddler. The Riddler is from Batman. He's a Gotham villain, so probably not Underdog's enemy.

Option G: Mr. Whoopie. Wait, I think Mr. Whoopie is a character from the Underdog series. He's a dog-like character, maybe a friend or a minor villain? Or perhaps a different show.

Option H: Muttley. Muttley is from the "Looney Tunes" series, a dog character, but again, not sure about Underdog's enemies.

Option I: Lex Luthor. Lex Luthor is Superman's main enemy. Not related to Underdog.

Option J: Joker. The Joker is Batman's archenemy. Definitely not Underdog's.

Wait, I think I might be mixing up some characters. Let me think again. Underdog's main antagonist is someone named Simon Bar Sinister. But wait, looking at the options, I don't see Simon Bar Sinister listed. So maybe one of these is correct.

Wait, perhaps I'm mistaken. Maybe one of these options is actually another name or a different version. Let me think about the options again.

Option E is OverCat. I think that's correct because I remember OverCat being Underdog's main enemy. He's a cat with superpowers, I believe. So OverCat would be Underdog's archenemy.

Wait, but another thought: sometimes in these questions, the options might include a character that's similar but not exactly the same. So, is OverCat indeed the correct answer?

I think yes. So the answer should be E: OverCat.

The answer is E: OverCat.
