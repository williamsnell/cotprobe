Okay, so I've got this psychology question in front of me, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let me read it again: "A person who is low in self-monitoring (Snyder, 1987) will rely on which of the following when deciding how to act in a particular social situation?" The options are from A to J. Hmm.

First, I should remember what self-monitoring means. From what I recall, self-monitoring is a concept introduced by Mark Snyder. People high in self-monitoring are those who are very aware of their public image, how others perceive them, and they adjust their behavior accordingly. They're more likely to adapt their actions based on the situation and others' expectations. On the flip side, people low in self-monitoring aren't as focused on others' opinions. They tend to rely more on their internal states rather than external cues.

So the question is asking, if someone is low in self-monitoring, what do they use to decide their actions in a social situation? Let's go through the options one by one.

Option A: His/her life scripts. Life scripts are like the stories or schemas we have about how life should be. I'm not sure if that's directly related to self-monitoring, but maybe it's a possible option.

Option B: Past experiences in similar situations. That seems more about personal history and might relate to how people generally make decisions, not specifically about self-monitoring.

Option C: The advice of friends or family. That's about seeking external input, which might not be the case for low self-monitors since they focus less on others.

Option D: Random decision making. Hmm, that doesn't sound right. People usually have some basis for their decisions, even if they're low in self-monitoring.

Option E: Societal norms and expectations. High self-monitors would pay attention to these because they're concerned with how others see them, but low self-monitors might not rely on this as much.

Option F: Internal working models that were acquired during infancy and early childhood. These are like attachment styles or core beliefs, which are internal. Low self-monitors might rely more on these internal models, so this could be a contender.

Option G: Popular trends or fads. Again, that's more about external expectations and might not be what low self-monitors focus on.

Option H: The emotional reactions and behaviors of the people he/she is interacting with. High self-monitors would be more attuned to this, as they're monitoring others' reactions. Low self-monitors might not pay as much attention, so maybe not this.

Option I: The expectations of authority figures. Similar to societal norms, this is an external cue, so probably not the main focus for low self-monitors.

Option J: His/her own feelings, attitudes, and beliefs. This makes sense because low self-monitors are more introspective and rely on their internal feelings rather than external cues.

Wait, but option F also talks about internal models from early childhood. So I'm a bit confused. Are internal working models the same as self-monitoring? Or is it more about how they process information?

I think self-monitoring is about whether someone looks at themselves and others when deciding behavior. Low self-monitors don't pay as much attention to others, so they go with their own internal feelings and beliefs. That points more towards option J.

So putting it together, the answer should be J: his/her own feelings, attitudes, and beliefs.

The correct answer is J: his/her own feelings, attitudes, and beliefs. Low self-monitors rely on their internal states rather than external cues when deciding how to act.

Answer: J
