Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the U.S. House of Representatives, and I need to figure out which statement is true. Let's go through each option one by one.

Option A says, "All revenue bills must originate in the Senate before moving to the House." Hmm, I remember something about the Origination Clause in the U.S. Constitution. I think it states that all revenue bills must start in the House, not the Senate. So this statement seems incorrect because it's the opposite of what actually happens. So A is probably false.

Option B claims, "Representation in the House is allocated equally among the states, while representation in the Senate is allocated proportional to population." Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. I recall that each state has two senators, so the Senate is proportionate based on population through the Electoral College, but actually, each state has equal representation in the Senate with two seats each. The House, on the other hand, has varying numbers of representatives per state based on population. So the statement is backwards. The House is proportional, and the Senate is equal per state (each has two). So B is false.

Option C states, "The Speaker of the House wields less power than the president pro tempore of the Senate." I'm not entirely sure about this. The Speaker of the House is a very powerful position, leading the House, controlling the agenda, and being third in line to the presidency. The president pro tempore of the Senate is also a significant role but perhaps not as powerful as the Speaker. Wait, I think the Speaker is more influential. So C is probably false because the Speaker has more power.

Option D says, "The House has a Committee on Ways and Means, while the Senate does not." I remember that the Committee on Ways and Means is indeed a key committee in the House, dealing with taxes and revenue. Does the Senate have a similar committee? I think the Senate's equivalent is the Finance Committee. So the House has Ways and Means, and the Senate doesn't have that exact committee. Therefore, D is true.

So, putting it all together, the correct answer should be D.

The correct answer is D: The House has a Committee on Ways and Means, while the Senate does not.

Answer: D
