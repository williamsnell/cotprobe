Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about calculating the heat required to change ice into steam. Hmm, let me think through this. I remember that when dealing with phase changes, you have to consider both heating the substance and then changing its phase. So, the process here is: first, warming the ice from -10°C to 0°C, then melting the ice into water, and finally heating that water from 0°C to 100°C, and then vaporizing it into steam. Each of these steps requires a different calculation.

Alright, let's break it down step by step. 

First, I need to find the mass of the ice. The problem says 25 kg, which is 25,000 grams. That's a lot, but okay.

The first step is warming the ice from -10°C to 0°C. The formula for this is Q = m * c * ΔT, where c is the specific heat capacity of ice. I recall that the specific heat of ice is about 2.1 J/g°C. So, plugging in the numbers: 25,000 g * 2.1 J/g°C * (0 - (-10))°C. That's 25,000 * 2.1 * 10. Let me calculate that: 25,000 * 21 = 525,000 J.

Next, melting the ice into water. The formula here is Q = m * Lf, where Lf is the latent heat of fusion for ice. I think it's around 334 J/g. So, 25,000 g * 334 J/g. Let's see, 25,000 * 334. Well, 25,000 * 300 is 7,500,000, and 25,000 *34 is 850,000. Adding those together gives 7,500,000 + 850,000 = 8,350,000 J.

Third step is heating the water from 0°C to 100°C. The specific heat of water is 4.184 J/g°C. So, Q = 25,000 g * 4.184 J/g°C * (100 - 0)°C. That's 25,000 * 4.184 * 100. Let me compute that: 25,000 * 418.4 = 10,460,000 J.

Finally, vaporizing the water into steam. The latent heat of vaporization for water is about 2,260 J/g. So, Q = 25,000 g * 2,260 J/g. That's 25,000 * 2,260. Let me do that: 25,000 * 2,000 is 50,000,000, and 25,000 * 260 is 6,500,000. Adding them together gives 56,500,000 J.

Now, I'll add all these steps together to get the total heat required.

1. Heating ice: 525,000 J
2. Melting ice: 8,350,000 J
3. Heating water: 10,460,000 J
4. Vaporizing water: 56,500,000 J

Adding them up:

525,000 + 8,350,000 = 8,875,000

8,875,000 + 10,460,000 = 19,335,000

19,335,000 + 56,500,000 = 75,835,000 J.

Wait, but the options are in Calories. Oh right, I almost forgot. 1 Calorie (as used in food) is 1 kilocalorie, which is 4,184 J. So, I need to convert Joules to Calories by dividing by 4,184.

75,835,000 J ÷ 4,184 ≈ let's see. 75,835,000 / 4,184 ≈ approx 18,120 Calories.

Looking at the options, the closest one is J: 19,000 Cal. Wait, but maybe I made a miscalculation somewhere. Let me double-check my steps.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculations. Let me recalculate each step more carefully.

Heating ice: 25,000 g * 2.1 J/g°C * 10°C = 25,000 * 21 = 525,000 J.

Melting: 25,000 * 334 = 8,350,000 J.

Heating water: 25,000 * 4.184 * 100 = 25,000 * 418.4 = 10,460,000 J.

Vaporizing: 25,000 * 2,260 = 56,500,000 J.

Total: 525,000 + 8,350,000 = 8,875,000; +10,460,000 = 19,335,000; +56,500,000 = 75,835,000 J.

Convert to Calories: 75,835,000 / 4,184 ≈ ?

Let me calculate that more accurately. 

4,184 * 18,000 = 75,312,000. 

75,835,000 - 75,312,000 = 523,000.

523,000 / 4,184 ≈ approx 125.

So total is approx 18,125 Calories. Looking at the options, the closest is I: 20,000 Cal. Wait, but none of the options is exactly 18,000. Hmm. Let me check if I used the correct numbers.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with the latent heat of vaporization. Let me confirm. The latent heat of vaporization for water is approximately 2,260 J/g. Yes, that's correct.

Wait, maybe I should check if the question uses calories or kilocalories. Oh, the options are in Cal, which is kilocalories. So, yes, I did the right conversion.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recalculate the total.

Heating ice: 25,000 * 2.1 * 10 = 525,000 J.

Melting: 25,000 * 334 = 8,350,000 J.

Heating water: 25,000 * 4.184 * 100 = 10,460,000 J.

Vaporizing: 25,000 * 2260 = 56,500,000 J.

Sum: 525,000 + 8,350,000 = 8,875,000. Plus 10,460,000 = 19,335,000. Plus 56,500,000 = 75,835,000 J.

75,835,000 J / 4,184 ≈ 18,125 kcal, which is 18,125 Calories.

Looking at the options again:

A:21,000

B:15,000

C:23,000

D:16,000

E:18,000

F:25,000

G:22,500

H:17,500

I:20,000

J:19,000

E is 18,000, which is close to 18,125. But wait, perhaps I messed up the latent heat of vaporization. Maybe it's 2,260 J/g, which is correct. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the latent heat in different units.

Wait, sometimes people use 2.42 * 10^6 J/kg for vaporization. Let me check that. 2,260 J/g is 2,260,000 J/kg. So that's consistent. So the calculation seems right.

So the total is approximately 18,125 Calories. The closest option is E: 18,000 Cal. But looking at the options, J is 19,000, which is a bit higher. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation somewhere.

Wait, maybe the specific heat of ice is 2.09 instead of 2.1. Let me recalculate that step. 25,000 g * 2.09 J/g°C * 10°C.

25,000 * 2.09 = 52,250 J. *10 = 522,500 J. That's a slight decrease, but not enough to bring the total up to 19,000.

Alternatively, perhaps the latent heat of vaporization is higher. Let me check: some sources say it's 2,260,000 J/kg, which is 2,260 J/g. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the specific heat of water is 4.186 instead of 4.184. Let me see: 25,000 * 4.186 * 100 = 25,000 * 418.6 = 10,465,000 J. That doesn't change much.

Hmm, maybe I should check if I added all the steps correctly. 525k + 8,350k = 8,875k. +10,460k = 19,335k. +56,500k = 75,835k J.

Wait, 75,835,000 J divided by 4,184 is approximately 18,125. So the correct answer should be around 18,125, which isn't an option. The closest option is E:18,000, but J is 19,000. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the steps. Let me think about another approach.

Wait, maybe the problem is asking for Calories, which are kilocalories. So perhaps the specific heat capacities should be in kcal/(kg°C). Let me try recalculating everything in kcal to avoid confusion.

Specific heat of ice: 0.5 kcal/(kg·°C). Because 2.1 J/g°C is 0.5 kcal/kg°C (since 1 kcal = 4184 J, so 2.1 J/g = 2100 J/kg = 0.5 kcal/kg, because 2100 / 4184 ≈ 0.5).

Mass is 25 kg.

Heating ice from -10 to 0: Q = 25 kg * 0.5 kcal/(kg·°C) * 10°C = 25 * 0.5 *10 = 125 kcal.

Melting ice: latent heat of fusion is 80 kcal/kg (I think that's correct because 334 J/g is 334,000 J/kg, and 334,000 /4184 ≈ 80 kcal/kg). So 25 kg * 80 kcal/kg = 2000 kcal.

Heating water from 0 to 100: specific heat of water is 1 kcal/(kg·°C). So 25 kg * 1 *100 = 2500 kcal.

Vaporizing: latent heat of vaporization is 540 kcal/kg (since 2,260,000 J/kg /4184 ≈ 540 kcal/kg). So 25 kg * 540 = 13,500 kcal.

Now, adding all these up:

125 (ice heating) + 2000 (melting) = 2125.

2125 + 2500 (water heating) = 4625.

4625 + 13,500 (vaporizing) = 18,125 kcal.

So that's 18,125 Calories, which matches the earlier calculation. The options don't have this exact number, but E is 18,000 and J is 19,000. Since 18,125 is closer to 18,000 than 19,000, the correct answer should be E:18,000 Cal. But wait, looking back at the options, E is 18,000.

Alternatively, perhaps the latent heat of vaporization is taken as 539 kcal/kg, which would give 25 * 539 = 13,475 kcal. Then total would be 125 + 2000 + 2500 +13,475 = 18,100. Still around 18,100.

So the closest option is E:18,000. But wait, the options don't have 18,100. Hmm, perhaps I should look for any calculation mistakes again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the latent heat of fusion. Let me check: 334 J/g is 334,000 J/kg. Divided by 4184 J/kcal/kg gives 334,000 /4184 ≈ 80 kcal/kg. So that's correct.

Hmm, but the options don't have 18,100. The closest is E:18,000. So I think the answer is E.

To determine the heat required to change 25 kg of ice at -10°C to steam at 100°C, we calculate the heat for each phase change and temperature change:

1. **Heating ice from -10°C to 0°C**:  
   \( Q = m \cdot c_{\text{ice}} \cdot \Delta T = 25 \, \text{kg} \cdot 2.1 \, \text{J/g°C} \cdot 10 \, \text{°C} = 525,000 \, \text{J} \).

2. **Melting ice to water at 0°C**:  
   \( Q = m \cdot L_f = 25 \, \text{kg} \cdot 334 \, \text{J/g} = 8,350,000 \, \text{J} \).

3. **Heating water from 0°C to 100°C**:  
   \( Q = m \cdot c_{\text{water}} \cdot \Delta T = 25 \, \text{kg} \cdot 4.184 \, \text{J/g°C} \cdot 100 \, \text{°C} = 10,460,000 \, \text{J} \).

4. **Vaporizing water to steam at 100°C**:  
   \( Q = m \cdot L_v = 25 \, \text{kg} \cdot 2,260 \, \text{J/g} = 56,500,000 \, \text{J} \).

**Total heat required**:  
\( Q_{\text{total}} = 525,000 \, \text{J} + 8,350,000 \, \text{J} + 10,460,000 \, \text{J} + 56,500,000 \, \text{J} = 75,835,000 \, \text{J} \).

Convert to Calories (\(1 \, \text{Cal} = 4,184 \, \text{J}\)):  
\( Q_{\text{total}} = \frac{75,835,000}{4,184} \approx 18,125 \, \text{Cal} \).

The closest option to \(18,125 \, \text{Cal}\) is **E: 18,000 Cal**.
