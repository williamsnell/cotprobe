Okay, so I have this question about Buddhist thinkers and which one emphasizes self-sacrifice as an important theme. The options are A through J, each with different names. I need to figure out who among them is known for self-sacrifice.

First, I'll try to recall what I know about each of these figures. Let's go through them one by one.

Option A: Mahasi Sayadaw. I think he's associated with the Thai Forest Tradition and the Vipassana movement. He's known for his teachings on insight meditation, but I'm not sure if self-sacrifice is a major theme of his teachings.

Option B: Bhikkhu Bodhi. He's a well-known Buddhist monk and scholar, especially in the Theravada tradition. He's written a lot about Buddhist philosophy and practice, but I don't remember him focusing particularly on self-sacrifice. More on understanding the teachings and maybe ethical living, but not sure about self-sacrifice.

Option C: Zen Master Seung Sahn. He's a Korean Zen teacher. Zen often emphasizes things like mindfulness, the present moment, and perhaps self-realization. I don't recall self-sacrifice being a central theme in his teachings. More about direct pointing to the nature of mind.

Option D: Shaku Soyen. He's a Japanese Zen teacher, I think. His teachings might focus more on the practical aspects of Zen, like koans and meditation. Not sure if self-sacrifice is a key theme here either.

Option E: Pema Chödrön. She's a Tibetan Buddhist teacher and is well-known for her teachings on dealing with difficult emotions and cultivating compassion. I remember she talks a lot about embracing challenges and not avoiding suffering, which might tie into self-sacrifice in the sense of taking on suffering for others. That seems possible.

Option F: Daisetsu T. Suzuki. He was a prominent figure in bringing Zen to the West. His work is more about the philosophy and culture of Zen, perhaps focusing on concepts like emptiness and the nature of reality. I don't think self-sacrifice is a central theme in his writings.

Option G: Thich Nhat Hanh. He's a Vietnamese Zen teacher known for his work on mindfulness and peace. He's also a monk who lived a simple life and was involved in social action. His teachings emphasize compassion, loving-kindness, and the interconnection of all beings. Self-sacrifice in the sense of giving up one's own interests for others' well-being seems to fit here. He's a strong candidate.

Option H: Walpola Rahula. He was a Sri Lankan Buddhist monk and author. He wrote about Buddhist philosophy, including works like "What the Buddha Taught." His focus is more on the core teachings of Buddhism, including the Four Noble Truths and the Eightfold Path. While he emphasizes the path to liberation, self-sacrifice as a theme doesn't immediately come to mind.

Option I: The Dalai Lama. He's a prominent Tibetan Buddhist leader known for his advocacy of peace, compassion, and non-violence. His teachings often revolve around the importance of inner peace and ethical living. While he does talk about the importance of selfless action and serving others, I'm not sure if self-sacrifice is the main theme he's known for, or if it's more about compassion and wisdom.

Option J: Ajahn Chah. He's a Thai Theravada monk and teacher in the Forest Tradition. His teachings focus on simplicity, mindfulness, and the practice of the Dharma. He's known for his down-to-earth approach and emphasis on living the teachings, but I don't recall self-sacrifice being a central theme in his teachings.

Now, considering all these, E (Pema Chödrön) and G (Thich Nhat Hanh) seem the most likely. Pema Chödrön talks about not avoiding suffering, which can lead to self-sacrifice in the sense of taking on others' pain. Thich Nhat Hanh's emphasis on compassion and serving others also touches on self-sacrifice.

Wait, another thought: Thich Nhat Hanh's concept of "interbeing" suggests that our well-being is connected to others', so acting selflessly for others' sake is part of that. Pema Chödrön's teachings, especially in books like "The Places That Scare You," focus on transforming suffering and difficulty, which could involve self-sacrifice in the process.

But I think the Dalai Lama is often associated with self-sacrifice because of his life's work, but the question is about the thinker known for it as a theme. Thich Nhat Hanh might be more directly linked to it through his teachings on compassion and non-egoism.

The correct answer is **G: Thich Nhat Hanh**. Thich Nhat Hanh emphasizes self-sacrifice through his teachings on compassion and serving others, aligning with the theme of self-sacrifice.

**Answer: G**
