Okay, so I have this question about Johnson's salary and fringe benefits, and I need to figure out how much he has to include in his gross income. Hmm, let's break it down step by step.

Alright, Johnson works for ABC Co. and earns a salary of $100,000. That's straightforward. But then there's this fringe benefit: group term life insurance at twice his salary. Wait, so twice $100,000 would be $200,000. But I remember something about the IRS and how they handle term life insurance for tax purposes.

The question mentions the IRS established uniform cost of insurance is $2.76 per $1,000. I think this is the rate the IRS uses to determine the taxable value of group-term life insurance. So, the key here is to figure out how much of the insurance is taxable.

Wait, I recall that the first $50,000 of group-term life insurance coverage is not taxable. That's the general rule, right? So any amount above $50,000 is considered taxable income. Let me confirm that. Yes, for group-term life insurance, the first $50k is tax-free, and anything above that is added to the employee's income.

So, Johnson's coverage is $200,000. Subtract the $50k, so the taxable portion is $150,000. Now, I need to calculate the taxable amount using the uniform cost rate.

The rate is $2.76 per $1,000. So, for $150,000, that's 150 x 2.76. Let me compute that. 150 times 2 is 300, and 150 times 0.76 is 114, so adding them together gives 414. So, the taxable amount from the insurance is $414.

Wait, but Johnson's salary is $100,000. So his gross income would be his salary plus the taxable part of the insurance. That would be 100,000 + 414 = $100,414. Let me make sure I didn't miss anything.

Is there any other component I need to consider? Like, is the entire $200k taxable beyond $50k, and I applied the rate correctly? Yes, because only the amount over $50k is taxable, which is 150k. So 150k multiplied by 2.76 per 1k gives 150*2.76=414. That seems right.

Looking at the options, option D is $100,414. So that should be the correct answer.

The amount Johnson must include in gross income is calculated by adding his salary to the taxable portion of his group-term life insurance. The first $50,000 of coverage is non-taxable, with the remaining $150,000 taxed at $2.76 per $1,000, resulting in $414. Adding this to his salary gives $100,414.

Answer: D
