Okay, I'm trying to figure out the answer to this question about elements found in advanced animal societies. The question is a multiple-choice one with options A through G. Let me go through each option one by one to see which makes the most sense.

First, the question is asking about advanced animal societies. I'm assuming this refers to more complex social structures, maybe like those found in certain mammals or other animals with complex social behaviors.

Option A: Language development, agricultural practices, and written communication. Wait, I think language is more of a human thing. I know some animals can communicate, but advanced language? Maybe not. Agricultural practices are definitely human activities, as are written communications. So A might not be correct.

Option B: Economic systems, legal structures, political elections. These terms sound very human. While some animal societies have social structures, I don't think they have formal economic systems or legal structures like humans. Political elections are also human concepts. So B is probably not right.

Option C: Adaptation, evolution, species diversity. These are broader biological concepts. While important, they are more about survival and genetic changes over time, not specifically about social structures within a society. So C might not be the best fit.

Option D: Cultural traditions, artistic expression, philosophy. These are definitely human-centric. While some animals might have behaviors that could be seen as traditions, the level of culture and art as in D seems too advanced for most animals. So D is likely incorrect.

Option E: Leadership, territory, dominance hierarchy. This sounds plausible. Many animal societies, like those in primates or wolves, have leaders and dominance hierarchies. They also have territories they defend. This seems to fit advanced animal societies well.

Option F: Family structure, food chains, migration patterns. Family structures are definitely part of animal societies, but food chains are more about the ecosystem and not specifically social structures. Migration is a behavior, but again, not a social element. So F is a mix, but perhaps not the best answer.

Option G: Habitat selection, mating rituals, parental care. These are all important aspects of animal life, but again, they are more individual or pair-based behaviors rather than elements of a complex society. So G might not be the best fit.

So, looking back, Option E seems to capture elements that are present in more advanced animal societies. Leadership, like alpha animals, and dominance hierarchies are common. Territories are also defended by many social animals. Therefore, I think the correct answer is E.

The answer is E.
