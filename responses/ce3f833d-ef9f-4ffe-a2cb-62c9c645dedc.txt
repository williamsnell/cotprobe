Okay, so I've got this economics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

Mr. Ellis sells "BuzzbeeFrisbess" door-to-door. Right now, he sells 500 frisbees a month at $5 each. Next month, he wants to sell 1000 frisbees to get an extra vacation. He's planning to lower the price instead of working harder. The demand elasticity is given as e = -3. I need to find the new price he should charge using average values for P and Q.

Hmm, I remember that price elasticity of demand (e) is calculated using the formula:

e = (Percentage change in quantity demanded) / (Percentage change in price)

Or, alternatively, using the formula:

e = (ΔQ / ΔP) * (P / Q)

Wait, no, more accurately, it's:

e = (ΔQ / ΔP) * (P / Q)

But when using the midpoint formula to calculate elasticity, we take the average of initial and final prices and quantities. So, since the question says to use average values for P and Q, I think I should compute the average price and average quantity first.

Right now, his price is $5, and he sells 500 units. He wants to sell 1000 units next month. So the quantity change is from 500 to 1000, which is an increase of 500. The average quantity would be (500 + 1000)/2 = 750.

Similarly, the price will change from $5 to some lower price, say P. The average price would be (5 + P)/2.

Wait, but the question is about finding the new price P that will lead to a quantity of 1000. So I can set up the elasticity equation using the average values.

Given e = -3, and we need to relate the percentage change in quantity to the percentage change in price.

The formula using average values is:

e = (Q2 - Q1)/( (Q1 + Q2)/2 ) / (P2 - P1)/( (P1 + P2)/2 )

But since we're using average values, maybe it's better to express it as:

e = (ΔQ / ΔP) * ( (P1 + P2)/2 ) / ( (Q1 + Q2)/2 )

Wait, perhaps it's better to rearrange the elasticity formula. Let me think.

We know that:

e = (ΔQ / ΔP) * (P / Q)

But since we're using average P and average Q, it becomes:

e = (ΔQ / ΔP) * ( (P1 + P2)/2 ) / ( (Q1 + Q2)/2 )

Wait, no, maybe another approach. Let's denote initial P as P1 = $5, initial Q as Q1 = 500. The new Q is Q2 = 1000. We need to find P2.

We can use the formula:

e = ( (Q2 - Q1) / (Q1 + Q2)/2 ) / ( (P2 - P1) / (P1 + P2)/2 )

Which simplifies to:

e = [ (Q2 - Q1) / ( (Q1 + Q2)/2 ) ] / [ (P2 - P1) / ( (P1 + P2)/2 ) ]

Plugging in the numbers:

e = -3 = [ (1000 - 500) / 750 ] / [ (P2 - 5) / ((5 + P2)/2) ]

Wait, let me compute the numerator first.

ΔQ = 1000 - 500 = 500
Average Q = (500 + 1000)/2 = 750
So the percentage change in Q is (500 / 750) = 2/3 ≈ 0.6667, or 66.67%

Now, the denominator in the elasticity formula would be the percentage change in P.

Let me denote P2 as the new price we're trying to find.

ΔP = P2 - 5
Average P = (5 + P2)/2

So the percentage change in P is (P2 -5) / [ (5 + P2)/2 ] = [2(P2 -5)] / (5 + P2)

So putting it all together:

e = (66.67%) / [ (2(P2 -5)) / (5 + P2) ) ] = -3

Because e is negative, but when using absolute values, we can think of the magnitude.

So:

66.67% / [ (2(P2 -5)) / (5 + P2) ) ] = 3

Because elasticity is given as -3, but we can use the absolute value since we're dealing with magnitudes here.

So:

66.67% = 3 * [ (2(P2 -5)) / (5 + P2) ) ]

Let me write 66.67% as 0.6667.

0.6667 = 3 * [ (2(P2 -5)) / (5 + P2) ) ]

Divide both sides by 3:

0.6667 / 3 ≈ 0.2222 = [ (2(P2 -5)) / (5 + P2) ) ]

So:

(2(P2 -5)) / (5 + P2) = 0.2222

Multiply both sides by (5 + P2):

2(P2 -5) = 0.2222*(5 + P2)

Expand both sides:

2P2 -10 = 1.111 + 0.2222 P2

Now, bring all terms to one side:

2P2 - 0.2222 P2 = 1.111 +10

Calculate 2P2 -0.2222P2 = (2 - 0.2222)P2 ≈ 1.7778 P2

So:

1.7778 P2 = 11.111

Divide both sides by 1.7778:

P2 = 11.111 / 1.7778 ≈ 6.25

Wait, that can't be right because Mr. Ellis is lowering the price to increase quantity. So P2 should be less than 5, not higher. Hmm, I must have made a mistake in my calculations.

Let me check the steps again.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the sign somewhere. Let me go back.

In the elasticity formula, the percentage changes are in numerator and denominator. Since price is decreasing, P2 < P1, so (P2 - P1) is negative, and average P is positive. So the percentage change in price is negative. But since elasticity is negative, perhaps I should keep the sign in mind.

Alternatively, maybe I should take absolute values since the sign can be confusing.

Let me try another approach. The formula for price elasticity of demand is:

e = (ΔQ / ΔP) * (P / Q)

But when using average values, it's often expressed as:

e = (Q2 - Q1)/( (Q1 + Q2)/2 ) / (P2 - P1)/( (P1 + P2)/2 )

Which simplifies to:

e = [ (Q2 - Q1) / ( (Q1 + Q2)/2 ) ] / [ (P2 - P1) / ( (P1 + P2)/2 ) ]

So plugging in the numbers:

e = [ (1000 - 500) / 750 ] / [ (P2 -5) / ( (5 + P2)/2 ) ]

Which is:

e = (500 / 750) / [ (P2 -5) * 2 / (5 + P2) ]

Simplify 500/750 = 2/3 ≈ 0.6667

So:

-3 = (0.6667) / [ (2(P2 -5)) / (5 + P2) ]

Multiply both sides by denominator:

-3 * [ (2(P2 -5)) / (5 + P2) ) ] = 0.6667

But since elasticity is negative, perhaps I should take the absolute value and handle the signs correctly.

Let me consider the absolute value approach to avoid confusion.

|e| = 3 = (500/750) / ( (P2 -5) * 2 / (5 + P2) )

So,

3 = (2/3) / [ (2(P2 -5))/(5 + P2) ]

Multiply both sides by denominator:

3 * [ (2(P2 -5))/(5 + P2) ) ] = 2/3

Multiply both sides by (5 + P2):

3 * 2 (P2 -5) = (2/3)(5 + P2)

Simplify left side: 6(P2 -5) = (2/3)(5 + P2)

Multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate fraction:

18(P2 -5) = 2(5 + P2)

Expand:

18P2 -90 = 10 + 2P2

Bring terms together:

18P2 -2P2 = 10 +90

16P2 = 100

P2 = 100 /16 = 6.25

Wait, that's the same result as before, but it's higher than $5, which can't be right because Mr. Ellis is lowering the price to increase sales. So I must have made a mistake in my approach.

Wait, perhaps I inverted the formula. Let me double-check the formula.

Actually, the correct formula for price elasticity using average values is:

e = ( (Q2 - Q1)/( (Q1 + Q2)/2 ) ) / ( (P2 - P1)/( (P1 + P2)/2 ) )

Which is:

e = [ (Q2 - Q1) / average Q ] / [ (P2 - P1) / average P ]

So in this case:

e = (500 / 750) / ( (P2 -5) / ( (5 + P2)/2 ) )

Which is:

-3 = (2/3) / [ (P2 -5) * 2 / (5 + P2) ]

Wait, let me compute the denominator correctly.

(P2 -5) divided by average P, which is (5 + P2)/2, so:

[ (P2 -5) / ( (5 + P2)/2 ) ] = 2*(P2 -5)/(5 + P2)

So,

-3 = (2/3) / [ 2*(P2 -5)/(5 + P2) ]

Simplify denominator:

= (2/3) * [ (5 + P2) / (2*(P2 -5)) ]

The 2s cancel out:

= (2/3) * (5 + P2) / (2(P2 -5)) ) → (2/3) * (5+P2)/(2(P2-5)) ) → (5+P2)/(3(P2-5))

So,

-3 = (5 + P2) / [3(P2 -5)]

Multiply both sides by 3(P2 -5):

-9(P2 -5) = 5 + P2

Expand left side:

-9P2 +45 =5 + P2

Bring all terms to left:

-9P2 - P2 +45 -5 =0 → -10P2 +40=0

So,

-10P2 = -40 → P2=4

Ah, that makes sense. So the new price should be $4. Checking the options, option C is $4.

To determine the price Mr. Ellis should charge to sell 1,000 "BuzzbeeFrisbees" given a price elasticity of demand \( e = -3 \), we use the formula for price elasticity of demand using average values for price (\( P \)) and quantity (\( Q \)):

\[
e = \frac{\frac{\Delta Q}{\text{average } Q}}{\frac{\Delta P}{\text{average } P}}
\]

### Step 1: Define the variables
- Initial price (\( P_1 \)) = \$5
- Initial quantity (\( Q_1 \)) = 500
- Desired quantity (\( Q_2 \)) = 1,000
- New price (\( P_2 \)) = ?

### Step 2: Calculate average values
- Average quantity (\( \text{average } Q \)) = \(\frac{Q_1 + Q_2}{2} = \frac{500 + 1000}{2} = 750\)
- Average price (\( \text{average } P \)) = \(\frac{P_1 + P_2}{2} = \frac{5 + P_2}{2}\)

### Step 3: Compute the percentage change in quantity
\[
\Delta Q = Q_2 - Q_1 = 1000 - 500 = 500
\]
\[
\frac{\Delta Q}{\text{average } Q} = \frac{500}{750} = \frac{2}{3} \approx 0.6667
\]

### Step 4: Set up the elasticity equation
\[
e = \frac{\frac{\Delta Q}{\text{average } Q}}{\frac{\Delta P}{\text{average } P}}
\]
\[
-3 = \frac{0.6667}{\frac{\Delta P}{\text{average } P}}
\]

### Step 5: Solve for \( \Delta P \)
\[
\frac{\Delta P}{\text{average } P} = \frac{0.6667}{-3} \approx -0.2222
\]
\[
\Delta P = -0.2222 \times \text{average } P = -0.2222 \times \frac{5 + P_2}{2}
\]

### Step 6: Relate \( \Delta P \) to \( P_2 \)
\[
\Delta P = P_2 - P_1 = P_2 - 5
\]
\[
P_2 - 5 = -0.2222 \times \frac{5 + P_2}{2}
\]

### Step 7: Solve for \( P_2 \)
Multiply both sides by 2:
\[
2(P_2 - 5) = -0.2222(5 + P_2)
\]
\[
2P_2 - 10 = -1.111 - 0.2222P_2
\]
\[
2P_2 + 0.2222P_2 = 10 - 1.111
\]
\[
2.2222P_2 = 8.889
\]
\[
P_2 = \frac{8.889}{2.2222} \approx 4
\]

### Conclusion
Mr. Ellis should charge \$4 to sell 1,000 "BuzzbeeFrisbees."
