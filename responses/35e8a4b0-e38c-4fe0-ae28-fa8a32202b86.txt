Question:

This question refers to the following information.
"In 1500 that work appeared which Erasmus had written after his misfortune at Dover, and had dedicated to Mountjoy, the Adagiorum Collectanea. It was a collection of about eight hundred proverbial sayings drawn from the Latin authors of antiquity and elucidated for the use of those who aspired to write an elegant Latin style. In the dedication Erasmus pointed out the profit an author may derive, both in ornamenting his style and in strengthening his argumentation, from having at his disposal a good supply of sentences hallowed by their antiquity. He proposes to offer such a help to his readers. What he actually gave was much more. He familiarized a much wider circle than the earlier humanists had reached with the spirit of antiquity.
Until this time the humanists had, to some extent, monopolized the treasures of classic culture, in order to parade their knowledge of which the multitude remained destitute, and so to become strange prodigies of learning and elegance. With his irresistible need of teaching and his sincere love for humanity and its general culture, Erasmus introduced the classic spirit, in so far as it could be reflected in the soul of a sixteenth-century Christian, among the people. Not he alone; but none more extensively and more effectively. Not among all the people, it is true, for by writing in Latin he limited his direct influence to the educated classes, which in those days were the upper classes.
Erasmus made current the classic spirit. Humanism ceased to be the exclusive privilege of a few. According to Beatus Rhenanus he had been reproached by some humanists, when about to publish the Adagia, for divulging the mysteries of their craft. But he desired that the book of antiquity should be open to all."

Okay, so I've got this question about Erasmus and his legacy compared to earlier humanists. I'm a bit rusty on my history, but let me try to break this down.

The passage talks about Erasmus and his Adagiorum Collectanea, which is a collection of proverbs. He wrote this after some misfortune at Dover and dedicated it to Mountjoy. The main point here is that Erasmus took these Latin proverbs from antiquity and made them available for people who wanted to write elegant Latin. He thought that having access to these old sayings would help writers both ornament their style and strengthen their arguments. But according to Huizinga, Erasmus's impact was bigger than earlier humanists because he did something more.

The passage mentions that before Erasmus, humanists kind of kept the treasures of classical culture to themselves, making them seem like prodigies because the general public didn't have access. Erasmus, though, wanted to introduce the classic spirit to more people, not just the educated elites. He wrote in Latin, which limited his direct influence to the educated classes, but he made the classic spirit more accessible. The key here is that he wasn't just keeping it exclusive; he was trying to spread it wider.

Looking at the options, I need to find which one matches this idea that Erasmus made the classic spirit more accessible. Let's go through them one by one.

A: He wrote exclusively about religious matters. The passage doesn't say that. It's about proverbs and classic sayings, so probably not A.

B: He wrote more books than his predecessors. The passage doesn't compare the number of books; it's about the impact, not quantity. So B is unlikely.

C: He was the first to translate Latin proverbs into the vernacular. The passage says he wrote in Latin, but it's not clear if he translated into other languages. Plus, the point is about making the spirit accessible, not translating. So maybe not C.

D: He was more critical of the Church. The passage doesn't mention his stance on the Church beyond the context of his misfortune at Dover, which I think was a shipwreck. Not sure about D.

E: He had a wider variety of interests. The passage talks about his work on proverbs and bringing classic culture to more people, but it's not about having more varied interests. So E might not be it.

F: He was less interested in the pomp and circumstance of academia. The passage says he had a sincere love for humanity and general culture, which suggests he was more interested in spreading knowledge than just academic displays. So F could be a contender.

G: He had more support from the Church. The passage doesn't mention church support; in fact, Erasmus had some issues with the Church, but that's not the focus here. So G is probably not correct.

H: He made the classic spirit more accessible by teaching it. The passage says he introduced the classic spirit among people, not just the educated classes. So H seems to fit because he made it accessible beyond the earlier humanists who kept it exclusive.

I: He valued educating the masses more than his predecessors. The passage does say he aimed to make it accessible, but it's more about the spirit of antiquity being available to a wider audience, not necessarily a focus on mass education per se. So I is possible but maybe not the best fit.

J: He wrote in a language understandable to the masses. The passage mentions he wrote in Latin, which was for the educated classes. So J is not correct because he didn't write in the vernacular.

So narrowing it down, H and I are the main contenders. The passage says Erasmus made the classic spirit more accessible, not necessarily that he focused on educating the masses. So I think H is the better answer.

According to Huizinga, Erasmus's legacy was more significant because he made the classic spirit more accessible by teaching it to a broader audience, unlike earlier humanists who kept it exclusive. 

Answer: H
