Okay, so I've got this question about lateral communication in an organization. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me start by understanding what lateral communication means. From what I remember, communication in organizations can be vertical or horizontal. Vertical is when it goes up or down the hierarchy, like a manager giving instructions to their team. Horizontal, or lateral, communication is between people on the same level, maybe in different departments. 

The question is asking how lateral communication occurs, so I'm looking for an option that describes this horizontal flow. Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A says information is shared only during official meetings. Hmm, that might be part of it, but lateral communication isn't just limited to meetings. People can communicate informally too, so A doesn't seem right.

Option B is about information being restricted within a single department. Wait, that sounds more like poor communication rather than lateral. Lateral should be across departments, so B is probably wrong.

Option C talks about external stakeholders. Lateral communication is internal, between departments, so C doesn't fit.

Option D says information is transferred only through the head of the organization. That's more like a centralized, top-down approach, not lateral. So D is out.

Option E is about public announcements. That's more of a one-way communication from the organization to everyone, not specifically lateral between departments.

Option F is information passing upwards. That's vertical, upwards communication, so not lateral.

Option G is information passing downwards. Again, vertical, so not the answer.

Option H says information is a two-way process. While lateral communication is two-way, the question is about how it occurs, not just the direction. So H might be a part of it, but not the complete answer.

Option I is information passing diagonally between different levels. That's diagonal communication, which involves both different levels and maybe different departments, but lateral is specifically across the same level, not diagonally.

Option J is information passing between different departments and functions. That sounds exactly like lateral communication. It's about sharing info across different areas within the same level.

So putting it all together, the correct answer should be J because it describes the horizontal, department-to-department communication that's lateral.

The correct answer is J: Information passes between different departments and functions.
