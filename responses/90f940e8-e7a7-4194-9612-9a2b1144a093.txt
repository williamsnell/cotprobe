Okay, so I need to figure out which methods are used to measure arousal. Let me think about this step by step. 

Arousal refers to the state of being physiologically or psychologically activated. It's often associated with changes in the body's responses to stimuli. So, how do scientists or psychologists measure this?

First, I remember that arousal can be assessed through various physiological indicators. Let's go through each option one by one.

Option A: Thermal imaging. I'm not too sure about this. Thermal imaging detects heat, so maybe if someone is aroused, their body temperature increases. But I don't recall thermal imaging being a common method for measuring arousal. It's more often used for things like detecting fever or heat loss.

Option B: Vision acuity test. Vision acuity tests measure how well someone can see. I don't think this directly relates to arousal. Maybe if someone is aroused, their focus might be better, but vision acuity seems more about eyesight than arousal levels.

Option C: Saliva acidity. Saliva pH can change based on stress or arousal. Stress can increase acidity, so maybe this is a method. I'm not entirely sure, but I think some studies might look at saliva for stress hormones like cortisol, which could be linked to arousal.

Option D: Taste test. This seems unrelated. Taste tests assess how well someone can perceive flavors, which doesn't directly measure arousal.

Option E: EEG, heart rate, breathing rate, blood pressure, skin conductance, pupil size. These all sound familiar. EEG measures brain activity, which can indicate different states like relaxation or arousal. Heart rate increases with arousal. Breathing rate also tends to increase. Blood pressure goes up when aroused. Skin conductance, also known as galvanic skin response, is a well-known method for measuring arousal because sweat production increases, affecting skin conductivity. Pupil dilation can also be a sign of arousal. So this option seems comprehensive and correct.

Option F: MRI. MRI is used to see brain structures and activity, but it's more for detailed imaging rather than real-time arousal measurement. It's not a typical method for continuous arousal assessment.

Option G: Blood sugar test. Blood sugar levels are related to metabolism and diabetes, not directly to arousal. So probably not this one.

Option H: Muscle strength test. Testing how strong someone's muscles are doesn't directly measure arousal. Though maybe if someone is more aroused, their strength might temporarily increase, but it's not a standard method.

Option I: Stethoscope. Using a stethoscope measures heart and lung sounds, which can give information about heart rate and breathing, both of which are physiological indicators of arousal. But a stethoscope alone isn't a standalone method for measuring arousal; it's more of a tool used in conjunction with other methods.

Option J: Hair analysis. Analyzing hair can show long-term stress levels through cortisol levels, but that's not a real-time measurement of arousal. It's more of a retrospective method and not commonly used for immediate arousal assessment.

So, putting it all together, the correct methods are those that directly measure physiological responses. Option E lists several valid methods: EEG, heart rate, breathing rate, blood pressure, skin conductance, and pupil size. These are all standard techniques used in various fields to assess arousal levels. The other options either don't measure arousal or use methods that aren't standard or are indirect.

The correct answer is E, as it lists valid physiological methods for measuring arousal, such as EEG, heart rate, breathing rate, blood pressure, skin conductance, and pupil size.

Answer: E
