Okay, so I've got this problem here about functions and their graphs. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question says that g(x) equals f(-x) for all real numbers x. Hmm, that means g is some kind of transformation of f, right? Specifically, it's a reflection over the y-axis because replacing x with -x reflects the graph across the y-axis.

Now, the problem gives me a point on the graph of g, which is (3, 2). So, that means when x is 3, g(3) is 2. But since g(x) is f(-x), I can write that as g(3) = f(-3) = 2. Wait, so that tells me that f(-3) equals 2. 

But the question is asking which point must be on the graph of f. So, if f(-3) is 2, that means when the input is -3, the output is 2. So in terms of points on the graph, that would be (-3, 2), right? Because the x-coordinate is the input, and the y-coordinate is the output.

Looking at the options, I see that option H is (-3, 2). So that should be the correct answer. Let me just double-check to make sure I didn't mix up anything. If I plug x = 3 into g, I get 2. Since g(x) is f(-x), that's the same as f(-3) = 2. So yes, f at -3 is 2, so the point (-3, 2) is on f's graph. 

I don't think I made any mistakes here. The key was understanding that g is a reflection of f, so the x-coordinate changes sign. So the point (3,2) on g becomes (-3,2) on f.

The function \( g(x) = f(-x) \) implies that \( g \) is a reflection of \( f \) across the y-axis. Given that the point \( (3, 2) \) is on the graph of \( g \), we know \( g(3) = 2 \). Substituting into the equation, \( f(-3) = 2 \). Therefore, the point \( (-3, 2) \) must be on the graph of \( f \).

Answer: H
