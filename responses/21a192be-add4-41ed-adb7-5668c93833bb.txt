Alright, let's try to figure out where Sun Ra claimed he was born. I remember Sun Ra was a pretty famous jazz musician, known for his unique style and his claims about his origins. I think he was an alto saxophonist and a bandleader, right? 

I've heard before that Sun Ra often talked about being from another planet or some otherworldly place. He had this persona where he wasn't from Earth, which was part of his mystique. So, looking at the options, I see choices like Saturn, Atlantis, Mars, etc. 

Wait, I think he specifically mentioned Saturn. I'm not entirely sure, but I recall something about him saying he was born on Saturn. Let me think about other options just to be sure. Atlantis is more of a legendary place, not a planet. Mars was another possibility, but I think Saturn is more likely because he often associated with space themes in his music and persona. 

Also, some of the other options seem a bit off, like being born in a piano or a saxophone. Those are musical instruments, so that doesn't make much sense. Mount Olympus is a mountain, and while it's a famous one, I don't think Sun Ra ever claimed that. Orion's Belt is a constellation, but I'm not sure about that either. New York City is where he was actually born, but I think he denied that and said he was from another place. 

So, putting it all together, I'm leaning towards option A: Saturn as the correct answer.
