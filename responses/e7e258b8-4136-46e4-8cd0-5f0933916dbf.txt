Okay, so I've got this problem here about finding the breakeven point and determining the range of units to produce for a profit. Let me try to work through it step by step.

First, the problem states that the company's revenue function is R = 90 times the square root of (2X), where X is the number of units made. The cost function is given as C = 3X + 1200. I need to find the breakeven point, which is where revenue equals cost, and then determine the range of X where the company makes a profit.

Alright, let's start by setting R equal to C to find the breakeven point. So, I'll write the equation:

90√(2X) = 3X + 1200

Hmm, this looks a bit tricky. I remember that to solve equations involving square roots, sometimes squaring both sides can help eliminate the square root. Let me try that.

First, let's isolate the square root term if possible, but I think it's already isolated on the left side. So, I'll square both sides:

(90√(2X))² = (3X + 1200)²

Calculating each side:

Left side: 90² * (√(2X))² = 8100 * 2X = 16200X

Right side: (3X + 1200)². Let's expand that. It's (3X)^2 + 2*(3X)*(1200) + (1200)^2.

So that's 9X² + 7200X + 1,440,000.

Putting it all together, the equation becomes:

16200X = 9X² + 7200X + 1,440,000

Now, I'll move everything to one side to form a quadratic equation. Let's subtract 16200X from both sides:

0 = 9X² + 7200X + 1,440,000 - 16200X

Simplify the terms:

7200X - 16200X is -9000X, so:

0 = 9X² - 9000X + 1,440,000

I can divide the entire equation by 9 to simplify it:

0 = X² - 1000X + 160,000

Wait, 9000 divided by 9 is 1000, and 1,440,000 divided by 9 is 160,000. So the equation is:

X² - 1000X + 160,000 = 0

Now I need to solve this quadratic equation. Let me use the quadratic formula: X = [1000 ± √(1000² - 4*1*160000)] / 2

Calculating the discriminant:

D = 1000² - 4*1*160000 = 1,000,000 - 640,000 = 360,000

The square root of 360,000 is 600, because 600^2 = 360,000.

So, X = [1000 ± 600] / 2

That gives two solutions:

X = (1000 + 600)/2 = 1600/2 = 800

X = (1000 - 600)/2 = 400/2 = 200

So, the breakeven points are at X=200 and X=800. Wait, that's interesting. That means that at both 200 and 800 units, revenue equals cost.

But wait, how can there be two breakeven points? Usually, a company breaks even at a certain point where they transition from loss to profit. But here, the revenue function is a square root function, which grows slower as X increases, while the cost is linear. So, perhaps the revenue function starts below the cost, then intersects at X=200, then the cost function overtakes again at X=800? Or maybe it's the other way around.

Let me think. The revenue function R = 90√(2X) increases as X increases, but at a decreasing rate. The cost function C = 3X + 1200 increases linearly. So, initially, when X is small, R might be less than C, then R catches up and overtakes C at X=200, making profit. But then, perhaps after X=800, C overtakes R again? That would imply that the company makes a profit between X=200 and X=800.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the revenue function, being a square root, would eventually grow slower than a linear cost function. So after a certain point, the cost would exceed revenue, leading to losses again. So, the company would make a profit between the two breakeven points.

Wait, but wait: Let me test values around these points to see where R > C.

Let me check X=0: R=90√0=0, C=1200. So R<C, loss.

At X=200: R=90√(400)=90*20=1800, C=3*200 +1200=600+1200=1800. So breakeven.

At X=400: R=90√(800)=90*28.284≈2545.56, C=3*400+1200=1200+1200=2400. So R > C, profit.

At X=500: R=90√(1000)=90*31.623≈2846.07, C=3*500+1200=1500+1200=2700. R > C.

At X=600: R=90√(1200)=90*34.641≈3117.7, C=3*600+1200=1800+1200=3000. R > C.

At X=800: R=90√(1600)=90*40=3600, C=3*800+1200=2400+1200=3600. Breakeven again.

At X=900: R=90√(1800)=90*42.426≈3818.34, C=3*900+1200=2700+1200=3900. Now, R < C, loss.

So, the company makes a profit when R > C, which is between X=200 and X=800. Because at X=200 and X=800, R=C, and between them, R > C.

Wait, but wait: When X is between 0 and 200, R < C, so loss. At X=200, breakeven. Then, for X from 200 to 800, R > C, so profit. After X=800, R < C again, so loss.

Wait, but that would mean the profit region is 200 < X < 800. So the company should produce more than 200 units but less than 800 units to make a profit.

Looking at the options, I need to check which one corresponds to 200 < X < 800.

Looking at the options:

Option G: 200 < X < 800.

Yes, that's option G.

Wait, but let me check if I didn't make a mistake in my calculations. Let me recheck the quadratic equation part.

We had R = C, so 90√(2X) = 3X + 1200.

Squared both sides: 8100*(2X) = (3X + 1200)^2 → 16200X = 9X² + 7200X + 1,440,000.

Then, moving all terms to one side: 0 = 9X² + 7200X + 1,440,000 - 16200X → 0 = 9X² -9000X +1,440,000.

Divide by 9: X² - 1000X + 160,000 = 0.

Quadratic formula: X = [1000 ± √(1000^2 -4*1*160000)] / 2 → [1000 ± √(1,000,000 -640,000)] /2 → [1000 ± √360,000]/2 → [1000 ± 600]/2.

So, X= (1000+600)/2=1600/2=800, and X=(1000-600)/2=400/2=200. Correct.

So the breakeven points are at X=200 and X=800.

Thus, the company makes a profit when X is between 200 and 800.

Looking back at the options, option G is 200 < X < 800. So the correct answer should be G.
</think>

To determine the breakeven point and the range of units to produce for a profit, we start by setting the revenue function \( R = 90 \sqrt{2X} \) equal to the cost function \( C = 3X + 1200 \):

\[
90 \sqrt{2X} = 3X + 1200
\]

Squaring both sides to eliminate the square root:

\[
(90 \sqrt{2X})^2 = (3X + 1200)^2
\]

\[
8100 \cdot 2X = 9X^2 + 7200X + 1,440,000
\]

Simplifying:

\[
16200X = 9X^2 + 7200X + 1,440,000
\]

Rearranging terms:

\[
0 = 9X^2 - 9000X + 1,440,000
\]

Dividing by 9:

\[
X^2 - 1000X + 160,000 = 0
\]

Using the quadratic formula \( X = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \) with \( a = 1 \), \( b = -1000 \), and \( c = 160,000 \):

\[
X = \frac{1000 \pm \sqrt{1000^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 160,000}}{2}
\]

\[
X = \frac{1000 \pm \sqrt{360,000}}{2}
\]

\[
X = \frac{1000 \pm 600}{2}
\]

This gives two solutions:

\[
X = \frac{1600}{2} = 800 \quad \text{and} \quad X = \frac{400}{2} = 200
\]

Thus, the breakeven points are at \( X = 200 \) and \( X = 800 \). Testing values around these points shows that the company makes a profit when \( 200 < X < 800 \).

The correct answer is:

**G: 200 < X < 800**
