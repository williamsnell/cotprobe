Alright, so I've got this question about functions between finite sets. Let me try to break it down step by step. Okay, the question says: Let A be a finite set with m elements, and B be a finite set with n elements. We need to find the number of distinct functions mapping A into B.

Hmm, I remember that when talking about functions between sets, each element in set A must be assigned to exactly one element in set B. So if A has m elements, each of those m elements has to pick a unique target in B. But wait, no, actually, they don't have to pick unique targets. The function can map multiple elements of A to the same element in B. So that's important.

Let me think about how many choices each element in A has. For each element in A, there are n possible elements in B it can map to. Since each choice is independent, I think I can use the multiplication principle here. So for the first element in A, there are n choices, for the second, another n choices, and so on, up to the mth element.

So the total number of functions would be n multiplied by itself m times, which is n^m. That makes sense because each of the m elements has n options. So the number of functions is n to the power of m.

Now looking at the options, let's see which one matches this. Option I is n^m. That seems correct. Let me quickly check the other options to make sure I'm not making a mistake.

Option A is m^n, which is the other way around. That would be if we were mapping B into A, but the question is about A into B. So A isn't right. Option G is n!, which is the number of permutations of B, but that's not related to functions from A to B unless m equals n, which it doesn't have to here.

Option I definitely looks like the right choice here. Yeah, I think I'm confident that the answer is I: n^m.

The number of distinct functions mapping a set A with m elements into a set B with n elements is n^m, as each element in A has n choices.
