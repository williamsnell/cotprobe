Question:

A 77-year-old female presents to the office for evaluation of a syncopal event that occurred while she was walking.

The valvular abnormality that most likely caused this episode is

J: mitral stenosis

Okay, so I have this question about a 77-year-old woman who had a syncopal episode while walking. The question is about determining the valvular abnormality that caused this. Let's break it down.

First, I remember that syncope, or fainting, can be caused by various cardiac issues. One common cause is a problem with the heart valves, which can lead to inadequate blood flow to the brain, causing the person to lose consciousness.

The patient is 77 years old, so I'm thinking about age-related valve issues. The cardiac exam shows a grade 3/6 systolic murmur at the right upper sternal border, and it radiates into the neck. That's important.

I recall that the right upper sternal border is where the aortic valve is best heard. So, a murmur there might relate to the aortic valve. The radiation into the neck is a key point. I think murmurs that radiate to the carotid arteries (which are in the neck) are often associated with aortic issues. For example, aortic stenosis has a harsh, crescendo-decrescendo murmur that typically radiates to the neck.

Looking at the options:

A: Bicuspid aortic valve. Bicuspid is common in older adults and can lead to stenosis over time. So that's a possibility.

B: Aortic insufficiency. That's a regurgitation issue, not a stenosis. The murmur for insufficiency is a late systolic ejection click or a decrescendo murmur, I think, not necessarily the harsh sound of stenosis.

C: Mitral valve prolapse. That typically presents with a click-murmur sound, often heard in the apical area, not the right upper sternal border. So probably not.

D: Tricuspid stenosis. That's a less common condition, but the tricuspid area is lower in the chest, around the left lower sternal border. The radiation into the neck doesn't fit as well here.

E: Mitral regurgitation. That's a regurgitation issue, and the murmur is often pansystolic, heard at the apex. Not matching the scenario.

F: Pulmonary regurgitation. Again, a regurgitation issue, but the sound would be heard more towards the left lower sternal border, and it's not common to cause syncope as much as stenosis might.

G: Aortic stenosis. This fits because it's a stenosis of the aortic valve, leading to reduced blood flow to the coronary arteries and possibly the brain, causing syncope. The murmur is harsh and heard at the right upper sternal border, with radiation to the neck.

H: Pulmonary stenosis. Here, the murmur is heard at the left upper sternal border, not the right. So probably not.

I: Tricuspid regurgitation. Same as E, not matching the location or radiation.

J: Mitral stenosis. The murmur is typically early to mid-systolic and heard at the apex. Radiation to the neck isn't a feature I associate with mitral stenosis.

So putting it all together, the murmur's location and radiation point towards aortic stenosis. The syncopal episode could be due to reduced cardiac output when the heart can't pump enough blood, especially during exertion like walking, leading to inadequate cerebral perfusion.

The patient's syncopal event, along with a grade 3/6 systolic murmur at the right upper sternal border and radiation into the neck, points to aortic stenosis as the likely cause. This condition is characterized by a harsh, crescendo-decrescendo murmur that radiates to the carotid arteries, consistent with the findings. Other options do not align with the clinical presentation.
