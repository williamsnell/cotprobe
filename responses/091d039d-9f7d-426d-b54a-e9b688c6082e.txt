Okay, so I have this question about legal ethics, specifically regarding a deposition scenario. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is about what a lawyer should do when subpoenaed to testify about a former client, and the opposing attorney asks for confidential information. The options are A through J, each suggesting a different course of action.

First, I remember that attorney-client privilege is a fundamental concept in law. It protects confidential communications between a lawyer and their client. The privilege is meant to encourage clients to speak openly with their attorneys, knowing that their discussions can't be used against them in court.

Now, in this scenario, the lawyer is a former client's attorney, and they're being deposed. The opposing counsel is asking for confidential information. So, the key issue here is whether the attorney can withhold that information or if they're obligated to provide it.

I think about the rules of evidence and professional conduct. Generally, an attorney cannot be compelled to disclose confidential information about a former client unless the client has waived the privilege. But how does that apply during a deposition?

Depositions are part of the discovery process, where both sides gather information before trial. The rules during a deposition might be more flexible than in a court trial, but I'm not entirely sure. I recall that even in depositions, the attorney can assert privilege and refuse to answer questions that are protected.

Option A says to provide the info only if it helps the former client. That doesn't sound right because the attorney shouldn't be the judge of what's favorable; they should be bound by the rules of privilege.

Option B suggests providing if the client gave verbal permission. But I think a verbal waiver might not be sufficient. Usually, a waiver needs to be in writing, especially if it's for a deposition, to be clear and on the record.

Option C says to provide if it's pertinent. But again, the pertainence doesn't override the privilege. The attorney's duty is to protect the client's information unless there's a waiver.

Option D is about providing if the opposing attorney insists. That doesn't seem right because the attorney has a professional obligation to uphold privilege, not just comply with opposing counsel's demands.

Option E suggests refusing unless the client is present. But the client might not be able to attend, and the attorney's presence alone isn't enough to waive privilege.

Option F says to disclose if enough time has passed. I'm not sure about the time factor. I think the passage of time doesn't automatically waive privilege unless there's a waiver or some other exception.

Option G claims privilege is waived here. I'm not sure about that. I think privilege isn't automatically waived just because the relationship ended. The attorney still holds the information in confidence.

Option H suggests providing if it doesn't harm the client's case. That seems like the attorney is making a judgment call, which they shouldn't do. They should adhere to the rules, not the potential impact.

Option I says to assert the privilege unless there's a signed waiver. That sounds correct because without a client's explicit waiver, the attorney must maintain confidentiality.

Option J advises refusing without a court order. I think during a deposition, the attorney can assert privilege and refuse to answer unless the opposing party moves to compel, which would require a court ruling.

Putting it all together, the correct answer should be I: assert the privilege unless the client has signed a waiver. Because without a waiver, the attorney cannot disclose confidential information, even in a deposition.

I: assert the privilege unless the client has signed a waiver.

The correct answer is I because attorney-client privilege protects confidential information unless explicitly waived in writing. Without a signed waiver, the attorney must refuse to disclose the information.

Answer: I
