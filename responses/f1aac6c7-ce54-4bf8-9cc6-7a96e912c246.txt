Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the percentage ionization of acetic acid. Hmm, let me see. I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, so it doesn't completely dissociate in water. The question gives me the ionization constant, K_a, which is 1.8 × 10^-5. The concentration of the acetic acid solution is 0.5 M. I need to find the percentage of it that ionizes.

Wait, the dissociation reaction is HC₂H₃O₂ ⇌ H⁺ + C₂H₃O₂⁻. Right, because acetic acid donates a proton to become acetate ion. So, the initial concentration is 0.5 M for acetic acid, and the other products (H+ and acetate) start at zero.

I think I need to set up an ICE table. ICE stands for Initial, Change, Equilibrium. So the initial concentrations are: [HC₂H₃O₂] = 0.5 M, [H+] = 0, [C₂H₃O₂⁻] = 0. Then, let's say x is the amount that dissociates. So during the change, HC₂H₃O₂ decreases by x, and H+ and C₂H₃O₂⁻ each increase by x. At equilibrium, [H+] = x, [C₂H₃O₂⁻] = x, and [HC₂H₃O₂] = 0.5 - x.

The expression for K_a is ( [H+][C₂H₃O₂⁻] ) / [HC₂H₃O₂] ) = 1.8e-5. Plugging in the equilibrium concentrations, that becomes (x * x) / (0.5 - x) = 1.8e-5.

So the equation is x² / (0.5 - x) = 1.8e-5. Hmm, solving for x. Since K_a is small, I think x will be much smaller than 0.5, so 0.5 - x ≈ 0.5. That should simplify the equation. So x² ≈ 1.8e-5 * 0.5. Let me calculate that: 1.8e-5 * 0.5 is 9e-6. So x² ≈9e-6, so x ≈ sqrt(9e-6) which is 3e-3. So x is 0.003 M.

Wait, but wait. I should check if the approximation holds. If x is 0.003, then 0.5 - 0.003 is 0.497, which is close enough to 0.5, so the approximation is valid. So x is about 0.003 M.

Now, the percentage ionization is (x / initial concentration) * 100%. So x is 0.003, initial is 0.5. So 0.003 / 0.5 = 0.006. Multiply by 100% gives 0.6%. So the percentage is 0.6%.

Looking at the options, option A is 0.60%, which matches. But wait, let me double-check. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculation. Let me recalculate.

Wait, the K_a is 1.8e-5. So plugging in x²/(0.5 - x) = 1.8e-5. If I don't approximate, I would have to solve the quadratic equation. Let's see: x² = 1.8e-5 * (0.5 - x). So x² = 9e-6 - 1.8e-5 x. Rearranging: x² + 1.8e-5 x - 9e-6 = 0.

Using the quadratic formula: x = [-b ± sqrt(b² +4ac)]/(2a) where a=1, b=1.8e-5, c=-9e-6.

So discriminant D = (1.8e-5)^2 +4*1*9e-6 = (3.24e-10) + 3.6e-5. The sqrt(D) would be sqrt(3.6e-5 + 3.24e-10) ≈ sqrt(3.6e-5) ≈ 5.999e-3 (since 6e-3 squared is 3.6e-5).

So x ≈ [ -1.8e-5 + 6e-3 ] / 2. Because the other root would be negative, which doesn't make sense here. So numerator is approximately 6e-3 - 0.000018 ≈ 5.99982e-3. Divided by 2: 2.99991e-3, which is approximately 0.003 M. So same as before. So x is 0.003 M.

So the percentage is 0.003 / 0.5 * 100 = 0.6%. So option A is correct.

To calculate the percentage ionization of 0.5 M acetic acid with \( K_a = 1.8 \times 10^{-5} \), we start by considering the dissociation equilibrium:

\[
HC_2H_3O_2 \rightleftharpoons H^+ + C_2H_3O_2^-
\]

Using an ICE table, the initial concentrations are: \([HC_2H_3O_2] = 0.5 \, \text{M}\), \([H^+] = 0\), and \([C_2H_3O_2^-] = 0\). Let \( x \) represent the amount of acetic acid that dissociates. At equilibrium, the concentrations are:

\[
[H^+] = x, \quad [C_2H_3O_2^-] = x, \quad [HC_2H_3O_2] = 0.5 - x
\]

The expression for \( K_a \) is:

\[
K_a = \frac{[H^+][C_2H_3O_2^-]}{[HC_2H_3O_2]} = \frac{x^2}{0.5 - x}
\]

Substituting \( K_a = 1.8 \times 10^{-5} \):

\[
\frac{x^2}{0.5 - x} = 1.8 \times 10^{-5}
\]

Since \( K_a \) is small, \( x \ll 0.5 \), so \( 0.5 - x \approx 0.5 \). This simplifies the equation to:

\[
x^2 = 1.8 \times 10^{-5} \times 0.5 = 9 \times 10^{-6}
\]

Solving for \( x \):

\[
x = \sqrt{9 \times 10^{-6}} = 3 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{M}
\]

To verify, solving the quadratic equation \( x^2 + 1.8 \times 10^{-5}x - 9 \times 10^{-6} = 0 \) using the quadratic formula confirms \( x \approx 3 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{M} \).

The percentage ionization is:

\[
\text{Percentage ionization} = \left( \frac{x}{\text{Initial concentration}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{3 \times 10^{-3}}{0.5} \right) \times 100 = 0.6\%
\]

Thus, the correct answer is:

**A: 0.60%**
