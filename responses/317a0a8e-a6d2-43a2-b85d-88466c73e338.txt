Question:

An air conditioner is a refrigerator with the inside of the house acting as the cold reservoir and the outside atmosphere acting as the hot reservoir. Assume that an air conditioner consumes $1.70 \times 10^3 \mathrm{~W}$ of electrical power, and that it can be idealized as a reversible Carnot refrigerator. If the coefficient of performance of this device is 3.30 , how much heat can be extracted from the house in a day?

C: 2.50 $10^8 \mathrm{~J}$
D: 6.00 $10^8 \mathrm{~J}$
E: 6.50 $10^8 \mathrm{~J}$
F: 3.20 $10^8 \mathrm{~J}$

Okay, so I have this physics problem about an air conditioner, and I'm a bit rusty on my thermodynamics, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the problem is asking.

The question says that an air conditioner is a refrigerator where the house is the cold reservoir and the outside is the hot reservoir. It operates as a reversible Carnot refrigerator, which I think means it's the most efficient possible for this setup. The electrical power it consumes is 1.70 x 10^3 W, and the coefficient of performance (COP) is 3.30. They want to know how much heat can be extracted from the house in a day.

Hmm, right, the coefficient of performance for a refrigerator is defined as the heat extracted from the cold reservoir divided by the work input. So COP = Q_cold / W. Since it's a Carnot refrigerator, the COP is given by the formula COP = T_cold / (T_hot - T_cold), where T_cold and T_hot are the absolute temperatures of the cold and hot reservoirs, respectively.

Wait, but maybe I don't need to worry about the temperatures since I have the COP already. The problem gives me the COP as 3.30. So I can use that directly without needing to calculate it from temperatures.

The power consumed is 1700 W, which is the work done per second. So the work input per second is 1700 J/s. But wait, actually, power is work per unit time, so the electrical power is the work done per second. So the work done per second (W) is 1700 J/s. 

Since COP = Q_cold / W, rearranging that gives Q_cold = COP * W. So the heat extracted per second would be 3.30 multiplied by the work done each second.

Let me calculate that. 3.30 * 1700 W. Let me compute that: 3.3 * 1700. Let me break it down: 3*1700=5100, and 0.3*1700=510. So adding them together, 5100 + 510 = 5610 J/s. So the rate at which heat is extracted is 5610 J per second.

Now, the question asks for the heat extracted in a day. A day has 24 hours, each hour has 60 minutes, each minute 60 seconds. So 24 * 60 * 60 = 86400 seconds in a day.

So the total heat extracted Q is 5610 J/s * 86400 s. Let me compute that. 5610 * 86400.

First, maybe simplify the calculation. Let's break it down:

5610 * 86400 = 5610 * (8.64 x 10^4) = 5610 * 8.64e4.

Wait, but 5610 is 5.61e3. So 5.61e3 * 8.64e4 = (5.61 * 8.64) x 1e7.

Let me calculate 5.61 * 8.64. Hmm.

5 * 8.64 = 43.2

0.61 * 8.64 = let's see: 0.6 *8.64=5.184, 0.01*8.64=0.0864. So 5.184 + 0.0864 = 5.2704.

So total is 43.2 + 5.2704 = 48.4704.

So 48.4704 x 1e7 J. That's 4.84704e8 J.

Wait, but let me double-check that calculation to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Alternatively, I can compute 5610 * 86400 directly.

Let me compute 5610 * 86400.

5610 * 86400 = 5610 * 8.64e4 = 5610 * 86400.

Alternatively, 5610 * 86400 = 5610 * (80000 + 6400) = 5610*80000 + 5610*6400.

5610 * 80000 = 5610 * 8e4 = 448800000 J.

5610 * 6400 = Let's compute 5610 * 6400.

5610 * 6000 = 33,660,000.

5610 * 400 = 2,244,000.

So 33,660,000 + 2,244,000 = 35,904,000.

Adding that to 448,800,000 gives 448,800,000 + 35,904,000 = 484,704,000 J.

So that's 4.84704e8 J, which matches my earlier calculation.

Looking at the options, option G is 4.85e8 J, which is very close. So the correct answer should be option G.
</think>

The air conditioner's coefficient of performance (COP) is given as 3.30, and it consumes 1700 W of power. The heat extracted per second is calculated as COP * power, which is 3.30 * 1700 = 5610 J/s. Over a day (86400 seconds), the total heat extracted is 5610 * 86400 = 4.84704e8 J, approximately 4.85e8 J.
