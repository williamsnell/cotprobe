Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these kinematics questions. Let's see what it says. The question is about a stone being thrown horizontally from a bridge, and I need to find out how long it takes to hit the water 80 meters below. Hmm, okay, so it's a projectile motion problem, right?

Alright, first things first, when something is thrown horizontally, its initial vertical velocity is zero. That makes sense because the throw is purely horizontal. So the stone doesn't start moving upward or downward; it just starts moving sideways. But gravity will affect it, causing it to accelerate downward. I remember that in projectile motion, the horizontal and vertical motions are independent of each other. Oh right, so the time it takes to fall doesn't depend on the horizontal speed. That's important because it means the time here can be calculated just by looking at the vertical motion.

So the stone is dropped (well, thrown horizontally) from a height of 80 meters. The vertical displacement (s) is -80 meters if I take upward as positive, but since I'm only concerned with the magnitude, maybe I can just use 80 meters. The initial vertical velocity (u) is 0 because it's thrown horizontally. The acceleration (a) is due to gravity, which is approximately 9.8 m/s² downward. Wait, but I should probably use 9.8 m/s², not 10, to be more accurate. Although sometimes 10 is used for simplicity, but maybe the problem expects 9.8 here. Hmm.

The formula I need to use is the one for displacement under constant acceleration. The equation is s = ut + (1/2) a t². Since u is zero, the equation simplifies to s = (1/2) a t². I can rearrange this to solve for time t. So t = sqrt(2s/a). Plugging in the numbers, s is 80 m, a is 9.8 m/s². So t = sqrt(2*80/9.8).

Let me calculate that. 2 times 80 is 160. 160 divided by 9.8 is approximately 16.3265. Taking the square root of that gives me roughly 4.04 seconds. Wait, that's about 4 seconds. Let me double-check the numbers to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 2*80=160, 160/9.8≈16.3265, sqrt(16.3265)=4.04. Yeah, that seems right.

Looking at the options, E is 4 seconds. So the answer should be E. But let me think again. Are there any other factors I'm missing? Oh, the problem says to assume air resistance is negligible, so that's good, I don't have to consider any drag. Also, since the stone is thrown horizontally, the horizontal speed doesn't affect the time it takes to fall, which I've correctly accounted for.

Wait a second, what if I used 10 m/s² instead of 9.8? Let me see. 2*80=160, 160/10=16, sqrt(16)=4. So that would also give me 4 seconds. Oh, so in that case, both 9.8 and 10 give the same answer in this case, which is why E is 4 s. So either way, the answer is E.

I think that's solid. So the time taken is about 4 seconds, so the correct option is E.

The problem involves calculating the time it takes for a stone to fall vertically 80 meters under gravity, ignoring air resistance. Using the kinematic equation for vertical displacement, the time is determined to be approximately 4 seconds. 

Answer: E
