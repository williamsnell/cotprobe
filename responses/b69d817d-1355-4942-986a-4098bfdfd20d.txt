Question:

TencerInc. has estimated its revenue function to be r(x) = 3x^2, where x is the number of years the company has been in business and r(x) is the total revenue earned up to year x in millions. The profit function is f(x) = 2x^2 - 5x +1, f(x) is the total profit earned up to year x. What is the cost accrued over a three year period? What is the rate of change of cost of production by the end of the third year?

Options:

A: $25 million, $12 million
B: $23 million, $11 million
C: $27 million, $13 million
D: $19 million, $10 million
E: $24 million, $13 million
F: $21 million, $9 million
G: $26 million, $14 million
H: $20 million, $10 million
I: $22 million, $11 million
J: $22 million, $12 million

Okay, so I've got this problem about TencerInc. and their revenue and profit functions. The question is asking about the cost accrued over a three-year period and the rate of change of cost at the end of the third year. Hmm, let me try to work through this step by step.

First, let me understand what the functions are. The revenue function is r(x) = 3x² where x is the number of years. And the profit function is f(x) = 2x² -5x +1. I remember that profit is revenue minus cost, so profit function f(x) = r(x) - c(x), where c(x) is the cost function. So, I can rearrange that to find c(x).

So, if f(x) is profit, then c(x) = r(x) - f(x). Let me compute that.

r(x) is 3x², and f(x) is 2x² -5x +1. So subtracting f(x) from r(x):

c(x) = (3x²) - (2x² -5x +1) 
= 3x² - 2x² +5x -1 
= x² +5x -1.

Wait, that makes sense. So the cost function is c(x) = x² +5x -1. 

Now, the question is about the cost over a three-year period. So I think that means the total cost after three years, which would be c(3). Let me compute that:

c(3) = (3)² +5*(3) -1 
= 9 +15 -1 
= 23 million. 

So the cost over three years is $23 million. Wait, but the options are about cost over a three-year period, which I think is the same as total cost after three years, so that's correct.

Next part is the rate of change of cost by the end of the third year. The rate of change would be the derivative of the cost function with respect to x evaluated at x=3. Let's find c'(x):

c(x) = x² +5x -1. 
c'(x) = 2x +5.

At x=3, c'(3) = 2*(3) +5 =6 +5=11 million dollars per year. So the rate is $11 million per year.

Wait, but let me double-check. Oh wait, the rate of change is the derivative, which is the instantaneous rate. So yes, at the end of year 3, the rate is 11 million per year. So looking back at the options, let's see.

Option B is $23 million and $11 million. That matches. Option B's first number is the total cost over three years, which is 23, and the rate is 11. So the answer should be option B. Let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation errors.

Wait, let me recalculate c(3):

3 squared is 9, 5 times 3 is 15. Subtract 1. So 9+15=24, 24-1=23. Yep, that's correct.

Derivative c'(x) is 2x+5. At x=3, 2*3=6 +5=11. So the rate is $11 million per year. So option B is correct.
</think>

The cost function is derived by subtracting the profit function from the revenue function: \( c(x) = r(x) - f(x) = 3x^2 - (2x^2 - 5x + 1) = x^2 + 5x - 1 \). 

The total cost over three years is \( c(3) = 3^2 + 5(3) - 1 = 9 + 15 - 1 = 23 \) million dollars.

The derivative of the cost function, \( c'(x) = 2x + 5 \), gives the instantaneous rate of change. At \( x = 3 \), \( c'(3) = 2(3) + 5 = 11 \) million dollars per year.

Thus, the cost over three years is $23 million, and the rate of change of cost at the end of the third year is $11 million. The correct answer is **B: $23 million, $11 million**.

Answer: B
