Okay, so I have this physics problem here about Young's experiment. Hmm, I remember that Young's experiment deals with the interference of light. The setup uses two slits and a screen where the interference pattern appears. The question is about finding the slit separation when the student can't see the interference fringes anymore. 

The problem states that the student is using a sodium vapor lamp as the light source, and the slits are 1 meter away from the screen. He varies the slit separation and notices that when they're too far apart, the interference pattern disappears. The key here is that his eye's angular resolution is 1 minute of arc. I think angular resolution refers to the smallest angle he can distinguish.

Wait, angular resolution... Right, human eyes typically have an angular resolution of about one arcminute, which is 1/60 of a degree. So that's the angle beyond which things blur together. In this case, the student can't see the interference fringes when the angle between the two bright fringes is smaller than his eye's resolution. Because if the fringes are too close together, he can't perceive them as separate, so the pattern vanishes.

I remember the formula for the position of bright fringes in Young's experiment. The formula is y = (λ * D) / d, where y is the distance from the center to the bright fringe, λ is the wavelength of the light, D is the distance from the slits to the screen, and d is the slit separation. But wait, maybe I should think in terms of angles instead.

Oh right, the angle θ is given by θ = λ / d. Because for the first bright fringe, the path difference is λ, so θ = λ / d. But wait, I think that's for small angles where sinθ ≈ tanθ ≈ θ in radians. So in this case, the angle between the two fringes would be twice θ, perhaps? Because each fringe is on either side of the central maximum. So the angle between the two first-order fringes would be 2θ = 2λ/d.

Wait, but the problem is about when the interference pattern disappears. That happens when the angle between adjacent fringes is smaller than the eye's resolution. So when 2λ/d becomes less than the eye's angular resolution. So setting 2λ/d = θ_eye.

So, solving for d, we get d = 2λ / θ_eye.

Wait, but I need to make sure about the units. Let's see, θ_eye is given in minutes of arc. One minute is 1/60 of a degree, and one degree is π/180 radians. So θ_eye = 1' = (1/60) degrees = (1/60) * (π/180) radians.

Calculating that: 1' = π/(60*180) = π/10800 radians.

Wait, but let's compute that numerically. π is approximately 3.1416, so π/10800 ≈ 3.1416/10800 ≈ 0.000291 radians.

But wait, I think the wavelength of sodium light is about 589 nm, which is 589e-9 meters.

So plugging into d = 2λ / θ_eye.

So d = 2 * 589e-9 m / (π/10800).

Let me compute that step by step.

First, calculate the denominator: π/10800 ≈ 3.1416 / 10800 ≈ 0.000291 radians.

So 2λ is 2 * 589e-9 = 1.178e-6 meters.

Now, d = (1.178e-6 m) / (0.000291) ≈ ?

Wait, let's compute that division: 1.178e-6 divided by 0.000291.

Wait, 1.178e-6 / 0.000291 = (1.178 / 0.291) * 1e-6 / 1e-4 = (4.048) * 1e-2 = approximately 0.04048 meters? Wait, that can't be right because the options are in mm, so 0.04 meters is 4 cm, which is way too big. That must be wrong because the slit separation is usually a fraction of a millimeter in Young's experiments, not centimeters.

Wait, maybe I messed up the units somewhere. Let me recheck the units.

Wait, wait a second. The formula I used might be incorrect. Let me think again.

In Young's experiment, the condition for constructive interference is d sinθ = mλ, where m is the order (m=1 for the first bright fringe). So the angle θ is given by θ = arcsin(mλ/d). For small angles, this is approximately θ ≈ mλ/d. So the angle between two adjacent fringes would be the difference in θ between m=1 and m=0, but I think more accurately, the angle between the m=1 fringes on either side is 2θ, where θ is approximately λ/d.

Wait, but wait, when m=0, it's the central maximum. The first maxima are at m=1 and m=-1, so the angle between them would be 2θ, where θ is λ/d. So the angle between the two first-order maxima is 2λ/d.

But the student's eye can't resolve this angle if it's smaller than his angular resolution. So when 2λ/d equals the eye's resolution θ_eye, that's when he can't see the fringes anymore. So 2λ/d = θ_eye.

So d = 2λ / θ_eye.

Wait, that's the same formula as before. So let's compute it again, perhaps I made an error in calculations.

θ_eye is 1 minute of arc, which is 1/60 degree. Let's convert that to radians.

1 degree = π/180 radians.

So 1' = (1/60) * π/180 = π/(60*180) = π/10800 radians. So approximately 3.1416 / 10800 ≈ 0.000291 radians.

Wavelength λ is 589 nm, which is 589e-9 meters.

So d = 2 * 589e-9 m / 0.000291.

Compute numerator: 2 * 589e-9 = 1.178e-6 m.

Denominator: 0.000291.

So 1.178e-6 / 0.000291 = (1.178 / 0.291) * 1e-6 / 1e-4.

Wait, 1e-6 / 1e-4 is 1e-2, so 0.01.

1.178 / 0.291 ≈ 4.048.

So 4.048 * 0.01 ≈ 0.04048 meters, which is 40.48 mm. But that's way too big because the options are all under 5 mm. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I inverted the formula. Let me think again. When does the interference pattern vanish? I think it's when the angle between the two first maxima is equal to the eye's resolution. So when 2λ/d = θ_eye, then d = 2λ / θ_eye.

But perhaps I should be using the formula for the limit of resolution, which is when the angle equals the resolving power. Alternatively, sometimes the resolving angle is given as θ = 1.22 λ / d, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe I should use the formula for the diffraction angle in a different way.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the first minimum in the diffraction pattern, but no, this is about interference, not diffraction. Wait, no, the question is about interference fringes.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the condition for the fringes to be just resolvable. The resolving power is such that the angle between the fringes is at least the eye's resolution. So when the angle is smaller than that, the fringes can't be seen.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the units. Let me check again.

Wait, 1' is 1/60 degree, which is 0.0166667 degrees. To convert to radians, 0.0166667 * π/180 ≈ 0.000290888 radians.

Hmm, that's correct.

Wait, but maybe I should calculate the denominator correctly. Let's compute 2λ / θ_eye.

So 2 * 589e-9 m is 1.178e-6 m.

Divided by 0.000290888 radians gives:

1.178e-6 / 0.000290888 ≈ 0.00405 meters, which is 4.05 mm.

Wait, that's 4.05 mm, which is option G: 4.025 mm. Hmm, but wait, I thought the options were smaller. Let me check the options again.

Options are from A:3.025 mm up to I:4.525 mm. So 4.05 mm is close to option G, which is 4.025 mm. But wait, the calculation I did just now is about 4.05 mm, which is near 4.025 mm. But earlier I thought the options were in the 2 mm range, but perhaps I was confusing it with something else.

Wait, but in my initial calculations, I get d ≈ 4.05 mm. But looking back, the options include G:4.025 mm. So perhaps that's the answer. But wait, I'm a bit confused because I thought the slit separation in Young's experiments is usually on the order of micrometers to hundreds of micrometers. But maybe in this problem, it's designed to have a larger slit separation.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the formula. Another approach is to consider the formula for the fringe width on the screen:

β = (λ D) / d, where β is the fringe width on the screen. The angular width would be β/D, which is λ/d.

Wait, wait, because β = y = (λ D) / d. So the angle θ is y/D = λ/d. So the angle between two fringes would be 2θ = 2λ/d.

Wait, so when 2λ/d equals the eye's angular resolution θ_eye, the fringes just become unresolvable. So 2λ/d = θ_eye, so d = 2λ / θ_eye.

So yes, that's the same formula as before.

So plugging the numbers again:

λ = 589e-9 m.

θ_eye = 1' = π/(10800) ≈ 0.000290888 radians.

d = 2 * 589e-9 / 0.000290888.

Compute numerator: 2 * 589e-9 = 1.178e-6 m.

d = 1.178e-6 / 0.000290888 ≈ 0.00405 m = 4.05 mm.

Looking at the options, option G is 4.025 mm, which is very close. So the answer would be G.

Wait, but wait another thought: perhaps I should use the exact value for 1 minute of arc as θ_eye.

Wait, 1 minute is 1/60 degree, which is (1/60) * (π/180) radians. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute it as degrees to radians more accurately.

Let me compute θ_eye more precisely.

1 degree = π/180 ≈ 0.0174533 radians.

So 1' = 1/60 degree = 0.01666667 degrees.

In radians, that's 0.01666667 * 0.0174533 ≈ 0.000290888 radians. So that's correct.

So d = 2 * 589e-9 / 0.000290888 ≈ 4.05 mm.

Looking at the options, option G is 4.025 mm, which is the closest. So maybe that's the intended answer.

Wait, but wait another thing: perhaps the problem uses the approximate value for sodium light's wavelength as 590 nm instead of 589 nm. Let me check the calculation with 590 nm.

d = 2 * 590e-9 / 0.000290888 ≈ (1.18e-6) / 0.000290888 ≈ 4.06 mm.

Still around 4.05 mm, so G is the closest.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D is 2.525 mm, which is about half of that. Did I miss a factor of 2 somewhere?

Wait, another possibility: perhaps I should have used θ = λ/d, not 2λ/d. Because maybe the angle between the central maximum and the first fringe is λ/d, so when that angle is less than θ_eye/2, the fringes aren't visible. Hmm, but that approach would lead to a smaller d.

Wait, but the condition for the fringes to be visible is that the angle between adjacent fringes is larger than the eye's resolution. So the angle between two fringes is 2λ/d. So when 2λ/d = θ_eye, that's when the fringes are just resolvable. If the slit separation is larger, making d bigger, the angle 2λ/d would be smaller than θ_eye, so the fringes would not be visible. So the maximum d beyond which the fringes disappear is when 2λ/d = θ_eye, so d = 2λ/θ_eye.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem is considering the angle from the center to a fringe as θ = λ/d, and when that angle is less than θ_eye, the fringes can't be seen. So in that case, the condition would be θ = λ/d < θ_eye, so d > λ/θ_eye. But that would give a d of approximately 2.025 mm when using λ=589e-9 m and θ_eye=0.000290888 rad.

Because d = λ/θ_eye = 589e-9 / 0.000290888 ≈ 0.002025 m, which is 2.025 mm, option C.

Wait, that's a different result. So now I'm confused. Which approach is correct?

I think I need to clarify whether the angle between fringes is 2θ or θ. The central maximum is at θ=0, and the first maxima are at θ=±θ0, where θ0≈λ/d. So the angle between the two first maxima is 2θ0 = 2λ/d. Therefore, the angular separation between adjacent fringes is 2λ/d. 

So the condition for the fringes to be visible is that this separation is greater than the eye's angular resolution. So when 2λ/d > θ_eye, the fringes are visible. When 2λ/d = θ_eye, that's the threshold. Beyond that (when d increases, making 2λ/d smaller), the fringes are not visible.

So the maximum slit separation d for which the fringes are just visible is when 2λ/d = θ_eye, so d = 2λ/θ_eye.

But earlier, using that formula, I got d≈4.05 mm, which is option G.

But wait, the options don't have exactly 4.05 mm. The closest is G:4.025 mm.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let's compute 2λ/θ_eye more accurately.

λ = 589 nm = 589e-9 m.

θ_eye = 1' = π/(10800) ≈ 0.000290888 radians.

So 2λ = 2 * 589e-9 = 1.178e-6 m.

d = 1.178e-6 / 0.000290888 ≈ 4.05 mm.

But let me compute it precisely.

Compute 1.178e-6 / 0.000290888.

First, 1.178e-6 is 0.000001178.

Divided by 0.000290888.

So 0.000001178 / 0.000290888 = (1.178 / 290.888) * 1e-4.

Wait, 1.178 / 290.888 ≈ 0.00405.

So 0.00405 meters is 4.05 mm.

So option G is 4.025 mm, which is very close. So perhaps that's the intended answer.

But wait, looking at the options, the closest is G:4.025 mm. So the answer should be G.

But wait, earlier I thought the options were all under 3 mm, but no, option G is 4.025 mm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different wavelength. Sodium light is often approximated as about 589 nm, but sometimes taken as 590 nm or 580 nm. Let me try with λ=590 nm.

λ=590e-9 m.

d = 2 * 590e-9 / 0.000290888 = 1.18e-6 / 0.000290888 ≈ 4.06 mm. Still around 4.05, so G is correct.

But wait, perhaps I should check if the student is at the slit setup, and the distance to the screen is 1 m, does that affect the calculation? I don't think so because the formula for d is based on the angle, which is independent of the screen distance D. Because the formula for d is derived from the angle, which depends on λ and d.

Wait, the formula I used is d = 2λ/θ_eye. The screen distance D only comes into play when calculating the actual position y of the fringes (y=λ D/d), but for the angular separation, D doesn't matter.

So yes, the slit separation d is determined by the wavelength, the eye's angular resolution, and the formula d=2λ/θ_eye.

Therefore, the correct answer should be G:4.025 mm.
</think>

The problem involves determining the slit separation \( d \) in a Young's experiment when the interference fringes just disappear due to the student's angular resolution of 1 minute of arc. The key formula used is:

\[
d = \frac{2\lambda}{\theta_{\text{eye}}}
\]

### Step 1: Convert the angular resolution to radians
The student's angular resolution is \( \theta_{\text{eye}} = 1' \) (1 minute of arc). Converting to radians:

\[
\theta_{\text{eye}} = \frac{1}{60} \, \text{degree} = \frac{1}{60} \times \frac{\pi}{180} \, \text{radians} = \frac{\pi}{10800} \, \text{radians} \approx 0.000290888 \, \text{radians}.
\]

### Step 2: Use the wavelength of sodium light
The wavelength of sodium light is approximately \( \lambda = 589 \, \text{nm} = 589 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m} \).

### Step 3: Calculate the slit separation \( d \)
Substituting into the formula:

\[
d = \frac{2 \times 589 \times 10^{-9}}{0.000290888} \approx \frac{1.178 \times 10^{-6}}{0.000290888} \approx 0.00405 \, \text{m} = 4.05 \, \text{mm}.
\]

### Step 4: Match with the closest option
The calculated value of \( d \approx 4.05 \, \text{mm} \) is closest to option **G: 4.025 mm**. Therefore, the slit separation when the interference fringes just disappear is approximately **4.025 mm**.

**Answer: G**
