Okay, so I've got this logic problem to solve. It's about constructing a truth table for a given argument and then determining whether the argument is valid or invalid. If it's invalid, I need to pick a counterexample from the options provided.

The argument is given as two statements: 

1. ~G ⊃ H
2. ~H / G

I think the second part is saying that if ~H is true, then G must be true. So the argument is structured as ~G implies H, and from ~H we conclude G. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me parse it again. The first premise is ~G implies H. The second line is ~H divided by (I think that's the division sign, maybe indicating a conclusion) G. So the argument is: If not G then H, and if not H, then G. Hmm, that seems a bit confusing.

Wait, maybe the second part is the conclusion. So the argument is: Premise 1 is ~G ⊃ H, and Premise 2 is ~H, leading to the conclusion G. So the argument is: If ~G then H, and if not H, therefore G. So in logical terms, it's structured as:

1. ~G → H
2. ~H
Therefore, G.

To check the validity, I need to construct a truth table for all possible truth values of G and H. Since there are two variables, G and H, there are four possible combinations: both true, G true H false, G false H true, and both false.

Let me list them out:

1. G = T, H = T
2. G = T, H = F
3. G = F, H = T
4. G = F, H = F

Now, for each row, I'll compute the truth values of the premises and the conclusion.

The argument is valid only if whenever both premises are true, the conclusion is also true. If there's any row where both premises are true and the conclusion is false, the argument is invalid, and that row provides a counterexample.

So let's go step by step.

First, let's list all possible rows.

1. G=T, H=T
   - ~G = F
   - Premise 1: ~G → H = F → T = T (because in logic, F→anything is T)
   - Premise 2: ~H = F
   - Conclusion: G = T. Since the conclusion is T, but Premise 2 is F, this row doesn't affect the validity because for the argument to be invalid, we need a case where both premises are T and conclusion F.

2. G=T, H=F
   - ~G = F
   - Premise 1: ~G→H = F→F = T
   - Premise 2: ~H = T
   - Conclusion: G = T
   So here, both premises are T, and conclusion is T. So no issue here.

3. G=F, H=T
   - ~G = T
   - Premise 1: T→T = T
   - Premise 2: ~H = F
   - Conclusion: G=F. So conclusion is F. But since Premise 2 is F, this row doesn't make the premises both true. So no problem.

4. G=F, H=F
   - ~G = T
   - Premise 1: T→F = F (because T→F is F)
   - Premise 2: ~H = T
   - Conclusion: G=F
   So here, Premise 1 is F, Premise 2 is T. Since Premise 1 is F, the premises aren't both true, so no issue.

Wait, but I might have made a mistake. Let me check each row again.

Wait, the argument is: Premise 1 is ~G→H, Premise 2 is ~H, and conclusion is G.

So in each row, I need to check if both premises are true, and see if conclusion is true.

Let me go through each row:

Row 1: G=T, H=T
- ~G=F, ~H=F
- Premise 1: F→T = T
- Premise 2: F
- Conclusion: T
Since Premise 2 is F, it doesn't matter; the argument isn't claiming anything when Premise 2 is F.

Row 2: G=T, H=F
- ~G=F, ~H=T
- Premise 1: F→F = T
- Premise 2: T
- Conclusion: G=T
Here, both premises are T, and conclusion is T. So no problem.

Row 3: G=F, H=T
- ~G=T, ~H=F
- Premise 1: T→T = T
- Premise 2: F
- Conclusion: F
Again, since Premise 2 is F, not both premises are T, so no problem.

Row 4: G=F, H=F
- ~G=T, ~H=T
- Premise 1: T→F = F
- Premise 2: T
- Conclusion: F
Here, Premise 1 is F and Premise 2 is T. So both premises are not T; Premise 1 is F, so no issue.

Wait, so in all rows, whenever both premises are T, the conclusion is T. But wait, in which row are both premises T?

Looking again:

Row 1: Premise 2 is F, so not both T.

Row 2: Premise 1 is T, Premise 2 is T. So both premises are T here.

In Row 2: G=T, H=F.

Conclusion is G=T, which is T. So in the only row where both premises are T, the conclusion is also T.

Therefore, the argument is valid because there's no case where both premises are true and the conclusion is false.

Wait, but looking at the options, option I says "Valid". So the answer would be I.

But wait, let me double-check because sometimes I might have misread the problem.

Wait, the argument is: ~G→H as premise 1, and ~H as premise 2, leading to G as conclusion.

So the structure is: If ~G then H, and if not H, then G. So the argument is: ~G→H, ~H therefore G.

Is that a valid argument?

Wait, another way to think: Let's see if the premises entail the conclusion.

In logic, the argument is valid if in every possible scenario where the premises are true, the conclusion is also true.

So in this case, when is premise 1 (~G→H) true and premise 2 (~H) true?

Premise 1: ~G→H is false only when ~G is T and H is F. So when G is F and H is F, premise 1 is F.

So when are both premises true?

Premise 2 is ~H, which is T when H is F.

So when H is F, premise 2 is T. Now, for premise 1 to be T when H is F, ~G→H must be T. Since H is F, ~G must be F (because F→F is T, but T→F is F). So for ~G→H to be T when H is F, ~G must be F, which means G is T.

So the only row where both premises are T is when G is T and H is F.

In that case, conclusion is G=T, which is T. So yes, in the only row where both premises are T, the conclusion is T. Therefore, the argument is valid.

Wait, but looking at the options, option I says "Valid". So the answer should be I. But wait, let me check the options again.

The options are:

A: Invalid. Counterexample when G is false and H is true
B: Invalid. Counterexample when G is true and H is true
C: Valid, with G and H both being variable
D: Invalid. Counterexample when G and H are true
E: Invalid. Counterexample when G is true and H is false
F: Invalid. Counterexample when both G and H are false
G: Invalid. Counterexample when G is false and H is false
H: Invalid. Counterexample when H is true and G is false
I: Valid

Wait, but according to my analysis, the argument is valid, so the answer would be I. But looking at the options, I is "Valid".

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I remember that in logic, the argument ~G→H and ~H ⊢ G is actually valid. Because from ~G→H, if we have ~H, we can conclude G via contraposition.

Wait, let me think about contraposition. The contrapositive of ~G→H is ~H→G. So if we have ~G→H as a premise, then ~H→G is equivalent, so if we have ~H as another premise, we can conclude G. So yes, the argument is valid.

So the answer should be I.

But wait, the initial problem says "construct a complete truth table". Let me recheck by building the entire table.

Let me list all four rows with G and H:

1. G=T, H=T
2. G=T, H=F
3. G=F, H=T
4. G=F, H=F

For each, compute:

Premise 1: ~G→H

Premise 2: ~H

Conclusion: G

So:

Row 1: G=T, H=T
~G=F, ~H=F
Premise1: F→T = T
Premise2: F
Conclusion: T
Since Premise2 is F, this row doesn't apply.

Row 2: G=T, H=F
~G=F, ~H=T
Premise1: F→F = T
Premise2: T
Conclusion: T
Here, both premises are T, conclusion is T.

Row 3: G=F, H=T
~G=T, ~H=F
Premise1: T→T = T
Premise2: F
Conclusion: F
Since Premise2 is F, no issue.

Row 4: G=F, H=F
~G=T, ~H=T
Premise1: T→F = F
Premise2: T
Conclusion: F
Here, Premise1 is F, so both premises aren't T.

So, the only row where both premises are T is Row 2, and in that case, conclusion is T. Therefore, no counterexample exists; the argument is valid.

So the correct answer is I: Valid.
</think>

The argument is valid because in the only scenario where both premises are true, the conclusion is also true.
