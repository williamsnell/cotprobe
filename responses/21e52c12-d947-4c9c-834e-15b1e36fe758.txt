B: Influenza
C: Pertussis
D: Poliomyelitis

Okay, so I've got this question about a child having an allergic reaction after eating an egg, and it's asking about a vaccination risk for hypersensitivity. Hmm. Let's break it down.

The child is 13 months old and had urticaria, swelling lips, and difficulty breathing after eating an egg. These are classic signs of an allergic reaction, possibly anaphylaxis. Now, the question is about a potential risk from a vaccination. So I need to think about which vaccines are made using eggs or might cause hypersensitivity in egg-allergic individuals.

Looking at the options:

A: Hepatitis. I think the Hepatitis A vaccine is made in cells, so it's not using eggs. Hepatitis B is recombinant, so probably not egg-based. So maybe A isn't the right choice.

B: Influenza. The flu vaccine, especially the trivalent and quadrivalent ones, are often grown in chicken eggs. People with egg allergies are usually warned about the flu shot because of this. So this seems like a possible candidate.

C: Pertussis. The pertussis vaccine, like DTaP, is usually made using bacteria cultures, not eggs. So I don't think this is the one.

D: Poliomyelitis. The oral polio vaccine is live-attenuated and grown in monkey kidney cells, I believe. The inactivated version is also not egg-based. So D probably isn't the answer.

Wait, but there's also the MMR vaccine, which is measles, mumps, and rubella. That's grown in chicken embryo cells, so if the child had MMR, could that be a risk? But the question is about the potential risk from a specific vaccine listed. The options don't include MMR, though. The options are Hepatitis, Influenza, Pertussis, Poliomyelitis.

So focusing on the options given, Influenza is the one that's often egg-based. Therefore, the risk is posed by the Influenza vaccination. So the answer should be B.

The child's reaction suggests an allergic response to eggs, and the question asks about a vaccination risk. The flu vaccine is often grown in chicken eggs, posing a hypersensitivity risk for egg-allergic individuals. Other vaccines listed (Hepatitis, Pertussis, Poliomyelitis) are not typically egg-based. Thus, the correct answer is:

B

The last character of my response is B.
