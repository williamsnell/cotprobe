Okay, so I've got this question about the 31P NMR spectrum of a sodium phosphate solution. The question says that there's a single line observed, which probably means that all the phosphorus is in the same environment. The chemical shifts given are for H2PO4^- at 3.42 ppm and HPO4^2- at 5.82 ppm. The question asks what the chemical shift would be when the pH of the solution equals the pKa of H2PO4^-.

Hmm, I remember that in solution, phosphate exists in different forms depending on the pH. The pKa values for the phosphate ion are important here. Phosphate has three pKa values because it's a triprotic acid. The first pKa is around 2.15, the second around 7.20, and the third around 12.35. Wait, wait, I might have mixed those up. Let me think again. Oh right, the first dissociation is H3PO4 → H2PO4^- + H+, pKa1 ≈2.15. The second is H2PO4^- ↔ HPO4^2- + H+, pKa2≈7.20. The third is HPO4^2- ↔ PO4^3- + H+, pKa3≈12.35.

So in the solution, the pH is equal to pKa2 of H2PO4^-, which is 7.20. Wait, the pKa of H2PO4^- would be pKa2, which is 7.20. So when the pH equals pKa2, the solution is at the midpoint of the second dissociation. 

At pH = pKa, the concentration of the acid and its conjugate base are equal. So at pH 7.20, the concentration of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- would be the same. But wait, the question is about the 31P NMR chemical shift. 

In the NMR, each species (like H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-) has a distinct chemical shift. If both are present in equal amounts, would the NMR signal be an average of the two shifts? Or would it be a single line due to some other reason?

Wait, but in the question, the solution is sodium phosphate. Sodium phosphate is NaH2PO4, which would dissociate into Na+ and H2PO4^- in solution. But when you have a solution of a diprotic acid like H2PO4^-, it can lose a proton to form HPO4^2-. So the pH will determine which species is predominant.

At pH equal to pKa2, which is about 7.20, the concentration of H2PO4^- equals that of HPO4^2-.

Wait, but the question says that the solution has a single line in the 31P NMR. That suggests that all the phosphate is in one form. So maybe at pH equal to pKa2, the solution is a 50:50 mixture of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

But wait, in NMR, if two different environments are present, you would see two separate peaks. But the question says there's a single line. Hmm, that's confusing. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the setup.

Wait, the question states that the solution is sodium phosphate. Sodium phosphate is NaH2PO4, which is the dihydrate, NaH2PO4·2H2O. So when it dissolves in water, it dissociates into Na+ and H2PO4^-.

But depending on the pH, H2PO4^- can deprotonate to form HPO4^2-. So if the solution is at pH equal to pKa2 (7.20), the H2PO4^- will be 50% deprotonated to HPO4^2-.

Wait, but then in the NMR, you would have both species present. So why is there a single line? Maybe because in solution, the phosphate exists as a mixture but due to rapid exchange between the two forms on the NMR timescale, the peaks broaden into a single averaged peak. Alternatively, perhaps the solution is at a pH where only one species is present, but that contradicts the thought that at pKa, both are present.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The question says that the pH equals the pKa of H2PO4^-. So that's pKa2, which is around 7.20. So in solution, the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are equal. So the chemical shift would be an average of the two shifts, because each species contributes equally.

So the chemical shift would be the average of 3.42 ppm and 5.82 ppm. Let's calculate that: (3.42 +5.82)/2 = (9.24)/2 =4.62 ppm.

Looking at the options, option H is 4.62 ppm. So that's the correct answer.

The question involves determining the 31P NMR chemical shift of a sodium phosphate solution when the pH equals the pKa of H2PO4^-. Phosphate exists in different forms depending on the pH, with pKa values approximately at 2.15, 7.20, and 12.35 for the three dissociation steps. At pH equal to pKa2 (7.20), the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are equal.

In the 31P NMR spectrum, each species (H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-) has a distinct chemical shift: 3.42 ppm for H2PO4^- and 5.82 ppm for HPO4^2-. At pH 7.20, since both species are present in equal amounts, the chemical shift observed is the average of the two shifts. Calculating the average:

\[
\text{Chemical shift} = \frac{3.42 + 5.82}{2} = \frac{9.24}{2} = 4.62 \, \text{ppm}.
\]

Thus, the chemical shift at pH equal to pKa2 is 4.62 ppm, corresponding to option H.
