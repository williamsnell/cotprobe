Answer:
    
<think>
Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to understand what's being asked. The problem is about equilibrium calculations for the reaction H2(g) + I2(g) ⇌ 2HI(g). We're given the equilibrium constant Kp at 25°C, which is 870. There are two parts to the problem, (a) and (b), each requiring me to calculate the number of moles at equilibrium under different initial conditions.

Starting with part (a): We're told that when H2 is 0.5 moles and I2 is 0.5 moles, we need to find how much HI is formed. I think this involves setting up an ICE table (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) to track the changes in moles as the reaction proceeds towards equilibrium.

Wait, but wait. The problem says "calculate the number of moles of the following at equilibrium." For part (a), it's HI formed when H2 and I2 are each 0.5 moles. Hmm, but I need to clarify the setup. Are these initial moles, or are they at equilibrium? Probably initial, because we're being asked what's formed from those starting amounts.

So, for part (a), the initial moles are H2 = 0.5, I2 = 0.5, and HI is 0, since it's formed from the reaction. Let me write that down.

Reaction: H2 + I2 ⇌ 2HI
Initial moles: [H2] = 0.5, [I2] = 0.5, [HI] = 0
Change: Let's say the change is +x for H2 and I2 (since they're reactants, their moles decrease), and +2x for HI (since it's a product). So the change would be:
H2: -x
I2: -x
HI: +2x

At equilibrium, the moles would be:
[H2] = 0.5 - x
[I2] = 0.5 - x
[HI] = 0 + 2x = 2x

Now, since Kp is given as 870, which is a large value, indicating the reaction favors products. But wait, Kp is usually calculated using partial pressures, but here we're dealing with moles. Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of concentrations, but since it's a gaseous reaction, perhaps partial pressures are more appropriate. Alternatively, assuming ideal behavior and using mole fractions, but maybe using the reaction quotient in terms of partial pressures.

Wait, another thought: Since the reaction is in a gaseous state and assuming the volume is constant, we can use the mole fractions to find the partial pressures. But maybe it's easier to express Kp in terms of mole fractions, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps using the reaction quotient based on partial pressures, each expressed as (moles / volume) for each gas.

Wait, but let's think without volume. Maybe it's better to express Kp in terms of the mole fractions, assuming the volume is the same for all gases, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps Kp will be expressed as (P_HI)^2 / (P_H2 * P_I2). But without knowing the volume, it's tricky because partial pressure is (mole fraction) * total pressure. Hmm, but maybe we can express the partial pressures in terms of moles, assuming a fixed volume and total pressure.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to let the change be in terms of moles, but then the partial pressures would be proportional to the number of moles, assuming the volume is constant. So, if the volume is V, then the partial pressure of each gas is (moles/V) * R T, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps we can consider the reaction quotient in terms of the mole fractions, but I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Another approach: Let me consider the initial moles. Suppose the container has a volume V. Then the initial partial pressures are:

P_H2_initial = (0.5 / V) * R T
P_I2_initial = (0.5 / V) * R T
P_HI_initial = 0

After the reaction, the moles change by x, so the partial pressures would be:

P_H2 = (0.5 - x)/ V * R T
P_I2 = (0.5 - x)/ V * R T
P_HI = (2x)/V * R T

Then Kp = (P_HI)^2 / (P_H2 * P_I2) = 870

Substituting the expressions:

[(2x/(V R T))^2] / [ ( (0.5 - x)/(V R T) ) * ( (0.5 - x)/(V R T) ) ) ] = 870

Wait, let's simplify this. Let me compute numerator and denominator.

Numerator: (2x/V R T)^2 = (4x²)/(V² R² T²)
Denominator: [ (0.5 - x)/ (V R T) ) ]² = ( (0.5 -x)^2 ) / (V² R² T² )

So Kp = [4x²/(V² R² T²)] / [ (0.5 -x)^2 / (V² R² T²) ) ] = 4x² / (0.5 - x)^2 = 870

So, 4x² / (0.5 - x)^2 = 870.

Taking square roots on both sides:

2x/(0.5 -x) = sqrt(870) ≈ 29.496

So, 2x = 29.496 (0.5 - x)

Let me compute that:

2x = 29.496*(0.5) - 29.496 x
2x = 14.748 -29.496 x

Bring all x terms to left:

2x +29.496 x =14.748

31.496 x ≈14.748

x ≈14.748 /31.496 ≈0.468

So x is approximately 0.468 moles.

Wait, but let's check if this makes sense. If x is 0.468, then the moles of H2 and I2 at equilibrium would be 0.5-0.468=0.032 each. But let's check if this is possible, because if x is 0.468, then [H2] and [I2] are 0.032. But Kp is 870, which is large, so the reaction favors products, so x is high. So 0.468 seems plausible.

So, the moles of HI at equilibrium would be 2x = 2*0.468=0.936 moles.

Wait, but the initial H2 and I2 were each 0.5 mol. So x can't be more than 0.5, but 0.468 is fine.

So for part (a), the moles of HI formed would be 0.936, and the moles of I2 remaining would be 0.5 -0.468=0.032. Wait, but looking at the options, option B says 0.936 moles of HI and 0.010 moles of I2. Hmm, so 0.032 isn't matching any option. Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, let me double-check the algebra.

I had 4x²/(0.5 -x)^2 =870.

Taking square root gives 2x/(0.5 -x) = sqrt(870)=29.496.

Then,

2x = 29.496*(0.5 -x)
2x =14.748 -29.496x

Adding 29.496x to both sides:

31.496x =14.748

x=14.748 /31.496 ≈0.468.

So x=0.468, so [H2]=0.5-0.468=0.032, [I2]=0.032, [HI]=0.936.

Wait, but the problem says "no solid iodine forms," which probably refers to part (b), maybe. Or perhaps it's just a condition that all substances are in gaseous form, so no solids are present. So, in part (a), the initial I2 is 0.5 moles, so after reaction, it's 0.032, which is positive, so no problem.

Looking at the options for part (a), let's see which option matches 0.936 moles of HI and 0.032 moles of I2. But none of the options have 0.032. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A: HI=1.000, I2=0 → no, too high.

B: HI=0.936, I2=0.010 → I2 is 0.010, which is close to 0.032 but not exact.

C: HI=0.750, I2=0.125 → no.

D: HI=0.468, I2=0.010 → no.

E: HI=0.500, I2=0.200 → no.

F: HI=0.936, I2=0.005 → closer, but not matching.

G: HI=0.800, I2=0.100 → no.

H: HI=0.700, I2=0.150 → no.

I: HI=0.468, I2=0.005 → no.

J: HI=0.250, I2=0.250 → no.

Hmm, none of the options have 0.936 and 0.032. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, maybe I made an error in the setup. Let me re-examine the problem.

Wait, the problem states that K_p is 870. So when I set up the expression, perhaps I should consider that Kp is in terms of partial pressures, but maybe I should use concentrations instead. Alternatively, perhaps the Kp is given as Kc, but the problem says Kp, so I must use partial pressures.

Wait, another approach: Let me let the change be 'x', and express the partial pressures in terms of x, assuming the volume is V and temperature T is constant.

But maybe, since the volume is not given, perhaps the Kp is expressed in terms of mole fractions, but it's getting complicated.

Wait, perhaps the approach is correct, but the options have a different value for I2. Let me see: if x=0.468, then I2 is 0.5 -0.468=0.032, but perhaps when rounding, 0.032 can be approximated as 0.03, but looking at the options, option B has I2=0.010, which is 0.01, which is much lower than 0.032. So maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Let me try another approach.

Let me consider that the reaction is H2 + I2 ⇌ 2HI, and the initial moles are H2=0.5, I2=0.5, HI=0.

At equilibrium, moles are H2=0.5 -x, I2=0.5 -x, HI=2x.

The Kp expression is (P_HI)^2 / (P_H2 * P_I2) = 870.

Assuming ideal gas behavior, and the volume is V, and temperature is T, the partial pressures can be expressed as (moles/V)*R*T.

So,

P_H2 = (0.5 -x)RT/V,

P_I2 = (0.5 -x) RT/V,

P_HI = (2x) RT/V.

Substituting into Kp:

[ (2x RT/V )^2 ] / [ (0.5 -x)^2 (RT/V)^2 ) ] = 870.

Simplify numerator and denominator:

Numerator: (4x² (RT/V)^2 )

Denominator: (0.5 -x)^2 (RT/V)^2 )

The (RT/V)^2 terms cancel out, giving:

4x² / (0.5 -x)^2 =870.

Which is the same as before. So, the setup is correct.

So taking sqrt(870)=29.496,

2x/(0.5 -x) =29.496,

So,

2x =29.496*(0.5 -x),

2x=14.748 -29.496 x,

31.496 x=14.748,

x=14.748/31.496≈0.468.

So x≈0.468.

Thus, [HI]=2x=0.936, [I2]=0.5 -0.468=0.032.

But the options don't have 0.032. So perhaps I made a mistake in the problem's part identification. Let me check the problem statement again.

Wait, the question has two parts, (a) and (b). Part (a) is about HI formed when H2=0.5 and I2=0.5. Part (b) is about I2 formed when H2=0.5 and HI=1.5.

Wait, perhaps part (a) is calculated correctly, but none of the options match. Let me look at the options again.

Looking at option F: HI=0.936, I2=0.005 → which is close, but I2 is 0.005, lower than 0.032.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the algebra.

Wait, 2x/(0.5 -x)=29.496.

Let me solve for x again.

2x =29.496*(0.5 -x)

Expanding the right side: 29.496 *0.5 =14.748; 29.496*(-x)= -29.496x.

So equation becomes:

2x =14.748 -29.496 x

Adding 29.496x to both sides:

2x +29.496x =14.748 →31.496x=14.748 →x=14.748/31.496 ≈0.468.

Same result. So perhaps the correct answer isn't in the options, but looking back, perhaps part (a) is the first part, and part (b) is the second. Maybe I'm looking for part (a) first.

Wait, the options are for both (a) and (b). Let me look at each option.

Option B: HI=0.936, I2=0.010 → For part (a), but [I2] would be 0.5 -x=0.032, not 0.010. So perhaps this isn't correct. Alternatively, perhaps the problem has a typo, but more likely I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I should think about using Kc instead of Kp, but the problem says Kp is 870. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction quotient is based on concentrations, not partial pressures. But the problem specifies Kp, so I must use partial pressures.

Wait, maybe the problem is in the way the reaction is written. Let me check:

The reaction is H2(g) + I2(g) ⇌ 2HI(g).

So, the stoichiometry is correct. Moles change by x for H2 and I2, and 2x for HI.

Another thought: Maybe I should consider that the problem uses Kp with respect to a standard pressure (like 1 atm), so perhaps the partial pressures are calculated differently.

Alternatively, perhaps I should assume that the total pressure is 1 atm, but that might complicate things further.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the reaction is in a container where the total pressure is 1 atm, but without knowing the volume, it's difficult. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the use of concentrations, but given that Kp is provided, I think I should stick with partial pressures.

Wait, let me try to compute Kp using the given x.

If x=0.468, then Kp would be (0.936)^2 / (0.032)^2 → (0.876)/(0.001024)≈856. Which is close to 870, but not exact. So perhaps x is a little higher.

Let me refine the calculation. Let me set up the equation again:

4x²/(0.5 -x)^2 =870.

Let me take the equation as:

(2x/(0.5 -x))^2 =870.

So,

2x/(0.5 -x) = sqrt(870) ≈29.496.

Let me solve this accurately.

Let me denote a =0.5, so the equation is 2x/(a -x) =29.496.

So,

2x =29.496*(a -x) →2x =29.496a -29.496x.

Bring like terms together:

2x +29.496x =29.496a →31.496x=29.496*0.5 →31.496x=14.748 →x=14.748/31.496 ≈0.468.

Same result. So perhaps the options have a typo, or I'm miscalculating.

Wait, maybe the problem is part (b), but I'm confusing the parts. Let me check part (b).

Part (b) is: I2 formed when H2=0.5 moles and HI=1.5 moles.

So, initial moles: H2=0.5, HI=1.5, and I2=0 (since it's being formed? Or maybe I2 is the product, so initial I2 is 0.)

Wait, perhaps the initial I2 is 0, and H2=0.5, HI=1.5. But that doesn't make sense because the reaction is H2 + I2 → 2HI. So if HI is 1.5, then perhaps some I2 is present.

Wait, perhaps the initial conditions for part (b) are H2=0.5, HI=1.5, and I2=0. Then the reaction would proceed to form more HI, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the initial I2 is some amount, but the problem states that I2 is formed, so maybe the initial I2 is 0, and the reaction is proceeding from H2 and I2 to form HI.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify.

For part (b), the question is: calculate the moles of I2 formed when H2=0.5 moles and HI=1.5 moles. So, perhaps the initial moles are H2=0.5, HI=1.5, and I2=0, and the reaction will proceed to form more I2. But that doesn't make sense because the reaction as written is H2 + I2 → 2HI. So, if HI is present, perhaps it's a reverse reaction, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that part (b) starts with H2=0.5 and HI=1.5, and some I2 is formed. So, I'll set up the ICE table for part (b).

Reaction: H2 + I2 ⇌ 2HI.

Given that H2=0.5 moles and HI=1.5 moles, and I2 is formed. So, initial I2 would be 0, but perhaps some I2 is formed as the system moves to equilibrium.

Wait, but if HI is 1.5 moles, that implies that some I2 has already reacted. Alternatively, perhaps the initial state is H2=0.5, HI=1.5, and I2=0, and the reaction will proceed to form I2, meaning the reverse reaction.

Wait, that doesn't seem right because Kp is 870, which is large, so the forward reaction is favored. So, perhaps part (b) is a different scenario, but I'm getting stuck.

Wait, perhaps I should focus back on part (a) since the options don't match my calculation. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in part (a) and the correct option is B, which has HI=0.936, I2=0.010. But according to my calculation, I2 should be 0.032, which is not in the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the Kp expression.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the reaction is written as 2HI ⇌ H2 + I2, which would change the K expression. Let me check.

If the reaction is written as 2HI ⇌ H2 + I2, then Kp would be 1/870. But the problem states the reaction as H2 + I2 ⇌ 2HI with Kp=870, so the initial setup was correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that in part (a), the initial moles of HI are zero, and the reaction proceeds forward, so the setup is correct, but perhaps the answer is option B, assuming that I made a miscalculation in x.

Wait, let me recheck the Kp calculation.

4x²/(0.5-x)^2 = 870.

Let me compute 4x² =870*(0.5 -x)^2.

Expanding (0.5 -x)^2: 0.25 -x +x².

So,

4x²=870*(0.25 -x +x²)

4x² = 870*0.25 -870x +870x²

4x²=217.5 -870x +870x²

Bring all terms to left:

4x² -217.5 +870x -870x²=0

(4x² -870x²) +870x -217.5=0 →-866x² +870x -217.5=0.

Multiply both sides by -1:

866x² -870x +217.5=0.

Now, solve using quadratic formula:

x = [870 ± sqrt(870^2 -4*866*217.5)]/(2*866).

Compute discriminant:

870^2 =756,900.

4*866*217.5 =4*866=3464; 3464*217.5= let's compute:

3464 * 200=692,800; 3464*17.5= approx 3464*17=58, 3464*0.5=1732 → 58,  so 3464*17.5=60, 3464*17= 58, 888 → wait, perhaps better to compute 3464 * 217.5:

Wait, 3464 *217.5 = 3464*(200 +17.5) = 3464*200 +3464*17.5.

3464*200=692,800.

3464*17.5: 3464*10=34,640; 3464*7.5=25,980 → total=34,640+25,980=60,620.

So, 692,800 +60,620=753,420.

So, 4*866*217.5=753,420.

Discriminant=756,900 -753,420=3,480.

So sqrt(3,480)= approx 59.

So,

x= [870 ±59]/(2*866) → [870 ±59]/1732.

So two possible solutions:

x=(870+59)/1732=929/1732≈0.5364 → but this would make (0.5 -x)= negative, which isn't possible, so discard.

x=(870-59)/1732=811/1732≈0.468.

So x≈0.468, same as before.

So, the calculation is correct, but the options don't have this. Therefore, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, perhaps in part (a), the initial moles are H2=0.5, I2=0.5, and HI=0, but the total pressure is such that the partial pressures are in terms of mole fractions.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses Kp as Kc, but that would be incorrect because Kp and Kc are different.

Wait, another approach: Let me assume that the reaction is in a container of volume V, and the total moles at equilibrium are (0.5 -x) + (0.5 -x) +2x= 1 - 2x +2x=1 mole.

Wait, no. 0.5 -x (H2) + 0.5 -x (I2) +2x (HI) = (0.5+0.5) + ( -x -x +2x )=1 +0=1 mole.

So total moles at equilibrium are 1 mole.

If the volume is V and temperature T, then the total pressure is (n_total)RT/V = (1) RT/V.

The partial pressures would be:

P_H2 = (0.5 -x) RT/V,

P_I2 = (0.5 -x) RT/V,

P_HI = (2x) RT/V.

So Kp = ( (2x RT/V)^2 ) / [ (0.5 -x)^2 (RT/V)^2 ) ] = (4x²)/(0.5 -x)^2 =870.

Which is the same equation as before. So no change.

So I think my calculation is correct, but the options don't match. Therefore, perhaps I should look for the closest option, which is option B: 0.936 HI and 0.010 I2. But according to my calculation, I2 is 0.032, which isn't an option. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in part (a), and the correct option is B for part (a), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps part (a) is asking for the moles of HI, and the I2 is 0.032, but since none of the options match, perhaps the correct choice isn't listed, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I should proceed to part (b) to see if it aligns better with the options.

Part (b): I2 formed when H2=0.5 moles and HI=1.5 moles.

So, initial moles: H2=0.5, HI=1.5, I2=0.

Wait, but the reaction is H2 + I2 ⇌ 2HI, so if HI is 1.5, that suggests that some reaction has already occurred. Alternatively, perhaps the initial state is H2=0.5, I2= y, and HI=1.5. But the problem states that I2 is formed when H2=0.5 and HI=1.5. So perhaps the initial I2 is 0, and the reaction proceeds forward, but that would require H2 and I2 to react to form HI, which is already present. This is confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial moles are H2=0.5, HI=1.5, and I2=0, and the reaction will proceed to form more I2, which would require the reverse reaction to occur. But with Kp=870, the forward reaction is favored, so the reverse would have a Kp of 1/870, which is small, so the reverse reaction would not proceed much. So perhaps very little I2 is formed.

Let me set up the ICE table for part (b):

Reaction: 2HI ⇌ H2 + I2 (reverse reaction)

Initial moles: HI=1.5, H2=0.5, I2=0.

Change: Let x be the moles of HI that decompose. So,

HI: 1.5 -2x,

H2:0.5 +x,

I2:0 +x.

At equilibrium:

[HI]=1.5 -2x,

[H2]=0.5 +x,

[I2]=x.

The Kp for the reverse reaction is 1/870 ≈0.001149.

The Kp expression for the reverse reaction is (P_H2 * P_I2) / (P_HI)^2 =1/870.

Expressing partial pressures in terms of moles and volume V:

P_H2 = (0.5 +x) RT/V,

P_I2 = x RT/V,

P_HI = (1.5 -2x) RT/V.

Substituting into Kp:

[ (0.5 +x) RT/V * x RT/V ] / [ (1.5 -2x) RT/V )^2 ] =1/870.

Simplify:

[ (0.5 +x) x (RT/V)^2 ] / [ (1.5 -2x)^2 (RT/V)^2 ) ] = ( (0.5 +x) x ) / (1.5 -2x)^2 ) =1/870.

So,

( (0.5 +x) x ) / (1.5 -2x)^2 =1/870.

This is a quartic equation, which might be difficult to solve. Let me make an assumption that x is small, so 1.5 -2x ≈1.5, and 0.5 +x ≈0.5.

Then,

(0.5 *x ) / (1.5)^2 ≈x/(4.5) =1/870 → x≈4.5/870≈0.00517 moles.

So, x≈0.00517.

Thus, moles of I2 formed would be approximately 0.00517, and moles of HI would be 1.5 -2*(0.00517)=1.48966≈1.490.

But looking at the options, part (b) is about I2 formed. The options for part (b) would be in the same options as part (a), but the options provided are for both parts, so perhaps the correct option for part (b) is I: HI=0.468, I2=0.005.

Wait, no, part (b) is about I2 formed, so the moles of I2 would be x≈0.00517, which matches option I: I2=0.005.

But in the options, option I is: HI=0.468, I2=0.005. But in part (b), HI would be 1.5 -2x=1.5 -0.01034=1.48966, not 0.468.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me re-express:

In part (b), the initial moles are H2=0.5, HI=1.5, I2=0. We are to find the moles of I2 formed, which is x≈0.00517.

So, at equilibrium, HI=1.5-2x≈1.490, H2=0.5 +x≈0.505, I2=x≈0.005.

Looking at the options, option I is: HI=0.468, I2=0.005. But this would imply that HI decreased by 1.032 moles, which isn't the case here. So perhaps option I is for part (a), but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should consider both parts together. If part (a) gives HI=0.936, I2=0.032, but the closest option is B: HI=0.936, I2=0.010, and part (b) gives I2=0.005, which is option I: HI=0.468, I2=0.005. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should make a better approximation for part (b). Let me try to solve the equation more accurately.

We have:

( (0.5 +x) x ) / (1.5 -2x)^2 =1/870.

Let me denote this as:

(0.5x +x²) / ( (1.5 -2x)^2 ) =1/870.

Cross-multiplied:

870(0.5x +x²) = (1.5 -2x)^2.

Expand RHS:

(1.5)^2 -2*1.5*2x + (2x)^2 =2.25 -6x +4x².

So,

870*(0.5x +x²) =2.25 -6x +4x².

Compute LHS:

870*0.5x=435x,

870*x²=870x².

So,

435x +870x² =2.25 -6x +4x².

Bring all terms to left:

435x +870x² -2.25 +6x -4x²=0 → (870x² -4x²) + (435x +6x) -2.25=0 →866x² +441x -2.25=0.

Now, solve 866x² +441x -2.25=0.

Using quadratic formula:

x=[-441 ±sqrt(441^2 +4*866*2.25)]/(2*866).

Compute discriminant:

441^2=194,481.

4*866*2.25=4*866=3464; 3464*2.25=7,800.

So discriminant=194,481 +7,800=202,281.

sqrt(202,281)= approx 449.75.

So,

x=[-441 ±449.75]/(2*866).

We take the positive root:

x=( -441 +449.75 )/(1732) →8.75/1732≈0.00505.

So, x≈0.00505 moles.

Thus, I2 formed is approximately 0.00505, which aligns with option I: I2=0.005.

But looking back, option I is for HI=0.468 and I2=0.005, which doesn't match part (b) because in part (b), HI is around 1.49, not 0.468.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused between the two parts. Let me recap.

After solving part (a), I found that HI=0.936, I2=0.032. But the options don't have this, so perhaps the correct option for part (a) is not listed, but in the options, the closest is option B: HI=0.936, I2=0.010.

For part (b), I found I2=0.005, which matches option I: I2=0.005, but in that option, HI is 0.468, which doesn't align with part (b)'s calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in part (b)'s setup. Let me think again.

In part (b), the problem states: "I2 formed when H2=0.5 moles and HI=1.5 moles." So, perhaps the initial moles are H2=0.5, HI=1.5, and I2=0, and the reaction is proceeding forward. But that doesn't make sense because if the reaction is forward, I2 would be consumed, not formed. So perhaps the reaction is going in reverse, which would form I2 and H2 from HI.

So, the reaction is 2HI ⇌ H2 + I2, with Kp=1/870.

The initial moles are HI=1.5, H2=0.5, I2=0.

Let me set up the ICE table:

Reaction: 2HI ⇌ H2 + I2.

Initial: [HI]=1.5, [H2]=0.5, [I2]=0.

Change: Let x be the moles of HI that decompose. So,

HI:1.5 -2x,

H2:0.5 +x,

I2:0 +x.

At equilibrium, these are the moles.

The Kp expression is (P_H2 * P_I2) / (P_HI)^2 =1/870.

Expressing partial pressures as (moles/V) RT,

P_H2 = (0.5 +x) RT/V,

P_I2 =x RT/V,

P_HI = (1.5 -2x) RT/V.

Substituting into Kp:

[ (0.5 +x) RT/V * x RT/V ] / [ (1.5 -2x) RT/V )^2 ] =1/870.

Simplifying,

( (0.5 +x) x (RT/V)^2 ) / ( (1.5 -2x)^2 (RT/V)^2 ) ) =1/870 → ( (0.5 +x)x ) / (1.5 -2x)^2 )=1/870.

Which is the same equation as before, leading to x≈0.00505.

So, I2 formed is 0.00505, which is approximately 0.005 moles.

Looking at the options, option I is HI=0.468, I2=0.005. But in this case, HI is 1.5 -2x=1.5 -0.0101≈1.4899, not 0.468. So perhaps option I is not for part (b).

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the parts. Maybe the options are for each part separately, and for part (a), the correct option is B, and for part (b), the correct option is I.

But the problem asks to calculate for both (a) and (b), but the options are given as a list, so perhaps the correct answer is option B for part (a) and option I for part (b).

But looking back, the problem says "the number of moles of the following at equilibrium." It's a bit ambiguous, but perhaps the options are for each part, but the way it's written, each option includes both (a) and (b), which complicates things.

Alternatively, perhaps the options are for each part, but the way it's written, each option corresponds to a specific part. But the way the question is phrased, it's unclear.

In any case, based on my calculations:

For part (a), the moles are HI=0.936, I2=0.032, but the closest option is B: HI=0.936, I2=0.010.

For part (b), the moles are I2=0.005, HI=1.49, but the only option with I2=0.005 is option I: HI=0.468, I2=0.005, which doesn't align with part (b).

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in part (a) and the correct answer is option B for part (a). 

After considering all possibilities, I think the correct answer for part (a) is option B: 0.936 moles of HI and 0.010 moles of I2, even though my calculation suggests 0.032 for I2. Perhaps there's a rounding or miscalculation I'm missing.

The problem involves calculating the equilibrium moles for two scenarios of the reaction \( \text{H}_2(g) + \text{I}_2(g) \rightleftharpoons 2\text{HI}(g) \) with \( K_p = 870 \) at 25°C. 

### Part (a): HI formed when \( \text{H}_2 = 0.5 \) moles and \( \text{I}_2 = 0.5 \) moles
1. **Initial Setup**:  
   - Initial moles: \( [\text{H}_2] = 0.5 \), \( [\text{I}_2] = 0.5 \), \( [\text{HI}] = 0 \).  
   - Change: \( \text{H}_2 \) and \( \text{I}_2 \) decrease by \( x \), \( \text{HI} \) increases by \( 2x \).  

2. **Equilibrium Moles**:  
   - \( [\text{H}_2] = 0.5 - x \), \( [\text{I}_2] = 0.5 - x \), \( [\text{HI}] = 2x \).  

3. **Expression for \( K_p \)**:  
   \[
   K_p = \frac{(P_{\text{HI}})^2}{P_{\text{H}_2} \cdot P_{\text{I}_2}} = \frac{(2x)^2}{(0.5 - x)^2} = 870
   \]
   Simplifying:
   \[
   \frac{4x^2}{(0.5 - x)^2} = 870 \implies \frac{2x}{0.5 - x} = \sqrt{870} \approx 29.496
   \]
   Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   2x = 29.496(0.5 - x) \implies 2x = 14.748 - 29.496x \implies 31.496x = 14.748 \implies x \approx 0.468
   \]

4. **Equilibrium Moles**:  
   - \( [\text{HI}] = 2x = 0.936 \), \( [\text{I}_2] = 0.5 - x = 0.032 \).  

5. **Closest Option**:  
   The calculated \( [\text{I}_2] = 0.032 \) does not match any option. However, the closest match is **Option B**: \( [\text{HI}] = 0.936 \), \( [\text{I}_2] = 0.010 \).

---

### Part (b): \( \text{I}_2 \) formed when \( \text{H}_2 = 0.5 \) moles and \( \text{HI} = 1.5 \) moles
1. **Initial Setup**:  
   - Initial moles: \( [\text{H}_2] = 0.5 \), \( [\text{HI}] = 1.5 \), \( [\text{I}_2] = 0 \).  

2. **Reverse Reaction**:  
   Since \( K_p = 870 \) is large, the forward reaction is favored. However, the problem involves forming \( \text{I}_2 \), implying the reverse reaction:  
   \[
   2\text{HI} \rightleftharpoons \text{H}_2 + \text{I}_2
   \]
   - Let \( x \) be the moles of \( \text{HI} \) that decompose.  
   - Change: \( [\text{HI}] = 1.5 - 2x \), \( [\text{H}_2] = 0.5 + x \), \( [\text{I}_2] = x \).  

3. **Expression for \( K_p \) (reverse reaction)**:  
   \[
   K_p = \frac{1}{870} = \frac{(P_{\text{H}_2} \cdot P_{\text{I}_2})}{(P_{\text{HI}})^2}
   \]
   Substituting partial pressures:
   \[
   \frac{(0.5 + x) \cdot x}{(1.5 - 2x)^2} = \frac{1}{870}
   \]
   Simplifying and solving for \( x \) yields \( x \approx 0.005 \).

4. **Equilibrium Moles**:  
   - \( [\text{I}_2] = x = 0.005 \), \( [\text{HI}] = 1.5 - 2x \approx 1.49 \).

5. **Closest Option**:  
   The calculated \( [\text{I}_2] = 0.005 \) matches **Option I**: \( [\text{HI}] = 0.468 \), \( [\text{I}_2] = 0.005 \). However, the \( [\text{HI}] \) value does not align with the calculation, suggesting a possible mismatch in the options.

---

### Final Answer:
For part (a), the closest match is **Option B**: \( [\text{HI}] = 0.936 \), \( [\text{I}_2] = 0.010 \).  
For part (b), the closest match is **Option I**: \( [\text{HI}] = 0.468 \), \( [\text{I}_2] = 0.005 \).  

**Answer:** B
