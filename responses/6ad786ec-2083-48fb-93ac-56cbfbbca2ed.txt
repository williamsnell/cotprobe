Question:

A teenager shot and killed a man she said tried to attack her as she was walking home from an all night market. The teenager, 18 years old and 6 feet 3 inches tall, said a very short man placed a knife against her throat and unzipped her dress as she was walking down the street. She pulled a gun from her purse and shot him. The man died of a chest wound. Police said the man, who was 5 feet 5 inches tall and weighed 130 pounds, was an ex-felon, twice convicted of attempted rape. The teenager is charged with the murder of the man, as a result of the above described incident. At trial, the teenager wishes to offer evidence of the fact that the man was previously convicted of attempted rape. The evidence would be

Options:

A: inadmissible, because it could bias the jury against the victim.
B: inadmissible, because the evidence is being used to prove propensity.
C: admissible, as it could be used to establish the teenager's fear of the man.
D: inadmissible, because it violates the Dead Man's Statute.
E: admissible, because it proves the man's disposition to commit rape.
F: admissible, because it supports the teenager's claim of self-defense.
G: admissible, because the victim's prior convictions would be relevant on the issue of the defendant's self-defense.
H: inadmissible, as it breaches the victim's right to a fair trial.
I: inadmissible, as it is irrelevant to the current case.
J: admissible, because it provides a motive for the teenager's actions.

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about evidence admissibility in a criminal trial. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The scenario is that an 18-year-old teenager shot and killed a man she claimed tried to attack her. She's being charged with murder, and at trial, she wants to introduce evidence that the man was previously convicted of attempted rape twice. The question is about whether this evidence is admissible.

First, I need to recall the rules of evidence, specifically about character evidence and its use in criminal trials. I remember that in criminal cases, the prosecution can introduce evidence about the defendant's bad character to show they have a criminal propensity, but the defense usually cannot use the defendant's good character to show they're not guilty. Wait, no, actually, the defense can bring up the defendant's good character for the specific trait relevant to the charge. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, in self-defense cases, the defendant's reasonable belief in imminent danger is crucial. So, if the victim had a history of violent crimes, especially against women, that could support the defendant's belief that the victim was about to attack them. I think the idea is that past behavior can indicate future actions, so if the victim had a history of attempted rape, it might make the defendant's fear more reasonable.

But I also remember something about the "character evidence rule." Under the Federal Rules of Evidence, a person's character trait can be admissible if it's relevant to prove conduct on a particular occasion. For example, if the defendant's fear was reasonable based on the victim's past behavior, then the victim's past crimes could be relevant.

Wait, but there's also the issue of whether this evidence is being used to show propensity. The prosecution can't use the defendant's past crimes to show they have a propensity to commit the crime they're charged with, unless it's for a specific purpose like showing a modus operandi. But for the defense, if they're introducing the victim's past crimes to show why the defendant was afraid, that might be allowed under FRE 405(a), which allows specific instances of conduct to prove a character trait.

In this case, the teenager wants to show that the man had a history of attempted rape, which could make her fear of being attacked more reasonable. So, his prior convictions would be used to show his character for violence, which is relevant to her belief in self-defense.

But wait, another thought: the Dead Man's Statute. I think that's a rule that prevents parties from introducing evidence about a deceased person's character unless the other side has already opened the door. But I'm not sure if that applies here because the defense is introducing the evidence, not the prosecution. So maybe the Dead Man's Statute isn't the issue here.

Looking at the options:

A: Inadmissible because it could bias the jury against the victim. While it might bias, bias isn't the main issue here; relevance is. So probably not the right reason.

B: Inadmissible because it's used to prove propensity. Wait, the defense is using it to show the victim's character, not the defendant's. So maybe this isn't the right reason either, because the prosecution can't use it for propensity, but the defense can use it for a legitimate purpose like self-defense.

C: Admissible to establish the teenager's fear. That sounds plausible because her fear would be reasonable if the victim had a history of violent crimes.

D: Inadmissible under Dead Man's Statute. Maybe, but I'm not sure if that applies when the defense is introducing the evidence.

E: Admissible because it shows his disposition to commit rape. That's similar to C but more about disposition. But I think the main point is the relevance to the defendant's fear, not his disposition.

F: Admissible because it supports the teenager's claim of self-defense. Yes, that's exactly what it's for. The prior convictions would support her belief that he was about to attack her.

G: Admissible because the victim's prior convictions are relevant to the defendant's self-defense. This seems correct too, as his past behavior could show a pattern that justifies her fear.

H: Inadmissible because it breaches the victim's right to a fair trial. I don't think that's the case; the victim's rights aren't violated when his past crimes are admitted in defense.

I: Inadmissible as irrelevant. No, because it's relevant to her state of mind.

J: Admissible because it provides a motive for the teenager's actions. Motive is different; her actions were in self-defense, not because of a motive. So J might not fit.

So, the options C, F, G seem relevant. Now, which is the best answer.

Option C says it's admissible to establish her fear. Option F says it supports her self-defense claim. Option G says it's relevant to self-defense.

Wait, under FRE 404(a)(2), a defendant can offer evidence of the victim's character to show that the defendant's fear was reasonable. So in this case, the teenager's fear is central to her self-defense claim. The victim's prior convictions would be admissible to show his character, which in turn supports her belief in imminent danger.

So looking at the options, F says it supports her claim, which is correct. G says it's relevant on the issue of self-defense, which is also correct.

Wait, but the options are about whether the evidence is admissible. So the correct reason would be that it's admissible because it supports her claim of self-defense, which relates to the reasonableness of her belief.

Alternatively, G says it's relevant on the issue of self-defense. Both F and G seem correct, but let me check the options again.

Looking back, the question is: "The teenager is charged with the murder of the man, as a result of the above described incident. At trial, the teenager wishes to offer evidence of the fact that the man was previously convicted of attempted rape. The evidence would be..."

So the issue is whether this evidence is admissible. The options are:

F: admissible, because it supports the teenager's claim of self-defense.

G: admissible, because the victim's prior convictions would be relevant on the issue of the defendant's self-defense.

Hmm. Both F and G seem to align. However, F is more about supporting the claim, while G is about relevance to the self-defense issue.

Wait, the evidence is being offered to show that the victim's prior convictions are relevant to whether the defendant's fear was reasonable. So under FRE 404(a)(2), the defendant can introduce specific instances of the victim's conduct to show his character trait of violence, which in turn supports the defendant's reasonable belief in self-defense.

So the correct reasoning is that the evidence is admissible because it supports the teenager's claim of self-defense by showing the victim's character, which makes her fear reasonable.

Therefore, the correct answer is F or G. Let me see the options again.

Option F: Admissible, because it supports the teenager's claim of self-defense.

Option G: Admissible, because the victim's prior convictions would be relevant on the issue of the defendant's self-defense.

I think both F and G are correct, but perhaps the better choice is F, as it directly states that it supports her claim, which is the purpose.

Alternatively, G is more about the relevance, which is also correct. I'm a bit confused, but I think the best answer is F because it directly ties to the purpose of supporting the self-defense claim.
</think>

The evidence of the man's prior convictions for attempted rape is admissible because it supports the teenager's claim of self-defense by showing her reasonable belief in imminent danger. This aligns with the Federal Rules of Evidence, which allow the use of specific instances of a victim's conduct to establish a character trait relevant to the defendant's fear. 

Answer: F
