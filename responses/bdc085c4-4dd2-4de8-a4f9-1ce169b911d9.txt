Question:

Margaret Mead suggested that:

Options:

A: cultural norms have no influence on adolescence and gender roles

E: gender roles are universally identical and biologically determined
F: every society has the same adolescence experience
G: adolescence and gender roles varied between societies and so were culturally determined
H: there are no variations in gender roles and adolescence across different cultures
I: adolescence in the USA is a time of relative calm compared to the experience in Japan and Europe
J: adolescence is universally a time of turmoil and confusion

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about Margaret Mead's views on culture and gender roles. The question is asking what Mead suggested, and I need to pick the correct option from A to J. I'm a bit rusty on my anthropology, but I remember Mead did some significant work on gender roles in different societies. Let me think through each option.

Option A says cultural norms have no influence on adolescence and gender roles. That seems off because Mead is known for her work on how culture shapes behavior, including gender roles. So A is probably wrong.

Option B claims that gender roles in three New Guinea societies were identical, thus biologically determined. Wait, I think Mead actually found that gender roles varied a lot across these societies. She wrote about how different groups had different behaviors, which contradicts B. So B is incorrect.

Option C suggests anthropological fieldwork is completely objective. I recall that Mead, along with others like Franz Boas, was critical of the idea that fieldwork could be completely unbiased. They emphasized the subjective nature of research. So C is likely wrong.

Option D states that fieldwork can be problematic because the researcher's values affect interpretations. That sounds familiar. Mead was aware of the researcher's bias and how it can influence findings. So D might be correct.

Option E says gender roles are universally identical and biologically determined. No, Mead's work showed that gender roles are culturally constructed, not universal or biologically fixed. So E is wrong.

Option F claims every society has the same adolescence experience. That doesn't make sense because Mead's research highlighted cultural variations, so F is incorrect.

Option G suggests that adolescence and gender roles vary between societies and are culturally determined. Yes, this aligns with Mead's findings. She studied different societies and found that behaviors and roles are shaped by culture, so G seems right.

Option H says there are no variations in gender roles and adolescence across cultures. That's the opposite of what Mead found, so H is wrong.

Option I talks about adolescence in the USA being calm compared to Japan and Europe. I don't remember Mead making specific comparisons like this; her focus was more on the variability across different societies, not just between specific countries. So I is probably not correct.

Option J states that adolescence is universally a time of turmoil. Again, Mead's work suggests that experiences vary, so J is incorrect.

So, looking back, the correct answer is likely either D or G. I know Mead emphasized cultural influence on gender roles (so G is right), and she also discussed the researcher's bias (so D is also correct). Wait, but the question is asking what Mead suggested. She did talk about both the cultural determination of roles and the subjectivity in fieldwork. However, the options are separate. Let me think about which one is more directly her main point.

Mead's famous work, "Coming of Age in Samoa," focused on how adolescence and gender roles are culturally constructed. She showed that what is considered appropriate behavior for boys and girls varies widely, supporting option G. She also criticized the notion that biology determines gender roles, which further points to G.

On the other hand, option D is more about the methodology of fieldwork, which is true, but the question is about what Mead suggested regarding culture and gender. So the main point is G.

The correct answer is G: adolescence and gender roles varied between societies and so were culturally determined.

Answer: G
