Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about when Aborigines occupied the harsh interior of Australia. The options are from A to J, each giving a different time range. I need to figure out the correct answer.

First, I remember that the Aborigines are the original inhabitants of Australia, and their history goes back a long time. I think their arrival in Australia is linked to the land being connected to other areas due to lower sea levels during the ice ages. But I'm not exactly sure about the exact dates.

I recall that the consensus among many experts is that humans arrived in Australia somewhere around 50,000 to 60,000 years ago. But wait, the question is specifically about when they occupied the harsh interior. I think that the initial settlements might have been along the coasts, which were more accessible and had more resources. Moving into the harsh interior probably happened later as they adapted and found ways to survive in those environments.

So, if the initial arrival was around 50,000-60,000 years ago, moving into the interior might have happened a bit after that. Let me look at the options again. 

Option A is 40,000–45,000 years ago. That seems a bit recent. Option B is 60,000–65,000, which is earlier than the initial arrival I thought. Option C is even earlier, 70,000–75,000, which I don't think is right because that's before humans are believed to have left Africa. Option D is 15,000–20,000, which is much later, maybe during the last ice age? Option E is 10,000–12,000, which is after the ice age, when Australia was less harsh perhaps.

Option F is 30,000–35,000, which is within the initial arrival period. Option G is 50,000–55,000, which aligns with the initial arrival. So maybe the occupation of the interior happened around when they first arrived, or a bit after. 

Wait, I think that the harsh interior might have been colonized after the initial coastal settlements. So perhaps around the time when they had been there for a few thousand years, adapting and moving inland. If they arrived around 50k years ago, maybe the interior was occupied a few thousand years later, say around 40k-45k years ago. That would make Option A the correct answer.

Alternatively, maybe the interior was occupied earlier. I'm a bit confused. Another angle: the date of the first evidence of humans in the interior. I think there's evidence like tools or art that suggests they were there around 40k years ago. So maybe Option A is correct.

The Aborigines are believed to have arrived in Australia around 50,000–60,000 years ago, primarily settling along the coasts. The harsh interior was likely colonized later as they adapted and developed strategies to survive in those environments. Evidence suggests they inhabited the interior around 40,000–45,000 years ago, making Option A the correct answer.

Answer: A
