Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the length of the curve given by the parametric equations x = cos t and y = sin t, where t goes from 0 to π. Hmm, I remember that to find the length of a parametric curve, there's a formula involving integrating the square root of the derivatives of x and y with respect to t, all squared and added together, right?

Let me write that down. The formula is:

L = ∫√[(dx/dt)² + (dy/dt)²] dt, integrated from t = a to t = b.

In this case, a is 0 and b is π. So first, I need to find dx/dt and dy/dt.

Given x = cos t, so dx/dt is the derivative of cos t with respect to t, which is -sin t. Similarly, y = sin t, so dy/dt is the derivative of sin t, which is cos t.

Now, I'll square both derivatives:

(dx/dt)² = (-sin t)² = sin² t.

(dy/dt)² = (cos t)² = cos² t.

Adding them together: sin² t + cos² t. Wait, that's one of those Pythagorean identities! So sin² t + cos² t = 1.

So the integrand simplifies to √1, which is just 1. That makes things a lot easier.

So the integral becomes L = ∫1 dt from t = 0 to t = π. Integrating 1 with respect to t is just t, so evaluating from 0 to π gives π - 0 = π.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me think again. The parametric equations x = cos t, y = sin t, that's the unit circle, right? But when t goes from 0 to π, it's only half the circle, from (1,0) up to (-1,0), moving counterclockwise through (0,1) at t = π/2. So the length of half the unit circle. The full circumference is 2π, so half of that should be π, which matches what I just got.

Looking back at the options, J is pi. So the answer must be J.

The curve is the unit circle's upper half, so its length is π.

Answer: J
