Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question here, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me read it again carefully. The question is about a task performed by group members where they select a solution offered by one of the group members as the group’s solution. I need to choose the right term from the options given.

First, I should understand what the question is asking. It seems to be describing a situation where the group isn't coming up with a completely new solution on their own but instead choosing one proposed by a member. So, maybe it's a type of decision-making process in groups.

Looking at the options, I remember that there are different types of decision-making strategies in groups. Let me think about each option:

A: associative - I'm not too sure about this one. It might relate to how ideas are connected, but not sure if it's about decision-making.

B: distributive - This usually refers to how resources are distributed, maybe in negotiations, but not directly about selecting a solution.

C: additive - This sounds like adding things up, maybe in problem-solving with numbers, but not related to group decision-making.

D: disjunctive - Hmm, disjunctive tasks. Wait, I think disjunctive tasks are ones where the group's performance depends on the individual with the most accurate information. So, in such tasks, the group solution is the one proposed by the individual who knows the most. That seems to fit the question because the group selects a solution offered by one member.

E: divisive - This might imply conflict or splitting, so probably not the right term here.

F: integrative - Integrative solutions are those where the group combines different ideas to create a better solution. So the group isn't just picking one person's idea but combining them. That doesn't fit the question.

G: collective - Collective tasks involve the group working together, but the question is more specific about selecting a single solution from a member.

H: compensatory - This is about how group members compensate for each other's weaknesses, but again, not directly about selecting a solution.

I: conjunctive - Conjunctive tasks require all members to agree on a solution. If one person doesn't agree, the task isn't completed. That's more about consensus rather than selecting one person's idea.

J: cooperative - Cooperative implies working together, but it's a general term and doesn't specify the decision-making process.

So, putting it together, the term that fits is disjunctive. Disjunctive tasks involve the group relying on one member's expertise, so they select that solution.

The correct answer is **D: disjunctive** because in disjunctive tasks, the group's solution is typically the one proposed by a single member, often the one with the most relevant expertise or information.

Answer: D
