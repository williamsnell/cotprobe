Answer:
    
<think>
Okay, so I've got this induction motor problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

Part (i) has three parts: (a) breakdown slip, (b) locked-rotor reactance, and (c) rotor frequency at maximum torque. Part (ii) has another three parts related to the rotor's induced voltage and some other parameters.

Starting with part (i)(a): Breakdown slip, s_b. I remember that in induction motors, the breakdown slip occurs when the motor is loaded beyond its maximum torque point, leading to a drop in speed. The formula for breakdown slip is s_b = (s_1 * (R2^2)) / (X2^2 + R2^2), where s_1 is the slip at maximum torque. Alternatively, another formula I think is s_b = R2²/(X2² + R2²), but I'm a bit confused about whether s_1 is involved here.

Wait, no, more accurately, the slip at breakdown (s_b) is given by s_b = (R2^2) / (X2^2 + R2^2). But I also recall that the slip at maximum torque (s_1) is given by s_1 = R2/(X2 + R2), but I might be mixing up the formulas here.

Wait, perhaps I should think differently. The motor is an 8-pole, 60 Hz SCIM. So the synchronous speed is calculated as (120 * f) / p, where f is the supply frequency and p is the number of poles. So that's (120 * 60) / 8 = 900 rpm. The motor is stalling at 650 rpm, so the slip is s = (synchronous speed - actual speed)/synchronous speed. So s = (900 - 650)/900 = 250/900 ≈ 0.2778. So that's approximately 0.278. Wait, but this is the slip at stall, not the breakdown slip. Hmm.

Wait, but when the motor stalls, it's at maximum torque, which occurs at a certain slip s_1. The breakdown slip is a different point, higher than s_1, where the torque starts to drop. So I need to find s_b, which is the slip at breakdown.

I think the formula for breakdown slip is s_b = R2²/(X2² + R2²), where R2 is the rotor resistance per phase, and X2 is the rotor reactance per phase. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, another formula I've heard is s_b = (R2²) / (X2² + R2²). But I'm not sure if that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should find the slip at maximum torque first. The slip at maximum torque is given by s_1 = R2 / (X2 + R2). But wait, I don't have X2 yet. Oh, wait, perhaps X2 is the rotor reactance, which is generally X2 = X_lr = locked-rotor reactance. Wait, but that's part (b) of the problem, which I'm supposed to calculate. So maybe I can't use X2 yet. Hmm, maybe I need to find X_lr first.

Wait, part (i)(b) is asking for the locked-rotor reactance, X_lr. I think X_lr is also known as the standstill reactance. For an induction motor, the locked-rotor reactance can be calculated using X_lr = (4 * π * f * M * L)^(1/2), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, it's often given as X_lr = (4π²f²M L)^(1/2), where M is the mutual inductance and L is the self-inductance. But without specific values for mutual inductance or inductance, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, another approach: The locked-rotor reactance (X_lr) is the same as the rotor reactance when the rotor is at standstill, so X2 = X_lr. But I think X_lr can also be expressed in terms of the machine's parameters, like the number of poles, frequency, etc. Alternatively, perhaps I can find it using the breakdown slip formula once I have s_b.

Wait, but I don't have s_b yet. Maybe I should first find s_1, the slip at maximum torque, using the stalling speed. Oh, wait, the motor is stalling at 650 rpm, which is the speed at maximum torque. So s_1 = (synchronous speed - speed at max torque) / synchronous speed. So s_1 = (900 - 650)/900 ≈ 250/900 ≈ 0.2778.

But I thought s_1 = R2/(X2 + R2). So substituting s_1 = 0.2778, and R2 = 0.3 ohms, we can solve for X2. Let me write that out:

s_1 = R2 / (X2 + R2)
0.2778 ≈ 0.3 / (X2 + 0.3)
Multiply both sides by (X2 + 0.3):
0.2778*(X2 + 0.3) = 0.3
0.2778 X2 + 0.08334 = 0.3
0.2778 X2 = 0.3 - 0.08334 = 0.21666
X2 = 0.21666 / 0.2778 ≈ 0.777 ohms.

Wait, but I'm not sure if this is correct because I might have mixed up the formula. Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is s_1 = R2/(X2 + R2). So with R2 = 0.3, and s_1 ≈ 0.2778, solving for X2:

0.2778 = 0.3 / (X2 + 0.3)
X2 + 0.3 = 0.3 / 0.2778 ≈ 1.08
So X2 ≈ 1.08 - 0.3 = 0.78 ohms.

Hmm, but then the breakdown slip s_b is given by s_b = R2²/(X2² + R2²).

Plugging in R2=0.3 and X2≈0.78:

s_b = (0.3)^2 / (0.78^2 + 0.3^2) = 0.09 / (0.6084 + 0.09) = 0.09 / 0.6984 ≈ 0.1289. That seems quite low, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I'm using the wrong formula.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing s_1 and s_b. Another approach: At maximum torque, the torque is proportional to (s * (R2 + s X2)^2) / (X2^2 + R2^2). Taking derivative with respect to s and setting to zero gives s_1 = R2/(X2 + R2), which is what I used earlier. So s_1 is indeed 0.2778. Then, breakdown slip s_b occurs when the torque starts to drop, and it's given by s_b = R2²/(X2² + R2²). With X2≈0.78, s_b = (0.3)^2/(0.78^2 + 0.3^2) ≈ 0.09/(0.6084 + 0.09) ≈ 0.09/0.6984 ≈ 0.1289. That's about 0.129, but looking at the options, none of them have s_b around 0.13. So maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate X2 differently. Maybe I should use the fact that X_lr is the same as X2 at standstill. Alternatively, perhaps X_lr is calculated based on the machine's parameters, like the number of poles and the supply frequency.

Wait, another formula for locked-rotor reactance is X_lr = (4π²f²M L)^(1/2), but without knowing M or L, I can't compute it numerically. Alternatively, perhaps X_lr can be calculated using the rotor's inductance, which is given by L2 = (μ₀ μ_r A² N²)/(l), but again, without specific values, it's hard to proceed.

Wait, perhaps I should look for another approach. The motor has 8 poles, so the synchronous speed is 900 rpm. The rotor is stalled at 650 rpm, so the slip is s = (900-650)/900 ≈ 0.2778. At this point, the motor is at maximum torque, so s_1 = 0.2778.

Then, using s_1 = R2/(X2 + R2), we can solve for X2.

So:

0.2778 = 0.3/(X2 + 0.3)
X2 + 0.3 = 0.3 / 0.2778 ≈ 1.08
X2 ≈ 1.08 - 0.3 = 0.78 ohms.

Then, s_b = R2²/(X2² + R2²) = (0.3)^2/(0.78^2 + 0.3^2) = 0.09/(0.6084 + 0.09) ≈ 0.09/0.6984 ≈ 0.1289. But looking at the options, none of the s_b values are around 0.1289. The options have s_b ranging from 0.22 to 0.5. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the formula for s_b is different. Another source says that the breakdown slip is s_b = (R2)^2/(X2)^2 + R2^2) = R2^2/(X2^2 + R2^2). So with X2 as 0.78, it's about 0.09/(0.6084 + 0.09) ≈ 0.129, which is as before. But none of the options match that.

Looking at the options, the closest s_b is in option G: 0.278, which is the slip at maximum torque, not breakdown. Hmm, perhaps I'm confusing s_1 and s_b.

Wait, perhaps the breakdown slip is when the torque starts to drop, which is higher than s_1. Wait, no, I think s_1 is the slip at maximum torque, and s_b is the slip at breakdown, which is higher than s_1. So maybe I need to recalculate.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula s_b = s_1 * (R2/(X2))². Wait, that might make sense. Let me try that.

So s_b = s_1 * (R2/X2)^2.

With s_1≈0.2778, R2=0.3, X2=0.78:

s_b = 0.2778 * (0.3/0.78)^2 ≈ 0.2778 * (0.3846)^2 ≈ 0.2778 * 0.1479 ≈ 0.0413. That's even lower, which doesn't make sense because breakdown slip should be higher than s_1.

Wait, perhaps I've got the formula wrong. Another approach: The torque is given by T = (3/2) * (s/(1 + s)) * (V^2 R2)/(X2^2 + (R2 + s X2)^2). At maximum torque, the derivative with respect to s is zero, leading to s_1 = R2/(X2 + R2), which is what I used earlier. For breakdown slip, perhaps it's when the denominator becomes such that the torque starts to decrease, which is when s increases beyond s_1. But I'm not sure about the exact formula.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the breakdown slip occurs when the rotor resistance is such that the power factor is 1, but that might be another concept.

Wait, maybe I should think about the options given. For part (i)(a), the breakdown slip options are:

A: 0.35
B: 0.31
C: 0.25
D: 0.22
E: 0.33
F: 0.5
G: 0.278
H: 0.4
I: 0.3
J: 0.45

I calculated s_1 as about 0.278, which is option G's s_b. But I thought s_b should be higher than s_1. So maybe G isn't correct. Alternatively, perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, perhaps I should think differently. The formula for s_b is s_b = (R2^2)/(X2^2 + R2^2). Let's see what X2 would be if s_b is one of the options. For example, option G's s_b is 0.278. Let's plug that into the formula:

0.278 = R2^2 / (X2^2 + R2^2)
0.278 (X2^2 + 0.09) = 0.09
0.278 X2^2 + 0.02502 = 0.09
0.278 X2^2 = 0.06498
X2^2 = 0.06498 / 0.278 ≈ 0.234
X2 ≈ sqrt(0.234) ≈ 0.484 ohms.

But earlier, using s_1 = 0.2778, I found X2≈0.78 ohms, which doesn't match this. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the fact that X2 is the same as X_lr, the locked-rotor reactance. So part (i)(b) is X_lr, which is X2. So if I can find X_lr, I can find s_b.

Wait, perhaps I can find X_lr using the locked-rotor impedance. The locked-rotor impedance Z_lr is given by Z_lr = R2 + j X_lr. But without knowing the rotor current or voltage, it's hard to find Z_lr directly.

Wait, another approach: The locked-rotor current is I2 = V2 / Z_lr, where V2 is the rotor voltage. But V2 is not given. Alternatively, perhaps I can find X_lr using the formula X_lr = (4π²f²L2), where L2 is the rotor inductance. But without L2, I can't compute it.

Hmm, this is getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should look for another way. Let's think about the rotor frequency at maximum torque. Part (i)(c) asks for the rotor frequency at maximum torque. The rotor frequency f_r is given by f_r = s * f_s, where f_s is the supply frequency. So f_r = s * 60 Hz.

At maximum torque, s = s_1 ≈ 0.2778, so f_r ≈ 0.2778 * 60 ≈ 16.668 Hz, which is approximately 16.7 Hz. Looking at the options, option G's f_r is 16.7 Hz, which matches this. So that's a good sign that option G is correct for part (i)(c).

Now, looking back at part (i)(b), locked-rotor reactance X_lr. If option G's X_lr is 1.08 Ω, then let's see if that makes sense. If X2 = X_lr = 1.08 Ω, then using s_1 = R2/(X2 + R2) = 0.3/(1.08 + 0.3) = 0.3/1.38 ≈ 0.2178. But earlier, we calculated s_1 as 0.2778 based on the stalling speed. So there's a discrepancy here.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating s_1. The stalling speed is 650 rpm, which is the speed at maximum torque. So the slip s_1 is (900 - 650)/900 ≈ 0.2778. So s_1 = 0.2778.

If X_lr is 1.08 Ω, then s_1 = 0.3/(1.08 + 0.3) ≈ 0.2178, which doesn't match the 0.2778 we calculated. So that suggests that X_lr is not 1.08 Ω. Therefore, option G might not be correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate X_lr using the fact that s_1 = R2/(X2 + R2). So with s_1 = 0.2778 and R2=0.3, X2 = R2/(s_1) - R2 = 0.3/0.2778 - 0.3 ≈ 1.08 - 0.3 = 0.78 Ω. So X_lr would be 0.78 Ω, but none of the options have X_lr around 0.78.

Looking at the options, option G has X_lr = 1.08 Ω, which is higher than 0.78. So perhaps I'm making a mistake here.

Wait, another thought: The locked-rotor reactance X_lr is the same as the rotor reactance when the rotor is at standstill, so X2 = X_lr. So if I calculate X2 using s_1, it should equal X_lr. But according to our earlier calculation, X2 = 0.78 Ω, but option G's X_lr is 1.08 Ω. So perhaps my approach is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for s_b is different. Another formula I found online says that s_b = (R2^2)/(X2^2 + R2^2). So if I use X2 = X_lr, which is part (i)(b), then I can calculate s_b.

Wait, but without knowing X_lr, I can't compute s_b. So perhaps I should look for another approach. Maybe I can use the fact that the starting torque is related to the rotor resistance and reactance.

Wait, perhaps I should move on to part (ii) for a moment, as it might give me some clues. Part (ii) says the induced voltage per phase in the rotor is 112 V. Using the data from part (i), determine (a) added rotor resistance, (b) rotor power factor, and (c) starting current.

The induced voltage in the rotor is E2 = 112 V. The rotor's equivalent circuit has resistance R2 and reactance X2. At starting, the rotor is short-circuited, so the starting current is I_r = E2/(R2 + X2).

Wait, but in part (ii)(c), they're asking for the starting current when the rotor has added resistance. So perhaps in part (ii)(a), they're adding resistance to the rotor circuit to achieve the same starting torque as when it's short-circuited.

Wait, but the starting torque is proportional to (s * E2^2)/(R2 + j X2)^2. To have the same starting torque with added resistance, the new resistance R_x must be chosen such that the torque remains the same. But I'm not sure about the exact approach.

Alternatively, perhaps part (ii)(a) is asking for the added resistance R_x such that the rotor's resistance becomes R2 + R_x, and the starting torque is the same as when it's short-circuited.

Wait, the starting torque when short-circuited is proportional to (s * E2^2)/(R2^2 + X2^2). When adding resistance R_x, the new resistance is R2 + R_x, and the torque would be (s * E2^2)/( (R2 + R_x)^2 + X2^2 ). Setting this equal to the original torque:

(s * E2^2)/(R2^2 + X2^2) = (s * E2^2)/( (R2 + R_x)^2 + X2^2 )

Which implies that R2^2 + X2^2 = (R2 + R_x)^2 + X2^2. So R2^2 = (R2 + R_x)^2. Taking square roots, R2 = R2 + R_x, which implies R_x = 0. That can't be right. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the added resistance to produce the same starting torque as when the rotor is short-circuited. So, when the rotor is short-circuited, the resistance is R2, but when we add R_x, the effective resistance becomes R2 + R_x. The torque is proportional to (s * E2^2)/( (R2 + R_x)^2 + X2^2 ). To have the same torque as when it's short-circuited, we set:

(R2 + R_x)^2 + X2^2 = R2^2 + X2^2.

Which again implies R_x=0, which doesn't make sense. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the resistance to be added in series with the rotor to achieve the same starting torque as when it's short-circuited. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the starting torque is maximum when the rotor's resistance is such that the power factor is 1. Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of impedance matching.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the rotor current and then find R_x such that the torque remains the same.

But maybe I'm getting stuck here. Let me go back to part (i)(a). I think the correct approach is to calculate X_lr using the stalling speed, then find s_b.

Wait, another formula I found: The locked-rotor reactance X_lr can be calculated using X_lr = (4π²f²L) where L is the inductance. But without L, I can't calculate it. Alternatively, perhaps I can find X_lr using the fact that the starting current is I_r = E2/(R2 + X_lr), but I don't have E2 yet.

Wait, no, E2 is given in part (ii) as 112 V. So in part (ii), E2 is 112 V. So for part (i), I don't have E2, but perhaps I can relate it.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the rotor's impedance using the stalling condition. When the rotor is stalled, the current is I2 = V2/(R2 + X_lr). But V2 is the rotor voltage, which is E2 = s * V1, where V1 is the stator voltage. But without V1, I can't find V2.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should try to find X_lr using the formula for the locked-rotor current. The locked-rotor current I2 is given by I2 = (V2) / (R2 + j X_lr). But without V2, I can't find I2.

Wait, perhaps I should use the fact that the stator voltage V1 is related to the rotor voltage V2. The rotor voltage is V2 = V1 - I1 a, where a is the slip, but at standstill, a=1, so V2 = V1 - I1. But without knowing I1, it's hard to proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for the starting current. The starting current is I_r = (V1) / (R1 + (R2 + j X_lr)/k), where k is the ratio of the stator and rotor resistances. But without knowing R1 or k, I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps I should look for another approach. Let's consider that the motor has 8 poles and 60 Hz, so synchronous speed is 900 rpm. The stalling speed is 650 rpm, so slip s = (900-650)/900 ≈ 0.2778. At this point, the torque is maximum, so s_1 = 0.2778.

Using s_1 = R2/(X2 + R2), we can solve for X2. So 0.2778 = 0.3/(X2 + 0.3). Rearranging:

X2 + 0.3 = 0.3 / 0.2778 ≈ 1.08 → X2 ≈ 0.78 ohms.

Now, using this X2, the breakdown slip s_b is s_b = R2²/(X2² + R2²) = (0.3)^2 / (0.78^2 + 0.3^2) ≈ 0.09 / (0.6084 + 0.09) ≈ 0.09 / 0.6984 ≈ 0.1289. But none of the options have s_b around 0.13. So perhaps I'm using the wrong formula for s_b.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for s_b is s_b = (R2)^2/( (X2)^2 + R2^2 ), but that's what I did. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that X2 is not just the rotor reactance but includes some other factor, like the mutual inductance. Alternatively, perhaps X_lr is different from X2. Wait, no, X2 at standstill is X_lr, so X2 = X_lr.

Wait, maybe I should check the options again. If I take X_lr as 1.08 ohms (option G), then s_1 = R2/(X2 + R2) = 0.3/(1.08 + 0.3) ≈ 0.3/1.38 ≈ 0.2178. But the slip based on stalling speed is 0.2778, so this doesn't match. So option G can't be correct.

Looking at option B: s_b=0.31, X_lr=1.7 ohms. Let's see what s_1 would be with X2=1.7:

s_1 = 0.3/(1.7 + 0.3) = 0.3/2 = 0.15. But the stalling speed gives s_1=0.2778, so this doesn't match. So option B is out.

Option I: s_b=0.3, X_lr=1.5. Then s_1 = 0.3/(1.5 + 0.3)=0.3/1.8≈0.1667. Again, doesn't match 0.2778.

Option E: s_b=0.33, X_lr=1.6. s_1=0.3/(1.6+0.3)=0.3/1.9≈0.1579. No match.

Option F: s_b=0.5, X_lr=2.1. s_1=0.3/(2.1 +0.3)=0.3/2.4=0.125. No.

Option H: s_b=0.4, X_lr=1.2. s_1=0.3/(1.2+0.3)=0.3/1.5=0.2. Closer, but still lower than 0.2778.

Option C: s_b=0.25, X_lr=0.95. s_1=0.3/(0.95+0.3)=0.3/1.25=0.24. Closer, but still not 0.2778.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that X_lr isn't the same as X2. Maybe I'm confusing X2 and X_lr. Wait, no, X2 at standstill is X_lr. So perhaps I'm stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for s_b is s_b = R2/(X2 + R2) * (R2/(X2))². Let's try that with X2=0.78:

s_b = 0.2778 * (0.3/0.78)^2 ≈ 0.2778 * (0.3846)^2 ≈ 0.2778 * 0.1479 ≈ 0.0413, which is too low.

Alternatively, perhaps s_b is calculated as s_b = (R2/(X2))^2 * s_1. So with R2=0.3, X2=0.78, s_1=0.2778:

s_b = (0.3/0.78)^2 * 0.2778 ≈ (0.3846)^2 * 0.2778 ≈ 0.1479 * 0.2778 ≈ 0.0413. Still too low.

I'm not making progress here. Maybe I should look at the options and see which one has a rotor frequency at maximum torque that matches our earlier calculation of approximately 16.7 Hz. Looking at the options:

Option G: f_r=16.7 Hz → yes.
Option A: 17 Hz → close.
Option B: 17.5 Hz → a bit higher.
Option C:15.5 Hz → lower.
Option D:16 Hz → close.
Option E:14 Hz → lower.
Option F:20 Hz → way higher.
Option H:18 Hz → higher.
Option I:15 Hz → lower.
Option J:19 Hz → higher.

So options A, D, G, and maybe others are close. But option G's f_r is exactly 16.7 Hz, which matches our calculation. So perhaps option G is correct for part (i)(c).

If option G is correct for part (i)(c), then the other parts of option G must be correct as well. So for part (i)(a), s_b=0.278, which is the same as s_1. That doesn't make sense because s_b should be higher than s_1. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the breakdown slip is when the power factor becomes 1. So perhaps the rotor current has a power factor of 1 at breakdown. The rotor power factor cosφ = R2/(√(R2^2 + X2^2)). So at breakdown slip, cosφ = R2/(√(R2^2 + X2^2)).

If s_b=0.278, then using X2=1.08 ohms (option G), cosφ = 0.3/(√(0.3^2 +1.08^2)) = 0.3/(√(0.09 +1.1664)) = 0.3/√1.2564 ≈ 0.3/1.121 ≈ 0.267, which is about 0.27. But in option G, the rotor power factor is 0.963, which doesn't match.

Alternatively, perhaps at breakdown, the power factor is maximum, which is when R2 and X2 are equal, making cosφ=0.707. But that's not matching any of the options.

I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should make an educated guess based on the options. Since option G has f_r=16.7 Hz, which matches our calculation, and its X_lr=1.08, which would give s_1=0.3/(1.08+0.3)=0.3/1.38≈0.2178, but our s_1 is 0.2778, so that doesn't match. Therefore, option G can't be correct.

Looking at other options, option B has X_lr=1.7 ohms. Let's see:

s_1 = 0.3/(1.7 +0.3) = 0.3/2=0.15. But our s_1 is 0.2778, so no match.

Option I: X_lr=1.5 ohms. s_1=0.3/(1.5+0.3)=0.3/1.8=0.1667. No.

Option D: X_lr=1.3 ohms. s_1=0.3/(1.3+0.3)=0.3/1.6=0.1875. Closer but still lower.

Option H: X_lr=1.2 ohms. s_1=0.3/(1.2+0.3)=0.3/1.5=0.2. Closer, but still lower than 0.2778.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that X_lr is not the same as X2. Maybe X2 is different. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for X_lr based on the motor's parameters, like the number of poles and frequency.

Wait, another approach: The locked-rotor reactance can be calculated using X_lr = (4π²f²L) where L is the inductance. But without L, perhaps I can find L using the rotor resistance R2 and the rotor's resistance formula R2 = ρ * (length/area). But without knowing the physical parameters, this isn't possible.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that the starting current I_r is E2/(R2 + X_lr). In part (ii)(c), they ask for the starting current, which would be I_r = 112 V / (0.3 + X_lr). But without knowing X_lr, I can't compute it yet.

Wait, but in part (i)(b), we're to find X_lr. So perhaps I can express I_r in terms of X_lr and see if it matches any of the options.

But I'm not sure. Maybe I should make a guess based on the options. Since option G's f_r matches our calculation, and it's the only one with 16.7 Hz, perhaps it's the correct choice despite the earlier discrepancy with s_1. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating s_1.

Wait, perhaps s_1 is not (synchronous - stalling)/synchronous, but rather s_1 = (synchronous - speed at maximum torque)/synchronous. Which is what I did earlier, so that should be correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for s_1 is different. Another formula I found is s_1 = (R2)/(X2 + R2). So with R2=0.3 and X2= X_lr, s_1 =0.3/(X_lr +0.3).

We have s_1 = (900-650)/900=250/900≈0.2778.

So:

0.2778 = 0.3/(X_lr + 0.3)

X_lr +0.3 =0.3 /0.2778≈1.08 → X_lr≈0.78 ohms.

But none of the options have X_lr≈0.78. So perhaps none of the options are correct, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing a factor. Maybe X_lr is the per-phase reactance, and I need to consider the number of phases. Wait, the motor is three-phase, so perhaps X_lr is per-phase, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the reactance as X_lr = (4π²f²L) where L is the inductance per phase. Without L, I can't proceed, but perhaps I can relate it to R2.

Wait, another formula: The rotor's resistance R2 and reactance X2 are related through the rotor's impedance. If the rotor is a circle, then X2= (4πfM), where M is the mutual inductance. But without M, I can't compute it.

I think I'm stuck here. Given the time I've spent, I'll have to make an educated guess. Based on the rotor frequency calculation matching option G, I'll go with option G for part (i)(c). Then, for part (i)(a), s_b=0.278, which is the same as s_1, which doesn't make sense, but perhaps the options have a mistake. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the breakdown slip.

In the end, I'll choose option G because its rotor frequency matches, and the other parts might be correct despite my confusion.

The problem involves calculating various parameters of an induction motor. For part (i)(a), the breakdown slip \( s_b \) is determined using the formula \( s_b = \frac{R_2^2}{X_2^2 + R_2^2} \), where \( R_2 \) is the rotor resistance per phase and \( X_2 \) is the rotor reactance. The stalling speed of 650 rpm gives the slip at maximum torque \( s_1 = \frac{900 - 650}{900} \approx 0.2778 \). Using \( s_1 = \frac{R_2}{X_2 + R_2} \), \( X_2 \) is calculated as approximately 0.78 Ω. Substituting into the \( s_b \) formula gives \( s_b \approx 0.1289 \), but this value does not match any option.

For part (i)(b), the locked-rotor reactance \( X_{lr} \) is the same as \( X_2 \) at standstill. However, none of the options match the calculated \( X_2 \) of 0.78 Ω. For part (i)(c), the rotor frequency at maximum torque is \( f_r = s \cdot f \), where \( f = 60 \, \text{Hz} \). Substituting \( s = 0.2778 \) gives \( f_r \approx 16.7 \, \text{Hz} \), which matches option G.

Considering the rotor frequency matches option G and despite discrepancies in other parameters, option G is selected as the most consistent choice.
