Okay, so I have this chemistry problem about activation energy, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me see what I remember from my notes. The question gives me two temperatures and the times it takes for a reaction to reach 20% completion. I need to find the activation energy, E_a.

Hmm, I think this involves the Arrhenius equation. The Arrhenius equation relates the rate constant k to the temperature and activation energy. The equation is k = A * exp(-E_a/(R*T)), where R is the gas constant, T is the temperature in Kelvin, and A is the pre-exponential factor.

But wait, the problem gives me times instead of rate constants. How do I relate time to the rate constant? Oh right, the rate law for a reaction can be expressed as rate = k [A], assuming it's a first-order reaction. But wait, the reaction is 20% complete. Hmm, maybe I need to find the rate constants first.

Wait, if the reaction is 20% complete, that means 20% of the reactant has been consumed. Let's say the initial concentration is [A]₀. At time t, the concentration [A] = [A]₀ - 0.2 [A]₀ = 0.8 [A]₀. For a first-order reaction, the integrated rate law is ln([A]₀/[A]) = kt. So, ln(1/0.8) = kt. That would give me kt = ln(1.25). Let's calculate that: ln(1.25) is approximately 0.223. So, k = 0.223 / t.

But wait, wait, the times given are at two different temperatures. So I can calculate k1 and k2 for each temperature, then use the Arrhenius equation to relate them. Right, because k = A * exp(-E_a/(R*T)), so taking the ratio of k2/k1 would eliminate A.

Let me write down the given data:

At T1 = 300 K, time t1 = 12.6 min.
At T2 = 340 K, time t2 = 3.20 min.

Since k is inversely proportional to time (because k = (ln(1.25))/t), I can write k1 = ln(1.25)/t1 and k2 = ln(1.25)/t2.

So k2/k1 = (ln(1.25)/t2) / (ln(1.25)/t1) )= t1/t2.

Wait, that simplifies to k2/k1 = t1 / t2. So t1 is 12.6 min and t2 is 3.20 min, so t1/t2 is 12.6/3.2 ≈ 3.9375. So k2 is about 3.9375 times k1. Wait, but since k is inversely proportional to time, if the time is shorter, the rate is faster, so k is larger. So when T increases, k should increase, which makes sense because higher temperature usually speeds up reactions.

Now, using Arrhenius for k1 and k2:

k1 = A * exp(-E_a/(R*T1))
k2 = A * exp(-E_a/(R*T2))

Dividing k2 by k1:

k2/k1 = exp( (E_a/R) (1/T1 - 1/T2) ) )

Wait, wait, let me make sure of that. Taking the ratio:

k2/k1 = [exp(-E_a/(R T2))] / [exp(-E_a/(R T1))] )
= exp( E_a/(R) (1/(T1) - 1/(T2)) ) )

Wait, no, because:

exp(-E_a/(R T2)) / exp(-E_a/(R T1)) ) = exp( [ -E_a/(R T2) + E_a/(R T1) ] ) )

= exp( E_a/(R) (1/(T1) - 1/(T2)) )

So taking natural logs on both sides:

ln(k2/k1) = (E_a/R) (1/T1 - 1/T2)

I have k2/k1 as 3.9375, so ln(3.9375) ≈ 1.37.

So 1.37 = (E_a / R) (1/300 - 1/340 )

Let me compute 1/300 - 1/340. Let's calculate that:

1/300 ≈ 0.0033333
1/340 ≈ 0.0029412
Subtracting: 0.0033333 - 0.0029412 = 0.0003921.

So 1.37 = (E_a / 8.314) * 0.0003921

Wait, R is 8.314 J/(mol*K), right? So I can plug that in.

So solving for E_a:

E_a = (1.37 * 8.314) / 0.0003921

Let me compute numerator first: 1.37 * 8.314 ≈ 11.396.

Denominator: 0.0003921.

So E_a ≈ 11.396 / 0.0003921 ≈ Let's see, 11.396 ÷ 0.0003921.

Let me calculate that:

0.0003921 is approximately 3.921e-4.

So 11.396 / 0.0003921 ≈ 11,396 / 0.3921 ≈ Let me compute 11,396 ÷ 0.3921.

Wait, wait, 11,396 ÷ 0.3921 = let me compute:

0.3921 * 29,000 = 0.3921 * 30,000 = 11,763, which is higher than 11,396. So maybe around 29,000?

Wait, 0.3921 * 29,000 = 29,000 * 0.3921 = let's compute:

29,000 * 0.3 = 8,700
29,000 * 0.09 = 2,610 → 8,700 + 2,610 = 11,310
29,000 * 0.0021 = 60.9 → 11,310 +60.9 = 11,370.9

Hmm, but we have 11,396, so 0.3921 * 29,000 ≈ 11,370.9. The difference is 11,396 - 11,370.9 = 25.1.

So how much more do we need? Each 1 unit adds 0.3921, so 25.1 / 0.3921 ≈ 64. So approximately 29,000 + 64 = 29,064.

So E_a ≈ 29,064 J/mol → 29.06 kJ/mol.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations because I'm a bit confused. Also, I should make sure I didn't make a mistake in the k2/k1 ratio.

Wait, because k is inversely proportional to time, so if T increases, the time decreases because the rate is higher. So at T2=340K, time is shorter (3.2 min) compared to T1=300K (12.6 min). So k2 should be higher than k1, which makes k2/k1 = 3.9375, which is correct.

Wait, then when I took the natural log of (k2/k1)=3.9375, that's correct. And then I substituted into the equation.

Wait, but let me recheck the calculation of 1/300 - 1/340. So 1/300 is 0.0033333... and 1/340 is approximately 0.002941176. Subtracting gives 0.000392154.

So, plugging back into the equation:

ln(k2/k1) = (E_a/R) (1/T1 - 1/T2) → 1.37 = (E_a / 8.314) * 0.000392154.

So E_a = (1.37 * 8.314) / 0.000392154.

Calculating numerator: 1.37 * 8.314 ≈ 11.397.

Denominator: 0.000392154.

E_a ≈ 11.397 / 0.000392154 ≈ Let's compute that more accurately.

Divide 11.397 by 0.000392154.

Hmm, 1 / 0.000392154 ≈ 2550. So 11.397 * 2550 ≈ Let's compute 10 *2550=25,500, 1.397 *2550= approx 1.397*2500=3492.5, plus 1.397*50=69.85 → 3492.5+69.85=3562.35. So total E_a ≈ 25,500 + 3,562.35 ≈ 29,062.35 J/mol → 29.06 kJ/mol.

Looking at the options, option I is 29.06 kJ, which matches this. So the answer should be I.

To calculate the activation energy \( E_a \), we use the Arrhenius equation and the given data. The reaction times at two temperatures indicate the rate constants \( k_1 \) and \( k_2 \), which are inversely proportional to the times. Using the Arrhenius equation in its ratio form and solving for \( E_a \) yields approximately 29.06 kJ/mol.
