Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy change for the dissociation of gaseous hydrochloric acid in water. Hmm, let me try to work through this step by step.

First, I remember that the enthalpy change of a reaction can be calculated using the heats of formation (ΔHf°) of the products and reactants. The formula for that is ΔH°_reaction = Σ ΔHf°(products) - Σ ΔHf°(reactants).

The reaction given is HCl(g) → H⁺(aq) + Cl⁻(aq). So, I need to identify the reactants and products here. The reactant is HCl gas, and the products are H⁺ and Cl⁻ ions in aqueous solution.

Now, looking at the heats of formation provided:
- HCl(g) has a ΔHf° of -87.54 Btu/mole.
- H⁺(aq) has a ΔHf° of 0 Btu/mole.
- Cl⁻(aq) has a ΔHf° of -158.8 Btu/mole.

Wait, I'm a bit confused about aqueous ions. I think their standard enthalpies of formation are given as the energy released when forming the ions from their standard states. So, H⁺ in solution is formed from H₂(g) and Cl⁻ from Cl₂(g), I suppose.

So applying the formula: ΔH° = [ΔHf°(H⁺) + ΔHf°(Cl⁻)] - [ΔHf°(HCl)].

Plugging in the numbers:
ΔH° = [0 + (-158.8)] - (-87.54) → [ -158.8 ] + 87.54.

Wait, that would be -158.8 + 87.54, which is -71.26 Btu. So the enthalpy change is negative, meaning it's exothermic.

Looking at the options, option H is -71.26 Btu. So I think that's the correct answer. But wait, let me double-check the signs because sometimes I get confused with enthalpy changes.

Another way to think: The reaction is breaking apart HCl into ions. If HCl is a stable molecule, breaking it would require energy, but wait, the ΔHf of HCl is negative, meaning it's more stable than the elements. So when it dissociates, the process might require energy, making the reaction endothermic. Wait, but my calculation gave a negative ΔH°, which is exothermic. Hmm, that seems conflicting.

Wait, maybe I got the reaction backwards. Let me think again. The reaction is HCl(g) → H⁺(aq) + Cl⁻(aq). The standard enthalpy of formation for HCl(g) is -87.54, which is the energy released when HCl is formed from its elements. So when HCl dissociates, it's the reverse of forming HCl. So the enthalpy change for dissociation would be the opposite of the formation.

Wait, but that might not be correct. Let me go back to the formula. The standard reaction enthalpy is calculated as sum of products minus reactants. So in this case, products are H⁺ and Cl⁻, and the reactant is HCl.

So, products' sum: 0 (H⁺) + (-158.8) (Cl⁻) = -158.8.

Reactants' sum: -87.54 (HCl).

So ΔH° = (-158.8) - (-87.54) = -158.8 + 87.54 = -71.26 Btu.

Wait, that's what I did before. So the calculation is correct. So the reaction releases 71.26 Btu, making it exothermic. But I thought that breaking bonds would usually require energy, which would make it endothermic. Hmm, maybe because the ions are more stable in water, so the process releases energy.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Let me consider the standard enthalpy of formation for the ions. The H⁺ and Cl⁻ are in aqueous solution, so their formation includes the dissolution of HCl gas. Wait, actually, HCl(g) dissociating in water is HCl(g) → H⁺(aq) + Cl⁻(aq). So the standard way to calculate this is using the enthalpies of formation of the products and reactant.

Wait, but another approach could be to think about the dissolution of HCl. The standard enthalpy of formation of HCl(g) is given, and when it dissolves, it dissociates into ions. The enthalpy change for that reaction would be the sum of the ions' formation minus the HCl's formation.

Wait, but the H⁺ and Cl⁻ ions in solution are formed from their respective elements, not from HCl. So maybe I'm confusing the dissolution with the formation. Let me try to outline the steps.

Formation reactions:
- H₂(g) + Cl₂(g) → 2 HCl(g); ΔHf° = 2*(-87.54) = -175.08 Btu.
- H₂(g) → 2 H⁺(aq) + 2 e⁻; but wait, this might not be the right way. Alternatively, the formation of H⁺(aq) from H₂(g) in solution.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. The correct approach is to use the given ΔHf values directly.

So the reaction is HCl(g) → H⁺(aq) + Cl⁻(aq).

So, the calculation is:

ΔH° = [ (1 mol)(0) + (1 mol)(-158.8) ] - [ (1 mol)(-87.54) ]

Which is (0 -158.8) - (-87.54) = (-158.8) +87.54 = -71.26 Btu.

So the enthalpy change is -71.26 Btu, which is exothermic. So the correct answer should be H: -71.26 Btu.

The enthalpy change for the dissociation of gaseous hydrochloric acid is calculated using the formula:

\[
\Delta H^\circ_{\text{reaction}} = \sum \Delta H_f^\circ(\text{products}) - \sum \Delta H_f^\circ(\text{reactants})
\]

For the reaction \( \text{HCl(g)} \rightarrow \text{H}^+(aq) + \text{Cl}^-(aq) \), the heats of formation are:

- \( \Delta H_f^\circ(\text{HCl(g)}) = -87.54 \, \text{Btu/mol} \)
- \( \Delta H_f^\circ(\text{H}^+(aq)) = 0 \, \text{Btu/mol} \)
- \( \Delta H_f^\circ(\text{Cl}^-(aq)) = -158.8 \, \text{Btu/mol} \)

Substituting into the formula:

\[
\Delta H^\circ_{\text{reaction}} = [0 + (-158.8)] - (-87.54) = -158.8 + 87.54 = -71.26 \, \text{Btu}
\]

The negative value indicates the reaction is exothermic. Therefore, the correct answer is:

H: -71.26 Btu.
