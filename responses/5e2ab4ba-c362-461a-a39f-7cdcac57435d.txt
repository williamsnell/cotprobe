Answer:

Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to find the mole fraction of a solute in a benzene solution. Let's see what I remember about this.

The problem says that 20.0 grams of a non-volatile solute is dissolved in 100 grams of benzene at 30°C. The vapor pressure of this solution is 13.4 torr lower than that of pure benzene. The vapor pressure of pure benzene at 30°C is given as 121.8 torr. I need to find the mole fraction of the solute.

Hmm, right. Since the solute is non-volatile, it doesn't contribute to the vapor pressure. So the decrease in vapor pressure is solely due to the solute. That makes sense because the solute lowers the vapor pressure of the solvent (benzene) via Raoult's Law.

Raoult's Law states that the partial vapor pressure of the solvent (benzene) in the solution is equal to the mole fraction of the solvent multiplied by the vapor pressure of pure solvent. So, the equation should be:

P_solution = X_solute * P_pure

Wait, no, wait. Wait, Raoult's Law is P = X_solvent * P_pure. Because the solvent is what's evaporating. So the vapor pressure of the solution is X_solvent * P_pure. But wait, the problem says the solution's vapor pressure is 13.4 torr lower than pure benzene. So P_solution = P_pure - 13.4.

Let me compute that first. P_pure is 121.8 torr. So P_solution = 121.8 - 13.4 = 108.4 torr.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, the solution's vapor pressure is 13.4 torr lower, so P_solution = 121.8 - 13.4 = 108.4 torr. Got that.

Now, according to Raoult's Law, P_solution = X_solvent * P_pure. So X_solvent = P_solution / P_pure.

Plugging in the numbers: X_solvent = 108.4 / 121.8. Let me calculate that.

108.4 ÷ 121.8 ≈ 0.89.

Wait, 121.8 times 0.89 is around 108.3, so that's close. So X_solvent is approximately 0.89.

But wait, the question asks for the mole fraction of the solute, not the solvent. Oh right, because the mole fraction of the solute plus solvent equals 1. So X_solute = 1 - X_solvent.

So X_solute = 1 - 0.89 = 0.11.

Wait, but let me check the calculation more accurately. Let's compute 108.4 divided by 121.8.

Let me compute 108.4 / 121.8:

Well, 121.8 * 0.89 is 108.3, as I thought. So X_solvent ≈ 0.89.

So X_solute ≈ 0.11.

Looking at the options, I see option C is 0.111, which is approximately 0.11. Hmm, but wait, maybe I made a mistake somewhere. Let me check again.

Wait, let me calculate 108.4 / 121.8 precisely.

Let me do that division step by step.

121.8 = 1218/10.

108.4 = 1084/10.

So 1084/10 ÷ 1218/10 = 1084/1218.

Simplify this fraction.

Divide numerator and denominator by 2: 542/609.

Let me compute 542 ÷ 609.

Well, 609 × 0.89 is 541. So 0.89 is about 542/609.

So X_solvent ≈ 0.89, so X_solute = 0.11.

Wait, but I'm getting 0.11, but maybe I should check if this is accurate enough.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Let me do 108.4 divided by 121.8.

121.8 × 0.89 = 108.3, as before. So the difference is 108.4 - 108.3 = 0.1 torr. So that's 0.1/121.8 = 0.000821. So X_solvent ≈ 0.89 + 0.000821 ≈ 0.890821.

So X_solute = 1 - 0.890821 ≈ 0.109179, which is approximately 0.1092.

Looking at the options, the closest is option E: 0.105, option J:0.115, option C: 0.111.

Wait, 0.1092 is about 0.109, which is approximately 0.11, but perhaps more accurately, 0.109 is closer to 0.11 than to 0.105 or 0.115.

Wait, let me check the options again. The options are:

A: 0.123

B: 0.130

C: 0.111

D: 0.092

E: 0.105

F: 0.098

G: 0.150

H: 0.085

I: 0.075

J: 0.115

So 0.109 is between E (0.105) and J (0.115). Hmm, 0.109 is 0.109, so 0.109 is closer to 0.11 than to 0.105. But none of the options is exactly 0.109. The closest is option C: 0.111, which is 0.111. But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, wait a second. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate using the exact formula.

The formula for the mole fraction of the solute is:

X_solute = (P_pure - P_solution) / P_pure.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, X_solute is (moles solute) / (moles solute + moles solvent). And according to Raoult's Law, P_solution = X_solvent * P_pure.

So X_solvent = P_solution / P_pure.

Thus, X_solute = 1 - (P_solution / P_pure).

So X_solute = 1 - (108.4 / 121.8).

Let me compute 108.4 ÷ 121.8.

Let me do this division more accurately.

121.8 × 0.89 = 108.342.

So 108.4 is 108.4 - 108.342 = 0.058 higher.

So 0.058 / 121.8 = approximately 0.000476.

So X_solvent ≈ 0.89 + 0.000476 ≈ 0.890476.

Thus, X_solute ≈ 1 - 0.890476 ≈ 0.109524.

Which is approximately 0.1095, or 0.110 when rounded to three decimal places.

Looking at the options, option C is 0.111, which is higher than 0.1095, but perhaps the calculation has a more precise value.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let's think again: the vapor pressure drop is 13.4 torr, so the solution's vapor pressure is 121.8 - 13.4 = 108.4 torr.

Then, X_solvent = 108.4 / 121.8.

Let me compute that precisely.

Let me compute 108.4 / 121.8.

Divide numerator and denominator by 2: 54.2 / 60.9.

Let me compute 54.2 ÷ 60.9.

So 60.9 × 0.89 = approximately 54.2.

Wait, 60.9 × 0.89: 60 × 0.89 = 53.4, 0.9 × 0.89 = 0.801, so total 53.4 + 0.801 = 54.201. So 54.2 ÷ 60.9 = 0.89.

So X_solvent = 0.89, so X_solute = 0.11.

Wait, but the precise calculation is 0.890476, so X_solute is 0.109524, which is approximately 0.1095.

Looking at the options, the closest is option E: 0.105, option C: 0.111, and option J: 0.115.

Wait, 0.1095 is closer to 0.11 than to 0.105 or 0.111. So 0.1095 is approximately 0.11, but the options don't have 0.11. The closest is C:0.111.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

Alternatively, maybe I should approach it from the moles. Let's calculate the moles of benzene and the solute.

The solute is 20.0 grams. Let's find its molar mass. Wait, but wait, the problem doesn't specify the solute. Hmm. Oh, but wait, perhaps I don't need it because the mole fraction only depends on the moles. But since the solute is non-volatile, perhaps it's not needed. Wait, no, no, in this case, we can calculate the mole fraction without knowing the molar mass of the solute because we're using the vapor pressure depression to find the mole fraction.

Wait, another approach: using the formula for vapor pressure depression.

The formula is ΔP = P_pure - P_solution = X_solute * P_pure.

Wait, no, wait. Because Raoult's law says P_solution = X_solvent * P_pure. So the drop in vapor pressure is P_pure - P_solution = P_pure - X_solvent * P_pure = P_pure(1 - X_solvent) = X_solute * P_pure.

So ΔP = X_solute * P_pure.

So X_solute = ΔP / P_pure.

Wait, that makes sense.

So ΔP is 13.4 torr.

P_pure is 121.8 torr.

So X_solute = 13.4 / 121.8.

Calculating that: 13.4 ÷ 121.8.

Let me compute that.

121.8 × 0.11 = 13.398, which is very close to 13.4. So 13.4 / 121.8 ≈ 0.11.

So X_solute ≈ 0.11.

But wait, precisely, 13.4 ÷ 121.8.

Let me compute 13.4 ÷ 121.8.

13.4 ÷ 121.8 = (134/10) ÷ (1218/10) )= 134/1218.

Simplify: divide numerator and denominator by 2: 67/609.

Now compute 67 ÷ 609.

Well, 609 × 0.11 = 66.99. So 67 ÷ 609 ≈ 0.110016.

So X_solute ≈ 0.110016, which is approximately 0.1100.

Looking at the options, option C is 0.111, which is 0.111, and option E is 0.105, which is lower.

Wait, 0.1100 is approximately 0.110, so the closest option is C: 0.111, but wait, it's a bit higher than 0.11. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something in the calculation.

Wait, but wait a minute, maybe I should calculate it more accurately.

Wait, 13.4 ÷ 121.8.

Let me compute:

121.8 × 0.11 = 13.398.

So 13.4 is 0.002 more than 13.398.

So 0.002 ÷ 121.8 = approximately 0.000016.

So total X_solute is 0.11 + 0.000016 ≈ 0.110016, which is approximately 0.1100.

So 0.1100 is about 0.110, so the closest option is C:0.111, but that's 0.001 higher. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the formula should be X_solute = (ΔP) / P_pure, but that's what I used.

Wait, perhaps the confusion comes from whether it's X_solute or X_solvent. Wait, in the formula ΔP = X_solute * P_pure.

Wait, if the solution's vapor pressure is lower by 13.4, so ΔP = 13.4 = X_solute * 121.8.

So X_solute = 13.4 / 121.8 ≈ 0.1100.

So the mole fraction is approximately 0.1100, which is 0.110. Looking at the options, the closest is C:0.111, which is 0.111.

Wait, but perhaps I should check the options again. The options are:

A: 0.123

B: 0.130

C: 0.111

D: 0.092

E: 0.105

F: 0.098

G: 0.150

H: 0.085

I: 0.075

J: 0.115

So 0.110 is not an option, but option C is 0.111, which is 0.001 higher. So perhaps the correct answer is C:0.111.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me recheck.

Wait, if X_solute is 0.11, then the mole fraction is 0.11, which is 11%. The closest option is C:0.111, which is 0.111.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the exact value. Let me compute 13.4 / 121.8 precisely.

13.4 ÷ 121.8:

Let me compute 13.4 divided by 121.8.

121.8 goes into 134 once (121.8 × 1 = 121.8). Subtract, we get 12.2. Bring down a zero: 122.0. 121.8 goes into 122.0 once, so we have 1.01 so far.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute it as:

13.4 ÷ 121.8 = (134 ÷ 10) ÷ (1218 ÷ 10) )= 134 ÷ 1218.

Divide numerator and denominator by 2: 67 ÷ 609.

609 goes into 67 zero times. So 0. and then 609 into 670.

609 × 1 = 609. Subtract, 61.

Bring down a zero: 610.

609 goes into 610 once, so we have 0.11.

After that, 610 - 609 = 1. Bring down a zero: 10.

609 goes into 10 zero times. So 0.110.

Wait, but this is getting tedious, but I think 67 ÷ 609 is approximately 0.110016, which is 0.1100.

So approximately 0.1100, which is 0.110.

So the answer should be 0.110, but that's not an option. The closest option is C:0.111.

Wait, perhaps I should consider significant figures. The given data has 20.0 grams (3 sig figs), 100 g (could be 1 or 3, but probably 3 as 100. would have 3), 13.4 (3 sig figs), 121.8 (4 sig figs). So the answer should be to 3 decimal places perhaps.

But the options are given to three decimal places, so I think option C is 0.111, which is 0.111, which is a little higher than 0.110, but perhaps due to rounding.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe I should calculate the mole fraction using moles.

Let me compute the moles of benzene and the solute.

Molar mass of benzene (C6H6) is 78.11 g/mol.

So moles of benzene = 100 g / 78.11 g/mol ≈ 1.28 mol.

Moles of solute: let's call it 'n'. Since the solute's molar mass isn't given, but perhaps we can find it through the mole fraction.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I can find the mole fraction without knowing the solute's molar mass because the vapor pressure change depends only on the mole fraction, not the molar mass. So maybe I don't need the molar mass of the solute.

Wait, but let's see. The mole fraction is X_solute = n_solute / (n_solute + n_benzene).

But since we don't know n_solute (as we don't know the molar mass), perhaps I can express it in terms of the given data.

Wait, but earlier calculation using vapor pressure change gave X_solute ≈ 0.110, so perhaps that's the way to go.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute using both methods to confirm.

Wait, if X_solute is 0.110, then the moles of solute would be:

n_solute = X_solute * (n_solute + n_benzene).

Wait, that's a bit circular, but perhaps I can rearrange.

n_solute = X_solute * (n_solute + n_benzene).

n_solute = X_solute * n_solute + X_solute * n_benzene.

n_solute (1 - X_solute) = X_solute * n_benzene.

n_solute = [X_solute * n_benzene] / (1 - X_solute).

So n_solute = [0.110 * (100 /78.11)] / (1 - 0.110).

Compute that:

n_benzene = 100 /78.11 ≈ 1.28 mol.

0.110 * 1.28 ≈ 0.1408 mol.

Denominator: 1 - 0.110 = 0.890.

So n_solute ≈ 0.1408 / 0.890 ≈ 0.158 mol.

So the solute is 20.0 grams, so molar mass = 20.0 g / 0.158 mol ≈ 126.6 g/mol.

But I don't think that's necessary for the problem, as the mole fraction can be found directly from the vapor pressure change.

So I think the mole fraction is approximately 0.110, which is closest to option C:0.111.

Wait, but wait, earlier calculation using the formula gave X_solute ≈ 0.110016, which is about 0.1100.

So perhaps the correct answer is 0.110, but the options don't have that. The closest is C:0.111.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Let me think again.

Another way: using the formula for mole fraction of the solute based on the lowering in vapor pressure.

The formula is:

ΔP = (mole fraction of solute) * (mole fraction of solvent) * P_pure * M_solvent.

Wait, no, that's not right. The correct formula is ΔP = P_pure - P_solution = X_solute * P_pure.

Because P_solution = X_solvent * P_pure, so ΔP = P_pure - X_solvent * P_pure = P_pure (1 - X_solvent) )= X_solute * P_pure.

So, X_solute = ΔP / P_pure.

Which again gives X_solute = 13.4 / 121.8 ≈ 0.1100.

Thus, the correct answer is approximately 0.110.

Looking at the options, the closest is option C:0.111.

But wait, perhaps I should check if the formula is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should remember that the mole fraction of the solute is given by the formula:

X_solute = (ΔP) / P_pure.

Which gives 13.4 / 121.8 ≈ 0.110.

So, I think the correct answer is approximately 0.110, but since it's not an option, I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should compute X_solute more accurately.

Let me compute 13.4 ÷ 121.8 precisely.

Using a calculator-like approach:

121.8 × 0.11 = 13.398.

Subtracting that from 13.4, the remainder is 0.002.

Now, 0.002 ÷ 121.8 ≈ 0.00001643.

So total X_solute ≈ 0.11 + 0.00001643 ≈ 0.11001643.

So, it's approximately 0.1100, which rounds to 0.110.

But the options don't have 0.110, so perhaps the answer is option C:0.111, which is 0.111, but that's a bit off.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial step. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate using the exact mole counts.

Molar mass of benzene is 78.11 g/mol.

n_benzene = 100 g /78.11 g/mol ≈ 1.28 mol.

n_solute = 20.0 g / Molar mass of solute.

But since the molar mass isn't given, perhaps I can express the mole fraction as:

X_solute = n_solute / (n_solute + n_benzene).

But without knowing M_solute, I can't compute n_solute. So perhaps the earlier approach is the only way.

Wait, but perhaps I can relate it to the lowering in vapor pressure using the formula:

ΔP = (n_solute / (n_solute + n_benzene)) * P_pure.

Which is the same as X_solute * P_pure.

So, again, X_solute = ΔP / P_pure = 13.4 / 121.8 ≈ 0.1100.

So, the mole fraction is approximately 0.110, but the options don't have this. The closest option is C:0.111.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the problem might have used a different approach, such as using the formula with the mass of the solute and solvent, assuming ideal behavior.

Wait, another approach: The formula for the lowering of vapor pressure is given by:

ΔP = (n_solute / (n_solute + n_solvent)) * P_pure.

Which is the same as X_solute * P_pure.

So, X_solute = ΔP / P_pure.

Which again gives 13.4 / 121.8 ≈ 0.110.

So, I think the correct answer is approximately 0.110, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option C:0.111.

Alternatively, perhaps I should check if I made a calculation mistake.

Wait, 13.4 ÷ 121.8.

Let me compute this using another method.

13.4 ÷ 121.8 = ?

Well, 121.8 × 0.11 = 13.398.

So, 0.11 gives 13.398, which is just 0.002 less than 13.4.

So, 0.11 + (0.002 / 121.8) = 0.11 + approximately 0.0000164 = 0.1100164.

So, it's 0.1100, which is 0.110.

But the options don't have this, so perhaps I should choose the closest option, which is option C:0.111.

Alternatively, perhaps I should recalculate using more precise steps.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated earlier. Let me compute 13.4 ÷ 121.8 again.

Let me compute it as a fraction: 134/10 ÷ 1218/10 = 134/1218.

Simplify 134/1218: divide numerator and denominator by 2, we get 67/609.

Now, let me compute 67 ÷ 609.

609 × 0.11 = 66.99.

So, 67 ÷ 609 = 0.11 + (0.01/609) = 0.11 + 0.00001643 ≈ 0.11001643.

So, X_solute ≈ 0.110016.

Rounding to three decimal places, that's 0.110.

But since the options don't have 0.110, I must pick the closest one, which is C:0.111.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option E:0.105, but that would be if X_solute were 0.105, which is lower than our calculation. So I think the correct answer is closer to 0.110, so option C:0.111 is the best choice.
</think>

To determine the mole fraction of the solute, we use the relationship provided by Raoult's Law and the given data. The vapor pressure of pure benzene at 30°C is **121.8 torr**, and the solution's vapor pressure is **13.4 torr lower**, giving a solution vapor pressure of:

\[
P_{\text{solution}} = 121.8 - 13.4 = 108.4 \, \text{torr}.
\]

According to Raoult's Law, the vapor pressure of the solution is related to the mole fraction of the solvent:

\[
P_{\text{solution}} = X_{\text{solvent}} \cdot P_{\text{pure}}.
\]

Solving for \(X_{\text{solvent}}\):

\[
X_{\text{solvent}} = \frac{P_{\text{solution}}}{P_{\text{pure}}} = \frac{108.4}{121.8} \approx 0.89.
\]

The mole fraction of the solute is then:

\[
X_{\text{solute}} = 1 - X_{\text{solvent}} = 1 - 0.89 = 0.11.
\]

To confirm, we use the formula for vapor pressure depression:

\[
\Delta P = X_{\text{solute}} \cdot P_{\text{pure}}.
\]

Rearranging for \(X_{\text{solute}}\):

\[
X_{\text{solute}} = \frac{\Delta P}{P_{\text{pure}}} = \frac{13.4}{121.8} \approx 0.11.
\]

Both methods yield \(X_{\text{solute}} \approx 0.11\). Among the given options, the closest value is **0.111**.

**Answer:** C
