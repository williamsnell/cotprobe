Okay, so I need to find the theoretical speed of sound in hydrogen at 0°C. Hmm, I remember that the speed of sound in a gas depends on its properties like temperature and whether it's monoatomic or diatomic. Oh wait, hydrogen is a diatomic gas, right? Because H2 molecules are diatomic.

The formula for the speed of sound in an ideal gas is v = sqrt(γ * R * T / M), where γ is the adiabatic index, R is the universal gas constant, T is the absolute temperature, and M is the molar mass. Wait, but I think I might have mixed up the formula a bit. Oh right, another version is v = sqrt( (γ * R * T) / M ), but I should double-check that.

Wait, actually, I think the correct formula is v = sqrt( (γ * R * T) / (M) ), but sometimes it's written as v = sqrt( (γ * R * T) / M ), where M is the molar mass. Yeah, that makes sense.

Given that, let's plug in the values. The temperature is 0°C, which is 273.15 K. Oh, wait, no, 0°C is 273 K exactly, right? Because 0 degrees Celsius equals 273.15 Kelvin, but sometimes approximated as 273 K for simplicity.

Hydrogen's molar mass M is given as 2.016 g/mol. Wait, but R is usually in J/(mol·K), so I need to make sure the units are consistent. R is 8.314 J/(mol·K). But wait, another value I've heard is R=0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K), but that's for gas law calculations. Here, since we're dealing with m/s, which uses SI units, I should use R=8.314 J/(mol·K).

Wait, but the units for R when using this formula should be in terms of m^2/(s^2·K), because the speed v is in m/s. Let me think: M is in kg/mol, right? Because 2.016 g/mol is 0.002016 kg/mol. So M = 0.002016 kg/mol.

Now, putting it all together:

v = sqrt( (γ * R * T) / M )

Given γ = 1.40 for diatomic gases (which I think is correct because diatomic gases have higher γ than monoatomic ones, like 7/5=1.4).

So let's compute each part step by step.

First, compute the numerator: γ * R * T.

γ = 1.40

R = 8.314 J/(mol·K) → but wait, in the formula, since v is in m/s, I think R should be in terms that when multiplied by T (K) and divided by M (kg/mol), gives (m/s)^2. Let me check the units:

R has units of J/(mol·K) = (kg·m²/s²)/(mol·K). So when I multiply R by T (K), I get kg·m²/(mol·s²). Then multiply by γ (dimensionless) → same units.

Then divide by M (kg/mol), so:

[ (γ * R * T) ] has units (kg·m²/(mol·s²)) → divided by kg/mol → gives m²/s². Then the square root gives m/s. So the units work out.

So compute γ*R*T = 1.40 * 8.314 * 273.

Let me calculate that:

First, 1.40 * 8.314 = let's see, 1.4 *8=11.2, 1.4*0.314=0.4396, so total ≈ 11.6396.

Then multiply by 273: 11.6396 * 273.

Let me compute that:

11 *273 = 3003 (because 10*273=2730, plus 1*273=273 → 2730+273=3003)

0.6396 * 273 ≈ let's see: 0.6 *273=163.8, 0.0396*273≈10.8, so total ≈ 174.6. So 3003 + 174.6 ≈ 3177.6.

So numerator ≈ 3177.6 kg·m²/(mol·s²).

Now, denominator is M = 0.002016 kg/mol.

So the entire fraction is 3177.6 / 0.002016.

Let me compute that: 3177.6 ÷ 0.002016.

Hmm, 0.002016 is approximately 2.016e-3.

So 3177.6 / 2.016e-3 = 3177.6 / 0.002016.

Let me compute 3177.6 ÷ 0.002016.

First, 3177.6 ÷ 0.002 is 3177.6 * 500 = 1,588,800.

But since it's 0.002016, which is a bit more than 0.002, the result will be a bit less than 1,588,800.

Alternatively, perhaps compute as:

3177.6 / 0.002016 = (3177.6 * 1e6) / 2016.

Wait, 3177.6 * 1e6 = 3.1776e9, divided by 2016.

3.1776e9 / 2016 ≈ Let's see, 2016 * 1.575e6 = ?

Wait, 2016 * 1.575 million → 2016 * 1,575,000 = 2016 * 1.575e6.

Wait, but maybe a better approach is to compute 3177.6 / 0.002016.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute as:

3177.6 / 0.002016 = (3177.6 / 0.002) * (1 / 1.008) → since 0.002016 = 0.002 * 1.008.

So 3177.6 / 0.002 = 1,588,800.

Then divide by 1.008: 1,588,800 / 1.008 ≈ let's see.

1,588,800 ÷ 1.008: Well, 1.008 is 1 + 0.008. So 1/1.008 ≈ 0.992063.

So 1,588,800 * 0.992063 ≈ let me compute that.

Approximately, 1,588,800 * 0.992 ≈ 1,588,800 - (1,588,800 * 0.008) → 1,588,800 - 12,710.4 ≈ 1,576,089.6.

So the fraction is approximately 1,576,089.6 m²/s².

Wait, but wait, that's (v)^2, so v is the square root of that.

So v ≈ sqrt(1,576,089.6) → what's that?

Well, sqrt(1,576,089) → let's see, 1256^2 = 1,577,536 (because 1250^2=1,562,500; 1256^2 = (1250 +6)^2 = 1250² + 2*1250*6 +6²=1,562,500 +15,000 +36=1,577,536.

Hmm, but our number is 1,576,089.6, which is a bit less than 1,577,536.

So let's see: 1256^2=1,577,536 → 1,576,089.6 is 1,577,536 - 1,446.4 → so sqrt(1,576,089.6) is about 1256 - (1,446.4)/(2*1256) ≈ 1256 - 1,446.4/(2512) → 1,446.4 / 2512 ≈ 0.575 → so approx 1256 -0.575 ≈ 1255.425 m/s.

Wait, but that can't be right. Because I remember that the speed of sound in hydrogen is higher than in air, which is around 343 m/s at 0°C. But according to this calculation, it's about 1255 m/s, which sounds way too high. Did I make a mistake somewhere?

Wait, I think I messed up the formula. Let me double-check the formula for the speed of sound in gases.

Oh no, wait! The correct formula for the speed of sound in an ideal gas is v = sqrt( (γ * R * T) / (M) ), but wait, sometimes it's written as v = sqrt( (γ * P) / (ρ) ), where P is pressure and ρ is density. Alternatively, using R and M, perhaps I should have used the specific gas constant instead of the universal R.

Wait, another approach: The speed of sound in a gas can also be calculated using v = sqrt( (γ * R * T) / M ), but wait, perhaps I forgot to consider the units correctly.

Wait, let me look up the correct formula to make sure. The formula is v = sqrt( (γ * R * T) / M ), where R is the specific gas constant. Wait, but in this case, R is given as the universal gas constant, but I think the specific gas constant R_specific is R_universal divided by molar mass M. Oh wait, no, R_specific = R_universal / M. So perhaps I should have used R_specific instead, but I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, maybe I should use the formula v = sqrt( (γ * R * T) / (M) ), but perhaps I made a mistake in the units of R. Because R is 8.314 J/(mol·K), and M is in kg/mol, so when you multiply R by T, you get (J/(mol·K)) * K = J/mol → which is (kg·m²/s²)/mol. Then divide by M (kg/mol), so the units become m²/s², and the square root gives m/s. That seems correct.

Wait, but my result seems way too high. Let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation steps.

Wait, perhaps I should recalculate the numerator: γ * R * T = 1.40 * 8.314 * 273.

Let me compute that more accurately.

1.40 * 8.314 = ?

1.4 *8 = 11.2; 1.4 *0.314=0.4396 → total 11.6396.

11.6396 * 273 = ?

Let me compute 11.6396 * 200 = 2327.92

11.6396 *70 = 814.772

11.6396 *3 = 34.9188

Adding them together: 2327.92 + 814.772 = 3142.692; +34.9188 = 3177.6108.

So numerator is 3177.6108.

Denominator M = 0.002016 kg/mol.

So 3177.6108 / 0.002016 = ?

Let me compute that division:

3177.6108 ÷ 0.002016.

I can write this as (3177.6108 / 0.002) * (1 / 1.008).

3177.6108 ÷ 0.002 = 3177.6108 * 500 = 1,588,805.4.

Then, 1,588,805.4 ÷ 1.008 ≈ ?

Well, 1.008 is approximately 1.008.

So 1,588,805.4 ÷ 1.008 ≈ 1,588,805.4 * (1 / 1.008) ≈ 1,588,805.4 * 0.992063.

Calculating that:

1,588,805.4 * 0.992063 ≈ let's approximate:

First, 1,588,805.4 * 0.99 = 1,588,805.4 * (1 - 0.01) = 1,588,805.4 - 15,888.054 ≈ 1,572,917.346.

Then, 1,588,805.4 * 0.002063 ≈ 3,270. So total approx 1,572,917.346 + 3,270 ≈ 1,576,187.346.

So the value inside the square root is approximately 1,576,187 m²/s².

Taking the square root: sqrt(1,576,187) ≈ ?

Well, 1256^2 = 1,577,536, as I thought earlier.

So sqrt(1,576,187) is slightly less than 1256. Let's compute 1255^2 = (1250+5)^2 = 1250² + 2*1250*5 +5² = 1,562,500 + 12,500 +25= 1,575,025.

So 1255^2=1,575,025.

Our value is 1,576,187, which is 1,576,187 -1,575,025=1,162 above 1255^2.

So, 1255 + x)^2 = 1,575,025 + 2*1255*x +x² ≈ 1,576,187.

Assuming x is small, x² is negligible.

So 2*1255*x ≈ 1,162 → x≈1162/(2*1255)≈1162/2510≈0.463.

So sqrt(1,576,187)≈1255.463 m/s.

Wait, that's about 1255 m/s, which seems way too high. I must have made a mistake because the speed of sound in hydrogen is known to be higher than in air, but 1255 m/s is way beyond what I've heard. Wait, no, actually, I might be confusing units. Wait, no, 343 m/s is for air at 0°C, so hydrogen being lighter should have a higher speed.

Wait, let me check online quickly (but since I can't, I'll think). I remember that the speed of sound in hydrogen is around 1270 m/s at 0°C. So perhaps my calculation is correct.

But wait, looking back at the options, option B is 1.60e3, which is 1600 m/s, and option G is 1.45e3 (1450 m/s). My calculation is about 1255, which is close to option C (1.25e3=1250 m/s). But wait, option C is 1.25e3=1250 m/s. My calculation is 1255, which rounds to 1250, so option C is 1.25e3 m/s.

But wait, another thought: perhaps I messed up the units for R. Because sometimes R is given as 8.314 J/(mol·K), but maybe in this formula, R should be in different units.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have used the specific gas constant R_specific, which is R/M. Wait, R_specific = R / M, but in this case, I think I used R correctly.

Wait, another approach: the formula for the speed of sound can also be written as v = sqrt( (γ * P) / (ρ) ), where P is pressure and ρ is density.

At 0°C, the pressure P is 1 atm, which is 101325 Pascals.

Density ρ can be calculated using the ideal gas law: PV = nRT → ρ = (n*M)/V = (P*M)/(R*T).

So ρ = (P * M) / (R*T).

Then, v = sqrt( (γ * P) / (ρ) ) = sqrt( (γ * P * R*T) / (P*M) ) ) → sqrt( (γ R T) / M ), which is the same as before. So my initial approach was correct.

So, perhaps the correct calculation leads to around 1255 m/s, which is closest to option C: 1.25e3 m/s.

Wait, but looking back, the options include B: 1.6e3, which is 1600 m/s, which is higher. Did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the numbers.

Wait, let me recalculate the numerator: γ*R*T.

γ=1.40

R=8.314 J/(mol·K)

T=273 K.

So 1.40 *8.314 = 11.6396.

11.6396 *273 = ?

Let me compute 11.6396 *273:

11 *273 = 3003

0.6396 *273 = let's compute:

0.6 *273=163.8

0.0396 *273 ≈10.8

Total: 163.8 +10.8=174.6

So 3003 + 174.6=3177.6.

So numerator is 3177.6.

Denominator M=0.002016 kg/mol.

So 3177.6 /0.002016 = ?

Let me compute 3177.6 ÷ 0.002016.

0.002016 is 2.016e-3.

So 3177.6 / 2.016e-3 = 3177.6 / 0.002016.

Let me compute this division.

3177.6 ÷ 0.002016 = ?

Well, 0.002016 = 2.016 * 1e-3.

So 3177.6 ÷ (2.016 *1e-3) )= (3177.6 / 2.016) * 1e3.

Compute 3177.6 ÷ 2.016:

Well, 2.016 * 1575 = 3177.6 → because 2.016 *1500=3024, 2.016*75=151.2 → 3024 +151.2=3175.2, which is close but not exact. Let me check:

2.016 * 1575 = ?

2 *1575=3150.

0.016 *1575=25.2.

So total 3150 +25.2=3175.2.

But our numerator is 3177.6, which is 2.4 higher.

So 3175.2 is 2.016 *1575. So 3177.6 is 3175.2 +2.4 → which is 1575 + (2.4/2.016) → 2.4/2.016≈1.19.

So 3177.6 /2.016=1575 +1.19≈1576.19.

So 3177.6 /0.002016=1576.19 *1e3=1,576,190 m²/s².

Then, v= sqrt(1,576,190)≈1255.47 m/s.

So about 1255 m/s. So the closest option is C:1.25e3 m/s=1250 m/s.

But wait, the options include option B as 1.6e3=1600 m/s, which is higher. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, perhaps I should check the formula again. Another formula I've seen is v = sqrt( (γ * R * T) / (M) ), where R is the universal gas constant, M is molar mass in kg/mol, and T is in Kelvin.

Wait, another thought: Maybe I should use R=287 J/(kg·K) instead. Wait, no, R=287 is the specific gas constant for air, which is R_universal divided by molar mass of air. For hydrogen, R_specific would be R_universal / M_H2.

Wait, R_specific = R / M.

So R_specific = 8.314 J/(mol·K) / 0.002016 kg/mol → 8.314 / 0.002016 ≈4127 J/(kg·K).

Then, the formula using R_specific would be v = sqrt( γ * R_specific * T ).

So let's compute that: γ=1.40, R_specific=4127 J/(kg·K), T=273 K.

v = sqrt(1.40 *4127 *273).

Compute 1.40 *4127 =5777.8.

5777.8 *273 = ?

5777.8 *200=1,155,560.

5777.8 *70=404,446.

5777.8 *3=17,333.4.

Adding them: 1,155,560 +404,446 =1,560,006 +17,333.4=1,577,339.4.

So v= sqrt(1,577,339.4) ≈1256 m/s, same as before.

So same result. So the speed is approximately 1255 m/s, which matches option C:1.25e3=1250 m/s.

But wait, the options don't have exactly 1255. The closest is C:1.25e3.

Wait, but looking at the options again:

A:1.00e3 →1000

B:1.60e3 →1600

C:1.25e3 →1250

D:1.50e3 →1500

E:2.00e3 →2000

F:1.75e3 →1750

G:1.45e3 →1450

H:1.10e3 →1100

I:900e3 →900,000, which seems way off.

J:800e3 →800,000, also way off.

So, the correct answer should be around 1255 m/s, which is closest to option C:1.25e3 m/s.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought the speed of sound in hydrogen is about 1270 m/s, but perhaps I'm mixing up numbers. Alternatively, perhaps I made a calculation error.

Wait, let me try another approach. Maybe I should use the formula with pressure and density.

At 0°C and 1 atm, pressure P=101325 Pa.

Density ρ = (P*M)/(R*T) → M=0.002016 kg/mol, R=8.314, T=273.

So ρ= (101325 *0.002016)/(8.314*273).

Compute numerator: 101325 *0.002016.

101325 *0.002 =202.65.

101325 *0.000016=1.6212.

So total≈202.65 +1.6212≈204.2712 kg/m³.

Denominator:8.314 *273≈2269.722.

So ρ≈204.2712 /2269.722≈0.08997 kg/m³.

Then, speed of sound v= sqrt(γ * P / ρ )= sqrt(1.40 *101325 /0.08997).

Compute 1.40 *101325=141,855.

141,855 /0.08997≈1,577,000.

v= sqrt(1,577,000)= approx 1256 m/s.

Same result. So it's 1255-1256 m/s, which is ~1.25e3 m/s.

So the correct option is C:1.25e3 m/s.
</think>

To determine the theoretical speed of sound in hydrogen at 0°C, we use the formula for the speed of sound in an ideal gas:

\[
v = \sqrt{\frac{\gamma R T}{M}}
\]

Where:
- \( \gamma = 1.40 \) (adiabatic index for diatomic gases),
- \( R = 8.314 \, \text{J/(mol·K)} \) (universal gas constant),
- \( T = 273 \, \text{K} \) (temperature at 0°C),
- \( M = 0.002016 \, \text{kg/mol} \) (molar mass of hydrogen).

### Step 1: Compute the numerator \( \gamma R T \)
\[
\gamma R T = 1.40 \times 8.314 \times 273
\]
\[
1.40 \times 8.314 = 11.6396
\]
\[
11.6396 \times 273 = 3177.6108
\]

### Step 2: Divide by \( M \)
\[
\frac{\gamma R T}{M} = \frac{3177.6108}{0.002016} = 1,576,190 \, \text{m}^2/\text{s}^2
\]

### Step 3: Take the square root
\[
v = \sqrt{1,576,190} \approx 1255 \, \text{m/s}
\]

### Step 4: Compare with options
The calculated speed of sound is approximately \( 1255 \, \text{m/s} \), which is closest to option **C: \( 1.25 \times 10^3 \, \text{m/s} \)**.

### Conclusion
The theoretical speed of sound in hydrogen at 0°C is approximately \( 1.25 \times 10^3 \, \text{m/s} \).

**Answer: C**
