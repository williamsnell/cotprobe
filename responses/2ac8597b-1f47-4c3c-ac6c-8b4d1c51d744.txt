Question:

TheAlforsCompany had a beginning inventory of $30,000, Jan 1, 1974. During the year, purchases amounted to $87,500, net sales to $102,000. Assuming that the gross profit rate is 40% of the net sales, what is the ending inventory using the gross profit method of inventory evaluation?

Okay, so I've got this problem about the Alphas Company and their inventory using the gross profit method. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it step by step.

Alright, the question says: The company had a beginning inventory of $30,000 on Jan 1, 1974. During the year, they made purchases totaling $87,500. Net sales were $102,000, and the gross profit rate is 40% of net sales. I need to find the ending inventory using the gross profit method.

Wait, I remember that the gross profit method is used to estimate ending inventory. The basic idea is to calculate the cost of goods sold (COGS) and then subtract that from the goods available for sale to find ending inventory.

So first, I should figure out the cost of goods sold (COGS). I think the formula for that involves the sales and the gross profit percentage. Alternatively, COGS is the cost of all goods sold during the period.

Gross profit is given as a percentage of net sales. So, if the gross profit rate is 40%, then the cost of goods sold would be 100% - 40% = 60% of net sales.

Wait, but wait—no, that might not be correct. Sometimes, the gross profit rate is a percentage of the cost, not the sales. Hmm, I need to clarify that. The question says "gross profit rate is 40% of the net sales." So, that means the gross profit is 40% of net sales. So, the COGS would be 60% of net sales.

Yes, that makes sense because if 40% is gross profit, then 60% is the cost. So, COGS = 60% of $102,000.

Let me calculate that. 60% is 0.6, so 0.6 * 102,000 = 61,200. So COGS is $61,200.

Wait, but sometimes there's a different way. If the gross profit rate is a percentage of cost, then the formula would be different. But the question says it's a percentage of net sales, so I think that's correct. So COGS is 60% of net sales.

Once I have COGS, the ending inventory is calculated by taking the goods available for sale (beginning inventory plus purchases) and subtracting COGS.

So, goods available for sale = beginning inventory + purchases. That's $30,000 + $87,500 = $117,500.

Ending inventory = goods available for sale - COGS = 117,500 - 61,200 = 56,300.

Wait, but let me double-check that. Alternatively, sometimes it's possible to use the gross profit percentage to compute ending inventory, but I think the standard method is to calculate COGS as a percentage of sales.

So, in this case, the calculation seems correct. So the ending inventory would be $56,300.

Looking at the options, option D is $56,300. So that's the answer.

To determine the ending inventory using the gross profit method, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate Cost of Goods Sold (COGS):**
   - Gross profit rate is 40% of net sales.
   - Therefore, COGS is 60% of net sales.
   - Net Sales = $102,000
   - COGS = 60% of $102,000 = 0.6 × 102,000 = $61,200.

2. **Calculate Goods Available for Sale:**
   - Beginning Inventory = $30,000
   - Purchases = $87,500
   - Goods Available for Sale = 30,000 + 87,500 = $117,500.

3. **Determine Ending Inventory:**
   - Ending Inventory = Goods Available for Sale - COGS
   - Ending Inventory = 117,500 - 61,200 = $56,300.

The correct answer is **D: $56,300**.

Answer: D
