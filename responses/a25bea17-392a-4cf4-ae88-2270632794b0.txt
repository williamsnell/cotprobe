Question:

A farmer purchased a new pickup truck from a local automobile dealership. A few weeks later, the farmer was using the truck to haul a load of supplies to his farm. As he drove down a small hill toward an intersection with a stop sign, he applied the brakes, but they failed to work, and the truck did not slow down. The farmer could not stop for the stop sign. He saw a pedestrian crossing the street at the intersection and tried to steer around him, but was unable to do so. The pickup truck struck the pedestrian and seriously injured him. If the injured pedestrian asserts a negligence claim against the auto dealership that sold the truck to the farmer, and if it is conclusively proven that the brake failure resulted from a manufacturing defect in the car, will the pedestrian prevail?

Options:

A: No, because the pedestrian was not a purchaser or user of the truck.
B: Yes, if the manufacturing company had issued a recall for the defect.
C: No, if the farmer was speeding and therefore could not stop in time.
D: Yes, if the defect could have been discovered through the exercise of reasonable care by the auto dealer.
E: No, if the pedestrian was crossing the street illegally.
F: No, if the farmer was negligent in being unable to steer around and avoid hitting the pedestrian.
G: Yes, if the auto dealer was aware of the defect but did not inform the farmer.
H: No, because the farmer should have had the truck inspected before using it for heavy duty work.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether the pedestrian will prevail in his negligence claim against the auto dealership. Let's break down the situation.

First, the farmer bought a new pickup truck from a dealership. A few weeks later, while using it, the brakes failed, causing an accident where he hit a pedestrian. The pedestrian is now suing the dealership. The key point is that the brake failure was due to a manufacturing defect.

I remember that in product liability cases, there are different theories, like negligence, breach of warranty, and strict liability. Here, the question is about negligence, so I should focus on that.

For a negligence claim, the pedestrian (plaintiff) needs to show that the dealership owed a duty of care, breached that duty, and that the breach caused the injury, resulting in damages.

But wait, the dealership is the seller, not the manufacturer. So would the dealership be liable? Typically, in strict liability, all parties in the chain of distribution can be held liable, but negligence is different. The dealership would only be liable if they were negligent in some way.

The question says the defect was a manufacturing defect. If the defect was present when the dealership sold the truck, and the dealership didn't know or should have known about it, maybe they could be liable. But if the defect was unknown and couldn't have been discovered with reasonable care, then maybe not.

Looking at the options:

Option A: No, because the pedestrian wasn't a purchaser or user. But in product liability, sometimes third parties can sue if they are foreseeable users. So A might not be correct.

Option B: Yes, if there was a recall. But the question doesn't say there was a recall; it just says the defect existed. So B might not be the right choice.

Option C: No, if the farmer was speeding. But the question doesn't state that the farmer was speeding. The fact that the brakes failed is the main issue. So C might not be relevant unless the farmer's speeding contributed, but the question doesn't mention it.

Option D: Yes, if the defect could have been discovered through reasonable care by the dealer. That makes sense because if the dealer should have found the defect during their inspection, they might be liable for negligence in not discovering it before sale.

Option E: No, if the pedestrian was crossing illegally. That's a possible defense, but the question doesn't say the pedestrian was illegally crossing. So E might not apply here.

Option F: No, if the farmer was negligent in steering. But the issue is the brake failure, not the farmer's ability to steer. The defect caused the brakes to fail, so F might not be the right answer unless the farmer's negligence contributed, but the question focuses on the dealer's liability.

Option G: Yes, if the dealer was aware of the defect but didn't inform the farmer. That sounds correct because if the dealer knew about the defect, they should have warned the buyer. So G could be the right choice.

Option H: No, if the farmer should have inspected. But the farmer bought a new truck, so he might not have had a duty to inspect for manufacturing defects. That's more of a manufacturer's responsibility.

So between D and G. The question says it's conclusively proven that the defect was from manufacturing. So the dealer's liability would depend on whether they breached their duty. If the dealer should have discovered the defect, then D would be correct. Alternatively, if the dealer knew about the defect, G would apply.

But in the question, it's a manufacturing defect, which is more about the product's design or production. Dealerships are usually not responsible for manufacturing defects unless they knew or should have known about them. So if the defect was something the dealer should have caught during their inspection, then D would apply. If the dealer had no knowledge and couldn't have known, then maybe not.

Wait, the question says "if it is conclusively proven that the brake failure resulted from a manufacturing defect." It doesn't say the dealer knew about it. So the dealer's negligence would be whether they failed to discover the defect during their own inspection. If they should have found it with reasonable care, then they breached their duty. So option D says "Yes, if the defect could have been discovered through the exercise of reasonable care by the auto dealer." That seems correct because the dealer is in the business of selling cars and should inspect for such defects.

Alternatively, option G says "Yes, if the auto dealer was aware of the defect but did not inform the farmer." But the question doesn't state the dealer was aware. So G's condition isn't met because the defect was proven, but whether the dealer knew is another matter.

So the correct answer would be D because the defect could have been discovered through reasonable care by the dealer, making them negligent in not doing so.

The pedestrian's claim against the auto dealership hinges on whether the dealership was negligent. The defect causing the brake failure is a manufacturing defect, and the question is whether the dealership owed a duty to discover this defect before selling the truck. If the defect could have been detected through reasonable care by the dealership, they may be liable for negligence. Therefore, the pedestrian would prevail if the defect was discoverable during the dealership's inspection.

Answer: D
