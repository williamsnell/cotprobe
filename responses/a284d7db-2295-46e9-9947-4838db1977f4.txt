Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because stoichiometry can get tricky. Let me try to break it down step by step. Alright, the problem says a chemist is reacting 2 grams of vanadium oxide (VO) with 5.75 grams of iron(III) oxide (Fe₂O₃) to produce vanadium(V) oxide (V₂O₅) and iron(II) oxide (FeO). I need to find out how many grams of V₂O₅ can be obtained.

Hmm, first things first, I think I need to write the balanced chemical equation. Without that, I can't proceed. Let me try to balance it.

The reactants are VO and Fe₂O₃. The products are V₂O₅ and FeO. So, let's write the unbalanced equation:

VO + Fe₂O₃ → V₂O₅ + FeO

Now, I need to balance the atoms. Let's see. Vanadium (V) is on both sides, so let's count that. On the left, there's one V in VO. On the right, there's two V in V₂O₅. So, I'll need to have two VO molecules on the left to get two V atoms. Let me write that:

2 VO + Fe₂O₃ → V₂O₅ + FeO

Now, let's check oxygen. On the left, each VO has one O, so two O from VO, and Fe₂O₃ has three O. So total O on the left is 2 + 3 = 5 O.

On the right, V₂O₅ has five O, and FeO has one O. So total O is 5 + 1 = 6 O. Hmm, that's more than on the left. So I need to adjust. Maybe I should balance the oxygen by adjusting coefficients.

Wait, maybe I should approach it differently. Let me count each element separately.

Vanadium: 2 on the right (V₂O₅), so I need 2 on the left. So 2 VO.

Iron: 2 Fe in Fe₂O₃ on the left, and each FeO has 1 Fe. So, need 2 FeO on the right to balance Fe.

So, let's adjust:

2 VO + Fe₂O₃ → V₂O₅ + 2 FeO

Now, let's count O.

Left: 2 VO → 2*(1 O) = 2 O. Fe₂O₃ → 3 O. Total O on left: 5.

Right: V₂O₅ →5 O. 2 FeO → 2*(1 O) = 2 O. Total O on right: 5 + 2 =7.

Hmm, that's not balanced. O is 5 on left and 7 on right. I'm missing 2 O on the left. Maybe I need to adjust the coefficients. Alternatively, perhaps I should multiply some of the compounds.

Wait, let me try another approach. Let me see the number of each atom on both sides.

Left side:
- V: 2 (from 2 VO)
- Fe: 2 (from Fe₂O₃)
- O: 2*(1) + 3 =5

Right side:
- V: 2
- Fe: 2 (from 2 FeO)
- O:5 (from V₂O₅) + 2*(1) =7

So O is the problem. To balance O, perhaps I need to adjust the coefficients. Let me see if I can find a multiplier for each compound that balances O.

Let me denote the coefficients as a, b, c, d:

a VO + b Fe₂O₃ → c V₂O₅ + d FeO

Now, balancing V: 2a = 2c ⇒ a = c.

Fe: 2b = d.

O: a*(1) + b*(3) = c*(5) + d*(1).

Since a = c and d = 2b, substitute into O equation:

a + 3b =5a + (2b)(1)
→ a +3b =5a +2b
→ 3b -2b =5a -a
→ b =4a

Let me choose a=1; then b=4, c=1, d=8.

So the equation would be:

1 VO +4 Fe₂O₃ →1 V₂O₅ +8 FeO

Wait, let's check:

V: 1*1 on left, 2 on right? No, because V₂O₅ has 2 V. So a should be 2? Because each VO has one V.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me correct that.

If I have 2 VO on the left, then a=2. Then from V, 2a =2c → c=a → c=2.

Wait, that would give V₂O₅ as 2 V, so that works.

Wait, no. Let's try again. Let me set a as the coefficient for VO, so 2a V on the left. On the right, V₂O₅ has 2 V, so 2a =2 → a=1. So a=1.

Then from Fe: 2b =d.

O: a*(1) + b*3 = c*5 + d*1.

But since a=1 and c=1 (from V), we have:

1 +3b =5*(1) +d.

And d=2b.

Substitute d=2b into the equation:

1 +3b =5 +2b → 3b -2b =5-1 → b=4.

So d=2*4=8.

Thus, the equation is:

1 VO +4 Fe₂O₃ →1 V₂O₅ +8 FeO.

Now, let's check all elements.

V: 1 on left, 2 on right? Wait, V₂O₅ has 2 V, so left side has 1 V from VO. That's not balanced. Oh, I see the mistake. So if a=1, then 1 VO gives 1 V on left, but V₂O₅ has 2 V on right. So that's not balanced. So I must have made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, maybe I should start by balancing V first.

We have VO → V₂O₅. So, to get 2 V on the right, we need 2 VO on the left.

So:

2 VO + ... → V₂O₅ + ...

Now, V is balanced (2 on each side).

Next, Fe: Fe₂O₃ → FeO. Each FeO has one Fe, so we'll need 2 FeO to balance the 2 Fe from Fe₂O₃.

So, let's write:

2 VO + Fe₂O₃ → V₂O₅ + 2 FeO.

Now, let's check O.

Left side: 2*(1 O) from VO =2, plus 3 from Fe₂O₃ =5 O.

Right side: 5 from V₂O₅ + 2*(1 O) from FeO =7 O.

So O isn't balanced. The left has 5, right has 7. To fix this, perhaps we need to adjust the coefficients.

Let me try to make the O balanced. Let's see how much O is in excess on the right. 7 -5=2. So maybe I need to find a multiplier that makes the O's equal.

Alternatively, perhaps I should multiply the entire equation by a factor.

Wait, another approach: Let me write the equation again with 2 VO.

2 VO + Fe₂O₃ → V₂O₅ + 2 FeO.

O: left=5, right=5+2=7.

Hmm, perhaps I can adjust the coefficients of Fe₂O₃ and FeO.

Let me let the coefficients be a for VO, b for Fe₂O₃, c for V₂O₅, d for FeO.

So:

a VO + b Fe₂O₃ → c V₂O₅ + d FeO.

Balancing V: a = 2c.

Fe: 2b = d.

O: a*(1) + b*(3) = c*(5) + d*(1).

From V: a=2c → c=a/2.

From Fe: d=2b.

Substitute into O equation:

a +3b =5*(a/2) + (2b)*1.

Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate fraction:

2a +6b =5a +4b.

Bring terms together:

6b -4b =5a -2a → 2b =3a → b=(3/2)a.

So, a must be a multiple of 2 to make b an integer. Let's choose a=2.

Then, c=1 (since a=2, c=2/2=1).

b=(3/2)*2=3.

d=2b=6.

So the equation becomes:

2 VO +3 Fe₂O₃ →1 V₂O₅ +6 FeO.

Let me check:

V: 2 on left, 2 on right (from V₂O₅).

Fe: 3*2=6 on left, 6 on right (from FeO).

O: 2*1 (from VO) +3*3 (from Fe₂O₃) =2+9=11.

On right: 5 (from V₂O₅) +6*1=6 → total 11. Yes, balanced!

So the balanced equation is:

2 VO + 3 Fe₂O₃ → V₂O₅ + 6 FeO.

Great, now I can proceed with the stoichiometry.

Next step is to find the limiting reagent. The chemist is using 2 grams of VO and 5.75 grams of Fe₂O₃.

I'll need the molar masses.

Molar masses:

VO: V is 50.94 g/mol, O is 16.00, so 50.94 +16.00=66.94 g/mol.

Fe₂O₃: Fe is 55.85, so 2*55.85=111.7. O is 3*16=48. Total 111.7 +48=159.7 g/mol.

V₂O₅: V is 50.94*2=101.88, O is 5*16=80. Total 181.88 g/mol.

FeO: Fe is 55.85, O 16.00. Total 71.85 g/mol.

Now, calculate moles of each reactant.

Moles of VO = mass / molar mass = 2 g /66.94 g/mol ≈ 0.0299 moles.

Moles of Fe₂O₃ =5.75 g /159.7 g/mol ≈0.0360 moles.

Now, from the balanced equation, the mole ratio of VO to Fe₂O₃ is 2:3.

So, let's see how much Fe₂O₃ is needed for the available VO, and vice versa.

If we have 0.0299 moles of VO, how much Fe₂O₃ is needed?

From 2 moles VO →3 moles Fe₂O₃.

So, moles Fe₂O₃ needed = (3/2)*0.0299 ≈0.04485 moles.

But we only have 0.0360 moles of Fe₂O₃. So Fe₂O₃ is the limiting reagent because we don't have enough of it to react with all the VO.

Alternatively, check how much VO is needed for Fe₂O₃.

3 moles Fe₂O₃ →2 moles VO.

Moles of VO needed = (2/3)*0.0360 ≈0.0240 moles.

But we have 0.0299 moles of VO, which is more than 0.0240, so Fe₂O₃ is limiting.

So the reaction will proceed until Fe₂O₃ is consumed, and some VO will remain.

Now, using the limiting reagent Fe₂O₃, let's find out how much V₂O₅ is produced.

From the balanced equation, 3 moles Fe₂O₃ →1 mole V₂O₅.

So moles of V₂O₅ produced = (1/3)* moles of Fe₂O₃.

Moles Fe₂O₃ =0.0360 → moles V₂O₅ =0.0360 /3 =0.0120 moles.

Now, convert moles of V₂O₅ to grams.

Mass = moles * molar mass =0.0120 *181.88 g/mol ≈2.18256 grams.

Looking at the options, option D is 2.18g, which matches this calculation.

Wait, let me double-check the calculations.

Molar mass of VO: 50.94 +16 =66.94 g/mol. 2g /66.94=0.0299 moles.

Fe₂O₃: 5.75 /159.7= approx 0.0360 moles.

Mole ratio Fe₂O₃: VO is 3:2. So for 0.0360 Fe₂O₃, required VO is (2/3)*0.0360=0.0240 moles. Since we have 0.0299, which is more than 0.0240, Fe₂O₃ is limiting.

Thus, V₂O₅ moles=0.0360 /3=0.0120.

Mass=0.0120 *181.88=2.18256g, which rounds to 2.18g. So option D.
</think>

The balanced chemical equation for the reaction is:

\[
2 \, \text{VO} + 3 \, \text{Fe}_2\text{O}_3 \rightarrow \text{V}_2\text{O}_5 + 6 \, \text{FeO}
\]

### Step 1: Molar Masses
- **VO**: \(50.94 + 16.00 = 66.94 \, \text{g/mol}\)
- **Fe₂O₃**: \(2 \times 55.85 + 3 \times 16.00 = 159.70 \, \text{g/mol}\)
- **V₂O₅**: \(2 \times 50.94 + 5 \times 16.00 = 181.88 \, \text{g/mol}\)

### Step 2: Moles of Reactants
- Moles of VO:  
  \[
  \frac{2.00 \, \text{g}}{66.94 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.0299 \, \text{mol}
  \]
- Moles of Fe₂O₃:  
  \[
  \frac{5.75 \, \text{g}}{159.70 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.0360 \, \text{mol}
  \]

### Step 3: Limiting Reagent
From the balanced equation, the mole ratio of VO to Fe₂O₃ is \(2:3\).  
- Moles of Fe₂O₃ needed for 0.0299 mol of VO:  
  \[
  \frac{3}{2} \times 0.0299 \approx 0.04485 \, \text{mol}
  \]
  Since only 0.0360 mol of Fe₂O₃ is available, Fe₂O₃ is the limiting reagent.

### Step 4: Moles of V₂O₅ Produced
From the balanced equation, \(3 \, \text{mol Fe}_2\text{O}_3\) produces \(1 \, \text{mol V}_2\text{O}_5\).  
- Moles of V₂O₅:  
  \[
  \frac{1}{3} \times 0.0360 \approx 0.0120 \, \text{mol}
  \]

### Step 5: Mass of V₂O₅
- Mass of V₂O₅:  
  \[
  0.0120 \, \text{mol} \times 181.88 \, \text{g/mol} \approx 2.18 \, \text{g}
  \]

### Final Answer:
The mass of \( \text{V}_2\text{O}_5 \) that can be obtained is **2.18 g**.
