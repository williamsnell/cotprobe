Question:

A well-known Washington newspaper columnist was researching the background of a lawyer who had been nominated to become attorney general of the United States and was awaiting confirmation by the U. S. Senate. One of the columnist's eager young apprentices concocted a plan that he hoped would enable him to gain the columnist's favor. Late one evening, without telling anyone, the apprentice broke into the lawyer's private office and copied several letters pertaining to "dirty tricks" perpetrated by the lawyer during the most recent presidential campaign. When the apprentice presented the columnist with the fruits of his diligent research, the columnist was quite impressed and immediately printed excerpts from the material. If the lawyer asserts a claim against the columnist for invasion of right to privacy, the plaintiff will most likely

Options:

A: prevail, because the information was obtained illegally.
B: prevail, because the publication was not newsworthy.
C: prevail, because the apprentice's action was an unlawful invasion of private facts.
D: prevail, because the apprentice acted on behalf of the columnist, making him liable.
E: not prevail, because the apprentice acted independently and without the knowledge or direction of the columnist.
F: not prevail, because the columnist was not involved in the burglary and did not conspire with the apprentice with respect to the burglary.
G: not prevail, because the information was of public interest and its publication served a greater public good.
H: not prevail, because the lawyer was a public figure and therefore his actions are subject to public scrutiny.
I: prevail, because the publication of private letters is an infringement on personal rights.
J: not prevail, because what the columnist printed was true, thus establishing there was no "false light. "

Okay, so I've got this question about invasion of privacy, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the scenario: A columnist is researching a lawyer nominated for attorney general. His apprentice breaks into the lawyer's office, copies some letters about "dirty tricks" from the last presidential campaign, and gives the info to the columnist, who then publishes excerpts. The lawyer is suing for invasion of privacy. The question is whether the plaintiff (the lawyer) will likely prevail.

I remember that invasion of privacy can involve a few different torts. The main ones are intrusion upon seclusion, public disclosure of private facts, false light, andappropriation. So I need to see which applies here.

The apprentice broke into the office—so that's an illegal intrusion. He copied letters, which are private. But the key here is whether the columnist is liable. The columnist didn't do the breaking and entering; the apprentice did it on his own. 

In terms of liability, if the columnist knew or had reason to know that the information was obtained illegally, they might be liable. But the question says the apprentice acted without telling anyone and on his own initiative. So the columnist wasn't involved in the burglary or the conspiracy. That makes a difference because if the columnist didn't know and wasn't part of it, they might not be liable for the invasion caused by the apprentice's actions.

But wait, what about the content? The letters are about "dirty tricks" during a presidential campaign. That sounds newsworthy, especially if the lawyer is a public figure. Public figures have a higher standard—newsworthiness is a defense. So even if the info was obtained illegally, if it's newsworthy and the subject is a public figure, the publication might be protected.

Looking at the options:

A: Prevail because info was obtained illegally. But if the info is newsworthy, even if obtained illegally, the publication might still be protected. So A might not be the right reason.

B: Prevail because not newsworthy. But "dirty tricks" in a campaign are likely newsworthy, especially for a lawyer in a high position.

C: Prevail because it's an unlawful invasion. But the unlawful part was the apprentice's act, not the columnist's. If the columnist didn't know, maybe not liable.

D: Prevail because the apprentice acted on behalf of the columnist. If the apprentice was acting as an agent for the columnist, then the columnist could be liable. But the question says the apprentice acted on his own without telling anyone, so maybe he wasn't acting on behalf.

E: Not prevail because the apprentice acted independently. This seems possible. If the columnist didn't know and wasn't involved, he's not liable.

F: Not prevail because the columnist wasn't involved in the burglary. This is similar to E, but F focuses on not conspiring, while E is about acting independently. Both could be factors.

G: Not prevail because it's of public interest. This is a strong defense. If the info serves the public good, it's a valid defense even if obtained illegally.

H: Not prevail because the lawyer is a public figure. This is also a point. Public figures have to prove actual malice, which might be harder. But the issue here is invasion of privacy, not defamation, so maybe H isn't the main reason.

I: Prevail because publishing private letters is an infringement. But again, if it's newsworthy, this might not hold.

J: Not prevail because it's true, so no false light. But the issue isn't about falsity; it's about privacy. So J might not be the right answer.

So the main issues are: Was the columnist involved in the illegal act? And is the information newsworthy?

The question states the apprentice acted independently, so the columnist didn't know and wasn't part of it. However, the information is about a lawyer nominated for attorney general, which is a public position, so it's likely newsworthy. Therefore, even if the info was obtained illegally, the publication might be protected under the public interest exception.

But wait, in some jurisdictions, the fact that the information was obtained illegally can still make the publication actionable. Because the means matter. So if the columnist knew or should have known the info was obtained illegally, they could be liable. But the question says the apprentice acted without telling anyone, so the columnist didn't know.

So the issue is whether the columnist's publication is privileged because it's newsworthy. If it's a matter of public concern, the publication is protected even if the source was illegal.

Looking at the options, G and H are possibilities. H says the lawyer is a public figure, so his actions are subject to scrutiny. But the invasion of privacy is about the means and the publication, not necessarily about being a public figure in the sense of defamation.

So the better answer would be G: not prevail because the info was of public interest and publication served a greater public good. Alternatively, E and F say the apprentice acted independently, so the columnist isn't liable.

Wait, but the question is whether the plaintiff (lawyer) will prevail. The key here is whether the columnist is liable for the invasion. If the columnist didn't know about the illegal act and wasn't involved, then he's not liable for the invasion. But the fact that the info was newsworthy might also be a defense, even if the columnist didn't know about the illegality.

So two possible answers: E and G. Which one is more applicable?

Invasion of privacy can be based on the act of the third party if the defendant (columnist) was involved. If not, then the defendant isn't liable. So E says the plaintiff won't prevail because the apprentice acted independently. That would mean the columnist isn't liable. On the other hand, G says it's not because it's of public interest.

But the main issue is whether the columnist is liable for the invasion. The fact that the info is newsworthy might be a defense to the invasion claim, but the initial invasion is the apprentice's act. So if the columnist didn't know, he's not liable for the invasion, even if the info is newsworthy.

So the correct answer would be E: not prevail because the apprentice acted independently and without the knowledge or direction of the columnist.

Wait, but some sources say that if a publication uses information knowing it was obtained illegally, they can be liable. But here, the columnist didn't know. So E seems correct.

Alternatively, if the info is newsworthy, G could be the reason, but the question is about the invasion claim, not the truth of the info.

Hmm, I'm a bit torn. But I think the key is the columnist's knowledge. Since he didn't know, he's not liable for the invasion. So E is the answer.
</think>

The question revolves around whether the lawyer will prevail in an invasion of privacy claim against the columnist. The key points are the columnist's lack of involvement in the illegal act and the newsworthiness of the information. The apprentice acted independently without the columnist's knowledge or direction, absolving the columnist of liability for the invasion. Additionally, the information pertains to a public figure and a matter of public interest, further supporting the columnist's defense. However, the primary reason the plaintiff will not prevail is the columnist's lack of involvement in the illegal act.

Answer: E
