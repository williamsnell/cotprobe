Question:

E.F. Schumacher, famous economist, in an article in the Atlantic (April 1979): Fifteen months [after I had advised that rural India should have a technology intermediate between the hoe and the tractor,] an all-India conference on intermediate technology was arranged. (They still didn't like the term [intermediate], so they called it appropriate technology. That's all right: when I come to India and somebody says, "Oh, Mr. Schumacher, I don't believe in appropriate technology", I just look him straight in the face and say, "Oh, that's splendid. Do you believe in inappropriate technology?")

Options:

A: Equivocation
B: Inconsistency
C: Appeal to Authority
D: Prejudicial Language

Okay, so I've got this question about E.F. Schumacher and a quote from his article. The question is asking about the logical fallacy used in this quote. The options are A through D: Equivocation, Inconsistency, Appeal to Authority, and Prejudicial Language.

Alright, let's break this down. The quote says that after Schumacher advised using technology between the hoe and tractor, an all-India conference was held on intermediate technology. But they didn't like the term "intermediate," so they called it "appropriate technology." Schumacher then mentions that if someone says they don't believe in appropriate technology, he responds by asking if they believe in "inappropriate technology" instead.

Hmm, so what's the fallacy here? Let's think about each option.

Equivocation is when a term is used in two different senses. But in this case, Schumacher is using "appropriate" and "inappropriate" as opposites, not playing on different meanings. So maybe not equivocation.

Inconsistency would be if he was contradicting himself, but he's just explaining their renaming. So probably not inconsistency.

Appeal to Authority is about using authority to back an argument, but here he's not citing his own authority; he's more making a point through wordplay.

Prejudicial Language is using loaded terms to bias the audience. He's using "inappropriate" as a direct opposite of "appropriate," which might be a bit of a rhetorical trick. When someone objects to "appropriate," he flips it by suggesting the alternative is "inappropriate," which carries a negative connotation. So this seems like a form of prejudice because it paints the alternative in a bad light without proper consideration.

Wait, but is it really prejudicial or more of a reductio ad absurdum? Or maybe it's a type of straw man by misrepresenting their position. But the options don't include straw man. So among the choices, Prejudicial Language seems to fit because he's using terms in a way that influences the audience's perception negatively without a fair assessment.

So I think the answer is D: Prejudicial Language.

The quote uses a rhetorical strategy where Schumacher responds to criticism of "appropriate technology" by suggesting the alternative is "inappropriate technology," which carries a negative connotation. This approach biases the audience against the alternative without fair consideration, fitting the definition of Prejudicial Language.
