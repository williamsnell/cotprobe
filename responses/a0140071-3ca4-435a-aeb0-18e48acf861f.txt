Okay, so I have this question here: What is the order of group Z_{18}? The options are A to J, with numbers ranging from 9 to 36. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on group theory, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that Z_n denotes the group of integers modulo n under addition. So Z_{18} would be the set {0, 1, 2, ..., 17} with the operation of addition modulo 18. Now, the order of a group is the number of elements in it. So I just need to count how many elements are in Z_{18}.

Wait, Z_{18} includes all integers from 0 up to 17, right? Because once you reach 18, you're back to 0 modulo 18. So that's 18 elements in total. Let me list them out to be sure: 0,1,2,3,...,17. Yep, that's 18 numbers.

I might be mixing up some concepts here. I remember that the order of an element is differentâ€”it's the smallest positive integer m such that m times the element is the identity. But the question is about the order of the group, not an element. So I shouldn't confuse the two.

Just to make sure, let me think about another example. The group Z_5 has elements {0,1,2,3,4}, so its order is 5. Similarly, Z_12 has 12 elements. So applying that logic, Z_{18} must have 18 elements, making its order 18.

Looking back at the options, G is 18. So that must be the correct answer. I don't think there's any trick here, it's straightforward once I recall that Z_n has order n.

The group Z_{18} consists of the integers modulo 18 under addition, which includes the elements {0, 1, 2, ..., 17}. Since there are 18 distinct elements, the order of the group is 18.

Answer: G
