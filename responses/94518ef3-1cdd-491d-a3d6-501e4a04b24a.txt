Okay, so I've got this problem about calculating the net price of a typewriter after applying a series of discounts. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The typewriter is priced at $80, and there are three discounts: 20%, 10%, and 5%. I need to find the net price after applying all these discounts. Hmm, wait, do I apply each discount one after the other, or do I add them up and apply them all at once? I'm a bit confused about that part. Let me think.

I remember that when discounts are applied successively, each discount is applied to the price after the previous discount has been subtracted. So, it's not just adding up all the percentages and taking that from the original price. Instead, each discount is applied in sequence. So, I should calculate each discount one after another.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Start with the original price: $80.
2. Apply the first discount of 20%.
3. Take the resulting price and apply the next discount of 10%.
4. Then, take that new price and apply the 5% discount.
5. The final amount after all three discounts is the net price.

Wait, but another way to think about it is that each discount is applied to the remaining amount after the previous discount. So, for example, the 20% discount reduces the price, then the 10% is on the reduced price, and so on.

Alternatively, some people might add up the discounts: 20% + 10% + 5% = 35%, and then take 35% off the original price. But I'm not sure if that's correct because each discount is applied to a successively lower price, so the total discount isn't just additive in that way.

Let me try both approaches to see which gives a correct result. 

First, applying each discount successively:

Original price = $80.

First discount: 20%. So, 20% of 80 is (20/100)*80 = 16. So, the price after the first discount is 80 - 16 = $64.

Second discount: 10%. Now, 10% of $64 is (10/100)*64 = $6.4. So, the price after the second discount is 64 - 6.4 = $57.6.

Third discount: 5%. 5% of $57.6 is (5/100)*57.6 = $2.88. Subtracting that, the final price is 57.6 - 2.88 = $54.72.

Wait, so that's one way. Alternatively, adding up the discounts: 20% + 10% +5% = 35%. So, 35% of 80 is (35/100)*80 = 28. So, the price would be 80 - 28 = $52. But wait, that's not matching the earlier result. So, clearly, applying them successively gives a different result than adding them up. So, which method is correct?

I think the correct method is applying each discount successively because each discount is applied after the previous one has been taken off. So, the first discount brings the price down, and each subsequent discount is applied to the new, lower price. Therefore, the correct way is to apply each discount in sequence, which gives $54.72 as the net price.

Looking at the options, E is $54.72. So, the answer should be E.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

First discount: 20% of 80 is 16. 80 -16 = 64. Correct.

Second discount: 10% of 64 is 6.4. 64 -6.4 = 57.6. Correct.

Third discount: 5% of 57.6 is 2.88. 57.6 -2.88 = 54.72. Yes, that's correct.

Alternatively, if I had applied all discounts at once, the calculation would be different. Let's see: 80 * (1 - 0.20) * (1 - 0.10) * (1 - 0.05). That would be 80 * 0.8 * 0.9 * 0.95.

Calculating that: 80 * 0.8 = 64. 64 * 0.9 = 57.6. 57.6 * 0.95 = 54.72. Yep, same result.

So, the net price is $54.72, which is option E.

The net price of the typewriter after applying successive discounts of 20%, 10%, and 5% is calculated by applying each discount one after the other. Starting with $80, each subsequent discount is applied to the reduced price from the previous step. This results in a final price of $54.72, which corresponds to option E.

Answer: E
