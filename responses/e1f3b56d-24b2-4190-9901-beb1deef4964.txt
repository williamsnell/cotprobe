Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the UK Constitution, and I need to figure out which statement is correct. Let me think through each option carefully.

First, I remember that the UK doesn't have a single written constitution like the US does. The US Constitution is all in one document, right? But the UK's constitution is different. I think it's what's called an uncodified constitution, meaning it's not all in one place. So looking at the options, option B says it's codified and in a single document, which I don't think is right. Option H says it's uncodified and found in various sources, which sounds more accurate. So maybe H is correct.

Option A says it's a direct copy of the US Constitution. That doesn't make sense because I know the UK's system is different, especially with the monarchy and the structure of Parliament. So A is probably wrong.

Option C states it can be changed by a simple majority in Parliament. Wait, isn't changing the constitution a bit more involved? I think amendments might require a special procedure, like a two-thirds majority or something. So C might not be correct.

Option D mentions the judiciary overturning Parliament. I recall that in the UK, the courts can't usually strike down laws passed by Parliament. That's a key difference from the US where the Supreme Court has that power. So D is likely incorrect.

Option E says it's based on a Bill of Rights. There's the UK Bill of Rights, but I think that's from 1689, and the constitution is more than that. Plus, the UK doesn't have a single constitutional document, so E might not be the best choice.

Option F claims the constitution's power is solely from Parliament. I'm not sure about 'solely.' The constitution also includes conventions and common law, so F might not be entirely accurate.

Option G says it's based entirely on EU law, but since the UK left the EU (Brexit), that's probably no longer the case. So G is incorrect now.

Option I says the constitution's power comes only from the sovereign. That doesn't sound right because the UK's government is a mix of monarchy, Parliament, and other elements. The sovereign's role is ceremonial, so I think I is wrong.

Option J states it's based solely on common law. But the UK constitution includes statutes, conventions, and EU law (before Brexit), so it's not just common law. So J is incorrect.

Putting it all together, the correct answer should be H: The UK Constitution is uncodified and can be found in a number of sources. That makes sense because the UK's constitution isn't written in one place but comes from various statutes, conventions, and legal documents.
