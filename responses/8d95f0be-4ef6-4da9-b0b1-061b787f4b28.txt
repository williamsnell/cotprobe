Question:

Ultra Co. uses a periodic inventory system. The following are inventory transactions for the month of January: 1/1 Beginning inventory 20000 units at $13 1/20 Purchase 30000 units at $15 1/23 Purchase 40000 units at $17 1/31 Sales at $20 per unit 50000 units Ultra uses the LIFO method to determine the value of its inventory. What amount should Ultra report as cost of goods sold on its income statement for the month of January?

Okay, so I need to figure out the cost of goods sold (COGS) for Ultra Co. using the LIFO method in January. Let's start by understanding what's given.

First, Ultra Co. uses a periodic inventory system and LIFO for inventory valuation. LIFO means that the last items purchased are the first ones sold, which is important for calculating COGS.

The transactions for January are:
- 1/1: Beginning inventory of 20,000 units at $13 each.
- 1/20: Purchase of 30,000 units at $15 each.
- 1/23: Purchase of 40,000 units at $17 each.
- 1/31: Sales of 50,000 units at $20 each.

The goal is to calculate COGS using LIFO. COGS is calculated as ( Beginning Inventory + Purchases ) - Ending Inventory. But since LIFO affects the cost of goods sold, we need to determine which costs are allocated to the goods sold.

Under LIFO, the most recent purchases are considered to be sold first. So, let's break down the inventory:

1. **Beginning Inventory**: 20,000 units at $13 = $260,000.
2. **First Purchase (1/20)**: 30,000 units at $15 = $450,000.
3. **Second Purchase (1/23)**: 40,000 units at $17 = $680,000.

Total units available for sale = 20k + 30k + 40k = 90,000 units.

Sales made: 50,000 units. So, COGS will be the cost of the 50,000 units sold, which, under LIFO, are the most recent purchases first.

Let's see the order of costs:

- The last purchase was 40,000 units at $17 each. So, 40k units are sold from here first.
- Then, the next available is the 30,000 units at $15 each.

So, COGS calculation:

- 40,000 units at $17: 40,000 * 17 = $680,000.
- Then, we need 10,000 more units to reach 50,000 sold. These come from the 30,000 units at $15.

10,000 units * $15 = $150,000.

Total COGS = $680,000 + $150,000 = $830,000.

Wait, but let me double-check. The purchases are 30k and 40k. So, the 40k is the last in, so those are the first to be sold. Then, the remaining 10k come from the 30k lot.

Yes, that adds up correctly. So COGS is $830,000.

Looking at the options, option D is $830,000. So the answer should be D.

The cost of goods sold (COGS) is calculated using the LIFO method, which allocates the most recent purchases to the goods sold first. Ultra Co. sold 50,000 units. The 40,000 units from the last purchase at $17 each are sold first, contributing $680,000. The remaining 10,000 units come from the earlier purchase at $15 each, adding $150,000. Total COGS is $830,000.

Answer: D
