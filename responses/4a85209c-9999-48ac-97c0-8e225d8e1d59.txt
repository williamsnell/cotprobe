Question:

This question refers to the following information.
"In one view the slaveholders have a decided advantage over all opposition. It is well to notice this advantage—the advantage of complete organization. They are organized; and yet were not at the pains of creating their organizations. The State governments, where the system of slavery exists, are complete slavery organizations. The church organizations in those States are equally at the service of slavery; while the Federal Government, with its army and navy, from the chief magistracy in Washington, to the Supreme Court, and thence to the chief marshalship at New York, is pledged to support, defend, and propagate the crying curse of human bondage. The pen, the purse, and the sword, are united against the simple truth, preached by humble men in obscure places."
Frederick Douglass, 1857
In his opinion on the case Dred Scott v. Sandford, Chief Justice Roger Taney upheld the sentiment above by stating that

Options:

A: corporations were entitled to the same protections guaranteed to individuals under the Fourteenth Amendment
B: the Fugitive Slave Act was unconstitutional
C: women had the right to vote under the United States Constitution
D: separate but equal facilities for people of different races was constitutional
E: every state had the right to secede from the Union
F: the abolitionist movement was a threat to the United States Constitution
G: school prayer violated the principle of "separation of church and state"
H: the Second Amendment allowed individuals to keep and bear arms
I: slavery was a state's rights issue and should be decided by popular sovereignty
J: Congress had no right to regulate slavery in United States territories

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about Frederick Douglass and the Dred Scott v. Sandford case. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the question is asking which statement by Chief Justice Roger Taney in his opinion on Dred Scott aligns with the sentiment Douglass expressed. The passage from Douglass talks about how slaveholders had a significant advantage because the entire structure of the government—state, church, and federal—was organized to support slavery. He mentions the pen, purse, and sword being united against abolition.

I remember that the Dred Scott decision was a major case in U.S. history. Dred Scott was a slave who sued for his freedom after living in free territory. The Supreme Court ruled against him, and Taney's opinion was very significant. From what I recall, Taney's argument was that African Americans were not citizens and had no rights, including the right to sue. He also stated that the Missouri Compromise was unconstitutional because Congress couldn't ban slavery in territories.

Looking at the options, let's go through them one by one.

Option A: This is about corporations and the Fourteenth Amendment. I don't think that's related here because the Fourteenth Amendment wasn't even passed yet; the Dred Scott decision was in 1857, and the Fourteenth Amendment came after the Civil War.

Option B: The Fugitive Slave Act being unconstitutional. I think the Fugitive Slave Act was part of the Compromise of 1850, but Taney's opinion in Dred Scott was more about the citizenship of African Americans and the constitutionality of the Missouri Compromise, not directly about the Fugitive Slave Act.

Option C: Women's right to vote. That's a women's suffrage issue, which wasn't addressed in Dred Scott. So probably not this one.

Option D: Separate but equal facilities. That's from Plessy v. Ferguson, which was much later, in 1896. So not relevant here.

Option E: States' right to secede. While states' rights were a factor, the Dred Scott decision was more about the rights of African Americans and federal authority over territories, not directly about secession.

Option F: Abolitionist movement as a threat. Taney did argue against the abolitionists, saying they were trying to undermine the Constitution by attacking slavery. He believed that the Founding Fathers didn't consider blacks as citizens. So this might be a contender.

Option G: School prayer and separation of church and state. That's from another case, probably not related to Dred Scott.

Option H: Second Amendment right to bear arms. Not directly related to the Dred Scott case.

Option I: Slavery as a state's rights issue. Taney actually argued against popular sovereignty and the idea that territories could decide on slavery. He believed that the federal government couldn't restrict slavery in territories, which aligns with the idea that states' rights allowed slavery where it was permitted.

Option J: Congress couldn't regulate slavery in territories. Yes, this is directly from the Dred Scott decision. Taney's opinion stated that Congress had no power to prohibit slavery in the territories, which invalidated the Missouri Compromise.

Wait, so in the passage, Douglass is talking about how the entire government structure supports slavery. Taney's opinion in Dred Scott would have supported that by saying that the federal government couldn't interfere with slavery in territories, thus allowing it to spread, and that African Americans had no rights. So which option aligns with that?

Option J says Congress had no right to regulate slavery in territories, which is exactly what Taney ruled. Option I says slavery was a state's rights issue, which is somewhat related but not exactly the same as Taney's specific ruling that Congress couldn't prohibit it in territories.

So the answer should be J because Taney specifically addressed Congress's lack of authority to regulate slavery in territories, supporting Douglass's view that the government was organized to protect slavery.
