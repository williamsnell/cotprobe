Okay, so I have this question about how IP datagrams travel through routers, and I need to figure out the number of interfaces and forwarding tables used. Let me think through this step by step.

The question says there are three routers between a source host and a destination host. We’re ignoring fragmentation, so I don’t have to worry about that complicating things. I need to find out two things: the number of interfaces the datagram travels over and the number of forwarding tables that are indexed.

First, let me visualize the setup. The source host is on one side, and the destination is on the other. There are three routers in between. So, the path would be: Source Host → Router 1 → Router 2 → Router 3 → Destination Host.

Wait, but each router has interfaces. So, how many interfaces does each router use here? Each time the datagram moves from one router to the next, it goes through an interface. Also, when it leaves the source host and enters the first router, that's another interface. Similarly, when it exits the last router to reach the destination, that's another interface.

Let me count the interfaces. The source sends to Router 1: that's one interface on Router 1. Then, Router 1 forwards to Router 2: another interface on Router 1 (wait, no, wait. Each router has incoming and outgoing interfaces. So, Router 1 receives from the source on its input interface and sends to Router 2 on its output interface. So each router uses two interfaces per hop? No, that's not right. Each hop uses one interface per router, but each router handles one hop.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the number of hops. The datagram goes through three routers, so that's three hops. Each hop involves one interface on the outgoing router. So from source to Router 1: that's one interface on Router 1. Then Router 1 to Router 2: another interface on Router 2. Router 2 to Router 3: another interface on Router 3. Then Router 3 to destination: that's the destination's interface.

Wait, but I'm counting the number of interfaces the datagram passes through. Each time it goes into a router, it uses an input interface, and then an output interface. But when considering the entire journey, how many interfaces does it cross?

Wait, maybe I should think of each router as having an input and an output interface. So for each router, the datagram enters through one interface and exits through another. So for three routers, that's 3 input and 3 output interfaces. Plus the source's interface and the destination's interface.

Wait, no, the source host sends to the first router's input interface. Then the first router sends to the second router's input interface. The second router sends to the third router's input interface. The third router sends to the destination host's interface. So that's four interfaces in total: source sends to Router 1 (1), Router 1 sends to Router 2 (2), Router 2 sends to Router 3 (3), Router 3 sends to destination (4). So that's four interfaces. But that can't be right because each router has two interfaces involved per hop.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. Each time the datagram moves from one router to the next, it uses the next router's input interface. So from source to Router 1: that's one interface (Router 1's input). Then Router 1 sends to Router 2: Router 2's input. Router 2 sends to Router 3: Router 3's input. Then Router 3 sends to destination: that's the destination's interface. So in terms of interfaces the datagram passes through, it's Router 1's input, Router 2's input, Router 3's input, and the destination. So that's four interfaces. But that doesn't seem right because each router has two interfaces: one for incoming and one for outgoing. Wait, but for each hop, the outgoing interface of one router is the incoming interface of the next. So perhaps each router contributes two interfaces per hop? No, that's not correct because each hop only uses one interface on each router.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to count the number of times the datagram leaves an interface. So, the source sends to Router 1's input interface (1). Router 1 then sends to Router 2's input interface (2). Router 2 sends to Router 3's input interface (3). Router 3 sends to the destination (4). So the datagram passes through four interfaces in total. But that doesn't match any of the options given, because looking at the options, the first number is between 4 and 12. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe each router has two interfaces: one for each connection. So when the datagram goes through Router 1, it comes in on one interface and goes out on another. So that's two interfaces. Similarly for Router 2 and 3. Then the source and destination each have one interface. So total interfaces would be 2 (source and destination) plus 2 interfaces per router times 3 routers, which is 6. So 2 + 6 = 8 interfaces. That would make the first number 8.

Wait, that makes sense because each router has two interfaces: one for the incoming datagram and one for the outgoing. So Router 1: in and out (2), Router 2: in and out (2), Router 3: in and out (2). Plus the source's one interface and the destination's one interface. So total is 2 (source and destination) + 3 routers * 2 interfaces each = 8 interfaces. So the first part is 8.

Now, the second part: how many forwarding tables are indexed? Each router maintains a forwarding table, which is used to determine where to send the datagram. So each time the datagram passes through a router, the forwarding table of that router is indexed. Since there are three routers, that's three forwarding tables. But wait, the source host doesn't have a forwarding table; it's just the routers. So the number of forwarding tables indexed is 3, one for each router the datagram passes through.

Wait, but looking at the options, option F is [8,3], which would fit. But let me check other options. Option E is [7,4], which doesn't match. Option C is [8,4], which would mean four forwarding tables. But why would it be four? Maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the source and destination also have some tables, but I think the question is only about the routers. The source and destination are hosts, not routers, so their forwarding tables (if any) aren't considered here. So it's three routers, each using their own forwarding table once. So three tables.

Wait, but let me think again. The datagram starts at the source, which is on one side of Router 1. When the source sends the datagram to Router 1, Router 1 uses its forwarding table to decide where to send it. Then Router 2 does the same, and Router 3 does the same. So three forwarding tables are used.

So the answer would be [8,3], which is option F.

But wait, let me double-check. The number of interfaces is 8 because each router uses two interfaces (in and out), except the first and last. Wait, no: the first router has an incoming interface from the source and an outgoing interface to the next router. Similarly, the last router has an incoming from the previous router and an outgoing to the destination. So each of the three routers uses two interfaces, and the source and destination each use one. So 3*2 + 2 = 8. That's correct.

So the first number is 8, the second is 3, so option F: [8,3].
</think>

The datagram travels through three routers, each using two interfaces (incoming and outgoing), plus one interface for the source and one for the destination, totaling 8 interfaces. Each router's forwarding table is indexed once, resulting in 3 tables.

Answer: F
