Options:

A: The contract would be unenforceable, because it was not written and signed by both parties.
B: The performance of the roofer would be a constructive condition precedent to the performance by the homeowner.
C: The performance by the homeowner would be an implied condition subsequent to the performance by the roofer.
D: The performance by the homeowner would be a constructive condition precedent to the performance by the roofer.
E: The performances of the homeowner and the roofer would be constructive concurrent conditions.
F: The contract would be unenforceable, because it was oral.
G: The performance of the roofer would be an implied condition subsequent to the performance by the homeowner.
H: The performances of the homeowner and the roofer would be independent conditions.
I: The performances of the homeowner and the roofer would be express concurrent conditions.

Okay, so I've got this question about contract law, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The scenario is that after a severe thunderstorm, a homeowner's roof is damaged. She calls a roofer, who agrees to repair the roof within 30 days, and the homeowner promises to pay $10,000. The question is about which statement is most accurate regarding their contract.

First, I need to recall some basic contract law principles. Contracts can be enforceable even if they're oral unless they fall under specific exceptions. The Statute of Frauds requires certain contracts to be in writing, but for services like this, unless the amount is over a certain threshold or it's a real estate contract, it might not apply. So, I'm thinking whether the contract being oral affects its enforceability.

Looking at the options, options A and F both talk about the contract being unenforceable because it's not written. A says it's unenforceable because not written and signed, while F says it's unenforceable because it's oral. Well, contracts can be oral and still enforceable unless they meet the Statute of Frauds requirements. Since this is a service contract for $10k, I don't think it's covered under the Statute of Frauds (which typically applies to goods over $500, real estate, etc.). So, options A and F might not be correct because the oral nature doesn't necessarily make it unenforceable.

Next, the question is about the conditions for performance. The options are talking about conditions like constructive, implied, or concurrent conditions. Let me think about what each term means.

A condition precedent is something that must happen before the other party's duty is triggered. For example, if the roofer has to do the work before the homeowner pays, that's a condition precedent.

An implied condition subsequent would mean that if one party doesn't perform, the other can do something else, like terminate the contract. But in this case, both parties are agreeing to their respective performances without any mention of conditions beyond the timeline.

Constructive conditions are those that are implied by law, even if they're not stated. So, if the roofer must perform the repair in a workmanlike manner, that's a constructive condition. But how does that relate to the homeowner's payment?

The option E says the performances are constructive concurrent conditions. That would mean both parties are performing at the same time, each depending on the other. But in reality, the roofer starts working, and upon completion, the homeowner pays. So they might not be concurrent but sequential.

Option H says the performances are independent conditions. That would mean each party doesn't depend on the other's performance. But in a contract, usually, each party's obligation is dependent on the other's. For example, the roofer will repair only if the homeowner pays, but here the payment is after the work. Wait, no, the payment is promised after the work is done. So the roofer must perform first, then the homeowner pays. So it's a condition precedentâ€”roofer must finish the work before the homeowner's obligation to pay arises.

Looking at the options, which one aligns with this? Let's see. The roofer's performance is a condition that must be met before the homeowner pays. So the roofer's performance is a condition precedent to the homeowner's payment.

Now, let's look at the options again. Option B says the roofer's performance is a constructive condition precedent to the homeowner's performance. That sounds correct because the roofer must finish the work (constructive because it's a duty to perform in a certain way) before the homeowner has to pay.

Option D says the homeowner's performance is a constructive condition precedent to the roofer's performance. That doesn't make sense because the roofer is supposed to finish first, then the homeowner pays.

Option E talks about concurrent conditions, which isn't the case here. The performances are sequential, not concurrent.

Option H says independent conditions. But they're not independent; the homeowner's payment depends on the roofer completing the work.

So, putting it together, the correct answer should be B: The performance of the roofer would be a constructive condition precedent to the performance by the homeowner.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check. Constructive conditions are those that the law implies, such as the duty to perform in a workmanlike manner. So, the roofer's duty to repair properly is a constructive condition. But in terms of sequencing, the roofer must perform the repair (a condition) before the homeowner pays. So the roofer's performance is a condition precedent to the homeowner's payment. So the correct option is B.
