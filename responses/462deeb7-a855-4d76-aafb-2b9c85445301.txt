Answer the following multiple choice question, selecting from the answer A through to J. After thinking, reply directly with your answer. 

The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

Define language. List and define its elements.

Options:

A: Language is the visual representation of ideas through art. The elements include: lines, shapes, colors, and textures.
B: Language is the genetic transmission of information from parent to offspring. The elements include: genes, chromosomes, DNA, and mutations.
C: Language is the written form of communication using an alphabet. The elements include: letters, words, punctuation, and grammar.
D: Language is the complex arrangement of sounds that have accepted referents and can be arranged to derive meanings. The units of language include: phonemes, morphemes, syntax, and prosody.
E: Language is a tool for communication
F: Language is the process of transferring thoughts through telepathy. The elements include: sender, receiver, thought waves, and mental clarity.
G: Language is the combination of words to form sentences
H: Language is a system of gestures used exclusively by primates. The elements include: signals, movements, expressions, and gestures.
I: Language is the use of signs and symbols
J: Language is the method of communication using mathematical symbols and numbers. The elements include: numerals, equations, operations, and proofs.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about defining language and its elements, and I need to choose the correct option from A to J. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I'll read the question again carefully. It asks to define language and list its elements, then select the correct option. The options are A through J, each with a different definition and elements.

I know that language is more than just spoken words; it's a system used for communication. So I need to think about what each option is saying and see which one aligns with the standard definition.

Option A says language is the visual representation through art, with elements like lines, shapes, colors, and textures. That sounds more like art or visual communication, not language. Language isn't just visual; it's verbal and can be written too.

Option B talks about genetic transmission, which is about DNA and genes. That seems to be about biology, not communication. So probably not B.

Option C defines language as the written form using an alphabet, with elements like letters, words, punctuation, and grammar. While writing is part of language, language isn't just writing. It also includes spoken forms. So C might be too narrow.

Option D says language is a complex arrangement of sounds with accepted referents, and the units are phonemes, morphemes, syntax, and prosody. That sounds familiar. Phonemes are the sounds, morphemes are the smallest meaningful units, syntax is the structure of sentences, and prosody relates to rhythm and stress. This seems correct because it covers both spoken aspects and the structure of language.

Option E simply states that language is a tool for communication. While true, it doesn't list the elements, so maybe it's incomplete.

Option F mentions telepathy, which is mental transmission of thoughts. That's not how language works, so F is probably incorrect.

Option G says language is the combination of words into sentences. That's part of syntax, but it doesn't cover all aspects of language, like sounds or meaning.

Option H refers to gestures used by primates, which is sign language, but that's a specific form and not the general definition of language.

Option I talks about signs and symbols, which is more about semiotics. Language does use symbols, but it's broader than that.

Option J is about mathematical symbols and numbers, which is a specific system, not general language.

So, putting it all together, the best fit is option D. It correctly defines language as a system of sounds with meanings and lists the key elements. The other options either focus on a narrow aspect or are unrelated to the broader definition of language.

The correct answer is D. Language is defined as a complex arrangement of sounds with accepted referents, and its elements include phonemes, morphemes, syntax, and prosody.

Answer: D
