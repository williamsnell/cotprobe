Okay, so I've got this question here about calculating the net cost of a tape recorder. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the list price is $32, and there's a discount rate of 30%. I think I need to find out what the discounted price is after applying that 30% off.

Alright, first, I remember that a discount is calculated by taking the percentage off the original price. So, the discount amount would be 30% of $32. Let me write that down. 30% as a decimal is 0.3, right? So, I multiply $32 by 0.3 to find the discount.

Calculating that, 32 times 0.3 equals... let's see, 32 times 0.3 is 9.6. So the discount is $9.60. Now, to find the net cost, I subtract that discount from the original list price. That would be $32 minus $9.60.

Wait, 32 minus 9.60. Let me do that subtraction. 32 minus 9 is 23, and then minus another 0.60 would be 22.40. So the net cost should be $22.40. Let me check the options again to see which one that is.

Looking at the options, F is $22.40. So that must be the correct answer. I don't think I made any mistakes here. The steps seem right: calculate the discount, subtract it from the original price. Yep, F looks good.

The net cost is calculated by subtracting the 30% discount from the list price. 30% of $32 is $9.60, so the net cost is $32 - $9.60 = $22.40.

Answer: F
