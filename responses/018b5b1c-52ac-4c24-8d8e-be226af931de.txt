Question:

Find the ∆H°, heat of reaction, for the hydrolysis of urea to CO_2 and NH_3. Although the reaction does not pro-ceed at a detectable rate in the absence of the enzyme, urease, ∆H may still be computed from the following thermodynamic data: Component ∆H°_f (Kcal/mole Urea (aq) - 76.30 CO_2 (aq) - 98.69 H_2O (l) - 68.32 NH_3 (aq) - 19.32 The hydrolysis reaction is H_2O (l) + H_2N - CO - NH_2 \rightarrow CO_2(aq) + 2NH_3 (aq) (urea)

Options:

A: -2.71 Kcal/mole
B: 7.29 Kcal/mole
C: 5.29 Kcal/mole
D: 11.29 Kcal/mole
E: 10.29 Kcal/mole
F: 3.29 Kcal/mole
G: 6.29 Kcal/mole
H: 9.29 Kcal/mole
I: -4.71 Kcal/mole
J: 8.29 Kcal/mole

Okay, so I've got this question about finding the standard enthalpy change (ΔH°) for the hydrolysis of urea. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on thermodynamics, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that the standard enthalpy change of a reaction can be calculated using the formula: ΔH°_rxn = Σ ΔH°_f(products) - Σ ΔH°_f(reactants). Right, because it's the enthalpy of formation of the products minus that of the reactants.

The reaction given is: H₂O(l) + H₂N–CO–NH₂(aq) → CO₂(aq) + 2NH₃(aq). So, urea reacting with water to produce carbon dioxide and ammonia.

Wait, the problem lists the components and their ΔH°_f values. Let me jot them down:

- Urea (aq): -76.30 kcal/mol
- CO₂(aq): -98.69 kcal/mol
- H₂O(l): -68.32 kcal/mol
- NH₃(aq): -19.32 kcal/mol

Wait, but in the reaction, urea is the reactant on the left. The products are CO₂ and NH₃.

So, for the products, CO₂ and 2 NH₃. Their ΔH°_f's would be summed up. For the reactants, it's urea and water.

Let me write down the formula:

ΔH°_rxn = [ΔH°_f(CO₂) + 2*ΔH°_f(NH₃)] - [ΔH°_f(urea) + ΔH°_f(H₂O)]

Plugging in the numbers:

ΔH°_rxn = [(-98.69) + 2*(-19.32)] - [(-76.30) + (-68.32)]

Calculating step by step.

First, the products part: CO₂ is -98.69. NH₃ is -19.32, multiplied by 2, so 2*(-19.32) = -38.64. Adding those together: -98.69 + (-38.64) = -137.33.

Now the reactants: Urea is -76.30, H₂O is -68.32. So sum is (-76.30) + (-68.32) = -144.62.

So putting it into the formula: (-137.33) - (-144.62) = -137.33 + 144.62 = 7.29.

Wait, so the ΔH°_rxn is 7.29 kcal/mol. Looking at the options, option B is 7.29. So the answer should be B.

But wait, let me double-check the signs. Because sometimes I get confused about whether it's products minus reactants. So, products' total is -137.33, reactants' total is -144.62. So subtracting reactants from products: (-137.33) - (-144.62) = 7.29. Yeah, that's correct.

Wait, does the reaction being exothermic or endothermic make sense? If ΔH is positive, it's endothermic. Urea hydrolysis, I think, requires heat or an enzyme, but the enthalpy change here is positive, so it's endothermic. That makes sense because the reaction might need energy to proceed, even with the enzyme. So the calculation seems right.

The standard enthalpy change (ΔH°) for the hydrolysis reaction is calculated using the formula:  
ΔH°_rxn = Σ ΔH°_f(products) - Σ ΔH°_f(reactants).  

The reaction is:  
H₂O(l) + H₂N–CO–NH₂(aq) → CO₂(aq) + 2NH₃(aq).  

Using the given ΔH°_f values:  
- CO₂(aq): -98.69 kcal/mol  
- NH₃(aq): -19.32 kcal/mol  
- Urea (aq): -76.30 kcal/mol  
- H₂O(l): -68.32 kcal/mol  

For the products:  
ΔH°_f(products) = (-98.69) + 2*(-19.32) = -98.69 - 38.64 = -137.33 kcal/mol  

For the reactants:  
ΔH°_f(reactants) = (-76.30) + (-68.32) = -144.62 kcal/mol  

ΔH°_rxn = (-137.33) - (-144.62) = -137.33 + 144.62 = 7.29 kcal/mol  

Thus, the correct answer is **B: 7.29 Kcal/mole**.  

Answer: B
