Okay, so I need to calculate the standard deviation of the sample data: 5, 8, 2, 1. Hmm, I remember that standard deviation is a measure of how spread out the numbers are. But wait, there are different formulas for population and sample standard deviation. Since the question says it's a sample, I think I should use the sample standard deviation formula, which divides by (n-1) instead of n. 

First, I'll find the mean of the data. The mean is the average, so I'll add all the numbers together and divide by how many there are. Let's see: 5 + 8 is 13, plus 2 makes 15, and then plus 1 is 16. There are 4 numbers, so the mean is 16 divided by 4, which is 4.

Next, I need to find the squared differences from the mean for each number. 

Starting with 5: 5 minus 4 is 1, and 1 squared is 1.
Then 8: 8 minus 4 is 4, squared is 16.
Then 2: 2 minus 4 is -2, squared is 4.
And finally 1: 1 minus 4 is -3, squared is 9.

Now I'll add up all these squared differences: 1 + 16 is 17, plus 4 is 21, plus 9 makes 30. 

Since this is a sample, I'll divide by (n-1), which is 3. So 30 divided by 3 is 10. Now, the variance is 10. But wait, the standard deviation is the square root of the variance. So I'll take the square root of 10. Let me calculate that—sqrt(10) is approximately 3.1623. 

Looking at the options, I see E is 3.92, which is higher. Hmm, did I make a mistake? Wait, maybe I should double-check the calculations. Let me go through each step again.

Mean: (5+8+2+1)/4 = 16/4 = 4. That's correct.

Squared differences:
5: (5-4)^2 = 1
8: (8-4)^2 = 16
2: (2-4)^2 = 4
1: (1-4)^2 = 9
Sum: 1+16=17, +4=21, +9=30. Correct.

Variance for sample: 30/(4-1)=10. So standard deviation is sqrt(10)≈3.16. But none of the options exactly match 3.16. Wait, maybe the question is asking for population standard deviation instead? Let me check that.

If it's population variance, then divide by n=4. 30/4=7.5. Square root of 7.5 is about 2.7386. Looking at the options, A is 2.74. So that would be the answer if it's population. But the question says 'sample', so I'm confused.

Wait, maybe I misread the question. Let me read it again: "compute the standard deviation of the sample." So sample standard deviation, which uses n-1. So 3.16 is the correct value, but that's not among the options. The closest option is E: 3.92, but that's higher. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations.

Wait, another thought: Did I add the squared differences correctly? Let's re-add them: 1 (from 5) +16 (from 8) is 17, plus 4 (from 2) is 21, plus 9 (from 1) is 30. That's correct. So sample variance is 10, standard deviation sqrt(10)=3.16. Since it's not an option, maybe I should consider if the data includes all numbers or if I misread the sample. Wait, the data is 5,8,2,1. That's four numbers, correct.

Wait, could the question have a typo? Or perhaps I'm using the wrong formula. Let me think again. Oh wait! Maybe the data is considered as a population, not a sample. If that's the case, then variance is 30/4=7.5, and standard deviation sqrt(7.5)=approx 2.7386, which rounds to 2.74. So option A. But the question says 'sample', so I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the squared differences. Let me check each one again:

5: 5-4=1, 1^2=1. Correct.
8:8-4=4, 4^2=16. Correct.
2:2-4=-2, (-2)^2=4. Correct.
1:1-4=-3, (-3)^2=9. Correct.

Sum is 30. So yes, variance is 10 or 7.5 depending on population or sample. Since the question specifies 'sample', the answer should be sqrt(10)=3.16, but that's not an option. Wait, perhaps the sample size is considered as n=5? No, the data has four numbers. So maybe the options are incorrect, or perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe I should compute it using another method. Let me try calculating the variance again. Sum of squares: (5^2 +8^2 +2^2 +1^2) =25 +64 +4 +1=94. Then, the mean is 4, so sum of squares minus n*(mean squared) is 94 -4*(16)=94-64=30. So sample variance is 30/3=10. So standard deviation is sqrt(10)=3.16, which isn't an option. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the standard deviation was calculated as population, which would give sqrt(7.5)=2.738, which is 2.74, option A. So maybe the question intended population, or perhaps there's a mistake in the options. Since option A is 2.74, which is close to 2.738, I think that's the intended answer.

The standard deviation of the sample data 5, 8, 2, 1 is approximately 2.74 when calculated using the population standard deviation formula.
