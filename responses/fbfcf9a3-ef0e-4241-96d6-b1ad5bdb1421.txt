B: Have no impact on the equilibrium quantity but increase the price.
C: Have no impact on the equilibrium price but increase the quantity.
D: decrease the equilibrium quantity and increase the price.
E: increase the equilibrium price but the change in quantity is ambiguous.
F: Decrease the equilibrium price but the change in quantity is ambiguous.

H: decrease the equilibrium quantity and decrease the price.
I: Increase the equilibrium quantity but decrease the price.
J: Increase the equilibrium price but decrease the quantity.

Okay, so I have this question about DVD players being a normal good in a competitive market. The question is asking what happens when household income increases, all else equal. The options are from A to J, and I need to pick the correct one.

First, I remember that a normal good is something where demand increases as income increases. DVD players are probably a normal good because when people have more money, they might buy more DVD players. But wait, sometimes I get confused between normal and inferior goods. Inferior goods have decreasing demand with higher income, right? So yeah, normal goods have positive income elasticity.

Now, in a competitive market, the equilibrium is where supply and demand meet. If income goes up, the demand for DVD players should go up because they're a normal good. So the demand curve shifts to the right. When the demand curve shifts right, what happens to equilibrium price and quantity?

I think both the equilibrium price and quantity would increase because the demand is higher, and the supply isn't changing immediately. The producers will see a higher price and might produce more, but in the short run, the immediate effect is that price goes up and so does quantity sold.

Wait, but the question says all else equal. So supply isn't changing because it's a competitive market, and the question doesn't mention changes in production costs or supply factors. So yeah, the supply curve is the same, and the demand curve shifts right, leading to higher price and higher quantity.

Looking at the options, G says increase both equilibrium quantity and price. That makes sense. But let me check other options to be sure.

Option E says price increases, but quantity change is ambiguous. Why would quantity be ambiguous? Because the question is about a normal good, so quantity should increase. So E doesn't seem right.

Option H says quantity decreases and price increases. No, that doesn't fit because higher income with a normal good should increase demand, leading to higher both.

Option J is price up, quantity down. That's contractionary, which doesn't fit here.

So the correct answer should be G: increase equilibrium quantity and price.

When household income increases and DVD players are a normal good, the demand for DVD players will rise, shifting the demand curve to the right. In a competitive market, this leads to an increase in both the equilibrium price and quantity. Therefore, the correct answer is:

G: increase the equilibrium quantity and increase the price.

Answer: G
