Okay, I need to figure out which crimes the defendants are guilty of. Let's break down the scenario step by step.

First, the victim was at home when the doorbell rang. When she opened the door, three defendants confronted her. They pushed her inside, tied her up with ropes, threatened her with bodily harm, and then ransacked her home. They took her valuables and other possessions in a sack and left quickly.

So, what's happening here? Let's list the actions:

1. They pushed her inside and tied her up. That sounds like they forced her into her home against her will, which could be kidnapping because they're holding her captive. Kidnapping involves taking someone against their will and holding them, often for ransom or another purpose.

2. Threatening her with bodily harm if she didn't cooperate. This is a form of assault because assault is the act of causing someone to fear imminent harmful or offensive contact. So, they're definitely committing assault here.

3. Ransacking her home and taking her valuables. Ransacking implies they're stealing, and taking the valuables is theft. But in criminal law, when you take someone's property while using force or fear, it's robbery. So, since they used threats (force) to get her to comply and then stole the items, that's robbery.

Now, looking at the options:

A: Assault only. Well, they did more than just assault. They also kidnapped and robbed, so this isn't right.

B: Kidnapping, assault, and robbery. This seems to cover all the points: they kidnapped her, assaulted her by threatening her, and then robbed her by taking the items under threat.

C: Kidnapping and larceny. Larceny is just theft without force. But they used force, so it's robbery, not larceny. So C is incorrect.

D: Robbery only. They did commit robbery, but they also kidnapped and assaulted, so D is incomplete.

E: Assault, battery, and robbery. Wait, assault and battery are often considered together. Assault is the threat, battery is the actual harmful contact. Did they hit her? The scenario says they threatened her but doesn't specify battery. So maybe E is not correct because battery isn't explicitly mentioned.

F: Robbery and burglary. Burglary is unlawful entry into a dwelling with intent to commit a felony. They entered her home when she opened the door, but since they forced their way in, that could be burglary. Plus, they committed robbery. So F includes robbery and burglary, but what about kidnapping? They tied her up and held her, which is kidnapping. So F misses the kidnapping charge.

G: Kidnapping, larceny, and burglary. Again, larceny isn't the right term here because they used force, making it robbery instead. So G is incorrect.

H: Larceny and assault. Again, missing robbery and kidnapping. Not right.

I: Larceny, robbery, and burglary. Larceny isn't correct as explained earlier. Plus, they kidnapped her, so I is missing that.

J: Assault, battery, larceny, and burglary. As before, battery isn't confirmed, and larceny isn't the right term. So J is wrong.

So the correct answer should include kidnapping, assault, and robbery. That's option B.

The defendants are guilty of kidnapping because they held the victim against her will. They committed assault by threatening her with bodily harm. Additionally, they used force to take her valuables, which constitutes robbery. Therefore, the crimes are kidnapping, assault, and robbery.

Answer: B
