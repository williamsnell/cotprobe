Okay, so I have to figure out whether the argument given is valid or invalid. The argument is:

~(M ≡ ~N)
M
/N

Alright, let me break this down. First, I need to construct a truth table for these statements. The argument has two premises and a conclusion. The premises are ~ (M ≡ ~N) and M, and the conclusion is N. 

I remember that in logic, an argument is valid if whenever the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true. If there's even one case where the premises are true but the conclusion is false, the argument is invalid, and that case is a counterexample.

So, let me start by writing out all possible truth values for M and N. Since there are two variables, there are four combinations: both true, both false, M true and N false, and M false and N true.

Let me list them:

1. M = T, N = T
2. M = T, N = F
3. M = F, N = T
4. M = F, N = F

For each of these, I'll compute the value of M ≡ ~N, then negate it to get the first premise, and then see if M is true. Then, check if the conclusion N follows.

Let's go step by step.

Case 1: M=T, N=T
- Compute ~N: N is T, so ~N is F.
- M ≡ ~N: T ≡ F? Well, logical equivalence (≡) is true when both sides are the same. So T and F are not equivalent. So M ≡ ~N is F.
- ~ (M ≡ ~N): Negation of F is T.
- Premise M: T.
- Conclusion N: T.
So in this case, premises are T and T, conclusion is T. So no problem here.

Case 2: M=T, N=F
- ~N: N is F, so ~N is T.
- M ≡ ~N: T ≡ T is T.
- ~(M ≡ ~N): F.
- Premise M: T.
So here, the first premise is F, so the premises are not both true. So this case doesn't affect the validity because for the argument to be invalid, there must be a case where premises are true and conclusion is false.

Case 3: M=F, N=T
- ~N: N=T, so ~N=F.
- M ≡ ~N: F ≡ F is T.
- ~(M ≡ ~N): F.
- Premise M: F.
So here, the first premise is F, so again, the premises aren't both true. Doesn't affect validity.

Case 4: M=F, N=F
- ~N: N=F, so ~N=T.
- M ≡ ~N: F ≡ T? No, so M ≡ ~N is F.
- ~(M ≡ ~N): T.
- Premise M: F.
So first premise is T, but M is F, so the premises aren't both true here either.

Wait, but I might have made a mistake. Let me check each case again more carefully.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the first premise correctly each time.

Let me make a table:

M | N | ~N | M ≡ ~N | ~(M ≡ ~N) | Premise M | Conclusion N

So for each case:

Case 1: M=T, N=T
~N=F
M ≡ ~N: T ≡ F → F
~(M ≡ ~N) → T
Premise M: T
Conclusion N: T
So premises are T and T, conclusion is T. So no issue.

Case 2: M=T, N=F
~N=T
M ≡ ~N: T ≡ T → T
~(M ≡ ~N) → F
Premise M: T
But since the first premise is F, the premises aren't both true. So no problem for validity.

Case 3: M=F, N=T
~N=F
M ≡ ~N: F ≡ F → T
~(M ≡ ~N) → F
Premise M: F
So again, first premise is F, so premises aren't both true.

Case 4: M=F, N=F
~N=T
M ≡ ~N: F ≡ T → F
~(M ≡ ~N) → T
Premise M: F
So here, first premise is T, but M is F. So premises aren't both true.

Wait, but I think I'm missing something. Maybe I should look for cases where both premises are true, and see if the conclusion is necessarily true.

So, the premises are ~ (M ≡ ~N) and M. So for the argument to be valid, whenever ~ (M ≡ ~N) is true and M is true, N must be true.

So I need to find all cases where ~ (M ≡ ~N) is T and M is T, and see if in those cases N is T.

Looking at the cases:

Case 1: M=T, N=T → ~ (M ≡ ~N) is T, M is T. So N is T. So conclusion holds.

Case 2: M=T, N=F → ~ (M ≡ ~N) is F, so premises not both T.

Case 3: M=F, N=T → ~ (M ≡ ~N) is F, so premises not both T.

Case 4: M=F, N=F → ~ (M ≡ ~N) is T, but M is F, so premises not both T.

Wait, so are there any cases where both premises are T? Only Case 1: M=T, N=T.

In that case, the conclusion N is T, so it's okay.

So the argument would be valid, right? Because whenever the premises are true, the conclusion is true.

Wait, but the options include E: Valid. So is that the answer?

Wait, but let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in evaluating ~ (M ≡ ~N).

Let me re-express ~ (M ≡ ~N) as ¬(M ↔ ¬N). 

Another approach: M ≡ ~N is equivalent to M ↔ ¬N, which is equivalent to (M → ¬N) ∧ (¬N → M). So the negation would be ¬(M ↔ ¬N) which is equivalent to M ↔ ¬(¬N), which is M ↔ N? Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, the negation of (A ↔ B) is (A ≠ B), so it's equivalent to (A ∧ ¬B) ∨ (¬A ∧ B).

Alternatively, perhaps using logical equivalences, I can simplify ~ (M ≡ ~N). Let's see:

M ≡ ~N is equivalent to (M ↔ ¬N). The negation of that is ¬(M ↔ ¬N) which is equivalent to (M ↔ N). Because ¬(A ↔ B) is equivalent to A ↔ ¬B, but wait, let me think again.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to compute the truth table for each part.

Alternatively, maybe I should write down all the possible cases again, but more carefully.

Let me try again:

For each combination of M and N:

1. M=T, N=T:
   ~N=F
   M ≡ ~N: T ≡ F → F
   ~(M ≡ ~N) → T
   M=T → premise holds
   Conclusion N=T. So when premises are true, conclusion is true.

2. M=T, N=F:
   ~N=T
   M ≡ ~N: T ≡ T → T
   ~(M ≡ ~N) → F
   So first premise is F, so premises not both true.

3. M=F, N=T:
   ~N=F
   M ≡ ~N: F ≡ F → T
   ~(M ≡ ~N) → F
   So first premise is F, premises not both true.

4. M=F, N=F:
   ~N=T
   M ≡ ~N: F ≡ T → F
   ~(M ≡ ~N) → T
   M=F → premise M is F, so premises not both true.

Wait, so in all cases except case 1, either one of the premises is false or the other. Only in case 1, both premises are true. And in that case, the conclusion is true.

So the argument is valid, because in the only case where both premises are true, the conclusion is also true.

But wait, the options don't include E as correct? Wait, the options are:

A: Invalid. Counterexample when M is false and N is false
B: Invalid. Counterexample when M and N are true
C: Invalid. Counterexample when N is false and M is true
D: Invalid. Counterexample when N is true and M is false
E: Valid
F: Invalid. Counterexample when M is false and N is true
G: Invalid. Counterexample when both M and N are false
H: Invalid. Counterexample when M and N alternate in truth value
I: Invalid. Counterexample when M is true and N is false

Wait, but according to my analysis, the argument is valid, so E is the answer. But let me double-check because sometimes I might have missed a case.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating ~ (M ≡ ~N). Let me take another approach. Let's compute the truth value of ~ (M ≡ ~N) for each case.

Case 1: M=T, N=T
~N=F
M ≡ ~N: T ≡ F → F
~(F) → T

Case 2: M=T, N=F
~N=T
M ≡ ~N: T ≡ T → T
~(T) → F

Case 3: M=F, N=T
~N=F
M ≡ ~N: F ≡ F → T
~(T) → F

Case 4: M=F, N=F
~N=T
M ≡ ~N: F ≡ T → F
~(F) → T

So the only time when ~ (M ≡ ~N) is T is when M and N have different truth values. Because in case 1, M=T, N=T: ~N=F, so M=T, ~N=F, so M ≡ ~N is F, so negation is T. Wait, but M=T and N=T leads to ~N=F, so M ≡ ~N is F, so ~ is T.

Wait, no, that's correct. So when M and N are both T, ~ (M ≡ ~N) is T, and M is T, so both premises are T, and N is T. So conclusion holds.

In case 4: M=F, N=F
~N=T
M ≡ ~N: F ≡ T → F
~(F) → T
So here, ~ (M ≡ ~N) is T, but M is F, so the second premise (M) is F. So premises aren't both T.

So the only time both premises are T is when M=T, N=T, which makes the conclusion T.

Therefore, the argument is valid because in the only case where premises are true, the conclusion is true. So the answer should be E: Valid.

Wait, but looking at the options, E is one of them. So the correct answer is E.

The argument is valid because in the only case where both premises are true, the conclusion is also true.
