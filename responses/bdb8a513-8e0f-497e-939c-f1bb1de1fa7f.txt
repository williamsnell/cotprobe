Okay, so Mr. Burke bought three bonds, right? Each bond has a par value of $1,000 and a 5.25% interest rate, since it's written as 5(1/4)%, which is 5.25%. The interest is paid semiannually. I need to figure out how much interest he'll receive in total.

First, I think I should calculate the interest for one bond and then multiply by three because he has three of them. Let's break it down step by step.

Each bond is $1,000, and the annual interest rate is 5.25%. So the annual interest for one bond would be 5.25% of $1,000. To calculate that, I can convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100. So 5.25% becomes 0.0525. Then, 0.0525 multiplied by $1,000 equals $52.50 per year. 

But wait, the interest is paid semiannually, which means twice a year. So I need to split that annual interest into two equal payments. That would be $52.50 divided by 2, which is $26.25 every six months. 

Since Mr. Burke owns three such bonds, I multiply the semiannual interest from one bond by three. So $26.25 times 3 equals $78.75. 

Looking at the options, D is $78.75. So that must be the correct answer.

The interest per bond per半年 is $1,000 × 5.25% / 2 = $26.25. For three bonds, it's 3 × $26.25 = $78.75.

Answer: D
