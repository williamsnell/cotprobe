Okay, so I've got this question about the SEC and audit committees. I'm a bit rusty on my securities regulations, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking what members of an issuer's audit committee may NOT do according to the SEC. The options are A through F. Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A says they can establish procedures for receiving, retaining, and treating complaints about accounting or auditing matters. I remember that the audit committee is responsible for handling such issues, so this is something they can and should do. So A is allowed, meaning it's not the answer.

Option B says they can engage independent counsel if needed. That makes sense because the audit committee often needs legal advice, especially when dealing with complex issues. So B is allowed, not the answer.

Option C states they cannot accept any consulting or compensatory fees from the registrant except as a board member. Wait, I think there's a rule about audit committee members not accepting additional compensation from the company. Like, they can't be paid for other roles beyond their board service. So if they're on the audit committee, they shouldn't get extra fees for other services. So C might be the correct answer, but I need to check the others.

Option D says they can't serve on another company's board. I don't recall the SEC restricting audit committee members from serving on other boards, as long as it's disclosed and doesn't create a conflict. So D is probably allowed, so not the answer.

Option E talks about establishing procedures for anonymous fraud reporting. That sounds like part of their responsibility, especially after the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which emphasized internal controls and reporting mechanisms. So E is allowed, not the answer.

Option F says they can't serve on more than three audit committees. I think there's a rule about the number of audit committees an individual can serve on, but I'm not sure if it's more than three. Wait, SEC rules do limit the number to prevent overcommitment, so maybe F is something they can't do. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact number.

Wait, going back to the options. The question is what they MAY NOT do. So looking at C again: accepting consulting fees from the registrant. I think Rule 2.07 of Regulation S-X prohibits audit committee members from accepting such fees. So C is something they cannot do, making C the correct answer. But I'm a bit confused because I thought the rule was about compensation beyond their board service, which C is about. So I think C is the right choice.

The correct answer is C. Audit committee members are prohibited from accepting consulting or compensatory fees from the issuer for services other than their board membership, as per SEC regulations.

Answer: C
