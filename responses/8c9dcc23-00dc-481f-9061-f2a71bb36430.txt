Okay, so I have this graph problem here, and I need to find the shortest path from node 0 to node 5. Let me try to visualize the graph first based on the given edges.

The edges are E = {<0,1>, <0,2>, <0,3>, <3,5>, <2,3>, <2,4>, <4,5>}. So, node 0 is connected to 1, 2, and 3. Then, node 3 is connected to 5 and also to node 2. Node 2 is connected to 4, and node 4 is connected to 5. So, looking at this, I can draw the connections:

- 0 is connected directly to 1, 2, 3.
- 1 doesn't connect further except to 0.
- 2 connects to 0, 3, and 4.
- 3 connects to 0, 2, and 5.
- 4 connects to 2 and 5.
- 5 is connected to 3 and 4.

I need the shortest path from 0 to 5. Let's list possible paths.

First, let me think about the direct connections. From 0, I can go to 3 directly, and from 3, I can go to 5. So that's 0 ->3 ->5. That's two edges, right? Let me see the options. Option H is [0,3,5], which is two steps. That's pretty short.

Wait, but are there any shorter paths? Well, the graph is undirected, so the path can't be shorter than two edges because 0 isn't directly connected to 5. Let me check other possibilities.

Another path could be 0->2->3->5. That's three steps. Or 0->2->4->5, which is also three steps. Or 0->3->2->4->5, which is four steps. Or 0->1->... but 1 doesn't connect to anything else except 0, so that's a dead end.

So, the shortest path is definitely two steps: 0->3->5. So the path is [0,3,5], which is option H.

Wait, but let me double-check. Are there any other two-step paths? From 0, can I go to another node and reach 5 in one more step? The nodes directly connected to 0 are 1, 2, 3. From 0, 3 connects to 5, so that's the only two-step path. The other nodes (1 and 2) don't connect directly to 5. For example, 0->2 can go to 4, but 4 connects to 5, which is a third step. So option E is [0,2,4,5], which is three steps, longer than H.

So the correct answer should be H.

The shortest path from node 0 to node 5 is [0,3,5], which is option H.

Answer: H
