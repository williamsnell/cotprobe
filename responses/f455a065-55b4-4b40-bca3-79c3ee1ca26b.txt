Okay, so I have this question about rule consequentialism, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me start by recalling what I know about this topic.

Rule consequentialism is a theory in ethics that evaluates the rightness or wrongness of an action based on the consequences of the rules that govern it. I remember that it's different from act consequentialism, which looks at the consequences of each individual action. Rule consequentialism instead looks at the consequences of the rules themselves.

The question is asking what rule consequentialism depends on for determining if an action is right or wrong. Let's look at the options one by one.

Option A: This talks about individual beliefs and morals. I think that's more related to deontological ethics or maybe virtue ethics, where personal principles guide the decision. Rule consequentialism isn't about personal beliefs; it's about the rules and their outcomes.

Option B: It mentions whether a virtuous person would endorse a rule. That sounds a bit like virtue ethics, where the character of the virtuous person is central. Rule consequentialism is more about rules and their consequences, not about the endorsement by a virtuous person.

Option C: This is about the action's relationship to the law. While laws are rules, rule consequentialism isn't specifically about legal rules but about moral rules in general. So this might not be the right choice.

Option D: Aligning with human rights. While important, this seems more like a separate ethical framework rather than rule consequentialism's basis.

Option E: Immediate consequences. That's more like act consequentialism, where each action's immediate outcomes are considered, not the rules.

Option F: Logical consistency of motives. This seems more like a deontological approach, focusing on the motive's consistency rather than the consequences of rules.

Option G: Religious approval. That's more about divine command theory, not rule consequentialism.

Option H: Alignment with utilitarianism. Utilitarianism is about maximizing overall happiness, which is similar but different. Rule consequentialism uses a rule-based approach to achieve the best consequences, so this is close but not exactly the same.

Option I: Societal norms and customs. This could be part of a cultural approach but doesn't directly address rule consequentialism's focus on the consequences of rules.

Option J: Whether the action is required, permitted, or prohibited by a rule whose consequences are best. This seems to fit. Rule consequentialism evaluates rules based on their overall consequences and then applies those rules to actions. So, if a rule leads to the best outcomes, actions following it are considered right.

Wait, let me double-check. Rule consequentialism says that an action is right if it conforms to the rules that produce the best overall consequences. So the rightness depends on the rule's consequences. Option J says that the rightness depends on whether the action is required, permitted, or prohibited by a rule whose consequences are best. That sounds exactly right.

So the answer should be J.

The correct answer is J because rule consequentialism evaluates the rightness or wrongness of an action based on whether it aligns with a rule that produces the best overall consequences.
