Options:

A: G(ab)
B: aGb
C: aGba
D: ~Gba
E: Gba
F: Gaa
G: Gab
H: Gb~a
I: Gbb
J: Ga/b

Answer:

Okay, so I have this question about translating a sentence into predicate logic. The sentence is "Alexis is greeted by Ben." The options are A through J, and I need to pick the correct one. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that in predicate logic, predicates are usually written as uppercase letters followed by variables or constants. Here, the predicate given is Gxy, which means "x greets y." So, G stands for the action of greeting, and x and y are the subjects involved.

The sentence says "Alexis is greeted by Ben." So I need to identify who is doing the greeting and who is receiving it. The structure is that Ben is the one doing the greeting, and Alexis is the one being greeted. So in terms of the predicate Gxy, x would be Ben, and y would be Alexis because x is the one greeting y.

Wait, but sometimes it's easy to get confused about who is x and who is y. Let me clarify. The predicate Gxy is "x greets y." So if Ben is greeting Alexis, then Ben is x and Alexis is y. So Gxy would be G(b)(a), right? Because b is Ben and a is Alexis. So that would translate to Gba, because x is Ben (b) and y is Alexis (a). So the predicate becomes G(b)(a), which is written as Gba.

Now looking at the options, option E is Gba. So that seems correct. But let me check the other options to be sure.

Option A is G(ab). That would mean a greets b, which would be Alexis greeting Ben, but the sentence is the opposite, so A is wrong.

Option B is aGb. Hmm, that's not standard notation. Usually, it's G followed by the variables. So B might not be correct.

Option C is aGba. That looks like a four-letter term, but in predicate logic, G takes two arguments, so Gba would be correct as a two-variable predicate.

Option D is ~Gba, which is the negation. But the sentence isn't negative, so D is out.

Option E is Gba, which as I figured earlier, is Ben greeting Alexis. That seems right.

Option F is Gaa, which would mean Alexis greets herself. Not the case here.

Option G is Gab. Wait, G is the predicate, so Gab would mean G(a)(b), which is Alexis greets Ben. That's the opposite of what we want, so G is incorrect.

Option H is Gb~a. The ~ usually means negation, so this might mean Ben does not greet a, but the sentence isn't negative, so H is wrong.

Option I is Gbb, meaning Ben greets Ben. Not the case here.

Option J is Ga/b. I'm not sure what the slash means. Maybe it's a typo or something else. Probably not the correct notation.

So after going through each option, E: Gba seems to be the correct translation because it correctly represents Ben (b) greeting Alexis (a).

The sentence "Alexis is greeted by Ben" translates to Ben greeting Alexis. In predicate logic, Gxy means "x greets y." Here, Ben (b) is x, and Alexis (a) is y, making the correct predicate Gba.

Answer: E
