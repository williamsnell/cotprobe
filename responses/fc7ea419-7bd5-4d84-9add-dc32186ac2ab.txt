Okay, so I'm trying to find the fundamental period of the function f(x) given in the problem. Hmm, let me first understand what the function looks like.

The function is defined piecewise for different intervals. It says that for each integer n (which can be positive, negative, or zero), when x is between 2n-1 and 2n, the function f(x) is (-1)^n. And when x is between 2n and 2n+1, f(x) is 1.

Wait, maybe I should write out what this looks like for specific values of n to visualize it better.

For n=0:
- When x is between 2(0)-1 = -1 and 2(0)=0, f(x) is (-1)^0 = 1.
- Then, when x is between 0 and 1 (since 2(0)=0 and 2(0)+1=1), f(x)=1.

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, n=0 gives us two intervals. Let me recast that.

Wait, for n=0:
- The first interval is 2n-1 ≤ x < 2n. So 2(0)-1 = -1 ≤ x < 0. In this interval, f(x)=(-1)^0=1.

Then, the next interval is 2n ≤ x < 2n+1. For n=0, that's 0 ≤ x < 1. Here, f(x)=1.

Wait, but for n=1:
- The first interval is 2(1)-1=1 ≤ x < 2(1)=2. So x is between 1 and 2. Here, f(x)=(-1)^1 = -1.

Then, the next interval is 2 ≤ x < 3. f(x)=1.

Similarly, for n=-1:
- The first interval is 2(-1)-1 =-3 ≤ x < -2. f(x)=(-1)^(-1) = -1, since (-1) raised to an odd power is -1.

Then, the next interval is -2 ≤ x < -1. Here, f(x)=1.

Wait, so putting this together, the function alternates between 1 and -1 in intervals of length 1 each. Let me list the intervals and their corresponding f(x) values.

n=-1:
- x ∈ [-3, -2): f(x)=-1
- x ∈ [-2, -1): f(x)=1

n=0:
- x ∈ [-1, 0): f(x)=1
- x ∈ [0, 1): f(x)=1

Wait, that's not possible because when n=0, the first interval is [-1, 0) and f(x)=1, and then [0,1) is also 1. But for n=1, from [1,2) it's -1, then [2,3) is 1.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me recheck.

Wait, for n=0, the intervals are:

2n-1 = -1 ≤ x < 2n=0 → f(x)=1.

Then, 2n=0 ≤x <2n+1=1 → f(x)=1.

So from x=-1 to x=0, f(x)=1; from x=0 to x=1, f(x)=1. Then for n=1:

2(1)-1=1 ≤x<2 → f(x)=(-1)^1=-1.

Then, 2 ≤x<3 → f(x)=1.

Similarly, for n=-1:

2(-1)-1=-3 ≤x < -2 → f(x)=(-1)^(-1)=-1.

Then, -2 ≤x < -1 → f(x)=1.

Wait, but this seems to create a function that is 1 from x=-3 to -2, then -1 from -2 to -1, then 1 from -1 to 0, 1 from 0 to 1, -1 from 1 to 2, and 1 from 2 to 3, etc.

Wait, that can't be right because from -1 to 0 and 0 to 1, both are 1. Hmm, maybe I'm miscalculating the intervals.

Wait, perhaps the function is defined as:

For each integer n, the function alternates between (-1)^n on [2n-1, 2n) and 1 on [2n, 2n+1).

So for n=0:

[2(0)-1, 2(0)) = [-1, 0). f(x)=1.

[2(0), 2(0)+1) = [0,1). f(x)=1.

For n=1:

[2(1)-1, 2(1)) = [1,2). f(x)=-1.

[2(1), 2(1)+1) = [2,3). f(x)=1.

For n=-1:

[2(-1)-1, 2(-1)) = [-3, -2). f(x)=(-1)^(-1)=-1.

[2(-1), 2(-1)+1) = [-2, -1). f(x)=1.

So putting it all together, the function looks like this:

From x=-3 to -2: f(x)=-1

x=-2 to -1: f(x)=1

x=-1 to 0: f(x)=1

x=0 to 1: f(x)=1

x=1 to 2: f(x)=-1

x=2 to 3: f(x)=1

And this pattern repeats every 2 units.

Wait, but looking at the function, from x=-2 to x=1, which is a span of 3 units, the function is 1 from -2 to -1, 1 from -1 to 0, and 1 from 0 to 1. So that's three intervals of 1. Then from 1 to 2, it's -1, and from 2 to 3, it's 1 again. Hmm, maybe the period is 2?

Wait, let me check another part. From x=1 to x=3, the function goes from -1 to 1. So maybe the pattern is every two units. Let's see if f(x + T) = f(x) for T=2.

Let me pick x=0.5, which is in [0,1), so f(0.5)=1.

f(0.5 + 2)=f(2.5), which is in [2,3), so f(2.5)=1. That's same.

x=1.5: in [1,2), f(1.5)=-1.

f(1.5 +2)=f(3.5), which is in [3,4). For n=2, [3,4) would be 2*2=4? Wait, wait, no. Let me compute for n=1:

[2(1),2(1)+1) is [2,3). So for x=3.5, which is greater than 3, so n=2: 2(2)-1=3 ≤x<4, so x=3.5 is in [3,4), so f(3.5)=(-1)^2=1.

Wait, but f(1.5)=-1, and f(3.5)=1. So f(x+2) is not equal to f(x) in this case. That suggests that T=2 is not a period because the function changes from -1 to 1 after adding 2.

Hmm, that's confusing. Maybe I made a mistake in the intervals.

Wait, let me reconstruct the function correctly.

Wait, for each n, the function alternates between (-1)^n on [2n-1, 2n) and 1 on [2n, 2n+1).

So for n=0:

[ -1, 0 ) → f(x)=1.

[0,1) → f(x)=1.

n=1:

[1,2) → f(x)=-1.

[2,3) → f(x)=1.

n=2:

[3,4) → f(x)=1 (since (-1)^2=1).

[4,5) → f(x)=1.

Wait, no, wait, n=2: [2(2)-1,2(2)) → [3,4). So f(x)=(-1)^2=1.

Then [4,5): f(x)=1.

Wait, so from x=3 to 4, it's 1, and from 4 to 5, it's 1. So that suggests that every even n, the function is 1 on [2n-1, 2n+1), perhaps? Or maybe I'm getting the intervals wrong.

Wait, perhaps it's better to plot the function step by step.

Let me list the intervals and their corresponding f(x) values:

n=-2:
- [2*(-2)-1, 2*(-2)) → [-5, -4): f(x)=(-1)^(-2)=1 (since (-1)^even is 1).

- [-4, -3): f(x)=1.

n=-1:
- [-3, -2): f(x)=(-1)^(-1)=-1.

- [-2, -1): f(x)=1.

n=0:
- [-1, 0): f(x)=1.

- [0,1): f(x)=1.

n=1:
- [1,2): f(x)= (-1)^1 = -1.

- [2,3): f(x)=1.

n=2:
- [3,4): f(x)= (-1)^2=1.

- [4,5): f(x)=1.

n=3:
- [5,6): f(x)= (-1)^3=-1.

- [6,7): f(x)=1.

And so on.

Wait, so from x=-5 to x=5, the function looks like:

- x ∈ [-5, -4): 1

- x ∈ [-4, -3): 1

- x ∈ [-3, -2): -1

- x ∈ [-2, -1): 1

- x ∈ [-1, 0): 1

- x ∈ [0,1): 1

- x ∈ [1,2): -1

- x ∈ [2,3): 1

- x ∈ [3,4): 1

- x ∈ [4,5): 1

- x ∈ [5,6): -1

And so on.

Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me see the pattern. It seems that between even and odd intervals, the function alternates between 1 and -1.

Wait, perhaps it's better to see the function as follows:

Between x=2k-1 and x=2k, where k is an integer, f(x)=(-1)^k.

And between x=2k and x=2k+1, f(x)=1.

So, for each integer k, the interval [2k-1, 2k) has f(x)=(-1)^k, and [2k, 2k+1) has f(x)=1.

Wait, that makes the function have a pattern every 2 units? Let me test that.

Let me see the values at x=0.5, which is in [0,1). So f(0.5)=1.

At x=0.5 + 2 =2.5, which is in [2,3), so f(2.5)=1. So same value.

x=1.5 is in [1,2), f(1.5)=-1.

x=1.5 + 2=3.5, which is in [3,4). f(3.5)=1.

Hmm, so f(1.5)=-1, f(3.5)=1. Not the same, so T=2 is not a period.

Wait, maybe T=4? Let's check.

x=0.5 → f=1. x=0.5+4=4.5. 4.5 is in [4,5), so f=1. Same.

x=1.5 → f=-1. x=1.5+4=5.5. 5.5 is in [5,6), so f(x)=(-1)^3=-1. So same.

x=2.5 → f=1. x=6.5 → in [6,7), f=1. Same.

Hmm, that seems to work. So maybe the period is 4? Let me check another point.

x=3.5 is in [3,4), f=1. x=3.5+4=7.5, which is in [7,8). For n=3: [6,7) is n=3's [2*3, 2*3+1)= [6,7), so f=1. Then [7,8) would be n=4's [2*4,2*4+1)= [8,9), wait no, wait:

Wait, for x=7.5, which is in [7,8). Let's find n such that 2n ≤7.5 <2n+1.

Wait, 2n ≤7.5 → n ≤3.75. The largest integer n is 3, so 2n=6, so x=7.5 is in [6,7) for n=3? No, wait 2n=6, so [6,7) is n=3. Then [7,8) would require n=4, because 2*4=8.

Wait, no, wait, for x=7.5, which is between 7 and 8, so 2n ≤7.5 <2n+1 → n=3.5? Wait, but n must be integer. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of k where x ∈ [2k-1, 2k) or [2k, 2k+1). So for x=7.5, which is between 7 and 8, which is 2*3.5 ≤x <2*(3.5)+1? Wait, no, because n must be integer. So for x=7.5, it's in [6,7) when n=3 (since 2*3=6, 2*3+1=7), so f(x)=1.

Wait, but 7.5 is in [7,8), which is for n=4? No, because 2n=8, so [7,8) is actually not a defined interval. Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the intervals.

Wait, for n=3: [2*3 -1, 2*3) → [5,6): f(x)=(-1)^3=-1.

Then [6,7): f(x)=1.

n=4: [7,8): f(x)=(-1)^4=1.

Wait, no, wait, for n=4: [2*4-1, 2*4) → [7,8): f(x)=(-1)^4=1.

Wait, that can't be because 2n-1 for n=4 is 7, so [7,8): f(x)=1.

Then, [8,9): f(x)=1.

So for x=7.5, which is in [7,8), f(x)=1.

Similarly, x=3.5 is in [3,4), which is for n=2: [3,4), so f(x)=1.

So, if T=4, then adding 4 to x=3.5 gives x=7.5, both in [3,4) and [7,8), both f(x)=1. Similarly, x=1.5: f(x)=-1, and x=5.5: [5,6) is for n=3: f(x)=-1. So yes, T=4 works.

Wait, but earlier when I tried T=2, it didn't work for x=1.5. Let me check T=4 again for x=1.5.

x=1.5: f(x)=-1. x=5.5: which is in [5,6), so f(x)=(-1)^3=-1. So same value.

Similarly, x=2.5: in [2,3), f=1. x=6.5: in [6,7), f=1. Same.

So it seems that T=4 is a period. Now, is it the fundamental period? Or is there a smaller period?

Wait, maybe T=2 is not a period, but perhaps T=4 is the fundamental period. Let me check if T=2 is a period.

Wait, for x=1.5, f(x)=-1. x=1.5+2=3.5, which is in [3,4), f(x)=1. So f(3.5)=1, which is not equal to f(1.5)=-1. So T=2 is not a period.

What about T=1? Let's see.

x=1.5: f(x)=-1. x=2.5: in [2,3), f=1. Not same. So T=1 is not a period.

What about T=3? Let's check.

x=1.5: f(x)=-1. x=4.5: in [4,5), f(x)=1. Not same. So T=3 not a period.

T=5? x=1.5: f(x)=-1. x=6.5: in [6,7), f=1. Not same.

What about T=4? As we saw earlier, it works. Let me check another point.

x=0.5: f=1. x=4.5: in [4,5), f=1. Same.

x=2.5: f=1. x=6.5: f=1.

x=3.5: f=1. x=7.5: f=1.

x=5.5: f=-1. x=9.5: in [9,10), which would be for n=5: [9,10), f(x)=(-1)^5=-1. So same.

So T=4 seems to be a period. Now, is there a smaller period than 4?

Wait, let me check T=2 again. Maybe I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, for x=0.5: f=1. x=2.5: f=1. Same.

x=1.5: f=-1. x=3.5: f=1. Not same.

So T=2 is not a period because f(x+2) ≠ f(x) for x=1.5.

What about T=4? It seems to work for all the points I checked.

Alternatively, maybe the function is periodic with period 2, but I must have made a mistake in my initial analysis.

Wait, perhaps I should graph the function to see its behavior.

From x=-3 to x=3, the function looks like:

- x ∈ [-3, -2): -1

- x ∈ [-2, -1): 1

- x ∈ [-1, 0): 1

- x ∈ [0,1): 1

- x ∈ [1,2): -1

- x ∈ [2,3): 1

From x=3 onward:

- x ∈ [3,4): 1

- x ∈ [4,5): 1

- x ∈ [5,6): -1

And so on.

Wait, so the pattern seems to be:

- From 2k-1 to 2k: f(x)=(-1)^k.

- From 2k to 2k+1: f(x)=1.

So for k even, (-1)^k is 1. For k odd, it's -1.

Thus, the function alternates between 1 and -1 every 1 unit, but perhaps the pattern repeats every 2 units.

Wait, but when I shift x by 2 units, does the function repeat?

Looking at the intervals, from x=0 to x=1: f=1.

From x=2 to x=3: f=1.

From x=1 to x=2: f=-1.

From x=3 to x=4: f=1.

So between 0 and 2, the function is 1, then -1, then 1.

Between 2 and 4, it's 1, then -1, then 1.

So yes, the pattern from 0 to 2 is 1 (0-1), -1 (1-2), and then 1 again (2-3). So if I shift by 2, the same pattern repeats.

Wait, but earlier I thought that f(x+2) wasn't equal to f(x) for x=1.5. But maybe I made a mistake in the intervals.

Wait, x=1.5 is in [1,2), so f(x)=-1.

x=3.5 is in [3,4), which is part of n=2: [3,4) → f(x)=1.

Wait, so f(1.5)=-1, and f(3.5)=1. So f(x+2)≠f(x), which suggests that T=2 is not a period.

Hmm, this is confusing. Maybe the function isn't periodic with T=2, but with T=4.

Wait, let me check x=1.5: f=-1. x=5.5: in [5,6), which is n=3: [5,6) → f(x)= (-1)^3=-1. So f(5.5)=-1, same as f(1.5)=-1.

Similarly, x=3.5: [3,4), n=2: f=1. x=7.5: [7,8), n=4: f=1. So same.

x=0.5: [0,1), f=1. x=4.5: [4,5), f=1.

x=2.5: [2,3), f=1. x=6.5: [6,7), f=1.

So T=4 seems to work. Therefore, the fundamental period is 4.

Wait, but I thought maybe T=2 was a period, but it's not because certain points don't repeat. So the fundamental period must be 4.
</think>

The function alternates between 1 and -1 in intervals of length 1, repeating every 4 units. Testing smaller periods like 2 or 1 shows they are not valid, confirming the fundamental period is 4.
