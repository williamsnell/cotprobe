Okay, so I've got this question about the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) and implied warranties. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is about the implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose. I remember that the UCC deals with sales of goods, and there are different types of warranties implied by law unless disclaimed.

From what I recall, there are two main implied warranties under the UCC: the warranty of title and the warranty of fitness for a particular purpose. The warranty of fitness is when the seller knows that the buyer is purchasing the goods for a specific use and the seller has the expertise or skill that the buyer relies on to select the right product.

So the key elements here are: the seller's knowledge of the buyer's purpose and the buyer's reliance on the seller's skill or judgment. That makes sense because if the seller is a professional in that field, the buyer might trust their expertise to choose the right product.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Seller knows the purpose and is a professional. Hmm, that's part of it, but I think it's more about the buyer relying on the seller's skill, not just the seller being a professional.

Option B: Seller knows the purpose, but the buyer isn't relying on the seller's skill. Wait, that's the opposite of what I remember. The warranty arises when the buyer does rely on the seller's skill, so this might not be correct.

Option C: Buyer relies on seller's reputation, not skill. I'm not sure if reputation alone is enough. The UCC focuses more on the actual reliance on skill or judgment, not just reputation.

Option D: Buyer buys for a purpose and seller is a merchant. Being a merchant is important, but I think it's the combination of knowing the purpose and the reliance that's key.

Option E: Buyer relies on seller's skill. This sounds closer, but does it require the seller to know the purpose? I think both elements are necessary.

Option F: Seller knows the purpose and the buyer relies on their skill. That seems to cover both elements I was thinking of: seller's knowledge and buyer's reliance. This looks like the correct one.

Option G: Seller knows purpose and is a merchant. Similar to D, but again, the reliance on skill might be needed.

Option H: Seller doesn't know the purpose but is a merchant. No, because the seller must know the purpose for the warranty to apply.

Option I: Buyer buys for general purpose. No, because it's specific to a particular purpose.

Option J: Buyer for a purpose, seller not a merchant. But I think the seller needs to be a merchant because that's part of the implied warranty.

So putting it together, the implied warranty arises when the seller knows the buyer's purpose and the buyer relies on the seller's skill or judgment. That points to option F.

The implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose under the UCC arises when the seller knows the buyer's specific purpose for purchasing the goods and the buyer relies on the seller's skill or judgment to select suitable products. This requires both knowledge of the purpose and reliance on the seller's expertise.
