Okay, so I have this physics problem here about gauge pressure in a water storage tank. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. 

The question says that water stands 12.0 meters deep in a storage tank with an open top. I need to find the gauge pressure at the bottom of the tank, and the options are given in units of 10^5 Pascals. 

Wait, what's gauge pressure again? Oh right, gauge pressure is the pressure relative to atmospheric pressure. So, it's the pressure exerted by the water column minus the atmospheric pressure at the top. But wait, the tank is open to the atmosphere, so the pressure at the top is just atmospheric pressure. But since we're talking gauge pressure at the bottom, maybe it's just the pressure due to the water depth because atmospheric pressure cancels out at both ends? Or does it?

No, wait. The gauge pressure is the pressure above atmospheric. So, if the tank is open, the atmospheric pressure is the same at the top and the bottom, so the gauge pressure at the bottom should be the pressure due to the water column. Because gauge pressure is measured relative to atmospheric, which is already accounted for by the open top.

So the formula I need is the hydrostatic pressure, which is P = ρgh. Where ρ is the density of water, g is acceleration due to gravity, and h is the height of the water.

I remember that the density of water is about 1000 kg/m³. And g is approximately 9.81 m/s². The height h is 12 meters.

Plugging in the numbers: P = 1000 kg/m³ * 9.81 m/s² * 12 m.

Let me calculate that. 1000 * 9.81 is 9810. Then 9810 *12 = let's see, 9810 *10 is 98100, 9810*2=19620, so total is 117720. So P is 117720 Pascals.

Wait, the question asks for the answer in units of 10^5 Pa. So I need to express 117720 Pa as 1.1772 * 10^5 Pa. But wait, looking at the options, they're all in 10^5 Pa units, so I should round this to the nearest hundredth or so.

1.1772 is approximately 1.18 when rounded to three decimal places. Let me check the options again. Option G is 1.18, so that would be the answer.

Wait, but wait a second. Did I consider atmospheric pressure correctly? Gauge pressure is the pressure above atmospheric, so in a closed container, if the top was sealed, we'd have to include atmospheric pressure, but since it's open, the atmospheric pressure at the top and bottom cancel out, so gauge pressure is just ρgh. So yes, my calculation should be correct.
</think>

The gauge pressure at the bottom of the tank is calculated using the formula for hydrostatic pressure, \( P = \rho g h \), where \( \rho \) is the density of water (1000 kg/m³), \( g \) is acceleration due to gravity (9.81 m/s²), and \( h \) is the height of the water (12 m). Substituting these values gives \( P = 1000 \times 9.81 \times 12 = 117720 \) Pa, which is approximately \( 1.18 \times 10^5 \) Pa. Since the tank is open to the atmosphere, atmospheric pressure cancels out, leaving only the pressure due to the water column.
