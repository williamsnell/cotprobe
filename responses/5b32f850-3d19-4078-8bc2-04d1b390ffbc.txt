Question:

If the total overhead is $44,733, the total direct labor is $185,600, and the total materials used are $54,900, find (a) the overhead percent of prime cost, (b) the overhead charge to a department with a prime cost of $32,600.

Options:

A: 23.1%, $7,543.60
B: 21.4%, $6,964.40
C: 17.8%, $5,810.80
D: 22.3%, $7,200

Okay, so I've got this problem here about the Adam Manufacturing Co. and their overhead distribution. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to figure it out step by step.

The question says that Adam uses the ratio of total overhead to total prime cost to distribute overhead. So, I think that means they calculate overhead as a percentage of prime costs and then apply that percentage wherever needed.

Let me jot down the given numbers:
- Total overhead = $44,733
- Total direct labor = $185,600
- Total materials used = $54,900

I need to find two things: (a) the overhead percent of prime cost, and (b) the overhead charge for a department with a prime cost of $32,600.

First, I should figure out what prime cost is. From what I remember, prime costs are the direct costs involved in production, which include direct materials and direct labor. So, prime cost here would be the sum of materials used and direct labor.

Calculating prime cost:
Prime Cost = Direct Labor + Materials Used
So, that's $185,600 (labor) + $54,900 (materials) = $240,500 total prime cost.

Now, the overhead percentage of prime cost is calculated by dividing total overhead by total prime cost and then multiplying by 100 to get a percentage.

So, Overhead % = (Total Overhead / Total Prime Cost) * 100
Plugging in the numbers: ($44,733 / $240,500) * 100.

Let me compute that. First, divide 44,733 by 240,500. Hmm, let's see. 44,733 รท 240,500. I can approximate this.

Well, 240,500 * 0.18 = 43,290, which is close to 44,733. Let me do it more accurately.

44,733 รท 240,500 = 0.186 (approx 18.6%).

Wait, let me check that again. 240,500 * 0.18 = 43,290. 240,500 * 0.186 = let's calculate:

0.186 * 240,500 = 240,500 * 0.1 + 240,500 * 0.08 + 240,500 * 0.006.

0.1 * 240,500 = 24,050
0.08 * 240,500 = 19,240
0.006 * 240,500 = 1,443
Adding them up: 24,050 + 19,240 = 43,290; plus 1,443 is 44,733. Perfect! So the overhead percentage is 18.6%.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is 17.8%, G is 18.6%, etc. So for part (a), the overhead percent is 18.6%, which corresponds to option G or maybe another option. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options:
C: 17.8%, $5,810.80
G: 18.6%, $6,063.60

So, part (a) is 18.6%, which is option G's first value. But let me also check part (b) to see if it matches.

Part (b) is the overhead charge for a department with a prime cost of $32,600. Since the overhead percentage is 18.6%, we can calculate the overhead charge as 18.6% of 32,600.

Calculating that: 32,600 * 0.186.

Let me compute this step by step.

First, 32,600 * 0.1 = 3,260
32,600 * 0.08 = 2,608
32,600 * 0.006 = 195.6

Adding them up:
3,260 + 2,608 = 5,868
5,868 + 195.6 = 6,063.6

So the overhead charge is $6,063.60.

Looking back at the options, option G is 18.6% and $6,063.60, which matches both (a) and (b). So the correct answer should be option G.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because another option, option C, has a lower percentage. Did I make a mistake in calculating prime cost? Let me double-check.

Prime cost is direct labor plus materials: 185,600 + 54,900 = 240,500. That's correct. Then 44,733 / 240,500 = 0.186, which is 18.6%. So part (a) is 18.6%, part (b) is 6,063.60, so option G is correct.
</think>

The overhead percent of prime cost is calculated by dividing total overhead by total prime cost and multiplying by 100. The total prime cost is the sum of direct labor and materials used, which is $185,600 + $54,900 = $240,500. Dividing $44,733 by $240,500 gives approximately 18.6%. For the overhead charge to a department with a prime cost of $32,600, applying the 18.6% rate results in $6,063.60.
