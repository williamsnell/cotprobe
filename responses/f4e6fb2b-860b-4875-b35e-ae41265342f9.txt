Okay, I've got this thermodynamics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. So the question is about calculating the change in entropy (ΔS) for a mole of solid copper that's expanding isothermally from 200.0 atm to 1.0 atm. They've given me the coefficient of volume expansion α and the density d. Hmm, I remember that entropy change for an isothermal process in solids can be calculated using a specific formula, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Let me think.

First, the formula for entropy change when the process is isothermal. I think it's something like ΔS = nR ln(V2/V1), but wait, that's for ideal gases, right? Oh, right, for solids, it's a bit different because their volume doesn't change much, but in this case, the pressure is changing a lot. Wait, no, solids can still expand a little under pressure changes, I guess.

Wait, the problem gives me α, the coefficient of volume expansion. I remember that α is related to how volume changes with temperature, but here the temperature is constant (isothermal), so maybe I should think about how volume changes with pressure instead.

Oh, right! For solids, the change in volume with pressure can be expressed using the bulk modulus or something similar. But I don't have the bulk modulus here; instead, I have α. Hmm, maybe I can relate the volume change to pressure change using α.

Wait, no. Since the process is isothermal, the formula I think I need is ΔS = ∫(∂P/∂T)_V dV, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, I remember that for solids, the entropy change upon expansion can be calculated using the formula ΔS = nR ln(P1/P2) multiplied by some factor involving α. Or maybe it's ΔS = -nR ln(P2/P1) multiplied by α or something like that. I'm getting a bit confused.

Let me write down what's given. 1 mole of solid copper. Initial pressure P1 is 200.0 atm, final P2 is 1.0 atm. Isothermal expansion, so temperature T is constant. α is 1.66e-5 K^-1. Density d is 8.96e3 kg/m³.

Wait, the formula I think I should use is ΔS = nR ∫(1/V) dV from V1 to V2, but since it's a solid, the integral might involve the expansion coefficient α. Alternatively, I recall that for solids, the entropy change upon expansion can be approximated by ΔS = -V α ln(P2/P1), but I'm not entirely sure. Let me check the units and see.

Wait, entropy's in J/K, so let's think about the units. Let me think about the formula. I think the correct formula is ΔS = nR ln(V2/V1) but for solids, it's more accurate to use the formula ΔS = ∫(∂V/∂T)_P dP / P from P1 to P2. Oh wait, no, because for a solid under pressure, the change in volume with pressure and temperature can be related.

Wait, I'm getting mixed up. Let me think again. For an isothermal process, the entropy change for a solid can be calculated using the equation ΔS = ∫(1/T)(dQ) from P1 to P2, but since T is constant, it's ΔS = (1/T) ∫(∂U/∂V)_T dV from V1 to V2. But since the process is expansion, and for solids, the internal energy U might not change much with volume, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, I remember a formula that for small changes, the entropy change can be approximated by ΔS ≈ V α Δln(P), but I'm not certain. Wait, maybe it's ΔS = V α ln(P2/P1) or something like that. Let me think about this more carefully.

Wait, I think the correct formula is ΔS = -V α ln(P2/P1). Let me see: the coefficient of volume expansion α is (1/V)(∂V/∂T)_P, but here we're dealing with pressure changes at constant temperature. So perhaps the correct approach is to find dV in terms of dP, using the relation for solids under pressure.

Wait, for solids, the bulk modulus B is defined as B = -V (∂P/∂V)_T. But I don't have B here. Hmm. Alternatively, since α is given, maybe I can relate the change in volume with pressure using the given α.

Wait, another approach: for a solid, the change in volume with pressure can be expressed as dV = - (1/B) dP, but without knowing B, I can't proceed that way. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the relation between α and the volume change with pressure.

Wait, maybe I should express the entropy change using the given α. Let me think about the formula. Since the process is isothermal, the entropy change for a solid can be found using ΔS = ∫( (∂V/∂T)_P dP ) / P. But at constant temperature, (∂V/∂T)_P would be V α, since α = (1/V)(∂V/∂T)_P. So (∂V/∂T)_P = V α.

Wait, but since T is constant, (∂V/∂T)_P is zero, which doesn't help. Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the formula for entropy change when pressure changes at constant temperature is ΔS = ∫( (∂V/∂P)_T dP ) / T. But I'm not sure.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me try to recall the correct formula for entropy change for a solid during an isothermal process. I think the formula is:

ΔS = ∫(∂V/∂T)_P dP / P

But that doesn't seem right. Wait, perhaps it's:

ΔS = ∫( (∂V/∂P)_T ) dP / T

But I'm not sure. Let me think about the fundamental equation. The entropy change is given by:

dS = (∂S/∂V)_T dV + (∂S/∂P)_T dP

But for a process at constant T, it's better to express in terms of P and V. Alternatively, I can use the Maxwell relations. From dG = V dP - S dT, at constant T, dG = V dP. So integrating, G2 - G1 = ∫ V dP from P1 to P2.

But I'm not sure how that helps with entropy. Alternatively, from the Maxwell relation, (∂S/∂P)_T = - (∂V/∂T)_P. So S = ∫ (∂S/∂P)_T dP = - ∫ (∂V/∂T)_P dP.

But since (∂V/∂T)_P is V α, this becomes S = - ∫ V α dP from P1 to P2.

Wait, but V is a function of P, so this complicates things. Alternatively, maybe for small changes, we can approximate V as constant, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I can express V in terms of the initial pressure. Since the density d is given as 8.96e3 kg/m³, the molar volume V is molar mass / density. The molar mass of copper is about 63.55 g/mol, so 0.06355 kg/mol. So V = molar mass / density = 0.06355 / 8.96e3 ≈ 7.087e-6 m³/mol.

Wait, that's the molar volume at the initial pressure, I suppose. But as pressure changes, the volume will change slightly. But since the process is isothermal, and we have α, perhaps we can model the volume change as V = V0 (1 + α ΔT), but since T is constant, that term is zero. Hmm, that doesn't help.

Wait, I'm getting more confused. Let me try a different approach. For solids, the entropy change upon expansion can be approximated by ΔS ≈ -V α ln(P2/P1). Let me check if that makes sense dimensionally. α is in 1/K, V is in m³, so V α is m³/K. Multiply by ln(P2/P1), which is dimensionless, so ΔS would be in m³/K, which doesn't match J/K because J is N·m or Pa·m³. Wait, 1 Pa·m³ = 1 J. So V is in m³, and if I multiply by α which is 1/K, then V α is m³/K. But pressure is in Pa, so maybe I'm missing a factor involving pressure.

Wait, maybe the correct formula is ΔS = ∫ ( (∂V/∂T)_P ) dP / P. Since (∂V/∂T)_P is V α, then ΔS = ∫ (V α) dP / P. But V is a function of P, so this becomes complicated. Alternatively, perhaps we can approximate V as constant over the pressure range, which might be a reasonable assumption since the pressure change is from 200 atm to 1 atm, which is a factor of 200. But the volume change for solids under such pressure changes might be small, so maybe V can be approximated as roughly constant.

If I proceed with V ≈ constant, then ΔS ≈ V α ∫ (dP / P) from P1 to P2. The integral of dP/P is ln(P2/P1), so ΔS ≈ V α ln(P2/P1). But wait, since P decreases from 200 atm to 1 atm, ln(P2/P1) is negative, so ΔS would be negative, which makes sense because the system is expanding (doing work), so entropy increases. Wait, no, wait, in this case, the pressure is decreasing, so the system is expanding, which typically leads to an increase in entropy because the volume increases, leading to more possible microstates. So the formula should give a positive ΔS.

Wait, I'm getting myself confused again. Let's try plugging in the numbers. First, calculate V at initial pressure P1. As I did before, molar mass M = 63.55 g/mol = 0.06355 kg/mol. Density d = 8.96e3 kg/m³. So molar volume V0 = M / d = 0.06355 / 8.96e3 ≈ 7.087e-6 m³/mol.

Now, the pressure changes from P1 = 200 atm to P2 = 1 atm. The ratio P2/P1 is 1/200.

Assuming that the change in volume is small, we can approximate V ≈ V0 (1 - (P2 - P1)/(something)), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula:

ΔS = nR ln(V2/V1) + nC_v ln(T2/T1)

But since T is constant, the second term is zero, so ΔS = nR ln(V2/V1). But for solids, nR is much smaller than the thermal contributions, but maybe this isn't the right approach because the volume change isn't due to temperature but pressure.

Wait, but in the case of solids, the entropy change upon expansion is often modeled using the equation ΔS = -V α ln(P2/P1), but I'm not sure. Let me check the units again.

If I use ΔS = V α ln(P2/P1), then V is m³, α is 1/K, so units are m³/K. But 1 J = 1 Pa·m³, and 1 Pa = 1 N/m². So m³·Pa = N·m = J. So if I have V in m³ and multiply by α (1/K), I get (m³/K), which doesn't match J/K. Hmm, that's a problem. So maybe I'm missing a term involving pressure.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula includes the pressure. Let me think again. The entropy change for a process at constant T is given by:

ΔS = ∫( (∂V/∂P)_T ) dP

Because from the Maxwell relation, (∂S/∂P)_T = - (∂V/∂T)_P = -V α.

Wait, no, from Maxwell relations, (∂S/∂P)_T = - (∂V/∂T)_P. Since (∂V/∂T)_P = V α, then (∂S/∂P)_T = - V α.

So integrating from P1 to P2, ΔS = - V α ∫ dP from P1 to P2.

But that would give ΔS = - V α (P2 - P1). But that can't be right because if P decreases, then (P2-P1) is negative, so ΔS would be positive, which makes sense. Let me plug in the numbers.

V is approximately 7.087e-6 m³/mol. α is 1.66e-5 K^-1.

So ΔS = - V α (P2 - P1) = - (7.087e-6 m³/mol) * (1.66e-5 K^-1) * (1 atm - 200 atm).

Wait, but pressure units need to be in Pascals. 1 atm is about 101325 Pa. So P2 = 1 atm = 101325 Pa, P1 = 200 atm = 20265000 Pa.

So P2 - P1 = 101325 - 20265000 = -20163675 Pa.

So ΔS = - (7.087e-6) * (1.66e-5) * (-20163675)

Let me compute this step by step.

First, calculate the product inside: (7.087e-6) * (1.66e-5) = 7.087 * 1.66 * 1e-11 ≈ 11.77e-11 = 1.177e-10.

Then multiply by (-20163675):

1.177e-10 * (-2.0163675e7) ≈ -2.37e-3.

But since ΔS is -V α (P2 - P1), which is - (7.087e-6)(1.66e-5)(-20163675) = positive.

Wait, let's recalculate:

ΔS = - V α (P2 - P1) = - (7.087e-6 m³/mol) * (1.66e-5 K^-1) * (101325 - 20265000) Pa.

= - (7.087e-6)(1.66e-5) * (-20163675) J/K.

Because 1 Pa·m³ = 1 J, and V is in m³, so V * dP is in J.

Wait, no, because (∂V/∂P)_T dP is in m³, and dP is in Pa, so when you multiply them, it's m³·Pa = J. So the integral ∫(∂V/∂P)_T dP is in J, and then divided by T? Wait, no, I'm getting confused again.

Wait, no, the integral for entropy is ∫(∂V/∂P)_T dP from P1 to P2. Since (∂V/∂P)_T = - V α, as per Maxwell relations, then the integral becomes - V α (P2 - P1). So ΔS = - V α (P2 - P1).

But wait, the integral is ∫ (∂V/∂P)_T dP = ∫ (-V α) dP. If V is constant, then this is - V α (P2 - P1).

So ΔS = - V α (P2 - P1).

Plugging in the numbers:

V = 7.087e-6 m³/mol,

α = 1.66e-5 K^-1,

P2 = 1 atm = 101325 Pa,

P1 = 200 atm = 20265000 Pa,

So (P2 - P1) = 101325 - 20265000 = -20163675 Pa.

So ΔS = - (7.087e-6) * (1.66e-5) * (-20163675).

Let me compute this:

First, compute 7.087e-6 * 1.66e-5 = (7.087 * 1.66) * 1e-11 ≈ 11.77 * 1e-11 = 1.177e-10.

Then multiply by (-20163675):

1.177e-10 * (-2.0163675e7) ≈ -2.37e-3.

But since the integral is multiplied by -1, the total is:

ΔS = (-1) * [7.087e-6 * 1.66e-5 * (-20163675)] = (-1) * (-2.37e-3) = 2.37e-3 J/K.

Wait, that's approximately 2.37e-3 J/K. Looking at the options, option B is 2.33e-3 J/K, which is close. Let me check my calculations again to see if I made any approximation errors.

Wait, perhaps I should be more precise with the numbers.

Compute V = 0.06355 kg/mol / 8960 kg/m³ = 0.06355 / 8960 ≈ 7.093e-6 m³/mol.

Compute (P2 - P1) = 101325 - 200*101325 = 101325 - 20265000 = -20163675 Pa.

Then, compute V α (P2 - P1) = 7.093e-6 * 1.66e-5 * (-20163675).

Wait, let me compute step by step:

7.093e-6 * 1.66e-5 = (7.093 * 1.66) * 1e-11 ≈ 11.76 * 1e-11 = 1.176e-10.

Multiply by (-20163675):

1.176e-10 * (-2.0163675e7) = 1.176 * (-2.0163675) * 1e-3 ≈ -2.372 * 1e-3 = -0.002372 J/K.

But since ΔS is -V α (P2 - P1), then:

ΔS = - ( -0.002372 ) = 0.002372 J/K ≈ 2.37e-3 J/K.

Looking at the options, option B is 2.33e-3 J/K, which is very close. The slight discrepancy might be due to rounding during calculations. So I think the correct answer is option B.
</think>

To calculate the entropy change (ΔS) for the isothermal expansion of 1 mole of solid copper from 200.0 atm to 1.0 atm, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta S = -V \alpha (P_2 - P_1)
\]

### Given Data:
- **Initial pressure**: \( P_1 = 200.0 \, \text{atm} = 20265000 \, \text{Pa} \)
- **Final pressure**: \( P_2 = 1.0 \, \text{atm} = 101325 \, \text{Pa} \)
- **Coefficient of volume expansion**: \( \alpha = 1.66 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{K}^{-1} \)
- **Density**: \( d = 8.96 \times 10^3 \, \text{kg/m}^3 \)
- **Molar mass of copper**: \( M = 0.06355 \, \text{kg/mol} \)

### Step 1: Calculate the molar volume \( V \)
The molar volume \( V \) is given by:

\[
V = \frac{M}{d} = \frac{0.06355}{8.96 \times 10^3} \approx 7.093 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}^3/\text{mol}
\]

### Step 2: Compute \( P_2 - P_1 \)
\[
P_2 - P_1 = 101325 - 20265000 = -20163675 \, \text{Pa}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate \( \Delta S \)
Substitute the values into the formula:

\[
\Delta S = -V \alpha (P_2 - P_1)
\]

\[
\Delta S = -(7.093 \times 10^{-6}) (1.66 \times 10^{-5}) (-20163675)
\]

First, calculate the product of \( V \) and \( \alpha \):

\[
7.093 \times 10^{-6} \times 1.66 \times 10^{-5} = 1.176 \times 10^{-10}
\]

Then, multiply by \( (P_2 - P_1) \):

\[
1.176 \times 10^{-10} \times (-20163675) = -2.372 \times 10^{-3}
\]

Finally, apply the negative sign:

\[
\Delta S = -(-2.372 \times 10^{-3}) = 2.372 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{J/K}
\]

### Step 4: Match with the closest option
The calculated value \( 2.37 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{J/K} \) is closest to option **B: \( 2.33 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{J/K} \)**.

ANSWER: B
