The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

Statement 1 | For every positive integer n there is a cyclic group of order n. Statement 2 | Every finite cyclic group contains an element of every order that divides the order of the group.

Options:

A: Statement 1 is false because not all positive integers have a cyclic group. Statement 2 is true.
B: Statement 1 is false because only composite numbers have a cyclic group. Statement 2 is true.
C: False, False
D: True, False
E: False, True
F: Statement 1 is false because only prime numbers have a cyclic group. Statement 2 is true.
G: Statement 1 is true because all positive integers have a cyclic group. Statement 2 is false because only infinite cyclic groups contain an element of every order that divides the order of the group.
H: True, True
I: Both statements are true, but they are not related.
J: Statement 1 is true because all positive integers have a cyclic group. Statement 2 is false because not all finite cyclic groups contain an element of every order that divides the order of the group.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about group theory, specifically about cyclic groups. I'm a bit rusty on my group theory, but let me try to think this through step by step.

The question has two statements, Statement 1 and Statement 2, and I need to evaluate whether each is true or false. Then, based on their truth values, I'll pick the correct option from A to J.

Let me start by recalling what a cyclic group is. A cyclic group is a group that can be generated by a single element. This means every element in the group can be written as some power (or multiple, depending on the operation) of a particular element, which we call a generator.

Statement 1 says: "For every positive integer n, there is a cyclic group of order n." 

Hmm, so does every positive integer n have a cyclic group of order n? I remember that for finite cyclic groups, their order (which is the number of elements) can be any positive integer. For example, the integers modulo n under addition form a cyclic group of order n. So, for any n, like 5, 7, 100, etc., we can construct such a group. So, Statement 1 seems to be true because for each n, Z_n is a cyclic group of order n.

Wait, but is there any exception? Like, is there any positive integer where a cyclic group of that order doesn't exist? I don't think so. Because for any n, you can have Z_n, which is cyclic. So Statement 1 is True.

Now, moving on to Statement 2: "Every finite cyclic group contains an element of every order that divides the order of the group."

I remember Lagrange's theorem, which states that the order of any subgroup must divide the order of the group. So, in a finite cyclic group of order n, for each divisor d of n, there should be a subgroup of order d. Moreover, in a cyclic group, each such subgroup is cyclic and is generated by a single element of order d.

Wait, but the statement is about elements, not subgroups. So, in a cyclic group of order n, for each d dividing n, there exists an element of order d. Because each subgroup of order d is cyclic and has a generator of order d. So yes, every finite cyclic group has elements of every order that divides the group's order. Therefore, Statement 2 is also True.

Wait, but let me make sure. For example, take Z_6, which is cyclic of order 6. The divisors of 6 are 1, 2, 3, 6. Does it have elements of those orders? The element 1 has order 1, 2 has order 3 (since 2*3=6 ≡0 mod6), but wait, no, wait: in additive groups, the order of an element a is the smallest positive integer m such that m*a ≡0 mod6. So element 1: order 6. Element 2: 2*3=6≡0, so order 3. Element 3: 3*2=6≡0, so order 2. Element 4: same as element -2, so order 3. Element 5: same as -1, order 6. So yes, we have elements of orders 1,2,3,6. So Statement 2 holds.

Wait, but wait another example: Z_4. Divisors are 1,2,4. Element 1 has order 4, element 2 has order 2, element 3 has order 4. So yes, all divisors are covered.

So both statements are true. That would make the correct option H: True, True.

Wait, but let me check the options again to make sure. Option H is "True, True". So the answer should be H.

But let me double-check if I missed anything. Statement 1: For every n, a cyclic group of order n exists. Yes, because Z_n is cyclic of order n, and n can be any positive integer. So Statement 1 is True.

Statement 2: Every finite cyclic group has elements of every order dividing the group's order. As per the reasoning, yes, each such element exists as a generator of the corresponding subgroup. So Statement 2 is also True.

Therefore, both statements are true, so the correct answer is H.

The correct evaluation of the statements leads to both being true. 

Answer: H
