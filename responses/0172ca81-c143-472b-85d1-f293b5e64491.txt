Question:

A landlord was the owner of a two-story dwelling house and leased it completely furnished to a tenant for a 10-year period. Two years after the tenant entered into the leasehold agreement with the landlord, he subleases the house to his cousin. Thereafter, the cousin defaults on the rental payments. If the landlord brings an action to recover the past rent due from the cousin, the landlord will:

Options:

A: not recover, because privity of estate does not exist between the landlord and sublessee.
B: recover, because the landlord is the original owner of the house.
C: not recover, because the landlord did not approve the sublease agreement.
D: recover, because there is privity of contract between a landlord and sublessee.
E: not recover, because there is no privity of contract between the landlord and sublessee.
F: recover, because there is both privity of estate and privity of contract between a landlord and sublessee.
G: not recover, because the original tenant is responsible for the rent, not the sublessee.
H: recover, because there is privity of estate and privity of contract between the landlord and the original tenant.
I: recover, because the landlord has a right to payment from any tenant occupying the property.
J: recover, because pnvity of estate exists between a landlord and sublessee.

Okay, so I've got this question about landlord-tenant law, specifically dealing with subleasing. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The scenario is that a landlord owns a two-story house and leased it completely furnished to a tenant for 10 years. Two years into the lease, the tenant subleases the house to their cousin. Then, the cousin stops paying rent. The question is whether the landlord can recover the past due rent from the cousin.

Hmm, I remember that in property law, there's something about privity. Privity is important because it determines whether a party can sue or be sued. There are two types relevant here: privity of estate and privity of contract.

Privity of estate (or vertical privity) refers to the legal succession of an interest in property. It's about who has the right to the property. So, the original tenant has a leasehold estate from the landlord. When they sublease, does that create privity between the landlord and the sublessee (the cousin)?

Privity of contract, on the other hand, is horizontal privity. It's about the mutual promises made in a contract. So, the original lease between the landlord and tenant would have privity of contract, but does that extend to the sublessee?

I think the key here is whether the sublessee (cousin) is liable to the landlord directly. In a typical sublease situation, the sublessee only owes rent to the original tenant, not the landlord. The landlord's right is against the original tenant, not the subtenant. Unless the landlord has specifically approved the sublease and maybe even entered into a separate agreement with the sublessee, the sublessee isn't directly obligated to the landlord.

Wait, but the question is about the landlord suing the cousin for past rent. The options talk about privity of estate and contract. So, if there's no privity of estate between the landlord and the sublessee, the landlord can't recover from the sublessee. That's because privity of estate is necessary for the landlord to have a direct claim.

Looking at the options:

A: Not recover because no privity of estate. That sounds right because without vertical privity (landlord to sublessee), the landlord can't sue the sublessee.

B: Recover because landlord is the original owner. But ownership doesn't directly give the landlord a claim against the sublessee unless there's a contractual privity.

C: Not recover because didn't approve the sublease. Well, maybe, but I think approval isn't necessary for the sublease to be valid, unless the lease prohibits it. The question doesn't say the lease prohibited subleasing, so the tenant could sublease without approval. But whether the landlord can sue the sublessee is a separate issue.

D: Recover because privity of contract. But privity of contract is between the landlord and tenant, not the sublessee. The sublessee isn't a party to the original contract, so they don't have privity of contract with the landlord.

E: Not recover because no privity of contract. That's not correct because privity of contract isn't the issue here. The issue is privity of estate.

F: Recover because both privity of estate and contract exist. No, because privity of estate doesn't exist between landlord and sublessee.

G: Not recover because original tenant is responsible. That's correct in a way because the original tenant is the one who owes the rent, and if they sublease, the sublessee is liable to the tenant, not the landlord. So the landlord can't go after the sublessee unless there's a direct agreement.

H: Recover because privity exists with the original tenant. Wait, H says privity exists between landlord and original tenant, which is true, but the question is about suing the cousin. So, H is about the original tenant, not the sublessee.

I: Recover because any tenant is liable. No, because the sublessee isn't a party to the original lease. They are liable to the original tenant, not the landlord.

J: Recover because privity of estate exists. No, because privity of estate is between landlord and tenant, not the sublessee.

So, the correct answer seems to be either A or G. A says no privity of estate, so landlord can't recover. G says original tenant is responsible. Both are correct points, but the question is about suing the cousin.

Wait, the question is whether the landlord can recover from the cousin, so the issue is whether the cousin is liable. The landlord can't get from the cousin unless the cousin is a party to the lease, which they aren't. So, the landlord can't recover from the cousin because there's no privity of estate, meaning the cousin isn't in the chain of title. So A would be correct.

Alternatively, G says the original tenant is responsible. That's true, but the question is about the action against the cousin. So the landlord can't get from the cousin because of the lack of privity. So A is the correct answer.

The correct answer is A: not recover, because privity of estate does not exist between the landlord and sublessee.
