C: 0.4 molal
D: 0.2 molal
E: 0.1 molal
F: 0.5 molal
G: 0.25 molal
H: 0.15 molal
I: 0.3 molal
J: 0.35 molal

Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the molality of a solution made by adding 2.3 grams of ethanol to 500 grams of water. Hmm, I remember that molality is moles of solute per kilogram of solvent. Right, so I should start by finding the number of moles of ethanol.

The molecular weight of ethanol is given as 46 g/mol. So, I'll take the mass of ethanol, which is 2.3 grams, and divide that by 46 to get moles. Let me do that calculation: 2.3 divided by 46. Let's see, 46 times 0.05 is 2.3 because 46 times 0.05 is 2.3. Wait, no, wait: 46 times 0.05 is 2.3? Let me check: 46 * 0.05 = 2.3. Yes, that's correct. So the moles of ethanol are 0.05 mol.

Next, I need to find the mass of the solvent, which is water here. The problem states it's 500 grams of water. But molality uses kilograms, so I should convert that to kg. 500 grams is 0.5 kg.

Now, molality (m) is moles of solute divided by kg of solvent. So that's 0.05 mol divided by 0.5 kg. Let me calculate that: 0.05 / 0.5 equals 0.1. So the molality should be 0.1 molal.

Wait, looking at the options, option E is 0.1 molal. But let me double-check my steps. Did I convert grams to kg correctly? 500g is indeed 0.5 kg. And the moles were correct: 2.3g /46g/mol = 0.05 mol. Yeah, that's right. So the answer should be E.

The molality is calculated by dividing the moles of ethanol (0.05 mol) by the mass of water in kilograms (0.5 kg), resulting in 0.1 molal. 

Answer: E
