Okay, I'm trying to figure out which position the patient lies face down. The options are A to J, and I need to pick the correct one. Let me start by recalling each position.

First, I know that "prone" means lying face down. So that's probably D. But let me go through each option to make sure.

A: Supine – that's lying on the back, so face up. Not the one we're looking for.

B: Erect – that's standing upright, not lying down. So no.

C: Trendelenburg – I think this is when the patient is lying on their side with the legs elevated. It's used for certain surgical procedures, but not face down.

D: Prone – yes, lying face down. This seems correct.

E: Sims – this position is for lying on the side, with the legs bent. It's often used for examinations. So face not down.

F: Dorsal – that's the back, so supine position, same as A. Not face down.

G: Jackknife – I'm not too sure about this one. Maybe it's a position where the knees are bent towards the chest, like a fetal position. Could be face down, but I'm not certain.

H: Lateral – lying on the side, so the face is to the side, not down. So not the answer.

I: Semi-Fowler's – this is sitting up at an angle, maybe 30-45 degrees, so face forward, not down.

J: Lithotomy – this is the position where the patient is lying on their back with legs elevated, often used for pelvic exams. So face up, not down.

So, going back, D: Prone is definitely lying face down. Jackknife (G) might be another possible, but I think it's more about the knees being towards the chest, not necessarily face down. I'm pretty confident that D is the correct answer.
