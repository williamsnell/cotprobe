Okay, so I have this problem where I need to figure out how many more books Mills Library has compared to Springvale Library. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the numbers given are:
- Mills Library: 1,007,199 books
- Springvale Library: 907,082 books

I think the best way to approach this is to subtract the smaller number from the larger one to find the difference. That should give me the exact number of books Mills has more than Springvale.

Let me write that out:

1,007,199 (Mills)
- 907,082 (Springvale)
= ?

Hmm, doing the subtraction carefully:

Starting from the right:
9 - 2 = 7
9 - 8, wait, can't do that. So I need to borrow. Wait, maybe I should do this digit by digit.

Wait, maybe I can simplify it by rounding the numbers to make it easier for estimation since the question asks for the best estimate, not the exact number.

So, let's round each number to the nearest ten thousand or hundred thousand. Let's see:

Mills: 1,007,199. If I round this to the nearest hundred thousand, it would be 1,000,000 because 1,007,199 is just a bit over a million. Alternatively, to the nearest ten thousand, it's 1,010,000 because 7,199 is more than 5,000.

Springvale: 907,082. Rounding this to the nearest hundred thousand would be 900,000, but since it's 907,082, it's closer to 910,000 when rounded to the nearest ten thousand. Wait, 7,082 is more than 5,000, so yes, 910,000.

Wait, but maybe I should round both to the nearest hundred thousand for a rough estimate. So Mills would be 1,000,000 and Springvale would be 900,000. Then the difference would be 1,000,000 - 900,000 = 100,000. But looking at the options, option G is 100,000, but I think the exact difference is more than that, so maybe I should be more precise.

Alternatively, let me try subtracting the exact numbers.

1,007,199 - 907,082.

Let me line them up:

1,007,199
-  907,082
------------
Starting from the right:
9 - 2 =7
9 - 8: Can't do that, so borrow. The next digit is 1, which becomes 0, and the 9 becomes 19. 19-8=11? Wait, no, 19-8 is 11? Wait, no, 19-8 is 11? Wait, no, 19-8 is 11? No, wait, 19-8 is 11? No, that's not right. Wait, 19-8 is 11? No, wait, 19-8 is 11? No, that's not right. Wait, 19-8 is 11? No, because 8+11=19. So the units place is 11? Wait, no, in subtraction, you can't have 11. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me try another approach.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to subtract 907,082 from 1,007,199.

Let me do it step by step:

1,007,199 minus 900,000 is 107,199.
Then subtract the remaining 7,082: 107,199 -7,082.

Hmm, 107,199 -7,000 is 100,199.
Then subtract 82 more: 100,199 -82 = 100,117.

Wait, that can't be right because 1007199 minus 907082 should be more than 100,000. Let me check my math again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the subtraction steps. Let me try another way.

Let me write it down:

1,007,199
- 907,082
= ?

Let me subtract each digit:

Starting from the right (units place):
9 - 2 =7
Next digit (tens place): 9 -8. Since 9 is less than 8, I need to borrow from the next higher digit.
So, the hundreds place: 1 becomes 0, and the tens place becomes 19 (since we're borrowing from the thousands place). So 19-8=11. Wait, that's not right because 19-8 is 11, but in subtraction, we can't have 11 in a single digit. So perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me do it more carefully.

Alternatively, let's subtract 907,082 from 1,007,199.

Let me break it down:

1,007,199 = 1,000,000 + 7,199
907,082 = 900,000 + 7,082

So subtracting:
(1,000,000 - 900,000) = 100,000
(7,199 -7,082) = 117

So total difference is 100,000 + 117 = 100,117.

Wait, that seems off because when I add 100,000 and 117, I get 100,117, which is 100 thousand and 117. But looking at the options, the closest is G:100,000, which is option G. But wait, let me check again because I think I might have made a mistake in the initial subtraction.

Wait, another way: 907,082 + 100,000 = 1,007,082. Then, Mills has 1,007,199, which is 1,007,199 - 1,007,082 = 117 more. So total difference is 100,000 + 117 = 100,117.

So the exact difference is 100,117 books. Now, looking at the options:

A: 200,000
B: 20,000
C:120,000
D:10,000
E:70,000
F:90,000
G:100,000
H:50,000
I:8,000
J:80,000

So the closest estimate is G:100,000. But wait, the exact number is 100,117, which is just a bit over 100k, so 100,000 is the best estimate. Alternatively, maybe the options expect rounding to the nearest ten thousand, in which case 100,117 would round to 100,000.

Wait, but let me think again. The question says "best estimate," so perhaps I should have rounded the original numbers before subtracting. Let's try that.

Mills: 1,007,199. Rounded to the nearest hundred thousand is 1,000,000. Springvale: 907,082 rounds to 900,000. So 1,000,000 -900,000=100,000. So that's option G.

Alternatively, if I round to the nearest ten thousand:

Mills: 1,007,199 rounds to 1,010,000 (since 7,199 is more than 5,000)
Springvale: 907,082 rounds to 910,000 (since 7,082 is more than 5,000)
Then 1,010,000 -910,000=100,000. So again, G.

But wait, the exact difference is 100,117, which is very close to 100,000, so G is the best estimate.

Alternatively, perhaps I should check if any other option is closer. Let's see: The exact difference is 100,117. The options are A:200k (too high), B:20k (too low), C:120k (10k over), D:10k (90k under), E:70k (30k under), F:90k (10k under), G:100k (117 over), H:50k (50k under), I:8k (way too low), J:80k (20k under). So G is the closest, only 117 over, which is the smallest difference compared to other options. So the answer should be G.

The Mills Library has 1,007,199 books, and the Springvale Library has 907,082 books. To find how many more books Mills has, subtract 907,082 from 1,007,199, which equals 100,117 books. Rounding this to the nearest hundred thousand gives 100,000. Among the options, G: 100,000 is the best estimate.

Answer: G
