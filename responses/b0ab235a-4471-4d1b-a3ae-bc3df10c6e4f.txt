Question:

Three hundred college freshmen are observed to have grad point averages that are approximately normally distributed with mean 2.1 and a standard deviation of 1.2. How many of these freshmen would you expect to have grade point averages between 2.5 and 3.5 if the averages are recorded to the nearest tenth?

Options:

A: 103 students
B: 50 students
C: 90 students
D: 110 students
E: 82 students
F: 95 students
G: 120 students
H: 75 students
I: 68 students
J: 57 students

Okay, so I've got this statistics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me see... The question is about college freshmen's GPA, which is normally distributed with a mean of 2.1 and a standard deviation of 1.2. We need to find how many out of 300 students have GPA between 2.5 and 3.5, recorded to the nearest tenth.

Hmm, first, I remember that in a normal distribution, we can use Z-scores to find probabilities. So, the plan is to calculate the Z-scores for 2.5 and 3.5, then find the area between those Z-scores, and multiply that by 300 to get the expected number of students.

Wait, but the GPA is recorded to the nearest tenth. Does that affect anything? Oh right, when data is rounded, it can create a small interval around each possible tenth value. So, when calculating probabilities for 2.5, it's actually the interval from 2.45 to 2.55, and similarly for 3.5, it's from 3.45 to 3.55. Because the GPA is recorded as .1 increments, the true value could be just below or above that tenth.

So, I need to adjust the boundaries by half a tenth on each side. That makes sense because, for example, a GPA of 2.5 could be anything from 2.45 up to 2.55 when considering the nearest tenth.

Let me write down the adjusted values:

- Lower bound for 2.5: 2.5 - 0.05 = 2.45
- Upper bound for 3.5: 3.5 + 0.05 = 3.55

Now, I'll calculate the Z-scores for these adjusted values.

The formula for Z-score is (X - μ) / σ, where μ is the mean and σ is the standard deviation.

Calculating Z for 2.45:
Z1 = (2.45 - 2.1) / 1.2 = (0.35) / 1.2 ≈ 0.2917

Calculating Z for 3.55:
Z2 = (3.55 - 2.1) / 1.2 = (1.45) / 1.2 ≈ 1.2083

Next, I need to find the probability that a Z-score falls between 0.2917 and 1.2083. To do this, I'll look up each Z-score in the standard normal distribution table or use a calculator to find the cumulative probabilities.

Looking up Z1 = 0.29:
The cumulative probability is about 0.6141.

Looking up Z2 = 1.21:
The cumulative probability is about 0.8869.

Wait, let me make sure I'm getting the right values. For Z=0.29, the table says approximately 0.6141, and for Z=1.21, it's approximately 0.8869. So the area between Z1 and Z2 is 0.8869 - 0.6141 = 0.2728.

So, the probability is about 27.28%. Now, to find the number of students, multiply this by 300.

Calculating 27.28% of 300: 0.2728 * 300 ≈ 81.84 students. Hmm, that's roughly 82 students.

Looking at the options, E is 82 students. But wait, did I make any mistakes in the calculations?

Wait, let me double-check the Z-scores. For 2.45: 2.45-2.1=0.35, divided by 1.2 is 0.2917, correct. For 3.55: 3.55-2.1=1.45, divided by 1.2 is 1.2083, correct.

Probability between Z=0.29 and Z=1.21: 0.8869 - 0.6141 = 0.2728, which is 27.28%, so 0.2728 *300≈81.84. Yeah, that's about 82.

So the answer should be E: 82 students.

The problem involves calculating the expected number of college freshmen with GPA between 2.5 and 3.5, given a normal distribution with mean 2.1 and standard deviation 1.2. Adjusting for rounding to the nearest tenth, the boundaries are expanded to 2.45 and 3.55. Z-scores for these values are 0.2917 and 1.2083, respectively. Using the standard normal distribution, the probability between these Z-scores is approximately 27.28%, leading to an expected 82 students out of 300.
