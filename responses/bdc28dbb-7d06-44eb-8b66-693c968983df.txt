Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about a knee injury in a 19-year-old guy who was hit from behind below the right knee while playing football. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the patient presents with a lack of fluid motion in his gait. That makes me think he's limping or moving awkwardly because of pain or structural issues. Standing flexion test is negative, so that probably rules out some ligament issues because a positive test might indicate a problem. Cruciate and collateral ligaments are intact, so that's good because it means the main ligaments in the knee are okay. But then they mention foot drop on the right. Foot drop is a condition where the foot can't be lifted properly, which usually affects dorsiflexion. That makes me think about nerve issues, maybe a peroneal nerve injury.

Wait, the injury was below the right knee. So maybe it's not just a ligament injury. If the ligaments are okay, what else could it be? A stress fracture? But a tibial stress fracture would typically present with pain on weight-bearing, maybe more in the shin area. The standing flexion test being negative might not directly point to that.

Foot drop often relates to the common peroneal nerve, which runs along the fibular neck. If there's a blow to the area below the knee, could that cause a nerve injury? Like a stretch or a tear of the peroneal nerve? That would explain the foot drop because the nerve supplies the muscles involved in dorsiflexion, like the tibialis anterior.

Looking at the options, let's go through them one by one.

A: Meniscus tear. Usually causes pain, swelling, and may lead to locking or popping. But the ligaments are intact, and standing flexion is negative. Also, doesn't directly explain foot drop.

B: Tibial stress fracture. Possible, but how does that tie into foot drop? Maybe if the injury is causing altered gait leading to overuse elsewhere, but the foot drop is more direct.

C: Posterior cruciate ligament tear. That's when the PCL is torn, often from a blow to the knee from above, like getting hit while the knee is bent. But the question says the hit was below the knee, so maybe less likely. Also, symptoms would include instability but not necessarily foot drop.

D: Unilateral sacral shear. That's a pelvic injury, could cause lower back pain and maybe some nerve issues, but the foot drop is unilateral on the right, so maybe, but I'm not sure.

E: Patellar dislocation. Causes pain and instability around the knee, but again, doesn't directly explain foot drop.

F: Medial collateral ligament sprain. That's a common injury, but ligaments are intact, so probably not.

G: Posteriorly deviated fibular head. Hmm, the fibula is next to the tibia. If the fibular head is deviated posteriorly, could that press on the peroneal nerve? That might cause compression or injury, leading to foot drop. I've heard of this being a cause of foot drop, especially in cases where there's a blow or injury to the fibular area.

H: Anterior cruciate ligament tear. Typically from a twist or pivot injury, but again, the foot drop is more concerning.

I: Plantar flexed cuboid. That's a foot bone issue, maybe causing plantar fasciitis or something, but not directly linked to the knee injury described.

J: Anteriorly deviated distal femur. That sounds like a skeletal malalignment, which could cause various issues, but again, not directly explaining the foot drop.

So, putting it all together: the key points are foot drop, hit below the knee, ligaments intact. The most likely cause is a peroneal nerve injury. Now, how does that happen? If the fibular head is deviated posteriorly, it might compress the nerve. So option G is posteriorly deviated fibular head. That would make sense because the fibula is near the peroneal nerve, and a blow could cause it to move, pinching the nerve and causing foot drop.

Another thought: sometimes in football, a direct blow can cause a fibular head to shift, leading to compression of the peroneal nerve. This is sometimes referred to as a "fibular head compression syndrome" or "lateral knee pain" due to nerve entrapment.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is G: posteriorly deviated fibular head.

The patient presents with a history of being hit from behind below the right knee, resulting in a lack of fluid motion during gait and foot drop. The standing flexion test is negative, and the cruciate and collateral ligaments appear intact, ruling out ligament injuries. Foot drop suggests a possible nerve injury, specifically involving the peroneal nerve, which runs near the fibular head. A posteriorly deviated fibular head could compress the peroneal nerve, leading to foot drop. Among the options, G: posteriorly deviated fibular head best explains the symptoms and mechanism of injury.

Answer: G
