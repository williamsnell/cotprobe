Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty on some concepts, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me see what the question is asking.

The problem says that at 1308 K, 1 mole of ruthenium changes from the beta solid state to the alpha solid state. The enthalpy change (ΔH) for this transition is -34 calories per mole. I need to calculate the entropy change of the surroundings, given that the surrounding cooling bath is at STP conditions. The options are A through D, each with a specific value in J/K.

Hmm, wait, STP is standard temperature and pressure, which is usually 25°C (298 K) and 1 atm. But in this case, the transition happens at 1308 K, so the surroundings are at a higher temperature than STP. Or wait, no, the problem says the surrounding cooling bath is at STP. Wait, that might be a point of confusion. Because the transition occurs at 1308 K, but the surroundings are at STP (298 K), which is much lower. So the system is at a higher temperature than the surroundings. 

Wait, but wait, the process is solid to solid transition. So the ruthenium is changing phase from beta to alpha solid. So it's a solid-solid phase transition, which occurs at a specific temperature here, 1308 K. The system is the ruthenium undergoing this phase change, and the surroundings are the cooling bath at STP.

The question is about the entropy change of the surroundings, ΔS_surr. 

I remember that for entropy change of the surroundings, especially when heat is exchanged with the surroundings, we use the formula ΔS_surr = -Q_rev / T_surr, where Q_rev is the heat absorbed by the system in a reversible process. But wait, the process here is the phase transition of ruthenium, which is at constant temperature and pressure, so it's a phase change, so it's a reversible process. 

Wait, but the phase change occurs at 1308 K, but the surroundings are at 298 K (STP). So how does heat flow? If the transition is exothermic (ΔH is negative, -34 cal/mol), that means the system is releasing heat to the surroundings. Because when a system undergoes a phase change and releases heat, the surroundings gain that heat.

Wait, ΔH is the enthalpy change of the system. So if ΔH is negative, the system is losing heat. So the heat Q for the system is negative, which means the surroundings gain Q positive.

So for the system, Q = ΔH = -34 cal/mol. But for the surroundings, Q would be +34 cal/mol. But wait, entropy change for the surroundings is calculated using the heat they exchange at their temperature, which is T_surr = 298 K.

But wait, the transition occurs at 1308 K, so the heat transfer might not be at 298 K. Wait, no. Because the process is happening in a cooling bath at STP, which is 298 K. So the heat is being transferred from the system (at 1308 K) to the surroundings (at 298 K). So the heat Q released by the system is transferred to the surroundings, and the surroundings' temperature is 298 K.

Wait, but the process is a phase transition. The system is at 1308 K, and the surroundings are at 298 K. So the heat released by the system is Q = -34 cal/mol, and the surroundings receive this amount. So the entropy change for the surroundings would be Q_surr / T_surr.

But wait, the system's temperature is higher than the surroundings, so the heat flows from the system to the surroundings. So the surroundings receive heat, which is positive for the surroundings. So Q_surr = +34 cal/mol.

But wait, ΔS_surr = Q_surr_rev / T_surr. So that would be (34 cal) / 298 K. But wait, the units here are in calories, and the options are in joules. So I need to convert cal to joules. 1 cal is approximately 4.184 J.

So let me calculate that. 

First, convert ΔH from cal/mol to J/mol. ΔH = -34 cal/mol = -34 * 4.184 J/mol ≈ -142.256 J/mol.

But since the surroundings are receiving heat, Q_surr is +34 cal/mol → 34 * 4.184 ≈ 142.256 J/mol.

Now, T_surr is 298 K (STP). So ΔS_surr = Q_surr / T_surr = (142.256 J) / 298 K ≈ 0.477 J/K.

Wait, but that's not matching any of the options. The options are around 0.25 to 0.41. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the process is happening at the transition temperature, 1308 K. So maybe the heat transfer is at that temperature, not at the surroundings' temperature. Wait, no, because the surroundings are at STP. So when a system at higher temperature (1308 K) transfers heat to the surroundings at lower temperature (298 K), the heat is exchanged at the surroundings' temperature for the entropy calculation.

Wait, but in reality, the heat transfer would involve the system cooling down and the surroundings heating up, but in this case, it's a phase transition, so the system's temperature remains at 1308 K during the transition. So the heat is released by the system at 1308 K, but the surroundings are at 298 K. So the heat flow is from system to surroundings, so the surroundings receive heat at 298 K.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Because the entropy change of the surroundings depends on the heat they receive, which is at their own temperature. So the formula would be ΔS_surr = Q_surr / T_surr, where Q_surr is the heat gained by the surroundings. 

But in this case, since the system is releasing heat, Q_surr is positive, and it's equal to -ΔH, because ΔH is the enthalpy change of the system. Wait, no, ΔH is the enthalpy change of the system, which is the heat at constant pressure. But since the system is releasing heat, Q for the system is negative, so Q_surr is positive.

So, Q_surr = -ΔH = 34 cal/mol. But wait, ΔH is given as -34 cal/mol, so Q_surr is +34 cal/mol.

So the entropy change is 34 cal * (4.184 J/cal) / 298 K.

Wait, 34 cal is 34 * 4.184 J ≈ 142.256 J.

So 142.256 J / 298 K ≈ 0.477 J/K.

Hmm, but the options don't have 0.477. The closest is option C: 0.41 J/K, but that's lower. Did I make a mistake in the approach?

Wait, another thought: perhaps the process is considered as a reversible process at the transition temperature, so the heat transfer is at 1308 K, not at STP. But that doesn't make sense because the surroundings are at STP.

Wait, let me think again. The system is at 1308 K, and the surroundings are at 298 K. The system undergoes a phase change, releasing heat. The heat released by the system is Q = ΔH = -34 cal/mol. So the surroundings receive +34 cal/mol.

The entropy change of the surroundings would be Q_surr / T_surr, which is (34 cal) * 4.184 J/cal / 298 K.

Wait, 34 *4.184 = let me calculate that again: 34 *4 is 136, 34*0.184=6.256, so total 142.256 J. 142.256 / 298 is approximately 0.477 J/K.

But none of the options match that. So perhaps I'm approaching this incorrectly.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the problem is asking for the total entropy change of the universe, but no, the question specifies the surroundings. Alternatively, maybe I should consider whether the process is reversible or not.

Wait, the process is a phase transition at constant temperature and pressure, so it's a reversible process. Therefore, the entropy change of the system is ΔS_sys = ΔH_sys / T_trans, where T_trans is 1308 K.

But the question is about the surroundings, not the system. So for the surroundings, the entropy change is Q_surr / T_surr.

Wait, but the system's entropy change is ΔS_sys = ΔH_sys / T_trans.

But the total entropy change of the universe is ΔS_univ = ΔS_sys + ΔS_surr.

But the question only asks for the surroundings' entropy change. So I think I was correct earlier, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, alternative approach: Maybe the heat transfer occurs at the temperature of the transition, i.e., 1308 K. But that doesn't make sense because the surroundings are at 298 K. Unless the process is considered as occurring reversibly at 1308 K, but that's the system's temperature.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the process is isothermal at the transition temperature, so the heat Q is at 1308 K, but the surroundings are at 298 K, so the heat is transferred from system to surroundings. But in that case, the entropy change of the surroundings would be Q_surr / T_surr, where Q_surr is the heat they receive.

Wait, but if the system releases heat Q = 34 cal/mol (since ΔH is negative), then the surroundings receive +34 cal/mol. So Q_surr = +34 cal/mol = 142.256 J/mol.

So ΔS_surr = 142.256 J / 298 K ≈ 0.477 J/K.

But none of the options match this. The options are A:0.34, B:0.29, C:0.41, D:0.25.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the sign. Let me think: since the system is losing heat, the surroundings are gaining heat. So for the surroundings, Q is positive, so entropy increases. So the calculation is correct, but the options don't have this value.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the heat is transferred at the system's temperature, so T = 1308 K. But that would give ΔS_surr = 34 cal/(1308 K) in cal/K, then converted to J/K.

Let me try that approach. So Q_surr = 34 cal = 142.256 J. T_surr = 1308 K.

Then ΔS_surr = 142.256 J / 1308 K ≈ 0.1088 J/K ≈ 0.11 J/K. That's even lower and not matching the options.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something else. Let me think about the formula again. The entropy change of the surroundings is the negative of the entropy change of the system if the process is reversible. Wait, no. The total entropy change is ΔS_univ = ΔS_sys + ΔS_surr, and for a reversible process, ΔS_univ = 0.

Wait, for a reversible process at T, the system's entropy change is ΔS_sys = ΔH / T. So ΔS_sys = (-34 cal/mol) / (1308 K) = (-34 *4.184 J) / 1308 K ≈ (-142.256 J) / 1308 K ≈ -0.1088 J/K.

Then, since ΔS_univ = 0 for reversible, ΔS_surr = +0.1088 J/K ≈ 0.109 J/K. But that's not matching the options either.

Wait, but the problem states that the cooling bath is at STP, so the process is happening with heat exchange at 298 K, not at the transition temperature. So perhaps the earlier approach is correct, but the options don't match, which suggests I might have made a mistake.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is considering the heat released by the system at its own temperature, so the entropy change of the surroundings is -Q / T_surr, but I might have a sign error.

Wait, the system is losing heat (Q = -34 cal), so the surroundings gain +34 cal. So ΔS_surr = +34 cal * 4.184 J/cal / 298 K ≈ 0.477 J/K. But that's not an option. So perhaps I'm missing a negative sign somewhere.

Wait, no, the problem is about the entropy change of the surroundings. If the surroundings receive heat, their entropy increases. So ΔS_surr is positive. But the options are all positive numbers, so that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the entropy change of the surroundings in the opposite direction, i.e., the entropy lost by the surroundings. But no, the problem states the surroundings are cooling the system, so they are losing heat, but wait, no, the system is releasing heat, so the surroundings are gaining heat.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me restate the problem:

- System: 1 mole of Ru undergoes phase change from beta to alpha, releasing heat (ΔH = -34 cal/mol).

- Surroundings: Cooling bath at STP (298 K) absorbs this heat.

So surroundings' entropy change is + (heat received) / T.

Heat received by surroundings: 34 cal = 142.256 J.

So ΔS_surr = 142.256 J / 298 K ≈ 0.477 J/K.

But the options don't have this value. So maybe the problem is considering the process in reverse, or perhaps it's a typo in the options. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the problem is asking for the entropy change of the surroundings when the system undergoes the transition, considering that the heat is exchanged at the system's temperature (1308 K). So ΔS_surr = -Q / T_surr_system.

Wait, that would be ΔS_surr = (-34 cal) * 4.184 J/cal / 1308 K ≈ (-142.256 J) / 1308 K ≈ -0.1088 J/K. But that's the entropy change of the system, not the surroundings.

Alternatively, perhaps the entropy change of the surroundings is calculated using the heat released at the system's temperature. So Q = 34 cal, T = 1308 K.

So ΔS_surr = 34 cal *4.184 J/cal / 1308 K ≈ 142.256 J / 1308 K ≈ 0.1088 J/K ≈ 0.11 J/K. Still not matching the options.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me check the options again. The options are A:0.34, B:0.29, C:0.41, D:0.25, all in J/K.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the heat is transferred at the system's transition temperature, but I should calculate the entropy change as the negative of the system's entropy change.

Wait, the system's entropy change is ΔS_sys = ΔH / T = (-34 cal/mol) / (1308 K) = (-34 *4.184 J) / 1308 K ≈ (-142.256 J) / 1308 K ≈ -0.1088 J/K.

Then, the surroundings' entropy change would be the negative of that, because for a reversible process, ΔS_univ = 0. So ΔS_surr = +0.1088 J/K ≈ 0.11 J/K, which still doesn't match the options.

Wait, but the options are higher. So perhaps I'm missing a factor. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the entropy change of the surroundings in a different way. Let me think: the system releases heat Q at its temperature T_system =1308 K, and the surroundings absorb this heat at their temperature T_surroundings =298 K.

So the entropy change of the surroundings would be Q / T_surroundings.

So Q = 34 cal =142.256 J.

So ΔS_surr = 142.256 J / 298 K ≈ 0.477 J/K.

But again, the options don't have this. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in the approach.

Wait, another angle: Maybe the problem is considering the entropy change due to the phase transition, which is at 1308 K, but the surroundings are at STP. So the total entropy change is the sum of the system's and surroundings'.

Wait, but the question is only about the surroundings, not the total.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is in the sign. Since the system is losing heat, the surroundings are gaining it, so the entropy change is positive.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the absolute value. Let me see: 142.256 J / 298 K ≈ 0.477 J/K. None of the options match, but option C is 0.41 J/K, which is close but not exact.

Wait, perhaps I should recalculate the conversion from cal to J more accurately. 34 cal *4.184 J/cal = let's calculate that precisely.

34 *4 =136, 34 *0.184=6.256. So total 136 +6.256=142.256 J.

Yes, that's correct.

Hmm, maybe the problem expects the answer in cal/(K), but the options are in J/(K). Let me see:

34 cal = 34 cal. T_surr =298 K.

So ΔS_surr = 34 cal / 298 K ≈ 0.114 cal/K.

Convert to J/K: 0.114 cal/K *4.184 J/cal ≈ 0.477 J/K. Same as before.

I'm stuck. The calculation keeps leading me to approximately 0.477 J/K, but the options don't have that. Maybe the problem expects the surroundings' entropy change to be negative because the surroundings are losing heat? No, that can't be right because the system is releasing heat, so the surroundings are gaining it.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. The transition is from beta to alpha, which is exothermic, so the system releases heat. The surroundings, being at a lower temperature, receive this heat. So the surroundings' entropy increases.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the surroundings are cooling the system, so the surroundings are losing heat. But no, that's not correct. The system is at higher temperature, so it's releasing heat to the surroundings.

Wait, perhaps the problem is in the sign. The entropy change of the surroundings is positive, but the options are all positive, so that's correct.

Wait, maybe the problem is that I should use the system's temperature for the surroundings' entropy change. But that would be incorrect because the surroundings are at a different temperature.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula for entropy change as ΔS = -ΔH / T, but that would be for the surroundings if the heat is absorbed at a different temperature.

Wait, let me think: The system's ΔS is ΔH / T_system. The surroundings' ΔS is -Q / T_surroundings. Since Q for the system is ΔH = -34 cal, then Q for the surroundings is +34 cal. So ΔS_surr = 34 cal *4.184 J/cal / 298 K ≈ 0.477 J/K.

But again, no matching option.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the transition occurs at 1308 K, but the heat is exchanged at STP. So the heat released by the system is Q = ΔH = -34 cal, so the surroundings receive +34 cal. So the entropy change is Q_surr / T_surr = 34 cal *4.184 J/cal / 298 K ≈ 0.477 J/K.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but the closest option is C:0.41 J/K.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Maybe the problem is considering that the heat is transferred at the system's temperature, so the entropy change is ΔS_surr = -Q / T_surr. But that would be:

Q =34 cal =142.256 J.

ΔS_surr = 142.256 J / 298 K ≈0.477 J/K.

No, that's the same as before.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula ΔS = -ΔH / T, where T is the temperature of the surroundings. So ΔS_surr = -(-34 cal/mol) / 298 K =34 cal/(298 K) ≈0.114 cal/K =0.477 J/K.

Hmm, I'm going in circles. Given that none of the options match my calculation, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Let me try to think differently.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the entropy change of the surroundings is the negative of the system's entropy change, assuming a reversible process at T=1308 K. So ΔS_sys = ΔH / T = (-34 cal/mol) / 1308 K.

Converting to J: (-34 *4.184) ≈-142.256 J. So ΔS_sys = -142.256 J /1308 K ≈-0.1088 J/K.

Then, ΔS_surr = +0.1088 J/K ≈0.109 J/K.

But that's not matching any options either.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the process is happening at the system's temperature, so the surroundings' entropy change is ΔS_surr = -ΔH / T_surr.

Wait, but that would be ΔS_surr = -(-34 cal) / 298 K =34/298 ≈0.114 cal/K =0.477 J/K.

Same result as before.

I'm really stuck here. Maybe I should look for an alternative approach. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula ΔS = Q / T, where Q is the heat at the surroundings' temperature.

Wait, perhaps the problem is simply asking for ΔS_surr = -ΔH / T_surr, but that's not correct because ΔH is the system's enthalpy change, and Q_surr is +ΔH if the system releases heat.

Wait, no, ΔH = Q_p (heat at constant pressure), but the process here is a solid-solid transition, so perhaps it's at constant pressure, making ΔH = Q.

So Q_surr = -ΔH = 34 cal.

So ΔS_surr = 34 cal *4.184 J/cal /298 K ≈0.477 J/K.

But again, no matching option.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the answer in cal/(K), not J/(K). Let's see:

34 cal / 298 K ≈0.114 cal/K. Which is about 0.114 *4.184 ≈0.477 J/K.

No, same result.

Wait, maybe the problem is using the system's temperature for the surroundings' entropy change. So ΔS_surr = -ΔH / T_system.

ΔH =-34 cal, so ΔS_surr =34 cal /1308 K ≈0.026 cal/K =0.026 *4.184 ≈0.1088 J/K.

Still not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the transition is endothermic for the surroundings. But no, the system is exothermic, so the surroundings receive heat.

I'm really stuck. The calculation keeps leading me to approximately 0.477 J/K, but the options don't have that. Perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but the closest is option C:0.41 J/K. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the problem is considering the process as happening in two steps: cooling the system from 1308 K to 298 K, and then the phase transition. But that's not stated in the problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the entropy change of the surroundings is the negative of the system's entropy change. So if the system's entropy change is ΔS_sys = ΔH / T = (-34 cal) / 1308 K ≈-0.026 cal/K =-0.1088 J/K, then the surroundings' entropy change would be +0.1088 J/K ≈0.109 J/K. But that's not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the unit conversions. Let me do that again.

ΔH = -34 cal/mol. Converting to J: 34 *4.184 =142.256 J. So Q_surr =+142.256 J.

T_surr =298 K.

ΔS_surr =142.256 J /298 K = approximately 0.477 J/K.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the answer rounded to two decimal places. 0.477 is approximately 0.48 J/K, but that's still not an option.

Wait, looking at the options again:

A:0.34, B:0.29, C:0.41, D:0.25.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Maybe the process is endothermic for the surroundings, so the surroundings lose heat, leading to a negative entropy change. But that would imply the surroundings' entropy decreases, which would mean the system is absorbing heat from the surroundings, which would be the case if the transition were endothermic. But in this case, the transition is exothermic (ΔH negative), so the system releases heat to the surroundings, which gain heat and thus have positive entropy change.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the entropy change of the surroundings as negative, but that doesn't make sense because the surroundings are gaining heat.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula ΔS = -ΔH / T, but that would give ΔS_surr = -(-34 cal) / 1308 K ≈0.026 cal/K ≈0.1088 J/K, which is still not matching.

I'm really stuck. Maybe I should consider that the problem expects the answer to be approximately 0.48 J/K, but since it's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the heat is transferred at the system's temperature, so the entropy change is ΔS_surr = -ΔH / T_surr.

Wait, ΔH is -34 cal, so -ΔH is 34 cal. So 34 cal *4.184 J/cal =142.256 J.

T_surr =298 K.

So ΔS_surr =142.256 J /298 K ≈0.477 J/K.

Same as before.

I think I've exhausted all possibilities. The correct calculation leads to approximately 0.477 J/K, which isn't among the options. However, the closest option is C:0.41 J/K. But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, maybe I should recalculate 142.256 divided by 298.

Let me do that division more accurately.

142.256 /298 ≈?

Well, 298 *0.477 = 298 *0.4=119.2; 298 *0.077≈22.966. So 119.2+22.966≈142.166, which is close to 142.256. So yes, 0.477 J/K.

But since that's not an option, perhaps the problem expects the answer to be approximately 0.48 J/K, but the options don't have it. Alternatively, perhaps the problem has a typo, or I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps the cooling bath is at STP, but the process occurs at 1308 K, so the heat released by the system is at 1308 K, but the surroundings are at 298 K. So the heat transfer is from 1308 K to 298 K, and the entropy change of the surroundings is calculated based on the heat they receive at 298 K.

So, Q_surr =34 cal =142.256 J.

ΔS_surr =142.256 J /298 K ≈0.477 J/K.

But again, no matching option.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the entropy change of the surroundings as the negative of the system's entropy change. The system's entropy change is ΔS_sys =ΔH / T = (-34 cal) / 1308 K ≈-0.026 cal/K ≈-0.1088 J/K.

So ΔS_surr = +0.1088 J/K ≈0.109 J/K.

But that's not matching any options either.

I'm really stuck. I think the correct answer based on the calculation is approximately 0.477 J/K, but since that's not an option, I might have to choose the closest one, which is C:0.41 J/K. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach, and the correct answer is B:0.29 J/K.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the initial assumption. The problem says the system is at 1308 K, and the surroundings are at STP (298 K). The transition releases heat, so the surroundings gain heat, leading to positive entropy change.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula ΔS = -ΔH / T, where T is the temperature at which the heat is exchanged. So if the heat is exchanged at the surroundings' temperature, T=298 K, then ΔS_surr = -(-34 cal) /298 K =34 cal/298 K ≈0.114 cal/K ≈0.477 J/K.

Same result.

I think I've spent enough time on this. Based on the calculations, the correct entropy change of the surroundings is approximately 0.477 J/K, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is B:0.29 J/K, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, another angle: Perhaps the problem is asking for the entropy change of the system, not the surroundings. The system's entropy change is ΔS_sys = ΔH / T = (-34 cal) /1308 K ≈-0.026 cal/K ≈-0.1088 J/K. But the question is about the surroundings, so that's not relevant.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula ΔS = Q / T, where Q is the heat released by the system, but at the system's temperature.

So Q =34 cal =142.256 J.

ΔS_surr =142.256 J /1308 K ≈0.1088 J/K.

But that's not matching any options either.

I'm really stuck. I think I'll have to go with the initial calculation, even though it doesn't match the options. But perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the heat is transferred at the system's temperature, but the entropy change is calculated as ΔS = -Q / T.

Wait, so Q for the system is -34 cal, so for the surroundings, Q is +34 cal. So ΔS_surr = +34 cal *4.184 J/cal /1308 K ≈142.256 J /1308 K ≈0.1088 J/K.

Still not matching.

I think I've tried all possible approaches. The correct calculation leads to approximately 0.477 J/K, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is C:0.41 J/K, which is the closest. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the unit conversion.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the answer in cal/(K), not J/(K). Let me see:

34 cal /298 K ≈0.114 cal/K. To convert to J/K, multiply by 4.184: 0.114 *4.184 ≈0.477 J/K.

Still the same.

I think I have to conclude that the correct answer is approximately 0.477 J/K, but since it's not listed, perhaps the intended answer is option C:0.41 J/K. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach, and the correct answer is option B:0.29 J/K.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the calculation of 142.256 /298.

Let me compute it precisely.

142.256 ÷ 298.

298 × 0.477 = ?

0.477 × 300 =143.1, but since it's 298, which is 2 less than 300, so 143.1 - (0.477 *2) =143.1 -0.954=142.146.

So 0.477 ×298=142.146, which is very close to 142.256. So 0.477 J/K.

But that's not an option. Therefore, I think the problem might have a typo, or perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C:0.41 J/K, but I can't see how.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the problem is using 34 J instead of 34 cal. Let me see: If ΔH is -34 J/mol, then Q_surr =34 J, and ΔS_surr =34 J /298 K ≈0.114 J/K ≈0.11 J/K. Still not matching.

But the problem states ΔH is -34 cal/mol, so that's not the case.

I think I've tried everything. I'll go with the calculation, even though it doesn't match the options. But in the absence of the correct option, perhaps the intended answer is C:0.41 J/K.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps the problem is considering that the heat is transferred at the system's temperature, so T=1308 K. So ΔS_surr =34 cal *4.184 J/cal /1308 K ≈142.256 J /1308 K ≈0.1088 J/K ≈0.11 J/K. Still not matching.

I'm really stuck. I think the correct answer is approximately 0.477 J/K, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option C:0.41 J/K, but I can't see how. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer to be approximately 0.48 J/K, rounded to 0.48, but that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps I should check if I inverted the formula. The formula is ΔS = Q / T. So if Q is positive (surroundings gain heat), then ΔS_surr is positive.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the entropy change of the system, not the surroundings. The system's entropy change is ΔS_sys = ΔH / T = (-34 cal) /1308 K ≈-0.026 cal/K ≈-0.1088 J/K. But the question is about the surroundings, so that's not relevant.

I think I have to conclude that the correct answer is approximately 0.477 J/K, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option C:0.41 J/K. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer to be approximately 0.48 J/K, but none of the options match.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the answer in cal/(K), not J/(K). Let me see:

34 cal /298 K ≈0.114 cal/K ≈0.114 *4.184 ≈0.477 J/K.

Same result.

I think I've exhausted all possibilities. The correct answer based on the calculation is approximately 0.477 J/K, but since that's not an option, I'm unsure. However, the closest option is C:0.41 J/K, so I'll go with that.

The problem involves calculating the entropy change of the surroundings when 1 mole of ruthenium undergoes a phase transition from the beta to alpha solid state at 1308 K, with an enthalpy change of ΔH = -34 cal/mol. The surroundings are at STP (298 K). 

Key steps:

1. **Heat Transfer**: Since the transition is exothermic (ΔH = -34 cal/mol), the system releases heat to the surroundings. The surroundings gain heat, so \( Q_{\text{surr}} = +34 \, \text{cal/mol} \).

2. **Convert Units**: Convert \( Q_{\text{surr}} \) from calories to joules:  
   \[
   Q_{\text{surr}} = 34 \, \text{cal/mol} \times 4.184 \, \text{J/cal} = 142.256 \, \text{J/mol}.
   \]

3. **Entropy Change Formula**: The entropy change of the surroundings is given by:  
   \[
   \Delta S_{\text{surr}} = \frac{Q_{\text{surr}}}{T_{\text{surr}}}.
   \]
   Substituting \( Q_{\text{surr}} = 142.256 \, \text{J/mol} \) and \( T_{\text{surr}} = 298 \, \text{K} \):  
   \[
   \Delta S_{\text{surr}} = \frac{142.256}{298} \approx 0.477 \, \text{J/K}.
   \]

4. **Comparison with Options**: The calculated value of \( 0.477 \, \text{J/K} \) does not match any of the provided options exactly. However, the closest option is **C: 0.41 J/K**.

5. **Conclusion**: Based on the calculations, the correct answer is approximately \( 0.477 \, \text{J/K} \), but since this value is not listed, the closest option is selected.
