Okay, so I've got this question here about ABC Corporation's net income and taxes. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

The question says that ABC had a net income of $1,000,000 in 1976 and pays 50% taxes. They're asking for the income before taxes. Hmm, I think net income is what's left after the company has paid taxes, right? So if they paid 50% in taxes, then the net income is the remaining 50%. 

Wait, let me think again. If the net income is after taxes, then that's what's left after subtracting the tax amount from the pre-tax income. So, if taxes are 50%, that means the net income is 50% of the pre-tax income. 

Let me write that down. Letâ€™s call the income before taxes as 'X'. The taxes paid would be 50% of X, which is 0.5 * X. So, the net income is X minus taxes, which is X - 0.5X = 0.5X. 

They told us the net income is $1,000,000. So, 0.5X = $1,000,000. To find X, I can divide both sides by 0.5. So X = $1,000,000 / 0.5 = $2,000,000. 

Wait, that makes sense because if you take $2 million, pay 50% tax on it, that's $1 million in taxes. Subtracting that from $2 million leaves $1 million, which is the net income given. 

So looking at the options, option C is $2,000,000. That should be the correct answer.

The net income is after taxes, so it represents 50% of the pre-tax income. Solving for pre-tax income gives $2,000,000.

Answer: C
