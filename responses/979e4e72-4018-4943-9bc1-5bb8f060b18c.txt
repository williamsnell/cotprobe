Okay, so I've got this question about calculating the vapor pressure of formic acid at 298.15 K. Hmm, I remember that Gibbs free energy is involved here. Let me think about how these values relate to vapor pressure.

The problem gives me the standard Gibbs free energy of formation for formic acid in both gaseous and liquid states. The values are ΔGf°(HCOOH, g) = -351.0 kJ/mol and ΔGf°(HCOOH, l) = -361.4 kJ/mol. So, the difference between these two should tell me something about the process of vaporization.

Wait, right, when a liquid turns into a gas, that's vaporization. The change in Gibbs free energy for this process is the ΔG for vaporization. So, I can calculate that by subtracting the gaseous form from the liquid form because formation is per mole from elements in their standard states. So, the reaction would be HCOOH(l) → HCOOH(g). The ΔG for this reaction is ΔG_vap = ΔGf(g) - ΔGf(l).

Let me compute that. So, -351.0 minus (-361.4) equals... let's see, that's 10.4 kJ/mol. Oh wait, wait, no, wait. Wait, no, because the reaction is going from liquid to gas. So, the ΔG for the reaction is the Gibbs of gas minus Gibbs of liquid. So, it's -351.0 - (-361.4) = 10.4 kJ/mol. So ΔG°vap is +10.4 kJ/mol. That makes sense because vaporization is usually endothermic, so positive ΔG.

Now, the formula I remember is ΔG° = -RT ln K, where K is the equilibrium constant. But wait, for the reaction I'm considering (liquid → gas), the equilibrium would involve the vapor pressure. So, the equilibrium constant K here would be the vapor pressure (in terms of activity) relative to 1 bar, since standard pressure is 1 bar. But wait, units are in Pa, so I need to remember to convert things properly.

Wait, the activity of a liquid is taken as 1, so the vapor pressure in the gas phase is what contributes to K. So, K_p equals the vapor pressure (P) in terms of bar, because standard pressure is 1 bar. So, the reaction is HCOOH(l) ⇌ HCOOH(g), so Kp = P / P°, where P° is 1 bar. So, Kp = P, where P is in bar.

So, putting it into the equation: ΔG° = -RT ln K. So, 10,400 J/mol (since I converted 10.4 kJ to J) equals -RT ln K. Wait, wait no, wait. Wait, ΔG is positive, so 10,400 J/mol = - (8.314 J/mol·K) * 298.15 K * ln K.

Wait, let me rearrange that: 10400 = - (8.314 * 298.15) * ln K. Let me compute 8.314 * 298.15. Let's see, 8 * 300 is 2400, but more accurately: 8.314 * 298 ≈ 8.314 * 300 = 2494.2, but since it's 298, which is 2 less, 8.314 * 2 ≈ 16.628, so subtract that from 2494.2: 2494.2 - 16.628 ≈ 2477.57 J/mol·K * K, so it's about 2477.57 J/mol.

So, 10400 = -2477.57 * ln K. Wait, but I just realized, the ΔG for the reaction is positive, so the equation should be 10400 = -RT ln K. Wait, no, hold on. Because the reaction is HCOOH(l) → HCOOH(g), and since it's endergonic, the vapor pressure is lower than the standard pressure, so K should be less than 1. So, ln K would be negative, making the right side negative. But 10400 is positive, so that makes sense.

So, rearranging: ln K = -10400 / (8.314 * 298.15). Compute the denominator first. 8.314 * 298.15 ≈ let's calculate it accurately. 298.15 is approximately 298.15. So 8 * 298.15 = 2385.2, 0.314 *298.15 ≈ 93.8. So total ≈ 2385.2 + 93.8 = 2479 J/mol.

So, ln K = -10400 / 2479 ≈ -10400 / 2480 ≈ -4.20. Let me compute that precisely: 2479 * 4 = 9916, 2479*4.2=9916 + (2479 *0.2)= 9916 + 495.8=10411.8. Oh, so 4.2 times 2479 is about 10411.8, which is a bit more than 10400. So 10400 /2479 is approximately 4.196. So ln K ≈ -4.196.

So, K = e^(-4.196). Let me compute that. e^-4 is about 0.0183, e^-4.196 is a bit less. Let me calculate it more accurately. 4.196 is 4 + 0.196. So, e^-4=0.0183156. Then e^-0.196. Let me compute 0.196: ln(1.216) ≈ 0.196, so e^-0.196 ≈ 1/1.216 ≈ 0.8225. So, e^-4.196 ≈ 0.0183156 * 0.8225 ≈ approximately 0.01506.

So, K ≈ 0.01506. But Kp is the vapor pressure in bar, because Kp = P / P°, and P° is 1 bar. So, the vapor pressure P is Kp * P° = 0.01506 bar. But the options are in Pascals, so I need to convert bar to Pascals. 1 bar is 10^5 Pa. So, 0.01506 bar * 1e5 Pa/bar = 1506 Pa. Wait, that's 1.506e3 Pa, which is 1.51e3 Pa. Hmm, looking at the options, option A is 1.51e3 Pa. So that's the answer.

Wait, but wait a moment. I think I might have made a mistake in the sign. Let me double-check. The reaction is HCOOH(l) → HCOOH(g), so the ΔG° for this reaction is ΔGf(g) - ΔGf(l). So, (-351.0) - (-361.4) = +10.4 kJ/mol. So, yes, that's correct.

Then, the equation is ΔG° = -RT ln K. So, 10400 J = - (8.314)(298.15) ln K. So, ln K = -10400 / (8.314 *298.15) ≈ -10400 / 2477.57 ≈ -4.203. So, K = e^{-4.203} ≈ e^-4.203. Let me compute e^-4.203 more accurately. Using a calculator would help, but since I don't have one, I'll estimate.

Wait, e^-4 is about 0.0183, e^-4.2 is about 0.016. So, perhaps around 0.015. So, 0.015 bar is 1500 Pa, which is 1.5e3 Pa. So, Option A is 1.51e3 Pa, which is very close. So, that's the correct answer.

To calculate the vapor pressure of formic acid at 298.15 K, we use the relationship between the Gibbs free energy of vaporization and the equilibrium constant. The standard Gibbs free energy of formation for formic acid is given as:

- ΔGf°(HCOOH, g) = -351.0 kJ/mol  
- ΔGf°(HCOOH, l) = -361.4 kJ/mol  

The Gibbs free energy of vaporization (ΔG°vap) is the difference between the gaseous and liquid forms:

\[
\Delta G^\circ_{\text{vap}} = \Delta G_f^\circ(\text{HCOOH, g}) - \Delta G_f^\circ(\text{HCOOH, l}) = -351.0 - (-361.4) = 10.4 \, \text{kJ/mol}.
\]

Converting to joules:

\[
\Delta G^\circ_{\text{vap}} = 10,400 \, \text{J/mol}.
\]

The equilibrium constant \( K_p \) is related to ΔG° by the equation:

\[
\Delta G^\circ = -RT \ln K_p,
\]

where \( R = 8.314 \, \text{J/mol·K} \) and \( T = 298.15 \, \text{K} \). Rearranging for \( \ln K_p \):

\[
\ln K_p = -\frac{\Delta G^\circ}{RT} = -\frac{10,400}{8.314 \times 298.15}.
\]

Calculating the denominator:

\[
8.314 \times 298.15 \approx 2477.57 \, \text{J/mol}.
\]

Thus:

\[
\ln K_p = -\frac{10,400}{2477.57} \approx -4.20.
\]

Exponentiating to find \( K_p \):

\[
K_p = e^{-4.20} \approx 0.015.
\]

For the vaporization reaction \( \text{HCOOH(l)} \rightarrow \text{HCOOH(g)} \), \( K_p \) represents the vapor pressure in bar. Converting to Pascals:

\[
P = K_p \times 10^5 \, \text{Pa} = 0.015 \times 10^5 = 1500 \, \text{Pa} = 1.51 \times 10^3 \, \text{Pa}.
\]

Thus, the vapor pressure of formic acid at 298.15 K is **1.51 × 10³ Pa**, corresponding to option A.
