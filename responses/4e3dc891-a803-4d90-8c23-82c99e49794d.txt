Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this auditing question. The question is about the test of details an auditor would perform to detect the overstatement of sales. I remember that in auditing, tests of details are procedures performed to obtain evidence about specific assertions related to transactions. The key here is that the objective is to detect overstatement of sales, which I think relates to whether the company is recording more sales than they actually made. So maybe they're recognizing revenue that shouldn't be there or not actually having the sales.

I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact steps, but I think it involves tracing transactions through different journals to ensure they're properly recorded. The options involve various combinations of journals and documents.

Let me recall the sales cycle. Typically, the process starts with a customer placing an order, which is a purchase order. Then, the company would send a sales invoice, and then ship the goods. The shipping documents would support that the goods were actually shipped, which is important because without shipping, the sale might not be complete, especially if terms are FOB destination or something like that.

In the sales journal, each sale is recorded. Then, when payment is received, it's recorded in the cash receipts journal. So, if the auditor is concerned about overstated sales, they might check if each sale was supported by a shipping document because without shipping, the sale might not have occurred yet. Alternatively, they might check if the cash was actually received.

Wait, the question is about overstatement, so the company might be recording sales that haven't shipped yet or that haven't been ordered. So the auditor needs to make sure that each sale in the sales journal is supported by a shipping document. That way, they can confirm that the sale actually happened and the goods were shipped, supporting the revenue recognition.

So the test would involve tracing from the sales journal entries to the corresponding shipping documents. That way, each sale can be verified against the shipping evidence. If there's a sale without a shipping document, that could indicate an overstatement.

Looking at the options, option E is "Sales journal to the shipping documents." That seems to fit because the auditor is checking each sale (from the sales journal) against the shipping docs to ensure they match up.

Wait, but another possibility is that they might start from the shipping documents and see if there's an associated sale. But the question is about detecting an overstatement, so the auditor might start from the sales journal to check for each sale whether there's a corresponding shipping document. That way, if a sale is in the journal without a shipping document, it's overstated.

Alternatively, if they started from the shipping documents, they might check if each shipment is recorded in the sales journal, which could detect understatements, not overstatements. Because if a shipment was made but not recorded, that would be an understatement.

So, to detect overstatement, the auditor would look at the sales journal and check for each entry whether there's a shipping document. So the direction is from the sales journal to the shipping documents, which is option E.

Wait, but another angle: cash receipts. If the company is recording cash receipts without the corresponding sale, that could also overstate sales. But I think the primary way to detect overstatement of sales is to check that each sale has a shipping document. Without shipping, the sale might not have been legitimate yet.

So, I think the correct answer is E: Sales journal to the shipping documents.

The correct answer is E: Sales journal to the shipping documents. This is because the auditor needs to verify that each sale recorded in the sales journal is supported by a shipping document, ensuring the sale actually occurred and was shipped, thereby detecting any overstatement.
