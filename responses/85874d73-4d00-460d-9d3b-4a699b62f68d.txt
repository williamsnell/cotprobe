Question:

Why must mosses and liverworts (phylumBryophyta) always live in close association with the water?

Options:

A: They release spores that can only germinate in water
B: They have no roots, so they must be submerged in water to remain upright
C: They require high humidity environments but do not need direct contact with water
D: Their leaves are adapted to absorb water directly from the atmosphere
E: They lack efficient water absorption and transport systems, and their reproduction requires water.
F: They are aquatic plants
G: They use water as a habitat to avoid predators
H: They need water to photosynthesize
I: They cannot survive in dry environments

Answer:

Okay, so I have this question about why mosses and liverworts (which are part of the phylum Bryophyta) must live close to water. I'm a bit rusty on my plant biology, but I'll try to work through this.

First, I remember that mosses and liverworts are Bryophytes, right? They're among the earliest plants to colonize land. I think they don't have roots like more advanced plants. Roots help plants absorb water and nutrients, but these guys don't have them. So maybe that's part of the reason they need water nearby.

Looking at the options:

Option A: They release spores that can only germinate in water. Hmm, I know that many plants, including mosses, produce spores. But I'm not sure if their spores specifically need water to germinate. I think some do, but I'm not certain that's the main reason they live near water.

Option B: They have no roots, so they must be submerged in water. Wait, but do they need to be submerged? I thought mosses can grow on trees or rocks, so they're not always submerged. They just need moisture in their environment. So maybe B isn't correct.

Option C: They require high humidity environments but don't need direct contact with water. That makes sense because I remember that Bryophytes can't survive in completely dry conditions. They need a moist environment, but maybe they don't have to be underwater. So C is possible.

Option D: Their leaves absorb water directly from the atmosphere. I think their leaves (well, they don't have true leaves, but they have structures called phylloclades) can take in water, but does that mean they need a lot of water around? Or just some moisture in the air?

Option E: They lack efficient water absorption and transport systems, and their reproduction requires water. This sounds familiar. Bryophytes don't have the same vascular systems as higher plants, so they can't transport water efficiently. Plus, their reproduction often involves water because the gametes need to swim. So both reasons make sense. This seems like a strong candidate.

Option F: They are aquatic plants. No, I think they're not strictly aquatic. They can grow on land but need a moist environment.

Option G: They use water to avoid predators. I don't recall anything about this. Seems unlikely.

Option H: They need water to photosynthesize. No, they photosynthesize like other plants, using chlorophyll, but water isn't directly required for that; they just need it for their cells.

Option I: They cannot survive in dry environments. That's true, but it's a result of why they need water, not the reason.

So, the question is why they must live close to water. The key factors are their lack of efficient water transport systems and their reproductive needs. So option E seems to cover both aspects. 

Wait, another thought: their lack of roots (so no vascular system) means they can't move water from the soil up, so they rely on their environment being moist. And their reproduction, which involves the formation of gametes that need water to move (like sperm needing water to swim to the egg), definitely requires a wet environment. So E is the best fit.

The correct answer is E: They lack efficient water absorption and transport systems, and their reproduction requires water. Mosses and liverworts (phylum Bryophyta) do not have roots or a vascular system, making them dependent on a moist environment. Additionally, their reproduction process involves the movement of gametes in water, further necessitating their close association with water.
