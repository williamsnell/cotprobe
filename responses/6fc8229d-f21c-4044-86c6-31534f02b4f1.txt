Okay, so I have this question about meiosis, and I need to figure out which statement is not true. Let me think step by step.

First, I remember that meiosis is a process that reduces the chromosome number by half, which is important for sexual reproduction. The question gives four options, A to D, and I need to find the incorrect one.

Option A says, "Meiosis produces two haploid gametes." Wait, actually, meiosis produces four gametes, not two. Each of these gametes is haploid. So I think A might be the incorrect statement because it's not just two; it's four. Or maybe I'm mixing something up. Wait, no, in humans, each meiosis produces four cells, but in some organisms, it might produce two. Hmm, no, I think in general, meiosis results in four gametes. So A is incorrect because it states two instead of four. But wait, maybe the question is referring to each pair producing two. No, I'm pretty sure each meiosis results in four haploid cells, so A is not true.

Option B: "Homologous chromosomes join during synapsis." That sounds right. Synapsis occurs in prophase I where homologous chromosomes pair up, so B is correct.

Option C: "Sister chromatids separate during meiosis I." Wait, no. In meiosis I, homologous chromosomes separate, not sister chromatids. Sister chromatids separate during meiosis II, like in mitosis. So C is incorrect. Oh wait, so I'm now confused because I thought the question is asking for the statement that's NOT true. So if C says sister chromatids separate in meiosis I, that's wrong. Because that happens in meiosis II.

Wait, so I have two options that seem incorrect: A and C. But the question asks which is NOT true. Let me reevaluate.

Meiosis I: Homologous chromosomes separate (so each cell gets one of each homolog pair). Meiosis II: sister chromatids separate, like mitosis.

So option C is incorrect because sister chromatids separate during meiosis II, not I. So the statement in C is false.

Option D: "Crossing-over increases genetic variation in gametes." That's correct. Crossing-over during prophase I leads to recombinant chromosomes, which increases genetic diversity. So D is true.

So the incorrect statements are A and C. Wait, the question is which is NOT true. So looking back at the options:

A says meiosis produces two haploid gametes. No, it's four. So A is false.

C says sister chromatids separate during meiosis I. No, that's meiosis II. So C is also false.

But the question is asking for which is NOT true. So both A and C are false? But the options can't have two correct answers. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, in some cases, when meiosis produces two cells, like in certain organisms where it's a single division, but generally, meiosis II produces four cells. So the statement in A is incorrect because it's four gametes, not two.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm mixing up terms. Wait, meiosis I results in two cells, each with half the number of chromosomes, and meiosis II splits those into two each, making four total. So each meiosis produces four gametes, so A is wrong.

So the options are:

A: Incorrect (produces four, not two)
B: Correct
C: Incorrect (sister chromatids separate in meiosis II)
D: Correct

Wait, so both A and C are incorrect. But the question is a single choice. Hmm. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the options.

Looking again: option C says "Sister chromatids separate during meiosis I." That's wrong because sister chromatids separate during meiosis II. So C is incorrect.

So the question is which statement is NOT true. So both A and C are incorrect. But the options can only have one correct answer. Wait, perhaps the question is about the last character, but I'm the one choosing.

Wait, the initial question says "Which of the following about meiosis is NOT true?" So I need to pick the false statement.

So the options are:

A: Meiosis produces two haploid gametes. → False, it's four.

B: Homologous chromosomes join during synapsis. → True.

C: Sister chromatids separate during meiosis I. → False, they separate in II.

D: Crossing-over increases genetic variation. → True.

Wait, so both A and C are false. But the options are from A to J, and the user probably expects one answer. Did I misread something?

Wait, perhaps the question is about each gamete. No, the process produces four. So A is incorrect.

So the answer must be either A or C. But the question is asking which is NOT true. So both A and C are incorrect. But the options don't have multiple correct answers. Wait, perhaps the question is only about the process, not the number.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think: the correct answer is C because sister chromatids separate in meiosis II, not I. So C is not true.

Wait, but A says meiosis produces two gametes. That's wrong because it's four. So A is also not true.

Hmm. So I'm confused because both A and C are incorrect. But the options are only A to D, so perhaps the intended answer is C, because that's a more common mistake. Alternatively, maybe the question is phrased differently.

Wait, perhaps the question is about each division. No, the question is about meiosis overall. So the correct answer is that statement C is false, because sister chromatids separate in meiosis II, not I.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the process of meiosis I. So perhaps the intended incorrect statement is C.

Wait, the user is asking which is NOT true. So if I have to choose between A and C, I think the intended answer is C, because it's a common misconception. Or perhaps the question is about the number of gametes.

Wait, I think the intended answer is C. Because the number of gametes might be less commonly known, but more likely, the sister chromatid separation is a common point of confusion.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the number of gametes. So meiosis produces four, so A is wrong.

But the options are A to D, and the correct answer is either A or C.

Wait, I think I should look up the correct facts.

Meiosis I: Homologous chromosomes separate (reductional division), resulting in two cells.

Meiosis II: Sister chromatids separate (equational division), resulting in four cells.

So each meiosis produces four gametes, so A is incorrect because it says two.

Sister chromatids separate in meiosis II, so C is incorrect because it says I.

So both A and C are incorrect statements. But the question asks which is NOT true, implying only one option is incorrect. So perhaps the question is designed so that only one is incorrect.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again.

Option A: Meiosis produces two haploid gametes. → No, four.

Option C: Sister chromatids separate during meiosis I. → No, II.

So both are incorrect, but perhaps the intended answer is C because it's more directly about the process of meiosis I and II.

Wait, but the question is about what is NOT true, so both A and C are incorrect. But in the options given, perhaps only C is the option that is incorrect because the other options are true.

Wait, the initial question is about which is NOT true. So the correct answer would be either A or C.

But looking at the options again, perhaps the intended answer is C because it's a more specific process.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is A because meiosis I produces two cells, and each of those undergo meiosis II to become four. So the total is four. Therefore, A is incorrect.

So the answer is either A or C.

Wait, perhaps the question is about producing two cells, but the process produces four. So A is incorrect.

But I'm not entirely sure. However, I think the more obvious incorrect statement is C because sister chromatids separate in meiosis II, not I. So the correct answer is C.

The question asks which statement about meiosis is NOT true. Let’s analyze each option:

- **Option A**: "Meiosis produces two haploid gametes." This is incorrect because meiosis produces four haploid gametes, not two. 
- **Option B**: "Homologous chromosomes join during synapsis." This is correct, as synapsis occurs during prophase I of meiosis when homologous chromosomes pair.
- **Option C**: "Sister chromatids separate during meiosis I." This is incorrect because sister chromatids separate during meiosis II, not I.
- **Option D**: "Crossing-over increases genetic variation in gametes." This is correct, as crossing-over during prophase I creates recombinant chromosomes, increasing genetic diversity.

Both **A** and **C** are incorrect, but since the question asks for the single statement that is NOT true, the most direct and common misconception is about the timing of sister chromatid separation. Therefore, the answer is **C**.
