Question:

Considering Wendt's three cultures of anarchy; which of the following defines the Lockean culture?

Options:

A: A culture characterized by friendship, where force and violence is eschewed in favour of cooperation in matters of security.
B: A culture in which actors are completely self-reliant and do not seek help from others.
C: A culture within which survival relies on military power, security dilemmas abound, and security is a zero-sum game.
D: A culture characterized by complete distrust, where actors only rely on their own military power for survival.
E: A culture where actors regard each other as threats but do not resort to violence.
F: A culture characterized by mutual understanding and inter-state cooperation without the need for military power.
G: A culture characterized by rivalry, which has dominated since the beginning of the modern system of states and in which actors regard each other as rivals but exercise some restraint in violence.
H: A culture where every state is for itself, and there is no cooperation between actors.
I: A culture characterized by constant warfare with no restraints on violence.
J: A culture that exists some of the time, but not all the time, in which no self-restraint exists and actors cannot rely on each other for help.

Okay, so I have this question about Wendt's three cultures of anarchy, and I need to figure out which option defines the Lockean culture. I'm a bit rusty on my international relations theories, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

First, I remember that Wendt talks about different cultures of anarchy in the international system. He identifies three main ones: the Hobbesian, Lockean, and the Kantian cultures. Wait, but looking at the options, I see some terms like "survival relies on military power" and others. Hmm, maybe I should recall what each of Wendt's cultures entails.

Let me think. The Lockean culture, if I'm not mistaken, is based on the idea of a social contract, similar to John Locke's philosophy. In this context, states recognize each other's sovereignty and have some level of cooperation. They don't necessarily rely solely on military power but instead engage in mutual agreements and maybe even some institutions. So it's a middle ground between the Hobbesian (which is more about the state of nature and survival) and the Kantian (which is more about cooperation and trust).

Looking at the options:

Option A says friendship and cooperation without force. That sounds more Kantian, maybe. Because Kantian states trust each other and cooperate a lot.

Option B: completely self-reliant, no help from others. That might be more Hobbesian, where each state is on its own and doesn't trust others.

Option C: survival on military power, security dilemmas, zero-sum. That also sounds Hobbesian, where states see each other as threats and the only way to survive is through military strength.

Option D: complete distrust, rely only on military. Again, that's Hobbesian.

Option E: regard each other as threats but don't use violence. Maybe a bit like a Lockean? Or perhaps a middle ground. But I'm not sure.

Option F: mutual understanding and cooperation without military. That seems too optimistic, maybe more Kantian.

Option G: rivalry with some restraint. This sounds like the Lockean culture. Because in Lockean, states have a social contract, so they don't go to war often but still see each other as rivals. They exercise restraint because they recognize each other's sovereignty.

Option H: every state for itself, no cooperation. That's Hobbesian.

Option I: constant warfare, no restraints. That's the most extreme, maybe a version of the Hobbesian or even a pure state of nature.

Option J: some of the time no self-restraint, can't rely on others. This sounds a bit vague, maybe a mix, but not specifically Lockean.

Wait, I think I might be mixing up some terms. Let me try to recall. Wendt's Lockean culture is characterized by a balance of power and mutual recognition. States in this culture don't necessarily trust each other completely (unlike Kantian), but they do recognize each other's sovereignty and have a social contract. This leads to less frequent use of force because they can rely on institutions and mutual agreements.

So, looking back at the options, Option G says "a culture characterized by rivalry, which has dominated since the beginning of the modern system of states and in which actors regard each other as rivals but exercise some restraint in violence." That fits because Lockean is about rivalry with some restraint, not constant warfare but not total cooperation either.

Alternatively, Option E says actors regard each other as threats but don't resort to violence. That might be a bit too passive. Option G mentions rivalry and some restraint, which aligns better with the idea of a social contract where states don't use excessive force but still compete.

So, I think the correct answer is G.

The Lockean culture, as defined by Wendt, is characterized by a balance of power and mutual recognition among states. Unlike the Hobbesian culture, which is driven by fear and military competition, or the Kantian culture, which emphasizes trust and cooperation, the Lockean culture involves states recognizing each other's sovereignty while still engaging in rivalry. This recognition leads to some restraint in the use of violence, as states rely on institutions and agreements rather than constant warfare. Among the options provided, Option G best captures this description, as it highlights the presence of rivalry with a degree of restraint in violence.

Answer: G
