Question:

Consider the following three scenarios, which could be modeled using three data structures— dictionary/map, queue, and stack. Scenario 1: Cars line up in a single lane at a car wash. As each driver reaches the entrance of the car wash, the driver gets out of the car. An automatic pulley moves the car through the car wash as the driver walks to the exit of the car wash to pay and pick up the car. Scenario 2: Contestants auditioning for a reality television talent show are assigned a unique numeric ID upon completing a registration form. Scenario 3: Tennis balls are sold in a cylindrical can that can hold a maximum of 3 balls, where each ball except the bottom one rests on top of the ball below it. The 3 balls are placed in the can one at a time through one opening at the top of the can. The 3 balls are removed from the can one at a time through the same opening. Which of the following shows the data structures that best model the scenarios? Scenario 1 | Scenario 2 | Scenario 3

Options:

A: Dictionary/map | Stack | Queue
B: Queue | Stack | Dictionary/map
C: Stack | Stack | Queue
D: Stack | Queue | Dictionary/map
E: Stack | Dictionary/map | Queue
F: Queue | Queue | Stack
G: Dictionary/map | Queue | Stack
H: Dictionary/map | Dictionary/map | Stack
I: Queue | Dictionary/map | Stack
J: Dictionary/map | Queue | Queue

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about data structures and scenarios. Let me try to break it down. The question is asking which data structures model three different scenarios best. The scenarios are:

1. Cars at a car wash line up in a single lane. Drivers get out, cars move through the wash, and they exit to pay and pick up. So, the order here is important. The first car that arrives is the first to get processed. It sounds like a queue because each car is processed in the order they arrive. So maybe Scenario 1 is a queue.

2. Contestants get a unique numeric ID after filling out a form. Here, each contestant is assigned a unique ID. That sounds like a key-value pair, where the contestant's info is stored with their ID as the key. So a dictionary or map would be suitable because we're mapping each contestant to a unique identifier. So Scenario 2 is probably a dictionary.

3. Tennis balls in a can that holds up to 3. Balls are placed one at a time through the top, and removed the same way. Each ball rests on top of the one below. That's a classic stack scenario because you add and remove items from the same end. So when you put a ball in, it's on top, and when you take one out, it's the top one first. So Scenario 3 is a stack.

Wait, let me double-check each scenario:

Scenario 1: The cars line up and each is processed in order. Yes, that's a queue. So Scenario 1 is Queue.

Scenario 2: Assigning unique IDs. Each contestant has a unique ID, which is perfect for a dictionary where the key is the contestant's info and the value is the ID. Or wait, maybe the other way around? If each contestant is given an ID upon registration, the system needs to map each contestant to an ID. So the ID is the key, and the value could be their details. Or perhaps it's the other way, but either way, a dictionary is the right structure because it allows for quick lookups and unique key assignments.

Scenario 3: The can holds up to 3 balls, added and removed from the same opening. That's a stack because it's LIFO—last in, first out. So when you add a ball, it goes on top, and when you take one out, it's the top one. So yes, a stack.

Now, looking at the options:

A: Dictionary, Stack, Queue → No, because Scenario 1 is Queue, not Scenario 3.

B: Queue, Stack, Dictionary → Scenario 3 is Stack, but this option says Dictionary. So maybe not.

C: Stack, Stack, Queue → Scenario 1 is Queue, so this can't be right.

D: Stack, Queue, Dictionary → No, because Scenario 1 is Queue.

E: Stack, Dictionary, Queue → No, Scenario 1 is Queue.

F: Queue, Queue, Stack → Scenario 3 is Stack, but what about Scenario 2? It's a Queue here, but the second scenario is about IDs, which is a Dictionary. So this isn't right.

G: Dictionary, Queue, Stack → Scenario 1 is Queue, so this is wrong.

H: Dictionary, Dictionary, Stack → No, Scenario 3 is Stack, but Scenario 2 is a Dictionary and Scenario 1 is a Queue, so this isn't matching.

I: Queue, Dictionary, Stack → Scenario 1 is Queue, Scenario 2 is Dictionary, Scenario 3 is Stack. So this would be [Queue, Dictionary, Stack]. But let me check the options.

Option I is Queue | Dictionary | Stack. Wait, looking at the options:

Let me list all options again:

A: Dictionary | Stack | Queue

B: Queue | Stack | Dictionary

C: Stack | Stack | Queue

D: Stack | Queue | Dictionary

E: Stack | Dictionary | Queue

F: Queue | Queue | Stack

G: Dictionary | Queue | Stack

H: Dictionary | Dictionary | Stack

I: Queue | Dictionary | Stack

J: Dictionary | Queue | Queue

Wait, so according to our analysis, the correct mapping is:

Scenario 1: Queue

Scenario 2: Dictionary

Scenario 3: Stack

So looking for which option has Queue as first, Dictionary as second, and Stack as third.

Looking at the options, only option I matches this: Queue, Dictionary, Stack.

Wait, but let me check each option again. Option I says:

I: Queue | Dictionary | Stack → So Scenario 1 is Queue, Scenario 2 is Dictionary, Scenario 3 is Stack. That's correct.

Wait, but earlier I thought that for Scenario 2, the data structure is a dictionary. So yes, that's right.

So the correct answer would be option I. But wait, let me make sure I didn't mix up anything.

Wait, no. Let me think again. Scenario 2 is about assigning unique IDs upon registration. So each contestant gets a unique ID. So the system needs to map each contestant to an ID. That's a dictionary where the key could be the contestant's name or some identifier, and the value is the ID. Alternatively, perhaps the contestant is the value and the ID is the key. Either way, it's a dictionary.

So putting it all together, the correct data structures are Scenario 1: Queue; Scenario 2: Dictionary; Scenario 3: Stack.

Looking at the options, which one has Queue, Dictionary, Stack? That's option I: Queue | Dictionary | Stack.

Wait, but let me look at the options again. Oh wait, in the options, the order is Scenario1 | Scenario2 | Scenario3.

So the options are:

A: D | S | Q

B: Q | S | D

C: S | S | Q

D: S | Q | D

E: S | D | Q

F: Q | Q | S

G: D | Q | S

H: D | D | S

I: Q | D | S

J: D | Q | Q

So the correct mapping is Q, D, S → which is option I.

Wait, but I'm getting confused because I thought the answer was E or something else. Let me make sure.

Wait, no. My earlier analysis was:

Scenario 1: Queue

Scenario 2: Dictionary

Scenario 3: Stack

So the data structures for the three scenarios are Queue, Dictionary, Stack.

Looking at the options, that's option I: Queue | Dictionary | Stack.

But wait, when I look at the options again, I think I might have made a mistake. Because in the initial analysis, Scenario 3 is a stack, which is correct.

So the answer should be option I.

Wait, but let me check the options again. Oh no! I think I made a mistake. Because when I look at the options, option I says Scenario 1 is Queue, Scenario 2 is Dictionary, Scenario3 is Stack. That's exactly what we have.

Wait, but earlier I thought the correct answer was option E, which was Stack | Dictionary | Queue. No, that's not right because Scenario 1 is Queue, not Stack.

So yes, the correct option is I: Queue | Dictionary | Stack.
</think>

The correct data structures for the scenarios are:

Scenario 1: Queue  
Scenario 2: Dictionary  
Scenario 3: Stack  

This matches **option I**.
