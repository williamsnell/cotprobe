Question:

An on-duty Police Officer hears breaking glass and a blaring alarm, and sees Stan run out of a darkened liquor store at 3 a.m. Stan runs around the corner, out of Officer's view, and hops into a car. Officer sees Stan drive away and pursues, lights flashing. Stan pulls over and Officer arrests him. Officer sees nothing in the passenger compartment, but pops the trunk and finds cash and a baseball bat. Stan's motion to suppress the cash and baseball bat as evidence will likely be

Options:

A: Denied, because the Officer had a reasonable suspicion that Stan was involved in a crime.
B: Granted, because the arrest was illegal and therefore the evidence is considered to be fruit of the poisonous tree.
C: Granted, because the Officer did not have a search warrant to check the trunk of the car.
D: Granted, because the Officer did not have a valid reason to pull Stan over in the first place.
E: Denied, because a search incident to a valid arrest in an automobile always includes the trunk of the automobile.
F: Denied, because the Officer had probable cause to search the trunk.
G: Denied, because the Officer had the right to search the car without a warrant.
H: Granted, because the trunk area was out of the range of Stan's control.
I: Denied, because the Officer was in the pursuit of his duties and the search was incidental to the arrest.
J: Granted, because the Officer did not observe Stan commit any crime.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this legal question about whether the evidence (cash and baseball bat) should be suppressed. Let me break it down.

The scenario is that an officer hears breaking glass and an alarm, sees Stan running out of a liquor store at 3 a.m., then Stan gets into a car and drives away. The officer pursues, and eventually arrests Stan. Then the officer pops the trunk and finds cash and a bat. Stan is trying to suppress that evidence.

First, I need to remember the rules about when police can search a vehicle. I think the key here is whether the officer had the right to search the trunk without a warrant.

I remember that for cars, the law is a bit different from homes because cars are considered mobile and there's a lower expectation of privacy. The Supreme Court case Maryland v. Leonard (1973) might be relevant here. I think that case said that if an officer has probable cause to believe that a car contains evidence or contraband, they can search the entire vehicle, including the trunk, without a warrant.

So, in this case, the officer saw Stan run out of a store where there was breaking glass and an alarm going off. That sounds like a possible burglary or theft. The officer had probable cause to believe that Stan had just committed a crime, maybe robbery. Then, when the officer arrested Stan, he could search the area around him, which in a car includes the passenger compartment. But wait, the officer didn't find anything in the passenger area, so he popped the trunk.

I think under the automobile exception, if the officer has probable cause, they can search the whole car. But wait, the passenger compartment is immediately accessible, so the officer can search that without a warrant. But the trunk is a different part. Some cases say that the trunk is considered part of the car's area that can be searched because it's within the same vehicle. But I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

Wait, another case, maybe New York v. Belton (1981), said that when an arrest occurs in a car, the officer can search the passenger compartment incident to the arrest because of possible weapons or evidence. But the trunk might not fall under that. So maybe the trunk is a separate area.

But then, if the officer had probable cause to believe the trunk contains evidence, maybe under the automobile exception, they don't need a warrant. So, in this case, after arresting Stan, if the officer had probable cause to search the trunk, then it's okay.

But in the facts, the officer didn't see anything in the passenger compartment but the trunk had cash and a bat. So Stan was arrested for something, maybe the breaking and entering of the store. The cash could be from the crime, and the bat might be used as a weapon.

So, the officer had probable cause to believe the car contained evidence, so the trunk could be searched under the automobile exception. Therefore, the evidence shouldn't be suppressed.

Looking at the options:

A: Denied, because the Officer had a reasonable suspicion that Stan was involved in a crime. Wait, reasonable suspicion is lower than probable cause. If the officer only had reasonable suspicion, that's not enough for an arrest or a search without a warrant. But in this case, the officer probably had probable cause, so A might not be the right reason.

B: Granted, because the arrest was illegal... I don't think the arrest was illegal. The officer saw Stan running after a break-in and alarm, so probable cause for the arrest. So B is probably wrong.

C: Granted, because no search warrant. But under the automobile exception, a warrant isn't needed if there's probable cause. So C might be incorrect.

D: Granted, because no valid reason to pull over. The officer was pursuing after seeing Stan commit what looked like a crime. So pulling over was valid. So D is wrong.

E: Denied, because a search incident to arrest includes the trunk. I'm not sure if the trunk is included. Belton allows search of passenger compartment, but I think the trunk might require probable cause. So E might not be correct.

F: Denied, because probable cause to search the trunk. That sounds right if the officer had probable cause. So F could be the answer.

G: Denied, because right to search without warrant. Again, if probable cause exists, yes, but the issue is whether the trunk is covered under the automobile exception.

H: Granted, because trunk was out of Stan's control. That doesn't make sense. The trunk is part of the car, and if the officer has probable cause, it's searchable.

I: Denied, because search was incidental to arrest. But I thought the trunk might not be considered incident to the arrest. So I'm not sure.

J: Granted, because officer didn't observe the crime. But the officer saw enough to have probable causeâ€”Stan running from a store with an alarm, breaking glass. So J is wrong.

So between F and E. F says denied because probable cause to search the trunk. I think F is correct because the officer had probable cause to believe the trunk contained evidence of a crime, so the search was lawful under the automobile exception.

The scenario involves an officer arresting Stan after seeing him run from a liquor store with a broken alarm and pursuing him. The officer then searches the trunk and finds evidence. The key legal issue is whether the search of the trunk was lawful under the automobile exception, which allows warrantless searches if there is probable cause to believe the vehicle contains evidence of a crime.

The officer had probable cause to believe Stan committed a crime (likely theft or burglary) and that the car might contain evidence. Under the automobile exception, a warrant is not required if there is probable cause. The trunk, being part of the vehicle, falls under this exception. Therefore, the search was lawful, and the evidence should not be suppressed.
