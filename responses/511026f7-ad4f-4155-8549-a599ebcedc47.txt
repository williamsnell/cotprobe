Okay, so I've got this question about holograms and how the image changes when viewed with different wavelengths. Hmm, I remember that holograms involve interference patterns, right? They're made using a laser or some coherent light source. When you make a hologram, you're essentially recording the light's wavefronts from an object, and when you view it, you reconstruct that image using the same wavelength, I think.

Wait, the question says the hologram is made with orange light, 600 nm. Then it's viewed with green light, 500 nm. So the recording and playback wavelengths are different. I remember that the reconstruction process relies on the wavelength used during recording. Oh right, the formula for the image distance in a hologram. I think the image distance depends on the wavelength used to read it.

Let me try to recall. When you make a hologram, the interference pattern is set up based on the wavelength λ_used. When you view it with another wavelength λ_view, the image distance changes. I think the formula relates the object distance and the image distance based on the ratio of the wavelengths.

Wait, the relationship is something like the image distance equals the object distance multiplied by (λ_view / λ_used). Or is it the other way around? Or maybe it's (λ_used / λ_view)? I'm a bit confused.

Wait, when you use a shorter wavelength to view, what happens? The fringes become more closely spaced because shorter wavelength means higher frequency, so the pattern is more detailed. But how does that affect the image distance?

I think the image distance depends inversely on the wavelength. So if you use a shorter wavelength (500 nm vs 600 nm), the image distance would be larger. Because the formula might be like image distance = object distance * (λ_view / λ_used). Wait, but no, I think it's the opposite. Let me think.

Wait, I think the image distance is determined by the condition of the interference. The formula for the image distance in a hologram is given by (d * λ_used) / λ_view, where d is the object distance. Wait, no, maybe it's (λ_used / λ_view) times the object distance. Or perhaps the image distance is object distance multiplied by (λ_used / λ_view). Because when λ_view is smaller, the image distance increases.

Wait, let's get it straight. The formula I remember is that the image distance (l) is equal to the object distance (d) multiplied by (λ_view / λ_used). Because when you reconstruct, the condition is that the light from the object and the reference must interfere constructively. So the path difference should be an integer multiple of the wavelength used during viewing.

So, l = d * (λ_view / λ_used). Wait, no, maybe it's the opposite. Because if you have a shorter wavelength, the same path difference would require more phase changes, which could translate to a smaller image. Or perhaps the image is scaled.

Alternatively, I've heard that when you change the wavelength, the image is scaled by the ratio of the new wavelength to the original. So if λ_view is smaller than λ_used, the image distance is smaller. So l = d * (λ_view / λ_used).

Wait, let's plug in the numbers. Suppose the object distance is d. The hologram is made with λ_used = 600 nm. When viewed with λ_view = 500 nm.

So l = d * (500 / 600) = d * (5/6). So the image distance is 5/6 times the object distance. Wait, but that would be a smaller image. But wait, I'm not sure if the formula is correct.

Alternatively, maybe the image distance is determined by the ratio λ_used / λ_view. So if you use a shorter wavelength to view, the image distance would be (600/500) times the object distance, which is 6/5, so 1.2 times. That would mean the image is bigger. But which is correct?

Wait, I think I need to get this formula right. Holograms are typically recorded using a specific wavelength, and when reconstructed with a different wavelength, the scaling factor is (λ_reconstruction / λ_recording). So the image distance (l) is l = d * (λ_reconstruction / λ_recording).

So in this case, λ_reconstruction is 500 nm, λ_recording is 600 nm. So l = d * (500/600) = (5/6) d. So the image distance is 5/6 times the object distance, which is option F.

Wait, but another thought: I remember that when you use a shorter wavelength, the image might appear closer or farther. Another way to think about it is that the hologram is a diffraction grating, and the diffraction condition depends on the wavelength. The diffraction angle is given by sinθ = mλ / d, where d is the grating spacing. But since the grating spacing is determined by the original wavelength, using a different wavelength would change the angles, which in turn affects the image distance.

In the case of a hologram, the image is formed based on the interference of the reference and object beams. The condition for reconstruction is that the optical path difference between the two beams equals an integer multiple of the viewing wavelength. So, if the original setup was for λ_used, when you change to λ_view, the position where the interference occurs changes.

Let me think of it this way: during recording, the interference fringes are spaced according to 2λ_used. When viewing with λ_view, the fringe spacing would be 2λ_view. So, the reconstruction would require that the path difference is mλ_view, where m is an integer.

But how does this translate into image distance? The image distance would be determined by the ratio of the wavelengths. So if you reconstruct with a shorter wavelength, the image would form closer or farther?

Wait, let's say the original setup had the image at distance l when using λ_used. When changing to λ_view, the path difference must satisfy mλ_view = original mλ_used. So the new image distance l' would be l * (λ_view / λ_used). Because the same physical path difference must correspond to a multiple of the new wavelength.

So l' = l * (λ_view / λ_used). Since λ_view < λ_used, l' is smaller than l. So the image distance is smaller.

In the question, the object is at distance d. So the original image distance was d. When viewed with 500 nm, it would be d * (500/600) = (5/6) d. So the image distance is 5/6 times the object distance. So option F.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I'm not 100% sure about the exact formula. Another thought: the image distance depends on the ratio of the wavelengths. So if you use a shorter wavelength, the image is scaled down by that ratio. So yes, 5/6 times. So the answer should be F.

The question involves understanding how the image distance in a hologram changes when viewed with a different wavelength than the one used to create it. Holograms are based on interference patterns, and the image distance depends on the wavelength of light used during reconstruction. The relationship between the object distance \( d \), the reconstructed image distance \( l \), and the wavelengths is given by:

\[
l = d \cdot \frac{\lambda_{\text{view}}}{\lambda_{\text{used}}}
\]

Here, \( \lambda_{\text{used}} = 600 \, \text{nm} \) (orange light) is the wavelength used to create the hologram, and \( \lambda_{\text{view}} = 500 \, \text{nm} \) (green light) is the wavelength used to view it. Substituting these values:

\[
l = d \cdot \frac{500}{600} = d \cdot \frac{5}{6}
\]

This means the reconstructed image distance is \( \frac{5}{6} \) times the object distance. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**F: The reconstructed image distance = \( \frac{5}{6} \) the object distance**

Answer: F
