Question:

Universal Fur is located in Clyde, Baffin Island, and sells high-quality fur bow ties throughout the world at a price of $5 each. The production function for fur bow ties (q) is given by q = 240x - 2x^2, where x is the quantity of pelts used each week. Pelts are supplied only by Dan's Trading Post, which obtains them by hiring Eskimo trappers at a rate of $10 per day. Dan's weekly production function for pelts is given by x = \sqrt{l}, where l represents the number of days of Eskimo time used each week. For a quasi-competitive case in which both Universal Fur and Dan's Trading Post act as price-takers for pelts, what will be the equilibrium price (p_x) for pelt?

Options:

A: 300
B: 900
C: 200
D: 800
E: 1100
F: 400
G: 1000
H: 700
I: 500
J: 600

Okay, so I have this economics problem here about Universal Fur and Dan's Trading Post. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem is about finding the equilibrium price of pelts, p_x. Both companies are price-takers, which means they accept the market price for pelts and don't have any influence over it. So, we're looking for the price where the supply of pelts equals the demand for pelts in the market.

Let's break down the information given.

Universal Fur's production function is q = 240x - 2x², where x is the quantity of pelts they use each week. They sell each bow tie for $5. So, their revenue would be 5*q, right? Which is 5*(240x - 2x²). 

Since Universal Fur is a price-taker, they'll maximize their profit by choosing the quantity x that maximizes their profit. Profit is total revenue minus total cost. Their cost here is the cost of pelts, which depends on how many pelts they buy. But wait, where do they get the pelts? From Dan's Trading Post.

Dan's Trading Post supplies the pelts. They get pelts by hiring Eskimo trappers at $10 per day. Their production function is x = sqrt(l), where l is the number of days of Eskimo time used each week. So, Dan's will choose l to maximize their own profit, considering the price of pelts, which is p_x.

So, first, I think I need to find the demand for pelts by Universal Fur and the supply from Dan's Trading Post, then set them equal to find the equilibrium price.

Let me start by finding Universal Fur's demand for pelts. Since they're a price-taker, they maximize profit by choosing x where marginal revenue equals marginal cost. The cost here is the cost of pelts, which is p_x per pelt, so total cost is p_x * x. 

So, U.F.'s profit π = 5*(240x - 2x²) - p_x * x.

Wait, but p_x is the price they pay for each pelt, so yes, that's their cost.

To maximize profit, take the derivative of π with respect to x and set it to zero.

dπ/dx = 5*(240 - 4x) - p_x = 0.

So, 5*(240 -4x) = p_x.

Simplify that: 1200 - 20x = p_x.

So, the demand function for pelts by Universal Fur is x = (1200 - p_x)/20.

Wait, no, the demand function is the quantity demanded as a function of price. So, rearranging the above equation:

p_x = 1200 - 20x.

So, x = (1200 - p_x)/20.

But I think it's easier to express demand as x = (1200 - p_x)/20. Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me double-check.

Wait, the equation is p_x = 1200 - 20x. So, solving for x gives x = (1200 - p_x)/20.

So, the demand for pelts by U.F. is x = (1200 - p_x)/20.

Wait, that doesn't seem right because if p_x increases, x decreases, which makes sense. So, their demand curve is x = (1200 - p_x)/(20).

Wait, perhaps I should think of it as x = (1200 - p_x)/20. So, that's the demand function.

Now, moving on to Dan's Trading Post. They supply pelts to U.F., but how? Dan's production function is x = sqrt(l), where l is the number of days they hire trappers each week. The cost for Dan's is $10 per day, so total cost is 10*l.

Dan's will choose l to maximize their profit, which is the revenue from selling pelts minus their cost. The revenue is p_x * x, since they sell x pelts at price p_x. But x is sqrt(l), so revenue is p_x * sqrt(l). Their cost is 10*l.

So, profit π_d = p_x * sqrt(l) - 10*l.

To maximize this, take the derivative with respect to l and set to zero.

dπ_d/dl = (p_x) * (1/(2*sqrt(l))) ) - 10 = 0.

So, (p_x)/(2*sqrt(l)) ) = 10.

Rearranging, sqrt(l) = p_x/(20).

Then, square both sides: l = (p_x)^2 / (400).

But Dan's production function is x = sqrt(l). So, substituting l:

x = sqrt( (p_x^2)/400 ) = p_x / 20.

So, the supply function from Dan's is x = p_x / 20.

So, Dan's will supply x = p_x/20 pelts at price p_x.

Now, in equilibrium, the quantity demanded by U.F. equals the quantity supplied by Dan's.

So, set U.F.'s demand equal to Dan's supply.

U.F. demand: x = (1200 - p_x)/20.

Dan's supply: x = p_x/20.

Set them equal:

(1200 - p_x)/20 = p_x/20.

Multiply both sides by 20:

1200 - p_x = p_x.

So, 1200 = 2 p_x.

Thus, p_x = 600.

Wait, that's one of the options. Option J is 600.
</think>

The equilibrium price for pelts is found by equating the demand from Universal Fur and the supply from Dan's Trading Post. Universal Fur's demand is derived from maximizing profit, leading to \( x = \frac{1200 - p_x}{20} \). Dan's supply is \( x = \frac{p_x}{20} \). Setting these equal gives \( \frac{1200 - p_x}{20} = \frac{p_x}{20} \), solving to \( p_x = 600 \).
