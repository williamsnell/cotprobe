Question:

In class, John's teacher tells him that she will give him the coin and bill for each picture he can correctly identify on the face of the penny, nickel, dime, quarter, half-dollar, dollar bill, and five-dollar bill. John cannot identify any of them although he has been handling money for 17 years. His inability to remember the pictures most likely results from

Options:

A: sensory memory decay
B: retroactive interference
C: failure to encode
D: failure to reconstruct
E: false memory formation
F: lack of attention
G: failure to retrieve
H: confabulation
I: deep processing
J: proactive interference

Answer:

Okay, so I have this question about why John can't remember the faces on different coins and bills. Let me try to break this down. 

John is 17 years old and has been handling money for 17 years, which is his whole life. But he can't identify the pictures on the coins and bills. The teacher is offering him coins and bills for each correct identification, but he can't do it. The question is asking about the reason behind his inability to remember these pictures.

The options are from A to J, and I need to figure out which one fits best. Let's go through each option:

A: Sensory memory decay. That's about losing information quickly, like right after perceiving something. But John has had a lot of time with money, so it's not just a quick decay.

B: Retroactive interference. That's when new information interferes with old memories. If he had learned something new that's conflicting, but I don't think that's the case here.

C: Failure to encode. Encoding is how we process information into memory. If he didn't encode it, he never stored it. But he's been handling money for 17 years, so maybe he should have encoded it by now. Unless he never paid attention.

D: Failure to reconstruct. Reconstruction is about how we piece together memories, maybe adding details. But this seems more about retrieval than encoding.

E: False memory formation. That's when you remember something that didn't happen. Doesn't seem related here.

F: Lack of attention. If he didn't pay attention when handling money, he might not have encoded the information. That makes sense because attention is key in encoding.

G: Failure to retrieve. This is about not being able to access stored information. But if he's never stored it properly, maybe it's more about encoding than retrieval.

H: Confabulation. That's making up false memories, which isn't the case here.

I: Deep processing. That's a method of encoding, like understanding the meaning. If he didn't use deep processing, maybe he didn't encode it well. But the question is about inability, not the method used.

J: Proactive interference. That's when old information interferes with new learning. If he had learned something before that's blocking new info, but again, he's been handling money for years.

So, considering all this, the key point is that John has been handling money for a long time but can't identify the faces. If he never paid attention to the details, he wouldn't have encoded the information. So the failure is in encoding, which is option C. Alternatively, it could be about retrieval, but more likely it's that he didn't encode it properly because he didn't pay attention.

The question revolves around John's inability to remember the faces on coins and bills despite handling money for 17 years. The key issue seems to be related to how information is processed and stored in memory. 

- **Sensory memory decay (A)** is unlikely because the decay happens quickly and John has had ample time to encode the information.
- **Retroactive interference (B)** involves new information blocking old memories, which isn't applicable here.
- **Failure to encode (C)** refers to not processing information into memory, which aligns with the idea that John may not have paid attention to the details needed to encode the faces.
- **Failure to reconstruct (D)** is about piecing together memories, which isn't the primary issue here.
- **False memory formation (E)** and **confabulation (H)** are about creating false memories, which doesn't fit the scenario.
- **Lack of attention (F)** ties into encoding, as without attention, information isn't properly encoded.
- **Failure to retrieve (G)** is about accessing stored information, but if the information wasn't encoded, retrieval isn't the main issue.
- **Proactive interference (J)** involves old information blocking new learning, which isn't relevant here.

The most plausible explanation is that John failed to encode the information because he didn't pay attention to the details. Therefore, the answer is:

C
