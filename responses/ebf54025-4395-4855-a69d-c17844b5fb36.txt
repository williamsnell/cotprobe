Okay, so I've got this question here about constitutional law, and I need to figure out which amendment applies to the statute in question. Let me break it down step by step.

The question describes a march highlighting that minorities are still disenfranchised in elections. A congressional report found that only 42% of eligible minorities were registered, and some states had residency laws restricting voting rights. Congress then passed a statute declaring any law denying minorities the right to vote as unconstitutional.

I remember that the Constitution has several amendments related to voting rights. The key here is that this statute is about ensuring minorities can vote, so I'm thinking about amendments that deal with voting rights, especially for specific groups.

Let me go through each option:

A: Twenty-sixth Amendment. That's about lowering the voting age to 18, so probably not relevant here.

B: Tenth Amendment. That's about states' rights, powers reserved to the states. Doesn't directly relate to voting rights.

C: Eighth Amendment. That's about cruel and unusual punishment, so not related.

D: Seventeenth Amendment. That's about direct election of senators, not about voting rights for minorities.

E: Twentieth Amendment. It deals with the terms of Congress and the President, not voting rights.

F: Fourteenth Amendment. This one includes Section 2 which deals with apportionment and states denying voting rights. But more importantly, Section 5 gives Congress the power to enforce it. However, the Fourteenth is more about equal protection and citizenship, and while it's relevant, there's another more specific one.

G: Thirteenth Amendment. That's about abolishing slavery, so not directly related.

H: Nineteenth Amendment. This grants women the right to vote. The question is about minorities, so unless it's about gender, this might not fit.

I: First Amendment. That's about freedoms like speech, religion, etc., not directly about voting rights.

J: Fifteenth Amendment. Ah, this one specifically addresses voting rights. Section 1 says that the right to vote can't be denied based on race, color, or previous condition of servitude. Congress has the authority to enforce this through legislation, which aligns with the statute in the question.

So the statute is making any law that denies minorities the right to vote unconstitutional. The Fifteenth Amendment is the one that prohibits such discrimination in voting. Congress's statute would be enforcing this amendment, so J is the correct answer.

The statute in question addresses the disenfranchisement of minorities in voting, which aligns with the Fifteenth Amendment. This amendment specifically prohibits states from denying voting rights based on race, color, or previous servitude and grants Congress the authority to enforce this through legislation.

Answer: J
