Question:

 Ashford defines a structural human rights violation as

Options:

A: all of the above
B: none of the above.
C: the violation of fundamental human rights brought about the political structures of a particular government.
D: ongoing patterns of behavior by a large number of agents which predictably result in many others coming to be deprived of the object of a fundamental human right: the means of subsistence.
E: the violation of human rights brought about by economic structures.
F: violations that result from the cultural and religious beliefs of a society.
G: ongoing patterns of behavior by a small number of agents which unpredictably result in many others coming to be deprived of the object of a fundamental human right.
H: violations of human rights that are unintentional but result from the societal structures.
I: violations of human rights that pertain to the structure of a person's practical, social, and political agency.
J: the violation of human rights caused by environmental factors.

Alright, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about structural human rights violations as defined by Ashford. I'm a bit new to this topic, so I'll need to break it down step by step.

First, I need to understand what structural human rights violations are. From what I remember, human rights violations can be direct, like someone physically harming another person, or structural, which are more systemic and rooted in the way society is organized. Structural issues might involve things like economic policies, social structures, or political systems that indirectly cause harm over time.

The question is asking specifically how Ashford defines a structural human rights violation. The options are from A to J, so I need to consider each one carefully.

Option A is "all of the above." That seems too broad, and I don't think Ashford would define it as all possible causes. So I'll probably rule this out.

Option B is "none of the above." That's a bit extreme, but I'll keep it in mind in case none fit.

Option C says it's the violation due to the political structures of a government. That makes sense because political structures can create systems that violate rights, like oppressive laws or lack of democracy. But is this the structural part, or is it more about the broader systems like economy or society?

Option D describes ongoing patterns by many agents leading to deprivation of subsistence. This sounds more like a systemic issue affecting many people, perhaps through economic policies or social structures. It mentions "many agents" and "predictably" causing deprivation, which aligns with structural issues.

Option E is about economic structures causing violations. That's another structural factor, like poverty caused by unfair economic policies.

Option F attributes violations to cultural and religious beliefs. While beliefs can influence rights, this seems more like a direct cause rather than a structural one, unless the structures are based on those beliefs.

Option G talks about a small number of agents causing unpredictable deprivation. This seems more like individual or specific actions rather than a systemic structural issue, so probably not.

Option H mentions unintentional societal structure-related violations. That's close, but it's about societal structures, not necessarily the broader structural aspects like political or economic systems.

Option I refers to violations affecting the structure of a person's agency. This seems more about individual capability rather than systemic structures, so maybe not.

Option J is about environmental factors. While the environment can impact rights, this seems more specific and not the primary definition of structural violations.

Now, looking back at the options, I think structural violations are broader systems, like economic or political structures, that indirectly cause rights issues. Option C is political structures, which is one aspect, but Ashford might define it more broadly.

Option D talks about ongoing patterns by many agents causing deprivation, which sounds like a systemic issue that's structural. It's about how the system operates, leading to rights violations predictably.

Option E is about economic structures, which is another structural aspect. So maybe Ashford includes both political and economic structures.

Wait, the question is about how Ashford defines it. I'm not exactly sure, but I think structural violations are about systems and structures beyond just individual actions. So perhaps the correct answer is either C, E, or D.

Option D specifically mentions ongoing patterns affecting subsistence. Subsistence is about basic needs, so this could be an economic issue. The wording about many agents and predictability fits structural issues.

Alternatively, option C is about political structures, which also makes sense. But I'm not sure if Ashford specifies it that way.

Wait, another angle: structural human rights violations are often discussed in terms of systemic issues that are not caused by specific actions but by the structure itself. So, for example, if a country's political system is undemocratic, that's a structural issue. Similarly, economic structures like poverty can be another.

Looking at the options, both C and E seem possible. But the question is about Ashford's definition. I think Ashford might have a specific take on this.

Alternatively, option I says it's about the structure of a person's practical, social, and political agency. That sounds more like an individual's capability, which might not fit the systemic idea.

Hmm, maybe I should think about the key terms. Structural violations are about systems that perpetuate rights issues. So, the answer should involve a system or structure, not individual actions.

Option D says ongoing patterns by a large number of agents, predictably causing many to lose subsistence. That seems to fit because it's a systemic issue affecting many, through the structure of the society's behavior.

Alternatively, option C is about political structures, which is a specific structural aspect. I'm not sure if Ashford includes more than that.

Wait, I think I remember that structural violations are broader than just political or economic; they can include social structures as well. So perhaps the answer is more about the system as a whole.

Looking at the options again, option D seems to capture the systemic nature, where many agents are involved in ongoing behaviors that lead to deprivation. It's not just a single cause but a pattern that affects many.

So, putting it all together, I think the correct answer is D.

The correct answer is D: ongoing patterns of behavior by a large number of agents which predictably result in many others coming to be deprived of the object of a fundamental human right: the means of subsistence.

**Answer: D**
