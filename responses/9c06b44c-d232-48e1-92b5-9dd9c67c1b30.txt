Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric charges and the force between them. Let me try to figure this out step by step. Hmm, I remember from school that Coulomb's Law is involved when dealing with the forces between point charges. Alright, let's break it down.

The problem says there's a negative point charge of 10^-6 coulombs at the origin. Then there's another negative point charge of 10^-4 coulombs on the positive x-axis, 50 cm away from the origin. I need to find the force on the second charge.

Wait, Coulomb's Law states that the force between two point charges is directly proportional to the product of their charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. The formula is F = k * |q1 * q2| / r². Right, k is Coulomb's constant, which I think is about 8.988×10^9 N·m²/C².

Both charges are negative, so the force should be attractive because opposite charges attract. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, wait. No, wait, if both charges are negative, they repel each other. Oh right, because like charges repel. So the force on the second charge will push it away from the first. But since the second charge is on the positive x-axis, moving away would take it further along the positive x-axis, so the direction is along the x-axis away from the origin. But the question just asks for the magnitude, I think, so the direction might not be necessary in the answer.

So, the charges are q1 = 10^-6 C and q2 = 10^-4 C. The distance r is 50 cm, which is 0.5 meters.

Let me plug these into Coulomb's formula. F = k * (q1 * q2) / r². So substituting the numbers:

F = (8.988e9) * (1e-6 * 1e-4) / (0.5)^2.

Wait, let me calculate each part step by step. First, multiply the charges: 1e-6 * 1e-4 = 1e-10 C².

Then, the denominator is (0.5)^2 = 0.25 m².

So, F = (8.988e9) * (1e-10) / 0.25.

Let me compute that. 8.988e9 multiplied by 1e-10 is 8.988e-1. Then divide by 0.25.

So 8.988e-1 is 0.8988. Dividing that by 0.25 is the same as multiplying by 4, so 0.8988 *4 = approximately 3.5952 newtons.

Wait, that's about 3.6 N. Let me check the options. Option A is 3.6 newtons. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a calculation mistake.

Wait, let me redo the calculations:

q1 = 1e-6 C, q2 = 1e-4 C. So product is 1e-10 C². k is 8.988e9 N·m²/C². The distance squared is (0.5)^2 = 0.25 m².

So F = (8.988e9) * (1e-10) / 0.25.

Calculate numerator: 8.988e9 * 1e-10 = 8.988e-1 = 0.8988.

Divide by 0.25: 0.8988 / 0.25 = 3.5952 N, which rounds to approximately 3.6 N.

So the force should be 3.6 newtons. Looking at the options, option A is 3.6 N. But wait, the charges are both negative, so the force is repulsive. So the direction is along the x-axis away from the origin, but since the question only asks for the force magnitude, it's 3.6 N.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake with the exponent. Let me check that again.

Wait, (1e-6) * (1e-4) = 1e-10. Correct. Then 8.988e9 times 1e-10 is 8.988e-1. Correct. Then 8.988e-1 / 0.25 is indeed 3.5952, which is about 3.6. So option A is the answer.

The force between the two charges is calculated using Coulomb's Law:  
\[ F = k \cdot \frac{|q_1 \cdot q_2|}{r^2} \]  
where \( k = 8.988 \times 10^9 \, \text{N·m}^2/\text{C}^2 \), \( q_1 = 10^{-6} \, \text{C} \), \( q_2 = 10^{-4} \, \text{C} \), and \( r = 0.5 \, \text{m} \).  

Substituting the values:  
\[
F = \frac{(8.988 \times 10^9) \cdot (10^{-6} \cdot 10^{-4})}{(0.5)^2} = \frac{(8.988 \times 10^9) \cdot (10^{-10})}{0.25} = \frac{0.8988}{0.25} \approx 3.6 \, \text{N}.
\]  
The charges are both negative, so the force is repulsive, but the magnitude is \( 3.6 \, \text{N} \).
