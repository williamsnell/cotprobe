Okay, so I have this question about a performance formula and which theorist it's associated with. The formula given is Performance = Expectation × Value. Hmm, I remember from my psychology classes that there are several theories related to motivation and performance. Let me think through each option.

Option A is Jean Piaget and Cognitive Development Theory. Piaget's theory is about how children develop认知 skills through stages, like sensorimotor, preoperational, etc. I don't recall him having a formula like this, so maybe not A.

Option B is Abraham Maslow and Hierarchy of Needs. Maslow's theory is about needs arranged in a hierarchy, from basic to self-actualization. He talked about motivation, but I don't remember a formula involving Expectation and Value. So probably not B.

Option C is Edward Tolman and Expectancy-Value Theory. Tolman is known for his work on learning and behavior, especially in the context of expectations. I think the Expectancy-Value Theory is actually from someone else, maybe not Tolman. Wait, I'm a bit confused here. Let me think. Oh, right, I think the Expectancy-Value Theory is more associated with someone like Vroom or maybe Tolman. Or was it another theorist?

Option D is Ivan Pavlov and Classical Conditioning. Pavlov's work is about conditioned reflexes, like the famous dog experiment. His theory doesn't deal with expectations or value in terms of performance, so D is probably not the answer.

Option E is Carl Rogers and Humanistic Theory. Rogers talked about the self-concept and unconditional positive regard. His theory isn't about performance formulas, so E is out.

Option F is Clark Hull and Reinforcement Theory. Hull's theory deals with drives and how behavior is motivated by biological needs, using principles like drive reduction. His work might involve some equations, but I don't think this specific formula is his.

Option G is Albert Bandura and Social Learning Theory. Bandura focused on observational learning and self-efficacy. While self-efficacy relates to expectations, I'm not sure if the formula Performance = Expectation × Value is his. He might have discussed the role of expectations, but I'm not certain.

Option H is John Watson and Behaviorism. Watson is the father of behaviorism, focusing on observable behaviors and conditioning. His work doesn't tie into this kind of formula, so H is unlikely.

Option I is B.F. Skinner and Operant Conditioning. Skinner's theory is about reinforcement and punishment shaping behavior. While operant conditioning deals with value (like the value of a reinforcer), I'm not sure if he proposed this specific formula.

Option J is Sigmund Freud and Psychoanalytic Theory. Freud's theory deals with the unconscious mind and defense mechanisms. Not at all related to performance formulas, so J is out.

Wait, I think I might have mixed up some theorists. Let me think again. The formula Performance = Expectation × Value sounds a lot like something from the Expectancy Theory. Oh right, Victor Vroom developed the Expectancy Theory, which states that motivation (which could relate to performance) is the product of three factors: expectancy, instrumentality, and valence. But wait, the question mentions "Expectancy-Value Theory," which might be a bit different.

Edward Tolman did work on the theory of motivation where he proposed that behavior is driven by the expectation of certain outcomes. His theory might be close to this formula. Alternatively, I think Clark Hull also had a formula in his work, like Performance = (Drive × Incentive) / (Fatigue + Set). But that's not the same as Expectation × Value.

Wait, the question says "Expectancy × Value." So maybe it's referring to the Expectancy-Value Theory, which was developed by someone else. I think the correct answer is Edward Tolman and Expectancy-Value Theory, which would be option C. But I'm a bit confused because I thought the formula might be from another theorist. Alternatively, it could be Clark Hull, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another thought: I remember that the formula Performance = Expectancy × Value is part of Edward Tolman's theory. He discussed how expectations and the value of goals influence performance. So the answer should be C: Edward Tolman and Expectancy-Value Theory.

The formula Performance = Expectation × Value is associated with Edward Tolman and his Expectancy-Value Theory. This theory emphasizes how expectations and the value of outcomes influence behavior and performance. 

Answer: C
