Question:

IfDNAaseis added to a bacterial cell, the DNA is hydrolyzed , the cell cannot make any more proteins and eventually dies. IfDNAaseis added to RNA viruses, they continue to produce new proteins. Explain.

Options:

A: DNAase specifically targets bacterial DNA, not viral DNA.
B: The virus doesn't contain any genetic material.
C: The virus contains RNA, it is not affected by DNAase.
D: The virus encodes its own DNAase inhibitor, protecting its DNA.
E: The virus contains both DNA and RNA.
F: The virus uses a DNAase-resistant polymerase for replication.
G: The virus has an outer shell that prevents DNAase from entering.
H: The virus contains a special type of DNA that is resistant to DNAase.
I: The virus contains DNA, but DNAase is only effective in bacterial cells.
J: The virus contains DNA, it is not affected by DNAase.

Okay, so I have this biology question about DNAase and its effects on bacterial cells versus RNA viruses. Let me try to break this down step by step.

The question says that when DNAase is added to bacterial cells, the DNA gets hydrolyzed, the cell can't make more proteins, and eventually dies. But when the same enzyme is added to RNA viruses, they continue to produce new proteins. I need to figure out why that is the case.

First, I remember that DNAase is an enzyme that breaks down DNA. So, if it's added to bacteria, which have DNA, the enzyme would break the DNA, which makes sense because without DNA, the bacteria can't produce proteins, so they die. That part I get.

Now, the tricky part is the RNA viruses. The question states that after adding DNAase, the viruses still make new proteins. So why isn't DNAase affecting them?

Wait, RNA viruses don't have DNA, right? They have RNA as their genetic material. So if DNAase is added, it shouldn't affect the RNA because DNAase targets DNA, not RNA. That would mean the virus's genetic material is safe, allowing them to continue producing proteins. 

Let me look at the options:

Option A says DNAase targets bacterial DNA, not viral DNA. But wait, if the virus has DNA, this wouldn't explain it. But RNA viruses have RNA, not DNA.

Option B says the virus has no genetic material. That's not right because they do; they have RNA.

Option C states the virus has RNA, so DNAase doesn't affect them. That makes sense because DNAase doesn't act on RNA. This seems correct.

Option D suggests the virus has an inhibitor. I don't recall RNA viruses having such a mechanism, and it's more about their genetic material type.

Option E says they have both DNA and RNA. No, RNA viruses typically have RNA only.

Option F talks about a DNAase-resistant polymerase. I'm not sure about that, but I think it's more about the genetic material type.

Option G mentions an outer shell blocking DNAase. Maybe, but the question is about the enzyme's effect on the genetic material, not physical barriers.

Option H says the virus's DNA is resistant. But wait, RNA viruses don't have DNA; they have RNA. So H might not apply.

Option I says the virus has DNA but DNAase only works in bacteria. That's not accurate because DNAase should work on any DNA, regardless of the source.

Option J says the virus has DNA and is not affected. But again, RNA viruses don't have DNA; they have RNA.

So, the correct answer must be C: the virus contains RNA, so it's not affected by DNAase.

The correct answer is C: The virus contains RNA, it is not affected by DNAase.
