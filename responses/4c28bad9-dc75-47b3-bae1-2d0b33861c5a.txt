Okay, so I've got this problem here about finding the capacitance needed to resonate a coil at a certain frequency. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The question says: How much capacitance is required to resonate a coil of 0.001 mH at a frequency of 2 MHz? The options are from A to J, all in pF. Hmm, right, I remember that resonance in LC circuits involves inductance and capacitance. 

Wait, the formula for resonance frequency in an LC circuit is f = 1/(2π√(LC)). Oh right, that's the formula. So I need to solve for C, the capacitance. 

Let me jot that down: f = 1/(2π√(LC)). Rearranging for C, I get C = 1/( (2πf)^2 * L ). 

Wait, let me check that again. Starting with f = 1/(2π√(LC)), so squaring both sides gives f² = 1/(4π²LC). Then rearranging for C: C = 1/(4π² f² L). Yep, that's right.

Now, plug in the values. The coil inductance L is 0.001 mH. Wait, mH is millihenries, so that's 0.001 * 10^-3 H, which is 1e-6 H. Oh wait, no, wait: 1 mH is 1e-3 H, so 0.001 mH is 1e-6 H, right? So L = 1e-6 H.

The frequency f is 2 MHz. MHz is megahertz, which is 1e6 Hz. So 2 MHz is 2e6 Hz.

Plugging into the formula: C = 1/(4 * π² * (2e6)^2 * 1e-6 ). Let me calculate each part step by step.

First, calculate (2e6)^2. That's (2e6)*(2e6) = 4e12. 

Then, multiply by L, which is 1e-6 H: 4e12 * 1e-6 = 4e6.

Next, multiply by 4π². π is approximately 3.1416, so π² is about 9.8696. Then 4 * 9.8696 ≈ 39.4784.

So now, 39.4784 multiplied by 4e6 is 39.4784 * 4e6. Let me compute that: 39.4784 *4 is 157.9136, so 157.9136e6. Wait, that can't be right because then 1 divided by that would be a very small number. Wait, maybe I messed up the order of operations.

Wait, the formula is C = 1/(4π² f² L). So 4π² f² L is the denominator. Let me compute denominator step by step.

Compute f²: (2e6)^2 = 4e12 Hz².

Multiply by L: 4e12 * 1e-6 H = 4e6 (H·Hz²). Wait, H is henries, Hz is per second. So H·Hz² is (H·s^-2). Hmm, not sure about the units, but let's proceed numerically.

Then multiply by 4π²: 4 * π² ≈ 39.4784. So 39.4784 * 4e6 = 157,913,600 (approx 1.579136e8).

Wait, that's 1.579136e8. So then, C = 1 / 1.579136e8 ≈ 6.33e-9 Farads. Because 1/(1.579e8) is approximately 6.33e-9 F.

Wait, 6.33e-9 F is the same as 6,330 pF because 1 pF is 1e-12 F, so 6.33e-9 F is 6,330e-12 F = 6,330 pF.

Looking at the options, option F is 6,330 pF. So the answer should be F.

To find the capacitance required to resonate a 0.001 mH coil at 2 MHz, use the resonance formula \( f = \frac{1}{2\pi\sqrt{LC}} \). Rearranging for \( C \), we get \( C = \frac{1}{4\pi^2 f^2 L} \). Substituting \( L = 1 \mu H \) and \( f = 2 \text{ MHz} \), the calculation yields \( C \approx 6.33 \text{ nF} \), which is equivalent to 6,330 pF. 

Answer: F
