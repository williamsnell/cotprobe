Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about contractionary monetary policy in the short run. I'm a bit rusty on my economics, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

First, what's contractionary monetary policy? From what I remember, monetary policy involves actions taken by a country's central bank to influence the economy. Contractionary monetary policy is when they try to reduce the money supply in the economy. The idea is to make borrowing more expensive, which slows down spending and investment. This is usually done to control inflation when the economy is overheating.

So, the question is asking what happens to aggregate demand, output, and the price level in the short run when contractionary monetary policy is implemented.

Let me break it down. Aggregate demand (AD) is the total demand for final goods and services in an economy at a given price level. If the central bank reduces the money supply, interest rates would rise because there's less money available for lending. Higher interest rates make borrowing more expensive, which can lead businesses to reduce investment and consumers to spend less because loans are harder or more costly. So, if both businesses and consumers are spending less, the overall aggregate demand should decrease.

Next, output, which refers to the real GDP or the actual quantity of goods and services produced. If aggregate demand decreases, businesses might produce less because there's lower demand for their products. So, output should decrease as well.

Now, what about the price level? If the economy's demand is lower and output is lower, what does that mean for prices? Well, if the demand for goods and services decreases, and supply is also decreasing (because output is down), the effect on prices can be a bit tricky. But in contractionary monetary policy, the main goal is to reduce inflation. So, if inflation was high, contractionary measures would bring the price level down. Alternatively, if the economy was facing demand-pull inflation, reducing demand would lower prices.

So putting it all together: contractionary monetary policy leads to a decrease in aggregate demand, which in turn causes output to decrease and the price level to decrease as well.

Looking at the options, I need to find the option where all three are decreasing. Let's look at the options:

A: Decreases      Stays the same      Decreases → No, because output stays the same.

B: Increases      Decreases      Increases → No, AD increases doesn't make sense.

C: Increases      Increases      Increases → No, contractionary should decrease AD.

D: Decreases      Decreases      Increases → No, price level increases? That doesn't fit.

E: Stays the same      Decreases      Decreases → AD stays same? Doesn't seem right.

F: Decreases      Increases      Decreases → Output increases? Doesn't align.

G: Increases      Increases      Decreases → AD increases? No.

H: Decreases      Increases      Increases → Output increases? Confusing.

I: Decreases      Decreases      Decreases → All three decrease. This matches my reasoning.

J: Increases      Decreases      Decreases → AD increases? No.

So the correct answer should be I: All three decrease.

In the short run, contractionary monetary policy reduces the money supply, leading to higher interest rates, decreased investment, and lower consumer spending, which lowers aggregate demand (AD). With lower AD, businesses produce less, reducing output (GDP). Lower demand also helps bring down the price level, especially if inflation was a concern. Therefore, all three—aggregate demand, output, and price level—decrease.

Answer: I
