G: Pre-experimental
H: Experimental
I: Longitudinal
J: Case study

Okay, so I need to figure out which research design allows a researcher to examine both age and cohort differences. The options given are from A to J. Let me think about each one.

First, I remember that age differences typically involve looking at how people change as they get older, which would be a longitudinal study. Cohort differences refer to the effects of the generation someone belongs to, like how different generations might have different experiences or behaviors.

Looking at the options:

A: Ethnographic - That's more about observing cultural practices, not really about age or cohorts.

B: Cross-sequential - Hmm, cross-sequential... I think that involves looking at different age groups at the same time and then following them over time. So it combines cross-sectional and longitudinal aspects. That might allow the researcher to see both age-related changes and cohort effects because they're looking at multiple groups across different times.

C: Cross-sectional - This is when you study different age groups at one point in time. It can show age differences but doesn't track cohorts over time, so it might not capture cohort effects well.

D: Quasi-experimental - These are similar to experiments but without random assignment. Not sure if it's about age and cohort.

E: Phenomenological - Focuses on understanding experiences from a subjective perspective, not really about age or cohorts.

F: Correlational - Looks at relationships between variables, but doesn't manipulate variables or track changes over time for cohorts.

G: Pre-experimental - These are early stages of experiments, not specifically designed for age or cohort analysis.

H: Experimental - Typically involves control groups and interventions, not directly about age or cohort differences.

I: Longitudinal - This is about tracking the same group over time, so it's good for age changes but might not capture cohort differences if the groups are the same.

J: Case study - In-depth look at a specific case, not suited for examining age or cohort trends across larger groups.

So putting it together, Cross-sequential (B) seems to fit because it looks at different age groups at different times, allowing the researcher to disentangle age effects from cohort effects. That makes sense because a cross-sectional study only gives a snapshot, while longitudinal follows one cohort. Cross-sequential combines multiple cross-sections over time, so it can capture both age and cohort variations.

The correct answer is B: Cross-sequential. This design allows the researcher to examine both age differences and cohort effects by studying different age groups across multiple time points, thereby combining cross-sectional and longitudinal approaches.

Answer: B
