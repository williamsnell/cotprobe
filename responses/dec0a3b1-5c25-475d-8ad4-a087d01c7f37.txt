Okay, so I have this question about westward migration in the 1840s, and I need to figure out which change is most likely to have occurred. The question gives a quote from John L. O'Sullivan in 1839, which talks about the future of the United States as a great nation. I'm not sure if that quote is directly relevant, but maybe it's about the expansionist ideas during that time.

Looking at the options, I need to think about what was happening in the 1840s regarding westward migration. I remember that the 1840s were a time of significant expansion for the United States. There was the Oregon Territory, which was a big area that included present-day Oregon, Washington, Idaho, and parts of Montana and Wyoming. People were moving there because of the promise of land and the idea of Manifest Destiny.

Then there's California. In 1848, gold was discovered at Sutter's Mill, leading to the California Gold Rush of 1849. That must have had a huge impact on migration. Before the Gold Rush, people were heading to Oregon, but once gold was found, a lot more people would have started moving westward, especially to California.

So, the question is about the 1840s. Let me think about when the Gold Rush happened. It started in 1848 and peaked in 1849. So during the 1840s, the latter part of the decade would have seen an increase in migration towards California. Before that, maybe more people were going to Oregon. So in the 1840s, I think the number of pioneers going to Oregon might have increased, but then after the Gold Rush started, the focus shifted to California.

Wait, but the question is about which change occurred during the 1840s. So in the early 1840s, before the Gold Rush, maybe migration to Oregon was high. Then, in the late 1840s, when the Gold Rush hit, more people went to California. So overall, during the 1840s, there's a shift from Oregon to California.

Looking at the options:

A: Oregon increased, California decreased. That doesn't seem right because the Gold Rush would have increased California.

B: First wave ended, low migrants until after Civil War. I don't think migration was that low; the Gold Rush was a big wave.

C: Oregon decreased, California increased. That makes sense because the Gold Rush caused a shift towards California.

D: Native Americans moving east. I don't recall that being a major trend; more likely, they were being pushed west or forced into reservations.

E: Both same. Unlikely because of the Gold Rush.

F: Steady migration. No, because Gold Rush caused a surge.

G: First settling west of Mississippi. That's not true because many were already there before.

H: Gold Rush caused decrease in migration. No, the opposite happened.

I: Settling in the East. No, people were moving West, not East.

J: Free blacks moving West. I don't think that was a major factor in the 1840s; maybe more in later periods.

So the correct answer should be C: The number of pioneers headed for the Oregon territory decreased while the number headed for California greatly increased. This aligns with the Gold Rush of 1849 attracting more people to California, possibly diverting some who were initially heading to Oregon.

The 1840s marked a significant shift in westward migration in the United States, particularly influenced by the California Gold Rush of 1849. Prior to the Gold Rush, migration to the Oregon Territory was substantial due to its reputation as a land of opportunity. However, the discovery of gold in California led to a massive influx of pioneers heading west, causing a noticeable decrease in migration to Oregon as people shifted their focus to California. This change aligns with the idea of Manifest Destiny and the pursuit of economic opportunity during the decade.

Answer: C
