Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the temperature of a fireball in a thermonuclear explosion and finding the corresponding lambda max. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

First, the question says the temperature is approximately 10^7 K. I remember that in thermal physics, the peak wavelength of emitted radiation from a blackbody is related to its temperature by something called Wien's Law. Oh right, Wien's Displacement Law states that lambda_max multiplied by the temperature T equals a constant. I think that constant is about 2.898 × 10^-3 m·K. Yeah, I'm pretty sure that's right.

So the formula should be lambda_max = (Wien's constant) / T. Let me write that down: λ_max = (2.898e-3 m·K) / T. Plugging in T as 1e7 K. Let me calculate that.

Wait, let me make sure I remember the formula correctly. Yes, it's lambda_max * T = 2.898e-3, so lambda_max is that constant divided by T. Got it.

Calculating: 2.898e-3 divided by 1e7. Let me do the math. 2.898e-3 is the same as 0.002898. Divided by 10,000,000 (which is 1e7). So 0.002898 / 1e7 = 2.898e-10 meters. Wait, because 0.002898 is 2.898e-3, so 2.898e-3 / 1e7 is 2.898e-10. So lambda_max is approximately 2.898e-10 m.

Looking at the options, I need to see which one is closest to that value. Let's check the options:

A: 2e-10 m
B: 1e-10 m
C:7e-10 m
D:6e-10 m
E:4e-10 m
F:0.5e-10 m
G:8e-10 m
H:3e-10 m
I:5e-10 m
J:2.5e-10 m

Hmm, my calculation gives around 2.9e-10 m. The closest option is A: 2e-10 m, but wait, 2.9 is closer to 3e-10, but I don't see a 3e-10 option. Oh wait, H is 3e-10 m. So why isn't H an option? Let me double-check my calculation.

Wait, wait a second. Did I remember the Wien's constant correctly? Let me confirm. Yes, I think it's approximately 2.8977719e-3 m·K, so 2.898e-3 is accurate enough. So 2.898e-3 divided by 1e7 equals 2.898e-10 m, which is approximately 2.9e-10 m.

Looking back at the options, the closest one is A: 2e-10, but wait, H is 3e-10. Oh, but 2.9 is almost 3. So perhaps the intended answer is H, which is 3e-10 m. But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me re-calculate. 2.898e-3 divided by 1e7 equals 2.898e-10 m. That's correct. So 2.898e-10 is approximately 2.9e-10 m. The options are in increments, so the closest is either 2e-10 (A) or 3e-10 (H). But 2.9 is closer to 3 than to 2. So maybe the answer is H, but wait, none of the options have exactly 3. Hmm, maybe I should look again.

Wait, looking at the options again, option H is 3e-10. So that's the closest. But wait, I remember sometimes in such problems, the approximation might be taken as 3e-10 m for 1e7 K. Alternatively, perhaps the value used for Wien's constant is 3e-3 m·K, which would make lambda_max = 3e-3 / 1e7 = 3e-10 m. So maybe the intended answer is H: 3e-10 m.

But in my precise calculation, it's about 2.9e-10, so closer to 3e-10 than 2e-10. So I think the correct answer is H. Wait, but looking at the options, H is 3e-10, which is option H. So the answer should be H.

Wait, but the options don't list H as 3e-10? Wait, looking back at the options:

Wait the user listed the options as:

Options:

A: 2 10^{-10} m

B: 1 10^{-10} m

C:7 10^{-10} m

D:6 10^{-10} m

E:4 10^{-10} m

F:0.5 10^{-10} m

G:8 10^{-10} m

H: 3 10^{-10} m

I:5 10^{-10} m

J:2.5 10^{-10} m

Yes, so H is 3e-10 m. So my calculation gives 2.898e-10, which is approximately 2.9e-10, which is closer to 3e-10 than 2e-10. So the correct answer should be H. But wait, the options don't have H as 3e-10, wait no, H is 3e-10.

Wait, but in the initial calculation, I thought A was 2e-10. So why is the correct answer H? Because 2.9 is closer to 3 than to 2. So the answer is H.

The temperature of the fireball in a thermonuclear explosion is approximately \(10^7 \mathrm{~K}\). Using Wien's Displacement Law, \(\lambda_{\max} = \frac{2.898 \times 10^{-3} \mathrm{~m \cdot K}}{T}\), we calculate:

\[
\lambda_{\max} = \frac{2.898 \times 10^{-3}}{10^7} = 2.898 \times 10^{-10} \mathrm{~m}.
\]

This value is approximately \(2.9 \times 10^{-10} \mathrm{~m}\), which is closest to \(3 \times 10^{-10} \mathrm{~m}\). Among the given options, the closest match is **H: \(3 \times 10^{-10} \mathrm{~m}\)**.
