Okay, so I have this physics problem here about interference patterns with a double star observed using a telescope and a double slit. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The problem says that as the distance between the centers of the double slit is increased, the fringes disappear when that distance is 57.5 cm. I remember that when the fringes disappear, it's probably because the interference condition is no longer met, maybe something to do with the path difference being too large. Oh wait, that's when the path difference equals the wavelength, but I'm not sure.

Wait, no, when the slit separation is increased until the fringes vanish, that might mean that the interference becomes unobservable because the path difference is a multiple of the wavelength, causing constructive interference everywhere, but that's for thin films. Maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, the setup is a double star observed with a double slit. So the telescope is focused on the double star, which has two components separated by some angular separation. When you place a double slit in front of the objective, you're introducing an interference pattern. The fringes disappear when the slit separation is such that the condition for constructive interference is met in a way that the path difference cancels the star's separation.

Wait, the general formula for interference in a double slit is that the path difference d sinθ = mλ, where d is the slit separation, θ is the angle from the central maximum, m is the order, and λ is the wavelength.

But in this case, when the fringes disappear, maybe the condition is that the path difference equals the separation between the two stars. So the angular separation would be when d sinθ equals λ/(d slit?), no, wait.

Wait, when the fringes vanish, it's because the path difference from the two slits is equal to the separation of the two stars, making the interference pattern collapse. Or perhaps when the slit separation is such that the interference pattern's fringe spacing corresponds to the star's separation.

Alternatively, I think the key here is that when the fringes disappear, the condition is that the slit separation D is equal to the wavelength divided by the angular separation. Or maybe D times sinθ equals λ. Wait, let's think again.

The double star has two components separated by an angle θ. When the telescope observes them, the light from each star component goes through the double slit. The condition for constructive interference (bright fringes) is that the path difference from the two slits must be an integer multiple of the wavelength. But if the slit separation D is large enough, the path difference between the two stars might cause the fringes to shift beyond detection, making them disappear.

Wait, perhaps when the fringes disappear, the condition is that the slit separation D is such that D λ = 2 d, where d is the slit separation. No, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, another approach. The formula for the fringe spacing in a double slit is y = (λ L) / d, where L is the distance from the slits to the screen. But in this case, the telescope's objective is acting as the screen? No, wait, the telescope is observing the stars, so L would be the distance from the slit to the objective. But I'm not sure if that's relevant here.

Wait, the problem is about the angular separation θ of the two stars. The condition that causes the fringes to disappear would be when the path difference between the two stars through the double slit is equal to the wavelength. Because if the path difference is an exact multiple of the wavelength, you get constructive interference, but if it's more than that, perhaps the fringes can't be resolved, so they disappear. Hmm, maybe not.

Alternatively, the condition for the fringes to disappear is when the slit separation D is equal to the wavelength divided by the angular separation θ. So D = λ / θ. But I'm not sure about that.

Wait, let me think about the formula. The angular separation θ is related to the slit separation D and the wavelength λ. I think the formula is θ = λ / D. Because when the slit separation D increases, the angular separation θ decreases, which makes sense because the fringes would be closer together.

Wait, wait, no. The fringe spacing on the screen is y = (λ L) / D, where L is the distance from the slits to the screen. But the angular separation would be θ ≈ y / L = λ / D. So θ = λ / D. That makes sense because larger D (slit separation) leads to smaller θ (fringes closer together).

In this problem, when the fringes disappear, it's because the slit separation D has been increased to the point where the condition for interference is such that the fringes can't be seen. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps when D equals λ / θ, the fringes vanish because the interference pattern becomes such that the path difference equals the separation of the stars.

Wait, but the problem states that the fringes disappear when D is 57.5 cm. So I think the formula is θ = λ / D. Let me plug in the numbers.

Wait, λ is given as 5550 Å. Wait, 1 Å is 1e-10 meters. So 5550 Å = 5550e-10 m = 5.55e-7 m.

D is 57.5 cm, which is 0.575 meters.

So θ = λ / D = (5.55e-7 m) / (0.575 m) = approximately 9.65e-7 radians.

Now, I need to convert radians to seconds of arc. I know that 1 radian is approximately 57.3 degrees, and 1 degree is 60 minutes, and 1 minute is 60 seconds. So 1 radian = 57.3 * 60 * 60 = 206265 seconds of arc.

So θ in seconds of arc is (9.65e-7 rad) * 206265 ≈ 0.2 seconds of arc.

Wait, let me calculate that more accurately.

9.65e-7 * 206265 = ?

Let's compute 9.65e-7 * 2e5 = approx 0.193, but wait, 206265 is approximately 2.06265e5. So 9.65e-7 * 2.06265e5 = 9.65 * 2.06265 * 1e-2.

9.65 * 2.06265 ≈ Let's compute 9 * 2.06265 = 18.56385, 0.65 * 2.06265 ≈ 1.3407, total ≈ 19.9045. So 19.9045e-2 = 0.199045 seconds of arc, approximately 0.2 seconds.

Looking at the options, option J is 0.2 seconds of arc, option A is 0.35, option I is 0.3, etc.

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in the formula. Because when the fringes disappear, perhaps the condition is that D is equal to λ/θ, but maybe I should use θ = λ/(D * 2), or something else.

Wait, another thought: when the fringes disappear, it's because the separation D of the double slit is such that the interference condition can no longer be resolved. The resolving power of the telescope is related to the diffraction limit, but I'm not sure if that's applicable here.

Alternatively, perhaps the condition is that the slit separation D times the angular separation θ equals the wavelength. So D * θ = λ. So θ = λ / D.

Which brings us back to the same calculation. So θ = 5550 Å / 57.5 cm.

Wait, but wait, 57.5 cm is 0.575 meters, and 5550 Å is 5.55e-7 meters.

So θ = (5.55e-7 m) / (0.575 m) = 9.65e-7 radians.

Convert to arcseconds: 9.65e-7 * (180/pi) * 3600 ≈ 9.65e-7 * 2.06265e5 ≈ 0.199 arcseconds, which is approximately 0.2 arcseconds.

Looking back at the options, J is 0.2, so I think that's the answer.

The problem involves determining the angular separation of a double star when the fringes disappear due to an adjustable double slit. The key relationship is that the angular separation θ is given by θ = λ / D, where λ is the wavelength of light and D is the slit separation. Substituting the given values (λ = 5550 Å = 5.55 × 10⁻⁷ m and D = 57.5 cm = 0.575 m), the calculation yields θ ≈ 0.2 arcseconds. This matches option J.
