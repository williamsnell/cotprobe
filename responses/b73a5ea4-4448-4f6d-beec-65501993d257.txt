Okay, let's try to solve this problem. So, we have two similar polygons, ACDF and VWYZ. Similar polygons mean their corresponding sides are proportional. I remember that if two polygons are similar, the ratios of their corresponding sides are equal. 

First, I need to figure out which sides correspond to each other. The names of the polygons are ACDF and VWYZ. Let me list the vertices in order for both. For ACDF, the vertices are A, C, D, F. For VWYZ, the vertices are V, W, Y, Z. Hmm, wait, that seems a bit confusing because the order matters for correspondence. 

Wait, polygons are similar if their corresponding angles are equal and sides are in proportion. So, the order of the letters matters. ACDF is the first polygon, so A corresponds to V, C corresponds to W, D corresponds to Y, and F corresponds to Z. So the sides would correspond as follows: AC corresponds to VW, CD corresponds to WY, DF corresponds to YZ, and FA corresponds to ZV. 

Wait, but the problem gives me AF, CD, YZ, YW, and ZV. Let me note down the given lengths:

- AF = 12
- CD = 9
- YZ = 10
- YW = 6
- ZV = 3y - 1

Wait, AF is a side in polygon ACDF. Since the correspondence is A→V, C→W, D→Y, F→Z, AF would be the side from F back to A, which is F→A. So AF corresponds to ZV in the other polygon because Z is the last vertex and V is the first. So AF corresponds to ZV. 

Similarly, CD in ACDF is the side from C to D, which corresponds to WY in VWYZ. Because C→W, D→Y, so CD corresponds to WY. 

Wait, but the problem gives YW as 6. YW would be the side from Y to W, which is the reverse of WY. But since we are talking about the length of the side, the direction doesn't matter. So WY is the same as YW, which is 6. 

So, CD corresponds to WY, and CD is 9, WY is 6. So the ratio of the sides from ACDF to VWYZ is 9/6, which simplifies to 3/2. So the scale factor is 3/2. 

Wait, but wait, when polygons are similar, the ratio could be either ACDF to VWYZ or the other way around. So I need to make sure which one is which. The problem says ACDF is similar to VWYZ, so ACDF : VWYZ. So the scale factor is 3/2. That means each side in ACDF is 1.5 times the corresponding side in VWYZ. 

Wait, but AF is 12, which corresponds to ZV. So AF = 12, and ZV is given as 3y -1. So AF corresponds to ZV. So AF / ZV = scale factor. 

Wait, no. If ACDF is similar to VWYZ, then ACDF's sides multiplied by the scale factor give VWYZ's sides. So, the scale factor from ACDF to VWYZ is 3/2 because CD in ACDF is 9, and WY in VWYZ is 6. So 9 corresponds to 6, which is 9/6 = 3/2. So the scale factor is 3/2. 

Therefore, AF in ACDF is 12, which corresponds to ZV in VWYZ. So ZV would be AF divided by the scale factor. So ZV = AF / (scale factor) = 12 / (3/2) = 12 * (2/3) = 8. 

Wait, but ZV is given as 3y -1. So 3y -1 = 8. Solving for y: 3y = 8 +1 =9 → y = 9/3 =3. 

Wait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't mix up the ratios. If ACDF is similar to VWYZ, then each side of ACDF is (3/2) times the corresponding side in VWYZ. So AF in ACDF is 12, which would be (3/2) times ZV. So 12 = (3/2) * ZV → ZV = 12 * (2/3) =8. So ZV =8. 

Given that ZV =3y -1, so 3y -1 =8 →3y=9 → y=3. So the value of y is 3. Looking at the options, E is 3. So the answer should be E. 

Wait, let me check another side to confirm. For example, CD is 9 in ACDF, which corresponds to WY of 6 in VWYZ. So ratio is 9:6 or 3:2, which is 3/2. So AF is 12, and ZV is 8, which is 12/(3/2)=8, correct. 

Alternatively, if I thought the scale factor was from VWYZ to ACDF, then 6/9=2/3, which would be 2/3. Then AF would be ZV * (2/3), so 12= ZV*(2/3) → ZV=18. But then 3y-1=18 →3y=19 →y=19/3≈6.333, which isn't an option. So that can't be right. So the correct scale factor is 3/2. 

Another check: YZ is given as 10. YZ is a side in VWYZ. Which side does it correspond to in ACDF? Let's see, Y is the third vertex in VWYZ, so D is the third in ACDF. So YZ corresponds to DF. So DF in ACDF is YZ multiplied by the scale factor. Wait, no: ACDF is similar to VWYZ, so DF in ACDF corresponds to YZ in VWYZ. So DF = YZ * (scale factor) = 10 * (3/2) =15. But the problem doesn't give DF, so that's fine. 

So, calculations all point to y=3. So I think the correct answer is E.

The polygons ACDF and VWYZ are similar, meaning their corresponding sides are proportional. Given that AF = 12 and CD = 9 correspond to ZV and WY respectively, the scale factor from ACDF to VWYZ is 3/2. Using this, ZV is calculated as 8, leading to the equation 3y - 1 = 8. Solving for y gives y = 3.

Answer: E
