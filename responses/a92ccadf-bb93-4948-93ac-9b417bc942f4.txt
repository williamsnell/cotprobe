<think>
Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem is about the SLAC accelerator, which accelerates electrons to a certain energy. The question has two parts, (a) and (b). Let me read them again.

(a) asks how many electrons arrive at the target each second. So, I think this is about finding the number of electrons per second, which relates to current. 

(b) asks for the energy deposited in the target each second, which I believe is about power, since energy per second is power.

The given data:
- The accelerator can give electrons an energy of 4 × 10^10 eV.
- The current corresponds to 6 × 10^5 A.

Wait, wait. Wait, the current is given as 6 × 10^5 A? That's 600,000 Amperes? That seems extremely high, but maybe that's correct in the context of an accelerator.

Let me start with part (a).

I remember that electric current (I) is the rate of flow of charge. The formula is I = Q/t, where Q is charge and t is time. Since we're dealing with per second, the charge per second would be in coulombs.

Each electron has a charge of -1.6 × 10^-19 coulombs. So, if I can find out how many electrons pass a point each second, that's the number we're looking for in part (a).

So, rearranging I = Q/t, we get Q = I * t. But since we're looking for electrons per second, t is 1 second, so Q is I * 1 = I coulombs per second.

But wait, no, because Q is the total charge, which is the number of electrons multiplied by the charge per electron. So, the number of electrons per second (let's call it N) is N = I / (e), where e is the elementary charge.

So, N = I / e.

Given I is 6 × 10^5 A, and e is 1.6 × 10^-19 C. So, N = (6e5) / (1.6e-19) electrons per second.

Let me compute that:

6e5 = 6 × 10^5
1.6e-19 = 1.6 × 10^-19

Dividing them: (6 / 1.6) × (10^5 / 10^-19) = (3.75) × 10^(5 +19) )= 3.75 × 10^24 electrons per second? Wait, that can't be right because looking at the options, the highest is 9e16, which is way lower. Hmm, did I make a mistake?

Wait, wait. Wait, no, 6e5 is 600,000 A. Wait, that's a huge current, but perhaps it's correct. Let me compute 6e5 divided by 1.6e-19.

Let me compute 6 / 1.6 first. 6 divided by 1.6 is 3.75. Then, 10^5 divided by 10^-19 is 10^(5+19) = 10^24. So, 3.75e24 electrons per second. But looking at the options, none of them go that high. The highest option for (a) is H: 9e16. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, maybe I misread the current. Let me check the problem again. It says the current is 6 × 10^5 A. Oh wait, 6e5 is 600,000 A. That's correct, but the options don't go that high. So perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait another thought: Wait, perhaps the current given is the beam's current, but perhaps I should consider the charge per electron and the energy per electron to find power, but maybe I'm mixing up things.

Wait, let me try again. So, the current I is 6 × 10^5 A. Each second, that's 6e5 C/s. Each electron has a charge of 1.6e-19 C. So the number of electrons per second (n) is I / e = (6e5) / (1.6e-19) = (6/1.6) * 1e5 / 1e-19 = 3.75 * 1e24 electrons/s. But that's 3.75e24, which isn't any of the options. So I must have done something wrong.

Wait, perhaps the current is 6 × 10^-5 A? Because 6e-5 A would make more sense with the options. Let me check the question again. Oh, no, the question says 6 × 10^5 A. So that's correct.

Wait, maybe I misapplied the formula. Let me think again: Current I = charge per time. So, I = n * e, where n is number of electrons per second. So, n = I / e = (6e5 A) / (1.6e-19 C/electron). So, yes, 6e5 / 1.6e-19 = 3.75e24 electrons/s. That's way bigger than any option. So perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, perhaps the energy per electron is given, but that's part (b). Let me check part (b) to see if it helps.

Part (b) asks for the energy deposited in the target each second, in joules. So that's power, which would be energy per second. Power P is also given by P = I * V, but here, perhaps each electron has energy E, so total energy per second is n * E, where E is the energy per electron.

Wait, E is given as 4 × 10^10 eV per electron. So each electron has that energy. So the energy per second would be n * E, where n is the number from part (a).

So if I can find n from part (a), then multiply by E to get power.

But from part (a), my calculation gives n as 3.75e24 electrons/s, but none of the options for (a) are this high. So perhaps I made a mistake in the current value. Wait, maybe the current is 6 × 10^-5 A. Let me check.

Wait, the problem says "6 x 10^5 A", so 6e5 A. That's correct.

Wait, perhaps the current is 6 × 10^5 electrons per second? No, that's not right because current is in Amperes, which is coulombs per second, so 1 A = 1 C/s, and each electron is 1.6e-19 C. So, perhaps I should compute n as I/(e), which is 6e5/(1.6e-19)=3.75e24 electrons/s. But this is way higher than even the highest option for (a), which is H:9e16. So I'm definitely doing something wrong.

Wait, perhaps the current is 6 × 10^-5 A? Let me see. If the current were 6e-5 A, then n would be (6e-5)/(1.6e-19) = (6/1.6) * 1e-5 / 1e-19 = 3.75 * 1e14 = 3.75e14 electrons/s. Hmm, looking at the options, option C is 3.75e14 for (a), and part (b) is 2.4e6 J/s. Let me check that.

Wait, but the problem states the current is 6 × 10^5 A, so that can't be. Unless perhaps I made a mistake in reading the exponent. Let me go back.

The problem says: "6 x 10^5 A". So yes, 6e5 A.

Wait, perhaps the accelerator's energy is 4 × 10^10 eV per electron, and the current is 6e5 A. So, for part (b), the energy per second would be (number of electrons per second) × (energy per electron in joules).

So, first, let me compute the energy per electron in joules. Since 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J, so 4e10 eV is 4e10 * 1.602e-19 J.

Calculating that: 4e10 * 1.602e-19 = (4 * 1.602) * 10^(10-19) = 6.408e-9 J per electron.

Now, if the number of electrons per second is n = I/(e) = 6e5 A / 1.6e-19 C/electron = (6e5)/(1.6e-19) = 3.75e24 electrons/s.

Then, energy per second (power) would be n * E = 3.75e24 * 6.408e-9 J.

Let me compute that: 3.75e24 * 6.408e-9 = (3.75 *6.408) * 1e15 = approx 24 * 1e15 = 2.4e16 J/s. But looking at the options, part (b) doesn't have anything that high. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I mixed up the exponents. Let's recalculate n again: 6e5 / 1.6e-19.

6e5 is 6 * 10^5.

1.6e-19 is 1.6 * 10^-19.

Dividing them: (6 / 1.6) * 10^(5 - (-19)) ) = 3.75 * 10^(24) electrons/s.

Hmm, that's correct. But the options don't have anything near that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, perhaps the current is given as the beam's current, but perhaps the energy per electron is 4e10 eV, and the question is about how much energy is delivered per second, which is power.

Wait, perhaps the approach is to compute power as current multiplied by voltage, but I don't have the voltage here. Alternatively, I can compute power as I * V, but without V, maybe I should use the energy per electron and the number of electrons per second.

Wait, but I have the energy per electron, and I can compute the number of electrons per second from the current, so that would give me the power.

But according to my calculations, n is 3.75e24 electrons/s, which is way higher than any option. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, perhaps the current is 6 × 10^5 electrons per second, which would make the current I = n * e. Let me compute that.

If n is 6e5 electrons/s, then I = 6e5 * 1.6e-19 C/s = 9.6e-14 A, which is way less than the given current of 6e5 A. So that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps the current is given as 6 × 10^5 A, which is correct, and the energy per electron is 4e10 eV. So, the energy per second (power) would be I * V, but I don't have the voltage. Alternatively, using the number of electrons per second multiplied by energy per electron.

But the problem is that my calculation for n is way too high. So maybe I should think that the current is 6 × 10^-5 A, not 6e5 A. Let's try that.

If I = 6e-5 A, then n = I/(e) = (6e-5)/(1.6e-19) = (6/1.6) * 1e-5 / 1e-19 = 3.75 * 1e14 = 3.75e14 electrons/s, which matches option C's part (a): 3.75e14 electrons/s.

Then, part (b): energy per second is n * E.

E per electron is 4e10 eV = 4e10 * 1.6e-19 J = 6.4e-9 J.

So, energy per second is 3.75e14 * 6.4e-9 = (3.75 * 6.4) * 1e5 = 24 * 1e5 = 2.4e6 J/s. Which matches option C's part (b): 2.4e6 J/s.

So, perhaps I made a mistake in reading the current exponent. The problem says 6 × 10^5 A, but maybe it's 6 × 10^-5 A. Alternatively, perhaps I should double-check the problem statement.

Wait, the problem says: "the number of electrons in the beam corresponds to a current of 6 x 10^5 A." So it's definitely 6e5 A.

But then, according to my calculation, the number of electrons per second is 3.75e24, which isn't any of the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait another thought: Maybe the energy per electron is 4e10 eV, but that's the kinetic energy. So the total power is the number of electrons per second multiplied by the energy per electron.

So, let's proceed again with the correct current.

n = I / e = (6e5 A) / (1.6e-19 C/electron) = (6e5) / (1.6e-19) = 3.75e24 electrons/s.

Energy per electron is 4e10 eV = 4e10 * 1.6e-19 J = 6.4e-9 J.

Power = n * E = 3.75e24 * 6.4e-9 = 2.4e16 J/s. But looking at the options, the highest part (b) is H:5.76e8 J/s. So this is way off.

Hmm, perhaps the current is actually 6 × 10^-5 A, which would give n = 3.75e14 electrons/s, matching option C. Then part (b) would be 2.4e6 J/s, which is option C's (b). So maybe the correct answer is option C.

But why did the problem say 6e5 A? That's a very high current. Maybe there's a typo, but given the options, option C fits if the current were 6e-5 A. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the energy given is per electron, and the current is in Amperes, so I should proceed differently.

Wait, the current is 6e5 A, so each second, 6e5 C of charge passes. Each electron has a charge of 1.6e-19 C, so the number of electrons per second is (6e5)/(1.6e-19) = 3.75e24 electrons/s. So part (a) would be 3.75e24, but none of the options match that.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy per electron is 4e10 eV, which is 4e10 * 1.6e-19 J = 6.4e-9 J per electron.

So, the power is 3.75e24 * 6.4e-9 = 2.4e16 J/s, which is way higher than any option.

So, perhaps I'm missing a key point here. Maybe the current is 6e5 A, but the energy per electron is 4e10 eV. So, the total power is I * voltage. But I don't have the voltage, so I can't use that approach.

Alternatively, maybe I should compute the number of electrons per second as I/(e), which is 6e5 / 1.6e-19 = 3.75e24, but this isn't among the options. Therefore, perhaps the correct approach is to look for a different way.

Wait, perhaps the question is mixing up energy and current. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the energy per electron is 4e10 eV, which is 4e10 * 1.6e-19 J = 6.4e-9 J per electron. The current is 6e5 A, which is 6e5 C/s. So, the number of electrons per second is 6e5 / (1.6e-19) = 3.75e24.

Multiply by energy per electron: 3.75e24 * 6.4e-9 = 2.4e16 J/s. But that's not in the options.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate part (b) as I * voltage, but I don't have voltage. Alternatively, perhaps the beam's energy is given, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the current is not the same as the number of electrons per second. Wait, no, current is the number multiplied by charge per electron.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the energy per electron is 4e10 eV, but that's their kinetic energy. So, the power is the number of electrons per second multiplied by that energy. So, let's proceed.

n = I / e = 6e5 / 1.6e-19 = 3.75e24 electrons/s.

E per electron = 4e10 eV = 4e10 * 1.6e-19 J = 6.4e-9 J.

Power = n * E = 3.75e24 * 6.4e-9 = 2.4e16 J/s.

But again, no option matches this. So perhaps I'm missing a step here.

Wait, perhaps the energy given is per electron, but the current is the number of electrons per second. So, if I is 6e5 A, then number of electrons per second is 6e5 / 1.6e-19 = 3.75e24, which is way off the options.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking about the number of electrons per second, which is part (a), and the energy per second in joules is part (b). Let me look at the options again.

Looking at the options, option B is (a)1.5e15, (b)9.6e7.

Wait, 1.5e15 electrons/s would imply I = n * e = 1.5e15 *1.6e-19 = 2.4e-4 A, which is 2.4e-4 A, which is way lower than the given 6e5 A. So that's not matching.

Option A: (a)2e15 e/s → I = 2e15 *1.6e-19 = 3.2e-4 A. Again, way lower than 6e5 A.

Option C: (a)3.75e14 e/s → I = 3.75e14 *1.6e-19 = 6e-5 A. So 6e-5 A is 0.00006 A, which is much less than 6e5 A.

Wait, but in this case, if the current is 6e5 A, then the only way that matches any option is if the current is 6e5, but the numbers in the options are way lower.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express 6e5 A in terms of the number of electrons per second. Let's compute n = I/(e) = 6e5 / 1.6e-19 = 3.75e24 electrons/s. But none of the options have that. So perhaps the answer isn't among the options, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in units. Let me check.

Wait, 1 A = 1 C/s.

Each electron has charge 1.6e-19 C.

So, number of electrons per second is I/(e) = (6e5 C/s) / (1.6e-19 C/electron) = 6e5 /1.6e-19 electrons/s.

Which is 6/1.6 = 3.75; 10^5 / 10^-19 = 10^24.

So 3.75e24 electrons/s.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I should look for the option where part (a) is 3.75e24, but that's not present.

Wait, perhaps the problem meant 6e-5 A, not 6e5 A. Because 6e-5 A would give n=3.75e14, which is option C.

So, perhaps it's a typo, and the correct current is 6e-5 A. Then, n=3.75e14, and part (b) would be 3.75e14 *6.4e-9 J = 2.4e6 J/s, which is option C.

So, the answer would be option C.

Alternatively, perhaps the current is 6e5 A, but the options have a typo. But given the options, option C seems to fit if the current were 6e-5 A.

Therefore, I'll proceed with option C as the answer.
</think>

The problem involves calculating the number of electrons arriving at the target per second and the energy deposited in the target each second for an electron beam with a given current and energy per electron.

### Part (a): Number of Electrons per Second
The current \( I \) is given as \( 6 \times 10^5 \, \text{A} \), and the charge of a single electron \( e \) is \( 1.6 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C} \). The number of electrons per second \( n \) is calculated using the formula:

\[
n = \frac{I}{e}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
n = \frac{6 \times 10^5}{1.6 \times 10^{-19}} = 3.75 \times 10^{24} \, \text{electrons/s}
\]

However, this result does not match any of the provided options. Upon re-evaluating the problem, it is possible that the current was intended to be \( 6 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{A} \) instead of \( 6 \times 10^5 \, \text{A} \). Using \( I = 6 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{A} \):

\[
n = \frac{6 \times 10^{-5}}{1.6 \times 10^{-19}} = 3.75 \times 10^{14} \, \text{electrons/s}
\]

This matches the value for part (a) in **Option C**.

### Part (b): Energy Deposited per Second
The energy per electron is given as \( 4 \times 10^{10} \, \text{eV} \). Converting this to joules:

\[
E = 4 \times 10^{10} \, \text{eV} \times 1.6 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J/eV} = 6.4 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{J}
\]

The energy deposited per second (power) is:

\[
P = n \times E
\]

Substituting \( n = 3.75 \times 10^{14} \, \text{electrons/s} \) and \( E = 6.4 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{J} \):

\[
P = 3.75 \times 10^{14} \times 6.4 \times 10^{-9} = 2.4 \times 10^{6} \, \text{J/s}
\]

This matches the value for part (b) in **Option C**.

### Conclusion
Given the provided options and the calculations, the correct answer is:

**C: (a) \( 3.75 \times 10^{14} \, \text{electrons/s} \), (b) \( 2.4 \times 10^{6} \, \text{J/s} \)**

ANSWER: C
