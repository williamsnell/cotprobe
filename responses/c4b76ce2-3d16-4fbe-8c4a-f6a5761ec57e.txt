Okay, so I have this thermodynamics problem here, and I need to find the change in enthalpy (ΔH) for a reaction at 25°C. The reaction given is CO(g) + (1/2)O₂(g) → CO₂(g), and the change in electric energy (ΔE) is provided as -67.4 kcal. Wait, no, wait—actually, I think the question mentions ΔE, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Oh wait, the question says "∆E = -67.4 Kcal." Hmm, but the reaction is about enthalpy, not electric energy. Maybe it's a typo, perhaps it's Gibbs free energy (ΔG) or something else. Or maybe it's a mistake, and it's supposed to be ΔH. I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, no, the question says "Calculate ∆H for the reaction at 25°C." So the given data is ∆E = -67.4 kcal. But that doesn't make much sense because usually, we talk about ∆H (enthalpy) and ∆G (Gibbs free energy). Electric energy isn't a standard term I'm familiar with in this context. Maybe it's a typo and they meant ΔG? Or perhaps it's a different term. Let me think.

At 25°C, which is 298 K, the relationship between ΔG and ΔH is given by the equation ΔG = ΔH - TΔS. But wait, the problem gives me ΔE, which I'm not sure about. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is referring to the change in internal energy (ΔU) instead of enthalpy. Because in thermodynamics, internal energy (U) and enthalpy (H) are related by H = U + PV. So ΔH = ΔU + Δ(PV), and for reactions at constant pressure, ΔH is the heat of reaction.

Wait, but the question gives ∆E. I'm a bit stuck. Let me re-read the problem. Oh wait, no, the problem says "∆E = -67.4 Kcal." But I'm trying to find ∆H. Maybe I need to relate ∆E to ∆H. Alternatively, perhaps it's a typo and they meant ∆U. Let's assume for a moment that ∆E is actually ∆U, the change in internal energy. Because otherwise, I don't know how to proceed with ∆E being given.

So, if ∆E is ∆U, then I can use the relation between ∆U and ∆H. The formula is ∆H = ∆U + ∆(PV). For gases, ∆(PV) is equal to the change in the number of moles times RT, because PV = nRT. So, ∆(PV) = (n_products - n_reactants) * RT.

Let's calculate the moles. The reaction is CO(g) + (1/2)O₂(g) → CO₂(g). So on the reactant side, we have 1 mole of CO and 0.5 moles of O₂, totaling 1.5 moles. On the product side, we have 1 mole of CO₂. So the change in moles (Δn) is 1 - 1.5 = -0.5 moles.

Now, R is the gas constant. But I need to make sure the units match. Since the given data is in kcal, I should use R in units compatible with kcal. R is 8.314 J/(mol·K), which is equivalent to approximately 0.001987 kcal/(mol·K). So R ≈ 1.987 × 10^-3 kcal/(mol·K).

The temperature T is 25°C, which is 298 K.

So, ∆(PV) = Δn × R × T = (-0.5 mol) × (0.001987 kcal/(mol·K)) × 298 K.

Let me compute that: 0.5 * 0.001987 = 0.0009935. Multiply by 298: 0.0009935 * 298 ≈ 0.2965 kcal. Since Δn is negative, ∆(PV) = -0.2965 kcal.

Now, if ∆H = ∆U + ∆(PV), and assuming ∆E is actually ∆U, then ∆H = (-67.4 kcal) + (-0.2965 kcal) ≈ -67.6965 kcal. Looking at the options, option C is -67.7 kcal, which is very close.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation. R is 0.001987 kcal/(mol·K), right? So 0.5 mol * 0.001987 kcal/(mol·K) = 0.0009935 kcal/K. Multiply by 298 K: 0.0009935 * 298 ≈ 0.296 kcal. So ∆(PV) is approximately -0.296 kcal.

So ∆H = ∆U + ∆(PV) = (-67.4) + (-0.296) ≈ -67.696 kcal, which rounds to -67.7 kcal. So the answer would be option C.

But wait, another thought: sometimes, ∆H is approximated as ∆E (internal energy) when the work is negligible, but in this case, we're accounting for the PV work. So I think the approach is correct.

Alternatively, if the problem indeed meant ∆G, then the formula would be ∆G = ∆H - T∆S. But without knowing ∆S, I can't find ∆H from that. So I think the initial approach is correct, assuming ∆E is ∆U.

The problem involves calculating the enthalpy change (∆H) for the reaction CO(g) + (1/2)O₂(g) → CO₂(g) at 25°C, given ∆E = -67.4 kcal. Assuming ∆E refers to the change in internal energy (∆U), the relationship between ∆H and ∆U is given by:

\[
\Delta H = \Delta U + \Delta (PV)
\]

The change in moles (Δn) is calculated as:

\[
\Delta n = \text{moles of products} - \text{moles of reactants} = 1 - 1.5 = -0.5 \, \text{mol}
\]

Using the ideal gas law, \( \Delta (PV) = \Delta n \cdot RT \), where \( R = 0.001987 \, \text{kcal/(mol·K)} \) and \( T = 298 \, \text{K} \):

\[
\Delta (PV) = (-0.5) \cdot (0.001987) \cdot 298 \approx -0.296 \, \text{kcal}
\]

Substituting into the equation for ∆H:

\[
\Delta H = \Delta U + \Delta (PV) = (-67.4) + (-0.296) \approx -67.7 \, \text{kcal}
\]

Thus, the closest answer is:

**C: -67.7 Kcal**
