Answer:
    
<think>
Okay, so I have this problem about propane combustion and calculating the dew point and mole fractions of the combustion products. Hmm, let me try to work through this step by step.

First, the reaction given is: C3H8 + 5O2 + 18.8N2 → 3CO2 + 4H2O + 18.8N2. Wait, that's interesting. So, the nitrogen from the air (which is 79% N2) is just passing through as an inert gas because it's not reacting. So the nitrogen on both sides is the same, 18.8 moles. That makes sense because in dry air, the nitrogen doesn't participate in the combustion reaction.

The problem states that propane is burning in dry 125% theoretical air. Oh right, theoretical air is the exact amount needed for complete combustion. So 125% means there's 25% more air than needed. This extra air means there's excess oxygen and nitrogen in the products.

I need to find two things: the dew point and the mole fractions of the combustion products. Let's tackle them one by one.

Starting with the mole fractions. To find these, I think I need to determine the total number of moles of all the products and then find each component's fraction.

Looking at the reaction, for every 1 mole of propane, we have 5 moles of O2 and 18.8 moles of N2 as reactants. The products are 3 moles of CO2, 4 moles of H2O, and 18.8 moles of N2.

Wait, so the N2 doesn't change because it's inert. So the moles of N2 in the products are the same as in the reactants.

Now, since the air is 125% of the theoretical amount, I need to calculate the actual moles of O2 and N2 used.

The theoretical air for propane (C3H8) is calculated based on the stoichiometric needs. The balanced equation is C3H8 + 5O2 → 3CO2 + 4H2O. So, for 1 mole of C3H8, we need 5 moles of O2. The theoretical air (which includes O2 and N2) is such that the O2 comes from the air. Since air is 21% O2, the theoretical air volume would be based on that.

Wait, but in this problem, the air is given as 125% of the theoretical. So, the actual O2 is 125% of the stoichiometric O2 needed.

Let me think differently. Let's assume we have 1 mole of propane. Then, the theoretical O2 required is 5 moles. The theoretical air would be 5 / 0.21 ≈ 23.81 moles of air. Because 21% of the air is O2, so to get 5 moles of O2, you need 5 / 0.21 ≈ 23.81 moles of air.

But since the air is 125% of theoretical, the actual air is 1.25 * 23.81 ≈ 29.76 moles of air.

In this actual air, the O2 is 21% of 29.76 ≈ 6.25 moles of O2. The N2 is 79% of 29.76 ≈ 23.52 moles of N2.

Wait, so when propane burns, the O2 is consumed, but since there's excess O2, the amount of O2 in the products will be the excess.

So, for 1 mole of C3H8, 5 moles of O2 are needed. But we have 6.25 moles of O2 provided. So the O2 consumed is 5, leaving 6.25 -5 =1.25 moles of O2 in the products.

The products are 3 CO2, 4 H2O, and the excess O2 and N2.

Wait, but in the reaction given, it's written as C3H8 +5O2 +18.8N2 → products. So perhaps in the given reaction, the moles are already assuming 18.8N2? Maybe I should approach this by considering the actual moles in the products.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute the total moles of each product and then calculate mole fractions.

Let me think again. Let's assume 1 mole of propane (C3H8) is burned.

The stoichiometric O2 needed is 5 moles. The theoretical air is (5 / 0.21) ≈23.81 moles of air, as before. So 125% of that is 29.76 moles of air.

In this 29.76 moles of air, the O2 is 29.76 *0.21 ≈6.25 moles, and N2 is 29.76 *0.79 ≈23.52 moles.

Now, when propane burns, it reacts with 5 moles of O2, leaving 6.25-5=1.25 moles of O2 in the products.

The products are:

- 3 moles CO2
- 4 moles H2O (which is liquid if the temperature is low, but since we're talking about dew point, probably in gas phase)
- 1.25 moles O2
- 23.52 moles N2

Wait, but the total moles in the products would be 3 +4 +1.25 +23.52 = 31.77 moles.

Wait, but in the reaction given, it's written as C3H8 +5O2 +18.8N2 → products. So perhaps the 18.8N2 is the N2 from the air. So maybe for 1 mole of propane, 18.8 moles of N2 are used, which would come from the air.

Wait, wait. Let me think: the theoretical air for 1 mole of propane is 5 moles O2 and the corresponding N2. Since air is 21% O2, 79% N2. So for 5 moles O2, the total air is 5 /0.21 ≈23.81 moles, as before. So in that, N2 is 23.81 *0.79 ≈18.76 moles, which is approximately 18.8 moles. So the reaction as given uses 5O2 and 18.8N2, which matches the theoretical air.

So when the air is 125% of theoretical, the actual air is 23.81 *1.25 ≈29.76 moles. So the O2 in the air is 29.76 *0.21 ≈6.25 moles, and N2 is 29.76 *0.79 ≈23.52 moles.

Now, when propane burns, it uses 5 moles of O2. So the O2 left is 6.25 -5 =1.25 moles.

The CO2 produced is 3 moles, H2O is 4 moles. But wait, H2O could be in gas or liquid form depending on temperature. Since the question is about the dew point, I think we're considering the H2O as a gas. Because the dew point is the temperature at which water vapor condenses into liquid. So if the temperature is below the dew point, water is liquid; above, it's gas. But for mole fractions, I think we assume all H2O is in the gas phase.

Wait, but the problem says "the combustion products", which would typically include all gases. So H2O is in gas phase. So it's 4 moles H2O vapor.

So the total moles in the products are:

CO2:3

H2O:4

O2:1.25

N2:23.52

Wait, but wait, in the reaction, the N2 is 18.8 moles on the reactant side. But when we have 125% air, the N2 is 23.52 moles. So in the products, N2 is 23.52 moles.

So total moles =3+4+1.25+23.52=31.77 moles.

Now, the mole fractions would be each component's moles divided by total moles.

Compute each:

CO2: 3 /31.77 ≈0.0945 → ~0.0945

H2O:4/31.77≈0.126 → ~0.126

O2:1.25/31.77≈0.0394 → ~0.0394

N2:23.52/31.77≈0.741 → ~0.741

Looking at the options, let's check option B: CO2 0.094, H2O 0.126, O2 0.04, N2 0.74.

That's close. Option B's O2 is 0.04, which is about 0.0394, so that's correct.

Now, the dew point. The dew point is the temperature at which water vapor starts to condense. To find this, we can use the Antoine equation for water, which relates vapor pressure to temperature.

The Antoine equation is:

log P = A - (B / (T + C))

Where P is the vapor pressure in mmHg, and T is in Celsius.

For water, the Antoine constants are approximately:

A = 8.14019
B = 1810.94
C = 244.485

Wait, but I think I might have the constants slightly off. Let me double-check. Another source says:

A = 8.14019
B = 1810.94
C = 244.485

Yes, that seems right.

The mole fraction of water is 0.126 (from the H2O mole fraction). The total pressure is 1 atm, which is 760 mmHg.

The partial pressure of water is (mole fraction) * total pressure.

So P_H2O = 0.126 *760 ≈95.76 mmHg.

Now, we can plug this into the Antoine equation to find the temperature T.

log P = 8.14019 - (1810.94 / (T +244.485))

We have P=95.76 mmHg.

So log(95.76) ≈1.9813.

So 1.9813 =8.14019 - (1810.94/(T+244.485))

Rearranging:

1810.94/(T+244.485) =8.14019 -1.9813 ≈6.1589

So T+244.485 =1810.94 /6.1589 ≈294.14

So T ≈294.14 -244.485 ≈49.655°C.

Convert to Fahrenheit: (49.655 * 9/5) +32 ≈ (89.179) +32≈121.18°F.

Wait, that's approximately 121°F. But looking at the options, none of them exactly match 121. Option F is 125°F, option G is 120°F, option J is 130°F, etc.

Hmm, maybe I made a miscalculation somewhere.

Wait, let me check the partial pressure calculation again. Mole fraction of H2O is 4/31.77≈0.126. So 0.126 *760 ≈95.76 mmHg. That's correct.

Wait, maybe the Antoine constants are different. Let me check another source. Some sources use different constants, perhaps for different temperature ranges.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the dew point formula differently. Another approach is to use the relation between relative humidity and dew point, but since we have the partial pressure, maybe using the Antoine equation is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the Clausius-Clapeyron equation, but that's more complicated.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Antoine equation. Let me check another set of Antoine constants for water. According to some sources, the constants are:

A = 8.14019
B = 1810.94
C = 244.485

Which is what I used earlier. So perhaps the calculation is correct.

So the dew point is approximately 49.65°C, which is 121.18°F. But looking at the options, the closest is option G, which has a dew point of 120°F, but its mole fractions don't match. Option F has 125°F, but the mole fractions are 0.092 CO2, 0.117 H2O, etc. Option B's dew point is 138°F, which is higher than our calculated 121. So none of the options exactly match this.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the mole fractions. Let me recheck.

Wait, I assumed 1 mole of propane. Let's see:

1 mole C3H8 → 3 CO2, 4 H2O.

O2: 125% of theoretical. Theoretical O2 for 1 mole C3H8 is 5 moles. So actual O2 is 5 *1.25=6.25 moles. But during combustion, 5 moles are consumed, leaving 1.25 moles O2.

Similarly, N2 is 79% of the air. The total air is 125% of theoretical, which is 23.81 *1.25≈29.76 moles. So N2 is 29.76 *0.79≈23.52 moles. So in the products, N2 remains 23.52 moles.

So products:

CO2:3

H2O:4

O2:1.25

N2:23.52

Total:3+4=7, +1.25=8.25, +23.52=31.77 moles.

So CO2 mole fraction:3/31.77≈0.0945 → ~0.0945

H2O:4/31.77≈0.126 → ~0.126

O2:1.25/31.77≈0.0393 → ~0.0393

N2:23.52/31.77≈0.741 → ~0.741

Which matches option B's mole fractions: CO2 0.094, H2O 0.126, O2 0.04, N2 0.74.

So the mole fractions in option B are correct.

But the dew point I calculated is about 121°F, but option B's dew point is 138°F. That's a discrepancy. Did I make a mistake in the dew point calculation?

Wait, perhaps I should use the correct Antoine equation setup. Let me redo that.

The Antoine equation is log P = A - (B/(T + C)), where P is in mmHg, and T is in °C.

We have P =95.76 mmHg.

So:

log(95.76) = 1.9813 =8.14019 - (1810.94/(T +244.485))

Rearranging:

1810.94/(T +244.485) =8.14019 -1.9813 ≈6.1589

So T +244.485 = 1810.94 /6.1589 ≈294.14

T =294.14 -244.485 ≈49.65°C → 121.18°F.

So it's about 121°F.

Looking at the options, none have exactly this. Option F says dew point 125°F, mole fractions CO2:0.092, H2O:0.117, O2:0.048, N2:0.743.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the total moles. Let me recount.

CO2:3

H2O:4

O2:1.25

N2:23.52

Total:3+4=7; 7+1.25=8.25; 8.25+23.52=31.77. That's correct.

Wait, but perhaps the H2O is not all in vapor. If some condenses, the mole fraction would be less. But the question says "combustion products", which usually include water vapor. Alternatively, perhaps the dew point is the temperature where H2O starts to condense, so at that temperature, the mole fraction of H2O would correspond to the saturation vapor pressure at that temperature.

Wait, maybe I should have considered that the mole fraction in the gas phase is the saturation mole fraction at the dew point temperature.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the dew point based on the partial pressure of water vapor.

Wait, perhaps I should use the relation between the partial pressure and the dew point.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula:

dew point temperature Td is given by:

ln(Pw) = (A/Td) + B

But I think that's another form of the Antoine equation.

Alternatively, perhaps using the psychrometric formula, but that's for air, which includes H2O.

Wait, perhaps I should use the relation:

Pw = e^( (8.14019 - 1810.94/(T+244.485)) )

Wait, no, the Antoine equation is log P = A - B/(T+C), so P is in mmHg.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the calculation.

Pw=95.76 mmHg.

log(95.76)=1.9813.

So,

1.9813 =8.14019 - (1810.94/(T+244.485)).

Rearranged,

1810.94/(T+244.485) =8.14019 -1.9813=6.15889.

So,

T+244.485 =1810.94 /6.15889 ≈294.14.

So,

T≈294.14 -244.485=49.655°C.

Which is 49.655°C *9/5=89.379°F +32=121.379°F≈121.4°F.

So about 121°F.

But none of the options have this. The closest is option F (125°F) and option G (120°F). So perhaps the correct option is B, considering the mole fractions, even though the dew point is a bit off.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the partial pressure calculation.

Wait, the mole fraction of H2O is 4/31.77≈0.126. So 0.126 *760 mmHg=95.76 mmHg.

Hmm, perhaps I should double-check the Antoine equation.

Wait, some sources might have different constants. Let me check another set.

Another source provides Antoine constants for water as:

A = 8.14019
B = 1810.94
C = 244.485

Yes, that's consistent. So perhaps the calculation is correct.

So the dew point is around 121°F, but the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct option is B, which has the correct mole fractions but a higher dew point.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the dew point to be calculated using a different approach. Maybe using the露点 formula with the mole fraction.

Wait, another approach: the dew point can be calculated using the formula:

P = P_total * x * (1/(1-x))

Wait, no, that's for relative humidity. Alternatively, the dew point is the temperature where the partial pressure of water equals its saturation pressure at that temperature.

But I think my initial approach was correct. So perhaps the closest option is B, but the dew point is not matching exactly.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the mole fractions.

Wait, let me check the mole fractions again.

Wait, if the reaction is C3H8 +5O2 +18.8N2 →3CO2 +4H2O +18.8N2, then the N2 is 18.8 moles in the products, but in reality, with 125% air, the N2 is 23.52 moles. So perhaps the reaction as given is for 1 mole of propane, but with 18.8 moles of N2, which is the theoretical N2. So when using 125% air, the N2 is 18.8 *1.25=23.5 moles. So the products have 23.5 moles N2.

So the total moles are:

CO2:3

H2O:4

O2:1.25

N2:23.5

Total:31.75.

Wait, earlier I had 31.77, but this is 31.75. Close enough.

So mole fractions:

CO2:3/31.75≈0.0945 →0.0945

H2O:4/31.75≈0.126 →0.126

O2:1.25/31.75≈0.0393 →0.0393

N2:23.5/31.75≈0.741 →0.741

Which matches option B.

So perhaps the dew point in the options is approximate, or perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the change in N2 and O2 and just calculate based on the given reaction. Let me see the given reaction again.

The given reaction is C3H8 +5O2 +18.8N2 →3CO2 +4H2O +18.8N2.

Wait, so the N2 cancels out. So the moles of N2 in the products are the same as in the reactants, 18.8 moles. But in reality, when using 125% air, the N2 is 23.5 moles. So perhaps the given reaction is assuming 100% theoretical air, not 125%.

Ah, that's a key point. The reaction given is for 100% theoretical air. So when the air is 125%, the N2 in the reactants would be 18.8 *1.25=23.5 moles, and the O2 would be 5 *1.25=6.25 moles.

But the reaction given only includes 18.8 N2 and 5 O2. So perhaps when the air is 125%, the moles in the products are:

CO2:3

H2O:4

O2:6.25-5=1.25

N2:23.5.

So total moles:3+4+1.25+23.5=31.75.

Which is what I had earlier.

So the mole fractions are correct as in option B.

As for the dew point, perhaps I should check if the calculation is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the H2O is in liquid form, but that would lower the mole fraction. However, the question asks for the mole fractions of the combustion products, which I think are all in the gas phase, including H2O as vapor.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the dew point to be calculated based on the mole fraction of H2O in the products, considering that at the dew point, the H2O would start to condense.

So, the partial pressure of H2O is (mole fraction) * total pressure. That's what I did earlier.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to use the formula:

dew point temperature Td is when the relative humidity is 100%, so the partial pressure of H2O equals its saturation pressure at Td.

So, using the Antoine equation, I think my calculation is correct, leading to a dew point of about 121°F.

But none of the options match this. So perhaps the correct option is B, even though the dew point doesn't exactly match. Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, let me try recalculating the dew point.

Given P_H2O =95.76 mmHg.

Using Antoine equation:

log P =8.14019 - (1810.94/(T+244.485)).

So,

1.9813 =8.14019 - (1810.94/(T+244.485)).

→ 1810.94/(T+244.485) =8.14019 -1.9813=6.15889.

→ T+244.485=1810.94 /6.15889 ≈294.14.

→ T=294.14 -244.485=49.655°C →121.379°F.

Hmm, that's about 121.4°F.

Looking at the options, perhaps the closest is option J: dew point 130°F, but that's higher. Or option F:125°F.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use a different set of Antoine constants.

Another source says:

For water, the Antoine constants are:

A = 8.14019
B = 1810.94
C = 244.485

Yes, same as before.

Alternatively, perhaps the units were in Kelvin. Wait, no, the Antoine equation is usually in °C.

Wait, perhaps I should use the form where T is in Kelvin.

Wait, no, the equation I used is for T in °C.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the Antoine equation. Another version is:

log P = A - (B / (T + C)), where T is in °C.

Yes, that's correct.

So, I think my calculation is correct, leading to Td of ~121°F.

But none of the options have this. So perhaps the correct option is B, despite the dew point discrepancy, because the mole fractions match.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the student to calculate the dew point as the temperature where the H2O starts to condense, which would be higher than the calculated value if the H2O is not all in vapor.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the air is at 1 atm pressure, but the combustion products may have a different pressure. However, the problem states that the air is at 1 atm, so perhaps the products are also at 1 atm. So the partial pressure approach is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the student to use the mole fraction of H2O to find the dew point using the relation between mole fraction and dew point, but I'm not sure.

Given the time I've spent, I think the correct answer is option B, as the mole fractions match, and perhaps the dew point is approximated.
</think>

The problem involves calculating the dew point and mole fractions of the combustion products when propane burns in dry 125% theoretical air. The reaction provided is:

**C₃H₈ + 5O₂ + 18.8N₂ → 3CO₂ + 4H₂O + 18.8N₂**

### Key Steps:
1. **Mole Fractions Calculation**:
   - For 1 mole of propane, the theoretical air required is 5 moles of O₂ and 18.8 moles of N₂.
   - Since the air is 125% of theoretical, the actual air used is 1.25 × theoretical air.
   - Actual O₂ = 6.25 moles, and actual N₂ = 23.52 moles.
   - Combustion products:
     - CO₂: 3 moles
     - H₂O: 4 moles
     - O₂: 1.25 moles (excess)
     - N₂: 23.52 moles (inert)
   - Total moles in products = 3 + 4 + 1.25 + 23.52 = 31.77 moles.
   - Mole fractions:
     - CO₂: \( \frac{3}{31.77} \approx 0.0945 \)
     - H₂O: \( \frac{4}{31.77} \approx 0.126 \)
     - O₂: \( \frac{1.25}{31.77} \approx 0.0393 \)
     - N₂: \( \frac{23.52}{31.77} \approx 0.741 \)
   - These match the mole fractions in **Option B**.

2. **Dew Point Calculation**:
   - The partial pressure of H₂O is calculated as \( P_{\text{H₂O}} = 0.126 \times 760 \, \text{mmHg} \approx 95.76 \, \text{mmHg} \).
   - Using the Antoine equation for water:
     \[
     \log P = A - \frac{B}{T + C}
     \]
     where \( A = 8.14019 \), \( B = 1810.94 \), \( C = 244.485 \), and \( P = 95.76 \, \text{mmHg} \):
     \[
     \log(95.76) \approx 1.9813 = 8.14019 - \frac{1810.94}{T + 244.485}
     \]
     Solving for \( T \):
     \[
     T + 244.485 \approx \frac{1810.94}{6.1589} \approx 294.14 \implies T \approx 49.65^\circ \text{C} \approx 121.4^\circ \text{F}.
     \]
   - The calculated dew point (~121°F) does not exactly match any option, but **Option B** has the closest mole fractions.

### Conclusion:
The mole fractions match **Option B**, but the dew point is slightly higher than the calculated value. Given the options, **Option B** is the most consistent with the calculations.

**Answer: B**
