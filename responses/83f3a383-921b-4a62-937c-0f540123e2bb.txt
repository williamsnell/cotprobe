Question:

A defendant was arrested at an airport when the small suitcase he was carrying was found to contain heroin. The defendant, who did not challenge the legality of the airport search, was subsequently prosecuted for possession of heroin. At trial, the defendant testified on his own behalf and said that the suitcase belonged to his girlfriend who was accompanying the defendant when he was arrested. The girlfriend died in a skydiving accident two weeks before the defendant's trial. Moreover, the defendant testified that although he was a former heroin addict, he had not used any heroin in the past three years. On cross-examination, the prosecuting attorney asked the defendant to roll up the sleeves of his shirt and exhibit his arms to see if there were any needle marks. This request is

Options:

A: permissible, because the defendant's past addiction could provide context for the possession charge.
B: permissible, because the defendant's physical condition is a matter of public record.
C: objectionable, because it is an invasion of the defendant's personal privacy.
D: objectionable, because the defendant has a privilege against self-incrimination.
E: objectionable, because the defendant's past addiction is protected health information.
F: objectionable, because the defendant's past addiction is not relevant to the current charges.
G: permissible, because such evidence is relevant to the defendant's credibility.
H: permissible, because the defendant waived his privilege against self-incrimination by taking the stand.
I: objectionable, because the probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.
J: permissible, because the defendant's past addiction could imply a motivation for possession.

Okay, so I have this question about criminal procedure, specifically dealing with evidence and cross-examination. Let me try to break this down step by step.

The scenario is a defendant who was arrested at the airport with heroin in his suitcase. He didn't challenge the search's legality, so that's not an issue here. He's being prosecuted for possession. At trial, he testified that the suitcase belonged to his girlfriend, who died two weeks before the trial. He also said he's a former heroin addict but hasn't used in three years.

Now, during cross-examination, the prosecuting attorney asked him to roll up his sleeves to show his arms for needle marks. The question is whether this request is permissible or objectionable, and the options are from A to J.

I remember that in criminal trials, the rules of evidence come into play, especially regarding what can be asked and shown during cross-examination. Let's think about the relevant rules here.

First, the defendant took the stand, so he waived his privilege against self-incrimination for the testimony he gave. But does that mean he can be compelled to provide physical evidence, like showing his arms? I think the Fifth Amendment privilege protects against self-incrimination, but once a defendant testifies, they can be asked questions related to their testimony. However, the physical act of rolling up sleeves might be considered a different matter.

Also, the defendant mentioned he's a former addict. The prosecution might be trying to show that he has recent use, even though he said he hasn't used in three years. Needle marks could indicate recent drug use, which would contradict his testimony. So, the relevance here is whether the physical evidence (needle marks) would impeach his credibility or support the possession charge.

But wait, the defendant said he hasn't used heroin in three years, so if he had needle marks, that could suggest he's lying. However, is it permissible to ask him to expose his arms? There's a privacy aspect here—people have a right to keep their bodies private unless it's relevant and outweighs the privacy interest.

Rule 613 of the Federal Rules of Evidence deals with examining a witness about his character to attack or support their credibility. But more importantly, the question is about whether the court can order the defendant to show his arms. I think that's a physical examination, which might be considered an unreasonable search unless it's relevant and the defendant's privacy isn't outweighed.

Another angle is the defendant's past addiction. Health information, including drug use, is protected under certain laws, but I'm not sure if that's applicable here. Also, the defendant's past addiction might be relevant to his credibility—like, maybe the jury should know he's a former addict to assess his testimony about not using anymore.

Wait, but the question is about the request during cross-examination. The defendant is on the stand, so the prosecution is trying to get physical evidence through him. If the defendant had needle marks, that could be probative of his current use, which would directly relate to his credibility and the possession charge.

However, making the defendant expose his arms might be an invasion of privacy. Alternatively, it could be seen as a way to physically examine him, which might not be allowed without a proper foundation or if it's more prejudicial than probative.

Looking at the options:

A: Permissible because past addiction provides context. That seems possible, as context could be relevant.

B: Permissible because it's a matter of public record. I don't think so; medical info isn't usually public record unless disclosed.

C: Objectionable because invasion of privacy. This is a strong possibility.

D: Objectionable because of self-incrimination. But he's already on the stand, so maybe this isn't the issue.

E: Objectionable because it's protected health info. That could be a factor, but I'm not sure if it's the main issue here.

F: Objectionable because past addiction isn't relevant. But past addiction might be relevant to his credibility, especially if it's about why he's in possession.

G: Permissible because relevant to credibility. This seems plausible because his past could affect how believable he is.

H: Permissible because he waived self-incrimination by testifying. But does that mean he can be forced to provide physical evidence?

I: Objectionable because prejudice outweighs probative value. If the needle marks aren't directly relevant, this could be the case.

J: Permissible because past addiction implies motivation. Maybe, but if he's a former addict, that could be a reason to possess heroin, but the question is about the request's permissibility.

So, thinking about it, the key issue is whether the court can order the defendant to expose his arms. The defendant's past addiction is relevant to his credibility and the charges, but the method of obtaining evidence (exposing his arms) might infringe on his privacy.

I think the objection would be based on privacy rights. The defendant's physical body is private unless it's relevant and the privacy interest isn't outweighed. In this case, while the information might be relevant, the act of exposing his arms could be considered an unreasonable intrusion on his privacy.

Looking at the options, C says it's objectionable because it's an invasion of privacy. That seems to fit. Alternatively, D is about self-incrimination, but since he's already testifying, I think that's less likely. G says it's permissible because relevant to credibility, but the method of getting that evidence might be the issue, not the relevance itself.

So, I'm leaning towards C being the correct answer.

The question revolves around whether the prosecution's request to the defendant to roll up his sleeves and exhibit his arms for needle marks is permissible or objectionable. The defendant, a former heroin addict, testified that he hasn't used heroin in three years, and the suitcase containing heroin was said to belong to his deceased girlfriend. The key considerations are relevance, privacy, and self-incrimination.

The defendant's past addiction is relevant to his credibility, as it could suggest a motive for possessing heroin or contradict his claim of abstinence. However, the method of obtaining evidence—forcing the defendant to expose his arms—raises concerns about privacy and the reasonableness of the request. While the defendant waived his privilege against self-incrimination by testifying, this does not necessarily extend to physical examinations that invade personal privacy.

Considering the options, the strongest argument is that the request is objectionable due to the invasion of the defendant's personal privacy, as the act of exposing his arms is an unreasonable intrusion without sufficient justification. 

Answer: C
