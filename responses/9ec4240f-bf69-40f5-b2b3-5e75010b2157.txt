Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about Feinberg and his discussion on Abraham Lincoln's story related to psychological egoism. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

First, I remember that psychological egoism is the theory that all human actions are motivated by self-interest, either directly or indirectly. It's a view that says every person does everything because it serves their own self-interest, even if they think they're helping others. On the other hand, psychological altruism suggests that people can act selflessly, genuinely wanting to help others without any ulterior motives.

Feinberg is a philosopher who wrote about these concepts. I think he used the example of Abraham Lincoln to critique psychological egoism. So, let me try to recall. Lincoln is often seen as a very altruistic person because he was a great leader who opposed slavery and worked for the Union during the Civil War. His actions were for the good of the country and the people, especially the abolition of slavery.

If Feinberg is discussing this, he's probably using Lincoln's actions as evidence against psychological egoism. Psychological egoism would say that even Lincoln's actions were self-interested. But if Lincoln truly acted out of altruistic motives, that would provide evidence against psychological egoism because it shows that not all actions are self-serving.

Looking at the options, option A says the story provides some evidence against psychological egoism. That makes sense because if Lincoln's actions were genuinely altruistic, it goes against the idea that everything is self-interested.

Option B suggests it supports psychological altruism, which is also possible because Lincoln's actions could be seen as altruistic. But the question is about what Feinberg claims regarding psychological egoism, not necessarily about altruism. Feinberg might be using Lincoln to show that people can act altruistically, thus countering psychological egoism.

Option C says it's irrelevant, but I think Feinberg's point is directly about whether Lincoln's actions count as evidence, so it's relevant.

Option D talks about ethical egoism, which is a different concept. Ethical egoism is about the morality of acting in self-interest, not necessarily about the actual motivations. So probably not D.

Option E says it proves psychological egoism, which doesn't seem right because Feinberg is likely arguing against it.

Option F mentions confusion between ethical and psychological egoism. I don't think Feinberg is making that point here; he's focusing on the motivations, so probably not F.

Option G says it provides no evidence, but if Lincoln's actions are seen as altruistic, they do provide evidence against psychological egoism, so G is probably wrong.

Option H says it contradicts ethical egoism. Ethical egoism is about the morality of self-interest, not the psychological aspect. So H might not be the right choice.

Option I suggests it's a misinterpretation. I don't think so; Feinberg is likely using it correctly to argue against psychological egoism.

Option J says it provides some evidence for psychological egoism, which would be the opposite of what I'm thinking. So if Lincoln's actions are selfless, J isn't correct.

Putting it all together, the story of Lincoln is used to show that people can act altruistically, which provides evidence against psychological egoism. So the answer should be A.
