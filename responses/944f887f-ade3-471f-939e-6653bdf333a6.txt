Okay, so I have this problem about hyperfine splitting for a Cu(II) metal ion. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to work through it step by step.

The question says that the giso is 2.12. I remember that giso is the isomerism constant, which relates the hyperfine splitting energy to the magnetic field. Oh wait, or is it the other way around? I think it's the gyromagnetic ratio. Right, the gyromagnetic ratio (gamma) is related to how much energy splitting occurs in a magnetic field.

The problem states that the Cu(II) ion produces four lines with a separation of 500 MHz between each line. So, the separation is 500 MHz. I'm pretty sure that the hyperfine splitting energy (let's call it A) is related to this frequency.

Wait, I think the formula connects the hyperfine splitting in terms of the magnetic field and the gyromagnetic ratio. The general formula I recall is that the energy splitting ΔE is equal to the gyromagnetic ratio (gamma) multiplied by the magnetic field (B) times the frequency (ν). Or maybe it's the other way around. Oh right, the relation between hyperfine splitting and magnetic field is given by A = g * J * h * B, where J is the spin, but I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to think in terms of the Zeeman effect. For hyperfine splitting, the separation between the lines is related to the magnetic field and the gyromagnetic ratio. The formula for hyperfine splitting energy in terms of frequency is Δν = (A) / (h), where A is the hyperfine coupling constant. But I'm not sure if that's directly applicable here.

Wait, another formula I remember is that the hyperfine splitting in terms of the magnetic field (B) is given by B = (Δν) / (γ/2), where γ is the gyromagnetic ratio. But wait, the gyromagnetic ratio is usually given as γ = g * μ_B / ħ, where μ_B is the Bohr magneton. Hmm, maybe I should look up the exact relation.

Alternatively, I think the conversion between the hyperfine splitting frequency (ν) and the magnetic field (B) is given by B = ν / (γ/2), where γ is in units of MHz/T. Oh right, because γ is typically in MHz per tesla, so when you have a frequency in MHz, dividing by γ gives you the magnetic field in tesla, which you can then convert to millitesla.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me get this straight. The gyromagnetic ratio (gamma) for copper (II) is given as g_iso = 2.12. So I think the formula is B = (ν) / (gamma), but I'm not entirely sure. Or is it B = (nu * 2) / gamma? Because sometimes the splitting is 2ν, depending on the transition.

Wait, in the case of hyperfine splitting, the splitting is typically given by Δν = (A) / h, where A is the hyperfine coupling constant. But A is also related to the magnetic field via A = gamma * B * h. Wait, I'm getting myself confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps the hyperfine splitting energy in frequency units (ν) can be converted to magnetic field using the formula ν (MHz) = (gamma * B (tesla)) / 2. Because I remember that for electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), the relation is that the resonance frequency is proportional to the magnetic field, scaled by the gyromagnetic ratio. The formula I think is ν = γ * B / 2π, but I'm not certain.

Wait, let me think again. The gyromagnetic ratio (gamma) is defined as gamma = (g * mu_B) / hbar, where mu_B is the Bohr magneton. The resonance condition for magnetic dipole transitions is given by the Larmor frequency, which is ν = gamma * B / (2π). So in terms of MHz, if gamma is given in MHz/T, then B in tesla would be B = (ν * 2π) / gamma. Hmm, but wait, I'm getting stuck on the units here.

Alternatively, I've heard that for EPR, the relation between the magnetic field (B) in tesla and the frequency (ν) in GHz is approximately B = ν / (gamma/2), where gamma is in units of GHz/T. Wait, but in this problem, the separation is 500 MHz, which is 0.5 GHz. So if gamma is 2.12 GHz/T, then B = (0.5 GHz) / (2.12 GHz/T) = 0.236 T, which is 236 mT. Wait, but that doesn't match any of the options directly. Hmm.

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake. The hyperfine splitting is the energy difference between the magnetic sublevels, which is given by ΔE = A = g * (mu_B) * B. But then, the frequency ν is related to ΔE via ν = ΔE / h. So:

ν = (g * mu_B * B) / h

But mu_B is the Bohr magneton, which is 9.274×10^-24 J/T. And h (Planck's constant) is 6.626×10^-34 J·s.

So rearranging for B:

B = (ν * h) / (g * mu_B)

But wait, let me calculate that. Let's plug in the numbers.

Given:
ν = 500 MHz = 500 x 10^6 Hz
g = 2.12 (g_iso)
mu_B = 9.274e-24 J/T
h = 6.626e-34 J·s

So B = (500e6 Hz * 6.626e-34 J·s) / (2.12 * 9.274e-24 J/T)

Let me compute the numerator and denominator.

Numerator: 500e6 * 6.626e-34 = 500,000,000 * 6.626e-34 = 3.313e-25 J·s·Hz

Wait, Hz is 1/s, so J·s * 1/s = J.

Denominator: 2.12 * 9.274e-24 = let's calculate that.

2.12 * 9.274e-24 = approximately 2.12 * 9.274 = let's see: 2 *9.274=18.548, 0.12*9.274≈1.11288. So total ≈19.6608e-24 J.

Wait, wait, 2.12 * 9.274e-24 = 2.12 * 9.274 = 2.12 * 9 is 19.08, 2.12 * 0.274 ≈ 0.581, so total ≈19.661e-24 J/T.

Wait, actually, mu_B is in J/T, so denominator is 2.12 * 9.274e-24 J/T.

So B = (3.313e-25 J) / (19.661e-24 J/T) ) 

Wait, wait, numerator is 500e6 *6.626e-34 = 500,000,000 *6.626e-34 = 500,000,000 is 5e8, so 5e8 *6.626e-34 = 3.313e-25 J·s. But Hz is 1/s, so J·s * Hz = J·s * 1/s = J.

Wait, but the denominator is 2.12 * 9.274e-24 = let's compute that exactly.

2.12 *9.274 = let's calculate:

9.274 *2 = 18.548
9.274 *0.12 = 1.11288
So total is 18.548 +1.11288=19.66088e-24.

So denominator is 19.66088e-24 J/T.

So B = (3.313e-25 J) / (19.66088e-24 J/T) ) = (3.313 / 196.6088 ) ) T ≈ 0.01685 T, which is 16.85 mT.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is 16.850 mT. So that's the magnetic field part.

Now, the hyperfine coupling in wavenumbers. Wavenumbers are in cm^-1, and the relation between energy and wavenumber is E = h c ν / c, or E = h c (ν) / c^2? Wait, no. The energy in terms of wavenumbers is E = h c (1/cm), because wavenumbers are 1/λ, which is cm^-1. So, E = h c ν, because ν = c / λ, so E = h ν = h c (1/λ) = h c * wavenumber.

So, to get the wavenumber, it's (h nu) / c. So, nu is the frequency in Hz, but since we're given the separation as 500 MHz, that's 500e6 Hz.

So, E (in J) = h * nu = 6.626e-34 J·s * 500e6 Hz = 6.626e-34 *5e8 = 3.313e-25 J.

To convert this energy to wavenumbers (cm^-1), we use E = h c sigma, where sigma is the wavenumber in cm^-1.

So sigma = E/(h c) = (3.313e-25 J) / (6.626e-34 J·s * 3e8 m/s) )

Wait, let me compute that.

First, compute denominator: 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Now, E is 3.313e-25 J.

So sigma = 3.313e-25 J / (1.9878e-25 J·m) ) = 3.313 / 1.9878 ≈1.667 m^-1. But wait, that's in m^-1. To convert to cm^-1, since 1 m = 100 cm, 1 m^-1 = 0.01 cm^-1. So 1.667 m^-1 = 0.01667 cm^-1.

So the hyperfine coupling in wavenumbers is approximately 0.01667 cm^-1, which is 0.01667 cm^-1, which is roughly 0.0167 cm^-1.

Looking at the options, option C is 0.01667 cm^-1. So the magnetic field is 16.85 mT, and the wavenumber is 0.01667 cm^-1. So the correct option is C.

To solve the problem, we calculate the hyperfine splitting in magnetic field units (mT) and the hyperfine coupling in wavenumbers (cm⁻¹) using the given data:

1. **Given Parameters**:
   - Gyromagnetic ratio, \( g_{\text{iso}} = 2.12 \)
   - Frequency separation, \( \nu = 500 \, \text{MHz} = 500 \times 10^6 \, \text{Hz} \)

2. **Magnetic Field Calculation**:
   The relationship between the frequency and the magnetic field is:
   \[
   B = \frac{\nu \cdot h}{g_{\text{iso}} \cdot \mu_B}
   \]
   Where:
   - \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \) (Planck's constant)
   - \( \mu_B = 9.274 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J/T} \) (Bohr magneton)

   Substituting the values:
   \[
   B = \frac{(500 \times 10^6) \cdot (6.626 \times 10^{-34})}{2.12 \cdot (9.274 \times 10^{-24})}
   \]
   - Numerator: \( 500 \times 10^6 \cdot 6.626 \times 10^{-34} = 3.313 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{J} \)
   - Denominator: \( 2.12 \cdot 9.274 \times 10^{-24} = 1.966 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/T} \)
   - \( B = \frac{3.313 \times 10^{-25}}{1.966 \times 10^{-23}} \approx 0.01685 \, \text{T} = 16.85 \, \text{mT} \)

3. **Hyperfine Coupling in Wavenumbers**:
   The energy splitting is related to the frequency by:
   \[
   E = h \cdot \nu
   \]
   Substituting:
   \[
   E = (6.626 \times 10^{-34}) \cdot (500 \times 10^6) = 3.313 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{J}
   \]
   To convert energy to wavenumbers (\( \tilde{\nu} \) in cm⁻¹):
   \[
   \tilde{\nu} = \frac{E}{h \cdot c}
   \]
   Where \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \). Substituting:
   \[
   \tilde{\nu} = \frac{3.313 \times 10^{-25}}{(6.626 \times 10^{-34}) \cdot (3 \times 10^8)} = \frac{3.313 \times 10^{-25}}{1.9878 \times 10^{-25}} \approx 1.667 \, \text{m}^{-1}
   \]
   Converting to cm⁻¹:
   \[
   \tilde{\nu} = 1.667 \, \text{m}^{-1} \cdot 0.01 = 0.01667 \, \text{cm}^{-1}
   \]

4. **Final Answer**:
   - Magnetic field: \( 16.85 \, \text{mT} \)
   - Wavenumber: \( 0.01667 \, \text{cm}^{-1} \)

Thus, the correct option is **C**.
