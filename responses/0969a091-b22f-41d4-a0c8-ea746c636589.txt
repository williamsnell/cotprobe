Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem where I need to find the work done in moving a charge from point B to point A in a given electric field. Hmm, let's break this down.

First, the electric field is given as E = y a_x + x a_y + 2 a_z. So that's E = y î + x ĵ + 2 k̂. I remember that the work done by an electric field when moving a charge is equal to the line integral of the electric field multiplied by the charge. So the formula should be W = q ∫ E · dr, where q is the charge and dr is the differential displacement vector.

The charge here is 2 C. The path is along the shorter arc of the circle x² + y² = 1 at z=1. So points A and B are both on this circle. Point B is at (1,0,1), and point A is at (0.8, 0.6, 1). Wait, let me check: 0.8² + 0.6² is 0.64 + 0.36 = 1, so yes, point A is on the circle. The path is a part of the circle.

I think the key here is whether the electric field has a component in the direction of the displacement. But wait, in this case, since the path is a closed loop (but wait, it's just an arc, not a full loop), maybe I can use some properties here. Oh, wait, but wait—the work done depends on the potential difference between the points, right?

Wait, actually, the work done is the integral of E · dl from B to A. But if the electric field is conservative, the work done would only depend on the endpoints, not the path. But is E conservative? For that, the curl of E should be zero. Let me compute the curl of E.

The curl of E is given by ∇ × E. Since E has components E_x = y, E_y = x, E_z = 2. The curl in Cartesian coordinates is:

(∂E_z/∂y - ∂E_y/∂z) a_x - (∂E_z/∂x - ∂E_x/∂z) a_y + (∂E_y/∂x - ∂E_x/∂y) a_z.

Calculating each term:

∂E_z/∂y = 0 (since E_z is 2, a constant)
∂E_y/∂z = 0 (E_y is x, no z dependence)
So the first component is 0 - 0 = 0.

Second component:
∂E_z/∂x = 0 (E_z is constant)
∂E_x/∂z = 0 (E_x is y)
So second component is 0 - 0 = 0.

Third component:
∂E_y/∂x = 1 (since E_y = x)
∂E_x/∂y = 1 (since E_x = y)
So third component is 1 - 1 = 0.

So the curl of E is zero. That means the field is conservative, so the work done only depends on the endpoints, not the path. Therefore, I can compute the potential difference between A and B and multiply by the charge.

Wait, but wait: I think that's correct because conservative fields have path-independence. So I can choose any path between A and B, perhaps even a straight line, but in this case, the path is given as an arc, but since it's conservative, it should give the same result as any other path.

Alternatively, since the field is conservative, the work done is the charge times the potential difference: W = q (V_A - V_B).

But how do I find V_A and V_B? Well, the potential can be found by integrating E from a reference point to A and B. Alternatively, since the field is conservative, I can find the potential function.

Wait, another approach: since the field is conservative, the work done is the line integral from B to A, which can be simplified by finding the potential difference.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express the electric field as the gradient of a scalar potential. Because if E is conservative, E = -∇V.

Let me see: E = y î + x ĵ + 2 k̂. So,

E_x = y → which would be the negative derivative of V with respect to x: ∂V/∂x = -y
E_y = x → ∂V/∂y = -x
E_z = 2 → ∂V/∂z = -2

Wait, that seems a bit tricky. Let me try to find V such that:

∂V/∂x = -y → integrate with respect to x: V = -xy + f(y,z)
Then take derivative with respect to y: ∂V/∂y = -x + df/dy = x (Wait, because E_y = x, so ∂V/∂y is -x, but from the integration, it's -x + df/dy. So setting that equal to -x, which implies df/dy = 0. So f(y,z) can only depend on z.

So V = -xy + f(z). Now, take derivative with respect to z: ∂V/∂z = df/dz = -2 (from E_z = 2). So df/dz = -2 → f(z) = -2z + C, where C is a constant.

So the potential function is V = -xy - 2z + C.

Therefore, the potential difference V_A - V_B is [ -x_A y_A - 2 z_A ] - [ -x_B y_B - 2 z_B ].

Let's plug in the points:

Point B is (1,0,1): x=1, y=0, z=1.

Point A is (0.8, 0.6, 1): x=0.8, y=0.6.

Compute V_A: -(0.8)(0.6) - 2*(1) = -0.48 - 2 = -2.48.

V_B: -(1)(0) -2*(1) = 0 -2 = -2.

So the potential difference V_A - V_B = (-2.48) - (-2) = -0.48.

Wait, but wait, the work done W is q*(V_A - V_B). So:

W = 2 C * (-0.48 V) = -0.96 J.

Wait, but the options are positive. Did I make a mistake in the signs?

Wait, because the work done is W = q (V_B - V_A) if you move from B to A. Wait no, let me think again.

Wait, the potential difference is V_A - V_B, and W = q (V_B - V_A), because the work done by the field is q times the potential difference from B to A. Alternatively, the work done by an external agent is the negative of that. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here.

Wait, the formula is W = q ∫ E · dl from B to A. If E is conservative, this equals q (V_B - V_A), because the potential at B minus the potential at A is the work done by the field when moving a positive charge from B to A.

Wait, in our case, V_A = -2.48, V_B = -2.

So V_B - V_A = (-2) - (-2.48) = 0.48.

So W = q (V_B - V_A) = 2 * 0.48 = 0.96 J.

Which matches option A: 0.96 J.

Wait, but earlier when I computed V_A - V_B, it was -0.48, so V_B - V_A is 0.48.

So the work done is 2 * 0.48 = 0.96 J.

Looking at the options, option A is 0.96 J, so that's the answer.

The electric field is given as \( \mathbf{E} = y \mathbf{a}_x + x \mathbf{a}_y + 2 \mathbf{a}_z \), and the charge \( q = 2 \, \mathrm{C} \) is moved along the shorter arc of the circle \( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \) at \( z = 1 \) from point \( B(1, 0, 1) \) to point \( A(0.8, 0.6, 1) \). To determine the work done, we note that the electric field is conservative because its curl is zero. This implies that the work done depends only on the potential difference between points \( A \) and \( B \).

The potential function \( V \) is obtained by integrating the electric field:
\[
\mathbf{E} = -\nabla V \implies V = -xy - 2z + C
\]
where \( C \) is a constant. The potential difference between \( A \) and \( B \) is:
\[
V_A - V_B = [-(0.8)(0.6) - 2(1)] - [-(1)(0) - 2(1)] = -2.48 - (-2) = -0.48 \, \mathrm{V}.
\]
The work done is:
\[
W = q (V_B - V_A) = 2 \, \mathrm{C} \times (0.48 \, \mathrm{V}) = 0.96 \, \mathrm{J}.
\]
Thus, the work expended is \( 0.96 \, \mathrm{J} \).
