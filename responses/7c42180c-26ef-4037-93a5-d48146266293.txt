Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about Anscombe's view of Sidgwick's ethical theory. The question is asking what Anscombe claims Sidgwick says about estimating the badness of an action. The options are A through J, each representing a different criterion.

First, I need to recall what I know about Sidgwick and Anscombe. Henry Sidgwick was a 19th-century utilitarian philosopher. Utilitarianism generally holds that the morality of an action is determined by its consequences, particularly by the greatest good it produces. So, Sidgwick's view is likely centered on consequences.

Now, Anscombe wrote critiques of modern moral philosophy, including discussions of utilitarianism. In her 1958 work "Modern Moral Philosophy," she criticizes the then-current ethical theories, including utilitarianism. She argues that they fail to properly account for the role of moral rules and duties, instead focusing too much on consequences.

The question is specifically about how Sidgwick estimates the badness of an action. If Sidgwick is a utilitarian, he would probably say that the badness is estimated by the expected consequences—like the balance of happiness over suffering. So, the answer might relate to consequences.

Looking at the options, F is "its expected consequences," G is "its actual consequences." Utilitarians often focus on expected outcomes because you can't know the actual outcomes in advance, but you make decisions based on what you expect. So F seems more likely than G.

Other options: A is about social justice, which isn't the main focus of Sidgwick's utilitarianism. B is divine law, which is more deontological and not Sidgwick. C is duties, which Anscombe might emphasize, but Sidgwick was more about consequences. E is intentions, which is more in line with Kantian ethics, not utilitarian. H is potential benefits, which is somewhat related but more about positives rather than the badness. I is personal values, which seems more individualistic. J is cultural norms, which is situational and not the focus of Sidgwick.

So, putting it together, Sidgwick, being a utilitarian, would estimate badness based on the expected consequences, making option F the correct answer.

The correct answer is F: its expected consequences.

F
