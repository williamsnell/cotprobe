Okay, so I've got this problem here: I need to figure out how many different 7-digit numbers can be formed using the digits 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3. The options are given from A to J, and I have to pick the right one. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that when dealing with permutations of multiset (which is what this is, since there are repeated digits), the formula is the factorial of the total number of items divided by the product of the factorials of the counts of each distinct item. The formula is n! divided by (n1! * n2! * ... * nk!), where n is the total number of items, and n1, n2, etc., are the counts of each distinct item.

In this problem, the digits are 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3. Let me count them: 1 appears once, 2 appears twice, and 3 appears four times. So, the total number of digits is 7.

So, applying the formula, the total number of permutations would be 7! divided by (1! * 2! * 4!). Let me compute each part.

7! is 7 factorial, which is 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1. I think that's 5040. Then, 1! is 1, 2! is 2, and 4! is 24. So, multiplying those denominators: 1 * 2 * 24 = 48.

So, the total number of permutations is 5040 divided by 48. Let me calculate that. 5040 ÷ 48. Hmm, let's see: 48 × 100 is 4800, which leaves 240. 48 × 5 is 240, so that's 105. So, 5040 ÷ 48 is 105.

Wait, but wait a second. The problem says "form a 7-digit number." Now, I should check if any of these permutations would start with a zero, but in this case, the digits are 1, 2, 3. So, the smallest digit is 1, meaning none of the permutations would result in a number starting with zero, which isn't allowed for a 7-digit number. So, all permutations are valid, and I don't have to subtract any cases.

So, the total number is 105. Looking back at the options, option C is 105. So, I think the answer should be C.

The number of ways to form a 7-digit number using the digits 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3 is calculated using the formula for permutations of a multiset: 7! / (1! * 2! * 4!) = 5040 / 48 = 105. Since all permutations are valid 7-digit numbers, the answer is 105.

Answer: C
