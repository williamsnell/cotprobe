Question:

Which one of the following criticisms of the Dickey-Fuller/Engle-Granger approach to dealing with cointegrated variables is overcome by the Engle-Yoo (EY) procedure?

Options:

A: In the context of small samples, Dickey Fuller tests are prone to conclude that there is a unit root in a series when there is not
B: The Engle-Granger (EG) approach can only detect up to one cointegrating relationship even though there could be more than one
C: The variables are treated asymmetrically in the cointegrating tests
D: It is not possible to perform tests about the cointegrating relationship

Answer:

Okay, so I have this question about cointegration and different testing procedures. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking which criticism of the Dickey-Fuller/Engle-Granger approach is overcome by the Engle-Yoo (EY) procedure. The options are A to D, and I need to pick the correct one.

First, I remember that cointegration is about finding a long-term relationship between non-stationary variables. The Dickey-Fuller test is used to check for unit roots, which indicate non-stationarity. The Engle-Granger (EG) two-step method is commonly used to test for cointegration. It involves first estimating a cointegrating regression and then testing the residuals for a unit root.

Now, the Engle-Yoo procedure is something I've heard about as an alternative. I think it's related to testing multiple cointegrating relationships, maybe using maximum likelihood estimation. So, what's the problem with the EG approach?

Option A says that in small samples, Dickey Fuller tests might incorrectly conclude a unit root. I think that's more about the limitations of the DF test itself, not necessarily the EG approach. So maybe not A.

Option B states that EG can only detect up to one cointegrating relationship. I recall that the EG method is based on the residuals from a single equation, so it's only for one cointegrating vector. The EY procedure, using the J cointegrating VAR approach, can handle more than one. So B seems like a valid criticism that EY addresses.

Option C mentions asymmetric treatment. I'm not too sure about this. The EG method does involve regressing one variable on others, which might be asymmetric. But I'm not sure if that's the main issue EY fixes. I'll think about it more.

Option D says you can't test about the cointegrating relationship. That doesn't sound right because EG allows you to test the residuals. So D is probably incorrect.

So the main issue is that EG can only find one cointegrating relationship. The EY procedure, being a more advanced method, can handle multiple. So the answer should be B.

The Engle-Granger (EG) approach is limited to detecting a single cointegrating relationship, whereas the Engle-Yoo (EY) procedure can handle multiple cointegrating relationships, addressing this limitation.

Answer: B
