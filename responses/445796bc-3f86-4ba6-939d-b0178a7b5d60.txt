Okay, so I have this question here about asymptotic notations, and I need to figure out which option is the largest asymptotically. Let me start by recalling what each of these big O notations represents in terms of growth rates.

First, I remember that big O notation describes the limiting behavior of a function when the input size grows towards infinity. So, the question is asking which of these functions grows the fastest as n becomes very large.

Looking at the options:

A: O(n²) – that's quadratic growth.
B: O(n³) – cubic growth, which is faster than quadratic.
C: O(sqrt(n)) – square root, which is slower than linear.
D: O(2ⁿ) – exponential growth, which I know grows much faster than polynomial functions.
E: O(log n) – logarithmic growth, which is slower than linear.
F: O(n log n) – this grows faster than linear but slower than quadratic.
G: O(log log n) – even slower than log n.
H: O(1) – constant time, the slowest.
I: O(n) – linear growth.

So, arranging these from slowest to fastest:

O(1) < O(log log n) < O(log n) < O(sqrt(n)) < O(n) < O(n log n) < O(n²) < O(n³) < O(2ⁿ).

Wait, let me make sure. I know that exponential functions like O(2ⁿ) grow much faster than any polynomial function, including cubic O(n³). So, D is definitely the fastest. 

Let me double-check each option's position. O(2ⁿ) is exponential, which is the highest here. So, the order is correct.

The largest asymptotic growth is given by the exponential function O(2ⁿ), which grows faster than all polynomial functions.

Answer: D
