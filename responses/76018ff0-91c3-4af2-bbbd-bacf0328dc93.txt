Okay, so I've got this problem here about calculating a percentage discount. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question says that the list price of a watch is $300, and the net price is $174. I need to find out what percentage discount was offered.

Hmm, percentage discount. I remember that the formula for percentage discount is something like (Discount Amount / Original Price) multiplied by 100 to get the percentage. So first, I think I need to find out how much the discount was in dollars.

The list price is $300, and the net price after discount is $174. So the discount amount must be the difference between these two, right? So I subtract 174 from 300. Let me do that: 300 minus 174. Let's see, 300 minus 170 is 130, and then minus 4 more would be 126. So the discount amount is $126.

Now, I need to find what percentage $126 is of the original $300. That's where the formula comes in. So the formula is (126 / 300) * 100. Let me compute that. 

First, 126 divided by 300. Hmm, 300 goes into 126 zero times, but if I add a decimal, it's easier. So 300 goes into 1260 four times because 4 times 300 is 1200. That leaves 60. Bring down another zero, making it 600. 300 goes into 600 exactly twice. So putting that together, 126 divided by 300 is 0.42.

Wait, that's 0.42, right? Because 0.42 multiplied by 300 is 126. So to get the percentage, I multiply 0.42 by 100, which gives me 42%. So the discount is 42%.

Let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. The original price is 300, discount is 42%, so 42% of 300 is 126. Adding that discount to the net price: 300 minus 126 is 174, which matches the given net price. So that seems correct.

Looking at the options, option B is 42%, so I think that's the right answer.

The discount amount is $126 (300 - 174). To find the percentage discount, divide 126 by 300, which equals 0.42. Multiply by 100 to get 42%.
