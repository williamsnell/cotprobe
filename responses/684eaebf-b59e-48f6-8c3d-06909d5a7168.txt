Okay, so I've got this economics question here about price floors and what the government does when they set one. Let me try to think it through step by step.

First, I remember that a price floor is a minimum price that can be charged for a good. It's set above the equilibrium price, right? So when the government does this, it's trying to influence the market in some way.

The question is asking why the government would establish a price floor. The options are from A to J. Let me go through them one by one.

Option A: Eliminate a surplus. Wait, no. If the price floor is set above equilibrium, that would create a surplus, not eliminate it. Because at a higher price, supply increases and demand decreases, leading to more supply than demand, which is a surplus. So A doesn't make sense as a reason for setting a price floor.

Option B: Protect consumers from price hikes. Hmm, actually, a price floor sets a minimum price. So if prices are allowed to fall, a price floor might prevent prices from dropping too low, but it's more about preventing prices from going too high? Wait, no, I think I'm mixing this up. Price ceilings are set to prevent prices from going too high, like rent control. Price floors are to prevent prices from going too low. So maybe this option is about protecting consumers from prices being too low? Wait, no, option B says "price hikes," which refers to high prices. So a price floor wouldn't do that. So B might not be correct.

Option C: Increase government revenue. I'm not sure about this. Price floors don't directly affect government revenue unless the government is buying the goods, like in a support price scenario. But I don't think setting a price floor is primarily about increasing revenue. Maybe through taxes, but I don't think that's the main reason here.

Option D: Eliminate a shortage. A shortage occurs when the price is below equilibrium. If the government sets a price floor above the equilibrium, it might cause a surplus, not eliminate a shortage. So D doesn't seem right.

Option E: Help buyers of the good. If the price floor is set, buyers might have to pay more than they would in a free market. So it's not helping buyers; it's actually helping sellers. So E seems incorrect.

Option F: Promote competition among sellers. I don't see how a price floor would promote competition. It might reduce it because if the price is fixed, sellers don't have to compete on price, maybe leading to less competition. So F doesn't fit.

Option G: Help sellers of the good. Yes, that makes sense. A price floor ensures that sellers get at least a certain price for their goods. For example, in agriculture, governments set price floors to support farmers' incomes. So G seems correct.

Option H: Control inflation. That's more about price ceilings or general monetary policies, not specifically about price floors. So H is probably not the answer.

Option I: Discourage consumption of the good. A higher price might reduce demand, but I don't think that's the primary reason for a price floor. Usually, price floors are to help sellers, not to discourage consumption.

Option J: Reduce production cost for the good. I don't think a price floor directly affects production costs. It affects the price at which goods are sold, not the costs incurred in production.

So putting it all together, the main reason for a price floor is to help sellers by ensuring they get a minimum price. So the correct answer should be G.

The government establishes a price floor in a market to help sellers of the good by ensuring they receive a minimum price for their products.
