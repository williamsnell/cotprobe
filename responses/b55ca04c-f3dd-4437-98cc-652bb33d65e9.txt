Question:

How does metamorphosis differ from molting? What animals other than arthropods are known to undergo metamorphosis in their development?

Options:

A: Metamorphosis only occurs in insects, while molting occurs in all animals including mammals and birds.
B: Metamorphosis involves the development of gills in aquatic animals, and molting is the development of lungs in terrestrial animals. Mollusks undergo metamorphosis.
C: Only arthropods undergo metamorphosis
D: Molting and metamorphosis are the same process
E: Molting is a change in coloration of the animal, while metamorphosis involves the shedding of skin. Fish are known to undergo metamorphosis.
F: Molting involves a change from the juvenile to the adult form, unlike metamorphosis which is shedding of the exoskeleton to allow growth
G: Molting is the process of transitioning from water to land habitats, whereas metamorphosis is the process of changing from carnivorous to herbivorous diets. Echinoderms undergo metamorphosis.
H: Metamorphosis is the process where animals grow additional legs, whereas molting is for growing wings. Reptiles also undergo metamorphosis.
I: Metamorphosis involves a change from the juvenile to the adult form, unlike molting which is shedding of the exoskeleton to allow growth. Amphibians like frogs and aquatic animals like sea stars also undergo metamorphosis
J: Metamorphosis is the process of internal organ development, and molting is the growth of new appendages. Certain species of annelids undergo metamorphosis.

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question here about metamorphosis and molting. I'm a bit rusty on this topic, but let me think it through step by step.

First, the question is asking two things: how do metamorphosis and molting differ, and which animals other than arthropods undergo metamorphosis. The options are labeled A to J, so I need to figure out which one is correct.

Let me start by recalling what I know about these terms. Metamorphosis refers to a process where an animal goes through significant changes in form during its development. The most common examples are probably frogs, which go from tadpoles to frogs. Insects also have metamorphosis, like caterpillars turning into butterflies. But wait, the question is about animals other than arthropods, so I shouldn't focus just on insects.

Molting, on the other hand, I think is the process of shedding the exoskeleton in arthropods. For example, when a beetle or a crab molts, it's because they need to grow, as their exoskeleton doesn't expand. So molting is specifically about shedding an exoskeleton to allow growth, which is a part of the arthropod life cycle.

Now, the first part of the question is about the difference between metamorphosis and molting. From what I remember, metamorphosis is a broader term that includes changes in body structure, sometimes involving different stages like larva, pupa, and adult. Molting is more specific to the shedding of the exoskeleton, which allows the animal to grow larger. So, they're different processes. Metamorphosis is about developmental changes, while molting is about growth through shedding.

Looking at the options, I need to find the one that correctly states this difference and also mentions other animals besides arthropods that undergo metamorphosis.

Option A: "Metamorphosis only occurs in insects, while molting occurs in all animals including mammals and birds." Hmm, I know that's not right because metamorphosis isn't only in insects. Frogs, for example, are not arthropods and go through metamorphosis. So A is incorrect.

Option B: "Metamorphosis involves the development of gills in aquatic animals, and molting is the development of lungs in terrestrial animals. Mollusks undergo metamorphosis." Wait, gills and lungs might be part of specific cases, but I'm not sure if that's the general definition. Also, molting isn't about developing lungs. Plus, mollusks do undergo metamorphosis, but I'm not sure if this option correctly differentiates the two processes.

Option C: "Only arthropods undergo metamorphosis." That's definitely wrong because, as I thought earlier, frogs (amphibians) and others undergo metamorphosis.

Option D: "Molting and metamorphosis are the same process." No, they are different, so D is incorrect.

Option E: "Molting is a change in coloration of the animal, while metamorphosis involves the shedding of skin. Fish are known to undergo metamorphosis." Wait, molting isn't about color change. It's about shedding the exoskeleton. So E is wrong.

Option F: "Molting involves a change from the juvenile to the adult form, unlike metamorphosis which is shedding of the exoskeleton to allow growth." No, that's reversed. Metamorphosis is about changing forms, and molting is about shedding exoskeleton for growth. So F is incorrect.

Option G: "Molting is the process of transitioning from water to land habitats, whereas metamorphosis is the process of changing from carnivorous to herbivorous diets. Echinoderms undergo metamorphosis." That seems off. Molting isn't about habitat transitions, and I don't think that's correct. Plus, while echinoderms do have various life stages, I'm not sure if that's considered metamorphosis.

Option H: "Metamorphosis is the process where animals grow additional legs, whereas molting is for growing wings. Reptiles also undergo metamorphosis." No, growing legs isn't the main point of metamorphosis. Wings in insects are part of metamorphosis, but this option doesn't correctly differentiate molting and metamorphosis.

Option I: "Metamorphosis involves a change from the juvenile to the adult form, unlike molting which is shedding of the exoskeleton to allow growth. Amphibians like frogs and aquatic animals like sea stars also undergo metamorphosis." This seems correct. Metamorphosis is about changing from juvenile to adult forms, while molting is shedding the exoskeleton for growth. Also, amphibians (like frogs) and some aquatic animals like sea stars undergo metamorphosis. So I think I is the correct option.

Option J: "Metamorphosis is the process of internal organ development, and molting is the growth of new appendages. Certain species of annelids undergo metamorphosis." No, that's not right. Molting isn't about appendages; it's about shedding the exoskeleton. So J is incorrect.

So after going through each option, I think option I is the correct answer because it accurately describes the difference between metamorphosis and molting and mentions the correct animals.

The correct answer is I because it accurately distinguishes metamorphosis as a change from juvenile to adult form, while molting is about shedding the exoskeleton for growth. It also correctly identifies amphibians like frogs and some aquatic animals, such as sea stars, as undergoing metamorphosis.
