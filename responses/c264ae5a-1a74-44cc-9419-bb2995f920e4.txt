Okay, so I've got this question about preemphasis circuits in FM systems. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to walk through it step by step.

Alright, the question says the transfer function is |H_p(f)|² = k²f². So, it's a preemphasis circuit, which I remember is used to boost the higher frequencies in a signal. This is often done in FM systems to counteract the frequency-selective fading that might occur over the channel, especially for lower frequencies.

The modulating signal has a spectral density G(f) = G₀ / [1 + (f/f₁)²], and it's given that f₁ is much less than f_m (the modulating frequency). Wait, actually, f_1 is probably the bandwidth or a parameter related to the signal's spectral shape. Hmm.

The goal is to determine a suitable value of k² such that preemphasis does not affect the bandwidth of the channel. So, I think this means that after applying the preemphasis, the bandwidth should remain the same as before. Or maybe the preemphasis doesn't introduce any additional bandwidth expansion.

I remember that in FM modulation, the bandwidth of the transmitted signal depends on the modulating signal's spectral characteristics. The preemphasis circuit modifies the modulating signal's spectrum before it's used to modulate the carrier. So, if we apply a preemphasis that boosts certain frequencies, it might affect the bandwidth unless properly designed.

The spectral density G(f) is given as a low-pass type, with a peak at f=0 and a rolloff determined by f₁. Since f₁ << f_m, I think this means that the significant components of the modulating signal are at higher frequencies compared to f₁. Wait, no, actually, f₁ is probably the corner frequency where the spectral density starts to roll off. So, if f₁ is small, the spectral density falls off quickly beyond f₁.

Wait, but the question says f₁ << f_m. So, f_m is the maximum frequency of the modulating signal, perhaps. So, the spectral density G(f) is highest around low frequencies and decreases as f increases beyond f₁.

The preemphasis transfer function is |H_p(f)|² = k²f². So, this is a high-frequency boost, as the gain increases with f². Preemphasis is usually designed to boost higher frequencies to counteract the channel's attenuation at lower frequencies, making the transmitted signal more robust.

Now, the problem is about ensuring that the preemphasis doesn't affect the bandwidth. So, I think this means that after applying the preemphasis, the bandwidth of the signal doesn't change. Or perhaps the preemphasis doesn't cause the signal to require a wider bandwidth than it originally had.

Wait, but FM modulation's bandwidth is determined by the highest frequency component of the modulating signal, plus some factor based on the modulation index. So, if the preemphasis boosts higher frequencies beyond f_m, it might cause the bandwidth to increase, which we want to avoid. So, we need to choose k² such that the preemphasis doesn't extend the bandwidth beyond a certain point.

Alternatively, maybe the preemphasis is designed so that it doesn't alter the effective bandwidth of the system. So, the product of the preemphasis and the original spectral density should have a bandwidth that doesn't exceed a certain limit.

Wait, perhaps we need to find k² such that the preemphasis doesn't cause the signal's spectrum to extend beyond the original bandwidth. So, the preemphasis should only amplify frequencies within the original bandwidth without extending it.

But I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The modulating signal's spectral density is G(f) = G₀ / [1 + (f/f₁)²]. So, this is a Lorentzian-shaped spectrum, peaking at DC and falling off at higher frequencies. The preemphasis is H_p(f) = k f, so its magnitude squared is k² f².

The product of these two would be the modified spectral density after preemphasis: G_p(f) = |H_p(f)|² * G(f) = k² f² * [G₀ / (1 + (f/f₁)²)].

But in FM, the transmitted signal's bandwidth is determined by the highest frequency component of the modulating signal after any preemphasis. So, if the preemphasis boosts frequencies beyond f_m, the highest frequency component might increase, thus increasing the bandwidth.

Wait, but the question says that f₁ << f_m. So, f₁ is much smaller than f_m, the maximum frequency of the modulating signal. So, the spectral density G(f) is significant up to f_m, but beyond that, it's negligible.

But applying a preemphasis that increases with f² could potentially cause the higher frequencies beyond f_m to be boosted, but since G(f) is zero beyond f_m, that's not the case. Wait, no, G(f) isn't zero beyond f_m, it's just that it's much smaller. So, if the preemphasis boost continues beyond f_m, it might cause the signal's spectrum to have higher frequencies, but since G(f) is already low there, maybe it's negligible.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the preemphasis doesn't cause the spectral density to have a wider bandwidth than it originally had. So, the product G_p(f) should have a bandwidth that doesn't exceed that of the original G(f). But I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the preemphasis is designed such that the product of the transfer function and the original spectrum doesn't introduce any new frequency components beyond what's necessary.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think about the integral of the spectral density after preemphasis. The bandwidth is related to the integral of the spectral density over all frequencies. So, if the preemphasis doesn't change the integral, then the bandwidth remains the same.

Wait, no, the bandwidth in FM is more about the highest frequency component, not the integral. The bandwidth of an FM signal is approximately 2βf_m, where β is the modulation index. So, if the preemphasis doesn't change f_m, the bandwidth remains the same. But if preemphasis boosts frequencies beyond f_m, then f_m could effectively increase, thus increasing the bandwidth.

Wait, but the modulating signal's maximum frequency is f_m, so even with preemphasis, the maximum frequency modulated would still be f_m. So, perhaps the preemphasis doesn't affect the maximum frequency, thus not changing the bandwidth. But that can't be right because the preemphasis does affect the spectrum within the bandwidth.

Wait, maybe the issue is that the preemphasis should not cause the signal's spectral density to have significant components beyond a certain bandwidth, thus not increasing the overall bandwidth. So, perhaps the preemphasis should be such that it doesn't cause the product G_p(f) to have significant contributions beyond a certain frequency, say 2f_m or something.

Alternatively, perhaps the condition is that the preemphasis doesn't introduce any new spectral components beyond the original bandwidth, ensuring that the bandwidth remains as determined by the original signal.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck, so maybe I should try to model this mathematically.

The spectral density after preemphasis is G_p(f) = k²f² * G(f) = k² f² * [G₀ / (1 + (f/f₁)²)].

To find the bandwidth, we might look at the point where G_p(f) is significant, say when it's a certain fraction of its maximum value. The original G(f) has a maximum at f=0, and falls off at higher f.

But since preemphasis is applied, G_p(f) would have a maximum somewhere. Wait, because G(f) is maximum at f=0, and H_p(f) is zero at f=0, so G_p(f) would start at zero and increase with f. So, the maximum of G_p(f) would be where the product of f² and 1/(1 + (f/f₁)^2) is maximum.

Taking the derivative of G_p(f) with respect to f to find the maximum might help, but that could be complicated. Alternatively, perhaps we can find the condition that the product doesn't cause the spectral density to extend beyond a certain frequency, say f_max, which is the original bandwidth.

Wait, but the original bandwidth is determined by the modulating signal's maximum frequency, f_m. So, perhaps the preemphasis should be designed such that the product G_p(f) doesn't have significant components beyond f_m, thus keeping the bandwidth the same.

Wait, but preemphasis is a high-frequency boost, so it might cause the spectral density to have higher components beyond f_m, but if f₁ is much less than f_m, then at f_m, the term (f/f₁) is large, so 1/(1 + (f/f₁)^2) is approximately f₁²/f². So, G(f) at f_m is approximately G₀ f₁² / f_m².

Then, G_p(f) at f_m is k² f_m² * [G₀ f₁² / f_m²] = k² G₀ f₁².

Wait, but that's just a value at f_m. Does that affect the bandwidth? I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the condition is that the preemphasis doesn't cause the spectral density to have a higher cut-off frequency, thus not increasing the bandwidth beyond what's needed.

Wait, another approach: in FM systems, the preemphasis is often matched to the expected channel characteristics. If the channel has a certain frequency response, the preemphasis is designed to compensate for it. So, perhaps the preemphasis should be such that when combined with the channel's response, it results in a flat response. But I'm not sure if that's directly applicable here.

Wait, the question says that the preemphasis should not affect the bandwidth. So, perhaps the condition is that the product of the preemphasis transfer function and the original spectral density doesn't result in a wider bandwidth than before.

But how do we quantify that? Maybe by ensuring that the integral of the product over all frequencies is the same as the original, but that might not directly relate to bandwidth.

Alternatively, perhaps the preemphasis is designed such that the bandwidth after preemphasis is the same as the original. The original bandwidth is determined by the modulating signal's highest frequency, f_m. So, the preemphasis shouldn't cause the highest frequency to be higher than f_m, thus keeping the bandwidth the same.

But how does the preemphasis affect the highest frequency? If the original modulating signal has a maximum frequency f_m, and the preemphasis is applied, the maximum frequency remains f_m because the modulating signal's bandwidth is f_m. So, perhaps the preemphasis doesn't affect the maximum frequency, thus the bandwidth remains the same.

Wait, but that seems too simplistic. Maybe the issue is that the preemphasis could cause the signal's spectrum to have higher amplitudes at frequencies near f_m, which could affect the effective bandwidth in terms of the signal's energy distribution.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the Nyquist bandwidth or the channel's bandwidth. If the channel has a certain bandwidth, the preemphasis shouldn't cause the signal to require a wider channel.

But I'm not entirely certain. Maybe I should look for a condition where the preemphasis transfer function doesn't cause the spectral density to have significant components beyond a certain frequency.

Looking at the options, they all involve k² being less than or equal to some expression involving f₁ and f_m. So, perhaps the condition is that the preemphasis transfer function, when multiplied by the spectral density, doesn't cause the product to have components beyond a certain frequency, say 2f_m or something like that.

Wait, let's think about the product G_p(f) = k² f² * [G₀ / (1 + (f/f₁)^2)]. The question is to find the condition on k² such that the bandwidth isn't affected. So, perhaps the product should not have significant components beyond a certain frequency, say 2f_m.

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum of G_p(f) occurs at a frequency where f is such that the product is still within the original bandwidth. So, finding where the maximum of G_p(f) occurs.

To find the maximum of G_p(f), take the derivative of G_p(f) with respect to f and set it to zero.

Let me compute dG_p/df:

G_p(f) = k² G₀ f² / (1 + (f/f₁)^2) = k² G₀ f² / (1 + (f²/f₁²)).

Let me set u = f². Then, G_p = k² G₀ u / (1 + u/f₁²) = k² G₀ u f₁² / (f₁² + u).

But taking derivative with respect to f:

dG_p/df = k² G₀ [2f (1 + f²/f₁²) - f²*(2f/f₁²)] / (1 + f²/f₁²)^2.

Wait, that's a bit messy. Alternatively, let me compute it directly.

dG_p/df = d/df [k² G₀ f² / (1 + (f/f₁)^2)].

Using quotient rule:

Numerator: d/df (f²) = 2f.

Denominator: 1 + (f²/f₁²).

So,

dG_p/df = k² G₀ [ (2f)(1 + (f²/f₁²)) - f²*(2f/f₁²) ] / (1 + (f²/f₁²))^2.

Simplify numerator:

2f [1 + f²/f₁² - f²/f₁²] = 2f [1] = 2f.

So,

dG_p/df = k² G₀ [2f] / (1 + (f²/f₁²))^2.

Wait, that can't be right because the denominator is squared. Wait, let me recheck the algebra.

Wait, the numerator after differentiation is:

2f (1 + (f²/f₁²)) - f²*(2f/f₁²) = 2f + 2f^3/f₁² - 2f^3/f₁² = 2f.

So, the derivative is:

dG_p/df = k² G₀ * 2f / (1 + (f²/f₁²))^2.

Setting this equal to zero for maxima. But 2f is zero only at f=0, which is a minimum. So, the maximum occurs as f increases. Wait, that can't be right because the derivative is always positive for f>0, meaning G_p(f) increases with f, which implies that the maximum is at the highest f, but that's not possible because G_p(f) would eventually drop off due to the denominator.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the derivative. Let me compute it again.

G_p(f) = k² G₀ f² / (1 + (f/f₁)^2) = k² G₀ f² (f₁² + f²)^(-1).

Let me compute dG_p/df:

= k² G₀ [ 2f (f₁² + f²)^(-1) - f² * (2f)(f₁² + f²)^(-2) ) ].

Factor out 2f (f₁² + f²)^(-2):

= k² G₀ (2f) (f₁² + f²)^(-2) [ (f₁² + f²) - f² ].

Simplify inside the brackets: f₁² + f² - f² = f₁².

So,

dG_p/df = k² G₀ (2f) (f₁²) / (f₁² + f²)^2.

Which is positive for all f>0. So, the function G_p(f) is always increasing for f>0, which suggests that the maximum is at the highest frequency. But that can't be right because as f approaches infinity, G_p(f) approaches k² G₀ f² / (f²/f₁²) ) = k² G₀ f² * f₁² / f² = k² G₀ f₁², which is a constant. So, the function increases until f approaches infinity, where it levels off.

Wait, but that's not possible because for very high f, the denominator (1 + (f/f₁)^2) = (f² + f₁²)/f₁², so G_p(f) = k² G₀ f² * f₁²/(f² + f₁²) ≈ k² G₀ f₁² as f becomes very large. So, the function increases and then asymptotically approaches a constant. Therefore, the maximum is at f approaching infinity, which isn't practical.

But that suggests that the spectral density after preemphasis has a higher amplitude at higher frequencies, but doesn't have a maximum point within the finite range. So, perhaps the maximum is at the highest frequency of interest, which is f_m.

But if f₁ << f_m, then at f = f_m, the term (f/f₁) is large, so (f/f₁)^2 >> 1, so 1 + (f/f₁)^2 ≈ (f/f₁)^2. Therefore, G(f) ≈ G₀ f₁² / f². So, G_p(f) at f_m is k² f_m² * G₀ f₁² / f_m² = k² G₀ f₁².

But I'm not sure how this relates to the bandwidth. Maybe the issue is that the preemphasis should not cause the spectral density to have significant components beyond a certain frequency, say f_max, which is related to the original bandwidth.

Alternatively, perhaps the condition is that the preemphasis doesn't cause the spectral density to have a higher cutoff frequency, thus not increasing the bandwidth.

Wait, but the preemphasis is a high-pass filter, so it boosts higher frequencies, which would suggest that the spectral density after preemphasis would have more energy at higher frequencies, potentially increasing the effective bandwidth.

But the question states that preemphasis should not affect the bandwidth. So, perhaps the preemphasis is designed such that the bandwidth remains the same as the original modulating signal's bandwidth. So, the preemphasis should not introduce any new spectral components beyond f_m.

But I'm not sure how to translate that into a condition on k².

Alternatively, perhaps the condition is that the preemphasis transfer function's gain doesn't cause the spectral density to have significant components beyond a certain frequency, say f_m + Δf, where Δf is small compared to f_m. So, we need to find k² such that beyond f_m, the product G_p(f) is negligible.

But how to quantify that? Maybe by ensuring that at f = f_m + something, the product is below a certain threshold. For example, ensuring that at f = 2f_m, G_p(f) is negligible.

But I'm not sure. Maybe I should look for a condition where the preemphasis doesn't cause the spectral density to extend beyond a certain frequency. Let's say we set that the product G_p(f) at f = 2f_m is less than or equal to a certain value, perhaps the same as at f_m.

So, G_p(f) at f = 2f_m is k² (2f_m)^2 * [G₀ / (1 + (2f_m/f₁)^2)].

We might want this to be less than or equal to G_p(f_m), which is k² f_m² * [G₀ / (1 + (f_m/f₁)^2)].

Setting G_p(2f_m) ≤ G_p(f_m):

k² (4f_m²) [G₀ / (1 + (2f_m/f₁)^2)] ≤ k² f_m² [G₀ / (1 + (f_m/f₁)^2)].

Canceling k² G₀ and f_m²:

4 / [1 + (2f_m/f₁)^2] ≤ 1 / [1 + (f_m/f₁)^2].

Multiply both sides by denominators (assuming positive):

4 [1 + (f_m/f₁)^2] ≤ 1 + (2f_m/f₁)^2.

Expanding:

4 + 4 (f_m/f₁)^2 ≤ 1 + 4 (f_m/f₁)^2.

Subtract 4 (f_m/f₁)^2 from both sides:

4 ≤ 1.

Which is impossible. So, that condition can't be met, which suggests that my approach is wrong.

Hmm, maybe I should approach this differently. Perhaps the condition is that the preemphasis doesn't cause the signal's bandwidth to increase beyond a certain point, so the product of H_p(f) and G(f) should have a bandwidth that doesn't exceed a limit.

Alternatively, perhaps the preemphasis should be such that the product G_p(f) has a certain shape that doesn't require a wider bandwidth. For example, the product should not have a spectral tail beyond a certain frequency.

Wait, another approach: the bandwidth of a signal is often related to the rate at which its spectral density drops off. If the preemphasis causes the spectral density to drop off more slowly, the effective bandwidth increases. So, perhaps the preemphasis should be designed such that the product G_p(f) drops off no more slowly than the original G(f), thus keeping the bandwidth the same.

But I'm not sure how to translate that into a condition on k².

Wait, perhaps the key is to ensure that the preemphasis doesn't cause the spectral density to have a higher frequency component beyond a certain point. So, perhaps the condition is that the product G_p(f) at f = 2f_m is less than or equal to a certain fraction of its value at f = f_m.

Alternatively, perhaps the condition is that the preemphasis transfer function doesn't introduce any gain beyond a certain frequency, say f = 2f_m, to prevent the bandwidth from expanding.

But I'm not making much progress here. Let me look at the options again.

Options are all of the form k² ≤ something. So, perhaps we're looking for the maximum value of k² such that the preemphasis doesn't cause the spectral density to have significant components beyond a certain frequency, thereby keeping the bandwidth the same.

Looking at the options, option I is k² ≤ π/(f₁(2f_m - πf₁)), and option H is 2π/(f₁(2f_m - πf₁)), and others.

Wait, perhaps the condition involves the integral of the product G_p(f) over all frequencies. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the preemphasis should be such that the product G_p(f) has a certain form, like a Butterworth or Chebyshev response, but that's probably beyond the scope here.

Wait, another thought: in FM systems, the preemphasis is often matched to the expected channel response. For example, if the channel has a transfer function H_c(f) that attenuates lower frequencies, the preemphasis H_p(f) is the inverse, boosting them. But in this question, the channel isn't specified, so perhaps the preemphasis is designed such that it doesn't affect the bandwidth, meaning that the product H_p(f) G(f) has the same bandwidth as G(f).

But I'm not sure how to proceed. Maybe I should consider the Fourier transform of the modulating signal. The spectral density G(f) is the Fourier transform of the autocorrelation function of the modulating signal. The preemphasis modifies this, so the new spectral density is G_p(f) = |H_p(f)|² * G(f).

The bandwidth is determined by the highest frequency component. So, if the original modulating signal has a bandwidth up to f_m, and the preemphasis doesn't boost frequencies beyond f_m, then the bandwidth remains f_m. But preemphasis is a high-pass filter, so it boosts higher frequencies, but if the original signal's spectral density is zero beyond f_m, then boosting beyond that doesn't add anything.

But wait, the modulating signal's spectral density is zero beyond f_m, so preemphasis beyond f_m doesn't add anything. So, the maximum frequency remains f_m, thus the bandwidth remains the same. So, perhaps any value of k² is acceptable because the preemphasis doesn't affect the maximum frequency. But that can't be right because the options suggest a specific condition.

Alternatively, perhaps the condition is that the preemphasis doesn't cause the spectral density to have a higher amplitude at f_m than the original, thus preserving the peak. But that seems unlikely because preemphasis boosts higher frequencies.

Wait, but if the original spectral density at f_m is G(f_m) = G₀/(1 + (f_m/f₁)^2), and the preemphasis gives G_p(f_m) = k² f_m² G(f_m), then perhaps we want G_p(f_m) to be less than or equal to some value, but I'm not sure what that value would be.

Alternatively, perhaps the condition is that the preemphasis doesn't cause the spectral density to have a higher amplitude at f_m than the original, but that doesn't make sense because preemphasis is supposed to boost higher frequencies.

I'm getting stuck, so perhaps I should try to think of this in terms of the transmitted signal's bandwidth. The preemphasis is applied to the modulating signal before it's used to modulate the carrier. So, the transmitted signal's bandwidth is determined by the modulating signal's bandwidth plus any effects of the preemphasis.

But in FM, the bandwidth is determined by the highest frequency component of the modulating signal. So, if the original modulating signal's highest frequency is f_m, then even after preemphasis, the highest frequency is still f_m, so the bandwidth remains the same. Therefore, any k² would be acceptable because the preemphasis doesn't change the maximum frequency.

But that contradicts the question's implication that a suitable k² must be found, suggesting that some constraint exists. So, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the preemphasis affects the effective modulation index. If the preemphasis boosts the higher frequencies in the modulating signal, it could effectively increase the modulation index, leading to a wider bandwidth. But the question states that the preemphasis shouldn't affect the bandwidth, so perhaps the preemphasis is designed such that the modulation index remains the same.

Alternatively, perhaps the preemphasis is applied after the modulator, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: the preemphasis is part of the transmitter to compensate for the channel's frequency response. So, if the channel has a certain frequency response, the preemphasis should counteract it. But without knowing the channel's response, perhaps the condition is that the preemphasis doesn't introduce any additional gain beyond a certain frequency, thus not affecting the bandwidth.

Alternatively, perhaps the condition is that the preemphasis transfer function doesn't cause the product G_p(f) to have a higher amplitude at frequencies beyond f_m, thus not increasing the bandwidth.

But I'm not making progress. Let me try to think of possible conditions.

The options involve terms like f_m ± πf₁. Since f₁ is much less than f_m, these terms would be approximately 2f_m, but with some correction.

Looking at option I: k² ≤ π/(f₁(2f_m - πf₁)).

Given that f₁ << f_m, the denominator 2f_m - πf₁ ≈ 2f_m. So, option I becomes approximately k² ≤ π/(2f₁ f_m).

Similarly, option H is 2π/(f₁(2f_m - πf₁)) ≈ 2π/(2f₁ f_m) = π/(f₁ f_m).

But I'm not sure which one is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the condition arises from ensuring that the preemphasis doesn't cause the spectral density to have significant components beyond a certain frequency, say f_max = 2f_m - πf₁, which would be close to 2f_m since f₁ << f_m.

Wait, perhaps the condition is that the product G_p(f) should be zero beyond a certain frequency, but that's not possible with the given transfer function.

Alternatively, perhaps the condition is derived from ensuring that the preemphasis doesn't cause the spectral density to have a certain slope, thereby keeping the bandwidth the same.

But I'm stuck. Maybe I should consider that the preemphasis should not cause the spectral density to have a higher value than the original at f_m. So, G_p(f_m) ≤ G(f_m).

But G_p(f_m) = k² f_m² G(f_m).

So, k² f_m² G(f_m) ≤ G(f_m) → k² ≤ 1/f_m².

But looking at the options, none of them have 1/f_m². So, that's probably not the right approach.

Wait, perhaps the condition is that the preemphasis should not cause the spectral density to have a higher value than the original at f = 0, but that's not relevant because H_p(0) = 0, so G_p(0) = 0.

Alternatively, perhaps the condition is that the preemphasis should not cause the spectral density to have a higher amplitude at some frequency, say f = f_m, than the original.

But that would require G_p(f_m) ≤ G(f_m), leading to k² ≤ 1/f_m², which isn't among the options.

So, I must be missing something. Maybe the condition involves the integral of the spectral density, ensuring that the total energy doesn't change, but that's not directly related to bandwidth.

Alternatively, perhaps the condition is that the preemphasis doesn't cause the spectral density to have a higher amplitude at a certain frequency, say f = 2f_m, thus keeping the bandwidth the same.

So, perhaps we set G_p(2f_m) ≤ G_p(f_m).

But earlier, when I tried that, it led to an impossible condition. So, maybe instead, we set G_p(2f_m) ≤ G(f_m).

Wait, that could be a possibility. So,

k² (2f_m)^2 G(2f_m) ≤ G(f_m).

But G(2f_m) = G₀ / [1 + (2f_m/f₁)^2].

So,

k² *4f_m² * [G₀/(1 + (2f_m/f₁)^2)] ≤ G₀/(1 + (f_m/f₁)^2).

Cancel G₀ and f_m²:

4k² / [1 + (2f_m/f₁)^2] ≤ 1/[1 + (f_m/f₁)^2].

Multiply both sides by denominators:

4k² [1 + (f_m/f₁)^2] ≤ 1 + (2f_m/f₁)^2.

Expand:

4k² + 4k² (f_m/f₁)^2 ≤ 1 + 4 (f_m/f₁)^2.

Rearranged:

4k² (f_m/f₁)^2 -4k² +1 -4 (f_m/f₁)^2 ≤0.

But this seems complicated. Let me make a substitution: let x = f_m/f₁. Since f₁ <<f_m, x is large.

So,

4k² x² -4k² +1 -4x² ≤0.

Factor:

(4k² x² -4x²) + (-4k² +1) ≤0.

x²(4k² -4) + (1 -4k²) ≤0.

Factor out (4k² -4):

x²(4k² -4) + (1 -4k²) = (4k² -4)(x² -1) ≤0.

So,

(4k² -4)(x² -1) ≤0.

Since x is large (x >>1), x² -1 ≈x²>0.

So,

(4k² -4) ≤0 → 4k² ≤4 →k² ≤1.

But looking at the options, none have k² ≤1. So, this approach might be incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the condition is that the preemphasis doesn't cause the spectral density to have components beyond a certain frequency, say f = f_m + some term involving f₁.

But I'm not making progress. Given the time I've spent, perhaps I should look for a pattern in the options.

The options involve terms like 2f_m ± πf₁. Since f₁ <<f_m, 2f_m ± πf₁ ≈ 2f_m. So, the denominators are roughly 2f_m.

Looking at the options:

Option I: k² ≤ π/(f₁(2f_m - πf₁)) ≈ π/(f₁*2f_m) since πf₁ << 2f_m.

Similarly, option H is 2π/(f₁(2f_m - πf₁)) ≈ 2π/(2f₁ f_m)= π/(f₁ f_m).

Option E: 4π/(f₁ 2f_m)= 2π/(f₁ f_m).

Wait, but I'm not sure which one is correct. Alternatively, perhaps the correct condition is that k² ≤ π/(f₁ (2f_m)).

Looking at option D: k² ≤ π/(f₁ 2f_m).

Yes, that's option D.

Wait, but earlier when I thought about the condition, I thought the maximum of G_p(f) occurs at f approaching infinity, but perhaps the condition is that the preemphasis doesn't cause the spectral density to have significant components beyond a certain frequency, say f = 2f_m, and thus, the condition is derived from setting G_p(2f_m) ≤ some value.

But earlier that approach didn't yield a feasible condition. Alternatively, perhaps the condition is that the preemphasis transfer function doesn't cause the product to have a certain slope, ensuring that the bandwidth remains the same.

Alternatively, perhaps the condition arises from ensuring that the preemphasis doesn't cause the spectral density to have a higher amplitude at f = 2f_m than at f = f_m. So,

G_p(2f_m) ≤ G_p(f_m).

So,

k² (2f_m)^2 G(2f_m) ≤ k² f_m^2 G(f_m).

Cancel k²:

4 f_m^2 G(2f_m) ≤ f_m^2 G(f_m).

Divide both sides by f_m^2:

4 G(2f_m) ≤ G(f_m).

Substitute G(f) = G₀/(1 + (f/f₁)^2):

4 [G₀/(1 + (2f_m/f₁)^2)] ≤ [G₀/(1 + (f_m/f₁)^2)].

Cancel G₀:

4/(1 + (2f_m/f₁)^2) ≤ 1/(1 + (f_m/f₁)^2).

Multiply both sides by denominators:

4 [1 + (f_m/f₁)^2] ≤ 1 + (2f_m/f₁)^2.

Expand:

4 + 4(f_m/f₁)^2 ≤ 1 +4(f_m/f₁)^2.

Subtract 4(f_m/f₁)^2 from both sides:

4 ≤1, which is impossible.

So, this condition can't be met, implying that the preemphasis will always cause G_p(2f_m) > G_p(f_m), which suggests that the bandwidth would increase, which contradicts the question's requirement. Therefore, perhaps my approach is incorrect.

Given that I'm stuck, perhaps I should consider that the correct answer is option I: k² ≤ π/(f₁(2f_m - πf₁)). Because the denominator has 2f_m - πf₁, which, when f₁ <<f_m, approximates to 2f_m, making the expression roughly π/(2f₁ f_m), which seems plausible.

Alternatively, perhaps the condition is derived from ensuring that the preemphasis doesn't cause the product G_p(f) to have a certain form, leading to the given options.

After considering all possibilities, I think the correct answer is option I.

The question involves determining a suitable value of \( k^2 \) for a preemphasis circuit in an FM system such that the preemphasis does not affect the bandwidth of the channel. The transfer function of the preemphasis circuit is given as \( |H_p(f)|^2 = k^2 f^2 \), and the modulating signal has a spectral density \( G(f) = \frac{G_0}{1 + (f/f_1)^2} \), where \( f_1 \ll f_m \). The goal is to ensure that the preemphasis does not alter the bandwidth of the system.

The spectral density after preemphasis is \( G_p(f) = k^2 f^2 G(f) \). The bandwidth of an FM signal is typically determined by the highest frequency component of the modulating signal. Since the preemphasis circuit boosts higher frequencies, it could potentially extend the bandwidth if not properly designed. To prevent this, the preemphasis must be constrained such that the product \( G_p(f) \) does not introduce significant components beyond the original bandwidth.

Analyzing the options, each involves \( k^2 \) being bounded by an expression involving \( f_1 \) and \( f_m \). Given that \( f_1 \ll f_m \), terms like \( 2f_m - \pi f_1 \) approximate to \( 2f_m \). The correct condition ensures that the preemphasis does not cause the spectral density to extend beyond the original bandwidth, which is tied to the highest frequency component \( f_m \).

After considering the constraints and the form of the options, the suitable value of \( k^2 \) that ensures the preemphasis does not affect the bandwidth is given by:
