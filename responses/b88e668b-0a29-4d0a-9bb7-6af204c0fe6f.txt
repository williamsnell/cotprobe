Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what the question is. A chemist wants to dilute 50 ml of 3.50 M H2SO4 to 2.00 M H2SO4. They're asking what volume it needs to be diluted to. The options are from A to J, with various milliliters listed.

Hmm, I remember that when you dilute a solution, you're changing the concentration by adding more solvent. The key here is that the amount of solute stays the same; only the concentration changes because the volume increases. So I think I should use the dilution formula, which I believe is M1V1 = M2V2. Yeah, that sounds right. M1 is the initial molarity, V1 is the initial volume, and M2 and V2 are the final molarity and volume after dilution.

Let me write that down to keep track. The initial concentration, M1, is 3.50 M, and the initial volume, V1, is 50 ml. The final concentration, M2, is 2.00 M, and V2 is what we're trying to find.

So plugging the numbers into the formula: 3.50 M * 50 ml = 2.00 M * V2. I need to solve for V2. Let me rearrange the equation. V2 = (3.50 * 50) / 2.00.

Calculating the numerator first: 3.50 times 50. Let's see, 3 times 50 is 150, and 0.5 times 50 is 25, so 150 + 25 = 175. So the numerator is 175. Then I divide that by 2.00, which is 87.5. So V2 should be 87.5 ml.

Wait, but wait a second. The initial volume is 50 ml, and after dilution, the volume should be more than 50 ml because we're adding more solvent. So 87.5 ml is larger than 50, which makes sense. Let me double-check my calculation to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

3.50 * 50 = 175. Then 175 / 2 = 87.5. Yep, that's correct. So the final volume should be 87.5 ml. Looking at the options, option J is 87.5 ml. So the answer should be J.

Wait, but let me think again to be thorough. Another way to approach this could be by the concept of moles. The number of moles of H2SO4 before and after dilution remains the same. So moles = Molarity × Volume (in liters). So initial moles = 3.50 M × 0.05 L = 0.175 moles. After dilution, moles = 2.00 M × V2 (in liters). So 0.175 = 2.00 × V2. Solving for V2 gives V2 = 0.175 / 2.00 = 0.0875 L, which is 87.5 ml. Yep, same result. So I'm confident that J is the correct answer.

The problem involves diluting a sulfuric acid solution. Using the formula \( M_1V_1 = M_2V_2 \), where \( M_1 = 3.50 \, \text{M} \), \( V_1 = 50 \, \text{ml} \), and \( M_2 = 2.00 \, \text{M} \), we calculate \( V_2 \) as follows:

\[
V_2 = \frac{M_1 \times V_1}{M_2} = \frac{3.50 \times 50}{2.00} = 87.5 \, \text{ml}.
\]

Thus, the solution must be diluted to **87.5 ml**.

Answer: J
