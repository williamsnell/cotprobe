Okay, so I've got this logic problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about symbolizing a sentence in propositional logic (PL) using the given formulas. Let me try to break it down.

The sentence to symbolize is: "Either England's not importing beef is a necessary condition for France's subsidizing agriculture, or China promotes human rights if and only if South Africa doesn't supply diamonds."

First, I need to understand each part of the sentence. It seems to be two separate propositions connected by "or." So the structure is "Either (A) or (B)." In PL, "or" is represented by the disjunction symbol ∨. So the overall structure will probably look like (A) ∨ (B).

Let's parse each part.

Part A: "England's not importing beef is a necessary condition for France's subsidizing agriculture." 

In logic, a necessary condition is the consequent in a conditional statement. So if X is a necessary condition for Y, it translates to Y → X. So here, France's subsidizing agriculture (let's say F) is the antecedent, and England's not importing beef (~E) is the consequent. So this would be F → ~E. Wait, no, wait. Wait, necessary condition is the 'if' part. Let me think again. If A is necessary for B, then B can only happen if A happens. So B → A. So yes, France's subsidizing (F) implies England not importing beef (~E). So F → ~E. So the first part is F → ~E.

Wait, but wait, the wording says "England's not importing beef is a necessary condition for France's subsidizing." So, France's action (subsidizing) is conditional on England not importing beef. So France's action (F) can only happen if England doesn't import beef. So F → ~E. So that part is F → ~E.

Alternatively, sometimes necessary conditions are expressed as ~E ⊃ F, but no, wait. Let me clarify: If F is a consequence of ~E, then F would be the consequent. So the statement is "If France subsidizes, then England isn't importing beef." So F → ~E.

Wait, no, wait. Let me get this right. The necessary condition is for France's action. So France's action can't happen unless England isn't importing beef. So France's action (F) implies that England isn't importing beef (~E). So F → ~E.

So Part A is F → ~E.

Now, Part B: "China promotes human rights if and only if South Africa doesn't supply diamonds."

"If and only if" translates to the biconditional operator ≡. So China promotes human rights (C) if and only if South Africa doesn't supply diamonds (~S). So C ≡ ~S.

Wait, but the wording is "China promotes human rights if and only if South Africa doesn't supply diamonds." So when C is true, ~S is also true, and vice versa. So yes, C ≡ ~S.

So putting it all together, the entire sentence is (F → ~E) ∨ (C ≡ ~S). Now I need to see which option matches this structure.

Looking at the options:

Option G: (F ⊃ ~E) ∨ (C ≡ ~S) → This matches exactly what I have. So G is (F → ~E) ∨ (C ≡ ~S).

Let me check the other options to make sure I'm not missing anything.

Option A: (E ⊃ ~F) ∨ (S ≡ ~C) → E implies not F, which is not what Part A says. We have F implies ~E, so A is incorrect.

Option B: (F ⊃ E) ∨ (C ≡ ~S) → F implies E, which is the opposite of what we have (we have F → ~E), so B is wrong.

Option C: (~E ⊃ ~F) ∨ (C ⊃ S) → This would mean if not E then not F, which is F → E (contrapositive). That's not what we have; we have F → ~E. Also, the second part is C → S, which is not the biconditional. So wrong.

Option D: (~F ⊃ E) ∨ (~C ≡ S) → If not F then E, which is equivalent to F → E, which is not what we have (we have F → ~E). Also, the second part is ~C ≡ S, which is equivalent to C ≡ ~S, which is correct, but the first part is wrong, so D is incorrect.

Option E: (~F ⊃ ~E) ∨ (S ≡ ~C) → If not F then not E, which is F → E, again not matching F → ~E. So wrong.

Option F: (~E ⊃ F) ∨ (C ⊃ ~S) → If not E then F, which is E → F (contrapositive), not matching F → ~E. Also, the second part is C → ~S, which is not the biconditional. So F is wrong.

Option G: (F ⊃ ~E) ∨ (C ≡ ~S) → Correct as per my earlier analysis.

Option H: (E ⊃ F) ∨ (C ≡ S) → E implies F, which is not what Part A says. Also, the second part is C ≡ S, which is incorrect because it should be C ≡ ~S. So H is wrong.

Option I: ~(F ⊃ E) ∨ (~S ⊃ C) → The first part is the negation of F → E, which is F ∧ ~E, which doesn't match Part A. Also, the second part is ~S → C, which is not the biconditional. So I is wrong.

Option J: (F ⊃ E) ∨ (S ≡ C) → F implies E, which is wrong, and the second part is S ≡ C, which is not what we have. So J is wrong.

So after checking all options, the correct one is G.

The correct symbolization is (F → ~E) ∨ (C ≡ ~S), which corresponds to option G.

Answer: G
