Question:

Describe the path of a molecule of sugar from the time it entersthe mouth as part of a molecule of starch, until it reachesthe cytoplasm of the cells lining the small intestine.

Options:

A: The starch undergoes no change in the mouth but is broken down into glucose by the enzyme pepsin in the stomach and then absorbed in the small intestine.
B: The starch remains intact until reaching the small intestine, where it is digested by bacteria into glucose, which is then absorbed by the cells lining the small intestine.
C: The starch is dissolved in the mouth, then fermented into glucose in the large intestine, and finally transported back to the small intestine.
D: The starch is immediately hydrolyzed into glucose by saliva in the mouth and then directly enters the bloodstream without further digestion.
E: The starch is first converted to sucrose in the mouth, then to maltose in the stomach, and finally to glucose in the small intestine where it is absorbed.
F: The starch is directly absorbed into the cells lining the small intestine.
G: The starch is chewed and mixed with saliva, hydrolyzed by the enzyme amylase into maltose units, which are then hydrolyzed into glucose molecules in the small intestine, and transported into the cellular cytoplasm.
H: The starch is broken into fructose units in the mouth, then converted to glucose in the liver, and later absorbed by the cells in the small intestine.
I: The starch is converted into glucose in the mouth and then absorbed by the stomach.
J: The starch is broken down into glucose in the stomach and then absorbed by the small intestine.

Alright, let's try to figure out the correct answer to this question. So, the question is about the path a molecule of sugar takes from the mouth until it reaches the cytoplasm of the cells in the small intestine. The starting point is that it's part of a starch molecule.

First, I remember that starch is a carbohydrate, specifically a polysaccharide made up of glucose units. So, when you eat something with starch, like bread or potatoes, the process of digestion begins in the mouth.

In the mouth, there's an enzyme called amylase in the saliva that starts breaking down starch. Amylase hydrolyzes the starch into smaller molecules. I think it breaks starch into maltose, which is a disaccharide. So, after chewing and mixing with saliva, starch becomes maltose.

Then, when you swallow, the food goes into the esophagus and then the stomach. But wait, the stomach has hydrochloric acid, which would denature proteins but also affect enzymes. Since amylase is an enzyme, I think the acid would inactivate it. So, in the stomach, the breakdown of starch might slow down because the enzyme isn't active anymore. But I'm not sure if any other enzymes are present there. I remember that in the stomach, there's pepsin, which breaks down proteins, but not sure about carbohydrates.

After the stomach, the food moves into the small intestine. The small intestine is where most digestion happens. There, pancreatic amylase continues breaking down any remaining starch into maltose. Then, the intestinal brush border enzymes, like maltase, break down maltose into glucose. Oh wait, does that happen in the small intestine? Because the brush border enzymes are on the surface of the intestinal cells, so the breakdown into glucose occurs there.

So the process is: starch → mouth → broken into maltose by amylase → then in the small intestine, broken further into glucose. Then, the glucose is absorbed through the intestinal lining cells. How does it get into the cells? I think glucose is transported via specific transporters. Once inside the cell, it's in the cytoplasm.

Looking at the options, I need to match this path.

Option G says: Starch is chewed and mixed with saliva, hydrolyzed by amylase into maltose units, then hydrolyzed into glucose in the small intestine, and transported into the cellular cytoplasm. That sounds right.

Other options: Option A says pepsin breaks it down, but pepsin is for proteins, not starch. Option E talks about converting to sucrose and then maltose, not sure about that. Option J says broken into glucose in the stomach, which doesn't make sense because amylase isn't active there. Option D says it's immediately hydrolyzed into glucose in the mouth, which might be too much because amylase only does part of the breakdown. So G seems correct.

The correct answer is **G**. Here's the breakdown:

- In the mouth, starch is chewed and mixed with saliva containing amylase, which hydrolyzes starch into maltose.
- The partially digested starch (now maltose) moves to the small intestine, where pancreatic amylase and brush border enzymes further break it down into glucose.
- The glucose molecules are then absorbed into the cytoplasm of the small intestine's lining cells.

**Answer: G**
