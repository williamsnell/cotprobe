Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the order of increasing NH3 concentration based on the given equilibrium constants. Hmm, let me read through the question again to make sure I understand it correctly.

The problem gives me four complex ions with their respective dissociation reactions and equilibrium constants (k values). The task is to arrange them in order of increasing NH3 concentration that would be in equilibrium with each complex ion when starting with 1 M of each. The options are from A to J, each listing a different order of ions.

Alright, so I remember that for complex ion equilibria, the equilibrium constant (k) tells us how stable the complex is. A larger k means the complex is more stable, so it dissociates less, meaning less NH3 would be present at equilibrium because more is tied up in the complex. Conversely, a smaller k means the complex isn't very stable, so it dissociates more, leading to higher NH3 concentration in solution.

So the key here is that the smaller the k, the more the complex dissociates, which means higher NH3 concentration. Therefore, the order of increasing NH3 concentration would correspond to the order of increasing k values. Because the one with the smallest k would have the highest NH3, and the one with the largest k would have the lowest NH3.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, let me think again. Because the equilibrium is written as the complex dissociating into the metal ion and NH3. So for each reaction, the k is the dissociation constant, K_dissociation.

The formula for each reaction is: Complex ⇌ Metal²+ + NH3.

So K = [Metal²+][NH3]^n / [Complex], where n is the number of NH3 molecules in the complex.

Wait, but all the reactions here are written as the complex dissociating into the metal ion and NH3. So for each, the K is the dissociation constant, which is the same as the formation constant (Kf) but inverse. Because the formation constant is for the reaction: Metal²+ + NH3 → Complex, and Kf = 1/K_dissociation.

Wait, right. So if Kf is the formation constant, then K = 1/Kf is the dissociation constant (Kd). So a larger Kf means a more stable complex, which would mean a smaller Kd (since Kd = 1/Kf). So for Kd, a smaller value indicates a more stable complex, meaning it doesn't dissociate much, so less NH3 is produced, meaning lower [NH3] at equilibrium. Because if Kd is small, the denominator in the expression is larger, so the reaction doesn't proceed much, so [NH3] doesn't get very high.

Wait, no, wait. Let's get this straight. Let me write the general expression for each reaction.

Take reaction (1): [Cu(NH3)_4]^2+ ⇌ Cu^2+ + 4NH3; K = 1.0e-12.

So the expression is K = ([Cu^2+][NH3]^4) / [ [Cu(NH3)_4]^2+ ].

If K is small, that means the concentration of products (Cu^2+ and NH3) is low, so the complex doesn't dissociate much. So [NH3] would be lower because the complex is stable, and not much NH3 is released. Therefore, a smaller K corresponds to lower [NH3], and a larger K means more dissociation, so higher [NH3].

Wait, but wait: the problem states that we start with 1 M of each complex. So for each, the initial concentration of the complex is 1 M, and the other species (metal ion and NH3) start at zero.

So for each reaction, we can model the dissociation. Let's denote x as the amount dissociated (molarity) of the complex. Then:

For reaction (1): [Cu^2+] = x, [NH3] = 4x, and [Complex] = 1 - x ≈ 1 (since K is very small, x is tiny).

So K ≈ (x)(4x)^4 / 1 ≈ 256 x^5.

Set this equal to 1e-12: 256 x^5 ≈ 1e-12 → x^5 ≈ (1e-12)/256 ≈ 3.9e-15 → x ≈ (3.9e-15)^(1/5). Let me calculate that roughly. 1e-15^(1/5) is 1e-3, since (1e-3)^5 = 1e-15. So about 3.9e-3 → x≈ (3.9e-15)^(1/5) ≈ 3.9^(1/5) * 1e-3 ≈ roughly 1.5e-3 (since 3.9 is about cube of 1.5, but maybe a bit lower). So x is around 1.5e-3, so [NH3] is 4x ≈ 6e-3 M.

Similarly, for reaction (2): [Co(NH3)_6]^2+ ⇌ Co^2+ + 6NH3; K=4e-5.

Again, starting with 1 M complex. Let x be the dissociated amount.

So [Co^2+] = x, [NH3]=6x, [Complex]=1−x≈1.

K ≈ (x)(6x)^6 ≈ x*(6^6 x^6) = 6^6 x^7.

6^6 is 46656. So K=4e-5 = 46656 x^7 → x^7 ≈ (4e-5)/46656 ≈ 8.58e-10 → x ≈ (8.58e-10)^(1/7). Let me see: 1e-10^(1/7) is about 1e- (10/7) ≈ 1e-1.43 → ~3.7e-2. So x≈ (8.58e-10)^(1/7) → let's approximate. 2^7 is 128, 3^7 is 2187. So 8.58e-10 is about 8.58e-10 = 8.58 x 10^-10. Let me compute ln(8.58e-10)= ln(8.58)+ln(1e-10)= ~2.15 + (-23.02585)≈-20.875. Divided by 7: ≈-2.982. Exponential is e^-2.982≈0.0505. So x≈0.0505. So [NH3] =6x≈0.303 M.

Reaction (3): [Co(NH3)_6]^3+ ⇌ Co^3+ +6NH3; K=6.3e-36.

Again, K is very small, so same approach. Let x be the dissociation.

K≈x*(6x)^6 =6^6 x^7 =46656 x^7.

Set 46656 x^7 =6.3e-36 → x^7 =6.3e-36 /46656 ≈1.35e-40 → x≈ (1.35e-40)^(1/7). Let's compute that. 1e-40^(1/7) is 1e- (40/7) ≈1e-5.714≈1.94e-6. So x≈1.35^(1/7) *1.94e-6. 1.35^(1/7) is about 1.04 (since 1.04^7≈1.34). So x≈1.04 *1.94e-6≈2.0e-6. So [NH3]=6x≈1.2e-5 M.

Reaction (4): [Ag(NH3)_2]^+ ⇌ Ag^+ + 2NH3; K=6e-8.

So K = [Ag^+][NH3]^2 / [Complex]. Initial [Complex]=1 M.

Let x be the dissociation. [Ag^+]=x, [NH3]=2x, [Complex]=1-x≈1.

So K≈ (x)(2x)^2 /1 = x*4x²=4x^3.

Set 4x^3 =6e-8 → x^3=1.5e-8 → x≈(1.5e-8)^(1/3). Cube root of 1e-8 is 1e-2.666, which is 2.15e-3. So x≈(1.5)^(1/3) * 2.15e-3. 1.5^(1/3)= ~1.145. So x≈1.145e-3. Thus [NH3]=2x≈2.29e-3 M.

Now, let's list the [NH3] for each complex:

- Cu^2+: ~6e-3 M
- Co^2+: ~0.303 M
- Co^3+: ~1.2e-5 M
- Ag^+: ~2.29e-3 M

Wait, no, no, wait. Wait, I think I messed up the order of the reactions. Let me check again.

Wait, the four reactions are:

1. Cu: K=1e-12 → [NH3]=~6e-3 M
2. Co^2+: K=4e-5 → [NH3]=~0.303 M
3. Co^3+: K=6.3e-36 → [NH3]=~1.2e-5 M
4. Ag: K=6e-8 → [NH3]=~2.29e-3 M

Wait, that can't be right because for Co^3+ the K is 6.3e-36, which is much smaller than others, so [NH3] is very low, which makes sense. Similarly, for Cu, K is 1e-12, which is larger than Co^3+'s K, so [NH3] for Cu^2+ is higher than Co^3+.

Wait, no, let me list them correctly:

From [NH3] values:

Ag^+: 2.29e-3 M

Cu^2+: 6e-3 M

Co^2+: 0.303 M

Co^3+: 1.2e-5 M

Wait, no, wait. Wait, my calculations might be off, but let's proceed.

Wait, I think I made a mistake in reaction (3). Let me double-check.

Reaction (3): K=6.3e-36.

So K = [Co^3+][NH3]^6 / [ [Co(NH3)_6]^3+ ].

Assuming [Co(NH3)_6]^3+ = 1, [Co^3+] =x, [NH3]=6x.

So K ≈ x*(6x)^6 = x*(6^6 x^6) = 6^6 x^7.

So 6^6 is 46656.

So 46656 x^7 =6.3e-36 → x^7 =6.3e-36 /46656 ≈1.35e-40.

x ≈ (1.35e-40)^(1/7). Let me compute that. 1e-40 is (1e-5.714)^7, so 1e-40^(1/7)=1e-5.714 ≈ 1.9e-6.

So x≈1.35^(1/7) * 1.9e-6. 1.35^(1/7) is about 1.04 as before, so x≈1.04 *1.9e-6≈2.0e-6.

So [NH3]=6x≈1.2e-5 M.

So [NH3] for Co^3+ is ~1.2e-5, which is smaller than Cu^2+'s 6e-3.

So the order of [NH3] from lowest to highest is:

Co^3+ (1.2e-5) < Ag^+ (2.29e-3) < Cu^2+ (6e-3) < Co^2+ (0.303)

Wait, that can't be right because 2.29e-3 is less than 6e-3. So the order should be:

Co^3+ (lowest) < Ag+ < Cu^2+ < Co^2+ (highest).

So arranging them in increasing [NH3], it's Co^3+ < Ag^+ < Cu^2+ < Co^2+.

Looking at the options, let me see which option lists this order.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Ag^+, Co^2+, Co^3+, Cu^2+ → No, that's Ag first, which is not the lowest.

Option B: Cu^2+, Co^2+, Ag^+, Co^3+ → No, that's Cu^2+ first, which is higher than Ag^+.

Option C: Co^2+, Ag^+, Cu^2+, Co^3+ → No, because Co^2+ has the highest [NH3].

Option D: Co^3+, Co^2+, Ag^+, Cu^2+ → No, Co^2+ is highest, so can't be after Co^3+.

Option E: Ag^+, Cu^2+, Co^2+, Co^3+ → No, because Co^3+ should be first.

Option F: Cu^2+, Ag^+, Co^3+, Co^2+ → No, Cu^2+ is higher than Ag^+.

Option G: Co^2+, Cu^2+, Co^3+, Ag^+ → No, because Co^3+ is the lowest.

Option H: Cu^2+, Co^3+, Ag^+, Co^2+ → No, because Co^3+ is lower than Ag^+.

Option I: Co^3+, Ag^+, Cu^2+, Co^2+ → Yes! Because Co^3+ < Ag+ < Cu^2+ < Co^2+.

Option J: Ag^+, Co^3+, Cu^2+, Co^2+ → No, because Co^3+ is lower than Ag^+.

So the correct order is Co^3+ < Ag+ < Cu^2+ < Co^2+.

Looking back, the options, option I is Co^3+, Ag^+, Cu^2+, Co^2+.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the options for each choice are A through J. Let me check the options again.

Wait, looking back at the options given:

Option I: Co^3+, Ag^+, Cu^2+, Co^2+.

Yes, that's the correct order. So the answer is option I.

But wait, let me double-check. The [NH3] order is Co^3+ (1.2e-5) < Ag^+ (2.29e-3) < Cu^2+ (6e-3) < Co^2+ (0.303). So the correct order is Co^3+, Ag^+, Cu^2+, Co^2+.

Looking at the options, option I is "Co^3+, Ag^+, Cu^2+, Co^2+". So that's the correct order.

The problem involves determining the order of increasing NH3 concentration in equilibrium with four metal-ammonia complexes, given their dissociation constants (K). The equilibrium constants indicate the stability of the complexes: smaller K values correspond to less dissociation, meaning less NH3 is released into the solution. Starting with 1 M of each complex, the task is to calculate the NH3 concentration for each and arrange them in increasing order.

### Analysis of Each Reaction:
1. **Cu(NH3)4²⁺ ⇌ Cu²⁺ + 4NH3 (K = 1.0 × 10⁻¹²):**
   - Using the dissociation constant, the NH3 concentration is calculated to be approximately **6 × 10⁻³ M**.

2. **Co(NH3)6²⁺ ⇌ Co²⁺ + 6NH3 (K = 4.0 × 10⁻⁵):**
   - The NH3 concentration is calculated to be approximately **0.303 M**.

3. **Co(NH3)6³⁺ ⇌ Co³⁺ + 6NH3 (K = 6.3 × 10⁻³⁶):**
   - The NH3 concentration is calculated to be approximately **1.2 × 10⁻⁵ M**.

4. **Ag(NH3)₂⁺ ⇌ Ag⁺ + 2NH3 (K = 6.0 × 10⁻⁸):**
   - The NH3 concentration is calculated to be approximately **2.29 × 10⁻³ M**.

### Order of NH3 Concentration:
From the calculations, the NH3 concentrations are:
- **Co³⁺:** 1.2 × 10⁻⁵ M (lowest)
- **Ag⁺:** 2.29 × 10⁻³ M
- **Cu²⁺:** 6 × 10⁻³ M
- **Co²⁺:** 0.303 M (highest)

Thus, the order of increasing NH3 concentration is: **Co³⁺ < Ag⁺ < Cu²⁺ < Co²⁺**.

### Correct Option:
The correct option that matches this order is **I: Co³⁺, Ag⁺, Cu²⁺, Co²⁺**.

**Answer: I**
