Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about a free particle, right? It has a mass of 20 grams and is initially at rest. Then, a force of 100 dynes is applied for 10 seconds. I need to find out the kinetic energy it acquires. The options are from A to J, all in ergs.

Alright, first, I remember that when a force is applied over time, it causes an impulse, which changes the momentum of the object. Oh wait, impulse equals force multiplied by time, right? So impulse J = F * t. But wait, I also know that impulse equals the change in momentum, which is mass times velocity, Δp = mΔv. Since the particle starts from rest, the initial velocity is zero, so the change in velocity is just the final velocity. So, J = m * v.

Let me write down the values. The mass m is 20 grams. Oh wait, grams to kilograms? Wait, in the metric system, 1 gram is 0.001 kg, but wait, the force is given in dynes and energy in ergs, which are CGS units. So maybe I don't need to convert to SI units. Because 1 dyne is the force that accelerates 1 gram at 1 cm/s². So perhaps I can work in grams and cm.

So, mass m = 20 grams. Force F = 100 dynes. Time t = 10 seconds.

So, impulse J = F * t = 100 dynes * 10 s = 1000 dynes·s. Since 1 dyne·s is the unit of impulse, same as gram·cm/s, because F is dynes which is gram·cm/s², so F*t would be gram·cm/s.

So J = 1000 gram·cm/s. And J is also m*v. So 1000 = m*v. m is 20 grams, so v = J/m = 1000 /20 = 50 cm/s.

Now, kinetic energy KE is (1/2) m v². But wait, I need to make sure the units are correct here. Since we're using CGS units, KE would be in ergs. Because 1 erg is 1 gram·cm²/s².

So m is 20 grams, v is 50 cm/s. So KE = 0.5 * 20 * (50)^2.

Let me calculate that. 50 squared is 2500. So 0.5 *20 =10. 10 * 2500 =25,000 ergs.

Wait, looking at the options, option A is 25,000 ergs. So that should be the answer. But wait, did I make any mistakes?

Wait, let me double-check the impulse part. Impulse is F*t, which is force (dynes) multiplied by time (seconds). So 100 *10=1000 dyne·s. And since impulse is also m*v, which is 20g * v. So v =1000/20=50 cm/s. Correct.

Then KE = ½ m v². Plugging in, ½ *20*(50)^2. 50 squared is 2500. 20 times 2500 is 50,000. Half of that is 25,000 ergs. So yeah, A is the correct answer.

Wait, but wait another thing. The mass was given in grams, so 20 grams. So m =20 g. So when I compute KE, it's (1/2)*20g*(50 cm/s)^2. Since 1 g·cm²/s² is 1 erg, that's correct. So yes, 25,000 ergs.
