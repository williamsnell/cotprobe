Okay, so I have this percentage problem here: What percent of 0.65% is 0.42%? Hmm, I think I remember that to find what percentage one number is of another, I can use the formula: (part/whole) * 100%. 

Wait, let me make sure. So in this case, the "part" is 0.42% and the "whole" is 0.65%. So applying the formula, it should be (0.42 / 0.65) * 100%. 

Let me calculate that. 0.42 divided by 0.65 equals... Let me do the division. 0.65 goes into 0.42 how many times? Well, 0.65 times 0.666 would be approximately 0.42. Wait, maybe I should compute it more accurately. 

Alternatively, maybe I can convert both percentages to decimals first. So 0.65% is 0.0065 in decimal, and 0.42% is 0.0042. But wait, no, that's not right. Oh wait, no: 0.42% is 0.0042 in decimal, and 0.65% is 0.0065. So the formula becomes (0.0042 / 0.0065) * 100%.

Hmm, let me compute that. 0.0042 divided by 0.0065. Let's simplify this. If I multiply numerator and denominator by 1000 to eliminate the decimals, it becomes 4.2 / 6.5. 

Now, dividing 4.2 by 6.5. Let me think: 6.5 times 0.666 is about 4.33. Wait, but 6.5 times 0.6666 is approximately 4.333. So 4.2 divided by 6.5 is about 0.646. 

Wait, let me do it step by step. 6.5 times 0.6 is 3.9. 6.5 times 0.66 is 4.29. Wait, but 4.2 is less than that. So 0.66 would give 4.29, which is more than 4.2. So maybe 0.646 is the right value. 

So 0.646 times 100% gives 64.6%. Looking at the options, option I is 64.6%. So the answer should be option I. 

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes I get confused with decimal places. Let me do 4.2 divided by 6.5. 

Alternatively, let's compute 42 divided by 65. Since 65 goes into 42 zero times, add a decimal point and a zero, making it 420. 65 times 6 is 390. Subtract, you get 30. Bring down another zero: 300. 65 goes into 300 four times (65*4=260). Subtract to get 40. Bring down another zero: 400. 65 goes into 400 six times (65*6=390). Subtract, get 10. Bring down another zero: 100. 65 goes into 100 once (65), remainder 35. Bring down another zero: 350. 65 goes into 350 five times (325). So now the quotient is 0.64615... So approximately 0.646, which is 64.6%. 

So yes, the correct percentage is 64.6%, which is option I.

The correct answer is I: 64.6%.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Identify the Formula:** To find what percent one number is of another, use the formula: (part/whole) Ã— 100%. Here, the part is 0.42% and the whole is 0.65%.

2. **Apply the Formula:** 
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{0.42\%}{0.65\%} \right) \times 100\%
   \]

3. **Simplify the Calculation:**
   - Convert percentages to decimals:
     \[
     0.42\% = 0.0042 \quad \text{and} \quad 0.65\% = 0.0065
     \]
   - Compute the division:
     \[
     \frac{0.0042}{0.0065} = \frac{4.2}{6.5} \approx 0.646
     \]

4. **Convert Back to Percentage:** Multiply by 100%:
   \[
   0.646 \times 100\% = 64.6\%
   \]

5. **Match to Options:** Option I corresponds to 64.6%.

Answer: I. 64.6%
