Question:

Why is it that in most ecological successions the last stageis longlasting?

Options:

A: The climax stage is characterized by rapid species turnover and high instability
B: Successional stages progress more rapidly as they approach the climax stage
C: Climax community is more prone to environmental changes
D: Climax communities are less resilient to disturbances
E: Climax community is more stable, has complex organization, larger organic structure, and more balanced metabolism
F: Climax communities are dominated by early-successional species
G: Climax stage is short-lived
H: Climax communities are static and unchanging
I: Climax communities have fewer species and simpler interactions
J: Each successional stage is equally likely to be long-lasting

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about ecological successions, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let me think through it step by step.

The question is asking why the last stage in most ecological successions is long-lasting. The options are from A to J, and I need to choose the correct one.

First, I remember that ecological succession is the process of change in the species composition of an ecosystem over time, until a relatively stable climax community is established. The stages of succession include pioneer communities, which are the first to colonize an area, and then they gradually change until reaching the climax stage.

I also recall that the climax community is the final stage, which is relatively stable and persists over time. It's usually characterized by a complex structure, a high level of biodiversity, and it's more resistant to disturbances. So, the last stage being long-lasting must be because of these characteristics.

Looking at the options:

Option A says the climax stage has rapid species turnover and high instability. That doesn't sound right because if there's high instability, the community wouldn't last long.

Option B suggests that successional stages speed up as they approach the climax. I think earlier stages might have more rapid changes, but climax is more stable, so this might not be correct.

Option C claims the climax community is more prone to environmental changes. That doesn't seem right because climax communities are usually more resilient, not more prone.

Option D says climax communities are less resilient. No, I think they're more resilient, so this is probably incorrect.

Option E states the climax community is more stable with complex organization, larger organic structure, and balanced metabolism. This aligns with what I remember. Climax communities are stable and have complex systems, making them last longer.

Option F says climax is dominated by early species. No, early-successional species are the ones that come first, like grasses and shrubs, while climax often includes trees and more complex organisms.

Option G says the climax stage is short-lived, which directly contradicts the idea of it being the last and longest-lasting stage.

Option H claims climax communities are static and unchanging. While they are stable, they can still have some changes, but they are more resistant to big changes. Static might not be the best term, but it's closer than others.

Option I says climax has fewer species and simpler interactions. No, climax usually has more species and complex interactions, so this is wrong.

Option J suggests each stage is equally likely to be long-lasting. That doesn't make sense because the climax stage is known to persist much longer.

So, putting it all together, the correct answer should be E. It accurately describes why the climax community is the last and longest stage because of its stability and complexity.

The last stage of ecological succession being long-lasting is due to the characteristics of the climax community, which is more stable, has a complex organization, a larger organic structure, and a more balanced metabolism. These features make it resilient and resistant to disturbances, allowing it to persist over time.

Answer: E
