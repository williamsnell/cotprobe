Okay, so I have this economics problem here about price elasticity of demand. Hmm, I remember that elasticity measures how responsive the quantity demanded is to a change in price. The formula I think is percentage change in quantity demanded divided by percentage change in price. Oh wait, but I might have it the other way around. No, no, elasticity is (ΔQ/Q)/(ΔP/P), so it's (ΔQ/ΔP) * (P/Q). Right.

The question gives me two points: at price q, quantity demanded is 11, and at price 11, quantity demanded is 9. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Wait, the first part says Price = $q, QD =11. Then at Price=$11, QD=9. So the two points are (q,11) and (11,9). So when price increases from q to 11, quantity demanded decreases from 11 to 9. So the change in price is (11 - q), and the change in quantity is (9 -11) = -2.

Wait, but I don't know what q is. Hmm, maybe I'm supposed to calculate the elasticity for different bases. The question has three parts: a) use P=9, Q=11 as base; b) P=11, Q=9 as base; c) average values as base.

Wait, but wait, the given points are at (q,11) and (11,9). So I think I need to find the elasticity using different base points.

Wait, maybe the first part is when the base is P=9, Q=11. But wait, the given points are P=q and P=11. So I'm a bit confused. Maybe I should think that q is the original price, and the new price is 11, so the change is from P=q to P=11, and Q goes from 11 to 9.

Wait, perhaps I should plot these points. Let me write down the two points: (q, 11) and (11,9). So when the price increases from q to 11, quantity demanded decreases from 11 to 9. So the change in price is 11 - q, and the change in quantity is 9 -11 = -2.

But I don't know what q is. Wait, maybe q is 9? Because when P=9, QD=11? Oh wait, no, the given points are at P=q, Q=11 and P=11, Q=9. So perhaps the points are (q,11) and (11,9), and we need to find the elasticity using different base points.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's see the problem again. The question asks to find the elasticity using a) P=9, Q=11 as base, b) P=11, Q=9 as base, c) average values as base.

Wait, but the given data is at P=q, Q=11 and P=11, Q=9. So perhaps q is 9? Because when P=9, Q=11, and when P=11, Q=9. That makes sense. So the two points are (9,11) and (11,9). So the change in price is 11-9=2, and the change in quantity is 9-11= -2.

Wait, that's a big hint. So the percentage change in price is (2/9)*100, and percentage change in quantity is (-2/11)*100. But wait, when calculating elasticity, we take the absolute value of the percentage change in quantity over percentage change in price. So the elasticity would be (2/11)/(2/9) = (2/11)*(9/2) )= 9/11 ≈ 0.818. So the elasticity is about 0.818, which is less than 1, so demand is inelastic.

Wait, but that's using the average values as the base, maybe. Or perhaps using one of the given points as the base.

Wait, no, let me clarify. The formula for price elasticity of demand (PED) is:

PED = (ΔQ / ΔP) * (P / Q)

But it's usually calculated as the absolute value of (percentage change in quantity demanded divided by percentage change in price). So percentage change in Q is (Q2 - Q1)/Q1, and percentage change in P is (P2 - P1)/P1. So PED = |(ΔQ/Q1)/(ΔP/P1)| = |(ΔQ/ΔP)*(P1/Q1)|.

Wait, but sometimes it's calculated using the average values for P and Q to get a more accurate estimate, especially over a linear demand curve where elasticity varies along the curve.

So for part a), using P=9, Q=11 as the base. So P1=9, Q1=11. The new point is P2=11, Q2=9. So ΔQ = 9-11 = -2. ΔP =11-9=2.

So percentage change in Q is (-2)/11 ≈ -18.18%. Percentage change in P is 2/9 ≈ 22.22%. So PED = (|-18.18% / 22.22%|) = 0.818. So PED ≈ 0.818 <1, so demand is inelastic. So part a) is inelastic.

Part b) uses P=11, Q=9 as the base. So P1=11, Q1=9. P2=9, Q2=11. So ΔQ=11-9=2, ΔP=9-11=-2.

Percentage change in Q: 2/9 ≈ 22.22%. Percentage change in P: (-2)/11 ≈ -18.18%. So PED = 22.22% / 18.18% ≈ 1.222. Wait, that's greater than 1, so demand is elastic. But wait, wait, no. Because when using P=11 as the base, the change in P is from 11 to 9, which is a decrease of 2, so ΔP is -2, but the percentage change is (-2)/11 ≈ -18.18%. So the percentage change in Q is (2)/9 ≈ 22.22%. So PED is 22.22 / 18.18 ≈ 1.222, which is greater than 1, so demand is elastic. Wait, but that's conflicting with part a). So part a) is inelastic, part b) is elastic.

Wait, but that can't be right because the demand curve is linear, and the elasticity should vary between the two points. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Let me recalculate part a). Using P=9, Q=11 as base. P increases to 11, Q decreases to 9. So ΔQ is -2, ΔP is +2. So percentage change in Q: (-2)/11 ≈ -18.18%. Percentage change in P: 2/9 ≈ 22.22%. So PED is (18.18/22.22) ≈ 0.818 <1, so inelastic.

In part b), using P=11, Q=9 as base. P decreases to 9, Q increases to 11. ΔQ = +2, ΔP = -2. So percentage change in Q: 2/9 ≈22.22%. Percentage change in P: (-2)/11 ≈-18.18%. So PED is (22.22/18.18) ≈1.222>1, so elastic.

Wait, but that's interesting. So depending on which base we use, the elasticity changes. So part a) is inelastic, part b) is elastic.

For part c), using average values. So the average price is (9+11)/2 = 10. The average quantity is (11+9)/2 =10. So P_avg=10, Q_avg=10.

So the percentage change in Q is (9-11)/10 = (-2)/10 = -20%. Percentage change in P is (11-9)/10= 2/10=20%. So PED= |(-20%) / 20%|=1. So unitary elastic.

Wait, but wait, that's when using average values. So part c) is unitary elastic.

Wait, but let me check again. Because when using average values, the formula is:

ΔQ_avg = (Q2 - Q1)/2 = (9-11)/2 = -1. Similarly, ΔP_avg = (11-9)/2=+1. Then, percentage change in Q is (-1)/10 = -10%, and percentage change in P is 1/10=10%. So PED=10%/10% =1. So unitary elastic.

Wait, that's conflicting with my earlier calculation. Wait, no, I think I made a mistake earlier. Because when using average values, the percentage changes are calculated relative to the average, not the base. So let me recalculate.

Wait, when using average values, the base is the average. So P_avg = (9+11)/2 =10, Q_avg=(11+9)/2=10.

So the change in P is 11-9=2, so average P is 10. So percentage change in P is 2/10=20%.

Similarly, change in Q is 9-11= -2, average Q is 10. So percentage change in Q is -2/10= -20%.

So PED = |(-20%)/(20%)|=1.

So for part c), the elasticity is unitary.

So summarizing:

a) Using P=9, Q=11 as base: PED≈0.818 → inelastic.

b) Using P=11, Q=9 as base: PED≈1.222 → elastic.

c) Using average values: PED=1 → unitary.

Wait, but looking at the options, let's see which one matches.

Option H: a) inelastic, b) elastic, c) unitary. So H is a match.

Wait, but looking at the options:

Option H says a) inelastic, b) elastic, c) unitary.

So that's what I've got. So the answer should be H.

The problem involves calculating the price elasticity of demand (PED) using different base points. The given points are (P=9, Q=11) and (P=11, Q=9). The formula for PED is:

\[
PED = \left| \frac{\text{Percentage change in quantity demanded}}{\text{Percentage change in price}} \right|
\]

### Part a) Using P=9, Q=11 as the base:
- **Base values**: P₁ = 9, Q₁ = 11.
- **New values**: P₂ = 11, Q₂ = 9.
- **Change in quantity**: ΔQ = Q₂ - Q₁ = 9 - 11 = -2.
- **Change in price**: ΔP = P₂ - P₁ = 11 - 9 = 2.
- **Percentage change in quantity**: \(\frac{-2}{11} \approx -18.18\%\).
- **Percentage change in price**: \(\frac{2}{9} \approx 22.22\%\).
- **PED**: \(\left| \frac{-18.18\%}{22.22\%} \right| \approx 0.818 < 1\), so demand is **inelastic**.

### Part b) Using P=11, Q=9 as the base:
- **Base values**: P₁ = 11, Q₁ = 9.
- **New values**: P₂ = 9, Q₂ = 11.
- **Change in quantity**: ΔQ = Q₂ - Q₁ = 11 - 9 = 2.
- **Change in price**: ΔP = P₂ - P₁ = 9 - 11 = -2.
- **Percentage change in quantity**: \(\frac{2}{9} \approx 22.22\%\).
- **Percentage change in price**: \(\frac{-2}{11} \approx -18.18\%\).
- **PED**: \(\left| \frac{22.22\%}{-18.18\%} \right| \approx 1.222 > 1\), so demand is **elastic**.

### Part c) Using average values as the base:
- **Average price**: \(P_{\text{avg}} = \frac{9 + 11}{2} = 10\).
- **Average quantity**: \(Q_{\text{avg}} = \frac{11 + 9}{2} = 10\).
- **Change in quantity**: ΔQ = 9 - 11 = -2.
- **Change in price**: ΔP = 11 - 9 = 2.
- **Percentage change in quantity**: \(\frac{-2}{10} = -20\%\).
- **Percentage change in price**: \(\frac{2}{10} = 20\%\).
- **PED**: \(\left| \frac{-20\%}{20\%} \right| = 1\), so demand is **unitarily elastic**.

### Conclusion:
- **a)** Demand is inelastic.
- **b)** Demand is elastic.
- **c)** Demand is unitarily elastic.

The correct option is **H**.
