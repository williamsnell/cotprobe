Alright, so I've got this probability problem to solve. Let me read it again and try to understand what it's asking.

The question is about four packages being delivered to four houses, each getting one package. The deliveries are random, and we need to find the probability that exactly two packages end up at the correct houses. The options are given from A to J, and I need to choose the correct one as a common fraction.

Hmm, okay. So probability is about favorable outcomes over total possible outcomes. So first, I should figure out what the total number of possible ways the packages can be delivered is. Since each package can go to any of the four houses, but each house gets exactly one package, this is essentially the number of permutations of four items. I remember that the number of permutations of n items is n factorial, which is n! So for four packages, that's 4! = 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 24. So there are 24 possible ways the packages can be delivered.

Now, the favorable outcomes are those where exactly two packages are delivered correctly, and the other two are incorrect. So I need to count how many such permutations exist where exactly two are correct and the other two are wrong.

Wait, how do I calculate that? I think this is a problem involving derangements. A derangement is a permutation where none of the items are in their correct positions. But here, we have exactly two correct and two incorrect. So maybe I can approach it by first choosing which two are correct, and then ensuring the other two are deranged.

Let me think. So, first, I need to choose 2 out of the 4 packages to be correctly delivered. The number of ways to choose these two is given by the combination formula, which is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!). So for n=4 and k=2, that's C(4,2) = 6. So there are six ways to choose which two packages are correctly delivered.

Now, for the remaining two packages, they must not be delivered correctly. So we need to find the number of derangements for two items. I know that for two items, the number of derangements is 1. Because if you have two items, say A and B, the only derangement is swapping them: A→B and B→A. So D(2) = 1.

Wait, is that right? Let me double-check. For two items, the possible permutations are:
1. A→A, B→B (both correct, which is not a derangement)
2. A→B, B→A (both incorrect, which is the only derangement possible)
So yes, D(2) = 1.

So for each of the six ways of choosing the two correct packages, there's exactly one way to derange the other two. So the total number of favorable permutations is 6 × 1 = 6.

Wait, so there are six favorable outcomes where exactly two packages are delivered correctly.

Therefore, the probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. So that would be 6 / 24.

Simplifying that, 6 divided by 24 is 1/4. So the probability is 1/4.

Wait a minute, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Another way to think about this is using derangements for the remaining two. Let me check if D(2) is indeed 1. Yes, as I thought earlier, for two items, only one derangement exists.

Alternatively, I can list all possible permutations of four items and count those with exactly two fixed points. But that might be time-consuming, but maybe for a small number like four, it's manageable.

Let's list all 24 permutations of four elements (let's denote them as 1,2,3,4) and count how many have exactly two fixed points.

Wait, but that might take too long, but perhaps I can think of it another way. The formula for the number of permutations with exactly k fixed points is given by C(n, k) × D(n - k). So in this case, n=4, k=2, so it's C(4,2) × D(2) = 6 × 1 = 6, which matches what I found earlier.

So the probability is 6/24 = 1/4, which is option D.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm not confusing this with the number of derangements for four items. The total number of derangements of four items is D(4) = 9. But that's for zero correct, not two. So that's a different scenario.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as inclusion-exclusion. The number of ways exactly two are correct is C(4,2) multiplied by the number of derangements of the remaining two. Which again gives 6 × 1 = 6. So 6/24 = 1/4.

So I think I'm confident that the probability is 1/4, which is option D.

The total number of ways to deliver the packages is 4! = 24. To find the number of favorable outcomes where exactly two packages are correctly delivered, we first choose 2 out of 4 packages to be correct, which is C(4,2) = 6. For the remaining two packages, they must be deranged, and there's only 1 derangement for two items. Thus, the number of favorable outcomes is 6 × 1 = 6. The probability is therefore 6/24 = 1/4.
