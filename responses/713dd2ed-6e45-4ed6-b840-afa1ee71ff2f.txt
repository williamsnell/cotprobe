Question:

Which statement best describes the relationship between realist international relations theorists and peace researchers in the early 1960s?

Options:

A: Peace researchers and realists were in full agreement on the focus of their studies, both advocating for a reduction in nuclear arms as the best path to peace.
B: Although peace researchers were critical of the realist focus on military strength, both groups agreed that the Soviet bloc posed a significant threat to Western liberal democracies.
C: Realists and peace researchers shared the same views and advocated for disarmament and peaceful coexistence as the best way to resolve the East-West divide of the Cold War.
D: Whilst peace researchers indentified the escalation of the arms race as a result of failures by the League of Nations, realist scholars deemed it to be the natural progression of ideological differences between the Soviet bloc and Western liberal democracies. This resulted in irreconcilable differences between the study agendas of realists and peace researchers.
E: The East-West divide of the Cold War gave rise to a sharp divide between realists and early peace studies theorists. Whilst realists wished to focus research on that which would favour the survival of Western liberal democracies, advocates of peace studies regarded this approach as being narrow and Western ethnocentric.
F: Both peace researchers and realists advocated an academic focus on the escalation of the arms race. Although tensions existed between the groups in terms of their proposed solutions to this crisis, there existed a consensus that the Soviet bloc should be eliminated as a nuclear threat, thus favouring the survival of Western liberal democracies.
G: Realists and peace researchers had a common goal of promoting peace, but differed significantly in their approaches, with the former advocating for military supremacy and the latter for diplomacy and negotiation.
H: The realist school and peace researchers had minor disagreements on their study agendas, but both believed in the importance of maintaining a balance of power to achieve security.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which answer best describes the relationship between realist international relations theorists and peace researchers in the early 1960s. I'm a bit new to this topic, so I'll need to break it down step by step.

First, I should understand what realist international relations theory entails. From what I remember, realism in IR emphasizes the anarchic nature of the international system, where states are primarily concerned with their own survival and power. Realists believe that international politics is driven by the pursuit of power and interests, often leading to conflict. They advocate for a balance of power to maintain security and stability.

On the other hand, peace researchers, especially in the context of the early 1960s during the Cold War, are likely focused on finding ways to reduce conflict and promote cooperation between nations. Their approach might be more idealistic, perhaps leaning towards diplomacy, dialogue, and disarmament as means to achieve peace.

Now, looking at the options, I need to find which one captures the relationship between these two groups. Let's go through each option one by one.

Option A: Both agreed on reducing nuclear arms as the path to peace. I'm not sure if realists would have agreed with this. Realists might have been more cautious about disarmament, possibly seeing it as weakening their own state's security. So maybe A is not correct.

Option B: They both agreed that the Soviet bloc was a significant threat but peace researchers were critical of the realist focus on military strength. This seems plausible. Realists would see military strength as necessary to counter the Soviet threat, while peace researchers might argue for other approaches but still recognize the threat.

Option C: Both shared views on disarmament and peaceful coexistence. Again, realists might not fully agree with disarmament if they think it could weaken their position. So C might not be accurate.

Option D: Peace researchers linked arms race to League of Nations failures, while realists saw it as ideological differences. I'm not too familiar with the League's role here, but I think this might be stretching it. The Cold War's arms race was more about ideological differences between capitalism and communism, so maybe D is mixing things up.

Option E: The Cold War divide caused a split. Realists focused on survival of Western democracies, while peace researchers saw this as narrow and ethnocentric. This makes sense because realists would prioritize their own side's survival, while peace researchers might take a more global or neutral stance, possibly critical of realists' approach.

Option F: Both focused on the arms race but disagreed on solutions. This could be true, but the part about eliminating the Soviet bloc as a nuclear threat sounds more like a realist stance. Peace researchers might not agree with eliminating the Soviet threat but rather reducing it through other means.

Option G: Common goal of peace but differing approaches. Realists with military supremacy, peace researchers with diplomacy. This seems accurate because both want peace but have different methods.

Option H: Minor disagreements but both believe in balance of power. Realists might believe in balance of power, but peace researchers might argue for other means like disarmament, so H might not capture the full picture.

Now, considering the time frame—early 1960s—this was during the Cold War, a time of high tension between the US and the Soviet Union. Realists would be pushing for a strong military to counter the Soviet threat, possibly advocating for containment. Peace researchers, on the other hand, might be more about diplomacy and reducing arms, perhaps influenced by the horrors of nuclear war.

Looking back at the options, E says that realists wanted to focus on what favors Western survival, while peace researchers saw this as narrow and ethnocentric. This seems to capture the divide well. Realists were more about the survival of their own side, while peace researchers might have a broader, more critical view.

Option G also seems good, but it's more about their approaches rather than the underlying motivation. E goes deeper into the motivation and critique.

So, I think the best answer is E because it highlights the fundamental difference in their approaches and motivations during that time.

The relationship between realist international relations theorists and peace researchers in the early 1960s was marked by a significant divide, particularly influenced by the Cold War tensions. Realists focused on the survival of Western liberal democracies, advocating for military strength and the containment of the Soviet bloc. In contrast, peace researchers critiqued this approach as narrow and ethnocentric, instead promoting diplomacy and disarmament. This reflects their differing priorities and methods in addressing the East-West divide.

Answer: E
