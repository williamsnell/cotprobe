Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this statistics question. Let me read it again and think through it step by step. 

The question says that researchers are conducting an experiment with a significance level of 0.05. The null hypothesis is actually false. They decide to modify their experiment by using twice as many experimental units for each treatment. I need to figure out what happens to the probability of Type I and Type II errors, as well as the power of the test.

First, let me recall some basic concepts. The significance level, often denoted as alpha (α), is the probability of committing a Type I error, which is rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true. In this case, though, the null hypothesis is false, so the researchers are in a situation where the alternative hypothesis (H₁) is true. 

Power is the probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis when it is false. It's calculated as 1 minus the probability of a Type II error (β). So, power = 1 - β. 

Now, Type II error is failing to reject the null hypothesis when it's actually false. So, if the power increases, the probability of a Type II error decreases, and vice versa.

The experiment is being modified by doubling the number of experimental units. I remember that increasing the sample size generally affects both Type I and Type II errors. Let's break it down.

Increasing the sample size (n) affects the standard error of the mean. The standard error is inversely proportional to the square root of n. So, with a larger n, the standard error decreases, making the sampling distribution of the test statistic more precise. This leads to a narrower distribution around the true mean.

When the sample size increases, the power of the test increases. Why? Because with a larger sample, you have a better chance of detecting an effect if there is one. So the probability of a Type II error (β) decreases because power (1 - β) goes up.

But what about the significance level (α)? The significance level is set by the researchers and is the probability of Type I error. Changing the sample size doesn't affect α directly because α is determined by the cutoff (e.g., p < 0.05) and isn't influenced by the sample size. So, if they keep the significance level at 0.05, the probability of Type I error remains the same.

Wait, but wait a second. Could changing the sample size affect the Type I error rate indirectly? I think no, because Type I error rate is controlled by α, which isn't changed here. They're just using more units, not altering the significance level. So α stays the same.

So putting it together: when they double the sample size, the power increases because the test is more sensitive. This means the probability of Type II error decreases. The Type I error rate (α) remains unchanged because it's set at 0.05 and hasn't been altered.

Looking at the options:

A: Both Type I and power increase. No, because Type I stays same.

B: Both Type I and Type II decrease. No, Type I stays same, Type II decreases.

C: Type I same, power increases. Yes, that fits.

D: Type II decreases, power same. No, because power increases.

E: Type I decreases, Type II increases. No, Type I same, Type II decreases.

F: Both Type II and power increase. No, Type II decreases.

G: Power and Type II both decrease. No, power increases, Type II decreases.

H: Type I increases, power decreases. No, Type I same, power increases.

I: Power same, Type II decreases. No, power increases.

J: Both Type I and Type II increase. No.

So the correct answer should be option C: The probability of a Type I error would stay the same and the power would increase.

When the sample size is doubled, the power of the test increases because a larger sample size allows for a more precise estimate, reducing the standard error and making it easier to detect an effect if the null hypothesis is false. The probability of a Type II error decreases as a result. The significance level (α) remains unchanged at 0.05, so the probability of a Type I error stays the same.

Answer: C
