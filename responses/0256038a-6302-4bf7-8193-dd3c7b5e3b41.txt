Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question says: When an increase in speed doubles the momentum of a moving body, what happens to its kinetic energy? The options are A through J, with various possibilities like decreases, increases, remains same, etc.

Hmm. I remember that momentum and kinetic energy are related but different concepts. Let me think about the formulas. Momentum (p) is mass times velocity, so p = mv. Kinetic energy (KE) is (1/2)mv². 

The problem states that the speed increases, causing the momentum to double. So, if originally the momentum was p = mv, after the increase, it becomes 2p. Let me denote the initial speed as v and the final speed as v'. So, initial momentum is mv, final is m*v'. 

Given that the momentum doubles, so m*v' = 2mv. I can cancel the mass m (assuming it's constant) to get v' = 2v. So the speed doubles.

Now, what about kinetic energy? Initially, KE_initial is (1/2)mv². After the speed doubles, KE_final becomes (1/2)m(v')² = (1/2)m(2v)² = (1/2)m*4v² = 4*(1/2)mv² = 4 KE_initial.

Wait, that means the kinetic energy quadruples. So the KE becomes four times the original. But wait, the options don't have E as the correct answer? Let me check the options again.

Options are A to J. Option E is "quadruples," which would match what I just calculated. But wait, the initial question says the speed increases, doubling the momentum. So speed doubles, momentum doubles, and KE quadruples. So the answer should be E.

Wait a second, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's go through it again. If v' = 2v, then KE_final is (1/2)m*(2v)^2 = (1/2)m*4v² = 4*(1/2 mv²) = 4 KE_initial. Yep, that's correct. So the KE increases four times, which is quadruples.

Looking at the options, E is quadruples. So the correct answer should be E.

When the speed doubles, the momentum doubles, and the kinetic energy quadruples. 

Answer: E
