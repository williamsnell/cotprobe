Question:

A highway patrol officer stopped a driver for speeding and found that the person had a suspended license. He allowed her husband to drive the car home but arrested her for driving under suspension. After securing her inside the squad car, he conducted a search of her vehicle. The officer found a bag of cocaine inside a zippered jacket on the back seat. He arrested her for possession and possession with intent to deliver a controlled substance. Prior to trial, the driver moved for suppression of the cocaine. Is it likely that the trial court will grant the suppression motion?

Options:

A: Yes, the motion will be granted because a search of a vehicle requires a search warrant unless there are exceptional exigent circumstances.
B: Yes, the motion will be granted because the officer did not have the driver's consent to search the car.
C: No, the motion will be denied because the officer had the right to search the car for officer safety reasons.
D: No, the motion will be denied because the officer had a reasonable suspicion to search the car due to the driver's suspended license.
E: No, the motion will be denied because the officer had probable cause to search the car after finding out about the suspended license.
F: No, the motion will be denied because this was a valid search incident to an arrest.
G: Yes, it must be suppressed because she was secured in the squad car and the police could not expect to find evidence relating to the current arrest in the car.
H: Yes, the motion will be granted because the cocaine was found in a personal item, not in plain sight.
I: No, the motion will be denied because there is no expectation of privacy toward property inside one's car.
J: Yes, the motion will be granted because the officer did not have a warrant to search the jacket on the back seat.

Okay, let's break this down. So, the question is about whether the suppression motion will be granted in a criminal case involving the search of a vehicle. The scenario is that a highway patrol officer stops a driver for speeding and finds she has a suspended license. The officer allows her husband to drive home but arrests her. After securing her in a squad car, he searches the vehicle and finds cocaine in a jacket on the back seat. The driver moved to suppress the cocaine evidence.

I need to figure out if the court will grant the suppression motion. The options are A through J, each giving a different reason.

First, I should recall the Fourth Amendment, which protects against unreasonable searches and seizures. Generally, a search requires a warrant, but there are exceptions like consent, searches incident to arrest, and others.

In this case, the officer arrested the driver and secured her in the squad car. Then he searched her vehicle. The key here is whether the search was legal.

One exception is the search incident to arrest. Under the automobile exception, police can search a vehicle without a warrant if it's reasonable to believe the vehicle contains evidence and if it's movable. But wait, the driver was already secured. So, the car's mobility might not be a factor here.

Another point is that the officer didn't have the driver's consent to search the car. The driver was arrested, so she might not have been in a position to consent. But the husband was allowed to drive, but the officer conducted the search after she was arrested.

Wait, but the officer could argue that the search was incident to the arrest under the automobile exception. The Supreme Court case Arizona v. Gant (2009) says that a search incident to arrest of a vehicle is allowed if the police officer has a reasonable belief that the vehicle contains evidence that could be destroyed, or if the officer's safety could be at risk. But if the suspect is secured, especially in a squad car, the justification is weaker.

In this case, the driver was secured in the squad car, so the officer's safety isn't an issue. As for evidence destruction, the court usually requires more than just a possibility; it needs to be a real risk. Since the car was already under the officer's control, maybe the exception doesn't apply.

Additionally, the officer didn't have a warrant, so unless there's an exception, the search would be unlawful. The fact that the cocaine was in a jacket on the back seat—so not in plain view—means it couldn't be seized under the plain view doctrine.

Looking at the options, let's go through them:

A: Says search requires warrant unless exigent circumstances. That's correct, but the question is whether exigent circumstances existed here. The officer had arrested the driver, so maybe not.

B: Officer didn't have driver's consent. True, but if another exception applies, like search incident to arrest, this wouldn't matter. So B might not be the correct reason.

C: Denies because of officer safety. But the driver was secured, so officer safety isn't an issue. So C is probably wrong.

D: Reasonable suspicion due to suspended license. Suspended license might not give probable cause to search the vehicle. It just gave probable cause to arrest for driving under suspension.

E: Probable cause because of suspended license. Again, the suspended license relates to the arrest, but not necessarily to the right to search the vehicle. The suspended license gives probable cause to arrest, but not necessarily to search without a warrant.

F: Deny because it's a valid search incident to arrest. This is the key point. Under Gant, a search incident to arrest is allowed if the officer has a reasonable belief that evidence might be destroyed. But if the driver is secured, maybe this doesn't apply. However, some jurisdictions might still allow it if they think the car could be moved or evidence could be accessed.

G: Grants suppression because she was secured, so no expectation of finding evidence. This seems correct because if the suspect is secured, the risk of evidence destruction is low, and the police can't just search the car on general grounds.

H: Grants because it's a personal item not in plain sight. That's another point—jacket not in plain sight, so plain view exception doesn't apply. But whether the search itself was legal is the main issue.

I: Deny because no privacy in car. The Supreme Court has ruled that cars have a lower expectation of privacy, but the initial search still requires a warrant or exception. So even if there's a lower expectation, the lack of warrant or exception might still make it unlawful.

J: Grants because no warrant for the jacket. But the issue is whether the search of the entire car requires a warrant. The jacket being in the back seat might not change that.

So, the main question is whether the search incident to arrest applies when the suspect is secured. Under Gant, the search incident to arrest is allowed if the officer has a reasonable belief that evidence might be found. But if the suspect is in custody and the car is under control, the exception might not apply.

In this case, the officer had probable cause to arrest because of the suspended license. But after securing her, searching the car without a warrant would require another exception. If the officer didn't have a warrant and no other exception applies, the search was illegal.

So, the motion should be granted because the officer didn't have a warrant and no exception applies because the suspect was secured. That would point towards option G: "Yes, it must be suppressed because she was secured in the squad car and the police could not expect to find evidence relating to the current arrest in the car."

Wait, but another angle: the search incident to arrest. The Supreme Court in Gant allows a search incident to arrest if the officer has a reasonable belief that the vehicle contains evidence relevant to the offense of arrest. Here, the arrest was for driving under suspension. If the officer had a reasonable belief that the car might contain evidence of that offense (like the suspended license), then the search would be allowed. But the officer found cocaine, which is unrelated. However, the question is whether the search itself was legal, not whether the evidence is admissible.

Wait, no. The issue is whether the search was legal. So, if the search incident to arrest applies, the search is legal even if they find evidence of another crime. But under Gant, the search is allowed only if the officer has a reasonable belief that the vehicle contains evidence of the offense. Here, the officer might have thought the car could contain evidence of driving under suspension, like the suspended license itself, but that's already found. Alternatively, maybe the officer had a reasonable belief that the car could contain evidence of other crimes, but that's not necessarily clear.

Alternatively, perhaps the officer didn't have a reasonable belief that the car contained evidence of the current offense, so the search wasn't justified under Gant.

In this case, the officer searched the car after arresting her, but without a warrant. If the only exception would be if the officer had a reasonable belief that evidence of the arrest offense was present, but if the driver's license was already in evidence, perhaps that's not enough. So, the search wasn't justified, making the evidence inadmissible.

So, the suppression motion should be granted because the officer didn't have a warrant and no exception applies. Therefore, the correct answer is G: "Yes, it must be suppressed because she was secured in the squad car and the police could not expect to find evidence relating to the current arrest in the car."

The suppression motion is likely to be granted because the officer did not have a warrant and there were no exceptional circumstances justifying the search. The driver was secured in the squad car, reducing the need for a search incident to arrest, and the cocaine was found in a jacket not in plain sight.
