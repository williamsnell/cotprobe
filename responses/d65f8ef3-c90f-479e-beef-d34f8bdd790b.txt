Okay, so I've got this math problem here. Let's see what it's asking. The question is: When n equals 11, what is the value of 10 minus (n plus 6)? The options are from A to J, with various numbers listed.

Alright, first, I need to substitute the value of n into the equation. Since n is 11, I'll replace n with 11 in the expression. So the expression becomes 10 minus (11 plus 6). 

Wait, let me make sure I'm reading that right. It's 10 minus the quantity of n plus 6. So the order of operations would mean I should handle what's inside the parentheses first before subtracting from 10.

So, n is 11, so 11 plus 6. Let me add those together. 11 plus 6 is 17. Got that part down. Now, the expression simplifies to 10 minus 17.

Hmm, okay, 10 minus 17. That's like starting at 10 and moving 17 steps back on the number line. So 10 minus 10 is 0, and then I have 7 more to subtract, which would take me to -7. So 10 minus 17 equals -7.

Let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Sometimes I get mixed up with the signs. So, 11 plus 6 is definitely 17. Then 10 minus 17, yes, that's -7. 

Looking back at the options, I need to find which letter corresponds to -7. Scanning through the options: A is 3, B is 0, C is 5, D is -7, E is -5, and so on. So the correct answer should be option D: -7.

I think that's it. No, wait, did I add correctly? 11 plus 6 is 17, right? 11 plus 5 is 16, plus another 1 is 17. Yep, that's correct. Then 10 minus 17 is indeed -7. So I'm confident that D is the right choice.

The value is calculated by substituting n = 11 into the expression: 10 - (11 + 6) = 10 - 17 = -7. The correct answer is D.

Answer: D
