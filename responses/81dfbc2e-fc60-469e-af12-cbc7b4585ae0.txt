Okay, so I have this question about a psychotherapist, Dr. Ryan, who used to be sexually involved with a man several years ago. Now he's calling her to start therapy, but he's married and his problems aren't related to their past. The question is asking what Dr. Ryan should do.

Hmm, I remember that in psychology, there are strict ethical guidelines about therapists treating former lovers or people they've had relationships with. I think this is called a dual relationship, and it's generally discouraged because it can create boundary issues and affect the therapist's objectivity.

So, the options are A through J. Let me go through them one by one.

Option A says she should see him but tell a supervisor or colleague. That might be about transparency, but I think the main issue is whether it's appropriate to take him on as a patient at all. Disclosing to a supervisor might help her manage, but it doesn't necessarily solve the ethical problem of treating someone she's had a relationship with.

Option B is denying the request without reason. That seems harsh. Maybe she can't just unilaterally deny without giving any reason. It might be better to explain why she can't take him on.

Option C suggests seeing him only if more than two years have passed and she's sure it won't affect her objectivity. I recall that sometimes a time frame is considered, like two years, but it's not the only factor. She also needs to assess her ability to remain unbiased.

Option D says she can see him if she feels she can maintain boundaries. But relying on her own feelings might not be enough. She needs a more objective assessment, perhaps through supervision or policy.

Option E is referring to a colleague. That seems like a safer option because it avoids any potential conflict of interest. But maybe she feels she's the best fit for him, so she might not want to refer.

Option F is continuing therapy but avoiding discussing the past. But that's tricky because the past relationship could influence her therapeutic approach, even if not discussed. It's better to address it upfront.

Option G suggests she see him only if she determines it won't interfere with her objectivity. This seems similar to option C but without the two-year timeframe. Maybe the key is her own assessment, but I'm not sure if that's sufficient.

Option H is offering therapy over the phone or online. That maintains physical boundaries but still allows for the therapeutic relationship, which might not solve the underlying issue of dual relationships.

Option I requires his wife's consent. That's a bit odd because the wife isn't the client, and the issue is more about the therapist's objectivity than the wife's knowledge.

Option J says to see him but discuss potential conflicts before starting. This seems proactive. She should inform the client about the past relationship and discuss whether it's a problem, giving the client an informed choice.

So, considering all options, the best approach is probably to not take him on as a client because of the dual relationship. But if she decides to proceed, she needs to discuss the potential conflicts. Alternatively, referring to another therapist might be the safest bet.

Wait, but the question is what she "should" do. Ethical guidelines usually advise against treating former lovers. So perhaps the best answer is to refer him to a colleague, which is option E. But I'm not entirely sure because some therapists might have a policy where, after a certain time, it's acceptable if they can maintain boundaries.

Alternatively, option J suggests discussing the potential conflicts, which is part of informed consent. But even if she does that, treating him could still be problematic.

I think the most appropriate answer is E: refer the man to a colleague. This avoids any dual relationship issues and ensures he gets appropriate help without compromising her professional integrity.

The correct answer is **E: refer the man to a colleague.** This approach avoids the ethical complications of a dual relationship and ensures the man receives appropriate care while maintaining professional integrity.

Answer: E
