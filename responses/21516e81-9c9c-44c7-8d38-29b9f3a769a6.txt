Okay, so I've got this biology question here, and I need to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. The question is about an organism that doesn't change its metabolic rate much when exposed to wild temperature fluctuations. I need to pick the right term from the options provided.

Hmm, I remember that there are different terms for how organisms handle their body temperatures. Let me think. There's endotherms and ectotherms, right? Endotherms generate their own body heat, like mammals and birds, and they maintain a constant body temperature. Ectotherms, on the other hand, rely on their environment for heat. Their body temperature changes with the environment, so their metabolic rate would fluctuate more as the temperature changes.

Wait, but the question says the organism shows very little change in metabolic rate despite temperature fluctuations. So if the environment is changing a lot, but their metabolism doesn't change, that suggests they don't rely on the environment for body temperature. So maybe they're endotherms, like mammals. But wait, let me make sure.

Looking at the options, homeotherms are a type of endotherm. They maintain a stable internal temperature. So if the environment fluctuates, their metabolism might adjust to maintain that stable temp. But the question says the metabolic rate doesn't change much, implying they don't rely on external temperatures. So homeotherm or endotherm?

Wait, another option is eurytherm. I think that's an organism whose temperature varies widely with the environment. So if they're eurythermic, their metabolism would change a lot with temp changes. So the opposite of that.

Wait, but the question is about little change in metabolic rate. So perhaps the organism has a stable metabolism regardless of temperature. That sounds like a homeotherm, which is a kind of endotherm. So homeotherm would be H.

But wait, another term I'm a bit fuzzy on is poikilotherm. I think that's another word for ectotherm, meaning their internal temperature varies. So their metabolic rate would change a lot because it's tied to the environment.

Wait, but wait, the question says the metabolic rate doesn't change much. So maybe the organism is a homeotherm, which maintains a constant internal temperature regardless of the environment. So their metabolism doesn't vary much because they're regulating it internally.

Alternatively, maybe it's a stenotherm, which I think refers to organisms that can only survive in a narrow range of temperatures. But that's about the range they can handle, not directly about metabolic rate fluctuations.

Wait, another term: heterotherm. I think that's for animals that can switch between endothermic and ectothermic, like some birds or mammals that can enter torpor. So their metabolic rate might drop when they're in torpor, but that's a different scenario.

Wait, the question says the organism shows very little change in metabolic rate. So if they're ectothermic, their metabolic rate would change a lot with temp. So the opposite is true here.

So, if the organism doesn't change much, maybe it's a homeotherm, which is a type of endotherm. So the answer would be H.

Wait, but let me check the options again. The options are A to J. H is homeotherm, yes. But another possibility is eurytherm, but that's about varying with the environment. So that's not it.

Wait, another angle: metabolic rate in endotherms is more stable because they generate their own heat. So when the environment fluctuates, their metabolic rate doesn't change much because they're regulating internally. So the correct answer is H: homeotherm.

Wait, but wait, another term is 'eurytherm' for animals that can tolerate a wide range of temperatures. No, that's about the range they can handle, not the metabolic rate stability.

So I think the correct answer is H: homeotherm.

The organism in question maintains a stable metabolic rate despite temperature fluctuations, indicating it regulates its body temperature internally. Homeotherms, a type of endotherm, maintain a constant internal temperature, making their metabolic rate less affected by external changes. Therefore, the correct answer is:

H
