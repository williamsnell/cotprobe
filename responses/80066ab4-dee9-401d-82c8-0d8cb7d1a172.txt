The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

An avowed corrimunist was elected vice president of a union. A senator, in his investigation of communist infiltration of national labor unions, found a provision in a statute passed by Congress, which makes it a crime for a member of the communist party to act as an official of a labor union. After a subsequent legislative hearing, the communist is dismissed from his position by the union. Which of the following most accurately summarizes the applicable rule of constitutional law regarding the aforementioned provision of the statute?

Options:

A: The statutory provision is a violation of the person's Eighth Amendment right against cruel and unusual punishment.
B: The statutory provision is a violation of the person's Sixth Amendment right to a fair trial.
C: The statutory provision in the act is a form of legislative punishment violative of the Constitution as a bill of attainder.
D: Making it a crime for a Communist to hold a union office is a suspect classification, which violates the equal protection clause.
E: The statutory prohibition is a reasonable method of discrimination since the benefit to the public outweighs the injury or restrictions that would be inflicted upon the person.
F: The statute is valid as it is a reasonable restriction on the First Amendment rights of an individual in the interest of national security.
G: The statutory provision is unconstitutional as it violates the person's right to due process under the Fifth Amendment.
H: The statutory provision is a form of unconstitutional prior restraint on a person's First Amendment right of free association.
I: The statutory prohibition is a valid exercise of Congress' power to regulate interstate commerce.
J: The statute is unconstitutional because it infringes upon the individual's right to political affiliation, protected under the First Amendment.

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about constitutional law, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let me read the question carefully and break it down step by step.

The question is about a statute passed by Congress that makes it a crime for a Communist Party member to act as an official of a labor union. An avowed communist was elected as vice president but was later dismissed after a senator's investigation. The issue is about what constitutional rule applies to this statute.

First, I remember that the Constitution has several amendments that deal with rights and government actions, so I need to recall relevant cases or principles.

The options are from A to J, each citing different constitutional amendments. Let me go through each possible option.

Option A says it's a violation of the Eighth Amendment against cruel and unusual punishment. That doesn't seem right because the statute is about making Communist Party members ineligible for union offices, not about punishment severity. So A is probably not correct.

Option B mentions the Sixth Amendment right to a fair trial. The statute doesn't directly relate to criminal procedure or trials, so B doesn't fit here.

Option C states it's a legislative punishment and a bill of attainder. I remember that bills of attainder are laws that target a specific person or group without a trial, effectively punishing them. The Supreme Court has struck down such laws because they violate separation of powers; only the judiciary can impose punishment. This statute makes it a crime for Communists to hold union positions, which sounds like a legislative punishment targeting a specific group. So C seems plausible.

Option D talks about a suspect classification under the equal protection clause. The statute treats Communists differently, but I'm not sure if it's a suspect classification. Suspect classifications usually involve race, religion, or national origin. Communists as a group might not be a suspect class, so D could be incorrect.

Option E suggests the prohibition is reasonable discrimination for public benefit. While the government can have interests in national security, the way the statute is written might be too broad. But I'm not sure if this is the correct analysis here.

Option F says it's a valid restriction on First Amendment rights for national security. The First Amendment protects association, so making it a crime for being a Communist official could infringe on that. However, the Supreme Court has sometimes upheld such laws if they meet certain tests, like in cases involving subversion. But I'm not sure if this is the right approach because the question is about whether it's a bill of attainder.

Option G mentions due process under the Fifth Amendment. The statute doesn't seem to deny due process; it's a criminal prohibition, so if someone violates it, they can be prosecuted. But the issue here is more about the nature of the law itself, not due process procedures. So G might not be the best fit.

Option H talks about prior restraint on free association. Prior restraint usually refers to restricting speech or activities before they happen, which is a First Amendment issue. But the statute here is a criminal prohibition, not a prior restraint. So H might not be correct.

Option I says it's a valid exercise of Congress's interstate commerce power. I don't see a direct link to interstate commerce here; the statute is about union officials and political affiliation, not economic activities across state lines. So I is probably not the right answer.

Option J claims it infringes on the right to political affiliation under the First Amendment. The Supreme Court has recognized political affiliation as a form of expression protected by the First Amendment. If the statute penalizes being a Communist in a union role, that could infringe on that right. But I think the more direct issue is whether it's a bill of attainder, so J might be a contender.

Now, I need to choose between C and J. Let's think about the key issue. The statute is making it a crime for Communists to hold union positions. This could be seen as a bill of attainder because it's singling out a specific group without a trial, effectively imposing criminal liability. The bill of attainder clause in Article I prohibits Congress from passing such laws. 

Alternatively, J is about the First Amendment right to political affiliation. The Communist Party is a political group, and affiliating with them is a form of speech. The Supreme Court has ruled that laws which penalize political affiliation can be problematic. For example, in cases like Gravel v. United States, the court struck down laws that required disclosure of Communist affiliations, but that's a different context.

But in this question, the statute is creating a criminal offense for holding a union position if you're a Communist. That seems more akin to a bill of attainder because it's a legislative act targeting a specific group without a judicial trial. The bill of attainder doctrine focuses on whether the law is imposing punishment without the process of law.

So, the correct answer is likely C. It's a legislative punishment and a bill of attainder, which is unconstitutional because only the judiciary can impose punishment.

The question revolves around a statute that criminalizes Communist Party members from holding union offices, challenging its constitutionality. The key issue is whether this statute violates any constitutional provisions. 

Upon analysis, the statute appears to target a specific group (Communists) without a judicial trial, which aligns with the concept of a bill of attainder. The bill of attainder clause in Article I prohibits Congress from enacting such laws, as it involves legislative punishment without due process. While the First Amendment right to political affiliation (Option J) is relevant, the primary issue here is the unconstitutional nature of the statute as a legislative punishment. 

Thus, the most accurate answer is:

C: The statutory provision in the act is a form of legislative punishment violative of the Constitution as a bill of attainder.

Answer: C
