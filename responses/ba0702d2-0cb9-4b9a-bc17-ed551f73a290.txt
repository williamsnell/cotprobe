Okay, so I have this Python question here: what is the output of 4*1**4? Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my operator precedence, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, I remember that in Python, the order of operations, or precedence, is important. The operators have different levels, and I think exponentiation comes before multiplication. Let me confirm that. Oh right, exponentiation (**) is higher precedence than multiplication (*), so that's the first thing that happens.

So the expression is 4 * 1 ** 4. Breaking it down: first evaluate 1 ** 4. Wait, 1 to the power of 4 is just 1, right? Because 1 times itself any number of times is still 1. So 1**4 equals 1.

Now the expression simplifies to 4 * 1. Multiplying those together gives 4 * 1 = 4. So the result should be 4.

Looking at the options, H is 4. So the answer should be H.

The expression 4*1**4 evaluates to 4 because exponentiation is done before multiplication. 1**4 is 1, then 4*1 is 4.

Answer: H
