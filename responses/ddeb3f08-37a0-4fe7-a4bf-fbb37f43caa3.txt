Okay, so I have this genetics question here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question says that on average, 46% of the loci in a species' gene pool are heterozygous. I need to find the average homozygosity of the species. Hmm, I remember that heterozygosity and homozygosity are related but opposite terms.

Wait, what's homozygosity again? Oh right, homozygosity refers to the proportion of loci that are homozygous. And since each locus can either be homozygous or heterozygous (assuming we're talking about diploid organisms and only two alleles), the sum of heterozygosity and homozygosity should equal 100%, right?

So if 46% are heterozygous, then the remaining percentage must be homozygous. Let me do the math. 100% minus 46% equals 54%. So the average homozygosity should be 54%. Looking at the options, option A is 54%, so that should be the answer.

Wait, but wait a second. Did I miss anything? Sometimes these questions can be tricky. Oh, wait, the question mentions the average homozygosity, so yes, it's just the percentage of loci that are homozygous. Since each locus is either heterozygous or homozygous, adding up to 100%, so 54% makes sense.
</think>

The average homozygosity is calculated by subtracting the heterozygosity percentage from 100%. Since 46% of loci are heterozygous, the remaining 54% are homozygous.
