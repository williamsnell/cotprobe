Okay, let's try to solve this problem. So, Mr. Kohlberg has a flower shop, right? He starts the day with 152 roses. Then he sells 96 of them. After that, he wants to split the remaining roses equally among 8 vases. We need to find out how many roses will be in each vase.

Hmm, first, I think I should figure out how many roses are left after he sells 96. So, he started with 152 and sold 96. That means I subtract 96 from 152. Let me write that down: 152 minus 96. 

Wait, what's 152 minus 96? Let me do the math. 150 minus 90 is 60, and then 2 minus 6 is negative 4, so maybe I should do it more carefully. Alternatively, 152 minus 96. Let me think: 96 plus 56 is 152, because 96 plus 50 is 146, and then plus 6 is 152. So, 96 plus 56 is 152, which means 152 minus 96 is 56. So, he has 56 roses left after selling.

Now, he wants to separate these 56 roses equally into 8 vases. So, I need to divide 56 by 8 to find out how many roses go into each vase. Let's see, 8 times 7 is 56. So, 56 divided by 8 is 7. Therefore, each vase will have 7 roses.

Wait, let me double-check. He had 152, sold 96, so 152 - 96 = 56. Then, 56 divided by 8 is 7. Yeah, that seems right. So, each vase will have 7 roses.

Looking at the options, H is 7. So the answer should be H.
