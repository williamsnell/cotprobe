Okay, so I have this problem here about pairs of numbers in a set of 20 positive integers. The question is asking for the minimum number of pairs that have a difference which is a multiple of 10. The options are from A to J, and I need to figure out which one is correct.

Hmm, let me think about this. I remember something about the pigeonhole principle being useful in problems where you have to find guaranteed pairs or groupings. The pigeonhole principle says that if you have more pigeons than holes, at least one hole must contain more than one pigeon. Maybe that applies here.

So, the problem is about the differences between numbers being multiples of 10. A difference being a multiple of 10 means that two numbers are congruent modulo 10, right? Because if two numbers have the same remainder when divided by 10, their difference will be a multiple of 10. For example, 12 and 22 both leave a remainder of 2 when divided by 10, so 22 -12 =10, which is a multiple of 10.

So, there are 10 possible remainders when you divide a number by 10, which are 0 through 9. These are the "pigeonholes." Each number in the set of 20 will fall into one of these 10 categories based on their remainder modulo 10. The "pigeons" here are the 20 numbers.

Now, if I distribute 20 numbers into 10 categories, the pigeonhole principle says that at least one category must contain at least two numbers. But wait, we're looking for pairs, so maybe more than that. Let me think.

Actually, the problem is asking for the minimum number of such pairs. So, to minimize the number of pairs, we'd want to distribute the numbers as evenly as possible across the 10 categories. Because if the numbers are spread out, fewer pairs would be formed within each category.

If we have 20 numbers and 10 categories, the most even distribution would be 2 numbers in each category. Because 20 divided by 10 is exactly 2. So each category has exactly 2 numbers.

Now, in each category, the number of pairs is the combination of 2 numbers taken from that category. The formula for combinations is C(n,2) = n(n-1)/2. So for each category with 2 numbers, C(2,2) is 1 pair. Since there are 10 categories, the total number of pairs would be 10 * 1 = 10 pairs.

Wait, but the question is about differences that are multiples of 10. So each of these pairs within the same category would indeed have a difference that's a multiple of 10. Therefore, the minimum number of such pairs is 10.

Looking back at the options, option B is 10. So that should be the answer.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Suppose instead that one category has more than two numbers. For example, if one category has 3 numbers, then the number of pairs in that category would be C(3,2)=3. That would increase the total number of pairs beyond 10. So to minimize the total, we want as few categories as possible to have more than 2 numbers. But in our case, with 20 numbers, each category can have exactly 2, so no category has more than 2, leading to exactly 10 pairs.

Yes, that makes sense. So the minimum number of pairs is 10, which is option B.

The problem involves finding the minimum number of pairs in a set of 20 positive integers where the difference between the pairs is a multiple of 10. Using the pigeonhole principle, each number can be categorized by its remainder when divided by 10, resulting in 10 possible categories (0 through 9). Distributing 20 numbers evenly across these 10 categories gives 2 numbers per category. Each category contributes one pair, leading to a total of 10 pairs. Thus, the minimum number of such pairs is 10.

Answer: B
