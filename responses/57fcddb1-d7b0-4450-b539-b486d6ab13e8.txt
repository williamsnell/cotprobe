Okay, so I have this logarithm problem to solve. The question is asking me to find the value of b such that log base b of 343 equals -3/2. Hmm, logarithms can be tricky, but I remember some basic properties that might help here.

First, I recall that log_b(a) = c means that b raised to the power of c equals a. So in this case, since log_b(343) = -3/2, that should mean that b^(-3/2) equals 343. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, noâ€”actually, if log_b(343) is -3/2, then b raised to the power of -3/2 equals 343. Let me write that down to make it clearer.

So, mathematically, that would be:
b^(-3/2) = 343.

Hmm, solving for b. I think I can rewrite this equation to make it easier. Since the exponent is negative, I can take the reciprocal of both sides. So, 1/(b^(3/2)) = 343. Alternatively, I can write b^(3/2) = 1/343. Wait, no, that's not correct because taking the reciprocal of both sides would flip the fraction. Let me double-check that.

Wait, if I have b^(-3/2) = 343, then taking reciprocals on both sides gives me 1/(b^(3/2)) = 343. So, that would mean b^(3/2) = 1/343. Hmm, but 343 is a number I recognize. I think 343 is 7^3 because 7*7 is 49, and 49*7 is 343. Yes, 7^3 is 343, so 343 is 7^3. So, 1/343 would be (1/7)^3, which is 7^(-3).

So, now I have b^(3/2) = 7^(-3). To solve for b, I can raise both sides of the equation to the power of 2/3 to get rid of the exponent on the left side. So, (b^(3/2))^(2/3) equals b. On the right side, (7^(-3))^(2/3) would be 7^(-3 * 2/3) which simplifies to 7^(-2), because 3*(2/3) is 2. So that's 1/(7^2) which is 1/49.

Wait, so that means b equals 1/49. Let me check that again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, if b is 1/49, then log base (1/49) of 343 should be -3/2. Let me compute that.

Alternatively, using the definition, (1/49)^(-3/2) should equal 343. Let's compute (1/49)^(-3/2). A negative exponent means taking the reciprocal, so it's the same as (49)^(3/2). Then, 49 is 7^2, so (7^2)^(3/2) equals 7^(2*(3/2)) which is 7^3, which is 343. Yes, that checks out.

Wait, but another way to look at it is, since 343 is 7^3, and I'm dealing with exponents, maybe I can represent 343 as 7^3 and see if that helps. So, from the equation b^(-3/2) = 343, which is 7^3, so then b^(-3/2) = 7^3.

Taking both sides to the power of (-2/3) would give me b = (7^3)^(-2/3). Let's compute that. 3 times (-2/3) is -2, so 7^(-2) is 1/49. So, same result, b = 1/49.

Looking back at the options, option B is 1/49, and option H is -1/49. Since the base of a logarithm must be positive and not equal to 1, I think 1/49 is a valid base. So, the correct answer should be B.

Wait a second, let me just make sure I didn't mix up any steps. So, the original equation is log_b(343) = -3/2. So, b^(-3/2) = 343. Then, 343 is 7^3, so b^(-3/2) = 7^3. So, taking both sides to the power of -2/3 gives b = (7^3)^(-2/3) = 7^(-2) = 1/49. Yep, that's correct.

I think I've got it right. So, the answer is B: 1/49.

The value of \( b \) is \( \frac{1}{49} \), which corresponds to option B.

Answer: B
