Question:

Berkowitz (1971) revised the original frustration-aggression hypothesis by proposing that frustration leads to aggression when:

Options:

A: the target of the aggression is of lower-status than the aggressor.
B: the aggressor is experiencing high levels of stress.
C: there are aggressive cues in the environment.
D: acting aggressively is likely to produce desirable outcomes.
E: the target of the aggression has shown previous signs of weakness.
F: the aggressor feels threatened or endangered.

Okay, so I have this question about Berkowitz's revision of the frustration-aggression hypothesis. I remember that the original hypothesis was that frustration always leads to aggression. But Berkowitz must have changed that, right? I think he added some conditions or moderating factors.

The question is asking what condition Berkowitz proposed that makes frustration lead to aggression. The options are A through J. Let me go through each one.

Option A: Target is of lower status. Hmm, I think lower status might make someone a more likely target, but I'm not sure if that's what Berkowitz focused on. He might have looked at other factors.

Option B: High stress levels. Stress could influence behavior, but I'm not certain if that's the key point Berkowitz made. He might have been more about the presence of certain cues or situations.

Option C: Aggressive cues in the environment. Oh, wait, I think Berkowitz said that frustration doesn't always lead to aggression unless there are cues that suggest aggression is appropriate. Like, if you see a weapon, you're more likely to act aggressively when frustrated. So this could be it.

Option D: Acting aggressively leads to good outcomes. That sounds more like reinforcement or operant conditioning. Berkowitz's theory is more about situational factors, so maybe this isn't it.

Option E: Target shown weakness. That might make the target an easier target, but I don't recall Berkowitz focusing on the target's characteristics like that.

Option F: Aggressor feels threatened. That sounds more like self-defense than frustration leading to aggression. Berkowitz's focus was more on the environment and cues.

Option G: Blame on external factors. If you can blame others, maybe you're less likely to feel guilty, but I'm not sure how that ties into frustration leading to aggression.

Option H: Rewarded for aggression. That's about learning, perhaps operant conditioning again. Berkowitz's revision is about when frustration leads to aggression, not about past reinforcement.

Option I: Lack of social support. Social support can influence behavior, but I'm not sure it's the key factor Berkowitz identified.

Option J: Internal locus of control. That's about believing you control your outcomes. Not sure how that directly ties to frustration and aggression in this context.

Wait, I think Berkowitz's main point was that frustration leads to aggression only if certain conditions are met, like the presence of aggressive cues. So, when the environment has cues that make aggression seem justified or appropriate, then frustration will lead to aggression. So the answer should be C: there are aggressive cues in the environment.

The correct answer is C: there are aggressive cues in the environment. Berkowitz revised the frustration-aggression hypothesis to include the presence of environmental cues that suggest aggression is appropriate, such as the presence of weapons, which can influence individuals to act aggressively when frustrated.

Answer: C
