Question:

One evening, a defendant set fire to a homeowner's occupied house. As a result of the blaze, the homeowner's daughter was killed. The defendant was charged with felony murder on the first count and arson on the second count of the two-count indictment. The jury found the defendant guilty on the first count, but returned a not guilty verdict on the second. The defendant's attorney's motion to set aside the guilty verdict on the felony murder charge will most likely be

Options:

A: granted, because the defendant's right to a fair trial was violated by the inconsistent verdicts.
B: denied, because the jury's decision is final and cannot be overturned.
C: denied, because the defendant's proper remedy is to seek an appellate review for a non-constitutional error.
D: denied, because the verdicts do not amount to a reversible error.
E: granted, because the guilty verdict is plain error that adversely affects the defendant's constitutional rights.
F: granted, because the verdicts contradict each other, raising reasonable doubt.
G: granted, because the verdicts are legally inconsistent and should lead to an acquittal of both charges.
H: denied, because the jury found sufficient evidence to convict on the first count, regardless of the second count outcome.
I: granted, because the defendant was not directly responsible for the death.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the answer to this multiple-choice question about felony murder and arson charges. Let me break it down step by step.

The scenario is that a defendant was charged with felony murder on the first count and arson on the second. The jury convicted him of felony murder but acquitted him of arson. Now, his attorney is moving to set aside the felony murder conviction. The question is about whether this motion will be granted or denied and why.

First, I need to understand the charges. Felony murder typically refers to a situation where a death occurs during the commission of a felony. In this case, the felony is arson. So if the defendant was convicted of felony murder, that's because the death of the homeowner's daughter happened during the arson.

But wait, the jury acquitted him of arson. That's interesting because if the arson wasn't proven, can the felony murder still stand? Because felony murder usually requires that the underlying felony (here, arson) was committed. If the jury found him not guilty of arson, does that affect the felony murder charge?

I remember that in some jurisdictions, a conviction for felony murder can stand even if the underlying felony isn't proven, but I'm not sure. Or maybe it's the other way aroundâ€”without the felony, the felony murder charge can't hold. But wait, in this case, the jury convicted him of felony murder but acquitted him of arson. So the question is whether the conviction for felony murder can be sustained without a conviction on the underlying felony.

I think there's a legal principle called "constructive arson" or something similar, where if the intent to commit arson is proven, even if the fire wasn't actually set, but that doesn't seem to apply here. Or maybe it's about whether the felony murder requires the felony to be an inherently dangerous one, which arson is.

Wait, another angle: felony murder is a form of murder based on the commission of a felony. So if the felony isn't proven, can the felony murder still be sustained? Or does the felony have to be proven?

I think in some states, felony murder requires that the felony is a separate, underlying crime. So if the jury found the defendant not guilty of arson, which is the felony, then the felony murder charge might be in jeopardy. Because without the felony, the felony murder charge can't stand.

But I'm not entirely sure. I remember that in some cases, the felony murder can be based on an attempt to commit the felony. Like, if someone dies during the commission of an attempted felony, it can still be felony murder. But in this case, the jury acquitted on the arson count, so maybe that affects it.

Wait, but the arson charge could be acquitted because the fire was accidental, or maybe the defendant didn't have the intent. But if the jury convicted on felony murder, they must have found that the defendant committed the felony (arson) and that the death occurred as a result.

But if the jury acquitted on arson, does that mean they didn't find that the defendant committed the arson? That could create a conflict. Because for felony murder, the felony must be established. So if the jury found him guilty of felony murder but not guilty of arson, that's inconsistent because the felony murder requires the felony.

So the defense attorney is arguing that the verdicts are inconsistent. So the question is whether the court would grant the motion to set aside the guilty verdict because of these inconsistent verdicts.

Looking at the options, A says granted because the right to a fair trial was violated by inconsistent verdicts. F says granted because the verdicts contradict each other, raising reasonable doubt. G says granted because the verdicts are legally inconsistent and should lead to acquittal of both charges.

H says denied because the jury found sufficient evidence on the first count regardless of the second. So H is arguing that the felony murder can stand on its own, even if arson doesn't.

I think the key here is whether the jury's inconsistent verdicts can be used to overturn the felony murder conviction. If the jury acquitted on arson, which is the underlying felony, then felony murder can't stand because it's based on that felony.

But wait, in some jurisdictions, the felony murder charge doesn't require the felony to be a separate conviction. Or maybe the felony murder is based on the intent to commit arson, regardless of whether the arson itself is proven.

Alternatively, maybe the jury's inconsistent verdicts are not a legal basis to overturn the conviction. Because juries can sometimes return inconsistent verdicts, and that's not grounds for setting aside a verdict unless it's against the weight of the evidence or there's a legal inconsistency that's so clear-cut.

I think the issue here is whether the verdicts are "legally inconsistent." If the jury found the defendant guilty of felony murder but not guilty of arson, is that a legal inconsistency? Because felony murder requires the commission of a felony, which in this case is arson. So if the jury didn't find him guilty of arson, does that mean they didn't find that he committed the felony necessary for felony murder?

In some cases, if the same factual act underlies both charges, a jury can't convict on one and acquit on the other if they're mutually exclusive. But here, the charges are related but not the same. Felony murder is a separate charge based on the commission of a felony.

Wait, but the felony murder charge is in the first count, and the arson is in the second. So the jury convicted on the felony murder but acquitted on the arson. That could be problematic because the felony murder requires the felony to have been committed. So if the felony wasn't proven, the felony murder can't stand.

Alternatively, maybe the felony murder can be based on a lesser-included offense. Like, if the defendant intended to commit arson but only succeeded in setting fire to the house, but the jury acquitted on the arson count. Hmm, not sure.

I think the better argument is that the verdicts are inconsistent because to find guilty of felony murder, the jury must have found that the defendant committed arson. If they acquitted on arson, that could mean they didn't find that element, which is necessary for felony murder.

So, the defense attorney would argue that the verdicts are legally inconsistent and that the felony murder conviction can't stand. Therefore, the motion to set aside should be granted.

Looking at the options, G says granted because the verdicts are legally inconsistent and should lead to acquittal of both charges. But wait, the defendant was acquitted on the second count, so why would the first count be acquitted too? Maybe because the inconsistency is so fundamental that the felony murder can't stand without the underlying felony.

Alternatively, option F says granted because the verdicts contradict each other, raising reasonable doubt. That's more about reasonable doubt, which is a higher standard. Option A is about fair trial rights being violated by inconsistent verdicts, but I'm not sure if inconsistent verdicts alone violate the fair trial right.

Option H says denied because the jury found sufficient evidence on the first count regardless of the second. But if the second count is necessary for the first, then H might not be correct.

So I'm leaning towards the idea that the verdicts are legally inconsistent, and thus the felony murder conviction should be set aside. So the answer would be G or F or A.

Wait, but another thought: the felony murder charge doesn't require the defendant to be convicted of the underlying felony. It just requires that the felony occurred, which the jury must have found to convict on felony murder. But if the jury acquitted on the arson, that suggests they didn't find that the defendant committed the felony, which would mean the felony murder can't stand.

So the verdicts are inconsistent because the jury convicted on a charge that requires the felony but acquitted on the felony itself. Therefore, the verdicts are legally inconsistent, and the felony murder conviction must be set aside.

So the answer would be G: granted because the verdicts are legally inconsistent and should lead to an acquittal of both charges.

Wait, but does it lead to acquittal of both? The defendant was acquitted on the second count already. The first count is the felony murder, which would now be set aside as well. So G seems correct.

But I'm not 100% sure. Another possibility is that the jury's verdicts are allowed to be inconsistent, and it's up to the jury's discretion. So the court shouldn't overturn it just because the verdicts are inconsistent. In that case, the motion would be denied.

But I think when the verdicts are legally inconsistent, meaning that one verdict cannot stand with the other, the court must set them aside. For example, if a jury convicts someone of a greater included offense but acquits on the lesser, that's inconsistent and the greater offense conviction must be set aside.

In this case, felony murder is based on the commission of arson. So if the jury acquitted of arson, the felony murder can't stand. Therefore, the court should grant the motion and set aside the felony murder conviction.

So the correct answer is G: granted because the verdicts are legally inconsistent and should lead to an acquittal of both charges.

The defendant was charged with felony murder and arson. The jury convicted him of felony murder but acquitted him of arson. Felony murder requires the commission of an underlying felony, which in this case is arson. Since the jury acquitted the defendant of arson, they likely did not find that the underlying felony was committed. This creates a legal inconsistency because felony murder cannot stand without the underlying felony. Therefore, the verdicts are legally inconsistent, and the felony murder conviction must be set aside.

Answer: G
