Question:

A team of engineers constructing signal lights for airplanes that they can use to guide them to runways are attempting to determine the brightness needed for the pilot to be able to detect the tower at 1 mile away. They set the light to a test brightness and establish communication with an inbound pilot. When the pilot is 1 mile away from the tower, he says he cannot see the light. In terms of Signal Detection Theory, what would this be called?

Options:

A: True negative
B: False positive
C: Incorrect rejection
D: Correct hit
E: False alarm
F: Hit
G: False negative
H: Miss
I: True positive
J: Correct rejection

Okay, so I have this question about signal detection theory, and I need to figure it out. Let me start by understanding the scenario.

So, there's a team of engineers working on airplane signal lights. They're trying to determine the right brightness for the pilot to detect the tower from 1 mile away. They set the light to a test brightness and communicate with an inbound pilot. When the pilot is exactly 1 mile away, he says he can't see the light. 

Hmm, I remember that signal detection theory deals with how observers make decisions about stimuli. It's often applied in psychology and engineering. The main concepts are hits, misses, false alarms, and correct rejections. 

Let me think about the terms. A hit occurs when the signal is present, and the observer correctly identifies it. A miss is when the signal is present, but the observer fails to detect it. A false alarm is when the observer thinks the signal is present when it's actually absent. And a correct rejection is when the signal isn't present, and the observer correctly says it's not there.

In this case, the engineers sent a signal (the light) at 1 mile, which is the target distance. The pilot is supposed to detect it, but he says he can't see it. So the signal was present, but the pilot didn't detect it. That sounds like a miss because the signal was there (present), but the response was incorrectâ€”it was missed.

Wait, let me make sure. The pilot was at 1 mile, and the light was set to the test brightness. The pilot couldn't see it. So the engineers intended for the light to be detectable at that distance, but it wasn't. So from the detection theory standpoint, the signal (light) was present, but the observer (pilot) failed to detect it. That's a miss.

Looking at the options, H is miss. So the answer should be H.

The scenario involves a pilot failing to detect a signal light when it should have been visible. According to signal detection theory, this is classified as a "miss" because the signal was present, but it was not detected.

Answer: H
