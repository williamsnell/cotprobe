Question:

The frequency of the gene for sickle-cell anemia in African-Americans is less than that found in the people living in their ancestral home in Africa. What factors might account for this difference?

Options:

A: Sickle-cell disease is more deadly in America
B: Sickle-cell disease has been completely eradicated in America
C: The sickle-cell gene mutates at a lower rate in America
D: Genetic drift has led to a decrease in the frequency of the sickle-cell gene in African-Americans
E: Increased medical intervention in America allows individuals with sickle-cell disease to live longer and reproduce more
F: There is no difference in the frequency of the sickle-cell gene between African-Americans and their African ancestors
G: In America, the incidence of malaria is insignificant, sickle-cell genes are being diluted by normal genes and interracial marriages.
H: There is a higher survival rate for sickle-cell carriers in America
I: Sickle-cell allele is more dominant in Africa
J: The sickle-cell allele is being actively selected against in the African-American population

Okay, so I have this question about the frequency of the sickle-cell anemia gene in African-Americans compared to their African ancestors. Hmm, I remember that sickle-cell is a genetic disorder where the red blood cells become misshapen, causing various health issues. But I also recall that in regions where malaria is common, having the sickle-cell trait can actually be beneficial because it confers some resistance to the disease. 

So the question is why the frequency of this gene is lower in African-Americans than in their ancestral home in Africa. Let me think about the possible factors. The options are from A to J. 

Option A says that sickle-cell disease is more deadly in America. I'm not sure about this because I think the disease itself is more about the genetic condition, not necessarily the environment's deadliness. Maybe, but I'm not certain. 

Option B claims the disease has been completely eradicated in America. No, that can't be right. Sickle-cell is still present, just not as prevalent as in some other regions. So B is probably incorrect. 

Option C suggests the sickle-cell gene mutates at a lower rate in America. I don't think mutation rates change much based on location. So C might not be the right answer. 

Option D is genetic drift leading to a decrease. Genetic drift is a random change in allele frequencies, especially in smaller populations. African-Americans are a subset of the larger African population, so maybe some genetic drift has occurred, but is that the main reason? I'm not sure yet. 

Option E says increased medical intervention allows individuals with the disease to live longer and reproduce. That could be a possibility because better medical care might mean more people with the disease survive to have children, thus keeping or increasing the gene frequency. But wait, the question states that the frequency is less, so if E is true, the frequency would increase, which contradicts the question. So E is probably not the answer. 

Option F states there's no difference. But the question says the frequency is less, so F is incorrect. 

Option G says that in America, the incidence of malaria is insignificant, so sickle-cell genes are diluted by normal genes and interracial marriages. Malaria is less prevalent in the Americas than in Africa. Without the selective pressure of malaria, the sickle-cell allele, which is usually maintained because it provides resistance, might decrease in frequency. But wait, the sickle-cell allele is recessive, so carriers (heterozygotes) have some resistance. If there's no selection, the allele might start to decrease because in the absence of malaria, the sickle-cell trait is harmful, so natural selection would act against it. Also, interracial marriages could introduce other alleles, reducing the frequency. So G sounds plausible. 

Option H suggests higher survival rates for carriers in America. If carriers (heterozygotes) have higher survival, that would maintain or increase the frequency. But the question says the frequency is lower, so H might not be the right answer. 

Option I says the allele is more dominant in Africa. Dominant alleles don't affect frequency in the same way. Sickle-cell is a recessive trait, so I don't think dominance plays a role in the frequency difference. So I is probably incorrect. 

Option J claims the allele is being actively selected against in African-Americans. If the environment doesn't favor the sickle-cell allele anymore, like without malaria, selection against it could happen. In regions without malaria, the sickle-cell allele is harmful because it causes the disease, so natural selection would favor not having it. That would lead to a decrease in frequency, which aligns with the question. So J is a possible answer. 

Now, I need to decide between G and J. 

G says that without malaria, the genes are diluted. J says the allele is selected against. Both could contribute. But the main reason for the decrease would be selection. In Africa, the sickle-cell allele is maintained because it provides a survival advantage against malaria. In America, where malaria isn't a major issue, the allele is not beneficial and is actually detrimental, so natural selection would act against it, reducing its frequency. That points more towards J. 

Alternatively, G mentions interracial marriages, which could introduce other alleles and reduce the frequency through genetic mixing. But I think the main factor is the change in selective pressure. So J seems more accurate. 

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. If the sickle-cell allele is recessive, then only homozygous individuals (SS) show the disease, while carriers (Ss) have some resistance. If there's no selection, the frequency could decrease because the disease is harmful. So J makes sense. 

So the answer would be J: The sickle-cell allele is being actively selected against in the African-American population.
</think>

The frequency of the sickle-cell anemia gene in African-Americans is lower than in their ancestral African populations due to the change in selective pressures. In Africa, where malaria is prevalent, the sickle-cell allele provides a survival advantage to carriers (heterozygotes), maintaining its frequency. However, in America, where malaria is less common, the sickle-cell allele is not beneficial and is harmful, leading to its decline due to natural selection. 

Answer: J
