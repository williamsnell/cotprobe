Okay, so I need to figure out how many sides a rhombus has. Let me think about what I remember from geometry. I know that a rhombus is a type of quadrilateral, which means it has four sides. But wait, let me make sure I'm not confusing it with something else.

I recall that a quadrilateral is any four-sided polygon. So the basic types include squares, rectangles, parallelograms, and rhombuses. A square is a special case of a rhombus where all angles are right angles. A rectangle is another type where all angles are right, but the sides aren't necessarily equal. A parallelogram has opposite sides equal and parallel, and a rhombus is like a parallelogram but with all sides equal in length.

So, if a rhombus is a quadrilateral, it must have four sides. That would make the answer 4, which is option J. I don't think it's any other number because I remember that all these shapes with four sides are called quadrilaterals, and rhombus is one of them.

Wait, could I be mixing it up with something else? Like, maybe a triangle or a pentagon? No, triangles have three sides, pentagons five. There's also the polygon with eight sides, an octagon, but that's not a rhombus.

I think I'm confident that a rhombus has four sides. So the correct answer should be J: 4.

The rhombus is a quadrilateral, which means it has four sides. Therefore, the correct answer is J.
