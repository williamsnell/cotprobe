Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about translating a sentence into predicate logic. The sentence is "Earth isn't bigger than Jupiter." The options are labeled A through J, each with a different logical expression. I need to figure out which one is the correct translation.

First, I should break down the sentence. The subject is Earth, and the predicate is about not being bigger than Jupiter. The predicate logic given uses Bxy, where x is bigger than y. So I need to represent that Earth isn't bigger than Jupiter.

Let me think about the structure. The original statement is a negative one, so I should expect a negation somewhere. The sentence is saying that Earth (e) is not bigger than Jupiter (j). In predicate logic, that would be represented as ¬B(e, j), right? Because Bxy is x bigger than y, so B(e,j) would mean Earth is bigger than Jupiter. The negation would make it Earth is not bigger than Jupiter.

Looking at the options, I need to find which one corresponds to ¬B(e,j). Let's go through each option:

A: j~Be → This seems like it's trying to say Jupiter is not bigger than Earth? Because ~Be would mean not B with j as the subject? Wait, not sure. Maybe it's j ~B e, but I'm not certain.

B: Be~j → This looks like B with e and ~j, so Earth is bigger than not Jupiter? That doesn't make sense.

C: Bej → B(e,j), which would mean Earth is bigger than Jupiter. But the original statement is the opposite, so this can't be right.

D: ~eBj → This is ~ (e B j), which would mean it's not the case that Earth is bigger than Jupiter. Wait, that's exactly what we want. So D is ¬B(e,j), which matches our desired translation.

E: ~Bej → This is ¬B(e,j), same as D. Wait, both D and E look similar but written differently. Let me check the notation again. Oh, wait, in D it's ~eBj, which might be interpreted as ~(e B j), which is the same as ¬B(e,j). Similarly, E is ~Bej, which is the same as ¬B(e,j). So both D and E seem correct. But maybe the notation differs.

Wait, sometimes the order matters. Let me make sure. The predicate Bxy is x bigger than y. So in D, it's ~eBj. If the notation is ~eBj, that could be read as e is not bigger than j, which is correct. Alternatively, E is ~Bej, which is the negation of B(e,j), so same meaning.

Wait, but looking back, the options might be written differently. Let me check each option again:

A: j~Be → Maybe jB~e? No, probably j ~Be, which is Jupiter not bigger than Earth? That would be correct if the statement was Jupiter isn't bigger than Earth, but the original is Earth isn't bigger than Jupiter.

So A is saying Jupiter isn't bigger than Earth, which is the opposite of what we need. So A is incorrect.

B: Be~j → Earth B not Jupiter? That doesn't make sense. The predicate requires two arguments, so B(e, ~j) isn't valid. So B is wrong.

C: Bej → B(e,j), which is Earth bigger than Jupiter. We need the negation, so C is incorrect.

D: ~eBj → This is ~ (e B j), which is Earth is not bigger than Jupiter. That's exactly what we need.

E: ~Bej → This is ¬B(e,j), same as D. So both D and E seem to be the same. But wait, are they written differently? Let me think about the order. In predicate logic, the order is important. Bxy is x bigger than y. So in D, ~eBj would be ~(e B j), which is the same as ¬B(e,j). Similarly, E is ~Bej, which is ¬B(e,j). So both D and E are correct.

Wait, that can't be. The options shouldn't have two correct answers. Let me check the options again.

Looking back, the options are:

A: j~Be

B: Be~j

C: Bej

D: ~eBj

E: ~Bej

F: e~Bj

G: ~Bje

H: B~ej

I: ~jBe

J: Bje~

Hmm. So D is ~eBj, which is ¬(e B j), which is ¬B(e,j). E is ~Bej, which is ¬B(e,j). So both D and E are same. That suggests a problem in the options, but perhaps I'm misinterpreting the notation.

Alternatively, maybe in the options, the negation is written differently. Let's clarify the notation. In standard predicate logic, the negation applies to the entire predicate. So ~B(e,j) is the correct way to write that B(e,j) is not true.

Looking at the options, D is ~eBj. That could be interpreted as e is not B j, which is the same as ~B(e,j). Similarly, E is ~Bej, which is ~B(e,j). So both D and E are the same.

But that's impossible because each option is unique. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the notation. Maybe in the options, the order matters in how the negation is applied.

Wait, another approach: the statement is Earth isn't bigger than Jupiter. So it's ¬(Earth bigger than Jupiter), which is ¬B(e,j). So looking for ¬B(e,j).

Which options express that?

Option E is ~Bej, which is ¬B(e,j).

Option D is ~eBj, which is ¬(e B j), which is same as ¬B(e,j).

So both D and E are correct. But that can't be, so perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the way the options are written is different. Maybe in D, it's ~eBj, which could be read as e is not B j, which is same as ¬B(e,j). Similarly, E is ~Bej, which is same as ¬B(e,j). So both D and E are correct.

But in the options, both D and E are present. That suggests that perhaps the correct answer is both D and E, but that's unlikely. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the notation.

Wait, perhaps the way the options are written is that the negation is applied differently. For example, ~eBj could be read as e is not B j, which is correct. ~Bej is same as ¬B(e,j). So both D and E are correct, but that's conflicting.

Alternatively, perhaps the options are written with different precedence. Let me think about the standard notation. In predicate logic, the negation applies only to the immediately following term unless parentheses dictate otherwise. So ~eBj would be ~(e B j), which is same as ¬B(e,j). Similarly, ~Bej is ¬B(e,j).

So both D and E are correct. But that can't be because the options are unique. So perhaps I'm making a mistake.

Wait, looking again at the options, perhaps D is ~eBj, which is ¬(e B j), which is ¬B(e,j). E is ~Bej, which is same. So both D and E are correct. But in the options, only one can be correct. Maybe I'm missing something else.

Wait, perhaps the options are written with the subject first. So in D, ~eBj is e is not B j, which is correct. E is ~Bej, which is same. So both are correct, but that's a problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the options are using a different notation where the order of terms matters. Let me think: Bxy is x bigger than y. So in the statement, it's Earth isn't bigger than Jupiter, so e is x, j is y. So the predicate is B(e,j). The negation is ¬B(e,j).

Looking for ¬B(e,j) in the options:

Option E is ~Bej, which is ¬B(e,j).

Option D is ~eBj, which is same as ¬B(e,j).

So both D and E are correct, but that's impossible. Therefore, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the notation in the options.

Wait, perhaps the way the options are written is that the subject comes first, followed by the predicate. So in D, ~eBj would be e is not bigger than j, which is correct. E is ~Bej, which is same.

So both D and E are correct, but that can't be. Therefore, perhaps I need to check the options again.

Looking back, the options are:

D: ~eBj

E: ~Bej

So both are correct. But in the given options, only one can be correct. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is E: ~Bej. Because in the predicate, Bxy is x bigger than y. So to negate that, it's ~Bxy, which would be ~B(e,j). So in the options, that's E: ~Bej.

Alternatively, D is ~eBj, which could be read as e is not B j, which is same as ~B(e,j).

So both D and E are same, but perhaps the way the options are written, E is the correct one.

Wait, perhaps the notation in the options is such that the subject is first, then the predicate. So in E, ~Bej is same as ~B(e,j), which is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is E.

Wait, but in standard predicate logic, the negation applies to the entire predicate. So ~B(e,j) is correct, which is E.

So I think the correct answer is E: ~Bej.

The correct translation of "Earth isn't bigger than Jupiter" into predicate logic is ¬B(e, j), where Bxy means x is bigger than y. This corresponds to option E: ~Bej.

Answer: E
