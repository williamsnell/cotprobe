Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about blood groups determined by codominant alleles. The alleles are L^m and L^n, and the blood groups are M, MN, and N. They've given the numbers of each phenotype in a population of 800 college students. The numbers are M: 392, MN: 336, N:72, which adds up to 800.

The task is to determine the frequency of the L^m and L^n alleles. The options are from A to J, each giving different allele frequencies.

Hmm, I remember that in codominant alleles, both alleles are expressed, so the phenotype depends on which alleles are present. For blood groups, the M and N are determined by these alleles. So, the M phenotype would be when someone has two L^m alleles (homozygous), MN would be heterozygous (L^m and L^n), and N would be when someone has two L^n alleles.

Wait, no, wait. Oh, no, wait. Wait, in the case of the MN blood group, which is actually the ABO system, but maybe this is a different system. Oh, wait, the question says it's the M, MN, and N blood groups determined by two codominant alleles, L^m and L^n. So I think for this problem, the phenotypes are as follows:

- M phenotype: when the genotype is L^m L^m
- MN phenotype: when the genotype is L^m L^n
- N phenotype: when the genotype is L^n L^n

So each person has two alleles, and the phenotype is determined by which alleles they have.

Since these are codominant, both alleles are expressed, so the MN phenotype comes from having one of each allele.

Now, to find the allele frequencies, I think I can use the Hardy-Weinberg principle. The Hardy-Weinberg equation is p² + 2pq + q² = 1, where p is the frequency of one allele, q is the frequency of the other, and p² is the homozygous dominant, 2pq is heterozygous, and q² is homozygous recessive.

Wait, but in this case, the phenotypes correspond to:

- M: L^m L^m → p²
- MN: L^m L^n → 2pq
- N: L^n L^n → q²

So the counts given are the observed numbers of each phenotype. So I can calculate the proportion of each phenotype and set that equal to the terms in the Hardy-Weinberg equation.

Let me get the counts:

Total = 800.

M: 392 → proportion = 392/800 = let's calculate that. 392 divided by 800. 800 divided by 8 is 100, so 392 is 49 x 8, so 49 x 8=392. 392/800 = 0.49.

MN: 336 → 336/800. 336 divided by 800, let's see: 336 ÷ 800 = 0.42.

N:72 → 72/800 = 0.09.

Wait, so according to the problem, the M phenotype is 0.49, MN is 0.42, and N is 0.09.

But wait, wait, that can't be right because the sum is 0.49 + 0.42 + 0.09 = 1. So that adds up correctly.

So according to Hardy-Weinberg, the frequency of M (p²) is 0.49, the MN (2pq) is 0.42, and N (q²) is 0.09.

So we can set up equations:

p² = 0.49 → p = sqrt(0.49) = 0.7.

q² = 0.09 → q = sqrt(0.09) = 0.3.

Wait, but wait a second. Wait, is that correct? Because in the Hardy-Weinberg model, p is the frequency of L^m, and q is the frequency of L^n. So p² would be the frequency of L^m L^m, which is M, and q² would be L^n L^n, which is N.

So the M phenotype is p² = 0.49 → p = 0.7.

The N phenotype is q² = 0.09 → q = 0.3.

But wait, let's check if 2pq is 0.42. Because 2pq would be the heterozygotes.

So p=0.7, q=0.3.

2pq = 2*(0.7)*(0.3) = 2*0.21 = 0.42, which matches the MN phenotype frequency.

So that all adds up correctly.

So the allele frequencies would be p=0.7 for L^m and q=0.3 for L^n.

So looking at the options, option A says 0.65 and 0.35, which doesn't match. Option B is 0.6 and 0.4—no. Option E is 0.75 and 0.25—no. Option G is 0.7 and 0.3—yes, that matches.

Wait, but let me double-check because sometimes it's easy to get confused between p and q.

Wait, the M phenotype is L^m L^m, so p is the frequency of L^m, which is 0.7, and L^n is 0.3.

So the frequency for L^m is 0.7, and for L^n is 0.3.

Looking at the options, option G is 0.7 for L^m and 0.3 for L^n. So that should be the correct answer.

Alternatively, let me make sure I didn't mix up p and q. Because sometimes people get confused about which is dominant or recessive, but in this case, the alleles are codominant, so it's just about which is which.

So the answer should be G.

The problem involves determining the allele frequencies of L^m and L^n in a population of 800 college students based on their blood group phenotypes: M, MN, and N. The phenotypes correspond to the genotypes as follows:

- **M**: L^m L^m (homozygous for L^m)
- **MN**: L^m L^n (heterozygous)
- **N**: L^n L^n (homozygous for L^n)

Using the Hardy-Weinberg principle, the frequencies of the phenotypes are related to the allele frequencies by the equation:

\[
p^2 + 2pq + q^2 = 1
\]

where:
- \(p^2\) is the frequency of the M phenotype (L^m L^m),
- \(2pq\) is the frequency of the MN phenotype (L^m L^n),
- \(q^2\) is the frequency of the N phenotype (L^n L^n).

From the data:
- Frequency of M = \( \frac{392}{800} = 0.49 \),
- Frequency of MN = \( \frac{336}{800} = 0.42 \),
- Frequency of N = \( \frac{72}{800} = 0.09 \).

Using these values:
1. \( p^2 = 0.49 \) → \( p = \sqrt{0.49} = 0.7 \),
2. \( q^2 = 0.09 \) → \( q = \sqrt{0.09} = 0.3 \),
3. \( 2pq = 0.42 \) → \( 2(0.7)(0.3) = 0.42 \), which confirms consistency.

Thus, the allele frequencies are:
- \( p = 0.7 \) for L^m,
- \( q = 0.3 \) for L^n.

The correct answer is **G: 0.7 for L^m and 0.3 for L^n**.
