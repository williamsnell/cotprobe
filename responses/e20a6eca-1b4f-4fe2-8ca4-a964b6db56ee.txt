B: 35.2
C: 36.5
D: 26.4
E: 27.3
F: 31.9
G: 32.2

Answer:
    
<think>
Okay, so I've got this problem here about finding the molecular weight of a gas. Hmm, let me see. The problem states that 4.50 grams of the gas occupies 4.0 liters at 950 torr and 182°C. They give me R as 0.082 L·atm/mol·K. The options are from A to J, so I need to calculate and pick the right one.

First, I remember that the ideal gas law is PV = nRT. I'll probably need that here. But wait, the pressure is given in torr, and R is in atm, so I should convert the pressure to atmospheres. Oh right, 1 atm is 760 torr. So 950 torr divided by 760 gives me the pressure in atm. Let me calculate that: 950 / 760. Let me do that division. Hmm, 760 goes into 950 once, that's 760, subtract, I get 190. Then 190/760 is 0.25. So total is 1.25 atm? Wait, wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, 760 * 1.25 is 950, right? Because 760 * 1 is 760, and 760 * 0.25 is 190, so 760 + 190 = 950. Yes, so pressure P is 1.25 atm.

Next, the temperature is given in Celsius, 182°C. I need to convert that to Kelvin. So add 273.15 to get K. 182 + 273 is 455, plus 0.15 is 455.15 K. Let me just use 455 K for simplicity, since the options are probably rounded.

We have mass m = 4.50 grams. Molecular weight is molar mass, so M. I need to find M. The formula rearranged from ideal gas law to solve for M would involve n, which is moles. Moles = mass / molar mass, so n = m/M. Let me plug that into the ideal gas law.

PV = nRT → PV = (m/M)RT. I can rearrange this to solve for M: M = (mRT)/(PV).

Wait, let me make sure that's right. So, M = (mRT)/(PV). Yeah, because if I multiply both sides by M, I get M PV = m RT. So M = m RT / (P V).

Now, plugging in the numbers:

m = 4.50 g

R = 0.082 L·atm/mol·K

T = 455 K

P = 1.25 atm

V = 4.0 L

So M = (4.50 g * 0.082 * 455) / (1.25 * 4.0)

Let me calculate numerator and denominator step by step.

First numerator: 4.50 * 0.082 = 0.369. Then 0.369 * 455. Let's compute that: 0.369 * 400 is 147.6, 0.369 *55 is about 20.295. So total is 147.6 +20.295=167.895.

Denominator: 1.25 *4.0 =5.0.

So M = 167.895 /5.0 = approx 33.579 g/mol.

Wait, but that's not one of the options. Let me check my calculations again.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the units or the calculation steps. Let me redo the multiplication.

Wait, 4.50 *0.082 is 0.369. Then 0.369 *455.

Wait, 0.369 *455. Let me compute that accurately.

455 *0.3 =136.5

455 *0.06=27.3

455 *0.009=4.095

Adding these together: 136.5 +27.3=163.8, plus 4.095 is 167.895. So that's correct.

Denominator: 1.25 *4=5. So 167.895 /5=33.579.

Hmm, but looking at the options, the closest I have is F:31.9, J:34.7. So 33.579 is between them. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculations. Let me check the numbers again.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the pressure conversion. Let me recheck that. 950 torr divided by 760 torr/atm.

950 /760 = (950 ÷ 76) /10 → Let me compute 950 ÷760.

Divide numerator and denominator by 10: 95/76.

Hmm, 76*1=76, 76*1.2=91.2, 76*1.25=95.

Because 76 *1.25 = 76 + (76/4) =76+19=95. So 95/76=1.25. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the temperature conversion. 182°C is 182 +273.15= 455.15 K. Let me see if using 455.15 affects the result.

So, let me recalculate the numerator with T=455.15.

So 4.50 *0.082 =0.369.

0.369 *455.15 = ?

Let me compute 0.369 *455 =167.895 as before. Now, 0.369 *0.15=0.05535. So total is 167.895 + 0.05535=167.95035.

Denominator: same as before, 5. So M=167.95035 /5=33.59007 g/mol. So approximately 33.59. Hmm, but the options don't have that. Let me look at the options again.

Options are:

A:28.1

B:35.2

C:36.5

D:26.4

E:27.3

F:31.9

G:32.2

H:29.8

I:30.5

J:34.7

Hmm, 33.59 is closest to J:34.7, but that's a bit off. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the formula. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I should have used a different value for R. Oh, wait, R is given as 0.082 L·atm/(mol·K), which I used correctly.

Wait, another approach: perhaps using grams correctly. Let me check the calculation again.

Wait, maybe I should re-calculate the numerator and denominator more accurately.

Numerator: 4.50 * 0.082 * 455.15.

Let me compute 4.50 * 0.082 first. 4 *0.082=0.328, 0.5 *0.082=0.041, so total 0.328+0.041=0.369.

Then 0.369 *455.15.

Let me compute 455.15 *0.369.

Compute 455 *0.3 =136.5.

455 *0.06=27.3.

455 *0.009=4.095.

Now, 0.15 *0.3=0.045, 0.15 *0.06=0.009, 0.15 *0.009=0.00135.

So adding those: 0.045 +0.009=0.054, +0.00135=0.05535.

So adding 136.5 +27.3=163.8, +4.095=167.895, plus 0.05535=167.95035.

Denominator: 1.25 *4.0 =5.0.

So M=167.95035 /5 =33.59007 g/mol.

Wait, perhaps I should check if I used the correct gas constant. R is given as 0.082 L·atm/(mol·K), which is correct for these units.

Alternatively, maybe I should have converted the pressure differently. Wait, let me check: 950 torr is 950/760 atm. 760 torr =1 atm. So 950/760=1.25 atm, as I did before.

Wait, perhaps I should have used 455 K instead of 455.15 K. Let me see what's the difference. If I use 455 K, then:

0.369 *455 = 0.369*(450+5)=0.369*450=166.05, 0.369*5=1.845, total 167.895.

So same as before.

So M=33.59, which isn't an option. Wait, the options are up to 36.5, 34.7, etc. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me think again. The formula I used was M = mRT/(PV). Let me check that.

n = m/M, so PV = nRT → PV = (m/M) RT → M = (mRT)/(PV). Yes, that seems correct.

Wait, maybe R is in different units. In some cases, R is 0.0821, but that's close to 0.082. But perhaps the problem expects me to use 0.0821, but that's negligible.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck all steps.

Wait, could it be that the problem uses 25°C or some other temperature? No, the problem states 182°C.

Alternatively, perhaps I should check if the volume was 4.0 L or 4.00 L, but I think that shouldn't matter.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the multiplication.

Let me compute 4.50 *0.082 *455.

4.50 *0.082 =0.369.

0.369 *455.

Let me compute 455 *0.369.

Breakdown:

455 *0.3 =136.5

455 *0.06=27.3

455 *0.009=4.095

Adding them: 136.5 +27.3=163.8, +4.095=167.895.

So that's correct.

Denominator: 1.25 *4=5.

So 167.895 /5=33.579.

Hmm, so 33.58, which is not exactly any of the options. Let me look again at the options.

Wait, option J is 34.7. That's the closest. But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the pressure in atm. Let me recheck that.

950 torr /760 torr/atm = ?

950 ÷760.

Well, 760 is approximately 7.6e2.

Wait, 950 ÷760 = (950 ÷76) ÷10.

Compute 950 ÷76.

76 *12 =912, because 76*10=760, 76*2=152, 760+152=912.

950-912=38.

So 38/76 =0.5.

So 12.5.

Thus, 950 /760 =12.5 /10=1.25 atm.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should check the formula again. Another approach: n = PV/(RT). Then M = m/n = m/(PV/(RT)) )= mRT/(PV). So yes, correct.

Wait, maybe I'm missing a conversion factor somewhere. Let me think about the units.

P is in atm, V in liters, R is L·atm/(mol·K), T in K. So units should cancel correctly.

M is in g/mol, which is correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to use 22.4 L/mol at STP, but that's only at 0°C and 1 atm. Here, the conditions are different. So that approach won't work.

Alternatively, maybe I should use the combined gas law, but I think the ideal gas law approach is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the number of moles first, then find M.

n = PV/(RT).

P=1.25 atm, V=4.0 L, R=0.082, T=455 K.

So n = (1.25 *4.0) / (0.082 *455).

Compute numerator:1.25 *4=5.

Denominator:0.082 *455= 37.11.

So n =5 /37.11 ≈0.1347 moles.

Then M = mass /n =4.50 g /0.1347 mol ≈33.46 g/mol.

Again, about 33.46, which isn't an option. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I should check the calculation of R*T.

R*T=0.082 *455 ≈37.13.

Then PV=1.25 *4=5.

So M= (4.50 *37.13)/5.

4.50 *37.13 = let's compute that.

4 *37.13=148.52.

0.5 *37.13=18.565.

Total 148.52 +18.565=167.085.

Divide by 5:167.085 /5≈33.417 g/mol.

Same as before, about 33.42.

But the options don't have that. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation of n.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the pressure in mmHg, but no, the given R uses atm.

Wait, maybe the problem uses a different value for R, like 0.0821 instead of 0.082. Let me check that.

0.0821 *455 = ?

0.0821 *400=32.84.

0.0821 *55=4.5155.

Total 32.84 +4.5155=37.3555.

Then n = PV/(R T)= (1.25*4)/(37.3555)=5/37.3555≈0.1338 mol.

M=4.50 /0.1338≈33.64 g/mol.

Still around 33.64. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should check if the temperature was 182 K by mistake, but no, it's 182°C, which is 455 K.

Another thought: perhaps I should use exact values without rounding.

Let me compute everything more precisely.

Compute M = (mRT)/(PV).

m=4.50 g.

R=0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K).

T=455.15 K.

P=1.25 atm.

V=4.0 L.

So M = (4.50 * 0.0821 *455.15) / (1.25 *4.0).

Compute numerator:4.50 *0.0821 =0.36945.

0.36945 *455.15.

Let me compute that accurately.

0.36945 *455.15.

First, 455.15 *0.3=136.545.

455.15 *0.06=27.309.

455.15 *0.009=4.09635.

455.15 *0.00045=0.2048225.

Add them together: 136.545 +27.309=163.854, +4.09635=167.95035, +0.2048225≈168.15517.

Denominator:1.25 *4=5.0.

So M=168.15517 /5=33.631034 g/mol.

Still around 33.63.

Wait, but the options don't have this. Let me check the options again.

The options are:

A: 28.1

B: 35.2

C:36.5

D:26.4

E:27.3

F:31.9

G:32.2

H:29.8

I:30.5

J:34.7

Hmm, 33.63 is close to option J:34.7, but it's a bit off. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup.

Wait, perhaps the gas is at 182°C, which is 655 K? No, wait, no: 182 +273=455, that's correct.

Wait, another thought: Did I use the correct value for R? Oh, wait, no! I just realized, R is given as 0.082 L·atm/(mol·K), but sometimes R is 0.0821, which is a more precise value. Let me try using R=0.0821.

So R=0.0821.

Then numerator:4.50 *0.0821=0.36945.

0.36945 *455.15= as before, 168.15517.

Denominator same:5.0.

So M=33.631 g/mol.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects rounding to one decimal place, so 33.6, which isn't an option.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup. Let me recheck the formula.

Wait, perhaps I should have used n = PV/(RT), then M = m/n.

n = (1.25 *4) / (0.082 *455) =5/(0.082*455).

0.082*455=0.082*400=32.8 +0.082*55=4.51 →32.8+4.51=37.31.

So n=5/37.31≈0.134 mol.

M=4.50 /0.134≈33.6 g/mol.

Same result.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to use 455 K as 455, not 455.15, but that's minor.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial pressure conversion. Let me check again.

950 torr → atm.

Yes, 950/760=1.25. Correct.

Hmm, perhaps the options are wrong, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I miscalculated something.

Wait, let me check the calculation again, perhaps I missed a step.

Wait, 4.50 grams is the mass, correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use 22.4 L/mol at STP, but that's under different conditions. Let me see.

Wait, if I adjust to STP conditions, but that's complicating things.

Alternatively, perhaps I should recompute the pressure in another way, but I think I did that correctly.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to use R as 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K), which is a more precise value.

Wait, using R=0.0821:

M = (4.50 *0.0821 *455) / (1.25 *4.0).

Compute numerator:4.50 *0.0821=0.36945.

0.36945 *455= let's compute:

455 *0.3=136.5

455 *0.06=27.3

455 *0.00945= let's see, 455 *0.009=4.095, 455*0.00045=0.20475. So total 4.095+0.20475=4.29975.

Adding up:136.5 +27.3=163.8, +4.29975=168.09975.

Denominator:1.25*4=5.

So M=168.09975/5=33.61995 g/mol≈33.62.

Still not matching any options. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should try with R=0.08206 L·atm/(mol·K), which is a standard value.

R=0.08206.

n = PV/(RT) = (1.25 *4)/(0.08206 *455) =5/(0.08206*455).

0.08206*455= let's compute.

0.08 *455=36.4.

0.00206 *455≈0.9383.

So total≈36.4 +0.9383=37.3383.

n=5/37.3383≈0.1339 mol.

M=4.50/0.1339≈33.63 g/mol.

Same result again.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects an approximate value, so 33.6 is closest to 34.7 (option J), but that's still a bit off.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup. Let me double-check the formula.

Wait, another approach: using grams to moles, then applying the ideal gas law.

n = mass/M.

So PV = nRT → n = PV/(RT).

Then M = mass /n = mass * RT/(PV).

Same as before.

Wait, perhaps I should check if I used the correct volume. The problem says 4.0 liters, which I used.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to round the answer to one decimal place, but even so, 33.58 would round to 33.6, which isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps I should check if the pressure was 950 mmHg, which is torr, which I did correctly.

Wait, perhaps I should check if the problem uses a different value for R, like 0.08206 L·atm/(mol·K), but that won't make a significant difference.

Alternatively, perhaps I should check if I used the correct temperature in K.

Wait, 182°C is definitely 455 K, not 182 K, which would be a very cold temperature, but that's not the case here.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem expects me to use the molar mass in g/mol and the calculations are correct, but perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the density and then find molar mass.

Density (d) = mass/volume =4.50 g /4.0 L=1.125 g/L.

Then, ideal gas equation: PV = nRT → n=PV/(RT).

Density d = mass/volume = molar mass * pressure / (RT).

So d = (M * P)/(R T).

Rearranged: M = d * R T / P.

So M = (1.125 g/L) * (0.082 L·atm/mol·K) * (455 K) / (1.25 atm).

Compute:

1.125 *0.082 =0.09225.

0.09225 *455 ≈42.05625.

42.05625 /1.25=33.645 g/mol.

Again, same result.

Hmm, I'm getting consistent results around 33.6 g/mol, but none of the options match. The closest is J:34.7, but that's a bit higher. Could I have made a mistake in the calculation?

Wait, let me compute the exact value again.

M = (4.50 *0.082 *455) / (1.25 *4)

Compute numerator:4.50 *0.082 =0.369.

0.369 *455 = let's compute exactly.

455 *0.3 =136.5.

455 *0.06=27.3.

455 *0.009=4.095.

Sum:136.5 +27.3=163.8, +4.095=167.895.

Denominator:1.25 *4=5.

So M=167.895 /5=33.579 g/mol.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses R=0.0821 instead of 0.082, but that would make a small difference.

Let me compute with R=0.0821.

M=(4.50 *0.0821 *455)/(1.25 *4).

Compute numerator:

4.50 *0.0821=0.36945.

0.36945 *455= let's compute:

455 *0.3=136.5.

455 *0.06=27.3.

455 *0.00945=4.30575.

Wait, 0.00945 is 0.009 +0.00045.

455 *0.009=4.095.

455 *0.00045=0.20475.

So 4.095 +0.20475=4.29975.

Adding:136.5 +27.3=163.8, +4.29975=168.09975.

Denominator:5.

M=168.09975 /5=33.61995≈33.62.

Still the same.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to round to the nearest whole number, so 34, but the options don't have that either. Hmm.

Wait, looking back at the options, J is 34.7, which is higher than my calculation. Maybe I made a mistake in the pressure conversion.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the pressure in atm.

950 torr /760 = ?

Let me compute 950 ÷760.

760 goes into 950 once (760), remainder 190.

190 ÷760 =0.25, because 760 *0.25=190.

So 1.25 atm. Correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to use 1 atm=760 mmHg, but I did that.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider that maybe the temperature was supposed to be 182 K, but that would be -91°C, which is unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps I should check the problem statement again.

Wait, the problem says 4.50 g occupies 4.0 L at 950 torr and 182°C. So all the numbers are correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but I think that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the numerator.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 4.50 *0.082 *455 again.

4.50 *0.082=0.369.

0.369 *455.

Let me compute 455 *369= let's see:

455*300=136500.

455*60=27300.

455*9=4095.

Adding:136500+27300=163800 +4095=167,895.

So 455 *369=167,895.

But since it's 0.369 *455, it's 167,895 /1000=167.895.

Yes, same as before.

Divide by 5 (denominator), 167.895/5=33.579.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to use the wrong value for R, like 0.0826 instead of 0.082, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps I should check if the volume was 4.00 L instead of 4.0 L, but that's a minor point.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is 33.58, which is approximately 33.6, but none of the options match.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to use a different value for R, such as 0.0826 L·atm/(mol·K), which is another common value.

Let me try that.

R=0.0826.

M= (4.50 *0.0826 *455) / (1.25 *4).

4.50 *0.0826=0.3717.

0.3717 *455= let's compute.

455 *0.3=136.5.

455 *0.07=31.85.

455 *0.0017≈0.7735.

Adding:136.5 +31.85=168.35 +0.7735≈169.1235.

Denominator:5.

M=169.1235 /5≈33.8247 g/mol.

Still around 33.82, which is closer to 34, but the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to use a different R value, perhaps 8.314 J/(mol·K)? No, because the units are different.

Wait, let me try that approach. R=8.314 J/(mol·K), but then I would need to convert pressure to Pascals and volume to cubic meters.

But that's a lot more work and R is given in L·atm units in the problem, so I think that's not the intended approach.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that I'm making a mistake in the initial formula. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula for density. Density = mass/volume.

Also, density is equal to (PM)/(RT), where P is pressure, M is molar mass.

So, d = (P M)/(R T).

Rearranged, M = (d R T)/P.

Density d=4.50 g /4.0 L=1.125 g/L.

So M=(1.125 g/L *0.082 L·atm/mol·K *455 K)/(1.25 atm).

Compute numerator:1.125 *0.082=0.09225.

0.09225 *455=41.983125.

Denominator:1.25.

So M=41.983125 /1.25=33.5865 g/mol.

Same result again.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look at the options again and see if any of them are close. The closest is J:34.7. But 33.6 is closer to 34 than to 33.5 or 34.7.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation. Let me compute 4.50 *0.082 *455.

4.50 *0.082=0.369.

0.369 *455= let's compute 455 *0.369.

455 *0.3=136.5.

455 *0.06=27.3.

455 *0.009=4.095.

Total:136.5+27.3=163.8+4.095=167.895.

Yes, same as before.

Hmm, I'm not sure why my calculation isn't matching any of the options. Perhaps I should check if the problem expects me to use degrees Celsius instead of Kelvin, but that would be a mistake. Let me see what happens if I use T=182 K.

But 182 K is about -191°C, which is very cold, and not the case here. So that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps I should check if I used the correct value for R. The problem states R=0.082 L·atm/(mol·K), which I used correctly.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to use R=0.0821, but that's what I did earlier.

Wait, perhaps I should check the calculation once more.

Wait, 4.50 *0.082=0.369.

0.369 *455=167.895.

Divide by (1.25 *4)=5.

167.895 /5=33.579.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but I think I must have missed something. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the gas isn't ideal, but that's beyond the scope of the problem.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the pressure was given in mmHg, but that's the same as torr, so no.

Wait, perhaps the volume is 4.00 L, but that's the same as 4.0 L.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to use 22.4 L/mol at STP, but that's not applicable here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the number of moles first, then find M.

n=PV/(RT).

P=1.25 atm, V=4.0 L, R=0.082, T=455 K.

n=(1.25 *4)/(0.082 *455)=5/(37.11)=≈0.1347 mol.

M=4.50 /0.1347=33.46 g/mol.

Same result.

Hmm, I'm confident in my calculation, but perhaps the intended answer is option J:34.7, but that's a bit off. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should check the calculation of 4.50 *0.082 *455.

4.50 *0.082=0.369.

0.369 *455= let me compute it as 455 *0.369.

455 *0.3=136.5.

455 *0.06=27.3.

455 *0.009=4.095.

Adding:136.5 +27.3=163.8 +4.095=167.895.

Yes, same as before.

I think I've done everything correctly, but the answer doesn't match any of the options. Perhaps there's a typo in the options, or I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should try using R=0.08206 L·atm/(mol·K).

M=(4.50 *0.08206 *455)/(1.25 *4).

4.50 *0.08206=0.36927.

0.36927 *455= let's compute:

455 *0.3=136.5.

455 *0.06=27.3.

455 *0.00927=4.22415.

Adding:136.5 +27.3=163.8 +4.22415=168.02415.

Denominator:5.

M=168.02415 /5=33.60483 g/mol.

Still about 33.6, same as before.

Hmm, I'm stuck. I think I must have made a mistake somewhere, but I can't find it. Maybe the correct answer is option J:34.7, but I'm not sure.

To determine the molecular weight of the gas, the ideal gas law \( PV = nRT \) was used. The given data includes:

- Mass of gas: \( m = 4.50 \, \text{g} \)
- Volume: \( V = 4.0 \, \text{L} \)
- Pressure: \( P = 950 \, \text{torr} = 1.25 \, \text{atm} \) (converted using \( 1 \, \text{atm} = 760 \, \text{torr} \))
- Temperature: \( T = 182^\circ \text{C} = 455 \, \text{K} \) (converted using \( T(K) = T(C) + 273.15 \))
- Gas constant: \( R = 0.082 \, \text{L·atm/(mol·K)} \)

The molecular weight \( M \) was calculated using the rearranged formula:

\[
M = \frac{mRT}{PV}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
M = \frac{(4.50)(0.082)(455)}{(1.25)(4.0)}
\]

First, calculate the numerator:

\[
4.50 \times 0.082 = 0.369
\]
\[
0.369 \times 455 = 167.895
\]

Next, calculate the denominator:

\[
1.25 \times 4.0 = 5.0
\]

Now, divide the numerator by the denominator:

\[
M = \frac{167.895}{5.0} = 33.579 \, \text{g/mol}
\]

This result, approximately \( 33.58 \, \text{g/mol} \), does not match any of the provided options exactly. However, the closest option is **J: 34.7**, which is slightly higher than the calculated value. Despite thorough recalculations and checking the setup, the discrepancy remains unexplained. Therefore, the most reasonable choice based on the given options is:

**J: 34.7**

Answer: J
