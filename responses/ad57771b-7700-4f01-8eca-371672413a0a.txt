Okay, let's try to figure out this problem. So, the question is about what happens to the free amount of retained earnings if the reserve for contingencies increases by $10,000. 

First, I need to understand the given information. The statement shows different reserves and retained earnings. Let me break it down:

- Reserved for contingencies: $25,000
- Reserved for plant expansion: $20,000
- Total reserves: $45,000 (which makes sense because 25k + 20k = 45k)
- Free retained earnings: $50,000
- Total retained earnings: $95,000 (so 45k + 50k = 95k)

The question says that the reserve for contingencies increases by $10,000. I think this means that the contingencies reserve goes from $25k to $35k. Because when a reserve increases, the amount set aside for that purpose goes up.

Now, how does this affect the free retained earnings? Well, the total retained earnings remain the same unless new money is added or taken out. So total retained earnings are still $95k. But if the contingencies reserve increases by $10k, that $10k must come from somewhere. Since the free retained earnings are part of the total, if the reserve increases, the free amount must decrease by that same amount.

So, originally, the free retained earnings are $50k. If the contingencies reserve goes up by $10k, the free amount goes down by $10k. That would make the new free retained earnings $50k - $10k = $40k.

Looking at the options, A is $40k, so that should be the answer.

The free retained earnings decrease by $10,000 when the contingencies reserve increases, resulting in $40,000.

Answer: A
