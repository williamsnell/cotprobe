Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the correct translation of the sentence "Marco moves from Italy to Spain" into predicate logic. The options given are A through F, each a combination of letters. The predicate Mxyz is defined as "x moves to y from z." 

First, I need to break down the components. The subject is Marco, so that should be represented as 'm'. The action is moving, which is the predicate M. Then, the source country is Italy, which is 'i', and the destination is Spain, 's'. 

So the structure is Marco (m) moving from Italy (i) to Spain (s). Looking at the predicate Mxyz, it translates to "x moves to y from z." So x is the subject, y is the destination, and z is the source. 

Putting it together: M(m, s, i), which would be M followed by m, s, i. So looking at the options, each option is a string of letters. Let's see:

A: Mism â†’ M i s m? That doesn't fit because the order is x, y, z. So x should be m, y should be s, z should be i. So M m s i, which would be Mmsi.

Looking at the options, option E is Mmsi. So E should be the correct answer.

The correct translation is Mmsi, which corresponds to option E.

Answer: E
