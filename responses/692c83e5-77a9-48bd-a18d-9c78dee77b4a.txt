Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about Ethernets, and I need to figure out which statement is typically false. Let me go through each option one by one.

The question is asking which statement is false. The options are A to D. Let's start by recalling what I know about Ethernets.

First, I remember that Ethernet is a type of local area network (LAN) technology. It's based on the bus topology, where all devices are connected to a single cable. Now, I'll look at each option.

Option A: "Ethernet protocols use a collision-detection method to ensure that messages are transmitted properly." I think this is correct. I remember that in Ethernet, when a device wants to send data, it checks if the channel is free. If it's free, it starts transmitting. If two devices send at the same time, a collision occurs. The collision detection mechanism then stops the transmission, and they wait a random time before trying again. So A is true.

Option B: "Ethernets use circuit switching to send messages." Hmm, I'm not sure about this. I recall that circuit switching is more commonly associated with telephone networks, like how a call is established with a dedicated circuit. On the other hand, Ethernet uses a different approach. I think it's using a contention-based method, where devices share the same channel and have to wait their turn. So maybe circuit switching isn't used here. I'll keep this in mind.

Option C: "Networks connected by Ethernets are limited in length to a few hundred meters." That sounds right. I remember that the maximum length of a coaxial cable in an Ethernet network is around 100 meters. If it's longer, you can't connect directly without a repeater or a hub. So C is true.

Option D: "Ethernets use buses with multiple masters." Yes, that makes sense. In a bus topology, all devices are connected to the same bus, so any device can act as a master, meaning they can initiate data transmission. So D is true.

So putting it all together: A is true, B is questionable, C is true, D is true. The false statement must be B because Ethernets don't use circuit switching. Instead, they use a Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD) protocol, which is a contention-based method, not circuit switching.

The false statement about Ethernets is that they use circuit switching to send messages. Ethernets employ a contention-based method with collision detection instead.

Answer: B
