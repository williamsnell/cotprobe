Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure out how many days Erin will take to drink all the juice she made. Let's see... Erin made 12 pints of juice and she drinks 3 cups each day. Hmm, wait, the units are different—pints and cups. I remember that there's a conversion between pints and cups, but I'm not exactly sure what it is. Let me think.

I recall that 1 pint is equal to 2 cups. Yeah, that's right. So if she has 12 pints, I can convert that to cups to make the units match. So, 12 pints multiplied by 2 cups per pint would be 12 * 2 = 24 cups. Oh, okay, so she has 24 cups of juice in total.

Now, she drinks 3 cups each day. So, to find out how many days it'll take her to drink all 24 cups, I need to divide the total amount by the amount she drinks each day. That would be 24 cups divided by 3 cups per day. Let me calculate that: 24 ÷ 3 = 8. So, it'll take her 8 days.

Wait a second, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the beginning: 12 pints converted to cups is 24 cups. She drinks 3 cups a day. 24 divided by 3 is indeed 8. Yeah, that makes sense. So the answer should be 8 days, which is option H.

Erin made 12 pints of juice, which is equivalent to 24 cups since 1 pint equals 2 cups. She drinks 3 cups each day. Dividing the total cups by the daily consumption: 24 ÷ 3 = 8 days.
