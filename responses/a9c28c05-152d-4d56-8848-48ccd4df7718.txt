G: they were difficult for teachers to understand

Alright, so I've got this question about Bernstein and his thoughts on restricted codes in language affecting pupils at school. Hmm, I remember Bernstein was a sociolinguist, right? He talked about language and social classes, something like that. 

Okay, the question is asking why Bernstein thought restricted codes disadvantaged pupils. Restricted codes are usually simpler and used within close-knit groups, like families or friends. They're not as flexible or precise as elaborated codes. So, in a school setting, which often requires more formal and varied language, using restricted codes might be a problem.

Looking at the options:

A: They prevent communication outside peer groups. Well, restricted codes are indeed used within specific groups, so using them might make it hard to communicate with others outside, like teachers or people from different backgrounds. That seems plausible.

B: Targets for bullying. Maybe, but I'm not sure if Bernstein focused on bullying specifically. He was more about how language affects educational opportunities, I think.

C: Short, simple sentences with small vocab. Restricted codes do use simpler structures, but is that the main issue Bernstein pointed out? Or is it more about the context in which they're used?

D: Discourage creativity and original thought. That sounds more like an effect of not being exposed to a wider range of language, but I'm not certain if that's what Bernstein emphasized.

E: Explicit, context-independent meanings. No, restricted codes often rely on shared context, so this might not be it.

F: Poor performance on standardized tests. Standardized tests usually require more formal language and complex structures. If students use restricted codes, they might struggle with test questions. That makes sense.

G: Difficult for teachers to understand. If the teacher is from a different background and uses elaborated code, maybe they can't understand restricted codes well, leading to misunderstandings. But I think Bernstein's point was more about the students' disadvantage in the educational system.

Wait, Bernstein's theory was that children from working-class backgrounds use restricted codes, which are less likely to be used in schools. So when they use restricted codes, they might not perform as well because the school environment expects elaborated codes. This could affect their test performance (F) or their ability to communicate with teachers (G). 

But the question is about why restricted codes disadvantage pupils. Bernstein argued that the educational system is biased towards elaborated codes, so students using restricted codes might not do well because the tests and teaching are in elaborated form. So F: poor performance on standardized tests could be the answer.

Alternatively, A is about communication outside their peer groups. So if they can't communicate with the broader community, including teachers and other students, that's a problem. But the question is specifically about why restricted codes disadvantage pupils at school. So maybe it's F, because the tests are in the elaborated code, making it hard for them.

But wait, Bernstein's point was that using restricted codes limits their opportunities because the educational system requires more elaborate language. So using restricted codes would make it harder for them to succeed in school, leading to poor test performance. So F seems correct.

Another angle: restricted codes have explicit meanings? No, they rely more on context. So E is probably not it.

So I'm thinking between A and F. But the question is about the disadvantage in school, not just communication. So F seems more relevant.

The question asks why Bernstein thought restricted codes disadvantaged pupils at school. Bernstein focused on how the educational system favors elaborated codes, which are more formal and complex. Restricted codes, used within close-knit groups, are less suited for school environments that require formal language. This mismatch can lead to poor performance on standardized tests, which are designed for elaborated codes. Therefore, the correct answer is:

F
