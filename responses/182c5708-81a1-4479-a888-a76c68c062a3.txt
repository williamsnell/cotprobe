Question:

One of the most frequent findings of studies on human beings with “split brains” is that

Options:

A: The right hemisphere is predominantly concerned with verbal information
B: The right hemisphere is predominantly concerned with numeric information
C: aside from the long-known localization of speech functions, the two hemispheres appear to be essentially equivalent as information processors
D: certain kinds of visuospatial tasks are performed beer by the right hemisphere than by the left
E: The two hemispheres appear to have a competitive relationship in information processing
F: the right hemisphere provides backup for the left in some tasks but excels the left in none
G: The left hemisphere is predominantly concerned with handling the body's motor skills
H: The left hemisphere provides backup for the right in some tasks but excels the right in none
I: The left hemisphere predominantly handles emotional processing
J: Both hemispheres are specialized in processing musical information

Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about split-brain studies. The question asks about one of the most frequent findings in studies on humans with split brains. I remember that split-brain refers to patients who have had their corpus callosum severed, which is the bundle of nerves connecting the two hemispheres of the brain. This procedure is usually done to treat severe epilepsy.

From what I've studied, the right and left hemispheres have different functions. The left hemisphere is typically associated with language and speech, which is why damage there can lead to issues like aphasia. The right hemisphere, on the other hand, is often involved in spatial and visual processing. So, when the two hemispheres are split, each can't communicate as effectively, and their specialized functions become more apparent.

Looking at the options, let's go through them one by one. Option A says the right hemisphere is mainly concerned with verbal info. No, that's the left hemisphere's role. So A is incorrect.

Option B suggests the right is into numeric info. I'm not too sure, but I think numbers might be more on the left, with the right handling more spatial tasks. So B might not be right either.

Option C says aside from speech, the hemispheres are equivalent processors. I've heard that after split-brain surgery, it's clear that each hemisphere has its own strengths, so they aren't equivalent. So C is probably not correct.

Option D states that certain visuospatial tasks are better handled by the right. That makes sense because I remember reading that the right hemisphere is superior in tasks like processing visual information, spatial reasoning, and things that require a sense of direction or coordination. So D sounds plausible.

Option E talks about a competitive relationship. I'm not sure if that's a common finding. It might be more about each hemisphere handling different tasks rather than competing. So E might not be the best choice.

Option F says the right provides backup but doesn't excel. That doesn't fit because I know the right hemisphere does excel in certain areas, like spatial tasks, so F is probably incorrect.

Option G claims the left handles motor skills. Wait, motor skills are more about the cerebellum and motor cortex, but the left hemisphere does handle the right side of the body. However, I think the question is about information processing, not motor skills, so G might not be the right answer.

Option H suggests the left provides backup for the right. I don't recall this being a main finding. It seems more like each hemisphere has its own primary functions rather than one backing up the other.

Option I says the left handles emotional processing. No, emotions are more associated with the right hemisphere, particularly the limbic system, which is on the right. So I is incorrect.

Option J states both are specialized in music. I think music processing is more on the right, but I'm not sure if both are equally specialized. Maybe the left handles some aspects, but I'm not certain.

Putting it all together, the most frequent finding is that the right hemisphere excels in certain visuospatial tasks. So the correct answer should be D.

The correct answer is D: certain kinds of visuospatial tasks are performed better by the right hemisphere than by the left.

Answer: D
