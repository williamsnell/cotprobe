Answer:
    
<think>
Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to find all positive integers n less than 2^250 that satisfy three conditions:

1. n divides 2^n, so n | 2^n
2. (n - 1) divides 2^n - 1, so (n-1) | (2^n - 1)
3. (n - 2) divides 2^n - 2, so (n-2) | (2^n - 2)

And I need to select the correct list from options A to J. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I'll consider each condition separately and then see how they might interact.

Starting with the first condition: n divides 2^n. What integers n satisfy n | 2^n? Well, I know that for n to divide 2^n, n must be a power of 2. Because 2^n is a power of 2, and any divisor must also be a power of 2. So n must be 2^k for some integer k ≥ 1. Wait, but wait, is that always true? Let me think. For example, n=1: 1 divides 2^1=2, yes. n=2: 2 divides 4, yes. n=4: 4 divides 16, yes. n=8: 8 divides 256, yes. So it seems that n has to be a power of 2. But wait, what about n=6? 6 doesn't divide 2^6=64 because 64/6 is not an integer. So yes, n must be a power of 2.

Wait, but wait another moment. Are there any other numbers besides powers of 2 that satisfy n | 2^n? For example, n=1: yes. n=2: yes. n=4, 8, 16, etc., yes. What about n=3? 3 doesn't divide 8, so no. n=5: 5 doesn't divide 32, so no. So n must be a power of 2. So n = 2^k for some integer k ≥ 0 (since n=1 is 2^0).

So that's the first condition. Now, moving to the second condition: (n - 1) divides 2^n - 1. So (n-1) | (2^n - 1). Let me think about what n must be here. Let's say n = 2^k, so n - 1 = 2^k - 1. We need 2^k - 1 to divide 2^{2^k} - 1.

Wait, but 2^{m} - 1 is always divisible by 2^{d} - 1 if d divides m. So, for example, if m = 2^k, then 2^{2^k} -1 can be factored as (2^{2^{k-1}} -1)(2^{2^{k-1}} +1). So, if n-1 = 2^k -1, does 2^k -1 divide 2^{2^k} -1? Well, since 2^k -1 divides 2^{m} -1 when m is a multiple of k. So in this case, does 2^k -1 divide 2^{2^k} -1?

Wait, 2^{2^k} mod (2^k -1) is equal to 2^{(2^k mod (2^k -1))} mod (2^k -1). Since 2^k mod (2^k -1) is 1, so 2^{2^k} mod (2^k -1) is 2^1 mod (2^k -1) = 2. So 2^{2^k} -1 mod (2^k -1) is 2 -1 =1, which is not zero. Hmm, that suggests that 2^k -1 does not divide 2^{2^k} -1. But wait, that can't be right because when I plug in small k values, does that hold?

Let me test with k=1: n=2. Then n-1=1, which divides anything, so yes.

k=2: n=4. Then n-1=3. Does 3 divide 2^4 -1=15? Yes, 15/3=5. So yes.

k=3: n=8. n-1=7. 2^8=256. 256-1=255. Does 7 divide 255? 7*36=252, 255-252=3, so no. Wait, that's a problem. So for k=3, n=8, n-1=7, which does not divide 2^8 -1=255 because 255/7 is 36.428..., which is not an integer. So n=8 doesn't satisfy the second condition. Hmm, that's a problem.

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in the earlier logic. Let me check again. For n=4, which is 2^2, n-1=3. 2^4=16, 16-1=15, which is divisible by 3. So yes.

n=8, 2^3. 2^8=256. 256-1=255, which is 3*5*17. 7 doesn't divide 255, as 255/7 is not integer. So n=8 doesn't satisfy the second condition. So n=8 is out.

Wait, that's a problem because earlier I thought n must be a power of 2, but with the second condition, only some powers of 2 will satisfy it.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier approach. Maybe n is a power of 2, but only certain exponents k will satisfy the second condition. Let me check for k=1,2,3,4, etc.

k=1: n=2, n-1=1. 1 divides anything, so yes.

k=2: n=4, n-1=3. 3 divides 15, yes.

k=3: n=8, n-1=7. 7 doesn't divide 255? Wait, 255 divided by 7 is 36.428... So no.

k=4: n=16, n-1=15. 2^16=65536. 65536 -1=65535. Does 15 divide 65535? Let's see: 65535 /15=4369, which is an integer. So yes, 15 divides 65535.

k=5: n=32, n-1=31. 2^32=4294967296. 4294967296 -1=4294967295. Does 31 divide this? Let's compute 4294967295 ÷31. Let me do the division. 31*138,514,751 = 4,294,967,281. 4294967295 -4294967281=14. So remainder 14, so no. So 31 doesn't divide 2^32 -1.

Wait, that's a problem. So for k=4, n=16 works, but k=5, n=32 doesn't. Hmm. So maybe only certain exponents work. Let's try k=4, n=16: works.

k=5: n=32: doesn't work.

k=6: n=64. n-1=63. Does 63 divide 2^64 -1?

2^64 is a huge number. Let me think about 2^64 mod 63. Since 63=7*9, and 2^6=64≡1 mod 63. So 2^6 ≡1 mod 63. So 2^64 = (2^6)^10 * 2^4 = 1^10 * 16 =16 mod 63. So 2^64 -1 ≡15 mod 63. So 63 does not divide 2^64 -1 because the remainder is 15. So n=64 doesn't work.

Wait, but wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check 2^64 mod 63.

Alternatively, since 2^6 ≡1 mod 63, then 2^6k ≡1^k =1 mod 63. So 2^64 = 2^(6*10 +4) = (2^6)^10 *2^4 ≡1^10 *16 ≡16 mod 63. So 2^64 -1 ≡15 mod 63, which is not zero. So 63 doesn't divide 2^64 -1. So n=64 doesn't work.

Hmm, so for k=4, n=16 works. Let's check k=6: n=64, which doesn't work. So maybe only k=1,2,4 work? Let me check k=3: n=8 didn't work, as 7 didn't divide 255. So perhaps the exponents k where n=2^k satisfies the second condition are k=1,2,4.

Wait, but wait, let's check k=0: n=1. Then n-1=0, but division by zero is undefined, so n=1 is a special case. Let me see if n=1 is allowed. The problem says positive integers n < 2^250, so n=1 is allowed. Let's check the conditions for n=1.

n=1: 1 divides 2^1=2, yes. n-1=0: but 0 can't divide anything, so the second condition (n-1 divides 2^n -1) would be 0 divides 1, which is undefined. So perhaps n=1 is excluded? Wait, but the problem says "simultaneously satisfy all three conditions." So n=1 would have n-1=0, which can't divide anything, so n=1 is excluded. So the possible n's are n=2,4,16,... but wait, when k=4, n=16, n-1=15, which does divide 2^16-1=65535. 65535 ÷15=4369, which is integer. So yes, n=16 works.

But wait, earlier I thought n=32 didn't work because 31 didn't divide 2^32-1. Let me confirm that. 2^32 is 4294967296. So 4294967296 -1=4294967295. Dividing by 31: 31*138514751=4294967281, and 4294967295 -4294967281=14, so remainder 14. So yes, 31 doesn't divide 2^32-1. So n=32 doesn't work.

So maybe the exponents k where n=2^k satisfy the second condition are k=1 (n=2), k=2 (n=4), k=4 (n=16). Let me check k=8: n=256. n-1=255. Does 255 divide 2^256 -1?

Well, 255=3*5*17. Let's check if 3,5,17 each divide 2^256 -1.

For 3: 2 mod 3=2. 2^2=4≡1 mod3. So 2^256=(2^2)^128≡1^128=1 mod3. So 2^256 -1≡0 mod3.

Similarly for 5: 2^4=16≡1 mod5. So 2^256=(2^4)^64≡1^64=1 mod5. So 2^256 -1≡0 mod5.

For 17: 2^4=16≡-1 mod17. So 2^8≡1 mod17. So 2^256=(2^8)^32≡1^32=1 mod17. So 2^256 -1≡0 mod17.

Thus, 255 divides 2^256 -1. So n=256 would satisfy the second condition. So k=8 (n=256) works.

Wait, that's interesting. So perhaps for exponents k that are powers of 2, meaning k=2^m, then n=2^{2^m} satisfies the second condition? Let's see.

Wait, for k=1, which is 2^0, n=2^1=2, which works. k=2=2^1, n=4, works. k=4=2^2, n=16, works. k=8=2^3, n=256, works. So yes, perhaps when k itself is a power of 2, then n=2^(2^m) satisfies the second condition.

Wait, let me test k=16: n=65536. n-1=65535=5*13107, let's see if 5 divides 2^65536 -1. 2^4=16≡1 mod5, so 2^65536=(2^4)^16384≡1^16384=1 mod5. So 2^65536 -1≡0 mod5. Similarly, 65535 is 3*5*... etc., but perhaps it's better to check if 65535 divides 2^65536 -1. But that's a big number, but given the pattern, it's likely. So perhaps n=2^(2^m) are the numbers that satisfy both the first and second conditions.

Now, moving on to the third condition: (n-2) divides 2^n -2. So (n-2) | (2^n -2).

Let's consider n being a power of 2, as per the first condition. So n=2^k.

So n-2=2^k -2. We need 2^k -2 to divide 2^{2^k} -2.

Let me think about this. Let's consider small k values:

k=1: n=2. Then n-2=0. Division by zero is undefined, so n=2 is out.

k=2: n=4. n-2=2. Does 2 divide 2^4 -2=16-2=14? Yes, 14/2=7. So yes.

k=4: n=16. n-2=14. Does 14 divide 2^16 -2=65536-2=65534? Let's see: 65534 ÷14=4681. So yes, 14*4681=65534. So yes.

k=8: n=256. n-2=254. Does 254 divide 2^256 -2? Hmm, that's a big number, but let's see.

254=2*127. So we can check if both 2 and 127 divide 2^256 -2.

2 divides 2^256 -2 because it's even. Now, 127 is a prime number. Let's check if 127 divides 2^256 -2.

We can use Fermat's little theorem. Since 127 is prime, 2^126 ≡1 mod127. So 2^126m ≡1^m=1 mod127. So 256=2*128=2*(126+2)=2*126 +4. So 2^256=2^(2*126 +4)= (2^126)^2 *2^4 ≡1^2 *16=16 mod127. So 2^256 -2 ≡16 -2=14 mod127. Since 14≠0 mod127, 127 does not divide 2^256 -2, so 254 doesn't divide 2^256 -2. Therefore, n=256 doesn't satisfy the third condition.

Hmm, that's a problem. So n=256 works for the first two conditions but not the third. So perhaps only certain exponents k where n=2^k satisfy all three conditions.

Wait, let's go back to the third condition. For n=4, k=2, n-2=2, which divides 14. For n=16, k=4, n-2=14, which divides 65534. Let me check n=256 again. As above, 254 doesn't divide 2^256 -2 because 127 doesn't divide it. So n=256 is out.

What about n=65536, which is 2^16. Let's see if it satisfies the third condition. n-2=65534. We need 65534 to divide 2^65536 -2. Let me factor 65534: it's 2*32767. 32767 is 7*3 prime? Wait, 32767 ÷7=4681, which is prime. So 65534=2*7*4681. Let's check if each factor divides 2^65536 -2.

First, 2 divides it because it's even. Now, 7: 2^3=8≡1 mod7, so 2^65536= (2^3)^21845 *2^1 ≡1^21845 *2=2 mod7. So 2^65536 -2 ≡0 mod7, so 7 divides it.

Now, 4681: I'm not sure if 4681 is prime, but let's assume it's prime for a moment. Then, using Fermat's little theorem, 2^{4680} ≡1 mod4681. So 65536 =4680*14 + 65536-4680*14= let me compute 4680*14=65520. So 65536-65520=16. So 2^65536=2^{4680*14 +16}= (2^{4680})^14 *2^16 ≡1^14 *2^16 mod4681.

Now, 2^16=65536. Let's compute 65536 mod4681. 4681*14=65534. 65536-65534=2. So 2^16 ≡2 mod4681. So 2^65536 ≡2 mod4681. Therefore, 2^65536 -2 ≡0 mod4681. So 4681 divides it.

Therefore, 65534=2*7*4681 divides 2^65536 -2. So n=65536 would satisfy the third condition. Wait, but earlier I thought n=256 didn't satisfy the third condition because 254 didn't divide 2^256 -2. So n=65536 might be a candidate.

Wait, but let's check n=65536 against all three conditions.

First condition: n=65536 divides 2^65536. Yes, because 65536 is a power of 2, and 2^65536 is a multiple of it.

Second condition: n-1=65535 divides 2^65536 -1. Let me check. 65535=2^16 -1= (2^8 -1)(2^8 +1)=255*257. Now, 255=3*5*17, and 257 is prime.

We can check if 65535 divides 2^65536 -1. Since 65535=3*5*17*257, we can check each prime factor.

For 3: 2^2 ≡1 mod3, so 2^65536= (2^2)^32768 ≡1^32768=1 mod3. So 2^65536 -1≡0 mod3.

Similarly, for 5: 2^4≡1 mod5, so 2^65536= (2^4)^16384 ≡1^16384=1 mod5. So 2^65536 -1≡0 mod5.

For 17: 2^4=16≡-1 mod17, so 2^8≡1 mod17. So 2^65536= (2^8)^8192 ≡1^8192=1 mod17. So 2^65536 -1≡0 mod17.

For 257: it's a prime. 257 is a Fermat prime: 257=2^8 +1. So 2^8 ≡-1 mod257. So 2^16 ≡1 mod257. Therefore, 2^65536= (2^16)^4096 ≡1^4096=1 mod257. So 2^65536 -1≡0 mod257.

Therefore, 65535 divides 2^65536 -1. So n=65536 satisfies the second condition.

Third condition: n-2=65534 divides 2^65536 -2. As above, 65534=2*7*4681. We saw that 2 divides it, 7 divides it, and 4681 divides it. So yes, 65534 divides 2^65536 -2. So n=65536 satisfies all three conditions.

Wait, but earlier when I tried n=256, it didn't satisfy the third condition because 254 didn't divide 2^256 -2. So perhaps only certain exponents k, where k is a power of 2, and n=2^k, and perhaps k is a multiple of certain numbers, would satisfy all three conditions.

Wait, let's try to summarize the findings so far:

- n must be a power of 2: n=2^k.

- For the second condition to hold, k must be such that 2^k -1 divides 2^{2^k} -1. From our earlier tests, this holds when k itself is a power of 2, i.e., k=2^m for some m. So n=2^{2^m}.

- Now, for the third condition, (n-2) divides 2^n -2. Let's see for n=2^{2^m}.

For m=0: n=2^{1}=2. But n-2=0, which is invalid. So n=2 is out.

m=1: n=4. n-2=2. 2 divides 14, yes. So n=4 works.

m=2: n=16. n-2=14. 14 divides 65534, yes. So n=16 works.

m=3: n=256. n-2=254. 254 doesn't divide 2^256 -2, as we saw earlier. So n=256 is out.

m=4: n=65536. n-2=65534, which divides 2^65536 -2, as we saw. So n=65536 works.

Wait, but earlier I thought n=256 didn't work, but n=65536 works. So perhaps for m even or some pattern.

Wait, let me try to see if there's a pattern in the exponents m where n=2^{2^m} satisfies all three conditions.

Wait, for m=1: n=4 works.

m=2: n=16 works.

m=3: n=256 doesn't work.

m=4: n=65536 works.

Hmm, perhaps the pattern is that m must be a power of 2 as well? Or maybe every m except when m=3, but that seems inconsistent.

Alternatively, perhaps only m=1,2,4,8,... work, but I'm not sure. Let me check m=3 again.

n=256: n-2=254=2*127. Now, 127 is a prime. Let's check if 127 divides 2^256 -2.

Using Fermat's little theorem, since 127 is prime, 2^126 ≡1 mod127. So 256=2*128=2*(126+2)=2*126 +4. So 2^256=2^(2*126 +4)= (2^126)^2 *2^4 ≡1^2 * 16=16 mod127. So 2^256 -2 ≡16-2=14 mod127. Since 14≠0, 127 doesn't divide it, so 254 doesn't divide 2^256 -2. Therefore, n=256 doesn't work.

But for n=65536, which is 2^{16}, let's see m=4. So 16 is 2^4. Wait, no, m is 4 because n=2^{2^4}=2^16=65536.

Wait, perhaps the exponents m where m is a power of 2, i.e., m=2^p, then n=2^{2^{2^p}} would satisfy all three conditions. Let me think.

Wait, but for m=3, n=2^8=256, which didn't work. So perhaps only certain m's work. Alternatively, maybe only when m is 1, 2, or 4.

Wait, perhaps the only solutions are n=4, 16, and 65536. Let me check if n=65536 is less than 2^250. 2^250 is a very large number, much larger than 65536, which is 2^16, so yes, n=65536 is less than 2^250.

Wait, but let me check if n=2^{2^m} for m=1,2,4 works.

m=0: n=2^1=2. But n-2=0, so invalid.

m=1: n=4. Works.

m=2: n=16. Works.

m=3: n=256. Doesn't work.

m=4: n=65536. Works.

m=5: n=2^32. Let me check if n=4294967296 (which is 2^32) would satisfy the third condition. n-2=4294967294. Let's factor this: 4294967294=2*2147483647. Now, 2147483647 is a prime (it's 2^31 -1, known as a Mersenne prime). So we need to check if 2147483647 divides 2^{4294967296} -2.

Using Fermat's little theorem, since 2147483647 is prime, 2^{2147483646} ≡1 mod2147483647. Now, 4294967296=2^32= (2^31)*2. Let me see: 4294967296=2^32= (2^31)*2= (2147483647 -1)*2. So 2^32=2*(2147483647 -1)=2*2147483646. So 2^32=2*2147483646=4294967292. Wait, no, that's not correct. 2^32=4294967296, which is 2 more than 4294967294, which is 2*2147483647.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute 2^32 mod2147483647.

Since 2^31=2147483648≡1 mod2147483647. So 2^32=2^31*2≡1*2=2 mod2147483647. So 2^32 ≡2 mod2147483647. Therefore, 2^4294967296=2^{2^32}= a huge exponent. Let me see, 2^32=4294967296. So 2^{4294967296} mod2147483647.

We can write 4294967296=2^32. So 2^{2^32} mod (2^31 -1). Since 2^{31}≡1 mod(2^31-1), then 2^{31k}≡1^k=1 mod(2^31-1). Now, 2^32=2^{31}*2≡1*2=2 mod(2^31-1). So 2^{2^32}=2^2=4 mod(2^31-1). Therefore, 2^{4294967296} -2 ≡4 -2=2 mod(2^31-1). So 2^{4294967296} -2 ≡2 mod2147483647, which is not zero. Therefore, 2147483647 does not divide 2^{4294967296} -2, so 4294967294 doesn't divide 2^{4294967296} -2. Thus, n=4294967296 doesn't satisfy the third condition.

So, so far, the only n's that satisfy all three conditions are n=4, 16, and 65536.

Wait, but let's check n=65536 again. n=65536 is 2^16. Let me make sure all three conditions are met.

1. 65536 divides 2^65536: yes, because 65536 is a power of 2, and 2^65536 is a multiple of it.

2. 65535 divides 2^65536 -1: As checked earlier, yes.

3. 65534 divides 2^65536 -2: As checked earlier, yes.

So n=65536 works.

Now, let's check if there are higher n's that satisfy all three conditions. For example, n=2^32=4294967296, but as we saw earlier, it doesn't satisfy the third condition. So perhaps the only solutions are n=4,16,65536.

Wait, but looking at the options provided:

Option A: [1,4,16384]

Option F: [4,16,65536]

Option J: [8,32,131072]

Wait, n=4,16,65536 are all in option F. Let me check if 65536 is indeed less than 2^250. 2^250 is a very large number, way bigger than 65536, which is 2^16, so yes.

Wait, but let me check if there are any other n's beyond these. For example, n=2^64. Let me see if it satisfies all conditions.

n=2^64: 18446744073709551616.

Check condition 2: n-1=2^64 -1. Does it divide 2^{2^64} -1? Well, 2^64 -1 is a Mersenne number, and 2^{2^64} -1 can be factored as (2^{2^63} -1)(2^{2^63} +1). Since 2^64 -1 divides 2^{2^64} -1 because 2^64 is a multiple of 64, so yes, 2^64 -1 divides 2^{2^64} -1.

Condition 3: n-2=2^64 -2. Does this divide 2^{2^64} -2? Let's factor 2^64 -2=2*(2^63 -1). Now, 2^63 -1 is a Mersenne number, which is prime (I think it's known as M63, but I'm not sure if it's prime). Let's assume it's prime for a moment. Then, to check if it divides 2^{2^64} -2, we can use Fermat's little theorem.

If 2^63 -1 is prime, then 2^{2^63 -2} ≡1 mod(2^63 -1). So 2^{2^64} =2^{(2^63 -2)*k + r}, but this might get complicated. Alternatively, since n=2^64, n-2=2^64 -2=2*(2^63 -1). So 2^63 -1 must divide 2^{2^64} -2.

But 2^{2^64} mod (2^63 -1): Let's compute the exponent modulo (2^63 -1). Since 2^63 ≡1 mod(2^63 -1), then 2^{63}≡1, so 2^{64}=2^{63}*2≡1*2=2 mod(2^63 -1). Therefore, 2^{2^64}=2^{(2^63)}= (2^{63})^{2^{64-63}}} = (2^{63})^{2} ≡1^2=1 mod(2^63 -1). So 2^{2^64} ≡1 mod(2^63 -1). Therefore, 2^{2^64} -2 ≡1 -2= -1 mod(2^63 -1). So 2^{2^64} -2 ≡-1 mod(2^63 -1), which means it's not divisible by 2^63 -1. Therefore, 2^64 -2 doesn't divide 2^{2^64} -2, so n=2^64 doesn't satisfy the third condition.

So, it seems that beyond n=65536, the next candidate n=2^16=65536 works, but n=2^32 doesn't, n=2^64 doesn't, etc. So perhaps the only solutions are n=4,16,65536.

Now, looking back at the options given:

Option F: [4,16,65536]

Yes, that matches.

Wait, but let me check if there are any other possible n's less than 2^250 that I might have missed. Are there any other exponents k where n=2^k satisfies all three conditions?

From our earlier analysis, it seems that only when k is a power of 2, and for m=1,2,4, which correspond to k=2,4,16, etc., but only up to n=65536 works. Because when k=8 (n=256), it didn't work, and k=16 (n=65536) worked, but k=32 (n=4294967296) didn't. So perhaps the only solutions are n=4,16,65536.

Therefore, the correct list is [4,16,65536], which is option F.
</think>

The problem requires finding all positive integers \( n < 2^{250} \) that satisfy three conditions:

1. \( n \) divides \( 2^n \).
2. \( n-1 \) divides \( 2^n - 1 \).
3. \( n-2 \) divides \( 2^n - 2 \).

### Analysis:

1. **Condition 1**: \( n \) must be a power of 2, as only powers of 2 divide \( 2^n \).

2. **Condition 2**: For \( n = 2^k \), \( n-1 = 2^k - 1 \) must divide \( 2^{2^k} - 1 \). This holds when \( k \) is a power of 2 (e.g., \( k = 2^m \)), ensuring \( 2^k - 1 \) is a Mersenne prime or a composite with suitable factors.

3. **Condition 3**: For \( n = 2^k \), \( n-2 = 2^k - 2 \) must divide \( 2^{2^k} - 2 \). This requires \( 2^k - 2 \) to factor into primes that each divide \( 2^{2^k} - 2 \). Testing shows this is true for \( k = 2, 4, 16 \), corresponding to \( n = 4, 16, 65536 \).

### Conclusion:

The integers satisfying all three conditions are \( n = 4, 16, 65536 \). These correspond to **Option F**.
