Alright, so I've got this question here about nature versus nurture and their influences on different types of differences. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The question is asking which part is more important for certain differences. The sentence structure is: "Nature is more important for ______ differences, while nurture has greater influence on ______ differences." So nature (which refers to genetics and biological factors) is more influential on the first blank, and nurture (which includes environment, upbringing, and experiences) is more influential on the second blank.

Looking at the options, they all seem to pair two terms for each blank. I need to figure out which terms are typically associated with nature and which with nurture.

First, let's think about what each term means:

- Structural: This might relate to physical structures, like the body or how it's built. That sounds more like something that's influenced by genetics, so nature.

- Psychological: This refers to mental processes, behaviors, and how we think. While some of this might be genetic, a lot is learned through environment and experiences, so nurture plays a role here too.

- Anatomical: This is about the structure of the body, like organs and tissues. Definitely nature because it's physical and biological.

- Social: This has to do with interactions and how we behave in society, which is heavily influenced by the environment and upbringing, so nurture.

- Psychological and social differences are more about behavior and how we interact, so nurture is key.

So putting it together, the first blank should be "structural and anatomical" since those are nature-related. The second blank should be "psychological and social" because those are influenced more by nurture.

Looking at the options, let's see which one matches this.

Option H says: anatomical and structural; social and psychological. Wait, the order is swapped. The first part would be anatomical and structural, which aligns with nature, but the second part is social and psychological, which are nurture. That seems correct. 

Wait, let me check the options again. Option H says "anatomical and structural; social and psychological." So first blank is anatomical and structural, second is social and psychological. That fits because nature (anatomical, structural) is first, and nurture (social, psychological) is second.

Wait, but the question says "Nature is more important for ______ differences, while nurture has greater influence on ______ differences." So the first blank should be the things nature is more important for, which are structural and anatomical. The second blank is the things nurture is more important for, which are social and psychological.

Looking again at the options, which option has the first part as structural and anatomical, and the second as social and psychological?

Looking at option H: "anatomical and structural; social and psychological." So first part is anatomical and structural (same as structural and anatomical, just swapped order), and second part is social and psychological. So yes, H fits.

Wait, but looking back, the first part of the sentence is "Nature is more important for ______ differences." So the first blank is the types of differences nature affects more, which are structural and anatomical. The second part is "nurture has greater influence on ______ differences," which are psychological and social.

So the first blank should be structural and anatomical, and the second should be psychological and social.

Looking at the options, option H is "anatomical and structural; social and psychological." So the first part is correct (they're just in a different order), and the second part is social and psychological, which is correct.

So the correct answer is H.

The correct answer is H: anatomical and structural; social and psychological.
