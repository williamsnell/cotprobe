Question:

A biology student from Nebraska, vacationing at a Virginia beach, observes that the level of activity of a fiddler crab changes with the cycle of the tides. When he brings some crabs back with him to Nebraska, he notices that a similar activity cycle is shown, yet there are no ocean beaches for miles. Explain.

Options:

A: The crab's activity cycle is influenced by barometric pressure changes
B: The crab's activity cycle is synchronized with the coastal tides they were originally exposed to
C: The crab's activity cycle is determined by the moon's gravitational pull
D: The crab's activity is random and shows no particular cycle
E: The crab's activity cycle is affected by the local environment
F: The crab's activity cycle is determined by artificial lighting conditions
G: The crab's activity cycle adapts to the nearest body of freshwater
H: The crab's activity cycle is influenced by the presence of sand
I: The crab's activity cycle is determined by the water level
J: The crab's activity cycle is set by the day-night cycle and unaffected by tidal patterns

Okay, so I have this biology question about fiddler crabs and their activity cycles. Let me try to break it down. The question is about why the crabs' activity changes with the tides in Virginia, but when taken to Nebraska, they still show a similar cycle even though there are no beaches nearby.

Hmm, I remember that fiddler crabs live in tidal flats and are influenced by tides. Tides are controlled by the moon's gravitational pull, right? So in Virginia, the crabs' activity would naturally follow the tidal cycles because the moon affects the ocean tides. But when the student brings them to Nebraska, which doesn't have ocean beaches, how do they still have a similar activity cycle?

Wait, maybe they're keeping the same internal schedule. I think some animals have circadian rhythms that are set by external factors like light or gravity. If the crabs were synchronized to the tidal patterns from their original environment, they might continue that behavior even without the actual tides. So their activity cycle is tied to the coastal tides they were exposed to before, not the new environment's conditions.

Looking at the options, option B says the cycle is synchronized with the coastal tides they were originally exposed to. That makes sense because once they're used to a certain tidal pattern, they might keep that up even when moved elsewhere. Other options like A (barometric pressure) or C (moon's gravity) could be factors, but the question is about why they maintain the cycle without the original tides. Option I suggests water level, but in Nebraska, there's no ocean, so water levels wouldn't be tidal. Option E says local environment, but they're in a new place, so the environment is different. Option J talks about day-night cycles, but the question mentions it's the same cycle as the tides, which are linked to moon phases, not just day-night.

So I think the best answer is B. The crabs are maintaining the activity cycle they learned from their original tidal environment.

The fiddler crabs' activity cycle is synchronized with the coastal tides they were originally exposed to, which explains why they maintain the same pattern even in a new environment without tidal influence.

Answer: B
