Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem says: A long, straight wire has a fixed negative charge with a linear charge density of magnitude 3.6 nC/m. This wire is enclosed by a coaxial, thin-walled nonconducting cylindrical shell. The shell has a radius of 1.5 cm, and it's supposed to have positive charge on its outside surface. The surface charge density σ is such that the net external electric field is zero. I need to find σ.

Hmm, okay. So the setup is a wire with negative charge inside a cylindrical shell. The shell is nonconducting, which probably means charges don't move freely on it, but since it's thin and coaxial, I guess the charges are on the surface.

Wait, but the shell is nonconducting but can have surface charge density. So the charges on the shell can't move; they stay where they are placed. That might affect how we calculate the electric field.

The main goal is to find the surface charge density σ on the outside of the shell that makes the net external electric field zero. Wait, external? So the field outside the shell is zero?

Wait, no, the problem states that the net external electric field is zero. So the electric field outside the shell is zero. That's interesting because normally, a charged cylinder would produce an electric field outside similar to a line charge. But here, the shell's charge is arranged so that the field outside is zero. So the shell's charge must be such that it cancels the field from the wire outside the shell.

But wait, the shell is a non-conducting cylinder, so it doesn't conduct. So the charges are fixed on the shell. Since the shell is nonconducting, the charges can't move, but they can be placed on the surface.

Wait, but the shell is a cylinder with radius 1.5 cm. Let me think about Gauss's Law here. Gauss's Law says that the electric flux through a closed surface is Q_enclosed / ε0.

So, for any Gaussian surface outside the shell, the total charge enclosed would be the sum of the charge on the wire and the charge on the shell. But wait, the shell is nonconducting, so the charge on the shell would be on the outer surface. Wait, but the problem says the shell has positive charge on its outside surface. So the shell itself has some charge, and the wire has a negative charge.

Wait, but the shell is nonconducting, so the charge on the shell can't redistribute. So the shell's charge is fixed on its outer surface. So when we consider a Gaussian surface outside the shell, the enclosed charge would be the sum of the wire's charge and the shell's charge.

But the problem states that the net external electric field is zero. So the electric field outside the shell is zero. That would mean that the total charge enclosed by any Gaussian surface outside the shell must be zero because E = 0 outside implies no net charge outside.

Wait, no. Because if the total charge enclosed by the Gaussian surface (which is outside the shell) is zero, then using Gauss's Law, the total electric flux would be Q_enc / ε0, which would be zero. So E * 4πr² = 0 → E=0.

So that suggests that the total enclosed charge inside the Gaussian surface (which is outside the shell) must be zero. But wait, the Gaussian surface is outside the shell, so the enclosed charge would be the charge on the wire plus the charge on the shell.

But the wire has a linear charge density λ = 3.6 nC/m, which is negative. So the wire's charge per unit length is λ_wire = -3.6e-9 C/m.

The shell has charge Q_shell on its outer surface. So the total charge enclosed by the Gaussian surface outside the shell would be λ_wire + λ_shell, where λ_shell is the line charge density of the shell.

Wait, but wait. The shell is a cylinder, so its charge per unit length would be σ * 2πr, where r is the radius of the shell, 1.5 cm = 0.015 m.

So λ_shell = σ * 2πr.

So the total enclosed charge per unit length is λ_total = λ_wire + λ_shell.

Since E outside is zero, then λ_total must be zero because, from Gauss's Law, the electric field outside a cylinder is (λ_enclosed / 2πε0 r) in magnitude. If E is zero, then λ_enclosed must be zero.

So setting λ_total = 0:

λ_wire + λ_shell = 0 → λ_shell = -λ_wire.

Since λ_wire is -3.6e-9 C/m, λ_shell would be 3.6e-9 C/m.

Wait, but wait a minute. The shell's charge is positive, as given in the problem. So if λ_shell is positive 3.6e-9 C/m, that would make sense because the wire is negative, so the shell's charge would have to be positive to cancel it.

But then, λ_shell = σ * 2πr → σ = λ_shell / (2πr).

Plugging in the numbers:

λ_shell = 3.6e-9 C/m.

r = 0.015 m.

So σ = (3.6e-9) / (2 * π * 0.015).

Let me calculate that.

First, compute the denominator: 2 * π ≈ 6.2832, times 0.015 is approximately 0.094248.

So σ ≈ 3.6e-9 / 0.094248 → approximately 3.816e-8 C/m².

Looking at the options, option A is 3.8e-8 C/m², option B is 4.8e-8, etc.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check my calculation.

Wait, 3.6e-9 divided by (2 * π * 0.015):

Let me compute 2πr: 2 * 3.1416 * 0.015 = 0.094248 m.

So 3.6e-9 / 0.094248 ≈ 3.816e-8 C/m².

So that's approximately 3.8e-8 C/m², which is option A.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is written as "3.8$$10^{-8}" which I think is a typo. Probably 3.8 ×10^-8, which matches what I have.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the setup.

Wait, the shell is nonconducting and thin-walled, so all the charge is on the outer surface. So the charge on the shell is only on the outside, so the Gaussian surface encloses both the wire and the shell's charge.

Yes, that's correct. So the total enclosed charge is λ_wire + λ_shell.

Since the wire is inside the shell, any Gaussian surface outside the shell would enclose both charges. For E to be zero, the total charge must be zero, so λ_shell = -λ_wire.

So λ_shell is positive 3.6e-9 C/m.

Then, the surface charge density σ is λ_shell / (2πr) because the circumference is 2πr, and per unit length, that's the charge per unit area.

Wait, because the shell is cylindrical, surface charge density σ is charge per unit area. The area per unit length is 2πr (the lateral surface area per unit length). So λ_shell = σ * 2πr → σ = λ_shell/(2πr).

Yes, that's correct.

So the calculation seems correct. So σ is approximately 3.8e-8 C/m², which is option A.

Wait, but looking back at the options, option A is written as "3.8$$10^{-8}", which might be a formatting issue. I think it's intended to be 3.8 ×10^-8. So the answer should be option A.

To solve the problem, we apply Gauss's Law. The wire has a linear charge density of \( \lambda_{\text{wire}} = -3.6 \, \text{nC/m} \), and the goal is to find the surface charge density \( \sigma \) on the outer surface of the cylindrical shell such that the net external electric field is zero.

For the electric field to be zero outside the shell, the total enclosed charge within any Gaussian surface outside the shell must be zero. This means the total linear charge density (\( \lambda_{\text{total}} \)) of the wire and the shell must cancel each other:

\[
\lambda_{\text{total}} = \lambda_{\text{wire}} + \lambda_{\text{shell}} = 0
\]

Solving for \( \lambda_{\text{shell}} \):

\[
\lambda_{\text{shell}} = -\lambda_{\text{wire}} = 3.6 \, \text{nC/m}
\]

The shell's charge per unit length is related to its surface charge density \( \sigma \) by:

\[
\lambda_{\text{shell}} = \sigma \cdot 2\pi r
\]

Rearranging for \( \sigma \):

\[
\sigma = \frac{\lambda_{\text{shell}}}{2\pi r}
\]

Substituting the values \( \lambda_{\text{shell}} = 3.6 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{C/m} \) and \( r = 0.015 \, \text{m} \):

\[
\sigma = \frac{3.6 \times 10^{-9}}{2 \cdot \pi \cdot 0.015} \approx 3.8 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{C/m}^2
\]

Thus, the surface charge density \( \sigma \) is approximately \( 3.8 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{C/m}^2 \), which corresponds to option A.
