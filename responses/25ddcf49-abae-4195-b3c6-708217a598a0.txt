Okay, so I have this question about antennas, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me start by understanding what the question is asking. The question is about finding the maximum effective aperture of an antenna given its directivity and the operating wavelength. 

First, let me recall what I know about antennas. I remember that the effective aperture, also known as effective area, is a measure of how much power an antenna can receive. It's related to the antenna's gain and other factors. Directivity is a measure of how well an antenna radiates energy in a particular direction compared to an isotropic radiator, which radiates equally in all directions.

The formula I think I need here is the one that relates effective aperture (A_eff) to the directivity (D) and the wavelength (λ). I believe the formula is A_eff = (λ² * D) / (4π). Wait, I'm not entirely sure about that. Alternatively, I remember that for an antenna, the effective aperture is also related to the gain (G) and the wavelength. The formula I'm recalling is A_eff = (λ² * G) / (4π). But wait, isn't directivity (D) sometimes used interchangeably with gain (G), but gain is the power ratio, while directivity is the intensity ratio? Hmm, maybe I should double-check that.

Wait, I think directivity (D) is the ratio of the maximum intensity (in the direction of the maximum) to the average intensity over all directions. Gain (G) includes both the directivity and the efficiency of the antenna. So, if the antenna is 100% efficient, then G equals D. But in this question, I'm only given directivity, so perhaps I can proceed under the assumption that the efficiency is 100% for the purpose of calculating maximum effective aperture. Or maybe the formula I'm supposed to use relates A_eff directly to D without considering efficiency.

Let me think again. The maximum effective aperture (A_eff) is given by the formula: A_eff = (λ² * D) / (4π). Wait, no, I might be mixing something up. Another formula I recall is that the effective aperture A is related to the gain G as A = (λ² G) / (4π). But if the question is about maximum effective aperture, perhaps it's considering the maximum possible, which would be when the gain is maximum, so when the antenna is as directive as possible.

Wait, but wait, the directivity D is the same as the gain when the antenna is perfectly efficient. So maybe in this case, since the question gives D, I can use that in place of G. So A_eff = (λ² * D) / (4π). 

Let me plug in the numbers. The wavelength λ is given as 4 meters. Directivity D is 50. So λ squared is 4^2 = 16 m². Multiply that by D: 16 m² * 50 = 800 m². Then divide by (4π). So 800 / (4 * π) = 800 / 12.566... Approximately 63.66 m². 

Wait, that's about 63.66, which is one of the options. Looking at the options, option H is 63.6 m². So that seems to be the answer.

Wait a second, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes the formula might be different. Let me make sure I'm using the right formula. The effective area A is also given by A = (λ² η G) / (4π), where η is the efficiency. But if the question is about maximum effective aperture, perhaps it's assuming 100% efficiency, so η =1. But wait, in that case, the formula would be A = (λ² G) / (4π), but G is the same as D when η=1. So yeah, that's correct.

Alternatively, I've seen another formula where the effective aperture is A_eff = (λ² * D) / (4π). So that's consistent with what I did earlier.

Wait, but sometimes the formula is written in terms of the effective aperture as (D * λ²) / (4π), which is what I did. So with λ=4, D=50, that gives (16 *50)/(4pi)= (800)/(12.566)≈63.66, which matches option H.

So the answer should be H: 63.6 m².

The question involves calculating the maximum effective aperture of an antenna given its directivity and operating wavelength. The formula used is \( A_{\text{eff}} = \frac{\lambda^2 \cdot D}{4\pi} \), where \( \lambda = 4 \, \text{m} \) and \( D = 50 \). Substituting the values, \( \lambda^2 = 16 \, \text{m}^2 \), and \( A_{\text{eff}} = \frac{16 \cdot 50}{4\pi} = \frac{800}{12.566} \approx 63.6 \, \text{m}^2 \). This matches option H.
