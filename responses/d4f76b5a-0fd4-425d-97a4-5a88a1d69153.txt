Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about baking powder. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on stoichiometry, but I'll give it a shot.

The question says that baking powder is a mix of cream of tartar (which is potassium hydrogen tartrate, KHC4H4O6) and baking soda (sodium bicarbonate, NaHCO3). They react according to the equation: KHC4H4O6 + NaHCO3 → KNaC4H4O6 + H2O + CO2. I need to find out how much baking soda to add to 8.0 grams of cream of tartar so that both react completely.

First, I think I should check the balanced equation. Wait, looking at the reaction, each mole of cream of tartar reacts with one mole of baking soda. Yeah, because the coefficients are both 1. So the mole ratio is 1:1.

Next, I'll calculate the moles of cream of tartar I have. The molecular weight of KHC4H4O6 is given as 188 g/mol. So moles = mass / molecular weight. That would be 8.0 g / 188 g/mol. Let me calculate that: 8 divided by 188. Hmm, 188 times 0.04 is 7.52, so 8 is a bit more than 0.0425 moles? Wait, let me do it accurately. 188 goes into 8 how many times? 188 * 0.0425 is 8. So 8.0 / 188 = 0.0425 moles? Wait, 0.0425 * 188 is 8, right? Because 0.04 *188=7.52, 0.0025*188=4.7, so total 7.52 +4.7=12.22? Wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, wait, 0.0425 is 4.25e-2. Let me compute 8 / 188. 188 is approximately 188. Let me do this: 188 times 0.04 is 7.52. 188 *0.0425 is 0.04 *188=7.52, 0.0025*188=4.7, so 7.52 +4.7=12.22? Wait, that's more than 8, so I must have messed up. Oh wait, no, 0.0425 *188 is 8 grams. Because 0.0425 * 188. Let me compute 188 * 0.0425: 0.04 *188=7.52, 0.0025*188=4.7, so 7.52 +4.7=12.22? No, that can't be. Wait, 0.0425 is 42.5%, so 188 * 0.0425 is (188 *42.5)/1000. Let me compute 188 *42.5. 188 *40 is 7520, 188*2.5 is 470. So total 7520 +470 =7990. Divide by 1000, it's 7.99 grams. Oh, right, so 0.0425 moles of KHC4H4O6 gives 7.99 grams, which is about 8 grams. So yes, moles of cream of tartar is 8/188 = 0.0425 (exactly 0.0425) moles. So that's 0.0425 moles.

Since the reaction is 1:1, the moles of NaHCO3 needed are also 0.0425 moles. Now, the molecular weight of NaHCO3 is 84 g/mol. So mass = moles * molar mass. So 0.0425 *84 = let's calculate that. 0.04 *84 is 3.36, 0.0025 *84=0.21. So 3.36 + 0.21=3.57 grams. Hmm, but looking at the options, I don't see 3.57. Let me check the options again. Options are A:2.8, B:5.1, C:6.2, D:3.2, E:7.0, F:2.2, G:4.0, H:4.3, I:1.7, J:3.6. So 3.57 is closest to option J, which is 3.6g. But wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Wait, 8 grams of KHC4H4O6 is 8 / 188. Let me compute that more accurately. 188 goes into 8 zero times. 80 divided by 188 is 0.425, so 0.0425 moles, correct. Then, 0.0425 moles of NaHCO3: 0.0425 *84. Let's compute 84 *0.04 =3.36, 84*0.0025=0.21. So 3.36 +0.21=3.57 grams. So that's about 3.57g, which rounds to 3.6g. So the answer should be J.

Wait, but let me think again. Did I mess up any step? Hmm.

Wait, another way to check: 0.0425 moles of NaHCO3. So 0.0425 *84. Let me compute 84 * 0.0425. 84 *0.04 is 3.36, 84 *0.0025 is 0.21. So 3.36 +0.21=3.57g. Yep, that's correct.

So the correct answer is J:3.6g.

To determine how much baking soda (NaHCO₃) is needed to react completely with 8.0 g of cream of tartar (KHC₄H₄O₆), we start by noting the balanced reaction equation:

\[
\text{KHC}_4\text{H}_4\text{O}_6 + \text{NaHCO}_3 \rightarrow \text{KNaC}_4\text{H}_4\text{O}_6 + \text{H}_2\text{O} + \text{CO}_2
\]

The mole ratio of cream of tartar to baking soda is 1:1. 

1. **Calculate moles of cream of tartar**:  
   The molecular weight of KHC₄H₄O₆ is 188 g/mol.  
   \[
   \text{Moles of KHC}_4\text{H}_4\text{O}_6 = \frac{8.0 \, \text{g}}{188 \, \text{g/mol}} = 0.0425 \, \text{moles}
   \]

2. **Determine moles of baking soda needed**:  
   Since the mole ratio is 1:1, moles of NaHCO₃ required = 0.0425 moles.

3. **Calculate mass of baking soda**:  
   The molecular weight of NaHCO₃ is 84 g/mol.  
   \[
   \text{Mass of NaHCO}_3 = 0.0425 \, \text{moles} \times 84 \, \text{g/mol} = 3.57 \, \text{g}
   \]

4. **Select the closest option**:  
   The calculated mass of 3.57 g rounds to 3.6 g, which corresponds to option **J**.

Answer: J
