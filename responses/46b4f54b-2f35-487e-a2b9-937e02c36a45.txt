Okay, so I need to find the median of the numbers 5, 8, 12, 3, and 9. Hmm, I remember that the median is the middle number when the numbers are arranged in order. But wait, let me make sure I get this right. First, I should probably sort the numbers from smallest to largest. Let me list them out: 3, 5, 8, 9, 12. Yeah, that seems right.

Now, since there are five numbers, which is an odd count, the median should be the third number in this sorted list. So counting them: the first is 3, second is 5, third is 8. That means the median is 8. Let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Did I sort them correctly? Yes, 3 is the smallest, then 5, then 8, then 9, then 12. And the middle one is definitely 8. So looking at the options, B is 8. I think that's the correct answer.
