Okay, so I have this question about the biggest risk factor for infection with Ebola. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

First, I remember that Ebola is a virus that's transmitted through contact with bodily fluids. So, the main ways it spreads are through blood, saliva, sweat, vomit, urine, feces, and semen. It's not airborne like the flu, so you can't catch it just by being near someone who's coughing. Instead, direct contact with these fluids is key.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Working in a category IV laboratory. Category IV labs handle the most dangerous pathogens, requiring maximum containment. So, if someone works there, they'd have a high risk because they're handling the virus under controlled conditions but with strict protocols. However, in reality, lab workers are usually well-trained and use protective gear, so maybe the risk isn't the highest unless there's an accident.

Option B: Attending a funeral of a victim outside. Funerals, especially in certain cultures, involve handling the body, which can include touching or washing the corpse. Ebola is highly contagious, and if the body is not properly handled, there's a high risk of spreading the virus. I think this is a significant factor because during outbreaks, many cases come from funeral practices where people come into contact with infected bodies without proper protection.

Option C: Nursing a patient at home. Caring for someone with Ebola at home might involve close contact, but if the patient is isolated and proper precautions are taken, the risk might be lower. However, in many cases, especially in less developed areas, people might not have access to proper protective gear, so this could be risky. But is it the biggest?

Option D: Attending football matches or large gatherings. Large crowds aren't really a direct risk for Ebola because it's not airborne. Unless someone is coughing or sneezing and you're in close contact, which isn't typical for Ebola. So this might be the lowest risk among the options.

So, thinking about it, the biggest risk factor would be where you're directly exposed to infected bodily fluids without proper protection. Attending a funeral (Option B) seems to fit because handling the body during burial practices can involve a lot of contact, especially in regions where traditional practices might not use protective gear. Plus, funerals often bring together many people, increasing the chance of spread.

Wait, but what about healthcare workers? They're at higher risk, but that's not listed here. The options don't include that, so among the given choices, attending a funeral stands out as a major risk because it's a common way the virus spreads, especially in areas without proper health infrastructure.

The biggest risk factor for infection with Ebola is attending the funeral of a victim, as it involves direct contact with infected bodily fluids without proper protective measures. 

Answer: B
