Okay, so I have this polynomial: 8x³ + 6x² - 9x +24. I need to determine if it satisfies the Eisenstein criterion for irreducibility over Q. Hmm, Eisenstein's criterion is a way to test if a polynomial is irreducible over the rationals. I remember that the criterion involves finding a prime number p that divides all coefficients except the leading one, p doesn't divide the leading coefficient, and p squared doesn't divide the constant term.

Let me write down the polynomial again: 8x³ +6x² -9x +24. The coefficients are 8, 6, -9, 24. 

So, I need to find a prime p such that:
1. p divides 6, -9, and 24 (the coefficients except the leading term 8).
2. p does not divide 8 (the leading coefficient).
3. p² does not divide 24 (the constant term).

Let me look at the coefficients: 6, -9, 24. I need a prime that divides all of these. Let's list the primes and see.

Possible primes could be 2, 3, maybe others. Let's check each option given.

Option A says p=7. Does 7 divide 6? No, because 6 divided by 7 is not an integer. So 7 is out.

Option B is "No, but it's irreducible over Z." I don't know yet if it's irreducible, so I'll wait.

Option C is p=3. Let's check. Does 3 divide 6? Yes, 6/3=2. Does 3 divide -9? Yes, -9/3=-3. Does 3 divide 24? Yes, 24/3=8. Now, does 3 divide the leading coefficient 8? 8 divided by 3 is not an integer, so no. Next, check if 3 squared (9) divides 24. 24 divided by 9 is 2.666..., which is not an integer. So 9 doesn't divide 24. So all conditions are met with p=3. That would mean the polynomial satisfies Eisenstein's criterion with p=3, so option C would be correct.

But wait, let me double-check the other options to make sure. Let's see.

Option D: p=5. Does 5 divide 6? No, so D is out.

Option E: "No, but it's reducible over Z." I don't think it's reducible because if Eisenstein applies, it's irreducible over Q, hence also over Z.

Option F: p=6. Wait, 6 is not a prime number. Eisenstein's requires a prime, so F is invalid.

Option G: p=8. 8 isn't prime either, so G is out.

Option H: p=2. Let's check. Does 2 divide 6, -9, 24? 6/2=3, yes. -9/2 is -4.5, which isn't an integer, so 2 doesn't divide -9. So condition 1 fails. Thus, H is out.

Option I: "No." Well, if C is correct, then I is wrong.

Option J: p=4. Not a prime, so J is invalid.

So the only possible correct option is C: Yes, with p=3.

Wait, but let me think again. Sometimes, after applying Eisenstein, you might need to adjust the polynomial if it's not in the right form. For example, if you can make a substitution like x -> x+1 and then apply Eisenstein. But in this case, the original polynomial as it is already satisfies the conditions with p=3. So yes, it should be irreducible over Q.
</think>

The polynomial \(8x^3 + 6x^2 - 9x + 24\) satisfies Eisenstein's criterion with \(p=3\). All coefficients except the leading term are divisible by 3, 3 does not divide the leading coefficient 8, and \(3^2 = 9\) does not divide the constant term 24. Thus, the polynomial is irreducible over \(\mathbb{Q}\).

Answer: C
