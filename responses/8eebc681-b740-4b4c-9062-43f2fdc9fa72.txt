Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the Fourier cosine series for a given function f(x) over the interval from 0 to π. The function f(x) is defined as 0 when x is between 0 and π/2, and 1 when x is between π/2 and π. The options are labeled A to J, each giving a different series representation.

First, I remember that Fourier series can represent a periodic function as a sum of sines and cosines. Since the problem specifies a cosine series, I think we're dealing with a Fourier cosine series, which is typically used for even extensions of functions defined on half-intervals, like [0, π] in this case.

The general form of a Fourier cosine series is:

f(x) = a0/2 + Σ [an * cos(nx)]

where the sum is from n=0 to infinity. Here, the coefficients an are calculated using the integral of f(x) multiplied by cos(nx) over the interval [0, π].

So, for this function, I need to compute the coefficients a0 and an.

Let's write down the formulas:

a0 = (2/π) ∫₀^π f(x) dx

an = (2/π) ∫₀^π f(x) cos(nx) dx

Given f(x) is 0 from 0 to π/2 and 1 from π/2 to π, the integrals will split into two parts.

Calculating a0 first:

a0 = (2/π) [ ∫₀^{π/2} 0 dx + ∫_{π/2}^π 1 dx ]

The first integral is zero, and the second is ∫ dx from π/2 to π, which equals (π - π/2) = π/2.

So a0 = (2/π) * (π/2) = 1.

So the series starts with (1/2)*a0 = 1/2.

Now, for an:

an = (2/π) [ ∫₀^{π/2} 0 * cos(nx) dx + ∫_{π/2}^π 1 * cos(nx) dx ]

Again, the first integral is zero. The second integral is ∫_{π/2}^π cos(nx) dx.

Let me compute that integral:

∫ cos(nx) dx = (1/n) sin(nx) evaluated from π/2 to π.

So,

(1/n) [ sin(nπ) - sin(nπ/2) ]

I know that sin(nπ) is zero for all integer n. So this simplifies to -(1/n) sin(nπ/2).

So,

an = (2/π) * [ -(1/n) sin(nπ/2) ]

Which simplifies to:

an = - (2)/(n π) sin(nπ/2)

Now, let's think about sin(nπ/2). For integer n, this alternates between 0, 1, 0, -1, etc. Specifically:

- When n is even (n=2k), sin(nπ/2) = sin(kπ) = 0.
- When n is odd (n=2k+1), sin(nπ/2) = sin((2k+1)π/2) = (-1)^k.

So, for n=1: sin(π/2)=1
n=2: sin(π)=0
n=3: sin(3π/2)=-1
n=4: sin(2π)=0
and so on.

Therefore, an is non-zero only when n is odd. Let me represent n as 2k+1, where k starts from 0.

So, substituting n=2k+1,

an = - (2)/( (2k+1) π ) * (-1)^k
= (2)/( (2k+1) π ) * (-1)^{k+1}

Wait, because sin(nπ/2) for n=2k+1 is (-1)^k, right? Because when k=0, n=1: sin(π/2)=1 = (-1)^0=1. For k=1, n=3: sin(3π/2)=-1= (-1)^1. So yes, that part is correct.

So, substituting back, an becomes:

an = (2)/(π (2k+1)) * (-1)^{k}

Wait, let me make sure. The expression was:

an = - (2)/(n π) sin(nπ/2)

Since n=2k+1, sin(nπ/2) = (-1)^k. So,

an = - (2)/( (2k+1) π ) * (-1)^k
= [2/( (2k+1) π ) ] * (-1)^{k+1}

Wait, that would give an = [2/( (2k+1) π ) ] * (-1)^{k+1}

But when n=2k+1, the coefficient an is non-zero only for odd n. So perhaps it's better to express the series in terms of an for n odd.

So, our Fourier series now is:

f(x) = 1/2 + Σ [ an cos(nx) ] from n=1 to ∞, where an is as above.

But since an is zero for even n, we can write the sum only over odd n.

Alternatively, we can express n as 2k+1, so k starts from 0.

Let me reindex the sum. Let’s let n = 2k + 1, where k goes from 0 to ∞.

So, the sum becomes:

Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ (2/( (2k+1) π )) * (-1)^{k+1} ] cos( (2k+1)x )

So,

f(x) = 1/2 + Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ (2 (-1)^{k+1} ) / ( (2k+1) π ) ] cos( (2k+1)x )

We can factor out the (-1)^{k+1} as (-1) * (-1)^k, so:

= 1/2 - (2/π) Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ (-1)^k / (2k+1) ] cos( (2k+1)x )

So, the series is:

f(x) = 1/2 - (2/π) Σ_{n=0}^∞ [ (-1)^n cos( (2n+1)x ) ] / (2n + 1 )

Wait, but in the sum, when n=k, it's written as 2n+1, so yes, substituting n for k, that's correct.

Looking at the options, let's see which one matches this expression.

Looking through the options:

Option F: f(x)= (1 / 2) - (2 / π) ∞ sum_{n=0} [ (-1)^n [cos(2n +1)] / (2n +1) ]

Wait, but in our series, it's cos( (2n+1)x ), right? Because the argument of the cosine is (2n+1)x.

Looking at option F: the cosine term is cos(2n +1), which I think is supposed to be cos( (2n+1)x ). So perhaps that's a typo in the option, but perhaps they mean cos( (2n+1)x ). Similarly, other options may not match.

Looking at the options:

A: sin(n) in numerator, which doesn't match because we have cos(2n+1)x.

B: cos(2n)x, which would be even multiples, but our terms are odd multiples (2n+1)x.

C: sin(2n +1), no, we have cos terms.

D: cos(n), n is not multiplied by x.

E: tan, no.

F: cos(2n +1), but without x. Wait, but in the given option, it's written as cos(2n +1), which is a bit unclear. Wait, perhaps it's a typo, and should be cos( (2n+1)x ), which would match our series.

Option F says:

f(x) = (1/2) - (2/π) ∞ sum_{n=0} [ (-1)^n [cos(2n+1)] / (2n+1) ]

Wait, but that would be cos(2n+1), which is just a constant, but in our case, it's cos( (2n+1)x ). So perhaps option F is written incorrectly, but maybe it's a typo and the argument includes x.

Alternatively, perhaps the options have a mistake, so I need to look again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check.

Wait, when I calculated an, I had:

an = (2/π) * [ integral from π/2 to π of cos(nx) dx ]

Which is (2/π) [ (sin(nx)/n ) evaluated from π/2 to π ]

So that's (2/π) [ (sin(nπ) - sin(nπ/2)) / n ]

Since sin(nπ) is zero, we get:

an = (2/(n π)) [ - sin(nπ/2) ]

Which is:

an = - (2 sin(nπ/2) ) / (n π )

Now, when n is even, sin(nπ/2) is zero, so only odd n contribute.

So for n=2k+1,

an = - (2 (-1)^k ) / ( (2k+1) π )

Because sin( (2k+1)π/2 ) = (-1)^k.

So, an = [ 2 (-1)^{k+1} ] / [ (2k+1) π ]

So, the Fourier series is:

f(x) = 1/2 + Σ [ an cos(nx) ] for n=1 to ∞.

But since an is non-zero only for odd n, we can write:

f(x) = 1/2 + Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ (2 (-1)^{k+1} ) / ( (2k+1) π ) ] cos( (2k+1) x )

Which can be rewritten as:

f(x) = 1/2 - (2/π) Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ (-1)^k / (2k+1) ] cos( (2k+1) x )

So, the series is 1/2 minus (2/π) times the sum from n=0 to ∞ of [ (-1)^n cos( (2n+1)x ) ] / (2n+1 )

Looking at the options, let's see which one matches this.

Option F says:

f(x)= (1 / 2) - (2 / \pi) \infty \sum_{n=0} (- 1)^n [{cos(2n + 1)} / (2n + 1)]

Wait, the way it's written, the argument inside cos is (2n+1), which is a number, but it should be a function of x, i.e., cos( (2n+1)x ). So perhaps it's a typo, and the correct expression includes x.

If that's the case, then option F is the correct one, because it has cos(2n+1) which should be cos( (2n+1)x ). So, the series matches.

Alternatively, another option: looking at option F, the sum starts at n=0, which is correct because when n=0, it's cos(1x), which is the first term.

Wait, but let me check other options.

Option B has cos(2n), which would be even multiples, but we have cos(2n+1)x, so B is incorrect.

Option C has sin(2n+1), which is sine, so not matching.

Option F is the only one that has cos(2n+1), assuming that the x is missing in the option. Alternatively, perhaps the options have a typo, but given the options, F is the closest match.

Wait, let me check option J: cos(2n+1) over (2n+2), but the denominator is 2n+2, which doesn't match our 2n+1.

Option J is:

f(x)= (1 / 2) - (2 / \pi) \infty \sum_{n=0} (- 1)^n [ {cos(2n + 1)} / (2n + 2) ]

No, denominator is wrong.

Option I has sin terms, which don't match.

Option F: the denominator is 2n+1, which matches. So, considering that, I think option F is correct, even though the argument in the cosine might be missing the x, perhaps it's a typo.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me think again.

Wait, another way to approach this is to recall that the Fourier cosine series for a function that's 0 on [0, a] and 1 on [a, b] is a standard form. But I'm not sure of the exact form, so perhaps I should proceed differently.

Alternatively, perhaps I can recognize the series from known expansions. For example, the Fourier series for f(x)=1 on [0, π/2] and 0 elsewhere is known, but in this case, f(x) is 0 on [0, π/2] and 1 on [π/2, π].

Wait, another approach: the function is a rectangular function, so its Fourier series will involve a cosine series with coefficients that alternate in sign because the function is piecewise constant with a jump discontinuity.

Looking at the options again, option F has the correct form, assuming the argument includes x. So I think the correct answer is F.

The function f(x) is defined as 0 on [0, π/2] and 1 on [π/2, π]. To find its Fourier cosine series, we compute the coefficients a0 and an using the integral formulas for the Fourier cosine series. 

1. **Compute a0**:
   \[
   a_0 = \frac{2}{\pi} \int_0^\pi f(x) \, dx = \frac{2}{\pi} \left( \int_0^{\pi/2} 0 \, dx + \int_{\pi/2}^\pi 1 \, dx \right) = \frac{2}{\pi} \cdot \frac{\pi}{2} = 1
   \]

2. **Compute an**:
   \[
   a_n = \frac{2}{\pi} \int_0^\pi f(x) \cos(nx) \, dx = \frac{2}{\pi} \left( \int_0^{\pi/2} 0 \cdot \cos(nx) \, dx + \int_{\pi/2}^\pi \cos(nx) \, dx \right)
   \]
   The second integral evaluates to:
   \[
   \int_{\pi/2}^\pi \cos(nx) \, dx = \left. \frac{\sin(nx)}{n} \right|_{\pi/2}^\pi = \frac{\sin(n\pi) - \sin(n\pi/2)}{n} = -\frac{\sin(n\pi/2)}{n}
   \]
   Since \(\sin(n\pi) = 0\) for integer \(n\), we have:
   \[
   a_n = -\frac{2}{n\pi} \sin\left(\frac{n\pi}{2}\right)
   \]
   For even \(n\), \(\sin(n\pi/2) = 0\), so only odd \(n\) contribute. Let \(n = 2k + 1\), then:
   \[
   a_n = \frac{2(-1)^{k+1}}{(2k+1)\pi}
   \]

3. **Construct the series**:
   Substituting back, the Fourier cosine series is:
   \[
   f(x) = \frac{1}{2} - \frac{2}{\pi} \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^n \cos((2n+1)x)}{2n+1}
   \]
   This matches the form given in **Option F**, assuming the argument of the cosine includes \(x\).
