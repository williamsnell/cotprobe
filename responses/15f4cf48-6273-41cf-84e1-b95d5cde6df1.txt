Okay, so I have this problem where Harry gets a 4% commission on all his sales. Last week, he sold $2,100 worth of goods, and I need to figure out how much his commission was. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that commission is calculated as a percentage of the total sales. So, in this case, Harry's commission rate is 4%, and his sales were $2,100. To find the commission, I need to calculate 4% of $2,100.

Hmm, how do I calculate that? Well, percentages can be converted to decimals to make the multiplication easier. So, 4% as a decimal is 0.04. Then, I multiply this decimal by the total sales amount.

Let me write that out: 0.04 multiplied by 2,100. Let me do the math. 0.04 times 2,000 would be 80, because 0.04 times 2,000 is 80. Then, 0.04 times 100 is 4. So adding those together, 80 plus 4 is 84. Wait, that doesn't seem right because looking at the options, E is $84, but I think I might have made a mistake. Let me check again.

Oh wait, no, I think I did it right. Wait, 4% of 2,100. Let me try another way. 1% of 2,100 is 21, so 4% would be 4 times 21, which is 84. So that's correct. So the commission should be $84, which is option E.

Wait, but looking at the options again, option E is $84, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes I might mix up the decimal places. Let me try another method to confirm. Maybe using fractions. 4% is the same as 4/100, so 4/100 of 2,100. So 2,100 divided by 100 is 21, then multiplied by 4 gives 84. Yep, that's consistent.

So I'm confident now that the correct answer is E: $84.

The commission is calculated by finding 4% of $2,100. Converting 4% to a decimal gives 0.04. Multiplying 0.04 by 2,100 results in $84. Therefore, the correct answer is E.

Answer: E
