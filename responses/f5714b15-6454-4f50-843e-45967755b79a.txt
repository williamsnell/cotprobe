Okay, so I have this genetics problem here about garden peas. Let me try to break it down step by step. The question is about finding the proportion of progeny that will have constricted pods when you mate full-podded plants with each other. 

First, I remember that in genetics, especially when dealing with traits like pod shape, we often use Mendel's laws. The problem mentions that the population is in genetic equilibrium, which I think means it's in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. So that's a hint that I can use the Hardy-Weinberg principle to solve this.

The genes involved are F for full pods and f for constricted pods. The frequencies given are p = 0.7 for F and q = 0.3 for f. Since p and q are the allele frequencies, and they add up to 1 (0.7 + 0.3 = 1), that checks out.

Now, the parents are all full-podded, which means they have at least one F allele. But wait, what's the genotype of these parents? In a selfing or crossing scenario, the parents can be either FF, Ff, or ff. But since they're full-podded, they can't be ff because that's constricted pods. So the possible genotypes are FF or Ff.

Wait, but the question says the parents are full-podded. So all the parents are either FF or Ff. But the population is in H-W equilibrium, so the genotype frequencies are p², 2pq, q². So the frequency of FF is p² = (0.7)^2 = 0.49, Ff is 2pq = 2*(0.7)*(0.3) = 0.42, and ff is 0.3^2 = 0.09. But since the parents are full-podded, we're only considering the FF and Ff plants. 

Wait, no. The parents are all full-podded. So in this case, when we're looking at the mating of full-podded × full-podded, we need to consider what their possible genotypes are. But the question is about the progeny from these matings. So perhaps I should find the genotype frequencies of the parents first.

Wait, no. The problem states that the parents are full-podded. So all the parents are F_ (either FF or Ff). But to find the proportion of their offspring that have constricted pods (ff), I need to know the genotype of each parent in the cross. However, the way the question is phrased, it's about all possible matings of full-podded plants. So I think I need to consider the distribution of genotypes among the full-podded plants and then compute the expected offspring.

So first, the genotype frequencies in the population are 0.49 FF, 0.42 Ff, and 0.09 ff. But since we're only considering full-podded plants (which are the parents), the frequencies among these are adjusted. The total proportion of full-podded plants is 0.49 + 0.42 = 0.91. So the probability that a full-podded plant is FF is 0.49 / 0.91, and Ff is 0.42 / 0.91.

So when we mate two full-podded plants, the possible crosses are:

1. FF × FF
2. FF × Ff
3. FF × (any F_)
4. Ff × Ff
5. Ff × FF
6. Ff × Ff

Wait, but since the parents are all F_, the possible matings are between different combinations of F_ plants. But perhaps a better way is to model the probability of each parent's genotype and then compute the average offspring.

So each parent is either FF or Ff. The chance that a parent is FF is (0.49 / 0.91) ≈ 0.5385, and Ff is (0.42 / 0.91) ≈ 0.4615.

Now, when you mate two F_ plants, the possible offspring's probability depends on the parents' genotypes.

Let me list the possible crosses:

- Both parents are FF. The offspring will all be FF. So no constricted pods.

- One parent is FF, the other is Ff. The offspring will be FF (from FF × Ff: all offspring are F_ because F is dominant. So in this case, all offspring are either FF or Ff. Wait, no, the cross is FF (homozygous) with Ff (heterozygous). So each gamete from FF is F, and from Ff is 50% F and 50% f. So the possible offspring are all F_ (since F is dominant). So no constricted pods here either. So the constricted pods can only come from when both parents are Ff, because then their offspring can be ff.

Wait, no. Let me think again. If both parents are Ff, then the cross is Ff × Ff. In that case, the possible offspring genotypes are FF (25%), Ff (50%), and ff (25%). So the proportion of constricted pods (ff) is 25% or 0.25.

So the overall probability of constricted pods in the progeny depends on the probability that both parents are Ff. Because only then can the offspring have a chance to be ff.

So let me calculate the probability that both parents are Ff.

The probability that one parent is Ff is 0.4615. So the probability that both parents are Ff is (0.4615)^2 ≈ 0.213.

In that case, the chance of an offspring being ff is 25% (0.25). So the contribution to the total constricted is 0.213 * 0.25 ≈ 0.05325.

Wait, but that's the only scenario where ff can occur. Are there other scenarios where ff can happen? Let's see.

If one parent is FF and the other is Ff, their offspring can't be ff because the FF parent only gives F gametes. So all offspring are F_. So no constricted pods.

If one parent is FF and the other is also FF, all offspring are FF, so no ff.

If one parent is Ff and the other is FF, same as above.

So the only way to get ff is when both parents are Ff.

So the total proportion of constricted-podded progeny is 0.05325, which is approximately 0.0532.

Looking at the options, option G is 0.0532.

To determine the proportion of progeny with constricted pods (ff) resulting from matings of full-podded (F_) plants, we use the Hardy-Weinberg principle. The allele frequencies are given as \( p = 0.7 \) (F) and \( q = 0.3 \) (f). The genotype frequencies in the population are:

- \( FF = p^2 = 0.49 \),
- \( Ff = 2pq = 0.42 \),
- \( ff = q^2 = 0.09 \).

Since only full-podded plants (FF or Ff) are used as parents, the adjusted frequencies among these plants are:

- \( FF = \frac{0.49}{0.91} \approx 0.5385 \),
- \( Ff = \frac{0.42}{0.91} \approx 0.4615 \).

To produce constricted-podded progeny (ff), both parents must be Ff. The probability of both parents being Ff is:

\[
P(\text{both Ff}) = (0.4615)^2 \approx 0.213.
\]

When two Ff plants mate, the offspring genotypes follow a 1:2:1 ratio. The probability of producing an ff offspring is:

\[
P(ff | \text{Ff} \times \text{Ff}) = 0.25.
\]

Thus, the overall proportion of constricted-podded progeny is:

\[
P(ff) = P(\text{both Ff}) \times P(ff | \text{Ff} \times \text{Ff}) = 0.213 \times 0.25 \approx 0.0532.
\]

From the options provided, the correct answer is:

G: 0.0532.
