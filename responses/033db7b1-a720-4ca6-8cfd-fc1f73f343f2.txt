Okay, so I have this Python question here, and I need to figure out what sum(l) is when l is the list [1,2,3,4]. Hmm, I'm a bit new to Python, but I remember that sum() is a built-in function. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I know that sum() takes an iterable as its argument. In this case, the list [1,2,3,4] is definitely an iterable. So sum(l) should add all the elements together. Let me add them manually: 1 plus 2 is 3, plus 3 makes 6, and then adding 4 brings it to 10. So the sum should be 10.

Looking at the options, option B is 10. That must be the correct answer. I don't think there are any tricks here because the list is straightforward, and sum() just adds the numbers. I don't see any other functions or operations involved. So yeah, I'm confident that B is the right choice.
