Okay, I need to figure out the answers to these two statements about machine learning. Let's take them one by one.

Statement 1: Traditional machine learning results assume that the train and test sets are independent and identically distributed. Hmm, I remember from my studies that the i.i.d. assumption is a fundamental concept in traditional machine learning. It means that each example in the test set is drawn from the same distribution as the training data, and that each example is independent of the others. So, Statement 1 is True. I think that's correct because without this assumption, many machine learning models wouldn't work as expected, like k-nearest neighbors or linear regression, which rely on the data being similar and independent.

Statement 2: In 2017, COCO models were usually pretrained on ImageNet. Wait, COCO refers to the Common Objects in Context dataset, which is a large dataset used for object detection and segmentation tasks. ImageNet is another large dataset used for image classification. I'm not too sure about this one. I know that many models, especially in 2017, used ImageNet for pretraining because it's a large dataset with many labeled images. COCO models might use ImageNet for pretraining as well, but was that the usual practice in 2017? Alternatively, maybe they used other datasets like COCO itself or other sources. Wait, I think that a lot of models, especially in vision, would start with ImageNet because it's a standard for pretraining. So I'm leaning towards Statement 2 being True. But wait, maybe the answer says it's False? Or perhaps it's not stated, meaning the answer doesn't provide enough info. Alternatively, maybe COCO models in 2017 were more focused on their own dataset rather than ImageNet. I'm not entirely sure, but I'll go with the idea that they were pretrained on ImageNet, making Statement 2 True.

Wait, but looking back, maybe Statement 2 is False. Because COCO is for detection and segmentation, while ImageNet is for classification. I'm not sure if COCO models were typically pretrained on ImageNet or on COCO itself. Or perhaps they used other methods. Alternatively, maybe in 2017, models like Mask R-CNN, which are based on COCO, were often pretrained on ImageNet. Because the base network (like ResNet) is pretrained on ImageNet, and then fine-tuned on COCO. So in that case, Statement 2 would be True, because the models were pretrained on ImageNet before being used on COCO tasks. So I think Statement 2 is True.

Wait, but looking at the options, the answer choices for Statement 2 are either 'False' or 'Not stated.' Let me think again. The question says "COCO models were usually pretrained on ImageNet." If COCO models are trained on the COCO dataset, but perhaps their base models (like the backbone) are pretrained on ImageNet. So when they say "pretrained," does that refer to the entire model or just the initial part? If the models are fine-tuned on COCO after being pretrained on ImageNet, then the statement would be true. But if the statement is implying that COCO is used for pretraining, then it would be false. I think the correct understanding is that the models are pretrained on ImageNet before being adapted to COCO. So Statement 2 is True.

Wait, but looking at the options, the answer options are A to J, and I need to match the two statements. So if Statement 1 is True and Statement 2 is True, the answer would be H: True, True. But wait, I'm not 100% confident about Statement 2. Another angle: COCO is a dataset for object detection and segmentation, while ImageNet is for classification. Maybe in 2017, models like Faster R-CNN or Mask R-CNN were using ImageNet pretrained models. So yes, the statement would be True.

Wait, but I also remember that sometimes models are trained on a dataset without necessarily being called "pretrained" in that specific way. Maybe the question is trying to say that COCO models are not usually pretrained on ImageNet, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the statement is false because COCO is used for training, not ImageNet. But I think the standard approach was to use ImageNet for the base model. So I'll stick with Statement 2 being True.

But wait another thought: the term "COCO models" might refer to models specifically trained on COCO, perhaps without ImageNet pretraining. Or maybe they are referring to models that are trained on COCO from scratch, not using ImageNet. I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe in 2017, models were more likely to be pretrained on ImageNet, but perhaps for detection, they used other datasets. Maybe the statement is False because COCO models were not typically pretrained on ImageNet. Alternatively, perhaps it's not stated because the question doesn't provide enough info. But I think the correct answer is that Statement 2 is True because models often used ImageNet for pretraining before being applied to COCO tasks.

Wait, but the options don't have H (True, True) as the correct answer? Let me see the options again. The options are:

A: True, False

B: False, Not stated

C: False, False

D: False, True

E: Not stated, False

F: True, Not stated

G: True, Not applicable

H: True, True

I: Not stated, True

J: Not stated, Not stated

If I think Statement 1 is True and Statement 2 is True, then the answer would be H. But if I'm uncertain about Statement 2, perhaps it's better to check again.

Wait, I'm recalling that in 2017, models like ResNet were pretrained on ImageNet, and then used as backbones for COCO models. So when they say COCO models were usually pretrained on ImageNet, that's accurate because their base models are. So Statement 2 is True.

Therefore, the answer would be H: True, True.

Wait, but I'm now second-guessing because maybe the question is about the specific dataset used for pretraining the entire model, not just the backbone. If the model is fine-tuned on COCO, perhaps the statement is False because the model's initial training (pretraining) was on ImageNet, but the COCO models themselves use that as a base.

Alternatively, perhaps the statement is True because the models were pretrained on ImageNet before being used for COCO tasks. So I'll stick with H.

The first statement is true because traditional machine learning relies on the i.i.d. assumption. The second statement is true because COCO models often used ImageNet for pretraining in 2017.
