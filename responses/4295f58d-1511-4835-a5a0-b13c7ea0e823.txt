Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the resistance of a conductor. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my formulas, but I'll give it a shot.

The problem says: The resistance of a conductor with diameter d and length l is R ohms. If the diameter is halved and the length is doubled, what's the new resistance?

Hmm, I remember that resistance in a conductor depends on its length, cross-sectional area, and the material's resistivity. Oh right, the formula is R = ρ * (l)/(A), where ρ is the resistivity, l is the length, and A is the cross-sectional area.

Wait, so the cross-sectional area is related to the diameter. Since the diameter is halved, the radius is also halved. The area A of a circle is πr². So if the radius becomes half, the area would be π*(d/2)², where d is the original diameter. No, wait, original diameter is d, so original radius is d/2. If the new diameter is d/2, then the new radius is (d/2)/2 = d/4. So the new area A' would be π*(d/4)² = π*(d²/16) = (πd²/4) * (1/4) = (original area A) * 1/4. Wait, because original area A = π*(d/2)² = πd²/4. So yes, the new area is A' = A/4.

So the original resistance is R = ρ * l / A. Now, the new length is doubled, so l' = 2l. The new diameter is d/2, so the new area A' is (A)/4, as I figured. So plugging into the formula, new resistance R' = ρ * (2l) / (A/4) = ρ * 2l * 4/A = ρ * 8l/A. But wait, the original R was ρ*l/A = R. So R' = 8*(ρ*l/A) = 8R. Oh wait, that can't be right because I'm getting R' as 8R, which is option G. But wait, let me double-check.

Wait, I think I made a mistake in calculating the area change. Let me go through it again. The original diameter is d, so radius r = d/2. Area A = πr² = π (d/2)² = πd²/4. When the diameter is halved, new diameter is d/2, so new radius is r' = (d/2)/2 = d/4. So new area A' = π (d/4)² = π d²/16. So A' is (πd²/16) compared to the original A = πd²/4. So A' = A/4. That part seems correct.

So new length is 2l. So substituting into R' = ρ * (2l) / (A/4) = ρ * (2l * 4)/A = ρ * 8l/A. And since R = ρl/A, then R' = 8R. So the resistance increases by a factor of 8, making the new resistance 8R ohms. Looking at the options, option G is 8R Ω.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when you change the dimensions, especially diameter, it's easy to mix up whether it's area that's changing or just something else. Let me think again. If the diameter is halved, the radius is halved, so area becomes (r')² = (r/2)² = r²/4. So area is a quarter of the original. So the cross-sectional area is A/4.

So when you have a smaller area, the resistance increases because the same current would experience more opposition. Also, the length is doubled, which also increases resistance. So both factors are making the resistance go up. So the initial R is based on l and A. Changing l to 2l and A to A/4, so R' = (R) * (2l/l) * (A / (A/4)) ) = R * 2 *4 = 8R. Yep, that makes sense.

Wait, another way to think about it: Resistance is inversely proportional to the cross-sectional area and directly proportional to the length. So if length doubles, resistance doubles. If the diameter is halved, the cross-sectional area becomes (1/2)^2 = 1/4 of the original, so resistance increases by a factor of 4. So overall, resistance becomes 2 *4 = 8 times original. So R' =8R. So the answer should be G: 8R Ω.

The resistance of a conductor is given by the formula \( R = \rho \frac{l}{A} \), where \( \rho \) is the resistivity, \( l \) is the length, and \( A \) is the cross-sectional area. When the diameter is halved, the radius is also halved, reducing the cross-sectional area \( A \) to \( \frac{A}{4} \) (since area is proportional to the square of the radius). Doubling the length \( l \) to \( 2l \) increases the resistance. Combining these effects, the new resistance becomes \( R' = \rho \frac{2l}{\frac{A}{4}} = 8R \).
