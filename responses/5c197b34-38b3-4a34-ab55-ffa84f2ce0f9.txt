Okay, so I have this question about the evolution of autotrophs from primitive heterotrophs. Let me try to think through this step by step. 

First, I remember that autotrophs are organisms that can produce their own food using inorganic substances, usually through photosynthesis or chemosynthesis. Heterotrophs, on the other hand, get their food from organic sourcesâ€”like plants eating other organisms or getting nutrients from the environment.

The question is asking about the current theory on how autotrophs evolved from heterotrophs. I think the main idea here is about the origin of autotrophic organisms. From what I've studied before, the early Earth had a lot of carbon dioxide and other gases, but not much oxygen. The first life forms were probably heterotrophs because they could break down existing organic molecules for energy.

Then, at some point, some organisms evolved into autotrophs. I recall something about the Great Oxygenation Event, which was when photosynthetic organisms started releasing oxygen into the atmosphere. But wait, when did autotrophs first appear? I think the first autotrophs might have been something like cyanobacteria, which are photosynthetic. 

So, how did these autotrophs come from heterotrophs? There's a theory that some heterotrophic bacteria developed the ability to perform photosynthesis. Maybe they acquired the necessary genes through mutation or by engulfing photosynthetic bacteria, which then became chloroplasts. That's the endosymbiotic theory, right? So the heterotrophs engulfed the photosynthetic bacteria, and over time, those bacteria became dependent on their host, leading to the development of chloroplasts.

Looking at the options, let's go through them one by one. 

Option A says autotrophs and heterotrophs evolved simultaneously. I'm not sure if that's the case; I think autotrophs evolved from heterotrophs, so they didn't start at the same time.

Option B suggests a single catastrophic event triggered the evolution. I don't recall the theory pointing to a single event like that. It was more gradual changes, maybe.

Option C says autotrophs evolved from heterotrophs through symbiosis with bacteria. That sounds familiar because endosymbiosis is a key part of how chloroplasts developed. So this might be correct.

Option D says heterotrophs turned into autotrophs without mutations. That doesn't make sense because evolution usually involves mutations and natural selection.

Option E suggests autotrophs arose separately with no connection. That seems unlikely because autotrophs are derived from heterotrophs in the evolutionary tree.

Option F is about human intervention. No, evolution happens without humans guiding it.

Option G says it was random. While mutations are random, the evolution process itself is driven by selection, so this might not be the best fit.

Option H says environmental changes caused the evolution. That could be a factor, like when resources became scarce, but I think it's more about the acquisition of new traits through symbiosis.

Option I mentions overabundance of nutrients leading to autotrophs. If there was plenty of organic material, heterotrophs might have had no need to change, so this seems contradictory.

Option J talks about successive gene mutations. That's possible, but the endosymbiosis theory explains it through the acquisition of other organisms, not just mutations.

So, putting it together, the most plausible option is C: Autotrophs evolved from heterotrophs through the acquisition of symbiotic bacteria. This aligns with the endosymbiotic theory where heterotrophic cells engulfed photosynthetic bacteria, leading to the development of chloroplasts and thus autotrophic capabilities.

The evolution of autotrophs from heterotrophs is thought to have occurred through the acquisition of symbiotic bacteria, particularly in the case of photosynthesis. This process, supported by the endosymbiotic theory, explains how heterotrophic organisms could develop autotrophic abilities by engulfing photosynthetic bacteria, leading to the formation of organelles like chloroplasts. 

Answer: C
