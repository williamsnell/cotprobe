Okay, so I have this question about changes in attitudes toward premarital and extramarital sex over the past few decades. I need to choose the correct option from A to J.

First, I should understand the question. It's asking about the trend in attitudes towards two specific sexual behaviors: premarital sex (sex before marriage) and extramarital sex (sex outside of marriage, which is often considered cheating). The options describe how each attitude has changed—either becoming more permissive, less permissive, more accepting, less accepting, or remaining constant.

I remember that in recent decades, societal views on sex have become more liberal in many places. So, for premarital sex, I think people are more accepting now than in the past. In the past, premarital sex was often stigmatized, but nowadays it's more common and socially accepted. So the first blank should be "become more permissive" or "become more accepting." Both seem similar, but "permissive" might be the better term here.

Now, for extramarital sex, the situation is a bit trickier. Traditionally, extramarital sex has been seen as a serious issue, often leading to divorce or other consequences. However, I'm not sure if attitudes have become more or less accepting. I think that while some people might still hold strong opinions against it, there's a shift towards more open relationships and perhaps more acceptance in some contexts. But I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, maybe people are less accepting because cheating is still considered a betrayal, so maybe the trend is towards less accepting. Wait, that doesn't sound right. Or perhaps it's the opposite—maybe because of things like more open marriages or polyamory, extramarital sex is becoming more accepted? Or is it becoming less accepted because of increased awareness of its emotional impact?

Wait, I'm confusing myself. Let me think again. Premarital sex is more accepted now, so the first part is definitely "become more permissive." Now, for extramarital sex, I think that while some people are more open, the general societal attitude might still be against it. However, I've heard that some studies show a slight increase in acceptance, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's remained constant. No, I think that's not the case.

Wait, another angle: in the past, premarital sex was taboo, so becoming more permissive makes sense. For extramarital sex, maybe it's become less accepted because of the rise of stricter moral codes or more awareness of the harm it can cause. Or perhaps it's the opposite—maybe people are more accepting because of things like open marriages. Hmm.

I think that over the past few decades, premarital sex has become more accepted, but extramarital sex has actually become less accepted. Why? Because even though some people might engage in it, the social norms against it have become stronger. Or maybe the opposite—maybe people are more permissive about it as well. I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: looking at the options. Option I is both becoming more permissive, which seems too broad. Option D says both become more permissive and less accepting, which doesn't make sense because they're opposites. Option H is less accepting for premarital, which I don't think is correct. Option I is both more permissive, but I'm not sure about extramarital.

Alternatively, perhaps extramarital sex has become less accepted. So the first part is more permissive, the second less accepting. That would make the answer I think is D: become more permissive; become less accepting. Wait, no, looking at the options, D says "become more more permissive"—that's a typo, but the correct option would be something like more permissive and less accepting.

Wait, looking back at the options:

Option D: become more more permissive; become less accepting. That seems like a typo, but maybe it's a typo and it's meant to be "more permissive; less accepting." If that's the case, then D would be the correct answer. Alternatively, maybe the correct option is I, where both become more permissive, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check. Premarital sex has definitely become more accepted. As for extramarital, I'm not sure. Maybe it's become less accepted because of increased awareness of its negative impact on relationships, so people are less tolerant. So the answer would be D, but D has a typo. Alternatively, looking for an option where premarital is more permissive and extramarital is less accepting.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me look at the options again.

Option D: become more more permissive; become less accepting. Hmm, that seems like a typo, but perhaps it's intended to mean "more permissive; less accepting." If that's the case, then D would be the answer. But if the options are correct as written, then maybe D is not the right choice.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. I think the correct answer is that premarital sex has become more permissive, and extramarital sex has become less accepted. So looking at the options, the correct one would be D, assuming the typo. Alternatively, if there's an option where premarital is more permissive and extramarital is less accepting, that's the one.

Wait, looking again:

Option D: become more more permissive; become less accepting.

Option H: become less accepting; become more permissive.

Option I: become more permissive; become more accepting.

Option E: become less permissive; become more accepting.

So, if I think premarital is more permissive, and extramarital is less accepting, then the correct option would be D, but D has a typo. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D, assuming it's a typo, or maybe the intended option is not listed correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong about extramarital sex. Maybe it's become more permissive as well. Then the answer would be I. But I'm not sure. I think that extramarital sex is still generally less accepted, so the correct answer would be D, assuming the typo is a mistake and it's meant to say "more permissive; less accepting."

The correct answer is D: become more permissive; become less accepting. This assumes a typo in the option, where "more more permissive" is intended to mean "more permissive." Over the past decades, premarital sex has become more accepted (more permissive), while extramarital sex has seen a decline in acceptance (less accepting).

Answer: D
