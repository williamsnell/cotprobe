Question:

How can crosses involving strains of highly inbred mice be used to determine a genetic basis for transplant incompatibility?

Options:

A: Transplant rejection is determined by the size difference between donor and recipient.
B: Transplant acceptance is solely based on the health of the recipient.
C: Transplant rejection (or acceptance) has a genetic basis.
D: Transplant success is solely determined by environmental factors.
E: Transplant outcomes can be predicted by the coat color of the mice.
F: Transplant compatibility is dependent on the age of the mice.
G: Transplant incompatibility is determined by the donor's blood type.
H: Transplant incompatibility is due to behavioral traits of the recipient.
I: Transplant acceptance is related to the duration of the daylight exposure of the mice.
J: Transplant rejection is not related to genetics.

Okay, so I have this question about using crosses involving highly inbred mice to determine a genetic basis for transplant incompatibility. Hmm, I remember that inbred strains have very similar genes, so their offspring are genetically almost identical. But why would we use crosses between different inbred strains?

Wait, when you cross two inbred strains, their offspring will be hybrids, right? And these hybrids might show traits that are different from either parent. Transplant incompatibility is probably related to the immune system. Oh, right, because the immune system can recognize foreign tissues. So if donor and recipient are genetically different, the recipient's immune system might reject the transplant.

If mice are inbred, they have a very uniform genotype. So if you take an organ from one inbred strain and transplant it into another inbred strain that's genetically different, the recipient's immune system might reject it. But how does that help determine the genetic basis?

Ah, crosses between inbred strains can create offspring with specific genetic variations. By observing whether the transplanted tissue is accepted or rejected in these crosses, we can see if certain genes are responsible for the incompatibility. For example, if a particular gene is involved in immune recognition, then the presence or absence of that gene in the donor and recipient could influence transplant success.

So the question is about using these crosses to find a genetic basis. The options are A to J. Let's look at them:

A: Size difference. No, that's more about physical fit, not genetics.
B: Health of recipient. No, the question is about genetic basis, not health.
C: Rejection/acceptance has a genetic basis. That sounds right because if it's genetic, crosses would show variation.
D: Environment only. No, question is about genetics.
E: Coat color. Maybe relates to some genes, but not the main factor in transplant.
F: Age. Doesn't directly relate to genetics here.
G: Blood type. Blood types can matter, but the broader point is about genetics in general.
H: Behavioral traits. Unrelated to immune response.
I: Daylight exposure. Environment again.
J: Not related. Opposite of what we think.

So the correct answer should be C: Transplant rejection (or acceptance) has a genetic basis. Because using inbred mice and their crosses allows us to see if genetic factors determine whether a transplant is accepted or rejected.

The use of crosses involving highly inbred mice allows researchers to study the genetic basis of transplant incompatibility by observing whether transplanted tissues are accepted or rejected in hybrids. This helps identify specific genes that influence immune recognition and compatibility.
