Okay, so I've got this question about what happens when food is exposed to gamma radiation. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that gamma radiation is a type of ionizing radiation. I think it's used in various applications, like sterilization or food preservation. Oh right, gamma rays are often used to kill bacteria in food, extending its shelf life. So, maybe that's relevant here.

Looking at the options, let's go through them one by one. Option A says the food should be avoided. I don't think that's right because if it's used for preservation, it's probably safe. But wait, is there a risk? I don't recall food becoming unsafe to eat just because it's been irradiated, but I'm not sure.

Option B suggests the food becomes slightly radioactive. That rings a bell. Wait, does irradiation make the food radioactive? I think no, because gamma radiation is just energy, not adding radioactive material. So the food doesn't become radioactive itself. So B might be incorrect.

Option C says it becomes carcinogenic. I've heard conflicting things about this. Some people worry that irradiation could cause cancer, but I think scientific consensus says it's safe. Maybe the World Health Organization or FDA approves it. So C could be wrong.

Option D, becomes inedible. No, because the purpose of irradiation is to make food last longer without going bad, so it's still edible. So D is probably not right.

Option E, will glow in the dark. I don't think so. Only some materials glow under radiation, and food isn't one of them. So E is likely wrong.

Option F, will spoil faster. That doesn't make sense. Gamma irradiation is used to slow spoilage by killing bacteria, so F is incorrect.

Option G, doesn’t become radioactive. This seems correct because the process doesn't introduce radioactive substances into the food. The food isn't a radioactive source; it's just exposed to the radiation, which then decays and doesn't remain in the food.

Option H, will lose all nutritional value. I don't think so. Some nutrients might degrade a bit, but not all. Most foods retain their nutritional value after irradiation. So H is probably wrong.

Option I, will taste differently. I'm not sure. I think some people might notice a slight change in taste, but it's generally considered minimal. It's possible, but I'm not certain if it's a guaranteed outcome.

Option J, becomes toxic. No, because the radiation doesn't make the food toxic. It's meant to preserve it, so J is incorrect.

So, considering all options, the correct answer should be G: doesn’t become radioactive. Because gamma radiation is used for treatment, not to make the food radioactive. The food isn't a radioactive material; it's just exposed to the radiation, which doesn't make it radioactive itself.

The correct answer is G: doesn’t become radioactive. Gamma radiation is used to treat food without making it radioactive. 

Answer: G
