Question:

Four days after undergoing open reduction and internal fixation of a fracture of the right femur sustained in a motor vehicle collision, a 47-year-old man continues to have agitation and confusion despite treatment with haloperidol. He has mild hypertension. Other medications include acetaminophen, atenolol, and prophylactic subcutaneous heparin. His temperature is 37.2°C (99°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 24/min, and blood pressure is 168/98 mm Hg. During the examination, he is uncooperative and refuses to answer questions. Neurologic examination shows tremulousness and no focal findings. He is oriented to person but not to place or time. A CT scan of the head shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely cause of these findings?

Options:

A: Adverse effect of medication
B: Alcohol withdrawal
C: Fat emboli
D: Sepsis

Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is about a 47-year-old man who had a femur fracture and underwent surgery. Now, four days later, he's agitated and confused despite haloperidol. Let's break down the information.

So, his symptoms include agitation, confusion, hypertension, and he's uncooperative. He's oriented only to person, not place or time. His vitals are slightly elevated: temp 37.2, pulse 98, resps 24, BP 168/98. The CT scan of the head is normal.

He's on several medications: acetaminophen, atenolol, and heparin. Haloperidol is for the agitation, but it's not working. He has tremulousness on exam, but no focal findings.

Let's look at the options:

A: Adverse effect of medication. He's on haloperidol, which is an antipsychotic. It can cause akathisia or tardive dyskinesia, but in this case, the symptoms are confusion and agitation. Could it be an adverse effect? Maybe, but let's not jump to that yet.

B: Alcohol withdrawal. He has hypertension, tremors, agitation, confusion. That fits the classic delirium tremens. But does the history mention alcohol use? The question doesn't state that he's an alcoholic or has a history of drinking. So maybe less likely unless it's a red herring.

C: Fat emboli. Fat embolism syndrome can occur after fractures, especially femur. Symptoms include petechiae, high BP, fever, confusion. But usually, there are other signs like pulmonary symptoms or skin changes. He had a CT head which is normal, but a CT chest might show pulmonary issues. Not sure, but possible.

D: Sepsis. Signs of sepsis include fever, tachycardia, tachypnea, and sometimes confusion. His BP is high, which could be due to sepsis-induced hypoperfusion. But he has a normal CT head, and the fracture was four days ago. Sepsis usually presents with a higher fever and more systemic symptoms, maybe leukocytosis. But not sure if it's the most likely.

Other possibilities: Could it be a drug-induced delirium? Haloperidol can cause confusion, but he's on it for that. Alternatively, maybe the acetaminophen is an issue, but acetaminophen doesn't typically cause confusion.

Wait, he's on atenolol, which is a beta-blocker. Could that be contributing to confusion? Beta-blockers can sometimes cause dizziness or confusion, especially if not tolerated. But he's been on it for a while, so maybe not the main issue.

Another thought: post-traumatic issues. After major surgery, especially with a fracture, patients can develop delirium. Contributing factors include pain, immobility, sleep deprivation, and medications. He's on pain meds? Wait, the medications listed are acetaminophen, atenolol, heparin, and haloperidol. No narcotics mentioned. Maybe he's in pain but not given strong painkillers, but that's speculative.

Wait, but the symptoms started four days after surgery. Fat embolism usually presents earlier, like within a few days, which fits. Symptoms include confusion, fever, tachycardia, and hypertension. Also, fat embolism can cause pulmonary issues, but the CT head is normal. Maybe a chest X-ray would show pulmonary stuff, but it's not mentioned.

Sepsis would have more systemic signs, maybe more leukocytosis, but without knowing his WBC count, it's hard. But the question says the CT head is normal, which doesn't rule out sepsis.

Alternatively, could it be an adverse effect from the atenolol? But atenolol typically causes bradycardia, not tachycardia. His pulse is 98, which is a bit high, but not too bad.

Back to alcohol withdrawal. If he's a heavy drinker and hasn't had access to alcohol, the withdrawal symptoms could include tremors, anxiety, confusion, and hypertension. But since the question doesn't mention a history of alcohol use, it's less likely unless it's a trick.

Wait, the options are A to J, but the choices given are A to D. So, looking back, the most likely options are A, B, C, D.

Considering the facts, the patient is agitated, confused, with normal CT head. Possible causes: sepsis, fat emboli, alcohol withdrawal, or medication adverse effect.

The patient's BP is 168/98, which is significantly high. In fat embolism, you can have high BP. In sepsis, you can also have high BP as part of systemic response.

But another point: he's on prophylactic heparin, which is to prevent DVT. If he had a fat embolism, that could cause pulmonary issues, but his chest wasn't mentioned. Alternatively, sepsis could be from an infection post-surgery.

Wait, but four days post-op, an infection could develop. If there's an infection, that would lead to sepsis, which could explain the confusion, fever, etc. But without knowing if he has a source of infection, like a surgical site infection, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, could it be a reaction to haloperidol? He's on it for agitation, but it's not working, and maybe causing more confusion. Haloperidol can cause sedation, but also sometimes extrapyramidal symptoms. But the patient is agitated, so maybe the dose is too low. But the question says he's on treatment with haloperidol, so maybe it's not an adverse effect but the condition itself.

Another angle: the patient's mental status. He's oriented to person but not place or time, which suggests a delirium. Delirium can be caused by many things: metabolic issues, infections, medications, withdrawal, etc.

Given that, let's think about the options again. The presence of tremulousness points towards alcohol withdrawal or perhaps a medication effect (like from haloperidol). But in alcohol withdrawal, you often see more pronounced tremors, and the patient might have a history of drinking.

Alternatively, fat embolism can cause confusion and other symptoms. But without more pulmonary signs, it's less likely.

Sepsis is a strong possibility because it can cause confusion, fever, tachycardia, and hypertension. Plus, after surgery, especially with internal fixation, there's a risk of infection leading to sepsis.

Wait, but the patient's BP is quite high. In sepsis, you can have a hyperdynamic response with high cardiac output, but sometimes it can be more of a hypotensive response. But in this case, BP is high, so maybe more in line with an infection causing a systemic response.

Alternatively, could it be a hypertensive crisis leading to encephalopathy? That can cause confusion, but usually with very high BP and neurological symptoms. His BP is 168/98, which is stage 2 hypertension, but not crisis levels (which are much higher, like >180/120). So maybe less likely.

Putting it all together, the most likely causes are either sepsis or alcohol withdrawal. But without a history of alcohol use, it's hard to choose. Alternatively, the answer might be C: fat emboli.

Wait, another thought: the patient is on heparin. Could that be causing some issue? Heparin can cause heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, but that's usually after days to weeks. Not sure if that's relevant here.

Alternatively, could the patient have developed a DVT, leading to pulmonary embolism? That would cause confusion from hypoxia, but again, the CT head is normal, and no chest symptoms are mentioned.

Hmm, this is tricky. Let me think again.

The key factors: agitation, confusion, normal CT head, mild hypertension, tremors, no focal neuro signs.

Options are A (medication adverse effect), B (alcohol withdrawal), C (fat emboli), D (sepsis).

If it's medication-related, which one? Haloperidol can cause confusion, but if he's on it for agitation and it's not working, maybe it's not the cause. Alternatively, atenolol could be contributing, but I don't think so.

Alcohol withdrawal would require a history, which isn't given. But maybe the question expects that as a possibility.

Fat emboli: possible, but often presents with more specific signs like petechiae, but not always.

Sepsis: fits the systemic symptoms, but without a known source, it's harder to diagnose.

Wait, the patient's BP is 168/98, which is significantly high. Could this be due to a hypertensive emergency causing encephalopathy? But that usually presents with more severe symptoms and higher BP.

Alternatively, the increased BP could be a response to pain or another underlying issue.

Another angle: the patient has mild hypertension, but now it's significantly elevated. Could this be due to a secondary cause like hyperthyroidism or something else? But that's not mentioned.

Wait, maybe the patient is in pain but not expressing it. Severe pain can cause confusion and agitation. But he's on acetaminophen, which is not strong for severe pain. If he's in pain, that could be contributing, but the question doesn't mention that.

Alternatively, could the patient be developing a bedsore or other complications leading to sepsis? But that's speculative.

Given all this, I think the most likely answer is D: Sepsis. Because it explains the fever, tachycardia, tachypnea, confusion, and hypertension. The CT head being normal doesn't rule it out because the infection could be elsewhere, like in the lungs or at the surgical site.

But wait, another thought: the patient's mental status changes. If it's post-traumatic, could it be a metabolic issue like hypoxia or something else? But again, without more info, sepsis seems plausible.

Alternatively, could it be a reaction to the internal fixation hardware? I don't think so; infections usually take longer to develop.

I'm still a bit torn between C and D. But considering the systemic symptoms and the possibility of an infection post-surgery, I think D: Sepsis is the most likely answer.

The patient is a 47-year-old man who, four days after undergoing open reduction and internal fixation for a right femur fracture, presents with agitation, confusion, and mild hypertension. Despite treatment with haloperidol, his symptoms persist. Other medications include acetaminophen, atenolol, and prophylactic heparin. Vital signs show a temperature of 37.2°C, pulse 98/min, respirations 24/min, and blood pressure 168/98 mm Hg. He is uncooperative, oriented only to person, and exhibits tremulousness without focal neurologic findings. A CT scan of the head is normal.

**Analysis of Options:**

- **A: Adverse effect of medication**  
  Haloperidol can cause confusion and agitation, but the patient is already being treated with it, and the symptoms persist. Atenolol (a beta-blocker) and acetaminophen are less likely to cause these symptoms. While medication effects are possible, they are not the most likely cause.

- **B: Alcohol withdrawal**  
  Alcohol withdrawal can present with agitation, confusion, tremors, and hypertension. However, the patient’s history does not mention alcohol use, making this less likely unless it is a red herring.

- **C: Fat emboli**  
  Fat embolism syndrome can occur after femur fractures and present with confusion, fever, tachycardia, and hypertension. However, it often presents with additional signs like petechiae or pulmonary symptoms, which are not mentioned. The normal CT head does not fully rule out this possibility but makes it less likely.

- **D: Sepsis**  
  Sepsis can cause fever, tachycardia, tachypnea, confusion, and hypertension. The patient’s symptoms align with sepsis, especially given the risk of infection post-surgery. The normal CT head does not rule out sepsis, as the infection could be elsewhere (e.g., lungs or surgical site). This is the most likely diagnosis given the systemic nature of the symptoms and the post-operative context.

**Conclusion:**  
The most likely cause of the patient’s findings is **sepsis**, as it explains the systemic symptoms and fits the post-operative context.
