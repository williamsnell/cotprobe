Question:

Margaret Denault recently rented a truck to drive 516 miles in days and 17 hours, using 54 gallons of gasoline. The rental company charged her $32 per day, $.22 per mile, and $.445 per gal-lon of gas. Extra hours were charged $2.75 per hour. Find the total cost of the rental.

Options:

A: $308.25
B: $142.75
C: $199.99
D: $225.85
E: $113.52
F: $162.47
G: $346.10
H: $24.03
I: $253.40
J: $280.30

Okay, so I need to figure out the total cost Margaret Denault paid for renting the truck. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, I'll list out all the given information:

- She drove 516 miles.
- The time taken was 516 miles in days and 17 hours. Wait, that wording seems a bit unclear. Oh, maybe it's 5 days and 17 hours? Because 516 miles in days and hours doesn't make much sense. I think that's the correct interpretation. So, the time is 5 days and 17 hours.

The charges are as follows:

- $32 per day.
- $0.22 per mile.
- $0.445 per gallon of gas.
- Extra hours are charged at $2.75 per hour.

She used 54 gallons of gasoline.

So, the total cost will be the sum of the daily rate, the mileage rate, the gas cost, and any extra hours beyond the included time.

Wait, but the problem doesn't mention any included hours. It just says extra hours are charged. So, perhaps all the hours beyond the daily rate are extra. Or maybe the daily rate includes a certain number of hours, but since it's not specified, I think we can assume that the 5 days include 5 full days, and the 17 hours are extra. Because each day is typically 24 hours, but in this case, she's being charged for 17 extra hours beyond the 5 days.

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Let me think again. If she rented the truck for 5 days, that's 5 * 24 = 120 hours. She used 5 days and 17 hours, which is 120 +17=137 hours. But the charge is $32 per day, and extra hours are $2.75 per hour. So, the extra hours beyond the 5 days would be 17 hours. So, she's charged for 5 days plus 17 extra hours.

Alternatively, maybe the daily rate includes a certain number of hours, but since it's not specified, perhaps the 17 hours are extra beyond the 5 days. So, I think the total cost will be calculated as:

Total cost = (Number of days * daily rate) + (Number of extra hours * hourly rate) + (Mileage cost) + (Gas cost)

Let me calculate each part.

First, number of days: 5 days. So, 5 * $32 = $160.

Next, extra hours: 17 hours. So, 17 * $2.75. Let's compute that: 17 * 2.75.

17 * 2 = 34, 17 * 0.75 = 12.75. So, total is 34 +12.75 = $46.75.

Mileage cost: 516 miles * $0.22 per mile.

516 * 0.22. Let's compute that. 500 *0.22=110, 16*0.22=3.52. So, total is 110 +3.52= $113.52.

Gas cost: 54 gallons * $0.445 per gallon.

54 * 0.445. Let me compute that. 50 *0.445=22.25, and 4*0.445=1.78. So total is 22.25 +1.78= $24.03.

Now, sum all these up:

Daily rate: $160
Extra hours: $46.75
Mileage: $113.52
Gas: $24.03

Total = 160 +46.75 = 206.75
206.75 + 113.52 = 320.27
320.27 +24.03 = 344.30

Hmm, but that's not one of the options. The options are A:308.25, B:142.75, C:199.99, D:225.85, E:113.52, F:162.47, G:346.10, H:24.03, I:253.40, J:280.30.

Wait, I got $344.30, but option G is $346.10. Close but not exact. Did I make a calculation error?

Let me double-check each step.

Daily rate: 5 *32=160. Correct.

Extra hours:17 *2.75. Let me compute 17 *2.75.

2.75 *10=27.5, 2.75*7=19.25. So 27.5+19.25=46.75. Correct.

Mileage:516 *0.22.

516 *0.2=103.2, 516 *0.02=10.32. Total 113.52. Correct.

Gas:54 *0.445.

Let me compute 54 *0.4 =21.6, 54 *0.04=2.16, 54 *0.005=0.27. So total is 21.6 +2.16=23.76 +0.27=24.03. Correct.

Now, adding: 160 +46.75=206.75. Then +113.52=320.27. Then +24.03=344.30. Hmm.

But the options don't have 344.30. The closest is G:346.10.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the extra hours. Let me check the time again.

Wait, the problem says she drove 516 miles in days and 17 hours. So, maybe the total time is 5 days and 17 hours. But if the daily rate is per day, regardless of hours, then perhaps the 17 hours are extra beyond the 5 days.

Alternatively, maybe the 5 days include 5 full days, and the 17 hours are extra. So, I think I did that correctly. So 17 *2.75=46.75.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the 5 days and 17 hours is the total time taken, but maybe the daily rate includes a certain number of hours, like 24 hours per day. So, she's charged for 5 days, which is 5*24=120 hours, and then 17 more hours, so 137 total hours. But that's the same as 5 days plus 17 extra hours. So my calculation should be correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the 5 days and 17 hours is the time she rented the truck, but perhaps she only needed 5 days and 17 hours, so no extra hours beyond that. Wait, but the way the problem is worded is that she rented the truck to drive 516 miles in days and 17 hours. So, perhaps the rental period is 5 days and 17 hours, which would be 5 days plus 17 hours. So, the cost would be 5 days plus 17 hours.

Alternatively, perhaps the 5 days and 17 hours is the total time she used the truck, and the daily rate is per full day. So, if she uses part of a day, it's still a full day charge. But in this case, she used 5 full days and 17 extra hours beyond that. So, I think my initial approach is correct.

Wait, but the total I got is $344.30, which is not an option. The closest is G:346.10. Let me check if I made a calculation error in any part.

Let me recalculate the gas cost: 54 *0.445.

Compute 54 *0.4 =21.6

54 *0.04=2.16

54 *0.005=0.27

So, 21.6 +2.16=23.76 +0.27=24.03. Correct.

Mileage:516 *0.22=113.52. Correct.

Extra hours:17 *2.75=46.75. Correct.

Daily rate:5*32=160.

So, 160+46.75=206.75

206.75+113.52=320.27

320.27+24.03=344.30.

Hmm, perhaps the problem expects that the 17 hours are included in the daily rate. Wait, but the problem says "extra hours were charged $2.75 per hour." So, perhaps the daily rate includes a certain number of hours, say 24, and any hours beyond that are extra. But since she only used 17 hours beyond the 5 days, which is less than a full day, perhaps she's charged for 5 days plus 17 extra hours. So, my calculation should be correct.

Wait, maybe the problem is that the 5 days and 17 hours is the total time, but perhaps the daily rate is for 24 hours, so she's charged for 5 days, and the 17 hours are extra. So, that's what I did.

But the total I got isn't an option. Let me check the options again. The options are A:308.25, B:142.75, C:199.99, D:225.85, E:113.52, F:162.47, G:346.10, H:24.03, I:253.40, J:280.30.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the extra hours calculation. Let me compute 17 *2.75 again.

2.75 *17:

2 *17=34

0.75 *17=12.75

34+12.75=46.75. Correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the 5 days and 17 hours is the total time, and the daily rate includes 24 hours, so the extra hours are 17 beyond the 5 days, but perhaps the 17 hours are part of the daily rate. Wait, that can't be because she's charged for 5 days, which is 5*24=120 hours. She used 5 days and 17 hours, which is 137 hours. So, 137 hours total.

But the daily rate is for each day, regardless of how many hours she uses in that day. So, she's charged for 5 days, and the 17 hours beyond that are extra. So, 17 *2.75=46.75.

Alternatively, perhaps the 17 hours are included in the daily rate. Wait, but the problem says extra hours are charged, so I think my initial approach is correct.

Wait, maybe the problem is that the 5 days and 17 hours is the total time, and the daily rate is for each day, so she's charged for 5 days, and the 17 hours are extra. So, 5*32=160, 17*2.75=46.75, mileage 113.52, gas 24.03. Total 344.30.

But since that's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the time. Maybe the time is 5 days and 17 hours, but the daily rate includes 24 hours, so she's charged for 5 days, and the 17 hours beyond that are extra. So, same as before.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the total time is 5 days and 17 hours, which is 5*24 +17=137 hours. But perhaps the daily rate is per day, and the extra hours are per hour beyond the daily rate. So, perhaps the 5 days include 5*24=120 hours, and the 17 hours are extra, so 17*2.75=46.75.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the 5 days and 17 hours is the total time, but the daily rate is per day, and any fraction of a day is charged as a full day. So, 5 days and 17 hours would be 5 days plus a partial day. But 17 hours is more than half a day (12 hours), so perhaps she's charged for 6 days. But that would make the daily rate 6*32=192, which would significantly increase the cost. Let me see what that would do.

Daily rate:6*32=192

Extra hours:17 hours beyond 6 days? No, because 6 days would be 6*24=144 hours, but she only used 137 hours, so perhaps no extra hours beyond 6 days. Wait, that would mean she's charged for 6 days, but she only used 137 hours, which is less than 6 days (144 hours). So that might not be the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the daily rate is per day, and any partial day is charged as a full day. So, 5 days and 17 hours would be 5 full days plus one more day for the 17 hours, totaling 6 days. So, 6*32=192.

Then, extra hours: but since she's charged for 6 days, which is 6*24=144 hours, and she only used 137, so no extra hours beyond that. So, extra hours would be 0.

In that case, total cost would be:

Daily:6*32=192

Mileage:516*0.22=113.52

Gas:54*0.445=24.03

Total:192+113.52=305.52 +24.03=329.55.

Still not matching any option. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the 5 days and 17 hours is the total time, and the daily rate is for 24 hours, so she's charged for 5 days, and the 17 hours are extra. So, same as before.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the 5 days and 17 hours is the total time, but the extra hours are calculated differently. Maybe the daily rate includes a certain number of hours, say 8 hours, and any beyond that are extra. But the problem doesn't specify, so I think that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the 5 days and 17 hours is the total time, and the daily rate is per day, regardless of hours, so she's charged for 5 days, and the 17 hours are extra, so 17*2.75=46.75.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the 5 days and 17 hours is the total time, but the daily rate is for 8 hours, and any beyond that are extra. For example, if a day is considered 8 hours, then 5 days would be 5*8=40 hours, and 17 hours extra would be 17 hours beyond that, but that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the 5 days and 17 hours is the total time, and the daily rate is for 24 hours, so she's charged for 5 days, and the 17 hours are extra. So, same as before.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the 5 days and 17 hours is the total time, and the daily rate is for each full day, and any partial day is charged as a full day. So, 5 days and 17 hours would be 5 days plus a partial day, which would be charged as 6 days. So, 6*32=192.

Then, extra hours beyond the 6 days would be 17 hours beyond 6 days. Wait, no, because 6 days is 144 hours, and she only used 137 hours, so no extra hours beyond that. So, extra hours would be 0.

In that case, total cost would be:

Daily:6*32=192

Mileage:113.52

Gas:24.03

Total:192+113.52=305.52 +24.03=329.55.

Still not matching any option.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the problem is that the 5 days and 17 hours is the total time, and the daily rate is for each day, regardless of how many hours she uses. So, she's charged for 5 days, and the 17 hours are extra, so 17*2.75=46.75.

If I add all that up:160+46.75=206.75 +113.52=320.27 +24.03=344.30.

But that's not an option. The closest is G:346.10.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the mileage calculation.

Let me compute 516 *0.22 again.

516 *0.2=103.2

516 *0.02=10.32

Total:103.2+10.32=113.52. Correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the 5 days and 17 hours is the total time, but the daily rate is for each day, and the extra hours are calculated as the total hours beyond the days. So, 5 days is 5*24=120 hours, and she used 17 more hours, so 17*2.75=46.75.

So, same as before.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is that the 5 days and 17 hours is the total time, but the daily rate is for each day, and the extra hours are calculated as the total hours beyond the days. So, 5 days is 5*24=120 hours, and she used 17 more, so 17*2.75=46.75.

So, same as before.

Hmm, but the total is 344.30, which is not an option. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the daily rate. The daily rate is $32 per day, and she rented it for 5 days. So, 5*32=160. Correct.

Wait, maybe I should check if the problem is in the way the time is presented. The problem says she drove 516 miles in days and 17 hours. Maybe it's 5 days and 17 hours, but perhaps the 17 hours are part of the daily rate. Wait, but the problem says extra hours are charged, so I think the 17 hours are extra beyond the 5 days.

To determine the total cost of the rental, we'll break down the expenses into four components: daily rate, extra hours, mileage, and gas cost.

1. **Daily Rate**:  
   She rented the truck for 5 days at $32 per day.  
   \( 5 \text{ days} \times \$32/\text{day} = \$160 \)

2. **Extra Hours**:  
   She used 17 extra hours at $2.75 per hour.  
   \( 17 \text{ hours} \times \$2.75/\text{hour} = \$46.75 \)

3. **Mileage Cost**:  
   She drove 516 miles at $0.22 per mile.  
   \( 516 \text{ miles} \times \$0.22/\text{mile} = \$113.52 \)

4. **Gas Cost**:  
   She used 54 gallons at $0.445 per gallon.  
   \( 54 \text{ gallons} \times \$0.445/\text{gallon} = \$24.03 \)

Adding all these costs together:  
\( \$160 + \$46.75 + \$113.52 + \$24.03 = \$344.30 \)

Since $344.30 isn't an option, the closest available is **G: $346.10**.

Answer: G
