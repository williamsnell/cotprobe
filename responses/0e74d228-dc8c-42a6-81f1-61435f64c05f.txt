Question:

A 44-year-old woman with a 10-year history of arthritis comes to the office because she has had increasing pain and stiffness in her hands, wrists, and knees during the past several months. She also has had increasing fatigue for the past month, along with a weight loss of 1.8 to 2.2 kg (4 to 5 lb). She has seen numerous physicians for her arthritis in the past and has tried various medications and devices, including copper bracelets from Mexico given to her by friends. Review of her medical records confirms that the initial diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis is correct. She says, "I had several drop attacks during the past 3 months." She characterizes these attacks as episodes of weakness and loss of feeling in her legs for several minutes. During one of these episodes, she became incontinent. She currently takes aspirin approximately four times daily and ibuprofen occasionally. Physical examination shows facial plethora and swollen and painful metacarpophalangeal and knee joints, bilaterally. There is moderate ulnar deviation of the fingers. The remainder of the examination discloses no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely cause of her "drop attacks?"

Options:

A: Side effect of the copper bracelets
B: Spinal stenosis
C: Reaction to aspirin or ibuprofen
D: Cardiac arrhythmia
E: Anxiety
F: Transient ischemic attack
G: Adrenal insufficiency
H: Hypoglycemia
I: Atlanto-axial instability

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the answer to this medical question. Let me read through the scenario again carefully.

The patient is a 44-year-old woman with a 10-year history of arthritis. She's been having increased pain and stiffness in her hands, wrists, and knees recently. She also has fatigue and weight loss. She's tried various treatments, including copper bracelets, which I think some people use for arthritis but I'm not sure if they have any medical basis.

Her medical records confirm the initial diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis, which makes sense because she's had joint issues for a while. She mentioned having several "drop attacks" over the past three months. These attacks are characterized by weakness and loss of feeling in her legs for a few minutes. During one episode, she became incontinent. So, these episodes seem to involve temporary loss of function in her lower extremities, possibly leading to inability to hold her bladder.

She's taking aspirin four times a day and occasional ibuprofen. The physical exam shows facial plethora, which I think means she looks flushed or has a ruddy complexion, maybe from inflammation. Her joints are swollen and painful, especially the metacarpophalangeal and knee joints, which are common in rheumatoid arthritis. The ulnar deviation of the fingers is also a classic sign of RA because the inflammation causes the fingers to deviate towards the little finger.

Now, the question is about the cause of her "drop attacks." The options are A through I. Let me go through each possible cause.

Option A: Side effect of copper bracelets. I don't think copper bracelets have any proven medical benefits, but I also don't recall any side effects that would cause drop attacks. Maybe if she's allergic, but that would probably cause skin reactions, not neurological symptoms.

Option B: Spinal stenosis. This is a narrowing of the spinal canal that can compress nerves, leading to pain and weakness, especially in the legs. But drop attacks, where she suddenly loses strength and feeling, might be more acute. Spinal stenosis usually presents with more chronic symptoms, like pain that worsens with activity and relief when sitting or bending forward. Also, incontinence could be a sign if it's related to nerve compression in the lower spine, but I'm not sure if that's the case here.

Option C: Reaction to aspirin or ibuprofen. Both are NSAIDs, and they can cause side effects like gastrointestinal issues or kidney problems. But could they cause neurological symptoms like weakness and incontinence? I'm not sure. Aspirin can cause Reye's syndrome in children, but that's rare. Maybe an allergic reaction could cause more systemic issues, but drop attacks seem specific.

Option D: Cardiac arrhythmia. An arrhythmia can cause dizziness or fainting, but drop attacks with weakness and incontinence seem more like a neurological issue. Unless it's a severe arrhythmia leading to reduced blood flow to the brain, but that's more like a TIA or stroke.

Option E: Anxiety. Anxiety can cause various physical symptoms, including shaking, palpitations, and sometimes even a sense of weakness. But incontinence during an anxiety attack? That seems less likely unless she's really panicking, but drop attacks with loss of feeling in legs... I'm not sure. Maybe a conversion disorder, but that's more psychological.

Option F: Transient ischemic attack (TIA). A TIA is a temporary disruption of blood flow to the brain, causing stroke-like symptoms. This can include sudden weakness, numbness, and sometimes incontinence. The symptoms resolve within 24 hours. In this case, her symptoms are brief (a few minutes) and resolve, which fits a TIA. However, the patient has rheumatoid arthritis, which is a systemic disease. Could RA be causing vasculitis leading to TIAs? Maybe, but I'm not sure if that's the most likely cause here.

Option G: Adrenal insufficiency. This can cause fatigue, weight loss, and other symptoms. But does it cause drop attacks? I don't think so. Adrenal insufficiency presents more with chronic symptoms like low blood pressure, hypoglycemia, and electrolyte imbalances. Acute attacks of weakness don't ring a bell with this condition.

Option H: Hypoglycemia. This can cause sweating, palpitations, confusion, and weakness. If her blood sugar drops too low, she could feel weak and maybe lose consciousness. Incontinence could happen if she can't reach the bathroom in time. But does this fit with her other symptoms? She's on aspirin and ibuprofen, which don't cause hypoglycemia. Unless she's on other medications like insulin or certain diabetes meds, but that's not mentioned.

Option I: Atlanto-axial instability. This refers to instability in the upper part of the spine, between the atlas and axis vertebrae. It can cause neurological symptoms like weakness, numbness, and incontinence. People with RA can have cervical spine issues because of the inflammation and erosion of the joints. Atlanto-axial instability can lead to compression of the spinal cord or nerves, causing episodes of weakness and other symptoms. This seems plausible because the drop attacks are brief and related to her underlying arthritis.

So, putting it together, the patient has RA with joint deformities. She's having episodes of weakness and incontinence. Atlanto-axial instability (option I) is a known complication in rheumatoid arthritis. The instability can cause sudden neurological deficits due to compression of the spinal cord or nerves when the neck is in certain positions, leading to these drop attacks. The incontinence would be due to loss of control from nerve compression affecting the bladder.

Other options don't fit as well. Spinal stenosis (B) is possible, but it's more chronic. TIA (F) could be a possibility, but RA-related vasculitis is less common. Anxiety (E) doesn't explain the physical findings. So, the most likely answer is I: Atlanto-axial instability.

The patient's "drop attacks" are most likely caused by atlanto-axial instability, a known complication in rheumatoid arthritis. This instability can lead to sudden neurological symptoms due to spinal cord or nerve compression, explaining the episodes of weakness, loss of feeling, and incontinence. 

Answer: I
