The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

A 36-year-old man comes to the office because of headaches that began 2 weeks ago. The headaches are moderately severe, are present when he awakens in the morning, and are relieved with over-the-counter analgesics. He has no prior history of headaches. He tells you he was promoted to an upper-level managerial position in his accounting firm about 8 months ago, which necessitated relocating. Physical examination now discloses no abnormalities except for blurring of the optic disc margins bilaterally. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step?

Options:

A: Refer him for consultation with an ophthalmologist
B: Begin a trial of a Î²-blocking medication
C: Begin a trial of an anti-inflammatory medication
D: Refer him for consultation with a psychiatrist
E: Prescribe over-the-counter analgesics for long term use
F: Refer him for consultation with a neurologist
G: Order CT scan of the head
H: Advise him to reduce stress and monitor symptoms
I: Order MRI of the head
J: Order EEG

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about a patient with headaches, and I need to figure out the best next step. Let me read through it carefully.

The patient is a 36-year-old man who came in with headaches that started two weeks ago. The headaches are moderately severe, worse in the morning, and he gets relief with OTC analgesics. He has no prior history of headaches. He was promoted and moved 8 months ago. On exam, the only abnormality is blurred optic disc margins bilaterally.

Hmm, so the key points are the new morning headaches, recent move and promotion, and the optic disc blurring. Blurred optic discs can be a sign of increased intracranial pressure (ICP). Headaches that are worse in the morning and respond to analgesics could be consistent with tension headaches, but the optic disc finding is concerning.

Wait, tension headaches usually aren't associated with optic disc changes. So, what else causes morning headaches and optic disc issues? Migraines can cause severe headaches but typically have other features like nausea, visual auras, etc. But the blurring here is more concerning for something like papilledema, which is a sign of elevated ICP.

Elevated ICP can be due to hydrocephalus, brain tumors, or other space-occupying lesions. Since the patient's headaches have been ongoing for two weeks and he's never had them before, especially with a change in environment, it's worth considering a structural cause.

The physical exam shows bilateral disc blurring. That's a key clue. So, the first thought is to rule out a neurological cause. The possible options for next steps include referring to an ophthalmologist, a neurologist, getting imaging, etc.

Looking at the options:

A: Refer to ophthalmologist. Well, the issue is with optic discs, but they might be a sign of ICP, which is a neurological issue, not just an eye problem. So maybe the ophthalmologist would be involved, but perhaps a neurologist is more appropriate first.

F: Refer to a neurologist. That makes sense because the symptoms could indicate a neurological condition.

G: CT scan. Imaging is often the next step when suspecting increased ICP or structural issues. But the question is about the next step, and sometimes initial evaluation includes imaging.

I: MRI. MRI is better for soft tissue and brain issues compared to CT, which is better for bone and acute hemorrhage. Since there's no indication of trauma or hemorrhage, MRI might be more informative.

So, considering the blurred optic discs, the most likely next steps would be imaging. Let me think about when to refer versus when to image. If there's a suspicion of increased ICP, imaging is crucial. So, perhaps ordering an MRI of the head (option I) or referring to a neurologist (option F) would be appropriate.

But wait, the initial question is about the next step. If the physical exam shows signs that could indicate a serious condition, imaging is often done before referral. So, the doctor might order an MRI to look for any structural abnormalities like tumors, hydrocephalus, etc.

Alternatively, referring to a neurologist could be the next step because they can evaluate the symptoms and order imaging if needed. But the question asks for the most appropriate next step, which might be imaging.

Another angle: the patient has a new, persistent headache pattern with a concerning physical sign. So, the priority would be to rule out serious causes. That points towards imaging, specifically an MRI (option I) or a CT scan (option G). Since MRI is better for brain tissue, I might lean towards that.

But wait, sometimes the first imaging in such cases is a CT scan because it's quicker, but if no acute issues are suspected, MRI is better. Since there's no indication of acute symptoms like seizures or trauma, an MRI would be more thorough.

So, the options are F (neurologist) and I (MRI). Which is more appropriate? In clinical practice, sometimes the next step is to refer to a specialist, but if the findings are concerning, imaging is done first.

Wait, but the question says "the most appropriate next step." In this case, the physical exam shows optic disc blurring, which is a sign that needs further investigation. So, imaging is indicated to look for structural causes. Therefore, the next step would be to order an MRI of the head (option I) or a CT scan.

Between G and I: If the patient has no other signs like neurological deficits, but the optic discs are blurred, an MRI is more sensitive for brain lesions. So, I would choose option I: Order MRI of the head.
</think>

The patient presents with new, persistent headaches, morning worse, and bilateral blurred optic discs, suggesting increased intracranial pressure (ICP). These findings necessitate further investigation to rule out structural causes such as hydrocephalus, tumors, or other space-occupying lesions. While imaging is crucial, the question asks for the most appropriate next step. Given the concerning physical signs, ordering an MRI of the head (option I) is the best choice to assess for structural abnormalities. MRI is more sensitive for brain tissue and provides detailed imaging to identify potential causes of elevated ICP.

Answer:
I
