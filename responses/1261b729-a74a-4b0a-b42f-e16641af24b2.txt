Okay, so I have this polynomial: 2x^5 + 8x - 7, and I need to find how many real roots it has. The options are from A to J, and I have to choose the correct one. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra says a polynomial of degree n has exactly n roots, counting multiplicities, but those can be real or complex. Since this is a 5th-degree polynomial, there are 5 roots total, but some might be complex.

Now, complex roots come in conjugate pairs, so the number of real roots must be odd if the degree is odd. Because 5 is odd, the number of real roots should be odd as well. So possible real roots could be 1, 3, or 5. But wait, looking at the options, I see E is Five and J is One. So I need to figure out how many real roots this specific polynomial has.

Maybe I can use the Intermediate Value Theorem. That theorem says that if a continuous function changes sign over an interval, there's at least one root in that interval. Since polynomials are continuous, this should work.

Let me evaluate the polynomial at some points. Let's start with x=0. Plugging in, I get 2*(0)^5 +8*0 -7 = -7. So f(0) = -7.

Now, let's try x=1: 2*(1)^5 +8*1 -7 = 2 +8 -7 = 3. So f(1) = 3. The function goes from -7 at x=0 to 3 at x=1, so it crosses the x-axis somewhere between 0 and 1. That's at least one real root.

What about as x approaches positive infinity? The leading term is 2x^5, which dominates, so as x→∞, f(x)→∞. And as x→-∞, since the exponent is odd, f(x)→-∞ because 2x^5 will dominate and negative x to the fifth is negative. So the function goes from negative infinity at the left to positive infinity on the right.

Wait, but maybe the function only crosses the x-axis once. Let me check the behavior between other points. Let me try x= -1: f(-1) = 2*(-1)^5 +8*(-1) -7 = -2 -8 -7 = -17. So f(-1)=-17, which is negative. At x=0, it's -7. At x=1, it's 3. So between 0 and 1, it goes from -7 to 3, so one root there. But what about between negative infinity and 0?

Wait, let's see: as x approaches negative infinity, f(x) approaches negative infinity, and at x=0, it's -7. So the function is decreasing from negative infinity to x=0, but wait, is it always decreasing? Or does it have any turning points?

To check if there are any turning points, I can take the derivative. The derivative of f(x) is f’(x) = 10x^4 +8. Wait, 2x^5 derivative is 10x^4, 8x derivative is 8, and the derivative of -7 is 0. So f’(x) = 10x^4 +8.

Now, 10x^4 is always non-negative because any real number to the 4th power is non-negative, and multiplied by 10 makes it positive. Adding 8 makes f’(x) always positive (since 10x^4 >=0, so 10x^4 +8 >=8>0). So the derivative is always positive, meaning the function is strictly increasing everywhere. 

If the function is strictly increasing, it can cross the x-axis at most once. Because if it's always going up, it can't turn around and cross again. So since we already found that f(0)=-7 and f(1)=3, it crosses once between 0 and 1. Also, since as x approaches negative infinity, f(x) approaches negative infinity, and at x=0 it's -7, but since it's increasing, it's coming from negative infinity and increasing, passing through -7 at x=0, then continues to increase to 3 at x=1, and then keeps increasing to positive infinity. So it can only cross the x-axis once.

Wait, but let me make sure. If the function is strictly increasing, it must cross the x-axis exactly once. Because it goes from negative infinity to positive infinity, passing through all y-values exactly once. So there's exactly one real root.

Wait, but earlier I thought maybe there could be more, but with the derivative being always positive, that's not possible. So the answer should be J: One.
</think>

The polynomial \(2x^5 + 8x - 7\) is of degree 5, so it has 5 roots in total. Complex roots come in pairs, so the number of real roots must be odd. Evaluating the polynomial at specific points shows it crosses the x-axis once between \(x=0\) and \(x=1\). The derivative \(f'(x) = 10x^4 + 8\) is always positive, meaning the function is strictly increasing and can only cross the x-axis once. Therefore, the polynomial has exactly one real root.
