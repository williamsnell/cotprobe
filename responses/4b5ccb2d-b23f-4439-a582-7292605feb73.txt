Alright, so I'm trying to figure out this question about Rawls and why he thinks parties in the original position wouldn't accept utilitarianism. Okay, let me break this down.

First, I remember that Rawls talked about the "original position" in his theory of justice. It's this hypothetical situation where people are choosing principles of justice without knowing their place in society. They're behind a "veil of ignorance," meaning they don't know their social status, wealth, or anything like that. This setup is supposed to make them choose fair principles because they don't know if they'll be the ones benefiting or the ones suffering.

Now, the question is about why they wouldn't accept utilitarianism. Utilitarianism is the idea that the best action is the one that maximizes overall happiness or utility. It's often associated with the principle of the greatest good for the greatest number. But Rawls is critical of this approach.

Looking at the options:

A: It's too hard to determine which policies maximize happiness. Hmm, while it's true that calculating happiness can be tricky, I don't think that's the main reason Rawls rejects utilitarianism. He's more concerned about the justice and fairness aspects rather than the practicality of determining policies.

B: Doing so would be too risky. Risky in what sense? I'm not sure. Maybe the uncertainty of outcomes? But again, I don't recall Rawls focusing on risk as the main issue. He's more about fairness and justice.

C: It requires doing unjust things, like executing innocent people. That sounds more plausible. Utilitarianism can sometimes justify actions that seem morally wrong if they result in a greater good. For example, if killing one person would save five, some utilitarians might say it's acceptable. But Rawls's theory is about justice and individual rights, so he would argue against such actions. In the original position, people would want to ensure their rights aren't violated, even if it leads to a slightly less happy society.

D: They're behind the veil of ignorance and never heard of utilitarianism. That seems unlikely. The original position is a thought experiment, so participants are assumed to have sufficient rationality and knowledge to consider different theories. They would know about utilitarianism, so this isn't the reason.

So, putting it together, the correct answer should be C because Rawls argues that utilitarianism can justify actions that are unjust, which the parties in the original position would reject to ensure their own rights and justice.

The correct answer is C: they would reject utilitarianism because it can require unjust actions, such as executing innocent people, which the parties in the original position would avoid to protect their own rights and ensure justice.
