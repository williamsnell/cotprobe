Okay, so I need to figure out this economics question about price elasticity of demand and how it affects total revenue. Let me start by recalling what I know about price elasticity.

Price elasticity of demand (PED) measures how responsive the quantity demanded of a good is to a change in its price. The formula is PED = % change in quantity demanded / % change in price. If PED is greater than 1, demand is elastic, meaning that a small change in price leads to a large change in quantity demanded. If it's less than 1, demand is inelastic, so price changes don't significantly affect quantity demanded.

The question says the PED is 3, which is greater than 1, so demand is elastic. The business wants to raise total revenue. I remember that when demand is elastic, lowering the price can increase total revenue. Because if you decrease the price, the quantity sold increases more than proportionally, leading to higher revenue. Conversely, if demand were inelastic, raising the price would increase revenue because the quantity demanded wouldn't drop much, but the higher price would more than offset the smaller decrease in quantity.

So looking at the options, I need to find which one suggests decreasing the price when demand is elastic. Let's go through the options:

A: Keep the price constant as demand is elastic. Hmm, but if demand is elastic, keeping the price the same might not maximize revenue. Because if you lower the price, you could sell more and increase revenue.

B: Decrease price as demand is inelastic. Wait, no, the PED here is elastic, not inelastic. So B is incorrect because it's talking about inelastic demand.

C: Decrease the quality of the product. That doesn't directly relate to price elasticity. Lower quality might affect demand, but the question is about price, not product quality.

D: Increase price as demand is elastic. Wait, if demand is elastic, increasing the price would likely decrease the quantity sold more than proportionally, leading to lower revenue. So D is incorrect.

E: Increase price as demand is inelastic. Again, this is about inelastic, which isn't the case here.

F: Decrease the quantity of the product. Not sure how quantity relates here. The business could control production, but the question is about price adjustments. Decreasing quantity might not be the right approach.

G: Increase the quality of the product. Similar to C, this is about product quality, not price. PED is about price, so this might not directly affect revenue in the way the question is framed.

H: Increase the quantity of the product. Again, this is about how much they produce, not the price. If they increase production, they might have to lower prices if supply exceeds demand, but that's not directly the action here.

I: Decrease price as demand is elastic. This matches what I thought earlier. Since PED is 3 (elastic), decreasing the price would lead to a significant increase in quantity demanded, thus increasing total revenue.

J: Keep the price constant as demand is inelastic. This is wrong because the PED is elastic, and the advice would be different.

So the correct option is I: decrease price as demand is elastic.

The correct answer is I: decrease price as demand is elastic.
