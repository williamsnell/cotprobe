Question:

Consider the distribution of the previous problem. Let us add 2 relatively high values in order to observe the differential effecton the three measures of central tendency. Use the followingeight ordered values: 3, 5, 6, 6, 7, 9, 16, 20.

Options:

A: Mean is unaffected, median is somewhat affected, mode is most affected
B: Median is most affected, mean is somewhat affected, mode is unaffected
C: All measures are unaffected
D: Mean and median are equally affected, mode is most affected
E: All measures are equally affected
F: Mean is most affected, median is somewhat affected, mode is unaffected
G: Median is unaffected, mean and mode are equally affected
H: Mode and median are equally affected, mean is unaffected
I: Mode is unaffected, mean is somewhat affected, median is most affected
J: Mode is most affected, median is somewhat affected, mean is unaffected

Okay, so I've got this statistics problem here, and I need to figure out the answer. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked. 

The question says: "Consider the distribution of the previous problem. Let us add 2 relatively high values in order to observe the differential effect on the three measures of central tendency." The data provided are eight ordered values: 3, 5, 6, 6, 7, 9, 16, 20. The options are A through J, each describing how the mean, median, and mode are affected by adding these two high values.

Wait, the first sentence mentions "the distribution of the previous problem." Hmm, I don't have the previous problem, but I think I can work with what's given here. The data set is already provided, so I can work with that. 

So the original data set is: 3, 5, 6, 6, 7, 9, 16, 20. Let me calculate the mean, median, and mode of this original set to get a baseline. Then, I'll add two high values, which I assume are significantly larger than the current maximum of 20. Let's say we add two more high values, say 25 and 30, just as examples. But wait, the problem doesn't specify what the two high values are, but since they are "relatively high," they should be much larger than the existing data points. So for the sake of calculation, let me pick 25 and 30 as the two new values. 

First, calculate the original measures:

Original data: 3,5,6,6,7,9,16,20.

Mean: Sum all values and divide by 8. Sum is 3+5=8, +6=14, +6=20, +7=27, +9=36, +16=52, +20=72. So sum is 72. Mean is 72/8=9.

Median: Since there are 8 numbers, the median is the average of the 4th and 5th terms. The 4th is 6, 5th is 7. So median is (6+7)/2=6.5.

Mode: The number that appears most frequently. Here, 6 appears twice, others appear once. So mode is 6.

Now, adding two high values: let's take 25 and 30. So new data set becomes: 3,5,6,6,7,9,16,20,25,30. Now, let's recalculate mean, median, and mode.

New data set sorted: 3,5,6,6,7,9,16,20,25,30. Now, there are 10 data points.

Mean: Sum is 72 (original) +25+30=72+55=127. Mean is 127/10=12.7.

Median: With 10 data points, the median is the average of the 5th and 6th terms. The 5th is 7, 6th is 9. So median is (7+9)/2=8.

Mode: Still 6, as it appears twice. The other numbers appear once or twice, but no change here.

So let's see the effects:

- Mean: Original was 9, now 12.7. So it increased significantly.
- Median: Original 6.5, now 8. It increased, but not as much as the mean.
- Mode: Still 6. No change.

Now, the question is about the differential effect. Which of the three is most affected, somewhat affected, or unaffected.

Looking at the options:

A: Mean is unaffected, median is somewhat affected, mode is most affected. No, because mean increased a lot, so A is wrong.

B: Median is most affected, mean is somewhat affected, mode is unaffected. No, median changed from 6.5 to 8, mean changed more.

C: All measures are unaffected. No, mean and median changed.

D: Mean and median are equally affected, mode is most affected. No, mode didn't change; mean and median both changed, but mean more so.

E: All measures are equally affected. No, only mean and median changed.

F: Mean is most affected, median is somewhat affected, mode is unaffected. Yes, mean increased more than median.

G: Median is unaffected, mean and mode are equally affected. No, median changed.

H: Mode and median are equally affected, mean is unaffected. No, mean changed more.

I: Mode is unaffected, mean is somewhat affected, median is most affected. No, mean changed more.

J: Mode is most affected, median is somewhat affected, mean is unaffected. No, mode didn't change.

Wait, from my calculation, the mean increased more than the median. So the mean is most affected, median somewhat, mode not at all.

Looking back at the options, option F says: Mean is most affected, median is somewhat affected, mode is unaffected. That matches.

Wait, but let me double-check. When I added 25 and 30, the sum went up by 55, so the mean went from 9 to 12.7, which is an increase of 3.7.

The median went from 6.5 to 8, an increase of 1.5.

So yes, mean is more affected than median. Mode remains the same.

So the correct option is F.

The mean is most affected by the addition of high values, followed by the median, with the mode remaining unchanged.

F
