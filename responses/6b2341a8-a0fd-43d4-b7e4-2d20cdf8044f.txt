Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the answer to this multiple-choice question about House's Path-Goal Theory of Leadership. The question is about the Instrumental leadership style and what it entails. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I remember that Path-Goal Theory was developed by Robert House. The theory suggests that leaders should behave in ways that help their subordinates achieve their goals, which in turn leads to higher satisfaction and motivation. There are four different leadership styles mentioned in this theory: Directive, Supportive, Participative, and Achievement-oriented. Wait, but the question is asking about Instrumental leadership. Hmm, I think Instrumental might be another term for one of these styles. Maybe it's the same as Directive or Achievement-oriented? I'm a bit confused there.

Looking at the options, I need to match the Instrumental leadership style with one of the descriptions provided. I recall that Instrumental leadership is task-focused. The leader's main goal is to help subordinates achieve their work goals efficiently. They focus on the task at hand and might set clear goals, provide direction, and ensure that subordinates have the resources they need to perform well.

So, looking at the options:

A: focuses on creating a positive work environment – This sounds more like Supportive leadership, which is about making the work environment pleasant and supportive for the employees.

B: includes subordinates in decision-making – That's Participative leadership, where the leader involves the team in decisions, which increases their involvement and commitment.

C: provides feedback and recognition for a job well done – This is more about the supportive aspect, giving positive reinforcement, but maybe also part of Directive if it's about correcting behavior.

D: encourages subordinates to work independently – I'm not sure. Directive leaders might give clear instructions but also monitor progress, so maybe not exactly this.

E: sets challenging goals and encourage higher levels of performance – This sounds like the Achievement-oriented style, where the leader sets high goals to motivate subordinates to perform better.

F: establishes supportive relationships with subordinates – Again, that's the Supportive leadership style.

G: emphasizes the importance of team building and collaboration – That's more about Participative or maybe Transformational leadership.

H: places a high value on employee engagement and participation – Participative again.

I: encourages subordinates to develop their own goals and objectives – That's more of a laissez-faire approach or maybe Transformational, where employees are self-directed.

J: provides specific guidelines and clear rules and procedures – This sounds like Directive leadership, where the leader sets clear expectations and procedures for subordinates to follow.

Wait, but the question is about Instrumental leadership. I think in some contexts, Instrumental can be similar to Directive or Achievement-oriented. But I'm trying to recall. House's Path-Goal Theory differentiates between Directive and Achievement-oriented. Directive leaders provide clear guidance and structure, while Achievement-oriented leaders set challenging goals and expect high performance.

But the question is about Instrumental. Maybe Instrumental is another way of saying Directive or Achievement-oriented. Alternatively, maybe it's a broader category. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is E, which is about setting challenging goals, which aligns with the Achievement-oriented style. Or maybe it's J, which is about clear guidelines, aligning with Directive.

Wait, the question says that the Path-Goal Theory predicts satisfaction and motivation when subordinates believe the leader is helping. The Instrumental style would be focused on the task and achieving the goals. So, providing specific guidelines (J) would help subordinates achieve their tasks, but setting challenging goals (E) would also be about helping them perform better.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is E because it's about encouraging higher performance, which directly relates to the leader helping subordinates achieve their goals, thus increasing their satisfaction and motivation.

But I'm a bit torn between E and J. Let me think again. The Directive style provides guidance and structure, which is about clear rules and procedures. The Achievement-oriented style sets challenging goals. The question is about the Instrumental style, which I think is more about the task and achieving goals, so E might be the right answer.

Wait, but some sources say that Instrumental leadership in Path-Goal Theory is about providing clear direction and ensuring that the path to goals is clear. So it might include setting goals and providing guidelines. So, looking at the options, J is about clear guidelines and procedures, which is Directive. E is about challenging goals, which is Achievement-oriented.

But the question is about Instrumental leadership. Maybe I'm mixing up terms. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is E because it's about the leader setting challenging goals, which is part of the Achievement-oriented style, one of the four styles in Path-Goal Theory. So the question is, is the Instrumental style referring to one of these? Or is it a different term?

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is E because the leader is helping by setting challenging goals, which in turn leads to higher performance and satisfaction. That makes sense because when leaders set high but achievable goals, subordinates are more motivated to meet them, leading to higher satisfaction when they succeed.

Alternatively, J is about guidelines and procedures, which is Directive. So which one is Instrumental? I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should look up the definition. Wait, I can't look things up, but I'll try to recall.

In Path-Goal Theory, the four styles are:

1. Directive: provides clear guidance and structure.
2. Supportive: creates a pleasant environment.
3. Participative: involves subordinates in decisions.
4. Achievement-oriented: sets challenging goals.

So, which of these is Instrumental? I think that the Achievement-oriented style is sometimes referred to as Instrumental because it's about focusing on the task and achieving results. So the answer would be E: sets challenging goals and encourage higher levels of performance.

Alternatively, some sources might use "instrumental" to refer to Directive leadership because it's about the tools (instrumental) the leader uses to guide the subordinate. But I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is J: provides specific guidelines and clear rules and procedures, which aligns with Directive. But the question is about Instrumental leadership, which I think is more about the task and achieving goals, so E would be the better fit.

Wait, the question is about how Instrumental leadership style is described. If Instrumental is the same as Directive, then J would be correct. But if it's the same as Achievement-oriented, then E is correct.

I think I need to make a decision based on my understanding. Since the question says that the leader is helping, and the theory predicts satisfaction and motivation when subordinates believe the leader is helping, the Achievement-oriented style (E) sets challenging goals, which would help subordinates achieve more, thus being perceived as helping. So I think the answer is E.

The question asks about the Instrumental leadership style within House's Path-Goal Theory of Leadership. This theory includes four leadership styles: Directive, Supportive, Participative, and Achievement-oriented. Instrumental leadership is task-focused and emphasizes helping subordinates achieve their goals. Among the options, E: sets challenging goals and encourages higher levels of performance aligns with the Achievement-oriented style, which is part of the Path-Goal Theory and fits the description of Instrumental leadership. Therefore, the correct answer is:

E
