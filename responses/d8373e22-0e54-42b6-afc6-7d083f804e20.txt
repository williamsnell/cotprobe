Okay, so I've got this question about Turing machines and decidability. Hmm, let's try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my theory of computation, but I'll think through this carefully.

The question presents a single-tape deterministic Turing machine M with a tape alphabet that includes blank, 0, and 1. The computation C starts with a blank tape. There are three problems, I, II, and III, and I need to determine which are decidable.

Let me restate the problems to make sure I understand them:

I. The computation C lasts for at least n steps. So, does M take n or more steps before halting?

II. The computation C lasts at least n steps, and after the nth step, M prints a 1 somewhere. So, after n steps, M must have written a 1 on the tape at some point.

III. M scans at least n distinct tape squares during computation C. So, how many cells does the tape head move over before stopping?

The options are various combinations, and I need to pick which are decidable.

First, I should recall what a decidable problem is. A problem is decidable if there's an algorithm (Turing machine) that can always solve it in finite time. So, for each of these problems, I need to see if there's a way to determine the answer given M and n.

Let me tackle each problem one by one.

Problem I: Does the computation last at least n steps?

Wait, so this is asking whether M doesn't halt before step n. So, for any M, can we decide whether it will run for at least n steps?

Hmm, I'm trying to remember if the halting problem is decidable. Oh wait, the standard halting problem is undecidable: given M and an input, whether it halts is not decidable. But here, the input is a blank tape, and we're not directly asking if it halts, but whether it runs at least n steps.

Wait, but isn't this similar to checking if M halts within n steps? Because if it does, then the computation doesn't last at least n steps. So, if we can determine whether M halts within n steps, then we can answer whether it runs at least n steps.

But wait, the problem is whether it runs for at least n steps, meaning it doesn't halt before step n. So, if M halts at step k where k < n, then the answer is no. If it doesn't halt before n steps, the answer is yes.

But how can we determine if M halts within n steps? Because for each M, we can simulate it for exactly n steps and see if it halts. Since n is a given input, for any M, we can simulate up to step n. If it hasn't halted by then, we know it runs at least n steps. If it halts earlier, then it doesn't.

Wait, that's a crucial point. So for problem I, the answer is yes if M hasn't halted by step n-1. Because if it halts at step k where k < n, then it hasn't run for at least n steps. So, to decide problem I, we can simulate M for n-1 steps. If it's still running, then yes. If it halts before, then no.

Wait, but let's clarify. The question is whether the computation lasts for at least n steps. So, the machine must take n steps or more before halting. So, if M halts at step n, then yes. If it halts before, then no. So to check this, we can simulate M for n steps. If it hasn't halted by step n, then it's still running, so it takes more than n steps. Wait, no: if it halts exactly at step n, then the computation has lasted exactly n steps, so it meets the condition of at least n. So, to determine if it runs for at least n steps, we can simulate up to step n-1. If it's still running at step n-1, then by step n it might halt or continue. Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, let me think again. The problem is whether the computation takes at least n steps, i.e., it doesn't halt before step n. So, if M halts at step n, that's acceptable because it's exactly n steps. So, to determine this, we can simulate M up to n steps. If it halts at step n, then yes. If it halts at step k < n, then no. If it hasn't halted by step n, then it's still running, so it's taken at least n steps. Wait, but that's not quite right because if it hasn't halted by step n, it's still running, so it's possible it will take more than n steps, but the question is just whether it takes at least n steps. So, if it hasn't halted by step n-1, then it's taken at least n steps. Because if it halts at step n, that's exactly n steps, which is acceptable.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The key point is that for problem I, we can simulate M for n steps. If it hasn't halted by then, then it's taken at least n steps. Because if it had halted before n steps, it would have done so by step n-1. So, if after n steps, M hasn't halted, then the answer is yes. If it has halted by step n, then whether it's at least n steps depends on when it halted. For example, if it halted at step n, then yes. If it halted at step 5, then no.

Wait, no. Because the problem is whether the computation takes at least n steps. So, if it halts at step n, then yes. If it halts after n steps, say step n+1, then yes. If it halts at step k where k < n, then no.

So, to determine whether M runs for at least n steps, we can simulate it for n steps. If it halts during those n steps, and the halting step is >=n, then yes. Wait, but that's not possible because if it halts at step n, then yes. But if it halts at step k <n, then no.

Wait, no. Because the computation might take exactly n steps to halt. So, if we simulate for n steps, and it's still running, then it's taken at least n steps. If it halts during those n steps, then we need to check whether it halted at step n or before. So, in that case, if it halted at step n, then yes. If it halted before, then no.

Wait, but how can we know that? Because during the simulation, when we reach step n, if it hasn't halted, then it has taken at least n steps. If it halted at step n, then yes. If it halted before, then no.

So, to decide problem I, we can simulate M for n steps. If it hasn't halted by step n, then the answer is yes. If it has halted by step n, then we need to check whether it halted exactly at step n. If yes, then yes. If it halted earlier, then no.

Wait, but in practice, when we simulate up to step n, we can track when it halted. So, if it halted at step k where k <=n, then the answer is yes only if k >=n. Otherwise, no.

So, for problem I, the decision procedure is: simulate M for n steps. If it halts at step k where k >=n, then yes. If it halts before step n, then no. If it hasn't halted by step n, then yes.

Wait, but if it hasn't halted by step n, then it's still running, so it's taken at least n steps. So, the answer is yes in that case.

Therefore, problem I is decidable because we can simulate M for n steps and make the decision based on whether it has halted by then and at which step.

So, I is decidable.

Problem II: The computation C lasts for at least n steps, and M prints a 1 at some point after the nth step.

So, this is a conjunction of two conditions. The first is that the computation lasts at least n steps (as in problem I), and the second is that after the nth step, M prints a 1 at some point.

Wait, but does it mean that after the nth step, M writes a 1 somewhere on the tape? So, if the computation is longer than n steps, and at some point beyond the nth step, M writes a 1.

Hmm, but how can we determine this? Let's think about it.

First, the computation must last at least n steps. So, problem I's condition must be satisfied. Then, after the nth step, M must write a 1 at some position on the tape.

But how can we check this? Well, perhaps we can simulate M up to step n, and then see if after that, it writes a 1.

Wait, but the machine might take more than n steps, and after step n, it might write a 1 somewhere.

But how can we determine whether such a 1 is written at some point after step n?

Hmm, this seems tricky because after step n, the computation could continue indefinitely, and we might not know whether a 1 is ever written.

Wait, but perhaps we can model this as: after step n, does the machine ever write a 1 on the tape. So, does there exist a step k >n such that M writes a 1 at step k.

But how can we decide this? Well, perhaps we can simulate M beyond step n, and check if any step after n writes a 1.

But wait, simulating beyond step n could be an infinite process. So, how do we know when to stop?

Alternatively, perhaps we can model this as a new problem: does M, starting from a blank tape, write a 1 at some position after step n.

Wait, but this seems similar to checking whether, for some k >=n+1, M writes a 1 at step k.

But how can we know this? Because M could write a 1 at some point after n, or it might never do so.

Wait, but perhaps we can encode this as a new Turing machine problem. Let me think.

Suppose we create a new Turing machine M' that runs M for n steps, then continues to run M beyond step n, and checks whether any step after n writes a 1.

But how can we model this? Well, perhaps we can model M' as follows:

- Simulate M for exactly n steps. If M halts before n steps, then M' halts and returns no because the first condition (running at least n steps) isn't met. If M hasn't halted by step n, then M' continues running M beyond step n, and checks whether any step after n writes a 1.

But how can M' know whether, in the subsequent steps, M will ever write a 1? Because this could go on infinitely, and M' might not terminate.

Wait, but perhaps the problem can be transformed into a decidable problem. Let's think about it.

If we can determine whether M, after step n, will ever write a 1, then problem II is decidable. But is that possible?

Alternatively, perhaps we can model this as a reachability problem. After step n, is there any state in which M writes a 1 on the tape.

Wait, but the tape is potentially infinite, so that's challenging.

Alternatively, perhaps we can consider the tape as a finite automaton beyond step n, but that's not feasible because the tape is infinite.

Wait, but maybe we can model M's behavior after step n as a finite automaton, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps we can consider the problem of whether M writes a 1 after step n as a decidable problem by using a modified Turing machine.

Wait, perhaps another approach: for problem II, the answer is yes if and only if:

- M doesn't halt within n steps (so it runs for at least n steps).

- After the nth step, M writes a 1 on the tape at some point.

But how can we model this?

Hmm, perhaps we can construct a new Turing machine that, given M and n, simulates M up to step n, and then, if M is still running, continues to simulate and checks if any step after n writes a 1.

But the problem is that simulating beyond n steps could take infinitely long, so we can't just simulate indefinitely.

Wait, but perhaps we can use the concept of a busy beaver function, but that's more about maximum steps, not about detecting a 1.

Alternatively, perhaps we can model this as a finite automaton that keeps track of the tape beyond step n. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: For problem II, it's a combination of two conditions. The first is decidable (problem I), and the second is whether, after step n, M writes a 1 at some point.

But the second part seems like it's equivalent to: does there exist a k >=n+1 such that M writes a 1 at step k.

But how can we determine that? Because M could run forever without writing a 1 after step n.

Wait, perhaps the second part is equivalent to: does M, starting from the configuration after step n, ever write a 1.

But how can we model that? It's like a reachability problem in an infinite state machine.

Wait, perhaps we can model this as a new problem where we check whether, starting from the state and tape configuration after step n, M ever writes a 1.

But the tape after step n is some configuration, which may be finite or infinite, but M could be in any state.

Wait, but since M is deterministic, the state after step n is fixed. So, perhaps we can model this as a finite automaton where, given the state and tape configuration after step n, does M ever write a 1.

But the tape is potentially infinite, so it's challenging to model.

Alternatively, perhaps we can consider that after step n, the machine's behavior is determined, and whether it writes a 1 can be determined by running it until it either writes a 1 or halts.

Wait, but that's not feasible because it could loop indefinitely without ever writing a 1.

Hmm, perhaps this is related to the Post Correspondence Problem or other undecidable problems.

Wait, but let's think about it differently. Suppose after step n, M is in a state q, and the tape has a certain configuration. We can model the problem as: does M, starting from this state and tape configuration, ever write a 1.

If we can solve this, then problem II is decidable.

But I'm not sure if this is possible. Let's think about the possible scenarios:

1. After step n, M halts without writing any 1s. Then the answer is no.

2. After step n, M writes a 1 at some point before halting. Then the answer is yes.

3. After step n, M writes a 1 and then continues to run indefinitely. Then the answer is yes.

4. After step n, M runs indefinitely without ever writing a 1. Then the answer is no.

But how can we determine which case it is? It's unclear because if M runs forever without writing a 1, we can't know that in finite time.

Wait, but perhaps we can model this as a finite automaton. Since M is a Turing machine with a finite number of states, and each step depends only on the current state and the tape symbol, perhaps we can model the possible transitions after step n.

Wait, but the tape is infinite, so that's a problem. However, the tape's content after step n is a finite string, but it could be expanding in either direction.

Alternatively, perhaps we can model the tape after step n as a finite string (since M could have written up to a certain point), and then model the machine's behavior beyond that.

But I'm not sure if this approach would work because the tape is infinite, and the machine could write beyond any finite point.

Wait, but perhaps we can consider that after step n, M's tape is a finite string, and beyond that, it's all blanks. So, perhaps we can model the machine's behavior as it operates on this finite string, possibly expanding it.

But again, I'm not sure how to model this to determine whether a 1 is ever written.

Alternatively, perhaps we can consider that if M, after step n, can write a 1, then it must do so within a finite number of steps. But that's not necessarily true; M could write a 1 after any number of steps.

Wait, but perhaps the key is that problem II requires that after the nth step, M prints a 1 at some point. So, if after n steps, M is in a state where it will eventually print a 1, then the answer is yes.

But how can we determine that? It seems similar to the halting problem, which is undecidable.

Wait, but wait: problem II is a combination of two conditions. The first condition is that the computation lasts at least n steps, which is decidable as we discussed for problem I. The second condition is that after the nth step, M prints a 1 at some point.

But the second condition is equivalent to: does M print a 1 during the (n+1)th step or beyond.

Hmm, but how can we model that? Because this is similar to the question of whether M, starting from the state after step n, will ever write a 1.

This seems like a variant of the halting problem, but for a specific condition (writing a 1).

Wait, but perhaps we can construct a new Turing machine that, given M and n, simulates M up to step n, and then continues to simulate M beyond that, checking each step whether a 1 is written. If a 1 is written, the machine halts and returns yes. If M halts without writing a 1, it returns no. However, if M enters a loop and never writes a 1, the machine will run forever, making the problem undecidable.

Wait, but that's a problem because we can't simulate forever. So, the question is, can we determine in finite time whether M will ever write a 1 after step n?

If M will write a 1 after some finite number of steps beyond n, then yes. If it runs forever without writing a 1, then no. But how can we decide that in finite time?

This seems similar to the problem of determining whether a program will ever output a specific value, which is generally undecidable.

Wait, but perhaps for some cases, it's decidable. For example, if after step n, M is in a state that can only write 0s and blanks, then the answer is no. Otherwise, it's yes.

But I'm not sure how to formalize that.

Alternatively, perhaps we can model this as a reachability problem in a finite automaton, but given the infinite tape, it's unclear.

Hmm, perhaps problem II is undecidable because it's equivalent to the halting problem with an added condition of writing a 1, which could be as hard as the halting problem.

Wait, but the halting problem is undecidable, so any problem that reduces to it is also undecidable.

Alternatively, perhaps problem II is decidable because we can simulate up to some point and make a decision.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about problem III first, maybe that's easier.

Problem III: M scans at least n distinct tape squares during computation C.

So, how many cells does the tape head move over before stopping? We need to know if it's at least n.

Hmm, so the head starts at position 0 (let's say). Each step, it moves left or right, or stays. The number of distinct squares scanned is the number of unique positions the head has been to.

We need to determine whether this number is at least n.

How can we model this? Well, perhaps we can track the positions the head visits as we simulate M.

Each time the head moves, we can record the new positions. If the count reaches n, we can stop and return yes. If the head starts repeating positions without reaching n, then it's no.

Wait, but the problem is that M could run indefinitely without ever visiting n distinct squares. So, how can we know when to stop?

Alternatively, perhaps we can model this as a finite automaton. Since the machine is deterministic, each state and tape symbol combination can lead to a unique next state and action. So, if the machine enters a cycle without visiting n distinct squares, it will loop forever, and we can detect that.

Wait, but the number of states and tape symbols is finite. So, the number of possible configurations (state, tape symbol) is finite. So, if the machine runs beyond a certain number of steps without visiting n squares, it must have started repeating configurations, leading to a loop.

Wait, but the tape is infinite, so the configuration could change even if the state repeats, depending on the tape content.

Hmm, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Let me think differently.

Suppose we simulate M step by step, keeping track of all the tape positions the head has visited. Each time the head moves to a new position, we increment a counter. If the counter reaches n, we return yes. If the head starts moving in a way that it can't reach n new positions, we return no.

But how can we know when it's impossible to reach n new positions?

Well, if the head's movement is bounded, i.e., it only moves within a finite range of positions, then the number of new positions it can visit is limited. So, if after some steps, the head is moving in a cycle without exploring new positions, and the number of visited positions is less than n, then the answer is no.

But how can we detect that the head's movement is bounded?

Alternatively, perhaps we can model this by keeping track of the leftmost and rightmost positions the head has reached so far. If the head's movement doesn't extend beyond these points, then it's in a bounded region, and we can determine whether it can reach n positions.

But this might not capture all cases because the head could move left and right within a finite range but still visit new positions.

Wait, perhaps another approach: for problem III, the problem is equivalent to whether the head's path includes at least n distinct positions. Since the head's movement is determined by M's transition function, which is finite, perhaps we can model this as a finite automaton where each state includes the current position and the set of visited positions.

But the set of visited positions is potentially infinite, so that's not feasible.

Hmm, perhaps another way: the number of distinct positions the head can visit is countably infinite, but for any finite n, we can simulate until we've visited n positions or until the head starts looping without visiting new positions.

But how can we know when the head can't reach n positions?

Wait, perhaps we can use the pigeonhole principle. Since the machine has a finite number of states, and each step depends on the current state and the tape symbol, the machine must eventually repeat a state and a tape symbol, leading to a cycle.

So, if during the simulation, the number of visited positions doesn't reach n before the machine starts repeating states and tape symbols, then it will never reach n positions.

Therefore, we can simulate M, keeping track of all visited positions and the states and tape symbols encountered. Once a state and tape symbol repeat, we know the machine is in a cycle and will not visit any new positions beyond that point. At that point, if the number of visited positions is less than n, we can return no. Otherwise, yes.

So, problem III is decidable because we can simulate M until either we've visited n positions or a cycle is detected, in which case we can conclude whether we've reached n positions or not.

Wait, but the tape symbols can change, so the state and tape symbol combination must be considered. So, each time the head is at a position, the tape symbol there could be different, leading to different transitions.

But the key is that the number of possible (state, tape symbol) pairs is finite. So, if the machine repeats a (state, tape symbol, position) triplet, it's in a cycle and will not visit any new positions beyond that.

Wait, but the position could be part of the cycle, so the head might revisit the same positions in a loop without ever reaching n.

So, the plan is:

1. Simulate M step by step.

2. For each step, record the current position and the tape symbol at that position, along with the state.

3. Keep track of all positions visited so far.

4. If the number of visited positions reaches n, return yes.

5. If a state and tape symbol combination repeats at the same position, it indicates a cycle. At this point, no new positions will be visited, so if the count is less than n, return no.

6. If a state and tape symbol combination repeats but at a different position, it's more complex, but perhaps it's sufficient to consider that if the machine returns to a previous state and tape symbol at any position, it might be in a cycle that doesn't expand the visited positions.

Wait, but this might not capture all cases. For example, the machine could enter a cycle that moves between positions it's already visited, thus not adding new positions.

But in any case, the simulation can be stopped once a cycle is detected, and we can decide based on the number of visited positions so far.

Therefore, problem III is decidable.

Now, going back to problem II.

Problem II requires that both conditions are met: the computation runs for at least n steps, and after the nth step, M writes a 1.

We've determined that problem I is decidable. Now, the second condition is whether M writes a 1 at some point after the nth step.

But how can we model this? Let's think of it as a two-part problem:

1. Simulate M for n steps. If it halts before n steps, then condition I is not met, so problem II is no.

2. If M hasn't halted by step n, then we need to check whether, in the subsequent steps, M writes a 1.

But how can we check this? Because M could run indefinitely, and we can't simulate forever.

Wait, but perhaps we can model this as a modified Turing machine that, after step n, checks whether M writes a 1 before halting.

But again, this seems like it could be equivalent to the halting problem with an added condition, which is undecidable.

Alternatively, perhaps we can consider that after step n, M's behavior is such that it will either write a 1 before halting or not. But without knowing M's behavior, we can't determine this.

Wait, but perhaps the second condition can be rephrased as: after step n, M's computation doesn't terminate without writing a 1.

But that's not necessarily helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps we can model this as a reachability problem, where we need to determine whether there's a path in M's computation graph from the state after step n to a state where a 1 is written.

But again, this is similar to the halting problem and might be undecidable.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think about it another way.

Suppose we construct a new Turing machine M'' that runs M for n steps, then continues running M beyond that, and returns yes if a 1 is written after step n, and no otherwise.

But simulating this could take infinite time, making it impractical.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use a reduction to show that problem II is undecidable.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think of an example.

Suppose M is a machine that, on a blank tape, writes a 1 at position 0 and halts immediately. Then, for n=1, problem II would require that the computation runs at least 1 step (which it does) and that after step 1, M writes a 1. But in this case, M writes the 1 during step 1, so after step 1, there are no more steps. So, problem II would be no because after step 1, M has halted and didn't write any more 1s.

Wait, but that's a specific case. Let's think of another example.

Suppose M is a machine that, after n steps, starts writing 1s indefinitely. Then problem II would be yes.

But how can we decide this in general?

Wait, perhaps problem II is undecidable because it's equivalent to the halting problem with an added condition. Since the halting problem is undecidable, any problem that reduces to it is also undecidable.

Alternatively, perhaps problem II is decidable because we can simulate up to some point.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me try to model it.

Suppose we can simulate M for n steps. If it hasn't halted by then, we need to check whether any subsequent step writes a 1.

But how can we do that without simulating forever? We can't, unless we can find a finite point beyond which we can conclude that a 1 will or won't be written.

Wait, but perhaps we can model this as a finite automaton. After step n, the machine's state and the tape's content up to some point are known. Beyond that, the tape is blank. So, perhaps we can model the possible transitions and see if a 1 is written within a finite number of steps beyond n.

But this seems challenging because the tape is infinite, and the machine could write beyond any finite point.

Alternatively, perhaps we can consider that if after step n, M is in a state that can't write a 1, then the answer is no. Otherwise, yes.

But how can we determine that? It depends on M's transition function.

Wait, perhaps another approach: problem II can be rephrased as, does M, when run with a blank tape, write a 1 at some step after the nth step, assuming it hasn't halted before then.

But determining whether a 1 is written after step n is equivalent to determining whether M, starting from the configuration after step n, writes a 1 before halting.

If M halts without writing a 1 after step n, then the answer is no. If it writes a 1 before halting, the answer is yes. If it writes a 1 and then continues to run indefinitely, the answer is yes.

But how can we determine this? Because it's equivalent to solving the halting problem with a modified condition.

Hmm, perhaps problem II is undecidable because it's equivalent to the halting problem with an added condition. Since the halting problem is undecidable, problem II would also be undecidable.

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident. Let me think again.

Wait, problem I is decidable. Problem III is decidable. What about problem II?

Wait, perhaps problem II is decidable because we can simulate M beyond step n, but only up to a certain point. For example, if after step n, M writes a 1 within k steps, where k is some function of M and n, then we can decide yes. Otherwise, if it hasn't written a 1 within k steps, perhaps we can assume it won't.

But this approach would require knowing a bound on the steps beyond n, which I don't think we have.

Alternatively, perhaps problem II is reducible to the halting problem, making it undecidable.

Wait, but I'm not entirely certain. Let me think about the overall options.

The options are:

A: III only

B: II and III only

C: Only when M prints a 1 before nth step.

D: I only

E: All are decidable

F: I and II only

G: None

H: II only

I: I, II, III

J: I and III only

From earlier analysis, I'm leaning towards I and III being decidable, and II being undecidable.

Wait, but earlier I thought that problem II might be undecidable because it's similar to the halting problem with an added condition. So, perhaps II is undecidable.

Wait, but let me make sure. Let's think about the second condition: after step n, M writes a 1.

This is equivalent to: does M, starting from the state and tape configuration after step n, ever write a 1.

But the tape after step n could be anything, and M could be in any state.

But the key is that M is deterministic. So, from the state and tape configuration after step n, M's future behavior is determined.

Now, the question is whether, from that point, M will ever write a 1.

This seems like a variation of the halting problem, but specifically checking for a 1 being written.

But in the standard halting problem, we're checking whether M halts at all, regardless of what it writes.

In this case, we're checking whether M writes a 1 after step n.

But I'm not sure if this is reducible to the halting problem.

Wait, perhaps we can construct a reduction where we transform M into a new machine that writes a 1 if M halts. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps this problem is decidable.

Wait, another approach: the set of Turing machines that, after step n, write a 1 is decidable.

Wait, no, because it's possible that M runs forever without writing a 1 beyond step n.

So, perhaps problem II is undecidable.

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident. Let me think of it this way: problem II is a yes instance if and only if:

- M does not halt within n steps (so it runs at least n steps).

- After step n, M writes a 1 at some point before halting.

But if M never writes a 1 after step n, then the answer is no.

But how can we decide this? Because it's possible that M will write a 1 after any number of steps beyond n, or it might not.

This seems similar to the problem of determining whether a program will ever output a specific value, which is known to be undecidable in general.

Therefore, problem II is undecidable.

So, summarizing:

Problem I: Decidable.

Problem II: Undecidable.

Problem III: Decidable.

Therefore, the decidable problems are I and III.

Looking at the options, option J is I and III only.

So, the answer should be J.

The question involves determining which of the three problems (I, II, III) are decidable for a single-tape deterministic Turing machine \( M \) with a blank tape. Here's the analysis:

1. **Problem I**: The computation \( C \) lasts for at least \( n \) steps.  
   This problem is decidable because we can simulate \( M \) for \( n \) steps. If \( M \) halts before \( n \) steps, the answer is no. If it hasn't halted by \( n \) steps, the answer is yes. Simulation up to \( n \) steps is feasible, making this problem decidable.

2. **Problem II**: The computation \( C \) lasts for at least \( n \) steps, and \( M \) prints a 1 at some point after the \( n \)-th step.  
   This problem combines two conditions: (a) the computation lasts at least \( n \) steps, and (b) \( M \) prints a 1 after the \( n \)-th step. While the first condition is decidable, the second condition is equivalent to determining whether \( M \), starting from the state and tape configuration after \( n \) steps, will ever write a 1. This is similar to the halting problem with an added condition, which is undecidable. Therefore, Problem II is undecidable.

3. **Problem III**: \( M \) scans at least \( n \) distinct tape squares during the computation \( C \).  
   This problem is decidable. By simulating \( M \) and tracking the positions the head visits, we can count the distinct squares. If the count reaches \( n \), we return yes. If the head enters a cycle without visiting new positions, we can detect this by tracking repeated states and tape symbols, allowing us to conclude whether \( n \) distinct squares were visited.

In summary, Problems I and III are decidable, while Problem II is undecidable. The correct answer is:

**Answer: J**
