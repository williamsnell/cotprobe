Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a car with a worn-out suspension system. The question is asking for the frequency of oscillation when the car hits a bump and starts moving in simple harmonic motion (SHM). Hmm, I remember that SHM frequency is related to the spring constant and the mass involved, but let me think through this step by step.

Alright, the problem states that the car's mass is 1000 kg, and a person weighing 980 N climbs into the car. So first, maybe I should find the total mass of the system when the person is inside. Wait, the person's weight is given in Newtons, so I need to convert that into mass. Oh right, weight equals mass times gravity, so mass is weight divided by g. Let's calculate that.

So, the person's mass m_p = 980 N / 9.8 m/s². Let me do the math: 980 divided by 9.8. Hmm, 9.8 times 100 is 980, so that's 100 kg. Oh, that's a big person! But okay, moving on.

The total mass of the car and person together is the car's mass plus the person's mass. So 1000 kg + 100 kg = 1100 kg. Got that down.

Next, the car sinks 2.8 cm when the person gets in. I think this displacement relates to the spring constant of the car's suspension. Since the car is modeled as a single mass on a spring, the spring constant can be found using Hooke's Law. Hooke's Law says F = kx, where F is the force applied, k is the spring constant, and x is the displacement.

Wait, the force here is the weight of the person, right? Because when they sit in the car, their weight causes the car to compress the spring by 2.8 cm. So F = 980 N, x is 2.8 cm. Oh, but I need to convert that to meters for SI units. 2.8 cm is 0.028 meters.

So plugging into Hooke's Law: 980 N = k * 0.028 m. Solving for k, k = 980 / 0.028. Let me calculate that. 980 divided by 0.028. Hmm, 0.028 times 35,000 is 980 because 0.028 * 10,000 is 280, so 280 * 35 is 9800, wait no, maybe a better way. Alternatively, 980 / 0.028 is the same as 980 * (1/0.028). 1/0.028 is approximately 35.714. So 980 * 35.714 ≈ let's see, 980 * 35 is 34,300, and 980 * 0.714 is about 700, so adding them gives around 35,000. So k is roughly 35,000 N/m. Wait, more accurately, 980 ÷ 0.028 is exactly 35,000. Yeah, because 0.028 times 35,000 is 980. So k = 35,000 N/m.

Now, the frequency of SHM is given by the formula f = (1/(2π)) * sqrt(k/m), where m is the total mass. So plugging in the values, k is 35,000 N/m and m is 1100 kg.

Let me compute the square root part first. sqrt(k/m) = sqrt(35,000 / 1100). Let's compute that division: 35,000 / 1100. Dividing both numerator and denominator by 100, it's 350 / 11. 350 divided by 11 is approximately 31.818, because 11 * 31 is 341, and 11*31.818 is about 350. So sqrt(31.818) is around 5.64, because 5.64 squared is about 31.8 (since 5.6^2 is 31.36, and 5.64^2 is 31.8). So the square root is approximately 5.64.

Then, f = (1/(2π)) * 5.64. Let me calculate 1/(2π). 2π is about 6.283, so 1/6.283 is approximately 0.159. Multiply that by 5.64: 0.159 * 5.64. Let's see, 0.159 * 5 is 0.795, 0.159 * 0.64 is about 0.102. So total is approximately 0.795 + 0.102 = 0.897 Hz. Hmm, that's about 0.9 Hz.

Wait, looking at the options, J is 0.9. So maybe that's the answer. But wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

Wait, the total mass is 1100 kg? Oh, 1000 + 100 is 1100, yes. The displacement was 0.028 m, correct. So k = F/x = 980 N / 0.028 m = 35,000 N/m, correct. Then the frequency: f = (1/(2π)) * sqrt(k/m) = (1/(2π)) * sqrt(35000/1100).

Wait, let me compute 35000 / 1100 again. 35000 divided by 1100: 35000 / 1100 = 350 / 11 ≈31.818. So sqrt(31.818) is about 5.64, as before. Then 5.64 / (2π) is 5.64 /6.283 ≈0.897, which is about 0.9 Hz. So the answer should be J: 0.9.

Wait, but looking at the options, option J is 0.9. So that's the choice.

The problem involves finding the frequency of oscillation of a car with a worn-out suspension system when it hits a bump. The car and person are modeled as a single mass-spring system. 

1. **Convert the person's weight to mass**:  
   The person's weight is 980 N, so their mass is calculated as:  
   \[
   m_p = \frac{980 \, \text{N}}{9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2} = 100 \, \text{kg}.
   \]

2. **Total mass of the system**:  
   The car's mass is 1000 kg, so the total mass with the person is:  
   \[
   m_{\text{total}} = 1000 \, \text{kg} + 100 \, \text{kg} = 1100 \, \text{kg}.
   \]

3. **Determine the spring constant \(k\)**:  
   The car sinks 2.8 cm (0.028 m) under the person's weight. Using Hooke's Law (\(F = kx\)):  
   \[
   k = \frac{F}{x} = \frac{980 \, \text{N}}{0.028 \, \text{m}} = 35,000 \, \text{N/m}.
   \]

4. **Calculate the frequency of oscillation**:  
   The frequency of SHM is given by:  
   \[
   f = \frac{1}{2\pi} \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}.
   \]  
   Substituting \(k = 35,000 \, \text{N/m}\) and \(m = 1100 \, \text{kg}\):  
   \[
   f = \frac{1}{2\pi} \sqrt{\frac{35,000}{1100}}.
   \]  
   Simplify the division:  
   \[
   \frac{35,000}{1100} \approx 31.818.
   \]  
   Take the square root:  
   \[
   \sqrt{31.818} \approx 5.64.
   \]  
   Finally, calculate the frequency:  
   \[
   f = \frac{1}{2\pi} \cdot 5.64 \approx \frac{5.64}{6.283} \approx 0.897 \, \text{Hz}.
   \]  
   This rounds to approximately \(0.9 \, \text{Hz}\).
