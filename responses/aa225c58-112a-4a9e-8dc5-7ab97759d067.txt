Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the rotating mirror experiment to measure the speed of light. Hmm, I remember that this experiment was used by someone like Fizeau or Foucault to calculate the speed of light. Let me think about how it works.

The setup is that there's a rotating mirror, probably with multiple faces, and a light source. The light reflects off the rotating mirror and then goes to another mirror, which is some distance away. Then it comes back and reflects again off the rotating mirror. The idea is that when the mirror rotates at a certain speed, the light beam is shifted, but in this case, there's no shift, meaning it's probably when the rotational speed causes the light to return just right to catch up with the mirror's rotation.

Wait, the problem says that when the 8-face mirror rotates at 530 rps (rotations per second), no shift of the light source is obtained. So no shift implies that the light's path aligns perfectly with the mirror's rotation after a certain time. That probably means the time it takes for the light to go to the distant mirror and come back equals the time it takes for the mirror to rotate a certain number of times.

Let me think about the formula. I think the key is to find the condition where the light's round trip time equals the period of the mirror's rotation for one of its faces. Since it's an 8-face mirror, each face would be spaced at 45 degrees (360/8 = 45). So each face comes into position every 1/8 of a rotation.

Wait, no, the rotation speed is 530 rps. So each rotation is 1/530 seconds per rotation. But since the mirror has 8 faces, each face is encountered every 1/(8*530) seconds? Or maybe the time between each face passing a certain point is 1/(8*530) seconds.

Wait, maybe the correct approach is to consider that for the light to return and hit the same face again, the total time for the light to make a round trip must equal the time it takes for the mirror to rotate an integer number of times. Because if the mirror rotates, say, N times during the light's round trip, then the same face would be in position again.

So, the general formula would be: time for light to go to the mirror and back = (distance one way is 35377 meters, so round trip is 2*35377) divided by speed of light, c. This time should equal the time it takes for the mirror to rotate N times. So, time = N / f, where f is 530 rps.

Wait, f is 530 Hz (rotations per second). So the time for N rotations is N/f. So the equation is:

(2 * distance) / c = N / f

But what's N here? Since the mirror has 8 faces, the light has to catch up with the same face after the mirror has rotated an integer number of times. So N would be 1, 2, 3, etc. But I think the minimal case is when N is 1, meaning the mirror rotates once while the light makes the round trip. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, no, because the mirror is rotating, and the light has to catch up with the next face. So perhaps each time the mirror rotates 1/8 of a full turn, the light would hit the next face. So maybe the number of rotations is a fraction, like 1/8 of a rotation. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Let me try to structure this. The idea is that the light leaves the source, goes to the distant mirror, and then comes back. During this time, the mirror has rotated, so the light must hit the next face that comes into position. So the total time for the round trip must equal the time it takes for the mirror to rotate a certain number of steps.

Wait, another approach: The mirror is rotating at angular velocity ω, which is 2π * f. The time for the light to go to the distant mirror and back is T = (2 * D) / c, where D is the distance, 35377 meters.

During this time T, the mirror rotates by an angle θ = ω * T. For the light to return to the same face, θ must be an integer multiple of 2π, because the mirror has multiple faces. Or perhaps more accurately, θ must be an integer multiple of the angle between each face, which is 2π/8 = π/4 radians.

Wait, perhaps the condition is that θ = (2π) * k, where k is the number of full rotations. So the time T must equal the time for k full rotations, which is T = k / f. So:

(2D)/c = k / f

But also, θ = ω * T = 2π f * (2D/c) )= 2π f * (2D/c) ) = (4π D f) / c.

But for the light to hit the same face, θ must be an integer multiple of 2π. So:

(4π D f) / c = 2π m, where m is an integer.

Simplifying, this gives:

(2 D f) / c = m.

So, m = (2 D f) / c.

But m must be an integer. Since we're looking for c, rearranged:

c = (2 D f) / m.

But m must be an integer. We can choose the smallest m that makes sense. Since f is 530 rps, D is 35377 m.

Wait, but perhaps m is 8, because the mirror has 8 faces, so each face is spaced by 45 degrees. So for the light to return to the same face, the mirror must rotate by 360 degrees, which is 8 steps of 45 degrees each. So m would be 8.

Wait, no, maybe m is 1. Let me think again. If the mirror is rotating at 530 rps, and the light takes T seconds to make the round trip, then the number of rotations during that time is N = f * T. For the light to hit the same face, the number of rotations N must be such that the light aligns with the next face. So if the mirror has 8 faces, each face comes into position every 1/8 of a rotation. So N must be an integer multiple of 1/8.

Wait, that might not be right. Let me try a different approach. The light goes to the distant mirror and back. The time taken is T = 2D/c. During this time, the mirror rotates, so the number of rotations is f * T. For the light to return to the same face, f * T must be an integer. So f * T = integer. So T = n / f, where n is an integer.

But T is 2D/c, so:

2D/c = n / f → c = (2 D f) / n.

Now, n must be an integer. The minimal n is 1, but that would give a very high c. Let's see what happens. Plugging in the numbers:

D = 35377 m

f = 530 rps

n = 1 → c = (2 * 35377 * 530) / 1 = let's calculate that.

2 * 35377 = 70754

70754 * 530 = let's compute.

70,754 * 500 = 35,377,000

70,754 * 30 = 2,122,620

Total = 35,377,000 + 2,122,620 = 37,500,  I think wait:

Wait, 70754 * 530 = 70754 * (500 + 30) = 70754*500= 35,377,000; 70754*30=2,122,620. Sum is 35,377,000 + 2,122,620 = 37,499,620 m/s.

That's way higher than the known speed of light, which is about 3.0e8 m/s. So n=1 can't be right. So perhaps n is 8, because there are 8 faces.

Wait, let me compute n=8.

c = (2 * 35377 * 530) /8.

Calculating numerator: 2 *35377=70754 *530=37,499,620 as before.

Divide by 8: 37,499,620 /8 = 4,687,452.5 m/s. Still too high. Hmm, this can't be right.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the approach. Let me check.

Another way: the condition is that the light's round trip time equals the time it takes for the mirror to rotate such that the light returns to the same face. Since there are 8 faces, the rotation angle needed is 360 degrees, which is 2π radians. So, the time T for the light's round trip must equal the time for the mirror to rotate 2π radians. But the angular speed ω is 2π*f. So the time to rotate 2π is T = 2π / (2π f) ) = 1/f seconds.

Wait, that makes T = 1/f. So T = 1/530 ≈ 0.00188679 seconds.

But T is also equal to 2D/c. So:

2D/c = 1/f → c = 2 D f.

So c = 2 * 35377 m * 530 rps.

Wait, that's a huge number. Let me compute that.

35377 * 2 = 70754.

70754 * 530 = let's compute:

70754 * 500 = 35,377,000.

70754 * 30 = 2,122,620.

Sum is 35,377,000 + 2,122,620 = 37,499,620 m/s. That's way higher than the known speed of light, which is about 3e8 m/s. So this approach must be wrong.

Wait, perhaps I got the condition wrong. Maybe the time for the light's trip is equal to the time it takes for the mirror to rotate 1/8 of a full rotation because each face is 45 degrees apart. So the time T would be the time for the mirror to rotate 45 degrees, which is (45/360) of one full rotation period.

The period of rotation is 1/f seconds. So time to rotate 45 degrees is (45/360) * (1/f) = (1/8) * (1/530) ≈ 0.0002358 seconds.

So T = 2D/c = (1/8)/530.

Wait, no, that's 0.0002358 s.

So 2D/c = 1/(8*530) → c = 2D *8*530.

So c = 2 * 35377 *8 *530.

Wait, that's 35377 * 2 = 70754; 70754 *8=566,032; 566,032 *530= ?

Let me compute 566,032 * 500 = 283,016,000 and 566,032 *30=16,980,960. Sum is 283,016,000 +16,980,960 = 300,  (Wait, 283,016,000 + 16,980,960 = 300, 0,  (Wait: 283,016,000 + 16,980,960 = 299,996,960 m/s. Again, way too high.

Hmm, I'm getting conflicting results. Maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me look for another formula or approach.

I think I remember that in the rotating mirror method, the condition is that the light's round trip time equals the time for the mirror to rotate a certain number of teeth. So, the formula is often written as c = (2 D N f) / k, where N is the number of faces and k is an integer. Wait, perhaps not exactly. Alternatively, I've seen the formula expressed as c = (2 D f N) / m, where m is the order.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is c = (2 D f N) / (m), where N is the number of faces and m is an integer. Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, another approach: the light makes a round trip, and during that time, the mirror has rotated by an angle that brings the same face back into position. So, the angle rotated is 2π radians times the number of rotations. For the light to return to the same face, the angle must be a multiple of 2π.

So, the time for the light's trip is T = (2 D)/c.

The angular displacement during T is ω T = 2π f T.

This must equal 2π m, where m is the number of full rotations. So:

2π f T = 2π m → f T = m → T = m/f.

But T is also (2 D)/c, so:

(2 D)/c = m/f → c = (2 D f)/m.

Now, m must be an integer. Let's try m=1.

c = (2 * 35377 *530)/1 = 37,499,620 m/s. As before, way too high.

Wait, but the known speed of light is about 3e8 m/s, so perhaps m should be 12. Let me try m=12. Then:

c = (2 *35377 *530)/12 ≈ (37,499,620)/12 ≈ 3,124,968 m/s, which is about 3.12e6 m/s, still too low.

Wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating. Let me compute 2*35377=70,754. Then 70,754 *530=37,499,620. Then 37,499,620 / m. Let me try m=8.

37,499,620 /8=4,687,452.5 m/s. Still way too high.

Wait, what's another approach? Maybe the formula is c = (2 D f) / (n), where n is the number of faces. So n=8.

So c = (2 *35377 *530)/8 ≈ (70754 *530)/8 = (37,499,620)/8 ≈4,687,452.5 m/s. No, that's still too high.

Hmm, perhaps I'm using the wrong formula. Maybe the correct formula is c = (2 D f) * (number of faces) / (1 - (v_mirror/c)), but that seems more complicated.

Wait, perhaps another way. The rotating mirror method is such that when the mirror is rotating, the light beam is Doppler shifted. But no, perhaps not. Alternatively, the condition for resonance is that the time for the light to go to the mirror and back equals the time for the mirror to rotate by an angle that brings the same face into position.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is c = (2 D f) / (m), where m is the number of face passes. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is c = (2 D f) / (1 - (v/c)), but that seems more like the Fizeau–Foucault experiment, where the speed of light in water is measured considering the rotation.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think differently. The problem states that when the mirror rotates at 530 rps, no shift is obtained. That probably means that the light returns to the same face, so the light's round trip time must be such that the mirror has rotated an integer number of steps. Since there are 8 faces, each face is every 1/8 of a rotation.

So, the time for the light to make the round trip is T = 2D/c.

During this time, the mirror rotates by f*T rotations. For the light to hit the same face, f*T must be an integer multiple of 1/8, because each face is 1/8 of a rotation apart.

So, f*T = k * (1/8), where k is an integer.

So, T = (k / (8 f)).

But T is also 2D/c, so:

2D/c = k/(8 f) → c = (2 D * 8 f ) / k.

We can choose k=1 for the minimal case. So c = (2*35377 *8 *530)/1.

Calculating:

2 *35377 =70754.

70754 *8=566,032.

566,032 *530=?

Let me compute:

566,032 *500=283,016,000.

566,032 *30=16,980,960.

Adding them gives 283,016,000 +16,980,960 = 300, (wait, 283,016,000 +16,980,960 = 299,996,960).

So c=299,996,960 m/s. That's way higher than the known speed of light, which is about 3e8 m/s. So this can't be right.

Wait, I must have made a mistake. Let me check the approach again.

Alternative approach: The condition for no shift is that the light's round trip time equals the time it takes for the mirror to rotate an integer number of steps. Each step is 1/8 of a rotation because there are 8 faces.

So, time for light's round trip: T = 2D/c.

Number of rotations during T: N = f * T.

For no shift, N must be an integer. Because each face is 1/8 of a rotation apart, N = k * (1/8), where k is an integer.

So, f * (2D/c) = k/8 → c = (2 D *8 f)/k.

If I take k=1, then c=(2*35377*8*530)/1 = 299,996,960 m/s, which is way too high.

But the known speed of light is about 3e8 m/s, which is 300,000,000 m/s. Oh wait, that's very close to what I just calculated. 299,996,960 is approximately 3e8. So perhaps this is the correct approach, and the answer is approximately 3e8 m/s.

Looking at the options, option B is 3.00 ×10^8 m/s, which matches.

So the calculation gives c ≈ 3e8 m/s, which is option B.
</think>

To calculate the speed of light using the rotating mirror experiment, we analyze the setup where the light source reflects off an 8-face rotating mirror, which is set to rotate at 530 rps (rotations per second). The distant mirror is located 35377 meters away. The condition for no shift in the light source implies that the light's round trip time aligns perfectly with the mirror's rotation, such that the light returns to the same face of the rotating mirror.

The time for the light to make a round trip is given by:

\[
T = \frac{2D}{c}
\]

where \(D = 35377 \, \text{m}\) is the one-way distance, and \(c\) is the speed of light. During this time, the mirror rotates, and the number of rotations is:

\[
N = f \cdot T
\]

where \(f = 530 \, \text{Hz}\) is the rotation frequency. For the light to return to the same face, \(N\) must be an integer multiple of \(\frac{1}{8}\), since the mirror has 8 faces. Thus:

\[
f \cdot \frac{2D}{c} = \frac{k}{8}
\]

where \(k\) is an integer. Rearranging for \(c\):

\[
c = \frac{2D \cdot 8f}{k}
\]

Taking \(k = 1\) for the minimal case:

\[
c = \frac{2 \cdot 35377 \cdot 8 \cdot 530}{1}
\]

First, calculate the numerator:

\[
2 \cdot 35377 = 70754
\]

\[
70754 \cdot 8 = 566032
\]

\[
566032 \cdot 530 = 299,996,960 \, \text{m/s}
\]

This value is approximately \(3.00 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}\), which matches the known speed of light. Comparing with the options, the closest match is:

**B: \(3.00 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}\)**

Answer: B
