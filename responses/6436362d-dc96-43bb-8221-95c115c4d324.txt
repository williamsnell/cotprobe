Okay, so I've got this problem here about finding the number of moles of hydrogen gas in a steel cylinder. Let me think through it step by step.

Alright, the problem gives me the volume, pressure, and temperature. I remember from chemistry that the ideal gas law is probably what I need here. The ideal gas law is PV = nRT, right? So P is pressure, V is volume, n is the number of moles, R is the gas constant, and T is temperature in Kelvin.

First, I should note the given values. The volume V is 50 liters. The pressure P is 10 atmospheres. The temperature T is 27°C, but wait, I think I need to convert that to Kelvin because the gas constant R is given in terms of Kelvin. To convert Celsius to Kelvin, I add 273. So 27°C plus 273 is 300 K. Got it.

Now, R is given as 0.082 liter-atm/(mole·°K). That matches the units of P and V, so I don't need to worry about unit conversions there. Perfect.

So plugging the values into PV = nRT, I can solve for n. Let me rearrange the formula to solve for n: n = PV / (RT). 

Calculating each part:
- P is 10 atm.
- V is 50 L.
- R is 0.082.
- T is 300 K.

So, PV is 10 * 50 = 500. Then RT is 0.082 * 300. Let me compute that: 0.082 * 300 equals... 0.082 times 300, so 0.082 * 3 is 0.246, and with two more zeros because 300 is three zeros after 3, so 24.6. So RT is 24.6.

Now, n = 500 / 24.6. Let me do that division. 500 divided by 24.6. Hmm, 24.6 times 20 is 492. So 20 would give 492, and 500 - 492 is 8. So 8 left, which is 8/24.6 ≈ 0.325. So total is approximately 20.325. So about 20.3 moles.

Looking at the options, option A is 20 moles. That seems close enough, especially since we might have rounded some numbers. Let me double-check my calculations to be sure.

Wait, 0.082 * 300: 0.08 *300 is 24, and 0.002*300 is 0.6, so 24 + 0.6 =24.6. Correct. PV is 10 *50=500. So 500/24.6 is indeed approximately 20.3. So yeah, the closest option is 20 moles, which is option A.

Using the ideal gas law \( PV = nRT \), we calculate the number of moles \( n \) as \( n = \frac{PV}{RT} \). Substituting the given values: \( P = 10 \) atm, \( V = 50 \) L, \( R = 0.082 \) L·atm/(mol·K), and \( T = 300 \) K, we find \( n \approx 20 \) moles. 

Answer: A
