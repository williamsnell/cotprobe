Alright, I'm trying to figure out which option improves normal memory. Let's go through each choice one by one.

Option A: Sleeping less hours per night. I remember that sleep is important for memory consolidation. So if you sleep less, maybe your memory isn't as good. That doesn't seem right, so probably not A.

Option B: Decreasing physical activity. Exercise is often linked to brain health. I think aerobic exercise, like running or cycling, is good for the brain, so decreasing activity might be bad. So B might not be the answer.

Option C: Taking melatonin supplements. Melatonin helps with sleep, and better sleep can improve memory. But I'm not sure if taking supplements is better than just getting enough sleep naturally. Not sure yet, so I'll keep this in mind.

Option D: Aerobic exercise. As I thought earlier, aerobic exercise is known to boost brain health and improve memory. Studies show it increases blood flow and can help with cognitive functions. This sounds like a strong candidate.

Option E: Isolating oneself from social activities. Social interaction is good for mental health and can help keep the mind sharp. Isolating might lead to worse memory, so E is probably not the answer.

Option F: Drinking more caffeine. Caffeine can help with alertness and focus, but too much might cause issues like anxiety or disrupted sleep, which could harm memory. So F might not be the best choice.

Option G: Taking gingko. Gingko is an herb sometimes used for memory, but I'm not sure how effective it is. I think the evidence might be mixed, so G could be a possibility, but not certain.

Option H: Taking acetylcholine. Acetylcholine is a neurotransmitter involved in memory. I remember that some Alzheimer's medications target this, but taking supplements might not be effective because the body regulates it. So H might not be the answer.

Option I: Eating more sugary foods. Sugar can cause energy spikes and crashes, which might impair cognitive functions. Plus, too much sugar isn't good for overall health, so I don't think I is correct.

So, looking back, D: Aerobic exercise seems the best option because it's well-supported by research as being beneficial for memory and brain health. The others either have mixed evidence or are more likely to have negative effects.

The answer is D: Aerobic exercise. Aerobic exercise is known to enhance memory and cognitive function by increasing blood flow and promoting neural growth.

Answer: D
