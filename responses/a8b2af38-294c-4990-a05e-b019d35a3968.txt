Okay, so James took a loan of $240 for 30 days at 6% interest. I need to figure out how much interest he has to pay. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.

First, I remember that interest can be calculated using the simple interest formula, which is I = P * R * T. I think P is the principal amount, R is the rate of interest, and T is the time in years. But wait, the time here is given in days, so I'll need to convert that into years.

The principal P is $240. The rate R is 6%, but I need to convert that percentage into a decimal for the calculation. So 6% as a decimal is 0.06. Now, the time T is 30 days, but since the interest rate is usually annual, I should convert days to years. There are 365 days in a year, so 30 days is 30/365 years. Let me calculate that: 30 divided by 365 is approximately 0.08219 years.

Putting it all into the formula: I = 240 * 0.06 * (30/365). Let me compute each part step by step. 

First, 240 multiplied by 0.06. 240 * 0.06 is 14.4. Now, multiply that by 30/365. So 14.4 * (30/365). Let me compute 30 divided by 365 first. 30 ÷ 365 is approximately 0.08219. So 14.4 multiplied by 0.08219. Let me do this multiplication. 

14.4 * 0.08 is 1.152, and 14.4 * 0.00219 is about 0.031536. Adding them together gives approximately 1.1835. So the interest would be roughly $1.18. Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see exactly $1.18. The closest options are J: $1.20 and I: $1.80. Hmm, maybe I should check my calculations again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the multiplication. Let me try another approach. Instead of converting days to years, maybe I can calculate the daily interest rate and then multiply by 30 days. The annual rate is 6%, so the daily rate is 6% divided by 365. That would be 0.06 / 365 ≈ 0.00016438 per day. Then, the interest for 30 days is 240 * 0.00016438 * 30.

Let me compute that. 0.00016438 multiplied by 30 is approximately 0.0049314. Then, 240 multiplied by 0.0049314 is about 1.1835, which again is around $1.18. So that's still about $1.18.

Looking at the options again, the closest is J: $1.20. So maybe the answer is J. But wait, another way to think about it: sometimes, interest is calculated using 360 days in a year for simplicity, especially in finance. Let me try that. So if I use 360 days instead of 365, the daily rate would be 0.06 / 360 = 0.00016667 per day. Then, 30 days would be 30 * 0.00016667 ≈ 0.005 per day. Then, 240 * 0.005 = $1.20. That's exactly option J.

So maybe the correct answer is J: $1.20. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects using simple interest without converting days to years, but that doesn't make sense because interest rates are typically annual. But let's see, if I didn't convert days and just used 30 days as is, that would be wrong because the rate is 6% per annum. So the correct approach is to convert the time into years, either by 365 or 360 days, and in this case, using 360 gives exactly $1.20, which is one of the options.

Wait, but maybe the problem is using a different method. Let me check the options again. The options are A: $0.36, B: $14.40, C: $3.60, D: $2.40, E: $7.20, F: $12.00, G: $0.60, H: $4.80, I: $1.80, J: $1.20.

Wait a second, another approach: maybe the interest is calculated as a simple interest without considering the time in years. Let's see, 6% of 240 is 14.4, and over 30 days, maybe they're considering a 30-day period as a fraction of a year, but perhaps using 12 months in a year, each month as 30 days. So 30 days is 1/12 of a year. So then, interest would be 240 * 0.06 * (1/12). Let's compute that: 240 * 0.06 = 14.4, and 14.4 * (1/12) = 1.2. So that's $1.20, which is option J.

Yes, that makes sense. So the correct answer is J: $1.20.

The interest is calculated using simple interest formula. Converting the annual rate to a monthly rate since 30 days is 1/12 of a year. Interest = $240 * 6% * (1/12) = $1.20.

Answer: J
