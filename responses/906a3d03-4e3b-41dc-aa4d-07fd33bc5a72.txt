Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a car's drum brakes. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll give it a shot.

The problem says the driver applies brakes, slowing down at a constant rate of 25 fps² until it stops. The car weighs 3500 lbs, average speed is 55 mph, and the drum diameter is 10 inches. The band face width and thickness are 2 inches and 1/4 inch respectively. I need to find (a) temperature increase in the drum, (b) mean power absorption rate in the first second, and (c) average power absorbed overall.

First, let me list out what I know. The car is decelerating at 25 fps², which is a pretty high deceleration. The weight is 3500 lbs, so I might need to convert that to mass in slugs because in the English system, mass is in slugs. Weight in pounds divided by g (32.2 ft/s²) gives mass in slugs.

Wait, but maybe I can work with pounds and other units as needed. Let me think about each part.

Starting with part (a): Temperature increase in the drum due to heat absorption.

Heat generated in the brakes would come from the work done by the friction between the brake drum and the band. The work done is the force applied by the brakes times the distance over which it's applied. Alternatively, since the car is slowing down, the kinetic energy is being converted into heat.

So, first, I should calculate the kinetic energy of the car and see how much of that is dissipated as heat in the brakes. Then, using the specific heat capacity of the drum material, I can find the temperature rise.

But wait, I don't know the material of the drum. Hmm, maybe I can assume it's steel. The specific heat capacity of steel is around 0.11 Btu per pound per degree Fahrenheit. Wait, is that right? Or maybe I should look it up. Alternatively, sometimes in these problems, they assume a certain value, like 0.1 Btu/(lb·°F) or similar. I'll proceed with that assumption.

So first, let's find the initial kinetic energy. The car's mass is 3500 lbs. Wait, but that's weight, so mass m = weight / g, where g is 32.2 ft/s². So m = 3500 / 32.2 ≈ 108.696 slugs.

Kinetic energy KE = 0.5 * m * v². But the speed is given as 55 mph, which I need to convert to feet per second. 55 mph is 55 * 5280 ft / 3600 s ≈ 15.133 ft/s.

So KE = 0.5 * 108.696 slug * (15.133 ft/s)^2. Let me calculate that:

15.133 squared is about 228.978. Multiply by 108.696 and then by 0.5.

0.5 * 108.696 ≈54.348. 54.348 * 228.978 ≈ around 12,450 ft·lbf.

Wait, ft·lbf is a unit of work. Since 1 Btu is about 778 ft·lbf, the KE in Btu would be 12450 / 778 ≈ 16.02 Btu.

So the total kinetic energy is about 16 Btu. That's the energy that's being dissipated as heat in the brakes.

But wait, the problem is about the drum's temperature rise. So the heat is absorbed by the drum. I need to find the mass of the drum to calculate the temperature rise. But the problem doesn't give the drum's mass. Hmm, that's a problem. Maybe I can assume a standard drum mass? Or perhaps the problem expects me to calculate based on the surface area and other given dimensions.

Wait, the drum diameter is 10 inches, so radius is 5 inches. The face width is 2 inches, and thickness is 0.25 inches. So the volume of the drum can be approximated as the area of the circular cross-section times the width. But wait, the drum's volume would be the area of the annulus if it's a hollow drum, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the drum is solid, so the volume is πr²h, where h is the width. But wait, the thickness is 0.25 inches, so perhaps the width is 2 inches, and the radius is 5 inches. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the mass of the drum is negligible compared to the car's mass, so maybe the heat is entirely absorbed by the drum. But without the drum's mass, I can't compute the temperature rise. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the problem expects me to consider the heat generated per unit time, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the work done by the brakes, which is the force times the distance. Alternatively, since the car is decelerating, the work done is the initial kinetic energy. So W = ΔKE = 12,450 ft·lbf.

Assuming all of this goes into heating the drum. Let me say the drum's mass is m_d, specific heat c, then ΔT = W/(m_d * c). But without m_d, I can't proceed. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects me to find the power absorbed and then find the temperature rise from that, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I'm supposed to find the power first and then integrate it over time to find the total energy, then find the temperature rise. Let me think about part (c) first, perhaps.

Part (c) is the average power absorbed overall. Power is work per unit time. The average power would be the total work done (kinetic energy) divided by the time it takes to stop.

So I need to find the time it takes for the car to stop under a deceleration of 25 fps². The initial velocity is 15.133 ft/s, deceleration a = 25 ft/s². Time t = v_initial / a = 15.133 /25 ≈ 0.605 seconds.

So the average power P_avg = KE / t = 12450 ft·lbf / 0.605 s ≈ 20580 ft·lbf/s. Since 1 hp is 550 ft·lbf/s, so 20580 / 550 ≈ 37.4 hp. But looking at the options, none have an average power around 37 hp. Wait, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, the car's average speed is 55 mph during braking. Wait, is that the initial speed? Because the average speed during constant deceleration is (v_initial + v_final)/2 = v_initial / 2. So if the average speed is 55 mph, then the initial speed would be 110 mph. But that doesn't make sense because the car comes to rest. So maybe the problem says the average speed during braking is 55 mph, which would make the initial speed 110 mph. Wait, that's a big difference. Hmm.

Wait, the problem says "average speed is 55 mph." So perhaps the initial speed is higher, and the average is 55. Let me recalculate.

Wait, if the average speed is 55 mph, which is 55 * 5280 / 3600 ≈ 15.133 ft/s, as I calculated earlier. But if the average speed is 55 mph, then the initial speed would be higher. Let me think: average speed during constant deceleration is (v_initial + 0)/2 = v_initial/2. So if the average speed is 55 mph, then v_initial is 110 mph. That's 110 * 5280 ft/mile / 3600 s/hour ≈ 307.333 ft/s.

Wait, that's a very high speed. Let me check the question again. It says the average speed is 55 mph. So perhaps I should take v_initial as 55 mph, but that would make the average speed 27.5 mph. Hmm, that doesn't add up. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Alternatively, perhaps the average speed is 55 mph, so the time taken to stop is based on that speed.

Wait, maybe I should re-express the problem correctly. Let me start over.

Problem data:

- Deceleration (a) = 25 fps²
- Weight (W) = 3500 lbs → mass m = 3500 / 32.2 ≈ 108.696 slugs
- Average speed = 55 mph → convert to ft/s: 55 * 5280 / 3600 ≈ 15.133 ft/s
- Drum diameter = 10 in → radius r = 5 in = 0.4167 ft
- Band face width = 2 inches = 1/6 ft
- Band thickness = 1/4 inch = 0.0208 ft

Wait, but I'm not sure how the band's dimensions affect the power calculation. Maybe the area of contact is involved in calculating the friction force.

Wait, perhaps the power is related to the rate at which work is done, which is force times velocity. The force would be the braking force, which is mass times deceleration.

So braking force F = m * a = 108.696 slugs * 25 ft/s² ≈ 2717.4 lb.

Then, power P = F * v_avg. The average velocity is 15.133 ft/s, so P = 2717.4 * 15.133 ≈ 41100 ft·lbf/s. Convert to hp: 41100 / 550 ≈ 74.7 hp. But looking at the options, the average power is around 140-220 hp. Hmm, that's lower than the options. Maybe I'm missing something here.

Wait, perhaps I'm not considering the entire kinetic energy. Let me compute the time taken to stop. Using v = u + at, where final v = 0, initial u = 15.133 ft/s, a = -25 ft/s².

So 0 = 15.133 -25t → t ≈ 0.605 seconds.

The total work done is KE = 0.5 * m * u² = 0.5 * 108.696 * (15.133)^2 ≈ 0.5 * 108.696 * 228.97 ≈ 12450 ft·lbf.

Average power P_avg = 12450 / 0.605 ≈ 20580 ft·lbf/s → 20580 /550 ≈ 37.4 hp. Hmm, but the options don't have this value. So maybe I'm making a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the average speed is 55 mph, which is 15.133 ft/s, but the initial speed is higher. Wait, if average speed is 55 mph, then initial speed would be double that, 110 mph. Let me recalculate.

110 mph is 110 *5280 /3600 ≈ 154.667 ft/s.

Then, time to stop t = 154.667 /25 ≈ 6.187 seconds.

KE = 0.5 * m * u² = 0.5 * 108.696 * (154.667)^2 ≈ 0.5 * 108.696 * 23924 ≈ 0.5 * 108.696 *23924 ≈ let's compute 108.696 *23924 ≈ around 2,580,000. Then half of that is 1,290,000 ft·lbf.

Average power P_avg = 1,290,000 /6.187 ≈ 208,600 ft·lbf/s → 208600 /550 ≈ 380.2 hp. Hmm, but this is way higher than the options, which go up to 220 hp. So perhaps this approach is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing average speed. The problem says average speed is 55 mph. So perhaps the car's initial speed is 55 mph, and the average speed during braking is lower. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the average speed is the average over the entire braking distance, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the work done by the brakes as the force times the distance traveled during braking. Let's compute the stopping distance first. Using v² = u² + 2as. Since final v is 0, s = u²/(2a). So s = (15.133)^2/(2*25) ≈ 228.978 /50 ≈ 4.5795 ft.

Then, work done W = F * s = 2717.4 lb *4.5795 ft ≈ 12450 ft·lbf, same as KE. So the average power is W/t = 12450 /0.605 ≈ 20580 ft·lbf/s ≈37.4 hp.

But none of the options have this. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, perhaps the power is not just the average power but the maximum power in the first second. Because part (b) asks for the mean rate of power absorption in the first second.

So in the first second, the car is decelerating from 15.133 ft/s to v = u + at = 15.133 -25*1 = negative 8.867 ft/s. Wait, that can't be right because the car stops in 0.605 seconds. So in the first second, the car would have already stopped. So the power is maximum at the beginning when velocity is highest.

So perhaps the initial power is F * u = 2717.4 lb *15.133 ft/s ≈ 41100 ft·lbf/s ≈74.7 hp. But looking at the options, option C has 337 hp for part (b), which is much higher. So perhaps I'm missing some factor.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the mechanical advantage or the area of the brake band. The problem gives the drum diameter, face width, and thickness. Maybe the area of the brake band is involved in calculating the force.

The brake band's area would be face width times thickness: 2 in * 1/4 in = 0.5 square inches. Convert to square feet: 0.5 /144 ≈0.003472 sq ft.

Assuming the coefficient of friction μ between the drum and the band, the braking force F = μ * (normal force). The normal force is the force clamping the band against the drum. But without knowing the clamping force or μ, I can't proceed directly. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to calculate the area and relate it to the force in another way.

Wait, another approach: the power absorbed by the brakes is the rate at which work is done. Work done is force times distance, so power P = F * v.

But I'm not sure how the dimensions of the drum and band come into play here. Maybe the area of contact affects the force. The area of the brake band is 2 in * 0.25 in = 0.5 in² = 0.003472 ft². The pressure on the drum would be F / area. But without knowing the pressure, I can't find F. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to find the rate at which heat is generated per unit area, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the heat generated per second is the power absorbed. So part (b) is the power in the first second, and part (c) is the average power.

Wait, the initial power is F * u = 2717.4 lb *15.133 ft/s ≈41100 ft·lbf/s ≈74.7 hp. But the options don't have this. So perhaps I'm missing a factor related to the number of wheels or something else. Wait, perhaps each wheel has a drum, and the total power is for all wheels. But the problem doesn't specify, so I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider the rotational speed of the drum. The car's speed is related to the drum's rotational speed. The circumference of the drum is π*diameter. Drum diameter is 10 inches, so circumference is 10 * π inches = 31.4159 inches. Convert to feet: 31.4159 /12 ≈2.61799 ft.

The car's speed is 55 mph, which is 15.133 ft/s. So the rotational speed ω = v / circumference =15.133 /2.61799 ≈5.782 rpm.

But how does this help with power? Power can also be expressed as torque times angular velocity. Torque is force times radius: F = m*a = 108.696 *25 ≈2717.4 lb. Torque τ = F * r =2717.4 lb *0.4167 ft ≈1131.9 lb·ft.

Then, power P = τ * ω (in rad/s). ω in rad/s is 5.782 * 2π/60 ≈0.603 rad/s. So P =1131.9 *0.603 ≈682.3 ft·lbf/s ≈1.24 hp. That's way too low. Hmm, I must be making a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing linear force with torque. The torque should be the force applied at the radius of the drum. The force F is the frictional force between the band and the drum. So F = μ * N, where N is the normal force. But without μ or N, I can't proceed. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the area of the brake band to calculate something else.

Wait, maybe the problem is about the heat generated by the brakes, which is the power multiplied by the time. So for part (a), the temperature rise would be the total heat (which is the KE) divided by the mass of the drum times specific heat.

But again, I don't have the drum's mass. The problem gives the drum's dimensions: diameter 10 in, face width 2 in, thickness 0.25 in. So the volume V = π*(r^2 - (r - t)^2)*width, where r is 5 in, t is 0.25 in, width is 2 in.

Calculating that:

r =5 in, r-t=4.75 in.

V = π*(5^2 -4.75^2)*2 = π*(25 -22.5625)*2 = π*(2.4375)*2 ≈4.875 * π ≈15.31 in³.

Convert inches to feet: 1 in = 0.0833 ft. So 15.31 in³ = (0.0833)^3 *15.31 ≈ (0.0005787) *15.31 ≈0.00886 ft³.

Density of steel is about 490 lb/ft³. So mass m = density * volume = 490 *0.00886 ≈4.34 lb.

So the drum's mass is about 4.34 lbs. Specific heat of steel is about 0.11 Btu/(lb·°F).

The total heat Q is the work done, which is 12450 ft·lbf. Convert ft·lbf to Btu: 12450 /778 ≈16.01 Btu.

So the temperature rise ΔT = Q/(m_drum * c) =16.01/(4.34 *0.11) ≈16.01/(0.4774) ≈33.5 °F.

But none of the options have a temperature increase around 33°F. The options start at 65°F and go up. So I must be making a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in calculating the drum's volume. Let me recalculate.

Drum is a cylinder with radius 5 in, width 2 in, and thickness 0.25 in. So it's like a hollow cylinder. The volume is π*(R² - r²)*length. R is outer radius 5 in, r is inner radius 5 -0.25=4.75 in. Length is 2 in.

So V = π*(5² -4.75²)*2 = π*(25 -22.5625)*2 = π*(2.4375)*2 ≈4.875 * π ≈15.31 in³. As before.

But converting to ft³, 15.31 in³ = 15.31/(12^3) =15.31/1728 ≈0.00886 ft³. That's correct.

Density is 490 lb/ft³, so mass is 490 *0.00886≈4.34 lb. Correct.

So specific heat is 0.11 Btu/(lb·°F). Q=16.01 Btu.

ΔT=16.01/(4.34 *0.11) ≈33.5°F. But none of the options match this. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the drum is not steel. Maybe it's something else with higher specific heat or lower mass. Alternatively, perhaps the heat is not entirely absorbed by the drum but also by other components. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to consider the heat per unit area.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different approach. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the power absorbed is the rate of work done, which is F * v. The initial power is F * u =2717.4 lb *15.133 ft/s ≈41100 ft·lbf/s ≈74.7 hp.

But looking at the options, the first option (A) has 350 hp for part (b), which is much higher. So perhaps I'm missing a factor related to the number of wheels or the efficiency. Maybe the car has four wheels, each with a drum brake, so total power would be four times that. But 74.7 *4 ≈299 hp, which isn't an option either.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the power based on the brake's surface area and the friction. The brake band's area is 2 in * 0.25 in = 0.5 in². The pressure on the brake could be related to the force. But without knowing the pressure, I can't proceed.

Wait, maybe the problem is considering the power per unit area. So the initial power per second is the work done per second, which is the initial kinetic energy divided by time. But that's the average power, not the initial.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different approach for part (a), the temperature rise. Maybe it's considering the heat generated per unit time and then the temperature rise based on that.

Wait, let's think about part (b), the mean rate of power absorption in the first second. The power at any time t is F(t) * v(t), where F(t) is the braking force, which is m*a = constant. v(t) = u - a*t. So power P(t) = m*a*(u -a*t).

At t=0, P(0)=m*a*u =108.696 *25 *15.133 ≈41100 ft·lbf/s ≈74.7 hp.

At t=1 second, the velocity is v=15.133 -25*1= -8.867 ft/s, but since the car stops at t=0.605 s, the power after that is zero. So the mean power in the first second would be the average of the power from t=0 to t=0.605 s, since after that, the car stops.

But integrating P(t) from 0 to 0.605:

P_avg = (1/(0.605)) * ∫(m a (u - a t)) dt from 0 to 0.605.

= (1/0.605) * [m a u t - (m a² t²)/2 ] from 0 to 0.605.

= (1/0.605) * [ m a u *0.605 - 0.5 m a² (0.605)^2 ]

= (1/0.605) * [ m a u *0.605 - 0.5 m a² *0.605² ]

= (1/0.605) * [ m a u *0.605 - 0.5 m a² *0.366 ]

= (1/0.605) * [ 0.605 m a u - 0.5 * m a² *0.366 ]

= (1/0.605) * [ 0.605 m a u - 0.183 m a² ]

= m a u - (0.183 m a² ) * (1/0.605)

= m a u - (0.183 /0.605) m a²

Plugging in m=108.696, a=25, u=15.133:

= 108.696*25*15.133 - (0.183/0.605)*108.696*25^2

Compute each term:

First term: 108.696 *25=2717.4, *15.133≈41100 ft·lbf/s.

Second term: (0.183/0.605)=0.3025, 25^2=625, 108.696 *625≈67935. So 0.3025 *67935≈20534.

So P_avg =41100 -20534 ≈20566 ft·lbf/s ≈37.4 hp. Again, same as before.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe I should consider that the average power over the first second is the total energy dissipated in that second divided by the time. The energy dissipated in the first second is the integral of P(t) from 0 to 1, but since the car stops at 0.605 s, it's only up to that time.

So energy in first 0.605 seconds is 12450 ft·lbf. So power is 12450 /0.605 ≈20580 ft·lbf/s ≈37.4 hp.

But again, the options don't have this. So perhaps the problem expects a different approach.

Wait, maybe the problem is considering the rotational power, which would involve the torque and angular velocity.

The torque τ = F * r =2717.4 lb *0.4167 ft≈1131.9 lb·ft.

Angular velocity ω = v / r =15.133 /0.4167 ≈36.28 rad/s.

Power P = τ * ω =1131.9 *36.28 ≈41074 ft·lbf/s ≈74.7 hp. Same as before.

But the options don't have this. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the options and see which one fits when considering the average power and the temperature rise.

Looking at the options, option C has an average power of 199 hp. Let's see how that might be achieved.

If the average power is 199 hp, then total energy would be 199 *550 * t, where t is the stopping time. If t is 0.605 s, then energy is 199 *550 *0.605 ≈199*332.75≈66, 000 ft·lbf, which is way higher than the KE of 12,450 ft·lbf. So that can't be right.

Alternatively, maybe the average power is 210 hp (option A). 210 *550 =115,500 ft·lbf/s. Over 0.605 s, that's 115500 *0.605 ≈69,900 ft·lbf, which is much higher than the KE. So that can't be.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the KE calculation. Let me recalculate the KE with the initial speed being 55 mph, not the average speed.

Wait, the problem says the average speed is 55 mph, so initial speed would be 55 *2 =110 mph, as I thought earlier. Let's recalculate KE with u=110 mph=154.667 ft/s.

KE=0.5 *108.696 * (154.667)^2 ≈0.5 *108.696 *23924 ≈0.5 *108.696 *23924 ≈0.5 *2,580,000 ≈1,290,000 ft·lbf.

Time to stop t =154.667 /25 ≈6.187 s.

Average power P_avg=1,290,000 /6.187 ≈208,600 ft·lbf/s ≈380 hp. But none of the options have this.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different approach for calculating the power, considering the area of the brake and the friction.

The friction force F = μ * N, where N is the normal force. The normal force is provided by the band's pressure against the drum. The area of the band is 2 in *0.25 in=0.5 in²=0.003472 ft².

Assume μ is 0.4 (a typical value for brakes), then F=μ*N. But without knowing N, I can't proceed. Alternatively, perhaps N is the force applied by the brake mechanism, which isn't given.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to calculate the power based on the area of the brake and the speed. The power could be expressed as P= F * v, where F is the braking force and v is the velocity.

But I'm stuck here. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the work done per unit time, which is power. The work done is the force times the distance, so power is force times velocity.

The force F is m*a =108.696 *25=2717.4 lb.

Velocity v=15.133 ft/s.

So initial power P=2717.4 *15.133 ≈41100 ft·lbf/s ≈74.7 hp.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the problem expects me to consider that each wheel has a drum, and the total power is four times this, so 74.7 *4 ≈299 hp. Still not matching the options.

Wait, looking at the options, option C has an average power of 199 hp. How could that be achieved? Maybe the braking force is different. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the braking force.

Wait, the braking force is F= m*a=108.696 *25=2717.4 lb. That's correct.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is using the rotational speed of the drum to calculate power. The drum's circumference is π*d=3.1416*10 inches=31.416 inches. At 55 mph, the car's speed is 15.133 ft/s, which is 181.584 inches/s. So the drum's rotational speed is 181.584 /31.416 ≈5.78 rpm.

Power can also be calculated as torque * angular velocity. Torque τ = F * r, where r is the radius in feet: 10 inches=0.8333 ft. So τ=2717.4 lb *0.8333 ft≈2264.5 lb·ft.

Angular velocity ω=5.78 rpm=5.78*(2π/60)=0.603 rad/s.

Power P=τ*ω=2264.5 *0.603≈1365.5 ft·lbf/s≈2.48 hp. That's way too low.

I'm clearly missing something here. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula for power in terms of the brake's surface area and the speed. The formula is P= (μ * W * v)/60, where W is the width of the brake and v is velocity in ft/min.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the power is calculated as the rate of heat dissipation, which is the work done per unit time.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the option where the average power is around 37 hp, but none have that. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the temperature rise as per the heat generated.

Earlier, I calculated ΔT=33.5°F, but the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the drum's mass.

Wait, perhaps the drum's mass is much larger. Let me recalculate the drum's volume and mass.

Drum volume V=π*(R² -r²)*width. R=5 in, r=4.75 in, width=2 in.

V=π*(25 -22.5625)*2=π*(2.4375)*2≈15.31 in³.

Convert to ft³: 15.31 in³=15.31/(12^3)=15.31/1728≈0.00886 ft³.

Density of steel is about 490 lb/ft³. So mass=0.00886 *490≈4.34 lb.

So the drum's mass is 4.34 lb. Specific heat c=0.11 Btu/(lb·°F).

Heat Q=16.01 Btu.

ΔT=Q/(m*c)=16.01/(4.34*0.11)=16.01/0.477≈33.5°F.

But none of the options have this. So perhaps the problem expects a different specific heat or drum mass.

Alternatively, perhaps the drum is made of a different material with higher specific heat or lower mass.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the heat is distributed over the entire surface area of the drum. The surface area of the drum is 2πR*W=2*3.1416*5*2=62.83 in²=4.34 ft².

If the heat generated is 16.01 Btu, and the area is 4.34 ft², then heat per unit area is 16.01/4.34≈3.69 Btu/ft².

But specific heat per area would require knowing the mass per area, which I don't have. So I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps the temperature rise is calculated using the formula Q= m*c*ΔT, but with Q in Btu, m in lb, c in Btu/(lb·°F), so ΔT=Q/(m*c).

But as before, that gives 33.5°F, which isn't an option.

I'm clearly missing something here. Maybe the problem expects me to consider that the drum's mass is part of the car's mass, but that doesn't make sense because the drum's mass is much smaller.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the total heat generated, which is the KE, and assuming it's all absorbed by the drum, but with a larger mass. Alternatively, perhaps the drum's mass is 3500 lbs, same as the car. But that would make ΔT=16.01/(3500*0.11)=16.01/(385)≈0.0416°F, which is way too low.

Alternatively, perhaps the drum's mass is 1000 lbs. Then ΔT=16.01/(1000*0.11)=16.01/110≈0.145°F, which is also too low.

Hmm, I'm really stuck here. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula for power as P= (F^2)/(μ*A), where F is the braking force, μ is the coefficient of friction, and A is the area of the brake. But without μ, I can't proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula for the rate of heat generation, which is P= F*v, and then using that to find the temperature rise.

But I'm not making progress. At this point, perhaps I should try to match the options based on the closest calculations.

From earlier, the average power is around 37 hp, but the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct option is C, which has an average power of 199 hp and a temperature rise of 99°F. But I'm not sure how that would fit.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial speed. If the average speed is 55 mph, then the initial speed is 55 mph, not 110. Let me recalculate with u=55 mph=15.133 ft/s.

Then, KE=0.5 *108.696 * (15.133)^2≈12450 ft·lbf.

Time to stop t=15.133/25≈0.605 s.

Average power P_avg=12450/0.605≈20580 ft·lbf/s≈37.4 hp.

But again, no option matches.

Wait, perhaps the initial speed is higher. Maybe the average speed during braking is 55 mph, so the initial speed is higher. Let me think: average speed is (u +0)/2 =u/2 =55 mph → u=110 mph=154.667 ft/s.

Then, KE=0.5 *108.696 * (154.667)^2≈1,290,000 ft·lbf.

Time to stop t=154.667/25≈6.187 s.

Average power P_avg=1,290,000 /6.187≈208,600 ft·lbf/s≈380 hp.

But no option has that. So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the rotational speed of the drum to calculate power, which I tried earlier, but that gave me 74.7 hp, which is close to option C's part (b) of 337 hp. No, that's not close.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to calculate the power based on the area of the brake and the speed, using some formula like P= (F * v) / (some factor).

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the power is the force times velocity, but the force is distributed over the area of the brake. So P= (F * v) / area, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula for power in terms of the brake's surface area, width, and speed, but I'm not familiar with that.

At this point, I think I'm stuck and might have to make an educated guess. Looking at the options, option C has a temperature increase of 99°F, which seems plausible if the drum's mass is smaller than I calculated. If the drum's mass were around 16.1 lb (since 16.01 Btu / (0.11 Btu/(lb·°F))=145.54 lb, but wait, that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps the drum's mass is 16.1 lb. Then ΔT=16.01/(16.1 *0.11)=16.01/1.771≈9.04°F. Not matching.

Alternatively, if the drum's mass is 161 lb, then ΔT=16.01/(161*0.11)=16.01/17.71≈0.9°F. No.

Alternatively, perhaps the specific heat is 0.033 Btu/(lb·°F), which is for aluminum. 16.01/(4.34 *0.033)=16.01/0.143≈111.9°F, which is close to option A's 110°F. So if the drum is aluminum, then ΔT≈112°F. Option A has 110°F. So perhaps the answer is A.

But the options don't specify the material, so I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the drum's mass is larger.

Wait, if the drum's mass is 160 lb, then ΔT=16.01/(160 *0.11)=16.01/17.6≈0.9°F, which is too low.

I'm really not sure. Based on the calculations I've done, the closest I get to the options is option C's 99°F, which would require a drum mass of about 161 lb (16.01/(99 *0.11)=16.01/(10.89)=1.47 lb, which doesn't make sense). Alternatively, perhaps the drum's mass is much larger, but that would lower the temperature rise.

Given the confusion, I'll have to make an educated guess. Based on the average power calculation, if the initial power is around 74.7 hp, and the options don't have that, perhaps the correct answer is option C, which has a temperature rise of 99°F and average power of 199 hp. But I'm not confident.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the power in the first second is the initial power, which is 74.7 hp, and the average power is half of that, around 37 hp. But none of the options match.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula for power as P = (F^2 * μ) / (some factor involving area and velocity), but I'm not sure.

In the end, I'm stuck and will have to choose the option that seems closest to my calculations. Based on the temperature rise, if I consider the drum's mass to be around 16 lb, then ΔT≈110°F, which matches option A. So I'll go with option A.

The problem involves calculating the temperature increase in the brake drum, the mean rate of power absorption in the first second, and the average power absorbed overall. The key steps involve determining the kinetic energy of the car, converting it to heat absorbed by the drum, and using the specific heat capacity of the drum material to find the temperature rise. The power calculations require understanding the braking force, velocity, and time to stop. Despite several attempts to reconcile the calculations with the given options, the closest match for the temperature increase and other parameters aligns with option A, assuming the drum's material and mass allow for a temperature rise of approximately 110°F.

**Answer: A**
