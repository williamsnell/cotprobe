Question:

After learning that a new housing development was about to be built, a developer began looking for property near the housing development on which he could build a shopping center. After an extensive search, he purchased a three-acre undeveloped tract of land for the purpose of developing a small shopping center. At the time the sale was finalized, the developer told his plans to the seller of the three-acre tract, and also mentioned that he was worried whether he had sufficient funds to complete the project. The seller agreed to lend money to the developer to allow for completion of the project. The seller then wrote out the following contract:"In order to help the developer with his plans for development of a shopping center on the three- acre tract he has this day purchased from me, I will lend him $50,000 at 10 percent interest provided he signs a contract with a builder for construction of the shopping center on this tract. Repayment to me at the rate of $5,000 per year to be secured by a mortgage on the three-acre tract. "Both parties then signed the contract. The seller's promise to lend $50,000 to the developer is

Options:

A: a condition precedent to the developer's duty to construct the shopping center.
B: a condition subsequent to the developer's duty to enter into a building construction contract.
C: not a condition, either precedent or subsequent, to the developer's duty to enter into a building construction contract.
D: a condition subsequent in form but precedent in substance to the seller's duty to lend the $50,000.
E: a condition precedent in form but subsequent in substance to the developer's duty to enter into a building construction contract.
F: a condition subsequent to the seller's duty to lend the $50,000.
G: a condition subsequent in form but precedent in substance to the developer's duty to enter into a building construction contract.
H: a condition precedent to the developer's duty to repay the loan.
I: not a condition, either precedent or subsequent, to the seller's duty to lend the $50,000.
J: a condition precedent in form but subsequent in substance to the developer's duty to repay the loan.

Okay, so I have this contracts question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's start by reading the question carefully.

The scenario is about a developer who bought land and then made a contract with the seller to borrow money. The developer was worried about funds, and the seller agreed to lend him $50k. The contract says the seller will lend the money provided the developer signs a contract with a builder. Then, the repayment terms are set with a mortgage on the three-acre tract.

The question is about whether the seller's promise to lend money is a condition precedent, subsequent, or neither, related to the developer's duty to enter into a building contract.

Alright, so first, I need to recall the difference between conditions precedent and conditions subsequent. A condition precedent is something that must happen before a party's duty to perform arises. It's like a prerequisite. If the condition isn't met, the duty doesn't arise. On the other hand, a condition subsequent is a right of termination or re-entrance after the duty has started. It allows a party to terminate the contract if a certain event occurs.

In this case, the seller agreed to lend $50k "provided he signs a contract with a builder." So, the lending is contingent on the developer signing a builder's contract. So, is the builder's contract a condition precedent to the seller's obligation to lend?

I think yes because the seller's promise to lend is dependent on the developer first entering into a builder's contract. Without that contract, the seller isn't obligated to lend the money. So, the builder's contract is a condition that must be met before the seller has to perform (lending the money). That makes it a condition precedent to the seller's duty.

Wait, but the question is about the seller's promise to lend as a condition related to the developer's duty. The developer's duty here would be to repay the loan, I think, but the question is phrased as the seller's promise being a condition to the developer's duty to enter into a building contract. Hmm, maybe I got that mixed up.

Wait, let me clarify. The contract says the seller will lend the money provided the developer enters into a building contract. So, the condition is on the developer's action (signing the builder contract) before the seller's duty to lend. So, for the seller to have to lend, the developer must first sign the builder's contract. That makes the builder's contract a condition precedent to the seller's duty to lend.

But the question is phrased as, "the seller's promise to lend... is..." and the options are about whether it's a condition to the developer's duty. Wait, maybe I need to think of it from the developer's perspective. The developer's duty could be to repay the loan, but the initial condition is about the builder's contract.

Let me think again. The contract says the seller will lend $50k "provided he signs a contract with a builder." So, the developer must sign the builder's contract before the seller will lend the money. So, the signing of the builder's contract is a condition that must occur before the seller's obligation arises.

So, for the seller's duty to lend (to give the $50k), the developer must first sign the builder's contract. That makes the builder's contract a condition precedent to the seller's duty to lend.

Now, looking at the options, which one matches this?

Option A: a condition precedent to the developer's duty to construct the shopping center. Hmm, that's about the developer's duty. But the condition is about the developer signing the builder's contract, which is separate from the duty to construct. Maybe not.

Option B: a condition subsequent to the developer's duty to enter into a building contract. That doesn't fit because the condition is a prerequisite, not something that happens after.

Option C: not a condition... Hmm, no, because the contract is conditional.

Option D: a condition subsequent in form but precedent in substance to the seller's duty. Wait, the contract says "provided he signs," so it's a condition in form, but in substance, it's a condition precedent because it must happen before the seller's duty.

Option E: condition precedent in form but subsequent in substance to the developer's duty. Not sure.

Option F: condition subsequent to the seller's duty to lend. No, because it's a prerequisite.

Option G: condition subsequent in form but precedent in substance to the developer's duty. Maybe not.

Option H: condition precedent to the developer's duty to repay. Repayment is a duty separate from entering the builder's contract. The condition is about the builder's contract, not repayment.

Option I: not a condition... No.

Option J: condition precedent in form but subsequent in substance to the developer's duty to repay. Doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this differently. The seller's promise to lend is contingent on the developer entering into a builder's contract. So, for the seller to be obligated to lend, the developer must first sign a builder's contract. Therefore, the condition is a condition precedent to the seller's duty to lend.

Looking at the options, which one says that the seller's promise is a condition precedent to the seller's own duty? Let me check the options again.

Option D says: a condition subsequent in form but precedent in substance to the seller's duty to lend. No, because it's a condition precedent, not subsequent.

Option I says it's not a condition to the seller's duty, which is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the question is about whether the condition is on the developer's duty. So, the developer's duty to do something (like repay) is conditioned on something else.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The key is that the seller's promise to lend is subject to the condition that the developer enters into a builder's contract. So, the condition is a condition precedent to the seller's duty to lend. Therefore, the seller's promise is a condition that must be met before the seller has to perform (lending).

So, looking at the options, which one says that the seller's promise is a condition precedent to the seller's own duty? Because the seller can't lend until the condition is met.

Option D says it's a condition subsequent in form but precedent in substance to the seller's duty. Hmm, the form is "provided he signs," which is a condition in the contract. Subsequent in form might mean that it's phrased as a condition after the main promise, but in substance, it's a condition that must be met before the seller's duty.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is that the condition is a condition precedent to the seller's duty. So, looking for that.

Wait, the options don't have that exactly. Let me see:

Option D: a condition subsequent in form but precedent in substance to the seller's duty to lend.

So, the wording in the contract is "provided he signs," which is a condition that must be satisfied before the seller's duty arises. So, in form, it's a condition, but in substance, it's a condition precedent because it's a prerequisite.

Alternatively, perhaps "provided he signs" is a condition subsequent because it's a requirement that must be met, but that's not correct because condition subsequent usually refers to the right to terminate after performance has begun.

Wait, no. The key is that the condition must be met before the duty to perform arises. So, the condition is a condition precedent.

Looking at the options, perhaps option D is correct because it's phrased as a condition in the contract, but in substance, it's a condition precedent for the seller's duty.

Alternatively, option I says it's not a condition, which is wrong because it clearly is.

Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is that it's not a condition to the developer's duty, but to the seller's duty.

Wait, the question is: "The seller's promise to lend $50,000 to the developer is..." and the options are about whether it's a condition to the developer's duty.

Wait, perhaps I've been misunderstanding the question. The options are phrased as whether the seller's promise is a condition to the developer's duty.

Wait, no. Let me read the options again.

Option A: condition precedent to the developer's duty to construct.

Option B: condition subsequent to the developer's duty to enter into a building contract.

Option C: not a condition to the developer's duty.

Option D: condition subsequent in form but precedent in substance to the seller's duty.

Option E: condition precedent in form but subsequent in substance to the developer's duty.

Option F: condition subsequent to the seller's duty.

Option G: condition subsequent in form but precedent in substance to the developer's duty.

Option H: condition precedent to the developer's duty to repay.

Option I: not a condition to the seller's duty.

Option J: condition precedent in form but subsequent in substance to the developer's duty to repay.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. The question is asking about the seller's promise as a condition to the developer's duty. Or is it about the condition to the seller's own duty?

Wait, the question is: "The seller's promise to lend $50,000 to the developer is..." So, the seller's promise is being analyzed as a condition to something. The options are about whether that promise is a condition to the developer's duty.

Wait, perhaps the correct way is that the condition is on the developer's side. The seller is making a loan contingent on the developer entering into a builder's contract. So, the developer's duty to do what? To repay? Or to enter into the builder's contract.

Wait, the contract says the seller will lend provided the developer signs a contract with a builder. So, the condition is on the developer's action (signing the builder's contract) before the seller's duty to lend arises.

Therefore, the condition is a condition precedent to the seller's duty to lend. But the question is about the seller's promise being a condition to the developer's duty. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The seller's promise is conditioned on the developer entering into a builder's contract. So, the condition is a condition to the seller's duty to lend. Therefore, the condition is a condition precedent to the seller's duty.

Looking at the options, option D says it's a condition subsequent in form but precedent in substance to the seller's duty. That makes sense because the contract uses the word "provided," which is a condition, but in substance, it's a condition precedent because it must occur before the seller's duty to lend.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is that it's a condition subsequent to the developer's duty to enter into a building contract. But that doesn't make sense because the condition is a prerequisite for the seller's lending, not dependent on the developer's performance after the loan is given.

Wait, another approach: the condition is that the developer must sign a builder's contract before the seller will lend. So, the condition is a condition precedent for the seller's duty to lend. Therefore, the seller's promise is subject to this condition.

So, looking at the options, which one aligns with that.

Option D: condition subsequent in form but precedent in substance to the seller's duty to lend. This seems to fit because the contract wording is a condition (form), but it's a condition precedent (substance) for the seller's duty.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to see that the condition is a condition precedent to the seller's duty to lend, which would make option D correct because it's a condition in form (as written) that is actually a condition precedent in substance.

So, after considering all this, I think the correct answer is D.
</think>

The seller's promise to lend $50,000 is contingent on the developer signing a contract with a builder. This means the condition is a prerequisite for the seller's duty to lend, making it a condition precedent in substance. However, the contract is phrased using "provided," which is a condition in form. Therefore, the seller's promise is a condition subsequent in form but precedent in substance to the seller's duty to lend.
