Okay, so I have this question about Singer's views on the social problems resulting from a genetic supermarket. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that Peter Singer is a philosopher who writes about ethics, including topics like genetic engineering. The term "genetic supermarket" probably refers to a scenario where people can choose various genetic enhancements for their children, kind of like picking items from a store.

The question is asking which social problem Singer thinks is the least serious among the options provided. Let's look at the options:

A: loss of human diversity
B: effects of engineering children to have positional goods
C: loss of equality of opportunity
D: increased disparity between the rich and the poor

I think I need to recall what Singer has said about each of these. Loss of diversity could happen if everyone ends up having similar traits because they choose the same enhancements. That's a concern because diversity is valuable for various reasons, including cultural richness and adaptability.

Option B talks about positional goods. Positional goods are things that derive their value from being rare or exclusive, like certain luxury items. If parents engineer their kids to have these, it could lead to competition and inequality, as only the wealthy can afford such enhancements.

Option C is about equality of opportunity. If genetic enhancements are available only to the rich, then poorer children won't have the same starting chances in life, which would reduce equality of opportunity. That's a significant issue because it affects social mobility and fairness.

Option D is increased disparity between rich and poor. This seems related to C, but perhaps more about the overall wealth gap. If genetic enhancements make the rich even richer by giving their kids advantages, the disparity could grow, leading to a bigger divide between classes.

Now, from what I remember, Singer has discussed these issues. He's concerned about the potential for inequality and the commodification of children. But I think he might consider the loss of human diversity as a problem, though perhaps not the most pressing. Alternatively, maybe the effects of positional goods are more directly harmful because they can lead to intense competition and social stratification.

Wait, but I'm trying to remember if Singer thinks that some of these are more or less serious. For example, in "Designer Baby" scenarios, Singer might argue that while inequality is a problem, the loss of diversity could be a more fundamental issue. However, I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, maybe he considers the loss of equality of opportunity (C) as a serious issue because it directly impacts fairness in society. If people can't compete on equal footing, it undermines the principles of a just society.

But the question is about which is the least serious. So, perhaps Singer thinks that the loss of human diversity (A) is a problem, but maybe not as severe as the others because diversity can adapt over time, and human society can find ways to value differences. Or maybe he thinks that while diversity is lost, the other issues like inequality have more immediate and severe consequences.

Wait, another angle: Singer might prioritize issues that directly affect individuals' well-being. The loss of diversity might be more about identity and less about immediate harm. Engineering for positional goods could lead to a kind of arms race, where everyone feels compelled to enhance their kids to keep up, leading to stress and social instability. That could be quite serious.

On the other hand, increased disparity (D) is a major issue because it exacerbates existing inequalities and can lead to social unrest. Loss of equality of opportunity (C) directly affects people's ability to succeed, which is crucial for a fair society.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about which of these Singer downplays. I think Singer has written that the loss of diversity is a concern, but perhaps he doesn't see it as the most serious problem compared to issues like inequality and opportunity.

Wait, in his article "Genetic enhancements and the Olympic spirit," or something similar, Singer might argue that the real problems are the inequalities that genetic engineering could introduce. So, perhaps he considers the loss of diversity (A) as less serious than the other options.

So, putting it all together, the least serious problem according to Singer would be A: loss of human diversity.

Singer discusses the potential social problems arising from a genetic supermarket, where individuals can select genetic enhancements for their children. Among the options provided, the loss of human diversity (A) is considered the least serious by Singer. While he acknowledges that diversity is valuable, he emphasizes that the more pressing issues relate to inequality and fairness. Engineering children for positional goods (B), the loss of equality of opportunity (C), and increased disparity between the rich and poor (D) are seen as more serious because they directly impact social justice and individual well-being. Singer's focus on these issues suggests that while diversity is important, the other problems pose greater ethical concerns.

The answer is A.
