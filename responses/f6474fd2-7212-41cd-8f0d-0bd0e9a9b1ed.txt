Question:

Arthropods have an exoskeleton. How is movement accomplished?

Options:

A: They use their wings to move
B: They move by changing the shape of their exoskeleton
C: They use cilia on the surface of their exoskeleton to move
D: They move due to their muscular system
E: They have a soft, pliable inner layer that bends to facilitate movement
F: Movement is achieved through hydraulic pressure changes within each segment
G: They release a special fluid that lubricates the joints of the exoskeleton for movement
H: The exoskeleton contracts and expands allowing for movement
I: Movement is achieved by the exoskeleton splitting and reforming in new positions
J: The body is segmented and the segments are joined by a thin layer of flexible chitin

Okay, so I've got this question about arthropods and how they move. Let me think through this. Arthropods are a big group of animals, including insects, spiders, crabs, and more. The question is about their exoskeleton and movement.

First, I remember that arthropods have an exoskeleton, which is an external skeleton made of chitin and proteins. This exoskeleton provides support and protection. But how do they move with that? Well, I know that many arthropods have jointed limbs. For example, insects have legs that bend at joints, kind of like how our elbows and knees work.

Wait, but the options given don't directly mention jointed limbs. Let's look at the options again. Option A says they use wings, but not all arthropods have wings. So A isn't correct in general. Option B talks about changing the shape of the exoskeleton. Hmm, I'm not sure about that. Do they reshape their exoskeleton to move? I don't think that's how movement works.

Option C suggests cilia on the exoskeleton. Cilia are tiny hairs, but I don't think arthropods move by using cilia. Maybe some small organisms do, but not arthropods. Option D mentions the muscular system. Right, muscles are involved in movement, but how exactly does the exoskeleton facilitate that?

Option E says a soft inner layer bends. I think the exoskeleton is hard, so maybe there's a soft inner layer that allows movement by bending. That makes some sense because the exoskeleton can't bend on its own, so the muscles have to pull on it to move the segments.

Option F talks about hydraulic pressure. I'm not too sure about this. Hydraulic movement is more common in things like earthworms or some invertebrates, but arthropods rely more on muscles and their segmented bodies. Option G is about lubricating fluid. I don't recall arthropods releasing fluid for movement; they might have joints that are oiled, but I'm not certain.

Option H suggests contraction and expansion of the exoskeleton. That doesn't sound right because the exoskeleton is rigid, so it can't really expand or contract. Option I says the exoskeleton splits and reforms. That's more like molting, which happens when they shed their exoskeleton, but that's not how they move daily.

Option J mentions segmented bodies with flexible chitin. Yes, arthropods are segmented, and the segments are connected by flexible parts, which allows movement. So each segment can move relative to the others because the connections are flexible.

Wait, so putting it together. The exoskeleton is hard, but between the segments, there's a flexible joint made of chitin. The muscles attach to these segments, and when they contract, the segments move. So the movement is facilitated by the segmented structure and the muscles pulling on the exoskeleton.

Looking back at the options, option J says the body is segmented and the segments are joined by a thin layer of flexible chitin. That seems to fit. So J is the correct answer.

The correct answer is J: The body is segmented and the segments are joined by a thin layer of flexible chitin. This structure allows arthropods to move by contracting their muscles, which pull on the exoskeleton's segments. 

Answer: J
