Question:

A sexually active 20-year-old woman has had fever, chills, malaise, and pain of the vulva for 2 days. Examination shows a vulvar pustule that has ulcerated and formed multiple satellite lesions. Nodes are palpated in the inguinal and femoral areas. A smear of fluid from the lesions establishes the diagnosis. Which of the following is the most likely causal organism?

Options:

A: Mycoplasma genitalium
B: Herpes simplex virus
C: Candida albicans
D: Chlamydia trachomatis
E: Streptococcus pyogenes (group A)
F: Human papillomavirus
G: Haemophilus ducreyi
H: Neisseria gonorrhoeae
I: Trichomonas vaginalis
J: Treponema pallidum

Okay, so I have this question about a sexually active 20-year-old woman with symptoms like fever, chills, malaise, and vulvar pain for two days. On exam, there's a pustule that's ulcerated with satellite lesions, and she has inguinal and femoral lymph nodes. They took a smear from the lesions to diagnose.

Hmm, let me think about possible STIs that cause such symptoms. The patient is sexually active, so STIs are likely. The symptoms include a genital lesion, which is a common presentation for several infections.

The pustule ulcerating and having satellite lesions makes me think of something that spreads or causes multiple sores. Also, the presence of inguinal and femoral nodes suggests lymphadenopathy, which can be a sign of an STI.

Let me go through the options:

A: Mycoplasma genitalium – I think this usually causes urethritis and is asymptomatic or causes mild symptoms. Maybe not typically associated with pustules and ulcers.

B: Herpes simplex virus – HSV causes blisters and ulcers. It can cause multiple lesions and lymphadenopathy. The fever and malaise fit too. But does it form pustules? HSV typically forms vesicles that can become ulcers.

C: Candida albicans – This is a yeast infection, leading to things like thrush or yeast infections. It usually presents with white discharge, not pustules and ulcers. So probably not.

D: Chlamydia trachomatis – Chlamydia can cause urethritis and sometimes pelvic inflammatory disease, but I'm not sure about pustules and satellite lesions. It can cause some lesions, but maybe not as much as other options.

E: Streptococcus pyogenes (group A) – This is like the bacteria causing strep throat. Could it cause genital infections? Maybe, but I'm not as familiar with it causing pustular lesions in the vulval area.

F: Human papillomavirus – HPV causes warts, usually asymptomatic. Not the kind of lesions described here.

G: Haemophilus ducreyi – Oh, wait, isn't this the cause of ducreyi infection, which is a sexually transmitted disease? I think it can cause painful ulcers, and sometimes multiple lesions. It's known for causing what's called "soft chancre," which is a painless or tender ulcer, but in some cases, it can be painful. Also, it can cause lymphadenopathy, especially in the inguinal area. That sounds like a fit.

H: Neisseria gonorrhoeae – Gonorrhea can cause cervicitis, urethritis, and sometimes disseminated infection. It can also cause pustular discharge but I'm not sure about the satellite lesions and the systemic symptoms as presented.

I: Trichomonas vaginalis – This causes a protozoal infection leading to frothy discharge, itching, and maybe some redness, but not pustules or ulcers.

J: Treponema pallidum – This is syphilis. Primary syphilis causes a chancre, which is a painless ulcer. It can later cause more lesions, but the systemic symptoms like fever and malaise are possible. However, syphilis usually presents with a single chancre, not multiple satellite lesions unless it's secondary syphilis, which is later stages.

Wait, but the question says "vulvar pustule that has ulcerated and formed multiple satellite lesions." So initial pustule, then ulceration with more lesions around it. Haemophilus ducreyi (G) is known to cause such lesions, often called "papulopustular" or "瘭疽." It can cause multiple small ulcers and is associated with lymphadenopathy. Also, the fact that it's a sexually transmitted disease fits with her being sexually active.

So considering all this, the most likely answer is G: Haemophilus ducreyi.
</think>

The most likely causal organism is **G: Haemophilus ducreyi**. This bacterium is known to cause a sexually transmitted infection that presents with painful or tender ulcers, often referred to as "soft chancres." The lesions can evolve into pustules and satellite lesions, and it is commonly associated with inguinal lymphadenopathy. The systemic symptoms, such as fever and malaise, further support this diagnosis. Other options like Herpes simplex virus (B) and Treponema pallidum (J) can cause similar lesions, but Haemophilus ducreyi is more consistent with the described symptoms and presentation.

Answer: G
