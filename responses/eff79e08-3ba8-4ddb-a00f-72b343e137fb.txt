Question:

A 65-year-old man who is quadriplegic as a result of multiple sclerosis is hospitalized for treatment of left lower lobe pneumonia. His temperature is 38.1°C (100.5°F), pulse is 95/min, respirations are 12/min, and blood pressure is 120/80 mm Hg. He appears malnourished. Rhonchi are heard at the left lower lobe of the lung on auscultation. Examination of the heart, lymph nodes, abdomen, and extremities shows no abnormalities. There is a 1-cm area of erythema over the sacrum with intact skin and no induration. Neurologic examination shows quadriparesis. Test of the stool for occult blood is negative. Which of the following is the most effective intervention for this patient's skin lesion?

Options:

A: Frequent turning
B: Use of wet to dry dressings
C: Whirlpool therapy
D: Broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy

Okay, so I have this question about a patient with a skin lesion, and I need to figure out the best intervention. Let me read through the scenario again carefully.

The patient is a 65-year-old man who's quadriplegic due to multiple sclerosis. He's in the hospital for pneumonia in the left lower lobe. His vital signs are slightly elevated temperature, pulse 95, respiration 12, blood pressure 120/80. He looks malnourished. On auscultation, there are rhonchi at the left lower lobe. Other exams like heart, lymph nodes, abdomen, and extremities are normal. There's a 1 cm area of erythema over the sacrum with intact skin and no induration. Neurological exam shows quadriparesis. Stool test for blood is negative.

The question is about the most effective intervention for his skin lesion. The options are A through D.

First, I need to understand what the skin lesion is. The description says erythema over the sacrum, 1 cm area, intact skin, no induration. So it's redness without the skin breaking down. That sounds like a stage 1 pressure ulcer, also known as a bedsore or decubitus ulcer. Stage 1 is characterized by red skin that doesn't blanch when pressed, but in this case, it's just erythema with intact skin, so maybe it's an early sign.

Now, the patient is quadriplegic, which means he has limited mobility, especially in the lower body. Quadriplegia often leads to pressure points where the skin is under constant pressure, like the sacrum, heels, etc. Pressure ulcers are a common issue in such patients.

The options given are:

A: Frequent turning
B: Wet to dry dressings
C: Whirlpool therapy
D: Broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy

Let's think about each option.

A: Frequent turning. For pressure ulcers, repositioning and offloading the affected area is crucial. Turning a patient every 2 hours can prevent further pressure and progression of the ulcer. This seems like a standard and effective intervention.

B: Wet to dry dressings. These are typically used to clean and dress wounds. However, in a stage 1 ulcer where the skin is still intact, wet to dry dressings might not be necessary. Usually, once the skin breaks down (stage 2 or worse), dressings are more important. But if the skin is still intact, maybe other measures are better.

C: Whirlpool therapy. This is more for patients with burns, infections, or when the skin needs hydrotherapy. It's not the first line for preventing or treating early pressure ulcers. Plus, the patient might not be mobile enough to use whirlpool therapy without assistance, and it's probably not needed for erythema without breakdown.

D: Broad-spectrum antibiotics. These are used when there's an infection, like cellulitis or a deep wound. But in this case, the skin is intact with just erythema. The stool test for blood is negative, so maybe no gastrointestinal bleeding. No signs of systemic infection like high fever or leukocytosis. So antibiotics might not be indicated here.

So the most effective intervention would be to prevent further pressure by turning him frequently. That would reduce the pressure on the sacrum and prevent the erythema from progressing to a more serious stage.

I think the answer is A: Frequent turning.

The patient is a 65-year-old quadriplegic with multiple sclerosis, hospitalized for pneumonia. He has erythema over the sacrum, which is likely a stage 1 pressure ulcer. The most effective intervention is to prevent further pressure by frequently turning the patient. 

Answer: A
