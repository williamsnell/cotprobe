Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the patient is a 22-year-old male who has been having diarrhea for 5 days after finishing his third course of antibiotics for mastoiditis. Physical exam shows vague abdominal pain when touched. The culture on Hektoen Enteric Agar is positive. We need to figure out the likely cause of the diarrhea.

First, I remember that antibiotics can disrupt the normal gut flora, leading to infections like C. difficile. The patient is on his third course, which suggests he's been on a lot of antibiotics, making him more susceptible. C. difficile often causes pseudomembranous colitis, which can lead to diarrhea, and it's known to grow well on Hektoen agar, especially with a positive culture.

Looking at the other options: Entamoeba histolytica usually causes amoebic dysentery, which is more associated with traveler's diarrhea or exposure to certain regions. Vibrio cholerae is from contaminated water and causes severe watery diarrhea. E. coli has various strains; some cause traveler's diarrhea, but without specific info like HUS or severe bloody diarrhea, it's less likely. Staph aureus can cause food poisoning but usually presents with vomiting and rapid-onset diarrhea. Campylobacter is common but often from undercooked meat, and the antibiotics might influence that, but C. diff is more likely post-antibiotics. Giardia is a parasite, usually from water or food, but the antibiotic use might predispose, but the positive Hektoen might not fit as well. Salmonella is another bacteria, but again, more about food poisoning. Yersinia could be possible, but it's less common. Shigella causes dysentery with blood and mucus, which isn't mentioned here.

So, considering the antibiotics, the positive Hektoen, and the symptoms, C. difficile seems the most likely.
