Okay, so I have this calculus problem here where I need to find the volume of a solid generated by rotating the region bounded by the x-axis and the function f(x) = x/(1 + x³) about the x-axis. The options are from A to J, and I need to choose the correct one. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that when you rotate a function around the x-axis, the volume can be found using the method of disks or washers. The formula for the volume using the disk method is V = π ∫[a to b] (f(x))² dx. So I'll need to set up this integral.

But wait, I should first figure out the limits of integration, right? The region is bounded by the x-axis and the function f(x). So I need to find where f(x) intersects the x-axis because those will be my a and b. 

Setting f(x) equal to zero: x/(1 + x³) = 0. The numerator is x, so this equals zero when x=0. But does it cross the x-axis anywhere else? Let me think. The denominator is 1 + x³, which is never zero for real x because x³ is only zero when x=0, but then the denominator would be 1, so f(0)=0. Wait, does the function cross the x-axis again? Let me check for other x values where x/(1+x³) =0. Well, since the denominator is always positive except at x=-1, but x=-1 would make the denominator zero, which is undefined. So the only real root is x=0.

Wait, but if I'm integrating from negative infinity to positive infinity, but that doesn't make sense because the function might not be bounded. Alternatively, perhaps the region is bounded between x=0 and where f(x) is positive or negative. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me graph the function mentally. For x >0, x is positive, and 1 +x³ is positive, so f(x) is positive. For x <0, x is negative, and 1 +x³ is 1 + (negative). Let's see, when x approaches -1, x³ is -1, so denominator becomes 0, so f(x) approaches negative infinity near x=-1. For x < -1, x³ is more negative than 1, so denominator is negative. So x/(negative) is positive when x is negative (since x is negative and denominator is negative, their ratio is positive). Wait, no: Let me check, if x is negative, say x = -2, then denominator is 1 + (-8) = -7, so f(-2) = (-2)/(-7) = 2/7, which is positive. So between x= -infinity and x= -1, f(x) is positive. Between x=-1 and x=0, denominator 1 +x³ approaches 0 as x approaches -1 from the right. For x just above -1, like x=-0.5, denominator is 1 + (-0.125) = 0.875, positive, so f(x) is negative because numerator is negative. So between x=-1 and x=0, f(x) is negative.

But wait, the problem says the region is bounded by the x-axis and the function f(x). So I think the region we're considering is where f(x) is above or below the x-axis, but since it's being rotated around the x-axis, the volume would include all regions where f(x) is non-zero. Wait, but I'm a bit confused about the exact limits here. Maybe I should find where the function crosses the x-axis, which is only at x=0. So perhaps the region extends from x=0 to where? Or maybe from x approaching negative infinity to x approaching positive infinity, but that seems like an improper integral. Alternatively, perhaps the function is positive from x=0 to some point, and negative elsewhere, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I should first analyze the behavior of f(x). As x approaches infinity, f(x) = x/(x³) = 1/x², which approaches zero. As x approaches negative infinity, f(x) = x/(x³) = 1/x², which also approaches zero. So the function tends to zero at both ends. It has vertical asymptotes where denominator is zero, which is at x = -1 (since 1 +x³=0 → x= -1). So near x=-1, the function goes to positive infinity on the left (as x approaches -1 from the left) and negative infinity on the right (as x approaches -1 from the right). 

Wait, but the problem says the region bounded by the x-axis and the function. So perhaps the region is from x=-1 to x=0, where the function is below the x-axis (since for x between -1 and 0, f(x) is negative, as I thought earlier). Or maybe from x=0 onwards, but that's only positive. Hmm, maybe the problem is considering the entire area where f(x) is above or below the x-axis, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the function is only being considered for x ≥ 0, but that's not specified.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to sketch the graph. For x >0, f(x) is positive and decreasing towards zero. For x < -1, f(x) is positive and goes to zero as x approaches negative infinity. Between x=-1 and x=0, f(x) is negative, going from negative infinity at x=-1+ to zero at x=0. So the function is in two parts: positive for x < -1 and x >0, negative between x=-1 and x=0.

But the problem says the region bounded by the x-axis and f(x). So perhaps the bounded region is between x=-1 and x=0, where f(x) is below the x-axis, and between x=0 and some point where f(x) is above. Wait, but without specific limits, maybe the integral is from x=0 to where f(x) is positive. Alternatively, perhaps the function is being considered between x=0 and x approaching infinity, but that would be an improper integral.

Wait, maybe I should consider the entire area where the function doesn't cross the x-axis except at x=0. So perhaps the region is from x=0 to infinity, because for x>0, f(x) is positive, and the area under the curve from x=0 to infinity would be bounded by the x-axis (y=0) and f(x). Alternatively, perhaps the region includes x from -1 to 0, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should proceed step by step.

First, find the points where f(x) intersects the x-axis. As I found, f(x)=0 only at x=0.

Now, the function is positive for x < -1 and x >0, and negative between x=-1 and x=0. So the regions bounded by the x-axis and the function would consist of two parts: one between x approaching -infinity and x=-1 (positive region), another between x=-1 and x=0 (negative region), and another between x=0 and x=+infinity (positive region). But perhaps the problem is only considering the part where the function is above the x-axis, i.e., x >=0, because that's a common scenario. Alternatively, maybe the region is from x=0 to where f(x) is positive, but perhaps the integral is from x=0 to infinity, but that would give an infinite volume, which isn't one of the options. So maybe the region is from x=0 to some finite point where f(x) is positive. Alternatively, perhaps the function is only considered for x >=0, and the region is from x=0 to where f(x) is positive, but I'm not sure. Maybe I should proceed with the integral from 0 to infinity.

Wait, but before that, let me check if the integral from 0 to infinity converges. Because if it does, then the volume would be finite.

So, let's set up the volume integral for x from 0 to infinity:

V = π ∫[0, ∞) (x/(1 + x³))² dx.

But before integrating, maybe I should simplify the integrand.

Expanding (x/(1 + x³))², we get x²/(1 + x³)^2.

So, V = π ∫[0, ∞) x²/(1 + x³)^2 dx.

Hmm, perhaps substitution would help here. Let me let u = 1 + x³. Then du/dx = 3x² → du = 3x² dx → x² dx = du/3.

So, substituting, when x=0, u=1 + 0=1, and as x approaches infinity, u approaches infinity.

So the integral becomes:

V = π ∫[u=1 to ∞] (x² dx)/(u)^2 = π ∫[1 to ∞] (du/3) / u² = (π/3) ∫[1 to ∞] u^(-2) du.

The integral of u^(-2) is -u^(-1), so:

V = (π/3) [ -1/u ] from 1 to ∞.

Evaluating the limits:

At u=∞, -1/∞ = 0.

At u=1, -1/1 = -1.

So, V = (π/3) [0 - (-1)] = (π/3)(1) = π/3.

Wait, but π/3 is option E. Hmm, but let's make sure I didn't make a mistake. Did I consider the entire region correctly? Because I only integrated from x=0 to infinity, but perhaps the problem includes the region from x=-1 to 0 as well.

Wait, if I include the region from x=-1 to 0, which is where the function is negative, then the volume would be the same as for x=0 to 1, because when you square f(x), the negative part becomes positive. So perhaps I should also integrate from x=-1 to 0.

Wait, but let me think about that. The function from x=-1 to 0 is negative, but when we square it, it becomes positive. So the integral from x=-1 to 0 would add to the volume. So perhaps I should compute the integral from x=-1 to 0 as well.

But wait, let me check the behavior at x=-1. The function has a vertical asymptote there, so the integral from x approaching -1 from the right (x = -1+) to x=0 would be another part. So perhaps the total volume is the sum of the integrals from x=-1 to 0 and from x=0 to infinity.

Wait, but first, let me compute the integral from x=-1 to 0.

So, V_total = π [ ∫[-1, 0] (x/(1 + x³))^2 dx + ∫[0, ∞) (x/(1 + x³))^2 dx ]

But when x is negative, let's see if substitution works the same way.

Let u = 1 + x³. Then du = 3x² dx. But x is negative in this interval, so x² is positive, and du is positive as well because x² is positive. So the substitution should work similarly.

So, ∫[x=-1 to 0] x²/(1 + x³)^2 dx.

Again, u = 1 + x³.

At x=-1, u = 1 + (-1)^3 = 1 -1 = 0.

At x=0, u=1 +0=1.

So, the integral becomes ∫[u=0 to 1] (x² dx)/(u^2) = ∫[0 to1] (du/3)/u^2 = (1/3) ∫[0 to1] u^(-2) du.

But wait, the integral of u^(-2) is -u^(-1), so:

(1/3)[ -1/u ] from 0 to 1.

But as u approaches 0 from the positive side, 1/u approaches infinity. So this integral would diverge to infinity. That can't be right because the problem must have a finite volume. So perhaps I made a mistake in considering the region from x=-1 to 0.

Wait, perhaps the function isn't defined at x=-1, and the region is only from x=0 onwards because including x=-1 would cause the integral to diverge. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the region where the function is positive, which is x >=0. Alternatively, perhaps the function is being considered from x=0 to where it meets some other condition, but the problem statement isn't clear.

Wait, let me read the problem again: "The region bounded by the x-axis and the function f(x) = x/(1 + x³) is rotated about the x-axis." So perhaps the region is where the function is above the x-axis, which would be for x >=0 and x < -1. But since x < -1 would require integrating from negative infinity to -1, which might also lead to an infinite volume. Alternatively, perhaps the region is between two points where the function crosses the x-axis, but since it only crosses at x=0, that's the only point. So perhaps the region is from x=0 to where the function is positive, but for x>0, the function approaches zero as x approaches infinity.

Wait, but earlier when I integrated from x=0 to infinity, I got V=π/3, which is option E. But let me check if that's correct.

Wait, let me do the substitution again.

Let me write the integral from x=0 to infinity:

V = π ∫[0, ∞) (x/(1 + x³))² dx = π ∫[0, ∞) x²/(1 +x³)^2 dx.

Let u = 1 + x³ → du = 3x² dx → x² dx = du/3.

When x=0, u=1. When x→infty, u→infty.

So, V = π ∫[u=1 to ∞] (x² dx)/(u^2) = π ∫[1 to ∞] (du/3) / u^2 = (π/3) ∫[1 to ∞] u^(-2) du.

The integral of u^(-2) is -1/u. So,

V = (π/3) [ (-1/u) from 1 to ∞ ] = (π/3)[ (0) - (-1/1) ] = (π/3)(1) = π/3.

So that's correct. So the volume from x=0 to infinity is π/3. But what about from x=-infty to x=-1? Let me check that.

Compute ∫[x=-infty to -1] (x/(1 +x³))² dx.

Again, using substitution u=1 +x³. For x approaching -infty, u approaches -infty. At x=-1, u=1 + (-1)^3=0.

So the integral becomes ∫[u=-infty to 0] (x² dx)/(u^2).

But x² is positive, and du=3x² dx, so x² dx= du/3.

Thus,

∫[u=-infty to 0] (du/3)/u^2 = (1/3) ∫[u=-infty to 0] u^(-2) du.

The integral of u^(-2) is -1/u.

So,

(1/3) [ -1/u ] from -infty to 0.

At u approaching 0 from the negative side, -1/u approaches positive infinity.

At u approaching -infty, -1/u approaches 0.

So,

(1/3)[ (positive infinity) - 0 ] which diverges to infinity.

So the integral from x=-infty to -1 is infinite, which can't be right for the problem. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only considering the region from x=0 to infinity, which gives V=π/3, which is option E.

But wait, another possibility: perhaps the function is only considered between x=0 and x=1, but that's not indicated. Alternatively, maybe the region is bounded between x=0 and where f(x) meets the x-axis again, but f(x) only meets the x-axis at x=0.

Alternatively, perhaps the function f(x) =x/(1 +x³) is positive for x>0 and negative for x between -1 and 0. So the region bounded by the x-axis and f(x) would consist of two parts: from x=-1 to 0 (where f(x) is below the x-axis) and from x=0 to infinity (where f(x) is above). But the integral from -1 to 0 would give a finite volume, and from 0 to infinity another finite volume, but earlier I found that integrating from x=-1 to 0 gives an infinite volume because of the behavior near x=-1.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the integral from x=-1 to 0. Let me re-examine that.

When x approaches -1 from the right (x → -1+), 1 +x³ approaches 0 from the positive side, so u approaches 0 from the positive side. So the integral from x=-1 to 0 is from u=0 to u=1. But as u approaches 0, 1/u^2 becomes infinite, so the integral diverges. Therefore, including x=-1 to 0 would make the volume infinite, which isn't possible. So perhaps the problem is only considering the region from x=0 to infinity, giving V=π/3.

But looking back at the options, option E is π/3, which would be the answer if we only consider the region from x=0 to infinity. However, let me check the problem statement again: "The region bounded by the x-axis and the function f(x) = x/(1 + x^3)". So maybe the region is where the function is above the x-axis, which is x>0, and the region is bounded because as x approaches infinity, f(x) approaches zero, and at x=0, f(x)=0. So the region is from x=0 to infinity, and the volume is π/3.

But wait, let me double-check my substitution. Maybe I made a mistake there. Let me go through the substitution again.

Let me compute ∫[0, ∞) x²/(1 +x³)^2 dx.

Let u = 1 +x³ → du = 3x² dx → x² dx = du/3.

So,

∫ x²/(1 +x³)^2 dx = ∫ (du/3) / u^2 = (1/3) ∫ u^(-2) du = (1/3)(-u^(-1)) + C = (-1)/(3u) + C.

Evaluated from x=0 (u=1) to x=∞ (u=∞):

At u=∞, (-1)/(3u) → 0.

At u=1, (-1)/(3*1) = -1/3.

So the definite integral is 0 - (-1/3) = 1/3.

Multiply by π: V= π*(1/3)= π/3.

Yes, that's correct. So the volume is π/3, which is option E.
</think>

The volume is found by integrating the function squared from 0 to infinity using the disk method, resulting in a volume of π/3.
