Question:

For the following second-order reversible reaction H_2 + X_2 ^(k)a\rightleftarrows_(k)b 2HX express the thermodynamic equilibrium constant, K, in terms of k_a and k_b.

Options:

A: (k_b / k_a) = K
B: K = k_a + k_b
C: K = (k_b * k_b) / k_a
D: (k_a / k_b) = K
E: K = sqrt(k_a / k_b)
F: K = k_a * k_b
G: K = (k_a - k_b) if k_a > k_b, else K = (k_b - k_a)
H: K = (k_a + k_b) / (k_a * k_b)
I: K = 1 / (k_a + k_b)
J: K = (k_a * k_a) / k_b

Answer:

Okay, so I have this chemistry problem about reversible reactions and equilibrium constants. Let me try to work through it step by step. The reaction given is H₂ + X₂ ⇌ 2HX. It's a second-order reaction, and it's reversible with rate constants k_a for the forward reaction and k_b for the backward reaction.

First, I remember that for a reversible reaction, the equilibrium constant K is the ratio of the forward rate constant to the reverse rate constant. So K should be k_a over k_b, right?

Wait, let me think again. The general form of K for a reaction aA + bB ⇌ cC + dD is K = ( [C]^c [D]^d ) / ( [A]^a [B]^b ). But since the problem is asking to express K in terms of k_a and k_b, I think it's about the relationship between the rate constants and the equilibrium constant.

In a reversible reaction, the rate forward is k_a [H₂][X₂], and the rate backward is k_b [HX]^2. At equilibrium, these two rates are equal. So setting them equal:

k_a [H₂][X₂] = k_b [HX]^2.

To find K, I rearrange this equation. K is [HX]^2 / ([H₂][X₂]) at equilibrium. From the equation above, K = k_a / k_b. So K equals k_a divided by k_b.

Looking at the options, option D is (k_a / k_b) = K, which matches what I derived. Option A is (k_b/k_a) = K, which would be the reciprocal and thus incorrect. The other options don't seem to fit because they involve addition, multiplication, or other operations which don't apply here since K is a ratio of the rate constants.

The equilibrium constant \( K \) for the reaction is the ratio of the forward rate constant \( k_a \) to the reverse rate constant \( k_b \), so \( K = \frac{k_a}{k_b} \).

Answer: D
