Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this product liability question. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand.

Bill bought a can of Sipep from Ajax Minimart. After drinking it, he noticed dead insects on the inside bottom of the can. He's suing Ajax in a strict product liability tort. The question is asking what Bill must prove among the options given.

I remember that product liability has different theories, like negligence, breach of warranty, and strict liability. Since it's a strict liability case, I should focus on the elements required for strict liability.

Strict product liability generally requires that the product was defective, the defect made the product unreasonably dangerous, and the defect caused Bill's injury. Importantly, under strict liability, the plaintiff doesn't have to prove the defendant was negligent; they just need to show the product was defective when it left the seller's hands.

So looking at the options:

Option A: Ajax is a merchant selling Sipep. Well, in strict liability, the defendant must be a seller or distributor. So proving they're a merchant is probably necessary, but maybe it's more about whether they're in the business of selling the product. But I'm not sure if this is one of the things Bill must prove beyond the product being defective.

Option B: Ajax knew or should have known of the defective condition. Wait, in strict liability, the plaintiff doesn't have to show that the defendant knew about the defect. Unlike negligence, strict liability doesn't require knowledge. So Bill might not need to prove this. But I'm a bit confused because sometimes there are cases where if the seller did know, it's easier, but it's not a strict requirement.

Option C: Ajax had prior notice of other similar problems. Similar to B, prior notice isn't required for strict liability. It might be relevant in showing the product was defective, but Bill doesn't have to prove that Ajax had prior notices. It could be part of establishing the defect but isn't a must-prove element.

Option D: Ajax actually placed the dead insects into the can. That sounds like it's shifting blame to the manufacturer. But in strict liability, even if the seller didn't put the insects there, if the product was defective when it left their control, they can be liable. So Bill doesn't need to prove that Ajax put the insects in; just that the product was defective when sold.

Wait, but in this case, the defect is the presence of dead insects. So Bill needs to show that the can was defective when it left Ajax. He doesn't need to show who caused the defect, just that it existed at the time of sale. So the key elements are:

1. The product was defective.
2. The defect caused the injury.
3. The product was used as intended.

So looking back at the options, the question is what Bill must prove "among other things." The main thing is the defect, but the options are more about what else he must show.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. In strict liability, the plaintiff must show that the product was unreasonably dangerous due to a defect. The defendant's knowledge or intent isn't required. So the correct answer can't be B or C because those involve knowledge or prior notice, which aren't required.

Option A: Being a merchant. I think in strict liability, the defendant has to be a seller, so proving that Ajax is a merchant selling Sipep is necessary. Because if someone is selling the product, they can be held strictly liable. So A might be correct.

Option D: Actually placed the insects. No, as I thought earlier, strict liability doesn't require proving that the defendant caused the defect. So D isn't necessary.

So the answer would be A. Because Bill must prove that Ajax is a merchant selling Sipep, making them a proper defendant in a strict liability case.
</think>

In a strict product liability tort action, the plaintiff must establish that the defendant is a merchant selling the product, as this is a fundamental requirement to hold the seller accountable. The other options involve elements like knowledge or prior notice, which are not necessary in strict liability. Therefore, the correct answer is:

A: Ajax is a merchant selling Sipep.

Answer: A
