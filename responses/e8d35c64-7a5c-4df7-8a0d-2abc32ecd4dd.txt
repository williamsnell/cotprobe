Question:

A mother took her five-year-old child to a hospital emergency room for treatment. A doctor on the hospital staff molested the child while treating her. At the time, no one was in the treatment room except the doctor and the child; the mother had left the room to get a cup of coffee. Two weeks later, when the child told her mother what had occurred in the treatment room, the mother suffered severe emotional distress that caused her to become physically ill. In an action against the doctor by the mother on her own behalf to recover for intentional infliction of emotional distress, is the mother likely to prevail?

Options:

A: No, because the mother's emotional distress was not immediate and therefore cannot be attributed to the doctor's actions.
B: No, because the mother was contributorily negligent in leaving the child alone with the doctor during treatment.
C: Yes, because the mother's distress was the natural and foreseeable consequence of the doctor's conduct. 
D: Yes, because the mother was indirectly victimized by the doctor's actions.
E: No, because the mother did not directly suffer physical harm from the doctor's actions.
F: Yes, because the mother has a legal duty to protect her child and the doctor's actions violated that duty.
G: No, because the doctor's actions did not directly cause the mother's distress.
H: Yes, because the doctor's conduct was outrageous.
I: No, because the mother was neither the direct victim of the doctor's conduct nor a contemporaneous witness.
J: Yes, because the mother was indirectly involved in the incident and suffered as a result.

Okay, so I've got this question about tort law, specifically intentional infliction of emotional distress (IIED). Let me try to break it down step by step.

The scenario is that a mother took her five-year-old to the ER. The doctor molested the child while treating her. At the time, the mother wasn't in the room because she went to get coffee. Two weeks later, the child told her, and the mother got severe emotional distress, making her physically ill. Now, the mother is suing the doctor for IIED on her own behalf. The question is whether she's likely to prevail.

I remember that IIED requires that the defendant's conduct was outrageous, intentional, and caused the plaintiff's emotional distress, which must be severe. Also, the distress must be a foreseeable result of the defendant's actions.

Wait, but in this case, the mother wasn't directly the victim. The doctor molested her child. So, the mother is suing based on her own emotional distress. Does she qualify as a plaintiff in an IIED claim?

I think there's a concept called "bystander" liability, but I'm not sure if that applies here. Bystander cases usually involve someone witnessing a traumatic event involving a close family member. For example, if someone sees their spouse being harmed, they might suffer distress. But here, the mother wasn't present when the molestation happened; she found out later.

Then there's the idea of "direct victim" versus "indirect." The mother is the parent, so she's closely related. But she didn't witness it; she found out later. Does that matter?

I also remember that in some jurisdictions, a parent can recover for emotional distress caused by the injury or death of their child. But that's usually under negligent infliction of emotional distress (NIED), not IIED. But this is intentional, so maybe the standards are different.

Another point: the mother's distress was two weeks after the event. Is the timing an issue? I think immediacy isn't always required, but it's a factor. Some courts require that the distress be contemporaneous or at least within a reasonable time.

Looking at the options:

A: No, because the mother's distress wasn't immediate. But I'm not sure if immediacy is a strict requirement. Some jurisdictions allow for a short time lag.

B: No, because she was negligent in leaving the child alone. But contributory negligence might not apply here. The mother had to get coffee; it's not clear if that's negligence. Plus, in some cases, a parent's leaving isn't considered negligence if they had no reason to know the doctor would harm their child.

C: Yes, because the distress was a natural and foreseeable consequence. That sounds plausible. The doctor's intentional act of molesting the child would naturally foresee that the parent would find out and suffer distress.

D: Yes, because the mother was indirectly victimized. Indirect victimization could apply if she's a close relative who suffers as a result of the defendant's act.

E: No, because she didn't suffer physical harm directly from the doctor. But IIED doesn't require physical harm; it's about emotional distress causing physical symptoms. So this might not be the right reason.

F: Yes, because the doctor violated the mother's duty to protect her child. I'm not sure about this. The duty to protect is more about the parent's responsibility, but here the doctor is the one who breached duty towards the child, perhaps.

G: No, because the doctor's actions didn't directly cause the distress. But causation is about whether the event was a result. The mother's distress was caused by learning of the molestation, which the doctor did.

H: Yes, because the conduct was outrageous. The molestation is definitely outrageous, so this is a strong point.

I: No, because she wasn't the direct victim or a contemporary witness. This seems relevant. She wasn't there when it happened, so she's neither a direct victim nor a witness at the time.

J: Yes, because she was indirectly involved and suffered as a result. Indirect involvement could be enough if the law allows for that.

So, putting it together: The key issue is whether the mother can recover for IIED when she wasn't present but found out later. Some jurisdictions allow this for close family members. The conduct was outrageous, so H is a factor.

Looking at the options, C and H seem strong. C says the distress was a natural and foreseeable consequence. H focuses on the outrageousness.

But wait, IIED requires that the defendant's conduct was so extreme that it goes beyond all bounds of decency. The molestation certainly fits that. So H is likely correct.

But some cases require that the plaintiff was either a direct victim or a contemporary witness. If I is correct, then the mother can't recover because she wasn't present. But J says she was indirectly involved, which might cover her situation.

Alternatively, C argues that the distress was a foreseeable consequence, which is a key element. So maybe C is correct.

Wait, but IIED typically requires that the plaintiff was either the direct victim or a bystander present at the scene. The mother wasn't present, so she's not a bystander. So perhaps I is the correct answer, stating she wasn't a direct victim or a contemporary witness.

But some jurisdictions have expanded IIED to allow parents to recover when they find out about harm to their children, even if not present. So it depends on the jurisdiction.

Looking at the options, I is an option: "No, because the mother was neither the direct victim of the doctor's conduct nor a contemporaneous witness."

That seems accurate. She wasn't there, so she wasn't a witness. She's not the direct victim; the child is. So she can't recover under IIED unless there's a specific exception, which I don't think applies here.

So the answer would be I. But wait, some might argue that the mother's distress is a foreseeable consequence, making C correct. But without being a direct victim or witness, she might not have standing.

Alternatively, in some states, a parent can sue for IIED upon discovering harm to their child, but I'm not sure if that's the majority rule.

Alternatively, option J says she was indirectly involved. But I'm not sure about that term. I think the better reasoning is that she wasn't present, so she can't recover. Therefore, the answer is I.

The question revolves around whether the mother can recover for intentional infliction of emotional distress (IIED) after learning of her child's molestation by the doctor. IIED requires that the defendant's conduct was outrageous, intentional, and caused the plaintiff's emotional distress, which must be severe and a foreseeable consequence of the defendant's actions.

In this scenario, the mother was not present during the molestation and only learned of it two weeks later. The key issue is whether she qualifies as a plaintiff in an IIED claim. Generally, IIED claims require the plaintiff to be the direct victim or a contemporaneous witness. The mother was neither, as she was not present during the incident. While the doctor's conduct was undoubtedly outrageous, the mother's absence as a direct victim or witness undermines her claim.

Option I correctly identifies that the mother was neither the direct victim nor a contemporary witness, which disqualifies her from recovering under IIED in this context. Therefore, the answer is:

I
