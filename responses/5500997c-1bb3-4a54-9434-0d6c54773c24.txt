Answer the following multiple choice question, selecting from the answer A through to J. After thinking, reply directly with your answer. 

The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

The President and sole stockholder of a small business negotiated to sell the business to an individual investor. The parties met and signed a "Letter Agreement", which set forth the price, down payment amount, financing terms, the assets to be included, and a host of other pertinent details. The final closing date was not stated, but the purchasers left a down payment of $20,000 with the seller. The letter stated that the terms comprised their essential agreement, but that a formal document would be drafted by the parties' attorneys. Before that happened, the seller returned the check and refused to perform. The investor brought an equity action for specific performance to compel the sale. The equity court ruled that there was a complete and binding contract that must be specifically performed. Will the appellate court likely affirm the lower court's decision?

Options:

A: Yes, because the seller accepted the down payment, indicating acceptance of the agreement.
B: No, because this type of letter is basically a "gentlemen's agreement" that is not intended to be legally binding.
C: No, because the seller has the right to refuse the sale at any time before the final contract is signed.
D: Yes, because a letter of intent is legally binding if it sets forth the price, describes the business and is signed by both parties.
E: No, because the terms of the agreement were not finalized by the parties' attorneys.
F: No, because a letter agreement is not a legally binding document.
G: Yes, because the letter agreement contained all the necessary details for the sale.
H: No, because closing date was left out and the attorneys were supposed to compose the final contract with all of the remaining details put in.
I: Yes, because the buyer left a down payment, signifying their intention to follow through with the purchase.
J: Yes, because where the letter contains all of the essential terms required for a contract, it will be enforced as a contract.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether the appellate court will affirm the lower court's decision that the letter agreement is a binding contract and requires specific performance. Let me break down the facts and the legal principles involved.

First, the parties involved are the President and sole stockholder of a small business who agreed to sell the business to an individual investor. They signed a "Letter Agreement" that included the price, down payment, financing terms, assets, and other details. However, the closing date wasn't specified. The investor paid a down payment of $20,000, which the seller later returned and refused to perform. The investor sued for specific performance, and the lower court ruled in their favor, finding a binding contract that must be enforced.

Now, the question is whether the appellate court will uphold this decision. I remember that contract law generally requires offer, acceptance, consideration, and mutual agreement. But when it comes to written agreements, especially letters of intent or preliminary agreements, the enforceability can sometimes be tricky.

One key point here is that the letter stated that it was their "essential agreement" but that a formal document would be drafted by their attorneys. So, it's a bit ambiguous whether it was intended to be a final and binding contract or just a preliminary step towards a formal contract.

I think the rule is that a letter of intent can be binding if it contains all the essential terms and the parties intended it to be so, even without being a full formal contract. The presence of consideration is also important. In this case, the investor provided a down payment, which might indicate mutual intent to be bound, but the seller returned it, which complicates things.

Looking at the options, option J says that if the letter contains all essential terms, it's enforceable. The letter included price, down payment, financing, assetsâ€”so it seems to cover the basics. But the closing date was missing, which is a term that's usually important in sales contracts. However, sometimes even without a closing date, if the other terms are present and the parties are ready to perform, a court might find it enforceable.

Option A suggests that accepting the down payment indicates acceptance, but the seller returned it, so maybe that's not the case. Option D talks about a letter of intent being binding if it has price, business description, and signatures, which fits here. Option E says the terms weren't finalized by attorneys, but the letter itself might have been sufficient if it had all necessary terms.

Hmm, another angle is that the parties intended to create a binding agreement. The fact that they considered it their essential agreement but would draft a formal document might not negate the binding nature if all terms were agreed upon except for maybe the closing date. But sometimes, having a term like closing date is considered essential, so its absence might make the contract incomplete.

Wait, but in some jurisdictions, a letter of intent is enforceable as a preliminary contract if it's intended to be binding. Since the letter here included price, down payment, etc., and both parties signed, it could be seen as a valid contract. The fact that the seller accepted the down payment (even if they returned it later) might indicate they were initially bound but perhaps changed their mind. But once the down payment was accepted, it could be a form of consideration.

So, looking at the options, J seems to fit because it says the letter contains all the essential terms and will be enforced. Option H says the closing date was left out, so maybe the contract is incomplete. But if the closing date isn't specified, perhaps the court can imply one or enforce the contract with a reasonable time frame.

Alternatively, the fact that the parties intended to have a formal document drafted might mean the letter wasn't meant to be the final agreement. But the presence of the down payment and the court's ruling suggests it was considered a binding contract.

So, the appellate court would likely affirm if the letter had all essential terms. Therefore, the correct answer might be J.

The appellate court is likely to affirm the lower court's decision because the letter agreement contains all the essential terms required for a contract, including price, down payment, and assets, and was signed by both parties, indicating mutual intent to be bound. The absence of a closing date does not necessarily render the agreement incomplete if the other terms are present and the parties were ready to perform. The down payment, though later returned, initially indicated acceptance. Therefore, the letter is enforceable as a contract.

Answer: J
