Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the cost of Mr. Griffin's car insurance based on the information given. Let's break down the details step by step.

First, Mr. Griffin is a 22-year-old single male. That's probably important because younger drivers, especially males, tend to have higher insurance rates due to factors like inexperience. But let's not jump to conclusions yet.

He uses his car strictly for pleasure, which means he's not using it for work or commuting long distances. So maybe he's considered a "pleasure" driver rather than a "commute" or "business" driver. Pleasure driving might mean he's driving less frequently, but I'm not sure how that affects the cost. Maybe it's safer, so lower rates? Or maybe it's not as predictable as commuting, so higher rates? I'm not certain about this.

His insurance coverage includes 25-and-50 liability. Wait, 25/50â€”does that mean $25,000 for bodily injury per person and $50,000 per accident? Or is it 25/50/ something else? Oh, wait, sometimes it's written as 25/50/25, which covers per person, per accident, and property damage. But in this case, the question mentions 25-and-50, so maybe it's 25/50, and the property damage is separate at $10,000. So the liability is 25/50, and property damage is $10k.

He lives in 04 territory. I'm not exactly sure what "04" refers to. Maybe it's a state or region code. I know some states have different insurance requirements and costs. For example, in some states, insurance might be more expensive because of higher accident rates, traffic laws, or other factors. But I'm not sure which state 04 is. Maybe it's New Jersey? Because sometimes states are numbered, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, it could be a typo for "Zone 04," but I'm not sure. This part is a bit confusing.

He has had no accidents. That's a good sign because a clean driving record usually means lower premiums. No accidents, tickets, or other violations would help reduce the cost.

Now, looking at the options, the possible answers are A through J with various dollar amounts. I need to figure out which one is the cost of his coverage.

I remember that insurance costs can vary widely based on factors like age, location, type of use, coverage limits, and driving history. Since he's a young single male, that's a higher-risk category, so the cost might be on the higher side. But without accidents, that could lower the cost.

The liability coverage is 25/50, which is the minimum in many states, but I'm not sure. Higher coverage usually means higher premiums, but 25/50 is relatively low. The property damage is $10k, which is also a standard amount.

If he's in a state where insurance is expensive, like New Jersey or California, the cost might be higher. But if it's a cheaper state, maybe the cost is lower.

Looking at the options, the amounts vary from as low as $37 (option D) up to $210.75 (E). Since he's a young driver, I would expect the cost to be higher than average, so maybe in the higher range. But without knowing his state, it's tricky.

Wait, the question says he's in 04 territory. Maybe that's a typo for "Zone 04," but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's referring to a specific region with known insurance rates. Alternatively, maybe it's a placeholder and the actual cost is based on the coverage.

Alternatively, maybe the cost can be calculated based on typical rates for such a policy. Let's think about average costs. For a 25/50 liability and $10k property damage, a single 22-year-old with no accidents might pay around $100 to $200 a month. But the options include $167.45 (A), $183.30 (C), $210.75 (E), and others.

Alternatively, maybe the cost is based on a specific formula or standard rates. For example, sometimes the base premium for minimum coverage is around $80 or so, but with higher coverage, it goes up. But I'm not certain.

Wait, another thought: sometimes, the cost can be calculated by multiplying the coverage by a certain rate. For example, 25/50 liability might cost around $100 a year, but that's just a guess. But the options here are monthly or annual? The question doesn't specify, but the options are in the hundreds or lower, so perhaps they're monthly premiums.

If he's a high-risk driver, the cost would be higher. Since he's 22 and single, that's high risk, but with no accidents, maybe the cost is moderate.

Looking at the options, the higher numbers are E ($210.75), A ($167.45), C ($183.30), and J ($150.20). The lower ones are in the $37 to $125 range. I'm leaning towards a higher cost because of his age and gender, but without knowing the exact state, it's hard.

Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is one of the mid-range options. Let me think about typical insurance costs for a 22-year-old male with 25/50 and $10k PD. I think it's around $150 to $200 per month. So options A ($167.45), C ($183.30), E ($210.75), and J ($150.20) fit that range.

But I'm not sure. Maybe the correct answer is A: $167.45. Or perhaps it's C, which is higher. Alternatively, maybe it's E, but that seems high. Or J: $150.20.

Wait, another angle: sometimes insurance companies offer discounts for good driving records. Since he has no accidents, that could lower the cost. So maybe the premium is on the lower side within the possible range.

If the average for someone his age is around $180, but with a discount, it might be $167.45. So maybe option A is correct.

Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is $183.30, which is option C. But I'm not certain.

I think I'll go with option A: $167.45 because it's a common figure I've heard before for similar policies, but I'm not entirely sure.

The cost of Mr. Griffin's insurance is likely influenced by his age, gender, driving history, and coverage limits. As a 22-year-old single male with no accidents, the premium is expected to be moderate to high. Considering the options and typical rates, the most plausible answer is **A: $167.45**.
