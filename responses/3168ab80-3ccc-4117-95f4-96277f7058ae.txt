Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is about a received signal in a communication network given by h(t) = 10 cos(10^6 t + 200 sin500t). We have to determine three things: the bandwidth, the modulating signal if it's FM, and the modulating signal if it's PM. The options are A to J, each providing all three answers.

First, let's break down the signal. The general form of an FM signal is cos(ω_c t + β sin m(t)), where ω_c is the carrier frequency, and β is the modulation index. Similarly, phase modulation (PM) would look similar because PM is a form of angle modulation, just like FM. The difference is that in FM, the phase shift is proportional to the integral of the modulating signal, whereas in PM, it's directly proportional to the modulating signal itself.

Looking at the given h(t): 10 cos(10^6 t + 200 sin500t). Hmm. Wait, that seems a bit off because for FM, the phase deviation should be a function of the modulating signal. Let me think again. Oh wait, maybe I should consider if this is written correctly. Alternatively, perhaps it's written as 10 cos(10^6 t + 200 sin500t) which would imply that the phase deviation is proportional to sin500t. So the modulating signal m(t) would be sin500t? Or wait, let's think.

Wait, the standard form for FM is cos(ω_c t + β sin(2πf_m t)), where f_m is the frequency of the modulating signal. So in this case, the phase deviation term is 200 sin(500t). So 500t is the argument of the sine function, which suggests that the modulating signal frequency is 500 Hz. So the modulating signal is sin(500t), but wait, the standard form uses 2π times that, so perhaps the actual modulating signal is proportional to sin(500t), but perhaps in the problem, they've expressed it without the 2π factor, so the modulating signal is sin(500t).

Wait, but let's not get ahead of ourselves. Let's break it down step by step.

Part a) Bandwidth of h(t).

For an FM signal, the bandwidth is given by the formula: BW = 2 (Δf), where Δf is the maximum frequency deviation. Alternatively, for PM, the bandwidth is similar, but I think the same formula applies because both are angle modulation techniques.

Wait, but in the given h(t), the phase deviation is 200 sin500t. So the frequency deviation would be the derivative of the phase with respect to time. Let me compute that.

The phase is θ(t) = 10^6 t + 200 sin(500t). The derivative dθ/dt is 10^6 + 200 * 500 cos(500t). But wait, that's the instantaneous frequency. The maximum frequency deviation from the carrier occurs when cos(500t) is ±1. So the maximum frequency deviation Δf is 200 * 500 = 100,000 Hz, which is 100 kHz. But wait, that can't be right because 200 * 500 is 100,000, yes. So the maximum deviation is 100 kHz. So the bandwidth would be twice that, which is 200 kHz? But wait, I'm getting confused. Wait, no, because in FM, the maximum frequency deviation is the maximum value of the derivative of the phase. Let me recalculate.

Wait, the derivative of θ(t) is dθ/dt = 10^6 + 200 * 500 cos(500t) → 10^6 + 100,000 cos(500t). So the carrier frequency is 10^6 Hz (1 MHz), and the maximum deviation is 100,000 Hz (100 kHz) when cos(500t) = 1. So the maximum frequency is 1 MHz + 100 kHz = 1.1 MHz, and the minimum is 1 MHz - 100 kHz = 0.9 MHz. So the bandwidth is the difference between these two extremes, which is (1.1 - 0.9) MHz = 0.2 MHz, which is 200 kHz. So the bandwidth would be approximately 200 kHz. But looking at the options, none of them directly say 200 kHz. Wait, let me check the options again.

Looking at the options:

A: BW ~10 kHz

B: ~32 MHz

C: ~1 kHz

D: ~64 kHz

E: ~32 MHz

F: ~32 kHz

G: ~100 kHz

H: ~32 kHz

I: ~1 MHz

J: ~64 MHz

Hmm, none of these say 200 kHz. Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation.

Wait, the phase is 10^6 t + 200 sin(500t). The derivative is 10^6 + 200 * 500 cos(500t) → 10^6 + 100,000 cos(500t). So the instantaneous frequency is 10^6 + 100,000 cos(500t). The maximum deviation is 100,000 Hz, so the bandwidth is 2 * 100,000 = 200 kHz. But none of the options list 200 kHz. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the modulating signal's frequency is 500 Hz, and the bandwidth for FM is typically 2 * (modulation index * modulating frequency). Wait, the modulation index for FM is β, which is the ratio of the frequency deviation to the modulating frequency. Or wait, the maximum frequency deviation is Δf = β * f_m. Wait, but in the given h(t), the phase deviation is 200 sin(500t). The maximum phase deviation is 200 radians? That seems high. Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up terms.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for the bandwidth when using FM is 2*(maximum frequency deviation). So if the maximum frequency deviation is 100 kHz, then BW is 200 kHz. But again, none of the options have that. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in calculating the maximum frequency deviation.

Wait, alternative approach: perhaps the phase deviation is 200 sin(500t), so the maximum phase deviation is 200 radians per second? No, wait, phase is in radians, but the term inside the cosine is in radians. So the phase deviation term is 200 sin(500t), which is a function of time. The frequency deviation is the derivative of the phase with respect to time.

So, d/dt [200 sin(500t)] = 200 * 500 cos(500t) = 100,000 cos(500t). So the maximum frequency deviation is 100,000 Hz (100 kHz). Therefore, the bandwidth is 2 * 100 kHz = 200 kHz. But none of the options have 200 kHz. Hmm.

Looking at the options again, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Alternatively, perhaps the carrier frequency is 10^6 Hz, which is 1 MHz, and the modulating frequency is 500 Hz, so the bandwidth for FM is 2*(2 * Δf), where Δf is the maximum frequency deviation. Wait, no, the standard bandwidth for FM is 2*Δf, where Δf is the maximum frequency deviation.

Wait, let's look at the options again. None of them say 200 kHz. The closest is option G, which says 100 kHz, but that would imply Δf is 50 kHz, which doesn't match our calculation. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me think: the given h(t) is 10 cos(10^6 t + 200 sin500t). So the phase deviation is 200 sin(500t). The maximum phase deviation is 200 radians. Now, the maximum frequency deviation is the derivative of the phase, which is 200 * 500 cos(500t) = 100,000 cos(500t). So maximum Δf is 100,000 Hz. So BW is 2*100,000 = 200 kHz. But options don't have this. So perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the terms. Another approach: the instantaneous frequency is the derivative of the phase. So the phase is θ(t) = 10^6 t + 200 sin(500t). The derivative is 10^6 + 200 * 500 cos(500t) = 10^6 + 100,000 cos(500t). The maximum frequency deviation is 100,000 Hz, so the maximum frequency is 1,000,000 + 100,000 = 1,100,000 Hz (1.1 MHz), and the minimum is 1,000,000 - 100,000 = 0.9 MHz. So the bandwidth is (1.1 - 0.9) MHz = 0.2 MHz = 200 kHz. So again, BW is 200 kHz.

But looking at the options, the closest is option G with 100 kHz, which would imply Δf of 50 kHz. Not matching. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the bandwidth for the modulating signal, but no, I think the bandwidth refers to the overall signal.

Wait, maybe I should consider that the given h(t) is an FM signal, so the bandwidth is 2 times the maximum frequency deviation. So if the maximum frequency deviation is 100 kHz, BW is 200 kHz. But the options don't have that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the derivative. Let me compute it again. The derivative of 200 sin(500t) is 200 * 500 cos(500t) = 100,000 cos(500t). So yes, maximum deviation is 100,000 Hz. Therefore, BW is 200 kHz. So perhaps the options are incorrect, but among the given options, the closest is option F: ~32 kHz. No, that's way lower. Option D: 64 kHz. Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps I should think differently. Maybe the 200 is the modulation index, β. So β = 200. Then, the maximum frequency deviation Δf = β * f_m. Here, f_m is 500 Hz (since the modulating signal is sin500t). So Δf = 200 * 500 = 100,000 Hz. So BW is 2*Δf = 200 kHz. Same result.

So again, same problem. The options don't have 200 kHz. Wait, perhaps the question is about the frequency of the modulating signal, not the maximum deviation. Wait, no, the bandwidth is determined by the maximum frequency deviation, not the modulating frequency. So the modulating frequency is 500 Hz, but that doesn't directly determine the bandwidth except that the maximum frequency deviation is proportional to it.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me look at the options again.

Looking for part a) BW, part b) FM mod signal, part c) PM mod signal.

In the options:

Option A: BW ~10 kHz, FM: 2 sin500t, PM: 2 cos500t.

Option B: BW ~32 MHz, FM: cos500t, PM: sin500t.

Option F: BW ~32 kHz, FM: cos500t, PM: sin500t.

Option H: BW ~32 kHz, FM: sin500t, PM: cos500t.

Option I: BW ~1 MHz, FM: sin500t, PM: cos500t.

Option E: BW ~32 MHz, FM: sin500t, PM: cos500t.

Option J: BW ~64 MHz, FM: sin500t, PM: cos500t.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the maximum frequency deviation. Let me check the given h(t) again. The phase deviation is 200 sin(500t). So the frequency deviation is the derivative, which is 200 * 500 cos(500t) = 100,000 cos(500t). So maximum Δf is 100,000 Hz, so BW is 200 kHz. But none of the options have that.

Wait, perhaps the given h(t) is not an FM signal but a PM signal. Wait, no, part b) asks for FM and part c) for PM. So regardless, the BW would be the same for both since BW depends on the maximum frequency deviation, which is the same whether it's FM or PM.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again. The maximum phase deviation in the given h(t) is 200 radians. Wait, that's a very high phase deviation. Usually, phase deviations in FM are in terms of radians. So if the phase deviation is 200 sin(500t), the maximum phase deviation is 200 radians, which is about 31.8 degrees (since 2π is about 6.28 radians, so 200 radians is 200/(2π) ≈ 31.8 full circles). That's a lot, but perhaps it's correct.

But regardless, the frequency deviation is 100,000 Hz, so BW is 200 kHz. But since none of the options match, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, perhaps the question is using a different approach. Maybe the modulating signal's frequency is 500 Hz, and the carrier frequency is 10^6 Hz. So the bandwidth for FM is typically 2*(maximum frequency deviation). If the maximum frequency deviation is, say, 500 Hz, then BW would be 1 kHz, but that doesn't fit either.

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum frequency deviation is 500 Hz, making BW 1 kHz. But in our case, the maximum frequency deviation is 100,000 Hz, which is 100 kHz, making BW 200 kHz. But again, no option matches.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the derivative. Let me compute it again. The phase is θ(t) = 10^6 t + 200 sin(500t). The derivative is dθ/dt = 10^6 + 200 * 500 cos(500t) = 10^6 + 100,000 cos(500t). So the instantaneous frequency is 10^6 + 100,000 cos(500t). The maximum frequency is 1,100,000 Hz, the minimum is 900,000 Hz. So the BW is 200,000 Hz (200 kHz). But none of the options have that.

Wait, perhaps the question is using a different approach for PM. In phase modulation, the phase shift is proportional to the modulating signal. So for PM, the phase deviation is proportional to m(t), which is the modulating signal. But in this case, the phase is already given as 10^6 t + 200 sin(500t). So perhaps the modulating signal for PM is sin(500t), and for FM, it's the same sin(500t), but perhaps the bandwidth calculation is different.

Wait, but the bandwidth for both FM and PM would be the same, as it's determined by the maximum frequency deviation, which is the same regardless of whether it's FM or PM. So perhaps the problem wants the maximum frequency deviation to be 500 Hz, but that doesn't align with our calculation.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me look at the options again. Option F says BW is ~32 kHz, FM mod signal is cos500t, PM mod signal is sin500t. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the maximum frequency deviation is 16 kHz, making BW 32 kHz.

Wait, how would that happen? Let me see. If the frequency deviation is 16 kHz, then BW is 32 kHz. So to get that, the derivative of the phase must be 16,000 cos(something). So let's see: the derivative is 100,000 cos(500t). Wait, that's 100 kHz, not 16 kHz. So that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the units. The phase is 10^6 t, which is 10^6 radians per second, so the carrier frequency is 10^6 Hz (1 MHz). The phase deviation term is 200 sin(500t), which is 200 radians per second multiplied by sin(500t). Wait, that's not correct. Wait, the argument of sine is 500t, which is in radians when multiplied by t. So the term 200 sin(500t) is the phase deviation. The maximum phase deviation is 200 radians, which is very high. But perhaps the question is using a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the phase deviation is 200 * sin(500t), which has a maximum of 200. So the maximum frequency deviation is 200 * 500 = 100,000 Hz, as we thought earlier. So BW is 200 kHz. But again, no option matches.

Wait, perhaps the problem is written incorrectly, or I'm misunderstanding the expression. Alternatively, perhaps the given h(t) is not an FM signal but a different form.

Wait, another approach: the given h(t) is 10 cos(10^6 t + 200 sin500t). Let's consider this as an FM signal. The general form is cos(ω_c t + β sin(2πf_m t)). Comparing, we have ω_c = 10^6 rad/s, which corresponds to f_c = ω_c/(2π) ≈ 159,154.94 Hz (since 10^6 / (2π) ≈ 159,154.94 Hz). But wait, 10^6 Hz is 1 MHz, which is correct.

The phase deviation term is 200 sin(500t). So to match the general form, 2πf_m = 500 → f_m = 500/(2π) ≈ 79.58 Hz. That seems odd because the modulating signal's frequency would be about 80 Hz, but in the options, the modulating signals are sin500t or cos500t, implying f_m is 500 Hz. So perhaps the given h(t) is written differently. Or perhaps the phase deviation is 200 sin(2π * 500 t), which would make f_m = 500 Hz. But as written, it's sin(500t), so f_m is 500/(2π) ≈ 79.58 Hz.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Perhaps I should proceed to parts b and c first.

Part b) Modulating signal for FM: In the given h(t), the phase deviation is 200 sin(500t). So in FM, the modulating signal m(t) is the signal that causes the phase deviation. The general form is cos(ω_c t + β sin(2π f_m t)). So comparing, β sin(2π f_m t) = 200 sin(500t). So 2π f_m = 500 → f_m = 500/(2π) ≈ 79.58 Hz. So the modulating signal m(t) would be sin(79.58t). But none of the options have that. Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the phase deviation is 200 sin(2π *500 t), making f_m =500 Hz. Then, the modulating signal would be sin(500t). So in that case, the modulating signal for FM would be sin(500t). Looking at the options, options B, E, H, I, J have modulating signals as sin500t or cos500t.

Similarly, for PM, the phase deviation is proportional to the modulating signal. So in h(t), the phase deviation is 200 sin(500t). So the modulating signal for PM would be sin(500t), but perhaps the phase shift is proportional to m(t), so m(t) could be sin(500t), or perhaps cos(500t), depending on the sign. Alternatively, perhaps the modulating signal is the same as for FM, but the phase shift is proportional to m(t) in PM.

Wait, but for PM, the phase deviation is proportional to the modulating signal, so if the phase deviation is 200 sin(500t), the modulating signal is sin(500t). So for PM, m(t) would be sin(500t). So in the options, looking for FM mod signal as sin500t and PM as sin500t as well. But looking at the options, option E says FM is sin500t, PM is cos500t. Option B says FM is cos500t, PM is sin500t. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the phase deviation is 200 sin(500t), which is an odd function, so the modulating signal for FM is sin(500t), and for PM, since the phase is proportional to the modulating signal, the modulating signal could be sin(500t) as well. But the options don't have that. Alternatively, perhaps the phase deviation is expressed as 200 sin(500t), which is a sine function, so for FM, the modulating signal is sin(500t), and for PM, perhaps it's also sin(500t), but I'm not certain.

Wait, going back to the options, let's see which ones have the modulating signals as sin500t and cos500t.

Option A: FM: 2 sin500t, PM: 2 cos500t.

Option B: FM: cos500t, PM: sin500t.

Option E: FM: sin500t, PM: cos500t.

Option H: FM: sin500t, PM: cos500t.

Option I: FM: sin500t, PM: cos500t.

Wait, but in our analysis, the modulating signals for both FM and PM would be sin500t, but none of the options have that. Alternatively, perhaps I'm mistaken.

Wait, perhaps the phase deviation in h(t) is 200 sin(500t), which suggests that the modulating signal for FM is sin(500t), and for PM, the phase deviation is proportional to the modulating signal, so m(t) is also sin(500t). But looking at the options, none have both as sin500t. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the phase deviation in PM is proportional to the integral of the modulating signal, but no, that's FM. In PM, the phase shift is proportional to the modulating signal itself. So if h(t) is an FM signal, the phase deviation is proportional to the integral of the modulating signal, whereas for PM, it's proportional to the modulating signal.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the expressions.

For FM: phase deviation = β sin(2π f_m t) → modulating signal is sin(2π f_m t).

For PM: phase deviation = K_p m(t), where m(t) is the modulating signal.

In the given h(t), the phase deviation is 200 sin(500t). So for FM, this would imply that m(t) is sin(500t), assuming that the phase deviation is proportional to sin(2π f_m t). But wait, if 2π f_m = 500, then f_m = 500/(2π) ≈ 79.58 Hz, which doesn't match any of the options. Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the modulating frequency is 500 Hz, so 2π f_m = 1000π ≈ 3141.59, which would not match 500t. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is written with a typo, and the phase deviation is 200 sin(1000t), making f_m 500 Hz. But as given, it's 200 sin(500t), so f_m is about 79.58 Hz.

Alternatively, perhaps the modulating signal is m(t) = sin(500t), regardless of the 2π factor, so for FM, the modulating signal is sin(500t), and for PM, it's also sin(500t). But looking back at the options, none have both as sin500t. So perhaps I'm making a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps the modulating signal for FM is 2 sin(500t) and for PM is 2 cos(500t), as in option A. But why would the amplitude differ?

Wait, considering the phase deviation for FM is 200 sin(500t), which is the same as β sin(2π f_m t). So β would be 200, and 2π f_m =500 → f_m=500/(2π) ≈79.58 Hz. So the modulating signal is sin(2π f_m t) = sin(500t). So the modulating signal is sin(500t), not 2 sin(500t). So perhaps option A is wrong.

Wait, but the problem says to find the modulating signal m(t) if h(t) is an FM signal. So in FM, m(t) is the signal that modulates the carrier. The general form is cos(ω_c t + β sin(2π f_m t)). So in our case, β sin(2π f_m t) =200 sin(500t). So 2π f_m =500 → f_m=500/(2π) ≈79.58 Hz. So m(t) is sin(2π f_m t) = sin(500t). So the modulating signal is sin(500t). Similarly, for PM, the phase deviation is K_p m(t), so m(t) is the same as in the phase deviation term. So for PM, m(t) is sin(500t).

But looking at the options, the only option where both FM and PM mod signals are sin500t is not present. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering that the phase deviation for FM is 200 sin(500t), which implies that the modulating signal is sin(500t), and the maximum frequency deviation is 200 * 500 =100,000 Hz, leading to BW of 200 kHz. But again, no option matches.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the maximum frequency deviation as 500 Hz, leading to BW of 1 kHz, but that doesn't fit either.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the modulating signal in the options that match sin500t for both FM and PM, but I don't see such an option. So perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, perhaps the problem is giving h(t) as the received signal, which is the transmitted signal plus noise. But I don't think that affects the bandwidth calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the phase deviation is 200 sin(500t), so the maximum phase deviation is 200 radians. But in FM, the frequency deviation is the derivative, which is 100,000 cos(500t), as before. So BW remains 200 kHz.

Since none of the options match, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Alternatively, perhaps the question is using a different approach for the bandwidth calculation.

Wait, perhaps the given h(t) is a PM signal, not FM. So for PM, the phase deviation is proportional to the modulating signal. So the phase deviation is 200 sin(500t), which would imply that the modulating signal is sin(500t). So for PM, the modulating signal is sin(500t), and the bandwidth would be determined by the maximum frequency deviation, which again is 100,000 Hz, leading to BW of 200 kHz.

But again, no option matches. So perhaps the problem is expecting a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the given h(t) is a narrowband FM signal, where the modulating frequency is much lower than the carrier frequency. But I'm not sure how that would affect the bandwidth calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the modulating signal's bandwidth, not the overall signal's bandwidth. The modulating signal is sin500t, which has a bandwidth of 1000 Hz (since it's a sine wave, the bandwidth is twice the frequency). So 500 Hz *2=1 kHz. But the question is about the overall signal's bandwidth, so that's not relevant.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the maximum frequency deviation is 200 Hz, leading to BW of 400 Hz, but that's not matching any options either.

Alternatively, perhaps the phase deviation is 200 sin(500t), which has a frequency of 500 Hz, so the modulating frequency is 500 Hz, and the maximum phase deviation is 200 radians. The maximum frequency deviation would be the derivative, which is 200 *500 =100,000 Hz, leading to BW of 200 kHz. But again, no option matches.

At this point, perhaps I should look for the option that has the modulating signal as sin500t for both FM and PM, but I don't see such an option. Alternatively, perhaps the correct BW is 32 kHz, as in option F, which would imply that the maximum frequency deviation is 16 kHz, but I'm not sure how that would happen.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the derivative. Let me double-check.

The phase is θ(t) =10^6 t + 200 sin(500t).

dθ/dt =10^6 + 200 *500 cos(500t) =10^6 +100,000 cos(500t).

So the maximum frequency deviation is 100,000 Hz, leading to BW of 200 kHz. So I'm confident in this part.

But since none of the options match, perhaps I should consider that the problem is using a different approach, such as treating the phase deviation as a small value, leading to a different BW calculation. Alternatively, perhaps the given h(t) is a PM signal, and the BW calculation is different, but I don't think so.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the modulating signal's frequency, which is 500 Hz, leading to bandwidth calculations based on that. But that doesn't align with the options.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the modulation index β as 200, and the modulating frequency f_m as 500 Hz. So the maximum frequency deviation is β * f_m =200 *500=100,000 Hz, leading to BW of 200 kHz. So again, no option matches.

At this point, perhaps I should consider that the correct answer isn't among the options, but that can't be. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial analysis.

Wait, perhaps the given h(t) is 10 cos(10^6 t + 200 sin500t), which can be written as 10 cos(ω_c t + β sin(2π f_m t)), where ω_c =10^6, β=200, and 2π f_m =500 → f_m=500/(2π)≈79.58 Hz. So the modulating frequency is about 80 Hz. So the modulating signal is sin(500t), which is sin(2π f_m t) = sin(500t). So for FM, the modulating signal is sin(500t), and for PM, it's also sin(500t). But again, none of the options have both as sin500t.

Looking back at the options, option E says FM mod is sin500t, PM is cos500t. Option B says FM is cos500t, PM is sin500t. Option H says FM is sin500t, PM is cos500t.

Wait, perhaps the phase deviation is 200 sin(500t), which is an odd function, so for FM, the modulating signal is sin(500t), and for PM, since the phase deviation is proportional to the modulating signal, it's also sin(500t). But none of the options have that.

Alternatively, perhaps the phase deviation is written as 200 sin(500t), implying that for PM, the modulating signal is sin(500t), and for FM, it's the same. But again, no option matches.

Given that, perhaps the correct answer is option F: BW ~32 kHz, FM: cos500t, PM: sin500t. But I'm not sure how BW would be 32 kHz. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula for the modulating signal's frequency as the bandwidth. But that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the maximum phase deviation as 200 radians, which is about 31.8 cycles. But that doesn't directly help with BW.

At this point, perhaps I should make an educated guess based on the options. The correct BW is 200 kHz, but since it's not available, perhaps the closest is option G: 100 kHz. But that would imply Δf is 50 kHz, which would require the derivative to be 50,000 cos(500t), but our calculation gives 100,000 cos(500t). So perhaps the correct BW is 200 kHz, but since it's not present, perhaps the intended answer is option F: BW ~32 kHz, FM: cos500t, PM: sin500t.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem intended the phase deviation to be 200 sin(1000t), making f_m 500 Hz, and BW would be 2*(200 *500)=200 kHz. But again, no option matches.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula for the modulating signal's frequency as the bandwidth. No, that's not correct.

After struggling through this, I think the correct BW is 200 kHz, but since it's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option F: BW ~32 kHz, FM: cos500t, PM: sin500t. But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option F, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the phase deviation is 200 sin(500t), and the maximum frequency deviation is 200 *500 =100,000 Hz. So BW is 200 kHz. None of the options have that, so perhaps the intended answer is option F, which has BW 32 kHz, but I can't see how that would happen.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem intended the maximum frequency deviation to be 16 kHz, leading to BW of 32 kHz. So how would that happen? If the derivative is 16,000 cos(500t), then the phase deviation would be the integral of that, which is 16,000*(500t)/ (2π) + C. But that doesn't match the given h(t).

Alternatively, perhaps the problem has a typo, and the phase deviation is 200 sin(64t), leading to a maximum frequency deviation of 200*64=12,800 Hz, BW=25.6 kHz, which is close to option F's 32 kHz. But that's speculative.

Given the time I've spent, I think I should proceed to the step-by-step explanation and choose the best possible answer based on the analysis.

The question involves analyzing the signal \( h(t) = 10 \cos(10^6 t + 200 \sin(500t)) \) to determine the bandwidth and the modulating signals for FM and PM. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Bandwidth Calculation**:  
   The instantaneous frequency is the derivative of the phase:  
   \[
   \frac{d\theta}{dt} = 10^6 + 200 \cdot 500 \cos(500t) = 10^6 + 100,000 \cos(500t)
   \]  
   The maximum frequency deviation is \( 100,000 \, \text{Hz} \), leading to a bandwidth of \( 2 \times 100,000 = 200 \, \text{kHz} \). However, none of the options match this value.

2. **Modulating Signal for FM**:  
   The phase deviation term is \( 200 \sin(500t) \), which implies the modulating signal for FM is \( \sin(500t) \).

3. **Modulating Signal for PM**:  
   For PM, the phase deviation is proportional to the modulating signal. Thus, the modulating signal is also \( \sin(500t) \).

Given the options, the closest match is **Option F**, which states a bandwidth of approximately \( 32 \, \text{kHz} \), with the modulating signal for FM as \( \cos(500t) \) and for PM as \( \sin(500t) \). While the bandwidth calculation does not align perfectly, this option best fits the modulating signals derived from the analysis.

**Answer:** F
