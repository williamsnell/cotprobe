Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here about a parallelogram ABCD. The question says that angle B is 110 degrees, and they're asking for the measure of angle C. Hmm, I remember that parallelograms have some properties related to their angles.

Wait, right, in a parallelogram, opposite angles are equal. So that means angle A equals angle C, and angle B equals angle D. But wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again. Parallelogram properties: opposite sides are equal and parallel, and opposite angles are equal. So angle A equals angle C, and angle B equals angle D. But what about adjacent angles? Oh right, adjacent angles in a parallelogram are supplementary. That means they add up to 180 degrees because the sides are parallel, and the angles are same-side interior angles.

So, if angle B is 110 degrees, then angle C, which is next to angle B, should be supplementary to it. So angle B plus angle C equals 180 degrees. Let me write that down: 110 + angle C = 180. To find angle C, I subtract 110 from 180, which gives 70 degrees. Wait, but no, wait a second. Is angle C opposite angle B or adjacent?

Wait, in a parallelogram, the angles are labeled in order, so ABCD would have angles A, B, C, D in sequence. So angle B is between sides AB and BC, and angle C is between sides BC and CD. So angle B and angle C are consecutive, meaning they are adjacent and should add up to 180 degrees because the sides AB and CD are parallel, and BC is a transversal. So yeah, same-side interior angles, so they should be supplementary.

So angle C would be 180 - 110 = 70 degrees. Wait, but wait, that can't be right because looking at the options, 70 is option G, but another thought: in a parallelogram, consecutive angles are supplementary, so yes, that's correct. So angle C is 70 degrees.

Wait a second, but I'm getting confused because sometimes I might mix up adjacent and opposite. Let me visualize a parallelogram. Let's say points A, B, C, D are arranged in order, forming the parallelogram. So angle B is at point B, and angle C is at point C. Since in a parallelogram, consecutive angles are supplementary, angle B plus angle C must equal 180 degrees. So that's 110 + angle C = 180, so angle C is 70 degrees.

Alternatively, since opposite angles are equal, angle A equals angle C, and angle B equals angle D. But that's not directly helpful here unless I'm trying to find another angle. Wait, no, the question is only about angle C, so the adjacent angle to B is C, so they must add up to 180. Therefore, angle C is 70 degrees. So the correct answer should be option G, which is 70 degrees.

The measure of angle C in parallelogram ABCD is 70 degrees because consecutive angles in a parallelogram are supplementary. 

Answer: G
