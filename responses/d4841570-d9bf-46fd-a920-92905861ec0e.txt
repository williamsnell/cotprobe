Okay, so I need to figure out which pay schedule is better for Loretta Gould. Let's see, she has two options. The manager estimates her sales will be about $80,000 in the first year. I'll need to calculate the total earnings for each schedule and then compare them.

First, let's look at Schedule (1). She gets a salary of $8,000 plus 1% commission on sales. So her commission would be 1% of $80,000. Let me calculate that: 1% of 80,000 is 0.01 * 80,000 = $800. So her total earnings would be her salary plus commission: $8,000 + $800 = $8,800.

Now, Schedule (2) is a bit trickier. She gets a salary of $5,800 plus a 5% commission, but only on sales over $30,000. So first, I need to find out how much her sales exceed $30,000. Her total sales are $80,000, so the amount over $30,000 is $80,000 - $30,000 = $50,000. Now, she gets 5% commission on that $50,000. Let me calculate 5% of 50,000: that's 0.05 * 50,000 = $2,500. So her total earnings under Schedule (2) would be her salary plus commission: $5,800 + $2,500 = $8,300.

Wait, so Schedule (1) gives her $8,800 and Schedule (2) gives her $8,300. That means Schedule (1) is better. Now, how much better is it? $8,800 minus $8,300 equals $500. So Schedule (1) is better by $500.

Looking at the options, I need to find which one matches this. The options are:

H: Schedule (1) is better by $500.

So the answer should be H.

The total earnings under Schedule (1) are $8,800, while under Schedule (2), they are $8,300. Schedule (1) is better by $500.

Answer: H
