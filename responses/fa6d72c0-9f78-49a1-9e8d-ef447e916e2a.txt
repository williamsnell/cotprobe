Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the value of a polynomial f(t) = a + bt + ct² at t = -1. The polynomial passes through three points: (1, -1), (2, 3), and (3, 13). I need to figure out what f(-1) is by determining the coefficients a, b, and c first.

Hmm, let me start by writing down the equations based on the given points. Since f(t) is a quadratic, it has three coefficients: a, b, and c. Each point will give me an equation when I plug in the t-value and the corresponding f(t) value.

So for the point (1, -1), substituting t=1 and f(t)=-1 gives:
a + b(1) + c(1)² = -1
Which simplifies to:
a + b + c = -1  ... (Equation 1)

Next, for the point (2, 3), substituting t=2 and f(t)=3:
a + b(2) + c(2)² = 3
Which becomes:
a + 2b + 4c = 3  ... (Equation 2)

Then, for the point (3, 13), substituting t=3 and f(t)=13:
a + b(3) + c(3)² = 13
Which is:
a + 3b + 9c = 13  ... (Equation 3)

Now I have three equations:

1) a + b + c = -1
2) a + 2b + 4c = 3
3) a + 3b + 9c = 13

I need to solve these equations to find a, b, and c.

Let me subtract Equation 1 from Equation 2 to eliminate a. 

Equation 2 - Equation 1:
(a + 2b + 4c) - (a + b + c) = 3 - (-1)
Simplify:
a - a + 2b - b + 4c - c = 4
Which gives:
b + 3c = 4  ... (Equation 4)

Similarly, subtract Equation 2 from Equation 3 to eliminate a again.

Equation 3 - Equation 2:
(a + 3b + 9c) - (a + 2b + 4c) = 13 - 3
Simplify:
a - a + 3b - 2b + 9c -4c = 10
Which gives:
b + 5c = 10  ... (Equation 5)

Now I have two equations with b and c:

Equation 4: b + 3c = 4
Equation 5: b + 5c = 10

I can subtract Equation 4 from Equation 5 to eliminate b.

Equation 5 - Equation 4:
(b + 5c) - (b + 3c) = 10 - 4
Simplify:
b - b +5c -3c =6
Which gives:
2c =6
So, c =3.

Now plug c=3 into Equation 4 to find b.

Equation 4: b +3(3)=4 → b +9=4 → b=4-9 → b=-5.

Now, with b=-5 and c=3, plug into Equation 1 to find a.

Equation 1: a + (-5) +3 =-1 → a -2 =-1 → a=1.

So the polynomial is f(t)=1 -5t +3t².

Now, I need to find f(-1).

f(-1) =1 +5(1) +3(1) → Wait, wait. Let me compute it correctly.

Wait, f(t)=1 -5t +3t². So:

f(-1) =1 + (-5)(-1) +3*(-1)^2.
Compute each term:

1 is 1.

-5*(-1)=5.

3*(-1)^2=3*(1)=3.

So adding them up: 1 +5 +3 =9.

Let me check the options. Option G is 9. So the answer should be G.

To determine \( f(-1) \) for the quadratic polynomial \( f(t) = a + bt + ct^2 \) passing through the points (1, -1), (2, 3), and (3, 13), we first set up three equations based on these points:

1. \( a + b + c = -1 \)  
2. \( a + 2b + 4c = 3 \)  
3. \( a + 3b + 9c = 13 \)  

Subtracting Equation 1 from Equation 2 gives \( b + 3c = 4 \). Subtracting Equation 2 from Equation 3 gives \( b + 5c = 10 \). Solving these, we find \( c = 3 \) and \( b = -5 \). Substituting back, \( a = 1 \). Thus, \( f(t) = 1 - 5t + 3t^2 \). Evaluating at \( t = -1 \):

\[
f(-1) = 1 + 5 + 3 = 9
\]
