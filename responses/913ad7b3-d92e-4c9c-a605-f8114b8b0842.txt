Okay, so I've got this question about depreciation, and I'm a bit rusty on my accounting, but let me try to work through it step by step. 

The question is about John's-Rent-A-Truck purchasing a van for $4,500. The truck is expected to last 100,000 miles and then have a trade-in value of $500. The question asks for the cost of depreciation per mile. The options are from A to J, with various amounts per mile.

Alright, first, I remember that depreciation is the process of allocating the cost of an asset over its useful life. In this case, the asset is the van. The van costs $4,500, and it's expected to last 100,000 miles. After those 100,000 miles, it can be traded in for $500. So, the key here is figuring out how much the van depreciates each mile.

I think the straight-line method is the most common way to calculate depreciation. In the straight-line method, the cost of the asset minus its salvage value is divided by the useful life in years, but here we're dealing with miles. So, I guess we'll adjust the formula to use miles instead of years.

So, the formula should be: Depreciation per mile = (Cost - Salvage Value) / Total Miles.

Let me plug in the numbers. The cost is $4,500, and the salvage value is $500. So, subtracting those gives $4,500 - $500 = $4,000. That's the total depreciation over the 100,000 miles. Now, we divide that by 100,000 miles to get the per-mile depreciation.

So, $4,000 divided by 100,000 miles. Let me calculate that: 4000 / 100000 = 0.04. Wait, that's $0.04 per mile. Hmm, looking at the options, J is $0.04 per mile. But wait, let me double-check because sometimes I might mix up the numbers.

Wait a minute, the initial cost is $4,500, salvage is $500. So, total depreciable amount is indeed $4,000. Divided by 100,000 miles, that's 4000/100000 = 0.04. So that's 4 cents per mile. So the answer should be J.

But wait, looking at the options, I see option A is 0.045, which is 4.5 cents. Did I make a mistake? Let me check again. 4,500 minus 500 is 4,000. 4,000 divided by 100,000 is 0.04. Yes, that's correct. So J is the right choice.

I think some people might confuse the total cost without considering the salvage value, but no, the salvage value definitely needs to be subtracted because that's the value left after depreciation. So yeah, J is the correct answer.

The cost of depreciation per mile is calculated by subtracting the salvage value from the initial cost and then dividing by the total miles. This gives $0.04 per mile, which corresponds to option J.

Answer: J
