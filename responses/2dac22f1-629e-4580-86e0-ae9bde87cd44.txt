Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about calculating the electrostatic force between two charges. Hmm, I think I remember something about Coulomb's Law from my classes. Let me try to work through this step by step.

Alright, the problem says there's a particle with a charge of +3.00 × 10^-6 C and another with a charge of -1.50 × 10^-6 C, and they're 12.0 cm apart. I need to find the magnitude of the force between them.

Wait, Coulomb's Law formula is F = k * |q1 * q2| / r², right? Where k is Coulomb's constant. I think k is approximately 8.988 × 10^9 N·m²/C². Oh wait, sometimes it's rounded to 9.0 × 10^9 for simplicity. I guess I'll use 9.0 × 10^9 to make the calculations easier.

So first, let me note down the given values:
- Charge q1 = +3.00 × 10^-6 C
- Charge q2 = -1.50 × 10^-6 C
- Distance r = 12.0 cm. Oh wait, Coulomb's Law uses meters, so I need to convert that to 0.12 meters.

Now, since the charges are opposite in sign, the force should be attractive. But the question asks for the magnitude, so I don't need to worry about the direction, just the size.

Let me plug the numbers into the formula.

F = k * |q1 * q2| / r²

Calculating the numerator first: q1 * q2. Let's see, 3.00e-6 * 1.50e-6. Wait, but since one is positive and the other negative, the product will be negative, but since we take the absolute value, it'll be positive anyway. So |q1*q2| = (3.00e-6)(1.50e-6) = 4.50e-12 C².

Then, r squared: (0.12 m)^2 = 0.0144 m².

Now, putting it all together: F = (9.0e9) * (4.50e-12) / 0.0144.

Let me compute each part step by step.

First, 9.0e9 multiplied by 4.50e-12. Let's calculate that: 9 * 4.5 = 40.5. Now, the exponents: 1e9 * 1e-12 = 1e-3. So 40.5e-3 is 0.0405.

So now, 0.0405 divided by 0.0144. Let me compute that division.

0.0405 / 0.0144. Hmm, both can be multiplied by 1000 to make it 40.5 /14.4. Let me see, 14.4 times 2 is 28.8, 14.4 * 2.8 = 40.32, which is close to 40.5. So approximately 2.8125.

So F ≈ 2.81 N.

Wait a minute, looking at the options, option H is 2.81 N. So that must be the correct answer.

But wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

Wait, another approach: Let me compute 9e9 * 4.5e-12 first. 9e9 is 9*10^9, 4.5e-12 is 4.5*10^-12. Multiplying together gives (9*4.5) * (10^9 * 10^-12) ) = 40.5 * 10^-3 = 0.0405.

Then, 0.0405 divided by (0.12)^2. 0.12 squared is 0.0144. So 0.0405 / 0.0144 = (40.5 / 14.4) * (10^-2 / 10^-2) ) = 40.5 /14.4 = approx 2.8125. Yep, that's correct.

So the magnitude of the force is approximately 2.81 N, which is option H.

The electrostatic force between the two charges is calculated using Coulomb's Law: 

\[
F = k \cdot \frac{|q_1 \cdot q_2|}{r^2}
\]

where \( k = 9.0 \times 10^9 \, \text{N·m}^2/\text{C}^2 \), \( q_1 = 3.00 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{C} \), \( q_2 = 1.50 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{C} \), and \( r = 0.12 \, \text{m} \). 

First, calculate the product of the charges:  
\[
|q_1 \cdot q_2| = (3.00 \times 10^{-6}) \cdot (1.50 \times 10^{-6}) = 4.50 \times 10^{-12} \, \text{C}^2
\]

Next, calculate the square of the distance:  
\[
r^2 = (0.12)^2 = 0.0144 \, \text{m}^2
\]

Substitute into the formula:  
\[
F = \frac{(9.0 \times 10^9) \cdot (4.50 \times 10^{-12})}{0.0144} = \frac{0.0405}{0.0144} \approx 2.81 \, \text{N}
\]

Thus, the magnitude of the electrostatic force is approximately **2.81 N**, corresponding to option H.
