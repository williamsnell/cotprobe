Question:

Which statement about the beak size of finches on the island of Daphne Major during prolonged drought is true?

Options:

A: Each bird's beak size increased due to the abundance of food during the drought.
B: Each bird developed a deeper, stronger beak as the drought persisted.
C: Each bird's beak became weaker and narrower as the drought persisted.
D: Each bird evolved a deeper, stronger beak as the drought persisted.
E: Each bird's survival was not influenced by the depth and strength of its beak during the drought.
F: Each bird that survived the drought produced only offspring with deeper, stronger beaks than seen in the previous generation.
G: Each bird's beak size did not change during the drought.
H: Each bird's survival was strongly influenced by the depth and strength of its beak as the drought persisted.
I: Each bird's survival was only influenced by its ability to find water during the drought, not the size of its beak.
J: Each bird that survived the drought produced offspring with the same beak size as seen in the previous generation.

Okay, so I've got this question about finches on Daphne Major during a drought. I remember learning about this in my biology class. The question is about the beak sizes of finches and which statement is true. Let me go through the options one by one.

First, the context: Daphne Major is an island where Darwin's finches were studied, particularly by Peter and Rosemary Grant. They observed how environmental changes, like droughts, affect the finches' beak sizes and their survival.

The question is about prolonged droughts. I think during droughts, the availability of food changes. The finches have to compete for seeds, and the type of seeds available might be harder to crack. So birds with certain beak sizes might have an advantage.

Looking at the options:

A: Each bird's beak size increased due to the abundance of food during the drought. Wait, no, during a drought, food probably becomes scarce, not abundant. So this might not be right.

B: Each bird developed a deeper, stronger beak as the drought persisted. Hmm, I'm not sure. It's possible that over generations, the average beak size changes, but does each bird develop a stronger beak during their lifetime? Maybe not; evolution happens over generations.

C: Each bird's beak became weaker and narrower as the drought persisted. That doesn't make sense. If a drought selects for certain traits, it's more likely that birds with stronger beaks survive, not weaker ones.

D: Each bird evolved a deeper, stronger beak as the drought persisted. Again, evolution is a process over generations, not something that happens to each individual bird during its lifetime. So this might not be correct because it's talking about each bird evolving, which isn't how it works.

E: Each bird's survival was not influenced by the depth and strength of its beak during the drought. That seems incorrect because the Grants' work showed that beak size does affect survivalâ€”birds with the right beak size for the available seeds are more likely to survive.

F: Each bird that survived the drought produced only offspring with deeper, stronger beaks than seen in the previous generation. This sounds a bit off. It's more about the average change in the population, not that every surviving bird's offspring have deeper beaks. Plus, it's about the next generation, not just the survivors.

G: Each bird's beak size did not change during the drought. I don't think this is right because the Grants observed changes in beak size over time due to selection pressures.

H: Each bird's survival was strongly influenced by the depth and strength of its beak as the drought persisted. This aligns with what I remember. During droughts, the type of seeds available becomes harder, so birds with stronger beaks can crack them and are more likely to survive.

I: Each bird's survival was only influenced by its ability to find water, not the size of its beak. No, because the beak size relates to accessing food, which is crucial during droughts when water might be available but food is limited.

J: Each bird that survived the drought produced offspring with the same beak size as seen in the previous generation. That doesn't sound right because the Grants' work showed that the average beak size in the next generation changes based on selection.

So, putting it together. The correct statement should be about the influence of beak size on survival. Option H says that each bird's survival was strongly influenced by the depth and strength of its beak during the drought, which matches what I know about the Grants' findings.

The correct answer is H: Each bird's survival was strongly influenced by the depth and strength of its beak as the drought persisted.
