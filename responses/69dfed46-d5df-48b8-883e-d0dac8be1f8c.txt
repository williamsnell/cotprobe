Okay, so I've got this problem here about amplitude modulation with noise, and I need to find the power dissipated by the modulated signal m(t). Hmm, let's start breaking this down.

The problem says that the carrier is m(t) = n(t) multiplied by cos(ω₀t + θ), where θ is a random variable with a probability density function f(θ) = 1/(2π) for -π ≤ θ ≤ π, and zero elsewhere. Also, E[n²(t)] is given as σ², and θ and n(t) are independent. 

Wait, so m(t) is the product of a noise signal n(t) and a cosine function whose phase θ is random but uniformly distributed. Since θ and n(t) are independent, their statistical properties don't influence each other. That probably simplifies things because I can treat them separately when calculating expectations.

Power dissipated by m(t) would be the average power, right? So I need to find E[m²(t)] because power is the expectation of the square of the signal. So let's write that out:

E[m²(t)] = E[ (n(t) cos(ω₀t + θ))² ]

Expanding the square, that becomes E[ n²(t) cos²(ω₀t + θ) ]

Since n(t) and θ are independent, their expectations can be treated separately. Also, cos²(ω₀t + θ) can be simplified using a trigonometric identity: cos²(x) = (1 + cos(2x))/2.

So substituting that in, the expression becomes:

E[ n²(t) * (1 + cos(2(ω₀t + θ)))/2 ]

Which simplifies to (1/2) E[n²(t)] + (1/2) E[ n²(t) cos(2(ω₀t + θ)) ].

Wait, but I'm taking the expectation over time and θ. Since θ is a random variable and n(t) is a noise process, which I assume is zero-mean and stationary. Also, θ is uniformly distributed around the circle, so averaging over θ might zero out some terms.

Let's split the expectation into two parts:

First term: (1/2) E[n²(t)] → since E[n²(t)] is σ², this becomes (1/2) σ².

Second term: (1/2) E[ n²(t) cos(2ω₀t + 2θ) ]

Now, since n(t) and θ are independent, can I separate their expectations? Wait, but cos(2ω₀t + 2θ) is a function of both t and θ. However, n(t) is a function of time, and θ is a random variable independent of n(t). But t is a variable, not a random variable, so I'm not sure if I can directly separate them. Maybe I need to consider the expectation over θ for each fixed t.

Wait, perhaps I should think of E[ cos(2ω₀t + 2θ) ] over θ. So for a fixed t, cos(2ω₀t + 2θ) is a function of θ, which is uniformly distributed over [-π, π]. Let me compute the expectation of cos(2θ) because 2ω₀t is a function of t but not of θ, so I can factor that out.

Wait, cos(a + b) = cos a cos b - sin a sin b. But in our case, it's cos(2ω₀t + 2θ) = cos(2ω₀t) cos(2θ) - sin(2ω₀t) sin(2θ).

Now, E[ cos(2ω₀t + 2θ) ] over θ would be E[ cos(2θ) ] cos(2ω₀t) - E[ sin(2θ) ] sin(2ω₀t).

But what's E[cos(2θ)] when θ is uniformly distributed over [-π, π]? Since the distribution is symmetric, the expectation of cos(2θ) over this interval is zero because cos is an even function, but when you integrate over a full period, it averages to zero. Similarly, E[sin(2θ)] is zero because sine is an odd function and the integral over symmetric limits is zero.

So E[ cos(2θ) ] = 0 and E[ sin(2θ) ] = 0. Therefore, E[ cos(2ω₀t + 2θ) ] = 0 for any t.

Wait, but then the second term becomes (1/2) E[n²(t)] * E[ cos(2ω₀t + 2θ) ] = (1/2) σ² * 0 = 0. Because n(t) and θ are independent, so E[ n²(t) cos(2ω₀t + 2θ) ] = E[n²(t)] * E[ cos(2ω₀t + 2θ) ] = σ² * 0 = 0.

So the entire expectation E[m²(t)] reduces to (1/2) σ² + 0 = (1/2) σ².

Wait, but looking at the options, I see option I is (1/2)σ². So the answer should be I.

Wait, but let me double-check. Did I make any mistake in the steps?

Hmm, another approach: since m(t) = n(t) cos(θ + ω₀t), and θ is random, perhaps we can model m(t) as n(t) multiplied by a random variable that's the cosine of a uniformly distributed angle θ. Since the carrier's phase is random, maybe the average of cos² is 1/2. Because the average value of cos² over a full cycle is 1/2, regardless of the phase.

Wait, but in this case, θ is the phase, so m(t) is n(t) cos(θ + ω₀t). But for each t, the average over θ would make cos²(θ + ω₀t) average to 1/2, because the average of cos²(x) over x from 0 to 2π is 1/2.

Wait, but in our case, θ is a random variable, so perhaps the average over θ would cause the same effect. So E[ cos²(θ + ω₀t) ] = 1/2, because the average of cos² is 1/2.

If that's the case, then m²(t) would be n²(t) * (1/2), so the expectation E[m²(t)] = E[n²(t)] * (1/2) = σ² * (1/2) = (1/2)σ².

So that confirms the previous result. Therefore, the power is (1/2)σ², which is option I.

The power dissipated by the signal \( m(t) = n(t) \cos(\omega_0 t + \theta) \) is determined by calculating \( E[m^2(t)] \). Expanding \( m^2(t) \) gives \( E[n^2(t) \cos^2(\omega_0 t + \theta)] \). Using the trigonometric identity \( \cos^2(x) = \frac{1 + \cos(2x)}{2} \), this becomes \( \frac{1}{2} E[n^2(t)] + \frac{1}{2} E[n^2(t) \cos(2\omega_0 t + 2\theta)] \). 

Since \( n(t) \) and \( \theta \) are independent, the second term involves \( E[\cos(2\omega_0 t + 2\theta)] \), which averages to zero due to the uniform distribution of \( \theta \). Thus, \( E[m^2(t)] = \frac{1}{2} E[n^2(t)] = \frac{1}{2} \sigma^2 \). Therefore, the power dissipated is \( \frac{1}{2} \sigma^2 \), corresponding to option I.
