Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the answer to this question about Louis and his image restoration strategy. Let me break it down step by step.

The question says that Louis owns a chemical company. He's been cutting costs by irresponsibly disposing of chemical waste, which has contaminated the community's water. That's really bad, obviously. But here's the kicker: Louis knew that the company was cutting costs on waste disposal, but publicly he claims he had no knowledge of these irresponsible practices. Instead, he blames it on the company's general manager and fires him. So, what's the image restoration strategy here?

I remember that image restoration strategies are techniques individuals or companies use after a crisis to try to maintain or regain public favor. There are a few common ones: denial, minimization, corrective action, etc.

Let me look at the options one by one.

Option A: Mortification. I think mortification is when someone admits fault and expresses deep regret. That doesn't seem to fit here because Louis isn't admitting anything; he's shifting blame.

Option B: Minimization. Minimization is when the issue is downplayed, making it seem less serious. But Louis isn't saying the problem isn't bad; he's just not taking responsibility for it.

Option C: Reducing the offensiveness. This might involve trying to make the issue seem less severe or more justified. Not sure if that's what's happening here.

Option D: Good intentions. Sometimes people claim they had good intentions but things went wrong. Louis isn't doing that; he's just denying his own knowledge.

Option E: Attacking the accuser. That's when the person指责the ones who are pointing fingers. Louis isn't attacking anyone; he's just blaming the general manager.

Option F: Corrective action. This is about taking steps to fix the problem. Louis fired the GM, which could be seen as corrective, but since he's also denying his own involvement, maybe this isn't the main strategy.

Option G: Compensation. Offering some form of payment or reparations. The question doesn't mention any compensation, so probably not this.

Option H: Bolstering. This involves strengthening one's image by highlighting positive attributes. Louis isn't doing that here; he's more about deflecting blame.

Option I: Denial. This is when someone denies any wrongdoing. The question says Louis publicly claims he had no knowledge, which sounds like a denial.

Option J: Evasion of responsibility. This is similar to denial but might involve shifting blame. Louis is blaming the GM and firing him, which is evading his own responsibility.

Wait, so both I and J seem possible. Denial is about saying he didn't know, while evasion is about shifting blame and not taking responsibility. The question says he not only denies knowledge but also blames the GM. So he's both denying and evading responsibility.

But in image restoration terms, the main tactic here is denial because he's saying he didn't know, which is a direct denial of involvement. However, by blaming the GM and taking action (firing him), he's also evading responsibility. So which one is the primary strategy?

I think the primary strategy here is denial because he's directly claiming he had no knowledge. Evasion of responsibility might be a part of it, but the main tactic is denial.

The image restoration strategy Louis is using is **denial** because he publicly claims he had no knowledge of the irresponsible practices, directly denying any involvement or oversight. 

Answer: I
