Okay, so I have this question about inventory turnover for Baxter Co, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by recalling what inventory turnover means. From what I remember, inventory turnover is a ratio that measures how many times a company's inventory is sold and replaced over a specific period, usually a year. It's an important metric because it tells you how efficiently a company is managing its inventory.

The formula for inventory turnover, I think, is the cost of goods sold (COGS) divided by the average inventory. The question gives me the beginning and ending inventory, so I can calculate the average inventory by adding the two and dividing by 2.

Let's look at the numbers provided. The beginning inventory is $200,000, and the ending inventory is $300,000. So the average inventory would be (200,000 + 300,000) / 2. Let me compute that: 200k plus 300k is 500k, divided by 2 gives 250k. So the average inventory is $250,000.

Next, the cost of goods sold (COGS) during the year is $500,000. Now, applying the formula, inventory turnover = COGS / Average Inventory. Plugging in the numbers: 500,000 divided by 250,000. Let me do that division: 500k / 250k equals 2. So the inventory turnover is 2.

Looking at the options, I see option I is 2. So that should be the correct answer. But wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't mix up any numbers. The beginning is 200k, end is 300k, average is 250k, COGS is 500k. 500 divided by 250 is indeed 2. Yep, that makes sense. So I'm confident the answer is I.

The inventory turnover is calculated by dividing the cost of goods sold by the average inventory. The average inventory is ($200,000 + $300,000) / 2 = $250,000. The cost of goods sold is $500,000. Therefore, the inventory turnover is $500,000 / $250,000 = 2.

Answer: I
