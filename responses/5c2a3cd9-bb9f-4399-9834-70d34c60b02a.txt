Question:

A toy collector had purchased 10 antique toys over the last several years and had had them restored by an expert in toy restoration. On June 1, the collector sent the 11th antique toy to the expert with a signed note that read: "Here is another toy for you to restore. As with all prior jobs, I will pay $500 for the work, but no more." On June 4, after receipt of the collector's June 1 note and the toy, the expert began restoring the toy. On June 6, the collector unexpectedly died. On June 7, unaware of the collector's death, the expert sent the collector a note that stated that the restoration work had begun on June 4. The following day, the expert learned of the collector's death. Does a contract exist that binds the expert and the collector's estate?

Options:

A: Yes, because the expert sent the June 7 note before learning of the collector's death.
B: Yes, because the previous successful contracts set a precedent for this one.
C: No, because the collector died before the expert sent the June 7 note.
D: No, because the contract was not formally written and signed.
E: No, because the expert was not aware of the collector's death before starting the restoration.
F: No, because the offer lapsed when the collector died.
G: Yes, because the expert had already accepted the work and payment terms.
H: Yes, because the offer was accepted before the collector's death.
I: No, because the collector's estate did not confirm the contract.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether a contract exists between the expert and the collector's estate after the collector died. Let me break down the situation step by step.

First, the collector sent an 11th toy to the expert on June 1 with a note saying they'll pay $500, just like before. So the collector is making an offer to the expert to restore this toy for $500. Then, on June 4, the expert starts restoring the toy after receiving the note and the toy. 

On June 7, the expert sends a note to the collector saying the work has begun. But before sending this note, the expert didn't know the collector had died on June 6. The next day, June 8, the expert learns of the collector's death.

Now, the question is whether a contract exists that binds the expert and the collector's estate.

I remember that for a contract to be valid, there needs to be an offer, acceptance, and consideration. Also, the offer must be accepted before it lapses.

In this case, the collector made an offer on June 1. The expert started working on June 4, which might be seen as acceptance because they began performing the work. So, by starting the restoration, the expert accepted the offer. The consideration here is the $500 payment from the collector.

But the collector died on June 6. Now, does the death of one party before acceptance affect the contract? Well, in contract law, generally, if the offeror dies before the offer is accepted, the offer doesn't automatically lapse unless it's a special case. But in this scenario, the expert started working on June 4, which is before the collector's death on June 6. So the expert accepted the offer before the collector died. 

Wait, but the expert sent a note on June 7, after the death, but before knowing about it. Does that affect anything? I think once the expert accepted the offer by starting work, the contract is formed. The fact that the expert later sent a note after the collector's death doesn't change the fact that the contract was already accepted before the death.

So the contract exists because the expert accepted the offer before the collector died. The death after acceptance doesn't invalidate the contract. The estate would be bound because the contract was formed before the collector's death.

Looking at the options:

A: Says yes because the expert sent the note before learning of the death. That might not be the main reason; the key is that acceptance happened before death.

B: Previous contracts set a precedent. That's about past dealings, but the main issue is whether this specific offer was accepted.

C: No because the collector died before the expert sent the note. But the expert accepted by starting work on June 4, before the death.

D: No because not written. But contracts can be oral if they meet the requirements, and this seems to fit.

E: No because expert didn't know about death before starting. But the expert didn't need to know; the timing is what matters.

F: No because offer lapsed when collector died. But offers don't lapse upon death unless it's a special case, and here the expert accepted before death.

G: Yes because expert accepted work and payment. This seems correct because acceptance by starting work is key.

H: Yes because offer was accepted before death. That's accurate because the expert accepted on June 4, before June 6.

I: No because estate didn't confirm. But the estate isn't a party to the contract yet; the contract was with the collector, who is now deceased, so the estate would step in.

So the correct answer is H: Yes, because the offer was accepted before the collector's death.

The expert accepted the collector's offer by starting the restoration on June 4, which is before the collector's death on June 6. Therefore, the contract was formed and binds the expert and the collector's estate.

Answer: H
