Question:

In Python 3, which of the following function convert a string to an int in python?

Options:

A: short(x)
B: float(x)
C: integer(x [,base])
D: double(x)
E: int(x [,base])
F: long(x [,base] )
G: num(x)
H: str(x)
I: char(x)
J: digit(x [,base])

Answer:

Okay, so I've got this Python question here about converting a string to an integer. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit new to Python, so I might make some mistakes, but I'll work through them.

The question is asking which function in Python 3 converts a string to an int. The options are A through J, each with a different function name. I remember that Python has built-in functions for type conversions, so I'm thinking about those.

First, I'll list out what I know. In Python, to convert a string to an integer, the common function I've heard about is int(). So I'm thinking option E is int(x [,base]). That sounds right because I've used int("123") before and it worked, giving me 123 as an integer.

Let me look at the other options to make sure I'm not missing something. Option A is short(x), which I don't think is a real function. Short doesn't ring a bell. Option B is float(x), which converts to a float, not an int. So that's not it.

Option C is integer(x [,base]). Wait, does Python have a function called integer()? I'm pretty sure it's int(), not integer(). So C is probably incorrect. D is double(x), which is for floats in some other languages, but in Python, it's float(), so D is out.

E is int(x [,base]), which I'm confident is correct. F is long(x), but I think in Python 3, the long type was merged into int, so long() isn't a separate function anymore. So F is wrong.

G is num(x), which I don't think exists. Maybe it's a typo for int() or something else. H is str(x), which converts to a string, not an integer. I is char(x), which would give a character, but that's not relevant here. J is digit(x), but that's a string method checking if all characters are digits, not a conversion function.

So, putting it all together, the correct function is E: int(x [,base]). That's the one that takes a string and converts it to an integer, optionally using a different base if needed.

The correct function to convert a string to an integer in Python 3 is `int()`, which is option E.

Answer: E
