Okay, so I've got this question about the Hopewell culture. I'm a bit rusty on my history, but I'll try to think it through. The question is asking which element Hopewell culture lacked, except for one. The options are A through D: formal government, monumental earthworks, urban centers, and a permanent military.

First, I remember that the Hopewell were part of the mound builder cultures in North America, known for their earthworks. They were around from about 200 BCE to 500 CE, I think. They were complex societies but not states. So, they didn't have a formal government like a state would, but they must have had some sort of organization.

Monumental earthworks—those are the big mounds they built, right? Like the ones in Ohio. So that's definitely something they had, so B is not the exception. They were into building these earthworks for ceremonial or social purposes, so B is present, meaning the question is looking for something they lacked except one.

Urban centers—states usually have cities with a lot of people living together. The Hopewell didn't have large urban areas. Their settlements were more spread out, with people living in smaller villages. So urban centers might be something they lacked, meaning C could be the correct answer.

Formal government—states have governments with laws and officials, but the Hopewell were more likely organized in a different way, maybe through religious or ceremonial leaders. They might not have had a formal government structure like a state does. So A is something they lacked, so A could be an option.

Permanent military—states usually maintain standing armies. The Hopewell probably didn't have a permanent military force. They might have had warriors when needed, but not a standing army. So D is something they lacked.

Wait, the question says they lacked all of the following except one. So the correct answer is the one they did have. Let's see: B is something they had (earthworks), so the other options (A, C, D) are things they lacked. So the question is which one they did have, except for the others.

Wait, no. The question is phrased as "lacked all of the following elements EXCEPT." So the correct answer is the element that they did have. So among the options, which one did they have?

They had monumental earthworks (B), so B is the one they had. So the answer is B, because the other options are things they lacked.

Wait, but I thought the question was which they lacked except one. So the correct answer is the one they had. So the exception is B, so the answer is B. But let me double-check.

Wait, the Hopewell didn't have formal governments (A), urban centers (C), or permanent military (D). They did have monumental earthworks (B). So the question is which they lacked except one, so the exception is B. So the answer is B.

But wait, the options are A through D as elements they lacked, except one. So the correct choice is the one they did have, which is B. So the answer is B.

The Hopewell culture lacked formal government, urban centers, and a permanent military but possessed monumental earthworks. Therefore, the answer is:

B
