Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about a theory related to how people make choices based on values and beliefs. Let me think through it step by step.

The question asks which theory is built around the principle that people make choices based on values and beliefs. The options are A to J, each with different theories.

First, I need to remember what each of these theories is about. Let me try to recall:

- **Social Learning Theory**: This one says that people learn through observing others' behaviors and then doing the same. It's about observing and imitating what others do, leading to behavior changes.

- **Contingency Theory**: Hmm, not sure about this one. I think it's related to decision-making, maybe about how people respond to threats or rewards. It's more about the balance between fear and gain.

- **Operant Conditioning**: This is about conditioning through rewards and punishments, leading to a behavior that's rewarded repeatedly. So it's about how behavior is modified by outcomes.

- **Evolutionary Theory**: This is more about explaining how species got here using natural selection and the role of genes. Not directly about choice behavior.

- **Classical Theory**: I'm not certain. The term 'classical' sometimes refers to the idea that people make decisions based on an expectation of what they'll get, like the gambler's fallacy or the sunk cost fallacy.

- **Expectancy Theory**: This one rings a bell. It's about how people evaluate their behavior based on the expectation that a particular outcome will happen. So they set a standard of what they expect, and if they meet that, they do the behavior.

- **Psychoanalytic Theory**: This is more about the unconscious mind and unconscious processing of experience. It's about personification of events and how thoughts and emotions influence behavior.

- **Instrumental Theory**: I'm not sure. Maybe this is about the idea that people act in ways that maximize their utility or value, so they choose the action that gives them the most benefit.

- **Cognitive Dissonance Theory**: This is about the mental discomfort people feel when they're faced with conflicting desires or expectations. It's more about how people adjust their behavior to minimize this discomfort.

- **Humanistic Theory**: This theory emphasizes the role of the individual's self and inner world in their behavior. It suggests that people have a fundamental drive to understand themselves and their environment.

Now, the question is about the theory built around choices based on values and beliefs. So, I'm looking for a theory that emphasizes the role of values and beliefs in decision-making.

Looking at the options, Contingency Theory is about how people respond to threats and rewards, which relates to their choices being shaped by their perceptions of potential outcomes. So maybe that's not it.

Wait, the question is about choices based on values and beliefs. So which theory directly incorporates these elements?

I think the key here is that the theory is about the principles of choice based on values. So perhaps it's the one that talks about the role of values in guiding behavior.

Wait, let me think again. The theories that deal with decision-making and behavior are either operant conditioning, expectancy, cognitive dissonance, etc.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think of each:

- **Contingency Theory** is about how people react to outcomes. For example, if someone feels threatened, they might fear getting worse, which leads them to avoid. So it's about how people respond to positive or negative outcomes, which is influenced by their values.

- **Expectancy Theory** is about how people evaluate their behavior based on the expectation of a positive outcome. So it's about setting a standard of what they expect, which is a value-based expectation.

So the question is about the principle that people make choices based on values and beliefs. Both Expectancy and Contingency theories are about how people make decisions, but which one is built around the principle.

Wait, another angle: the term "principle" in the question is about the underlying idea. Which theories are about principles that guide choices.

Wait, the question is a bit unclear. Alternatively, maybe it's about which theory is built around the idea that choices are made based on certain values.

Wait, I think I remember that Expectancy Theory is about setting criteria for behavior based on expected outcomes, so it's about the principles of choice being based on values.

Alternatively, the term "contingency" in the question might refer to the contingency of outcomes, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is the Contingency Theory, but I'm not entirely certain.

Wait, the options are A to J, with B being Contingency, which I think refers to the idea that people respond to possible outcomes, thus influenced by their values.

Wait, but I also recall that the Expectancy Theory is about setting standards, which are values.

I think the correct answer is B: Contingency.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the question says, "built around the principle that people make choices regarding how to behave based on values and beliefs." So the theory is about the principle that people make choices based on these values.

Wait, perhaps the theory is the Expectancy Theory, which states that people evaluate their behavior based on the expectation of a positive outcome (i.e., a value-based expectation).

Alternatively, another angle: the term "principle" here refers to a fundamental idea or rule.

Wait, thinking back, the term 'contingency' is often associated with the idea of what people think might happen, which ties into the idea of choice based on possible outcomes, which is a value-based decision-making principle.

Hmm, but I'm a bit stuck here. Alternatively, the term "principle" in the question is about the underlying idea that choice is made based on values.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is B: Contingency.

Wait, no, I'm now getting confused. Alternatively, the term 'contingency' in the options refers to the idea that people think about possible outcomes, so that's a principle.

Wait, let me think about each option again:

A: Social Learning - about observing others and imitating their behavior.

B: Contingency - about what people think might happen, so it's the basis for choice.

C: Operant Conditioning - about conditioning through rewards and punishments, leading to a behavior.

D: Evolutionary - about how species evolved through natural selection.

E: Classical - about the gambler's fallacy or the sunk cost fallacy.

F: Expectancy - about setting standards based on expected outcomes.

G: Psychoanalytic - about personification of experiences and self.

H: Instrumental - about maximizing utility.

I: Cognitive Dissonance - about minimizing discomfort by adjusting behavior.

J: Humanistic - about the individual's role in behavior.

The question is about the theory that builds around the principle that choices are made based on values and beliefs. So which theory is about the principles of choice, like how people evaluate their behavior based on values.

The term "principle" in the question refers to the underlying idea that choice is based on values, which is the Expectancy Theory, where people evaluate their behavior based on the expectation of a positive outcome (i.e., a value-based expectation). So the correct answer would be F: Expectancy.

Wait, but earlier I thought B: Contingency might be the answer. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: the term "principle" in the question refers to a fundamental rule or idea. The question is about the theory that's built around the principle. So the theory itself is the principle.

Wait, I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to think of each theory.

Contingency Theory: It's about how people respond to possible outcomes, so it's about the principle of choice being based on what they expect to happen.

Expectancy Theory: It's about setting a standard of behavior based on what they expect to happen.

So both are principles about choice. But the question is about which theory is built around that principle.

Wait, the question is phrased as: 'What theory is built around the principle that people make choices based on values and beliefs?'

So the theory is the one that is built to explain that principle.

Thus, which theory is the one that explains how people make choices based on values and beliefs.

So the answer would be the one that deals with choice principles, which is Expectancy Theory (F).

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is B: Contingency.

Wait, another thought: the term "principle" in the question refers to the underlying idea behind the theory. So the theory is the one that defines that principle.

If the principle is the idea that people make choices based on values and beliefs, then perhaps it's the Contingency Theory, because it deals with how people respond to possible outcomes (contingencies), which are influenced by their values.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should recall that the term 'contingency' in the options refers to the idea that people think about what outcomes are possible, which is a principle.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is B: Contingency.

Wait, no, I think the correct answer is F: Expectancy because it's about how people set their expectations based on what they think might happen, which is a value-based expectation.

Wait, another approach: the theory built around the principle that people make choices based on values and beliefs. So, the theory itself is about this principle.

The options that are about choice and principles are:

Contingency (B): about possible outcomes.

Expectancy (F): about setting standards based on expected outcomes.

So, the answer is F: Expectancy.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is B: Contingency.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think: the term 'principle' in the question refers to the idea of choice based on values and beliefs. So the theory is the one that explains this principle.

The Contingency Theory is about how people respond to possible outcomes, which is a principle. So the theory is the one that explains that.

So the correct answer is B: Contingency.

Wait, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, the correct answer is F: Expectancy.

Wait, I think I remember that the Expectancy Theory is about what people set as their criteria, which is based on their values. So the correct answer is F.

But wait, another perspective: the term 'principle' in the question refers to the underlying idea that people make choices based on values. So the theory is the one that explains that.

The Contingency Theory is about what people think might happen, which is a value-based response.

The Expectancy Theory is about setting standards based on what they think might happen, which is also a value-based approach.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck. But I think the correct answer is B: Contingency.

Wait, no, perhaps the correct answer is F: Expectancy.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think of the theories again.

The Contingency Theory is about how people respond to possible outcomes, which is about evaluating possible results based on values.

The Expectancy Theory is about setting a standard of what you expect to happen.

So both theories are about how people make choices, but which one is built around the principle.

The question is about the theory that's built around the principle that people make choices based on values and beliefs.

So the correct answer is F: Expectancy.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is C: Operant Conditioning, but that's about conditioning through rewards and punishments, which is a different area.

Alternatively, I think I'm overcomplicating. Let me think: the term 'principle' in the question refers to the idea of choice based on values and beliefs, which is the concept of the principle of rational choice.

The theory that includes this is the Expectancy Theory, which is about setting a standard of behavior based on expected outcomes.

So the correct answer is F: Expectancy.
</think>

The question asks which theory is built around the principle that people make choices based on values and beliefs. To determine the correct answer, each option must be analyzed in the context of this principle.

- **Social Learning Theory**: Focuses on observing and imitating others' behaviors, not directly on values or beliefs influencing choice.
- **Contingency Theory**: Deals with how people respond to possible outcomes, influenced by their values and beliefs, making it relevant.
- **Operant Conditioning**: Introduces the idea of conditioning through rewards and punishments, which is a separate area.
- **Evolutionary Theory**: Examines survival through natural selection, unrelated to choice behavior.
- **Classical Theory**: Pertains to decision-making based on fear and gain, not values or beliefs.
- **Expectancy Theory**: Validates that people evaluate their behavior based on expected outcomes, which aligns with values and beliefs.
- **Psychoanalytic Theory**: Focuses on unconscious processes, not directly on choice principles.
- **Instrumental Theory**: Relates to maximizing utility, not values or beliefs.
- **Cognitive Dissonance Theory**: Minimizes discomfort by adjusting behavior, not choice principles.
- **Humanistic Theory**: Emphasizes individual self and environment in behavior, not choice principles.
- **Cognitive Dissonance**: Related to minimizing discomfort, not choice principles.

The principle of choice based on values and beliefs is best captured by **Expectancy Theory**, which explains how people set standards for behavior based on expected outcomes. While **Contingency Theory** is also relevant, **Expectancy Theory** directly addresses the idea of choice influenced by values.
