Okay, I need to figure out which speech the given statement aligns with. Let me read the statement carefully. It's from Woodrow Wilson in 1914, talking about neutrality during a contest, probably WWI. He's stating that the U.S. must remain neutral, not interfere, and not allow their waters to be used for war purposes.

Now, looking at the options:

A: Washington's Farewell Address. He warned against foreign entanglements and partisanship. That's about neutrality and avoiding war, so this could be a match.

B: Eisenhower's Military-Industrial Complex. He talked about the dangers of the military-industrial complex, which is more about domestic policy and cautioning against excessive military influence. Doesn't seem to fit the neutrality theme.

C: FDR's Day of Infamy. That's about Pearl Harbor and entering WWII. Opposite stance since FDR was declaring war, not neutrality.

D: MLK's I Have a Dream. Civil rights speech, not related to neutrality in international affairs.

E: Obama's A More Perfect Union. His speech about race relations and unity, not about neutrality in wars.

F: Nixon's Checkers Speech. About his administration and the Checkers scandal. Not related to neutrality.

G: Reagan's Berlin Wall Speech. About opposing communism and the wall, not about neutrality.

H: JFK's Inaugural Address. He talked about bearing any burden and the New Frontier, emphasizing commitment rather than neutrality. He said the U.S. would support free nations, which is the opposite of neutrality.

I: Lincoln's Gettysburg Address. About the Civil War, focusing on the nation's unity and freedom, not about neutrality.

J: Bush's Thousand Points of Light. About volunteerism and community service, unrelated to neutrality.

So, comparing the statement to the options, the closest match is A: Washington's Farewell Address, which emphasizes avoiding foreign entanglements and maintaining neutrality. Both are about the U.S. staying neutral in conflicts. The others either talk about entering war, military issues, or unrelated domestic topics.

The statement reflects a neutral stance, aligning with Washington's Farewell Address, which also emphasizes avoiding foreign entanglements. 

Answer: A
