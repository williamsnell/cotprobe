Okay, so I've got this problem about finding the latent heat of vaporization of liquid carbon tetrachloride at its boiling point of 350 K. The vapor pressure is given by this equation: gP = -2400/T - 5.30 log T + 23.60, and P is in mmHg. I remember that the latent heat of vaporization is related to the change in Gibbs free energy, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact steps. Let me think.

First, I think the latent heat of vaporization, L, is the amount of energy required to turn a mole of liquid into vapor at its boiling point. Since it's at the boiling point, the process is reversible, so the change in Gibbs free energy (ΔG) should be zero. The formula I recall is ΔG = ΔH - TΔS = 0, so ΔH = TΔS. But wait, ΔH here is the enthalpy change, which at constant pressure is equal to the heat absorbed, so that's the latent heat.

Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing terms. The latent heat of vaporization, L, is the same as the enthalpy change of vaporization, ΔH_vap. So, ΔH_vap = TΔS. But I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Alternatively, I think Clapeyron equation relates the change in vapor pressure with temperature to the latent heat. The Clapeyron equation is dP/dT = (L)/(TΔV). Since the problem states to assume ideal gas behavior, maybe I can use that.

Wait, but I'm given the vapor pressure as a function of temperature. So maybe I should find the slope of the vapor pressure vs. 1/T at the boiling point. The Clapeyron equation can be rewritten in terms of the enthalpy of vaporization. The equation is (dP/dT) = (L)/(ΔV), but I think ΔV is approximately equal to nRT/P for an ideal gas. Wait, but perhaps it's easier to use the form that involves the derivative of P with respect to T.

Alternatively, another approach I remember is that the latent heat can be found using the change in vapor pressure with temperature. The formula is L = (ΔP * R * T^2) / (Δ(1/P) * ΔT), but I'm not sure if I'm recalling that correctly. Maybe a better approach is to use the Clausius-Clapeyron equation, which relates the change in vapor pressure to the latent heat.

The Clausius-Clapeyron equation in differential form is dP/dT = (L)/(TΔV). For an ideal gas, ΔV ≈ nRT/P, so substituting that in, we get dP/dT ≈ (L)/(T*(nRT/P)). Hmm, but maybe that's getting too complicated. Alternatively, if we can take the derivative of P with respect to T at the boiling point, we can find dP/dT and then solve for L.

Wait, the given equation is P as a function of T. So let me write it more clearly. The equation is P(T) = (-2400)/T + (-5.30) log T + 23.60, where P is in mmHg. So to find dP/dT, I can differentiate P with respect to T.

Differentiating term by term:

dP/dT = d/dT [ (-2400)/T ] + d/dT [ (-5.30) log T ] + d/dT [23.60 ]

The derivative of (-2400)/T is 2400/(T^2), because d/dT (1/T) = -1/T², so the negative times negative gives positive.

The derivative of (-5.30) log T is (-5.30)*(1/T), since d/dT (log T) is 1/T.

The derivative of a constant (23.60) is zero.

So putting it together: dP/dT = (2400)/(T²) - (5.30)/T.

At the boiling point T = 350 K, let's plug that in.

Calculate each term:

2400/(350)^2 = 2400 / 122500 ≈ 0.01959 mmHg/K.

5.30 / 350 ≈ 0.01514 mmHg/K.

So dP/dT ≈ 0.01959 - 0.01514 ≈ 0.00445 mmHg/K.

Wait, that seems small. Let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, 350 squared is 122500. So 2400/122500 = 2400 ÷ 122500. Let me compute that: 2400 ÷ 122500. Well, 2400 ÷ 122500 = 0.01959 approximately.

Then 5.30 / 350 = 0.01514.

So 0.01959 - 0.01514 = 0.00445 mmHg/K.

Now, according to the Clausius-Clapeyron equation, dP/dT = L/(TΔV), and since we're assuming ideal gas behavior, ΔV is the volume of the gas, which is nRT/P. But wait, for 1 mole, n=1, so ΔV ≈ RT/P. But in the equation, L is per mole, so perhaps I can write ΔV as RT/P, where P is the vapor pressure at the boiling point.

Wait, but I need to find L. So rearranging the equation:

L = T * ΔV * (dP/dT).

But wait, wait. Let me think again. The Clausius-Clapeyron equation is dP/dT = (L)/(TΔV). So L = TΔV * (dP/dT).

But ΔV is the volume change upon vaporization, which is V_gas - V_liquid. Since the liquid volume is negligible compared to the gas, ΔV ≈ V_gas = nRT/P. For 1 mole, n=1, so V = RT/P.

So substituting ΔV ≈ RT/P, we get:

L = T * (RT/P) * (dP/dT) = R T^2 (dP/dT) / P.

So L = (R T^2 / P) * (dP/dT).

Now, let's plug in the numbers. R is the gas constant. Let me check the units. Since P is in mmHg, and we need L in cal/mol, perhaps we should convert R into appropriate units.

Wait, R is 8.314 J/(mol·K). But since we need cal, perhaps better to use R = 8.314 J/(mol·K) = 1.987 cal/(mol·K).

Wait, 1 cal = 4.184 J, so R in cal/(mol·K) is 8.314 / 4.184 ≈ 1.987 cal/(mol·K).

So R ≈ 2 cal/(mol·K) for approximation, but perhaps I should use the exact value later.

Now, I need to compute P at T=350 K. Let's plug T=350 into the given equation for P.

P(T) = (-2400)/350 + (-5.30) * log(350) + 23.60.

Compute each term:

-2400 / 350 ≈ -6.857 mmHg.

log(350): Well, log(100)=2, log(1000)=3, so log(350) is between 2.5 and 2.6. Let's compute it more accurately.

Using a calculator, log(350) ≈ 2.5441.

So (-5.30) * 2.5441 ≈ -13.483 mmHg.

Adding up the three terms: -6.857 -13.483 +23.60 = (-20.34) +23.60 = 3.26 mmHg.

So P ≈ 3.26 mmHg at 350 K.

Wait, that seems really low. I thought carbon tetrachloride's boiling point is around 350 K, but the vapor pressure at that point is only 3.26 mmHg? Wait, but I remember that the normal boiling point is around 350 K and the vapor pressure is lower than that at higher temperatures. Wait, no, perhaps I'm mixing things up. Let me just proceed with the numbers.

Now, compute L = R * T^2 * (dP/dT) / P.

Substituting the values:

R ≈ 1.987 cal/(mol·K)

T = 350 K

dP/dT ≈ 0.00445 mmHg/K

P = 3.26 mmHg.

So L = (1.987) * (350)^2 * (0.00445) / 3.26.

Compute step by step.

First, 350^2 = 122500.

Multiply by 0.00445: 122500 * 0.00445 ≈ 545.125.

Then, 545.125 / 3.26 ≈ 167.34.

Now multiply by R: 1.987 * 167.34 ≈ 333.3 cal/mol.

Wait, that's way lower than the options given. The options start at 5,000 cal/mol. Did I make a mistake somewhere?

Let me check the differentiation step. The original equation is P(T) = (-2400)/T -5.30 log T +23.60.

dP/dT = 2400/T² -5.30/T. At T=350, that's 2400/(350^2) -5.30/350.

2400/(122500) = 0.01959 mmHg/K.

5.30/350 ≈ 0.01514 mmHg/K.

So 0.01959 -0.01514 = 0.00445 mmHg/K. That seems correct.

Wait, but perhaps I need to consider that the equation is given as gP = ... which might mean that the equation is in terms of log base 10, but I think that's correct. Also, perhaps I should have used more precise values.

Wait, let me recalculate P at T=350 K.

P = (-2400/350) -5.30 * log(350) +23.60.

-2400/350 = -6.85714.

log(350) ≈ 2.54407.

-5.30 * 2.54407 ≈ -13.483.

So P = (-6.85714) + (-13.483) +23.60 ≈ (-20.34) +23.60 = 3.26 mmHg.

That's correct.

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in the formula for L. Let me re-express the Clausius-Clapeyron equation correctly.

The equation is dP/dT = L/(TΔV).

But ΔV is the volume change upon vaporization. For an ideal gas, the volume is nRT/P. Since we're considering 1 mole, n=1, so ΔV = V_gas - V_liquid ≈ V_gas = RT/P.

So ΔV ≈ RT/P.

Substituting into the equation: dP/dT = L/(T*(RT/P)) = L/(R T^2 / P) ) = (L P)/(R T^2).

So rearranged, L = (R T^2 / P) * (dP/dT).

Wait, that's what I did earlier. So the formula is correct.

Hmm, but perhaps I made a mistake in the units. The pressure P is in mmHg, but I used R in cal/(mol·K). Let me check the units again.

R is 8.314 J/(mol·K), which is 1.987 cal/(mol·K).

But pressure P is in mmHg. I need to convert that to Pascals or something else?

Wait, no, because in the formula, P is in the same units as when R is used. Let me think: when using R in J/(mol·K), pressure should be in Pascals. But in this case, I used R in cal/(mol·K), so perhaps I should express P in different units.

Alternatively, maybe I should use R in mmHg·K/(mol) terms. Let me see.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to convert mmHg to Pascals. 1 mmHg ≈ 133.322 Pascals.

So P = 3.26 mmHg ≈ 3.26 * 133.322 ≈ 434.6 Pa.

But then, R is 8.314 J/(mol·K), so the units would work out.

Wait, let me try this approach.

Compute L using SI units:

L = (R * T^2 / P) * (dP/dT).

Where R=8.314 J/(mol·K), T=350 K, P=434.6 Pa, dP/dT=0.00445 mmHg/K.

Wait, but dP/dT is in mmHg/K. I need to convert that to Pascals per Kelvin.

0.00445 mmHg/K * 133.322 Pa/mmHg ≈ 0.00445 * 133.322 ≈ 0.596 Pa/K.

So now, L = (8.314 J/(mol·K)) * (350 K)^2 * (0.596 Pa/K) / (434.6 Pa).

Compute each part:

350^2 = 122500 K².

Multiply by 0.596 Pa/K: 122500 * 0.596 ≈ 72980 Pa·K.

Divide by 434.6 Pa: 72980 / 434.6 ≈ 167.9 ≈ 168 J/mol.

Wait, that's 168 J/mol, which is 168 / 4.184 ≈ 40 cal/mol. That's way too low. That can't be right. The options are all in the thousands of calories per mole.

I must have messed up somewhere. Maybe I'm using the wrong approach. Let me think again.

Alternative approach: The latent heat of vaporization can be calculated using the formula:

L = (ΔP * R * T) / (Δ(1/P)).

Wait, not sure. Maybe another approach is to use the equation for vapor pressure and integrate to find the area under the curve, but that seems complicated.

Wait, perhaps I should consider using the formula for the latent heat based on the change in entropy. Since ΔG = 0 at the boiling point, ΔH = TΔS.

And ΔS can be found using the change in entropy due to vaporization, which is S_gas - S_liquid. But S_liquid is negligible, so S ≈ R ln(P/P°), where P° is standard pressure (1 atm).

Wait, but I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, the entropy change ΔS = S_gas - S_liquid = S_gas, since S_liquid is much smaller.

The entropy of vapor is S = R ln(P) + constant. So ΔS = R ln(P) - R ln(P_liquid), but P_liquid is zero, which doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps using the standard pressure.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try another approach. The latent heat of vaporization can be found using the formula:

L = (P * R * T) / (1 - (P/P°)),

where P° is standard atmospheric pressure. But I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is L = (R * T^2) * (dP/dT) / P.

Wait, that's what I did earlier, but it gave a very low value. Let me check that again.

Wait, let me recalculate using more precise numbers.

Compute dP/dT at T=350 K:

dP/dT = (2400)/(350^2) - (5.30)/350.

2400 / 122500 ≈ 0.0195918 mmHg/K.

5.30 / 350 ≈ 0.0151429 mmHg/K.

So dP/dT ≈ 0.0195918 - 0.0151429 ≈ 0.0044489 mmHg/K.

P at T=350 K is 3.26 mmHg, as before.

So using L = (R * T^2 / P) * (dP/dT).

R = 8.314 J/(mol·K) = 1.987 cal/(mol·K).

Compute R*T^2 = 1.987 * 350^2 = 1.987 * 122500 ≈ 243,487.5 cal·K/mol.

Wait, no, wait: R is in cal/(mol·K), T is in K. So R*T^2 would have units (cal/(mol·K)) * K^2 = cal·K/mol.

Then, divide by P in mmHg, but that's not compatible. Wait, perhaps I should convert P to Pascals for this calculation.

Wait, maybe I should use R in J units. Let me try again.

R = 8.314 J/(mol·K).

T = 350 K.

dP/dT = 0.00445 mmHg/K = 0.00445 * 133.322 Pa/K ≈ 0.596 Pa/K.

P = 3.26 mmHg = 3.26 * 133.322 ≈ 434.6 Pa.

So L = (8.314 J/(mol·K)) * (350)^2 * (0.596 Pa/K) / (434.6 Pa).

Compute step by step:

350^2 = 122500 K².

Multiply by 0.596 Pa/K: 122500 * 0.596 ≈ 72980 Pa·K.

Divide by 434.6 Pa: 72980 / 434.6 ≈ 167.9 J/mol.

Convert J to cal: 167.9 J/mol ≈ 167.9 / 4.184 ≈ 40 cal/mol. That's way too low.

Wait, that can't be right. The options are in thousands. So I must have made a mistake in the approach.

Alternative approach: Maybe I should use the Antoine equation, which relates vapor pressure to temperature, and find the latent heat from that. The given equation is similar to the Antoine equation.

The Antoine equation is log P = A - (B/(T + C)).

In this problem, the equation is P = (-2400)/T -5.30 log T +23.60.

Wait, that's not in the form of the Antoine equation. Perhaps it's better to express it as log P = ... Let me see.

Wait, let me take the given equation and express it in terms of log P.

Given P = (-2400)/T -5.30 log T +23.60.

Wait, but that seems tricky because P is expressed as a function of 1/T and log T, which complicates taking the log.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that at the boiling point, the chemical potential of liquid and vapor are equal, but I'm not sure how to apply that here.

Wait, perhaps I should look for a different approach. Another way to find latent heat is via the area under the P-V curve during vaporization, but without knowing the volume change, that's difficult.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the latent heat is the enthalpy change at constant pressure, so ΔH = q_p = mL.

But I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for the relationship between the latent heat and the derivative of the vapor pressure.

Wait, another thought: The latent heat can be found using the formula:

L = (P * R * T) / (dP/dT).

Wait, let me test this.

Using P=3.26 mmHg, R=1.987 cal/(mol·K), T=350 K, dP/dT=0.00445 mmHg/K.

So L = (3.26 * 1.987 * 350) / 0.00445.

Calculate numerator: 3.26 * 1.987 ≈ 6.49. 6.49 * 350 ≈ 2271.5 cal/mol.

Denominator: 0.00445.

So L ≈ 2271.5 / 0.00445 ≈ 510,000 cal/mol. That's way too high, which can't be right.

Wait, perhaps the formula isn't correct. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe I should use the formula L = (P * R * T^2) / (dP/dT).

So L = (3.26 mmHg * 1.987 cal/(mol·K) * (350 K)^2) / 0.00445 mmHg/K.

Wait, let's compute this.

First, 350^2 = 122500.

Multiply by R: 1.987 * 122500 ≈ 243,487.5 cal·K/mol.

Multiply by P: 243,487.5 * 3.26 ≈ 793,745.5 cal·K·mmHg/mol.

Divide by dP/dT (0.00445 mmHg/K): 793,745.5 / 0.00445 ≈ 178,372,810 cal/mol. That's way too high, so this approach must be wrong.

I'm clearly missing something here. Maybe I should look up the standard latent heat of vaporization for CCl4. From memory, I think it's around 30-40 kJ/mol, which is about 7,000-10,000 cal/mol. So the options given are in that range.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation earlier. Let me try the first method again more carefully.

Using L = (R * T^2 / P) * (dP/dT).

R = 1.987 cal/(mol·K).

T =350 K.

dP/dT=0.00445 mmHg/K.

P=3.26 mmHg.

So L = (1.987) * (350^2) * 0.00445 / 3.26.

Compute 350^2 = 122,500.

Multiply by 0.00445: 122500 * 0.00445 = 545.125.

Divide by 3.26: 545.125 /3.26 ≈ 167.34.

Multiply by R: 1.987 * 167.34 ≈ 333.3 cal/mol.

That's way off from the options given. So I must have made a mistake in the approach.

Alternative idea: Maybe the equation given is for P in mmHg, and I need to use the relationship between the latent heat and the slope of the vapor pressure curve in a different way.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula for the latent heat in terms of the temperature at the boiling point. Let me look for another approach.

Wait, I found a formula online once that L = ( (P * R * T) ) / ( (dP/dT) * (1 + (P/P0)) ), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to use the Clapeyron equation in terms of the molar volume. Let me write it again.

Clapeyron equation: dP/dT = (L)/(TΔV).

Assuming ΔV ≈ RT/P, then:

dP/dT ≈ L / (T*(RT/P)) ) = L P / (R T²).

Rearranged, L = (R T² dP/dT) / P.

Which is what I did earlier. So perhaps the calculation is correct, but the result is much lower than the options, which suggests I made a mistake in the differentiation.

Wait, let me recheck the differentiation of P(T).

P(T) = (-2400)/T -5.30 log T +23.60.

dP/dT = d/dT (-2400 T^{-1}) ) + d/dT (-5.30 log T) + 0.

d/dT (-2400 T^{-1}) = 2400 T^{-2} = 2400 / T².

d/dT (-5.30 log T) = -5.30 / T.

So dP/dT = 2400/(T²) -5.30/T.

At T=350:

2400/(350^2) = 2400/122500 ≈ 0.01959 mmHg/K.

5.30/350 ≈ 0.01514 mmHg/K.

So dP/dT ≈ 0.00445 mmHg/K.

That's correct.

Wait, but maybe I should have considered that the equation is in terms of log base e or something else. Wait, the problem says log without a base, but usually in chemistry, log is base 10.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of P at T=350 K.

Let me recalculate P:

P = (-2400/350) -5.30 log(350) +23.60.

-2400/350 = -6.85714.

log(350) ≈ 2.54407.

-5.30 * 2.54407 ≈ -13.483.

So P = (-6.85714) + (-13.483) +23.60 = (-20.339) +23.60 ≈ 3.261 mmHg.

That's correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem assumes that the latent heat is the enthalpy change at constant pressure, and given that, I should find L using the equation L = (ΔH) = nΔE + PΔV, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for latent heat in terms of the slope of the vapor pressure curve, considering the specific volume.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the molar volume of the vapor at 350 K and P=3.26 mmHg.

Vapor pressure P=3.26 mmHg = 3.26/760 atm ≈ 0.00429 atm.

Using PV = nRT, for 1 mole, V = RT/P.

R=0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K).

So V = (0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K)) * 350 K / 0.00429 atm ≈ (0.0821 *350) / 0.00429 ≈ 28.735 /0.00429 ≈ 6690 L/mol.

Which is 6.69 m³/mol.

Now, using the Clapeyron equation: dP/dT = L/(TΔV).

ΔV = V_gas - V_liquid ≈ V_gas =6.69 m³/mol.

So dP/dT = L/(T * ΔV).

Rearranged: L = T * ΔV * dP/dT.

But wait, the units here are in m³, atm, etc. Let me convert everything to consistent units.

dP/dT is in mmHg/K, which is 0.00445 mmHg/K.

We need to convert dP/dT to atm/K.

1 mmHg = 1/760 atm, so 0.00445 mmHg/K = 0.00445 /760 atm/K ≈ 0.000005855 atm/K.

Now, L = T * ΔV * dP/dT.

T=350 K.

ΔV=6.69 m³/mol.

dP/dT=0.000005855 atm/K.

So L =350 *6.69 *0.000005855.

Calculate:

350 *6.69 ≈ 2341.5.

2341.5 *0.000005855 ≈ 0.01375 atm·m³/mol.

But 1 atm·m³ = 101.325 J (since 1 atm = 101325 Pa, 1 m³, so 101325 *1 = 101325 J ≈ 101.325 kJ).

Wait, 1 atm·m³ = 101325 J = 101.325 kJ.

So 0.01375 atm·m³ = 0.01375 *101325 J ≈ 1392 J/mol ≈ 333 cal/mol.

Again, same result. So I'm getting about 333 cal/mol, which is way below the options given. But that can't be right because from what I remember, CCl4's latent heat is around 30-40 kJ/mol, which is 7,000-10,000 cal/mol.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in converting units when calculating ΔV. Let me check again.

Wait, R is 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K).

At T=350 K and P=3.26 mmHg = 3.26/760 atm ≈ 0.00429 atm.

So V = nRT/P = (1 mol)(0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K))(350 K) / 0.00429 atm ≈ (0.0821 *350) /0.00429 ≈28.735 /0.00429 ≈6690 L/mol.

Convert L to m³: 6690 L = 6.69 m³/mol.

That's correct.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is that I should have used the slope in different units. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the equation in terms of the reciprocal of pressure.

Wait, another approach: The latent heat can be calculated using the formula:

L = ( (P * R * T) ) / ( (dP/dT) * (1 + (P/P0)) )

But I'm not sure about this. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula in terms of the Gibbs free energy.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the latent heat is the enthalpy change at the boiling point, and since dG=0 at equilibrium, dH = T dS.

But I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that I'm using the wrong formula. Let me look for another way.

Wait, I've found that the latent heat of vaporization can be calculated using the formula:

L = ( (P * R * T) ) / ( (dP/dT) )

But I tried that earlier and got around 510,000 cal/mol, which is way too high.

Wait, perhaps I should multiply by (1 + something), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the latent heat is given by:

L = (R * T^2) * (dP/dT) / (P).

Which is what I did, but the result is too low.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sign of dP/dT. Let me check the derivative again.

P(T) = (-2400)/T -5.30 log T +23.60.

dP/dT = 2400/T² -5.30/T.

At T=350, dP/dT=0.00445 mmHg/K, which is positive. So pressure increases with temperature, which makes sense.

Wait, but maybe I should have considered that the latent heat is positive, so the calculation must yield a positive value, which it does.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the given equation for P is in mmHg, and I should have used different units for R.

Wait, let me try using R in mmHg·K/(mol). Wait, R is 62.3637 L·mmHg/(mol·K).

So R =62.3637 L·mmHg/(mol·K).

Now, let's compute L using R in these units.

L = (R * T^2 * dP/dT) / P.

R=62.3637 L·mmHg/(mol·K).

T=350 K.

dP/dT=0.00445 mmHg/K.

P=3.26 mmHg.

So L = (62.3637 L·mmHg/(mol·K)) * (350)^2 * 0.00445 mmHg/K /3.26 mmHg.

Calculate step by step.

350^2 = 122500.

Multiply by 0.00445: 122500 *0.00445 ≈545.125.

So now, L = (62.3637 *545.125) /3.26.

Compute 62.3637 *545.125 ≈62.3637 *545 ≈33,997.3 L·mmHg/(mol).

Divide by 3.26 mmHg: 33,997.3 /3.26 ≈10,426 L/(mol).

Now, convert L to m³: 1 L=0.001 m³, so 10,426 L/mol =10.426 m³/mol.

Now, convert to J: 1 m³·atm =101325 J.

But pressure P is in mmHg, which is 3.26 mmHg. Wait, no, perhaps I should find the energy in J.

Wait, no, I think I'm mixing units again. Let me try a different approach.

Wait, since R is 62.3637 L·mmHg/(mol·K), and L is in (L·mmHg)/(mol), I need to convert that to J/mol.

1 L·mmHg = 127.324 Pa·m³ (since 1 mmHg = 133.322 Pa, 1 L=0.001 m³, so 0.001 m³ *133.322 Pa = 0.133322 J).

So 1 L·mmHg ≈ 0.133322 J.

So L ≈10,426 L·mmHg/mol *0.133322 J/(L·mmHg) ≈10,426 *0.133322 ≈1390 J/mol ≈333 cal/mol.

Same result as before. So I'm stuck. The calculation consistently gives around 333 cal/mol, but the options are much higher.

Wait, perhaps the given equation is for pressure in different units, like kPa, but the problem states it's mmHg. Alternatively, perhaps the equation is in terms of log base e, but I assumed base 10.

Let me check if the equation uses natural logarithm. If so, then log T would be ln T, which would change the calculation.

Wait, the problem says "log", which is typically base 10. But let me try using natural log and see.

If the equation is P = (-2400)/T -5.30 ln T +23.60.

Then, P at T=350 would be:

-2400/350 ≈-6.857.

ln(350) ≈5.856.

-5.30 *5.856 ≈-31.04.

So P ≈-6.857 -31.04 +23.60 ≈-14.3. That's negative, which can't be right for vapor pressure. So no, the equation must be using base 10 log.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the equation is in terms of ln T, but that leads to a negative pressure, which is impossible. So that's not the case.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the equation is given as P in terms of reciprocal or something else. Alternatively, perhaps I should have taken the derivative of P with respect to 1/T.

Wait, the equation is P = -2400/T -5.30 log T +23.60.

If I let x=1/T, then P = -2400 x -5.30 log(1/x) +23.60.

Wait, log(1/x) = -log x, so P = -2400 x +5.30 log x +23.60.

Then, dP/dx = -2400 +5.30*(1/x).

But dP/dT = dP/dx * dx/dT = (-2400 +5.30/x) * (-1/T²).

Wait, maybe that's complicating things further. I'm not sure.

At this point, I'm stuck and can't get a value that matches the options. I think I must have made a mistake in my approach, but I can't figure out where. Given that, perhaps I should look for another way or consider that the correct answer is around 7,000 cal/mol, which is option C.

To determine the latent heat of vaporization of liquid carbon tetrachloride (CCl₄) at its boiling point of 350 K, the problem provides the vapor pressure as a function of temperature:

\[
P(T) = -\frac{2400}{T} - 5.30 \log T + 23.60 \quad \text{(in mmHg)}.
\]

The latent heat of vaporization, \( L \), can be calculated using the Clausius-Clapeyron equation:

\[
\frac{dP}{dT} = \frac{L}{T \Delta V},
\]

where \( \Delta V \) is the volume change during vaporization. For an ideal gas, \( \Delta V \approx \frac{RT}{P} \), where \( R \) is the gas constant, \( T \) is the temperature, and \( P \) is the vapor pressure at the boiling point.

### Step 1: Differentiate \( P(T) \) to find \( \frac{dP}{dT} \)
The given equation is:

\[
P(T) = -\frac{2400}{T} - 5.30 \log T + 23.60.
\]

Differentiating with respect to \( T \):

\[
\frac{dP}{dT} = \frac{2400}{T^2} - \frac{5.30}{T}.
\]

At \( T = 350 \, \text{K} \):

\[
\frac{dP}{dT} = \frac{2400}{350^2} - \frac{5.30}{350}.
\]

Calculating each term:

\[
\frac{2400}{350^2} = \frac{2400}{122500} \approx 0.01959 \, \text{mmHg/K},
\]
\[
\frac{5.30}{350} \approx 0.01514 \, \text{mmHg/K}.
\]

Thus:

\[
\frac{dP}{dT} \approx 0.01959 - 0.01514 = 0.00445 \, \text{mmHg/K}.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate \( P \) at \( T = 350 \, \text{K} \)
Substitute \( T = 350 \, \text{K} \) into the equation for \( P(T) \):

\[
P = -\frac{2400}{350} - 5.30 \log(350) + 23.60.
\]

Calculate each term:

\[
-\frac{2400}{350} \approx -6.857 \, \text{mmHg},
\]
\[
\log(350) \approx 2.544, \quad -5.30 \cdot 2.544 \approx -13.483 \, \text{mmHg}.
\]

Adding these:

\[
P = -6.857 - 13.483 + 23.60 \approx 3.26 \, \text{mmHg}.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate \( L \) using the Clausius-Clapeyron equation
The Clausius-Clapeyron equation can be rearranged to solve for \( L \):

\[
L = \frac{R T^2}{P} \cdot \frac{dP}{dT}.
\]

Here, \( R = 8.314 \, \text{J/(mol·K)} \) (converted to \( \text{cal/(mol·K)} \) as \( R \approx 1.987 \, \text{cal/(mol·K)} \)), \( T = 350 \, \text{K} \), \( P = 3.26 \, \text{mmHg} \), and \( \frac{dP}{dT} = 0.00445 \, \text{mmHg/K} \).

Substitute the values:

\[
L = \frac{(1.987) \cdot (350)^2 \cdot 0.00445}{3.26}.
\]

Calculate step by step:

\[
350^2 = 122500, \quad 122500 \cdot 0.00445 \approx 545.125,
\]
\[
545.125 / 3.26 \approx 167.34, \quad 1.987 \cdot 167.34 \approx 333.3 \, \text{cal/mol}.
\]

### Step 4: Analyze the result
The calculated value of \( L \approx 333 \, \text{cal/mol} \) is significantly lower than the provided options, which range from 5,000 to 9,500 cal/mol. This discrepancy suggests a potential error in the approach or units. However, based on the options and typical values for the latent heat of vaporization of CCl₄, the most reasonable choice is:

**C: 7,000 cal/mol.**
