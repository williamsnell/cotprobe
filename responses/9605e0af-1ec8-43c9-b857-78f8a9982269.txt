Okay, so I've got this question about interpolating polynomials. Hmm, I remember that interpolation is about finding a polynomial that passes through a set of given points. The question is asking about the maximum possible degree of the minimal-degree interpolating polynomial p(x) for a real-valued function f(x) at n+1 distinct points x0, x1, ..., xn.

Wait, minimal-degree polynomial... Oh right, I think the minimal degree is the smallest degree that can fit all the points. But the question is about the maximum possible degree of such a minimal polynomial. That's a bit confusing. Let me think.

So, if we have n+1 points, the general approach is to use polynomial interpolation. The Lagrange interpolation formula, for example, gives a polynomial of degree at most n that passes through all n+1 points. But that's the degree when the function is exactly represented by a polynomial of degree n.

But wait, the minimal-degree interpolating polynomial—oh, wait, minimal in terms of the smallest degree possible to fit all points. So if the function f(x) is a polynomial of degree m, then the minimal interpolating polynomial would have degree m. But the question is about the maximum possible degree of p(x) when considering all possible functions f(x). 

So, for any function f(x), the minimal-degree polynomial that interpolates it at n+1 points can't have a degree higher than n, right? Because with n+1 points, you can always find a polynomial of degree n that passes through them. But could there be a case where the minimal degree is higher than n? That doesn't seem right. Because if you have n+1 points, the interpolating polynomial can't be of higher degree than n. Wait no, actually, the interpolating polynomial is of degree at most n, but the minimal degree could be lower if f(x) itself is a lower-degree polynomial.

Wait, but the question is about the maximum possible degree of p(x). So the maximum degree would be when f(x) is a polynomial of degree n, making p(x) also degree n. But wait, wait—no, because the minimal degree would be n if f(x) is exactly a degree n polynomial. But wait, could it be higher?

Wait, no. Because if f(x) is a higher-degree polynomial, say degree m > n, but we're interpolating at only n+1 points, then the minimal-degree interpolating polynomial would have degree n. Because you can't uniquely determine a higher-degree polynomial with just n+1 points. So for example, if f(x) is a degree m polynomial where m > n, the interpolating polynomial would still be of degree n because that's the minimal needed to fit the points. Wait, no, that's not quite right.

Wait, no, actually, the minimal-degree interpolating polynomial for any function f(x) at n+1 points is exactly n, because you can always find a unique polynomial of degree n that passes through those points, and that's the minimal degree needed. So the maximum possible degree of p(x) is n. So looking at the options, that's option G: n.

Wait, but wait, I'm getting confused. Because if f(x) is a function that's not a polynomial, then the interpolating polynomial p(x) is still a polynomial of degree at most n, right? Because for n+1 points, you can always fit a degree n polynomial. So the minimal degree is n, but could it be higher?

No, because the minimal degree is the smallest degree that can pass through all points. So if f(x) is a higher-degree polynomial, say degree m >n, would the minimal interpolating polynomial be degree n or m?

Wait, no. Because if you have f(x) = x^{m}, and you have n+1 points, then the interpolating polynomial p(x) will be of degree n, because that's the minimal degree needed to fit n+1 points. So regardless of f(x), the minimal degree is n. So the maximum possible degree of p(x) is n.

Wait, but the question says "the maximum possible degree of p(x)". So if f(x) is a polynomial of degree n, then p(x) would also be degree n. If f(x) is a higher-degree polynomial, then p(x) would still be degree n, because that's the minimal degree needed. So the maximum possible degree is n, since p(x) can't be higher than n to fit n+1 points.

Wait, but wait, is there a case where the minimal interpolating polynomial could be higher than n? No, because with n+1 points, the unique interpolating polynomial is of degree at most n. So the minimal degree is n, which is also the maximum possible in this scenario.

So the answer should be G: n.
</think>

The minimal-degree interpolating polynomial for a function at \( n+1 \) distinct points is at most degree \( n \). This is because \( n+1 \) points uniquely determine a polynomial of degree \( n \), and the minimal degree cannot exceed this. Therefore, the maximum possible degree of \( p(x) \) is \( n \).
