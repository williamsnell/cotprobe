Okay, so I need to figure out how much property tax Mr. Williams has to pay. Let's see, the problem says his property is assessed at $7,800, and the tax rate is $2.80 per $100. Hmm, I think I remember that property tax is calculated by multiplying the assessed value by the tax rate, but I'm not entirely sure about the exact method.

Wait, the tax rate is given per $100. So that means for every $100 of assessed value, the tax is $2.80. So I guess I need to find out how many hundreds are in $7,800 and then multiply that by $2.80.

Let me break it down. $7,800 divided by $100 is 78. So there are 78 hundreds in $7,800. Now, I multiply 78 by $2.80. Let me do that calculation.

78 times 2.80. Hmm, let's see. 70 times 2.80 is 196, because 70*2=140 and 70*0.80=56, so 140+56=196. Then 8 times 2.80 is 22.40. So adding those together, 196 + 22.40 equals 218.40. So the tax should be $218.40.

Looking at the options, option A is $218.40, so that must be the correct answer. I think I did that right. Another way to check is to calculate 2.80% of $7,800. Wait, because $2.80 per $100 is the same as 2.80%. So 7,800 * 0.028 equals... let me compute that. 7,800 * 0.02 is 156, and 7,800 * 0.008 is 62.40. Adding those together, 156 + 62.40 is 218.40. Yep, same result. So I'm confident that A is the correct choice.

To determine Mr. Williams' property tax, calculate 2.80% of $7,800. This is done by multiplying 7,800 by 0.028, resulting in $218.40.
