Okay, so I've got this question about machine learning concepts, specifically about back-propagation and VC dimension. I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to break it down.

First, the question has two statements, and I need to determine if each is true or false. Then, based on that, select the correct option from A to D.

Statement 1: "The back-propagation algorithm learns a globally optimal neural network with hidden layers."

Hmm, I remember that backpropagation is a method used to train neural networks by adjusting weights based on the error gradient. But wait, I think backpropagation alone doesn't guarantee a global optimum. It's a local optimization technique, right? It uses gradient descent, which can get stuck in local minima. So even with hidden layers, it might not find the absolute best solution every time. So I think Statement 1 is False.

Statement 2: "The VC dimension of a line should be at most 2, since I can find at least one case of 3 points that cannot be shattered by any line."

Okay, VC dimension measures the capacity of a model to shatter data points. For a line (which is a linear classifier), the VC dimension is 3. Wait, no, wait. Wait, in 2D space, a line can shatter 3 points if they're in a certain configuration, but can it shatter any three points? I think that's where it's tricky. Wait, no, actually, a line can shatter 3 points if they're arranged such that the line can separate all possible dichotomies. But I recall that the VC dimension for a line in 2D is actually 3. Wait, no, no. Wait, the VC dimension of a line is 3 because it's possible to shatter 3 points. But the statement says the VC dimension is at most 2 because there exists a case where 3 points can't be shattered. That would mean the VC dimension is less than 3, which contradicts what I remember.

Wait, maybe I'm confusing. Let me think. The VC dimension is the maximum number of points that can be shattered. For a line in 2D, the VC dimension is 3. So any set of 3 points can be shattered by a line unless they're colinear. So if the points are colinear, a line can't shatter them because all possible labelings would require the line to pass through them, which isn't possible. So the VC dimension is 3 because there exists some sets of 3 points that can be shattered, but not all. But the statement is saying that the VC dimension is at most 2 because there's a case where 3 points can't be shattered. That's incorrect because the VC dimension is determined by the maximum number that can be shattered, regardless of some points not being shattered. So if there exists at least one set of 3 points that can be shattered, the VC dimension is 3, not 2. Therefore, the statement is False because the VC dimension is actually 3, not 2.

Wait, but the statement says the VC dimension is at most 2 because there's a case of 3 points that can't be shattered. So the reasoning is that since some 3 points can't be shattered, the VC dimension is 2. But that's wrong. The VC dimension is the maximum number of points that can be shattered. So even if some 3 points can't be, as long as there exists a set that can, the VC dimension is 3. So the statement is incorrect. So Statement 2 is False.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me double-check. The VC dimension is the largest set of points that can be shattered. If a model can shatter 3 points, its VC is 3. If it can't shatter any 3 points, then it's 2 or lower. But a line in 2D can shatter 3 points when they're not colinear. So the VC dimension is 3. Therefore, the statement claims the VC dimension is at most 2 because 3 points can't be shattered in some cases. But since the line can shatter some 3 points, the VC dimension is 3, making the statement False.

Wait, I'm getting conflicting thoughts. Let me think again. If the VC dimension is the maximum number of points that can be shattered, and a line can shatter 3 points (when they're not colinear), then the VC dimension is 3. Therefore, the statement that the VC dimension is at most 2 is False. So Statement 2 is False.

Wait, but the statement says "the VC dimension of a line should be at most 2, since I can find at least one case of 3 points that cannot be shattered by any line." So the reasoning is that because there exists a case where 3 points can't be shattered, the VC dimension is <=2. But that's not how VC dimension works. The VC dimension is the maximum number of points that can be shattered. So even if some 3-point sets can't be shattered, as long as there's at least one set that can, the VC dimension is 3. So the statement is incorrect. Thus, Statement 2 is False.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Let me look it up mentally. Yes, the VC dimension of a linear classifier in 2D is indeed 3. So the correct VC dimension is 3, which means Statement 2 is False. So both statements are False.

So looking back at the options:

A: False, False → Both statements are false.

B: True, True → Both true.

C: False, True → Statement 1 false, 2 true.

D: True, False → 1 true, 2 false.

Wait, but earlier I thought Statement 1 is False, and Statement 2 is False, so the correct option is A: False, False.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure. For Statement 1, backpropagation with hidden layers. I thought it's a local optimizer, so it doesn't find the global optimum. So Statement 1 is False. Statement 2 is also False because the VC dimension is 3, not 2.

So the answer should be A: False, False.

The back-propagation algorithm does not guarantee a globally optimal neural network because it uses gradient descent, which can get stuck in local minima. Therefore, Statement 1 is false. The VC dimension of a line in 2D is 3 because there exist sets of 3 points that can be shattered, even if some sets cannot. Thus, Statement 2 is also false.
