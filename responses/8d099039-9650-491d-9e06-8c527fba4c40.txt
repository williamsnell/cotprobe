Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. The question has two parts, (a) and (b). 

Part (a) is asking how much heat energy is produced by a 5-kg rock that falls a vertical distance of 10 meters before it strikes the earth. It also mentions that the rock was initially at rest. Hmm, I remember from my physics classes that when an object falls, it converts its gravitational potential energy into kinetic energy. But wait, the question is about heat energy produced. Oh right, when the rock hits the ground, it might deform or cause some sound, but more importantly, the energy is dissipated as heat. So I think I should calculate the potential energy loss and that would be the heat energy produced.

The formula for gravitational potential energy is PE = mgh, where m is mass, g is acceleration due to gravity, and h is height. So m is 5 kg, g is approximately 9.8 m/s², and h is 10 m. Let me plug in the numbers: 5 kg * 9.8 m/s² * 10 m. 

Calculating that: 5 * 9.8 is 49, then 49 * 10 is 490 J. So the heat energy produced should be 490 J. Now I'll check the options to see which has 490 J as the first part or close to it. Looking at the options: option I says 4.9 × 10² J, which is 490 J. Option A is 5.0 × 10², which is 500 J, a bit higher. Option J is 4.0 × 10², which is 400, lower. So I think I is correct for part (a).

Now part (b) is asking how much the temperature of 1 kg of water would be raised by the rock striking the earth's surface. The given data says that 4.19 × 10³ J of heat energy is required to raise the temperature of 1 kg of water by 1 °K. Wait, so we need to find the temperature change (delta T) when 490 J is applied to 1 kg of water.

The formula for heat energy is Q = mcΔT, where m is mass, c is specific heat capacity, and ΔT is the change in temperature. Rearranging for ΔT, we get ΔT = Q / (mc). Here, m is 1 kg, c is 4190 J/(kg·°C), and Q is 490 J. So ΔT = 490 / (1 * 4190). Let me calculate that: 490 divided by 4190. Let me see, 4190 goes into 490 approximately 0.1169 times. So that's about 0.117 °C or 0.117 °K. Looking at the options, I need to see which option's second part is around 0.117.

Looking at the options again: Option I's second part is 1.2 × 10^-1 °K, which is 0.12. That's close. Option A's second part is 1.2 × 10^-1 as well, same as I. But wait, wait, no, option I has 1.2 × 10^-1 for part (b). So if part (a) is 4.9 ×10² (490 J) and part (b) is 1.2 ×10^-1 (0.12), then option I matches both parts.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation for part (b). So Q is 490 J, m is 1 kg, c is 4190 J/kg°C. So ΔT = 490 /4190 = let's compute this accurately. 4190 divided into 490: 490 ÷ 4190 = approx 0.1169, so 0.117, which is 1.17 ×10^-1, not 1.2 ×10^-1. Wait, but 0.117 is approximately 0.12 when rounded to two significant figures. So 0.12 is 1.2 ×10^-1. So the temperature change would be about 0.12 °K.

Wait, but let me check the options again. Option I has first part 4.9e2 (490 J) and second part 1.2e-1 (0.12). So that's correct. But wait, looking at the options, option A is 5.0e2 (500 J) and 1.2e-1. So if part (a) were 500 J, that would be option A. But our calculation for part (a) was 490 J, so option I is correct for part (a), and part (b) is 0.12, so option I is the correct choice.

Wait, but wait another thing. Did I consider any energy loss? The problem assumes all the potential energy is converted into heat. So the calculation should be correct. So the answer should be option I.

The heat energy produced by the falling rock is calculated using the gravitational potential energy formula, resulting in 490 J. For the temperature change of water, using the heat energy and specific heat capacity, the temperature rise is approximately 0.12 °K. The correct option is I, matching both values.

Answer: I
