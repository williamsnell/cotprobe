Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about Addison's Disease, and I need to figure out which option is correct. Let me start by recalling what I know about Addison's Disease. 

Addison's Disease, if I remember correctly, is a condition related to the adrenal glands. The adrenal glands produce hormones like cortisol and aldosterone. When they don't produce enough of these hormones, it leads to Addison's Disease. 

Looking at the options, let me go through each one by one.

Option A: Results in frequent urination and thirst. Hmm, I think frequent urination and thirst are symptoms of diabetes, not necessarily Addison's. In fact, with Addison's, because aldosterone is low, the kidneys might retain more potassium and the person might have muscle weakness, but I'm not sure about frequent urination. Maybe not A.

Option B: It is a result of an overactive thyroid gland. No, that doesn't make sense. An overactive thyroid is hyperthyroidism, which is a different condition. Addison's is about the adrenal glands, so B is probably wrong.

Option C: High cholesterol levels are a common symptom. I don't recall high cholesterol being a symptom of Addison's. In fact, sometimes steroids like cortisol can affect cholesterol, but I'm not sure if low cortisol would lead to high cholesterol. Maybe not C.

Option D: It is a recognized cause of hypertension. Wait, aldosterone is involved in sodium and potassium balance, which affects blood pressure. If aldosterone is low, the body might retain potassium and have low sodium, which can cause low blood pressure, not hypertension. So D might be incorrect.

Option E: It is caused by excessive production of insulin. No, insulin is produced by the pancreas, and excessive insulin would relate to diabetes, not Addison's. So E is wrong.

Option F: It is a disease that affects the pituitary gland. No, the pituitary gland is involved in controlling other glands, like the adrenals. Addison's is about the adrenal glands themselves, so F isn't correct.

Option G: It is a form of cancer that affects the adrenal glands. Addison's is an endocrine disorder, not a cancer. So G is wrong.

Option H: Diabetes is a complication. I'm not sure. Addison's can cause issues like low blood sugar because of the lack of cortisol, but I don't think diabetes is a direct complication. Maybe H isn't correct.

Option I: Leads to generalized pigmentation. Oh, yes! I remember that one of the symptoms of Addison's is darkening of the skin, especially in areas like the hands, elbows, and knees. This is due to increased levels of melanocyte-stimulating hormone, which can be released when the adrenal glands are damaged. So I think I is correct.

Option J: It is due to a deficiency of prolactin hormone. Prolactin is related to milk production and other functions, but it's not directly linked to Addison's. So J is wrong.

So, putting it all together, the correct answer should be option I: Leads to generalized pigmentation.

The correct answer is I: Leads to generalized pigmentation.
