Okay, so I have this logic problem to solve. The question is about finding the best symbolization of a given English sentence using propositional logic (PL) formulas. The sentence is: "Since the university raised tuition, the president approved of it and the board didn't prevent it." 

First, I need to break down the sentence into its components. Let me identify the main parts and the relationships between them. 

The sentence starts with "Since the university raised tuition," which seems to be the cause or the antecedent. The rest of the sentence is the effect: "the president approved of it and the board didn't prevent it." So, this looks like a conditional statement where the university raising tuition (U) leads to two things happening: the president approved (P) and the board didn't prevent it (~B). 

Wait, let me make sure. The structure is "Since U, P and ~B." So, it's like "If U, then P and ~B." So the main connective here would be a conditional, where U implies both P and ~B. 

In PL, the conditional is represented by ⊃, so U ⊃ (something). The "something" would be P and ~B connected by a conjunction, which is the dot symbol (•). So the formula should be U ⊃ (P • ~B). 

Looking at the options, I need to find which one matches this structure. Let me go through each option:

A: U • (P ⊃ ~B) → This is U and (P implies not B), which isn't the same because the original sentence doesn't say U and P imply not B. It says U implies both P and not B.

B: U ⊃ (P ∨ ~B) → U implies P or not B. But the original requires both P and not B to happen, not either/or.

C: (U ∨ P) • B → This is (U or P) and B. Doesn't fit because the original is a conditional, not a disjunction, and B is negated.

D: U ⊃ (~P • ~B) → U implies not P and not B. But the president approved, so P is true, not ~P.

E: (U ⊃ P) • B → U implies P, and B. But the original requires both P and ~B, not just B.

F: U ⊃ (P • B) → U implies P and B. But the board didn't prevent it, so B is ~B, not B.

G: (~U ⊃ P) • B → If not U, then P, and B. Doesn't fit because the condition is U, not ~U.

H: B ⊃ (U • P) → If B, then U and P. Opposite of what we need; the original is about U leading to P and ~B.

I: (P • ~B) ⊃ U → If P and ~B, then U. This is the converse of what we want; the original is U implies P and ~B.

J: U ⊃ (P • ~B) → Exactly matches what I thought earlier. U implies both P and ~B.

So, the correct answer should be J.

The sentence is a conditional where the university raising tuition (U) leads to both the president approving (P) and the board not preventing it (~B). The correct formula is U ⊃ (P • ~B), which matches option J.

Answer: J
