Question:

A tenant lived in a small apartment building that was owned by a landlord. In July, the landlord was killed in an accident. In August, the tenant brought an action against the administrator of the landlord's state. The tenant alleged that he and the landlord had a contract under the terms of which the landlord was supposed to pay him $50 a week to mow the lawn and perform small maintenance repairs for the other tenants. He claimed that the landlord had not paid him for the past six months. He testified that there was a written contract and that the landlord kept the only copy of it in his home. At trial, he called the landlord's accountant to testify about the contract. The accountant testified that she had seen the contract. She further testified about the terms of the contract, consistent with the tenant's testimony. She testified that the contract, along with many other documents pertaining to the landlord's business, had most likely been destroyed when the landlord's business office was robbed a few months earlier. The trial judge should rule that the accountant's. testimony is

Options:

A: admissible as a written admission by the party opponent.
B: admissible, because it corroborates the tenant's claims.
C: inadmissible, because the accountant's testimony is not the best evidence.
D: inadmissible under the Dead Man's Statute.
E: admissible as secondary evidence under the circumstances.
F: inadmissible, because the accountant is an interested party.
G: admissible, because it falls under the business record exception.
H: inadmissible, because it constitutes hearsay evidence.
I: inadmissible, due to the lack of physical contract as evidence.
J: admissible as an exception to the hearsay rule.

Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. So, the question is about evidence law, specifically hearsay exceptions. Let's break down the facts and the options.

The tenant is suing the landlord's estate, claiming the landlord didn't pay him for six months. He says there was a written contract, which the landlord kept. The tenant claims he had a copy, but the landlord did. The tenant called the landlord's accountant to testify. She says she saw the contract and knows its terms. She also testified that the contract was probably destroyed in a robbery at the landlord's office a few months back.

So, the issue here is whether the accountant's testimony about the contract is admissible. The tenant is trying to prove the existence and terms of the contract, but the only copy was with the landlord, who is now deceased.

First, I need to recall the rules about hearsay. Hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. Generally, hearsay is inadmissible, unless there's an exception.

Looking at the options, several relate to hearsay exceptions. Let's consider the options one by one.

Option A: Admissible as a written admission by a party opponent. A party admission is a statement offered against an opposing party that was made by the party's agent or employee on a matter within their authority. Here, the statement would be the contract terms. But the contract was written by the landlord, so it's an admission by a party opponent. However, the problem is that the contract is not presentâ€”the only copy was destroyed. So, can the testimony about the contract's terms count as an admission?

Option B: Admissible because it corroborates the tenant's claims. Corroboration isn't a basis for admissibility. Even if it supports the tenant's story, if the testimony is hearsay, it's still inadmissible unless an exception applies.

Option C: Inadmissible because the accountant's testimony is not the best evidence. The best evidence rule requires the original document when the content of the writing is in issue. But here, the tenant is trying to prove the existence and terms of the contract. Since the original is missing, maybe secondary evidence would be allowed. But the issue is whether the testimony is hearsay. The best evidence rule doesn't apply if the document is unavailable, but the problem is that the testimony might still be hearsay.

Option D: Inadmissible under the Dead Man's Statute. The Dead Man's Statute typically excludes testimony by a party's agent about communications with the deceased. But this is about a contract. Wait, the Dead Man's Statute (often called the "Dead Person Statute") in some jurisdictions prohibits a party from introducing evidence of a deceased party's statements unless the opposing party does so. Here, the landlord is deceased, and the tenant is trying to bring in testimony about the landlord's contract. So, under the Dead Man's Statute, the tenant (the opposing party) can introduce the landlord's statements. Because the landlord is the party against whom the statement is being offered, the Dead Man's Statute doesn't bar it. So D might not be correct.

Option E: Admissible as secondary evidence. Secondary evidence is allowed when the original is lost or destroyed, provided that the circumstances are explained. The tenant could introduce a copy or testimony about the content of the contract. But the accountant's testimony about the contract's terms is based on her personal knowledge (seeing the contract) and is not just about the content of a writing. So it's not about the best evidence rule but about hearsay. So E might not be the right choice here.

Option F: Inadmissible because the accountant is an interested party. The accountant's interest would affect her credibility, but it doesn't make her testimony inadmissible. It's a matter of weight, not admissibility. So F is incorrect.

Option G: Admissible under the business records exception. The business records exception allows records kept in the regular course of business to be admitted. But here, the accountant is testifying about the contract, which was a business document. However, the business records exception applies to the record itself, not to someone testifying about the contents unless they are based on the record. But the accountant is testifying from personal knowledge (she saw the contract), so maybe it's not about business records. Alternatively, if the contract is a business record, and she is testifying based on her knowledge of it, perhaps it's allowed. But I'm not sure if this applies here because the contract's existence is what's being contested, and the issue is more about hearsay.

Option H: Inadmissible because it's hearsay. If the accountant's testimony about the contract's terms is hearsay, then it's inadmissible unless an exception applies. The contract is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the terms, so it's hearsay. So H suggests it's inadmissible as hearsay, but there might be exceptions.

Option I: Inadmissible due to lack of physical contract as evidence. This relates to the best evidence rule. If the content of the writing is in issue, the original should be produced. But since the original was destroyed, secondary evidence might be allowed. But again, the main issue is whether the testimony is hearsay. So I is about best evidence, but the problem is more about hearsay.

Option J: Admissible as an exception to the hearsay rule. There are exceptions like admissions by a party opponent. Since the contract was made by the landlord (the party opponent), the tenant can offer it as an admission. The problem is that the original is destroyed, but admissions can be proven by other means, like testimony about the contents. So the accountant's testimony about the contract's terms would be an admission by a party opponent, which is an exception to hearsay.

Wait, but the contract is the landlord's own statement, so when the tenant offers it against the landlord's estate, it's an admission. So the testimony about the contract's terms would fall under the party admission exception, making it admissible. So J says it's admissible as an exception to hearsay, which would be correct.

Let me double-check. The options are:

A: admission by party opponent (written). But the original is missing. But an admission can be proven by other evidence, not just the writing. So the testimony is allowed.

E: secondary evidence. But the issue isn't best evidence; it's hearsay. So E is about best evidence, but the problem is about hearsay exception.

So the correct ruling is that the testimony is admissible under the party admission exception, making J correct.
</think>

The trial judge should rule that the accountant's testimony is admissible as an exception to the hearsay rule under the party admission exception. The contract is a statement by the landlord, a party opponent, and the tenant is offering it against the landlord's estate. The testimony about the contract's terms falls under this exception, even though the original document was destroyed.
