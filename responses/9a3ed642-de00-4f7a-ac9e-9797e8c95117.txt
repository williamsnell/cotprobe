The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

This question refers to the following information.
Source 1:
"Moreover, Sir, in our Kingdoms there is another great inconvenience which is of little service to God, and this is that many of our people, keenly desirous as they are of the wares and things of your Kingdoms, which are brought here by your people, and in order to satisfy their voracious appetite, seize many of our people, freed and exempt men, and very often it happens that they kidnap even noblemen and our relatives, and take them to be sold to the white men who are in our kingdoms."
Letter from King Afonso I of Kongo to King John III of Portugal, 1526
Source 2:
"This expedition has cost us much: it would be unreasonable to send it home with empty hands. Although our [principal] wish is to serve God and the pleasure of the king of Kongo, none the less you will make him understand—as though speaking in our name—what he should do to fill the ships, whether with slaves, or copper, or ivory."
Instructions from King Manuel of Portugal to his envoy in Kongo, 1512

Okay, so I have this history question about early modern Africa, specifically looking at two sources from the 16th century. The question is asking about the tone of the first letter and which development it reflects from the given options A to J. I need to figure out which option best fits.

Let me start by reading the sources carefully. 

Source 1 is a letter from King Afonso I of Kongo to King John III of Portugal in 1526. He's talking about a problem in their kingdoms. He mentions that their people are eager for goods from Portugal, so much so that they're kidnapping and selling people, including noblemen and relatives, to the white men in their kingdoms. It sounds like he's upset about the negative effects of this trade—kidnapping, loss of people, and the service to God not being properly done.

Source 2 is an instruction from King Manuel of Portugal to his envoy in Kongo in 1512. He says the expedition cost them much and they don't want to go home empty-handed. Their main goal is to serve God and please the king of Kongo, but they also want the envoy to make the Kongo king understand what to do to fill the ships—either with slaves, copper, or ivory. So, the Portuguese are pushing for trade, specifically mentioning items like slaves, which ties into the transatlantic trade.

Now, the question is about the tone of the first letter. King Afonso is expressing a problem. He's concerned about his people being kidnapped and sold, which suggests that the trade is causing social disruption. He's probably looking for help or some form of intervention from Portugal, as he's addressing the king of Portugal. But the main issue is the impact of the trade on his society.

Looking at the options, I need to see which development is reflected by this tone. Let's go through them:

A: Encouragement of European settlers. Not directly related; the letter is about people being taken, not settlers coming over.

B: Rising interest in European political structures. The letter doesn't talk about adopting political systems; it's about the negative effects of trade.

C: Vigorous resistance to European expeditions. The letter isn't about resisting expeditions but about the consequences of trade, like kidnapping.

D: Consolidation of states along the Atlantic coast. The letter doesn't directly talk about state consolidation; it's more about internal issues caused by trade.

E: Introduction of European agricultural methods. No mention of agriculture here.

F: Promotion of Christianity. While the letter mentions serving God, the main issue is the trade and its negative effects, not promoting Christianity itself.

G: Acceptance of European culture. The tone is more critical, not accepting, so probably not.

H: Establishment of Portuguese trading posts. The letter refers to trade, but the tone is about the negative impact, not the establishment itself.

I: Growing dependence on trade with Europe for manufactured goods. The letter talks about people desiring European goods, which could lead to dependence. But the tone is about the negative consequences—kidnapping and loss of people. It's more about the problem of dependence rather than the fact of dependence.

J: Diplomatic alliance with Portugal. The letter is from Kongo to Portugal, which suggests an existing alliance, but the tone is about a problem within that relationship rather than the alliance itself.

So, the tone in Source 1 reflects a problem arising from trade dependence. The people are so eager for European goods that they're engaging in harmful activities like kidnapping. This suggests that there's a growing dependence on European trade, which is causing social issues. Therefore, the tone best reflects option I: A growing dependence on trade with Europe for manufactured goods.

Wait, but another thought: the letter is more about the negative side effects, like the loss of people and the impact on society. So it's not just about dependence but the consequences of that dependence. But the options don't have an option about negative consequences; the closest is I, which talks about dependence leading to the need to obtain goods, which in turn leads to actions like kidnapping for trade.

Yes, so the answer should be I.

The tone of King Afonso I's letter reflects concern over the negative social impacts of trade with Europe, particularly the kidnapping and sale of people to obtain European goods. This highlights a growing dependence on trade with Europe, which is causing significant disruption. 

Answer: I
