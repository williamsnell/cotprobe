Question:

This question refers to the following information.
Gunpowder Weaponry: Europe vs. China
In Western Europe during the 1200s through the 1400s, early cannons, as heavy and as slow to fire as they were, proved useful enough in the protracted sieges that dominated warfare during this period that governments found it sufficiently worthwhile to pay for them and for the experimentation that eventually produced gunpowder weapons that were both more powerful and easier to move. By contrast, China, especially after the mid-1300s, was threatened mainly by highly mobile steppe nomads, against whom early gunpowder weapons, with their unwieldiness, proved of little utility. It therefore devoted its efforts to the improvement of horse archer units who could effectively combat the country's deadliest foe.
The argument in this passage most closely relates to which of the following large-scale questions about global history?

Options:

A: Why Silk Road commerce dwindled across the breadth of Eurasia after 1500 C.E.
B: How societies shared strategically important technologies with each other
C: How the threat of steppe nomads shaped China's military strategy in the 1300s
D: Why China and Europe had different military strategies during the Middle Ages
E: How the medieval climatic optimum affected the process of cultural diffusion
F: Why European states went on to attain military superiority over non-Western powers in the modern era
G: How the development of gunpowder weaponry influenced the outcomes of wars in the Middle Ages
H: How the geopolitical environment influenced the development of military technology in different regions
I: Why China chose to invest in horse archer units instead of gunpowder weaponry during the medieval period
J: How the development of gunpowder weaponry was influenced by the economic status of countries

Alright, so I've got this multiple-choice question about a passage comparing gunpowder weaponry in Europe and China. The question is asking which large-scale historical question the argument in the passage relates to, with options A through J.

First, I'll read the passage carefully. It talks about how in Western Europe from the 1200s to 1400s, early cannons were heavy and slow but useful in sieges, so governments invested in them. Over time, they became more powerful and mobile. In contrast, China, especially after the mid-1300s, faced threats from mobile steppe nomads. The early gunpowder weapons weren't useful because they were unwieldy, so China focused on improving horse archer units instead.

The main point seems to be about why Europe and China developed different military strategies regarding gunpowder weapons. Europe used them because sieges were common, while China didn't find them useful against mobile enemies and thus invested elsewhere.

Looking at the options:

A: About Silk Road decline after 1500. Doesn't seem related to gunpowder or military strategies.

B: How societies shared technologies. The passage doesn't discuss sharing, just the use in each region.

C: How steppe nomads shaped China's military in 1300s. The passage does mention this as a factor, but the broader point is the comparison between Europe and China.

D: Why China and Europe had different military strategies during the Middle Ages. This seems to fit because the passage discusses the differing strategies based on their military needs.

E: Climate affecting cultural diffusion. Not related to the passage's content.

F: Why Europe became superior in military in modern times. The passage is about medieval times, and this option is about modern era outcomes.

G: How gunpowder influenced war outcomes in Middle Ages. While the passage does discuss gunpowder's role, the focus is on why different regions used it differently.

H: How geopolitical environment influenced military tech development. This seems relevant because the environment (like sieges in Europe vs. nomadic threats in China) shaped their military tech choices.

I: Why China invested in horse archers instead of gunpowder. This is a specific point the passage makes, but the question is about a larger historical question.

J: Economic status influencing gunpowder development. The passage mentions governments paying for weapons, but it doesn't tie it to economic status but rather to military needs.

So, the passage is comparing how the military strategies and tech development in Europe and China diverged based on their geopolitical situations. Options D and H seem possible. The question is about the argument in the passage relating to a larger historical question.

Option D is about different military strategies, while H is about how the environment influenced military tech. The passage's argument is that their military strategies (use of gunpowder vs. horse archers) differed because of their respective threats. So it's about why the strategies were different, which is D. However, H is about the influence of the environment on tech development, which is also a valid angle.

Wait, the passage explains that the effectiveness of gunpowder in Europe vs. China's situation led to different strategies. So it's about how the geopolitical environment (threats) influenced their military tech development. So H might be more accurate.

But the question is about the argument in the passage relating to a larger historical question. The passage is making a point about differing military strategies due to different threats, so D is about the strategies, while H is about how the environment influenced tech development.

I think the best fit is H because the argument is that the environment (geopolitical) shaped their military tech. So the answer would be H.

The passage discusses how the geopolitical environment shaped the military strategies of Europe and China, particularly their approaches to gunpowder weaponry. In Europe, where sieges were common, gunpowder weapons were developed and used effectively, while in China, the threat of mobile steppe nomads led to a focus on horse archers instead. This highlights how the environment influenced military technology and strategy. Therefore, the argument most closely relates to how the geopolitical environment influenced the development of military technology in different regions.
