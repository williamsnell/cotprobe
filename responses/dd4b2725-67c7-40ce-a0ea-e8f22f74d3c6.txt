Question:

That modern Africans do not possess any Neandertal DNA indicates that:

Options:

A: Gene flow between Neandertals and anatomically modern humans must have occurred before Neandertals migrated out of Africa.
B: Gene flow between Neandertals and anatomically modern humans occurred after anatomically modern humans migrated out of Africa.
C: Neandertals who lived in Africa did not interbreed with anatomically modern humans, but must have followed them when they migrated out of Africa.
D: Interbreeding between anatomically modern humans and Neandertals never occurred.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about Neandertal DNA and modern Africans. The question says that modern Africans don't have any Neandertal DNA, and we need to pick what that indicates from the options A to J. Wait, actually the options are A to D as per the user's message. Hmm, maybe a typo, but I'll proceed with A to D.

First, I remember that Neandertals were a group of early humans, right? They were in Europe and parts of Asia, I think. Modern humans, Homo sapiens, migrated out of Africa around 70,000 to 100,000 years ago. I've read that when modern humans left Africa, they encountered Neandertals and interbred with them. That's why non-African modern humans have some Neandertal DNA. But Africans don't have that DNA. So why is that?

So the question is, why don't modern Africans have Neandertal DNA? Let's think about the possible scenarios. If modern Africans don't have Neandertal DNA, that suggests that the interbreeding didn't happen in Africa. Because if it had, then their descendants would carry that DNA. So when did the interbreeding happen?

Neandertals were in Africa? Or did they migrate out of Africa? Wait, no, I think Neandertals lived in Europe and the Near East. So maybe the migration of modern humans out of Africa led them to meet Neandertals in the Middle East or elsewhere outside Africa. That would mean that any interbreeding happened after modern humans left Africa.

So if modern Africans don't have Neandertal DNA, that implies that gene flow (interbreeding) happened after modern humans had migrated out of Africa. Because if it happened in Africa, then the descendants who stayed in Africa would have that DNA. But since they don't, the interbreeding must have occurred outside Africa.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Gene flow happened before Neandertals migrated out of Africa. Wait, but Neandertals didn't really migrate out of Africa; they were already in Europe. So maybe this option isn't correct.

Option B: Gene flow occurred after modern humans migrated out of Africa. That fits with what I was thinking. Because if modern humans left Africa, and then met Neandertals outside, interbreeding happened after.

Option C: Neandertals in Africa didn't interbreed but followed modern humans out. But I don't think Neandertals were in Africa. They were in Europe and the Near East. So this option might not make sense.

Option D: Interbreeding never occurred. But I know that non-African modern humans have Neandertal DNA, so interbreeding did happen, just not in Africa.

So the correct answer should be B. Because the lack of Neandertal DNA in modern Africans suggests that any interbreeding happened after they left Africa.

The correct answer is B. Modern Africans lack Neandertal DNA because interbreeding occurred after anatomically modern humans migrated out of Africa. 

Answer: B
