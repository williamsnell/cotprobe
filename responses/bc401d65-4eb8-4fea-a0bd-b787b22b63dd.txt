Question:

A heavyset man with long red hair robbed a liquor store. Thereafter, a man was arrested and charged with the armed robbery. At the man's trial, the owner of the liquor store was called to testify. He admitted that he was unable to identify the man, who now had a shaven head, as the robber. The prosecuting attorney then handed the owner six photographs. He proposed to testify, over defense objections, that he had previously told the prosecuting attorney that picture #4, admittedly a picture of the man before he shaved his head, was a picture of the person who robbed his store. The owner's proffered testimony should be adjudged

Options:

A: admissible as a prior identification by the witness.
B: inadmissible, due to the potential for bias or suggestion.
C: admissible as past recollection recorded.
D: admissible, as it is the owner's personal account of the event.
E: inadmissible, because it is a violation of the man's right of confrontation.
F: admissible, because it is relevant to the case.
G: inadmissible, as it is based on a photograph and not a live lineup.
H: admissible, as it provides critical evidence for the case.
I: inadmissible, because the owner failed to identify the man in court.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this evidence law question. Let me read through it again and break it down.

So, the scenario is that a heavyset man with long red hair robbed a liquor store. Then, a man was arrested and charged with this robbery. At the trial, the liquor store owner is called to testify. He says he can't identify the man in court because the man now has a shaven head. The prosecuting attorney then shows him six photographs and wants the owner to testify that he previously told the prosecutor that picture #4 was the robber. The man's picture before he shaved his head is in #4.

The question is whether the owner's proffered testimony is admissible. The options are A through I.

Hmm. I remember that in evidence law, there are rules about when prior identifications can be used. For instance, if a witness can't identify someone in court because of changed appearance, they might be allowed to make a prior identification from a photo lineup, but there are rules about how that can be admitted.

I think about the concept of "prior identification." If a witness identifies someone out of court, that can sometimes be admitted as an exception to the hearsay rule if it's a prior identification. But there are cases, like the Federal Rules of Evidence, that might limit this.

Wait, but I also remember something about the confrontation clause. The defendant has the right to confront the witness, meaning the witness should testify based on their own perception, not hearsay. So if the owner is testifying about what he told the prosecutor before, that might be hearsay unless an exception applies.

Another point is the use of photographs. If the owner is testifying based on a prior identification from a photo, that could be admissible as a prior identification statement. But I think the key here is whether the owner is testifying about what he told the prosecutor or about his own identification.

Wait, the owner is testifying that he told the prosecutor that picture #4 was the robber. But the owner can't identify the man in court because he's shaved his head. So the owner is trying to admit that he previously identified the photo as the robber. But the problem is that the owner is testifying about his prior statement to the prosecutor, which is hearsay unless it's covered by a specific exception.

I recall that under FRE 801(d)(1)(C), a statement is not hearsay if it is offered to prove the fact stated and it was made by the witness while testifying, or was offered against an opposing party and was made by the party's agent or employee on a matter within their authority. But I don't think that applies here because the statement was made to the prosecutor, not as part of an opposing party's statement.

Alternatively, maybe it's a prior identification under FRE 901(b)(2), which allows for the use of a photograph for identification. But the issue is whether the witness can testify about their prior identification based on the photograph.

Wait, but in this case, the witness is testifying about what he told the prosecutor, not about his own identification based on the photo during testimony. So he's recounting his prior out-of-court statement, which is hearsay. Unless it's admissible as a prior identification under a hearsay exception.

I think the key exception here is whether it's an excited utterance or a statement against interest, but those don't seem to fit. Alternatively, maybe it's a statement that the witness made that is being used to refresh their recollection under Rule 612, but that's about refreshing the witness's memory, not about prior statements being admitted as evidence.

Wait, another angle: the owner is testifying that he told the prosecutor that photo #4 was the robber. But the owner can't identify the man in court. So the prosecution is trying to get in evidence that the owner previously identified the man via photo. But the owner is testifying to his prior statement, which is hearsay. Unless it's an exception.

I think the correct approach is that the prior identification by the witness is admissible as a prior identification statement, which falls under a hearsay exception. But wait, isn't there a rule against using out-of-court identifications if the in-court identification is impaired? Or is that more about lineup procedures?

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The owner can't identify the man in court because he's shaved his head. So the prosecution wants to use a prior identification from a photo. But the issue is whether the owner's testimony about telling the prosecutor that photo #4 is the robber is admissible.

If the owner is testifying about his own prior identification of the photo, then that would be allowed under the prior identification exception. But if he's testifying about what he told the prosecutor, that's hearsay unless it's an exception.

Wait, but the owner is the declarant, so if he's testifying about his own prior statement, maybe it's a statement against interest or a declaration for ID purposes. Or maybe it's allowed under Rule 801(d)(1)(A), which is a prior statement by the witness that is inconsistent with their testimony, but that's for impeachment, not for the truth of the matter.

Alternatively, maybe it's allowed under Rule 901(b)(2) as a photograph used for identification. But that rule is about the method of identification, not about hearsay.

Wait, but the owner is testifying that he told the prosecutor that photo #4 was the robber. So he's relaying his prior statement, which is hearsay, unless there's an exception. One possible exception is the statement is being offered to show that the owner identified the defendant as the robber, not for the truth of the matter. Wait, no, that's not right. The truth is what matters here.

Alternatively, maybe the prior identification is admissible as a prior consistent statement under Rule 801(d)(1)(B), but that's for statements that rebut a charge of recent fabrication. Not sure that applies here.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Another approach: the defense is probably arguing that this is inadmissible because it's hearsay. The prosecution is trying to get the owner to testify about his prior identification, which would be a prior statement, but without a hearsay exception, it's inadmissible.

But in some cases, prior identifications are admissible. For example, under the Federal Rules, prior photo identifications can be admitted if the witness testifies based on their own identification at the time. But if the witness is testifying about what they told someone else, that's hearsay.

Wait, maybe the problem is that the owner is testifying about his prior statement to the prosecutor, which is hearsay, but it's being offered for the truth, so unless an exception applies, it's inadmissible.

Alternatively, perhaps it's being offered to show the owner's belief, not as substantive evidence. But no, the prosecution wants it as evidence that the man is the robber.

Wait, another angle: the owner's prior identification is being used to prove the man's guilt, so it's substantive evidence, hence hearsay unless an exception applies.

So, in this case, the owner is testifying about his prior statement to the prosecutor. That's hearsay. Is there an exception? Maybe the statement is admissible as a prior identification under FRE 801(d)(1)(C), but that rule applies when the statement is offered against a party and was made by the party's agent. The prosecutor is the government, so if the statement was made to the prosecutor, who is the government, then maybe it's admissible under 801(d)(1)(C) as a prior statement by the government's agent.

Wait, but the owner is not the government's agent. He's a witness. So that rule doesn't apply here.

Alternatively, maybe it's admissible under the "declaration for identification" exception. I think there's a rule that allows for prior identifications to be admitted as substantive evidence. Like, if a witness identifies a photo as the defendant, that can be admitted.

Wait, but I'm mixing up the rules. Under FRE 901(b)(2), a photograph is admissible for identification if it's identified by a witness. So if the owner can identify the photo as the robber, it's admissible. But in this case, the owner is testifying that he told the prosecutor that photo #4 was the robber. That's different from the owner identifying the photo in court.

Wait, perhaps the owner is testifying that he identified the photo at the time, so he can testify about that identification. But if he can't identify the man in court, he can use the photo to make the identification now, but he's testifying about his prior statement to the prosecutor.

Wait, maybe the correct approach is that the owner's prior identification of the photo is admissible as a prior identification, making it admissible under a hearsay exception. So the answer would be A: admissible as a prior identification by the witness.

But I'm not entirely sure. Another thought: the defense might argue that this is inadmissible because it's based on a photograph, not a live lineup, but I don't think that's a bar. Prior photo identifications are generally allowed.

Alternatively, the problem might be that the owner is testifying about his prior statement to the prosecutor, which could be seen as hearsay. But if the prior statement is being used to establish the fact that the photo was the robber, and the owner can't identify the man in court, then maybe it's allowed as a prior identification.

Wait, maybe the problem is that the owner is testifying about his prior statement, which is hearsay, but as a prior identification, it's admissible under a hearsay exception. So the answer would be A.

Alternatively, some might argue that it's inadmissible because it's based on a photograph, not a live lineup, but I think that's not the case. The method of identification (photo vs. lineup) doesn't make it inadmissible; it's about whether the identification is reliable.

Wait, but the issue is whether the owner's prior statement is hearsay and whether an exception applies. Since the owner is the declarant and is testifying, maybe it's not hearsay because it's not being offered for the truth of the matter asserted, but that doesn't make sense because the prosecution is trying to prove the man is the robber.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to summarize:

- Owner can't identify man in court due to shaven head.

- Prosecutor shows him six photos, including #4, which is the man before shaving.

- Owner testifies that he told the prosecutor that #4 was the robber.

- The question is whether this testimony is admissible.

The key issue is whether the owner's prior statement is hearsay and whether an exception applies.

If it's a prior identification, then under some rules, it's admissible. For example, under FRE 801(d)(1)(C), a statement is not hearsay if it's offered against an opposing party and was made by the party's agent or employee on a matter within their authority. But the owner isn't the government's agent; he's a witness. So that exception doesn't apply.

Alternatively, maybe it's admissible under the prior consistent statement exception under 801(d)(1)(B), but that requires the statement to be offered to rebut a charge of recent fabrication, which isn't the case here.

So perhaps the only way it's admissible is if it's a prior identification by the witness, which falls under a hearsay exception. But I'm not sure which exception that would be.

Wait, another thought: the owner's prior identification could be admissible as a statement against penal interest under FRE 804(b)(3), but that requires the declarant to be unavailable, which isn't the case here.

Alternatively, maybe it's allowed under the residual exception, but that's a high bar.

Wait, maybe the correct approach is that the prior identification is admissible as a prior identification by the witness, making it admissible as non-hearsay under some rule.

Alternatively, perhaps the testimony is inadmissible because it's based on a photograph and not a live lineup, but I don't think that's the case. The method of identification doesn't inherently make it inadmissible; it's about whether the identification is reliable.

But the problem is that the owner is testifying about his prior statement, which is hearsay. So unless there's an exception, it's inadmissible.

Wait, but in some jurisdictions, prior photo identifications are admissible as an exception to hearsay. For example, under some state rules or federal rules, a prior photo identification can be admitted as substantive evidence.

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the owner's identification of the photo is being offered as a prior identification, which is admissible under the prior identification exception.

Wait, I think the correct answer is that the testimony is inadmissible because it's a prior out-of-court statement offered for the truth, which is hearsay without an exception. So the correct answer would be B: inadmissible due to potential for bias or suggestion.

Wait, but why potential for bias or suggestion? Maybe because the owner was shown the photo by the prosecutor, which could have influenced his identification, making it suggestible.

Alternatively, perhaps the issue is that the owner is testifying about his prior statement, which could be influenced by the prosecutor's actions, leading to potential bias.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Another angle: the owner's inability to identify in court might make the prior identification less reliable, but that goes to weight, not admissibility.

Alternatively, the problem might be that the owner is testifying about what he told the prosecutor, which is hearsay, and without an exception, it's inadmissible.

So, looking at the options:

A: admissible as a prior identification by the witness.

B: inadmissible, due to the potential for bias or suggestion.

C: admissible as past recollection recorded.

D: admissible, as it is the owner's personal account of the event.

E: inadmissible, because it is a violation of the man's right of confrontation.

F: admissible, because it is relevant to the case.

G: inadmissible, as it is based on a photograph and not a live lineup.

H: admissible, as it provides critical evidence for the case.

I: inadmissible, because the owner failed to identify the man in court.

So, considering all this, I think the issue is hearsay. The owner's statement to the prosecutor is hearsay. Unless it's an exception, it's inadmissible.

But what exception? There's no indication that it's a statement against interest, excited utterance, etc.

Alternatively, the statement might be admissible under the prior identification exception, making A correct.

But I'm not entirely sure, but I think the more likely answer is that it's inadmissible because it's hearsay without an exception. However, looking at the options, option B says inadmissible due to potential for bias or suggestion.

Wait, another point: the owner was shown the photo by the prosecutor. This could be a situation where the prosecutor's suggestive actions influenced the owner's identification. This relates to the Due Process clause, where a suggestive identification can be excluded because it's unreliable.

In this case, the owner is testifying about his prior identification based on a photo provided by the prosecutor. If the photo lineup was conducted in a suggestive manner, the identification could be tainted, making it inadmissible.

So, under the Due Process clause, if the identification procedure was suggestive and led to a misidentification, the evidence should be excluded.

Therefore, the owner's testimony about the prior identification is inadmissible because of the potential for bias or suggestion in the identification process.

So, the answer would be B.

The question revolves around the admissibility of the liquor store owner's testimony regarding a prior identification of the defendant from a photograph. The owner was unable to identify the defendant in court due to the defendant's changed appearance (shaved head) and instead testified that he had previously identified the defendant from a photograph provided by the prosecutor. The key issue is whether this testimony is admissible under the rules of evidence.

### Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A: Admissible as a prior identification by the witness**  
   Prior identifications can sometimes be admissible, especially if they are not tainted by bias or suggestion. However, the owner's testimony about his prior statement to the prosecutor involves hearsay unless an exception applies. While prior identifications may be admissible in some cases, the potential for bias or suggestion in this scenario undermines the reliability of the identification, making this option less likely.

2. **Option B: Inadmissible, due to the potential for bias or suggestion**  
   The owner was shown the photograph by the prosecutor, which could introduce bias or suggestion into the identification process. Under the Due Process clause, identifications based on suggestive procedures can be excluded if they risk misidentification. This is the strongest argument for inadmissibility, as the method of identification (a photograph provided by the prosecutor) raises concerns about reliability.

3. **Option C: Admissible as past recollection recorded**  
   This exception applies when a witness's memory is refreshed by a recorded statement. However, the owner is not testifying based on a refreshed memory but rather recounting a prior statement to the prosecutor. This does not fit the requirements for past recollection recorded.

4. **Option D: Admissible, as it is the owner's personal account of the event**  
   While the owner's testimony is based on his personal knowledge, the issue is whether the prior statement to the prosecutor is admissible. Without an exception to the hearsay rule, this testimony would not be admissible as substantive evidence.

5. **Option E: Inadmissible, because it is a violation of the man's right of confrontation**  
   The Confrontation Clause generally applies to out-of-court statements offered for their truth. Here, the owner is testifying about his own prior statement, which does not implicate the Confrontation Clause. This option is not applicable.

6. **Option F: Admissible, because it is relevant to the case**  
   Relevance alone does not guarantee admissibility. The testimony must also meet other evidentiary standards, such as not being excluded under rules against hearsay or bias. This option does not address the specific issues with the testimony.

7. **Option G: Inadmissible, as it is based on a photograph and not a live lineup**  
   While live lineups are more reliable, prior photo identifications are generally admissible unless they are tainted by bias or suggestion. The issue here is not the method of identification but the potential for bias in the process.

8. **Option H: Admissible, as it provides critical evidence for the case**  
   While the testimony may be critical, it is not automatically admissible. The concerns about bias and suggestion outweigh the probative value of the evidence.

9. **Option I: Inadmissible, because the owner failed to identify the man in court**  
   The owner's inability to identify the defendant in court does not necessarily render the prior identification inadmissible. The issue is the reliability of the prior identification, not the owner's in-court identification.

### Conclusion:
The owner's testimony about his prior identification is inadmissible due to the potential for bias or suggestion in the identification process. The photograph was provided by the prosecutor, which could have influenced the owner's identification, making it unreliable under the Due Process clause.

**Answer: B**
