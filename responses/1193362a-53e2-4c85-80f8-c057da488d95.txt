Question:

TencerInc. has estimated its revenue function to be r(x) = 3x^2, where x is the number of years the company has been in business and r(x) is the total revenue earned up to year x in millions. The profit function is f(x) = 2x^2 - 5x +1, f(x) is the total profit earned up to year x. What is the cost accrued over a three year period? What is the rate of change of cost of production by the end of the third year?

C: $27 million, $13 million
D: $19 million, $10 million
E: $24 million, $13 million
F: $21 million, $9 million
G: $26 million, $14 million
H: $20 million, $10 million
I: $22 million, $11 million
J: $22 million, $12 million

Answer:
    
<think>
Okay, let's try to solve this problem step by step. So, we have TencerInc. with a revenue function r(x) = 3x² and a profit function f(x) = 2x² -5x +1. We need to find two things: the cost accrued over a three-year period and the rate of change of cost by the end of the third year.

First, I remember that profit is calculated as total revenue minus total cost. So, profit function f(x) = revenue r(x) - cost c(x). Therefore, I can rearrange this equation to solve for the cost function c(x).

So, starting with f(x) = r(x) - c(x), which means c(x) = r(x) - f(x). Let's plug in the given functions:

r(x) = 3x²
f(x) = 2x² -5x +1

So, c(x) = 3x² - (2x² -5x +1). Simplifying that, I subtract each term:

3x² - 2x² = x²
Then, +5x because subtracting a negative is adding
And then -1, because subtracting +1.

So, c(x) = x² +5x -1.

Wait, let me double-check that. Yes, 3x² minus 2x² is x². Then, minus (-5x) is +5x, and minus 1. So, c(x) = x² +5x -1.

Now, the first part asks for the cost accrued over a three-year period. I think that means from year 0 to year 3. So, I need to find the total cost from x=0 to x=3.

But wait, actually, the cost function c(x) is the total cost up to year x. So, the total cost over three years would be c(3) minus c(0), because c(3) is the cost up to year 3, and c(0) is the initial cost, which is at year 0.

Let me calculate c(3) first. Plugging x=3 into c(x):

c(3) = (3)² +5*(3) -1 = 9 +15 -1 = 23.

c(0) is c(0) = 0² +5*0 -1 = 0 +0 -1 = -1.

Wait, that can't be right. A cost can't be negative, right? Hmm, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check the profit function again. f(x) is the total profit up to year x. So, when x=0, f(0)=2*0 -5*0 +1 = 1 million. So, profit at year 0 is 1 million.

But since profit is revenue minus cost, at x=0, r(0)=0, so f(0)=0 - c(0) =1. So, c(0) = -1. That seems odd because cost can't be negative. Maybe the model is such that the profit function includes some initial conditions, but perhaps I should proceed.

So, the total cost over three years is c(3) - c(0) = 23 - (-1) = 24 million.

Wait, that seems high, but let's see. Alternatively, maybe the cost function is the integral of the marginal cost, but no, the problem states that f(x) is the total profit. So, yes, c(x) is x² +5x -1, so c(3) is 23, c(0) is -1, so the cost over three years is 24 million.

Next, the rate of change of cost by the end of the third year. That would be the derivative of the cost function at x=3. So, c(x) = x² +5x -1, so c'(x) = 2x +5.

Calculating c'(3) = 2*3 +5 =6 +5=11. So, the rate of change is 11 million per year.

Wait, but let me think again. The cost function is c(x)=x²+5x-1. So, the derivative is indeed 2x+5. At x=3, that's 2*3+5=11. So, the rate is 11 million per year.

Looking at the options, the first part is cost over three years, which is 24 million, and the rate is 11 million. So, looking at the options:

A: 25,12
B:23,11
C:27,13
D:19,10
E:24,13
F:21,9
G:26,14
H:20,10
I:22,11
J:22,12

Option E is 24,13. But wait, I got the rate as 11, so E's rate is 13. So, E is wrong. Then, looking for 24 and 11. Let me see: Option B is 23,11. That's the cost being 23, which I thought was 24. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the total cost.

Wait, perhaps the cost function is the integral of the marginal cost, but no, the problem says f(x) is the total profit, so c(x) is the total cost. So, c(x) = r(x) - f(x) =3x² - (2x² -5x +1) = x² +5x -1. So, that's correct.

Wait, but when x=3, c(3)= 3² +5*3 -1=9+15-1=23. Then, c(0)=0+0-1= -1. So, the cost over three years is c(3)-c(0)=23 - (-1)=24 million. So, the total cost is 24 million.

So, the first part is 24 million, and the rate of change is 11 million. Looking back at the options, E is 24,13; B is 23,11. But wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding what's being asked. The cost accrued over three years could be the total cost from year 0 to year 3, which is c(3) - c(0) =24 million. So, 24 million and 11 million would be the answer.

Looking at the options again, I don't see an option with 24 and 11. Let me check the options again:

A:25,12

B:23,11

C:27,13

D:19,10

E:24,13

F:21,9

G:26,14

H:20,10

I:22,11

J:22,12

Hmm, none of the options have 24 and 11. So, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, maybe the cost function is the derivative of the profit function? No, that's not right. Profit is total, so cost is total, not derivative.

Wait, perhaps I should model it differently. Let me think again: profit f(x) = revenue - cost, so cost = revenue - profit.

So, c(x) = r(x) - f(x) =3x² - (2x² -5x +1)=x² +5x -1.

Yes, that's correct. So c(3)=23, c(0)=-1, so total cost over three years is 24 million. The rate is 11.

Wait, but looking at the options, the only option that has 24 is E (24,13). But I have 11, not 13. So perhaps I made a mistake in the derivative.

Wait, c(x)=x² +5x -1. So, c'(x)=2x +5. At x=3, 2*3=6 +5=11. So, the rate is 11 million per year.

But none of the options have 24 and 11. So maybe I made a mistake in calculating the cost over three years. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the cost function's value at x=3, which is 23, and the rate is 11. So, that would be option B: 23,11.

Wait, but the cost accrued over three years is the total cost from year 0 to 3, which is 24 million. So, perhaps the options don't have that. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe they're asking for the cost function at x=3, which is 23, and the rate at x=3 is 11. So, that would be option B.

But the question says, "the cost accrued over a three year period." So, that would be the total cost from year 0 to year 3, which is c(3) - c(0) =24.

But in the options, E is 24 and 13. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the derivative. Let me check again.

c(x)=x² +5x -1.

c'(x)=2x +5.

At x=3, 2*3=6 +5=11. So, the rate is 11 million per year. So, the correct answer should be 24 million cost and 11 million rate, but that's not an option. So, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating c(x).

Wait, perhaps I should model the cost as the integral of the marginal cost. But no, the problem says f(x) is the total profit. So, c(x) is the total cost. So, c(x) =3x² - (2x² -5x +1)=x² +5x -1.

Wait, perhaps the cost function is actually f(x) = r(x) - c(x), so c(x)=r(x) - f(x). So, yes, that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the cost at year 3, not the total over three years. Let me re-read the question.

The question says, "What is the cost accrued over a three year period?" So, that's the total cost incurred during the three years, which is the integral of the marginal cost from 0 to 3. Alternatively, it's c(3) - c(0), which is 24 million.

But in the options, the only one with 24 is E, but its rate is 13, which I don't have. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the derivative.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the cost function is not the same as the total cost. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the cost function is c(x), and the problem asks for the total cost over three years, which would be the integral of the marginal cost from 0 to 3. But wait, c(x) is the total cost up to year x, so the total cost from 0 to 3 is c(3) - c(0) =23 - (-1)=24 million.

But the options don't have 24 and 11. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the profit function. Let me check the problem again.

Problem says: f(x)=2x² -5x +1 is the total profit earned up to year x. So, yes, c(x)=r(x)-f(x)=3x² - (2x² -5x +1)=x² +5x -1.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for an option where the cost is 24 and the rate is 11, but it's not present. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me recalculate c(3):

c(3)=3² +5*3 -1=9+15-1=23.

c(0)=0 +0 -1= -1.

So, total cost over three years is 23 - (-1)=24.

Rate is c'(3)=2*3 +5=11.

So, I think the correct answer is 24 million and 11 million, but that's not an option. So, perhaps the question is only asking for c(3), which is 23, and the rate is 11, which is option B: 23,11.

Alternatively, maybe the question is phrased to ask for the cost at year 3, not the total over three years. Let me re-read the question.

It says, "the cost accrued over a three year period." That sounds like the total cost from year 0 to 3, which is 24 million. But if that's not an option, maybe the intended answer is option E: 24,13, but I don't know why.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the derivative. Let me check again: c(x)=x² +5x -1. So, c'(x)=2x +5. At x=3, 2*3=6 +5=11. So, rate is 11.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the cost function is the derivative of the profit function. No, that can't be because profit is total, not marginal.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the cost function is f(x) =2x² -5x +1, but that's the profit function. No, no, the profit function is given, so cost is derived from that.

I think I've made a mistake in assuming that the total cost over three years is c(3) - c(0). Maybe the question is simply asking for c(3), which is 23 million, and the rate is 11 million, which would be option B.

But I'm confused because the question says "over a three-year period," which implies the total, which would be 24 million. But since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is B:23,11.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the marginal cost at x=3, which is 11 million, and the total cost at x=3 is 23 million.

Therefore, the answer would be option B:23 million, 11 million.
</think>

To determine the cost accrued over a three-year period and the rate of change of cost by the end of the third year, we start by defining the cost function. The profit function is given as \( f(x) = 2x^2 - 5x + 1 \), and the revenue function is \( r(x) = 3x^2 \). Since profit is revenue minus cost, we can express the cost function as:

\[
c(x) = r(x) - f(x) = 3x^2 - (2x^2 - 5x + 1) = x^2 + 5x - 1
\]

### Cost Accrued Over Three Years
The total cost accrued over a three-year period is the difference between the cost at year 3 (\( c(3) \)) and the initial cost at year 0 (\( c(0) \)):

\[
c(3) = 3^2 + 5(3) - 1 = 9 + 15 - 1 = 23 \, \text{million}
\]
\[
c(0) = 0^2 + 5(0) - 1 = -1 \, \text{million}
\]
\[
\text{Total cost} = c(3) - c(0) = 23 - (-1) = 24 \, \text{million}
\]

### Rate of Change of Cost by the End of the Third Year
The rate of change of cost is the derivative of the cost function:

\[
c'(x) = \frac{d}{dx}(x^2 + 5x - 1) = 2x + 5
\]
\[
c'(3) = 2(3) + 5 = 6 + 5 = 11 \, \text{million per year}
\]

### Conclusion
The cost accrued over three years is **24 million**, and the rate of change of cost by the end of the third year is **11 million per year**. However, none of the provided options match these values. The closest option is **B: 23 million, 11 million**, which likely interprets the cost at year 3 as the accrued cost.
