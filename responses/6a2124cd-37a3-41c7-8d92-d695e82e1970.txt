Answer:
    
<think>
Okay, so I've got this problem here about calculating the change in enthalpy, ΔH, when 2 moles of copper are heated from 50°C to 200°C. The given values are a = 5.41 cal/mol·K and b = 1.50 cal/mol·K². Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my thermodynamics, but let's try to work through this step by step.

First, I remember that enthalpy change for a process involving temperature change can be calculated using the formula ΔH = n * C * ΔT, where C is the heat capacity and n is the number of moles. But wait, in this case, the problem gives me two constants, a and b. Oh right, sometimes materials have a heat capacity that's not constant with temperature. So maybe the heat capacity here is temperature-dependent and given by some function involving a and b.

I think the formula for the heat capacity when it varies with temperature might be something like C(T) = a + b*T. That makes sense because a and b are constants with units of cal/(mol·K) and cal/(mol·K²), respectively. So when you multiply b by T (in Kelvin), it gives units of cal/(mol·K), matching a's units. Then adding them together gives the total heat capacity at each temperature.

So the next step is to integrate the heat capacity over the temperature change because the heat capacity is changing with temperature. The formula for ΔH would be the integral from T1 to T2 of n * C(T) dT. Let me write that out:

ΔH = n * ∫(from T1 to T2) [a + b*T] dT

Breaking that integral into two parts:

ΔH = n * [a*(T2 - T1) + (b/2)*(T2² - T1²)]

Wait, let me make sure about the integral. The integral of a is a*T, and the integral of b*T is (b/2)*T². So yes, that looks right.

Now, plugging in the values. But wait, the temperatures are given in Celsius. Oh right, because the change in temperature is the same in Celsius and Kelvin. So ΔT is 200°C - 50°C = 150°C, which is 150 K. So T1 is 50°C and T2 is 200°C, but since we're dealing with the difference, we can use these values as is for ΔT, but when squaring T, we should convert to Kelvin.

Wait, no, actually, when integrating, the exact temperature values in Kelvin matter because they're squared. So let's convert T1 and T2 to Kelvin. T1 = 50 + 273.15 = 323.15 K, and T2 = 200 + 273.15 = 473.15 K.

So plugging in:

a = 5.41 cal/(mol·K)
b = 1.50 cal/(mol·K²)
n = 2 moles
ΔT = T2 - T1 = 150 K

Compute each part:

First part: a*(T2 - T1) = 5.41 * 150 = let's calculate that. 5 *150 is 750, 0.41*150 is 61.5, so total is 750+61.5=811.5 cal/mol.

Second part: (b/2)*(T2² - T1²) = (1.50/2) * (473.15² - 323.15²). Let's compute that.

First, 1.50/2 = 0.75 cal/(mol·K²).

Now, compute T2² and T1².

473.15² = let's approximate. 470² is 220900, 3.15² is about 9.92, and the cross term is 2*470*3.15= around 2*470*3=2820, so adding up: 220900 + 2820 +9.92 ≈ 223729.92.

Wait, maybe a better way is to compute it exactly. 473.15 *473.15. Hmm, alternatively, perhaps using the difference of squares formula: T2² - T1² = (T2 - T1)(T2 + T1). That might be easier.

So T2 + T1 = 473.15 + 323.15 = 796.3 K. And T2 - T1 is 150 K, as before. So (T2² - T1²) = 150 * 796.3 = 150 * 796.3.

Calculating that: 150 * 700 = 105,000; 150 *96.3=14,445. So total is 105,000 +14,445 = 119,445 K².

So the second part is 0.75 * 119,445 = let's compute that. 0.75 is 3/4, so 119,445 * 3/4. 119,445 /4 = 29,861.25. Multiply by 3: 89,583.75 cal/mol.

So now, add the two parts together:

First part: 811.5 cal/mol
Second part: 89,583.75 cal/mol
Total for each mole: 811.5 + 89,583.75 = 90,395.25 cal/mol.

Now multiply by the number of moles, n=2:

ΔH = 90,395.25 * 2 = 180,790.5 cal.

Wait, but the options are in Joules. Oh right, I need to convert calories to Joules. I remember that 1 cal = 4.184 J. So:

180,790.5 cal * 4.184 J/cal ≈ let's compute that.

First, approximate 180,790.5 *4 = 723,162 J. Then 180,790.5 *0.184 = ?

180,790.5 *0.1 = 18,079.05
180,790.5 *0.08 = 14,463.24
180,790.5 *0.004 = 723.162

Adding those: 18,079.05 +14,463.24 = 32,542.29 +723.162 ≈33,265.45 J.

So total is approximately 723,162 +33,265.45 = 756,427.45 J. Wait, that can't be right because looking at the options, the highest is 9000 J. Oh wait, wait, wait, I think I made a mistake in the units somewhere.

Wait a second, perhaps I messed up the calculation. Let me go back. Oh no, wait, the calculation for the second part is 0.75 * (150 * 796.3) = 0.75 * 119,445 = let's compute that again.

Wait, 119,445 * 0.75. Let's compute 119,445 * 0.7 = 83,611.5, and 119,445 * 0.05=5,972.25. Adding them gives 83,611.5 +5,972.25=89,583.75 cal/mol. That's correct.

Then, adding to the first part: 811.5 +89,583.75 =90,395.25 cal/mol. Then, times 2 moles: 180,790.5 cal.

Wait, but that's way higher than the options given. The options are all around 5,000 to 9,000 J. So I must have made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses degrees Celsius but doesn't require converting to Kelvin for the integration? But no, because when you square Celsius temperatures, it's not the same as Kelvin. Alternatively, maybe the formula is different. Alternatively, perhaps the heat capacity is given as C = a + b*T, and T is in Celsius. Let me try that approach.

Wait, but using T in Celsius would be incorrect because temperature in physics equations should be absolute. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different formula. Wait, maybe the equation is to compute the average heat capacity over the temperature range and then multiply by the temperature change.

So average C would be (C_initial + C_final)/2. C_initial is at T1=50°C, so C_initial = a + b*T1 =5.41 +1.50*50 =5.41 +75=80.41 cal/(mol·K). C_final at T2=200°C is 5.41 +1.50*200=5.41+300=305.41 cal/(mol·K). The average C is (80.41 +305.41)/2 = (385.82)/2=192.91 cal/(mol·K).

Then ΔH = n * average C * ΔT. So n=2, average C=192.91, ΔT=150°C.

So ΔH = 2 *192.91 *150 = let's compute that. 192.91 *150=28,936.5 cal. Then times 2: 57,873 cal.

Convert to J: 57,873 *4.184 ≈ 57,873 *4 =231,492, plus 57,873 *0.184≈10,678. So total ≈242,170 J. That's still way higher than the options given, which are around 5,000-9,000 J. So this approach isn't matching either.

Hmm, maybe I messed up the integration approach. Let me recheck the integration.

Wait, the integral is ∫(a + b*T) dT from T1 to T2. So the integral is a*(T2-T1) + (b/2)*(T2² - T1²). So that's correct.

But perhaps I made an error in the calculation of T2² - T1². Let me recalculate T2 and T1 in Kelvin.

T1 = 50°C = 323.15 K
T2 = 200°C =473.15 K

Compute T2²: 473.15^2. Let me calculate 473^2: 473 *473. Let's compute 400²=160000, 70²=4900, 3²=9. Cross terms: 2*(400*70)=56,000, 2*(400*3)=2,400, 2*(70*3)=420. So 160000 +56,000 +2,400 +420 +4900 +9 = Wait, no, perhaps it's easier to do 473 *473.

Wait, 473 *400 =189,200
473 *70 =33,110
473 *3=1,419
Adding together: 189,200 +33,110 =222,310 +1,419=223,729.

So T2² ≈223,729 K².

T1² =323.15^2. Let's do 323^2: 300²=90,000, 23²=529, cross term 2*300*23=13,800. So 90,000 +13,800=103,800 +529=104,329.

But T1 is 323.15, so (323 +0.15)^2 =323² + 2*323*0.15 +0.15² =104,329 +96.9 +0.0225≈104,425.9225 K².

So T2² - T1² =223,729 -104,425.9225 =119,303.0775 K².

So (b/2)*(T2² - T1²) =0.75 *119,303.0775≈0.75 *119,303=89,477.3 cal/mol.

Then a*(T2-T1)=5.41 *150=811.5 cal/mol.

Total per mole:811.5 +89,477.3=90,288.8 cal/mol.

For 2 moles:90,288.8 *2=180,577.6 cal.

Convert to J:180,577.6 *4.184≈ let's compute.

First, 180,577.6 *4=722,310.4 J
180,577.6 *0.184= let's compute: 180,577.6 *0.1=18,057.76; *0.08=14,446.208; *0.004=722.3104. Adding:18,057.76 +14,446.208=32,503.968 +722.3104≈33,226.28 J.

Total J:722,310.4 +33,226.28≈755,536.68 J. That's about 755,537 J, which is 755.5 kJ. But the options are all in the range of 5,000 to 9,000 J. So clearly, I've made a mistake somewhere.

Wait a minute, perhaps the formula is different. Maybe the heat capacity is given as C = a + b*T, but in the problem, 'a' and 'b' are in cal/(mol·K) and cal/(mol·K²), so perhaps the formula is correct. But the result I'm getting is way too high compared to the options.

Wait, perhaps the units were incorrectly converted. Let me check the units again. Oh wait, the problem gives a as 5.41 cal/(mol·K) and b as 1.50 cal/(mol·K²). So when I integrate a +b*T over K, the units work out because T is in K. So that's correct.

Wait, but maybe the problem is using ΔH in calories, not converting to Joules yet. Let me check the options: they are in J, so I must convert.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me try a different approach, maybe using the formula for the integral again.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the average value of the heat capacity over the temperature range. So average C = (C_initial + C_final)/2. C_initial is at T=50°C, so a + b*T =5.41 +1.50*50=5.41 +75=80.41 cal/(mol·K). C_final at 200°C is 5.41 +1.50*200=305.41 cal/(mol·K). Average C=(80.41 +305.41)/2=192.91 cal/(mol·K).

Then ΔH = n * average C * ΔT =2 *192.91 *150=2*192.91=385.82 *150=57,873 cal. Then convert to J:57,873 *4.184 ≈57,873 *4=231,492 +57,873 *0.184≈10,678 → total≈242,170 J. Still way higher than the options.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses a different formula, such as using the temperature in Celsius without converting to Kelvin. Let me try that.

So T1=50°C, T2=200°C. So ΔT=150°C.

Compute T2² - T1² with T in Celsius: (200)^2 -50^2=40,000 -2,500=37,500 (C²).

So (b/2)*(T2² - T1²)=0.75 *37,500=28,125 cal/mol.

Then a*(ΔT)=5.41 *150=811.5 cal/mol.

Total per mole:811.5 +28,125=28,936.5 cal/mol.

For 2 moles:57,873 cal.

Convert to J:57,873 *4.184 ≈57,873 *4=231,492 +57,873 *0.184≈10,678 → total≈242,170 J. Still way too high.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me see the options again. The options are up to 9000 J, which is about 9,000 J. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check again.

Wait, perhaps I forgot to multiply by n, but no, I did that. Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different approach, like C = a + b*T, but only uses the initial temperature or final temperature. Let me try using the initial temperature.

Compute C_initial =5.41 +1.50*50=80.41 cal/(mol·K).

Then ΔH =n*C_initial*ΔT =2 *80.41 *150=2*80.41=160.82 *150=24,123 cal. Convert to J:24,123 *4.184≈24,123 *4=96,492 +24,123 *0.184≈4,431 → total≈100,923 J. Still too high.

Alternatively, using the final temperature: C_final=305.41 cal/(mol·K).

ΔH=2 *305.41 *150=610.82 *150=91,623 cal → 91,623 *4.184≈382,100 J. Still way too high.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using only a, the constant term, and ignoring b. Let me try that.

ΔH =n *a *ΔT =2 *5.41 *150=5.41 *300=1,623 cal →1,623 *4.184≈6,773 J. Hmm, that's close to option I (7,540 J) and option J (6,800 J). Wait, 6,773 is closer to option J (6,800 J), but let's see if that's the case.

But the problem gives both a and b, so probably shouldn't ignore b. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the formula without considering the temperature dependence, but that would be odd.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the unit conversion. Let me check: 1 cal =4.184 J. So 180,577.6 cal *4.184 J/cal = let's compute:

180,577.6 *4 =722,310.4 J

180,577.6 *0.184 = let's compute:

0.1 *180,577.6 =18,057.76

0.08 *180,577.6 =14,446.208

0.004 *180,577.6 =722.3104

Adding these:18,057.76 +14,446.208=32,503.968 +722.3104=33,226.2784 J.

Total J:722,310.4 +33,226.2784≈755,536.68 J.

Wait, but that's way beyond the options given. So I must have made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the formula is different. Maybe the problem is using the formula ΔH = n [a(T2 - T1) + b(T2² - T1²)], but without the 1/2 factor. Because in my calculation, the integral of T dT is (T²/2), but perhaps the problem isn't accounting for that, and just uses T squared as is.

So if I drop the 1/2 factor, then:

(b)*(T2² - T1²) =1.50 * (473.15² -323.15²) =1.50*(223,729 -104,425.9225)=1.50*(119,303.0775)=178,954.616 cal/mol.

Adding a*(ΔT)=5.41*150=811.5 cal/mol.

Total per mole:811.5 +178,954.616=179,766.116 cal/mol.

For 2 moles:359,532.232 cal.

Convert to J:359,532.232 *4.184≈359,532 *4=1,438,128 +359,532 *0.184≈66,300 → total≈1,504,428 J. Still way too high.

Hmm, this is perplexing. Maybe I should look for another approach. Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the formula ΔH =n [a (T2 - T1) + b (T2² - T1²)] × 0.5? Wait, no, that's what I did earlier.

Wait, perhaps the problem's a and b are in different units. Let me recheck the units given: a is 5.41 cal/(mol·K), and b is 1.50 cal/(mol·K²). So when I multiply b by T² (in K²), it gives cal/(mol). So the units are correct.

Wait, maybe the problem expects me to calculate the change in enthalpy using the formula ΔH =nCpΔT, where Cp is the heat capacity at constant pressure. But if Cp is given by a +bT, then the integral approach is correct. But why are the results so high compared to the options?

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the answer in cal, not J. Let me see. If I calculate 180,577.6 cal, that's about 180,578 cal. The options are in J, so that's about 755,536 J, which isn't an option. The highest option is A:9000 J, which is way lower.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the integral. Let me compute the integral again.

Compute a*(T2 - T1) =5.41 * (473.15 -323.15)=5.41 *150=811.5 cal/mol.

Compute (b/2)*(T2² - T1²) =0.75*(473.15² -323.15²)=0.75*(223,729 -104,425.9225)=0.75*(119,303.0775)=89,477.308 cal/mol.

Adding:811.5 +89,477.308=90,288.808 cal/mol.

For 2 moles:180,577.616 cal.

Convert to J:180,577.616 *4.184 ≈ let me compute this accurately.

180,577.616 *4 =722,310.464

180,577.616 *0.184 = let's compute:

0.1 *180,577.616 =18,057.7616

0.08 *180,577.616 =14,446.20928

0.004 *180,577.616 =722.310464

Adding those:18,057.7616 +14,446.20928=32,503.97088 +722.310464=33,226.28134 J.

Total J:722,310.464 +33,226.28134=755,536.745 J. Still way too high.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to use the temperature in Celsius for the integral. Let me try that.

T1=50°C, T2=200°C.

Compute a*(T2-T1)=5.41 *150=811.5 cal/mol.

Compute (b/2)*(T2² - T1²)=0.75*(200² -50²)=0.75*(40,000 -2,500)=0.75*37,500=28,125 cal/mol.

Total per mole:811.5 +28,125=28,936.5 cal/mol.

For 2 moles:57,873 cal.

Convert to J:57,873 *4.184≈57,873 *4=231,492 +57,873 *0.184≈10,678 → total≈242,170 J. Still higher than options.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses a different approach, such as Cp = a + b*T, but only uses the average T. Let me try that.

Average T=(50+200)/2=125°C=398.15 K.

Cp=5.41 +1.50*398.15=5.41 +597.225=602.635 cal/(mol·K).

Then ΔH= n * Cp * ΔT =2 *602.635 *150=2*602.635=1,205.27 *150=180,790.5 cal →755,537 J. Still no match.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using Cp = a + b*T, but with T in Celsius. So average T=125°C.

Cp=5.41 +1.50*125=5.41 +187.5=192.91 cal/(mol·K).

ΔH=2 *192.91 *150=57,873 cal →242,170 J. Still no match.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the specific heat at constant volume instead of pressure, but that probably doesn't change much.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem statement. Let me recheck: 2 moles of Cu heated from 50°C to 200°C. a=5.41 cal/(mol·K), b=1.50 cal/(mol·K²).

Wait, perhaps the formula should be ΔH =n [a (T2-T1) + (b/2)(T2²-T1²)]. So that's what I did, but the result is way off.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to calculate the change in enthalpy using the formula ΔH =n [a (T2 - T1) + b (T2² - T1²)] without the 1/2 factor. Let me try that.

So (b)*(T2² - T1²)=1.50*(473.15² -323.15²)=1.50*119,303.0775≈178,954.616 cal/mol.

a*(ΔT)=5.41*150=811.5 cal/mol.

Total per mole:178,954.616 +811.5=179,766.116 cal/mol.

For 2 moles:359,532.232 cal.

Convert to J:359,532.232 *4.184≈359,532 *4=1,438,128 +359,532 *0.184≈66,300 → total≈1,504,428 J. Still way too high.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses a different exponent. Maybe the term is b*T instead of b*T². Wait, no, the integral of b*T is (b/2)*T². So unless the formula is different, I'm stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using only the a term and ignoring b. So ΔH=2 *5.41 *150=1,623 cal=6,773 J. That's close to option J:6,800 J. But the problem gives both a and b, so that seems unlikely.

Wait, maybe the problem is using only the b term. Let me see:

ΔH=2 * (1.50/2)*(150)^2=2 *0.75 *22,500=2 *16,875=33,750 cal=140,625 J. Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is ΔH= n [a (T2-T1) + b (T2 - T1)^2]. Let's try that.

So a*(150)=5.41*150=811.5.

b*(150)^2=1.50*22,500=33,750.

Total per mole:811.5 +33,750=34,561.5.

For 2 moles:69,123 cal →69,123 *4.184≈289,000 J. Still no match.

Hmm, I'm stuck. The only way to get an answer close to the options is to ignore the b term, which gives about 6,773 J, which is close to option J:6,800 J. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the integration limits or in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses the formula ΔH =n [a (T2-T1) + b (T2² - T1²)]. Without the 1/2 factor, that would give:

a*(ΔT)=5.41 *150=811.5.

b*(T2²-T1²)=1.50 *119,303.0775≈178,954.616.

Total per mole:811.5 +178,954.616=179,766.116.

For 2 moles:359,532.232 cal →359,532.232 *4.184≈1,504,428 J. No match.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to calculate the change in enthalpy using the formula ΔH =n [a (T2-T1) + (b)(T2 - T1)^2]. So let's try that.

a*ΔT=5.41*150=811.5.

b*(ΔT)^2=1.50*(150)^2=1.50*22,500=33,750.

Per mole:811.5+33,750=34,561.5.

2 moles:69,123 cal →69,123 *4.184≈289,000 J. Still no match.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the formula ΔH =n [a (T2-T1) + b (T2 - T1)]. So a=5.41, b=1.50.

ΔT=150.

So per mole:5.41*150 +1.50*150= (5.41+1.50)*150=6.91*150=1,036.5 cal/mol.

2 moles:2,073 cal →2,073 *4.184≈8,678 J. That's close to option E:8,000 J, but not exact. Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses this approach, leading to approximately 8,678 J, which isn't an option, but option E is 8,000 J.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use only the term a*(ΔT), which is 5.41*150=811.5 cal/mol →2 moles:1,623 cal →6,773 J, which is near option J:6,800 J.

But considering all this, perhaps the intended approach was to use the average heat capacity. So average C=(C_initial + C_final)/2= (80.41 +305.41)/2=192.91 cal/(mol·K).

ΔH=2 *192.91 *150=57,873 cal →57,873 *4.184≈242,170 J. Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different formula, like Cp = a + b*T, but only using the initial temperature. So Cp_initial=5.41 +1.50*50=80.41 cal/(mol·K).

ΔH=2 *80.41 *150=24,123 cal →24,123 *4.184≈100,923 J. No match.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using Cp = a +b*T, but considering that the temperature is changing from 50 to 200, and perhaps the formula is ΔH =n [a (T2-T1) + b (T2^2 - T1^2)].

Wait, but that's what I did earlier, leading to 755,536 J.

Wait, perhaps I should look for an alternative approach. Maybe the problem is actually using the formula for enthalpy change as ΔH =n [a (T2-T1) + b (T2^2 - T1^2)] but without the 1/2 factor, but I can't see how that would fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to calculate the heat capacity at the initial temperature and use that to compute the change. So Cp= a +b*T_initial.

Cp_initial=5.41 +1.50*50=80.41 cal/(mol·K).

ΔH=2 *80.41 *150=24,123 cal →24,123 *4.184≈100,923 J. No match.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula ΔH =n [a (T2-T1) + b (T2 - T1)^2]. So:

a=5.41, b=1.50, ΔT=150.

ΔH=2 [5.41*150 +1.50*(150)^2]=2 [811.5 +33,750]=2 [34,561.5]=69,123 cal →69,123 *4.184≈289,000 J. Still no match.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula ΔH =n [a (T2-T1) + b (T2 - T1)], which is a linear function. So:

ΔH=2 [5.41 +1.50] *150=2*(6.91)*150=2*1,036.5=2,073 cal →8,678 J. Closest option is E:8,000 J, but it's not exact.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to not multiply by n. Wait, no, the problem states 2 moles.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula ΔH =n a (T2-T1) + n b (T2^2 - T1^2), which is the same as what I've been doing.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the integral. Let me try computing it again.

Compute a*(T2-T1)=5.41 *150=811.5 cal/mol.

Compute (b/2)*(T2²-T1²)=0.75*(473.15² -323.15²)=0.75*(223,729 -104,425.9225)=0.75*(119,303.0775)=89,477.308 cal/mol.

Total per mole:811.5 +89,477.308=90,288.808 cal/mol.

For 2 moles:180,577.616 cal.

Convert to J:180,577.616 *4.184=755,536 J.

Wait, none of these approaches are matching the options. The only way to get an option is if I made a mistake in the initial approach, perhaps the problem is using a different formula. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula ΔH =n [a (T2-T1) + b (T2 - T1)^2].

Wait, let me try that:

a=5.41, b=1.50, ΔT=150.

ΔH=2 [5.41 *150 +1.50*(150)^2]=2 [811.5 +33,750]=2 [34,561.5]=69,123 cal →69,123 *4.184≈289,000 J. Still no match.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula ΔH =n [a (T2-T1) + b (T2 - T1) * something else]. I'm stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula ΔH =n [a (T2-T1) + b (T2 + T1)]. Let me try that.

Compute T_avg=(50+200)/2=125°C=398.15 K.

So a*(ΔT)=5.41*150=811.5.

b*(T_avg)=1.50*398.15≈597.225.

Per mole:811.5 +597.225=1,408.725.

2 moles:2,817.45 cal →2,817.45 *4.184≈11,782 J. Closest option is E:8,000 J, but not exact.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula ΔH =n [a (T2-T1) + b (T2 + T1)]. So:

a*(ΔT)=5.41*150=811.5.

b*(T2 + T1)=1.50*(200+50)=1.50*250=375.

Per mole:811.5 +375=1,186.5.

2 moles:2,373 cal →2,373 *4.184≈9,900 J. Close to option E:8,000 J and option I:7,540 J, but not exact.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula ΔH =n [a (T2-T1) + b (T2 + T1)]. So:

a=5.41, b=1.50, T2=200, T1=50.

ΔH=2 [5.41*(200-50) +1.50*(200+50)] =2 [5.41*150 +1.50*250] =2 [811.5 +375]=2 [1,186.5]=2,373 cal →2,373 *4.184≈9,900 J. Closest option is E:8,000 J, but not quite.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula ΔH =n [a (T2-T1) + b (T2^2 - T1^2)].

Wait, I think I've tried all possible approaches, and the only way to get an answer close to the options is to assume that the problem expects me to ignore the temperature dependence and use only the a term, leading to approximately 6,773 J, which is close to option J:6,800 J.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different formula, but given the time I've spent and the options provided, I think the intended answer is option I:7,540 J, which might come from a different calculation. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach and the correct answer is option I.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is using the formula ΔH =n [a (T2-T1) + b (T2 - T1)^2]. So:

a=5.41, b=1.50, ΔT=150.

ΔH=2 [5.41*150 +1.50*(150)^2]=2 [811.5 +33,750]=2 [34,561.5]=69,123 cal →69,123 *4.184≈289,000 J. Still no match.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula ΔH =n [a (T2-T1) + b (T2 + T1)]. So:

a=5.41, b=1.50, T2=200, T1=50.

ΔH=2 [5.41*150 +1.50*(200+50)] =2 [811.5 +375]=2 [1,186.5]=2,373 cal →2,373 *4.184≈9,900 J. Closest option is E:8,000 J, but not exact.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula ΔH =n [a (T2-T1) + b (T2^2 + T1^2)]. Let me try that.

Compute T2² + T1²=473.15² +323.15²=223,729 +104,425.9225=328,154.9225.

(b/2)*(T2² + T1²)=0.75 *328,154.9225≈246,116.192 cal/mol.

a*(ΔT)=5.41*150=811.5 cal/mol.

Total per mole:246,116.192 +811.5≈246,927.692 cal/mol.

For 2 moles:493,855.384 cal →493,855.384 *4.184≈2,063,000 J. Way too high.

I think I've exhausted all possible approaches. The only plausible way to get an answer matching the options is to consider that the problem expects me to ignore the temperature dependence and use only the a term, leading to approximately 6,773 J, which is closest to option J:6,800 J. Alternatively, perhaps the intended answer is option I:7,540 J, but I can't see how that would come about without a different approach.

To calculate the change in enthalpy (ΔH) when 2 moles of copper are heated from 50°C to 200°C, the heat capacity is given as a temperature-dependent function: \( C(T) = a + bT \), where \( a = 5.41 \, \text{cal/mol·K} \) and \( b = 1.50 \, \text{cal/mol·K}^2 \). The formula for ΔH is derived as:

\[
\Delta H = n \int_{T_1}^{T_2} (a + bT) \, dT = n \left[ a(T_2 - T_1) + \frac{b}{2}(T_2^2 - T_1^2) \right]
\]

### Step 1: Convert temperatures to Kelvin
\[
T_1 = 50 + 273.15 = 323.15 \, \text{K}, \quad T_2 = 200 + 273.15 = 473.15 \, \text{K}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate temperature differences
\[
\Delta T = T_2 - T_1 = 150 \, \text{K}
\]

### Step 3: Compute \( T_2^2 - T_1^2 \) using the difference of squares
\[
T_2^2 - T_1^2 = (T_2 - T_1)(T_2 + T_1) = 150 \times (473.15 + 323.15) = 150 \times 796.3 = 119,445 \, \text{K}^2
\]

### Step 4: Substitute into the ΔH formula
\[
\Delta H = 2 \left[ 5.41 \times 150 + \frac{1.50}{2} \times 119,445 \right]
\]

#### Compute each term:
1. \( a(T_2 - T_1) = 5.41 \times 150 = 811.5 \, \text{cal/mol} \)
2. \( \frac{b}{2}(T_2^2 - T_1^2) = 0.75 \times 119,445 = 89,583.75 \, \text{cal/mol} \)

#### Add the terms:
\[
\Delta H = 2 \times (811.5 + 89,583.75) = 2 \times 90,395.25 = 180,790.5 \, \text{cal}
\]

### Step 5: Convert calories to joules
\[
1 \, \text{cal} = 4.184 \, \text{J}, \quad \Delta H = 180,790.5 \times 4.184 \approx 755,536 \, \text{J}
\]

### Step 6: Analyze the discrepancy
The calculated value of \( 755,536 \, \text{J} \) is significantly higher than the provided options, which range from \( 5,000 \, \text{J} \) to \( 9,000 \, \text{J} \). This suggests a potential misunderstanding of the problem's intended approach. If the temperature dependence of the heat capacity is ignored, and only the constant term \( a \) is used:

\[
\Delta H = n \cdot a \cdot \Delta T = 2 \cdot 5.41 \cdot 150 = 1,623 \, \text{cal} = 6,773 \, \text{J}
\]

This value is closest to **option J: 6,800 J**.

### Final Answer:
J
