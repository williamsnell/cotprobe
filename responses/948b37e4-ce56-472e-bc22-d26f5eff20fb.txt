Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the gravitational acceleration experienced by the Space Shuttle when it's orbiting 300 km above Earth's surface. Hmm, let me think about what I remember from physics class. 

I know that the gravitational acceleration decreases with the square of the distance from the center of the Earth. The formula should be something like g = G*M / r², where G is the gravitational constant, M is Earth's mass, and r is the distance from Earth's center.

Wait, the problem gives Earth's radius as 6,400 km. So the Space Shuttle is 300 km above that. Let me add those together to get the total distance from Earth's center. 6,400 + 300 equals 6,700 km. Oh, but I need to convert that to meters because the standard units for these constants are in meters. So that's 6,700,000 meters or 6.7 x 10^6 m.

I remember that the gravitational acceleration at Earth's surface is about 9.8 m/s². But since the Space Shuttle is above the surface, the acceleration should be less. So I'm expecting an answer less than 9.8 m/s².

Let me recall the formula. The gravitational acceleration decreases with the square of the distance. So if the radius increases by a factor, the acceleration decreases by the square of that factor. Alternatively, I can think of it as (Earth's radius / new radius) squared multiplied by the surface gravity.

Wait, Earth's radius is 6,400 km, and the new radius is 6,700 km. So the ratio is 6,400 / 6,700. Let me calculate that. 6400 divided by 6700. Let me approximate: 6400 ÷ 6700 ≈ 0.9552. So the square of that is approximately (0.9552)^2. Let me compute that. 0.9552 * 0.9552. Hmm, 0.9 squared is 0.81, 0.95 squared is 0.9025. So 0.9552 squared would be a little higher than 0.91, maybe around 0.9125.

So surface gravity is 9.8 m/s². Multiply by 0.9125: 9.8 * 0.9125. Let me compute that. 9.8 * 0.9 = 8.82, 9.8 * 0.0125=0.1225. So 8.82 + 0.1225 = 8.9425 m/s². Wait, but that's higher than the surface gravity, which can't be right because the shuttle is above the surface. Oh wait, no, wait: because the new radius is larger, the acceleration should be less, so I think I might have messed up the ratio. Let me double-check.

Wait, the formula is (r_earth / r_total) squared times g_earth. Oh right! Because the acceleration is proportional to 1/r². So if r increases, the acceleration decreases. So the ratio is (r_earth / (r_earth + height)) squared.

So r_earth is 6400 km, height is 300 km. So r_total is 6700 km. So ratio is 6400/6700 = 0.9552. Square that, which is approximately 0.9125. So g = 9.8 * 0.9125 ≈ 8.94 m/s². Wait, but that's about 8.9, which is higher than Earth's surface gravity. That doesn't make sense. Oh wait, no, because 0.9125 is less than 1, so 9.8 * 0.9125 should be less than 9.8. Let me recalculate: 9.8 * 0.9125.

9.8 * 0.9 is 8.82, 9.8 * 0.0125 is 0.1225. So total is 8.82 + 0.1225 = 8.9425 m/s². Wait, that's about 8.94, which is less than 9.8, which makes sense. So the gravitational acceleration at that height is approximately 8.9 m/s².

Wait, but wait a second. I've heard that the Space Shuttle's orbit is in a region where the gravitational acceleration is around 8.7 to 8.9 m/s², which is a bit less than Earth's surface. So that's consistent.

Looking at the options, option F is 8.9 m/s², which matches my calculation. But let me check if I did the ratio correctly. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute it using the formula more precisely.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the exact formula. Let me try that.

g = G*M / r²

But I don't remember the exact values of G and M. But I know that at Earth's surface, g is 9.8 m/s², and r is 6,400,000 meters. So when I go to 6,700,000 meters, I can compute the ratio.

Alternatively, another approach: the ratio of the accelerations is (r1 / r2)^2. Since at Earth's surface, r1 = 6.4e6 m, and r2 = 6.7e6 m.

So acceleration at height h is g' = g * (r1 / r2)^2.

So g = 9.8, r1=6.4e6, r2=6.7e6.

So (6.4 / 6.7)^2 = ?

6.4 / 6.7 ≈ 0.9552, as before. Squared is ~0.9125.

So 9.8 * 0.9125 ≈ 8.94 m/s². So that's approximately 8.9 m/s².

Looking at the options, F is 8.9. That's one of the choices. So the answer should be F.

Wait another thing, but sometimes when I see these problems, the answer is sometimes approximated. Let me compute more precisely.

6.4 / 6.7 = let's compute it more accurately.

6.4 ÷ 6.7: Let's compute that.

6.7 into 6.4. 6.7 * 0.95 = 6.365. So 6.4 -6.365=0.035. So 0.035/6.7 ≈ 0.00522. So total is 0.95 + 0.00522 ≈ 0.9552.

So (0.9552)^2: let's compute that accurately.

0.9552 * 0.9552:

= (0.95 + 0.0052)^2

= 0.95^2 + 2*(0.95)*(0.0052) + (0.0052)^2

= 0.9025 + 0.00998 + 0.00002704

≈ 0.9025 + 0.00998 = 0.91248 + 0.000027 → ~0.9125.

So 9.8 * 0.9125 = 9.8 * (0.9 + 0.0125)

= 9.8 *0.9 = 8.82

9.8 *0.0125 = 0.1225

Adding them: 8.82 + 0.1225 = 8.9425 m/s², which rounds to approximately 8.9 m/s². So option F.

Alternatively, could the answer be E:7.8? No, because 7.8 is lower and that's the typical value for low Earth orbit, but maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, another way: the formula is g = (G*M_e) / (r)^2.

But I can use the fact that on Earth's surface, g = 9.8 = (G*M_e)/(R_e)^2 → G*M_e = 9.8 * R_e².

So at height h, g' = 9.8 * R_e² / (R_e + h)^2.

So plugging in R_e = 6.4e6 m, h = 3e5 m (300 km). Wait, no, 300 km is 3e5 meters? Wait, 300 km is 3e5 m? No, 1 km is 1e3 m, so 300 km is 3e5 m? Wait, 300 km is 300,000 m, which is 3e5 m. So R_e + h = 6.4e6 + 3e5 = 6.7e6 m.

So R_e squared is (6.4e6)^2 = 40.96e12 m².

(R_e + h)^2 is (6.7e6)^2 = 44.89e12 m².

So g' = 9.8 * (40.96e12) / (44.89e12) = 9.8 * (40.96 / 44.89).

Compute 40.96 divided by 44.89.

40.96 / 44.89 ≈ 0.9125, same as before.

So 9.8 * 0.9125 ≈ 8.9425 m/s². So that's about 8.9 m/s², which is option F.

Wait, but wait, I've also heard that in low Earth orbit, the acceleration is around 8.7 to 8.9 m/s². So that's consistent.

So the correct answer should be F:8.9 m/s².

To determine the gravitational acceleration experienced by the Space Shuttle, we use the formula for gravitational acceleration:

\[
g' = g \cdot \left(\frac{R_{\text{Earth}}}{R_{\text{Earth}} + h}\right)^2
\]

Where:
- \( g = 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \) is the gravitational acceleration at Earth's surface.
- \( R_{\text{Earth}} = 6,400 \, \text{km} = 6,400,000 \, \text{m} \).
- \( h = 300 \, \text{km} = 300,000 \, \text{m} \).

The total distance from Earth's center is:

\[
R_{\text{total}} = R_{\text{Earth}} + h = 6,400,000 + 300,000 = 6,700,000 \, \text{m}.
\]

The ratio of the radii is:

\[
\frac{R_{\text{Earth}}}{R_{\text{total}}} = \frac{6,400,000}{6,700,000} \approx 0.9552.
\]

Squaring this ratio:

\[
\left(\frac{R_{\text{Earth}}}{R_{\text{total}}}\right)^2 \approx (0.9552)^2 \approx 0.9125.
\]

The gravitational acceleration at the Space Shuttle's altitude is:

\[
g' = 9.8 \cdot 0.9125 \approx 8.94 \, \text{m/s}^2.
\]

This value is consistent with typical gravitational accelerations in low Earth orbit, which are approximately 8.7 to 8.9 m/s². Among the given options, the closest match is **8.9 m/s²**.
