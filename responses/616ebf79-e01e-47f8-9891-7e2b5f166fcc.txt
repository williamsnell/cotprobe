Okay, so I have this question about translating the English statement "Some blue herons migrate" into predicate logic. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

First, I need to understand what the sentence means. "Some blue herons migrate" implies that there exists at least one blue heron that migrates. So it's an existential statement, meaning it's about at least one individual, not all of them.

Now, let's think about how to represent this in predicate logic. Predicate logic uses quantifiers, which can be universal (∀) or existential (∃). Since the statement is about some, not all, I should use the existential quantifier.

Next, I need to identify the predicates. Let's define:
- Hx: x is a heron.
- Bx: x is blue.
- Mx: x migrates.

The original statement is saying that there exists an x such that x is a blue heron and x migrates. So in logical terms, it's ∃x (Bx ∧ Hx ∧ Mx). Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see any that exactly match this. Hmm, maybe I can rephrase it.

Alternatively, "some blue herons migrate" can be seen as: there exists an x where if x is a blue heron, then x migrates. But that doesn't seem right because "some" is about existence, not a conditional. Alternatively, maybe it's better to think of it as the conjunction of being a blue heron and migrating.

Wait, looking at the options, let's check each one:

Option D: (∃x)[(Hx • Bx) • Mx] → This seems to be saying there's an x that is a heron, blue, and migrates. That fits because "some blue herons migrate" would mean at least one heron that is blue and migrates.

Option E: (∃x)[(Hx • Bx) ⊃ Mx] → This would mean that if x is a blue heron, then x migrates. But that's a universal statement for all x, not just some. So E seems to be incorrect because it's a conditional, not an existence of a case.

Option F: (∃x)[(Bx • Hx) ⊃ Mx] → Same as E, just the order of Bx and Hx is swapped. Still, it's a conditional and not an existence statement. So F is also incorrect.

Option D seems correct because it's stating that there's an x that is both a blue heron and migrates. So D is the conjunction of Hx, Bx, and Mx within the existential quantifier.

Wait, but another way to think about it is that the subject is blue herons, and some of them migrate. So perhaps the structure is that x is a blue heron (Bx ∧ Hx), and x migrates (Mx). So the statement is ∃x (Bx ∧ Hx ∧ Mx), which is the same as ∃x ( (Bx ∧ Hx) ∧ Mx ), which is the same as option D: (∃x)[(Hx • Bx) • Mx].

Yes, so D is the correct translation.

The correct translation of "Some blue herons migrate" into predicate logic is an existential statement indicating the existence of at least one blue heron that migrates. This corresponds to option D, which correctly uses the existential quantifier and the conjunction of the predicates for being a heron, being blue, and migrating.

Answer: D
