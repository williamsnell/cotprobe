Alright, so I've got this multiple-choice question here, and I need to figure out which statement isn't true. Let's break it down step by step. The question is asking which of the options A through D is not true. The options are about various foods and their nutrient content, specifically proteins and amino acids.

First, I'll go through each option one by one, thinking about what I know regarding nutrition and protein sources.

Option A: Vegan diets are likely to be deficient in protein. Hmm. I remember that vegans can get enough protein if they eat a variety of plant-based foods. Sources like beans, lentils, tofu, quinoa, and seitan are all good sources of protein. But I also know that some people might not get enough if they don't eat a balanced diet, relying too much on just one type of food. So, is it likely that vegan diets are deficient in protein? I'm not so sure. I think with proper planning, vegans can meet their protein needs, so maybe this statement isn't true. But I'll keep that in mind and check the others.

Option B: Cereals are deficient in lysine. Okay, lysine is an essential amino acid. I recall that cereals, like wheat, rice, and oats, tend to be low in lysine. This is because they're part of the group known as "cereal grains," which often have a lower lysine content compared to other foods. So this statement seems true. Cereals are indeed deficient in lysine, so B is probably a true statement.

Option C: Legumes are deficient in methionine. Methionine is another essential amino acid. Legumes, such as beans, lentils, and peas, are known for being high in protein but they often lack methionine. I've heard this before because when combining legumes with other foods like grains (which have more methionine), it makes a complete protein. So C seems true as well.

Option D: Dairy products are rich sources of tryptophan. Tryptophan is an essential amino acid that's a precursor to serotonin, a neurotransmitter. Dairy products, like milk, cheese, and yogurt, do contain tryptophan. I think they are considered good sources, though maybe not the highest. But compared to plant sources, dairy is definitely rich in tryptophan. So D is likely a true statement.

Now, going back to option A. If vegans eat a variety of plant proteins, they can get enough protein. So the statement that vegan diets are likely to be deficient in protein might not be true. However, some people might not get enough if they don't eat enough protein-rich plant foods. But generally, with proper planning, vegan diets can meet protein needs. So the statement in A is not necessarily true because it's possible for vegans to have adequate protein intake.

Therefore, the statement that's not true is A.

The statement that is not true is A.
