Question:

A company president is concerned about the low motivation and satisfaction of her employees and, as a result, institutes a wage and bonus (financial) incentive program for all employees. Six months later, the president finds that her efforts have not increased the employees' job motivation or satisfaction. This result is best predicted by which of the following theories?

Options:

A: ERG theory
B: Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs
C: Goal-setting Theory
D: Job Characteristics Model
E: Reinforcement Theory
F: two-factor theory
G: Self-Determination Theory
H: expectancy theory
I: Attribution Theory
J: equity theory

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the answer to this multiple-choice question about motivation theories. Let me read the question again and break it down.

The question is about a company president who noticed low employee motivation and satisfaction. She introduced a wage and bonus program, which are financial incentives. However, after six months, there was no improvement in motivation or satisfaction. The question is asking which theory best predicts this outcome.

First, I'll list the theories mentioned in the options to see which ones relate to financial incentives and their impact on motivation.

The options are:
A: ERG theory
B: Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs
C: Goal-setting Theory
D: Job Characteristics Model
E: Reinforcement Theory
F: two-factor theory
G: Self-Determination Theory
H: expectancy theory
I: Attribution Theory
J: equity theory

I remember that financial incentives are a form of extrinsic motivation. So I should think about which theories focus on extrinsic factors versus intrinsic ones.

Let me go through each theory:

A: ERG theory by Alderfer extends Maslow's theory, focusing on three core needs: existence, relatedness, and growth. While existence needs include basic needs like salary, if those are met, employees might seek higher needs. But if the program didn't work, maybe it's because higher needs weren't addressed. Not sure yet.

B: Maslow's Hierarchy says that after physiological and safety needs (like pay) are met, employees seek self-actualization. So if the president only addressed lower needs, higher needs might not be addressed, leading to no change. Possible.

C: Goal-Setting Theory is about setting clear goals to motivate. The question doesn't mention goals, just incentives, so maybe not.

D: Job Characteristics Model focuses on job design, emphasizing intrinsic factors like autonomy, skill variety, etc. If the president only changed pay, maybe she didn't affect the job's core characteristics, so no change. Possible.

E: Reinforcement Theory is about behavior being shaped by consequences. Bonuses are positive reinforcement. If it didn't work, maybe the employees didn't see the connection or the rewards weren't effective. Possible.

F: Two-factor theory ( Herzberg's) distinguishes between hygiene factors (which prevent dissatisfaction, like pay) and motivators (intrinsic job satisfaction). If pay is a hygiene factor, meeting it doesn't lead to motivation. So if the president only addressed hygiene, motivation wouldn't increase. That makes sense.

G: Self-Determination Theory focuses on intrinsic motivations: autonomy, competence, relatedness. Extrinsic rewards can sometimes reduce intrinsic motivation. So if employees were doing a job for intrinsic reasons, the bonus might not help and could even lower their satisfaction.

H: Expectancy Theory deals with people's beliefs about whether effort leads to performance and reward. If employees don't expect the bonus to improve their situation, they might not be motivated. But in this case, the president implemented the program, so maybe the employees didn't see a connection.

I: Attribution Theory is about how people explain events. If they attribute low motivation to factors they can't control, maybe the bonuses didn't change that. Not sure.

J: Equity Theory is about fairness in pay relative to others. If employees felt the bonuses were unfair, it could decrease satisfaction. But the question says the program was instituted, not how it was perceived.

Now, the president used financial incentives (hygiene factors) but didn't address the motivators. According to Herzberg's two-factor theory (option F), this wouldn't increase motivation. So the result fits this theory.

Another angle: Self-Determination Theory (G) also could explain it if employees' intrinsic needs weren't met, but the question is about financial incentives not working. Two-factor theory seems more directly related because it specifically differentiates between hygiene and motivators.

So the best answer is F: two-factor theory.

The question involves a company president who introduced a wage and bonus program to boost employee motivation and satisfaction, but the initiative failed. The best explanation for this outcome is provided by Herzberg's two-factor theory, which distinguishes between hygiene factors (extrinsic factors like pay) and motivators (intrinsic job satisfaction). Since the program addressed only hygiene factors, it did not lead to increased motivation or satisfaction. 

Answer: F
