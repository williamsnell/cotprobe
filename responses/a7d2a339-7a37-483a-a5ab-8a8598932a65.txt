Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about holidays and which one isn't attached to a specific date. The options are A through J, each representing a different holiday. I need to figure out which one doesn't have a fixed date.

Let me start by recalling each holiday and when they're celebrated. 

First, Thanksgiving. I remember that in the US, Thanksgiving is on the fourth Thursday of November every year. So it's a specific date, just not a fixed day like the 25th or something. It changes each year based on the Thursday of that week. So A is attached to a specific date, just a variable one.

Next is Memorial Day, option B. I think Memorial Day is on the last Monday of May. So it's also a specific date in the sense that it's on a particular Monday each year, so it's tied to a specific calendar placement.

Valentine's Day, option C, is on February 14th every year. That's a fixed date, so C is attached.

Independence Day, D, is on July 4th in the US. Definitely a specific date, so D is out.

New Year's Day, E, is on January 1st. That's as specific as it gets, so E is attached.

Halloween, F, is on October 31st. Fixed date, so F is out.

Easter, G, is a bit trickier. I know that Easter doesn't have a fixed date; it's based on the lunar calendar. In Western Christianity, it's the first Sunday after the Paschal full moon, which can vary. So Easter can be in March or April, and the date changes each year. That means G is the one not attached to a specific date.

Christmas, H, is on December 25th. Fixed, so H is attached.

Labor Day, I, is on the first Monday of September. So it's a specific placement, but variable each year. Still, it's tied to a specific calendar position, so I is attached.

St. Patrick's Day, J, is on March 17th. Fixed date, so J is attached.

So going through each option, the only one that doesn't have a fixed date is Easter. It varies each year based on the moon phases and the church calendar. Therefore, the answer should be G.

The answer is G.
