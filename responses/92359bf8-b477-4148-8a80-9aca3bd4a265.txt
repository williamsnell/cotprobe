Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which sexual act is prohibited in most societies. The options are A through J. Let's go through each one.

Option A: sex without consent. That sounds like rape, which is definitely illegal in most places. No consent means it's non-consensual, which is a serious crime.

Option B: sex during menstruation. I'm not sure about this. Some cultures might have taboos about it, but I don't think it's legally prohibited in most societies. It's more of a cultural or religious issue.

Option C: sex with an animal. That's called bestiality. I believe most societies have laws against this because it's considered unethical and harmful to both humans and animals.

Option D: sex in public places. Many places have laws against public indecency, so this is probably prohibited to maintain public order and decency.

Option E: sex with a minor. This is statutory rape in many jurisdictions, so it's definitely illegal to have sex with someone under the age of consent.

Option F: sex with a dead person. That's necrophilia, which is illegal in most places as it's seen as a form of abuse and not consensual.

Option G: sex for money. Prostitution is legal in some places and illegal in others. It varies, so it's not universally prohibited.

Option H: incest. Having sex with close family members is prohibited in most societies due to both legal and ethical reasons, to prevent genetic disorders and maintain family structures.

Option I: masturbation. This is a private act and generally not prohibited by law in most societies. It's more of a personal choice.

Option J: sex with a non-spouse if the person is married. This is adultery, and while it's often frowned upon, it's not always illegal. Some places have laws against it, but it's not as universally prohibited as others.

Now, the question is asking which act is prohibited in most societies. So I need to find the one that's illegal in the majority.

Looking at the options, A (non-consensual sex) is definitely illegal everywhere. E (sex with a minor) is also illegal in most places. H (incest) is prohibited in many societies. But the question is about the act that's prohibited, so perhaps the most universally prohibited.

Wait, but the question is singularâ€”what one act is prohibited. I think the most common answer would be sex without consent, which is the definition of rape. So the answer is A.

The act that is prohibited in most societies is sex without consent, as it is widely recognized as rape and illegal across the globe.

Answer: A
