Question:

This question refers to the following information.
As a Jew, I have never believed in collective guilt. Only the guilty were guilty.
Children of killers are not killers but children. I have neither the desire nor the authority to judge today's generation for the unspeakable crimes committed by the generation of Hitler.
But we may—and we must—hold it responsible, not for the past, but for the way it remembers the past. And for what it does with the memory of the past. In remembering, you will help your own people vanquish the ghosts that hover over its history. Remember: a community that does not come to terms with the dead will continue to traumatize the living.
We remember Auschwitz and all that it symbolizes because we believe that, in spite of the past and its horrors, the world is worthy of salvation; and salvation, like redemption, can be found only in memory.
Elie Wiesel, "Reflections of a Survivor," 1987

Okay, so I need to figure out what Elie Wiesel is saying about remembering the Holocaust based on the passage provided. Let me read through the passage again carefully.

The passage starts with Wiesel stating he doesn't believe in collective guilt. He's saying that just because someone's ancestor did something wrong, it doesn't make them guilty. He's emphasizing that the children of killers aren't killers themselves; they're just children. So he's clear that he's not blaming the current generation for the past actions of their ancestors.

But then he says that we must hold the current generation responsible—not for the past, but for how they remember it and what they do with that memory. He mentions that in remembering, the community can help their people vanquish the ghosts over their history. So remembering is about dealing with the past in a way that prevents ongoing trauma.

He goes on to say they remember Auschwitz because they believe the world is worth saving, and that salvation and redemption come from memory. So the act of remembering is crucial for some form of healing and ensuring the past isn't forgotten.

Looking at the options:

A: was an unnecessary burden on the German people. The passage says the opposite; Wiesel thinks remembering is necessary, so A is wrong.

B: was necessary for the German people to become reconciled to their own history. This seems to fit because he's talking about how remembering helps the community deal with their past and heal, so the German people need to reconcile with their history through memory.

C: was not necessary for the Jewish people to heal. The passage focuses on the importance of memory for healing, so this is incorrect.

D: would allow the Jews to forgive the German people. While forgiveness might be a consequence, the passage is more about the necessity of remembering for the sake of the community's healing, not specifically about forgiveness.

E: would cause more harm than good. Again, the passage doesn't suggest this; instead, it's about the benefits of remembering.

F: was only necessary for the Jewish people. No, the passage talks about the German people as well, especially in terms of how they remember.

G: would lead to a repeat of history. No, Wiesel is about preventing repeats by remembering, not causing them.

H: would ensure that it never occurred again. Similar to G, but the focus is on the present and future through memory, not on a guarantee.

I: hindered the healing process for the German people. This is the opposite of what's stated; remembering helps, so I is wrong.

J: would allow the Jews to seek revenge. The passage doesn't mention revenge; it's about healing and preventing trauma.

So, the best fit is option B: was necessary for the German people to become reconciled to their own history. Wiesel is emphasizing the importance of how the current generation remembers and deals with the past, which is crucial for reconciliation and healing.

The passage emphasizes the importance of remembering the Holocaust for the sake of healing and reconciling with history. Wiesel argues that while the current generation is not guilty for the past actions of their ancestors, they must take responsibility for how they remember and engage with that past. This process of remembering is essential for communities to address the lingering effects of trauma and prevent the repetition of such horrors. 

Option B aligns with this idea, as it highlights the necessity of remembering for the German people to reconcile with their history. The other options either misinterpret the passage or present ideas contrary to Wiesel's message.

Answer: B
