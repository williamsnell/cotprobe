Question:

The financial aid office at a state university conducts a study to determine the total student costs per semester. All students are charged $4500 for tuition. The mean cost for books is $350 with a standard deviation of $65. The mean outlay for room and board is $2800 with a standard deviation of $380. The mean personal expenditure is $675 with a standard deviation of $125. Assuming independence among categories, what is the standard deviation of the total student costs?

Options:

A: $700
B: $24
C: $405
D: $190
E: $510
F: $570
G: $320
H: $91
I: $800
J: $635

Okay, so I've got this problem about calculating the standard deviation of total student costs per semester. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow.

First, the question says that all students are charged $4500 for tuition. That's a fixed amount, so it doesn't vary. Then there are other costs: books, room and board, and personal expenditures. Each of these has a mean and a standard deviation, and they're all independent of each other.

I remember that when variables are independent, the variance of their sum is the sum of their variances. So, to find the standard deviation of the total costs, I probably need to find the variances of each variable, add them up, and then take the square root of the total.

Let me list out the given information:

- Tuition: Fixed at $4500. So, variance here is zero because there's no variability. I can ignore this for the standard deviation calculation.
- Books: Mean ($350), standard deviation ($65)
- Room and Board: Mean ($2800), standard deviation ($380)
- Personal Expenditure: Mean ($675), standard deviation ($125)

Since only the variable costs (books, room and board, and personal) have variability, I'll focus on them.

The formula I need is:

Standard Deviation of Total (σ_total) = sqrt(σ_books² + σ_room² + σ_board² + σ_personal²)

Wait, no, wait. The total cost is the sum of these four: tuition + books + room + board + personal. But since tuition is fixed, its variance is zero, so it doesn't contribute. So, I just add the variances of the other three.

So, let's compute each variance:

- σ_books² = 65² = 4225
- σ_room² = 380² = let's see, 380*380. Hmm, 300² is 90000, 80² is 6400, but wait, no, that's not the right way. 380*380: 300*300=90000, 300*80=24000, 80*300=24000, 80*80=6400. Wait, that's for (300+80)^2. So 380² is (38)^2*(10)^2 = 1444*100=144400. Oh wait, I think I confused that. 380 is 38*10, so 38² is 1444, multiplied by 100 gives 144400. So σ_room² is 144400.

Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check: 380 * 380. 38 *38=1444, so 380²=144400. Yes, that's correct.

Next, σ_personal² = 125² = 15625.

Now, sum these variances:

σ_total² = 4225 (books) + 144400 (room and board) + 15625 (personal) 

Let me add them step by step.

First, add 4225 and 144400: 4225 + 144400 = 148,625.

Then add 15625 to that: 148,625 + 15,625 = 164,250.

So σ_total² = 164,250. Now take the square root to get the standard deviation.

What's the square root of 164,250? Hmm. Let me think. 400² is 160,000. 405² is 164,025 (since 400²=160,000 and 5²=25, and cross terms 2*400*5=4000, so (400+5)^2=160,000 + 4000 +25=164,025). Oh, that's close. 405²=164,025. Our value is 164,250, which is 164,250 -164,025=225 more. So sqrt(164,250) is 405 + (225/(2*405)) approximately. But wait, 405.25 squared?

Wait, maybe exact calculation isn't necessary. Let's see: 405^2=164,025, so 164,250 is 225 more. So sqrt(164,250) = 405 + (225)/(2*405) = 405 + 225/810 ≈ 405 + 0.2778 ≈ 405.2778. So approximately 405.28.

Looking at the options, option C is $405, which is very close. So the standard deviation is approximately $405.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations because sometimes I might have made a mistake.

Wait, books' SD is 65, so variance 4225. Room and board SD 380, variance 144400. Personal SD 125, variance 15625.

Adding them up: 4225 + 144400 = 148625, plus 15625 gives 164,250. Square root is 405.277 approx, which rounds to 405. So option C is correct.

The standard deviation of the total student costs is calculated by summing the variances of books, room and board, and personal expenditures, then taking the square root. 

Books: \(65^2 = 4225\)  
Room and Board: \(380^2 = 144400\)  
Personal Expenditure: \(125^2 = 15625\)  

Total Variance: \(4225 + 144400 + 15625 = 164250\)  
Standard Deviation: \(\sqrt{164250} \approx 405.28\), which rounds to $405.

Answer: C
