Alright, so I've got this question about food security, and I need to figure out the correct answer from the options A to J. Let me start by recalling what I know about food security.

From what I remember, food security isn't just about having enough food, but more about ensuring that everyone can access it. I think the term is broader than just production; it's more about the overall system. I remember something about four pillars or components of food security.

Wait, the four components are usually availability, access, utilization, and stability. Availability means there's enough food produced or imported. Access refers to people being able to buy or get the food they need. Utilization is about how the food is used, like proper cooking to maintain nutrients. Stability would involve things like having consistent food supplies over time, not just when there's a good harvest but also during bad times.

Looking at the options, let's go through each one:

A: Ensuring food prices are controlled and affordable. That sounds a bit narrow because while price control is part of access, it's not the whole picture. Food security is more comprehensive.

B: Preventing terrorists from poisoning food. That seems more like food safety or protection from specific threats, not the overall concept of food security.

C: Components include availability, utilisation, stability, and access. This matches what I was thinking earlier about the four elements. So this could be the correct answer.

D: Development of GM crops to increase yield. While GM crops can contribute to food production, this is just one aspect of how food security might be addressed, not the definition.

E: Protecting food supplies from natural disasters. Again, this is a part of food security, specifically the stability aspect, but not the full definition.

F: Ensuring everyone's access to food. This is part of food security, but it's only one component (access) and doesn't cover availability, utilization, or stability.

G: Ending micronutrient malnutrition. That's a specific issue related to nutrition, but food security is broader than just malnutrition.

H: Producing enough food for a country's population. This is about production, which is related to availability, but again, it's just one part.

I: Protecting agricultural land. Land protection is important for production, but it's not the complete definition of food security.

So putting it all together, option C seems to cover all the necessary components of food security: availability, utilization, stability, and access. That makes sense because food security is about ensuring that food is available, accessible, used properly, and stable over time. Therefore, the correct answer should be C.

The correct answer is C, as it encompasses the four key components of food security: availability, utilisation, stability, and access.

Answer: C
