Question:

You are told that the cross-price elasticity between goods X and Y is +2.0. This means that

Options:

A: goods X and Y are independent goods.
B: goods X and Y are Giffen goods.
C: goods X and Y are luxury goods.
D: goods X and Y are substitute goods.
E: goods X and Y are Veblen goods.
F: goods X and Y are normal goods.
G: goods X and Y are inferior goods.
H: goods X and Y are perfect substitutes.
I: the demand for good X is unit elastic with respect to the price of good Y.
J: goods X and Y are complementary goods.

Okay, so I've got this economics question here about cross-price elasticity. Hmm, I remember that cross-price elasticity measures the responsiveness of the quantity demanded of one good to a change in the price of another good. The formula, if I recall correctly, is the percentage change in quantity demanded of good X divided by the percentage change in the price of good Y.

The question states that the cross-price elasticity is +2.0. Wait, so the sign here is positive. I think that's important. I remember that if the cross elasticity is positive, it means that the two goods are substitutes. Because if the price of Y goes up, the quantity demanded of X goes up too, since consumers switch from Y to X. So positive cross elasticity implies substitutes.

Let me think about the options. Option D says substitute goods, which aligns with what I just thought. But I should go through all options to be sure.

Option A: Independent goods. I think independent goods would have zero cross elasticity because changes in one's price don't affect the other. So +2.0 isn't zero, so A is out.

Option B: Giffen goods. Giffen goods are a type of inferior good where an increase in price leads to an increase in quantity demanded, but I don't think cross elasticity relates directly to Giffen here. Plus, cross elasticity being positive is about substitution, not the nature of the good itself. So B might not be right.

Option C: Luxury goods. Luxury goods are a category, but I don't think the cross elasticity directly tells us if they're luxury. Luxury goods might have elastic demand, but cross elasticity is about their relationship with another good. So C might not be correct.

Option D: Substitute goods. As I thought earlier, positive cross elasticity means substitutes. So D is a strong candidate.

Option E: Veblen goods. Veblen goods are also a type of inferior good, but similar to Giffen, their demand increases with price. Again, not directly related to cross elasticity's sign. So E is probably not the answer.

Option F: Normal goods. Normal goods have positive income elasticity. Cross elasticity is about price relationships, not income. So F doesn't fit.

Option G: Inferior goods. Inferior goods have negative income elasticity. But cross elasticity is about substitution, so G isn't directly related here.

Option H: Perfect substitutes. Perfect substitutes have a cross elasticity of exactly 1, right? Because the elasticity is unitary. But here the cross elasticity is +2.0, which is more than 1. So H isn't correct because they're not perfect substitutes; they're just substitutes with a higher elasticity.

Option I: Unit elastic with respect to Y's price. Unit elastic would mean the elasticity is exactly 1. Here it's 2.0, so I is incorrect.

Option J: Complementary goods. Complements have negative cross elasticity because if Y's price goes up, X's quantity demanded goes down. So J is wrong because the elasticity is positive, not negative.

So going through all options, D seems correct. The cross elasticity being positive and greater than one indicates that goods X and Y are substitutes. So the answer should be D.

The cross-price elasticity of +2.0 indicates that goods X and Y are substitute goods, as an increase in the price of Y leads to an increase in the quantity demanded of X. 

Answer: D
