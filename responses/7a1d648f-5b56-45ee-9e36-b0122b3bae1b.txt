Okay, so I'm trying to solve this multiple-choice question about inventory turnover and how it affects the funds tied up in inventory. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the question says that a firm's inventory turnover (IT) is 5 times on a cost of goods sold (COGS) of $800,000. Then, the IT improves to 8 times while COGS remains the same. The question is asking whether a substantial amount of funds is released from or invested in inventory, and by how much.

I remember that inventory turnover ratio is calculated as COGS divided by average inventory. So the formula is IT = COGS / Average Inventory. From this, I can rearrange it to find the average inventory: Average Inventory = COGS / IT.

So initially, when IT is 5, the average inventory would be $800,000 divided by 5. Let me calculate that: 800,000 / 5 = 160,000. So the average inventory is $160,000.

Then, the IT improves to 8. Using the same formula, the new average inventory would be 800,000 / 8. Let me do that math: 800,000 divided by 8 is 100,000. So the new average inventory is $100,000.

Wait, so the inventory was $160,000 before and now it's $100,000. That means the company has reduced the amount of inventory they're holding. So the change is 160,000 - 100,000 = 60,000. But wait, is that the amount released or invested?

Since the average inventory went down, that means they're holding less inventory, which should release funds. So the amount released would be $60,000. Let me make sure I'm not getting this backwards. If IT increases, it means inventory is turning over more quickly, so less inventory is needed to support the same COGS. So yes, the funds tied up in inventory decrease, meaning $60,000 is released.

Looking at the options, I need to find which one says $60,000 is released. Scanning through the options:

A: $200,000 released
B: $100,000 released
C: $140,000 invested
D: $160,000 released
E: $140,000 released
F: $200,000 invested
G: $60,000 invested
H: $60,000 released
I: $160,000 invested
J: $100,000 invested

So option H is $60,000 released. That matches my calculation. I think that's the correct answer.

The firm's inventory turnover improves, leading to a reduction in average inventory from $160,000 to $100,000, releasing $60,000 in funds.

Answer: H
