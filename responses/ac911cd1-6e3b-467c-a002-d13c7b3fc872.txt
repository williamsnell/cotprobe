Okay, so I've got this question about errors in measurements, and I need to figure it out. The question is asking which type of error is mainly caused by human mistakes. The options are A: gross error, B: instrumental error, C: systematic error. Hmm, let me think through this.

First, I remember that errors in experiments or measurements can come from various sources. I think there are different categories like random errors, systematic errors, and maybe something called gross errors. Let me try to recall what each of these means.

Gross errors, I believe, are pretty big mistakes that anyone can make. Like if you misread the instrument, or you recorded the wrong value by accident. Maybe even something like spilling the sample or using the wrong equipment. These are usually easy to spot because they cause significant discrepancies in the data.

Instrumental errors, on the other hand, I think are related to the tools or instruments used. If the equipment isn't calibrated properly, or it's faulty, that would fall under instrumental error. For example, if a ruler is slightly bent, or a stopwatch is slow, those would affect the measurements but not necessarily be a human mistake per se, more about the tool's condition.

Systematic errors are a bit tricky. From what I remember, these are consistent errors that affect all measurements in a particular way. They could be due to a flaw in the experimental setup or maybe an incorrect calibration that's consistent across all readings. For instance, if every time you measure the temperature, your thermometer is off by 2 degrees, that's a systematic error. These can be harder to detect because they don't vary much from one measurement to another.

Now, the question is specifically about errors caused by human mistakes. So, which category fits that best? Well, gross errors are definitely caused by humans making mistakes. They're not due to the equipment or a consistent flaw in the method. They're more like careless errors, like writing down the wrong number or misapplying a formula.

Instrumental errors, while they might sometimes be influenced by human factors in handling the equipment, are more about the instrument's condition rather than a mistake in procedure or recording. Systematic errors can sometimes be due to human error, like a consistent mistake in setup, but they are more about the systematic nature of the error across all measurements.

So, putting it together, the question is asking for the errors mainly caused by human mistakes. That points directly to gross errors because they are the result of such mistakes, like not following the correct procedure, miscalculations, or incorrect readings.

I think I've got it. The answer should be A: gross error.

The errors mainly caused by human mistakes are **gross errors**. These occur due to significant mistakes such as misreading instruments, recording incorrect values, or procedural errors.
