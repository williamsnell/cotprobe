Okay, so I have this economics question about perfectly competitive firms in the short run. Hmm, let me think. I remember that in a perfectly competitive market, each firm is a price taker, meaning they have to accept the market price. 

The question asks which statement is true. The options are A through J. Let me go through them one by one.

Option A says the firm always operates at a loss. That doesn't sound right. I think in the short run, firms can make profits, break even, or lose money depending on the price and their costs.

Option B says profits aren't affected by average total cost. That seems off. I remember that average total cost (ATC) is crucial because if the price is below ATC, the firm will shut down. So ATC definitely affects profits.

Option C claims the firm earns a normal profit. Normal profit is part of the definition of perfect competition in the long run, where firms enter until economic profits are zero. But in the short run, they can have positive or negative profits, so C might not be correct.

Option D says the firm shuts down if price is below average total cost. Wait, no, I think the shutdown condition is when price is below average variable cost (AVC), not ATC. If price is below AVC, they shut down. If it's between AVC and ATC, they might still operate to cover fixed costs.

Option E says they always shut down with any price drop. That's too extreme. They only shut down if the price falls below AVC. So E is incorrect.

Option F says they earn positive economic profit. That's possible in the short run if price is above average total cost. But not always, so F isn't necessarily true.

Option G suggests they may earn positive, negative, or normal profits. That sounds accurate. In the short run, depending on price relative to ATC, AVC, etc., they can have different outcomes.

Option H claims they always have a negative profit. No, sometimes they can make a profit, so H is wrong.

Option I says they can't earn positive profit. That's not true because if P>ATC, they do make positive profits.

Option J says profits don't depend on market conditions. That's not right; profits depend heavily on price and costs, which are market conditions.

So the correct answer must be G. It's the only option that correctly accounts for the possible outcomes in the short run.
