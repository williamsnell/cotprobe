Okay, so I've got this question about deterministic finite automata (DFA) and the minimum number of states needed to recognize a certain language L. Let me try to break this down.

The problem says that L consists of all strings over the alphabet {0,1} where two conditions are met. First, the number of 0's in the string must be divisible by k (where k is at least 2). Second, the number of 1's must be odd. I need to figure out the minimum number of states a DFA would require to recognize this language.

Hmm, I remember that DFAs are good at counting things modulo some number. So for the 0's, since they need to be divisible by k, that suggests we need to track the count of 0's modulo k. That would require k states, each representing a different remainder when the count is divided by k.

But wait, there's also the condition about the number of 1's being odd. So the DFA not only needs to track the count of 0's but also whether the count of 1's is odd or even. That sounds like another binary state: one for even and one for odd.

So combining these, the DFA needs to keep track of both the count of 0's mod k and the parity (even/odd) of the count of 1's. Since these are independent, the total number of states should be the product of the states needed for each condition. That would be k (for the 0's mod k) multiplied by 2 (for the 1's parity). So k * 2 = 2k states.

Wait, let me make sure. Each state can represent a combination of the current mod k value of 0's and the parity of 1's. So for each of the k possible remainders of 0's, there are two possibilities for the 1's: even or odd. That gives 2k distinct states. 

Let me think if there's a way to have fewer states. If the two conditions are independent, I don't see a way to combine them into a smaller number. Because the state has to capture both pieces of information simultaneously. So each state would be a pair (a, b), where a is the current mod k count of 0's, and b is whether the 1's count is even or odd.

So the transitions would work like this: when reading a '0', the a part increments by 1 mod k, and the b part remains the same. When reading a '1', the a part remains the same, and the b part flips (even becomes odd, odd becomes even).

The accepting states would be those where a is 0 (since 0's count is divisible by k) and b is 1 (since 1's count is odd). So only the state (0,1) would be an accepting state.

So the number of states in the DFA is indeed 2k. Looking at the options, that's option B: 2k.

The problem requires a DFA that tracks two independent conditions: the number of 0's modulo k and the parity of the number of 1's. Each condition contributes k and 2 states, respectively. The total number of states is the product, 2k.

Answer: B
