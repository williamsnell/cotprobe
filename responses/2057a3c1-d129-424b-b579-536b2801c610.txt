Question:

If two fruit flies, heterozygous for genes of one allelic pair, were bred together and had 200 offspring... (a) about how many would have the dominant phenotype? (b) of these offspring, some will be homozygous dominant and some heterozygous. How is it possible to establish which is which?

G: 150, inbreeding
H: 75, pedigree analysis
I: 150, test cross
J: 100, back cross

Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here about fruit flies. Let me try to work through it step by step. 

The question says that two fruit flies, both heterozygous for a particular gene, were bred together and had 200 offspring. There are two parts to the question. 

Part (a) is asking about how many of the offspring would have the dominant phenotype. I remember from my genetics class that when two heterozygotes (Aa) are crossed, it's a dihybrid cross, but wait, no, actually, this is a monohybrid cross because it's only one gene. Oh right, because each fly is heterozygous for one allelic pair, so it's Aa x Aa. 

In an Aa x Aa cross, the possible genotypes are AA, Aa, and aa. The phenotypic ratio is 3:1. So three out of four offspring show the dominant phenotype, and one out of four shows the recessive. 

So total offspring are 200. Let me calculate the number with the dominant phenotype. 3/4 of 200 is 150. So I think part (a) would have 150 offspring with the dominant phenotype. 

Moving on to part (b): among these 150, some are homozygous dominant (AA) and some are heterozygous (Aa). How can we tell which is which? 

I remember that a test cross is a way to determine the genotype of an organism with a dominant phenotype. A test cross involves breeding the organism with a recessive individual (aa). If the offspring show both dominant and recessive phenotypes, the parent was heterozygous. If all offspring are dominant, the parent was homozygous dominant. 

But wait, the question is asking how to establish which of the offspring are homozygous or heterozygous. So if we have a bunch of flies with the dominant phenotype, how to find out their genotypes. 

Another thought: if you do a self-cross, but wait, if a fly is AA, selfing won't produce any recessive. If it's Aa, selfing would give a 3:1 ratio. But maybe that's a way to test. Alternatively, a test cross is more direct. 

Looking at the options, the answers are paired. So for part (a), the options for the first number are 100, 200, 175, 150, etc. The correct number for (a) is 150, so that narrows it down to options D, F, I, J, or other options with 150. 

Now, looking at part (b), the method to distinguish homozygous dominant from heterozygous. The options paired with 150 are D, F, I, J. 

Option D is 150, reciprocal cross. Hmm. Reciprocal cross is when you swap the parents. Not sure if that directly helps in determining genotype. 

Option F: 125, back cross. Wait, back cross is a type of test cross, I think. Or maybe a back cross is with a recessive. 

Option I: 150, test cross. That sounds right because a test cross would show the difference between AA and Aa. 

Option J: 100, back cross. Wait, back cross usually refers to crossing with a parent from a previous generation, but in this context, maybe it's similar to a test cross. 

Wait, the question in part (b) is about establishing which are homozygous and heterozygous among the dominant phenotype offspring. So the method is to perform a test cross on each of them. So the correct method would be a test cross, which is option I. 

Wait, but looking at the options, option I says 150 and test cross, which would correspond to (a) 150, (b) test cross. 

So putting it together: (a) 150, (b) test cross. That would be option I. 

Wait, but let me double-check. Option I is (I: 150, test cross). So yes, that's the pair. 

Another thing to consider: the second part is about the method to determine the genotypes. So if you have a dominant phenotype fly, you can test it against a recessive (aa) to see if it produces any recessive offspring. If yes, it's Aa; if none, it's AA. 

So the correct choice should be option I: (150, test cross). So the answer is I.

The question involves two fruit flies, both heterozygous (Aa), bred together to produce 200 offspring. 

For part (a), the offspring genotypes follow a 3:1 phenotypic ratio (dominant to recessive). Thus, 3/4 of 200 offspring (150) exhibit the dominant phenotype. 

For part (b), to distinguish between homozygous dominant (AA) and heterozygous (Aa) offspring, a test cross is used. A test cross involves breeding a dominant phenotype individual with a recessive (aa). If only dominant offspring result, the individual is AA; if both dominant and recessive offspring result, the individual is Aa. 

The correct answer is I: 150, test cross.
