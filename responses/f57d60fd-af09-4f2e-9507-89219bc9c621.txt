Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a parachutist's terminal velocity. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my fluid dynamics, but let me try to work through it step by step.

Alright, the problem says the parachutist weighs 175 pounds and has a projected frontal area of 2 square feet. The drag coefficient is 0.80, and the air temperature is 70°F. I need to find his terminal velocity from the given options.

First, I remember that terminal velocity is the speed where the gravitational force equals the air resistance (drag) force. So, at terminal velocity, the net force on the parachutist is zero, meaning he stops accelerating.

The formula for drag force is (1/2) * rho * v² * Cd * A, where rho is air density, v is velocity, Cd is the drag coefficient, and A is the frontal area. The gravitational force is weight, which is mass times gravity. But wait, the weight is given as 175 lb, which is a force. So, I can set the drag force equal to the weight and solve for v.

Wait, but I need to make sure the units are consistent. The parachutist's weight is in pounds, which is a force. So, I think I should use the slug unit for mass because in the English system, F = m*a. But since weight is F = m*g, I can find mass by dividing weight by g. Wait, but in the table provided, there are two densities for each temperature: one in lbm/ft³ and another in slugs/ft³. Oh, right, because 1 slug = 32.174 lbm·ft/s², but I'm not sure if I need to convert here.

Wait, the problem gives the air density at 70°F as 0.0750 lbm/ft³ and 2.33 slugs/ft³. Hmm, maybe I should use slugs because when calculating force in the English system, mass is in slugs, and force is in pounds. So perhaps using slugs will make the units work out.

So, the parachutist's weight is 175 lb. So, his mass would be weight divided by g. Wait, but g is 32.174 ft/s². So, mass m = 175 lb / 32.174 ft/s² ≈ 5.44 slugs? Wait, wait, no. Because weight is already in pounds, which is mg, so m = weight / g. Let me check: 175 lb / 32.174 ≈ 5.44 slugs. That seems right.

Alternatively, maybe I can work with lbm. Let me think again. The density in lbm/ft³ is 0.0750 lbm/ft³ at 70°F. So, if I use lbm, I need to make sure the units are consistent. But I'm not sure about the units for velocity in the drag equation. Let me think.

The drag force equation is (0.5) * rho * v² * Cd * A. The units for rho can be lbm/ft³, but when using lbm, I might need to convert to slugs for mass because in the English system, the unit of mass is slugs. Alternatively, maybe I can use the density in slugs/ft³ directly.

Wait, the table gives two densities: one in lbm/ft³ and another in slugs/ft³. For 70°F, rho is 0.0750 lbm/ft³ and 2.33 slugs/ft³. Oh, because 1 slug is equal to 32.174 lbm, right? So, 0.0750 lbm/ft³ divided by 32.174 lbm/slug gives approximately 0.00233 slugs/ft³, but the table says 2.33 slugs/ft³. Wait, that doesn't match. Maybe I'm getting the conversion wrong. Wait, no: 1 slug = 32.174 lbm, so to convert lbm/ft³ to slugs/ft³, you divide by 32.174. So, 0.0750 lbm/ft³ divided by 32.174 is about 0.00233 slugs/ft³, but the table says 2.33 slugs/ft³. That's a big difference. Hmm, perhaps the table is using a different approach. Alternatively, maybe the rho in slugs is 0.0750 lbm/ft³ converted to slugs, but I'm confused. Let me double-check.

Wait, another approach: maybe I should just use the density in slugs/ft³ because it's provided. So, for 70°F, rho is 2.33 slugs/ft³. That would make sense because, in the English system, when you have density in slugs/ft³, and velocity in ft/s, the units for drag force would work out correctly.

So, the drag force equation is (1/2) * rho * v² * Cd * A. Let's plug in the numbers.

Terminal velocity occurs when the weight equals the drag force. So:

Weight (W) = (1/2) * rho * v² * Cd * A

We can solve for v:

v = sqrt( (2 * W) / (rho * Cd * A) )

Wait, but W is in pounds, and rho is in slugs/ft³. Let me check the units.

Density rho is in slugs/ft³.

Cd is unitless.

Frontal area A is in ft².

So, let's see: (1/2) * rho (slug/ft³) * v² (ft²/s²) * Cd (unitless) * A (ft²).

So, (slug/ft³) * ft² * ft²/s² = slug * ft²/s².

But wait, slug is the unit of mass, so mass times acceleration (ft/s²) gives force in pounds. Because F = m*a, so slug*(ft/s²) = lb.

So, the units of the drag force equation would be (slug/ft³) * ft² * ft²/s² = (slug * ft²) / (ft³) * (1/s²) ) → (slug / ft) * (1/s²).

Wait, maybe I'm getting tangled up. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to just proceed with the numbers.

Given:

W = 175 lb

rho = 2.33 slugs/ft³ (at 70°F)

Cd = 0.80

A = 2 ft²

So, plug into the equation:

v = sqrt( (2 * W) / (rho * Cd * A) )

Plugging in the numbers:

v = sqrt( (2 * 175) / (2.33 * 0.80 * 2) )

Let me compute the denominator first: 2.33 * 0.80 = 1.864, then times 2 is 3.728.

The numerator is 2 * 175 = 350.

So, 350 / 3.728 ≈ 93.92. Now, take the square root of that.

sqrt(93.92) ≈ 9.69 ft/s. Wait, that can't be right. That's way too low for terminal velocity. Parachutists don't go that slow. So, I must have made a mistake in the units.

Wait, perhaps I should have used lbm/ft³ instead of slugs. Let me try that approach again.

If I use rho = 0.0750 lbm/ft³, then I need to convert weight to mass in lbm. Wait, but the weight is 175 lb, which is a force. To find mass in lbm, I can use W = m * g, so m = W / g. But W is in lb, g is 32.174 ft/s², so m = 175 lb / 32.174 ft/s² ≈ 5.44 slugs. Wait, but I'm confused because lb is a unit of force, not mass.

Alternatively, perhaps using lbm is better. Let me think again. Let's use the density in lbm/ft³ and see.

So, using rho = 0.0750 lbm/ft³.

The formula for drag force is (1/2) * rho * v² * Cd * A, but now rho is in lbm/ft³. So, to get the force in pounds, I think I need to convert lbm to slugs because F = ma, and m is in slugs.

Wait, 1 slug = 32.174 lbm. So, rho in slugs/ft³ is 0.0750 / 32.174 ≈ 0.00233 slugs/ft³. But earlier I thought the table gives 2.33 slugs/ft³ for 70°F, but that can't be right because 0.0750 /32.174 is about 0.00233, not 2.33. Hmm, perhaps the table is correct as is, but maybe I should proceed with the rho in lbm/ft³ and convert properly.

Wait, perhaps I should use the density in slugs because the other approach gave me an unreasonably low velocity. Let me try that again.

Wait, using rho = 2.33 slugs/ft³.

W = 175 lb.

So, v = sqrt( (2 * 175) / (2.33 * 0.80 * 2) )

Calculating denominator: 2.33 * 0.8 = 1.864; 1.864 *2 = 3.728.

Numerator: 2 * 175 = 350.

350 / 3.728 ≈ 93.92.

sqrt(93.92) ≈ 9.69 ft/s. That's way too slow. Parachutists reach much higher speeds, like hundreds of mph or thousands of ft/s. So something's wrong here.

Wait, maybe I messed up the units. Let me recheck the units carefully.

In the English system, the formula for drag force is:

F_d = 0.5 * rho * v² * Cd * A

But the units of rho must be in slugs/ft³ for the force to come out in pounds.

Because:

rho (slug/ft³) * v² (ft²/s²) * Cd (unitless) * A (ft²) → (slug/ft³) * (ft²/s²) * ft² = (slug * ft²) / (ft³ * s²) ) → (slug/ft) * (ft²/s²) → (lb/s²) because slug*ft/s² = lb.

Wait, so F_d would have units of lb, which matches the weight in lb. So, the units are correct when rho is in slugs/ft³.

So, using rho = 2.33 slugs/ft³.

So, let's recompute:

v = sqrt( (2 * W) / (rho * Cd * A) )

Plugging in:

W = 175 lb

rho = 2.33 slugs/ft³

Cd = 0.8

A = 2 ft²

So:

Numerator: 2 * 175 = 350

Denominator: 2.33 * 0.8 * 2 = 2.33 * 1.6 = 3.728

So, 350 / 3.728 ≈ 93.92

v = sqrt(93.92) ≈ 9.69 ft/s.

But that's way too slow. Parachutists usually have terminal velocities around 100-200 mph, which is like 146-290 ft/s. So, clearly, I'm doing something wrong.

Wait, maybe I'm using the wrong value for rho. Let me check the table again. At 70°F, rho is 0.0750 lbm/ft³ and 2.33 slugs/ft³. Wait, that can't both be right because 0.0750 lbm/ft³ is much less than 2.33 slugs/ft³. Wait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the table. Let me think: 1 slug = 32.174 lbm, so 2.33 slugs would be 2.33 * 32.174 ≈ 75 lbm, which is way higher than 0.0750 lbm/ft³. So, this suggests that perhaps the table's second column is rho in slugs/ft³, but that would make the rho at 70°F 2.33 slugs/ft³, which is extremely high because air density is much lower. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because 2.33 slugs per cubic foot would be like a very dense medium, much denser than water. So, perhaps the table is wrong, or I'm misreading it.

Wait, looking back at the table, it says for each temperature, the density is given in lbm/ft³ and slugs/ft³. For 70°F, it's 0.0750 lbm/ft³ and 2.33 slugs/ft³. That can't be correct because 0.0750 lbm/ft³ is about 1.225 kg/m³, which is standard sea level air density. But 2.33 slugs/ft³ is way too high. Hmm. Maybe the table is actually giving the density in kg/m³ and not in slugs, but that's not what it says.

Alternatively, perhaps the table is correct, and I need to use rho in lbm/ft³ and adjust the units accordingly.

Let me try using rho = 0.0750 lbm/ft³.

In that case, I need to convert the weight (175 lb) into mass in lbm. Because F = m * a, where m is in lbm and a is in ft/s², but I think that's not the standard way. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the standard conversion where 1 slug = 32.174 lbm.

So, to convert the weight (in lb) into mass in slugs, we have W = m * g → m = W / g. So, m = 175 lb / 32.174 ft/s² ≈ 5.44 slugs.

Now, using the drag equation:

F_d = 0.5 * rho * v² * Cd * A

But F_d must equal W, which is 175 lb.

So,

175 = 0.5 * 0.0750 lbm/ft³ * v² * 0.80 * 2 ft²

Wait, but rho is in lbm/ft³, so we need to convert it to slugs/ft³. Because 1 slug = 32.174 lbm, so 0.0750 lbm/ft³ = 0.0750 / 32.174 slugs/ft³ ≈ 0.00233 slugs/ft³.

So, plug that in:

175 = 0.5 * 0.00233 slugs/ft³ * v² * 0.80 * 2 ft²

Calculating the constants:

0.5 * 0.00233 = 0.001165

0.001165 * 0.80 = 0.000932

0.000932 * 2 = 0.001864

So,

175 = 0.001864 * v²

Solving for v²:

v² = 175 / 0.001864 ≈ 93,900

v = sqrt(93,900) ≈ 306.4 ft/s.

Hmm, that's around 307 ft/s, which is about 208 mph. That seems more reasonable for a terminal velocity, especially without a parachute, but maybe with a parachute, it's lower. Wait, but the parachutist here is in free fall, so maybe without the parachute, but the options have E as 307 fps, which is 307 ft/s. So that would be the answer.

Wait, but earlier when I used rho in slugs/ft³, I got a velocity of about 9.69 ft/s, which was way too low. So, perhaps using rho in lbm/ft³ and converting to slugs is the correct approach.

Wait, let me double-check the calculations.

rho = 0.0750 lbm/ft³ = 0.0750 / 32.174 slugs/ft³ ≈ 0.00233 slugs/ft³.

Then,

v² = (2 * W) / (rho * Cd * A)

So,

v² = (2 * 175) / (0.00233 * 0.80 * 2)

Compute denominator:

0.00233 * 0.80 = 0.001864

0.001864 * 2 = 0.003728

So,

v² = 350 / 0.003728 ≈ 93,920

v ≈ sqrt(93,920) ≈ 306.45 ft/s, which rounds to 307 ft/s.

So the answer is E: 307 fps.

To determine the terminal velocity of the parachutist, we use the principle that at terminal velocity, the gravitational force equals the drag force. The drag force is given by:

\[
F_d = \frac{1}{2} \rho v^2 C_d A
\]

where:
- \( \rho \) is the air density,
- \( v \) is the velocity,
- \( C_d \) is the drag coefficient,
- \( A \) is the projected frontal area.

The gravitational force is the parachutist's weight, \( W = 175 \, \text{lb} \). Setting \( F_d = W \), we solve for \( v \):

\[
v = \sqrt{\frac{2 W}{\rho C_d A}}
\]

Given:
- \( W = 175 \, \text{lb} \),
- \( \rho = 0.0750 \, \text{lbm/ft}^3 \) at \( 70^\circ \text{F} \),
- \( C_d = 0.80 \),
- \( A = 2 \, \text{ft}^2 \).

First, convert \( \rho \) from \( \text{lbm/ft}^3 \) to \( \text{slugs/ft}^3 \) using \( 1 \, \text{slug} = 32.174 \, \text{lbm} \):

\[
\rho = \frac{0.0750}{32.174} \approx 0.00233 \, \text{slugs/ft}^3
\]

Substitute the values into the equation:

\[
v = \sqrt{\frac{2 \times 175}{0.00233 \times 0.80 \times 2}}
\]

Calculate the denominator:

\[
0.00233 \times 0.80 = 0.001864 \\
0.001864 \times 2 = 0.003728
\]

Calculate the numerator:

\[
2 \times 175 = 350
\]

Solve for \( v^2 \):

\[
v^2 = \frac{350}{0.003728} \approx 93,920
\]

Take the square root:

\[
v \approx \sqrt{93,920} \approx 306.4 \, \text{ft/s}
\]

Rounding to the nearest option, the terminal velocity is approximately \( 307 \, \text{ft/s} \).
