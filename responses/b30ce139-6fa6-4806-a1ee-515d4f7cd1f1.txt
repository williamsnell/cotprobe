Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about Say's Law, and I need to figure out the correct answer. I remember that Say's Law is an economic principle, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Let me try to recall what I learned in my economics class.

Say's Law, if I'm not mistaken, is part of classical economics. I think it's related to supply and demand. The basic idea, as far as I remember, is that supply creates its own demand. So, when producers supply goods, they also create the demand for those goods because by producing, they generate income which allows them to purchase other goods. That makes sense because when you make something, you sell it, and the money you get from selling it can be used to buy other things, thus creating demand in the economy.

Looking at the options, let's go through them one by one.

Option A: When price goes up, supply goes up. Hmm, that sounds like the law of supply, which states that as price increases, quantity supplied increases. But I don't think that's what Say's Law is about. Say's Law is more about the relationship between production and demand.

Option B: Price and supply have no correlation. That doesn't seem right. The law of supply does talk about a positive correlation between price and supply, so this is probably not the answer.

Option C: When supply goes up, demand goes down. That feels a bit off. Maybe it's the opposite? Or perhaps it's about how supply creates demand, not the other way around.

Option D: Demand creates its own supply. Wait, that's close to what I was thinking, but I thought it was supply creating demand. Let me think. Say's Law is often phrased as "Supply creates its own demand." So this option is the reverse. So D might not be correct.

Option E: When demand goes up, supply goes down. No, that's not how it works. Normally, if demand goes up, supply tends to increase to meet that demand, unless there are constraints.

Option F: When demand goes up, price goes down. That sounds like the law of demand, where higher demand can sometimes lead to higher prices, not lower. So F is probably incorrect.

Option G: Supply creates its own demand. Yes, this matches what I was thinking earlier. When you produce goods, you generate income, which allows you to buy other goods, thus creating demand. So G seems right.

Option H: It is better to give than receive. That's more of a moral or philosophical statement, not related to economics or Say's Law. So H is out.

Option I: Price creates its own demand. That doesn't quite fit. Prices influence demand, but I don't think that's the essence of Say's Law.

Option J: It is better to receive than give. Again, not related to economics or Say's Law. So J is irrelevant.

Wait, I should double-check. I think Say's Law is often summarized as "produce and you shall eat," which implies that production (supply) leads to the ability to consume (demand). So the correct statement is that supply creates its own demand, which is option G. I might have confused it with demand creating supply earlier, but no, it's definitely the other way around.

The correct answer is G: supply creates its own demand. Say's Law posits that production generates the income necessary to purchase goods, thereby creating demand. 

Answer: G
