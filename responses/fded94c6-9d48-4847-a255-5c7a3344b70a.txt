Okay, so I've got this question about Norcross's views on moral reasoning and the implications for different moral concepts. Let me break it down. The question is asking what Norcross would agree with regarding a being that's incapable of moral reasoning, even at the most basic level. The options are from A to J, each representing a different moral term.

First, I need to understand what each term means. Moral reasoning involves the ability to think through right and wrong, make ethical decisions, and understand the consequences of actions. If a being can't do this, what does that mean for its moral status?

Looking at the options:

A: an object of moral sympathy. I think this refers to being someone others feel sympathy for. Maybe even without reasoning, you can still be sympathized with, like an infant or animal.

B: a morally autonomous being. Autonomous means self-governing in moral terms. Without moral reasoning, they can't govern themselves morally, so they can't be autonomous.

C: a moral patient. A moral patient is someone who can be affected by actions and has interests, but doesn't necessarily reason morally. So this might still apply.

D: a being of moral integrity. Integrity implies consistency in moral principles, which requires reasoning, so probably not.

E: a moral agent. Agents are those who can act morally, requiring reasoning. So if they can't reason, they can't be agents.

F: a subject of moral discourse. This would mean they can engage in moral discussions, which requires reasoning, so they can't be subjects.

G: an ethically responsible entity. Responsibility implies accountability, which needs reasoning to understand right and wrong.

H: a being of value. Value could be intrinsic, so maybe they can still have value without reasoning.

I: a moral observer. Observers might watch or assess moral situations, perhaps without participating, but I'm not sure.

J: a morally accountable being. Accountability requires understanding actions and their consequences, so without reasoning, they can't be held accountable.

Now, the question is about what the being cannot be. So which of these can't exist without moral reasoning?

Norcross's view is about moral reasoning being necessary. So, if a being can't reason morally, it can't be a moral agent (E), because agents need to reason to act morally. Similarly, a morally responsible entity (G) or accountable being (J) wouldn't make sense without reasoning.

But looking at the options, which one is directly tied to moral reasoning? The question is about what they can't be. So, if a being lacks moral reasoning, it can't be a moral agent because agents are defined by their ability to reason and make moral choices.

Wait, but Norcross might be making a point about whether such beings are still within the moral community. For example, moral patients (C) like animals or infants can still be patients because they can be affected by actions, but they aren't agents. So the being can't be a moral agent (E) because they can't reason.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is E: a moral agent. Because moral agency requires the ability to reason.

So, putting it all together, the answer should be E.

The question asks which status a being incapable of moral reasoning cannot hold. Among the options, a moral agent (E) requires the ability to reason and make moral decisions, which such a being lacks. Therefore, the correct answer is:

E
