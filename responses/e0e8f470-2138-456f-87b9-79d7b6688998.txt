Question:

A reading specialist in a large public school system believes that the more time students spend reading, the better they will do in school. She plans a middle school experiment in which an SRS of 30 eighth graders will be assigned four extra hours of reading per week, an SRS of 30 seventh graders will be assigned two extra hours of reading per week, and an SRS of 30 sixth graders with no extra assigned reading will be a control group. After one school year, the mean GPAs from each group will be compared. Is this a good experimental design?

Options:

A: Yes, because the control group is necessary for comparison.
B: Yes.
C: No, because without blinding, there is a strong chance of a placebo effect.
D: No, because grade level is a lurking variable which may well be confounded with the variables under consideration.
E: No, because while this design may point out an association between reading and GPA, it cannot establish a cause-and-effect relationship.
F: No, because the experiment does not account for the varying reading levels of the students.
G: Yes, because the independent variable is manipulated by the researcher.
H: No, because the experimental design does not include a double-blind procedure.
I: Yes, because it tests the effect of different amounts of reading on GPA.
J: No, because the sample size of each group is not large enough.

Alright, I need to figure out whether the described experimental design is a good one. Let's break down the problem step by step.

So, the setup is that a reading specialist wants to test if more reading time improves school performance. She's using three groups: eighth graders with four extra hours, seventh graders with two extra hours, and a control group of sixth graders with no extra reading. After a year, she'll compare their GPAs.

First, I should recall what makes an experimental design good. Key factors include controlling for variables, having a proper control group, avoiding confounding variables, and ensuring that the experiment can establish causation.

Looking at the groups: eighth, seventh, and sixth graders. Wait, those are different grades. That means the students are of different ages and possibly different academic levels. The independent variable here is the amount of reading time, but grade level might be a lurking variable. Lurking variables are factors that aren't controlled but can affect the outcome. If, for example, eighth graders naturally perform better than sixth graders regardless of reading time, that could confound the results. The study might attribute GPA changes to reading time when it's actually due to grade level.

Another point is the control group. The sixth graders serve as a control, which is good for comparison. But the issue arises because each group is a different grade, which is a potential confounder. Without having similar grades in all groups, it's hard to isolate the effect of reading time.

Also, the experiment is assigning different reading times to different grades. So, any differences in GPA could be due to the reading time or the grade itself. For example, eighth graders might be more mature and perform better regardless of reading, making it hard to tell if reading caused the higher GPA.

I should check the options. Option D says, "No, because grade level is a lurking variable which may well be confounded with the variables under consideration." That seems to fit because the grades are different, which could influence the outcome, making it a bad design.

Other options: Option E talks about cause-and-effect, but this design does have manipulation (assigning reading time), so it can establish causation, but the grade issue might still be a problem. Option F mentions varying reading levels, but the experiment assigns the extra reading, not considering initial levels. However, the main issue is the grade level affecting the results.

So, the main problem is that grade level is a confounding variable, making the design flawed.
</think>

The experimental design is flawed because it does not control for grade level, which is a confounding variable. The different grades (sixth, seventh, and eighth) may naturally have different academic performances, making it impossible to isolate the effect of reading time on GPA. Therefore, the design is not good.

Answer: D
