Okay, so I have this question about Abelian groups of order 72 and how many structurally distinct ones there are. Hmm, I remember that Abelian groups can be classified using the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups, which involves breaking the group into cyclic groups of prime power order. 

First, I need to factorize 72. Let me think, 72 is equal to 8 times 9, right? Wait, actually, 72 is 8 times 9, and both 8 and 9 are powers of primes. 8 is 2^3 and 9 is 3^2. So the prime factors are 2 and 3, with exponents 3 and 2 respectively.

Now, according to the theorem, any finite Abelian group is a direct product of cyclic groups of prime power order. So I need to find all possible ways to express 72 as a product of these prime powers and then determine the number of distinct ways to combine them into cyclic groups.

Wait, no, more accurately, the theorem says the group can be expressed as the direct product of cyclic groups of orders that are powers of primes, and the order of the group is the product of these orders. So for 72, which is 2^3 * 3^2, I need to consider the possible ways to partition the exponents for each prime into sums that will correspond to the orders of the cyclic factors.

So for the prime 2 with exponent 3, I can have different partitions:
- 3: which is just one cyclic group of order 8 (since 2^3=8)
- 2+1: which would be a cyclic group of order 4 (2^2) and another of order 2 (2^1)
- 1+1+1: three cyclic groups of order 2 each

Similarly, for the prime 3 with exponent 2, the partitions are:
- 2: one cyclic group of order 9 (3^2)
- 1+1: two cyclic groups of order 3 each

Now, the total number of Abelian groups is the product of the number of ways to partition each prime's exponent. So for 2^3, there are three partitions, and for 3^2, there are two partitions. Therefore, the total number of distinct Abelian groups is 3 * 2 = 6.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Each possible combination of the partitions for each prime gives a distinct group. So for each way of breaking down the 2 part, I pair it with each way of breaking down the 3 part.

So, for 2^3:
1. [3] → C8
2. [2,1] → C4 × C2
3. [1,1,1] → C2 × C2 × C2

For 3^2:
1. [2] → C9
2. [1,1] → C3 × C3

Now, combining each possibility:
- C8 × C9
- C8 × (C3 × C3)
- (C4 × C2) × C9
- (C4 × C2) × (C3 × C3)
- (C2 × C2 × C2) × C9
- (C2 × C2 × C2) × (C3 × C3)

That's 6 distinct groups. So the answer should be 6, which is option C.

The number of structurally distinct Abelian groups of order 72 is determined by factoring 72 into prime powers (2^3 and 3^2) and considering all possible partitions of the exponents, leading to 6 distinct groups.

Answer: C
