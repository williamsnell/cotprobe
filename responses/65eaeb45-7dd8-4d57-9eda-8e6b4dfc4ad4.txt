Answer:
    
<think>
Okay, so I have this optics problem here about two convex lenses, and I need to find the focal length of their combination. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it step by step.

Alright, the problem says there are two thin convex lenses with focal lengths f₁ and f₂. They're separated by a distance equal to 2f₂. Oh, and f₁ is given as 3f₂. So, f₁ = 3f₂. I need to find the focal length of the combination.

Wait, when lenses are combined, how do you calculate the combined focal length? I remember there's a formula for when two lenses are placed together, but I'm not exactly sure of the exact expression. I think it's related to the reciprocals of their focal lengths and the distance between them. Let me try to recall.

Oh right, the formula for the equivalent focal length (F) of two lenses separated by a distance d is given by 1/F = 1/f₁ + 1/f₂ + (d)/(f₁ f₂). No, wait, is that correct? Or is it a different formula? Alternatively, I think the correct formula is 1/F = 1/f₁ + 1/f₂ when the lenses are in contact, but when there's a separation distance, an additional term comes into play. 

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. Oh, right! When two lenses are placed in air, the equivalent focal length can be found using the formula:

1/F = 1/f₁ + 1/f₂ + (d)/(f₁ f₂) * (1/(1 + (d/(f₁ + f₂))) )

Wait, no, that seems complicated. Maybe I should look for another approach. Alternatively, I've heard about the concept of lenses in contact and the formula for combined focal length when they're separated by some distance. Oh wait, I think the formula is:

1/F = (1/f₁ + 1/f₂) + (d)/(f₁ f₂)

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, another source I remember says that when two lenses are placed a distance d apart, the combined focal length F can be calculated using:

1/F = (1/f₁ + 1/f₂) + (d)/(f₁ f₂)

But I'm not 100% confident. Let me double-check. Another approach: when two lenses are in contact, the combined focal length is indeed 1/F = 1/f₁ + 1/f₂. But when they are separated by a distance d, another term involving d comes into play. 

Wait, I think the correct formula for two lenses separated by a distance d is:

1/F = 1/f₁ + 1/f₂ + (d)/(f₁ f₂)

So, let's proceed with that.

Given that f₁ = 3f₂, and the separation d is 2f₂. Let's substitute all these values into the formula.

So, 1/F = (1/(3f₂)) + (1/f₂) + (2f₂)/( (3f₂)(f₂) )

Let me compute each term step by step.

First term: 1/(3f₂) = 1/(3f₂)

Second term: 1/f₂ = 1/f₂

Third term: (2f₂) / (3f₂ * f₂) = (2f₂) / (3f₂²) = 2/(3f₂)

Wait, so adding all three terms:

1/F = (1/(3f₂)) + (1/f₂) + (2/(3f₂))

Let's add them up. Let's convert everything to a common denominator, which is 3f₂.

1/(3f₂) = 1/(3f₂)
1/f₂ = 3/(3f₂)
2/(3f₂) = 2/(3f₂)

Adding them: 1 + 3 + 2 = 6. So 6/(3f₂) = 2/(f₂)

So 1/F = 2/(f₂) → F = f₂/2.

Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see f₂/2. Let me check the options again.

Wait, the options are:

A: (3f₂)/2

B: (f₁ + f₂)/2 → since f₁=3f₂, this would be (4f₂)/2=2f₂

C: (2f₂)/3

D: 2f₂

E: (3f₂)/3 → which is f₂

F:5f₂

G: (2f₁)/3 → f₁=3f₂ → (2*(3f₂))/3= 2f₂

H:3f₁ → 9f₂

I: f₂/3

J:4f₂

Wait, I calculated F as f₂/2, but that's not one of the options. Hmm, did I make a mistake in the formula?

Wait a second, maybe I used the wrong formula. Another approach: perhaps the formula when two lenses are separated by distance d is:

1/F = (1/f₁ + 1/f₂) + (d)/(f₁ f₂) * (1) / (1 + (d)/(f₁ + f₂) )) )

Wait, that seems too complicated, but perhaps I should check another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the separation formula is different. Let me think again. Another way to approach this is to consider the image formed by the first lens, then the second lens acts on that image. But that might get complicated, but perhaps it's the right approach.

Wait, perhaps using the lens formula for each lens in sequence. Let me consider that approach.

The first lens has a focal length f₁=3f₂. An object is placed at some distance, but since we're looking for the equivalent focal length, we can assume the object is at infinity. Wait, no, that might not be the case. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use the formula for two lenses in series.

Wait, I found a formula that the equivalent focal length F when two lenses are separated by a distance d is given by:

1/F = 1/f₁ + 1/f₂ + (d)/(f₁ f₂)

But when I applied that, I got F = f₂/2, which isn't an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, let me check another source. Wait, I think the correct formula when two lenses are separated by a distance d is:

1/F = (1/f₁ + 1/f₂) + (d)/(f₁ f₂) * (1/(1 + (d/(f₁ + f₂))) )

Wait, that's getting too complicated, maybe I should look for a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is:

1/F = (f₁ f₂)/(f₁ f₂ + f₂ d + d f₁ )

Wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is:

1/F = 1/f₁ + 1/f₂ - (d)/(f₁ f₂)

Wait, that might change the calculation.

Let me try that. So, using 1/F = 1/f₁ + 1/f₂ - (d)/(f₁ f₂)

Substituting f₁ =3f₂, d=2f₂.

So,

1/F = (1/(3f₂)) + (1/f₂) - (2f₂)/(3f₂ * f₂ )

Let's compute each term:

1/(3f₂) = 1/(3f₂)

1/f₂ = 3/(3f₂)

The third term: (2f₂)/(3f₂ * f₂) = (2f₂)/(3f₂²) )= 2/(3f₂)

Now, adding the first two terms: 1/(3f₂) + 3/(3f₂) = 4/(3f₂)

Subtracting the third term: 4/(3f₂) - 2/(3f₂) = 2/(3f₂)

So 1/F = 2/(3f₂) → F = 3f₂/2.

Looking back at the options, option A is (3f₂)/2, which matches. So the focal length would be (3f₂)/2, which is option A.

Wait, but earlier with the first formula I got F= f₂/2, which wasn't an option, but with this second formula, I get F=3f₂/2, which is option A. So perhaps I used the wrong sign in the formula earlier.

Wait, but why would the formula have a minus sign? Let me think. Oh, perhaps I'm mixing up the sign conventions. In optics, the sign of the focal length depends on whether the lens is converging or diverging. Convex lenses have positive focal lengths.

But in this problem, both lenses are convex, so their focal lengths are positive. Now, when two converging lenses are placed together, the combined focal length is shorter than either individual focal length (if placed in contact), but with separation, it might depend.

Wait, in the first approach, using 1/F = 1/f₁ + 1/f₂ + d/(f₁ f₂), I got F= f₂/2, but that's not an option. But using 1/F = 1/f₁ +1/f₂ − d/(f₁ f₂), I get F=3f₂/2, which is option A.

Hmm, but which formula is correct? Let me think again. I might have made a mistake in the initial formula. I think the correct formula for the equivalent focal length when two lenses are separated by distance d is:

1/F = 1/f₁ + 1/f₂ + (d)/(f₁ f₂) * (1/(1 + (d/(f₁ + f₂))) )

Wait, perhaps that's more accurate. Let me plug in the values.

f₁=3f₂, f₂=f₂, d=2f₂.

Compute 1/(f₁ + f₂) = 1/(4f₂). So d/(f₁ + f₂) = 2f₂/(4f₂) = 0.5.

So 1 + d/(f₁ + f₂) = 1.5.

So denominator is 1.5.

Then, the third term is (d)/(f₁ f₂) * (1/(1.5)).

Compute (d)/(f₁ f₂) = (2f₂)/(3f₂ * f₂) )= 2/(3f₂).

Multiply by 1/1.5 (which is 2/3): 2/(3f₂) * 2/3 = 4/(9f₂).

So the third term is 4/(9f₂).

Now, 1/F = 1/f₁ +1/f₂ + (third term).

1/f₁ = 1/(3f₂) = 1/(3f₂).

1/f₂ = 1/f₂ = 3/(3f₂).

So adding 1/f₁ +1/f₂ = 4/(3f₂).

Adding the third term: 4/(3f₂) + 4/(9f₂) = (12 +4)/(9f₂) = 16/(9f₂).

So 1/F =16/(9f₂) → F=9f₂/16. Hmm, that's a different value, and it's not one of the options. So perhaps that's not the right approach.

I think I'm getting stuck here. Let me try a different approach. Perhaps using the lens formula for each lens in series.

The first lens forms an image, and the second lens then uses that image as its object. The overall effect is that the combination behaves like a single lens with focal length F.

To find the equivalent focal length F, we can consider the image formed by the first lens and then the second lens. Let me assume that the object is placed at a distance u from the first lens. The image formed by the first lens will be at a distance v₁ from it, given by 1/v₁ = 1/f₁ - 1/u.

Then, this image will be at a distance v₁ - d from the second lens, because the separation between the lenses is d. So the object distance for the second lens would be (v₁ - d), and the image formed by the second lens will be at a distance v₂ from it, given by 1/v₂ = 1/f₂ - 1/(v₁ - d).

For the combination to act as a single lens, the image formed by the second lens should be at infinity (so that the entire system behaves as a converging lens). Wait, no, perhaps it's better to consider that when the object is at infinity, the image formed by the first lens is at f₁. Then, the second lens would have an object at a distance f₁ + d from it, and the image formed would be at F, the equivalent focal length.

Wait, no, perhaps the object is at a finite distance, but maybe it's easier to consider the case where the object is at infinity. Let me try that.

If the object is at infinity, the image formed by the first lens is at f₁ (since for an object at infinity, the image is at the focal point). So, the image distance v₁ = f₁ =3f₂.

The separation between the lenses is d=2f₂, so the image is at 3f₂ from the first lens, which is 3f₂ - d = 3f₂ - 2f₂ = f₂ from the second lens.

Wait, no, the image from the first lens is at 3f₂ on the other side of the first lens. The separation between the lenses is 2f₂, so the distance between the image and the second lens is d + v₁? Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting the positions wrong.

Wait, let's model this: the first lens is at position 0, the second lens is at position d=2f₂. The object is at position x= -infinity (assuming the object is on the left side of the first lens).

The image from the first lens is at v₁ = f₁ =3f₂, which is on the right side of the first lens, at position 3f₂. The second lens is at position d=2f₂, so the distance between the image and the second lens is 3f₂ - 2f₂ =f₂. So the object for the second lens is at position 2f₂ (the position of the second lens) minus the image position, which is 3f₂. Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of relative positions.

Wait, the first lens is at 0, the second at 2f₂. The image from the first lens is at 3f₂ (to the right of the first lens). The distance from the second lens to this image is 3f₂ - 2f₂ = f₂. So the object distance for the second lens is u₂ = f₂ (on its left side, so u₂ is negative if we take the standard sign convention where distances to the right are positive).

Wait, no, the object distance for the second lens would be the distance between the image of the first lens and the second lens. Since the image is at 3f₂ and the second lens is at 2f₂, the distance between them is 3f₂ - 2f₂ = f₂. So the object for the second lens is at u₂ = -f₂ (since it's on the left side of the second lens).

Now, using the lens formula for the second lens: 1/v₂ = 1/f₂ - 1/u₂.

Substituting u₂ = -f₂:

1/v₂ = 1/f₂ - 1/(-f₂) = 1/f₂ + 1/f₂ = 2/f₂ → v₂ = f₂/2.

So the image formed by the second lens is at v₂ = f₂/2 on its right side. Now, considering the entire system, the object is at infinity, and the image is at f₂/2 from the second lens. So the equivalent focal length F of the combination would be the distance from the first lens to this image. The first lens is at 0, the image is at 2f₂ (position of the second lens) + v₂ = 2f₂ + (f₂/2) = (5f₂/2).

Wait, that would suggest that the image is at 5f₂/2 from the first lens. But that doesn't make sense because when the object is at infinity, the image should form at the focal length of the combination. So perhaps I'm making a mistake here.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the image formed by the second lens is at F, the focal length of the combination, measured from the first lens. So, the total distance from the first lens to the image is F. But in the calculation above, the image is at 5f₂/2 from the first lens. So F would be 5f₂/2, which is option F:5f₂. But that doesn't match, because 5f₂/2 is 2.5f₂, which isn't option F (option F is 5f₂). Hmm, perhaps this approach isn't correct.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that when the object is at infinity, the image formed by the combination is at F, the focal length of the combination. So, the image from the first lens is at f₁ =3f₂. The second lens then forms an image at F, so maybe the distance from the second lens to this image is F - d (since the second lens is at d=2f₂ from the first). So the object distance for the second lens is 3f₂ - d =3f₂ -2f₂ =f₂, as before. Then, using the lens formula:

1/v₂ = 1/f₂ -1/u₂, where u₂ is the object distance for the second lens. Here, u₂ = 3f₂ - d =f₂, but u₂ is the distance from the second lens to the image of the first lens, so u₂ = -f₂ (since it's on the left side).

So, 1/v₂ = 1/f₂ - (-1/f₂) = 2/f₂ → v₂ = f₂/2.

This v₂ is the image distance from the second lens. So the total image distance from the first lens is d + v₂ =2f₂ + (f₂/2)=5f₂/2. But since the object is at infinity, the image should be at F, the focal length of the combination. So F=5f₂/2. But looking at the options, option F is 5f₂, which is not 5f₂/2. So perhaps this approach is flawed.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the sign convention. Let me try using the Gaussian lens formula for two lenses in series.

The formula for two lenses in series with separation d is:

1/F = (1/f₁ + 1/f₂) + d/(f₁ f₂) * (1 + d/(f₁ + f₂))^{-1}

Wait, I think I saw this formula before. Let me try plugging in the values.

f₁=3f₂, f₂=f₂, d=2f₂.

Compute 1 + d/(f₁ + f₂) = 1 + (2f₂)/(3f₂ + f₂)=1 + (2f₂)/(4f₂)=1 + 0.5=1.5.

So denominator is 1.5.

Now, compute d/(f₁ f₂) = (2f₂)/(3f₂ * f₂)=2/(3f₂).

Multiply by 1/1.5: 2/(3f₂) * 2/3 =4/(9f₂).

So the third term is 4/(9f₂).

Now, 1/f₁ +1/f₂ =1/(3f₂) +1/f₂=1/(3f₂) +3/(3f₂)=4/(3f₂).

Adding the third term:4/(3f₂) +4/(9f₂)= (12 +4)/(9f₂)=16/(9f₂).

So 1/F=16/(9f₂) → F=9f₂/16. Hmm, but that's not one of the options. So perhaps this approach is incorrect.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try another approach. Let me consider the power of the lenses. The power P of a lens is given by P=1/f. So, the power of the first lens is P₁=1/(3f₂), and the second lens is P₂=1/f₂.

When two lenses are separated by a distance d, their combined power is given by:

P_total = P₁ + P₂ + (d * P₁ * P₂)

Wait, is that correct? I think that's the formula for the power when two lenses are separated by distance d. So,

P_total = (1/(3f₂)) + (1/f₂) + (2f₂) * (1/(3f₂)) * (1/f₂)

Wait, let me compute each term:

P₁=1/(3f₂)
P₂=1/f₂
d=2f₂

So,

P_total = (1/(3f₂)) + (1/f₂) + (2f₂) * (1/(3f₂)) * (1/f₂)

Compute each part:

First two terms: (1 + 3)/(3f₂) )=4/(3f₂).

Third term: 2f₂ * (1/(3f₂)) * (1/f₂) = 2f₂ * 1/(3f₂²) )= 2/(3f₂).

So, P_total =4/(3f₂) + 2/(3f₂) =6/(3f₂)= 2/f₂.

Therefore, the equivalent focal length F=1/P_total= f₂/2.

But wait, earlier I thought that using this formula gives F= f₂/2, but that's not one of the options. Wait, looking back, option A is (3f₂)/2, which is 1.5f₂, and option I is f₂/3, which is about 0.333f₂.

Hmm, I'm confused because using the power method, I get F= f₂/2, but that's not an option. So perhaps the formula I used is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula for the power when two lenses are separated by distance d is:

P_total = P₁ + P₂ + (d * P₁ * P₂)/(1 + d * (P₁ + P₂))

Wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is P_total = P₁ + P₂ + (d * P₁ P₂)/(1 + d (P₁ + P₂)).

Let me try that.

P₁=1/(3f₂), P₂=1/f₂, d=2f₂.

Compute denominator:1 + d(P₁ + P₂) = 1 + 2f₂*(1/(3f₂) +1/f₂) )=1 +2f₂*(4/(3f₂))=1 + (8/3)= (3 +8)/3=11/3.

Now, numerator: d P₁ P₂ =2f₂*(1/(3f₂)) * (1/f₂)=2f₂*(1/(3f₂²))=2/(3f₂).

So, the third term is (2/(3f₂)) / (11/3) )= (2/(3f₂)) * (3/11) )= 2/(11f₂).

Adding P₁ + P₂: (1/(3f₂) )+ (1/f₂ )= (1 +3)/(3f₂)=4/(3f₂).

So P_total=4/(3f₂) +2/(11f₂) = [44 +6]/(33f₂) )=50/(33f₂).

Thus, F=1/P_total=33f₂/50. Hmm, that's not one of the options either.

I think I'm going in circles here. Let me try to think differently. Since I'm getting conflicting results, perhaps I should go back to the beginning and ensure I use the correct formula.

The correct formula for the combined focal length of two lenses separated by a distance d is:

1/F = (1/f₁ + 1/f₂) + (d)/(f₁ f₂) * (1/(1 + (d/(f₁ + f₂)))))

But perhaps it's easier to use the formula from the textbook. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

1/F = (f₁ f₂)/( (f₁ + f₂) + d )

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

F = (f₁ f₂) / (f₁ + f₂ + d )

Wait, let me test that.

Substituting f₁=3f₂, f₂=f₂, d=2f₂.

F = (3f₂ * f₂) / (3f₂ + f₂ + 2f₂ ) = 3f₂² / (6f₂ )= (3f₂²)/(6f₂ )= f₂/2.

Again, same result as before. So F= f₂/2, but that's not one of the options. So perhaps this formula isn't correct either.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a negative sign in the formula. Let me check another source. Oh, I remember now! When two lenses are placed a distance d apart, the formula for the equivalent focal length F is:

1/F = (1/f₁ + 1/f₂) - (d)/(f₁ f₂)

Wait, let me try that. Using:

1/F = (1/f₁ + 1/f₂) - (d)/(f₁ f₂)

Substituting f₁=3f₂, f₂=f₂, d=2f₂.

So,

1/F = (1/(3f₂) + 1/f₂) - (2f₂)/(3f₂ * f₂ )

Compute each term:

1/(3f₂) +1/f₂ = (1 +3)/(3f₂ )=4/(3f₂).

Third term: (2f₂)/(3f₂² )=2/(3f₂).

So,

1/F =4/(3f₂) - 2/(3f₂ )=2/(3f₂).

Thus, F=3f₂/2.

That's option A. So the correct answer is A: (3f₂)/2.

Wait, that makes sense. So the formula I should have used is 1/F = 1/f₁ +1/f₂ - (d)/(f₁ f₂).

So the correct answer is option A.
</think>

To determine the focal length of the combination of two convex lenses separated by a distance \( d = 2f_2 \), with focal lengths \( f_1 = 3f_2 \) and \( f_2 \), we use the formula for the equivalent focal length \( F \) of two lenses separated by a distance:

\[
\frac{1}{F} = \frac{1}{f_1} + \frac{1}{f_2} - \frac{d}{f_1 f_2}
\]

### Step 1: Substitute the given values
Given:
- \( f_1 = 3f_2 \)
- \( d = 2f_2 \)

Substitute these into the formula:

\[
\frac{1}{F} = \frac{1}{3f_2} + \frac{1}{f_2} - \frac{2f_2}{(3f_2)(f_2)}
\]

### Step 2: Simplify each term
1. \( \frac{1}{3f_2} \) remains as is.
2. \( \frac{1}{f_2} = \frac{3}{3f_2} \).
3. \( \frac{2f_2}{(3f_2)(f_2)} = \frac{2}{3f_2} \).

### Step 3: Combine the terms
\[
\frac{1}{F} = \frac{1}{3f_2} + \frac{3}{3f_2} - \frac{2}{3f_2}
\]

\[
\frac{1}{F} = \frac{1 + 3 - 2}{3f_2} = \frac{2}{3f_2}
\]

### Step 4: Solve for \( F \)
\[
F = \frac{3f_2}{2}
\]

### Step 5: Match with the options
The calculated focal length \( F = \frac{3f_2}{2} \) corresponds to **Option A**.

ANSWER: A
