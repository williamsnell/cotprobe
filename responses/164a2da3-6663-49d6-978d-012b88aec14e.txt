Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here about ordering numbers from least to greatest. There are eight options, labeled A through H. I need to figure out which list is correctly ordered. Let me see how to approach this.

First, I'll go through each option one by one. Each option has four numbers in a list, and I need to check if they're in ascending order. If they're not, I can eliminate that option.

Starting with option A: 167,213; 161,455; 17,400; 116,633. Wait, that doesn't look right. Let me list them numerically. 17,400 is the smallest, then 116,633, then 161,455, and finally 167,213. So the given order is 167k, 161k, 17k, 116k. That's definitely not from least to greatest because 167k is the largest and it's first. So A is out.

Next is option B: 120,209; 120,902; 125,466; 125,464. Hmm, let me check the order. The first number is 120,209, then 120,902. So far, that's correct because 209 is less than 902. Then comes 125,466, followed by 125,464. Wait, 466 is more than 464, so the last two are in the wrong order. So the list should be 120,209; 120,902; 125,464; 125,466. Therefore, B is not correctly ordered.

Moving on to option C: 160,233; 171,141; 116,645; 167,703. Let's see. The first number is 160k, then 171k, which is higher, so that's good. Next is 116k, which is lower than 171k, so that's a problem. Then 167k, which is higher than 116k but lower than 171k. So the correct order would be 116k; 160k; 167k; 171k. But the given order is 160k, 171k, 116k, 167k. That's definitely not in order. So C is incorrect.

Option D: 160,233; 171,141; 11,645; 16,703. Let me list these. 11,645 is the smallest, then 16,703, then 160k, and then 171k. The given order is 160k first, which is way too big. So D is not ordered correctly.

Option E: 167,213; 161,455; 17,400; 11,633. Let's break it down. The numbers are 167k, 161k, 17k, 11k. So the correct order would be 11k, 17k, 161k, 167k. But the given order starts with the highest, so E is incorrect.

Option F: 10,354; 10,600; 104,321; 106,213. Let me check each step. 10,354 to 10,600 is correct because 354 < 600. Then 104,321 comes next. Wait, 10,600 is 10 thousand, and 104k is 104 thousand, so that's a big jump but correct. Then 106,213 is higher than 104,321, so that's right. So F's order is correct: 10,354 < 10,600 < 104,321 < 106,213. That seems correct.

But let me check the other options just to be sure.

Option G: 12,209; 12,902; 125,466; 125,464. The first two are 12k, which is correct. Then comes 125k, which is higher. But the last two are 125,466 and 125,464. Since 466 > 464, the last two are in the wrong order. So G isn't correct.

Option H: 18,209; 18,902; 185,466; 185,464. Let's see. The first two are 18k, which is correct. Then 185k, which is higher. The last two are 185,466 and 185,464. Again, 466 > 464, so the last two are in the wrong order. So H is incorrect.

So after checking all options, the only one that's in correct order from least to greatest is option F.
