Okay, so I have this equation x - e^{-x} = 0, and I need to find the smallest positive root using the Regula-Falsi method. The question also asks for initial approximations and then to find the root correct to three decimal places. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

First, I know that the Regula-Falsi method is a numerical technique used to find roots of a function. It's similar to the secant method but uses linear interpolation to approximate the root, which can sometimes converge faster. But before I jump into applying the method, I need to understand the function and its behavior.

The equation is f(x) = x - e^{-x}. I want to find where this function equals zero. To find the initial approximations, I should graph the function or at least evaluate it at some points to see where it crosses zero.

Let me start by plugging in some values. I'll make a table of x and f(x):

- x = 0: f(0) = 0 - e^{0} = 0 - 1 = -1
- x = 0.5: f(0.5) = 0.5 - e^{-0.5} ≈ 0.5 - 0.6065 ≈ -0.1065
- x = 0.6: f(0.6) = 0.6 - e^{-0.6} ≈ 0.6 - 0.5488 ≈ 0.0512
- x = 0.7: f(0.7) = 0.7 - e^{-0.7} ≈ 0.7 - 0.4966 ≈ 0.2034

Wait, so between x=0.5 and x=0.6, the function goes from negative to positive. That means there's a root in that interval. Since we're looking for the smallest positive root, this is likely the one we're after.

Wait, let me check x=0.55:

f(0.55) = 0.55 - e^{-0.55} ≈ 0.55 - 0.5769 ≈ -0.0269

Still negative. How about x=0.56:

f(0.56) ≈ 0.56 - e^{-0.56} ≈ 0.56 - 0.5688 ≈ -0.0088

Still negative. x=0.57:

f(0.57) ≈ 0.57 - e^{-0.57} ≈ 0.57 - 0.5634 ≈ 0.0066

So between 0.56 and 0.57, f(x) crosses from negative to positive. So the root is around 0.56 to 0.57.

But the options given are A: 0.456, B:0.765, C:0.850, D:0.100, E:0.999, F:0.567, G:0.001, H:0.350, I:0.654, J:1.234.

Wait, the initial approximations for Regula-Falsi are two points, a and b, such that f(a) and f(b) have opposite signs. Since the root is between 0.56 and 0.57, perhaps the initial approximations are a=0.56 and b=0.57. But these exact values aren't among the options. Wait, but maybe the options are giving possible roots, and I need to pick the correct one after using Regula-Falsi.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial approximations are given as two points, but the options here are the possible roots. Wait, the question is a bit ambiguous. Let me reread it.

"Given the equation: x - e^{-x} = 0. determine the initial approximations for finding the smallest positive root. Use these to find the root correct to three decimal places with Regula-Falsi method."

Wait, maybe the options are the possible initial approximations, and I have to choose which two to use. But the options are single numbers, so perhaps the question is asking for the root itself, and the options are the possible roots.

Wait, no, the initial approximations are needed to apply Regula-Falsi. So perhaps the options are the possible initial guesses, and after using Regula-Falsi, the correct root is one of the options.

Wait, but the question says "determine the initial approximations" and then "find the root correct to three decimal places with Regula-Falsi method." So perhaps the initial approximations are given as part of the options, but the way the question is phrased, it's a bit confusing.

Wait, perhaps the initial approximations are two points, a and b, which are given as options, and I have to choose those two. But the options are single values, so maybe the question is asking for the root, which after applying Regula-Falsi, is one of these options.

Wait, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The function x - e^{-x} = 0.

We know f(0) = -1, f(0.5) ≈ -0.1065, f(0.6) ≈ 0.0512, so the root is between 0.5 and 0.6. But the options don't have 0.5 or 0.6. The closest is F:0.567.

Wait, but using more precise calculations:

Let me compute f(0.567):

e^{-0.567} ≈ Let's calculate. e^{-0.5} is about 0.6065, e^{-0.6} is about 0.5488. So at x=0.567, which is between 0.5 and 0.6, closer to 0.6. Let me compute e^{-0.567} more accurately.

Using a calculator approximation:

The Taylor series for e^{-x} around x=0 is 1 - x + x²/2! - x³/3! + ... but maybe it's easier to compute using a calculator.

Alternatively, using a known value: e^{-0.567} ≈ Let's see, 0.567 is approximately ln(2) is about 0.6931, so 0.567 is less than that. Let me compute e^{-0.567}.

Alternatively, using a calculator function: e^{-0.567} ≈ 0.567? Wait, no, that can't be. Wait, e^{-0.567} is approximately 0.567? That's interesting because then x=0.567 would make f(x)=0.567 - e^{-0.567} = 0.567 - 0.567 = 0. So x=0.567 is a solution. Wait, is that accurate?

Wait, I think that might be a coincidence. Let me check more accurately. Let's compute e^{-0.567} using a calculator.

Using a calculator, e^{-0.567} ≈ 0.567. Wait, that's interesting. So f(0.567) = 0.567 - 0.567 = 0. So 0.567 is a root.

But wait, I'm not sure if that's accurate. Let me compute it more precisely. Let me use a calculator for e^{-0.567}.

Using a calculator: e^{-0.567} ≈ e^{-0.567} = 1 / e^{0.567} ≈ 1 / 1.763 ≈ 0.567. Wait, that's a bit rough. Let me compute it more accurately.

Alternatively, using a more precise method, perhaps using a Taylor expansion around x=0.6.

But maybe I'm overcomplicating. The point is that the function f(x) = x - e^{-x} crosses zero at x ≈ 0.567. Therefore, the root is approximately 0.567, which is option F.

So the initial approximations would be points around where the function changes sign. For example, a=0.5 and b=0.6, since f(0.5) is negative and f(0.6) is positive. But the options given are single values, and the correct root is F:0.567.

The equation \( x - e^{-x} = 0 \) is analyzed to find the smallest positive root using the Regula-Falsi method. Evaluating the function at several points shows that the root lies between 0.5 and 0.6. Further refinement reveals that \( x \approx 0.567 \) satisfies the equation, making it the correct root.

The final answer is:

F
