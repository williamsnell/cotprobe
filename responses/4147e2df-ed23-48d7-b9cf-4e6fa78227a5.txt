Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here about calculating the vibrational contribution to the molar internal energy of a gas. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see if I can work through it.

The question gives me the formula for U_m,vib, which is the vibrational part of the molar internal energy. The formula is U_m,vib = R * sum from s=1 to 3N-6 of (θ_s)/(e^(θ_s/T) - 1), where θ_s is hν_s/k, and ν_s is the vibrational frequency of mode s.

Wait, but in the problem, they mention that the wavenumber ν_s is given as 900 cm^-1. Oh, right, wavenumber is related to frequency. I think the relationship is ν = c * ŷ, where c is the speed of light. So I'll need to find ν_s from the given wavenumber.

But wait, in the formula, θ_s is hν_s/k. So first, I need to calculate θ_s for this mode. Let me jot down the given values:

Temperature T is 25°C, which is 298 K. The wavenumber ŷ_s is 900 cm^-1. So ν_s = c * ŷ_s. The speed of light c is approximately 3.00 x 10^10 cm/s. So ν_s = 900 cm^-1 * 3e10 cm/s = 2.7e13 s^-1.

Now, compute θ_s: θ_s = hν_s /k. Planck's constant h is 6.626e-34 J·s, and Boltzmann's constant k is 1.381e-23 J/K.

So θ_s = (6.626e-34 J·s) * (2.7e13 s^-1) / (1.381e-23 J/K).

Calculating numerator: 6.626e-34 * 2.7e13 = let's see... 6.626 * 2.7 is about 17.89, so 17.89e-21 J. Wait, actually:

Wait, 6.626e-34 * 2.7e13 = 6.626 * 2.7 = 17.89, and exponents: 1e-34 * 1e13 = 1e-21, so 17.89e-21 J. Then divide by k: 1.381e-23 J/K.

So θ_s = 17.89e-21 / 1.381e-23 = (17.89 / 1.381) * 1e2 ≈ let's calculate 17.89 /1.381 ≈ 12.96. So 12.96 * 100 = 1296. So θ_s ≈ 1296 K.

Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check the calculation. Maybe I made a mistake in the exponents.

Wait, 6.626e-34 * 2.7e13 = (6.626 * 2.7) * 1e(-34 +13) ) = 17.89e-21 J·s·s^-1 = 17.89e-21 J.

Then dividing by 1.381e-23 J/K: 17.89e-21 / 1.381e-23 = (17.89 / 1.381) * 1e2. 17.89 / 1.381 ≈ 12.96, so 12.96e2 = 1296. So θ_s ≈ 1296 K.

Hmm, okay. Now, I need to compute θ_s/(e^(θ_s/T) - 1). T is 298 K.

So θ_s is 1296 K. Let's compute θ_s/T: 1296 / 298 ≈ 4.35.

So e^(4.35) is approximately what? Let me think. e^4 is about 54.6, e^0.35 is about 1.419. So e^4.35 ≈ 54.6 * 1.419 ≈ 77.3.

So denominator e^(θ_s/T) -1 ≈ 77.3 - 1 =76.3.

So θ_s/(e^(θ_s/T) -1) ≈ 1296 /76.3 ≈ let's calculate 1296 ÷ 76.3.

Divide 1296 by 76.3: 76.3 * 17 = 1297.1, which is just a bit over 1296. So approximately 16.95. Wait, 76.3*16=1220.8, 76.3*17=1297.1. So 1296 is about 16.98.

So each term is approximately 16.98 J/mol? Wait, no, wait. Wait, the units: θ_s has units of K, right? Because it's (hν/k), and since ν is in s^-1, hν is J, k is J/K, so θ_s is in K.

Wait, but in the formula, it's θ_s/(e^{θ_s/T} -1), but θ_s is in K, T is in K, so θ_s/T is dimensionless. So the denominator is dimensionless. So the numerator is K, so the whole term is K. But wait, in the formula, U_m,vib is in J/mol or kJ/mol, right?

Wait, R is 8.314 J/mol·K. So each term in the sum is θ_s/(e^{θ_s/T} -1), which has units of K. Then U_m,vib is R times the sum, so each term in the sum is multiplied by R (J/mol·K) times K, giving J/mol per term.

Wait, but I'm just considering one mode here, so the sum is just one term. So U_m,vib for this mode would be R * (θ_s/(e^{θ_s/T} -1)).

So substituting the numbers: R is 8.314 J/mol·K. So 8.314 * (16.98) ≈ let's compute that. 8 * 17 is 136, so 8.314 *16.98 ≈ 8 * 16.98 = 135.84, plus 0.314*16.98 ≈ 5.34, so total ≈ 141.18 J/mol.

Wait, that's about 0.141 kJ/mol.

Looking at the options, option J is 0.14 kJ/mol. So that's the answer.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations because I might have messed up somewhere.

First, ν_s = c * ŷ = 3e10 cm/s *900 cm^-1 = 2.7e13 s^-1.

θ_s = h ν_s /k = (6.626e-34 Js)(2.7e13 s^-1) / (1.381e-23 J/K) = (6.626 *2.7e-34+13 ) / 1.381e-23.

Wait, exponents: 1e-34 * 1e13 = 1e-21. So 6.626e-34 *2.7e13= (6.626 *2.7) *1e-21 ≈17.89e-21.

Then 17.89e-21 /1.381e-23 = (17.89 / 1.381) * 1e2 ≈12.96 *100=1296 K. So that's correct.

Then θ_s/T = 1296/298≈4.35.

e^4.35 ≈ let me compute more accurately. e^4 is 54.598, e^0.35: ln(2) is 0.693, so 0.35 is about 41% of that. Let me compute e^0.35: using Taylor series or approximation.

e^x ≈1 +x +x²/2 +x³/6. x=0.35.

1 +0.35 =1.35; + (0.35)^2/2=0.1225/2=0.06125 →1.41125. + (0.35)^3/6=0.042875/6≈0.0071458 →1.4184. Next term: x^4/24=0.35^4=0.0150; 0.015/24=0.000625 →1.419. So e^0.35≈1.419.

So e^4.35= e^4 * e^0.35 ≈54.598 *1.419 ≈ 54.598 *1.4=76.437, 54.598 *0.019=1.037 → total ≈77.474. So e^4.35≈77.474.

So e^θ_s/T -1 =77.474 -1=76.474.

θ_s / (e^{θ_s/T} -1) =1296 /76.474 ≈ let's compute 76.474 *17=1299. So 1296 is 1299 -3, so 17 - (3/76.474) ≈17 -0.039≈16.961.

So R=8.314 J/mol·K. So U =8.314 *16.961 ≈?

Compute 8 *16.961=135.688, 0.314 *16.961≈5.316. So total ≈141.004 J/mol. Convert to kJ: 0.141 kJ/mol.

Looking at the options, J is 0.14 kJ/mol. So the correct answer is J.

The contribution of a normal mode with wavenumber $\widetilde{v} = 900 \, \mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ to the molar internal energy $U_{\mathrm{m}, \mathrm{vib}}$ at $25^\circ \mathrm{C}$ is calculated using the formula:

\[
U_{\mathrm{m}, \mathrm{vib}} = R \cdot \frac{\theta_s}{e^{\theta_s / T} - 1}
\]

where $\theta_s = \frac{h \nu_s}{k}$, $\nu_s = c \cdot \widetilde{v}$, $c = 3.00 \times 10^{10} \, \mathrm{cm/s}$, $h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \mathrm{J \cdot s}$, $k = 1.381 \times 10^{-23} \, \mathrm{J/K}$, and $T = 298 \, \mathrm{K}$.

1. **Calculate $\nu_s$:**  
   \[
   \nu_s = c \cdot \widetilde{v} = (3.00 \times 10^{10} \, \mathrm{cm/s}) \cdot (900 \, \mathrm{cm}^{-1}) = 2.7 \times 10^{13} \, \mathrm{s}^{-1}
   \]

2. **Calculate $\theta_s$:**  
   \[
   \theta_s = \frac{h \nu_s}{k} = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \mathrm{J \cdot s}) \cdot (2.7 \times 10^{13} \, \mathrm{s}^{-1})}{1.381 \times 10^{-23} \, \mathrm{J/K}} \approx 1296 \, \mathrm{K}
   \]

3. **Calculate $\theta_s / T$:**  
   \[
   \frac{\theta_s}{T} = \frac{1296}{298} \approx 4.35
   \]

4. **Calculate $e^{\theta_s / T}$:**  
   Using approximations,  
   \[
   e^{4.35} \approx 77.47
   \]

5. **Calculate the denominator $e^{\theta_s / T} - 1$:**  
   \[
   e^{\theta_s / T} - 1 \approx 77.47 - 1 = 76.47
   \]

6. **Calculate $\theta_s / (e^{\theta_s / T} - 1)$:**  
   \[
   \frac{\theta_s}{e^{\theta_s / T} - 1} = \frac{1296}{76.47} \approx 16.96 \, \mathrm{K}
   \]

7. **Calculate $U_{\mathrm{m}, \mathrm{vib}}$:**  
   \[
   U_{\mathrm{m}, \mathrm{vib}} = R \cdot \frac{\theta_s}{e^{\theta_s / T} - 1} = (8.314 \, \mathrm{J/mol \cdot K}) \cdot 16.96 \, \mathrm{K} \approx 141.00 \, \mathrm{J/mol} = 0.141 \, \mathrm{kJ/mol}
   \]

The closest option is **J: 0.14 kJ/mol**.
