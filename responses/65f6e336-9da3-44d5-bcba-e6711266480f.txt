Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about light reflection from a tiny mirror. Hmm, let's try to figure it out step by step.

The question says that sunlight is reflected off a small plane mirror that's 2 mm by 2 mm. The mirror is reflecting light onto a screen, and we need to determine the shape of the illuminated area when the screen is placed at two different distances: part (a) is 1 cm away and part (b) is 2 meters away.

Wait, I remember something about the shape of the reflection from a plane mirror. Oh right, when a plane mirror reflects light, the reflection should be a collimated beam if the source is a point. But wait, the sun is a large source, so maybe it's a different scenario. Let me think.

Wait, no, the sun is a distant source. So the light rays from the sun are nearly parallel. When they hit the mirror, they reflect as a parallel beam as well. So the reflection would be a collimated beam. But if the mirror is a small plane, like 2x2 mm, how does that affect the shape on the screen?

Wait, no. Wait, a plane mirror reflects light in such a way that each point on the mirror reflects light back in the opposite direction. So, if the mirror is small, it's like a point source of light. Wait, but the sun is a distant point source, so the mirror would reflect the light as if it were a point source at the mirror's position. So the reflection would be a collimated beam, but when projected onto a screen, the shape depends on the distance.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. When a plane mirror reflects light from a distant source, it reflects it as a parallel beam. So the reflected light is collimated. So when this beam hits a screen, the shape depends on the size of the mirror.

Wait, no. Wait, the mirror is 2x2 mm. So each point on the mirror reflects a small portion of the light. So when the screen is close, like 1 cm away, the light from different parts of the mirror will spread out, creating an image. But if the screen is far away, like 2 meters, the reflection might appear as a point.

Wait, maybe I should recall the concept of the image formed by a plane mirror. A plane mirror forms an image that's the same size as the object, but it's a virtual image. So if the mirror is 2x2 mm, the image should also be 2x2 mm, but inverted. So when the screen is near, like 1 cm away, the image would be a rectangle (since the mirror is square but the reflection might maintain the same shape). But wait, no—because the light is coming from the sun, which is a distant source. So the reflection isn't creating an image but a beam.

Alternatively, when the light from the sun hits the mirror, it reflects as a beam. The shape of this beam when projected on a screen depends on the mirror's size and the distance. If the screen is close (1 cm), the beam would spread, and the illuminated area would be a circle (if the mirror were circular) or a rectangle (if it's square). But wait, no—wait, the mirror is square, but since it's a plane, the reflection would produce a rectangular spot on the screen when near, but when far away, the spot would be a point or a circle if it's focused. Wait, no, a plane mirror doesn't focus light; it just reflects it.

Wait, I'm getting mixed up. Let me think about it differently. For a plane mirror, the reflected light is parallel. So the intensity on the screen would depend on the solid angle. But the shape of the illuminated area... Hmm.

If the mirror is small, the reflected beam is a small rectangle because the mirror is square. Wait, but when the screen is near (1 cm), the beam would diverge, so the shape would be a rectangle. When the screen is far (2 meters), the beam would appear more like a point, but since it's a plane mirror, the spot might be a rectangle again, but perhaps at a distance, it's too small to notice the shape, but in reality, the shape depends on the mirror's size and the distance.

Wait, another approach: The reflection from a plane mirror creates a virtual image of the source. So if the sun is a point source, the image would be a point at the same distance behind the mirror. But the mirror isn't a point; it's 2x2 mm. So the image would be a square of the same size, 2x2 mm, because each point on the mirror reflects light to create the image.

Wait, but the sun is a distant source, so it's a parallel beam. So the reflected beam is also parallel, but each point on the mirror reflects a small part of the beam. So when the screen is close (1 cm), the light from the mirror would cover a small area, but the shape would depend on how the light spreads.

Wait, no, because the reflection from a plane mirror of a parallel beam is itself a parallel beam. So the light should be collimated, so on the screen, if it's close, the beam would spread out, creating a shape the same as the mirror but scaled. But wait, no, because the beam is parallel, so at any distance, it should project the same shape as the mirror, but perhaps scaled.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think about the concept of a plane mirror reflecting a collimated beam. If the mirror is small, the reflected beam is a small rectangle. So when the screen is near (1 cm), the illuminated area would be a rectangle because the beam is parallel, so it covers an area the same size as the mirror but at that distance. But wait, no, because when the mirror is small and the screen is at a certain distance, the light from each point on the mirror would spread, making a small circle for each point. Wait, perhaps it's more complicated.

Alternatively, consider geometric optics. The reflection of a plane mirror for a distant source (sun) would create a virtual image of the source behind the mirror. So the image would be a point if the source is a point. But the mirror is 2x2 mm, so perhaps the image is a square. Wait, no, if the mirror is a plane, the image would be the same as the source, but when the source is a distant point, the mirror would reflect it as a point image.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to visualize. If the sun is far away, the light rays are parallel. When they hit the plane mirror, they reflect as parallel rays, but in the opposite direction. So the reflected beam is a parallel beam. So when this beam hits a screen, the illuminated area would be a rectangle if the beam is spread out. But wait, if the beam is parallel, the intensity should be uniform across the screen, but the actual shape would depend on the width of the beam.

Wait, but the mirror is 2x2 mm, so the reflected beam would be a 2x2 mm rectangle of parallel light. So when the screen is placed 1 cm away, the beam would spread out. Wait, no, because the beam is parallel, it doesn't spread. So at any distance, the illuminated area would be the same as the mirror's size? No, that can't be right because when you move the screen closer, the beam would be focused or spread.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the concept of a "pupil" in optics. The mirror's size determines the diameter of the reflected beam. So a 2x2 mm mirror would reflect a 2x2 mm beam. So when the screen is close (1 cm), the beam would diverge, making a larger illuminated area, perhaps a circle. But wait, the mirror is square, so the illuminated area would be a square when the screen is close. Hmm, but that doesn't make sense because the beam is parallel, so the illuminated area should be a rectangle the same size as the mirror, regardless of distance.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about it differently. When a plane mirror reflects light from a distant source, the reflected light is collimated. So when the screen is at a certain distance, the beam would cover an area equal to the mirror's size. But that doesn't change with distance because the beam is parallel. So at 1 cm, the illuminated area would be a square (since the mirror is 2x2 mm), but that's only if the beam is focused. But wait, no, because the beam is parallel, so the illuminated area on the screen would be a rectangle of the same size as the mirror, regardless of distance. So for part (a), 1 cm away, it's a square. For part (b), 2 meters away, the same square. But that doesn't make sense because the options don't have both as square.

Wait, but looking at the options, the first part (a) could be square, and (b) could be circular. Hmm, maybe I'm wrong. Let me think again.

Alternatively, when the screen is close, the light from different points on the mirror spreads out, creating a larger area. The shape would be determined by the mirror's shape. Since the mirror is square, the illuminated area would be a square when the screen is close, but when the screen is far away, the spot becomes smaller, but perhaps it's a circle due to the optics. Wait, that doesn't make sense because the mirror is square, so the shape should remain square regardless of distance.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up reflection from a point source and a distant source. Let me clarify: When the source is a point (like a bulb), the reflection from a plane mirror would create a virtual image of the source behind the mirror, same size. But when the source is a distant source (like the sun), the reflection is a collimated beam. So the shape on the screen would be determined by the mirror's size when the screen is near, but when the screen is far, the beam is so spread out that it appears as a point, making the illuminated area a circle (due to diffraction, but perhaps we're assuming geometrical optics here).

Wait, but in geometrical optics, the beam is considered parallel, so if the mirror is 2x2 mm, the reflected beam is a 2x2 mm rectangle of parallel light. So when the screen is 1 cm away, the light would hit a 2x2 mm area, making a square. But when the screen is 2 meters away, the same 2x2 mm beam would hit a tiny 2x2 mm area, so the illuminated spot would be a square. But that's not matching any of the options where (a) is square and (b) is circular.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think about the nature of the reflection. The sun's rays are parallel, so the mirror reflects them as parallel rays. So the beam is a parallel beam. So when you place a screen near the mirror, the beam is a rectangle (same size as the mirror), but as you move the screen away, the beam remains a rectangle. So the shape should always be a rectangle, regardless of distance. But that doesn't fit the options either.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the setup. The mirror is reflecting light from the sun, which is at a large distance. So each point on the mirror reflects a small portion of the parallel beam. The screen is placed either close (1 cm) or far (2 meters). At 1 cm, the reflected light from each point on the mirror would diverge, creating a larger illuminated area. Since the mirror is square, the illuminated area would be a square. But wait, when the light spreads, wouldn't the shape be a circle? No, because the mirror is square, the spread would be in all directions, but perhaps the shape would be a circle if the spread is isotropic. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused between geometrical and physical optics.

Wait, let me think again. If the mirror is a point, the reflection would be a point. But since the mirror is a square, the reflection would be a square. So when the screen is close, the illuminated area would be a square. When the screen is far, the beam is so spread out that the illuminated area is a circle because the light from the mirror spreads out in all directions, making the spot round. But that doesn't make sense because the mirror is square, so the spread should maintain the square shape.

Alternatively, perhaps when the screen is close, the reflection is a square, and when it's far, it's a circle. But that seems contradictory.

Wait, maybe I should think about the concept of a "spot size." In geometric optics, the spot size after reflection from a mirror depends on the mirror's size and the distance. For a plane mirror, if the screen is near, the spot is the same size as the mirror. If the screen is far, the spot is smaller. But that can't be right because for a parallel beam, the spot size doesn't change with distance. So perhaps I'm wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the correct approach is to realize that when the screen is close, the beam is divergent, so the illuminated area is a square, and when the screen is far, the beam is more collimated, making the spot a circle. Wait, but how? If the mirror is square, the reflection would always be a square. Unless the light spreads out in a circular pattern due to the optics.

Wait, perhaps the answer is that at 1 cm, the shape is a square, and at 2 meters, it's a circle. But looking at the options, option B says (a) square, (b) circular. That would make sense if that's the case.

So, the reasoning is: when the screen is close (1 cm), the reflected light from the square mirror creates a square spot. When the screen is far (2 meters), the reflected beam is so spread out that the spot becomes circular. But wait, that doesn't make sense because the mirror is square, so the spread should maintain the square shape. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps when the mirror is small compared to the distance, the spot becomes circular due to the light spreading out in all directions, making a circle. But if the mirror is square, the shape should still be square. I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, maybe another approach: The reflection from a plane mirror of a point source creates a virtual image. So if the source is a point, the image is a point. But the sun is a distant point source, so the image would be a point at the same distance behind the mirror as the source. But the mirror is 2x2 mm, so perhaps the image is a square? No, that doesn't fit because the image of a point source should be a point.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think in terms of the problem. The mirror is 2x2 mm. When the screen is close, the reflection would be a square. When it's far, the reflection would be a circle because the light spreads out more, creating a circular spot. So option B would be (a) square, (b) circular.

So the answer should be option B: (a) square, (b) circular.

The problem involves determining the shape of the illuminated area on a screen when light from the sun is reflected off a small plane mirror (2 mm × 2 mm). The screen is placed at two distances: (a) 1 cm and (b) 2 meters away from the mirror.

When the sun, a distant source, illuminates the mirror, the reflected light forms a collimated beam due to the parallel nature of sunlight. The shape of the illuminated area on the screen depends on the distance of the screen from the mirror:

1. **At 1 cm (close distance):**  
   The reflected light from the small square mirror spreads out slightly, creating an illuminated area on the screen. Since the mirror is square, the illuminated area is also square.

2. **At 2 meters (far distance):**  
   At a much greater distance, the reflected light spreads out more, and the illuminated area becomes circular due to the spreading nature of the light beam.

Thus, the shapes of the illuminated areas are:  
(a) Square (1 cm away) and (b) Circular (2 meters away).

**Answer:** B
