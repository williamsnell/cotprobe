Okay, so I've got this genetics question here about X-linked recessive disorders and Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Hmm, I remember that X-linked recessive disorders are ones where the defective gene is on the X chromosome. Since males have only one X (from their mother), they express the disorder if they inherit the defective gene. Females, on the other hand, have two X's, so they need two copies of the defective gene to show the disorder.

The question says the incidence in males is 1 in 100. So that means the carrier frequency for the recessive allele is 1/100. Wait, but in Hardy-Weinberg, the frequency of the recessive allele (q) is equal to the incidence in males because males only have one X. So q = 1/100.

Now, the question is about the expected incidence of affected homozygous females. Affected females would be those with two recessive alleles, so their genotype is X^a X^a. The probability of a female being affected is q squared, right? Because each X must carry the recessive allele.

So let me compute that. q is 1/100, so q squared is (1/100)^2 = 1/10000. Wait, but wait a second. I think I might be mixing up the Hardy-Weinberg equations. For X-linked recessive, the females' genotypes are X^A X^A, X^A X^a, and X^a X^a. The frequencies are p², 2pq, and q² respectively. So the frequency of affected females is q².

If q is 1/100, then q² is 1/10,000. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me make sure. The incidence in males is 1 in 100, so q is 0.01. So q squared is 0.0001, which is 1/10000. So the incidence of affected females should be 1 in 10,000. But wait, looking at the options, option A is 1 in 10,000. So that's the expected answer.

Wait, but wait another thought. Sometimes, for X-linked recessive diseases, the carrier females (heterozygous) are much more common, but affected females are rare. So yes, the math checks out. So the answer should be A: 1 in 10,000.

The incidence of the X-linked recessive disorder in males is 1 in 100, meaning the recessive allele frequency \( q = \frac{1}{100} \). For females to be affected, they must inherit two recessive alleles, so the frequency of affected females is \( q^2 = \left(\frac{1}{100}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{10,000} \). Thus, the expected incidence of affected homozygous females is 1 in 10,000.

Answer: A
