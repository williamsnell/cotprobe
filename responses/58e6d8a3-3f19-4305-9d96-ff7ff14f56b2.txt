Question:

A boy who is holding a suitcase stands in an elevator. The elevator has an acceleration A^\ding{217}, which may be directed upward (A^\ding{217}. positive) or downward (A^\ding{217} negative). What force does the suitcase exert on the boy's hand?

Options:

A: A/(mg)
B: m(g + A)
C: m(A/g)
D: mg/A

H: mg + A
I: A/mg
J: m(g/A)

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. So, there's a boy holding a suitcase in an elevator, and the elevator has an acceleration A with a direction—positive if upward and negative if downward. The question is asking about the force that the suitcase exerts on the boy's hand.

Hmm, I remember from my classes that when you're dealing with forces in elevators, you have to consider the apparent weight. Apparent weight is different from actual weight because it changes based on the motion of the elevator. The actual weight is mg, right? But when the elevator accelerates, the apparent weight changes.

So, when the elevator is accelerating upward, the apparent weight increases, making the suitcase feel heavier. Conversely, if the elevator accelerates downward, the apparent weight decreases, making it feel lighter. But wait, if the acceleration is downward and greater than g, the suitcase would feel weightless or even negative, but in this problem, I think the acceleration is such that the suitcase is still being held, so maybe the acceleration isn't so extreme.

The force the suitcase exerts on the boy's hand is the normal force. From what I remember, the normal force here is the apparent weight, which is what the boy feels. So the formula for apparent weight is N = m(g + a), where a is the acceleration of the elevator. But wait, I should double-check the signs because sometimes it's easy to get confused with the direction.

Wait, let me think again. If the elevator is accelerating upward, a is positive, so the apparent weight increases. If it's accelerating downward, a is negative, so the apparent weight would be m(g - |a|). But wait, the formula might be better represented as N = m(g + a), where a is the acceleration. Because when the elevator accelerates upward, the acceleration a is positive, so N increases. If the elevator accelerates downward, a is negative, so N = m(g - a), but wait, no—because if a is negative, say a = -A where A is positive, then N = m(g + (-A)) = m(g - A). Hmm, that makes sense.

But wait, in the problem statement, the acceleration is given as A, which could be positive (up) or negative (down). So the formula would be N = m(g + A). Because if A is positive (elevator accelerating up), then N is greater than mg. If A is negative (elevator accelerating down), then N is less than mg.

Wait, wait a minute. Let me make sure. The force exerted by the suitcase on the boy's hand is the normal force, which is equal in magnitude to the apparent weight. So the boy feels this normal force as the weight of the suitcase. So the formula should be N = m(g + a), where a is the elevator's acceleration.

Looking at the options, option B is m(g + A), which matches this formula. Option F is m(g - A), which would be the case if the acceleration were upward, but that's not correct. Because if a is positive, N increases. So B is correct.

Wait, but wait another thing. If the elevator is accelerating upward, the apparent weight is more than mg, so the boy has to exert more force to hold the suitcase. If the elevator accelerates downward, the apparent weight is less, but if the acceleration is greater than g, the suitcase would actually float, but the problem states that the boy is holding it, so maybe A isn't greater than g. But the formula should still hold regardless.

So the correct answer should be option B: m(g + A).

The force the suitcase exerts on the boy's hand is the normal force, which corresponds to the apparent weight. The apparent weight is given by \( N = m(g + A) \), where \( A \) is the elevator's acceleration. This accounts for both upward and downward accelerations. Therefore, the correct answer is:

B: \( m(g + A) \)

Answer: B
