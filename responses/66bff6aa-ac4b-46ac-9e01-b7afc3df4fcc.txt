Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this problem about coloring edges in a complete graph. The question is asking for the smallest number of vertices, n, such that if every edge is colored either red or blue, there must be a 4-clique (which is a complete subgraph of 4 vertices) that's all red or all blue. The options given are from A to J, with numbers ranging from 8 to 22. 

First, I remember this is related to Ramsey numbers. Ramsey theory deals with conditions under which order must appear. Specifically, the Ramsey number R(s, t) is the smallest number n such that any red-blue coloring of the edges of a complete graph on n vertices contains a red s-clique or a blue t-clique. So in this case, we're looking for R(4,4), the smallest n where either a red 4-clique or a blue 4-clique is guaranteed.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure if it's exactly R(4,4). Let me think. The problem is about a 4-clique in either color, so yes, R(4,4) is the number we need. Now, I need to recall what R(4,4) is. I remember that Ramsey numbers are tricky because they're not known for all values, but some small ones are established.

I think R(3,3) is 6, which means that in any 2-coloring of a complete graph with 6 vertices, there's a monochromatic triangle. But for R(4,4), I'm less sure. I think it's 18, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe it's 17 or 19? Wait, no, I think I've heard that R(4,4) is 18, but I'm not 100% confident. Let me try to reason it out.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the recursive formula for Ramsey numbers. The general formula is R(s, t) ≤ R(s-1, t) + R(s, t-1). But that's more of an upper bound, and it doesn't give exact values always. For specific cases, like R(4,4), I think the known value is 18. Wait, or is it higher? I might be mixing it up with other numbers.

Wait, another approach: Turán's theorem. Turán's theorem gives the maximum number of edges a graph can have without containing a complete subgraph of a certain size. Maybe I can use that to find the minimal n where a monochromatic 4-clique is unavoidable.

Turán's theorem says that the maximum number of edges in an n-vertex graph without a (r+1)-clique is given by the Turán graph, which is a complete r-partite graph with partitions as equal as possible. So for avoiding a 4-clique, r would be 3, and the Turán graph T(n,3) is a complete 3-partite graph with each partition as equal as possible.

But how does that help with edge colorings? Well, if we can calculate the maximum number of edges that can be colored without forming a 4-clique in either color, then n would be one more than that. Wait, maybe that's not directly applicable.

Alternatively, considering that each edge is colored red or blue, to avoid a red 4-clique, the red graph must be 3-clique-free, and similarly for blue. So maybe each color's graph must be a Turán graph without a 4-clique, i.e., each color's graph has at most the Turán number for 4-clique-free graphs.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to think differently. Suppose we have a graph with n vertices, and each edge is red or blue. We want the minimal n where in any such coloring, there's a red 4-clique or a blue 4-clique.

So the question is, what's the minimal n such that R(4,4) ≤ n. I think R(4,4) is known to be 18. So the answer would be 18, which is option J.

But wait, another thought: Maybe I'm remembering R(5,5) as 43 or something, and R(4,4) is 18. Let me try to recall. I think R(4,4) is indeed 18. So the answer is J:18.

The question asks for the smallest number of vertices, n, such that any 2-coloring of the edges of a complete graph on n vertices guarantees a monochromatic 4-clique (either all red or all blue). This is related to the Ramsey number R(4,4), which is the smallest n with this property. After considering Ramsey theory and known values, R(4,4) is established as 18. Therefore, the smallest n that guarantees a 4-clique in either red or blue is 18.

Answer: J
