Okay, so I need to figure out the key characteristics of transactional leaders. Hmm, I remember from my studies that there are different leadership styles, like transactional, transformational, etc. Transactional leaders are known for a more structured approach, right? They focus on clear roles and tasks.

I think they usually set clear goals and expect their team members to follow procedures. They might use rewards and punishments to motivate employees. So, their main traits are probably about guiding, commanding, and motivating. Let me go through the options.

Option A: Guiding, demonstrating, motivating. Well, guiding and motivating make sense, but demonstrating? I'm not sure if that's the main thing for transactional leaders. They might set an example, but I think they rely more on clear instructions.

Option B: Guiding, commanding, motivating. This seems closer. Commanding fits because they give clear orders. Guiding and motivating are also part of their style. They want the team to follow their lead and stay motivated through rewards.

Option C: Demonstrating, mentoring, guiding. Mentoring sounds more like a transformational leader, who develops the team's potential. Transactional leaders are more about the task than mentoring.

Option D: Guiding, mentoring, motivating. Again, mentoring doesn't fit as well. It's more about day-to-day tasks rather than developing people's skills.

Option E: Mentoring, demonstrating, commanding. Mentoring is still off. They might command, but mentoring isn't a key trait.

Option F: Demonstrating, commanding, guiding. Demonstrating could be part of it, but I'm not as confident. Commanding and guiding are definitely there.

Option G: Guiding, commanding, demonstrating. Similar to F, but maybe it's the same points.

Option H: Commanding, mentoring, motivating. Mentoring again, which I don't think is right.

Option I: Commanding, demonstrating, motivating. This includes commanding and motivating, which fit. Demonstrating might be part of it, but I'm not sure if it's the key characteristic.

Option J: Guiding, mentoring, demonstrating. Mentoring again, which I don't think is transactional.

So, going back, transactional leaders are task-oriented, set clear expectations, give commands, and use rewards to motivate. So their characteristics should include guiding (providing direction), commanding (issuing orders), and motivating through incentives.

Looking again, option B is guiding, commanding, and motivating. That seems to fit. Option I is commanding, demonstrating, motivating. Hmm, but I think demonstrating is more about leading by example, which might be more transformational. So, maybe B is better.

Wait, another thought: transactional leaders focus on the present, ensuring tasks are done correctly. They might not demonstrate as much as they command. So yes, B makes sense.
