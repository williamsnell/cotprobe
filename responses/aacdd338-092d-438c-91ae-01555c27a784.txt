Okay, so I've got this history question here about Hernando de Soto and the people he encountered. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that Hernando de Soto was a Spanish explorer who led an expedition in the 16th century. He's known for exploring parts of what is now the southeastern United States. I think he came into contact with Native American groups during his travels.

Now, the question is asking about the direct descendants of the people he met. So I need to figure out which of these options are groups that were present in the areas he visited and whose descendants are still around today.

Looking at the options:

A: Mayan. The Maya were primarily in Central America, like in present-day Mexico, Belize, Guatemala, and Honduras. De Soto was in the southeastern U.S., so probably not the Maya.

B: Kwakiutl. They're a group from the Pacific Northwest, like in Canada and the northern U.S. De Soto was in the south, so not likely.

C: Mississippian. Mississippian culture was widespread in the southeast and Mississippi River area. They were an advanced civilization with large mounds, and I think their descendants are ancestors of some modern tribes. This seems possible.

D: Inca. The Inca were in South America, mostly in Peru. De Soto was in North America, so this doesn't fit.

E: Clovis. Clovis culture refers to the early Paleoindian period, around 12,000 years ago. They were big game hunters. But by de Soto's time (1500s), they would have long been gone, replaced by other cultures. So probably not.

F: Aztec. The Aztecs were in central Mexico. Again, not in the southeast where de Soto was.

G: Ancestral Puebloan. They're also known as the Anasazi, and they lived in the Southwest, like in Arizona and New Mexico. De Soto was in the southeast, so not this group.

H: Hopewell. Hopewell culture was in the eastern woodlands, including parts of Ohio and other mid-east areas. They were known for their mounds and trade networks. But I'm not sure if they were the ones de Soto encountered. I think the Mississippian culture was more prominent where de Soto was.

I: Olmec. They were an early Mesoamerican culture in Mexico. Probably not relevant to the southeast U.S.

J: Adena. Adena culture was also in the Ohio Valley, similar to Hopewell. So again, perhaps not where de Soto was.

So narrowing it down, the Mississippian (C) and Hopewell (H) are possibilities. But I think the Mississippian culture was more prominent in the areas de Soto explored. Also, the Mississippian people were known for their city-states and mounds, which would have been impressive and likely what de Soto and his men encountered.

Wait, but Hopewell's timeline was earlier, like around 1000 BCE to 500 CE, while Mississippian was from about 800 CE to 1600 CE. Since de Soto was in the 16th century, Mississippian would still be active, whereas Hopewell had already declined.

So the answer is probably C: Mississippian.

The correct answer is C: Mississippian. Hernando de Soto encountered the Mississippian people during his exploration of the southeastern United States in the 16th century. The Mississippian culture was prominent in the region and is known for its advanced city-states and mound-building. Their descendants are ancestors of various modern Native American tribes in the area.

Answer: C
