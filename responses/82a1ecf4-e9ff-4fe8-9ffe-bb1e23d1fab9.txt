Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about the quantity theory of money. The question is asking what happens when you increase the money supply according to this theory. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that the quantity theory of money is a model that explains the relationship between the money supply, price levels, and output. The basic idea is that in the long run, increasing the money supply doesn't affect real variables like output or employment because people adjust their expectations over time. Instead, it mainly affects nominal variables like the price level, leading to inflation.

So the equation I recall is MV = PT, where M is money supply, V is the velocity of money, P is the price level, and T is real transactions or output. If M increases and V is constant, then PT must increase. In the short run, T might increase a bit because prices haven't adjusted yet, so output could go up. But in the long run, T adjusts, so P increases and output goes back to its original level.

Looking at the options:

A: Increase long-run output with no significant impact on inflation. Hmm, no, because in the long run, output doesn't change; inflation does.

B: No impact on output or inflation. That doesn't sound right because in the short run, output might rise, and inflation would come later.

C: Lower unemployment while lowering inflation. Doesn't fit; increasing money supply usually leads to inflation, not lower inflation.

D: Increase short-run output but source of long-run inflation. This sounds closer. Short-term boost in output, and over time, inflation occurs.

E: Increase long-run capacity. No, capacity is about production potential, which doesn't change with money supply.

F: Stimulate long-run production with short-run inflation. Wait, no, the long run doesn't see output changes, and short-run inflation would follow.

G: Decrease inflation, no impact on output. Opposite of what happens; increasing money supply increases inflation.

H: Stimulate short-run production, little long-run inflation. Maybe, but I think the long-run inflation is significant, not little.

I: Increase unemployment and inflation. Doesn't make sense; more money usually reduces unemployment in the short run.

J: Decrease output in short run and inflation in long run. No, that's the opposite of what I remember.

So D seems to fit: increasing money supply leads to higher short-term output but causes inflation in the long run.

The quantity theory of money suggests that increasing the money supply primarily affects nominal variables like the price level (inflation) rather than real variables like output or employment in the long run. In the short run, output might increase as prices haven't fully adjusted, but in the long run, inflation rises without a sustained increase in output. Therefore, the correct answer is:

D: increase short-run output but it is the source of long-run inflation.

Answer: D
