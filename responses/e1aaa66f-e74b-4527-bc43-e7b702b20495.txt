Okay, so I've got this problem here about buying a motorcycle on installment. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with finance calculations, but I'll take it slow.

Alright, the motorcycle costs $275 in cash. But if you buy it on installment, you have to put down 10% as a down payment and then pay $18.20 each month for 18 months. The question is asking for two things: the finance charge and the percentage by which the installment price exceeds the cash price, both to the nearest tenth of a percent.

First, I think I need to calculate the total amount paid through the installment plan. Let me break it down.

The down payment is 10% of $275. So, 10% of 275 is... hmm, 10% is easy, that's just 27.5. So the down payment is $27.50.

Now, the monthly payments are $18.20 for 18 months. To find the total of those payments, I'll multiply 18.20 by 18. Let me do that calculation. 18 times 18 is 324, but wait, that's without the decimal. Let me think again. 18.20 times 18. Maybe I can break it down: 10 times 18.20 is 182, and 8 times 18.20 is 145.60. Adding those together, 182 + 145.60 equals 327.60. So the total monthly payments are $327.60.

Now, add the down payment to the monthly payments to get the total installment price. So $327.60 plus $27.50. Let me add those. 327.60 + 27.50 = 355.10. So the total amount paid is $355.10.

Wait, the cash price is $275, so the finance charge should be the difference between the installment total and the cash price. So 355.10 minus 275. Let me subtract that. 355.10 - 275 = 80.10. So the finance charge is $80.10.

Okay, so looking at the options, I see that option J is $80.10. But I also need to find the percentage by which the installment exceeds the cash price. So that's (finance charge / cash price) times 100 to get the percentage.

So, finance charge is 80.10, cash price is 275. So 80.10 divided by 275. Let me calculate that. Hmm, 80.10 / 275. Let me see, 275 goes into 80.10 how many times? Well, 275 times 0.29 is about 79.75 (because 0.29 * 275 = 79.75). So 80.10 is a little more than 0.29, maybe around 0.291 or so. Let me do the division properly.

80.10 รท 275 = ?

Let me convert this into a decimal. 275 goes into 801.0 how many times? 275*2=550, 275*3=825 which is too much. So 2 times, which is 550. Subtract 550 from 801, that leaves 251. Bring down a zero: 2510.

275 goes into 2510 about 9 times because 275*9=2475. Subtract that, 2510-2475=35. Bring down a zero, making it 350.

275 goes into 350 once (275*1=275). Subtract, 350-275=75. Bring down a zero: 750.

275 goes into 750 two times (275*2=550). Subtract: 750-550=200. Bring down a zero: 2000.

275 goes into 2000 seven times (275*7=1925). Subtract: 2000-1925=75. Wait, this looks like it's starting to repeat. Let me add up the decimals I have so far.

So 80.10 รท 275 = 0.2912... So approximately 29.12%. The question asks for the nearest tenth of a percent, so that's 29.1%.

Looking back at the options, option J is $80.10 and 29.1%, which matches both the finance charge and the percentage. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculations.

Wait, another way to check: 275 * 0.291 = 275 * 0.29 + 275 * 0.001. 0.29*275 is 79.75, and 0.001*275 is 0.275, so total is 79.75 + 0.275 = 80.025, which is approximately 80.03. Since the finance charge is $80.10, the percentage is about 29.1%, so J is correct.

Wait, but looking at the options again, option J is $80.10 and 29.1%, which seems to fit. But let me double-check my monthly payment total.

Wait, 18.20 per month for 18 months: 18.20 * 18. Let me calculate that again. 18 * 18 is 324, but since it's 18.20, maybe I should do 18.20 * 18.

Let me compute 18 * 18.20: 10 * 18.20 = 182, 8 * 18.20 = 145.60. Adding those gives 182 + 145.60 = 327.60. Yes, that's correct. Then add the down payment: 327.60 +27.50 = 355.10. So total installment is 355.10, cash price is 275, so difference is 80.10. So yes, finance charge is 80.10, and the percentage is 80.10/275 = ~29.1%.

So the correct answer should be J: $80.10, 29.1%.

The total amount paid through the installment plan is calculated by adding the down payment and the monthly payments. The down payment is 10% of $275, which is $27.50. The monthly payments of $18.20 for 18 months total $327.60. Adding these gives a total installment price of $355.10. The finance charge is the difference between this total and the cash price, which is $80.10. To find the percentage, divide the finance charge by the cash price: $80.10 / $275 = 0.2912, or 29.1% when rounded to the nearest tenth of a percent.
