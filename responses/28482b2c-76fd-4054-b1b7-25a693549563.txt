The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

All of the following are true regarding the function of neurons EXCEPT:

Options:

A: The refractory period prevents the neuron from initiating a new action potential.
B: The transmitting neuron secretes neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft from its dendrites.
C: An action potential is initiated when the axon hillock reaches the threshold potential.
D: The action potential travels along the axon away from the cell body.
E: Hyperpolarization occurs when the membrane potential becomes more negative than the resting potential.
F: The flow of sodium into the neuron depolarizes the membrane in the first phase of an action potential.
G: Hyperpolarization at the end of an action potential is one mechanism by which neurons limit the rate at which action potentials may fire.
H: The neuron releases neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft from the axon terminals.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about neurons, and I need to figure out which statement is false. Let's take it step by step.

The question is asking which of the options A through J is not true regarding the function of neurons. So I need to go through each option and check if it's correct or not.

Starting with option A: "The refractory period prevents the neuron from initiating a new action potential." I remember that the refractory period is a time after an action potential during which a neuron cannot fire again. It's like a cooldown period where the ion channels are recovering. So A is true.

Option B: "The transmitting neuron secretes neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft from its dendrites." Wait, I thought neurotransmitters are released from the axon terminals, which are part of the presynaptic neuron. Dendrites are the branched parts that receive signals, not send them. So B sounds incorrect. That might be the answer, but let me check others.

Option C: "An action potential is initiated when the axon hillock reaches the threshold potential." Yes, the axon hillock is where the action potential starts when the depolarization reaches a certain threshold. So C is correct.

Option D: "The action potential travels along the axon away from the cell body." Right, action potentials move along the axon towards the terminals, so D is true.

Option E: "Hyperpolarization occurs when the membrane potential becomes more negative than the resting potential." Hyperpolarization is indeed when the membrane potential is more negative than the resting state, which usually happens after the action potential. So E is correct.

Option F: "The flow of sodium into the neuron depolarizes the membrane in the first phase of an action potential." Sodium influx during the rising phase of the action potential causes depolarization, so F is true.

Option G: "Hyperpolarization at the end of an action potential is one mechanism by which neurons limit the rate at which action potentials may fire." Yes, hyperpolarization makes it harder for another action potential to start quickly, limiting the firing rate. So G is correct.

Option H: "The neuron releases neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft from the axon terminals." That's correct because axon terminals are where the synaptic vesicles release neurotransmitters.

So, looking back, option B says the transmitting neuron (presynaptic) secretes from its dendrites, which is wrong. Dendrites receive signals, not send neurotransmitters. So B is the false statement. Therefore, the answer should be B.

The answer is B because neurotransmitters are released from axon terminals, not dendrites.
