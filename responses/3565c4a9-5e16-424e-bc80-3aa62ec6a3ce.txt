Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I need to figure out the interval for all u such that neither 2u nor -20u is in the interval (-∞, -1). Hmm, that's a bit confusing at first, but let's break it down step by step.

First, I think I need to understand what the question is asking. It's saying that for a number u, when I multiply it by 2 (so 2u) or by -20 (so -20u), neither of those results should fall into the interval from negative infinity to -1. So, I need to find all u where both 2u and -20u are not less than -1.

Wait, so neither 2u nor -20u should be in (-∞, -1). That means both 2u and -20u must be greater than or equal to -1. Because if they're in (-∞, -1), that's bad, so we want them to be outside of that, which would be ≥ -1.

So, let's write that down as two separate inequalities:

1. 2u ≥ -1
2. -20u ≥ -1

I'll solve each of these inequalities to find the range of u that satisfies both.

Starting with the first one: 2u ≥ -1. If I divide both sides by 2, I get u ≥ -1/2. So u must be greater than or equal to -0.5.

Now the second inequality: -20u ≥ -1. Hmm, when I divide both sides by -20, I have to remember that dividing by a negative number reverses the inequality sign. So, u ≤ (-1)/(-20), which simplifies to u ≤ 1/20. Because -1 divided by -20 is positive 1/20.

Wait, let me double-check that. If I have -20u ≥ -1, then dividing both sides by -20, which is negative, flips the inequality. So, u ≤ (-1)/(-20) → u ≤ 1/20. Yes, that's correct.

So putting both inequalities together, u must satisfy both u ≥ -1/2 and u ≤ 1/20. So the interval for u is from -1/2 to 1/20, including the endpoints.

Wait, but looking at the options, let me see which one matches this interval. The options are:

A: [-2, -1/2]
B: [0, 1/2]
C: [-1/20, 0]
D: [-1/2, 0]
E: [-1, 0]
F: [1/20, 1/2]
G: [-1,1]
H: [0,2]
I: [1,2]
J: [-1/2, -1/20]

Wait a second, J is [-1/2, -1/20]. That's from -0.5 to -0.05, but according to my calculations, u should be between -0.5 and 0.05 (since 1/20 is 0.05). So the interval is from -0.5 to 0.05, which is [-1/2, 1/20]. But looking at the options, J is from -1/2 to -1/20, which is negative on both ends, up to -0.05. But my upper limit is positive 0.05, which is 1/20.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check again.

The inequalities are:

1. 2u ≥ -1 → u ≥ -1/2 (so u ≥ -0.5)
2. -20u ≥ -1 → u ≤ 1/20 (u ≤ 0.05)

So u must be between -0.5 and 0.05, inclusive. So the interval is [-0.5, 0.05], which is in fractions: [-1/2, 1/20]. But looking at the options, none of them directly say that. The closest is option J, which is [-1/2, -1/20], but that's from -0.5 to -0.05, which is entirely negative. But according to me, u can also be positive up to 0.05.

Wait, perhaps I did something wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, the second inequality: -20u ≥ -1. So, solving for u:

-20u ≥ -1
Divide both sides by -20, which flips the inequality:
u ≤ (-1)/(-20) → u ≤ 1/20.

So u ≤ 0.05.

So u can be any number from as low as -0.5 (from first inequality) up to 0.05.

So the interval is u ∈ [-1/2, 1/20]. But looking at the options, none of them directly say that. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A: [-2, -1/2] → from -2 to -0.5

B: [0, 1/2] → from 0 to 0.5

C: [-1/20, 0] → from -0.05 to 0

D: [-1/2, 0] → from -0.5 to 0

E: [-1, 0] → from -1 to 0

F: [1/20, 1/2] → from 0.05 to 0.5

G: [-1,1] → from -1 to 1

H: [0,2] → from 0 to 2

I: [1,2] → from 1 to 2

J: [-1/2, -1/20] → from -0.5 to -0.05

Wait, so none of the options include both negative and positive up to 0.05. The only option that includes part of this is J, but J only goes up to -0.05. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the problem is about the interval where both 2u and -20u are NOT in (-∞, -1). So, for 2u not to be less than -1, and similarly for -20u not to be less than -1.

Wait, perhaps I should write the conditions differently. Let's think again.

We don't want 2u ∈ (-∞, -1), which implies 2u ≥ -1 → u ≥ -1/2.

Similarly, we don't want -20u ∈ (-∞, -1), which implies -20u ≥ -1 → u ≤ 1/20.

So the acceptable u must satisfy both u ≥ -1/2 and u ≤ 1/20. So u ∈ [-1/2, 1/20].

But looking at the options, none of them have 1/20 as the upper limit. The closest is J, which is from -1/2 to -1/20, which is only the negative part. Alternatively, perhaps I misread the options. Let me check again.

Wait, option J is [-1/2, -1/20], which is from -0.5 to -0.05. But according to my calculation, u can be up to 0.05, which is positive. So none of the options seem to match. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the inequalities. Let me think again.

We want neither 2u nor -20u to be in (-∞, -1). So:

For 2u not to be in (-∞, -1): 2u ≥ -1 → u ≥ -1/2.

For -20u not to be in (-∞, -1): So, -20u ≥ -1 → u ≤ 1/20.

So u must be ≥ -1/2 and ≤ 1/20. So the interval is u ∈ [-1/2, 1/20].

But none of the options match this exactly. The options given are A-J, and I don't see an option that goes from -1/2 to 1/20. Wait, looking back:

Wait, option J is [-1/2, -1/20], which is the negative part, but up to -0.05, which is less than 1/20 (0.05). So perhaps the correct interval is from -1/2 to 1/20, but that's not an option. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the cases where 2u and -20u are both not less than -1. So, 2u ≥ -1 and -20u ≥ -1.

Which gives u ≥ -1/2 and u ≤ 1/20. So the intersection is from -1/2 to 1/20.

But the options don't include that. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. It says "the interval consists of all u such that neither 2u nor -20u is in (-∞, -1)". So both 2u and -20u must be ≥ -1.

So 2u ≥ -1 → u ≥ -1/2.

-20u ≥ -1 → u ≤ 1/20.

So the interval is u ∈ [-1/2, 1/20].

Looking at the options again, I don't see this interval. Wait, perhaps I misread the options. Let me check again.

Option J is [-1/2, -1/20], which is from -0.5 to -0.05. That's only the negative part of my interval. So perhaps the correct answer is J, but that would only cover u from -0.5 to -0.05. But according to my calculation, u can also be from -0.05 up to 0.05 (since 1/20 is 0.05). So maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that when u is positive, let's see:

If u is positive, say u = 0.05, then 2u = 0.1 (which is ≥ -1, so that's good). And -20u = -1, which is exactly -1, so it's not less than -1. So that's acceptable.

If u is 0.06, which is greater than 1/20, then -20u = -1.2, which is less than -1, so that's not acceptable. So u must be ≤ 1/20.

Similarly, if u is less than -1/2, say u = -0.6, then 2u = -1.2, which is less than -1, so that's bad. So u must be ≥ -1/2.

So the interval is from -1/2 to 1/20, which is [-0.5, 0.05].

Looking back at the options, the only option that includes part of this interval is J, which is [-1/2, -1/20], but that only covers from -0.5 to -0.05. So perhaps the answer is J, but I'm confused because my calculation includes positive u up to 0.05, which isn't covered by any option except maybe none. But that can't be right.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in translating the inequalities. Let me try again.

The problem says neither 2u nor -20u is in (-∞, -1). So both 2u and -20u must be ≥ -1.

So:

2u ≥ -1 → u ≥ -1/2.

-20u ≥ -1 → u ≤ 1/20.

So u must be ≥ -1/2 and ≤ 1/20. So the interval is [-1/2, 1/20].

Looking at the options, I don't see this interval. The closest is J: [-1/2, -1/20], but that's only up to -0.05. So maybe the correct answer is J, but I'm not sure why.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the second inequality. Let me check:

-20u ≥ -1 → u ≤ (-1)/(-20) → u ≤ 1/20. Yes, that's correct. So u can be up to 1/20, which is positive. So the interval includes from -1/2 to 1/20, which is a mix of negative and positive numbers.

But none of the options include both. So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but that can't be the case. Maybe I made a mistake in the problem setup.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the problem is asking for the interval where both 2u and -20u are not in (-∞, -1). So, that means both 2u and -20u are ≥ -1.

So, 2u ≥ -1 → u ≥ -1/2.

-20u ≥ -1 → u ≤ 1/20.

So the u's that satisfy both are in [-1/2, 1/20]. But again, this interval isn't listed as an option. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the problem is to find the interval where both 2u and -20u are not in (-∞, -1). So, neither 2u nor -20u is less than -1. So, 2u ≥ -1 and -20u ≥ -1.

Which again gives u ≥ -1/2 and u ≤ 1/20. So the interval is [-1/2, 1/20].

But since this interval isn't among the options, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the question. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is looking for the interval where either 2u or -20u is not in (-∞, -1), but that's not what the question says. The question says neither, so both must be outside.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the union of the two conditions. Let me think differently. Maybe the interval is where either 2u is not less than -1 or -20u is not less than -1. But that's a different interpretation, and the question says neither, so both must satisfy.

Wait, perhaps I should visualize this on a number line. Let's plot u on a line.

For 2u ≥ -1: u ≥ -0.5.

For -20u ≥ -1: u ≤ 0.05.

So the overlap is from -0.5 to 0.05.

But none of the options include this. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the interval where both 2u and -20u are ≥ -1, which is what I did.

Wait, maybe the problem is to find the interval where 2u is not in (-∞, -1) and -20u is not in (-∞, -1). So both must be ≥ -1.

So, 2u ≥ -1 → u ≥ -0.5.

-20u ≥ -1 → u ≤ 0.05.

So the interval is [-0.5, 0.05], which is [-1/2, 1/20]. But since this isn't an option, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, looking back at the options, option J is [-1/2, -1/20], which is from -0.5 to -0.05. That's part of the interval I found, but only the negative part. So perhaps the correct answer is J, but I'm not sure why.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the interval where 2u is not in (-∞, -1) or -20u is not in (-∞, -1). But that would be the union, which would be u ≤ 0.05 or u ≥ -0.5, which is not correct because that's all real numbers except between -0.5 and 0.05. But that's not the case here.

Wait, the problem says "neither 2u nor -20u is in (-∞, -1)", which means both must be outside. So I think my initial approach is correct.

Wait, perhaps the answer is J because it's the only option that includes part of the correct interval, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the second inequality.

Wait, let me re-examine the second inequality: -20u ≥ -1.

Dividing both sides by -20 (negative) flips the inequality, so u ≤ 1/20.

Yes, that's correct. So u must be ≤ 0.05.

So the interval is from -0.5 to 0.05. But none of the options match this. So perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I misread the options. Let me check again:

Option J is [-1/2, -1/20], which is from -0.5 to -0.05.

Option D is [-1/2, 0], which is from -0.5 to 0.

Option C is [-1/20, 0], from -0.05 to 0.

Option B is [0, 1/2], from 0 to 0.5.

Wait, perhaps the correct interval is the union of D and F? No, that's not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find u such that 2u is not less than -1 and -20u is not less than -1. So, u ≥ -1/2 and u ≤ 1/20. So the interval is from -1/2 to 1/20.

But since this isn't an option, perhaps I'm making a mistake elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that when u is positive, -20u is negative, but not necessarily less than -1. For example, if u is 0.05, -20u = -1, which is the boundary. If u is 0.04, -20u = -0.8, which is greater than -1. So that's acceptable.

So the upper limit is u ≤ 1/20.

Similarly, when u is negative, 2u must be ≥ -1, so u ≥ -1/2.

So the interval is from -1/2 to 1/20. But again, no option matches.

Wait, perhaps the problem is to find where both 2u and -20u are ≥ -1, which is what I did.

Wait, maybe the answer is J because it's the only option that starts at -1/2, but it only goes up to -1/20, which is -0.05. So perhaps that's the intended answer.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the second inequality. Let me try solving it again.

-20u ≥ -1 → u ≤ 1/20.

Yes, that's correct.

So the interval is u ∈ [-1/2, 1/20].

But since this isn't an option, perhaps the correct answer is J, which is [-1/2, -1/20], but that's only the negative part. Maybe the problem expects only the negative u's to be considered, but that doesn't make sense because u can also be positive up to 0.05.

Wait, perhaps the problem is to find the interval where neither 2u nor -20u is less than -1, so both must be ≥ -1. So u must be ≥ -1/2 and ≤ 1/20.

But again, the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps the answer is option D: [-1/2, 0], but that would include u up to 0, but according to my calculation, u can go up to 0.05. So that's not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is J, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I made a mistake in the initial setup.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that when u is in the interval, both 2u and -20u are not less than -1. So, 2u ≥ -1 and -20u ≥ -1.

Which gives u ≥ -1/2 and u ≤ 1/20.

So the correct interval is [-1/2, 1/20], but since that's not an option, perhaps the answer is J, which is the closest.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake and the correct answer is J.

Wait, perhaps I should check with specific values.

Let's take u = -0.25, which is in option J. Then 2u = -0.5, which is ≥ -1, so that's good. -20u = 5, which is ≥ -1, so that's good.

Now take u = 0.03, which is within my calculated interval but not in any option. 2u = 0.06 ≥ -1, good. -20u = -0.6 ≥ -1, good.

Now take u = 0.06, which is just above 1/20. 2u = 0.12, which is fine. -20u = -1.2, which is less than -1, so that's bad. So u can't be 0.06.

Similarly, u = -0.6, which is less than -1/2. 2u = -1.2 < -1, which is bad, so u can't be -0.6.

So the interval is from -0.5 to 0.05.

But since that's not an option, perhaps the answer is J, which is the only option that starts at -0.5 and goes to -0.05, but that's only part of the correct interval.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup. Maybe the problem is to find the interval where both 2u and -20u are ≥ -1, which is what I did, but the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps the answer is option J because it's the only interval that starts at -1/2, but I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is option D: [-1/2, 0], but that would exclude u from 0 to 0.05, which is part of the correct interval.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck. Maybe I should try another approach. Let's find the values of u where 2u is not less than -1 and -20u is not less than -1.

So, 2u ≥ -1 → u ≥ -0.5.

-20u ≥ -1 → u ≤ 0.05.

So u must be between -0.5 and 0.05.

Looking at the options, the only option that includes any part of this interval is J: [-0.5, -0.05], which is the negative part.

But the correct interval includes both negative and positive up to 0.05. Since none of the options include that, perhaps the answer is J, but I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is option J because it's the only one that starts at -0.5 and ends before 0.05 in the negative direction.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the second inequality. Let me check again:

-20u ≥ -1 → u ≤ 1/20.

Yes, that's correct. So u can be up to 0.05.

So the interval is [-0.5, 0.05]. But since that's not an option, perhaps the answer is J, but I'm not confident.

Wait, perhaps the problem is to find the interval where both 2u and -20u are ≥ -1. So, the correct interval is [-0.5, 0.05]. But since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is J, [-0.5, -0.05], but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer to be J, even though it's only part of the correct interval. Maybe the options are incorrect.

In any case, given the options, the closest one is J: [-1/2, -1/20], so I'll go with that.
</think>

The problem requires finding the interval of all \( u \) such that neither \( 2u \) nor \( -20u \) is in the interval \( (-\infty, -1) \). This means both \( 2u \) and \( -20u \) must be greater than or equal to \(-1\).

1. From \( 2u \geq -1 \), we get \( u \geq -\frac{1}{2} \).
2. From \( -20u \geq -1 \), we get \( u \leq \frac{1}{20} \).

Combining these, \( u \) must lie in the interval \( \left[-\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{20}\right] \). However, none of the provided options match this interval exactly. The closest option is **J: \(\left[-\frac{1}{2}, -\frac{1}{20}\right]\)**, which covers the negative portion of the interval. 

Given the options, **J** is the most appropriate choice.

Answer: J
