Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about family therapy, specifically about Salvador Minuchin's structural approach. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

First, I need to remember what Minuchin's structural approach entails. From what I recall, Minuchin focused on understanding the family system as a whole, looking at the structure and dynamics within the family. He was interested in how roles, boundaries, and hierarchies functioned within the family.

The question is asking what a family therapist using his approach would most likely do. Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: Use a single-therapist model to maintain consistency. I think Minuchin might have used a single therapist, but I'm not sure if this is the key point. Other approaches might also use a single therapist, so I'm not certain.

Option B: Solely focus on individual therapy sessions with each family member. No, Minuchin's approach is more about the family as a system, so he probably wouldn't focus solely on individuals. He aimed to change the family structure, so group sessions would be more common.

Option C: Work initially with the most differentiated family member. Differentiated individuals are those who can function independently within the family system. Minuchin might identify such a person to help reorganize the family structure, so this sounds plausible.

Option D: Avoid discussing family dynamics and focus on external factors. That doesn't make sense because Minuchin's approach is all about the internal dynamics. So D is probably incorrect.

Option E: Encourage family members to solve their issues independently without intervention. No, Minuchin was about active intervention to change family structures, so E is unlikely.

Option F: Avoid issuing directives and let the family find their own solutions. I think structural therapy is more directive. Minuchin was known for being active, so F seems opposite to his approach.

Option G: Use a multiple-therapist team to prevent triangulation. Triangulation refers to a therapist getting caught in the family's conflicts. I'm not sure if Minuchin used multiple therapists. Some approaches use teams to avoid triangulation, but I'm not certain if this is his method.

Option H: Encourage groupthink to ensure family harmony. Groupthink isn't something Minuchin would promote; instead, he aimed to change dysfunctional structures, so H is probably wrong.

Option I: Clarify boundaries between family members to reduce enmeshment. Enmeshment is when boundaries are unclear, leading to over involvement. Minuchin's approach does focus on clarifying these boundaries to make the family structure healthier. So I think I is a strong candidate.

Now, thinking back, Minuchin's structural approach involves assessing the family structure, identifying roles, and working to change maladaptive patterns. He often worked with the most differentiated member to help reorganize the system. So both options C and I seem relevant.

Wait, but the question is about what the therapist would most likely do. Clarifying boundaries is a key part of his approach, aiming to reduce enmeshment and improve differentiation. So I think the answer is I. But earlier, I thought C was plausible too. Let me verify.

Minuchin's approach does involve identifying the most differentiated member because that person can be a key player in changing the family structure. However, the question is about the therapist's action. So the therapist would likely clarify boundaries, which is option I, to help the family function better by reducing enmeshment and enhancing clear roles.

Therefore, the answer should be I.

The structural approach of Salvador Minuchin focuses on understanding and changing the family system by clarifying boundaries and reducing enmeshment. This approach emphasizes identifying the most differentiated family member to facilitate reorganization of the family structure. However, the key action the therapist would take is to clarify boundaries, which helps reduce enmeshment and improve the family's functioning.

Answer: I
