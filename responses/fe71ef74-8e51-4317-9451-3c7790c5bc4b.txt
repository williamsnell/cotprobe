Question:

3 cards are chosen at random from a standard 52-card deck. What is the probability that they form a pair? (A 3-card hand is a 'pair' if two of the cards match in rank but the third card is different. For example, 668 is a pair, but 999 is not.)

Options:

A: \frac{1}{26}
B: \frac{13}{52}
C: \frac{1}{13}
D: \frac{72}{425}
E: \frac{1}{78}
F: \frac{4}{13}
G: \frac{1}{36}
H: \frac{3}{26}
I: \frac{1}{8}
J: \frac{1}{52}

Okay, so I have this probability problem here about drawing three cards from a standard deck and figuring out the chance that they form a pair. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I remember that a standard deck has 52 cards, divided into 4 suits, each with 13 ranks. So, ranks are like Ace, 2 through 10, Jack, Queen, King. Each rank has 4 cards, one for each suit.

The question is about forming a pair with three cards. That means two cards have the same rank, and the third is a different rank. For example, having two Kings and a 7 is a pair. But all three being the same rank, like three Kings, is not considered a pair here—it's called three of a kind, I think.

So, I need to calculate the probability of this happening when choosing three cards at random. Probability is generally the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.

Let me figure out the total number of possible 3-card hands first. Since the order doesn't matter in a hand, this is a combination problem. The formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number chosen.

So, the total number of possible 3-card hands is C(52, 3). Let me compute that. 52! / (3! * (52-3)!) = (52 * 51 * 50) / (3 * 2 * 1) = (52 * 51 * 50)/6. Let me calculate that: 52 divided by 2 is 26, so 26 * 51 * 50 / 3. Wait, maybe better to compute directly: 52 * 51 = 2652, 2652 * 50 = 132600. Then divide by 6: 132600 / 6 = 22100. So, the total possible hands are 22,100.

Now, the number of favorable outcomes—i.e., the number of 3-card hands that form a pair. How do I calculate that?

I think I should approach this by considering the number of ways to choose the pair and then the third card. So, first, choose the rank for the pair, then choose two suits from that rank, and then choose a different rank for the third card and pick one suit from that.

Let me break it down step by step.

1. Choose the rank for the pair: There are 13 possible ranks (Ace through King).

2. For that chosen rank, how many ways are there to pick two cards? Since each rank has 4 suits, the number of ways is C(4, 2) = 6.

3. Now, after choosing the pair, we need to choose the third card, which must be of a different rank. So, there are 12 remaining ranks to choose from (since it can't be the same as the pair's rank).

4. For the third card, we pick one of the 4 suits of that chosen rank. So, 4 choices.

So, putting it all together: The number of favorable hands is 13 (ranks) * C(4,2) (ways to choose the pair) * 12 (remaining ranks) * 4 (suits for the third card).

Wait, let me compute that. 13 * 6 * 12 * 4.

Let me compute step by step. 13 * 6 is 78. 78 * 12 is 936. 936 * 4 is 3744. So, there are 3,744 favorable hands.

Wait, wait. Wait a second. Is that correct? Because 3,744 divided by 22,100 would give a probability. Let me check that.

Alternatively, I think another way to calculate it is by considering that the first card can be any card. The second card has to match the first card's rank, and the third card has to be different. But maybe that approach is more complicated because of the different orders.

Wait, perhaps the way I did it first is correct. Let me think again.

So, number of possible pairs is 13 ranks, each with C(4,2)=6 ways, so 13*6=78 possible pairs. Then, for each such pair, the third card must be of a different rank, so 12 ranks, each with 4 suits, so 12*4=48 options. So, total favorable hands: 78 * 48 = 3,744.

Yes, that seems correct. So, the number of favorable outcomes is 3,744.

Therefore, the probability is 3,744 / 22,100. Let me simplify that fraction.

First, let's see if both numerator and denominator can be divided by 4. 3,744 ÷4=936. 22,100 ÷4=5,525. So, 936/5,525.

Hmm, can this be reduced further? Let's check if both are divisible by 3. 9+3+6=18, which is divisible by 3, so 936 ÷3=312. 5,525: 5+5+2+5=17, which isn't divisible by 3, so no.

Check if they are divisible by 4: 312 ÷4=78, 5,525 ÷4=1,381.25, which isn't an integer, so no.

Check if they are divisible by 13: 312 ÷13=24, since 13*24=312. 5,525 ÷13: 13*425=5,525 because 13*400=5,200 and 13*25=325, so 5,200+325=5,525. So, 312/5,525 = (24)/(425) after dividing numerator and denominator by 13.

Wait, wait. Let me verify that. 312 ÷13 is 24 because 13*24=312. 5,525 ÷13 is 425 because 13*400=5,200, 13*25=325, 5,200+325=5,525. So, yes, 5,525 ÷13 is 425.

So, the fraction becomes 24/425. Wait, but 24 and 425: do they have any common factors? 24 factors are 2,3, etc. 425 divided by 5 is 85, which is 5*17. So, 425=5^2 *17. 24 is 2^3 *3. No common factors, so 24/425 is the simplified form.

Now, looking at the options, I see option D is 72/425, and option H is 3/26, which is approximately 0.115. Let me check what 24/425 is. 24 ÷425: 425 goes into 24 zero times, 0.056... Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here because I remember that the probability of a pair in three-card poker is around 0.48, which is about 72/154 or similar.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check again.

Wait, earlier I thought the number of favorable hands was 3,744, and the total number of possible hands is 22,100. So, 3,744 /22,100.

Let me compute that as a decimal to see. 3,744 ÷22,100. Let me see: 22,100 ÷100=221, so 3,744 ÷221= let's see. 221*17=3,757, which is just a bit more than 3,744. So, approximately 16.9. So, 16.9/100, which is around 0.169. So, approximately 16.9%.

Looking at the options, option D is 72/425. Let me compute 72 ÷425. 425*0.17=72.25, so 72/425≈0.169, which matches our earlier decimal. So, 72/425 is the correct fraction.

Wait, but how did I get 24/425 earlier? Oh, I see where I went wrong. I must have miscalculated when simplifying. Let me check again.

Wait, earlier I had 3,744 /22,100 = (3,744 ÷4)/(22,100 ÷4) = 936/5,525. Then I thought of dividing numerator and denominator by 13, which gives 72/425 because 936 ÷13=72 and 5,525 ÷13=425. Oh, right! So, 936 ÷13 is 72 because 13*70=910, and 13*2=26, so 910+26=936. So, 72/425. So, my initial mistake was when I thought I had 24/425, but actually, it's 72/425. So, the correct answer is D:72/425.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the initial calculation of favorable outcomes. So, 13 ranks for the pair, each with C(4,2)=6, so 13*6=78. Then, 12 ranks left, each with 4 choices, so 12*4=48. So, 78*48=3,744. Correct. So, 3,744 /22,100 = 72/425. So, option D is correct.

To determine the probability of drawing a pair when selecting three cards from a standard 52-card deck, we calculate the number of favorable outcomes and divide by the total number of possible 3-card hands.

1. **Total number of possible 3-card hands**:  
   Using combinations, \( C(52, 3) = \frac{52 \times 51 \times 50}{3 \times 2 \times 1} = 22,100 \).

2. **Number of favorable outcomes (pairs)**:  
   - Choose a rank for the pair: 13 options.  
   - Choose 2 suits from the selected rank: \( C(4, 2) = 6 \) ways.  
   - Choose a different rank for the third card: 12 options.  
   - Choose 1 suit from the new rank: 4 options.  
   Total favorable hands: \( 13 \times 6 \times 12 \times 4 = 3,744 \).

3. **Probability**:  
   \( \frac{3,744}{22,100} = \frac{72}{425} \).
