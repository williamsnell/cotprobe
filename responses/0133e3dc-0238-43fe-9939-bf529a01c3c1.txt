Okay, so I have this question about Thomas Aquinas and his examples of self-evident propositions. I'm a bit rusty on my philosophy, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that Aquinas discusses self-evident propositions in his works, particularly in the context of different types of knowledge. A self-evident proposition is one whose truth is immediately clear to the mind once the terms are understood. These are often called "analytic" truths, I think.

Looking at the options, I need to figure out which one isn't something Aquinas would consider self-evident. Let's go through each option one by one.

Option A: "Man is a rational being." I think Aquinas would consider this self-evident because it's part of the definition of man. He probably took it as given that humans have reason.

Option B: "All bachelors are unmarried." This is a classic example of a self-evident proposition because it's just a definition. If you understand what a bachelor is, it's clear that they are unmarried.

Option C: "Night follows day." Wait, is this self-evident? I'm not so sure. It seems more like an empirical statement based on observation. Aquinas might have considered it as a matter of experience rather than something that's immediately clear by definition. But I'm not certain yet.

Option D: "The sum of the angles of a triangle is 180 degrees." This is a geometric fact. I don't think Aquinas would consider this self-evident because it's something you prove through geometry, not something obvious from the definition of a triangle.

Option E: "The same thing cannot be affirmed and denied at the same time." This is the law of non-contradiction, which Aquinas would definitely consider self-evident. It's a fundamental principle of logic.

Option F: "The light of Thy countenance, O Lord, is signed upon us." This sounds like a religious statement, maybe from the Bible. Aquinas would use religious truths, but I don't think he'd consider this a self-evident proposition. It's more of a revealed truth than something that's obvious by definition.

Option G: "A square has four sides." Again, this seems like a definition. If you know what a square is, it's clear that it has four sides. So Aquinas would see this as self-evident.

Option H: "Every whole is greater than its part." This is a self-evident truth in philosophy. It's a basic principle that doesn't require proof once you understand the terms.

Option I: "Things equal to one and the same are equal to one another." This is the transitive property of equality, which is a self-evident principle in logic and mathematics.

Option J: "An effect depends on its cause." This is a principle in philosophy, often discussed in relation to causation. Aquinas would consider this self-evident because it's part of understanding cause and effect.

Now, putting it all together. The question is asking which is NOT an example Aquinas gives. So the options that are self-evident would be A, B, E, G, H, I, J. That leaves C, D, and F as possible candidates.

Looking back, option D is about the sum of angles, which requires proof, so it's not self-evident. Option C, "Night follows day," might be empirical rather than self-evident. Option F is a religious statement, which is a different category. So among these, which one does Aquinas not consider self-evident.

I think Aquinas would group options like A, B, E, G, H, I, J as self-evident. So the ones that are not would be C, D, and F. The question is asking for which is NOT given by Aquinas as an example.

Looking at the options, the question is about what Aquinas does NOT give as an example. So, the answer could be either C, D, or F.

Wait, I recall that Aquinas's self-evident propositions include things like definitions and axioms. So "All bachelors are unmarried" (B) is a definition. "Man is rational" (A) is also a definition. "A square has four sides" (G) is a definition. "The same thing cannot be both affirmed and denied" (E) is a logical axiom. "Every whole is greater than its part" (H) is a philosophical axiom. "Things equal to one another are equal to each other" (I) is a mathematical axiom. "An effect depends on its cause" (J) is a philosophical principle.

So, among the options, D and F are the ones that might not be self-evident. But the question is about which is not given by Aquinas as an example.

Wait, the question is asking which is NOT an example Aquinas gives. So the correct answer is the one that Aquinas doesn't consider self-evident.

Option D is a geometric truth that requires proof, so Aquinas wouldn't consider it self-evident. Option F is a religious statement, which Aquinas would treat as revealed truth, not self-evident. Option C is about the sequence of night and day, which is empirical.

So, looking at the options, which one is not self-evident. The question is which one is NOT given by Aquinas. So, the answer is either C, D, or F.

Wait, I think Aquinas would include things like definitions and basic principles. So "All bachelors are unmarried" is a definition, so it's self-evident. "The sum of angles" is a theorem, so not self-evident.

So, the options that are not self-evident are C, D, and F. But the question is which is not given by Aquinas as an example. So the correct answer would be one of these.

Looking back, the options are A to J. The question is which is NOT an example. So the answer is either C, D, or F.

Wait, another angle: Aquinas's self-evident propositions include logical, mathematical, and some metaphysical principles. So, "The light of Thy countenance" (F) is a scriptural statement, not a self-evident proposition. So F is not an example.

But I'm a bit confused because I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, the question might be looking for the empirical statement, which is C: "Night follows day."

Wait, another thought: "Night follows day" is something we observe, but is it self-evident? If I understand the terms, does it immediately follow? Or is it something that needs to be learned through experience?

I think Aquinas would consider it empirical, so not self-evident. Similarly, D is a geometric fact, which also isn't self-evident.

But the options are asking which is not given by Aquinas. So the correct answer is either C, D, or F.

I think the answer is F because it's a religious statement, and Aquinas might not consider it self-evident in the same way as the others. But I'm not entirely certain.

Wait, let me think again. Aquinas's self-evident propositions are those that are known by definition or by necessity. So, F is a statement from scripture, which is a different category. So, it's not a self-evident proposition as per Aquinas's definitions.

So the answer would be F.

The question asks which option is not an example Aquinas gives of a self-evident proposition. Self-evident propositions are truths whose validity is immediately clear upon understanding their terms. Aquinas would consider definitions, logical axioms, and some metaphysical principles as self-evident. 

- **Option A**: "Man is a rational being." This is a definition and self-evident.
- **Option B**: "All bachelors are unmarried." This is a definition and self-evident.
- **Option C**: "Night follows day." This is empirical and based on observation, not self-evident.
- **Option D**: "The sum of the angles of a triangle is 180 degrees." This is a geometric fact requiring proof, not self-evident.
- **Option E**: "The same thing cannot be affirmed and denied at the same time." This is the law of non-contradiction, a self-evident logical principle.
- **Option F**: "The light of Thy countenance, O Lord, is signed upon us." This is a religious statement, not a self-evident proposition.
- **Option G**: "A square has four sides." This is a definition and self-evident.
- **Option H**: "Every whole is greater than its part." This is a self-evident philosophical principle.
- **Option I**: "Things equal to one and the same are equal to one another." This is the transitive property of equality, self-evident.
- **Option J**: "An effect depends on its cause." This is a self-evident philosophical principle.

Among these, **C**, **D**, and **F** are not self-evident. However, the question asks for the one that Aquinas does not consider as an example. Since Aquinas focuses on definitions, logical axioms, and metaphysical principles, **F** is the best choice as it is a religious statement, not a self-evident proposition.

**Answer: F**
