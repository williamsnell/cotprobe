Question:

Which of the following best accounts for the negative slope of the liquid-solid equilibrium line in the phase diagram for water?

Options:

A: H2O(s) has a greater density than H2O(l), which is the result of the van der Waals forces between water molecules.
B: H2O(s) has a lower density than H2O(l) which results from the crystalline framework that forms due to hydrogen bonds.
C: H2O(s) has a lower density than H2O(l) which causes the solid to form liquid under low pressure conditions.
D: H2O(s) has a lower density than H2O(l), this is caused by the metallic bonds formed between water molecules.
E: H2O(s) has a lower density than H2O(l), which causes the solid to form liquid under high pressure conditions.
F: H2O(s) has a lower density than H2O(l), which is a result of the covalent bonds formed between water molecules.
G: H2O(s) has a greater density than H2O(l), which results from the hydrogen bonds formed between water molecules.
H: H2O(s) has a greater density than H2O(l), which results in the solid forming liquid under low pressure conditions.
I: H2O(s) has a greater density than H2O(l), which is due to the ionic bonds formed between water molecules.
J: H2O(s) has a greater density than H2O(l), which causes the solid to form liquid under high pressure conditions.

Okay, so I've got this question about the phase diagram for water and why the liquid-solid equilibrium line has a negative slope. Hmm, I remember that phase diagrams usually show the different phases of a substance under varying conditions of pressure and temperature. The lines on these diagrams represent the boundaries where two phases coexist in equilibrium.

Water is a special substance because its solid (ice) is less dense than its liquid form. That's why ice floats, right? So, when pressure increases, what happens? For most substances, increasing pressure favors the denser phase, which is usually the solid. But for water, since ice is less dense, increasing pressure would actually push the equilibrium towards the denser phase, which is liquid water. So, at higher pressures, you might have liquid instead of solid.

Wait, the question is about the negative slope of the liquid-solid line. A negative slope means that as pressure increases, the melting point (temperature at which solid and liquid coexist) decreases. So, higher pressure leads to a lower melting point. That makes sense because applying pressure would force the solid into a smaller volume, but since ice is less dense, it's more stable at lower pressures. So when pressure goes up, it's harder for the solid to stay solid because the substance wants to go to a higher density, which is the liquid.

Looking at the options, the key is why the slope is negative. It's because the solid is less dense than the liquid. So, the reason must involve the structure of ice. I remember that ice forms a crystalline structure due to hydrogen bonding. The hydrogen bonds arrange the water molecules in a way that creates a framework, making the solid less dense than the liquid. Because of this structure, when pressure is applied, it's easier for the solid to melt because the molecules can pack more closely in the liquid form, which is denser.

So looking at the options, option B says that H2O(s) has a lower density than H2O(l), which results from the crystalline framework due to hydrogen bonds. That seems correct. Let me check the others. Option A says solid is more dense, which isn't true. Option C talks about lower density causing solid to form liquid under low pressure, but I think the pressure effect is more about the slope. Option D mentions metallic bonds, which aren't present in water. Option E says lower density causes solid to form liquid under high pressure, but that's not exactly right because lower density of solid means under high pressure, solid would melt. Wait, does that align with the slope? Higher pressure lowers the melting point, so at a given higher pressure, the melting point is lower. So the line slopes downward as pressure increases.

Option F talks about covalent bonds, which are in the liquid but not in the solid. Hydrogen bonds are weaker, so in the solid, they form a rigid structure. Option G says solid is more dense, which is wrong. H and I talk about ionic bonds, which don't apply here. J says solid is more dense, which is wrong.

So the correct explanation is that ice is less dense, due to hydrogen bonds forming a crystalline structure. So the answer is B.

The negative slope of the liquid-solid equilibrium line in water's phase diagram occurs because ice (H₂O(s)) is less dense than liquid water (H₂O(l)). This is due to the crystalline framework formed by hydrogen bonds in ice, which creates a less compact structure compared to liquid water. As pressure increases, the equilibrium shifts toward the denser liquid phase, causing the melting point to decrease, resulting in the negative slope.

Answer: B
