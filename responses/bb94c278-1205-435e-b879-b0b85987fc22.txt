Okay, so I have this question about what doesn't contribute to individual differences in developing vocal language skills. Let's see, the options are A to F. I need to figure out which one is NOT a contributor.

First, I'll go through each option one by one. 

Option A: The quality of nonparental early care and education experiences. Hmm, I remember that early care, like daycare or preschool, can influence language development because children interact with teachers and peers, which can affect how they learn to speak. So A probably is a contributor.

Option B: Hearing loss. That makes sense because if a child can't hear well, it's harder for them to pick up sounds and speech. So hearing loss definitely affects language development. B is a contributor.

Option C: Variation in the support for language acquisition in the social environment. Yeah, if a child gets more encouragement, more reading, more talking from parents or others, that would support better language skills. So C contributes.

Option D: The particular native language in a child’s environment. Wait, that seems a bit tricky. Different native languages have different structures, but does that directly cause individual differences in skill development? Or is it more about the language's complexity affecting how easy it is to learn? Maybe the specific language affects how quickly a child learns it, but does it contribute to individual differences? Or perhaps it's more about the environment than the language itself. I'm not so sure here. Let me think more.

Option E: The child's grade level in school. Grade level might correlate with age and thus language skills, but does the grade itself cause differences? Like, a higher grade might mean more exposure, but maybe it's the age that's the real factor. So E might not be a direct contributor but more of an indirect one based on age.

Option F: The child's age. Definitely, age affects language development stages. A younger child is still learning basics, while an older one is more advanced. So F is a contributor.

So, looking back, the question is which is NOT a contributor. Let me think again about D. The native language's structure could influence the difficulty of acquiring it, but that's more about the language itself rather than individual differences. Wait, but if two children are exposed to different languages, that could affect their skill development. However, the question is about individual differences, meaning differences between the same child over time or among different children. The native language is a factor, but maybe it's more about other factors like environment and hearing. Alternatively, perhaps the native language is a constant for a child, so it's more about other variables. Or maybe the native language's characteristics don't directly cause individual differences but influence the overall trajectory. Alternatively, maybe the presence of a particular language isn't a contributing factor to individual variation as much as other factors like support systems or hearing.

Wait, another angle: The question is about what doesn't contribute. So, which of these factors doesn't affect individual differences. The child's grade level (E) might be an effect rather than a cause. Like, being in a higher grade is a result of their age and prior learning, not a cause of better language skills. So E might be the answer.

Alternatively, perhaps D, the native language, doesn't contribute because it's more about the language's structure affecting all speakers similarly, not individual differences. Or maybe it does. I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, the question is about what is NOT a contributor. So, the correct answer should be the one that doesn't influence individual differences in vocal language development.

Let me list the options again:

A: Nonparental care quality – yes, it affects language.

B: Hearing loss – yes.

C: Support in environment – yes.

D: Native language – maybe yes, because different languages may have different characteristics that affect learning.

E: Grade level – perhaps not, as it's more about age and education, which are separate factors.

F: Age – yes, definitely affects.

So, the answer is either E or D. Wait, the question is about individual differences. So, the native language would be a factor for each individual, but not contributing to differences among individuals. Because if two children are exposed to different native languages, that's part of their environment, not an individual difference. Or maybe it is part of their environment, so it affects their skills, but it's not an individual difference per se. Hmm.

Wait, the question is which is NOT a contributor. So, the options are all factors except one. So, the correct answer is E: the child's grade level in school. Because grade level is more of an outcome based on age and school progression, not a direct cause of language skill differences. Or perhaps the grade level doesn't directly influence language skills beyond what's explained by age and other factors.

The question asks which option is NOT a contributor to individual differences in the development of vocal language skills. To determine this, each option is analyzed:

- **A**: The quality of nonparental early care and education experiences can influence language development through interactions with teachers and peers, making it a contributor.
- **B**: Hearing loss directly impacts the ability to acquire language, so it is a contributor.
- **C**: Variation in support for language acquisition in the social environment affects how much a child is exposed to and encouraged in language use, making it a contributor.
- **D**: The particular native language in a child’s environment can influence language development, as different languages have varying structures. However, this is more about the environment than individual differences.
- **E**: The child's grade level in school is likely an indirect factor, as it correlates with age and prior learning rather than being a direct contributor to language skill differences.
- **F**: The child's age is a direct contributor, as it affects developmental stages and language acquisition.

After careful consideration, **E: The child's grade level in school** is identified as the option that is NOT a direct contributor to individual differences in vocal language skills, as it is more reflective of age and educational progression rather than a unique factor influencing language development.
