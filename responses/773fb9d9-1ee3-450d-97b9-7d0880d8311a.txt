Okay, so I have this problem about standing waves produced by two superimposing waves. The question gives me two wave equations, y1 and y2, and I need to find the amplitude at a specific point x=21. The options are from A to J, and I have to choose the correct one.

First, I remember that standing waves are formed when two waves of the same amplitude and frequency travel in opposite directions. Their superposition leads to a standing wave pattern. The general form of such waves is y1 = A sin(kx - ωt) and y2 = A sin(kx + ωt), or something similar.

Looking at the given equations:

y1 = 15 sin(3πt - 5x)
y2 = 15 sin(3πt + 5x)

Wait, actually, the wave equations are given as y1=15 sin(3πt -5x) and y2=15 sin(3πt +5x). So yes, these are two waves with the same amplitude (15), same frequency (since the coefficients of t are the same), and moving in opposite directions because one has +5x and the other has -5x.

The next step is to find the superposition of these two waves. The formula for the superposition is y = y1 + y2. So,

y = 15 sin(3πt -5x) + 15 sin(3πt +5x)

I think there's a trigonometric identity that can simplify this sum. The identity is sin A + sin B = 2 sin[(A+B)/2] cos[(A-B)/2]. Let me apply that here.

Let me set A = 3πt -5x and B = 3πt +5x.

Then, (A + B)/2 = [ (3πt -5x) + (3πt +5x) ] / 2 = (6πt)/2 = 3πt.

And (A - B)/2 = [ (3πt -5x) - (3πt +5x) ] / 2 = (-10x)/2 = -5x.

So substituting back into the identity:

y = 15 [ sin(3πt) cos(5x) + cos(3πt) sin(5x) ] Wait, no. Wait, the identity is sin A + sin B = 2 sin( (A+B)/2 ) cos( (A-B)/2 ). So,

y = 15 [ sin(3πt) cos(5x) + sin(3πt) cos(5x) ]? Wait, no, wait. Let me do it correctly.

Wait, the sum is 15 [sin(3πt -5x) + sin(3πt +5x)] = 15 * 2 sin( (3πt -5x +3πt +5x)/2 ) cos( (3πt -5x - (3πt +5x))/2 )

Simplify numerator inside sine:

(6πt)/2 = 3πt.

Inside cosine:

( -10x ) / 2 = -5x. But cosine is even, so cos(-5x) = cos(5x).

So,

y = 15 * 2 sin(3πt) cos(5x) = 30 sin(3πt) cos(5x).

Wait, that seems correct. So the equation simplifies to y = 30 sin(3πt) cos(5x).

But wait, I'm trying to find the amplitude of the motion at x=21. Wait, but in a standing wave, the amplitude varies with position. The general form is y = 2A sin(kx) cos(ωt), but in this case, it's y = 30 sin(3πt) cos(5x), but wait, no, 30 is 2 times 15, so perhaps the amplitude is 30 cos(5x), but wait, that's not right because the amplitude of a standing wave is 2A times the cosine term. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, let me think again. The standard standing wave equation is y = 2A sin(kx) cos(ωt), where A is the amplitude of each individual wave. So in this case, A is 15. So 2A would be 30, which is the amplitude of the standing wave, but it's modulated by cos(kx). Wait, no, because when you apply the identity, the standing wave is y = 2A sin(kx) cos(ωt). Wait, but in our case, the equation is y = 30 sin(3πt) cos(5x). So I think the amplitude at any position x is 30 cos(5x). Because the amplitude is the coefficient in front of the sin(ωt) term. So the maximum displacement amplitude at a point x is 30 cos(5x).

So at x=21, the amplitude is 30 cos(5 * 21). Let's compute 5*21=105 radians.

Wait, 105 radians is a lot. Let me see how to compute cos(105 radians). Hmm, since 2π is approximately 6.283 radians, 105 / (2π) is about 105 / 6.283 ≈ 16.7 full circles. So the angle is equivalent to 105 - 16*2π (since 16*6.283≈100.53). So 105 - 100.53 ≈4.47 radians.

Alternatively, I can compute cos(105) directly, but perhaps using a calculator. Wait, but I don't have a calculator here. Alternatively, I can note that 105 radians is equal to 105 modulo 2π. Let me compute 105 / (2π) ≈16.7, so 16 * 2π = 32π ≈100.53, so 105 -100.53 ≈4.47 radians.

So cos(4.47 radians) is approximately equal to cos(4.47). Let's think about the unit circle. 4.47 radians is more than π (≈3.14) and less than 3π/2 (≈4.712). So it's in the third quadrant, where cosine is negative.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute cos(105) using a calculator. Alternatively, perhaps there's a way to find it exactly. But maybe the problem expects me to recognize that 5x at x=21 is 105, and that cos(105 radians) is zero. Wait, why would that be? Because 105 is 17*2π - 1. So 17*2π is 34π, which is about 106.8, so 105 is a little less than that. Wait, maybe not exactly zero.

Wait, wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake. Let me compute 5x at x=21: 5*21=105 radians. Now, 105 radians is equal to how many full circles? Since each full circle is 2π≈6.283 radians. Let me compute 105 / 6.283 ≈ 16.699. So 16 full circles (≈100.53 radians) plus 4.47 radians. So 105 radians is the same as 4.47 radians in terms of the unit circle.

Now, what's the cosine of 4.47 radians? Let me think: 4.47 is between π≈3.14 and 3π/2≈4.712. So it's in the third quadrant, where cosine is negative. The reference angle would be 4.47 - π ≈1.33 radians. Cos(1.33) is approximately 0.24 (since cos(π/3)=0.5, cos(1 rad)=0.54, cos(1.2)=0.36, cos(1.3)=0.26, etc.). So cos(1.33) ≈0.24, so cos(4.47) ≈-0.24.

Wait, but perhaps I should calculate it more accurately. Alternatively, perhaps there's a trick here. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe the amplitude is 30 cos(5x) at a given x. So at x=21, 5x=105. Let's compute cos(105 radians):

But wait, 105 = 16*6.283 + 4.47, as before. So cos(4.47) ≈-0.24. So the amplitude would be 30 * (-0.24) ≈-7.2, but amplitude is the absolute value, so 7.2. But looking at the options, I don't see 7.2, but option I is 7.5, which is close. Hmm, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate 5x = 105, and then compute cos(105). Let me compute 105 mod 2π:

Compute 105 / (2π) ≈105 /6.283≈16.72. So 16*2π≈100.53, so 105-100.53≈4.47 radians.

Now, 4.47 radians is approximately 256 degrees (since π≈3.1416=180 degrees, so 4.47*(180/3.1416)≈4.47*57.3≈256 degrees). 256 degrees is in the third quadrant, so cosine is negative. The reference angle is 256-180=76 degrees. Cos(76 degrees) is about 0.2419. So cos(256)= -0.2419. So 30 * (-0.2419)≈-7.257. The amplitude is the absolute value, so 7.257, which is approximately 7.26. But looking at the options, the closest is I:7.5, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the question is about the maximum amplitude at x=21, but I think I did it correctly. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial superposition.

Wait, let me go back. The sum of the two waves is y = 15 sin(3πt -5x) +15 sin(3πt +5x). Using the identity, it's 30 sin(3πt) cos(5x). So the amplitude of the standing wave at any point x is 30 cos(5x). So at x=21, it's 30 cos(5*21)=30 cos(105). So yeah, that's correct.

Wait, but perhaps 105 radians is an exact multiple. Let me see: 105 divided by π is about 33.3. So 105 = 33π. Wait, 33π is 16.5*2π. So that's 16 full circles plus π radians. So 105 radians is equal to π radians (since 16.5*2π = 33π ≈103.67, which is a bit less than 105, so perhaps 105=33π + (105 -33π)=105 -103.67≈1.33 radians. Wait, that can't be right because 33π is 103.67, so 105-103.67=1.33 radians. So cos(105)=cos(33π +1.33)=cos(π +1.33)=cos(4.47 radians), because cos(π +θ) = -cos θ. Wait, no, wait, cos(π +θ) = -cos θ. So cos(33π +1.33) = cos(π +1.33 +32π) = cos(π +1.33) = -cos(1.33). So cos(1.33)= approx 0.2419, so cos(4.47)= -0.2419.

So 30 * (-0.2419)≈-7.257. The amplitude is 7.257, which is approximately 7.26. But the options don't have this. Let me look again: options are A:24, B:30, C:21, D:12, E:27, F:9.27, G:0, H:15, I:7.5, J:18.54.

Hmm, 7.26 is close to 7.5 (option I), but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I can compute cos(105) more accurately. Alternatively, perhaps I should note that 5x=105, so x=21. Now, 105 = 17*6.283 (since 17*6.283=106.811), but that's over 105. So 105 is 17*2π - (17*2π -105). Let me compute 17*2π=106.814, so 106.814 -105=1.814 radians. So cos(105)=cos(106.814 -1.814)=cos(106.814 -1.814). But cos is periodic with 2π, so cos(105)=cos(105-16*2π)=cos(105-100.53)=cos(4.47).

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute cos(4.47) using a calculator. Let me think: 4.47 radians is about 256 degrees, as before. Cos(256)=cos(180+76)= -cos(76)≈-0.2419. So 30*(-0.2419)= -7.257, amplitude is 7.257, which is approximately 7.26. So the closest option is I:7.5. But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait another thing: perhaps the amplitude at x=21 is zero. Let me think, maybe cos(5x) is zero at x=21. Because 5x=105, which is 105/(π/2)=210, which is an odd multiple of π/2. Wait, cos(nπ/2) is zero when n is odd. Let me check: 5x=105= nπ/2. Solving for n: n= (105 *2)/π≈ (210)/3.1416≈66.87. So n≈66.87, which is not an integer. So cos(105) is not zero. So option G:0 is incorrect.

Wait, but perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again about the standing wave equation. The standing wave is y=30 sin(3πt) cos(5x). So the amplitude at any x is 30 cos(5x). So at x=21, 5x=105. So the amplitude is 30 cos(105). Now, if 105 is a multiple of π, then cos(105) could be ±1, but that's not the case here.

Wait, perhaps cos(105) is zero. Let me check: 105 radians. Let me compute how many times 2π goes into 105. 105/(2π)= approximately 16.72. So 16*2π=100.53, as before. So 105-100.53=4.47 radians. 4.47 is not a multiple of π/2, so cos(4.47) is not zero.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the way I applied the identity. Let me double-check the superposition.

y1=15 sin(3πt -5x)
y2=15 sin(3πt +5x)

Sum: y = 15 [sin(3πt -5x) + sin(3πt +5x)]

Using the identity: sin A + sin B = 2 sin[(A+B)/2] cos[(A-B)/2]

So,

y = 15 * 2 sin( (3πt -5x +3πt +5x)/2 ) cos( (3πt -5x - (3πt +5x))/2 )

Simplify numerator inside sine: (6πt)/2=3πt

Denominator inside cosine: (-10x)/2= -5x

So,

y =30 sin(3πt) cos(5x)

That seems correct. So the amplitude is 30 cos(5x), which at x=21 is 30 cos(105).

Wait, perhaps I should compute cos(105) using a calculator. Let me try to compute it.

Wait, 105 radians is a large angle, but since cosine is periodic every 2π, I can subtract multiples of 2π until I get within 0 to 2π.

Compute 105 / (2π) ≈105 /6.283≈16.72. So 16 full circles (16*2π=100.53). So 105 -100.53=4.47 radians.

So cos(4.47) is approximately what? I can compute it using the Taylor series expansion around π, perhaps, but that might be time-consuming.

Alternatively, I can note that 4.47 radians is approximately 256 degrees. Let me compute cos(256 degrees):

256 degrees is in the third quadrant, so cos is negative.

256 - 180 =76 degrees. Cos(76 degrees) ≈0.2419. So cos(256)= -0.2419.

Thus, cos(4.47)= -0.2419.

So 30 * (-0.2419)= -7.257, so the amplitude is 7.257, which is approximately 7.26. Looking at the options, the closest is I:7.5. But wait, option F is 9.27, which is higher. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check.

Wait, 5x=105, so x=21. So cos(5*21)=cos(105). Wait, perhaps I can compute this differently. 105 radians is equal to 105 - 16*2π=105-100.53096≈4.46904 radians.

Now, compute cos(4.46904). Let's compute this using a calculator.

Wait, cos(4.46904) ≈-0.2419. So 30*(-0.2419)= -7.257. So the amplitude is 7.257, which is approximately 7.26. The options don't have this, but option I is 7.5, which is close. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the amplitude differently. Another way to find the amplitude at a point x is to find the maximum displacement at that point. The amplitude is the maximum value of y, which occurs when sin(3πt)=±1, so y= ±30 cos(5x). So the amplitude is 30 |cos(5x)|. So at x=21, it's 30 |cos(105)|.

Wait, but cos(105) is negative, so |cos(105)| is 0.2419, so amplitude is 30 *0.2419≈7.257.

Hmm, but the options don't have this. So perhaps the correct answer is F:9.27, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the process.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is using a different form, like y = 2A sin(kx) cos(ωt), where the amplitude is 2A sin(kx). Wait, no, that's not correct. The standard form is y = 2A sin(kx) cos(ωt), so the amplitude at position x is 2A |sin(kx)|. Wait, but in our case, the equation is y=30 sin(3πt) cos(5x). So the amplitude is 30 cos(5x), not 30 sin(5x). So perhaps I was correct earlier.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I'm using the wrong identity. Let me think again. Another possible identity is sin(a) + sin(b) = 2 sin( (a+b)/2 ) cos( (a-b)/2 ). So applying this correctly:

y1 + y2 =15 sin(3πt -5x) +15 sin(3πt +5x) =15 [ sin(3πt -5x) + sin(3πt +5x) ]

Using the identity:

=15 * 2 sin( [ (3πt -5x) + (3πt +5x) ] / 2 ) * cos( [ (3πt -5x) - (3πt +5x) ] / 2 )

=30 sin( (6πt)/2 ) * cos( (-10x)/2 )

=30 sin(3πt) * cos(-5x)

But cos(-θ)=cosθ, so this becomes 30 sin(3πt) cos(5x). So yes, that's correct.

So the amplitude at any x is 30 cos(5x). At x=21, 5x=105, so amplitude is 30 cos(105). As before, which is approximately 30*(-0.2419)= -7.257, so amplitude is 7.257. The closest option is I:7.5.

Wait, but maybe I should compute this more accurately. Let me try to compute cos(105) more precisely.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use a calculator for cos(105 radians).

Using a calculator:

cos(105) ≈cos(105 -16*2π)=cos(105 -100.53096)=cos(4.46904).

Now, cos(4.46904) ≈-0.2419.

So 30 * (-0.2419) ≈-7.257, so the amplitude is 7.257, which is approximately 7.26. Since the options don't have this, but option I is 7.5, perhaps that's the intended answer. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the amplitude is zero because cos(5x) is zero at x=21. Let me check if 5x=105 is a multiple of π/2.

105 = n*(π/2) →n= 210/π≈66.87. Not an integer, so cos(105)≠0. So option G:0 is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial step. Let me recheck the problem statement.

The problem states y1=15 sin(3πt -5x) and y2=15 sin(3πt +5x). So the sum is correct as I did earlier.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is in degrees instead of radians. Wait, no, the equations are given with π, so it's in radians.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is option F:9.27. Let me think: 9.27 is about 30*0.309. So if cos(105)=0.309, then 30*0.309=9.27. But earlier calculations suggest cos(105)=approx -0.2419, which would give 7.257.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier. Let me compute 4.47 radians more accurately.

4.47 radians is 4 radians plus 0.47 radians.

Compute cos(4.47):

We can use the Taylor series expansion around π=3.1416.

4.47 - π ≈1.3284 radians.

So cos(4.47)=cos(π +1.3284)= -cos(1.3284).

Now, cos(1.3284) can be computed as:

cos(1.3284)=1 - (1.3284)^2/2! + (1.3284)^4/4! - ... 

But perhaps it's easier to use a calculator approximation.

Alternatively, using a calculator:

cos(1.3284) ≈0.2419.

So cos(4.47)= -0.2419, as before.

So 30 * (-0.2419)= -7.257, amplitude is 7.257.

But none of the options match exactly. The closest is I:7.5. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to recognize that the amplitude is zero because the waves are traveling in the same direction, but no, the problem states they're traveling in opposite directions.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the amplitude is the sum of the two individual amplitudes when they are in phase. But no, that's not the case here because they're traveling in opposite directions, leading to a standing wave.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the amplitude using another method. Let me think: the maximum displacement at a point x is given by the coefficient of cos(ωt), which is 30 cos(5x). So at x=21, it's 30 cos(105). As before.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 5x=105 mod 2π.

Compute 105/(2π)=16.72. So 16 full circles, 16*2π=100.53. 105-100.53=4.47 radians.

So cos(4.47)=cos(π +1.3284)= -cos(1.3284). Now, 1.3284 radians is approximately 76 degrees. Cos(76 degrees)=approx 0.2419. So, cos(4.47)= -0.2419.

Thus, amplitude is 30 * 0.2419=7.257. So approximately 7.26, which is closest to option I:7.5.

Wait, but perhaps the problem expects a different approach. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the amplitude is zero because the waves are traveling in the same direction, but that's not the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the amplitude as the sum of the two amplitudes, but that's only when they are in phase, which isn't the case here.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the identity. Let me double-check.

sin A + sin B = 2 sin[(A+B)/2] cos[(A-B)/2]. So,

y1 + y2 =15 [ sin(3πt -5x) + sin(3πt +5x) ] =15 * 2 sin(3πt) cos(5x)=30 sin(3πt) cos(5x).

Yes, that's correct.

So the amplitude at any x is 30 cos(5x). At x=21, it's 30 cos(105)≈30*(-0.2419)= -7.257. The amplitude is the absolute value, so 7.257.

Since the options don't have this, perhaps the intended answer is option I:7.5, which is close. Alternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem setup.

Wait, perhaps I should compute cos(105) more accurately. Let me try to compute it using a calculator.

Using a calculator, cos(105 radians) is approximately cos(105)≈-0.2419. So 30 * (-0.2419)= -7.257. So the amplitude is 7.257.

But looking at the options again: the options are A:24, B:30, C:21, D:12, E:27, F:9.27, G:0, H:15, I:7.5, J:18.54.

Hmm, 7.257 is closest to option I:7.5. So perhaps the intended answer is I:7.5.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach and the correct answer is option F:9.27. Let me think: 9.27 is approximately 30 * 0.309. So if cos(105)=0.309, then 30*0.309=9.27. But earlier calculations show cos(105)=approx -0.2419. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps I should compute cos(105) using a calculator precisely.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute 5x=105, and then find cos(105). Let me think: 105 radians is 16*6.283 + 4.47, as before. So cos(4.47)=cos(256 degrees)=approx -0.2419.

So the amplitude is 30 * 0.2419=7.257, which is approximately 7.26. The closest option is I:7.5.

But wait, perhaps the problem is using a different approach. Let me think: perhaps the maximum amplitude is when the two waves are in phase, which would be when their phase difference is zero. But in this case, the waves are traveling in opposite directions, so their superposition creates a standing wave with amplitude varying with position.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the amplitude is zero because x=21 is a node. But nodes occur where cos(5x)=0, which would be at x where 5x = nπ/2, n integer. 5x=105 → x=21. So 105 =nπ/2 →n=210/π≈66.87. Not an integer, so x=21 is not a node. So amplitude is not zero.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck here. Based on my calculations, the amplitude should be approximately 7.26, but the closest option is I:7.5. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option F:9.27, but I don't see how that would fit.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the identity. Let me check again.

Wait, the identity is sin A + sin B = 2 sin( (A+B)/2 ) cos( (A-B)/2 ). So in this case, A=3πt -5x, B=3πt +5x.

(A+B)/2= (6πt)/2=3πt.

(A-B)/2= (-10x)/2=-5x.

So the identity gives 2 sin(3πt) cos(-5x)=2 sin(3πt) cos(5x), since cos is even.

So y=15*2 sin(3πt) cos(5x)=30 sin(3πt) cos(5x). So that's correct.

Thus, the amplitude is 30 cos(5x). At x=21, 5x=105, so amplitude is 30 cos(105)≈30*(-0.2419)= -7.257. The amplitude is 7.257, which is approximately 7.26. The closest option is I:7.5.

But perhaps the problem expects the answer to be 0. Let me think: if x=21 makes 5x=105, which is an odd multiple of π/2, then cos(105)=0. But 105= nπ/2 →n=210/π≈66.87, which is not an integer. So cos(105)≠0. So option G:0 is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that 5x=105=33π + (105-33π)=105-103.67=1.33 radians. So cos(105)=cos(33π+1.33)=cos(π +1.33)= -cos(1.33)= -0.2419.

So the amplitude is 30*0.2419=7.257.

Thus, the correct answer should be approximately 7.26, which isn't an option, but the closest is I:7.5.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem intended to use a different method. Wait, perhaps the amplitude can be found by finding the nodes and antinodes. But that doesn't directly help here.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of cos(105). Let me try to compute it using a calculator:

Using a calculator, cos(105) ≈-0.2419.

So 30 * 0.2419 =7.257.

Thus, the correct answer should be approximately 7.26, which isn't an option, but the closest is I:7.5. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option F:9.27, but I don't see how that would fit.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I should compute 5x=105 radians, and then compute cos(105) as cos(105)=cos(105-33π)=cos(105-103.67)=cos(1.33). Now, 1.33 radians is about 76 degrees, and cos(76 degrees)=approx 0.2419. So 30 *0.2419=7.257.

Thus, the amplitude is approximately 7.26, but the options don't have that. So perhaps the intended answer is I:7.5, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is F:9.27, but I can't reconcile that with the calculations.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial step. Let me check the problem statement again.

The problem states y1=15 sin(3πt -5x) and y2=15 sin(3πt +5x). So the sum is 30 sin(3πt) cos(5x), as I did earlier.

So the amplitude at x=21 is 30 cos(105)=30*(-0.2419)= -7.257. The amplitude is 7.257.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the correct answer is I:7.5, as the closest option. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to round to one decimal place, making it 7.3, but that's not an option either.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the problem is using a different form, like y = 2A cos(kx) sin(ωt), which would have amplitude 2A cos(kx). But in this case, 2A=30, so 30 cos(5x). So the same result.

Thus, the correct answer should be approximately 7.26, but since that's not an option, I'll choose the closest one, which is I:7.5.

To determine the amplitude of motion at \( x = 21 \), we analyze the superposition of the two waves given by:

\[
y_1 = 15 \sin(3\pi t - 5x), \quad y_2 = 15 \sin(3\pi t + 5x)
\]

Using the trigonometric identity \( \sin A + \sin B = 2 \sin\left(\frac{A+B}{2}\right) \cos\left(\frac{A-B}{2}\right) \), the superposition simplifies to:

\[
y = y_1 + y_2 = 30 \sin(3\pi t) \cos(5x)
\]

The amplitude of the standing wave at any position \( x \) is given by \( 30 \cos(5x) \). Substituting \( x = 21 \):

\[
5x = 5 \times 21 = 105 \, \text{radians}
\]

To compute \( \cos(105) \), we note that \( 105 \, \text{radians} \) is equivalent to \( 105 - 16 \times 2\pi \approx 4.47 \, \text{radians} \) (since \( 2\pi \approx 6.283 \)). Thus:

\[
\cos(105) = \cos(4.47) \approx -0.2419
\]

The amplitude at \( x = 21 \) is:

\[
30 \times |\cos(105)| \approx 30 \times 0.2419 \approx 7.257
\]

Among the given options, the closest value to \( 7.257 \) is **7.5**.
