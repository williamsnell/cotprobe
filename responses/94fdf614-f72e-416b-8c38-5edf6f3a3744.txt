Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this economics question. Let me read it again.

The question says the economy is currently at full employment. They're asking what happens to GDP and the price level in both the short run and the long run if aggregate demand declines. Also, it's assuming flexible wages and prices.

Hmm, I remember that when the economy is at full employment, that means the unemployment rate is at the natural level, so the economy isn't producing beyond its capacity. Now, if aggregate demand (AD) decreases, what happens?

In the short run, I think that with flexible prices and wages, things might adjust differently. Normally, when AD falls, without flexible prices, we might have a recession with lower GDP and possibly lower prices if there's deflation. But since wages and prices are flexible, maybe the effects are different.

Wait, but the economy is at full employment. So, if AD falls, would the economy adjust by reducing output? Or maybe, with flexible prices, the real GDP could stay the same because prices might adjust instead.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think about the Aggregate Demand-Aggregate Supply (AD-AS) model. At full employment, the economy is at the potential GDP, which is the vertical part of the AS curve. So, if AD shifts left, in the short run, with sticky prices, we'd have lower GDP and lower prices. But if prices are flexible, maybe the AS curve adjusts more.

Wait, no, the AS curve in the short run is upward sloping because of sticky wages. If wages are flexible, then in the short run, maybe the AS curve becomes more like the long run, which is vertical. But I'm not sure.

Wait, no, the short run AS curve is upward sloping because wages and prices are sticky. If wages and prices are flexible, then in the short run, maybe the economy can adjust more, leading to lower prices without affecting output. So, if AD decreases, with flexible prices, the economy might move along the same AS curve, leading to lower prices but the same GDP.

Wait, that makes sense. Because if prices can fall, then firms can lower prices to match the lower AD, keeping output the same. So in the short run, GDP remains the same, but the price level falls.

In the long run, the economy would adjust. If in the short run, prices have fallen, but with flexible wages, maybe in the long run, firms adjust production. But wait, at full employment, if AD falls, maybe in the long run, the economy would have lower GDP because resources aren't fully employed anymore. Or wait, no, because the economy was already at full employment. So in the long run, perhaps the economy would adjust to a lower price level but same GDP, but I'm not sure.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to break it down:

Short Run:
- Aggregate Demand decreases.
- Prices are flexible, so prices fall.
- Wages are flexible, so real wages adjust, allowing firms to maintain production.
- So GDP remains the same (full employment), but prices fall.

Long Run:
- In the long run, with flexible wages and prices, the economy can adjust to the lower AD.
- But since the economy was already at full employment, maybe the AD decline would cause the economy to adjust to a lower price level but the same GDP? Or perhaps the GDP would fall because of lower demand.

Wait, no. If the economy is at full employment, and AD falls, but in the long run, prices and wages adjust, so the economy would move to a lower price level but still at full employment. So GDP remains the same, but price level falls.

Wait, but that doesn't sound right. If AD falls, even with flexible prices, wouldn't GDP have to fall because there's less demand? Or maybe not, because if prices fall enough, the quantity demanded can stay the same.

Wait, let me think of it as the AD-AS model. At full employment, the AS curve is vertical at Y = Yp (potential GDP). If AD shifts left, in the short run with flexible prices, the economy moves down along the AS curve to a lower price level but same GDP.

In the long run, since the economy is already at full employment, shifting AD left just means a lower price level, same GDP. So both in the short and long run, GDP doesn't change, but the price level falls.

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is: SHORT-RUN GDP No change, SHORT-RUN PRICE LEVEL Falls; LONG-RUN GDP No change, LONG-RUN PRICE LEVEL No change. That doesn't fit because in the long run, the price level should still fall.

Alternatively, maybe in the long run, the economy adjusts to a lower price level but same GDP.

Wait, but the options don't have that combination. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options:

Option B: No change, Falls, No change, No change.

That would mean in the short run, GDP doesn't change, price falls; in the long run, both no change. But that doesn't make sense because in the long run, the economy should have adjusted, so perhaps the price level remains lower.

Wait, maybe in the long run, the price level adjusts further. Or perhaps I'm getting it wrong.

Wait another approach: If the economy is at full employment and AD decreases, with flexible prices and wages, in the short run, prices fall, and GDP remains the same because firms can lower prices instead of reducing output.

In the long run, with flexible prices and wages, the economy can adjust to the lower AD. So, in the long run, the price level would be lower, but GDP remains the same because it's at full employment.

But looking at the options, is there an option where both short and long run GDP are no change, and price level falls in both?

Option B: Short-run GDP no change, price falls; long-run same.

But option B says in the long run, both no change. That can't be right because in the long run, the price level should still be lower.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the long run effect. In the long run, if AD is lower, but the economy is at full employment, perhaps the price level falls, but GDP remains the same. So in the long run, GDP is no change, price level falls.

But none of the options have that. Let me look again:

Option B: Short-run GDP no change, price falls; Long-run same.

Option I: Falls, No change, Falls, Falls.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently. If the economy is at full employment, and AD decreases, with flexible prices and wages, in the short run, the price level falls, and GDP remains the same because firms lower prices instead of laying off workers.

In the long run, with flexible wages and prices, the economy can adjust. But since the economy was already at full employment, perhaps the lower AD would cause the economy to produce the same GDP but at lower prices. So, in the long run, GDP remains the same, and price level remains lower.

Wait, but the options don't have that. Let me check the options again:

Option B: No change, Falls, No change, No change.

That can't be right because in the long run, the price level should fall.

Option H: No change, Falls, Falls, No change.

No, that doesn't fit.

Option I: Falls, No change, Falls, Falls.

No, that doesn't fit either.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong. Maybe in the short run, with flexible prices, the price level falls, and GDP remains the same. In the long run, the economy adjusts to lower GDP because demand is lower, but since it's at full employment, perhaps not. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe in the long run, with flexible prices and wages, the economy can adjust to lower prices, but GDP remains the same because it's at full employment. So in the long run, GDP is no change, price level falls.

But looking at the options, only option B has short-run GDP no change, price falls; long-run both no change. But that doesn't make sense because in the long run, the price level should still be lower.

Wait, maybe in the long run, the economy is still at full employment, so GDP doesn't change, but the price level is lower. So the long-run price level falls, but GDP remains the same.

But looking at the options, none of them have that combination. Let me check the options again.

Wait, the options are:

A: Falls, No change, No change, Falls

B: No change, Falls, No change, No change

C: Falls, Falls, No change, Falls

D: No change, No change, Falls, Falls

E: Falls, Falls, Falls, Falls

F: Falls, Falls, No change, No change

G: Falls, Falls, Falls, No change

H: No change, Falls, Falls, No change

I: Falls, No change, Falls, Falls

J: No change, No change, No change, Falls

Hmm, none of the options have GDP no change in both short and long run, and price level falls in both. So perhaps I'm wrong.

Alternatively, maybe in the short run, GDP falls and price level falls because AD decreases. But with flexible wages and prices, maybe the economy can adjust so that GDP doesn't fall but prices do.

Wait, but if AD falls, even with flexible prices, wouldn't GDP have to fall because there's less demand?

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the concepts. Let me think again. If the economy is at full employment, and AD decreases, with flexible prices, the price level falls, and real GDP remains the same because the same quantity is demanded at lower prices. So in the short run, GDP no change, price level falls.

In the long run, with flexible wages and prices, the economy can adjust to the lower AD. But since it's at full employment, maybe the economy doesn't change in terms of GDP but the price level is lower. So in the long run, GDP no change, price level falls.

But none of the options have that. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe in the long run, the economy will have lower GDP because AD is lower, even though it's at full employment. But that doesn't make sense because full employment implies that all resources are used, so lower AD would cause prices to fall, not GDP.

Alternatively, perhaps in the long run, the economy's potential GDP adjusts, but that's not likely because potential GDP is about resources and technology, not demand.

Wait, maybe in the long run, with lower AD, the price level continues to fall, but GDP remains the same because the economy is still at full employment.

So in the short run:

SHORT-RUN GDP: No change

SHORT-RUN PRICE LEVEL: Falls

In the long run:

LONG-RUN GDP: No change

LONG-RUN PRICE LEVEL: Falls

But looking at the options, none have that. Option B is No change, Falls, No change, No change. So that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about the long run. Maybe in the long run, with lower AD, the economy can't sustain full employment, so GDP falls, but prices adjust. Or maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps in the long run, the economy adjusts to lower prices but same GDP because the AS is vertical.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me try to recall what happens when AD shifts left at full employment with flexible prices.

In the short run, prices fall, GDP remains the same.

In the long run, since we're already at full employment, prices have fallen, but GDP remains the same.

So the price level falls in both the short and long run, but GDP remains the same.

Looking at the options, that would be:

SHORT-RUN GDP: No change

SHORT-RUN PRICE LEVEL: Falls

LONG-RUN GDP: No change

LONG-RUN PRICE LEVEL: Falls

But none of the options have that. The closest is option B, which says in the long run, both no change, which doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe I'm wrong and in the long run, GDP falls because the economy adjusts to lower demand.

Wait, but if the economy is at full employment, how can GDP fall? It can't unless the economy is not at full employment anymore.

Hmm. Maybe I should think that in the short run, GDP remains the same and prices fall. In the long run, with lower prices, maybe the economy can produce more, but that doesn't make sense because we were already at full employment.

Alternatively, perhaps in the long run, the economy can't maintain full employment, so GDP falls, but prices fall as well.

Wait, but if the economy is at full employment and AD decreases, with flexible prices, the immediate effect is lower prices, same GDP. In the long run, maybe the economy adjusts to a lower price level, but same GDP because it's still at full employment.

But none of the options match that. So perhaps the correct answer is option B: No change, Falls, No change, No change. But that doesn't make sense because in the long run, the price level should fall.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating and the correct answer is option B. Let me think.

Wait, another approach: If the economy is at full employment, and AD decreases, with flexible prices and wages, in the short run, the price level falls, and output remains the same (GDP no change). In the long run, the economy adjusts to the lower price level, but since it's at full employment, GDP remains the same. So the price level falls in both the short and long run, but GDP remains the same.

But none of the options have that. So perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong. Maybe in the short run, with flexible prices, GDP falls because firms can't lower prices enough, so they reduce output. But that contradicts the idea of flexible prices allowing them to lower prices instead of output.

Alternatively, maybe in the short run, GDP falls and price levels fall. In the long run, the economy adjusts to lower GDP and lower prices.

But that would be option E: Falls, Falls, Falls, Falls. But that doesn't make sense because the economy was at full employment, so GDP shouldn't fall in the long run unless the economy's potential changes.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should look for a different approach. Let me think of the AD-AS model. At full employment, the economy is at Yp. If AD shifts left, in the short run with flexible prices, the economy moves to a lower price level but same Yp. So GDP no change, price falls.

In the long run, with flexible prices and wages, the economy is still at Yp, so GDP no change, but the price level is lower. So in the long run, price level falls, GDP remains same.

But again, none of the options have that.

Wait, perhaps the question assumes that in the long run, the economy will adjust to a lower price level, but since it's at full employment, GDP remains same. So the options don't have that, but perhaps the closest is option B: No change, Falls, No change, No change. But that doesn't make sense because in the long run, the price level should still fall.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is option B, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the answer is option I: Falls, No change, Falls, Falls.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should think of it differently. In the short run, with flexible prices, AD falls lead to lower prices and same GDP. In the long run, the economy adjusts to lower prices, but since it's at full employment, GDP remains same, so price level falls again. But again, no option matches.

Alternatively, perhaps in the long run, the economy can't sustain the same GDP, so it falls. But that would mean in the short run, GDP no change, price falls; in the long run, GDP falls and price falls.

Which would be option I: Falls, No change, Falls, Falls.

Wait, no, option I says SHORT-RUN GDP falls, which contradicts my earlier thought that GDP remains same.

I'm really stuck. Maybe I should go with the initial thought: in the short run, GDP no change, price falls; in the long run, same. But since no option matches, perhaps I'm wrong.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option B: No change, Falls, No change, No change. But that doesn't seem right because in the long run, the price level should still fall.

Alternatively, perhaps in the long run, the economy adjusts to lower prices and lower GDP because demand is lower. So in the long run, both GDP and price level fall. That would be option E: Falls, Falls, Falls, Falls.

But that doesn't make sense because the economy was at full employment, so GDP shouldn't fall unless the economy's potential changes, which it doesn't.

I think I'm going around in circles. Maybe the correct answer is option B: No change, Falls, No change, No change. But I'm not confident.
</think>

The economy is operating at full employment, meaning it is producing at potential GDP. A decline in aggregate demand (AD) with flexible wages and prices would lead to the following effects:

1. **Short-Run Analysis**:  
   - With flexible prices, firms can lower prices to match the reduced demand, allowing them to maintain production levels. Thus, GDP remains unchanged, but the price level falls due to deflation.

2. **Long-Run Analysis**:  
   - In the long run, with flexible wages and prices, the economy adjusts to the lower AD. However, since the economy was already at full employment, GDP remains unchanged, and the price level continues to fall as the economy settles into a new equilibrium.

Given the options, the scenario where GDP remains unchanged in both the short and long run, while the price level falls in both periods, does not exist. The closest match is **Option B**, which states that GDP remains unchanged, the price level falls in the short run, and there is no change in both GDP and the price level in the long run. While this does not perfectly align with the reasoning, it is the most plausible choice among the provided options.
