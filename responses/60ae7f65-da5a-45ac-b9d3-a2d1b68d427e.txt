Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let me read it carefully.

The question is: "Very rapid disposal of the body, before sundown on the day of the death, is typical of which religion?" The options are A through J, with various religions listed.

Hmm, I remember that some religions have specific practices regarding burial or cremation. Let me think about each option one by one.

Option A is Tao. I'm not too familiar with Taoist practices, but I don't recall them having such a specific requirement about the time of disposal. Maybe they do, but I'm not sure.

Option B is Jewish. I know that in Jewish tradition, burials are supposed to happen as quickly as possible, typically within a day of death. They avoid delays, especially from sunset to sunrise, which is a period called Shomer. So, the body is buried before sundown. That sounds like it matches the question.

Option C is Hindu. Hindus usually cremate the body, and it's often done within a day, but I think it's more about the timing related to the next day after death, but I'm not certain if it's before sundown on the same day. Maybe, but I'm not sure.

Option D is Baha'i. I don't know much about their practices regarding disposal. I think they might have specific guidelines, but I don't remember it being about before sundown.

Option E is Islam. Muslims typically bury their dead as soon as possible, usually within 24 hours, but I don't recall a strict requirement to be before sundown. It's more about the same day without unnecessary delay, but not necessarily before sundown.

Option F is Zoroastrianism. Zoroastrians have a unique practice where they expose the body to the elements, especially in a structure called a Dakhma. This process can take a long time, sometimes days or even weeks, as the body is left to decompose naturally. So that's the opposite of rapid disposal before sundown.

Option G is Sikhism. I'm not too sure about Sikh practices. I think they generally follow Hindu practices regarding cremation, but I'm not certain about the timing specifics.

Option H is Buddhism. Buddhists might cremate or bury the body, but I don't recall a strict requirement to dispose of the body quickly before sundown. It's more about respecting the body and the rituals, but the timing isn't as specific as the question suggests.

Option I is Christianity. There are many Christian denominations, and while some might prefer burial within a day, it's not a universal practice. Some might wait a few days, so I don't think it's typically before sundown.

Option J is Shinto. Shinto practices vary, but I don't think they have a specific requirement about the time of disposal before sundown.

Wait, going back to the Jewish option. I'm pretty sure that in Jewish tradition, the body is buried as soon as possible, often the same day, and the delay is avoided, especially during the night. The reason is respect for the body and the observance of certain rituals. They don't wait overnight, so it's done before sundown. That matches the question exactly.

So, putting it all together, the answer should be option B: Jewish.

The correct answer is B: Jewish. In Jewish tradition, burials are typically conducted as quickly as possible, often within the same day, and before sundown to avoid the Shomer period. This practice aligns with the question's requirement of rapid disposal before sundown.

Answer: B
