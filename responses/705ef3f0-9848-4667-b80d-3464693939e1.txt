Question:

What differences emerged with regard to theorizing on both sides of the Atlantic?

Options:

A: From a US perspective, it is common to regard the main voice of security to be external. The question of what should or what should not count as security issues and how to conceptualize security.
B: The European school is based on a hegemonic form of knowledge. Knowledge is conceived as the understanding of causal mechanisms in relation to the material on which they act.
C: The different forms of knowledge relate to a conflicting conception of the relationship to policy: the problem-solving tradition in US political science vs. the critical studies in Europe.
D: Theorizing has parallel theoretical forms of knowledge based on empirically substantiated cause-and-effect relationships.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about differences in security theory between the US and Europe. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking what differences emerged in theorizing on both sides of the Atlantic. The options are A through D. I remember that US and European approaches to security studies have some key differences, often tied to their academic traditions and policy orientations.

Option A says from a US perspective, the main voice of security is external. They focus on what counts as security issues and how to conceptualize them. That sounds familiar. US approaches, like neorealism or neoliberalism, often focus externally on state interactions, maybe things like military alliances or international relations. So they're more about defining what's a security issue from an external standpoint, like threats from outside.

Option B talks about the European school being based on hegemonic knowledge and understanding causal mechanisms. Hegemonic knowledge might refer to dominant theories or perspectives, perhaps more critical or postcolonial approaches. European security studies might be more about how power structures influence security, maybe more critical theory. But I'm not sure if this is the main difference highlighted in the question.

Option C mentions different knowledge forms relating to conflicting conceptions of policy. It contrasts problem-solving in US political science with critical studies in Europe. Problem-solving might mean focusing on practical solutions, like how to address a specific threat. Critical studies could involve more analysis of underlying structures and critique of existing policies. This seems plausible because US approaches might be more applied, while European ones might be more critical and theoretical.

Option D states that theorizing has parallel theoretical forms based on empirical cause-effect relationships. This sounds more about methods—using empirical data to find cause and effect. Both sides might do this, but I'm not sure if this is the main difference the question is pointing to.

Now, the question is about differences in theorizing. I think the main divide is between US focus on external security, like state-centric views, versus European approaches that might be more critical, looking at internal dynamics or power structures. So perhaps option A is highlighting the US perspective on external security. Alternatively, option C is about policy approaches—problem-solving vs. critical studies.

Wait, the question is about how they theorize, so maybe it's about the approach rather than just policy. US might be more about realpolitik and external threats, while Europe might be more critical, looking at how security is constructed and used as a tool of power. So option B talks about European school being based on hegemonic knowledge and causal mechanisms. That could mean they analyze how dominant powers (hegemonic) use security knowledge.

But I'm a bit confused. Another angle: the way they define security. US might be more about traditional state security, while Europe might include broader concepts like human security or critical theory. So option A's first part says the US regards the main voice of security as external. That sounds right. The second part of A is about what counts as security and how to conceptualize it, which is about defining the scope.

Alternatively, option C's contrast between problem-solving and critical studies might be about the purpose of theory—practical solutions versus critique of the system. That's a significant difference in approach.

I think the key here is that the question is about theorizing differences. So, I recall that US perspectives often focus on external security, like realism, while European approaches might be more critical and interdisciplinary, incorporating things like Foucault's biopolitics or Gramsci's cultural hegemony. So option B says the European school is based on hegemonic knowledge, which might align with a critical perspective that examines how knowledge is produced and maintained by dominant groups.

Wait, but option A is about the US perspective, so if the question is asking what differences emerged, perhaps the answer is that the US tends to see security as external, while Europe might have a different take. So option A would be the US approach, and the question is about the difference, so perhaps the correct answer is A because it's highlighting the US perspective on external security.

Alternatively, maybe the question is pointing towards the difference in how they approach policy. So problem-solving in the US versus critical studies in Europe. That's option C.

Hmm. I'm a bit torn between A and C. The question is about theorizing, so maybe it's more about the approach to theory rather than policy. So if the US is more about defining what's a security issue externally, that's a theoretical difference in how they conceptualize security.

Alternatively, if the difference is in the purpose of theory—problem-solving (US) vs. critical analysis (Europe), then option C would be correct.

I think the answer is A because it directly relates to how each side defines security issues, which is a core part of theorizing. The US focuses on external security, while Europe might focus more on internal or critical aspects. So the difference is in what counts as security and how it's conceptualized.

The question asks about the differences in theorizing on both sides of the Atlantic, focusing on how security is conceptualized and approached. Option A highlights the US perspective, emphasizing an external focus on security, while Option C contrasts problem-solving traditions in the US with critical studies in Europe. After considering the emphasis on theorizing and the core differences in how security is defined and approached, the answer aligns with Option A, as it directly addresses the US perspective on external security and the conceptualization of security issues.
