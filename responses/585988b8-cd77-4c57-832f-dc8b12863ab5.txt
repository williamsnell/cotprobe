Okay, so I've got this question about Hamming codes and calculating the number of parity bits required for different information lengths. Hmm, I remember from my studies that Hamming codes are used for error detection and correction in data transmission. Each parity bit helps in covering specific data bits to detect errors.

The question has two parts: a) when the information is 8 bits, and b) when it's 4 bits. I need to find how many parity bits are required for each case.

Wait, how do I calculate the number of parity bits needed in a Hamming code? I think it's based on the formula that determines the number of parity bits 'r' such that 2^r >= k + r + 1, where k is the number of data bits. Or maybe it's 2^r >= n, where n is the total number of bits including data and parity. 

Let me think again. Oh right, the formula is that the number of parity bits r must satisfy 2^r ≥ m + r + 1, where m is the number of data bits. So for each case, I'll plug in the values of m and solve for r.

Starting with part a) where m=8 bits. I need to find the smallest r such that 2^r ≥ 8 + r + 1. Let me try r=3. 2^3=8. 8 ≥ 8+3+1? No, 8 >= 12? No, that's not right. Next, r=4: 2^4=16. 16 ≥ 8+4+1 → 16 ≥13. Yes, that works. So r=4? But wait, I might be mixing up the formula. Another approach I remember is that the number of parity bits is the smallest integer r where 2^r is greater than the total number of bits including the parity bits. Wait, no, that's not quite it either.

Wait, maybe I should use the formula that the number of parity bits r is the smallest integer where 2^r is greater than the number of data bits plus r. So for m=8: 2^r > 8 + r. Let's test r=4: 16 > 8+4=12 → yes. So r=4. But I'm a bit confused because sometimes the number of parity bits can be found by the position where 2^r exceeds the data bits. Alternatively, I might be overcomplicating it.

Wait, perhaps another way is to think about the Hamming code structure. The total number of bits n is equal to m + r, where m is data bits and r is parity bits. And the condition is that 2^r ≥ n + 1, because each parity bit covers certain positions. Wait, no, that's not exact. Let me clarify.

The Hamming code requires that 2^r ≥ m + r + 1. So for m=8, 2^r ≥8 + r +1 → 2^r ≥ r+9.

Let me try r=4: 16 ≥4+9=13 → yes. So r=4. So part a) requires 4 parity bits.

Now for part b) where m=4. Using the same formula: 2^r ≥4 + r +1 → 2^r ≥ r+5.

Let me try r=3: 8 ≥3+5=8 → yes, because 8 ≥8. So r=3. So part b) requires 3 parity bits.

Wait, but looking at the options, option B says a)4, b)3, which matches my calculation. Option D says a)3, b)2, which doesn't match. So the correct answer should be option B.

Wait, but earlier I thought the answer was option D. Now I'm confused. Let me double-check.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Another approach: the number of parity bits r is the smallest integer such that 2^r ≥ (m + r) + 1. So for m=8, 2^r ≥8 + r +1 → 2^r ≥ r+9.

Testing r=4: 16 ≥4+9=13 → yes. So r=4. For m=4: 2^r ≥4 + r +1 → 2^r ≥ r+5.

r=3: 8 ≥3+5=8 → yes. So r=3. So part b) is 3, so option B (a)4, b)3) is correct.

Wait, but in the options, B is a)4, b)3. So the answer should be option B. But wait, looking back, I'm certain that for m=4, r=3. So option B is the correct choice.

The number of parity bits required in Hamming codes is determined by finding the smallest integer \( r \) such that \( 2^r \geq m + r + 1 \), where \( m \) is the number of data bits.

For part (a) with \( m = 8 \):
- Testing \( r = 4 \): \( 2^4 = 16 \geq 8 + 4 + 1 = 13 \). Thus, \( r = 4 \).

For part (b) with \( m = 4 \):
- Testing \( r = 3 \): \( 2^3 = 8 \geq 4 + 3 + 1 = 8 \). Thus, \( r = 3 \).

The correct answer is option **B**: a) 4 parity bits, b) 3 parity bits.

Answer: B
