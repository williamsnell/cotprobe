Question:

A state legislature has recently enacted a statute requiring all prospective voters in state electionswho wish to write-in a candidate to print the candidate's full name, and designate the office for which the candidate is running. The statute provides that such information must be written on the ballot in ink in an appropriate space. A write-in candidate for the office of Attorney General is a Chinese-American. The candidate is of the opinion that he needs a large turnout of Chinese voters in order to win the election. As a result, his campaign manager decides to mail to every registered Chinese voter a tear-off sticker, which bears the candidates name along with the office of Attorney General. Since many native Chinese people are not proficient in reading and writing English, the campaign manager believes that many of the voters will have difficulty writing the candidate's name and office on the ballot. As a result, the campaign manager has mounted an extensive media campaign to inform voters on how to apply the stickers to the ballot. Five months prior to the election an election official notifies the candidate's campaign committee that the tear-off stickers do not comply with the state statute. In her letter, the official explains that state election officials are of the opinion that it is necessary for potential voters to write the candidate's name in ink. Therefore, she concludes that the stickers do not comply with statutory requirements. Three weeks later, the candidate filed suit in federal district court against the election officials, claiming that their interpretation of the state statute violates the U. S. Constitution. Thereafter, one of the candidate's opponents filed suit in state court seeking to prevent state election officials from counting any write-in ballots with stickers. The state court has now scheduled a prompt hearing on this matter. In addition, the state court has indicated that it hopes to render a decision on the merits within the next three weeks. Which of the following statements is correct concerning the federal court's adjudication of the candidate's suit?

Options:

A: The federal court should remand the case to the state court to decide the constitutional issue presented.
B: The federal court should hear the case and make a ruling before the state court.
C: The federal court should refuse to hear the case because it presents a nonjusticiable political question.
D: The federal court should hear the case and defer its decision until after the state court's ruling.
E: The federal court should refuse to hear the case because it is a matter of state law.
F: The federal court should hear the case because the state statute potentially violates federal law.
G: The federal court should refuse to hear the case because it's a matter of electoral law.
H: The federal court should hear the case on the merits.
I: The federal court should refuse to hear the case as it lacks jurisdiction.
J: The federal court should refuse to hear the case because of the abstention doctrine.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which option is correct in this legal question. Let me read through the problem again and break it down step by step.

So, there's a state statute that requires write-in candidates to have their full name and the office they're running for printed on the ballot in ink. The candidate in question is a Chinese-American running for Attorney General. His campaign is using tear-off stickers with his name and the office, but the state election official says this doesn't comply because voters need to write the name in ink, not use a sticker.

The candidate sues in federal court, arguing the state's interpretation violates the Constitution. Then an opponent sues in state court to stop counting ballots with stickers. The state court is going to hear it soon and decide quickly.

The question is about the federal court's response. The options are about whether the federal court should hear the case, remand it, apply abstention, etc.

I remember from my studies that there's something called the abstention doctrine, which is when federal courts hold back from deciding a case if there's a pending state court case, especially if the state court could resolve the issue. Also, there's the concept of federal jurisdiction based on constitutional issues.

The candidate is suing in federal court, claiming a constitutional violation. So the federal court has jurisdiction because it's a federal question. But the other case is in state court, which is about whether the stickers are allowed under state law. The state court is going to decide on that quickly.

Now, the federal court's role when a state court is handling a related issue. I think the abstention doctrine, especially under the Supreme Court's decision in Colorado River Water Conservation District v. United States, tells federal courts to abstain if there's a pending state proceeding that could resolve the federal issue. This is to avoid duplication and give states the first chance to interpret their own laws.

So here, the state court is about to decide whether the stickers comply with state law. If they rule against the stickers, maybe that moots the federal issue. Plus, the state court's decision could clarify the state statute, which might make the federal constitutional challenge unnecessary or provide a better foundation.

Looking at the options, J says the federal court should refuse because of the abstention doctrine. That seems to fit. The other options: A says remand to state court, but the candidate is in federal court, so remand isn't applicable here. B says federal should hear first, but if the state is handling it, federal might wait. C says nonjusticiable political question, but this seems more about election law, which courts can handle. D says defer until state decides, which aligns with abstention. H says hear on merits, but maybe they shouldn't if state can decide first.

Wait, but the candidate's suit is about the state's interpretation violating the Constitution. So the federal court has jurisdiction, but under abstention, it might wait. The key here is that the state court is actively considering the same issue, so federal courts might abstain.

So the correct answer would be J: the federal court should refuse to hear the case because of the abstention doctrine.

The correct answer is J: The federal court should refuse to hear the case because of the abstention doctrine.
