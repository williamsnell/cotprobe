Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about alpha particles. Hmm, let's see. I remember that alpha particles are helium nuclei, so they have a charge of +2e. The question says it's doubly charged, which makes sense because each alpha particle has two protons, so charge +2 times elementary charge.

The mass of the alpha particle is given as 6.64 × 10^-27 kg. The energy emitted is 6.048 MeV. I think that energy refers to the kinetic energy because when particles are emitted, like in radioactive decay, they usually have kinetic energy. So I'll assume it's kinetic energy.

The first part asks for the velocity of the alpha particles. The second part wants the magnetic field that would bend them into a circle of radius 40 cm. I remember that when a charged particle moves perpendicular to a magnetic field, it moves in a circular path. The magnetic force provides the centripetal force.

Let me tackle each part step by step.

First, finding the velocity. I know that kinetic energy (KE) is (1/2)mv². So I can rearrange that to solve for velocity.

Given:
KE = 6.048 MeV
I need to convert that to joules because the mass is in kg. I remember that 1 eV is 1.602 × 10^-19 joules. So 1 MeV is 10^6 eV, which is 1.602 × 10^-13 J.

So 6.048 MeV is 6.048 × 1.602 × 10^-13 J. Let me calculate that.

6.048 × 1.602 ≈ let's see, 6 * 1.602 is 9.612, plus 0.048 *1.602≈0.0769, so total ≈9.6889. So 9.6889 ×10^-13 J.

Now, KE = (1/2) m v² → v = sqrt(2KE/m)

Plugging in the numbers:
KE = 9.6889e-13 J
m = 6.64e-27 kg

So v = sqrt( (2 * 9.6889e-13) / 6.64e-27 )

Let me compute the numerator first: 2 * 9.6889e-13 = 1.93778e-12.

Divide that by 6.64e-27 kg: 1.93778e-12 /6.64e-27 = (1.93778 /6.64) * 1e15.

1.93778 /6.64 ≈ 0.2918.

So 0.2918e15 = 2.918e14.

Now take the square root of 2.918e14. Let me think: sqrt(2.918e14) is sqrt(2.918) * sqrt(1e14). sqrt(2.918) is approx 1.708, and sqrt(1e14)=1e7. So 1.708e7 m/s.

Wait, but looking at the options, option F says velocity is 1.709e7 m/s. That's very close. So maybe that's the velocity part.

Wait, let me double-check the calculations because sometimes I might have made a mistake in the exponents.

Wait, 2 * 9.6889e-13 is indeed 1.93778e-12. Divided by 6.64e-27: 1.93778e-12 /6.64e-27 = (1.93778 /6.64) *1e15. 1.93778 ÷6.64 is approximately 0.2918, so 0.2918e15 is 2.918e14. The square root of 2.918e14 is sqrt(2.918)*1e7. sqrt(2.918) is about 1.708, so 1.708e7 m/s. So that's the velocity, which matches option F and G.

Wait, but looking at the options, F has velocity 1.709e7 and magnetic field 1.885 Wb/m². Option G has the same velocity but a different B. Hmm, but let's see what comes next.

Now, the second part is finding the magnetic field B that bends the beam into a circle of radius 40 cm (0.4 meters).

The formula for the radius is r = (mv)/(qB). Rearranging for B: B = mv/(q r).

We have m =6.64e-27 kg, v=1.708e7 m/s, q is the charge. Since it's doubly charged, q=2e, where e is 1.602e-19 C.

So plugging in the values:

B = (6.64e-27 kg * 1.708e7 m/s) / (2 * 1.602e-19 C * 0.4 m)

Let me compute numerator and denominator separately.

Numerator: 6.64e-27 *1.708e7 = 6.64 *1.708 = approx 11.33, and exponents: 1e-27 *1e7 =1e-20. So numerator ≈11.33e-20 = 1.133e-19.

Denominator: 2 *1.602e-19 *0.4 = 2*0.4=0.8, 0.8*1.602e-19=1.2816e-19.

So B = (1.133e-19) / (1.2816e-19) ≈ 0.884 Tesla.

Wait, 1.133 /1.2816 is approximately 0.884. So B ≈0.884 T, which is 0.884 Wb/m².

Looking back at the options, option A says B is 0.885 Wb/m² and velocity is 1.209e7. That's not matching because our velocity is 1.708e7. So which option has velocity around 1.709e7 and B around 0.885?

Looking at the options, option G has velocity 1.709e7 and B 0.885 Wb/m². So that would be the correct answer.

Wait, but earlier I thought option F's velocity matched, but F's B is higher. So the correct pair is velocity 1.709e7 and B 0.885, which is option G.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation for B. Did I compute it correctly?

Let me recalculate B:

m =6.64e-27 kg, v=1.708e7 m/s.

q =2 * 1.602e-19 C =3.204e-19 C.

r=0.4 m.

So B = (m v)/(q r) = (6.64e-27 *1.708e7) / (3.204e-19 *0.4)

Compute numerator: 6.64e-27 *1.708e7 = 6.64 *1.708 = approximately 11.33, and exponents: 1e-27 *1e7 =1e-20. So 11.33e-20 = 1.133e-19.

Denominator: 3.204e-19 *0.4 = (3.204 *0.4)=1.2816e-19.

So B = 1.133e-19 / 1.2816e-19 = 0.884 T. So yes, approximately 0.884 T, which rounds to 0.885 T.

So the velocity is 1.709e7 m/s and B is 0.885 Wb/m², which is option G.

The velocity of the alpha particles is calculated using the kinetic energy formula \( KE = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 \), which gives \( v = \sqrt{\frac{2KE}{m}} \). Converting the energy to joules and solving, the velocity is found to be approximately \( 1.709 \times 10^7 \, \text{m/s} \). For the magnetic field \( B \), the radius formula \( r = \frac{mv}{qB} \) is used, rearranged to \( B = \frac{mv}{qr} \). Substituting the values, \( B \) is calculated to be approximately \( 0.885 \, \text{Wb/m}^2 \). The correct option is G.
