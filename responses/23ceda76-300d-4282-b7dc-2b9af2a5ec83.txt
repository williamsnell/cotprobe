Question:

Draw one card at random from a standard deck of cards. The sample space $S$ is the collection of the 52 cards. Assume that the probability set function assigns $1 / 52$ to each of the 52 outcomes. Let
$$
\begin{aligned}
A & =\{x: x \text { is a jack, queen, or king }\}, \\
B & =\{x: x \text { is a } 9,10, \text { or jack and } x \text { is red }\}, \\
C & =\{x: x \text { is a club }\}, \\
D & =\{x: x \text { is a diamond, a heart, or a spade }\} .
\end{aligned}
$$

Options:

A: $\frac{14}{52}$
B: $\frac{12}{52}$
C: $\frac{13}{52}$

Okay, so I have this probability problem here, and I need to find P(A), which is the probability of drawing a Jack, Queen, or King from a standard deck. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that a standard deck has 52 cards. Each card is equally likely to be drawn, so each has a probability of 1/52. That makes sense because the probability set function assigns 1/52 to each outcome.

Now, event A is defined as {x: x is a jack, queen, or king}. So I need to count how many such cards there are in the deck.

I know that in a standard deck, there are 4 suits: hearts, diamonds, clubs, and spades. Each suit has 13 cards, ranging from Ace to King. So each rank (like Jack, Queen, King) has one card per suit.

Let me break it down. There are 3 face cards per suit: Jack, Queen, and King. Since there are 4 suits, that would be 3 cards/suit * 4 suits = 12 cards in total. Wait, that's 3 times 4, which is 12. So there are 12 cards that are either Jack, Queen, or King.

So the number of favorable outcomes for event A is 12. Therefore, the probability P(A) would be the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes, which is 12/52.

Let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Are there any other cards that might be considered as Jack, Queen, or King? No, because each of these titles is specific. For example, Ace is a separate rank, not a face card. So it's just the three face cards per suit, times four suits.

Wait, but sometimes people might confuse whether the King is the highest card, but I think that's correct. So 3 per suit times 4 suits is indeed 12.

Looking at the options, option B is 12/52, which matches my calculation. So I think that's the correct answer.

The probability P(A) is calculated by dividing the number of favorable outcomes (12 Jacks, Queens, and Kings) by the total number of possible outcomes (52 cards). Thus, P(A) = 12/52.

Answer: B
