Question:

An 18-year-old primigravid woman comes for her initial prenatal visit at 16 weeks' gestation. She is not sure about the date of her last menstrual period but says that the pregnancy probably occurred immediately after she stopped taking oral contraceptives 5 months ago. Maternal serum α-fetoprotein (MSAFP) concentration is increased to 3 multiples of the median. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?

Options:

A: Amniocentesis for measurement of α-fetoprotein concentration
B: Immediate cesarean section
C: Hormone therapy to balance MSAFP levels
D: Monitor patient without taking action
E: Triple screening for MSAFP, serum β-hCG, and serum estriol concentrations
F: Administer a pregnancy test
G: Prescribe oral contraceptives
H: Ultrasonography
I: Repeat measurement of MSAFP concentration
J: Conduct a pelvic exam

Answer:

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about prenatal management. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I might miss some points, but I'll think it through.

The question is about an 18-year-old primigravid woman who's come in for her first prenatal visit at 16 weeks' gestation. She's not sure about the date of her last menstrual period (LMP), but she thinks the pregnancy happened right after she stopped taking oral contraceptives five months ago. Her MSAFP (maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein) is elevated to 3 multiples of the median. The options are from A to J, and I need to pick the most appropriate next step.

First, I need to understand what MSAFP is. I remember that α-fetoprotein is a protein produced by the fetus, and it's usually measured in maternal blood. It's often part of the triple screen or quad screen tests. Elevated MSAFP can be a marker for certain conditions like neural tube defects or Down syndrome. But wait, I think higher levels might also be associated with other issues, maybe even multiple pregnancies or if the baby is macrosomic.

In this case, the MSAFP is 3 MoM, which is significantly elevated. The question is what to do next. The options are various tests and actions.

Looking at the options:

A: Amniocentesis for measurement of α-fetoprotein concentration. I think amniocentesis is a diagnostic test where they take amniotic fluid to measure AFP levels and maybe do chromosomal analysis. But is this the next step? I'm not sure. Maybe it's an option when there's a high risk for a genetic disorder.

B: Immediate cesarean section. That seems drastic. Why would an elevated MSAFP lead to a C-section? I don't think that's the standard approach unless there's a specific indication for delivery, which I don't see here.

C: Hormone therapy to balance MSAFP levels. I don't recall any hormone treatments used to adjust AFP levels. AFP is a fetal product, so I don't think maternal hormones can change that.

D: Monitor patient without taking action. Monitoring is always a possibility, but given the elevated AFP, maybe more evaluation is needed before just observing.

E: Triple screening for MSAFP, serum β-hCG, and serum estriol. Wait, the triple screen typically includes AFP, hCG, and estriol. Since she already had the MSAFP measured, maybe the triple screen is part of initial evaluation, but if the MSAFP is already high, perhaps they need more info. Or maybe they should do the triple screen to confirm the levels.

F: Administer a pregnancy test. She's already pregnant, so this seems redundant.

G: Prescribe oral contraceptives. That doesn't make sense in this context; she's already pregnant, and oral contraceptives are for birth control.

H: Ultrasonography. Ultrasound is often used to confirm gestational age, check for multiple pregnancies, and look for anomalies. Maybe they should do an ultrasound to see if the dates are accurate and check for other issues.

I: Repeat measurement of MSAFP concentration. Could it be a false positive? Maybe repeat the test to confirm the elevated levels. Lab errors can happen, so repeating might be a good idea before proceeding further.

J: Conduct a pelvic exam. A pelvic exam is part of routine prenatal care, but I don't think it's directly related to elevated AFP.

So now, the main options seem to be H (ultrasound), I (repeat MSAFP), E (triple screen), and A (amniocentesis). 

I remember that in cases of elevated AFP, the first steps are usually to confirm the gestational age via ultrasound because if the baby is older than expected, the AFP levels can appear high. For example, if the mother's dates are off, and the baby is actually more developed, the AFP might be higher than expected for the calculated gestational age. So, an ultrasound to reassess the gestational age is often done first.

Alternatively, repeating the MSAFP could be to rule out a lab error, but if it's consistently elevated, further testing like amniocentesis or triple screen might be considered for conditions like neural tube defects or chromosomal abnormalities.

The triple screen (E) might be part of the initial assessment, but since MSAFP is already high, perhaps the next step after confirming the gestational age (with ultrasound) would be to do the triple screen or amnio.

Wait, but the question is about the next step. So, if she's at 16 weeks, they might not have done the initial triple screen yet. Or maybe they have, but her MSAFP is elevated. So, the options are H, I, E, or A.

Another point: the woman's LMP is uncertain. She stopped oral contraceptives five months ago, so her conception could be within that timeframe. Without an accurate LMP, the gestational age might be uncertain. So, an ultrasound to determine the correct gestational age and confirm if it's a singleton or multiple pregnancy would be crucial.

If the ultrasound shows that the gestational age is actually later than the LMP would suggest, the AFP might not be elevated. For example, if she's actually 18 weeks instead of 16, the AFP level could be within normal limits for that age, but the calculation was based on an earlier gestational age, making it seem elevated.

So, the first step would be to get an accurate assessment of the gestational age, which is done via ultrasound (option H). Once the gestational age is confirmed, they can reassess the AFP level in the context of the correct age. If it's still elevated, then further tests like amniocentesis or triple screen would be considered.

Alternatively, option I is to repeat the MSAFP. Maybe they should check if the initial result was a fluke. But I think confirming the gestational age is more urgent because it can change the interpretation of the AFP level.

So, putting it all together, the most appropriate next step would be to perform an ultrasound to confirm the gestational age and rule out multiple pregnancies or other anomalies.

The most appropriate next step in management is to perform an ultrasonography to confirm the gestational age and rule out multiple pregnancies or other anomalies. This is crucial because the elevated MSAFP levels could be due to an inaccurate gestational age calculation. Ultrasound will provide accurate information to reassess the AFP level and guide further decisions.

Answer: H
