Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here, and I need to figure out the entropy change when one kg of water falls into a lake. Hmm, let's break it down step by step. 

First, the problem says that the water, the lake, and the air are all at 20°C. The water is initially 100 meters above the lake, so it's going to fall and mix with the lake. I need to find the entropy change associated with this process.

Wait, entropy change... I remember that entropy is a measure of disorder, and when a process occurs, the entropy of the universe should increase, especially if it's irreversible. But in this case, the water is falling into the lake, mixing, and coming to equilibrium. So probably an increase in entropy.

But wait, how do I calculate the entropy change? I think the formula for entropy change when heat is transferred is ΔS = Q_rev / T, where Q_rev is the heat in a reversible process and T is the temperature in Kelvin.

But wait, in this case, the process is the water falling. Since water is in free fall, it's converting potential energy into kinetic energy, and then when it hits the lake, that kinetic energy becomes heat due to the inelastic collision. So, the water will mix with the lake, and the heat generated will raise the temperature of both the water and the lake. But wait, the problem says everything is already at 20°C, so does the temperature change? Or is the heat just dissipated without changing the temperature?

Wait, the lake is very large. Oh, right! The lake is so large that any heat added won't change its temperature. So the water's kinetic energy gets transferred into the lake, but since the lake's temp doesn't change, the entropy change comes from the heat transfer into the lake, which is an irreversible process. Or maybe it's the mixing entropy?

Wait, no. The water falls, so the potential energy is converted into heat. Since the lake is at the same temperature as the water, the heat will just be transferred into the surroundings without any temperature change. So the entropy change would be the heat generated divided by the temperature, right?

But wait, the water is in free fall, so its potential energy is mgh. Here, m is 1 kg, g is 9.8 m/s², h is 100 m. So the potential energy lost is mgh = 1 * 9.8 * 100 = 980 J. That energy converts into heat when it falls into the lake.

Since the lake is at 20°C, which is 293.15 K, the entropy change would be the heat (980 J) divided by the temperature (293.15 K). Let me calculate that: 980 / 293.15 ≈ 3.343 J/K.

Looking at the options, option G is 3.346 J/K, which is very close to this value. So that must be the answer.

Wait, but what about the entropy change of the water itself? The water was initially at rest, and then it's moving, but when it falls, it gains kinetic energy, which then becomes heat. But since the water's temperature doesn't change (because the lake is large), the entropy change due to the heat transfer is already accounted for by the lake's entropy increase.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the process involves two parts: the conversion of potential energy to heat and the mixing of the water into the lake, which might contribute to entropy. Wait, but since the lake is very large, the mixing effect might be negligible compared to the heat transfer. Or does the gravitational potential energy contribute to entropy?

Wait, another approach: The process is the water falling and hitting the lake. The potential energy is converted into heat, which is transferred to the lake. Since the lake is at the same temperature as the water, the entropy change of the lake is Q/T, where Q is the heat added. The entropy change of the water would be... Well, if the water doesn't change temperature, does its entropy change? Wait, when the water falls, it gains kinetic energy but loses potential energy. Then, when it falls into the lake, the kinetic energy is dissipated as heat, which might increase the entropy of the lake.

But since the lake is so big, the temperature doesn't change, so the heat Q is 980 J. The entropy change ΔS = Q / T = 980 / 293.15 ≈ 3.343 J/K, which matches option G.

Alternatively, if the process is considered as the water going from height h to 0, the potential energy is converted into heat, which then increases the entropy of the lake. So the entropy change is indeed 980 / 293.15 ≈ 3.343, so option G is correct.
</think>

The entropy change is calculated by considering the potential energy of the water converting into heat upon falling into the lake. The heat generated, \( Q = mgh = 1 \, \text{kg} \times 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \times 100 \, \text{m} = 980 \, \text{J} \), is transferred to the lake at 20°C (293.15 K). The entropy change is \( \Delta S = Q / T = 980 \, \text{J} / 293.15 \, \text{K} \approx 3.343 \, \text{J/K} \), which corresponds to option G.
