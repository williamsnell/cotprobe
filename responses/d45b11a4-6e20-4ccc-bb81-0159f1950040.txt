Okay, so I've got this question about diffusion in a mild steel rod. Hmm, let's see what it's asking for. I remember that diffusion equations are used to model how concentrations change over time. The question involves a steel rod that's been placed in a carbonaceous substance. The initial carbon concentration is 0.22% by weight, and at equilibrium, the surface concentration is 1.4%. We need to find the time it takes for a point 0.15 cm below the surface to reach 0.78% carbon.

Alright, I think this is a case of Fick's second law, which deals with diffusion through a medium. The basic equation I remember is the error function solution for a semi-infinite solid with a constant surface concentration. The formula should look something like this:

\[ \frac{x}{2\sqrt{D t}} \text{erf}^{-1}\left( \frac{2(c - c_0)}{c_e - c_0} \right) = \text{error function expression} \]

Wait, let me get the variables straight. Here, x is the distance from the surface, D is the diffusivity, t is time, c is the concentration at a point x and time t, c0 is the initial concentration, and ce is the equilibrium concentration.

So plugging in the values: x is 0.15 cm. D is given as 5.7e-6 cm²/sec. Initial concentration c0 is 0.22%, and the target concentration c is 0.78%, with ce being 1.4%.

Wait, but wait, let me make sure I'm using the correct formula. The equation I should use is probably the one for a constant surface concentration, which is:

\[ \frac{x}{2\sqrt{D t}} \text{erf}^{-1}\left( \frac{2(c - c_0)}{c_e - c_0} \right) = 1 \]

Wait, no, actually the formula should be:

\[ \frac{x}{2\sqrt{D t}} \text{erf}^{-1}\left( \frac{2(c - c_0)}{c_e - c_0} \right) = 1 \]

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the terms. Let me think again. The general solution for Fick's second law when the surface is held at a constant concentration is:

\[ \frac{x}{2\sqrt{D t}} \text{erf}^{-1}\left( \frac{c - c_0}{(c_e - c_0)/2} \right) = 1 \]

Wait, no, maybe it's better to set it up correctly. The correct form is:

\[ \frac{x}{2\sqrt{D t}} \text{erf}^{-1}\left( \frac{2(c - c_0)}{c_e - c_0} \right) = 1 \]

Yes, that's right. Because when c approaches ce, the erf function approaches 1. So let's plug in the numbers.

First, calculate the numerator inside the erf inverse: (c - c0) is 0.78% - 0.22% = 0.56%. The denominator is (ce - c0) = 1.4% - 0.22% = 1.18%. So 2*(0.56%) / 1.18% = (1.12)/1.18 ≈ 0.9444.

So the argument inside erf^{-1} is approximately 0.9444. Now, I need to find erf^{-1}(0.9444). From standard error function tables, erf^{-1}(0.9444) is approximately 0.9444. Wait, no, wait. Let me recall: erf(0.9444) is about 0.9444? Wait no, I think I'm getting mixed up.

Wait, erf is a function where erf(z) is the integral from 0 to z of 2/√π e^{-t²} dt. So erf(0) = 0, erf(∞) approaches 1. So if I have erf(z) = 0.9444, then z is the value such that erf(z)=0.9444. From tables, or using a calculator, erf(z)=0.9444 corresponds to z≈ 0.9594. Wait, perhaps I should check a table for erf inverse.

Alternatively, I can remember that erf(0.95) is around 0.7707, erf(1.0) is about 0.8427, erf(1.1) is around 0.8821, erf(1.2) is 0.9103, erf(1.3) is 0.9340, erf(1.4) is 0.9523. Wait, no, maybe I'm getting it wrong. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use an approximate formula or calculator.

Wait, let me think. I'm trying to find z where erf(z) = 0.9444. Let's see, from standard erf tables, erf(1.1) is 0.8821, erf(1.2) is 0.9103, erf(1.3) is 0.9340, erf(1.35)=0.9406, erf(1.375)=0.9442, so erf(1.375) ≈ 0.9442, which is very close to 0.9444. So z ≈ 1.375.

So, erf^{-1}(0.9444) ≈ 1.375.

Now, plug into the equation:

x/(2√(D t)) * 1.375 = 1

We can rearrange to solve for t:

t = (x^2 * (1.375)^2) / (4 D)

Wait, let me make sure. Rearranging the equation:

x/(2√(D t)) * 1.375 = 1

=> √(D t) = (x * 1.375) / (2 * 1)

=> D t = (x^2 * (1.375)^2) / 4

So,

t = (x^2 * (1.375)^2) / (4 D)

Now, plugging in the numbers:

x = 0.15 cm

So x squared is (0.15)^2 = 0.0225 cm².

(1.375)^2 = 1.375 * 1.375 = Let's compute that. 1.3^2 is 1.69, 0.075^2 is 0.005625, and cross terms: 2*(1.3)*(0.075) = 0.195. So total is 1.69 + 0.195 + 0.005625 = 1.890625. Alternatively, 1.375 * 1.375:

1.375 * 1 = 1.375

1.375 * 0.3 = 0.4125

1.375 * 0.07 = 0.09625

1.375 * 0.005 = 0.006875

Adding them up: 1.375 + 0.4125 = 1.7875; +0.09625=1.88375; +0.006875=1.890625. So yes, (1.375)^2 = 1.890625.

So numerator is 0.0225 * 1.890625 ≈ 0.042534375 cm².

Denominator is 4 * D = 4 *5.7e-6 cm²/sec = 2.28e-5 cm²/sec.

So t = 0.042534375 / 2.28e-5 ≈ ?

Let me compute that.

First, 0.042534375 / 2.28e-5 = ?

Divide 0.042534375 by 0.0000228.

Well, 0.042534375 ÷ 0.0000228 = ?

Let me compute it as 42534.375e-6 ÷ 22.8e-6.

So 42534.375 / 22.8 = let's see.

22.8 * 1860 = ?

22.8 * 1000=22800

22.8 * 800=18240 → 22800+18240=41040

22.8 * 60=1368 → 41040+1368=42408.

So 22.8 *1860=42408.

But 42534.375 is 126.375 more than 42408.

So 126.375 /22.8 ≈ Let's see, 22.8 *5=114, so 5.5 → 22.8*5.5= 125.4. So 126.375-125.4=0.975, so 5.5 + (0.975/22.8) ≈ 5.5 + 0.0428 ≈5.5428.

So total is 1860 +5.5428≈1865.5428.

So approximately 1865.54 seconds.

Convert seconds to hours: 1865.54 / 3600 ≈ 0.5182 hours.

Wait, that's about 0.518 hours, which is approximately 0.52 hours.

Looking at the options, option G is 0.55 hr, which is close. Hmm, but wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation somewhere.

Wait, let me double-check the steps.

1. Calculated the argument inside erf inverse as (0.78 -0.22)/(1.4 -0.22) = 0.56 / 1.18 ≈ 0.4746? Wait a second! Wait, wait. I think I made a mistake here. Wait, (c - c0) is 0.78 - 0.22 = 0.56, and (ce - c0) is 1.4 - 0.22 = 1.18. So 2*(0.56) / 1.18 = (1.12)/1.18 ≈ 0.9444? Oh wait, no, because the formula is (c - c0)/(ce - c0) multiplied by 2. So the argument is [2*(c - c0)] / (ce - c0).

Wait, but in my initial calculation, I think I messed up. Let me re-express this correctly.

Wait, the formula is:

\[ \text{erf}^{-1}\left( \frac{2(c - c_0)}{c_e - c_0} \right) \]

So, substituting the values:

2*(0.78 - 0.22) = 2*(0.56) = 1.12

Divide by (1.4 - 0.22) = 1.18 → 1.12 / 1.18 ≈ 0.9444.

So the argument is 0.9444, which is correct.

Then, erf^{-1}(0.9444) ≈ 1.375, as I thought earlier.

Then, plugging into the equation:

x/(2√(D t)) = 1.375 → √(D t) = x/(2*1.375) → √(D t) = 0.15/(2 *1.375) → 0.15/(2.75) ≈ 0.054545 cm.

Squaring both sides: D t = (0.054545)^2 → D t = 0.002975 cm².

Wait, no, wait: √(D t) = 0.15/(2*1.375) → 0.15/(2.75) = approximately 0.054545 cm.

So D t = (0.054545)^2 ≈ 0.002975 cm².

But D is given as 5.7e-6 cm²/sec.

So t = 0.002975 / (5.7e-6) → let's compute that.

0.002975 / 0.0000057 = ?

Divide numerator and denominator by 0.000001: 2975 / 5.7 ≈ 522.63 seconds.

Wait, that's different from what I did earlier. Wait, so where did I go wrong before? Oh, I think I messed up the rearrangement.

Let me try again. The equation after plugging in the values is:

x/(2√(D t)) * 1.375 = 1 → √(D t) = (x * 1.375)/(2*1) → √(D t) = (0.15 *1.375)/2.

Compute that:

0.15 *1.375 = 0.20625 → divided by 2: 0.103125 cm.

So √(D t) = 0.103125 cm.

Square both sides: D t = (0.103125)^2 = 0.0106328125 cm².

Now, D is 5.7e-6 cm²/sec, so t = 0.0106328125 / 5.7e-6 = ?

Calculate 0.0106328125 / 0.0000057 = ?

First, 0.0106328125 / 0.0000057 → same as 10632.8125e-6 / 5.7e-6 → 10632.8125 /5.7 ≈ 1865.4 seconds.

Convert seconds to hours: 1865.4 / 3600 ≈ 0.518 hours, which is about 0.518 hours, roughly 0.52 hours.

Looking back at the options, option G is 0.55 hr, which is the closest. Alternatively, perhaps my approximation of erf^{-1}(0.9444) as 1.375 is a bit off. Let me check a more accurate value.

Alternatively, maybe I should use a calculator for erf^{-1}(0.9444). Let me think. Using a calculator, erf^{-1}(0.9444) is approximately 1.375, but perhaps a more precise value is needed. Let me try to get a more accurate erf value.

Wait, from erf tables:

erf(1.37) ≈ 0.9404

erf(1.38) ≈ 0.9425

erf(1.39) ≈ 0.9445

So, erf(1.39)=~0.9445, which is very close to 0.9444. So z=1.39.

So if I use z=1.39, let's recalculate.

So, x/(2√(D t)) * 1.39 =1 → √(D t) = x/(2 *1.39) → x=0.15 cm.

So √(D t) = 0.15/(2*1.39) → 0.15/2.78 ≈ 0.054 cm.

Then, D t = (0.054)^2 = 0.002916 cm².

t = 0.002916 /5.7e-6 → 0.002916 / 0.0000057 ≈ 511.58 seconds.

Convert to hours: 511.58 / 3600 ≈ 0.142 hours, which is about 8.5 minutes. Wait, that can't be right because earlier I got 0.52 hours with z=1.375, and now with z=1.39, it's 0.142 hours. That's a big discrepancy. I must have made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, wait, no, I think I messed up the calculation again. Let me redo this part.

Wait, no, when I plug in z=1.39, the equation becomes:

x/(2√(D t)) * z =1 → √(D t) = x z / (2).

So, x=0.15 cm, z=1.39.

So √(D t)= (0.15 *1.39)/(2) → (0.2085)/2 = 0.10425 cm.

Then, D t = (0.10425)^2 = 0.010868 cm².

t = 0.010868 /5.7e-6 cm²/s → 0.010868 / 0.0000057 ≈ 1894.7 seconds.

Convert to hours: 1894.7 /3600 ≈ 0.5263 hours ≈ 0.526 hours.

Which is about 0.53 hours, which still rounds to around 0.53 hours.

Looking at the options, G is 0.55 hr, which is the closest.

Wait, but perhaps I should be more precise with the erf inverse value. Alternatively, maybe I can use the approximation formula for the error function.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for the time to reach a certain concentration in terms of the error function.

Wait, another approach: using the formula:

t = (x²) / (4 D) * [erf^{-1}((2(c - c0)/(ce - c0)))]²

So plugging in the numbers:

x = 0.15 cm

D =5.7e-6 cm²/s

c=0.78%, c0=0.22%, ce=1.4%.

So (2*(0.78-0.22))/(1.4-0.22)=2*(0.56)/1.18=1.12/1.18≈0.9444.

So erf^{-1}(0.9444)=z≈1.39.

So t = (0.15²) / (4 *5.7e-6) * (1.39)^2.

Compute each part:

0.15^2 =0.0225 cm².

4 *5.7e-6 =2.28e-5 cm²/s.

(1.39)^2=1.9321.

So:

t = (0.0225 / 2.28e-5) * 1.9321.

First, 0.0225 /2.28e-5 = 0.0225 /0.0000228 ≈ 986.73.

Multiply by 1.9321: 986.73 *1.9321 ≈ 1908.3 seconds.

Convert to hours: 1908.3 /3600 ≈0.53 hours, same as before.

So about 0.53 hours, which is approximately 31.8 minutes.

Looking at the options, the closest is option G: 0.55 hr, which is 33 minutes. So the answer should be G.
</think>

To determine the time necessary for a point 0.15 cm below the surface of a mild steel rod to attain a carbon concentration of 0.78%, we use Fick's second law for diffusion. The equation used is:

\[
\frac{x}{2\sqrt{D t}} \text{erf}^{-1}\left( \frac{2(c - c_0)}{c_e - c_0} \right) = 1
\]

### Given:
- \( x = 0.15 \, \text{cm} \)
- \( D = 5.7 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{cm}^2/\text{sec} \)
- \( c_0 = 0.22\% \)
- \( c = 0.78\% \)
- \( c_e = 1.4\% \)

### Step 1: Calculate the argument for the error function
\[
\frac{2(c - c_0)}{c_e - c_0} = \frac{2(0.78 - 0.22)}{1.4 - 0.22} = \frac{2(0.56)}{1.18} \approx 0.9444
\]

### Step 2: Find the inverse error function
Using error function tables or approximations, \( \text{erf}^{-1}(0.9444) \approx 1.39 \).

### Step 3: Rearrange the equation to solve for \( t \)
\[
\sqrt{D t} = \frac{x \cdot \text{erf}^{-1}(0.9444)}{2}
\]
\[
\sqrt{D t} = \frac{0.15 \cdot 1.39}{2} \approx 0.10425 \, \text{cm}
\]
\[
D t = (0.10425)^2 \approx 0.010868 \, \text{cm}^2
\]
\[
t = \frac{0.010868}{5.7 \times 10^{-6}} \approx 1894.7 \, \text{seconds}
\]

### Step 4: Convert seconds to hours
\[
t = \frac{1894.7}{3600} \approx 0.526 \, \text{hours}
\]

### Step 5: Match with the closest option
The calculated time is approximately \( 0.53 \, \text{hours} \), which is closest to option **G: 0.55 hr**.

ANSWER: G
