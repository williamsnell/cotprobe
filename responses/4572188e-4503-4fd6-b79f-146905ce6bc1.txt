Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these molarity calculations. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand it properly.

The question is: How many moles of HCl must be added to sufficient water to form 3 liters of a 2 M HCl solution? The options are from A to J, with the answers ranging from 1 mol to 10 mol. 

Hmm, right, molarity is a measure of concentration. I remember that molarity (M) is calculated by dividing the number of moles of solute by the volume of the solution in liters. The formula is M = moles / liters. So if I rearrange that, moles = M * liters. That makes sense because to find moles, I just multiply molarity by the volume in liters.

In this case, the volume of the solution is 3 liters, and the desired molarity is 2 M. So plugging those numbers into the formula, I should calculate 2 M * 3 liters. Let me do that math: 2 times 3 is 6. So that means I need 6 moles of HCl to make 3 liters of a 2 M solution.

Wait, but I should double-check to make sure I'm not mixing up any concepts. Sometimes I get confused between molarity and molality, but I think molality involves kilograms of solvent, not liters of solution. So here, since the question is about the solution's volume, molarity is the right term to use.

Also, the question says "sufficient water," which I think means that the volume of water added isn't the issue here. We're only concerned with how much HCl is needed to get the desired concentration in the solution. So adding 6 moles of HCl to enough water to make up 3 liters should give us the correct concentration.

Let me look at the options again. Option C is 6 mol, which matches my calculation. So I'm pretty confident that's the right answer. I don't think I made any mistakes here. Sometimes I might mix up the formula, but in this case, M = moles / volume, so moles = M * volume is straightforward.

To determine the number of moles of HCl needed, use the formula for molarity:  
M = moles / liters. Rearranging gives moles = M × liters.  
Given a 2 M solution in 3 liters:  
moles = 2 mol/L × 3 L = 6 mol.  

The correct answer is **C: 6 mol**.  

Answer: C
