Okay, so I've got this quartic equation: x⁴ - 18x³ + kx² + 200x - 1984 = 0. And I'm told that the product of two of its four roots is -32. I need to find the value of k. Hmm, quartic equations can be tricky, but maybe I can use Vieta's formulas here.

Wait, Vieta's formulas relate the coefficients of a polynomial to sums and products of its roots. Right, so for a quartic equation ax⁴ + bx³ + cx² + dx + e = 0, the sum of the roots is -b/a, the sum of products of roots two at a time is c/a, the sum of products three at a time is -d/a, and the product of all four roots is e/a.

In this case, the equation is x⁴ -18x³ +k x² +200x -1984 =0, so a=1. So, let's denote the roots as r1, r2, r3, r4.

From Vieta:
1. r1 + r2 + r3 + r4 = 18 (since -b/a = 18)
2. r1r2 + r1r3 + r1r4 + r2r3 + r2r4 + r3r4 = k
3. r1r2r3 + r1r2r4 + r1r3r4 + r2r3r4 = -200 (since -d/a = -200)
4. r1r2r3r4 = -1984 (since e/a = -1984)

We're given that the product of two roots is -32. Let's say r1 * r2 = -32. So, that's one piece of information.

I think I can set up some equations here. Let me try to factor the quartic into two quadratics if possible, since if two roots multiply to -32, maybe the quartic can be factored as (x² + ax + c)(x² + bx + d) where c*d = -1984 and something else. Wait, but maybe it's better to think of it as two quadratics, each with two roots.

Alternatively, maybe I can let the roots be r, s, t, u, with rs = -32. Then, the product of all four roots is r*s*t*u = -1984. Since rs = -32, then (-32)*t*u = -1984. So, t*u = (-1984)/(-32) = 62. So, t*u = 62.

Now, I have two products: rs = -32 and tu = 62.

Also, the sum of all roots is 18, so r + s + t + u = 18.

Hmm, maybe I can consider the quartic as (x² + px -32)(x² + qx +62). Let me check if this makes sense. Because rs = -32 and tu =62.

Expanding this: (x² + px -32)(x² + qx +62) = x⁴ + (p+q)x³ + (pq -32 +62)x² + (62p -32q)x + (-32*62). Let's compute the constants:

-32 * 62 = -1984, which matches the constant term in the original equation. So that's correct.

Now, let's equate coefficients:

1. The coefficient of x³ is (p+q) which should be equal to -18 (since the original equation has -18x³). Wait, no, wait: in the expansion, the coefficient is (p+q), and in the original equation, it's -18. So, p + q = -18.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the original equation is x⁴ -18x³ +k x² +200x -1984. So, the coefficient of x³ is -18, which in my expansion is (p + q). So, p + q = -18.

2. The coefficient of x² is (pq -32 +62) = pq +30. This should equal k. So, k = pq +30.

3. The coefficient of x is (62p -32q), which in the original equation is 200. So, 62p -32q = 200.

So now I have a system of equations:

1. p + q = -18
2. 62p -32q = 200

I can solve this system for p and q.

Let me solve equation 1 for q: q = -18 - p.

Substitute into equation 2:

62p -32(-18 - p) = 200
62p + 576 +32p = 200
(62p +32p) +576 =200
94p +576 =200
94p =200 -576 = -376
p = -376 /94
Let's compute that: 94*4=376, so 376/94=4. So, p= -4.

Then, q = -18 - (-4) = -18 +4 =-14.

So, p = -4, q = -14.

Then, k = pq +30 = (-4)*(-14) +30 =56 +30=86.

Wait, that's one of the options. Let me check the options: C is 86.

But wait, let me double-check all steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

First, I assumed the quartic factors into (x² + px -32)(x² +qx +62). The product of the roots r*s = -32 and t*u=62. Then, expanding, we get the correct constant term. The coefficient of x³ is p+q, which should be -18, so p+q=-18.

Then, the coefficient of x is 62p -32q. Set that equal to 200: 62p -32q=200.

Solved for p and q:

q = -18 -p.

Substituting: 62p -32*(-18-p) = 200.

Compute:

62p + 576 +32p =200.

94p +576=200.

94p=200-576= -376.

p= -376 /94= -4.

q=-18 - (-4)= -14.

Then, k = pq +30= (-4)(-14) +30=56+30=86, which is option C.

Wait, but let me check if this makes sense with the sum of roots.

The sum of roots is r + s + t + u =18.

From the factors (x² + px -32) and (x² +qx +62), the sum of roots from each quadratic is -p and -q.

So, the sum would be (-p) + (-q) = -(p+q) = -(-18)=18, which matches. So that's correct.

Also, check the product of roots: (-32)(62)= -1984, which matches.

And the coefficient of x is 62p -32q=62*(-4) -32*(-14)= (-248) + 448= 200, which matches.

So, all the coefficients match, so k=86, which is option C.

The quartic equation can be factored into two quadratics with roots whose products are -32 and 62. Using Vieta's formulas and solving the system of equations, we find k = 86.
