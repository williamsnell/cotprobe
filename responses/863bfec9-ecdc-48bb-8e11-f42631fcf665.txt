Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about Harlow's monkey experiment, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me start by recalling what I know about this topic.

Harlow's experiments were conducted in the 1950s and 1960s, right? I remember that he worked with monkeys, particularly rhesus monkeys, and his research focused on the effects of maternal deprivation. He wanted to understand the impact of being raised in isolation or with different types of surrogate mothers.

One of his famous experiments involved using two artificial surrogate mothers for the infant monkeys. One surrogate was made of wire and the other of soft cloth. The wire mother had a feeding mechanism, providing the monkey with food, while the cloth mother was just there for comfort. The key finding from this experiment was that the baby monkeys preferred the cloth mother over the wire one, even though the wire mother provided food. This showed that the monkeys preferred the mother that offered comfort and physical contact over the one that gave them food.

So looking at the options, I need to find which one aligns with this finding. Let's go through each option:

A: that language is a uniquely human skill. Hmm, no, that's more related to studies like those by Washoe or other language acquisition experiments with apes, not Harlow's work.

B: the importance of physical contact to development. Yes, this seems right because the experiment showed the preference for the cloth mother, indicating that physical contact is crucial for development.

C: that primates have a hierarchy based on physical strength. I don't think Harlow's experiment focused on hierarchy or strength; that's more about group dynamics in other studies.

D: that monkeys have a preference for inanimate objects. Well, the monkeys preferred the cloth mother, which is an inanimate object, but the point was about comfort and contact, not just preference for objects.

E: that monkeys can learn complex tasks. That's probably more related to other experiments, like those on tool use or problem-solving, not Harlow's.

F: ability to recognize themselves in mirrors. That's the mirror test, which I think was done by other researchers, like Gallup.

G: that primates can make and use tools. Again, that's a different area, like the work with chimpanzees using sticks or stones.

So the correct answer should be B: the importance of physical contact to development. Harlow's study demonstrated that the comfort and physical presence of a mother figure were more important to the monkeys than just the provision of food, highlighting the significance of touch and maternal care in their development.

The correct answer is B: the importance of physical contact to development. Harlow's experiment showed that monkeys preferred a surrogate mother made of soft cloth over one made of wire, even though the wire mother provided food. This highlighted the crucial role of physical contact and comfort in their development.

Answer: B
