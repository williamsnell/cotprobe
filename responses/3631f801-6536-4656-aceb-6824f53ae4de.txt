<think>
Okay, so I have this problem about a wet-bulb thermometer and figuring out the relative humidity of the air. Hmm, I remember that wet-bulb thermometers work by measuring the temperature of a wet bulb, which can tell you something about the moisture in the air. 

The problem says the wet-bulb temperature is 65°F, and the air is at atmospheric pressure with a temperature of 95°F. I think the key here is that when air passes over the wet bulb, it cools it down because of the evaporation of water. The difference between the dry bulb temperature and the wet bulb temperature should help me find the relative humidity.

Wait, right, the formula I recall is that the wet bulb temperature (Tw) is related to the dry bulb temperature (T) and the relative humidity (RH). The formula is something like Tw = T - (something involving RH and latent heat or maybe specific humidity). Or maybe it's a different approach, like using the dew point or psychrometric charts.

Oh, right! The psychrometric formula. The equation is: 

Tw = T - ( (L * RH) / (c_p * (1 - RH)) )

Wait, no, that doesn't sound quite right. Maybe it's better to use the formula that relates the difference between the dry bulb and wet bulb temperatures to the relative humidity. 

I think the formula is:

ΔT = T - Tw = ( (L * RH) ) / ( c_p * (1 - RH) )

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, I remember that there's a simpler way using the dew point equation. Let me think about the relationship between wet bulb temperature and relative humidity.

Another approach: The wet bulb temperature is the temperature of the air when the water evaporates from the bulb, and it depends on the relative humidity. At 100% humidity, the wet bulb and dry bulb temperatures would be the same because no evaporation occurs. At lower humidity, the wet bulb temperature is lower.

So, I think the formula to find relative humidity (RH) is:

RH = (Tw - Ts) / (T - Ts) ) * 100%

Wait, no, that can't be right. Or maybe it's:

RH = (e_s(Tw) / e_s(T)) ) * 100%

Where e_s is the saturation vapor pressure at temperature T. But I'm not sure how to calculate that without knowing the specific humidity or using a table.

Alternatively, the formula I remember is:

RH = ( (Tw - T) / (T - Ts) ) ) * 100%

Wait, that doesn't make sense because Tw is lower than T, so that would give a negative number.

Wait, I think the correct formula is:

RH = ( (Tw - T) ) / ( (T - Ts) ) ) * 100%

No, that doesn't make sense because Tw is lower than T. Maybe I should look for a formula that uses the difference between T and Tw.

Wait, I think the correct formula involves the露点 (dew point) or maybe the psychrometric equation. Another approach: using the formula for the wet bulb temperature in terms of relative humidity.

The formula is:

Tw = T - ( ( (2503 - T) * L ) / (4099 + 2.206 * L) ) * RH )

Wait, where L is the latent heat of vaporization, which is approximately 2435 J/g or about 2435 BTU/lb. But I'm not sure about the exact values here. Maybe it's better to use the approximation for the psychrometric equation.

Wait, I think the correct formula is:

Tw = T - ( ( (T - Tw) ) / ( (1.345 - 0.0356 * RH) ) )

Wait, that seems complicated. Maybe I should use the formula that relates the difference between T and Tw to the relative humidity.

Another approach: The formula for relative humidity when given T and Tw is:

RH = ( (T - Tw) / ( (T - Ts) ) ) ) * 100%

But that still doesn't make sense because Ts (dew point) is another variable we don't have. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should use the approximation where RH ≈ 100% when Tw ≈ T, which is obvious, and RH is lower when Tw is much lower. But I need a precise method.

Alternatively, I think there's a formula that directly relates the two temperatures to RH without needing the dew point. Let me think. Oh! I found a formula in my notes: 

RH = ( (Tw - Ts) / (T - Ts) ) * 100%

But again, Ts is the dew point, which is the temperature where the water vapor starts to condense. Without knowing Ts, I can't use this directly.

Wait, maybe I can express Ts in terms of Tw and T. Alternatively, perhaps using the psychrometric equation which relates T, Tw, and RH.

The psychrometric equation is:

Tw = T - ( ( (2503 - T) * L ) / (4099 + 2.206 * L) ) * RH )

But I'm not confident about the exact values here. Let me try to find another way.

Wait, I think the formula is:

ΔT = T - Tw = ( (L * RH) ) / ( c_p * (1 - RH) )

But I'm not sure about the constants. Let me check the latent heat and specific heat capacity.

L is the latent heat of vaporization of water. At body temperature, it's about 2435 J/g or 2435 kJ/kg. Specific heat capacity of air, c_p, is about 1.005 kJ/kg·K.

Wait, but I'm working in Fahrenheit. Do I need to convert temperatures to Celsius? Because the formula might require absolute temperatures in Kelvin.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a simplified formula for Fahrenheit. Let me think. I remember that the formula for relative humidity using wet and dry bulb temperatures is:

RH = ( ( (Tw - T) ) / ( (T - Ts) ) ) ) * 100%

But without Ts, I'm stuck. Maybe I should use a different approach.

Wait, I found a formula that uses the temperature difference between the dry bulb (T) and wet bulb (Tw) to find the relative humidity. The formula is:

RH = 100% * ( (T - Tw) ) / ( (T - Ts) ) )

But again, without Ts, which is the dew point, I can't apply it directly.

Alternatively, perhaps using the formula:

RH = 100% * ( (Tw - T) ) / ( (T - Ts) ) )

Wait, that doesn't make sense because Tw is less than T, so the numerator would be negative.

I'm getting confused. Maybe I should look up the formula again.

Wait, I think the correct formula is:

RH = ( (T - Tw) / (T - Ts) ) * 100%

But I still don't know Ts. Alternatively, maybe I can use the relation between the wet bulb temperature and the relative humidity directly.

Another approach: The wet bulb temperature can be calculated using the formula:

Tw = T - ( ( (2503 - T) * RH ) / (4099 + 2.206 * RH) )

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Maybe I should use the following formula:

Tw = T - ( ( (2503 - T) * RH ) / (4099 + 2.206 * RH) )

But I'm not sure about the exact coefficients. Alternatively, perhaps a simpler formula is used in such problems, like:

RH = ( (T - Tw) / (T - Ts) ) * 100%

But again, without Ts, I'm stuck.

Wait, maybe I can use the approximation that the relative humidity is approximately 100% when Tw is close to T, and lower otherwise. But in this case, T is 95°F and Tw is 65°F, which is a big difference, so the RH should be lower.

Looking at the options, the choices are A:26.1, B:34.5, C:10.4, D:15.6, E:38.6, F:42.9, G:47.8, H:50.2, I:28.3, J:21.7.

Hmm, I think the correct answer is around 21-28%. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula:

RH = ( (T - Tw) / (T - Ts) ) * 100%

But since I don't know Ts, maybe I can find Ts using the relation between T and Tw.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula that directly relates T and Tw without Ts. I think the formula is:

RH = ( (T - Tw) ) / ( (T - Ts) ) ) * 100%

But without Ts, I can't proceed. Maybe I should use the psychrometric formula in terms of T and Tw.

Wait, another approach: The formula for the wet bulb temperature is:

Tw = T - ( ( (2503 - T) * RH ) / (4099 + 2.206 * RH) )

But I think I have this backward. Let me rearrange it to solve for RH.

So, rearranging:

Tw = T - ( ( (2503 - T) * RH ) / (4099 + 2.206 * RH) )

Let me denote the denominator as D = 4099 + 2.206 * RH.

So, Tw = T - ( (2503 - T) * RH ) / D

Multiply both sides by D:

Tw * D = T * D - (2503 - T) * RH

But this seems complicated. Maybe it's better to use a trial and error approach with the options given.

Let me try option J: 21.7%. Let's see if that makes sense.

If RH=21.7%, then:

Tw = T - ( (2503 - T) * RH ) / (4099 + 2.206 * RH )

Plugging in T=95°F:

Tw = 95 - ( (2503 - 95) * 0.217 ) / (4099 + 2.206*0.217 )

Calculate numerator: (2408) * 0.217 ≈ 2408 * 0.217 ≈ 522.776

Denominator: 4099 + 2.206*0.217 ≈ 4099 + 0.478 ≈ 4099.478

So, (522.776) / 4099.478 ≈ 0.1275

So, Tw ≈ 95 - 0.1275 ≈ 94.8725°F, which is about 94.9°F. But the given Tw is 65°F, which is much lower. So this can't be right. So option J is too high, maybe.

Wait, that can't be. If RH is 21.7%, the wet bulb temperature should be much lower than T. But in this calculation, Tw is almost equal to T, which doesn't make sense. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, maybe I should use the formula in a different way. Let me check the formula again.

I think the correct formula is:

Tw = T - ( ( (2503 - T) * RH ) / (4099 + 2.206 * RH) )

But perhaps the latent heat value is in a different unit. Let me double-check the formula.

Alternatively, maybe the formula is:

Tw = T - ( ( (2503 - T) * RH ) / (4099 + 2.206 * RH ) )

But when I plug in RH=21.7%, I get Tw≈95 - (2408 * 0.217)/(4099 + 0.478). Let me recalculate:

2408 * 0.217 ≈ 522.776

4099.478 is the denominator.

522.776 / 4099.478 ≈ 0.1275

So Tw≈95 - 0.1275≈94.8725, which is way higher than the given 65°F. That's not matching. So I must have the formula wrong.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

Tw = T - ( ( (T - Ts) * RH ) / (1 - RH) )

But without Ts, I can't proceed.

Alternatively, maybe I should use the formula that relates the temperature difference to the relative humidity using the dew point.

The formula is:

Tw = Ts + ( (T - Ts) * RH ) / 100%

But I don't know Ts. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: I can use the formula for the dew point temperature (Ts):

Ts = T - ( ( (T - Tw) * 100% ) / ( (100% - RH) ) )

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, the formula is:

RH = ( (Tw - Ts) / (T - Ts) ) * 100%

But again, without Ts, I'm stuck.

Maybe I should use a psychrometric chart. At T=95°F and Tw=65°F, I can look up the relative humidity.

But since I don't have a chart in front of me, I'll have to think about typical values. A large difference between T and Tw indicates low RH. Let's see, for example, at 95°F, if the wet bulb is 65°F, the RH is probably around 20-30%.

Looking at the options, the choices are A:26.1, B:34.5, C:10.4, D:15.6, E:38.6, F:42.9, G:47.8, H:50.2, I:28.3, J:21.7.

Wait, I think the correct answer is around 21.7% (option J) or 26.1% (option A). Let me try to calculate using the correct formula.

The correct formula to find RH when given T and Tw is:

RH = ( (T - Tw) ) / ( (T - Ts) ) ) * 100%

But without Ts, perhaps I can approximate using the formula:

RH ≈ ( (T - Tw) ) / (T - (Tw + (T - Tw)/ (1.345 - 0.0356 * RH)) ) )

Wait, that seems too complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

RH = 100% * ( (T - Tw) ) / ( (T - Ts) ) )

But again, without Ts, it's hard.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula that directly relates T and Tw to RH without Ts, which is the psychrometric formula. The formula is:

Tw = T - ( ( (2503 - T) * RH ) / (4099 + 2.206 * RH) )

Let me rearrange this to solve for RH. Let me denote RH as r.

So,

Tw = T - [ (2503 - T) * r ] / (4099 + 2.206 r )

Rearranging,

Tw - T = - [ (2503 - T) * r ] / (4099 + 2.206 r )

Multiply both sides by denominator:

(Tw - T)(4099 + 2.206 r) = - (2503 - T) r

Let me plug in T=95 and Tw=65.

So,

(65 - 95)(4099 + 2.206 r) = - (2503 - 95) r

-30 (4099 + 2.206 r) = -2408 r

Multiply both sides by -1:

30 (4099 + 2.206 r) = 2408 r

Calculate 30 * 4099 = 122,970

30 * 2.206 r = 66.18 r

So,

122,970 + 66.18 r = 2408 r

Subtract 66.18 r:

122,970 = 2408 r - 66.18 r = 2341.82 r

So,

r = 122,970 / 2341.82 ≈ 52.47%

Wait, that can't be right because 52.47% is one of the options (H:50.2, close), but I thought the RH would be lower given the large temperature difference.

Wait, but according to this calculation, RH≈52.5%, which is close to option H:50.2%. But earlier I thought it should be lower. Did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Let me check the calculation again.

Tw =65, T=95.

So,

(65 -95) = -30.

So,

-30 * (4099 + 2.206 r) = - (2503 -95) r

Which is,

-30*(4099 + 2.206 r) = -2408 r

Multiply both sides by -1:

30*(4099 + 2.206 r) = 2408 r

Compute 30*4099: 30*4000=120,000; 30*99=2,970 → total 122,970.

30*2.206 r =66.18 r.

So,

122,970 +66.18 r = 2408 r

Subtract 66.18 r:

122,970 = 2408 r -66.18 r = 2341.82 r

Thus,

r=122970 / 2341.82 ≈ 52.47%

Hmm, that's about 52.5%, which is close to option H:50.2%. But that seems high because a 30°F difference between T and Tw suggests lower RH. Did I make a mistake in the formula?

Wait, perhaps I used the wrong sign. Let me check the formula again.

The formula is:

Tw = T - [ (2503 - T) * r ] / (4099 + 2.206 r )

But when T=95 and Tw=65, the difference is -30, so:

65 =95 - [ (2503 -95) * r ] / (4099 + 2.206 r )

So,

65 =95 - [2408 r / (4099 + 2.206 r ) ]

Subtract 95 from both sides:

-30 = - [2408 r / (4099 + 2.206 r ) ]

Multiply both sides by -1:

30 = 2408 r / (4099 + 2.206 r )

So,

30*(4099 + 2.206 r ) =2408 r

Which is what I did before, leading to r≈52.47%.

But that seems high. Let me check with the options. The closest is H:50.2%. But perhaps the formula uses different constants.

Wait, I think I might have used the wrong latent heat value. Let me check the correct formula.

Upon reviewing, I realize that the correct formula to use is:

Tw = T - ( ( (T - Twb) * 100% ) / ( 1.345 - 0.0356 * RH ) )

Wait, no, that's not right. Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is:

Tw = T - ( ( (T - Twb) * 100% ) / ( 1.345 - 0.0356 * RH ) )

Wait, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should use a different approach, like using the saturation vapor pressure.

The formula is:

e = 0.000658 * (10^( (23.84 - 2.565 * T) / T ) )

Wait, but that's for saturation vapor pressure in mmHg at temperature T in °F.

Wait, no, that formula might be in Celsius. Let me think.

Alternatively, the saturation vapor pressure at T can be calculated, and the actual vapor pressure at Tw can be found.

The formula for actual vapor pressure (ea) is:

ea = es * RH /100%

But es is the saturation vapor pressure at Tw.

Wait, no, because Tw is the temperature of the wet bulb, which is lower than T. So the actual vapor pressure is the same as the vapor pressure at Tw, which is es(Tw) * RH/100%.

But I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should use the formula that directly relates T and Tw to RH.

After some research, I found that the correct formula to calculate RH when given T and Tw is:

RH = ( (Tw - Ts) / (T - Ts) ) * 100%

But since I don't have Ts, I can't use this. Alternatively, another formula is:

RH = ( (T - Tw) ) / (T - Ts) ) * 100%

But again, without Ts, I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps using the approximation that RH ≈ (T - Tw) / (T - Ts), but without Ts, it's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula:

RH = ( (T - Tw) ) / ( (T - Ts) ) ) * 100%

But without Ts, I can't proceed. Maybe I should use a different approach.

Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me try plugging the RH options into the formula and see which one gives Tw=65 when T=95.

Let's try option J:21.7%.

Using the formula:

Tw = T - ( (2503 - T) * RH ) / (4099 + 2.206 * RH )

Plugging in T=95, RH=21.7% (0.217):

Tw =95 - ( (2503-95)*0.217 ) / (4099 + 2.206*0.217 )

Calculate numerator: 2408 * 0.217 ≈522.776

Denominator:4099 + 0.478≈4099.478

So,

Tw≈95 - (522.776 /4099.478 )≈95 - 0.1275≈94.8725°F

But we need Tw=65, so this is way off. So option J is not correct.

Wait, maybe I have the formula wrong. Let me check the correct formula again.

I think the correct formula is:

Tw = T - ( ( (2503 - T) * RH ) / (4099 + 2.206 * RH ) )

But with T=95 and Tw=65, let's solve for RH.

So,

65 =95 - ( (2503 -95)*RH ) / (4099 + 2.206 RH )

Subtract 95:

-30 = - (2408 RH ) / (4099 + 2.206 RH )

Multiply both sides by -1:

30 = (2408 RH ) / (4099 + 2.206 RH )

Multiply both sides by denominator:

30*(4099 + 2.206 RH )=2408 RH

122,970 +66.18 RH=2408 RH

122,970=2408 RH -66.18 RH=2341.82 RH

RH=122,970 /2341.82≈52.47%

So, RH≈52.5%, which is close to option H:50.2%.

But earlier I thought that a large temperature difference would imply lower RH, but according to the formula, it's about 52.5%. So the closest option is H:50.2%.

Wait, but that seems high. Let me check with another option. Let's try option A:26.1%.

Plugging RH=26.1% into the formula:

Tw=95 - (2408 *0.261)/(4099 +2.206*0.261)

Calculate numerator:2408 *0.261≈628.128

Denominator:4099 +0.577≈4099.577

So,

Tw≈95 - (628.128/4099.577)=95 - ~0.153≈94.847°F, which is way higher than 65. So option A is not correct.

Wait, but according to the formula, the RH is about 52.5%, which is closest to option H:50.2%. So perhaps the answer is H.
</think>

The problem involves determining the relative humidity (RH) of air at atmospheric pressure, given the dry bulb temperature \( T = 95^\circ \text{F} \) and the wet bulb temperature \( T_w = 65^\circ \text{F} \). The relationship between these temperatures and RH is derived from the psychrometric formula:

\[
T_w = T - \frac{(2503 - T) \cdot RH}{4099 + 2.206 \cdot RH}
\]

Rearranging this equation to solve for \( RH \) involves substituting \( T = 95^\circ \text{F} \) and \( T_w = 65^\circ \text{F} \), leading to:

\[
-30 = -\frac{2408 \cdot RH}{4099 + 2.206 \cdot RH}
\]

Simplifying further:

\[
30 \cdot (4099 + 2.206 \cdot RH) = 2408 \cdot RH
\]

Expanding and solving for \( RH \):

\[
122,970 + 66.18 \cdot RH = 2408 \cdot RH
\]

\[
122,970 = 2341.82 \cdot RH
\]

\[
RH \approx \frac{122,970}{2341.82} \approx 52.47\%
\]

This value is closest to option \( H: 50.2\% \). While the large temperature difference suggests a lower RH, the calculation indicates that the correct answer is approximately \( 52.5\% \), aligning with option \( H \).

Answer: H
