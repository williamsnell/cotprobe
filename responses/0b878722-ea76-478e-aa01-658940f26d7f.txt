Answer:
    
<think>
Okay, so I've got this question about calculating specific rotation and predicting observed rotations based on different conditions. Let me try to work through this step by step.

First, the question has three parts: (a), (b), and (c). Each part involves using the given concentration and the observed rotation under certain conditions to find specific rotation or predict a new rotation. The options are given from A to J, each with three values corresponding to parts (a), (b), and (c) respectively.

Let me start with part (a). The problem says that a portion of the solution in a 5-cm polarimeter tube causes an observed rotation of -1.2 degrees. I need to find the specific rotation of cholesterol.

From what I remember, specific rotation is calculated using the formula: 
α = (observed rotation) / (path length × concentration)

Wait, no, wait. I think the formula is specific rotation (α) equals the observed rotation (α_obs) divided by the product of the path length (l) and the concentration (c), but I'm a bit confused about the units here.

Wait, the concentration is given as 6.15 g per 100 ml. So that's 6.15 g/100ml. So in the solution, the concentration c would be 6.15 g per 100 ml, which is 0.0615 g/ml. Wait, no, wait. Because if it's 6.15 g per 100 ml, that's 6.15 g / 100 ml, which is 0.0615 g per ml. So the concentration is 0.0615 g/ml.

Wait, but wait, in the formula, the concentration is usually in grams per deciliter (g/dl) because specific rotation is often expressed per 100 ml. Wait, maybe I should convert the concentration to g/dl. 100 ml is 1 deciliter, so 6.15 g/100ml is 6.15 g/dl. Oh, that's right. So the concentration c is 6.15 g/dl. That makes sense because specific rotation is usually calculated using g/dl as the unit for concentration.

So the formula is:
α (specific) = α_obs / (l × c)

Where:
- α_obs is the observed rotation (-1.2°)
- l is the path length in decimeters (the polarimeter tube's length)
- c is the concentration in g/dl.

For part (a), the path length l is 5 cm, which is 0.05 dm (since 1 dm is 10 cm). So l = 0.05 dm.

So plugging in the numbers:
α = (-1.2°) / (0.05 dm × 6.15 g/dl)

Let me compute the denominator first: 0.05 × 6.15 = 0.3075.

So α = -1.2 / 0.3075 ≈ -3.902 approximately. Wait, but wait, that's not one of the options. Wait, let me check my calculation again.

Wait, 0.05 multiplied by 6.15 is indeed 0.3075. So -1.2 divided by 0.3075 is approximately -3.902. Hmm, but looking at the options, the specific rotation in the options is around -36 to -42. Oh wait, wait—did I make a mistake in the units? Because 5 cm is 0.5 dm, not 0.05. Oh, yes! I messed up the unit conversion. 5 cm is 0.05 meters, but in decimeters, 5 cm is 0.5 dm because 1 dm is 10 cm. Oh, right! So l is 5 cm = 0.5 dm, not 0.05.

So redoing that, l = 0.5 dm, c =6.15 g/dl.

So denominator is 0.5 ×6.15 = 3.075.

So α = (-1.2) / 3.075 ≈ -0.3902 radians? Wait no, no, specific rotation is in degrees, right? So α ≈ -0.3902 × something? Wait, that can't be right because the options are in the range of -36 to -42. Oh wait, wait—no, I must have made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recalculate.

Wait, 0.5 dm × 6.15 g/dl = 3.075.

So α = (-1.2) / 3.075 ≈ -0.3902. But that's about -0.39°, which is way too low. That doesn't make sense because the options have specific rotations around -39 to -42. So I must have messed up somewhere.

Wait, wait—hold on. Maybe I inverted the formula. Wait, maybe the formula is α = α_obs × (l × c). No, that can't be right because that would make the specific rotation larger, but I'm getting a much smaller value. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is α = α_obs / (c × l), but perhaps I have the units wrong.

Wait, let's think again. Specific rotation is a measure of the rotation per unit length and per unit concentration. The formula is α = α_obs / (l × c), where l is in decimeters and c is in g/dl.

So in part (a), α_obs is -1.2°, l is 5 cm = 0.5 dm, c is 6.15 g/dl.

So:

α = (-1.2) / (0.5 * 6.15) = (-1.2) / 3.075 ≈ -0.3902 degrees. But that's nowhere near the options given, which are in the range of -39 to -42. So I must have made an error in unit conversion or formula.

Wait a minute, perhaps the concentration is given as 6.15 g per 100 ml, which is 6.15 g/dl (since 100 ml is 1 dl). So that's correct. But then, for part (a), using l=5cm=0.5 dm, c=6.15 g/dl, and α_obs=-1.2°, then:

α = (-1.2) / (0.5 * 6.15) = (-1.2) / 3.075 ≈ -0.3902.

That's way too low. But all the options for part (a) are around -39 or so. So I must have made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula is α = α_obs / (l × c), but the units for l are in cm, not dm. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because specific rotation is per decimeter. So I think I did it right.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the formula. Let me double-check. Specific rotation is calculated as:

α = (observed rotation) / (path length × concentration)

But path length is in decimeters, and concentration in g/dl.

So if l is 5 cm, that's 0.5 dm. So 0.5 * 6.15 = 3.075.

So α = (-1.2) / 3.075 ≈ -0.3902.

This is not matching any of the options, which suggests I must have missed something.

Wait, perhaps the problem says that the concentration is 6.15 g per 100 ml, but when placed in the polarimeter tube, the volume used is less, so the concentration might be different. Wait, no, the problem states that the concentration is 6.15 g per 100 ml, which is the same as 6.15 g/dl.

Wait, maybe the formula is the other way around? Like α = α_obs × (l × c). But that would give a much larger number. Let me try that:

α = (-1.2) * (0.5 *6.15) = (-1.2)*(3.075)≈-3.69. Still not matching the options.

Hmm, maybe I have the formula wrong. Let me check another source. Specific rotation is defined as the rotation caused by a solution of 1 g per 10 cm path length, but wait, no—specific rotation is the rotation caused by a solution of 1 g per 100 ml (i.e., 1 g/dl) in a 1 dm (10 cm) path length. So the formula should be:

α = (α_obs) / (c × l)

Wait, but c is in g/dl, and l in dm. So for part (a):

c =6.15 g/dl, l=0.5 dm.

So:

α = (-1.2) / (6.15 * 0.5) = (-1.2) / (3.075) ≈ -0.3902.

Wait, but that's still not matching. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the setup. Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate using the concentration in g per 100 ml, but that's the same as g/dl.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should look at the options and see which specific rotation fits when I plug in the numbers.

Looking at the options, option H is -40.0, which would be part (a). Let me see:

If α = -40.0, then for part (a), using l=0.5 dm, c=6.15 g/dl, then α_obs = α * l * c = (-40.0) * 0.5 * 6.15.

Wait, 0.5 *6.15 is 3.075. So 40 *3.075 is 123. So α_obs would be -123°, which is way too high compared to the given -1.2°. So that can't be right.

Wait, maybe I'm getting the formula wrong. Oh wait! Wait a minute. Maybe the formula is α_obs = α * l * c, where α is the specific rotation, l is in dm, and c in g/dl. So rearranged, α = α_obs / (l * c).

Wait, that's what I did earlier. So for part (a), α = (-1.2)/(0.5*6.15) = (-1.2)/3.075 ≈ -0.3902. But none of the options' part (a) match that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup.

Wait, perhaps the concentration is 6.15 g per 100 ml, but when placed into the polarimeter tube, the used volume is different, affecting the concentration. No, the problem states that the concentration is 6.15 g per 100 ml, so that's the concentration in the solution, regardless of the volume taken.

Wait, perhaps the specific rotation is in degrees per liter or something else. No, specific rotation is typically in degrees per decimeter per gram per deciliter.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the molar concentration, but I don't think so because the problem gives the concentration in grams, not moles.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is α = (α_obs) / (l × c), but with c in g/ml. Let me try that.

c =6.15 g/100ml = 0.0615 g/ml.

So l=0.5 dm =5 cm, but in the formula, l should be in dm, so 0.5 dm.

So:

α = (-1.2) / (0.5 × 6.15) = (-1.2)/(3.075) ≈-0.3902.

Still the same issue. So perhaps there's a mistake in the problem or in my approach. Alternatively, perhaps the specific rotation is per 100 ml, but that doesn't make sense because specific rotation is per unit concentration and path length.

Wait, maybe I should think that the answer is actually around -39, and perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me try again:

Wait, perhaps I should have used l in cm instead of converting to dm. Because specific rotation is per cm? No, no, I think specific rotation is per dm.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to calculate using the options. For example, let's take option H: part (a) specific rotation is -40.0.

Then, for part (a), α_obs = α * l * c.

So:

α_obs = (-40) * (5 cm) * (6.15 g/100 ml).

Wait, but wait, the units. Let me get the units right. Because specific rotation is (°)/(dm × g/dl), so l must be in dm, and c in g/dl.

So 5 cm = 0.5 dm. c=6.15 g/dl.

So α_obs = (-40) * (0.5) * (6.15) = (-40) *3.075 = -123°. But the observed rotation is given as -1.2°, which is way off. So option H can't be correct.

Wait, but the observed rotation is -1.2°, which is much smaller. So perhaps the specific rotation is much higher. Let me try option C: part (a) is -42.0.

α_obs = (-42) *0.5 *6.15= (-42)*3.075≈-129.15, which is way higher than -1.2. So that's not matching.

Wait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think of the formula differently. Maybe α_obs = α × l × c, so α = α_obs / (l × c). So if α_obs is -1.2, l=0.5 dm, c=6.15 g/dl, then:

α = (-1.2) / (0.5 ×6.15) = (-1.2)/(3.075) ≈ -0.3902 degrees.

But this doesn't match any of the options, which suggests I must have made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, perhaps the concentration in the formula is in g per liter. Wait, 6.15 g per 100 ml is 61.5 g per liter. So c=61.5 g/l.

But then, if I use c in g per liter, the formula would be different. Let me try that.

Wait, specific rotation is per g per deciliter, so perhaps I shouldn't use g per liter. Hmm, perhaps I should convert the concentration to g per liter.

Wait, 6.15 g per 100 ml is 61.5 g per liter. So c=61.5 g/l.

But when using the formula α = α_obs/(l*c), with l in dm and c in g/dl, I think I need to adjust the concentration.

Wait, 61.5 g/l is 6.15 g/dl, because 1 liter is 10 deciliters. So 61.5 g/l = 6.15 g/dl. So that's the same as before. So the calculation remains the same.

I'm stuck. Maybe I should try to compute the specific rotation again.

Wait, perhaps the formula is α = (α_obs) × (l × c), but that would make it even worse. Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate using the molar concentration, but I don't have the molar mass of cholesterol provided.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation. Let me compute 0.5 *6.15 again. 0.5 times 6.15 is indeed 3.075.

So α = (-1.2) /3.075 ≈ -0.3902.

But the options don't have anything close to -0.39. So perhaps part (a) is -39.0, which would be option I or A.

Wait, let's see option I: part (a) is -39.0.

Then, using α = (-39.0) * (0.5) *6.15.

= (-39)*(3.075) = (-39)*3 = -117, (-39)*0.075= -2.925, total ≈-119.925, which is way more than the given -1.2.

So that can't be right. Maybe I'm missing a factor of 1000 somewhere. Wait, perhaps the concentration is in g per liter, so 6150 mg per 100 ml. No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the formula is α = (α_obs) / (l × c), but l is in cm, not dm. Let me try that.

So l =5 cm, c=6.15 g/100 ml =6.15 g/dl.

So:

α = (-1.2) / (5 *6.15) = (-1.2)/(30.75) ≈-0.03902 degrees. That's even worse.

Hmm. I'm not getting anywhere. Maybe I should approach part (b) or (c) and see if that gives me any clues.

Part (b): same solution in a 10-cm tube. So l=10 cm =1 dm. The concentration is the same, 6.15 g/dl. So observed rotation would be α × l × c.

But wait, from part (a), if part (a)'s specific rotation is α, then part (b)'s observed rotation would be α × 10 cm ×6.15 g/dl.

Wait, but I don't know α yet. Alternatively, perhaps I can relate the rotations.

Wait, the observed rotation is directly proportional to the path length. Because if concentration and specific rotation are the same, doubling the path length would double the observed rotation.

So if part (a) is -1.2° with l=5 cm, then part (b) with l=10 cm would be -2.4°, because the path length doubles.

Looking at the options, part (b) options are -2.4 (option A), -2.2 (B), -2.4 (H), etc. So part (b) would be -2.4 if part (a) is -1.2. But that's assuming that the specific rotation and concentration are the same.

Wait, but if the specific rotation is α, then α_obs = α × l × c.

So for part (a), α_obs1 = α × l1 × c.

For part (b), α_obs2 = α × l2 × c.

So α_obs2 = (α × l2 × c) = (α × l1 × c ) × (l2/l1) ) = α_obs1 × (l2/l1).

So if l2 is 10 cm and l1 is 5 cm, then α_obs2 = (-1.2) × (10/5) = -2.4°.

So part (b)'s observed rotation is -2.4°, which matches part (b) in option A and H.

Now, part (c) is: 10 ml diluted to 20 ml in a 5-cm tube. So the concentration is halved because you're doubling the volume. So new concentration is 6.15 g/100ml × (10/20) = 3.075 g/100ml = 3.075 g/dl.

So observed rotation would be α × l × c_new.

Again, using α from part (a), which we thought was -0.3902, but that seems too low. Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of the same α.

Wait, but the initial approach is taking too long, and I'm not making progress. Let me try to think differently.

Wait, perhaps the specific rotation is -39.0, and part (a)'s observed rotation is -1.2°, which would imply:

α = -39.0.

Then, for part (a):

α_obs = α × l × c.

So -1.2 = (-39.0) × 0.5 × 6.15.

Calculate the right side: 0.5 ×6.15=3.075; 39 ×3.075=120. So 39 ×3.075=120. So (-39)*3.075= -120. But the observed is -1.2, which is way off. So that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I should try the specific rotation from option H: -40.0.

So α = -40.0.

Then, α_obs = (-40) ×0.5×6.15= (-40)*3.075= -123. Which is way higher than -1.2.

Hmm, not matching.

Wait, perhaps I should instead consider that the observed rotation is proportional to the concentration and the path length. So for part (c), the concentration is halved, so the observed rotation would be half of what it would be without dilution.

Wait, but without knowing the specific rotation, I can't directly compute. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the same approach as part (b), but with the new concentration.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the specific rotation correctly, and then proceed.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation. Let me try again.

Given:

α_obs (a) = -1.2°,

l =5 cm=0.5 dm,

c=6.15 g/dl.

So specific rotation α = (-1.2) / (0.5 ×6.15) = (-1.2)/(3.075) ≈-0.3902.

But that's about -0.39°, which doesn't match any options. So perhaps I'm using the wrong formula.

Wait, perhaps the specific rotation formula is:

α = (α_obs) / (l × c),

where l is in cm, not dm. So l=5 cm.

c=6.15 g/100ml =6.15 g/dl.

So:

α = (-1.2) / (5 ×6.15) = (-1.2)/(30.75)≈-0.03902.

That's even worse. So I'm not getting it right.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the concentration is 6.15 g per 100 ml, which is 61.5 g per liter, and the formula should use concentration in g per liter.

So c=61.5 g/l.

Then, α = (-1.2) / (0.5 dm × (61.5 g/l)).

Wait, but specific rotation is usually in g/dl, so 61.5 g/l =6.15 g/dl.

So I think I'm back to the same issue.

Wait, perhaps I should accept that I'm missing something and look for another approach.

Let me consider that perhaps the specific rotation is -39.0, as in option A.

Then, for part (a):

α_obs = α × l × c.

So:

-1.2 = (-39.0) × 0.5 ×6.15.

Calculating the right side: 0.5 ×6.15=3.075; 39 ×3.075=121.95. So 39 ×3.075=121.95, so -39 ×3.075= -121.95. But the observed is -1.2, which is way off. So that can't be.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of milligrams. Let me try that.

Wait, the concentration is 6.15 g per 100 ml, which is 6150 mg per 100 ml, so 61.5 mg/ml.

But I don't think that helps because the formula uses grams, not milligrams.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is α = (α_obs) × (l × c), but that would make the specific rotation even larger, which doesn't help.

Wait, perhaps the problem has a typo, and the observed rotation is -12°, which would make more sense. But the given is -1.2°, so I have to work with that.

Wait, maybe I should give up and look for another approach. Let me think about part (c).

Part (c): 10 ml diluted to 20 ml. So the concentration becomes half: 6.15 g/100ml → 3.075 g/100ml.

Placed in a 5-cm tube (l=0.5 dm).

The observed rotation would be α × l × c_new.

If I know α from part (a), I can compute it.

Wait, but from part (a), I can't get α because I'm getting a value that doesn't match the options. Alternatively, perhaps I can express part (c)'s observed rotation in terms of part (a)'s.

From part (a):

α_obs_a = α × l_a × c_a.

In part (c):

α_obs_c = α × l_c × c_c.

But l_c is 5 cm=0.5 dm, same as part (a). c_c is 3.075 g/dl (half of c_a).

So α_obs_c = α × 0.5 ×3.075 = (α ×0.5 ×6.15)/2 = (α ×3.075)/2.

But from part (a), α ×3.075= -1.2°.

So α_obs_c = (-1.2)/2 = -0.6°.

So part (c)'s observed rotation is -0.6°, which matches the first option A, third part (-0.6), and option H's third part is -0.5.

Wait, so if part (c) is -0.6°, then looking at the options, option A has part (c) as -0.6, part (b) as -2.4, and part (a) as -39.0. But from part (a), I calculated α as -0.39, but if the specific rotation is -39, then part (a)'s observed rotation would be way higher than given.

Wait, perhaps I should accept that part (c) is -0.6, which is option A's third part, and part (b) is -2.4, which is option A's second part. So for option A, the parts are (a) -39.0, (b)-2.4, (c)-0.6.

But then, if the specific rotation is -39.0, part (a)'s observed rotation would be:

α_obs = (-39) ×0.5 ×6.15 = (-39)*3.075 ≈-120°, which is way higher than the given -1.2°. So that can't be.

Hmm, this is confusing. Maybe I should try to find the specific rotation correctly.

Wait, perhaps I should write the formula as:

α (specific) = (α_obs) / (l × c),

where:

- α_obs is in degrees,
- l is in dm,
- c is in g/dl.

Given:

α_obs = -1.2°,

l =5 cm=0.5 dm,

c=6.15 g/dl.

So:

α = (-1.2) / (0.5 ×6.15) = (-1.2)/3.075 ≈-0.3902.

But none of the options have part (a) as -0.39. So perhaps the answer is option F, which has part (a) as -38.0, but I don't know.

Wait, perhaps I should think that the concentration is 61.5 g per liter, which is 6.15 g per deciliter. So that's correct.

Wait, maybe I should use the reciprocal. Let me try:

If I have α_obs = (specific rotation) × (path length) × (concentration),

then to find specific rotation, it's α = α_obs / (path length × concentration).

So plugging the numbers:

α = (-1.2) / (0.5 *6.15) = (-1.2)/3.075 ≈-0.3902.

But that's still the same result. So perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but that can't be.

Wait, perhaps I'm supposed to ignore the units and just calculate based on the given numbers. Let me try that.

If I ignore the units and just calculate:

α = (-1.2) / (5 *6.15) = (-1.2)/30.75 ≈-0.039.

But that's even worse.

Wait, maybe I should consider that the concentration is 6.15 g per liter, not per deciliter. So c=6.15 g/L = 0.615 g/dl.

Then:

α = (-1.2) / (0.5 *0.615) = (-1.2)/(0.3075) ≈-3.902.

That's about -3.9°, which is still not matching the options.

Wait, but option E has part (a) as -38.5. Let me see:

If α=-38.5,

then α_obs = (-38.5) *0.5 *6.15 = (-38.5)*3.075≈-118.2375°, which is way higher than -1.2.

So that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps the formula is α = (α_obs) × (l × c), which would make the specific rotation much larger.

But then, for part (a):

α = (-1.2) ×0.5 ×6.15= (-1.2)*3.075≈-3.69. Still not matching.

I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the specific rotation is given as the observed rotation divided by the product of path length and concentration. So:

α = α_obs / (l × c),

where l is in cm, and c is in g/100ml.

So let's try that.

l =5 cm,

c=6.15 g/100ml.

So:

α = (-1.2) / (5 *6.15) = (-1.2)/(30.75) ≈-0.03902.

Again, not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps the specific rotation is in degrees per liter. So c=6.15 g/100ml =61.5 g/L.

Then:

α = (-1.2) / (5 *61.5) = (-1.2)/(307.5) ≈-0.003902, which is way too small.

I'm not getting anywhere. Perhaps I should consider that the answer is option H: -40.0, -2.4, -0.5.

Because part (b) is -2.4 (which is -1.2 ×2), and part (c) is -0.6, but option H's part (c) is -0.5.

Wait, but part (c) would be (1/2) of part (a)'s concentration, so observed rotation would be half of part (a)'s if the path length is the same.

If part (a) is -1.2°, then part (c) would be (-1.2)/2 = -0.6°, which matches option A's part (c). But option H's part (c) is -0.5, which doesn't match.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option H: -40.0, -2.4, -0.5.

Because part (b) is -2.4, which is double part (a)'s -1.2, and part (c) is -0.5, which would be part (a) divided by 4 (if concentration is halved and path length is same, then observed rotation is halved, but part (c) is -0.6 if it's half, but option H has -0.5. So perhaps I made a mistake in part (c).

Wait, in part (c), you take 10 ml of the original solution (6.15 g/100ml) and dilute to 20 ml, making the concentration 3.075 g/100ml.

Then, in a 5-cm tube (0.5 dm), the observed rotation would be:

α_obs_c = α ×0.5 ×3.075.

If α is -40.0,

α_obs_c = (-40) ×0.5 ×3.075 = (-40)*1.5375= -61.5°, which is way off.

But according to the problem, the observed rotation in part (c) is much smaller than part (a). So perhaps the correct answer is option A: -39.0, -2.4, -0.6.

Because part (c) would be -0.6, which is half of -1.2, which would make sense if the concentration is halved. But earlier calculation with α=-39 gives part (a)'s observed rotation as -120°, which is way higher than given.

I'm really stuck here. Maybe I should just pick the option where part (b) is -2.4 and part (c) is -0.6, which is option A.

So the answer would be option A: -39.0, -2.4, -0.6.

To solve the problem, we calculate the specific rotation and predict the observed rotations based on the given conditions. 

### Part (a): Specific Rotation
The formula for specific rotation is:

\[
\alpha = \frac{\alpha_{\text{obs}}}{l \cdot c}
\]

Where:
- \(\alpha_{\text{obs}} = -1.2^\circ\),
- \(l = 5 \, \text{cm} = 0.5 \, \text{dm}\),
- \(c = 6.15 \, \text{g/100 mL} = 6.15 \, \text{g/dL}\).

Substituting the values:

\[
\alpha = \frac{-1.2}{0.5 \cdot 6.15} = \frac{-1.2}{3.075} \approx -0.390^\circ
\]

This result does not match any of the provided options for part (a), suggesting a potential issue with the interpretation of the formula or units.

### Part (b): Observed Rotation in a 10-cm Tube
The observed rotation is directly proportional to the path length. If the path length doubles, the observed rotation also doubles. Thus:

\[
\alpha_{\text{obs,new}} = -1.2^\circ \cdot \frac{10}{5} = -2.4^\circ
\]

This matches the second value in **Option A** and **Option H**.

### Part (c): Dilution to 20 mL in a 5-cm Tube
When 10 mL of the solution is diluted to 20 mL, the concentration is halved. The new concentration is:

\[
c_{\text{new}} = \frac{6.15 \, \text{g/100 mL}}{2} = 3.075 \, \text{g/100 mL}
\]

The observed rotation is proportional to the concentration. Thus:

\[
\alpha_{\text{obs,new}} = -1.2^\circ \cdot \frac{3.075}{6.15} = -0.6^\circ
\]

This matches the third value in **Option A**.

### Conclusion
Based on the calculations for parts (b) and (c), the correct answer is:

**Option A: -39.0, -2.4, -0.6**
