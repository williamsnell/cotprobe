Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics problem about a clown juggling four balls. Hmm, let's see. The question says the clown takes 0.9 seconds to cycle each ball through his hands, including catching, transferring, and throwing. I need to find the minimum vertical speed he must throw each ball. The options are given from A to J.

Wait, juggling four balls... I remember that in juggling, each ball follows a parabolic trajectory, spending time going up and coming back down. Since there are four balls, they must be thrown in such a way that they don't interfere with each other. So, each ball is thrown one after another, but their flight times must overlap so that the clown can catch and throw them in a cycle.

The time given, 0.9 seconds, I think refers to the time each ball spends in the air until it's caught again. Or maybe it's the time between throws? Hmm, the question says it's the time to cycle each ball through his hands, including catching, transferring, and throwing, to be ready for the next catch. So probably, each ball is thrown, and the total time from when it's thrown until it's caught again is 0.9 seconds.

Wait, no, actually, if it's juggling four balls, each ball is thrown, and the time between when one ball is thrown and the next is thrown might be the cycle time. Because in juggling, each throw happens at equal intervals. So with four balls, each throw happens every 0.9 seconds. So each ball is in the air for a time that allows it to return just as the next one is thrown. Therefore, the time each ball spends in the air is 0.9 seconds.

Wait, but if the cycle time is 0.9 seconds, then each ball must be in the air for a time that's a multiple of that, but perhaps each throw happens every 0.9 seconds. So each ball, when thrown, must stay in the air for enough time so that when the clown is ready to catch the next one, it comes down. So maybe each ball's flight time is 0.9 seconds? Or perhaps the time each ball is in the air is 0.9 seconds, but considering they're thrown at different times.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The total time for each ball to go up and come back down is the time it's in the air. The problem states that the clown cycles each ball through his hands in 0.9 seconds. So perhaps each ball spends 0.9 seconds in the air. Because if he's juggling four balls, each one is thrown, and during the time it's in the air, he throws the next one, and so on. So the flight time of each ball must be 0.9 seconds.

So the time for each throw is 0.9 seconds. So I can model the vertical motion of the ball. The ball is thrown upwards with some initial velocity, v, reaches the peak, then falls back down. The total time for the ball to go up and come back down is 0.9 seconds.

I remember that the time to reach the peak is (v)/g, where g is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.8 m/s²). Then the time to come back down is the same, so total time is 2*(v/g). Wait, but that's if the ball is caught at the same height it was thrown from. But in juggling, the balls are usually caught and thrown at the same height, perhaps chest level.

So if the total time is 0.9 seconds, then 2*(v/g) = 0.9. So solving for v: v = (0.9/2)*g = 0.45 * 9.8 = let's calculate that.

0.45 *9.8 is 4.41 m/s. Wait, that's much lower than any of the options. So maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, perhaps the 0.9 seconds is the time between throws, not the time each ball is in the air. Because with four balls, each ball is thrown every 0.9 seconds. So the time each ball is in the air would be a bit longer than that. Because each ball is thrown, and the next one is thrown after 0.9 seconds, but the flight time of each ball must allow the clown to catch it before the next throw.

Wait, let's think about the number of throws. In a four-ball juggling cascade, each ball is thrown, and the time between throws is T. So each ball is in the air for time T, but that's not correct because the first ball is thrown, then after T, the second, and so on. So each ball is in the air for a time that's the same as the cycle time T. So if the cycle time is 0.9 seconds, each ball is in the air for 0.9 seconds.

But earlier, my calculation gave a speed of 4.41 m/s, which is way lower than the options. So that must mean I'm wrong.

Wait, maybe I got the time wrong. Let me think again. Suppose the time each ball is in the air is longer than the cycle time. Because each time a ball is thrown, the previous one is still in the air. So the time between throws is T, and each ball is in the air for a time of n*T, where n is the number of throws. Wait, perhaps for four balls, each is in the air for 3.6 seconds? No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps for a four-ball juggling pattern, each ball is thrown every T seconds, and the time each ball is in the air is the same as T, but that can't be because four balls are in the air at the same time, each thrown at intervals. Hmm, maybe I should approach it differently.

Alternatively, perhaps the time each ball spends in the air is equal to the cycle time (0.9 s). So each ball is thrown and caught after 0.9 seconds. So the total flight time for each ball is 0.9 seconds.

But then, using the equation for vertical motion, the time to go up and come back down is t = 2*v/g, where v is the initial velocity. So 2v/g = 0.9 → v = (0.9/2)*g = 0.45*9.8 ≈ 4.41 m/s. But this is not matching any of the options. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the 0.9 seconds is the total time for the entire cycle, including all the balls. For four balls, each ball is in the air for a time longer than 0.9 seconds. Let's think: in a four-ball juggling pattern, each ball is thrown, and then after some time, it's caught, then thrown again. The time between each throw is T, which is the cycle time. For four balls, the number of balls is four, so the time each ball is in the air is 3*T. Because the first ball is thrown at time 0, the next at T, the next at 2T, and the next at 3T. So the first ball is caught at 4T, the second at 5T, etc. Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, the time each ball is in the air is (n-1)*T, where n is the number of balls. For four balls, each ball is in the air for 3*T. So if T is 0.9 s, then each ball is in the air for 3*0.9 = 2.7 seconds. That makes more sense because 2.7 seconds is longer than the options suggest.

Wait, but let me think again: in a four-ball cascade, each ball is thrown, then the next after T, then the next after 2T, and so on. So the first ball is thrown at time 0, caught at time t1. Then the next is thrown at T, caught at T + t1, etc. So the total time for the pattern to repeat is 4*T, but each ball is in the air for 3*T. Because when you have four balls, each one is thrown every T seconds, and the time between a throw and the next is T. So the first ball is thrown at 0, caught at 3T. Then thrown again at 4T, caught at 7T, etc. So each flight time is 3T.

So if the cycle time is T=0.9 s, then each ball is in the air for 3*0.9 = 2.7 seconds. So the time the ball is in the air is 2.7 seconds.

Now, using the vertical motion equation, the time to reach the peak and come back is 2.7 seconds. So t = 2v/g → v = (t/2)*g = (2.7/2)*9.8.

Let me calculate that: 2.7 divided by 2 is 1.35. 1.35 * 9.8 = approximately 13.23 m/s.

Looking at the options, option E is 13.2 m/s, which is very close. So that should be the answer.

Wait, let me double-check the reasoning. If each ball is in the air for 2.7 seconds, then the vertical motion is symmetric. So the initial velocity must be such that the time up and down is 2.7 s. So yes, 2v/g = 2.7 → v = (2.7/2)*g = 13.23 m/s, which rounds to 13.2 m/s, option E.

The problem involves a clown juggling four balls, with each ball cycling through the clown's hands in 0.9 seconds. To find the minimum vertical speed required, we analyze the vertical motion of the balls. In a four-ball juggling pattern, each ball is in the air for a time of \( t = 3 \times T \), where \( T = 0.9 \, \mathrm{s} \). Thus, \( t = 3 \times 0.9 = 2.7 \, \mathrm{s} \).

The total time a ball is in the air (ascending and descending) is \( t = 2.7 \, \mathrm{s} \). Using the kinematic equation for vertical motion, the time to reach the peak is \( t_{\text{up}} = \frac{v}{g} \), where \( g = 9.8 \, \mathrm{m/s^2} \). The total time in the air is \( t = 2 \times t_{\text{up}} = 2 \times \frac{v}{g} \). Solving for \( v \), we get:

\[
v = \frac{t \cdot g}{2} = \frac{2.7 \times 9.8}{2} = 13.23 \, \mathrm{m/s}.
\]

Rounding to two decimal places, \( v \approx 13.2 \, \mathrm{m/s} \), which corresponds to option E.
