Okay, so I have this question about how many female renouncers were under the tutelage of Chandanbala. The options are A through J, with various numbers. I'm not too familiar with this topic, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I need to figure out who Chandanbala is. I think he's a significant figure in the context of renunciation or maybe a religious or spiritual leader. Renouncers usually refer to people who have given up materialistic life, perhaps monks or nuns in some traditions. Female renouncers would then be nuns or women following a similar path.

I remember reading somewhere that in some religious orders, the number of renouncers can be quite large, especially if it's a well-known or influential leader. Chandanbala might be a teacher or guru who has a large following. So the numbers here are all in the thousands, which suggests a sizable following.

Looking at the options: A is 36,000, B is 7,000, C is 24,000, D is 50,000, E is 28,000, F is 18,000, G is 42,000, H is 15,000, I is 12,000, and J is 30,000. These are all pretty big numbers, but I'm not sure which is correct.

I think in some contexts, like certain Hindu or Buddhist traditions, the number of followers can be quite large. Maybe Chandanbala led a particularly successful movement. I'm trying to recall if I've heard any specific numbers associated with him. If I can't remember, perhaps I can think of similar figures. For example, some gurus have a few thousand followers, but others might have tens of thousands.

Wait, I think I've heard that the number might be around 24,000. That's one of the options, option C. Alternatively, 30,000 is option J. I'm not entirely certain, but 24,000 sounds familiar. Maybe it's a commonly cited number in some sources.

Another angle: sometimes these numbers are symbolic or based on some calculation. For instance, in some religious contexts, numbers like 12,000 or 24,000 are significant, perhaps representing a large but manageable community. 24,000 seems plausible as a number that could be under a single tutor's care.

Alternatively, maybe I'm confusing this with another figure. I'm not 100% sure, but based on what I think I've heard before, I'm leaning towards 24,000 as the answer.
