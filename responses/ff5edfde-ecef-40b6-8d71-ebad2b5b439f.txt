Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a concave mirror. Let me try to figure this out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on optics, but I'll give it a shot.

Alright, the problem says that an individual wants to look at his face in an ordinary hand magnifying mirror, which is a concave mirror. The distance from his face to the mirror is 20 cm. He wants the image to be 40 cm from the mirror. So, I need to find the radius of curvature, focal length, and the magnification.

Hmm, I remember that concave mirrors have some specific formulas. The mirror equation is 1/f = 1/do + 1/di, where f is the focal length, do is the object distance, and di is the image distance. Also, magnification m is given by m = -di/do.

Wait, but wait! Wait, in the mirror equation, the signs depend on whether it's a real or virtual image. Since this is a concave mirror, and the object is placed within the focal length (I think), the image would be virtual and upright. So, in that case, the image distance di would be positive or negative? I think in the standard sign conventions, for mirrors, if the image is virtual, di is considered negative. Wait, no, let me get this right.

Wait, no, in the mirror equation, the object distance do is always positive because it's on the same side as the incoming light. For a concave mirror, when the object is inside the focal length, the image is virtual and on the same side as the object, so di would be negative because the image is behind the mirror.

Wait, but the problem says the image is 40 cm from the mirror. So, if the mirror is 20 cm from the face, the image is 40 cm from the mirror. So, the total distance from the object to the image would be 20 cm (object to mirror) plus 40 cm (image from mirror) but in the same direction? Or is it that the image is on the same side as the object.

Wait, let me think. The mirror is placed 20 cm from the face. The image is 40 cm from the mirror on the same side as the face because it's a virtual image. So, the image is behind the mirror, 40 cm away. So, the object distance do is +20 cm, and the image distance di is -40 cm because it's on the same side as the object. Wait, no, wait, actually, in the standard convention, for concave mirrors, when the object is within f, the image is virtual and upright, so the image distance di is negative.

Wait, wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me clarify the sign conventions. I think the standard rule is:

- For mirrors, the object distance (do) is positive if the object is in front of the mirror (real object), which it always is. So do is positive.

- The image distance (di) is positive if the image is real and formed in front of the mirror, and negative if it's virtual and formed behind the mirror.

So in this case, the image is 40 cm behind the mirror, so di would be -40 cm.

Wait, no, wait, the image is 40 cm from the mirror, but on which side? Since the mirror is concave, and the object is within the focal length, the image is virtual and on the same side as the object. So, the mirror is 20 cm from the face, and the image is 40 cm from the mirror on the same side. So, the image is 20 cm + 40 cm = 60 cm from the face? Wait, no, the distance from the mirror is 40 cm. So, the image is 40 cm behind the mirror, so di is -40 cm.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me confirm. If the image is on the same side as the object, then di is negative. So, di = -40 cm.

Wait, but the problem states that the image is 40 cm from the mirror. So, the image's position is 40 cm behind the mirror, hence di = -40 cm.

So, using the mirror equation: 1/f = 1/do + 1/di.

Given that do = 20 cm, di = -40 cm.

Plugging in: 1/f = 1/20 + 1/(-40) = (4 - 1)/40 = 3/40.

So, f = 40/3 ≈ 13.33 cm.

Wait, but that would give f as 13.33 cm. But wait, let me check the calculation again.

Wait, 1/20 is 0.05, and 1/-40 is -0.025. So, 0.05 - 0.025 = 0.025. So, 1/f = 0.025 → f = 40 cm.

Wait, wait, that's different. Let me do it properly:

1/20 is 0.05.

1/(-40) is -0.025.

Adding them: 0.05 + (-0.025) = 0.025.

So, 1/f = 0.025 → f = 1/0.025 = 40 cm.

Ah, so f is 40 cm. So the focal length is 40 cm. Then, the radius of curvature R is 2f, so R = 80 cm.

Wait, because R = 2f for mirrors. So R is 80 cm, f is 40 cm.

Now, magnification m is given by m = -di/do.

Here, di is -40 cm, do is +20 cm.

So m = -(-40)/20 = 40/20 = 2.

So magnification is 2.

Wait, but in the options, let's see which one matches R=80 cm, f=40 cm, m=2.

Looking at the options:

Option D: R=80, f=40, m=3 → No.

Option H: R=80, f=40, m=2 → Yes.

Option B: R=80, f=20, m=2 → No, because f should be 40.

Wait, no, wait, let me check the options again.

Looking back:

Option B: Radius 80, f 20, m 2 → No, because we have f=40.

Option D: R=80, f=40, m=3 → No, because m is 2.

Option H: R=80, f=40, m=2 → Yes, that's correct.

Wait, so the correct answer should be option H.

But wait, I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought di was -40, but let me confirm the sign conventions again.

Wait, in the mirror equation, if the image is virtual and on the same side as the object (behind the mirror), di is negative. So, when we plug in di = -40 cm.

So, mirror equation:

1/f = 1/do + 1/di → 1/f = (1/20) + (1/-40) → (2 -1)/40 → 1/40 → f=40 cm.

Yes, that's correct.

So, R=80 cm, f=40 cm, m=2.

So, the correct option is H.
</think>

The problem involves a concave mirror where the object distance (do) is 20 cm, and the image distance (di) is 40 cm behind the mirror, making di = -40 cm. Using the mirror equation \( \frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{do} + \frac{1}{di} \), we calculate \( \frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{20} + \frac{1}{-40} = 0.025 \), giving \( f = 40 \, \text{cm} \). The radius of curvature \( R = 2f = 80 \, \text{cm} \). Magnification is \( m = -\frac{di}{do} = -\frac{-40}{20} = 2 \). The correct option is H: \( R = 80 \, \text{cm}, f = 40 \, \text{cm}, m = 2 \).

Answer: H
