Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the answer to this question about the relationship between the formal sources of international law. The question is asking about how these sources relate to each other in terms of hierarchy or precedence. The options are A through J, so I need to go through each one carefully.

First, I remember that international law has several formal sources, as outlined in Article 38 of the Statute of the International Court of Justice. These sources include treaties, customary international law, general principles of law, and the teachings of publicists and judicial decisions as non-binding but influential factors.

So the question is about the hierarchy among these. Let me think about each option:

Option A: Treaties supersede custom. Wait, but I think customary law is considered the second most important after treaties. So if a treaty exists, it usually takes precedence over custom. But is that always the case? I'm not entirely sure, but I think this might be correct.

Option B: Treaties and General Principles are equal and both supersede custom. Hmm, I'm not sure if they're equal. Treaties are specific agreements, while general principles are more like foundational concepts. I don't think they are of equal importance, so this might not be right.

Option C: General Principles supersede both custom and treaties. No, I don't think that's correct. Treaties are primary sources when they exist, and general principles are more like a backup, maybe. So this seems unlikely.

Option D: Judicial decisions and teachings are the only sources. No, because Article 38 mentions them as 'subsidiaryâ€™ sources. So D is wrong because it's not saying they are the only sources, just part of the formal ones.

Option E: Those same sources (judicial and teachings) supersede custom and treaties. That doesn't make sense because they are considered subsidiary, not superior. So E is incorrect.

Option F: Custom and General Principles are equal and both supersede treaties. No, because treaties are primary. So F is wrong.

Option G: There's a hierarchy, but it varies. I think the hierarchy is generally accepted, so G might be referring to situations where it's not fixed. Maybe in some cases, but I'm not sure if that's the standard view.

Option H: Custom supersedes treaties. No, because treaties are specific and binding, so they usually take precedence over custom. So H is incorrect.

Option I: Treaties and custom are equal, but General Principles supersede both. No, because treaties are primary, and general principles are more like a residual category. So I don't think this is right.

Option J: No hierarchy between sources. That can't be right because I know there's a hierarchy: treaties first, then custom, then general principles, etc.

Wait, going back to Option A: Treaties supersede custom. That seems correct because when a treaty exists on a matter, it typically takes precedence over customary law. So A might be the answer. But wait, I should double-check.

Another thought: In some cases, if a treaty is considered peremptory (jus cogens), it might not be superseded, but generally, I think when a treaty exists, it overrides custom. So A could be correct. Alternatively, in some cases, the hierarchy could be more nuanced, but the default is that treaties take precedence.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused about whether general principles are above or below custom. I think general principles are more like third tier, after treaties and custom. So the hierarchy is Treaties > Custom > General Principles.

So looking back at the options, which one fits that? Option A says Treaties supersede custom, which is correct, but what about the other sources? The question is about the relationship between the formal sources, so it's not just about treaties and custom. But the options don't all cover all sources.

Wait, the question is about the relationship between the formal sources, so it's about their hierarchy. The main formal sources are treaties, custom, and general principles. So the hierarchy is Treaties > Custom > General Principles. So which option reflects that?

Looking at the options, none of them mention all three except perhaps Option A, which only talks about treaties and custom.

Wait, the options are a bit tricky. Let me read them again.

Option A: Treaties supersede custom. So that's correct for those two.

Option B: Treaties and General Principles are equal and supersede custom. No, because Treaties are higher than both.

Option I: Treaties and custom are equal, but General Principles supersede both. No, that's not correct.

Wait, maybe the correct answer is that there's a hierarchy, but it's not always fixed. No, that's not right because the hierarchy is established.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is that treaties are primary, then custom, then general principles. So the hierarchy is clear, but looking at the options, the best fit is Option A, which says Treaties supersede custom, but what about the other sources?

Wait, perhaps the answer is that there is a hierarchy, with Treaties first, then Custom, then General Principles. So the correct option would be A because it correctly states that Treaties supersede Custom. But I'm not sure if the question is considering all sources or just two.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is that there is a hierarchy, but it's not mentioned in the options as such. Let me check the options again.

Option G says there is a hierarchy, but it varies from case to case. But I think the hierarchy is generally fixed, so G might not be correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is that Treaties and Custom are the primary sources, with Treaties taking precedence. So Option A is correct.

Wait, but I'm a bit uncertain because sometimes the hierarchy can depend on the context, but generally, it's established. So I think the answer is A: Treaties supersede custom.

The question concerns the hierarchy of the formal sources of international law, specifically focusing on how treaties, custom, and general principles of law relate to each other. According to Article 38 of the Statute of the International Court of Justice, the primary sources of international law are treaties, customary international law, and general principles of law. Treaties are considered the highest authority when they exist on a particular matter, followed by customary law, and then general principles. Judicial decisions and the teachings of publicists are subsidiary sources and do not supersede the primary sources.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A** states that treaties supersede custom, which aligns with the established hierarchy where treaties take precedence over custom.
- **Option B** suggests that treaties and general principles are of equal importance and both supersede custom, which is incorrect because treaties are superior to general principles.
- **Option C** claims that general principles supersede both custom and treaties, which is not accurate as treaties are primary sources.
- **Option D** and **E** focus on judicial decisions and teachings of publicists, which are subsidiary and do not supersede treaties or custom.
- **Option F** and **H** incorrectly suggest that custom is superior to treaties or that custom and general principles are equal, which contradicts the hierarchy.
- **Option I** incorrectly states that treaties and custom are equal, with general principles superseding both.
- **Option J** denies any hierarchy, which is incorrect as a clear hierarchy exists.
- **Option G** suggests the hierarchy varies, but the hierarchy is generally fixed, making this option less likely.

The most accurate answer is **Option A**, as treaties are recognized as the highest authority, superseding custom.
