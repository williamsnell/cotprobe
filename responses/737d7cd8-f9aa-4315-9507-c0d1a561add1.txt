Okay, so I have this question about Plato's view on true beauty. I'm a bit rusty on my philosophy, but I remember that Plato had some specific ideas about beauty and forms. Let me try to think this through step by step.

First, I know that Plato was a Greek philosopher who talked a lot about the Theory of Forms. From what I recall, he believed that the physical world we see around us is just a shadow of the real, non-material world of forms or ideas. These forms are perfect and unchanging, and they're what give meaning to things in our everyday experience.

So, applying that to beauty, Plato would probably say that true beauty isn't something we can see or touch in the everyday objects. Instead, it's something more abstract. I think he might have considered that true beauty exists as a form, a perfect ideal that's beyond the imperfections of the material world.

Looking at the options, let's go through them one by one:

A: found in everyday objects. Hmm, but if it's just in everyday things, that doesn't align with the idea of forms being separate and perfect. So probably not A.

B: only found in art. Art can reflect beauty, but I don't think Plato limited it to just art. He was more about the ideal, which could be found in various areas beyond just art. So maybe not B.

C: not of this world. This sounds closer. Since forms are abstract and not physical, true beauty wouldn't be "of this world." That makes sense.

D: found only in human-made objects. No, because Plato's forms are universal, not limited to human creation. So D is not right.

E: only found in the human body. Again, that's too narrow. Beauty for Plato is more about the ideal form, which isn't tied to a specific object like the human body.

F: a materialistic concept only appreciated by the wealthy. That seems off because Plato's ideas were more about abstract concepts, not materialism or wealth.

G: only found in the mind's understanding. That's possible because forms are mental constructs, but I think the question is more about where true beauty exists rather than just in the mind.

H: nonexistent. No, Plato definitely believed in the existence of forms, so H is wrong.

I: everywhere in the natural world. While the natural world can have beautiful aspects, true beauty according to Plato is beyond that, so I don't think it's I.

J: a subjective concept that differs from person to person. Plato's forms are objective, so J is not correct.

So, between C and G. C says "not of this world," which implies it's in another, non-material realm. G says "only found in the mind's understanding." I think Plato would say that true beauty is a form that exists independently, not just in the mind. So C seems more accurate.

The answer is C: not of this world. Plato believed that true beauty exists as an ideal form in a non-material, abstract realm, separate from the imperfections of the physical world.

Answer: C
