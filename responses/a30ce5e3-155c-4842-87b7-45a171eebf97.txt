Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the cyclotron frequency of a charged particle in a magnetic field. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

Alright, the problem says: A nonrelativistic particle with a charge twice that of an electron moves through a uniform magnetic field. The field is π/4 tesla and perpendicular to the velocity. The cyclotron frequency is 1600 Hz. I need to find the particle's mass from the given options.

First, I remember that the cyclotron frequency formula is f = (qB)/(2πm), where f is the frequency, q is the charge, B is the magnetic field strength, and m is the mass of the particle. Oh wait, right, that's the formula. So I can rearrange it to solve for mass m.

Let me write that down: m = (qB)/(2πf). But wait, the charge here isn't just the elementary charge because the particle's charge is twice that of an electron. An electron has charge -e, so this particle's charge is 2e. But since we're dealing with magnitude here, I can just take q = 2e.

E is about 1.602 x 10^-19 coulombs. So q = 2 * 1.602e-19 C = 3.204e-19 C.

The magnetic field B is given as π/4 Tesla. Let me compute that numerically: π is approximately 3.1416, so π/4 is about 0.7854 T.

The frequency f is 1600 Hz.

Now plugging into the formula: m = (3.204e-19 C * 0.7854 T) / (2 * π * 1600 Hz).

Let me compute the numerator first: 3.204e-19 * 0.7854. Let me approximate that. 3.204 * 0.7854 is roughly... 3 * 0.785 is about 2.355, but more accurately: 3.204 * 0.7854 ≈ 2.512e-19? Wait, no, wait: 3.204 * 0.7854 = let's calculate.

3 * 0.7854 = 2.3562. 0.204 * 0.7854 ≈ 0.204 * 0.785 ≈ 0.160. So total ≈ 2.3562 +0.160 = 2.5162. So 2.5162e-19 C·T.

Denominator: 2 * π * 1600. 2*π is about 6.2832. 6.2832 * 1600 = let's see, 6 * 1600=9600, 0.2832*1600≈453.12, so total ≈ 9600 +453.12=10053.12. So denominator is approximately 10053.12.

So m ≈ (2.5162e-19) / 10053.12 ≈ let's compute that. 2.5162e-19 / 1e4 is about 2.5162e-23. But wait, 1e4 is 10,000, and 10053 is about 1.0053e4. So 2.5162e-19 / 1.0053e4 = (2.5162 / 1.0053) * 1e-23. Let's compute 2.5162 / 1.0053 ≈ 2.503 (since 1.0053*2.5 is 2.51325, which is just about 2.5162, so it's roughly 2.5).

So m ≈ 2.5e-23 kg. Wait, but looking at the options, option G is 2.5e-23 kg. But wait, let me double-check my calculations because I might have approximated too much.

Wait, perhaps I should use exact values without approximating as much. Let me recalculate the numerator and denominator more accurately.

Numerator: 2e * (π/4) = 2*(1.602e-19 C) * (π/4 T). Let me compute 2e: 2 *1.602e-19 = 3.204e-19 C. Then multiply by π/4: 3.204e-19 * (π/4) = (3.204 * 3.1416 /4 )e-19. 3.1416/4 is approximately 0.7854. So 3.204 * 0.7854 = let's compute it more accurately.

3 * 0.7854 = 2.3562. 0.204 * 0.7854 = 0.204 * 0.7 is 0.1428, 0.204 * 0.0854 ≈ 0.01745. So total 0.1428 +0.01745 ≈ 0.16025. So total numerator is 2.3562 +0.16025 = 2.51645e-19 C·T.

Denominator: 2 * π * f = 2 * π * 1600. 2 * π is approx 6.28319. 6.28319 *1600 = let's compute: 1600 *6=9600, 1600 * 0.28319 ≈ 1600 *0.28=448 and 1600*0.00319≈5.104, so total ≈448+5.104=453.104. So 9600 +453.104 = 10053.104. So denominator is 10053.104.

So m = (2.51645e-19) / 10053.104. Let's compute 2.51645e-19 /10053.104.

First, 2.51645 /10053.104 ≈ 0.0002503 (since 10053 *0.00025 is 2.51325). So approximately 0.0002503, which is 2.503e-4. But wait, wait no: 10053 is about 1e4, so 2.51645e-19 /1e4 = 2.51645e-23. But wait, no: 2.51645e-19 divided by 1e4 (which is 10,000) is 2.51645e-23, because 1e4 is 10^4, so 1e-19 /1e4 = 1e-23.

Wait, wait, I think I messed up my exponents. Let me correct that.

Wait, 2.51645e-19 divided by 10053.104 is equal to (2.51645 / 10053.104) * 1e-19. So 2.51645 / 10053.104 ≈ 2.51645 / 10053 ≈ approximately 0.0002503. So 0.0002503 * 1e-19 = 2.503e-23 kg.

So the mass is approximately 2.5e-23 kg, which matches option G: 2.5 * 10^-23 kg.

Wait, but looking at the options, option G is 2.5e-23, which is what I got. But wait, I should check if I made any mistake in the formula.

Wait, no: the formula is correct. f = qB/(2πm), so m = qB/(2πf). The charge is 2e, B is π/4, f is 1600 Hz.

Wait, let me compute it more accurately. Let's compute qB/(2πf):

q = 2e = 3.20416e-19 C

B = π/4 ≈ 0.785398 T.

So qB = 3.20416e-19 * 0.785398 ≈ 2.51188e-19 C·T.

Denominator: 2πf = 2 * π * 1600 ≈ 2 *3.1415926535 *1600 ≈6.283185307 *1600 ≈10053.0965.

So m = 2.51188e-19 / 10053.0965 ≈2.51188e-19 /1.00530965e4.

Which is approximately 2.51188e-19 / 1.00530965e4 = (2.51188 /1.00530965) * 1e-23.

2.51188 /1.00530965 ≈2.500 (since 1.0053 *2.5 is about 2.51325, which is close to 2.51188). So it's approximately 2.5e-23 kg.

So the correct answer should be option G: 2.5 *10^-23 kg.

Wait, but looking at the options, option G is 2.5e-23 kg. So yes, that's the one.

To determine the mass of the particle, we use the cyclotron frequency formula:

\[
f = \frac{qB}{2\pi m}
\]

Rearranging for \( m \):

\[
m = \frac{qB}{2\pi f}
\]

Given:
- \( q = 2e = 2 \times 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C} = 3.204 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C} \)
- \( B = \frac{\pi}{4} \, \text{T} \approx 0.7854 \, \text{T} \)
- \( f = 1600 \, \text{Hz} \)

Substituting into the formula:

\[
m = \frac{(3.204 \times 10^{-19}) \times 0.7854}{2\pi \times 1600}
\]

First, calculate the numerator:

\[
3.204 \times 10^{-19} \times 0.7854 \approx 2.516 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C·T}
\]

Next, calculate the denominator:

\[
2\pi \times 1600 \approx 10053.1
\]

Now, compute \( m \):

\[
m = \frac{2.516 \times 10^{-19}}{10053.1} \approx 2.503 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{kg}
\]

This value matches option **G: \( 2.5 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{kg} \)**.
