Question:

A 25-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 2-month history of numbness in her right hand. During this period, she has had tingling in the right ring and small fingers most of the time. She has no history of serious illness and takes no medications. She is employed as a cashier and uses a computer at home. She played as a pitcher in a softball league for 5 years until she stopped 2 years ago. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows full muscle strength. Palpation of the right elbow produces a jolt of severe pain in the right ring and small fingers. Sensation to pinprick and light touch is decreased over the medial half of the right ring finger and the entire small finger. The most likely cause of these findings is entrapment of which of the following on the right?

Options:

A: Median nerve at the forearm
B: Radial nerve at the forearm
C: Ulnar nerve at the elbow
D: Median nerve at the elbow
E: Radial nerve at the wrist
F: Musculocutaneous nerve at the forearm
G: Radial nerve at the elbow
H: Ulnar nerve at the wrist
I: Median nerve at the wrist
J: Musculocutaneous nerve at the wrist

Answer:

Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. So, the patient is a 25-year-old woman with a 2-month history of numbness in her right hand. She's experiencing tingling in her right ring and small fingers most of the time. Her job involves being a cashier and using a computer at home. She used to play softball as a pitcher but stopped two years ago. Vital signs are normal, and the exam shows full muscle strength. 

So, the key findings here are the numbness and tingling in the ring and small fingers. Also, when her right elbow is palpated, she experiences severe pain in those same fingers. The decreased sensation is over the medial half of the ring finger and the entire small finger. 

I remember that the ulnar nerve is responsible for sensation in the little and ring fingers, especially the medial aspects. The ulnar nerve runs along the medial side of the elbow, specifically behind the medial epicondyle. That's why hitting the "funny bone" causes a shock in the little and ring fingers. 

When the elbow is palpated and causes pain in those fingers, it suggests that the nerve is being compressed or irritated at the elbow. So, entrapment of the ulnar nerve at the elbow (which is also known as cubital tunnel syndrome) seems likely here. 

Looking at the options, option C is the ulnar nerve at the elbow. Option H is the ulnar nerve at the wrist, but the symptoms here point more to the elbow because the pain is triggered by palpation there. 

Other options like median or radial nerve entrapments would cause different symptoms. For example, carpal tunnel syndrome (median nerve at the wrist) affects the thumb, index, and middle fingers. Radial nerve issues usually involve weakness in wrist extension or numbness on the back of the hand. 

The patient's history of softball pitching might have contributed to repetitive stress on the elbow, possibly leading to the nerve entrapment. The decreased sensation aligns with ulnar nerve function, and the pain upon palpation at the elbow supports the diagnosis.

The symptoms described, including numbness and tingling in the ring and small fingers, along with pain upon palpation of the right elbow, are consistent with ulnar nerve entrapment at the elbow. The ulnar nerve is responsible for sensation in these fingers and runs along the medial side of the elbow. The pain and sensory loss suggest cubital tunnel syndrome. Other options, such as median or radial nerve entrapments, do not fit the described symptoms. 

Answer: C
