Okay, so I have this question about the difference between Gross National Product (GNP) and National Income (NI). I'm a bit rusty on my economics, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that both GNP and NI are measures of economic activity, but they're calculated differently. Let me start by recalling what each term means.

GNP, or Gross National Product, is the total value of all goods and services produced by a country's residents and businesses, regardless of where production takes place. So if a company from Country A has a factory in Country B, the output from that factory would be included in Country A's GNP. GNP focuses on who produces the goods and services, not where they're produced.

On the other hand, National Income (NI) is the total income earned by the factors of production within the country. This includes things like wages, profits, and rents. It's a bit different because it's more about the income generated from the factors of production rather than the total output. I think NI also subtracts certain things like depreciation and indirect taxes. Wait, depreciation is the wear and tear on machinery and equipment, right? And indirect taxes are taxes on production, like excise taxes. So NI is calculated by taking GNP and then subtracting these deductions.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A says GNP is total income, and NI is earned by individuals. That doesn't sound right because GNP isn't just income; it's the total output value. Also, NI includes more than just individuals, like profits from businesses.

Option B: GNP is the value of all goods and services produced, NI is the total income earned by contributors after deductions. That aligns with what I was thinking. NI is GNP minus depreciation and taxes.

Option C talks about borders, saying GNP includes only domestic income and NI includes foreign. No, I think both include all sources as long as they're produced or earned by the country's residents.

Option D refers to finished vs raw products. GNP is about finished goods, but NI isn't directly about products; it's about income from production factors.

Option E mentions total income from domestic and foreign sources for GNP, and NI from foreign investments. That doesn't fit because NI isn't just about foreign investments; it's about all income from production.

Option F says GNP is market value of all final goods, NI is sum of wages, profits, rents. That's partially correct, but NI also includes other factors and subtracts some items.

Option G compares output vs input. Not quite; both relate to output but measure different aspects.

Option H talks about government vs consumer spending. That's more about different components of GDP or GNP, not NI.

Option I says GNP is corporate income, NI includes only citizens. No, NI includes all residents, and GNP includes all production regardless of who earns it.

Option J is about exports and imports. That's more about trade balances, not GNP or NI.

So, after going through each option, Option B seems to correctly state that GNP is the total production value, while NI is the income from contributors after deductions like taxes and depreciation. That matches my understanding.

The correct answer is B: GNP is the value of all goods and services produced in a year, while NI is the total income earned by those who contribute to current production, after deductions for indirect taxes, depreciation, and the use of capital.

The answer is B.

Answer: B
