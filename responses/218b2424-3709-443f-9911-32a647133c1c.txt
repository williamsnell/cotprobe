Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to find the Laplace transform of a piecewise function g(t). The function is defined as 0 when t is less than 4 and (t - 4)^2 when t is greater than or equal to 4. Hmm, I remember that Laplace transforms are useful for converting time-domain functions into the frequency domain, which can make solving differential equations easier. But I'm a bit rusty on the exact steps, so let me think this through carefully.

First, I should recall the definition of the Laplace transform. The Laplace transform of a function g(t) is given by the integral from 0 to infinity of e^(-st) g(t) dt. So, L{g(t)} = ∫₀^∞ e^(-st) g(t) dt.

But wait, in this case, g(t) is zero for t < 4 and (t-4)^2 for t >=4. That means the function only starts contributing to the integral at t=4. So, the integral actually has two parts: from 0 to 4, where g(t)=0, and from 4 to infinity, where g(t)=(t-4)^2.

So, the integral simplifies to the integral from 4 to infinity of e^(-st) (t-4)^2 dt. That makes sense. Now, I remember that there's a property of the Laplace transform called the time-shifting theorem, which deals with functions that start at a certain time, like t=a. I think it says that if you have a function f(t) that's zero for t < a and f(t-a) for t >= a, then the Laplace transform is e^(-as) F(s), where F(s) is the Laplace transform of f(t). 

In this problem, our function starts at t=4, so a=4. So, f(t) here would be (t-4)^2, but wait, more accurately, f(t) is (t)^2 shifted by 4 units. So, f(t) is (t)^2, and the shifted function is (t-4)^2. So, the Laplace transform of f(t-a) is e^(-as) F(s). Therefore, L{(t-4)^2 u(t-4)} = e^(-4s) L{t^2}, where u(t-4) is the unit step function starting at t=4.

So, I need to find L{t^2} first. I think the Laplace transform of t^n is n! / s^(n+1). So for n=2, it should be 2! / s^3 = 2/s^3. So, L{t^2} = 2/s^3.

Putting it all together, L{(t-4)^2 u(t-4)} = e^(-4s) * (2/s^3). So, the Laplace transform is (2 e^(-4s))/s^3.

Looking at the options, option A is (2e^-4s)/s^3, which matches what I just got. Let me check the other options to make sure I didn't miss anything. Option B is 2/s^3, which seems like just the transform without the time shift, so that's not right. Option C is (2/s^2) e^(-4s), but I had 2/s^3. Option D is 4/s^3, which is double what I have. Option E is 2e^-4s / s^4, which is a different power. Option F is (2/s^3) e^(-s), which uses s instead of 4s in the exponent, so that's wrong. Option G is e^-4s, which is missing the denominator. Option H is e^-4s / s^2, again the denominator is wrong. Option I is (2/s) e^-4s, which is 2/s times the exponential, but I had 2/s^3. Option J is (t^2 -8t +16)/s, which seems like it's not even taking the Laplace transform correctly, because t terms can't be in the transform.

Wait a second, did I apply the time-shifting correctly? Let me double-check. The function is zero before t=4, so yes, a=4. So, shifting t by 4, the function becomes (t')^2 where t' = t-4. So, L{(t')^2 u(t')} = 2/s^3, then multiply by e^(-4s) because of the shift. So yes, I think I did that right.

Alternatively, I could compute the integral directly. Let me try that approach to confirm. The integral from 4 to infinity of e^(-st) (t-4)^2 dt. Let me make a substitution: let u = t -4. Then when t=4, u=0, and when t approaches infinity, u approaches infinity. So, the integral becomes the integral from 0 to infinity of e^(-s(u+4)) u^2 du. Expanding that, e^(-4s) e^(-su) u^2. So, e^(-4s) ∫₀^∞ u^2 e^(-su) du. The integral ∫ u^2 e^(-su) du from 0 to ∞ is known; that's the Laplace transform of u^2, which is 2/s^3. So, the whole thing becomes e^(-4s) * 2/s^3, which again is option A.

I think I'm confident now that option A is the correct answer.

The Laplace transform of the given piecewise function is found using the time-shifting property. The function is zero for \( t < 4 \) and \( (t - 4)^2 \) for \( t \geq 4 \). Applying the shift theorem, the transform is \( e^{-4s} \) times the transform of \( t^2 \), which is \( 2/s^3 \). Thus, the result is \( (2e^{-4s})/s^3 \), corresponding to option A.
