Options:

A: The firm should maintain the current level of labor so that the MRPL will remain constant.

Okay, so I've got this economics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question says: A firm hires labor for $15 each and sells its products for $3 each. The marginal product of the 3rd worker is 10. Which statement is most true?

Hmm, marginal product of labor, right? MP is the additional output a worker brings. So the 3rd worker adds 10 units to production.

I remember that in economics, firms should hire workers up to the point where the marginal revenue product (MRPL) equals the wage rate. MRPL is the marginal product multiplied by the marginal revenue, which is the price of the product if it's perfectly competitive and marginal revenue equals price. Here, the product sells for $3 each, so MR is $3.

So, MRPL would be MP * MR. For the 3rd worker, that's 10 * 3 = $30. The wage is $15, so MRPL ($30) is greater than the wage ($15). That means hiring this worker adds more revenue than the cost, so the firm should hire more workers.

Wait, but what about the next worker after that? Let me think. The question is about the 3rd worker. If the MRPL for the 3rd is $30, which is higher than the wage, it's profitable to hire them. But what about the 4th worker? I don't have the MP for the 4th, but generally, as more workers are added, MP tends to decrease due to diminishing returns.

So, the firm should keep hiring until MRPL equals the wage. Since the 3rd worker's MRPL is higher than the wage, the firm should hire more. So the statement should be about hiring more labor so that MRPL decreases, because as they add more workers, the MP will drop, thus MRPL will go down.

Looking at the options, let's go through them:

A: Maintain current labor so MRPL remains constant. But we know MRPL is higher than wage, so they should hire more to increase profit.

B: Hire more so MRPL decreases. Wait, that makes sense because as more workers are added, MP goes down, so MRPL would decrease. But the firm should do this until MRPL equals wage.

C: Hire less to increase MRPL. No, because MRPL would only increase if they hire fewer workers, but that's not the case here since MRPL is already higher than wage.

D: Increase price to decrease MRPL. Not sure, but price affects revenue, but the firm's MRPL is based on the product's price. If they increase price, MR would go up, so MRPL would too, but that's not directly the issue here.

E: Increase price to increase MRPL. Again, not the main point. The issue is whether to hire more workers, not changing the price.

F: Hire less so MRPL decreases. No, because with higher workers, MRPL would naturally decrease, but since MRPL is above wage, hiring more is better.

G: Reduce product price to increase MRPL. That would lower MR, thus lowering MRPL, which isn't helpful.

H: Hire more so MRPL increases. Wait, but as you hire more workers, MP decreases, so MRPL would actually decrease, not increase. So H might not be correct.

I: Maintain current labor so MRPL decreases. But if they maintain, MRPL stays the same, but since it's higher than wage, they should hire more.

J: Maintain current labor so MRPL increases. That doesn't make sense because maintaining labor doesn't change MRPL; it's already at $30. They need to see if they should hire another worker.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me clarify. The firm should hire workers as long as MRPL > wage. Here, MRPL is $30, wage is $15. So they should hire the 3rd worker. What about the 4th? If MP of the 4th is, say, 9, then MRPL would be 9*3=27, which is still higher than 15. So they should hire more. They should keep doing this until MRPL equals wage.

But the question is about the 3rd worker. So the firm should hire more workers because MRPL is higher than the wage. But looking at the options, which one matches this?

Option B says hire more so that MRPL decreases. That makes sense because as they add more workers, MP (and thus MRPL) will decrease. But the firm should continue until MRPL equals wage.

So among the options, B and H are about hiring more. H says MRPL increases, which isn't right because adding more workers would lower MRPL. So the correct reasoning is that the firm should hire more until MRPL equals wage, which in this case, since MRPL is higher, they should hire more, causing MRPL to decrease as they add more workers.

So the correct answer is B: The firm should hire more labor so that the MRPL will decrease.
</think>

The firm should hire more labor because the MRPL ($30) for the 3rd worker is greater than the wage ($15). By hiring additional workers, the firm can continue to increase its profit until MRPL equals the wage. As more workers are added, the marginal product (MP) of each subsequent worker will likely decrease, causing MRPL to decrease as well. Therefore, the correct statement is that the firm should hire more labor so that the MRPL will decrease.

Answer: B
