Question:

This question refers to the following information.
Read the excerpts below.
This corruption is repeatedly designated by Paul by the term sin . . . such as adultery, fornication, theft, hatred, murder, revellings, he terms, in the same way, the fruits of sin, though in various passages of Scripture . . . we are, merely on account of such corruption, deservedly condemned by God, to whom nothing is acceptable but righteousness, innocence, and purity.
—John Calvin, from The Institutes of Christian Religion, Book 2: Chapter 1, 1545
The covenant of life is not preached equally to all, and among those to whom it is preached, does not always meet with the same reception. This diversity displays the unsearchable depth of the divine judgment, and is without doubt subordinate to God's purpose of eternal election. But if it is plainly owing to the mere pleasure of God that salvation is spontaneously offered to some, while others have no access to it, great and difficult questions immediately arise, questions which are inexplicable, when just views are not entertained concerning election and predestination[,] . . . the grace of God being illustrated by the contrast, viz., that he does not adopt all promiscuously to the hope of salvation, but gives to some what he denies to others.
—John Calvin, from The Institutes of Christian Religion, Book 3: Chapter 21, 1545

Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about Calvinism versus Lutheranism. The question is asking what's the biggest contrast between their ideas. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I need to understand the context. The question refers to two excerpts from John Calvin's "Institutes of Christian Religion." The first excerpt talks about sin and how humans are deserving of condemnation because of corruption, and God requires righteousness, innocence, and purity. The second excerpt discusses the covenant of life not being preached equally, the diversity in reception, and the idea of predestination, where God's grace is given to some but not others. It also mentions that without proper views on election, difficult questions arise.

So, Calvin is emphasizing predestination here. He's saying that salvation is by God's grace alone, not based on human efforts. That's a key Calvinist doctrine—predestination, where God chooses who will be saved, and this is not based on human merit or works.

Now, looking at the options, I need to find which one highlights the biggest contrast between Calvinists and Lutherans.

Option A says Lutherans believed in salvation through faith alone, while Calvinists emphasized good works. Wait, isn't that backwards? I thought both Lutherans and Calvinists agree on salvation by faith alone, but Calvinists added the concept of predestination. So maybe A is incorrect because both might have similar views on faith alone.

Option B states Calvinists believed in predestination while Lutherans advocated for free will. That makes sense because Calvin's excerpt clearly talks about predestination and God's election, whereas Lutherans generally believe in free will in salvation, meaning people can respond to God's grace through faith. So B seems like a strong candidate.

Option C is about individual Bible interpretation. Lutherans did stress individual reading, but Calvinists also emphasized that. Not sure if this is the biggest contrast.

Option D is about consubstantiation vs. transubstantiation. That's about the Eucharist. Lutherans believe in consubstantiation, where Christ is present in, with, and under the elements. Calvinists often take a symbolic view. But I'm not sure if this is the biggest contrast between their theologies overall.

Option E: Calvinists rejected saints, Lutherans honored them. Lutherans don't typically venerate saints as much as Catholics, but Calvinists might have been even more against them. Not sure if this is the main contrast.

Option F: Lutherans believe in the literal presence, Calvinists symbolic. That's similar to D, about the Eucharist. Not the main point of difference.

Option G: Lutherans kept seven sacraments, Calvinists two. Lutherans actually kept seven but saw them differently than Catholics. Calvinists reduced sacraments to two, baptism and the Eucharist. But is that the biggest contrast? Maybe, but perhaps not as central as predestination.

Option H: Calvinists believe state is subordinate to religious org. Not sure about this. Both had views on church and state, but not sure if this is the main contrast.

Option I: Lutherans preferred hierarchical church, Calvinists egalitarian. Calvinist churches were more congregational, which is more egalitarian. Lutherans maintained a more hierarchical structure. This could be a contrast, but is it the biggest?

Option J: Lutherans used reformed faith for political advantage. That's more about the Protestant Reformation's impact, like breaking from the pope. Not sure if it's the main theological contrast.

So, going back, the biggest contrast is likely about predestination. Calvinists believed in predestination, where God elects some to salvation regardless of their actions, while Lutherans believed in salvation through faith, which requires a response to God's grace but doesn't emphasize predestination in the same deterministic way. So Option B seems correct.

The biggest contrast between Calvinists and Lutherans is that Calvinists believed in predestination, where salvation is determined solely by God's election, while Lutherans emphasized free will in salvation, believing that individuals can respond to God's grace through faith. 

Answer: B
