Answer the following multiple choice question, selecting from the answer A through to J. After thinking, reply directly with your answer. 

The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

What factors facilitated the institutional innovation of security studies?

Options:

A: The need for civilian expertise, a need driven by technological developments, resulted in a shift from targeted development of fast-changing technologies to deployment of a given technology.
B: Theory was necessary because nuclear technology was inherently more empirical, seen as what would be controlled by the bottom line of probable occurrences in a given conflict situation - the game of deterrence.
C: Broader political considerations about the potential implications of long-term mobilization resulted in a shift from tactical operations to long-term strategy.
D: The combination of nuclear weapons and Cold War political considerations required a highly cohesive, strong military leadership to coordinate economic, political and military planning.

Okay, so I need to figure out which option correctly answers the question: What factors facilitated the institutional innovation of security studies? The options are A through D, and I have to choose the right one.

First, I should understand what the question is asking. Institutional innovation in security studies refers to changes or advancements in how security is studied and approached institutionally. This could involve new methods, theories, or structures within academic or policy-making institutions that focus on security.

Now, looking at each option:

Option A: Talks about the need for civilian expertise driven by technological developments. It mentions a shift from targeted development to deployment of technology. So it's suggesting that as technology advanced, there was a need for more civilian input in security matters. This could relate to how institutions adapt to new tech, maybe through integrating civilian experts into security planning.

Option B: States that theory was necessary because nuclear technology was more empirical. It says nuclear tech is controlled by probable occurrences, like deterrence games. So this is about how nuclear weapons required a theoretical approach based on probable outcomes, like deterrence theory. This could tie into how institutions developed theories to understand and manage nuclear threats.

Option C: Discusses broader political considerations about long-term mobilization leading to a shift from tactical to long-term strategy. This implies that political factors made institutions move from focusing on immediate operations to planning for longer-term strategies, which might involve more comprehensive security studies.

Option D: Combines nuclear weapons with Cold War politics, requiring strong military leadership to coordinate various aspects like economy, politics, and military. This suggests that the combination of these factors necessitated a cohesive leadership structure, which could have driven institutional changes in how security is managed.

Thinking about institutional innovation in security studies, I know that during the Cold War, especially with the advent of nuclear weapons, there was a significant shift in how security was analyzed. Traditional military tactics were insufficient, leading to the development of new theories like deterrence theory, game theory, and the establishment of think tanks and academic departments focused on security studies.

Option B mentions that nuclear technology was inherently more empirical and required theory based on probable occurrences. This aligns with the rise of deterrence theory, which was a significant part of security studies. Theorists like Bernard Brodie and others developed ideas around nuclear strategy, which were empirical in nature and based on probable outcomes in conflicts.

Option D talks about the need for cohesive military leadership, but I think that's more about operational coordination rather than the institutional innovation in studies. Option C is about political implications leading to long-term strategy, which is relevant but perhaps more about policy than the institutional development of the field itself.

Option A's focus on technological developments and civilian expertise is also a factor, as technology like nuclear weapons required specialized knowledge beyond traditional military expertise. However, the question is about institutional innovation, which might be more about the theories and structures rather than just technology.

So between B and A, I think B is more about the theoretical underpinnings that facilitated the institutional changes. The need for theory to understand and manage nuclear threats likely drove the creation of new institutions and methods in security studies.

The correct answer is B: Theory was necessary because nuclear technology was inherently more empirical, seen as what would be controlled by the bottom line of probable occurrences in a given conflict situation - the game of deterrence.

Answer: B
