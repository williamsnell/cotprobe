Okay, so I've got this problem here about gases in connected bulbs. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, okay, so there are two bulbs connected by a valve. One bulb is 3 liters with oxygen at 195 torr, and the other is 2 liters with nitrogen at 530 torr. The valve is opened, and they equilibrate at constant temperature. I need to find the equilibrium pressure.

Wait, I remember that when two gases are mixed at the same temperature, their pressures add up, but wait, no, that's not exactly right. Oh wait, no, because the volume changes when the valve is opened. So maybe I should think about the total pressure in terms of the total moles or something.

Oh right, the combined gas law could be useful here. Since temperature is constant, I can use Boyle's Law or Dalton's Law for partial pressures. Let me think. Each gas will expand into the total volume. So the total volume after connecting is 3 + 2 = 5 liters.

Wait, but each gas will expand into the combined volume. So for each gas, the pressure would change based on their initial conditions and the new volume.

Let me break it down for each gas. For oxygen: initially in 3 L at 195 torr. When the valve opens, it expands into 5 L. So using Boyle's Law, P1V1 = P2V2. For oxygen, P1 is 195 torr, V1 is 3 L, V2 is 5 L. So P2 = (195 * 3) / 5. Let me calculate that: 195 *3 is 585, divided by 5 is 117 torr. So the oxygen's pressure would be 117 torr in the new volume.

For nitrogen: initial pressure is 530 torr in 2 L. So using the same approach, P1 is 530, V1 is 2, V2 is 5. So P2 = (530 *2)/5. 530*2 is 1060, divided by 5 is 212 torr. So nitrogen contributes 212 torr.

Now the total pressure is the sum of both partial pressures. So 117 + 212 = 329 torr. Looking at the options, E is 329 torr. So the answer should be E.

The equilibrium pressure is calculated by determining the partial pressures of oxygen and nitrogen after they expand into the combined volume of 5 liters. Using Boyle's Law, the partial pressure of oxygen is (195 torr × 3 L) / 5 L = 117 torr, and the partial pressure of nitrogen is (530 torr × 2 L) / 5 L = 212 torr. Adding these gives a total pressure of 329 torr.

Answer: E
