Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics question. The question is about the likelihood of an individual carrying two specific alleles of a human DNA marker. Each allele has a frequency of 0.2 in the population. Hmm, I remember that allele frequency relates to how common a particular allele is in a population. 

Wait, so each allele has a frequency of 0.2. I think I need to find the probability that a person has both of these alleles. But wait, are these alleles at the same locus or different loci? Oh, right, DNA markers are usually at specific loci, so I guess each allele is for the same gene. So, the person would have two alleles for that gene, one from each parent.

But wait, do I need to consider Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium here? Because that's when the population is in equilibrium, and allele frequencies can be used to calculate genotype frequencies. The Hardy-Weinberg principle states that p² + 2pq + q² = 1, where p and q are the frequencies of two alleles. But in this case, I'm only given that each allele has a frequency of 0.2. Wait, that can't be right because if p and q are both 0.2, then p + q would be 0.4, which is less than 1. Oh, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Perhaps the alleles are the same, so we're looking for the probability of having two copies of the same allele.

Wait, no, the question says two specific alleles. So maybe each allele is present, but they're different. So, for example, allele A has a frequency of 0.2, and allele B also has a frequency of 0.2. But wait, the question says each has a frequency of 0.2, so perhaps they are the same allele. Wait, that can't be because each allele is a variant. Oh, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the alleles are the same, so each is 0.2. But wait, that would mean that the frequency of the allele is 0.2, so the probability of a person having two copies would be the square of that, right? Because for diploid organisms, the probability of having two copies is p squared. So if p is 0.2, then p squared is 0.04. But wait, looking at the options, option H is 0.04. But wait, let me make sure.

Wait, no, perhaps I'm confusing dominant and recessive alleles. Or maybe the alleles are different. Let me think: if each allele has a frequency of 0.2, and we're looking for the frequency of a heterozygote, which is 2pq. But wait, if p is 0.2 and q is 0.2, then 2*(0.2)*(0.2) = 0.08. That's option I. But wait, the question is about carrying two specific alleles. So maybe it's the probability of being homozygous for each. Or maybe it's the probability of having both alleles, but perhaps it's the same allele twice.

Wait, let me clarify the question: "the likelihood of an individual in a population carrying two specific alleles... each of which has a frequency of 0.2." So each allele has a frequency of 0.2. So for two specific alleles, perhaps each is 0.2, but wait, that would mean they're the same allele. Or maybe they're two different alleles each with frequency 0.2.

Wait, this is confusing. Let me think again. If each allele has a frequency of 0.2, then perhaps it's the same allele, so the frequency is 0.2, and the chance of having two copies is 0.2 * 0.2 = 0.04, which is option H. But wait, that would be the case if the question was about being homozygous recessive, but maybe the two alleles are different. Wait, but if they're different, like alleles A and a, each with frequency 0.2, then the heterozygote frequency would be 2 * 0.2 * 0.2 = 0.08, which is option I. But the question says "two specific alleles of a human DNA marker," which suggests they're the same locus, so perhaps the two alleles are for the same gene. So, maybe the question is about the genotype that has both alleles, but that doesn't make sense because a diploid individual has two alleles, but they're either the same (homozygous) or different (heterozygous).

Wait, perhaps the question is more about linkage or something else. Alternatively, maybe the alleles are at different loci, and we're looking for the probability of having both alleles in the genome. But that seems more complex and perhaps beyond the scope of the question.

Wait, perhaps the question is simpler. Maybe it's asking for the probability that an individual has both alleles, each with a frequency of 0.2, regardless of their type. So, if each has a 0.2 chance, then the probability of having both is 0.2 * 0.2 = 0.04, which is option H. But that would be if they are independent events, but in reality, allele frequencies are not independent because the total frequency must sum to 1. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, another approach: In a Hardy-Weinberg population, the frequency of the homozygous genotype is p². So if p is 0.2, then p² is 0.04, which is option H. So the answer would be H. But wait, the question is about two specific alleles, so if each allele has a frequency of 0.2, perhaps they're the same, so the chance of having two copies is 0.04. Alternatively, if the alleles are different, perhaps the chance is 0.08, but that's for a heterozygote.

Wait, but the question says "two specific alleles," which might imply that they are the same allele. So the chance is p² = 0.04, which is option H. But let me double-check.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the probability of having either of the two alleles, but that doesn't seem right because the question specifies two specific alleles, meaning both.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the probability that a person has both alleles. So if each allele has a frequency of 0.2, and assuming they are independent (which they're not in reality), the probability would be 0.2 * 0.2 = 0.04. So the answer would be H. But in reality, in Hardy-Weinberg, the frequencies are not independent because p + q + r + ... = 1. But perhaps the question is oversimplified, so we go with p squared.
</think>

The question asks for the likelihood of an individual carrying two specific alleles, each with a frequency of 0.2. Assuming Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the probability of being homozygous for an allele with frequency \( p = 0.2 \) is \( p^2 = 0.04 \). This corresponds to option H.

Answer: H
