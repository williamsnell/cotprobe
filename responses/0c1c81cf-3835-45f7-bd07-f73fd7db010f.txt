Okay, so I have this question about Pence's article "Will Cloning Harm People?" and I need to figure out what his main objective is. The options are from A to J, each representing a different ethical approach or argument. 

First, I should probably recall who Pence is. I think Pence is a philosopher who has written on bioethics, including cloning. From what I remember, he's written articles discussing the ethical implications of cloning, particularly from a Kantian perspective. 

The question is asking about his main objective in this specific article. The options involve different ethical theories: Kant's humanity formulation, consequentialism, virtue ethics, utilitarianism, etc. 

I remember that in his work, Pence often uses Kant's humanity formulation, which is part of Kantian ethics. The humanity formulation states that one should treat humanity as an end in itself, not as a means to an end. So, if cloning is being discussed, maybe he's using this principle to argue against cloning.

Looking at the options, A says he uses Kant's humanity formulation to show cloning is morally acceptable. That seems unlikely because if he's using the formulation correctly, it might argue against cloning if it treats people as means. Option E says he uses it to show cloning is immoral, which aligns more with what I remember. 

Another angle is the consequentialist or utilitarian arguments. Options C and F suggest using these to show immorality, while J and B use them to show acceptability. Pence, being a Kantian, probably focuses more on deontological ethics rather than consequentialist ones, so maybe he's not using those as much. 

Options G and I are about objecting to other arguments. If he's countering consequentialist or Kantian-based arguments, but I think his main approach is to present his own view using Kant's formulation. 

So, putting it together, Pence's main objective is likely to use Kant's humanity formulation to argue that cloning is immoral. That would make option E the correct choice.

The main objective of Pence's article is to use Kant's humanity formulation to argue that cloning is immoral.
