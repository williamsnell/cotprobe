<think>
Okay, so I've got this question about FM receivers and signal-to-noise ratios (SNR). Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my communications systems, but let me try to think this through.

The question states that an FM receiver has an input SNR of 40 dB. It's used to pick up signals from different FM stations. The transmitted FM signal is given by km(t) = β * ω * cos(ωmt). I need to calculate the output SNR for β values of 5, 10, and 105. The options are A through J, each giving different dB values for each β.

First, I remember that in FM, the signal-to-noise ratio at the receiver output depends on the frequency deviation and the input SNR. Oh wait, I think the formula involves the square of the modulation index β. Because FM's SNR improvement comes from the fact that the signal is spread out over a wider bandwidth, which reduces the noise effect.

I recall the formula for the output SNR in FM. If I'm not mistaken, the output SNR (Sout) is given by the input SNR (Sin) plus 2 times the square of the modulation index β, all converted to linear terms, then back to dB.

Wait, let me get that right. The formula is:

Sout (dB) = Sin (dB) + 20 * log10(β)

Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Because when dealing with SNR in FM, the noise is spread over a larger bandwidth, so the noise power decreases. The SNR gains because the noise is spread, which is proportional to the square of the modulation index.

Wait, I think the correct formula is Sout = Sin + 20 log10(β^2), but wait, that would be 40 log10(β). Hmm, no, let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the output SNR improvement is given by Sout = Sin + 20 log10(β), because the noise is spread into a bandwidth that's β times wider than the baseband, so the SNR increases by a factor of β squared, which in dB is 10 log10(β²) = 20 log10(β). So yes, Sout = Sin + 20 log10(β).

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, I might be mixing up AM and FM. In AM, the SNR improvement is different because the carrier is stronger. For FM, the SNR at the receiver output is given by:

Sout = Sin + 20 log10(β)

Wait, let's confirm that. The input SNR is the ratio of signal to noise at the input to the FM demodulator. The FM system's noise is spread over a bandwidth of B = B_baseband * β. So the noise power is S_n / (B * β), because the noise is spread over a wider bandwidth. The signal power remains the same, so the output SNR would be (S_i / (B)) divided by (S_n / (B * β)) ), which simplifies to (S_i / S_n) * β. So the SNR improves by a factor of β.

But wait, that's in terms of linear terms. To convert to dB, the improvement is 10 log10(β). Because SNR in dB is 10 log10(Signal/Noise). So if the output SNR is β times the input SNR, then the output SNR in dB is Sin_dB + 10 log10(β).

Wait, but that doesn't align with what I thought earlier. I'm getting confused here.

Wait, let me try to approach this step by step.

Let me denote the input SNR as Sin = S_i / n_f = 40 dB.

In FM, the noise is spread over a bandwidth that's proportional to β. The baseband noise is n_f, but in FM, the equivalent noise bandwidth is β times the baseband bandwidth. So the noise power in the FM receiver is n_f / β, because the noise is spread over a larger bandwidth.

So the output SNR (Sout) is (S_i) / (n_f / β) ) = (S_i / n_f) * β = Sin * β.

So in linear terms, Sout = Sin * β.

But since Sin is given in dB, I need to convert it to a linear ratio, multiply by β, then convert back to dB.

So the steps are:

1. Convert Sin from dB to linear: Sin_linear = 10^(Sin_dB / 10) = 10^(40/10) = 10^4 = 10000.

2. Multiply by β: Sout_linear = Sin_linear * β.

3. Convert back to dB: Sout_dB = 10 * log10(Sout_linear) = 10 * log10(10000 * β) = 10 * (log10(10000) + log10(β)) = 10*(4 + log10(β)) = 40 + 10 log10(β).

Wait, that makes sense. So the output SNR is 40 dB plus 10 times the log base 10 of β.

Let me test this with β=5:

log10(5) ≈ 0.69897. So 10 * 0.69897 ≈ 6.9897 dB. Adding to 40 gives 46.9897 dB, approximately 47 dB. Wait, but looking at the options, none of the options for β=5 have 47 dB. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe the formula is different. Another approach: The output SNR in FM is given by Sout = Sin + 20 log10(β). Let me see if that makes sense.

Wait, for β=5, 20 log10(5) ≈ 20 * 0.69897 ≈ 13.979 dB. So 40 + 13.979 ≈ 53.98 dB, which is about 54 dB. But looking at the options, option B for β=5 is 55.7 dB, option A is 58.7, etc.

Hmm, this is conflicting with my earlier approach. So which formula is correct?

Wait, perhaps I should refer to the standard formula for FM SNR.

Upon checking, the output SNR in FM is given by:

Sout = Sin + 20 log10(β)

Wait, but now I'm confused because different sources might present it differently. Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is Sout = Sin + 10 log10(β²) = Sin + 20 log10(β).

So let me proceed with that.

So for β=5:

20 log10(5) ≈ 13.979 → 40 + 13.979 ≈ 53.98 dB, which is approximately 54 dB.

Looking at the options, option B for β=5 is 55.7 dB, which is a bit higher than 54 dB. Hmm, maybe my approach is incorrect.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the output SNR is calculated as the input SNR plus 20 log10(β), but perhaps in the question, the transmitted signal is given by km(t) = β ω cos(ωmt), which implies that the modulation index β is the ratio of the frequency deviation to the modulating frequency. So perhaps the formula is correct.

Wait, but the options don't have 54 dB for β=5. The closest is option B:55.7, which is a bit higher. Maybe I should compute more accurately.

Let me compute 20 log10(5) precisely.

log10(5) = 0.69897000433...

So 20 * 0.69897 = 13.9794.

40 +13.9794 = 53.9794 dB, which is approximately 54 dB.

But none of the options have 54 dB for β=5. The closest is option B:55.7, which is higher. So perhaps I'm missing something in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula is Sout = Sin + 20 log10(β) + 10 log10(1 + β²/2), but that might be for a different scenario, like including some approximation for the FM signal's power.

Wait, another thought: The FM signal's power is proportional to (1 + β²/2), so perhaps the SNR calculation includes that factor.

Wait, let me think about the signal power and noise power.

In FM, the transmitted signal's power is P = (A^2) (1 + β²/2), where A is the amplitude. The noise power is N = k*T*B, where B is the bandwidth.

The input SNR is Sin = P_Signal / P_Noise = 40 dB.

At the receiver, after demodulation, the output SNR depends on how the signal and noise are spread.

Wait, the FM signal's bandwidth is approximately B = B_baseband * β, where B_baseband is the bandwidth of the modulating signal.

The noise in the FM receiver is spread over a bandwidth of B = β * B_baseband, so the noise power is N = k*T*(β B_baseband).

The signal power in FM is P = A² (1 + (β^2)/2) * B_baseband.

Wait, but perhaps the signal power is the same as the input signal's power, and the noise is spread over a wider bandwidth.

Wait, maybe the output SNR is given by:

Sout = (P_signal) / (P_noise / β )

Because the noise is spread over β times the bandwidth, reducing its power by a factor of β.

So Sout = Sin * β.

In dB, that would be Sin_dB + 10 log10(β).

Wait, let's test that.

For β=5, 10 log10(5) ≈ 6.9897 dB. So 40 +6.9897≈46.99 dB, which is about 47 dB. But none of the options have that.

Hmm, so perhaps I'm using the wrong formula. Let me check a textbook formula.

Upon checking, the output SNR for FM is given by:

Sout = Sin + 20 log10(β)

Which aligns with the earlier approach.

So for β=5, 20 log10(5)=13.979 dB, so Sout=40+13.979=53.979 dB ≈54 dB.

But looking at the options, the closest is option B: β=5 →55.7 dB, which is higher than 54 dB.

Wait, perhaps the formula is Sout = Sin + 20 log10(β) + 10 log10(1 + β²/2), but that would complicate things.

Alternatively, maybe the formula is Sout = Sin + 20 log10(β) + some factor, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think differently. The output SNR in FM is given by:

Sout = Sin + 20 log10(β) + 10 log10( (1 + β^2/2) )

Wait, but that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Sout = Sin + 20 log10(β) + 10 log10(1 + β^2/4 ), but I'm not certain.

Wait, maybe another approach: The FM signal's power is P = (A^2)(1 + β²/2), and the noise power is N = k*T*B_total, where B_total = β * B.

The input SNR is Sin = P_Signal / N = (A^2 (1 + β²/2)) / (k T B) ) = 40 dB.

At the receiver, after FM demodulation, the signal is the baseband signal, which has power P_out = A² (1 + β²/2) / 2, and the noise is N_out = k T (B_total / β) ) = k T B.

Wait, perhaps I'm complicating this. Let me try to calculate the output SNR.

Wait, the output SNR is S_out = (Signal Power) / (Noise Power).

The signal power after demodulation is P_signal_out = (A^2) (1 + β²/2).

The noise power at the output is P_noise_out = (k T) * (B_total / β ), since the noise bandwidth is B_total = β B, but the output noise bandwidth is B, so the noise power is (k T) * (B_total / β) ) = (k T B) * (β / β ) = k T B.

Wait, that can't be right because that would make P_noise_out = k T B, same as before. But then the output SNR would be the same as the input SNR, which doesn't make sense.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something here. Maybe I should refer to the standard formula.

Upon checking, the correct formula for the output SNR in FM is:

Sout = Sin + 20 log10(β)

So, applying this:

For β=5:

20 * log10(5) ≈13.979 dB → Sout=40+13.979≈53.98 dB≈54 dB.

But none of the options have 54 dB for β=5. The closest is option B:55.7 dB, which is higher.

Wait, perhaps the formula is different. Another source says that the output SNR for FM is given by:

Sout = Sin + 10 log10(β² + 1) → which would be 10 log10(β² +1).

Wait, for β=5, that would be 10 log10(25 +1)=10 log10(26)=10 * 1.41497=14.1497 dB. So Sout=40+14.1497=54.1497≈54.15 dB.

Still not matching any option.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Sout = Sin + 20 log10(β) + 10 log10(1 + (β^2)/2).

For β=5:

20 log10(5)=13.979, and 10 log10(1 + 25/2)=10 log10(13.5)=10 * 1.1303=11.303.

So total Sout=40+13.979+11.303=65.282 dB. That's way higher than the options.

Hmm, this is getting confusing. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps the formula is Sout = Sin + 10 log10(β^2 +1), which for β=5 is 10 log10(26)≈14.14 dB, so 40+14.14=54.14 dB.

But again, no option matches that.

Wait, perhaps the formula is Sout = Sin + 20 log10(β) + 10 log10( (1 + β^2/2) ), but that would give even higher values.

Alternatively, maybe the correct formula is Sout = Sin + 10 log10(β^2), which is the same as 20 log10(β), so same as before.

Hmm, perhaps I should calculate each option for β=5, 10, 105 and see which one matches.

Let me compute 20 log10(5) = 13.979 dB. So 40+13.979=53.98 dB≈54 dB.

Looking at the options:

Option B: β=5 →55.7 dB.

Option A: β=5 →58.7.

Hmm, none match 54 dB. Maybe the formula is different.

Wait, perhaps the formula is Sout = Sin + 20 log10(β) + 10 log10( (1 + β^2/2) ).

Wait, for β=5:

20 log10(5)=13.979, 10 log10(1 + 25/2)=10 log10(13.5)=10 * 1.1303=11.303.

Total Sout=40 +13.979 +11.303=65.28 dB.

Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Sout = Sin + 20 log10(β) - 10 dB.

Wait, for β=5, that would be 40 +13.979 -10=43.979 dB, which is not matching any option.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Sout = Sin + 10 log10(β^2 + 1).

Wait, for β=5, that's 10 log10(26)=14.14, so 40+14.14=54.14 dB.

No match.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the output SNR is given by:

Sout = Sin + 20 log10(β) + 10 log10( (1 + β^2/2) / (1 + β^2/2) ) ? No, that doesn't make sense.

Hmm, perhaps I should think in terms of the signal power and noise power.

The FM signal's power is P = (A^2) (1 + β²/2).

The noise power in the FM receiver is N = k T (B_total) = k T (β B_baseband).

The input SNR is Sin = P_Signal / N = (A^2 (1 + β²/2)) / (k T β B_baseband) ) =40 dB.

At the output, after demodulation, the signal power is P_out = (A^2) (1 + β²/2) / 2, because FM demodulation recovers the baseband signal with half the power.

The noise power at the output is N_out = k T B_baseband.

So the output SNR is Sout = P_out / N_out = [ (A^2 (1 + β²/2) / 2 ) ] / [k T B_baseband ].

Which can be written as:

Sout = [ (A^2 (1 + β²/2) ) / (2 k T B_baseband) ) ] = (1/2) * [ (A^2 (1 + β²/2) ) / (k T B_baseband) ) ] = (1/2) * Sin.

Wait, that can't be right because that would mean Sout = Sin / 2, which would reduce the SNR by 3 dB, which doesn't make sense for FM.

I must be making a mistake here. Let me try again.

Wait, the input SNR is Sin = (A^2 (1 + β²/2)) / (k T β B_baseband ) ) =40 dB.

At the output, the signal power is P_out = (A^2) (1 + β²/2) / 2.

The noise power is N_out = (k T) * B_baseband.

So Sout = P_out / N_out = [ (A^2 (1 + β²/2) / 2 ) ] / [ k T B_baseband ) ] = (1/2) * [ (A^2 (1 + β²/2) ) / (k T B_baseband) ) ] = (1/2) * [ (A^2 (1 + β²/2) ) / (k T B_baseband) ) ].

But from the input SNR, we have Sin = (A^2 (1 + β²/2) ) / (k T β B_baseband ) ) =40 dB.

So (A^2 (1 + β²/2) ) / (k T B_baseband ) ) = Sin * β.

Thus, Sout = (1/2) * (Sin * β ) = (Sin * β ) / 2.

In dB, that would be Sout_dB = 10 log10( (Sin_linear * β ) / 2 ).

Wait, let's compute that.

Sin_linear = 10^(40/10) = 10^4 =10,000.

So for β=5:

Sout_linear = (10,000 *5 ) / 2 = 25,000.

Sout_dB=10 log10(25,000) =10 log10(2.5e4) =10*(log10(2.5)+4)=10*(0.39794 +4)=10*(4.39794)=43.9794 dB≈44 dB.

But none of the options have 44 dB for β=5.

Wait, this is conflicting. I'm clearly getting mixed results here, which suggests I'm not applying the correct formula.

Perhaps I should try a different approach. Let me look for the standard formula for FM SNR improvement.

Upon checking, the correct formula for the output SNR in FM is:

Sout = Sin + 20 log10(β)

So using this, for β=5:

20 log10(5)=13.979, so Sout=40+13.979=53.98 dB≈54 dB.

Looking at the options, none have exactly 54 dB. The closest is option B:55.7 dB, which is higher.

Wait, perhaps the formula is Sout = Sin + 20 log10(β) + 10 log10( (1 + β^2/2) )

For β=5, that would be:

20 log10(5)=13.979, 10 log10(1+25/2)=10 log10(13.5)=11.303.

Total=40+13.979+11.303=65.28 dB, which is way higher than any option.

Hmm, this is getting frustrating. Maybe I should try calculating each option's Sout for β=5, 10, 105 and see which matches.

Let's take option B:

β=5 →55.7 dB.

So if Sout=55.7 dB, then 20 log10(β)=55.7-40=15.7 dB.

So log10(β)=15.7/20=0.785.

β=10^0.785≈6.11.

But the given β is 5, so this doesn't add up.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Sout = Sin + 10 log10(β² + 1).

For β=5:

10 log10(26)=14.14 dB → Sout=40+14.14=54.14 dB.

Option B's β=5 is 55.7 dB, which is higher.

Wait, perhaps the formula is Sout = Sin + 20 log10(β) + 10 log10( (1 + β²/4) ).

For β=5:

20 log10(5)=13.979, 10 log10(1 +25/4)=10 log10(6.25)=10*(0.79588)=7.9588.

Total=40+13.979+7.9588=61.9378 dB. Not matching.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to compute the output SNR using the formula Sout = Sin + 20 log10(β) for each β and see which option matches.

For β=5: 40 + 20 log10(5)=40+13.979≈53.98 dB≈54 dB.

Looking for 54 dB in the options:

Option B:55.7 dB (β=5), option A:58.7, etc. Not matching.

Wait, perhaps the formula is Sout = Sin + 20 log10(β) + 10 log10( (1 + β^2) ).

For β=5: 10 log10(26)=14.14 → total=40+13.979+14.14=68.119 dB. Not matching.

Hmm, perhaps the correct formula is Sout = Sin + 20 log10(β) + 10 log10( (1 + β^2/2) ), which for β=5 gives 40+13.979+11.303=65.28 dB. No match.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Sout = Sin + 20 log10(β) + 10 log10( (1 + β^2) ), which for β=5 would be 20 log10(5)=13.979, 10 log10(26)=14.14, total 40+13.979+14.14=68.119 dB. Not matching.

I'm stuck. Maybe I should consider that the output SNR is given by Sout = Sin + 20 log10(β) + 10 log10( (1 + β^2/2) / (1 + β^2/2) ), but that cancels out, so no.

Wait, perhaps the formula is Sout = Sin + 20 log10(β) + 10 log10( (1 + β^2/2) ), but that would be a large number.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Sout = Sin + 20 log10(β) + 10 log10( (1 + β^2) ), but again, no.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to realize that the output SNR is 40 dB plus 10 log10(β^2), which is 20 log10(β).

So for β=5, 20 log10(5)=13.979 dB → Sout=53.98 dB≈54 dB.

But none of the options have that.

Looking at the options, option B for β=5 is 55.7 dB, which is higher than 54. Let me compute 20 log10(5) + 40 = 53.98 dB. So the closest would be option B's 55.7, but it's not exact.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me check another source.

Upon checking, the correct formula for output SNR in FM is indeed Sout = Sin + 20 log10(β).

So for β=5, Sout=53.98 dB≈54 dB.

Looking at the options, option B: β=5 →55.7 dB.

Hmm, perhaps the options have a typo, but I need to choose the closest.

Wait, perhaps I should compute for all three β values and see which option matches all.

For β=5: 40 +20 log10(5)=53.98 dB.

For β=10:20 log10(10)=20*1=20 →40+20=60 dB.

For β=105:20 log10(105)=20*(approx 2.021)=40.42 dB →40+40.42=80.42 dB.

Looking at the options:

Option B: β=5→55.7, β=10→61.7, β=105→82.185.

Hmm, for β=10, according to my calculation, it's 60 dB. But option B says 61.7 dB.

Wait, perhaps the formula is Sout = Sin + 20 log10(β) + 10 log10( (1 + β^2/2) ), which for β=10 would be:

20 log10(10)=20, 10 log10(1+100/2)=10 log10(51)=10*1.707=17.07.

Total=40+20+17.07=77.07 dB. Not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Sout = Sin + 20 log10(β) + 10 log10( (1 + β^2/2) ), but that gives higher values.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Sout = Sin + 20 log10(β) + 10 log10( (1 + β^2/2) ), but that again doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the formula is Sout = Sin + 20 log10(β) + 10 log10( (1 + β^2/4) ).

For β=10:

20 log10(10)=20, 10 log10(1+100/4)=10 log10(26)=10*1.41497=14.1497.

Total=40+20+14.1497=74.1497 dB, which is higher than option B's 61.7 dB.

Hmm, I'm not getting anywhere. Maybe I should compute each option's β=5 and see which one is closest to 54 dB.

Option B: β=5→55.7 dB.

Option A: β=5→58.7 dB.

Option C:50 dB.

Option D:52.5 dB.

Option E:60.1 dB.

Option F:47.2 dB.

Option G:45.7 dB.

Option H:65.7 dB.

Option I:43.6 dB.

Option J:42 dB.

The closest to 54 dB is option B:55.7 dB (error ~1.7 dB). Option D is 52.5 dB (error ~1.5 dB). Hmm, that's closer.

Wait, but according to the formula, it's 53.98 dB, so 54 dB. The closest options are B (55.7, +1.7 dB) and D (52.5, -0.5 dB). Hmm, D is closer.

Wait, let me compute for β=10 using the formula Sout=40+20 log10(10)=40+20=60 dB.

Looking at the options:

Option B: β=10→61.7 dB.

Option E: β=10→66.1 dB.

Option D:58.5 dB.

Option A:64.7 dB.

Hmm, none are exactly 60 dB. Closest is option B:61.7 dB (error +1.7 dB).

Similarly, for β=105:

Sout=40 +20 log10(105)=40 +20*(2.021)=40 +40.42=80.42 dB.

Looking at options:

Option B:82.185 dB.

Option E:87.285 dB.

Option D:78.685 dB.

Option A:85.185 dB.

So option B's 82.185 dB is closer than option D's 78.685 dB.

So, for β=5: option B is 55.7 dB (error +1.7 dB).

For β=10: option B is 61.7 dB (error +1.7 dB).

For β=105: option B is82.185 dB (error +1.765 dB).

Hmm, that's consistent across all three β values. So perhaps the correct formula includes an additional 1.7 dB per step, which would suggest that the formula is Sout = Sin + 20 log10(β) + some constant.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Sout = Sin + 20 log10(β) + 10 log10( (1 + β^2/2) ), but that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the question uses a different approach where the output SNR is given by:

Sout = Sin + 20 log10(β) + 10 log10( (1 + β^2/2) )

But that would complicate things further.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Sout = Sin + 20 log10(β) + 10 log10( (1 + β^2) )

But that would make the numbers even higher.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is Sout = Sin + 20 log10(β) + 10 log10( (1 + β^2/2) )

So for β=5: 20 log10(5)=13.979, 10 log10(13.5)=11.303 → total=40+13.979+11.303=65.28 dB.

But that's way higher than any option.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for an option where β=10 gives 60 dB, which would be exactly 40+20=60. Looking at the options, none of them have β=10 at 60 dB. The closest is option B:61.7 dB.

Wait, perhaps the formula is Sout = Sin + 20 log10(β) + 10 log10( (1 + β^2/2) )

For β=10: 20 log10(10)=20, 10 log10(51)=10*1.707=17.07 → total=40+20+17.07=77.07 dB. Not matching.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider that the output SNR is given by:

Sout = Sin + 20 log10(β) + 10 log10( (1 + β^2/4) )

For β=5: 20 log10(5)=13.979, 10 log10(1 +6.25)=10 log10(7.25)=10*0.8601=8.601 → total=40+13.979+8.601=62.58 dB.

Not matching.

Wait, perhaps the formula is Sout = Sin + 20 log10(β) + 10 log10( (1 + β^2/8) )

For β=5: 20 log10(5)=13.979, 10 log10(1 + 25/8)=10 log10(4.125)=10*0.6156=6.156 → total=40+13.979+6.156=59.135 dB.

Not matching.

I'm not making progress here. Perhaps the correct approach is to choose the option where each β value's Sout is 20 log10(β) added to 40 dB.

Looking at the options:

Option B for β=5:55.7 dB.

Compute 55.7-40=15.7 dB. So 20 log10(β)=15.7 → log10(β)=0.785 → β=10^0.785≈6.11. But the given β is 5, which doesn't match.

Hmm, perhaps the formula is Sout = Sin + 20 log10(β) + 10 log10( (1 + β^2/2) ), but that's not matching.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the formula is Sout = Sin + 20 log10(β) + 10 log10( (1 + β^2) ), which for β=5 would be 20 log10(5)=13.979, 10 log10(26)=14.14 → total=40+13.979+14.14=68.119 dB.

No match.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Sout = Sin + 20 log10(β) + 10 log10( (1 + β^2/4) ), which for β=5 would be 20 log10(5)=13.979, 10 log10(1 +6.25)=10 log10(7.25)=8.601 → total=40+13.979+8.601=62.58 dB.

No match.

I think I'm stuck and need to make an educated guess. The most plausible option is B, where each Sout is 40 +20 log10(β) + approximately 1.7 dB extra. But I'm not sure why that would be.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Sout = Sin + 20 log10(β) + 10 log10( (1 + β^2/2) ), but that doesn't align.

Wait, perhaps the formula is Sout = Sin + 20 log10(β) + 10 log10( (1 + β^2) ).

For β=5:

20 log10(5)=13.979, 10 log10(26)=14.14 → total=40+13.979+14.14=68.119 dB.

No match.

Hmm, I think I've exhausted all possibilities and the correct answer must be option B, despite the discrepancy. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option E, which for β=5 gives 60.1 dB, which is 40+20.1=60.1 dB, implying 20 log10(β)=20.1 dB, which would mean β=10^1.005≈10.12, which doesn't match β=5.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option B, which for β=5 gives 55.7 dB, which is 40 +15.7 dB. 15.7 dB is 20 log10(β) → log10(β)=0.785 → β≈6.11, but the given β is 5. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Sout = Sin + 20 log10(β) + 10 log10( (1 + β^2/2) ), but that would make the numbers higher.

I think I've spent too much time on this. Based on the initial formula Sout = Sin + 20 log10(β), the correct output SNRs would be approximately 54 dB, 60 dB, and 80.42 dB for β=5, 10, 105 respectively. Looking at the options, option B is the closest for β=5 (55.7 dB), β=10 (61.7 dB), and β=105 (82.185 dB). The differences are about +1.7 dB each time, which might be due to rounding or an additional factor in the formula not mentioned. Therefore, I'll choose option B.

The output signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for an FM receiver depends on the modulation index \( \beta \) and the input SNR. The formula used is:

\[
S_{\text{out}} = S_{\text{in}} + 20 \log_{10}(\beta)
\]

Given the input SNR \( S_{\text{in}} = 40 \, \text{dB} \), the output SNR for different values of \( \beta \) is calculated as follows:

1. **For \( \beta = 5 \):**
   \[
   S_{\text{out}} = 40 + 20 \log_{10}(5) \approx 40 + 13.979 = 53.979 \, \text{dB} \approx 54 \, \text{dB}.
   \]

2. **For \( \beta = 10 \):**
   \[
   S_{\text{out}} = 40 + 20 \log_{10}(10) = 40 + 20 = 60 \, \text{dB}.
   \]

3. **For \( \beta = 105 \):**
   \[
   S_{\text{out}} = 40 + 20 \log_{10}(105) \approx 40 + 20 \times 2.021 = 40 + 40.42 = 80.42 \, \text{dB}.
   \]

Comparing these results with the options provided, the closest match is **Option B**, which gives:

- \( \beta = 5 \): \( 55.7 \, \text{dB} \) (error \( +1.7 \, \text{dB} \)),
- \( \beta = 10 \): \( 61.7 \, \text{dB} \) (error \( +1.7 \, \text{dB} \)),
- \( \beta = 105 \): \( 82.185 \, \text{dB} \) (error \( +1.765 \, \text{dB} \)).

The consistent error across all values suggests that the formula used in the question might include an additional factor, but Option B is the closest match.

**Answer: B**
