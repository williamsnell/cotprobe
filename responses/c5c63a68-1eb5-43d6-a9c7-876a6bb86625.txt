Okay, so I've got this problem about finding the voltage across an inductor. Hmm, let me think. I remember from my circuits class that inductors have something to do with voltage and current, but I'm not exactly sure how they relate. Oh right, the formula for the voltage across an inductor is V_L equals L times the derivative of the current with respect to time. So V_L(t) = L * di_L/dt.

The problem gives me the inductance L as 10^-3 henrys. And the current i_L(t) is 0.1 sin(10^6 t). So I need to find the derivative of this current with respect to time.

Wait, how do I take the derivative of a sine function? Oh yeah, the derivative of sin(x) is cos(x), and the derivative of that would be -sin(x), but I just need the first derivative here. So let's compute di_L/dt.

i_L(t) = 0.1 sin(10^6 t)
Taking the derivative, di_L/dt = 0.1 * 10^6 cos(10^6 t), right? Because the derivative of sin(kx) is k cos(kx), where k is 10^6 in this case.

So di_L/dt = 0.1 * 1e6 cos(1e6 t). Let me calculate that. 0.1 times 1e6 is 1e5, so 100,000 cos(1e6 t). Wait, 0.1 * 1e6 is 1e5? No, wait: 0.1 * 1,000,000 is 100,000. Yeah, 1e5 is 100,000.

So then V_L(t) = L * di_L/dt = (10^-3 H) * (1e5 cos(1e6 t)). Let's compute that: 1e-3 times 1e5 is 1e2, which is 100. So V_L(t) is 100 cos(1e6 t).

Looking at the options, option B is 100 cos(10^6 t). So that must be the correct answer.

The voltage across the inductor is found using V_L(t) = L * di_L/dt. The derivative of the given current results in a cosine function with an amplitude of 100. 

Answer: B
