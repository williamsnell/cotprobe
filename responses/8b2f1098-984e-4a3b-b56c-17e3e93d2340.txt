Okay, so I have this statistics problem here, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let me read it carefully.

The question is about dentists studying the fusion of embryonic rat palates using a transplantation technique. Without any treatment, the probability of fusion is about 0.89. They want to estimate p, the probability of fusion, when vitamin A is lacking.

Part (a) asks: How large a sample n of rat embryos is needed for y/n ± 0.10 to be a 95% confidence interval for p?

The options are A to J, with numbers ranging from 25 to 70. I need to choose the correct n.

Hmm, I remember that when estimating the sample size for a proportion, the formula involves the confidence level, the margin of error, and the estimated proportion. So, the formula for the sample size n is:

n = (Z^2 * p * (1-p)) / E^2

Where:
- Z is the Z-score for the desired confidence level.
- p is the estimated proportion from the sample.
- E is the margin of error.

In this case, the confidence level is 95%, so the Z-score should be the one corresponding to 95% confidence. I think that's about 1.96 standard deviations from the mean. Let me confirm that. Yes, for a 95% confidence interval, the Z-score is approximately 1.96.

The margin of error E is given as 0.10. So E = 0.10.

The estimated proportion p is given as 0.89 because that's the probability when no treatment is used. Wait, but the dentists are interested in when vitamin A is lacking. Does that mean p changes? Or is it still 0.89 for their estimate?

I think in the absence of treatment, p is 0.89, and when vitamin A is lacking, they might observe a different p, but since they're estimating p under vitamin A deficiency, they might use 0.89 as their initial estimate. So I'll proceed with p = 0.89.

Now, plugging into the formula:

n = (1.96^2 * 0.89 * (1 - 0.89)) / (0.10)^2

Let me compute each part step by step.

First, 1.96 squared. 1.96 * 1.96 is 3.8416.

Next, 0.89 multiplied by (1 - 0.89) is 0.89 * 0.11. Let me calculate that: 0.89 * 0.11 = 0.0979.

Multiply that by 3.8416: 3.8416 * 0.0979 ≈ Let's see. 3.8416 * 0.1 is 0.38416, but since it's 0.0979, which is slightly less than 0.1, maybe around 0.377.

Wait, let me compute that more accurately:

3.8416 * 0.0979.

Let me break it down:

3 * 0.0979 = 0.2937
0.8416 * 0.0979 ≈ Let me compute 0.8 * 0.0979 = 0.07832, and 0.0416 * 0.0979 ≈ approx 0.00407. So total is approximately 0.07832 + 0.00407 = 0.08239. So 3.8416 * 0.0979 ≈ 0.2937 + 0.08239 ≈ 0.37609.

So numerator is approximately 0.37609.

Denominator is (0.10)^2 = 0.01.

So n ≈ 0.37609 / 0.01 = 37.609.

Since n has to be an integer and you can't have a fraction of a sample, you round up to the next whole number. So 38 is the required sample size.

Looking at the options, G is 38. So the answer should be G.

Wait, but let me double-check because sometimes the formula might use a different approach. Alternatively, if p is unknown, sometimes people use 0.5 as the most conservative estimate, but in this case, they give us p = 0.89, so using that is correct.

Another thing: the formula assumes that np and n(1-p) are both ≥5, but with n=38 and p=0.89, np ≈33.82 and n(1-p)=4.18, which are both above 5. So that's acceptable.

Yes, so n=38 is the correct answer. Looking at the options, G is 38.

To determine the required sample size \( n \) for a 95% confidence interval with a margin of error \( E = 0.10 \) and an estimated proportion \( p = 0.89 \), the formula used is:

\[
n = \frac{Z^2 \cdot p \cdot (1-p)}{E^2}
\]

Where:
- \( Z = 1.96 \) (Z-score for 95% confidence),
- \( p = 0.89 \),
- \( E = 0.10 \).

Plugging in the values:

\[
n = \frac{1.96^2 \cdot 0.89 \cdot (1 - 0.89)}{0.10^2} = \frac{3.8416 \cdot 0.0979}{0.01} \approx 37.609
\]

Rounding up to the next whole number gives \( n = 38 \). This corresponds to option G.
