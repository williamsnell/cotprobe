Okay, so I've got these two motor problems to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through them step by step. Let's take the first question first.

Problem 1:
The terminal voltage is 240 volts, armature current is 60 amps, armature resistance is 0.08 ohms, and the counter EMF is 235.2 volts. I need to find the power developed by the motor in watts and horsepower.

Hmm, I remember that the power developed by a motor can be calculated using the formula P = V * I, but wait, is that correct? Oh right, because the terminal voltage is the voltage across the motor, and I is the current through it, so yes, P = V * I would give the power input, but wait, isn't that the input power? Or is it the output power?

Wait, no, actually, the power developed by the motor is the output power. But wait, the formula P = V * I gives the electrical power input. To find the mechanical output, I think I need to subtract the losses. Oh right, because some of the power is lost as heat due to the armature resistance.

So the input power is V * I, which is 240V * 60A. Let me calculate that: 240 * 60 = 14,400 watts. So that's 14.4 kilowatts.

But then, the motor also has losses. The losses are the power dissipated in the armature resistance, which is I² * R. So I is 60A, R is 0.08 ohms. So 60^2 = 3,600. Multiply by 0.08: 3,600 * 0.08 = 288 watts. So the losses are 288 watts.

So the mechanical power output would be the input power minus the losses: 14,400 - 288 = 14,112 watts. So part (a) is 14,112 watts.

Now part (b) is to convert this to horsepower. I remember that 1 horsepower is approximately 745.7 watts. So I'll divide 14,112 by 745.7 to get horsepower.

Let me compute that: 14,112 ÷ 745.7. Let me see, 745.7 * 18 is roughly 13,422.6, because 700*18=12,600, 45.7*18=822.6, so total 13,422.6. Hmm, that's less than 14,112. Let me try 18.9 HP: 745.7 * 18.9 = ?

Wait, maybe a better way is to compute 14,112 ÷ 745.7. Let me approximate:

745.7 * 18 = 13,422.6

14,112 - 13,422.6 = 689.4

Now, 689.4 ÷ 745.7 ≈ 0.925. So total HP is 18.925, which rounds to about 18.92 hp. Looking at the options, option I has 18.92 hp for part (b). So part (b) is approximately 18.92 hp.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation of 14,112 ÷ 745.7. Let me do it more accurately.

Divide 14,112 by 745.7:

745.7 * 19 = 14,168.3, which is a bit higher than 14,112. So 19 hp would be 14,168.3, which is 56.3 more than 14,112. So 19 - (56.3/745.7 per hp) ≈ 19 - 0.0756 ≈ 18.924 hp. So yes, 18.92 hp.

So part (a) is 14,112 watts, part (b) is 18.92 hp.

Now moving on to Problem 2:

The motor's speed is 1,100 rpm. The net force from the prony brake is 16 lb, and the brake arm is 28 inches. Need to find the horsepower output.

I think the prony brake measures torque, which is force times radius (distance from the center). So torque T = F * r. But wait, the units need to be consistent. The force is in pounds, and the radius is in inches, but I might need to convert to feet because horsepower typically uses foot-pounds per minute.

Wait, let me think. Torque in foot-pounds would be force in pounds multiplied by distance in feet. So 28 inches is 28/12 feet, which is approximately 2.3333 feet.

So torque T = 16 lb * (28/12) ft. Let me compute that: 28/12 = 2.333... So 16 * 2.3333 ≈ 37.333 lb-ft.

Now, power is torque multiplied by angular velocity. Angular velocity in radians per second. But since the motor speed is given in rpm, I can use the formula:

Power (hp) = (Torque (lb-ft) * Speed (rpm)) / (5252.115)

Because 5252.115 is the conversion factor from (lb-ft * rpm) to horsepower.

So let me plug in the numbers:

Torque T = 37.333 lb-ft

Speed N = 1,100 rpm

Power P = (37.333 * 1100) / 5252.115

Calculate numerator: 37.333 * 1100 = ?

Well, 37 * 1100 = 40,700, and 0.333 * 1100 ≈ 366.666. So total ≈ 40,700 + 366.666 ≈ 41,066.666.

Now divide by 5252.115: 41,066.666 / 5252.115 ≈ let's compute that.

Well, 5252 * 7.8 = let's see: 5252 *7 = 36,764; 5252 *0.8 = 4,201.6 → total 40,965.6. Hmm, that's close to 41,066.666.

The difference is 41,066.666 - 40,965.6 = 101.066.

So 101.066 / 5252 ≈ 0.01927. So total horsepower is approximately 7.8 + 0.01927 ≈ 7.819 hp.

Looking at the options, let's see which option has 7.82 hp for part (c). Option I has 7.82 hp.

Wait, let me check the options again. Option I: part (c) is 7.82 hp. So that's the correct answer.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Let me recalculate the torque:

Torque T = 16 lb * (28 in) = 448 lb-in. Oh wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Because in the prony brake, the torque is force multiplied by the length of the brake arm, but in the same units. So 16 lb * 28 inches = 448 lb-in. But to convert to lb-ft, I divide by 12, so 448 /12 ≈ 37.333 lb-ft. So that part was correct.

Then, power P = (37.333 lb-ft * 1100 rpm) / 5252.115.

37.333 * 1100 = 41,066.3 lb-ft rpm.

Divide by 5252.115: 41,066.3 /5252.115 ≈ 7.819 hp, which is approximately 7.82 hp.

So for problem 2, the horsepower is 7.82 hp.

Now, looking back at the options for the two parts:

Problem 1(a): 14,112 watts → which matches option I.

Problem 1(b): 18.92 hp → option I.

Problem 2: 7.82 hp → option I.

So the correct option is I.
