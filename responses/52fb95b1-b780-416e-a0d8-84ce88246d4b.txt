Question:

A car tyre (i.e. an automobile tire) was inflated to a pressure of $24 \mathrm{lb} \mathrm{in}^{-2}$ $(1.00 \mathrm{atm}=14.7 \mathrm{lb} \mathrm{in}^{-2})$ on a winter's day when the temperature was $-5^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. What pressure will be found, assuming no leaks have occurred and that the volume is constant, on a subsequent summer's day when the temperature is $35^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$?

Options:

A: 35$\mathrm{lb} \mathrm{in}^{-2}$
B: 32$\mathrm{lb} \mathrm{in}^{-2}$
C: 26$\mathrm{lb} \mathrm{in}^{-2}$
D: 30$\mathrm{lb} \mathrm{in}^{-2}$
E: 28$\mathrm{lb} \mathrm{in}^{-2}$
F: 29$\mathrm{lb} \mathrm{in}^{-2}$

Okay, so I've got this problem about a car tyre pressure changing with temperature. Hmm, I remember that gases expand when heated, so the pressure should increase when the temperature goes up. But wait, I think there's a specific law for this—probably Charles's Law or Gay-Lussac's Law. Oh right, Gay-Lussac's Law deals with pressure and temperature when volume is constant. So the formula should be P1/T1 = P2/T2.

Wait, but temperature has to be in Kelvin for these gas laws. Right, so I need to convert the Celsius temperatures to Kelvin. The formula is K = °C + 273.15. So the initial temperature is -5°C, which is 268.15 K. The final temperature is 35°C, so that's 308.15 K.

The initial pressure P1 is 24 lb/in². I need to find P2 when the temperature rises. So rearranging the formula: P2 = P1 * (T2/T1).

Plugging in the numbers: P2 = 24 * (308.15 / 268.15). Let me calculate that. 308.15 divided by 268.15 is approximately 1.149. Multiply that by 24: 24 * 1.149 ≈ 27.58 lb/in². Hmm, looking at the options, the closest is 27 lb/in², which is option G. But wait, let me double-check my calculations because sometimes these approximations can be tricky.

Alternatively, maybe I should compute the division more accurately. 308.15 / 268.15: Let me do that. 268.15 goes into 308.15 how many times? Approximately 1.149, as before. 24 times 1.149 is indeed around 27.576. Oh wait, the options don't have 27.58. The closest is G:27, but there's also F:29, H:31. Did I do something wrong?

Wait, let me think again. Oh no! Wait, the initial pressure is 24 lb/in², which is given as 1.00 atm because 1 atm is 14.7 lb/in². Wait, wait! The initial pressure was 24 lb/in², but the question says that 1 atm is 14.7 lb/in². Wait, so 24 lb/in² is more than 1 atm. So 24 /14.7 is about 1.63 atm? But wait, in the problem, when they say it's inflated to 24 lb/in² on a winter day. So I think I don't need to convert it to atm for the calculation because the gas law uses absolute pressure, but I'm not sure if units matter here. Oh wait, because we're using ratios, the actual units will cancel out as long as they're consistent. So maybe I don't need to convert to atm; the pressure in lb/in² can be used directly.

Wait, but I used the initial pressure correctly as 24 lb/in². So the calculation should be correct. So 24 * (308.15/268.15) = 24 * 1.149 ≈ 27.58 lb/in². The options don't have 27.58. The closest is G:27 or F:29. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the temperature calculation? Let me check the temperatures again.

Wait, -5°C is 268.15 K, and 35°C is 308.15 K. That's correct. So 308.15 /268.15 = 1.149. 24 *1.149 is 27.576. So the pressure should be approximately 27.58 lb/in². The options are A to J, and G is 27, F is 29. So 27.58 is closer to 28. Oh wait, maybe I should round it up to 28. Let me see. 27.58 is 27.6, which would be closer to 28 than 27. But option E is 28. Wait, the options are E:28, F:29, G:27. So if I round 27.6 to the nearest whole number, it's 28, so E would be the answer. But wait, my initial calculation gave me 27.58, which is almost 27.6, which is 28 when rounded up. But wait, looking back at the options, E is 28. So that would be the correct choice. But wait, the options don't have 27.6, so the closest is either 27 or 28. Since 27.58 is very close to 27.6, which is almost 28, so E would be the answer. But wait, the initial options don't have E as 28. Wait, looking back: The options are A:35, B:32, C:26, D:30, E:28, F:29, G:27, H:31, I:33, J:34. So E is 28, which is the closest to my calculated value of 27.58. So the correct answer should be E:28 lb/in².

Wait, but earlier I thought it was 27.58, which is between 27 and 28. So perhaps the answer is E:28. But wait, maybe I should check if I made a mistake in the formula. Oh wait, the formula is P1/T1 = P2/T2 because volume is constant. So P2 = P1*(T2/T1). So that's correct.

Wait another thing: Maybe the initial pressure is given as 24 lb/in², which is 24 psi. Since 1 atm is 14.7 psi, 24 psi is about 1.63 atm. But when using the formula, the actual pressure units don't matter as long as they're consistent. So I think the calculation is right.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects using the ideal gas law, but since volume is constant, n and R are constant, so P is proportional to T, hence P1/T1 = P2/T2. So my approach is correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the ratio. Let me recalculate 308.15 /268.15.

Let me compute it more accurately:

308.15 ÷ 268.15.

Let me see: 268.15 * 1.14 = 268.15 *1 + 268.15 *0.14 = 268.15 + 37.541 = 305.691. That's close to 308.15.

The difference is 308.15 - 305.691 = 2.459.

So how much more is that? 2.459 ÷ 268.15 ≈ 0.00917.

So 1.14 + 0.00917 ≈ 1.14917.

So 1.14917 is the ratio.

So P2 =24 *1.14917 = let's compute that.

24 *1 =24.

24 *0.14917= 24 *0.1=2.4, 24*0.04917≈1.180.

So total is 24 +2.4 +1.180=27.58.

So 27.58 lb/in². Looking at the options, E is 28, which is the closest. So the correct answer should be E:28 lb/in².

Wait, but the options don't have G as 27 and E as 28. So I think the answer is E:28. Alternatively, perhaps I should check if the problem expects using Celsius instead of Kelvin, which would be a mistake, but let's see. If someone mistakenly uses Celsius, then the ratio would be (35 - 5)/ (273 +5) or something. Wait, no, the formula requires absolute temperatures in Kelvin.

Wait, let's see what would happen if someone used the temperatures in Celsius without converting to Kelvin. So T1 = -5°C, T2=35°C. So the ratio would be (35 - (-5)) / (35 + 273.15) ? No, that's not correct. Because the formula uses absolute temperatures. So using Celsius directly would be wrong. But perhaps someone might mistakenly do T2 + T1, but that's not correct.

So the correct approach is using Kelvin, which gives us 27.58, so the answer is E:28. But I'm a bit confused because the initial calculation was 27.58, which is very close to 28. So the correct choice is E.

To solve the problem, we use Gay-Lussac's Law, which states that pressure is directly proportional to temperature when volume is constant. The formula is:

\[
\frac{P_1}{T_1} = \frac{P_2}{T_2}
\]

### Step 1: Convert Temperatures to Kelvin
The initial temperature is \(-5^\circ \mathrm{C}\), and the final temperature is \(35^\circ \mathrm{C}\). Converting to Kelvin:

\[
T_1 = -5 + 273.15 = 268.15 \, \mathrm{K}
\]
\[
T_2 = 35 + 273.15 = 308.15 \, \mathrm{K}
\]

### Step 2: Apply Gay-Lussac's Law
Rearranging the formula to solve for \(P_2\):

\[
P_2 = P_1 \cdot \frac{T_2}{T_1}
\]

Substituting the known values:

\[
P_2 = 24 \cdot \frac{308.15}{268.15}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the Ratio
\[
\frac{308.15}{268.15} \approx 1.149
\]

\[
P_2 = 24 \cdot 1.149 \approx 27.58 \, \mathrm{lb} \, \mathrm{in}^{-2}
\]

### Step 4: Round to the Nearest Option
The calculated pressure is approximately \(27.58 \, \mathrm{lb} \, \mathrm{in}^{-2}\). Among the given options, the closest value is:

**E: 28 \(\mathrm{lb} \, \mathrm{in}^{-2}\)**

### Final Answer:
The pressure on the summer day will be **28 \(\mathrm{lb} \, \mathrm{in}^{-2}\)**.
