Okay, let's try to figure out the answer to this question. So, the question is about estimating the distance between the lowest and highest points on Earth. The lowest point is the bottom of the Mariana Trench, which is 35,840 feet below sea level. The highest point is the summit of Mount Everest, which is 29,028 feet above sea level. I need to find the best estimate of the distance between these two points.

Hmm, so I think I should start by understanding what exactly is being asked. The distance between these two points would be the sum of the depth of the Mariana Trench and the height of Mount Everest because one is below sea level and the other is above. So, I need to add these two numbers together.

Let me write down the numbers to make it clearer. The Mariana Trench is 35,840 feet deep, and Mount Everest is 29,028 feet high. So, adding them together: 35,840 + 29,028. Let me do the addition step by step.

First, add the thousands: 35,000 + 29,000. That would be 64,000 feet. Then, add the remaining parts: 840 + 28. That's 868 feet. So, adding those together, 64,000 + 868 equals 64,868 feet.

Now, looking at the options provided: A is 75,000, B is 65,000, C is 55,000, D is 60,000, E is 7,000, F is 64,000, G is 70,000, H is 50,000, I is 6,000, and J is 80,000. My calculated total is 64,868 feet, which is approximately 64,900 feet. So, the closest option to this number is F: 64,000 feet.

Wait, but let me double-check my addition to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 35,840 plus 29,028. Let's add them another way. 35,840 + 20,000 is 55,840. Then add 9,000: 55,840 + 9,000 = 64,840. Then add 28: 64,840 + 28 = 64,868. Yep, that's correct.

So, the exact distance is 64,868 feet, which is very close to 64,000 feet. Among the options, F is 64,000, which is the best estimate. The other options are either much lower or higher. For example, A is way higher, and J is even higher, so those are out. D is 60,000, which is a bit lower than 64,000, but F is a better fit because it's closer.

I think I'm confident with this answer. The distance is approximately 64,000 feet.
