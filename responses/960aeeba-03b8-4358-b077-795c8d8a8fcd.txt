Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the velocity and acceleration of a fluid particle given some equations for x, y, and z in terms of x0, y0, z0, and time t. The given values are x0=1 cm, y0=2 cm, z0=3 cm, and t=2. The options are A through J, each giving specific values for velocity and acceleration vectors.

First, I think I need to find the velocity components by differentiating each of the position equations with respect to time. Velocity is the first derivative of position, and acceleration is the second derivative.

Looking at the given equations:

x = (3x0 y0 t²)/z0
y = (5x0 z0 t)/y0
z = (2y0 z0 t³)/x0

I should substitute the given values into these equations first to find x, y, z at t=2, but wait, no, actually, velocity is the derivative of position with respect to time. So I need to differentiate x, y, z each with respect to t.

Let's start with x. The equation is x = (3x0 y0 t²)/z0. Since x0, y0, z0 are constants (they are given at t=2), the derivative of x with respect to t, which is vx, should be the derivative of (3x0 y0 t²)/z0. 

So, dx/dt = (3x0 y0) * 2t / z0 = (6x0 y0 t)/z0. 

Similarly, for y: dy/dt = (5x0 z0)/y0 * 1 (since derivative of t is 1) = (5x0 z0)/y0.

For z: dz/dt = derivative of (2y0 z0 t³)/x0. So, 2y0 z0/x0 * 3t² = (6y0 z0 t²)/x0.

Wait, but I'm not sure if these are correct. Let me double-check: yes, velocity components are the derivatives. So, vx = (6x0 y0 t)/z0, vy = (5x0 z0)/y0, vz = (6y0 z0 t²)/x0.

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake with vy. Let me see: the equation for y is (5x0 z0 t)/y0. So the derivative is (5x0 z0)/y0, correct, since t's derivative is 1.

Now, plug in the given values: x0=1 cm, y0=2 cm, z0=3 cm, and t=2.

Calculating each component:

vx = (6 * 1 * 2 * 2) / 3 = (6 * 4) / 3 = 24/3 = 8 cm/s.

vy = (5 * 1 * 3) / 2 = 15/2 = 7.5 cm/s.

vz = (6 * 2 * 3 * (2)^2) / 1 = 6 * 2 * 3 *4 = 6*24=144 cm/s.

Wait, that would make the velocity vector (8i + 7.5j +144k). Let me check the options. Looking at option B: V =8i +7.5j +144k. So that's the velocity.

Now, acceleration is the derivative of velocity with respect to time. So, I need to find the second derivatives of x, y, z.

Looking at vx: (6x0 y0 t)/z0. The derivative of this with respect to t is (6x0 y0)/z0. So, ax = (6 *1 *2)/3 = 12/3=4 cm/s².

vy: (5x0 z0)/y0 is constant with respect to t, so its derivative is zero. So, ay=0.

vz: (6y0 z0 t²)/x0. The derivative of this with respect to t is (12 y0 z0 t)/x0. Plugging in t=2: (12 *2 *3 *2)/1 = 12*12=144 cm/s². Wait, but wait: 12 *2 is 24, 24 *3 is 72, 72 *2 is 144? Let me compute: 12 * 2=24, then 24 *3=72, 72 *2=144. Yes.

Wait, but looking at the options, some have different acceleration values. Let me check option B: a=4i +144k. That seems correct.

Wait, but in the given options, option B says a=4i +144k. Let me see: So velocity is 8i +7.5j +144k, and acceleration is 4i +144k. That matches option B. So the answer should be option B.

To determine the velocity and acceleration, we first compute the derivatives of the position equations with respect to time.

For velocity:
- \( v_x = \frac{dx}{dt} = \frac{6x_0 y_0 t}{z_0} = \frac{6(1)(2)(2)}{3} = 8 \, \text{cm/s} \)
- \( v_y = \frac{dy}{dt} = \frac{5x_0 z_0}{y_0} = \frac{5(1)(3)}{2} = 7.5 \, \text{cm/s} \)
- \( v_z = \frac{dz}{dt} = \frac{6y_0 z_0 t^2}{x_0} = \frac{6(2)(3)(2^2)}{1} = 144 \, \text{cm/s} \)

For acceleration:
- \( a_x = \frac{dv_x}{dt} = \frac{6x_0 y_0}{z_0} = \frac{6(1)(2)}{3} = 4 \, \text{cm/s}^2 \)
- \( a_y = \frac{dv_y}{dt} = 0 \) (since \( v_y \) is constant)
- \( a_z = \frac{dv_z}{dt} = \frac{12y_0 z_0 t}{x_0} = \frac{12(2)(3)(2)}{1} = 144 \, \text{cm/s}^2 \)

Thus, the velocity is \( 8\mathbf{i} + 7.5\mathbf{j} + 144\mathbf{k} \) and the acceleration is \( 4\mathbf{i} + 144\mathbf{k} \), matching option B.
