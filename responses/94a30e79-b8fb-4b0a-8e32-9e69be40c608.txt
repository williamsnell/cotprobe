Okay, so I've got this question about calculating the interest for three different loans. I'm a bit rusty on my finance, but I'll try to work through each one step by step.

First, let's break down the problem. There are three loans given by Mr. Bancroft, each with different amounts, interest rates, and periods. I need to calculate the interest each person has to pay.

I remember that interest can be calculated using simple interest formula, which is I = P * R * T. P is the principal amount, R is the annual interest rate (in decimal form), and T is the time in years. Wait, but some of these loans are for less than a year, so I need to make sure to convert the time into years correctly.

Let's tackle each loan one by one.

1. **Ms. Atlas's Loan:**
   - Principal (P) = $1,800
   - Rate (R) = 6% annually
   - Time (T) = 60 days

Hmm, 60 days is less than a year. Since there are 365 days in a year, 60/365 is the time in years. But wait, sometimes people approximate a year as 360 days for simplicity, especially in finance. I'm not sure which one to use here. Let me think. The problem doesn't specify, so maybe I should use 365 days.

So T = 60/365 ≈ 0.1644 years.

R is 6%, which is 0.06 in decimal.

Now, calculate I = 1800 * 0.06 * (60/365).

Let me compute that:

1800 * 0.06 = 108. Then, 108 * (60/365) ≈ 108 * 0.1644 ≈ 17.77. So approximately $17.77. Looking at the options, I see that option I has Ms. Atlas paying $18, which is close. But wait, maybe they used 360 days instead. Let's check that.

If T is 60/360 = 0.1667 years.

Then I = 1800 * 0.06 * (1/6) [since 60/360 is 1/6].

1800 * 0.06 = 108, multiplied by 1/6 is 18. So exactly $18. That would match option I for Ms. Atlas. Hmm, but let me check other options too.

2. **Mr. Johnson's Loan:**
   - Principal (P) = $2,400
   - Rate (R) = 5% annually
   - Time (T) = 3 years

This one is straightforward since the time is in years already.

I = 2400 * 0.05 * 3.

2400 * 0.05 = 120. 120 *3 = 360. So interest is $360.

Looking at the options, which one has Mr. Johnson paying $360? Let's see. Option I has Mr. Johnson at $360. That matches.

3. **Mr. Breakman's Loan:**
   - Principal (P) = $7,000
   - Rate (R) = 6.5% annually
   - Time (T) = 4 years

Again, simple interest.

I = 7000 * 0.065 *4.

7000 * 0.065 = 455. Then, 455 *4 = 1820. So interest is $1,820.

Now, looking at the options, which option has Ms. Atlas at $18, Mr. Johnson at $360, and Mr. Breakman at $1,820? That's option I.

The correct answer is option I because each loan's interest was calculated correctly using the simple interest formula, considering the appropriate time conversion and interest rates.
