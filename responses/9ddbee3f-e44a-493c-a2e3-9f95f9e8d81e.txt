Okay, so I've got this integral to compute over an ellipsoid, and honestly, I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with surface integrals, especially vector fields. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The integral is ∬_Σ x³ dy dz + y³ dz dx + z³ dx dy, where Σ is the outward surface of the ellipsoid x² + y² + z²/4 = 1. Hmm, that's the equation of an ellipsoid, right? Because it's x² + y² + (z²)/(2²) = 1. So it's stretched along the z-axis.

I remember that for surface integrals of vector fields, we can use the divergence theorem if the surface is closed and the field is nice enough (which it probably is here). Wait, but does the divergence theorem apply here? The divergence theorem relates a flux integral to a triple integral of the divergence over the volume enclosed by the surface. So the integral over the ellipsoid's surface would be equal to the triple integral of the divergence of the vector field over the volume inside.

So first, let's find the divergence of the vector field F. The vector field is given by F = (x³, y³, z³), because the integral is ∫∫ F · dS, where F has components F_yz = x³, F_zx = y³, F_xy = z³. Wait, no, maybe I should write it as F = (P, Q, R) where P = x³, Q = y³, R = z³. Then the divergence is ∂P/∂x + ∂Q/∂y + ∂R/∂z.

Calculating each partial derivative:
∂P/∂x = 3x²
∂Q/∂y = 3y²
∂R/∂z = 3z²
So divergence div F = 3x² + 3y² + 3z² = 3(x² + y² + z²)

Hmm, that's neat. So the integral over the surface becomes the triple integral over the volume of 3(x² + y² + z²) dV.

So the flux integral is equal to 3 times the triple integral of (x² + y² + z²) over the ellipsoid.

Now, the next step is to compute this triple integral. The ellipsoid is x² + y² + z²/4 =1, which can be rewritten as (x²)/(1²) + (y²)/(1²) + (z²)/(2²) =1. So it's an ellipsoid with semi-axes lengths 1, 1, and 2.

I think it's easier to switch to spherical coordinates or maybe use a scaling transformation to make the ellipsoid into a unit sphere. Let me consider a substitution.

Let me define variables u = x, v = y, w = z/2. Then, the ellipsoid equation becomes u² + v² + w² = 1, which is the unit sphere. The Jacobian determinant for this substitution is |∂(x,y,z)/∂(u,v,w)|. Let's compute that:

x = u, y = v, z = 2w. So the Jacobian matrix is diagonal with entries 1, 1, 2. So the determinant is 1*1*2 = 2. Therefore, dV = dx dy dz = 2 du dv dw.

Now, the triple integral over the ellipsoid becomes the integral over the unit sphere in uvw-space multiplied by 2.

But what about the integrand? The integrand is 3(x² + y² + z²) = 3(u² + v² + (2w)^2) = 3(u² + v² +4w²).

Wait, no, because z = 2w, so z² = (2w)^2 =4w². So the integrand becomes 3(u² + v² +4w²).

So putting it all together, the triple integral becomes:

∫∫∫_{u² + v² + w² ≤1} 3(u² + v² +4w²) * 2 du dv dw.

Which simplifies to 6 ∫∫∫ (u² + v² +4w²) du dv dw over the unit sphere.

Wait, no, because 3*(u² +v² +4w²) multiplied by 2 gives 6*(u² +v² +4w²).

So now, I need to compute ∫∫∫_{unit sphere} (u² + v² +4w²) du dv dw. Hmm, but maybe I can exploit symmetry here.

In spherical coordinates, u² + v² + w² = r², and the integral over the unit sphere can be simplified. Let's think about it.

The integral of u² over the unit sphere is the same as the integral of v² and the same as w², due to symmetry. But wait, no, because the substitution changed the weight on w. Wait, in this case, we're integrating (u² + v² +4w²), so the coefficients are different. So I can't just say each term is the same. Let's see.

Wait, but in spherical coordinates, u, v, w are symmetric, but with the integrand having different coefficients. Hmm, maybe it's easier to compute each term separately.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute the integral over the unit sphere of u², v², and w² separately, then multiply by their coefficients and sum.

So let's compute I1 = ∫∫∫_{unit sphere} u² du dv dw, I2 = ∫∫∫ v² du dv dw, and I3 = ∫∫∫ w² du dv dw.

But due to symmetry, I1 = I2, and I3 might be different because in the substitution, w is scaled differently, but in the unit sphere, w is treated symmetrically. Wait, no, because in our substitution, the ellipsoid is transformed into a unit sphere, so in the uvw coordinates, the sphere is symmetric. So I1 = I2 = I3, right? Because u, v, w are all symmetric in the unit sphere. So each of u², v², w² will have the same integral over the unit sphere.

Wait, but the integrand is (u² + v² +4w²), which is not symmetric in w. So I can't directly say that I1 = I2 = I3. Instead, I have to compute each term as follows.

Wait, maybe I can compute the average value of u², v², and w² over the unit sphere. I remember that for a unit sphere, the average value of r² in spherical coordinates is 2/3, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the integral of u² over the unit sphere.

Wait, but let me think again. The integral of u² over the unit sphere in 3D can be found using spherical coordinates. Let me set up the integral.

In spherical coordinates, u = r sinθ cosφ, v = r sinθ sinφ, w = r cosθ. The volume element is r² sinθ dr dθ dφ, with r from 0 to 1, θ from 0 to π, φ from 0 to 2π.

So the integral I1 = ∫∫∫ u² du dv dw becomes ∫ (r sinθ cosφ)^2 * r² sinθ dr dθ dφ.

Expanding, I1 = ∫ (r² sin²θ cos²φ) * r² sinθ dr dθ dφ = ∫ r^4 sin^3θ cos^2φ dr dθ dφ.

Similarly, the integral I2 = ∫∫∫ v² du dv dw would be the same as I1 because v is just another spherical coordinate, so I2 = I1.

As for I3, the integral of w² over the unit sphere is ∫∫∫ (r cosθ)^2 * r² sinθ dr dθ dφ = ∫ r^4 cos^2θ sinθ dr dθ dφ.

So, the integrals I1 and I3 are different due to the cos^2φ and cos^2θ terms, but let me compute each.

First, compute I1:

I1 = ∫ (r=0 to 1) r^4 dr ∫ (θ=0 to π) sin^3θ dθ ∫ (φ=0 to 2π) cos^2φ dφ.

Compute each integral separately.

Integrate over r: ∫0^1 r^4 dr = [r^5/5] from 0 to1 = 1/5.

Integrate over θ: ∫0^π sin^3θ dθ. Let me compute this. I know that ∫0^π sin^nθ dθ = 2 ∫0^{π/2} sin^nθ dθ. For n=3, it's 2*(2/3) )= 4/3. Wait, no, let me compute it correctly.

Wait, ∫ sin^3θ dθ from 0 to π is 2 ∫0^{π/2} sin^3θ dθ. The integral of sin^3θ dθ is ∫ sin^3θ dθ = ∫ (1 - cos^2θ) sinθ dθ = -cosθ + (cos^3θ)/3 + C. Evaluated from 0 to π/2, it's [ -cos(π/2) + (cos^3(π/2))/3 ] - [ -cos(0) + (cos^3(0))/3 ] = [0 + 0] - [ -1 + (1)/3 ] = 1 - 1/3 = 2/3. So times 2 is 4/3.

Integrate over φ: ∫0^{2π} cos^2φ dφ. The integral of cos^2φ dφ over 0 to 2π is π, because ∫ cos^2φ dφ = (φ/2 + (sin(2φ))/4) evaluated from 0 to 2π, which gives π.

So I1 = (1/5) * (4/3) * π = (4π)/(15).

Similarly, I2 is the same as I1, because v² is symmetric to u².

Now, I3 = ∫∫∫ w² du dv dw. Let's compute this.

I3 = ∫0^1 r^4 dr ∫0^π cos^2θ sinθ dθ ∫0^{2π} dφ.

Compute each part:

Integrate over r: same as before, 1/5.

Integrate over θ: ∫0^π cos^2θ sinθ dθ. Let me make substitution u = cosθ, du = -sinθ dθ. So the integral becomes ∫u^2 (-du) from u=1 to u=-1, which is ∫ from -1 to 1 u^2 du = [u^3/3] from -1 to1 = (1/3) - (-1/3) )= 2/3.

Integrate over φ: ∫0^{2π} dφ = 2π.

So I3 = (1/5) * (2/3) * 2π = (4π)/(15).

Wait, that's interesting. So I3 is (4π/15), same as I1 and I2. But wait, that can't be right because the integrand in I3 was w², which is scaled differently, but in the unit sphere, the substitution has already accounted for that scaling.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Because when we did the substitution, z = 2w, so when we transformed to u, v, w, the Jacobian was 2, and the integrand became 3(u² +v² +4w²). So when we compute the triple integral over u, v, w, it's 3*(u² +v² +4w²) * 2 dV.

Wait, but in the transformed variables, the integrand is 3*(u² +v² +4w²), and the volume element is 2 du dv dw.

So the triple integral becomes 6 ∫∫∫ (u² +v² +4w²) du dv dw.

So back to computing ∫∫∫ (u² +v² +4w²) du dv dw.

Which is equal to ∫∫∫ u² du dv dw + ∫∫∫ v² du dv dw +4 ∫∫∫ w² du dv dw.

We have:

I1 = ∫∫∫ u² du dv dw = 4π/15.

I2 = ∫∫∫ v² du dv dw =4π/15.

I3 = ∫∫∫ w² du dv dw=4π/15.

So the total integral is I1 + I2 +4I3 = (4π/15) + (4π/15) +4*(4π/15) = (8π/15) + (16π/15) =24π/15 =8π/5.

Wait, let me check that again.

I1 + I2 = 4π/15 +4π/15 =8π/15.

4I3=4*(4π/15)=16π/15.

Adding them together:8π/15 +16π/15=24π/15=8π/5.

So the triple integral ∫∫∫ (u² +v² +4w²) du dv dw =8π/5.

Then, the original integral is 6 times this, so 6*(8π/5)=48π/5.

Wait, but wait, no. Let me retrace.

Wait, earlier I set the triple integral as 6 ∫∫∫ (u² +v² +4w²) du dv dw, because the integrand was 3*(u² +v² +4w²) and the Jacobian gave us a factor of 2, so 3*2=6.

So the triple integral part is 6*(8π/5) =48π/5.

Wait, but wait, no. Because the integral we computed was ∫∫∫ (u² +v² +4w²) du dv dw =8π/5.

So 6*(8π/5) =48π/5.

But wait, the flux integral is 3 times the triple integral of (x² + y² + z²) dV, which in terms of the substitution became 3*(u² +v² +4w²) *2 du dv dw, so 6*(u² +v² +4w²) du dv dw.

Wait, no, the divergence was 3(x² + y² + z²) which in terms of u, v, w is 3(u² +v² +4w²). So the triple integral is ∫∫∫ 3(u² +v² +4w²) *2 du dv dw =6 ∫∫∫ (u² +v² +4w²) du dv dw, which we found to be 6*(8π/5)=48π/5.

So the flux integral is 48π/5.

Wait, but 48π/5 is approximately 48*3.14159265/5 ≈48*0.62831853 ≈30.15928944.

Looking at the options, option C is 30.15928896, which is very close. So the answer should be option C.

To compute the integral ∬_Σ x³ dy dz + y³ dz dx + z³ dx dy over the outward surface of the ellipsoid x² + y² + z²/4 = 1, we use the divergence theorem. The divergence of the vector field F = (x³, y³, z³) is 3(x² + y² + z²). The integral becomes the triple integral of 3(x² + y² + z²) over the volume inside the ellipsoid.

Using a substitution (u = x, v = y, w = z/2), the ellipsoid transforms to a unit sphere. The Jacobian determinant is 2, and the integrand becomes 3(u² + v² + 4w²). The triple integral over the unit sphere is computed using spherical coordinates, yielding 8π/5. Multiplying by 6 (from the Jacobian and divergence factor), the result is 48π/5 ≈ 30.15928944. The closest option is C.
