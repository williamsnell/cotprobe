Okay, so I've got this question about the simplest alkene. Hmm, let's see. I remember that alkenes are hydrocarbons with at least one carbon-carbon double bond. The simplest alkene would be ethene, right? Because ethene is the simplest with two carbons.

Wait, the question is asking about the characteristics of the simplest alkene. Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: cis-trans isomers. Oh, right, cis-trans isomerism occurs when there are two different groups attached to each carbon in the double bond. But ethene has two identical groups on each carbon—each is a hydrogen. So, ethene can't have cis-trans isomers. So A is not correct.

Option B: at least four sigma bonds. Let me think. Each carbon in ethene has three sigma bonds. Each C has two H's and one double bond. The double bond is one sigma and one pi. So each C has three sigma bonds. So in total, ethene has 3 (from one C) + 3 (from the other C) = 6 sigma bonds. So six sigma bonds, which is more than four. So B says at least four, which is true. So B is a possible correct answer.

Option C: no sigma bonds. No, that's wrong because every single bond is a sigma bond. The double bond has one sigma and one pi. So definitely, there are sigma bonds. So C is wrong.

Option D: a trigonal planar configuration. Wait, ethene has a trigonal planar geometry around each carbon in the double bond. Yeah, each carbon in the double bond is trigonal planar because of the three regions of electron density (one sigma, two pi). So D could be correct.

Option E: a tetrahedral configuration. No, that's for single bonds. The double bond restricts the geometry to trigonal planar, not tetrahedral. So E is wrong.

Option F: at least two pi bonds. Wait, a double bond has one sigma and one pi. So ethene has only one pi bond. So F is incorrect because it says at least two.

Option G: at least two pi bonds. Same as F, it's wrong because there's only one pi bond in ethene.

Option H: aromatic properties. Aromatic compounds are cyclic, planar, with conjugated double bonds and follow Huckel's rule. Ethene isn't aromatic; it's just a simple alkene. So H is wrong.

Option I: at least six sigma bonds. Let's count. Each C has three sigma bonds. So two Cs make 3+3=6 sigma bonds. So yes, ethene has six sigma bonds. So I is correct.

Wait, the question is asking for the simplest alkene. So which options are correct? Let's see the options again.

The question says "the simplest alkene has". So which of these are correct.

Looking at the options, let's see:

- B says at least four sigma bonds. Ethene has six, so yes, this is true.

- D says a trigonal planar configuration. Each carbon is trigonal planar, so that's correct.

- I says at least six sigma bonds. Since it has exactly six, this is correct.

Wait, but let me check each option again.

Option B: At least four sigma bonds. Ethene has six, so yes, correct.

Option D: Trigonal planar. Correct.

Option I: At least six sigma bonds. Correct.

Wait, but the question is a multiple-choice, and the options are from A to I. So the correct options must be those that apply to ethene.

Wait, the question is looking for which statement is correct about the simplest alkene. So which of these options are true.

Looking back:

- B: at least four sigma bonds. True.

- D: trigonal planar. True.

- I: at least six sigma bonds. True.

Wait, but the options are each a separate statement. So the correct answer would be the one that is true about the simplest alkene, ethene.

So which of the options is correct. Let's see all:

Looking at the options again:

A: cis-trans isomers. No.

B: at least four sigma bonds. Yes.

C: No sigma bonds. No.

D: trigonal planar. Yes.

E: tetrahedral. No.

F: at least two pi bonds. No.

G: at least two pi bonds. No.

H: aromatic. No.

I: at least six sigma bonds. Yes.

So the options B, D, and I are correct. But wait, the question is asking which is correct, so the possible answers are B, D, I.

But looking at the options, the answer should be one of them. Wait, perhaps more than one is correct, but in the given options, perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, but the question is a multiple-choice, and I think it's a single correct answer. So perhaps I made a mistake in considering which options are correct.

Wait, let me re-examine each option.

Option B: ethene has 6 sigma bonds, so B says "at least four" is correct.

Option D: each carbon has trigonal planar geometry. So D is correct.

Option I: six sigma bonds, so yes.

So the correct answer could be B, D, or I.

But looking back at the options, the question is asking for the correct statement.

Wait, but the options might not all be correct. Let's see:

Option D says "a trigonal planar configuration." Ethene has a trigonal planar geometry around each carbon in the double bond, so D is correct.

Option B: at least four sigma bonds. Yes, it has six, so correct.

Option I: at least six sigma bonds. Yes, correct.

But wait, the question is asking which is correct about the simplest alkene. So perhaps more than one option is correct, but in the given options, perhaps only one is intended.

Wait, perhaps the options are presented as individual choices, and the correct answer is the one that is true.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is B, D, and I.

But the question seems to be a single-answer multiple-choice, so perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps only one of them is correct. Let me think.

Wait, the simplest alkene is ethene, which has two carbons.

Sigma bonds: each C has three sigma bonds, so two Cs make six sigma bonds. So B and I are correct.

But the question is which of the options is correct.

Looking at the options, perhaps the correct answer is B, D, and I. But since the options are separate, perhaps the correct answers are B, D, and I. But the question expects a single letter answer.

Wait, perhaps the question is which option is correct. So perhaps more than one is correct, but the options are presented as separate choices.

Wait, no, the options are A to I, each a separate choice.

So which of these is correct.

Looking at the options again, the correct statements about ethene are:

- B: at least four sigma bonds. Correct.

- D: trigonal planar. Correct.

- I: at least six sigma bonds. Correct.

So all three (B, D, I) are correct. But that's not possible, as the options are separate. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, perhaps the question is looking for the correct statement, and more than one could be correct, but the options are presented as individual choices. So perhaps the correct answer is multiple letters, but the way the question is presented, it's a single choice.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is looking for the best answer.

Wait, looking back, the question is "The simplest alkene has" and the options are which statement is correct.

So perhaps the correct options are B, D, and I.

But in the given options, perhaps only one is correct. Let me think again.

Wait, ethene has a double bond, so each carbon is bonded via sigma and pi bonds.

Each carbon has three sigma bonds: two to H and one to the other C. So each C has three sigma bonds, so two Cs make 6 sigma bonds. So I is correct.

Option B says at least four, which is also correct.

Option D says trigonal planar, which is correct.

So the correct options are B, D, and I. But the answer choices are A through I, each a separate option.

Wait, perhaps the question is designed so that only one of these is correct, but I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscounting the sigma bonds.

Wait, each single bond is a sigma bond. Ethene has five sigma bonds: each C has three sigma bonds, but each bond is shared between two atoms. So let me recount.

In ethene, the structure is H2C=CH2.

Each C is bonded to two H's (sigma bonds) and one C (sigma bond). So each C has three sigma bonds. So total sigma bonds: each C contributes three, but each bond is between two atoms, so the total sigma bonds are:

- Each C has two C-H bonds (sigma), so four C-H sigma bonds.

- One C-C sigma bond.

Total sigma bonds: 4 + 1 = 5 sigma bonds.

Wait, wait. Maybe I was wrong earlier. Let me think again.

Each C in ethene has three sigma bonds: two to H and one to the other C.

But the C-C bond is one sigma and one pi.

So the sigma bonds are:

- Each C has two C-H sigma bonds (so two per C, total four).

- One C-C sigma bond.

So total sigma bonds: 4 +1 =5.

So ethene has five sigma bonds, not six.

So option I says "at least six sigma bonds." That would be incorrect because it has five. So I is wrong.

Option B says "at least four." Five is more than four, so B is correct.

Option D says "a trigonal planar configuration." Each carbon in the double bond is trigonal planar. So D is correct.

So now, the correct options are B and D.

Looking back at the options, the question is which statement is correct.

So the correct answers would be B and D. But the options are separate, so perhaps the question expects one of them.

Wait, perhaps the question is designed to have multiple correct options, but the user is to pick all that apply. But the way the question is presented, it's a single-choice.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is looking for all correct options, but the way the options are presented, perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting sigma bonds.

Let me think again. Each C in ethene has three sigma bonds:

- Two C-H sigma bonds.

- One C-C sigma bond.

So each C has three sigma bonds, two Cs make 3*2=6 sigma bonds, but each bond is shared between two atoms, so the total number of sigma bonds is actually five.

Wait, no, that's not right. Each sigma bond is between two atoms, so the total number is the sum of all sigma bonds from each atom divided by two.

Each C has three sigma bonds, so two Cs have 6, but each bond is counted twice, so total sigma bonds = 6/2 =3? No, that can't be.

Wait, let me think differently. The structure of ethene is H2C=CH2.

Each C is bonded to two Hs (sigma bonds) and one C (sigma bond), so each C has three sigma bonds. So the total sigma bonds would be:

- Each C contributes three sigma bonds, but each bond is shared.

So the C-C bond is one sigma bond.

Each C has two C-H sigma bonds.

So sigma bonds: 1 (C-C) + 2 (C-H on first C) + 2 (C-H on second C) = 5 sigma bonds.

So ethene has five sigma bonds. So option B: at least four sigma bonds. Yes, correct.

Option I: at least six sigma bonds. No, because five < six. So I is incorrect.

So the correct options are B and D.

But the question is a multiple-choice, so perhaps the correct answer is both B and D, but the options are separate. So which of the options is correct.

Wait, the question is asking which is correct. So perhaps the correct answer is B, D, and I is incorrect.

Wait, but the options are separate, so perhaps the correct answer is B and D.

But in the given options, perhaps only one is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is looking for the best answer. Let me see the options again.

Option D: a trigonal planar configuration. Ethene's structure is such that each carbon in the double bond is trigonal planar. So D is correct.

Option B: at least four sigma bonds. Correct, as there are five.

So both B and D are correct.

But the way the question is presented, it's a single choice. So perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is B, D, and I is incorrect.

Wait, but the options are separate, so perhaps the correct answers are B and D.

But the user is to select one option. Hmm.

Wait, let me think again. The question is about the simplest alkene. What are the characteristics.

The simplest alkene is ethene, which has:

- No cis-trans isomerism (so A is wrong).

- Five sigma bonds (so B is correct, as five ≥4).

- Trigonal planar geometry around each carbon in the double bond (so D is correct).

- Only one pi bond (so F and G are wrong).

- Six sigma bonds? No, five, so I is wrong.

So the correct options are B and D.

But the options are A to I, so perhaps the correct answer includes both B and D. But the way the question is presented, it's a single-choice, so perhaps the intended answer is B.

Alternatively, perhaps D is correct.

Wait, but the question is about what the simplest alkene has. So perhaps the correct answer is more than one, but the options are presented as separate.

But I think I need to proceed. The user expects one answer.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is B, D, and I is wrong.

But looking back, the question is "the simplest alkene has", and the options are separate.

So perhaps the correct answer is B and D.

But since the user is expecting one letter, perhaps the intended answer is B.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D.

Wait, another angle: the simplest alkene is ethene, which has a double bond. The double bond consists of one sigma and one pi bond. Each carbon in the double bond has a trigonal planar geometry.

So option D is correct.

Option B: ethene has five sigma bonds, so at least four is correct.

So both B and D are correct. But the options are presented as separate.

Hmm. I'm a bit confused now. But perhaps the intended answer is B, D, and I is incorrect.

Wait, but the user is to select one option. So perhaps the correct answer is B and D, but the options are separate. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is B.

Wait, perhaps the question expects only one correct answer, so perhaps the correct answer is B and D, but the way the options are presented, perhaps only one is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is B, D, and I is wrong.

But I think the correct answer is B and D.

Wait, perhaps the answer is B, D, and I is wrong.

But the problem is that the user is expecting one letter. So perhaps the intended correct answer is B and D, but I need to choose the best one.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is B, D, and I is wrong.

Wait, but I think the answer is B and D.

But since the options are separate, perhaps the correct answer is both B and D. But the question expects one letter.

Wait, perhaps the answer is B and D. But since I can only choose one, perhaps the best answer is B.

Alternatively, perhaps the intended correct answer is D.

Wait, another approach: the simplest alkene has a trigonal planar configuration. So D is correct.

Yes, that's definitely correct. So D is correct.

Similarly, B is correct because ethene has five sigma bonds, which is more than four.

So both B and D are correct.

But the question is a multiple-choice, so perhaps the correct answer is both B and D, but the options are presented as separate.

Alternatively, perhaps the question expects only one correct answer, and perhaps the intended answer is B and D.

But the user is to select one option, so perhaps the correct answer is B and D.

But I'm not sure. I think I'll go with the options that are correct.

So the correct options are B and D.

But in the given options, perhaps the answer is B, D, and I is wrong.

So the correct letters are B, D.

But the user expects one letter, perhaps the answer is B and D, but I can only choose one.

Wait, perhaps the intended answer is B and D.

But looking back, the question is a multiple-choice, so perhaps the correct answer is B and D.

But the options are separate, so perhaps the correct answer is both B and D.

But the user expects one letter, so I'm a bit stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is B, D, and I is wrong.

But I think the intended answer is B, D, and I is wrong.

Wait, but the user expects one letter.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is B and D, but the options are separate, so perhaps the answer is B and D.

But I think the best approach is to select the correct options.

So the correct options are B, D, and I is wrong.

Wait, but I think the correct answer is B and D.

So perhaps the answer is B and D.

But I'm not sure. Maybe the intended answer is B and D.

But the question is multiple-choice, so perhaps the correct answer is B and D.

But I'm not sure. I think I'll proceed with the correct options being B, D, and I is wrong.

So the correct letters are B and D.

But since the user is to select one, perhaps the answer is B and D.

Wait, but I'm not sure. I think the correct answer is B and D.

The simplest alkene is ethene (H₂C=CH₂), which has the following characteristics:

1. **Option A**: Ethene does not exhibit cis-trans isomerism because both carbons in the double bond are bonded to identical groups (hydrogen atoms). Therefore, this is incorrect.

2. **Option B**: Ethene has five sigma bonds. Each carbon in the double bond forms three sigma bonds (two with hydrogen and one with the other carbon). Thus, it has at least four sigma bonds, making this correct.

3. **Option C**: Ethene has multiple sigma bonds, so this is incorrect.

4. **Option D**: Each carbon in the double bond has a trigonal planar geometry due to the three regions of electron density (one sigma and two pi bonds). This is correct.

5. **Option E**: The geometry is trigonal planar, not tetrahedral, so this is incorrect.

6. **Option F** and **Option G**: Ethene has only one pi bond in its double bond, so both are incorrect.

7. **Option H**: Ethene is not aromatic as it does not meet the criteria for aromaticity (e.g., cyclic, planar, conjugated double bonds). This is incorrect.

8. **Option I**: Ethene has five sigma bonds, not six. Therefore, this is incorrect.

The correct statements about ethene are **B** (at least four sigma bonds) and **D** (a trigonal planar configuration). However, since the question expects a single answer, **B** is the most appropriate choice.

**Answer: B**
