Question:

A defendant was on the first day of her new secretarial job when her boss called her into his office. The boss directly suggested that if the defendant did not go out on a date with him, she would be fired in one week. Every day during the remainder of the week, the boss approached the defendant with his demand, and the defendant refused to cooperate. At the end of the week, when the boss called the defendant into his office and again tried to pressure her to go out on a date with him, the defendant knocked him unconscious with a giant stapler and choked him to death. The defendant is tried for murder. In accordance with the following statute, the state relies at trial on the presumption of malice:"When the act of killing another is proved, malice aforethought shall be presumed, and the burden shall rest upon the party who committed the killing to show that malice did not exist. "If the defendant is convicted of first-degree murder and challenges her conviction on the grounds of the above statute, on appeal she will

Options:

A: lose, because the presumption may be rebutted.
B: win, because the statute violates due process.
C: lose, because the presumption of malice aforethought is constitutional.
D: win, because she acted in self-defense.
E: lose, because her actions were premeditated.
F: win, because the statute is unjust.
G: lose, because she did not show that malice did not exist.
H: win, because the statute is discriminatory.
I: lose, because she failed to overcome the presumption.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this law question about murder and a statute's constitutionality. Let me break it down step by step. 

The scenario is that a defendant starts her new job as a secretary. On the first day, her boss calls her into his office and suggests that if she doesn't go out on a date with him, she'll be fired in a week. Every day after that, the boss keeps pressuring her, and she keeps refusing. At the end of the week, when he tries to pressure her again, she knocks him unconscious with a stapler and chokes him to death. She's then tried for murder.

The state uses a statute that presumes malice aforethought when the act of killing is proved. The burden is on the defendant to show that malice didn't exist. The defendant was convicted of first-degree murder and is challenging her conviction based on this statute.

So the question is, on appeal, will she win or lose? The options are A to I.

First, I need to recall what malice aforethought means. In criminal law, malice can be express or implied. Express malice is intentional killing, while implied malice can be from acts showing a wanton disregard for human life, like during the commission of another felony (like robbery or arson). First-degree murder typically requires malice and premeditation.

The statute in question says that when the act of killing is proved, malice is presumed, and the defendant has to show it didn't exist. This sounds like a rebuttable presumption. So the state doesn't have to prove malice beyond a reasonable doubt; instead, the burden shifts to the defendant to show the absence of malice.

Now, I remember something about the Due Process Clause and criminal presumptions. There's a case, I think, called Mullaney v. Wilbur, where the Supreme Court held that a state cannot shift the burden of proof on an essential element of a crime to the defendant without violating due process. Specifically, if the state must prove an element (like malice), they can't create a presumption that shifts that burden; the defendant can't be forced to prove the negative.

In this case, the statute presumes malice, which is an essential element for first-degree murder. So the state isn't proving malice; instead, the defendant has to show it didn't exist. That seems unconstitutional under Mullaney because it violates the defendant's due process rights. The state must prove beyond a reasonable doubt every element of the crime, including malice.

Wait, but wait. There's another case, I think, where the Supreme Court said that a rebuttable presumption is okay if it doesn't shift the burden entirely. For example, if the state can prove the basic facts, then a presumption can shift the burden on a specific element, but only if the defendant has a chance to rebut it. But in Mullaney, the issue was that the state's law required the defendant to prove the absence of heat of passion, which was an affirmative defense. The Court said that shifting the burden like that was a problem.

So applying that here, the statute presumes malice, which is an essential element for first-degree murder. The defendant would have to prove it wasn't present. That would mean the state doesn't have to prove malice; the defendant does. This seems like a violation of due process because it shifts the burden on an essential element.

Therefore, the statute is unconstitutional because it violates the Due Process Clause by shifting the burden to the defendant to disprove malice. So when the defendant appeals, she should win because the statute is unconstitutional.

Looking at the options, option B says she wins because the statute violates due process. That seems correct.

Wait, but I should check other options to be sure. Option A says she loses because the presumption can be rebutted. But even if it can be rebutted, the issue is whether the statute's approach is constitutional. The problem isn't whether she can rebut but whether the state can presume malice and shift the burden. So A isn't the right reason.

Option C says she loses because the presumption is constitutional. But I think the Supreme Court has found such presumptions unconstitutional in certain cases, like Mullaney, so C is incorrect.

Option D says she wins because she acted in self-defense. But the question doesn't mention her arguing self-defense; it's about the statute. So D isn't relevant here.

Option E says she loses because her actions were premeditated. But again, the issue is the statute, not whether her actions were premeditated.

Option F says she wins because the statute is unjust. Unjust is a bit vague, and the issue is about constitutional violations, not just fairness.

Option G says she loses because she didn't show malice didn't exist. But the issue isn't about the evidence; it's about the statute's constitutionality. The trial court might have applied the wrong law, so G isn't the right reason.

Option H says she wins because the statute is discriminatory. There's no indication the statute is discriminatory based on race or gender here; it applies generally, so H seems off.

Option I says she loses because she failed to overcome the presumption. Again, the problem is the statute's constitutionality, not whether she rebutted it.

So the correct answer should be B: win because the statute violates due process.
</think>

The defendant's case hinges on the constitutionality of the statute that presumes malice aforethought and shifts the burden to her to prove its absence. The Supreme Court has ruled that such statutes violate the Due Process Clause by improperly shifting the burden of proof on an essential element of a crime to the defendant. Since malice is an essential element of first-degree murder, the state cannot presume its existence and require the defendant to disprove it. Therefore, the statute is unconstitutional, and the defendant should win her appeal on these grounds.
