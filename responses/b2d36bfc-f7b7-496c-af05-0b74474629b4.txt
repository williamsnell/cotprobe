Okay, so I have this question about atoms and their masses. The question says that less than 1/1000 of the mass of any atom is contributed by something, and I have to pick which option it is from A to J.

Hmm, I remember from my science classes that atoms are made up of protons, neutrons, and electrons. Protons and neutrons are in the nucleus, right? And electrons orbit around the nucleus. But wait, I think most of the mass comes from the nucleus because protons and neutrons are much heavier than electrons.

Wait, the question is about what contributes less than 1/1000 of the mass. That's a tiny fraction. So electrons must be it because they're much lighter. Let me think: protons have a mass of about 1 atomic mass unit each, neutrons are similar, and electrons are about 1/1836th the mass of a proton. So electrons contribute almost nothing compared to protons and neutrons.

Looking at the options, let's go through them. Option A says protons, electrons, and neutrons. But that's all the particles, so their combined mass would be almost the entire atom's mass, which can't be the answer because the question is about something contributing less than 1/1000.

Option B: electrons and protons. Well, protons make up most of the mass, so B isn't it.

Option C: the nucleus. The nucleus has protons and neutrons, which make up almost all the mass, so C isn't the answer.

Option D: protons. No, they contribute most of the mass.

Option E: neutrons. Same as protons, they're heavy.

Option F: protons and neutrons. That's the nucleus, so they contribute almost all the mass.

Option G: electrons. Yes, since electrons are so light, their mass is way less than 1/1000 of the atom's total mass.

Option H: protons and electrons. Again, protons make this too heavy.

Option I: electrons and neutrons. Neutrons are heavy, so no.

Option J: electrons and the nucleus. The nucleus contributes most of the mass, so this isn't it.

So the correct answer should be G: the electrons.

The correct answer is G: the electrons.
