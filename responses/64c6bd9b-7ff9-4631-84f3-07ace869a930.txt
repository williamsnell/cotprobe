Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how much a queen and a king are worth together in blackjack. I know that in blackjack, face cards usually have a value, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact details. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that in blackjack, the goal is to get as close to 21 as possible without going over. The cards have specific values: face cards (Jack, Queen, King) are each worth 10, and an Ace can be worth either 1 or 11. Number cards are worth their face value, so 2 through 10 are worth 2 through 10 respectively.

Wait, so the question is about a queen and a king. Each of these is a face card. So if each is worth 10, then adding them together would be 10 plus 10. Let me do that math: 10 + 10 equals 20. So together, they should be worth 20.

Looking at the answer options, I see option G is 20. So that must be the correct answer. But just to make sure I'm not making a mistake, let me double-check. Queen is 10, King is 10, together 20. Yep, that's right. I don't think I'm missing anything here. Sometimes in games, there are special rules, but blackjack standard rules say face cards are 10 each. So I'm confident the answer is 20.

The queen and king are each worth 10 in blackjack, so together they add up to 20.
