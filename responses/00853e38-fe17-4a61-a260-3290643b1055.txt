Okay, so I need to figure out the answer to this torts question. Let me read it carefully.

So there's a 12-year-old girl and her friends playing catch with a baseball in a park field. Near the edge, a woman is sitting in a beach chair reading. The girl throws the ball too far, it goes over her friends' heads and flies toward the woman. The woman didn't see the ball coming, so it hits her straw hat, knocking it off. The ball didn't touch her, but she was startled and fell from the chair, breaking her arm.

The question is, if the woman sues the girl for damages, what will happen?

The options are A through J, involving different torts like negligence, battery, assault, etc.

First, I need to break down the elements of each possible tort.

Starting with negligence. Negligence requires duty, breach, causation, and damages. So, was the girl negligent? She was playing catch, which is a game that involves throwing a ball. Since she's a kid, 12 years old, maybe she's not expected to have the same level of care as an adult. But in general, when playing in a public place, you have to be careful not to harm others nearby.

The woman was sitting near the edge of the field, reading. The girl threw the ball too far, which hit her hat. So, was the girl's action foreseeable that it could hit someone nearby? Probably, since they were in a public area, and the ball went beyond her friends towards the woman. So there's a duty of care, and the breach would be if the girl didn't exercise reasonable care in throwing the ball. If the girl threw it without looking or without considering where it might go, that could be a breach.

Causation: The ball hit the hat, which caused the woman to be startled, fall, and break her arm. So yes, the girl's action caused the injury.

Damages: The broken arm is clear.

So for negligence, the elements seem to be present. But wait, the woman wasn't touched by the ball, only her hat. So in terms of battery, which is an intentional tort, you need harmful or offensive contact with the person. Here, the contact was with the hat, not her person. So battery might not apply.

Assault, on the other hand, involves the apprehension of harmful contact. The woman was startled because the ball hit her hat. But she wasn't actually touched. So was there an assault? For assault, the defendant must cause the plaintiff to reasonably believe that harmful contact is imminent. Here, the ball hit her hat, but she wasn't touched. So maybe she felt an impact, but it was through the hat. Does that count as assault?

I'm not sure. In some cases, if the contact is with an object thrown, it could be considered assault if it causes a harmful contact. But the woman wasn't touched; the hat was. So maybe not. Alternatively, the woman might have been in apprehension of being hit, but the ball went through the hat. So perhaps she didn't actually fear imminent contact because the ball didn't hit her. Or maybe the sudden impact on her hat would have made her feel like she was hit, leading to the fear.

Alternatively, the woman's injury was due to negligence, not intentional torts. So perhaps the woman can only recover under negligence, not battery or assault.

Looking at the options:

A: Recover for personal injury. That's a bit vague. Personal injury could be under negligence or intentional torts.

B: Not recover because she was at fault for not paying attention. That would be contributory negligence. But in many jurisdictions, contributory negligence is not a complete bar, especially for children. Also, the woman was reading; maybe she wasn't watching, but the girl threw the ball into an area where people are present. So maybe the girl's negligence is still the primary cause.

C: Recover for battery only. But the ball didn't touch her, so no battery.

D: Recover for assault and battery. Again, no battery, so not this.

E: Recover for both negligence and assault. If assault applies, maybe. But I'm not sure if assault does.

F: Recover for intentional infliction of emotional distress. That's a high bar, requiring extreme and outrageous conduct. Throwing a ball that hits a hat doesn't seem to meet that.

G: Recover for negligence only. That seems possible if the girl was negligent.

H: Recover for assault only. If there's no battery, but maybe assault. But as I thought earlier, maybe not.

I: Not recover. If the girl was negligent, then the woman should recover.

J: Recover for both negligence and battery. But no battery.

So, the options suggest that the correct answer might be G or E or J.

Wait, but did the girl commit battery? The ball didn't touch the woman. So no battery. So J is out. So what about assault? The woman was hit in the hat, but she wasn't touched. So was there an assault?

Assault requires a reasonable apprehension of imminent harmful contact. The ball hitting her hat might have caused her to believe she was hit, but she wasn't. So perhaps she felt the impact through the hat, which might make her believe she was hit. Alternatively, the fact that the ball struck her hat could be seen as an assault because it's an intentional act that caused her to be startled.

Wait, but the girl didn't intend to hit the woman. She was playing catch. So maybe it's not intentional. Therefore, assault as an intentional tort wouldn't apply because the girl didn't intend to hit the woman. So perhaps the only claim is negligence.

So the woman would recover under negligence only, which is option G.

Alternatively, if the woman can claim both negligence and something else, but I don't think so. Since no battery or assault applies as intentional torts, but maybe negligence is the only claim.

So the answer should be G: recover for negligence only.
</think>

The correct answer is G: recover for negligence only.

The woman can recover damages under negligence because the girl owed a duty of care while playing catch in a public area. The girl breached this duty by throwing the ball without ensuring it wouldn't harm others nearby. The ball hitting the hat caused the woman to fall and break her arm, establishing causation and damages. Since the ball didn't touch the woman, battery and assault don't apply. Intentional infliction of emotional distress is also too high a bar. Therefore, the woman can recover under negligence only.

Answer: G
