Okay, so I need to figure out which of the given options is a member of the cucumber family. Let's start by recalling what the cucumber family is. I think it's also known as the Cucurbitaceae family. I remember that cucumbers themselves are part of this family, but there are other plants too.

Looking at the options, I have A through J. Let's go through each one. 

A: Carrot. I know carrots are root vegetables, and they belong to the Apiaceae family, not Cucurbitaceae. So A is out.

B: Lettuce. Lettuce is a leafy green, part of the Asteraceae family. Definitely not the same family as cucumbers. So B is not it.

C: Potato. Potatoes are tubers and belong to the Solanaceae family, which also includes tomatoes. So C is not correct.

D: Green bean. Green beans are legumes, part of the Fabaceae family. So D is out.

E: Radish. Radishes are root vegetables, also in the Brassicaceae family. So E is not the answer.

F: Apple. Apples are in the Rosaceae family, which includes many fruit trees. So F is incorrect.

G: Green pepper. Green peppers are a type of chili, part of the Solanaceae family, same as tomatoes and potatoes. So G is not the right answer.

H: Corn. Corn is a grain, part of the Poaceae family. So H is out.

I: Watermelon. Wait, watermelons are fruits, and I think they are related to cucumbers. Let me think. Yes, watermelons are in the Cucurbitaceae family. They have a similar structure and growth pattern to cucumbers, so I believe I is the correct answer.

J: Tomato. Tomatoes are in the Solanaceae family, same as potatoes and green peppers. So J is not the answer.

So, going through all the options, the only one that fits is I: watermelon.

The correct answer is I: watermelon, as it belongs to the Cucurbitaceae family.
