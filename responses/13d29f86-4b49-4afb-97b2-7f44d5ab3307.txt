Okay, so I've got this economics question here, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let me read it again.

The question says that current disposable income is $10,000, and consumption spending is $8,000. Then it says that for every $100 increase in disposable income, saving increases by $10. I need to find out which of the options A to J is correct regarding the marginal propensity to save or consume.

Alright, first, I should remember what marginal propensity to save (MPS) and marginal propensity to consume (MPC) mean. From what I recall, MPS is the fraction of an additional dollar of disposable income that is saved. Similarly, MPC is the fraction that is spent on consumption.

So, the initial disposable income is $10,000, and consumption is $8,000. That means saving is income minus consumption, which is $10,000 - $8,000 = $2,000. So, with a $10k income, saving is $2k.

Now, the question says that for every $100 increase in income, saving increases by $10. So, if disposable income goes up by $100, saving goes up by $10. That means the MPS is 10/100, which is 0.10. Because MPS is the change in saving divided by the change in income.

Wait, let me check that again. Change in saving is +$10 for a $100 increase in income. So, 10 divided by 100 is 0.10, so MPS is 0.10. That would make option H correct because H says MPS is 0.10.

But wait, let's think about the initial values. At $10,000 income, saving is $2,000. So, the initial saving is 2,000/10,000 = 0.20, which is 20%. But that's the average propensity to save, not the marginal. Because MPS is about the change, not the total.

So, the initial saving is 20% of income, but when income increases by $100, saving only increases by $10. So, the MPS is 10/100 = 0.10, which is 10%. So that's option H.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm not confusing average and marginal. Average propensity to save (APS) is total saving divided by total income. So, 2000/10000 is 0.20. But MPS is the change in saving per change in income. So, yes, 10/100 = 0.10.

So, looking at the options, H is "the marginal propensity to save is .10." So that should be correct.

Let me check the other options to make sure I'm not missing something.

Option A: MPS is 0.80. That seems high, considering the change is only 10% of the income change.

Option B: MPS 0.90. Also too high.

Option C: MPS 0.20. That's the average, not marginal.

Option D: MPC 0.20. If saving increases by 10% of the income change, then consumption must increase by 90% of the income change, because 1 - MPS = MPC. So 1 - 0.10 = 0.90. So MPC is 0.90, but option D says 0.20, which is not correct.

Option E: MPS 0.50. No, that's higher than our calculation.

Option F: MPC 0.10. That would mean people save 90% (since 1-0.10=0.90), which isn't the case here.

Option G: MPC 0.70. Hmm, if MPC is 0.70, then MPS would be 0.30. But our calculation shows MPS is 0.10, so this wouldn't fit.

Option I: MPC 0.80. If MPC is 0.80, then MPS is 0.20. But again, our MPS is 0.10, so this isn't right.

So, the only correct one is H: MPS is 0.10.

The correct answer is H: the marginal propensity to save is .10.

Answer: H
