Question:

Why is a retail sales tax of 4% not proportional but regressive?

Options:

A: The 4% retail sales tax decreases in percentage as the amount spent on consumption increases.
B: The 4% retail sales tax is regressive because it applies only to luxury goods, which lower income groups do not purchase.
C: The 4% retail sales tax is a flat tax, so it affects all income groups equally.
D: Lower income groups receive a subsidy that offsets the 4% retail sales tax.
E: Higher income groups pay more retail sales tax because they have more income.
F: Higher income groups are taxed at a higher rate with the 4% retail sales tax.
G: Lower income groups are exempt from the 4% retail sales tax.
H: The 4% retail sales tax is proportional because everyone pays the same rate.
I: The 4% retail sales tax is adjusted based on the buyer's income level, with higher incomes paying a lower percentage.
J: A 4% retail sales tax is regressive because lower income groups spend a greater proportion of their income on consumption, resulting in a higher effective rate of taxation for them compared to higher income groups.

Okay, so I need to figure out why a 4% retail sales tax is considered regressive rather than proportional. Hmm, let me start by recalling some basic concepts about taxes. 

A proportional tax, also known as a flat tax, is one where everyone pays the same percentage of their income in taxes. So, whether you make $1,000 or $10,000, you'd pay the same percentage rate. On the other hand, a regressive tax is one where the tax rate decreases as the amount subject to taxation increases. So, people with lower incomes pay a higher percentage of their income in taxes compared to those with higher incomes.

Wait, but in this case, it's a sales tax, not an income tax. Retail sales tax applies to the purchase price of goods. So, if it's a 4% sales tax, everyone pays 4% on whatever they buy. But why would that be regressive?

Let me think. If a lower-income person buys something, they spend a larger portion of their income on that purchase. For example, if someone makes $20,000 a year and buys a $100 item, they spend 0.5% of their income on tax (4% of $100 is $4, which is 0.5% of $20,000). But a higher-income person, say making $100,000, buys the same $100 item. The tax is $4, which is only 0.04% of their income. So the percentage of their income taxed is lower for the higher earner. That means the tax is taking a bigger bite out of lower incomes, making it regressive.

Looking at the options:

Option J says, "A 4% retail sales tax is regressive because lower income groups spend a greater proportion of their income on consumption, resulting in a higher effective rate of taxation for them compared to higher income groups." That sounds exactly like what I was thinking.

Option A says the tax decreases as spending increases. Wait, that might be the case if the percentage rate went down, but here it's a flat 4%. So A might be incorrect because it's not decreasing; it's the same rate. 

Option B says it's regressive because it applies only to luxury goods. But no, sales tax usually applies to a wide range of goods, including necessities. So that's not right.

Option C says it's a flat tax, affecting all equally. But that's not true because the impact is different based on income. So C is incorrect.

Option D talks about a subsidy offsetting the tax. I don't think that's part of the question, so probably not relevant here.

Option E says higher income pays more because they have more income. But the sales tax isn't based on income; it's based on spending. So higher income people might spend more, but the rate is the same. So E is not correct.

Option F says higher incomes are taxed at a higher rate, which is not true because the rate is the same. So F is wrong.

Option G says lower income groups are exempt, which isn't the case here; the tax applies to everyone.

Option H says it's proportional because everyone pays the same rate, but that's not considering the differing impact based on income levels. So H is incorrect.

Option I says the tax is adjusted based on income, which it's not; it's a flat 4%. So I is wrong.

So the correct answer must be J.

The 4% retail sales tax is regressive because lower-income individuals spend a larger proportion of their income on consumption. As a result, the effective tax rate they pay is higher compared to higher-income individuals, who spend a smaller proportion of their income on taxable goods. This makes the tax regressive, as it disproportionately affects lower-income groups.
