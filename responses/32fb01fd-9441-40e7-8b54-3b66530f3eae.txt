Okay, so I need to figure out the total cost Mr. Taylor paid for purchasing the stocks. Let me break this down step by step.

First, there are two stocks involved: Magee Data and Giant Industrials. Mr. Taylor bought shares of both on July 7th. 

For Magee Data, he bought 300 shares at the high of the day. The high was 23 and 1/8. I should convert that fraction into decimal to make calculations easier. 1/8 is 0.125, so 23.125 dollars per share.

Then, for Giant Industrials, he bought 400 shares at the low of the day. The low was 23 and 1/2. 1/2 is 0.5, so that's 23.5 dollars per share.

Now, I need to calculate the cost for each purchase separately and then add them together.

Starting with Magee Data: 300 shares * 23.125 dollars. Let me compute that. 300 times 23 is 6,900. Then 300 times 0.125 is 37.5. Adding those together gives 6,900 + 37.5 = 6,937.50 dollars.

Next, Giant Industrials: 400 shares * 23.5 dollars. 400 times 23 is 9,200. 400 times 0.5 is 200. So 9,200 + 200 = 9,400 dollars.

Now, add both amounts together to get the total cost. 6,937.50 + 9,400 = 16,337.50 dollars.

Looking at the options, option I is $16,337.50. So that should be the correct answer.

The cost of purchasing 300 shares of Magee Data at $23.125 each is $6,937.50, and 400 shares of Giant Industrials at $23.50 each is $9,400.00. Adding these gives a total of $16,337.50.
