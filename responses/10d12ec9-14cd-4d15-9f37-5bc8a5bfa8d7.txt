Question:

A rancher, being owner in fee simpleconveyed the property by warranty deed to a woman. The woman gave her niece a mortgage on the ranch to secure a loan from the niece to the woman in the amount of $500,000. The mortgage was recorded immediately. Two years later, the woman conveyed the ranch to a farmer by quitclaim deed. The woman then defaulted on the mortgage, and the niece brought an in personam action against the farmer to recover the amount of the mortgage due. Assume that the woman's quitclaim deed to the farmer made no reference to the mortgage. The woman then defaulted on the mortgage, and the niece brought an in personam action against the farmer to recover the amount of the mortgage due. The mortgagee will probably

Options:

A: succeed, because the mortgage was recorded immediately.
B: not succeed, because the quitclaim deed did not reference the mortgage.
C: succeed, because an implied delegation of duties resulted from the woman's conveyance to the farmer.
D: not succeed, because the farmer was not a party to the original mortgage contract.
E: succeed, because the quitclaim deed does not absolve the farmer of the mortgage debt.
F: not succeed, unless the farmer had constructive notice of the existence of the mortgage.
G: succeed, because the niece was a third-party beneficiary under the conveyance between the woman and the farmer.
H: not succeed, because the woman was still legally responsible for the mortgage debt.
I: not succeed, because the farmer did not promise to pay the mortgage debt.
J: succeed, because the farmer implicitly accepted responsibility for the mortgage by accepting the quitclaim deed.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this legal question about mortgages and deeds. Let me read through the scenario again to make sure I understand it.

So, there's a rancher who owns the property in fee simple, which means she owns it outright. She conveyed the property by warranty deed to a woman. Then, this woman gave her niece a mortgage on the ranch to secure a loan of $500,000. The mortgage was recorded right away. Two years later, the woman conveys the ranch to a farmer using a quitclaim deed, and this deed didn't mention the mortgage. Then the woman defaulted on the mortgage, and the niece sued the farmer in personam to recover the debt.

The question is, will the mortgagee (the niece) probably succeed in her action against the farmer? There are several options to consider from A to J.

Hmm, let's break this down. First, I need to understand the types of deeds involved. A warranty deed typically conveys the property with certain warranties, like that the grantor has clear title. But the key here is the mortgage situation.

The woman gave a mortgage to her niece, which is a lien on the property. The mortgage was recorded immediately, which is important because recording gives notice to subsequent purchasers. So, if the farmer had any notice, actual or constructive, of the mortgage, that might affect things.

But the woman later conveyed the property to the farmer via a quitclaim deed. A quitclaim deed doesn't provide any warranties and only transfers whatever interest the grantor has. Importantly, it doesn't transfer any liens or encumbrances unless specified. Since the deed made no reference to the mortgage, the farmer didn't take on the mortgage obligation.

Wait, but the mortgage was recorded. So, when the woman conveyed the property to the farmer, the farmer would have had constructive notice of the mortgage because it's recorded. But wait, no, the mortgage is a lien against the property, so when the woman conveyed the deed, the mortgage would still be attached to the property. But the question is about whether the farmer is personally liable on the mortgage debt. 

Mortgages are generally debts of the borrower. The mortgage itself is a lien on the property, but the personal obligation to repay the loan remains with the borrower. So, when the woman conveyed the property to the farmer, unless the farmer assumed the mortgage, he wouldn't be personally liable. The mortgagee (niece) can foreclose on the property, but can she sue the farmer personally?

In personam jurisdiction is about the person's liability, not the property. So, the niece suing the farmer in personam would require that the farmer is liable on the debt. But since the farmer didn't sign the mortgage note, he didn't promise to pay the debt. The only one liable is the woman.

But wait, the question is about whether the mortgagee can recover against the farmer. The mortgage is a security interest; the note is the actual debt. The mortgagee can foreclose on the property but can't make the farmer pay the debt unless he's a party to the note or has assumed it.

Looking at the options:

Option D says the mortgagee won't succeed because the farmer wasn't a party to the original mortgage contract. That makes sense because the mortgagee can't hold the farmer liable unless he agreed to it.

Option F mentions constructive notice, but that relates more to whether the farmer knew about the mortgage when buying the property, affecting their rights, but not their personal liability on the debt.

Option H says the woman is still responsible, which is true, but the question is about the farmer's liability, so H doesn't directly answer the mortgagee's success against the farmer.

So, the correct answer should be D: the mortgagee will not succeed because the farmer wasn't a party to the original mortgage contract.

The mortgagee (niece) cannot succeed in an in personam action against the farmer because the farmer was not a party to the original mortgage contract. The mortgage was a debt of the woman, and the quitclaim deed did not transfer personal liability for the debt to the farmer. 

Answer: D
