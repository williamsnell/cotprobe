Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to find the velocity of a mass in a spring-mass system as a function of displacement. Let me try to think through this step by step.

The problem says the acceleration a(x) is given by - (k/m)x. The mass is started from rest at a displacement of -ρ. I need to find v as a function of x. Hmm. Right, this seems related to simple harmonic motion because the acceleration is proportional to the displacement with a negative sign, which is characteristic of SHM.

I remember that in SHM, the equation of motion is F = -kx, leading to acceleration a = -(k/m)x. So that matches the given a(x). Now, the mass starts from rest, so its initial velocity is zero. The initial displacement is x = -ρ. But wait, usually in SHM, the maximum displacement is called the amplitude. So here, the amplitude would be ρ because the displacement is -ρ when the mass is released from rest.

I think the key here is to use the conservation of energy. Since there's no damping mentioned, mechanical energy is conserved. The total mechanical energy E is the sum of kinetic and potential energies. At the initial position, when the mass is at rest (v=0), all the energy is potential. And as it moves, potential energy converts to kinetic energy and vice versa.

The potential energy for a spring is (1/2)kx². Kinetic energy is (1/2)mv². So at any point, E = (1/2)mv² + (1/2)kx². Since energy is conserved, this should equal the initial potential energy.

Wait, the initial displacement is x = -ρ. But since x squared is used in potential energy, the sign doesn't matter. So the initial potential energy is (1/2)k(ρ)^2. Alternatively, since x can be positive or negative, the maximum potential energy is when x is ±ρ.

So setting E = (1/2)kρ². Therefore, at any displacement x, (1/2)mv² + (1/2)kx² = (1/2)kρ².

Let me write that down:

(1/2)mv² + (1/2)kx² = (1/2)kρ².

I can multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the 1/2:

mv² + kx² = kρ².

Then, I can solve for v²:

mv² = kρ² - kx².

Factor out k on the right:

mv² = k(ρ² - x²).

So, v² = [k(ρ² - x²)] / m.

Which can be written as v² = (k/m)(ρ² - x²).

Looking at the options, option F is v² = (ρ² - x²)(k/m), which matches what I derived. Wait, but looking at the options, I need to check all possibilities.

Wait, option F is written as v² = (ρ² - x²)(k/m), which is correct. Let me double-check the options.

Option F: v² = (ho^2 - x^2) (k/m). Wait, the user wrote 'ho' but I think it's a typo and should be ρ. Because the initial displacement is -ρ, so the amplitude is ρ. So if 'ho' is a typo for ρ, then option F is correct.

Alternatively, looking at the other options: option A has (ho -x²), which doesn't look right. Option F's structure aligns with my result. So I think the correct answer is F.

The problem involves a spring-mass system where the acceleration is given as \( a(x) = -\frac{k}{m}x \), and the mass is released from rest at a displacement of \( x = -\rho \). To find the velocity as a function of displacement, we use conservation of mechanical energy. The total energy \( E \) is the sum of kinetic and potential energies. Initially, the mass is at rest, so all energy is potential: \( E = \frac{1}{2}k\rho^2 \). At any displacement \( x \), the energy is \( \frac{1}{2}mv^2 + \frac{1}{2}kx^2 \). Setting these equal gives:

\[
\frac{1}{2}mv^2 + \frac{1}{2}kx^2 = \frac{1}{2}k\rho^2.
\]

Multiplying through by 2 and solving for \( v^2 \) yields:

\[
v^2 = \frac{k}{m}(\rho^2 - x^2).
\]

This matches option F, which is written as \( v^2 = (\rho^2 - x^2)\frac{k}{m} \).

Answer: F
