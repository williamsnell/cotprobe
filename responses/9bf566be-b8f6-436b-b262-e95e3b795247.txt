Okay, so I have this question about Mr. Torres's stock and his total income from it for the year. Let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, the question says he owns 350 shares of Krescostock. Each share has a quarterly dividend of $1.20. Oh wait, a quarterly dividend that's paid four times a year, right? So that's once every three months. Also, there's an extra year-end dividend of $0.30 per share. Year-end usually means at the end of the year, so that's another dividend paid out.

So, the total income he gets would be from these dividends. Let me break it down.

First, let's calculate the regular quarterly dividend. Each share gets $1.20 every three months. Since he has a year, that's four quarters. So per share, the annual dividend would be 1.20 * 4 = $4.80. Wait, no, waitâ€”the question says each share has a quarterly dividend of $1.20, so that's $1.20 per quarter. So for a year, each share would get 4 * $1.20 = $4.80.

But wait, the question also adds an extra $0.30 per share as a year-end dividend. So the total per share would be 4.80 + 0.30 = $5.10 per share.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. So the regular dividend is $1.20 per share every quarter. So in a year, that would be 4 * 1.20 = $4.80 per share. Then, the extra dividend is $0.30 per share added at year-end. So per share, the total income is 4.80 + 0.30 = $5.10 per share.

Wait, but wait. The question says that the last year-end dividend is an extra, so maybe that's an additional payment. So for each share, the total is 4 * 1.20 + 0.30 = $4.80 + $0.30 = $5.10 per share.

Wait, but wait again. Because 4 quarters would be 4 * 1.20 = 4.80, plus the extra 0.30. So total per share is 5.10. So 350 shares would be 350 * 5.10.

Wait, but wait a minute. Is that the correct way to calculate it? Alternatively, maybe the regular dividend is $1.20 per share per quarter, and the extra is $0.30 per share only at the end. So for each share, the total would be 4 * 1.20 + 0.30 = 5.10.

Alternatively, perhaps the extra is a one-time payment at the end of the year. So for each share, the total is 4 * 1.20 (from the quarterly dividends) plus 0.30 (the extra dividend). So that would be 5.10 per share.

Wait, but let's think about it differently. The quarterly dividend is $1.20 per share. That's four times a year, so 1.20 * 4 = 4.80 per share. Then, the year-end dividend is an extra $0.30 per share, so in total, each share gives him 4.80 + 0.30 = 5.10 per share.

So for 350 shares, it's 350 * 5.10. Let me compute that. 350 * 5 is 1750, and 350 * 0.10 is 35. So 1750 +35 = 1785. So total income is $1,785. Wait, but let me check the options. Option H is $1,785, so that's an option.

But wait, let me double-check. Could there be a mistake in my calculation?

Wait, another approach: per share, the total is 4 * 1.20 (for the four quarters) plus 0.30. So that's 4.80 + 0.30 = 5.10 per share. So 350 *5.10 = 350 *5 + 350 *0.10 = 1750 +35 = 1785.

Looking at the options, H is $1,785. But wait, looking back at the options, let me see:

Options:

A: $1,920

B: $1,710

C: $1,470

D: $1,680

E: $1,595

F: $1,260

G: $1,890

H: $1,785

I: $2,000

J: $1,650

So H is the correct one. So the answer should be H: $1,785.

The total income from the stock is calculated by considering the quarterly dividend of $1.20 per share, which amounts to $4.80 per share over a year, plus an extra $0.30 per share at year-end. This totals $5.10 per share. For 350 shares, the total is 350 * 5.10 = $1,785.

Answer: H
