The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

This question refers to the following information.
"If it be conceded, as it must be by every one who is the least conversant with our institutions, that the sovereign powers delegated are divided between the General and State Governments, and that the latter hold their portion by the same tenure as the former, it would seem impossible to deny to the States the right of deciding on the infractions of their powers, and the proper remedy to be applied for their correction. The right of judging, in such cases, is an essential attribute of sovereignty, of which the States cannot be divested without losing their sovereignty itself, and being reduced to a subordinate corporate condition. In fact, to divide power, and to give to one of the parties the exclusive right of judging of the portion allotted to each, is, in reality, not to divide it at all; and to reserve such exclusive right to the General Government (it matters not by what department to be exercised), is to convert it, in fact, into a great consolidated government, with unlimited powers, and to divest the States, in reality, of all their rights, It is impossible to understand the force of terms, and to deny so plain a conclusion."
â€”John C. Calhoun, "South Carolina Exposition and Protest," 1828

Options:

A: The response of the Democratic-Republicans to the Alien and Sedition Acts.

C: The response of the American colonists to the British Stamp Act of 1765.

G: The response of the North to the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850.
H: The response of the Whigs to the annexation of Texas.

Okay, so I have this question about John C. Calhoun's "South Carolina Exposition and Protest" from 1828. The question is asking about the language of "protest" he used and which political position it's similar to, with options from A to J.

First, I need to understand what Calhoun was talking about in that document. From what I remember, Calhoun was a prominent statesman, and the Exposition and Protest was related to South Carolina's response to federal tariffs, particularly the Tariff of 1828, which was seen as detrimental to the Southern economy. Calhoun argued for states' rights and nullification, the idea that states could nullify federal laws that they deemed unconstitutional.

The passage provided mentions that Calhoun is discussing the division of sovereign powers between the General Government and the State Governments. He's emphasizing that states have the right to decide on infractions of their powers and that this right is essential to their sovereignty. If they can't judge such issues, they lose their sovereignty. He's essentially making the case for states' rights and against a consolidated federal power.

Looking at the options, I need to find which political position used similar protest language. Let's go through them one by one.

Option A: The response of the Democratic-Republicans to the Alien and Sedition Acts. That was during the John Adams presidency, where the Democratic-Republicans, led by Jefferson, opposed the acts. They did use protest language, but it was more about civil liberties and federal overreach in a different context.

Option B: The response of New England Federalists to the War of 1812. The Federalists were against the war and even considered secession, like the Hartford Convention. This involved protest against federal actions, but it's about a war, not about states' rights in the same way Calhoun is talking.

Option C: The response of the American colonists to the British Stamp Act of 1765. This is the famous case of "no taxation without representation," leading to the Revolution. The colonists protested British laws, which is a form of protest against perceived overreach, but again, more about taxation and representation rather than states' rights.

Option D: The response of the Jefferson administration to the Barbary pirates. This was about naval actions, so probably not related to states' rights protests.

Option E: The response of the South to the Missouri Compromise of 1820. The Missouri Compromise was about regulating slavery in new territories. The South was concerned about federal restrictions on slavery, which relates to states' rights but the protests were more about slavery than the sovereignty argument Calhoun made.

Option F: The response of the Confederacy to the election of Abraham Lincoln in 1860. The Confederacy seceded over states' rights and the fear of federal interference with slavery. This is a strong candidate because the Confederates used protest and secession as responses, similar to Calhoun's nullification argument.

Option G: The response of the North to the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850. The North opposed this law, which required returning escaped slaves, leading to actions like the Underground Railroad and protests against federal enforcement. This is more about opposing federal enforcement of slavery laws, not exactly the same as Calhoun's argument about state sovereignty.

Option H: The response of the Whigs to the annexation of Texas. The Whigs opposed the annexation for various reasons, including the potential to expand slavery, but this doesn't directly relate to the states' rights argument.

Option I: The response of Daniel Shays to fiscal policies in Massachusetts. This was the Shays' Rebellion, a protest against state taxation and economic policies. It's a protest against state actions, not federal, and more about economic grievances.

Option J: The response of supporters of Andrew Jackson to the "corrupt bargain" of 1824. Jackson's supporters, like Martin Van Buren, were upset about the election results and the perceived unfairness, leading to the rise of the Democratic Party. This was more about political succession and corruption, not states' rights.

Now, comparing all options, the most similar is Option F. Calhoun's argument for states' rights and nullification is akin to the Confederate stance against federal overreach, especially regarding issues like slavery. Both used protest language to assert their position against federal authority, though Calhoun's was in 1828, and the Confederacy's was in 1860. However, the underlying principle of state sovereignty and resistance to federal authority is the same.
