Answer:
    
<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out the minimum delta-v required to transfer a satellite from Earth's heliocentric orbit to Venus's orbit. Both orbits are circular and coplanar, and I should only consider the Sun's gravity. Hmm, I remember that in orbital mechanics, when moving between two circular orbits in the same plane, the most efficient way is to use a Hohmann transfer orbit. That's the elliptical orbit that touches both the original and target circular orbits. 

First, I need the velocities of Earth and Venus around the Sun. I think the formula for circular orbital velocity is v = sqrt(G*M / a), where G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the Sun, and a is the semi-major axis (which, for a circle, is just the radius).

I recall that Earth's average orbital radius is about 1 astronomical unit (AU), which is approximately 149.6 million kilometers. Venus is closer, around 0.72 AU from the Sun. Let me confirm: yes, Earth is at about 1 AU, Venus at roughly 0.72 AU.

So, the next step is to compute the velocities. Let's denote Earth's velocity as v_e and Venus's as v_v. Using the formula v = sqrt(G*M / a). But since both are around the Sun, I can compare their velocities using the ratio of square roots of their semi-major axes, because G and M are constants and will cancel out in the ratio.

So v_e = sqrt(1 AU) and v_v = sqrt(0.72 AU). Wait, more accurately, since velocity is inversely proportional to the square root of the radius. Because v = sqrt(G*M / a), so v is proportional to 1/sqrt(a). 

So for Earth, a_e = 1 AU, and Venus, a_v = 0.72 AU. 

The transfer orbit's semi-major axis, a_transfer, is the average of a_e and a_v. So a_transfer = (1 + 0.72)/2 = 0.86 AU.

In the Hohmann transfer, the satellite needs to change its velocity twice: first, to enter the transfer ellipse, and second, to match Venus's orbit at the other end.

The initial burn (from Earth's orbit to the transfer orbit) requires a velocity increase (or decrease, depending on direction) to enter the transfer ellipse. The velocity at Earth's orbit for the transfer is v_te. Similarly, at Venus's orbit, the velocity is v Tv.

Wait, I think the velocities at the perihelion and aphelion of the transfer ellipse are higher and lower than the target orbit. Wait no, the transfer ellipse has perihelion at Venus's orbit and aphelion at Earth's orbit. Or wait, no, the transfer from Earth to Venus would involve moving inward, so the transfer ellipse's perihelion is at Venus's orbit (0.72 AU), and aphelion at Earth's (1 AU). So the initial burn is from Earth's circular orbit to the transfer ellipse's aphelion point. Wait, no, when moving from a higher orbit to a lower one, you use the transfer ellipse with perihelion at the lower orbit. 

Wait, maybe I should think of it this way: To transfer from Earth's orbit (radius a_e) to Venus's orbit (a_v, smaller), the transfer ellipse has perihelion at a_v and aphelion at a_e. So the initial burn is at Earth's orbit, where the satellite is moving at v_e. To enter the transfer orbit, it needs to change velocity to the transfer ellipse's velocity at a_e, which is lower than v_e because it's moving towards the Sun. So the initial delta-v is the difference between v_e and the transfer velocity at a_e, which would be a decrease.

Wait, no, wait. The transfer from a higher orbit to a lower one involves a burn to slow down, so the delta-v is negative in that case. But I'm just calculating the magnitude here. So the initial velocity change is from v_e to v_transfer_apo, which is the velocity at the aphelion (Earth's orbit) of the transfer ellipse. Since the transfer ellipse has a semi-major axis of a_transfer = (a_e + a_v)/2 = (1 + 0.72)/2 = 0.86 AU.

The velocity at a point in an elliptical orbit can be found using the vis-viva equation: v^2 = G*M*(2/r - 1/a). So at Earth's orbit (r = a_e = 1 AU), the transfer velocity is v_te = sqrt[ G*M*(2/a_e - 1/a_transfer) ].

Similarly, the velocity at Venus's orbit (r = a_v = 0.72 AU) for the transfer ellipse is v_tv = sqrt[ G*M*(2/a_v - 1/a_transfer) ].

But since we're only interested in the ratio, perhaps we can express everything in terms of Earth's velocity. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to calculate the velocities in terms of Earth's velocity, which is about 29.78 km/s. But I'm not sure if I should look up exact values or if I can use the ratios.

Wait, let me try to compute the velocities. Let's denote a_e = 1 AU, a_v = 0.72 AU, a_t = (1 + 0.72)/2 = 0.86 AU.

At Earth's orbit (r = a_e = 1 AU):

v_te = sqrt[ (2/a_e) - (1/a_t) ) ] * sqrt(G*M) 

Similarly, we know that v_e = sqrt( G*M / a_e ), so v_e^2 = G*M / a_e → G*M = v_e^2 * a_e.

Substituting into v_te:

v_te^2 = (2/a_e - 1/a_t) * G*M = (2/a_e - 1/a_t) * v_e^2 * a_e

= v_e^2 * [ 2 - (a_e / a_t) ]

Because (2/a_e) * a_e = 2, and (1/a_t) * a_e = a_e / a_t.

So v_te^2 = v_e^2 [ 2 - (a_e / a_t) ]

Similarly, a_e / a_t = 1 / 0.86 ≈ 1.1628.

So 2 - 1.1628 ≈ 0.8372.

Thus, v_te = v_e * sqrt(0.8372) ≈ v_e * 0.915.

Since v_e is about 29.78 km/s, v_te ≈ 29.78 * 0.915 ≈ 27.19 km/s.

Wait, but that can't be right because Earth's orbital speed is about 29.78 km/s, and the transfer at Earth's orbit should be lower than that to move inward. So yes, 27.19 km/s is correct. The initial burn would require a decrease in velocity from 29.78 to 27.19 km/s, so delta-v would be 29.78 - 27.19 ≈ 2.59 km/s.

Then, at Venus's orbit, the transfer ellipse has a velocity v_tv. Let's compute that.

v_tv^2 = G*M*(2/a_v - 1/a_t)

Again, using G*M = v_e^2 * a_e, so:

v_tv^2 = (2/a_v - 1/a_t) * v_e^2 * a_e

= v_e^2 [ 2 a_e / a_v - a_e / a_t ]

Plugging in the numbers:

a_e = 1 AU, a_v = 0.72 AU, a_t = 0.86 AU.

2 a_e / a_v = 2 * 1 / 0.72 ≈ 2.7778.

a_e / a_t = 1 / 0.86 ≈ 1.1628.

So 2.7778 - 1.1628 ≈ 1.615.

So v_tv = v_e * sqrt(1.615) ≈ 29.78 * 1.271 ≈ 37.85 km/s.

Wait, that can't be right because Venus's orbital speed is lower than Earth's. Wait, no, wait a second. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Because the transfer ellipse's perihelion is at Venus's orbit, which is closer to the Sun, so the velocity there should be higher than Venus's circular velocity, because in an elliptical orbit, the velocity is highest at perihelion.

Wait, but the problem states that the satellite is already in Earth's orbit, and we want to place it into Venus's orbit. So the second burn is at Venus's orbit, where the transfer ellipse's velocity is v_tv. But Venus's circular velocity is lower than Earth's because it's closer to the Sun. Wait, no, wait: wait, actually, no, closer planets orbit faster. For example, Mercury is faster than Venus, which is faster than Earth. So Venus's circular velocity is higher than Earth's? No, wait, no. Wait, no, Earth's orbital period is about 365 days, Venus's is about 225 days. So using Kepler's third law, (a_v / a_e)^3 = (T_v / T_e)^2.

Wait, no, that's for the same M. So (a_v / a_e)^3 = (T_v / T_e)^2. So a_v = 0.72 a_e, so (0.72)^3 = (T_v / T_e)^2 → 0.373 ≈ (T_v / T_e)^2 → T_v ≈ T_e * sqrt(0.373) ≈ T_e * 0.61 → so Venus's year is about 0.61 * 365 ≈ 222 days, which matches what I know.

Now, the orbital velocity v is proportional to sqrt(a) / a^2, because v = sqrt(G*M/a). So v is proportional to 1/sqrt(a). So Earth's v_e is about 29.78 km/s. Venus's v_v is sqrt( (1 AU) / 0.72 ) * v_e. Because 1/sqrt(0.72) ≈ 1.162, so v_v ≈ 29.78 * 1.162 ≈ 34.6 km/s. Wait, that's higher than Earth's velocity, which makes sense because Venus is closer to the Sun, so it moves faster. So yes, Venus's orbital speed is higher than Earth's.

Wait, but the transfer ellipse's velocity at Venus's orbit (v_tv) is higher than Venus's circular velocity? Because in the transfer ellipse, at perihelion (Venus's orbit), the velocity is higher than the circular velocity at that radius. So for the second burn, the satellite arrives at Venus's orbit with velocity v_tv, which is higher than the circular velocity v_v. So to match Venus's circular orbit, the satellite needs to slow down, which requires a negative delta-v. The magnitude of that delta-v would be the difference between v_tv and v_v.

Wait, no, wait. The transfer orbit is an ellipse with perihelion at Venus's orbit and aphelion at Earth's. So when the satellite reaches Venus's orbit, it's moving faster than a circular orbit at that radius, so to enter a circular orbit around the Sun at Venus's radius, it needs to slow down. The delta-v required is v_tv - v_v.

Wait, but let me clarify: the satellite is moving along the transfer ellipse, so at perihelion (Venus's orbit), its velocity is higher than the circular velocity at that point. So to enter a circular orbit, the satellite must fire its engines in the opposite direction to lose speed, which will lower its velocity to match the circular orbit. So the delta-v for the second burn is (v_tv - v_v) negative, but the magnitude is the positive value.

Wait, but the question asks for the minimum delta-v required. So the total delta-v is the sum of the two burns: the first to enter the transfer orbit, and the second to circularize at Venus's orbit.

So let's compute each delta-v.

First, compute v_te (transfer orbit velocity at Earth's orbit):

v_te = sqrt( G*M * (2 / a_e - 1 / a_t) )

But using the earlier substitution, I found that v_te ≈ 27.19 km/s.

But wait, another approach is to compute the difference in velocities. The initial velocity is Earth's circular velocity, v_e = 29.78 km/s. The transfer orbit requires a velocity at Earth's location of v_te ≈ 27.19 km/s, so the delta-v is v_e - v_te ≈ 2.59 km/s. So that's the first burn.

Second, at Venus's orbit, the transfer velocity is v_tv ≈ 37.85 km/s (as per previous calculation, but that seems high because I thought Venus's orbital speed is about 34.6 km/s). Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me recalculate v_tv properly.

Using the vis-viva equation:

v^2 = G*M*(2/r - 1/a)

At Venus's orbit, r = a_v = 0.72 AU.

a_t is the semi-major axis of the transfer ellipse, which is 0.86 AU.

So,

v_tv^2 = G*M*(2/(0.72) - 1/0.86 )

But since G*M is the same as in Earth's orbit, and v_e^2 = G*M / a_e → G*M = v_e^2 * a_e.

So,

v_tv^2 = (v_e^2 * a_e) * (2/0.72 - 1/0.86 )

Calculate the terms:

2/0.72 ≈ 2.7778

1/0.86 ≈ 1.1628

So 2.7778 - 1.1628 = 1.615.

Thus,

v_tv^2 = v_e^2 * a_e * 1.615.

But wait, that can't be right because when a_e is 1 AU, a_v is 0.72 AU, and a_t is 0.86 AU.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in substitution. Wait, let me write it correctly.

v_tv^2 = G*M * (2/a_v - 1/a_t )

But G*M = v_e^2 * a_e, so:

v_tv^2 = v_e^2 * a_e * (2/a_v - 1/a_t )

Plugging in the numbers:

a_e = 1 AU, a_v = 0.72 AU, a_t = 0.86 AU.

So,

2/a_v = 2 / 0.72 ≈ 2.7778

1/a_t = 1 / 0.86 ≈ 1.1628

So 2/a_v - 1/a_t ≈ 2.7778 - 1.1628 = 1.615.

Thus,

v_tv^2 = v_e^2 * 1 AU * 1.615 = v_e^2 * 1.615.

So v_tv = v_e * sqrt(1.615) ≈ 29.78 km/s * 1.271 ≈ 37.85 km/s.

But earlier, I thought Venus's circular velocity is about 34.6 km/s, which is less than 37.85. So the transfer ellipse's velocity at Venus's orbit is higher than the circular velocity, meaning the satellite arrives there moving faster than needed for a circular orbit. So to enter a circular orbit, it must slow down by delta-v = v_tv - v_v.

So v_v is the circular velocity at Venus's orbit, which is sqrt(G*M / a_v ) = v_e * sqrt( a_e / a_v ) = 29.78 * sqrt(1 / 0.72 ) ≈ 29.78 * 1.162 ≈ 34.58 km/s.

So delta-v at Venus's orbit is 37.85 - 34.58 ≈ 3.27 km/s.

Wait, but that can't be right because the options are all in thousands of meters per second. Let me check the units. Oh, wait, no, because 3.27 km/s is 3270 m/s, which is option J (3800 m/s), but let me see.

Wait, but the total delta-v is the sum of the two burns: 2.59 km/s (first burn) + 3.27 km/s (second burn) = approximately 5.86 km/s. That's 5860 m/s, which would match option A (5800 m/s) or H (5275 m/s). But let me check the numbers again because I might have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the transfer velocity at Earth's orbit. Let me recalculate v_te.

v_te^2 = G*M*(2/a_e - 1/a_t )

Again, G*M = v_e^2 * a_e, so:

v_te^2 = v_e^2 * a_e * (2/a_e - 1/a_t )

= v_e^2 * (2 - a_e / a_t )

a_e / a_t = 1 / 0.86 ≈ 1.1628

So 2 - 1.1628 ≈ 0.8372.

Thus, v_te = v_e * sqrt(0.8372 ) ≈ 29.78 * 0.915 ≈ 27.19 km/s.

So delta-v at Earth: 29.78 - 27.19 ≈ 2.59 km/s.

At Venus's orbit, v_tv ≈ 37.85 km/s, and v_v ≈ 34.58 km/s, so delta-v is 37.85 - 34.58 ≈ 3.27 km/s.

Total delta-v: 2.59 + 3.27 ≈ 5.86 km/s → 5860 m/s. Looking at the options, option A is 5800 m/s and option H is 5275 m/s. So probably 5800 is the closest. But wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the velocities.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use more precise values for the orbital speeds. Let me look up the approximate orbital speeds of Earth and Venus.

Earth's orbital speed: about 29.78 km/s.

Venus's orbital speed: approximately 34.92 km/s.

Wait, that's higher than my earlier estimate. Hmm, perhaps I should use more accurate values.

Wait, let me check: the formula is v = sqrt( G*M / a ). Since G*M for the Sun is approximately 1.3271244e+20 m^3/s^2, and 1 AU is about 1.496e+11 meters.

So Earth's velocity: v_e = sqrt(1.3271244e20 / 1.496e11 ) ≈ sqrt(8.87e8 ) ≈ 29.78 km/s.

Venus's a is 0.723 AU, so 0.723 * 1.496e11 ≈ 1.082e11 meters.

v_v = sqrt(1.327e20 / 1.082e11 ) ≈ sqrt(1.225e9 ) ≈ 35.00 km/s.

So using more accurate numbers, v_v is approximately 35 km/s, and v_e is ~29.78 km/s.

So back to the transfer orbit:

a_t = (1 + 0.723)/2 = 0.8615 AU → 0.8615 * 1.496e11 ≈ 1.29e11 m.

First, compute v_te (transfer velocity at Earth's orbit, a_e = 1 AU):

v_te^2 = G*M*(2/a_e - 1/a_t )

= 1.327e20 * (2/(1.496e11) - 1/(1.29e11))

Compute 2/(1.496e11) ≈ 1.338e-11

1/(1.29e11) ≈ 7.752e-12

So 2/a_e - 1/a_t ≈ 1.338e-11 -7.752e-12 ≈ 5.628e-12

v_te^2 = 1.327e20 * 5.628e-12 ≈ 7.47e8 → v_te ≈ 27.33 km/s.

So delta-v at Earth: 29.78 - 27.33 ≈ 2.45 km/s.

Now, at Venus's orbit (a_v = 0.723 AU):

v_tv^2 = G*M*(2/a_v - 1/a_t )

= 1.327e20 * [ 2/(1.082e11) - 1/(1.29e11) ]

Compute 2/(1.082e11) ≈ 1.852e-11

1/(1.29e11) ≈ 7.752e-12

So 2/a_v - 1/a_t ≈ 1.852e-11 -7.752e-12 ≈ 1.077e-11

v_tv^2 = 1.327e20 * 1.077e-11 ≈ 1.429e9 → v_tv ≈ 37.80 km/s.

Venus's circular velocity is v_v ≈35 km/s.

So delta-v at Venus: 37.80 -35 = 2.80 km/s.

Total delta-v: 2.45 + 2.80 = 5.25 km/s → 5250 m/s, which is very close to option H: 5275 m/s.

But wait, my calculation gave 5250 m/s, and option H is 5275. That's pretty close. Maybe due to rounding errors in the a values.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use more precise a values. Let me check the exact semi-major axes.

Earth's semi-major axis: 1.000 AU.

Venus's semi-major axis: approximately 0.7233 AU.

So a_t = (1 + 0.7233)/2 ≈ 0.86165 AU.

Now, let's compute v_te and v_tv more accurately.

Compute v_te:

v_te^2 = G*M*(2/a_e - 1/a_t )

= 1.3271244e20 * (2/(1.496e11) - 1/(0.86165 * 1.496e11))

Calculate denominator for a_t: 0.86165 * 1.496e11 ≈ 1.2906e11 m.

So,

2/a_e = 2/(1.496e11) ≈ 1.338e-11 s²/m.

1/a_t = 1/(1.2906e11) ≈ 7.75e-12 s²/m.

So,

2/a_e - 1/a_t ≈ 1.338e-11 - 7.75e-12 = 5.63e-12 s²/m.

v_te^2 = 1.3271244e20 * 5.63e-12 ≈ 7.47e8 (m²/s²).

v_te = sqrt(7.47e8) ≈ 27350 m/s → 27.35 km/s.

So delta-v at Earth: 29780 m/s (29.78 km/s) -27350 = 2430 m/s.

Now, v_tv:

v_tv^2 = G*M*(2/a_v -1/a_t )

a_v = 0.7233 AU → 0.7233 *1.496e11 ≈ 1.082e11 m.

2/a_v = 2/(1.082e11) ≈ 1.852e-11 s²/m.

1/a_t = 7.75e-12 s²/m.

So,

2/a_v -1/a_t ≈ 1.852e-11 -7.75e-12 = 1.077e-11 s²/m.

v_tv^2 = 1.3271244e20 * 1.077e-11 ≈ 1.429e9 m²/s².

v_tv ≈ 37800 m/s.

Venus's circular velocity v_v = sqrt( G*M / a_v ) = sqrt(1.327e20 / 1.082e11 ) ≈ sqrt(1.225e9 ) ≈ 35 km/s → 35000 m/s.

So delta-v at Venus: 37800 -35000 = 2800 m/s.

Total delta-v: 2430 + 2800 = 5230 m/s.

Hmm, that's about 5230 m/s, which is very close to option H: 5275 m/s. The slight discrepancy might be due to more precise values of a_v and a_t.

Wait, but I think I may have made a mistake in the calculation of v_tv. Let me check again.

Wait, another approach: using the formula for the Hohmann transfer delta-v.

The total delta-v is the sum of the two burns:

delta-v = sqrt( G*M (2/a_e - 1/a_t) ) + sqrt( G*M (2/a_v - 1/a_t) ) - v_v.

Wait, no, perhaps a better approach is to compute each burn's delta-v.

First burn (from Earth's circular orbit to transfer orbit):

v_initial = v_e = sqrt( G*M / a_e )

v_final (transfer at Earth) = v_te = sqrt( G*M (2/a_e - 1/a_t) )

So delta-v1 = v_e - v_te.

Second burn (transfer at Venus to circular orbit):

v_transfer = v_tv = sqrt( G*M (2/a_v - 1/a_t) )

v_final (circular at Venus) = v_v = sqrt( G*M / a_v )

delta-v2 = v_tv - v_v.

So total delta-v = delta-v1 + delta-v2.

Plugging in the numbers:

a_e = 1 AU, a_v = 0.7233 AU, a_t = (1 +0.7233)/2 ≈ 0.86165 AU.

Compute delta-v1:

v_e = sqrt( G*M / a_e ) = 29.78 km/s.

v_te = sqrt( G*M (2/a_e - 1/a_t) ) = sqrt( G*M (2 - a_e/a_t) / a_e )

Wait, perhaps it's easier to use the formula in terms of v_e.

v_te = v_e * sqrt( (2/a_e - 1/a_t ) / (1/a_e) ) ) = v_e * sqrt(2 - a_e/a_t )

a_e/a_t = 1 / 0.86165 ≈ 1.1614.

So,

v_te = v_e * sqrt(2 - 1.1614) = v_e * sqrt(0.8386) ≈ 29.78 * 0.9158 ≈ 27.22 km/s.

delta-v1 = 29.78 -27.22 ≈ 2.56 km/s.

delta-v2: 

v_tv = sqrt( G*M (2/a_v -1/a_t ) )

= v_e * sqrt( a_e (2/a_v - 1/a_t ) )

Because G*M = v_e^2 a_e.

So,

v_tv = v_e * sqrt( (2 a_e / a_v ) - (a_e / a_t ) )

a_e / a_v = 1 / 0.7233 ≈ 1.382.

a_e / a_t = 1 / 0.86165 ≈ 1.1614.

So,

(2 * 1.382) -1.1614 = 2.764 -1.1614 = 1.6026.

v_tv = v_e * sqrt(1.6026) ≈ 29.78 * 1.266 ≈ 37.7 km/s.

v_v = sqrt( G*M / a_v ) = v_e * sqrt( a_e / a_v ) ≈ 29.78 * sqrt(1/0.7233) ≈ 29.78 * 1.161 ≈ 34.64 km/s.

delta-v2 = 37.7 -34.64 ≈3.06 km/s.

Total delta-v = 2.56 +3.06 =5.62 km/s → 5620 m/s.

Looking at the options, option C is 5600 m/s, which is close. But earlier calculation with precise a gave about 5230 m/s, which is closer to option H: 5275 m/s.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the approach. Another method is to compute the delta-v using the Hohmann transfer formula, which is:

delta-v = v_e - v_te + v_tv - v_v.

But perhaps a better way is to compute each part more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps using the ratio of velocities based on the semi-major axes.

The total delta-v is given by:

delta-v = sqrt( (2 * a_e / a_t ) -1 ) * v_e + sqrt( (2 * a_v / a_t ) -1 ) * v_e - v_v.

Wait, no, perhaps that's complicating it. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the following approach:

The Hohmann transfer delta-v is the sum of two burns: the first to enter the transfer ellipse, and the second to circularize at the destination.

The first burn's delta-v is:

delta-v1 = v_e - v_te,

where v_te = sqrt( G*M (2/a_e -1/a_t) ) → which we've calculated as about 27.22 km/s, leading to delta-v1 ≈2.56 km/s.

The second burn's delta-v is:

delta-v2 = v_tv - v_v,

where v_tv = sqrt( G*M (2/a_v -1/a_t) ) → about 37.7 km/s, and v_v ≈34.64 km/s, leading to delta-v2≈3.06 km/s.

So total delta-v ≈5.62 km/s →5620 m/s, which is option C:5600 m/s.

But earlier calculation with more precise a gave about5230 m/s. Hmm, perhaps the discrepancy comes from using more precise a values.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to use the formula for Hohmann transfer delta-v:

delta-v = sqrt( (2 * a_e / a_t ) - 1 ) * v_e + sqrt( (2 * a_v / a_t ) - 1 ) * v_e - v_v.

Wait, perhaps another approach is to compute the delta-v using the specific energy.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for a standard formula or known values.

Wait, actually, I remember that the delta-v for a Hohmann transfer from Earth to Venus is approximately 5.5 km/s. But the options are 5275 and 5600, so perhaps 5275 is the correct answer.

But I'm a bit confused because different methods are giving me different numbers. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute using the exact values.

Let me compute everything precisely.

Compute a_t = (1 + 0.7233)/2 = 0.86165 AU.

Compute a_e =1 AU =1.496e11 m.

a_v =0.7233 AU = 0.7233 *1.496e11 ≈1.082e11 m.

a_t =0.86165 *1.496e11 ≈1.290e11 m.

Compute v_te:

v_te^2 = G*M (2/a_e - 1/a_t )

G*M =1.3271244e20 m³/s².

So,

2/a_e = 2/(1.496e11) ≈1.338e-11 s²/m.

1/a_t =1/(1.290e11)≈7.752e-12 s²/m.

So,

2/a_e -1/a_t =1.338e-11 -7.752e-12 =5.628e-12 s²/m.

v_te^2 =1.3271244e20 *5.628e-12 ≈7.47e8 m²/s².

v_te≈27350 m/s.

delta-v1 =29780 -27350 =2430 m/s.

Compute v_tv:

v_tv^2 = G*M (2/a_v -1/a_t )

2/a_v =2/(1.082e11)≈1.852e-11 s²/m.

1/a_t =7.752e-12 s²/m.

2/a_v -1/a_t =1.852e-11 -7.752e-12 =1.077e-11 s²/m.

v_tv^2 =1.3271244e20 *1.077e-11 ≈1.429e9 m²/s².

v_tv≈37800 m/s.

v_v =sqrt(G*M/a_v )=sqrt(1.3271244e20 /1.082e11 )≈35000 m/s.

delta-v2=37800-35000=2800 m/s.

Total delta-v=2430+2800=5230 m/s.

So approximately 5230 m/s, which is very close to option H:5275 m/s.

But why does another approach give me 5600? Because perhaps that approach used a different a_v or a_t.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for the Hohmann transfer:

delta-v = sqrt( (2 * a_e / a_t ) -1 ) * v_e + sqrt( (2 * a_v / a_t ) -1 ) * v_e - v_v.

Wait, no, perhaps that's not the correct formula. Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is:

delta-v = sqrt( (2 * a_e / a_t ) -1 ) * v_e + sqrt( (2 * a_v / a_t ) -1 ) * v_e - v_v.

Wait, that can't be right because the units wouldn't match. Alternatively, perhaps using the formula in terms of the semi-major axes.

I think the correct approach is the one I did earlier, giving a total delta-v of approximately 5230 m/s, which matches option H:5275 m/s.

But looking at the options, option H is 5275 m/s, which is very close to 5230. So perhaps the correct answer is H.

To calculate the minimum $\Delta v$ required to transfer a satellite from Earth's heliocentric orbit to Venus's orbit using a Hohmann transfer, the process involves two burns: one to enter the transfer orbit and another to circularize at Venus's orbit. 

### Key Steps:
1. **Hohmann Transfer Orbit**: The transfer orbit is an ellipse with perihelion at Venus's orbit and aphelion at Earth's orbit. The semi-major axis of the transfer orbit is $a_t = \frac{a_e + a_v}{2}$, where $a_e = 1 \, \text{AU}$ (Earth's semi-major axis) and $a_v = 0.7233 \, \text{AU}$ (Venus's semi-major axis). Thus, $a_t \approx 0.86165 \, \text{AU}$.

2. **First Burn (Earth's Orbit to Transfer Orbit)**:
   - Earth's orbital velocity: $v_e \approx 29.78 \, \text{km/s}$.
   - Transfer velocity at Earth: $v_{te} = \sqrt{G M (2/a_e - 1/a_t)}$.
   - Using $G M = 1.3271244 \times 10^{20} \, \text{m}^3/\text{s}^2$, $a_e = 1.496 \times 10^{11} \, \text{m}$, and $a_t = 1.290 \times 10^{11} \, \text{m}$, $v_{te} \approx 27.35 \, \text{km/s}$.
   - $\Delta v_1 = v_e - v_{te} \approx 2.43 \, \text{km/s}$.

3. **Second Burn (Transfer Orbit to Venus's Orbit)**:
   - Transfer velocity at Venus: $v_{tv} = \sqrt{G M (2/a_v - 1/a_t)}$.
   - Using $a_v = 1.082 \times 10^{11} \, \text{m}$, $v_{tv} \approx 37.80 \, \text{km/s}$.
   - Venus's circular orbital velocity: $v_v = \sqrt{G M / a_v} \approx 35.00 \, \text{km/s}$.
   - $\Delta v_2 = v_{tv} - v_v \approx 2.80 \, \text{km/s}$.

4. **Total $\Delta v$**:
   - Total $\Delta v = \Delta v_1 + \Delta v_2 \approx 2.43 + 2.80 = 5.23 \, \text{km/s} \approx 5230 \, \text{m/s}$.

### Conclusion:
The calculated $\Delta v$ is approximately $5230 \, \text{m/s}$, which is closest to option **H: 5275 $\mathrm{~m}/\mathrm{s}$**.
