Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about RMA, which I think stands for Revolution in Military Affairs. The question is asking which phrase is NOT likely to indicate legitimacy in the new terminology of RMA. The options are A to J, and I need to pick the one that doesn't fit.

First, I should understand what RMA is about. From what I remember, RMA involves using advanced technology to improve military effectiveness. It's about making warfare more precise, less destructive, and more controlled. So terms related to precision, technology, and control are probably the ones associated with RMA.

Looking at the options:

A: Indiscriminate attack. Hmm, this sounds like attacking without targeting specific things, so it's random and not precise. RMA is supposed to make attacks more precise, so this might not be legitimate in RMA terms.

B: Precision target. That makes sense because precision targeting is a key part of RMA. It's about hitting specific targets accurately.

C: Guided missile. Definitely part of RMA. Guided missiles are precise and use technology to target.

D: Smart bomb. Also a RMA term. Smart bombs use guidance systems to hit specific targets, reducing collateral damage.

E: Precision-guided munition. Yep, that's exactly what RMA usesâ€”munitions guided precisely to minimize damage.

F: Intelligent warfare. This sounds a bit vague, but I think it relates to using AI and technology, which is part of RMA. So it's legitimate.

G: Strategic bombardment. This one I'm not so sure about. Strategic bombardment can refer to large-scale bombing campaigns, which might be more traditional. RMA focuses more on precision, so maybe this isn't as legitimate in new terms.

H: Collateral damage control. This is about controlling the damage to non-target areas, which is important in RMA to minimize harm, so it's legitimate.

I: Surgical strike. Surgical strikes are precise and targeted, so definitely part of RMA.

J: Stealth technology. This is about making weapons invisible to radar, allowing them to avoid detection and strike targets more effectively, so it's part of RMA.

So, the question is which phrase is NOT likely to indicate legitimacy. A: Indiscriminate attack is the opposite of what RMA is about. G: Strategic bombardment might also be questionable because it's more about large-scale bombing, which isn't as precise. But I'm not sure if strategic bombardment is entirely out of RMA or if it's still used but in a more controlled way.

Wait, RMA isn't just about precision; it's also about integrating different technologies and strategies. Strategic bombardment could be part of RMA if it's done with precision. But Indiscriminate attack is definitely not, as it's the opposite of precision and control.

So I think the answer is A: Indiscriminate attack.

The answer is A: Indiscriminate attack. RMA focuses on precision and control, so this phrase does not align with its principles.
