Okay, so I've got this DNA question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

The question is about the [(A + T)/(G + C)] ratio in different strands of a DNA molecule. There are three parts: (a), (b), and (c). I'll tackle each part step by step.

Starting with part (a): The given ratio for one strand is 0.2. I remember that in DNA, each strand is complementary to the other. That means the two strands have base pairs where one is the complement of the other. So, if one strand has a certain number of A's, the other will have T's, and vice versa.

In DNA, the amount of A in one strand equals the amount of T in the complementary strand, and similarly for G and C. So, if I have a ratio [(A + T)/(G + C)] = 0.2 for one strand, what does that mean for the complementary strand?

Let me denote the original strand as Strand 1 and the complementary as Strand 2.

For Strand 1: (A1 + T1)/(G1 + C1) = 0.2.

In Strand 2, the number of A's will be equal to the number of T's in Strand 1. Similarly, the number of T's in Strand 2 equals A1. For G and C, G2 = C1 and C2 = G1.

So, Strand 2's ratio would be (A2 + T2)/(G2 + C2) = (T1 + A1)/(C1 + G1).

Wait, that's the same as Strand 1's ratio. Because (A1 + T1) is the same as (T1 + A1), and (G1 + C1) is the same as (C1 + G1). So the ratio remains the same for Strand 2. Therefore, part (a)'s answer is 0.2.

Hold on, wait a second. No, wait. That can't be right because I think I might be mixing up the strands. Let me think again.

Wait, in a double-stranded DNA, the total (A + T) in both strands is equal to the total (A + T) in the other. So, for the entire DNA, (A + T) = (A' + T'), where ' denotes the complementary strand. Similarly for G and C.

Wait, no. Actually, in the entire DNA molecule, the total number of A's equals the total number of T's, and the total number of G's equals the total number of C's. So, the sum of A and T in both strands would be (A1 + T1) + (A2 + T2) = (A1 + T1) + (T1 + A1) = 2(A1 + T1). But maybe that's not the point here.

Wait, the question is about each individual strand. Let me clarify: For Strand 1, (A1 + T1)/(G1 + C1) = 0.2. For Strand 2, the (A2 + T2)/(G2 + C2) would be (T1 + A1)/(C1 + G1), which is the same as (A1 + T1)/(G1 + C1) because addition is commutative. So yes, Strand 2's ratio is also 0.2. So part (a) would have the same ratio, 0.2. Wait, but looking at the options, option D says (a) 0.2, (b)5, (c)1. Option I says (a)0.2, (b)0.2, etc.

Wait, but wait another moment. No, maybe I'm getting confused. Because the ratio for the complementary strand might actually be the reciprocal. Let me think again.

Wait, let's think in terms of percentages. Suppose in Strand 1, (A+T) is 20%, so (G+C) is 80%. Then in Strand 2, (A+T) would be 80% and (G+C) 20%, because in Strand 2, the A's are T's from Strand 1, and T's are A's from Strand 1. So if Strand 1 has (A+T)=20%, Strand 2 would have (A+T)=80% because (A+T) in Strand 2 is (T1 + A1), which is the same as (A1 + T1) in Strand 1, but that's 20%. Wait, no, no. Wait, no, actually, Strand 2's (A+T) would be equal to Strand 1's (T + A), which is the same as Strand 1's (A+T), so 20%. Oh wait, I'm getting myself confused.

Wait, let's take a numerical example. Suppose Strand 1 has 20 A's and 10 T's. So (A+T) =30. Then (G+C) would be (assuming total is 100), 70. So ratio is 30/70 ≈0.428... Wait, no, the given ratio is 0.2. So let's say (A+T)=20, (G+C)=80, so ratio is 0.25? Wait no, 20/(80) is 0.25, not 0.2. Hmm, maybe I should pick numbers to make it 0.2.

Let me make (A+T) = 2, and (G+C)=10. So ratio is 2/10=0.2. So Strand 1 has A= a, T= t, so a + t = 2. And G= g, C= c, so g + c =10.

In Strand 2, the complementary strand, A2 = T1 = t, T2 = A1 = a, G2 = C1 = c, C2 = G1 = g.

So in Strand 2, (A2 + T2) = t + a = a + t = 2. (G2 + C2) = c + g = g + c =10. So the ratio is 2/10=0.2 again. So Strand 2 has the same ratio as Strand 1. So for part (a), the answer is 0.2. That would mean options where part (a) is 0.2. Looking at the options, D says (a)0.2, (b)5, (c)1. Option I has (a)0.2, (b)0.2, (c)1.

Wait, but the question says part (a) is (A+T)/(G+C) for the complementary strand. So if the original strand is 0.2, the complementary is also 0.2. So part (a) is 0.2.

Now part (b): The 0.2 now refers to [(A + G)/(T + C)] for one strand. So for Strand 1, (A1 + G1)/(T1 + C1) =0.2. What is this ratio in the complementary strand?

In Strand 2, (A2 + G2)/(T2 + C2) = (T1 + C1)/(A1 + G1).

Because A2=T1, G2=C1, T2=A1, C2=G1.

So the ratio becomes (T1 + C1)/(A1 + G1) = (C1 + T1)/(A1 + G1).

But in Strand 1, (A1 + G1)/(T1 + C1) =0.2, so the reciprocal would be (T1 + C1)/(A1 + G1) =1/0.2=5.

So part (b) would be 5. So looking at the options, which option has (a)=0.2 and (b)=5? Option D says (a)0.2, (b)5, (c)1.

Now part (c): What is the ratio [(A + G)/(T + C)] in the double-stranded DNA? Since the DNA is double-stranded, the total (A+G) in both strands would be (A1 + G1) + (A2 + G2) = (A1 + G1) + (T1 + C1).

Similarly, (T + C) in both strands is (T1 + C1) + (T2 + C2) = (T1 + C1) + (A1 + G1).

Wait, no. Let me think again. For the entire DNA, (A1 + A2) = A_total, but wait, no: A_total = A1 + T2, because A2 = T1, and T2 = A1. So for the entire DNA, (A + T) would be A1 + T1 + A2 + T2 = A1 + T1 + T1 + A1 = 2(A1 + T1). Similarly for G and C.

Wait, but the question is about the ratio in the double-stranded DNA. Wait, no, the question states: "What is the ratio of [(A + G)/(T + C)] in double-stranded DNA in (a) and (b)?"

Wait, I might be misinterpreting. The question is a bit ambiguous. Wait, the way it's written: "What is the ratio of [(A + G)/(T + C)] in double-stranded DNA in (a) and (b)?"

Hmm, perhaps it's asking for the ratio in each case (a) and (b), but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe it's the overall ratio for the entire DNA.

Wait, but perhaps for the entire DNA, (A + G) is the sum of A and G in both strands, and similarly for (T + C).

Wait, but in double-stranded DNA, the total A's in both strands equals the total T's, and the total G's equals the total C's. So in the entire DNA, (A + G) would be equal to (T + C), because A_total = T_total and G_total = C_total. So (A + G)_total = T_total + C_total = (T + C)_total. Therefore, the ratio [(A + G)/(T + C)] would be 1.

So in part (c), regardless of the individual strand ratios, the double-stranded DNA would have a ratio of 1.

So putting it all together:

(a) 0.2

(b)5

(c)1.

Looking at the options, option D is (a)0.2, (b)5, (c)1. So the answer should be option D.

The question involves analyzing the base ratios in DNA strands. 

### Part (a): 
Given the ratio \((A + T)/(G + C) = 0.2\) for one strand, the complementary strand has the same ratio because the complementary bases (A ↔ T, G ↔ C) maintain the same proportions. Thus, the ratio for the complementary strand is also **0.2**.

### Part (b): 
If the ratio \((A + G)/(T + C) = 0.2\) for one strand, the complementary strand will have the reciprocal ratio due to the complementary nature of the bases. The complementary ratio is \(1/0.2 = 5\).

### Part (c): 
In double-stranded DNA, the total \((A + G)\) equals \((T + C)\) because \(A = T\) and \(G = C\) across strands. Therefore, the ratio \((A + G)/(T + C)\) is always **1**.

### Final Answer:
(a) 0.2, (b) 5, (c) 1.

**D**  
(a) 0.2, (b) 5, (c) 1
