Alright, so I have this multiple-choice question about Schelling's necessary conditions for compellence success. I'm a bit rusty on my international relations theory, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

First, I remember that Schelling wrote about compellence, which is the opposite of deterrence. Deterrence is about convincing someone not to do something by making the consequences too bad, while compellence is about convincing someone to do something by making the alternative too bad. So, in this case, the question is about what conditions Schelling said are necessary for compellence to succeed.

Looking at the options, they all list several conditions. I need to recall what Schelling emphasized. From what I remember, Schelling talked about the importance of a credible threat. If the threat isn't credible, the adversary won't take it seriously, so that's a key point. So, any correct option must include "threat must be credible."

Next, I think about the nature of the threat itself. Schelling said the threat should make non-compliance so unpleasant that the adversary prefers to comply. That means the threat needs to be sufficient to make non-compliance unbearable. So, looking at the options, I'm looking for "conveyed threat must be sufficient so as to make non-compliance unbearable."

Another point I remember is about giving the adversary sufficient time to comply. If the time is too short, the adversary might not be able to respond effectively, which could lead to failure. So, the correct option should include "adversary must be given sufficient time to comply with demand."

I also recall that Schelling discussed the idea that the coercer should assure the adversary that compliance won't lead to future demands. This is to prevent the adversary from fearing more requests after complying, which could undermine the current efforts. So, the option should have "coercer must assure adversary that compliance will not lead to future demands."

Additionally, Schelling mentioned that the conflict shouldn't be perceived as a zero-sum game. If both sides see it as a zero-sum situation, where one's gain is the other's loss, it can escalate tensions and make compellence harder. So, the correct answer should include "conflict must not be perceived as a zero-sum game."

Now, looking at the options:

Option A says the threat must make non-compliance bearable, which doesn't make sense because Schelling said the threat should make non-compliance unbearable. So A is out.

Option B mentions "coercer must not unduly threaten the adversary," but I think Schelling was more about making the threat credible and sufficient, not necessarily about not unduly threatening. Plus, B doesn't have the "unbearable" part, so probably not B.

Option C includes all the points I thought of: unbearable threat, credible, sufficient time, assurance no future demands, and not zero-sum. That looks promising.

Option D also has the unbearable threat, credible, time, but it says "compliance will lead to future demands," which is the opposite of what Schelling said. So D is incorrect.

Option E lacks some conditions, like the unbearable threat and the assurance part, so E is out.

Option F has the unbearable threat and credible, but it mentions insufficient time, which is wrong. So F is incorrect.

Option G includes the unbearable threat, credible, sufficient time, but the assurance part is about not using fear, which doesn't align with Schelling's points. So G is probably wrong.

Option H talks about unduly threatening and legitimacy, which I don't think are Schelling's main points here. So H is out.

Option I adds a condition about not including military intervention, which I don't recall Schelling specifying. So I is incorrect.

Option J has the unbearable threat, credible, but insufficient time, which is wrong. So J is out.

So, after going through each option, the correct one seems to be Option C. It includes all the necessary conditions: the threat must make non-compliance unbearable, it must be credible, the adversary must have enough time, the coercer assures no future demands, and the conflict isn't zero-sum.

The correct answer is **C**. Schelling's conditions for compellence success include a credible threat that makes non-compliance unbearable, sufficient time for the adversary to comply, assurance that compliance won't lead to future demands, and avoiding a zero-sum perception of the conflict.

**Answer: C**
