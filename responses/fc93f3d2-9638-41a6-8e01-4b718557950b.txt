Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about the decomposition of azomethane. Hmm, it's a first-order reaction, right? I remember that first-order reactions have a specific way of handling their rate equations. Let me think. The problem states that at 600 K, the concentration decreases to half its value in 30 minutes. So that's the half-life, right?

Wait, for a first-order reaction, the half-life is given by t₁/₂ = ln(2)/k. So the half-life here is 30 minutes. But I need to find out how much remains after 60 minutes. Oh, right, because 60 minutes is twice the half-life. So after one half-life, it's 50% remaining. After another half-life, another 50% of what's left would remain.

Wait, that's right. So each half-life reduces the concentration by half. So after 30 minutes, it's 50%. After another 30 minutes (total 60), it's 25%. Because 50% of the 50% is left. So the remaining amount is a quarter of the original.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm not mixing up the concepts. First-order reactions do have a constant half-life, so each half-life is the same duration. So if it's 30 minutes for the first half-life, then the next is another 30, making it 60 total. So initial concentration is, say, [A]₀. After 30 min, it's [A]₀/2. After 60, it's [A]₀/4.

So the percentage remaining is 25%, which is 1/4. Looking at the options, E is 1/4. So the answer should be E.

The problem involves the first-order decomposition of azomethane. For a first-order reaction, the half-life is constant and given by \( t_{1/2} = \frac{\ln(2)}{k} \). The half-life here is 30 minutes, meaning the concentration decreases by half every 30 minutes. After 60 minutes, which is two half-lives, the concentration is reduced to \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} \) of the original concentration. Therefore, 25% of the azomethane remains.

Answer: E
