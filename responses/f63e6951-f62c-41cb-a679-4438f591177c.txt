Question:

A wife was unhappily married to her husband, an alcoholic. When the husband got drunk, he would become abusive and beat the wife. During the course of their marriage, the beatings became more violent and more frequent. Unable to endure the physical abuse any longer, the wife hired a hit man to kill her husband. One night while the husband was asleep, the hit man entered the home with a key given to him by the wife and shot the husband to death. Afterward, the wife was prosecuted for murder as an accomplice. At trial, the prosecution presented the facts outlined above. Thereafter, the defense sought to have the judge instruct the jury that the wife acted in self- defense under the battered women's syndrome. Based on the given facts, should the judge give such an instruction to the jury?

Options:

A: Yes, because, on these facts, a reasonable jury could conclude that the wife acted in self- defense by using necessary force to protect herself from the husband's constant violent attacks.
B: Yes, because the wife was suffering from a psychological condition, battered women's syndrome, which justifies her actions.
C: No, because the wife had the opportunity to leave the house but instead chose to kill her husband.
D: Yes, because the wife had no other means to protect herself from the husband's constant violent attacks.
E: No, because even though the wife was the victim of spousal abuse, she could have avoided the danger by safely retreating.
F: Yes, because the wife was acting under duress due to constant physical abuse.
G: No, because the wife's belief in the necessity of deadly force in self-defense was unreasonable.
H: Yes, because a criminal defendant's Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial prohibits a court from refusing to submit affirmative defenses to the jury.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this legal question about self-defense and battered women's syndrome. Let me break it down step by step.

The scenario is a wife who's married to an abusive alcoholic husband. Over time, the beatings got worse and more frequent. She couldn't take it anymore, so she hired a hit man to kill her husband. The husband was asleep when the hit man shot him. Now, she's being prosecuted for murder as an accomplice. At trial, the defense wants the judge to instruct the jury on self-defense using the battered women's syndrome.

I remember that self-defense requires a few elements: the defendant must have a reasonable belief that they're in imminent danger of serious bodily harm, they have no other option but to use force to defend themselves, and the force used must be proportional to the threat faced.

Battered women's syndrome (BWS) is a recognized condition where a victim of ongoing domestic abuse may perceive their situation as inescapable and feel they have no choice but to act in self-defense. However, I think the application of BWS can vary by jurisdiction. Some states require that the victim actually attempted to escape the situation before self-defense can be claimed, especially when deadly force is involved.

Looking at the options:

Option A says yes because a reasonable jury could conclude she acted in self-defense. But wait, she hired someone to kill him while he was asleep, which isn't an immediate threat. So the immediacy might be an issue. She probably couldn't claim self-defense if the husband wasn't attacking her at that moment.

Option B suggests it's yes because of the psychological condition. But BWS alone might not be enough. The situation needs to fit the legal elements of self-defense, like immediate threat and no safe retreat.

Option C says no because she could have left. But she might have been unable to due to the husband's control or fear, which BWS addresses. However, some jurisdictions require a reasonable opportunity to retreat before using deadly force.

Option D is yes because she had no other means. But again, the timing is off. The husband was asleep, so she didn't need to use deadly force then.

Option E says no because she could have retreated safely. This is the "retreat" doctrine. Many places require that you try to escape safely before using deadly force. If she had the chance to leave, she might not be justified in killing him.

Option F says yes because of duress from the abuse. Duress usually involves being forced to commit a crime under threat of immediate harm. But hiring a hit man in advance might not fit the duress defense as the threat wasn't immediate when she acted.

Option G says no because her belief was unreasonable. But BWS can make the belief reasonable even if others wouldn't see it that way, depending on the jurisdiction.

Option H is about the Sixth Amendment, which I think is more about the right to a jury, not about self-defense instruction. So probably not relevant here.

So, putting it together: The key issue is whether she can claim self-defense. She hired someone to kill her husband while he was asleep. At that moment, he wasn't attacking her. Battered women's syndrome might help if she was in a situation where she reasonably feared for her life, but the act of hiring a hit man while he's asleep doesn't fit the immediacy requirement. Also, many places require that she tried to retreat or couldn't have safely done so before using deadly force. If she had the opportunity to leave, the self-defense argument might fail.

Looking at the options, E seems relevant. If she had the chance to safely retreat (like leaving the house), then she couldn't claim self-defense. So the judge shouldn't instruct on self-defense because she could have avoided the danger by retreating safely.

Wait, but in some jurisdictions, the "Castle Doctrine" allows for self-defense in one's home without the need to retreat. But the question doesn't specify that. Also, she wasn't present when the hit man acted; she had arranged it. So the immediacy and the actual act of defense might not be present.

So the correct answer is probably E: No, because she could have safely retreated.

The scenario involves a wife who hired a hit man to kill her abusive husband while he was asleep. The defense seeks a self-defense instruction based on battered women's syndrome. Self-defense requires a reasonable belief in imminent danger, no safe retreat, and proportional force. The husband was asleep, so the immediacy of danger was absent. Additionally, many jurisdictions require a reasonable opportunity to retreat before using deadly force. If the wife could have safely left, her self-defense claim fails. Therefore, the judge should not instruct on self-defense. 

Answer: E
