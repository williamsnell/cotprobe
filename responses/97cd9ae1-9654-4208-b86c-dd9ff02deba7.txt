Question:

A witness lived next door to a victim. Late one night, the witness overheard the victim scream, "The defendant, please don't do it!" The next day the victim was found dead in her bedroom. The defendant was arrested and charged with murdering the victim. At trial, the witness proposes to testify to the victim's statement. Upon objection by defendant's counsel, the court should rule the witness's testimony regarding the victim's statement

Options:

A: admissible as a past recollection recorded if the witness can confirm the statement was made.
B: admissible as a dying declaration if the jury determines that the victim believed that her death was imminent.
C: admissible as a dying declaration if the judge, by preponderance of the evidence, determines that the victim believed that her death was imminent.
D: inadmissible, because the probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.
E: inadmissible, because the statement was not made under oath.
F: inadmissible as hearsay not within any recognized exception.
G: inadmissible, because the statement is considered a character evidence.
H: admissible, because the statement is a present sense impression.
I: inadmissible, because the statement can lead to a character attack on the defendant.

Okay, so I've got this evidence question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The scenario is that a witness lived next door to the victim. One night, the witness heard the victim scream, "The defendant, please don't do it!" The next day, the victim was found dead in her bedroom. The defendant is charged with murder, and at trial, the witness wants to testify about the victim's statement. The defense objects, and the court has to decide whether the testimony is admissible.

The options are A through I, and I need to pick the correct one. Let me go through each option and think about the rules of evidence.

First, I should identify what kind of evidence this is. The witness is testifying about something the victim said, which is hearsay because it's an out-of-court statement offered for the truth of the matter asserted. So, the key is whether this falls under a recognized exception to the hearsay rule.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Admissible as a past recollection recorded. For this exception, the statement must be a record made at the time of the event by someone with knowledge, kept in the regular practice of their business. The witness isn't introducing a written record; they're testifying about what they heard. So this doesn't fit. The statement wasn't recorded; the witness is recounting it from memory. So A is probably incorrect.

Option B: Admissible as a dying declaration if the jury determines the victim believed death was imminent. Dying declarations are an exception under FRE 804(b)(2). The requirements are that the declarant must believe their death is imminent, and the statement concerns the cause or circumstances of death. Here, the victim was found dead the next day, so it's possible she knew she was dying. But the determination of whether she believed her death was imminent is usually for the judge, not the jury. Wait, no, I think the judge decides whether the conditions are satisfied, including the declarant's belief, by a preponderance of evidence. So B might be wrong because it says the jury determines it. That's probably not how it works. So B is incorrect.

Option C: Admissible as a dying declaration if the judge determines by preponderance that the victim believed death was imminent. This aligns with what I just thought. The judge makes the determination, not the jury. So C seems correct, but I need to check the other options.

Option D: Inadmissible because probative value is outweighed by prejudice. This is the balancing test under FRE 403. The statement is probably highly probative because it suggests the defendant was the cause. But is there a danger of unfair prejudice? Well, it directly implicates the defendant, but that doesn't necessarily make it inadmissible under 403 unless the prejudice is so severe as to outweigh the probative value. I don't think that's the case here. So D might not be the right choice.

Option E: Inadmissible because the statement wasn't made under oath. That's about another exception, like a former testimony exception. But dying declarations don't require the statement to be under oath. So E is incorrect.

Option F: Inadmissible as hearsay not within any exception. Well, if it's a dying declaration, it is within an exception. So F would be incorrect if the conditions are met, which seems possible.

Option G: Inadmissible because it's character evidence. The statement is about the defendant's actions, not about the victim's character. It's more about the circumstances of the crime. So G is incorrect.

Option H: Admissible as a present sense impression. Present sense impressions are under FRE 803(1), which require the statement to be made while perceiving an event or immediately thereafter. Here, the statement was made late one night, and the victim was found dead the next day. It's possible it was during the event, but the timing isn't clear. If the defendant was present and the victim was screaming, it might qualify. But I'm not sure. If it's a present sense impression, the witness could testify. But the more likely exception is the dying declaration, especially since the victim died shortly after. So H might not be the best option.

Option I: Inadmissible because it can lead to a character attack on the defendant. The statement itself is about the defendant's actions, so it's more about the defendant's conduct than his character. Plus, the statement is being offered to show that the defendant caused the victim's death, which is relevant. So I don't think I is correct.

So, going back, the key is whether the statement is a dying declaration. The judge must determine by a preponderance of evidence that the victim believed her death was imminent. If that's the case, the statement is admissible under 804(b)(2). Therefore, option C seems correct.

Wait, but in the scenario, the victim was found dead the next day. The statement was made on the night she died. Itâ€™s possible she knew she was about to die. So the judge would assess whether she had the requisite belief. If the judge finds it, then it's admissible as a dying declaration. So option C is the right choice.

The statement made by the victim, "The defendant, please don't do it!", qualifies as a dying declaration under Federal Rule of Evidence 804(b)(2). For this exception, the judge must determine by a preponderance of the evidence that the victim believed her death was imminent, which appears to be the case here given that she was found dead the next day. The other options either misapply the exceptions or fail to account for the correct evidentiary rule. 

Answer: C
