Question:

Ms. Edwards' disposable income (that is, her income after taxes have been paid) has risen from $19,000 to $20,000. Her expenditures have risen from $15,200 to $15,950. 1) What is her marginal propensity to consume? 2) What is her marginal propensity to save?

Options:

A: Marginal propensity to consume is .70, marginal propensity to save is .30
B: Marginal propensity to consume is .80, marginal propensity to save is .20
C: Marginal propensity to consume is .95, marginal propensity to save is .05
D: Marginal propensity to consume is .85, marginal propensity to save is .15
E: Marginal propensity to consume is .75, marginal propensity to save is .25
F: Marginal propensity to consume is .50, marginal propensity to save is .50
G: Marginal propensity to consume is .55, marginal propensity to save is .45
H: Marginal propensity to consume is .60, marginal propensity to save is .40
I: Marginal propensity to consume is .65, marginal propensity to save is .35
J: Marginal propensity to consume is 1.00, marginal propensity to save is 0.00

Okay, so I've got this economics problem here about Ms. Edwards' disposable income and her expenditures. I need to figure out her marginal propensity to consume (MPC) and her marginal propensity to save (MPS). Hmm, I remember that MPC is the fraction of additional income that a household consumes, and MPS is what's saved. They should add up to 1, right?

Let me look at the numbers. Her disposable income went from $19,000 to $20,000. So the increase in income is $1,000. Her expenditures went up from $15,200 to $15,950. That's an increase of $750.

Wait, so the change in income is $1,000, and the change in consumption is $750. So MPC is change in consumption over change in income. So MPC = 750 / 1000 = 0.75. Oh, so MPC is 0.75. That makes sense.

Since MPC plus MPS should equal 1, MPS would be 1 - 0.75 = 0.25. So the marginal propensity to save is 0.25.

Looking at the options, I need to find where MPC is 0.75 and MPS is 0.25. Let me check the options:

Option E says MPC is 0.75 and MPS is 0.25. That matches exactly. So the answer should be E.

The marginal propensity to consume (MPC) is calculated as the change in consumption divided by the change in income. Ms. Edwards' income increased by $1,000, and her consumption increased by $750. Therefore, MPC = $750 / $1,000 = 0.75. The marginal propensity to save (MPS) is the remainder, which is 1 - MPC = 0.25. The correct option is E.

Answer: E
