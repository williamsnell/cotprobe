Question:

A 37-year-old man with type 1 diabetes mellitus is admitted to the hospital because of inadequate control of his glucose concentrations for the past 2 months. Despite his poor control, he demands that he be discharged. He reports that he has had a 3-month history of fatigue, irritability, and feelings of hopelessness. He says that he has been noncompliant with his diabetic regimen, adding, "Sometimes I forget." He has been avoiding his family and friends because he is not in the mood to see them but admits that he is lonely. He did not get out of bed for 2 days, which prompted his wife to call an ambulance and have him admitted to the hospital. Prior to admission to the hospital, his only medication was insulin, although he often missed doses. He does not drink alcohol. He is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb); BMI is 36 kg/m2 . His temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 68/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 150/85 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. On mental status examination, he is tired and has a restricted affect. There is no evidence of suicidal ideation. Cognition is intact. His fasting serum glucose concentration is 120 mg/dL. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?

Options:

A: Start a diet and exercise regimen
B: Prescribe medication for depression
C: Begin a psychotherapy session
D: Insist on hospitalization against the patient's wishes
E: Adhere to the patient's wishes and discuss home-care options
F: Schedule neuropsychological testing
G: Seek a court order to appoint a legal guardian
H: Adhere to the patient's wishes on the condition that he agree to home nursing care
I: Conduct a full body physical examination
J: Initiate insulin therapy immediately

Alright, I'm trying to figure out the best next step for this patient. Let's break down the information given.

The patient is a 37-year-old man with type 1 diabetes. He's been admitted because his glucose control has been poor for two months. He's demanding discharge, which is concerning because he's not managing his condition well. He's had symptoms of fatigue, irritability, and hopelessness for three months. He's noncompliant with his diabetic regimen, sometimes forgetting doses. He's been avoiding family and friends, feeling lonely. He didn't get out of bed for two days, leading to his hospitalization.

His vitals are slightly elevated BP but otherwise okay. No physical abnormalities found. Mental status shows he's tired, restricted affect, no suicidal thoughts, but intact cognition. Fasting glucose is 120, which is a bit high but not critically so.

The options are from A to J, each suggesting a different next step.

Option A: Start diet and exercise. But he's noncompliant, so maybe not the immediate next step without addressing his mental state.

Option B: Prescribe medication for depression. He has symptoms of depression—fatigue, irritability, hopelessness. His noncompliance might be linked to this. Treating depression could help him manage his diabetes better.

Option C: Begin psychotherapy. Therapy could address the underlying issues, but maybe he needs more immediate help given his current state.

Option D: Insist on hospitalization against his wishes. He's insisting on discharge, but if he's a danger to himself or others, maybe. However, he has no suicidal ideation, so maybe not necessary unless there's a risk he'll get worse outside.

Option E: Adhere to his wishes with home care. If he's against hospitalization, but he's not safe at home, this might not be best. But he's lonely and not managing, so perhaps home care could help.

Option F: Schedule neuropsych testing. His cognition is intact, so maybe not necessary right now.

Option G: Legal guardian. Seems extreme unless he's completely unable to make decisions, which isn't clear yet.

Option H: Adhere to wishes with home nursing. This could provide support at home, but if he's noncompliant, maybe not enough.

Option I: Full physical exam. He had a normal physical exam, so probably not needed now.

Option J: Initiate insulin therapy. He's already on insulin but misses doses. Maybe adjusting the regimen, but the question is about the next step in management, which might involve adherence rather than starting something new.

Putting it together: He has symptoms of depression which are affecting his diabetes management. Noncompliance is a big issue here. His mental state is likely contributing to his poor control. So, treating the depression could help improve his adherence and overall health.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step is to prescribe medication for depression, which is option B.
</think>

The patient exhibits symptoms of depression, such as fatigue, irritability, and hopelessness, which likely contribute to his poor adherence to his diabetic regimen. While other options like diet, exercise, or home nursing might be beneficial, addressing the underlying depression is critical to improving his overall management of diabetes. Prescribing medication for depression can help alleviate his symptoms and enhance his ability to comply with his treatment plan.

Answer: B
