Okay, so I need to figure out the answer to this multiple-choice question about comparing the costs of two different insurance policies. The question is asking about the costs of a $5,000 20-year endowment policy versus a $5,000 20-year limited payment policy, both purchased at age 45. The options are A through J, with various dollar amounts.

First, I should understand what an endowment policy and a limited payment policy are. An endowment policy is a type of life insurance that pays out a lump sum after a certain period (the endowment period) if the insured is still alive. If the insured dies before the endowment period, the policy may pay out a death benefit. The premiums for an endowment policy are usually higher because they're meant to accumulate a significant sum at the end of the term.

On the other hand, a limited payment policy is a term life insurance policy where the premiums are paid for a certain period (like 20 years), and the policy provides a death benefit during that time. After the limited payment period, the policy typically doesn't renew unless there's a renewable option, but in this case, it's a 20-year policy, so after 20 years, the coverage ends.

Since the question is about the cost of each policy, I'm assuming it's asking for the annual or monthly premium. But the question doesn't specify, so I have to make an assumption. Usually, these questions refer to the annual premium unless stated otherwise.

Now, comparing the two policies: the endowment policy is more expensive because it's designed to build cash value over time, and it provides a death benefit or a lump sum upon reaching the end of the term. The limited payment policy, being a term life insurance, is generally cheaper because it only covers the death benefit during the term and doesn't accumulate cash value.

So, the endowment policy's cost (premium) would be higher than the limited payment policy's. Now, looking at the options, I need to see which options are higher and lower. Let me list the options with their values:

A: 182.45  
B: 125.75  
C: 233.35  
D: 300.20  
E: 160.65  
F: 99.99  
G: 46.67  
H: 210.10  
I: 75.50  
J: 50.90

Assuming we're looking for the endowment policy to be more expensive, let's consider that the endowment's premium would be higher, and the limited payment lower. Wait, but the question is comparing the costs, so perhaps it's asking which is more expensive, or maybe what is the cost of each? Wait, the question says "Compare the costs," but it's phrased as "each were to be purchased," so maybe it's asking for the difference in cost between the two policies.

Alternatively, perhaps it's asking for the premium amount for each policy, but without more context, I'm a bit unsure. Alternatively, maybe the question is about the initial cost, like the first-year premium.

Wait, but in reality, endowment policies typically have higher premiums because they build cash value. So the endowment would cost more per year. So, for the same coverage amount ($5,000), the endowment's annual premium would be higher than the limited payment policy.

Looking at the options, perhaps the endowment's premium is one of the higher numbers, and the limited payment is one of the lower ones.

But wait, the question says "Compare the costs of a $5,000 20-year endowment policy with a $5,000 20-year limited payment policy." So, it's comparing the two policies, each providing $5,000, but one is endowment, the other is limited payment. So, perhaps the endowment policy is more expensive.

So, the endowment policy's premium would be higher. But the question is, which option is the correct cost? Or is it the difference in cost between the two? Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the difference in the premiums. For example, if the endowment policy costs X and the limited payment costs Y, what is X - Y?

Alternatively, maybe the question is simply asking for the cost of each, but since the options are single numbers, perhaps it's the cost of the limited payment policy, which is cheaper, or the endowment, which is more expensive.

But the way the question is phrased: "Compare the costs... if each were to be purchased..." So perhaps it's asking for each policy's cost, but since the options are single numbers, maybe it's the cost of the limited payment, as endowment is more expensive and the options include both higher and lower numbers.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the total cost, but that would be 20 years multiplied by the annual premium. But without knowing the time value of money or interest rates, that's hard to calculate.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the monthly premium. But again, without knowing, it's tricky.

Wait, perhaps the question is from a textbook or a standard problem where the endowment policy's premium is higher than the limited payment. So, for example, if the endowment's premium is $210.10 and the limited payment is $125.75, then the endowment is more expensive.

But the options are single numbers. So the question must be asking which policy is more expensive, but the options are numerical. Wait, perhaps it's asking which option is the cost of the endowment, or which is the cost of the limited payment.

Alternatively, maybe the question is about the difference between the two. But without more information, it's challenging.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the total amount paid over 20 years. For example, if the endowment has an annual premium of, say, $182.45, over 20 years, that's $3,649. The limited payment might have a lower premium, say, $125.75, totaling $2,515. But that's speculative.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the monthly premium. For instance, if the endowment's monthly premium is $182.45, that would be an annual of around $2,190, which seems high. Similarly, the limited payment might be lower.

But I'm not sure. Maybe I should think about typical life insurance premiums. For a $5,000 policy, a term life limited payment (like 20-year term) might have a lower premium. For example, a 20-year term life for $5,000 coverage at age 45 might cost around $100 to $200 annually, depending on health and other factors.

An endowment policy, which also provides $5,000 but builds cash value, would have a higher premium. So, perhaps the endowment's premium is higher, say around $200 or more.

Looking at the options, the higher numbers are A:182.45, C:233.35, D:300.20, H:210.10. The lower ones are B:125.75, E:160.65, F:99.99, etc.

So, if the endowment is more expensive, let's say its premium is around $210.10 (option H), and the limited payment is around $125.75 (option B). But the question is to compare their costs, so perhaps the endowment is more expensive, so the answer would be one of the higher numbers if it's asking about the endowment's cost, or the lower number if it's about the limited payment.

But the question isn't asking which is more expensive; it's asking to compare the costs. So perhaps the question is asking for the difference between the two. For example, if endowment is $210.10 and limited is $125.75, the difference is $84.35, but that's not one of the options. Alternatively, the sum would be $335.85, which isn't an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the total premium paid over 20 years for each. So, endowment: 20 * premium, limited: 20 * premium.

But without knowing the exact premiums, it's hard. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the initial cost, like the first-year premium.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the monthly premium. For example, if the endowment's monthly premium is $182.45, that's about $2,190 annually, which seems high for a $5k policy.

Wait, maybe I should think about this differently. Let's consider that an endowment policy's premiums are higher because they're funding a future lump sum. So, for a 20-year endowment, the premiums would be higher than a 20-year term life policy.

So, if the endowment's annual premium is higher, and the question is asking for the cost of each, perhaps the endowment is one of the higher options, and the limited payment is a lower one.

But the question is phrased as "Compare the costs," so maybe it's asking for the difference. But without specific data, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the premium for each policy. For example, the limited payment policy's premium is lower, so the correct answer would be one of the lower options, like B:125.75 or E:160.65.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about which option is the most reasonable. For a $5,000 20-year term life policy, the annual premium for someone aged 45 might be around $100 to $200. So, looking at the options, B:125.75, E:160.65, F:99.99, I:75.50, J:50.90. These are all possible, but the endowment would be higher.

So, if the endowment's premium is higher, and the limited payment is lower, perhaps the endowment is around $200, and the limited is around $100. So, comparing the two, the endowment is more expensive.

But the question is asking to compare their costs, so maybe the answer is the endowment's cost, which is higher. But without knowing, perhaps the options include both. Alternatively, the question might be asking for the difference in cost between the two.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the total cost over 20 years. For example, if the endowment's annual premium is $182.45, over 20 years that's $3,649. The limited payment's premium might be $125.75, totaling $2,515. The difference would be around $1,134, which isn't an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the monthly cost. For example, if the endowment's monthly premium is $182.45, that's high. But maybe the limited payment is $125.75 monthly, which is about $1,509 annually.

But I'm not making progress. Maybe I should look for the most common answer. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is H:210.10 for the endowment, which is higher, and B:125.75 for the limited payment. But the question is comparing both, so perhaps the endowment is more expensive, so the answer would be the endowment's cost, which is higher.

Wait, but the options are single numbers. So perhaps the question is asking which is the correct cost for one of the policies. Without more context, it's hard to say. Alternatively, perhaps the question is from a textbook where the endowment's annual premium is $210.10, making option H the correct answer.

Alternatively, perhaps the limited payment policy's premium is $125.75, making option B correct.

But I'm not sure. Given that the endowment is more expensive, perhaps the correct answer is the higher number, so H:210.10.

The question involves comparing the costs of a $5,000 20-year endowment policy and a $5,000 20-year limited payment policy purchased at age 45. An endowment policy typically has higher premiums due to its cash value accumulation feature, whereas a limited payment policy (term life insurance) is generally cheaper as it only provides coverage during the term. Based on the options provided, the endowment policy is expected to have a higher premium. Among the higher options, H: $210.10 stands out as a plausible annual premium for the endowment policy, making it the most reasonable choice.

Answer: H
