Take up the White Man's burden—
Send forth the best ye breed—
Go bind your sons to exile
To serve your captives' need;
To wait in heavy harness,
On fluttered folk and wild—
Your new-caught, sullen peoples,
Half-devil and half-child.
...
Take up the White Man's burden—
The savage wars of peace—
Fill full the mouth of Famine
And bid the sickness cease;
And when your goal is nearest
The end for others sought…
Watch sloth and heathen Folly
Bring all your hopes to naught.

Okay, so I have this question about Rudyard Kipling's poem "The White Man's Burden" from 1899. I'm supposed to figure out what Kipling's conception of the British imperial mission is based on the provided poem. The answer choices are A through J, and I need to pick the best one.

First, I'll read the poem again to understand the themes and the tone. The poem starts with the lines "Take up the White Man's burden—" which immediately sets a tone of obligation or duty. The speaker is exhorting someone to take on this burden, which seems to be about the responsibilities of empire.

Looking at the next lines: "Send forth the best ye breed— / Go bind your sons to exile / To serve your captives' need;" Here, it's talking about sending the best people to serve others, but the wording "bind your sons to exile" suggests it's not a voluntary or easy task. They're being sent to serve their captives, which implies that the captives are in some way dependent or less developed.

The lines "To wait in heavy harness, / On fluttered folk and wild— / Your new-caught, sullen peoples, / Half-devil and half-child." Paint a picture of the British as burdened with responsibility, wearing "heavy harness," which could symbolize the weight of their duty. The description of the people as "new-caught, sullen" and "half-devil and half-child" seems to depict them as primitive or uncivilized, in need of guidance.

Further on, the poem says, "Take up the White Man's burden— / The savage wars of peace— / Fill full the mouth of Famine / And bid the sickness cease;" This part talks about dealing with savage conflicts and alleviating suffering, like ending famine and disease. It suggests that the burden includes not just guiding but also protecting and improving the lives of others.

Then, "And when your goal is nearest / The end for others sought… / Watch sloth and heathen Folly / Bring all your hopes to naught." Here, the poem warns that despite the best efforts, the mission might fail because of the laziness (sloth) and foolishness (heathen Folly) of the people being helped. This indicates that the burden is tough because the outcome isn't guaranteed.

Looking at the options:

A: an attempt to bring civilization to uncivilized peoples. This seems to fit because the poem talks about the "savagewars of peace" and bringing order, which could imply civilizing.

B: a mission to educate and enlighten. The poem doesn't explicitly mention education or enlightenment, more about burden and service.

C: a task that is doomed to fail. The poem does mention that despite efforts, hopes might be dashed, but it's not entirely negative—it's more about the difficulty.

D: a glorious, religious responsibility. There's no strong religious theme here, more about duty and burden.

E: a profitable endeavor for the empire. The poem doesn't talk about profits; it's about duty and burden.

F: a difficult but necessary task. This seems to fit because the poem uses words like "burden" and "harness," indicating difficulty, but also a sense of duty.

G: a necessary evil for the good of the empire. It's more about burden for others, not necessarily evil.

H: a ruthless exercise of power. The poem doesn't present it as ruthless, more as a duty.

I: a hopeless task with no purpose. While the poem acknowledges difficulty, it's presented as a necessary mission, not hopeless.

J: a burden that should be willingly undertaken. The poem uses "burden," but the tone is about duty, not necessarily willingness.

So, the best fit seems to be F: a difficult but necessary task. The poem emphasizes the heavy responsibility and the challenges, but also presents it as something that must be done despite the difficulties.

The poem "The White Man's Burden" by Rudyard Kipling presents the British imperial mission as a weighty responsibility, filled with challenges. The speaker urges taking up this burden, highlighting the duty to serve and uplift others, despite the difficulties involved. The portrayal of the mission as both demanding and obligatory aligns with the idea of it being a difficult yet necessary task.

Answer: F
