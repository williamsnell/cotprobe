Okay, so I need to figure out what percentage of the world population practices open defecation as of 2020. Hmm, I'm not exactly sure about the exact number, but I remember that open defecation is a significant issue in many parts of the world, especially in developing countries.

Let me think. I've heard that a large portion of people in countries with lower development indices don't have access to proper toilets. I think India has a particularly high rate of open defecation. But I'm not sure about the global percentage.

Wait, I remember reading somewhere that around a billion people practice open defecation. Let me check the world population. As of 2020, the world population is about 7.8 billion. So if a billion people practice open defecation, that would be roughly 12.8%. But wait, that's not one of the options exactly. The closest options are J:13% and E:15%. 

Alternatively, maybe the number is a bit lower. I think some progress has been made in recent years. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) target ending open defecation, so perhaps the number has decreased from previous years. I'm not sure if it's exactly 13% or maybe 11% or 9%.

Another thought: I've heard that in 2015, the estimate was around 1 in 10 people, which would be 10%. But by 2020, maybe it's slightly lower. So 9% or 11% could be possible. But I'm not certain.

Wait, I think the World Health Organization or UNICEF reports might have specific data. Let me try to recall. I think the number is around 13-15%, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, I might be confusing it with the percentage of people without access to proper sanitation, which is higher than open defecation.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct figure is 11%, which is option C. I'm not entirely confident, but I think that's the number I've heard before. Or maybe it's 15%, which is E. I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, another angle: I remember that in 2017, the global estimate was around 892 million people practicing open defecation, which is about 12%. So that would be close to 12%, but the options don't have that. The closest is J:13% and E:15%. Maybe it's rounded up to 13% or down to 12%, but since 12 isn't an option, I have to choose between J and E.

Alternatively, maybe the number is 11%, which is option C. I think I might be mixing up the numbers. I'm a bit stuck here. Wait, perhaps I should consider that the percentage has been decreasing. If in 2015 it was about 10%, maybe by 2020 it's around 9%, which is option D. But I'm not sure if it's that low.

I think I'll go with the 13% figure because I remember a report mentioning it being around that number. So I'll choose J:13%.

The answer is J:13%.
