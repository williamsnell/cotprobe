Okay, I need to find the Z-scores for the given raw scores of 115, 134, and 99. The random variable X is normally distributed with a mean (μ) of 118 and a standard deviation (σ) of 11. 

I remember that the Z-score formula is Z = (X - μ) / σ. So I'll apply this formula to each of the raw scores.

First, for X = 115:
Z = (115 - 118) / 11
That's (-3) / 11, which equals approximately -0.27. So the Z-score is about -0.27.

Next, for X = 134:
Z = (134 - 118) / 11
That's 16 / 11, which is approximately 1.45. So the Z-score here is +1.45.

Lastly, for X = 99:
Z = (99 - 118) / 11
That's (-19) / 11, which is approximately -1.73. 

Wait, let me double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. 

115: 115-118=-3, divided by 11 is indeed -0.27. 

134: 134-118=16, divided by 11 is around 1.45. 

99: 99-118=-19, divided by 11 gives about -1.73. 

So the Z-scores are -0.27, +1.45, and -1.73. Now I'll look at the options:

Option F is -.27, 1.45, -1.73. That matches exactly. Option E has positive scores for all, which isn't right because two of them are below the mean. Option B has the first two wrong signs. Option F seems correct.

The Z-scores for the raw scores 115, 134, and 99 are calculated using the formula Z = (X - μ) / σ. 

- For 115: Z = (115 - 118) / 11 ≈ -0.27  
- For 134: Z = (134 - 118) / 11 ≈ 1.45  
- For 99: Z = (99 - 118) / 11 ≈ -1.73  

These correspond to option F: -.27, 1.45, -1.73.

F
