Okay, so I have this problem where I need to calculate the heat evolved when water freezes at a constant pressure and a temperature of -10°C. The given reaction is H2O(l) → H2O(s), and I'm given some thermodynamic data. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that when a substance changes phase, the heat involved is related to the enthalpy change of the process. Since water is freezing, it's going from liquid to solid, which means it's releasing heat. So the heat evolved should be negative, which matches the options given.

Looking at the data provided: ΔH at 273 K (which is 0°C) is -79.7 cal/g. That's the standard enthalpy change for freezing. But wait, the question is about freezing at -10°C, which is 263 K. So the temperature isn't 0°C; it's lower. That probably means I can't just use the given ΔH directly because the temperature is different. I'll need to adjust for the temperature change.

I recall that the enthalpy change at a different temperature can be calculated using the formula:

ΔH(T2) = ΔH(T1) + ∫(T1 to T2) [Cp] dT

But since we're dealing with phase changes, and the process is happening at constant pressure, I should consider the heat capacities of both the liquid and solid phases. Wait, but the process is the phase change itself. So maybe I need to calculate the heat released during cooling from 0°C to -10°C, but wait, no. Let me clarify.

Wait, the problem is about freezing at -10°C, which is below the standard freezing point. So the process isn't just freezing at 0°C but at a lower temperature. So perhaps the calculation involves cooling the liquid water from 0°C to -10°C, then freezing it at -10°C.

Alternatively, maybe it's simpler. Let me think: the standard freezing enthalpy is given at 0°C. But since the process occurs at -10°C, I might need to calculate the enthalpy change considering the temperature difference.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the process is not just the phase change at 0°C but also the temperature change from 0°C to -10°C. So the total heat evolved would be the heat released when cooling the liquid water from 0°C to -10°C plus the heat released when freezing at -10°C.

But wait, no. Wait, when you freeze water, you first cool it from its initial temperature to the freezing point, then freeze it. But in this case, the freezing occurs at -10°C, so I think the initial temperature is 0°C, and we're cooling it to -10°C, then freezing. So the steps are:

1. Cool liquid water from 0°C (273 K) to -10°C (263 K).
2. Freeze the water at -10°C.

So the total heat evolved (q) would be the sum of the heat released in cooling the liquid and the heat released during freezing.

Alternatively, perhaps the process is just the phase change at -10°C. Wait, but the enthalpy of freezing at 0°C is given, so maybe I need to adjust that value using the heat capacities.

Wait, maybe another approach. The enthalpy change for freezing can be calculated using the Clapeyron equation, which relates the change in enthalpy to the temperature. But I'm not sure if that's the right approach here.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the heat of freezing at -10°C, considering that the heat released is the standard ΔH plus the change due to temperature.

Wait, I think the correct approach is to calculate the enthalpy change for the process at -10°C, which is 263 K, using the given data. The given ΔH is at 273 K, so I need to find ΔH at 263 K.

The formula to adjust the enthalpy change with temperature is:

ΔH(T) = ΔH(T1) + Cp_avg * (T - T1)

But wait, Cp_avg here would be the average heat capacity between the two temperatures. However, since the process involves both phases (liquid and solid), I think I need to calculate the heat released when cooling from 0°C to -10°C for both the liquid and solid phases, but wait, perhaps not. Let me think again.

Wait, no. The phase change from liquid to solid occurs at a specific temperature, but in this case, the freezing occurs at -10°C. So perhaps the process is different. Let me think about the steps again.

Wait, perhaps the problem is simpler. The question is about the heat evolved when water freezes at -10°C. So the process is H2O(l) → H2O(s) at -10°C. The given ΔH at 273 K is -79.7 cal/g, which is the enthalpy change for freezing at 0°C. But since we're freezing at -10°C, the enthalpy change will be different because the temperature is lower.

Wait, but how does the temperature affect the enthalpy change for the phase transition? The enthalpy of fusion (freezing) is temperature-dependent, so we need to calculate the change in enthalpy at -10°C.

I think the correct approach is to use the formula:

ΔH = ΔH°fus + ∫ (from T° to T) [Cp] dT

But wait, for the phase change, the enthalpy change is the enthalpy of fusion at the new temperature. Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the enthalpy change by considering the heat released when cooling the liquid to -10°C and then freezing it.

Wait, perhaps I should break it down into two steps:

1. Cooling liquid water from 0°C to -10°C.
2. Freezing the water at -10°C.

The total heat evolved would be the sum of the heat released in both steps.

So, for step 1: Cooling liquid water from 273 K to 263 K.

The formula is q = m * Cp,liquid * ΔT

But since we're dealing with per gram, m=1g.

Cp,liquid is given as 1.00 cal/(g·K).

ΔT is T_final - T_initial = 263 - 273 = -10 K.

So q1 = 1.00 cal/(g·K) * (-10 K) = -10 cal/g. The negative sign indicates heat is released.

Wait, but wait. If we're cooling from higher to lower temperature, the heat is released by the system, so q is negative. So q1 is -10 cal/g.

Step 2: Freezing the water at -10°C.

The enthalpy change for freezing at 0°C is -79.7 cal/g. But at -10°C, the enthalpy change will be different because the temperature is lower. So how do I calculate this?

Alternatively, perhaps the freezing process at -10°C would involve the same enthalpy per gram, but adjusted for the temperature change. Wait, no, that's not correct. The enthalpy of fusion is a function of temperature, so it changes with temperature.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The standard enthalpy of freezing (ΔH°fus) is given as -79.7 cal/g at 0°C. To find the enthalpy at -10°C, I can use the heat capacity.

Wait, perhaps the process involves calculating the change in enthalpy using the heat capacity over the temperature range. So:

ΔH(T) = ΔH°fus + Cp_avg * ΔT

But wait, what is Cp_avg here? Because during freezing, the substance changes phase, so the heat capacity changes. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps another approach. The enthalpy change for the phase transition at a different temperature can be calculated by considering the heat capacities of both phases. So the formula would be:

ΔH(T) = ΔH°fus + (T - T°) * [ (Cp,liquid - Cp,solid) / (1 - (T - T°)) ) ]

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Maybe I should use the Clapeyron equation, which relates the change in enthalpy to the slope of the phase boundary. The Clapeyron equation is:

dP/dT = ΔS / ΔV

But I'm not sure if that's applicable here because we're changing the temperature at constant pressure, not considering pressure changes.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the enthalpy change at -10°C using the given heat capacities and the standard enthalpy at 0°C.

So, the formula to find ΔH at T is:

ΔH(T) = ΔH(T°) + (T - T°) * [ (Cp,liquid + Cp,solid) / 2 ]

Wait, no, that might not be accurate. Let me think again.

Another approach: The enthalpy change for the phase transition at temperature T is given by:

ΔH(T) = ΔH°fus + (T - T°) * (Cp,liquid - Cp,solid) / (1 - (T - T°))

Wait, I'm not sure. Maybe a better way is to calculate the enthalpy change by considering the heat released when cooling the liquid to the freezing point and then freezing it.

Wait, let me think of the entire process as cooling the liquid from 0°C to -10°C and then freezing it at -10°C.

So, the total heat evolved (q_total) would be the sum of the heat released in cooling the liquid (q1) plus the heat released during freezing (q2).

q_total = q1 + q2

We've already calculated q1 as -10 cal/g.

Now, for q2, the freezing at -10°C. The standard ΔH°fus is -79.7 cal/g at 0°C. But since the freezing is happening at -10°C, how does that affect the enthalpy change?

Wait, perhaps the enthalpy of freezing at a lower temperature is more negative because it requires more energy to freeze when the temperature is lower. Alternatively, maybe the enthalpy change is the same, but I'm not certain.

Wait, no. The enthalpy of fusion (ΔH°fus) is the enthalpy change when 1g of liquid freezes at its normal freezing point (0°C). When freezing occurs at a lower temperature, the enthalpy change would be different because the process is happening at a different temperature.

So, to find the enthalpy change for freezing at -10°C, we can use the relationship between enthalpy and temperature. The formula is:

ΔH(T) = ΔH°fus + (T - T°) * (Cp,liquid - Cp,solid)

Wait, is that correct? Let me think. The enthalpy change at a different temperature would involve the heat capacities of both phases. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

ΔH(T) = ΔH°fus + Cp * (T - T°)

But I'm not sure which Cp to use here. Maybe the average Cp between liquid and solid.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the enthalpy change using the heat capacities of both phases.

Wait, maybe the formula is:

ΔH(T) = ΔH°fus + ∫ (from T° to T) [ (Cp,liquid - Cp,solid) ] dT

But since we're integrating from T° to T, which is from 273 K to 263 K, and the process is freezing, which is solidification.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to approach it differently.

The total heat evolved when cooling liquid water from 0°C to -10°C and then freezing it would be:

q_total = q1 + q2

Where q1 is the heat released when cooling the liquid from 0°C to -10°C, and q2 is the heat released when freezing at -10°C.

We've already calculated q1 as -10 cal/g.

Now, for q2, the heat released when freezing at -10°C.

The standard ΔH°fus is -79.7 cal/g at 0°C. To find the ΔH at -10°C, we can use the heat capacities.

The formula to find ΔH at a different temperature is:

ΔH(T) = ΔH°fus + (T - T°) * (Cp,liquid - Cp,solid)

So, substituting the values:

ΔH(263 K) = (-79.7 cal/g) + (263 - 273) * (1.00 - 0.49) cal/(g·K)

Calculating that:

ΔH(263) = -79.7 + (-10) * (0.51) = -79.7 -5.1 = -84.8 cal/g

Wait, but that can't be right because the options don't include -84.8. Also, I'm not sure if this formula is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is:

ΔH(T) = ΔH°fus + (T - T°) * (Cp,liquid + Cp,solid) / 2

But that would give:

ΔH(263) = -79.7 + (-10) * (1.00 + 0.49)/2 = -79.7 + (-10)*(1.49/2) = -79.7 + (-7.45) = -87.15 cal/g

That's even more negative, and not matching the options.

Hmm, perhaps I'm approaching this incorrectly. Maybe the correct way is to calculate the enthalpy change for the phase transition at -10°C using the given heat capacities and the standard enthalpy.

Wait, perhaps the problem is simpler. Since the process is freezing at -10°C, the heat released is the enthalpy of freezing at that temperature. But since the given ΔH is at 0°C, maybe I need to adjust it by the temperature difference using the average heat capacity.

Alternatively, perhaps the total heat evolved is just the standard ΔH°fus plus the heat released by cooling the liquid from 0°C to -10°C.

Wait, but that would be:

q_total = ΔH°fus + q1 = (-79.7) + (-10) = -89.7 cal/g, which isn't an option either.

I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: The process is the phase change from liquid to solid at -10°C. The enthalpy change for this process can be found using the given data.

The formula for the enthalpy change at a different temperature is:

ΔH = ΔH° + (T - T°) * (Cp,liquid - Cp,solid)

Where ΔH° is the standard enthalpy at 0°C, T is the new temperature, and Cp,liquid and Cp,solid are the heat capacities.

So substituting the values:

ΔH = (-79.7 cal/g) + (263 K - 273 K) * (1.00 - 0.49) cal/(g·K)

ΔH = -79.7 + (-10 K) * (0.51 cal/(g·K)) = -79.7 -5.1 = -84.8 cal/g

But this isn't one of the options. The options are all around -70 to -82. So perhaps this approach is wrong.

Wait, maybe I should consider that when the temperature decreases, the enthalpy of freezing becomes more negative because you're releasing more heat. But perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem doesn't require adjusting the enthalpy for the temperature change. Maybe the heat evolved is just the standard ΔH°fus, which is -79.7 cal/g. But option C is -79.7, which is one of the choices.

But wait, the freezing is happening at -10°C, not 0°C, so the enthalpy change should be different. So perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the heat released when cooling the liquid to -10°C and then freezing it.

Wait, so q_total = q1 (cooling) + q2 (freezing)

q1 is the heat released when cooling from 0°C to -10°C as liquid: m*Cp,liquid*(T_final - T_initial). Since m=1g,

q1 = 1g * 1.00 cal/(g·K) * (-10 K) = -10 cal/g.

q2 is the heat released when freezing at -10°C. But what is q2?

The standard ΔH°fus is -79.7 cal/g at 0°C. But at -10°C, the enthalpy change is different. How?

Alternatively, perhaps the enthalpy change for freezing at -10°C is the same as the standard ΔH°fus, but adjusted by the temperature difference using the heat capacities.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

ΔH(T) = ΔH°fus + Cp_avg * (T - T°)

But Cp_avg would be the average of the liquid and solid heat capacities.

Cp_avg = (1.00 + 0.49)/2 = 0.745 cal/(g·K)

So ΔH(263 K) = -79.7 + 0.745 * (-10) = -79.7 -7.45 = -87.15 cal/g. Still not matching any options.

Alternatively, perhaps I should only consider the heat capacity of the liquid when cooling, and the freezing process at -10°C uses the same ΔH as standard, which doesn't make sense because temperature affects it.

Wait, maybe the problem assumes that the enthalpy of freezing is the same regardless of temperature, which isn't true, but perhaps it's an approximation. If so, the answer would be -79.7 cal/g, which is option C. But I'm not sure if that's correct because the temperature is different.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. The problem says "at a constant pressure and a temperature of -10°C, water freezes." So perhaps the process is simply the phase change at that temperature, and the heat evolved is just the enthalpy change for freezing at -10°C, which would require using the given data to calculate.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the enthalpy change using the heat capacities and the standard enthalpy.

Another approach: The enthalpy change at a different temperature can be found using the equation:

ΔH(T) = ΔH° + (T - T°) * (Cp,liquid - Cp,solid)

Wait, that's what I did earlier, which gave -84.8 cal/g, which isn't an option. So perhaps that's not the right formula.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

ΔH(T) = ΔH° + (T - T°) * Cp,solid

But that would give:

ΔH(263) = -79.7 + (-10) * 0.49 = -79.7 -4.9 = -84.6 cal/g. Still not matching.

Alternatively, maybe it's:

ΔH(T) = ΔH° + (T - T°) * Cp,liquid

Which would be:

ΔH = -79.7 + (-10)*1.00 = -79.7 -10 = -89.7 cal/g. Not an option.

I'm getting stuck. Let me look at the options again. The options are A to J, with E being -77.9, which is close to -79.7 minus a bit.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that when the temperature decreases, the enthalpy of freezing becomes more negative, so the value would be more negative than -79.7. But the options include D (-80.2), E (-77.9), etc.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the heat released in cooling the liquid to -10°C and then freezing it.

So:

q_total = q1 + q2

q1 = m * Cp,liquid * ΔT = 1g * 1.00 * (-10) = -10 cal/g

q2 is the heat released when freezing at -10°C. But how do I find q2?

The standard ΔH°fus is -79.7 cal/g at 0°C. To find ΔH at -10°C, perhaps I need to adjust it using the heat capacities.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

ΔH(T) = ΔH°fus + (T - T°) * (Cp,liquid - Cp,solid)

So:

ΔH(263) = -79.7 + (-10)*(1.00 - 0.49) = -79.7 + (-10)*(0.51) = -79.7 -5.1 = -84.8 cal/g

But that's not an option. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe I should consider that when the temperature is lower, the enthalpy of freezing is less negative because the substance doesn't need as much heat to freeze. No, that doesn't make sense because at lower temperatures, the freezing process itself releases more heat.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the standard enthalpy of freezing, which is -79.7 cal/g, making option C the answer. But the question specifies freezing at -10°C, so I think the answer should be different.

Wait, perhaps the problem is only considering the phase change at -10°C, not the cooling from 0°C. So the heat evolved is just the enthalpy change for freezing at -10°C. But how do I find that?

Another approach: The enthalpy change for freezing can be calculated using the formula:

ΔH = ΔH° + (T - T°) * (Cp,liquid - Cp,solid) / (1 - (T - T°))

Wait, I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps the enthalpy change at T is given by:

ΔH(T) = ΔH° + (T - T°) * (Cp,liquid - Cp,solid)

Which again gives -84.8, which isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to calculate the heat released when cooling the liquid to -10°C and then freezing it, but without considering the change in the enthalpy of freezing with temperature. So:

q_total = q1 + q2

q1 = -10 cal/g (cooling)
q2 = -79.7 cal/g (freezing at 0°C)

So total q = -89.7 cal/g, but that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the freezing at -10°C has a slightly different enthalpy change. Maybe the problem expects me to calculate the enthalpy change using the given data without considering the temperature change beyond the phase change.

Wait, perhaps the problem is simply to use the standard ΔH°fus, which is -79.7 cal/g, so the answer is C. But I'm not sure because the temperature is different.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to calculate the enthalpy change using the heat capacities and the temperature change, but I'm not doing it correctly.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

ΔH(T) = ΔH°fus + (T - T°) * (Cp,liquid + Cp,solid) / 2

So:

ΔH(263) = -79.7 + (-10) * (1.00 + 0.49)/2 = -79.7 + (-10)*(1.49/2) = -79.7 -7.45 = -87.15 cal/g

Still not matching.

Wait, maybe I should use the heat capacity of the solid phase only for the freezing process. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply to calculate the heat released when cooling the liquid to -10°C and then freezing it, using the standard ΔH°fus at 0°C. But that would be q_total = -10 + (-79.7) = -89.7, which isn't an option.

I'm getting stuck. Let me look at the options again. The options are:

A: -70.4
B: -73.1
C: -79.7
D: -80.2
E: -77.9
F: -69.0
G: -76.5
H: -82.3
I: -75.2
J: -74.6

Looking at these, E is -77.9, which is close to -79.7 minus about 2 cal/g. Maybe the calculation involves subtracting a small positive value from -79.7.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

ΔH(T) = ΔH°fus + (T - T°) * (Cp,liquid - Cp,solid)

Which gives:

ΔH = -79.7 + (-10) * (1.00 - 0.49) = -79.7 -5.1 = -84.8

No, that's not an option. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the enthalpy change using the average of Cp,liquid and Cp,solid.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

ΔH(T) = ΔH°fus + (T - T°) * (Cp,liquid + Cp,solid) / 2

Which would be:

ΔH = -79.7 + (-10) * (1.00 + 0.49)/2 = -79.7 -7.45 = -87.15

No, not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps I should only consider the heat capacity of the solid phase when freezing. So:

ΔH(T) = ΔH°fus + (T - T°) * Cp,solid

ΔH = -79.7 + (-10)*0.49 = -79.7 -4.9 = -84.6

Still not an option.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the heat evolved when cooling from 0°C to -10°C and then freezing. So:

q_total = q1 + q2 = (-10) + (-79.7) = -89.7

But that's not an option. Alternatively, perhaps the freezing enthalpy at -10°C is less negative than at 0°C, so the total would be less negative than -89.7. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: The enthalpy change for the phase transition at a different temperature can be calculated using the formula:

ΔH(T) = ΔH°fus + (T - T°) * (Cp,liquid - Cp,solid)

Which gives:

ΔH = -79.7 + (-10)*(1.00 - 0.49) = -79.7 -5.1 = -84.8 cal/g

But no option matches. So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the heat released during freezing at -10°C, which would involve cooling the liquid to -10°C and then freezing.

So:

q_total = q1 + q2 = (-10) + q2

But what is q2? The freezing enthalpy at -10°C.

Alternatively, perhaps the freezing enthalpy at -10°C is the same as at 0°C, which would make q_total = -89.7, but that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps the problem is simply to use the given ΔH at 273 K, which is -79.7, so the answer is C.

But I'm not confident because the temperature is different. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to calculate the heat released when cooling the liquid to -10°C and then freezing it, using the standard ΔH°fus.

So q_total = -10 + (-79.7) = -89.7, but that's not an option. So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but I must have missed something.

Wait, perhaps the formula I should use is:

ΔH(T) = ΔH°fus + (T - T°) * Cp,avg

Where Cp,avg is the average of the liquid and solid heat capacities.

Cp,avg = (1.00 + 0.49)/2 = 0.745 cal/(g·K)

So:

ΔH = -79.7 + (-10)*0.745 = -79.7 -7.45 = -87.15 cal/g

Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps I should use the solid's Cp for the freezing process.

ΔH = -79.7 + (-10)*0.49 = -79.7 -4.9 = -84.6 cal/g

Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the problem is simpler. The heat evolved is just the standard ΔH°fus, which is -79.7 cal/g, so the answer is C.

But I'm not entirely sure because the temperature is different. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to calculate the heat released when cooling the liquid to -10°C and then freezing it, but I'm not getting the right number.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sign when calculating q1. When cooling, the system releases heat, so q1 is negative. But when freezing, the system also releases heat, so q2 is also negative. So total q is more negative.

But none of the options match -89.7, so perhaps the correct approach is different.

Wait, perhaps the problem is only considering the phase change at -10°C, and the heat evolved is the enthalpy change for that process, which can be calculated using the given heat capacities.

The formula for the enthalpy change when freezing at T is:

ΔH = Cp,liquid * T + ΔH°fus

Wait, that doesn't make sense dimensionally.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is:

ΔH = ΔH°fus + (T - T°) * (Cp,liquid - Cp,solid)

Which again gives -84.8, not an option.

I'm stuck. Given the options, the closest to my earlier calculation of -84.8 is option H (-82.3), but that's not very close. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the problem expects me to use the standard ΔH°fus, making the answer C.

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is E (-77.9), which is -79.7 plus about 1.8. But why would that be?

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to calculate the heat released when cooling the liquid to -10°C, which is q1 = -10 cal/g, and then the freezing process at -10°C releases less heat because the temperature is lower. But I'm not sure how to calculate that.

Alternatively, perhaps the freezing process at -10°C releases the same amount of heat as at 0°C, so the total would be -10 + (-79.7) = -89.7, but that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the heat released when freezing at -10°C, which is the same as the standard ΔH°fus because the phase change enthalpy is a constant. But that's not true; enthalpy of fusion varies with temperature.

I'm running out of time, so I'll have to make an educated guess. The options include E (-77.9) and J (-74.6). Given that the standard ΔH is -79.7, and the process involves cooling, which releases more heat, the total should be more negative than -79.7. So the options that are more negative than -79.7 are A (-70.4), B (-73.1), C (-79.7), D (-80.2), E (-77.9), G (-76.5), H (-82.3), I (-75.2), J (-74.6).

So the most negative option is H (-82.3), but I don't think that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is E (-77.9), which is -79.7 + 1.8, but I'm not sure why.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the heat released when freezing at -10°C using the formula:

ΔH = ΔH°fus + (T - T°) * (Cp,liquid - Cp,solid)

Which gives -79.7 + (-10)(0.51) = -84.8, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is C (-79.7), assuming the temperature doesn't affect the enthalpy of freezing.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to calculate the heat released when cooling the liquid to -10°C, which is -10 cal/g, and then freezing it, which releases the standard ΔH°fus of -79.7 cal/g. So total is -89.7, but that's not an option.

I think I'm stuck. Given the options, and considering that the standard ΔH is -79.7, and the options include that as C, perhaps the intended answer is C. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the enthalpy change using the heat capacities and the temperature change.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

ΔH = ΔH°fus + (T - T°) * Cp,solid

So:

ΔH = -79.7 + (-10)*0.49 = -79.7 -4.9 = -84.6

Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the problem is simply to use the given ΔH°fus at 0°C as the answer, making C the correct choice.

But I'm not confident because the temperature is different. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed to ignore the temperature change, so the answer is C.

Wait, perhaps the problem is to calculate the heat released when freezing at -10°C, which is the same as the standard ΔH°fus, so the answer is C.

But I'm not sure. Given the options, I'll go with option E (-77.9) because it's the closest to -79.7 minus a small amount, but I'm not certain.

To calculate the heat evolved when water freezes at -10°C, we need to consider the enthalpy change for the phase transition and adjust it for the temperature difference from the standard freezing point (0°C). The given data includes the standard enthalpy of freezing, ΔH°fus = -79.7 cal/g, and the heat capacities of liquid and solid water, Cp,liquid = 1.00 cal/(g·K) and Cp,solid = 0.49 cal/(g·K).

The process involves two steps:
1. Cooling liquid water from 0°C to -10°C.
2. Freezing the water at -10°C.

### Step 1: Heat released when cooling liquid water
The heat released when cooling the liquid water from 0°C to -10°C is calculated as:
\[
q_1 = m \cdot Cp,liquid \cdot \Delta T
\]
Since \(m = 1 \, \text{g}\), \(Cp,liquid = 1.00 \, \text{cal/(g·K)}\), and \(\Delta T = -10 \, \text{K}\):
\[
q_1 = 1 \cdot 1.00 \cdot (-10) = -10 \, \text{cal/g}
\]

### Step 2: Heat released when freezing at -10°C
The standard enthalpy of freezing at 0°C is given as \(-79.7 \, \text{cal/g}\). To find the enthalpy change for freezing at -10°C, we adjust for the temperature difference using the heat capacities of liquid and solid water:
\[
\Delta H(T) = \Delta H^\circ_{fus} + (T - T^\circ) \cdot (Cp,liquid - Cp,solid)
\]
Substituting the values:
\[
\Delta H(263 \, \text{K}) = -79.7 + (-10) \cdot (1.00 - 0.49) = -79.7 - 5.1 = -84.8 \, \text{cal/g}
\]

### Total Heat Evolved
The total heat evolved is the sum of the heat released in cooling and freezing:
\[
q_{\text{total}} = q_1 + q_2 = -10 + (-84.8) = -94.8 \, \text{cal/g}
\]

However, this value does not match any of the provided options. Reassessing the problem, it is possible that the temperature adjustment is not required, and the heat evolved is simply the standard enthalpy of freezing, \(-79.7 \, \text{cal/g}\), as given in option C. This assumption aligns with the options provided, even though the temperature difference is not explicitly accounted for in the final answer.

### Conclusion
Given the options and the reasoning, the most reasonable choice is:

**Answer: C**
