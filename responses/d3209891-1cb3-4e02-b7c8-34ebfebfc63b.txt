The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

Assume this question takes place in a "lien theory" state. A woman and her co-habiting partner share a property as joint tenants with the right of survivorship. He has run up debts that he did not tell her about, and so he uses his interest in the property to secretly get a mortgage from the bank. When he dies, the bank attempts to execute on the mortgage. Can it do so? Apply the majority view on this issue.

Options:

A: No, although the mortgage destroyed the joint tenancy, the bank has to get a deed of trust in order to execute on jointly owned property.
B: No, the bank cannot execute on the mortgage because the property was jointly owned and one partner cannot unilaterally mortgage the property without the other's consent.
C: No, the bank cannot execute on the mortgage because the woman has the right of survivorship, which overrides the partner's debts.
D: Yes, the bank can execute on the mortgage because the partner's debt is considered a lien on the property, which overrides the joint tenancy.
E: Yes, the bank can execute on the mortgage because the partner used his interest in the property as collateral for the loan.
F: Yes, the bank can execute on the mortgage because the joint tenancy is considered severed when one partner incurs a debt without the knowledge of the other.
G: Yes, the bank got title to the property by virtue of the mortgage, which destroyed the joint tenancy, and it can execute on its lien.
H: Yes, the mortgage was the equivalent of a deed of trust and the joint tenancy was severed by the mortgage lien, giving the bank unfettered legal authority to execute on its mortgage.
I: No, the mortgage lien could not destroy the joint tenancy, and when the partner dies, the property passes by operation of law to the surviving joint tenant.
J: No, the bank cannot execute on the mortgage because the majority view in a "lien theory" state is that a mortgage does not sever a joint tenancy.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this legal question about joint tenancy and mortgages. Let me start by breaking down what the question is asking.

The scenario is in a "lien theory" state. I remember that in some states, a mortgage is considered a lien on the property rather than a conveyance of title. So in lien theory states, the borrower keeps the legal title, and the mortgage is just a lien. That might be important because the question is about whether the mortgage affects the joint tenancy.

The woman and her partner are joint tenants with the right of survivorship. That means if one dies, the other automatically gets the entire property. Now, the partner took out a secret mortgage without telling her. He used his interest in the property as collateral. When he dies, the bank wants to execute on the mortgage. Can they?

I think the key here is whether the mortgage can affect the joint tenancy. In joint tenancy, each tenant has an undivided interest, and the right of survivorship is a key feature. So if one tenant incurs a debt, can that debt affect the other's interest?

In a lien theory state, a mortgage is a lien, not a transfer of title. So when the partner took out the mortgage, he didn't transfer his interest; he just put a lien on it. Now, in some states, a lien might not sever the joint tenancy. But I'm not sure about the majority view.

Under the common law, a mortgage by one joint tenant would not sever the tenancy because the mortgage is considered a lien, not a transfer. But I think some jurisdictions have held that a mortgage can sever the joint tenancy, especially if it's a lien theory state. Wait, no, in lien theory, the mortgage is a lien, so maybe it doesn't sever the joint tenancy.

Wait, the majority view is what's being asked. So I need to recall what the majority rule is. I think the majority rule is that a mortgage by one joint tenant does not sever the joint tenancy. Because the mortgage is just a lien, and the interest remains with the joint tenant. So when the partner dies, the woman takes the property by survivorship, and the lien (mortgage) would attach to her interest. But does that mean the bank can execute?

Wait, but if the mortgage doesn't sever the joint tenancy, then upon death, the woman owns the property, and the bank's lien would be on her interest. But can the bank foreclose on her interest? I'm a bit confused here.

Another angle: in a lien theory state, the mortgagee (bank) has a lien, not a possessory interest. So when the partner dies, the property passes to the woman by survivorship. The bank's lien would now attach to her interest. But in some states, the lien might not be valid against the survivor because the joint tenancy's right of survivorship operates to transfer the interest outside of probate, but does it also protect against liens?

Wait, I think that in a joint tenancy, the right of survivorship is so strong that it even defeats liens. So even if one tenant has a lien against their interest, upon their death, the other tenant takes the whole property free of the lien because the lien was only on the deceased's interest, and the survivor's interest is separate. Or does the lien attach to the property as a whole?

Hmm, I'm getting a bit tangled. Let me think about the options. The options are from A to J, and I need to pick the correct one.

Looking at the options, option C says no because the woman has the right of survivorship, which overrides the debt. Option J says no because in a lien theory state, the mortgage doesn't sever the joint tenancy. Option I also says no because the mortgage can't destroy the joint tenancy, and the property passes to the survivor.

Wait, but in a lien theory state, the mortgage is a lien. So if the mortgage doesn't sever the joint tenancy, then when the partner dies, the woman gets the property by survivorship, and the bank's lien might not affect it because the lien was only on the deceased's interest, which is extinguished upon death. Or does the lien continue against the property as a whole?

I think the majority view is that a mortgage by one joint tenant does not sever the joint tenancy. So when the partner dies, the woman takes the property, and the bank's mortgage lien survives, but only against the deceased's interest. So upon death, the woman's interest is free of the lien because the lien was only on the deceased's share. Wait, but liens typically attach to the property itself, not just a share.

Alternatively, maybe the bank can foreclose on the entire property because the mortgage was on the partner's interest, but since the property is joint, the lien might affect the entire property. But I'm getting stuck.

Wait, another approach: in a joint tenancy, each tenant has an undivided interest. If one tenant mortgages their interest, in a lien theory state, the mortgage is a lien on their interest. But since it's joint, does the lien affect the entire property or just their share? Upon death, the survivor takes the whole property, so does the lien attach to the whole property or just the deceased's share, which is now gone?

I think the lien would only attach to the deceased's interest. So when the partner dies, the woman takes the property free of that lien because the lien was only against his interest, which is extinguished. Therefore, the bank can't execute against the property because the woman's interest is protected by survivorship.

So looking at the options, option C says no because the woman's right of survivorship overrides the debt. Option I says no because the mortgage couldn't destroy the joint tenancy, and the property passes to the survivor.

Wait, but the question is about whether the bank can execute on the mortgage. If the mortgage was a lien on the partner's interest, and upon death, that interest is extinguished and the woman takes the whole property, then the bank's lien would only be against the deceased's interest, which is gone. So the bank can't foreclose on the property because the woman's interest is not encumbered.

Alternatively, maybe the mortgage as a lien does affect the entire property. But in joint tenancy, the right of survivorship would make the property pass without the lien affecting the survivor.

So, the correct answer would be that the bank cannot execute on the mortgage because the woman's right of survivorship overrides the debt. That would be option C.

Wait, but another thought: in some cases, a mortgage by one tenant may be considered as a severance of the joint tenancy, especially if it's a lien theory state. But I think the majority view is that a mortgage by one joint tenant does not sever the tenancy because the mortgage is a lien, not a conveyance. So the joint tenancy remains, and upon death, the survivor gets the property, and the bank can only look to the deceased's interest, which is gone.

So the answer would be option C: No, the bank cannot execute because the woman's right of survivorship overrides the debt.

Alternatively, option J says no because in a lien theory state, the mortgage doesn't sever the joint tenancy. That might also be correct, but I'm not sure if that's the exact reason. The question is about whether the bank can execute, and the reason is the right of survivorship, so option C seems more precise.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused between C and J. Let me read the options again.

Option C: No, the bank cannot execute on the mortgage because the woman has the right of survivorship, which overrides the partner's debts.

Option J: No, the bank cannot execute on the mortgage because the majority view in a "lien theory" state is that a mortgage does not sever a joint tenancy.

So the reasoning in C is based on survivorship overriding the debt, while J is about the mortgage not severing the joint tenancy.

In a lien theory state, a mortgage doesn't sever the joint tenancy, so the joint tenancy remains. Upon the partner's death, the woman gets the property by survivorship, and the bank's lien was only on the partner's interest, which is extinguished. Therefore, the bank can't execute on the mortgage because the joint tenancy wasn't severed, and the woman's interest isn't encumbered.

So the correct answer would be J, because the mortgage doesn't sever the joint tenancy, so the bank can't execute.

Wait, but if the mortgage doesn't sever the joint tenancy, then the bank's lien would attach to the property as a whole? Or only to the partner's interest.

I think in joint tenancy, each tenant has an undivided interest. So the mortgage by one tenant would create a lien on their interest. But upon death, the survivor's interest is separate, so the lien would not affect it. Therefore, the bank can't execute because the lien was only on the partner's interest, which is gone.

So the answer is J because the mortgage doesn't sever the joint tenancy, so the bank can't execute.

Wait, but I'm getting conflicting thoughts here. Let me try to recall the majority rule. The majority view is that a mortgage by one joint tenant does not sever the joint tenancy. Therefore, the woman's right of survivorship would still apply, and the bank can't execute because the mortgage didn't sever the joint tenancy.

So the correct answer is J: No, the bank cannot execute because the majority view is that the mortgage doesn't sever the joint tenancy.

But wait, another angle: in some states, even if the joint tenancy isn't severed, the mortgagee can foreclose on the interest of the deceased. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, if the mortgage is a lien on the entire property, then upon the partner's death, the bank could foreclose on the entire property, because the lien was on the property, not just the partner's interest. But in joint tenancy, the right of survivorship might protect the other tenant.

I think the correct answer is J because in a lien theory state, the mortgage doesn't sever the joint tenancy, so the bank can't execute.

The question revolves around whether a bank can execute on a mortgage taken out by one partner in a joint tenancy with the right of survivorship, particularly in a "lien theory" state. A mortgage in such a state is considered a lien on the property rather than a transfer of title. The key issue is whether this lien affects the joint tenancy or the survivorship rights of the other partner.

The majority view is that a mortgage by one joint tenant does not sever the joint tenancy because the mortgage is a lien, not a conveyance of title. Therefore, the joint tenancy remains intact, and the right of survivorship ensures that the surviving partner takes the property free of the deceased partner's debts or liens. The bank's lien would only attach to the deceased partner's interest, which is extinguished upon their death, leaving the surviving partner's interest unaffected.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**J: No, the bank cannot execute on the mortgage because the majority view in a "lien theory" state is that a mortgage does not sever a joint tenancy.**
