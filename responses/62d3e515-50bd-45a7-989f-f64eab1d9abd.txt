Question:

Energy is harvested during cellular respiration in stages. Which of the following correctly states which phase of cellular respiration harvests the most energy and the correct explanation why?

Options:

A: The most energy is released during oxidative phosphorylation because H2O is completely broken down into H+ and O2.
B: The most energy is released during oxidative phosphorylation because in addition to the phosphorylation of ADP into ATP, all the potential energy held in NADH and FADH is transferred to ATP.
C: The most energy is released during the Krebs cycle because it is here that pyruvate is completely broken down into CO2.
D: The most energy is released during the Krebs cycle because it involves the release of energy from the oxidation of acetyl CoA.
E: The most energy is released during glycolysis because it is the first step in the breakdown of glucose to extract energy for cellular metabolism.
F: The most energy is released during the Krebs cycle because in addition to the production of ATP, both FADH2 and NADH are produced. Each of those molecules will release 2 ATPs and 3 ATPs, respectively.
G: The most energy is released during the Krebs cycle because it produces the most ATP molecules.
H: The most energy is released during the electron transport chain because it is the final stage of cellular respiration where the majority of ATP is produced.
I: The most energy is released during glycolysis because it produces ATP and NADH, which are used in the subsequent steps of respiration.
J: The most energy is released during oxidative phosphorylation because it involves the transfer of electrons from NADH or FADH2 to O2.

Okay, so I've got this question about cellular respiration and which phase releases the most energy. Let me try to think this through step by step. I remember that cellular respiration has a few main stages: glycolysis, the Krebs cycle (also called the citric acid cycle), and oxidative phosphorylation, which includes the electron transport chain and ATP synthesis.

First, glycolysis. I think it happens in the cytoplasm and doesn't require oxygen. From what I recall, glycolysis breaks down glucose into two pyruvate molecules. It produces a little ATP and some NADH. But wait, I think it's only about 2 ATP molecules and 2 NADH. So not a huge amount of energy, but it's the start.

Then there's the Krebs cycle, which takes place in the mitochondria. The pyruvate from glycolysis is converted into acetyl-CoA, which enters the Krebs cycle. Each turn of the cycle produces a few ATP, like 2 or 3, but more importantly, it generates a lot of NADH and FADH2. I remember that each NADH and FADH2 will later be used in the electron transport chain to produce more ATP. So while the Krebs cycle itself doesn't produce the most ATP directly, it's setting up a lot of high-energy molecules for later.

Then there's oxidative phosphorylation, which includes the electron transport chain and ATP synthase. This is where most of the ATP is made. The NADH and FADH2 from glycolysis and the Krebs cycle donate electrons, which drive the production of ATP. I think each NADH gives about 3 ATP and each FADH2 gives about 2 ATP. Since there's a lot more NADH produced, especially from the Krebs cycle, this phase probably contributes the most ATP overall.

Looking at the options:

Option A says oxidative phosphorylation because H2O is broken down. Wait, water isn't broken down in cellular respiration. That might be a red flag. I think H2O is a product, not a reactant here. So probably not A.

Option B: Oxidative phosphorylation because it uses NADH and FADH2 to make ATP. That makes sense because those high-energy molecules transfer their electrons, and that energy is used to make a lot of ATP. So B looks good.

Option C: Krebs cycle because pyruvate is broken into CO2. Well, the Krebs cycle does produce CO2, but I think it's not the most energy. The energy comes from the NADH and FADH2 rather than the CO2 release.

Option D: Krebs cycle because it involves oxidation of acetyl-CoA. But again, the energy comes from the electron carriers, not the cycle itself producing a lot of ATP directly. So less likely.

Option F: Krebs cycle because it produces FADH2 and NADH. But the Krebs cycle itself doesn't make the ATP; it's the electron transport chain that does. So F might be confusing because it's true that the Krebs makes those, but the energy is harvested later.

Option H: Electron transport chain (which is part of oxidative phosphorylation) is where most ATP is made. But the question is about oxidative phosphorylation as a phase, which includes both the electron transport and ATP synthase. So H could be correct in a way because it's part of that phase.

Wait, the question asks which phase harvests the most energy. So oxidative phosphorylation as a whole phase is responsible for the most ATP.

So looking at the options, B says that in oxidative phosphorylation, ADP is phosphorylated into ATP, and all the potential energy from NADH and FADH2 is transferred. That sounds right because those molecules are used to make a lot of ATP.

Option J says oxidative phosphorylation because electrons are transferred to O2. That's part of it, but it doesn't explain why it's the most energy. It's the transfer of electrons that drives ATP synthesis, but the explanation in B is more comprehensive.

So I think B is the correct answer. It correctly identifies oxidative phosphorylation as the phase where the most energy is harvested because it's utilizing all the high-energy carriers from previous steps.

The most energy is released during oxidative phosphorylation because in addition to the phosphorylation of ADP into ATP, all the potential energy held in NADH and FADH is transferred to ATP.

Answer: B
