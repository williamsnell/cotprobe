Question:

Congress enacts a statute that makes Pennsylvania Avenue a one-way street. Congress has enacted the statute solely for the purpose of enabling members of Congress to travel back and forth to the Capital without being tied up in heavy traffic each day. Before Congress enacted this law, the Washington, D. C. , City Council had previously passed an ordinance designating Pennsylvania Avenue as a two-lane street. Which of the following is the most accurate statement regarding the constitutionality of the federal statute designating Pennsylvania Avenue a one-way street?

Options:

A: It is invalid because it conflicts with the ordinance passed by the Washington, D.C., City Council.
B: It is valid as it is within the purview of Congress's power over transportation.
C: It is invalid because the law infringes upon the rights of the residents of Washington, D.C.
D: It is invalid because it is a discriminatory burden on interstate commerce.
E: It is valid because it is a proper exercise of Congress's enumerated property power.
F: It is invalid because it violates the Tenth Amendment.
G: It is valid because Congress has exclusive power over the District of Columbia.
H: It is valid because Congress has the power to regulate interstate commerce.
I: It is invalid because the Washington, D. C. , City Council has exclusive power over the public thoroughfares within the District of Columbia.
J: It is valid because it serves a clear governmental interest.

Alright, so I've got this multiple-choice question about constitutional law, specifically dealing with Congress's powers. Let's break it down step by step.

The question is about whether a federal statute making Pennsylvania Avenue a one-way street is constitutional. Congress passed this law to help members avoid traffic, while the D.C. City Council had previously made it a two-lane street.

First, I need to recall what powers Congress has over the District of Columbia. I remember that under the Constitution, Congress has exclusive authority over the District. Article I, Section 8 gives Congress the power to exercise exclusive Legislation in all Cases whatsoever, over the District. So, any local matters in D.C. are under Congress's control, not the city council.

Looking at the options, option G says it's valid because Congress has exclusive power over D.C. That seems right because the Constitution gives Congress that authority. But let me check the other options to make sure.

Option A says it's invalid because it conflicts with the D.C. ordinance. But if Congress has exclusive power, their law would override the city council's, so A is probably wrong.

Option I argues that the city council has exclusive power. But that's not the case since Congress's power is exclusive, so I is incorrect.

Options B and E talk about transportation and property powers. While Congress can regulate transportation under certain circumstances, like if it affects interstate commerce, here the main issue is about local streets in D.C., which falls under Congress's broader authority over the District. So B and E might not be the best answers.

Options C and F mention residents' rights and the Tenth Amendment. The Tenth Amendment deals with states' rights, but since D.C. isn't a state, and Congress's authority is exclusive, F doesn't apply. C is about infringement on residents, but the question is about whether Congress can override the local law, which they can, so C is probably wrong.

Option D talks about interstate commerce. The statute seems local, so it's not about commerce between states. D is likely incorrect.

Option H mentions interstate commerce regulation, but again, this doesn't seem to involve interstate commerce directly, so H might not apply.

Option J says it's valid because of a clear governmental interest. While that's true, the more specific reason is Congress's exclusive authority, so J is a contender but maybe not as precise as G.

So, putting it all together, the key point is that Congress has exclusive legislative power over D.C., making their statute valid regardless of the city council's prior ordinance. Therefore, the correct answer should be G.

The correct answer is G: It is valid because Congress has exclusive power over the District of Columbia. Congress's authority over the District is exclusive, as granted by Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution, allowing them to override local ordinances. 

Answer: G
