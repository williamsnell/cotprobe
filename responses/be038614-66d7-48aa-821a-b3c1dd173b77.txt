Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this biology question about the differences between animal and plant cells. The question asks what animal cells have that plant cells don't, and I have to choose from options A to D.

Let me start by recalling what I know about plant and animal cells. I remember that plant cells have certain structures that animal cells don't, and vice versa. For example, plant cells have cell walls made of cellulose, which are rigid and help maintain their shape. Animal cells don't have cell walls, so they might be more flexible or rounder because of that.

Looking at the options, option A says a cell wall made of cellulose. Wait, that's actually a feature of plant cells, not animal cells. So A is probably not the correct answer because the question is about what animal cells have that plant cells don't. So I can eliminate A.

Option B is lysosomes. I think lysosomes are present in both plant and animal cells. They're like the cell's recycling center, breaking down waste and old cellular components. So B might not be the right answer either because both have them.

Option C mentions large vacuoles that store water. Plant cells do have large central vacuoles that help them store water and maintain their turgor pressure, which is important for their structure. Animal cells don't typically have such large vacuoles. So C is probably a plant cell feature, making it the opposite of what the question is asking. So I can cross out C too.

That leaves option D: centrioles within centrosomes. Centrioles are organelles involved in cell division, especially in animal cells. I remember that in plant cells, during cell division, they use a different mechanism, like forming a cell plate, which doesn't require centrioles as much as animal cells do. Centrioles are found in the centrosome, which is a structure in the cytoplasm of animal cells. So D seems to be the correct answer because animal cells have centrioles, while plant cells don't typically have them in the same way.

The correct answer is D: centrioles within centrosomes, as animal cells have this structure while plant cells do not.

Answer: D
