Question:

It is observed that the chemical transmission occurring at a synapse is unidirectional that is, the neurotransmitter always travels from thepresynapticaxon to the post-synaptic dendrite . Explain why.

Options:

A: The neurotransmitter is present in the axonal end of a neuron only
B: Neurotransmitters can diffuse freely outside the synaptic cleft
C: Neurotransmitter travels in both directions
D: Neurotransmitter is present in the dendritic end only
E: The synaptic cleft prevents the movement of neurotransmitters
F: Neurotransmitter release is controlled by the post-synaptic neuron
G: Neurotransmitters are synthesized in the synaptic cleft
H: Neurotransmitter is not involved in this process

Okay, so I've got this question about why chemical transmission at a synapse is unidirectional. Hmm, I remember that synapses are the junctions between neurons where signals are passed. But why can't the signal go both ways?

Wait, the question says the neurotransmitter always goes from the presynaptic axon to the postsynaptic dendrite. So why is that? Let me think about how synapses work. I think the presynaptic neuron has a terminal button that releases neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft. The postsynaptic neuron has receptors that pick up these chemicals.

Oh right, the presynaptic part is where the action potential triggers the release of neurotransmitters. But the postsynaptic side doesn't have the machinery to release them back. So the neurotransmitters are only stored in the presynaptic neuron's vesicles. That makes sense. Like, the postsynaptic cell can't make the neurotransmitter because the necessary structures, like the vesicles and the enzymes to package them, aren't there on the dendrite side.

Looking at the options, option A says the neurotransmitter is present only in the axonal end. That seems right because the axon terminals have the vesicles with neurotransmitters. If the other end (dendrite) doesn't have them, they can't send signals back.

Option B says neurotransmitters can diffuse freely outside the cleft. Well, that's not the main reason for unidirectionality. They do diffuse, but that's just part of how they act on the receptors.

Option C is about traveling in both directions, which is the opposite of what's happening, so that's wrong.

Option D says it's only in the dendritic end, which is the opposite of the truth. The axon has the neurotransmitters.

Option E says the cleft prevents movement. But the cleft is just a gap; the neurotransmitters do cross it. So E is not correct.

Option F says the post-synaptic neuron controls release. No, the presynaptic neuron's action potential triggers the release. The post-synaptic doesn't control it.

Option G says neurotransmitters are made in the cleft. No, they're synthesized elsewhere in the neuron and transported to the axon terminals.

Option H is irrelevant, so it's out.

So the correct answer should be A: The neurotransmitter is present in the axonal end of a neuron only. That explains why they can only go one way.

The chemical transmission at a synapse is unidirectional because neurotransmitters are only present in the axonal end of the presynaptic neuron, where they are stored in vesicles and released upon stimulation. The postsynaptic dendrite lacks the necessary structures, such as vesicles and enzymes, to synthesize and release neurotransmitters, preventing the signal from traveling in the reverse direction.

Answer: A
