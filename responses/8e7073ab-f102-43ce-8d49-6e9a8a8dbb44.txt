Okay, so I've got this question about finding the gradient of a function with respect to w. Let me think through this step by step. I remember that when taking a gradient, I need to differentiate each term in the function separately and then add them up.

The function given is f(w) = (1/2)||Xw - y||²₂ + (1/2)λ||w||²₂. I know that the gradient of a sum is the sum of the gradients, so I'll handle each term one by one.

First, let's look at the first term: (1/2)||Xw - y||²₂. I recall that the squared norm can be expanded as (Xw - y)ᵀ(Xw - y). The derivative of this term with respect to w is known from linear algebra. I think it's Xᵀ(Xw - y). Let me double-check that. Oh wait, no, wait, when you take the derivative of (Xw - y)ᵀ(Xw - y), using the chain rule, the derivative is 2(Xw - y) multiplied by Xᵀ, but since there's a 1/2 factor, it cancels out the 2. So the gradient of the first term is Xᵀ(Xw - y).

Wait, no, I think I might have gotten that mixed up. Let me re-derive it. Let f1 = (1/2)(Xw - y)ᵀ(Xw - y). Expanding this gives (1/2)(wᵀXᵀXw - 2wᵀXᵀy + yᵀy). Taking the derivative with respect to w, the derivative of wᵀXᵀXw is XᵀXw because the derivative of a quadratic form aᵀBa is 2aB if B is symmetric, but wait, no, more precisely, the derivative of wᵀA w is (A + Aᵀ)w. Since XᵀX is symmetric, it's 2XᵀXw, but since f1 has a 1/2, it becomes (XᵀXw - Xᵀy).

Wait, no, let me think again. Let me write f1 as (1/2)(wᵀXᵀXw - 2wᵀXᵀy + yᵀy). The derivative of wᵀXᵀXw is XᵀXw because the derivative of wᵀA w is A w + (Aᵀ)w. Since XᵀX is symmetric (because (XᵀX)ᵀ = XᵀX), so the derivative is 2(XᵀX)w, but since f1 has a 1/2 factor, the derivative becomes (XᵀXw - Xᵀy). So that's correct.

Now the second term is (1/2)λ||w||²₂, which is (1/2)λ wᵀw. The derivative of this with respect to w is λ w. Because the derivative of wᵀw is 2w, so (1/2)λ * 2w = λ w.

Putting it all together, the gradient ∇f(w) is the sum of the two derivatives: Xᵀ(Xw - y) + λ w. Wait, wait, no, Xᵀ(Xw - y) is XᵀX w - Xᵀy. So the gradient is XᵀX w - Xᵀy + λ w.

Now looking at the options, let's see which one matches.

Option A: XᵀX w - Xᵀy + λ w → Yes, that's what I got.

Option D: XᵀX w - Xᵀy + λ → No, that's adding λ as a scalar, which doesn't make sense since w is a vector.

Option F: XᵀX w - Xᵀy - λ w → No, it's subtracting λ w instead of adding.

Option G: It looks more complicated with λ I, which isn't part of our terms.

So the correct answer should be option A.

The gradient is found by differentiating each term separately. The first term contributes XᵀXw - Xᵀy, and the second term adds λw. Combining these gives the correct option.
