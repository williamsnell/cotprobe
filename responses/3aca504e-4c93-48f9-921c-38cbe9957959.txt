Question:

A company that produces facial tissues continually monitors tissue strength. If the mean strength from sample data drops below a specified level, the production process is halted and the machinery inspected. Which of the following would result from a Type I error?

Options:

A: Allowing the production process to continue when the tissue strength is within specifications.
B: Halting the production process without any data on tissue strength.
C: Halting the production process when the machinery needs inspection.
D: Not halting the production process despite customer complaints.
E: Allowing the production process to continue when the tissue strength is below specifications.
F: Halting the production process when the tissue strength is below specifications.
G: Allowing the production process to continue when the tissue strength is above specifications.
H: Halting the production process when sufficient customer complaints are received.
I: Halting the production process when the tissue strength is within specifications.
J: Halting the production process when the tissue strength is above specifications.

Okay, so I have this question about statistics, specifically about Type I errors in the context of quality control for facial tissues. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the scenario: A company monitors the strength of their facial tissues. If the mean strength from a sample drops below a certain level, they stop production and inspect the machinery. So, the process involves hypothesis testing where they're checking if the strength is below the specified level.

Now, the question is about Type I error. I remember that in hypothesis testing, a Type I error occurs when you reject the null hypothesis when it's actually true. In other words, it's a false positive. So, the company would make a Type I error if they conclude that the mean strength is below the specified level (and thus stop production) when in reality it's notâ€”it's actually within specifications.

Let me look at the options:

Option A: Allowing production to continue when strength is within specs. That's actually a correct decision, not an error. So not this.

Option B: Halting production without data. Hmm, not sure. The question is about Type I error, which is based on data. So maybe not B.

Option C: Halting when machinery needs inspection. Wait, if the machinery needs inspection because strength is low, that's correct action, not an error.

Option D: Not halting despite complaints. That's more about not acting on feedback, not directly a Type I error.

Option E: Allowing production to continue when strength is below specs. That's a Type II error because they failed to reject the null when they should have. So not E.

Option F: Halting when strength is below specs. That's the correct action, so not an error.

Option G: Allowing production when strength is above specs. That's a correct decision, not an error.

Option H: Halting due to customer complaints. Again, that's a different trigger, not about statistical testing.

Option I: Halting when strength is within specs. Oh, wait! That's exactly what a Type I error is. They're stopping production (rejecting the null) when in reality the strength is okay (null is true). So I think this is the right answer.

Option J: Halting when strength is above specs. Again, that's not a statistical error; it's a correct action if they have a higher threshold, but I don't think that's the case here.

So, the Type I error is when they stop production even though the strength is fine. That's option I.

The Type I error occurs when the company halts production unnecessarily because they incorrectly conclude the tissue strength is below the specified level when it is actually within specifications.
