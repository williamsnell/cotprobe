Okay, so I've got this problem about calculating the change in molar Gibbs energy when the pressure of hydrogen gas increases isothermally from 1.0 atm to 100.0 atm at 298 K. Alright, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that Gibbs free energy change (ΔG) is related to the pressure change for an ideal gas. The formula I'm recalling is ΔG = nRT ln(P2/P1), but wait, since the question asks for molar Gibbs energy, I think n would be 1 mol. So the formula simplifies to ΔG_m = RT ln(P2/P1).

Wait, no, actually, for molar Gibbs energy, it's ΔG = RT ln(P2/P1). Because Gibbs energy change per mole would be when n=1. Right.

So, R is the gas constant. I need to make sure about the units. R is usually 8.314 J/(mol·K), but sometimes it's expressed in kJ. Let me check: 8.314 J/(mol·K) is correct. So, for this calculation, I'll use R = 8.314 J/(mol·K).

The temperature T is given as 298 K. The pressure goes from P1 = 1.0 atm to P2 = 100.0 atm. Since the process is isothermal, the temperature remains constant.

So plugging in the values: ΔG_m = (8.314 J/mol·K) * 298 K * ln(100/1).

Wait, ln(100) is what? Let me compute that. ln(100) is the natural logarithm of 100. I know ln(e) is 1, and e^4 is about 54.6, e^4.6 is around 100. So ln(100) ≈ 4.605.

So putting the numbers together: 8.314 * 298 ≈ Let's compute that. 8 * 298 is 2384, 0.314 * 298 ≈ 93.772. So total is approximately 2384 +93.772 = 2477.772 J/mol. Then multiply by 4.605.

Wait, wait, no, I think I made a mistake. 8.314 * 298: Let me calculate more accurately. 8 * 298 = 2384, 0.314 * 298 = let's compute 0.3 * 298 = 89.4, 0.014 *298=4.172. So 89.4 +4.172=93.572. So total R*T is 2384 +93.572 = 2477.572 J/mol.

Now multiply by ln(100)=4.605: 2477.572 *4.605. Let me approximate this. 2477.572 * 4 = 9910.288, 2477.572 *0.605 = ?

Hmm, 2477.572 * 0.6 = 1486.543, and 2477.572 *0.005=12.38786. So 1486.543 +12.38786 ≈ 1498.93086. So total is 9910.288 +1498.93086 ≈ 11409.218 J/mol. So approximately 11409 J/mol. Converting to kJ, that's 11.409 kJ/mol.

Wait, but the options are all in positive kJ. So the change is positive, which makes sense because when you increase pressure on a gas, if the gas is ideal, the Gibbs energy increases because the system becomes less favorable (since ideal gases favor lower pressures). So the change is positive, which matches the options being positive.

Looking at the options, the closest value is +11 kJ/mol, which is option I. But wait, let me double-check my calculations for any possible errors.

Wait, wait, wait. I think I might have messed up the computation of R*T. Let me calculate R*T again: 8.314 * 298.

8.314 * 300 would be 2494.2, but since it's 298, it's 2 less. So 8.314 *298 = 8.314*(300-2) = 2494.2 - (8.314*2) = 2494.2 -16.628 = 2477.572 J/mol, which matches my previous calculation.

Then, 2477.572 * ln(100) = 2477.572 *4.605.

Let me compute 2477.572 *4 = 9910.288, 2477.572 *0.6=1486.5432, and 2477.572 *0.005=12.38786. So adding 4.605: 4 +0.6 +0.005.

Wait, 4.605 is 4 + 0.6 + 0.005? No, 4.605 is 4 + 0.6 + 0.005? Wait, 0.6 is 0.6, and 0.005 is 0.005. So yes. So the sum is 9910.288 +1486.5432 = 11396.8312 +12.38786 = 11409.219 J/mol, which is 11.409 kJ/mol.

Hmm, the options don't have 11.4, but option I is +11 kJ/mol. So that's probably the correct answer.

Wait, but looking at the options again: option I is +11, and option H is +5, etc. So 11.4 is closest to 11. So I think the correct answer is I: +11 kJ/mol.

To calculate the change in molar Gibbs energy (ΔG_m) for hydrogen gas when its pressure increases isothermally from 1.0 atm to 100.0 atm at 298 K, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta G_m = RT \ln\left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)
\]

where:
- \( R = 8.314 \, \mathrm{J/(mol \cdot K)} \) (gas constant),
- \( T = 298 \, \mathrm{K} \) (temperature),
- \( P_1 = 1.0 \, \mathrm{atm} \),
- \( P_2 = 100.0 \, \mathrm{atm} \).

First, calculate \( \ln(P_2/P_1) = \ln(100/1) = \ln(100) \approx 4.605 \).

Next, compute \( RT = (8.314 \, \mathrm{J/(mol \cdot K)}) \times (298 \, \mathrm{K}) \approx 2477.572 \, \mathrm{J/mol} \).

Now, calculate \( \Delta G_m \):
\[
\Delta G_m = 2477.572 \, \mathrm{J/mol} \times 4.605 \approx 11409.219 \, \mathrm{J/mol} = 11.409 \, \mathrm{kJ/mol}.
\]

The change in molar Gibbs energy is approximately \( +11.4 \, \mathrm{kJ/mol} \). Among the given options, the closest value is \( +11 \, \mathrm{kJ/mol} \), which corresponds to option I.
