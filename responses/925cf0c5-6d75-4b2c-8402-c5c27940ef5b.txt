Question:

A professor was the record owner in fee simple absolute of a 30-acre tract of land located in a small town. The professor made a conveyance thereof in these words, "I hereby convey my 30-acre tract to both my friend and my co-worker as joint tenants with right of survivorship. "Two years after making the conveyance to the friend and the co-worker, the friend executed a mortgage on the 30-acre tract of land to a bank to secure a loan. One year after executing the mortgage, the friend died intestate, leaving his uncle as his only heir. At the time of the friend's death, the indebtedness had not been paid to the bank. The jurisdiction in which the 30-acre tract of land is located recognizes a title theory of mortgages. In an appropriate action, the court should determine that title to the 30-acre tract of land is vested

Options:

A: in the bank until the mortgage is paid, then in the co-worker and the uncle.
B: half in the co-worker and half in the bank, with both subject to the mortgage.
C: entirely in the uncle, subject to the mortgage.
D: entirely in the uncle, free and clear of the mortgage.
E: half in the co-worker and half in the uncle, with both subject to the mortgage.
F: in the co-worker and the uncle, with the co-worker's portion free of the mortgage and the uncle's portion subject to it.
G: half in the co-worker, free of the mortgage, and half in the uncle, subject to the mortgage.
H: in the co-worker, with the entire interest subject to the mortgage.
I: half in the co-worker, subject to the mortgage, and half in the uncle, free of the mortgage.

Okay, so I have this property law question here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand all the details.

So, a professor owns a 30-acre tract in fee simple absolute. He conveys it to his friend and co-worker as joint tenants with the right of survivorship. Two years later, the friend takes out a mortgage from a bank to secure a loan. Then, the friend dies intestate, leaving his uncle as the only heir. The mortgage hasn't been paid yet when he dies. The jurisdiction follows the title theory of mortgages. The question is about who owns the land now and how the mortgage affects it.

First, I need to break down the conveyance. The professor conveyed the land to both the friend and co-worker as joint tenants. That means they hold the property together, each with an undivided half-interest. But because it's joint tenancy, if one dies, the survivor gets the deceased's share. So, when the friend dies, the co-worker would take his share through the right of survivorship.

Next, the friend executed a mortgage. In title theory jurisdictions, a mortgage is considered a conveyance of legal title as security for the loan. So, when the friend took out the mortgage, he (as a joint tenant) would have conveyed his interest in the property to the bank as security. But since it's joint tenancy, does that mean both the friend and the co-worker's interests are affected? Or does the mortgage only affect the friend's share?

Wait, in joint tenancy, each tenant has an undivided interest. So, when the friend mortgages his interest, does that mortgage attach to the entire property or just his half? In title theory, the mortgage conveys legal title. But in joint tenancy, the legal title is held jointly. So, can one joint tenant mortgage the entire property without the consent of the other? I think in some states, one joint tenant can mortgage their interest, but others require consent. But in title theory states, the mortgage is a conveyance, so the friend would have conveyed his interest to the bank.

But wait, when the friend dies, what happens to the mortgage? The co-worker, as the survivor, would take the friend's share. But the mortgage was taken by the friend. Does that mortgage survive the friend's death and affect the co-worker's interest?

I'm a bit confused here. Let me think again. When the friend took out the mortgage, he was a joint tenant. So, under title theory, he conveyed his legal title to the bank. But in joint tenancy, the title is held jointly, so perhaps the mortgage only affects the friend's interest. But does that mean the bank holds the mortgage on the friend's share?

But when the friend dies, the co-worker takes the friend's share by survivorship. So, does the mortgage survive and attach to the co-worker's interest? Or does the mortgage only affect the friend's share, which is now extinguished upon his death, leaving the co-worker's interest unaffected?

Wait, in title theory, the mortgage is a conveyance of legal title. So, if the friend conveyed his half-interest to the bank, then the bank would have a lien on that half. However, when the friend dies, his half goes to the co-worker via survivorship. So, the co-worker now owns the entire property, but the bank's mortgage was only on the friend's half. But since the friend's half was extinguished and transferred to the co-worker, does the mortgage now encumber the co-worker's interest?

Alternatively, perhaps the mortgage only affected the friend's interest, and upon his death, the co-worker takes the entire property free of the mortgage because the friend's interest was extinguished.

Wait, no. Because in title theory, the mortgage is a lien on the property. If the friend conveyed his interest to the bank, then when he dies, the co-worker takes the entire property, but the bank's mortgage would have attached to the friend's interest. But since the friend's interest is extinguished, does that mean the mortgage is extinguished as well? Or does the mortgage now attach to the co-worker's interest because the property is still the same.

I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me try to outline the steps:

1. Conveyance: Friend and Co-worker as joint tenants. Each has undivided 50% interest.

2. Friend mortgages his interest to the bank. In title theory, this conveys legal title of his 50% to the bank as security.

3. Friend dies intestate. His only heir is the uncle.

4. Upon friend's death, his 50% interest goes to co-worker via survivorship. So co-worker now owns 100%.

Wait, but the friend's 50% is subject to the mortgage. So when the friend dies, the co-worker takes the 50% that was mortgaged. So does the mortgage now affect the co-worker's interest?

Alternatively, perhaps the mortgage was only on the friend's interest, and since that interest is extinguished, the mortgage is extinguished too. But that doesn't make sense because the mortgage is a lien on the property. If the friend's interest was mortgaged, then the co-worker's taking of that interest would mean the mortgage now affects the co-worker's share.

Wait, but in joint tenancy, the right of survivorship applies to the entire interest. So when the friend dies, the co-worker takes the entire property, including any encumbrances on the friend's share. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the mortgage is on the friend's interest, which is 50%. So when the friend dies, the co-worker takes the entire property, but the bank has a mortgage on 50% of it. So the co-worker owns the entire property subject to the mortgage on half.

But wait, in title theory, the mortgage is a conveyance of title. So when the friend conveyed his interest to the bank, the bank holds legal title to his 50%. Upon friend's death, the co-worker's survivorship would take the friend's interest, but if the friend's interest was already conveyed to the bank, then the co-worker takes it from the bank? That doesn't make sense because the right of survivorship operates at the time of death, and the mortgage was already in place.

Alternatively, perhaps the mortgage is considered to have been on the friend's interest, and upon his death, the co-worker takes the property free of that mortgage because the mortgage was only on the friend's share, which is extinguished.

Wait, no. Because the mortgage is a lien on the property. If the friend's interest was mortgaged, then the lien would attach to the property. When the friend dies, the co-worker takes the entire property, but the lien (mortgage) would still be on the property. So the co-worker's ownership would be subject to the mortgage.

But wait, the co-worker didn't take the mortgage himself; it was the friend who took it. So in title theory, the mortgage was a conveyance of the friend's interest to the bank. So upon the friend's death, the co-worker's survivorship would mean that the co-worker takes the friend's interest, but that interest was already mortgaged. So the co-worker would take the entire property, but the bank has a mortgage on the 50% that was the friend's. So the co-worker now owns 100%, but the bank has a lien on 50% of it.

Wait, but in joint tenancy, when one tenant mortgages their interest, does that affect the other? In some states, a joint tenant can mortgage their interest without the consent of the other, but it only affects their own interest. So the mortgage would be on the friend's 50%, and when he dies, the co-worker takes that 50% subject to the mortgage.

So the co-worker now owns the entire property, but 50% of it is subject to the mortgage. So the co-worker's ownership is subject to the mortgage on half the property.

Wait, but the question is about the ownership upon the friend's death. The options are about who owns the property and under what conditions.

Looking at the options:

Option E: half in co-worker and half in uncle, both subject to mortgage. That doesn't seem right because the friend died intestate, so his interest would go to the co-worker via survivorship, not to his uncle.

Wait, the friend died intestate, but he was a joint tenant. So the right of survivorship applies between the friend and the co-worker. So when the friend dies, his interest goes to the co-worker, not to his uncle. The uncle would only inherit if the friend had owned property in his own name, but in joint tenancy, his interest doesn't go to his heirs because the survivor takes it.

So the co-worker now owns the entire 30-acre tract, but the friend's 50% was mortgaged. So the co-worker's ownership is subject to the mortgage on the 50% that was the friend's.

Wait, but the mortgage was taken by the friend. So, when the friend dies, does the mortgage survive and encumber the co-worker's interest? Or does the co-worker take it free of the mortgage?

I think in title theory, when the friend mortgages his interest, the bank has a lien on that 50%. Upon the friend's death, the co-worker takes the 50% through survivorship, but the mortgage lien remains on that portion. So the co-worker now owns the entire property, but half of it is subject to the mortgage.

Wait, but the co-worker didn't take the mortgage; the friend did. So the co-worker would take the entire property, but the bank's mortgage would only affect the friend's half. So the co-worker's ownership is subject to the mortgage on half the property.

But looking at the options, I don't see an option where the co-worker owns the entire property with half subject to the mortgage. Let me check the options again.

Option E: half in co-worker and half in uncle, both subject to mortgage. No, because the co-worker owns it all, not half.

Option H: entirely in the co-worker, with the entire interest subject to the mortgage. That would mean the mortgage is on the whole property, but the friend only mortgaged his half.

Option G: half in co-worker free, half in uncle subject. No, because the co-worker takes the entire property.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently.

When the friend took out the mortgage, he conveyed his interest to the bank. So the bank has a mortgage on the friend's 50%. When the friend dies, the co-worker takes the 50% via survivorship. So the co-worker's 50% is now free of the mortgage because the friend's interest was extinguished, and the mortgage was on that interest.

Wait, no. Because in title theory, the mortgage is a lien on the property. If the friend conveyed his 50% to the bank, then when the friend dies, the co-worker takes the 50% from the bank? That doesn't make sense. Or perhaps the mortgage only affects the friend's share, and upon his death, the co-worker takes the 50% free of the mortgage because the friend's interest was extinguished.

But I'm not sure. Another approach: in title theory, the mortgage is a conveyance of title to the mortgagee (bank) as security. So the friend's 50% is now owned by the bank, but the co-worker still owns his 50%. When the friend dies, the co-worker's 50% remains, and the friend's 50% is now owned by the bank. So the co-worker doesn't take the friend's 50% because it's now with the bank. Wait, that can't be right because in joint tenancy, the survivor takes the entire property.

Hmm, this is getting confusing. Maybe I should look up how joint tenancy interacts with mortgages in title theory states.

Wait, from what I remember, in a joint tenancy, each tenant has an undivided interest. If one tenant mortgages their interest, in title theory states, that mortgage would convey their interest to the mortgagee. So the mortgagee would have a lien on the mortgaging tenant's interest. But when that tenant dies, the right of survivorship would pass their interest to the other tenant. So the mortgagee's lien would attach to the deceased tenant's interest, which is now passing to the survivor.

Therefore, the survivor would take the entire property, but the mortgage would attach to the portion that was the deceased's. So the survivor's ownership is subject to the mortgage on the deceased's half.

Wait, but how does that work? The co-worker would own the entire property, but the bank has a mortgage on 50% of it. So the co-worker owns 50% free and clear (their original interest) and 50% subject to the mortgage (the friend's interest). So the entire property is subject to the mortgage on half.

But looking at the options, I don't see this exact scenario. Let me check the options again.

Option E: half in co-worker and half in uncle, both subject to mortgage. No, because the co-worker takes the entire property.

Option F: co-worker and uncle, co-worker's portion free, uncle's subject. No, because the uncle doesn't get any share.

Option G: half in co-worker free, half in uncle subject. No, uncle doesn't get anything.

Option H: entirely in co-worker, entire interest subject to mortgage. That would mean the entire property is mortgaged, but only the friend's half was.

Option I: half in co-worker, subject, and half in uncle, free. No, uncle doesn't get anything.

Wait, maybe I'm wrong. Perhaps the mortgage only affects the friend's interest, and upon his death, the co-worker takes the entire property, but the mortgage is extinguished because the friend's interest is gone. So the co-worker owns the entire property free of the mortgage.

But that doesn't seem right because the mortgage was on the property, not just the friend's interest. If the friend had a mortgage, and then dies, the co-worker takes the property, but the mortgage would still be on the property. But since the co-worker didn't take the mortgage, does it affect him?

Wait, perhaps in title theory, the mortgage is a lien on the specific interest conveyed. So the friend conveyed his 50% to the bank. When the friend dies, the co-worker takes the 50% via survivorship, but that 50% was already mortgaged. So the co-worker's 50% is subject to the mortgage, and the co-worker's other 50% is free. Wait, no, because in joint tenancy, both have undivided interests. So the co-worker's 50% was never mortgaged, but the friend's 50% was. So after the friend's death, the co-worker owns the entire property, but half of it is subject to the mortgage.

But the options don't have that. Let me look again.

Option E: half co-worker and half uncle, both subject. No, uncle doesn't get anything.

Option F: co-worker and uncle, co-worker's free, uncle's subject. No.

Option G: half co-worker free, half uncle subject. No.

Option H: entirely co-worker, entire subject.

Wait, perhaps the mortgage is extinguished upon the friend's death because the interest was transferred via survivorship. So the co-worker takes the entire property free of the mortgage. But that doesn't seem right because the mortgage would still be on the property.

Alternatively, maybe the mortgage is a lien on the property, so when the friend dies, the co-worker takes the property subject to the lien. So the co-worker now owns the property, but it's subject to the mortgage that the friend had.

So the co-worker owns the entire property, but it's subject to the mortgage. So the correct answer would be that the co-worker owns the entire property, subject to the mortgage.

Looking at the options, option H says: entirely in the co-worker, with the entire interest subject to the mortgage.

But wait, the mortgage was only on the friend's 50%, not the entire property. So is the entire property subject or just half?

I'm getting stuck here. Maybe the answer is that the co-worker owns the entire property, but the mortgage only affects the friend's half. However, the options don't reflect that. So perhaps the correct answer is that the co-worker owns the entire property, and the mortgage is on the entire property because the friend's interest was part of it.

Wait, but in title theory, the mortgage is on the specific interest. So the bank has a mortgage on the friend's 50%, not the entire property. Therefore, the co-worker's ownership is subject to the mortgage on 50%, but the other 50% is free. However, the options don't exactly match this.

Alternatively, perhaps the mortgage is on the entire property because the friend was a joint tenant and the mortgage would cover his interest, which is 50%. So the co-worker owns the entire property, but the mortgage is on 50% of it.

But looking at the options, none of them say that. So perhaps the correct answer is that the co-worker owns the entire property subject to the mortgage because the mortgage attached to the property, not just the friend's interest.

In that case, option H would be correct: entirely in the co-worker, entire interest subject to the mortgage.

But I'm not entirely sure. Another angle: the friend's death causes the co-worker to take the entire property. The mortgage was on the friend's interest. So the co-worker's ownership is subject to the mortgage on the 50% that was the friend's.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the answer is E: half in co-worker and half in uncle, both subject. But the uncle doesn't get any share because of the joint tenancy.

Wait, no. The friend's interest goes to the co-worker, so the uncle doesn't inherit anything from the friend regarding the property. So the uncle isn't a part of the ownership.

So the only options left are those where the co-worker owns the entire property, either subject to the mortgage or free.

If the mortgage is on the friend's 50%, then the co-worker owns the entire property, but 50% is subject to the mortgage. But the options don't have that. The closest is option E, but that's incorrect because the uncle doesn't get anything.

Wait, perhaps I'm thinking wrong. When the friend dies, the co-worker takes the entire property, but the friend's interest was mortgaged. So the mortgage is still valid against the property. Therefore, the co-worker owns the entire property, but it's subject to the mortgage. So the answer is H: entirely in the co-worker, entire interest subject.

But I'm not 100% confident. Alternatively, maybe the mortgage only affected the friend's interest, and upon his death, the co-worker's ownership is free because the friend's interest was extinguished. But that doesn't make sense because the mortgage is a lien on the property.

I think I'll go with option H: entirely in the co-worker, entire interest subject to the mortgage.
</think>

The professor conveyed the 30-acre tract to the friend and co-worker as joint tenants with the right of survivorship. Under joint tenancy, each holds an undivided interest, and the survivor takes the deceased tenant's share. The friend later mortgaged his interest to the bank, and in a title theory jurisdiction, this conveys legal title of his 50% interest to the bank as security. When the friend died intestate, the co-worker, as the surviving joint tenant, took the entire property by survivorship. However, the mortgage, being a lien on the property, would encumber the friend's 50% interest, which now passes to the co-worker. Thus, the co-worker owns the entire property, but the mortgage attaches to the 50% that was the friend's interest. Among the options, the most accurate is that the co-worker owns the entire property, with the entire interest subject to the mortgage.

Answer: H
