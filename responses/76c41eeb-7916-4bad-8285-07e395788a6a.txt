Question:

The Russell-Saunders coupling of the angularmomenta of two atomicorbitalsgives rise to a quantum number L in which all the angular quantum numbers,l_i, are combined vectorially. That is, L = l_1 + l_2 , l_1 + l2- 1, ... , \vertl1- l_2\vert What will be the values of L when a p and a d electron in-teract?

Okay, so I've got this question about the Russell-Saunders coupling, also known as LS coupling. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about finding the possible values of L when a p electron and a d electron interact. 

First, I remember that LS coupling involves combining the angular momenta of two electrons. Each electron has its own orbital angular momentum quantum number, l. So, for a p electron, l₁ is 1 because p orbitals have l=1. For a d electron, l₂ is 2 since d orbitals have l=2.

The next step is to find all possible values of L, which is the sum of the two angular momenta when combined vectorially. The formula for L gives possible values from |l₁ - l₂| up to l₁ + l₂, in integer steps. 

So, let's compute that. l₁ is 1, l₂ is 2. The maximum possible L is 1 + 2 = 3. The minimum is |1 - 2| = 1. So the possible L values should be 3, 2, 1. 

Wait, but looking at the options, let me check each one. Option A is 3,2,0. That can't be right because the minimum is 1, not 0. Option C is 2,1,0—no, same issue. Option D is 2,1,1—wait, that's two 1s, which doesn't make sense since L should go down by 1 each time. Option H is 3,1,0. That skips 2, so that's not it. Option E is 5,3,1—way too high, since 1+2=3 max. 

Wait, what about the options? Let me look again. The possible L values are 3, 2, 1. So looking for an option with those three numbers in any order. Let me check the options:

Option G: 3,2,1. That's exactly what I thought. So the correct answer should be G. Let me double-check. If l1=1 and l2=2, then L can be 3 (1+2), 2 (1+1), 1 (2-1). So yes, the values are 3,2,1. So the answer is G.

The possible values of L when a p (l₁=1) and a d (l₂=2) electron interact are determined by combining their angular momenta. The formula for L gives values from |l₁ - l₂| to l₁ + l₂ in integer steps. Substituting l₁=1 and l₂=2, the possible L values are 3, 2, and 1. The correct option is G, which lists these values.

Answer: G
