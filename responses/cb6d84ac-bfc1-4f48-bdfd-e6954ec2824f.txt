Question:

 Which of the following potentially morally relevant differences between Fred's behavior and the behavior of the consumers of factory-raised meat does Norcross not discuss?

Options:

A: Fred's behavior involves the suffering of puppies, whereas the behavior of meat-eaters "merely" involves the suffering of chickens, pigs, cows, calves, sheep, and the like.
B: The suffering of the puppies is necessary for gustatory pleasure, whereas the suffering of animals on factory farms is simply a by-product of the conditions dictated by economic considerations.
C: Fred could prevent the suffering of the puppies, whereas meat-eaters can't prevent the suffering of the animals they consume.
D: none of the above

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this multiple-choice question about Norcross's discussion on the morally relevant differences between Fred's behavior and meat-eaters. Let's break it down step by step.

First, I need to understand the question. It's asking which potential morally relevant difference Norcross does NOT discuss between Fred's actions and the meat-eaters. The options are A, B, C, and D (which is none of the above). 

I remember that Norcross wrote about factory farming and the moral issues surrounding it. Fred's behavior is probably something else, maybe related to causing puppy suffering, while the meat-eaters are involved in factory-raised meat consumption.

Looking at the options:

A: Fred's behavior involves puppies' suffering, whereas meat-eaters involve chickens, pigs, etc. So Norcross might compare which animals are involved, but the question is about whether he discusses this as a morally relevant difference.

B: Suggests that Fred's suffering is for gustatory pleasure, while meat farms have suffering as a by-product. Wait, but in factory farming, the suffering is a result of the farming practices, which is more about efficiency and cost, not directly for taste. So Norcross might discuss whether the suffering is a means to an end or a by-product.

C: Fred can prevent puppies' suffering, but meat-eaters can't prevent animals' suffering. That's about the ability to change the outcome. Norcross might talk about agency or control over the situation.

D: None of the above, meaning all differences are discussed, so the answer would be that Norcross doesn't discuss one of these.

Now, I need to recall what Norcross actually says. From what I remember, Norcross compares the moral responsibility of those who eat meat with others who cause unnecessary suffering. He might argue against the idea that eating meat is worse because the suffering is a by-product, not intended for pleasure. So, he might say that both are morally bad, but the meat-eaters aren't directly causing suffering for pleasure, just as a side effect.

In his arguments, he might not focus on whether Fred can prevent the suffering versus meat-eaters. Or maybe he does. Alternatively, he might not discuss the types of animals involved as a morally relevant difference because the moral issue is more about the suffering itself, regardless of the species.

Wait, in Norcross's essay, he probably doesn't make a distinction based on the type of animal (puppies vs. other farm animals) as a morally relevant factor. Instead, he might argue that the intent and the consequences are what matter. So he might not discuss option A as a relevant difference.

Alternatively, looking at option B: Fred's suffering is for gustatory pleasure, while in factory farms, it's a by-product. Norcross might point out that in both cases, the suffering is a means to an endâ€”whether for taste (Fred) or for food production (meat-eaters). So he might not see a significant moral difference here, meaning he doesn't discuss this as a difference.

Option C: Fred can prevent the suffering, but meat-eaters can't. I think Norcross would argue that both can choose alternatives. Fred can stop causing puppy suffering, and meat-eaters can choose plant-based diets. So he might discuss this as a point about agency, meaning he does address it. Therefore, option C is something he discusses.

So, if Norcross doesn't discuss the necessity or the nature of the suffering (whether for pleasure or by-product), then option B is the difference he doesn't discuss. Alternatively, if he doesn't make a distinction between the animals involved, then option A isn't discussed.

Wait, another angle: Fred is causing suffering directly, like in puppy mills, where the puppies' suffering is intentional for profit, whereas factory farming's suffering is a by-product of efficient production. Norcross might argue that the intent matters, but I'm not sure if he discusses that. Alternatively, he might not see a moral difference between causing suffering directly or as a by-product because both are harmful.

So, the question is which difference Norcross does NOT discuss. If he doesn't talk about the necessity of the suffering for gustatory pleasure versus being a by-product, then option B is the answer. Or if he doesn't discuss the types of animals (option A), then A would be the answer.

I think Norcross focuses more on the fact that both actions cause unnecessary suffering, regardless of the intent behind it. So he might not make a distinction between Fred's suffering for pleasure and meat-eaters' suffering as a by-product. Therefore, he doesn't discuss option B as a morally relevant difference.

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe he does discuss that Fred's suffering is for pleasure, making it worse, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach: looking for what's not discussed. If Norcross doesn't bring up the idea that Fred can prevent it but meat-eaters can't, then option C would be the answer. But I think he does address the ability to change one's behavior, so option C is discussed.

Therefore, the difference Norcross doesn't discuss is option B, because he might argue that both cases involve suffering as a means to an end, so the fact that one is for pleasure and the other a by-product isn't morally significant. Or perhaps he doesn't address that point at all.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The question is about which difference is NOT discussed. If Norcross doesn't talk about whether the suffering is necessary for gustatory pleasure or a by-product, then option B is the answer. Alternatively, if he doesn't discuss the types of animals (option A), then A is the answer.

I think Norcross would consider the intent and the consequences, but perhaps not the specific point in option B. Or maybe he does. I'm a bit stuck here.

Wait, another angle: Fred's behavior is causing suffering for profit (like puppy mills), while meat-eaters' suffering is a by-product of producing meat. So the economic aspect is different. But Norcross might argue that both are economic in nature, so the difference in option B isn't morally relevant, hence he doesn't discuss it.

So, putting it all together, I think the answer is D: none of the above. Because Norcross might discuss all of these points, or perhaps the differences he doesn't discuss are not listed, but given the options, I'm not sure.

Wait, I'm getting more confused. Maybe I should look for the correct answer based on Norcross's arguments. From what I recall, Norcross argues against the idea that factory farming is worse because the suffering is a by-product, not intended. He says that intent doesn't make it morally better or worse. So he might not discuss option B as a difference because he thinks both are equally bad, regardless of intent.

Therefore, the difference in option B is something Norcross doesn't discuss as a morally relevant point. So the answer would be B, but looking back, the options are A, B, C, D.

Wait, the question is which difference is NOT discussed. So if Norcross doesn't talk about B, then the answer is B. But if he does discuss all of them, the answer is D.

Hmm. I think Norcross does discuss the points in A and C, but not B. So the answer is B. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, I might be wrong.

Wait, another way: Fred's behavior is about puppy mills, and the meat-eaters are about factory farms. Norcross might not discuss the specific animals, so A is a difference he doesn't discuss. But I think he focuses on the suffering, not the species.

So, perhaps Norcross doesn't discuss A as a morally relevant difference because the type of animal doesn't matter morally. So the answer would be A.

I'm getting stuck between A and B. I think the correct answer is D: none of the above, meaning Norcross discusses all the differences, so none is left out. But I'm not certain.

Wait, the correct answer is D. Because Norcross does discuss these points. Wait, no, the question is which difference he does NOT discuss. So if all the options are discussed by Norcross, the answer is D. But I'm not sure if he discusses all of them.

Alternatively, perhaps Norcross doesn't discuss C. Let me think: Fred could prevent the suffering, but meat-eaters can't. That doesn't make sense because meat-eaters can choose to not eat meat, thus preventing the suffering. So C is incorrect because both can prevent it. So Norcross might discuss that, so C is something he does talk about.

Therefore, the difference he doesn't discuss is B. So the answer is B.

Wait, but I'm still uncertain. Maybe the answer is D. I think I'll go with D: none of the above, meaning all the differences are discussed, so the answer is D. But I'm not sure.
</think>

The question asks which morally relevant difference Norcross does not discuss between Fred's behavior and meat-eaters. After analyzing the options, it appears that Norcross focuses on the suffering caused and the ability to change behavior, but does not specifically address whether the suffering is for gustatory pleasure or a by-product. Therefore, the answer is:

D
