Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the percentage of sulfur in a tomato. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand it.

The problem says that a tomato weighing 60.0 grams is analyzed for sulfur content. The method used is digestion in concentrated HNO3, which I think is nitric acid. Then, the sulfur is precipitated with Ba to form BaSO4. They obtained 0.466 grams of BaSO4. The question is, what's the percentage of sulfur in the tomato if all the sulfur was converted to BaSO4?

Hmm, right. So the steps involved here are probably stoichiometry. I remember that when you have a precipitate like BaSO4, you can find out how much of the original substance was present by using molar masses and the chemical reactions.

First, I think I should find out how much sulfur is in the BaSO4 that was formed. Because if all the sulfur in the tomato ended up as BaSO4, then the amount of S in BaSO4 is the same as the amount in the tomato.

So, let's write down the formula for barium sulfate: BaSO4. The molar mass of BaSO4 is the sum of the molar masses of each element in it. Barium (Ba) has a molar mass of about 137.33 g/mol, sulfur (S) is 32.07 g/mol, and oxygen (O) is 16.00 g/mol times 4, because there are four oxygen atoms.

Calculating that: 137.33 + 32.07 + (16.00 * 4) = 137.33 + 32.07 = 169.4, plus 64 (since 16*4=64) equals 233.4 g/mol for BaSO4.

Wait, no, let me double-check that calculation. Oh wait, 137.33 + 32.07 is 169.4, and 16*4 is 64, so 169.4 +64 is 233.4 g/mol. That seems right.

Now, the mass of BaSO4 obtained is 0.466 grams. To find the moles of BaSO4, I can divide the mass by the molar mass.

So moles of BaSO4 = 0.466 g / 233.4 g/mol. Let me calculate that.

0.466 divided by 233.4. Let me see, 233.4 goes into 0.466 about 0.002 moles. Wait, let me do it more accurately.

233.4 is roughly 233.4, so 0.466 / 233.4 ≈ 0.002 moles. Wait, let me compute that precisely.

233.4 times 0.002 is 0.4668, which is close to 0.466, so it's approximately 0.002 moles of BaSO4.

Now, since each mole of BaSO4 contains one mole of S, the moles of S are the same as moles of BaSO4. So moles of S = 0.002 moles.

Next, I need to find the mass of sulfur in the tomato. The molar mass of sulfur is 32.07 g/mol. So mass of S = moles * molar mass.

That's 0.002 mol * 32.07 g/mol = 0.06414 grams of sulfur.

Wait, let me check that calculation: 0.002 *32.07 is 0.06414 grams. So approximately 0.06414 grams of sulfur in the tomato.

Now, the tomato's total mass is 60.0 grams. To find the percentage of sulfur, I can do (mass of S / mass of tomato) * 100%.

So that's (0.06414 g / 60.0 g) * 100.

Let me compute that. 0.06414 divided by 60 equals approximately 0.001069. Multiply by 100 gives 0.1069%, which is about 0.107%.

Looking at the options, option C is 0.11%, which matches this. Hmm, but wait, perhaps I should double-check my calculations for any errors.

Wait, let me go through each step again.

Molar mass of BaSO4: Ba is 137.33, S is 32.07, O is 16.00 each, so 4*16=64. So total is 137.33 +32.07=169.4, plus 64 is 233.4 g/mol. That's correct.

Moles of BaSO4: 0.466 g / 233.4 g/mol. Let me compute that more accurately. 

233.4 goes into 0.466 how many times? Let's compute 0.466 ÷ 233.4.

Well, 233.4 * 0.002 = 0.4668, which is a bit more than 0.466. So 0.002 mol would give 0.4668g, but we have 0.466g, which is 0.002 * (0.466/0.4668) ≈ 0.001995 mol. So approximately 0.002 mol, but a bit less. Let's compute it precisely.

Using a calculator: 0.466 / 233.4 ≈ 0.002000... Wait, actually, 233.4 * 0.002 is 0.4668, which is 0.0008 grams more than 0.466. So perhaps it's better to compute it as 0.466 ÷ 233.4 = approximately 0.002000 mol? Wait, no, because 233.4 * 0.002 is 0.4668, which is 0.0008g more than 0.466g. So perhaps the moles are 0.002 mol * (0.466 / 0.4668) ≈ 0.001995 mol. So approximately 0.001995 mol of BaSO4.

So the moles of S would be the same, 0.001995 mol.

Now, mass of S is moles * molar mass: 0.001995 mol *32.07 g/mol.

0.001995 *32.07 = let's compute that.

32.07 * 0.001995 ≈ 0.064 g (since 32 *0.002=0.064, and the 0.07*0.002=0.00014, so total around 0.06414 grams).

So mass of S is approximately 0.06414 grams.

Then, percentage in tomato: (0.06414 g / 60.0g) *100 = ?

0.06414 /60 = 0.001069, times 100 is 0.1069%.

Looking at the options, option C is 0.11%, which would be the correct answer.

Wait, but let me check the options again:

Options are:

A: 0.065%

B: 0.18%

C: 0.11%

D: 0.14%

E: 0.25%

F: 0.032%

G: 0.075%

H: 0.466%

I: 0.5%

J: 0.20%

So 0.1069% is approximately 0.11%, which is option C. So I think the answer is C.

To determine the percentage of sulfur in the tomato, we calculate the mass of sulfur in the BaSO4 precipitate and then find its percentage relative to the tomato's total mass.

1. **Molar Mass of BaSO4**:  
   - Barium (Ba): 137.33 g/mol  
   - Sulfur (S): 32.07 g/mol  
   - Oxygen (O): 16.00 g/mol × 4 = 64.00 g/mol  
   - Total: 137.33 + 32.07 + 64.00 = **233.40 g/mol**

2. **Moles of BaSO4**:  
   - Mass of BaSO4 = 0.466 g  
   - Moles of BaSO4 = \( \frac{0.466 \, \text{g}}{233.40 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.002 \, \text{mol} \)

3. **Moles of Sulfur**:  
   - Each mole of BaSO4 contains 1 mole of S, so moles of S = 0.002 mol.

4. **Mass of Sulfur**:  
   - Molar mass of S = 32.07 g/mol  
   - Mass of S = \( 0.002 \, \text{mol} \times 32.07 \, \text{g/mol} = 0.06414 \, \text{g} \)

5. **Percentage of Sulfur in Tomato**:  
   - Mass of tomato = 60.0 g  
   - Percentage of S = \( \frac{0.06414 \, \text{g}}{60.0 \, \text{g}} \times 100\% \approx 0.107\% \)

6. **Closest Option**:  
   The calculated percentage (0.107%) rounds to **0.11%**, which corresponds to **Option C**.

**Answer: C**
