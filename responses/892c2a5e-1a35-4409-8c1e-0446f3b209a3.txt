Okay, so I've got this problem here where a person weighs 62 kg, and their drug dose is 15 mg per kilogram. I need to figure out how many grams that dose is. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.

First, I know that the dose is calculated by multiplying the weight by the dose per kilogram. So that would be 62 kg multiplied by 15 mg/kg. Let me do that math: 62 times 15. Well, 60 times 15 is 900, and 2 times 15 is 30, so adding those together gives me 930 mg. Wait, but the options are in grams, so I need to convert mg to grams.

I remember that 1 gram is equal to 1000 milligrams. So to convert mg to grams, I divide by 1000. So 930 mg divided by 1000 equals 0.93 grams. Let me check the options again. Option B is 0.93, so that should be the correct answer.

Wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Did I multiply correctly? 62 times 15: 60*15=900, 2*15=30, total 930 mg. Yep, that's right. Then converting to grams by dividing by 1000 gives 0.93 grams. Yep, that seems correct. I don't think I missed anything here.

The calculation involves multiplying the weight (62 kg) by the dose per kilogram (15 mg/kg) to get 930 mg. Converting mg to grams by dividing by 1000 gives 0.93 grams, which corresponds to option B.

Answer: B
