Question:

A previously healthy 15-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department in August 1 hour after the onset of headache, dizziness, nausea, and one episode of vomiting. His symptoms began during the first hour of full-contact football practice in full uniform. He reported feeling weak and faint but did not lose consciousness. He vomited once after drinking water. On arrival, he is diaphoretic. He is not oriented to person, place, or time. His temperature is 39.5°C (103.1°F), pulse is 120/min, respirations are 40/min, and blood pressure is 90/65 mm Hg. Examination, including neurologic examination, shows no other abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?

Options:

A: Administer an epinephrine injection
B: Administer oxygen via a nasal cannula
C: Perform a lumbar puncture
D: Immerse the patient in an ice water bath
E: Apply cold compresses to the forehead
F: Obtain a CT scan of the head
G: Administer a dose of ibuprofen
H: Administer intravenous fluids
I: Administer sodium chloride tablets
J: Administer a glucose injection

Okay, so I've got this question about a 15-year-old boy who's in the ER with some symptoms. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the patient is a healthy 15-year-old who came in August, which is a hot month. He started feeling unwell during football practice. His symptoms include headache, dizziness, nausea, and vomiting. He also felt weak and faint but didn't lose consciousness. After drinking water, he vomited once. On arrival, he's diaphoretic, which means he's sweating a lot. He's not oriented to person, place, or time, which is concerning because that's a sign of altered mental status. His vital signs are: temp 39.5°C (103.1°F), pulse 120/min, respirations 40/min, BP 90/65 mm Hg. The exam, including neurology, shows no other issues.

So, what's going on here? The key points are the high temperature, altered mental status, and the setting—he was at football practice in full uniform, which might mean he was exercising in the heat. So heat-related illness comes to mind, probably heatstroke.

Heatstroke is a medical emergency. It's when the body's temperature regulation fails, leading to a very high body temperature (usually above 40°C or 104°F). Symptoms can include confusion, altered mental status, nausea, vomiting, high heart rate, rapid breathing, and low blood pressure. In this case, the patient's temp is 39.5°C, which is pretty high but maybe early in the progression. His BP is 90/65, which is low, and his pulse and respirations are elevated. He's not oriented, which is a red flag.

Now, the question is about the next step in management. Let's look at the options:

A: Administer an epinephrine injection – That's for anaphylaxis or severe allergic reactions. Doesn't seem relevant here.

B: Administer oxygen via a nasal cannula – He's breathing pretty fast at 40/min, but I'm not sure if oxygen is the first step unless there's a specific indication like hypoxia, which isn't mentioned.

C: Perform a lumbar puncture – That's for suspected meningitis. His symptoms could overlap, but without specific signs like stiff neck or positive meningeal signs, this might not be the first step. Plus, heatstroke can cause confusion, so it's a consideration, but LP is invasive.

D: Immerse the patient in an ice water bath – This is a classic treatment for heatstroke. Rapid cooling is essential. So this seems like a strong candidate.

E: Apply cold compresses to the forehead – That's a common first aid measure, but full-body immersion is more effective for cooling.

F: Obtain a CT scan of the head – Indicated if there's suspicion of a neurological issue like a stroke or bleed. But without other signs like focal deficits or evidence of increased intracranial pressure, this might not be necessary immediately.

G: Administer a dose of ibuprofen – NSAIDs can help with fever but might not address the underlying heat issue and could have risks if he's dehydrated.

H: Administer intravenous fluids – Rehydration is important in heatstroke, especially if he's dehydrated. But the priority is cooling first.

I: Administer sodium chloride tablets – For dehydration, but again, cooling is more immediate.

J: Administer a glucose injection – Only if there's concern for hypoglycemia, which isn't indicated here.

So, the most critical step is to reduce his body temperature quickly. Options D and E are cooling methods. Immersing in ice water is more effective than just cold compresses on the forehead. So D would be the best next step.

Wait, but sometimes they might start with ice packs and fans, but in severe cases, ice bath is better. Since he's in the ER, they can do an ice bath right away. So D is the answer.

The patient presents with symptoms consistent with heatstroke, characterized by a high fever, altered mental status, and vital sign abnormalities. Immediate cooling is essential to prevent complications. Immersing the patient in an ice water bath is the most effective method for rapid cooling, making option D the appropriate next step.

Answer: D
