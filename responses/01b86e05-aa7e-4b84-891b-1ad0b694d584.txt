Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the correct answer to this law question. Let me read it carefully and break it down step by step.

The scenario is about a retiree and his wife who were accosted by a man outside their apartment. The man uses a gun to force them into their apartment, where he then blindfolds and ties them up with duct tape. He steals the retiree's wallet and jewelry, then leaves. After he's gone, the retiree struggles and has a heart attack, leading to his death.

The question is about what charges the man should face. The options are a mix of burglary, robbery, involuntary manslaughter, murder, etc.

First, I need to recall the definitions of these crimes to see which apply.

Burglary: Typically defined as the unlawful entry into a building with the intent to commit a felony inside. So, if the man entered the apartment with the intent to commit theft or another felony, that's burglary.

Robbery: The taking of property with force or threat of immediate force. In this case, the man brandished a gun, which is an immediate threat, and took the wallet and jewelry. So robbery definitely applies.

Involuntary Manslaughter: This occurs when someone's death results from the commission of a misdemeanor or a felony that's not inherently dangerous. If during the commission of a felony (like robbery), someone dies, but it's not intentional, it could be involuntary manslaughter.

Murder: This requires intent to kill or cause death. Since the man didn't intend to kill the retiree, it's more likely manslaughter than murder.

Now, looking at the timeline. The man entered the apartment with a gun, tied them up, and stole the items. So that's both burglary and robbery. Then, when he leaves, the retiree struggles and dies. The question is whether the man is liable for the death.

Involuntary manslaughter can be charged if the death occurred during the commission of a felony. Since robbery is a felony, and the death happened after the robbery was completed but during their escape (or in this case, the retiree struggling after the robbery), it might still fall under the felony-murder rule. However, the felony-murder rule can be tricky because it depends on whether the death occurred during the commission of the felony or as a result of it.

Wait, but in this case, after the robbery, the man had left the apartment. The death happened when the retiree was trying to free himself after the man had already left. So was the death during the commission of the robbery or after?

If the felony is completed (the robbery is done when he exits), then the death might not fall under felony-murder. But some jurisdictions might still apply felony-murder if the death happens in immediate flight from the crime. Or perhaps the struggle was a direct result of the robbery.

Alternatively, the man could be charged with involuntary manslaughter based on the misdemeanor manslaughter rule. If the retiree's death was a result of the unlawful act (like tying them up with duct tape), which could be a misdemeanor or felony.

But wait, tying them up and using duct tape could be considered as part of the robbery and burglary, but also as an assault. So, if during the commission of a felony (robbery or burglary), a death occurs, it could be felony-murder. However, if the death happened after the felony was completed, it might not apply. So the timing is crucial.

If the death occurred after the felony was completed, perhaps the charge would be involuntary manslaughter based on the unlawful act (like the duct taping leading to the heart attack). But I'm not entirely sure.

Looking at the options, option E is robbery, burglary, and involuntary manslaughter. Option F adds murder, but I don't think it's murder because there was no intent. Option G is robbery and murder, which doesn't fit. Option A is burglary and involuntary manslaughter, but I think robbery also applies because there was use of force.

So, putting it together, the man committed burglary (unlawful entry with intent to commit a felony), robbery (theft with force), and the death was a result of his actions during the commission of the felony, so involuntary manslaughter.

Therefore, the correct answer would be E: robbery, burglary, and involuntary manslaughter.

The man committed burglary by unlawfully entering the apartment with the intent to commit robbery. He also committed robbery by using a gun to steal the retiree's property. The retiree's death, resulting from the unlawful acts (tying up with duct tape), constitutes involuntary manslaughter. Therefore, the charges are robbery, burglary, and involuntary manslaughter.

Answer: E
