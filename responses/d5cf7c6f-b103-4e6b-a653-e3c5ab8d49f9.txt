Considering:
1. "That united in a single Republic, the provinces of Venezuela and the New Granada have all proportions and ways to elevate themselves to a higher grade of power and prosperity.
2. "That constituted in separate republics, for any more stronger the ties that these have united them, so far from taking advantages of so many advantages, they would hardly consolidate and make respect their sovereignty.
3. "That these truths, highly penetrated by superior talented men and of an enlightened patriotism, had moved the governments of both republics to convene in a reunion that the vicissitudes of wars decreed and decree the following fundamental Law of the Republic of Colombia:

Answer:

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here, and I need to figure out the answer. Let me read through it carefully.

The question is about which option would most undermine the expectations expressed in Article 1 of Source 1. Source 1 is the Fundamental Law of the Republic of Colombia, which was passed in 1819. Article 1 of this law says that the Republics of Venezuela and New Granada are united into a single Republic called Colombia. So, the expectation here is that these two regions would form a unified state.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: Intervention by the US and European powers in the independence of Latin American countries. Hmm, US and European intervention might have destabilized these new nations, but would that directly undermine the unity between Venezuela and New Granada? Possibly, but I'm not sure if it's the most direct.

Option B: Nationalism in Latin America pressing for stronger unity. Wait, stronger unity would actually support the expectations in Article 1, not undermine them. So this might not be the answer.

Option C: Slave rebellions fragmenting newly independent states. Slave rebellions could cause internal conflict and weaken a country, but does that directly affect the unity between Venezuela and New Granada? Maybe indirectly, but not sure.

Option D: Sectionalism of elites in the various territories. Sectionalism refers to when different regions have their own interests and might oppose a central government. If the elites in each region are more focused on their own areas rather than the unified state, that would definitely undermine the unity. This seems like a strong candidate.

So, thinking about it, the key here is what would undermine the expectation of unity. Source 1 is about uniting Venezuela and New Granada into Colombia. If sectionalism among elites occurs, they might push for their regions to have more autonomy or even break away, which would weaken the union. That sounds like it would directly go against the expectations of Article 1.

Option A, while possible, is more about external interference which might lead to other issues, but not necessarily the internal unity. Option C is about internal conflict but perhaps more about social issues rather than political unity. Option B is actually supporting the union, so it's not the answer.

Therefore, I think the correct answer is D: Sectionalism of elites in the various territories.
