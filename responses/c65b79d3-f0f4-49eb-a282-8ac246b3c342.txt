Okay, so I've got this question about muscle fibers and which type fatigues first during all-out exercise like sprinting. Hmm, I remember that muscle fibers are categorized into different types based on their characteristics, like how they contract, their speed, and their endurance.

Alright, the question is asking about the first fibers to fatigue during sprinting. Sprinting is a high-intensity, short-duration activity. So I think it's related to the types of muscle fibers that are used during such exercises.

I recall that there are Type I and Type II fibers. Type I fibers are slow-twitch, which means they're more endurance-oriented. They're used in activities that require sustained effort over time, like running long distances. On the other hand, Type II fibers are fast-twitch, which are more explosive and used for quick, powerful movements like sprinting or lifting heavy weights.

Wait, but Type II fibers themselves are divided into IIa and IIb, right? IIa are sometimes called intermediate fibers, and IIb are the pure fast-twitch. I think IIb fibers fatigue more quickly because they rely more on anaerobic respiration, which uses up glycogen faster and produces more lactic acid. That would lead to quicker fatigue.

So during a sprint, which is a short burst of maximum effort, the body would primarily use the fast-twitch fibers. Among these, the IIb fibers are the first to get tired because they can't sustain the effort as long as the IIa or Type I fibers. So the first to fatigue would be Type IIb.

Looking back at the options, option I is Type IIb. So the answer should be I.

The first muscle fibers to fatigue during all-out exercise like sprinting are the Type IIb fibers, which are fast-twitch and used for short bursts of intense activity.
