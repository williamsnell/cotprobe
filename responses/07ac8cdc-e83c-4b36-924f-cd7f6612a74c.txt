Okay, so I have this thermodynamics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question is about calculating the amount of work required in two different scenarios. 

Part a) asks for the work needed to freeze 100g of water at 0°C when the surroundings are at 25°C. Part b) is about withdrawing the same amount of heat from a body at 10^-5 K when the surroundings are at 1 K. The question specifies to assume perfect thermodynamic efficiency, which I think means we're dealing with a reversible process, so I can use the Carnot cycle equations.

First, I'll tackle part a). Freezing water at 0°C to ice at 0°C. I remember that the heat released when water freezes is the heat of fusion. The formula for the heat Q is mass (m) multiplied by the latent heat (L). For water, the latent heat of fusion is about 334 J/g. 

So for 100g, Q = 100g * 334 J/g = 33,400 J, which is 33.4 kJ. But wait, the problem is about work required. Since we're freezing water, we're removing heat from the water and expelling it into the surroundings. But the work done in a refrigeration cycle is related to the heat extracted and the efficiency.

Wait, but the problem says "the amount of work required." Since it's a perfect efficiency, perhaps it's just the heat extracted? No, wait, in a Carnot refrigerator, the coefficient of performance (COP) is the heat removed divided by the work input. COP = Qc / W, where Qc is the heat extracted from the cold reservoir (water at 0°C) and W is the work done.

The surroundings are at 25°C, which is 298 K, and the water is at 0°C, which is 273 K. So the COP for a refrigerator is (Tc / (Th - Tc)), where Tc is the cold reservoir temperature and Th is the hot reservoir temperature.

Let me compute that: Tc = 273 K, Th = 298 K. So COP = 273 / (298 - 273) = 273 / 25 = 10.92. 

So COP = Qc / W → W = Qc / COP. Qc is the heat extracted, which is 33.4 kJ. So W = 33.4 kJ / 10.92 ≈ 3.06 kJ. Hmm, looking at the options, option A says a) 3.07 kJ, which matches this. But I should check the other options too.

Now part b). It's about withdrawing the same amount of heat (33.4 kJ) from a body at 10^-5 K with surroundings at 1 K. Again, assuming perfect efficiency, so using the Carnot cycle again, but this time as a heat pump? Or wait, if we're withdrawing heat, it's a refrigerator scenario.

Wait, in part b), the body is at 10^-5 K, and the surroundings are at 1 K. So the cold reservoir is at Tc = 1e-5 K, and the hot reservoir is Th = 1 K. Wait, that seems a bit odd because Th should be higher than Tc. Oh wait, no, Th is the surroundings, which are at 1 K, and the body is at 1e-5 K, which is colder. So we're removing heat from a colder body into the surroundings, which is at 1 K. So this would be a heat pump scenario, but wait no, because heat naturally flows from hot to cold. To pump heat from a colder reservoir to a hotter one, you need work input.

Wait, but in part b), is the heat being removed from the body (1e-5 K) and expelled into the surroundings (1 K)? So in this case, the process is acting as a refrigerator, extracting heat from the cold reservoir (1e-5 K) and expelling it into the hot reservoir (1 K). So the COP would be (Tc / (Th - Tc)).

Wait, but Th is 1 K and Tc is 1e-5 K. So the denominator is 1 - 1e-5 ≈ 1 approximately. So COP ≈ (1e-5) / (1 - 1e-5) ≈ 1e-5 / 1 ≈ 1e-5. That's a very low COP.

But wait, in reality, when the temperatures are very close, the COP approaches 1, but here Tc is much lower than Th. Wait no, in this case, Th is 1 K, Tc is 1e-5 K. So the COP for a refrigerator is COP = Tc/(Th - Tc). So that's (1e-5 K) / (1 K - 1e-5 K) ≈ 1e-5 / 1 = 1e-5. So very low.

The COP is Qc/W, where Qc is the heat extracted from the cold reservoir. We need to find W, the work required. So W = Qc / COP. Qc is the same as part a), which is 33.4 kJ. So W = 33.4 kJ / (1e-5) = 33.4e5 kJ = 3.34e6 kJ. Wait, but looking at the options, let me see.

Wait, wait, maybe I'm getting the COP formula wrong. Because in part a), the COP was for a refrigerator, so Qc is the heat extracted, and W is the work input. So COP = Qc / W.

In part b), same COP formula applies. COP = Tc/(Th - Tc) = (1e-5)/(1 - 1e-5) ≈ 1e-5.

So W = Qc / COP = 33.4 kJ / (1e-5) = 33.4e5 kJ = 3.34e6 kJ. But looking at the options, none of them have 3.34e6 kJ as the answer for part b). Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options, option E for part b) is 33.6 × 10^5 kJ, which is 3.36e6 kJ. That's very close to what I calculated. So for part b), the work would be about 3.36e6 kJ, which is 33.6 ×10^5 kJ. 

But wait, option E for part a) is 3.07 kJ, which matches part a), and part b) is 33.6e5 kJ. So option E would have a) 3.07 kJ and b) 33.6e5 kJ. Let me check which option that is. Option E is a) 3.07, b)33.6e5. So that's E.

But wait, let me think again. Because in part b), the surroundings are at 1 K, and the body is at 1e-5 K. So the system is acting as a heat pump, but wait no, if we're removing heat from the body and expelling it into the surroundings, which are at higher temperature (1 K is higher than 1e-5 K), so it's a refrigerator. So the COP is as I calculated.

Wait, but another thought: when the temperatures are so close, the COP approaches 1, but here, with such a small Tc, the COP is very low, making the work required extremely high. So 33.4 kJ / 1e-5 is 3.34e6 kJ, which is 33.6 ×10^5 kJ as in option E.

But wait, the options for part b) are:

Option A: 1e5 kJ
B:66.5e5
C:1e4
D:2.07e5
E:33.6e5
F:8.31e5
G:5e5
H:12.34e5
I:33.6e5
J:3.07e5

So option E's part b) is 33.6e5, which matches. So the correct answer would be E: a)3.07 kJ, b)33.6e5 kJ.

Wait, but in the initial part a), I thought the work was 3.07 kJ, which is option E's a). So I think E is the correct option.
</think>

The work required to freeze 100g of water at 0°C when the surroundings are at 25°C is calculated using the Carnot refrigerator formula. The heat extracted (Qc) is 33.4 kJ, and the coefficient of performance (COP) is 10.92, leading to a work input of approximately 3.07 kJ. For part b), withdrawing the same heat from a body at 10^-5 K with surroundings at 1 K, the COP is extremely low (~1e-5), resulting in a work input of about 33.6 × 10^5 kJ. Thus, the correct answer is:

E: a) 3.07 kJ, b) 33.6 × 10^5 kJ.
