Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by understanding what the question is asking.

The question says: Calculate the heat transferred when 100J of work is done on a system consisting of 1 mole of an ideal gas. The system is at constant temperature, and it mentions that ΔE = 0 for the expansion of an ideal gas.

Hmm, wait, ΔE is the change in internal energy. For an ideal gas, I remember that the internal energy depends only on temperature. So if the temperature is constant, ΔE should indeed be zero. That makes sense.

Now, the first law of thermodynamics is what connects heat (Q), work (W), and change in internal energy (ΔE). The formula is ΔE = Q + W. But wait, I need to get the signs right. In physics, work done on the system is considered positive, while work done by the system is negative. Also, heat entering the system is positive, and heat leaving is negative.

In this case, the work done is 100J on the system. So W would be positive 100J. But wait, the problem says "work is done on the system", so yes, W is +100J.

Given ΔE is zero, let's plug into the equation: 0 = Q + 100J. Solving for Q gives Q = -100J. So the heat transferred is -100J, which means heat is leaving the system.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm not getting confused with the system's perspective. The system is the gas. If work is done on the gas, it's being compressed, right? But wait, the problem says it's an expansion. Oh wait, no, wait. The problem says "expansion of an ideal gas" when talking about ΔE. Oh, maybe I'm mixing up the expansion.

Wait, no, the problem says the system is the gas, and the work is done on the system. So if work is done on the system, the system is being compressed, not expanding. But wait, the question states that the system is at constant temperature, and ΔE is zero for expansion. Hmm, perhaps the system is expanding, but the work is done on it, which would imply that the work is negative? Or maybe I'm getting the sign conventions mixed up.

Wait, another approach: For an ideal gas expanding at constant temperature, the internal energy change is zero because ΔE = n Cv ΔT, and ΔT is zero here. So regardless of expansion or compression, as long as T is constant, ΔE is zero.

So using ΔE = Q + W. Since ΔE is zero, Q = -W. Now, W is the work done by the system. If the system does work (expands), then W is positive, and Q would be negative. But in this problem, the work is done on the system, which would mean the work is negative from the system's perspective. Wait, this is getting a bit confusing.

Wait, let me clarify the sign conventions. In physics, usually, work done by the system is considered positive. So if work is done on the system, it's negative. So if 100J of work is done on the system, then W is -100J (since the system is having work done on it, so it's work done by the surroundings on the system). But wait, in the formula ΔE = Q + W, W is the work done on the system. Wait, no, in some conventions, W is the work done by the system. I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, let me check the formula again. The first law is often written as ΔE = Q - W, where W is the work done by the system. So if work is done on the system, W is negative, making the equation ΔE = Q + |W|.

Alternatively, another convention is ΔE = Q + W, where W is the work done on the system. So in this case, if W is positive when work is done on the system, then in the problem, W is +100J.

Wait, the problem states that work is done on the system, so W is positive 100J. So using ΔE = Q + W, and ΔE is zero, then Q = -100J.

So the heat transferred is -100J, which means heat is leaving the system. That makes sense because if work is done on the system (compression), but the temperature doesn't change, the internal energy doesn't change, so the excess heat must be released.

Looking at the options, A is -100J, which would be the correct answer.

But wait, let me double-check. If the system is doing work, W is negative. But in this case, work is done on the system, so W is positive. So yes, Q = -W = -100J.
</think>

The problem involves calculating the heat transferred when 100J of work is done on a system consisting of 1 mole of an ideal gas at constant temperature, where ΔE = 0. Using the first law of thermodynamics, ΔE = Q + W, and knowing that ΔE is zero, we solve for Q: Q = -W. Since work is done on the system, W is positive 100J, making Q = -100J. This indicates that heat is leaving the system.

Answer: A
