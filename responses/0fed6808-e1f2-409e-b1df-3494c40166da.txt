Question:

A model of a proposed low-speed crop-dusting plane is to be tested in a wind tunnel capable of maintaining velocities of 264 ft/s, using atmospheric air. The prototype plane has a design wing span of 27 ft and a proposed speed of 88 ft/s. In order to preserve dynamic similarity, what should be the wing span of the model if the wind tunnel is to operate at full speed? Assume the air at these low velocities to be essentially incompressible. In addition, assume that the temperature of atmospheric air and the temperature of the wind-tunnel air are the same.

Options:

A: 9 ft
B: 30 ft
C: 3 ft
D: 6 ft
E: 15 ft
F: 21 ft
G: 12 ft
H: 18 ft
I: 24 ft
J: 27 ft

Okay, so I've got this question about a model of a crop-dusting plane being tested in a wind tunnel. I'm a bit rusty on my fluid mechanics, but let me try to think through this.

The question is about dynamic similarity, which I remember has to do with making sure the model behaves the same way as the prototype under the conditions tested. So, dynamic similarity probably means matching some key dimensionless numbers, like Reynolds number, because the problem mentions incompressible air, so maybe we don't have to worry about Mach numbers here.

The given data:
- Prototype wing span (B_proto) is 27 ft.
- Prototype speed (V_proto) is 88 ft/s.
- Wind tunnel speed (V_model) is 264 ft/s.
- We need to find the model's wing span (B_model).

Dynamic similarity in fluid mechanics often requires that the Reynolds number for the model equals that of the prototype. Reynolds number (Re) is given by Re = (V * L) / ν, where V is velocity, L is a characteristic length (like wing span for a plane), and ν is the kinematic viscosity.

Since the air temperature is the same in both the prototype and the wind tunnel, the kinematic viscosity ν should be the same for both. So, the Reynolds number for the model and prototype must be equal for dynamic similarity.

So, Re_model = Re_proto.

Putting that into the equation: (V_model * B_model) / ν = (V_proto * B_proto) / ν.

Wait, since ν is the same for both, it cancels out. So, V_model * B_model = V_proto * B_proto.

We can rearrange this to find B_model = (V_proto / V_model) * B_proto.

Plugging in the numbers:

V_proto is 88 ft/s, V_model is 264 ft/s. So, 88 divided by 264 equals 1/3. So, 1/3 times the prototype's wing span of 27 ft.

27 ft times 1/3 is 9 ft. So, the model's wing span should be 9 ft.

Looking at the options, option A is 9 ft. So, I think the answer is A.

The wing span of the model should be 9 ft to maintain dynamic similarity.

Answer: A
