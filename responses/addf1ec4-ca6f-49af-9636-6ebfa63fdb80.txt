Okay, so I have this finance problem here, and I need to figure out the answers for parts a, b, and c. The question is about compound interest, which I remember is when interest is calculated on the initial principal and also on the accumulated interest from previous periods. Let me take it step by step.

First, the problem says I invest $1,000 at 4 percent interest, compounded annually. I need to find the balance after 10 years under three different scenarios: (a) no further deposits or withdrawals, (b) depositing $30 at the beginning of each year, and (c) withdrawing $30 at the end of each year.

Let me start with part (a). I think the formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where:
- A is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.
- P is the principal amount ($1,000).
- r is the annual interest rate (4%, so 0.04).
- n is the number of times that interest is compounded per year (1 for annually).
- t is the time the money is invested for in years (10).

So plugging in the numbers: A = 1000*(1 + 0.04/1)^(1*10) = 1000*(1.04)^10.

I need to calculate 1.04^10. I remember that 1.04^10 is approximately 1.4802. So A ≈ 1000 * 1.4802 = $1,480.20. Looking at the options, H has $1,480.50, which is close but maybe the exact calculation is a bit higher. Let me check more precisely: 1.04^10 is actually about 1.4802442849. So 1000 * that is $1,480.24. Hmm, none of the options exactly match that. Wait, option H is $1,480, which is close but the exact value is around 1,480.24. So perhaps it's rounded to 1,480.24, but looking at the options, H has $1,480, which is correct when rounded to the nearest dollar. Alternatively, option F has 1,485.50, which is higher, so that's probably not right. Option H's first value is 1,480, which seems correct for part a.

Moving on to part (b): depositing $30 at the beginning of each year, including the tenth. Since the deposits are made at the beginning, this is an annuity due. The formula for the future value of an annuity due is FV = PMT * [(1 - (1 + r)^-n)/r] * (1 + r), where PMT is the annual payment ($30), r is 0.04, and n is 10.

Alternatively, I can think of it as each payment is made at the start, so each one earns interest for one more year than if it were made at the end. So the first $30 deposited at year 0 will earn interest for 10 years, the next $30 at year 1 earns 9 years, and so on.

The formula simplifies to FV = PMT * [( (1 + r)^n - 1 ) / r ].

Wait, no, the standard formula for annuity due is FV = PMT * [ ( (1 + r)^n - 1 ) / r ] * (1 + r). Wait, no, actually, I think I made a mistake. The future value of an annuity due is the same as the future value of an ordinary annuity multiplied by (1 + r). Because each payment is made at the beginning, so each gets an extra period of interest.

Alternatively, the formula can be written as FV = PMT * [ ( (1 + r)^n - 1 ) / r ] * (1 + r). Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me double-check.

The correct formula for the future value of an annuity due is FV = PMT * [ ( (1 + r)^n - 1 ) / r ] * (1 + r). Wait, no, actually, it's FV = PMT * [ ( (1 + r)^n - 1 ) / r ] multiplied by (1 + r). Hmm, maybe I should just calculate it step by step.

Alternatively, for an ordinary annuity, the formula is FV = PMT * [ ( (1 + r)^n - 1 ) / r ]. But since it's an annuity due, each payment earns one more period of interest, so we multiply the ordinary annuity factor by (1 + r).

So for part b, the future value from the annuity due would be 30 * [ (1.04^10 - 1)/0.04 ] * 1.04.

First, calculate (1.04^10 -1)/0.04. We know 1.04^10 ≈1.480244, so 1.480244 -1=0.480244. Divided by 0.04 is 12.0061. Then multiply by 1.04: 12.0061 *1.04 ≈12.4863.

Then FV =30 *12.4863 ≈374.589. Now, add this to the initial investment's future value from part a, which was approximately $1,480.24. So total FV would be 1480.24 + 374.589 ≈$1,854.83.

Looking at the options, H has $1,854.81 for part b, which is very close. So I think that's correct.

Now part (c): withdrawing $30 at the end of each year. This is an ordinary annuity, where we're making withdrawals, so the future value will be less than the initial investment's growth. The formula is similar to part b but without the extra (1 + r) factor because payments are at the end.

The formula is FV = -PMT * [ ( (1 + r)^n - 1 ) / r ].

Wait, but since it's a withdrawal, the future value will be the initial amount minus the future value of the withdrawals. Alternatively, since we're withdrawing, the formula becomes:

FV = P*(1+r)^n + PMT * [ ( (1 + r)^n - 1 ) / r ] but with PMT negative because it's a withdrawal.

Wait, no, the formula for the future value when making regular withdrawals (as opposed to deposits) is different. Let me think: the initial amount earns interest, and each year we take out $30, which reduces the principal each year, but the interest is calculated on the remaining balance.

Alternatively, the future value is the initial investment's growth minus the future value of the withdrawals. So:

FV = P*(1 + r)^n - PMT * [ ( (1 + r)^n - 1 ) / r ]

So plugging in the numbers: P=1000, r=0.04, n=10, PMT=30.

First, calculate the initial investment's future value: 1000*(1.04)^10 ≈1000*1.480244≈1480.24.

Then the future value of the withdrawals: 30 * [ (1.04^10 -1)/0.04 ] =30*(0.480244/0.04)=30*12.0061≈360.183.

So FV =1480.24 - 360.183 ≈1120.057.

Looking at the options, H's third value is $1,120.07, which matches closely. So for part c, the answer is approximately $1,120.07.

Let me cross-check the options. Option H is: a) $1,480, b) $1,854.81, c) $1,120.07. That matches exactly what I calculated.

The correct calculations for each part are as follows:

(a) The future value of $1,000 at 4% compounded annually for 10 years is approximately $1,480.24, which rounds to $1,480.  
(b) The future value with $30 deposited at the beginning of each year is approximately $1,854.81.  
(c) The future value after withdrawing $30 at the end of each year is approximately $1,120.07.
