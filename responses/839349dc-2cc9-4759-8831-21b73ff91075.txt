Question:

A 57-year-old man receives radiation therapy for a squamous cell carcinoma of the lung. Despite therapy, the tumor progressively increases in size, and he dies 6 months later. His tumor cells contain a point mutation in the p53 gene (TP53), leading to an inactive gene product. Based on this finding, the progressive tumor growth despite irradiation therapy is most likely to be related to a defect in cell cycle arrest in which of the following phases of the cell cycle?

Options:

A: Metaphase
B: G1
C: Prophase
D: G0
E: Prometaphase
F: S phase
G: Anaphase
H: M
I: Telophase
J: G2

Okay, so I've got this question about a patient with lung cancer and how his tumor grew despite radiation therapy. The key point is that his tumor cells have a point mutation in the p53 gene, making it inactive. I remember that p53 is a tumor suppressor gene, so when it's not working, the cell can't control the cell cycle properly.

Wait, the question is about cell cycle arrest phases. So, I need to think about where p53 plays a role. From what I've studied, p53 is involved in regulating the G1 phase of the cell cycle. When there's DNA damage, p53 gets activated, and it either stops the cell cycle at the G1 phase to allow for DNA repair or, if the damage is too severe, triggers apoptosis.

In this case, the man didn't respond to radiation, which usually damages DNA. If p53 isn't working, the cells can't arrest in G1 to repair the damage, so they proceed into S phase, leading to more mutations and uncontrolled growth. So the tumor grows because there's no arrest in G1.

Looking at the options, G1 is option B. Other phases like M phase or G2 might not be as directly related to p53's role in DNA damage response. So the answer should be B, G1.

The p53 gene is a tumor suppressor that plays a critical role in regulating the G1 phase of the cell cycle. When p53 is inactive due to a mutation, cells cannot properly arrest in G1 to repair DNA damage, leading to unchecked cell cycle progression and tumor growth. This explains why the tumor progressed despite radiation therapy.

Answer: B
