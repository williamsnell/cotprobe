Question:

An investor owned a four-story office building located in downtown. The building was old and badly in need of renovation. To finance the improvements, the investor borrowed $125,000 from his friend. As consideration for the loan, the investor executed a promissory note for $125,000 payable to the friend in one year and secured by a mortgage on the building. The mortgage was dated January 1, and was recorded January 2. Thereafter, on February 1, the investor executed a deed absolute on the building and named the friend as grantee. This deed, although absolute in form, was intended only as additional security for the payment of the debt. In order to make judicial foreclosure unnecessary and to eliminate the right to redeem, the investor then delivered the deed to his nephew in escrow with instructions to deliver the deed to the friend if the investor failed to pay his promissory note at maturity. On January 1 of the following year, the investor failed to pay the note when it came due. Thereupon, the nephew, in accordance with the escrow instructions, delivered the investor's deed on the office building to the friend, which the friend promptly and properly recorded. Two weeks later, the investor tendered the $125,000 indebtedness to the friend. When the friend refused to accept it, the investor brought an appropriate action to set aside and cancel the deed absolute and to permit the redemption of the building from the friend. Conversely, the friend counterclaimed to quiet title and argued that the deed absolute was intended as an outright conveyance upon default. The court should enter a judgment that will grant the relief sought by

Options:

A: the investor, but only if the investor can establish that the mortgage takes precedence over the deed absolute because it was executed earlier in time.
B: the friend, because the deed absolute effectuated an outright conveyance that extinguished the redemption interest sought to be retained by the investor.
C: the friend, because the investor has no right to redeem after the deed absolute was executed.
D: the friend, if the friend can establish that the deed absolute was executed later in time.
E: the investor, because the deed absolute did not extinguish his right of redemption.
F: the friend, because the investor failed to pay his promissory note at maturity.
G: the investor, because the friend refused to accept the $125,000 indebtedness.
H: the investor, if the investor can prove that the deed was intended only as additional security for the payment of the debt.
I: the investor, because the deed absolute was not intended as an outright conveyance upon default.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this legal question about mortgages and deeds. Let's break it down step by step. 

So, the situation is an investor who owns a four-story office building. The building is old and needs renovation, so he borrows $125,000 from his friend. To secure the loan, he executes a promissory note for $125,000 due in a year and gives a mortgage on the building. The mortgage is dated January 1 and recorded on January 2.

Then, on February 1, the investor executes a deed absolute (which is a type of deed) naming his friend as the grantee. The deed is absolute in form, but it was intended only as additional security for the debt. So, it's not a full conveyance; it's just meant to secure the loan.

After that, to avoid a judicial foreclosure and eliminate the right to redeem, the investor delivers this deed to his nephew in escrow. The instructions are to deliver the deed to the friend if the investor fails to pay the promissory note at maturity. So, it's like a contingency: if he can't pay, the deed goes to the friend.

On January 1 of the following year, the investor doesn't pay the note, so the nephew delivers the deed to the friend, who records it properly. Two weeks later, the investor tries to pay the $125,000, but the friend refuses. The investor then sues to set aside the deed and allow redemption, while the friend countersues to quiet title, arguing the deed was an outright conveyance upon default.

The question is, who should the court rule in favor of?

Looking at the options, I need to figure out whether the deed absolute was an actual conveyance or just additional security. In property law, a deed can be a conveyance or just security. If it's a conveyance, then the friend owns the property outright, and the investor can't redeem. But if it's just security (like a mortgage), then the investor might retain the right to redeem after paying the debt.

But wait, normally, a mortgage is a lien and doesn't transfer ownership. However, a deed absolute is different because it's a conveyance. But here, the deed was intended only as additional security. So, was it a true conveyance or just a mortgage?

In some jurisdictions, if a deed is delivered in escrow with conditions, it's considered a mortgage or a deed of trust, which is a type of security interest. However, if the intent is to make it a conveyance upon default, then it could be treated as a mortgage. But here, the deed was delivered to the nephew in escrow, and the instructions were to deliver it to the friend if the investor defaults. This sounds like a contingency, so when the default happens, the deed is delivered, which would transfer ownership.

Wait, but the investor intended the deed as additional security, not as a conveyance until default. So, when the deed is delivered upon default, does that mean it becomes effective only then, transferring ownership? Or was the deed intended to be a mortgage from the start?

I'm a bit confused. Normally, a mortgage is a lien and doesn't transfer title. A deed of trust, which is similar, allows the trustee (here, the nephew) to convey the property upon default. But in this case, the deed was absolute and delivered in escrow with instructions to deliver upon default. So, the initial delivery to the escrow was a conditional delivery, meaning the transfer only happens when the condition (default) occurs.

Under the theory of deeds, a deed delivered in escrow with conditions is considered a constructive conveyance. Once the condition is met, the deed becomes effective. So, when the investor defaulted, the deed was delivered, and the friend got the property. But was this intended to be a conveyance or just security?

If the intent was to have the deed as security, then delivering it upon default might not transfer title but just perfect the security interest. Or, it might transfer title, but the investor retains the right to redeem. However, if the deed was intended to transfer title upon default, then the investor loses the right to redeem.

The problem states that the deed absolute was intended only as additional security. So, perhaps the intent was that it's a security interest, not an outright transfer. But the execution of the deed upon default might have different implications.

Another point is that the mortgage was recorded earlier than the deed. The mortgage was on January 1, and the deed was on February 1. But recording doesn't affect priority if the intent is different.

The question is about whether the deed absolute extinguished the right of redemption. If the deed was a conveyance upon default, then the investor would lose the right to redeem. But if it was just additional security, then the investor might still have the right.

Wait, but in some states, a deed absolute delivered in escrow with instructions to deliver upon default is treated as a mortgage. So, it's a form of security interest, not an outright conveyance. Therefore, the investor retains the right to redeem until the debt is satisfied.

Alternatively, if the deed is delivered upon default, it might be treated as a transfer of title, so the right to redeem is extinguished.

But the problem states that the investor intended the deed as additional security, not as a conveyance. So, the intent might matter. If the intent was that the deed is just security, then the delivery upon default doesn't transfer ownership but just perfects the security.

Wait, but a deed of trust typically allows the trustee to convey the property upon default, which would transfer ownership, but the borrower can redeem by paying off the debt. So, perhaps the investor could still redeem.

In the case here, the friend refused to accept the payment after the deed was delivered. So, the issue is whether the deed's delivery extinguished the right to redeem.

Looking at the options:

Option E says the investor wins because the deed didn't extinguish his right of redemption. Option B and C say the friend wins because the deed was an outright conveyance.

But if the deed was intended as a security interest, then the investor can still redeem. But the delivery upon default might have transferred ownership. So, if the deed was a conveyance upon default, then the friend holds the property, and the investor can't redeem. But if it's just security, then the investor can redeem.

I think the key here is whether the deed was intended as a conveyance or as security. The problem says it was intended as additional security, so the delivery upon default might not have been an absolute conveyance but just a way to perfect the security interest. Therefore, the investor retains the right to redeem.

But wait, in some jurisdictions, a deed absolute delivered in escrow with instructions to deliver upon default is treated as a mortgage, and the grantor retains the equity of redemption. So, the investor can still redeem by paying the debt.

So, in that case, the friend's recording of the deed after the default wouldn't extinguish the right to redeem. Therefore, the investor can set aside the deed and redeem.

Looking at the options, option E says the investor wins because the deed didn't extinguish his right. Option H says the friend wins only if the friend can show the deed was executed later in time, which I'm not sure about.

Wait, another point: the mortgage was executed earlier and recorded first. If the deed is a mortgage, then the mortgage takes precedence. But the deed was a deed absolute, which is different.

Alternatively, if the deed was intended as a mortgage (security), then the mortgage would take effect, and the right to redeem exists.

But if the deed absolute is considered a conveyance, then the friend would own the property, and the right to redeem would be extinguished.

But the problem states that the deed was intended as additional security, not as an outright conveyance. So, it's more like a mortgage. Therefore, the investor can redeem.

So, the court should grant the investor's relief because the deed didn't extinguish his right to redeem. Therefore, option E is correct.

The court should grant the relief sought by the investor because the deed absolute did not extinguish his right of redemption. The deed was intended as additional security for the debt, not as an outright conveyance. Therefore, the investor retains the right to redeem the property by paying the debt, and the friend's refusal to accept the payment after the deed was delivered does not extinguish this right.
