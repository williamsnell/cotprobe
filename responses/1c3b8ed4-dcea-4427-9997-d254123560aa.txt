Question:

The pattern of inheritance shown by glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is:

Options:

B: Y-linked dominant.
C: autosomal dominant.
D: mitochondrial inheritance.
E: X-linked recessive.
F: codominant.
G: X-linked dominant.
H: autosomal recessive.
I: incomplete dominance.
J: non-Mendelian inheritance.

Okay, so I have this question about the pattern of inheritance for glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency. I'm a bit rusty on my genetics, but I remember that G6PD is related to enzyme deficiencies causing certain health issues, like Favism. I think the question is about whether it's X-linked, Y-linked, autosomal, etc.

Let me start by recalling what I know. G6PD is an enzyme involved in the pentose phosphate pathway, and its deficiency can lead to various conditions, especially in males. I remember that G6PD deficiency is the most common enzyme deficiency in humans. Now, how is it inherited?

I think it's sex-linked because it's located on the X chromosome. Wait, but which one? X-linked recessive or dominant? I recall that X-linked recessive conditions typically affect males more because they have only one X chromosome. Since G6PD deficiency is more common in males, that suggests it's X-linked recessive.

So, looking at the options, E is X-linked recessive. Let me double-check. The other options: A and B are Y-linked, which I don't think applies here because G6PD is on the X. C and G are autosomal or X-linked dominant, which I don't think it is because it's recessive. D is mitochondrial, which isn't the case here. H is autosomal recessive, but since it's on the X, that's not right. F is codominant, which isn't applicable. I is incomplete dominance, not the case. J is non-Mendelian, but I think it follows a Mendelian pattern, just sex-linked.

So the correct answer should be E: X-linked recessive.

The pattern of inheritance for glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is X-linked recessive. This is because the gene responsible for G6PD is located on the X chromosome, and the condition is more common in males due to their single X chromosome. Therefore, the correct answer is:

E
