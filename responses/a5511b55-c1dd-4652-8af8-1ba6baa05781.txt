Okay, so I've got this math problem here about Jack selling magazine subscriptions. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

The problem says Jack gets a commission of 85 cents for each subscription he sells. Last week, he sold 17 subscriptions. I need to find out how much his commission was. Hmm, that sounds straightforward, but I should take it slow to make sure I don't make any mistakes.

First, I think I should calculate the total commission by multiplying the commission per subscription by the number of subscriptions he sold. So that would be 85 cents times 17. 

Wait, but 85 cents is in cents, and the answer options are in dollars. Maybe I should convert the cents to dollars first to make it easier. 85 cents is equal to $0.85. Yeah, that makes sense because 100 cents make a dollar, so 85 divided by 100 is 0.85.

So now, I can multiply $0.85 by 17. Let me do that calculation. I'll write it out:

0.85 multiplied by 17. Let me break it down. 0.85 times 10 is 8.5. 0.85 times 7 is... let's see, 0.85*7 is 5.95 because 0.8*7 is 5.6 and 0.05*7 is 0.35, so adding those gives 5.95. Now, add 8.5 and 5.95 together. 

8.5 plus 5.95. Let's add the dollars first: 8 + 5 = 13. Then the cents: 0.5 + 0.95 = 1.45. Wait, that can't be right because 0.5 + 0.95 is actually 1.45, which is more than a dollar. So I should carry over the extra dollar. So 13 dollars plus 1 dollar is 14, and 0.45 cents left. So that adds up to 14.45.

Wait, but let me check that again because sometimes when I do it in my head, I might make a mistake. Alternatively, I can multiply 85 by 17 and then convert to dollars at the end. Let me try that method to confirm.

85 times 17. Let's break it down. 85 * 10 is 850, and 85 *7 is 595. So adding those together: 850 + 595. Let's see, 800 + 500 is 1300, 50 +95 is 145. So total is 1300 + 145 = 1445 cents. Now, converting 1445 cents to dollars: divide by 100, so 1445 / 100 is $14.45.

Okay, that matches what I got before. So the commission should be $14.45.

Looking at the options, option B is $14.45. So that's the answer. Wait, but let me quickly glance over the options again to make sure I didn't misread any.

Options are A:19.55, B:14.45, C:15.95, D:18.70, E:17.00, F:13.90, G:12.75, H:10.20, I:20.45, J:16.15. Yep, B is $14.45. So I'm confident that's the correct choice.

The commission is calculated by multiplying the per-subscription rate ($0.85) by the number of subscriptions (17), resulting in $14.45. 

Answer: B
