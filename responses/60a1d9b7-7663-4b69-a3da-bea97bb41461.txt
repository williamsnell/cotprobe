Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this problem about the Yum-Yum Good candy bars. Let me read it again. The average number of calories is 210, and the standard deviation is 10. The distribution is normal, so I guess I can use the properties of the normal distribution here.

The question is asking what percent of candy bars have more than 225 calories. Hmm, okay. So I need to find the percentage of values that are greater than 225 in a normal distribution with mean 210 and standard deviation 10.

First, I think I need to calculate how many standard deviations 225 is away from the mean. That's done using the z-score formula, right? So z equals (X - μ) divided by σ. Here, X is 225, μ is 210, and σ is 10.

Let me compute that: z = (225 - 210) / 10 = 15 / 10 = 1.5. So the z-score is 1.5. That means 225 calories is 1.5 standard deviations above the mean.

Now, I need to find the probability that a value is greater than 1.5 standard deviations above the mean. In a normal distribution, the area to the right of the mean is 50%, but since this is 1.5σ above, I think I need to use the standard normal distribution table or a z-table to find the area beyond z=1.5.

Wait, I remember that the z-table gives the area to the left of the z-score. So for z=1.5, the table would show the percentage of data less than 1.5σ. To find the area to the right, I subtract that value from 1.

I think the z-table value for 1.5 is around 0.9332. So the area to the left is 93.32%, which means the area to the right is 1 - 0.9332 = 0.0668, or 6.68%.

Looking at the options, option C is 6.68%, so that should be the correct answer. But wait, let me double-check the z-score and the table value.

Yes, z=1.5 is correct because 1.5 times 10 is 15, added to 210 gives 225. And the z-table for 1.5 does indeed show approximately 0.9332, so the area to the right is about 6.68%. 

I don't think I made any mistakes here. The calculation seems straightforward, and the logic checks out. So the answer must be C.

The average number of calories in Yum-Yum Good candy bars is 210, with a standard deviation of 10. To find the percentage of candy bars with more than 225 calories, we calculate the z-score:  
\[ z = \frac{225 - 210}{10} = 1.5 \]  
Using the standard normal distribution table, the area to the left of \( z = 1.5 \) is approximately 0.9332. Therefore, the area to the right (values greater than 225 calories) is \( 1 - 0.9332 = 0.0668 \), or 6.68%.  

The correct answer is C: 6.68%.
