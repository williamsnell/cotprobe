Okay, so I have this statistics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again: A company has 400 employees. Their mean income is $20,500, and the standard deviation is $3,750. The incomes are normally distributed. The question is asking how many employees we expect to have an income between $13,000 and $28,000. The options are A through J, with various numbers.

Alright, first things first, I know that when dealing with normal distributions, we can use z-scores to find probabilities. The z-score formula is z = (X - μ)/σ, where X is the value, μ is the mean, and σ is the standard deviation.

So, I need to find the probability that an employee's income is between $13,000 and $28,000. That means I'll calculate the z-scores for both 13k and 28k, find the area under the normal curve between those two z-scores, and then multiply that probability by the total number of employees (400) to get the expected number.

Let me start by calculating the z-scores.

First, for X = $13,000:
z1 = (13,000 - 20,500) / 3,750
= (-7,500) / 3,750
= -2.0

Wait, that's a z-score of -2.0. I remember that a z-score of -2 is two standard deviations below the mean. Now, for X = $28,000:
z2 = (28,000 - 20,500) / 3,750
= 7,500 / 3,750
= 2.0

So, the z-scores are -2 and +2. Now, I need to find the probability that a value falls between z = -2 and z = +2.

I remember that in a standard normal distribution, about 95% of the data lies within two standard deviations of the mean. So, the area between -2 and +2 should be approximately 0.95, or 95%.

Wait, but I should double-check this using a z-table or a calculator to be precise. Sometimes, the exact value might be slightly different than 95%. Let me think: the empirical rule says 68-95-99.7, so two SDs is about 95%, but the exact value is a bit more precise.

Looking it up, the area from z = -2 to z = +2 is approximately 0.9545, which is about 95.45%. So, that's more precise than the 95% I remembered.

So, the probability that an employee's income is between $13k and $28k is roughly 95.45%. Now, to find the expected number of employees, I multiply this probability by the total number of employees, which is 400.

Calculating that: 400 * 0.9545 = ?

Let me compute that. 400 * 0.95 is 380. 400 * 0.0045 is 1.8. So, 380 + 1.8 = 381.8. Hmm, but wait, maybe I should compute it more accurately.

Alternatively, 400 * 0.9545 = (400 * 9545)/10000. Let me compute 400 * 9545 first.

Wait, perhaps a better approach: 0.9545 is approximately 9545/10000. So, 400 * 9545 = ?

Well, 400 * 9000 = 3,600,000. 400 * 545 = 400*(500+45) = 400*500=200,000 and 400*45=18,000. So, 200,000 + 18,000 = 218,000. So total is 3,600,000 + 218,000 = 3,818,000. Then divide by 10,000: 3,818,000 / 10,000 = 381.8.

So, approximately 381.8 employees. But since we can't have a fraction of a person, we need to round this. The options given are all whole numbers. The closest option to 381.8 would be 382, but looking at the options: the choices are A:100, B:200, C:390, D:300, E:400, F:385, G:375, H:395, I:350, J:50.

Wait, 381.8 is close to 382, but the options include F:385, which is a bit higher. Let me check if I made a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps I should use a more precise z-table value. Let me think again about the z-scores. For z = 2.0, the area to the left is about 0.9772. So, the area between -2 and +2 would be 0.9772 - (1 - 0.9772) = 0.9772 - 0.0228 = 0.9544, which is about 95.44%. So, same as before.

So, 400 * 0.9544 = 381.76, which rounds to 382. But the options don't have 382. The closest higher option is F:385.

Wait, but perhaps I should check if the exact value is a little higher. Alternatively, maybe I should compute it using a calculator for more precision.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the standard normal distribution function in my mind. The area from z=-2 to z=2 is 0.9544, which is 95.44%.

So, 400 * 0.9544 = ?

Let me compute it accurately:

0.9544 * 400.

Compute 0.9544 * 400:

First, 0.95 * 400 = 380.

Then, 0.0044 * 400 = 1.76.

Adding them together, 380 + 1.76 = 381.76.

So, approximately 381.76 employees, which is about 382. But the options don't have that; the closest is F:385, which is 385. Hmm, but 381.76 is closer to 382 than to 385. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the z-scores or the area.

Wait, maybe I should check the z-scores again. For X=13,000:

z = (13,000 - 20,500)/3,750 = (-7,500)/3,750 = -2.0.

Yes, that's correct. For X=28,000:

(28,000 - 20,500)=7,500, so 7,500/3,750=2.0. Correct.

So the area between -2 and +2 is indeed about 0.9544.

Hmm, but wait, perhaps I'm missing something. The options include 385, which is 385. Maybe I should consider that the 381.76 rounds up to 382, but since the options don't have that, perhaps the answer is 385. Alternatively, maybe the question expects us to approximate 95% and then 400 * 0.95 = 380, which is close to 385. But 380 is not an option either. Wait, the options are A:100, B:200, C:390, D:300, E:400, F:385, G:375, H:395, I:350, J:50.

Wait, 381.76 is approximately 382, which is close to 385. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the question might have a typo, or perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, wait, perhaps I should double-check the z-scores again. Let me compute them again.

For X=13,000:

(13,000 - 20,500) = -7,500.

Divide by 3,750: -7,500 / 3,750 = -2.0. Correct.

For X=28,000:

(28,000 - 20,500) = 7,500.

7,500 / 3,750 = 2.0. Correct.

So, the z-scores are -2 and +2, and the area between them is about 0.9544, which is 95.44%.

So, 400 * 0.9544 = 381.76, which is approximately 382.

Looking at the options, the closest is F:385. But that's 385, which is 3.24 more than 381.76. Alternatively, perhaps the answer expects us to round up to the nearest 5, making it 385. Or maybe I'm missing something else.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the number of employees, and we can't have a fraction, so we round to the nearest whole number. 381.76 would round to 382. But since 382 isn't an option, perhaps the answer is 385, which is F. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the area.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I should use the precise values from the standard normal table. Let me think about the exact area between z=-2 and z=2.

Looking it up, the standard normal distribution table says that P(Z < 2) is 0.9772, and P(Z < -2) is 0.0228. So, the area between them is 0.9772 - 0.0228 = 0.9544, which is 95.44%, as I thought earlier.

So, 95.44% of 400 is 381.76, which is about 382.

But the options don't have 382. The closest option is F:385. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects us to round to the nearest 5, so 385 would be the answer.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the standard deviation or the mean. Let me check the numbers again.

Mean income is $20,500, standard deviation $3,750. So, 13k is 20,500 - 7,500, which is 2 SDs below, and 28k is 2 SDs above. So, the calculation seems correct.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the question is asking for the number of employees, and since we can't have a fraction, we round to the nearest whole number, which would be 382. But since 382 isn't an option, perhaps the correct answer is 385, which is option F.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the exact area might be slightly higher. Let me think, maybe I should use a calculator for more precision. Let me imagine using a calculator to find the area between z=-2 and z=2.

Using a calculator, the area from z=-2 to z=2 is approximately 0.954499, which is about 95.4499%. So, 0.954499 * 400 = ?

Let me compute that: 400 * 0.954499 = ?

Well, 400 * 0.95 = 380.

400 * 0.004499 = 400 * 0.004 = 1.6, and 400 * 0.000499 = 0.1996.

So, 1.6 + 0.1996 = 1.7996.

So total is 380 + 1.7996 = 381.7996, which is approximately 381.8.

Again, this rounds to 382, which isn't an option. So, perhaps the intended answer is 385, which is F.

Alternatively, maybe the question expects us to use the 68-95-99.7 rule, which says that about 95% are within two SDs. So, 400 * 0.95 = 380. But 380 isn't an option either. The closest option is F:385.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation earlier. Let me compute 400 * 0.9544 again.

0.9544 * 400:

Compute 400 * 0.9 = 360.

400 * 0.05 = 20.

400 * 0.0044 = 1.76.

Adding them together: 360 + 20 = 380, plus 1.76 is 381.76.

Yes, that's correct. So, 381.76 is approximately 382, which isn't an option. So, perhaps the intended answer is 385, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe I should check the options again.

Looking at the options, F is 385, which is 385. The next higher option is H:395, which is much higher. Alternatively, maybe the answer is 385, as it's the closest option above 381.76.

Alternatively, perhaps the question expects us to approximate 95% as 95.44%, and then 400 * 0.9544 = 381.76, which is approximately 382. Since 382 isn't an option, perhaps the answer is 385.

Wait, another thought: maybe I should consider that the z-scores are at -2 and +2, which actually correspond to 95.44% as I thought. But perhaps the options are rounded, and 381.76 is approximately 382, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is 385.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the z-scores. Let me check again.

Wait, is 13,000 really two SDs below? Let me compute the standard deviation again: 3,750. So, two SDs below the mean is 20,500 - 2*3,750 = 20,500 - 7,500 = 13,000. Correct.

And two SDs above is 20,500 + 7,500 = 28,000. Correct.

So, the z-scores are correct. Therefore, the area should be 0.9544.

So, 0.9544 * 400 = 381.76, which is about 382.

But since the options don't have that, perhaps the intended answer is F:385.

Alternatively, perhaps the question expects us to round to the nearest 5. 381.76 is approximately 380, but 380 isn't an option either. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is 385, which is option F.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the question is phrased as 'between $13,000 and $28,000', which includes both endpoints. So, using the continuity correction, perhaps we should adjust the z-scores slightly. But in this case, since the income values are exact multiples of the standard deviation, the continuity correction might not change much.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer expects us to use the approximate 95%, leading to 380, but since that's not an option, the next possible is 385.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is 385, which is F, because 381.76 is closer to 385 than to 380.

Wait, 381.76 is 381.76. The difference between 381.76 and 385 is 3.24, while the difference between 381.76 and 380 is 1.76. So, 380 is closer. But 380 isn't an option. The closest available option is F:385.

Alternatively, perhaps the intended answer is 385, so I'll go with F.
</think>

The problem involves calculating the expected number of employees with incomes between $13,000 and $28,000 in a normally distributed dataset. Using z-scores, the area between these values corresponds to approximately 95.44% of the distribution. Multiplying this probability by the total number of employees (400) yields approximately 381.76, which rounds to 382. Since 382 isn't an option, the closest available choice is F: 385.

Answer: F
