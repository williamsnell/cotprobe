Question:

Mr. Brennan owns an open field adjacent to his house. The coach of the local high school football team offered Mr. Brennan $250 to rent the field from him for his team's summer football drills. Mr. Brennan could also grow vege-tables on the field. The cost of seed, fertilizer, and hiring neighborhood teenagers to plant and harvest the field he estimates would be $200 and Mr. Brennan expects to receive $500 if he sold the vegetables. What are the explicit and implicit costs to Mr. Brennan of growing vege-tables, and will he choose to grow vegetables or rent the field?

Options:

A: Do nothing
B: Sell the field
C: Grow vegetables
D: Rent the field

Okay, so I have this economics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

Mr. Brennan has an open field next to his house. The local high school football coach wants to rent the field for summer drills and offered him $250. On the other hand, Mr. Brennan could use the field to grow vegetables. 

The costs involved in growing vegetables are seed, fertilizer, and hiring teenagers to plant and harvest. He estimates these costs to be $200. If he sells the vegetables, he expects to get $500. 

The question is about explicit and implicit costs and whether he should grow vegetables or rent the field.

First, I need to remember what explicit and implicit costs are. Explicit costs are the direct, out-of-pocket expenses, like money spent on seeds, fertilizer, and labor. Implicit costs are the opportunity costs, which are what you give up by choosing one option over another.

So, for growing vegetables, the explicit costs are $200. The implicit cost would be the next best alternative use of the field. In this case, the next best use is renting it to the football team for $250. So, the implicit cost is $250 because that's what he could earn by not choosing to grow vegetables.

Now, calculating the total cost of growing vegetables would be explicit plus implicit costs: $200 + $250 = $450. His revenue from selling vegetables is $500. So, his profit if he grows vegetables would be revenue minus total cost: $500 - $450 = $50 profit.

If he rents the field, he gets $250 with no further costs (since the question doesn't mention any other costs for renting). So, his profit in that case is $250.

Comparing both options: growing vegetables gives a profit of $50, while renting gives $250. So, from a purely financial standpoint, renting the field would be more profitable.

Wait, but maybe I'm missing something. Let me double-check. The problem says the coach offered $250 to rent the field. So if Mr. Brennan chooses to grow vegetables, he's forgoing that $250, which is his opportunity cost. So his total cost is $200 (explicit) + $250 (implicit) = $450. Revenue from vegetables is $500, so profit is $50. Renting gives $250 with no costs mentioned, so profit is $250.

Yes, that seems right. So he would make more money by renting the field than by growing vegetables. Therefore, he should choose to rent the field.

The explicit cost of growing vegetables is $200, while the implicit cost is the opportunity cost of not renting the field, which is $250. Total cost is $450, and revenue from selling vegetables is $500, resulting in a $50 profit. Renting the field yields a $250 profit with no costs. Mr. Brennan will choose to rent the field as it is more profitable.
