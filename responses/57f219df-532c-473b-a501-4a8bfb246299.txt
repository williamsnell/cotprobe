Okay, so I've got this question about why the sky is blue. Hmm, I remember learning something about this in school, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Let me think through it step by step.

The question gives me several options, A to J. I need to pick the correct reason. I think it has something to do with how sunlight interacts with the Earth's atmosphere. Wait, isn't it because of something called Rayleigh scattering? Yeah, that rings a bell. So, Rayleigh scattering explains why the sky appears blue during the day.

Let me go through each option one by one. 

Option A: "the Sun's rays pass through a blue layer of the atmosphere." Hmm, I don't think the atmosphere has a blue layer. The ozone layer is up high, but that's not blue. So A might not be right.

Option B: "the Sun mainly emits blue light." I know the Sun emits all colors, but I think it's more about how the light scatters, not that the Sun emits mostly blue. So B might not be correct.

Option C: "molecules scatter blue light more effectively than red light." This sounds familiar. I think blue light has a shorter wavelength, and shorter wavelengths are scattered more by the atmosphere's gases and particles. So C could be the right answer.

Option D: "the atmosphere absorbs mostly blue light." No, I think the atmosphere scatters blue light, not absorbs it. Plus, if it absorbed blue, the sky wouldn't appear blue. So D is probably wrong.

Option E: "molecules scatter red light more effectively than blue light." That would make the sky red, like during sunrise or sunset, but generally, the sky is blue. So E is incorrect.

Option F: "the Earth is mostly covered by water which reflects blue light." While water does reflect blue, the sky's blue is due to the atmosphere, not just the Earth's surface. So F isn't the main reason.

Option G: "the sky reflects the color of the ocean." Similar to F, this seems related to reflection, but the primary reason is the scattering of light by the atmosphere, not just reflection from the ocean.

Option H: "the ozone layer emits a blue glow." I don't think ozone emits light like that. Ozone absorbs UV light, but it doesn't emit blue to make the sky appear blue.

Option I: "clouds are actually blue, but appear white because of the Sun's brightness." Clouds do appear white because they reflect all colors, but that doesn't explain why the sky is blue when there are no clouds. So I isn't the right answer.

Option J: "blue is the color of space and we're seeing through the atmosphere." I'm not sure about this. Space is actually black, so this doesn't make sense. The atmosphere isn't blue; it's transparent, so we see the scattered light instead.

Putting it all together, the correct answer must be C: molecules scatter blue light more effectively than red light. That aligns with what I remember about Rayleigh scattering and how shorter wavelengths (blue) are scattered more by the atmosphere.

The sky appears blue because molecules in the atmosphere scatter shorter wavelengths of light, such as blue, more effectively than longer wavelengths like red. This phenomenon is known as Rayleigh scattering. 

Answer: C
