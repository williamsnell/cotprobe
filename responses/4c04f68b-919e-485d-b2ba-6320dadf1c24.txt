Question:

In the context of military security, which of the following is not an obvious benefit of adopting a 'critical' theoretical approach?

Options:

A: A more critical approach to military security studies will allow the inclusion or adoption of non-realist paradigms, such as social constructivism.
B: Critical analysis of military security will draw attention back to traditional conceptions of the state-centric paradigm which have been neglected in recent years, with states favouring human security and other non-traditional approaches instead.
C: By implementing a critical analysis we can recognise that traditional conceptions of military security are no longer always salient and may need to be reconsidered.
D: A critical approach would recognise the changing ontology of security in the real world. Such changes are evident in the new ways in which war has been conducted in the 20th and 21st century.

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about military security and critical theoretical approaches. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

The question is asking which option is NOT an obvious benefit of adopting a 'critical' theoretical approach in military security studies. The options are A through D, and I need to pick the one that isn't a benefit.

First, I should understand what a critical theoretical approach entails. From what I remember, critical theory often questions the status quo, examines underlying assumptions, and looks for power dynamics and inequalities. It's more about deconstructing existing paradigms rather than just accepting them.

Now, looking at each option:

Option A: It says a critical approach allows the inclusion of non-realist paradigms like social constructivism. That makes sense because critical theories often challenge realism. Realism in international relations, for example, focuses on state actors and power, while social constructivism looks at how norms and identities shape state behavior. So A seems like a benefit.

Option B: This one claims that critical analysis brings back attention to the state-centric paradigm, which has been neglected. Wait, isn't the state-centric approach what realism emphasizes? If critical theory is about moving beyond that, maybe this isn't a benefit. Or is it? Hmm. I'm a bit confused here. If states have moved towards human security and other non-traditional approaches, does critical analysis bring them back to state-centric ideas? I'm not sure if this is a benefit or a drawback.

Option C: It suggests that critical analysis makes us reconsider traditional military security concepts because they might not be as relevant anymore. That sounds like a benefit because critical approaches encourage reevaluation and adaptation to new realities.

Option D: This option states that a critical approach recognizes changes in security ontology, like how war has evolved in recent centuries. Definitely, critical theories would look at how the nature of war has changed (e.g., from state vs. state to non-state actors, cyber warfare, etc.), so this is a benefit.

So, reviewing the options, A, C, and D all seem to present clear benefits of a critical approach. That leaves B as the possible answer. If critical theory is about challenging the status quo and moving beyond traditional paradigms, then bringing back the state-centric approach might not be a benefit. In fact, it could be the opposite of what a critical approach aims for. Therefore, B is likely the correct answer because it's not a benefit but perhaps a limitation or a shift away from critical perspectives.

The question asks which option is not an obvious benefit of adopting a critical theoretical approach in military security studies. Critical theory often challenges traditional paradigms, examines underlying assumptions, and explores power dynamics. 

- **Option A**: Inclusion of non-realist paradigms like social constructivism is a benefit of critical approaches. 
- **Option B**: Bringing attention back to the state-centric paradigm, which has been neglected, is not a benefit because critical approaches typically move beyond traditional state-centric views.
- **Option C**: Recognizing the need to reconsider traditional military security concepts is a benefit.
- **Option D**: Acknowledging changes in the ontology of security, such as evolving forms of warfare, is also a benefit.

Thus, **Option B** is not an obvious benefit of a critical approach.

Answer: B
