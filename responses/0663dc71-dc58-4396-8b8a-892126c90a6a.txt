Okay, so I've got this problem here about calculating the heat capacity of a solution when sodium chloride dissolves in water. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

First, the problem says that at 20°C, the enthalpy change (ΔH) for dissolving one mole of NaCl in water to make a 12% solution is 774.6 cal. Then, at 25°C, the ΔH is 700.8 cal. I need to find the heat capacity of the solution in cal/degree-gram. The options are given from A to J.

Wait, so the heat capacity, Cp, is the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of the solution by one degree Celsius per gram. Right. So I think I'll need to find the total mass of the solution and then figure out how much heat is involved when the temperature changes from 20 to 25°C, which is a 5°C increase.

Wait, but wait. The enthalpy change is at two different temperatures. So maybe the change in enthalpy is due to the temperature change? Or perhaps the enthalpy change itself is affected by the temperature change.

Wait a second, the problem gives me two ΔH values at two different temperatures. So the first step is probably to find the change in enthalpy with temperature, and then use that to find the heat capacity.

Alternatively, perhaps the heat released or absorbed when dissolving NaCl is changing with temperature because the solution's heat capacity affects how the temperature changes.

Wait, let me think again. The problem is about the dissolution of NaCl in water. The enthalpy change (ΔH) is given at two temperatures: 20°C and 25°C. But I think the key here is that when the temperature changes, the enthalpy change of the solution itself (the dissolution process) might change because of the solution's heat capacity. So maybe the difference in ΔH between the two temperatures is due to the heat capacity of the solution.

Wait, so when the temperature increases by 5°C (from 20 to 25), the enthalpy change decreases from 774.6 cal to 700.8 cal. That's a difference of 774.6 - 700.8 = 73.8 cal. Hmm, so over a 5°C increase, the enthalpy change decreases by 73.8 cal.

But why does ΔH change with temperature? Oh right, because the solution's heat capacity comes into play. The solution absorbs or releases heat when the temperature changes, which affects the overall enthalpy change of the dissolution process.

Wait, but wait. The dissolution of NaCl is an exothermic process because the problem gives ΔH as a positive number? Or wait, no—wait, actually, I'm not sure if the ΔH is positive or negative. Wait, the question says "ΔH for the reaction of one mole of NaCl with sufficient water..." So I think ΔH is the enthalpy change for the dissolution. If it's positive, the process is endothermic; if negative, exothermic.

Wait, but wait, the problem gives two ΔH values: 774.6 cal at 20°C and 700.8 cal at 25°C. So as temperature increases, the ΔH decreases. Hmm, let me think. For an exothermic process, ΔH is negative. Wait, but wait, the actual value given is positive. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, in any case, the change in ΔH from 20°C to 25°C is 700.8 - 774.6 = -73.8 cal. So the ΔH decreases by 73.8 cal when the temperature increases by 5°C.

But why? Because when the solution's temperature changes, the solution's heat capacity affects how much the enthalpy changes. So the equation I think I need is:

ΔH2 = ΔH1 + (mass of solution) * (heat capacity of solution, Cp) * (ΔT)

Wait, but wait, I'm not sure about the sign. Let me think again. If the solution's temperature increases, the enthalpy of the solution increases as well because Cp is positive. So if the dissolution process at a higher temperature has a lower ΔH, perhaps because the solution's enthalpy has increased due to the temperature rise.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try writing the formula.

The change in enthalpy between the two temperatures would be due to the heat capacity of the solution. So the formula I think is:

ΔH1 = enthalpy at T1 (20°C)
ΔH2 = enthalpy at T2 (25°C)
ΔT = T2 - T1 = 5°C
ΔΔH = ΔH2 - ΔH1 = 700.8 - 774.6 = -73.8 cal

Now, the change in enthalpy (ΔΔH) is equal to the mass of the solution multiplied by its heat capacity (Cp) multiplied by the temperature change (ΔT). So:

ΔΔH = m * Cp * ΔT

But wait, I'm not sure if it's positive or negative. Let me think about the process. If the solution absorbs heat when the temperature increases, then the enthalpy of the solution increases. So the dissolution process's enthalpy change would decrease because the solution has absorbed some heat. So in this case, ΔH2 is less than ΔH1 because the solution has taken in heat, making the overall ΔH smaller.

Wait, so the change in enthalpy (ΔΔH) is negative because ΔH decreases. So, the equation would be:

ΔΔH = m * Cp * (T2 - T1)

Which is:

-73.8 cal = m * Cp * 5°C

So rearranged:

Cp = (ΔΔH) / (m * ΔT) )

Wait, but I don't know the mass of the solution. Wait, wait—no, wait. The problem says that the solution is 12% NaCl by weight. So for one mole of NaCl, how much water is there?

Wait, so let me think: when one mole of NaCl dissolves in water to make a 12% solution by weight, that means that the mass of NaCl is 12% of the total solution mass.

So, let me calculate the mass of NaCl and the mass of water.

Molar mass of NaCl: Na is about 23 g/mol, Cl is about 35.5 g/mol, so total is 58.5 g/mol.

So one mole of NaCl is 58.5 grams.

The solution is 12% NaCl by weight, so:

Let total mass of solution = m_total grams.

Mass of NaCl = 0.12 * m_total = 58.5 g.

So, 0.12 * m_total = 58.5 → m_total = 58.5 / 0.12 = 487.5 grams.

So the total mass of the solution is 487.5 grams.

Wait, that seems correct. Because in a 12% solution, 12% is NaCl, so 58.5 grams is 12% of the total solution mass, so total is 58.5 / 0.12 = 487.5 grams.

So the solution's mass is 487.5 grams.

Now, going back to the equation:

ΔΔH = m_total * Cp * ΔT

We have ΔΔH = -73.8 cal (since ΔH2 is less than ΔH1), m_total = 487.5 g, ΔT = 5°C.

So,

-73.8 = 487.5 * Cp * 5

Wait, but wait, let's check the signs. The ΔH decreases by 73.8 cal when temperature increases by 5°C. So the solution must have absorbed heat, so the enthalpy of the solution increases, which reduces the ΔH of the dissolution.

So the equation I think is correct with a negative sign.

But let's proceed with the calculation.

So,

Cp = (ΔΔH) / (m_total * ΔT) )

Cp = (-73.8 cal) / (487.5 g * 5°C) )

Calculating denominator: 487.5 *5 = 2437.5

So,

Cp = -73.8 / 2437.5 ≈ -0.0303 cal/°C-g.

Wait, that's a problem because heat capacity can't be negative. Hmm, maybe I messed up the sign in the equation.

Wait, perhaps the correct equation is:

ΔH1 = ΔH2 + m * Cp * ΔT

Because when temperature increases, the solution's enthalpy increases, so the dissolution's ΔH would decrease.

Wait, let me think in terms of heat absorbed by the solution. If the solution warms up, it absorbs heat from the dissolution. So the dissolution's enthalpy (ΔH) would be less because some heat is taken away by the solution warming up.

So, the correct equation would be:

ΔH1 = ΔH2 + m * Cp * ΔT

Because at T1 (20°C), the solution is at a lower temperature, so when the temperature increases to T2, the solution absorbs heat, which reduces the dissolution's enthalpy.

So,

774.6 = 700.8 + (487.5 g) * Cp * 5

So,

774.6 - 700.8 = 487.5 * Cp *5

73.8 = 487.5 *5 * Cp

73.8 = 2437.5 * Cp

So,

Cp = 73.8 / 2437.5 ≈ 0.0303 cal/°C-g.

Wait, but that's a very small number. None of the options are that low. The options are from about 0.58 to 1.48.

Hmm, that can't be right. I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, maybe I should consider the heat capacities of NaCl and water separately. Because the solution's heat capacity isn't just given; it's a combination of NaCl and water.

Oh wait, the problem gives Cp for solid NaCl as 12 cal/°C·mole and Cp for water as 18 cal/°C·mole.

Wait, but in the solution, the NaCl is dissolved, so it's in the solution as ions, right? So the heat capacity of the solution would be a combination of the heat capacities of the dissolved NaCl and the water.

Wait, so the solution's heat capacity is the sum of the contributions from NaCl and water.

So, for the solution, the total Cp = (mass of NaCl * Cp_NaCl) + (mass of water * Cp_water) ) / total mass.

Wait, but wait, I think the problem expects me to calculate the solution's heat capacity as (moles of NaCl * Cp_NaCl) + (moles of water * Cp_water).

Wait, because heat capacity is usually in cal/(°C·mol) for each component, and then you sum them up.

Hmm, but the problem asks for the solution's heat capacity in cal/(°C·g), so I need to compute it per gram of solution.

Wait, let me think again. The solution consists of NaCl and water. Each contributes to the total heat capacity.

So, first, find the moles of NaCl and moles of water.

We have one mole of NaCl, which is 58.5 g.

The solution is 12% NaCl by weight, so as calculated earlier, the total mass is 487.5 grams. So mass of water is 487.5 - 58.5 = 429 grams.

Molar mass of water is 18 g/mol, so moles of water = 429 / 18 ≈ 23.833 moles.

Now, the heat capacity contributions would be:

Cp_NaCl = 12 cal/(°C·mole) * 1 mole = 12 cal/°C.

Cp_water = 18 cal/(°C·mole) * 23.833 moles ≈ 429 cal/°C.

So total Cp_solution (in cal/°C) is 12 + 429 = 441 cal/°C.

But wait, that's per mole of NaCl. So the total heat capacity is 441 cal/°C for the solution when one mole of NaCl dissolves.

But the solution's mass is 487.5 grams, so the heat capacity per gram would be 441 cal/(°C) divided by 487.5 g.

So,

Cp = 441 / 487.5 ≈ 0.9047 cal/(°C·g).

Hmm, that's approximately 0.90 cal/(°C·g), which is close to option C (0.92) or E (0.87). But I'm not sure yet.

Wait, but wait a minute. I think I mixed up the approach. Because the problem is about the heat capacity of the solution, and the way the enthalpy changes with temperature.

Alternatively, maybe I should approach this using calorimetry. The dissolution releases or absorbs heat, and that heat is absorbed by the solution, causing its temperature to change.

Wait, but in this problem, the temperature changes from 20 to 25°C, which is a 5°C increase. The change in enthalpy between these two temperatures is because the solution's heat capacity affects how much the enthalpy of the solution changes.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to find the change in enthalpy due to the temperature change, which is the solution's heat capacity multiplied by the temperature change. And that would relate to the difference in ΔH between the two temperatures.

So, the difference in ΔH between 20°C and 25°C is 774.6 - 700.8 = 73.8 cal.

But wait, that's a positive value. So, when the temperature increases by 5°C, the ΔH decreases by 73.8 cal. So the solution must have absorbed 73.8 cal of heat when it warmed up from 20 to 25°C.

So, the heat absorbed by the solution is Q = m * Cp * ΔT = 73.8 cal.

We can solve for Cp: Cp = Q / (m * ΔT).

We have m = 487.5 g, ΔT = 5°C.

So,

Cp = 73.8 / (487.5 *5) = 73.8 / 2437.5 ≈ 0.0303 cal/(°C·g).

But that's way too small compared to the options given. So I must have made a wrong assumption here.

Wait, perhaps the enthalpy change itself is the heat absorbed by the solution. Let me think again.

Wait, so when the temperature increases by 5°C, the solution's enthalpy increases by m * Cp * ΔT. That would cause the ΔH of dissolution to decrease by that amount, because the solution has absorbed heat.

So, the change in ΔH (ΔΔH) is equal to - (m * Cp * ΔT).

Because the solution absorbing heat leads to a decrease in the dissolution's enthalpy.

So, ΔH at 25°C = ΔH at 20°C - (m * Cp * ΔT).

So,

700.8 = 774.6 - (487.5 * Cp *5)

Then,

700.8 -774.6 = -487.5 *5 * Cp

-73.8 = -2437.5 * Cp

So,

Cp = (-73.8)/(-2437.5) ≈ 0.0303 cal/(°C·g).

Again, same result, which is too low. So perhaps this approach isn't correct.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the enthalpy change of the solution with the heat capacity. Maybe I should approach it by considering the total heat change when the solution's temperature changes.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to calculate the solution's heat capacity based on the heat released or absorbed during dissolution and how the temperature changes.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should look at the possible options and see which makes sense.

Wait, earlier when I calculated the solution's heat capacity by adding the contributions from NaCl and water, I got approximately 0.90 cal/(°C·g). Looking at the options, option C is 0.92, which is close. But wait, let's recalculate that part more accurately.

So, the solution is 487.5 grams total, consisting of 58.5g NaCl and 429g water.

Moles of NaCl: 1 mole.

Moles of water: 429g / 18g/mol ≈ 23.8333 moles.

Cp for NaCl: 12 cal/(°C·mole) * 1 mole = 12 cal/°C.

Cp for water: 18 cal/(°C·mole) *23.8333 ≈ 429 cal/°C.

Total Cp = 12 + 429 = 441 cal/°C.

Now, the solution's mass is 487.5g, so Cp per gram is 441 / 487.5 ≈ 0.9047 cal/(°C·g).

Which is approximately 0.905, so option C is 0.92, which is close. But let me check the options again.

Options:

A: 1.10

B: 1.48

C: 0.92

D: 0.66

E: 0.87

F: 1.35

G: 0.75

H: 1.23

I: 1.01

J: 0.58

So 0.905 is closest to C (0.92) or E (0.87). Hmm. But perhaps I should consider that when NaCl dissolves, it dissociates into ions, which might have a different heat capacity than the solid NaCl. But the problem gives the Cp for solid NaCl as 12 cal/(°C·mole), so perhaps I should use that. Alternatively, maybe the dissolved ions have a different Cp, but the problem doesn't provide that, so I think I should go with the given data.

Wait, but wait a moment. The problem says "the reaction of one mole of NaCl with sufficient water to give a solution containing 12% NaCl by weight". So the solution is 12% NaCl, which we calculated as 487.5 grams total, with 58.5g NaCl and 429g water.

So when calculating the solution's heat capacity, it's the sum of the heat capacities of the NaCl and water in the solution.

But wait, the solution's heat capacity would also be affected by the presence of NaCl. Wait, but I'm not sure if the given Cp for NaCl is for the solid or the dissolved ions. Since the problem states "Cp of solid NaCl" is 12 cal/(°C·mole), perhaps when dissolved, it's different. But since the problem doesn't provide that, I'll proceed with solid NaCl's Cp, but that's probably incorrect because in solution, NaCl dissociates into ions, which have different heat capacities than the solid.

Hmm, this complicates things. Maybe I should proceed with the initial approach of using the change in ΔH to find Cp.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of calorimetry. The heat released or absorbed by the dissolution is related to the temperature change of the solution. So, when the dissolution occurs at 20°C, the solution's temperature might change, and similarly at 25°C. But the problem states that the ΔH is given at each temperature, so perhaps the temperature change is considered zero, which is not the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the difference in ΔH between the two temperatures is due to the solution's heat capacity. So, the heat released when dissolving at 25°C is less than at 20°C because the solution's temperature is higher, so it doesn't need to absorb as much heat.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck again. Let me try a different approach.

The problem gives the enthalpy changes at two temperatures and asks for the solution's heat capacity. So perhaps the change in ΔH is due to the solution's heat capacity over the temperature change.

So, the difference in ΔH between 20°C and 25°C is 774.6 - 700.8 = 73.8 cal. So, this 73.8 cal is the heat absorbed by the solution when the temperature increases by 5°C.

So,

Q = m * Cp * ΔT

73.8 cal = 487.5g * Cp *5°C

So,

Cp = 73.8 / (487.5 *5) = 73.8 / 2437.5 ≈ 0.0303 cal/(°C·g)

But that's 0.0303, which is way too small compared to the options. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the sign is wrong. Maybe the solution releases heat when the temperature increases, so the ΔH would be less. So the heat released by the solution is positive, leading to a negative ΔΔH.

Wait, but the calculation gives Cp as positive, which makes sense because heat capacity is always positive.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the absolute value.

So, 73.8 cal = 487.5g * Cp *5°C → Cp = 73.8 / (487.5 *5) ≈ 0.0303 cal/(°C·g). That's still too small.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I'm considering the entire solution's heat capacity, but the ΔH change is per mole of NaCl, so I should express Cp per mole of NaCl, not per gram of solution.

Wait, but the question asks for Cp in cal/(°C·g), so I need to find it per gram of solution.

Wait, maybe I'm missing a scaling factor. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the change in ΔH is due to the solution's heat capacity multiplied by the temperature change. So, the difference in ΔH is equal to the heat absorbed by the solution when the temperature increases from 20 to 25°C.

So,

ΔH1 (at 20°C) = 774.6 cal

ΔH2 (at 25°C) = 700.8 cal

ΔΔH = ΔH2 - ΔH1 = -73.8 cal

This means the solution absorbed 73.8 cal when the temperature increased by 5°C.

So,

Q = m * Cp * ΔT → 73.8 = 487.5 * Cp *5 → Cp = 73.8 / (487.5 *5) = 73.8 / 2437.5 ≈ 0.0303 cal/(°C·g)

But this is too low, so perhaps I'm missing something else. Maybe the problem expects me to consider the heat capacities of NaCl and water as part of the solution, as I did earlier, and get approximately 0.9 cal/(°C·g), which would be option C.

But then why is the ΔH changing with temperature? Maybe that part is a red herring, and the solution's heat capacity is simply calculated from the components.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the given data to find the solution's heat capacity, considering the change in ΔH with temperature.

Wait, another approach: The enthalpy change can be expressed as:

ΔH = nΔHfus + m_solution * Cp_solution * ΔT

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the enthalpy at a higher temperature is lower because the solution has a higher temperature and has absorbed heat.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

ΔH2 = ΔH1 + m_solution * Cp_solution * (T2 - T1)

Because when the solution warms up, its enthalpy increases, so the dissolution's ΔH decreases.

So,

700.8 = 774.6 + (487.5 g) * Cp * (5°C)

So,

700.8 - 774.6 = 487.5 * Cp *5 → -73.8 = 487.5 * Cp *5 → Cp = (-73.8)/(487.5 *5) → Cp ≈ -0.0303 cal/(°C·g)

But heat capacity can't be negative, so I must have the sign wrong. Let me reverse the equation.

Maybe ΔH2 = ΔH1 - m * Cp * ΔT.

So,

700.8 = 774.6 - (487.5)(Cp)(5)

So,

700.8 -774.6 = -487.5 *5 * Cp → -73.8 = -2437.5 * Cp → Cp = (-73.8)/(-2437.5) ≈ 0.0303 cal/(°C·g)

Again, same result. It's still too small. So perhaps this approach isn't correct.

Wait, maybe the problem is that the solution's heat capacity isn't just a simple average but involves the moles of each component. So, going back to the approach where I calculated Cp as (sum of component Cp contributions) / solution mass.

Earlier, I got approximately 0.90 cal/(°C·g). That's close to option C (0.92) and E (0.87). Let me check the exact calculation.

Cp_NaCl = 12 cal/(°C·mole) * 1 mole =12 cal/°C

Cp_water = 18 cal/(°C·mole) * (429g /18g/mol) =18 *23.833 ≈429 cal/°C

Total Cp =12 +429=441 cal/°C

Solution mass=487.5g

So Cp_solution=441 / 487.5=0.9047 cal/(°C·g)

Which is approximately 0.905, which is closest to option C: 0.92.

But wait, let me check the options again. Option C is 0.92, which is a bit higher than 0.905. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider significant figures. The given data has four significant figures, but the options are rounded. So 0.905 would round to 0.91, which isn't an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me recheck the moles of water.

Mass of water =487.5-58.5=429 grams.

Moles of water=429 /18=23.833333...

Cp_water=23.8333... *18=429 cal/°C.

Yes, that's correct.

Cp_NaCl=12 cal/°C.

Total Cp=441 cal/°C.

Solution mass=487.5g.

441/487.5=0.9047619...

So approximately 0.905 cal/(°C·g), which is about 0.905. The closest option is C:0.92.

But wait, 0.905 is closer to 0.91, which isn't an option. So perhaps the correct approach is to use the change in ΔH to find Cp.

Wait, but earlier that approach gave Cp=0.0303, which is way off. So perhaps the intended method is to calculate the solution's heat capacity from the components, leading to option C.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier approach by not considering the correct sign. Let me try that again.

If the solution's heat capacity is 0.90 cal/(°C·g), then when the temperature increases by 5°C, the heat absorbed by the solution would be 487.5g *0.90 *5 ≈ 219.375 cal.

But the change in ΔH is 774.6 -700.8=73.8 cal. So the solution's absorption of 219.375 cal would cause the ΔH to decrease by that much, but 219 is much larger than 73.8. So that can't be right.

Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved by considering the solution's heat capacity as a weighted average based on the mass percentages.

So, the solution is 12% NaCl and 88% water by weight.

Cp_solution = (0.12 * Cp_NaCl) + (0.88 * Cp_water)

But wait, Cp_NaCl is given as 12 cal/(°C·mole), and Cp_water is 18 cal/(°C·mole). But these are per mole, not per gram. So to find per gram, I need to adjust for molar masses.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the mass-based heat capacities.

Cp_NaCl (per gram) = 12 cal/(°C·mole) /58.5 g/mol ≈ 0.205 cal/(°C·g)

Cp_water (per gram) = 18 cal/(°C·mole)/18 g/mol =1 cal/(°C·g)

Then,

Cp_solution = 0.12 *0.205 + 0.88 *1 ≈0.0246 +0.88=0.9046 cal/(°C·g)

Which is the same as before, approximately 0.905, so option C:0.92.

But the options don't have 0.905, but option C is 0.92. Alternatively, perhaps rounding up, it's 0.905 → 0.91, but the closest option is C:0.92.

But wait, let me think again. The problem asks for the solution's heat capacity based on the data provided, including the change in ΔH with temperature. So perhaps I should combine both approaches.

Wait, perhaps the solution's heat capacity is found by the change in ΔH divided by the mass and temperature change. So,

Cp = (ΔΔH) / (m * ΔT) )

ΔΔH=73.8 cal (since ΔH decreases by 73.8 cal when temperature increases by 5°C). So,

Cp=73.8/(487.5 *5)=73.8/2437.5≈0.0303 cal/(°C·g)

But that's way too small, so perhaps this approach is wrong. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects me to use the solution's heat capacity from the components, which gives 0.905, which is option C:0.92.

Given that, I'll go with option C:0.92 cal/(°C·g).
</think>

To calculate the heat capacity of the solution, we first determine the total mass of the solution. The solution is 12% NaCl by weight, meaning 12% of the total mass is NaCl. For one mole of NaCl (58.5 g), the total solution mass is:

\[
\text{Total mass} = \frac{58.5 \, \text{g}}{0.12} = 487.5 \, \text{g}.
\]

The mass of water in the solution is:

\[
\text{Mass of water} = 487.5 \, \text{g} - 58.5 \, \text{g} = 429 \, \text{g}.
\]

Next, we calculate the moles of water:

\[
\text{Moles of water} = \frac{429 \, \text{g}}{18 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 23.833 \, \text{moles}.
\]

The heat capacities of NaCl and water are given as 12 cal/(°C·mole) and 18 cal/(°C·mole), respectively. The total heat capacity contribution of the solution is:

\[
C_p(\text{NaCl}) = 12 \, \text{cal/°C} \times 1 \, \text{mole} = 12 \, \text{cal/°C},
\]
\[
C_p(\text{water}) = 18 \, \text{cal/°C} \times 23.833 \, \text{moles} \approx 429 \, \text{cal/°C}.
\]

The total heat capacity of the solution is:

\[
C_p(\text{solution}) = C_p(\text{NaCl}) + C_p(\text{water}) = 12 \, \text{cal/°C} + 429 \, \text{cal/°C} = 441 \, \text{cal/°C}.
\]

To find the heat capacity per gram of the solution:

\[
C_p(\text{solution}) = \frac{441 \, \text{cal/°C}}{487.5 \, \text{g}} \approx 0.905 \, \text{cal/(°C·g)}.
\]

Among the given options, the closest value is **0.92 cal/(°C·g)**.
