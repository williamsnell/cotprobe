<think>
Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me write down what I understand and then work through it.

The problem says that iron(III) oxide reacts with carbon monoxide in a blast furnace to produce iron. The balanced chemical equation is given as Fe₂O₃ + 3CO → 2Fe + 3CO₂. I'm asked to find the volume of CO at STP needed to completely react with 31.94 kg of Fe₂O₃. The molecular weights (MW) provided are Fe₂O₃ = 159.7 g/mol and CO = 28 g/mol. The options are from A to J, and I need to choose the correct one.

First, I think I need to find out how many moles of Fe₂O₃ are in 31.94 kg. Since the molecular weight is 159.7 g/mol, I can convert kilograms to grams for easier calculation. 

31.94 kg is the same as 31,940 grams. To find the moles, I divide the mass by the molecular weight. So, 31,940 g ÷ 159.7 g/mol. Let me do that division. Hmm, 159.7 times 200 is about 31,940, so that would make it approximately 200 moles of Fe₂O₃. Wait, let me check that: 159.7 × 200 = 31,940. Yep, that's right. So, moles of Fe₂O₃ = 200 mol.

Next, I need to look at the balanced equation to find the mole ratio between Fe₂O₃ and CO. The equation is Fe₂O₃ + 3CO → products. So, 1 mole of Fe₂O₃ reacts with 3 moles of CO. That means for every mole of Fe₂O₃, we need 3 moles of CO. 

Since I have 200 moles of Fe₂O₃, the moles of CO required would be 200 × 3 = 600 moles of CO.

Now, I need to convert moles of CO into volume at STP. I remember that at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP), 1 mole of any gas occupies 22.4 liters. So, the volume of CO needed would be 600 moles × 22.4 L/mol. Let me calculate that: 600 × 22.4 is 13,440 liters. Wait, wait a second—that's a huge volume. Let me double-check my calculations because 600 moles seems a lot, and 13,440 L is 13.44 m³, which seems way too big for a 31.94 kg sample. Maybe I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, no, wait another thing. Oh, I think I messed up the initial step. Let me go back. The given mass is 31.94 kg, which is 31,940 grams. The molecular weight of Fe₂O₃ is 159.7 g/mol. So the moles are 31,940 / 159.7. Let me recalculate that.

159.7 × 200 = 31,940, so 200 moles of Fe₂O₃. That's correct. Then, the mole ratio is 3 moles CO per 1 mole Fe₂O₃, so 200 × 3 = 600 moles CO.

Ah, but wait, the options given are much smaller. The highest option is J: 22.4 L, which is 1 mole, but I'm getting 600 moles, which would be 600 × 22.4 = 13,440 L, but that's not an option. The options are all in a few tens of liters. So I must have made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the conversion from kg to grams. Let me check again: 31.94 kg is 31,940 grams, right? Yes. 31,940 divided by 159.7. Let me do that division more accurately.

Let me compute 31,940 ÷ 159.7. Let me see: 159.7 × 200 = 31,940. Because 159.7 × 200 is 31,940. So yes, 200 moles.

Hmm, but the options don't go beyond 22.4 L. So maybe I made a mistake in the stoichiometry. Let me check the balanced equation again. The equation is Fe₂O₃ + 3CO → 2Fe + 3CO₂. So yes, 3 moles of CO per mole of Fe₂O₃. So 200 moles Fe₂O₃ × 3 = 600 moles CO.

But the options don't have anything near 13,440 L. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Oh wait, no, the options are in liters, but I must have made a mistake in the calculations. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe I confused moles. Let me try the calculation again. 31,940 grams divided by 159.7 g/mol. Let me compute it precisely.

Calculate 31,940 / 159.7.

Let me compute 159.7 × 200 = 31,940. So yes, exactly 200 moles. So that's correct.

Then, moles of CO is 3 × 200 = 600 moles.

Volume of CO at STP is 600 × 22.4 L = 13,440 L.

But looking at the options, the highest option is J: 22.4 L, which is way lower. So I must have made a mistake. Wait, maybe the problem was phrased differently. Let me reread the problem.

Wait, the problem states that Fe₂O₃ reacts with CO to produce Fe and CO₂. The balanced equation is Fe₂O₃ + 3CO → 2Fe + 3CO₂. So the mole ratio is correct.

Wait, perhaps the mass given is in kg, but I'm treating it correctly by converting to grams. 31.94 kg is 31,940 grams. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the mole ratio. Let me make sure. The balanced equation is Fe₂O₃ + 3CO → 2Fe + 3CO₂. So 1 mole Fe₂O₃ reacts with 3 moles CO. So 200 moles Fe₂O₃ would require 600 moles CO. That seems right.

Wait, but perhaps I'm supposed to find the volume of CO, but maybe I'm miscalculating the liters. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to find the volume of CO₂, but the question is about CO. No, the question is about CO.

Wait, looking at the options again, the options are A:20, B:17.6, C:11.2, D:13.44, E:10, F:25.2, G:8.96, H:15, I:18.72, J:22.4.

Wait, 600 × 22.4 is 13,440 liters. But that's way beyond any of the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation of moles.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the moles of Fe₂O₃. Let me double-check: 31,940 g ÷ 159.7 g/mol.

Let me compute 159.7 × 200 = 31,940. So yes, 200 moles. So that's correct.

Wait, is there a mistake in the stoichiometry? Let me check again. Fe₂O₃ + 3CO → 2Fe + 3CO₂. So 3 moles CO per 1 mole Fe₂O₃.

So 200 × 3 = 600 moles CO.

Volume = 600 × 22.4 L = 13,440 L. But none of the options match that. So I'm confused. Maybe I messed up the problem.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I'm supposed to use different molar masses. Let me check the given molar masses again. Fe₂O₃ is 159.7 g/mol and CO is 28 g/mol.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the mass of CO needed and then convert to volume, but that seems more complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to use the molar volume at STP differently.

Wait, let me think again. At STP, 1 mole = 22.4 L. So 600 moles would be 600 × 22.4 = 13,440 L. But the options don't have this. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I misread the problem. Let me read it again.

The question says: What volume of CO at STP is required to completely use up 31.94 kg of iron oxide?

So, the given mass is 31.94 kg, and I converted correctly to grams. Moles of Fe₂O₃: 200, moles of CO: 600, volume 600 × 22.4 = 13,440 L. But the options don't have that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the mole ratio. Let me check the balanced equation again.

Fe₂O₃ + 3CO → 2Fe + 3CO₂.

Yes, 1 Fe₂O₃ reacts with 3 CO. So, 3 moles CO per mole Fe₂O₃. So 200 moles Fe₂O₃ → 600 moles CO.

Hmm, but the options don't have that. So perhaps the problem is that I'm supposed to find the volume of CO₂ instead of CO, but no, the question is about CO.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to find the volume of CO at STP, but perhaps the calculation is different. Let me think.

Wait, maybe I'm supposed to calculate the moles of Fe₂O₃, then find moles of CO, then convert to volume. Let me go through the steps again.

1. Mass of Fe₂O₃: 31.94 kg = 31,940 g.

2. Moles Fe₂O₃ = 31,940 g ÷ 159.7 g/mol = 200 mol.

3. From the balanced equation, 1 mol Fe₂O₃ reacts with 3 mol CO. So moles CO needed = 200 × 3 = 600 mol.

4. Volume of CO at STP = 600 mol × 22.4 L/mol = 13,440 L.

But the options don't go anywhere near that. The highest option is J:22.4 L, which is 1 mole. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation of moles.

Wait, wait a second. Let me recalculate the moles of Fe₂O₃.

31,940 grams ÷ 159.7 g/mol.

Let me compute this division step by step.

159.7 × 200 = 31,940. So exactly 200 moles. That's correct.

Hmm, but then the CO is 600 moles. So volume is 13,440 L, which is not an option. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in the problem setup.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the reaction is as written: Fe₂O₃ + 3CO → 2Fe + 3CO₂. But perhaps I'm supposed to consider that CO is a product, but no, in the reaction, CO is a reactant.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that I'm using the wrong stoichiometric coefficients. Let me check the balanced equation again.

Fe₂O₃ + 3CO → 2Fe + 3CO₂.

Yes, 3 moles of CO per mole of Fe₂O₃.

Wait, perhaps the balanced equation is Fe₂O₃ + 3CO → 2Fe + 3CO₂, which is correct.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is that I should have used the molar mass of CO as 28 g/mol, which I did.

Wait, perhaps I'm supposed to find the volume of CO₂ instead, but the question is about CO, so that's not it.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the problem statement. Let me read it again:

The balanced reaction is: Fe₂O₃ + 3CO → 2Fe + 3CO₂.

The question is: What volume of CO at STP is required to completely use up 31.94 kg of iron oxide?

So, the problem is correct. So, I'm getting 600 moles of CO, which is 13,440 L. But that's not an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial step.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the molar mass of Fe₂O₃ is 160 g/mol, but the given is 159.7, which is approximately 160. So, maybe I should use 160 g/mol.

Let me recalculate the moles using 160 g/mol.

31,940 g ÷ 160 g/mol = 199.625 mol. Approximately 200 mol. So that doesn't change much.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I should find the volume of CO in the products, but no, the question is about CO as a reactant.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup. Let me think differently.

Wait, perhaps I should find the moles of Fe₂O₃, then find how many moles of CO are needed, then convert to volume. But I'm getting 13,440 L, which isn't an option. So maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the reaction is written with Fe₂O₃ as Fe3O4 or something else. No, the problem states Fe₂O₃.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I should use the molar mass of Fe₂O₃ as 160 g/mol instead of 159.7, but that's negligible.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the volume is at STP, which is 22.4 L per mole, but perhaps I need to adjust for temperature or pressure, but the problem states STP, so that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the reaction actually produces CO₂, but the question is about CO, so perhaps I should find the volume of CO consumed, which is what I did.

Wait, perhaps I should check the options again. Let me list them:

A:20.000 l

B:17.600 l

C:11.200 l

D:13.440 l

E:10.000 l

F:25.200 l

G:8.960 l

H:15.000 l

I:18.720 l

J:22.400 l

Wait, option D is 13.440 L. Hmm, 13.44 L is 0.6 × 22.4 L. Wait, but 600 moles would be 600 ×22.4 =13,440 L. But 13.44 L is 600 ÷ 100, which is 6 moles. So that's way off.

Wait a minute, perhaps I made a mistake in the stoichiometry. Let me check the balanced equation again. Fe₂O₃ + 3CO → 2Fe + 3CO₂.

Wait, so 1 mole Fe₂O₃ reacts with 3 moles CO. So for 200 moles Fe₂O₃, 600 moles CO. So volume is 600 ×22.4 = 13,440 L. But that's not an option. So perhaps the problem is that I'm supposed to use a different stoichiometric ratio.

Wait, perhaps the balanced equation is different. Let me think: Fe₂O₃ + 3CO → 2Fe + 3CO₂. That's correct. So the ratio is 3 CO to 1 Fe₂O₃.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is that the question is about the volume of CO₂ produced, but no, the question is about CO used.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I'm supposed to find the volume of CO₂, but that's not the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the molar mass calculation. Let me check:

Fe₂O₃: Fe is about 55.85 g/mol, O is 16. So 2×55.85 = 111.7; 3×16=48; total 159.7 g/mol. Correct.

CO: 12 (C) +16 (O) =28 g/mol. Correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I'm supposed to find the volume of CO at STP needed, but considering that CO is a gas and perhaps I should account for something else. No, at STP, 1 mole is 22.4 L.

Wait, I'm stuck. My calculation leads to 13,440 L, but that's not an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial step.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I should not have used 31,940 grams. Let me check: 31.94 kg is 31,940 grams. Correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I should have used the molar mass of Fe₂O₃ as 159.7 g/mol, which I did: 31,940 ÷159.7=200.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the question is from a source where the options are incorrect, or perhaps I made a mistake in the stoichiometry.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the balanced equation is different. Let me think: Maybe it's Fe₂O₃ + 3CO → 2Fe + 3CO₂. That's correct. So 3 moles CO per mole Fe₂O₃.

Wait, perhaps I should look for an option that is 13.44 L, which is option D:13.440 L. But 13.44 L is 0.6 moles (since 0.6 ×22.4=13.44). But I have 600 moles, which would be 13,440 L. So perhaps I made a mistake in the stoichiometry by a factor of 100. Wait, perhaps I confused kg with g. Wait, no, I converted kg to grams correctly.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the mass given is 31.94 g, not kg. Let me check the problem again. It says 31.94 kg. So no, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of moles. Let me compute 31,940 ÷159.7 precisely.

Let me compute 159.7 × 200 = 31,940. So 200 moles. Correct.

So I'm confident that I have 200 moles Fe₂O₃, which requires 600 moles CO, which is 13,440 L. But that's not an option. So perhaps the problem is that I have a typo in the balanced equation. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the balanced equation is Fe₂O₃ + 3CO → 2Fe + 3CO₂. So 3 moles CO per mole Fe₂O₃.

Alternatively, perhaps the balanced equation is different. Let me check once more.

Fe₂O₃ + 3CO → 2Fe + 3CO₂. Yes, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I have to consider that CO is diatomic, but that's already accounted for in the molar mass. CO is 28 g/mol, correct.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for an alternative approach. Perhaps I'll calculate the moles of Fe₂O₃, then find the moles of CO needed, then find the volume.

Moles Fe₂O₃ = 31,940 g /159.7 g/mol = 200 mol.

Moles CO needed = 3 ×200 =600 mol.

Volume CO =600 ×22.4 L=13,440 L.

But options don't have this, so perhaps the problem is that I have a typo in the reaction. Let me think: perhaps the reaction is Fe₂O₃ + CO → 2Fe + CO₂. Let me balance that.

Fe₂O₃ + CO → 2Fe + CO₂.

Balancing:

Fe:2 on each side.

O:3 on left, 2 on right (from CO₂). So to balance O, perhaps multiply CO by 3.

Wait, Fe₂O₃ + 3CO → 2Fe + 3CO₂. That's the correct balanced equation.

So I'm back to the same stoichiometry. So I'm confident that 600 moles of CO are needed, leading to 13,440 L.

But since that's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup. Wait, perhaps the problem is that the reaction produces Fe and CO₂, and I'm supposed to find the volume of CO used, but perhaps I should find the moles of Fe produced and then relate it back.

Wait, the problem is about using up Fe₂O₃, so perhaps that's not necessary.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that I'm supposed to find the volume of CO used per kilogram of Fe₂O₃, and then multiply by 31.94 kg. But that's what I did earlier.

Wait, perhaps I should check the options again. Let me see:

Option D is 13.440 L, which is 600 mol × 0.0224 L/mol, but that's not correct.

Wait, 22.4 L is 1 mole, so 13.44 L would be 0.6 moles. That's way off from 600 moles.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the stoichiometry by a factor of 100. Let me think: 200 moles ×3=600, but perhaps I should have divided by 100 somewhere. But I don't see where.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I should have used the molar mass of Fe as 55.85 g/mol, but that's not relevant here.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the reaction is per mole of Fe, but no, the balanced equation is per Fe₂O₃.

I'm really stuck here. I think my calculation is correct, but the answer isn't among the options. Maybe I should look for a different approach.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the moles of Fe₂O₃, then find the moles of CO, then find the volume. Let me write that:

Moles Fe₂O₃ = 31940 g /159.7 g/mol =200 mol.

Moles CO needed =3 ×200=600 mol.

Volume CO=600 ×22.4 L=13,440 L.

But no option matches. So perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but since I have to choose from the options, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I should have used the molar mass of Fe₂O₃ as 160 g/mol, which would make moles =31940/160=199.625, approximately 200. So same result.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that I should have used the molar mass of CO as 28 g/mol, which I did.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the reaction is written as Fe₂O₃ + CO → 2Fe + CO₂, but in that case, the stoichiometric ratio would be 1 CO per Fe₂O₃, and the moles of CO would be 200, leading to 200 ×22.4=4,480 L, which is also not an option.

Wait, perhaps I should try the reaction with different coefficients. Let me think: perhaps the balanced equation is Fe₂O₃ + 3CO → 2Fe + 3CO₂, which is correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the stoichiometry by a factor of 10. Let me see: 31.94 kg is 31,940 g. 31,940 ÷159.7=200. So 200 moles Fe₂O₃. 3×200=600 moles CO. 600×22.4=13,440 L.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct answer isn't listed, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I should have used the molar mass of Fe₂O₃ as 159.7 g/mol correctly. Let me compute 31,940 ÷159.7 precisely.

31,940 ÷159.7 = ?

Let me compute 159.7 ×200=31,940. So exactly 200 moles. Correct.

Hmm, I'm stuck. I think the correct answer is 13,440 L, but that's not an option. Therefore, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the reaction is Fe₂O₃ + 3CO → 2Fe + 3CO₂, but I should consider that CO is a gas and CO₂ is a gas, but that doesn't affect the stoichiometry.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that I should have used the molar mass of Fe₂O₃ as 160 g/mol, leading to 31,940 ÷160=199.625 mol, approximately 200 mol. So same result.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the question is about the volume of CO₂ produced, but that's not the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the volume of CO used per mole of Fe₂O₃ and then multiply by the moles.

Volume per mole Fe₂O₃ =3 ×22.4=67.2 L.

Total volume for 200 moles Fe₂O₃=200 ×67.2=13,440 L.

Again, same result.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I should have used the molar mass of Fe₂O₃ as 159.7 g/mol, but the calculation is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that I should have used the molar mass of CO as 28 g/mol, which I did.

Wait, perhaps I should check the options again. Option D is 13.440 L, which is 13.44 L. That's 0.6 moles. So perhaps I made a mistake in the stoichiometry by a factor of 1000.

Wait, 31.94 kg is 31,940 g. 31,940 ÷159.7=200. So moles CO=600. 600 ×22.4=13,440 L. Not matching.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the reaction is written as Fe₂O₃ + CO → 2Fe + CO₂, which would require 1 mole CO per mole Fe₂O₃. So 200 moles CO, 200 ×22.4=4,480 L. Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is Fe₂O₃ + 3CO → 2Fe + 3CO₂, which is correct. So I think my calculation is correct, but the answer isn't among the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial step.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the problem is asking for the volume of CO in liters, but perhaps I should have converted from moles to volume differently. No, at STP, 1 mole =22.4 L.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the molar gas constant is different, but I think 22.4 L/mol is correct at STP.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I should have used the molar mass of Fe₂O₃ as 160 g/mol, leading to 31940/160=199.625 mol, which is approximately 200 mol. So same result.

I think I've tried all possible angles. My conclusion is that the correct answer should be 13,440 L, but that's not an option. Therefore, perhaps the problem has a typo, or I made a mistake somewhere. But given the options, perhaps I should look for an option that is 13.44 L, which is option D. But 13.44 L is way too small for 600 moles. So I'm confused.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the stoichiometry. Let me think again: the balanced equation is Fe₂O₃ + 3CO → 2Fe + 3CO₂.

So, 1 mole Fe₂O₃ → 3 moles CO.

So, moles CO = 3 × moles Fe₂O₃.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the mass of CO needed and then convert to volume. Let me try that.

Molar mass of CO is 28 g/mol.

Moles CO =600 mol.

Mass CO =600 ×28=16,800 g=16.8 kg.

But the problem doesn't ask for mass, it asks for volume.

So, volume CO=600 ×22.4=13,440 L.

But again, not an option.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem statement. Let me read it again.

The problem says: What volume of CO at STP is required to completely use up 31.94 kg of iron oxide?

So, I think I have to go with my calculation, but the answer isn't among the options. Therefore, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I should have used the molar mass of Fe₂O₃ as 159.7 g/mol, but the calculation is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that I should have used the molar mass of CO as 28 g/mol correctly.

Wait, perhaps I should check the options again. Option D is 13.440 L, which is 13.44 L. That's 0.6 moles. So perhaps I made a mistake by a factor of 1000. Let me see: 600 ÷1000=0.6. So perhaps I should have used 0.3 instead of 3 in the stoichiometry. But why would that be?

Wait, perhaps the balanced equation is Fe₂O₃ + CO → 2Fe + CO₂, which would require 1 mole CO per mole Fe₂O₃. So 200 moles CO, leading to 4,480 L, which is still not an option.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the reaction is Fe₂O₃ + 3CO → 2Fe + 3CO₂, but I'm supposed to find the volume of CO used per mole of Fe₂O₃, which is 3 ×22.4=67.2 L per mole Fe₂O₃. So for 200 moles, 200 ×67.2=13,440 L.

Again, same result.

I think I've tried everything. My conclusion is that the correct answer is 13,440 L, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is D:13.440 L, but that would be incorrect based on the calculations. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup, but I can't figure it out.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I should have used the molar mass of Fe₂O₃ as 159.7 g/mol, leading to 200 moles, and then the moles of CO as 3 ×200=600, and then the volume as 600 ×22.4=13,440 L. But since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is D:13.440 L, but that would require 600 moles to be 0.6 moles, which is a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem intended to use 31.94 g instead of kg, which would make it 31.94 g. Let me try that.

31.94 g ÷159.7 g/mol=0.2 mol Fe₂O₃.

Moles CO=3×0.2=0.6 mol.

Volume CO=0.6 ×22.4=13.44 L. That would be option D:13.440 L.

Ah! So perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the mass as kg instead of grams. The problem says 31.94 kg, but perhaps it's a typo and should be grams. Alternatively, perhaps I should have treated it as grams.

If the mass is 31.94 g, then:

Moles Fe₂O₃=31.94 g ÷159.7 g/mol ≈0.2 mol.

Moles CO=0.6 mol.

Volume=0.6 ×22.4=13.44 L, which is option D.

So perhaps the correct answer is D:13.440 L.

To determine the volume of CO required to react with 31.94 kg of Fe₂O₃ at STP, the following steps are taken:

1. **Convert the mass of Fe₂O₃ to moles**:  
   The molar mass of Fe₂O₃ is 159.7 g/mol.  
   \[
   \text{Moles of Fe₂O₃} = \frac{31,940 \, \text{g}}{159.7 \, \text{g/mol}} = 200 \, \text{mol}.
   \]

2. **Determine the moles of CO required**:  
   From the balanced chemical equation \( \text{Fe₂O₃} + 3\text{CO} \rightarrow 2\text{Fe} + 3\text{CO₂} \), 1 mole of Fe₂O₃ reacts with 3 moles of CO.  
   \[
   \text{Moles of CO} = 3 \times 200 \, \text{mol} = 600 \, \text{mol}.
   \]

3. **Convert moles of CO to volume at STP**:  
   At STP, 1 mole of gas occupies 22.4 L.  
   \[
   \text{Volume of CO} = 600 \, \text{mol} \times 22.4 \, \text{L/mol} = 13,440 \, \text{L}.
   \]

4. **Reconcile with the given options**:  
   The calculated volume (13,440 L) does not match any of the provided options. Upon re-evaluating the problem, it is noted that the mass of Fe₂O₃ was initially interpreted as 31.94 kg (31,940 g). However, if the mass is actually 31.94 g, the calculation changes:  
   \[
   \text{Moles of Fe₂O₃} = \frac{31.94 \, \text{g}}{159.7 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.2 \, \text{mol}.
   \]  
   \[
   \text{Moles of CO} = 3 \times 0.2 \, \text{mol} = 0.6 \, \text{mol}.
   \]  
   \[
   \text{Volume of CO} = 0.6 \, \text{mol} \times 22.4 \, \text{L/mol} = 13.44 \, \text{L}.
   \]

This matches option **D: 13.440 L**, suggesting the intended mass was likely 31.94 g, not kg.

**Answer: D**
