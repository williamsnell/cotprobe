Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here about a heat pump. I'm a bit rusty on heat pumps, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The question says the COP (coefficient of performance) is given by COP = -q1/w = T1/(T2 - T1) = 7.0. So COP is 7. I need to find the ratio q2/w, where q2 is the heat liberated at the higher temperature T2, and w is the work done.

Hmm, I remember that for heat pumps, COP is defined as the heat delivered to the hot reservoir divided by the work input. So COP = q2/w. Wait, but in the question, it's written as COP = -q1/w. Oh, maybe because q1 is the heat absorbed from the cold reservoir, which is negative when considering heat delivered to the hot side. Or maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, let's clarify. In heat pumps, the COP is usually the heat delivered to the hot reservoir divided by the work input. So COP = q2/w. But sometimes, the COP is defined as the heat removed from the cold reservoir divided by the work, but that's for refrigerators. Wait, no, for heat pumps, I think it's q2 over w, because you're delivering heat to the hot side.

Wait, but the given COP is expressed as -q1/w. So q1 is the heat taken from the cold reservoir. So maybe in this formula, q1 is negative because it's heat entering the system. Wait, but COP is usually a positive quantity. Let me think.

Wait, maybe the formula is written as COP = q2/w, but in some formulations, it's expressed as COP = -q1/w because q1 is the heat absorbed from the cold source. So in that case, q1 is negative, so the negative makes it positive. So COP = |q1|/w = T1/(T2 - T1) =7.

So, the given COP is 7. Now, the question asks for q2/w. Wait, but if COP is q2/w, then that would be 7. So why is the question asking for q2/w then? Or maybe I'm mixing up the terms.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the first law of thermodynamics. For a heat pump, the work done w equals the heat delivered to the hot reservoir minus the heat taken from the cold reservoir. So w = q2 - q1. But in terms of signs, it depends on the convention. Let me get that right.

Alternatively, for a heat pump, the first law is: w = q2 - q1, where q2 is the heat delivered to the hot side, and q1 is the heat absorbed from the cold side. Since the system is taking in heat q1 and putting out q2, and doing work w.

Alternatively, maybe the formula is better approached using the COP expression given. The COP is given as T1/(T2 - T1) =7. So let's write that equation: T1/(T2 - T1) =7.

I can solve for T2 in terms of T1. Let's let T1 be a variable, say x, so x/(T2 -x) =7. Then x =7(T2 -x). Expanding that: x =7 T2 -7x. Bringing terms together: x +7x =7 T2 → 8x =7 T2 → T2 = (8x)/7.

Hmm, but I'm not sure if I need the actual temperatures. The question is about finding q2/w. Wait, from the COP definition, COP is q2/w, so if COP is 7, then q2/w would be 7. But wait, the question gives COP as -q1/w, which equals 7. So COP = -q1/w =7 → q1= -7w.

Wait, but I thought COP is q2/w. So if COP is 7, then q2 =7w. So then q2/w is 7. So option I is 7.0, which is the same as the COP given. So why is the question asking for q2/w again? Because maybe I'm misunderstanding the variables.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the definition wrong. Let me double-check. For a heat pump, COP is defined as the heat delivered to the hot reservoir (q2) divided by the work input (w). So COP = q2/w. So if COP is 7, then q2/w is 7. So the answer would be I:7.0.

But let me think again. The given COP in the problem is written as COP = -q1/w =7. So that implies that COP = q2/w =7. So yes, q2/w is 7. So the answer is I:7.0.

Wait, but another approach: perhaps using the formula for a heat pump's COP in terms of temperatures. The formula is COP = T1/(T2 - T1). So with COP=7, T1/(T2-T1)=7. Let's solve for T2 in terms of T1.

T1 =7(T2 - T1) → T1=7 T2 -7 T1 → T1 +7 T1=7 T2 →8 T1=7 T2 → T2= (8/7) T1.

Now, I need to find q2/w. Wait, but as per the COP definition, COP = q2/w. So if COP is 7, then q2/w=7. So the answer is 7.0, which is option I.

Alternatively, perhaps I should find q2 in terms of q1. From the first law, w= q2 - q1. Since COP = q2/w =7, then q2=7w. Substituting into w= q2 - q1: w=7w - q1 → q1=7w -w=6w → q1=6w.

Wait, but from the problem statement, COP is also given as -q1/w =7. So -q1/w=7 → q1= -7w. But earlier I found q1=6w. That seems conflicting. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, let's clarify the signs. In the formula COP = -q1/w, q1 is the heat absorbed from the cold source, so it's entering the system, which might be negative if we're considering the heat leaving the system. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is written as COP= q2/w = T1/(T2-T1). So perhaps the initial approach is correct, and the answer is 7.0.

Wait, but maybe I should think differently. Let's consider that for a heat pump, the heat expelled to the hot reservoir (q2) is the sum of the work done (w) and the heat absorbed from the cold reservoir (q1). So q2 = w + q1. So COP = q2/w = (w + q1)/w = 1 + q1/w.

But from the problem, COP is given as -q1/w =7 → q1/w= -7 → q1= -7w. Substituting into COP: COP=1 + (-7) = -6. That can't be right because COP should be positive. Hmm, maybe I got the signs wrong.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is COP= q2/w = T1/(T2-T1). So with COP=7, then as before, T2= (8/7) T1.

Now, from the first law, the work done w is equal to q2 - q1. But since q1 is the heat absorbed from the cold source, which is negative in the sign convention where heat entering the system is negative, perhaps. Alternatively, maybe I should write w = q2 - q1, where q1 is positive (heat entering from cold), and q2 is positive (heat expelled to hot). So then w = q2 - q1.

From COP = q2/w → q2=7w. So substituting into w=7w - q1 → q1=7w -w=6w. So q1=6w.

Wait, but the problem states that COP= -q1/w=7 → (-q1)/w=7 → q1= -7w. But according to this, q1=6w. So that's a contradiction. So perhaps I messed up the signs somewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that q1 is the heat extracted from the cold reservoir, so it's negative in the system's perspective. So in that case, q1 is negative. So the COP would be expressed as -q1/w =7. So q1= -7w.

Then, from the first law, w = q2 - q1. Substituting q1= -7w, we get w = q2 - (-7w) → w = q2 +7w → q2= w -7w → q2= -6w.

Wait, that can't be right because q2 should be positive as heat delivered to the hot reservoir. So maybe I'm getting the signs wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to use the formula for COP in terms of temperatures and find q2/w from that.

We know COP= T1/(T2 - T1)=7. So T2-T1= T1/7 → T2= T1 + T1/7= (8/7) T1.

Now, the heat expelled to the hot reservoir (q2) is given by the formula: q2= w * COP.

So q2=7w. Therefore, the ratio q2/w is 7. So the answer is I:7.0.

Wait, but earlier I got confused with the signs. Maybe it's better to stick to the formula. Since the question gives COP as 7, and we're to find q2/w, which is the same as COP, so it's 7.0.
</think>

The coefficient of performance (COP) for a heat pump is defined as the ratio of the heat delivered to the hot reservoir (\(q_2\)) to the work input (\(w\)), i.e., \( \text{COP} = \frac{q_2}{w} \). The problem states that \( \text{COP} = 7.0 \), which directly implies \( \frac{q_2}{w} = 7.0 \). Therefore, the ratio of the heat liberated at the higher temperature \(T_2\) to the work done is 7.0.
