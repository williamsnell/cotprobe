Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem says there's an electric field, E, with an average magnitude of about 150 N/C pointing downward near Earth's surface. We want to float a sulfur sphere that weighs 4.4 N by charging it. The question is asking what charge we need, including the sign and magnitude.

Hmm, right. So, I remember that when an object is charged, it experiences a force in an electric field. The formula for that force is F = qE, where F is the force, q is the charge, and E is the electric field. Since the sphere is being made to float, the electric force must balance the gravitational force. That makes sense because if the forces are equal and opposite, the net force is zero, so the sphere doesn't moveâ€”it floats.

So, the gravitational force on the sphere is its weight, which is given as 4.4 N downward. The electric force needs to be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction to counteract that. Since the electric field is pointing downward, the direction of the electric force depends on the charge's sign.

Wait, let me think. The electric field direction is the direction a positive charge would move. So, if the field is downward, a positive charge would feel a force downward. But we want an upward force to counteract gravity. So, the charge must be negative. Because a negative charge would feel a force opposite to the field direction. Oh right, so the force from the electric field on a negative charge would be upward, which is what we need.

So, F_electric = q * E. But since the electric field is downward, I should consider the direction. Alternatively, maybe I can just set up the forces as vectors. The gravitational force is F_gravity = mg downward, and the electric force is F_electric = qE upward. For equilibrium, F_electric must equal F_gravity in magnitude.

So, mathematically, that would be q * E = mg. Wait, but here, the electric field E is given as 150 N/C downward. So, the direction might affect the sign. Let me think in terms of signs. Let me take downward as positive for E, but then F_gravity is downward (positive), and F_electric needs to be upward (negative). So, perhaps F_electric = q * E. But E is downward, so E is positive. So, F_electric = q * E. Since we need F_electric upward (negative), q must be negative because E is positive.

Wait, maybe it's easier to just take magnitudes since the problem doesn't specify directions beyond the field being downward. So, the magnitude of F_electric should equal the weight. So, |q| * E = mg.

Wait, no, because F_electric = qE. The direction depends on the charge. Since we need the electric force upward, which is opposite to E (which is downward), the charge must be negative. So, the formula becomes q * E = -mg. Because the electric force is upward, which I'll take as positive, but the gravitational force is downward (negative). Wait, maybe I should better structure this with signs.

Let me set up a coordinate system where upward is positive. Then, the gravitational force F_gravity = -mg (since it's downward). The electric force F_electric = qE (E is 150 N/C downward, so in this coordinate system, E is negative because it's pointing downward). So, E = -150 N/C.

Wait, that's a good point. The electric field E is a vector, so in this coordinate system, E is -150 N/C. So, F_electric = q * E = q*(-150) N/C.

For equilibrium, F_electric + F_gravity = 0. So, F_electric = - F_gravity. Because F_gravity is downward (-4.4 N), F_electric must be +4.4 N (upward).

So, F_electric = q * E = 4.4 N.

But E is -150 N/C, so:

q*(-150) = 4.4

So, solving for q:

q = 4.4 / (-150) = -0.02933... C.

Hmm, that's approximately -0.029 C. Looking at the options, option J is -0.029 C. So that's the charge needed.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation. 4.4 divided by 150 is 0.02933..., so with the negative sign, it's -0.029 C. Yep, that matches option J.

Alternatively, if I approach it by taking magnitudes, the equation is |q| * E = mg. So, |q| = mg / E = 4.4 N / 150 N/C = 0.02933 C. And since the charge must be negative (as reasoned before), the answer is -0.029 C.

To determine the charge required to float the sulfur sphere, we balance the gravitational force with the electric force. The gravitational force is the weight of the sphere, \( F_{\text{gravity}} = 4.4 \, \mathrm{N} \) downward. The electric force is given by \( F_{\text{electric}} = q \vec{E} \), where \( \vec{E} = -150 \, \mathrm{N/C} \) (downward). For equilibrium, the forces must cancel: \( F_{\text{electric}} = -F_{\text{gravity}} \).

Substituting into the equation:
\[
q \cdot (-150) = 4.4
\]
Solving for \( q \):
\[
q = \frac{4.4}{-150} \approx -0.02933 \, \mathrm{C}
\]
Rounding to two decimal places, \( q \approx -0.029 \, \mathrm{C} \). The negative sign indicates the charge must be negative to produce an upward electric force, balancing the downward gravitational force.
