Answer:
    <think>
<think>
Okay, so I have this initial value problem to solve. The differential equation is y' + (1/4)y = 3 + 2 cos(2t), and the initial condition is y(0) = 0. I need to find the first value of t where y(t) equals 12. The answer choices are given, so I can check against those once I find t.

First, I remember that this is a linear first-order differential equation. The standard approach is to find the integrating factor and then solve for y(t). Let me try to recall the steps.

The general form is y' + P(t)y = Q(t). Here, P(t) is 1/4, which is a constant. So the integrating factor, μ(t), is e^(∫P(t) dt) = e^(∫(1/4) dt) = e^(t/4). 

Next, I multiply both sides of the DE by the integrating factor:

e^(t/4) y' + (1/4)e^(t/4) y = e^(t/4) [3 + 2 cos(2t)].

The left side should be the derivative of (e^(t/4) y). So, integrating both sides with respect to t:

∫ d/dt (e^(t/4) y) dt = ∫ e^(t/4) [3 + 2 cos(2t)] dt.

So, e^(t/4) y = ∫ [3 e^(t/4) + 2 e^(t/4) cos(2t)] dt + C.

Now, I need to compute the integral on the right. Let's split it into two parts:

Integral of 3 e^(t/4) dt + Integral of 2 e^(t/4) cos(2t) dt.

The first integral is straightforward. Integral of 3 e^(t/4) dt is 3*(4) e^(t/4) + C = 12 e^(t/4) + C.

The second integral is more complicated: Integral of 2 e^(t/4) cos(2t) dt. I think I can use integration by parts for this, or perhaps a table of integrals. Alternatively, I remember that the integral of e^(at) cos(bt) dt can be found using a standard formula.

The formula is ∫ e^(at) cos(bt) dt = [e^(at) (a cos(bt) + b sin(bt))] / (a² + b²) + C.

In my case, a = 1/4 and b = 2. So applying the formula:

Integral of e^(t/4) cos(2t) dt = [e^(t/4) ((1/4) cos(2t) + 2 sin(2t))] / ( (1/4)^2 + (2)^2 ) + C.

Let me compute the denominator: (1/16) + 4 = (1 + 64)/16 = 65/16.

So the integral becomes:

[e^(t/4) ( (1/4) cos(2t) + 2 sin(2t) ) ] / (65/16) ) + C.

Simplify that:

(16/65) e^(t/4) [ (1/4) cos(2t) + 2 sin(2t) ] + C.

Multiply by 2 because the original integral was 2 times that:

2 * (16/65) e^(t/4) [ (1/4 cos(2t) + 2 sin(2t) ) ] + C.

So, 32/65 e^(t/4) [ (1/4 cos(2t) + 2 sin(2t) ) ] + C.

Wait, I think I made a mistake here. Let me check again.

Wait, the integral of e^(t/4) cos(2t) is [e^(t/4) ( (1/4) cos(2t) + 2 sin(2t) ) ] / ( (1/4)^2 + 2^2 ).

Which is [e^(t/4) ( (1/4) cos(2t) + 2 sin(2t) ) ] / (1/16 + 4) = [e^(t/4) ( (1/4) cos(2t) + 2 sin(2t) ) ] / (65/16).

So that is 16/65 e^(t/4) [ (1/4 cos(2t) + 2 sin(2t) ) ].

Then, multiplying by 2 (since the integral is 2 times that):

2 * [16/65 e^(t/4) (1/4 cos(2t) + 2 sin(2t)))] = (32/65) e^(t/4) [ (1/4 cos(2t) + 2 sin(2t)) ) ].

Hmm, perhaps simplifying this expression further would help.

Let me compute the coefficients:

32/65 * (1/4) = 8/65, and 32/65 * 2 = 64/65.

So the integral becomes:

(32/65) e^(t/4) [ (1/4 cos(2t) + 2 sin(2t) ) ] = (8/65) e^(t/4) cos(2t) + (64/65) e^(t/4) sin(2t).

Wait, perhaps it's better to leave it as (32/65) e^(t/4) [ (1/4 cos(2t) + 2 sin(2t) ) ] for now.

Putting it all together, the integral of the entire right-hand side is:

12 e^(t/4) + (32/65) e^(t/4) [ (1/4 cos(2t) + 2 sin(2t) ) ] + C.

So, e^(t/4) y = 12 e^(t/4) + (32/65) e^(t/4) [ (1/4 cos(2t) + 2 sin(2t) ) ] + C.

Now, divide both sides by e^(t/4) to solve for y:

y = 12 + (32/65)[ (1/4 cos(2t) + 2 sin(2t) ) ] + C e^(-t/4).

Simplify the terms:

First, 32/65 * 1/4 = 8/65, and 32/65 * 2 = 64/65.

So y = 12 + (8/65) cos(2t) + (64/65) sin(2t) + C e^(-t/4).

Now apply the initial condition y(0)=0. Let's substitute t=0 into the equation:

0 = 12 + (8/65) cos(0) + (64/65) sin(0) + C e^(0).

cos(0) is 1, sin(0) is 0, and e^0 is 1. So:

0 = 12 + 8/65 *1 + 0 + C.

Compute 8/65: 8 divided by 65 is approximately 0.123076923.

So 12 + 0.123076923 = 12.123076923.

Then, 0 = 12.123076923 + C => C = -12.123076923.

But let's keep it exact. 8/65 is 8/65, so 12 + 8/65 = (12*65 +8)/65 = (780 +8)/65 = 788/65.

So, 788 ÷ 65 is exactly 12.123076923.

So, C = -788/65.

Therefore, the solution is:

y(t) = 12 + (8/65) cos(2t) + (64/65) sin(2t) - (788/65) e^(-t/4).

Now, the problem is to find the first t where y(t) = 12.

So set y(t) = 12:

12 = 12 + (8/65) cos(2t) + (64/65) sin(2t) - (788/65) e^(-t/4).

Subtract 12 from both sides:

0 = (8/65) cos(2t) + (64/65) sin(2t) - (788/65) e^(-t/4).

Multiply both sides by 65 to eliminate denominators:

0 = 8 cos(2t) + 64 sin(2t) - 788 e^(-t/4).

Rearranging:

8 cos(2t) + 64 sin(2t) = 788 e^(-t/4).

Hmm, this looks a bit complicated. Let me see if I can simplify the left side.

The left side is a linear combination of sin and cos, which can be written as a single sinusoid. The general form is A cosθ + B sinθ = C cos(θ - φ), where C = sqrt(A² + B²) and tanφ = B/A.

Let me compute that.

A = 8, B = 64.

So, C = sqrt(8² + 64²) = sqrt(64 + 4096) = sqrt(4160).

sqrt(4160) can be simplified: 4160 = 16 * 260 = 16 * 4 * 65 = 64 * 65. So sqrt(4160) = 8 sqrt(65).

So, 8 cos(2t) + 64 sin(2t) = 8 sqrt(65) cos(2t - φ), where φ = arctan(64/8) = arctan(8). Because tanφ = B/A = 64/8 = 8.

So, the equation becomes:

8 sqrt(65) cos(2t - φ) = 788 e^(-t/4).

Hmm, perhaps it's better to write it as:

cos(2t - φ) = (788 / (8 sqrt(65))) e^(-t/4).

Compute 788 / (8 sqrt(65)):

First, 788 ÷ 8 = 98.5.

sqrt(65) is approximately 8.062257748.

So 98.5 / 8.062257748 ≈ 12.218.

So, cos(2t - φ) ≈ 12.218 e^(-t/4).

Wait, but the maximum value of the cosine function is 1, so 12.218 e^(-t/4) must be less than or equal to 1. Because otherwise, the equation would have no solution.

Wait, but 12.218 e^(-t/4) must be ≤ 1. Let's see when that happens.

12.218 e^(-t/4) ≤ 1 => e^(-t/4) ≤ 1/12.218 ≈ 0.08185.

Taking natural logs: -t/4 ≤ ln(0.08185) ≈ -2.502.

Multiply both sides by -4 (which reverses the inequality):

t ≥ 10.008.

So, t must be greater than approximately 10.008 for 12.218 e^(-t/4) ≤ 1.

But wait, looking at the answer choices, option I is 9.012345, which is less than 10, so perhaps my approximation is off? Or maybe I made a mistake in calculations.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Wait, let me compute 788/(8 sqrt(65)).

First, sqrt(65) is exactly sqrt(65), so 8 sqrt(65) is 8 * 8.062257748 ≈ 64.49806198.

So 788 / 64.49806198 ≈ 12.218.

So, cos(2t - φ) = 12.218 e^(-t/4).

But as the cosine function can't exceed 1, we require 12.218 e^(-t/4) ≤ 1.

So, e^(-t/4) ≤ 1/12.218 ≈ 0.08185.

Taking the natural logarithm on both sides:

-t/4 ≥ ln(0.08185) ≈ -2.502.

So, t/4 ≤ 2.502 => t ≤ 10.008.

Wait, that's the opposite of what I thought before. Because, if e^(-t/4) is less than 0.08185, then -t/4 < ln(0.08185) ≈ -2.502. So, -t/4 < -2.502 => t/4 > 2.502 => t > 10.008.

Wait, that makes sense. So when t > 10.008, the term 12.218 e^(-t/4) becomes less than 1, which is necessary for the equation to have a solution.

So, the solution for t must be greater than approximately 10.008.

Looking at the options, options I is 9.012345, which is less than 10, so that's too early. Option B is 10.065778, which is just above 10.008, so that's a possible candidate.

Wait, but perhaps I should solve it more accurately. Alternatively, maybe I can approach this numerically.

Another approach: since the equation is 8 cos(2t) + 64 sin(2t) = 788 e^(-t/4).

I can write the left side as 8 cos(2t) + 64 sin(2t). Let's compute this as a single sinusoidal function.

As before, 8 cos(2t) + 64 sin(2t) = R cos(2t - φ), where R = sqrt(8^2 + 64^2) = sqrt(64 + 4096) = sqrt(4160) = 8 sqrt(65).

And φ is such that tan φ = 64/8 = 8, so φ = arctan(8). Let me compute φ.

arctan(8) is approximately 1.4464 radians, since tan(1.4464) ≈ 8.

So, the equation becomes:

8 sqrt(65) cos(2t - 1.4464) = 788 e^(-t/4).

Dividing both sides by 8 sqrt(65):

cos(2t - 1.4464) = (788 / (8 sqrt(65))) e^(-t/4).

Compute 788/(8 sqrt(65)):

sqrt(65) ≈ 8.062257748.

8 * 8.062257748 ≈ 64.49806198.

So, 788 / 64.49806198 ≈ 12.218.

So, cos(2t - 1.4464) ≈ 12.218 e^(-t/4).

As before, since cos(...) can't be more than 1, 12.218 e^(-t/4) must be ≤ 1.

So, e^(-t/4) ≤ 1/12.218 ≈ 0.08185.

Which gives t ≥ 10.008, as before.

But how precise can I be? Let me see.

Let me define a function f(t) = 8 cos(2t) + 64 sin(2t) - 788 e^(-t/4).

I need to find t where f(t) = 0, and the first such t after t=10.008.

Let me try t=10.065778 (option B).

Compute f(10.065778):

First, compute 2t = 20.131556 radians.

But 20.131556 radians is more than 3π (≈9.42477796) and less than 4π (≈12.56637061). Wait, but 20.131556 is actually more than 6π (≈18.84955592), so 20.131556 - 6π ≈ 20.131556 - 18.84955592 ≈ 1.28200008 radians. So, cos(20.131556) = cos(1.28200008) ≈ 0.296.

Similarly, sin(20.131556) = sin(1.28200008) ≈ 0.955.

So, 8 cos(20.131556) ≈ 8 * 0.296 ≈ 2.368.

64 sin(20.131556) ≈ 64 * 0.955 ≈ 61.12.

So, 8 cos(2t) + 64 sin(2t) ≈ 2.368 + 61.12 ≈ 63.488.

Now, 788 e^(-10.065778/4) = 788 e^(-2.5164445).

Compute e^(-2.5164445): e^2 ≈ 7.389, e^2.5 ≈ 12.182, e^2.5164445 ≈ e^(2.5 + 0.0164445) ≈ 12.182 * e^(0.0164445) ≈ 12.182 * 1.01657 ≈ 12.182 * 1.01657 ≈ approx 12.38. So, e^(-2.5164445) ≈ 1/12.38 ≈ 0.08076.

So, 788 * 0.08076 ≈ 788 * 0.08 = 63.04, plus 788 * 0.00076 ≈ 0.600. So approximately 63.64.

So, f(t) ≈ 63.488 - 63.64 ≈ -0.152. So f(t) is negative at t=10.065778.

Hmm, that's close to zero. Let me check a slightly higher t, say t=10.1.

Compute 2t=20.2 radians.

20.2 radians is 20.2 - 6π ≈ 20.2 - 18.84955592 ≈ 1.35044408 radians.

cos(1.35044408) ≈ 0.217, sin(1.35044408) ≈ 0.976.

So, 8 cos(2t) ≈ 8 * 0.217 ≈ 1.736.

64 sin(2t) ≈ 64 * 0.976 ≈ 62.544.

Sum: 1.736 + 62.544 ≈ 64.28.

Compute 788 e^(-10.1/4) = 788 e^(-2.525).

e^(-2.525): Since e^2.525 ≈ e^2.5 * e^0.025 ≈ 12.182 * 1.0253 ≈ 12.50, so e^(-2.525) ≈ 1/12.5 ≈ 0.08.

So, 788 * 0.08 ≈ 63.04.

So, f(t)=64.28 -63.04 ≈ 1.24, which is positive.

So, between t=10.065778 (f≈-0.152) and t=10.1 (f≈1.24), the function crosses zero. So the root is between 10.065778 and 10.1.

Looking at the options, option B is 10.065778, and option I is 9.012345, which we've already determined is too low, and option E is 9.876543, which is also too low. So the correct answer must be around 10.065778.

Wait, but in my calculation at t=10.065778, f(t)=-0.152, and at t=10.1, f(t)=1.24. So using linear approximation, the zero crossing is somewhere between those two points.

Let me use the linear approximation. The change in t is 10.1 -10.065778 ≈ 0.034222. The change in f(t) is 1.24 - (-0.152) = 1.392.

We need to find the t where f(t)=0. Starting at t=10.065778, f(t)=-0.152. We can set up the linear approximation:

f(t) ≈ f(a) + (t - a) * (f(b) - f(a))/(b -a).

So, to find t where f(t)=0:

t ≈ a - f(a) * (b - a)/(f(b) - f(a)).

Here, a=10.065778, f(a)=-0.152; b=10.1, f(b)=1.24.

So, t ≈ 10.065778 - (-0.152)*(10.1 -10.065778)/(1.24 - (-0.152)).

Compute denominator: 1.24 + 0.152 = 1.392.

Compute numerator: (10.1 -10.065778) = 0.034222.

So, t ≈ 10.065778 + (0.152 * 0.034222)/1.392.

Compute 0.152 *0.034222 ≈ 0.005196.

Divide by 1.392: ≈0.005196/1.392 ≈ 0.00373.

So, t≈10.065778 +0.00373≈10.0695.

So, approximately 10.0695, which is close to option B (10.065778), but a little higher. Hmm, but perhaps my approximation is rough.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use a numerical method like Newton-Raphson to find the root more accurately.

But given that the options are given, and the closest option above 10.065778 is B, which is 10.065778, but our estimate is around 10.0695, which isn't among the options. Wait, looking again at the options, option B is 10.065778, and option H is 8.945321, which is too low, so the next higher option after B is D:7.654321, which is also lower. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should check my initial calculations again. Maybe I made a mistake in the integrating factor or the integration.

Wait, let me recheck the solution steps.

The DE is y' + (1/4) y = 3 + 2 cos(2t).

The integrating factor is e^{∫1/4 dt} = e^{t/4}.

Multiplying both sides:

e^{t/4} y' + (1/4) e^{t/4} y = e^{t/4} (3 + 2 cos(2t)).

Left side is d/dt (e^{t/4} y).

Integrate both sides:

e^{t/4} y = ∫ e^{t/4} (3 + 2 cos(2t)) dt + C.

Split into two integrals:

Integral of 3 e^{t/4} dt + Integral of 2 e^{t/4} cos(2t) dt.

First integral: 3 * 4 e^{t/4} =12 e^{t/4}.

Second integral: Use integration formula.

Let me recompute the integral of e^{at} cos(bt) dt.

The formula is correct: [e^{at} (a cos(bt) + b sin(bt))]/(a² + b²).

So, for a=1/4, b=2:

Integral e^{t/4} cos(2t) dt = e^{t/4} [ (1/4) cos(2t) + 2 sin(2t) ] / ( (1/4)^2 + (2)^2 ).

Denominator: (1/16) + 4 = (1 + 64)/16 = 65/16.

So the integral is (16/65) e^{t/4} [ (1/4 cos(2t) + 2 sin(2t) ) ].

Multiply by 2:

2 * (16/65) e^{t/4} [ (1/4 cos(2t) + 2 sin(2t) ) ] = (32/65) e^{t/4} [ (1/4 cos(2t) + 2 sin(2t) ) ].

So, the integral becomes:

12 e^{t/4} + (32/65) e^{t/4} [ (1/4 cos(2t) + 2 sin(2t) ) ] + C.

Divide by e^{t/4}:

y =12 + (32/65)[ (1/4 cos(2t) + 2 sin(2t) ) ] + C e^{-t/4}.

Simplify:

(32/65)(1/4) = 8/65, (32/65)*2 =64/65.

So, y=12 + (8/65 cos(2t) + 64/65 sin(2t)) + C e^{-t/4}.

Applying y(0)=0:

0 =12 + (8/65 *1 + 0) + C.

So, C= -12 -8/65 = -(12*65 +8)/65 = -(780 +8)/65 = -788/65.

So, y(t) = 12 + (8/65 cos(2t) + 64/65 sin(2t)) - (788/65) e^{-t/4}.

Now, set y(t)=12:

12 =12 + (8/65 cos(2t) + 64/65 sin(2t)) - (788/65) e^{-t/4}.

Subtract 12:

0= (8/65 cos(2t) + 64/65 sin(2t)) - (788/65) e^{-t/4}.

Multiply by 65:

0=8 cos(2t)+64 sin(2t) -788 e^{-t/4}.

So, 8 cos(2t)+64 sin(2t)=788 e^{-t/4}.

As before.

Now, perhaps I can write the left side as R cos(2t - φ) where R=sqrt(8^2 +64^2)=sqrt(4160)=8 sqrt(65).

So, 8 cos(2t) +64 sin(2t)=8 sqrt(65) cos(2t - φ), where φ=arctan(64/8)=arctan(8).

So, 8 sqrt(65) cos(2t - φ)=788 e^{-t/4}.

Divide both sides by 8 sqrt(65):

cos(2t - φ)= (788)/(8 sqrt(65)) e^{-t/4}.

Compute (788)/(8 sqrt(65)):

sqrt(65)≈8.062257748.

8*8.062257748≈64.49806198.

788/64.49806198≈12.218.

So, cos(2t - φ)=12.218 e^{-t/4}.

But cos(θ) ≤1, so 12.218 e^{-t/4} ≤1.

So, e^{-t/4} ≤1/12.218≈0.08185.

Take natural log:

-t/4 ≤ ln(0.08185)≈-2.502.

Multiply both sides by -4 (remember to flip inequality):

t ≥10.008.

So, the first solution occurs around t≈10.008.

Looking at the options, the closest higher value is option B:10.065778.

But when I checked t=10.065778, f(t)≈-0.152, which is just below zero, so the actual root is a bit higher than 10.065778. But the next option after B is E:9.876543, which is lower than 10.008, so it can't be. The only higher option is I:9.012345, which is lower than 10.008, so it's not possible.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the phase angle calculation. Let me check again.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that when t is such that 2t - φ= some angle where cos is positive and the equation holds. Alternatively, perhaps using a numerical approach would be better.

Alternatively, perhaps using a graphing approach. Let me try to compute f(t) at t=10.065778 and t=10.0695.

At t=10.065778:

Compute 2t=20.131556 radians.

20.131556 radians is equal to 20.131556 - 6π ≈20.131556 -18.84955592≈1.28200008 radians.

cos(1.28200008)=approx 0.296, sin=0.955.

So, 8 cos(2t)=8*0.296≈2.368.

64 sin(2t)=64*0.955≈61.12.

Sum≈63.488.

Now, 788 e^{-t/4}=788 e^{-10.065778/4}=788 e^{-2.5164445}.

Compute e^{-2.5164445}=1/(e^{2.5164445}).

e^{2}=7.38905609893, e^{2.5164445}=e^{2} * e^{0.5164445}.

Compute e^{0.5164445}:

We know that ln(1.675)= approx 0.516, since e^{0.5}=1.6487, e^{0.5164445}≈1.675.

So, e^{2.5164445}=7.389056 *1.675≈7.389056 *1.6=11.8225, plus 7.389056*0.075≈0.554179, total≈12.3767.

Thus, e^{-2.5164445}=1/12.3767≈0.0808.

So, 788 *0.0808≈788*0.08=63.04, plus 788*0.0008=0.6304, so total≈63.6704.

Thus, f(t)=8 cos(2t)+64 sin(2t)-788 e^{-t/4}≈63.488 -63.6704≈-0.1824.

Wait, that's more negative than my previous estimate. Hmm.

Now, at t=10.065778, f(t)≈-0.1824.

At t=10.07:

Compute 2t=20.14 radians.

20.14 -6π≈20.14-18.84955592≈1.29044408.

cos(1.29044408)≈0.295, sin≈0.955.

So, 8 cos(2t)=2.36, 64 sin(2t)=61.12, sum≈63.48.

Compute e^{-t/4}=e^{-10.07/4}=e^{-2.5175}.

e^{2.5175}=e^{2} * e^{0.5175}.

e^{0.5175}=approx 1.677 (since ln(1.677)=0.5175).

So, e^{2.5175}=7.389 *1.677≈7.389*1.6=11.8224, plus 7.389*0.077≈0.568, total≈12.3904.

Thus, e^{-2.5175}=1/12.3904≈0.0807.

So, 788*0.0807≈63.67.

f(t)=63.48 -63.67≈-0.19.

Wait, that's getting more negative, which can't be right. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, maybe I should compute 2t=20.131556 radians. Let me compute cos(20.131556) and sin(20.131556) more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps using a calculator would help, but since I'm doing this manually, let me try another approach.

Alternatively, maybe I can write the equation as:

y(t) = 12 + (8/65) cos(2t) + (64/65) sin(2t) - (788/65) e^{-t/4}.

We set y(t)=12, so:

(8/65) cos(2t) + (64/65) sin(2t) = (788/65) e^{-t/4}.

Multiply both sides by 65:

8 cos(2t) + 64 sin(2t) =788 e^{-t/4}.

Let me define f(t) =8 cos(2t) +64 sin(2t) -788 e^{-t/4}.

We need to find t where f(t)=0.

We can try using the Newton-Raphson method to find the root.

First, let's compute f(t) at t=10.065778:

Compute 2t=20.131556 radians.

Compute cos(20.131556):

20.131556 radians is 20.131556 - 6π ≈20.131556 -18.84955592≈1.28200008 radians.

cos(1.28200008)= approx 0.296.

Similarly, sin(1.28200008)= approx 0.955.

So, 8 cos(2t)=8*0.296≈2.368.

64 sin(2t)=64*0.955≈61.12.

Sum: 2.368 +61.12≈63.488.

Compute 788 e^{-10.065778/4}=788 e^{-2.5164445}.

As before, e^{-2.5164445}≈0.0808.

So, 788 *0.0808≈63.67.

Thus, f(t)=63.488 -63.67≈-0.182.

Now, compute f'(t) at t=10.065778:

f'(t)= -16 sin(2t) +128 cos(2t) + (788/4) e^{-t/4}.

Compute each term:

-16 sin(2t) at t=10.065778: 2t=20.131556, sin(20.131556)=sin(1.28200008)=approx 0.955.

So, -16*0.955≈-15.28.

128 cos(2t)=128*0.296≈37.888.

(788/4) e^{-t/4}=197 e^{-2.5164445}≈197*0.0808≈15.9176.

So, f'(t)= -15.28 +37.888 +15.9176≈38.5256.

Now, Newton-Raphson update:

t1 = t0 - f(t0)/f'(t0).

t0=10.065778, f(t0)=-0.182, f'(t0)=38.5256.

So, t1=10.065778 - (-0.182)/38.5256≈10.065778 +0.004725≈10.070503.

Compute f(t1)=f(10.070503):

2t≈20.141006 radians.

20.141006-6π≈20.141006-18.84955592≈1.29145008 radians.

cos(1.29145008)= approx 0.295, sin≈0.955.

8 cos(2t)=8*0.295≈2.36.

64 sin(2t)=64*0.955≈61.12.

Sum≈63.48.

788 e^{-10.070503/4}=788 e^{-2.51762575}.

Compute e^{-2.51762575}≈1/12.38≈0.08076.

788*0.08076≈63.64.

So, f(t1)=63.48 -63.64≈-0.16.

Wait, but that's not correct because with t=10.070503, I'd expect f(t) to be closer to zero. Perhaps my approximations are too rough. Alternatively, perhaps using more accurate values for cos and sin.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use a calculator for more precise values.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B:10.065778, given that it's the first option above the estimated t=10.008, and the function crosses zero near there.

Wait, but from my earlier calculation, at t=10.065778, f(t)=-0.182, and at t=10.1, f(t)=1.24. So the root lies between these two points.

Perhaps I can use linear approximation between t=10.065778 (f=-0.182) and t=10.1 (f=1.24).

The change in t is 0.034222, and the change in f is 1.422.

We need to find the t where f=0.

The fraction needed is 0.182 /1.422 ≈0.128.

So, t≈10.065778 +0.034222 *0.128≈10.065778 +0.00437≈10.07015.

So, approximately t≈10.07015.

Looking at the options, the closest is option B:10.065778, but this is just below the root. The next option higher than that isn't present; the options provided are up to J:14.567890, but none between B and J.

Wait, looking back at the options:

Options are:

A: 11.234567

B: 10.065778

C:6.789012

D:7.654321

E:9.876543

F:13.123456

G:12.345678

H:8.945321

I:9.012345

J:14.567890

So, the only option near my estimated t≈10.07 is option B:10.065778.

But at t=10.065778, f(t)=-0.182, which is below zero, so the actual t is a bit higher than 10.065778, but the next option after B is A:11.234567, which is much higher, so perhaps the intended answer is B.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the integration steps. Let me check once more.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the integrating factor or the integral. Let me double-check the integration.

The integral of e^{at} cos(bt) dt is [e^{at} (a cos(bt) + b sin(bt))]/(a² + b²) + C. Yes, that's correct.

So, for a=1/4, b=2:

Integral e^{t/4} cos(2t) dt = [e^{t/4} ( (1/4) cos(2t) + 2 sin(2t) ) ] / ( (1/4)^2 + 2^2 ) + C.

Denominator: 1/16 +4=65/16.

So, the integral is [e^{t/4} ( (1/4) cos(2t) +2 sin(2t) ) ] * (16/65) + C.

Then, the integral becomes 16/65 e^{t/4} [ (1/4 cos(2t) +2 sin(2t) ) ] + C.

Multiply by 2: (32/65) e^{t/4} [ (1/4 cos(2t) +2 sin(2t) ) ] + C.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial solution when applying the integrating factor. Let me check:

After multiplying both sides by e^{t/4}, the left side is d/dt (e^{t/4} y).

So, integrating both sides:

e^{t/4} y = ∫ e^{t/4} (3 + 2 cos(2t)) dt + C.

Yes, that's correct.

So, the solution is correct. Thus, perhaps the intended answer is option B:10.065778, as it's the first option above the calculated t≈10.008, even though f(t) is negative there. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but given the options, B is the closest.
</think>

To solve the initial value problem \( y' + \frac{1}{4}y = 3 + 2\cos(2t) \) with \( y(0) = 0 \), we first recognize it as a linear first-order differential equation. The integrating factor is \( \mu(t) = e^{\int \frac{1}{4} dt} = e^{t/4} \). Multiplying through by \( e^{t/4} \) and integrating both sides, we find the general solution:

\[
y(t) = 12 + \frac{8}{65} \cos(2t) + \frac{64}{65} \sin(2t) - \frac{788}{65} e^{-t/4}.
\]

To determine when \( y(t) = 12 \), we set the equation:

\[
\frac{8}{65} \cos(2t) + \frac{64}{65} \sin(2t) = \frac{788}{65} e^{-t/4}.
\]

Simplifying, we find:

\[
8 \cos(2t) + 64 \sin(2t) = 788 e^{-t/4}.
\]

The left-hand side can be written as \( 8\sqrt{65} \cos(2t - \phi) \), where \( \phi = \arctan(8) \). The equation becomes:

\[
8\sqrt{65} \cos(2t - \phi) = 788 e^{-t/4}.
\]

Since \( \cos(2t - \phi) \leq 1 \), we require \( 788 e^{-t/4} \leq 8\sqrt{65} \). Solving for \( t \), we find \( t \geq 10.008 \). Using numerical methods and checking the options, the closest value above this threshold is \( t = 10.065778 \).

**Answer:** B
