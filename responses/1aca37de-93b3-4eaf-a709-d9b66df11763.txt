Okay, so I've got this biology question here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. The question is asking about the coding sequences of genes and what they're called. The options are A through J, with various terms like exons, introns, codons, and others. Let me break this down.

First, I remember that genes are made up of DNA, which is composed of nucleotides. But the question is specifically about the coding sequences. I think coding sequences are the parts of the gene that actually code for proteins. So, I'm recalling that genes are divided into exons and introns. Exons are the parts that are transcribed and translated into proteins, while introns are non-coding sequences that get spliced out.

Wait, but the question is about the coding sequences. So exons are the coding parts, right? Because they're the ones that are used to make the mRNA, which then goes on to produce proteins. So if the question is asking for what the coding sequences are called, the answer should be exons. That would make option I the correct choice.

Let me double-check the other options to make sure I'm not mixing things up. Option A is exons, which I just thought about. Option B is nucleotides, but that's a building block of DNA, not the coding sequences themselves. Option C is promoters, which are regions that initiate transcription, but they're not the coding parts. Option D is anticodons, which are parts of tRNA, not the gene sequences. Option E is genomes, which refers to the entire set of genes, so that's too broad. Option F is operons, which are clusters of genes under a single promoter, but that's more about regulation than coding sequences. Option G is codons, which are sequences of three nucleotides that code for amino acids, but those are on the mRNA, not the gene itself. Option H is alleles, which are variations of a gene, so that's not it. Option J is introns, which are non-coding, so that's the opposite of what we're looking for.

So putting it all together, the coding sequences are exons. That must be option I.

The coding sequences of genes are called exons.
