Answer the following multiple choice question, selecting from the answer A through to J. After thinking, reply directly with your answer. 

The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

This question refers to the following information.
By what principle of reason then, should these foreigners send in return a poisonous drug? Without meaning to say that the foreigners harbor such destructive intentions in their hearts, we yet positively assert that from their inordinate thirst after gain, they are perfectly careless about the injuries they inflict upon us! And such being the case, we should like to ask what has become of that conscience which heaven has implanted in the breasts of all men? We have heard that in your own country opium is prohibited with the utmost strictness and severity. This is a strong proof that you know full well how hurtful it is to mankind. Since you do not permit it to injure your own country, you ought not to have this injurious drug transferred to another country, and above all others, how much less to the Inner Land! Of the products which China exports to your foreign countries, there is not one which is not beneficial to mankind in some shape or other.

Alright, I'm going to try to figure out the answer to this multiple-choice question about the outcome following Lin Zexu's letter to Queen Victoria. Let me start by understanding the context and the question.

First, the background: Lin Zexu was a Chinese trade commissioner who wrote a letter to Queen Victoria in 1839. The letter is part of the historical context leading up to the Opium Wars. From what I remember, the Opium Wars were conflicts between China and Western powers, primarily Britain, largely due to the opium trade. The Chinese were trying to stop the importation of opium, which was being forced upon them by British traders. 

Looking at the letter's content, Lin Zexu is criticizing the British for their opium trade, pointing out the harmful effects and questioning their conscience. He mentions that opium is prohibited in Britain, so it's hypocritical to sell it in China. He's asking the British to stop this trade because it's injuring the Chinese people.

Now, the question is asking which outcome followed the delivery of this letter. The options are A through J, each suggesting a different event. Let me go through them one by one.

Option A: The expulsion of all foreigners from Chinese territory. I don't think this happened directly after the letter. While the Chinese were taking strong measures against foreign influence, expulsion of all foreigners seems more like a possible outcome but perhaps not the immediate one after the letter.

Option B: Violent uprisings by China's pro-British Muslim minority. I'm not too sure about this. I don't recall any major uprisings by Muslims in China around that time related to the opium issue. It seems less likely to be the direct consequence of this letter.

Option C: The British government compensated China for the damages caused by the opium trade. This sounds like something that might happen if Britain agreed to settle, but I think the immediate response was more about conflict rather than compensation.

Option D: China and Britain entered into a period of peaceful coexistence. That doesn't seem right. The letter was part of the tension leading up to the war, so peaceful coexistence isn't the outcome.

Option E: A successful ban of opium trade in all Chinese territories. Well, Lin Zexu was against the opium trade, but after his letter, the situation escalated into conflict. So maybe a ban happened, but it's not clear if it was successful right after the letter.

Option F: The British Crown ceded Hong Kong to China. Wait, no, I think it was the other way around. After the Opium Wars, China ceded Hong Kong to Britain. So this option is the opposite of what happened.

Option G: Queen Victoria personally responded with a promise of change. I don't think she did that. The response from Britain was more likely through diplomatic channels or military actions, not a personal letter promising change.

Option H: Chinese naval defeat and new trade terms favorable to the West. This sounds more plausible. The Opium Wars led to British victories, including the Battle of Hong Kong in 1839 and the Treaty of Nanking in 1842, which opened up China to British trade and led to unfavorable terms for China.

Option I: The British government issued a formal apology and stopped the opium trade. I don't think Britain apologized or stopped the trade. Instead, they continued to push for it, leading to conflict.

Option J: The rise of a strong anti-opium movement in Britain. This might be a possibility. The letter could have sparked some internal debate in Britain about the ethics of the opium trade, leading to movements against it. However, I'm not certain if this was an immediate outcome.

Now, considering the timeline: Lin Zexu's letter was in 1839. The immediate response from Britain probably wasn't a formal apology or a movement in Britain. Instead, the British responded with military force, leading to the Opium Wars. The result of the war was the Treaty of Nanking, which included territorial concessions and trade advantages for Britain, which aligns with option H: Chinese naval defeat and new trade terms more favorable to the West.

So, putting it all together, the most likely outcome after the letter was the start of the conflict and subsequent defeat of China, leading to unfavorable trade terms.

The most likely outcome after Lin Zexu's letter was the escalation into conflict, resulting in Chinese naval defeat and new trade terms favorable to the West.
