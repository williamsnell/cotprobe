Okay, so I've got this question about banking and the demand deposit multiplier. Hmm, let me try to figure this out. I'm a bit rusty on my economics, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says that $100 is deposited into a bank, and the required reserve ratio is 100%. I need to find the demand deposit multiplier and the total addition to demand deposits from this initial deposit.

Wait, what's the demand deposit multiplier again? I remember it's related to how much money banks can create through fractional reserve banking. The formula, I think, is 1 divided by the reserve ratio. So if the reserve ratio is r, the multiplier is 1/r.

In this case, the reserve ratio is 100%, which is 1 in decimal form. So the multiplier would be 1 divided by 1, which is 1. That means the multiplier is 1.

Now, what does that mean for the total addition to demand deposits? The initial deposit is $100. But since the reserve ratio is 100%, banks are required to hold all deposits as reserves. That means they can't lend any of it out because they have to keep 100% in reserves. If they can't lend, they can't create new deposits through loans.

So, if banks can't lend, the money supply doesn't increase beyond the initial deposit. Wait, but the question is about the total addition. So the initial deposit is $100, and if the multiplier is 1, the total addition would be 100 multiplied by the multiplier. But wait, the multiplier here is 1, so it's 100 *1=100. But wait, does that mean the addition is $100 or is it including the initial deposit?

Wait, no. The demand deposit multiplier tells us how much the money supply can increase. If the reserve ratio is 100%, the multiplier is 1, so the money supply doesn't increase beyond the initial deposit. So the total addition would be zero? Or is it that the total demand deposits in the system can only be the initial $100, so the addition is zero? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, no. The demand deposit multiplier is 1, so the total increase in deposits would be $100 times the multiplier, which is 1, so $100. But does that include the initial deposit or not? Because the initial deposit is part of the process. So if the bank can't lend any, the total demand deposits would just be the initial $100, so the addition is zero? Or is the addition the same as the initial deposit?

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think again. The money multiplier formula is 1/(reserve ratio). So with a 100% reserve ratio, the multiplier is 1, meaning each dollar of reserves supports one dollar of deposits. Since the reserve ratio is 100%, the bank can't create any more deposits because they can't lend anything. So when you deposit $100, the bank must keep all $100 as reserves, and can't create any new money through lending and subsequent deposits.

Therefore, the total addition to demand deposits would be zero because no new money is created. But wait, the options don't have a zero. So maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Alternatively, perhaps the total addition is the initial deposit itself. But that doesn't make sense because the question says "resulting from the initial deposit," implying how much is added beyond that.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. If the reserve ratio is 100%, the bank cannot issue any loans. So when the $100 is deposited, the bank holds $100 in reserves, and cannot lend any. Therefore, no new deposits are created. So the total addition is zero. But in the options, I don't see a zero. Hmm.

Wait, looking at the options, option J is 1 and $100. So if the multiplier is 1, the total addition is $100. But that would mean the initial deposit plus the addition equals $200, which doesn't make sense because the bank can't create more money.

Wait, maybe the question is phrased differently. The demand deposit multiplier is 1, so the total increase in the money supply is the initial deposit times the multiplier. So $100 *1= $100. But wait, that would mean the total increase is $100, but the initial deposit was $100, so the total demand deposits would be $100. So the addition is zero? Or is the total addition $100, meaning the initial deposit plus the multiplier effect, but that would be the same as the initial.

Hmm, I'm getting confused. Let me check the options again. The options are:

A: 3 and $300

B: 0.8 and $80

C: 1.25 and $125

D: 1.5 and $150

E: 2 and $300

F: 2 and $200

G: 0.5 and $150

H: 1 and $200

I: 0.5 and $50

J: 1 and $100

So, if the multiplier is 1, then the options are H and J. H says multiplier 1 and addition $200, J says 1 and $100.

Wait, the initial deposit is $100. If the multiplier is 1, the total change in deposits would be 100*(1/(1)) =100. But since the reserve ratio is 100%, the bank can't make any new loans, so the money supply remains at $100. So the addition is zero, but that's not an option.

Alternatively, maybe the multiplier is 1, meaning the total demand deposits would be 100 + (100 *1) = 200? No, that doesn't make sense because the bank can't create more money. Or perhaps the total addition is 100 *1 =100, so the demand deposits increase by $100. But that would make the total $200, but the initial was $100, so the addition is $100. So the total addition is $100, so the multiplier is 1, and the addition is $100. That would be option J.

Wait, but if the reserve ratio is 100%, the bank can't lend, so the money supply doesn't increase. So the addition should be zero. But none of the options have zero. So I must be missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the demand deposit multiplier is 1, meaning the total demand deposits remain the same as the initial deposit. So the multiplier is 1, and the addition is zero. But since the options don't have zero, perhaps the question is asking for the maximum possible addition, which would be $100 with multiplier 1, so J is the answer.

Alternatively, maybe when the initial deposit is made, the bank holds 100% as reserves, so the demand deposits don't change beyond the initial. So the total addition is zero, but that's not an option. Maybe the question is phrased in a way that the initial deposit is the addition. But that seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The formula is:

Demand Deposit Multiplier (DDM) = 1 / Reserve Ratio.

Reserve Ratio is 100% = 1. So DDM = 1/1 =1.

Total addition to demand deposits is DDM multiplied by the initial deposit. So 1 *100 =100.

So the demand deposit multiplier is 1, and the addition is $100. So the answer is J.

Yes, I think that's it. So the answer is J.

The demand deposit multiplier is calculated as \( \frac{1}{\text{Reserve Ratio}} \). With a reserve ratio of 100% (or 1), the multiplier is \( \frac{1}{1} = 1 \). This means the total addition to demand deposits is the initial deposit multiplied by the multiplier: \( 100 \times 1 = 100 \). Therefore, the demand deposit multiplier is 1, and the total addition to demand deposits is $100.
