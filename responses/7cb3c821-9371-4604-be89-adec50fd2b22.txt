Okay, so I have this problem where I need to evaluate the line integral ∫C F · dr using Stokes' Theorem. The vector field F is given as z² i + y² j + x k, and the curve C is a triangle with vertices at (1,0,0), (0,1,0), and (0,0,1), oriented counter-clockwise.

First, I remember that Stokes' Theorem relates a line integral around a closed curve to the surface integral of the curl of the vector field over the surface bounded by that curve. The theorem is stated as ∫C F · dr = ∫∫S curl F · dS, where S is a surface bounded by C.

So, my plan is to compute the curl of F first. The curl is given by the cross product of the del operator and F. Let me compute that.

Given F = z² i + y² j + x k, the curl F would be:

curl F = ∇ × F = ( ∂F_z/∂y - ∂F_y/∂z ) i - ( ∂F_z/∂x - ∂F_x/∂z ) j + ( ∂F_y/∂x - ∂F_x/∂y ) k

Let me compute each component:

1. The i-component: ∂F_z/∂y - ∂F_y/∂z. F_z is x, so ∂F_z/∂y = 0. F_y is y², so ∂F_y/∂z = 0. So, i-component is 0 - 0 = 0.

2. The j-component: -( ∂F_z/∂x - ∂F_x/∂z ). F_z is x, so ∂F_z/∂x = 1. F_x is z², so ∂F_x/∂z = 2z. So, inside the brackets: 1 - 2z. Then the j-component is -(1 - 2z) = -1 + 2z.

3. The k-component: ∂F_y/∂x - ∂F_x/∂y. F_y is y², so ∂F_y/∂x = 0. F_x is z², so ∂F_x/∂y = 0. So, k-component is 0 - 0 = 0.

Putting it all together, curl F = (0) i + ( -1 + 2z ) j + (0) k = (0, 2z - 1, 0).

Now, I need to compute the surface integral of curl F over the surface S. Since the curve C is the boundary of the triangle, I can choose any surface that has C as its boundary. The simplest choice is the triangle itself in 3D space. However, the triangle lies in a plane, so I can parametrize it or find an equation for it.

Let me find the equation of the plane containing the three points (1,0,0), (0,1,0), and (0,0,1). To find the equation, I can use the general plane equation ax + by + cz = d. Plugging in each point:

For (1,0,0): a*1 + b*0 + c*0 = d ⇒ a = d.

For (0,1,0): a*0 + b*1 + c*0 = d ⇒ b = d.

For (0,0,1): a*0 + b*0 + c*1 = d ⇒ c = d.

So, a = b = c = d. Let me pick d = 1, so a = b = c = 1. The plane equation is x + y + z = 1.

So, the surface S is the triangle on the plane x + y + z = 1, bounded by the given vertices.

Next, I need to parametrize this surface. Alternatively, since it's a flat surface, I can compute the surface integral by projecting onto one of the coordinate planes, say the xy-plane, and compute the double integral.

But before that, I should compute dS for the surface integral. For a surface given by z = f(x,y), dS can be expressed as (√(1 + (∂f/∂x)^2 + (∂f/∂y)^2 )) dx dy. But since our surface is x + y + z = 1, we can express z = 1 - x - y, so ∂z/∂x = -1, ∂z/∂y = -1. Then, dS = √(1 + 1 + 1) dx dy = √3 dx dy. However, since the surface is not aligned with the z-axis, but we are integrating over it, perhaps it's easier to compute the surface integral using the formula involving the normal vector.

Alternatively, I can compute the surface integral by using the formula ∫∫S curl F · n dS, where n is the unit normal vector to the surface S. Since the surface is part of the plane x + y + z = 1, the normal vector can be taken as (1,1,1), but we need to make it a unit vector.

Wait, the plane x + y + z = 1 has a normal vector in the direction (1,1,1). So, the unit normal vector n is (1,1,1) divided by its magnitude. The magnitude of (1,1,1) is √(1^2 +1^2 +1^2) = √3. So, n = (1/√3, 1/√3, 1/√3).

But wait, since the orientation is given as counter-clockwise when viewed from above, I need to ensure the normal vector is oriented correctly. The right-hand rule says that if the thumb points in the direction of n, the fingers curl in the direction of the curve's orientation. So, the normal should point upwards. The (1,1,1) vector points in the positive direction, so n is correctly oriented.

So, to compute ∫∫S curl F · n dS, I can use the formula:

∫∫S (curl F) · n dS = ∫∫D (curl F) · (n dS), where D is the projection of S onto the xy-plane.

Wait, but another approach is to realize that for a flat surface, the surface integral can be computed as ∫∫ curl F · n dS = ∫∫ curl F · (n dS), and since n is constant over the surface, we can factor it out as n · ∫∫ (curl F) dS projected onto the surface.

Wait, no, that's not quite right. The more accurate approach is to compute the flux through the surface, which is ∫∫S (curl F) · n dS. But since n is constant over the surface, we can write this as n · ∫∫S (curl F) dS. But actually, no, because curl F is a function over the surface, not a constant. Hmm, perhaps another approach.

Wait, perhaps it's better to parametrize the surface S. Let me try that.

Parametrizing the triangle. Let me use two parameters u and v, but maybe it's easier to express in terms of x and y. Since S is the triangle with vertices (1,0,0), (0,1,0), and (0,0,1), which lies on the plane x + y + z = 1. So, I can express z = 1 - x - y, and the domain D in the xy-plane is the projection of the triangle onto the xy-plane. The projection would be a triangle with vertices (1,0), (0,1), and (0,0) because when z=0, x+y=1.

Wait, no, actually, the projection of the triangle onto the xy-plane would be the triangle bounded by x=0, y=0, and x + y = 1. Because when z=0, x + y = 1, so the projection is the triangle with vertices (1,0), (0,1), and (0,0).

So, I can parametrize the surface S using x and y as parameters, with x ≥ 0, y ≥ 0, and x + y ≤ 1. Then, z = 1 - x - y. So, the parametrization r(x, y) = (x, y, 1 - x - y), where (x, y) ∈ D, which is the triangle in the xy-plane.

Now, to compute the surface integral, I need to compute the normal vector based on this parametrization. The normal vector can be found using the cross product of the partial derivatives of r with respect to x and y.

Compute r_x = ∂r/∂x = (1, 0, -1)
Compute r_y = ∂r/∂y = (0, 1, -1)
Then, r_x × r_y = determinant of the matrix:
i   j   k
1   0  -1
0   1  -1

= i*(0*(-1) - (-1)*1) - j*(1*(-1) - (-1)*0) + k*(1*1 - 0*0)
= i*(0 +1) - j*(-1 -0) + k*(1 -0)
= i*(1) - j*(-1) + k*(1)
= (1, 1, 1)

This vector (1,1,1) is the normal vector to the surface, pointing upwards, which matches our earlier normal vector. But since the cross product gives a vector whose magnitude is the area scaling factor, the magnitude of (1,1,1) is √3, so the unit normal vector is (1,1,1)/√3, as before.

Now, the surface integral becomes ∫∫D curl F · (r_x × r_y) dx dy. But wait, no. Wait, actually, the surface integral is ∫∫S curl F · dS, where dS is the vector area element. Since r_x × r_y gives the vector area element, which is (1,1,1) dx dy. So, dS = (1,1,1) dx dy.

Wait, but the curl F is (0, 2z -1, 0). Let me express z in terms of x and y: z = 1 - x - y. So, curl F = (0, 2(1 - x - y) -1, 0) = (0, 2 - 2x - 2y -1, 0) = (0, 1 - 2x - 2y, 0).

So, curl F = (0, 1 - 2x - 2y, 0).

Now, the surface integral becomes ∫∫D [curl F] · [r_x × r_y] dx dy.

But r_x × r_y is (1,1,1), as computed earlier. So, the dot product [curl F] · (1,1,1) is (0)(1) + (1 - 2x - 2y)(1) + (0)(1) = 1 - 2x - 2y.

Thus, the integral becomes ∫∫D (1 - 2x - 2y) dx dy, where D is the triangle x ≥ 0, y ≥ 0, x + y ≤ 1.

So, I need to compute the double integral of (1 - 2x - 2y) over D. Let me set up the limits for x and y. Since D is the triangle with vertices at (0,0), (1,0), and (0,1), I can integrate x from 0 to 1, and for each x, y from 0 to 1 - x.

So, the integral is ∫ (x=0 to 1) ∫ (y=0 to 1 - x) [1 - 2x - 2y] dy dx.

Let me compute the inner integral first with respect to y:

∫ (y=0 to 1 - x) [1 - 2x - 2y] dy.

Let me make substitution u = y. Then, the integral becomes:

∫ [1 - 2x - 2u] du from u=0 to u=1 - x.

Integrate term by term:

∫ (1 - 2x) du = (1 - 2x) * u evaluated from 0 to 1 -x.

∫ (-2u) du = -u^2 evaluated from 0 to 1 -x.

So, adding these together:

(1 - 2x)(1 - x) - ( (1 - x)^2 )

Expanding:

= (1)(1 - x) - 2x(1 - x) - (1 - 2x + x^2)
= (1 - x) - 2x + 2x^2 -1 + 2x - x^2
Wait, perhaps it's better to compute each part step by step.

First term: (1 - 2x) * (1 - x) = (1)(1) + (1)(-x) + (-2x)(1) + (-2x)(-x)
= 1 - x - 2x + 2x^2
= 1 - 3x + 2x^2.

Second term: - ( (1 - x)^2 ) = -(1 - 2x + x^2) = -1 + 2x - x^2.

Adding the two terms together:

(1 - 3x + 2x^2) + (-1 + 2x - x^2) = (1 -1) + (-3x + 2x) + (2x^2 - x^2)
= 0 - x + x^2
= x^2 - x.

So, the inner integral evaluates to x^2 - x.

Now, the outer integral is ∫ (x=0 to 1) (x^2 - x) dx.

Compute this integral:

∫ x^2 dx from 0 to1 = [x^3/3] from 0 to1 = 1/3 - 0 = 1/3.

∫ x dx from 0 to1 = [x^2/2] from 0 to1 = 1/2 - 0 = 1/2.

So, the integral becomes (1/3) - (1/2) = (2/6 - 3/6) = (-1/6).

Wait, that's the value of the surface integral ∫∫S curl F · dS = (-1/6).

But wait, according to Stokes' Theorem, the line integral ∫C F · dr equals this surface integral, which is (-1/6). Let me check the options:

Options are A: 0.166, B: -1.000, C: -0.166, D: 0.333, E: 0.500, F: 0.666, G: -0.333, H: -0.500, I: -0.666, J: 1.000.

-1/6 is approximately -0.1667, which is option C: -0.166.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake.

Wait, the integral of (1 - 2x - 2y) over D being (-1/6) seems correct? Let me recompute the inner integral.

Wait, the inner integral after substitution was [ (1 - 2x)(1 - x) - (1 - x)^2 ].

Wait, (1 - 2x)(1 - x) = 1*(1) + 1*(-x) -2x*(1) + (-2x)*(-x) = 1 -x -2x + 2x^2 = 1 -3x + 2x^2.

Then, subtract (1 - x)^2 = 1 -2x +x^2.

So, 1 -3x +2x^2 -1 +2x -x^2 = (1-1) + (-3x +2x) + (2x^2 -x^2) = 0 -x +x^2 = x^2 -x.

That seems correct. Then, integrating x^2 -x from 0 to1 gives [x^3/3 - x^2/2] from 0 to1 = (1/3 - 1/2) - 0 = (2/6 -3/6) = -1/6.

So the surface integral is -1/6, which is approximately -0.1667, so option C.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the orientation. The problem states that the triangle has counter-clockwise rotation. So, when applying Stokes' Theorem, the orientation of the normal vector should follow the right-hand rule. If the curve is oriented counter-clockwise when viewed from above, the normal vector should point upwards, which it does in our case, so the calculation should be correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the parametrization or the curl computation.

Wait, let's re-examine the curl F. F = z² i + y² j + x k.

curl F = (∂F_z/∂y - ∂F_y/∂z) i - (∂F_z/∂x - ∂F_x/∂z) j + (∂F_y/∂x - ∂F_x/∂y) k.

Compute each component again:

∂F_z/∂y = ∂x/∂y = 0.

∂F_y/∂z = ∂(y²)/∂z = 0.

So, i-component is 0 - 0 = 0.

∂F_z/∂x = ∂x/∂x = 1.

∂F_x/∂z = ∂(z²)/∂z = 2z.

So, j-component is -(1 - 2z).

k-component:

∂F_y/∂x = ∂(y²)/∂x = 0.

∂F_x/∂y = ∂(z²)/∂y = 0.

So, k-component is 0.

So, curl F = (0, 2z -1, 0). That's correct.

Then, the parametrization of the surface is correct, with z=1 -x -y.

So, the curl F evaluated on the surface is (0, 2(1 -x -y) -1, 0) = (0, 2 -2x -2y -1, 0) = (0,1 -2x -2y, 0).

Then, the dot product with (1,1,1) is 0*1 + (1-2x-2y)*1 + 0*1 = 1 - 2x -2y.

The integral over D is correct.

So, the final answer is -1/6, which is option C: -0.166.

Wait, but let me check another approach. Perhaps using a different parametrization or another method to compute the surface integral.

Alternative approach: using the formula for the flux through a plane.

The surface integral ∫∫S curl F · dS can also be computed as ∫∫ curl F · n dS, where n is the unit normal vector.

We have n = (1,1,1)/√3.

So, the integral becomes ∫∫S (curl F) · (1,1,1)/√3 dS.

But dS on the plane can be expressed as √3 dx dy, as earlier. So:

∫∫S curl F · n dS = ∫∫D (curl F · n) * √3 dx dy.

Wait, no, because dS is the area element, which for the parametrization r(x,y) is |r_x × r_y| dx dy = √3 dx dy. So, the integral is:

∫∫D (curl F · (r_x × r_y)) dx dy / |r_x × r_y| * |r_x × r_y| dx dy ?

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of it as:

∫∫S (curl F) · n dS = ∫∫D (curl F · (r_x × r_y)) / |r_x × r_y| * |r_x × r_y| dx dy

Wait, no, because dS = (r_x × r_y) dx dy, so the integral becomes ∫∫D (curl F) · (r_x × r_y) dx dy.

Which is the same as what I computed earlier, leading to the integral of (1 - 2x -2y) over D.

So, the result is -1/6, so the answer is option C: -0.166.
</think>

To evaluate the line integral ∫C F · dr using Stokes' Theorem, we first compute the curl of the vector field F = z² i + y² j + x k. The curl is found to be (0, 2z - 1, 0). Next, we parametrize the triangular surface S bounded by the curve C, which lies on the plane x + y + z = 1. The normal vector to this plane is (1, 1, 1), and the unit normal vector is (1/√3, 1/√3, 1/√3). 

Using Stokes' Theorem, the line integral is equivalent to the surface integral of the curl of F over S. Projecting the triangle onto the xy-plane, we compute the double integral of (1 - 2x - 2y) over the triangular region D. Evaluating this integral yields -1/6, which corresponds to option C: -0.166.

Answer: C
