Question:

A previously healthy 19-year-old college student comes to student health services 24 hours after the onset of headache, stiff neck, and sensitivity to light. She does not recall any sick contacts. She had chickenpox at the age of 7 years. Her most recent examination 1 year ago included PPD skin testing and showed no abnormalities. She takes a daily multivitamin and an herbal weight-loss preparation. She received all appropriate immunizations during childhood but has not received any since then. She does not smoke, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. There is no family history of serious illness. She appears lethargic. Her temperature is 39.1°C (102.4°F), pulse is 112/min, respirations are 20/min, and blood pressure is 100/68 mm Hg. Examination shows diffuse petechiae. Kernig and Brudzinski signs are present. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. A lumbar puncture is performed. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis shows numerous segmented neutrophils and a decreased glucose concentration. A Gram stain of the CSF shows gram-negative cocci. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy?

Options:

A: Ceftriaxone
B: Clindamycin
C: Erythromycin
D: Metronidazole

Okay, so I'm looking at this question about a 19-year-old college student who comes in with a headache, stiff neck, and sensitivity to light. These symptoms make me think of meningitis because those are classic signs. She doesn't remember being around anyone sick, so maybe it's not contagious from someone else. She had chickenpox as a kid, which I guess is relevant maybe for other reasons, but not sure yet.

Her last check-up was a year ago, and her PPD was negative, so no TB there. She's taking a multivitamin and an herbal weight-loss supplement, which could have interactions, but I don't know if that's relevant here. No other health issues mentioned. No smoking, drinking, or drugs, so probably no risk factors for other infections.

On exam, she's lethargic, which is concerning. Her temp is 39.1, which is pretty high, and her pulse and respirations are elevated, which makes sense with a fever. Blood pressure is a bit low, maybe from dehydration or something else. The key thing here is the diffuse petechiae—those are small red spots on the skin, possibly from bleeding, which can happen in meningitis. Kernig and Brudzinski signs are present. I remember those are signs of meningeal irritation. Kernig's is when you can't straighten the knee when the hip is flexed, and Brudzinski's is when flexing the neck causes the legs to flex. Both indicate meningitis.

The CSF analysis shows lots of neutrophils, which are a type of white blood cell that's usually involved in bacterial infections. The glucose is low, which is another clue for bacterial meningitis because in bacterial cases, glucose tends to decrease. The Gram stain showing gram-negative cocci—so that's a clue. Gram-negative bacteria like Neisseria meningitidis (meningococcus) or Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumo) are common causes. Herpes simplex can cause viral meningitis, which usually has different CSF findings, like more lymphocytes.

So, the question is about the most appropriate pharmacotherapy. The options are Ceftriaxone, Clindamycin, Erythromycin, Metronidazole.

Ceftriaxone is a third-generation cephalosporin, effective against meningococci and some other gram-negative bacteria. Clindamycin is a macrolide, used for gram-positive like strep, but maybe not the first choice for bacterial meningitis. Erythromycin is another macrolide, but same issue. Metronidazole is for anaerobes and some other bugs, not typically the mainstay for meningitis.

So, given the Gram stain shows gram-negative cocci, which are likely meningococcal or pneumococcal. Ceftriaxone is a good choice for meningococcal. For pneumococcal, ampicillin or other beta-lactams are used, but ceftriaxone is also effective against some strains. In meningitis, treatment usually starts with something broad like a cephalosporin, then adjusted based on culture results. Since the Gram stain is positive for gram-negative, ceftriaxone seems appropriate.

The patient presents with symptoms consistent with meningitis, including headache, stiff neck, sensitivity to light, and positive Kernig and Brudzinski signs. The presence of diffuse petechiae and CSF findings (numerous segmented neutrophils, decreased glucose) further support a bacterial meningitis diagnosis. The Gram stain showing gram-negative cocci points toward Neisseria meningitidis or Streptococcus pneumoniae as potential pathogens. Ceftriaxone is the most appropriate treatment due to its efficacy against gram-negative bacteria commonly causing meningitis. 

A: Ceftriaxone

ANSWER: A
