Okay, so I need to figure out what the Quantity Equation of Exchange is. I remember from my economics class that it's one of those fundamental formulas. Let me think. The Quantity Equation... I think it relates money supply, velocity, price levels, and output or transactions.

Wait, the equation is usually written as M times V equals P times Q, right? Or maybe M multiplied by V equals P multiplied by T, where T is transactions. But sometimes they use Q for output or the quantity of transactions. So, the basic idea is that the total money in circulation multiplied by how many times each unit of money is used (velocity) equals the price level multiplied by the quantity of goods and services transacted.

Looking at the options, I need to find which one matches M*V = P*Q. Let me go through each choice. 

Option A: M = PQ/V. Hmm, that's rearranged from M*V = P*Q. So this would be solving for M, but the equation isn't typically presented that way. It's more about the relationship between all four variables together.

Option B: PQ = MV. Oh, that looks right. PQ on one side and MV on the other. So, P times Q equals M times V. That's the basic form I remember.

Option C: PQ ≡ M/V. No, that's not right. The velocity isn't divided; it's multiplied.

Option D: PQ = M + V. That doesn't make sense because M and V are multiplied, not added.

Option E: V = PQ/M. Again, that's solving for V, but the main equation is PQ equals MV, not this rearranged version for V.

Option F: P/Q = MV. No, that's not it. It's PQ, not P/Q.

Option G: QV = PM. Rearranged, that's QV = PM, which is the same as MV = PQ, so that's equivalent to option B. Wait, so both B and G look similar because they're just rearranged. Oh, but I need to check the notation. QV is Q*V, which is same as V*Q. So yes, that's the same as PQ = MV. So both B and G seem correct? But wait, the options are all distinct, so maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, let me read the options again. Option B is PQ = MV, which is the standard form. Option G is QV = PM, which is the same as MV = PQ, so it's just rearranged. So both B and G represent the same equation. But in the options, they're separate. Wait, but the question is asking for the Quantity Equation of Exchange. The standard form is usually written as MV = PT, where T is transactions. But sometimes it's written as PQ, so maybe both B and G are correct? But that can't be because in the options, each letter is a separate choice. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, no, the Quantity Equation is often expressed as M * V = P * Q, where Q is the quantity of transactions. So in that case, the correct equation would be PQ = MV, which is option B. Alternatively, it could be written as MV = PQ, which is the same thing. So both B and J are the same equation but written differently. Let me check option J: PQ ≡ MV. That's also correct because it's stating that PQ is equal to MV. So both B and J are correct in terms of equation, but in the options, they're separate.

Wait, looking back, option B is PQ = MV, and option J is PQ ≡ MV. The only difference is the equality symbol. Usually, the equation is stated as an equality, so both are correct, but perhaps the way they're written matters. Alternatively, maybe the question expects the standard form as MV = PQ, which would correspond to option B if written as PQ = MV. Or maybe it's presented as PQ = MV, which is option B.

Wait, no, actually, I think the standard form is usually written as M * V = P * Q, or sometimes as P * Q = M * V. So both B and J are correct in terms of the equation, but they use different symbols. Option J uses the equivalence symbol ≡, which might be used in some contexts, but the standard is usually an equals sign. So option B is PQ = MV, which is correct, and option J is PQ ≡ MV, which is also correct but perhaps more about an identity rather than an equation. 

Wait, but the question is about the Quantity Equation of Exchange, which is an identity, so maybe option J is better because it uses ≡, which denotes an identity. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the standard equation is MV = PT, so when written as PQ, it's MV = PQ, so option J says PQ ≡ MV, which would be the same as MV ≡ PQ. So that's correct too.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The Quantity Equation is an identity that holds true by definition, so it's written as an equality. So the options B and J are both correct, but perhaps the way they present it is different. However, looking at the options, option B is PQ = MV, which is correct, and option J is PQ ≡ MV. So both are correct. But in the options, only one is correct, so perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, the Quantity Equation is usually written as M * V = P * T, where T is the volume of transactions. So if Q is used instead of T, then it's M * V = P * Q, which is the same as PQ = MV. So that's option B. Alternatively, sometimes it's written with the equivalence symbol, but I'm not sure if that's standard. So perhaps the correct answer is B.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is J because it uses the equivalence symbol, but I think the standard is just the equals sign. So I'm leaning towards option B: PQ = MV.

The Quantity Equation of Exchange is a fundamental identity in economics that relates the money supply (M), the velocity of money (V), the price level (P), and the quantity of transactions (Q). It is typically expressed as M * V = P * Q, which can also be written as PQ = MV. Among the given options, **B: PQ = MV** correctly represents the equation in its standard form.

Answer: B
