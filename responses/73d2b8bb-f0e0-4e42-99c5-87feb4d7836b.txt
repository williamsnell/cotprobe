Okay, so I've got this problem about water flowing through a pipe in a reactor, and I need to find the length of pipe required for heat transfer and the maximum exit temperature. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the problem states that water enters the pipe at 290 K and the reactor has a maximum power rating of 150 W per meter. The operating temperature is 350 K, and the flow rate is 5 kg/hr. The pipe's internal diameter is 0.005 m. I think I need to calculate the length of the pipe for part (a) and the exit temperature for part (b).

Wait, I'm a bit confused about the approach here. I remember that heat transfer in such cases can be calculated using the energy balance. The heat added per unit time should equal the mass flow rate multiplied by the specific heat capacity and the temperature change.

So, the formula would be Q = m_dot * c_p * (T_exit - T_inlet). But I also need to relate this to the power rating. Since the power rating is per meter, the total power would be 150 W/m multiplied by the length L. So, Q = 150 * L.

Wait, but I should check the units. The mass flow rate is given in kg/hr. I'll need to convert that to kg/s because the power is in watts, which is per second. So, 5 kg/hr is 5/3600 kg/s, which is approximately 0.001389 kg/s.

I think I need the specific heat capacity of water. I remember that c_p for water is about 4.18 kJ/kg·K, which is 4180 J/kg·K.

Now, the heat added per second would be Q = m_dot * c_p * (T_exit - T_inlet). But since the reactor's maximum power is 150 W per meter, the heat input is also Q = 150 * L, where L is the length in meters.

So setting these equal: 150 * L = m_dot * c_p * (T_exit - T_inlet).

But wait, the problem says the reactor has a maximum power rating of 150 W per meter. So the total power available for heating is 150 * L. Since we're trying to find L, perhaps we can express L in terms of the temperature change.

Wait, but I'm not sure if the operating temperature of 350 K is the exit temperature. Or is it the maximum possible? I think the exit temperature would be 350 K because that's the operating temperature of the reactor. So the maximum exit temperature would be 350 K. That makes sense because the reactor's operating temp is fixed, so the water can't exit hotter than that.

So, if the exit temp is 350 K, then the temperature change is 350 - 290 = 60 K.

Now, plugging the numbers into the equation:

150 * L = m_dot * c_p * ΔT

m_dot = 5 kg/hr = 5/3600 kg/s ≈ 0.0013889 kg/s

c_p = 4180 J/kg·K

ΔT = 60 K

So:

150 * L = 0.0013889 * 4180 * 60

Let me calculate the right side:

0.0013889 * 4180 = approximately 5.7778 J/s·K

Multiply by 60 K: 5.7778 * 60 ≈ 346.67 J/s, which is 346.67 W.

So 150 * L = 346.67 W

So L = 346.67 / 150 ≈ 2.311 m.

Looking at the options, option J has (a) 2.32 m, which is close to this. Part (b) of option J is 367.07 K, but wait, I thought the exit temp was 350 K. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, perhaps I misunderstood the operating temperature. Maybe the reactor's operating temperature is 350 K, but the water's maximum exit temp is less than that? Or maybe the reactor's temp is the maximum the water can reach. Hmm.

Wait, the problem says the reactor has a maximum power rating, so perhaps the heat transfer is limited by that power, and the exit temperature depends on how much heat can be added within the pipe length. Oh, wait, that's another way to approach it.

Wait, maybe I need to calculate the heat transfer using the pipe's maximum power and then see what the exit temperature is, given the length. But earlier I assumed the exit temp was 350 K, which led to L ≈ 2.31 m, matching option J's part (a). But option J's part (b) is 367 K, which is higher than 350. That can't be right because the reactor's operating temperature is 350. So perhaps I messed up.

Wait, maybe the 350 K is the temperature of the reactor, and the water can be heated up to that. So the maximum exit temp would be 350 K. So part (b) of option J is 367 K, which is higher than 350, so that can't be. Therefore, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the maximum power is per meter, so the total power available is 150 * L. But perhaps the heat transfer is limited by the reactor's temperature, so the maximum possible heat transfer is when the water reaches 350 K. So the calculation I did earlier gives L ≈ 2.31 m, which would make the exit temp 350 K.

But looking at the options, option J's part (a) is 2.32 m and part (b) is 367 K, which doesn't match. So maybe I did something wrong.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the flow rate more accurately. Let me recalculate the right side.

m_dot = 5 kg/hr = 5/3600 ≈ 0.0013889 kg/s.

c_p = 4180 J/kg·K.

ΔT = 350 -290=60 K.

So m_dot * c_p * ΔT = 0.0013889 * 4180 * 60.

Calculating 0.0013889 *4180: 0.0013889 *4000 =5.5556, and 0.0013889 *180=0.25, so total ≈5.8056 J/s·K.

Multiply by 60: 5.8056 *60 ≈348.336 W.

So 150 W/m * L = 348.336 W → L= 348.336 /150 ≈2.3222 m. So that's approximately 2.32 m, which matches option J's part (a).

But part (b) of option J is 367 K, which is higher than the reactor's temp. That seems impossible. So perhaps the exit temp can't exceed 350 K, so part (b) is 350 K. But looking at the options, option J's part (b) is 367, which is higher, so maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the reactor's operating temperature is 350 K, but the water can be heated beyond that because it's flowing through. No, that doesn't make sense because the reactor's temperature would limit the maximum heat transfer.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is that the power is the maximum, so the length calculated is the minimum needed to reach the maximum exit temp of 350 K. So part (a) is 2.32 m and part (b) is 350 K. But looking at the options, option J's part (b) is 367 K, which isn't 350.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming the exit temp is 350 K. Maybe the reactor's operating temperature is 350 K, but the water's exit temperature is determined by the heat added, which could be higher. But that doesn't seem right because the reactor's temp is probably the maximum it can transfer.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the exit temperature using the heat added based on the pipe length. Let me think differently.

If I'm to find the maximum exit temperature, perhaps I can use the heat input based on the power and the length. But without knowing the length, I can't find the temperature. Alternatively, perhaps the maximum temperature is when the heat is supplied as much as possible, but I'm a bit stuck.

Wait, maybe I should approach it differently. Let's first calculate the mass flow rate correctly.

m_dot = 5 kg/hr = 5/3600 kg/s ≈0.0013889 kg/s.

The specific heat capacity of water is 4.18 kJ/kg·K = 4180 J/kg·K.

The maximum power available is 150 W/m. So for a length L, the total power is 150 * L W.

The heat added per second is 150 * L = m_dot * c_p * (T_exit - T_inlet).

So T_exit = T_inlet + (150 * L)/(m_dot * c_p).

But if the reactor's operating temperature is 350 K, perhaps the maximum T_exit is 350 K. So we can set T_exit =350 K, then solve for L.

So 350 =290 + (150 * L)/(m_dot * c_p).

So ΔT=60 K = (150 * L)/(m_dot * c_p).

Rearranging, L= (60 * m_dot * c_p)/150.

Plugging in the numbers:

60 * 0.0013889 *4180 = let's calculate that.

0.0013889 *4180 ≈5.8056.

5.8056 *60 ≈348.336.

348.336 /150 ≈2.3222 m.

So L≈2.32 m, which is option J's part (a).

But part (b) would be the exit temp, which we set as 350 K. But in the options, option J's part (b) is 367.07 K, which doesn't match. So perhaps I'm missing something here.

Wait, perhaps the reactor's operating temperature is the temperature of the heat source, and the water is heated from 290 K to a higher temperature, up to the point where the power per meter is used. Wait, but the power is per meter, so the longer the pipe, the more heat can be added. But the reactor's operating temp is 350 K, so perhaps the maximum exit temp is 350 K. So the calculation I did for L=2.32 m would give an exit temp of 350 K. So part (b) is 350 K.

Looking back at the options, option J's part (a) is 2.32 m, and part (b) is 367 K, which doesn't match. So perhaps I'm making a mistake.

Alternatively, maybe the problem allows the exit temp to be higher than 350 K because the reactor's temp is fixed, but the water can absorb more heat if the pipe is longer. Wait, but the power is maximum per meter, so longer pipes allow more heat. Hmm, but the reactor's temp is 350 K, so the water can't be heated beyond that, I think.

Wait, perhaps the 350 K is the temperature of the reactor walls, so the maximum possible heat transfer is when the water reaches 350 K. Therefore, the exit temp is 350 K, and the length is 2.32 m, which matches option J's part (a). But part (b) in option J is 367 K, which is higher than 350, so that's impossible. Therefore, maybe the correct option isn't J.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recalculate.

m_dot =5 kg/hr =5/3600 ≈0.0013889 kg/s.

c_p=4180 J/kg·K.

ΔT=60 K.

So m_dot *c_p*ΔT=0.0013889 *4180 *60.

0.0013889 *4180 = approximately 5.7778 (because 0.001 *4180=4.18, 0.0003889*4180≈1.616, total ≈5.796).

5.796 *60 ≈347.76 W.

Total power needed is 347.76 W.

Since the maximum power per meter is 150 W/m, the length L=347.76 /150 ≈2.318 m≈2.32 m.

So part (a) is 2.32 m, which is option J.

But part (b) is 350 K, but option J says 367 K. So perhaps the options are wrong, or I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Alternatively, maybe the operating temperature of 350 K is the temperature of the water, meaning the exit temp is 350 K, so part (b) is 350 K. But none of the options have (a) 2.32 m and (b) 350 K. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options:

Option J: (a) 2.32 m, (b) 367.07 K.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Maybe the heat transfer is not based on the maximum possible ΔT, but using the heat capacity and the power.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula for heat transfer in a pipe, considering the flow rate and the pipe's inner diameter to find the velocity and then use the heat transfer coefficient. But that seems more complicated, and the problem might not require that since it gives the power per meter.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is assuming that the heat transfer is sufficient to raise the temperature to the maximum possible, which is 350 K, so the length is 2.32 m, and the exit temp is 350 K. But since none of the options have that, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the calculation of m_dot. Let me double-check. 5 kg/hr is 5 divided by 3600 seconds, which is indeed approximately 0.0013889 kg/s.

Alternatively, perhaps the specific heat is given differently. Maybe it's 4.186 kJ/kg·K, but that's close enough.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem uses the formula Q = (m c_p ΔT) and equates it to P*L.

So, Q = m c_p ΔT = (m_dot * Δt) * c_p * ΔT.

Wait, no, m is mass flow rate, so m = m_dot * t, where t is time. But in power terms, Q is power * time, so maybe I'm complicating it.

I think my initial approach was correct. So the length is approximately 2.32 m, and the exit temp is 350 K. But since option J's part (b) is 367 K, which is higher, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming the exit temp is 350 K.

Wait, perhaps the reactor's operating temperature is higher, and the exit temp can be higher than 350 K. Let me think again.

Wait, the problem says the operating temperature is 350 K. So the water can't be heated beyond that, as the reactor's walls are at 350 K. So the maximum exit temp is 350 K.

So, with that, the correct answer for part (a) is 2.32 m, and part (b) is 350 K. But none of the options have that combination. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options, option J is (a) 2.32 m, (b) 367.07 K. So part (a) matches, but part (b) doesn't. So perhaps I'm wrong about the exit temp.

Alternatively, maybe the reactor's operating temperature is the temperature of the heat source, and the water's exit temp can be higher if the pipe is longer. But that doesn't make sense because the heat source can't be colder than the water.

Wait, perhaps the reactor's operating temperature is the maximum allowed for the reactor, not the heat source. Maybe the heat source is at a higher temperature, but the reactor can only operate up to 350 K. Hmm, this is getting confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the exit temp based on the length found. Since L=2.32 m, then the heat added is 150 *2.32 =348 W.

Then, the temperature rise ΔT = Q/(m_dot c_p) = 348 / (0.0013889 *4180).

Calculating denominator: 0.0013889 *4180 ≈5.7778.

So ΔT=348 /5.7778≈60.2 K.

So exit temp=290 +60.2=350.2 K, which rounds to 350 K. So part (b) is 350 K.

But option J says part (b) is 367 K, which is way off. Therefore, perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I made a calculation error in the ΔT. Let me recalculate ΔT.

Q =150 * L =150 *2.3222≈348.33 W.

m_dot c_p =0.0013889 *4180≈5.7778 W/K.

So ΔT=348.33 /5.7778≈60.2 K.

So exit temp=290+60.2=350.2 K≈350 K.

So part (b) is 350 K. But none of the options have (a) 2.32 m and (b)350 K. Looking back, option J is the only one with part (a) as 2.32 m, but part (b) is 367 K, which is higher.

Wait, perhaps the problem didn't specify that the exit temp can't exceed the reactor's temp, so perhaps the exit temp is higher. Let me think differently.

Wait, maybe the reactor's operating temperature is the maximum allowable for the reactor, but the water can be heated beyond that if the pipe is longer. But that doesn't make sense because the reactor's temp would limit the heat transfer.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the thermal resistance or other factors, but the problem seems to provide enough info without needing that.

I'm a bit stuck here. My calculations lead me to part (a) being approximately 2.32 m and part (b) being 350 K. Since option J's part (a) matches, but part (b) doesn't, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming the exit temp is 350 K.

Wait, perhaps the problem doesn't assume the exit temp is limited by the reactor's temp. Maybe the reactor can supply heat beyond its temp? That doesn't make sense physically, but perhaps in the problem's context, it's allowed.

Alternatively, perhaps the reactor's operating temperature is the temperature of the water at the exit. So the exit temp is 350 K, and the length is 2.32 m, which would make option J the correct choice despite the higher exit temp. But that seems contradictory.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the calculations again.

m_dot =5 kg/hr=5/3600≈0.0013889 kg/s.

c_p=4180 J/kg·K.

ΔT= (150 * L) / (m_dot *c_p).

If L=2.32 m, then Q=150 *2.32=348 W.

ΔT=348/(0.0013889*4180)=348/5.7778≈60.2 K.

So exit temp=290+60.2=350.2 K≈350 K.

So part (b) is 350 K. But option J's part (b) is 367 K, which doesn't match. Therefore, perhaps the correct answer isn't option J, and I made a mistake in the approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different specific heat value. Let me check: sometimes, specific heat of water is approximated as 4.18 kJ/kg·K, which is 4180 J/kg·K, which I used. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using imperial units or different values. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the pipe diameter to calculate velocity and perhaps the heat transfer coefficient, but the problem doesn't provide enough info for that. It only gives the power per meter, so I think the initial approach is correct.

Given that, I think the correct answer is option J for part (a), but part (b) would be 350 K, which isn't listed. Therefore, perhaps the intended answer is option J, assuming part (b) is a typo or miscalculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for another approach. Maybe the problem uses the formula for heat transfer in a pipe with forced convection, using the Dittus-Boelter equation or something similar. But without more data like velocity, thermal conductivity, or the heat transfer coefficient, I can't apply that.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to calculate the velocity first. Let me try that.

The pipe's internal diameter is 0.005 m, so radius r=0.0025 m.

The cross-sectional area A=πr²=π*(0.0025)^2≈3.1416*(6.25e-6)=1.9635e-5 m².

The velocity v= m_dot / (A * rho), where rho is the density of water. At 290 K, the density of water is roughly 996 kg/m³.

So v= (0.0013889 kg/s) / (1.9635e-5 m² *996 kg/m³).

Calculating denominator: 1.9635e-5 *996≈0.01955 m²·kg/m³=0.01955 kg/(m·s).

So v=0.0013889 /0.01955≈0.071 m/s.

But I'm not sure how this helps without more info on heat transfer coefficients or other parameters. The problem might not require this since it gives the power per meter.

Given that, I think I should stick with my initial calculation. So the length is approximately 2.32 m and exit temp is 350 K. Since option J's part (a) is correct, perhaps the intended answer is J, and part (b) is a mistake.
</think>

To solve the problem, we calculate the length of pipe required for heat transfer and the maximum exit temperature of the water. The reactor has a maximum power rating of 150 W per meter, and the water flows at a rate of 5 kg/hr with an initial temperature of 290 K. The specific heat capacity of water is approximately 4180 J/kg·K.

### Step 1: Convert the flow rate to kg/s
The mass flow rate is given as 5 kg/hr, which converts to:
\[
\dot{m} = \frac{5}{3600} \approx 0.0013889 \, \text{kg/s}.
\]

### Step 2: Heat transfer equation
The heat added per unit time is:
\[
Q = \dot{m} \cdot c_p \cdot \Delta T,
\]
where \( c_p = 4180 \, \text{J/kg·K} \) and \( \Delta T = T_{\text{exit}} - T_{\text{inlet}} \).

The total power available for heating is:
\[
Q = 150 \cdot L,
\]
where \( L \) is the length of the pipe in meters. Equating the two expressions for \( Q \):
\[
150 \cdot L = \dot{m} \cdot c_p \cdot \Delta T.
\]

### Step 3: Solve for \( L \)
Assuming the maximum exit temperature is the reactor's operating temperature of 350 K:
\[
\Delta T = 350 - 290 = 60 \, \text{K}.
\]
Substitute the values:
\[
150 \cdot L = 0.0013889 \cdot 4180 \cdot 60.
\]
Calculate the right-hand side:
\[
0.0013889 \cdot 4180 \approx 5.7778, \quad 5.7778 \cdot 60 \approx 346.67 \, \text{W}.
\]
Thus:
\[
L = \frac{346.67}{150} \approx 2.311 \, \text{m}.
\]

### Step 4: Maximum exit temperature
Since the reactor's operating temperature is 350 K, the maximum exit temperature of the water is also 350 K.

### Step 5: Match with options
From the calculations:
- \( L \approx 2.32 \, \text{m} \) (closest to option J's part (a)).
- \( T_{\text{exit}} = 350 \, \text{K} \).

However, option J lists the exit temperature as 367.07 K, which is inconsistent with the reactor's operating temperature. Despite this discrepancy, the length calculation aligns with option J.

**Answer:** J
