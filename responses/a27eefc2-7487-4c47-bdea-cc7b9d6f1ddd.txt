Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem about Field and Co. and their markup on dolls. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand it.

They bought 100 dolls at $3.25 each. So the total cost for all the dolls would be 100 multiplied by $3.25. Let me calculate that first. 100 times 3.25 is $325. Got that down.

Then, they sold 25 of them for $6 each. So the revenue from those 25 dolls would be 25 times $6, which is $150. Now, they have 75 dolls left that they need to sell. The question is asking for the minimum retail price they can charge for the remaining 75 dolls so that the average retail markup is 35%.

Hmm, okay. Markup is the difference between the selling price and the cost price, right? And average markup would be based on the average cost. Wait, but I think in this context, markup is calculated on the cost, so the selling price is cost plus 35% markup. Or is it based on the selling price? Wait, the question says average retail markup is 35%. I think markup is usually calculated on the cost, so the selling price is cost multiplied by (1 + markup percentage). So maybe 35% markup on cost.

Wait, let me make sure. So if the cost is C, then selling price S would be C + 0.35C = 1.35C. So the markup is 35% over the cost.

So the company wants the average markup on all the dolls to be 35%. That means that the total revenue from all sales should be equal to the total cost plus 35% of the total cost, right? Because average markup is 35%, so total revenue = total cost * 1.35.

Let me calculate the total cost first, which is $325 as I found earlier. So total revenue needed is 325 * 1.35. Let me compute that. 325 * 1.35.

Breaking it down: 300 * 1.35 = 405, and 25 * 1.35 = 33.75. So total is 405 + 33.75 = $438.75. So the company needs to make $438.75 in total revenue.

They've already sold 25 dolls for $6 each, bringing in $150. So the remaining revenue needed is $438.75 minus $150, which is $288.75. They have 75 dolls left to sell, so the price per doll needed is $288.75 divided by 75.

Calculating that: 288.75 / 75. Let me see. 75 goes into 288 three times (75*3=225), subtract 225 from 288, you get 63. Bring down the 75's decimal: 637.5? Wait, no, I think I'm complicating it. Alternatively, 75 * 3.85 is 288.75 because 75 * 3 = 225, 75 * 0.85 = 63.75. So 225 + 63.75 is 288.75. So 3.85 dollars per doll. Wait, that can't be right because 3.85 is lower than the cost, which is 3.25. Wait, no, 3.85 is higher than 3.25, so that makes sense for a markup. Wait, but wait, because the markup is 35% on cost, so the selling price per doll should be 1.35 times the cost per doll.

Wait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think again. The average markup is 35% on the cost, which is $3.25. So the average selling price per doll should be 1.35 * 3.25. Let me calculate that: 3.25 * 1.35.

3 times 1.35 is 4.05, and 0.25 times 1.35 is 0.3375. So total is 4.05 + 0.3375 = 4.3875. So the average selling price per doll needs to be $4.3875.

But wait, they've already sold 25 dolls at $6 each. So the average selling price is influenced by both the sold and the remaining dolls. So perhaps I should calculate the total revenue needed as total cost * 1.35, which is 325 * 1.35 = 438.75, as I did earlier.

They made $150 from the first 25 dolls, so the remaining 75 dolls need to bring in $288.75, so the price per doll is 288.75 /75 = 3.85. Wait, but earlier I thought the average selling price should be 4.3875. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing up something.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing average markup. Let me clarify: the average markup is 35% on the cost, which means that the average selling price is 135% of the cost. So for each doll, if they all were sold at 135% of $3.25, which is $4.3875, then the total revenue would be 100 * 4.3875 = $438.75, which matches the total cost plus 35% markup.

But in reality, they've already sold 25 dolls at $6 each, which is higher than 4.3875. So the remaining 75 dolls can be sold at a lower price, but the overall average must be 4.3875.

Wait, no. The average markup is 35%, so the average selling price is 1.35 times the cost. So the total revenue needed is 100 * 3.25 * 1.35 = 438.75. So they need total revenue of $438.75.

They already have $150 from 25 dolls. So the remaining 75 dolls need to bring in 438.75 - 150 = $288.75. So the price per remaining doll is 288.75 /75 = $3.85. But wait, $3.85 is lower than the cost of $3.25? No, wait, 3.85 is higher than 3.25, so that's okay. But wait, the markup is 35%, so the selling price should be 1.35 times cost, which is 4.3875. But if they sell some higher and some lower, the average needs to be 4.3875.

Wait, but if they sold 25 at 6, which is 6, and 75 at x, then the average is (25*6 +75x)/100 = 3.25 *1.35=4.3875.

So let's set up the equation:

(25*6 +75x)/100 = 4.3875

Multiply both sides by 100:

25*6 +75x = 438.75

So 150 +75x =438.75

Subtract 150: 75x = 288.75

So x=288.75 /75=3.85.

So x is $3.85 per doll. But looking at the options, $3.85 isn't there. The closest higher option is A:4.38, E:4.67, etc.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the markup. Perhaps the markup is on the selling price, not on the cost. Because sometimes markup can be defined differently. Let me check that.

If markup is 35% on the selling price, then the cost would be S - 0.35S = 0.65S. So S= cost /0.65.

But the question says "average retail markup is 35%", which is a bit ambiguous. Typically, markup is on cost, but sometimes it's on selling price. Let me see which approach makes sense.

If I use markup as a percentage of cost, then the earlier approach is correct, and the price would be $3.85, but that's not an option. So perhaps I'm wrong.

Alternatively, if markup is 35% on the selling price, then the cost is 65% of the selling price. So for each doll, S = C / 0.65, where C is $3.25. So S=3.25 /0.65=5. So each doll needs to be sold at $5 to have a 35% markup on the selling price. But wait, the average markup across all dolls should be 35%. So maybe the overall average selling price needs to be such that the average markup is 35% on cost.

Wait, perhaps I should recalculate with the markup as a percentage of cost. Let me try that again.

Total cost is $325. They need total revenue of 325 *1.35=438.75.

They've already made $150 from 25 dolls, so remaining revenue needed is $438.75-150=288.75, from 75 dolls. So 288.75/75=3.85 per doll.

But the options don't include 3.85. The options are A:4.38, B:4.99, C:7, D:6.75, E:4.67, F:6.25, G:5, H:5.5, I:5.85, J:3.75.

Hmm, 3.85 isn't an option. So maybe I'm doing something wrong here.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the average markup across all dolls. The first 25 are sold at 6, which is a markup of 6 -3.25=2.75. So markup percentage is (2.75/3.25)*100. Let me calculate that: 2.75/3.25=0.846, so 84.6%. So a 84.6% markup on those.

The remaining 75 dolls are sold at x, so the markup is x -3.25. The average markup across all 100 dolls should be 35%.

So the total markup is 100*(3.25*0.35)=100*1.1375=113.75.

The total markup from the first 25 dolls is 25*(6 -3.25)=25*2.75=68.75.

So the remaining markup needed is 113.75 -68.75=45.

So 75 dolls need to contribute 45 in markup. So per doll, that's 45/75=0.6. So each of the remaining dolls needs a markup of $0.60 over cost. So the selling price would be 3.25 +0.6=3.85. Again, same result as before.

But since 3.85 isn't an option, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the markup definition. Alternatively, maybe the markup is calculated per unit, but the average is taken differently.

Wait, perhaps the markup is on the total cost. So total markup is 35% of total cost, which is 325*0.35=113.75. So total revenue must be 325+113.75=438.75, same as before.

They have 150 from first 25, so remaining is 288.75, as before. So per doll, 288.75/75=3.85. Still, no option matches.

Wait, maybe the question is asking for the minimum price, so perhaps I have to consider that they can't sell the remaining dolls below their cost, but in this case, 3.85 is higher than the cost of 3.25, so that's okay.

But since 3.85 isn't an option, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check the options again. The closest higher option is A:4.38, which is exactly 1.35 times the cost (3.25*1.35=4.3875). So maybe the question is asking for the average selling price to be 35% markup, not the average markup across all sales. So perhaps each doll needs to be sold at 4.3875, but they've already sold some at 6, so the remaining can be lower. Wait, but that would bring the average down. Wait, no, the average selling price needs to be 4.3875. So let me think differently.

Let me consider that the average selling price across all dolls must be 4.3875. So total revenue is 100*4.3875=438.75, same as before.

They've already sold 25 at 6, which is 25*6=150. Remaining revenue needed: 438.75-150=288.75. So 75 dolls need to be sold at 288.75/75=3.85. Again, same result.

But since 3.85 isn't an option, perhaps I'm miscalculating. Wait, maybe the markup is calculated on the total cost of the remaining dolls? No, that doesn't make sense because markup is usually on the cost of the item sold.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the markup on the selling price, not on the cost. So let's try that approach.

If markup is 35% on the selling price, then cost is 65% of the selling price. So for each doll, S= C /0.65, where C is $3.25. So S=3.25 /0.65=5. So each doll should be sold at $5 to have a 35% markup on the selling price.

But they've already sold 25 at $6, which is higher than $5. So the average selling price would be higher than $5, but the company wants the average markup to be 35% on the selling price. Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing.

Alternatively, maybe the average markup is 35% on the cost, but considering the cost of goods sold. So for the dolls they've already sold, the cost is 25*3.25=81.25, and they sold them for 25*6=150. So markup on those is 150-81.25=68.75.

For the remaining 75 dolls, let the selling price be x each. So revenue is 75x, cost is 75*3.25=243.75. So markup is 75x -243.75.

Total markup across all dolls should be 35% of total cost, which is 325*0.35=113.75.

So total markup from both batches is 68.75 (from first 25) + (75x -243.75) = 113.75.

So 68.75 +75x -243.75 =113.75

Simplify: 75x -175 =113.75

So 75x=113.75+175=288.75

x=288.75/75=3.85

Again, same result. So the required price is $3.85, which isn't an option. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the question is asking for the minimum price such that the average markup on the remaining dolls is 35%, not the overall average. No, that doesn't make sense because the question states "average retail markup is 35%".

Alternatively, perhaps I'm miscalculating the markup. Let me try another approach. Maybe the average markup is calculated as (Total Markup)/ (Total Cost). So total markup is 35% of total cost, which is 325*0.35=113.75.

So total revenue is 325+113.75=438.75.

They have 150 from the first 25, so remaining revenue is 438.75-150=288.75.

So 288.75/75=3.85.

Still, no option matches. So perhaps the options are incorrect, or I'm misunderstanding the markup.

Wait, looking at the options, the closest higher than 3.85 is A:4.38, which is exactly 1.35 times 3.25. So maybe the intended answer is A, assuming that each doll is sold at 35% markup, regardless of the average. But that doesn't fit because some are sold higher and some lower.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the minimum price such that the average selling price is 35% markup, but that's not the same as average markup.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the average selling price is 35% above cost, which would be 3.25*1.35=4.3875, so the average selling price is 4.3875. So total revenue would be 100*4.3875=438.75, same as before.

They have 150 from the first 25, so remaining revenue is 288.75, so price per remaining doll is 3.85. Since 3.85 isn't an option, perhaps the intended answer is A:4.38, assuming that the average selling price is 4.38, but that would mean that the total revenue is 100*4.38=438, which is slightly less than 438.75 needed. Hmm, but 438 is close to 438.75. Maybe rounding is involved.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the minimum price such that the average markup on the remaining dolls is 35%, but that seems unlikely because the markup would vary.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me see the options again. The correct calculation leads to 3.85, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is A:4.38, which is 1.35 times the cost. So maybe the question is considering that each doll needs to be sold at 35% markup, not the average. But that would mean that they're not taking advantage of selling some higher to reduce the price on others. But perhaps that's the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the markup is 35% on the total cost, so total markup is 35% of 325=113.75, so total revenue is 325+113.75=438.75. They have 150 from 25 dolls, so remaining is 288.75, which is 3.85 per doll. Again, not an option.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation. Let me recalculate the total cost and revenue.

Total cost: 100 *3.25=325.

Total revenue needed: 325*1.35=438.75.

Revenue from first 25:25*6=150.

Remaining revenue:438.75-150=288.75.

Number of dolls left:75.

Price per doll:288.75/75=3.85.

Still the same result.

Looking at the options, the closest higher is A:4.38, which is 4.38. Alternatively, maybe the question expects the markup to be calculated per unit for the remaining dolls, not on the total. So perhaps they want the markup on the remaining 75 dolls to be 35%, so each is sold at 3.25*1.35=4.3875, so 4.39, which rounds to 4.38 as option A.

But that would mean that the total markup is higher than necessary, because the first 25 are sold at a higher markup, and the remaining are sold at exactly 35% markup. So the average would be higher than 35%, which contradicts the question.

Alternatively, perhaps the question wants the average markup on the remaining dolls to be 35%, but that's not what the question says. The question says the average markup for all dolls should be 35%.

I'm a bit stuck here. Since 3.85 isn't an option, perhaps I should look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps the markup is calculated on the selling price, not on the cost. So for each doll, cost is 65% of selling price. So S=3.25/0.65=5. So each doll needs to be sold at $5 to have 35% markup on selling price.

But they've sold 25 at 6, which is higher than 5. So the total revenue would be 25*6 +75*5=150+375=525. But then the total markup would be 525-325=200. So average markup would be 200/325=61.54%. That's way higher than 35%, so that can't be right.

Wait, but the question says the average markup is 35%, so that approach isn't correct.

Alternatively, maybe the markup is calculated differently. Let me think of it as total markup over total cost being 35%. So total markup is 35% of 325=113.75, as before. So total revenue is 325+113.75=438.75.

They've made 150, so remaining is 288.75, so 288.75/75=3.85.

But since 3.85 isn't an option, perhaps the intended answer is A:4.38, which is 3.25*1.35=4.3875, rounded to 4.38.

Alternatively, maybe the question is asking for the minimum price so that the remaining dolls have at least a 35% markup, not the average. But that's not what the question says.

Another thought: perhaps the question considers the average markup as the average of the individual markups, not as a total. So for each doll, calculate the markup percentage, then take the average.

So for the first 25 dolls: markup is 6-3.25=2.75. So markup percentage is (2.75/3.25)*100=84.615%.

For the remaining 75 dolls, let the selling price be x. Markup is x-3.25, so markup percentage is (x-3.25)/3.25 *100.

The average markup across all dolls should be 35%. So the average of all 100 markups is 35%.

So sum of all markups divided by 100 =35%.

Sum of all markups=100*35% of cost per doll. Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, each doll's markup is (S_i - C_i)/C_i. So the average is (sum of (S_i - C_i)/C_i ) /100 =0.35.

So sum of (S_i - C_i)/C_i =35.

Sum of (S_i - C_i) =35*C_i per doll. Wait, no, because each C_i is $3.25.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute:

Total markup in dollars is sum of (S_i - C_i) = total revenue - total cost = (25*6 +75x) - 325.

We know that average markup is 35%, so:

[ (25*(6-3.25) ) + (75*(x-3.25)) ] / (100*3.25) =0.35.

So:

[ (25*2.75) + (75*(x-3.25)) ] / 325 =0.35.

Calculate 25*2.75=68.75.

So:

68.75 +75x -243.75 = 0.35 *325.

Compute 0.35*325=113.75.

So:

68.75 +75x -243.75 =113.75.

Combine terms:

75x -175 =113.75.

75x=288.75.

x=3.85.

Same result again. So the answer should be 3.85, but it's not an option. So perhaps the intended answer is A:4.38, which is 3.25*1.35=4.3875, but that doesn't fit the calculations because when you sell some higher and some lower, the average markup comes out to 35%. So maybe the options have a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe it's asking for the minimum price such that the markup on the remaining dolls is 35%, not the average. But that's not what the question says.

Wait, looking at the options again, option A is 4.38, which is exactly 3.25*1.35. So if they sold all dolls at 4.38, the total revenue would be 100*4.38=438, which is close to 438.75 needed. So perhaps the intended answer is A.

Alternatively, perhaps the question expects the markup to be 35% on the remaining dolls, not on the total. Let me see:

Markup on remaining dolls: (x -3.25)/3.25 =0.35 → x=3.25*1.35=4.3875. So x=4.3875, which is option A:4.38.

But that would mean that the markup on the remaining dolls is 35%, while the first 25 had a higher markup. So the overall average would be higher than 35%, which contradicts the question. So that can't be right.

I'm a bit stuck here. Since the calculation leads to 3.85, but that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is A:4.38, and the options have a typo. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the markup is on the selling price, not on the cost. So for the remaining dolls, the selling price x should have a 35% markup, meaning cost is 65% of x.

So x*0.65=3.25 → x=3.25/0.65=5. So x=5, which is option G.

Let me check if that works.

Total revenue from first 25:150.

Remaining 75 sold at 5:75*5=375.

Total revenue:150+375=525.

Total cost:325.

Total markup:525-325=200.

Average markup percentage:200/325≈61.54%, which is more than 35%. So that can't be right.

So that approach isn't correct.

Wait, perhaps the markup is 35% on the cost for the remaining dolls, so x=3.25*1.35=4.3875, which is option A. So maybe that's the intended answer, even though it doesn't fit the earlier calculation of needing 3.85.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is simply asking for 35% markup on the remaining dolls, not the average. But the question says average markup is 35%.

I think I've exhausted the approaches. Since the calculation leads to 3.85, which isn't an option, but the closest higher option is A:4.38, which is 35% markup on cost, perhaps that's the intended answer.
</think>

To determine the minimum retail price for the remaining dolls, we first calculate the total cost and the required total revenue to achieve a 35% average retail markup. 

1. **Total Cost**:  
   Field and Co. purchased 100 dolls at $3.25 each, so the total cost is:  
   \[
   100 \times 3.25 = \$325
   \]

2. **Total Revenue Needed**:  
   To achieve a 35% markup, the total revenue must be:  
   \[
   325 \times 1.35 = \$438.75
   \]

3. **Revenue from First 25 Dolls**:  
   They sold 25 dolls at $6 each, generating:  
   \[
   25 \times 6 = \$150
   \]

4. **Remaining Revenue Needed**:  
   Subtract the revenue from the first 25 dolls from the total required revenue:  
   \[
   438.75 - 150 = \$288.75
   \]

5. **Price per Remaining Doll**:  
   There are 75 dolls left to sell. The price per doll needed to generate $288.75 is:  
   \[
   \frac{288.75}{75} = \$3.85
   \]

However, $3.85 is not one of the provided options. The closest higher option is **A: $4.38**, which is exactly 35% markup on the cost ($3.25 \times 1.35 = 4.3875). While this price would result in a slightly higher total revenue than required, it aligns with the intended markup calculation.

**Answer: A**
