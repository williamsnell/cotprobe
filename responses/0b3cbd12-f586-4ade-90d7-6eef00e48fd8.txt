The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

A truck and a car collided at an intersection. Both drivers were injured, and each one filed a lawsuit against the other for negligence. At trial, the jury found each of the drivers liable for negligence. The jury found that the amount of the truck driver's injuries was $10,000, and the amount of the car driver's injuries was $8,000. The jury assigned 50 percent of the fault for the accident to the truck driver and 50 percent of the fault to the car driver. Assume that the jurisdiction has a statute in effect that provides: "Contributory negligence shall not bar recovery in an action to recover damages for negligence resulting in injury to person or property if such negligence was not as great as the negligence of the person from whom recovery is sought. Any damages allowed shall be diminished in proportion to the amount of negligence attributable to the person who is seeking recovery. "Which of the following is the appropriate judgment in the case?

Options:

A: The truck driver recovers $4,000, and the car driver recovers $2,000.
B: The truck driver recovers $2,000, and the car driver recovers $6,000.
C: The truck driver recovers $1,000, and the car driver recovers nothing.
D: The truck driver recovers nothing, and the car driver recovers $4,000.
E: The car driver recovers $5,000, and the truck driver recovers $5,000.
F: The truck driver recovers $5,000, and the car driver recovers $4,000.
G: The truck driver recovers $6,000, and the car driver recovers $2,000.
H: Neither party recovers anything from the other.
I: The truck driver recovers $10,000, and the car driver recovers $8,000.
J: The truck driver recovers $8,000, and the car driver recovers $10,000.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this legal problem. Let me read through it carefully.

So, there's a truck and a car that collided at an intersection. Both drivers were injured and each sued the other for negligence. At trial, the jury found both liable. The truck driver's injuries were $10,000, and the car driver's were $8,000. The jury assigned 50% fault to each.

The jurisdiction has a statute about contributory negligence. It says that contributory negligence doesn't bar recovery unless it's as great as the other's negligence. Then, any damages allowed are diminished in proportion to the negligence of the person seeking recovery.

Hmm, so I think this is a contributory negligence and comparative negligence issue. But wait, the statute says contributory negligence doesn't bar recovery unless it's as great. So maybe it's a modified comparative negligence system?

Wait, the statute says "Contributory negligence shall not bar recovery... if such negligence was not as great as the negligence of the person from whom recovery is sought." So, if your contributory negligence is not as great as the defendant's, you can recover, but your damages are reduced by your proportion of fault.

So, both drivers are each 50% at fault. So each is 50% contributorily negligent.

Now, applying this to each claim.

First, the truck driver is suing the car driver. The truck driver's damages are $10,000, and he was 50% at fault. So, his recovery from the car driver would be 50% of $10,000, which is $5,000. But wait, does the statute apply per claim or overall?

Wait, the statute says any damages allowed shall be diminished in proportion to the negligence of the person seeking recovery. So if the truck driver is 50% at fault, his recovery is reduced by 50%. So $10,000 * 50% = $5,000.

Similarly, the car driver's claim against the truck driver: his damages are $8,000, and he's 50% at fault. So his recovery would be $8,000 * 50% = $4,000.

So each would recover half of their own damages from the other. So the truck driver would get $5,000 from the car driver, and the car driver would get $4,000 from the truck driver.

Looking at the options:

Option F says truck driver recovers $5,000 and car driver recovers $4,000. That matches.

Wait, but let me double-check. The statute says "diminished in proportion to the amount of negligence attributable to the person who is seeking recovery." So each person's recovery is reduced by their own proportion of fault.

So yes, for each claim, the plaintiff recovers their total damages multiplied by (100% - their fault percentage).

So in each case, it's 50% fault, so 50% reduction. So truck driver's $10k becomes $5k, car driver's $8k becomes $4k.

So the correct judgment is each recovers half from the other. So option F.

The appropriate judgment is that the truck driver recovers $5,000 from the car driver, and the car driver recovers $4,000 from the truck driver. This is based on the jurisdiction's statute, which allows recovery as long as the contributory negligence is not as great as the other party's. Since both are equally at fault (50%), each recovers half of their respective damages. 

Answer: F
