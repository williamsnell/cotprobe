Okay, so I have this question about how radioactive isotopes are used in biological research, specifically for tracing the pathways of compounds in living cells. Hmm, I remember from my biology class that isotopes can be used as tracers because they can be easily detected. So the idea is that if you label a compound with a radioactive isotope, you can follow where it goes in the organism or cell.

Let me look at the options. Option A says it's a powerful method for studying metabolic pathways and other areas. That sounds familiar. I think this is right because I remember learning about experiments where they fed plants with water containing radioactive oxygen to see where the oxygen went in photosynthesis. So that's using isotopes to trace pathways.

Option B talks about improving food flavor and texture. I don't think that's right; radioactive isotopes aren't used for that. They might be used in food safety, but improving flavor doesn't ring a bell.

Option C mentions stimulating the immune system. I'm not sure about that. I think that's more about vaccines or other immunostimulants, not isotopes.

Option D says increasing oxygen-carrying capacity of blood. That doesn't seem related. Maybe something with iron in blood, but isotopes don't directly do that.

Option E is about enhancing crop growth. I think that might be more about fertilizers or chemicals, not isotopes. Plus, using isotopes for growth doesn't sound right.

Option F suggests using isotopes as a nutrient supplement. Wait, some isotopes are essential, like potassium or iron, but using them as supplements in animal diets for tracing? I don't think that's the main use here. The question is about tracing pathways, not supplementation.

Option G says they're used for glow-in-the-dark materials. Oh, that's more about things like luminous dials or maybe some scientific equipment, but not directly related to biological research in this context.

Option H is about providing energy for spacecrafts. That's about radioisotope thermoelectric generators, which are used for power in space. But that's a different application, not biological research.

Option I mentions killing cancer cells. That's radiation therapy, which uses isotopes, but that's treatment, not tracing in cells.

Option J is about dating archaeological samples, which is carbon-14 dating. But that's about determining age, not tracking biological pathways.

So the correct answer must be A. It directly mentions metabolic pathways and other biological uses, which aligns with the question. The other options don't fit the context of tracing compounds in living cells.

The correct answer is A. Radioactive isotopes are used to label substances, allowing researchers to track their movement and interactions within living cells and organisms. This method is particularly useful for studying metabolic pathways and other biological processes.
