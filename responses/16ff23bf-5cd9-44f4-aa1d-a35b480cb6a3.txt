Okay, so I've got this problem here about determining the density of blood using a mixture of xylene and bromobenzene. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, the problem says that drops of blood are placed in a mixture of xylene and bromobenzene. The mixture is adjusted until the drops neither rise nor sink. That means the density of the blood must be equal to the density of the mixture, right? Because if the blood's density were higher, it would sink, and if it were lower, it would float. So, when they balance, they're the same density.

The mixture is 72% xylene by volume and 28% bromobenzene by volume. I think I need to calculate the density of this mixture and that will give me the density of the blood.

Wait, but how do I find the density when two liquids are mixed by volume? Oh right, I remember that when mixing liquids by volume, the total volume is the sum of the parts, and the mass is the sum of each component's mass. So, I can calculate the mass contributed by each liquid and then divide by the total volume to get the density.

Let me write down the given densities:
- Xylene density (ρ_xylene) = 0.867 g/cm³
- Bromobenzene density (ρ_bromo) = 1.497 g/cm³

The mixture is 72% xylene and 28% bromobenzene by volume. Let's assume we have 100 cm³ of mixture for simplicity. That makes calculations easier because percentages will directly translate to volumes.

So, volume of xylene = 72 cm³
Volume of bromobenzene = 28 cm³

Now, the mass of each component is density multiplied by volume.

Mass of xylene = 0.867 g/cm³ * 72 cm³ = let's calculate that. 0.867 * 70 is 60.69, and 0.867 * 2 is 1.734, so total is 60.69 + 1.734 = 62.424 g.

Mass of bromobenzene = 1.497 g/cm³ * 28 cm³. Hmm, 1.497 * 28. Let me break it down: 1.497 * 20 = 29.94, and 1.497 * 8 = 11.976. Adding those gives 29.94 + 11.976 = 41.916 g.

Total mass of the mixture is 62.424 g + 41.916 g = 104.34 g.

Total volume is 100 cm³, so the density of the mixture is total mass divided by total volume. That would be 104.34 g / 100 cm³ = 1.0434 g/cm³.

So the density of the blood must be 1.0434 g/cm³. Looking at the options, that's option F.

The density of the blood is equal to the density of the mixture when the drops neither rise nor sink. By calculating the mass of each component and dividing by the total volume, the mixture's density is found to be 1.0434 g/cm³.
