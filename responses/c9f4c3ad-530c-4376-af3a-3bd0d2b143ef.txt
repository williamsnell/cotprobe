Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure out how the water level in the dock changes when the barge sinks after loading. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I'll read the problem carefully. There's a barge with a mass of 15,000 kg made from metal with a density of 7500 kg/m³. It's being loaded in a closed dock with a surface area of 6633 m². They load 80,000 kg of ore, which has a density of 3 g/cm³. When this ore is loaded, the barge sinks, and I need to find out how the water level in the dock changes. The area of the barge is negligible compared to the dock's area.

Hmm. So, the key here is probably buoyancy and displacement. When the barge sinks, it displaces a volume of water equal to the total weight of the barge and the ore. Because the barge is sinking, it must mean that the displaced water's weight equals the combined weight of the barge and the ore.

Wait, no. When a floating object sinks, it's because the weight exceeds the buoyant force. But once it's submerged, the buoyant force would be equal to the weight of the displaced water. So, when the barge sinks, it's fully submerged, and the displaced water volume is equal to the total mass of the barge and ore divided by the density of water.

Wait, but the barge itself is made of metal. Let me think: The barge's own weight is 15,000 kg, and the ore adds 80,000 kg, so the total mass is 95,000 kg. The density of water is 1000 kg/m³. So the volume of water displaced should be the total mass divided by the density of water. That would be 95,000 kg / 1000 kg/m³ = 95 m³.

Now, the dock has a surface area, which I think is the area over which the water level will rise. The problem states the dock's surface area is 6633 m². So the rise in water level would be the displaced volume divided by the dock's area.

So, rise in water level h = Volume / Area = 95 m³ / 6633 m². Let me calculate that.

First, 95 divided by 6633. Let me do the division: 95 ÷ 6633 ≈ 0.0143 meters. To convert that to centimeters, I multiply by 100, so that's about 1.43 cm. Hmm, but looking at the options, the closest is F:1.5 cm or H:1 cm. Wait, but maybe I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, no. Because the barge's own density is given as 7500 kg/m³, which is higher than water's 1000 kg/m³. So when the barge is empty, it's already submerged? No, wait, barges float when empty. Wait, no, wait: The barge's own mass is 15,000 kg, and its volume would be mass divided by density. So the volume of the barge is 15,000 kg / 7500 kg/m³ = 2 m³. So when the barge is empty, the displaced water is equal to the barge's volume, which is 2 m³. The weight of that displaced water is 2 m³ * 1000 kg/m³ = 2000 kg. But the barge's own mass is 15,000 kg, which is way more than 2000 kg. That can't be right because then the barge would sink even when empty. But the problem says it's being loaded, so the initial state must be that it's floating. So maybe I'm misunderstanding the setup.

Wait, perhaps the barge is designed to float when empty, but when loaded with 80,000 kg of ore, it sinks. So the total mass when loaded is 15,000 + 80,000 = 95,000 kg, as I thought earlier. Since it's sinking, the entire volume of the barge plus the submerged part must equal the volume displaced.

Wait, no. When the barge sinks, it's fully submerged. So the volume displaced is equal to the total volume of the barge plus any additional volume from the ore? No, the ore is on the barge, so when the barge sinks, the entire volume of the barge (which is 2 m³) plus any submerged part of the ore? Wait, no, the ore is in the barge, so the total mass is 95,000 kg, which would displace 95 m³ of water, as I calculated earlier.

But wait, the barge's own volume is 2 m³. So when the barge is loaded with 80,000 kg of ore, the total mass is 95,000 kg. If the barge sinks, it displaces 95 m³ of water. The volume of the barge itself is 2 m³, so the remaining displaced volume must come from the water that was already in the dock. No, wait, the dock is closed, so maybe the water level rises by the volume of the displaced water beyond what's already there.

Wait, perhaps I should model this differently. The barge, when loaded, has a total mass of 95,000 kg. Since it sinks, it displaces a volume V = mass / density_water = 95,000 / 1000 = 95 m³.

But the barge's own volume is 2 m³ (from 15,000 kg / 7500 kg/m³). So the additional displacement comes from the submerged part of the dock's water. Wait, no. The dock's water level rises because the barge is displacing more water than before.

Wait, when the barge is empty, it's floating, displacing V1 = m_barge / density_water = 15,000 / 1000 = 15 m³. So the initial water displaced is 15 m³, causing a rise in water level h_initial = V1 / A_dock = 15 / 6633 ≈ 0.00226 m = 0.226 cm.

When the barge is loaded with 80,000 kg of ore, the total mass is 95,000 kg, and since it sinks, it displaces V2 = 95,000 / 1000 = 95 m³. So the new water level is h_new = V2 / A_dock = 95 / 6633 ≈ 0.0143 m = 1.43 cm.

So the change in water level is h_new - h_initial = 1.43 cm - 0.226 cm ≈ 1.204 cm. Wait, but that's not matching any of the options. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Because when the barge is empty, it's displacing 15 m³, which would cause a rise in the dock. Then when it's loaded, it's displacing 95 m³, so the total rise is 95 m³, but the initial rise was already 15 m³. So the change in water level would be (95 - 15) m³ / 6633 m² = 80 m³ / 6633 m² ≈ 0.01206 m = 1.206 cm. Again, about 1.2 cm, which isn't an option exactly, but the closest option is F: 1.5 cm or H:1 cm.

Wait, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the initial water level is zero, and the dock is filled with water. No, the problem says it's a closed dock, so I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the initial water level is such that the barge is floating, and when it sinks, the water level rises by the volume of the barge plus the ore, but I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider only the displacement caused by the loaded barge. Since the barge sinks, it displaces 95 m³, and the area of the dock is 6633 m², so the rise is 95 / 6633 ≈ 0.0143 m = 1.43 cm, which rounds to about 1.4 cm. The closest option is F:1.5 cm.

Wait, but looking at the options, E is 0.8 cm, which is half of that. Did I make a mistake in units? Let me check the ore's density. The ore is 3 g/cm³. Wait, 3 g/cm³ is 3000 kg/m³. So that's correct. The mass of the ore is 80,000 kg, which is 80,000 kg. So the total mass is 15,000 + 80,000 = 95,000 kg, correct.

Wait, but maybe the barge's own volume isn't 2 m³. Let me recalculate: barge mass is 15,000 kg, density 7500 kg/m³, so volume is 15,000 /7500 = 2 m³. Correct.

So the displaced water when fully submerged is 95 m³. So the rise is 95 / 6633 ≈ 0.0143 m, which is 1.43 cm. So the options don't have 1.4 cm, but F is 1.5 cm, which is close. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the barge's volume is negligible compared to the dock's area, as stated, so the rise is simply 95 m³ / 6633 m² = ~1.43 cm. So the answer would be approximately 1.4 cm, but since that's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, let me double-check. The barge sinks, so the displaced volume is the total mass of the barge and ore divided by the density of water. So 95,000 kg / 1000 kg/m³ = 95 m³. The dock area is 6633 m², so the rise is 95 / 6633 = 0.0143 m = 1.43 cm. So the closest option is F:1.5 cm.

Wait, but the options don't have 1.4 cm, only 1.5 cm. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that when the barge is loaded, the water level rises by the volume of the barge's displacement beyond the initial state. Wait, but if the barge was initially floating, it displaced 15 m³, and when it sinks, it displaces 95 m³, so the change is 80 m³. So 80 / 6633 ≈ 0.01206 m = 1.206 cm. Hmm, closer to 1.2 cm, but that's not an option either.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that when the barge is loaded, the total displacement is 95 m³, regardless of the initial state. So the rise is 95 m³ / 6633 m² ≈ 1.43 cm, which rounds to 1.4 cm. Since 1.4 isn't an option, the closest is F:1.5 cm.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute 95 divided by 6633 more accurately.

95 ÷ 6633 = let's see. 6633 × 0.014 = 6633 * 0.01 = 66.33, 6633 *0.004=26.532, total 92.862. So 0.014 gives 92.862, which is less than 95. The difference is 95 -92.862=2.138. So 2.138 /6633 ≈0.000322. So total h ≈0.014322 meters, which is 1.4322 cm, so 1.43 cm. So the closest option is F:1.5 cm.

Wait, but another approach: perhaps the barge's own volume is 2 m³, and when it's loaded, the total mass is 95,000 kg, so the submerged volume is 95 m³. But the barge's own volume is 2 m³, so the additional volume from the ore is 95 -2 =93 m³. But that doesn't make sense because the ore is on the barge, not displacing separately.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the water displaced when the barge is loaded: the total displaced volume is 95 m³, so the rise is 95 m³ / 6633 m² ≈1.43 cm.

So the answer should be approximately 1.4 cm, but the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Maybe the water level rises by the volume of the ore divided by the dock's area. Wait, no, because the ore is on the barge, which is displacing water. So the entire mass of the barge and ore contributes to the displaced water.

Alternatively, perhaps the barge's own displacement is 15 m³ when empty, and when loaded, the total displacement is 95 m³, so the change is 80 m³, leading to a rise of 80 /6633 ≈0.01206 m =1.206 cm. That's about 1.2 cm, but that's not an option either.

Wait, perhaps I should ignore the initial displacement and just calculate the rise due to the loaded barge. So 95 m³ /6633 m² = ~1.43 cm. So the answer would be F:1.5 cm.

But another thought: the ore's density is 3 g/cm³, which is 3000 kg/m³. So the volume of the ore is 80,000 kg /3000 kg/m³ = 26.666... m³. So when the ore is loaded into the barge, the barge's total mass is 15,000 +80,000=95,000 kg. The barge's own volume is 2 m³, so when it's loaded, the total displaced volume is 95,000 kg /1000 kg/m³=95 m³. So the rise is 95 m³ /6633 m²≈1.43 cm.

So the answer is approximately 1.4 cm, which rounds to 1.5 cm, so option F.

To determine how the water level in the dock changes when the barge sinks after loading, we analyze the buoyancy and displacement principles. The barge has a mass of 15,000 kg, and the ore loaded onto it adds 80,000 kg, resulting in a total mass of 95,000 kg. When the barge sinks, it fully submerges, displacing a volume of water equal to its total mass divided by the density of water:

\[
V_{\text{displaced}} = \frac{95,000 \, \text{kg}}{1000 \, \text{kg/m}^3} = 95 \, \text{m}^3.
\]

The dock has a surface area of 6633 m². The rise in water level is calculated by dividing the displaced volume by the dock's area:

\[
h = \frac{V_{\text{displaced}}}{\text{Area}_{\text{dock}}} = \frac{95 \, \text{m}^3}{6633 \, \text{m}^2} \approx 0.0143 \, \text{m} = 1.43 \, \text{cm}.
\]

Among the given options, the closest value to 1.43 cm is **1.5 cm**. Thus, the water level in the dock rises by approximately **1.5 cm**.
