Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this economics problem about average fixed costs for a shoe manufacturer. Let me break it down step by step.

Alright, the question says that the manufacturer has an average fixed cost of $0.50 per shoe when producing 10,000 shoes. Fixed costs are those that don't change with the level of production, like rent or machinery. So, if the average fixed cost is $0.50 at 10,000 shoes, I can find the total fixed cost by multiplying the average by the number of shoes.

Total fixed cost = average fixed cost × quantity. So that's $0.50 × 10,000. Let me do the math: 0.5 times 10,000 is $5,000. Okay, so the total fixed cost is $5,000 regardless of how many shoes they produce.

Now, the question asks what happens to the average fixed cost if production expands to 12,500 shoes. Since fixed costs don't change, the total fixed cost remains $5,000. But now, the same $5,000 is spread over more shoes, which means the average fixed cost per shoe should decrease.

To find the new average fixed cost, I divide the total fixed cost by the new quantity. So that's $5,000 ÷ 12,500. Let me calculate that. 5,000 divided by 12,500... Hmm, 12,500 is 1.25 times 10,000. So 5,000 divided by 12,500 is the same as 5,000 divided by (1.25 × 10,000). Which simplifies to (5,000 ÷ 10,000) ÷ 1.25. That's 0.5 ÷ 1.25.

Wait, 0.5 divided by 1.25. Let me think: 1.25 times 0.4 is 0.5, right? Because 1.25 × 0.4 = 0.5. So 0.5 ÷ 1.25 equals 0.4. So the new average fixed cost is $0.40 per shoe.

Looking at the options, D is $0.40. So the answer should be D.

The average fixed cost is calculated by dividing total fixed costs by the quantity of output. Initially, at 10,000 shoes, the average fixed cost is $0.50, so total fixed costs are $5,000. When production increases to 12,500 shoes, the average fixed cost decreases because the same total fixed cost is spread over more units. Calculating, $5,000 ÷ 12,500 equals $0.40 per shoe. 

Answer: D
