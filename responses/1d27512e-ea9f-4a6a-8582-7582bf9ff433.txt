Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure out the maximum number of students who only answered one question. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the problem says there are 30 students from 5 classes. Each student solved at least one math problem, and there are 40 problems in total. So, every student has answered at least one, but some might have answered more.

Now, the key points are:

1. Every two students in the same class solved the same number of questions. So, within a class, all students have the same number of correct answers. That means each class has a uniform number of correct answers for all its students.

2. Any two students from different classes have different numbers of correct answers. So, if I take a student from class A and another from class B, their correct answer counts must be different. This implies that each class has a unique number of correct answers, and each class's number is different from the others.

The question is asking for the maximum possible number of students who only answered one question. So, I need to maximize the number of students with exactly one correct answer, given the constraints.

Let me think about how to approach this. Since each class has the same number of correct answers for all students, and each class's number is unique, the number of correct answers per class must be distinct integers. Let's denote these numbers as k1, k2, k3, k4, k5, where each ki is a unique positive integer because each student answers at least one question.

Our goal is to maximize the number of students with ki=1. Let's assume that as many classes as possible have ki=1. But wait, no, because each class's ki must be unique. So, if one class has ki=1, another must have a different number, say ki=2, and so on.

But wait, the problem states that each student must answer at least one question, so each ki must be at least 1. Also, since each class's ki is unique, the possible ki's are distinct integers starting from 1 upwards.

Now, let's think about how many students can be in each class. Let's say we have class sizes n1, n2, n3, n4, n5, where n1 + n2 + n3 + n4 + n5 = 30. Each class's ki is unique, so the possible ki's are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, etc., but we need to choose 5 distinct integers.

But wait, the total number of correct answers across all students is 40. So, the sum of (ki * ni) for each class must equal 40. Our goal is to maximize the number of students with ki=1, which would be n1 (if k1=1), plus possibly others if their ki=1, but no, because each class's ki must be unique. So, only one class can have ki=1, another can have ki=2, and so on.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Because each class's ki must be unique, so if I have five classes, their ki's must be five distinct positive integers. So, the smallest possible ki's are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Let's check if that's possible.

Let me assign the smallest possible ki's to the classes to see if I can maximize the number of students with ki=1. So, let's say:

k1 = 1 (so all students in class 1 answered 1 question)
k2 = 2
k3 = 3
k4 = 4
k5 = 5

Now, the total correct answers would be sum(ki * ni) = 1*n1 + 2*n2 + 3*n3 + 4*n4 +5*n5 = 40.

We also have n1 + n2 +n3 +n4 +n5=30.

Our goal is to maximize n1, since that's the number of students who answered exactly one question.

So, to maximize n1, we need to minimize the sum of the other terms (2n2 +3n3 +4n4 +5n5) while ensuring that all ni are positive integers and sum up with n1 to 30.

Wait, but all classes must have at least one student, right? Because there are 5 classes, each contributing to the total. So, each ni >=1.

So, let's set n2, n3, n4, n5 to their minimum possible values, which is 1 each. Then n1 =30 - (1+1+1+1) = 26.

So, n1=26, n2=1, n3=1, n4=1, n5=1.

Now, let's check the total correct answers:

1*26 + 2*1 +3*1 +4*1 +5*1 = 26 +2+3+4+5=40.

That adds up perfectly to 40. So in this case, 26 students answered exactly one question, and the remaining 4 classes have 1 student each with 2,3,4,5 correct answers respectively.

Wait, but is that possible? Because the problem says each student must answer at least one question, which is satisfied here. Each class has the same number of correct answers, which is 1,2,3,4,5 respectively, so that's unique across classes. And the total correct answers sum to 40.

So, this seems to fit all the constraints. Therefore, the maximum possible number of students who answered exactly one question is 26, which is option E.

The maximum number of students who only answered one question is 26, achieved by assigning one class to have 26 students answering 1 question each and the other four classes to have 1 student each answering 2, 3, 4, and 5 questions respectively, which sums up to 40 correct answers.

Answer: E
