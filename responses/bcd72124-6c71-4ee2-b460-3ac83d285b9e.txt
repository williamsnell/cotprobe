Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about Singer's theory. I'm a bit rusty on my ethics, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question is asking about an objection that Singer himself considers. The options are A to J. I remember that Peter Singer is known for his work in ethics, particularly his utilitarian approach. He's famous for arguing that we should help those in the greatest need, regardless of where they are, which sometimes leads to controversial positions.

Let me look at each option:

A: inappropriately makes proximity morally important.
Hmm, I think proximity might be a factor in some ethical theories, but Singer's approach emphasizes the consequences and the number of people affected. So he probably argues against making proximity too important. But wait, is this an objection he considers? Or does he actually say proximity doesn't matter? I'm not sure yet.

B: fails to consider the cultural differences in moral norms.
Singer's a universalist, I believe. He thinks moral standards are objective, not culturally relative. So maybe this is an objection he addresses, but I'm not certain if it's a primary one or if he considers it at all.

C: overlooks the role of government and institutions in addressing suffering.
I don't recall Singer focusing much on governments in his objections. His work tends to be more individual-focused, like what you can do personally. So perhaps this isn't the objection he considers.

D: does not do enough to address suffering in other countries besides our own.
Wait, that sounds a bit off. Singer's famous for arguing we should help globally, like his argument against the "drowning child" scenario. So maybe this isn't an objection he faces, but rather a point he makes.

E: does not account for the fact that we have stricter obligations to our loved ones than to strangers.
This rings a bell. I think Singer addresses this. He might say that our obligations to loved ones are stronger because we have a relationship, but in terms of suffering, we should still help where we can do the most good. So this could be an objection he considers.

F: does not address the issue of moral obligations to non-human animals.
Singer is known for his work on animal ethics, like "Animal Liberation." So he definitely addresses this, so F is probably not the correct answer.

G: ignores the importance of self-interest in human behavior.
Singer's theory is more about altruism, I think. He might not ignore self-interest, but he doesn't prioritize it over the greater good. I'm not sure if this is a major objection he considers.

H: assumes that all individuals have the same capacity to alleviate suffering.
This seems plausible. Maybe some people can do more than others, so if Singer assumes everyone can contribute equally, that's a flaw. I think he might address this, but I'm not certain.

I: does not provide a clear definition of what constitutes suffering.
That's a good point. Many ethical theories struggle with defining suffering. I think Singer talks about it, but perhaps it's an objection he considers.

J: requires too drastic a revision to our moral scheme.
Singer's ideas are pretty radical, so this is a common criticism. He might acknowledge that his theory changes traditional views, but is this an objection he considers?

Now, the question is which objection he considers. I think one of the main criticisms of Singer's approach is that he doesn't account for our stronger obligations to those close to us. For example, people might feel more obligated to help their family than strangers, but Singer's utilitarian approach might suggest we should help wherever the need is greatest. So option E seems likely.

Another point: Singer's theory can be seen as too demanding because it requires us to give up a lot to help others. But that's more about the practicality, which might relate to option J (drastic revision). But the question is about an objection he considers.

Wait, in his "Famine, Affluence, and Morality" essay, Singer argues against the idea that we have special obligations to our own countrymen or loved ones when it comes to saving lives. He says the obligation is based on ability to help, not proximity or relationship. So the objection that we have stricter obligations to loved ones is one he addresses, making E the correct answer.

The objection that Singer considers is that his theory does not account for the fact that we have stricter obligations to our loved ones than to strangers. This is addressed in his work, where he argues that our obligations should be based on the ability to help and the greatest good, rather than proximity or relationship.

Answer: E
