Okay, so I've got this question about passive personality jurisdiction, and I'm trying to figure out what it means. I'm not super familiar with legal terms, but I'll try to break it down.

First, I remember that jurisdiction refers to the authority of a court to hear and decide a case. There are different bases for jurisdiction, like where the crime was committed, the nationality of the parties involved, etc. Passive personality jurisdiction sounds like it's a type of jurisdiction that's based on the characteristics of the person involved, maybe the victim or the offender.

Looking at the options:

A: Registered country of the legal person. That sounds more like where a company is registered, maybe for corporate law, not specifically about jurisdiction over crimes.

B: Nationality of the offender. So if the offender is a citizen of a country, that country's courts can claim jurisdiction. I think this is called active personality jurisdiction because the country is asserting jurisdiction based on the person's link to it.

C: Relationship between victim and offender. Not sure about this one. I don't recall a specific jurisdiction based on their relationship, maybe something else like forum shopping?

D: Nationality of the victims. Hmm, so if the victims are from a particular country, that country's courts might have jurisdiction. That rings a bell because I think passive personality jurisdiction is when the state where the victim is a national exercises jurisdiction. So this might be the correct one.

E: Severity of the offence. I don't think the severity affects the jurisdiction basis; it's more about the punishment or which court handles it within a system.

F: Where the crime was planned. That might relate to jurisdiction over the planning, but I'm not sure if it's a recognized basis like passive or active personality.

G: International law applicable. That seems more about the law applied rather than the jurisdiction basis.

H: Residence of the offender. That's more like territorial jurisdiction if the person resides there, but passive personality is about the victim's nationality, I think.

I: Where the offence was committed. That's the classic territorial jurisdiction, where the crime happened.

J: Nationality of the witness. Witnesses' nationalities don't usually determine jurisdiction, unless maybe for their protection, but I don't think so.

So, putting it together. Passive personality jurisdiction is when a country asserts jurisdiction based on the nationality of the victims. That would be option D. Active personality is based on the offender's nationality, which is option B. The question is about passive, so D makes sense.

The correct answer is D: It is jurisdiction based on the nationality of the victims.
