Alright, so I've got this question about famous baseball figures and one of them was acquitted at a court-martial for insubordination. Hmm, I'm not super familiar with all the details of each player's history, but I'll try to think it through.

First, let's break down the question. Court-martial is a military trial, so the person in question must have had some military involvement. The charge was insubordination, which means they didn't obey orders. Being acquitted means they were found not guilty, so maybe there was some controversy or misunderstanding.

Looking at the options:

A: Babe Ruth – He was a huge star, but I don't recall him being in the military much. He was known more for his baseball career and personal life, maybe drinking and parties, but not sure about military court.

B: Ty Cobb – He had a reputation for being aggressive and having a temper, but I'm not sure about military court-martial. He might have had some legal issues, but I think they were off the field, not military.

C: Hank Aaron – He was a great player, Hall of Famer, but I don't think he had any military trials. He was more known for breaking records, especially Babe Ruth's home run record.

D: Willie Mays – Another legend, but I don't remember any military court issues. He was a great player, but his story doesn't ring a bell with court-martial.

E: Joe DiMaggio – The Yankee Clipper, he was a star, but again, I don't think he had any military legal troubles. He was more known for his career and his wife, Marilyn Monroe.

F: Abner Doubleday – Wait, wasn't he the guy credited with inventing baseball? I think he was a Union general during the Civil War. But does he have a court-martial record? Maybe, but I'm not certain. If he was a general, perhaps he had some disciplinary actions, but was he acquitted for insubordination?

G: Ted Williams – He was a Hall of Famer and also had a military career, I believe. He was in the military, maybe during World War II or Korea. I think he had some issues, but insubordination? Maybe, but I'm not sure.

H: Jackie Robinson – He was the first African American in the MLB, but he was also in the military. I remember he was court-martialed for refusing to move to the back of a bus, which was a civil rights issue. But he was acquitted because the rules didn't allow segregation in the military. So that could be the one. Wait, but the question says "insubordination," which is more about not following orders, not necessarily about civil rights.

I: Billy Martin – He was a player and later a manager. He was known for being fiery and had a reputation for being difficult. But I don't think he had any military court-martial. His issues were more on the baseball field and with owners.

J: Mickey Mantle – The Mick was a great player, but I don't recall any military court issues. His problems were more with drinking and personal issues, not insubordination in the military.

Wait, going back to F: Abner Doubleday. He was a general, so maybe he faced some charges. But I'm not sure about the specifics. Alternatively, H: Jackie Robinson was court-martialed for refusing to obey an order regarding segregation, which was about insubordination in a way, but more about civil rights. He was acquitted because the military didn't allow segregation. So that might fit.

Alternatively, I think Billy Martin had some issues, but not in the military. Maybe he had a court-martial in baseball terms, like being suspended, but not a military one.

So, the options are between F and H. Which one was acquitted for insubordination?

I think Jackie Robinson was indeed court-martialed during his military service. He was a second lieutenant in the Army during World War II. The incident happened when he refused to move to the back of a bus, which was a segregated practice. He was charged with insubordination, but the charges were dropped because the military didn't allow segregation. So he was acquitted.

Therefore, the answer should be H: Jackie Robinson.

The answer is H: Jackie Robinson.
