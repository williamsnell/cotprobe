Okay, so I've got this accounting question here about acquisition costs related to purchasing net assets. Let me try to break it down. The question says Bale Co. incurred $100,000 in acquisition costs when buying Dixon Co.'s net assets. The options are about how to treat these costs.

Hmm, I remember that in accounting, when a company acquires another company, the costs involved can be classified in different ways. I think there's a distinction between costs that are part of the acquisition and those that are just regular expenses.

Wait, what's the rule again? Oh right, I think that the costs to acquire a business—like legal fees, appraisals, and other direct costs—are considered part of the acquisition cost. But wait, no, actually, I'm a bit confused. I remember that the initial costs to acquire a company are part of the purchase price and are capitalized as part of the investment. But wait, no, that's only for business combinations. 

Wait, the company here is purchasing the net assets of another company. So is this a business combination or just an asset purchase? If it's a business combination, then the costs are part of the purchase price and might be treated as goodwill. But if it's just acquiring individual assets, then maybe the costs are expensed.

Wait, but I think that when you acquire a company's net assets, the costs are generally expensed as incurred. Or are they capitalized? I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Let me think about the accounting standards. I recall that in some cases, certain costs are expensed, while others are capitalized. For example, under IFRS, some acquisition costs are capitalized, but under US GAAP, it's different.

Wait, under US GAAP, when you acquire a business, the costs like finder's fees, legal fees, etc., are considered part of the cost of the acquisition and are expensed as incurred. Or wait, no, maybe they're part of the initial investment cost and could be capitalized as part of the intangible assets. Hmm, maybe not.

Alternatively, I think that in the context of purchase accounting, the acquisition costs are part of the purchase price, but I'm not sure if they're expensed or capitalized. Wait, no, the purchase price includes the cost of the net assets, and any additional costs are expensed.

Wait, another angle: when you buy net assets, the cost is considered an expense. So the $100,000 would be expensed in the period they're incurred. Because these are costs related to the acquisition process, not part of the value of the assets acquired. So they should be expensed as incurred.

Looking at the options, the options I should consider are I and D. Option I says "Expensed as incurred in the current period." Option D is "Expensed over the next five years." Which is it?

Wait, I think acquisition costs are expensed as incurred, not over multiple periods. So the correct option would be I, expensed in the current period.

Wait, but another thought: sometimes, certain costs like due diligence might be expensed when incurred, while others like legal fees for the acquisition could be capitalized. But I'm not sure. Wait, no, I think in general, under US GAAP, these costs are expensed as incurred. So the answer should be I.

The $100,000 in acquisition costs incurred by Bale Co. should be expensed as incurred in the current period, as these costs are related to the acquisition process and are not capitalized as part of the net assets acquired.

Answer: I
