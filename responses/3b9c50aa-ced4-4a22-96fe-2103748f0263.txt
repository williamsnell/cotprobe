Okay, so I have this probability problem here where I need to find the probability that the product of two numbers, a and b, is positive. The ranges given are -3 ≤ a ≤ 1 and -2 ≤ b ≤ 4. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that the product of two numbers is positive if both are positive or both are negative. So, I need to find the areas where a and b are both positive or both negative, and then divide that by the total area of all possible (a,b) pairs. That should give me the probability.

Let me sketch this out in my mind. The possible values of a and b can be represented as a rectangle on a coordinate plane, with a on the x-axis from -3 to 1, and b on the y-axis from -2 to 4. So the total area is the product of the lengths of these intervals.

Calculating the total area: The length for a is 1 - (-3) = 4 units, and for b, it's 4 - (-2) = 6 units. So total area is 4 * 6 = 24 square units. That's my denominator.

Now, I need the areas where a*b is positive. That happens in two cases:

1. Both a and b are positive.
2. Both a and b are negative.

Let me handle each case separately.

First, both positive. For a to be positive, it must be between 0 and 1. For b to be positive, it's between 0 and 4. So the area here is a rectangle from a=0 to 1 and b=0 to 4. The area is (1 - 0) * (4 - 0) = 1*4=4.

Next, both negative. For a to be negative, it's from -3 to 0. For b to be negative, it's from -2 to 0. So the area is (0 - (-3)) * (0 - (-2)) = 3*2=6.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me check if I'm calculating this right. The lengths for a are from -3 to 0, which is 3 units, and for b from -2 to 0, which is 2 units. So yes, 3*2=6. So the area where both are negative is 6.

Now, adding both positive areas: 4 (positive) + 6 (negative) = 10.

So the total favorable area is 10. The probability is favorable over total, which is 10/24. Simplifying that, both divide by 2, so 5/12.

Wait, but let me double-check. Sometimes when dealing with continuous probabilities, especially with rectangles, I might be missing something. Let me visualize the a and b ranges again.

a goes from -3 to 1, which is 4 units, and b from -2 to 4, which is 6 units. The rectangle is 4x6=24. Now, the positive product regions are in the first and third quadrants.

In the first quadrant (both positive), a is 0 to 1 and b is 0 to 4, area=1*4=4.

In the third quadrant (both negative), a is -3 to 0 and b is -2 to 0, area=3*2=6.

So yes, 4+6=10. So 10/24=5/12.

Looking at the options, E is 5/12, so that's the answer.

The probability that the product \(a \cdot b\) is positive is \(\frac{5}{12}\).
