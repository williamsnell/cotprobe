Okay, so I'm trying to solve this multiple-choice question about a shunt motor. Let me read through the problem again and make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question gives me a 230-volt shunt motor with an armature resistance of 0.18 ohms. The armature current shouldn't exceed 76 amps. There are three parts to the question: (a) find the starting resistance needed in series with the armature, (b) find the resistance after the motor accelerates when the counter EMF (E_c) is 168 volts, and (c) find the starting current if no resistance is inserted.

First, I need to recall some basic concepts about shunt motors. In a shunt motor, the field winding is connected in parallel with the armature. The armature current is the same as the line current because the field and armature are in parallel, but I might need to think about how the counter EMF affects the armature circuit.

Starting resistance is usually added in series with the armature to limit the initial current when the motor starts. Without this resistance, the current could be too high, which is bad for the motor. So part (a) is about calculating this starting resistance.

For part (a), the formula I remember is V = I * (R_armature + R_starting + R_field). Wait, no, wait. Wait, in shunt motors, the field is in parallel, so maybe that's not the right approach. Let me think. When the motor starts, the counter EMF isn't present because the armature isn't moving yet. So the entire supply voltage has to drop across the armature and the starting resistor.

Wait, but the supply voltage is 230 volts, and the armature resistance is 0.18 ohms. The maximum allowed current is 76 amps. So the voltage across the armature and the starting resistor must be 230 volts. Wait, no. Wait, the supply voltage is across the armature plus the starting resistor because they're in series. The field is in parallel, so the field current is from the supply, I_field = V_shunt / R_shunt. Wait, but R_shunt is given as the armature resistance, which is 0.18 ohms? No, wait, no. The armature resistance is R_a, and the field is another resistor, R_f. But the problem didn't give R_f, so maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, perhaps for part (a), the starting resistance is in series with the armature. So the total armature circuit includes R_start and R_a. The supply voltage is 230V, and the maximum current is 76A. So the total voltage drop across armature and starting resistor should be 230V.

So, V = I * (R_a + R_start). But wait, in shunt motors, the field is in parallel, so when starting, the field is already connected. So the field current is V / R_field. But R_field isn't given. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the problem is assuming that at starting, the motor behaves as a resistor in series with the supply. So the total voltage is across R_start and R_a. So V = I * (R_start + R_a). Solving for R_start.

Given V = 230 V, I = 76 A, R_a = 0.18 ohms.

So R_start = (V / I) - R_a.

So R_start = (230 / 76) - 0.18.

Let me calculate 230 / 76. 76 * 3 is 228, so it's approximately 2.999, about 3 ohms. So 3 - 0.18 = 2.82 ohms. So part (a) would be approximately 2.82 ohms. Looking at the options, option H's part (a) is 2.82 ohms. But let's check other options. Option E's (a) is 2.3, F is 2.5, G is 2.9, etc.

Wait, but maybe I'm forgetting about the brush drop. The problem mentions a 2-volt drop at the brushes. Oh, right! So the total voltage available for the armature circuit is 230 - 2 = 228 V. So I should use 228 V instead of 230.

So recalculating: R_start = (228 / 76) - 0.18.

228 / 76 is 3 exactly. So 3 - 0.18 = 2.82 ohms. So yes, part (a) is 2.82 ohms. So option H's (a) is 2.82, which matches.

Now part (b): the resistance can be reduced when E_c is 168 V. So when the motor is running and has some speed, the counter EMF E_c is generated, which opposes the supply voltage. So the voltage across the armature resistance at that point is (V - E_c) - Ia * R_a.

Wait, more accurately, the armature voltage equation is V = Ia * R_a + E_c. So when E_c is 168 V, the voltage drop across R_a is (V - E_c). Wait, but V is 230 V, so 230 - 168 = 62 V. So the voltage across R_a is 62 V.

But wait, that's the voltage across the armature. So the current Ia is 62 V / R_a. R_a is 0.18 ohms, so Ia = 62 / 0.18 ≈ 344.44 amps. But wait, that can't be right because the maximum current is 76 A. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, perhaps I should consider that with the counter EMF, the total voltage across the armature and the starting resistor (if any) is E_c. Wait, no, when the motor is running, the starting resistor isn't in the circuit anymore, or perhaps it's been reduced. Wait, the question part (b) is about the resistance after starting, so the starting resistance is no longer in the circuit. So the armature is directly connected, so the voltage across it is (V - E_c) minus any brush drops. Wait, but the brush drop is 2 V, so the total voltage across the armature is (230 - 2) - E_c = 228 - 168 = 60 V. So the armature voltage is 60 V.

So Ia = 60 V / R_a = 60 / 0.18 ≈ 333.33 amps. But this would be the current when E_c is 168 V. But wait, the question says "the value to which this resistance can be reduced". Wait, no, perhaps I'm misunderstanding part (b). It says, calculate the resistance that can be reduced when the motor accelerates until E_c is 168 V.

Wait, perhaps the starting resistance is being reduced step-wise, and when E_c reaches 168 V, the resistance is further adjusted. Alternatively, maybe part (b) is about the resistance that remains in the circuit when E_c is 168 V. But in that case, the resistance would be zero because once the motor is running, the starting resistor is removed. But that's not one of the options.

Wait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think again.

When the motor starts, the starting resistance R_start is in series with the armature. As the motor speeds up, we reduce R_start. At the point when E_c is 168 V, what is the required resistance?

Wait, perhaps the motor is in a step-braking scenario, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering that the motor is running with some resistance still in the armature circuit, and when E_c is 168 V, what's the required resistance to limit the current.

Wait, perhaps the formula to use is:

V = I * (R_start + R_a) + E_c.

Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Alternatively, the total voltage is across the armature and the starting resistor, and the counter EMF is part of the armature's voltage.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is:

The total voltage (after considering brush drop) is 228 V. When E_c is 168 V, the armature current Ia can be found using V = Ia * R_a + E_c.

So 228 = Ia * 0.18 + 168.

So Ia = (228 - 168) / 0.18 = 60 / 0.18 ≈ 333.33 A.

But that's a very high current, which exceeds the maximum allowed 76 A. So this can't be right. Therefore, perhaps there's a mistake in my approach.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is V = E_c + Ia * R_a.

So Ia = (V - E_c) / R_a.

But V is 228 V, E_c is 168 V, so Ia = (228 - 168) / 0.18 ≈ 333.33 A. Again, this is way above the 76 A limit. So that can't be. Therefore, perhaps I'm misunderstanding part (b).

Wait, maybe part (b) is asking for the resistance that must be in the armature circuit when E_c is 168 V to keep the current at 76 A. So, if when E_c is 168 V, the current is still 76 A, what resistance would be needed in series?

So in that case, the total voltage drop would be I * (R_a + R_new) = 228 V.

Wait, no. Because E_c is part of the equation. Let me think again.

The voltage equation is:

V = E_c + Ia * (R_a + R_new).

Because R_new is the resistance inserted in series at that point.

Wait, but when the motor is running, the starting resistance is being reduced. So in this scenario, when E_c is 168 V, the current is 76 A.

So 228 V = 168 V + 76 A * (0.18 + R_new).

So 228 - 168 = 76 * (0.18 + R_new).

60 = 76*(0.18 + R_new).

So 0.18 + R_new = 60 /76 ≈ 0.7895.

So R_new ≈ 0.7895 - 0.18 ≈ 0.6095 ohms, approximately 0.61 ohms.

Looking at the options, option H's part (b) is 0.61 ohms, which matches.

Now part (c): the armature current at starting if no resistance is inserted. So if R_start is zero, then the current would be V / (R_a + R_field) but wait, no, in a shunt motor, the field is in parallel. So when starting, the field is already connected, so the total voltage is across the armature and the field in parallel. Wait, no, that's not correct. When starting, the armature is in series with the starting resistor, and the field is in parallel.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is that when no starting resistor is inserted, the armature is directly connected, so the armature resistance is R_a, and the field resistance is R_f. But the problem doesn't give R_f, so maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the shunt motor's field resistance is part of the circuit when calculating starting current. But without R_f, I can't compute it. Alternatively, perhaps the field current is not part of the armature circuit.

Wait, when the motor starts, the armature is in series with the supply voltage, and the field is in parallel. So the armature current is Ia = V / R_a, but considering the brush drop.

Wait, the supply voltage is 230 V, but with a 2 V drop at the brushes, so V_armature = 230 - 2 = 228 V.

If no starting resistance is inserted, R_start = 0, so the armature resistance is R_a = 0.18 ohms.

So Ia = 228 V / 0.18 ohms ≈ 1266.67 A. Looking at the options, option H's part (c) is 1,265 A, which is close to this value.

Wait, but let me double-check. 228 / 0.18 is 1266.666..., which is approximately 1,267 A. The closest option is H, which says 1,265 A, which is very close. So that's part (c).

So putting it all together:

(a) 2.82 ohms (option H)
(b) 0.61 ohms (option H)
(c) ~1,265 A (option H)

So the correct option is H.
</think>

The problem involves a 230-volt shunt motor with an armature resistance of 0.18 ohms and a maximum allowable armature current of 76 amps. The goal is to determine the starting resistance, the resistance after acceleration when the counter EMF (E_c) is 168 volts, and the armature current if no resistance is inserted.

### Part (a): Starting Resistance
At start, the counter EMF is zero, so the entire supply voltage (230 V) must drop across the armature resistance (R_a = 0.18 ohms) and the starting resistance (R_start). The formula used is:

\[
V = I \cdot (R_a + R_{\text{start}})
\]

Given \( V = 230 \, \text{V} \), \( I = 76 \, \text{A} \), and \( R_a = 0.18 \, \Omega \), we calculate:

\[
R_{\text{start}} = \frac{V}{I} - R_a = \frac{230}{76} - 0.18 \approx 2.82 \, \Omega
\]

Thus, the starting resistance is **2.82 ohms**.

### Part (b): Resistance After Acceleration
When the motor accelerates, the counter EMF \( E_c = 168 \, \text{V} \) is generated. The voltage across the armature is now shared between the armature resistance and the remaining resistance. The formula used is:

\[
V_{\text{armature}} = V - E_c = 230 - 2 - 168 = 60 \, \text{V}
\]

The current at this stage is:

\[
I_a = \frac{V_{\text{armature}}}{R_a + R_{\text{new}}} = \frac{60}{0.18 + R_{\text{new}}}
\]

Setting \( I_a = 76 \, \text{A} \) (maximum allowable current):

\[
76 = \frac{60}{0.18 + R_{\text{new}}}
\]

Solving for \( R_{\text{new}} \):

\[
R_{\text{new}} = \frac{60}{76} - 0.18 \approx 0.61 \, \Omega
\]

Thus, the resistance after acceleration is **0.61 ohms**.

### Part (c): Armature Current Without Starting Resistance
If no starting resistance is inserted, the entire supply voltage (230 V, minus a 2 V brush drop) is applied directly to the armature. The armature resistance is \( R_a = 0.18 \, \Omega \). The current is:

\[
I_a = \frac{V_{\text{armature}}}{R_a} = \frac{228}{0.18} \approx 1266.67 \, \text{A}
\]

Rounding to the nearest option, this is approximately **1,265 A**.

### Final Answer
The correct option is **H**.
