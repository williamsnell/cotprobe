Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again.

A chemist has an unknown element X with an atomic weight of 210.197 amu. It consists of two isotopes: ^210X and ^212X. Their masses are 209.64 amu and 211.66 amu respectively. The question is asking for the relative abundance of the two isotopes.

Hmm, right. I remember that the atomic weight is essentially the average of the isotopic masses, weighted by their abundances. So I think I need to set up an equation where the sum of (abundance × mass) for each isotope equals the atomic weight.

Let me denote the abundance of ^210X as 'a' and ^212X as 'b'. Since they're the only two isotopes, their abundances should add up to 100%, or 1 in decimal form. So, a + b = 1.

The atomic weight equation would be:
a*(209.64) + b*(211.66) = 210.197.

But since b is 1 - a, I can substitute that in. So the equation becomes:
a*(209.64) + (1 - a)*(211.66) = 210.197.

Let me expand that. 209.64a + 211.66 - 211.66a = 210.197.

Combining like terms:
(209.64a - 211.66a) + 211.66 = 210.197
(-2.02a) + 211.66 = 210.197.

Now, subtract 211.66 from both sides:
-2.02a = 210.197 - 211.66
Which is:
-2.02a = -1.463.

Divide both sides by -2.02:
a = (-1.463)/(-2.02) ≈ 0.7242.

So a is approximately 72.42%, which is the abundance of ^210X. Then b, which is 1 - a, would be 1 - 0.7242 = 0.2758, or 27.58%.

Looking at the options, option C is 72.42% and 27.587%. That seems to match. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Wait, let me recalculate the subtraction part: 210.197 - 211.66. 210.197 minus 211.66 is indeed -1.463. Then, dividing -1.463 by -2.02 gives a positive number. Let me do that division again.

1.463 divided by 2.02. Let me see: 2.02 times 0.7 is 1.414. 0.72 *2.02 is 1.4544. 0.724 *2.02: 0.724 *2 is 1.448, 0.724 *0.02 is 0.01448. So total is 1.46248. Oh, that's very close to 1.463. So a=0.724, which is 72.4%.

So yes, option C is correct.

The relative abundances of the isotopes are approximately 72.42% for ^210X and 27.587% for ^212X. 

Answer: C
