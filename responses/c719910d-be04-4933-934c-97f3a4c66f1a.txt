Okay, so I have this question about calculating the monthly mortgage payment for a $100,000 loan over 30 years with a 9% interest rate. I'm a bit rusty on my financial formulas, but I remember that this involves an amortization calculation. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I recall that the monthly mortgage payment can be calculated using the formula for a fixed-rate mortgage. The formula is:

M = P * [i(1+i)^n]/[(1+i)^n - 1]

Where:
- M is the monthly payment
- P is the principal loan amount
- i is the monthly interest rate (annual rate divided by 12)
- n is the number of payments (loan term in years multiplied by 12)

So, plugging in the numbers:
- P = $100,000
- The annual interest rate is 9%, so the monthly rate i = 9% / 12 = 0.75% or 0.0075 in decimal.
- The loan term is 30 years, so n = 30 * 12 = 360 months.

Now, let me compute each part step by step.

First, calculate (1 + i)^n. That's (1.0075)^360. Hmm, I don't remember the exact value, but I think it's a large number. Maybe around 100 or more? Let me think. Alternatively, I can approximate it using logarithms or natural exponents, but that might be too time-consuming. Alternatively, I remember that for a 30-year mortgage at 9%, the factor (1+i)^n is about 100. But I'm not sure. Wait, maybe it's better to use the formula step by step.

Alternatively, I can use the present value of an annuity formula, which is what the mortgage payment formula is based on. The formula is M = P * (i(1+i)^n)/( (1+i)^n -1 )

Let me compute (1.0075)^360. Let's see, using a calculator would help, but since I don't have one, I can approximate. Let's see, the rule of 72 says that at 7.5% (which is close to our monthly rate of 0.75%), it would take about 9.6 years to double. Wait, no, the rule of 72 is for doubling time at a given interest rate. So for 0.75%, the doubling time would be 72 / 0.75 = 96 months. So every 96 months, the amount doubles. Since 360 months is 3.75 times 96 (because 96*3=288, 96*4=384). So from 96 to 192 to 288 to 384. So at 360 months, it's 3.75 doublings. Each doubling is about 100%, so 2^3.75 is roughly 10 * 2^0.75. 2^0.75 is about 1.68, so total is around 16.8. But wait, that's the factor (1.0075)^360. So approximately 16.8?

Wait, that doesn't seem right because I think the factor for a 30-year mortgage at 9% is higher. Let me check another way. Maybe I can remember that for a 30-year mortgage at 6%, the monthly payment on $100k is around $596. But since 9% is higher, the payment should be higher than that. Looking at the options, the options are from $650 to $1000. So the correct payment should be higher than $596, which makes sense.

Alternatively, I can use the formula step by step more carefully.

Compute i = 0.0075

Compute (1 + i)^n = (1.0075)^360. Let me see if I can estimate this more accurately. Let's break it down:

The formula for compound interest is (1 + r)^t. So r=0.0075, t=360.

Alternatively, using the formula:

ln(1.0075) ≈ 0.00747 (using the approximation ln(1+x) ≈ x - x^2/2 + x^3/3 - ... for small x). So ln(1.0075) ≈ 0.00747.

Then, ln(1.0075)^360 = 360 * 0.00747 ≈ 2.69.

So e^2.69 ≈ 15. So (1.0075)^360 ≈ 15.

Wait, that's different from my earlier estimate. So maybe around 15?

If that's the case, then the denominator (1.0075)^360 -1 = 15-1=14.

The numerator is i*(1+i)^n = 0.0075 *15=0.1125.

So M = 100,000 * (0.1125 /14) = 100,000 * (0.0080357) ≈ 803.57.

Looking at the options, D is $804.62, which is very close to this estimate. So I think D is the correct answer.

Alternatively, perhaps my approximation of (1.0075)^360 as 15 is a bit off. Let me see if I can get a more accurate estimate.

Another approach: Using the formula for compound interest, (1 + 0.0075)^360.

We can compute this using logarithms or exponentials.

Alternatively, using the formula for the present value of an annuity, which is what this problem is about.

Alternatively, I can use the formula for the monthly payment, which I have as M = P * [i(1+i)^n]/[(1+i)^n -1].

Plugging in the numbers:

i = 0.0075

n=360

So compute (1.0075)^360.

I think a more precise way is to accept that without a calculator, the exact value is hard, but my approximation gave me around 15, leading to M≈$803.57, which is close to option D: $804.62.

Alternatively, perhaps the exact value is a bit higher, which would make the payment a bit higher, so D is the correct option.

To calculate the monthly mortgage payment for a $100,000 loan over 30 years with a 9% annual interest rate, we use the fixed-rate mortgage formula:

\[
M = P \times \frac{i(1+i)^n}{(1+i)^n - 1}
\]

Where:
- \( P = 100,000 \) (loan amount),
- \( i = \frac{9\%}{12} = 0.0075 \) (monthly interest rate),
- \( n = 30 \times 12 = 360 \) (number of payments).

First, approximate \( (1.0075)^{360} \). Using logarithms and exponentials, we estimate this factor to be around 15. Plugging this into the formula:

\[
M = 100,000 \times \frac{0.0075 \times 15}{15 - 1} = 100,000 \times \frac{0.1125}{14} \approx 100,000 \times 0.0080357 \approx 803.57
\]

This estimate is very close to option D: $804.62, which aligns with the expected payment for a 30-year mortgage at 9%. Therefore, the correct answer is:

D
