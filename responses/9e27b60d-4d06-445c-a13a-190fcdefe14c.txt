Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I need to figure out Martha Michael's yearly earnings based on her monthly telephone bill. Let's see. The problem says she spends $360 a month on her telephone bills, and that's 6 and 1/4 percent of her annual earnings. Hmm, I need to find her total yearly income.

Alright, let's break this down. First, the percentage. 6 and 1/4 percent. I think that's 6.25%. Because 1/4 is 0.25, right? So 6 plus 0.25 is 6.25%. So that's 6.25% as a decimal.

Now, the monthly amount she spends is $360. So, this $360 is 6.25% of her annual earnings. Let me denote her annual earnings as E. So, 6.25% of E equals $360. In equation form, that's 0.0625 * E = 360.

Wait, yes, because percentages can be converted by multiplying by 0.01. So 6.25% is 6.25/100, which is 0.0625.

Now, to find E, I can rearrange the equation. So, E = 360 / 0.0625.

Let me calculate that. 360 divided by 0.0625. Hmm, dividing by a decimal can be tricky. Alternatively, I can think of it as multiplying by the reciprocal. The reciprocal of 0.0625 is 16, because 0.0625 is 1/16. So, 360 * 16 should give me E.

Wait, 360 times 16. Let me compute that step by step. 360 * 10 is 3600, 360 * 6 is 2160. Adding those together: 3600 + 2160 = 5760. So E is $5,760.

Looking back at the options, let's see. Option E is $5,760. So that's the answer. But wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

Alternatively, another way to think about it: 6.25% of her earnings is $360, so 1% would be $360 divided by 6.25. Let's do that. 360 divided by 6.25. Hmm, 6.25 times 57.6 is 360. Wait, actually, 6.25 times 57.6 is 360. So 1% is $57.6. Then, 100% would be 57.6 * 100 = $5,760. Yep, same result.

So the correct answer must be option E, $5,760.
