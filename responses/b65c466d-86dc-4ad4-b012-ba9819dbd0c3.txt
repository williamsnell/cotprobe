Question:

A 30-year-old woman, gravida 2, para 0, aborta 1, at 28 weeks' gestation comes to the office for a prenatal visit. She has had one previous pregnancy resulting in a spontaneous abortion at 12 weeks' gestation. Today, her vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows a uterus consistent in size with a 28-week gestation. Fetal ultrasonography shows a male fetus with no abnormalities. Her blood group is O, Rh-negative. The father's blood group is B, Rh-positive. The physician recommends administration of Rho

Options:

A: Development of polycythemia
B: Formation of antibodies to RhB
C: Development of lymphocytosis
D: Formation of antibodies to RhO
E: immune globulin to the patient. This treatment is most likely to prevent which of the following in this mother?
F: Development of leukocytosis
G: Formation of antibodies to RhD
H: Development of anemia
I: Formation of antibodies to RhC
J: Development of natural killer cells

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this medical question. Let me break it down step by step. 

The patient is a 30-year-old woman who is gravida 2, para 0, and has one abortion. She's currently at 28 weeks' gestation. Her vital signs are normal, and the uterus size matches the gestational age. The ultrasound shows a healthy male fetus with no abnormalities. Her blood type is O, Rh-negative, and the father is B, Rh-positive.

The question is about the physician recommending Rho immune globulin. I remember that Rho immune globulin is given to Rh-negative mothers to prevent Rh incompatibility issues, especially in subsequent pregnancies. 

So, Rh incompatibility happens when the mother's blood is Rh-negative and the baby's is Rh-positive. The mother's immune system can produce antibodies against the baby's red blood cells, leading to issues like hemolytic disease of the newborn (HDN). 

In this case, the mother is Rh-negative, and the father is Rh-positive. Since the father is Rh-positive, there's a 50% chance the baby would be Rh-positive. The mother has had a previous spontaneous abortion at 12 weeks, so this isn't her first pregnancy. 

Rho immune globulin works by binding to the fetal Rh antigens in the mother's blood, preventing her immune system from recognizing and attacking them. This should prevent the formation of anti-Rh antibodies in the mother.

Looking at the options, the answer should relate to the formation of antibodies. The possible options are B, D, G, I, and others. 

Wait, Rh factors are usually D, C, c, and e. The common one is RhD. So when Rh-negative mothers are sensitized, they develop antibodies against RhD. So the treatment would prevent the formation of antibodies to RhD, which is option G.

Other options: A is about polycythemia, which I don't think is related here. C is lymphocytosis, which isn't directly linked. E is about immune globulin, which is the treatment itself, not the outcome prevented. F is leukocytosis, not relevant. H is anemia, which can be a result but not the primary prevention here. J is natural killer cells, which isn't the main issue. So the correct answer should be G: Formation of antibodies to RhD.

The physician administers Rho immune globulin to prevent the mother from forming antibodies against RhD, which could lead to hemolytic disease of the newborn. 

Answer: G
