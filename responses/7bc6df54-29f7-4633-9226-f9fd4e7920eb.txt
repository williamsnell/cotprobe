Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem to solve. The question is about calculating the standard Gibbs free energy change (ΔrG°) at 375 K for a reaction using the Gibbs-Helmholtz equation. The reaction given is 2 CO(g) + O2(g) → 2 CO2(g). They provided the ΔrG° and ΔrH° at 298 K, but wait, looking again, the question only mentions the values of ΔrG°(298 K) and ΔrH°(298 K), but those values aren't listed here. Hmm, maybe they were provided in the actual problem statement, but in this case, I might need to proceed without specific numbers, or perhaps the user will clarify. Alternatively, perhaps I should proceed with the method regardless.

Wait, the user's instruction just gives the options and the question. Oh, I think I'm given the reaction and that I need to use the Gibbs-Helmholtz equation. Let me recall what the Gibbs-Helmholtz equation is. The general form is ΔG = ΔH - TΔS. But wait, that's the Gibbs equation. Oh wait, no—the Gibbs-Helmholtz equation relates the change in Gibbs free energy to enthalpy and entropy. The equation for the Gibbs free energy change at a different temperature can be found using the formula:

ΔrG°(T2) ≈ ΔrH°(T1) - T2 * (ΔrS°(T1))

But wait, that's an approximation because the entropy change might vary with temperature. Alternatively, sometimes the equation is written as ΔG = ΔH - TΔS, where ΔS is the entropy change at the standard conditions, which is at 298 K in this case. So perhaps I can use that.

But wait, I need to find ΔrG° at 375 K, given data at 298 K. The reaction is 2 CO + O2 → 2 CO2. So the standard Gibbs free energy change and the standard enthalpy change at 298 K are given. Let's denote these as ΔG°(298) and ΔH°(298). Also, I know that ΔG° = ΔH° - TΔS°, so rearranged, ΔS° = (ΔH° - ΔG°)/T.

Wait, but in the problem, they say to use the Gibbs-Helmholtz equation, so perhaps I need to find ΔG at 375 K using ΔG = ΔH - TΔS, where ΔH is at 298 K, and ΔS is also at 298 K. Wait, but that might not be accurate because entropy can vary with temperature. Alternatively, perhaps I can approximate that ΔS° is constant between 298 K and 375 K, which is a reasonable assumption for small temperature changes.

So the steps would be:

1. Calculate ΔS° at 298 K using ΔG°(298) and ΔH°(298): ΔS° = (ΔH° - ΔG°)/298.

2. Use this ΔS° to calculate ΔG° at 375 K: ΔG°(375) = ΔH°(298) - (375) * ΔS°.

Wait, but wait a minute. Another approach is to use the van't Hoff equation, but that's for K, not directly for Gibbs free energy. Alternatively, perhaps the assumption is that ΔH is approximately constant over the temperature range, and similarly for ΔS, which is often used in such problems.

So let me outline the process again. The Gibbs free energy change at any temperature T can be approximated using:

ΔG°(T) = ΔH°(T) - TΔS°(T)

But if we don't have ΔH° at 375 K, we might approximate ΔH° as being constant, which is a common assumption unless told otherwise. So if ΔH° is approximately the same at both 298 K and 375 K, then we can calculate ΔS° from the 298 K values and plug it into the equation for 375 K.

So, first, find ΔS° at 298 K:

ΔS° = (ΔH°(298) - ΔG°(298)) / 298

Then, plug into the equation for ΔG° at 375 K:

ΔG°(375) = ΔH°(298) - (375) * [ (ΔH°(298) - ΔG°(298)) / 298 ]

Wait, but this would require knowing both ΔH°(298) and ΔG°(298). Since the problem says "from the values of ΔrG°(298 K) and ΔrH°(298 K)", I must have these values. But in the user's question, they didn't provide specific numbers, so perhaps I should proceed symbolically.

Wait, but perhaps I can compute this using the given options, but without the actual values, that's not possible. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a typo and the values are provided in the options, but no, the options are the possible answers, not the given data.

Wait, perhaps I should look up standard values for ΔG and ΔH for this reaction, as they're often given in tables. Let me think; the reaction is 2 CO(g) + O2(g) → 2 CO2(g). I think the standard enthalpy change for this reaction is known. Let me recall: the standard enthalpy of formation of CO is about -110 kJ/mol (wait, no, wait: wait, CO has a ΔfH° of about -110.5 kJ/mol. Wait no, wait, actually, CO's ΔfH° is around -110.5 kJ/mol, and CO2's is about -393.5 kJ/mol. So for the reaction:

2 CO (g) + O2 (g) → 2 CO2 (g), the ΔrH° would be:

[2 * (-393.5)] - [2*(-110.5) + 0], since O2 is in standard state and has ΔfH°=0.

So that's 2*(-393.5) = -787, and 2*(-110.5) = -221. So ΔrH° = (-787) - (-221) = -566 kJ/mol.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check: the reaction is 2 CO + O2 → 2 CO2. So the moles of CO2 produced are 2, so 2*(-393.5) = -787. The reactants are 2 CO and 1 O2. CO has ΔfH° of -110.5, so 2*(-110.5) = -221. O2 is zero. So ΔrH° = (-787) - (-221) = (-787 +221) = -566 kJ/mol.

Similarly, for Gibbs free energy change, ΔfG° for CO is about -137.2 kJ/mol, and for CO2 it's about -394.4 kJ/mol. So for the reaction:

ΔrG° = [2*(-394.4)] - [2*(-137.2) + 0] = (-788.8) - (-274.4) = (-788.8 + 274.4) = -514.4 kJ/mol, but wait, I think I might be mixing up standard values. Alternatively, perhaps I should proceed with symbols.

But given that the problem asks to calculate ΔrG°(375 K) using the values at 298 K and the Gibbs-Helmholtz equation, perhaps the calculation is as follows:

Given ΔrG°(298) = G298, ΔrH°(298) = H298.

Compute ΔS° = (H298 - G298) / 298.

Then, ΔG°(375) = H298 - 375 * S°.

But wait, wait, the standard entropy change (ΔS°) can be calculated from the standard values at 298 K. So perhaps:

ΔS° = (ΔH°(298) - ΔG°(298)) / 298

Then, ΔG°(375) = ΔH°(298) - (375) * ΔS°

Substituting S°:

ΔG°(375) = H298 - 375 * ( (H298 - G298)/298 )

Let me compute this expression:

= H298 - (375/298)*(H298 - G298)

= H298 * [1 - (375/298)] + (375/298)*G298

Hmm, perhaps I can plug in the actual numbers. Wait, in the problem, the user didn't provide the ΔrG° and ΔrH° values, but perhaps I can proceed with hypothetical values.

Alternatively, perhaps the given options can help. But without the specific values, it's tricky. Let me try to proceed with the assumption that the given data are standard values.

Wait, perhaps the problem provides that ΔrG°(298) is, say, -514 kJ/mol, and ΔrH°(298) is -566 kJ/mol. Let me go with these numbers as an example.

So, H298 = -566 kJ/mol, G298 = -514 kJ/mol.

Then, S° = (H - G)/T = ( (-566) - (-514) ) / 298

= (-52) / 298 ≈ -0.1744 kJ/(mol·K) → -174.4 J/(mol·K)

Then, compute ΔG°(375 K):

ΔG = H - T*S = (-566) - 375*(-0.1744)

= -566 + (375 * 0.1744)

Compute 375 * 0.1744:

375 * 0.1744 = let's see:

375 * 0.1 = 37.5

375 * 0.07 = 26.25

375 * 0.0044 = 1.65

Adding up: 37.5 +26.25=63.75 +1.65=65.4

So, 375*0.1744 ≈ 65.4 kJ.

So ΔG = (-566) + 65.4 = -500.6 kJ/mol.

Looking at the options, option D is -501 kJ/mol, which is very close to this value. So the answer would be D.

Wait, but in reality, the actual values might differ. Let me check the standard values again.

Wait, the standard enthalpy of reaction for 2CO + O2 → 2CO2 is indeed ΔrH° = 2*(ΔfH° CO2) - [2*(ΔfH° CO) + ΔfH° O2]

ΔfH° CO2 is -393.5 kJ/mol, so 2*(-393.5) = -787 kJ.

ΔfH° CO is -110.5 kJ/mol, so 2*(-110.5) = -221 kJ.

So ΔrH° = (-787) - (-221) = -566 kJ.

For Gibbs free energy, ΔfG° CO is -137.2 kJ/mol, CO2 is -394.4 kJ/mol.

So ΔrG° = 2*(-394.4) - [2*(-137.2) + 0] = (-788.8) - (-274.4) = (-788.8 +274.4) = -514.4 kJ.

So H298 = -566 kJ, G298 = -514.4 kJ.

So S° = (H - G)/T = (-566 - (-514.4)) / 298 = (-51.6) /298 ≈ -0.1732 kJ/(mol·K) → -173.2 J/(mol·K).

Then, ΔG(375) = H298 - T * S° = (-566) - 375*(-0.1732) = (-566) + (375 * 0.1732).

Compute 375 * 0.1732:

0.1732 * 300 = 51.96

0.1732 * 75 = 12.99

Total ≈ 51.96 +12.99=64.95 kJ.

So ΔG(375) = -566 +64.95 = -501.05 kJ/mol.

Which rounds to approximately -501 kJ/mol, matching option D.

To calculate the standard Gibbs free energy change (ΔrG°) at 375 K for the reaction:

$$2 \mathrm{CO}(\mathrm{g}) + \mathrm{O}_2(\mathrm{g}) \rightarrow 2 \mathrm{CO}_2(\mathrm{g}),$$

we use the Gibbs-Helmholtz equation:

$$\Delta G^\ominus(T) = \Delta H^\ominus(T) - T \Delta S^\ominus.$$

### Step 1: Calculate ΔS° at 298 K
The entropy change (ΔS°) can be calculated using the relationship:

$$\Delta S^\ominus = \frac{\Delta H^\ominus - \Delta G^\ominus}{T}.$$

Given:
- ΔrH°(298 K) = -566 kJ/mol,
- ΔrG°(298 K) = -514.4 kJ/mol,
- T = 298 K,

\[
\Delta S^\ominus = \frac{-566 - (-514.4)}{298} = \frac{-51.6}{298} \approx -0.1732 \, \mathrm{kJ/(mol \cdot K)} = -173.2 \, \mathrm{J/(mol \cdot K)}.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate ΔG°(375 K)
Using the Gibbs-Helmholtz equation for T = 375 K:

\[
\Delta G^\ominus(375 \, \mathrm{K}) = \Delta H^\ominus(298 \, \mathrm{K}) - T \cdot \Delta S^\ominus.
\]

Substitute the values:
- ΔH° = -566 kJ/mol,
- T = 375 K,
- ΔS° = -0.1732 kJ/(mol·K),

\[
\Delta G^\ominus(375 \, \mathrm{K}) = -566 - (375 \cdot -0.1732).
\]

First, calculate \(375 \cdot -0.1732\):

\[
375 \cdot -0.1732 = -65.055 \, \mathrm{kJ}.
\]

Now, substitute back:

\[
\Delta G^\ominus(375 \, \mathrm{K}) = -566 + 65.055 = -500.945 \, \mathrm{kJ/mol}.
\]

Rounding to three significant figures:

\[
\Delta G^\ominus(375 \, \mathrm{K}) \approx -501 \, \mathrm{kJ/mol}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The standard Gibbs free energy change at 375 K is closest to **-501 kJ/mol**, which corresponds to **option D**.
