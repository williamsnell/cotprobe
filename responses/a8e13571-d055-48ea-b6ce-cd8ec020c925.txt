Question:

Why does the plasma (ion) tail of a comet always point away from the Sun?

Options:

A: The ions are following Keplerian orbits that lead away from the Sun.
B: The conservation of the angular momentum in the tail keeps it always pointing away from the Sun.
C: The solar wind electromagnetically "blows" the ions directly away from the Sun.
D: The ions are repelled by the Sun's magnetic field.
E: The gravity of other celestial bodies pulls the ions away from the Sun.
F: The tail is a reflection of the Sun's light and therefore points away from it.
G: The ions are naturally attracted to the colder regions of space, away from the Sun.
H: The Sun's radiation causes a chemical reaction that propels the ions away.
I: The heat of the Sun evaporates the ions, causing them to move away.
J: Radiation pressure from the Sun's light pushes the ions away.

Okay, so I have this question about why a comet's plasma tail always points away from the Sun. Hmm, I remember that comets have two tails, the dust tail and the ion tail. The ion tail is the one that's more straight and points away from the Sun. 

Wait, why is that? I think it has something to do with the solar wind or maybe the Sun's magnetic field. Oh right, the solar wind is a stream of charged particles coming from the Sun. Since the ion tail is made of ions, which are charged, the solar wind would interact with them.

So the solar wind is moving outward from the Sun at high speeds. If the ion tail is made of ions, the solar wind might be pushing them away. That sounds like radiation pressure. Radiation pressure is when light or other forms of radiation exert pressure on objects. But wait, the solar wind is actually particles, not just light. So maybe it's more about the particles colliding with the ions and pushing them away.

Alternatively, I've heard that the ion tail is shaped by the magnetic field of the solar wind. The ions are charged, so they respond to magnetic fields. The solar wind carries the Sun's magnetic field with it, and as it moves past the comet, it drags the ions along, causing the tail to point away.

Wait, but the options don't mention magnetic fields directly. Let me look at the options again.

Option C says the solar wind electromagnetically blows the ions away. Electromagnetic because the solar wind is charged particles, so they interact electromagnetically with the ions. That makes sense.

Option J says radiation pressure from the Sun's light pushes the ions. I'm not sure if that's the main reason. I thought the solar wind's particles were more influential because they have momentum and can push the ions.

Option H says the Sun's radiation causes a chemical reaction. I don't think that's it. Comets are mostly made of ice and dust, but the ionization is more about ion loss than chemical reactions.

Option I says the heat evaporates the ions. Well, the heat does sublimate the comet's ice, but the tail is more about the ions being pushed away, not just evaporated.

Option D says the ions are repelled by the Sun's magnetic field. Well, the Sun's magnetic field lines go out into the solar system, and the solar wind carries them. The ions in the tail are aligned along these field lines, so maybe it's not repulsion but more like being carried along the field.

Wait, but the ion tail is always pointing away, so it's more about the direction the solar wind is moving. The solar wind is moving radially outward from the Sun, so it pushes the ions in that direction.

So the main reason is the solar wind pushing the ions. Looking back at the options, option C says the solar wind electromagnetically blows them away, which fits.

Alternatively, option J is about radiation pressure from light. I'm not sure if that's significant compared to the solar wind. I think the solar wind's particles have more impact on the ion tail.

So I'm leaning towards option C.

The plasma (ion) tail of a comet points away from the Sun primarily due to the interaction between the ionized particles in the tail and the solar wind. The solar wind is a stream of charged particles emanating from the Sun, which exerts a force on the charged ions in the comet's tail. This force, combined with the electromagnetic properties of the solar wind, causes the ions to be pushed away from the Sun, resulting in the tail always pointing in that direction.

Answer: C
