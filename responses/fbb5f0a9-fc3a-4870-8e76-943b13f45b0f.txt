Okay, so I need to figure out what Delta Burke's character's job is on the sitcom 'Designing Women'. I'm not super familiar with the show, but I remember it's about a group of women working in a design-related field. Let me think about what I know.

First, Delta Burke is an actress I recognize, though I'm not sure which role she's famous for. Wait, wasn't she in 'Designing Women'? I think that's right. The show is a sitcom that revolves around a group of women working together, probably in some design-related business. From what I recall, the main characters are all involved in interior design or something similar.

So the question is about her specific job. The options include various design-related fields like furniture designer, fashion stylist, event planner, interior designer, architect, floral designer, graphic designer, magazine editor, fashion designer, and website designer. I need to narrow this down.

I think Delta Burke's character was one of the main characters. The show's title is 'Designing Women', which suggests they all work in design. Maybe her role was related to interior design? I seem to remember that her character was a bit of a no-nonsense type, maybe the lead designer. 

I'm trying to visualize the cast. There was a group of women, including someone named Maryann Thorpe, played by Delta Burke. Maryann was the lead designer, I believe. So her job would be interior designer. Let me check the options again. Option D is interior designer. That makes sense because the show was about interior designers working together in a business.

I don't think she was an architect because that's a different profession, more about building structures. Fashion designer or stylist might be related, but I think the main focus was on interior design. Event planner could be part of it, but I think her character's primary role was designing interiors.

So putting it all together, Delta Burke's character was an interior designer on 'Designing Women'. The answer should be D.
