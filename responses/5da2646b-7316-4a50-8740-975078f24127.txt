Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electromagnetic induction. Hmm, let me think. Alright, I'll start by reading the question carefully.

The problem says: There's a square coil with an area of 50 cm², which is 0.005 m² because I remember that 1 m² is 10,000 cm², right? So 50 cm² is 50/10000 = 0.005 m². The coil has 20 loops, which I think means 20 turns. It's rotated about a transverse axis at 2 turns per second. The magnetic field is uniform with a flux density of 500 gauss. Oh wait, gauss to tesla conversion—since 1 Tesla is 10,000 gauss, so 500 gauss is 0.05 T. The coil's resistance is 20 ohms.

The question has three parts: (a) average EMF during one quarter cycle, (b) average current in a complete cycle, and (c) charge passed in this interval.

Starting with part (a). I remember Faraday's Law of electromagnetic induction. The induced EMF in a coil is given by EMF = N * dΦ/dt, where N is the number of turns, and Φ is magnetic flux.

Magnetic flux Φ is B * A * cosθ, where θ is the angle between the magnetic field and the normal to the coil. Since the coil is rotating about a transverse axis, the angle θ will change with time. At t=0, the coil is perpendicular to the field, so θ=0, cosθ=1. As it rotates, θ increases until at 90 degrees, cosθ=0.

The coil makes 2 turns per second, so the angular frequency ω is 2 * 2π radians per second, which is 4π rad/s. Wait, no, wait. No, wait. The rotation is 2 turns per second, so each turn is 2π radians. So the angular velocity ω is 2 * 2π = 4π rad/s. Wait, no, wait. Wait, 2 turns per second is 2 rotations per second, meaning each rotation is 2π radians. So ω = 2 * 2π = 4π rad/s. Hmm, no, wait. Wait, actually, no. The angular velocity ω is 2π radians per rotation, so if it's doing 2 rotations per second, ω is 2 * 2π = 4π rad/s. Yes, that seems right.

But wait, the coil is rotating, so the flux Φ as a function of time is Φ = B * A * cosθ(t). Since θ(t) starts at 0 and increases with time, θ(t) = ωt. So Φ(t) = B*A*cos(ωt).

The induced EMF is the negative rate of change of flux: EMF = -N * dΦ/dt. But since we're looking for the average EMF during one quarter cycle, which is from θ=0 to θ=π/2 (a quarter turn), the change in flux is from B*A*(1) to B*A*(0), so the change is -B*A. So the rate of change is (ΔΦ)/(Δt). But since it's a quarter cycle, the time taken for a quarter cycle is (π/2) / ω. Let me compute that.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The coil completes a full rotation (2π radians) in 1/2 seconds because it's rotating at 2 turns per second. So a quarter cycle is (2π radians) / 4 = π/2 radians, which takes (1/2 s) / 4 = 1/8 seconds. Wait, no, wait. Wait, 2 turns per second means each rotation (2π) takes 0.5 seconds. So a quarter rotation is π/2, which takes (0.5 s) / 4 = 0.125 seconds.

But maybe it's easier to think in terms of θ(t) = ωt, where ω = 2π * f, and f is 2 Hz. So ω = 4π rad/s.

The EMF is the average value during the quarter cycle. The instantaneous EMF is EMF = -N * dΦ/dt. Let's compute dΦ/dt: dΦ/dt = -B A ω sin(ωt). So the instantaneous EMF is N B A ω sin(ωt).

Wait, wait, let me do it step by step. Φ(t) = B A cos(ωt). So dΦ/dt = -B A ω sin(ωt). Thus, EMF(t) = -N * dΦ/dt = N B A ω sin(ωt). The negative of the derivative gives the EMF. So EMF(t) = N B A ω sin(ωt).

Now, to find the average EMF over a quarter cycle, which is from t=0 to t=T, where T is the time for a quarter rotation. Since the period T_total for one full rotation is 1/2 seconds, a quarter rotation is T = (1/2)/4 = 1/8 s = 0.125 s.

The average value of sin(ωt) over a quarter cycle. Since the quarter cycle is from 0 to π/2 radians in the argument of sin. So the average of sin(x) from x=0 to x=π/2 is (2/π) * ∫ sin(x) dx from 0 to π/2.

Wait, the average value of a function f(x) over an interval [a, b] is (1/(b-a)) ∫ f(x) dx from a to b.

So the average of sin(ωt) over t from 0 to T, where T = π/(2ω). Because ω = 4π, so T = (π/2)/(4π) )= (1/8) s.

Wait, let me compute ωt over the interval. At t=0: x=0. At t=T=1/8 s: x=ω*(1/8) = 4π *1/8 = π/2.

So the average of sin(x) from x=0 to x=π/2 is (1/(π/2)) * ∫ sin x dx from 0 to π/2.

The integral of sin x dx is -cos x. So from 0 to π/2, it's (-cos(π/2) + cos(0)) = (0 + 1) = 1.

So average sin(x) is (1/(π/2)) * 1 = 2/π ≈ 0.6366.

So the average EMF (E_avg) is N B A ω * (2/π).

Plugging in the numbers:

N=20, B=0.05 T, A=0.005 m², ω=4π rad/s.

E_avg = 20 * 0.05 * 0.005 * 4π * (2/π).

Wait, let's compute this.

First, 20 * 0.05 = 1.

1 * 0.005 = 0.005.

0.005 *4π = 0.02π.

Then multiply by (2/π): 0.02π * 2/π = 0.04.

So E_avg = 0.04 volts. That's part (a) done, and looking at the options, let's check which option has 0.04 V for part (a). Options C and G have 0.04 V.

Okay, moving to part (b): average current in a complete cycle.

I know that average current is current = EMF / resistance. But wait, the EMF varies sinusoidally, so the average current over a full cycle would be the average of EMF/R. Since EMF is sinusoidal, the average of sin function over a full cycle is zero. Wait, but wait, in this case, the EMF is induced during each half cycle, but the current would flow in one direction during one half and the other during the other half. But when considering average current, considering DC, it's the net current over time. Wait, but if the EMF is sinusoidal, the average current might be zero because it's symmetrically positive and negative. However, wait, in reality, the coil's rotation causes the EMF to be induced in one direction during one half cycle and reverse during the other. But over a complete cycle, the net average current would be zero because the positive and negative halves cancel out. But that can't be right because the question is asking for average current in a complete cycle. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The induced EMF is a sinusoidal function, so the current would also be sinusoidal. But when considering average current, it's the mean value over a full cycle. The mean of a sinusoidal function over a full period is zero because it's symmetrically positive and negative. But wait, that can't be correct because the coil would have current in one direction during one half cycle and the opposite during the other.

Wait, but perhaps the average current in the coil over a complete cycle is zero because the current flows in opposite directions during each half-cycle, leading to a net zero average. But that's only if considering AC. However, the question is about average current in a complete cycle, which for AC would typically be zero. But looking at the options, none of them have zero. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the average current is being considered as the RMS current, but the question says average. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the question refers to the average current over a half cycle, but the problem states a complete cycle. Alternatively, perhaps the question is using average as the peak value times some factor.

Wait, perhaps I should reevaluate. The average current is I_avg = (1/T) ∫ I dt over one full period T.

The current I(t) is EMF(t)/R = (N B A ω sin(ωt)) / R.

So I(t) = (N B A ω / R) * sin(ωt).

The average of I(t) over one full cycle is zero because the sine function is positive half the time and negative the other half, leading to cancellation. So the average current would be zero. But that's not among the options. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, maybe the question is considering the average of the absolute value. Alternatively, perhaps the average current is taken as the RMS value, but that's usually denoted as average RMS. Alternatively, perhaps part (b) is referring to the average current during one half cycle, but that's not what the question says.

Wait, perhaps I should think again. The question says, "average current in a complete cycle." So perhaps the correct approach is to compute the average of the absolute value of the current, which would be non-zero.

Wait, but the options don't have zero, so perhaps I'm missing a key point here. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the coil's rotation causes the EMF to go from maximum positive to maximum negative over a full cycle, but the average current would be zero because for every positive current, there's an equal negative current. So the average is zero. But then, looking at the options, none have zero for part (b). So perhaps the question is considering the average as the peak current divided by some factor, but that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the average induced EMF over a complete cycle, but for part (b), the average current would be zero. But again, the options don't have zero. So perhaps I made a mistake in part (a).

Wait, let me recheck part (a). The EMF during a quarter cycle—I calculated it as 0.04 volts, but perhaps the correct approach is to compute the average EMF over a quarter cycle as the peak EMF multiplied by (2/π), but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, the peak EMF is E_peak = N B A ω. Let me compute that. N=20, B=0.05 T, A=0.005 m², ω=4π.

E_peak = 20 * 0.05 * 0.005 *4π.

20 *0.05 =1.

1 *0.005=0.005.

0.005 *4π=0.02π≈0.06283 V.

Wait, but I thought E_avg was 0.04 V, which is (2/π) * E_peak. Because (2/π)*0.06283 ≈ 0.04 V. So that seems correct.

But perhaps for part (b), the average current is zero, but perhaps the question is considering the average as the RMS current, which would be non-zero. Let's compute the RMS current.

I_rms = (E_rms)/R.

E_rms = E_peak / sqrt(2) = 0.06283 / 1.414 ≈ 0.0444 V.

Then I_rms = 0.0444 / 20 = 0.00222 A ≈ 0.0022 A.

But looking at the options, option C has 0.002 A for part (b). Hmm, but I'm not sure if the question is asking for RMS or average. Since average of a sinusoidal over a full cycle is zero, perhaps the intended answer is considering the average of the absolute value, which would be (2/π) * I_peak.

I_peak = E_peak / R = (0.06283 V)/(20 Ω) ≈ 0.00314 A.

The average of the absolute value of the current over a full cycle is (2/π) * I_peak ≈ (2/3.1416)*0.00314 ≈ 0.002 A. Which matches option C's part (b) of 0.002 A.

So perhaps part (b) is 0.002 A.

Moving on to part (c): charge passed through the coil in this interval. Hmm, charge Q is given by Q = I_avg * Δt. But wait, for a time interval Δt, the charge is the integral of current over that time.

But if the interval is a complete cycle, and the average current is zero, then the net charge would be zero, which doesn't make sense. Alternatively, if the interval is a quarter cycle, then the charge would be the integral of current over that quarter cycle.

Wait, the question says part (c) is for the same interval as part (a), which is one quarter cycle. So for part (c), the charge passed in a quarter cycle is the integral of I(t) from t=0 to t=T, where T is the time for a quarter cycle.

I(t) = (N B A ω / R) * sin(ωt).

So Q = ∫ I(t) dt from 0 to T.

Which is (N B A ω / R) ∫ sin(ωt) dt from 0 to T.

Let me compute this integral. The integral of sin(ωt) dt is (-1/ω) cos(ωt). Evaluated from 0 to T.

So Q = (N B A ω / R) * [ (-1/ω)(cos(ωT) - cos(0)) ) ].

Simplify: Q = (N B A ω / R) * [ (-1/ω)(cos(ωT) - 1) ) ]

= (N B A / R) * (-1) [ cos(ωT) - 1 ]

= (N B A / R) * [ 1 - cos(ωT) ]

Since ωT = π/2 (as T is a quarter cycle, ωT= π/2), cos(π/2)=0.

So Q = (N B A / R) * (1 - 0) = N B A / R.

Plugging in the numbers: N=20, B=0.05 T, A=0.005 m², R=20 Ω.

Q = (20 * 0.05 * 0.005) / 20.

Compute numerator: 20 *0.05=1; 1 *0.005=0.005.

0.005 /20 = 0.00025 coulombs.

So Q=0.00025 C.

Looking at the options, option C has 0.00025 coulombs for part (c).

So putting it all together:

(a) 0.04 V,

(b) 0.002 A,

(c) 0.00025 C.

Which matches option C.

The problem involves a square coil with an area of 50 cm² (0.005 m²), 20 loops, and a resistance of 20 Ω, rotating at 2 turns per second in a uniform magnetic field of 500 Gauss (0.05 T). The goal is to determine the average electromotive force (EMF), average current, and charge passed during one quarter cycle.

### Part (a): Average EMF
Using Faraday's Law, the EMF is given by:

\[
\text{EMF} = N \cdot B \cdot A \cdot \omega \cdot \sin(\omega t)
\]

where \( N = 20 \), \( B = 0.05 \, \text{T} \), \( A = 0.005 \, \text{m}^2 \), and \( \omega = 4\pi \, \text{rad/s} \). The average EMF over one quarter cycle is:

\[
\text{E}_{\text{avg}} = \frac{2}{\pi} \cdot \text{E}_{\text{peak}}
\]

\[
\text{E}_{\text{peak}} = 20 \cdot 0.05 \cdot 0.005 \cdot 4\pi = 0.06283 \, \text{V}
\]

\[
\text{E}_{\text{avg}} = \frac{2}{\pi} \cdot 0.06283 \approx 0.04 \, \text{V}
\]

### Part (b): Average Current
The average current over a complete cycle is zero because the EMF is sinusoidal, and the current flows in opposite directions during each half-cycle. However, considering the average of the absolute value of the current:

\[
I_{\text{avg}} = \frac{\text{E}_{\text{avg}}}{R} = \frac{0.04}{20} = 0.002 \, \text{A}
\]

### Part (c): Charge Passed
The charge passed during one quarter cycle is:

\[
Q = \int_{0}^{T} I(t) \, dt = \frac{N \cdot B \cdot A}{R} \cdot (1 - \cos(\omega T))
\]

For \( \omega T = \pi/2 \), \( \cos(\pi/2) = 0 \):

\[
Q = \frac{20 \cdot 0.05 \cdot 0.005}{20} = 0.00025 \, \text{C}
\]

### Final Answer:
(a) \( 0.04 \, \text{V} \), (b) \( 0.002 \, \text{A} \), (c) \( 0.00025 \, \text{C} \).
