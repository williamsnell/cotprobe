Answer the following multiple choice question, selecting from the answer A through to J. After thinking, reply directly with your answer. 

The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

Discuss the role of a stimulus that elicits a behavior pattern.

Options:

A: Stimuli can only elicit a response if they are intense
B: Stimuli intensity directly affects the animal's motivation
C: Stimuli have no influence on an animal's behavior
D: Stimuli serve as a universal language, eliciting the same behavior patterns across different species.
E: Stimuli, referred to as sign stimuli, elicit specific responses from an animal. The intensity of the stimuli necessary to evoke a behavior pattern is inversely proportional to the animal's motivation to perform that behavior.
F: Stimuli are only effective if they are novel and unfamiliar to the animal.
G: Stimuli that elicit behavior patterns are only visual; other sensory modalities do not trigger responses.
H: Stimuli are passive elements in the environment and require the animal to interpret them before eliciting a behavior pattern.
I: The animal's motivation to perform a behavior has no impact on how stimuli affect behavior patterns.
J: Stimuli must be paired with a reward to elicit any behavior pattern.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the role of a stimulus in eliciting behavior patterns. Hmm, I need to figure out which option is correct. Let me break it down.

The question is asking about the role of a stimulus. I remember from my biology classes that stimuli are the things that cause a response in an organism. So, the question is about how these stimuli work in causing behaviors.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Stimuli can only elicit a response if they are intense. Wait, I don't think that's right. Some stimuli might be weak but still effective, like a soft sound can make a baby startle, right? So intensity isn't the only factor. So A might not be correct.

Option B: Stimuli intensity directly affects motivation. Hmm, I'm not too sure. I think intensity might influence the strength of the response, but does it directly affect motivation? Maybe not. Like, a loud noise might make you jump, but does that mean you're more motivated to do something? I'm not sure. Maybe B isn't the best choice.

Option C: Stimuli have no influence on behavior. That can't be right. If that were true, then nothing would make an animal do anything, which isn't the case. So C is out.

Option D: Stimuli are a universal language, same behavior across species. No, that doesn't make sense. Different animals react differently to the same stimulus. Like, a snake's rattle affects a bird and a mouse differently. So D is incorrect.

Option E: Stimuli, sign stimuli, elicit specific responses. The intensity needed is inversely proportional to the animal's motivation. Wait, what does that mean? So if the animal is highly motivated (like really hungry), maybe a weaker stimulus would be enough to trigger the behavior. For example, a very hungry animal might start eating even if the food smell is faint. So higher motivation means less stimulus needed. That sounds familiar from what I've read about motivation and stimuli. So E could be correct.

Option F: Stimuli must be novel to be effective. No, animals respond to familiar stimuli too. Like how a dog sits when you say "sit," which is a familiar command. So F isn't correct.

Option G: Only visual stimuli work. That's not true. Animals use all sensesâ€”smell, sound, touch, etc. So G is wrong.

Option H: Stimuli are passive and require the animal to interpret. Wait, do stimuli require interpretation? I think some stimuli are direct, like pain, which triggers an immediate response without much thought. So H might not be accurate. Plus, some behaviors are reflexive, not requiring interpretation.

Option I: Motivation has no impact on how stimuli affect behavior. That seems wrong because motivation definitely influences behavior. For example, a hungry animal is more motivated to find food, so a stimulus related to food would be more effective. So I is incorrect.

Option J: Stimuli must be paired with a reward. That sounds like operant conditioning, where a reward reinforces behavior. But not all stimuli need a reward; some are intrinsic, like a predator's presence causing a flight response without any reward. So J is not correct.

So, going back, the best option seems to be E. It talks about sign stimuli, which I think are specific signals that trigger a response, and the idea that a higher motivation means a lower stimulus intensity is needed. That aligns with how motivation affects the threshold for responding to a stimulus. So I'll go with E.

The correct answer is E. Stimuli, referred to as sign stimuli, elicit specific responses from an animal. The intensity of the stimuli necessary to evoke a behavior pattern is inversely proportional to the animal's motivation to perform that behavior.

Answer: E
