Answer the following multiple choice question, selecting from the answer A through to J. After thinking, reply directly with your answer. 

The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

This question refers to the following information.
The following excerpt is from a pamphlet.
You will do me the justice to remember, that I have always strenuously supported the Right of every man to his own opinion, however different that opinion might be to mine. He who denies to another this right, makes a slave of himself to his present opinion, because he precludes himself the right of changing it.
The most formidable weapon against errors of every kind is Reason. I have never used any other, and I trust I never shall.
The circumstance that has now taken place in France of the total abolition of the whole national order of priesthood, and of everything appertaining to compulsive systems of religion, and compulsive articles of faith, has not only precipitated my intention, but rendered a work of this kind exceedingly necessary, lest in the general wreck of superstition, of false systems of government, and false theology, we lose sight of morality, of humanity, and of the theology that is true.
I believe in one God, and no more; and I hope for happiness beyond this life.
I believe in the equality of man; and I believe that religious duties consist in doing justice, loving mercy, and endeavoring to make our fellow-creatures happy.
I do not believe in the creed professed by the Jewish church, by the Roman church, by the Greek church, by the Turkish church, by the Protestant church, nor by any church that I know of. My own mind is my own church.
All national institutions of churches, whether Jewish, Christian or Turkish, appear to me no other than human inventions, set up to terrify and enslave mankind, and monopolize power and profit.
I do not mean by this declaration to condemn those who believe otherwise; they have the same right to their belief as I have to mine.
—Thomas Paine, The Age of Reason, 1794–1795

Okay, so I have this question about Thomas Paine's ideas in "The Age of Reason" and how they relate to Enlightenment intellectuals. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I'll read the excerpt again to understand Paine's main points. He starts by talking about the right of every man to his own opinion, emphasizing that denying others this right makes oneself a slave to their current opinion. He strongly supports reason as the weapon against errors. Then he mentions the abolition of the national order of priesthood in France, which I think refers to the French Revolution's impact on the Catholic Church there.

He goes on to state his personal beliefs: one God, equality of man, and that religious duties are about doing justice and loving mercy. He explicitly says he doesn't believe in any organized church—Jewish, Christian, Turkish, etc.—and refers to his own mind as his church. He criticizes national institutions of churches as human inventions meant to terrify, enslave, and monopolize power and profit. Yet, he clarifies that he's not condemning others who believe differently, acknowledging their right to their beliefs.

Now, the question asks which characteristic of Enlightenment intellectuals Paine's ideas best illustrate. The options are A through J.

Looking at the options:

A: Many promoted the idea of individual belief systems over organized religions. This seems relevant because Paine is rejecting organized churches and promoting individual reasoning and personal belief. He says his own mind is his church, which suggests an individualistic approach.

B: Most were focused on accumulating power and profit through religious institutions. That doesn't fit because Paine is criticizing religious institutions for doing exactly that, so this is the opposite.

C: Most were against equality. No, Paine explicitly supports equality, so this is incorrect.

D: Utilized salons and pamphlets. The question mentions a pamphlet, but the excerpt is from a pamphlet, so maybe this is about communication methods. However, the question is about the ideas, not the method of传播. So D might not be the best fit.

E: Believed in superiority of one religion. No, Paine rejects all creeds and doesn't promote one over others, so E is wrong.

F: New scientific discoveries solving all problems. He does mention reason and science, but the excerpt doesn't focus on scientific discoveries as solutions. So maybe not F.

G: Scientific discoveries irrelevant. Opposite of F, and Paine uses reason, which is tied to science, so G is wrong.

H: Rejected religion entirely and adopted atheism. Paine says he believes in one God, so he's not an atheist. So H isn't correct.

I: Many were scientists contributing to human understanding. The excerpt doesn't mention his scientific work, so I is not directly addressed.

J: Believed in maintaining traditional religious institutions. Paine is critical of them, so J is wrong.

So, the main points are about individual belief over organized religion and the use of reason. But the options don't have an exact match for the second part. The question is about the ideas, so the best fit is A: Many promoted individual belief systems over organized religions.

The excerpt from Thomas Paine's *The Age of Reason* emphasizes individual belief over organized religion, as Paine rejects all established churches and asserts that reason and personal judgment are paramount. He also values equality and morality, aligning with Enlightenment ideals. The best characteristic is that Enlightenment intellectuals promoted individual belief systems over organized religions.

Answer: A
