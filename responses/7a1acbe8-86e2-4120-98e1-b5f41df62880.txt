Question:

The mean ionic activity coefficient of an electrolyte in a dilute solution is given approximately by ln \gamma_\pm = - A\surd(m) where m is the molality and A is a constant. Using the Gibbs-Duhem equation find the activity coefficient \gamma_1 of the solvent in this dilute solution in terms of A, m, and constants characteristic of the solvent and solute. Ob-serve that ln X_1 = ln [(n_1) / (n_1 + mv)] = ln [(1) / {(1 + mv) / n_1}] \approx - [(mv) / (n_1)] where v is the number of ions in the formula (for example v = 2 for NaCl) and n_1 is the number of moles of solvent in 1000 g of solvent. All quantities except \gamma_1 , the un-known, can thus be expressed in terms of the variable m.

Options:

A: \gamma_1 = e[{(Av^2) / (3n_1)} m^3/2]
B: \gamma_1 = e[{(Av^2) / (2n_1)} m^3/2]
C: \gamma_1 = e[{(Av) / (3n_1)} m^3/2]
D: \gamma_1 = e[{(Av) / (3n_1^2)} m^3/2]
E: \gamma_1 = [{(Av) / (3n_1)} m^3/2]
F: \gamma_1 = [{(Av^2) / (3n_1)} m^3/2]
G: \gamma_1 = [{(A) / (n_1v)} m^3/2]
H: \gamma_1 = e[{(A) / (2n_1v^2)} m^3/2]
I: \gamma_1 = e[{(A) / (3n_1v)} m^3/2]
J: \gamma_1 = [{(Av) / (2n_1)} m^3/2]

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem about the activity coefficient of a solvent in a dilute solution using the Gibbs-Duhem equation. Let me start by understanding what's given and what's being asked.

The problem states that the mean ionic activity coefficient of an electrolyte in a dilute solution is approximated by the equation ln γ± = -A√(m), where m is the molality and A is a constant. I need to find the activity coefficient γ₁ of the solvent in terms of A, m, and constants related to the solvent and solute.

From the given information, I also notice that ln X₁ is approximated as - (mv)/(n₁), where X₁ is the mole fraction of the solvent, v is the number of ions per formula unit (like 2 for NaCl), and n₁ is the number of moles of solvent in 1000 g.

So, the first thing I recall is that the Gibbs-Duhem equation relates changes in the chemical potential of components in a solution. The equation in terms of activity coefficients is often written as:

n₁ d(ln γ₁) + v m d(ln γ±) = 0

Wait, no, let me think again. The Gibbs-Duhem equation for a binary solution (solvent and solute) is:

n₁ d(ln γ₁) + n₂ d(ln γ₂) = 0

But since we're dealing with molality and the solute is dissociated into ions, maybe it's better to express it in terms of the ionic strength or using the mean activity coefficient.

Alternatively, another form I remember is:

n₁ d(ln γ₁) + v m d(ln γ±) = 0

Because for each mole of solute, you get v ions. So, the change in the activity coefficient of the solvent (n₁) is related to the change in the mean activity coefficient of the ions (γ±).

We know from the problem that ln γ± ≈ -A√(m). So, d(ln γ±) = -A * (1/(2√(m))) dm, since the derivative of √(m) with respect to m is 1/(2√m).

Now, substituting into the Gibbs-Duhem equation:

n₁ d(ln γ₁) + v m d(ln γ±) = 0

So,

n₁ d(ln γ₁) = -v m d(ln γ±)

Plugging in d(ln γ±) = -A/(2√m) dm:

n₁ d(ln γ₁) = -v m * (-A/(2√m) dm) )

Simplify the right side:

n₁ d(ln γ₁) = (v m * A) / (2√m) dm

Simplify m / √m = √m:

n₁ d(ln γ₁) = (v A √m) / 2 dm

Now, divide both sides by n₁:

d(ln γ₁) = (v A √m) / (2 n₁) dm

Integrate both sides from m=0 to m.

The integral of d(ln γ₁) is ln γ₁, and the integral of the right side is ∫ (v A √m)/(2 n₁) dm.

So,

ln γ₁ = ∫ (v A √m) / (2 n₁) dm from 0 to m.

The integral of √m dm is (2/3) m^(3/2), so:

ln γ₁ = (v A) / (2 n₁) * (2/3) m^(3/2) + C

The constant C can be found when m=0, ln γ₁=0, so C=0.

Thus,

ln γ₁ = (v A) * (2/3) * (1/(2 n₁)) ) m^(3/2) ?

Wait, let me check the math again. When I integrate (v A / (2 n₁)) * m^(1/2) dm, the integral is (v A / (2 n₁)) * (2/3) m^(3/2) ).

So,

ln γ₁ = (v A) * (2/3) * (1/(2 n₁)) ) m^(3/2) ?

Wait, the integral is (v A)/(2 n₁) * ∫ m^(1/2) dm = (v A)/(2 n₁) * (2/3) m^(3/2) )

So,

ln γ₁ = (v A)/(2 n₁) * (2/3) m^(3/2)

Simplify: 2 cancels, so (v A)/(3 n₁) m^(3/2)

Wait that's (v A / (3 n₁)) m^(3/2)

So,

ln γ₁ = (A v m^(3/2)) / (3 n₁)

Therefore, γ₁ = e^{ (A v m^(3/2)) / (3 n₁) }

Looking at the options, option B is e^[ (A v^2)/(2 n₁) m^(3/2) ]

Option A: e^{(A v²)/(3n₁) m^{3/2}}.

Wait, let me check the options again.

Option A: e^{(A v²)/(3n₁) m^{3/2}}

Option B: e^{(A v²)/(2n₁) m^{3/2}}

Option F: e^{(A v)/(3n₁) m^{3/2}}

Wait, according to my calculation, the exponent is (A v)/(3 n₁) m^{3/2}

So, ln γ₁ = (A v)/(3 n₁) m^{3/2}

So, γ₁ = e^{(A v)/(3 n₁) m^{3/2}}

Looking at the options, that's option F: e^{(A v)/(3n₁) m^{3/2}}

Wait, but looking at the options, option F is e^[ (Av)/(3n₁) m^{3/2} ]

Yes, that's correct. So the answer should be F.

Wait, but let me double-check. Did I make any mistake in the integration?

Wait, the equation after integration is:

ln γ₁ = (v A) * (2/3) * (1/(2 n₁)) ) m^(3/2) ?

Wait, no, the integral is ∫ (v A)/(2 n₁) * m^(1/2) dm = (v A)/(2 n₁) * (2/3) m^(3/2) )

So,

ln γ₁ = (v A)/(2 n₁) * (2/3) m^(3/2) )

Which simplifies to (v A)/(3 n₁) m^(3/2)

So yes, that's correct.

Looking back at the options, option F is e^{ (Av)/(3n₁) m^{3/2} }, which matches.

Wait, but I thought the options were labeled differently. Let me check again.

Wait the options are:

A: e^{(Av²)/(3n₁) m^3/2}

B: e^{(Av²)/(2n₁) m^3/2}

C: e^{(Av)/(3n₁) m^3/2}

D: e^{(Av)/(3n₁²) m^3/2}

E: (Av/(3n₁) m^3/2) without e

F: e^{(Av)/(2n₁) m^3/2}

Wait, no, looking back:

Options:

A: e^{(Av^2)/(3n₁) m^3/2}

B: e^{(Av^2)/(2n₁) m^3/2}

C: e^{(Av)/(3n₁) m^3/2}

D: e^{(Av)/(3n₁^2) m^3/2}

E: (Av/(3n₁) m^3/2) without e (so E is not exponential)

F: e^{(Av)/(2n₁) m^3/2}

So according to that, the correct expression is (Av)/(3n₁) m^{3/2}, which is option C.

Wait, that's conflicting with my earlier conclusion. Oh wait, I think I made a mistake in the options. Let me recheck the options.

Wait, the problem lists the options as:

A: e^{(Av²)/(3n₁) m^3/2}

B: e^{(Av²)/(2n₁) m^3/2}

C: e^{(Av)/(3n₁) m^3/2}

D: e^{(Av)/(3n₁²) m^3/2}

E: (Av/(3n₁) m^3/2) without e

F: e^{(Av)/(2n₁) m^3/2}

So, from my calculation, ln γ₁ = (A v)/(3 n₁) m^{3/2} → γ₁ = e^{(A v)/(3 n₁) m^{3/2} }, which is option C.

Wait, but earlier I thought the answer was F, but that's incorrect because F has denominator 2n₁. So the correct option is C.
</think>

The activity coefficient of the solvent, γ₁, is determined using the Gibbs-Duhem equation. Starting with the given relation for the ionic activity coefficient, ln γ± = -A√(m), and the approximation for ln X₁, the equation is integrated to find ln γ₁. The integration yields ln γ₁ = (A v)/(3 n₁) m^(3/2), leading to γ₁ = e^{(A v)/(3 n₁) m^(3/2)}. This matches option C.

Answer: C
