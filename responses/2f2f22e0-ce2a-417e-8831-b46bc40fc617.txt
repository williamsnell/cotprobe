Question:

Options:

A: Mitral valve prolapse
B: Tricuspid atresia
C: Transposition of the great arteries
D: Tetralogy of Fallot
E: Atrial septal defect
F: Ventricular septal defect
G: Coarctation of the aorta
H: Mitral regurgitation
I: Aortic stenosis
J: Pulmonary stenosis

Alright, so I've got this question about a 4-year-old girl with some heart-related symptoms. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the patient is a healthy 4-year-old brought in for a well-child exam. That means she's probably asymptomatic, but they're picking up something on the physical exam. The question mentions a grade 2/6 systolic ejection murmur along the upper left sternal border. I remember that heart murmurs are graded on intensity, with 1 being very faint and 6 being very loud with a thrill. A grade 2 is moderate.

Ejection murmurs are typically associated with conditions that affect the outflow from the ventricles. Systolic murmurs happen during contraction, so that points towards issues like stenosis or maybe a defect that causes increased blood flow. The location is the upper left sternal border, which is where the aortic valve is best heard. So maybe aortic stenosis? Or perhaps something else.

Then, it says S2 is widely split and doesn't vary with respiration. S2 is the sound of the pulmonary and aortic valves closing. A widely split S2 usually suggests a delay in the closure of one of the valves. If it's the aortic valve closure that's delayed, that could indicate a problem with the left ventricle's ability to eject blood, like aortic stenosis. If it's the pulmonary valve, maybe a right ventricular issue. But since the split is wide and not varying with respiration, which normally affects the S2 in certain conditions, like when there's increased blood flow to the lungs or something.

Next, there's a soft mid-diastolic murmur along the lower left sternal border. Mid-diastolic murmurs are often associated with mitral or tricuspid valve issues. Lower left sternal border is where the mitral valve is heard. A mid-diastolic murmur could be due to prolapse or perhaps some other mitral issue. But it's soft, so maybe not as severe.

Looking at the options:

A: Mitral valve prolapse – could cause a click-murmur, mid-diastolic. But in a 4-year-old, that's less common. Usually, MVP is more common in older kids or adults.

B: Tricuspid atresia – that's a severe congenital defect where the tricuspid valve doesn't form, leading to a single chamber on the right. This would cause significant cyanosis and other issues, probably not a well child.

C: Transposition of the great arteries (TGA) – this is a cyanotic heart disease where the aorta and pulmonary artery are switched. They usually present with signs of low oxygen, like bluish skin. The physical exam would show signs like weak pulses and wide split S2. But the S2 doesn't vary with respiration here, which in TGA might not change much because of the altered physiology.

D: Tetralogy of Fallot – a combination of defects: pulmonary stenosis, overriding aorta, VSD, and right ventricular hypertrophy. It presents with cyanosis and a harsh systolic murmur. But in this case, the ejection murmur is grade 2, not harsh. Also, the S2 is split, which might not fit as well.

E: Atrial septal defect (ASD) – this is a hole in the atrial septum. It can cause a innocent-sounding murmur, often systolic along the lower left sternal border. But the S2 in ASD might be normal or have a delayed aortic closure if there's increased preload. However, the ejection murmur at upper left sternal border doesn't fit as well here.

F: Ventricular septal defect (VSD) – a hole in the ventricular septum. It often causes a holosystolic (pan-systolic) murmur at the lower left sternal border. But here, the ejection murmur is in a different location, so maybe not VSD.

G: Coarctation of the aorta – causes a systolic ejection murmur along the upper right sternal border, not left. Also, there might be a delayed radial pulse if it's more severe. But the location here is upper left, so probably not.

H: Mitral regurgitation – this would cause a pansystolic murmur at the lower left sternal border. The ejection murmur is elsewhere, so maybe not.

I: Aortic stenosis – causes a harsh ejection murmur along the upper left sternal border, which matches the first murmur. The S2 being widely split could be due to delayed aortic closure because of increased afterload, making the aortic valve close later. The mid-diastolic murmur is a bit confusing, though. Maybe it's innocent or due to a small issue elsewhere.

J: Pulmonary stenosis – causes a ejection murmur along the lower left sternal border. But in this case, the ejection is at upper left, so probably not.

Putting it together: The ejection murmur at upper left suggests aortic stenosis. The mid-diastolic murmur could be a finding in some cases, perhaps due to an associated bicuspid aortic valve, which might have a click or a murmur. The S2 is widely split, which in aortic stenosis could happen if the aortic valve closes later because of increased pressure, causing the pulmonic valve to close first, leading to a wide split. 

So the most likely diagnosis is I: Aortic stenosis.

The most likely diagnosis is **I: Aortic stenosis**. The grade 2/6 systolic ejection murmur along the upper left sternal border and the widely split S2 suggest aortic stenosis, where delayed aortic valve closure causes the split. The mid-diastolic murmur may be associated with a bicuspid aortic valve.

Answer: I
