Question:

A vacationer, on a winter ski holiday, visited a ski lift in a private park. The ski lift company had installed and operated the lift pursuant to a concession agreement with the owner of the private park. Visitors gained entry to the park on payment of a $5 fee, which entitled them to go ice skating, tobogganing, or sledding. A ski lift ticket cost an additional $7 per day. At the top of the ski lift, there was a platform for embarking and disembarking passengers. The ski lift company paid the owner a stipulated rental plus 15 percent of the net proceeds from the lift. Two employees of the company operated the lift, one from a station at the bottom and the other from a station at the top of the hill. When the vacationer boarded the ski lift, it was late afternoon and most of the skiers had left. He was the sole passenger on the lift. Meanwhile, the employee at the top had left his post to go to the bathroom, asking his friend to keep watch on the lift and to stop it to allow any passengers to disembark. The friend consented, and the employee showed him how to use the control switch. When the vacationer approached the top, the employee was still away. Instead of stopping the lift to permit the vacationer to get off, the friend allowed the lift to keep moving. The vacationer was carried past the platform, and he was swung violently from side to side as the ski lift started downward. When the employee returned and sized up the situation, he threw the switch, stopping the lift. The vacationer, severely bruised and badly frightened, jumped off the ski lift and completed his descent by foot. In a personal injury action by the vacationer against the owner of the private park, the vacationer will rely on the concept of

Options:

A: vicarious liability.
B: negligence per se.
C: imputed negligence.
D: comparative negligence.
E: assumption of risk.
F: joint venture.
G: strict liability.
H: premises liability.
I: respondeat superior.
J: contributory negligence.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this legal question about a vacationer who got injured on a ski lift. Let's break it down step by step.

First, I need to understand the scenario. The vacationer paid a fee to enter the park and an extra fee for the ski lift. The ski lift is operated by a company under a concession agreement with the park owner. So, the park owner isn't directly running the lift but has a company doing it.

The incident happened when the vacationer was the only passenger. The top employee went to the bathroom, leaving his friend to watch the lift. The friend didn't stop the lift when the vacationer arrived, causing him to be swung violently and injured.

Now, the question is about which legal concept the vacationer will rely on in his personal injury action against the park owner.

Looking at the options, I need to consider the possible legal theories. Let's go through them one by one.

Option A: Vicarious liability. That's when one party is held liable for the actions of another, usually an employee. So if the friend was an employee of the ski lift company, the company could be liable, but the question is about the park owner.

Option B: Negligence per se. That's when a statute is violated, and that violation is treated as negligence. Not sure if any statute was broken here.

Option C: Imputed negligence. This is when the negligence of one party is attributed to another, usually in cases of joint employment or something. Maybe if the ski lift company is considered an agent of the park owner.

Option D: Comparative negligence. This deals with how the injured party's own negligence contributes to the injury. The vacationer here seems to be a passenger, so maybe not directly applicable.

Option E: Assumption of risk. If the vacationer knew the risks and voluntarily took them, the owner might not be liable. But the facts don't indicate he assumed the risk of improper operation.

Option F: Joint venture. This is about shared business ventures. Not sure if the park owner and ski company are in a joint venture here.

Option G: Strict liability. This applies when certain activities are considered dangerous, and liability is strict regardless of fault. Ski lifts are generally not strictly liable; it's more about negligence.

Option H: Premises liability. This is when the owner of a property is liable for injuries on their premises. The park owns the land, and the ski lift is on the premises. So if the owner failed to ensure safe conditions, they could be liable.

Option I: Respondeat superior. This is another term for vicarious liability, where the employer is liable for the employee's actions. So similar to option A.

Option J: Contributory negligence. If the injured party was also negligent, they might be partially at fault. But the vacationer was just a passenger; it's unclear if he contributed.

So, focusing on the park owner. The ski lift is operated by a concessionaire, but the park still owns the premises. The duty of care would lie with the owner to ensure that the concessionaire operates safely. If the friend's actions (not stopping the lift) were negligent, and the park owner is responsible for the operation, then premises liability (H) might apply. Alternatively, vicarious liability or respondeat superior could be if the friend was an employee, making the ski company liable, but the question is against the park owner.

Another angle: the park owner is responsible for the activities on their property. If the ski lift's operation was their concession, they might be liable under premises liability if they failed to ensure safe conditions. So the vacationer would argue that the owner didn't properly oversee the lift's operation, leading to his injury.

I'm leaning towards premises liability, which is option H.

The correct answer is H: premises liability. The park owner is responsible for the premises, and the ski lift, operated under a concession, is part of the premises. The owner has a duty to ensure safe conditions, and the injured party can argue the owner failed in that duty.

H
