Okay, so I have this genetics problem here about color blindness. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I remember that color blindness is a sex-linked trait, specifically recessive, and it's usually on the X chromosome. So, males have only one X, and females have two. 

The question says there are 2,000 individuals in total—1,000 males and 1,000 females. Out of the males, 90 are color blind. I need to find out what percentage of the women are phenotypically normal.

Wait, phenotypically normal means they don't show the trait, right? So for females, since they have two X chromosomes, they need to have at least one normal allele to be phenotypically normal. If both Xs have the recessive 'd' gene, then they would be color blind. But if at least one is normal (let's say 'D'), they won't show the condition.

First, let's think about the males. Males get their X from their mother and Y from their father. Since the condition is recessive, a male only needs one 'd' to be color blind. So the 90 color-blind males must have the genotype 'dY'. 

Let me calculate the frequency of the 'd' allele in the population, but wait, maybe I should approach it differently since we're dealing with a sample. So for males: number of color-blind = 90 out of 1,000. That means 90% of males are color blind. Wait no, 90 out of 1,000 is 9%. So 9% of males are color-blind. 

Since males only need one 'd' to be affected, the frequency of the 'd' allele in the male population must be 9%. Wait, but males contribute their X (with 'd') to their daughters and Y to sons. But maybe I should look at the females' Xs. 

Wait, perhaps I should model this with Hardy-Weinberg equations. But since it's a sex-linked trait, it's a bit different. Let me think: in females, the possible genotypes are DD, Dd, and dd. Phenotypically, DD and Dd are normal, while dd is color blind.

So, the problem is about finding the percentage of females who are normal, i.e., not color blind. So, I need to find how many females are not color blind. How do I find that?

Wait, but the problem doesn't give the number of color blind females directly. So maybe I can use the information from the males to find the allele frequency and then apply it to the females.

In males, the color blind ones have genotype 'dY'. So the number of 'd' alleles contributed by the males is 90 (since each has one 'd' allele). Wait, no: each color-blind male has one 'd' on their X. So 90 males have 'd', so the number of 'd' alleles from males is 90. 

But wait, the total number of X chromosomes in the population comes from both parents. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think: the frequency of the 'd' allele in the population can be calculated based on the males, and then use that to find the frequency in females.

So, in the male population: 90 are color blind, so their X is 'd'. So 90 males have 'd', so the allele frequency 'q' for 'd' in the X chromosomes of males is 90/1000 = 0.09. So q = 0.09, and p = 1 - q = 0.91. 

But wait, but females get one X from each parent. So the 'd' allele frequency in the population's X chromosomes would be the same as the male's, since males contribute their X to daughters and Y to sons. So the frequency of 'd' is 9%, so q = 0.09.

Now, applying this to females. Each female has two Xs: one from each parent. So for each X, the chance of being 'd' is 0.09, and 'D' is 0.91.

In females, the probability of being color blind (dd) is q², which is 0.09² = 0.0081, or 0.81%. So the probability of being phenotypically normal (either DD or Dd) is 1 - 0.0081 = 0.9919, which is about 99.19%. 

Wait, but let me double-check. Since each X is independent, the probability a female has 'd' on both Xs is (0.09) * (0.09) = 0.0081, as I said. So the number of color-blind females would be 0.0081 * 1000 = 8.1. But the question is about the percentage of women who are phenotypically normal, which is 100% - 0.81% = 99.19%, approximately 99.2%. 

Looking at the options, option B is 99 percent. That seems right. But wait, another approach: maybe I should calculate the expected number of color-blind females based on the allele frequency and then compute the percentage of normal females.

So, the number of color-blind females would be 1000 * (0.09)^2 = 1000 * 0.0081 = 8.1. So, approximately 8 females are color blind. So, the number of normal females would be 1000 - 8 = 992. 992/1000 = 99.2%, which rounds to 99%, so option B.

Wait, but I'm making an assumption here that the allele frequencies are the same in both males and females, which might not be strictly accurate because females contribute two Xs, but perhaps the problem assumes Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium for the X chromosome in the population. 

Alternatively, perhaps the approach is to find the number of women who have at least one 'D' allele, which would be 1 - (probability of having two 'd's). Since each X has a 9% chance of being 'd', the chance of both being 'd' is 0.09 * 0.09 = 0.0081, so 0.81% are color blind, 99.19% are normal.

So the answer should be B: 99 percent.

The problem involves determining the percentage of women who are phenotypically normal for a sex-linked recessive trait (color blindness). Color blindness is caused by the recessive allele 'd' on the X chromosome. Males have one X chromosome, while females have two. Phenotypically normal females have at least one dominant 'D' allele, meaning they can have genotypes 'DD' or 'Dd'. Color-blind females have the genotype 'dd'.

Given that 90 out of 1,000 males are color blind, the frequency of the 'd' allele (q) in the population is calculated as 90/1,000 = 0.09. Since the allele frequency is the same for both males and females, the probability of a female inheriting 'd' on each X chromosome is 0.09. The probability of a female being color blind ('dd') is therefore \( q^2 = 0.09^2 = 0.0081 \) or 0.81%. Consequently, the probability of a female being phenotypically normal (not color blind) is \( 1 - 0.0081 = 0.9919 \) or 99.19%, which rounds to 99%.

Thus, the percentage of women who are phenotypically normal is **99 percent**.
