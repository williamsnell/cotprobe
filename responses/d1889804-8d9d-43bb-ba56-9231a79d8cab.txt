Question:

Random variable X is normally distributed, with a mean of 25 and a standard deviation of 4. Which of the following is the approximate interquartile range for this distribution?

Options:

A: 2.00(25.00) = 50.00
B: 25.00 ÷ 4.00 = 6.25
C: 25.00 + 22.30 = 47.30
D: 2.00(4.00) = 8.00
E: 27.70 – 25.00 = 2.70
F: 27.70 – 22.30 = 5.40
G: 27.70 + 22.30 = 50.00
H: 27.70 ÷ 22.30 = 1.24
I: 4.00^2 = 16.00
J: 25.00 – 22.30 = 2.70

Okay, so I've got this question about a normally distributed random variable X. The mean is 25, and the standard deviation is 4. The question is asking for the approximate interquartile range. Hmm, interquartile range is the difference between the third quartile (Q3) and the first quartile (Q1), right? So IQR = Q3 - Q1.

Since it's a normal distribution, I remember that the quartiles are symmetric around the mean. I think the key here is to find the values of Q1 and Q3. I recall that in a normal distribution, Q1 is approximately at the mean minus 0.6745 standard deviations, and Q3 is at the mean plus the same amount. So that's because the interquartile range covers the middle 50% of the data, and those points are roughly 0.6745 standard deviations away from the mean on each side.

So let me calculate Q1 and Q3. 

First, Q1: Mean is 25, standard deviation is 4. So Q1 = 25 - (0.6745 * 4). Let me compute 0.6745 * 4. Hmm, 0.67 *4 is about 2.68, and 0.0045*4 is 0.018, so total is approximately 2.698. So Q1 is 25 - 2.698, which is roughly 22.302.

Similarly, Q3 is 25 + (0.6745 *4). Using the same calculation, that's 25 + 2.698, which is about 27.698.

Now, the interquartile range is Q3 - Q1. So that's approximately 27.698 - 22.302. Let me subtract that: 27.7 minus 22.3 is about 5.4. So the IQR is roughly 5.4.

Looking at the options, I need to find which one matches this. Let's go through the options:

A: 2.00 *25.00 = 50.00 → That's way too big.
B: 25.00 ÷4.00=6.25 → Close, but not exactly what I calculated.
C: 25.00 +22.30=47.30 → That's adding, not subtracting, so not the IQR.
D:2.00*4.00=8.00 → No, that's 8, higher than our 5.4.
E:27.70 –25.00=2.70 → That's just the distance from mean to Q3, not the IQR.
F:27.70 –22.30=5.40 → Oh, that's exactly what I got.
G:27.70 +22.30=50.00 → Again, adding, not the IQR.
H:27.70 ÷22.30=1.24 → Not relevant.
I:4.00^2=16.00 → That's variance, not IQR.
J:25.00–22.30=2.70 → Same as E, just mean to Q1.

So the correct answer must be option F, which is 5.40.

The interquartile range (IQR) for a normal distribution is calculated by finding the difference between the third quartile (Q3) and the first quartile (Q1). For a normal distribution, Q1 is approximately at the mean minus 0.6745 standard deviations, and Q3 is at the mean plus the same amount. With a mean of 25 and a standard deviation of 4, Q1 is approximately 22.30 and Q3 is approximately 27.70. Subtracting these gives an IQR of 5.40, which corresponds to option F.

Answer: F
