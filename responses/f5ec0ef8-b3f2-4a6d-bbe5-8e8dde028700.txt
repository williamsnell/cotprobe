Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about whether the human appendix is a completely vestigial organ. The question is asking which statement most detracts from that claim. Let's break it down step by step.

First, I need to understand what a vestigial organ is. From what I remember, a vestigial organ is a part of the body that has lost its original function through evolution. It might have had a purpose in an ancestor but is now mostly non-functional in the current species. So, if the question is about whether the appendix is completely vestigial, the correct answer would be the statement that suggests it still has a function.

The options are A through J. I'll go through each one to see which supports or contradicts the idea that the appendix is vestigial.

Option A: The size of the appendix varies greatly among individuals. Hmm, variation in size doesn't necessarily indicate whether it's vestigial. It just means that individuals differ, but that doesn't say much about function. So this might not be the best answer.

Option B: Individuals with a larger-than-average appendix leave fewer offspring. Wait, that's interesting. If larger appendices are linked to fewer offspring, maybe it suggests the appendix isn't beneficial, but does that mean it's vestigial? Or does it imply that it's harmful? I'm not sure. It might not directly address functionality but rather reproductive success. Maybe not the main point.

Option C: The appendix is located near the large intestine. That's just describing its position. Location doesn't indicate function, so this probably doesn't affect the vestigial claim.

Option D: The appendix is not present in all mammal species. Well, many organs aren't present in all species, but that doesn't mean they're vestigial. For example, humans have eyes, but not all mammals do, but eyes aren't vestigial. So this might not be the right choice.

Option E: The appendix can be surgically removed with no immediate ill effects. This is a common fact because people often have their appendix removed without major issues. However, this doesn't mean the appendix has no function. It just means it's not immediately necessary. So this could support the idea that it's vestigial, but maybe there's a better option.

Option F: The appendix might have been larger in fossil hominids. This suggests that it was bigger in the past, which is often a sign of a vestigial structure. So this might actually support the idea that the appendix is vestigial, not detract from it.

Option G: The appendix has a substantial amount of defensive lymphatic tissue. Oh, this is interesting. Lymphatic tissue is part of the immune system. So if the appendix has a lot of that, maybe it serves a function in the immune response. This would suggest it's not vestigial, which would detract from the claim. So this is a strong candidate.

Option H: The appendix is often inflamed in cases of appendicitis. Appendicitis happens when the appendix gets infected, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's non-functional. In fact, if it's inflamed, it suggests it's active, so maybe it's still serving a purpose. But the inflammation itself isn't proof of function; it's just a medical condition. So maybe not the best option.

Option I: Many people live healthy lives without an appendix after it's been removed. Similar to option E, this shows that the appendix isn't essential, but again, that doesn't mean it's completely without function. People can live without it, but that doesn't negate any possible function it might have.

Option J: The appendix has no known function in digestion. If the appendix isn't involved in digestion, that's a point towards it being vestigial, assuming its original function was in digestion. But wait, the question is about whether it's completely vestigial. If it has no known digestive function, maybe it does something else, like the immune system role mentioned in G. So this might not be the best answer because it's about lack of digestive function, not necessarily the presence of another function.

So, putting it all together, the statement that most detracts from the claim that the appendix is completely vestigial would be the one that suggests it has a current function. Option G says it has a lot of defensive lymphatic tissue, which implies an immune function. This would mean the appendix isn't vestigial because it serves a purpose now. 

Wait, but let me think again. The question is about which statement most detracts from the claim that the appendix is completely vestigial. So if G is correct, it would show the appendix isn't vestigial. But the question is asking which statement detracts from the claim, meaning which supports that it's not entirely vestigial. Therefore, G is the correct answer.

The statement that most detracts from the claim that the human appendix is a completely vestigial organ is **G**, as it suggests the appendix has a functional role in the immune system through its lymphatic tissue.

**Answer: G**
