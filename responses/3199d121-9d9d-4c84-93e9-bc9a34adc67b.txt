Okay, so I've got this question about earnings per share (EPS), and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me start by recalling what EPS means. From what I remember, EPS is a financial metric that shows a company's profitability per share of stock. It's calculated by dividing the net profit available to common shareholders by the number of outstanding shares.

The question says the company has a profit to common shareholders of $4,750 and there are 1,000 shares outstanding. So, to find EPS, I think I just divide the profit by the number of shares.

Let me write that down: EPS = Net Profit / Number of Shares. So plugging in the numbers, that would be $4,750 divided by 1,000. Hmm, doing the division... 4,750 divided by 1,000. Well, dividing by 1,000 moves the decimal point three places to the left, so that would be $4.75. 

Wait, does that make sense? Let me double-check. If there are 1,000 shares and the total profit is $4,750, each share would get $4.75. Yeah, that seems right. So looking at the options, option D is $4.75, which should be the correct answer.

The earnings per share (EPS) is calculated by dividing the net profit available to common shareholders by the number of outstanding shares. Here, the profit is $4,750 and the shares are 1,000. So, EPS = $4,750 / 1,000 = $4.75. 

Answer: D
