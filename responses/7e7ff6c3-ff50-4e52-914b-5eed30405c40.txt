Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how much Smith can deduct from his rental real estate losses. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the question says Smith has an adjusted gross income (AGI) of $120,000. But this doesn't include $40,000 of losses from rental real estate activities. So normally, without any other considerations, he would have an AGI that's $40k less, but the question is about the deductibility of these losses.

Smith actively participates in these rental activities. I remember that for rental real estate, there are limits on how much loss you can deduct each year. I think it's something called the "passive activity loss" limit, but wait, since he's actively participating, maybe that changes things.

Wait, no. Passive activity losses are for when you're not actively involved. But since Smith is actively participating, maybe the rules are different. Let me recall the rules.

I think the general rule is that you can deduct up to $25,000 of losses from real estate activities if you actively participate, but this deduction is phased out if your income exceeds certain limits.

So the formula for the deduction is: the lesser of the loss amount or $25,000, but only if your income is below a certain threshold. If your income is above that, the deduction is phased out.

Wait, the phase-out for the $25,000 deduction starts when your income is between 100k and 150k, right? So the deduction is reduced by 50% of the amount by which your AGI exceeds $100,000, up to a maximum phase-out of $25,000.

So in this case, Smith's AGI is $120k. The phase-out threshold is from $100k to $150k. So the excess is $20k ($120k - $100k). The phase-out reduces the deduction by 50% of that excess, so 50% of 20k is 10k. So the maximum deduction allowed is $25k minus 10k, which is $15k.

But wait, the rental loss in question is $40k. So the allowed deduction can't exceed $15k because of the phase-out. Also, the other option is that the maximum deduction is $25k, but if the phase-out brings it lower, then that's the limit.

So Smith's AGI is $120k, so the allowable deduction is $15k. Therefore, the answer should be $15,000, which is option A.

The allowable deduction is calculated based on the phase-out rules for active participation in rental real estate. Since Smith's AGI is $120,000, which exceeds the $100,000 threshold, the deduction is reduced by 50% of the excess ($20,000), resulting in a $15,000 deduction.
