Question:

Data were collected on two variables X and Y and a least squares regression line was fitted to the data. The estimated equation for this data is y = –2.29 + 1.70x. One point has x = 5, y = 6. What is the residual for this point?

Options:

A: 1.70
B: –0.21
C: -6.21
D: -5.00
E: –1.70
F: -7.91
G: 5.00
H: 7.91
I: 0.21
J: 6.21

Okay, so I've got this question about regression lines and residuals. I'm a bit rusty on statistics, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says that there's a regression line equation y = –2.29 + 1.70x. So, I remember that in regression, the equation is usually in the form y = a + bx, where a is the intercept and b is the slope. That matches what's given here.

Now, there's a data point with x=5 and y=6. The question is asking for the residual for this point. Hmm, residuals. Right, residuals are the difference between the observed y value and the predicted y value from the regression line. So, residual = observed y - predicted y.

So, I need to find the predicted y when x is 5. Let's plug x=5 into the equation.

Predicted y = -2.29 + 1.70*(5). Let me calculate that. 1.70 times 5 is 8.5. Then, subtract 2.29: 8.5 - 2.29. Let me do that subtraction. 8.5 is the same as 8.50, so 8.50 minus 2.29 equals... 6.21. Because 8 minus 2 is 6, and 0.50 minus 0.29 is 0.21, so 6.21.

So, the predicted y when x is 5 is 6.21. The actual y is 6. So, the residual is 6 (observed) minus 6.21 (predicted). Wait, no, wait. Which way around is it? I think it's observed minus predicted. So, 6 - 6.21.

Let me calculate that: 6.00 minus 6.21. That would be negative 0.21. Because 6 is less than 6.21. So, 6 - 6.21 = -0.21.

Looking at the options, option I is -0.21. So that's the residual. Alternatively, option B is -0.21 as well. Wait, let me check the options again.

Wait, the options are A: 1.70, B: –0.21, C: -6.21, D: -5.00, E: –1.70, F: -7.91, G: 5.00, H: 7.91, I: 0.21, J: 6.21.

Wait, option B is -0.21, which is what I got. So that's the answer. Alternatively, I thought I was looking for option I, which is 0.21, but that's positive. But since I calculated -0.21, option B is correct.

Wait, did I get the order right? So residual is observed minus predicted. So, y_observed is 6, y_predicted is 6.21. 6 - 6.21 is indeed -0.21. So yes, option B is the correct answer.

The residual is calculated as the observed y minus the predicted y. For x=5, the predicted y is 6.21, so the residual is 6 - 6.21 = -0.21.

Answer: B
