Okay, so I have this problem where I need to figure out the cost per pound to transport merchandise over different distances. The question says that it costs $5.00 to transport one pound 100 miles and $28.50 for 700 miles. It also mentions that the relationship is linear, so I should model this with a linear equation.

First, I think about what a linear relationship looks like. It's usually in the form y = mx + b, where y is the cost, x is the distance, m is the slope (or rate), and b is the y-intercept. But wait, in this case, does the cost have a fixed component, or is it purely based on distance? I'm not sure yet, so I'll assume it's linear without any fixed costs beyond the per-mile rate. So maybe it's y = m*x, where m is the cost per mile.

Wait, no, actually, since it's per pound, maybe the total cost is per pound per mile. So, perhaps the cost per pound increases with distance. Let me clarify: for each pound, the cost depends on how far you're transporting it. So, for one pound, 100 miles costs $5, and 700 miles costs $28.50. So the cost per pound increases by a fixed amount per mile.

Let me set up the data points. For 100 miles, cost is $5, and for 700 miles, it's $28.50. So I can treat this as two points: (100, 5) and (700, 28.5). Wait, no, that's not quite right because the cost is per pound. So each point is (distance, cost per pound). Wait, no, actually, the cost given is for one pound, so yes, (100 miles, $5) and (700 miles, $28.50) are the two points.

So I can find the slope (rate) between these two points. The slope m would be (change in cost)/(change in distance). So m = (28.50 - 5) / (700 - 100) = (23.5)/(600) = let me calculate that. 23.5 divided by 600. Let's see, 23.5 ÷ 600. 600 goes into 23.5 about 0.0391666... times. So m ≈ 0.0391666 dollars per mile per pound.

Wait, but that seems very small. Let me check the calculation again. 28.50 minus 5 is 23.50. 700 minus 100 is 600. So 23.50 / 600. Let me do it more accurately: 23.5 ÷ 600 = 0.0391666... dollars per mile. So that's about 3.91666 cents per mile per pound.

But wait, let's think about the total cost. If the cost per mile is $0.0391666 per pound, then for 100 miles, it would be 100 * 0.0391666 = 3.91666 dollars per pound, but the given cost is $5 for 100 miles. That doesn't add up. Hmm, so maybe I'm making a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps I should model the total cost as a linear function of miles, not per pound. Wait, the problem says "cost per pound to transport merchandise." So maybe the total cost is per pound, so the function is cost per pound as a function of miles. So for each pound, the cost depends on the distance.

So, let me think again. The two data points are (100, 5) and (700, 28.5). So x is the distance in miles, and y is the cost per pound. So I can find the equation y = mx + b, where m is the slope, and b is the y-intercept.

Calculating the slope m: (28.5 - 5) / (700 - 100) = 23.5 / 600 = 0.0391666... per mile. So m ≈ 0.0391667.

Now, using one of the points to find b. Let's take (100, 5). So 5 = 0.0391667 * 100 + b. 0.0391667 * 100 = 3.9166667. So 5 = 3.9166667 + b → b = 5 - 3.9166667 = 1.0833333.

So the equation is y = 0.0391667x + 1.0833333.

Now, let's check if this works for the second point. For x=700: y = 0.0391667 * 700 + 1.0833333. 0.0391667 * 700 = approx 27.4166667. Adding 1.0833333 gives 28.5, which matches. So the equation is correct.

Wait, but wait a second. If the cost per pound is y = 0.0391667x + 1.0833333, then for x=200 miles, y would be 0.0391667*200 + 1.0833333 = 7.83334 + 1.0833333 ≈ 8.91667 dollars. Similarly, for 400 miles, it's 0.0391667*400 + 1.0833333 = 15.66668 + 1.0833333 ≈ 16.75 dollars.

Looking at the options, option A is $8.90 and $16.70, which is very close to my calculations. But wait, perhaps I should consider if the cost includes a fixed cost plus a per-mile charge, or if it's purely per-mile. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait another thought: perhaps the problem is asking for the total cost per pound, which includes a fixed cost plus a variable cost per mile. So yes, the equation is correct as y = 0.0391667x + 1.0833333. But let me check the problem statement again. It says "the cost of transportation and mileage is linear." So perhaps the cost is linear in terms of distance, but it's per pound. So the per-pound cost increases with distance.

Wait, but the way the problem is phrased: "It costs $5.00 to transport one pound of merchandise 100 miles..." So that's $5 per pound for 100 miles, and $28.50 per pound for 700 miles. So yes, the per-pound cost increases with distance. So the equation I derived is correct.

So using that equation, for 200 miles: y = 0.0391667 * 200 + 1.0833333.

Calculating 0.0391667 * 200: 0.0391667 * 200 = 7.83334. Adding 1.0833333 gives 8.91667, which is approximately $8.92. But the option A is $8.90 and $16.70. Hmm, close but not exact. Let me check the calculations again.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate it more precisely without rounding too early.

Let me recalculate m: 23.5 / 600 exactly.

23.5 divided by 600.

23.5 / 600 = (47/2) / 600 = 47/(2*600) = 47/1200 ≈ 0.0391666667.

Now, using this m, let's compute y at x=200:

y = (47/1200)*200 + b.

(47/1200)*200 = (47 * 200)/1200 = (9400)/1200 = 94/12 = 7.833333333.

Then, b was found as 5 - (47/1200)*100. Let me compute that without decimal approximations.

(47/1200)*100 = 4700/1200 = 47/12 ≈ 3.916666667.

So b = 5 - 47/12 = (60/12 - 47/12) = 13/12 ≈ 1.083333333.

So y at 200 miles is 7.833333333 + 1.083333333 = 8.916666666, which is $8.916666666, approximately $8.92.

Similarly, for 400 miles:

y = (47/1200)*400 + 13/12.

(47/1200)*400 = (47*400)/1200 = (18800)/1200 = 188/12 ≈15.66666667.

Adding 13/12 (≈1.083333333) gives 15.66666667 + 1.083333333 ≈16.75 dollars.

Looking at the options, option A is $8.90 and $16.70, which is very close to my calculated $8.92 and $16.75. But the options have exact numbers, so perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the cost is a linear function of distance, but without a fixed cost. So perhaps y = m*x, where m is the cost per mile per pound. Let me try that.

If y = m*x, then using the two points (100,5) and (700,28.5), the slope m would be (28.5 -5)/(700-100) = 23.5/600 = 0.039166667 per mile.

Then, for 200 miles, y = 0.039166667 *200 = 7.83333334, which is about $7.83. But none of the options have $7.83 for 200 miles. Wait, looking at the options, option G is $7.80 and $15.60, which is close but not exact. But since the problem says it's linear, maybe I should consider that there's a fixed cost, which I included earlier.

Wait, but in the earlier approach, I included a fixed cost. So perhaps the correct answer is option A, $8.90 and $16.70, which is close to $8.92 and $16.75.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of linear cost per pound, which could include a fixed base cost plus a variable cost per mile. Let me double-check the equation.

Another way: Let's consider that the cost function is y = mx + b. We have two points:

For x=100, y=5: 5 = 100m + b.

For x=700, y=28.5: 28.5 = 700m + b.

Subtracting the first equation from the second: 28.5 -5 = (700m +b) - (100m +b) → 23.5 = 600m → m=23.5/600=0.039166667.

Then, substituting m into first equation: 5 =100*(0.039166667) + b →5=3.91666667 +b →b=5-3.91666667=1.08333333.

So equation is y=0.039166667x +1.08333333.

So for x=200: y=0.039166667*200 +1.08333333=7.83333334 +1.08333333=8.91666667 ≈8.92.

Similarly, x=400: y=0.039166667*400 +1.08333333=15.66666668 +1.08333333=16.75.

Looking at the options, the closest is option A: $8.90 and $16.70.

But perhaps the problem expects rounding to the nearest cent, so 8.91666667 is $8.92, but option A has $8.90. Alternatively, perhaps the cost function doesn't include the fixed cost. Wait, if I assume that the cost is purely based on distance, without a fixed cost, then y = m*x.

So m=23.5/600=0.039166667 per mile.

Then for x=200: y=7.83333334, which is $7.83. Similarly, x=400: y=15.6666667, $15.67.

Looking at the options, option G is $7.80 and $15.60, which is close but not exact.

But the problem says the relationship is linear. So including a fixed cost makes sense because when x=0, the cost would be b=1.0833, which is a fixed cost. So that seems more accurate.

But why is the option A $8.90 and $16.70? Let me check the calculations again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup. Let me think differently: maybe the cost is per pound, and the total cost is per pound. So the cost function is y = m*x + b, where y is cost per pound, x is miles. So with two points (100,5) and (700,28.5), we calculated m=0.039166667 and b=1.08333333.

So for 200 miles: y=0.039166667*200 +1.08333333=7.83333334 +1.08333333=8.91666667.

So that's $8.92, but option A is $8.90. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects us to find the cost per mile first, then multiply by the distance, without a fixed cost.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the cost per mile is calculated as (28.50 -5)/(700-100) =23.5/600=0.039166667 per mile per pound.

Then, for 200 miles: 200 * 0.039166667=7.83333334, which is $7.83. But that's not matching any options except G, which is $7.80 and $15.60.

Wait, but the problem says the cost is $5.00 for 100 miles and $28.50 for 700 miles. So perhaps the cost includes a fixed setup fee, plus a per-mile cost. So maybe the per-mile cost is m, and the total cost is m*x + b.

But in this case, the per-pound cost increases with distance, which is why it's linear.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to model the total cost as a linear function, but per pound. So for one pound, the cost is y = m*x + b.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is about the total cost, not per pound. Let me re-read the question.

The question says: "It costs $5.00 to transport one pound of merchandise 100 miles and $28.50 to transport one pound of merchandise 700 miles." So yes, it's per pound.

So the function is y = m*x + b, where y is cost per pound, x is miles. So my earlier approach is correct.

So the function is y = 0.039166667x + 1.08333333.

So for 200 miles: y=8.91666667, which is approximately $8.92. The closest option is A: $8.90 and $16.70. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects rounding to the nearest tenth, so 8.92 would round to $8.90, and 16.75 would round to $16.80, but option A has $16.70. Hmm, that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the fixed cost. Let me recalculate b.

From the first point: 5 = 0.039166667*100 + b → 5=3.91666667 +b → b=5-3.91666667=1.08333333, which is correct.

Another thought: perhaps the problem is intended to have a cost that's directly proportional to distance, without a fixed cost. So y = m*x. Let's see what m would be.

If y=5 when x=100, then m=5/100=0.05 per mile. Then for 700 miles, y=0.05*700=35, but the given cost is 28.50, which doesn't match. So that can't be right.

Alternatively, maybe the cost includes a fixed cost per pound, regardless of distance. But that would make the relationship affine, not purely linear. So the earlier approach is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should check if the function is correctly calculated. Let me see:

At 100 miles: y = 0.039166667*100 +1.08333333=3.91666667 +1.08333333=5. Correct.

At 700 miles: y=0.039166667*700 +1.08333333=27.41666669 +1.08333333=28.50. Correct.

So the function is correct.

Thus, for 200 miles: y=8.91666667≈8.92, and for 400 miles: y=16.75.

Looking at the options, option A is $8.90 and $16.70, which is very close. Perhaps the problem expects rounding to the nearest cent, so 8.92 would be $8.92, but option A is $8.90. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects us to calculate without the fixed cost, but that doesn't fit the data points.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of m and b. Let me try another approach.

Let me use the two points to find the equation.

The two points are (100,5) and (700,28.5).

The slope m is (28.5 -5)/(700 -100) =23.5/600 =0.039166667.

Using point-slope form: y -5 = 0.039166667(x -100).

Expanding: y =0.039166667x - 0.039166667*100 +5.

0.039166667*100=3.91666667.

So y=0.039166667x + (5-3.91666667)=1.08333333.

So same as before.

Thus, for 200 miles, y=0.039166667*200 +1.08333333=7.83333334 +1.08333333=8.91666667.

So $8.92.

Similarly, for 400 miles: 0.039166667*400=15.66666668 +1.08333333=16.75.

Looking at the options, none have exactly these numbers. The closest is option A: $8.90 and $16.70.

But perhaps the problem expects rounding to the nearest tenth. So 8.91666667 rounds to $8.92, but option A has $8.90, which is 2 cents less. Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps I should check the calculations again.

Wait, 23.5 divided by 600 is exactly 0.0391666667.

Then, for 200 miles: 0.0391666667 *200=7.833333334.

Adding 1.08333333 gives 8.916666664, which is approximately $8.9167, which is $8.92.

But option A is $8.90, which is 2 cents less. Maybe the problem expects us to round down, but that's unusual.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the fixed cost to be zero, but that doesn't fit the data points.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have a different approach. Let me think differently.

Wait, perhaps the cost per mile is the difference in cost divided by the difference in distance. So the cost increases by $23.50 over 600 miles. So per mile, it's 23.50 /600 =0.039166667 per mile per pound.

So for 200 miles: 200 *0.039166667=7.83333334, which is $7.83. But that would be without the fixed cost. But when we include the fixed cost, it's higher.

Wait, but in the earlier calculation, the fixed cost is $1.0833 per pound. So if I transport for 0 miles, it would cost $1.08 per pound, which doesn't make sense. So perhaps the cost is purely variable, without a fixed cost, meaning b=0.

If that's the case, then y =0.039166667x.

So for 100 miles: y=3.91666667, but the given cost is $5. So that can't be right. Therefore, the fixed cost must be included.

So I think the correct answer is option A: $8.90 and $16.70, considering possible rounding in the options.
</think>

The problem involves determining the cost per pound to transport merchandise over different distances, given a linear relationship between cost and mileage. The data points provided are ($5.00 for 100 miles and $28.50 for 700 miles). 

To find the linear function describing the relationship, we use the two points (100, 5) and (700, 28.5). The slope (rate) is calculated as:

\[
m = \frac{28.5 - 5}{700 - 100} = \frac{23.5}{600} \approx 0.0391667 \, \text{dollars per mile per pound}.
\]

Using the point (100, 5) to find the y-intercept (\(b\)):

\[
5 = 0.0391667 \times 100 + b \implies b = 5 - 3.9166667 \approx 1.0833333.
\]

Thus, the linear function is:

\[
y = 0.0391667x + 1.0833333.
\]

For 200 miles:

\[
y = 0.0391667 \times 200 + 1.0833333 \approx 8.9166667 \approx \$8.92.
\]

For 400 miles:

\[
y = 0.0391667 \times 400 + 1.0833333 \approx 16.75.
\]

The closest option to these calculations is **A: $8.90 and $16.70**, which likely accounts for rounding.

Answer: A
