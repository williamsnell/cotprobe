Question:

A 54-year-old man comes to the physician because of episodes of fainting for 3 months. He also has had difficulty performing daily tasks because he is easily fatigued. He had a myocardial infarction 12 years ago. His pulse is 40/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 138/85 mm Hg. Physical examination shows evidence of cannon a waves. An ECG shows a P-wave rate of 90/min, and an R-wave rate of 40/min, with no apparent relation between the two. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

Options:

A: Second-degree atrioventricular block, type I
B: Left bundle branch block
C: Ventricular fibrillation
D: Third-degree atrioventricular block
E: Supraventricular tachycardia
F: Myocardial infarction
G: Right bundle branch block
H: First-degree atrioventricular block
I: Sinus bradycardia
J: Second-degree atrioventricular block, type II

Okay, let's try to work through this question step by step. So, the patient is a 54-year-old man with a history of myocardial infarction 12 years ago. He's presenting with episodes of fainting for three months and fatigue. His vital signs are pulse 40/min, which is pretty slow, BP 138/85, so it's a bit on the higher side but not critically high. His respirations are normal at 18/min.

The physical exam shows cannon a waves. From what I remember, cannon a waves are seen in aortic stenosis because the aortic valve doesn't open properly, leading to a delayed a wave in the jugular venous pulse. But wait, the question is about an ECG finding, so maybe that's a red herring, or perhaps it's pointing towards something else. Alternatively, cannon a waves can also occur in conditions where the atria are not contracting normally, like in complete heart block where the ventricles are being paced by a junctional or ventricular rhythm, causing the atria to contract with each ventricular beat, hence the cannon a waves.

Looking at the ECG data: P-wave rate is 90/min, R-wave rate is 40/min. So the P waves are faster than the R waves, meaning the ventricles are not following every P wave. There's no relation between the two, so it's not a 1:1 or 2:1 block. That suggests that the AV node isn't conducting every P wave to the ventricles.

So, let's think about the options. The question is about a 54-year-old with fainting and fatigue, and an ECG showing P at 90 and R at 40, with no relation. The cannon a waves are present, which might indicate a problem with the AV node or a bundle branch block.

Looking at the options:

A: Second-degree AV block, type I (Wenckebach) – this is when the block gets progressively longer until a beat is skipped. The P waves would decrease in amplitude and the PR interval would increase until a QRS is missed. But in the ECG described, the P and R rates are different, so maybe it's a second-degree block, but type I or II?

B: Left bundle branch block – this affects the ventricular depolarization but usually doesn't cause a significant change in the heart rate unless there's also a problem with conduction. The ECG would show a widened QRS, but the P and R rates wouldn't necessarily be so different unless there's a block beyond that.

C: Ventricular fibrillation – this is too fast and chaotic, with a pulseless rhythm. The patient's pulse is 40, which is regular, so this is unlikely.

D: Third-degree AV block – this is a complete block where the ventricles are being paced by their own rhythm. In this case, the P waves would be at their own rate, and the QRS complexes at a different rate, with no relation. The cannon a waves fit here because the atria are contracting with each ventricular beat, causing the a waves to coincide with the QRS complexes. So this might be the case.

E: Supraventricular tachycardia – this would cause a faster heart rate, but the R waves would be faster, not slower. Also, the P waves would have a different appearance, like a delta wave in some cases, but the rate here is lower, so not likely.

F: Myocardial infarction – he had one 12 years ago, but the current symptoms don't point to an acute MI. The ECG doesn't describe any ST changes, so probably not this.

G: Right bundle branch block – similar to left, it affects QRS but not necessarily the rates unless there's a block higher up. But the main issue here is the discrepancy in P and R rates.

H: First-degree AV block – this is a delay in conduction, so PR interval is prolonged, but P waves and QRS complexes are still in a 1:1 ratio. The rates here are different, so not this.

I: Sinus bradycardia – this would have P waves at the same rate as the R waves, and the pulse would be 40. But the ECG shows P at 90 and R at 40, which doesn't fit sinus bradycardia.

J: Second-degree AV block, type II (Mobitz II) – this is when the block occurs below the AV node, usually in the bundle branches. These are often 2:1 or 3:1 blocks. In Mobitz II, the block doesn't get progressively worse, and the P waves would continue at their own rate. So if the R waves are at 40 and P at 90, maybe a 2:1 block? But the question says no relation, so maybe not.

So putting it all together, the patient has a P wave rate higher than the R wave rate, no relation, and cannon a waves. This points towards a third-degree AV block, where the ventricles are being paced by a different mechanism, maybe a junctional rhythm. The cannon a waves support this as the atria are contracting synchronously with the ventricular contractions because the AV node isn't conducting, so the atria might be contracting on their own or in a different rhythm.

Wait, but in third-degree AV block, the P waves and QRS complexes are completely dissociated. So the P waves would continue at their own rate, and the QRS at the ventricular rate, which could be a junctional or ventricular escape rhythm. The cannon a waves are because each QRS is causing the a wave, meaning the atria are contracting at the same time as the ventricles, which can happen if the AV node isn't blocking but the atria are contracting with each ventricular beat. Hmm, but in a third-degree block, the P waves would be at the sinus node rate, which in this case is 90, and the ventricles would be at a slower rate, say 40, with no relation. So that fits.

So the answer is D: Third-degree atrioventricular block.

The patient is a 54-year-old man with a history of myocardial infarction, presenting with fainting and fatigue. His ECG shows P waves at 90/min and R waves at 40/min with no relation, and physical examination reveals cannon a waves. These findings suggest a complete dissociation between atrial and ventricular activity, characteristic of a third-degree atrioventricular block. In this condition, the ventricles are typically paced by a junctional or ventricular escape rhythm, leading to the observed discrepancy in rates and the presence of cannon a waves as the atria contract synchronously with ventricular contractions.

Answer: D
