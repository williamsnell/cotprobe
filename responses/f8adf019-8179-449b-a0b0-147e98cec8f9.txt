Okay, so I've got this problem about achromatic prisms. Hmm, I remember that an achromatic prism is made of two different types of glass, usually crown and flint, to correct for chromatic aberration. The idea is that the two prisms are designed so that for two different wavelengths (like red and blue), the deviation is the same, making the image appear without color fringing.

The question gives me the refractive indices for crown and flint glass at three wavelengths: 6563 Å (red), 5893 Å (yellow), and 4861 Å (blue). The crown glass has indices 1.5146, 1.5171, and 1.5233 respectively. The flint glass has 1.6224, 1.6272, and 1.6385. The crown prism has an angle of 10 degrees, and I need to find the angle of the flint prism so that the combination is achromatic.

Wait, achromatic condition usually involves the deviation for two wavelengths being equal. But here, since there are three wavelengths given, maybe it's more about the average or ensuring the prism doesn't cause chromatic dispersion? Or perhaps it's considering the mean deviation for the two outer wavelengths, red and blue.

I think the formula for the deviation of a prism is given by δ = (n - 1) * A, where A is the angle of the prism. But since we're dealing with two different materials, crown and flint, the total deviation would be the sum of the deviations from each prism. For achromaticity, the total deviation for two wavelengths should be the same.

Wait, no, more accurately, the condition for an achromatic prism is that the deviations for two different wavelengths (like red and blue) are equal when combined. But I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.

The formula for the deviation caused by a single prism is δ = (n - 1) * A. But when you have two prisms, one of crown and one of flint, the total deviation is the sum of the deviations from each. However, since one is crown and the other is flint, their deviations might subtract if they are in opposite orientations. Wait, no, the prisms are usually placed such that their deviations add but the materials are chosen to minimize the overall dispersion.

Wait, no, the correct approach is that for an achromatic combination, the deviations for two wavelengths must be equal. So, for red and blue light, the total deviation (crown deviation + flint deviation) should be the same for both wavelengths. Or perhaps, the deviation from the crown and flint prisms should negate each other's dispersion? Hmm, I'm getting a bit tangled here.

Wait, maybe the way it works is that for two wavelengths, the deviation from the crown prism and the flint prism combine such that the net deviation is the same for both, so that there's no net chromatic dispersion. So, perhaps the equation is: δ_crown + δ_flint = same for both wavelengths. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's that the difference in deviation between the two prisms for the two wavelengths cancels out.

Wait, let's get back. The condition for an achromatic prism pair is that the angular dispersion (the difference in deviation between two wavelengths) caused by the crown prism is exactly canceled by the dispersion from the flint prism. So, the total dispersion is zero.

The dispersion (D) for a single prism is given by D = (dn/dλ) * A, where dn is the change in refractive index with wavelength, and A is the prism angle. So, for the two prisms, the dispersions should be equal in magnitude but opposite in sign.

Wait, but the formula for the dispersion of a single prism is D = (n₂ - n₁) * (A), where n₂ and n₁ are the refractive indices for two different wavelengths. So, for the achromatic condition, the dispersion from the crown prism plus the dispersion from the flint prism should be zero.

Wait, but the prisms are made of different materials. So, the dispersion from the crown prism is D_crown = (n_crown_blue - n_crown_red) * A_crown. Similarly, the dispersion from the flint prism is D_flint = (n_flint_blue - n_flint_red) * A_flint. For achromatic condition, D_crown + D_flint = 0. So,

(n_flint_blue - n_flint_red) * A_flint = -(n_crown_blue - n_crown_red) * A_crown.

Wait, but I'm not sure if it's using blue and red, or another pair. Alternatively, maybe it's taking the average of all three, but I think the standard approach is to use the two extreme wavelengths for which the dispersion is to be canceled.

So, let's take the red (6563 Å) and blue (4861 Å) wavelengths. So, for crown glass, n_red = 1.5146, n_blue = 1.5233. So, Δn_crown = 1.5233 - 1.5146 = 0.0087.

For flint glass, n_red = 1.6224, n_blue = 1.6385. So, Δn_flint = 1.6385 - 1.6224 = 0.0161.

The dispersion from the crown prism is D_crown = Δn_crown * A_crown = 0.0087 * 10°.

The dispersion from the flint prism should be D_flint = Δn_flint * A_flint, but since they have to cancel, D_flint = -D_crown.

So,

Δn_flint * A_flint = - Δn_crown * A_crown.

But both Δn values are positive, so perhaps the prisms are arranged so that one causes a positive dispersion and the other a negative. So, perhaps:

(Δn_flint) * A_flint = (Δn_crown) * A_crown.

Wait, no, because for the total dispersion to be zero, the dispersions must be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. So,

Δn_flint * A_flint = - Δn_crown * A_crown.

Wait, but since both Δn are positive, their products would be positive. So maybe I should set the sum to zero:

Δn_flint * A_flint + Δn_crown * A_crown = 0.

But that would require one to have a negative angle, which doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the prisms have their angles arranged such that the dispersion from one is opposite to the other. So, perhaps:

Δn_flint * A_flint = - (Δn_crown * A_crown).

But again, angles are positive. So perhaps the correct approach is to equate the magnitudes but ensure their signs are opposite.

So, perhaps:

Δn_flint * A_flint = Δn_crown * A_crown.

Wait, but that would mean their dispersions are the same, which would not cancel. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, maybe the correct approach is that the total deviation for the two prisms should be the same for both wavelengths. So, for red light, the crown prism deviates by δ_crown_red = (n_crown_red - 1) * A_crown.

Similarly, the flint prism deviates by δ_flint_red = (n_flint_red - 1) * A_flint.

The total deviation for red is δ_red = δ_crown_red + δ_flint_red.

Similarly, for blue light, δ_blue = (n_crown_blue - 1) * A_crown + (n_flint_blue - 1) * A_flint.

For achromatic condition, δ_red = δ_blue.

So,

(n_crown_red - 1) * A_crown + (n_flint_red - 1) * A_flint = (n_crown_blue - 1) * A_crown + (n_flint_blue - 1) * A_flint.

Wait, but that's a bit complicated. Let me plug in the numbers.

n_crown_red = 1.5146, n_crown_blue = 1.5233.

n_flint_red = 1.6224, n_flint_blue = 1.6385.

A_crown = 10°, A_flint is what we're solving for.

So,

(1.5146 - 1)*10 + (1.6224 - 1)*A_flint = (1.5233 -1)*10 + (1.6385 -1)*A_flint.

Compute each term:

(0.5146)*10 = 5.146.

(0.6224) * A_flint.

On the right:

(0.5233)*10 = 5.233.

(0.6385) * A_flint.

So equation becomes:

5.146 + 0.6224*A_flint = 5.233 + 0.6385*A_flint.

Let me rearrange:

5.146 - 5.233 = 0.6385*A_flint - 0.6224*A_flint.

-0.087 = (0.6385 - 0.6224)*A_flint.

0.6385 - 0.6224 = 0.0161.

So,

-0.087 = 0.0161 * A_flint.

A_flint = -0.087 / 0.0161 ≈ -5.404 degrees.

Wait, that's negative. But prism angles can't be negative. Hmm, did I make a mistake in the setup?

Ah, perhaps I should think about the direction of the prisms. Maybe the flint prism is placed to counteract the crown's dispersion. Alternatively, perhaps the equation should have a negative sign because the prisms are arranged in opposite orientations, so their deviations subtract.

Wait, maybe the correct equation is that the total deviation for red equals that for blue, but the prism angles are arranged such that their deviations are in opposite directions. So perhaps:

(n_crown_red - 1) * A_crown - (n_flint_red - 1) * A_flint = (n_crown_blue - 1)*A_crown - (n_flint_blue -1)*A_flint.

Wait, but that seems a bit more complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the total deviation from both prisms for red is the same as for blue.

Wait, perhaps I should set up the equation correctly. Let me think again.

The total deviation for red is δ_red = (n_crown_red -1) * A_crown + (n_flint_red -1) * A_flint.

Similarly, δ_blue = (n_crown_blue -1) * A_crown + (n_flint_blue -1) * A_flint.

For achromatic condition, δ_red = δ_blue. So,

(n_crown_red -1) * A_crown + (n_flint_red -1) * A_flint = (n_crown_blue -1) * A_crown + (n_flint_blue -1) * A_flint.

Let me compute the left and right sides.

Left side: (1.5146-1)*10 + (1.6224-1)*A_f = 0.5146*10 + 0.6224*A_f = 5.146 + 0.6224*A_f.

Right side: (1.5233-1)*10 + (1.6385-1)*A_f = 0.5233*10 + 0.6385*A_f = 5.233 + 0.6385*A_f.

Set equal:

5.146 + 0.6224*A_f = 5.233 + 0.6385*A_f.

Subtract 5.146 from both sides:

0 + 0.6224*A_f = 0.087 + 0.6385*A_f.

Wait, that's 5.233 -5.146 = 0.087.

So,

0.6224*A_f = 0.087 + 0.6385*A_f.

Subtract 0.6385*A_f from both sides:

0.6224*A_f - 0.6385*A_f = 0.087.

(0.6224 - 0.6385)*A_f = 0.087.

(-0.0161)*A_f = 0.087.

So,

A_f = 0.087 / (-0.0161) ≈ -5.404 degrees.

Hmm, negative angle. That doesn't make sense because prism angles are positive. So perhaps I set up the equation incorrectly. Maybe the correct condition is that the deviations from the two prisms for each wavelength are such that their total is the same.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the two prisms are in contact, and the deviation from one is subtracted from the other. So, perhaps:

δ = δ_crown - δ_flint.

Wait, but that's not right because both prisms contribute to the total deviation. Alternatively, perhaps the correct equation is:

δ_red = δ_blue.

Which would involve the sum of the deviations from both prisms for each wavelength.

Wait, but I'm getting a negative angle, which suggests that the equation needs to be set up differently. Maybe I should instead consider that the dispersion from the flint prism is opposite to that of the crown.

Wait, maybe I should use the formula for dispersion. Dispersion D = (n₂ - n₁) * A. For the two prisms, D_crown = (n_blue - n_red) * A_crown.

Similarly, D_flint = (n_blue' - n_red') * A_flint, where n_blue' and n_red' are the refractive indices for flint glass.

Wait, but the condition is that D_crown + D_flint = 0. So,

(n_blue_crown - n_red_crown) * A_crown + (n_blue_flint - n_red_flint) * A_flint = 0.

So,

(1.5233 - 1.5146) * 10 + (1.6385 - 1.6224) * A_flint = 0.

Calculate:

0.0087 *10 = 0.087.

0.0161 * A_flint.

So,

0.087 + 0.0161 * A_flint = 0.

0.0161 * A_flint = -0.087.

A_flint = -0.087 / 0.0161 ≈ -5.404 degrees.

Again, negative. Hmm. So maybe I'm missing a negative sign somewhere. Alternatively, perhaps the flint prism should have a smaller angle to compensate.

Wait, perhaps the correct condition is that the dispersions are equal in magnitude but opposite in sign. So,

(n_blue - n_red) * A_crown = - (n_blue_flint - n_red_flint) * A_flint.

Wait, but that would mean:

0.0087 *10 = - (0.0161)*A_flint.

0.087 = -0.0161 * A_flint.

A_flint = -0.087 / 0.0161 ≈ -5.404. Still negative.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula uses the reciprocal, like A_flint = (Δn_crown / Δn_flint) * A_crown.

Wait, Δn_crown = 0.0087, Δn_flint = 0.0161.

So, A_flint = (0.0087 / 0.0161) *10 ≈ (0.5404)*10 ≈ 5.404 degrees.

But that gives a positive angle. Wait, but if the dispersion of the flint is higher, perhaps the angle should be smaller to balance. So, maybe the correct approach is:

A_flint = (Δn_crown / Δn_flint) * A_crown.

Which would be (0.0087 / 0.0161) *10 ≈ 5.404 degrees.

Looking at the options, option F is 5.40 degrees. That's positive, so maybe that's the correct answer.

Wait, but earlier calculations gave me a negative angle, which suggests that perhaps the flint prism needs to have a smaller angle to counteract the higher dispersion. Wait, but in the calculation above, the angle comes out positive 5.4 degrees, which is option F.

Alternatively, maybe I should take the reciprocal, like A_flint = (Δn_flint / Δn_crown) * A_crown.

Which would be (0.0161/0.0087) *10 ≈ 1.8505 *10 ≈ 18.5 degrees, which isn't an option. So probably not.

Wait, but according to the calculation, the equation gives A_flint ≈ -5.4 degrees, which is not possible. So perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Maybe the correct condition is that the sum of the deviations is zero, so:

(n_blue_crown - n_red_crown) * A_crown + (n_blue_flint - n_red_flint) * A_flint = 0.

Which gives 0.0087*10 + 0.0161*A_flint = 0.

0.087 + 0.0161*A_flint = 0.

A_flint = -0.087 / 0.0161 ≈-5.404 degrees.

But since angles can't be negative, perhaps the correct approach is to take the magnitude, so 5.4 degrees, which would be option F.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the flint prism's dispersion is opposite in sign, so the equation should be:

(n_blue_crown - n_red_crown) * A_crown = (n_red_flint - n_blue_flint) * A_flint.

Because then,

0.0087*10 = (1.6224 -1.6385) * A_flint.

0.087 = (-0.0161) * A_flint.

A_flint = 0.087 / (-0.0161) ≈-5.404. Still negative.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Maybe the correct condition is that the angular dispersions cancel each other, so:

A_crown * (n_blue_crown - n_red_crown) + A_flint * (n_blue_flint - n_red_flint) = 0.

Which is what I did earlier, leading to A_flint ≈-5.404 degrees.

But since angles can't be negative, perhaps the correct approach is to take the absolute value, so the flint prism's angle is 5.40 degrees, which is option F.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the crown and flint prisms have opposite angular dispersions, so:

A_crown * (n_blue_crown -n_red_crown) = - A_flint * (n_blue_flint -n_red_flint).

Which would mean:

0.0087 *10 = - A_flint *0.0161.

0.087 = -0.0161 A_flint.

A_flint = -0.087 /0.0161 ≈-5.404. Again, negative.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for another approach. Let's consider the general formula for an achromatic prism combination. The condition is that the angular dispersions from the two prisms are equal and opposite. So,

D_crown = -D_flint.

Where D = (n_blue - n_red) * A.

So,

(n_blue_crown -n_red_crown) * A_crown = - (n_blue_flint -n_red_flint) * A_flint.

Plugging numbers:

(1.5233 -1.5146)*10 = - (1.6385 -1.6224)*A_flint.

0.0087 *10 = - (0.0161)*A_flint.

0.087 = -0.0161 * A_flint.

A_flint = 0.087 / (-0.0161) ≈-5.404 degrees.

Still negative. Hmm. But that's not possible, so perhaps I made a mistake in the sign convention.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct equation is:

(n_blue_crown -n_red_crown) * A_crown + (n_blue_flint -n_red_flint) * A_flint = 0.

Which gives the same result as before, leading to a negative angle.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the prisms being in contact, so their angular deviations for each wavelength are additive. So, for the combination to be achromatic, the deviations for the two wavelengths must be the same. So,

δ_red = δ_blue.

Which would mean,

(n_crown_red -1) * A_crown + (n_flint_red -1) * A_flint = (n_crown_blue -1) * A_crown + (n_flint_blue -1) * A_flint.

Which is the same equation as before, leading to the same result.

Hmm. So, unless I made a calculation error, the answer seems to involve a negative angle, which isn't possible. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the correct condition is that the deviations from the two prisms for each wavelength are such that their sum is the same for all wavelengths. But that's similar to what I did.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the average of all three wavelengths. Maybe the correct approach is to use the mean refractive index for each glass and calculate based on that.

Let me compute the mean refractive indices for crown and flint.

For crown: wavelengths 6563, 5893, 4861.

n_red =1.5146, n_yellow=1.5171, n_blue=1.5233.

Mean n_crown = (1.5146 +1.5171 +1.5233)/3 = (4.555)/3 ≈1.5183.

Similarly, for flint:

n_red=1.6224, n_yellow=1.6272, n_blue=1.6385.

Mean n_flint = (1.6224 +1.6272 +1.6385)/3 = (4.8881)/3 ≈1.6294.

Then, the condition for achromatic prism is that the product of (n-1) and the angle is the same for both prisms. So,

(n_crown -1)*A_crown = (n_flint -1)*A_flint.

So,

(1.5183 -1)*10 = (1.6294 -1)*A_flint.

0.5183 *10 = 0.6294 * A_flint.

5.183 = 0.6294 * A_flint.

A_flint =5.183 /0.6294 ≈8.23 degrees.

Hmm, that's around 8.2, but the options don't have that. The closest is option H:8.15, but that's close. But wait, maybe using the mean is not the correct approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to use the two extreme wavelengths (red and blue) and calculate the necessary angle.

Wait, going back, I think the correct approach is that the sum of the angular dispersions should be zero. So,

Δn_crown * A_crown + Δn_flint * A_flint =0.

Which gives,

0.0087 *10 + 0.0161 * A_flint = 0.

0.087 + 0.0161 A_flint =0.

A_flint = -0.087/0.0161 ≈-5.404 degrees.

But negative angle doesn't make sense, so perhaps taking the absolute value, 5.4 degrees, which is option F.

But earlier when I set up the equation using the deviations for each wavelength and equated them, I got A_flint ≈-5.4 degrees.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is 5.4 degrees, positive, which would be option F.
</think>

To determine the angle of the flint-glass prism for an achromatic combination with the crown-glass prism, we use the condition that the angular dispersions of the two prisms cancel each other. The dispersion for a prism is given by:

\[
D = (n_{\text{blue}} - n_{\text{red}}) \cdot A
\]

For the achromatic condition:

\[
D_{\text{crown}} + D_{\text{flint}} = 0
\]

### Step 1: Calculate the dispersion for the crown glass
The refractive indices for crown glass at red (6563 Å) and blue (4861 Å) are:
\[
n_{\text{crown, red}} = 1.5146, \quad n_{\text{crown, blue}} = 1.5233
\]
\[
\Delta n_{\text{crown}} = n_{\text{crown, blue}} - n_{\text{crown, red}} = 1.5233 - 1.5146 = 0.0087
\]
The angle of the crown prism is:
\[
A_{\text{crown}} = 10^\circ
\]
Thus, the dispersion for the crown prism is:
\[
D_{\text{crown}} = \Delta n_{\text{crown}} \cdot A_{\text{crown}} = 0.0087 \cdot 10 = 0.087
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the required dispersion for the flint glass
For the achromatic condition:
\[
D_{\text{flint}} = -D_{\text{crown}} = -0.087
\]
The refractive indices for flint glass at red (6563 Å) and blue (4861 Å) are:
\[
n_{\text{flint, red}} = 1.6224, \quad n_{\text{flint, blue}} = 1.6385
\]
\[
\Delta n_{\text{flint}} = n_{\text{flint, blue}} - n_{\text{flint, red}} = 1.6385 - 1.6224 = 0.0161
\]
The angle of the flint prism is:
\[
A_{\text{flint}} = \frac{D_{\text{flint}}}{\Delta n_{\text{flint}}} = \frac{-0.087}{0.0161} \approx -5.404^\circ
\]

Since prism angles cannot be negative, we take the magnitude:
\[
A_{\text{flint}} \approx 5.40^\circ
\]

### Step 3: Verify the result
The calculated angle of the flint prism is approximately \(5.40^\circ\), which matches option **F**.

**Answer: F**
