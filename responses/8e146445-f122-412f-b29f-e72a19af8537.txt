Question:

A woman duly executed a will under which she devised her farm to her nephew and bequeathed the residue of her estate to her niece. For 12 years after executing her will, the woman lived on her farm. Then she sold it and used the sales proceeds to purchase a home in the city, in which she lived until she died, never having changed her will. Following the admission of the will to probate, both the nephew and the niece claimed ownership of the home. There is no applicable statute. Who is the owner of the home?

Options:

A: The nephew, because of the doctrine of ademption.
B: The nephew, because of the doctrine of equitable estoppel.
C: The niece, because of the doctrine of lapse.
D: The niece, because she is the residuary legatee.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this wills and estates question. Let me read it carefully.

So, there's a woman who made a will. In it, she devised her farm to her nephew and bequeathed the residue of her estate to her niece. Then, she lived on the farm for 12 years, sold it, and used the proceeds to buy a home in the city where she lived until she died. She never changed her will. Now, both the nephew and the niece are claiming ownership of the home. There's no applicable statute, so I guess I have to rely on common law.

Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my wills and estates, but let me think. When someone makes a will, they can devise specific property, and the residue goes to the residuary legatee. So here, the nephew gets the farm, and the niece gets everything else.

But wait, the woman sold the farm. So what happens when a testator sells a specific devise after making the will? I remember something about ademption. Ademption is when the testator sells or otherwise disposes of property that was specifically devised in the will. If that's the case, the devise is defeated, and the property doesn't pass under the will anymore.

So, the nephew was supposed to get the farm, but she sold it. Under the doctrine of ademption, the gift to the nephew would be defeated because the farm no longer exists. That would mean the nephew doesn't get anything from the farm anymore.

But then, she used the proceeds from selling the farm to buy a home. So, the money from the farm sale went into buying the new home. Now, does the home become part of the residue? Because the will says the residue goes to the niece.

Wait, but the problem is that the nephew is claiming ownership of the home. The niece is also claiming it. So, what's the status of the home under the will?

Let me think step by step. When the woman made the will, she gave the farm to the nephew. The residue, which would be everything else, went to the niece. Then she sold the farm, which was a specific devise. Under ademption, the nephew's gift is taken away because she no longer owns the farm. So the nephew doesn't get the farm or any proceeds from it.

But the proceeds from the sale went into purchasing the home. Now, the home is her property at the time of her death. Since the will didn't mention the home, it would be part of the residue. But wait, the residue was given to the niece. So, the home should go to the niece.

Alternatively, does the sale of the farm affect the home? No, because the home was purchased with the proceeds. The will didn't say anything about the home, so it's part of the residue. So the niece, as the residuary legatee, would get the home.

Wait, but what about the nephew's claim? He's claiming under ademption, but I think ademption only affects the specific devise. So he loses the farm, but the proceeds from selling it are part of the estate. Since she didn't use the proceeds to buy anything else, but instead bought a home, which is part of the residue.

So the home is part of the residue, which goes to the niece. Therefore, the niece owns the home.

Looking at the options:

A: Nephew via ademption. But ademption would mean he loses the farm, not that he gains the home.

B: Nephew via equitable estoppel. I don't think that applies here; equitable estoppel is more about preventing injustice when someone relies on a promise, but I don't see that scenario here.

C: Niece via lapse. Lapse usually applies when a legatee dies before the testator, but that's not the case here. The niece is alive, so lapse doesn't apply.

D: Niece as residuary legatee. Yes, because the home is part of the residue, and she's the residuary.

So the answer should be D.

The woman's will devised her farm to her nephew and bequeathed the residue of her estate to her niece. After selling the farm, the proceeds were used to purchase a home, which became part of her estate. Under the doctrine of ademption, the nephew's interest in the farm was defeated because the woman no longer owned it at her death. The home, purchased with the proceeds, is part of the residue of the estate, which was bequeathed to the niece. Therefore, the niece, as the residuary legatee, owns the home.

Answer: D
