Okay, so I've got this question here: "In how many ways can 5 students be selected from a group of 6 students?" The options are A through J, with various numbers. I'm trying to figure out the right answer.

Hmm, I remember that when selecting a subset from a larger group where the order doesn't matter, it's a combination problem. So I think I should use combinations here. Combinations are used when the order isn't important, unlike permutations where order does matter.

Wait, the problem says selecting 5 students from 6. So the formula I should use is the combination formula, which is n choose k, or C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n - k)!). Here, n is 6 and k is 5.

Let me plug in the numbers. So C(6,5) would be 6! divided by (5! times (6-5)!). Simplifying that, 6! is 720, 5! is 120, and (6-5)! is 1! which is 1. So that would be 720 / (120 * 1) = 720 / 120 = 6. So the answer should be 6 ways, right?

Wait, but let me make sure. Another way to think about it is that choosing 5 out of 6 is the same as leaving out 1 student. How many ways can I leave out 1 student from 6? Well, that's 6 different ways, each corresponding to leaving out a different student. So that also gives me 6, which matches the earlier calculation.

Looking at the options, F is 6. So I think F is the correct answer.

The problem involves selecting 5 students from 6, which is a combination problem. Using the combination formula C(6,5) = 6, the answer is F.

Answer: F
