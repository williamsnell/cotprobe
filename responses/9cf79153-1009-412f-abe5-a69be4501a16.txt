Okay, let's try to figure out this problem. So, the machine takes 12 minutes to fill 200 bottles. I need to find out how long it will take to fill 500 bottles. Hmm, I think I should start by finding out the rate at which the machine fills the bottles.

Wait, so if it fills 200 bottles in 12 minutes, how many bottles does it fill per minute? Maybe I can calculate the rate by dividing the number of bottles by the time. So, 200 divided by 12. Let me do that: 200 ÷ 12 equals... let's see, 12 times 16 is 192, so 200 divided by 12 is approximately 16.666... bottles per minute. Hmm, that seems right.

Now, if I know the rate per minute, I can find out how long it takes to fill 500 bottles. So, I need to divide the total number of bottles by the rate. That would be 500 divided by (200/12). Wait, another way to think about it is, since 200 bottles take 12 minutes, I can set up a proportion. Let me write that down.

200 bottles / 12 minutes = 500 bottles / x minutes.

So, cross-multiplying, 200x = 500 * 12. Let me compute 500 times 12. 500 * 10 is 5000, and 500*2 is 1000, so together that's 6000. So, 200x = 6000. Then, divide both sides by 200 to solve for x. 6000 ÷ 200 is 30. So, x equals 30 minutes. Wait, but that seems a bit fast. Let me check my calculations again.

Alternatively, maybe I can find how many times 200 goes into 500. 500 divided by 200 is 2.5. So, if it takes 12 minutes for 200, then 2.5 times that would be 12 * 2.5. Let me calculate that: 12 * 2 is 24, and 12 * 0.5 is 6, so 24 + 6 is 30. Yeah, that confirms it. So, 30 minutes is the answer.

Looking at the options, E is 30 minutes. So, I think E is the correct choice.

The machine fills 200 bottles in 12 minutes, so the rate is 200/12 ≈ 16.666 bottles per minute. To fill 500 bottles, time = 500 / (200/12) = (500 * 12) / 200 = 30 minutes.

Answer: E
