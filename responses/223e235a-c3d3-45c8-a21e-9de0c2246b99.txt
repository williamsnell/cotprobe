Question:

5.3-19. Two components operate in parallel in a device, so the device fails when and only when both components fail. The lifetimes, $X_1$ and $X_2$, of the respective components are independent and identically distributed with an exponential distribution with $\theta=2$. The cost of operating the device is $Z=2 Y_1+Y_2$, where $Y_1=\min \left(X_1, X_2\right)$ and $Y_2=\max \left(X_1, X_2\right)$. Compute $E(Z)$.

Okay, so I've got this problem here about two components operating in parallel. The device fails only when both components fail. Each component has a lifetime modeled by an exponential distribution with parameter θ=2. The cost is given by Z=2Y₁ + Y₂, where Y₁ is the minimum of the two lifetimes and Y₂ is the maximum. I need to find the expected value of Z, E(Z). 

Hmm, let's break this down. First, since the components are operating in parallel, the device fails when both fail. So, the device's lifetime is actually the minimum of X₁ and X₂ because the device can't operate once either component fails. Wait, but the problem defines Y₁ as the min and Y₂ as the max. So Y₁ is the time until the first failure, which would cause the device to stop. But then, what's Y₂? It's the maximum of the two, which would be the lifetime of the component that didn't fail first. 

The cost function is Z=2Y₁ + Y₂. I need to compute E(Z) = E(2Y₁ + Y₂) = 2E(Y₁) + E(Y₂). So if I can find E(Y₁) and E(Y₂), I can compute E(Z).

Now, Y₁ and Y₂ are the minimum and maximum of two independent exponential variables. Exponential distributions are memoryless, which might help here. Let me recall some properties. For two independent exponential variables X₁ and X₂ with parameter θ, the minimum Y₁ has a distribution with parameter 2θ, because the probability that the minimum is greater than t is the probability that both X₁ and X₂ are greater than t, which is (e^{-θ t})² = e^{-2θ t}. So Y₁ ~ Exp(2θ).

Wait, but θ is given as 2 in the problem. So θ=2, so Y₁ ~ Exp(4) because 2θ=4. The expectation of Y₁ is 1/(2θ) = 1/4? Wait no, wait. Wait, the expectation of an exponential distribution with rate λ is 1/λ. So if Y₁ ~ Exp(4), then E(Y₁)=1/4. But wait, is that correct? Because Y₁ is the min of two exponentials with rate θ=2 each. So the rate for Y₁ is 2θ=4, so E(Y₁)=1/4. Hmm, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes people use θ as the mean, not the rate. Let me check.

The exponential distribution can be parameterized in two ways: either by the rate λ, where the pdf is λ e^{-λ t}, or by the mean θ, where the pdf is (1/θ) e^{-t/θ}. In this problem, it says θ=2, so I think θ is the mean. So the rate λ would be 1/θ = 1/2. Therefore, the pdf of X₁ and X₂ is (1/2) e^{-t/(2)} for t ≥ 0.

So, Y₁ is the minimum of X₁ and X₂. The pdf of Y₁ is then 2*(1/2) e^{-t/2} = e^{-t/2} for t ≥ 0, which is exponential with rate 1/2, but wait, no. Wait, if X₁ and X₂ are independent exponentials with rate λ=1/2, then the min Y₁ has rate 2λ = 1. Because the CDF of Y₁ is P(Y₁ ≤ t) = 1 - P(X₁ > t and X₂ > t) = 1 - (e^{-λ t})² = 1 - e^{-2λ t}, so the PDF is the derivative, which is 2λ e^{-2λ t}. So if λ=1/2, then 2λ=1, so Y₁ ~ Exp(1), meaning E(Y₁)=1.

Wait, that contradicts my earlier thought. So I need to get this straight. Let me clarify. The problem states that X₁ and X₂ are exponential with θ=2. If θ is the mean, then the rate λ is 1/θ = 1/2. So each X has pdf (1/2) e^{-t/(2)}. Then, the minimum Y₁ will have a rate of 2*(1/2)=1. So Y₁ ~ Exp(1), which means E(Y₁)=1.

Similarly, Y₂ is the max of X₁ and X₂. The expectation of the max of two independent exponentials can be found using the formula E(max(X₁,X₂)) = (2 λ)/(λ₁ + λ₂) when X₁ and X₂ have rates λ₁ and λ₂. But since both are the same, λ₁=λ₂=1/2. So E(Y₂) = (2*(1/2))/( (1/2)+(1/2) ) )= (1)/1 =1. Wait, that can't be right because the max should be larger than the min. Alternatively, perhaps I should derive E(Y₂) directly.

Alternatively, I know that for two independent variables, E(max(X,Y)) = E(X) + E(Y) - E(min(X,Y)). Since both X and Y have mean θ=2, E(X)=E(Y)=2. So E(max(X,Y))=2+2 - E(min(X,Y))=4 - E(Y₁). We already found E(Y₁)=1, so E(Y₂)=4-1=3. Therefore, E(Y₂)=3.

Wait, but earlier when I thought Y₁ had E=1, but if θ=2, and Y₁ is min of two such variables, shouldn't that be different? Let's check again. 

If X and Y are exponential with mean θ=2, so rate λ=1/2. Then min(X,Y) has rate 2λ=1, so E(Y₁)=1/(2λ)=1/(1)=1? Wait no, wait. No, wait, the expectation of an exponential distribution with rate λ is 1/λ. So if Y₁ has rate 1, then E(Y₁)=1/1=1. So that part is correct.

So E(Y₁)=1, E(Y₂)=3. Then, E(Z)=2*1 +3=5. So the answer would be D:5.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating E(Y₂). Another approach: the expectation of the maximum of two independent exponentials. The formula for E(max(X,Y)) when X and Y are independent exponentials with means a and b is (a b)/(a + b) + max(a,b). But in this case, a = b =2. So E(max)= (2*2)/(2+2) +2= (4/4)+2=1+2=3. So yes, that matches the earlier result.

So putting it together, E(Z)=2*1 +3=5. So the correct option is D:5.

To compute \( E(Z) \) where \( Z = 2Y_1 + Y_2 \), we first determine \( E(Y_1) \) and \( E(Y_2) \). 

Given \( X_1 \) and \( X_2 \) are independent exponential variables with \( \theta = 2 \) (mean), the rate \( \lambda = 1/2 \). The minimum \( Y_1 = \min(X_1, X_2) \) has a rate of \( 2\lambda = 1 \), so \( E(Y_1) = 1 \).

For the maximum \( Y_2 = \max(X_1, X_2) \), we use the relationship \( E(\max(X,Y)) = E(X) + E(Y) - E(\min(X,Y)) \). Substituting \( E(X) = E(Y) = 2 \) and \( E(Y_1) = 1 \), we find \( E(Y_2) = 2 + 2 - 1 = 3 \).

Thus, \( E(Z) = 2E(Y_1) + E(Y_2) = 2(1) + 3 = 5 \).
