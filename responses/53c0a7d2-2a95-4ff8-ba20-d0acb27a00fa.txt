Okay, so I have this economics question about finding the market supply curve. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question is asking what you do to find the market supply curve for a particular good. The options are various ways of aggregating different curves—like revenue, supply, demand, marginal revenue, and marginal cost curves. I remember that supply curves are about how much a firm is willing to supply at different prices, right?

Wait, a market supply curve is the sum of all individual firms' supply curves. So, I think each firm has its own supply curve, and to get the total supply for the market, you add them up. But how exactly do you add them? Vertically or horizontally?

Let me recall. When you're adding individual curves to get a market curve, supply curves are typically added horizontally. For example, if you have two firms, each with their supply curve, the market supply at any given price is the sum of each firm's quantity supplied at that price. So you move along the price axis and add the quantities. That sounds like a horizontal aggregation.

Looking at the options, let's see. Option B says aggregate the firm supply curves horizontally. That sounds right. Option J is aggregating vertically, which I think would be for demand curves. Like, for demand, you sum the quantities at each price by adding vertically because each consumer's demand adds to the total. So for supply, it's the opposite—each firm's supply adds up at the same price, hence horizontal aggregation.

Other options: A and F are about revenue, but supply isn't directly about revenue. C and G are demand curves, which are for consumers, not suppliers. D and I are about marginal revenue, which again is a different concept. E and H are about marginal cost; while marginal cost is part of a firm's supply curve, the question is about aggregating supply curves, not cost curves.

So the correct method is to aggregate each firm's supply curve horizontally at each price point. So the answer should be B.

To find the market supply curve, you aggregate individual firm supply curves horizontally. This means adding the quantities supplied by each firm at each price level to determine the total market supply.

Answer: B
