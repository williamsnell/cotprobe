Okay, so I've got this problem about a train set production and pricing. Let me try to break it down step by step because I'm a bit confused but I'll work through it.

First, the problem says that each train set costs $10 to produce, regardless of how many are made. So the cost is fixed at $10 per unit. That probably means the total cost will be 10 times the number of sets produced, right? So if they make x sets, the total cost is 10x.

Next, the demand function is given as p = 90 - 0.02x, where x is the number of sets sold and p is the price retailers pay. So this is a linear demand function, which makes sense. The price depends on how many sets are sold. The more sets you sell, the lower the price per set because of the negative slope.

The question has two parts: (a) finding the profit function and the number of units to maximize profit, and (b) determining the price retailers pay.

Let me tackle part (a) first. I know that profit is calculated as total revenue minus total cost. So, Profit = Revenue - Cost.

Revenue is the number of units sold times the price per unit. So Revenue = x * p. But p is given by the demand function, so substituting that in, Revenue = x*(90 - 0.02x). Let me expand that: 90x - 0.02x².

Total cost is straightforward: since each set costs $10, Cost = 10x.

So putting it together, Profit (π) = Revenue - Cost = (90x - 0.02x²) - 10x. Let me simplify that. 90x minus 10x is 80x, so Profit = 80x - 0.02x².

Wait, that seems right. So the profit function is π = -0.02x² +80x. Alternatively, π = 80x - 0.02x². Either way is correct.

Now, to find the number of units that maximizes the profit, I remember that for a quadratic function in the form ax² +bx +c, the maximum or minimum occurs at x = -b/(2a). Since the coefficient of x² is negative here (-0.02), the parabola opens downward, so the vertex will be the maximum point.

In this case, a = -0.02 and b = 80. So plugging into the formula: x = -80/(2*(-0.02)) = -80 / (-0.04) = 2000. So x=2000 sets. That's the number of units to produce to maximize profit.

Wait, let me check that again. The formula is x = -b/(2a). Here, a is -0.02, so 2a is -0.04. So x = -80 / (-0.04) = 2000. Yep, that's right.

So the profit function is π = 80x -0.02x², and maximum profit occurs at x=2000 units.

Now, part (b) asks for the price retailers pay. Once we know x, we can plug it back into the demand function p = 90 -0.02x.

So when x=2000, p = 90 - 0.02*2000 = 90 -40 = $50.

Wait, but looking at the options, let's see. The options are combinations of sets, total profit, and price. So part (a) asks for the amount of units and the profit function, but the options also include profit amounts. Hmm, maybe I need to calculate the maximum profit as well.

Wait, the problem says part (a) is about the profit function and the number of units to maximize profit. So I think the options might be combining both (a) and (b). Let me see the options.

Looking at the options, each has three parts: units, profit, and price. So for each option, the first number is units, second is total profit, third is price.

From my calculations, units are 2000, price is $50, and profit would be calculated as (price * units) - (cost per unit * units). Let me compute that.

Price is $50, units 2000, so Revenue is 50*2000= $100,000. Cost is 10*2000= $20,000. So Profit = 100,000 -20,000= $80,000.

Wait, but looking at the options, let's see which one has units=2000, price=50, and profit=80,000.

Looking through the options:

Option H: 2000 sets, $80,000, $50. That matches exactly.

Wait, but let me double-check the profit function. Profit at x=2000: π=80*(2000) -0.02*(2000)^2. So 80*2000=160,000. 0.02*(2000)^2=0.02*4,000,000=80,000. So π=160,000 -80,000=80,000. Yes, that's correct.

So the answer should be option H: 2000 sets, $80,000 profit, $50 price.

Wait, but let me look at the options again. Option H is 2000, $80,000, $50. That's correct. So I think H is the right answer.

The profit function is π = 80x - 0.02x². To maximize profit, the optimal number of units is 2000 sets. At this level, the price retailers pay is $50, and the total profit is $80,000.

Answer: H
